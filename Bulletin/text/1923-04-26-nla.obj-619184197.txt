The Red Page
A Shropshire Lad
I am never likely to forget the manner of
the first beginning of my close acquaintance
with the poetry of Alfred Hausman. Living
in those far-off and shadowy days before the
war in a small Belgian village, I was quite
accustomed to be locally known as “the Rus-
sian.” Belgium, self-centred and busy, was
on the whole indifferent to foreign influence,
and, where not indifferent, inclined ..to be sus-
picious. The basket-makers and gunmakers
of the village knew nothing of England, and
had never heard of Australasia. But Rus-
sians were not unknown: thousands of stu-
dents, expelled from their own country, were
attending Belgian universities; and in vaca-
tion-time they found flieir way into the plea-
sant country where the valley of the Meuse
widens out towards Holland. They were
foreigners who spoke a strange tongue; they
did extraordinary things. So did the woman
who lived in the tall brick house by the
Crucifix at the corner of the Ruelle; there-
fore, she was Russian, too, and there could
no doubt about it.
There were, however, perhaps lralf-a-hun-
dred Britishers in the provincial capital, the
heart of Wallonia—- mostly people of little
position and less money—and they had banded
together to form an English Club. Their
meetings were held in an ill-lighted, unclean
room. One night amongst these dingy and
depressing surroundings there rose up an Eng-
lishman who spoke with a purity of accent, and
with that felicity of language which has
since made the work of Wilfrid Thorley
known to many readers, on the function of
poetry, illustrating his remarks by quota-
tions from a little hook of poems called “A
Shropshire Lad.” Published some years be-
fore, it had not at first attracted general
attention, but had soon found its way .into
popular favor, and was as warmly welcomed
by the semi-edueated many as by the criti-
cal fe\?. That was a test of great poetry,
Wilfrid Thorley said. The room in which
he. spoke with such unforgettable enthusiasm
exists no more, though the English Club has
risen again like a phoenix from the flames.
I'n the terrible months of their entry into
Belgium, the Germans destroyed the whole
row of poor houses in which the Club had
its locale, and massacred most of the male
inhabitants out upon the cobbles of the
square. As to the earnest and guileless stu-
dents who listened there that night, most of
them are sleeping in the cemetery upon the
hill where lie the defenders of the Ardent
City, or upon the desolate battlefields. But
the poetry of Alfred Hausman still endures.
What is tlie reason of its popularity? “A
Shropshire Lad” was in no sense an inno-
vation. Its philosophy was negative, it pre-
sented no fresh problems of life or thought,
but rather those which are obvious and
ever present, and in it idea and emotion
are expressed through set and classical
forms of rhyme and metre. Yet it preserves
its old power of stimulating and satisfying
the sense of beauty in the reader’s mind,
and gives the same delight to-day that it
did 20 years pgo. The themes about which
these little poems are built are slight enough
—they are sometimes even trite enough. But
they are not ephemeral; they are perma-
nent. The years pass, and in 'our own days
we have seen empires fall, but Love and
Life and Death and Beauty in all its mani-
festations —in the color of flowers, in the
solemnity of the storm, in the music that
the west wind makes in the trees —those
things do not change. Soldiers may wear
lchaki or scarlet, but their end is the same:
Far and near and low and louder
As the ends of earth go by,
Dear to friends and food- for powder,
Soldiers marching, all to die;
East and west on fields forgotten '
Bleach the bones of comrades slain,
Lovely lads and dead and rotten ;
None that go return again.
And until warfare is not only abolished but
the very memory of ancient battles has
faded, this poem and the horror of the holo-
caust of young lives will be true. Also,
though a healthy art may—perhaps must —
have its roots in nationalism, its applica-
tion to humanity is international. Home-
sickness is the- same, whether for the grey
stone-built farm under the green elms by
Severn stream, or for the old home away
back on the drought-stricken plains under
tlie broad Australian sky. There is hardly
a poem of. Alfred Hausman’s which deles
not touch universal emotion, universal mind.
That is where, I think, some of us Austral-
asian writers fail. We can describe our bush,
the life of our new lands, the way we talk,
the look of our countries; but we have not
always the power of illuminating the outer
presentment so that all men in all countries
may understand. Nor have we either, with
all our endeavor, all our imagination, our
capacity, our very real achievement, yet
gained, save very rarely, this distinction'of
style, this mastery over our own language
which characterise these little poems writ-
ten by the Professor of Latin at Cambridge.
Perhaps it is a thing which is not easily
gained by those born. and bred in countries
yet in the making. Yet we are the heirs
of European culture.- Catullus and Virgil
are ours, Homer sang for us, Shakspeare
sprang from our race. Herrick and Suck-
ling and all the wonderful minor masters of
music, polished and repolished their verse
for us. Some day we, too, shall learn this
perfection, this command over material and
method, this inevitableness of words, this
balance, this harmony, and then—we also
shall be amongst the "immortals.
During more than 20 years after the pub-
lication of “A Shropshire Dad” the lute of
Alfred Hausman remained silent. The
Professor continued to lecture,, to elucidate
Latin texts and occasionally to write witty
an.d original verses in the albums of his
friends, but no serious poetical work saw
the 'light. It seemed as if the songs were
sung and all the flowers garlanded. That
was not, however, the opinion of the land-
lady who .year by year was accustomed to
receive the bachelor poet in a grey-walled,
grey-roofed village in the delicious West
Country where Severn loses itself in the sea,
and at Easter-time the fields are golden
with dancing daffodils. “He is writing.”
she would say; “yon must wait, and you
will see!” In October, 1922, the second
volume, the “Last Poems,” appeared. Thev
do not break new ground—that was not to
be expected; they have not, perhaps, the'
freshness of emotion of- the earlier ones.
“I can no longer expect to be revisited by
the continuous excitement under which in
the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater
part of my other book,” says the author
in a disarming preface. “Nor. indeed, could
I well sustain it if it came.” But one at least,
‘'The Culprit,” is equal to any of the poems
in the old volume, and all are written with
this same lucidity and charm, this fitness
of word which satisfies the most fastidious
ear, this polish and perfection of art: —
The lofty shade advances,
1 fetch my flute and play:
Come, lads, and learn the dances
And praise the tune to-day.
' ‘ \
To-morrow, more’s the pity,
Away we both must hie,
To air the ditty,
And to earth I.
Poets must, indeed, like golden lads and’
chimney-sweepers, come to dust, but their
music does not die, and the hands of the
young are ready to snatch the lute that
drops from their fingers.
DORA WLLCOX.
Artists in Irony
Hilary Lofting (R.P., 22/3/#), under
the heading “A Modern Satire,” makes some
shrewd shots at Thackeray, and some just
observations in defence of Swift; but I am
not sure that he distinguishes satire from
irony. The satirist attacks his objective
from the outside. The ironist works at the
heart of the citadel, and undermines its de-
fence in the disguise of one of its defenders.
The superficial reader is often deceived, and
accepts a piece of exquisite irony for an
essay in sheer realism. Even the artist in
creative literature can be led astray in his
estimate of an ironic masterpiece, as were
both Sir Walter Scott and W. M. Thackeray
in their appraisement of Fielding’s “History
of the Life of the Late Mr. Jonathan Wild
the Great,” which, in the opinion of that
acute critic, W. E. Henley, “is in some
ways Fielding’s masterpiece, and which is
certainly one of the masterpieces of English
literature” :
The truth is, the book is an exemplar, and the
best we have, of a certain mode in letters ; and the
mode which it examples is Irony: a mode in which
few Englishmen have excelled. It is given to few to
love Irony for its own sake ; to still fewer to delight
in the ironical presentation of life and character,
which in this book Fielding essays with complete
success. What did the vulgar think of it? What
but that they have always thought of what they
could not understand.
One can readily understand Thackeray’s
failure to grasp Fielding’s purpose. There
is in all W.M.T.’s efforts to raise his mental
altitude to the plane of the ironic the per-
vasive malice that infects the servants’ hall,
and expends itself in derogatory whisper-
ings between Jeames and ’Enrietta behind
the backs of their “betters,” and for the
cheapening of the envied grandeur of my
lord and my lady. The social criticism (if
the Grand Mogul of Snobdom has always
the suggestion of the betrayal of intimate
secrets. Moreover, the reader feels instinc-
tively that the "'shafts of Thackeray’s satire
would glance vainly off the armor of his
victim if the income of the latter were in-
creased by a few hundreds a year, or if his
coat-breast were bedizened by another order
or two. The region of true irony is found
in the nature of things themselves, and in
the unalterable decrees of Fate, and not in-
the negligible pettifoggery of attendant cir-
cumstances. Thackeray was lacking in any
appreciation of the fact that morals, no less
than manners, represent stages of a definite
evolutionary development. His censure is
always early- or mid-Victorian, like his
gushes of uncontrollable sentimentality,
which are laughable if they are not humor-
ous. But this quality (it is but just to admit)
was the hallmark of liis epoch, and was
shared in equal quantum by Ills rival
Dickens, and his bete noir Bulwer Lytton.
It was the disease of the age.
No man was more unfitted, by the nature
of his mental limitations, than Thackeray
to give a series of lectures on the English
humorists, and nothing he ever did more
accurately defines those limitations; with
his supercilious patronage of Fielding, his
apologies for the ruffianism of Smollett, liis
lofty disgust at the “nastiness” of Sterne, and
his playful excuses for the free-and-easy im-
providence of Steele. The savagery with
which lie falls on Swift out-Swifts in savag-
ery anything Swift ever wrote of an indi-
vidual. for “Gulliver” was a man of many
true and sincere friends of a lifetime’s con-
tinuance.' Gay and Pope, Arbutlmot and
Bolingbroke, and many others were very
dear to the austere old Dean, and he could
write: “The death of Mr. Gay and the
Doctor ) Arbuthnot] ' have made terrible
wounds near my heart.” Thackeray was
not very much of a human brother to human
brother; be did not really like Dickens, and
he detested and maligned Byron and Bul-
wer Lytton; though, in his writings, his
heart overflows with saccharine slops for the
great indiscriminate multitude, and particu-
larly for poor, silly women of the Amelia
Sedley and Laura Bell type. His limitations
are defined no less accurately in his “Four
Georges” than in his “English Humorists.”
lie was .very British —vulgarly British ; and
he Shows a certain ’Arry-out-for-a-houting
swankiness in his observations (vide the
“Sketch Books,” etc.) on persons and things.
The most, humorous thing about “The Irish
Sketch Book,” and wonderfully symptoma-
tic of the author’s perception of the fitness
of things, was the dedication to the Irish
novelist , Charles Lever— a tribute that
aroused the virtuous aud patriotic wrath of
the folk-lore poet Sir Samuel Fergusson,
whose “Fairy Thorn” is one of the choicest
ballads of its kind in English literature.
The “Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo”
notebook might have been done infinitely
better by the author of “Innocents Abroad,”
and Mark Twain could not have been guilty
of Thackeray’s Cockney belittlement of every
movement of the past and every historic
edifice. But Thackeray could throw away
the cap and bells and forget the sentimental
pocket-handkerchief when he went to see a

“Man Hanged”; and he could write a book
which well-nigh approaches the truly ironic,
“Catherine,” albeit with lapses into the
moralising, and the scoffing and the super-
cilious, and even into the baldly realistic—
all of which the heaven-born Ironist instinc-
tively avoids.
Realism, in striving after a grace beyond
art, in the limning of the real, sometimes
creates the effect of irony—a kind of ironic
travesty of the genuinely ironic creations
of the artistic mind. We find such effects
in the monstrous criminals depicted by Bal-
zac; on which the novelist lavishes a whole
vocabulary of titanic adjectives, which fail
to convince the reader of the inevitableness
of their intrinsic verity. But the border-
line between the ironic and the realistic,
though subtle, is clearly defined; neverthe-
less, it is felt rather than perceived, as wit-
ness that alleged masterpiece in the philo-
sophical-CMw-political species of ironic writ-
ing, Edmund Burke’s “Vindication of Natu-
ral Society,” which has been considered
rather a masterpiece of imitative style than
an ironic parody of argument. Indeed, Vis-
count Morley says of it : “Excellent judges
of style made sure that the writing was
really Bolingbroke’s, and serious critics of
philosophy never doubted that the writer,
whoever he was, meant all he said.”
Reference has been made to Henley’s
dubiety as to whether Fielding should not
be considered a successful contestant with
Swift for the first place in English letters as
Ironist,, by the grace of the “History of the
Life of the late Mr. Jonathan Wild the
Great.” It may be answered by the admis-
sion that Swift has not written so important
and so massive a piece of pure irony ; though
for ironic intensity there is nothing in English
Literature to compare with, or to surpass,
some of his various papers on religion, morals,
etc.,. particularly the “Modest Proposal for
Utilising the Children of Poor People in
Ireland,” “An Argument Against Abolishing
Christianity in England,” and the famous
“Directions to Servants,” which has, by the
way, a cynical forerunner and prototype in
Daniel Defoe’s ironical “Complete English
Tradesman.” In “Gulliver’s Travels” Swift
is satiric rather than ironic, because he is
obviously laughing, jeering, lashing and de-
nouncing the follies, the stupidities, the affec-
tations, the insincerities and brutalities of
mankind.
FRED J. BROOMFIELD.
George Gordon McCrae
The group of writers that Marcus Clarke
gathered round him in Melbourne when lie
edited the Colonial Monthly, in the ’six-
ties, included Gordon, Kendall, •’Orion”
Horne and McCrae. The surviving member
is George Gordon McCrae, our oldest poet,
who on May 29 will celebrate his 90th birth-
day.
Mr. McCrae, who resides in Muir-street,
Hawthorn, arrived in Melbourne six years
after it was founded. He was then eight
years of age, so his career almost syn-
chronises with the growth of the city. The
’forties were known as the pastoral period,
and Rolfe Boldrewood, whose father was an
early citizen of Melbourne, has referred to
the time as the happiest of his life. Latrobe,
the Governor, was one of a cultured group.
He had published four volumes of travel, one
of which was dedicated to his friend Wash-
ington Irving. I)r. Godfrey Howitt, the
brother of William, the poet, was another
early resident. His brother Richard, who
stayed at his cottage for a while, wrote a
chatty volume on the social life of Melbourne
between IS4O and 1844 ; and Mr. McCrae has
recorded his impressions of the ’forties in the
Victorian Historical Magazine, Novem-
ber, 1912. He mentions that two visitors to
his father’s house were Ben Boyd and Oswald
Brierly, the artist. There was one theatre,
in which melodramas and farces were pro-
duced, but the main distractions were private
parties, public dinners, and a procession
when a Governor arrived.
In the ’fifties Mr. McCrae became
acquainted with Nicholas Chevalier, the
cartoonist on Melbourne Punch, and began
to iearn drawing and painting. He ex-
hibited at the first exhibition of the Victorian
Society of Fine Arts in 1857, when his
mother, Mrs. A. M. McCrae, who was an
accomplished musician and artist, showed
some of her miniatures. In the ’sixties
Mr. McCrae published his first volumes of
verse, “Balladeadro” and “Mamba,” founded
on aboriginal legends; the third long poem,
“Karakorok,” which completes the trilogy, is
still in manuscript. Another volume of
poetry, “The Man in the Iron Mask,” con-
tains the impression, “Morning at Sea in
the Tropics,” which Longfellow selected for
his anthology of “Poems of Places.” A
volume of his later verse was issued a few
years ago; and several of his best-known
poems appear in Australian anthologies. His
novel, “John Rous,” was published in 1918.
Since he retired from the position of senior
examiner of patents in the Victorian Gov-
ernment service he has had nearly 80 years
to devote to literature. The major part of
his work is still in manuscript: it includes
about 10 novels, a number of short stories
and some poems. Then there are interest-
ing contributions to the history of our litera-
ture in a life of Kendall, Gordoniana, and
reminiscences of Richard Hengist Horne.
There are several impressions of travels, a
history of Seychelles, and essays on various
subjects. There is also a drama on the sub-
ject of Charlotte Corday : this was to have
been produced in Melbourne, but at the last
moment the arrangements fell through.
Mr. McCrae has seen the little settlement
of Melbourne transformed into a spacious
city, and has watched the development of art
and literature in Victoria since their incep-
tion. As an original member of the Yoriek
Club, he knew all the choice spirits of his
day. No one has a more intimate knowledge
of the earlier social life of the city; and it
is gratifying to know that, at the request of
his friends, he is now writing his reminis-
cences. Gifted with a marvellous memory,
he can talk about episodes of the ’forties,
the ’fifties and the ’sixties as if they had
occurred during this century. “The early
Melbourne period, 1841 to 1850, is long since
completed,” he says; “the year 1854, per-
haps the most interesting of all, is almost
finished, and I am writing well ahead of
that now.”
The talents have descended through four
generations of the McCrae family. The
accomplishments of Mr. McCrae’s mother
have already been referred to; his son Hugh
and his daughter Dorothy Frances (Mrs.
Perry) have several volumes of poetry to
their credit; and Hugh’s three daughters,
Mardi, Huntly and Rose, have the artistic
strain. The last-named made her debut in
the latest number of Home, with the draw-
ings for her father’s satire, “The Art of Julia
Chittlepeck.”
It is a pity there is no way of formally
honoring writers here, as France honors
hers. It is to be hoped, however, that Mr.
McCrae’s 90th birthday will not be allowed
to pass without some recognition. He is one
of those modest men who would not seek for
anything of the kind, but that is only one
more reason why he should receive it.
WILLIAM MOORE.
Louis Lavater
The fields of fancy on the more thickly
peopled side of the river of thought are con-
nected by airy bridges with the wide realms
of imagination beyond. Louis Lavater, in
This Green Mortality (Endacott, Melbourne),
does not often attempt to cross the stream.
He sings gently in verses that run closely
in the footsteps of much else that has gone
before, and only occasionally steps aside to
mark the different falling of a shadow or
pluck a wayside blossom. His manner is
generally in keeping with his themes. He
is neither held by the richer music of words
nor by their tenderer magic; yet he is not
unmusical nor without quiet tones. The
general color of his work is neither drab nor
grey; it takes on a soft shade of green—a
green seldom touched by full sunshine. That
is not to say that Louis Lavater lacks vigor.
Take for example “Songs a Man Shall
Sing” :
What are the songs a man shall sing
To save his soul alive?
For the soul that is shrunken and parched with pain
Thirsts for a song as a field for rain,
And he that is faint and ready to swoon
Leaps to the lilt of a marching tune.
Then what are the songs a man shall sing
To save his soul alive?
They are songs of daring on field and foam ;
Songs of women and babes at home;
Songs of achievement, of things well done,
Songs of hearty, uproarious fun;
Songs of birds and bees and flowers,
Of walking abroad in sunny hours ;
Songs that swell in the heart like seeds
To burgeon and blossom in kindly deeds.
They may be neither new nor strange—
For simple folk are slow to change—
But they must be true and they must be sweet
To warm the heart and to stir the feet;
And the songs that are sweet beyond all others
Shall draw men close as a band of brothers.
These are the songs a man shall sing
To save his soul alive.
There is force in that, even if it is not a
force that goes very far.
In the “Rising of the Sap” an opposite
effect is produced. There the rush and
energy of the Spring is set to slow music: —
While yet too soon eye-prisoning darkness falls,
And Winter trails his ragged overalls,
There wakes up in my spirit suddenly
An elfin something that says: “Come with me! ”
Then leafy fingers flutter into mine,
And off we scamper, at a secret sign,
To pagan orgies in some woodland lair
Stark joyous mad with blossoms in our hair.
Sometimes the singer is in a different mood:
No cloud in either heaven —for there are two —
The lake smiles upward with an equal blue;
And at its foot the little town is' seen,
A swimmer’s garments flung upon the green.
Those wind-blown petals drifting white and red
Are browsing cattle o’er the pasture spread—
Fat, sleepy meadows, drunken with the spring
And noonday honey smeared on everything.
Good as most of that is, the end of the pic-
ture is surely very unfortunate. It is hardly
possible to think of anything more insulting
to the good yellow sun than the suggestion
of a smeary mess.
There are several good sonnets which,
though they may not sing themselves
into long remembrance, have the true move-
ment. Here is “Tides” :
Distraught by care I wandered by the sea
In nobler strife to find heart-comforting:
Alas! far as the eye its net could fling
Lay bare a desolate monotony
Of slimed waste that held no joy for me,
No battle-swirl, no marshalled thundering:
But in the shallows some unsightly thing
Beat out its life in rhythmic agony.
I pressed from out my eyes the omen dread,
Lifting the wet sand to my fevered face,
Until, serene at last and comforted,
I turned again unto the self-same place—
To see upon the smiling shore outspread
A fair green garment fringed with foamy lace.
And there are a few essays in the “free
verse” which is not verse at all. The best
that can be said for these is that they are
much less virulent than the average article
in that they approach more nearly to rhythm.
One little song is as attractive as anything
in the book —it is called “My Slim Green
Love”: —
In the thick, thick dark
Of the summer night
Hangs a shimmery garment
Of netted light,
Where my dear Love whispers
And trembles and weaves
A robe of starshine
About her leaves.
All day she flutters
Her kil tie green;
At night draws round her
This soft star-sheen;
And I would that the wisdom
Of earth could teach
What she whispers now
In her leafy speech!
There is not much that is new or strange
in this book, nothing that soars very high
nor falls very low; but there is throughout
a feeling for quiet green places not far off
into which the singer is determined to march.
D.M.W.
A Martyred Land
Those who knew Bailleul in the years im
mediately preceding its last bombardment
will remember a bookshop, a few yards from
the main square, on the Steenwerck-road.
One of the first volumes the stout proprietress
always tried to sell inquirers after foreign
literature was De Coster’s “Legend of Ulen-
spiegel,” for though she lived in France
she was a patriotic Fleming. The new Eng-
lish edition of the Belgian classic (the trans-
lator is F- M. Atkinson, and the publisher
Heinemann) is without the vivid illustrations
of the cheaper French edition that the Dig-
gers knew, but the production is vastly
superior, and the translation has been admir-
ably done.
From beginning to end this strange work
breathes the spirit of the grim, crude, bitter
and superstitious country over which the
legions of Europe have periodically surged
in bloody conflict for a thousand years. The
visitor to the old church at Dranoutre (a
town as Flemish in character as though it
had been 50 miles, instead of half-a-mile,
from the French border) was confronted by
a full-length statue of a martyr being shot
to death with arrows. The head lolled on
the shoulder, the mouth was open in a howl
of agony, and where the arrows had pierced
the body huge gouts of a material like red
sealing-wax stuck to the skin. That is the
kind of lesson they require in Flanders,
where centuries of warfare, oppression,
treachery and cruelty have killed such fine
feelings as the peasants ever had. An aged
stranger in De Coster’s story has stumbled
into a trap set by Ulenspiegel to catch the
village weer-wolf :—
Suddenly the weer-wolf spake and said: “Have
pity upon me, pity, Ulenspiegel.”
“The wolf talks,” said the villagers, crossing them-
selves. “He is a devil and he knows Ulenspiegel’s
name already.”
“Have pity, pity,” said the voice; “bid the bell
be quiet; it is ringing for the dead; pity, I am no
wolf. My wrists are pierced by the engine; I am
old and I bleed; pity! What is this shrill boy’s
voice awaking the village ? Pity! ”
“I heard thy voice of old,” said Ulenspiegel, vehem-
ently. “Thou are the murderer of Claes. Men and
women have no fear. ’Tis the demon, he through
whom Betkin died.”
And holding him by the neck beneath the chin
with one hand, with the other he drew his cutlass.
But Toria, Betkin’s mother, stayed him in his
movement.
“Take him alive,” she cried.
And she plucked out his white hairs by handfuls,
and tore his face with her nails.
And she howled with grief and fury.
The weer-wolf, his hands fast in the engine, and
stumbling about the roadway, through his keen
sufferings—“ Pity,” said he. “Pity!” Take this woman
away. Break those bells! Where are those children
that arc calling?”
“Keep him alive!” cried Toria. “Keep him alive!
Let him pay! The bells for the dead, the death bells
for thee, murderer. By slow fire, by red-hot pincers.
Keep him alive! Let him pajM”
Meanwhile Toria had picked up on the road a
waffle-iron with long arms. Looking closely at it
in the light of the torches, she saw it deeply engraved
between the two iron plates with lozenges in the
Brabant fashion, but armed besides, like an iron
mouth, with long, sharp teeth. And when she opened
it, it was like the mouth of a greyhound.
Then Toria, holding the waffle-iron, opening it and
shutting it and making the iron ring, seemed as
though she had lost her wits for male fury, and
gnashing her teeth and with hoarse rattling breath
like one dying, bit the prisoner with this engine in
the arms, the legs, everywhere, seeking most of all
his neck, and with every bite saying: “Thus he did
to Betkin, with the iron teeth. He pays. Dost
thou ble.ed, murderer? God is just. The bells for
the dead! Betkin is calling me to revenge. Dost
thou feel the teeth? ’Tis the mouth of God.”
And she hit- him .without .ceasing, .and without,pity,
striking him with the waffle-iron where she could
not bite him with it. And because of her great
thirst for revenge she did not kill him.
De Coster was what is known to-day as a
pacifist. In a hundred passages such as
the above he satirises the insanity of that
hatred and lust for revenge which culminate
in war and the downfall of the innocent.
The book is not all anguish, of course.
Ulenspiegel himself typifies the kind, cheery,
healthy-minded youth whom Belgium might
produce as readily as any country, if left
in peace. But in general the lesson is that
a nation which has to endure war on its own
territory must achieve a warped mind. De
Coster takes as his period the time when Wil-
liam of Orange was contending with Philip
of Spain in the Low Countries; a time
when every stranger was a suspected spy,
and when the penalty for traitorism was a
hideous death. Had he lived till 1914 he
would have seen the same horrors, inspired
by the same emotions of fear, hatred and
the desire for revenge, perpetrated in the
name of the same God —-Protestant or
Catholic, according to the taste of the per-
petrator—the only difference being that dur-
ing the Great War everything was on an
infinitely larger scale. The Belgian peasants
were voted an unlikeable and inexplicable
lot by the armies that encountered them in
the World War. This brilliant book should
create a more understanding attitude. It is
an exposure,, an interpretation and a justi-
fication all in one. Incidentally, it provides
a smashing reply to those curious patriots
in our midst who argue that if Australia is
to go to war it must resolve to fight no-
where but on its own soil. The generation
that fights on its own soil is a ruined gen-
eration—ruined mentally and morally as
well as physically and economically.

A Satchel of Books
The Story of the British Navy, by Harold F. B.
Wheeler (Harrap and Co.). A re-telling in readable
form of the main features of the great naval epic
from the beginnings away back in early Britain
down to Jutland and Scapa Flow. The author dedi-
cates the volume to his nephews, and it is an excel-
lent book to place in the hands of the nephews of
other people. There are a number of effective illus-
trations in color by ex-Digger Ellis Silas.
Egypt, Old and New, by Percy F. Martin, F.R.G.S.
(Allen and Unwin). A book that will get a fillip
to its sales through the recent discoveries in Egypt,
though it was written before Tutankhamen’s funeral
affairs were brought to light. The author calls it
“A popular account of the land of the Pharaohs
from the traveller’s and economist’s point of view,”
and has turned out an interesting volume, though a
trifle guide-booky in places. He points out that of
the 14,000,000 Egyptians, three-fourths are fellahin,
or peasants, and 92 per cent, of them illiterates; yet,
freed from the old-time oppression that made them
acquiescent and submissive, they have become a new
people with new impulses and new ambitions. Still,
he doesn’t seem to be enthusiastic about . their
capacity for running their own country now that,
after 40 years, British occupation is coming to an
end. The book has many illustrations, including
some remarkably fine photographs in color.
Australia: A Commercial and Industrial Hand-
book, by A. W. Ferrin (U.S. Dept, of Commerce).
The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, to
whose many valuable publications this comprehensive
handbook has been added, modestly describes it as
“commercial and industrial.” It really covers much
more ground than that; it deals particularly well,
■for - wstawee,- wit*; tun" political' and-- -to <smne !
with our social life. The author, a former U.S.
Trade Commissioner in Australia, proves himself a
careful observer, and, so far as he expresses opinions,
a fair critic. He looks at us with American eyes,
of course, but only for the purpose of noting differ-
ences between his own country and ours ; and that
makes as good reading for Australians as for Ameri-
cans. Almost inevitably there are errors, but they
are surprisingly few and not vital; and the letter-
press is illustrated by many graphs and maps.

The purchase of a Case Tractor, is a sound investment, returning good
interest through years of faithful service. The Case is reliable, cuts down
farm costs to a minimum, and is so constructed, and backed by engineering
service, that replacements can be quickly and cheaply supplied when such
are required.
The Case Radiator—One of many exclusive features of CASE Tractor Construction
This radiator, made in CASE
Workshops, is of the copper
fin and tube, non-clogging type
with a cast-iron frame.
The radiator is made in five
parts, the core being supported
by two cast sides bolted to the
cast upper and lower sections
which act as reservoirs. This
Qnn

(y)
makes an absolutely rigid con-
struction, and is the only de-
sign that will withstand the
weaving and vibration that a
Tractor radiator is subjected
to, and removes a source of
considerable trouble resulting
from the use of radiators of
less sturdiness.
The cooling system is of large
capacity and very effective. The
amount of water evaporated in a
day’s operation under ordinary
service conditions is negligible,
and the CASE engine never boils
—just one reason for CASE
Tractor economy.
The CASE Tractor may be run
on the hottest day without trouble
from overheating.

Smiles.
Oh, sisters mine, God gave us smiles
In place of richer things,
Our sure defence in every age,
And so we hold our heritage,
A royal gift of kings.
The night alone, for night is kind,
May see the proud mask fall;
It does not call from weary eyes.
Astrain with tears, the brave disguise
That day demands of all.

Quiet.
I love the peace of placid rooms
Where tranquil silence smiles asleep,
While Fancy nods above her looms
And gently homing shadows creep
Across the dusk to sweep away
The lingering miseries of day.
I love the calm of quiet hearts
Whose memories hallow bygone pain
Until a gladsome courage starts
With faith and hope to bloom again
And scatter fragrance down the road
Where we go toiling with our load.
But most I love when day is past,
And flowers in darkness drink the dew
To find unsullied peace at last
Alone with you, alone with you !
To bless you kiss by kiss as we
Lie clasped in our eternity!

Love calls clarionly, hill to hill;
Our love lives for this death of a day ;
I’ll come back soon when my heart’s more
still.
Good-bye—l dare not stay.
It’s all been uttered and done before,
Older than fate is the magic of this —-
A girl and a man by a lonely shore.
But, God, how new it is!
It’s all been uttered and done before —
Oh, bravely managed and truly said!
The kisses of friends that shall be no more
Than friends till the suns are dead.
Never to part again, never to meet —
It’s old as danger, calm as the moon.
Trouble still shuffles his muffled feet.
Good-bye, I shall see you soon.
See you ! I have not seen a mark
Of fire on your brow or love on your face.
We are two dim voices fumbling the dark.
Good-bye for a little space.
Space as narrow as our pressed lips.
Deep as the sky depth, clouded as pain.
Wide as these spaces of stars and ships.
Good-bye, we shall meet again.

The Young Day.
Gold and azure the young day gracing,
What is the use of grieving, sighing?
Down the Harbor the yachts go racing,
Up the Harbor the gulls come flying.
All is freshness and new-born splendor—
What does it profit to mope and worry?
Idleness is a blossom tender,
Spoilt by the canker of haste and hurry.
Seawinds whisper of ways of pleasure—
Leave to others the stress of battle;
Pleasant it is to lie at leisure
Here on the rocks where the ripples prattle.
Shame it is, and a thousand pities—
Tragic, too, as a tear-stained story; —
Men should labor in smoky cities,
Deaf and dead to the young day’s glory !
Ere youth falls from its stem to wither.
Greying, fading and wmnly wasting,
Ye that are young, make haste, come hither,
Wine of wonder and beauty tasting!
Beauty tasting and splendor facing—
Who would change them for grieving, sigh-
ing?
Down the Harbor the yachts go racing,
Up the Harbor the gulls come flying.

“The East.”
A woman lives across the way:
Why did I make my home so near,
Where very often I can hear
Her lovers pass, and what they say?
For I shall seek her, too, some day,
And fawn on her like them, I fear!
Palm-fronds, which have the languid lure
Of stealthy lashes; butterflies
Among them; a lagoon that lies
Beneath their shadow, holding sure
Drowned secrets, evermore secure —
These fascinations are her eyes.
Carved coral atolls are her rings;
Bracelets of emerald islets flash
Upon her limbs; with cymbal-clash
Of sky and sea in dance she sings,
Across the twilight ocean, things
That burn the heart to poppy-ash.
The trader to the tropics came:
She knew not joy from sin before,
But now she is half slave, half whore
And procuress, known by each name
Of places busy with her shame —
Macassar, Kupang, Singapore.
Go, then, to her who will! forget
The hope for hands held out to you
Like little roses fresh with dew,
And aproned household comfort set
In firelight; for you have not met
All her demands until you do.

OUR JOINT AND SEVERAL DEBTS.
An Australian Treasurer of originality and
vaulting ambition might be moved by a per-
usal of the British budget to attempt great
things. The British financial year closed
on March 31, and the statement for the new
year was delivered about two weeks later,
and not six months later, as it generally is in
these parts. By levying £2O per inhabitant
in taxes, as compared with £l2 (Federal and
State) in Australia, a surplus of £lOl,OOO 000
was produced, and, resisting all temptations
to play the happy goat with the money, it
was applied in reduction of debt, thus sav-
ing some millions a year in interest. A
certain reduction had to be made in taxation
to pacify an oppressed people, but the Bri-
tish national cashier has provided to the
best of his ability for a surplus of £40,000.000
at next March in order to shift some more
of the mountain of war liability—this appa-
rently in addition to the specific annual pay-
ment to the United States in reduction of
Uncle’s very specific lOU. The impression
created is that the British Chancellor of the
Exchequer really enjoys paying off debt, and
looks at the sky-towering form of the
national P.N. rather in the light of a foeman
worthy of his steel. Also, the situation sug-
gests that he is thinking more about easing
the interest burden for Posterity than about
giving Posterity’s father a happy-go-lucky
time to-day. Both ideas are foreign to Aus-
tralian tradition, but an original and ambi-
tious Treasurer might be impressed by them.
In Australia there are three layers of debt
—Municipal, State and Federal —hhd the
national financier considers he has done all
that can be expected of him if he takes rea-
sonable thought for the last, and lets the
first and second go hang. Other Federations
have three layers of debt likewise, but in
none save ours have the States gone on such
a monetary debauch that it is the doings
of these minor bodies, and not those of the
National Government, that threaten to land
the country in a place where there is plenty,
of shabby and disreputable company. In
Britain the Commonwealth and the States
are one, for the sufficient reason that there
are no States, so the competent Chancellor
who looks after and retrieves the finances
has a wide and soul-satisfying sphere of use-
fulness. There is no reason why an Austra-
lian Treasurer with a wide outlook should
not, to a considerable extent, control State
borrowings and be likewise widely useful,
and there is need that he should. The
States owe £100,000,000 more than the Fed-
eration, despite that they never had a war
to pay for, and two of them at least have
been blessed with land revenues which should
have paid for most, if not all, of their public
works —have dropped works from Heaven as
a free gift, in a manner of speaking. The
Commonwealth really has a sinking fund,
or, at least, six separate payments for sink-
ing-fund purposes appeared last year in
as many different Commonwealth spending
departments, and there used to be seven.
Whether they were different funds didn’t
appear, but the contributions were: Prime
Minister’s office, £550; Home and Terri-
tories, £1863 ; one railway, £6195; another
railway, £5910; Works and Railways gen-
erally, £11,677; and Postmaster-General,
£16,193. One consequence of these or simi-
lar activities was that the Commonwealth
owed £18.235 less in September than in March,
1922. It wasn’t much, but the corner had
been turned, and the liability of £415,000,000
is being overtaken, unless the effort has since
perished by the wayside, at the rate of £3OOO
a month. The States likewise have six sink-
ing funds, but they don’t profess to overtake
anything—not even a worm. Possibly by
reason of the money that is put into them
four funds had less in them when last heard
from than at some previous date.
* * * *
Now that the Hughes Government of
grandiose gestures has been moved out of
office, a real, honest Federal sinking fund is
looked for. But there is little satisfaction
for an ambitious financier in taking £1 per
head off his subjects’ load if another autho-
rity, the worst of three borrowing authori-
ties, simultaneously puts £5 on. The Com-
monwealth has certain powers in the way
of taking over and unifying State debts, but
the question is large, mixed and difficult,
and the natural Australian tendency is to
brood over it at length, the same as with the
matter of the uniform railway gauge. It is
highly questionable, indeed, whether any
Treasurer save the capable and conscientious
George Turner even took the trouble to
brood. And, again, there would be little
satisfaction in taking over old State debts if
it only meant giving the States more facili-
ties for incurring new debts. During, the
brief lifetime of the Commonwealth the
States have increased their aggregate owings
from £200,000,000 to over £500,000,000, so
they have quite sufficient facilities already.
Likewise, there would be no satisfaction at
all in changing a State burden into a Fed-
eral one if it remained the same old perma-
nent, unshiftable load on the same people
only under a different name.
w * * *
In the first days of union, before an Aus-
tralian note issue or a Commonwealth Bank
were definitely on the horizon, The Bul-
letin detailed a scheme by which the Com-
monwealth should establish a State sinking
fund of its own, which is a matter of paying
debts, and leave the taking-over process,
which is merely a change in the manner of
owing them, to be settled subsequently. It
was suggested that the community could
easily buy from the Government and find a
use for somewhere between 10 and 20 mil-
lions’ worth of paper money, and as the
amount now in use, quite apart from the
£lOOO paper tokens which are a mere excres-
cence, is about £38,000,000, the possibilities
of the case were greatly under-rated. The
money thus made available, less the neces-
sary gold reserve, was to be invested in the
purchase of existing State securities in the
open market, and the income derived from
them was to be similarly invested, this process
of making great wealth out of nothing to
continue until there were no more State
securities to be bought or until the world
came to an end. In other words, the cumu-
lative demon of compound interest was to
be set working overtime; and, as he never
dies, time wouldn’t matter. If the acquisi-
tion of all the State debts happened before
the end of the world, then the pile of secu-
rities could be burned, and the collection of
interest ended ; but, considering the capacity
of State Ministries to create new debts, the
betting would naturally be on the end of the
world as winner of the race. The Govern-
ment recognised the feasibility of the idea
by adopting it —all save the essential fea-
ture. It bought State securities with its
new paper wealth right enough, but, instead
of buying old securities as a step towards
the extinction of debt, it subscribed new
loans, so that State financiers might have the
wherewithal to make the razzle a trifle more
furious. This encouragement—in other
words, the provision of a new uncle to
borrow from—may help to explain how it is
that what used to be considered a good seven
years’ State razzle is now easily crowded
into three. So once more Australia missed
the ’bus, and lost a glorious opportunity of
paying old debts out of nothing. Fortunately,
though the old debt remains and has been
added to enormously, the Commonwealth
Bank also remains, and is available to be
seriously employed as a public debt extin-
guishing agency. So far it has been chiefly
concerned with its own magnification for its
own glory.
THE JURY SYSTEM.
“Good case, a judge; bad case, a jury.”--— Advocate’s
maxim.
When the jury system first emerged during
the Dark Ages it was no more than a form
of arbitration and conciliation between rich
and rich. Four knights chose 12 knights to
adjust property disputes between two or
more knights, and the 12 arrived at a deci-
sion in the light of their special knowledge
of the circumstances. As villeinage began
to vanish, and a class of small capitalists to
appear, the jurors ceased to be men of con-
sequence except in cases of particular im-
portance. And forthwith the jury system
entered on its present role, which is that
of a beautiful and unprotected maiden in
the toils of villains bent on her undoing.
Ordeals by fire and water were abolished
early in the 13th century, but the theory on
which they rested—namely, the guilt of the
suspect —persisted in the minds of the ruling
classes, who also held that in any property
dispute, and more especially in any land dis-
pute, the poor party was bound to be wrong
and the rich one right. Verdicts had to be
unanimous, and when they were not the
jury was afforced: that is to say, its con-
tumacious members were replaced by others,
and so on till a decision was arrived at.
Jurors were allowed neither fire, food, lights
nor bedclothes while they were deliberating.
And where their verdicts were distasteful to
those in authority they were liable to be
fined, imprisoned and otherwise penalised.
Yet the period was the golden age of the
jury system. There is an old fable about
a wayfarer whose cloak Wind attempts
vainly to tear off him ; and then Sun comes
out, and with one genial smile* causes the
resister to remove the garment. The pri-
vileged classes of England made Wind’s mis-
take in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.
They strengthened the jury system, and gave
it a prestige which it did not deserve —nine
juries out of ten were weak and cowardly
even during the national struggle for liberty
of speech and religion—by persecuting it.
Every Briton resents being bullied, but many
are amenable to the milder persuasion of
bribery; and it was to jury-squaring that
men of substance often resorted when they
went to law in the 18th century and after-
wards.
* # * #
The reason was that the second half of the
previous century had witnessed the passing
of the venal Judge—personified by monsters
such as Jeffreys and .Scroggs —and the
appearance on the Bench of a long line of
men who, with but few exceptions, were
ready to fight, according to their lights, for
justice against the world. The special need
for juries disappeared with the arrival of
constitutionalism. In the days when the
royal prerogative had a definite meaning,
when it was being used to impose taxation
in the interests of a king’s mistress, or to
rob a king’s enemies in the interests of one
of his friends, the jury system had a de-
finite function. It was the solitary bulwark
the poor had against the extortions of the
rich. It was the only guarantee of freedom
that 80 per cent, of tne nation possessed.
True, it often proved somewhat of a broken
reed. Jeffreys got over 800 convictions in
the “Bloody Assizes” —the inoffensive vic-
tims being sold overseas as slaves—and his
fortune was founded largely on blackmail
paid by innocent men of means who feared
to face a jury in his court. Nevertheless
there were occasions when juries stubbornly
vindicated justice in the casie of the humblest,
and, in others, such as the trial of the seven
bishops, where they stood out for a great
national principle. By the actions of these
staunch citizens impulses were given to the
growing spirit of freedom, and the moral
effect on the nation was great otherwise.
But the repository of power is no longer a
sovereign ruling by divine _ right through
Judges who have been appodnted by himself
and are his creatures to the extent that their
fortunes depend on his favor. Our Judges
are appointed by democratically-elected Par-
liaments, and they hold their offices only
quamdiu se bene gesserint. Juries are no
longer in opposition. They are no
longer required to stand up for the poor and
the obscure against a Bench which repre-
sents the rich and the powerful. A modern
Bench is as independent of social, financial
and political influences as any human insti-
tution can be.
* * *
The jury has thus got back to its embryonic
function—at any rate, so far as civil suits
are concerned —of sitting as a body of asses-
sors. With these main differences: that,
whereas the knights found on matters within
their own knowledge, our jurors find on the
evidence of witnesses, and that, whereas the
knights were financially independent, few
modern jurors are. Juries provide unim-
peachable verdicts, in the briefest space of
time, where no malign influences become
active. But in almost every matter involv-
ing a large sum of money, or a party who
has plenty of money, the verdict tends to
be questionable, not to say scandalous. In
a recent big divorce suit, for example, a
co-re. caused it to be known unofficially that
he “had £30,000 to prove his innocence.” It
is hardly necessary to mention that he proved
it. The truth is, the Jury Acts of Australia,
based as they are on the British Act, could
not be more favorable to the interests of
the rich if the I’ich had been given the pri-
vilege of drafting them. They begin by
exempting from service a large proportion
of the intelligentsia of the nation. There
are no urgent reasons why members of Par-
liament or physicians or surgeons or lawyers
or schoolmasters or mine-managers or clergy-
men should be exempted, and there are, at
least, two excellent reasons why they should
be made to serve: their training tends to
render them superior as weighers of evidence
to the petty traders and others who at pre-
sent preponderate even on special juries,
and, other things equal, they should be harder
to square. The presence of ignorant men on
juries has given rise to the type of counsel
who strings out trials to an unconscionable
length. And here, of course, the rich man
scores again. He is in a position to smile
at the interminable strings of questions that
lead nowhere; the insincere “objections” and
the bogus arguments on them ; the address
in which anything resembling a point is made
20 or 30 times. To the poor litigant legal
warfare on such a scale means ruin, even
if he wins, and, in consequence, thousands
forego their rights every year for the simple
reason that they cannot afford to assert them.
And over almost every trial, civil or criminal,
with which the rich are identified, hovers the
maleficent figure of the professional jury-
squarer.
* * * *
It may be that public opinion is not yet
prepared for the total abolition of juries,
though every big suit helps the cause. But
the public is, anyhow, ready and eager to
see the system improved. Apart from pos-
sible modifications of the rule demanding
unanimity among the 12 in order to convict
in criminal cases, three reforms suggest them-
selves. In the first place, juries ought to
be drawn from the most responsible classes
in the community. Archbishops should be
chosen in preference to indigent lay preach-
ers, men of the Delprat and Sam Hordern
type rather than their casual laborers. The
principle that it is dangerous for juries to
be in a position to be approached is recog-
nised by the fact that they are segregated
under particular circumstances. If the jury-
squarer is ever to be put right out of the
business they will have to be segregated from
the beginning to the end of all trials. This
hardship should not be intolerable to public-
spirited citizens who are capable of realising
the magnitude of the issue at stake. A.nd
it would materially help to bring about the
third needed reform, namely, the discourage-
ment of the habitual stringer-out of cases.
Trials running into weeks, where there is
no valid reason why they should have lasted
more than two or three days, are scandals
now: they would become intolerable imme-
diately the more articulate section of the
community began to be prejudiced by them.
But, in any case, the eventual fate of the
old system is foreshadowed. There are no
juries in equity, probate, bankruptcy or the
arbitration courts; they are the exception
in divorce (except, as already stated, where
the parties are rich), and they are rarely in
evidence in the district courts, while the
police courts get along without them alto-
gether. Mammon, who is king at the
moment, has found a certain means of sway-
ing juries just as the king did in the epoch
when kings were absolute. Juries will only
be needed again, in the interests of justice
and liberty, when the political bosses who
appear to be our kings in embryo find a
means of controlling the Judges.
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.
“I cannot have one punishment for a man
with seven children and another for a man
with two,” said Mr. Justice Chapman, of
the Maoriland Bench, when counsel men-
tioned the seven children in extenuation.
The prisoner was charged with defalcations
amounting to £4OOO, and had pleaded guilty;
he was sentenced to four years’ imprison-#
ment with hard labor.
Now, I do not discuss this sentence. Its
justice is a matter of opinion. The circum-
stances in the case were that the accused
was in receipt of a salary of £450 per
annum, that he began betting, and gradu-
ally beeame more and more involved with
the bookies. I am concerned solely with the
statement of Chapman, J., and whether it
be true or not. As far as this Judge is con-
cerned, lam sure that it is; he cannot have
punishments varying with a man’s- family
responsibilities. But as far as other Judges
are concerned, I am equally certain that it
is not true. That justice, as fine as any in
the world, is administered in M.L. cannot be
denied. Nevertheless, uniformity of justice,
if it was ever an actuality, is non-existent
now. This is not attributable to the Judges
themselves, but to the system that obtains.
Each Judge must participate in the criminal
work of the country, even though his tem-
perament or viewpoint renders him totally
unfitted for it; and in consequence we find men
charged with similar offences or with offences
performed under similar circumstances
receiving dissimilar periods of punishment.
I hold no brief for the criminal. I believe
that if he sins against society he should not
be allowed to go scot-free. Yet he is at
least entitled to demand that the severity of
his punishment shall not depend upon the
toss of a coin. And that is the state of
affairs at the present time in M.L.; and I
believe it is largely so also in Australia.
How a prisoner will fare depends on his good
luck in coming before one Judge, or his bad
luck in coming before another.
To go from the general to the particular,
a year or so back another man was charged
with defalcations amounting to over £4OOO.
The facts were almost the same as those of
the instance I have mentioned, except that
in this other case various individuals came
forward and spoke of the prisoner’s associa-
tion with different sports and with various
patriotic movements. He had meted out to
him by a different Judge three years’ refor-
mative detention—a term which the Prisons
Board has power, contingent on the good
behavior of the prisoner, to reduce to one-
half. At the same time, in another centre,
a young man, 22 years of age, was charged
with, and pleaded guilty to, the crime of
stealing a Savings Bank book and forging
the signature of the owner to a transfer of
the account from Wellington to Whangarei.
Justice John Salmond was on the Bench,
and he sentenced the lad, whose record prior
to this lapse was blameless, to 12 months’
imprisonment with hard labor for each
offence, the terms to run concurrently. The
probation officer submitted a favorable re-
port, but his Honor refused to look at it,
saying that there was no probation officer’s
report until he asked for it. Under the
Crimes Amendment Act (1920), which gives
leave to appeal where the sentence is con-
sidered excessive, the case was re-opened by
the Court of Appeal, and the prisoner was
ordered to come up for sentence if called
upon so to do within a period of three years
—a sentence tantamount to probation for
that time. The decision was taken very
badly by Salmond, J., who behaved in the
petulant manner of a spoilt child; for when
the next man who chanced to be a first
offender came up for sentence before him he
said: “Prisoner, as it is apparently now the
law of this country that every man may
commit one crime with impunity, I have no
option but to commit you to a term of pro-
bation.”
The point may be emphasised by a refer-
ence to the personality of the Judges. To
take only three —Salmond and Adams, Jus-
tices, and Stout, C.J. The first is an emi-
nent scholar and a jurist. He is, above all,
not a man of the world. From student he
became teacher; then from professor he went
to the offices of Attorney-General and Judge.
He is a beautiful legal machine ; but what
qualifications does he possess to inflict sen-
tences? Crime is mainly the product of cir-
cumstance, and unless a Judge has mixed
much with his fellow-men and knows their
ways, he should not be asked to weigh their
acts in the light of some theory of punish-
ment that is entirely his own. The other two
are fanatical on the subject of prohibition.
We should expect that this would bring about


'a similarity of viewpoint; but it has the
opposite effect. Mr. Justice Adams is in-
clined to be exceptionally severe with any
individual whose offence is the result of, or
in any way due to, drunkenness. Chief Jus-
tice Stout, while deploring the vice of exces-
sive drinking, is known to be sympathetic
towards, and deal lightly with, such an indi-
vidual, because he believes—-and has so stated
his belief—that any man under the influence
of liquor is incapable of knowing what he
is doing and should be judged accordingly.
Salmond, J., says that he should be pun-
ished for the consequences of the act itself;
Adams, J., that anyone who gets drunk de-
serves all he gets; Stout, C. J., that he
should receive some sentence, although he is
often more to be pitied than blamed.
What is to be done? In Maoriland there
are 10 active Judges. One is restricted to
the matters that come before the Court of
Arbitration; the other nine are. engaged in
both civil and criminal causes. There are
19 Supreme Courts to be visited, four times
a year, as well as the sittings of the Court
of. Appeal. One Judge could not do all the
criminal work at these sessions, but, possibly,
three or four could. They should. They
should come from the ranks of men who have
shown at the Bar some aptitude for
criminal law, or, at any rate, have
shown that they know and understand their
fellows, and what strange creatures men are.
Such a condition of things would have a
further and more vital result than that of
merely being, fairer to the criminal
himself. It would reduce crime. Under
the present arrangement, the offender
who gets off with a comparatively light sen-
tence receives the congratulation of his com-
panions in evil-doing, and has a direct induce-
ment to err again; but the man who faces
a hard, unsympathetic Judge and receives
a sentence disproportionate with the crime
he has committed, or disproportionate with
other sentences for similar crimes, goes into
prison with a grievance against justice, and
comes out of prison with a hatred of it—
a hatred that he is liable to vent upon society
at his earliest opportunity.
A M.L. BARRISTER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Exit—the Boss.
Fob some years past Queensland workers
have been induced to believe that every em-
ployer is a ravening wolf and the sooner the
breed was got rid of the better. Side by
side with this propaganda taxation has been
so piled up on the backs of employers that
many of them find it pays better to get out
of the “boss” industry, put their savings into
Government bonds and live unworried on the
proceeds, leaving it to others to take the risk
of strikes, confiscatory taxation, impossible
Arbitration awards and similar calamities.
Much has been said about the vast increase
in the number of unemployed in Queensland,
and a variety of causes have been assigned
for the phenomenon ; but there is no obscu-
rity about it—the plain, obvious truth is that
men with money in Queensland mostly de-
cline to become employers, and employers
get out of the business when they can. The
Labor and Industrial branch of' the Com-
monwealth Bureau of Statistics gives this
interesting tabulated statement for Queens-
land
1911. 1921.
Employers.. .. .. .. 26,909 19,570
Receiving wages and salaries.. 182,707 195,606
Unemployed . . . . . . 9,060 33,348
The statement indicates that in the 10 years
no fewer than 7339 employers found it paid
them best to give up employing their fellow-
Queenslanders, and to lie back and live on
their capital or their interest coupons, and
leave to others the privilege of toiling for
profits (or losses) and be denounced as ex-
ploiters, leeches and “commercial bucca-
neers.” Assuming that they employed only
on an average three men apiece, this would
account for some 21,000 out of the total of
33,348 unemployed given in the table. Cer-
tain Queensland Ministers are disputing the
accuracy of the official figures, which indi-
cate that the wealthy northern State has
nearly four times as many out-of-works as
if had 10 years ago; but the enormous
amount admittedly spent in doles and out-
door relief is most ample corroboration of
the correctness of the statistics. In the last
year of the Denham regime it was found
necessary to spend only £7300 on relief; in
the year 1921-22 no less than £177,000 was
handed out. If this gigantic increase in
dole-expenditure is not caused by the in-
crease in the number of the unemployed, will
Premier Theodore or his Ministerial hench-
men tell us what is the cause ? Surely. £5OO
a day is not given to workers who draw the
basic wage! The late Billy Browne, one-
time leader of the Babor party, and later
Minister for Mines, used to say that the fre-
quency of unemployment was the real test by
which a Government ought to be tried, and
that under a Labor Administration the thing
would probably disappear altogether. Little
did Browne imagine that under a
Labor Administration the evil would be mul-
tiplied, and that the beloved socialistic State
of his dreams would become a wholesale
charity-shop and an endless breeder of para-
sites.
Australia’s Reward.
The people of the United Kingdom have
short memories for other things than their
ex-soldiers, and the attitude of the Bonar
Law Government towards the Australian
meat industry is a case in point. Ten years
ago, when Britain was importing less than
a third of its meat supplies, the fact was
pretty generally recognised in London that
Australia and Maoriland alone stood between
Smithfield and the U.S. Meat Trust. Ten
years ago a section of the British pubi c
understood that to be dependent on a for-
eigner for meat or wheat was much the same
as being dependent on a foreign army or
navy. The world war came and, it might
be thought, drove home once and for all
the lesson that unqualified freetrade in food
is the maddest risk for a country in Britain’s
position. When Kennedy Jones took
charge of the food problem in the summer
of 1917 the LT.K. was on the edge of famine.
The Ilorses (Rationing) Order failed to give
adequate results, and when, by a series of
chances, relief arrived, the Government was
discussing the slaughter of every animal that
consumed cereals. Throughout this crisis,
when the winning of the war depended just
as much on meat as on men, Australasia
supplied both; and the first it supplied at a
third of the price asked by the Argentine.
The difference between Australia and M.L. on
the one hand and Argentina on the other
was that, _ 10 years ago, when the move made
by the U.S. Meat Trust for the control of
the British market became apparent, the
two former countries resisted and the latter
yielded. There is plenty of British capital
in Argentina, of course, but it is Chicago-
controlled capital, as was shown during the
late war. Delisle Burns says in his “In-
ternational Politics”:—
The Allied Governments agreed to purchase meat
supplies together and not in competition, and they
met with what was practically only one seller. The
seller cvas the Big Five, who could charge almost
any price and could force the live-stock producers
to take anything. The actual result was apparently
a profit of about 100 per cent, in the year 1917.
The U.K. now imports half its meat supply,
and the indications are that the figure will
soon be two-thirds and the sellers wholly
American. The justification of the Bonab
Law Government is that the people of Bri-
tain are heavily taxed, and must have cheap
food. The answer of Australia and M.L.
might well be that such food is only as
cheap as it is because they still hold the
Big Five at bay. And it is not merely cheap
meat that is in issue. The Meat Trust which,
according to the 1918 report of the Fed-
eral (IJ.S.) Trade Commission on the meat-
packing industry, controls 574 companies un-
connected with meat, and has representation
on 956 directorates, aspires to control the
whole of the world’s foodstuffs. Once it
even approaches that goal the Briton wall
be in the position of having sacrificed his
national security and independence without
even the satisfaction of achieving cheap food
in return. The farthing per pound subsidy
given to the Australian cattle industry by the
Federal Government may tide primary pro-
ducers over their immediate difficulties, but
the basic requirement is propaganda de-
signed to satisfy the British public of what
is in progress. The Meat Trust failed to
beat Australasia in this part of the world,
but with the help of the Freetrade insanity
it appears to have bright prospects of suc-
ceeding in England.
•
Drought Insurance.
The Dooley Government conceived the N.
S. Wales scheme of drought insurance in
the bright young days when the Dooleys
were shifting universes in their mind's eye.
Nothing was done, of course, but the pro-
ject was bequeathed to Fuller, who is
urged to take it up. In fact, the Fuller
Government is partly committed to action
of some sort, but then it is partly committed
to many things. N. S. Wales has 37 mil-
lion sheep and million cattle, and in
very dry seasons the loss, suffering and de-
terioration are alarming. Therefore, it is.
suggested that the graziers and the Gov-
ernment should contribute £1,000,000 a year
(half each) for five years, and accumulate
£5,000,000 worth of fodder if drought doesn’t
eat it up in the interval. When drought
does eat it up the supply will, presumably,
be renewed. There would be no permanent
good in the enterprise if it wmsn’t. The
little lot is to be stored in suitable and handy
places, as wheat w T as stored during some of
the war years, when mice and other nuis-
ances got at it, and when the accounts be-
came mixed. Nothing is said about storing
w’ater. There is no guarantee that the
drought will come at the right places, for
the stores can’t be everywhere; and the drag-
ging of fodder from agricultural districts to
pastoral ones along the needlessly long and
crooked railways, where there are railways,
looks something of a contract, and the drag-
ging of it, for storage or distribution, along
the roads where the coastal lines and the
tableland lines don’t connect looks some-
thing more than a contract. Perhaps if
every port worth the name was joined by
rail to its hinterland, much fresh fodder
might plod most of its journey cheaply by
tramp steamer; but such connections are
only talked about —like the Binnaway-
Werris Creek railway that would a
short alternative track by which stock might
get to fodder or fodder get to stock. but
which is disliked because it would divert
some trade from Sydney. One way and an- '
other a fair amount of indirect drought, in-
surance might be done even with £5,000,000;
and it is doubtful whether any other form
of national drought insurance will be of
much value. It is needless to say
that the people who propose fodder
depots drag in the example of Joseph
in Egypt. The tale would be incomplete
without him. But the patriarch had
a small country to worry about, for habit-
able Egypt is less than half the area of Tas-
mania; and his concern was mostly with .
human beings who could walk or boat to the .
scene of rations.
•
The Marriage Contract. *
Melbourne Age called on the Bruce-PagS -
Government in a recent article to get to work
on a uniform divorce law, making the point
that “an offending husband who desires to
deny his wife her freedom has only to trans-
fer her home from one State to another m
order to disqualify her claim for redress.”
This, however, is a relatively minor objec-
tion to the system. A country which has
lax divorce laws in one State and stringent
ones in another is on the way to
provide itself with a Reno. In every
part of the world certain States or provinces
or districts stand out for the old ways—a
Commonwealth example is South Aus. —and
it is not right that they should be penalised
for their principles. Gresham’s Law applies
here as in other cases. The bad moral money
must always beat the good. Even so m ser-
able a place as Reno is enabled to boom,
financially, by the unique facilities it offers
incompatibles. Tasmania has done well out
of Tattersall’s. and any State in the Com-
monwealth would profit, in the material
sense, if it decided to outb’d its neighbor
in the quick-divorce line. A Federal divorce
law would do more than make Australia
one for domiciliary purposes: it would tend
to steady the nation in the sectional advances
it is making towards the goal recently pro-
posed for Germany—an arrangement under
which mere distaste on the part of husband
or wife shall constitute grounds for full re-
lief. The natural corollary of a standard-
lsed divorce law is a standardised marriage
law, and tlie two subjects m.ght conveniently
be discussed and dealt with together. Mar-
riage, which the Law recognises in various
ways as a purely civil contract —in the penal-
ties it allows for breach of promise, f .r ex-
ample—requires to be taken out of the hands
of the churches altogether. The only legal
marriage would then be the State marriage.
Any church could afterwards give the happy
pair its blessing—and the original church
marriage was no more than that. The
churches might also be allowed to teach that
failing their blessing Providence would not
recognise the contract. In British communi-
ties the traditionally mysterious ways of
Providence are questions upon which anyone
is at liberty to. express what opinions he
likes: the issue is between him and Heaven.
But any citizen who publicly denied the
validity of the State ceremony would ipso
facto become liable to an action for damages
as a libeller or slanderer, the issue here be»ng
between him and the State. These are mat-
ters on which the Commonwealth and the
States ought to come to an agreement soon.
That is to say, before vested interests grow
up around our conflicting divorce laws, and
before sectaries are able to sway public
opinion in favor of the existing marriage
laws which, by their illogicality and confu-
sion and general untidiness, play into the
hands of sectarianism.
A Pan-Pacific Pow-wow.
It was reported the other day from Moscow,
the place where the “advanced” Australian
trade-union secretary goes to get his instruc-
tions, that “the Third Internationale will
send eight delegates to the conference of all
the peoples of the Pacific which the Austra-
lian Communisf party is arranging.” This is
the conference that was decided upon by
the so-called All-Australian Congress of
Trade Unions—the same that came out
strong on the need for “taking and holding
the means of production by revolutionary
action”—and concerning which Bob Ross,
himself a delegate, supplied the following in-
formation to The Bulletin, in reply to
some questions about the White Australia
policy:—
Congress proposed that Australian Labor take the
initiative in convening a pan-Pacific Congress of the
Labor movement. At it I assume that the move-
ment will declare a common policy on inter-racial
relationships affecting tariffs, immigration and emi-
gration, indentured and cheap labor, color, etc
Among “the new internationalist Laborites” keen
controversy rages round the White Australia policy,
and as an outcome anything is possible.
The conference, in short, is to declare, among
other things, whether Australia should be
allowed to have a tariff, an Immigration
Restriction Act, an army, a navy and an
air force. And if the intention to invite
“all the peoples of the Pacific” is carried
out, the Australian, Canadian and U.S. dele-
gates will be' lost in the multitude of
gentlemen from China, Japan, Siberia,
Siam, the Philippines, Borneo, Celebes,
Dutch New Guinea, Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua. Costa Rica,
Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile.
Isn’t it nearly time the Australian worker
realised what is being done in his name?
Isn’t it nearly time he woke up and saw that
he is being double-harnessed with the cheap
colored man, whose standard of living is so
low that he would regard himself as well paid
if he got one-sixth of the Australian white
man’s wage? The double-harnessing means
many other things—some of them shocking
things. But this one consideration ought to
be enough for the Australian worker to go
on with.

A Scheme of Things that Might be
Sorrier.
After a visit of inspection :
I have just returned from a visit to an Australian
factory, where, in normal times, a good man can
make from £8 to £l2 a week, and a first-class hand
has been known to take out £l7 for 48 hours’ toil.
Piece-workers, of course. The unscientific brutality of
the levelling-down system is not for the workers in
that mill. Levelling-down is a fine thing for the
inefficient and the loafer, but you must pay a superior
man according to his superiority. If you don’t he
naturally tends to become an indolent and rebellious
employee, who takes his demoralising grievance into
the home circle and feeds it fat against the kind of
employer who insists on his giving 25 p.c. better
results than the fellow alongside who gets the same
pay—or the sort that, for the sake of peace with the
greatest number, acquiesces in Society and himself
being robbed of the extra amount of work which the
man with the grudge is qualified to give, while de-
priving the latter of the opportunity of earning
the equivalent in money. Rightly handled, the best
type of skilled worker would be the firmest supporter
of the system of payment according to merit. But,
thanks to the cowardice or stupidity of the worst
class of employer, he is sometimes its bitterest enemy.
What an interesting fellow the Australian wage-
earner is! He has his faults, the worst of Which is
his odd craze for horse-gambling, but take him for
all in all there is no better anywhere. I have
studied him in war and in peace, at work and at
play, and admire him as greatly as I abominate the
politics which are being foisted on him. How
idiotic is the belief of the scatter-brained Labor-
socialist that this vigorous and self-reliant type can
be made a collectivist by compulsion! All the
instincts he has inherited from his English, Scotch
and Irish ancestors rebel against the French socialism
which has been tried on Australia with evil conse-
quences during the last 25 years, and against the
German socialism, with Tartar trimmings, which is
the fashion at the moment. That is one of the reasons
why Government ownership has been a failure. Not
that the worker blindly accepts the present economic
system. On the contrary, he bitterly resents the
insecurity of his position under it. Arbitration and
Factory Acts have assured him of a living wage,
of reasonable hours of labor, of decent working
conditions; but he is still insufficiently protected
against the caprices or ingratitude of employers and
the hardships that may be imposed on him or his
dependants by sickness or death. Though he toil
for the same boss for 40 years he acquires no vested
interest—no industrial equivalent of goodwill, tenant-
right, equity of redemption or title by adverse
possession—in his job. These are legitimate griev-
ances, They could be remedied to a large extent by
a great national scheme of insurance against
unemployment, sickness, accident, old age and death.
There are other ways in which the competitive
system might be humanised without impairing its
elasticity or destroying the incentive to excel. But.
its austerities and asperities notwithstanding, the
average worker infinitely prefers it to the bureau-
cratic sort of socialism, with its maddening meddlin'*
in every department of life, and to the happy conn
bination of robbery, murder, inefficiency and famine
known as Communism.
In the domain of politics there is only one prin-
ciple that matters to the Australian toiler, and it
is the White Australia principle. It is all-in-all to
him and to all good Australians. If White Australia
goes, everything goes. This was the attitude of the
old Labor party and was one of the sources of its
strength. But the so-called Labor party which has
come in since the war, and which is inspired on
the one hand by the Russian Bolshevists, who boast
of “rousing the Oriental races against Western
Imperialism,’’ and on the other by the British Labor-
socialists, one of whose leaders is a Parsee, and who
are strong for the brotherhood of man, is com-
mitted to disarmament and internationalism. This
moonshine is incompatible with the hard-fisted White
Australia policy, and, pushed to Tts logical conclusion,
would be fatal to it. In the never-ending succession
of squabbles between the industrials and the poli-
ticals, Macdonell House and the Labor Council, the
Reds and Pinks, caucus and executive, Dooley and
McGikr, the fact hasn’t soaked into the worker’s
brain. When it'does the so-called Labor party will
wonder whether a bomb did the business or a thunder-
bolt.
Robbery in Theory anti Practice.
Let another name be inscribed on the roll
of industrial martyrs—that of Alfred
Charles Callahan, colloquially known as
“Bull.” Callahan is the wage-slave who
got £520 from the Great Boulder mine by
what the minions of capitalism call robbery
with violence, and who explained in the
oppressor’s vile dock that he did it to
advance the socialistic cause. Re-tried in
Perth after a Kalgoorlie jury had disagreed,
he repeated the defence of “propaganda by
deed,” and maintained that the oppressor had
vowed liis destruction ever since he took part
in the anti-conscription campaign. Also (in
the words of one of the Piute prints)
Callahan went into the box and elaborated his
scheme of propaganda. He had often discussed such
measures, he said, with other students of economics
and philosophy.
The Crown Prosecutor : Are there many of them
about Kalgoorlie and Boulder ‘i •
Accused : They are gradually becoming enlightened.
In reply to a further question Callahan said Tie
could not give an idea of the actual number of en-
lightened industrialists on the goldfields.
Apparently these robust thinkers are suffici-
ently numerous to have made some impres-
sion on the class from which Kalgoorlie
jurymen are drawn. But, unfortunately for
their fellow-student, their influence has not
extended to Perth. In that haunt of the
exploiter, Comrade Callahan was delivered
over to the vengeance of a ruthless system.
A bourgeois jury found him guilty and a
plutocratic Judge said that it was in his
power to reward the “propagandist by deed”
with life imprisonment and a flogging. When
last seen by the sturdy fellows who believe
in socialism with the lid off, “Bull” was on
his way to a capitalistic dungeon, there to be
confined for seven years, less the usual re-
missions. Yet, after all, he only practised
in an individual case.what “advanced” trade-
union leaders preach for general application.
If he had contented himself with going to
trade-union conferences and voting for rob-
bery in the mass, “by the workers uniting
in one class-conscious organisation to take
and hold the means of production by revo-
lutionary action,” he might have got into
Parliament. But he formed himself into a
class-conscious organisation of one, and took
and held the Great Boulder’s £520 by revolu-
tionary action ; so he gets into gaol. And no
doubt the white-sou Ted advocates of univer-
sal theft will virtuously repudiate him.
Ammunition Supplied Free.
In a Sydney suburb last week there was talk
of a hotel license being transferred, to the
annoyance of those residents who either do
not use hotels or who get all the drink they
require in the city. A parson proceeded to
argue that if the section that was moving
to have the license transferred in a perfectly
legal manner was successful, the only thing
for the opposition to do would be to organise
a branch of the Ku Klux Klan and “terrorise
the advocates of Booze into a more seemly
frame of mind.” Whenever the Italian Fas-
cists are reported as having flogged a social-
ist or dosed a socialist’s mother with oil.
the folks who talk fondly of Ivu Klux Klan
as a substitute for the licensing laws clamor
for the application of Fascist methods to
their political opponents. . Last month two
self-styled envoys from the non-existent Irish
republic ari’ived in Australia. Their meet-
ings have been ridiculous failures. They
have collected practically no money. They
have been either repudiated or ignored by
every notable Irishman in Australia with
the inevitable solitary exception. Yet a few
days ago a number of Sydney Nationalists
who live politically, and to a great extent
economically, on anti-Irishism, summoned a
Town Hall meeting to discuss the case of
the futile pair. The nominal object of the
gathering was to inculcate loyalty; consoli-
date the Empire; strengthen the monarchy.
The actual effect can only be to promote
dissension by perpetuating the Orange and
Green insanity which has twice threatened
Britain with revolution during the last 10
years, and to provide the local Bolsheviks
with telling arguments concerning the blind
intolerance of monarchists and clericals. The
question is worth considering: How much
of the hatred, malice and uneharitableness
whmh afflict us is due to the hatred, malice
and uncharitableness which professed oppo-
nents of those things put into their own
campaigns?
Knighthoods for Briggs and Boggs.
A subject on which Victoria proposes to
prod its gradual Premier when lie returns
from the marble halls of Europe is that of
its dilapidated and insufficient State schools.
The number of schools hasn’t decreased since
the year before the war; in fact, N. S. Wales,
under Holman, Storey and Dooley, is the
only State which shows that disgraceful
phenomenon. But nearly everything else that
shouldn’t happen lias happened. The high
cost of construction is ascribed as a sufficient
reason why the overcrowded, insanitary, out-
of-date academy must last a while longer.
The answer is that the estimates should be
cut as low as they can go without sacrificing
results, and when they can go no lower the
schools should be built —enough schools, big
enough schools to leave a margin for the
future, and schools that are good inside and
not ugly outside. Victoria could add 7s. per

render the buying and selling to business specialists,
as Parliamentary voters we do not make that sur-
render ; nor do we demand business ability in our
representatives, for as yet we have not grasped that
the rules governing the successful management of a
commercial enterprise govern also the largest enter-
prise, the State. And to get efficient government we
must surrender the power of the purse to expert
directors. That is, we surrender a right we do not
know how to use and are not learning to use, to
have freedom in matters we can better understand.
As there will be no tarts in such a political pantry—
for Parliaments under the new conditions could only
spend with the experts’ sanction —different factors
to those now operating would control elections.
But while a biologist may say what a people ought
to do, and it may have some minute influence, he
assumes that necessities shape the future of life;
and as nationally we have grown careless, so only
a national necessity will spur us collectively to the
remedy.
The new item that I think is here added to this
much debated question is the increasing devolution
of the economic sense in the majority under modern
social conditions and its increased evolution in a
minority. To test this inference, look about; inquire
of I key Mo and he will tell you that his most
esteemed clients —those who have little in their
pockets after he has met them —are educated officials
in well-paid responsible positions. In some large
departments 90 p.c. of the salaries are spent before
they are due. These habitual borrowers are educated ;
but they know nothing of practical economies. The
operation of this law of divergence accounts for
many things, explaining repeated disappointments;
for obviously, if a natural law, it applies to our
other faculties. In result: “No one person or section
of society is to have all Nature’s cakes and ale."
«
A certain monotony attaches to the almost
daily picture of some new or projected 10- or
12-storey building, and the attached remarks
head per annum (over £550,000 a year) to
its taxes, and still be the least burdened of
the States. If it did that for, say, five years,
or ten, if necessary, it might make itself a
model schoolmaster for the world. The child
really calls for some consideration.
The old man sells the child’s in-
heritance in the public estate and be-
queaths him a prize debt as a substi-
tute, and that alone gives him a claim. An
unaccountable thing is that Briggs, the local
rich man, in his desire to insure his soul
against fire, or to stand for Parliament, or
to advertise himself generally, doesn’t habitu-
ally present his neighborhood with a first-
class State school which will completely
eclipse that built by Boggs, the rich man in
the next township, and adorn the structure
with a brass plate setting forth his name and
pedigree. It would be a beneficent vanity,
and if Briggs got in early and built several
schools he could hardly avoid a knighthood
for setting such a good example. In fact,
so far as Victoria is concerned, and much
more so where N. S. Wales is concerned,
there should be superabundant room for
Boggs to earn a knighthood also; for when
certain figures for 1913 and 1920 (these are
the latest in the annual Federal statistical
volume, and those of Victoria seem to be
really for 1919) are compared the results
are quite surprising:—

The case of N. S. Wales, where old schools
are falling down instead of new ones going
up, and where the crowding is worst, is, of
course, in a category by itself. Perhaps the
last few responsible Ministers ought to be
hanged. But even the most entertaining
form of execution is no substitute for con-
struction. And in that there is no reason
why Private Enterprise shouldn’t take a
hand, as it does in most other countries.
Unrepresentative Government.
"Bio” considers the basis of government:—
The Bulletin (22/3/’23) notes the evolution,
followed by devolution, of our Parliamentary gov-'
eminent, and its incidental repeating for the
umptieth time of a like happening in past democ-
racies. The suggested remedy is more Parliaments,
because while small and juvenile they are usually
efficient. But surely this is no more than a pallia-
tive ; for each young governing body in due course
grows up. We must recognise a new factor in
modern communities requiring a new departure in
our Constitution to meet it. The new factor is
Modern Finance, and the Wild Cat must be pen-
weary of pointing out that, even in the ease of
small commercial companies, such finance requires
trained experts; honesty and good intentions do
not suffice, as they are not sufficient in medicine,
surgery or even domestic cookery.
In response to this modern factor certain indi-
viduals have evolved with an aptitude to under-
stand and, given a business or accountant’s train-
ing, an aptitude to control it, just as the natu-
rally musical can become trained musicians. But
as we have not all got a musical ear, and are not
likely to acquire one, so many of us lack a keen
financial faculty and are not likely to gain it.
Most of us have agreed to have our musical enter-
tainments controlled by experts, resigning our youth-
ful strivings with the fiddle or the mouth-organ;
and it is time we grew up to the realisation that
our financial perceptions may be equally primitive
and equally distressing to otheT3 if exercised.
The biological justification for the mistakes of
democracies is that by errors they learn, and that
knowledge is only gained by experience; so that
only by the pains of badly governing themselves will
the proletary learn good governing. Since that
explanation was found for the disappointments of
democracies, biologists have learned more of natural
law. It is true that knowledge in the species is only
gained, so far as we know, by experience; but it
is also true that the more evolved the species in a
social community, the more the specialising of its
different sections. Robinson Crusoe did everything
for himself in a clumsy, tedious way. With com-
panions, labor was shortened, results were better.
In degree this advantage of specialising is acknow-
ledged by Parliaments, which subordinate many of
their projects to the fiat of the engineer, surveyor or
medical authority; but they have so far, except by
appointing committees of their own kind, not recog-
nised that they are collectively as incompetent to
handle finance as they are to medically handle an
epidemic. And not only are they incompetent and
likely, to remain so, but those they' represent—the
mass of electors —are in like case. For modern
occupations tend less than primitive occupations 1o
evolve a general financial sense. Seeking thrift and
economy as a prevailing trait, we go to a primitive
people, the peasants of France, Germany and Scot-

about "the reconstruction of Sydney.” Cer-
tainly a great deal is being done, for during
last year 8584 new buildings were run up in
the city and suburbs (also 6001 were more or
less reconstructed) against only 4620 that
were put up in all the other municipalities
of N. S. Wales —144 of them. In fact, apart
from the County of Cumberland and New-
castle and suburbs, there wasn’t so much
spent on build ng in the whole State as was
laid out in Randwick and Waverley. But the
city isn’t so much being reconstructed as
having tall lighthouses dabbed on it here
and there; and the removal of some of them
in the future for street-widening purposes
will be quite a job. So far as active recon-
struction is concerned it consists for the
moment mainly of the refusal of the Govern-
ment to get its post office out of the way
of the William-street improvements ; the de-
cision that nothing can be done to complete
Elizabeth-street and cut out the angle wh ch
has caused a steady stream of curses since
the first tram struggled round it 41 years
ago; a similar decision about Martin-place,
which scheme seems to have lost its attrac-
tions now that it doesn’t include the employ-
ment of anyone in particular; and the mon-
strous ditch in Hyde Park. Lord May'r
Gilpin says Sydney is to have 1,700.000
people inside nine years. Other enthusiasts
say that another decade will see it the big
city of the hemisphere, and that it has a
mission to compete with New York for sky*
scrapers. New York, planted between a
State with 420 people per square mile and
one with 220, may feel squeezed and breath-
less ; but why Sydney should feel like that
with only seven humans to the m.le in N. S.
Wales isn’t obvious. An even more aston-
ishing thing is that, in the circumstances,
citizens should feel any pride in the sky-
scraping.
Australia’s own flowery Garden has
reached Australia from Russia, the place
where he made a sensation with the news
that he and 1000 other Communists ran the
Labor movement of this Commonwealth and
made the Labor policy. He was reassuring
but vague:—
Russia was decidedly on the upward grade. She had
been on a very bad rock, but now, after getting on
a firm foundation, was building slowly but surely.
The men at the head of affairs were the smartest and
ablest men he had met throughout his travels....
Every Soviet man knew his business, understanding
it from A to Z.
Why these super-men who embraced Garden
let a crop shortage—the sort of thing we
have in Australia every few years—-get them
down and worry them so badly was not. ex-
plained. On the other hand, Britain didn’t
embrace Garden and doesn’t practise his doc-
trines, so there is no good in it: —
Throughout the industrial centres of Great Britain
the position was appalling. The average Australian
worker could not possibly have any conception of the
actual conditions prevailing among the people over
there. It was no wonder that they were looking for a
way of escape. That was why the great majority
had decided to go to a new country.
England especially, having 050 inhabitants
to the square mile against 24 per square mile
in Russia, certainly wears an overcrowded
expression. Still," people don’t talk of
“famine” there, nor of 20,000,000 people hav-
ing died thereof, nor of 30,000 doctors and
nurses having perished last year in the
hunger districts through hardships and epi-
demies; and no huge Yankee and other organ-
isations have been feeding millions of the
people. Also Britain pa.d off a heap of Avar
debt last year, wk.le Russia still had much of
its population on the foreign charity-list.
Further, the Cold Country, whatever its con-
dition, still lends Australia a great deal of
money, and there have been recent times when
some of Garden’s best friends might have
had an empty feeling had not the Old Man’s
loan come along. As for Garden’s assurance
that at least 21,388,766 people are leaving
Great Britain in despair (that represents a
bare majority of. the population of Britain, and
Garden claimed the great majority)—well,
the ex-parson is invited to say if, reviewing
the statement, he doesn’t feel rather like a
roaring ass seeking thistles to devour.
“Kniqhty” : The settlement of people on the
land will continue to be a disastrous business
for the country until the ciiy person who
mostly runs the political show gets it out of
his head that mere brawn can make a
farmer. Take, for example, my two neigh-
bors —call them Brown and Smith. Both
have living areas of excellent wheat land,
and both had a fair start. Brown, big and
muscular, worked for farmers all h.s life
until drawing his own block three years ago.
Experienced and physically sound, he should
have had a fair prospect of success. Yet,
>after three years, his farm presents a sorry
picture—fences and gates in disrepair; in-
sufficient buildings and yards; poor
machinery; no provision against drought;
and, to crown all, a neavy mortgage: these
represent the sum-total of Brown s endea-
vors. Smith four years ago was a mechanic
in Sydney. He had never been on the
land, and was totally inexperienced. net
what a contrast to Brown’s failure does he
present! His farm bears the unmistakable
stamp of methodical work and of prosperity.
Well-built and adequate sheds, all necessary
machinery and well-cleared land proclaim
Smith the successful settler. Why the vast
difference? Simplv because Brown with
all his experience doesn’t possess the neces-
sary brains and education. These two
settlers are actual cases, known to the writer,
and there are many such. Until those re-
sponsible for settling men on the land realise
that a certain amount of grey matter is
essential for conducting the business ot
farming, the case of Brown will be com-
mon. And harping on the poor devil s
failure won’t mend matters.
John Hain’s send-off to a public benefactor:
F. B. Gotiuue, F. 1.0., retires at the end of the
month from the position of Chemist-in-Chief to the
N. S. Wales Department of Agriculture after 31
years’ service. No man has done this State in par-
ticular, and Australia generally, more yeoman service.
But for his genius the world might never have
heard of the late William Farrer, nor might the
latter have produced the wheats that made him
famous. When Farrer started crossing wheats he
was a layman with little conception of the job he
proposed to do. He set out on wrong premises,
believing that it was the quantity of gluten the
wheat contained that decided its value for flour-
making. Guthrie showed that it was the quality
and not the quantity that was the decisive factor,
and thereby put Farrer on the right track. When
Farrer produced his first crop of experimental wheat
he found himself up against another wall. He could
not get his wheat gristed. No commercial mill
could grist a few ounces. Farrer took mortar and
pestle, crushing the wheat to pulp. This, however,
proved useless for research purposes, as the bran
and pollard could not be separated. Guthrie again
came to the rescue, designing a miniature mill which
ground quantities down to an ounce in exactly the
same way as a commercial mill would grind a ton,
enabling the exact proportions of flour, bran and
pollard to be calculated with unerring accuracy, and
from which not only the quantity and quality of the
gluten could be ascertained, but the exact content
of each of the residues. Thus directed and aided,
Farrer produced hundreds of varieties, of which
over a score survived. Other wheat breeders, includ-
ing those who had the resources of Cambridge Uni-
versity behind them, took from 16 to 19 years to
establish a single variety. When the Guthrie system
became known the problem was solved, and to-day
throughout the wheat-growing countries, especially
the United States and Canada, the name of Guthrie
is remembered with gratitude as that of the man
who made wheat crossing, once a most difficult
business, a matter of every-day convenience.
The assistance given to Farrer is but a small
portion of the valuable service rendered by this
gifted, tireless worker. His researches have changed
the whole basis of N. S. Wales agriculture and
placed it on a scientific basis. In addition to
creating the Chemistry side of the Agricultural
Department, Mr. Guthrie was Acting-Professor of
Pure Chemistry at Sydney University, and lectured
on Applied Chemistry for many years. He has
been still more years a member of the Council of
the Agricultural Society. He was president and
hon. see. of the Royal Society. He was president and
councillor of the Australian Chemical Institute, and
rendered valuable services on the National Research
Institute and the Association for the Advancement
of Science.
It has been a busy life, and every working moment
of it devoted to the public good and the service of
his country. The amount of work turned out has
been stupendous. And, as usual with the scientist
in the public service, his emoluments have been
shockingly inadequate. It is not yet too late, how-
ever, for private recognition, and it will be to our
discredit if it is not forthcoming.

“Nugget” : The N. S. Wales Department of
Instruction, faced with a serious shortage of
teachers, is wondering why more men ana
women do not adopt the profession. It should
cease to wonder if it read its own regula-
tions governing entry and subsequent promo-
tion. Take the case of primary teachers
trained in Hereford House. Eighty-five per
cent, of them hold the leaving certificate,
which cost them five years' work at a high
school. They undergo a year’s training m
Sydney, and are then given a probationary
appointment of at least two years on the
salary of an unskilled laborer. _At the end
of this period, if the student is 21, he is
eligible for a provisional classification last-
ing four years, and finally becomes a third-
class assistant earning £5 a week. From the
time a boy leaves the High School he can
count on something like seven years’ work
before he becomes a classified teacher in a
primary school. Five years’ apprenticeship
with a good engineering firm would give the
same youth an earning caspacity of from
£6 to £8 a week, according' to the work
done. Women teachers pass: through the
same course of training, and when finally
classified find themselves ear ping a sahuy
approximately equal to that <)f a shorthand

POLITICAL
POINTS
Theodore’s passionate assurances that his
State isn’t the most-taxed one in the Com-
monwealth fall flat while the Federal Statis-
tician issues figures like these: —
1914-15. 1920-21. Increase.
N. S.. Wales .. £1 11 8 £3 10 8 £1 19 0
Victoria .. .. 148 210 4 158
Queensland .. 182 417 11 3 99
S. Australia •• 168 360 1 19 4
Westralia .. . . 130 217 9 114 9
Tasmania .. .. 1 16 6 367 1 10 1
But there is no mystery about it. Taxes
have followed unprofitable State enterprises
as inevitably as the day the night.
Report has it that London finance will re-
sume business relations with Tneodore if
Queensland sends him back to office with a
good majority. The Bulletin goes further
and says it will resume relations with Theo-
dore even if Queensland sends him to office
with a very small majority. What else can
London finance do? When Ryan and Theo-
dore arrived in 1915, Denham had finished
the job of renewing a bill for nearly
£12,000,000. By amazing luck the new people
hadn’t an lOU falling due for nine years,
save one trifle of a little over a million. But
£13,000,000 falls due next year, all or most
of it in London, where the State owes
£55,000,000. So if J. Bull refused to renew
J. Bull would bring £55,000,000 worth of
his own assets on his own head. Wherefore
he would differ from Samson, who pulled
down somebody else’s temple on top of him
-—not his own temple.
One of the Hayes Government’s worries
in the Speck is connected with the reduction
of portfolios from five to four. The
Economy Board suggested it and the Uppah
Chambati demands it. Hayes can’t sack
himself, and Lee is too strong a debater to
be sent down. Then Blyth, the Lands Min-
ister, is the Cockies’ nominee, and Cocky
support is necessary to the Ministry’s exist-
ence; also, to get rid of one of the others
would infuriate Hobart, which already com-
plains that North Tasmania, with three
Ministers, is over-represented in a Cabinet
of five. Whatever he does Hayes will
offend someone. He may elect to go to the
country on the ground that the Labor leader
with the leonine name is the least dangerous
of the lions in his path.
If word went round that in the service of,
say, the Bank of N. S. Wales a man might
rise to be a branch accountant without
trouble, but that he would find conspiracies
to get rid of him as soon as he reached a
manager’s billet, and that usually the con-
spiracies succeeded, the Bank of N. S. Wales
would soon be in a mess. Two things would
happen; first, the bank would be without
experienced men, and, second, no ambitious
youngster who aimed to reach a top place
and stay there would join that service. Yet
this is exactly the condition the Labor party
has got itself into. No sooner does a man
become a leader than one-fourth of his job
is to fight the enemy in front and three-
fourths of it to stave off the enemy in the
rear; and nine tiipes out of ten the enemy
in the rear gets him. If the Labor party
can be a success under conditions like that
it is the only thing that can.
This, from the British Budget speech,
strikes a familiar note :
The Australian and Maoriland debts have been
funded, and interest is being received regularly
amounting to £6,000,000 a year. The Canadian
debt is practically settled). A substantial part of
the South African debt has been paid off.
Yes, if any Dominion started early to pay
off its war debt to the harassed Old Man in
London it was safe betting that that place
wouldn’t be Australia. Our little share is
“funded.”
In the last tumultuous session of Queens-
land Assembly Speaker Bertram saved the
Government by his casting vote. If lie could
save himself by the same agency, or if the
Government could rush to the rescue with a
few hundred proxies, lie would be much
easier in his mind, for he is having a des-
perately hard fight in Maree. Two years
ago Bertram’s majority was a mere 149 in
a poll of 6179, and this time he is up against
a more formidable opponent in J. P. llether-
ington. Huxham, Minister of Public In-
struction, is rather uncomfortable in Bur-
anda, where his opponent is a school-teacher
whom he sacked a year or two ago; and it
is the same with Larcombe, the much-tra-
velled Minister of Railways, in Keppel,
Frank Brennan in Toowoomba, Mick Kir-
wan in Brisbane, Gilday in Ithaca, and
Cooper in Rosewood. But none are looking
bluer than Bertram.
People who live alongside cattle stations
belonging to the Queensland Government do
not rise up and call
it blessed except when
in drink. Dillalah
station, near Charle-
ville, for instance. It
was once in private
hands and carried
sheep, but the Gov-
ernment took it over
and put on cattle, it
having cattle on the
brain in those days.
There are about
12,000 of them on

“J. S. Garden, who went to Moscow to drink in wisdom, says that Bolshevism is a great and grand
thing for Russia, but he isn’t sure that it fits Australian conditions.”
Comrade Garden: “Ah, Bolshevism is a fine thing—but you must get out and smash
up your buggy first. And then you’d be able to eat your horse. And after that
you’d be able to walk and carry a Red Flag, see.”
some 400,000 acres. But the slump
in beef has made the Government
hate the very sight of a cow, and
meantime Dillalah threatens to become
a prickly-pear plantation and a playground
for dingoes. So, there being bore water on
the place, it has been surveyed into 20 big
farms; but the Government is shy about own-
ing up to failure and putting them on the
market.
From a State where the combat deepens:
A lot of its insufferable cocksureness oozed out of
the Queensland Labor Government when the Assembly
nominations closed. A month ago it counted on
the Opposition groups making it a present-of several
seats by reaching for one- another’s scalp, but there
won’t be much vote-splitting except in Port Curtis
and Murrumba,' and it may not be" serious there.
On- the other hand, two Agrarians—Clayton and
Walker —and one United party man—Appel-~
have been returned unopposed, and there are wo
Labor candidates in four other constituencies* whereas'
the one Laborite who got a walkover is Bulcock, who
sits for Bareoo, Tom Ryan’s old seat. Theodore-
himself has two opponents in Chillagoe, one Of them
being Gilbert Taylour, a returned .soldier, who.- hiB-
- an All-Australian League with a platform of
64 planks, the most important being Home Rule
for North Queensland. But the Premier is worrying
less about Chillagoe than about the fading prospects
of his party in other northern electorates,
notably Cook, Charters Towers and Kennedy. And
since he rubbed salt into the wounds of the Gov-
ernment servants, whose wages and salaries were
reduced when the bottom fell out of the loan boom,
there is a dreadful uncertainty about some of the
southern seats.
Vic. Parliament, which is now prorogued
till May 29, will not reassemble till July 4.
Ignoring the signs of stormy weather, the
Government is preparing a full sessional pro-
gramme. Lawson’s safety lies chiefly in
the dearth of leadership among the Liberals
and Farmers’ Unionists. Bowser’s failure
to score in 1917-18, when given a show,
has made the House suspicious of other ex-
periments in the same direction. But the
man may arrive with the hour.
High finance isn’t dead. It is in Queens-
land naturally that the finest recent scheme
has emerged. It concerns the repayment of
Federal debts. If Smith has lent the Com-
monwealth £1,000,000 and repayment day
has come, the suggestion is that his bank
shall put £1,000,000 of notes to his credit,
and the payment of his £50,000 p. a. interest
ceases. To recoup the bank the Government
is to give it £1,000,000 worth of other notes;
but it is not to circulate them, for if it did
the market would be flooded, and values
would go down like Niagara. The bank is to
“hold” the new million, and be paid 10s. p.c.
for “holding.” So the institution is to part
with a million that it can pay its debts with
or use to bring in, perhaps, £BO,OOO a year,
and get in return a different million that it
can’t pay anything with and which will bring
in £5OOO a year. The biggest bank would
close after settling with three such Smiths.
Half a Smith would break a small one.
A streak of bitterness concerning bad
people who “virulently assail the credit and
security of the State” and “belittle their own
country” runs through the Queensland Pre-
mier’s election speeches. Of course. Every
wild-cat politician whose
finances are on their last
legs talks as if he were “the
country”: so any comment
on him is a dragging of “the
country ’ in tile uusc. When
a Government is quite mad
in the cash-box the only
things that can be said, as
the beginning of an effort
to stop its career, are that
it is damaging the credit
and solvency of the country,
and that an indefinite eon-
tinuance of monetary madness must lead to
definite monetary smash.
As James Edmond sees it: —
Premier Theodore’s policy speech delivered at
Cairns had just one merit—it was the farthest-north
policy speech Australia has had. It may have
sounded eloquent, but it didn’t read that way to
any extent. It was vaguely and violently assertive.
The State Insurance Department, it seems, has
“saved the insurers a sum which is incalculable, but
must aggregate hundreds of thousands of pounds.”
How a mild little concern which, in 1921, blewed
nearly 35 per cent, of its life premiums on expenses,
while co-operative enterprise manages often with less
than half, saved its clients all that incalculable
cataract of coin was not explained. It couldn’t be.
The Queensland worker, according to Theodore, is
“the best-paid worker in Australia and among the
best-paid in the world.” The Federal Statistician,
with all the available information before him and
no election axe to grind, lately said that the Queens-
land factory toiler, anyhow, was worse-paid than him
(or her) of South A us., Westralia or N.S.W., and
was below the. Commonwealth average. So Theodore
should see him about it. Unemployment, according
to Theo., hardly exists save in the mind of the Tory
press. Yet the Federal Statistician, who isn’t a Tory
press, going by the figures supplied by trades-union
secretaries, said that at the end of 1922 Queensland s
unemployed record was the worst in his jurisdiction.
So Theo. should see these secretaries. He added
that £43,000,000 of new capital had been invested
in Queensland by confident and admiring friends
inside three years, and that his meatshops had
saved the community £3,000,000 in five years. But
he didn’t produce any of the capital or the meat. In
fact, he just dashed millions about till the air was
thick with them, and let it go at that.
When in Westralia Stewart, the Works
and Railways Minister, told the Cockies_
paper in that State that the government of
the Commonwealth Bank by a board ot
directors, “instead of the present control by
one man,” was discussed at the conference
which resulted in the two-headed Ministry,
and that “a measure to that effect will be
introduced.” It was given out in Sydney
recently that the dictatorship would be pre-
served. Someone must have wished before
he thought.
The big Beef interests have come to an-
other hurdle, and are not likely to scramble
over it without difficulty. The Bruce-Page
Government promised a bonus of id. a lb.
on the meat and 10s. per head on the living
animal exported, provided, among other
things, freight charges were reduced by
Jth of a penny a lb. But the shipping cos.
jib, unless port and harbor dues are revised
in their favor. And since port control is a
State function, there are prospects of vast
correspondence and another Premiers’ Con-
ference before the matter can be adjusted.
It looks as if the beef industry will have to
wait a while yet before it can be set up
again on its tottery legs.
Vic. Ministry is committed to erecting
“small but comfortable” homes on land taken
up by overseas settlers, but it is not going
to make the mistake of ordering enormous
masses of building material, as was done
by the War Service Homes Commission. The
newcomer will have a say in the location of
his home, and while he is gaining experience
on somebody else’s farm the shack will be
put up. There will be two or three months'
notice of the coming of batches, and an officer
of the immigration branch will meet immi-
grants at Fremantle or Adelaide. Before
he is sent up-country Choom will be accom-
modated at Richmond House, a coffee-palace
near the Richmond railway station, where
immigrants used to be drafted before the war.
“G.D.M.” mentions some others :
The Vic. State Savings Bank is another offender
against honest fiscal taxation: £1,500,000 of its
3 j p.c. short loans, due 1922-29, are subject to State,
but not to Commonwealth, taxation; and
£2,100,000 of its debentures are free from all
income-tax. Tasmania is the only State the interest
on whose local debt is subject to taxation. AH other
recent State loans are free of both Federal and State
taxes. The principle is utterly wrong and the
practice should be stopped in future loans. A good
deal of Commonwealth money is finding its way to
Maoriland for investment in the Discharged Soldiers’
Settlement Loan at 5J p.c. for 10 years, because it
is free of income-tax. Far and away the most seri-
ous tax-leakage is suffered by the Commonwealth
Government —£121,000,000 of its 4J stock and
bonds are non-taxable by anybody. That is to say,
the yearly interest amounting to £5,445,000
escapes income-tax in individual schedules. A cor-
responding amount of revenue must, of course, be
raised upon earned incomes. A minority of the
taxpayers year by year are escaping legitimate taxa-
tion on their incomes, and the large majority of tax-
payers will have to submit to more taxation, direct
and indirect, to make good the leakage. This country
is rapidly creating a class of non-taxable individuals.
It is not just and it is not democratic.
There has been another rumpus at Vic.
State Home for Waifs, and there is to be
another “reorganisation.” Eight of the
staff, including the matron’s sister, resigned
because they objected to an attendant. Four
repented and were reinstated. The matron
was awarded a transfer, but refused to
accept it. After she had bounced herself
out of the service somebody remembered
that she had had a round or two with the
Chief Secretary’s Department eight years
ago. The lady is probably done with Vic.
Government institutions now. The way of
the vigorous reformer is always hard.
It is becoming a perfect kaleidoscope.
First Dooley and Gardiner and Charlton
launched an appeal that Labor should sack
the executive for being “Red,” precipitate
and impossible. The executive, after scenes
of confusion, sacked Dooley instead. Then
he hunted round for a majority with which
to withstand the executive, and the “Red”
section of his Parliamentary party offered to
rally round him provided he became “Redder”
than the executive. So Dooley rushed to
the dye-works, and came back bright crim-
son and denouncing the executive for being
sluggish, conservative and behind the times,
like the House of Peers or Bruce Smith.
From his allotment in Brighton Cemetery
Tommy Bent still takes a hand in ruling
Victoria. His potter’s field at Thorrbury
(it is let on lease to the Glen Iris Brick
and Tile Co.) supplies bricks to the Public
Works and Railway Departments, and the
price, in trucks or carts, was lowered the
other day to 555. a thousand. Since Tummas
astonished Spring-street by suddenly buying
the land, the State must have made the
price of it several times over bv what it has
saved in the cost of bricks. Bent gave the
combine a smashing blow that time.

The tables cover operations for the 10 years
since the figures of the two departments
were separated in the published accounts.
The Provident is a fairly old co-operative
office, and though it has never been guilty
of riotous behavior when seeking new busi-
ness, it has not given shareholders much.
For many years only 5 p.c. p.a. (£1050) has
come from Industrial profits, while Ordi-
nary business is contributing but £llO p.a.
and Accident operations £lOO, the three to-
gether making only 6 p.c. That is very little
more than the average earnings of invest-
ments. Put another way, shareholders are
receiving no more than they could get from
gilt-edged securities, and nothing whatever
for the risks to which they have exposed
their capital, which is guaranteeing policy-
They are results on which sub-
scribers to the numerous new get-rich-
quick. life floats might well ponder. This
co. took over the Provident and Industrial
Insurance Co. 19 years ago, and began writ-
ing Ordinary policies in 1908. Combining
all operations progress has been as follows:
Total Expenses
Income. Claims, (inc. divs.).

1921 .. .. 128,688 29,612 46.981
1922 .. .. 141,178 35,520 49,650
The figures are not large considering the time
the co. has been in business, but more rapid
progress has been made in recent years:
Ordinary income has doubled in five years
and Industrial income in seven. The co. is being
conducted on sound lines, and its loss ex-
perience has been smaller than the expec-
tancy. The Ordinary expense-rate is being
kept down; last year’s 16.4 p.c. of total
income was about the „same as for the pre-
vious year. This was satisfactory, because
more than one-fifth of premium income was
from new assurances. Assuming old busi-
ness costs took 7 p.c. of renewal premiums,
then last year £5448 of first premiums were
won at a' cost of £4555, or slightly under
84 p.c., which is a better show.ng than is
made by many big competitors. In the Indus-
trial branch two points were clipped from the
expense rate, which was 42.4 p.c. last year,
compared with 60.5 p.c. only nine years ago.
The precise position of the Provident in
relation to its policy-holders is not visible
in the latest accounts. Actuarial valuations
are made every five years, and the next will
take place at the close of the current year.
At the 1918 investigation, in which 3J p.c.
was assumed as the future earning rate of
funds, surpluses were disclosed; and every-
thing appears to have operated in the co.’s
favor since. Besides lowered costs and a
smaller loss rate than had been allowed for,
interest earnings have gradually improved
until last year the Ordinary branch showed
a return on average funds of £5 16s. 6d. and
the Industrial £5 ss. 2d. p.c. There may
possibly be a bit more than 6 p.c. for share-
holders when the actuary completes his
figuring, but policy-holders have the call on
nine-tenths of all profits disclosed.
Paid capital is £21,000. Shareholders’
funds are included in the Industrial balance-
.sheet, which now totals £238.000, No less
than £201,855 of that is in Government and.
municipal securities. The Ordinary and
Accident balance-sheet, totting up, £161,329,
is 95 p.c. public securities. Investments are
a first-class lot.

This is a holding co. only, but it differs from
most of its type. Usually these holding cos.
have very little to say about their subsidiary
interests, and shareholders are in the dark
on most matters affecting their investment.
This one holds all the scrip (200,000 ful'y
paid £1 ordinaries V in Arthur Rickard and
Go., property salesmen and subdivisionists,
all except 278 of the 50,000 £2-paids in the
old Haymarket Permanent Land, Building
and Investment Co., Ltd., and the whole of
the 15,000 £1 ordinaries and all except 1101
of the 45,000 £1 prefs. in the Central Rail-
way Palace Buildings, Ltd. (Hotel Sydney).
Instead of the affairs of these cos. being hidden,
each publishes detailed accounts and reports,
and the parent co. is credited not only with
the divs. paid by the subsidiaries, but also
with its share of the undivided profits. In
this case the actual need for a holding Co. is
not apparent ; the present method necessi-
tates four separate Boards, and, perhaps,
three or four lots of Board fees—that is
one matter on which the fairly detailed
accounts are not informative. Possibly, how-
ever, financing is made easier by the separa-
tion of interests. For instance, here are the
combined liabilities of the three subsidiaries:
Deposits, Other

An adjustment or two may be required: for
instance, it is not clear whether the hotel
divs. (£6894) authorised on December 22
actually reached the parent within the next
nine days, when its accounts closed. The
net assets show a surplus of £65.836 over
and above paid capital, but £6736 had to
be provided for the parent’s final divs. The
difference between the amount remaining and
the £75,316 reserves in the introductory table
is mostly accounted for by the purchase of
the hotel shares at a premium : two p.c.
cum. prefs, were allotted for every hotel
pref. transferred'.
• * » ♦ » •
Because the Hotel Sydney has been pros-
pering and city property values have soared,
the A. R. Extended directors now propose to
set the printing presses busy on : new scrip
a la liusse. The £45.000 pref. capital is to
be doubled and the £15,000 ordinary capital
is to be trebled. This will give the holding
co. further scrip with a face value of £,3,899
which it can display in its balance-sheet. If
the re-construction ends there, the move is
of ho consequence ; it would not matter in
the least if the hotel share-register was ex-
panded a thousand times, for the volume of
scrip affects neither profits nor the actual
value of assets. But if the Extended share-
holder should also receive paper, because of
the alleged _ appreciation of values to the
extent of £75,000, the re-shuffle would assume
a serious aspect.
• * • • • •
At present the Arthur Rickard stable holds
(1) an hotel which has done very well since
it shook itself free of its early troubles and
most of its indebtedness; (2) an old land
and building co. which has been steadily un-
loading long-held properties at a good pr .fit
—it earned 10J p.c. on capital last year ♦
(3) a real-estate and subdivision co. which
is not doing magnificently: last year’s net
profit gave 4.3 p.c. cn its paid capital. Apart
from the hotel, the business depends on the
activity in land and property dealings and
the maintenance of city values. The turn-
over in recent years lias been remarkable,
particularly in view of post-war worries. The
congestion in the N. S. Wales capital has
suited this and other such cos. admirably,
and on present appearances the boom will
last for some time yet. On the other hand,
the .investor should remember that the land
business is one of the first to weaken in the
pulse if conditions do not continue favorable,
and it is not at all certain that present in-
flated values —inflated not only by an abnor-
mal demand, but also by the “prosperity”
created by huge Government loan-spendings
—will hold indefinitely. The Arthur Rickard
crowd are apparently satisfied with pros-
pects: they believe that “additional capital
can be profitably employed,” and are offer-
ing 50,000 8 p.c. first cumulative prefs., the
existing 200,000 7| p.c, cum. prefs. being
lifted half-a-point to compensate them for
the placing of the new issue ahead of them
for security of capital. Considering the
risks in the business—it is only necessary
to glance at events of 30 years ago to realise
what can happen subsequent to a sudden in-
flat’on of property values—the divs. which
Arthur Rickard Extended is paying are
slender.

At December 31 the Industrial, which for
almost half-a-century had been burdened with
the cumbersome title of Industrial and Pro-

vestment Society, had £36,196 more of its
own funds (£14,327 of which was accumu-
lated profit) and £57,326 more outside money
at work than there was only nine years-baclc.
Its mortgage business almost doubled during

The sale of office premises a few years ago,
which, incidentally, gave a profit over book
values of £BOOO, helped the loan business;
£4500 of War Loan and a little office furni-
ture are now the only assets apart from
advances. Notwithstanding higher mortgage
charges, which were, of course, offset by
more costly deposits, the demand for build-
ing loans, owing to the house-shortage and
stiff rents, has been very active in Sydney.

Java Australian Plantations, Ltd.—
Melbourne has had indifferent luck with its
rubber-plantation ventures : most were floated
during the big boom, and plantings matured
when prices were only a shadow of those at
flotation. Recently several of them have been
struggling to find funds to tide them over the
slump which has come since the world’s mar-
kets were glutted and prices fell below pro-
duction cost. Lately, owing to the restriction
of outputs on all British-controlled planta-
tions and better demands from manufac-
turers, prices have recovered again. But the
outlook is still uncertain; demand in rela-
tion to maximum outputs cannot be definitely
gauged. Nevertheless, Melbourne is now
being invited to finance a new plantation
proposition in Java, which “should pay big
dividends and yet be a safe investment.” Not-
withstanding the bitter experiences of the
past dozen years or so, rubber is to be “the
big money-spinner.”
The prospects of Java Australian Planta-
tions depend wholly on whether the promo-
ters’ anticipations as to costs and production
are borne out by operations. The co. is to
be in 300,000 shares of £1 each; 120,000 are
offered for a start, and are to be fully called
iip in 1926; 15,000 fnlly-paids are to be taken
by the vendor syndicate for “transfer of
•soptron and expenses up to the preparation
of prospectus”; and the balance of shares is
to be held in reserve. The estate comprises
7000 acres in Central Java, S to 12 miles
from the main-trunk railway, and the pur-
chase price is £13,400. Clearing of 1750
acres is to be undertaken on the Hoema sys-
tem, under which the natives clear and culti
vate the ground in return for the right to
plant catch crops between the young trees for
two years. The estate being located in a
densely-populated district, the promoters an-
ticipate that clearing and the first two years’
weeding will cost the co. nothing for labor,
and that an adequate team of cheap labor
will always be at command. Tea, cocoa and
coffee are to be side-lines. J. A. Wattie and
Co., who have controlled Java plantations
since the inception of the industry there, sup-
port the venture with figurings and opinions.
The bud-grafted method of rubber-planting
is proposed, and is expected to give larger
yields at lower cost. With ruling wages,
the all-in cost of a budded-rubber estate, pre-
sumably in full bearing, is estimated at 4d.
per lb. f.o.b. First profits are expected in
1927, and when the plantings are in full
bearing Wattie and Co. talk of 2.100,0001 b.
rubber giving an annual profit of £105,000
(rubber at Is. per lb.), 560,0001 b. tea giving
£19,000 and 5000 piculs of cacao £15,000.
They are impressive calculations, but there
have been so many slips between prospectus
anticipations and their realisation that this
type of investment is suitable only for those
who can afford to wait patiently for years.

Luke Mukas, Ltd., structural steel and
general engineers, bridge-builders, etc, (Syd-
ney).-—This co. has been in business 36
years, and has given good returns. It is
now being turned over to a public co, in
which the old proprietors take all except
£6049 of the purchase- consideration in shares.
The public is invited to assist the expansion
of the business with 35,000 £1 8 p.c. ctimula-
tive prefs., which will participate point for
point with ordinaries in any distribution in
excess of that rate. The pref. rights appear
to be well secured: no precise state-
ment of past profits is given in the prospec-
tus; but audited accounts * submitted to the
“Wild Cat” disclose that net earnings in re-
cent years have exceeded times the amount
required for the prefs. The new capital should,
of course, improve the position. Valuations
by Richardson and Wrench and Ross and
Rowe show £37,500 of net tangible assets in
the. business. Adding the £35,000 of new
capital, the cover for the prefs. wall approxi-
mate £2 Is. 6d. per £1 share. The float pro-
vides 20,000 fully-paid £1 ordinaries for good-
will. The old proprietors expect a regular
annual turnover of £150,000, and on a 16
p.c. basis, which is less than the average of
the past five years, £24,000 gross profit is
looked for. This would give £16,000-odd net,
or more than 17 p.c. on total ordinary and
pref. capital, prior to paying income-taxes.
On these figurings, therefore, the prefs. are
encouraged to hope for something more than
their basic div. The three Muras brothers
have contracted to run the business for five
years at £5OO p.a. each, plus 5 p.c. of net
profits divided between them. If their esti-
mates are realised, they would each receive
approximately £760 p.a., which is not costly
management.
U.S. Light and Heat Cokpokatio.n
(Aus.), Ltd,: —This , co. has been registered
in Sydney with a nominal capital of £50,000
to acquire manufacturing rights of the stor-
age-batteries produced by the U.S. Light and
Heat Corp.,, of Niagara (U.S.A.). That co.
has been in the Australian trade for .10 years.
The imported battery, however, suffers con-
siderable depreciation in transit, and is faced
with a duty of 40 p.c., freight and other
charges adding 15 p.c. more. Prac-
tically all the materials required are avail-
able in Australia, and the U.S. co. has de-
cided that it would be advantageous to allow
a local co. to manufacture, under its experts’
direction, on a. royalty basis. Rights, etc.,
have been acquired by engineers Cecil Har-
den and Howard Pitt, who take 7000 fully-
paids in the float. Frank Kern, the . U.S.
co.’s representative, also joins the enterprise.
Already 5000 shares have been placed, and
19,000 more are now offered for subscription,
and are to be called up to the extent neces-
sary to give £15,000 required to provide a
freehold plant, etc., and ample work-
ing funds. Profit estimates are based only on
motorrcar requirements, though Other oppor-
tunities are available for the enterprise; On
a yearly output of 5000 batteries, the - pro-
moters estimate that costs of manufacture,
including overhead exes, and royalties, will
run from £3 2s. to £3 7s. lOd. for three sizes,
the smallest type of which is now selling at
prices ranging from £lO 10s. to £l5 3s. For
this line the co. has decided upon a list
price of £9, with corresponding reductions
for bigger batteries. Allowing for all
charges (including taxation, advertising and
contingencies) and 40 p.c. discount for dis-
tributors, a net profit of £6OOO is anticipated
from 5000 batteries. That alone Would give
handsome returns on capital, and the pro-
moters expect additional profits from other
activities “without any further increase in
capital.”

For uninterrupted service Pioneer Wood Pipe
stands supreme. There is no hold-up of the water
service for cleaning or repairs, and the smooth
interior allows no lodgment for sediment or organic
growth. It is also rust and corrosion proof.
Another great advantage over other types of conduit
is its lightness, which speeds handling installation.
It pays to investigate its claims. The Australian

Lander Oil (Q.) has advanced another
step. Director James Burns cables: —
I have had all the geological specimens, informa-
tion, reports and maps checked by two independent
leading oil-geologists here [California] and their
opinion is that the co.’s prospects are as advised by
Milsom. They agree on the location of the bore.
So a modern rotary-drilling plant, costing
£12,000, including casing, has been ordered,
and should be delivered in Brisbane in July.
* * *
Driller Roy Fife is now down 2015 ft. for
Associated Oil, at Mt. Gambier (S.A.). The
drill is going through “dolomite and iron
pyrites in brown, sandy shale... .still show-
ing gas.”
* * *
The latest in Westralian oil is the alleged
discovery of a seepage some miles south of
the naval base at Cockburn Sound. Traces
of petroleum are claimed to have been
obtained from sludge taken from the edge
of a coastal lagoon. Two officials of the
Mines Department have visited the “find” to
take samples.
* » « *
Arthur Moore, who was in charge of the
Government bore at Roma, sails for the
U.S.A. next week to study the latest drill-
ing-plants and methods in use there. He
hopes to meet some of the leading oil-geolo-
gists, and to state the Commonwealth’s case
for petroleum occurrence. Apart from his
capacity as an engineer, Moore has studied
closely the geological side of the problem;
he is an omnivorous readei*, and can quote
details from any field of note in the woi*ld.
Before hustling to get into holts with Fritz,
he was boring for water in Western Queens-
land. After the war he went to Derbyshire,
and joined the Yankees who wei'e drilling
there. When he returned to Queensland he
took on the impossible job of attempting to
get out the tools left by the Yanks near the
bottom of the Roma bore. He expects to
be away about six months.

Lempriere and Co., Australian ore-buyers,
are making a big bid to secure the Austra-
lian tin-smelting industry. They are con-
structing a large, up-to-date tin-smelter at
Botany Bay (N.S.W.), and F. B. Jackson,
who was for 36 years in charge of the
Bisehoff .smelter*, is in control. Smelting
should be in full swing by about June. Suc-
tion gas is to be employed, and special appa-
ratus is to be installed to consume and save
by-products. For many years Lemprieres
shipped their purchased oxides to Straits
smelters, but in recent years they have pat-
ronised the Bisehoff smelters at Launceston.
The withdrawal of this ore from Bisehoff
will seriously inconvenience that old-estab-
lished industry, as not less than 1700 tons
oxide per annum is required to make smelt-
ing worth while. Speck tin-production has
declined so much that it will be difficult to
get adequate tonnages, especially as Lem-
priefes propose to enter the Tasmanian trade
by establishing an ore-buying agency at
Launceston. In fact, the competition threat-
ens to wipe out the Bisehoff smelting industry*.
* * * *
_ 'Fhe steady decline in the market price of
tin is probably attributable to the fact (offi-
cially notified) that 17,600 tons stored in
Mhlaya is to be disposed of at the rate of
880, tons per month. It is doubtful whether,
with the increased production caused by re-
cent enhancement in value and the release
of old stock, £2OO can be maintained. The
tilt market seems to be more at the mercy
of manipulators than any other, and the
position for some time to come will offer
plenty of scope for the operations of bulls
and bears.

Few men have had more experience of
mining eo. chairmanship than “Johnny”
Wharton, of Collins-street, and it is ques-
tionable whether any one of them has met
the same dilemmas as he has had to face
during the past fortnight. A meeting of the
Y-Water Tin Co., the object of which, prac-
tically, was to declare a div. of 2s. 6d. per
share, lapsed because the shareholders en-
titled to the div. could not, of themselves,
constitute the quorum—they must await the
magnanimity of the majority who have no-
thing to get, probably not even thanks.
Cock’s. Pioneer Co. shareholders were invited
to pass a X’esolution increasing the calling
power all round by 2s. 6d. per share. It
was necessary that 183 shareholders holding
60,000 shares should be represented, but only
seven attended in person, and vigorous
“whipping-in” produced only 53 proxies all
told, covering 40,000 shares. The meeting
was adjourned for a fortnight. Seemingly
shareholders will not attend personally, and,
unless the rules provide specifically to the
contrary, it is doubtful whether new proxies
can be used at an adjourned meeting.

Violent hostility is being shown on the
Westralian goldfields to the weird proposal
that the State should be divided into 30 areas,
and that some mysterious co. or cos. shouM be
given the sole right to work all abandoned
leases therein. So far Minister for Mines
Jack Scaddan has said nothing; but a num-
ber of restive goldfields local bodies want to
hold a free-lunch, free-beer and fi*ee-railway-
pass conference to discuss the scheme with
him.
Hampton Properties (W.A.) has started
its new mill on Block 45. A fair tonnage
of apparently good ore has been developed
in shallow ground, but unless the ore-body
proves to be different from anything else yet
worked at Hampton Plains, the co.’s profit-
earning prospects are not good.
* * * *
Ivalgoorlie has undertaken the flotation of
the Gt. Victoria, near Southern Cross. It
is probably the biggest low-grade gold deposit
in the West. Years ago it was sampled by
Bewick-Moreing, and later on by the Gt.
Boulder Proprietary, but both considered it
too poor for a co. With present costs the
prospects do not look good.
* * * *
Gt. Leviathan (W.A.) again obtrudes it-
self on public notice. This is the Yilgarn
show which Associated Northern acquired
in 1906 but abandoned a year or two later.
Several parties of working miners have
tackled it from time to time, and now an-
other party claims to have found a new lode.
The next move will probably be the taking
of an option by one of the many hard-up
Adelaide cos. which are always on the look-
out for new bait.
* * * *
Gerald ton (W.A.) is clamoring for the
early development of the Irwin coalfield. Its
value was talked about before the discovery
of Coolgardie, and one or two unsuccessful
attempts were made in the ’nineties to float
portions of it in London. No thorough pros-
pecting was done until a couple of years
ago, when the Government put down a bore
to 500 ft. and struck an llft.-seam with a
caloric value below that of Collie coal. Since
then Professor David has reported that a
coal-bearing area 40 miles square exists at
the Irwin, and its barrackers argue that that
opinion justifies further prospecting.
A Westralian co. with lots of faith and
little cash has acquired an osmiridium and
gold venture in Papua, and is talking big
about its prospects. Samples “taken over a
considerable area” are stated to have given
1 Adwt. to the cubic yard, equal to 30s. per
yd. at the present price of osmiridium. The
£lO shares are being divided into 40 of bs.
each.

Kalgoorlie is livening up again: it is re-
ported that several hundred more men are
likely to be employed within the next few
months.
* * • •
A Kalgoorlie man has a look at Mt. Jug-
lah (W.A.) -
Ccs., syndicates and others who boomed this field
as another Golden Mile are now doing their best to
live their conduct down. Reputable mining men and
other “experts” who referred to the “fine lodes
existing there in similar rocks to the Golden Mile”
ought to be prosecuted for libelling Kalgoorlie.
There is no lode in the Mutooroo area; the gold-
bearing material is a quartz-reef, and nothing else.
Oustide of it values wouldn’t go a ’weight to the
cubic kilometre. The country rock, instead of being
“similar to the Golden Mile,” is a hungry-looking
porphyry, and there are miles of it.
All the same, there are many torn of payable
quartz in the Mutooroo lease; but it is only a
syndicate show, and no good to a co. As for the
rest of the shows, all I can say is that they would
make good pastoral areas.
* * * *
Coal, Ltd., has again been endeavoring to
raise funds overseas to enable the Appin
property (N.S.W.) to be opened up, but
Capital is still shy, although the bore on the
Douglas Park area proved the presence of
a splendid seam of coal. All that can be
done at present is to let the surface rights
to tenants. The co.’s other string is the
Mt. St. Vincent property, over which the
Broken Hill Prop, holds an option until July.
That co. is now prospecting the ground to
see if there are more seams of coal than so
far disclosed. Chairman Fleming has no doubt
on the point, and surmises that the option
will be exercised. If so the faithful few, who
have had their interests heavily written
down in reconstructions, will get something.
• • * •
Electrolytic Zinc has decided to go ahead
with the installation of a silver-lead mill at
Zeehan (Tas.). It is to have a capacity of
50 tons of milling ore per day, and is really
a sop to keep the Zeehan critics of the co.
silent. The most that can be said of the
move is that it will provide a treatment
plant for low-grade ores with a capacity
for greater than present Zeehan production.
Apparently nothing is to be done for years
with the great ore reserves of the Read-
Rosebery groups, which to-day should be em-
ploying a thousand or so men. Probably
no attempt will be made to extract the mil-
lions in these great deposits until public
opinion forces the co. to cease regarding
itself as a heaven-sent trust with the
right to tie up the Speck’s natural resources
as it thinks fit. Properly worked, the Mt.
Read-Rosebery group would be a big finan-
cial help to Tas., and might even put the
Emu Bay Railway Co. on a profitable basis.
Just what the lead-milling plant will mean
to Zeehan is a matter of conjecture: the
major portion of the galena of this field is
exported and sold as crudes. Zeehan opera-
tors have always hand-picked their ore to
a remarkable degree: in March, for instance,
seven producing mines output 127 tons ship-
ping ore and 140 tops milling material. The
Electrolytic will apparently have to convince
operators that less hand-picking and more
milling is a good proposition if it is to
obtain 1200 tons of milling ore per month.
The improvement in the tin market has
induced the directors of Bischoff Extended,
Waratah (Tas.), to re-open the old show.
Late manager Schell is to have charge again,
and will endeavor to find something new and
at the same time attempt to win profits
from the sadly depleted ore-reserves. At
depth the mine has been a big disappoint-
ment, nothing of importance having been
found below No. 6, although many hundreds
of feet of prospecting have been done there.
The lode is small and hard, and lies at a
very flat angle, all of which contributes to
make extraction costly. Very little profit,
if any, can be expected with tin below £250.
* * * *
The installation of the hydro-electric plant
at the Magnet (Tas.) hasn’t proved an un-
mixed blessing: the dam capacity has proved
too small for normal requirements. Twice
during the past four months the mine has
been thrown idle owing to insufficient power
to hoist and to keep the workings dry. These
stoppages have considerably curtailed pro-
duction and development. Much interest
centres around whether development from
the bottom level will disclose a shortening
of the ore-shoot and throw light on the
theory of the gradual replacement of galena
by zinc. A new water-supply is being tapped
by a race to the Arthur River, and that
should make the co. independent of rainfall
for a few months at a stretch. The grade
of the crudes shipped has fallen off lately: a
recent parcel of 16 tons assayed only 28 p.C.
lead.
# * * *
Development work on Badak’s gold ven-
ture at the old Golden Gate mine (Tas.)
is giving encouraging results at Nos. 2 and
4 levels. Sloping is being done at Nos. 4
and 5 on ore running 2ft. to 4ft. wide, and
the mine has been unwatered to below No.
6 level. A crushing of 220 tons was com-
pleted on April 6 for a return of 930 z.—
520 z. from amalgamation (average .2370 z.
per ton) ; 250 z. in concentrates (.113oz.) ;
and 16oz. estimated to have been absorbed
by plates. A recovery of only 7dwt. per ton
is not going to show much profit, if any,
especially as the concentrates require further
handling to extract the gold.
♦ * * •
The official figures for Queensland’s 1922
gold yield are: 80,5840 z. (fine) worth
£342,300, as against 40,3760 z. and £171,504
for 1921. Mt. Morgan was idle for the
greater part of 1921, and was alone respon-
sible for 32,0740 z. of the increase. Gympie
was the only field which registered any not-
able increase (92910 z.) and this was mainly
due to three or four crushings of sensational
richness from No. 4 North Phcenix, backed
by a steady flow from low-grade ore on the
Scottish Gympie’s Inglewood reef. Unfor-
tunately, the Phoenix at present does not
look like repeating the performance. The
Towers slipped back 16440 z. (fine), and
things look black there. Theodore has pro-
mised a big subsidy for a deep shaft there
if recommended by the Government Geolo-
gist. The last scheme for a 4000 ft. shatt
was turned down with a bump by Dr. E. O.
Marks.
* * * *
At the first bore-site near the Great North-
ern Extended shaft, Gympie (Q.), selected
by geologist L. C. Ball, a depth of nearly
300 ft. has been reached by driller Sandstedt,
the last part of the journey being through
shales and lime. Another 300 ft. or 400 ft.
will be required to test the theory that the
auriferous plumbago beds run through this
section of the field. Although the field’s out-
put revived last year, there is a feeling
now’ that it was rather a flash in the pan.
If boring succeeds in tapping plumbago, the
outlook for Gympie will be much brighter.
* * * *
The Golden Horseshoe, Mt. Coolon (Q.),
made its last call on subscribed capital last
November, bringing the total to £4OOO. It
is now r out of funds, and has applied for six
months’ exemption to raise capital. There
is nothing wrong with the size of the reef;
but values are uncertain —they may be good
or otherwise, and a bulk crushing is neces-
sary to settle the point. Assay values vary
in every few feet of the lode.
If the copper market holds there is a
chance of the Great Fitzroy, at Mt. Chal-
mers, opening up again. D. J. Huntley has
interviewed the Minister for Railways re-
garding freight concessions and railway
arrangements. It will oe a big thing for
Rockhampton if it comes off. The mine
has had a long spin: it started as a gold
show in 1860, finally became copper, and
has witnessed many reconstructions. Much
English capital has been sunk there. The
last operations were in 1918, although no
ore was raised. Prospecting from Murray’s
shaft failed to locate ore, and experiments
for more economical treatment w r ere in pro-
gress w’hen the market crashed and resulted
in a closure.
Allora, near Warwick (Q.), is opening up
a new find of coal in a handy spot, close
to the iron-rails. So far three seams have
been proved, but the middle sft. looks best
at present, although it has a couple of bands.
There is a big seam below this, but it is
badly banded. Tannymorel, after a lot of
work since the fire, has got on to a oft.
seam, and is turning out up to 130 tons
a day.
* * * *
Holmes and party, who are prospecting
the Mundic King, Cooktown (N.Q.), don’t
agree with the “Wild Cat” that the discovery
is “a poor thing.” They talk of samples
from the bottom of the shaft going more
than 20z., and of a lode “the full width of
the shaft.” Well, The Bulletin’s informa-
tion is that 6 tons returned 26dwt. at the
Towers battery, an average of 4.3dwt. per
ton. But this paper hopes that all the rest
of the ore in the mine is as good as the
samples now mentioned.
* * * #
There is a prospect of the Tariff Board
protecting the budding marble industry from
the effects of the dumping of Italian marble,
due chiefly to the depreciation of the lira.
There is a prospective white marble indus-
try ih the Commonwealth; there are
several good deposits in South Aus. and
Queensland. But they cannot make a do of
things while Carrara comes in dressed for
under £1 per cubic foot.

Austral Malay has almost completed bor-
ing its Mergui property (Lower Burma),
and so far 600 acres of 15ft. dirt have been
proved to contain 14 million c. yd., worth on
an average lslb. per yd. The co.’s prospect-
ing staff has gone to Upper Burma to test a
gold-dredging proposition which has been
optioned.
# • * *
Dome Rock copper, Mingary (S.A.), is
being looked over by 8., M. and Co. Some
rich ore was obtained at shallow depth, but
not a great deal of development has been
done since the show was discovered in 1918.
A number of mining men have examined
Dome Rock, but no one seems to have been
enamored of chances at depth. There are
162 shares of £lOO paid in the syndicate,
and a few have changed hands at as much
as £3OO. Five other syndicates, with capitals
ranging from £lOOO to £2OOO, were formed
in Adelaide with the object of getting inter-
ests in the district.

"and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Lex’s” view of it: —
The Mitchell case in Melbourne was analogous in
many respects to the Crippen case in England. In
both there was a body that the Crown had to put a
name to, and in both the Crown used the argument,
“If thq woman is alive whom we say is dead why
doesn’t. she come forward ?” In both, by the time
scandal and hearsay evidence had done their work,
THEBE UNREASON ABLE WOMEN.
“Why did you and Louise part?”
“She said I wasn’t regular in my habits; yet I’ll swear I’ve been
to her house every evening since we were first engaged,
drunk or sober. What more can she leant?”
tremendous cases had been built up in the opinions
of the Solons of the kerbstone and the suburban
train and tram. But while the science of medicine
hanged Crippen, the science of law saved Mitchell.
The difficult business of her counsel was to persuade
the jury to find on nothing but the evidence before
them. He relied on the classic manner, which, as
in every other form of art, is based on econopiy of
effort; and again it was proved that this is the
winning manner. He was prepared at every stage
to go with the Crown all the way until it came into
conflict with the heart of his case. The jury was not
confused or wearied by trivial objectibns and. tedious
arguments. The defence opened at 10 on Friday
morning, and it was finished, addresses and all, by
half-past 5 that afternoon. In those few hours
Cussen succeeded in reducing the monstrous fabric
built up by the original press-icum-bar-room trial to
a thing of skin and bone resting almost entirely on
the evidence of the unspeakable Bonfiglio and Mrs.
Milward, who, if the accused was guilty, were, on
their Own testimony, equally guilty with her. In
the circumstances an acquittal was almost inevitable.
But equally inevitably, in the hands of an inferior
advocate, the coroner’s court “evidence” would have
hanged her. Mrs. Mitchell is at large to-day because
she is rich.

“C. Snook” : It is a mistake to waste valu-
able fuss on trifles, because (1) people grow
used to it and cease to be impressed, and
(2) it may be wanted for bigger things. The
protest of all manner of towns, villages and
hamlets, also some burghs and claehans,
against the visit of the King and Queen to
the Pope is an example of misplaced fuss.
Almost the last English sovereign who visited
a Pope was Canute, and as that was nearly
900 years ago the thing isn’t a habit. Any-
how, this is a different Pope from the one
Canute saw, so there is a natural and reason-
able desire to inspect him. The surest way
to a liberal education is to inspect every-
thing that is going, and monarchy should
have a liberal education. Besides and this
should be, taken into serious accohnt —his
Majesty may be.actuated by the worst inten-
tions. lie may be a bitter Orangeman at
heart, and be anxious to, gloat over what he
hopes is a- perishing institution. Why should
not Protestant Federations and such like
give him the benefit of the doubt and hope
for the worst?

“Rodney”: When Arnold Weinholt got the
Moreton (Q.)? seat in the Federal House, he
decided that liis Parliamentary salary should
be wholly devoted to the four main hospitals
in his electorate—lpswich to get half and
Boonah, BeaudeSert and Laidley the rest--
on condition that the fact should not be
made public. Not. until a few days ago,
when it was suggested that the publication
of the identity of the anonymous donor might
help the Ipswich Hospital in its appeal for
subscriptions, would he remove his embargo.
Then it was found that Weinholt’s gener-
osity had benefited the institution by £2700
(including subsidy), and the other grouped
hospitals by a like amount. Even before
this, when he was elected for Fassifern in
the State House, Weinholt’s first year’s salary
went to the Boonah Hospital. A rare speci-
men of the political bird. But the atmo-
sphere of a party Plouse was not congenial
to him, and he 'made an early flight from
Parliament. He is now in London, prepara-
tory to another big game hunt.

On the struggle of Costs to earn his fee:
In a recent M.L. prosecution under the Sale of
Food and Drugs Act, counsel for the defendant,
charged with selling
bad strawberries, sub-
mitted that the box
contained good fruit
when it left the shop,
and that his client was
not vicariously liable
for the subsequent wan-
ton act of a straw-
berry. The plea didn’t
go, but a motorist who
had run over a cow,
and was being sued for
damages by the ani-
mal’s owner, was suc-
cessful in the defence
that, although he was
on the wrong side of
the road, the cow had
the opportunity of
avoiding the accident,
and was therefore
guilty of contributory
negligence. Possibly
the duck case referred
to by Sir Henry Haw-
kins (as he then was!
in the Tichborne trial
is the best instance of
a wide selection of
pleas. Seven defences
were put forward to
explain how the duck
came into the pos-
session of the accused.
He bought it and paid
for it; he found it; it
had been given to him ;
it flew into his garden;
he was asleep and
someone put it in his
pocket. The other
two don’t matter; a
bewildered jury acquitted, anyhow.
“M.D.” is reminiscent:—
The older N, S. Wales practitioners are gasping
with astonishment, not unmixed with horror, at the
torrent of new blood that streamed into the
medical profession in April. From the truly
awe-inspiring list two names, because of the fathers
who also bore them, stand out pre-eminently—Ander-
son Stuart and Angel Money. The latter took pretty
well everything before him in the way of prizes.
Only three out Of the 96—Pye, Money and Ponton —
got into the first-class honors list, which shows the
severity of the test and the intellectual calibre of
the placed men. When Professor Anderson Stuart
started the Medical School, over 40 years ago, he
had one student, Parson Rutledge; next year there
were six. The parson was ploughed for his final
exam., and had to put in an extra year, so he just
missed the glory of being a' pioneer graduate “on r.is
lonesome.” I remember the young Ettles scholar,
as Anderson Stuart was then, fresh from his exam-
THE CURE.
“You’re looking frightfully miserable, Joe. Why don’t you

“Do you think that would cheer me up?”

ination triumphs and his lectureship in physiology
under Professor Rutherford in Edinburgh, addressing
with undismayed confidence his little band. He
lectured in both anatomy and physiology at first, and
I recollect well the glitter of his glasses, and the
little black velvet cap stuck rakishly on the back
of his head, and his impressive delivery. He was
a strict disciplinarian, and kept his class well in
hand, we thought; but there was a yarn current at
the time that Professor Rutherford preferred the
severity of the beloved Haycraft, who died only the
other day, aged over 80. There was no more popu-
lar teacher in Auld Reekie than he. The Professor,
in order to stimulate us to study anatomy, used to
say that in his student days he carried the carpal
bones in his pocket, in order to distinguish their
surfaces by the sense of touch, which revealed an
anatomical enthusiasm probably never equalled before
or since. The late Dr. Angel Money before he
came to Australia was engaged in writing editorials
from morning to night, was deeply versed in the
literature of his profession, and qualified early as a
consultant. To his wards at University College,
London, where he was one of the physicians, flocked
the elite of the students, who were attracted by his
personality, his profound grasp of medical problems,
and his methods of teaching. The father’s
ability,. both clinical and theoretical, nas
apparently descended on the son, who got the prizes
both for medicine and surgery, and was prox. ace.
for the blue ribbon of the final exam., the Honors
medal. ' \,

“Centurion”: “Sucre” (B. 12/4/’23) asks
why an admiral is forbidden by King’s Regs,
to carry an umbrella, on a wet day. He
isn’t; but he is told to wear a prescribed
uniform on prescribed occasions; and a gamp
isn’t included in the prescription. Exactly
the same' thing applies to officers of the
Royal Marines and the army. The old Duke
of Cambridge, Commander-in-Chief before
Wolseley, always carried a gamp at wet-day
parades, in spite of the-, omission of the Regs,
to include: it iii the outfit. But, as he was
a Royal Prince, boss cocky of the show, and
an i arrogant old Hun to boot, there was no
one!, to say him nay.

“Bauliinia”: If a Mongolian’s hair be cut
transversely it will be found to be perfectly
circular, while in the Caucasian race it is
oval. This accounts for the bristling and
general straightness of the Mongol’s hair,
and for the smooth, wavy or curly Cau-
casian’s. To test a supposed Mongolian who
claims Caucasian ancestry upon entering
Australia the medical officer is often worried
about his diagnosis, anthropology not being
an exact science, but I believe the tests
mentioned by “Kip” (B. 15/3/’23) are in-
fallible. At Townsville (Q.) about 1917 the
authorities charged a boy—apparently full
Chinese—with being a prohibited immi-
grant. The defence was that he was
born in Queensland of a half-caste
white-abo. woman, his father being full
Chow, and that he had merely gone
to China for his education. Counsel were
engaged on both sides, and four medical wit-
nesses were called, among them Dr. Priestley,
mentioned in the article “Twin Scourges
of the North” (B. 15/3/’23), who at that
time was making a survey of the school
children of Townsville in connection with
the research work- of the Tropical Institute.
His evidence, similar to "Kip’s,” together
with the hair test, cranial and nasal indices,
etc., was the deciding factor in the case, and
the, defendant was adjudged to be a full-
blooded Mongolian. It was subsequently
admitted that the judgment was correct.
“Stellsby” : Tradition rules that an A.B.’s
pants are to be "like
a gramophone horn'’
(B. 12/4/’23), be-
cause he can then roll
them up well above
his knees when wash-
ing an d , sernbb i>g
down decks. Rubber
seaboots for this j< b
are affected mainly by
the blite of the mercan-
tile marine. An ad-
miral is denied the
privilege of “pushing
up a brolly on a wet
day” for the same rea-
son that a flower in
his buttonhole is
tabooed —the senior
service doesn’t breed
old women and fops.
In the R.N. in home
waters all ranks and
ratings, from admiral
to 0.D., must wear a
greatcoat (or “British
warm” in the case of
officers) from October
till May. Cap-covers
are also pr o-
hibited over that
period. From May
till October an oilskin
(or a light black mac-
intosh in the case of
officers) is the only
protection which the
regulations allow
against inclement
weather; but cap-
covers are worn. In
the R.A.N. cap-covers are worn the whole
year round; but even that somewhat lax
service shuts down on brollies.
Reflections of the Office Sexton: —
“The League of the Church Militant” has got
busy in England about the reform of the marriage
service. It seeks to abolish the bride’s promise to
obey, as a relic of slavery; the “giving away” of
the bride, as if she were a bit of goods; and the
bridegroom’s lying promise to bestow on the lady
all his worldly assets, when everybody knows he
must keep something to wear. Other weak points
are the promise to “love and honor,” which is
often impossible, as anybody can sec; by a mere
glance at the bridegroom ; the undertaking to stick
together till death, as if there were no divorce
courts; and the ring, which is said to be really
the noose at the end of the rope with which our
remote ancestress, the Matildadon, was lassoed and
taken home to her new owner’s cave. The trouble
is that it seems almost necessary to say something
pleasant and frilly on an occasion which is sup-
posed' to> have a streak of romance about it. If the
official marrier adhered strictly to matters he is
sure ' about, he could only state that Henry and
Gwendoline had decided to try living together, and
A PERMANENT JOB.
HIS DAUGHTER : “Well, I’m going to ring
up no w. Do yon want the taxi by the
hour, or shall I say you’ll take it for the
day?"
FATHER ( looking for a house): “Ask him
what will it be by the year?”
in conformity with the Act he authorised them to
do so. This made the arrangement legal, unless
one or both of them had one or more husbands or
wives living already, in which case the business
was null and void, as w’ell as criminal. He might
add that he hoped they would be happy, but it was
best not to expect too much. He wouldn’t say
“Amen,” it being superfluous, but would depart
shaking his head.

A SONG OF RESIGNATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 once knew a gay, undefeatable crone
Who flourished on hunger and sniggered at sorrow.
Xor cared if her fingers were worked to the bone,
Or if beer or if breakfast were sure for the morrow.
If the Old Man was boosing-, or out on a strike,
And she’d nothing, or no one, to bite or to sup
with,
She’d say: “Well, Gor’ bli’ine, it ain’t w’at y’ like,
But just w’at y’ got to put up with.”
And ever since then, when a bothering blur
Obscures fair horizons, or blown to a bubble
Are all the fine schemes of myself, or McGirr,
1 think of the lady and snort at the trouble.
If those we’ve played up to develop the spike
And leave us but little to sweeten our cup with,
We’ve this consolation —it ain’t what we like,
But just what we’ve got to put up with.
It may irk one to toil, while the loafers amass
The root of all evil for which we all hunger;
To watch wealth descend on the blatant and crass
And Beauty embracing the fat profttmonger.
We pay for the Rolls-Royce affected by Ike,
While there’s nothing left us to buy “Lizzie” or
“Hup.” with,
Still, let us remember, it ain’t what we like,
But just what we’ve got to put up with.
If sad is the path of the singer of lays,
And the rivers of ink that he sheds on white paper
Bring little or nothing of guerdon or praise,
Though freely and fairly his fancy may caper,
And the Editor says, with a chirp like a shrike,
“Yes, I’m using- your verses—to poison my pup
with!”
Well, always remember it ain’t what you like,
But just what you’ve got to put up with.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Burdekin House, Syd-
ney (B. 19/4/’23). The place as it stands
is not as it- was built by Thomas Burdekin,
wholesale iron merchant, in 1842. North
and south wings were added when Sydney
Burdekin, on the death of his mother, came
into possession. The house just to the north
was built by Sydney Burdekin on the site
of John Tawell’s chapel—a gift to the
QUITE A FAILURE.
ONE DOCTOR: “You were treating Brown for loss of memory. Was
it a success?”
ANOTHER: “Well, he didn’t regain it sufficiently to remember to
pay his bill.”
Society of Friends, who, however, did. not
accept it. Incidentally, Henry Parkes, after
leaving John Jamison’s employment, was en-
gaged by Tom Burdekin in his iron store*
Notwithstanding Ms later political associa-
tion with the Burdekins, their name does
not appear in any of Parkes’s assignment

Hal Gye comes out flat for flats:—
These sneers about flats make me tired. I’ve been
a flatite for over two years, and my son is a flatite
—and we’re in such good health that I’m willing to
fight any bloke on any paper at my weight, and my
son is willing to take on any-
body’s kid one-hand-kneeling.
Flats are no worse than small
terrace houses are—in fact, they
are better. They’re more com-
pact, better ventilated, more com-
fortable, better designed, and
much easier to keep clean. The
woman who lives in a flat has
less scrubbing and general mess-
ing about than the woman in a
house; consequently she doesn’t
grow old so quickly, doesn’t ruin
her hands so quickly, and doesn’t
look so down-at-the-mouth all
day and half the night as her
sister in the house does. Her
husband can’t come home and
pull the place down, he can’t
swear as loud as husbands in
houses can—the other people in
the flats won’t stand it. And the
wives have a better time. A
woman in a flat can’t go out to
see the baker without being seen
by the other women, so she keeps
spruce—she doesn’t hang about
•all day with her hair half down
and Jier blouse anyhow. VVhe'n
' friends call they can’t bang the
jiiano or keep the gramophone on
' jpast a decent hour; if they want
to do so you can tell them the
landlady won't allow it, so they
desist and leave fairly early, and
husbands don’t have to sit up
and listen to them talking a lot
about nothing. There are no
mad beer parties. There’s noth-
ing but peace—each flatite de-
mands it of the other. And there
are children. The mothers take
the kids out to play in the gar-
dens—they don’t play in. the
gutters —and they’re looked after
and they’re bathed daily. (There
is a real bath in every flat, and
hot water.) And neither the wives
nor the husbands bring home lum-
ber and useless rubbish, because
there’s no place to put it, and the
tenants have to have proper rubbish-bins and keep them
clean, and mustn’t put dead crajfish in the back lane,
nor leave dirty water in the washhouse. There are
regulations to abide by—and that’s more than you
can say of some houses.

“Sykes”: It was not the generosity of
Italy which allowed “Kelvin” (B. 5/4/’23)
to travel first class
from end to end of
the country on a
second-cjass naval
pass—it was the
generosity of the
conductor. I, a
“pongo” on leave,
bought a first-class
ticket from Pars
to Rome. In
France I was
allowed to reserve
a seat in the train,
hut at Milan, in
Italy, had to alight,
as I was on a
rapid, and only offi-
cers were allowrd
to travel on express
trains. Moreover,
an English captain
R.T.O. was there
to see that I didn’t.
Afterwards I
couldn’t b. u y a
first-class ticket in
Italy “officers
only” again. As 1
didn’t feel deposed
to go second-class,
I travelled first-
class without a
ticket and worked
the “no eompree”
stunt, the conduc-
tor doing the rest.
Though he couldn’t
read a word of
English he scanned
my leave papers,
pass, passport, etc.,
most carefully ard
handed them
with a salute. The

'they are not.” Hear me. Two years ago F ; tz«:
william, jun., brought home his card from
the rnedical inspector, the diagnosis be ; ng
adenoids in an advanced stage, and an imme-
Mate operation recommended. I took the
boy at once to the general practitioner who
brought him into the world, and has more
or less looked after him ever since, and was
told that there was no sign of adenoids.
THE DOUBTER.
ERN ( endeavoring to clinch his argument): “Well, seeing
is believing!”
PEARL: “Nothing of the kind. I see you every day!”
Another local man confirmed the family
doctor. Still not satisfied, I took Junior
off to a Macquarie-street nose and
throat specialist—which, incidentally, in-
volved a 700-mile journey—and was
again told that the boy was perfectly
sound. The whole business cost me just
under £2O; but when I asked the Education
Department to repay me I was told that the
Department could accept no responsibility.
Next time Junior brings me his medical card
I shall burn it before worse happens.

Blood-curdling note from a laboratory :
The semi-official statement was re-
cently made at a meeting of the
British Chemical Society that the
War Office has now at its disposal
gases 3000 times, more deadly than
the “mustard” gas and phosgene used
in France, and that English chemists
are at work with the object of pro-
ducing gases deadlier still. Other
European Governments and that of
the United States are also pushing
on research work with the same
gruesome object. The U.S. maintains
a Department of Chemical Warfare,
which has a staff of over 300 expert
chemists. Yet it is doubtful if
there are three men in the Common-
wealth who are thoroughly familiar
with the latest advances in this branch
of chemical science, or who could
prepare gases to compare with those
that would be pretty sure to be used
against a defending Australian army
in the event of invasion. Such work
is of a highly technical nature, de-
manding .intensive study, and it is
not the sort to which the average
chemist, no. matter how skilled in
other directions, can turn his hand
at a moment’s notice. Seeing the
comparatively-email amount that the
creation of a Government Research
Laboratory would cost and the enor-
mous return that might some day be
obtained, the Federal Ministry, which
is talking a good deal about the
defence of Australia, might well give
the matter a little attention. .
“Tauwarra” considers the leper:—
Does modern leprosy differ in any way from the
leprosy of the Bible? “S. Q. fiaplus” (B. l/’3/’23)
thinks hot; but his opinion is not shared by many
medicoes in Papua, where the disease is common.
One of them thinks that the leprosy of Biblical
times may have been “sepoma,” a relatively harm-
less skin disease of horrible unsightliness which
afflicts. Brown Brother in practically every island
of the N.-W. Pacific. I have never seen “a leper
white as snow,” but in any Papuan village, scaly
horrors, whose lives are one; long scratch, are to be
found, measuring up in every respect to the Bibli-
cal specification. Is there any reason, apart from
the Old Testament tradition of “uncleanness,” for
confining a white leper in a lazaret, until he either
dies or escapes ? Leprosy must have existed in
Papua for centuries, but no particular precautions
have been found necessary to prevent its spread. In
the Commonwealth, where it is a notifiable disease
in every State, under 550 cases had been recorded
up till 1915. In neither country is it a factor
of importance in the health of the community, and
on a comparison with T. 8., which killed 3000 Aus-
tralians in 1920, or V.D., upon which ICuibbs is
discreetly silent, it looks as if the annual cost or
the four Australian lazarets might well be diverted to
some more useful purpose.
“Sidweelari”: My suburban undertaker
friend, of whom I have spoken before, is an
affable soul, whose only weakness is a,habit
af applying the terms of his calling to inci-
dents of the day. I looked in at his home
the other evening to inquire about the health
of Mrs Shroud, who had been indisposed.
“Oh, She’s all right again, thanks,” replied
the genial ghoul. “She’ll be clown in a
minute —she’s just upstairs screwin’ the kids
down for the night.”
“H. Me.”: While, the ultimate fate of the
Tutankhamen mummy is under discussion,
it’s worth while recalling that in Elizabethan
times it was a common habit to suck or chew
mummy for lung complaints. The best dope
came from graves in Arabia, and Syria, and
Harjey : street specialists of the day had an
extraordinary predilection for prescribing the
mummy that was virgo Intacta.

“S. Q. Lapins”: “O.McL.” (B. 5/4/’23)
remarks that “very seldom is the . hero pf a
novel a doctor.” I fervently add, “Thank
God!” He is, as “CIMcL.” postulates,
slightly cynical, inquisitive, mocking, in-
tensely sceptical, intensely credulous, kindly
and a generous slave to duty. But I doubt
whether he is agnostic and epicurean, albeit
many of us are connoisseurs of tobacco and
the more humble alcoholic beverages. It is
unsafe to dogmatise further. The profession
is in a state of flux—the transitional stage
between a profession arid a trade. The old-
time family doctor, cultured, benevolent, in-
tensely lovable, suave, a true friend, conver-
sant with each individual’s ailment and dia-
thesis (forgotten, unfortunately, too often),
has almost disappeared. Gone' are the blue
pills, the rich milk of human kindness, the
monaural stethoscope and the cheery nature.
Instead, there is, with the sinister connivance

obvious abilities, he suffers from delusions
about Ms own skill. His conversation hinges

A SURPRISE FOR WILLIAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
William Cunningham, was charged with cruelty
to his horses. An inspector said two of the cases
were the worst he had seen: a horse had been beaten
to death with a hay batten. In reply to the magis-
trate, the defendant said he did not \Vish to say
anything. He coidd only contradict the evidence.
He thought the less said on the whole matter the
better.”—S. M, Herald.
Accused ( affably ) :
I’d much prefer to let this question drop,
To treat it all as though it had not been.
It rests upon the say-so of a cop
Whom previously I’d not so much as seen—
A man whose looks do not appeal to me,
And whose society I never sought.
Upon reflection you’ll no doubt agree
The case is one that should not have been brought.
Magistrate (dazed):
But why —
Accused ( sharply ) :
Why not f That, sir, is my retort....
I understand precisely how you feel.
Here, on the one hand, you reflect, we find
A coarse policeman who desires to steal
The reputation of a man as kind
As ever stepped the earth —
Policeman (sotto voce) :
Lord strike me blind!
Accused :
Here is a gentleman, you argue; there
A Uniformed outsider. How absurd
To hesitate respecting such a pair:
To doubt the one, to take the other’s word!
Let bygones bygones be! A stitch in time
Saves much that otherwise would wilt and spoil.
Least said is soon—
Magistrate :
To check you is a crime
And yet I must. Six weeks of steady toil

Just step below,- me lad, an’ shut, yer face.

Some April anniversaries: Henry Parkes
died on the 27th April, 27 years ago ; Capt.
Cook entered Botany Bay, 153 years ago on
the 28th ; and the race meeting held at Parra-
matta, 30th April, 1810, was the first in
Australia.
“Gadoiteha”: Harold G. Nelson, who is
to represent the N. Territory in the Federal
Parliament, was born at Botany Bay in
1880, groomed donkey-engines on Banana-
land mines for a few years, then went to
Darwin, where he became A.W.U. sec. and
chief exporter of disliked Government
officials. He was a big noise in the agita-
tion leading to the creation of the N.T. seat,
and did 28 days in Darwin Gaol, rather than
pay taxes without a chance of getting into
Parliament. Now he goes to his reward of
£lOOO a year, but, having no vote, he won’t
be wanted by any party, and will be ex-
pected to speak only on Territory matters,
like an angel in Heaven with a one-stringed
harp. Still, he has a shrewd head, and can
talk, so he may be able to make himself a
big enough nuisance to get something done
for the Territory.
Big TED THEODORE, Premier of Queens-
land, who is asking the electors to re-
turn him to power again.
Priminister Bill Massey, of Maoriland,
finished his 29th year of unbroken Parlia-
mentary service the other day, and his waist-
line suggests that the troubles thereof have
been taken philosophically.- Massey is the
Father of the present House, has had 11
years as Prime. Minister, and is now only
two years behind Seddon’s record.
Passed out at Goulburn (N.S.W.), aged
72, Archdeacon Bartlett, the second Anglican
cleric of the town to head for the pearly
gates within a week. The other was Canon
McDonnell, who went out to pneumonia at

lost Superioress-General Mother Mary
Borgia Mackay, of the amalgamated con-
vents of the Sisters of Mercy of Goulburn,
Albury and Yass.
Gone west, at 74, Dr. John Harris, of New-
castle (N.S.W.), about the best-known man in
the coal country, as he had been physician to
miners’ lodges all round the district. A
daughter, May, has a Glasgow diploma
(1895), and of late years assisted her dad.
Richard Harris, uncle of John, used to physic
Newcastle folk, but retired from practice
when his nephew got a footing, and there-
after for many years conducted a dispensary
in Watt-street.
James George Drake, Q. barrister, who has
his 73rd birthday on Apr! is a Londoner
who settled in Bananaland when he was
24. Eight years later, after newspaper re-
porting and Hansard work, he was called to
the Bar. He was a member of the first
Federal Senate, and held office as P.M.G.,
Min. for Defence and Attorney-General. Inci-
dentally, just one-half of the original Senate
have gone west. Exactly one-tmrd of that
House were lawyers, and eight of the 12 are
living. These survivors include Robert
Best (Vic.), Albert Gould, Josiah Symon
(S.A.), Keating and Clemons (Tas.), and
Justice Ewing (formerly W.A., now Speck).
Josiah Symon, one of the big men of the
bunch, is writing his reminiscences.

tors and Agency Co.
His signature is a bit
shaky, hut it serves.
Dow can still tell a
good yarn, but he is
not quite so bright as
he was 20 or
30 years ago,
when he told
Mark Twain
that it was
on account
o f reading
his books on
a g r iculture
that he lift
off minding
sheep to
come down
and edit the

section of

Twain’s
joyous comment was that he was never so
flattered by any compliment, but he couldn’t
help thinking what a fine thing the change
was for the sheep.
W. B. Oarr has been re-elected president
of the Stock Exchange of Adelaide for the
20th year—an Australian record. In his
pre-Exchange days be was sporting editor
of the Register. Every time lie has been
proposed by veteran J. B. Laurie, and this
year his seconder was Sydney Beach, who,
at 60, finds himself the only survivor of the
Exchange’s 50 original members of 1887.
Beach is a nephew of the late Chief Justice
Way, and dropped commerce when still young
to jump into the Broken Hill boom.
Addressed his last jury, Matthew John
Clarke, of Launceston (Tas.), Irish born
and 60 at the end. He used to be the Speck’s
best criminal lawyer, and a holy terror to
witnesses. In 1896 he was elected one of
the members for Launceston in the Assembly,
and was the youngest man in the Legislature.
He represented Tas. at the Federal Con-
ventions, in Adelaide, Sydney and Mel-
bourne. The Speck had the most youthful
and the oldest representatives at those
momentous gatherings—Adye Douglas was
the ancient.
Alderman and architect Frank Stapley,
ex-Gaud Mayor, has got his heart’s desire —
the chairmanship of Vic. Town Planning
Commission. He and his eight colleagues
have three years to suggest how Greater
Melbourne —22 cities, a couple of towns, a
brace of boroughs and slices of four shires —
can be improved. Of the nine commission-
ers, two-thirds are mediocrities, and the
others are not quite first-class ; but, given
a tip-top secretary, the commission may
manage to justify its existence.
Poor old Mrs. King, mother of Ned and
Dan Kelly, who died the other day, had a
characteristic funeral at Greta. The hearse
did not go oyer “Kelly’s Gap” to the house,
but the cotlin was carried out to a cart by
six grandsons, while two great-grandsons
bore seven lighted candles in front. Jim
Kelly, the son, drove the cart over the Gap
—the road over which he had brought his
dead sister Kate’s children years ago. (Long
afterwards one of them was killed in the
war.) At Greta West the hearse was wait-
ing, and the funeral brought mourners and
sympathisers from all parts of North-eastern
Victoria. The coffin-plate did not bear the
name of Kelly. It read : “Ellen King, died
March 27, 11)25, aged 95 years.”
If Irvine had been taken at his word in
19ul, he would probably never have become
Premier, Federal Attorney-General, State
Chief Justice, and Acting-Governor. Because
of the aloofness of his Conservative-Liberal
following after ex-Premier Allan McLean
went into the Federal arena, Irvine sent
his resignation as State Opposition leader
to E. H. Cameron, the Whip, because there
was nobody else to whom to address it. A
caucus of the party persuaded him to with-
draw his letter, and fealty was promised.
In the following year he ousted Peacock and
got the Premiership.
After the strenuous time he had on the
wooltops case as a Federal Law Department
officer, E. 11. Trebilco will find his new post
of Vie. Taxing-Master at £7OO a year no-
thing to strain his nerves. As managing
clerk to Iledderwick, Fookes and Alston, he
stacked up pretty well all there is to know
about Costs, and it will be easier for a fat
man to get through the eye of a camel than
it will be to get a point past Trebilco.
After drawing pension for 27 years W. G.
Brett, ex-inspector of Charities (Vic.), has
Signed his last receipt. Seventy years ago
he. got his first job in the service as deputy-
sheriff at Beechworth, later had 30 cosy
years as sheriff of the Northern Bailiwick,
and for the rest of his career, till 1896, was
Inspector-General of Prisons and Inspector
of Charities respectively. Even to very old
State officers he was but a memory.
Two ancients of Vic. Assembly, Joe Harris
and J. S. White, who have been out of the
House for 19 and 16 years respectively, were
up at the LaDds Department the other day
as Government representatives on the Fern-
tree Gully Park Committee. And they never
said a word about resigning, although one
is 83 and the other 81. Until a year or
two ago Harris looked after the horticulture
page of the Australasian.
“2641”: “Lou” says (B. 22/3/’23) that
Theodore wrested the then new Chillagoe
seat from Mick Woods. That’s not quite
right. Mick had represented Woothakata
for many years as a Kidstonite, but left the
party on the Kidston-Philp coalition in 1908
and sat as an Independent. For Wootha-
kata at the 1909 elections the candidates
were Theodore (Labor), Woods (Ind. Opp.)
and E. C. Earl (Ministerialist), and it was
only because half Earl’s supporters exer-
cised the contingent vote (optional) that
Theodore got in. By the 1912 elections the
Woothakata electorate had disappeared, giv-
ing place to Chillagoe, Eacham and Cook.
Theodore was returned for Chillagoe, Woods
being an “also ran” for Eacham, which was
captured by Gillies, the present Minister for
Agriculture. Woods now lives in Cairns,
and was turned down for the mayoralty in
1921.
When the oldsters “backed to Rutherglen”
(Vic.) the other day old dominie Buckley,
who opened the school there in ’6B. put
through their paces a class of his former
pupils, who unearthed an old-time waddy
for the occasion. Those who couldn’t wedge
into the desks sat on top of them, and after-
wards joined in a 40 yards footrace for
heavyweights only. R. Bye panted in first.
A protest at the scales was not sustained —•
be tipped the beam at 204 stone.
“The Deacon” William Mangan, who
banged the door of the R.C. Hall at Sand-
ringham (Vic.) in the faces of the Irish
disturbers the other day, is the smallest R.C.
priest in captivity. (When put under the
canonical measuring-stick he just made the
height.) Yet the clerical Hop o’ My
Thumb carries a punch where Australia
and Australians are concerned. Get-
ting his early training from the Jesuits
at Xavier College, he careered through
the Cardinal’s College, collected an M.A.
and final honors at the Melbourne
’Varsity, wrote a book or two, and saw two
years at the Front. Being one of those who
think that Australia should cut out its cleri-
cal importations, from archbishops down, he
was one of the heaviest supporters of the
Manly Old Boys’ Union, designed principally
with a view to correcting abuses, and has
been also its most enthusiastic president.
Seeing that Mannix, his immediate boss, has
to a certain extent tolerated O’Flanagan and
his fellow coat-trailer, there may yet be work
for the Manly Union.
“T.P.” on a millinery tragedy:—
A recent par. on George H. Wise reminds me that
in the days when the A.N.A. had less paunch and
more punch, there was a gorgeous public procession
in Ballarat. Solomon in all his glory wasn’t in it
with Oddfellows, Rechabites, Druids, Foresters,
Hibernians, etc., all blazing in regalia. We Natives
were massed around the fountain in Sturt-street when
a centurion with a brass hat and a semi-draught
horse pranced all over us, yelling: “Get to blithering
blazes out of this, you pudd’n’-headed asses.” A
thousand of us explained who we were —we could all
talk. Our oratory had no effect, till young Alec Peacock
laughed and whispered: “You dam’ idiot; we re
the A.N.A.” You could hear him down at the Buck s
Head. The marshal replied: “Well, how was I to
know? Why don’t you wear something to show what
you are?” We of the Buninyong branch were indig-
nant, arid at the next Conference our delegate moved:
GEORGE WASHINGTON WALKER, of
Lindley, Walker and Co., vice-president.
N.S.W. Chamber of Agriculture.
“That we wear a distinctive badge.” Youthful
George Wise seconded, and solemnly argued that we
should appear at public functions as Australian
natives, plus a loin circlet of gum-leaves. The Con-
ference howled with laughter, and went on with the
next business. I have never forgiven Wise, because,
but for him, I believe our Chief President to-day
.would be clad even as Alec Peacock is when he pre-
sides over the United Grand Lodge of Vic. Free-
masons in the absence of Stradbroke.
Natural history note on a strange bird: —
“Squizzy” Taylor, of Melbourne, is that rare
phenomenon, an advertising crook/ His professional
record is paltry. Yet he has earned a reputation
that one of the heads of the game might envy. As an
instance of how the spell works, he recently deserted
his wife —the same Angel Child who, when he struck
his last issue of trouble, was reported as being
willing to wait 10 years for him. Wife desertion
is an everyday affair with burglars, garrotters, forgers
and many others who never get a line of praise, or
a gleam of limelight from the press. Yet immedi-
ately “Squizzy” faced the Melbourne City Court
papers all over Australia flared with adulatory para-
graphs about his immaculate clothes and all the
rest of it. This sort of thing makes ill-feeling
amounting to bitterness amongst A.D.C.s (Federal: and
State), and the prevailing idea is that Mr. Taylor
should resign all his two-up schools and follow what
is clearly his natural bent, by becoming publicity
agent to a, vaudeville artiste.
Col. W. T. Reay goes back to London
next month. He will continue to look after
some of the Herald’s interests, and will
resume his association with the special con-
stabulary- Reay, who looks his 62 years,
threw up the editorship of Hamilton Spec-
tator 30 years ago to join the late lamented
Daily Telegraph, and then the Herald,
which was at that time temporarily in the
hands of the McKinley crowd, plus Parson
Fitchett. His first public recognition came
when he went to London in charge of the
military contingent sent at the time of the
old Queen’s Diamond Jubilee; then he be-
came a member of the Leg. Assembly and
general manager of the Herald. London
gripped him 13 years ago and held him.
Now it is getting him again.
Sam Jacobs, chairman of the S.A. Brew-
ing Co., had his 70th anniversary on the day
of the co.’s 70th meeting. It was started in
1888 by the amalgamation of the Kent Town
(ID. T. Smith) and West End (W. K.
Simms) breweries. Jacobs, who chased
Costs before he took to commerce, is chair-
man also of the Castle Salt and other cos.,
presides over Bowls in S. Aus., is on the
committee 'of the S.A. Jockey Club, and
lias presided over both Tattersall’s Club and
the finance committee of Adelaide ’Varsity.
Magnificent McCall, Clerk of Vic.’s Upper
House, is 64> and due to retire this year
if the Dreary Chamber will let him. He is
so used to its ways—he has quite dimmed
the Jenkins light—-that he can pull it out of
any tangle. Newton, Clerk of the other
place and of the Parliament to boot, is also
looking forward to the leisure years, being
about 63. Pearson, of the Council, is over
60; one or two other seniors of the staffs
of, the two Houses are close up to three-
score, and understudies are not always in
sight.
THE LAUGHING-STOCK.
[FOR THEB BLLETIN.]
“The main objection of the Sydney Water Board to
Diggers was that they laughed and joked with the
cleaners.” — Mr. Lipscomb, general secretary of the
R.S.L.
I rendezvooed and joined the mob
Who went to stoush the bloomin’ ’Un;
The big pots promised me a job
When all the dirty work was done.
“Hark, laddie, to the bugle call!”
Their voices shook with pride and fright;
“It is your duty. After all,
We’ll stick to you and see you right.
“Your country needs you. That must thrill
Your patriotic heart with joy.
Your glorious destiny fulfil—
Quick march, and win the war, my boy!”
They kidded me. I donned a pack.
And took a rifle in my hand.
A cushie job when I got back?
My possie’s in the George-street band.
“Our hope and pride! You’ll know no fear.
You’ll laugh at all the stress of battle”- -
To-day they give a shameless sneer
When the collection-boxes rattle.
“Don’t hesitate ! The hour has struck !
Immortal glory you’ll attain!”
Immortal glory? Out of luck
And dossing in the wide Domain!

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“S.S.” : Some months ago a small par. of
mine re snakes and youngsters started a long con-
troversy in which the balance of evidence
seemed to prove that snakes do not bite
kiddies whose baby handling could not possibly
hurt them. Anyhow, here is one more incident, hot
GIVE MOTHER A HAND.
PPRTER: “ Carry your luggage, sir?"
DAD: “Er —no thanks. I can look after
that myself. But yer can take the baby
off the missus's hands."
from the happening, that may close the wordy war-
fare. While I was staying with my daughter at
Tambourine last week, her year-old son was left in
his cot on the verandah for a few minutes, and when
the mother picked him up there was a black snake
all mixed up with the little Chap’s arms and legs.
I lifted the child by his clothes, shook him and the
snake dropped. If was killed a little later, and its
skin, now drying on a mulberry-tree, measures 6ft.
6in. My daughter was convinced that the child
was bitten, and persuaded me to drive them to the
nearest chemist 14 miles away. The chemist could
see nothing wrong and the youngster was happy
and hungry ; but a torrent of feminine argument was
launched and I drove them a further 20 miles to
a doctor, only to learn that the kiddie was quite
all right. But the medico told us a story. “I had
a carpet-snake in my stable to keep down the mice,”
he said, “and one day my nipper of three and a
half years brought it into the house with a mouse
in its mouth, the couple of yards of snake waggling
round the youngster’s legs. I killed the thing after
that —it’s madness to take chances —but my experi-
ence is that snakes do not bite young children.”
And that’s mine too —and I’ve had a lot of it.
* * * t
“Jim Carew”: Has any Abo. ever come
across a woman who could really shear? I have met
many who in an emergency could “tomahawk” the
wool off the sheep; but I’ve met only one expert.
She was the wife of a Westralian farmer-shearer,
who ran about 500 woollies as a side-line. Every
year, while her husband was following the sheds,
she would “barber” their own flock, putting them
through usually in 8 or 10 days.
* » * *
“Herodot”: Some weeks ago, in the
Northern Rivers district (N.S.W.), a cow became so
bad with a painful but mysterious illness that the
owner shot her to put her out of her misery. A
post-mortem examination revealed the presence in
the alimentary tract of a large live frog, which
seemed to be quite at home in its unusual surround-
ings, while the tissues around the spot were con-
siderably ulcerated, and there was an extensive
inflammation of the neighboring areas. In all pro-
bability the frog, an ordinary rana communis, had
been taken in with water as a tadpole, or in the
preceding stage, and had grown in the cow’s
viscera. The discovery suggests the disconcerting
query: If this could happen to a cow, what’s to
prevent a man being inadvertently turned into a
frog-farm ?
* * * *
“Gulliver”: Why has a bullock invariably
longer horns than a bull? I have asked this ques-
tion of many cattlemen, and none could offer an
explanation. I’m waiting to hear. No; they’re not
worn short with fighting.
* * * *
“Spenner”: For years parrots have been
destroying more than half rfiy apple crop. This
year Joey has deserted the orchard for a patch of
cow-kale which has run to seed in the adjoining pad-
dock. The transfer satisfies me in every respect.
I fed my milkers from the kale all last winter; have
had a record crop of apples this season; and ammuni-
tion .exes, have been nil. The tip might be of value
to other orchardists.
* * * *
“FY7”: The “eaglehawk” with a blue
body that “The Rumpus” collected in Westralia (B.
5/4/’23) was probably the blue falcon. The name
“eaglehawk” is applied by Australians to the wedge-
tailed eagle—giant of all the world’s eagles. This
lordly fowl is no “chicken-snatcher” like “The R’s”
friend, and deserves more respect for his dignity than
is implied in the par. referred to. How would “The
Rumpus” like to be casually referred to as a poli-
tician?
* * » *
“Centre”: I saw a small brown hawk
hovering for a considerable
time above a clump of bents
on the sand dunes near our
place, and finally swoop. The
bird was up again in an instant
with a full-sized rat in its claws.
When about 50ft. in the air the
bird released its grip, and the rat
dropped to earth with a crash.
The hawk was on it again
almost as soon as it touched
the ground, and again took
it aloft, only to drop it once
more. Four times was that rodent
dropped from 50ft. or 60ft. before
the bird gave it the k.o. on the
sand. My mate declared that the
hawk was playing with the rat
after the manner of a cat, but my
suggestion is that the bird was
imitating the laughing-jackass,
having seen that worthy doing the
same stunt with a snake. It was
rough on the rat either way, but —who’s right?
“The Stranger”: If “George R.” (B.
15/3/’23) should stray into the Railway Hotel,
Temuka (M.L.), he will see, in a glass case at the
head of the stairs, the stuffed remains of a grey-
hound which killed 58 sheep in one night. A judge,
12 men, some of them good and true, and a couple
of wise men wrangled for four days; and the upshot
was that the owner of the dog had to pay £2OO and
destroy the hound. Rover wasn’t caught in the act,
but the evidence against him was very black. He
forgot to have a wash after the fray, and also cut
one of his feet on one of the broken bottles that lie
around the paddocks of Temuka, and, to make matters
wore, the ground was soft -where he put up the
record, and thus yielded evidence that no other tyke
went into the paddock to have a sniff around.

“Vanikoro”: One habit of some of the
Papuans of Dutch New Guinea, as described by W.
F. Alder in his “Isle of Vanishing Men,” has curious
classical and modern analogies. In the hands of
some of the theorists it might be used to trace the
origin of the Papuans back to Constantinople or
thereabouts. Alder says that when a Kia-Ivia wants
a drink he simply throws back his head, opens his
gullet, and, without swallowing, lets the liquid
go down in one continuous stream. Alder mistakenly
supposes that operation to be peculiar to the Papu-
ans; but, as Frere pointed out long ago in a note
on Aristophanes, who mentions the custom, it was
common among the ancient Thracians who dwelt in
what is now Turkey-in-Europe, Bulgaria and there-
abouts. It is also practised, Frere says, by the
Catalonians in the north-east of Spain. As Frere
lived a good deal in Spain he ought to know. Maybe
some Catalonian Jews got as far as Papua when
they were expelled from Spain, and brought the
custom with them. This hypothesis has the merit
of also accounting for the hooked noses ard Jewish
features so common among some tribes of Papuans.
* * * *
“El Dorado” : At Mrs. Menzies’s orchard, a
few miles from Dubbo (N.S.W.), a wagtail built his
abode of love on a single strand of fenring-wire
stretched between the verandah posts. It would
have made Blondin scratch his head if he had seen
it. The nest was perfectly balanced and beautifully
moulded.
“W.D.G.”: The other day I found a kan-
garoo caught in a wire fence, and just dead. In
the pouch were three young ’roos. Two small ones
each had a comforter in its mouth, while the largest
one seemed to be without rations. Isn’t three a
bit sudden?
“Parama”: What’s the strength of the
“breeding-pearl” ? Throughout the Malay Archi-
pelago the belief holds that,
if a few specially-selected
pearls are sealed up in a box
or bottle with a few grains
of rice for nourishment, they
will increase in size. (Some
say in number, too.) The
matter was tested years ago
by the curator of the Singa-
pore Museum, and he seemed
to suggest that there was a
germ of truth in the idea.
The belief extends to Japan
and Borneo, and more than
one white man on Thirsty
Island has a mysterious little
sealed box in which several
“breeding-pearls” and a few
grains of rice are wrapped
in raw cotton. Some of the
fishermen in Borneo keep every
ninth pear] they find, regard-
less of shape and size. They
carry them in either a bottle
or a bamboo tube, and in both
cases use as a cork the finger
of a dead man. It was re-
ported some years back by
Professor Kimmerlv that every
grave along the coast of Bor-
neo had been broken) into
and the fingers of the dead
men taken lor corks for these
“breeding-pearl’" bottles. In
all eases rice is used as a
food for the pearls. The
same idea holds with regard
to fresh-water pearls, there
being believers in Scotland,
Sweden and the U.S.A. I’ve
never been able to hang on to pearls long
enough to see if they want to breed or not up
in Torres Strait, but if anyone in the Council can
vouch for it, I’m ready to impound a few good ones
for a couple of years just to give it a fly.
“Centurion”: “D.F.” (B. 5/4/’23) asks
who the man was who invented “the modern” way
of working bullocks. The answer is lost in the mists
of antiquity. The yoke gear is older than the day
when Noah drove a span of bulls (no bullocks in
those economical times) into the ark. Assyrian,
Babylonian and ancient Asiatic sculpture of all lands
shows the yoked cattle drawing anything from
chariots to water. Cattle have worked in the yoke
in Egypt since the time of Anubis. In Sussex, the
local red cattle have been used for ploughing and
dragging poled waggons since the day of the Domes-
day Book. An argument against the tradition quoted
by “D.F.” that the pole was invented at Dapto
(N.S.W.) ia that the Boers use the pole waggon,
though their bows are greenhide rimpis and their
keys made of wood—and this type of bullock-team
fitting was in use at the Cape long before Dapto
was heard of.
* * * *
“H.E.R.”: A snake killed at Beverley
(W.A.) was a few inches off 6ft. long and had no
greater bulk than an ordinary stockwhip. Five
inches of its intelligence end was coal-black and
glossy, but the balance of its body was sunflower
yellow, merging into pure white underneath. When
its head was smashed, instead of doing the usual
contortions, it coiled tail first around the stem of a
small stinkwood. Can any Abo. give it. a name?

rays beaming through the skylight on to some bag’s,
placed underneath to protect shearers when at work
in a woolshed at Merigal, in the Warren (N.S.W.)
district, recently was the cause of the shed being
destroyed by fire. At an office here in N.Q., a wash-
bottle,»used in wet assaying was, when not in use,
put aside on a small table near an open door. The
table is scorched black on the surface, and it was
some months before the cause was found out. The
sun, at about 4 p.m., shone on to this bottle, which

was usually full of water, with the result that the
rays were concentrated on to the table through it,
as through a lens. The table never ea'ughi

rays would make the wood smoke and char. [And
you don’t have to get as far into the tropics as
Herberton to procure the same results. There is
a table in The Bulletin office in Sydney similarly
charred.— Sub-Editor.]
“El Dorado”: I was shown a gruesome
curiosity the other day—-a bullock’s skull with a
chain embedded in the bone. Could anything more
hellish be imagined than what that poor beast must
have suffered as it grew up ?
* * * *
“D.F.”: Instead of worrying about Pata-
gonia, searchers for prehistoric survivals might try the
still little-known south-west corner of Maoriland. In
1831 the sealing gangs of the Sydney Packet, so
they said after they got back to Port Jackson, saw
an “extraordinary animal of the kangaroo species”
at Dusky Sound. The beast was standing on its
hind legs nibbling at the trees. It stood at least
30ft., allowing sft. for the tail, which was dragging
on the ground. This estimate they checked later by
measuring the height of the branches on which it
had been browsing. When the freak saw the sealers
it jumped 20 yards at the first bound, dived into
the water, and went off down the Sound at a rattling
pace.
* * * »
“Sucre” : I can also tell “The Deacon”
(B. 22/3/’23) that there are horses that can’t swim.
I put a grey mare to the Condamine at Warwick
(S.Q.) ; but when she found she couldn’t touch
bottom she struggled fiercely and went down in
15ft. of water. She is still there.
* * * *
“Pick”: The fish described by “How’s
That (B. 29/3/’23) sounds like the wobbegong, a
horror that is often wrongly named tiger-shark. He
grows to 8 or 9 feet, is brownish with irregular darker
blotches, and always carries an overfed appearance
amidships. His upper lips are fringed with worm-
like appendages, which, drifting to and fro in the
water, excite the curiosity of sweep and other small
fish until they venture within range of the open
cavernous jaws ready to snap them. The wobby nas
no apparent sense of feeling, and after a junk of his
face has been torn off by a shark-hook, he will again
immediately attack the bait. When landed he will
feign death, and will hot quiver if huge baits are
cut away from his fleshy sides; but if anyone fools
about his head or steps near his nose, he will give
a sudden snap with devilish ferocity. And when
he gets a hold only severing the angle of his jaws
will release the grip.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: Travelling through the
gypsum-lake country in Westralia, where the summer
heat runs to 110 u , I came upon a well filled with
clear water. I was tempted to drink, but an old
cocky warned me not to. The crystal liquid was
ice-cold, and I suggested that it should make an
excellent bath after a hard day’s toil. Again I was
told not to. I plunged my hand in to find the
reason, and a few minutes later my fingers weie
so stuck together that I had to use force to separate
them.

Introduce the Wonderful Cornstalk Lamp
For Cottage or Mansion.
Specially Adapted for Country Homes.
Makes and burns its own gas. As you hold the
lighted match beneath the generator a few seconds,
gas is generated from the kerosene or petrol used
as fuel. Only 4 per cent, of fuel is consumed with
96 per cent, of air; thus it is wonderfully economical
to use.
Dependable as daylight, in marked contrast to the
yellowish glare of ordinary lamps.

“Ned Kelly”: Re the.prejudice against the
catfish as tucker (B. 5/4/’23). I don’t know’ how the
yarn originated, but thousands of backblockers firmly
believe that the head of the catfish is poisonous.
Probably this explains why Whiskers is so seldom
eaten.
* * * *
“Ento” : I can give a wrinkle to “Winkle”
re blowfly biology which seems to be bothering him
(B. 5/4/’23). These insects breed two sexes of about
equal numbei’s, but the swains die young. Between
the eyes of the female are two pairs of bristles that
are missing on her spouse; and on the male the
eyes are closer together, if not contiguous. During
the last year I have beeir breeding blowflies by the
thousand for purposes of scientific research, and I
envy “Winkle,” whose luck allows him to find a
superabundance of gravid females, for I get only
one in 20 depositing during a real good (or bad)
season, and one in 200 during a spell of lowest
temperature would be a delightful find.
* * * *
“Faceplate”: The snakes I have met (in
the bush) have generally been great lovers of the
music of a well-swung crosscut saw; but I never
found one so keen as to take such a front seat as
“Biri’e Gui'ra’s” (B. 5/4/’23). However, the cir-
cular saws proved an irresistible attraction to them
during their walk-about season, and more than one
paid for it in the spot-mill where I once worked
(Otway, Vic.). Timber jerkers dislike even the artis-
tically inclined tiger-snake when he gets under their
feet, and he is an easy kill when under the influence
of the saws. Another Freud, I put a sexual con-
struction on that influence. I don’t know that snakes
do have any mating call, but it was the rapt, bald-
head look in their eyes that gave me the idea.
* * * *
“Ento”: I, too, once discovered an ant
colony of the “bombardier” persuasion. These
creatures acted somewhat after the manner narrated
by “N.K.C.” (B. 5/4/’23). But his description of
them putting their tail between their legs and firing
forwards is too realistic to sound genuine. My ants
fired rearwards.

“J.A.”: I used to think that if parent
birds were allowed access to caged young ones they
would treat them as if in the nest. I don’t know. A
friend robbed a blackbird’s nest of its solitary nest-

ling and placed ft in a cage under the verandah. The
parent birds became very concerned, and openly sfeowed
their disapproval but a Jittle later the mother bird
began to carry food to the captive. On the follow-
imr day the young- bird died and the parents dis-
appeared. When cleaning the cage subsequently
mv friend found two berries of the deadly nightshade
variety. Murder, or merely coincidence?

“Curlew” (W.A.) : For the last 50 years.
to my knowledge, there
have been at intervals gen-
eral prayers for rain in
Australia, and in England
they have occasionally
varied the monotony by
prayers for fine weather in
harvest time ; but these pro-
ceedings never seem to have
any effect on the weather.
So it has occurred to me
that a hopeful experiment
which has never been tried
would be for a few thou-
sand people to meet and
solemnly cuss the weather.
A committee might be ap-
pointed of, say, three
master-mariners and three
bullock-drivers to draw up
a litany for the service,
with suitable responses for
the audience. The effect
would be very striking,
even if unsuccessful. Hav-
ing been droving for many
years, I could draw’ up
a litany myself which, I
may say, with all modesty,
would not be discreditable
to anyone; on the other
hand., I have heard at
least one captain 1 iof a
windjammer, and more
than one bulloeky, before
whose flow of simple, force-
ful language I have stood
bareheaded. P.S. —Since
writing the above it has
started to rain like —well,
the best we’ve had for six
months. Perhaps the mere
contemplation of the course
I suggest has been help-
ful. f

“Ragar”: The crocodile does like its food
ripe and soft as “Masi” says (B. 5/4/’2S), and, though
spreading the meal out on the sand to ripen is a,
new •' one' to me, I’ve seen bodies recovered that
Silurians had : buried in the thick heavy mud at the
bottom of the river; also from under submerged
tree-ttunks, where they had evidently been, pushed
with an idea of keeping them until sufficiently' high
for eating. Both alligator and croc, kill their
victims by drowning. Should a catch be made in
open water—the sea or a lagoon, for instance —the
prey -is carried between the brute’s punishing jaws
to where there is a suitable larder in which to place
it. Fresh meat doesn’t appeal at any time. After
a catch has been buried the ’gator or croc, hangs
around and keeps an eye on it, for there’s no sucn
thing as “honor among thieves” with these gentry,
and a hungry saurian would pinch a ripening meal
belonging to his own mother.
* * * *
“Betterave”; Many bushmen bold that
when a snake has its jaws extended by a meal to
anywhere near their full capacity there is only one
way for that meal to go—straight ahead. I’ve seen
that idea disproved by a carpet-snake taping
14ft. 9in. When discovered he was in the act of
getting outside a well-constricted wallaby, estimated
to weigh 401 b. The feed had progressed until the
head, shoulders and part of the body had disappeared.
The snake seemed; to pull itself , on to the wallaby
as much as pull the wallaby in. At the rpte they
were both travelling it seemed a full hour would be
taken to finish the meal ; but, wanting to test the
one-way idea, I interrupted things with two solid
whacks on the wriggler amidships—and the way it
backed off its tucker put the thing very much beyond
doubt.

“Alkaloid”: The Pharmacopoeia is already

doubtful value; sc>. why start collectihg additional

copaiba, sandalwood and all the otrier stand-bys
have long been relegated to the oblivion of the
inept, and Binghi’s “find” would have to compete
with the modern silver-salts treatment. Also, why.

“Pat Busliie”: While working in gar-
den I saw a blood-red fly, about the sizp of a
blue-bottle, buzzing round. When it alighfjed and
I had a close, Ipok, I found its wings were light
yellow; otherwise it looked like an ordinary fly.
Is it a freak, or what?
“Sirdar”: My nomination for the Plum
Pudding Shield (B. 29/3/’23) is one of the “roly-
poly” breed, built by. Bill Lyall and staff on the
occasion of the opening of the new pub at Little
River, Ensav (Vic.). This duff was Bft. long and
2ft. Sin. through, was boiled for 24 hours in an
upright position in an old cylinder, and when rolled
out of its tarpaulin jacket looked like a huge
newly-barked straining-post. The breaking-down
process was accomplished by a double-ended crosscut
saw, with George Duggan on one end and my dad
on the other—both well sprung.

“L. Le Dam” : One more queer accident.
At Tabulaih (N.S.W.) two abos. were detailed to
watch the end of a race while stock were being
yarded. In the midst of the dust and sweat and
cursing, one old bullock broke from the yards and
charged ; down the race. The abos. waited one on
each side of the gate, and, as the animal dashed up,
one of them landed him a woodener on the forehead
with an outsize in clubs. A splinter from the
weapon flew off and up the nostril, of the smiter’s
mate, who was rendered unconscious immediately
and died in less than an hour.

“xV.R.” : In the Sheffield (Tas.) district

nate woman in hospital, and the leg had to be ampu-
tated. Has anyone heard of a similar case?
‘‘Pat Bushie” : Starlings selected my home
as a nesting-place this summer, and several times
I rooted the nests out, because of the lousy repu-
tation of the birds* The little red lice from the
birds became troublesome, so I fumigated the house.
A couple of days ago, when throwing out a sheet
of tanglefoot, thoroughly covered with flies, I noticed
some of the half-dead flies had the tiny red lice
on them. I set a fresh sheet, and on one of the
victims found seven of the little parasites. Several
local residents to whom I showed it expressed great
surprise, so I turn it over to the Council for con-
sideration and' report.

“Digger”: As an aeroplane spotter in
France the horse beat the Digger pointless. 'The pre-
liminary to a Gotha coming over our lines at night
was the projection of a searchlight beam skywards,
and all spotters were immediately on the qui vine;
but long before the human eye could detect Fritz,
the artillery prad, by his uneasiness and low whinny-
ing appeals for comradeship, gave faithful evidence
of the nearness of the bomb-dropper. The donk was
the equal of the horse in this peculiar sensing
quality, aud later bn it was noticed frequently that
neither animal was affected by the drone of a
Handley Page.

“Exul’s” little problem :
The experts at the 1 Electrolytic Zinc Works, at

on it. The sulphuric acid is stored in strong iron
drums, and one of these had been emptied and the

the top off, with an oxy-acetylene blowpipe so that the
drum ecrtfld be converted to other use. As soon as
the flaiile 5 bit through there was a terrific explosion,
and the top of the drum was blown through ■ the iron
rpof 30ft. above. Is it possible that the air could
have contained enough water vapor to dilute the
traces of acid left so that it acted on the iron, thus
giving off hydrogen, which formed an explosive mix-
ture with the oxygen present from the air? That
is an explanation, but it doesn’t seem to account for
the violence of the bang.

Of opal shadows that your sunsets drown
And the blue haze that hangs above the town?
Please, April, give us back our mud again!

OBJECTS.
The Company is being formed, inter alia, to take over as from the
Ist January, 1923, and expand the well-known Structural Steel and
Engineering Business now carried on by Luke Muras Pty., Ltd., at
Waterloo, Sydney, which was established and successfully conducted by
the late Luke Muras for 32 years, and during the past five years by the
present company. In the reconstruction now contemplated the Directors
propose, as a primary object, the enlargement of the already up-to-date
plant, to enable extensive business offering, which is at present beyond
the scope of the works, to be undertaken.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association, which will be pre-
pared in accordance with the Stock Exchange Regulations, will give the
Directors wide discretionary powers to engage in such work as they
consider the Company may advantageously undertake.
VALUATIONS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITY.
The new Company will take over the following Assets and Liability
from the Vendor Company: —
ASSETS.
Land (valued by Richardson & Wrench, Ltd.),
Buildings, Machinery, Tools, and Stock
(valued by Messrs. H. E. Ross & Rowe),
Office Furniture and Fittings, and Goodwill £68,014 0 0

ing outstanding cheques .. . . . • 4,464 17 7
Surplus of Assets over Liability to be taken over

Disregarding Goodwill, the net Assets (less Vendors’ Cash Con-
sideration) after receipt of the new capital will be equal to a cover of
nearly £2 Is. 6d. per £ of Preference Capital.
The Vendor Company will collect and retain all Accounts due to
them at 31st December, 1922, out of which they will discharge all Lia-
bilities at that date, excepting the Bank Overdraft, responsibility for
which the new Company assumes.

dend.
AUDITORS’ REPORT ON ESTIMATED PROFITS.
The Directors, Messrs. LUKE MURAS PTY., LTD., Waterloo.
Dear Sirs, —In accordance with instructions we now hand you our
detailed estimate of the expenditure required to deal with- a turnover of
£150,000 per annum. We are not in a position to offer any opinion
upon this figure, but, having been connected with your Company for
several years, are satisfied that the business is well managed, and that ill
estimating the turnover Mr. Luke Muras has considered all factors, and
reliance may be placed upon his judgment and intimate knowledge of
the trade.
The Gross Profit, which has been calculated at 16 per cent., is, in our
opinion, conservative in a business of this nature, and is less than the
percentage earned, during the five years of your Company’s operations.
As regards the expenditure, we consider that the actual payments
should be well covered ,by the estimated figures, and that on sales of
£150,000 a. Net Profit of at least £16,000 should result. —Yours, faith-
fully, PETERSON and RALPH KING, Fs.C.P.A.
HISTORY OF THE VENDOR COMPANY.
Started in a small way 36 years ago, the business has progressed
and has earned substantial profits all the time. Since its formation
into a limited company it has paid at least 10 per cent, per annum,
and during the years 1920 and 1921 the dividends were 20 per cent, per
annum (no dividend has yet been declared for 1922, but the profits would
allow of a very handsome distribution being made). In addition to this,
the conservative policy adopted has enabled the Company to expand and
develop on proper lines. The sound progress made is evidence of the
efficient control exercised by the late Mr. Luke Muras and his sons, the
present Directors.
WORK IN HAND.
The Vendor Company is now engaged upon contracts and orders
sufficient to keep the present works fully occupied for several months.
MANAGEMENT.
The management is in the hands of Messrs. J., L. and S. Muras, who
have been in the business about 20 years, and who were trained by their
father (the late Mr. Luke Muras) in every department, and are thor-
oughly qualified as designing and practical engineers, to undertake and
efficiently carry out the work on the larger scale proposed. As these
Directors are not only conversant with their own particular department,
but also with the other departments of the business, continuity of sound
and experienced management is assured. Each of these three gentlemen
has agreed to serve for a term of five (5) years at salaries and commis-
sion, as stated in the contract dated 3rd March, 1923, mentioned here-
after, with a provision that if' all or any of them leave the Company’s
employ they or he shall not: commence of in any way directly or indirectly
engage in a similar business v in Sydney for three years from date of
leaving the Company’s employ. ,
Extracts from Report by HERBERT E. ROSS, Esq., F.I.A.
(Messrs. H. E. ROSS & ROWE, Architects).
The continued and increasing use of steel for construction should
justify the proper capitalisation of this business.
The Stock Yards, as planned, would enable quick and economical
handling of material.
The prospects of trade in the future appear to be excellent, and,
speaking from experience of the past, wherein the present proprietary has
carried numerous steel contracts under the writer’s designs and for his
clients, we have great confidence that the management will successfully
deal with any volume of trade which may reach the Works, and experi-
ence has shown .from tenders received in competition in the past that
the firm could always hold its own in this respect.
The writer should also add that the reputation held by the firm from
personal knowledge of the building trades has always been excellent. The
reputation which it takes to acquire we have every reason to believe will
be fully sustained.
The prospects also are good, inasmuch as an extensive building pro-
gramme is, in the writer’s opinion, imminent in this State, a programme
in which the more general use of steel will appear than has been in the
past.

St. Vincent’s Ball revolved in almost
stately ease at the Town Hall, so lightweight
was the attendance of jazzers. The gal-
leries, however, were well filled, and as
hundreds of people had bought tickets who
were unable to claim their foothold, the funds
are expected to overflow the thousand mark
—this early-season venture expects always
to do that much for the big Darlinghurst
hospital. Decorations ran largely to flags,
but there were happy little interludes of
green palms and rosy garlands, the handi-
work of a patient from the Hospice for the
Dying.
Posters were the feature of the evening,
and the judging thereof —a prolonged affair
—cast a gloom over the early part of tne
jazzers’ evening. Black Cat Souter ran
the tape, as it were, over the competing cos-
tumes, and decided in favor of a slim Per-
sian beauty in apple-green who advertised
her pet bath soap. An effective Lady Mary
Carlisle outfit won a bauble for Nancy Pass-
more, who told the world about a face pow-
der. Josephine Marks, one of the hospital’s
greatest friends, won an honorable mention.
A model Mark Foy’s on the head of Mrs.
Slattery was ranked as the most original,
although the lad and lass who represented
the toothsome “life-saver” were a beautifully-
got-up pair. The Egerton couple, he in
Celestial garb that might have been nipped
from the Lowder Collection, she a lass
from Araby, were among the successful cos-
tume wearers. Others who took the eye
and the floor were Mrs. Mueller, Mary
Hughes and a bunch of pretty nurses from
the hospital; and a willow-wand colleen, all
frills and crinoline, with a tiny frilled berthe
falling early-Victorian wise over her tight
green bodice, represented the Freeman’s
Journal. Crown Prosecutor Coyle’s Margot
looked as fragrant as the eau-de-Cologne she
depicted.
The newly-returned Sheldon dame, in
mauve and silver brocade, brought the girls.
Tootles Williamson hostessed a party of 12.
The new Naval Commander Craufurds
were the big fish of an evening bereft of
vice-regality: she bore black and henna
brocade with distinction, and as they danced
he bore the tickling of her 3ft. 2-plume fan
with* fortitude. Mrs. A. E. Hughes floated
as aloof as a sunset cloud in a rose du Barry
confection. A lorffe skirt, consisting of layers
of infinitesimal mauve frills that led up to
a silver tissue bodice, clad half-time
aide D’Apice’s lady; and Mrs. Bertie Kelly,
in velvet that glowed like any rajah’s ruby,
took on the job of passing the debs, through
the portals of Society by a gracious hand-
shake and an encouraging word. The debs.,
poor ducklings, were too stunned to ask
“Whaffor?” Where is this presentation farce
to end, and wasn’t there anybody on all the
big committee with a sufficient glimmer of
humor to stop an absurdity that sent the
galleryites into gusts of laughter?
The G.-G.’s lady still spreads her vice-
regal wing over the Crown-street Women’s
Hospital, and has called a meeting at Admi-
ralty House on the 26th to hatch a ball on
the Ceramic in aid of the institution.
Roy Agnew’s admirers, shepherded by
secretaries Ruth Barton and Ruth Beale
(Ruth’s a good name for a gleaner), sat in
conclave in the Carlton drawing-room mid-
way through last week. Mrs. Alex. Gordon,
frocked in Quaker brown, was in the chair,
and the big room purred with well-bred en-
thusiasm over the effort to send a real Austra-
lian composer to the Old World to show them
the brand of genius we grow here. Roy
came into the meeting when the business
part was at an end, and was bombarded
with hand-clapping, which made the nervous
young man grow a shade whiter, if that
were possible. A small pupil of Ruth
Barton’s played Roy’s “Dance of the Wild
Men,” but through excitement took the
measure too slowly—till one could fancy the
Wild Men were making a minuet of it.
There’s to be a testimonial concert in a few
weeks’ time.
Dr. Olive Dalyell had hardly taken the
pins out of her hat before she began battling
for baby. At the Education Building last week
the clever young woman, whose research work
during and since the war has added another
gram or two to Science’s store, told the
story of Welfare Work in Europe, and illus-
trated it with some interesting but heart-
searing lantern-slides. The Royal Wei-
fare Society spread its wing over the gather-
ing, which packed the lecture hall. Dr.
Olive, who took her degrees at Sydney Uni.,
had an ovation which made that austere
building raise its eyebrows.
Tenor Walter Kirby was the lion of Mrs.
William Arnott’s party at the National Club
last week; and at the singer’s luscious notes
the long room, blooming with early-autumn
millinery and yellow chrysanthemums, purred
like a cat over a saucer of cream. Walter
poured out the evergreen “La Boheme,” and
some haunting morsels in plain English that
brought a pensive look to the eye of the
guests, mostly young matrons, gathered
about the teacups. The afternoon was
heavily gilded with the local peerage, and
Harry Lauder’s lady was added to the srlit-
tering collection. Clever Edyth Harrhy
sang some of her own compositions, and
Mrs. McCoy and the hostess added a song
apiece to the musical brew.
Walter Kirby is giving his first recital in
Sydney next month. It is only by the merest
accident he isn’t on his way to sing at Mary
Bowes Lyon’s marriage to the Duke of YorK.
The bride’s aunt, Lady Anne Bowes Lyou,
invited him to go across and raise his voice
in melody while the register was being signed
—she was Walter’s fairy godmother when he
was a student in England. After hearing
him sing at the house of Sir George Newnes
she wanted to send him to Italy, and, later
on, she, Lady Wantage and Lady Methuen
smoothed the path of the young tenor, and
introduced.him to a circle of minor royalties.
The Strathmores have always been passion-
ately fond of music, and when young boys
the uncles of Lady Mary often entertained
father’s guests by their beautifully-balanced
part-singing. Mrs. Gladstone mentions in
her Memoirs that even her G.O.M. —who,
apparently, was no music-lover —listened to
the lads not only with interest but with
delight.
Gaud Mayor Gilpin’s lady made her debut to
glean a harvest of linen for the Crown-street
Women’s Hospital; and, judging by the snowy
pyramids on the tables inside the doorway,
the old-established institution will be able to
re-dress its beds and towel racks three or
four times a day, if it feels inclined. Secre-
tary Mona Daly, smiling over a high squirrel
collar, murmured something about having
£4O in cash for the same Cause. The new
Mayoral lady showed a pleasant face lighted
with deep-set thoughtful eyes, and held a
gaudy Mary-Pumpkin bag against the sob-
riety of her own mole-clad silkiness. Her
miniature bouquet, too, was a thing to marvel
at —mauve carnations and tiny orchids. The
Waley lady, who created, christened and
chaperoned the vampish Mary Pumpkin to
swell the funds of the hospital, was in smart
grey suiting ■ and black millinery. Margaret
Windeyer, who arrived staggering under an
armful of linen, has a special interest in
Crowm-street,' for it was her mother who
with Sister Macleod pioneered the Better
Babies movement. Mauve-clad nurses
handed out tea.
Herewith May Moore’s picture of Rieke
Parker, who gives her first Sydney recital
on May 3 at
the Conserva-
torium. Rieke,
who studied
for some years
i n Germany
and America,
has been
working with
Doris Barnett
in Sydney in
preparation for
her introduc-
tion to Har-
bor City audi-
ences. Her
father was
Erskine Par-
ker, of Laun-
ceston, and
one sister is
brilliant pian-
ist Kitty Par-
ker, who, it
will be remem-
bered, played the accompaniments for her
husband, Hubert Eisdell, when that famous
gramophone tenor sang in Sydney about two
years ago. ißieke’s own work is brilliant,
poetic and fluent.
Kathleen Robinson, who has been starring
in the Varna Repertory Co.’s “Scarlet Pim-
pernel” at the King’s Hall, belongs to back
o’ Bourke. Mother is a niece of Samuel
McCaughey, and Kathleen and she are perch-
ing for the moment in Sydney after about
three years’ travelling abroad. Kathleen is
badly stage-struck, and is shaping well for
the career she intends to follow. On the
opening night the audience consisted mainly
of the star’s friends, among them large bat-
talions of the Fairfaxes. But the play, which
is dressed with wigs and hoops and patches,
over-balanced the tiny stage entirely, and
there were horrible moments when one felt
the action must topple into the orchestra.
The gate-money goes to the Ryde Home for
Incurables. “Incurable actors?” queried one
lass who sat through the first performance.
Molly Owen, of Hampton Court (her only
sister is Mrs. Din Garvan), has just allowed
Ted Knox, of Bellevue Hill, to hoist the
usual diamond reserve-signal on her left
hand. Mollie indulges in amateur theatri-
cals, and her Bernhardt-like abilities and
pretty slimness generally earn her a front
rank as French maid and such like. Ted
is an ex-soldier, and his mother is Mrs. Tom
Knox, firm friend of the Rawson Institute
and the S.P.C.A. Nora, her daughter, has
engaged herself to a son of Justice Street.
Mosman and Brisbane were interested last
week when Florence, eldest daughter of
Thomas Carleton, said she would to Arthur
Hudson, of Brisbane, and late of our Flying
Corps. The event took place at St. Mary’s,
Sydney, and the bride and her three maids
(sister and two cousins) were things of
beauty and joys for ever-—the bride in a
sheath of softest satin, with georgette and
silver extras, a Russian head-dress of silver
tissue and a trail of foamy tulle; the
maidens in pale pink, their head-dresses of gold
and pink laid over veils of pink tulle, with
pink bouquets to complete the picture. After
the wedding feast and dance at Sargent’s,
the newlyweds left by the Tahiti for Auck-
land, where the groom manages the Maori-
land branch of an insurance co.
Here you see the studious head of little
Rose McCrae bent over her drawing-block.
Rose’s present
claim to fame
lies princi-
pally in the
fact that she
is the grand-
daughter o f
A u s t r a-
lia’s oldest liv-
i n g poet,
George Gor-
don McCrae
(he is just
preparing t o
have his 90th
birthday re-
ve 1 s), and
daughter o f
Hugh McCrae,
“poet in his
own right and
artist in his
own light,” as
a bright girl
once expressed
it. That Rose may soon become known because
of her own artistic gifts seems quite likely
when one looks at her illustrations of her
father’s satire, “The Art of Julia Chittle-
peck” in the last number of the Home.
Rose (her home name is “Smee,” because of
a baby trick she had of walking demurely
into a room and announcing gently “It’s
me”) has two good-looking artistic older
sisters, Mardi and Huntly.
A beamingly-happy young man is Dr.
Peter Braddon, second son of the Henry
Braddons, all because pretty Peggy Horne
has whispered “Yes” to an absorbingly im-
portant question.
A wedding of interest to Queenslanders
took place at St. Stephen’s a week or so ago,
when Mara Gowthorp, lately of Townsville,
was securely tied by the usual bonds to
Leslie Archie Patterson. Padre John Fer-
guson officiated.
May Mackinnon, of Junee, a daughter of
late pastoralist Angus, has just agreed to
go into matrimonial partnership with Nor-
bert Stephens, who helps assess our taxes.
The Daily Mail is the only Sydney news-
paper with an eligible 'editor—Godfrey
Kelly. But Myra Christie has promised to
cure him of that in May. The bride-elect is
the daughter of Chief Engineer to the Har-
bor Trust P. W. Christie, and knew Godfrey
before he left school. And that isn’t so long
ago—the youngest editor of a daily in Syd-
ney, possibly in Australia, he only recently
slipped into the third decade. His chief’s
example probably fired the Mail’s 6ft. news-
editor, John Farrell, to ask Lilian Campbell,
the brown-eyed daughter of the late R.
Campbell, of Bangalow, to accept a diamond
solitaire. The gold band will be wanted in
this case in July.
One-time Maorilander Amy Murphy made
a reappearance on the concert platform with
the Apollo Club last week. Amy, whose
beautiful skin and hair can stand the high-
light test, looked radiant, and sang with all
the old sweetness and delicacy. Her big
number was Lia’s Lamentation from De-
bussy’s “L’Enfant Prodigue”; but a lullaby
encore, high and soft like a soaring bird’s
note, was the delight of the evening. The
Apollos themselves were in great vocal stride ;
and Ernest Sussmilch and baritone Tolle-
mache were other soloists whose singing-
gained a loud hand from the Conservatorium
audience. Pianist Frank Hutchens, who,
by the way, had a narrow escape from the
seventh wave the other morning at Dee
Why, cascaded Chopin with just the right
degree of dream-laden warmth.
Pauline Miller, a niece of big banker Den-
ison, has joined the Hugh Ward Company;
and another recruit is Miss MacNaughton,
a daughter of Justice MacNaughton, of
Bananaland.
Another Australasian woman artist who is
making good in London is Edith Fry, of
Sydney. Early this year she was exhibit-
ing two oil paintings at tne Royal Institute
Galleries, Piccadilly, with the Society of
Women Artists. One of these —very satis-
factory from a painting point of view' —w r as
a study of the Cornish home of the Austra-
lian Ernest Gibson.
When Mrs. Nelson arrived in New York
she found daughter Gwen down with an
attack of ’flu. While she was convalescing
she and mother passed time ice-skating in
Central Park, and found that for this sport
riding pants and sweaters constitute the
swagger attire for the girls.
All the stellar world must be revolving
round the New York dollar. Mrs. Nelson
in one week met Harrison Fisher, Peter
Ivyne, Burke (of “Limehouse Nights”), Paul
Althouse (he is singing in “Aida”), Raen-
maninoff, Jeritza (the new metropolitan
star), Mischa Elman, Heifetz, Pauline Fred-
erick and Margaret Anglin. Margaret is
still playing “The Bronze Woman,” which is
in its fourth year.
Every smart woman in New York has at
least one tapestry bag and a Salome velvet
dinner-gown. Other frocks are beaded or
stiff with colored embroideries, Egyptian in
design. The new shades are camel and leaf-
brown. Gloves are as freakish as they pos-
sibly can be; some of them are hand-
embroidered and hand-painted. Coffee-colored
hose covers every leg that hopes to be photo-
graphed for the illustrateds, and the stock-
ings are so sheer, despite the city’s blanket
of snow, that they look like nothing on the
legs. Fur coats, except sable and kolinsky,
are “out.”
Ex-champion oarsman Bill Beach cel-
ebrated his golden wedding last week: he
was married on April 17, 1873, at St. Luke’s
Church, Brownsville, to Sarah Dewley. The
happy couple are still living at Brownsville,
near Dapto, hale and hearty, Bill especially
so, despite his years.
Sophie Nicholls, who is a Frances Mary
Buzz travelling scholar, has dropped into
Sydney after cruising around Palestine,
Syria and Egypt. Miss Nicholls was one
of the lecturers attached to the Australian
Y.M.C.A. on Salisbury Plains, and carries
a weight of distinctions about with her. She
took mathematical honors at Cambridge, is
an M.A. of Dublin, an F.R.G.S. and many
other things.
Isabel Fraser goes to Europe next month,
under the wing of K. C. Broomfield’s pretty
wife. They have put their face-powder fac-
tory into expert hands, and intend holiday-
ing for 12 months or so.
They were sitting in the orange grove, at
a recent big dance, both a bit sore, he be-
cause the girl he had looked forward to jazz-
ing with most of the time had selected
someone else for all of the time, she because
she could scarcely command his distracted
attention, and knew why. She could only
hold his interest by talking of the deserter.
She began on her charms and her good looks,
and subtly led to a recital of her flirtations
and conquests, her scheming worldliness and
her angling for fat fish. When she thought
she had him well fed-un she remarked art-
lessly : “But, of course, that is the kind of
woman you men like. Now, you, for
instance” “Me!” he broke in. “Why,
I’d sooner have” He gazed deep into
her inquiring eyes. “Yes?” she whispered,
moving a bit closer. “A plate of porridge!"
said the beast.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our Sir Matthew has been sojourning a few days in
Toowoomba. Before he went thither he heard Renee
Maxwell sing in the Tivoli. Mayor Diddams and
the Tullys were with him and tall Col. Parsons
brought up the rear.
At the Exhibition concert hall the chilly vastness
of greenish wall and hard seat has been largely
populated for the Sistine Choir Soloists’ recitals.
Sir Matt attended the first concert with the Cum-
brae Stewarts.
A gem of a girl of the McLean clan won the
Brisbane beauty competition arranged by Humphrey
Bishop at Cremorne. Although her face has not
yet proved her fortune it has made a start that way,
as she bags a £5O prize.
Lady Ada Morcton, daughter of the Earl who
soon tired of England, has been staying with the
Warakers at East Brisbane, and making compli-
mentary remarks about Australian sunshine.
Alfred Piekford, the tall man with the short
pants, and Boy Scout Commissioner Alexander are
in our midst. A Harmsworth nephew of the late
Lord Northcliffe is also in the air, and was feted in
Toowoomba on his way hither.
Monthly luncheons are being arranged by the
Press Institute. Watt’s cafS will see the first on
the 30th, and Dominie Richards of the ’Varsity will
discourse while the Inky Wayfarers nibble.
Lady Stanley is at Coochin, and later on comes
to Government House to join S’Arthur.
Leonard Francis staged a dinner to let a merry
throng meet Lilian Clancy’s prospective lord and
master, Herbert Mallam, of Lismore, the other day.
A Japanese pagoda covered with yellow chrysanthe-
mums, and streams of yellow ribbon with yellow
candle-shades, completed a suggestion for the Empty
North.
Ex-Judge Jameson has gone back to his old beat,
and is now once more chasing Costs at Townsville.
The Royal Golf Clubites did themselves well in a
bower of roses for the opening dinner of the season
in the club-house. Those who partook of the baked
meats included Mesdames Walsh, G. Brown, P. J.
Symes, Percy Ross, Elliot, Kerwin and Cooper. And
they all brought their husbands.

As lion, representative of the Vie. end of
the British Music Association, Mrs. Dyer'
beckoned members to come to her Toorak
homestead, Kinnoul, on Thursday evening,
to welcome Stella Power back to her own
land. With her golden head shining above
grey satin winged with gauzy draperies, Airs.
Dyer spoke a piece with her prettiest lisp.
Singer Stella, supported by her husband (YV.
O’Rourke) and two Power brothers, trailed
rose and silver brocade under a mist of grey
tulle, hung from her white shoulders by
narrow ropes of brilliants, her dark head
coroneted with a tissue fender sewn with
pearls. Pianist William James, who shared
in the welcome, brought Mrs. Willie veiled
in apricot-colored silk. During a musical
interlude Joseph Foster warbled five Aus-
tralian bush songs by the aforesaid William
(who played the accompaniments) and two
other items. Beatrice Ternan, whose elocu-
tion is as good as her looks, was applauded
for a brace of recitations. For supper in
the dining hall a special board was set for
the star guests. With them were conductor
Zelman and his wife, the Albert Miller
widow, Mrs. Argus Cunningham, artist
Dennis Connelly and his wife, the Fritz Hart
pair and their Basil, Dr. and Mrs. Rudall,
the Bernard Halls, the Harold Browning
pair and Mr. Martin, who is up to his eyes
as hon. organiser in finalising the Women’s
Hospital appeal.
The G. W. Lloyds’ Dorothy dimpled
sweetly under her bridal tulle when she ful-
filled her matrimonial contract with Reg
McCallum at South Yarra Christ Church
the other evening. Pink crinkly chiffon
peeped from inside the square train, backing
a white satin dress, lightly inlaid with gold,
while pink flowers flirted with the white-
ness of her bouquet. The congregation shiv-
ered when Sylvia Vanderkeln and Rosa Tom-
lins followed in mourning robes of black
velvet Avith inky bonnets and armed with
vegeYation of sad autumn colorings. Leslie
and Bertram Lloyd kept the bridegroom on
the right track, while little Nancy McCallum,
with brother Bryan, hoisted the bridal train
from the dust. The after-jollification was
at No. 9 Darling-street, and wound up as
a one-stepping frivol. For this Airs. AlcCal-
lum had lightened her black satin hangings
with entanglements of gold and a side water-
fall of fuchsias.
The Irvine family is again in mourning—
this time for T. D. Wanliss, father-in-law of
the Acting-Governor. At 94 Air. Wanliss
was but a memory to even the elderly. Some
recall his association with the Ballarat Star
as owner and editor, and a few remember
that he was for a term or two in the Dreary
House. He left several sons: one of the
best known of them is the soldier-barrister
who is a pro-consul over in the islands.
Dozens of Landales, Armytages and Fair-
bairns went to the Riverina to see the Hun-
ter Landales’ chick Joyce married to Neville
Armytage, the youngest son of the Norman
Armytage pair. The knot was to be tied
at Deniliquin on Anzac Day, and raised eye-
brows are asking why that particular anni-
versary should have been chosen for the
jovial occasion, especially as all the Norman
Armytage sons fought in the war.
Airs. Dick Peverell lands back by the
Naldera after convoying her sister, Janet
Cumbrae Stewart, to the Cold Land. Artist
Janet has found London an appreciative city
so far as her art is concerned. Her first
show was crowded with the best people, who
spent freely. The Australian-born Countess
of Darnley and ex-Governors Carmichael and
Munro Ferguson (Lord Novar) took her
under their wings; and, most satisfactory of
all the newspaper critics smiled on the
Aussie girl’s art and the Times spent a lot
of ink in praise of her landscapes. Tbe
nudes in which she so specialises were passed
over as merely pretty.
Past and present pupils massed at the
Albert-street Con. the other afternoon, under
their cheery Fritz Hart, to extend the glad
hand to Stella Power. Stella is the Corn’s
biggest success to date. The “Little Melba s
simple brown frock was headed by a ribbon-
decked hat to match. The company sat
round while Gertrude Healey fiddled soul-
fully, and plump and pleasing Dallas Fraser,
just landed from the Fog, obliged on her
’cello. Constance Burt, who makes up in
artistry what she lacks in vocal depth,
warbled a quintette of Herrick sonnets musi-
cally set by' Fritz Hart. Permission had
been granted for the guests to view the Vic-
torian Artists’ show in a neighboring room;
but instead of seizing the uplifting oppor-
tunity a mass Ox thirsty women ned town-
ward to drown their dryness in teacups.
Alberto Zelman and his wile, Harold Bivins
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, the Riddell Stanley w.dow
and Miss imcy itowe were in the crowd, and,
of course, little Mrs. Fritz Hart and the son
and heir.
Fonnie Ellison, a popular South larra
damsel, sighed a matrimonial contract witn
Douglas Shennon, of the S. Aus. capital, at
the local Anglican church the other day. Dn
the arm of her dad she walked spectacularly
in gold and white brocade with rival tail
pieces, one at the back, the other one at the
sde The long-sleeved brocade started ott
medievally, but was interrupted half-way
on its course by a skirt wh.cn surged m d-
■ Victorianly on to the left, where it was
moored by a mammoth rosette clamped by a
gold carbuncle. From this a trickle ot
orange-blossoms dripped over a surplus ot
material wli-ch ended up as the tram.
A glittering stream of gold and white tissue
fell from the shoulders, under a tulle veil,
and Fonnie’s charming head was bandaged
with gold cloth, posies of blossom draping
over the ears. Half-a-dozen gladioli, held to-
gether with ribbon, were in occupation or
the left arm. Gladys Kettlewell, a large and
comely lass, joined dark-eyed Vere de Bavay
in attending to the bride. They echoed
palely the gold and white note, m silken
hangings which increased in volume below
the hip line, and had golden gudles and
patches of gold sh ning down the front
seams. Gold lace hats haloed their faces,
and they, too, carried gladioli. Two little
girls, Betty Shackell and Barbara Lyon,
yyearing similar frocks, stepped brightly
ahead of the procession, and on the return
journey unloaded flowers from gold baskets
under the gold-shod feet of the bride. Charlie
Forrester and a budding medico, lhbrold
Grant, looked after the bridegroom. Healths
were drunk in a marquee on the side lawn
of the Ellisons’ Punt Hill house, where Mrs.
Ellison said “How d’ye do?” in fawn maro-
cain sashed with brown under a black satin
lid tipped with old-gold feathers, and her
elder daughter, Mrs. Harold Shackell, smiled
from under a black velvet hat gladdened with
flowers.
Here is Mildred Gillespie, who came back
to Melbourne recently after several years m
the other hemisphere. She was already
much travelled
ere she went
away foi - a
period which
included five
years of Avar
service under
four Govern-
ments : French,
Belgian, Aus-
tralian and
English. Since
then she has
paid two more
visits to Ind'a,
where she has
a couple _of
married sis-
ters, and she
has lived a
year in Ceylon.
A very live
Avire is the
Miss Gillespie
whom Mel-
bourne remembers as a Mentone girl, with a
fund of anecdote and a turn for journalism.
Among her recent appointments whilst in
England was that of delegate to the National
Council of Women at Cambridge, where Lady
Balfour was chairwoman. One of the first
things that caught her eye after her return
to her long-lost parents was an Argus advt.
for an Assistant Tourist Officer in the rail-
way service, and the department is said to
be favorably considering her application.
A traveller’s snapshot:—
In the middle of my afternoon nap I was awakened
by queer sounds to a piano accompaniment. I
listened for a while, and it seemed to me that I
had heard the air before. Investigation brought to
light a party of children —S’African, English, Russian
and Australian —around the piano. The weird noise
which awoke me was the “Da-djin da-djin awai
awai” chorus of Annie Rentoul's “Baby Bears.”
The teacher of the children was the Rev. Rosalind
Lee, the Unitarian clergywoman recently in Aus-
tralia, who had joined our boat at Cape Town.
Squatter Cedric Campbell and the Guy
Miller widow, now standing on the edge of
a fresh matrimonial plunge, are tying up
the broken threads of a boy-and-girl romance.
The popular little matron (she was Marjorie
Levey) was widowed by the Great War,
in which her medical husband covered him-
self with glory. Cedric Campbell, who grows
his wool in the Ma State, is a son of the
late John Campbell, of Toorak. His matri-
monial bonds with an English girl were
severed by a decree. .
Dr. F. L. Apperly, senior lecturer in
pathology at our ’Varsity, has won the
David Syme Memorial Scholarship for 1923
with a papfer on medical research. Apperly,
who graduated at (Queen’s, was Vic. Rhodes
Scholar in 1910, and was with the R.A.M.C.
from 1915 till the Armistice. -Last year a
special medical investigation earned him the
Lertram Armytage prize. His wife .s a
comely amateur actress and the moving
spirit of the Mermaid Play Society.
The Dick Ivlingenders’ son and heir,
Keith, has just persuaded an attractive
ElsternwiCk girl, Betty Fullerton, to fix a
matrimonial date with him. Keith, whose
mother was an A’Beckett, was an 18-year-
old Melbourne Grammar boy when he en-
listed in the A.I.F.
Men are funny creatures, and they do so
love to pose to us as coldly practical people.
At one of the tramsheds affected by the
recent strike in Melbourne the employees
demanded that an offending notice should
be removed from the board before they would
even cons.der returning to work, and the
Tramway managers declared that they would
not dream of removing it until the men re-
sumed their employment. It was a terrible
impasse. But the pomt is that the cause
of complaint had been ripped off the board
by an employee a few hours after the men
had gone out on strike.
Stella Power, wearing slinky brown dra-
peries lightened with blue and silver, Lstened
to the Albert-street Con. star pupils in the
Assembly Hall the other night. Rita Tay-
lor gave the most ambitious performance
with “Nobii Signor,” tobogann.ng up and
down the vocal Heights with dexterity. Dora
Warby put in some good work with “The
Young JNun.” A prize item was a piano
duet, with a very promising youth, Marshall
Sumner, at the first p.ano. Marie Bremner
called for attention in “The Lament of Isis,”
and Jean Hambledon showed possibilities in
the aria from “Samson and Delilah.”
Shayle Gardner, the Maoriland actor
whose lean, ascetic good looks have helped
him to many romantic parts in the Thames
village, is having a gilded interlude with the
movies. When the last mail left France he
was basking on the sunlit shore beyond
Monte Carlo, and helping the Stoll Go. make
a film of “The Wandering Jew.” He was,
by the way, the first actor in the Rainy
Isles to “broadcast” Shakspeare. No one
from the Land o’ Shadows has broadcasted
back what Will Shaxper thinks about such
spooky things.
Giuseppe Savoia, now lying sick in Sydney,
who claims to have royal blood in his veins,
is identical with Joseph Mucci, a former
waiter at Federal Parliament House. Bar-
ton, Deakin and other members invariably
called him “Joe” and bestowed on him their
special favor and regard. Mucci is well
educated, a capable linguist and musician,
and when the Gonsalez Opera Co. first
came to Melbourne he was a _ popular
chorus-man and interpreter who piloted the
shabby strangers around and introduced
them to their wealthy compatriots. Mucci
had a way with him which many con|-
sidered royal, and when he left Parliament
House in 1908 the presentation of an illu-
minated address and a purse of sovereigns
from members and colleagues was a half-m-
-earnest recognition of his- reputed rank. He
alleges that his mother, the wife of a band-
master, found favor in the eyes of a Great
Personage who was assassinated m 1900.
Remembering his adopted name of Savoia,
it isn’t difficult to guess who the Personage
was. Since he left Italy as a lad he has
had a variegated career selling fruit in Lon-
don, serving on sundry ships, singmg in
opera, running picture-shows and cafes, and
getting married to a sick girl who subse-
quently died.
The Ambulance Service Guild has found
some new supporters. is be «
ss. ball at the Ivanhoe Hall on May 8
(which is a Tuesday) in aid of the tunas.
Mr. and Miss Benjamin are organisers ot
the affair, and their knowledge of where
dancers largelv come from is evinced m
the announcement that cars will leave
I van hoe for St. Kilda when the nights
dance is done. F. A. Alcock and R. M yllie
are joint hon. secs.
Note from a wayfarer: —
Manners makyth the man but man makyth the
manners. The Aussie lady, who was of uncertain
age, arrived with a crowd of others by a long-
distance train at a Paris hotel. As usual they
were lined up at the reception bureau to give their
surnames, their prenoms, their nationalities, their
ages, the dates of their birth and the places
thereof, where they journeyed from and whither
they were going. Things went merrily with the
lady until it came to the questions about age. Then
with one accord the Frenchmen present .sprang
forward. “Oh, approximately only, Madame, ap-
proximated only,” they chorused, with profound
bows. Yet if you had watched those Frenchmen
later (or earlier) you would have seen them strug-
lirg violently with this or any other lady as they
scrambled for a place in the train. Wartime in Eng-
land taught the people the queueing habit : wherever
a crowd waits it “queues up”-—at theatre or railway
ticket-offices, ’bus stops, everywhere. But in France
the victory is still to the person with the sharpest
elbows. The French remain the world’s politest people
, i n speech. In action none are polite excent our-
selves —as a graceful Italian cynically told me
after I had shuddered a little when he exnectorated
voluminously on the floor of the Cathedral at Mil-
ano, upon whose glories he was, by the way, expatiat-
ing at the moment.
The Story Hour season for children has

Saturdays in each month at 3 p.m. A storj

A Melbourne woman treasures this very
latest Monte Luke camera impression ot
Julius Knight, who recently returned to
Australia for
a restful holi-
day that was
to have no-
thing what-
ever to do
with the stage.
Appar e ntly
quite by acci-
dent he wan-
dered into the
glare of the
footlights of
the Sydney
Tivoli with
some other
stage folk, and
they uncon-
sciously started
acting. An d
they’ve been
doing it ever
since, much to
the delight of
the audiences.
The theatre reference boohs are coyly sileni
as to when Julius was born, but they re-
mark that he made his first appearance in
“Called Back” at Llandudno in 1884, which
is horribly close to 40 years ago. Still, Syd-
ney advices are that he is as sprightly as
ever he was.
Archbishop Mannix and his priestly motor
party tooted back to Melbourne at 4 o’clock
the other dark and misty morning, after
attending a church function at Mornington.
The car had struck trouble on the route, and
no amotint of prayer, seemingly, would cure
its ill. At times like this a church dignitary
must feel that such calamities were spared
his Master, the meek and lowly Nazarene,
who never ran a motor-car.
Some gossip from Adelaide :
In connection with the 21st birthday jamborees of
the Methodist Ladies’ College, the old scholars were
hostesses at an at-home to the first head-mist res-,
Mrs. Nichols, the other evening, when chat was to
the accompaniment of music supplied by Mrs. Edward
Reeves, Mrs. Davey, Gladys Henry and Hilda Gill.
In the intervals of their own birthday parties, old
scholars of the college have been working for the
“Save the Children” fair at Unley, which was opened
by Lady Bridges, and at which the M.L.C. Old
Scholars’ Assoc, ran a stall.
The Presbyterian Ladies’ College also had its
day out, when new class-rooms were opened by Lady
Bridges, backed by the full force of the Presby-
terian General Assembly, which is meeting here.
Now another £5OOO has been put down for a new
house for Dr. 11. T. Postle, the principal.
The Hospital Handicrafts section of the Red Cross
Society run every year a sale of work at the Soldiers’
Hostel in the old hospital grounds at Keswick; invi-
tations and tea are baits to lure in newcomers who
may not already know of the shop in Bundle-street,
stocked with innumerable articles made by Diggers.
This year Lady Bridges declared the show open, and
gave it support by wearing one of the latest “lines”
—a hand-woven hatband of delightful coloring. Both
the sale and the subsequent concert did “good busi-
ness.”
A packed house met the S. Aus. Orchestra for its
first concert of the season. Lady Bridges and the
Murrays beamed approval from the front seats, and
Dr. Harold Davies looked legitimately proud of the
success of the scheme which he launched on a rather
sceptical public only three years ago.
A branch of the Royal Colonial Institute is
added to our list, and was duly inaugurated with
food and talk at the Grand Central the other evening.
Jcsiah Symon, who is the branch’s president, had
the Governor on one side of him and Premier Barwell
on the other, backed up by S’Langdon Bonython,
Simpson Newland (who looks no older than he did
12 years ago), W. J. Sowden, George Brookman
and other notables. The Institute admits women to
membership; but there was no femininity at the
dinner.
Our first Dance Club has arrived, and hereafter
its members may make merry from 8 till 11 at
the Osborne Hall on one night a month —refreshments
thrown in. Government House has joined the Club
en masse, and on the opening night about 70 per
cent, of the dancers were the not-quite-so-yoimg
married set —the “over thirties,” who’ve lately found
themselves in danger of being hoisted permanently
to the shelf by intolerant youth.
Adelaide is promised two new “temples.” The
Freemasons have secured almost the only vacant land
on North-terrace, opposite the Exhibition; and the
Oddfellows promise themselves an imposing structure
on possiblv the finest site in Adelaide, opposite Par-
liament House. But this will have to wait till the
lease of the hotel there runs out. And that won’t
be for years.

The Hudson Super-Six has
always set the standard by
which other cars are judged;
in short, it is accepted as the
embodiment of the best and
latest in fine car manufacture.
A position gained by exacting
tests of material, combined
with the adoption of any
proved improvements and a
policy of constant modernisa-
tion on one type of engine and
chassis.
The latest model Super-Six has
many minor improvements
over older models, whilst all
the patent features which made
the old model famous have
been retained. A hot-air
intake has been addpd, which,
with the re-designed intake
manifold, has materially low-
ered petrol consumption,
whilst giving sweeter and
smoother running, with a great
reserve of power.
Tuning chains have been sub-

The Lawn Tennis Council decided last
week that, “owing to Anderson, O’Hara Wood and
Patterson not being available” (Anderson, Hawkes,
Sehlesinger and Melnnes had been selected by Norman
Brookes), no team should be sent to America this
year to compete for the Davis Cup. As a result,
the Council has been pelted with mud by Sydney’s
shrieky afternoon papers, but its attitude has the
support of tennis veterans like Brookes, Horace Rice
and R. V. Thomas, and of the rank and file of ama-
teur sportsmen. It would be a farce to send a
team without Anderson, and one of Anderson’s condi-
tions is intolerable. He insists on the Association provid-
ing the salary of a Iwum tenens in his sporting busi-
ness while he is away—this, of course, in addition to
ine lavish expenses customary on these occasions. The
Council lost caste last year by weakly yielding to the
claim that members of a Davis Cup team are entitled
to be sent to Wimbledon before tackling Tilden and
Johnston in the U.S.A. ; also that their wives’ bills
should be footed as well as their own. By resisting
this further demand it has regained the good opinion
of those whose good opinion is worth while. It
has shown, belatedly, perhaps, that it exists for the
benefit of lawn tennis, and of amateur sport in
general, and not for the convenience and glorifica-
tion of star players.
* * * *
“Jamwood”: Lawn tennis is a capital
game for girls, the middle-aged and the sort of
young man for whom bowls and golf are too slow
and the ruder field sports too strenuous, but the
racket about the Davis Cup wearies me. These
Davis Cup stunts occur too often. Once in three
years is quite enough. In their annual occurrence
they are evolving a type that is of no discernible
use to a world that has the arrears of four years to
make up in the matter of work. Therefore the ex-
cited declarations of journalists who are finding things
slack in the rape-and-murder line that Australia will
he Irretrievably Disgraced if three or four flannelled
johnnies don’t travel to America and get politely
licked by three or four other flannelled johnnies
who talk through their noses leave me cold. Where
were our hectic crime-specialists when contributions
were invited by the Returned Soldiers’ League so
that “Slip” Carr and three other Diggers might be
sent to the Imperial soldiers’ sports in London? Ask
the R.S.L. sec., who has given up requesting the
public to put its hand in its pocket and dig out a
few notes. The paities who are wailing about the
wrongs of Anderson allowed the Digger athletes to
go away with lean purses on a Swedish steamer, the
owners of which gave them a free passage condi-
tionally upon their taking part in the Gothenburg
games. Yet Carr, according to the best judges, is
not unlikely to return a world’s champion, which
Anderson can never be. And “Slip” has a greater
claim on Australia than J. 0., seeing that the runner
saw active service abroad and the raoquet-spinner
didn’t, albeit I am told it wasn't his fault. Also,
what log concealed the sufferers from Davis-Cup
dementia when the hard-up rowing people had to
accept a benefit at Wren and Co.’s Stadium in order
that the proudest State in the Coinmonvrealth might
not have to let the inter-State eight-oar race go by
default, and with it the right to hold contests on
the Parramatta ? A lot of maudlin rubbish gets into
print these days in the name of amateur sport.
* * * *
The party behind Sea Risk had a change
of luck at Wagga (N.S.W.). Ridden by Toohey and
backed down to 3 to 1, Purser’s four-yeair-old brother
handsomely annexed the £5OO Gold Cup, running the
10 furlongs in the fast time of 2min. sjsec, Behind
him were the John o’ Lome horse Alorne, who twice
defeated Easingwold on the latter’s first visit to Mel-
bourne, and Pennyform, Berrior and Uliandra being
among the beaten lot. In a race at Warwick Farm
last August Sea Risk shaped like a first-class handi-
cap horse in the making, but he went off instead
of coming on.. He is now in the pink of condition,
and should be worth following if properly placed.
Messmate”: Jack Peterson, owner of The
Epicure, didn’t long enjoy the £15,000 he won on
that horse in the Doncaster Handicap. He died
suddenly in Sydney on April 20, not three weeks after
the greatest success of his career on the turf. There
was Scandinavian blood in Peterson’s veins, but he
came to Australia from England and became a bush
toiler. In N. S. Wales he was a shearer, and in
Westralia he did a bit of prospecting, after which,
like his pal Paddy Connolly, he settled down as a
publican in Perth. In association with Connolly
Peterson had many good wins on W.A. courses, and
his luck stuck to him when he came to Sydney and
bought into the hotelkeeping industry. He was one
of the few horseowners that have made racing pay.
The Epicure is a good one, and Lilyveil was better,
but the best horse he ever owned was Artesian, by
Argonaut-Effervesee. Racing in Peterson’s colors
Artesian was just behind the placed horses in Duke
Foote’s Metropolitan, won the Coongy Handicap, and
ran third in Almissa’s Williamstown Cup, all this
when miles below his top form. In Westralia he
was a champion, winning the Perth Cup twice and
beating Lilyveil decisively every time they met.
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: The imposition of a £4OO
fine upon a bookmaker reminds me that the present
position in M.L. is farcical. In every centre of popu-
lation there are men carrying on the lucrative indus-
trj' in a big way, while now and again the police
drop on some poor little double-charter who is not
worth the trouble. Prosecutions are never levelled
against old-timers, despite the fact that the average
punter can speak authoritatively as to how much they
have laid on such and such a double. But the Act oper-
ates against these gentry to the extent that they are
not allowed on the racecourse. They work their
commissions from their cushioned limousines outside.

S.A. Football League is about to be incor-
porated as a limited co. The difficult question of
who are to be members is settled by legal opinion
thus: “Two delegates from each club, until they
cease to be delegates.”
* * * *
“M.H.” : The North Sydney League Club
is methodically kicking itself for having lost the use
of the local football ground. Consider the growth
of the “gate” in recent years: 1915: £335; 191(1,
£284; 1917, £272; 1918, £353; 1919, £696;
1920, £1301; 1921, £2600; 1922, £2770. Yet
the League expected to get the ground for £lOO
and 10 p.c. net. What a hungry mob it is!
* * * *
“Lexite”: The lady I took with me to
view one lot of N.S.W. Rugby League trials was
disgusted at the ragged jerseys on show. I explained
that just before the competition games begin new
jerseys are issued to the players. “But why do they
wait for that?” she questioned. “Are they afraid
the fashion may change?”
The citizen herewith portrayed is “Pedlar”
Palmer, secretary of
N.S.W. Rugby Union,
who has had more
than a little to
do with the revival of
the old code since it
resumed business after
the 1914-18 adjourn-
ment. By birth a
Victorian, Palmer went
to Capetown as a
youngster and took to
Rugby, and also shone
on the running track,
winning the half-mile
championship of S.
Africa in 1907. Fol-
lowed a couple of years
at Glasgow Uni., after
which he was engaged
by London Sportsman
to tour Britain with
the 1912 Springboks.
He played with Glas-
gow Uni. as a wing
three-quarter and, join-
ing up in 1914, served
in France, India and
Palestine, playing
Rugby when a chance
presented itself. The
new membership scheme
of the R.U. is one of
“Pedlar’s” ideas and is
proving a tremendous
success.
J.H. (London) : “Centurion’s” par about
Tommy Lawton’s disqualification (B. 25/l/’23) was
wrong in more than one particular. Smallwood was
not “the English full-back.’’ That job was held by
Gilbert, the navy veteran, who got his English cap
at 40. Also, it was just because Lawton’s offence was
a technical one that the Rugby Union removed his
temporary suspension. Indeed, the R.U. acted verv
fairly towards the Queenslander, once the real facts
were made clear. Moreover, the Oxford team were
not pros, by the mere fact of having played with
Lawton. The R.U. rule disqualifies “anyone who
'knou'ingly plays with a professional.” and the
evidence established that none of the Oxford XV
knew of Lawton’s Rugb.v League games in Queens-
land. What Oxford thinks of Lawton is plain from
the announcement, that he has been elected a member
of the O.U.R.F.C. committee. The lad is a
certainty for an English cap next season. There is
no finer five-eighth (“stand-off half” they call it
here) in England, and the retirement of Davies, the
English skipper, leaves the way open for the Queens-
lander.
“Winkle”: Collingwood’s amazing success
in Melbourne football has been largely due to the
way it looks after the local junior. It is the one
club that does not go abroad for champions, yet
in its 31 years under the League it has failed to reach
the finals on two occasions only. Collingwood’s famous
“system”—evolved by the great Dick Condon- —is
the envy of other clubs, and every season it is
necessary to replace stars who have been lured away
by rival teams. This year 11 players who learned
the’ game at Collingwood are leading other teams.
In the League, Danny Minogue bosses Richmond,
Charlie Pannam, junior, is trying to get a little
system into the haphazard South Melbournites, and
Percy Wilson is boss of Melbourne. In the Associa-
tion,* three teams that reached last year’s finals
are skippered by ex-Magpies—-Gus Dobrigh is at
Port Melbourne, Con McCarthy at Footscray, and
Charlie Laxton at Williamstown. Then Bill Walton
looks after Hawthorn, and Maurice Sheehy keeps North-
cote in order. The big money these days is in the
country, and “Snowy” Lumsden has chased it to
ICyneton, “Chicken” Drummond, last year’s captain,
to Benalla, and Bill Toomey to Stawell. These last
two, however, will play for the old club in the finals.
“L. Appo” : In reply to “F.A.” (B.
12/4/’23) let me state that I won the N.S.W. wood-
chopping championship, not only at the late R.A.S.
show, but in 1922 and 1921. Also A. Murrell did
not win a £lOO prize at Wauchope on the day I
am said to have collected “a paltry 15 notes.” No
doubt there are choppers who could clip seconds oft'
my time, and Murrell’s also, but are they looking
for bigger money to do the clipping for, or, as “F.A.”
suggests, waiting for an off chance to win the title
three years in succession, as I did? Murrell competed
at the R.A.S. in 1921 for less than 15 notes and
was outclassed. If “F.A.” is a chopper and wants
to talk chop, I will talk with him in a sporting
spirit, despite my M.L. ancestry.
* * * *
There is good stuff in Jack Johnson, an
18-year-old middleweight from Newcastle (N.S.W.),
who collected the thick end of the purse at the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. Matched against
Herb Thompson, of Sydney, whose forefathers came
from Syria and may have helped Alexander to
ko. Darius great and good, the youth with the ex-
champion’s name exhibited an insatiable appetite
for punishment and an anti-insomnia clout in either
fist. Thompson gave him a horrible hiding for 10
of the 13 rounds. Once the boy was on the floor,
the result of a wicked left. But he scrambled up
and kept going’ until half-way' through the devil’s
round, when he sent Thompson to sleep with a left
hook. The loser displayed capital science and is
worthy of another chance. His backers claim that
he went weak through taking off too much weight.
* * * *
Billy Grime, who wrested the feather-
weight title from Spargo and successfully defended
if against his fellow-Cornstalk Storey, has disposed
of another challenger in Semmens, the Melbourne
bantam. But it took him 20 rounds to do it and
lie had lialf-a-stone the better of the weights. Grime
talks of going to the U.S.A. and meeting Kilbane.
lie would be well-advised to remember that Gooze-
man, who is only a second-rater in America, knocked
Semmens kicking in a couple of rounds.
* * * *
“0.K.”: What short memories these daily
journals have! The other day I read in Melbourne
Age that a lady' billiardist, named “Miss Ruby
Roberts, a daughter of the late John Roberts” had
played a match which she won easily with Mannock,
the man professional. It doesn’t seem long since
Ruby Roberts, whom I once had the honor of beat-
ing in a 100-up game, got her baptism of publicity
as “the Australian lady champion,” educated in
billiards by her uncle, the late Charles Memmott.
A while later she played an attractive show game
with Walter Lindrum, then a lad in knickers. The
bonnie young girl and the lad provided a pleasing
novelty, though the boy, of course, had to play
light to make an interesting match of it. Old John
Roberts, being in Melbourne about that time, saw
good business possibilities in producing Ruby Roberts
in London as his niece, which was a pardonable
invention on the old man’s part, Ruby' being no scut
of blood relation. It was under his auspices, I
fancy', that she went to England, where she has
developed into a capable break-builder as well as
a stylish cueist. Uncle Memmott was an accomplished
player, with an elegant method, and he taught
Ruby to make her strokes, from the outset, with the
true professional touch. He trained her in the way
she should practise, and, unlike the ordinary improv-
ing amateur, she never had a lot of faults to unlearn.
Billiards did wonders for her physically', changing
her from a bouncing lump of a girl into a graceful
pliant, shapely Ruby, with pretty wrists. An orna-
ment to the profession, in fact. As a lady teacher
in private she doubtless has a lucrative clientele.
“The Starter”: No man is more honorably
known in the Sydney swimming world than Freddie
Williams, on whom the A.S.A. thrust a gold watch
the other day. In the course of 30 years Williams
has been sec. of the East Sydney and Manly clubs and
a member of the A.S.A. Council (he is now a vice-
president). He was the first white man in Australia
to shoot the breakers, his instructor having been a
Marshall Islander called Tommy Tanner. Before the
days of the belt, line and reel Fred was the hero of
many fine rescues, for one of which he holds the
silver medal of the Royal Humane Society.
Although Mina Wylie had risen from a
sick bed she retained her 880 yards State swimming
title at Coogee (N.S.W.) Aquarium. Mina was
followed home by 14-year-old Claire Cauldwell, whom
she defeated by 15 yards in 14min. 46 3-ssec. Claire’s
time was 15min. 4-ssec., a remarkably fine effort
for a flapper. But Mina was beaten in the race
for the 00-yards backstroke championship by little
Ella Smith, who was second to her last year.
* * * *
“Fair Go”: Mina Wylie’s defeat of Paula
Iloeft, the Maoriland mermaid, has given rise to a
deal of discussion as to whether women are capable
of accurate timekeeping. In Mina’s first race with
the M.L. girl the time was declared at 69see.; and
she was adjudged to have won the second clash in
68see. Against Ethelda Bleibtrey Mina was clocked
(by men) to have swum 100yds. in 66 9-10 sec., but the
official women timers would not make it better than
70sec. At Coogee, against Violet Walrond and Gwitha
Shand, six ’male watcliholders timed her to swim
100yds. in 68sec., but again the lady timers made it
much more. The sooner men are appointed to hold
the watch in girls’ races the better.
‘Tren” : In thecricket season of 1907-08, that
saw Tarrant’s brief return to Victoria (B. 19/4/’23),
Jones’s English team lost the first Test in Sydney
by two wickets. Then came a wonderful fortnight
in Melbourne. Noble’s 101 against Vic. on a drying
wicket was, a fine effort, but. was dwarfed by Trum-
per’g 119. Victor hit a beautiful six off Tarrant
into the top of the pavilion, five fourers in one over
from Jerry Hazlitt, and reached his 100 when the
total was only 126. In the Test that followed a
century from Hutchings, the Englishman, was hardly
less meritorious, and his straight drive over the sight-
board is still reckoned the loveliest six ever hit on
the Melbourne ground. But what was probably the
feat of the year was an unlooked-for 36 n.o. from
bowler Barnes that gave England a one-wicket vic-
tory. Tarrant’s 206 for Victoria in Sydney—it took
three days to collect, but won the game—-was in
answer to 201 from Syd Gregory. He achieved 1000
runs and 100 wickets for Middlesex in eight consecu-
tive seasons—l9o7 to 1914 —his highest aggregates
being 2030 runs in 1911 and 183 wickets in 1907.
About 6000 people saw Waverley win the
Sydney cricket premiership for the third successive
year, and Macartney treat their bowling with superb
contempt. On a rain-soaked pitch, the little Gordon
champion knocked up 72 in 35 minutes, five of his
strokes being sixers. It was the effort of a master
who has only one rival when in a scoring mood,
which his name is Hobbs. Owing to the state of the
wicket, play began 1A hour late, which was probably
lucky for Waverley. As it was they won on the
first innings by 31 runs. During the season they
played 13 matches, of which 10 were won and 2 lost,
the other being drawn. There are too many clubs
in the competition and some should be mercifully-
passed out next season. W. G. F. Brown, of Sydney,
scored the highest number of runs—76B, averaging
45.17, and the bowling aggregate was bagged by Jimmy
Randell, of Manly—62 wickets, averaging 18.35.
Randell got a place in the N.S.W. team before he
went to the war, in which he was badly wounded.
* * * *
Dr. L. O. S. Poidevin is Waverley’s
skipper, and Mailey
avenges old injuries in
the accompanying pic-
ture. The doctor’s gen-
eralship was a great
asset to the side, but
his average (15.5) was
small compared with
the 63.66 registered by
him in 1921-22, when
he headed Waverley’s
list. He is rising 47.
It is 22 years since
he made 140 n.o.
against S.A. and helped
Noble (153), Syd
Gregory (168), Reg
Duff (119), Frank Ire-
dale (118) and others
to compile 918 against
the long-enduring
Croweaters.
In all £1892 has
been collected fo r
George Giffen, and the
expenses are stated at
£54. The veteran
cricketer is not in
necessitous circum-
stances, but the money
will help to make him
comfortable when re--
tirement from his
G.P.O. billet comes due.
S.A. Cricket Association has appointed Mostyn Evan,
Scrymgour and Hodgetts trustees of the fund.
Giffen has been handed about £l3O cash, and will
receive £l5O a year, paid monthly.
* * * *
“Flicker”: I didn’t want to go to the
cricket match between East Torrens and the rest
of South Oss. because my cobber Andy had had a bad
night, and was not in the best of moods. But Andy
insisted and we went. For our sins we picked a
spot just in front of a particularly raucous barracker
and Andy dislikes barracking at any time. After
a period of cautious play four was signalled. “That's
the stuff,’’ howled the curse at the rear. “’lt ’em
up ;y’ won’t give anyone ’eart failure.” Here he
became aware of Andy’s basilisk gaze. Unacquainted
with basilisks he mistook the hatred concentrated in
Andy’s stare for fervent admiration. “Won’t give
anyone ’eart failure, eh, mate?” he said. “No, it
won’t,” Andy rejoined with deadly malice. “More’s
the blanky pity.” The subsequent proceedings
resembled a session of Mussolini’s parliament.
* * * *
Like the Felton-Barry and McDevitt-
Ripley arguments the sculling match on the Parra-
matta River between Reg Short and Billy McDevitt
was ruined by a foul. The trouble occurred between
Tennyson and Cabarita, when each sculler was finess-
ing for the southern shore to miss the choppy water
and wind, and McDevitt, who was ahead just then,
was ruled out by the judge, Bill Beach. Short
looked to have McDevitt’s measure at the time. A
powerfully-built 12-stoner, he has a beautiful style,
and his backers are talking of sending him against
Ripley for the N.S.W. title, with Paddon to follow.
*.* * •
“J.H.” (London) : One of my routine jobs
has been to chronicle the daily doings of the Oxford
and Cambridge crews for a London evening paper.
On a fine day 10,000 to 15,000 Londoners gather
along the towpath to watch the men at work. So
fine is the sporting spirit that characterises the affair
that it is considered the height of unfairness for
either crew to keep back from its rivals the times
of practice spins and trials. Indeed, the Oxford
coach invariably hails the Cambridge coach after a
trial to find out what the Light Blues have done, and
vice versa. _ But, even with all this frankness, and
all cards laid on the table, times on the tricky
tideway from “P. to M.” are no sure guide to the
result. The crews do their trials at different
times, and this particular bit of Thames water is
never the same for five minutes at a stretch. Ask
Bill Beach, Stanbury, Felton or George Towns.
* * * #
“Nimshi”: Little is heard just now about
Irish athletic affairs, but the distressful country used
to produce the best jumpers in the world. About
the century’s dawn there were two brothers Leahy
who habitually cleared over 6ft. in public con-
tests. P. J. Leahy flew over 6ft. 4in. on one occa-
sion. About the same time W. J. Newburn and
P. O’Connor were rivals at the long jump, but the
latter (who afterwards won the world’s title at the
Olympic Games) asserted his superiority by spring-
ing a distance of 24ft. Ilf in. (nice discrimination!)
on Aug. 5, 1901. Newburn was credited with
25ft. in a private trial. T. F. Kiel.v was another
Celt who shone—at running (including hurdles),
jumping (both high and broad) and weight-throw-
ing. An all-round champion if there ever was one.
* * * *
The Sydney baseballers have an ambitious
season in prospect. There are to be inter-State
matches with Queensland and Victoria, and the
N.S.W. Association is utilising its spare* cash to
boost the game in the schools. M. A. Noble, Tommv
Andrews, Alan Kippax and H. Comber (wrecker of
Gordon in the cricket final) are leading ’bailers in
the Ma State.

“Byro”: At an out-back race meeting in
W.A. I saw a policeman, a parson and a half-caste
playing hazards. And the sin-shifter’s pile was the
biggest when the service closed.
EVOLUTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jn days gone by when tennis stars grew things they
called Dundrearies,
And ev’ry lady smiled above a spreading crinoline,
The form ’ was relatively low. The base-line play
that wearies,
fhe trying lob, the angry smash were very rarely
seen.
And here’s a fact that nowadays seems rather more
than funny,
These sportsmen played for sport and not by any
chance for money.
As time went on another type rose over the horizon:
He wore moustaches, but no hair depended from
his ears ;
His lady friends were wont their forms with bustles
to bedizen;
They paid hard cash to see him play and greeted
him with cheers.
He had not definitely on a pro.’s hard life begun: he
Played partly for the fun of it, and partly for the
money.
10-day the phampion takes the court effectively
clean-shaven;
The figures of his women-folk are straight and slim
as trees;
The faces of the players are like images hard-graven,
The owners being on the make and not concerned
to please.
This type of tennis star his sporting grandfather
would shun: he
Cares dam-all for the game and only thinks about
the money.

The vast resources of Dodge Brothers are
concentrated on a single aim.
That aim is to hold and steadily to enhance
the world’s high regard for the Dodge
Brothers Motor Car.
The' factory of Dodge Brothers, Inc. is
one of the largest in the world, covering
75 acres of land.
The floor space actually devoted to
manufacturing and inspection exceeds
5,000,000 square feet, not including
large additions now under construction.

The number of factory employees is
* over 16,000.
The total number of persons directly
dependent on Dodge Brothers is approxi-
mately 100,000.
Since their first car was delivered, in
* December, 1914, Dodge Brothers have
built and sold more than 875,000 auto-
mobiles.

THE INKY WAY.
A Labor dispute recently delayed the publication
of the London Gazette for the first time in its
history. The sheet was first published at Oxford
on Nov. 7, 1665.
“Hue and Cry”: The Sydney Dilley Telegraph
came out the other morning with a printed complaint
that the authorities of the different lunatic asylums
had set a ban upon its circulation among patients.
Dear, dear —and where can the paper turn for a cir-
culation now !
“C-esar”: “George Rich” (B. 29/3/’23) needn t
let those unfortunate correspondents who get 3s.
yd. a column for writing for bush papers mono-
polise his sympathy. What about the correspondents
who do the job for 3d. a week (the 3d. represented
by a free copy) ? I know' something about it, as
I’m one of those unpaid .scribes myself.
“J.McL.”: “C.McL.” says (B. 5/4/’23) that he
can’t find a real doctor of medicine in literature.
For myself, I am content with the doctor in “The
Bonnie Briar Bush” and the hard-working chap in
“Sixpenny Pieces.” These two are heroes in their
way, and a good deal less absurd than many alleged
“heroes” from the time of Romeo to Mark Sabre.
“Gaznisus” (N.Y.) : Apropos of remarks a while
back about Australian newspapers on file in the New
York library—here’s the list from one who sees
them regularly: The Bulletin (well thumbed, if
not can gilt early), Australasian, Queenslander,
Worker, Queensland Worker, S. M. Herald and
Sunday Times. Other papers ought to get them-
selves on file, for there are always folks in the
library awaiting their turn for the Aussie journals.
“Yardley”: Why are publishers abandoning the
' custom of dating books ? Some of my volumes refer
in their texts to the time of writing, or of printing,
but what that time may be the reader is left to
guess Surely a writer must expect some date
attached to his work if he uses the phrases “of
to-dav” or “of these times.” It looks like two
captains in one ship, each trusting the navigation
to the other.
“Cartot”: Novelists in naming their characters
light on to weird handles sometimes. In a recently-
published English novel the heroine’s name is Indole.
Indole is the name given by chemists to one of then
foulest-smelling substances, and it has associations
in another direction that are even less pleasant.
And the heroine of a lachrymose ballad much m
demand some years ago was called Chlorine, which
is also the name of a particularly repulsive and
deadly gas —the one Fritz used early in the war.
“Jacky Roo” (Lond.): “J.H.’s” prophecy (B
14/12/’22) has come to pass. The bottom has fallen
out of the London newspaper insurance stunt, the
new proprietors of the Times announced that alter
Feb. 28 there would be no more free insurance, and
that all existing claims would have to be settled
by that date. Other papers are expected to follow
the Times’s excellent lead, especially as some nasty
law-suits have been instituted by policy-holders
whose claims have been refused on the flimsiest pre-
texts.
“Faceplate”: In support of “Riverina” (B
5/4/’23) on false tuition given by alleged authorities
on versification, I exhibit S. Gertrude lord, whose
“Lessons in Versecraft” says:
“Words rhyming to the eye but not to the ear, luce
Browning’s ‘youth’ and ‘mouth,’ are alwa >' s P“™ ‘
sible, are indeed necessary m a language so compara
tively poor in assonances as ours.
She may be right, and I hope page 40 will look the
other way when, in my forthcoming ode, Take a
Pull,” I rhyme “cow” with Randvvick. At least
I’ll have the support of punters.

Jean Gerardy having become a serial
triumph at Sydney Town Hall, the manage-
ment announces four extra concerts, start-
ing to-night (Thursday) and continuing on
Saturday. Gerardy’s art is really something
that takes the listener by the heart and the
throat. In nothing was his appeal greater
than in the Lalo Concerto on Saturday even-
ing; the adorable Popper Gavotte again cap-
tured the crowded hall; and an old I rench
dance, “L’Agreable,” was another delight.
Pianist McManus introduced three of
Gerardy’s compositions from a set named
“A La" Campagne”; and the player con-
“French Leave,” at

trived to send the
Sylvan, out-of-
doors, Spring-day
message to the
listeners. Singer
Essie Ackland was
again soothing and
creamy of tone,
and repeated the
favorite “None but
the Lonely Heart”
and the “Picca-
ninny Song.”
On Monday
night, for the last
of the first series,
Gerardy introduced
Elgar’s ’cello con-
certo ; and uphold-
er s of English
music had no cause
to be ashamed
when drawing the
inevitable compari-
sons. Its melody
is not its least
charm ; and, though
one longed now and
then for orchestral
support, McManus
at the piano pro-
vided another of
his most artistic
accompaniments. The other triumph of the
evening was Essie Aclcfand’s “He Shall Feed
His Flock.”
In “What Happened to Mary,” at Syd-
ney Opera House, the girl is kidnapped
by the minions of a nefarious lawyer and
robbed of several millions and a mothah’s
love. Brought up on an island where the
inhabitants make a precarious living by sell-
ing each other fish and ice-cream, the young
woman is (1) mashed by a black-hearted
summer tripper, (2) enticed to a New York
boarding-house—the one opposite the pub,
(3) invited to dine at a jazz cafe, (4) saved
from that harrowing fate, (5) accused of
robbing her long-lost ma (unknown and
unknowing) of 2000 dahllars, when it is
patent to all Newtown and Waterloo that
the foiled Johnnie did it, (6) restored to
the stately imbecile, her parent, and (7)
united in matrimony to the Honest Lawyer
who has plucked her from a ruffian’s em-
braces. Apart from these trifling incidents
nothing happens to Mary. Vera Remee is
that persecuted spinster, Austen Milroy the
Honest Lawyer, Agnes Dobson a business
girl with the art of wearing hundred-dahllar
gowns on a 10-dahllar salary, and Rutland
Beckett the mildest-mannered Lothario that
ever took a typiste to the pictures. The
comic stuff of Bert Bailey (as a humorous
old salt with a wonderfully simulated
wooden leg). Fred McDonald, John ICh-by
and that bright young man Frank Neil
almost atones for the idiocy of the melo-
drama.
“THE SILVER FOX," AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Paul, Plunket and Ashton Jarry as the avia-
tor co-re. and the love-sick poet.
An eager and almost-brilliant first-night
crowd displaced many of Sydney Tivoli’s
regular “vaudeville fans” on Saturday, and
welcomed Julius Knight in a one-act trian-
gular trifle. Threadbare and tepidly sensa-
tional, the play, nevertheless, afforded
superb Julius an opportunity to display many
of his old qualities. Immaculately dressed,
arctically dignified, and immensely confident,
he. of course, scored a glorious k.o. in the
bloodless and restrained contest with Her-
bert Millard, his friend and the would-be
purloiner of his wife (Lizette Parkes).
Julius’s short after-curtain speech left the
old-timers guessing whether it was extem-
pore or another smooth bit of acting. The
Pall Malls are comedy dancers and acrobats,
good enough in their line, one would think,
to make it unnecessary for them to open
their mouths at all. Edgar Benyon appears
in about eight lightning turns, from conjur-
ing to mimicry, each quite passable. David
Poole, ventriloquist, carries on to the aston-
ishment and merriment of the old and un-
sophisticated ; and the Cracknells work mild
wonders with whips, lassos and rifles.

At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, a 16-weeks’
run hasn’t worn away any of “Sally’s”
attractions; and the box-office continues to
sing for joy at having discovered something
to hit the public’s taste so unerringly as
Josie Melville does.

Emelie Polini will be seen for only two
more nights in “French Leave,” at Sydney
Criterion. A fine actress of the older school,
of considerable versatility, the Polini lady
has won a host of admirers. The Shivery
Isles are the company’s next objective.

Harry Lauder still floods Sydney Palace
nightly with mostly national songs and
always racial whimsicalities. For three
nights more the kilted Caledonian will
demonstrate the fatuity of Keats’s proposi-
tion that unheard melodies are sweeter than
heard ones, and the sadness of farewell when
Sydney loses him will be sometning that only
wailing bagpipes can adequately express.
“If Winter Comes,” the play over which
London is reported as not markedly enthu-
si a Stic, pursues the even tenor of its way
at Sydney Royal. Mark Sabre goes through
heartbreaking experiences on his road to
complete felicity with the only woman who
understands him, while the Rev. Sebastian
Fortune remains the last word in unctuous
objectionableness, and the snakish Twyning
runs a lot of Dickens characters hard in
sneaking meanness. Whether the stage ver-
sion of Hutchinson’s best-seller does justice
to the book is more than doubtful, but there
is some uncommonly vigorous acting in it.
“Singed Wings,” Sydney Strand’s big
bait this week, doesn’t introduce much origi-
nality in the disposal of an obstructive wife.
A pining spouse takes the plaice of a Spanish
toe-tripper with whom her husband is giddy-
ing, and is immediately plugged by a rival,
who thinks she is the aforesaid toe-tripper.
“Shadows,” grim and threatening for the
pretty heroine, are reflected on the Lyceum
silversheet. It is mostly the old, old story
of an unintentional bigamous marriage, with
believedly-dead Number One turning up to
make things uncomfortable. “A Woman’s
Woman,” the additional at the big Pitt-
street house, is a post entry in the Mammy
Film Stakes. Bigamy is rampant in movie-
dom at present; it is at the Empress and
Rialto, too, in an item with the conundrum
title of “His Wife’s Husband.” But it is
only lukewarm gruel trying to pass as
Bundaberg rum. “Missing Husbands” are
forgetting their marriage vows to pursue an
elusive vamp at the Crystal Palace; and the
ad. man does the occasion credit. Venus
would have captured Adonis if press-agents
had been employed in those days. With
high disdain for firearm and furious-driving
legislation, Tom Mix moves through five reels
at the Majestic. “Monte Cristo” still re-
mains in popular favor at the Piccadilly.
One grouch, however, local sports have
against the big film- —two-up is not played at
the Casino. Hoyt’s double is good enough
for those that want something with a kick
in it. One flicker is a Wild Westerly, and
the other a torrid South Sear.
Stella Power scored a popular triumph in
the Melbourne Town Hall on Saturday night,
even -though that civic barn was not as
full as it might have been. The “Little
Melba” comes back after her four years’
absence with her art more matured and more
facile, and her easy and skilful rendering
of “Ah, Fors e Lui” gave those who had
erstwhile predicted good things of her a
comfortable chance to say “I told you so.”
She put the Voice through all its varied
paces in a programme ranging from Italian
arias, through some fine French songs, to
less attractive though warmly-popular efforts
of an English composer, and in all she
showed an easy and captivating artistry.
The star was supported by pianist William
James, Miss Dallas Fraser, the English
’cellist, and fiddler Donald Beath, with Wal-
demar Seidel as accompanist, and encores
were as thick as leaves in Fitzro.y Gardens.
The season extends over to-night (Thurs-
dav) and Saturday, with other dates to
follow if available.

Two of the Melbourne theatres talk of
changing their stale loaves for fresh on
Saturday week. Gertrude Elliott, at the
Royal, is to drop her prevailing depression
and weepy mood in “Woman to Woman”
and try the effect of “Smilin’ Through,” a
play whose title proclaims its American
birth. At Her Majesty’s, where Boatrace
Night booking was invited ere a change
of programme was announced, “The Arca-
dians” is to replace “A Southern Maid” on
May 5. Early bookers, by the way, will
benefit by the difference, “Arcadians” being
one of the sweetest things in the trade,
whereas the “Maid” leaves a much better
plot to be desired, despite its 100th per-
formance this week.
if @
The Melbourne theatrical conspiracy to
persuade public-school boys that their
annual boatrace is the greatest thing on
earth accounts for special bookings being
invited everywhere. “The O’Brien Girl” is
already said to have filled the Princess’s for
May 12. “Bulldog Drummond” is accepting
early application for seats at the Palace;
and “The Silver Fox,” at the King’s, seems
bent on defying the probabilities until the
college crews have had their glorious hour.
* * * *
At Melbourne Playhouse the last weeks of
the season are ebbing away in revivals, and
Friday and Saturday this week will, find
“The Lion and the Mouse” renewing their
previous battle of wits.
* * * *
The Orchestral Concert matinee at Mel-
bourne Town Hall on Saturday (28th) will
have Alberto Zelman as conductor. A con-
cert every month is promised up to Septem-
ber, and subscriptions for tne season, with
due cash discount on wholesale orders, are
invited by Gibson Young, who organises the
affair.

“Singed Wings” is the premier attraction
at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week, and Bebe
Daniels, as a cabaret dancer who has a
strange allegorical dream of bliss to come, is
the goddess of the occasion. “Broad Day-
light,” which gets the . audience s secon
preference, is another profound etfort to ve-
veal the capacity for self-sacrifice _ in tne
“French Leave,” at
Sydney Criterion.

Lee White and Co. finished at Adelaide
Royal with a “Bran Pie” revival. It’s
rather a war-time diet, and some of the in-
cidentals (notably a kitchen-wrecking scene)
seem to require the audience to have had
three drinks or so beforehand. The Royal
is now making heavy preparations for the
coming of “Cairo.” The monkey orchestra
is an attraction at the Majestic. They are
wonderfully well trained: still, the audience
seems just as well pleased if the animals
rebel and insist on doing something not in
the programme. In pictures Finkelstein has
taken hold at the Grand, and proposes to
make it worthy of its Rundle-street position;
“Foolish Wives” are just coming in, with
musical frills. These also are supplied at
West’s, where “Doubling for Romeo” gives
a look at the inside of movie-production.
Variety still reigns at the Prince of
Wales, where the cycling Brunettes head a
good bill, and prizes (with the audience as
final judge) are being given to local talent.

Melbourne sees a show of etchings:—
A show of imported etchings at the Decoration
Gallery, Melbourne, is worth inspection by local
students of the craft. One Pietschmann has a
well-drawn study of a nude lady in a pool, and
other delicately-contoured nymphs by Euler and
Otto Goetze dissipate popular superstition regarding
the average fraulein. Euler has two visions atmo-
spherically treated on a rock, and Goetze pictures
in “Youth” an undressed miss watching her reflec-
tion' in a mirror by a canopied bed. “Trees in
Wind,” a design notable for the economy of line,
bears the name of Epstein; Paul Paeschke is an
expert in church architecture, and contributes a
striking view of St. Mark’s, Venice; and mediaeval
houses crowding over a narrow canal in Hamburg
provide Paul Glissler with a fruitful experiment in
light and shade. Among the Englishmen present is
Brangwyn, characteristically asserting the import-
ance of shadows in a proof of St. Nicholas’, Dix-
mude; Pennell puts his signature to a lithograph:
and Alfred East has a treeseape which probably
represents the popular artist at his dullest.
A note on a Sydney show:—
The work submitted for the N.S.W. Society of
Artists’ travelling scholarship competition is dis-
appointing. In most cases there can be no doubt
of the student’s natural ability, but what they have
been taught leaves those opposed to the idea of
travelling scholarships with one consolation —our
students are not likely to learn anything very
much less sound elsewhere. Although De Mestre,
the prizewinner, appears to know what he is after,
there is little evidence of a clear outlook in any
of the work, and the consequent lack of decision
suggests that the students have been provided by
their schools with clouded spectacles. After ah,
the aim of the art teacher should be to train the
student to see correctly and to record accurately
what he sees. This implies that the properly-trained
student should be able to make a record of some
simple object so true that, placed beside the object,
it would give the illusion of being no more and no
less than a perfectly modelled and colored replica
of that object. Until the student’s vision is suffi-
ciently well trained to accomplish this, he is
obviously not fitted to attempt anything so difficult
as the figure or a landscape. On their showing in
this competition it is doubtful whether any of the
students could paint a portrait of a i kitchen cup
against a simple background that would look more
like a cup that might be lifted out .of its frame
than a very obviously “painted” picture, revealing
ideas about color harmony, rhythmic line, composi-
tion, technique and the many other vague “school "
theories that cloud the vision of so many students,
cause them to drop the substance for the shadow,
and leave them stranded.
THE RECORD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is not a mere machine that sings
In this passionate tenor for me to-night
As a needle into a record swings,
Ever circling from left to right,
While the picture grows of those turquoise seas
And the broken yellow of balconies.
I can close my eyes where the lamps are bright
Till the rich magnolia scents rise up,
And I see the luminous specks of light
Dance in the wave of a golden cup
She holds to the curve of her queenly lips,
And sometimes listens, and sometimes sips.
He sings to her, as she turns from him,
The Song of Women from “Rigolette” ;
A moment, over the goblet’s brim,
Her glance defies —but their eyes have met.
There are satin gleams on her dainty throat,
And they tremble now at that perfect note.
“La donna ” God! What a voice is thisl
It could drown a soul with its tenderness!
It is hot with the fire of the ravished kiss,
Of armfe that capture, of hands that press,
Of life that leaps in a flame of red
Yet the man who sings has for years been dead.
How he must have loved in his d&y, alas!
How many rued it? How many cared?
Oh, would that Time with his hourglass
A little more ’of his sands had spared!
For it seems so hard to have shut away
In lasting silence a thing so gay!
It is not a mere machine that sings
In this passionate tenor to me to-night;
A needle into a record swings,
A shadow falls on the brilliant light,
The wind is weighed with the cry of seas
By the steps of those old-world balconies.
Only a needle on a machine —
To probe the secret the black disc keeps
Of the ways where a lover’s feet have been.
When the body under the cool earth sleeps,
Through incense drawn from magnolia bloom
Two ghosts keep tryst in a haunted room.

The Grain and Fertilizer Drill with Spring Tynes,
Cuts out all the soil to the desired depth of sowing. Destroys
all the weeds. Plants the seed on a flat, compacted surface
and covers every grain with a blanket of pulverised soil. This
conserves the rising moisture for the benefit of the seed, hastens
germination, and causes vigorous growth and increased
yields. No progressive farmer can afford to ignore this system.
Catalogues and quotations sent promptly on request.
Made with 17, 25, 29, 33 or 41 Tynes, sowing respectively
8, 12, 14, 16or 20 rows. Rows spaced 7 inches apart. Tynes
are in four ranks, and have 4-inch points. Rigid Tynes
supplied for well-cleared land, in lieu of Spring Tynes., Sows
seed and fertilizer in any desired quantities. Combines two
implements in one, as it may be used as a cultivator only.
Will sow oats on stubble land in one single operation and give

“0.K.”: The late Gloise Juno always
appeared to me in her working days to have
handicapped herself with her name. If it was
a real name she should have changed it. It
sounded tawdry. A good Scotswoman, the
Melbourne Caledonian and Thistle Societies
gave her a complimentary concert at the
Town Hall 22 years ago, when she was play-
ing one of the last characters she ever
attempted, that of Mrs. Callander in “The
Christian.” Previously she had been Helen
McGregor to Walter Bentley’s Rob Roy, and
Nanni in “The Little Minister.” But nothing
else she ever did in the autumn of her long
career was so effective, despite her matronly
figure, as the heroine in "Jeanie Deans,” pro-
duced at Melbourne Royal for what was
billed as “Miss Eloise Juno’s Australian
Farewell.” Jeanie’s appeal to the Duke of
Argyle, played by Edwin Kelly (father of
Edwin Lester), an excellent actor, had much
the same charm of natural pathos in the
voice that has distinguished Maggie Moore
all these years, Miss Juno first studied for
the stage in Edinburgh, but it was under the
management of Bland Holt’s father, in
Dunedin (M.L.), that she first appeared. Her
accent could be English when she chose,
though it was happiest in Scotch. The
Caledonians in these parts never lost sight
of her, and when she was buried Piper Dick-
son played the Scottish Lament at the grave-
side. - - ~~
“Santander”: Australian playgoers have a
distinct grievance against managements that
allow their stars to drop out of matinee per-
formances without giving timely notice of
the fact. In the recent case of one of these
missing dames the news was artfully broken
to the matinee audience, most of whom had
come expressly to see and hear her, that the
lady was ill. It softened the feeling of in-
dignation aroused by the management’s tak-
ing top prices for inferior goods, but could
the audience have seen the patient its sym-
pathies w'ould have been all with itself.
A healthier young woman never surrounded
an oyster. In the course of nearly 20 years
I can recall only two instances where a
management has advertised the temporary
loss of a highly-paid genius through some
disability, and on both occasions (first
nights) the announcement was made per
dodger slipped into the programme. This
proceeding well justified the astute mana-
gerial conclusion that, once inside and com-
fortably seated, few of the audience would
ask for their money back.
GOOD GLASSES.
MR. MURPHY ( very excitedly): “Boi croipes!
Oi nearly had Iter in me hand that
time!”
“Ceesar’s Ghost” : At the opening Gerardy
concert in Sydney it seemed as if half the
audience twice broke in with applause when,
in Baccherini’s “Sonata,” the player was only
giving necessary pauses in the theme —a mis-
take that would be similar to the. interrun-
tion of a Shakspearean reciter who had only
paused at the end of a sentence to make
the next more impressive. The explanation
seems to be this. In every suburban social
circle love of music is a cant; and when
Mrs. Brown says to Mrs. Full-Jones: “Of
course, you’re going to hear Gerardy?” Mrs.
Full-Jones simulates a great enthusiasm as
she replies: “My dear! I wouldn’t miss
it for worlds!” So she makes Full-Jones
get the tickets. They shame one another
into attending these concerts, do these really
unmusical suburban shammers. But it
works out all right, since otherwise the good
music which some really musical people crave
would never pay its way.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : “If Winter Comes” has
been a terrible iiasco at St. J ames’s Theati e.
London playgoers simply won’t have it.
They exact a higher standard than the read-
ing public, as is shown by the stage failure,
not only uf Hutchinson’s best-seller, but also
of “The B#£e o’ Beyond,” by Ethel M. Dell.
That hectic atrocity was frozen out in no
time.
“10-2-4” : How miserably the Yankees com-
pare as creative artists in vaudeville with the
British! I have watched some hundreds of
turns by citizens of the great republic in
London, New York and Sydney, and always
the thing that most impressed me was their
devastating sameness. They do two standard-
ised types well —the “Potter and Perlmutter
Yid and the “Belle of New York” tragedian.
But nine times out of ten a male act from
the U.S.A. consists of two (or three) metallic-
voiced young men in silk hats, evening
clothes, gold-headed walking-sticks and a
profusion of seals and chains, who shout in-
anities in ragtime, intersperse the music
with cross-talk and finish up with a step-
dance. The best of the British stars are
character-actors of a high order. Harry
Lauder, for example. And the people they
present differ wonderfully. G. P. Huntley s
testy, loquacious, futile, courteous English-
man, as shown in Sydney the other day, was
equal on a small scale to anything Charles
Hawtrey has done. Wilkie Bard in his
railway-guard sketch, McNaughton as an
amiable idiot, George Carney, Rickaby and
half-a-dozen others were admirable in their
originality, as well as in their humor. And
they are but the successors of such masters
as Dan Leno, Arthur Roberts and Albert
Chevalier. England has never boasted of the
sense of humor which most Yankees pity it
for being without, yet no U.S. writer has
given the world a tenth of the comic charac-
ters we find in Dickens. And when Yankee
vaudeville-mongers decide to offer their pat-
rons a high-priced star they usually import
one of England’s funny men.
“Norbell”: “The Glorious Adventure” is
advertised as the first picture-play to be
screened in natural colors. But as far back
as November, 1911, the Taits showed a Kme-
macolor film-drama at Melbourne Glac arium,
and the coloring was quite as vivid and
successful as in this Lady Diana Manners
picture. “The Glorious Adventure” has an
interest for Australians that the publicity
fiend has not stressed. The she-villam,
Stephanie Dangerfield, is played by Alice
Crawford, the clever girl from Quarry Hill,
Bendigo, who, after some local success as an
elocutionist, went away with the Wilson
Barrett co. and made a name for herseil
in the Big Fog. Another well-remembered
figure appearing in this movie is Alfred
Woods, who stormed long and loudly in these
parts as the senior partner in the Woods-
Williamson co., and was for some time
lessee of Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Alfred
figures among the also-rans as Peter, a
servant.
“Billo C.”: Came home the other night
after witnessing a modern comedy which be-
gan at 8.10 and ended (with two intervals)
at 10.15 —cost 11s. Bd. for one stall—and,
finding time hanging on my hands, took down
Lewes and Forster’s “Dramatic Criticisms. '
G. H. Lewes, philosophic author and gentle-
man-friend of “George Eliot,” had a brief
career as an actor. This was his bill for an
opening performance: —
Theatre Royal, Manchester. March 10, 1849. Mr.
G. H. Lewes, the popular author, will make his
debut in “The Merchant of Venice.” Shylcck Mr.
G. H. Lewes. After which the farce “Box and Cox.
To conclude with the burlesque “The Yellow Dwarf.
The tariff isn’t mentioned, but it’s safe to
bet you could have seen all that twice for
11s. Bd. and have had something over for
the seven possible drinks in one evenings
intervals. There was no 6 o’clock closing
then.
“Perkino”: The movie censor who inter-
dicted “Oliver Twist” (B. 12/4/’23) would
have had the cordial support of the author.
Himself the cleverest amateur actor of his
time, Dickens was so disgusted with a stage
version of “Oliver Twist,” perpetrated at
the Surrey Theatre, that early in the play
nothing was visible of him but his boots on
the ledge of his box. Yet some of the novels
were successfully dramatised in the U.S.A.
And, of course, Jennie Lee was one of the
great “hits” of her time as Jo in Bleak
House.”
“Pedro”: Of Oscar Wilde’s “Salome” (B.
12/4/’23) J. C. Williamson said to me long
syne that lie was having it fumigated to see
whether he could do it in Australia. There
was a deal of fuss about it in various coun-
tries. But not more than over a scenario
which Wilde sold to Frank Harris, the best
friend he ever had. Harris expanded it into
a comedy, which was a fair success in Lon-
don Then Wilde reproached him bitterly
on the ground that no other person to whom
he (Oscar) had sold the scenario had ever
used it. “You have robbed me,” said the
indignant author —“robbed me of an asset
on which I could always raise 20 or 30
pounds!”
“C. Ockney” : One more Cromwell play has
been added to the list —John Drinkwater’s,
just put on in London. It is unlikely to have
the vogue of the same author’s 1 Abraham
Lincoln.” Henry Ainley has the name-part,
but that fine actor is not provided with much
straw for his brick-making. One flippant
critic remarks that this latest '‘Oliver Crom-
well” is as long and uninteresting as Crom-
well-road, a respectably dull S. Kensington
thoroughfare. Also in the cast is the veteran
Haydn Coffin, once England’s ideal comic-
opera baritone. He it was who saved
“Dorothy” from a premature grave by his
singing of the interpolated ballad “Queen of
My Heart.”
“Orb”: I’ve been going to see plays in
Australia, good, bad and worse, for many
years, but I never yet heard an audience
“hiss and boo.” Neither have I heard one
bark, bray, neigh, mew nor relieve its tor-
tured feelings by any other discordant ulula-
tion. This in reply to Marie Tempest’s
statement, quoted by "J.F.H.” (B. 12/4/’23).
If our groundlings disapprove of a play or
a player they express their judgment in
A STAR TURN.
HENRY: “Yes, we were doing all right until one of my
performing dogs hit the manager .”
HORACE: “Damn clever dog! For how much?"
derisive cheers, hoys, snores or laughter.
They prefer the bird to the boot, and it is
a mocking-bird at that. The nearest ap-
proach to plain boo-hooing that I remember
was at the Royal Standard Theatre, Sydney,
in ’95, when a stage version of the smellful
Dean case was presented. The show de-
served all it got, whether regarded as an
inartistic malpractice or as an impudent
exploitation of a popular sensation. The
audience was just getting out of hand when
the gentleman who personated George Dean
poured about l|lb. of supposititious arsenic
into the family teapot with the remark,
“Now is the time to act!” and a ribald pat-
ron yelled, “Then w’y the ’ell don’t yer?”
Nobody could take the proceedings seriously
enough to boo-hoo after that.
“Mancam”: This Wallace argument
wearies me. It is not to be supposed that
the man sat down and dashed off “Mari-
tana” in one day, or in one year. It is
said that Wallace was imprisoned in Dar-
linghurst Gaol for debt. I never pass that
gloomy, horror-haunted Bastille without
thinking of the composer writing the second
act, at least, within hail of the gallows.
“J.F.II.’s” latest London weather report:
Bowing to the inevitable, Marie Tempest has
withdrawn the frosty “Good Gracious, Annabelle,
and revived “The Marriage of Kitty.’’ Her audiences
are now crowded and contented, and the critics who
downed Annabelle have only posies for Kitty.
“The Great Well,” written by Alfred Sutro for
Matheson Lang, also dried up rather suddenly.
In its place Lang has put on a “melodramatic
comedy” of the Wild West, called “The Bad Man.”
That, too, likewise looks a loser. Nobody is able to
tell. what London will take to this season. Our
taste and our temper are. as uncertain as those of
anybody else on waking up from a wild orgy.
Dot Boucicault and Irene Vanbrugh must really
be going to Australia this time. Speaking at a
swarry, at which old Squire Bancroft described
Irene as the most accomplished British actress of
the day, Dot said he had played in every English-
speaking country, and the Melbourne playgoers are
the very best in the world. “There are no audiences
to compare with them for receptivity and enthusi-
asm.” “Except,” he added reflectively, “at Man-
chester.”
The Australian contralto championship, vacant since
Ada Orossley retired, has been personally handed by
that lady to Clara Serena. After Claw’s concert

“Second Murderer : In
Melbourne 10 years ago I
fluked a “shop” with Horace
Skipper. Horace, an alert,
dapper little chap, explained
that he had a world-beater
of a vaudeville sketch for
five men and one woman,
and he would play the
woman. It was a slapstick,
knockabout kind of night-
mare, with a devil in it, and
Horace rehearsed us morn-
ing, noon and night for a
week. He was a stricter
producer than Oscar Asche.
At the end of the week, what
with bruises and abrasions,
we were as parti-colored as
Joseph’s coat. We had a
try-out at a Palace matinfie,
arid this resulted in the act
being placed with Brennan
and Fuller at the Gaiety
There we toplined the bill
for six nights and two
matinees, whereupon Horace
cheerfully announced, “Trea-
sury at noon to-morrow,
boys.” Noon found us all
lined up and feeling that,
after a week’s gruelling re-
hearsals and nine public per-
formances, we had earned
our unsubstantial salaries.
Horace didn’t appear. On
inquiry at the office we
learned that he had drawn
£.40 or so for the act at 10
that morning and faded cut.
He has never come to light
since, but if I could have
met Skipper that day I d
have played First Murderer
for once.
“Jim G.”: I reckon my old dad, John
Gordon, may rightly claim to be the pioneer
of the moving-picture business in Australia.
Back in 1880 he started out with what he
called “The Great Australian Panorama.
The pictures were old-world scenes, oil-
painted on strips of canvas, sewn together,
and were about 100 yards long by three feet
wide. They were worked by man-power on
vertical rollers, winding and unwinding irom
one to the other. Uncle Tom found the power
while Dad, from the front of the stage, told
the audience what the pictures were about.
Dad also attended to the lighting. As 1
recall the smell I fancy it must have been
carbide. We toured Western Victoria, but
the night of the moving-picture had not
arrived, and Dad went broke, or nearly so.
Next he spread about 50 stereoscopes and
plates round a big circular frame, drum-
shaped, with a lamp in the middle. _
was “The Great American Stereopticon ;

gift. But it crashed likewise. The old un
is well over 70 now; but he is still confi-

“0.K.” meets a vampire;—
Sylvia Shaw, who plays the resourceful, remorse
less “crook”-lady in “Bulldog Dummond,” is anothei
reminder of how easily an intelligent young acti O'
can present feminine wickedness in mimic life. Just
as the r6le of the sneering villain comes natural
to a young man whose father kept .a vicarage, a
vampire part presents not the slightest difficulty
to a young thing of 21 who has been well brought
up. In both cases the limit in sinfulness is expressed
by' smoking cigarettes in a particularly evil manner,
giving the smoke lots of time to curl scornful >
upwards between puffs. Miss Shaw finds the cigar-
ette stunt very trying to the throat on matinee
days. Melodrama, with smokes in it, comes strange
to her after a four-years’ education in classic drama,
she having left school to learn the business with a
touring Shakspearean company. The lady has playtu
the Queen in “Hamlet” and Amelia in “Othel.o,
and her elocution as the vamp villainess in Bull-
dog- Drummond” suggests that she can do either
very well. Her Shakspearean experience was gained
in "the company that Henry Baynton is now running
around Britain—Benson was doing it in the days
when Oscar Asche was young and slim. Sylvia
Shaw talks enthusiastically of Baynton’s talent an.
of the success of her schoolmate and friend, Rosaline
Courtneidge, as the leading lady.

Figure
IF YOU want to look your best, you
must be properly corseted—for no
woman ever looked well, or felt well
or appeared to the best advantage, if she
was wearing the wrong corset.
Is the corset you have on perfectly com-
fortable ? Does it exactly fit your figure ?
Or does it “ride up” on your body and
bulge the flesh at the waist, or push up
under the arms, or dig into your legs or do any of those distracting
things that make you uncomfortable and tire you out and give you
that “corseted look” that adds years to your apparent age?
When you buy a corset you warn one that is comfortable,one that
will make most of the natural grace of your figure, one that will
wash well and wear well, one that will protect your health and eter-
nally guard you against the injustice of looking older than you are.
Buy a Gossard Corset
Twenty years ago Mr. Gossard discovered in Paris a new kind of
corset —a corset that laced in front, designed for herself by a
f'rench Countess, the Countess Fould de Grasse. Because this
new principle in corsetry offered a protection to the health as well
as to the appearance, Mr. Gossard introduced it to the feminine
world, and the practical artistry of Gossard designers has devel-
oped it to its present perfection. Your own family physician will
agree with other undisputed medical authorities that the front lac-
ing Gossard is the o?ily corset that will give you ideal support.
This matter of designing for your type is the whole secret.
Gossard artists, after studying thousands of women, classified them
into nine figure groups and created special models to take care of
the particular figure needs of each group. There are Gossard Cor-
sets created with just the support you need it your age and weight
to give you the proper proportions of the type to which you be-
long. Your Gossards will be differently proportioned and differ-
ently boned from the corsets created for the other figure groups.
Perhaps you have been buying your corset by waist measure alone.
That is a fatal mistake and one of the most common causes of cor-
set discomforts. If you want an exactly-right
corset, one that will always be comfortable,
one that will never need “breaking in,” all
you need do is to select a Gossard designed
for you. It is sure to fit you perfectly and
be absolutely comfortable every minute you
have it on.
Go to the Best Store You Know
Do you realise for how little you can buy
Ideal Figure
Tall Heavy
these comfortable, graceful, sensible, beautiful Gossard Corsets?
You can get one for as little cost as the ordinary corset. But no
matter what you pay, the Gossard corsetiere who fits you will
know types as well as corsets and will guarantee your satisfaction.
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres like Gossard Corsets are designed for the needs
of the nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne models are priceless
to the woman who heretofore has been unable to find brassieres with
special shaping to support and flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up over the lower tops of
the modern corsets. Yet they are most reasonably priced within
the reach of every purse.

Look at those Teeth
they’ve lost years of Good Service
because you’ve been using a tough, gritty,
dentifrice which has damaged the precious
enamel, their natural protector against the
ravages of time and decay. Every time you ve
used" this gritty dentifrice the enamel has been
further weakened. How long do you think
this can go on? Stop it now, and see your
dentist to-day. He will tell you to use
£
DENTAL CREAM
twice a day from now. Your dentist knows
that Kolynos is kind to the teeth and does its
work efficiently and well. It washes away the
clinging film which assists decay, and it leaves the
mouth in a clean and healthy condition. If you
do not know Kolynos, send for a sample to-day.

Fedora: AVe have sent your poem to Hick-
son to have its poor, lame feet cured.... A.T.N.A.:
Sorry, but it would have to be put more delicately.
. ...E.S.J.: Not much body in your brew....
J.A.G.: Off The Bulletin’s track. .. .Efem: One
so villainously old that it casts suspicion on the
other. .. .T.D.: Sounds like a gecko, which is quite
harmless.... Maalaish: Hardly worth space....
C.L.C.: Not quite enough distinction... .Bawra: The
w.p.b. is still blushing... .A.H.P.: Suitable for the
back pages of a washerlady’s album.... K.M.AV.:
To be “perfectly candid,” they are the thinnest
and emptiest we have met for some hours... .E.L.F.:
Pretty in a feeble way.... Obliterator: The verse is
wobbly and doesn’t make its point.... Harry L.:
Doesn’t get near M.1.M.: As dreary as wet saw-
dust... .C.P.P.: Too rugged.... Kat: “The Butcher’s
Luck” has the real flavor: —
I courted Matilda for a long, long year
While the Butcher soaked up beer.
Now He’s stoushed me for Her. When he took Her
in his car
My heart received its severest jar.
He drove Her to a cocky’s place for tea;
Coming home she thawed upon his knee
Ai d the boys of the village could not stop cheering
Billy the Butcher for being so daring.
.. . . J.C.8.: The old things in the old way....A.K.
(Adelaide) : Doesn’t appeal to us. ... W.T.J.: Feeblest
and most foolish of the world’s gags in wicked verse.
. ...W.M.C.: As thin as a dream of pale mud....
J.M.G.: Very bad Will It.: No substance in it.
... .R.F.It.F.: Doesn’t strike us. .. .C.C. (Upper
Sturt) : But Barney didn’t do anything Trifler:
The verse is poor. Don’t write on two sides of the
paper if you want a quiet death... .C.M.W.: Not
much good anyhow. .. .E.T.A.: Very lumpy and ill-
boiled T.E. (Launceston): See if you can’t make
this rest as good as the refrain... .S.S.M.: Very
lugged H.C.: Thirty-two lines of verse to say
there is a good pub! P.E.S.: Not enough in it
to make a story M.D. (Bangalow): Not quite,
but there is promise in them... .Norman N.: You
are off the track this time. Get to something that
rouses you to real emotion and work on your verse.
... .Learner (W.A.) : Impossible... .P.M.R.: The
constant repetition of “thou,” “thy,” “thine” and
“hath” only emphasises the fact that you are stating
commonplace.... Flicker: Read some decent Verse
and get an idea of what you‘are trying to do
Jeion: The thinking is more muddled than the verse.
What is a “fallen prostitute,” f’rinstance? One who
has fallen from prostitution?... .P.R.A.: It sails
with a liet and won’t steer straight Creeping:
Study the construction of the English language by-
way of a start. .. .A.D. (Balmain): An also-ran....
Midas : The verse Isays nothing except that spring
follows winter. The yarn only tells of the old
drought and the old flood in the old way....01d
Colonist: But the verse must be better than that....
0.W.8. J.: Needed to be made more credible....
G.0.A.: It may be all true, but it makes dull read-
ing.. ..Dick R.: Made us very sad.... Molly M.:
Pale as a string of bread-and-pork sausages....
C.L.C.: Too slight Dolph M.: The coach bowls
bravely along:—
Now the dust in clouds
Settles on harness in shrouds.
The tires run hot.
The driver curses his lot.
The wondrous sun red of hue
Like golden corn kissed by dew
Sinks to sleep down in the west.
Whilst birds away to nest.
Evening is falling fast.
The pace is slacker at last.
Of pursuit there is none.
The ride’s well truly won.
A.E.G.: Far too slight M.M. (Ponsonby.) :
Not enough marrow in the bones... .Z.V.W.: It
creaks Spadger: Utterly futile.. . .Wisconsin:
Sad stuff that amounts to nothing G.0.H.: What
does all the turmoil of those heavy words amount
t 0?... .D.P.M.: Your people don’t talk to any pur-
pose. .. .P.J.1.: All of it has been better done
before P.8.P.: Spoiled by the commonplaces and
the tag at the end... .E.G.M.: Try to get at least
the ring of sincerity into it.... Berry: The metre
is insane and the thought commonplace. .. .Dave C.:
You’ve got that “unkempt poet” from the wrong
viewpoint. Laugh at her if you like, but to lecture
her is absurd. The “Milliner” falls to pieces in
the same way. Try again... .E. 1.8.: Shouts the
usual thing that has been said without -truth in
every age and generally in corduroy verse... .J.J.H.:
Write about the little things you know.. . .W.C.M. :
Not up to the chalk line K.D.: Try again—in
a few years. . . .R.G.T.: It’s suffering from the
drought P.S.L.: Yarn won’t d 0.... Digger S.:
No use, Dig J.H.S.: Bumps and wallows to lio
purpose W.W.A.: It’s very poor mirth F.S.
(Te Uku) : A sonnet must be much better done than
that.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.D.: Weak imitation of C. D. Gibson with puerile
gag attached.. . .F.H.S.: A long way off print
standard J.8.P.: Hopeless.. . .M.D.: It is a horse,
isn’t it? J.H.W: Not up J.J.W.: Hardly worth
it W.W.: In the baby class E.K.: Your idea
of a woman’s foot is commendably original
T.L.V.H.: Only Bruce is allowed to wear spats in
The Bulletin ..... E.S, II.: Falls down in the draw-
ing G.R. A.: Try something distinctively Aus-
tralian.... F. A.: You’ve picked the wrong hobby;
try growing tomatoes.
“Sucre” ■: “Ole Harry done liisself t a bit
of good larst week,” said Smacker. “Gotta
job cleaning windows on a six-storey house.
’E fell outer one, broke ’is legs, swallowed
most o’ ’is teeth, gashed ’arf ’is boko horff
and busted ’is right eye. Now ’e’s m ther
Sydney ’ospital—won’t do no work for
three munce, p’raps never- —an’ he gets a
’undred quid. Blime, some blokes can’t go
wrong.”
“D.F.”: The absurdity of insisting on
unanimity in a jury was put forward in
N. S. Wales not very long after the intro-
duction of the jury system. In 1830 Gov-
ernor Darling sought the opinion of certain
leading citizens on the jury question, and
one of them, Alexander Berry, wrote: —
I think it would be desirable if the verdict wa*
given by a majority, but that not less than three-
fourths should concur to convict the prisoner. It
is incongruous with the general principles of human
nature to expect an absolute unanimity of opinion
in 12 men, and though forming a prominent part
of the law of England, seems so contrary to the
principles of every other part of her institutions
that most likely it is a deviation.

Before Edison invented it there was no
electric light—just a substitute, like gas
and oil lamps.
Before Edison gave us music Re-Created
on the New Edison, there were only the
thin, strident, substitute tones of the
talking machine.
Before Edison made his Storage Battery,
electrical power could only be stored in
the make-shift lead-acid accumulator.
Sooner or later you will be specifying Storage Bat-
teries for some need or other; it may be an Electric Car
or Lorry, a House-Lighting Plant, or Ignition and
Lighting for Launch or Automobile. That’s the time
you will want to keep the name Edison in mind—
and free yourself from any possibility of a host of
battery troubles.
Exclusive Edison Advantages:—Light in weight;
vibration has no effect; unbreakable Steel Con-
tainers; little loss of charge when idle; no
frequent hydrometer reading; no expert attention is
required; assembly and connections simple; can be put
on charge at any time; buckling and sulphating impos-
sible; 115° Fah. will not harm electrolyte; has several
times the life of any other; no noxious fumes to cause
injury or corrosion; may be left idle either charged or
discharged without harm; excessive charging or dis-
charging have no permanent detrimental effect.
EDISON Storage Battery
We send post free, on request, an interesting bulletin dealing with the many new adaptations of electrical
power made possible by the Edison—amongst them traction, car lighting, mine and marine service.

“Machete”: “Bret Vane” (B. 5/4/’23)
asks how the ancient Egyptians preserved
the grain found in the tombs so that it “ger-
minated after being kept thousands of years.”
The only adequate answer is that they didn't.
The story of the mummified wheat is one
of the ineradicable fictions of pseudo-science,
and has been run down and apparently slain
time and again by duly qualified authority.
Like the Australian kangaroo that is born
on his mother’s teat, this grain is deathless,
and, in that sense, certainly is immortal.
“T. 0.1.”: The Euston Hotel, George-
street, Sydney, passed out under the hammer
the other day at £lB,OOO. The building is
on the corner of Uean’s-place, one-time known
as Robin Hood-lane. Back in the early
’thirties, and probably before, there was a
Robin Hood Inn there. In the first ’forties
it was known as the Scotch Thistle, kept by
James Aylward, and under various signs it
has held a license ever since. Fred Gunther,
well known as a caterer a generation ago,
ran it as the Brisbane Cafe Hotel.
* # *
“D.F.”: Even without ambergris, of which
a single lump might run to a thousand or
so, a good whale was worth a pot of money
in the palmy days of whaling. In his notes
on the old Tasmanian industry, Dr. Crow-
ther, of Hobart, whose father was a leading
owner of whaling vessels, states that a sperm
whale caught by the Marengo yielded 15
tuns (each 252 gallons) of oil, worth at
the time £l5OO. Another, taken by the
Elizabeth Jane off Southwest Cape (Tas.),
boiled down for 13i tuns.
* * * *
“Devilfish”: Invercargill did not start as
a dry district. In fact, Maoriland’s first
homegrown whisky was made in those parts.
In 1839, when the New River, on which
Invercargill now stands, was a big bay
whaling station, Owen McShane, said to have
been an escaped lag from Van Diemen’s
Land, and his partner George Printz, had
a still at Oue and did a roaring trade, not
only with the local whalers but with others
as far away as Preservation Inlet.
* * * *
“Herodot”: A modern variety of cheque
swindle was recently tried here. A suburban
tradesman having cashed a cheque for a
man who had had a few dealings with him
on a cash basis, there was a delay of a few
days before paying it into the bank, and then
it was noticed that not only had the ink
become dimmer, but in places it had
disappeared altogether. It was a clumsy
effort on the part of the crook, but it sug-
gests possibilities in more skilful hands, and
people who are in the habit of giving cash
for cheques might as well prepare for them.
“B.”: It is now unnecessary to import
telephone and telegraph insulator pins.
Tuart, a Westralian timber, was proved ideal
for this class of work in a recent test at
Adelaide. It is necessary for a pin to stand
a strain of 2001 b. sideways when in position,
and although a 4001 b. pressure was put on
in the test, there was no sign of breaking.
The testing-machine blew out under the
strain, so the exact breaking-point was not
discovered. The Commonwealth uses approxi-
mately 1,500,000 pins annually, so there may
be a nice little side-line for Westralia, and
all the nicer because small-size tuart can be
utilised.

“Aparima”: Among his efforts in favor of
Australian industry Governor Macquarie
tried to promote the use of articles made
of New Zealand flax ( Phormium tenax) , of
which considerable quantities were worked
up in Sydney from 1813 onwards. But
there was one official who did not appreciate
the Maoriland material. This was the hang-
man and public flagellator, who entered a
formal protest against it. He said it was
too soft, and that with a “cat” made of
flax it took 25 lashes to raise a wheal and
30 to draw blood. He therefore petitioned
to be allowed to return to the “tried and
proved” Manila goods.
* * * *
“Vanikoro”: Australia’s first sandal-
wooders sought the smellsome stuff in the
Pacific Islands, (nostly Fiji and Tonga. In
1804 Simeon Lord, the Sydney merchant,
chartered the Union, belonging to the Fan-
nings of New York, to take a cargo from
Tonga to China. The captain of the Union,
six of his men and a Sydney man named
Boston who went as supercargo were killed
by the natives, stirred up by a renegade
Lascar who had “gone native” when the
crew of the American vessel Duke of Port-
land was cut off a couple of years earlier.
Incidentally, the Crew of the Union rescued
a white woman, Elizabeth Morey, who had
been made prisoner at the same time.
Wright, the mate of the Union, made an-
other effort to deliver the goods, but lost his
vessel, his crew and himself on a reef. How-
ever, in 1805 James Aitken brought up a
cargo from Fiji in the Marcia, a schooner
belonging to Lord, and in a few years the
trade boomed in spite- of an import duty
of £2 10s. a ton clapped on at Sydney.
THE BOOKIE AND HIS FARM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“According to a story told the police by a book-
maker named Emanuel Josephs, of St. Kilda, he was
set upon at midnight by armed men near his farm
on the Dandenong Ranges.”
The bookie is a farmer
Who on his fair farm plods ;
He sows elusive prices,
And cultivates the odds.
To gather in the harvest
That honest toil may yield,
He roots about the paddock
And ten-to-ones the field.
Ah, heavy weights of horses
Within his bag he lumps ;
He harvests crops of hayseeds
And simple city chumps.
Upon hi*s farm behold him —
A farm most good to view
That shows to all beholders
What honest toil may do!

TWO YEARS AGO Palmolive Soap was introduced to the Australian public. Immedi-
ately it achieved a place and a reputation which paralleled its position in the Unitec
States, in Canada, Great Britain and on the Continent of Europe. Its success was
more direct, more instant, more wide-spread than had ever been gained by a similar
product in Australia. ' Palmolive became a household word—the soap a household
need. And this, despite the fact that it was necessary at that time to market Palmolive at
fifteen-pence the cake.
Two years ago all costs attending the importation of Palmolive Soap were higher. Exchange
was unfavorable, freights excessive and handling charges of all kinds exorbitant. This
financial oppression was the aftermath of the Great War, and dictated the then price of Palmolive.
Later, these costs abated somewhat and, immediately, the price of the soap was lowered to
one shilling. The already phenomenal sales increased. Palmolive became firmly and definitely
established as an Australian national requirement.
Its extending use among Australian men and women made one thing clearly apparent.
Palmolive must be manufactured in Australia in a completely equipped factory. Plans were
laid, a site chosen, the work begun and the Palmolive Factory is now being rushed to speedy
completion. The present year will see Palmolive produced in Australia by Australian labor
under the best and healthiest conditions.
Naturally, this local production will, besides distributing much money in Australia in salaries
and wages, reduce all incidental costs. It will make possible the reduction of price to the
lowest point at which a soap of such quality can be sold. In ordinary circumstances, such a
reduction would apply only when the Palmolive factory is in complete operation. But a
daring stroke of policy has been decided upon, in the belief that increased consumption by
thousands of new users will justify such an action.
To-day, and henceforth, Palmolive Soap will cost only 7Jfid. per cake.
The aim Is to stimulate an ever wider demand and more general use of Palmolive by offering
NOW, the most wonderful value ever seen in Australia. It is vitally to your advantage to
remember that every cake of Palmolive you use helps to insure the retention of the soap at
so remarkable a figure.
All can now afford Palmolive
the toilet luxury at household cost
Price, 7|d. per cake everywhere

The Palmolive factory now in course of erection at Broadstairs Street, Balmain, Sydney, adds to the list of Australian enterprises, a building
representative of the highest Australian architectural skill. The Palmolive factory will be equipped with mechanical appliances of the la est
type, and everything possible, including machinery and equipment, is being manufactured or purchased in Australia. The operation of
this new organisation will make possible the employment of a large staff of Australian workers and also the continuous absorption in
enormous quantities of Australian raw materials. Nothing could better that!

Thomas Francis Crick, who died recently
at 54, was a resident of the Wellington
(N.S.W.) district all his life. He was a
brother of “Paddy,” whose political career
came to grief in the Lands Department, like
that of a good many others.
“8.V.D.” : Another example of the terrible
effects of living in the tropical parts of Aus-
tralia is supplied by Mrs. MacDonald, of
Goondiwindi (Q.). She is a Scotch body who
came to live in that disastrous climate 90
years ago, and is still doing it. Her birth
certificate shows her to be 106.
Passed out recently at Ontario, Canada,
Sergeant Richardson, late of the old 34th
(Cumberland) Regiment, the oldest holder
of the V.C. He won the decoration at
Kewanie, Trans-Gogra, India, during the
Mutiny. Sir Dighton Probyn, 90 last birth-
day, can now claim to be the oldest V.C.
“Bauhinia”: A recent Bulletin men-
tioned some “young bloods” mining on Fossil-
brook (Q-). Our small village-—George-
town, Etheridge Goldfield (N.Q.) —can count
14 similar awful examples of the effects of
our climate and hard work (also a good deal
of hard drink). Their ages range from 66
to 82' years, and total 1056 years, or an
average of 75A —and only two or three are
on the pension-list.
At their convention at Hamilton, Vic-
torian farmers talked again of commemorat-
ing the work of Farrer, the wheat breeder,
but there is no certainty that anything wili
be done. Last year it looked as if something
would follow an outburst of enthusiasm, but
a frost set in. Unfortunately for those who
would have a Farrer Institute, the football
•season follows too soon after the agricultural
corroboree.
“V.C.’’: Surg.-Gen. Charles Ryan may
have been rather blunt in his dealings with
aspirants for C 3 tickets on the other side,
but his judgment was keen. The other day
a partly-oiled ex-Digger halted him in Col-
lins-street, but Ryan disowned-acquaintance-
ship. “You called me a dam’ liar when
you boarded me,” grumbled the Digger.
“Well, wasn’t I right?” retorted the dapper
little medico, as he got under way- once
more.
The Major Crane, S.M., about whom a
rumpus has been made on the Maitland coal-
field, used to be C.P.S. at Paddington. One
woman complained to him there of the
treatment of a man who had “strung her
on” with talk of marriage and deserted her
the day after the wedding. “The marriage
was actually celebrated, then ?” asked Crane.
“Yes, sir,” replied the woman tearfully. “We
’ad a bottle of whisky and a dozen of beer
amongst five of us—and I ’ad to pay for it!”
“Banovallum” : At which spot on the east
coast of Australia did Bligh and his party
of the Bounty first land? I have read three
stories of the mutiny and they all differ in
this respect. One stated that it was some-
where about where Rockhampton now is;
another that Bligh was “41 days in an open
boat and covered 4000 miles before reaching
a small settlement on the Australian coast” ;
and the third that he landed at Restoration
Island, above Cooktown. Which, if any, is
correct?
An old turf identity went west lately—
Thomas Moore, who had been for a quarter-
of-a-century sexton of St. Mary’s, West Mait-
land (N.S.W.). where lie was born 77 years
ago. A brother of John Moore, veteran
horse-trainer of Randwick, Tom claimed to
be the oldest jockey in Australia. His father
was a vet. in early days, and trained horses
for Dr. Bowlter, then of Newcastle. The
sexton-to-be rode some of the doctor’s fliers
as a boy, Maid of the Lake, Black Swan and
Sir Solomon among them.
“Plasmon”: City Aid. Burton isn’t the
unchallenged “oldest carriage-builder of
Melbourne” (B. 12/4/’23). Dan White, his
rival, landed in Melbourne in 1861, and after
working for J. W. Hackett, of Fitzroy, for
seven years, opened in business on his own
account in Swanston-street. In a little under
20 years he made £20,000, but dropped the
bulk of it in the boom. Motor-body build-
ing has put a lot of money in the bank since,
and the old Tipperary boy, still well and
hardy at 90, isn’t complaining.
“L. See See”: Recent mention of Billy
Hughes going in by the back door at Federal
Government House to tender his resignation
to the G.-G. recalls an incident during the
Carrington regime in Sydney. A legislator,
having the right of private entry, presented
himself at the side door of Government House
one morning, where he was met, as he
thought, by one of the maids. He was very
affable to her, and gave her half-a-crown.
Then she showed him into the vice-regal
presence with “Here’s a gentleman to see
you. Bob; and here’s half-a-crown he gave
me.”
“Jar”: Eminent K.C.’s don’t always get
the money before they don wig and gown.
Not so many years ago, in the Cold Country,
I was detailed to register an important brief
and a cheque for a thousand-odd guineas
for the eminent Aspinall. I registered the
brief all right—it w r as too bulky to forget—
but left the letter and immense cheque in an
inner pocket for over two weeks. Aspinall
duly appeared and won his case, but never
murmured to my firm of his missing fee and
refresher. It was a song in a pantomime
about money that unlocked my wayward
memory, and sent me headlong to the G.P.O.
to despatch the belated fee. The receipt
came along without any comment, and I did
not get the sack I deserved.
“Block 10”: Who is responsible for the
N.S.W. Education Dept.’s geography? The
“Geography for Primary Schools,” issued for
use of senior pupils, states that Vancouver
is “the flourishing capital of British Col-
umbia” ; while the March number of the
School Magazine for sixth class informs us
that Vancouver rests on “Burred Inlet at
the mouth of the far-famed Frazer River.”
When I was there the capital of British
Columbia was Victoria, 85 miles from Van-
couver, and I still have pleasant recollec-
tions of a motor spin from Vancouver, on
Burrard Inlet, down to the Frazer River,
some miles south. But that was before the
war, and, of course, it’s hard to keep track
of all the changes of the past few years.

I want to add my testimony to the many which you have regarding
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, for I have tried this remarkable remedy, and
I can honestly say that I have never come across anything to equal it. It
is simply amazing how quickly it eases my throat and cures my cold.
There is nothing in the world puts me out more than a cold, and I was
feeling quite distressed when I started to use Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
on the advice of a friend, and I had not taken two doses before I began to
feel better, and one small bottle put me quite right again. It is a true
Remedy, and I heartily recommend it.

Afrel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f'MHROUGH Afrel runs a river of grass
I With purple ripples and shallows of
green;
And if that way your eyes should pass,
Look well the red-fruit boughs between
For Afrel gables gleaming white,
And Afrel lattices of blue,
And little gleams of amber light
The magic chestnut trees let through.
For there is never a road to lead
And never a gate on a crying hinge.
Who walks in Afrel wears at need
A white robe with a lilac fr,nge.
Two solemn prayer-lengths up the hill
There is a bell of yellow brass,
And over the bell a tower of glass
Blue and hard as a man’s will.
The rippling river of purple grass
At the sound of the ringing is hushed and
still.
He who wears the amethyst
And the white robe dreams have kist
Walks in Afrel if he dare
The wonder of the amber air
That is a poison and a grace
Laid warmly on the holy place.
It shall poison him who stands
With lifted heart and reaching hands.
As the light about him streams
He shall die of his own dreams,
Inwardly consumed of fire
That is seed of his desire,
Burning thought and thought apart
In the crowding of his heart.
He that holds the amethyst
Shall go softly in that air,
Cooled as by the happy mist
Of a child’s thrice-spoken prayer;
And all Afrel shall be sweet
To his forehead and his feet.
Afrel city lies four-square,
Kneeling upward from the west;
Fire of sunset lingers there
Like an opal on her breast.
But the morning loiters long
Gabled roof and tower between,
With the shadows fainting green
And the echoes dreaming song.
In Afrel’s thronging market-place
Are merchantmen of quiet face;
And he who brings his goods to sell
Shall at her counters bargain well.
A pilgrim bag of jacinth stone
Shall buy an alabaster dish
Of peaches grown in Paradise
That fell, by winds of rapture blown,
Upon a field of desert spice.
The wares are here for every wish,
And all who enter pay the price;
For wealth is measured by the will,
And he who comes with nought to pay
Finds nought that he would bear away,
Yet loves the place and lingers still.
There are no streets in Afrel town.
The sapphire-sellers keep the sun
Where roses toss their petals down;
And fruiting vines in greenness run,
Leaf and tendril and budding withe,
Over the stall of the silver-smith.
Fountains leap from an agate stair,
Dance and sparkle betwen the trees
Where one in coolness spreads his ware—
Honey and almonds and mountain cheese.
And there are cellars in Afrel town—
Down and down and darkly down
To where for lamps the rubies shine
To catch the glamor of the wine.
Tall casks are on the earthen floor;
And he who drinks once shall thirst no more,
But feel the fire of truth a-tlrip
For ever on liis heart’s red lip.
Through Afrel airs a lady goes
Whose voice is the sweet of a deep red r'ose
That bloomed in an autumn of yellow light
Near to the brink of an ancient sea.
She has but spoken a swallow flight
Of words rich as a bridal night
With tender melody.
The worlds and the stars have bent to hear,
Fainter and fainter on heart and ear,
The echoes of that far singing;
But in Afrel the little jades are ringing
Thin green bells as her light robe sways.
Softly she goes;
You shall fiear her speaking,
With no far seeking,
Like the bride voice of a new white rose.
* * * *
There is no death in Afrel town.
Only, weary with life and spring,
The tired folk lie gently down
And through the greener shadows sing.

Quong Hing’s Monkey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
QUONG HING was an opium-ash eater
from Tientsin, and people wondered
how he earned his living. For the
man who chews opium-ash, the vilest form of
the opium habit, usually earns no living to
speak of, and soon ceases altogether to live.
Yet the source of Quong’s income was no
mystery to at least two people in Tientsin.
Quong Hing himself and the other monkey
he always carried about the bazaars on his
shoulder knew quite well that Quong derived
the sustenance of life, and a bit over, from
the. cargoes of Chinamen which the pair of
them ran in their lateen-sailed junk out of
Soviet Russia. “The pair of them” is said
advisedly, for the monkey, a short-haired,
wizen-faced little devil of some 2000 years or
1 hereabouts, possessed, in addition to the
things taught him by Quong, the wisdom
banded down from tfie original ancestor of
monkeys which Quong. being a little further
removed, quite lacked. What he didn’t
know about Customs and revenue officers
was not worth bothering to learn. It
was Quong’s boast, when swaggering in P’e
bazaars after running a particularly profit-
able cargo, that the monkey could tell a
revenue officer by_ smell; and a patrol boat,
iff whatever disguise, was as a flare signal to
him.
Originally of tfie boat people on the Grand
Canal, Quong Hing had graduated by divers
means into owning his own junk, in which,
under agreement with the Soviet Government
of Russia, he conveyed back to China for
burial the bodies of any of his compatriots
who died in the service of the enlightened
Soviets, charging the relatives a fee for each
rescued body.
It was not on the dead men, however, that
Quong made his money. They were merely
the blind used to cover the serious and profit-
able part of his trade. For a dead relative,
particularly if that relative be a father, a
Chinaman will pay handsomely. To get out
of the living hell which was Russia, into
which they had been seduced by promises of
much food and abundance of loot, live China-
men were prepared to pay their last cash,
and every other cash they were likely to
earn for years to come. It was in the run-
ning of these men that Quong Hing made his
money, and, incidentally, encountered a plen-
titude of the adventures and excitements of
life.
The Soviet authorities had most pro-
nounced and strong objections to the spiriting
away of their pet executioners. The Chinese
executioner was a conscientious and thorough
worker, and was hard to replace. To pre-
vent his clandestine departure revenue offi-
cers were stationed at various points along
the coast, and it was the circumvention of
these officials that added the spice of life
to Quong’s existence.
In an elaborately-fitted junk Quong plied
his trade, and it was his boast that the
revenue officer hadn’t yet been born
who could catch him with a live cargo.
There was reason for Quong’s braggadocio.
There were, in fact, two reasons. A false
sliding deck to his junk provided the first;
Quong’s absolute and aloof disregard for
human life other than his own, the second.
Secreted in the never very airy hold of
Quong’s junk, the absconding Chinamen were
safe, and certain to see their relatives again
so long as Quong did not run foul of a
patrol boat. But let a revenue cutter heave
into sight, and a secret spring, handy to
Quong’s hand at the helm, quickly closed the
deck and effectively guaranteed that nothing
except dead Chinamen would be found aboard
his craft. To make doubly sure of his own
immunity from capture on such occasions.
Quong had taught his monkey the secret of
the spring, and on more than one occasion
owed his safety to the wizen-faced little
beast’s sagacity.
At such times Quong did not waste either
thought or sentiment on the poor devils in
the hold, clutching their throats and fighting
for life as the breath was sucked slowly from
their lungs. Sufficient unto the day was
the loss thereof; and the labor also was con-
siderable. The only parties to experience
any joy of the event were the monkey and
the sharks. His master’s unwonted activity
as Quong laboriously carried each of the
freshly-dead Chinamen to the deck and
dropped him overside filled the little ape with
a spirit of unholy glee; and the sharks fol-
lowed the vessel for days thereafter.
Such happenings represented sad moments
in Quong’s life, for, apart from the trouble and
labor involved, he lost the money the now-
dead men would have paid him in the coming-
years had he landed them safely at their
destinations. And the boardings were not
infrequent. To Quong they had become
commonplace. Always the procedure was
much the same. Quong could rehearse the
dialogue in his sleep.
. “What you running?” was the invariable
demand of the revenue officer as he set foot
on the deck of Quong’s junk.
“Dead mans.”
“Don’t you lie to me!”
“Many dead mans.”
“If you lie to me, you diseased offshoot of
a mangy dog, I’ll cut your head off here on
your own deck.”
“Twenty-fi’ dead mans.”
“Onen up, then, and let me see them.’
“Twenty-fi’ dead mans going home to be
bulied,” Quong would reply as he pressed the
spring which opened the sliding deck.
And twenty-fi’ dead mans there would be,
fully dressed, drooped often in life-like atti-
tudes, one against the other, seemingly in
slumber.
“Take yourself and your cargo to 'the
devil, you cursed ghoul,” was the invariable
parting shot of the boarder as he clambered
overside, leaving behind him, oftentimes, a
legacy in the shape of a fist-smash in
Quong’s face.
Not until the revenue boat was quite out
of sight would Quong stir a muscle. Then,
cursing vilely, he would drop a rude sea-
anchor over the stern of his ungainly craft,
and commence the task of feeding his cargo
to the sharks.
* * * *
Quong Hing was running his last trip.
Finding itself able to do its own killings
because of the gradual slackening of its
butcheries, Russia had shipped most of its
yellow executioners back to China en masse,
thus cutting his former stamping-ground
from under Quong King’s feet. For months
he had found difficulty in securing a full
cargo of live Chinamen for the home voyage.
With a competence sufficient for the re-
mainder of his days, made from his former
exploits, Quong found it increasingly irk-
some to haunt the quays and festering by-
ways of Russian seaports in search of would-
be absconders, and the spark of adventure
which once lured him having left him cold,
he had come to the conclusion that the
money was no longer worth the risk involved
in its" making. Let others take up the run-
ning if they wished. His junk metamor-
phosed into a love boat, riding at anchor
in some secluded spot along the banks of
the mighty Whang Ho, with himself as pro-
prietor ready to receive his wealthy kinsmen
seeking temporary sanctuary from the
tongues of nagging wives in the arms of
more tractable companions—this conformed
more to Quong’s newly-acquired philosophy
of life.
As his clumsy craft waddled along home-
ward before a favorable wind, Quong, seated
at the helm, could see in fancy the flower-
festooned decks and towering bulwarks of
his junk as she would appear when recon-
structed. Twelve feet high he would have
the sides of her built, with secret doors for
ingress and exit. From port to starboard
he" would run strings of gaily-colored paper
lanterns which would illuminate the deck,
and, incidentally, light up the huge carved
-dragon he intended placing in the peak to
overlook the revels and lend the correct air
of mystery to the scene. And the monkey
would be there, dressed in red, the love color,
a quaint and living symbol of the frolics. It
was an alluring prospect. Coming after the

Whatever Your Skin Trouble—Get
THE HEALING POWER OF ZAM-BUK. ON
all Cut, Ulcerated., Diseased or Poisoned conditions
of the skin is without equal. Sores and wounds
are cleansed and soothed, and thus the growth of
new, healthy skin (which is fortified against future
troubles) is encouraged.
In the most obstinate and long-standing cases of Eczema,
Ulcers, Poisoned Sores, Ringworm and Piles, Zam-Buk exercises its
curative activities below the surface of the skin, and thus attacks
disease at its source.
This great herbal balm has antiseptic and germicidal properties
that cannot be found in any other preparation. That is why wounds
treated with Zam-Buk cannot take "bad ways."
The absolute safety, constant reliability and the wonderful
healing qualities of Zam-Buk make it a necessity in the home. Every
medicine chest should contain its box of Zam-Buk.
ULCERATED BACK HEALED.
Mrs. Taylor, of 55 Eg an Street, Newtown, Sydney, writes:—■
Some years ago my husband was injured by a fall which affected the
small of his back, and caused the flesh to form into ulcers. He went
into two hospitals, but the doctors could do nothing for him.
As his back was getting worse I thought it best to try other
treatment, so I got Zam-Buk. After perseverance with Zam-Buk
for a little over a month my husband’s back was perfectly healed.”

THE WORLD’S GREATEST HEALER
years of fierce buffeting by wind and wave,
of the ever-present possibility of sudden death
in diverse disguises, of strain and scheming
and hardship, it seemed to Quong a true
haven of refuge, a garden of meditation and
consolation.
Obsessed with liis idea, Quong lashed the
helm and went below to make preparations
for the landing, leaving the monkey on
guard. In two hours they would be out of
the danger zone, if danger zone it could now
be called. With the lessened demand for
the Chinese killers, the Russians had relaxed
their vigilance until the risk of detection
was almost negligible. Not once on his three
previous trips had Quong seen sign of the
revenue men.
It was, therefore, an all the more unex-
pected sight to the evil, grinning little mon-
key perched upon the helm when a man,
wearing the uniform and cap which he knew
and hated, suddenly appeared upon the deck
from nowhere in particular. In two strides
he was at the hold, giving neither time nor
opportunity for the ape’s customary warn-
ing-cry. As the boarder’s hand went to his
hip, action which- beforetime had always
augured ill for his master, the wicked little
eyes of the monkey sparkled and his brain
took fire at the thought that suddenly con-
sumed him. To save his master from detec-
tion was all that mattered. In an instant
he was on the deck and had pressed the
secret spring, closing the hold under the
astonished nose of the raider.
An hour it took them to cut open the
hold. But for once they did not find twenty-
fi’ dead mans. There were 26. Twenty-
six. and a swearing, chattering little ape
which perched on the topmost point of the
bamboo mast and ignored all efforts to entice
him down.
G. L. THOMAS.
Birds of Prey.
[FOB THE BULLETIN.]
IT was easily the most daring aerial
stick-up on record.
For full 26 minutes a long 30-pas-
senger machine, which everyone had taken
to be one of the Ivatoomba Company’s
’buses, had been hovering over the roof
aerodromes of Sydney, while the fashionable
intending-passengers found i themselves being
summarily returned to earth per safety-first
parachutes, after being relieved of their
jewellery and cash.
The name of “Hawk” Tracey naturally
occurred to the minds of the onlookers in
the streets below; but no one was sure, of
course. And while a group of fussy little
aero-police machines kept buzzing around
the suspected pirate-craft, afraid to send it
crashing to earth on account of the passen-
gers yet unlanded, the said \ onlookers found
much joy in watching stout citizens of both
sexes descending, dangling helplessly from
flimsy-looking windbags made of silk.
Meanwhile, 2000 feet overhead, the
Hawk himself was calmly sitting back in
the control cabin of his infamous craft, en-
gaged in airy conversation with a strangely
self-possessed young-lady . passenger with
rather too-golden hair and baffling grey eyes.
He remembered noticing her come aboard in
company with one Lou Dobson, known in
the city below as a financier of sorts; and
now he was pleasantly intrigued with her
undisguised interest in himself, as her cap-
tor, and her flattering unconcern about Mr.
Dcbson —at that moment on deck outside,
being well and truly rifled of all he possessed
prior to being tossed over attached to one
of those same flimsy semi-balloon affairs
made of silk.
"So you’re Hawk Tracey,” she murmured;
“I’ve heard a lot about you from Sparkler
Watts and his crowd.”
“Pleased to meet you,” smiled the Hawk,
moving nearer to her side. "You must be
one of us—or nearly so. Might I ask your
- name?” he added, affecting the traditional
gallantry of the highwayman of fiction.
“Tess Harper,” she replied; “and I’m just
starting to-day as Mr. Dobson’s secretary.”
The aerial corsair removed his cap,
brushed back his crisp, gingery hair with
one hand, sighed, and regarded her contem-
platively for a moment. Then he placed the
other hand unobtrusively upon her shoulder.
“I’ve heard of you, too,” lie softly lied.
Next moment he was toying with her fuzzy
golden hair and the pear-shaped pearl that
hung from her pretty pink ear. The lady
lowered her eyes and remained silent.
“And were you actually going off to the
Mountains with that goofy old mud-turtle?”
presently asked the Hawk, in his best society
manner, as he let his arm fall from her
shoulder to her waist, and applied some
gentle pressure.
“Mr Dobson thinks a terrible lot of me,”
faltered the girl with an appealing pout.
“He’s wanted to marry me for years. And,
anyhow, he’s the only man in the game that
I seem to be of any use to.” She nestled
towards him with a know-I’m-naughty-but-
what-else-can-I-do sort of smile.
At that moment one of the Hawk’s crew
put his head in at the door. “All of ’em
off bar five,” he said; and threw a roll of
notes, a tightly-packed wallet, and * some odd
trinkets on to the small rough table that
almost filled the compartment. The wallet
was marked with the initials “L.D.,” and
the girl’s eyes followed it with interest as
it was swept up and tucked away with the
other loot somewhere inside the Hawk’s
half-open tunic.
“That old bloke’s goin’ off a treat about
his missus bein’ here with you,” added the
newcomer, glancing towards the girl.
His chief gazed at the lady also, a grim,
half-amused look in his eyes; then suddenly
he arose. “We must put him off right
away,” he said. “I’ll see to it myself.”
The other looked surprised, but said no-
thing.
On the deck the portly Mr. Dobson stood,
stout and fuming, ’looking anything but
heroic in the large bun-shaped folded para-
chute fitted to his head —the safety-first
appliance which the Air Board compelled
all aerial travellers to wear. “By God,
Hawk Tracey, you’ll pay for this!” he
almost screamed when his captor appeared.
“What about my wife—and that money o’
mine y’ got in that eab : n?”
The Hawk regarded him with an ominous
glare in his eye. “There’s nothing of yours
in that cabin—get me?” he snapped, step-
ping closer.
"I ‘get’ nothing, you thief!” roared
the infuriated gentleman-crook, who had
been cheated of both his cash and his honey-
moon. "But. you’ll swing for this—you’ll
swing for it!”
The Hawk nodded a signal to two of his
men who were holding Dobson in check, and
next moment that gentleman was hoisted over
the side. But before they let him drop the
Hawk whipped a knife from his pocket, and,
leaning over his victim, paid a little farewell
attention to the ridiculous-looking Air-
Board attachment.
Where money was the prize, the Hawk
took many chances in his profession of
piracy ; where it was a woman, he took none.
Mr. Lou Dobson went shooting through
space, and as the wind rushed up under his
parachute it arose from his head and became
inflated, just as its inventor intended it
should. But as his weight increased the
strain, a small dark mark on the surface in-
creased in length. Next moment it bisected
the inflated balloon; the air rushed up
through the opening with a sigh of relief,
the silken cover split into two shapeless w isps
of silk incapable of holding a breath of air
—and down, down, down went Mr. Dobson
at a terrific speed, growing smaller and
smaller. Now he was but a tiny speck which
suddenly stopped and spread itself I ke a
small burst grape on the white surface of a
roof-aerodrome below.
“Accidents will happen even to regulation
parachutes,” mused Hawk Tracey as he
withdrew his look from below. and glanced
casually up at the small police-craft still
buzzing around him.
Instructing his men to get the others over-
board quick and lively, he dived back to his
cabin, drew a regulation parachute from
under the table, and proceeded to harness
it to his head and shoulders in the approved
fashion. “Now we sink or swim together,”
he grinned, with a glance at his companion’s
safety-first headgear. “At another time I
wouldn’t bother with one of these things.
But the world’s too nice to leave with girls
like you waiting to be cuddled.”
He sat down and drew her to him ; and
while he hurriedly proposed certain glowing
plans for the early future, she idly drew the
cords of his parachute under his clean-cut,
prominent chin, and alternately played with
them and the buttons of his open tunic.
Suddenly something went smack against
the cabin outside, and. a swirl of smoke
drifted past the little window.
“Dammit!” exclaimed the Hawk, jumping
to his feet and rushing to the door. “All
cleared?” he shouted to one of his crew.
“All but th’ lady in with you,” came the
reply. “Looks if th’ p’lice don’t know she’s
there. They’re openin’ fire with their fire-
blobs !”
“Then get under with the engines!” roared
the Hawk. And seizing a knob on the fore-
wall of the cabin he swung it oyer and caused
the arched roof overhead; to divide and swing
back on either side, revealing the open sky.
He then leaped up on to the small table—
which now revealed its purpose as a control
platform—and, seizing his latest pride by
the arm, dragged her up beside him. “Safest
place in trouble!” her shouted above the roar
of the now racing engines, "bhould I say
■Jump,’ lift your foot up on to the deck ana
spring clear.” , . . ‘
On the deek. now level _ with his knees,
stood a cabinet, the top of which lie flung
open and revealed a set of control gears, in
response to his manipulation the nose ot the
machine arose and headed for a higher alti-
tude. "First time I ever let em get the
upper air,” he snapped, glancing at a police
machine Up above him. "But they won t
shoot any firestuff in here, seeing that lye
opened her up just t’ give you a chance to
jump clear,” - .- - -
But the- Hawk had reckoned without the
temper of the too often fooled aerial, police,
for before his white-faced lady-friend could
make any reply, the small machine sent a
trail of smoke whirling towards them just
as it manoeuvred off their course. They both
ducked below the control-cabinet as someth ng
wailed over their heads and landed with a
thud and a splutter in the cabin behind them.
Hot fumes and a smell of burning chemi-
cals arose.
“You ! You !” gasped the indig-
nant air-pirate, and leapt on to the deck.
The girl shot out a restraining hand as
though she would have restrained him.
“Now, jump,” he called, reaching his arm
towards her. . .
“Your —your parachute!” she cried in a
strange choking voice.
The Hawk looked momentarily puzzled,
then leaned down, seized her by the shoulder
and dragged her up beside him, just as a sheet
of flame scorched' the back of her neck.
Snatching a kiss, he flung her overboard, then
followed.
Three minutes later Miss Tess Harper was
being revived with brandy and water admin-
istered by a sympathetic old sergeant of police
on the roof-aerodrome where her parachute
had deposited her.
“I’m sorry t’ say, Mrs. Dobson,” he an-
nounced when the lady appeared to be re-
vived, “but Mr. Dobson ’ad rather serious
accident with ’is parrershoot, an’ —an’ ”
"I know, I know,” impatiently muttered
the lady from behind the handkerchief she
held to her face. “And —and—and what
about that terrible pirate-man?” she asked
with a sob.
The puzzled look that had come over the
honest man’s face on hearing her opening re-
mark slowly cleared and gave way to a look
of jubilation. “Why, he ’ad a bit of an acci-
dent, too !” he announced. “Swung f’r ’is
crime well an’ truly, ’e did. The cords of
’is parrershoot some’ow got tangled under
’is chin on th’ way down, an’ when e’ landed
’e was as dead as Deeming.”
Miss Tess Harper said nothing, and buried
her face in her handkerchief. Her thoughts
were very mixed.
She had lost both men, it was true. Yet
somewhere in the. region of her heart she
retained the best of them. For tucked away
in her blouse were Lou Dobson’s fat wallet
and the plundered valuables of the rest of
the passengers as well, all of which she had
abstracted from Hawk Tracey’s person as
she toyed with the buttons of his open tunic
and the parachute cords under his clean-cut,
prominent chin.
