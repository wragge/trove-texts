BUSINESS NOVEL
A rather weak theme makes a good
peg on which to hang some brilliant
pictures of life in the business world
in The Middle Way, by John McGhee
(Hale), the £2OOO first-prize novel in
the Sydney “Herald’s” last competi-
tion.
The hero is an English bright-boy
sent up from London to establish a
big engineering-works in Scotland. He
succeeds so well that directors on the
board of the big London company,
which runs all kinds of subsidiary
companies, decide to discipline him by
sending up another engineer to learn
the business and eventually take-over,
if not the complete Scottish manage-
ment, at least the key-position on its
production side.
The new man, one Williams, has a
good record as an engineer, but he is
separated from his wife and family,
has been drinking heavily, and he
chases women. No sooner does he get
his eye on the wife of his immediate
rival, Jamie Jamieson, the firm’s best
production-engineer, than he and she
mark each other down, and their affair
winds through the book to a comical
and convincing climax.
Meanwhile the tough old managing-
director comes down with a stroke
while on a visit of inspection to Scot-
land, and knowing that he will have
to give up active control, offers it to
the hero, Jonathan Crane. This brings
to a head Crane’s real worry. He has
succeeded in establishing a big com-
pany, but he wants to stay there and
run it, providing better conditions for
his workers and finer and finer pro-
ducts. He doesn’t want to go to
London and consider the works he
established as just another money-
making machine. He is not, as he tells
himself and as old Brough the
managing-director tells him, sufficiently
ruthless. So the book ends with Crane
retaining control of the Scottish com-
pany and letting the London chance
go hang.
The scenes in the London board-
room, old Brough cutting and cruel,
the rest of the directors hopping-in like
vultures for their advantage, the scenes
in Scotland in which old Brough plays-
off Crane against Williams and
Williams against the sales-manager, are
quite brilliant; but as expositions of
the ruthlessness of businessmen, they
leave the reader wondering how long
the virtuous Mr. Crane will be left
playing Lord Bountiful in his Scottish
job by the gang around the London
directors’ table. On putting down the
book one almost felt impelled to
write Mr. Crane a note: —
Dear Mr. Crane,
If you don’t go forward you go
back. They came at you with
Williams, next time they’ll try with
a better man. You really had no
alternative but to take that London
job.
Maybe this is a measure of Mc-
Ghee’s power to interest at least one
reader. Certainly the portraits of the
main characters, their wives and secre-
taries especially, make you feel that
these are people you have known and
understood, and might even go to
Britain and visit, except that, the book
being now several years behind its
happenings, poor Jonathan Crane is
probably ousted and bankrupt, a new
mob sitting at the directors’ table and
the people Crane tried to hold together
scattered into other jobs with other
companies.
Tahiti to Chile
When Thor Heyerdahl announced
that some of the ancestors of the
Maoris had drifted by raft from Peru
to Polynesia somebody was bound to
assert that they had done the opposite;
and, though he denies that he was out
to contradict Heyerdahl, still less to
“imitate” him, one of those who loudly
proclaimed the opposite was Eric de
Bisschop, a notable denizen of the
South Seas, whose Tahiti-Nui (Collins)
is the story of his raft-voyage from
Tahiti to Chile —or nearly to Chile;
he was rescued in the end by a Chilean
frigate.
Bisschop’s theory, so far as it can
be detected in the midst of his
what ebullient style, seems to contra-
diet not only Heyerdahl’s but all the
other best-known theories, except per-
haps that. of the believers in a lost
continent; for he appears to maintain
that the Polynesians “originated” in
the Pacific and from there voyaged to
all the other places they are supposed
to have come from —South America,
Java, the Persian Gulf and India.
Lacking documentation, argument
and even a clear statement, this notion
cannot be said to shake Heyerdahl’s
or the other theories; nor does Biss-
chop’s raft-voyage prove anything
except that, if it was possible fo drift
from Peru to Easter Island, as Heyer-
dahl showed, it is also possible to drift
in the opposite direction. But no
doubt if you put to sea in any direction,
sitting on a piece of wood, you are
bound to finish-up somewhere sooner
or later. Heyerdahl relied on many
other points of evidence besides the
raft-voyage.
It might at least be expected that
de Bisschop would have written a
book to rival the Kon-Tiki story simply
as the account of a raft-voyage; but,
though at times he does well enough,
on the whole it is amazing how empty
is the sea around him, how uneventful
his long sit on the raft. He seems to
have spent most of his time listening
to the conversations between his radio-
operator and their friends and sponsors
in Tahiti—a form of publicity-
mongering to which he vehemently
objected, but which, nevertheless, gave
him the only subject he could write
about.
Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to meet
Eric de Bisschop and a great pity that
on his return voyage (which would
have helped to reinforce Heyerdahl’s
theories, at least to the extent of prov-
ing that you could drift both ways
across the Pacific) he died from injuries
received when he was wrecked in the
Cook Islands. What the injuries were
or precisely how he received them is
not stated, but it is typical of his
insouciance that he undertook these
mighty and perilous voyages without
being able to swim.
He was, indeed, a character of some
renown. Nothing could be more dis-
arming than the accounts he gives of
his sprees in Tahiti or of the visit his
native wife made him, apparently for
purposes of publicity, when he was
living with his “vahine.” All three
then apparently lived together in the
greatest harmony; and this, says Biss-
chop—unlike most other bishops—is
the way things ought to be. There is,
too, a nice moment on the voyage when
the mermaid climbs aboard and
embraces one of the crew, leaving a

THE LEOPARD'S POUNCE
'T'HE Communists are acting in Asia
on a feline tactic well known on
the fringes of the jungle.
The leopard doesn’t descend in one
long run on the helpless villager
working in the outskirts of his field. He
stalks. He moves forward a little.
When there is a sign that he may be
watched by somebody with a gun he
freezes in ambush. He waits till the
alarm dies-down. Then he leaps
forward again.
The Communists along a line all
the way from the Mediterranean to
the China Seas have been doing just
that over three years past. Syria, Egypt,
Irak, India, Burma —all have been
raided in a way to produce terror and
enhance the prestige of the raider as a
fearsome animal to whom it is better
to submit, the alternative being com-
plete destruction as happened to
oppositions in Hungary, Tibet and Red
China.
The bones of some victims are
already white in the desert of Com-
munism, as in North Vietnam, or in
process of being cleaned, as in Tibet.
Other victims, like the little Baltic
countries and Rumania, have been
completely digested, so that their
present generation has virtually for-
gotten the day when they were not
Communists.
In southern and eastern Asia the
twilight-stalk is on to gobble-up new
victims, and it is being conducted
leopard-fashion. Laos is a typical
example.
It is characteristic of Communist
technique that the menace of the
insurgent forces, with their Russian
and Chinese arms-supplies and their
external leadership, seemed far more
ominous and dangerous a couple of
months ago (when the alarm went up)
than it is now. Yet all the time the
advance has been going on. The
invaders have advanced, halted when
the outcry rose, recruited their strength,
taken another bound. But they have
never turned back, though they have
once or twice appeared to do so. They
have deliberately done everything to
confuse the flabby talkers of U.N. and
to establish by incessant hammering
at the subject that anybody who halts
them is an “aggressor.” That, some-
how, their gradual swallowing-up of a
supposedly friendly territory, protected
by an agreement to which they are
party, is a local affair and therefore
not the concern of U.N.
r pHE charges which the Laotian
A Government has made to U.N.
describe a clear and easily established
set of events.
Since July 16 this year, “foreign
troops have been crossing the border
of Laos” and engaging in action
against garrison-units stationed along
the northern frontier of Laos. These
defensive garrisons have been forced
to resist the attacks, which have
obviously been made from outside,
since if they had not been they must
have been launched against the rear
of the defensive line.
The Laotian defence has been
driven back, has made stands at
strategic points, and then been driven
back again by increased forces of their
enemies who have obviously, again,
been reinforced and acquired renewed
supplies of arms and ammunition from
outside Laos, since they were clearly
not available within its borders.
The piecemeal advances and strategic
withdrawals went on for six weeks,
accompanied by a concerted, cun-
ningly-conceived and well-prepared
world-propaganda emanating from
Moscow and Peking and the local
Communist parties dotted throughout
the free world. This line of propa-
ganda was born in a central
organising-centre and carefully distri-
buted well before the event to ensure
united action.
As the advance in Laos went on
each protest from the West and the
parties to the Geneva agreement and
the Seato alliance was blanketed with
a threatening bellow from Peking or
Moscow warning the natural protectors
of Laos that if they dared to intervene
to assure the observance of the treaties
and the principles of the Atlantic
Charter, they would do so at their
peril. The rebels in Laos were
“engaged in a fight for democracy
against deliberate aggression and
breaches of agreement by the protecting
Powers.”
The Laos Government has invoked
the principles of the Atlantic Charter
and asked for “the prompt dispatch
of an emergency force to halt aggres-
sion and prevent it spreading.”
The response from the invaders was
to mass fresh troops in three areas
while the Russian representative on
the Security Council sought to apply
the veto to the dithering resolution,
useless for all practical purposes,
which the Council proceeded to pass.
It decided—by a vote of ten to one—
to “examine the statements made before
the Council concerning Laos, and
receive further statements or docu-
ments, and to conduct such inquiries
as may be deemed necessary and to
report as soon as possible.”
The first attack on Laos was made
while the world was preoccupied
with Berlin and Khrushchev’s demand
for a summit conference and his
threatenings of West Germany. It was
linked in time and strategy with the
Nixon visit and with the Tibetan opera-
tions. The pause till August 30 was
masked by the incursions into India and
the preparations for Khrushchev’s visit
to Washington. Whenever there was a
move on the Laos front, a new sensa-
tion was developed at a distance from
it to mask it or camouflage it.
TTHERE is no doubt about the
aggression of the Red bloc either
in India or in Laos. And these move-
ments seem to be tied to the visit of
the Afghanistan Premier to Moscow
and Khrushchev’s wanderings, which,
it is now disclosed, will take him to
Peking directly after his visit to the
United States. There it looks as if his
real objective is to condition United
States opinion for what is happening
in Asia and immobilise the U.N. if it
is not already immobilised.
Nehru made the position of India
clear in 1950 after the first Red
Chinese invasion of Tibet: —
The Himalayas lie mostly on the
northern border of Nepal. We can-
not allow that barrier to be pene-
trated because it is also the principal
barrier to India. Therefore, as we
appreciate the independence of
Nepal, we cannot allow anything to
go wrong in Nepal or permit that
barrier to be crossed or weakened,
because that would be a risk to our
own security.
But this statement, ignored at the
time by Peking, seems to have been
empty words. The Chinese now are
actually charging India with aggres-
sion in daring to defend areas which
have long been under its protection
at the behest of the local rulers. They
are treating border defence-posts,
established for a century, as being on
Chinese territory, and, when they get
in their way, wiping them out.
The matter is reaching a stage at
which the free world will have to take
action whether it likes it or not. That
is if Khrishna Menon, who seems to
be the determining factor in Indian
international politics, does not decide
to present the subcontinent to Khrush-
chev when he addresses U.N. Assembly
in a few days’ time.


"HOW?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Britain at the Polls
Eighteen months after the U.K. 1955
election Sir Anthony Eden was a dis-
credited invalid, execrated somewhat
unjustly throughout the world be-
cause of the Suez adventure, the
British newspapers humbly accepting
American assurances that Britain had
been reduced to the status of a
minor Power, with the Opposition at
Westminster cordially subscribing to this
dictum, and content, since it felt that
the blame would fall on the Conserva-
tives and secure for themselves a sweep-
ing majority at the next election, which
they confidently believed to be imminent.
They did not credit that the Conserva-
tive party could remain in office long.
They were doubly cocky because not
only did the Conservatives suffer impor-
tant desertions from the Ministry (in-
cluding their leader in the Lords, Lord
Salisbury, perhaps the ablest man in
British politics), but the Government
seemed to have made the disaster certain
by passing over Mr. Rab Butler for the
Prime Ministership in favor of a man
who was generally looked on as a rather
pawky and unimaginative Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
A lar£e section of the British Com-
monwealth shared the Gaitskell-Bevan
view. It is to the credit of Mr. Menzies
that he stood firmly behind the
Government and showed a staunch
determination to back its policies, to
give it open help and to show unswerv-
ing confidence in its future.
The raising of the bank-rate to an
astronomical height a few months after
Mr. Heathcoat-Amory took office as
Chancellor of the Exchequer was drastic
but effective medicine, and, with a
moderate policy at home, which
kept food and clothing and small
luxuries like beer almost static in price
while wages still rose, as well as the
support of a new Government in Canada
which turned from the American to the
British zone, the Government soon began
to get solid results.
A firm and self-respecting foreign
policy, a viewing of seceding African
and Asian colonies and protectorates in
the right perspective, and a generally
conciliatory programme in foreign affairs
soon restored British prestige. To cap
everything, the gallant attempt —in the
face of the discouraging precedent of
the Chamberlain visit to Hitler —to bring
settlement between Russia and the West
to fruition, finally established the
prestige of Mr. Macmillan and his
followers.
The new Parliament, which will meet
on October 20, will be an important
one. The reasons given for the holding
of a quick election at this juncture are
that “important international negotia-
tions lie ahead, and it is clearly right
that the people should have the oppor-
tunity of deciding as soon as practicable
who are to represent them in these nego-
tiations.”
On their showing in the past few years
it would be a tragedy not only for the
United Kingdom but for the whole of
Western civilisation if the representa-
tive should be the feeble Gaitskell.
Civilisation is still paying for the ousting
of Churchill in favor of Attlee before
the Potsdam Conference.
Inflation and Taxation
It was refreshing to hear Prime Minister
Menzies acknowledging the dangers of
even “two-to-three-per-cent.” inflation
each year when addressing the N.S.W.
manufacturers last week. He was
stressing the point that if inflation con-
tinued people would not support Gov-
ernment loans for public works. And
his theme was that investment in public
works should not be regarded as separate
from investment in private enterprise, as
investment in public works was directly
in aid of the trend of development that
enables industry to expand.
But it is necessary to keep in mind
that much inflation in Australia stems
from the governmental level —from
arbitration-court awards (40-hour week
and “prosperity”-loading) and from the
levying of taxation and in “controlling”
economic weaknesses in a manner to suit
administrative convenience. Govern-
ment “business activities,” too, are
almost invariably high-cost industries
through inadequate control of the staff.
Inflation in itself seems to have some
appeal to the Treasury. It is a fact that
the national debt, which stood at £I3OO
million at the outbreak of World War
11, is now, at £4OOO million, actually
lower when the depreciation of the £ is
taken into account. The reduction has
been through inflation, not through any
administrative economies.
Apropos of inflation’s effects on the
economy, it is to be hoped that Mr.
Menzies’s distrust of it will have some
influence when it comes to the matter
of reassessing the capital of the Post
Office, as forecast by Treasurer Harold
Holt in his Budget-speech. Taxpayers
and users of postal services over the past
years have contributed £4OO million out
of revenue towards the financing of Post
Office capital-works. Holt’s inference is
that this contribution will in future be
regarded as capital, and that an interest-
charge will be passed on to users of
postal services.
It looks as though someone inside the
Treasury or the Post Office is endeavor-
ing to sell the Menzies Government a
pup. That the Post Office has already
had the use of this “costless credit” with-
out a murmur from the taxpayer is surely
enough. To charge interest on it now,
through increasing postal charges, is
unlikely to result in any lowering of
taxation to those who overpaid tax in
the past. More likely is it to perpetuate
those deficiencies of the Post Office that
show-up from time to time when it gets
into the news through a “regulation
strike” or some other crisis with which
it seems unable to cope. And increased
charges for any essential services are
inflationary.
Paying for public works out of revenue
was started by the Chifley Government
with the idea of putting value back into
the pound—or at least keeping some of
the pound’s value in it. It has been
continued on a greater scale by the
Menzies Government. It has always
been thought by responsible economists
that paying for the Snowy Mountains
Scheme out of revenue was also intended
as a counter to “too much money
chasing too few goods.”
To treat this vast and generous—the
total for all departments since 1950 was
£9OO million up to June 30 last, with
another £540 million of Budget surpluses
—contribution from the taxpayer’s
pocket as anything but a counter-attack
on inflation, and particularly to regard it
as a fund that can be in some way
applied towards enabling a rather smug
and increasingly well-to-do Common-
wealth public service to more easily
balance its bulging books, would be the
depth of political hypocrisy, especially
on the part of a Government which, 10
years ago, pledged itself to put value
back into the pound.
Agricultural Education
Ignored
The casual visitor to Sydney, depending
for his information on the popular
press, could easily get the impression
that the most vital questions affecting
education in N. S. Wales are the siting
of tuckshops and whether fat girls should
be barred from entering the teaching
profession.
Important as these matters are, they
are considered by most educationalists
to be less urgent than an overhauling of
the system of secondary-education.
There has been wide interest in the
Wyndham report on secondary-educa-
tion ; there is difference of opinion on
whether the proposed six-year course
should be introduced immediately; there
are partisans for and against selective
high-schools.
For this reason it is rather surprising
that a bill for the Reconstitution of the
Board of Secondary School Studies,
which passed through the House of
Assembly the other day, was unnoticed
by the Sydney press. The new board will
have 18 members. Of these, four will
be appointed by Sydney University ; one
by the University of N.S.W.; one by the
University of New England ; five shall be
officers of the Department of Educa-
tion ; one an officer of the Department
of Technical Education ; one shall repre-
sent non-Catholic secondary boys’
schools; one non-Catholic secondary
girls’ schools; one Catholic secondary-
schools ; three shall be nominated by
Secondary Teachers’ Association.
This seems to be a comprehensive and
representative list. It is—except in one
particular, which was pointed-out by Ben
Doig, Liberal M.L.A. for Burwood—


there is no representative of agricultural-
education. This would be understand-
able if the board were a small one, but
among 18 members the omission is
incredible. Nor is it an oversight; Doig’s
suggestion that the omission could be
rectified, without increasing the size of
the board, by providing that one of the
five nominees of the Education Depart-
ment be a representative of agricultural-
education was rejected by the Minister.
The Cahill Government resents the
charge that it is a Big City Government,
unmindful of the interests of primary
producers. But what can it expect when,
in creating a body which is to determine
the future course of secondary-education,
it completely ignores the agricultural
high-schools and colleges?
Royal Occasion
On September 12, at Tamworth (N.S.W.),
H.R.H. Princess Alexandra of Kent
presented a new 16th Light Horse guidon
to the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers.
The regiment was formed as a C.M.F.
armored regiment in 1948, and is the
custodian of the tradition and guidons
of the old 12th and 16th Light Horse
on which are recorded the battle-honors
won by these two regiments.
The parade at Tamworth was a
mounted parade in armored vehicles —
Staghound armored-cars and Ferret
scout-cars. A mounted armored parade
of this nature is unique in Australian
history ; though it may seem a pity that,
in some way, horses could not have been
used on the occasion—at least, to march-
off the old guidon.
The regiment has recently taken-over
new premises at Tamworth, which have
been named the Beersheba Training
Depot. Among their treasured posses-
sions is a sketch-map of the battle of
Beersheba drawn by Lieut. Massie, who
was then adjutant of the 12th Light
Horse.
Many sons of old light-horsemen of
War I served in War 11, and some still
continue to serve in the 12th/16th
Hunter River Lancers. Present c.-o. is
Lieut.-Colonel John Macdonald, M.8.E.,
of Wallahbadah ; 2 i.c. is Major Ernest
Noel Park, D.S.O.
Drip-dry Interest
New drip-dry no-iron woollen fabrics
are likely to be on sale in Melbourne
next week, although the Australian Wool
Bureau had not expected the new fabrics
to be available for shoppers until next
year.
The C.5.1.R.0., which developed the
process, also had reckoned on an orderly-
marketing scheme next year, but these
ideas were too stately for the keen boys
in the rag-trade, and a few Melbourne
manufacturers have been ready to pro-
cess the cloth for some time
Terence Fogarty, managing-director
of F. R. and T. H. Fogarty Pty., Ltd.,
who runs a sheep-station at Bacchus
Marsh as well as his Melbourne factory,
has been wearing a drip-dry woollen
shirt for many months, and will be one
of the first on the market with the new
fabrics.
The uses of the fabric were originally
expected to be confined to shirts, frocks
and blouses, but have been gradually
extended, since the official announce-
ment on September 4, to the making
of pyjamas, underclothes, children’s and
infants’ wear, and uniforms.
Inquiries about the process are being
receiver! in Melbourne from overseas,
and an export-business may develop in
the interval before it is used abroad,
particularly to the U.S.
No Nonsense!
[From Canberra]
About 20 or so plumbers, electricians
and other tradesmen employed on main-
tenance-work in the Defence section of
the Administrative Building in the
national capital raised a strong objection
when two of their number were grabbed
and interrogated by the Commonwealth
Investigation Service.
The workmates of the two victims
immediately took the matter to the
Disputes Committee of the A.C.T. Trades
and Labor Council, which promptly
declared a black ban on all maintenance-
work in the Defence section.
However, the trouble was resolved,
and the tradesmen went back to work
with an assurance from the secretary of
the Defence Department, E. W. Hicks,
that they would not be subjected, to
police surveillance and that they would
be screened and issued with a pass so
they could work like trusted individuals.
The fuss started after a 22-year-old
plumber had been questioned by officers
of the Investigation Service for allegedly
ransacking wastepaper - bins in the
Defence section.
The plumber claimed that all he
wanted was a piece of paper to put on
some chrome piping so that he wouldn’t
mark it with his footprint-wrench.
Later the Investigation Service verified
this story because there were “footprints”
on the paper.
The other interrogation which spurred
the unionists on to action was the ques-
tioning of a Maltese plumber’s-iaborer
for removing used stamps from dis-
carded envelopes in the Defence section.
Communist Poison
The aftermaths of the A.C.T.U. Confer-
ence, as revealed by correspondence in
the daily press, are illuminating both as
to Communist method and as to the
processes by which the decisions of the
conference were achieved.
The discussion arose through the
industrial roundsman of a Sydney paper
featuring the line that the Com-
munists won because their opponents of
the Right were so extreme and moderate
people will not, in effect, stand
“Macarthyism,” which has become the
double-talk name for any kind of
opposition to Communism among certain
people, Dr. Evatt not excepted.
It is inferred, of course, that it is
impossible to oppose the Communists or
make any searching inquiry into their
operations without indulging in the
almost criminal practice of “witch-hunt-
ing” or “Red-baiting.” It is amazing to
what an extent the Communist party
has made these phrases a talisman
against the exercise of a healthy and
natural curiosity about its operations.
In the discussion it has come out that
all the recommendations, including those
for a closer liaison with Communist
countries and Communist-sponsored
organisations, were endorsed by the
executive of the A.C.T.U. before they
were submitted to the conference, thus
attracting a large blind vote and at the
same time demonstrating how thoroughly
the Communists control the executive’s
policy.
The most heartening thing which his-
tory has to teach in recent years, how-
ever, is that the Communist party has
only to gain control of a body for it
ultimately to destroy its influence, and
eventually the influence of the Com-
munists themselves.
The boring of the Communist party
has brought about the almost
complete collapse of the A.L.P.
four or five times in the past generation.
In Queensland its ascendancy in the
Trades Hall faction of the political party
led to the ruin of the Queensland Labor
Government after it had been in office
for 40 years with only one minor break.
The Miners’ Federation was in the
hands of the Communists during World
War 11, and it had a disgraceful record
of disruption, tyranny and sabotage of
the national effort during that period,
culminating in the strike of 1949, which
gave the coup de grace to the Common-
wealth Labor Government, already on its
sick-bed through adopting Communist
policies of confiscation in relation to
the banks.
The federation today is treated with
contempt by its lodges and members,
who flout all the “principles” laid down
by it whenever it suits them, and con-
stantly rebuff the attempts of its Com-
munist heads to turn to political account
the temporary conditions of unemploy-
ment which arise.
One or two big unions are still under
Communist tyranny —the W.W.F. is the
best (or worst) example, but every month
the Communist leaders find it harder to
get their disruptive tactics carried out
by members, and the union’s power has
been declining steadily since the Hursey
incidents. It has begun to dawn on many
sensible members that it will soon be a
case of no Communist policy or no union
and no watersiders. For everywhere
Communist policy has ended in accelera-
tion of mechanisation and replacement
of men continually on strike.
And the A.C.T.U. is already becoming
another example of what seems to be
a law that any body which surrenders to
Communism may just as well swallow
poison.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
We were approaching the new syna-
gogue at Lindfield, up on Sydney’s
North Shore line, when we heard
chanting. “That traditional music’s
got something,” remarked my com-
panion. “It’s strange, but it gets you,
somehow. There’s a kind of immemorial
sound about it.” Then we discovered
that the vocal efforts came not from the
temple, but from the radio of a house
nearby. The strains were certainly im-
memorial ; they were thrown-up straight
from the libido of a teenage-idol pop-
singer.—“Maitri.”
“Kelenoa”: I wheeled the family off
mild cheese and converted them to
Gorgonzola. Each member sampled the
various brands and the sophisticated type
settled for Danish Blue. The 10-year-
oldster and beplaited retinue burst-in
from school and set about their tradi-
tional afternoon-tea of bread, raspberry-
jam and —cheese. I heard the warning:
“Soft-pedal with the Blue Danube, girls.
It smells from Hell to High Heaven.”

“Tabba”: Fiji may claim the first
newspaper printed in the world each day,
but Worcestershire lays claim to the
oldest. Berrow’s “Worcester Journal”
states under its name: “The oldest news-
paper in the world.” It dates from 1690.

“E. & 0.E.”: Before War 11, large
ads. near small towns said: “Welcome to
Woop Woop. A good Rexona town.”
These ads. disappeared during the war,
but lately I’ve discovered a small,
pleasantly-situated township with what
appeared to be strong literary interest:
“Bracknell, a good Jane Austen town.”
Five streets bore the names of Jane
Austen girls, while a sixth, Amelia Street,
might have derived from Fielding, or
Thackeray’s little goose in Vanity Fair.
The Jane Austen Parade reads: Emma,
Julia (Mansfield Park), Henrietta
( Persuasion ), Elizabeth (Pride and Preju-
dice), Louisa ( Persuasion) and Jane (Pride
and Prejudice).

“Alma”: Denmark, rather than leave
badly-smashed cars at danger-spots (B.

where there have been road fatalities ;
wasted memorials to wasted lives.
“But I tell you, Mother, Babsie always led me to believe it Was

“N.G.A.W.W.”: On one minor point
I would query Walter Brooksbank’s
“The Coast-watchers” (B. 12/8/’59):
where he mentions aircraft being near
enough' for the summoning watcher
“to distinguish their red-white-and-blue
roundels.” Very early in the affair the
red centre had to be eliminated from
the roundel and also from the U.S.A.F.
white star; it could be mistaken
for the red circle of the “rising sun”
of Japanese planes. The U.S.A.F., to
be doubly sure, extended a broad white
stripe fore and aft of the star symbol.
While being trained for “air-warning”
we of the New Guinea Air Warning
Wireless Company were told how one
Nip attack on Moresby failed because
of careful and accurate watching. A large
flight of planes was reported from station
to station heading apparently for Dar-
win. The observer at Daru, the most
southerly of the stations, decided to
watch them out of sight, and at the limit
of vision the flight changed course from
south to north-east. A further warning
was sent from Daru, and a reception-
committee was ready for the visitors
when they arrived at Moresby.
“Barra”: Will wager a grappa to a
flat home-brew that “Meet me in St.

Leonard Nelson’s early-century success
“Meet me on the corner, darling, of the
G.P.0.” Put over the “G.P.0.” version
at a recent evening, and only Mrs. Barra
was aware that I wasn’t singing the

“8.A.K.”: It might console “Peter
Piper” that at least one other bloke
didn’t know “I couldn’t care less” was
not of very modern mintage (B.
26/8/’59). But then, I thought “get
mad,” meaning doing the nut, was an
Americanism ; and “knocked - up,” as
applied to an exhausted moke, was Aussie
slang—until I found both expressions in
Wuthering Heights. “Tough,” designat-
ing a character as being no pansy, is
not the modernism I thought it, either.
Jo, the crossing-sweeper in Bleak House,
was known as “Toughy” in his salubrious
district. And that wasn’t the only sur-
prise in Bleak House. Scribblers of my
calibre don’t presume to criticise the
English of the immortals ; still, I’d like
to hear the purists on “thundered and
lightened.”
CHOIRS AND FAMILIES
“Mr. Arthur Davis, conductor of the Luton
Girls’ Choir, and Mrs. Davis have no family.
‘We have a choir instead,’ said Mrs. Davis.’
I wish it had occurred to me
Not to have a family,
But, more soberly instructed,
To conduct a well-conducted
Choir of forty-seven pure
Young ladies in the song and tour.
There’s not much chance of going wrong
In such a life of girls and song,
For if you couldn’t go to Heaven
To conduct the forty-seven
They might (life’s strange, and there’s
no knowing)
Leave you resigned to where you’re
going.

“Mugga Way”: When the clergy
fall-out on the morality of moderate
imbibing it’s hard for the layman to
decide between bigot and spigot. A
cathedral precentor used to visit
my adjacent club every evening, a
muffler disguising his dog-collar, and
down quite a few pots before returning
to lead the choirboys in evensong or
whatever his duties involved. He was
a cheerful character, and I wish I could
hear his views, between glasses of nectar,
on the eight archdeacons whom the
“unofficial” C. of E. newspaper, the
“Anglican,” described as holding
“muddle-headed and palpably wrong
views” on drinking. He was asked once
in the club if his tolerance on drink
extended to the Ten Commandments and
the Thirty-nine Articles, but in these
respects he held himself thoroughly
orthodox.

one drumstick in one hand, holding the
other in his mouth, and using his other
hand to pick up a tambourine. He put
one foot up on the next step of the

on the drum with the drumstick in one
hand, and beat the tambourine on his
knee. Apparently the drumstick in his
mouth was just in case of breakage. And

“N.C.”: Executive of the South Aus-

has prepared an anthology of writers
born or living in S.A., to come out during
the Adelaide Arts Festival next March.
So many Australian writers were
originally Croweaters or have since come
here to live that the editors had to ex-
clude those who had died before the end
of the war. The publishers are Rigby,
Ltd., of Adelaide, and the design for
the dust-jacket is by Ostoja-Kotkowski,
so it will be an entirely S.A. production.
The only ring-in is Lady Franklin, who
had some pertinent remarks on Adelaide.
At the festival there will be poetry read-

26/8/’59) was the first overseas expedi-

though some Australians did take part.
The force was assembled from British
garrisons stationed in Australia. No
Australian who joined it could have
claimed that he was the first Australian
to fight in a “foreign” war. An Aus-
tralian aboriginal really did fight in
Nelson’s Victory at Trafalgar. My own
family cherishes an unverified story of
an uncle’s participation on the Con-
federate side in the American Civil War
after an unsuccessful role as a fortyniner.
It is certain that several Victorians

Shenandoah as recruits when, with some

“E. & 0.E.”: Air-carriage for mails
everywhere in Australia is the latest sop
to persuade the.public that they will get
something for their sd. But will they?
When Lyons was P.M. he made all first-
class mail travel by air to Tasmania, but
was it faster, or more efficient? In the
early 1920’s I arrived in Melbourne by
boat from Burnie, wrote a note to my
mother, and posted it to catch the re-
turning ferry that afternoon. It reached
Burnie early next morning, travelled an
hour by train, and was delivered round
9 a.m. Last year my daughter flew to
Melbourne and posted a letter to catch
the air-mail at 3 p.m., and it reached


me at 5 p.m. next day—not delivered,
but hot from a private box, as I had
waited while the sorting was done! A
young woman living at Burnie visited
Melbourne last week and was back home
in seven hours —but I’ve never heard of
a letter getting an answer within the day.
Several letters from Sydney, carrying air-
mail postage of 7d., have been two days
en route, as the postmarks clearly show.
They would have come just as soon by
ordinary mail; rail to Melbourne and
then fly across the Straits, at a cost of 4d.
Nearly 30 years ago London celebrated
her millionth telephone-subscriber with a
reduction in the rates. Launceston (Tas.)
followed this by announcing a
record number of subscribers on that
exchange for which rates were im-
mediately increased because this meant
more work for the employees.

put “Spin” junior in the leading role.
Here in New South the yam was a
building-trade classic many years before
that four-year-old earned the baby-bonus
for his poppa. However, “S.” is by no
means the first layman to snazzle a
building-trade classic and add the per-
sonal touch to it. When Hadrian was
building his wall, probably, a bystander
came in with the yarn about the brickie
he’d seen build a toilet, forget the door,
and build himself inside, unable to get
out. Bystanders are still telling if —and
they still don’t explain how the brickie
got the material inside so that he could
successfully build himself in with it.

saw a large van in Melbourne with
“Debt Collectors” prominently displayed

the final form of intimidation the station-

Dollars and A Little Bull
From "BLIK"
T ast week I attended a
weekly cattle-sale in the
heart of one of the N-S.W.
North Coast dairying districts.
The change in the whole set-up
from what I remember of 25
or 30 years ago just has to be
seen to be believed.
No longer are mobs of cattle
driven in by road by thirsty-
looking drovers with tired,
worried-looking dogs. Instead,
big cattle-transports and semi-
trailers in seemingly endless
numbers queue-up to back
into the unloading-ramps to
deliver various owners’ cattle to
the various auctioneers.
Although a truck-driver
may sometimes have up to 10
or 12 loads of cattle to collect
from widely separated districts,
he patiently or impatiently
waits his turn to unload.
Sometimes —particularly on
a big day—a cantankerous old
cow will “go down” in the
truck and resist all the recog-
nised methods used to get
obstinate cows up and walking.
These consist of a few good
kicks in the ribs, followed by
several hefty whacks with a
drafting-cane wherever it is
most likely to undermine her
determination. If both these
methods fail, two sticks
about nine-inches long are
rubbed up and down smartly
along each side of the cow’s
tail, and creates enough fric-
tion to give Strawberry the
idea that her appendage is
being trailed along in a bush-
fire. Only very obstinate cases
fail to respond to this method.
But if they do, the next thing
to try is a political weapon.
Strawberry’s ear is used as a
speaking-tube by the now-
almost-desperate truck-driver,
who bellows out a blood-
curdling roar right into the
ear. Cows don’t as a rule have
the same resistance to such
methods as humans, but if she
still refuses to get up and walk
off the truck, the last resort is
to hold both nostrils until the
breathing is cut-off and she
jumps up to get her breath.
All really pretty harmless,
but even if the cow has always
been a docile old matron she
will almost always viciously
charge the person who has got
her on her feet, or anyone
else standing around.
Although a big proportion of
all cattle are now dehorned,
or sired by poll bulls, some still
have big bike-handle-like,
murderous - looking horns,
which, throughout the Com-
monwealth, cost the cattle-
industry millions annually in
bruising and hide-damage.
Although a man’s life perhaps
hangs in the balance while he
is being charged by a ferocious
beast, the spectacle never fails
to create roars of laughter
from the crowd of onlookers
watching from safe seats. Very
few cattle-sales are held with-
out some animal putting on an
act.
TTnlike the stud-stock sales
held at Royal Shows,
where an admission-charge is
made, buyers and spectators
can attend country sales free.
This accounts for the large
numbers of spectators (called
“sandwich-eaters” in the cattle-
country). Twenty-five or 30
years ago a free luncheon of
cakes and sandwiches was
always provided by the owner
who was having the clearing-
sale. Anyone who came and
partook of the hospitality but
bought nothing was referred to
as “just a sandwich-eater.”
Although free luncheons have
long been discontinued, the
term is still used and looks like
remaining as a picturesque part
of cattlemen’s vocabulary.
The order of selling at most
country sales in the beef selling-
ring is for prime fats (includ-
ing fat bullocks, steers, fat
cows and heifers) to be sold
first. Priority according to
value probably set the order.
VIfHAT a change the American
” export market has brought
to North Coast sales! A prime
line of Hereford steers or fat
barren heifers come into the
selling-ring and bring perhaps
£36 a head. These will all be
consumed on the Australian
or English markets, the reason
being that the quality is too
good for the American export
market, which only requires
second- or third-grade lean
processing-meat for making
smallgoods, hamburgers, etc.
Later on, a line of big, old,
superannuated dairy-cows come
into the ring, varying in age
from 15 to 23 years. Most of
them have just been taken out
of the milking-yard that morn
ing, and to prove it go around
squirting milk from large
pendulous udders in the faces
of those sitting in the lower
tier of seats.
Whilst free milk-shakes for
the sandwich-eaters are being
provided, the auctioneer knocks
the line down for £3B 11s. per
head, and Strawberry, Butter-
cup, Daisy and Blossom start
on their way to America as
boneless beef.
The owner of the prime, fat
steers and heifers gazes with
perplexity at the big-framed,
lean and ancient dairy-cows,
scratches his head and says,
“Well, I dunno!”
Another cattleman whose
prime, fat, medium-weight
bullocks had earlier in the sale
been sold for £54 16s. a head
watches as a big dairy-bull,
with eight or nine years of
stud duties completed, is driven
into the ring. He wonders if
he is hearing right when £7O
is the starting bid, and the
pride of the dairy-herd is
eventually knocked-down for
£lO4. But he knows he’s not
dreaming when other bulls are
sold for £7O, £BO, and £9O each.
A lthough bulls may appear
to be as “fat as whales,”
they are all lean when killed,
and are particularly suitable for
mixing with other meats for
processing, as “a little bull goes
a long way.”
When the dairy-cattle are
sold (at this sale, in another
selling-ring, and proceeding
simultaneously with the “fat”
and “meatworks” sale) any
herring - gutted, bad dairy-
heifer will bring more money
than the well-bred, nice-quality
dairy-heifer.
Things often seem quite
difficult for a stranger to
understand at a country cattle-
sale. One of the difficulties is
to understand what figure
some auctioneers are saying.
If the buyer puts in a bid
which he believes to be for
£25 and the auctioneer’s
account shows: “One cow,
£35,” the purchaser knows that
either the auctioneer needs an
amplifier or the bidder a hear-
ing-aid.
Visitors watching a cattle-
sale are often surprised at the
way the auctioneer will some-
times “hang on,” trying to get
another bid when the price
appears to be already too high.
One bidder may be a big,
well-fed-looking fellow and the
other a quiet, scrawny little
tramp-like bloke.
Whenever the auctioneer
gives a short knock it won’t be
to the prosperous - looking
character, but to the poor-look-
ing, down-at-heel man.
The only difference between
the two bidders, 'as far as the
auctioneer is concerned, is
that the big fellow has a “cow-
cocky’s” farm and won’t pay
for six or twelve months,
whilst the poor-looking bloke
has a few thousand acres, is
down to his last £85,000, and
is waiting at the auctioneer’s
elbow with his cheque-book
almost as soon as the cattle
are ‘knocked-down,’
The extent to which New
Australians have gone into the
cattle game surprises old-hands.
During the war, when butter
and milk prices were pegged,
Luigi and Mario grew
bananas which realised fantas-
tically high prices, as no ceil-
ing-price was fixed on fruit.
Now Luigi and Mario drive
around in the latest-model,
most expensive motor-cars, and
own the best farms or grazing-
properties. The poor old cow-
cocky still comes to the sale
in an old “bomb,” unless he
has acquired sufficient acreage
to go in for some beef-cattle
—all he needs then is a broad-
brimmed hat and he’s in the
grazier class.
If the electoral roll describes
his occupation as “grazier,”
the extent of his mail will
double almost overnight, the
extra correspondence being
appeals for donations from
every worthy cause in the
Commonwealth.


POLITICAL POINTS
Russia’s moon-rocket was apparently
right on target—a fine performance
deserving high praise. But Moscow
missed a chance of doing something
really spectacular. If only they’d put
Khrushchev inside the sputnik and
bounced him back to Washington off
the moon his triumphant arrival at the
White House would have been something
out of this world.

When the Country party endorsed
both Easter and Campbell for the Lis-

Easter, would retain the seat for the

(A.L.P.), 7371 ; Easter (C.P.), 5653;
Campbell (C.P.), 2494.
To win the seat Compton will have
to get 15 per cent, of Campbell’s prefer-
ences. Ordinarily he would not be able
to count on a drift of that size, but this
is not an ordinary election. The rivalry
between the two Country-party men (and
neither as popular among C.P.-supporters
as he might be); the changes in leader-
ship in both Opposition-parties ; and even
the dissatisfaction with the Federal Gov-
ernment over postal-rates are factors
which contributed to the higher Labor
vote. Easter may still hold the seat by
the skin of his teeth. Whichever way it
goes the margin can’t be narrower than
the one which caused the by-election.

How far Granny “Herald” has drifted
into the rude quagmire of democracy
was proved by the belief of one of its
sages that Harold Macmillan did not
address President Eisenhower as “Ike”
(though Eisenhower called him “Harold”)
because “Christian-names don’t come so
easy to the formal British.” In our Sir
James’s day, even the “Herald’s” most
junior cub would have been expected to
know that kings and other heads of
State are never addressed other than
ceremoniously in public, even by their
own relations.

The two Labor parties in Queensland
are apparently both seeking Labor unity,
but they have different ideas as to what
kind of unity they want. Ex-Premier
Gair appealed in the Queensland
Assembly last Wednesday for unity “in
the Labor party and the Labor move-
ments.” He said that if he himself was
a barrier to unity he would be prepared
to stand down provided the principle
of a democratic Parliament, free from
outside control, was upheld and pro-
vided Communist influence was com-
pletely eliminated from the A.L.P.
It was clear, however, that Gair ex-
pected no unity with the A.L.P. as at
present represented in the State Par-
liament. He said the A.L.P. had become
“ a tool of the Communists and Fabians,
the medium of the careerists and oppor-
tunists and the graveyard of tradition
and principle.”
A.L.P. leader Duggan described Gair’s
speech as the dramatic swan-song of a
prima donna bowing-out.

Testifying before the Senate committee
inquiring into road-safety, Professor
Wright, Professor of Physiology at Mel-
bourne University, said he would prefer
a sound-color film taken of the driver
at the time of an accident rather than
blood- or breath-tests for sobriety. He
thought that in the event of a motorist
being picked -up for alleged drunken-
driving the important thing was to get
an immediate record of his physiological
behavior. One-hundred feet of sound-
color film, taken at the time, would give
this.

One sidelight of the redistribution of
Queensland electoral boundaries is that
nearly half Brisbane’s City Council may
be seeking greener fields by next muni-
cipal poll. State electorate boundaries
within Greater Brisbane have always
been adopted by the council as ward
boundaries. If this practice is retained,
six of the 24 aldermen will have no
wards left. With four others, these six
have begun manoeuvring for new wards.
Among the 10 in search of a ward is
Transport Committee chairman Murray
Duus, whose Chermside ward no longer
exists.

“Collins Street”: Vic. A.L.P. executive
has the Federal executive on toast on
the unity - ticket issue. The Federal
executive has refused a request for a
special conference to review the ban,
but the State executive proposes to
ignore the unity-ticket issued for the
A.R.U. elections, and if the Feds, ask
for an explanation, they’ll be told the
election had actually begun before the
directive was issued.
No important union-elections are pend-
ing in Victoria, but if unity-tickets are
issued in the lesser elections, the Vic.
executive will call the A.L.P. candidates
before them, ask if they authorised their
names on the ticket and receive replies

Country-party leader Cutler com-
plained in the N. S. Wales Assembly that
vacancies on trusts of country public-
recreation areas were being filled by
Labor nominees without regard to their
suitability or for local opinion. He
claimed that previous practice had been
to accept the nomination of the organisa-
tion concerned and recommendations
from the local member, and he asked
the Minister for Lands to review recent
appointments which had been opposed
by the member and the majority of
members of the trust concerned. Lands
Minister McMahon retorted that he was
quite satisfied with recent appointments.
No doubt he is, but this habit of
putting Labor stalwarts on public trusts
has been going on for years. It may be
new in the country, but some of the
trusts in the metropolitan area and the
County of Cumberland are so cluttered-
up with Labor boys that their meetings
seem like a roll-call of caucus.

Sketched herewith, Robert Armstrong
Dunn started his banking-career in
August, 1914, with the old Royal Bank
of Queensland at his native town,
Laidley (Q.). He ended it on September
4, after 45 years’ service, as assistant
State manager for N.S.W. of the National
Bank of Australasia. In between, he
served with the Bank of Queensland,
which merged with the Royal and later
with the National Bank, which took-over
in 1922. First he was in Queensland,
then in 1927 he to Sydney, where
he has been ever since, being appointed
assistant State manager in 1956.
But that bit of banking history isn’t
a summarised life-story by a long chalk.
In April, 1916, Dunn took time off
BANKING
to enlist in the A.1.F., and six months
later joined the sth Light Horse in
Palestine. With Major A. G. Boling-
broke’s squadron, he took part in the
battle of Beersheba on October 31, 1917,
when, after the brilliant charge of the
4th Brigade, the regiment was able to
water its horses in the wells of the town.
Later, after the final break-through, the
sth watered at St. Mary’s Well in
Nazareth, and then, as Sir Harry Chauvel
wrote, “had the unique, experience of
joining hands with our late enemies [the
Turks] in protecting them from our
allies [the Bedouins].”
Many Sydney businessmen have been
grateful to Robert Dunn for his counsel
and help, and the Sydney Chamber of
Commerce was glad of his guidance as
councillor (1954-59) and treasurer since
1955. But few, perhaps, heard him speak
about days in the Jordan Valley, when
there was “not a skerrick of balm in
Gilead,” but where there was plenty of
adventure for a young man away from
the bank.
Dr. C. H. Dickson, medical secretary
of the Victorian 8.M.A., which these
days pops-out of its consulting-rooms to
address a few well-diagnosed words to
the populace, has written to the Mel-
bourne press to suggest that the reason
doctors have not been given small
ampoules of Salk vaccine to immunise
patients against polio is bureaucratic, not
medical.
He reports a failure by a high propor-
tion of teenagers and adults to take
advantage of immunisation because they
must go to local council medical-officers,
in groups, at specified times in working-
hours.. The inconvenience dissuades
them; and others are temperamentally
opposed to group-medication.

Mention of Adolphus of Teck (B.
17/6/’59) recalls a yarn about Phil May’s
association with him. There had been
“one of those evenings” at the Savage
Club in A. of T.’s honor when the wine
had been very red and the cigars very
good and members (with Phil last of all)
staggering out into the dawn and claim-
ing their hansoms while holding their
aching heads. No thought of home —of
course. The cool fresh airs of Richmond
Hill and the healing hair of the dog at
the Star and Garter were obviously indi-
cated. So Phil set off through a Sunday
dawn-light West as pilgrims of an earlier
time sought St. Finnan’s Well their
“frenzied dreams to dispel” and their
“crazed brains to restore.” Staggering
into the ever-welcoming bar with scarce
a glimpse at the cloud-wreathed silver
ribbon of the Thames, Phil and the cabby
—Phil was never one to take his medicine
alone—discovered that they had not won
the race. Well-tailored but unshaven
Royalty in evening-dress was already at


the fountain of health. “Ah, May?” says
the Royal Duke genially. “Good-morn-
ing, your Highness,” responds Phil,
“lghness? Oo’s Ighness?” hiccups the
cabby, who had not wasted his night
while awaiting custom. H.H. drew his
card-case from his pocket. “Allow me!”
He presented the cabby with his card.
The cabby for a moment seemed non-
plussed. His eye lit on the Star and
Garter’s biscuit-barrel. His grimy hand
plunged into this receptacle, bringing
forth a noble brown wafer on which
two names were neatly embossed. “And
allow me?” he said, presenting it to the
Duke with a courtly bow, “ ’Untley, not
Palmer . . . That’s me!”

Next month Victorian public life faces
a real loss: the retirement of Sir Arthur
(“Tenny”) Smithers, State Director of
Finance since 1937, when he was the
youngest Under-Treasurer ever appointed
in Australia.
He has given unswerving loyalty to
the succession of Treasurers under whom
he served, and has been respected by
them all ; he is certainly experienced,
since he joined the public service in 1911,
and has been at least helping to shape
Budgets since 1921.
He is also one of the best-known
public servants. He and Lady Smithers
are inveterate and eager first-nighters,
and he is the Government representative
on the National Gallery, a former award-
winning singer, a modest punter, and a
golf and tennis enthusiast. He holds a
number of ex-officio posts for the
Government, and his friends say they
have never seen him ruffled.

who passed on a few years back, was
for long a well-known figure around

black dog. Other links in the family
ramifications were explained in at The
Bulletin by Chafifey, M.L.A., who said
that when his grandfather and three
brothers came from England one brother
settled at Glen Innes, the others at
Tamworth. His own story, in brief:
Going from The King's School to
Hawkesbury, where he took the H.D.A.
with honors and was judged best prac-
tical student and champion ploughman,
W. A. Chaffey went jackerooing for a
time, returned to Tamworth to take-over
a block on Goonoo Goonoo in 1939, and
next year was elected to Parliament at the
by-election following the death of his
father. He was 25 —his father had been
the same age when first elected. Returned
M.L.A.
again at the general elections eight months
later as an Independent supporting the
policy of the Mair-Bruxner Government,
but this time without the U.A.P. endorse-
ment because of his refusal to obey cer-
tain instructions from h.q. in Sydney, he
was unopposed when returned in 1944
while with the A.I.F. Saw active service
with 2/5 Independent Company in New
Guinea, 1942-43; commissioned, end of
’43; joined “Z” special unit, 1944; served
in various un-pacific parts of South-west
Pacific, also Indo-China; and was in com-
mand of a “Z” unit at Jap surrender in
Sarawak (Borneo). In this period of the
war he did a couple of patrols with a
U.S. submarine, and numbers among his
possessions an official letter and the pair
of gold dolphins of a qualified submarine
officer.

ABORIGIANALITIES
'T'he Japan-bound liner from Sydney
-*■ had as commander a red-whiskered
old salt radiating competence and disci-
pline. The ship’s “surgeon” was a young
graduate exhilarated by his first sea-
voyage.
The star passenger, Lady X, a relative
of Lord Inchcape, was, of course, at
mealtimes on the captain's right. She
did not brim with bonhomie nor gre-
gariously cavort with other passengers
at deck-sports. It was regrettable that
during “the captain’s dinner” one balmy
evening off the Queensland coast the
doctor, with paper-cap on top and a
couple of drinks misjudged the
licence allowable on such a festive
occasion by hurling towards the captain’s
table an orange that slightly stunned
Lady X. For that he was next morning
saltily reproved in the captain's cabin,
and the ship then proceeded on an appar-
ently even keel.
Then arose the trouble in Lady X’s
cabin, which the ship’s carpenter fruit-
lessly tore apart to locate what was
reasonably diagnosed as a very dead rat.
The Chinese cabin-steward, cleaning-up
after the carpenter, found the corpus
delicti —a matchbox of stilton-cheese
thumb-tacked under the bunkhead. It
was easy to sheet-home the crime, because
the deucer had seen the doc. one lunch-
time loading the matchbox with its
noisome freight, and the accused cheer-
fully admitted the joke, expounding that
his purpose was to shake Lady X from
her aloofness by showing her that other
voyagers wished her to be part of the
fun and games.
Lady X had been shaken enough, and
"If your experiment is successful , dear, you'll promise to come back ?”

The railway-station Yacca Hill
About three of the morning, first Sunday
in July,
A frost beginning to lie
On the ground;
No sound of movement.
Even the light on the platform still,
Then a long somehow lonely whistle
Crosses the night like a wisp of cloud over
the moon
A nd soon
With a hum and a rumble
A clatter, puff and a hiss
The Mail arrives.
One solitary passenger climbs down,
Goes to the van,
Gets out two ports
And shivering rolls a smoke of sorts.
The guard and the night-officer
Exchange their bits of paper,
“Good-night, Bill,” “Good-night, Peter.”
Flash of a green light
And the Mail shambles off into the night.
“G’-day, mate; you the ne w teacher ?”
“Yeah, Charley’s the name, Charley
McNeil.”
“0.K., Charley. My name’s Peter.
If you’ll just hang on a while
I’ll drive you up town and we’ll find your
room.
Be with you soon.
If there was a moon you could walk
But in the dark
You’d prob’ly break your neck.”
So at his Department’s will
Charley McNeil came to Yacca Hill.

ARE YOU FROM BOWEN?
Two cyclonic disasters in ten
months failed to depress the people
of Bowen, North Queensland. They
have twice cleared the debris, re-
paired the damage and rebuilt
wrecked homes, and the town today
shows few scars of the ordeal it
has suffered. The cyclones have not
stopped plans for the towns cen-
tenary celebrations, which commence
on October 16, anniversary of the
discovery of the port, and continue
until April 12, 1961, anniversary of
the first settlement.
Bowen was the first settlement in
North Queensland, and is looked
upon as the mother-town of the
North. All old Bowenites are asked
to pay a return visit during the cele-
brations, and copies of the pro-
gramme are available from Dr. P. R.
Delamothe, 0.8. E., chairman of the
celebrations committee, Bowen,
North Queensland.

and alongside freshwater and firewood.
It now appears that such visits, made
from Macassar, were to trade with
aborigines for turtle-shell and pearl-shell,
and to employ local labor in diving for
sea-slugs (trepang). But the big riddle is:
who were the seafarers visiting the north
coast of Dutch New Guinea, presumably
to trade for bird-of-paradise skins, so
long ago that their trade-goods axes
and adzes were made of bronze? Quite
a number of these bronze tools have
been found at Lake Sentani, inland from
Hollandia, the latest lot a few weeks ago.
But one I handled—and tried in vain to
buy—was found by an American and
was in a different class. It was a 4in.
piece of a two-edged bronze sword-blade
which had been sharpened at one end
to turn it into a blade for a native adze.
“I tell you it's Thursday—not Friday !”
And it wasn’t found in the Dutch section
of New Guinea, but 600 miles further
east at Cape Gloucester, New Britain.

“Mulga Ned”: Among other con-
tributory causes to the fame of the late
Clement Wragge (B. 26/8/’59) were
his prediction of the devastating drought
of 1902. Also, it was under his auspices
that the official attempt at artificial
rainmaking took place during the same
drought. As a youngster at Charleville
(s.-w. Q.) 1 remember the rusting frame-
work of two “rain-guns” which were
employed. They were funnel-shaped
barrels, from which explosive charges
were hurled at the clouds under Wragge’s
directions. According to the yarns of the
old-timers, the firing of the charges was,
in fact, followed a few minutes later by
a few drops of rain, which sent the
hysterical crowd pubwards in premature
celebration of Wragge’s successful ex-
periment. Apparently Wragge himself
drew no false hopes from the attempt,
for he never pressed for a repetition.
A fter a night of high winds and
torrential rain a farmer here in W.A.
went, in some trepidation, to see how a
sow which had farrowed the previous
evening was faring. Her yard was like
a miniature lake, but she had retreated
to one corner ot it. There she lay
stretched-out, and, ranged side by side
a J} er k a( -k, w^r . e offspring,

“Mugga Way”: With the lordly (in
the air) albatross suffering the mild
indignity of being “tagged” to allow some
private-eyes in C.5.1.R.0. to probe its
love-life and journeyings, the picturesque
little fairy-penguins can hardly complain
that similar action is being taken with
them in Tasmania. Feather-light
aluminium-tags will be fastened to as
many flippers as possible, and finders
are asked to leave the tags on live birds
but to report tag-number, time and place
to the zoology department of the Tas-
manian University. For some time the
Tasmanian muttonbirds have been
tagged, and so have rat-kangaroos. An
earmarking plan is being considered for
Tasmaman-devils—but the problem there
1S first to catch the devil,

“Angus McScupper”: Geographical
prepositions (B. 19/8/’59) are fairly
predictable. One lives in a country and
also in a town unless it is so small that
no one reasonably imagines himself con-
tained by it, and so Jim O’Brien lives at
Upotipotpon. An island, or any water-
side-home, involves on, also used for
mining-fields and physical features such
as plains, plateaus and mountains. If
you domicile someone by a river, sea
or lake the faint inference may intrude
that he fishes off the front porch or is
doing a spot of beachcombing. But
(living more dangerously), why is it
always a punch on the jaw but a punch in
the kidneys?

“Jock”: Whenever I see a well-dressed
man-about-town wearing suede shoes I’m
reminded of my days in the “compul-
sories”—universal military training they
called it —before the 1914-18 war. We
young heroes were issued with a type
of boot that carried longer “fur” than
the present-day suede shoe. Horror of
horrors, it was dyed an anaemic pale
yellow! We used to call ’em teddy-bears.

“H.G.L.”: Regarding R. A. Howell’s
record at the Brisbane Show (B.
26/8/’59), how about beating mine? I
hadn’t seen an Exhibition from 1901 to
’38 —just on 37 years. My last 10 years
had been on an island off the nor’-west
coast. There, in those days, the only
time a man wore boots was when he
went to a town on the mainland. I
hadn’t been to town more than three
times in those 10 years. And one of the
first jobs I had when I reached Brisbane
was to do the Show for the A.B.C. That
entailed eight full days, on the job all
the time, on my feet almost the whole
time, in shoes which hadn’t grown as
much as my feet had during their 10
years’ freedom. Sufferin’ hell! That
expresses it fully. And I repeat the
challenge: Beat that and play fair!

“Judee”: The N.S.W. Electricity Com-
mission is running into a snag with the
immense Vales Point power-station on
the shore of Lake Macquarie. It pro-
poses to seal-off the mouth of Mannering
Bay and use the 390 acres for ash-
dumping. Professional fishermen say this
will destroy one of the few fish-nurseries
left in the lake. They say the C.5.1.R.0.,
worried about the depletion of the State’s
estuarine fisheries, recommended that the
headwaters of bays and inlets in the lake
be preserved, because they were “teem-
ing with small fish.” The researchers
reported also that the bottom of the
lake was a desert; only 24 per cent, of
the 22 square-miles of water produced
food necessary for fish-life. The argu-
ment is expected to spread into State
Cabinet.

“Kaytee”: The glorious certainty of
the uninformed! A long - experienced
vet., in the course of investigating in-
fertility in cattle, noticed on a dairyfarm
a cow with a bursa (membranous bag
of synovial fluid) on one knee, and,
thinking it might be a localised brucella
infection, offered to test the cow for
brucellosis. The cow-cocky agreed ; just
as the vet. was getting out his King
bleeder the cream-carter arrived, and,
informed of what was happening, he took
one look at the cow and said positively:
“She ain’t got brucellosis!” whereupon
Daisy’s owner said, “Well, if the carter
says she hasn’t got the disease, we won’t
waste time testing her!” and he promptly
bushed the cow.


'T'rochus-shell fishing, which started
■*- 60 years ago, and in which as many
as 50 luggers were simultaneously
engaged, has finally succumbed to the
cheaper-made plastic button. The last
lugger, the Sari Rizah, of Mackay (N.Q.),
has furled her sails, with an unsold
7 tons of shell which formerly would
have brought £540 a ton. Forty years
ago, to cope with the business, Japs
were building luggers at Thursday
Island at the rate of five a year.—

“Pat C.”: Mary Bishop’s “Let Sleeping
Cats Lie” aroused nostalgic memories.
Of the many fummies we’ve had, three
individualists stood - out. Ginger, a
marmalade, adopted me during an even-
ing stroll and stayed for many years.
Then we replaced the much-battered
fly-wire on our sleep-out, thus depriving
him of means of slipping in and slipping
out. Ginger, apparently offended, there-
upon disappeared, never to return.
Sambo —probably the best of them;
faithful, affectionate and agile—would
invariably greet me each morning with
a display of “victory”-rolls as a pre-
liminary to getting his belly scratched.
Archibald (a gift from a barmaid) defied
every cat-tradition. When he collected
too many fleas he was given a bath.
After that you couldn’t keep him away
from water —in winter he’d paddle, and
in summer amuse himself by ducking
under the garden-hose.

“Quartercut”: The tree-order Arau-
cariacece always had a far-flung diversity
of virtues. Plywood technicians say that
for their craft the world’s best wood
derives from this prickle-leaved order
be it Brazilian parona, Queensland hoop
or New Guinea klinkii. For Binghi,
bunya-cones supplied such a wealth of
nutritious seeds that the tribal rights to
every tree were meticulously defined.
Conchologists, researching the lamentable
dearth of that superlative soup-maker,
the New Zealand toheroa, report that
this unique crustacean thrives best in
beach-sands moistened by fresh-water that
has seeped through ground-deposits of

the monarch of all Araucariacece —

LOAMING ON THE GOLDFIELDS
TZeteran prospector Jock Walls and his
* mates, Voumard and Edwards, have
a reputation on the Kalgoorlie goldfields
for finding rich gold. Their latest strike
has been at Ryans Find, on the track
through mighty lonely country from
Southern Cross to Goongarrie, where
they got 180 oz. from 2cwt. of rock, and
followed that up a few days later with
lOOoz. from another small parcel. They
think there’s more to come.
“Oh, no! We haven't always been cantilevered out. Our block used to
extend out to where that big Wave is breaking."
They use the loaming-method, by
which a lot of gold has been won in Aus-
tralia. The system is based on the fact
that all rocks exposed to frosts, winds,
rain and other such weather-weapons
are eroded—reduced to particles of vary-
ing fineness. These particles form the
loam in the vicinity of the rocks they
came from ; and if any of those rocks
are gold-bearing you’ll find that gold by
washing a sample of the loam.
The modem method is to take the
water to the loams. A 200-gal. tank on
the back of an old truck holds enough
water to keep a thrifty prospector operat-
ing over a wide area, and having the
water mobile speeds the job and makes it
incomparably easier.
It can’t always be assumed that the
richest sample from a loam indicates the
richest lode. A lot depends on the type
of rock from which the loam has been
thrown. A comparatively poor sample
in loam which has come from quartz
might indicate a far richer deposit than
much higher values found in loam from
a softer rock, which would erode at a
faster rate.
After finding rich loams you’ve got to
locate the centre of the gold-bearing
area. Having recovered a sizable
“corner” of gold from a loam the pros-
pector concentrates on the area from
which it was taken, washing hundreds of
loams taken from about 3ft. apart in
every direction, until the outer limits of
the rich area are mapped. He now has
a plan of his loams, with values increas-
ing along certain lines meeting in one
small area. A close examination of that
area will show where to dig ; and when
a loaming-prospector starts to dig he
knows he’ll strike some gold. Maybe not
much, but some.
G ne important point. On a slope,
even a steep slope, it mustn’t be assumed
that al j the gold from the lode wiu be
downhill from the mother - rock.
Naturally most of the eroded, rock will
be downhill from the lode, carried by
wind and water; but a certain amount
will also have been blown uphill. The
prospector mustn’t be surprised if values
are richer below where he first found
color from a loam. On the other hand;
the gold directly below the loam may well
be coarser than that above, coarse grains
almost invariably moving downhill,
Loaming involves work, both before
and after findin the rich loam but it
saves a lot of work> tooj and anyone
using this method on any recognised
goldfield will almost certainly find some
gold. He won’t always strike it as rich
as they’re getting now at Ryan’s Find,
but those men are experienced prospec-
tors, and they know gold-country like a
stock-dealer knows horseflesh. But, even
a t t hat, they’d be unlikely to strike these
rich pockets consistently without the
loaming-system

STAYERS AND DARK HORSES
CJharemarkets continue to be
extremely strong, overall,
in Australia, even if occa-
sionally showing slight ragged-
ness in spots. Company
reports now coming to hand
by no means harmonise with
the great upsurge in share
prices ; even though there are
pleasant surprises here and
there, there are at least an
equal number of disconcert-
ing results coming to light.
Some of the younger, more
vigorous and more enterpris-
ing concerns which have been
making the most out of what-
ever good thing they have got
onto are often doing fine.
Among these have been
Bramble’s Industries, L. J.
Hooker, Minster, Ltd. (West-
minster Carpets) and Reich-
hold Chemicals; but more
representative companies have
not shown the same spectacu-
lar results. Many companies,
indeed, though they have
shown higher aggregate profits,
have not maintained their rate
of earning on greater capital
employed. This has been
noticeable in the hire-purcase
section particularly.
A number of companies, of
course, have “come good” with
bonus-issues following varying
periods of plough-back. Among
those which have not kept
shareholders waiting too long
have been the holding-cos. in
Australian Gypsum Products
Pty.—namely Australian Gyp-
sum, Victor Electric Plaster
and Peninsula Plaster—and
James Stedman Henderson,
David Syme, R. Fowler and
McDonald Industries. Those
which have been prodded into
action—and then have gone-
off like a delayed-action bomb
include Adelaide Steam,
Richardson and Wrench, Aus-
tralia Hotel and (it would
appear) Burns Philp.
Both Bradford Cotton Mills
and Davies Coop have reported
setbacks in profit-earning, and
the latter has reduced its divi-
dend. On the other hand,
Yarra Falls has shown an im-
proved profit, and has main-
tained its dividend at 8 p.c.
Australian Woollen Mills,
which vies with Yarra Falls
for leadership in the Aus-
tralian woollen-textile trade,
does not bring-out its profit-
figures until later, but the
sharemarket has taken the
“Keep the change !”
hint and bid up to 335. 6d. for
its ords., of which many
thousands changed hands at
around 255. earlier in 1959.
A.C.I. had a good year, but
not a spectacular one, and
B.H.P. reported varying con-
ditions in its own particular
market, though the output of
basic steel was up on that of
the preceding term. On a
turnover up a little under £1
million at £15.4 million, John
Fairfax, Ltd., controllers of
Sydney “Herald,” “Sun,”
Sunday papers and weeklies
(and financier of the “Daily
Mirror” purchase), showed net
profit £204,107 higher at
£810,343, representing an
earning-rate of 20.3 p.c. on
capital. The div. has been
lifted to 13 p.c. (compared
with 91 p.c. in the previous
year). Figures of Amalgamated
Television Services have been
incorporated in the consoli-
dated accounts for the first
time this year, but it is unlikely
that they have, at this stage,
had much effect on the
increase in profits.
Stimulated by the increased
profit, and by rumors of
further moves in the Sydney
daily-paper field, John Fairfax
£1 shares shot-up to a record
83s.
The bloom has gone off (or
is going off) the boom in the
cases of chain-stores, hire-
purchase stock and TV-manu-
facturing concerns. But it
most decidedly remains on the
TV - transmission companies,
although these have so far
very little to show for them-
selves. The one public excep-
tion has been Television Cor-
poration, Sydney, which
appears to be ahead of the
other big-city transmission-
companies in profits even if
not in quality of programmes.
Australian sharemarkets, in
summary, remain in an
intensely speculative mood, and
in the rush to be “in” on any
takeover possibilities, yields
from particular stocks have
been trodden into the ground.
There is undoubtedly a feel-
ing that this country is just
“rearin’ to go” industrially,
which is probably pretty near
to the truth, but in picking
one’s horses in this industrial
race it will pay best to select
obvious stayers, and to keep
the “dark horse” and the
sprinter in proper perspective.
And, whatever the horse, some
regard must be paid to the
odds —that is, to the yield,
present or prospective. That
is' the ultimate yardstick by
which stocks will be valued.
King Island Scheelite
Tll7ith tungsten prices at such
** suddenly higher levels,
the big question among mining-
share operators last week was
whether King Island Scheelite
would reopen its tungsten-mine
in Bass Strait, closed-down
since August last year, when
tungsten was around 70s. per
unit. It is now around £7 10s.
(sterling) per unit, apparently
as a result of fears about the
continuance of supplies from
China and South-east Asia
following the troubles along
the Indian border and in Laos.
King Island Scheelite made
its big profits during the period
in which it had a lucrative,
long-term war-time and post-
war contract with the U.K.
and U.S. Governments, entered
into when tungsten was around
£25 a unit. Even at the end
of 1956 tungsten was worth
£l3 a unit.
It is unlikely that King
Island Scheelite will reopen its
Bass Strait mine unless the
price for WO3 goes higher
still and looks more secure, or
unless it is offered a profitable
long-term contract by some
Government agency. The
gathering of a new staff and
their establishment on King
Island could not be done at
the drop of a hat.
Compared with the London
price of £7 10s. sterling (£9 7s.
6d. Aust.), all-in costs of pro-
ducing wolfram at the mine
were about £lO ss. a unit in
1957, and thev would be
higher now.
R. and W. and Lend Lease
A t the special meeting in
Sydney on September 10
shareholders in Richardson and
Wrench, Ltd., showed a strong
inclination to reject (by 467
votes to 74) the L. J. Hooker

On the other hand, it was dis-
closed that the offer of

£6 2s. 6d. cash made by Tel-
ford Simpson, chairman of
R. and W., had been under-
written by Lend Lease Cor-
poration, Ltd., and that its
chairman, G. J. Dusseldorp,
had accepted a seat on the
board of R. and W.
Mr. Dusseldorp has now
said that his company will buy
any number of R. and W.
shares for £6 2s. 6d. cash or
seven Lend Lease stock-units.
The offer will remain open
until 14 days after the annual
meeting of R. and W. to be
held in 1960.
Dusseldorp also said that
R. and W. was a keystone in
the Lend Lease network of
agents. H. R. Crammond,
who acted as chairman in the
place of Telford Simpson,
said R.' and W. was negotiat-
ing to take-over two city real-
estate firms and one in the
country. In addition, it was
leasing portion of its premises
on a new rental basis, and
these moves should enable the
co. to pay 20 p.c. after the
one-for-one bonus-issue.
R. and W. have also been
approached to act as advisers
and consultants to two new
land-trusts about to be floated.
Lend Lease Corp. was
formed in March, 1958, under
sponsorship of Civil and Civic
Contractors Pty., which has
operated in Australia since
1951 as a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of Bredero’s Construc-
tion Co., Ltd., one of the
largest construction concerns
in Holland.
Civil and Civic has carried
out building-contracts for the
Snowy Mountains Authority,
and, after their completion,
flats and houses in Canberra,
and built the Australian
Academy of Science there. In
Sydney it erected Caltex
House, the North Shore Medi-
cal Centre, home-units, fac-
tories, other constructions, and
has been engaged in land-
development. It has been
awarded the first construction
contract for Sydney Opera
House. It recently extended
its activities to Melbourne.
Lend Lease was formed as
a financing medium for Civil
and Civic, which took-up 40
p.c. of the initial capital. The
Mutual Life and Citizens’
Assurance has come-in both
on a share and loan basis.
Lend Lease is also interested
in “retained ownership of
selected portions of completed
buildings to be let on lease
with the object of ultimate
sale at enhanced values.”
Its panel of “sole estate-
agents” in Sydney are Richard-
son and Wrench, Hardie and
Gorman, Richard Stanton and
Sons, Sidney Raper (all of
Sydney); D. M. Scott Pty.
(Edgecliff) ; Cox, Dudley and
Rowles (King’s Cross) ; and
Chambers Real Estate (Mos-
man).
When the present issue of
£300,000 of first mortage-
debenture stock is completed
Lend Lease will have share-
holders’ funds of £256,738 and
borrowings and other liabilities
of £751,689. Largest asset is
land and buildings and work-
in-progress of £406,281. Its
10s. stock-units stand at 425.
on ’Change.
With the entry of the Civil
and Civic group into the
Sydney construction and real-
estate business there was
bound to be a collision between
Lend Lease and Hooker’s in
the end. Hooker’s have been
going from strength to
strength, and with the flotation
of their first land-trust in so
short a time, and a second one
well on the way, other real-
estate people have become
concerned, for although it is
generally claimed for land-
trusts that they will deal
through any real-estate-agency
that offers them attractive
realty, agents are unlikely to
offer property to a land-trust
that already has a prominent
estate-agency company as its
adviser and agent.
R. B. Davies Industries
{~\ne of the more disappoint-
ing industrial shares in
the marked economic advance
of the past five years has been
R. B. Davies Industries, Ltd.,
controlling from Sydney the
largest builders’ - hardware
organisation in Australia. Its
venture into Yorkshire Fittings
(Australia), Ltd., was entirely
successful, but recently this
holding of 149,000 £1 shares
was disposed of at 375. 6d. a
share, and brought-in £275,625.
The money was partly used
to repay £200,000 of note-
borrowings ahead of maturity-
date, and partly to repurchase
(for £50,000) of a freehold sold
to Yorkshire when it first set-up
business. The co. in 1957-58,
with the help of an increased
distribution from its holding in
Yorkshire (Australia), lifted its
div. to 8 p.c. again from the
7 p.c. to which it had fallen
in 1957.
The co. pays only one divi-
dend a year, and the shares
now carry whatever distribu-
tion is coming for 1958-59.
Recently, partly because Ray-
mont Moore is chairman (and
because several of the cos. he
chairs have made bonus-
issues), the shares have risen
from below par to 255. It is
unlikely that any bonus-issue
is in sight from R. B. Davies,
but general investment interest
has been quickened by the fact
that it has just bought-out (for
cash) Hardware and Hinges
(N.Z.), Ltd., Auckland, which
will be expanded to cover a
full range of builders’ hard-
ware in Maoriland.

acquire the ordinary share-
holding in Corser and Co., 15
more hotels will be added to
the brewery chain. The offer
of three Queensland Brewery
£1 ordinary shares for every
five Corser and Co. shares
gives the shareholders of
Corser and Co. the par-value
for their holding on present
market-value of Queensland
Brewery shares. Profit last
year of Corser and Co. was a
bare 3.94 p.c. on capital, in
spite of a dividend-payment of
5 p.c. Corser’s shares sold at

Company-finance Trends
Tn delivering the Annual
Endowed Lecture (spon-
sored by the Australian Society
of Accountants) at Sydney
University on September 10,
Melbourne stockbroker A. C.
Goode spoke on “Trends and
Developments in Company
Finance.”
When he entered stockbrok-
ing in 1935, said Mr. Goode,
there was already a well-
developed industrial section of
the Stock Exchange list, but
it was significant that even as
late as that date buyers of
industrial shares, unlike those
of mining shares, were not
charged a buying brokerage, as
an encouragement to buy
industrials. At that time there
were virtually only two
alternatives widely used in
capital-raising. One was by
the use of ordinary-share
capital, and the other by rais-
ing preference capital. There
were a few debenture-issues,
but this method was not popu-
lar either with companies or
with investors. World War II
inevitably brought great
financial changes in its wake.
There has since developed a
greater financial maturity in
Australia.
In the field of company-
finance, said Mr. Goode, the
most important motivating
factors arising from the impact
of the war were:
(1) High taxation.
(2) A greater awareness of
the continuance of infla-
tion.
(A large part of the changes
which have since occurred can
be ascribed directly to these
first two factors. Taxation
and inflation soon succeeded
in overcoming the opposition
of company-boards to the use
of debentures and subsequently
of notes of varied descriptions.
The interest paid on these
prior charges is an allowance
for tax purposes, while there
is an assumption that repay-
ment will subsequently be
effected in a less valuable form
of money on the maturity of
the securities)
(3) A change of banking
policy. For example, the
restriction of lending to
hire-purchase companies
was the greatest factor
in developing the h.-p.
side of the short-term
money-market.
The interest-rate applied to
the pure note [that is, not con-
vertible or otherwise qualified]
its usually higher than that
required for a debenture or
for a convertible note. Such
notes provide the highest
money-income available with
adequate security in the market
today.
The rates must be high
to attract to them the money
of investors who are just as
aware as are the directors of
the borrowing-company of the
inroads of inflation. If, for
example, inflation continues at
the rate of 6d. in the £1 per
annum — i.e., 2\ per cent, per
annum —it is logical that the
return from a “pure” money-
stock should be 2\ p.c. p.a.
higher than that available
from a security giving a right
to real things— i.e. ordinary
shares —and this margin is
more than shown by the pre-
sent divergence of yields in the
market as between the various
groups of securities. From the
company’s viewpoint, this is
more than counterbalanced by
the allowance of the interest
payable as a cost for tax
purposes.
The Stock Exchange and
those of its members interested
in underwriting are traditionally
the avenue in Australia
through which a large propor-
tion of company-finance is
obtained. In the first instance,
when most companies are
introduced to the Stock
Exchange, opportunity is taken
to raise additional equity-
capital. When the level of
Stock Exchange prices is high
and the market is buoyant, as
at present, it is not difficult
for companies of reasonable
size and background to be
formed into public companies
and, in fact, to strike a fairly
hard bargain with the incom-
ing public.
Within reason, the “harder”
this bargain the cheaper the
capital so obtained. The
reasoning behind this can best
be shown by the example of a
company which a few years
ago might have felt impelled
to offer a prospective dividend
of 10 per cent, and today could
indicate 6 or 7 per cent, with
as great a confidence of suc-
cessful flotation but with a
somewhat different capital-
structure. The same changes
have, of course, been the
means by which most public
note- and debenture-issues of
the “pure” variety have been
obtained, and little difficulty
appears to be offered in such
raisings which are well sup-
ported wherever the name of
the borrowing company is a
good one and the terms are
appropriate.
In the case .of note- and
debenture-issues, Mr. Goode
added, subscription is
normally obtained either by
advertisement directly from
the public or from the public
in their role as clients of the
various brokers. It is interest-
ing to observe that most of
these applicants appear to be
holders for the full term of
the notes or debentures. In
other words, they apply with
the intention of holding to
maturity, and, no doubt, of
converting if appropriate terms
of conversion are then offered.
Despite the number of note-
and debenture-issues since the
war, the supplies which are
available for sale in the
market are negligible. So little
interest is apparently evinced
at this section of the market,
as a market, that it is seldom
press recorded.
There does seem some
scope for some widening
and development of this
market, which will become
increasingly important to the
success of various note-issues
as the applicants for them
become more knowledgeable
of the Stock Exchange.

OPERA WITH A DIFFERENCE
T ike Menotti’s famous “The
Consul,” Australian com-
poser James Penberthy’s “Dal-
gerie” is opera with a difference.
The former has been accused of
being a drama with musical
interpolations ; the latter could
be called a narrative poem set
to music. But such distinctions,
or purist quibbles, don’t detract
from the vital impact of either
work, each in its own way.
Stefan Haag’s productions of
both these works —especially
his world premiere of “Dalgerie”
—at the last Festival of Perth
are not likely to be forgotten
by those who saw them. “The
Consul” was superb; “Dal-
gerie” had a haunting quality
that increases with time. It is
excellent that the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust has obtained the
rights to “Dalgerie” and pro-
poses to foster world interest
in it.
Penberthy was inspired by a
poem chanted by the native girl
in Mary Durack’s novel Keep
Him My Country ; and, having
worked on this theme, he per-
suaded the author to write a
libretto so that he could develop
and extend his scope.
Cut down from the achieved
length during production, on
the first night the opera
undoubtedly left a faint sense
of something lacking. It
seemed particularly necessary
to have more singing, especially
an aria for the male lead, who
was heard only in association
with the soprano. This lack
has been remedied in the now-
extended time from 60
minutes to 80. One hopes the
new aria will come at the tense
moment when station-manager
Stan Rolt finds himself de-
prived of Dalgerie and faced by
the power of traditional beliefs
—a situation that seemed to
call for more emotional expres-
sion than an attitude struck
against the leading corroboree-
dancer.
The inclusion of corroboree
—in Perth performed by abori-
ginal dancers —was enormously
successful. The beautiful
handling of this scene, the
imaginative use of strange, fear-
some shadows —as also the use
of a gauze set painted in
ghostly baobab-trees for the
prelude made supremely
beautiful pictures.
If the work goes abroad it
is to be hoped that Stefan
Haag’s lighting-plan and Eliza-
beth Durack’s set-designs go
with it. The simplicity of the
“That’s our local sergeant’s home.”
sets —or set, rather, since the
gauze supplied the sole change
—was masterly, achieving
with the greatest economy a
perfect illusion of the Aus-
tralian Far North, the very
essence of isolation.
Nor could one wish for any
other singer than Joy Mammen
as Dalgerie. Apart from her
beautiful voice, she displayed
herself as a competent and
subtle actress. Blonde Nordic
though she naturally is, she
became in every movement —
even in her laughter—a young
lubra who knew nothing
beyond the limits of a cattle-
station, the plains and moun-
tains of her own country.
But opera is music. Shortly
after the “Dalgerie” season
John Farnsworth Hall, con-
ductor of the Westralian
A.B.C. Symphony Orchestra,
who was musical-director of
the opera as well as conductor,
remarked that, although he had
always been keenly interested
in Australian composers and
their works, the music of “Dal-
gerie” was the first to speak
to him with a truly new voice,
a voice that could rise only
from this continent.
Penberthy’s music is by no
means imitative of native
rhythms or chants. Never-
theless, the lovely haunting
theme of the song “Keep Him
My Country” lingers in the
ears with its strange melody—
if melody is the apt word for
a refrain that drifts, as it were,
from the back of time.
Overseas, despite its melan-
choly, this opera could implant
in distant minds something of
our Australian North; for
melancholy is the other face
of the North’s sunlight and
freedom. It is the melancholy
not less than the splendor that
holds in thrall the memory of
all who know it.

Stage and Music
Musica Nova
At the Con. last Saturday
night the Sydney branch of the
International Society for Con-
temporary Music let its hair
down two Australian first-
performances and a Sydney
first-performance.
The big work was Schoen-
berg’s “Pierrot Lunaire,” a
musical setting of 21 poems by
Albert Giraud. Schoenberg, in
following his maxim that music,
in order to develop, could not
continue to be merely subser-
vient to a literary text, uses
a solo voice to declaim the
verses in a curious sing-song
fashion. Initially this treatment
of the words —reminding you
strongly of an elocution-lesson
in German —is rather strange ;
but Giraud’s ultraviolet poetry
actually gains in effect, because
the recitation stresses the rich-
ness of the words; and the
orchestra, far from being an
independent, inferior accom-
panimental instrument, weaves
itself impressionistically around
the solo voice.
Fortunately patrons got a
complete translation of the 21
poems, otherwise they might
have missed the full combined
flavor of words and music. In
“The Dandy” the opening line,
“a phantasmagoric light-ray,”
becomes a ghostly shriek, with
the words elongated and terri-
fying ; “A Pale Washerwoman”
is pale and fifthy of texture ;
and “Waltz of Chopin” is
virtually an essay in atonalism
—but Giraud’s lines “So this
music is pervaded by a morbid,
deathly charm” is a rather
risky generalisation.
In “The Waning Moon” the
flute underscores the text, and
most happily, too, for a straight
flute-part can remind you of
moon-colors; and in “Sere-
nade” Schoenberg allows
humor to seep through his
modernistic meanderings.
Two of the 21 poems are
especially interesting: “Night,”
a passacaglia based on a three-
note phrase reappearing in
almost infinite guises; and
“The Moon-fleck,” a double
mirror-canon between piccolo
and clarinet on the one hand,
violin and ’cello on the other ;
and on top of this there is a
three-part piano fugato as well
as the free voice-part.
If there were occasional
shortcomings conductor
Richard Meale’s preoccupa-
tion with the score sometimes
affected the total balance, and
once or twice clarinettist
Peter Kyng appeared to be
worried —the whole thing rose
above the experimental, giving

a fascinating glimpse of con-

Marilyn Richardson, the
solo voice, was at all times
neatly assured ; and the other
people —Gregory Elmaloglou,
’cello ; Peter Richardson, flute
and piccolo ; Lois McAllister,
violin and viola ; and Nigel
Butterley, piano — were very
good indeed.
Other works on the pro-
gramme: “The Blackbird,” by
Olivier Messiaen, (Sydney first-
performance), clever pro-

piano, studded with lush
chords of the 17th and 19th ;
it needs, one feels, to be com-
pressed, and there is some ex-
tremely fidgety writing near the
end; “Sonatina,” by Daniel
Ruyneman (first Australian
performance), again for flute
and piano ; three movements,
ranging from grave to gay to
pensive, the last movement set
to classical tonality ; and Mil-
haud’s polytonal four-move-
ment “Sonata” for flute, oboe,
clarinet and piano.

Luton Girls' Choir
Any man who can, at a snap
of his fingers, get 47 girls aged
between 15 and 24 to come
from attention to the hand-
clasp position with a split-
second precision that would
bring a grunt of approval from
a barrack-square sar’-major
can lay claim to being a
disciplinarian of some calibre.
But that was only a minor
aspect of the tight control used
by Arthur Davies, the famous
choir’s founder, conductor and
director, at the Luton Girls’
Choir’s opening Sydney con-
cert at the Capitol Theatre last
Thursday night.
Conducting from the piano,
he obtains fine effects of tone-
blending between altos and
sopranos, nowhere better than
in delicate decrescendos. The
girls’ attack is crisp and clean ;
they obtain admirable effects
of nuance and phrase, and they
have one virtue which few
choirs achieve: crystal-clear
enunciation.
One of their most appealing
numbers was “The Skye Song,”
with the nostalgic evocation
strong. The “Nun’s Chorus,”
lacking a strong soprano
soloist, was less satisfying.
Exultation was kept within
bounds in the final bars, of
“The Holy City”; and the
touches of humor, as in a pot-
pourri of nursery-rhymes,
gained from clever use of
the low voices against a lighter
filling-in by the sopranos. And
whether it was a jolly Scottish
air or a number by the choir’s
old friend Richard Tauber —
all directed to middlebrow
tastes —it was done with work-
manlike efficiency. The con-
cert as a whole was adroitly
stage-managed, though some
of the conductor’s compere
humor needed a retread.
The solo voices were only
passable, but there were two
charming examples of duo-
work : the lovely “Serenade”
from Bizet’s “Fair Maid of
Perth” and the number from
Humperdinck’s “Hansel and
Gretel.”

Alma Trio
The two concerts this Ameri-
can ensemble gave in Sydney
for Musica Viva more than
confirmed the excellent impres-
sion they made during their
first visit to these parts 18
months ago. The pleasure their
music-making gives is like that
of the finest minor poetry —no
disturbing or exalting revela-
tions perhaps, but always a
vital, thoughtful, balanced
and devoted craftsmanship:
the sort of work you can take
a lot of.
These qualities were no-
where more abundant than in
Schubert’s spacious and singing
E Flat Trio and the red-
blooded Beethoven B Flat on
the first programme; and in
the delicate Mozart E Major
and the broad and complex
Brahms B Major on the second.
Only in a couple of move-
ments —notably in the jovial
finale of the Brahms C Major
in the first concert —did the
players fail in their quest for
fullest expression; and there
were a few moments in the
second concert when the
strings briefly lost their sheen,
leaving only an arid precision ;
but against this the group
sometimes found a memorable
stream of lyricism, as in the
double second movement of the
Brahms B Major and the
reflective middle section of
the Brahms C Major, and most
of all in the surging and soar-
ing later movements of the
Ravel A Minor which con-
cluded the second concert.
Members of the trio were:
Maurice Wilk (violin) ; Gabor
Rejto (’cello); Adolph Bailer
(piano).
Artbursts
Royal Art Society
It is not in the nature of
the N. S. Wales Royal Art
Society to be surprising, since
its general aim is a quiet
fidelity to Nature in her less
surprising moods; but the
current exhibition at the Edu-
cation Department galleries
does provide at least two
moments of the unexpected.
One is a watercolor by
G. _ K. Townshend, “Land-
scape, Mona Vale,” which is
not only an excellent water-
color, but, being a lovely
clean sweep of green hill,
doesn’t look at all like his
usual grey landscapes. It is
an essay in simplicity, and a
very fine one.
The other surprise is two
oil landscapes from the B.irds-
ville Track by Max Ragless,
quite different in style (though
still rather poster-like) from
his watercolors or from any
of his .previous oils which
this commentator has seen. In
one of them he has painted
“Mungerannie Creek” with a
very pleasant decorative effect
and plenty of the local heat;
and the other is a most
unusual attempt to paint a
mirage. To a connoisseur of
the Birdsville Track his earth
here doesn’t look stony and
red and purple enough, but
his orange sandhill floating in
steely-blue mirage is exactly
right, and there is a nice feel-
ing of space in it.
For the rest, if not surpris-
ing and with a considerable
amount of work ranging from
the pleasant-enough to the
fairly-awful, the show has
moments of quality in the oils
by Lance Solomon, Leonard
Long, W. H. Hibble and
Carlien Parker (“Child Por-
trait”) and, among the water-
colors, in John S. Loxton’s
“Grey Day, Eden,” Mary
MacGregor’s “Wild Cotton”
and Mollie Flaxman’s “Sala-
manca Place.”

The competition is not
thrown open to artists gener-

obvious that the committee has

general to younger painters in

such older, experimental prac-
titioners as John Passmore.
Besides Passmore, whose
abstracts aren’t as alive as the
fishy landscapes he was doing
a year or two ago, the select
company are Arthur Boyd and
his deadly brides; Charles
Blackman, from Victoria, with
big caricature-like silhouettes
not unlike those of Bob Dicker-

whose “The Front Bencher” is
a pleasing satire on a large

of color intended to be an
“Image of Kalgoorlie”; Jon
Molvig, of Brisbane, who calls
his brumbies and other pieces
of Australiana “ballads,” an
appropriate term for the large,
loose, mythological bush-

attempting these days; and

and skilful abstracts, except
for the one on the right, are
looking a shade mechanical.
Films
“Member of the Wedding”
By one of those strange
coincidences which sometimes
occur in the film world, this
sad comment on American
marriage appears on the same
programme at the Australia,
Melbourne, as “The Mating
Urge,” a rich, rosy-purple
American documentary on the
love-rites of other lands.
The business of obtaining
a wife in other lands, it
appears, is surrounded by all
sorts of strange conventions —
though few of them are
stranger than our own. In the
New Hebrides, for instance, a
young man doesn’t court his
girl with orchids or a front
seat at the opera—nothing so
sissy. He climbs to the top
of an 80ft. tower and, to prove
his courage, lashes jungle vines
to his ankles and hurls him-
self headlong to the ground.
“As a Marxist-Leninist, Comrade, you will prove that
the bourgeois concept of heaven is just a reactionary
plot to deceive the Workers."
He either breaks his neck
because his vines are a foot
too long or he is deposited
more-or-less badly shaken at
his admiring girl-friend’s feet.
With dozens of prospective
bridegrooms flinging them-
selves from the tower and
dozens of potential brides
gazing at them with apprais-
ing eyes, this makes the most
impressive piece of photo-
graphy in an otherwise innocu-
ous film.
In the other film a wedding
is also depicted. There
are the happy bride and the
bridegroom and the parson
and a best man and brides-
maids and all the other appur-
tenances of a proper marriage.
Into the ceremony bursts a
little sister crazed with dread
of losing her beloved brother,
and she wrecks the whole show
by demanding to be included,
even to the extent of sharing
the honeymoon with the happy
couple. Weeping and scream-
ing, she is forcibly detained
by her father while the bridal
car drives off.
There is, of course, no way
for her to be included in any
Western matrimonial arrange-
ment, but there would have
been if she had been born
into a matriarchal society like
the one in “The Mating
Urge.” The head of the
household, a stout old lady,
already has two-dozen child-
ren, but it is her duty to have
a dozen more, for every baby
is a potential worker. So
she “marries” a fresh young
girl. The girl becomes her
de facto husband. She then
invites the co-operation of
some handsome young fellow
to provide, without obligation,
the needed offspring. There
are plenty of young men
ready to oblige.

“The Valley of Peace”
There is beauty, poignancy
and warmth in this Yugoslav
film (with English sub-titles)
about the tragedy of children
in war. The simple story,
realistically told, amounts to a
powerful indictment of war
and its attendant miseries, and
the black-and-white camera-
work is of a very high order.
A nine-year-old boy and a
five-year-old girl, orphaned in
an air-raid, set-out to find a
valley, which the little girl’s
grandmother told her exists,
where there is no war and no
bombs. On the way they meet
an American Negro airman,
who, shot-down, is trying to
make contact with the Parti-
sans. He accompanies and
protects them; they reach a
valley ; but the airman, flushed
from their refuge in a farm-
house by a German patrol, is
killed in the subsequent
skirmish between the Ger-
mans and the Partisans. The
children, again bereft, set-out
for another valley as illusory
as the last one, in the vain
hope of finding peace in a
world torn by war.
The growing mutual affec-
tion between children and
airman is conveyed with in-
sight and sensitiveness, and
there are such moving scenes
as when the small girl, watch-
ing the airman bury his dead
captain, devoutly inters her
headless doll nearby.
Negro John Kitzmiller is
authoritative in both aspects
of his role: as resourceful,
ruthless escapee, and as kind-
hearted protector of the
children, who are played with
delightful naturalness by Tugo
Stiglic and Eveline Wohlfeiler.

“Geisha Boy”
Given a script with plenty
of situations made for slap-
stick, Jerry Lewis, aided by a
faceful of goofy expressions
to draw upon, can usually run
the header through a bumper
crop of laughs. In this opus
he has a basically good set-up:
he is a small-time magician,
Tokyo-bound to entertain
U.S. troops, and he starts
brilliantly by rocking a snooty
film-star (Marie McDonald)
literally to her foundations
when everything but those
essentials comes off in a
scuffle on a plane’s landing-
steps, with a battalion of
press-photographers on hand.
Though he fails to sustain
the fun on this level, he yet
manages to stretch the risible
muscles of his audience to
some effect. Had the script-
writers been less eager to get-
off some Jap-American good-
will propaganda by burdening
the comedian with some
sentimental twaddle about a
Japanese boy, and given him
more work with his box-o’-
tricks and his rabbit, this one
could have been a winner.

The WILD CAT

Broken Hill Proprietary
/"Vver the past 10 years the Australian
manufacturing industry has almost
doubled its capacity. Expansion is not
limited to a mere rise in volume. Even
more important is the steadily increasing
production of a much wider and more
complex range of goods.
With a paid-up capital now almost
three times that of the second-largest
Australian company, B.H.P. has long
been a cornerstone of secondary industry
in Australia.
The B.H.P. group dominates the steel
industry, and the wide scope of its acti-
vities allows a better and more rational
utilisation of its resources, making for
considerable economies of large - scale
production.
The parent co. itself operates a com-
pletely-integrated steelworks at New-
castle, N.S.W., a melting-shop, a slabbing-
mill and a hot-dip tinplate plant at Port
Kembla, a blast-furnace at Whyalla,
S.A., producing pig-iron for general
foundry use, and a merchant rolling-mill
at Kwinana, W.A.
A second fully-integrated steelworks
is operated by the major subsidiary, Aus-
tralian Iron and Steel, at Port Kembla.
The group mines iron-ore at Iron
Knob, near Whyalla, S.A., and at
Cockatoo Island in Yampi Sound, W.A.
Pig-iron is produced at Newcastle, Port
Kembla and Whyalla.
The group turns-out well over three-
million tons of steel-ingots a year, builds
ships of up to 19,000 tons (and now the
Ampol oil-tanker of 32,250 tons) at the
nation’s largest commercial dockyards
at Whyalla, and makes hot - dipped
tinplate at the rate of 85,000 tons
annually. In the previous year the out-
put of tinplate (the first recorded)
totalled 39,482 tons. Average Australian
consumption of tinplate is 133,000 tons
a year, and it is intended to supply all
of this from Port Kembla as soon as
possible.
Subsidiaries and associated cos. process
steel in various parts of Australia and
are of great assistance in stabilising
earning-power. Among their products
are: wire and wire-products, galvanised-
iron, steel pipes, special steels and
alloys, stainless-steel, tungsten-carbide-
tipped tools, steel fence-posts, cement,
oil-drums and hot-water systems, road-
making materials, zinc-oxide, hand-tools
and nails.
Noteworthy is the A. I. and S. con-
tinuous wide hot-strip mill opened in
1955, which produces basic strip for the
manufacture of galvanised-iron, car-
panels, refrigerators, washing-machines, a
variety of building-materials, and many
other items. The opening of the mill
was an important milestone in the
growth of Australian economy.
Independently - owned and -operated
steel firms depend on the B.H.P. group
for their supplies of raw-materials. Coated
and uncoated steel-sheets are produced
by Lysaght’s Works Pty., Ltd. (not a
subsidiary), at one plant at Newcastle
and two plants at Port Kembla from feed
obtained from B.H.P. and A. I. and S.
Two independent re-rolling mills roll
sections from billets obtained from
B.H.P. Another independent rolling-
mill produces alloy steels and sections
from the melting of selected scrap in
electric furnaces. Three cos. draw
bright - steel sections from shapes sup-
plied by the group.
The production of steel ingots and
output of the blooming-mill expanded
considerably during the year to May
31, 1959:

Demand for steel has been fairly well
in keeping with the trend of 8.H.P.-
group production, but there has been a
slackening in orders for most pipes,
galvanised-iron, steel fence-posts, and
fencing-wire. The setback in wool prices,
and adverse seasons, affected rural
demand. Pig-iron for foundry use was
in slacker request. The buoyant demand
was for structural sections (reflecting
city building activity, among other
things), bars and rods, and for strip and
steel sheets.
Exports of iron and steel have been
rising, and have tended to balance the
cost of steel-imports. Direct imports in
1958 amounted to only 7 p.c. of total
steel consumption, compared with about
30 p.c. five years ago.
However, B.H.P. earnings last year
did not benefit materially from export
sales. The satisfactory profits earned
reflect the expanding capacity of the
home-market.
Consolidated working profit was dis-
closed at £39,308,119 (up £2,622,937):

B.H.P. continued its policy of allow-
ing liberal provisions for depreciation
and plant-replacement, while making
massive outlays on new plant. Con-
solidated provision for depreciation was
£11,260,240 (up £1,135,225), while the
allocation to plant-replacement absorbed
£6,200,000 (up £80,000).
Taxation provision was £11,851,683
(up £354,717), leaving the consolidated
net profit at £10,183,075 (up £1,110,233).
Total disclosed consolidated net profit'
(with £31,836 profit from assets sales)
represents an earning-rate of 10.7 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds (against 11.1 p.c.
in 1958) and 20.1 p.c. on the enlarged
average share-capital.
At ruling rates, the £11,851,683 tax-
provision considerably exceeds the re-
quirements for the £10,214,911 disclosed
consolidated net profit. The present tax:,
profit ratio is 3:5. On this basis, con-
solidated net profit would be £31,604,488
(disclosed £22,066,594) before tax and
£19,752,805 (£10,214,911) after tax. On
these, necessarily very arbitrary, figures,
consolidated post-tax earnings represent
38.8 p.c. on average share-capital.
Dividend-rate remained steady at 8y
p.c., but capital-increases raised the div.
payout by £585,662 to £4,239,114.
In 1958 251,727 20s. ords. were issued
in acquisition of minority interests in
Lysaght Bros, and Australian Wire
Ropes. Also, in 1958, an additional
8,846,847 ords. were issued at par
1 for 5.
A further issue at par (applicable to
current term) of 10,616,216 20s. ords.,
1 for 5, payable 10s. on application by
June 15 and 10s. by December 15, 1959,
was announced on March 6.
On June 26 it was decided to acquire
the one-million-odd fully-paid A. I. and
S. 20s. prefs., by exchanging 7 fully-paid
B.H.P. 20s. ords. for every 10 A. I. and
S. prefs. This exchange will facilitate
some current administrative problems.
The effect of these capital-moves will
be an increase of paid-capital to
£65,458,123 when the new issues are
finalised.
Loans on mortgages went up by


£3,439,740 to £15,675,000 during the
term, indicating that the co. is able to
borrow cheaply away from the market
instead of making public note-issues.
Total reserves increased by £5,694,845
to £38,564,553, excluding £21,150,000 (up
£6,200,000) provision for plant-replace-
ment :

The increased shareholders’ funds and
borrowings, ploughed-back profits and
various provisions will be used to finance
further solid lumps of expenditure on
capital-works, which will require about
£26 million a year, for at least the next
several years.
Last year the consolidated book-value
of plant and machinery increased by
£13,714,797 (after depreciation) to
£106,854,071. Freeholds and leaseholds
showed a book-value increase of £979,795
to £3,571,522. This indicates a visible
capital-expenditure of £25,954,832, add-
ing back the provisions for depreciation.
The most notable addition to the co.’s
productive-capacity during the year was
No. 4 blast-furnace, commissioned on
May 28, 1959. Its iron is needed to supply
the additional open-hearth steel-making
capacity installed at No. 2 melting-shop
at Port Kembla. Last March the third
furnace in this shop was commissioned.
The erection of a second sinter-plant is
under way.
As part of expansion, of the subsidiary
Commonwealth Steel Co., a plant for
cold-rolling of stainless steel was com-
missioned. The plant will render Aust-
ralia self-sufficient in cold-rolled stainless-
steel, effecting a considerable saving in
foreign exchange.
The shipbuilding programme a t
Whyalla will keep the dockyard fully
occupied for some time. Plans for the
32,250-ton oil-tanker are well advanced,
and orders were received for two 16,400-
ton-d.w. bulk-carriers.
The S.A. Parliament had ratified the
plans for development of Whyalla as a
centre of steel-making and rolling, with
assistance from the S.A. Government.
B.H.P. is likely to introduce a new oxygen
process for steel-making at Whyalla.
Prospects of fatter divs. depend mainly
on a reduction in the rate of ploughing-
back of profits into expansion. There
is some indication of a levelling-off of
profit-retention over the next few years'.
Here there is a conflict between the
principle of “div.-justice” to shareholders
and the requirements of national
economy, in the growth of which B.H.P.
has played such a dynamic part.
At present shareholders must be con-
tent with a modest immediate yield of
2.5 p.c. on their 20s. ords. which last
changed hands at 675. They are looking
for further capital-increases, and seem
likely to get them.

attractive new headquarters at Hunter

what lower in rate, in total profit broke
all records to reach £200,175 (up £55,258)
after tax £119,929 (up £43,199, and
closelv aligned to profits) and deprecia-
tion £16,728 (up £9403):

Earnings were equivalent to 23.4 p.c.
on average capital, as against 27.6 p.c.,

Dividends were maintained at 15 p.c.
and took £128.494, with reserves benefit-
ing by £87,469 (to £285,814). Today
the co. presents a wide and diverse range
of interests. Its ramifications, in fields
beyond the h.-p. horizon, go a long way
towards ensuring stability of future
earnings.
The co., formerly Latec Investments
Pty., was formed in 1953 to finance the
sale of motor-vehicles and the like. To
begin with, 700,000 ss. ords. were issued,
paid capital at June 30, 1954, being
£175,000. In August, ’54, an issue of
500,000 new shares brought paid capital
to £300,000. This was shortly followed
by a three-for-four par issue in January,
’55, paid capital as a result rising to
£525,000. In the same year the sub-
sidiary, Seven Seas Insurance Pty. (now
Seven Seas Insurance Co., Ltd.), was
formed. Its business at first was confined
to insurance referred to it by the parent
co. Today, however, with branches in
Sydney and Brisbane, its activities extend
to all phases of insurance except life
assurance. Profits so far have been
satisfactory, but to date no distribution
has been made to Latec, in favour of
building substantial reserves, which is
sound policy for a young office.
In 1957, four more subsidiaries were
registered: Latec Finance Pty. (to take-
over and undertake all h.-p. activities);
Florida Hotels Pty. (to operate the newly
opened Florida Hotel on the ocean-front
at Terrigal—Latec’s first venture into
fields entirely unassociated with h.-p.);
Clearview Estates (to effect subdivisions
for the parent co.); and Master Motors
Pty. (to engage in the panel-beating and
motor-repair trade). Master Motors
handles a considerable amount of in-
surance work for Seven Seas Insurance,
and has a growing private clientele as
well. It also runs a service-station.
In 1958 Southern Hotels Pty. was
formed, and took-over the Lake Illawarra
Hotel, Windang (N.S.W.), a going con-
cern which the directors expect will con-
tribute substantially to profits. About
the same time, a property was bought
not far from Master Motors and car-
wrecking was started under the name of
Wickham Car Wreckers.
Early last term shareholders were
again offered a par-issue—1,050,000 ss.
ords. on the basis of one-for-two. In
March, ’59, Cash Orders of Queensland,
Ltd., was taken over. Six Latec shares
were given for each 20s. ord. in Cash
Orders, the deal involving a further issue
of 903,000 Latec shares. Together, the
two issues lifted paid capital to
£1,013,250, at which level it remained
till last balance-date.
Latec Finance (Queensland) Pty. was
also formed last term —it did not com-
mence business until the present term.
With offices in Brisbane, Bundaberg and
Rockhampton, its operations embrace
motor-vehicle and other large h.-p. busi-
ness, together with general finance as
distinct from the smaller type of trans-
actions sought after by Cash Orders.
True, some increased activity should
attend the development of TV-services
now in process of establishment in Perth,
Adelaide and Brisbane, and prospects
for the h.-p. industry generally remain
quite sound ; but, equally, the spectacu-
lar profits achieved by h.-p. cos, till now,
may not be continued. Competition
must intensify, for the cream has already
been skimmed from the market, and,
to a greater degree than before, new
business will be gained at the expense of
rival organisations.

vigorous diversification policy
as implemented by the directors
since the co.’s inception. The
wisdom of this “spread of
interests” should be tested in
the not-too-distant future. The
volcanic upsurge of h.-p. fin-
ance is tending to level-off, the
volume of repayments to
financiers, as a whole, is now
running not far below that of
new business, and boom spend-
ing is likely to be followed by
markedly reduced borrowing—
people will consolidate their
position by paying-off existing
debts before incurring new
ones.
Finance-cos. charge interest
to consumers at a flat rate, not
an annual rate. By expressing
the amount set aside by way
of unearned income as a per-
centage of moneys due on
current h.-p. contracts it be-
comes possible to gauge
whether or not the co. is mak-
ing sufficient deduction from
earnings, of charges, etc.,
relating to future periods. As
a general principle this figure
should not be less than 10 p.c.
In the case of Latec, unearned
income at £704,798 (up
£242,449) is 11.2 p.c. of
“debtors and cash.” In it-
self a satisfactory percentage,
it is in fact even more so, since
the item “debtors and cash”
includes not only amounts due
under contract, but also sums
due by non-h.-p. debtors. Un-
fortunately the extent of the
latter is not indicated, but
advice from the co. reads as
follows: “This percentage is
lower than last year (14.2 p.c.
in 1958) due to a higher per-
centage of debtors without
future charges and also due to
the inclusion of Cash Orders
Queensland, Ltd., debtors.
Cash Orders Queensland, Ltd.’s
main business is cash-orders
and short-term h.-p., so that
the provision under this head-
ing is lower than for a normal
h.-p. co.”
Another pertinent ratio is
that of borrowings to share-
holders’ equity. The co. has
raised the greater part of its
funds by successive issues of
deposits and registered notes.
At balance-date debentures and
notes stood at £4,432,589 (up
£1,939,320), equal to 3.4 times
shareholders’ funds and as such
typical of not a few cos. in
the h.-p. business.
The co.’s wide and rapid ex-
pansion is reflected in the book-
values of freeholds and lease-
holds and plant and furniture.
At balance-date both groups of
assets were more than double
the previous year’s figures. The
former at £785,791 was up
£441,664, and the latter at
£217,725 was up £123,324.
Provision for unexpired insur-
ance risks was ample, and at
£219,094 (up £11,932) repre-
sented 83.9 p.c. of the net
premium income for the year.
Insurance suspense account
rose by £15,955 to £44,830.
Considering the greatly
increased volume of business
attending the group’s activi-
ties last year—£7,058,067, as
compared with £5,099,003 in
the preceding term —hefty in-
creases in sundry creditors and
bank-accommodation were not
surprising. Sundry creditors,
which includes the provision
for taxation, leapt £205,716 to
£384,220, and the bank over-
draft advanced £67,652 to
£286,040. Stock, formerly of
minor significance, assumed
importance and at £57,556 was
£46,332 higher than the year
before.
Already in the current term,
further expansion has been
undertaken. The whole of the
issued capital of Confidential
Investment Pty., Melbourne
h.-p. financier, was acquired
earlier this month in exchange
for 247,000. ords. and £15,000
of 10 p.c. registered deposits.
Shareholders can look forward
with reasonable justification to
additional par share-issues, but
it would perhaps be a little
too optimistic, in the light of
present growth-acceleration, to
expect anything more than a
continuance of the present
level of div.-rates.
Investors today are paying
10s. Id. for the co.’s ss. shares.
At this price yield is 7.4 p.c.
from a continued 15 p.c. div.
At balance-date each share
had a tangible asset-backing
of 6s. 5d

/"\ver the last 15 months this
small but energetic real-
estate and building-investment
co. made smart progress.
Provided all share-offerings
are taken-up, paid capital will
be more than quadrupled
before the end of the month.
Originally the woe-ridden
Simon Hickey Industries, Ltd.,
the old show was taken-over
by real-estate interests in
April, 1958. Following a
major reconstruction, a fresh
start was made. On May 7,
1958, the Simon Hickey paid
capital not covered by assets
was cancelled. Subscribed
capital was reduced from
£40,000 in ss. ords. to £BOOO
in shilling shares. The balance
of £32,000 was used to write-
off capital losses incurred in
shares and advances to Simon
Hickey and Sons Pty. Follow-
ing the reduction in capital,
shareholders were offered the
right to subscribe for two
additional shares of Is. each
for each ord. held. This new
issue was fully subscribed, and
paid capital was raised to
£24,000. At the time of recon-
struction the name was changed
to Stocks and Holdings, Ltd.,

BEEF-CATTLE
IN AUSTRALIA
"Country Life" Photo.
HEREFORDS ON TUREE STATION, COOLAH, N.S.W.
Australian secondary industries have
made significant progress in the last 20 years, the
economy of the Commonwealth is still based on primary
production. As long as the population continues to
increase at the present rate, Australian primary produc-
tion will be required to keep pace with the demand from
our greater numbers. More than that, the matter of
providing external funds for the country rests still on the
export-markets available for our pastoral and agricultural
products.
Wool has been the stand-by of the Australian
economy for the whole of our history and is still the
staple industry of the Commonwealth. But second to
wool, and advancing each year, comes the beef-cattle
industry.
It is for this reason that the present supplement—
first of its kind published by The Bulletin —has been
produced. It is hoped that this will be the start of a
series, presenting to readers at home and overseas a
comprehensive description of beef-cattle in Australia and
discussing all aspects of the industry.
The theme of this first issue is the present position
in the industry, as regards the export-market, transporta-
tion the vital link in the chain—and raising of the
many different breeds of beef-cattle that exist in Australia.
While discussing beef-cattle, it is also necessary to con-
sider the subsidiary industries—particularly hides and
by-products which form part of the full range of pro-
duction. A lot more might be written about altered
markets, for instance, owing to the changed constituents
of our population. But that, with the great controversy
of horn v. poll, must be left for discussion in future issues.


Review of the Year
By E. S. PLAYFAIR
a Vice-President of the R.A.S. of N.S.W.
'T'he past year in the beef
industry has been remark-
able. Prices of all types of
cattle for slaughter have
steadily increased to a record,
and numbers slaughtered
exceed those of any previous
year in my memory. The out-
standing feature has been the
steady rise in Queensland
values, which today
are 10s. to 20s. a
hundred above prices
ruling in N.S.W. This
must be a position
which has never
occurred before in the
last 50 years.
Thanks to breeders
and studmasters, beef-
cattle continue to
improve in quality,
and I feel they have
almost reached a
stage of breeding-
perfection. The polls,
too, are making a
great effort to sup-
plant horned cattle,
and I hope that de-
horning of stock will
continue ; it is a great
step forward in an
effort to avoid bruis-
ing, etc. I trust,
however, that the
short, low, thick type
will not be over-
pursued, and that
breeders will bear in
mind the demand for
a quality beef, nicely
covered over the
ribs and loins, but
not too square, with con-
sequent excessive waste. I hope
that the breeder will always
keep in mind exactly why he is
breeding: that is, to produce
a steer which will yield beef
demanded by popular choice,
both locally and overseas, and
forget the urge to breed stock
which are to catch the eye of a
showring judge.
Let us not be carried away
with the importance of baby-
beef and early maturity.
Experience has shown that
weight-for-age can be most
misleading and often produces
a surplus of waste fat and not
a good yield of meat. Also,
young beef is immature and
lacks the flavor of the older
steer. Some of the retail-trade
is keen, however, on this type
of beef, though, to my mind,
it resembles veal too closely.
The great interest and
improvement in the quality of
bullocks and steers in the past
eight or nine years has been
stimulated by competitions
staged by the various agricul-
tural societies. In N.S.W. the
R.A.S. realised the necessity of
STRATH PLAYFAIR
introducing competitions to
show breeders and fatteners
types required for the trade and
to foster the elimination of
old, heavy and overfat beasts,
with the result that in recent
Sydney Fat Cattle Shows,
which are held annually in
May, there’s usually a display
of well-bred steers (four-tooth
maximum) which does credit
to the exhibitors. The competi-
tions, both on hoof and as
carcass, have proved of great
educational value. Helpful
remarks and comments by
the judges of each individual
exhibit are of interest to those
of us anxious to learn.
Other States are following
this policy of weighing and
mouthing steers on the hoof,
and it now only remains for a
universal system of judging to
be arrived at; but, whether
judgment is by the eye of
experts or by some appraisal
system, the ultimate aim is the
same.
It is most gratifying that
these exhibitions ate receiving
„ .-. £
*!“ ‘ “ ssls,an “ £ro ™ ‘ he
C .b.1.K.0. thro ugh Dr.
Franklin, whose advice and
observations are both helpful
and instructive. It is appreci-
ated by the societies that the
export-classes are sponsored by
the Australian Meat Board. In
addition, in N.S.W. the Meat
Marketing Industry Board co-
operates closely with the
R.A.S. and, by their combined
efforts, the exhibition of
carcasses has become a yearly
feature at the inspection
ceremony held at the State
Abattoir.
The momentous question
seems to me to be: (1) When
is the U.S.A. demand for Aus-
tralian boneless beef likely to
cease? (2) Is it here to stay?
(3) How much has our cattle-
population been depleted in the
past 18 months? (4) Has the
demand for low-grade beef for
America been * a benefit in
cleaning-up the culls of our
females and helping us to be
rid of old and inferior bulls?
If the latter is true, it's a
blessing. But if we have cut
too deeply into our females,
maybe we will have to face the
same shortage as in the U.S.A.
Our statisticians’ figures might
help to clear this point.
It should be remembered that
the quantity of beef shipped to
U.S.A., although great, repre-
sents barely enough meat to
fill the requirements of one
meal for one person in one
year. But let us not forget the
tremendous gain in dollars by
this country during the past 18
months of meat-shipments.
Aberdeen-Angus Beef-cattle
in n.-e. and
central Scotland from a
group of closely related local
breeds, the Aberdeen-Angus
breed was founded by Hugh
Wa son, of Ke'Hor, A ngus and
William McCombie, of Tilly-
four Aberdeenshire.
These two men, with their
friends and neighbors, worked
out the foundation of the
modern breed in the first half
of the 19th century. The
existence of the original local
, , u- u j ii
breeds, which gradually
~ ® ,
coalesced into this breed, goes
, , . , .
back to a very remote past.
The breed took a prominent
, ~ j Ift ;, .
place in the mid-19th-century
agricultural exhibitions in Paris
and was successful in England
, T i . u * a •(„
and Ireland, but made its most
• r-
significant progress in the
U.S.A., Canada and the Argen-
j ne
„ . . , _ ~ c
In Britain the field of
development was geograph.-
cally limited, but in America,
where rivalry was just as keen,
there was more scope for
development of all breeds. Vast
grazing- and feeding-areas
called for a larger bovine popu-
lation, and not only- the wait-
ing farmlands but also the fact
that the American population
was becoming meat-minded
brought added stimulation to
animal-husbandry.
It was not until 1873 that
the Aberdeen-Angus breed was
added to the beef-cattle family
j n America, 90 years after the
Shorthorns and 56 years after
the Herefords. Yet by the
idd|e of the 20th cenlu the
roll of the American Aberdeen-
Angus Herdbook contained
mo re than two-million pure-
bred an j ma | s _ q U it e apart from

ANGUS
A SOUND INVESTMENT
INFLUENCING FACTS
• ANGUS are Supreme in World's Inter-Breed Fat Stock Competitions.
• ANGUS AND ANGUS CROSS-BREDS, during 1958, won more than 600 Championship
and Major Prizes, on the hoof and as carcases, in the principal All Breed Competitions
in Great Britain, Canada, America, The Argentine, New Zealand, and Australia.
• Why are ANGUS cows frequently called "Queen of brood cows"? Because, very, very seldom
do they miss producing a blocky black hornless calf each year. Actually, 100% calf crops
are not uncommon in ANGUS herds.
• ANGUS heifers, properly developed and bred as yearlings, produce strong, lusty calves as two-
year-olds.
• ANGUS calves are bigger at weaning. Why—because ANGUS mothers give a plentiful supply of
good, rich milk. ANGUS calves have the inherited ability and natural virility to grow fast.
• Longer cow life is a feature with ANGUS. It is not uncommon for an ANGUS cow to breed consistently
from a two-year-old to beyond 15 years.
• ANGUS are rapidly making their mark in the Continent, particularly Holland and Germany.

(Secretary, Harold N. Sarina) 56 YOUNG ST., SYDNEY
herd was, however, soon dis-
persed ; so true establishment
of the herd in Queensland was
by William Hogarth, who in
1882 bought some of the
four blood and established a
stud at Balgownie, Pittsworth.
In Victoria, J. G. Dougherty,
a Melbourne stock-and-station
agent, imported a few of the
breed in 1870 for resale. Of
these most were bought by
George Pretty (or Petty), of
Maribyrnong, Melbourne.
The breed was first brought
to N.S.W. by George Loder,
of Abbey Green, Singleton, a
noted Hereford breeder, who
also bought from Dougherty.
From the draft sent to Single-
ton, half went to George
Sparkes, of Rosebery, on the
Richmond River, and the rest
to Richard Dines, of Merriwa.
William Hogarth had mean-
while visited N.Z: and brought
back the famous bull Black
Lee (a champion bred by
McCombie) and a few cows.
On the death of George Dines,
Hogarth bought the purebred
females at Merriwa and also
got the pick of the Sparkes
herd.
South Australia and Western
Australia lagged behind the
other States in introducing
Aberdeen-Angus cattle. John
Lewis, of Adelaide, had a herd,
and probably a stud, before
1910, but no one knows when
or whence his cattle came.
A. L. Dunn, of Waratah, Ash-
bourne, owned the first
recorded stud of this breed in
the State. It was founded on
cattle he bought from P.
Sutherland, of Thologolong,
Wodonga (Vic.) in 1920.
Aberdeen-Angus were estab-
lished in Western Australia in
1891 by the father of John
Muir, of Beeside, Manjimup.
Adam Elder, of Teviotdale,
Moulyinning, brought cattle
from Scotland in 1911-12 and
formed a new stud in 1922. His
first registered sire was bred by
Sutherland and Sutherland, of
Victoria. From these begin-
nings, the “Doddies” have
spread right up the western
coast to Broome and on to the
Kimberleys.
The Aberdeen-Angus Society
of Australia was founded in
1919 with the aim of preserving
the pedigrees of purebred
cattle, maintaining the best
interests of the breed and
popularising it throughout the
Commonwealth.
The society was able to
collect the available data for a
herdbook, and, with the help
of R. S. Maynard (then
secretary of the Hereford
Society) Volume I was pub-
lished in Brisbane in 1922,
giving particulars of 62
numbered bulls and 313
numbered cows.
Among the studs registered
in the first volume was Eding-
lassie, founded by the White
Brothers, who bought the com-
plete Tucka Tucka stud, which
traced back to two bulls and
six cows imported in 1888 by
J. R. Smith. This stud was im-
proved by further importa-
tions, notably Quinton of
Haynes, Carolus Mulben and
Everall. Abington, another
registered stud, founded by
N. L. Forster, of Abington,
Armidale (N.S.W.), dated back
to 1918, when 10 heifers of
the Trojan Erica family—all
going back to Eclypta (imp.)—
were bought - from H. B.
Williams. To mate with these,
Drummadrochat was imported
from New Zealand and later
more heifers were bought from
H. B. Williams. The combina-
tion of this formation and
Banker of Castlecraig (imp.)
gave Abington its prominent
place in the showring.
The latest edition (Volume
XVIII) contains a membership
of 503 breeders and a registered
list of 856 bulls and 3510 cows.
The total number of registra-
tions since 1922 is over 24,000.
The. society has its own
distinctive brand, which must
be impressed on the nearside
cheek of the animal. Wrongful
use of this brand is an offence,
punishable under the Brands
Act, so it remains a hallmark
of breeding protected by law.
The latest annual report of
the Aberdeen-Angus Society
records an increased member-
ship-list and a sound financial
position.

Transport of Beef-cattle
By ALISON BINGLE (Vesteys')
Australia is at present
enjoying satisfactory
beef prices ; conse-
quently, it is commonly
thought that the cattleman is
having a good time because
seasonal conditions are satis-
factory over the greater part
of the continent.
Generally speaking there
exists a stimulant in prices
which encourages the cattle-
raiser to improve his product
and to market acceptable beef
whether for local consumption
or for export. It is necessary
to review the national problem
associated with transport, not
only because it retards the
progress of the beef industry
but also because it applies to
other primary industries,
Transport problems existing in
Australia today have a wide
effect on our economy.
The main marketing-centres
for the cattle which provide our
beef are on the seaboard, so
the movement of beef-cattle is
largely dependent on efficient
and economic rail-transport.
Railways
This is shown by the system
of our railways, laid many
years ago as a form of develop-
ment but now suffering from
the effect of age—many
branches to trunk-line routes
have been discarded. The
strain of heavy service and
overloading during War II and
labor trouble since have made
our rail-transport service, with
its present rolling-stock, out-
dated. Just what can be done
to bring the railways up to
standard and allow for expan-
sion and competition with other
beef-producing countries, like
the Argentine, is a question at
present beyond our State Gov-
ernments.
Rail-transport is being called
upon to handle greater
numbers, because the cattle-
population has increased by
millions since many of the first
ii nes were laid. Cattle have to
be moved to rail, ship or aero-
plane, so a general survey of
the development of transport is
necessary to determine whether
our standards in transport are
keeping step with production in
the beef industry, remembering
that there are huge areas suit-
able for cattle which are yet
only primitively developed,
j n these areas, where the
establishment of transport is
necessary to boost the potential
primary wealth, good ballasted
roads may be the answer,
Certainly good stock-routes are
necessary, with watering-
facilities conveniently spaced,
so that cattle can. be care-
fully droved, though this
form of movement is slow and
outdated. The experienced
drover is one of a dying race ;
but droving must still be relied
upon in our big outback cattle
areas, where many thousands
of cattle each year are moved
by droving—mostly in store-
condition going from breeding-
areas to fattening-country,
from which later, as fats, they
are railed to meatworks or
other marketing-centres.
In many parts of Queensland
big numbers of fat-cattle can
only be moved from their
pastures by this method. They
walk in mobs up to 500 in
number, covering distances up
to 300 miles. In many cases
they then have long rail-
journeys to reach the distant
mar k et
*
Droving
T s , .
It may be oppoitune
record some of the long-
distance droving feats which
were successfu ly undertaken
by pioneers of the last century
—men hke th ® Duracks,
Buchanan, the MacDonalds
and arOU u- d
the 1880 s, drove big
herds of mixed-sex cattle from
N.S.W. to north-west Aus-
tralia, as many as 2000-head in
one mob, taking two years to
complete the trip under
hazardous conditions. Even in
recent years, highly experienced
old-time drovers have trekked
mobs from the East Kim'oerleys
in north-west Australia to
Central Queensland ; one
careful drover moved a mob of
1000 fat speyed cows and
made a delivery of 97 per cent,
to the meatworks —a wonderful
feat, but who could estimate
the wastage in weight and
quality on such a long
journey?
The Wyndham meatworks,
situated on the Cambridge
Gulf, in the nor’-west of W.A-,
handles about 35,000 fat-cattle
each year. Mostly the beef
goes to export, in spite of the
fact that all fat-cattle supplying
the works are driven over
hazardous, rough stock-routes,
very primitively improved, over
distances up to 400 miles. This
method with its existing condi-
tions has been going on since
these meatworks were estab-
lished about 1916.

feats of droving must show
anyone interested in improving
the quality of our beef that
only animals with strong con-
stitutions, and never of the soft,
early-maturing type, can stand-
up to long, rough droving-trips
—the more desirable early-
maturing types, comparable to
those of the Argentine, cannot
be produced or encouraged
whilst these transport condi-
tions prevail in our outback.
Remote, long stock-routes,
which will be forever remem-
bered in the development of the
cattle industry in Australia,
have such names as the Can-
ning Route, Western Australia
(lonely from beginning to end,
leading from the East Kim-
berleys through desert, sand-
hill country for 700 miles to
Meekatharra); the Birdsville
Track, West Queensland, lead-
ing to Marree (S.A.), serviced
often by camel-train carrying
water and feed to allow mobs
of cattle to negotiate dry
stages ; the Murranji Route, in
the N.T., through from New-
castle Waters to Victoria River
Downs and Wave Hill—2oo
miles of desert with hazards
of thick lancewood timber and
bullwaddi scrub, which are
always a nightmare to drovers.
These routes have taken their
toll over the years they have
been in use. The Birdsville and
Murranji still see much traffic ;
but the Canning Route, with
perhaps one small mob
annually, is of little use, except
that its sand-wells provide
water for walkabout desert
aboriginals. Yet, years ago, it
was important as the one exit
A road-train (N.T.)
for Kimberley cattle to the
southern markets in Western
Australia.
Some authorities may say
that; these isolated areas, where
on jy stock - routes exist,
maintain but a small percentage
0 f Australia’s cattle-popula-
tion ; but hungry nations think
that this great area is the
potential beef-producing part
of Australia. It is within the
more closely settled parts of
Queensland, where the cattle-
population is rising, that
transport-facilities are improv-
ing, as well as in the southern
States. It seems 6 necessary to
review the evolution of trans-
port within the industry,
because the road-system in
these more southern areas has
been greatly improved in recent
years since modern transport
has come into operation.
F
Road-transport
Today, many thousands of
cattle are moved by road-
transport, which is fast and
generally efficient. It is in the
hands of private owners, and
although Governments have
tried to restrict its operation in
opposition to the railways, it
continues to expand economic-
ally both for the cattleman and
' the operator. This form of
transport can act as a feeder
to the Government-owned rail-
ways, provided the latter can
handle the volume of freight.
Therefore, more feeder-roads
are necessary in all parts of the
continent, and the railways
would get more revenue if they
would co-ordinate themselves
with other forms of transport.
Also, it is necessary to stress
the importance of co-ordinated
feeder services in times of
drought, if our cattle-popula-
tion is to be preserved.
In the outback, where roads
are constructed to allow road-
trains to operate, full advant-
age of this type of transport
should be taken. Many
properties in the Northern
Territory are using road-trains,
particularly where they can
operate on the Stuart and Isa
highways. Bigger trains com-
prise two trailers behind a
prime-mover and carry about
80 bullocks or up to 106
females ; smaller ones, with one
trailer, carry between 36 and
40 bullocks. The economic use

HEREFORD CATTLE
By DAVID A. PRATTEN
(A Councillor of the R.A.S. of N.S.W.)
nPHE reason for the popu-
larity of Hereford cattle
and the particular characteris-
tic which must be retained, if
the breed is to maintain this
position, may be summed-up
in the word “constitution.”
Hereford cows rear their
calves well and maintain their
own condition at the same
time, having exceptionally
long lives as breeders. Pre-
potency is a marked charac-
teristic of the Hereford males.
Herefords are unsurpassed
as graziers and fatten readily
on grass alone, so they have
always been in great demand
in the main grazing districts.
Animals upon which the breed
was founded were selected
because they showed this
characteristic, which has been
developed by breeders, so that
it is transmitted from genera-
tion to generation. Through
its adaptability to varying
conditions, quiet tempera-
ment and ability to recover
quickly after a setback and,
above all, because of its ability
to produce the highest-quality
carcass in the most economical
manner, the breed has become
one of the most popular in the
world.
The development of Here-
ford cattle in Australia is
mainly due to the enthusiasm
of the original stud-breeders
and those who founded the
Australian Hereford Society.
Had it not been for the keen-
ness of the late A. J.
McConnel, of Brisbane, most
of the old records and pedi-
grees would have been lost. In
1885 he, with Frank Reynolds,
of Tocal, and Reginald Wynd-
ham, of Leconfield, called a
meeting of Hereford breeders
in Sydney, with the aim of
forming an association for
recording the breeding of
Hereford stud - cattle. The
Australian Herd Book Society
was formed and about 30
breeders joined, A. J. McCon-
nel, Nugent Brown, Frank
Reynolds and Reginald Wynd-
ham being elected as editing
committee. The book was
eventually published in 1890,
but had it not been for the
enthusiasm of A. J. McConnel,
who practically alone carried
the burden of publishing in all
six volumes, most of the
records would have been lost.
As it was, he carried on until
the present Australian Here-
ford Society was founded in
1917.
In 1937 there were only 120
members of the Australian
Hereford Society, recording
2609 calves and registering 208
bulls and 665 females, but
today the society has a total
membership of 678.
It will be seen that from a
humble beginning the estab-
lishment and development of
stud-Hereford cattle constitute
a notable achievement in the
annals of livestock in Aus-
tralia. From the big raw-
boned animal with wide pro-
truding hips has evolved the
modern shapely beast, which
is now predominant in most
districts.
I visited most of the lead-
ing studs in England in 1955
and 1957, and also inspected
a number of studs, feed-lots,
etc., in the United States. In
my opinion, our cattle com-
pare most favorably with
those in other countries,
though Great Britain still
seems able to produce those
few really good top sires that
have had great influence on
the breed. Fortunately, before
the import-ban a. number of
stud-breeders imported some
very good sires. As a stud-
breeder I feel we are not yet
in the position to maintain,
let alone improve, our present
standards without the top
stud-breeders returning to the
Old Country for new sires
from time to time.
The county of Hereford-
shire, England, has long been
famed for its beef-cattle, and
among the better-known of its
early breeders are the Tomkins
family.
First there was Richard
Tomkins, who died in 1723,
leaving his cattle to his sons,
of whom there were six. His
particular interest in his cattle
and their value are indicated
by the fact that they were
referred to individually by
name in his will ; his fourth
son, Benjamin, then only nine
years old, received the cow
Silver and her calf, now con-
sidered to be a foundation of
the Hereford breed.
Benjamin Tomkins, the
elder, was the first great
improver of the breed, con-
tinuing his work until his
death in 1789. He had four
sons, one of whom, also named
Benjamin, continued his
father’s good work.
Other members of this
family were keen breeders of
cattle so that the influence of
the family in general on the
early growth of the breed was
profound.
It has been suggested that
the Hereford obtained its
white face as a result of cross-
breeding the then native cattle
of Herefordshire with
Flanders cattle introduced into
the country by Lord Scuda-
more, who died in 1671, but
it is also probable that this
white face came from the
Welsh white cattle which were
once common in Hereford-
shire. At any rate, the present-
day Hereford is a descendant
of a widely diffused and
ancient race.
Touring the nineteenth
century the Hereford breed
gradually made its name
throughout Great Britain, but
it was not until 1846 that the
first volume of the herd-book
was produced by T. C. Eyton
and public recording of pedi-
grees within the breed was;
initiated. Thirty-two years
later, in 1878, the Hereford
Herd Book Society was
founded and took-over full
control of the publication of
the herd-book. In 1884 the
herd-book was “close d”
against all cattle whose sires
and dams had not been regis-
tered. Since that time the
British society has grown
steadily and Herefords have
been exported to most of the
countries of the \yorld.
The first reference made to
the importation of Hereford
cattle into Australia appears
in the files of the Historical
Records of Australia, Series
111, Vol. 6, page 125-
Captain B. B. Thomas, writing
to Colonial Secretary Burnett
from the Cressy Company,
Cressy, England, refers to the
importation of “Improved
Shorthorn and Hereford Cows
and Bulls,” and this stock
evidently arrived at Hobart in
the Albion on May 4, 1826,
according to reports in the
“Hobart Town Gazette”
(16/5/1826) and the “Colonial
Times” (12/5/1826).
Included in this first ship-
ment were the Hereford bull,
Billy, and cows, Matchless and
Beauty. In later years the
Cressy Company made many
importations, but perhaps the
most outstanding and interest-
ing to present-day breeders
was the bull Constadt,
imported in 1854, and appear-
ing in many of our present-
day pedigrees.
The first Herefords to land
on the mainland of Australia
were imported from England
by George Wyndham, then of
Dalwood, on the Hunter
River, and landed in Sydney
during December, 1827.
Further importations for the
Dalwood herd were made in
1840. The Dalwood Stud was
later carried on by Reginald
Wyndham, of Leconfield, also
on the Hunter River, and
direct descendants of these
cattle are carefully bred today
by P. A. Wright and Sons,
of Wallamumbi, Armidale
(N.S.W.).
The future of the Hereford
cattle has never been brighter.
It has been stated on reliable
authority that unless cattle-
breeders are able to increase
their herds considerably to
keep pace with the increase
of the population of Australia,
within the next 10 years or
so it will be difficult to pro-
duce sufficient beef to feed
our own population, let alone
export any ; and the position
could be further aggravated if
a number of our commercial
cattlemen allow their females
to be sold as meat for the
overseas market.
More and more commercial
breeders are realising that it
pays handsomely to use good
bulls in their herds; that it
is cheaper to feed a good
animal than a poor one and
that it is the best return in
the shortest possible time that
really counts.

POLL SHORTHORNS
From "DENIM"
I wonder how many Aus-
tralians of the present
generation recognise the
important part cattle, and
Shorthorn cattle in particular,
have played in pioneering and
developing this great con-
tinent?
The pioneers of the late
18th century and early 19th
century brought with them a
few head of cattle and the
number was added to from
time to time by further
importations. These cattle
formed the foundation of-
herds which quickly multi-
plied. The pioneers crossed
the mountains and moved
westwards, taking their cattle
with them, and on the western
slopes and plains the herds
flourished and increased.
Pioneers and their cattle
fanned outward to the south,
west and north.
From Bathurst they went
north to Cape York and west-
ward, inland across Queens-
land and the Northern Terri-
tory, into the Kimberleys and
the Western Australian coast,
opening-up the country from
the Pacific to the Indian
Ocean.
By the end of the 19th
century cattle had opened-up
practically all suitable country
in the Commonwealth and had
been followed over a great
part of it by sheep and agri-
culture.
Cattle provided the staple
foods of milk, butter, cheese
and meat and also provided
the power which enabled the
pioneers to develop the country.
Bullock - teams pulled the
wagons (or drays, as they
were in the early days) on
which was carried the plant,
furniture, machinery, tools and
rations required to establish
the homesteads. They pro-
vided power to draw machin-
ery to move timber, rocks, soil,
etc., to enable the establish-
ment of wharves for coastal
shipping and foundations for
town buildings, for clearing
timber and laying foundations
for early railways and bridges
and for drawing logs to mills
for sawing into building-
timber.
They pulled the ploughs
and scoops to sink tanks and
build dams for water-storage
and, in fact, provided all the
power required to erect every
improvement the pioneers
needed to establish them-
selves. Cattle were in the van-
guard of all early settlement
in Australia and those used
in all this work were chiefly
the hardy Shorthorns.
As time passed other breeds
were imported, and today all
British breeds are well estab-
lished. The cattleman’s motto
is “Cattle for Country,” and
the various breeds have been
established in the country to
which they are best suited.
By the beginning of the
present century the Shorthorn
was well established as one of
the foremost breeds over most
of the continent. The pioneers,
being men of vision, continued
to improve the quality and
standard of their herds. They
imported from the U.K. the
best blood available and by
careful selection of females
and wise mating built-up the
magnificent Shorthorn studs
of which Australia is today
justly proud. Breeders of
herd-bulls in the inland
secured their top sires from
these studs and, in turn, sup-
plied herd-bulls to the vast
breeding-herds. As herds
increased and the- question
of marketing arose so the
problem of movement and
transport came in. Rail-
ways had moved inland and
provided the main means of
moving large mobs of store-
cattle to inland fattening-areas
and fat cattle to the coastal
meatworks and city abattoirs.
As cattle were herded in
large mobs and at water-
troughs, in yards and rail-
way-trucks on the long hauls
to the coast, it became
obvious to all concerned
that the horns of the
animal were a decided dis-
advantage because they caused
damage to hides and bruised
the meat.
This became so serious, and
the financial loss was so great,
that cattlemen were forced to
look for methods of preven-
tion or cure.
Tipping the horn was found
to be useful; then dehorning
was tried, and after a few
years became almost universal
in many large herds, but de-
horning was at best a cruel,
expensive and sometimes fatal,
method of treatment, and men
of vision decided that the only
thing to do was to breed the
horn off.
At this time Poll Shorthorns
were well established in a
small way in the U.S.A., and
it is interesting to note that
the original breed there
stemmed from three “mutants”
or “sports,” which had been
born hornless in two pure
Shorthorn herds.
The Australian history
shows that as far back as 1874
D. S. McLarty bred a Poll
Shorthorn heifer from pure
horned parents and this heifer
produced a number of poll-
progeny and continued breed-
ing from these which even-
tually produced cattle that
became the foundation of the
Lone Pine Stud. The late C. A.


GUNNAWARRA Poll Shorthorn Stud
THE GUNNAWARRA STORY
In 1895 a Shorthorn stud was started at
Clifton, Hamilton (Vic.), by A. J. Simpson,
the original cattle coming from Mt. Noorat
Stud, Terang (Vic.). Gunnawarra Stud was
formed in 1926 with Clifton Stud-Shorthorns.
In 1933, a Poll Shorthorn bull, Browndale
Sultan—with good head and bone, well-fleshed
and docile —was imported from America;
this bull bred exceptionally well on horned
females. Later Oakwood Maud (P) was
imported from the American Oakwood Stud.
Since then many outstanding Poll Shorthorn
sires have been used, including Oakwood
Consul, which was at Gillendoon, Warren,
for a period, and Miltons Headstrong 2nd.
More recently, the sires used have been
Hilldale A. Collynie 2nd (P) (imported from
the U.S. in 1950), Lynwood Commander (P)
(bred in the Lynwood stud), Gunnawarra
Gay Lad 3rd (P) and Gunnawarra Radiant
(P). Still at Gunnawarra is Gunnawarra
Radiant 64th (P), aged 14 years, the sire of
J. T. Scrymgeour’s all-time record Poll
Shorthorn bull, which sold for 5300gns.
Present sires at Gunnawarra are: Gundibri
Champagne 56th (P), a big, placid dark-
roan, with great hindquarter and bone and a
breeder’s head; Russley Floe (P), (by Gunna-
warra Norseman (P), which was sold to
T. H. Fleming, of Aberdeen, in 1950 and sired
their grand-champion bull at this year’s
Brisbane Royal); and Gunnawarra Kenneth
Gay Symbol—a Typical Gunnawarra Heifer
Country Life Photo
(P), by Glastullick Kenneth (Imp.), which
has bred so well at Weenya Stud.
The stud at present comprises 150 breeders,
including heifers, and the young stock are
promising, especially calves by Gundibri
Champagne 56th. A limited number of herd-
bulls are bred by top-sires.

Munro had a similar experi-
ence which led to the estab-
lishment of the Arcot Stud.
In the early 1920’s E. E. D.
White, of Toomba station,
Charters Towers (Q.), one of
Australia’s great cattlemen,
imported two Polled Short-
horn bulls from America.
Other well-known breeders
followed White’s example, and
the breed quickly became
firmly established.
Scientists and geneticists
had by this time established
the fact that the poll-gene was
dominant and this greatly
encouraged these pioneers in
their work.
It was not until 1935 that
any constructive work was
done in Australia in establish-
ing and preserving the pedi-
gree and breeding-records of
what was to be a constant
stream of Poll Shorthorn
importations from overseas.
In that year R. C. Botterell,
A. Hordern, snr., W. A. Lang,
D. G. Munro, A. R. Munro
and F. S. Simpson arranged a
meeting at the Royal Easter
Show in Sydney and there
formed and constituted the
Poll Shorthorn Society of
Australasia, which has now
grown to an organisation of
over 400 members.
Following this inaugural
meeting, interest in this newly
established breed became
widespread.
The first stud-book, pub-
lished in 1937, was followed
by another in 1939, and by
this time its members included
the names of such outstanding
breeders as D. H. Robertson,
E. L. Killen, Mrs. E. I. Killen,
K. G. McKinnon, Livingston
Brothers, Wilson and
McDonall, W. A. Lang, Cor-
reena Pastoral Company,

Killen Pty., Ltd., W. R. Tin-
dale, J. T. Scrymgeour, Lionel
Whitelaw, New Zealand and
Australian Land Co., and
many others who have since
made their name as stud-
breeders.
The number of Poll Short-
horn breeders increased so
quickly that it was apparent
that this was a decided chal-
lenge to cattlemen to study an
additional factor in breeding
Shorthorns. They were of the
opinion that the horn should
be got rid of. That this horn-
damage was no idle fancy is
shown from the following
notes taken from A Stock
Owners Guide published in
Queensland in the middle
1930’s by an international
meat-company, when beef was
selling at about 28s. for 1001 b.
on the hoof; “The loss by
bruising of fatstock in Queens-
land is estimated at £250,000
a year. Dehorning of cattle
is the first step to minimise
bruising. Tipping the horns
of grown cattle is a big help.
Dehorned or poll-cattle are
worth at least 3s. for 1001 b.
more than horned cattle if
bought on the hoof to be
trucked any distance. Leather
showing the effects of horn-
marks has to be sold in
second- and third - quality
grades according to the
amount of damage. Dehorned
or poll-cattle are quieter and
easier to work and will always
truck at least--one more beast
to the truck.’
Today high-quality Poll
Shorthorn studs are estab-
lished in every State of the
Commonwealth, including the
Northern Territory and the
Kimberleys, and are providing
the top bulls for herd-bull
breeders and thus meeting the
needs of the commercial
breeder.
Poll Shorthorns, although
only registered as a distinct
breed 24 years ago, now take
their place in all State Royal
Shows and for numbers,
quality and high standard,
hold their own with all British
breeds. In the sale-ring they
more than hold their own for
highest price and sale-averages,
They have even penetrated to
and are making their presence
felt among the stud-cattle
breeders of the U.K.
Such famous studs as
Bapton, in Kent (Eng.), and
Westdrums, in Angus (Scot-
land), presided over by out-
standing Shorthorn breeders
iik e Gordon Blackstock and
Gerry Rankin, have now
established Poll Shorthorn
studs by importing high-
quality bulls and females from
U.S.A. and Canada,
William Robertson, of the
Scotston Stud (Scotland), who
has b een breeding Poll Short-
horns for some years, made
history by importing a top
p O H Shorthorn bull from one
of Australia’s leading studs.
T hj s bull was reserve-cham-
pion at the Sydney Royal in
1958.

POLLS
The Santa Gertrudis Story
By SAMUEL HORDERN
President of the Santa Gertrudis Breeders’ (Australia) Association.
Santa Gertrudis —the first
new breed of cattle to be
developed anywhere in the
world in more than 100 years —
evolved from a Brahman-
Shorthorn cross. They were
the first American breed of
beef-cattle, and were officially
recognised as a pure breed in
1940.
The first Santa Gertrudis
were introduced into Australia
less than eight years ago and
have since had spectacular
success. As an example of
this,. King Ranch (Australia)
Pty., Ltd., the original importer
of these cattle, has sold 87 bulls
since 1952 for a total of more
than £130,000.
Twelve young bulls averaged
2470gns. at the 1958 sale, an
Australasian record for any
breed sold at public auction.
There are now more than 60
breeders in all parts of the
Commonwealth, the islands of
New Guinea and New Britain.
The Santa Gertrudis
Breeders’ (Australia) Associa-
tion, of which I have the honor
to be president, has a member-
ship of 46 in New South Wales,
Queensland and Victoria.
From the moment they arrived
in Australia, Santa Gertrudis
showed a liking for the country
and did well in all varieties of
climate and conditions.
Incidentally, Australia was
the first country in the world
to receive a pure-bred herd of
Santa Gertrudis females from
the United States.
The cattle have done parti-
cularly well in Queensland and
the Gulf country because they
do not run a sun-temperature
and show strong resistance to
ticks. One theory about this
unusual resistance is that Santa
Gertrudis sweat like humans
and repel ticks and other
parasites by exuding a sticky
substance from their skins.
The cattle have also become
very popular in the Northern
Territory and the Kimberley
areas of Western Australia.
I am often asked about the
origin of the name Santa
Gertrudis. To answer that
question one must go back to
the foundation of the breed.
The name is derived from a
land-grant originally conferred
by the Crown of Spain in the
early days of Texas and now
part of the famous King
Ranch. It was on King Ranch
that the Santa Gertrudis breed
was established by the Kleberg
family.
King Ranch was founded by
Captain Richard King in 1853
and the original cattle were
Mexican Longhorns—a hardy
breed well suited to the semi-
tropical climate of that part
of South Texas, but not high-
quality beef.
From the beginning Captain
King realised that the goal of
King Ranch should be to
produce a breed of cattle com-
bining hardiness with fine-
quality beef. The first serious
crossbreeding experiments were
undertaken in 1880 when: British
Herefords and Shorthorns were
introduced. These experiments
continued for 25 years with
some measure of success, but it
was realised that more hardi-
ness was needed to contend
with the hot conditions and
sometimes scanty grazing.
The answer came by observ-
ing the progress of the sturdy
Brahman breed of cattle, which
thrived under the most trying
conditions in Texas.
In 1910, Robert J. Kleberg,
senior, son-in-law of Captain
King and manager of King
Ranch, first infused Brahman
blood with his Shorthorns.
The results were so encourag-
ing that Kleberg extended the
experiment to an entire herd
of more than 2500 purebred
Shorthorn cows.
One Shorthorn herd,
containing predominantly
Lavender ViscounC breeding,
became the maternal founda-
tion of the Santa Gertrudis
breed. This second phase pro-
duced. the foundation-sire of
the breed. This was an out-
standing bull-calf of distinctive
red color, born in 1920 and of
such a mischievous nature that
he was named Monkey by the
King Ranch hands.
Exceptionally heavy for a
calf and weighing 11001 b. at
12 months of age, Monkey
sired his first calves as a -three-
year-old and, before he died
in 1932, had produced 150 sons.
Some of his sons, grandsons
and later descendants became
notable sires.
The development of Santa
Gertrudis cattle, begun by
Robert J. Kleberg, was con-
tinued by his son, Robert J.
Kleberg, junior, who is now
president and manager of King
Ranch. The Klebergs used
selective line-breeding, occa-
sional inbreeding and skilful
mass-selection to establish the
original characteristics of
Monkey in the Santa Gertrudis
breed.
The Santa Gertrudis of
today is a cherry-red color, has
a good disposition and is excep-
tionally large, hardy and beefy.
The cattle are deep-fleshed and
especially heavy in the hind-
quarters. They have charac-
teristic heads, a pronounced
navel lap and a large dewlap.
All the bulls have a slight crest
on the neck.
Santa Gertrudis have proved
their ability to thrive under a
wide variety of grazing and
climatic conditions. They are
now to be found in 27 States
of the United States and 30
countries in South America,
Europe, Africa, Asia and Aus-
tralasia, where the weather
ranges from very hot to very
cold.
The ability of these cattle to
thrive under such extremes of
temperature was one of the
prime reasons that encouraged
Australian breeders to intro-
duce them to this country. The
first shipment of 200 pure-bred
Santa Gertrudis heifers and 50
bulls arrived here in February,
1952, and were located at
Risdon Stud, near Warwick
(Q.). This was the biggest
single shipment of cattle ever
imported to Australia without
the loss of one beast in transit.
Cattlemen throughout Aus-
tralia, particularly in Queens-
land, were eager to purchase
bulls of this new breed of
cattle. The first draft of 12
Risdon bulls offered for sale
in November, 1952, attracted
an attendance of more than
2000 buyers and visitors. The
bulls averaged 1108gns. and
went to all parts of Australia.
Since then the breed has
adapted itself remarkably to
Australian conditions.
The propensity of Santa
Gertrudis to fatten and their
early maturity make them
economical and profitable for
beef-production, under both
good and hard station condi-
tions.
The breed made its debut at
the Sydney Fat Stock and
Carcass Show in 1957 w'ith con-
spicuous success. Santa
Gertrudis - cross Shorthorn
steers won the coveted
champion pen-of-three class,
averaging 60.91 per cent, of
their live-weight. The judge,
C. C. Nichols, commented
“These carcasses had the beef
where it was most wanted, on
the loin and the hindquarters.”
Robert J. Kleberg, junior,
who helped to evolve the breed,
has taken a keen personal
interest in the establishment of
Santa Gertrudis in Australia.
He has paid several visits here
and judged the Santa Gertrudis
classes at the 1956 Sydney
Royal Easter Show.
Incidentally, Kleberg pur-
chased several first-class Aus-
tralian-bred racehorses during
his visits here and raced them
in his colors.
The popularity of Santa
Gertrudis is increasing every
year as the breed becomes,
established in many different
areas. There is a growing
demand for first- and second-
cross Santa Gertrudis steers.
Australian - bred Santa
Gertrudis have been exported
to Fiji, New Caledonia, New

FOR MEAT, MILK &
RED POLLS
By BRIGADIER G. S. HURST
Origin
TTS7ell over 100 years ago, the
principal need of live-
stock-farmers in the eastern
counties of England—Essex,
Suffolk and Norfolk —was for
a breed of cattle which would
thrive on the by-products of
their primarily arable land.
They wanted thrifty animals
that would do well with a
minimum of concentrates, and
cows that, while giving
economical quantities of good-
quality milk, would produce a
bull-calf which would grow
into excellent beef. To achieve
this aim, they crossed the high-
yielding Suffolk Dun with the
Norfolk beef - animal and
evolved the Red Poll breed.
In 1888 one of the first names
in the Herd Book was that of
John Hammond, who owned
one of the best groups in the
breed. He was the grandfather
of Dr. John Hammond, the
geneticist and world-famous
authority on cattle and beef,
who visited Australia recently
at the request of the Meat
Board.
East Anglia has the hottest
and driest summer-climate in
the whole of England ; in the
winter, these parts are open to
the full force of the North Sea
gales and notorious for their
bitter cold. In such hard con-
ditions, a really hardy breed
has been built-up, capable of
doing well anywhere in the
world, whatever the climate.
Dual-purpose
The principle of dual-
purpose breeding has many
opponents; yet, in practice,
most of us are continually try-
ing for it. What man-on-the-
land does not find his utility—
half-car and half-loadcarrier—
one of the most useful
machines on his place? What
Merino-breeder does not find
his surplus sheep useful for
rations? As far as Red Polls
are concerned, the term “dual-
purpose” merely implies that
they breed beefy calves and
have sufficient milk to rear their
offspring and to finish them
in full bloom.
Many of the cows give
sufficient milk to be used as
milkers, and there are many
breeders who select the highest
producers and build-up their
herds primarily for dairying
purposes. But excessive pro-
duction of either beef or milk
is not aimed at in the breed’s
standard description. The
emphasis is to obtain as much
of both as possible and to
exaggerate neither.
Red Polls Supreme
Red Poll breeders have for
many years claimed theirs as
Red Polls at Larkhill, Goulburn (N.S.W.).
the supreme dual - purpose
breed. This claim was upheld
at this year’s English Royal
Show. Whilst the Beef-
Shorthorn team was winning
the Burke Trophy as supreme
beef-breed, the Red Poll team
won the Burke Trophy against
14 others in the dairy and dual-
purpose sections of this com-
petition.
Importance of Milk in
Beef-production
In every breed of cattle there
are individual cows and
families, which combine a
wealth of fleshing with an
excellent milk-yield. However
this is by no means a universal
characteristic in the pure-beef
breeds. In Red Polls these
two qualities are the hallmark
of the breed.
If milk was not such a vital
factor in beef-production, one
would not find so many beef-
studs using foster-mothers.
The labor, expense and risk of
disease caused by foster-
mothering does not worry a
Red Poll breeder. His cattle
are kept closer to nature’s
standards; without being
driven to extremes, they
remain correctly balanced and
thereby avoid the difficulties
that have arisen in other breeds
by trying for excess in any one
direction. Red Polls have never
shown dwarfism and have
retained their fertility, hardy
constitution and ability to gain
weight. It is, therefore, not
surprising to find that the
average Red Poll cow weans a
calf weighing up to 7501 b. at
10 months.
Unbiased Opinion*
Alan Fraser, in his Farming
for Beef, writes: “As regards
beef-production, the Red Poll
is little behind the pure beef-
breeds and, in certain aspects,
is ahead of them. Originated
from Red Poll cattle, the
breed’s capacity for rapid
growth, say, up to 15 months
of age, is greater than any other
breed.”
In the U.S.A., at Indiana
State Fair and the district-
shows of that State, there is a
weight-gain competition open
to all registered yearlings and
calves of any breed entered in
the shows. A daily gain of
21b. for bulls and steers and
lylb. for heifers is the qualify-
ing standard. In 1956, Red
Polls qualified a higher per-
centage (72} per cent.) than
any other breed (Shorthorns,
33} per cent.; Herefords, 18}
per cent.; Angus, 16} per cent.)
The young Red Poll steer class
at England’s Fat Stock Show
at Smithfield and Red Polls’
general successes in the 1957
International Carcass Contest
at Chicago fully support these
results.
Performance On the Hoof
Frequently Red Polls do not
impress beef-judges on the
hoof. Before his last visit to
Australia, Dr. John Hammond
was asked for advice on the
best method of bringing Red
Poll beef to the notice of
breeders and butchers. His
reply was: “The best chance
of Red Poll beef is in carcass-
competitions. The Red Poll
stands a far better chance in
these than in live-beef com-
petitions.” This opinion is
borne-out by a Red Poll steer
which gained premier-carcass
award at a recent Melbourne
Royal Show, when competing
against Shorthorn, Angus and
Santa Gertrudis-cross steers —
and yet was unplaced on the
hoof!
At Chicago in 1957, W. H.
Severin said: “Red Polls
possess unique beef-producing
qualities not generally well-
known to the public. There are
markets where Red Polls will
bring a premium when sold for
beef, simply because buyers
there have learned that the
carcasses please both con-
sumers and butchers.”
Conclusion
Apart from the other advan-
tages of the breed —and its
success has been witnessed at
shows and sales throughout the
Commonwealth — there’s no
form of production more suit-
able to Red Poll cows than as
quick-grown vealers, nourished
on the dam and finished with
size and bloom ahead of most

LAGE YOUR STUD OR COMMERCIAL REQUIREMENTS
SHORTHORNS
By ANTHONY HORDERN, Jnr.
Chairman of the Cattle Section Committee, R.A.S. of N.S.W.
Ohorthorns, first breed of
improved cattle to emerge,
have clearly shown the potency
of their blood under the most
varied conditions of climate
and location. In varying pro-
portions and by devious means,
they have influenced the
advancement of all breeds and
types of improved cattle.
They were the first breed
imported to America to im-
prove the Longhorns of the
Western Ranges and provide
the foundation of the present
American cattle industry.
They were the first arrivals in
the Argentine, possibly first in
Australia, too, and certainly
first in New Zealand. In
South Africa recognition of
the inherent merit of Short-
horns is overwhelming.
The Shorthorn Herd Book
was compiled by George
Coates in 1822, but some
short-horned cattle noted in
the book can be traced with
certainty further back.
It has been suggested that
Shorthorns trace their origin
to the wild white cattle kept
by the earls and dukes of
Northumberland in the 15th
century and to herds belong-
ing to the Smithsons, of Stan-
wick, in the 17th century. How-
ever, it is certain that there
existed, in the Tees Valley
around Darlington (Eng.), a
race of cattle known as Tees-
waters, whose principal charac-
teristics were large frames,
good bone, capacity to attain
great weight and a heavy milk-
yield.
The written history of the
Shorthorn can be divided into
three eras: that of the Collings
Brothers; that of the Bates
and Booth families ; and that
of the Scottish improvers,
dominated by Amos Cruick-
shank, the herdsman of Aber-
deenshire.
The Collings Brothers,
Charles and Robert, are
rightly regarded as pioneers
of Shorthorn - breeding.
Acquainted with the methods
successfully followed by Bake-
well, of Dishley, in the develop-
ment of Longhorn cattle and
Leicester sheep, they founded
their programme on the best
available cows, and Robert
showed great discernment by
purchasing the bull, Hubbacic
319, for 10 guineas. Hubback
may be said to be the first
übiquitous proven sire, for he
was bought solely on account
of the quality of his calves
from all manner of cows,
which he had been serving at
a shilling a time.
Thus the Collings Brothers
began with the best speci-
mens from various sources,
and, applying Bakewell’s prin-
ciples, achieved the production
of an animal with sound con-
stitution and with a frame
fitted to carry profitable flesh,
of modern size, shapely and
early maturity, with well-
sprung ribs and short legs,
good milking-qualities and
good hide. It can be seen,
then, that the original im-
proved Shorthorn was a dual-
purpose animal, bred for meat
and milk.
Nowadays, although all
strains trace back to common
ancestors, it is proper to
recognise that with more than
a century of specialised breed-
ing for beef or milk two dis-
tinct types have been pro-
duced which need separate
treatment in the list of breeds.
At the dispersal of the
Collings herds in 1810 and
1818, Thomas Bates, -of Kirk-
levington, and John Booth, of
Warlaby and Kitterby, were
both prominent buyers, and
so we reach the second era.
Bates and Booth were more
than contemporaries; they
were in constant rivalry, and
each, in his own way, left an
impression on the breed. Bates
was an apostle of close in-
breeding, while Booth selected
the best types of cattle and
mated them with the best bulls
bred by the Collings.
The Bates cattle eventually
spread south into the growing
industrial areas, while the
Booth cattle spread into Scot-
land to develop in the rich
farmlands of the east.
It is now that Amos Cruick-
shank, of Sittyton, evolved a
distinctive type which was to
affect the future stockbreeding
of the world. Another person
who at that time became
interested in Shorthorns was
Campbell, of Kinellar, whose
family still breed Shorthorns
there today.
Amos Cruickshank thought
that individual merit was the
first essential and his aim was
to fix and breed a type of
easy - feeding, short - legged,
thick-fleshed and compactly
made butcher’s beast, a type
that would suit the circum-
stances of the north and “pay
the rent.” He travelled far
and wide in search of good
cattle. As a result his herd
became a collection of miscel-
laneous breeding, but consisted
of the most vigorous consti-
tutioned cattle to be found
anywhere. And then came the
interesting point; after 30
years of getting the best by
extreme outcrossing, he gave-
up the introduction of fresh
blood from other sources and
began to use almost exclusively
home-bred bulls, although he
never risked the dangers of too-
close inbreeding.
It was lucky for the Short-
horn breed that what Amos
Cruickshank started, William
Duthie, of Collynie with
unerring instinct for the Cruick-
shank ideal —carried on. An
observer of the time wrote:
“Amos Cruickshank built the
edifice ; William Duthie made
it wind- and waterproof.”
Although “Bertie” Marshall,
of Cruggleton, and Captain
John MacGillivray, of Cal-
rossie, have passed on, the
breed is still in the hands of
great men who are upholding
the tradition—each generation
better than before.
The history of the Shorthorn
in Australia is best told in
M. H. Ellis’ famous work:
77;e Beef Shorthorn in Aus-
tralia. I would like to men-
tion here the names of a few
who have contributed to make
the Shorthorn the greatest
breed of cattle in Australia.
Possibly the most famous
name in Shorthorns is that of
a property—Mount Derrimut
—which, although it did not
survive beyond 1875, has
immense influence. The Mor-
ton Shorthorns were to over-
whelm all others in succeeding
generations. From them sprang
the Bolinda Vale Stud and,
from there, Summerton Derri-
mut blood saturated all corners
of the Australian cattle-world
until Derr i m u t became
synonymous with Shorthorn.
Mount Derrimut has now
returned, since Imperial
Chemical Industries of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, Ltd.,
have lately re-established a
select Shorthorn stud there.
I have mentioned Bolinda
Vale but not Robert Clarke,
the man who made the name
famous. Another great man
was A. J. Webb, of Lindenow,
and the third name in the list
of great Victorians is that of
A. J. Simpson, of the great
Clifton Stud. Many names of
great breeders have been left
out, as there’s not space to
mention them all.
The next step in the Short-
horn story was the swing to
the Scotch type of animal, with
earlier maturity. It is generally
considered that Anthony
Hordern, of Milton Park, had
most to do with this when he
imported the great bull Master-
Key. Master-Key laid the
foundation of improved Short-
horns and was assisted by one
of the most famous cows of
all time, Martha sth (imp.).
Hordern was ably supported
by D. Roy McCaughey, who
established his famous Coon-
ong Stud on foundation-
females purchased from Mil-
ton Park. McCaughey spared
no expense in bringing from
Scotland the best that money
could buy, and his importation
of Calrossie Red Baronet was
an inspiration.
The Coonong Stud was
completely dispersed this year,
and the sale was one of the
greatest dispersal-sales of any
breed ever held. It was with
great sorrow that we all heard
that McCaughey had decided
to sell owing to ill health, but
Shorthorns are still in the
hands of competent stud-
masters, who, until the recent
ban on the importation of
cattle, had only purchased the
best bulls and females.
The influence of the stud-
master and his cattle reaches
out far and wide, until it
finally influences all the Short-
horns in Australia the

WITH LARKHILL RED POLL STUD, GOULBURN, N.S.W.
By-products of the Meat Industry
By A. B. PORTER
Half - a - century, ago,
much of the offal from
slaughtering in Sydney
was taken to sea in
barges and dumped. At small
slaughterhouses farther afield
the operators disposed of their
offal as best they could. The
best of # it was often cooked
in open kettles directly over
the fire and tallow was
skimmed-off by hand as it rose
to the surface.
Today all this has changed.
In the cities, and many of the
larger towns, slaughtering
operations have been concen-
trated into meatworks large
enough to allow the dressing
of carcasses and treatment of
by-products in an economic
manner.
In an up-to-date meatworks
all raw materials are conveyed
from slaughtering'-unit to by-
products plant by mechanised
equipment. This may be done
by air-blowing, by pumps or
by conveyors or by.a combina-
tion of these methods, depend-
ing on the general layout of
the works. Soft offal is
chopped small in a hasher and
then washed to minimise dis-
coloration of tallow by vege-
table matter. Hard material
containing bone is broken-up
in a crusher to speed treat-
ment at the cooking stage.
Better-class fats are segre-
gated from intestinal material
and separated into several
grades for the manufacture of
edible tallow or dripping and
inedible tallow of good color.
The usual type of cooking-
equipment in modern by-
products plants is the dry-
renderer, consisting of a hori-
zontal steel cylindrical vessel
surrounded by a steam-jacket
and with a shaft, equipped with
beaters, passing through the
centre. Eight-thousand to
10,000 pounds of raw material
is loaded into the cooker and
heat from the steam-jacket
cooks the charge and boils-off
the contained water till the
moisture-content falls to about
6 per cent. By this time the
fat-cells are ruptured and the
fat set free.
Several types of machine
are used to remove the fat
from the cooked material by
pressure, solid residue then
being milled to meat-meal or
meat-and-bone meal for stock-
food. Most of this product is
used by the poultry industry
as a protein-supplement in
compounding feeding-mixtures.
The successive stages of
handling involved in this pro-
cess have now been mechan-
“ Dammit, girl — ain't the bull got enough to do ?”
ised in modern plants, so that
materials flow through the
system by a series of con-
veyors. Conveyors deliver raw
material to charging-tanks
whence it is conveyed or
blown to cookers. An elec-
tronic device indicates comple-
tion of cooking and the cooker
empties itself when its dis-
charge-door is opened.
Transfer of cooked material
to the fat-expressors and of
solid residue from expressors
to cooling-, blending- and
milling-equipment is all done
automatically by conveyors,
usually of the screw-type.
The most valuable by-
product of meatworks is
tallow, and segregation of raw
materials is usually done so as
to use each type of material
in the manufacture of the best
grade of tallow it can produce.
Caul-fat, whether beef or
mutton, together with some
kidney-fat and the best of the
intestinal fat (after complete
separation from organs), forms
the basis of dripping and
edible tallow. This is usually
cooked in open vessels or
closed low-pressure digestors
with steam coming in contact
with the charge. Much of the
edible product from this
process is used in making
margarine.
Most inedible tallow is
made by cooking in dry-
renderers as described earlier,
and raw materials are segre-
gated, according to whether
they will produce tallow of
good or inferior color —the
price of inedible tallow being
controlled to a large extent
by its color.
Freshly rendered tallow
always contains particles of
protein and some moisture, and
if stored without purification
would only keep a short time.
In practice the suspended
impurities are removed either
by a centrifugal machine or
by reheating the tallow and
spraying it with water, which
causes the particles to settle
to the bottom so that clean
tallow can be run-off as a
finished product. The finished
tallow, formerly packed exclu-
sively in wooden casks, is now
either packed in 44-gallon
drums or delivered from place
to place in bulk by road-
tanker. .
A great deal of the tallow
produced 'in Australia is
absorbed by the local market.
The edible product finds an
outlet, while inedible tallow
supplies the needs of the soap-
factories for making laundry-
and toilet-soaps, soap-powders
and. various cleaning com-
pounds. Glycerine is a by-
product of the manufacture of
soap from tallow.
Surplus inedible tallow is
exported mainly to Europe,
South Africa and the Far East.
Until lately, all export tallow
has been packed in 44-gallon
drums, but the newest method
of handling is to take molten
tallow to the ship’s side in
road-tankers and pump it into
large tanks built into some
ships for bulkhandling of
various liquids. These tanks
are equipped with steam coils
which enable the ship to keep
the tallow warm on the voyage
and finally heat it to a suitable
temperature for pumping to
shore-tanks at the port of dis-
charge. As the capacities of
the ship’s tanks vary, bulk-
shipment can only be under-
taken by a works which can
store bulk-tallow in these
amounts and deliver it to the
ship within a short period of
time.
An export-trade also exists
for white mutton-tallow to
Burma, India and the Far East.
Some of this is used in the
cotton trade as part of the
filler in cotton textiles, but the
greater part goes to soap-
manufacture. Mutton-tallow

Poll Shorthorns. At a summer-
show in England in May,
1959, his Poll Shorthorns, com-
peting against horned Short-
horns, won the class of
yearling heifers and was
second in class for aged bulls
and third for yearling bulls.
The judge was one of Great
Britain’s foremost breeders
and judges. Obviously the
Poll Shorthorn is forging to
the front in the United
Kingdom.
Their hardiness and great
foraging ability especially fits
them for the far-outback areas
of Australia, while their quiet
and docile nature will keep
them to the fore wherever
good cattle are raised,
Although only established
less than 25 years in Australia,
Poll Shorthorns dominate
many of the great commercial
herds. Splendid specimens of
first-quality Poll Shorthorn
steers are produced in thou-
sands by such companies as
Vesteys, Peel River Land and
Mineral Company, New
Zealand and Australian Land
Company, Queensland
National Pastoral Co., Ltd.,
Australian Estates, Scottish
Australian Co., J and R. K.
Milson, Borthwicks Kidman
Estates, Kidman Reid and Co.,
and hundieds of others.
This year of record “kills,”
when hundreds of thousands
of cattle have been slaughtered
by the great international and
other jmeat-works on the
Queensland coast, Poll Short-
horn cattle have more than
held their own with all breeds
for quality and weight and,
because they are polled, there
is less damage to the beef and
hide on the long train-journeys
to the meat-works, so that they
show a better return to the
breeder.
Not on j y j s there sat i s f ac _
tion j n breeding top-quality
PoU shorthorns, but there’s
a j so a dditional profit, because
the store-buyer will pay more
for them. Proof of this was
shown in a sale at Charleville
(Q.) in April, 1959, when a
line of over 1000 Poll and
horned Shorthorn steers from
a well-known Northern Terri-
tory property was disposed
of. Ranging from 1| to 2\
years of age, the Polls were
sold separately from the
horned cattle and realised an
average of over £2 a head
more.


Santa Gertrud is
Why
are Santa Gertrudis always in such great demand irrespective of
seasonal conditions?
Because
1. They mature earlier.
2. They have the meat in the correct place.
3. They are tick resistant.
4. They are heat tolerant.
5. They are good “doers” in any district or climate and under any conditions.
6. They transmit these outstanding characteristics to their progeny.

of these trains could be assessed
when it is stated that two big
modern units last year moved
about 19,000-head over 400
miles from the drought-stricken
area of the Barkly Tableland
to the Queensland border.
Road-trains of the smaller
type have been responsible for
the main movement of fat-
cattle in the West Kimberleys
to the meatworks at Broome.
In Western Australia, four
road-trains, based at Meeka-
tharra, have been used exclu-
sively since the 1957 drought,
Each unit carries 16 bullocks
and the freight charge is £26
for each 100 miles for the 16
bullocks. The usual procedure
is to spell cattle at Meekatharra
for a minimum of 24 hours
before loading them onto a
t ra i n -
Road-cartage is now essential
since the Meekatharra-Wiluna
railway was closed in 1957 ; it
would otherwise mean walking
an additional 116 miles. This
method of transport proved
its value in the drought, making
it possible to get cattle from
station to market in 56 hours
and resulting in less wastage,
less labor and fresher cattle.
Around Alice Springs they
have been using small trains,
which are increasing in popu-
larity for transporting fat-
cattle from a radius of about
200 miles to the railroad to
Adelaide, so that drovers have
now almost disappeared in the
district.
An advantage of road-trains
is the elimination of risk in
cattle contracting pleuro-
pneumonia or tick-infestation,
Special attention is given to
lessening bruising in fat-cattle,
because hundreds of pounds are
lost annually from this cause
in all forms of transport,
Road-trains have also solved
the problem of transporting
bulls, because faster transport
allows little loss of vitality and
age, which is especially
important in the areas influ-
enced by monsoon conditions,
where so many of our big
cattle herds are domiciled,
Shipping
Shipping services take a
limited number of fat-cattle
from Derby and Broome
(W.A.), and other more
southern ports on the west coast
to the Perth market, and a
limited number have been
shipped to Singapore.
Recent shipments to the
Philippines from Derby,
Darwin and Townsville were
said to have been satisfactory,
but now this market has
become uncertain, because of
currency troubles and Philip-
pine Government regulations
about slaughter and distribu-
tion. Since then, shipment to
the Philippines has been cur-
tailed and cargoes from Derby
and Darwin have been sent to
meatworks at Cairns and
Townsville. This new" move-
ment is likely to continue.
For some time shipments of
cattle have been made by big
barges from ports north of
Cairns to the meatworks at that
centre. So, through the enter-
prise of shipping-firms, cattle-
owners in that part of northern
Australia have been able to
transport fat- and store-cattle
where, before, any run-off of
cattle was either absorbed
locally or, in specially favor-
able seasons, handed to a
drover to be taken over a
lonely, primitive, unimproved
stock-route to a distant market.
Air-transport
Aerial transport is at present
used only for stud-animals ;
but, in its way, it serves a very
useful purpose, because bulls
can be now landed in breeding-
herds in a few hours instead
of after a long journey by train
or droving, which would often
impair their health and con-
dition, particularly if they had
to be moved in time of drought,
The time may not be far distant
when big freighters like those
which can now move a hundred
or more troops in one load
make it possible for cattle to
be moved economically,
Already herds have been
moved from North Queensland
1° cattle-stations in New
Guinea.

Summary
To summarise, the improve-
ment jn our transport today
compared with that of, say,
1920, shows a credit in better
roads and improved motor-

is particularly suitable for this
trade for several reasons: it
is a hard fat, suitable for
blending with vegetable-oils
available in those countries,
and it does not offend the
Moslems, who abhor the pig,
or the Hindus, to whom the
cow is sacred.
The hardness of tallow
varies according to the type
of animal from which it is
made, the part of the animal
from which the fat came and
also the age of the animal. In
general, mutton-fat is hard, pig-
fat is soft, while beef-fat is
intermediate, between the two.
But tallow made from young
animals is decidedly softer
than that from mature ones.
For instance, a tallow made
exclusively from lambs is a
great deal softer than one
made from old ewes or
wethers, so that during a
period when a high proportion
of young animals is being
killed, the tallow produced will
be decidedly softer than that
made when all the stock is old.
Lower-grade offal, together
with excess bone, after
removal of fat, is often blended
with cooked blood, dried and
milled for blood-and-bone fer-
tiliser, which is extensively
used by vegetable-growers and
orchardists as well as for
pasture-improvement,
Tallow, stock-food and fer-
tiliser are the principal by-
products of the meat industry
both in quantity and in value,
but many other lines are pro-
duced in varying quantities.
When the feet are removed
from a beef-carcass the skin
and sinews are first taken for
making glue and gelatine ; the
hooves come off after scalding
and are then air-dried and
exported for making buttons
and various fancy-goods. • The
skinned feet are then cooked
gently in open tanks to pro-
duce neatsfoot-oil, and the
watery liquor can be evapor-
ated to a crude glue. Of the
solid remainder, the meat and
small bones may go to stock-
food or fertiliser, while the
shank-bones are usually ground
for bone-meal or dried and
exported for manufacture of
bone articles.
Similarly, cattle-heads yield
hide-pieces for gelatine and
horns for fancy-goods and
buttons, and, after edible meat
is removed, the remainder is
crushed and goes with other
offal to the dry-renderers. The
horns are graded into several
grades according to size and
perfection, the small and
damaged ones yielding a highly
nitrogenous fertiliser.
Hair from cattle-tails is
used by upholsterers after
being cleaned and subjected to
a curling process, not unlike
permanent-waving, to make it
as springy as possible.
The leather trade uses
albumen made from blood-
serum for surfacing and water-
proofing fine leather and kid.
The serum is made from
freshly collected cattle-blood
by a process almost identical
with that used by the blood-
bank for making serum from
human blood. A centrifugal
machine, similar to a milk-
separator, divides the blood
into a clear straw-colored serum
and a thick, almost black,
fraction containing all the
corpuscles. The serum is
treated to remove the clotting-
agent and then preservatised.
Cattle, like all cud-chewing
animals, have complex
stomachs divided into sections.
In the young milk-fed calf, one
of these sections secretes an
enzyme which curdles milk, the
first stage of its digestion. This
section of the calf’s stomach,
known in the industry as a
veil, is trimmed of fat, inflated
with compressed-air and dried
in a current of warm air.
Dried calves’ veils are the
source of rennet, used to
curdle milk in the first stage
of the manufacture of cheese.
The same active principle is
the setting-agent in junket-
tablets and junket-essence.
Sausage-casings and tennis-
strings from intestines, various
glands used in pharmaceutical
preparations, surgical-gut and
pig-hair for the manufacture
of brushware all contribute
their quota to the never-ending
stream of merchandise pro-
duced by the by-products plants
associated with the meat
industry.
And even when the dressed
carcasses of beef and lamb
reach the retail butchers’-
shops, the story of by-products
is not complete. Bones and
trimmings removed on the
cutting-block are collected for
treatment in a rendering-plant
to produce tallow and stock-
food from what would other-
wise be waste.
The story of meat industry
by-products is twofold—not
only is the economic aspect of
great importance, but a vital
role is played in the disposal
of enormous quantities of
material which would other-
wise create a problem. The
scope of this problem can be
imagined when it is realised
that after processing and dry-
ing, the by-products at Home-
bush Abattoirs alone yield an
average of over 100 tons of
tallow a week, and half as
much again jn fertiliser and
stock-foods. Extend this to
cover every meatworks in Aus-
tralia, and you will begin to
realise how much more there
is behind your roast beef than
ever reaches the butcher’s
shop.

T.B.Testing
By MARY BISHOP
A further chapter from “It’s a Dog’s Life” (Hammond
and Hammond), by the American-born wife of a
Queensland veterinary-surgeon.
Rocky's practice is a
mixed one of large
animals and small
animals. Besides the
treatment of private patients he
has a Government contract for
the testing of dairy cattle for
tuberculosis. Large - animal
cases are seen on the farms and
concern me very little, outside
the telephone and the door-
bell ; but with the small-animal
cases, domestic routine goes to
the dogs.
Domestic duties, as any man
knows, are non-urgent, and
may be postponed indefinitely,
if he happens to need his wife
to help him. He will agree that
meals should be prepared,
but a wife should be able to
prepare an excellent meal in
five-minutes flat, and without
the need to shop for ingredi-
ents. All a matter of organisa-
tion! House-cleaning is sheer
foolishness and uncalled for.
The wife of a veterinarian,
whose surgery is at home, is on
the other hand often called for.
She is handy to have about the
place to “help me with this
dog,” or put in an order for
drugs.
Husbandly things may be
said to a wife in the heat of
battle, if he .thinks she is not
restraining an animal properly,
although he knows full well it
is physically impossible to
restrain some animals. She
needs either six pairs of hands
equipped with suction-cups, or
hypnotic powers. A wife may
talk back, but she won’t quit
and she will discount his bitter
complaints about her efforts.
She sees how extremely exas-
perating it is to get no co-opera-
tion from the patient ; and how
highly-strung, nervous animals,
who shy violently at injections
and will not voluntary allow
even the simplest examination,
sorely try her husband’s
patience.
This is not a complaint. A
life of uninterrupted domestic
routine would bore me, and
even if I’m not called, I am
often there to make the
acquaintance of a small animal
on the examination-table.
In the beginning I often went
with Rocky when he T. 8.-
tested cattle. But the days were
long and the hour of our return
home depended on the whims
of capricious heifers, the deter-
mination of bullheaded bulls
and the impregnability of
fences and crushes; so that I
was apt to spend entirely too
much time away from domestic
affairs. Besides, in spite of the
employment of a series of girls
(who stay only until they get
married) the office-work piled
up.
1VT ostly I looked forward to
a day in the country;
especially in winter, for in
Queensland in wintertime a day
in the open is very appealing.
The sun is deliciously warming
but with no trace of the blast-
ing effect it has in summer. As
we drove out of town the
mountains, robed in a dia-
phanous bluish haze, were
always in the distance. The car
dipped and rose over the roll-
ing countryside spiked with
shaggy-barked gum-trees and
with grasslands sere and brown
from the winter frosts.
Kookaburras jeered at us
from the fence-posts and at
times my spirits were so high
I would jeer back, “Go ahead
and laugh, you hyenas.” The
magpies chortled over their
early morning tea of grubs and
at any one so silly as to do any
work. I soaked-in the moun-
tain view, gazed fondly at the
kookaburras, was amused by
the magpies and wished the
whole day would go on like
that. But, of course, it didn’t.
The Queensland summer is
hot —steamy hot at times. The
lolling hills are covered with
lusn grass if the rains are fre-
quent. If the rains are niggardly
or do not come at all, the grass
is as sere as in winter and the
mountains, with the scrub-fires
on their sides, look uninviting.
In the heat the kookaburras
have not the strength to jeer,
nor the magpies the inclination
to chortle. And I wilt and
droop.
To my mind, spring and
autumn do not really exist in
Queensland, although the
calendar and the Queenslander
will tell me they have arrived.
There is no very perceptible
change, certainly no dramatic
change, from season to season.
I am never tempted to sing “In
the spring tra la la,” for to me
it never comes —merely an
osmosis of winter into summer
and summer into winter.
TJut, winter or summer, the
** car arrived at the farmer’s
gate. I got out and opened the
gate. Rocky drove through and
I closed the gate. Up the lane
ana into the yard wnere there
was a flurry of fowls, who
acted as though we were intent
on running them down, and the
barking of dogs in what we
hoped was a welcome.
Heads appeared at windows
and from behind sheds, and we
had arrived. Just like the letter
said —or almost like the letter
said. Punctuality depended
upon if there had been an early-
morning call to a sick animal,
or upon the temperament of
the cattle on the last farm.
We got out of the car, the
farmer greeted us, and intro-
ductions were made. “My name
is King. This is my wife.”
There was much talk about the
weather. It was dry, hot, cold,
windy; but mostly hot and
they needed rain. “Do you
think it will rain?” Rocky
asked one farmer.
He pushed his hat to the
back of his head, looked at the
sky and said “It’ll rain.” Then,
after a pause, “It always has.”
It was my job to record ear-
tag numbers, write descrip-
tions of the cattle, and if the
cow had a name, to record that
too. Names ranged from ones
of sheer beauty, as “Blossom,”

to descriptive ones such as
“Kicker,” “Rat Tail,” and
“Three Tits.” Then there were
elegant names such as
“Damson’s Mayfair the Third,”
and common ones such as “Lil”
and “Ellie.”
Many farmers don’t know
the names of their cattle, but
the children do and. so does
his wife. When I asked one
farmer about names he told
me, “You’ll have to ask the
missus. I don’t know them. I’ve
got just one name for all of
’em.”
There were many things to
learn. One was the active range
of fresh cowdung as it splat-
tered on concrete. I reckoned
the average was five yards, and
that was without a tailwind.
I learned not to talk too
freely to the farmer’s wife until
after the testing was finished. If
I was talkative before, she
wanted to continue the conver-
sation while I wrote descrip-
tions, and it was hard enough
to hear the ear-tag numbers
and descriptions over the bark-
ing of dogs and the bellowing
of cattle.
/''Vn one farm there were two
very bellowy cows on
opposite sides of the fence.
They muzzled each other
through the fence and then
raised their heads to heaven
and bellowed. The earth and
sky vibrated. “What’s wrong
with them?” I asked.
“They’re twin heifers,”
explained the farmer, scowling.
“And they always go on like
that at the slightest separation.”
He opened a gate and let
one through to the other, and
there was peace until the two
were chased towards the bails
for testing. “The girls” couldn’t
make up their minds about
which bails they would have,
and were shouldered aside by
cows who knew which ones
they wanted. Finally the only
bails available were two which
again left them separated. They
gazed longingly at each other
over the heads of the other
cows, and bellowed.
Rocky looked up from filling
his tuberculin syringe and
shook his head. “I’ve never
seen...” His voice was
drowned by bellows. He tried
again. “Never seen anything
like it... shut up, you fools!
. . . outside a mother and
calf!”
Bellow, bellow, bellow,
bellow! In the close confines
of the bails the noise almost
lifted us from our feet. Rocky,
with his syringe filled, raced to
the bellowers, injected their
tails and opened the bail-gates.
The twins, with a last
reproachful bellow, joined
each other outside the bail-
gates, greeted each other with
bovine kisses and cantered
happily off to the paddock.
“Which goes to prove,” I
remarked, “that the customer
who makes the most fuss gets
the best service.”
On some farms the dogs
didn’t bark, the cows didn’t
bellow, no one talked more
than necessary, and my job
was easy. But usually I had
my ears perked and an expres-
sion of pain and distress on my
face as if I’d been kicked on
the shin by a heifer.
And as for heifers, I learned
very early to step aside from
any who seemed determined
to run me down. I could
attempt to head her back, but
not take too firm a stand. If
a heifer came for me I knew
my presence in front wouldn’t
stop her from going where
she was hell-bent to go.
A sharp blow on the head with
a pick-handle might have made
her veer slightly, but I had
nothing bigger than a lead
pencil.
I learned there were many
places in a cowbail where a
tall person like myself could
bump her head. Rocky has
never learned this, or perhaps
his job is more active and he
cannot always proceed with
caution. He is seldom free
from an abrasion on the fore-
head, which leads to many
facetious remarks about my
ability with the rolling-pin.
I learned to say “No” to
numerous cups of tea offered
by farmers’ wives, although I
might long for one. If we
entered their house and par-
took of their hospitality we
talked and were late for the
next farm. I mean, we were
that much later at the next
farm.
We always seemed to be late.
“Running late, Mr. King,” was
a standard greeting. The
remark was usually just a com-
ment, but at times a criticism.
The farmer didn’t have the
problems of T.8.-testing to
contend with so did not know
how unjust his criticism was.
If fate had been kind and we
could say “Yes” to a cup of
tea, it was the highlight of the
day.
I learned there were 10,000 —
or is it 20,000? —species of ants
in Queensland. Most of them
as mild-mannered, harmless
and only nuisances as sand-
wich fillings. But it was the
nippy ones who had built a
nest where I sat down under
a tree.
A bulldog is a dog with a
ferocious mien, but with an


amicable disposition. A bull-
dog-ant is about an inch long
and has nippers that shiver
your heart with fear. And so
they should. The bulldog-ant
is not amicable. You have only
to look at him to see he has a
chip on his shoulder. A bull-
dog-ant’s nest it probably the
most anti-social unit known in
society and would make a bees’
nest seem like a meeting of the
Dorcas Society.
I also gathered informa-
tion on the small bush-fly. He
has a family, genus and species
which I have never gone into.
As far as I’m concerned his
parentage is doubtful. Probably
a mesalliance between a
common house-fly and a per-
sistent mosquito. He would
buzz round and round my nose
and take time off occasionally
to dart viciously at my eyes.
This dear wee insect has no
weapons of offence other than
his persistence, but he has that
and patience too. I could slap
at him, but I wouldn’t hit him.
I could try to blow him away,
but he has full knowledge of
riding-out draughts. I would
run away from him but I never
lost him, and after several
minutes of such gymnastics, I
would gladly have swallowed
him, if I could, to get rid of
his persistent presence.
T learned a bail is a place
■*- where cows are milked. A
bail might be two poles stuck
out in the open with means of
confining the cow’s head, or it
might be a super-duper store-
bought metal arrangement
erected in a building with a
concrete floor. The fanciness
of a bail is of no conse-
quence to my husband. They
are good or bad, depending
on how well they confine the
patient and how much room
there is available to get at the
cow’s head to read ear-tag
numbers.
A crush could be almost
anything: a hastily constructed
means of confinement made
of chicken-wire and old bed-
stead-heads, or a sturdy
rectangular yard long enough
to hold several beasts at a
time and not wide enough for
them to turn around in. A
heifer would probably be able
to turn around in it, or crawl
under it; but then a heifer
can do anything, anyway.
The main qualification of a
crush is that it should be
strong enough to hold nervous
heifers and recalcitrant bulls.
A flimsily constructed or aged
one with rotten rails is enough
to give a vet. apoplexy on the
spot. It is hard enough indue-
ing the heifers and the bulls
into the crush. It is too much
to have them break out before
they are tested!
Yarding heifers into a crush
is an exasperating procedure.
The farmer is handicapped at
first because I am there and
he doesn’t like to swear in
front of a lady, but after the
animals have broken away
from the gate of the crush
half-a-dozen times, he forgets
me and lets rip. Then pro-
“ ‘Okay,’ she said, ‘you go your Way and I’ll go
mine ’ —and she did!”
fanity blends with the crack
of the stockwhip, the bellow-
ing of cattle and the yapping
of dogs, and makes a symphony
of sound that means they are,
at last, yarding the heifers.
Clubs and missiles are some-
times used as a means of per-
suasion, but their use is never
premeditated and they consist
of whatever is readily at hand,
ranging from branches of trees
almost too big to lift, to small
twigs because there is nothing
bigger about. The missiles
range from rocks big enough
to knock-out a bull to harm-
less dollops of dried cow-
dung.
“They will kill the poor
things,” I would mutter to
myself, but the farmer had
to be quick and his aim good
on a moving target, and if
clubs and missiles did connect,
the result was a glancing blow
that acted neither as a deter-
rent nor a hastener.
HThe test consisted of an
-*• injection of tuberculin —
the test fluid—into the caudal
fold of the tail. The tests
could then be “read” from 72
to 96 hours afterwards.
The farmer knew that when
reading-day came if the vet.
found a swelling on the tail
where the needle went in, the
cow had tuberculosis and she
was condemned and slaught-
ered under Government
inspection. Then, when he
had replaced his cow with a
T.8.-free one and filled-in
forms and waited, he got a
cheque for the cow. “But,”
a few complained, “not for
anything like what she’s
worth.”
I made a few inquiries in
veterinary circles about the
value of a cow infected with
tuberculosis. The consensus
of opinion was that she was
about as valuable as a plague-
ridden rat.
And from the day the cattle
were injected until reading-
day, most farmers kept an eye
on their cows’ tails. If they
saw swellings they already
knew some of their guilty
cattle, but all reactions are notj
visible and can only be detected
when felt, and so they did not
know all their diseased animals.
One day a farmer and his
family met us looking like the
grasshoppers had been through
after a long drought. He was
finished —done for! He
scarcely had the strength to
raise his voice. “Mr. King,
they are all reactors. They’ve
all got it.”
Rocky lifted a startled face
from the record-books he was
getting from the car. “All
reactors!”
He nodded sadly.
“Even the heifers?”
“Yes,” he sighed, “even the
heifers and the bull.”
There was a line of cows
waiting in the bails and Rocky
walked behind them and felt
the injection sites. When he
finished he turned to the
farmer. “Show me your re-
actions.”
He lifted a tail. “There,”
he said, and pointed to a spot
where a bone in the coccyx
made a lump on the tail when
it was lifted.
He let out a long relieved
sigh when it was explained
the lump was a natural one.
His wife dried her tears and
smiled, and the children danced
about. Mr. King was a won-
derful man. He had made all
their cattle not reactors!
Reading-day was not always
happy because cattle were
found that did react to the
test. On one farm Rocky
called from the crush “Here’s
one.” It was the first animal
read, and a heifer. I got out
the red pencil to mark a re-
actor on the records. Then
followed one call after another
like the swing of an axe, until
seven heifers out of ten were
condemned.
“I don’t understand all the
reactions in your heifers,” said
Rocky, concerned. “Are they
your own breeding or did you
buy them?”
The farmer shrugged and
di d n’t seem perturbed.
“They’re my own.”
Rocky shook his head. “I
hate to tell you this, but pre-
pare yourself for more among
your cows. These heifers have
picked it up from drinking milk
from infected cows. I’ve
never found this high a
centage among heifers before.”
The farmer said nothing;
merely mounted his horse and
left to bring in his cows.
“They were beautiful
heifers,” I mourned. “So fat
and sleek.”
“Beautiful for what? If I
had a farm they wouldn’t be
allowed on it ten minutes. The

farmer took it calmly. I’m
more upset than he is.”
They were mostly fine-
looking cows, too, and I felt
sicker and sicker as I red-
pencilled number after num-
ber in the record-book.
Rocky finished read-
ing he had condemned
over half the herd. My sym-
pathy went out to the farmer
and his wife, although they
didn’t seem to need any.
Rocky, as chief executioner,
looked as if he needed it more.
“Sorry,” he said, shaking his
head, “but that’s the way it
is. I’ll be back to test your
herd again in a few months
and you can expect to lose
more. Some cattle that passed
the test today may be recently
infected and won’t react until
next time.”
He washed and dried his
hands. “I will say you’re tak-
ing this very well. Most
farmers would be in tears.”
“I knew I had it coming,”
was the laconic reply.
“Trouble with cattle and pigs
condemned at the abattoirs.
The disease was here when
my father had the farm.”
“The poor man,” I said to
Rocky on the way to the next
farm. “What a blow!”
Rocky drove along in silence
for a while. “I don’t think it
was a blow to him at all,
although I’ve just made him
several hundred pounds
poorer. Most of us don’t like
to face-up to our troubles, but
when we do and make a start
on doing something about
them we feel better. He’s
known, I’d say, for thirty years
that he had tuberculosis on
the farm and he’s had heavy
losses because of it. He’s also
had it on his conscience.
Today he took the step he
was afraid to take because
he had to. He’s a happier man
for it.
“That was a bad herd, and
I haven’t found many that bad.
Before compulsory - testing
came in the Government vets,
were doing something about it
—as much as they could with
the staff available. Pigs get
T.B. when they are fed milk
from infected cows and so
when pigs arrived at the
abattoirs with T.B. an attempt
was made to trace them back
to the farm they came from
and the farms were tested.
They apparently didn’t get
around to all of them.” Then
he added darkly “Of course,
there are ways of disposing
of animals other than to the
abattoirs, and some of the
smart boys avoided being
tested that way. Some of the
men in other districts are find-
ing a lot more tuberculosis
than I am.”
Rocky slapped the steering-
wheel of the car with his hand.
“And for the price of just one
pig, any of the farmers who
knew they had tuberculosis
could have had their herds
tested long ago. Why, if
they’d brought the fact to the
attention of the State veterin-
ary surgeon, instead of trying
to hide it, they could probably
have had it done for nothing!
But they didn’t, and have
suffered heavy losses for
years.”
“Let me see,” I said, “if I
remember what I learned in
my bacteriology class. It’s
been a long time since I had
to write an exam, on the sub-
ject. There are three strains
of T.8.-bacilli. The human,
the bovine, and the avian. The
avian strain may be trans-
mitted from chickens to pigs ;
the human strains from humans
to humans and sometimes to
dogs, the dog usually getting
it from its owner. The bovine
strain may be transmitted to
humans as well as from cow
to cow and from cows to pigs.”
“That’s roughly the picture.
Generalised T.B. in humans —
the killer—is almost always
caused by the human strains,
the bovine strains causing bone
and glandular tuberculosis in
children. And before T. 8.-
testing and pasteurisation of
milk there was plenty of that.”
Tn many parts of the world
the test for tuberculosis in
cattle has had a stormy past.
“How could you tell a cow
had T.B. by jabbing her tail
with a needle with some of
that stuff in the bottle?” asked
the farmer. “Look at Bill
Smith’s cattle, a rum lot if
there ever was one, and his
cattle passed the test. Look at
my cow here. In the pink and
you say it has T. 8.”
Government vets, were
chased off farms with pitch-
forks and sawn-off shotguns
and the war was on. But now
the battle has been fought and
won. Condemned cattle are
slaughtered under Government
inspection. The farmer may
be present if he wishes. Such
is the sensitivity of “that stuff
in the bottle” that the test is
over 99 per cent, right. The
test has proved itself efficient
and the farmer now recognises
it has come to stay. Some
farmers may be annoyed
because they must have their
cattle tested, but they seldom
query the result of the test.
The usual remark after the
farmer finds out his herd is
clean is “Fine thing this test.
Should have been done long
ago.”
A story was told me of a
farmer, one of the early
doubters of the test, with a
valuable bull. The State
veterinary-officer tested his
herd and found the bull to be
the only reactor. The farmer
ranted and raved. The test
was no good! It was a ruse
to get his valuable bull away
from him. He made so much

Is it really a sun, after all?
Who Designed the
“Rising Sun”?
Rising Sun as worn by the Diggers.
Proudly worn by Aus-
tralian soldiers in four
wars, the “Rising Sun”
badge has become an
integral part of Digger tradi-
tion, as was shown by the
storm raised a couple of years
ago when it was suggested that
it was to disappear altogether
from the uniforms of the troops
in Malaya. In official records,
of course, there is no such
thing as a “Rising Sun” ; the
quartermaster’s store knows it
only as “Badge, Common-
wealth, large (for hat); small
(for collar).” And according
to official stories the badge
doesn’t represent a rising sun at
all, and never did.
The badge was known to the
men of the First A.I.F. as the
Rising Sun, but apparently no
one at that time worried about
delving into its origins. Later,
when interested persons began
to trace its history, they found
that the. task wasn’t so simple
as they expected. General
Bridges, first commander of the
A.1.F., adopted the badge
almost as a matter of course
when the first volunteers went
into camp in 1914 ; it had been
part of the uniform of the
Citizen Forces raised under the
universal-training scheme from
1911. Before that it had been
used (since 1904) by the Staff
Corps and, in an earlier form,
by the Australian Common-
wealth Horse in the Boer War.
'yt/ r HO was responsible for the
design of the badge and
what does it represent? The
Army seems now to have no
doubts on the matter. In a
recruiting-advertisement which
appeared in several newspapers
Trophy-of-arms at Victoria
Barracks, Melbourne.
last year was a sketch similar
to the one shewn above and
below it was this caption:
This is the true story. The
illustration above is an authentic
reproduction of the original trophy
of arms mounted above Major-
General Sir Edward Hutton’s door-
way in Victoria Barracks, Mel-
bourne, from 1902 to 1904. This
mounted trophy consisted of a
red semicircular board on which
alternate triangular cut-and-thrust
sword-bayonets radiated from a
brass crown design. From this
doorway trophy design caiiie the
Rising Sun badge to gain honor
and fame all over the world.
That is the explanation gener-
ally given for the origin of the
badge. Its most usual form is
that given in We of the A.I.F.
First badge of 1st Australian
Commonwealth Horse, 1902.
According to this version, when
the Ist Australian Common-
wealth Horse was raised
for service in 'South Africa
at the beginning of 1902
the question of a special badge
for it came up. A number of
suggestions were made to
Major-General Hutton, then
newly appointed to organise the
Commonwealth Military
Forces, but he rejected designs
incorporating kangaroos, emus,
wattles and waratahs, and said
he wanted something with more
of a martial flavor.
He pointed to the trophy of
arms on his wall and said,
“Something like that.” So
“something like that” was pro-
duced and approved and the
first badges were quickly manu-
factured and issued.
Tt is difficult to establish just
when this explanation was
first circulated, but the Aus-
tralian Encyclopaedia ascribes
it to “research by the late J. L.
Treloar when Director of the
Australian War Memorial.” It
has an authentic flavor, but it
has never entirely convinced
the many doubters who claim
that the “Rising Sun” not only
looks like a rising sun, but was
meant to look like one. They
maintain that not only do the
“rays” on the present badge
look nothing like the bayonets
on the trophy, but that they
never did, not even in the
original design of 1902.
This, of course, is opinion
only and proves nothing. But
the doubters claim their case
rests on stronger grounds than
opinion. Writing in “Sabre-
tache,” the journal of the
Military Collectors Society of
Australia, in June, 1958, B. J.
Videon quotes Robert Gray, a
South Australian member of
the society:
Sir Edward Hutton assumed the
position of G.O.C. Common-
wealth Military Forces on January
29, 1902. The badge was issued
to “D” Company, Ist Australian
Commonwealth Horse, in Brisbane
prior to leaving for Sydney on
January 26, 1902, where it joined
the N.S.W. unit of this force. They
left Sydney in the transport
Custodian on February 18, 1902.
If these facts are right, then
General Hutton could hardly
be the originator of the badge.
In that case, who was? Robert
Gray has an answer to this
question, too:
The badge was designed by Col.
Cox Taylor and is taken from a
part of the hat-badge as worn by
the old 6th (Australian Rifle Regi-
ment) N.S.W. Infantry. He was
attached to this unit in 1897 and
designed the badge for the regi-
ment. The Ist Australian Com-
monwealth Horse was commanded
by Col. J. S. Lyster and it was this
officer who asked his adjutant
(Capt. Cox Taylor) to design a
badge for the regiment.
Lieut.-Colonel P. V. Vernon,
of Sydney, w'rote to Robert
Later design worn by 1st Australian
Commonwealth Horse.
Gray after reading the
“Sabretache” article and asked
the source of his information.
Gray referred him to W. F.
Mullaney, honorary secretary
of the Old Comrades Associa-
tion of the 6th N.S.W. Infantry.
Vernon visited Mullaney, a
former Warrant-Officer Class 1,
who joined the 6th N.S.W.
Infantry in 1898, when Cox
Taylor was its staff-officer.
Mullaney said that he had
known Cox Taylor well from
that time on, and he recalled
Cox Taylor telling him that
he had been directed by the
C.O. of the Ist Austra-
lian Commonwealth Horse,
to design a badge for the.unit.
Cox Taylor had done so, using
the central portion of the badge
of his (and Mullaney’s) old
regiment. Mullaney said the
theme of this design was “The
sun rising over the crown of
the Empire on which it never
sets.”
Lieut.-Colonel Vernon has
also discussed the badge with
Colonel A. A. White, M.C.,
Badge worn by 6th N.S.W. Infantry,
1897-1903.
who told him that Major Bill
Harris, who, in 1902, was
orderly-clerk in the Ist Austra-
lian Commonwealth Horse, and
who died a few months ago,
had told him on a number of
occasions that he (Harris) per-
sonally drew the design for the
badge at the direction of the
Adjutant, Capt. Cox Taylor.
None of the foregoing is
courtroom evidence, and in the
57 years that have passed since
the badge was designed most
of the men who could have
given expert testimony have
died. However, Vernon has
traced a letter written by
Colonel J. H. A. Lee, second-in-
command of the Australian
Commonwealth Horse, to Cox
Taylor, and which was pub-
lished in the Sydney “Daily
Telegraph” on August 9, 1924.
Portion of it reads:
Shortly after you reported for
duty [as Adjutant] I remember the
C.O. (Col. Lyster) raising the ques-
tion of a badge. None had
been designed, and as we were the
first troops to be formed under
the new Commonwealth he was
anxious the badge should be a dis-
tinctive one. He asked you to try
as he said he knew you were a bit
of a draughtsman. I remember very
well the various designs you pro-
duced, prominent among them being
the Rising Sun design. This was
the most attractive, but looked
rather Japanese. It was, however,
accepted, and became our badge.
The badge of the 6th N.S.W.
Infantry is reproduced above.
There seems no reason to doubt
that in this case the rays above
the crown represent a rising
sun. The Cox Taylor story has
the ring of truth, and is at least
substantial enough to warrant
the Army examining its
records thoroughly to see
whether a final answer can be
found to a most intriguing
question.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Spring Form
Ideal weather conditions, a
real Sydney spring day,
attracted 31,000 to the Tatter-
sail’s meeting at Randwick last
Saturday—the best for the
club in many seasons. Tote
turnover of £llO,OOO was up
£15,000 on last year’s figures
for the same fixture.
From an overnight and
early-course price of 7 to 4
New Zealander Supertax
drifted rapidly in the betting
on the Chelmsford Stakes and
started at 7 to 2, with 4’s
available in places—surprising
in view of his brilliant dis-
play when dead-heating for
second with Perouse to Up And
Coming in the Warwick Stakes.
Backing of other runners, par-
ticularly three-year-old Polo
Prince, may have caused the
drift, and though at no stage
was Supertax dangerous he
could do better over the longer
journey of the Cups in
Melbourne.
• • • •
Valerius found the nine
furlongs of the Chelmsford
too short, but his third
impressed. Polo Prince weak-
ened badly, and three-year-
olds Chartwell and Prince
Verdi failed completely. Pique
and Beechley—first and second
—drew attention to immediate
prospects in races for the three-
year-olds.
• • • •
Perhaps it would be wise
not to attach too much
importance to the Chelmsford
form. Mostly handicappers,
some starters may show
improved form when back to
handicaps among these
Valerius, Bardshah, Royal
Jester and Macdougal certainly
should. All are well fancied
for the Metropolitan, and all
will carry several pounds less
weight.
Grenoble’s win in the Tram-
way Handicap, his first since
scoring in the Doncaster last
April, promised a good Epsom
chance. He seems bound to
derive benefit from the outing,
and eight furlongs is about his
best distance. He resumed
racing at Warwick Farm on
August 22, when sixth to
Noholme; a fortnight later
he was a fast-finishing fourth
to Court Gold at Canterbury,
and trainer Frank Lewis hds
since kept him going strongly
at Rosebery. The six-year-old
was ridden on Saturday by
apprentice C. Pearson, whose
71b. allowance reduced the
weight to 8.4. It’s likely that
McGrowdie will have the
Epsom mount.
• • • •
Though most of In Love’s
wins have been in Welters, if
he has a crack at the Epsom,
he could, with 8.3, have a
reasonable chance. He carried
9.13 in his win under Satur-
day’s Highweight conditions.
This time last year Bold
Pilot, after winning the
“It's the last time We tell THAT jockey to use
his discretion !”
Guineas at Rosehill, failed as
a stayer and finished well back
in the A.J.C. Derby. In the
autumn he won the w.-f.-a.
Rawson Stakes in course-
record time at Rosehill, but
in the Doncaster he once more
faded quickly. Last Saturday
he won Tattersall’s 10-furlongs
Spring Handicap in style sug-
gesting a Metrop. chance. He
is weighted at 8.7, which, how-
ever, may be rather close to
the poundage of such others as
Valerius, Bardshah and Balfast,
all on 8.5. However, though
it was a moderate lot behind
Bold Pilot on Saturday, he
won well. He is by Bold
Buccaneer (imp.) from Flying
Gal by Law Maker (imp.).
Race-form didn’t point to
Duty winning Tattersall’s
Novice at a mile-and-a-half,
but few of the rest had any
form at that distance, either.
Few Novice events are run at
12 furlongs, but it would be
an excellent idea to stage them
more frequently, instead of
catering so much for squibby
gallopers.
* * *
Two of the winners at the
midweek Warwick Farm meet-
ing—Nyngan, in the mile
Maiden Handicap, and Pay
Lady in the 11-furlongs
Encourage—are by the im-
ported French sire Osborne 11,
who so far hasn’t had many
runners, but holds an excellent
winning average. He was a
speedy high-class stayer in
England, with 13 wins at from
6 furlongs to 2 miles 3 fur-
longs. In winning the Don-
caster Cup ( 2f miles) he
carried 9.6, and in the Good-
wood Stakes (2 miles 3 fur-
longs) he won with 9.7, the
highest weight carried to vic-
tory in that race since 1835,
and that’s going back a bit.
Judging by the winning per-
formances at the Farm, the
Osbornes are going to play an
important role in staying
events in this and following
seasons. Nyngan’s display was
remarkable for a minor event.
He was second-last in a drawn-
out field of 24 half-a-mile from
home, yet won easing-up.
Much more will be seen of
this brilliant three-year-old,
and pretty soon, especially on
a rain-affected track.
• • • •
Three-year-old filly Weea-
mera has won two races, each
on a rain-soaked course; one
at Randwick last April; the
other her easy win at the
Warwick Farm midweek fix-
ture, when, like many of the
progeny of her sire, Delville
Wood (imp.), she revelled in
the soft going. Her dam,
Gleeful, is by Midstream
(imp.) from Elation by Beau
Pere (imp.). Norman Wheeler
bred Weeamera at Kia-Ora
Stud, Scone (N.S.W.).

The Rosehill Guineas (due
this coming Saturday) was
won last year by Bold
Pilot, beating Prince Kerdieil
and Sir Blink. All three
competed in the A.J.C. Derby,
won by Skyline from Sir
Blink and Prince Kerdieil.
Skyline didn’t run in the
Guineas, but won the Hill
Stakes furlongs) at Rose-
hill. Since 1941, when Laureate
won the Rosehill Guineas and
then the A.J.C. Derby, the
only winners of the two races
have been Moorland (1943),
Tea Rose (1944), Caranna
(1955) and Tulloch (1957).
Thirty years ago Phar Lap
landed the double. Field for
Saturday’s Guineas is expected
to include the best three-year-
olds, and the running should
certainly give a pointer or
two to classic prospects.
* * *
Sunbloom —dam . of Top
Pilot, winner at Ipswich last
Saturday—has done well at
the stud. Her other winning
progeny have included Wayside
Bloom (A.J.C. Adrian Knox
Stakes), Star Bloom (A.J.C.
Sledmere Handicap) and Good
Bloom (a Queensland winner).
A half-sister to Freckles,
holder of the Australian record
(1.22) for seven furlongs,
established in 1942, Sunbloom
is by Beau Pere (imp.) from
Suntint by Paper Money
(imp.) from Sunglow (related
to Manfred) by Multiform.

w.-f.-a. Craiglee Stakes was
regarded as a match between
Sir Blink and Chicola, the two
Victorians most prominent on
Cups charts. Their only
opponents were Vogel, who
had never won beyond a mile,
and Contador, who had never
won at all. And Vogel led all
the way to win easily enough,
with Chicola and Sir Blink
dead - heating three - quarters
of a length behind him.
Owned by W. R. Kemball,
who races Lord, Vogel was
bred in New Zealand and is
a five-year-old chestnut geld-
ing by Sabaean from Hunter’s
Lass.
It was said here last week that
it was hard to see Sir Blink repeat-
ing last year’s Caulfield Cup win ;
the Craiglee run substantiated that
opinion. Chicola’s mission is the
Melbourne Cup, in which she has
8.9, exact weight for age. She
will appreciate the long journey,
but she will have to improve a lot.
• • • •
The bright spot of the day’s
racing was Scenic Star’s suc-
cess in the six-furlongs North-
cote Handicap. Having her
first start for over four months,
the six-year-old Moondust
mare, burdened with 9.10 and
conceding up to 331 b. to the
opposition, had a clear-cut
win from Caulfield Cup hope
Gabonia. It was Scenic Star’s
fourth success in a row —she
had notched a hat-trick before
going for a spell. One of those
wins was at Randwick last
March, when she took the
Osborne Handicap with 9.11.
Randwick will see her again
for the Epsom, and with 8.13
she will be a big danger in
the rich mile. She can get that
distance all right—at Moonee
Valley last April she careered
away with a mile race after
starting from the extreme out-
side of the field. Before head-
ing north Scenic Star will
tackle the seven - furlongs
Invitation Stakes at Caulfield
on Show Day, September 24.
• • • •
Nether Gold, who scored his
first 12-furlongs win at Caul-
field last Saturday week, led
all the way over that distance
in the September Handicap.
An aged Rolled Gold gelding,
he has only 7.10 in the Caul-
field Cup, 171 b. less than he
carried last Saturday. Still,
the Caulfield Cup’s a bit
different.
Severest blow in a punish-
ing day for punters was Polo
Bay’s defeat in the second heat
of the 10-furlongs Burleigh
Handicap (three-year-olds). It
was rather a curious race.
Polo Bay, though a maiden,
has been spoken of as a Cup
hope, and was considered
almost unbeatable in the weak
field, being sent out at 2-to-l
on! He failed badly ; soundly
beaten by Man of Ceylon,
whose only other success had
been in a country Maiden event.
Trainer Mick Alessio and
Westralian rider Frank Treen
combined in a long-shot double
at Flemington, with Man of
Ceylon the first leg. The other
was Vermont Star, who also
beat the punters’ elect, Trel-
lios. Vermont Star rightly
carried the minimum weight in
the second Kingsford High-
weight—a five-year-old Billet
gelding, he’d never before
looked like winning a metro-
politan race. He gave a dash-
ing display to clear right away
for a four-lengths win. Trellios,

performed Jalna, an Adrian
Knox Stakes winner.

The Landau stock are having a
good season, and it seems that this
handsome sire b'y English Derby
winner Dante is going to have a
big effect on Australian racing as
his progeny mature. In the first
of the season’s two-year-old trials
at Caulfield last week four of his
offspring won heats. Form in these
trials can be deceptive —there’s no
penalty if a horse is restrained
from doing its best —but most
watchers marked-down the Landau-
Spitfire filly Impulsive as likely to
star in the early juvenile events
for her sex. She cut-out the four
furlongs in 48isec., to win easily.
Her dam was a very smart galloper.
Easiest winner of the 11 trials was
Milverton, a youngster by Sweet
William from Girella, and a brother
to Craig William, who looked a
champion before he broke-down
last spring. Milverton won his heat
by 10 lengths in 48 3/5. Two of
the youngsters bought by Fred
Astaire while he was here to make
“On the Beach - ’ ran in the trials.
His 6100gns. Star Kingdom-
Persist colt Anything was second
in his heat, and his filly Far Out
(Star Kingdom-Mirrilee), who cost
2200gn5., won her heat easily.
Another Star Kingdom colt, Star
City, although unplaced, looked an
early winner. Fastest winner of
the day was Wallingford, by Chavey
Down and from champion mare

Trots
On Saturday night, with
another good crowd of over
19,000, N.Z. pacer Guiseppe,
second to Victorian Marciano
a week earlier, broke badly
at the start of the Harold
Park Handicap, losing several
lengths, but, helped by the
slow pace, he took charge at
the bell and hung on gamely
to stall-off fast-finishing back-
marker Maestro’s Melody.
Guiseppe needs one more win
to qualify for the £5OOO Anni-
versary Cup. Loreto Noel ran
a very impressive trial for the
Trotters’ Cup (to be run at
the Anniversary Carnival next
month) by winning the
Trotters’ Handicap from
48yds. behind, with scratch-
markers Wise Admiral and
Merry Dance in the places.
These three, however, were the
only ones to get away cleanly,
the rest of the field losing
ground early. J. Forrest, driv-
ing Bank Account, was sus-
pended for a month for
causing interference.

ships (1952-58). To win the
title Yorkshire had to score
215 in 103 min. on the last
day of the season—and they
did it, with seven minutes and
five wickets to spare. They
won, you might say, holus-
bolus —at least, the winning
run, a four, was hit by John
Bolus. Worth recalling the
rumpus created by the appoint-
ment, at the beginning of 1958,

“Recorder”: Australian
track and field athletics having
world-record holders in Herb
Elliott and Albert Thomas, and
Australian swimming able to
boast of a whole batch of
world-record holders, it would
be natural for each sport to
look with pleasure on its
balance-sheet. Swimming cer-
tainly can. From the national
championships held at Hobart
in February there was a net
profit of almost £4OOO, and
there’s now £14,000 in the
“international” fund to send
swimmers abroad. The picture
changes when you look at the
return of £65 which the Tas-
manian Athletic Association
made from its promotion this
year of the national track and
field championships. Reasons
are that swimmers put on a
show in a small arena at night
and draw packed houses, while
athletes compete on big tracks
and muddle through in day-
light hours kidding themselves
they can draw crowds away
from other sporting-activities.

already run into £40,000. Full
cost is estimated at £75,000,
all expenses of competitors
being met and big prizemoney
on top. The souvenir-pro-

refereed games at the turn of
the century. To celebrate the
completion of Ken’s 25th year
as a ref., the Union authorities
presented him with a new
whistle, mounted on a sprint-
ing footballer. Ken reckons
he’s “reffed” at least 6000
matches, and intends trying to
add 25 per cent, before he
retires. His philosophy on
Union football is that the ref.
should be the 31st player on
the field, not a teacher who

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
NEW COMMUNIST CLASS
Tn the course of an article
•*- in “Problems of Com-
munism” predicting that in all
Communist countries a new
middle-class “embracing the
technicians, managers, skilled
workers and other specialists
of modem industrial society”
will rise and displace the revo-
lutionary ruling-class which
brought the regime to power
and consolidated it, Swiss-
born journalist Ernst Halperin
notes that only in the Soviet
Union is this class emerging
so far:
“Created under Communist
dictatorship, yet unrelated by
tradition to a pre-revolutionary
past, it is emerging as a chal-
lenge to the order which
brought it forth.
“The accessibility of the
Soviet population for public-
opinion research is of course
very limited, in spite of the
growing areas of contact
between Westerners and Soviet
citizens in private as well as
public life. Yet, with the
information we do already
possess, and with the help of
the ever - more - numerous
analytical studies of Soviet life
and institutions published in
the West, it is possible to draw
a tentative political profile of
the Soviet Union’s rising new
elite.
“Unlike Dr. Zhivago, the
great majority of the Soviet
new middle-class seems to
approve of the October Revo-
lution in principle and to
consider its achievements a
progressive step in history. The
same measure of appreciation
is apparently accorded to the
most important accomplish-
ment of the Stalin era —
industrialisation.
“Furthermore, the 40 years
of the regime’s ceaseless and
all-pervading propaganda have
had their effect on the new
middle-class: its vision of the
non-Communist world has
been distorted and its concep-
tion of Soviet achievement
exaggerated. There is thus no
justification for believing that
the new middle-class is funda-
mentally anti-Communist. On
the other hand, there is no
indication that this population-
group, and particularly its most
important component, the
technical intelligentsia, is very
much concerned with Com-
munist ideology as such.
“The Soviet middle-class
has exchanged Communist
ideology for a virulent national-
ism which has been gathering
strength ever since the Soviet
victory in World War 11. For
that victory the ‘1920’ genera-
tion paid with the highest
sacrifices, and the war remains
its most decisive character-
forming experience.
“It should be noted, how-
ever, that the deep involve-
ment in World War II has not
GLAN WILLIAMS, IN LONDON “NEWS CHRONICLE ”
isolated the new middle-class
from the rest of society or
transformed it into a conspira-
torial fraternity—as happened
to the Yugoslav and the
Chinese Communists in con-
nection with their partisan past
and to the. Soviet ‘l9oo’ genera-
tion after its revolutionary
and civil-war experience.
“The contrary indeed is
true; in the ‘Great Patriotic
War,’ the ‘1920’ generation
fought side-by-side with its
non - party contemporaries,
sharing the hardships and the
victory alike. For the entire
younger Soviet generation this
was a uniting rather than a
divisive experience.
“It is true, of course, that
the early stages of the war had
a sobering impact on the Com-
munists of the T92o’ genera-
tion, Party propaganda had
impressed upon their minds a
totally false picture about the
superiority of Soviet techno-
logy on the one hand, and the
fragility and imminent dis-
integration of the ‘capitalist’
world, including Fascist Ger-
many, on the other. These
illusions broke-up under the
blows of German armor- and
air-power. But the final vic-
tory filled the fighting Soviet
generation with a new strong
faith in the capacity of the
Soviet Union,* and this self-
assurance has been further
strengthened by the rapid pace
of post-war economic develop-
ment and by more recent
Soviet scientific and techno-
logical achievements.
“All that has been said so
far by no means implies that
the new middle-class faces the
regime and the current condi-
tions in the Soviet Union with
uncritical approval. On the
contrary, it has called for many
concrete reforms and has
exacted them from the Govern-
ment with increasing success.
Its primary concern is an
improvement in the standard
of living, and this issue has
received increasingly promin-
ent treatment in Government
and party declarations ever
since Stalin’s death.
“In spite of all the official
cant about the primacy of
heavy industry, the share of
consumer-goods in the national
product has been rising con-
tinuously. And Khrushchev’s
recent measures for decentral-
isation of the Soviet economy
certainly had as one of its
purposes the increased produc-
tion of consumer-goods and
foodstuffs.
“But the Soviet managerial
and technical intelligentsia has
another reason to be vitally
interested in industrial decen-
tralisation. In a centrally
administered planned economy
the man -on - the - spot the
production - manager or the
engineer —is at the mercy of
a distant centre of authority
which is ignorant of conditions
in the individual plant, and
which often bases its decisions
on political rather than econo-
mic considerations. While the
Soviet production - managers
have been armed with very
little authority, they have been
held responsible for the fulfil-
ment of their production-
quotas. In order to satisfy
the planners they have thus
been frequently forced to dis-
regard official channels and to
acquire necessary raw materials
and machinery illegally.
“Khrushchev’s reorganisa-
tion of industrial administra-
tion in the spring of 1957 did
away with some of the worst
excesses of the highly cen-
tralised system, but it was a
half-measure only; it short-
ened the channels of command,
but failed to transfer the
direction of production to the
plant - managers themselves.
There is little doubt in the
author’s mind that sooner or
later this last step will have
to be taken.
“Another important element
in the programme of the
Soviet new middle-class is the
call for freedom from fear.
This demand has a double
significance: in the realm of
internal politics it aims at a
reduction of police super-
vision and a firm establishment
of the rule of law; in the
sphere of foreign policy it bids
for a termination of the cold
war. This is not to say, how-
ever, that the new middle-class
has developed any foreign-
policy concepts of its own. It
is indeed questionable, in view
of its strong nationalism,
whether this class would at
this juncture be ready to accept
the foreign-policy concessions
without which a normalisation
of the international situation
is unthinkable.
“Most of the demands of
the new middle-class are dia-
metrically opposed to the
interests of the totalitarian-
party apparatus: yet, because
of the growing strength of the
T92o’ generation, the succes-
sors of Stalin have felt com-
pelled to treat its wishes with
ever more regard, and were
thus inexorably led into con-
flict with their own contem-
poraries and class brethren in
the party apparatus.
“This was the fate of Malen-
kov ; and Khrushchev, the

man who, with the help of the
party organisation, toppled
him from power, has long since
become involved in the same
clash of interests.
“In the defence of his posi-
tion Khrushchev must increas-
ingly rely on the political
support of the ‘1920’ genera-
tion. It is not his intention,
of course, to break the power
of the totalitarian party; his
aim is rather to save Com-
munist totalitarianism by
modernising it and harmonis-
ing it with the interests of the
rising new middle-class.
“This will be an extremely
difficult task, and even though
Khrushchev now appears very
strong indeed, his ultimate
success is by no means cer-
tain. Whatever the outcome,
it is certain to affect the
destiny of the Communist bloc
as well as of the rest of the
world.”
Not So Great Leap
Come editorial comment on
the drastic revision by the
Chinese Communist party’s
central committee of the
nation’s huge production plan
for the current year:
London “Economist”: “This
involves cutbacks that are far
more serious than anything
even Chinese drought and
floods —which have hit agricul-
ture badly this summer—could
account for. According to the
official newsagency, the com-
mittee ‘re-examined this year’s
plan for the development of
the national economy and
found that the original targets
were somewhat too high and
need to be appropriately
adjusted.’ The projected
‘great leap forward’ was in fact
transformed into a skip: the
Chinese planners have reverted
to the target-figures of the
second five-year plan, an-
nounced in September, 1956,
and condemned, two years
later, as overcautious.
“Not 18-million but 12-
million tons of steel will be
produced this year ; 335-million
tons of coal instead of 380;
for grain, last year’s output-
figures and evidently this
year’s target-figures have had
to be still more severely cut.
Because of the shortage of
agricultural labor, the central
committee decided that the
production of steel by simple
backyard methods, of which
so much had been expected,
should no longer be included
in the State plan. The lower-
ing of sights means that the
Chinese now expect to take


10, instead of the two or three
years promised last autumn, to
catch-up with present British
output.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“The Chinese people will draw
their own conclusions from
this unexpected tenth-birthday
present. They know that if
375-million tons of grain had
in fact been produced no one
in their country would have
gone short, and their exports
would have been upsetting
prices all over Asia. Instead,
people have gone short, prob-
ably in millions.
“Yet we can be certain that
the gigantic economic effort
led by Mao Tse-tung will go
on. The five-year-plan target
remains unchanged; the main
figures of economic progress
are impressive; the dropping
of the absurd pretence that the
three-million tons of steel being
produced in the village are not
medieval in quality can do
nothing but good.
“There is no evidence that
political opposition to the
party was a major cause of
these errors. So we should do
well to mark the self-confidence
and realism of the Chinese
rather than the quaint and dis-
honest language in which error
is admitted.”
* * *
Manchester “ Guardian ”:
“Non - Communists should
derive no satisfaction from the
Chinese Communists’ failure
to achieve their goals last
year. It is deeply moving that
the Chinese people, having
suffered from the ‘inhumanity’
of the communes, are not get-
ting the reward of better
material living that was sup-
posed to result from their
efficiency. Nor are the leaders
likely to be any better behaved
towards the outside world
because of their domestic
disappointments.
“The great consolation is
that Indians, for all the
‘inefficiency’ of the democratic
institutions they want to main-
tain, need no longer fear that
they are slipping behind China
agriculturally and industrially.
There is no evidence that they
are ; there is no reliable evi-
dence at all. This has been a
bad year for the reputation of
Chinese Communism in Asia.”

“Yorkshire Post”: “Mr.
Khrushchev and ■ his Soviet
colleagues will have read
Peking’s admissions with mixed
feelings. It is true that Russia’s
criticisms of the Chinese ‘way
to Communism’ have been
thus vindicated, and therefore
while Peking’s prestige drops
Russia’s rises; but a hungry
China is a dangerous China.
Peking had already admitted
that a combination of drought
and flood had had disastrous
effects on the harvest this year
and that there would be famine
in some areas in the coming
winter. All in all, Moscow
may fear that the Chinese
leaders will undertake some
foreign adventure to divert

attention from hunger at
home.
“In present circumstances
that would by no means suit
Mr. Khrushchev’s book.”
New Ike?
President Eisenhower’s trip
to Europe to try to unite
Adenauer, Macmillan and de
Gaulle before his top-level
meetings with Khrushchev has
given rise to many articles in
the U.S. and U.K. press hail-
ing him as a new man. As the
Manchester “Guardian” put it,
“people who for years had
been writing-off Mr. Eisen-
hower as little more than a
benevolent King Log are now
making him out to be an
equally benevolent King Stork.
What is the truth of the
matter?”:
“Is it not more likely that
he is the man he always was,
but that conditions have
changed and have led him to
play a somewhat unfamiliar
part? The novelty in the Presi-
dent’s action is twofold. He
has taken a new initiative in
foreign policy; and he has
shown unaccustomed vigor in
his dealings with Congress.
The more obvious novelty is
Mr. Eisenhower’s decision to
hold talks with Mr. Khrushchev
after years during which the
Administration was at best
lukewarm about summit-meet-
ings. The disappearance of
Mr. Dulles, for long the chief
advocate of caution, may have
had something to do with this.
“With a new Secretary of
State who could not hope to
match Mr. Dulles’s authority,
the President has been drawn
into closer direction of foreign
policy. Yet there were signs
that Mr. Dulles before his
death was also feeling his way
towards a more flexible policy.
“The President’s talks with
Mr. Khrushchev should be
seen as part of a continuing
process which has, for instance,
suddenly made it fashionable
for Americans to visit Russia.
Six years ago such visits were
next-door to treason. Now
they are the latest craze. At a
deeper level they speak for a
growing realisation that in the
nuclear age America and Russia
may be in the same boat.
Rather than a commanding
lead to public opinion the
President’s move is a reflection
of it.
“It is President Eisenhower’s
conduct at home that has done
most to set-off the wave of
reports about his new-found
strength. Surprise at his vigor
has been all the greater because
everyone expected that as a
‘lame duck’ President, bound
to go out in 18 months’ time
and faced with a large Demo-
cratic majority in Congress, he
would have a hard time of it.
Those who thought him weak
expected him to grow weaker
still.
“Possibly this very expecta-
tion has spurred - on the
President, just as the uni-
versal expectation that he
would not run again after
his illnesses in 1955-56
may have spurred him to
do just that. And just because

Soviet Never-never
T ondon “Economist” com-
ment on the introduction
of hire-purchase into the
Soviet Union:
“The buyer will have to pay
between a fifth and a quarter
cash and the rest in six to 12
monthly instalments. The rate
of interest will vary from one
to two per cent.
“What has decided the Rus-
sians finally to adopt a method
which for years they had
abused? The suggestion that
they have been forced to it by
consumer-resistance, and that
this is merely a scheme to get
rid of unwanted goods, cannot
be taken seriously. Soviet
planners fix the prices ; a price-
reduction would have been a
more logical step. On occa-
sions sales have also been
authorised when shoddy or
unwanted goods had piled-up.
Besides, the list of items that
can now be sold on h.-p.
disproves the theory. Radio-
grams, better-quality wireless-
sets, cameras, motor-cycles,
sewing-machines or watches
are not goods for which
demand is lacking.
“The explanation seems to
be that the Soviet Union is
now beginning to produce on
a mass scale certain durable
goods too expensive for
workers to buy at once. The
six or 12 instalments and the
low interest-rate (however un-
orthodox) should help. For
a few years now Russian town-
dwellers have been able to hire
goods ranging from an
accordion to a sewing-machine.
The addition of hire-purchase
forms part of the trend
towards mass consumption.”

Moves have been made at the national level
for the development of Australia’s underground
water resources. That can be hailed as a sign of
sound forward-thinking.
It is one of the measureless blessings of this
country that artesian water lies below an area of
912,000 square miles of the continent —more than
half a million square miles of it in one Great Basin
underlying parts of Queensland, New South Wales,
South Australia and the Northern Territory.
Any, combined Government action to prevent
waste from the bores and conserve this precious
flow will be good and prudent.
However, there is much more than this to be
done in imaginatively striving to unlock the wealth
of the inland with water’s key. And what we do
in that way need not be bounded by conventional
ideas of the past.
More than twenty years have passed since
the late Dr. J. J. C. Bradfield put forward
his scheme for impounding water from
seasonally-flooded North Queensland rivers and
tunnelling it through the Great Dividing Range to
streams flowing south-west through vast sheep and
cattle lands.
Because of engineering and financial problems
involved at the time, the plan was rejected. But
in the light of modern experience we may regard
Dr. Bradfield as not the author of a fantasy but as
a genius ahead of his time.
The Snowy Mountains Scheme has since
proved the principle. It is turning water back
inland for irrigation and hydro-electric power. In
its amazing system of tunnelling it has set the
standard in constructional performance.
In Dr. Bradfield’s idea was that element of
original thinking which we will have to employ
in facing the long challenge of our country’s future.
That is its present merit.
Even though his plan now might be considered
subject to revision in detail, events have proved
it more than possible. And when, in time, the
ranges are pierced to provide more in surface water
for the interior, Australia will have cause to be
thankful for the faith that inspired Dr. Bradfield.
on their city’s name by Mr.
Faubus, the Governor of
Arkansas, two years ago”:
“This does not mean, how-
ever, that the white citizens of
Little Rock have become con-
vinced believers in racial inte-
gration. The great majority of
them still hold that Negro and
white pupils should be taught
separately. But, in addition to
resenting last year’s interrup-
tion in their children’s educa-
tion, they are proud of their
city’s reputation as one of the
most progressive in the South
and have been distressed at the
world-wide shame brought
upon it. They have also been
distressed at the check to its
prosperity and economic ex-
pansion which has followed its
much-publicised troubles.
Finally, they disliked inter-
ference from the State authori-
ties with the essentially local
affair of public education.
“All this has combined to
ensure that this year two of
Little Rock’s four high-schools
will have four or five Negro
pupils among their 2000-or-
more white ones ; the other two
high-schools are still com-
pletely segregated—one Negro,
one white. This is the very
minimum token of integration
and is far from satisfying
Negro leaders or other up-
holders of the Supreme Court’s
decision, however relieved they
may be that compliance has
replaced defiance in Little
Rock.”
Dragnet Digest
Walter Lippmann, in N.Y.
“Herald Tribune”: “Not only
is there no pressing and urgent
need on either side for a settle-
ment of the cold war in Europe,
there is also on both sides, but
lor separate and complicated
reasons, a desire to avoid a
showdown and to play for
time. The U.S.S.R. says openly
and frequently that it wants
seven to 10 years of peace and
a relief of tension in order to
carry-out its programme of
economic development. There
is no good reason to doubt
that this is true.
“The West also has its
reasons for avoiding a show-
down and playing for time.
Showdowns are not only nerve-
racking in themselves, but no-
body can be quite sure what
a showdown would show.
There are other reasons why
the West wants time—to catch-
up in the race of armaments,
to promote the booming
economy of the Western world,
to work its way through the
transitional period—which is
the present —between the old
colonial system and the new
independent States of Asia
and Africa.”

Merle Fainsod, in “Problems
of Communism” : “Those who
accept Khrushchev’s assurance
that collective leadership still
prevails in the Soviet Union
may point to the undoubted
fact that the party Central Com-
mittee assembles with con-
siderable frequency and that
local party organisations func-
tion with greater regularity
than was true during the latter
part of Stalin’s reign. But it
may be worth remembering
that Stalin at one time was
also lavish in his praise of col-
lective leadership and that he,
too, made effective use of the
Central Committee in his march
to supreme power. Khrush-
chev’s style of governance has
its own distinctive charac-
teristics, but the swiftness with
which he has moved to consoli-
date his authority leaves little
doubt that he is now, not
merely primus inter pares, but
the new master of the Soviet
State,”

London “Observer”: “It is
understandable that when the
Big Two talk alone un-
encumbered by ‘alliance
diplomacy,’ some of their allies
should feel demoted or
anxious: but that does not
make such feelings rational or
justified. The partial dropping
of alliance diplomacy does not
mean the end of the alliance:
it means adapting it to new
needs. We must make Nato
fit the facts of a changing
situation, not try to make the
facts fit Nato.”

Mr. Lester Pearson: “We,

cause we have a car in every

Vice-President Nixon : “Co-

which they want, but where
there is free communication

fuss that he was given per-
mission to keep the bull iso-
lated on his farm for 60 days,
after which he could have his
own veterinary - practitioner
test it.
The 60-day lapse was neces-
sary because if one test is fol-
lowed too closely by another,
it is sometimes found that the
first test desensitises the animal
and it will not react. After
60 days it will again give a
true test.
When the time had elapsed
the farmer called - in his
veterinarian. The bull was
injected and the farmer waited
with confidence for the test to
be read. The private vet.
wouldn’t want to steal his
valuable bull from him as the
Government did. He hung
over the veterinarian’s shoulder
while the test was read, ready
to gloat.
“He’s a reactor,” said the
vet.
The farmer threw his hands
to heaven and swore heartily.
“But he can’t be! I know
the bull can’t be!”
“But he is. You can see the
swelling yourself.”
“I tell you you’re wrong.
He can’t be a reactor!”
“Why can’t he be?”
“Why can’t he be! Why
can’t he be! I paid four-
hundred and fifty pounds for
him, that’s why!”
The farmer was wild with
anger. No one who had any-
thing to do with T.8.-testing
had any brains. Any brains
at all! He pulled his cheque-
book from his pocket and dis-
played the butt for four-
hundred and fifty pounds.
“Now,” he asked in triumph,
“do you still think he has
T. 8.?”
The Doubting Thomases are
gone and the shotgun and the
pitchfork with them. The
occupational hazards that are
left are nervous heifers, bulls
and rotten rails that give way
when the vet. is climbing into
and over bails and crushes.
For me, the recorder and the
passenger in the car, the
greatest hazards were the
farmers’ gates.
'T'ravelling from farm to
farm, I came to the conclu-
sion that gates were necessary
but, as a passenger and gate-
opener, that stock-crossings
were preferable.
The stock-crossing is a series
of half-a-dozen or so wooden
or metal rails laid down in
an opening in a fence. The
wonderful thing about them is
they allow a car through, but
for some reason four-footed
animals will not walk on them,
and so the stock-crossing
keeps the animals in without
the passenger having to open
a gate.
“Why doesn’t every farmer
have these beautiful contrap-
tions?” I asked Rocky.
“Should be simpler to install
than a gate. Why aren’t they
more popular?”
“Must have a gate, too,” he
“Get your airborne troops into position before
Gunsioell attacks with his heavy armor.”
explained. “Otherwise there’d
be no way of getting in and
out with a team of horses
or to move cattle.”
It is not due to lack of
gallantry on Rocky’s part that
I opened gates. The rules are:
“Leave gates as you find them,”
and “Passengers open gates.”
And the rules are reasonable.
The gate that opens easily,
swings back on its own
momentum to allow a car
through, and then can be shut
and fastened with fingertip
control, is so rare that I
became delirious with happi-
ness when I found one. A
gate that is perfectly satisfac-
tory when first installed is
quickly converted into a devil
after a few rains, when posts
settle so that the original fas-
teners can’t be used, and weight
and time spring the hinges and
allow the frame to sag so that
it must be lifted before it can
be opened.
Every gate was a challenge.
Would it have a latch that
took a graduate in engineer-
ing to fathom how it worked?
Would it have a bolt wedged
into a post that took all my
strength to pull out? Would
it be fastened with a wooden
stick that left my fingers full
of splinters? Or would it
have a catch that pinched my
fingers and knocked-off my
finger-nails?
The most ingenious of these
latches I christened the
Jumpin’ Jehosophat. It was
simply a piece of wire fas-
tened to a stick and worked
on a lever system, the devil
only knew how. And I’m sure
he was as startled as I, when
I finally pushed or pulled
something and gate, latch and
all flew at me.
After the latch was mastered,
there was the problem of
opening the gate. Had the
hinges sprung so that I had
to drag it the whole distance?
Or would the hinges allow it
to swing freely for half the
distance and then let it down
so that it hit the ground with
force enough to swing back
and catch me on the shins as
I started to walk through?
Or when I prepared to drag
it the rest of the way open,
would it suddenly swing free
and chase me? I found it
possible to tell the disposition
of a gate by the expression
on its face.
The gate that was split in
the centre and had two sets
of hinges was usually a merry
gate. When the catch was
freed, both sides swung open,
but not far enough to allow
a car through. I would give
one half a push, then do the
same to the other half, only
to find the first half had swung
back again. After several
attempts I would end-up prop-
ping a side open with clods of
dirt or stones, without having
entered into the merriment at
all. In the meantime, Rocky
had been enjoying the scenery
and offering advice from the
driver’s seat. This merry
maniac did little to cement
husband-wife relationship.
And then there was the
Frankenstein gate. This
monster of a gate was merely
a panel of barbed-wire fencing
that had been cut and the
free end fastened to a mov-
able pole. The pole was held
in place by a loop of wire
at the bottom of the post, and
a removable loop of wire at
the top. When the loop at the
top was released, anything
could happen, depending upon
the amount of tension on the
barbed-wire. If the tension
was great, and it usually was,
the gate sprang at me like a
startled leopard and took bits
off me and my clothes as it
flashed past.
When we arrived at the
Frankenstein Gate Rocky,
who does have a strong sense
of gallantry, would say “I’ll
take this one.”
In the beginning I stub-
bornly maintained I could
open any gate he could. That
I was brought-up on a farm
and barbed-wire held no
terrors for me. I was his help-
mate, wasn’t I? Then I would
help. But, in fact, my child-
hood memories of barbed-
wire were not affectionate
ones, and the self-inflected
refesher-course did nothing
to make its actuality more
pleasing; and soon found I
could be*, as helpless as the
most clinging of vines. I
didn’t cling too tightly; I
merely moved into the driver’s
seat and stayed there.
"Dloody Mary’s had no
gates. They would have
been a plague to-her, for she
owned fifty head of cattle and
roughly two acres of land.
This disparity of land to
stock made it unavoidable

road), or on the surrounding

hills, which didn’t belong to
her. It was therefore neces-
sary, so Mary thought, to equip
each cow with a bell. And
there was no need spending
money on tinkly chimy ones
when she could easily make
them herself.
A tin the rat-bait or the
peaches came in, and an old
nut or bolt picked-up any-
where in her yard—then with
a bit of wire and a hole
punched in the unopened end
she had a bell—discordant,
but a bell. And if you had
a bell on a cow you knew
where she was, whether she
was in her proper long paddock
or if she’d escaped to the hills.
When Mary’s cattle were
yarded there was a cacophony
like a boiler-factory warming-
up.
Bloody Mary was a tall,
angular woman with the
weather-worn appearance of
the hills surrounding her.
Hills that had for centuries
been baked by the sun and
eroded by the rains. She wore
a dress, for I caught a fleet-
ing glimpse of a quite clean
one when it peeped out from
the corn-bags she had draped
about Tier—fore, aft and
shoulderwise. The bags were
decorated with milk - stain
motifs—and not necessarily
freshly applied, as my nose
told me if I happened to be
down-wind from her. Why
she wore a dress at all was
the question. The corn-bags
amply protected her from any
accusation of indecent
exposure.
Mary spoke only broken
English, I at first decided,
from what I could hear over
the bells, bells, bells; but
later it turned out she used
a native but involved and
profanated version of the
language.
The earthy quality in Mary
expressed itself in her speech
—it was down-to-earth, too.
Her one-name-for-all-of-’em
was the term usually reserved
for female dogs, and this term
was modified or embellished
with the great Australian
adjective, handed down by
British ancestors —“bloody.”
“Head the b bitch into
the b bails!” she would
scream to a small boy who
was helping her, and her
piercing scream drowned the
jangle and dong of the bells
and was heard a second later
bounding back in echo from
the hills.
The boy would dutifully
head the b bitch into the
bail. Whether he used Mary’s
language in imitation or
because it was the only
language the cows understood,
I don’t know.
Mary’s adjective not only
supported each noun, but split
asunder and hyphenated any
two or three syllable words
that could be adapted to it.
The use of the adjective in this
form distinguishes the casual
from the constant Australian
swearer, the amateur from the
master. And Mary was no
amateur.
“Kick the b bitch in the
back —b —sides,” Mary would
yell. “She’s the biggest b
bitch in Queens —b —land.”
Mary’s tongue flashed like
lightning and cleft the air,
leaving a smell of ozone in
its wake. But her actions
were as harmless as thunder.
I think she loved her cows, and
was God-fearing, too, and her
profanity merely a conversa-
tional habit.
True, Pink Lady was dead,
but that day, even her memory
was completely obscured by
a smoke haze, and my gallant
Prince Charming stood by and
his ears burned.
He turned to me and
shrugged. “If I ask Mary to
tone-down her language she
won’t be able to speak at all.
You’d better go to the car.”
“What’s the use? I could
still hear her and I don’t want
to miss any of this. It’s
educational.”
“Stick around then if you
must. If it’s education you
want, a little tuition from
Mary and you’ll be ready for
a doctorate in profanity.”
As I have said, gates tried
my soul ; but the one day
a gate did swing freely lives
as a vivid flash.
The gate was directly behind
some cowbails. Rocky had
tested a cow named Nellie and
stepped back to encourage her
to leave the bails. His foot
slipped in a gutter and he lost
balance. He flung his hands
back to save himself by clutch-
ing the gate, which quietly
swung open, Rocky with it.
He landed rather gently on the
flat of his back.
Nellie then found she was
no longer confined and hur-
riedly backed out of the bail.
The gutter Rocky had slipped
in had been there for years
and Nellie had always man-
aged it, but that day, in her
haste, her back feet skidded
and she sat down on Rocky—
not rather gently. She seemed
pleased that her fall had been
cushioned and wriggled her
haunches in appreciation
before she turned her head
in an inquisitive manner and
gazed directly into Rocky’s
eyes.
He was offended by the
indignity of his situation and
told her so.
Poor Nellie! I suspect the
experience curdled her milk
and left her emotionally un-
stable. Rocky was unharmed
outside of a few pressure-spots
and he’d forgotten them by
the time we were on the way
home.
We had shut the last gate
and were on the highway.
The last gate was an especially
trying one and I said nastily:
“You can tell what kind of
a farmer you’ll find by the
state of his gate.”
Rocky was not listening
much. He nodded his head.
“It wouldn’t take long to
make a decent gate and put
the crush in repair and the
bails.”
Rocky was looking at the
landscape. “Might be some
wild ducks on that dam over
there.”
“Could be working at things
like that at odd times or on
rainy days,” I continued.
Rocky decided he would
bring his gun out one day.
The dam had definite possi-
bilities for there was a wild
duck swimming on it.
And then we arrived home.
Our gate opens in the middle.
It sags on its hinges a little —
only a little —and swings shut
if it isn’t hooked back. Rocky
looked at it, tipped his hat
back and scratched his head.
“Must do something about
that gate.”
“And there are some loose
boards on the front steps.”
He winked at me. “Some
odd time or a rainy day, I’ll
fix them.”
I was home. I had mellowed
a bit—but only a bit.
“You won’t want to go out
in the rain to fix them. It
will have to be some odd
time,” I said.
And it will be, too.
Dead House in the Hills
The lilt in the sun,
and wind’s caress,
the bright birds
and the chattering grass,
and the long trees
at the precipice
are a green shield
to this farm’s distress,
to these bleached rooms’
hint of loneliness.
Never believe there was any-
one here
ever should have acknowledged
distress or despair—
see, this road is picturebook,
picnic and air.
Then say it was fire, or a very
bad year . . .
Time’s in the sun,
the fanged wind’s caress.
The birds screech
to the thorns in the grass,
and the trees long
at the precipice.
And nothing shields
man’s whole distress,
his bleached heart
and his loneliness.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Teenage Independence
A teenager brightly com-
plained on a Sydney TV teen-
age session the other evening
that because most youths
dressed much like bodgies
many adults automatically
accused them of behaving like
bodgies. This undoubtedly is
true.
I have a near-15-year-old
whose tastes in clothes are
almost as irregular as mine are
conservative, but whose general
behavior, both at home and
abroad, happily leaves no real
cause for complaint. At the
same time, this lad’s ideas on
what his mother should or
should not wear admit no
extremity or nonsense. Tak-
ing the trouble to listen to
him in his rare communicative
moods, I have come to appre-
ciate some of the notions
activating his class.
Teenagers today have
achieved for themselves a
status never previously enjoyed
by their group in that their
opinions at least receive the
serious consideration of their
elders.
In the matter of the group's
rather exotic flair for dress, I
have been slowly converted to
the view that we oldsters
should be less old-fashioned
and more ' tolerant to the
changes in some time-worn
traditions and conventions
which teenagers by no other
means but passive resistance
seem collectively set upon
bringing about.
After all, the world is theirs
to inherit; ours only to
bequeath. They could be right
in wanting to alter some of
the minor, if not the major,
designs for living. —P. O. M. C.
(N.S.W.).
Grants on Old Homes
New housing-legislation in
the U.K. that will benefit
people wishing to buy and
modernise older-type houses
would be worth copying in
Australia.
The new Act provides that
anyone wanting to buy a pre-
-1919 house worth no more
than £3OOO in London or
£2500 elsewhere in the U.K.
can get a mortgage of up to
95 per cent, from a building-
society. It also makes avail-
able to all owners valuable
grants towards the cost of
putting five standard improve-
ments into houses lacking
them. Improvements include
a hot-water supply and a food-
store. The grants can be
obtained provided there is 15
years’ life left in the house,
and provided applicants own
the freehold or have a lease
with not more than 15 years
to run.
In Australia, houses built
more than a decade ago can-
not be bought through finance
“ Low-slung, yes; but if the garage-door 's closed just
duck your head and drive under.”
by bank or building-society,
though ex-servicemen can use
War Service Homes finance to
buy them. Many people who
would prefer an older-type
home in a developed suburb
are obliged to go into new
houses in outer suburbs. The
big-city spread is thus accentu-
ated, and long-established
residential suburbs ' fully
equipped with schools, water
and sewerage, shopping-facili-
ties, etc., have declining popu-
lations.
These facilities have to be
provided at high cost in the
new suburbs. Older houses in
established suburbs, even when
in admirable condition, are
often hard to sell unless the
owner is prepared to make a
sacrifice. — Morris the Tinker
(N.S.W.).
Vagging the Work-seeker
Ration-cards once used to be
issued by Queensland country
police to all work-seekers
waltzing matilda in the bush.
During the depression days this
became quite a sideline to
police-work in all States, and
in that way the workless
managed to keep body and
trousers together while con-
tinuing their search for work.
In the modern Welfare State,
however, the moneyless work-
seeker in the bush, when accom-
panied by matilda, is liable to
get run-in on a vag. charge,
because the dole can be drawn
only after a three-weeks resi-
dential qualification. So the
lad in search of work is hamp-
ered unless he can manage to
present a Rothschild-front on
an empty belly for three weeks.
It seems a rather complicated
way of saying that if the
worker becomes workless where
he is, then he’d better stay put
unless he is prepared for a
severe endurance-test or has a
good line of patter to produce
visible means of support.—

wonders (B. 26/8 /’59) whether
it is worth all the expense air-
lines go to to save a few hours’,
or even a few days’, flying-
time between here and Britain
or the U.S. —ever sat in a
Stratocruiser while, against
North Atlantic winter wester-
lies, it took 18 hours in dark-
ness to lumber from London

Connie to go non-stop from

Has he ever had Salt Lake

roundings” became 10y hours

there is nothing so boring as
long stretches in the air. Any-
thing that will fit an average

MSS. to U.S.A.
Early this year I sent the
400-page manuscript of a
novel to the U.S. It certainly
arrived in New York, but then
went missing in the post and
can’t be traced. Later I dis-
covered that a number of Aus-
tralian writers have had a
similar experience with MSS.
in the U.S. mails.
A letter on the subject to
a friend in California has
brought this reply:
The way in which manuscripts
go missing here is quite a scandal.
We haven’t been able to prove
anything, but there appears to be
a market in stolen ones. The
sharks who buy them must go
through them in a search for
original ideas.
If any such idea is found, it is
copied and the rest of the
manuscript is burnt. If nothing
worth stealing comes to light, the
script is burnt just the same. Most
of those which go missing come
from overseas, the thieves being
aware that complaints about loss
of articles posted from another
country will either fail to reach the
proper quarter or will be lost in
a maze of red-tape.
A further complication,
which every working writer
encounters sooner or later, is
the extreme difficulty in prov-
ing that there has been a
theft of ideas when they have
been taken from an unpub-
lished MS.
The only advice my Cali-
fornian friend could give in
regard to manuscripts sent to
the U.S. is to send a copy to
the Writers’ Guild of America,
with a fee for registration;
but he warned that this gives
no protection to ideas —and

Concerning Ladies’ Ages
What an absurd action was
that of Sir William Leggatt,
Agent-General for Victoria, in
writing to a London newspaper
seeking information about the
birth-date of Dame Nellie
Melba! As well expect the
British High Commissioner in
Australia to implore local
assistance concerning, say,
Gilbert and Sullivan.
It should have been obvious
that the supposed problem
could have been solved by
dropping a note to the Regis-
trar of Births in Leggatt’s (and
Melba’s) own State, or to the
Melbourne Public Library, or
even to Melba's relatives.
More simply, the A.-G. could
have got what he wanted by
consulting his country’s two
chief works of biographical
reference, Serle’s Dictionary
and The Australian Encyclo-
paedia.
Melba was born on May 19,
1861. That fact has been
public property for more than
30 years. It was published in
the first edition of the A.E.
(1926) by the head of Angus
and Robertson, who, inciden-
tally, was quite pleased with
himself for having cleared-up
the then existing doubt on the
point.
“I’ve got Melba’s birth-date
—official,” Robertson told me.
And, chuckling in his beard,
he added that he thought works
of reference were obliged to
include information of the
kind, and he hoped that Melba
(then still alive) wouldn’t mind
very much.
Following its joust with the
“puzzle” regarding Melba, one
of Sydney’s newspapers has
discovered another “mystery”
of the same nature, with Daisy
Bates as the subject. Here
again there’s a spot of air-
beating going on.
Mrs. Bates was born in the
same year as Melba. I know
that because she herself told
me so when I was editing
Who’s Who in Australia; and
the date duly appeared in that
work in 1947 —a fact which
shatters , a claim by the latest
prober that Who’s Who has
been “unhelpful” in this
matter.
Maybe the next attack on
the “mystery” of a feminine
birth-date will relate to Nellie
Stewart. Through some mis-
chance, the A.E. of 1926 gave
her year of advent as 1864
(which made her three years
younger than the other Nellie),
but in both Serle and the new
A.E. it has been set back six
years—to November 20, 1858.
The correct date was dis-
covered, in fact, soon after the
wrong one was published, and,
as the birthday was then due,
a Sydney “Daily Telegraph”
gossip-writer ran a par. on the
subject. That note was quite
cordial, but it failed entirely to
appeal to “Sweet Nell.”
She stormed into the office,
demanded to see the chief-of-
staff, and handed me a highly
competent dressing - down,
based on the idea that she had
been “held-up to ridicule.”
“Tut-tut, Miss Stewart,” I
protested. “There wasn’t the
slightest suggestion of ridicule.
We were tendering you con-
gratulations on behalf of your
army of admirers.”
Nell was not appeased.
“Now,” she proclaimed, “as I
go along the street people will
turn and say”—her voice rose
theatrically—“ ‘Look at that
poor old woman.’ ”
Nellie Melba and Nellie
Stewart both died, within a
few months of each other, in
1931. Daisy Bates outlived
them by 20 years—a remark-
able achievement on the part
of a wisp of a woman who had
spent much of her life in rough
spots.
But, in fact, the aborigines’
“Kabbarli” was sprightly
almost to the end. In 1945,
when she called on the Duke
and Duchess of Gloucester at
Adelaide, she asked a pipe-
major to play a certain melody
known to her in youth, and


when he did so the quaint,
long-skirted veteran of 84
grabbed young Prince William
and danced him about the
lounge.
Daisy Bates, you will gather,
did not share Nell Stewart’s
complex. It probably never
occurred to her, at any time,
That people might say: “Look
at that poor old woman.” Nor
would she have cared if they
had. — Alec H. Chisholm
(N.S.W.).
Victorian Teachers
Your “Plain English” attack
on holidays enjoyed by Vic-
torian schoolteachers (B.
26/8/’59) is unfair.
The question of school-holi-
days was no part of “teachers’
propaganda” for Education
Week. This issue has been on
the agenda ever since an article
in the “Victorian Teachers’
Journal” last April pointed out
that Victorian State school-
teachers get far fewer holidays
than any other teachers in Aus-
tralia, and possibly in the Eng-
lish-speaking world. Victorian
teachers get 64 days a year.
N.S.W. teachers get 75, New
Zealand teachers 94, and
teachers in most private schools
98.
Furthermore, teachers have
stressed all along that children
need the holidays as much as
teachers. School - kids have
never been under such strain
as they are today. The length
of their working-day and the
way it’s broken into 40-minute
periods which demand an
abrupt change of subject and a
new burst of concentration
would send their elders home
to a stiff whisky and bed.
Most parents agree (and a
number have said so in the
press) that school-children to-
day have to work harder and
cover more ground than ever
before and, if they were older
and wideawake to adult
stratagems, would be justified
in demanding sedatives and
time off for “nervous strain.”
Selfish adults who don’t look
hard enough can’t see this.
Teachers, too, are worn to
a frazzle by the end of the
term. One teacher I know has
worked 12 hours a day for the
last three months, seldom
putting aside her exercise-books
until 11.30 p.m. She now
gets a wonderful break of six
working-days. But as the in-
spectors arrive on her first day
back at school she will spend
most of her holiday preparing
demonstration - lessons and
reports on her previous work.
Incidentally, the Victorian
Teachers’ Union does not
claim that it is “the fault of
the parents and the children”
that they leave school too early.
The union says that it’s due to
inadequate investment in edu-
cation and inadequate compre-
hension by the authorities of
the need for better-educated
citizens. Most teachers are well
aware of the disadvantages of
exams, and the need to “edu-
cate for life.” —Fossicker

Writers of Queensland
Cecil Hadgraft’s survey of
“Writers of Queensland” (B.
26 / 8 / ’59) surprisingly made no
reference to three good authors
connected with the Banana
State—E. J. Banfield, Jack
Maclaren and Albert Dor-
rington.
Banfield’s delightful books
about his life on Dunk Island
won him readers far beyond
Australia, even in his lifetime.
Jack Maclaren’s My

Pharmacies
When I drifted along he was
standing on the footpath in
front of his shop (beg pardon
—pharmacy) surveying the
result of his morning’s work.
“What do you think of it?”
he asked, nodding at the newly-
dressed window.
We’re old friends, so I told
him. I said that I preferred the
old style of set-up for a
pharmacy something that
looked a little more dignified
and professional and less like
a chain-store.
I’m not suggesting that the
pharmacist should take-up
quarters in a cave, wear the
high - peaked hat of the
alchemist, and surround him-
self with vipers, toads and
spider-webs ; but I do suggest
that his shop would be more in
keeping with his profession had
it not departed from the tradi-
tional window-dressing of two
carboys filled with green and
red water flanking a large jar
labelled “leeches.”
Banks seem to vie with each
other in making their branches
look more like conservatories,
milk-bars or aquariums than
anything connected with the
serious business of money;
and likewise the pharmacist
tries to make his shop look
something like a bargain-
basement at Christmas. Attrac-
tively packaged proprietary
lines, plastic toys, sporting-
goods, cameras —even cigarettes
and tobacco—have jostled the
dispensing department into a
corner, seeming to suggest that
dispensing is now just a side-
line. Gone is the fragrance of
aromatic herbs —the aura is
now that of the beauty-parlor.
Gone also is the old fishtailed
gas-burner and the stick of
sealing-wax. Adhesive tape is
so much easier.
As my friend remarked, he
is trained for what should be
a professional life and spends
most of it as a retailer of odd-
ments. To a man trained at a
pharmacy-college or university
it must be somewhat galling to
find that most of his time is
spent selling lipsticks to flappers
or helping Mother to decide
whether she’d like a red or
yellow plastic horse for
Junior.
So far, Australian chemists
don’t seem to have quite come
round to the Yankee idea of
drug-store - cum - soda-fountain
(complete with jer.k), but no
doubt it won’t be long before we
have to jostle our way in
through beatniks, bodgies and
widgies gargling chocolate-
sodas in between rock-’n’-roll-
ing to a gaily-colored jukebox.
When things reach that stage I
will buy my packet of Epsom-
salts from the grocer. I will
probably need it. — Ceg (Vic.).
The Wyndham Report
“Sir” seems to take a
rather pessimistic view of the
Wyndham Report (B. 2/9/’59).
When I wrote of pupils
taking “an elective subject of
FERNANDO WINES
their choice,” I had in mind
this statement in the report:
In addition to the common
curriculum, we propose that pupils
will select, under the guidance of
the principal, other courses
(“electives”) in accordance with
their ability, aptitudes and interests.
This clearly gives the right
of selection to the pupil. Of
course the pupil’s selection will
be restricted by the courses
available in his school. The
report recognises this. It also
lists at least 18 subjects, “most
or all of which a comprehen-
sive secondary-school might
be expected to provide.”
Incidentally, this list includes
a few subjects—e.g., botany
and geology— not at present
provided ; but it omits a few
other s —e.g., economics—
which are taught in typical
country high-schools.
Undoubtedly the facilities
available and the principal’s
“guidance” will play a part;
but if, as “Sir” says, “the judge
will be the headmaster” —
implying that the pupil will
have no choice —the scheme
will not be the one recom-
mended in the report.
“Sir” has had an unfortu-
nate experience with his pupils
if he thinks “no pupil is a
good judge of his own
aptitude.” A pupil aged 14
or over, having spent four
years in the primary-school
and a year on the seven sub-
jects in the “common core”
in first-year, will know his
strong and weak subjects even
better than he does at present;
and if he has any doubts his
examination-marks and posi-
tion in class in each subject
will enlighten him.
Parents admittedly have a
rather inflated notion of their
youngsters’ talents; but the
marks, etc., at the end of first-
year should enlighten them,
too. This, of course, is one
of the reasons for the
“transition” first-year —it is
“exploratory.”
“Sir” is again wrong in
regarding the present system
(in N.S.W.) as “simply a means
of getting pupils through cer-
tain public examinations.”
Less than half our secondary
pupils ever sit for a
public examination. —A. J. W.
(N.S.W.).
The Service Pension
It is evident that “Kelms”
(B. 26/8/’59) and “Gaba
Tepe” (B. 5/8/’59) are talking
at cross-purposes. “Kelms”
says he has “been drawing a
service-pension since 1945,”
but his explanation makes it
clear he’s getting a war-
pension— not the same at all.
He’s getting a pension based on
an accepted war-disability, and
it will increase if the disability
worsens.
A service - pension, also
called the Diggers’ pension, or
the “burnt - out” pension
(wrongly, of course, because
you don’t have to have a medi-
cal examination to get it), is
just the age-pension, with the
same means-test and worth
only as much.
Any man who served in a
war-area in the Australian
armed forces can ask for the
service-pension when he’s 60:
he doesn’t have to wait until
he’s 65.
Every year the service-
pension holder has to fill-in a
form with details of his
financial position—in case rich
Uncle Bob from Fiji should
that year have left him so
much money as to disqualify
him for the pension. There’s
no means-test for a war-
pension based on a war-
disability.
A Digger aged between 60
and 65 with a wife of 60 or
older can get £9 10s. a week
between them if their assets
aren’t too great, and they are
permitted to earn between
them another £350 a year. If
the Digger gets a war-pension
less than that figure he can
get the service-pension on top
of it, plus the age-pension for
a wife over 60.
Huge numbers of War I
Diggers are between 60 and
65, and many are ready,
through the stresses of life —
not through war-disabilities —
to call it a day. They should
acquaint themselves with the
service-pension. Sergeant-

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
BEEF EXPORTS
By E. S. PLAYFAIR
T\uring the past year the
beef-industry has seen
many variations, particularly
in demand and prices. There
have been fluctuations in over-
seas prices, not only in the
U.K. but also in the boneless-
beef trade with the U.S.A.
At the'beginning of the year
very keen inquiries were
received from the United
Kingdom, but at prices which
were not attractive to Austra-
lian exporters. The demand
then ceased rather abruptly
for early arrivals in England,
and so at that time the out-
look was quite disturbing.
The release of certain grades
of meat from the U.K. fifteen-
year contract, enabling ship-
ments to other- parts of the
world, apparently caused con-
cern to some U.K. operators
about the future, and, without
any apparent reason, anxious
inquiries were instituted from
Production of raw wool
over all Communist
countries is estimated
to have increased by
75% between 1950 and
1958. These increases
in the Soviet .Union
and China were due
almost entirely to a
rise in sheep popula-
tion, but in most other
countries improved
average fleece weight
played a major part.
Australian graziers
know that every lamb
saved means increased
wool production—that’s
why successful graziers
use and recommend the
Elastrator method for
all Castrating and
Tailing. The risks of
disease and fly-borne
infections are consider-
ably lessened with the

England. These resulted in
strong activity at greatly
increased prices ; in fact, some
boneless cuts improved by as
much as a pound over
a period of four or five
months, whilst quarter-beef
rose by 34d. a pound sterling.
Withdrawal of the bounty no
doubt was the cause; it
unsettled the market.
About this time, the U.S.A.
trade came into full swing,
and sales were apparently
limited only by the lack of
shipping-space between the
two countries. American
activity added great impetus
to the trade here because
before this new demand the
type of meat that the U.S. was
seeking was not handled in
any quantity by local packers.
The U.S. importers, however,
were able to place this type
of meat, some for specified
cuts, into varying parts of the
trade, which enabled our
exporters to benefit accord-
ingly. The cost of producing
such packs was much greater
than for local requirements,
owing to the new and very
exacting preparations.
The demand from America
did not actually interfere with
supplies available to the U.K.
market except, maybe, where
some operators were unable
to extend their area of opera-
tion, whereas others have been
able to extend and are now
enjoying greater throughput
than previously.
The market in the U.S., like
that in the U.K., has shown
acute fluctuations, and is one
that must be closely watched,
mainly because the special-
ised cuts and trim the meat
is subjected to greatly increase
cost of production, but are not
acceptable elsewhere.
The U.S.A. trade has natur-
ally affected Australian
markets, and has been respon-
sible for the increased cost of
inferior grades of meat; good-
quality meat, on the other
hand, has only suffered
seasonal fluctuations. The
quantity exported, however,
has had a bearing on stock-
markets and created a higher
level of prices. This is to the
good of many, and particularly
to the producers, most of
whom have been suffering
from drought and from the
recession in wool prices. The
meat-trade has enjoyed full
employment for most of the
period, whilst Australia has
benefited very greatly from
increased dollar-earnings.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(3/9/’S9)
Queensland should have good rains during October,
with best falls on the south-coastal districts and around
Maranoa and part of the Warrego. Rainfall may be light on
the Peninsula and in the north-western districts, although
good rains should extend into portion of the far south-
western areas.
N.S.W. may expect moderate general rains during
October, although rainfall may be light on part of the
Central Coast. Heavy rains and widespread flooding may be
experienced in November, with good follow-on rains in
December.
Victoria should receive good general rains during
October, with heaviest falls and some flooding in the central
division. Heavy rains and widespread flooding are likely
in November.
Good general rains are indicated in the whole of South
Australia during October, and reasonably good rains should
continue in November.
Good rains should be received in the agricultural areas
of Western Australia, around Eucla and in the south-eastern
districts, with heavy falls in the north-eastern districts.
Rainfall poor elsewhere.
LENNOX WALKER
HIDES
By ARTHUR R. BRIEN
Tt is generally accepted that
■*- hides from beef-breeds of
cattle make the best leather,
although those from steers and
heifers of milking strains come
well to the fore for light-
leather users.
Many tanners prefer Here-
fords because of their sub-
stance ; though, in recent
years—perhaps from more
careful breeding—these cattle
have produced a hide which
is often ribby from the neck
to the shoulder. Where this
occurs, it is impossible to
remove this condition during
treatment and finishing of the
leather.
Other beef-breeds differ
very little, if reared under
similar conditions. ’ Cattle
of every breed coming from
the far west, if pastured in a
similar way, do not produce
a hide equal on average to
those grown in cooler areas
and are generally more
spready.
To produce good leather, the
hide must be free from
scratches, horn - marks and
tick-damage. At the Union
Stockyards of Chicago, cattle-
owners are fined one dollar a
head for all horned cattle for-
warded for sale, because con-
siderable damage to the hide
is caused by horned cattle in
trucks, yards and lanes round
the slaughtering - establish-
ments.
The curing of all hides
needs great care, both in salt-
ing and slacking. There must
be enough salt and the stack-
ing must be done so that
correct drainage can take
place.
In the coastal districts of
Queensland* a lot of damage
is done to hides by ticks,
mostly on the neck, shoulders
and belly, which are the
thinner parts. Where hides
become badly pitted by tick-
bites, it is impossible to
remove these impressions ; so,
to find use for this type of
leather, it is usually embossed
to imitate crocodile or reptile
patterns. If used on the flesh-
side these hides are generally
made into suede types of
leather.
Dairy-cow hides are mostly
thin and used extensively for
light-grade leathers. The bulk
of all Jersey hides is exported
to the Continent and Japan.

DEVONS

'T'he Devon breed, already
well established in Aus-
tralia, could play a prominent
part in expanding beef-produc-
tion for both home and export
markets. Breeders and intend-
mg breeders would do well to
explore its potentialities when
extending their present activi-
ties or embarking on any new
ventures.
The breed possesses all the
virtues for which the experi-
enced and discerning cattle-
man looks.

A more versatile breed
would be difficult to imagine
—and this. is no idle claim.
Devons are bred throughout
the whole of Australia, from
Tasmania to the Gulf coun-
try, and they adjust themselves
readily to changes of environ-
ment. Their ruby-red color is
particularly good, as it affords
valuable protection against the
hot rays of the sun.; further-
more, the dark pigmentation
around the eyes renders them
less susceptible to eye-cancer
and troubles arising from dust
and grass-seeds than are
unpigmented eyes.
Compact, well - sprung,
strong and exceptionally sure-
footed, they have been found
to “forage” in drought-time
even to the tops of mountains,
while beasts of other breeds
succumb. Devons thrive on
natural pastures of all descrip-
tions, yet respond splendidly
to scientific feeding. Their
fertility is high, they calve
easily and have an ample
supply of good milk for their
calves.
To quote a breeder in Natal
(South Africa): “I have never
yet had to help a f ema l e at
calving-time.” Devon calves
h a y e comparatively small
heads, which is very helpful
when crossing with small-
boned breeds. Another good
feature is that they mature
very early and are ideal for
crossing with dairy-cattle to
produce quick - maturing
vealers.
In a saleyard, the butcher’s
first interest is always in the
Devons. From his viewpoint,
the appearance of the dressed
carcass is attractive ; the
cutting-waste is low ; joints are
nicely marbled ; the hind-
quarters weigh heavier than
the forequarters and give a
greater percentage of higher-
priced meat . the an imals are
quiet and easil handled
„ , , . ... .
England is still the greatest
producer of Devons, which,
addition to Australia, are
b A e f e oun< ? in Brazil the
C.S.A., South Africa and, to
a lesser extent, in Jamaica,
New Zealand and Kenya;
other countries are showing
interest. Reports from reliable
sources in overseas coun-
tries, as well as Australia, have
stated enthusiastically that
Devons imported from Eng-
land from time to time over
long periods have proved their
worth in a remarkable manner
in their new surroundings.
The breeding of Devon
cattle, or “the red rubies,” as
they are often called, can be
traced back in south-western
England for about 300 years,
though authorities think that
the breed may be much older
than that.
The Quartly and Davy
families were apparently the
leading pioneers of the pure
Devon breed, and it is known
that the Davys bred these
animals for at least 150 years
prior to 1851, the year in
which Lt.-Col. John Tanner
Davy, to whom we are
indebted for the compilation
of the first herd-book, started
recording the pedigrees of the
animals of his time.
Australia’s own records dis-
close the breeding of pure
Devons in Australia for over
100 years.
The Amos, Grubb, Tre-
thewie and White families were
among the early pioneers of
the breed. Today there are
71 registered Devon studs in
Australia. The leading Aus-
tralian studs, in alphabetical
order, are Boorara, Yalleroi
(Q.); Glen Moan, Willow
Tree (N.S.W.); Havilah, Mud-
gee (N.S.W.) ; News t e a d
South, Elsmore (N.S.W.);
Retford Park, Bowral
(N.S.W.). Glen Moan are
actively interested in scientific
breeding. The owners of
Havilah, Newstead South and
Glen Moan have proved for
themselves conclusively the
extraordinary adaptability of
the Devons to all types of
circumstances and the con-
sistency of their breeding
and performance throughout,
which .supports the claim of
Devon breeders the world
over that from all aspects the
Devon is the ideal beef-breed.
To assist the Australian
beef industry generally, Aus-
tralian studs make young pure
Devon herd-bulls available for
purchase at low cost.

The ban on the importation
of cattle from America to Aus-
tralia in 1956 resulted in a
shortage of pure-bred Santa
Gertrudis bulls, but that posi-
tion has now largely been
overcome by the availability of
locally-bred bulls. One sequel
to the ban was an increasing
demand for first-cross Santa
Gertrudis bulls.
Hybrid cattle-crossing in
Australia was stimulated at the
time by a report from Dr.
Albert O. Rhoad, geneticist
and husbandry advisor to King
Ranch, Texas. Dr. Rhoad came
to Australia to judge Santa
Gertrudis cattle at the Brisbane
Royal Show in August. He is
also advising the Santa
Gertrudis Breeders’ (Australia)
Association on the grading-up
of Santa Gertrudis cattle and
Santa Gertrudis-cross cattle.
He said that experiments at
many United States centres had
clearly shown that wide varia-
tions in type and productive-
ness in hybrid cattle-crosses did
not materialise if proper breed-
ing precautions were taken.
Dr. Rhoad said that King
Ranch had successfully used
many hundreds of half-bred
bulls on its commercial herds
before pure - bred Santa
Gertrudis bulls were available.
At an early stage in the King
Ranch operations about 10,000
grade Shorthorn cows had been
bulled with half-breds and
some higher grades when they
became available. Dr. Rhoad
added that where good founda-
tion-stock was used, good half-
bred Santa Gertrudis bulls
could be used on good cows
of the English parent-breed
with satisfactory results. He
emphasised that half-bred bulls
should be used on cows of the
maternal parent’s breed.
For example, a half-bred
Santa Gertrudis-cross Short-
horn bull should be placed with
Shorthorn - cows, not with
Hereford or Angus cows or
vice versa. This report created
great interest among breeders
in Australia and hybrid cross-
ing-programmes were carried-
out with considerable success.
There’s no doubt that the
Santa Gertrudis breed of cattle
has come to stay in Australia.
Few Australians had heard of
Santa Gertrudis a short time
ago ; now the name is familiar
to a great number of people
outside the cattle and meat
industries.
other breeds. Most vealer-
producing herds prefer to
remain pure-bred, in order to
maintain a supply of pure-bred
heifers for replacement. This
is certainly the best answer.
However, there are plenty of
commercial herds in which
Shorthorn or Hereford bulls
are used 'on Red Poll females.
Calves from these crosses sell
extra well —with a target of
7501 b. at 10 months.
This type of beef-production
suits large or small herds and
has the advantage of giving a
heavy stocking-rate for the
months when feed is normally
good and a light stocking-rate
after the calves are weaned.
But the keynote for success is
Red Polls’ early maturity and
their growth-rate, supported by
the cow’s nine-month—often,
10-month —lactation and the
calf’s naturally good carcass.
majority of more than 13-
million cattle in this country.
All the great herds of the
back-country and in the Terri-
tory are Shorthorn, as it is
only the Shorthorn that does
well. These herds consist of
between 20,000 and 30,000
head, all Shorthorn, and it is
these cattle that we read about
walking their hundreds of
miles into Alice Springs,
Bourke and other railheads.
Shorthorns are not seen so
much on the coast and in the
more densely settled areas, but
their numbers are growing.
However, in these areas it may
well be that the prepotency of
the Shorthorn bull for crossing
with other breeds will become
better known. The famous
blue-roan, so sought-after by
the butchers, is a product of
the Shorthorn on Aberdeen
Angus females. Then there is
that well-known red-roan of
the Hereford-Shorthorn cross.
Also, when we get to the stage
of beef from the dairy-herds,
then the Shorthorn stands
alone. The greatest hurt any
man ever did to any one breed
was to propagate the idea of
color-marking calves from the
dairy-herds. It is not the color
of the skin that counts but the
amount of meat they carry.
The beef-Shorthorn story is
not complete without mention-
ing its allied breeds. First,
there’s the Poll Shorthorn, to
all intents and purposes a
Shorthorn which has been
evolved with no horns ; then
there are the dairy-Shorthorns,
which up to the present take
their place with the beef-types
in Coates’ Herd Book in Eng-
land —these are the same
animals bred for milk. The
famous Australian Illawarra
Shorthorn is a local breed
developed from the Shorthorn,
and the new breed, the Santa
Gertrudis, is five-eighths Short-
horn. In South Africa the
Shorthorn Afrikander is con-
sidered a breed on its own.
BEEF-CATTLE IN SOUTH AUS.
By R. W. McNEIL
Beef-cattle Adviser, Dept, of Agriculture, South Australia.
CJouth Australia does not
produce enough beef to be
self-supporting, and varying
quantities come from inter-
state.
The Adelaide market is the
outlet for cattle from around
Alice Springs, to which it is
linked by rail and which
supplies up to one-third of
S.A.’s requirements.
The supply from Queensland
and N.S.W. is unstable, be-
cause stock-route movements
to rail can be hazardous in dry
times, while thgse States have
another choice of markets to
the east.
The pastoral areas of Central
Australia supply the greater
part of our beef and the
southern areas the rest, with
about a quarter from the dairy
industry. This supply is split
into two spheres, part of which
comes from summer-rainfall
and the rest from winter-rain-
fall in the south. Therefore
it seems that South Australia
should have a regular and
evenly distributed supply of
beef.
The risk, however, is in the
summer-rainfall areas, where
the greater portion of our beef-
supply is produced, and where
seasonal differences are very
great.
It is possible that good
summer rains over a large area
of the pastoral country will
produce sufficient quality beef,
but on the average this sort of
season only occurs about once
in three to five years. The
stability of our market is
greatly affected by this un-
certain supply.
The general practice of
pastoralists in Central Aus-
tralia has been to sell fat-cattle
—mainly three- and four-year-
old male cattle. This policy
seems risky, because cattle have
to be held until the fattening
year comes and during this
waiting period severe losses can
occur. The scope for these arid
areas to produce more fat-
cattle is, therefore, limited, be-
cause of the seasonal fluctu-
ations.
Statistics show that, over the
last 10 years, cattle-numbers
have doubled throughout the
State. In the pastoral areas, the
increase has only been approxi-
mately 33 per cent. The greater
increase has been in the
southern areas, where cattle
have become part of farm-
management.
Practically all this increase
has been absorbed for local
consumption and very little has
been available for export.
If we are to maintain our
increasing consumption, we
must look for ways of pro-
ducing it. One step has already
been made by freeing a large
area of Central Australia from
pleuro-pneumonia. This will
allow the free movement of
store-cattle for fattening from
these inland areas to the south.
It will also enable the Cen-
tralian pastoralists to turn-off
cattle annually, instead of
following their previous pro-
gramme of only doing so after
a favorable season.
A programme of breeding
young store-cattle in these
areas has been started and a
record number of these stores
were fattened in the southern
area last season.
The demand for boner-type
cattle has brought a lot of
cattle onto the market much
sooner than they would have
come under normal conditions.
Increased slaughterings of
these boner-type cattle last year
aipounted to a 20 per cent,
increase in killings.
These increased slaughter-
ings, in conjunction with the
drought-conditions which cover
most of the State at the present
time, must result in beef being
a scarce commodity in the near
future.


admittedly has limited pros-
pects. The debit side shows that
droving has suffered through
loss of experienced manpower
and eaten-out stock-routes,
where there is often inadequate
water. Railways, generally,
have not improved in efficiency
and rolling-stock has not been
brought up to standard.
Diesel - powered locomotives,
put into operation in all States,
have improved running times
arid may reduce costs, but light
narrow-gauge lines have not
been strengthened and Govern-
ment loading facilities are still
primitive in design and lacking
in proper maintenance. Broken
gauge between States has
proved difficult and costly in
speeding up transportation.
Concession-rates to induce
cattle-producers to use railways
or other Governmerit transport
at certain times of the year
have been cancelled.
The cattle industry is expand-
ing, and there is room for
further enormous expansion.
Therefore, it is of national
importance for advantage to be
taken of all existing markets, so
that Australian beef attains a
standard to compete favorably
with beef''from such countries
as the Argentine, where Gov-
ernment and private enterprise
have paid the closest attention
to the handling and raising of
stock. The Argentine trans-
port-system was brought to an
efficient standard mainly on
British capital. Today Argen-
tine herds have declined and
the country is suffering set-
backs with political interfer-
ence, so Australia’s chief com-
petitor is weakened ; therefore,
the Government must strive to
improve our transport-system,
not only to keep step with the
great development that is going
on in the beef industry,
but for our future prosperity
in all branches of primary
industry.
SELLING AUSTRALIA'S BEEF
By F. A. BRODIE
From the vast Mitchell- and
Flinders-grassed plains of
the Kimberleys, Northern
Territory, Queensland and its
coastal areas comes the bulk
of our export-beef. States with
cities of high population con-
sume most of their own pro-
duction.
There is a world-wide con-
sumer-preference amongst all
but the few to whom cost is
of no account for beef of high
meat- but comparatively low
fat-content. The long, rangy
bullock, which in past days
walked slowly from the Gulf
to Wodonga ahead of Clancy
and his mates, is out of
fashion. The call is for beef
“Your horse just KICKED my horse!”
from young, light- to medium-
weight cattle, and Australia
will not fully develop the
world market open to it until
Clancy swaps his saddle for
the driver’s overalls of fast,
efficient road- and rail-trans-
porters, for transport is the
key to our production prob-
lem. Our meatworks are as
modern as any in the world,
our labor forces, both in the
plants, on the trains and on
f, / • - _
the wharves, are giving a pretty
fair go, but our transport fact-
lities take far too long and are
far tr»n fpw
i luo iw. .
We produce in carcass-form
about 800,000 tons of beef,
. i , ,
eat about 1211 b. a head a year,
can about 75,000 tons, and
export the balance. Our
u .y . li . ~
historic market is the united
Kingdom, which takes an
average of about 115,000 tons
a year, whilst some 25 other
countries, excluding the
United States, take about
30,000 tons.
Australia has a long-term
agreement under which it con-
tracts now to supply its ex-
portable surplus of first- and
second-quality beef tO ( the
U.K.
The freeing of third- and
MX-grades from October,
1958, has led to a spectacular
development in trade with the
United States, which is a large
consumer of this type of beef,
About 60,000 tons of boneless
beef has been shipped, and
by reason of a ready accep-
tance in our production-plants
of the buyer’s rigid require-
ments on standards of packing
and hygiene the reputation of
this beef is high. This trade
provides a market for the vast
reserve of older breeders,
which now die yearly in the
Far North. Again, transport
is the key.
The year 1958-59 has shown
a record for beef-exports,
which, with by-products, have
returned about £stgBs million
and $45 million,
R. W. Mitchell, Research
Officer for the Australian Meat
Board, reported recently:
The U.K. can use up to 160,000
tons of frozen beef a year of which
Australia (the main supplier) has
a mar ket for, say, 100,000 to
110,000 tons. The demand is very
inelastic—high frozen-beef prices
do not reduce demand, and, con-
versely, low frozen-beef prices do
not stimulate demand. These prices
determined by the level of
chilled and home-killed prices and
availability of frozen-beef. Plenti-
ful supplies of frozen-beef depress
P. rices without increasing consump-
tion and conversely a shortage of
supplies increases prices without
reducing consumption,
Mitchell sees prime urgency
to step-up exports in the chilled
form to take up what is hoped
will be an ever-increasing sur-
plus. This means the turn-off
of cattle at an early age, a
better turn - round of the
modern fast refrigerated ships
which are already available,
and still better internal trans-
port.
With full effort from every-
body concerned, the future of
Australia’s beef - industry is
limitless.
ON JUDGING
By ANTHONY HORDERN, JNR.
'"pHE ability to become a great
judge is a gift not given to
many people. A judge has a
thankless task, because he
knows that, in all probability,
he will not please everyone all
the time. Of course, he’s
appointed for his knowledge of
cattle and of the particular
breed in question, so he goes
into the judging-rmg to make
his selections, and his every
move is watched and criticised
by the experts outside the ring,
He must ignore this and go
about his job of selection.
A judge should be reason-
ably quick and definite, know
what he wants, and be a bit
of a showman He must
therefore, have the ability to
sum-up his animals as a whole
and not be carried away by
too much detail.
When sitting watching a
breed being judged at Sydney
Royal, I have often overheard
people ask: “What’s he look-
ing for?”—“he” being the
judge. Of course he is looking,
amongst other things, for
breed-type and character, an
animal sound on its legs, and
quality. A bull, of course,
should look every inch a bull,
masculine, with great strength
of head and eye. On the other
hand, a cow should be essen-
tially feminine with that sweet-
ness of expression and kindly
eye that gets all the men in.
Judging steers alive is a dif-
ferent job altogether, and there
i s muc h discussion today
whether they should be judged
alive at all, whether they
should be judged simply as a
carcass, or whether they should
be judged as a whole, and some
even would like to judge
according to a series of
measurements
As a breed j f see
an animal jud d F as a whole>
J ,
that ,s say ’- the judge takes
in t° consideration not only the
carcass but other things such
as S°°d legs, and good jaw and
muzzle to eat and breathe with.
So it can be seen that a
judge’s “lot is not a happy
one,” and I always feel that a
judge is only happy when his
champion bull fetches the
highest price at the subsequent
sales. He knows then that his
opinion is shared by many.

(From “C.A.L.”): Mother Ship-
ton (B. 19/8/’59) was born at
Shipton, near York, and died at
Knaresbro. She prophesied that
Cardinal Wolsey would see York
but never reach it; Wolsey only
saw York from a distant hill when
the King recalled him to London.
At Clifton, one mile out of York,
there is a stone called “Old Mother
Shipton’s Stone.” Mother Shipton
was said to be a very pious and
generous woman and lived to a
great age. The following prophecy
was first published in 1448 and
republished in 1641:
Carriages without horses shall go
And accidents fill the world with woe;
Around the world thoughts shall fly,
In the twinkling of an eye
Water yet shall more wonders do,
How strange, but yet they shall be true.
The world upside down shall be.
And gold be found at the foot of a tree.
Through hills man shall ride,
And no horse or ass be at his side;
Under water men shall walk,
Shall ride, shall sleep, shall talk.
In the air men shall be seen.
In white, in black, in green;
Iron in the water shall float,
As easy as a wooden boat.
Gold shall be found am) shown,
In a land that is not now known.
Fire and waters shall wonders do,
And England shall at last admit a Jew.
The world to an end shall come in 1881.

No. There are laws that prevent

the other thing, or standing on
your head without a permit, but
nothing that stops you using a
bulldozer. It is, of course, always
possible for you to proceed against
any person who is causing you dis-
comfort by noise by several pro-
ceedings under the law relating to
nuisance. Of course, you can do
this for noise made on any day, but
the fact that it is on Sunday makes

Some particulars about Magnetic
Island ?
It is a mountainous and thickly
wooded island in Halifax Bay,
North Queensland, 19 square-miles
in area, rising to 1628 ft. in its
centre. Some of its bays are
enclosed by coral-reefs. The island
is renowned for its beauty and is
a favorite resort for Townsville
people. Koalas were introduced
in the 1930’s and they appear to
have become established, under
conditions of sanctuary. Captain
James Cook called the island
Magnetical Isle in 1770 because he
thought that the compass of the
Endeavour' had been affected by
magnetic ore in its hills; but sub-
sequent navigators did not confirm
this belief.

Biographical details of novelist
Sherwood Anderson ?
Born at Camden, Ohio, U.S.A.,
on September 13, 1876; educated
at Wittenberg College. During the
Spanish-American War he served
in Cuba, and after that became
successively manager of a paint-
works and an advertising copy-
writer before turning to litera-
ture. His earliest novel, Windy
McPherson’s San, appeared in
1916, but his first real success was
“ That's what I call a salesman !”
with a collection of stories and
sketches, Winesburg, Ohio (1919).
Other such collections, which are
often ranked higher than his
novels, were The Triumph of the
Egg (1921) and Horses and Men
(1923). His novels include Poor
White (1920), Many Marriages
(1923) and Dark Laughter (1925).
A Story Teller's Story (1924) and
Tar, a Midwest Childhood (1926)
are autobiographical. After visit-
ing Europe in 1921 he settled in
1924 in Marion, Virginia, and
became editor of the town’s two
newspapers, one Republican and
one Democratic. He was married
four times.

What is bimetallism ?
Webster’s definition is: “The
policy of employing, or the
employment of, two metals (as
gold and silver) to form at the
same time, in combination with
each other, the standard of value;
especially, such employment under
the conditions of free coinage to
either metal with the right of
debtors to discharge their debts at
their option in either of the two
metals at a ratio fixed by law.”
The term was coined by H.
Cernuschi in 1869 and denotes a
system under which two metals
(i.e., gold and silver) are equally
available as legal tender. Cernuschi
regarded the term as applicable
mainly to international, as distinct
from national arrangement, with
a number of States agreeing to
adopt the same ratio in value
between the two metals.
The Encyclopcedia Britannica
states that the last attempt to
secure international bimetallism
was made by U.S. Senator
Wolcott’s commission in 1897.
Soon after that, bimetallism as a
popular cause disappeared, due
mainly to the increase in the output
of gold, which removed all dread
of a “gold famine,” and the
consequent adoption of the gold
standard by so many countries.

system; hence, order, har-
mony”! So “combos” becomes
an even more neat reduction
of “combinations,” and par-
ticularly so when applied to
Benny Goodman’s combos —
quintet, sextet, septet.
There are 12 bands on the
disk, recorded between 1939
and 1944; thus the material
dates from Benny’s top period
in the field of small-unit work.
Benny was a sort of pioneer
in loosing the shackles of
swing-music laboriously and
heavily churned-out by rela-
tively huge orchestras ; he pre-
ferred, like Robin Hood, a
small band of picked men,
each a soloist in his own right.
Anyone who has heard such
daring and modern spirits as
Dave Brubeck exploiting the
resources of a trio in pre-
dominantly improvised jazz
will probably agree that
Goodman, in terms of fore-
sight and imagination, was a
good man.
Benny himself figures, if
not stars, in every number on
this disk. The basic quintet
set-up appears to be clarinet,
piano, bass, drums and vibra-
phone—and what a charming
instrument this vibraphone is!
In the first track, for instance
—“After Y o u’v e Gone,”
recorded November 16, 1944 —
it vies glassily for virtuosic
honors: a brisk and appealing
tune, this, and on second
thoughts one would say that
perhaps Goodman is the star
of this number after all. “Star-
dust,” an even earlier record-
ing (October, 1939), is music
with a beat; “Benny’s Bugle”
(1940) is done by a septet, with
pianist Count Basie in top
form ; and in “On the Alamo”
(fourth band on the first side)
you’ll find some of Goodman’s
smoothest clarinet - playing.
There’s nothing wrong with the
way a 1945 sextet handles
“Slipped Disc”; a peculiar title
on the surface, but when one
hears the tune, all ribaldry and
boniness, the link-up is cun-
ningly slippery.
On the second side there is
“A Smo-o-o-oth One” (sic),
recorded by a septet in 1941,
and it certainly is; “AC-DC
Current,” suitably electric in
its stamping drum-beat and
silver vibraphone flourishes;
“Liza,” which is cast in
roughly the same mould as
background-music for one of
the old silent films, with the
important differences that it’s
extremely well played and the
piano is not one of the tinny
variety; and there are two
more —“As Long as I Live”
and “Breakfast Feud”—before
the last one, “Gilly,” recorded
in 1940 by Benny Goodman,
clarinet; Cootie Williams,
trumpet; Georgie Auld, tenor
sax.; Ken Kercey, piano;
Charlie Christian, guitar;
Arthur Bernstein, bass; and
Harry Jaeger, drums.
A pretty good line-up, and
really this is one of the best
tracks on the record: a vigor-
ous and resolutely drum-
pounded tune, expertly filled-
out with what, one imagines,
are florid extemporised
passages.

Another Vol. of de Vol
For Vol. 2 of the Coronet
Album of Irving Berlin (KLP
784) Frank de Vol and his
orchestra have plattered
another two-dozen of the
tuneful pieces which earned
Berlin the title (bestowed on
him by Gershwin) of “the
greatest American song-
composer”—and several mil-
lion dollars to boot.
One wonders whether Berlin
ever wrote a failure. He can
hardly have had time to —he
'was kept so busy writing suc-
cesses. Sometimes the success
was immediate, as with
“Mandy,” the strutting cake-
walk that was the hit of his
all-soldier revue at the end
of World War I, or “A Pretty
Girl Is Like a Melody,” a
Ziegfeld Follies theme-song.
Sometimes the action was)
delayed, as with “Marie,”
written as a waltz in 1928 for
“The Awakening”—a film
starring Vilma Banky, one of
Rudolph Valentino’s film-
loves. The real awakening
didn’t come till nine years
later, when Tommy Dorsey
put it over as a foxtrot —and
sold a million records.
These three are among the
current two-dozen de Vol
renditions. So are some of
the best numbers Berlin wrote
for the Ginger Rogers-Fred
Astaire films, including four
from “Top Hat.”


Women's Letters
SYDNEY
A highlight (in more ways than one)
of the Royal visit was the superb display
of fireworks at the civic reception given
at the Showground by Lord Mayor
Jensen and Mrs. Jensen. “Even better
than the Harbor display during the
Queen’s visit,” seemed a general verdict,
and it was a dramatic finale to the
world-premiere of “Burragorang Dream-
time,” an aboriginal fantasy of the origin
of the waratah and the boomerang.
Another item the 30,000-odd onlookers
thoroughly enjoyed was the musical
ride by the N.S.W. mounted police ; the
coats of the horses burnished to per-
fection, the precise and graceful
manoeuvres carried-out to the music of
the police-band. The Princess wore a
jacket-dress of lacquer-red satin-brocade
embossed in gold mimosa, and a band
of the same material in her hair.
Mrs. Jensen was in a dress of soft
delphinium-blue, with a curvette of the
same color.
Before Princess Alexandra attended
the Golden ball at the Trocadero (which
added £3OOO to the funds of the Royal
N.S.W. Institution for Deaf and Blind
Children) she was at a dinner-party given
by the Governor, Sir Eric Woodward,
and Lady Woodward at Government
House. Guests included the Governor’s
son-in-law and daughter, Dr. and Mrs.
M. Little, Rosemary Ashton, Henry
Arnott and Anthony Vincent.
Waratahs predominated in the floral-
decor for the State reception to Princess
Alexandra, for which Gosford should
receive due credit. There was some con-
cern beforehand that sufficient blooms
would not be available, but growers in
that area came to the rescue and sent
hundreds down for the occasion. The
dress worn by her Royal Highness
seemed to win higher approval than any
other in which she has appeared. It was
of exquisite white lace, scalloped neck-
line in front, and the bodice cut in a
low square at the back, making a very
effective contrast with her smooth
Queensland tan. (There was little oppor-
tunity until the weekend for the Princess
to deepen the tan here, the earlier
weather being cool and showery.)
The Premier and Mrs. J. J. Cahill
welcomed the Princess, Mrs. Cahill wear-
ing a dress of deep-blue lace made with
a floating-panel at the back of its slightly-
flared skirt, and a small hat of velvet
bows in shades of matching blue, pink
and red. Their son and daughter-in-law
were among guests presented to the
Princess, Mrs. Cahill Jnr. looking attrac-
tive in a dress of silk-shantung of Paris-
pink and a small hat with a cut-out
crown and banded with a pink-and-white
ruffle. A stunning outfit was worn by
Mrs. Bruce Macfarlan, there with her
husband, Mr. Justice Macfarlan. Of
her own design, it was of silvery-grey
satin and chiffon, off-the-shoulder, and
caught in front by a large square topaz
brooch, a family heirloom. Silver-grey
(in pure silk) was also the choice of Mrs.
Charles Cutler, who accompanied her
husband, leader of the Country party ;
with it she wore a small hat of white
petals. Mrs. Tom Bateman’s pure-silk
dress, in a floral-design, was worn with
a little black curvette. Also in the
gathering were to be seen Salvation
Army bonnets, W.A.A.F. caps, flower-
and tulle-creations, black-velvet bands,
and roses on little wisps of veiling. Mrs.
H. S. Sudjan (there with her husband,
the Trade Commissioner for India) wore
a very handsome sari. Veiling of a
violet shade to match the outsize silk
rose she wore on the bodice of her silk
dress was worn as a cocktail hat by Mrs.
Sutherland, wife of the Hon. Gavin
Sutherland.
Lady Woodward, wife of the Governor,
Lieut.-General Sir Eric Woodward, was
hostess to H.R.H. Princess Alexandra at
Government House during her stay in
Sydney. Despite many official duties
Lady Woodward finds time to take an
active part in the work of many different
welfare-organisations. She is president
of N.S.W. Red Cross Division {an excep-
tionally busy position in this centenary-
celebration year); patron-in-chief of the
Family Welfare Bureau ; and a patron
(with the Governor) of both the Far West
Children’s Health Scheme and St. John
Ambulance Brigade.
The Princess must have enjoyed her
free day at historic Bective homestead
on Sunday, especially the bush-picnic on
the bank of the Peel River, when a
packed lunch of beef and chicken sand-
wiches and oranges was shared by her
lady-in-waiting, Lady Moyra Hamilton,
and the five grandchildren of their
hostess, Mrs. James Vickery. They were
20-year-old Jennifer, 17-year-old Robert
and 13-year-old Peter Vickery, their
cousins Jim and Phillip Alker, 24 and
18. Nice, too, that the chestnut, Golden
Times, was her mount —a championship
winner at the last Moree Show.

A family-heirloom handed down from
her great-grandmother was the “some-
thing old” which Valerie Taylor wore
for her wedding with Dougal Macdonald
at Scots Kirk. It was a heavy gold
brooch, set with a large pearl, which she
pinned at the neckline of her white satin
gown, which was cut on simple lines,
with a small bow at the neck and another,
slightly larger, at the waist. Her veil
was of tulle, and she carried one lovely
pink rose. Her bridesmaid was in lilac-
pink embossed satin, and her bouquet
was of roses and pink-hyacinths. For the
reception at the home of the bride-
groom’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Graham
Macdonald, of Mosman, banks of flowers
in different shades of pink were inter-
spersed with white azaleas, and dozens
of candles in silver sticks provided the
lighting. The bride’s parents were the
late Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, formerly of
Brisbane. After their honeymoon, the
young couple will live at Canberra, where
the bridegroom is attached to a Govern-
ment department.

Melbourne visitor Mrs. Frank Davies
found time while holidaying in Sydney
to visit Warwick Farm races on
Wednesday and back four winners. She
is a keen racegoer, and was hoping her
luck would hold for the Saturday meet-
ing at Randwick. When encountered,
she was doing a spot of window-shopping
with pretty young Robyn King, also of
Melbourne, whose school-holidays from
Merton Hall had been spent in the sunny
north.

M. Bignon, visiting Frenchman - and
president of the S.F.T. (huge textile
organisation) is a man of great charm
and decided views. But he expressed
these only out of a deep concern that
the well-dressed Australian woman
should have to step-out socially with an
escort whose dress was lamentably un-
suitable for such a duty. In short, M.
Bignon thinks women should take a
stand, before the national-dress of our
men becomes sports-coat and slacks;
they should refuse to accompany them
unless they don correct attire. Although
the idea seems a good one in theory,
who wants to stay at home until the


revolution is won? The visitor (whose
own outfit was impeccable, from the care-
fully-knotted silk tie which was of deep
claret with a small design in black and
matching hanky in breast-pocket, to
snowy linen and wrinkleless charcoal-
grey suit) seriously advocates 12
children for every Australian family—or
punishment by fine!
MELBOURNE
The city is gay with decorations and
excitement has been mounting in anticipa-
tion of the arrival of Princess Alexandra
today, Wednesday (Sept. 16). Tomorrow
(Thursday) there will be a display by
schoolchildren at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground, and on Saturday thousands of
young guests will attend a garden-party
given by the Governor and Lady
Brooks at Government House. Young
people will again be in the picture when
Princess Alexandra attends a Junior Red
Cross luncheon at Lady Dugan Home,
and they will be well in the majority at
the City of Melbourne Royal Ball at the
Town Hall. The Premier has decreed
that the Princess shall not be subjected
to the ordeal of multiple hand-shaking
at Government functions —a decision that
should win general approval.

The first civic reception given by the
new Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
(Cr. and Mrs. Bernard Evans) was in
honor of Cardinal Agagianian, Papal
Legate for the Queensland centenary
celebrations. The hostess chose a charm-
ing frock-and-jacket ensemble in pale-
beige wool-romaine and a high-crowned
cloche of azure-blue, white and beige
linen-straw misted with veiling. Guests
included the Anglican Archbishop of
Melbourne, Dr. Frank Woods; U.S.
Consul-General Graham Hall and Mrs.
Hall (the latter’s waist-length jacket-suit
of navy shantung worn with a side-swept
cap of white feathers); Lady Connolly

The chairman of the Council of the
Royal Commonwealth Society, London,
the Rt. Hon. the Earl De La Warr, and
his Countess were guests-of-honor at
the society’s monthly luncheon in the
Lower Town Hall. The Countess chose
a white-and-green-printed silk frock, an
avocado-green wool coat and a toque
in several shades of green. Among those
at the luncheon were the Lord Mayor
and Lady Mayoress, Cr. and Mrs.
Bernard Evans (she wearing a back-
belted suit in spring-green wool and a
brown toque swathed with champagne-
tinted chiffon); Lady Hercus (wearing
a suit of deep-grey jersey and a small
hat of pervenche-blue wool-jersey); Sir
John and Lady Latham ; Mr. and Mrs.
Ray Trickey ; Lady White ; Professor Sir
George Paton ; Brigadier and Mrs. R.

A dental-nurse by day and an actress
at night has been the routine followed
by attractive 20-year-old Lyndell Rowe.
With experience gained at the Melbourne
Little Theatre in such productions as “It’s
Never Too Late,” “The Crucible” and
“The Pet Shop,” she plays the role of
Sidonia in “The Waltz of the Torea-
dors,” by Jean Anouilh, which is the first
production of the Union Repertory
Theatre in association with the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust, with John Sumner
as producer. Lyndell has joined the com-
pany as a permanent member. Her other
interest is ballet, which she has studied
since a child in Queensland, where she
was born.
When Elizabeth Jane, second daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Chirnside, of

over heavy poult. A high coronet of
lily-of-the-valley held her tulle veil
and she carried a Victorian posy of
lily-of-the-valley in her great-grand-
mother’s silver bouquet-holder. The
bride’s niece, Jane Austin, and her
cousin, Rosalind Andrew, attended her,
wearing long white organdie frocks
which had ruffled necks, puff-sleeves, and
olive-green satin sashes. They carried
posies of spring-flowers. The bride’s

There was a spontaneous burst of
applause when the curtain rose at the
Comedy Theatre for the world premiere
of Ray Lawler’s play, “The Piccadilly

really outstanding. In the audience were
the Governor and Lady Brooks, with
their son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and
Mrs. Robin Byrne ; Mrs. Dorothy Nan-

latter wearing a deep-cream taffeta coat
over a cream lace frock trimmed with

Proceeds of the first night’s perfor-

Adults. Lady Brooks, the society’s
patroness, wore a slim-fitting frock of
cornflower-blue Chantilly-lace mounted
on satin, with matching satin shoes. She
was welcomed by guild-director Laurel
Martyn, the president of the society, Sir

the Ladies Appeal Committee, Mrs.
Norman Welsh. Lady Brooks’s daughter,
Mrs. Robin Byrne (who was one of the
ticket-secretaries), covered her short full-

fish-scale on his forearm to prove it;
though one rather suspects that she,
too, came aboard chiefly for publicity.
And the general account of the
voyage, if it rarely reaches again so
high a peak of drama, even when they
are sinking and being rescued by the
Chilean frigate, has its rewarding
moments. If the fish that so much
enlivened the Kon-Tiki voyage were so
scarce that for a whole month Bisschop
and his friends couldn’t catch a single
one to eat, there was at least one great
day when they were simultaneously
wrestling with a dolphin, a swordfish
and some other unnamed monster, all
of which they lost in the excitement;
and then there was the day when they
caught a 65-pound dorado and, while
one of the crew ate its heart raw,
investigated its .stomach and found
that it had swallowed a 30in.
Gempylus—an occasion for great scorn
upon the Kon-Tiki voyagers who had
declared this fish to be a rarity from
the uttermost depths. However, though
de Bisschop says the fish is “common
as the common sardine of Douar-
nenez,” only three specimens, includ-
ing his own. seem ever to have been
captured, so it is still rare enough.
Readers not so interested in these
fishy matters will still find pleasant
companionship in de Bisschop’s pig,
which, intended to be eaten on the
voyage, became a dear friend to all.
They used to talk to it when they
couldn’t bear to talk to each other any
more; they gave it beer to drink; and
eventually when it had to be taken
aboard the rescuing frigate they gave
it a bottle of Chilean wine which not
only put it to sleep but turned its ears
red —Chilean wine, like this book,
seems a pretty heady brew.
The Wilder Shores of Love
In The Wilder Shores of Love
(Penguin Books) Lesley Blanch tells
the amazing stories of four 19th-
century women who, according to the
preface, “all found in the East glowing
horizons of emotion and daring which
were vanishing from the West.” They
found what they wanted, or what they
thought they wanted, in an extra-
ordinary diversity of lovers.
Jane Digby, in turn Lady Ellen-
borough, Baroness Venningen, and
Countess Theotoky, finally settled in
the Arabian desert with the Sheikh
Abdul Medjuel El Mezrab, with whom
she came to an unusual compact. For
half the year they were to live in a
tent in the wild desert and she was to
have exclusive possession of her hand-
some, ardent and devoted husband;
for the other half she was to be a
humble member of his harem. The
scheme apparently worked well, for
she lived an extraordinarily vigorous
and interesting life and died at a great
age, remarking as she did so that her
love affairs would read like “a naughty
Almanach de Gotha.”
On the other hand Aimee Dubucq
de Rivery had love thrust upon her.
A cousin of the Empress Josephine,
she was convent-educated in the West
Indies and at sixteen -happened to be
travelling between her home and Paris
when corsairs raided her ship, seized
her and took her to the Dey of Algiers.
The Dey at that time was anxious to
placate the Grand Turk, and, observ-
ing her beauty, thought she would
make a nice present for him.
He little knew the brilliant results
that were to ensue from his action. She
was duly incarcerated, along with 400
others, in Sultan Selim’s harem, where
she caught the eye of the chief eunuch,
who led her to his master. It was a
case of love at first sight, she bore
him a son ten months later, and the
son became Sultan Mahmoud 11, the
great reformer of the Turkish empire.
In the meantime, from the seclusion
of the harem, Aimee practically ruled
the empire through the most turbulent
and bloody period of its history,
negotiating as an equal with France,
England and Russia. She, too, died
at a great age and was buried with
the utmost degree of Oriental pomp
and splendor.
More commonplace but even
tougher was Isabelle Eberhardt, a Slav
girl who picked-up with the Saharan
Arabs, shared their board, their beds,
their savage orgies and their wild
sorties and finally performed the
surprising feat of being drowned in
the desert.
The only one of this unconventional
quartet who had a really distinguished
lover was Isabel Arundel. The scion
of a rich and aristocratic Catholic
family, and conventionally brought-up.
she happened to meet Richard Burton
and on the spot decided he was her
predestined lover who would lead her
to the wilder shores of love that she
had dreamed of. He was already the
greatest Orientalist of his time, and
possibly of all time.
He had made his famous haj to
Mecca, was acquainted with. a score
of Eastern religions, was a Moslem,
spoke 29' languages, was a colossal
student insatiably curious about every-
thing Oriental, and had had practical
experience of that Eastern eroticism
which disgusted the Englishmen of his
generation when he introduced them
to the secrets of it by translating the
“Thousand And One Nights” without
bowdlerising them as Lane, their
previous translator, had done. He had
explored the mysteries of Indian
harems and Persian brothels, in
between discovering the sources of the
Nile. He was both loved and hated by
the British Foreign Office, but,
because of his extraordinary know-
ledge. was indispensable to it; so that,
whenever an Ambassador got into a
muddle with Turks, Arabs or Afghans
it had to send Burton out to rescue
him from his ignorance, usually sack-
ing Burton afterwards for getting too
friendly with the heathen.
Burton had. according to one
observer, “no prurience, but rather an
immense gusto, a roaring. Elizabethan
quality of bawdry, . which, oddly
enough, found its counterpart in some
aspects of Eastern sensuality.” . This
was a queer fish for a properly-brought-
up Victorian miss to fall romantically
in love with; but marry him she did.
and not only that, set out to share his
strange life and obey his every bidding
with an almost hysterical determina-
tion. He on his part never altered his
behavior one bit, and, although she
would possibly have preferred a more
humdrum husband, she grinned and
bore it while, in one or another of his
innumerable disguises, he continued to
slip out from the domestic hearth on
savage and mysterious adventures.
Burton himself used to taunt her by
pointing-out that while she was
destined to spend eternity in the
Christian heaven, he would be in the
bosom of Allah with the houris.
According to her biographer, this
preyed on Isabel’s mind extremely.
She was determined that, if they could
not be of one faith and monogamist
in this life, they would be in the here-
after, and she scored a triumph when
she succeeded in getting a peasant
ALL THOSE VIKINGS
All those Vikings were poets,
Though they killed and plundered.
Returning from the intractable Celts
They hung over their sails
The bright, strong-woven, stolen bales,
As they oared homeward
In a dying summer.
And the tow-haired chief of the ice-isle,
Whose eyes were broken bergs,
Running for his freedom, fell,
And stayed to lace his thonged skin-boot,
Crying, “No matter, I would not get home
Should I run from now to firelight.’’
And that one in Shetland ■' r
Who shortened by a head
The wicked Orcadian earl,
And drank by the fire ;
Bur, to the night cried out at going:
“Do not give the head to the flames;
It is an evil thing
To burn a bearded earl.”

priest to give her husband Extreme
Unction when he was on his deathbed.
He, however, got his revenge later,
by making her the executor of his
unpublished manuscripts and his pri-
vate journals, in which he had put on
record with infinite detail all those
experiences in which his wife had had
no share either before or after their
marriage. Tolstoy, incidentally, did
the same thing with his wife, but that
was on the eve of their marriage.
Poor Isabel read and read with
mounting horror. Ruskin was placed
in the same predicament when he was
made the trustee for the British nation
of Turner’s figure-drawings, done
mainly in brothels. If these were pre-
served what would happen to the repu-
tation of the late president of the
Royal Academy? Isabel reasoned in
the same way—if these were printed
what would happen to the reputation
of Sir Richard Burton? For days and
nights they both prayed for divine
guidance, and then, sick and distraught,
they both came to a similar decision:
Ruskin burned hundreds of Turner’s
finest drawings and Isabel burned
what Burton thought was his greatest
work, “The Enchanted Garden,” and
all his priceless private papers. It was
a sad finale to the life of a really
remarkable woman.
M.G.S.
Drama in Akaroa
Claud Evans’s So Laughs the Wind
(Pegasus Press) is a play about old
Akaroa in the South Island of New
Zealand, where the French settled.
It opens, encouragingly, with a
funeral—the heroine’s crippled sister
has just died —and thereupon the play-
wright proceeds to lift the lid off
Akaroa in a series of pops, like the lid
of a stewpot rising, to reveal that the
place is seething with ghosts, neurotics
and sin. The heroine, Annette St.
Alery, is haunted by memories of her
French sweetheart who dropped-in
once to inspect the tombs of his ances-
tors and then went away and was
killed. The old house is haunted by
the laughter of a child who pops out
of a grave in the garden and eventually
manifests himself to Annette, while she
is playing sad music, in the shape of a
spooky little boy dressed rather like a
hussar. He climbs the pear-tree in the
garden because it reminds him of a
sailing-ship.
Annette is also haunted, though we
do not learn this till late in the piece,
by memories of a child she was going
to have to the French sweetheart; and
her puritanical old aunt, who has
savagely been sitting on her through-
out the play, is also belatedly revealed
to be haunted by sin—she is a
bigamist.
Fortunately there is a happy ending
to all these direful problems.
Annette’s doctor thoughtfully (though
improbably) arranges for her to adopt
a real little French boy, a refugee, to
cure her of her hallucinations; and
then completes the cure by marrying
her. The widowed, bigamistic aunt
most surprisingly solves her own prob-
lems by marrying a rich Australian
cattleman from Queensland or the
Northern Territory who says “Strike
me!” and “What do yer say?” and who
impresses his New Zealand friends by
talking about the terrific Queensland
heat when it was 103 in the shade—
he would impress Australians more if
he said it was 123.
In its origins and atmosphere the
play seems an odd blend of the sinful
American plays of the Deep South with
a dash of “The Cherry Orchard” (the
blossoming pear-tree) and, when a
drowned fisherman reappears alive
and dripping, Maxwell Anderson’s
“Winterset.” The dustjacket says it
was well received when it was played
in Christchurch last year, and it may
well be of interest to amateur dramatic
groups; but its sinful and ghostly
atmosphere is not convincing in print,
and its literary quality is not what we
have been led to expect from the
Pegasus Press in the past. It would
be better if, as some of the amusing
scenes with farmers and fishermen
prove he can do, Claude Evans simply
showed us what life is really like in
Akaroa.
Reviewed Briefly
Later Chinese Porcelain: Soame
Jenyns (Faber)'. By the Assistant
Keeper in the Department of Oriental
Antiquities in the British Museum,
this is the second, revised edition of
a beautiful and scholarly book for
connoisseurs, describing the porcelain
of the Ch’ing Dynasty (1644-1912). It
is especially concerned, not with the
“famille verte” and “famille rose”
wares which were made for export to
the European market but with the less-
familiar porcelain of the same period
which the Chinese made and kept for
themselves. There are two reproduc-
tions in color and a host in black-and-
white.

The Hard Blue Sky: Shirley Ann
Grau (Heinemann). For her first novel
the author has chosen as background
a small, windswept island in the Gulf
of Mexico, where the inhabitants have
for generations lived a hard life on
their narrow strips of land on the edge
of a swamp. There is Annie, longing
for the outside world—and men—and
old Mamere, regularly summoning a
priest across the sea to help her fight
death. The characters include fierce
old salts, budding delinquents and a
couple whose love-affair is more of
a tough battle than a romance.
Tension is built-up when a local man
disappears oh a fishing expedition,
hurricanes and treacherous bayous add
to the drama, and taken all round it’s
a hard story of a tough-living people.
* * * *
Three Among Mountains: Humph-
rey Slater (Wingate). Deep insight
into motive and a sharp sense of irony
lift this thriller well above its class.
The three petty criminals who kill
their guards and escape from a French
jail-bus are in reality an Englishman,
a Spaniard and a Russian, each
engaged on a special and extraordinary
mission for his country. Pursued by
French police and the Gestapo, they
stick together for safety, heading for
Spain. The chase is described from
both sides with innumerable touches
of irony springing from the escapees’
ignorance of each others’ true identity
and from the conflict between the
prison authorities, the police and the
Gestapo. Their final escape, due to
a political struggle within the French
Resistance group which captures them,
is a beautiful contrivance. Slater is
one of those rare novelists—like
Richard Hughes and William Golding
—who can tell a highly improbable
story exactly as one feels it would
happen if it could.
