Land Taxation—Its Justice and Advan-
tages.
The Bulletin.
SATURDAY, JULY 3. 1886.
Strangely enough, the strongest objection
taken to the proposed imposition of land
taxation in New South Wales is some taint
of injustice which it is said to involve.
The objection does not turn upon the inci-
dence of the tax, [but is based upon an
imaginary freedom from State burdens,
which land is assumed to enjoy. As no
definite grounds for this opposition have,
within our knowledge, ever been stated, and
no attempt to substantiate the claim, save
by bare assertion, having been made, it may,
at first sight, seem needless to prove that
the immunity does not exist; but every
wrong idea, however baseless and illogical,
possesses influence over the minds of some
members of the community, and should be
attacked when, as in the present case, such
influence has a mischievous tendency. S trong
reasons for this immunity must be proved
before it can be recognised, for the first prin-
ciple of Government is that the property of
the individual is held under the protection
of the State, and is subject to levy for the
public good. Upon principle itis impossible
to conceive any grounds to justify, or even
favour, the total exemption of land from
liabilities which attach to every other species
of property or possession, and, as we shall
presently urge, both equity and expediency
demand that a large proportion of State
revenue should be derived directly from the
land.
* * «
Unlike every other description of pro-
perty, land is a thing which no man can
claim for his own, because made by himself.
The improvements upon it may be his own
manufacture, but the land itself cannot be*
So also with the value. Apart from the
Value of improvements, the market price of
the land must consist entirely of unearned
increment. The latter fact is not usually
comprehended as it should be. If a Sydney
Bite is worth £.OOO per foot, every penny of
ibis is Unearned increment. Once the land
was not worth the smallest coin of the
Veaim: all of its present value has come to
it by process of development of the colony.
The State has given to the land every penny
of its surface value: to the State therefore
m all equity a return is due by the holder
lor his security of possession. Here we
would willingly follow Henry Geobgb in
arguing that the whole value which the
State has made should belong to the State,
but such an argument would go beyond,
though not entirely away from the present
Bu bject. There is another point which tells
strongly against the supposed immunity
fom taxation of the land monopolisers, and
is contained in the fact that the land is
estate. The protection of Government
onl y extended to property within the
crritorial limits, and, on the other hand
roteetion must be given to all who have
6 r Property or domicile there. Therefore,

is strongly opposed to such an indulgence,
on the contrary, it demands that the obli-
gation should be fully enforced.
* • •
National expediency also strongly favours
this form of taxation. All other taxes,
direct or indirect, either act, like income
and property taxes, as a penalty upon in-
dustry, or else limit consumption by in-
creasing the cost of the commodity upon
which the impost is levied. An unimproved
land tax would operate in a totally different
manner. It would not be a tax upon in-
dustry, for, as we have seen, it is the State,
not the man, that creates this taxable sur-
face value; nor would it limit enterprise as
a property-tax necessarily must. If houses
are subjected to a tax the supply of new
houses will be restricted until the demand is

sufficient to raise the rate of rent so as to
cover the amount of taxation. In this latter
case the tax is borne by the tenant. But the
supply of land cannot be restricted, and as
the tax is levied only upon what we may
call its “area value,” whether it is lying
vacant, or is covered by a £lO,OOO building,
matters not, the amount payable to the
State will still be the same. The land-tax is
thus a bonus to industry, for those who turn
their estates to the best use, and improve
them the most, pay the smallest propor-
tionate rate on the annual rental. Nor does
the tax fall upon the consumer, in this case
called the tenant. On the contrary, any
possible effect of the land-tax will b© to his
advantage if he rent the land for the sake
of the house upon it. As we have shown,
the owners who improve their land most by
building thereon escape with a lower per-
centage of tax on their annual return.
Here, then, is a direct incentive to increas-
ing the supply of houses, which exceeding by
reason of this new impetus, the demand,
will certainly be let at a lower rate of
rent. Upon the landlords the whole of
this taxation will fall; it is not, therefore,
remarkable that Sydney Bctbdbkin, now
M.L.A. for East Sydney, strove to replace it
by an excise on beer.
• • »
Expediency is also to be estimated by the
revenue a land-tax would produce. It is
foreign to the present purpose to go into
figures and state precisely what amount
may reasonably be expected to accrue to
the national coffers, for the effect will be
similar in all save degree, hovevtr many
thousands are raised. For the opening of a
new source of revenue will enable legisla-
tors to.lessen the heavy demands upon other
channels of supply. It would be possible to
make the land-tax act as a substitute for
some of the impolitic, unjust, and burden-
some duties now levied upon the necessaries
of life. If such duties on articles which
cannot be produc-d here were given up, the
decreased cost of living would afford an
immense impetus to toe manufaotu . « i
dustries, for the labourer could then profit-
ably work for a lower wage. Hitherto an
entirely different policy, miscalled Free-
trade, has ruled New South Wales, Foreign
manufactures have been admitted free,
and the cost of production -within the
colony increased by means of heavy imposts
on the fuel of labour—the necessaries of life.
Not less than 1 2)4 per cent, of the value of
tea, % of the cost of tobacco, and l-4th of
the price of coffee goes to the State by way
of tax, and so on with other necessary com-
modities. Yet while the poor mechanic
cheerfully pays 10 per cent, of his scanty
breakfast towards the expenses of Govern-
ment, the Bbbdekins of the Assembly and
Ai.ixa.ndeb Campbells of the Council
would try to get the required revenue out
of colonial beer or anything else rather than
pay a wretched 2)4 per cent, of their own
ample land revenues. Two and a half per
cent.— 6d. in the pound 1 Why Tom the
navvy and Bill the boundary-ridtr pay
more than that to the revenue in buying 3s,
worth of tea or a quarter of a pound of
tobacco. Riches and miserable selfishness
usually rest beneath the same roof,
♦ ♦ •
A very great advantage attendant upon
land tax would be its power to break up
most of the immense estates which are the
curse of many of our inland towns ; huge
areas are worked with one man and a cross-
bred collie* while their owners hold on for
the increment which comes to them because
of the industry of others. It pays many a
landowner to clear only 1 per cent, out of
his estate if the unearned increment is at
the same time adding 10 per cent, more to his
land-capital annually; but with a land-tax
taking away a full fifth of that 1 per cent.*
and the money value of the land perhaps
actually declining, he would [soon find it
necessary either to make better use of it
himself or else sell it to someone who could
do so. This consideration brings us face to
face with the objection that “ the land-tax,
by reducing the value of the land, decreases
the wealth of the community.” But it must
be remembered that this price, which some
mistake for wealth, is merely its value in re •
lation to other commodities ; the land is
always of the same area and quality, how-
ever much its market value may fluctuate.
If land that was formerly valued at Is. is
now sold for £5 per foot, this does not
show that the sum of national wealth
has increased by the stated increment.
Appreciation of land-values may be a sign
of prosperity, but doe.' not represent an
actual increase of wealth. To argue the
contrary would be to assert that running
up the price cf its scrip increases the value
of a mine. In this latter case men advance
the price, because they are assured of the
prospect of commensurate returns, but the
veriest fool who ever invested in shares in a
mine, never believed that the richness of
the ore was increased by the higher estima-
tion in which those shares were held. But
in reality there is no depreciation of the
land-value, although, as between buyer and
seller, lower prices may rule. What takes
place is somewhat after this fashion. Let
it be supposed that the land, immediately
before the tax is imposed, returns 4 per
cent, of its capital value yearly by way of
rent or otherwise; the State, by imposing a
tax of )4d. in the pound on that capital
value takes, say l-20th of the annual rent re-
turn. Then the owner finds that he now
receives only 95 per cent, of his former
return, therefore the estate is worth to him
only 95-100:hs of its former capital value,
the other 5 per cent, being, as it were, taken
by the State to produce the yearly tax. For
the State, by levying the tax, appropriates
as much of the property as will produce the
tax each year. The land-value then does
not aciually depreciate, but is divided be-
tween the private and the public owner.
Estimating the; return of all taxable estates
at an average of 5 per cent, per annum, a
land-tax producing £200,000 should reduce
the total of their selling value by £4,000,000,

which amount would then represent the
share of the State in lands held by private
owners.
• • •
This digression concluded, we may re-
sume consideration of the tendency and
power of a land-tax to break up large
estates. The action would possess preven-
tive as well as remedial virtue. To relieve
the colony in some degree of the fetters of
land-monopoly is undoubtedly a large
benefit, but to ensure against the operation
of causes which are working up to a fearful
social eruption in England, is a labour
worthy of all true patriots. It is to Great
Britain that we mustlook for an adequate in-
stance of the evil of the aggregation of real
estate in a few hands. Here are statistics
taken almost at random, to show the extent
of the existing monopoly thereOne-
fourth of England and Walei together, is
held by 693 persons; two-thirds of Scotland
by 330 men; while in Ireland one-half of
the total area is in the hands of 730 owners \
One English peer receives Loidon ground-
rents amounting to £300,000 a year, and the
reversions will produce £1,750,000 annually;
another has a present revenue of £170,000
from the same source, with reversion to
£1,500,000; and several others have similar
incomes and reversions, but little below
these in value. While on the other hand, as
we have recently been informed by high
authority, very nearly one-sixth of the
whole population of the United Kingdom
are paupers, wholly or partially dependent
upon public charity. One million of the
residents of London—that triumph of civili-
sation —are said to be without sufficient re-
sources to ensure them a single meal, and
the applicants for parish relief increase far
beyond the synchronous increment of the
whole population. While the senseless ex-
travagances of aristocratic imbeciles and
blackguards daily reach new heights,
the deep wail of anguish from outcast
London each day grows more acute and
desperate. Occasional recitals of suffering
lift for a moment a corner of the veil which
enshrouds the homeless and helpless, and
affords a faint idea of the depths of misery
to which the poor have sunk. The mute,
passionless, enduring heroism of the famish-
ing thousands defies the power of descrip-
tive eulogy. A mighty and hopeless multi-
tude endure the lingering death by gradual
starvation rather than rise in violation of
the laws which are slowly forcing them out
of existence. They mutely suffer the oruel-
est of oppression rather than infringe the
law which their ruthless and insolent oppres-
sors have made. Endurance, patience, hero-
ism such as theirs finds not its equal in the
story of the colleagues of Leonidas, the
annals of Christian martyrdom, or the re-
cord of Waterloo. The fierce Italian would
long since have plunged his stiletto through
the heart of his oppressor; the Frenchman
would have made London re-echo with a
fierce “ A has les aristocrats,” as his fore-
fathers did Paris nearly a century since; the
Spaniard would have resorted to robbery
and murder long before he permitted his
sufferings to reach the acute stage ; but the
law-loving English pauper starves and dies,
as his successors in ever-increasing hordes
will have to starve and die, until a coming
generation learns that there is a point
at which endurance ceases to be a virtue,
and, simultaneously, awakes to the fact
that that point has long since been passed.
The vengeance will be in proportion to the
suffering ; the triumph be measured by the
misery; the punishment be apportioned to
the past oppression. If a land-tax in New
South Wales were to do nothing more than
avert such fearful misery, and so terrible a
retribution, it would still, without reference
to present national gain, be the duty of all
who are patriots to their own country to
give it their strong and unselfish support.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Which Madgwick?
THE Sydney D.T., in a sub-leader, inquires if
the Reverend E. B. Madqwick, who set his
clerical blucher right square down on the Home
Rule movement, and solemnly protested against
the presence of Sir Henry Parkes, Sir P. Jen-
nings, Mr. Barton, and other members at the
meeting held on Monday to encourage the In-
famous Gladstone in his firebrand designs upon
the unity of the British Empire, [is the same
Mr. Madgwick who has figured as chaplain
of the Orange institution. We hope he is.
One Madgwick at a time is about a fair
thing for a young country like this. We
Know he is, when we read what he has
to say about it. The voice is the voice of the
defunct William of Boyne, Madgwicked by the
“ long result of Time.” In support of his “ solemn
protest ” against the assembling of a few publi c
men to sympathise with the noblest effort of one
of the noblest and bravest men God ever created—
an effort that aims at giving a small Instalment of
justice to a nation as foully wronged, and as brut-
ally misgoverned as ever a nation was—he airily
refers to the financial state of New South Wales at
present, and thinks anything more ill-judged could
hardly be conceived. If he had also pointed
out that there are mile-stones on the Dover road,
he would have rounded his protest to a lucid and
telling period. There is, in all this reverend
gentleman has to say, an underlying malevolence
and stupidity that “ will not down.” If the signa-
ture had been Feargus O’Connell M’Gladh-
bighan, Instead of B. D. Madgwick, we should
still have scented the L.O.L. and cried " Fie I . .
What a savour. . . Bring civet I” It isn’t any
good, reverend sir. It doesn’t matter how you
protest, or how solemn you are over it. The
slow—too slow—atonement of Home Rule must
come to the unhappy island soon, and all the
weak childishness of Orange lodges, and all the
high devilry of lodge-fed sectarian hatred, is too
weak to delay it much longer, don’t you forget
that. It is Kismet, and your sweet following must
bow to it as they have bowed to the Disestablish-
ment blow administered long ago by the same fist,
and look as amiable as things will admit. Neither
prayers nor curses nor printed incoherenoies can
bar the inevitable “Out, and clear the way.”

Borne Buie Wins.
It was a mighty and enthusiastic multitude that
assembled in the New Masonic Hall, Sydney, on
Monday night, to declare sympathy with, and ad-
miration of, Mr. Gladstone and his Irish pro-
posals. There was no mistaking the thorough
genuineness of sentiment; there was no question
of Its unanimity. And the speakers spoke up to
their subj act—spoke straight, and coined the words
from their very hearts. It was the Jo triomphe! of
a magnificent cause—the cause of Justice : a
worthy corner-stone of a noble monument erected
to the Right. Upon the platform and connected
with the movement there were the highest politi-
cians in the colony. Sir John Robertson,
Sir Patrick Jennings, and Mr. Barton were
the most prominent actors in the scene; they
affirmed the meeting as representative of the
whole people. Whatever assistance the daily
press of the city could give was given. Home
Rule has been recently commented on by countless
leaders, exalted by numberless paragraphs. Yet
the memory need not go far back to reach a time
when all these conditions were different. It is
barely three years since Home Rule was by the
Herald esteemed as a device of the Evil One;
and the Telegraph, the News, and the little
Echo could find no epithets too bitter for those
who supported it. Then the Redmonds came to
Sydney, and a fierce cry went up against them.
They were boycotted from the public halls
of the city ; no place could be allowed them
wherein to plead their cause, although thei r
language was more moderate then than that
now used by Speaker Barton on the same
subject. Mr. Henry Copeland was almost
the only member of Parliament who had the man-
hood to appear on the platform with them,
although one other, the patriotic Dan. O’Cohncr,
is said to have satisfied his national aspirations by
standing somewhere out of sight. Only one editor
of anon-sectarian paper in all Australia dared to
use his pen in the cause of J ustloe—that one was
William Henry Traill, a Scotcman and non-
Roman Catholic, until recently the managing
director and a proprietor of The Bulletin. Philo-
Hibernlanlsm was not then respectable. Its justice
was as manifest then as now, but it had not been
sanctified by Gladstone, and the Nationalists
had not attained power and influence. The prin-
ciple then was identical with that now so in"
fluentially supported, but to affirm it then meant
personal loss of one kind or another. To condemn
it was to gain popularity. So the Herald de-
nounced it, and Sir Henry Parkes, at a faked-
up Orange meeting, acted as denunolator-ln-ohief
of the Redmonds, their mission, and their cause.
Yet now, forsooth, the same Parkes who admires
everything that Gladstone does—would that
Gladstone could return the compliment!—shares
in the triumph of a cause of which he was but a
few months ago the fiercest, most bruta',
opponent. When there 1s glory and repute to be
gained, newspapers and politicians alike will rush
forward to claim their share: but in this apotheosis
of the Home Rule cause, it should not be forgotten
that there were some men who supported it long
ago, because of its abstract justice, and of those
the most ardent and daring were Henry Cope-
land, F. B. Frbbhill, and the then editor of The
Bulletin, William Henry Traill. It is owing
in a large degree to them that the cause was sus-
tained here in its earlier stages, when the Herald,
Sir Henry Parkes, and the whole army of bigots
arose with one universal cry to bury it beneath
a torrent of prejudice and misrepresentation,

The Troubles of School Teachers.
For anyone who desires to live by teaching In
the New South Wales State schools, it is far better
to be born a girl than a boy. The Department
pays far better salaries to the weaker than to the
sterner sex, and allows very much more rapid
promotion. From a recent return it appears that
male teachers in charge of flfth-clasi schools
average 36 years in age, 12)4 years of service, and
receive £337 14s. 51. per annum salary, but from
this must be deducted the £l3 a year paid on
account of tuition in sewing by the teacher’s
wife, thus leaving £315145. sd. as the master’s own
pay. Female teachers of similar qualification,
averaging years in age and 7 years’ ser-
vice, are paid an average of £315 Is. 61.
only 13s. lees than the malts, whose average
age exceeds theirs by 8)4 years, and who
have been in the service 5)4 years longer. Some
of the contrasts in individual cases are very glar-
ing. Miss Emma Chambers, for instance, who is
mistress of the Infants’ Department of a second-
class school, and who has only been in the service
for 3 years 7 )4 months, is paid £253; while Mr. A. E»
Roberts has served 34 )4 years and only receives
£328, of which £l3 is presumably paid for his wife’s
services. Thus with equal qualification the man
is rated at £36 a year less than the woman, who is
26 years younger and 31 )4 years his junior in office.
The explanation of the Department would be that
girls rarely stay long in the service—they resign
after a few years and get married, so that
there is a constant need of promotions to
supply the vacancies thus created. Men.
on the other hand, rarely resign until they
are too old to continue their work. Thus, the
chances of promotion are much smaller in the
one case than the other. Men may toil on for
30 years, and get less at the end of that time than
a sweet young thing of the opposite sex, who has
only been two years in the service. No wonder,
then, that young men of ability refuse to join a
department which can offer them so little Induce-
ment. The Department may find that applica-
tions come in as readily as ever, and that they
have no difficulty in obtaining juniors, but the
quality of the recruits must deteriorate under
such a system. The apportionment of salaries
must be more just as between the sexes, unless
they desire that the rising and succeeding genera-
tions should be Instructed by a lot of dunderheads
who see no prospect of getting on in any other
profession, and take to teaching as a last resource.

The Bulletin's advice to those intending

Melbourne Punch states that Lake Roto-
mahana “has disappeared and in its place is an
Island of mud and lava.’’ As the lake is gone that
Island, we presume, Is surrounded by land.
Judge Powell, of South Australia, says
that for a debtor to offer 6d. in the £ “is an insult
to the court.’’ Debtors have, therefore, resolved
to retain the humble coin in future rather than
insult anybody.
The Sydney D.T. reporter, in his wire about
Parkes at Candletown, says " The weather was
very propitious, the sun shedding the lustre of his
rays more generously than at any previous time
during the tour.” Shedding the lustre of his raysl
Hang it-is the sun moulting ?
A parson at Motuere (N.Z.) has got notice
to quit because he refused to administer the
Sacrament to those members of the church who
were Oddfellows. He said that “God didn’t make
Oddfellows; they were a mere worldly invention.”
The only things the Almighty ever made were
parsons.
A boss-drover had used, in presence of his
men, the expression “ Nectar lit for the gods.”
One of the crowd noticed the favourable im-
pression that this made on the publican, and tried
it on at the next shout. “ Hooray,” said he,
“ here’s a necktie fit for—well, the rest would be
blasphemous.
Some weeks ago a “ wave of madness”
broke out in Qailicla (Austria). Observations
showed that it was travelling at tremendous speed
in a south-easterly direction and heading for
Sydney. It arrived at the N.B.W. Legislative As-
sembly on the night of the 24th June, rather out
of breath, but in good working order.
The Melbourne Herald occasionally
sports a “ Social ” column, containing weird and
wonderful accounts of marriages and things like
that. The other day the Herald hit off a bride’s
appearance in a sweetly original fashion. It said
she “ was young and becoming.” As Polonius
might have observed, “ becoming ” is good,
A Sydney publican has, we read, dis-
charged his sinner of a barman, because he was a
Freethinker. In future, the assistant at a high-
class Sydney groggery must be able to repeat the
10 commandments, and give a coherent account of
the wanderings of Israel in the wilderness, before
he is allowed to sell rum to the children of light.
At Moruya, N.S.W., Mrs. Mary Ann Kee
Chong sued William Colefax for pinning her dress
to a form In church. The case lasted three days,
and the excitement threatened to rend the very
foundations of society, but in spite of a magnifi-
cent speech by the plaintiff's lawyer the charge
was dismissed. There is talk of an appeal to the
House of Lords.
A correspondent to a French paper calls
Adelaide “La Rome de I’Australie.” We did not
know that a large part of the elite of the Eternal
City consists of peccant secretaries of pious
young men’s associations, Sunday-school teaching
emcezz'ing bank clerks, and swindling bank mana-
gers in full swing as lay parsons. But then we live
farther away from Rome than from Adelaide.
“At Masterton, N.Z., the Rev. J. 0.
Andrew, for failing to clear his station of rabbits,
was fined £5O and costs.” How is it, we wonder,
that a man who has given up all his goods to feed
the poor comes to own a station ? And how is it
that fie reverend one tolerates rabbits on his run ?
When we had a station we prayed the rabbits off
it. It’s just as easy to pray away rabbits as it is to
pray down rain.
A rabbiter died. Nothing remarkable in
that. But the storekeeper found him a few days
afterwards and reported him to the boss, who
said, “TakeDarkle in the spring-cart and fetch
him in.” He was brought to the head station
for Christian burial, but there was no prayer-
book, and no one was a Scotchman, so a compro-
mise was made. They planted him, and sang two
verses of “ God Save the Queen ” over his grave.
Mr. Reid recently stated in the Victorian
Parliament that “ a man named-well, Morlarty
will do—had been taken out of the Kew Lunatic
Asylum and put into the Custom House as
a draw-back officer.” The example seems to
us worth following. If the Civil Service were
periodically run into the Lunatic Asylum and the
Lunatic Asylum into the Civil Service it would
afford a pleasant change and agreeable recreation
to both parties.
We read that “a peal of eight bells ha
just been completed for Bt. Saviour’s Church,
Eastbourne, at the expense of a young authoress,
known as Edna Lyall. The three new bells bear
the names of the neroes of her books—Donovan,
Eric, and Hugo.” To advertise three-volume
society novels on a church steeple is, no doubt,
playing it rather low on the law and the prophets,
but it might be worse. We have a peal in a church
near our office in Sydney, and the name of the
loudest bell, which plays the deuce with our
attempts to sleep on Sunday morning, must be
O’Donovan. Perhaps, however, it’s Moriarty.
A Melbourne man, one Hodnett, recently
captured a burglar in his house, and had to sit
upon him for over an hour while his brother
hunted for a policeman to take him in custody.
A Sydney man once did the same, and years after-
wards an intelligent detective got on the scent and
found two skeletons, one sitting on the top of the
other. A look of patient expectation was stiff
traceable on the skull of the upper skeleton, ana
his eye-sockets were fixed on a copy of the Morn-
ing Herald with which he had endeavoured to
pass the time, while on the remains of the burglar
were found a “jemmy ” and a dark lantern. B° tn
were arrested on suspicion.

The New York

of that (one-time Aus-

writer remarks that
“The conscious and ego-
tistical Mr. Bellew lives

acts from the time ho

I don’t believe the man

*■ His great adventure
was the liaison with the
Countess d’Agoult
(Dan el Stern) who was
the mother of bis three
children. They were
Blondine, who became
Madame Emile Olllvier;
Coslma, born at Lako
Como, who has been suc-
cessively Madame Hans
von Bulow and Madame
Wagner: and Daniel, who
at the age of 17, died on
a couch covered with
love-letters addressed to
nim by femmes du monde.
The Countess d’Agoult
was beautiful, even in
her old age, and coquet-
tish to an extreme de-
gree. Her dress was al-
w ys pearl-gray covered
with lace, and in order to
make herself appear
transparent, she had her
bedroom hur g with black
velvet. Liszt and the
Countess lived In Bellag-
glo, on the banks of Lake
•Jomo, for years, and the
cause ©f their separation
has never been fully ex
plained. He says there
was a difference of
oplultTn witn reference
to the training of the
children, who remained
with him. Thetr irlends
say they separated be-
cause he met the_ one
whom he called Princess
Miriflque. At her wed-
ding feast Liszt was
seated by her; she was
only 16. and nothing more
beautiful had ever been
seen by bim. Que vouU%~

ceeried In wlnn.ng the
confidence of the bus-
band and the love of
the bride, so that when
they left for Italy, their
new friend crl<d ; ‘lf
1 were to go with you ?
They were delighted, and
the “friend” accom-
panied them on Ihe wed-
ding journey. The news-
papers talked, the hus-
band became a little
troubled, but Liszt said
be was only the guardian
of so much youth and
beauty. During the con-
certs given during this
liaison, Liszt wbull never
play until the * Princess’
was In her box. One
evening at St. Petersburg
the emperor, empress,
princesses, all were there,
and as soon as Liszt ap-
peared bouquets
showered from every
box The ‘ Princess Mirl-
tlque’ alone kept hers—
she bad quarrelled with
the maestro L’szt was
pale, kept his eyes fixed

■would not touch one of
the flowers before re-
ceiving hers. The audi-
ence understood the
trouble, and the emperor
sent his alde-de-oamp to
the ‘Princess’ with the
order to throw her
boufju.et acd put an end
to the scandal. She
obeyed, as women usually
obey, with reserve. She
gave her flowers to the
officer, w ho threw them.

wards those thrown by

mailre was horribly
jealous of ‘ Princess Mirl-
fique.’ and allowed no
man to pay her any at-

Insisted that she should
be invited wherever he
was. Once a German
Prince engaged him to
give a concert at Kms.
At the last moment Liszt
returned the money he
had received acd refused
to play, because tha ‘Miri-
flque ’ ha.d not been in-
vited. His life with the
Princess Wittgenstein is
well known. She is the
aunt of Princess Bayn-
Wlttgensteln-Say n,
■whose troubles have been
mentioned before. This
amie could not obtain the
annulment of her mar-
riage from the Pope, in
order to marry Liszt. He
became a priest, and says
that the tonsure has
saved him on earth, and
he hopes in heaven. He
is very faithful, It must
be acknowledged ; says
Maps every morning, and
confesses often. But he
has cared more for the
admiration of women
than for anything else on
earth. He must be satis-
fled, for up to the pre-
sent time he has been
followed by magnetised
women, willing for him
to leave family and coun-
try without looking back
and without regret. One
enthusiastic woman calls
herself his guardian
angel, and eay| she was
sent from heaven to save
him from accident and illness. If he drops a glove

The congregation of
St, Michael, Melbourne,,

while Byoub Pasha, after burying about 400 dead
Turks and 1200 Greeks, who had given up being

When the gluttonous Roman Emperor

brothers. The biggest eater in Australia Is a
merciless judge who, when on low diet, takes a

pagne at one sitting. It would be as well-so as to
hold the animal la check—to put this gentleman
on prison-fare while the Criminal Court is sitting.
“ Arthur 8. Ogilby, secretary and treasurer
of the Dime Savings Bank of New Brunswick,

his friends tried to raise the amount, but being
unable to get the full sum had him adjudged a
lunatic and committed to an Insane asylum.” So
they do it in Amurriker, do they ? We thought it
was an original Sydney trick, based on a £lOO COO
transaction.
Sir William Clarke, the Victorian Bart.,
paid £lOO for the royal box at the opening of the
gaand colonial show. A London paper calls this.
“ a wicked sum.” We should call it a derned good
sum, and we do trust that the unobtrusive baronet
duly caught his monarch’s beye and took his
money out in regal smiles. The wonder Is that the
ghost of Clarke pere didn’t arise In his wrath and
expostulate with son William for slinging away a
cool " century ” for a sight of a stout old lady of
67.

Foote got on to the rock or has been washed

ahead with their probate.
Be the exodus of the gingerbread princes
from France, as reported by cable last week, It
seems that the delectable Prince Napoleon and his

ever getting his head inside a crown. French
national sentiment may rush him into the purple
some day or anotner on account of his extraor-

When, as a mere youth, he attended the funeral
of Napoleon HI. in England, Victor Was “ faked

Fermanagh, Ireland, but were long resident in the

At the Hobart meeting on the rabbit- 1
extermination trouble, a comparatively unknown
man arose and suggested that for the purpose of
exterminating the rabbits suddenly, utterly, and
without any possible chance of failure, a special
day should be fixed upon some two or three
months ahead, in order to allow adequate time for
preparation and concerted action (itfbn which
the chief success of the plan depends), and on this
day in every church in the land, and in every
where the Inmates were prevented from
attending a church, special, long, and earnest
prayer-meetings should be held re this rabbit. Bv
Monday night, or, at the latest, the following
Tuesday morning, it is estimated that all
the rabbits in the island will have been
removed in, a manner not plainly to be
comprehended by the ordinary Intellectual
faculties, but, nevertheless, in a way that may be
fairly anticipated by the spirit of faith. Of course
there may bo a few selfish and self-seeking indivi-
duals, who, for their own immediate profit, or
from pure oussedness, might by the action of pri-
prayer ? u 5 ce f d in saving a few rabbits from
the general destruction ; and to obviate thin
possible drawback it is proposed that a sufliolent
quantity of specially-reserved prayer be after-

In a)7Fc o ri^ Contin 9 nfc ;i, last a suggestion appears
i u seriousness in the correspondence column of
John s favourite paper that an Australian laureate
B i b< h UI » be fPP° lated > and the writer explains that
John Rae is undoubtedly the man for the place.
His poems, we learn, are far superior to Tenny-
son s, and he only wants “a fair opening to pro-
duce gems which would eclipse in brilliancy the
sadly-tarnished efforts of our national bard.”
Most poets produce their gems, and thus make an
opening for themselves, but John Rae wants the
opening first, and the gems afterwards. The
modest poet, however, replies to this and other
admirers, saying that “Tennyson’s masterpieces
occupy a place to which he oannot aspire.” Pro-
bably suen little things as “In Memoriam” are
he meaa=, beyond him, but no doubt he will knoex
‘ °5 “ The Charge of the Light Bri-
gade, into a cocked hat. He declares his willing-
ness, however, to enter for a competition for the
post of laurea e, and will most allcomers in verse.
One of his best efforts appears in the same paper,
and as very few great poets have ever tuned the
lyre to dLcourse of i teak and onions, or things of
the kind, one verse is worth quoting:—
“ The table in the dining-hall
dad dishes laid for nine.
At one the family heard the call
And all sat down to dine;
Each had a relish for the food,
Which was so tresh and sweet,
The soup was grand, the meat was good.
The pudding quite a treat.”
John bas a great future before him if he can only
find out his true mission. Now-a-days, poetry is
used by the bootmaker and the tailor as a means
of advertising, but no restaurant-keeper, so far as
know, has ever yet set his bill of fare to music
and had the hashed mutton turned into a waltz, or
the calf s head rendered as a quadrille. The man

and convert soup Into verse, would realise a for-
tune In this branch of Industry, By cutting hari-
cot mutton into short metre, a'nd corned pork into
hexameters, he would throw a veil of true
sentiment over common every-day things, which
could not tail to elevate and refine the huokry
crowd who are catered for at a shilling ahead,
and if he could afterwards go down into the
kitchen and compose a lyric on the slops or an ode
to the remains of the hind-quarter of mutton the
work would be complete. As a poet in the
ordinary acceptation of the term, however Tnhn
is absent, and he would do well to avoid 111 iubllo
competitions. If the contest lay between nw 0

we would unhesitatingly back the former and give

A Modern Miracle -Restored to Sight and
Cured of the Dread Diabetes.
wBPNDABBRa, Queensland, Crofxon Street,
May 3Ut, 1886. '.Three years ago, last January, I
was engaged in station life on the Koian River
miles north of Bundaberg. While working in th
ram one day I was seized with such violent pain
in my back that I was obliged to leave oif won
and go to my bed in camp. In about four or iiv
days my sight completely failed me. snd 1 cou
not see to do anything ; my thirst was im
mense, and I used to drink 36 quarts of water, tea
etc., a day (measured in a plnt-pannlcan), and ]
was unable to obtain slfeep. I came to Bundaberg
saw Dr. M., who said he could do me no good, anc
said I might as well make myself content and g
back to camp, for I was sure to go stone blind
My employer, Mr. D. F. Johnstone, of Kola
Station, advised me to go to Sydney and see Dr B
a leading eye specialist. I did so. After makin
an examination which differed from those pre
viously made as to the nature of my disease h
analysed my urine and told me that I was suffer
ing from Diabetes. He prescribed for me and
came back to Bundaberg, took his medicine, bu ;
found no re ief, and my sight got worse, and I wa
getting weaker and weaker. I next consulted two
other doctoas, with no better results, I then wen
under Dr. C., of Bundaberg, and still I continued
to tail. I then gave up all hopes of getting better
having tried so many medicines, and having spent
over £6OO in the vain pursuit of health, and made
1 vas told by my medical advisers,
that f ha,d to die. I thought if that was the ease
like to see my friends in hnglacd whilst I
still had life, and thought a sea voyage would be
beneficial. (I accordingly left with my family, and
arrived in Staffordshire about the middle of last
year.) I was induced to go to Queen’s Hospital,
Birmingham, and was treated by five different
doctors, who also informed me that J had the
dread Diabetes. They presciibed, and I was an
out-door patient of the hospital for five weeks I
tO . De P hew - who resides in
Rochester, New York, the nature of my complaint.
He wrote to me telling me of the wonderful cures
effected there by Warner’s Bafe Diabetes Cure.
He inquired ana found I could get the medicine
an ?, S3n t m r e a copy of “ The American
Rural Home, of November 39tb, containing
testimonials and descriptions of medicine. I then
f^«S 1 p edt S.* iFe J t * atetal *“ d Ken * to London
for the Remedies. 1 took nine bottles Warner’s
Diabetes Cure, and three vials Warner’s
Safe Pills. 1 then felt great y relieved and a
changed man, and I could see to read a newsoaper
I determined to return to Queensland, firmly be-
lieving myself a cured man. B aing unable to take
a supply of medicine with me on the voyage, about
of e m a e B W t ee fl kB ? fter last bottle, symptoms
of Diabetes returned and I wrote home to England
for more medicine. Accidentally, while coming
HP tbemainstreet of Bundaberg, ou the 7th March,
1886,1! saw Warner s Sai'e Remedies for sale in
Mr. Timms , our local chemist’s, window I gladlv
bought Warner’s Safe Diabetes Cure and again
continued its us*. As a result, lamab eto resume
my former work, and I can do as good a day’s
woTkasever. y weight was reduced to nine
stone, now I weigh over eleven. I cannot recom-
mend Warners Safe Remedies too highly, ts
they alone cured me of blindness and snatched mo
from the gTave, when all else failed.'’

A theatre during an afternoon perform-
ance is a dreary spectacle. It is suggestive of a
catacomb with the roof taken elf, or a ball which
has been prolonged till the check of virgin beauty
has grown haggard, and the ice-creams have
melted, axd the rouge on the face of aged youth
has become a mockery In the early twilight. The
firas lights struggle in an unequal contest with the
sunbeams that creep in through the closed blinds,
the artificial night seems like a demon prematurely
born, and the actors who tread the stage are op-
pressed by the consciousness that they are sup-
porting a double Dart and trying to metamorphose
not only themselves but Father Time as well.
But with all these disadvantages, the amateur
company who played “Our Boys” at the Sydney
Gaiety on Saturday afternoon lor the benefit of
the Ly-ee-moon lued scored a decided success-
At the commencement they were nervous,
as amateurs generally are. Sir Geoffrey
Champneys was preternaturally stiff ; the but-
terman dropped his aspirates In a refreshing
shower at one moment and relapsed into re-
fined English the next; and Aunt Clarissa,
though uniformly good, seemed to wish she were
somewhere else. But the entrance of the two
young ladles, who seemed thoroughly at home
from the outset, broke the spell. The baronet in-
serted an extra joint In his spine, Perkin Middle-
wick rallied his disorganised vocabulary, the
maiden aunt plucked up spirit, and made love to
the retired plg-and-baoon contractor with good
will and energy, and “ Our Boys ” arrived and set
everything going. The way in which the pair
bounced their respective parents made the comedy
almost a certain success, and at the end of the
'second act Mr. Cohen, transformed for the time
Into a raging, roaring, raving butterman, put the
result beyond all question. We have seen that
butterman In the same scene under many different
aspects. Sometimes he Is represented as bitterly
sarcastic; sometimes he is quietly vindictive, like
the hoop of one of his own butter-tubs when
you tread on It and It rises and strikes
you on the gizzard as you traverse a dark
lane at night ; but in hia rampant fury
last Saturday, he was more like the butter-
man who pervades this wicked world, and sells Im-
ported tallow a* pure country produce, than any
tradesman we have hitherto seen. In the last
scene the two flabby Roman fathers were very
good, and If the lady cousins missed ore or two
points this was compensated by the vivacity of
the lodging-house slavey—a young lady who need
never be out of a billet, and who could find about
B hundred Sydney boarding-houses where her ser-
vices would be at a premium. Our boys were
also at their best, in their humble quarters, in the
“three-pair back,” and the performers well
deserved the applause awarded them.
* ♦ *
The presence of the Governor and an array
of notables lent an aristocratic aspect to the scene,
but it might have been better if a number cf
dusty gods had not kept up a constant entrance
and exit in order to feast their eyes on the rear
elevation of his Excellency. A Baron, so far as
the hind view 1* concerned, is very like any other
man, and those who took so absorbing an interest
In his beck-hair might have kindly remembered
that they were rendering the dialogue quite in-
audible. As for the lady who remarked audibly,
" My, ain t he ’orrld I”—though we are quite un-
able to guess to whom she referred—it might be
well if she refrained from uttering such senti-
ments in presence of a loyal audience. No doubt
she was speaking the naked truth—indeed, to
judge from her dress she prefers it as nearly naked
as possible—but a little truth goes a long way in
Sydney.
** * *
“Duty Bound,” at Sydney Opera House,
Is a four-act comedy-drams, which is not calcu-
lated to raise a blush above anybody’s shirt-front.
The characters consist principally of two charm-
ing girls, a caddish young man with a taste for
Vice, a good young man with a taste for sermonis-
ing. two old British merchants, of whom one ;is
pulpy and the other slimy, and a truly dreadful
old woman. She is mean, grasping, narrow-
minded, cantankerous, sublimely mendacious, as
vicious as a buli-scorplon, as unreliable as a church
synod, and fearfully and wonderfully selfish.
When she speaks to her husband, that unhappy
man gives at the base of the spine instantly and be-
comes limp as a sun-killed crayfish, while her slangy
son retreats and the two young ladles hide them
selves in terror. The good young man, however,
stands his ground. In dramas of this kind the
good man and hia wicked relative are easily dis-
tinguished. The collar of depravity is more pro-
minent, and it is stiffened by the starch of pride
until It prods itself into the ears that are closed
against admonition. The vicious dicky is wide as
a whited sepulchre and deep as toe Yale of
Hinnom, and the corner of a sinful handker-
chief protrudes from the tail pocket of the
unrighteous coat. The good man is shorter,
stouter, and a little older, his moral waistcoat is
closely buttoned up, as it to hide the passionate
earnestness of his buigy necktie, and he plants his
pegged boots firmly on the hydra head of moral
corruption. The attractive young lady, with great
depth of character, is dressed plainly, with a small
bustle; the equally attractive, though frivolous
lady, is dressed elegantly, with a large bustle;
and the vicious old female is generally a rainbow,
in which a lurid cholera tint predominates. As
for the henpecked husband, he looks as if he had
engaged a cyclone for his valet, and seemingly toe
airy menial has attended strictly to his duties, and
never takes an evening out.
* * *
There is not much action in the early part
of the piece, and very little towards the end. In
the middle there is almost none. The heroine, a
young Creole, is ‘‘sassed” by her guardian, the can-
tankerous old lady, and responds at times with
such spirit that the stout female almost wishes
she had never been born. Tne son discourses
slangy language, makes love, and brings in cups
of coffee; the preud father quakes behind a news-
paper, and the good young man pays a visit,
blossoming forth like a lovely oasis in a barren
land. The old lady spreads slanders about the
heroine as the story progresses and destroys her
character, till at last she resolves to seek a new
home; the old man puts down his paper apolo-
getically and goes bankrupt, and the slangy son
falls off his horse into a ditch. Finally the good
young man restores the shattered fortunes of the
henpecked merchant and constitutes himself the
craole girl's guardian. The cad calls on him, and,
after explaining his errand in terse and business-
like language, be briefly hits the virtuous man in
tha eye. For a moment it seems as if vice is about
to triumph, and there is an awe-stricken hush,
during which the fall of an alligator might be
heard in any part of the house. But in another
second the good man has recovered his self-con-
trol, and he explains to his visitor that he is his
long-lost brother, and cries out in noble anguish
that he has been biffed on the nose and has
not returned the Insult. Both weep, the man
with the sound conscience and the damaged nose
shedding tears on his blotting-pad, while the cad
snuffles remorsefully into the stiff corner of his
collar. Finally a profound and holy calm irrigates
the scene, the vicious lady is suppressed and
crushed flat, the good characters—four of them—
are all engaged to be married, the cad revives,
calls the virtuous man a fool and a coward and
then gives him his blessing, and by a merciful
dispensation of Providence all is over.
♦ * *
“Duty Bound” is one of the best fossil
sermons that has come under our notice for a long
time. It would be impossible to cram one more
moral lesson into it without imminent danger of
bursting the hide of the drama, and even as
ip.tne high-toned Sunday-school sentiment
which actuated the writer bulges out in
all directions like the fat streaks in an
over-fed hog. The acting all round Is as good as
circumstances permit, but the play hangs like a
millstone round everybody’s neck, and chloro-
forms the audience Into silent stupor. Mr. Reeve
makes the very best that can be made of the vir-
tuous man, but the character in question is of no
use except to the undertaker; and Mr. Brian
Barley acts the slangy cad with the easy grace of
a who Is at home In his part. But the ladies
with the exception of Mrs. Bryer, who Is un-
speakably vixenish—succumbed to the saddening
atmosphere of the piece, and the lmpr?sslon they
left on the audience was that they were tired and
wanted to go to bed, a desire ia which all present
heartily concurred.
** * *
‘‘His Natural Life” is still on the boards
at Sydney Royal Standard. When we observe the
crowds who attend nightly to witness this gory
drama a great financial idea strikes us, and we see
our way to abolish ad valorems and wipe out the
chronic dt licit In the Treasury of NS. W. Let all

slightest difficulty. The only feature in the convict
drama to which the public object is the decomposed
moral. The convlctism is applauded, the cannibal
is greeted with enthusiasm, the “ cat-o'-nine-talla”
gets an encore, and villainy in general is well re-
ceived. But in public executions of the kind sug-
gested there is no moral whatever, so this objec-
tion would be obviated. No free passes, of course,
would be allowed, as the great object would be to
make money, but a reduction might be made
to Sunday schools, and bank shareholders could
be admitted at half-price while the manager was
under treatment.

The new programme of the Federal Min-
strels, at Sydney Academy, has not as yet resulted
la crowded houses. Some of the company’s jokes
are hoary and bald from extreme old age, aad many
of them seem to be translations from the Egyp-
tian epitaphs on the tombs of Thebes. When we
remember that the Hebrew David was a minstrel,
we cannot but sympathise with Sauls failure to
spike him with his javelin, and we are half inclined
to regret that the use of that valuable weapon is

‘ Struck Oil” still draws at the Sydney
JtCoyal. After making allowances for the parsoni-
«hi,o 6 t* up of Eben Skinner, the
character was. It must be admitted, ably given.
Its weakest part was its finish. It was quite In
kecpsng for the sanctimonious knave to assume,
when bowled out, the role of a martyr, but the
assumption was worked out without the delicate
touches which might have made Skinner’s depar-
ture a piece of artistic portraiture. It blurted
itself out. Bben proclaimed his own innocence,
charged those about him with conspiracy, and ex-
pressed assurance that his virtue would yet
triumph, and these things were done with tone
and bearing walch left nothing of the fine
hypocrisy suggested by other aspects of the
character. Instead of departing defiantly,
boisterously, the deoeitfulness, treachery,
and prominent cowardice displayed by him
in the early stages should have ended in
a meek, submissive acquiescence in a fate
which he could have shown more by silence
than by speech was wholly, in his own esti-
mation, unmerited by him. To illustrate, take
Mr. Anson’s appearance before the curtain in
answer to vociferous calls on one occasion. The
excellence of his acting was testified to by a
tempest of hoots and groans. He held the black
hat in his hand, turned much of the white parts of
his eyes up at the hooters, and letting the eye-
lashes fall as if in forgiveness, shook his head pen-
sively and resignedly, and retired with the bearing
of an incorruptible but totally misunderstood
man. That was the essence of the character.
There was rich suggestiveness in it while it held
together thus. The change to the braggart, the
all-rouud accuser, the loud declaimer of his own
virtue, and the new manner and tone the change
™a e J?+v. tat6d vulgarised the original conception
and otherwise deteriorated it.

while following It. It is, of course, plunging to
suggest a comparison between “Struck Oil” and
genius. We do it, however, with a purpose. It
seems to us that high dramatic excitement, in-
stead of mere homely charm, might be developed
by making Skinner the playwright's fulcrum in-
stead ot John Stofel. John is an excellent back-
ground against which to play oif a strong and emi-
nently wicked character. In making him the sole
hero, the world is for the time turned into a
neighbourhood such as Richardson, Cowper, or
Martin Tupper might have created. It is to Mr.
Anson much of these redactions is due. His
acting projected phases of his part which were, in
dramatic excellence, far ahead of his text.

We conclude, therefore, that a paper may now-
give social news and be„“ respectable.” Wo read
that “the Messrs, Fairfax” have added a new
department for the publication of “Society news.»

this Information Is shown by the increasing lr»
forest which Is manifested in their paper by ad
sections of the public.” A year ortwoagoTnE
Bulletin was denounced by the S.M, Herald in
a co'umn of editorial cant and snivel fordoing—
sLly in a neater way-what the Herald pro-
prietary now find it necessary to advertise that
they have commenced. What’s the world coming
to ? When next the Rev. Dr. Jefferis stands up and
absurdly snuffles over “papers which invade the
sanctity,” &j, we hope he’ll not forget to expli-
citly mention, in the presence of theuncertlflcated
saints of his congregation, that the Sydney Mail
now does it—that they all do it, in fact. After all,
a report of the modern parson’s sermon is only
“ Society ” news. Is there anyone in Australia so
hypocr'tloal as to pretend to think that the
Herald accounts of the Jtfferlsun and Fraokk-
tonian jeremiads upon “Bichelor Life,” and
“ Spinster Life,” and “ How to Woo,” and “ Chris-
tian Courtship,” and all the rest of If, are anj-
thing but “ Society ” news ? For our own part
we are so unregenerate as to solemnly believe that
a lot of the antique virgins with winter faces, blue
noses, and corkscrew curls, who listen to the
galimatias of the good Congregational pastor and
his Presbyterian brother in the Lord, approach their
respective fanes with no feeling more reverential
than that with which they approach 4 o’clock
scandal and tea.

THE LAND OF THE CROCODILE.
(BY MAROOGALINE. )
A well-known man in Queensland is W.
O. Hodgklnson, sometime goldfields warden and
now relieving police magistrate. He was a great
favourite with the diggers, and is a genial and
honest representative of the true Australian
democracy. He was once stationed at Ravens-
wood, and on the occasion of some festivit
among the population the whisky supply of t
town was exhausted. And from the whole of t
Inhabitants a prayer went up to Heaven or dow

Hodgklnson was aware that the local banker kepi

festive friends suddenly appeared under the ban

worth of gold specimens obtained from a new re
They were bound to deposit them in the bank tb
night. The manager arose and opened the ban
parlour, placed the bag of splendid specime
carefully in the safe, and then all hands eat dow
and spent the balance of the night in drinkln
success to the new reef, and general joy and glo
to the universe. And about iOo’clock on the folio
ing mornlrg the bank manager rose from h
couch on the carpet, opened the safe to look ai
the wondrous specimens, ana found a bag co
talng twenty pounds of nlcely-a?sorted rose
metal I And the prospectors were gone, and
was all the bank whisky I And Hodgklnson th
day received notice that his account was ove
drawn six and ninepence and that an
mediate settlement was peremptorily requested

Warden Sellhtim was on his way back
Cooktown from the Palmer. He pulled up at
small creek to consume a tin of sardines and dilu
the contents of his flask. He found a party
diggers cooking at a huge Are and one of them w
just dusting a cooked damper which he had r
moved from the ashes. “ This appears to be
favourite camping-place, matel” said one of th
men to Sellbeim. "ch no,” replied the warder
“this is no camping ground! Where you a

Frank was a resident of Rockhampton
His brother was manager of the Queenslanc
National Bank. Frank nad one flxea ambitio
that transcended ail his other desires, and that wa
to shoot a crocodile. Bo he and a party were om
one day on a tributary of the Fiizroy, looking
round for a specimen of the noble saurian witi
the “ flue open countenance I” And they saw on
about 18ft. long lying on a mud-flat on the oppo-
site bank, but he gilded gently into the water an
disappeared. There was an overhanging tree
with a lower branch about six feetabovethe creek
Frank stationed himself on this commanding
position, and, pointing bis rifle in readiness, waiter
calmly for the crocodile to come up. And th
crocodile did come up very unexpectedly, and in
very unexpected locality. He rose right under
Frank, with a roar like that of a mad bison, and hi
mouth sufficiently open to take in a railway-truck
full of sheep. And Frank dropped his rifle into
the creek, turned to the colour of a snowball
crawled back off the tree, regained his comrades
and whispering hoarsely, “give me some rum,’
fainted peacefully away. When he recovered, his
first words were: “ Henceforth I leave crocodile
hunting to madmen 1 I shall confine my shooting
in future to grasshoppers. Let us strike for
home I”

And this reminds me that W. C. Smith
late manager of the Q.N. Bank in Cairns, and Johr
Upward, now in business in Sydney, once started
from Cairns in Bob Boy canoes to go up the
Barron River to Sm.thfleld. Plutonian darkneis
had descended when they entered the mouth oi
the river, but they padded cheerfu ly away into
the inky night between the overhar ging man-
groves unconscious of danger. At the first bend
they dimly d stinguished, a few yards ahead, what
appeared to be a floating log. Smith gave it
playful dab with his paddle and the “log’’gave
one mad plunge, threw up a few tons oi
water, and plunged into the depths below. It was
a crocodile of unusually robust dimensions. Then
the two canoeists came close together, crept along
near the shore, and started singing to rouse their
somewhat despondent spirits. They sang all the
way to Smitblieid, songs sacred and prolane, in
evtry key that ever the human voice commanded
The nature of these midnight vocal efforts may
be feebly ascertained from the fact that no croco-
dile was seen in the Barron for six months, the
blacks acquired a superstitious dread of the river,
and the shores next morning were strewn with
defunct fish, their faces clearly indicative of death
from iright. And when Smith and Upward
reached Smith field they bad not sufficient aiticu-
lation left to order medicinal stimulants. They
had to address the hotel-keeper in mute but
elcquently-expresslve gestures. And they retired
to rest murmuring, “nsrrosh kape shocrodiles,
shalligatore, moosic too mush for’em; sphlendid
idea-hooray 1“

One more anecdote of Tom Brown, of
Bavenswood. A German digger had died and was
burled with his clothe s on. Tom told some fellow a
afterwards that the German had a belt with 300
sovereigns in it, and that this was buried with the
body. This wts one of Tom’s little larks. He
knew the men he was talking to. They went
away and had a long consultation, the result of
which was that three of them interviewed Tom
late on the following night, and Intimated to him
their arxious desire to resurrect the German.
Tom pretended to approve of the business, and
they left with a promise to call for him the follow-
ing midnight. At that particular time a buggy
drove up, and two men, batted and cloaked like
Italian bandits, and looking the personification of
abandoned ruffianism, walked to Brown’s room,
lorn was supposed to know the exact position of
the grave. He saw the business was acquiring
a serious aspect, so he told them that it was use-
less to make the attempt as he could never find
•• w spot. And one of the bandits said,
well, if you can tell within five or six yards, we
can paddock off the ground I” And the other
Ba y. “will have that German up if we
paddock off the whole darned cemetery J” They
were men not easily discouraged I But Tom
said he was too ill to go out that night and that
the project must be postponed. And It is un-
necessary to say that the German, with the purely
imaginary belt of sovereigns, has been sleeping
peacefully in his grave up to the present time.

The scene was at Cooktown, in the Palmer
days, when there was a crowd of diggers waiting
to get away by the first steamer. Genial old Cap-
tain M‘Lean came alongside, in the Leichhardt.

GOODMAN (cautiously): “WELL, I’LL SPEAK TO ONE OF THE FIRM. IN ANY CASE

The steamer was rushed by the diggers, and they
led off with a quiet but resolute attack on the
cook’s galley. The cabin passengers were re-
duced to a sumptuous banquet of boiled potatoes,
smuggled in by one of the stewards. Before the
steamer started the captain paraded all the diggers,
to obtain their passs ge-money. Most of them paid

The Rev. W. Kildabl recently resigned the
incumbency of Christ Chuich, Milton, near Bris-
bane. This reverend gentlemen, a very genial and
liberal theologian, was once travelling on the
Bogan in New South Wales with a squatter for a
companion. On the road, Kildahl shot a large
white-headed eagle and hung him by the feet to
the crupper staple. And thus they rode along
SECOND ACT.
(Goodman’s little note).
until the squatter, who was riding ahead, heard a
sudden series of unearthly yells from the rear,
and on looking round saw his clerical companion
gesticulating frantically, his gun on the ground
and the horse executing a wild fantasia on two
legs. And all this disturbance arose from the fact
that the wounded eagle had unexpectedly re-
turned to sensibility, and signalised his recovery
by seizing Kildahl firmly by the calf of the leg
with the evident intention of making a hasty
lunch. When the eagle's head had been cut off and
his jaws opened to release the leg. Kildahl re-
turned thanks to the Great Giver of ail good for
his miraculous deliverance. The bird was pro-
bably a Roman eagle temporarily possessed by the
spirit of Torouemada. and hence his demoniac
desire to chaw’up the Protestant evangelist.
The Murray ia a

is the Dariirg, in an
even more hilarious de-
gree. We read in the
Bourke papers of steam-
ers that have been wait-
ing on these noble
streams for periods vary-
ing from 13 months to
three years to be able to
move out of the mud.
In some cases the ves-
sels have been used as
Gchoolhouses, and in one
instance one of them was
turned into a Town Hali.
When it leaves, the
mayor and aldermen will
have to hold their meet-
ings in a cave, or go back
to the blacksmith s. The
departure of these ves-
sels is naturally looked
upon by the Inhabitants
of the township to which
they have lent a sub-
stantial and prosperous
appearance so long, in
the light of a griev-
ance. It is not easy
to be philosophic when
people see their pub-
lic buildings vanishing
slowly out of view. The leave-taking' of the cap-
tains and crews is said, by these who have wit-
nessed It, to be a pathetic sight. Some of them
have settled down and married, and gathered a
family around them while they have been waiting
there for the river to rise. They are saddened at
parting by the thought that they may never live
to return, or that If they do, they may find them-
selves Eip Van Winkles, meeting new faces and a
new generation that does not know them from
Mcthusaleh. “ One more old landmark gone,” said
an ancient resident of one of those riverside vil-
lages, as a steamer he had known from childhood
swung out into the river the other day. And then
he burst into tears, and had to be loaded up with
beer before he would be quiet. There is a hote’-
keeper away out there who had a consignment of
timber sent him from a South Australian port by
a river steamer three years ago. He wanted it to
fix up his hotel to keep the rain out. If be has
not put the hotel on a raft he Is ■ robably drowned
by this time. The timber may come In bandy to
make him a coffin- If his body has been d’scovered
He was terribly “chippy.” While in his
tub he held conversations with people who be
thought w»ro in his bedroom. In deserted streets
he fancied he heard people shouting out his name
to him. Although be bad mentally sworn off, he
flew into his pet place and demanded bis life to be
saved. The cork of the soda- water bottle had got
broken, and they were a bit slow over the life-
saving, when a perfect stranger earns up to him,
and, tapping him on the shoulder, asked: “As
from one gentleman to another gentleman, will
you tell me whether I have been keeping up
Christmas or Ihe Queen’s Jubilee ?”
Oncb a Month, according to the Mel-
bourne correspondent of the Sydney D.T., “ an-
nounces that it must give up the ghost unless
some wealthy patron or patrons of colonial litera-
ture come to the rescue with guarantees of £lOO-
- a very iroprobab'e contingency indeed. And
yet they could not spend a £lOO-note to better ad-
vantage, for Once a Month is beyond all question
the ablest periodical that Victoria has yet pro-
duced. Its typography was excellent; Its literary
matter entertaining; and its engravings really ad-
mirable. For style and finish they have not been
equalled or excelled by any of the home maga-
zines. It is a great pity that so good
a periodical should be allowed to drop for
want of proper support.” This is one of the
calmest announcements we have ever read. Onch
a Month is or was a mild little publication edited
by the Rev. Peter Mercer, all that can be said for
whom is that be displayed literary judgment just
a shade better than toat of the average parson.
In Once a Month you never saw anything that
would bring a blush to the maiden’s cheek, or
make the old man suddenly get up, jumn on his
spectacles, and proceed to burn the Monthly
Merger wilh the aid of the Are-tongs. But, again,
you never read anything in the godly little Pres-
byterian f hilling's worth that caused you to choke
with laughter, or cry with emotion, or thunder
with rage like that of a New Zealand earthquake.
It was well prit ted, its literary matter was enter-
taining—to the clergy ard tbe stall-holders at
church-bazaars—ard its engravings were pretty
good lithos which would have done credit to, say,
Melbourne Punch. Of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven.

There is at least one happy Christian
family at Adelpng, N.S.W. Their address is at the
vicarage, and life In that bower of h;iss seems to
be summed up in one sentence: “ Who’ll tread on
the tail of me coat?” Within the last few days a-
grand washing of dirty surplices in public has
taken place, and four ordinary Js.P. have assisted
at the show, Mrs. Soares swears that her reverend
husband pulled her out of bed twice, hurt her
severely, and threatened her with bis fists, simply
because she told him bis language was only fit for'
a pot-home; that her son rang the dinner bell in
her face, and, finally, that a family syndicate, con»-
sisting of half the Soares family, threw her out
into the hall and forced her to take refuge In flight
and hysterics. The Rev. G. Scares, a clerk in holy
orders, (which, we presume, means a sort of
anointed cashier,) swears, on the other hand, that
the trouble arose because Mrs. Soares called her-
daughter various things, including “a low, pot-
house girl,” and tore that young lady’s dress
to shivers. The daughter and the other
members of the family endorse this view<
of the case, and all combine in describing
Mrs. Soares as a lady with a temper like that
of an old bull-goat, and a profound and holy
disregard for veracity. It appears from their
statements that she was not kicked out into the
hall; on the contrary, she kicked herself out and
screamed while she was doing it, and when once
outside she shrieked on the verandah and departed
from the truth on the front steps, uniil the neigh-
bourhood was in an uproar. The swearing on both.)
sides of the case was hard and numerous, but no-
thing came of it. The J.’sP., who never quailedi
before a “drunk and disorderly,’’ or shirked their
duty in a cow-trespass case, found themselves
utterly unable to deal with all this cross evidence,
and were content at last to utter a few plaintive
platitudes and dismiss the charge. Life must be a.
happy affair in the vicarage at Adelong.
TO "JAMES MANCHESTER.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Thus the London Dispatch:— “ What will
the Manchester teetotallers say to Bishop Moor-
house? He has scarcely arrived in England be-
fore he launches treason against the principle ot
total abstinence. He was once a teetotaller, he
says, but his health gave way, and he bad tochoose
between total abstinence and work. But for his
decision In favour of work he would not now be
B'shop of Manchester. This direct association of
bishoprics and the bottle will make the blue rib-
bon flutter on many agitated bosoms.” Will make
it flutter off many agitated bosoms, if we know
snjthlrg. Let us mingle prayer and praise with
the solemn notes of the sackbut belonging to this
Journal:—
Bishop Moorhouse, our hand I Pray accept It—
We ourselves also once s'gned the pledge,
And for fourteen days manfully kept it,
Till we found our back-teeth all *' on edge
Till we found our soul turned inlo acid.
And our “ innards ” remorseful and sore,
And cur heart, which was hitheito placid,
Filled with infinite yearnings for Gore.
We were stranded that year In a torrid
Ar d thirsty town, out in the West,
And the girl had brown bangs on her fore head,
And. dear Bishop, you know all the rest;
We were madly and frightfully smitten
With this maid who wore badges of blue,
And who wouldn't look towards us one bit in
The world, until we wore them too.
What would you have done, Bishop ? What we did
Ws sto y leld. We cried c ut, “ Who’s afraid ?
Other men from Drink’s band have seceded,”
And strolled down to the lodge, and got “made.”
Bishop 1 you have been weanedfrom strong waters
And gone back to ’em. You never went.
In your youth, to the “ Dawn of Day Daughters,”
At the “Hope of Bigorrabi Tent.”
If you'd “ been in the swim,” as the slang goes—
If you'd reached the real Temperance blits
That breaks out in teetotal fandangoes,
And in many a far-sounding kiss—
If you’d swung in a wild swing ecstatic.
Where Jack grasps a quite different “gill,”
Would your conduct have been so erratic—
Would you not be for Abstinence still ?
But, when you were a “ tote.” things were slower;
Then a plucked brand would often return
To the brands that his soul loved, and so err
As to make the good brotherhood mourn,
Till they recognised this potent fact, if
Their power was to reach near and far
They must make life almost as attractive
In a Lodge as it is in a bar.
We digress. From the sad ranks of swipers
We were lifted, washed clean, and set free.
But, alasl most young females are vipers,
And our girl loved a W.C.
(Worthy Chief, gentle reader) with fervour,
And had won us away from Bhe-oak,
Kot for love, but in order to serve her
Ghastly Order, and rivet its yoke
Upon one whom she loved as a brother,
But “could never, etcetera”—her guile—
(We are here slipping out for another
Just to soothe us). Her conduct was vile
(We trie d w hisky, your l?rdship)— y es, d her I
She Jlst had us completely—but there.
We must certainly try to be calmer,
One may drink, but must surely not swear.
But she did not at once undeceive us,
For a week or so ail went on well;
Yet, ob, Bishop, you’d never believe ua
If we ventured to truthfully tell
What we suffered that week from barbaric.
Strange drinks—t hings that rise up and seethe,
Liquors baleful, with acids tartaric,
That are even as a file on the teeth.
Things that nip their oold way down men’s
throttles—
Drinks of strange and malevolent hues.
Pent in all sorts of evil-shaped bottle s
That are corkless, and wholly refuse
To stand up, as an honest flask will do,
But lie down while their chained venoms hiss
As though saying, “ We lie here and mildew,
While men live, lacking our icy kiss I ”
Ah, that week I An Insatiate and vital
Fiery thirst held us down. What avail
Would it be to give here a recital
That would quickly make brave cheeks turn
pale ? %
We wete ten times more valiant than Hector., wl
In the cause; we absorbed ginger wine '
By the quart, and “ Bigorrabi Nectar”
We declared—with a groan-was divine.
We qui ffed goblets of mud-coloured Tonic,
We swigged gallons of harsh Orangeade,
While our smile became fell and sardonic.
And our soul sought the regions of shade.
Then we said to ourselves, “Old man, cheer up,
You’ll get used to all this in the end;
What you want now is Pine Apple Syrup,
And Pie-Melon—teetotallers’ friend.”
But alas, we were weak. We had reckoned
Overmuch on our strength. Like a Man
We got through the first week—through the
- second I
Like a Fiend. In our arteries ran q
Molten Are, and revenge, and a craving j if
For all acids, and bloodshed, and gas— I**
So we sought her. She said we were raving, <-
And rejected us, boldly as brass I
And we slew her. Laid within the same tomb is
Her beloved Worthy Chief—now a Past—
And from us the thick mantle of gloom is
Lifted, o’er us no more to be cast—
We drank largely of rum, and the nitre,
And the scorn left our heart; and of beer.
Quite three times the contents of your mitre.
And cur brain became thoroughly clear.
And we rolled in a flood, like the Tiber’s,
Of schnapps, and wrote columns of rhymes,
Which drove away both the subscribers
From our rag, the Bigorrabi Times;
Then, perceiving the wise and the witty
In the bush are as lost, we cried quits.
And set out in the night for the city
Where the papers keep poets ana wits.
There, of course, we found swift recognition.
And no mortal who looks on us now,
Lending grace to a haughty position,
Would believe that we once made a vow
r Bo abstain from good liquor. The boys on
The staff have no reason to think
That we ever went back on our “ poison,”
Or were heard to say “ No ” to a drink.
Yes! we’ve been on the Temperance racket.
And we’ve failed; and we stoutly maintain
That ’twould need six strong men and a “Jacket,”
And a syringe, to make us again
Taste those terrible drinks that we quaffed at
In the frenzy of ardour new-born.
Till our poems were publicly laughed at,
And our “ locals ” regarded with scorn.
Now, we’ve told you, dear Bishop, concisely.
All about our one little mistake;
You’ll be fatherly, won’t you ? and nicely
Advise us in what brands to slake
Our tyrannical thirst. Is it risky,
Do you And, to write sermons on gin ?
Do you take that, or patronise whisky
When you need strength to preach against sin ?
Do you plunge your episcopal beak in
A tankard of Bass’s, before
You go on with mien lowly, and meek in
The steps of the Lord you adore ?
Kindly tell yourtexperience. We’re sure it
Will give comfort and guidance “ to all,”
And full many a toil-stricken curate
Who may listen in vain for a call
From the Lord to a better-paid billet.
Where the saving of souls rakes in wealth.
Will produce his tin measure, and fill it,
And drink gladly your Lordship’s good health I
Let us know—we are panting to know it—
If the drink that a bishop Imbibes,
Is the right sort to give to a poet ?
Does it act upon saints as on scribes ?
We have turned out “ Plain English ” on tots of ;
The rum of the North, and lull oft
For our leader have ordered six pots of
Colonial, and raised them aloft;
We have written, sustained by dark brandy,
Biting “Denominational Drops”
(When we’d none ot our own liquor handy
We’d sneak into the studio for “ flop s ”).
What’s your verdict on potheen ? Pray give it;
It inspires us v ith “ Pepper and Salt.”
As for verge—when we re charged with Glenlivet,
Never once does our ardent muse halt;
“ Sporting Items,” tnd records rf slaughter.
And all screed of a similar kind.
We pro uce upcn Botany water,
Which inflames and unhinges the mind.
Thai s how we do. By next mail Inform us.
Good Bishop, what drinks you think best
To Inspire Uo, and urge us, and warm us;
Also tell us, we humbly request,
Jubt how lur may each one be Indulged in
Without risking our soul—don’t forget—
Though Tis do.ted and damaged, and bulged in—
We are wtak. a'>o have hope for it yet.

On the first page of this day’s irsue of The

evidence in this matter? *s an ex-Oahtnet Minister
is openly alleged to be implicated, the public are
naturally suspicious «s to the nature of the treat-
ment of his case. It is very wrong, the public
should not be suspicious, but they are so, never-
theless.
As usual, the distribution of titles to the
colonists has been productive of very much dis-
satisfaction. The elevation of tin Rt. Hon. W. B.
Dailey will be gencrslly applauded, but colonial
Radicals will regard Graham Berry’s knighthood
as the price of his political conscience. Mr, B oslsto
refuses to u?e the letters C M.G. after his name.
No doubt he takes them to mean “Gan Manufac-
ture Gum-oil”—a tribute to his one life work.
Considering that the Queen specially admired the
eucalyptus oil at the Exhibition (vide London cor-
respondent’s letter in the Sydney D.T.) Mr.
Bosisto should have got a dukedom at the very
least.
The front Opposition benches in the
N.B.W. Assembly, on Tuesday night, were one
lurid glow of Orangeism. Sir Heaary Parkes was
at the cost of honour, and near him sat the “ Pro-
testant ascendancy ” crowd Lloyd, Foster,
Abigail, Clarke, and the others of the same fac-
tion. Sir Henry has, doubtless, made a satisfac-
tory explanation about the Home Rule business
t > Mr. Abigail, so it will be “ me and Parses ”
again with the little dictator. Messrs. Heydon,
0 Sullivan, and Kidd have gone to the Opposition
cross-benches with the object of acting as balance-
weight to the main parties in the House. Their
.party does not appear very terrible so far, but the
brow of the O’Sullivan Is portentous of future
triumphs.
The South Australian Budget Speech of
Tuesday night shows that the deficit now
totals £853 897. This is is not quite up to the New
South Wales million and a quarter, but consider-
ing that, including even Chinamen, there are only
819,769 persons in the younger colony as against a
million “Walers,”the South Australian balance
must really be considered a fairly reasonable thing
in the way of shortages. The previous Treasurer
had an intermission of something like half-a-
million in the public accounts in December last,
and the present balance Is just £355 300 ahead of
what he estimated that it would be. Financial
prophecies don’t appear, judging by this instance,
to be a more re iable article in Adelaide than they
are in Sydney. Expenditure for next year, with
the present shortage added, will amount to
£3,066 953, and the probable revenue is stated at
£3,114 934, leaving a gap of £953,039 which Mr. Bray
(significant name I) proposes to stuff up by
new probate and stamp duties, by levying on
the Civil servants to the tune of £14,000, and by
selling their holdings to selectors who have re-
sided on them for six years. The present financial
statement is just what might be expected in S.A.
For saints and shortages that colony is nulli
seeundus.
The Bourke Abduction Case.
The jury who sat on the case of Father Huggard,
of Bourke, N.S.W., have finally decided that a girl
of tender yetrs Js one of the few worldly things
that a modern clergyman must not steal, and the
rev. father hss been found guilty of abduction in
consequence. It is gratifying to learn that the
clerical profession will have to draw the line some-
where. The parsers In general have full permis-
sion to embezzle the 13apostles, to misappropriate
the four Gospels and any more they cm lay their
hands upon, to finance upon the Mosaic law, and
to float the prophets Into a limited liability com-
pany, and they use this extended liberty to the
utmost, but beyond these bounds they must not go.
Father Huggard’s defence, however, showed that
his ideas of priestly power are rath* extensive.
Ho claimed a right in his professional capacity “ to
decide over the conscience of a child belonging t r
his flock,” and, no doubt, It come s within his scope
to influence the aforesaid conscience by inform-
ing its owner that Gehenna la chokefull of little
girls who refused to go into convents when on
earth. His concern even extended to the bodies
and sculs of the jurymen, and he pointed
out '(s a result of deciding against him
that they would make themselves “supremely
ridiculous in the eyes of the whole world I” And,
sad to say, Ihe jury have been and gone and done
exactly what the rev. gentleman ssld they would.
They have made themselves supremely ridiculous
by tacklrg on to their verdict of guilty a strong
recommendation to mercy, without stating its
grounds, and apparently their desire was that this
tonsured relic of ancient superttition should be at
once turned loose upon society, to indulge his per-
verted taste for saving the soul of young Austra-
lia in his own peculiar way. Why Father Haggard
deserves such consideration very few people will
understand. If be is a mete fanatic it might do
simply to ship him off to some land where the
market for this kind of zoological curiosity Is
more active, for in Australia fanatics are in weak
demand at something under 5 cents per dozen,
and are only quoted a fraction higher than Manx
cats. If he is a kleptomaniac, who fancies little
girls in place of watches and pocket-handker-
chiefs, let him be disposed of in a cool and shady
spot adapted to maniacs of that peculiar descrip-
tion. Aud if he is something less respectable than
either of the above, then he should be treated in
a manner at once less respectable and less respect-
ful. But why the jury imagine a man should be
allowed to insult and outrage the com-
munity simply because he has built up for
himself or allowed to be buL up for him,
a creed which calls on him to do so,
and yet go virtually unpunished, we cannot
Imagine. Certainly, no similar indulgence Is ex-
tended to others whose peculiar tenets may lead
them to borrow, not the daughters, but merely
the umbrellas, and other portable property of the
colonists. The Hindoo stranger, whose defalca-
tions go no further than taking possession of a
horse, gets no particular consideration, and yet
his doctrines teach him to believe the horse
possesses an Immortal soul, aud he may have taken
the animal with the pure intention of leading him
by the forelock into eternal life, or driving him
there in a spring van. The banking heathen who
takes what Is not hla’n, gets mercy enough, but
even Tie has a bad time of It In comparison with
the religious fanatic of the present day. Father
Huggard has certainly more cause to congratu-
late himself on his escape than if he bad dodged
being made a K.G.MG., or got away in safety
from a large and influential deputation which
wanted him to contest the Mudgee election; and
if a man of his stamp is capable of taking a lesson,
he will allow hisflock to run their own consciences
in future, and sand his hands with a view to get-
ting and keeping a firm grip on his own.
Isaac Lazars Nose.
The customary jewel-robbery is now in full swing
in England, and the bag of mysterious bones is
•topping up as usual in the Thames, but the mind
of man desires some more novel excitement,
and ail these things are vanity. The daily
bank forgery is also prospering, and the
dynamite prophet is prophesying with his
wonted accuracy, but the public demand
change and variety, and both have at last
been supplied by an extraordinary legal diffi-
culty—the problem of Isaac Lszar’s no~e, which is
the talk of London and a mine of wealth to the
journalists of Europe. The nose was of the tru&
Jerusalem breed, of a bay-horse colour, large,
mtllow, and trained by years of banking experi-
ence to poke into other people’s business, and it,
along with a bald bead, a harsh voice, a corpulent
figure six feet In height, a love of intoxicants,
good living, tobacco, cigars, and betting, and some
clothes, made up the personality of Isaac Lazar,
accountant In the Preston Joint Stock Bank!
Associated with him was another nose, of the
description which blossomed in front of Julluu
Cnesar when that immortal warrior rushed
on to victory, and the man to whom
this belonged used to sign his name—when
he wasn’t signing somebody else’s—as Percy
Whyte. He may be briefly described as a thin,
delicate, fair, red-curly-halred, total abstinence!
Sunday school teaching. Young Men’s Christian
Association, poetic, milk-and-soda-water young
gentleman, and his occupation was that of a
ledger-keeper. The dissppeararce of this pair
with £BO,OOO of the bank funds early in 1885,
created some little interest in polite circles, and a
reward of £4OOO was offered for their apprehension.
This resu’ted, 13 months’ later, in the arrest of
Hargrave and M'Crombie, Financial Agents, of
London, and on their trial the Identification was
complete except for one unhappy circumstance.
The senior partner of the firm was either Lazar
himself or his double, but he was wearing Whyte’s
nofe, while It was unanimously voted fhatM‘Crom-
bie was either Whyte or the devil In person, but
yet he stood calmly In the dock and blew an olfac-
tory organ exactly similar to the one Lazar was
wont to poke into other people's business when in
the employ of the Preston Joint Stock Bank, and
the very duplicate of that which the same Lazar
was accustomed to follow on his way home when
his duties were over for the day. Whyte, too, had
never smoked In his life, but yet the so called
Hargrave carried a dirty pipe all day beneath that
gentleman’s borrowed organ; he had never tasted
Intoxicants or used bad language, and yet his nose
In its new quarters neither recoiled nor shuddered
when Hargrave absorbed grog and ejected deep
bass profanity In Its immediate vicinity. On the
other hand, the prisoner who called himself
M'Crombie wes daily dipping L-zar’s debauched
Hebrew beak into milk and sodawater, and snuff-
ling Sunday-school prayers through a feature
which had hitherto inhaled tobacco-smoke rather
than the odour of sanctity, and been wiped in
the midst of wicked orgies by night and in the
bettirg-rine by day. These were strong points for
the d< fence, but the line followed by the prosecu-
tion damaged them considerably. A surgeon who
bad examined both prisoners pointed out that
each nose was surrounded by a scar, and after
quoting eases in support of his novel theory he
expressed the opinion that the prisoners had ex-
changed noses by the s'mple process of cutting
them off and refitting them in an unaccustomed
quattcr. The experiment had been remarkably
successful, but the traces of the operation re-
mained. Three other doctors supported this as"
tonisbing suggestion, and a photographer then
produced portraits of the prisoners, and by cut-
ting eff and transposing the noses changed them
into/acsimilesofthe photos, of the twomensomuch
wanted at Preston. Then arose a storm of wrath
and contempt from the lawyer for the defence.
Even his w s g bristled with scorn when he de-
manded whether this system of patching up bor-
rowed features might not be carried to its legiti-
mate conclusion by fixing Mr. Gladstone’s head,
choke-full of theories for the regeneration of Ire-
land, on the dissipated shoulders and depraved
legs of Theebaw, ex-King of Burmah, and then
placing the Asiatic monster on the Treasury
bench, and the Grand Old Man in cor flnement at
Madras; or whether it would be allowable to graft
the ever-retreating legs of Milan of Servia on to
the warlike stomach of the Prince of Wales. The
Judge confined himself to pointing out that the
prisoners possessed between them the noses and
other worldly possessions cf two noted criminals,
but heshliked one important question—whether l
in the event of Lazar being found guilty as the
principal, and Whyte merely as an accessory, it
would be justifiable to allow Whyte’s nose to
languish for years in a dungeon after Its owner’s
sentence hsd expired; while Lszar’s olfactory
organ, in spite of its load of guilt, would be en-
joying the sweets of freedom. The jury, how-
ever, probably saw this diffleu'ty, and failing to
come to a decision, they were discharged, so that
the twin noses will again blush at the bar of jus-
tice at next assizes—it is to be hoped with better
results. But one noteworthy circumstance has
seemingly been overlooked by every writer who
has discussed this ease, namely, that the Jew, as
usual, got the best of the bargain—he parted with
bis bloated Canaan itish excrescence, and secured
in exchange a genuine Christian proboscis.

SOCIALS
On last Monday (Coronation Day) H.E.
the Governor and Lady Carington held a recep-
tion at Government House, Sydney. As
usual, everything was in the best style,
and the band played admirably. Among
those present were noticed Sir John and Lady
Robertson, Sir Patrick Jennings, Hon. W. B
Dailey, the Maclean, Mrs. H. B Cohen.
Mrs. and the Misses Badham, Admiral Tryon and
several offners of the fleet, the Misses Barley, Mbs
A. Hogg, the Misses Throckmorton, Lady Man-
ning, Mrs. Gullet. Mrs. Fisher, Mrs. Andrew,
Major and Mrs. Ahvy, and many others. The day
was gloomy, so most of the ladies present covered
their finery with wrapa all more or leas gorgeous,
especially the former. Mrs. Gullett’s overall was
perhaps the most conspicuous, being a bright
royal blue plush edged with fox fur, and ner
bonnet a bright old gold colour. Lady Carington
showed exquisite taste in a dress of beautiful elec-
tric-blue ottoman silk, with a Roman scarf, which
was fastened on the right shoulder and crossed
over to the left side, where it hung gracefully to
the hem of the skirt; bonnet of nut-brown terry
ornate with a pale cream olush bow.
* * *
It is absolutely necessary to remark, for
the edification of a lot cf people, that dirty huts
and boots, greasy coats, and cotton gloves don’t
very well lit in with Government House, Sydney,
under the present gorgeous regime. Nor do ball-
dress costumes (worn in open daylight by ladles
who sport hideous feathers and often allow their
hair to hang down to their waists* conduoo to the
pleasure of other people of more decant tastes.
However, in a democratic community all due
allowances must be made for those who have to
agitate the handle of the beer-engine before
dinner, and to scintillate as duchesses at the vice-
regal court during the afternoon.
• • •
Another thing. Vice-regal refreshments,
we are requested to state, are designed merely to

On Saturday afternoon, 36th, the Sydney
Gaiety Theatre was crowded with a “ high-toned ’’
audience on the occasion of aa amateur dramatic
performance given in a d of toe Ly-ee-Moon Relief
Fund. That the acting of the ladles was appreci-
ated, was clearly shown by beautiful baskets and
bouquets of flowers which found their way on to
the stage from the audience. Lord and Lady Caring-
ton arrived with their suites punctually at half-
past 2. A box in the middle of the stalls was
prettily arranged and decorated with ferns and
flowers lor the use of the vioe-regai party.
Amongst the people assembled were noticed the
Bishop of Sydney and Mrs. Barry, Mr. and Mis.
Laldley, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Barton, Mr.
and Mrs. Carl Fischer, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hogg,
Mr. and Mrs. Le Patoure), Mrs. G. B. Simpson and
Miss Hogg, Mr. and Mrs. Gillies and Miss Ruck,
Mr. Wrench and the Misses Throckmorton, Mr.
and Mrs. Fred Cape, Mr. and Mrs. Kelly, Miss
Macaulay, &c. Some handsome dresses were dis-
played by the ladies, but the crush was too great
to allow of the finery being seen to advantage.
One dress must be mentioned—a bright blue vel-
vet robe, trimmed with heavy grey fur, and the
bonnet, a wonder in yellow velvet.

Lady Clarke, wife of the Victorian
baronet of that ilk, who attended the Queen’s last
drawing-room on the sth of May, wore a court
train of lovely white and silver brocade lined witn
antique satin; the petticoat of the same satin was
handsomely festooned with Honiton lace and held
back with trailing clusters of shaded flowers and
foliage: the corsage to correspond was finished
with a stomacher of diamonds. Lady Wilson, who
also attended, was attired in a petticoat of rose-
pink satin draped with the finest Venetian blonde,
showing the colour through; the train was of
white brocaded satin, having thereon bunches
of pink roses In the pompadour style: the train
had also panels of moss-green velvet lined with
pink satin. Mrs, Dauntesey, of Agacroft, wore a
very much admired dress on the same occasion;
It was a mass of soft whiteness just touched with
silver, like a snow-peak under the glances of a
noon-day sun; the most ethereally fine web-like
duchesse lace was very profusely draped over the
skirt. It found its source and end in snowy
masses ot ostrich feather; the train was white and
silver hioeade, and on it were groups of feather
plumes softly waving as their wearer walked; the
bodice was of satin trimmed with lace, and with
a snow-white feather plume over the left shoulder.

conspicuous. A lovely one was worn by a good
dancer, and was composed of white crepe de chine
beautifully draped with white lace ; clusters of
silver grass were placed about the skirt, and a
bunch was worn on the left shoulder. Another
fairr-like and lovely dress was white lace over
white satin, profusely trimmed with clear glass

gunner of H.M.S. Opal,and was frightfully injured

firing a royal salute on Coronation Day in Sydney

officers belonging to the fleet. The coffin was on

Kind hands had placad beautiful floral decorations
on the bier. The Dead March was played by the
band of the INelson, and this was the reason why
it was not present at the Gaiety Theatre as adver-

The Melbourne Age has forsaken the sub-
ject of Protection, and commenced analysing the
mysteries of the celestial regions —Things were
c.wkward for a lot of people who met Cardinal
Moran in St. Francis’ Presbytery yard on the oc-
casion of Archbishop Goold’s funeral obsequies.
They flopped down to receive the Cardinal’s
blessing and sank several inches into the mud—
Sydney DT. is surprised at Judge Innes’ ruling
that attorneys must not “ shear” the public by
charging, as Solicitor Coonan did, for work never
done and for counsel’s fees that have never been
paid. Tao paper says that both the public and the
lawyers willssk: “If these principles are to pre-
vail, how is the legal profession to be main-
tained?’ Isn’t this very like saying: ‘‘To be a
successful lawyer you must be an infernal rogue.”
....The N.Z. Houses of Parliament are sending a

buried in the local cemetery, fell into convulsions
and had to bo held down by several persoes....
There is a man in England “ who for 10 days at a

boot in the sand and pensively kicked it. Then he
noticed that it contained a foot. The rest of the
body was absent.... The Newcastle Daily News
mentions with some surprise that a whale was seen
within a mile of the coast. It was probably looking

seldom had more than one wife at a time,
usually of Europe in extraction, properly

Hinder, the bank manager, for the shooting of

manager of the Camel Carrying Co., of Adelaide,
reports that a number of men are making north-
wards from Queensland to the Mulligan Elver,
and across to the overland telegraph line, en route

DESPERATE DIXON.
There is a debating society in Bourke which
meets every week to settle the affairs of the
universe. In a late issue of one of the local papers
we saw that this Illustrious *' push” are going to
discuss “ Whether Home Rule for Ireland will be
a benefit to the Empire.” We also notice that
“ Messrs. Pry, Smith and Parsons are to affirm
that Home Rule will be a benefit to the Empire”
and that “Mr. Dixon has stated that he will oppose
anything and everything that Mr. Parsons may
affirm.” There's an Ajax for you 1 There’s a
valiant spouter I We are not at all interested in
what conclusion these back-blockers of Bourke
may come to with regard to Home Rule, but we
own to a consuming interest in Dixon. We are
taken by his fine recklessness of manner ; his
attitude of devil-may-care 'defiance ; but most of
all by his antipathy to Parsons. We would like to
know Dixon’s reason. We will woo him in
rhyme
Under the exciting heading of “ Run to
earth,” the Melbourne Herald tells In thrilling
language how, In the hallowed hush of the Sab-
bath gloaming, a desperate criminal entered
a house In Malvern and began to burgle.
Also how a young man happened to see him and
gave alarm to the police, and how “ a large num-
ber of residents immediately turned out to join in
the chase, one gentleman arming himself with a
loaded gun I” The reckless ruffian was followed
for a mile and a half, and then “ the party came
up with the escapee, who, being an old man, 80
years of sge, could not get along very fast, and he
was promptly arrested.” If it takes all the police
and half the rest of the population of Malvern to
capture an old man of 80, we reckon that two de-
termined Chinamen armed with clothes-props
could sack it any day they pleased. Side by side
with the paragraph concerning this wicked old
man there is one about a good old man who Is the
“ Oldest Living Victorian Colonist,” and has had
to support himself by making wire forks, until
lately when he became too feeble even to do that.
See the difference between these two men. One
struggles along eking out a miserable and meagre
livelihood by making wire forks, the other goes
gaily out at twilight and comes home with a
bundle of forks ready made-and silver ones at
that. One or two bits of luck in a month keep him
in fighting-cock food, generous liquor, and the
best of tobacco. The fact of his being such a rare
old sprinter is sufficient proof that he lived well.
Of course he gets into gaol periodically—but what
of that? The other old calonlst-the good old
man who helped the Hentysto lay the first founda-
tion of Victoria—has nothing better than the
Benevolent Asylum to look forward to. Now
what is the moral of these men’s lives ? If we did
not believe that there is another world where all
accounts are squared up and set straight we would
turn religious to-morrow and get all the wicked-
ness we could out of this one.
TO THE COLONIAL OFFICE.
That telegram gives us distress,
When we think of the dozens and scores
Of snobs who will perish, unless
As knights they return to our shores;
They have so looked forward to this,
The object it was of their trips—
And now shall the goblet of bliss
Be dashed from their quivering lips ?
What matters how many you knight ?
It makes, after all, little odds.
If they live in a dream of delight
And go to their graves little gods.
Oh I let ’em come swaggering back
With handles in front of their names—
Sir Johnny, Sir Tom, and Sir Jack,
Sir Peter, Sir Dick, and Sir James.
Nay, grumble no more at the list,
At none of these people demur;
’Twere rough upon Tom to be missed
If Dick got the coveted “ Sir
They’re all of ’em suitable men
(Aspiring apostles of plush),
So, tar the whole crowd of ’em, then,
Alike with a bountiful brush.)
Bear this little matter in mind;
’Tla we who should kick up a fuss—
They’ll soon leave old England behind
And dwell in their glory with us.
You’ll knight ’em and tell ’em to go,
Not long will your agony last—
But we're the poor beggars, you know,
That ought to be rather “ aghast.”
DESPERATE DIXON.
Come tell us, desperate Dixon, tell,
Why quite so mad
You are with Parsons—why you fell
Out with that lad ?
When you and he meet on the street,
Do you pass by
Without a word that youth to greet,
And if so—why ?
Say, la this feud of ancient date ?
Did, years ago,
The Dixons and the Parsons hate
Each other so P
And have they handed down from age
To age, the feud ?
And will you still the warfare wage ?
And what’s the good ?
Be wise and drown, lads, in three-star
Your foolish hate—
An. Iliad of Sandy Bar
Is out of date.
And, Dixon—do not think us rough—
Don’t be a Turk,
Without these feuds it’s bad enough
To live in Bourke.
Read this to Parsons—never fear
But it will curl
Him up. Now whisper la our ear—
Who was the girl ?
BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
The Sydney Corporation intends to frame
a set of rules as to the future allotment of the
players’space on Moore Park. Under the old
system, the cricket clubs themselves used to
absorb the ground fees, and in some instances
made a few shillings out of it. But we believe, by
the new rules, all the ground-fees will be handed
to the impoverished exchequer of the Council.

The very latest about Edward Hanlan,
Esq., is that he expresses his strong preference for
a single-handed race with Be aoh. “ All 1 want is a
fair chance, which I did not get on the Parra-
matta Itlver,” remarks the ingenious Edward, In
whom the truth evidently is not. Edward got all
the chance he wanted.

Pedestrianised has received another nasty
“jar” in England. The renowned Snook recently
accomplished such wonderful feats in the way of
in-and-out running, that a sub committee of the
Amateur Athutlc Association has struck his name
off the amateur rolls- It appears that the cham-
pion still has the right to appeal to the general
committee, so that the chances are that he will be
ultimately whitewashed.

Whoever is respot slble for the sending off
of Reuter's cricket telegrams would seem to have
been instructed to make things coulmr de rose for
“ Our Boys.” He tho opening match at Sheffield
Park it was telegraphed that the Englishmen won
the toss and naturally seat In their opponents to
bat on the dead wicket. This circumstance was
pleaded pretty considerably in excuse of the Aus-
tralian defeat. The facts of the case, according to
English letters to hand, are that “ Scott had the
good fortune to win the toss, and naturally elected
to take first innings.” Good wine needs no bush,
and the Australian team can afford to be Judged
on its merits, without any partisan misrepresenta-
tion.

Jem Smith, of England, and Sullivan, of
America, cannot come to terms as to the locale of
their proposed fight. Smith will only fight in Ire-
land, Sullivan in the States. However, Dempsey,
who has fought 38 battles and never been beaten,
means, though a much lighter man, to tackle
Smith.

Mr. Con. Dwyer has succeeded in breaking
English blcyle records for Hi Hi Hi and one mile.
Unfortunately, such tlme-cuitlng honours are
somewhat indefinite- Given identical conditions
of track, wind, weather, and watcfcholdlng. and in
that case the difference between 3mln 38 3 5360.
and 3mln. 39 3-53e0. would mean 10 or 11 yards in
the mile. But who on earth shall judge the rela-
tive values of two performances achieved indif-
ferent hemispheres, either of which performances
could be affected to the tuue of one second by a
multiplicity of causes ? Taken apart from old-
world records, Dwyer’s Melbourne exhibition was
in itself something worth looking at, but it is idle
to lay too much stress upon what the watch
showed. If we do, it could easily be made out that
Dwyer lacked stamina In comparison with the
English record-holder, Webber. The latter s time
for the last quarter of a mile is two seconds less
than that ot the Australian. But why waste time
in hair-splitting when there is the morning's fire-
wood yet unohopped ?

So far as we have been able to compile
from the scores of the Australian Eleven, finishing
with the Players’ match, the following are the bat-
ting averages, in their order of merit :
Sammy Jones 30 1-15 for 15 innings is certainly a
splendid performance.
At a recent volunteer dinner in one of the
small southern towns of N.S.W. a disturbance oc-
curred which resulted in the use of a weapon
that should only be uncovered in real battle. The
“ noisy ones” were summoned, but the cases were
not made public.
In Jersey City, U. 8., a man who offered
his seat in a tram-car to a lady was Immediately
shot dead by her husband. This is probably the
reason why so many ladies have to stand up and
cling on to somebody’s ear to steady themselves
when Sydney tram-cars are full.
Now what is the use of telling this story
to any but the marinas? “A gentleman got a
£5O cheque cashed in a Sydney bank As he left
the bank he found he had received £350. There
were three £lOO notes and 50 £1 notes He went
back to the counter and returned the £3001” We
claim all the italics.

A recent physiognomist has just discovered

that the circus-man would hardly warrant her

Applications for Shares to be addresssed to the temporary office of the Company, 33 Sydney Arcade.

Sydney BUSINESS OP THE COMPANY.
This Company is formed for the purpose of conducting a commercial loan business upon Mercantile
principles by making cash advances and Merchants, Traders, and private persons, upon
the security ot Bills of Lading, Storage and Bond Certificates, Deeds, Shares in Banks and public Com-
panies, Bills of Sale, Government and Municipal securities, &o.; also discounting Trade Bills and ad-
vances upon any adequate security. „ T _ , . ~ , _
The success attending this class of business by all loan Offices and Companies is well known, suffice
to say that investments in a Company of this kind are a certainty, and the Company can secure such
profits as will ensure good, if not large, dividends for its shareholders, without resorting to the spuri-
ous rates charged by private Loan Offices, and in so doing the Directors anticipate that the Company
will be amply compensated by largely increased business.
The Company's advances will only be made by the Directors upon ample and tangible securities of a
commercial character, after proper valuation by the Company’s valuers. They will not act as Pawn-
brokers as it is desirable that the Company should attain such tone as to make it a favourite medium
with commercial men. The advances will also be at short call, usually one to four months, or repay-
able by instalments. . ... . ... „ , .
The Company will also receive money on deposit at current market rates of interest.
By its incorporation, this Company will be enabled to transact business that the Banks cannot en-
tertain, being contrary to their Charters, although of a much safer and more profitable chaarcter, and
this Company will make no advances whatever without ample security and fair profits. In addition
to this they will also transact ordinary banking business for such Merchants or Traders who have only
limited or no banking accommodation. .. _ , ~ . , „ ,
It will thus be seen that there is ample scope for the Company’s operations, and, in fact, the
necessity of a respectable company for this class of business has long been recognised in commercial
circles*
It is'also desirable to point out that Shares in this Company are not a speculation but an investment
through which surplus funds can bo profitably employed to the best advantage with ample security,
so that large or small sums of money can be depended upon to return far larger percentages of profits
than any bank will pay for deposits. In addition to which the Company's stock will no doubt almost
immediately be at a premium, so that money invested in shares will not be locked up, but will be avail-
able whenever required. . ... ~
The Company can also advance money to its members when required upon Shares held by them.
Confidence and secrecy respecting clients’ business being a most important factor, only men of
proved integrity and ability will be employed, and all, together with the Directors, are pledged to
strictest secrecy respecting clients, so that, business transacted with this Company can be depended
upon not to jeopardise borrower’s credit or position.
It being desirable that the Company’s proprietary should include of all classes in the community, no
more than 2000 shares will be issued to any single person, the Calls are also made at such a rate as to
enable this result to be attained. , , .. , , , ,
A large number of shares having already been applied for, the balance are now offered to the public,
which will be allotted in the order applied for, until the share list is complete.
The General Meetings of the Company will be held half-yearly, when balance-sheets will be sub-
mitted and the dividends declared.
In placing the balance of shares of this Company on the market, the Directors submit with every
confidence that it is equal to any now before the public as a safe and profitable investment, suitable for
all classes in the community.
Intending Shareholders will please cut this out and forward to the Offices
of the Company, 33 Sydney Arcade.

MUSICAL YOUNG MAN MEDITATIVELY: "WHAT RUM-LOOKING ANIMALS THERE
WAS THOSE TIMES!”
Narrow Escape.
** * Rochester, June 1, 1883. “Ten Years
ago I was aitacaed wirh the moat Intense and
deathly pairs in my back and —Kidneys
“ Extending to the end of my toes and to
my brain !
“ Which made me delirious !
“From agony ! ! I I
“ It took three men to hold me on my bed
at times !
“ The Doctors tried in vain to relieve me,
but to no purpose.
Morphine and other opiates !
“Had no effect!
“ After two months I was given up to
die 1 !! !
“ When my wife
heard a neighbour tell what Hop Bitters had
done for her . she at once got and gave me
some. The first dose eased my brain and
seemed to go hunting through my system
for the pain.
The second dose eased me so much that I slept
two hours Something I had not done for two
months. Before I bad used five bottles, I was well
and at work as hard as any man couid, for over
three weeks; but I worked too hard for my
strength, and taken a hard cold, I was taken with
the most acute and painful rheumatism all through
my system that was ever known.
“ I called the doctors again, and after severs,
weeks they left me a cripple on crutches for life!
as they said. I met a friend and told him my case,
and he said Hop Bitters had cured him and would
cure me. I poohed at him, but he was so earnest
1 was Induced to use them again.
In less than four weeks I threw away my crutches
and went to work lightly and kept on using the
bitters for five weeks, until I became as well as
any man living, and have been so for six years
sicca.
It has also cured my wife, who had been
sick lor years; and has kept her and my
children well and healthy with from two to
three bottles a year. There is no need to be
sick at all if ti ese bitters are used.
J. J. BERK, Ex-Supervisor.

If when you call for American Hop Bitters (see
green twig of Hops on the white label and Dr. Soule’s
name blown in the bottle), the vendor hards cut
anything but American Hop Bitters refuse it and

Into and through the Kidneys flow the waste fluids of
the body, containing poisonous matter taken out of
the system. If the Kidneys do not act properly this

Headache, Weakness, Pain in the Small of back and
loins, flushes of heat, chills, with disordered stomach
and bowels. You can thoroughly protect the Kidneys

taste in the mouth, low spirits, general prostration,

disease more prevalent than dyspepsia, and none so

y^i\Vbi/sJ)EßilijYr
THERE are many men In this colony who are,
day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early Indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement Is addressed. Impotence drags Its victim
In Its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering his existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege—
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopeless Invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your case can
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this Invaluable Medicine, which will, in the
short space of Four Weeks, render you capable
of appreciating and Enioyluff Life.
This valuable remedy affords relief, and perma-
nently cures all who suffer from Wasting and
Withering of the Nervous and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cause incapacity and degeneracy, total and partial
prostration, and every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system—regenerating all the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil his most sacred obligations.

"PUTTING IT STRAIGHT.”
MR. CANDID: “WILL YOU BE SO FOOLISH AS TO LEND ME FIVE SHILLINGS?”


Political
Points
Last week’s issue of the N.B.'W. Hansard
contained 165 pages. Jawbone Nelld’s speech
covers only 29 of these.
It is ;just 13 months since that Bega editor
so grossly libelled Judge M'Parland, and yet there
h’B been no criminal prosecution. Truly Judge
M'Parland is a long-suffering and merciful man.
The members of the N.S.W. Legislative
Connell wanted to have a daily Hansard, so that
their speeches may be published. They may get
the speeches printed, but nothing short of penal
laws would make people read them.
So the Stamp Act has been mangled and
perhaps strangled by the N.S.W. Council. There
will be no liberal legislation in the colony till the
noary old Tory fossils who form the majority
there are prevented by dismissal from working
further mischief.
The Hon. A. Campbell, that fine old
crusted N.S.W. Conservative, sarcastically asks if
wealthy men should be taxed per capitum— by
the head. No, Mr. Campbell, certainly not. If
that were the case it wou'd be impossible to tax
the Legislative Council.
Edward J. H. Knapp, who likes to see
himself in print, advocates in the Sydney D.T.that
taxes should he put on “the five B’s, ’ which he
defines as “Burgundy, brandy, beer, ’bacca, and
bohea.” Edward, dear boy.it is not the “bees’
that should be taxed—it is the “ drones.”
The Brisbane Courier thus gently puis
great truth: “In obedience to the great law of th°
expansion of the white races, Anglo-Saxons hav
taken possession of this continent, j ist as they
did that of America.” And yet when any other
white race wants to expand besides ourselves,
what a row the Courier does make.
Sir Henry Parises has been well received
in Gloucester, the electorate of the magnificent R.
Hoddle D. White. A* Sir Henry is not by any
means certain of St. Leonards at next election,
and considering the uncertainty of Mr. White’s
return to the colony, the new-born interest of the
Opposition leader in the electorate is not without
some political significance.
“ The Native Press,” says a London paper,
“areinstituting comparisons between India and
Ireland. They express warm sympathy with Home
Rule, and watch with keen interest the struggle
now pending in Westminster. That is natural
enough, as like likes like all the world over.”
This is about the highest compliment we have yet
seen paid to these Asiatics.
The Age says “it is rumoured that in the
approaching elections Mr. Gladstone will oppose
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain at Birmingham.” We
won’t do “our own correspond ant” the Injustice
of imagining that he cabled such bosh. We can
guess the source of inspiration of that rumour.
David Syme got it from the office-boy, and the
office-boy got it from an active imagination, over-
heated by hardbake.
The North Queensland Separation petition,
bearing 10,066 signatures, was presented to the
Governor of Queensland last week—it and the de-
putation occupying a four-in-hand drag and sun-
dry cabs. His Excellency had his soft pedal down
and made a dreary joke about the casket contain-
ing the statutory copy of the petition. “ Casket,”
he said, ‘‘that’s the Yankee word for coffin. I
hope you are going to bury It. 1 should give it
another name.”
A London paper says that such language
as that of Premier Gillies (who declared that,
should the Imperial Government allow the New
Hebrides to he taken, “ Australia will assuredly
take them back when able”; has never before been
addressed, save possibly in a secret despatch, by
a colony to the Imperial Government; but, adds
our contemporary, there can be no doubt that it
represents public opinion in Australia!” If our
contemporary only knew I
Jawbone Neild, M.P., in the course of his
recent nine-hours’ blather in the N.BW. Assembly,
related an anecdote concerning an execution in
America, where a man ascended the scaffold and
harangued the erowd. Mr. Melville, M.L.A., who
is an undertaker, suggested that perhaps Mr.
Neild was the culprit. Mr. Neild replied that his
profession, at all events, did not take him to such
occurrences, as did that of the hon. member,
whereupon Mr. Melville claimed the protection of
i he Speaker.
There are some N.S.W. M’s.L A. who never
open their mouths in the House. L?t no one run
away with the idea that thei-e gentry can t talk.
They can talk, and talk the most infernal rubbish,
too. They get Into a tram-car, and shout at each
other over the seats about what they did in the
’Ouse, what they are going to dc, what a jaokass
to and so is, how they put him right, what they
object to in the Bill, &0., until the other pas-
sengers, with scowling brows, and fire in their
eyes, and cursing horr.bly in undertones, get out
a street or two from their usual stopping-place.
Professor Smith—his front name is Qnldwin
—thinks Mr. Gladstone is all wrong about the
Irish Question. “Let Parliament,” he says, “im-
pose silence on political revolution until the
economical question has been settled, and the
hungry begin to be fed; then the flame of poli-
tical disaffection will expire.” Tne Professor
evidently Knows all about it, a"d the great here-
ditary Intellect of the bmith family shines out in
these words. Expressions of opinion from other
eminent Smiths are Invited in relation to the
above subject.
London Spectator describes
as being “ irresponsible word-spinners, seldom
independent cf concealed capitalists, and never
independent of monetary favour of a news-seek-
ing class,” who “ are compelled by the conditions
of their trade to rcream out Immature judgments
formed without time for reflection or even inves-
tigation of the facts.” Having read the apotheosis
of Jawbone Neild in the second leader in last Fri-
day’s issue of the Sydney D T., we are incliued to
believe that the definition has a local appllc ition.

Advertisement from the Belfast (Ireland)
Newsletter of May 13:— “Rifles. Tenders re-
quired for 20,100 Sniders in good order, with
bayonets or swords, to be delivered, carriage paid,
on or before June 1, in lots, at certain statlonson

quired by purchaser. Address, Vigilance Com-
mittee, 8335, office of this paper. Wanted a few
men thoroughly competent to Instruct in military

we now learn by cabie that two of the northern
counties have been “proclaimed.”
There is something curious about the
heading, "Religious Riot in Belfast,” which is
g( log the rounds in the colonial papers. The dif-
Dculty was really between the patriots and the so-
called loyalists, but, as one party was mainly
Homan Catholic and the other Presbyterian, each
semi-religious journal likes to represent Its own
crowd as a body of Christian warriors wielding
sacred clubs and apostolic bed-posts in a noble
cause. But the same people would kick consider-
ably if they read about a “ Baptist murder in
Sydney,” a "Presbyterian burglary at Sand-
hurst,” or even a case of “ Episcopal wife-beat-
ing,” or a “ Brutal Primitive Methodist assault.”
The Victorian Government has made a
small concession to the principle of Land Na-
tionalisation. Last week Premier Gillies gave a
definite promise that no more of the valuable
lowlands on either side of the Yarra, near Mel-
bourne, shall be filched away from the people.
Many are the unholy j ibs that have been perpe-
trated in connection with these same lands The
ee-slmple has been relinquished In many cases,
and long leases have been granted on terms which
are best described as wicked. Just at the moment,
however, a little breeze of nationalisation senti-
ment is sweeping over Victoria, and the political
atmosphere is somewhat sweetened In conse-
quence.
It is rumoured that the relations between
the permanent head of the N.B.W. Lands Depart-
ment and at least one of the chairmen of the local
Land Boards have become strained to such an ex-
tent that a rupture is almost Inevitable. The prooei s
of decentralisation ia the administration of the
Department, which was one of the main objects of
the new Act, is not only opposed by the visinertiae
of the whole race of Tlte Barnacles of the Depart-
ment, as might have been expected, but ia also
hampered by the severe check Immediately and
ruthlessly placed by the powers that be, upon
any Independent action whatever initiated by the
Land Boards. The consequence of all this, In the
first place, Is galliag Irritation which is likely to
find Its ultimate vent in Parliament,
Sir Henry Parkes visited Croke, N.8.W.,

that It was the only place called at during the

A CAUTIOUS ACCEPTANCE.
the principal undertaker on behalf of the inhabi-
tants to the veteran politician “ who landed in
sixpence with Sydney in his pocket.” Far-seeing
Crokers I They dreaded the prospect of an
"address in reply.” And this reminds us. One
frosty morning in June, a "sultry” (you mean
close— Ed.) politician, well-known in rural circles,
arrived at Cabbage Top in the full glory of a coach
and four, borrowed you may be sure. He was pre-
sented shortly after with an address, which ran
something like this:—"John Jones, Excelsior
Boarding House. Beds, 61. Meals at all hours,
same price.”
This is the tone adopted by Vanity Fair,
the London high-Tory organ:—“So far as I can
see, the time has come to stop talking on this Irish
question. If the Ulster men are to be handed over
to Ford and Egan, if they are to be forced to fl fht
for their skins like rats in a pit, then any tble-
bodied Englishman is a coward if be stands by to
see the crime committed. When Garibaldi’s piracy
was carried out, our volunteers were applauded as
they left for Italy; surely the cause of the Ulster
men—of our own flesh and blood—is more to us
than the cause of Bicillans and Neapolitans. Eng-
land is still worth living in; but so sure as tee
Amerioan-Irlsh reprobates are allowed to plant
themselves In power on our very coasts, so sure
will England become a name of contempt. We
cannot, we must not, permit the crime.”
It will be interesting to note whether

If they don’t, it will he taken as an acknowledg-
ment that toe place was created for the man who
has just vacated it—which is true. It was the
opening through which he was enabled to main-
tain his claim on the N.B.W. money-bag. If they
appoint someone, then will the people cry out
with a loud voice “Jobbery! ” which also will be
true. Do any of our disinterested and partially-
fossilised statesmen long for a nook in West-
minster Abbey ? Now is their time. The billet is
an easy one and the climate deadly. And there
are many N.B.W. politicians whom we would
willingly send upon the single condition that they
never, under any pretext whatever, ventured to
return.
Mr. William Clarke, M.L.A., has dragged
the shirt of hypocritical seoresy off a new griev-
ance by drawing the attention of the N.BW.
Assembly to certain R.C. priests who forbid the
children of their congregations to learn history In
the public schools. The member for Orange is a
good fast colour, warranted to wash, and he does
not belong to the new order of men who regard
history as a luxury, which a child may study If so
inclined, after it has learned to read and write.
For our part, we have always been inclined to
regard this branch as rather a lifeless part of
education, and we do not care much for books
which tell how many martyrs were roasted on the
red-hot stoves of antiquity, and virtuous Kings
prodded with spears whlohlay so heavily on their
stomachs that they died before the early English
coroner could arrive. No doubt there is a moral
le son to be learned from the last words of some-
body who pissed away on the tented field with
virtuous sentiments In his mouth, and a cannon-ball
in his intestines, but this Is hardly education.
And we are credibly Informed that there are good
and great men in Australia who never heard of
Asshurbanlpal, and who do not know for certain
whether Ptolemy Physoou was a Choctaw chief or
a distinguished Turkish general. Moreover, his-
tory is increasing at such an alarming extent that
no one can keep pace with It. We are constantly
compelled to drop out past saints to make room
for present tinnei s, and perhaps it might simplify
matters a great deal to drop the whole lot so far
as our schools are concerned. We attended his-
torical lectures ourselves once, It Is true,
and we still remember their thrilling In-
terest ; the fall of an elephant could have been
heard distinctly in the remotest part of the room
as we hung on the speaker’s words, but, all the
same, life seems too short for history, and we don’t
want to hang there again.
Mr. Gillies’ famous New Hebrides despatch
Is still being discussed In England, and Is seem-
ingly creating a panic among that small-minded
class who “ don't want to fight,”and have resolved
not to shed blood for the purpose of prigging a
tiny archipelago that Is of no mortal value to
anybody. The last sentence of this historic docu-
ment is the chief cause of excitement, for it
shows that Duncan is organising himself and Is
already drawn up in battle array. It is as follows:
‘‘Should English Government give way or allow
to betaken New Hebrides to-day, Australia will
assuredly take them back when able.” Regarded
as ciblegraphlc poetry this is not bad. ‘‘Give
way ” and “ to-day ” make a very good rhyme, and
the rest of the stuff is chorus, while any rough-
ness in the metre may be exoused when we recol-
lect that tho verses have been transmitted some
13,000 miles beneath the sad sea waves, and the
gloss of fancy has been rubbed off and stuck to
the wires But regarded as a specimen of common
sense the athlete who backs himself to eat 1000
oork nies In 1000 hours is far ahead of Mr. G Hies.
Toe Victorian Premier probably forgets that the
world, ace irdingto Proctor, has| only 60.000,000 years
to last, and under these depressing circumstances
it is not advisable to make appointments so far
ahead. Moreover, other countries will be growing
up at the same time as Australia, and it is possible
by the time these colonies are prepared to “ take
back" the New Hebrides, Brown V.,lthe new Chris-
tian emperor of Cochin Chins, or Te Wheoro of
New Zm'and, just returned from sketching the
ruins of London, will also put in a claim and go in
for promoting ruoksbuns.
DR. T. W AR A KER, LL.D.,
CONVINCED.
The “Hull News” says:-The following is re-
markable proof of the wonderful powers of an
astonishing new remedy:—Henry Coates, of 11,
Cheatham-place, Adelaldc-street, in the borough
of Klngston-upon-Hull, railway who had
been a terrible sufferer for many years from
rheumatism in its worst forms, having read of it,
determined upon a trial, which has been attended
with the most extraordinary results; and being
anxious that his experience should be bnown to
other sufferers, he determined to bring it forward
in such a manner as to leave no possible doubt of
its reliability. So he appeared before Mr. E.
Singleton, a commissioner to administer oaths in
the Supreme Court of Judicature in England, and
made oaths as follows:-He tllirmed that he had
been totally unable to work for a long time, and
had teen confined to his bed for a considerable
period; that he had
TRIED VARIOUS DOCTORS
and many remedies, but that he grew worse Instead
of better; that at that time his joints were soswol-
len that he c ould not wear boots, and two crutches
were harily sufficient to support him. After hav-
ing heard of St Jacobs Oil In the manner before
stated, he purchased a bottle. In twelve hours he
found relief, and persevering in its use, he is now
cured of rheumatism, works daily, and can not
only walk with ease without a stick, but cm run:
he enthusiastically recommends this great remedy
to anyone suffering from any form of rheumatism t
as It has not only done wonders for him, but many
of his friends.” Referring to the foregoing,
Dr. T. WAR AKER, LLD.,
Intercollegiate Law Lecturer at Cambrld ?e
University, writes from his residence, 5 Scroops
Terrace, Cambridge : “ I have much pleasure
in stating that, having been convinced from
well authenticated oases within my personal
knowledge of the great success which has attended
the employment of Jacobs Oil in cases of rheu-
matism and neuralgia, I have recommended it to
several friends, and it has been used in my house
for these affections with very benefleal results.”
The “WHITEHALL REVIEW”
contains the following, relative to a discovery
of American origin, which is just now caus-
ing considerable stir throughout Great Britain:
—"The same has such a direct bearing
upon human happiness that It has been
made the subject of considerable comment
and investigation on the part of various news-
papers. As it is claimed that by the discovery in
question an absolute specific has been found
for the cure of certain most distressing ailments
with which the human family is afflicted, and
which have thus baffled medical skill, and as these
diseases, In their most aggravated forms, are very
prevalent, a representative of this journal was
commissioned to investigate the remedy by
personal Interview with the parties who could
speak from actual experience. From the results
as given below, It may well be claimed that the
general adoption of this remarkable remedial
agent will cause a revolution in the treatment of
these painful complaints.
" The first gentleman Interviewed was
Mr. WILLIAM HOWES,
the well-known civil engineer, No. 68, Rad
Lion-street, High Holburn, London, who, it
was learned, had made some personal ex-
periments with the preparation In question. Mr.
Howes stated that for over 20 years he had been
constantly and severely afflicted with rheumatism.
At times his hands had been swollen to twice their
natural size. Again, his joints became so sliff and
painful that he ould not walk, and his feet so
sore that be could not bear his weight on them.
He had at different times tried physicians, and
many remedies which had been recommended to
him as a cure for his complaints. But he derived
no benefit whatever. An acquaintance, who had
himself been cured of a severe rheumatic trouble,
gave him a bottle of this new discovery, which he
applied once, with such unexpected and marked
benefit that he procured another, which, to use
his own language, ‘settled the business,’ by
removing the pain which he had not been free
from for 30 years. Mr. Howes said that had he not
used Bt. Jacob’s 011-the remedy referred to—he
would now be in bed, instead of attending to his
busiaets. He added, ‘lts effects were simply
magical. It produced a complete cure. I will also
add that numerous friends and acquaintances,
suffering from rheumatic and neuralgic affections f
to whom I recommend the oil, speak of it as won-
derful. It seems to effect a cure in every case.’
“ The name of
Mr. C. H. PALMER,
Secretary of the Conservative Defence As-
sociation, and Overseer of the District of
Islington, having been mentioned to the por-
ter, this gentleman’s opinion was sought
and cheerfully givea in the following lan-
guage : ‘For a long time I have been a great
sufferer from neuralgia in my face and head, and
rheumatism in my limbs,’ remarked Mr. Palmer,
‘ After trying various remedies without obtaining
relief, and having learned of the signal benefit
which several friends who had been suffering from
severe rheumatism derived from the oil, I pro-
cured a bottle, the use of which completely re-
moved every trace of pain. I do not hesitate to
recommend it as a most valuable discovery.’
Having seen a card in an Australian paper from
the champion sculler,
EDWARD H AN LAN
(whose matchksi performances In Eogland and
America won him the title of “Wizard of the Oar”),
in which he strongly indorses this remedy as un-
equalled for athletes in training, and for speedily
curing pains, bruises, and other bodily pains,
several members of the London Athletic Cmo
were interviewed—among them Messrs. Wade and
Painter—and it was learned that tney also had re-
cently used the oil for such complaints, with
most happy results.
“It may be added that in its current number the
MAGAZINE of PHARMA OF, CHEMISTRY, and
MEDICINE
devotes corsiberable space to a discussion
on the extraordinary power of St. Jacob s Oil,
and cites some attonisaing carts
“It appears, also that this remedy received no
less than six gold medals during the past year
at International and other Expositions One or
these was awarded at Calcutta, another at the
great Southern Eihlbition in the United States^
