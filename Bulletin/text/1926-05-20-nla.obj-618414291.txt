Moscow through French Eyes
Since 1918 a procession of ideologists,
social reformers, doctrinaire Utopians, philo-
sophers and economists from Western
Europe have made pilgrimages to Russia.
Each has reported his experiences, discov-
eries and convictions to a listening world;
and in the divergences and contradictions
the cynics have found keen enjoyment. The
world outside Russia has gone on believing
precisely what it wished to believe in accord
with its own interests and prejudices “a
chacun so, verite.”
Professor Goode, Arthur Ransome and
Colonel Malone were facile apologists for
the Soviet regime, and their eulogies stimu-
lated the spread of Communism, of a dilet-
tante kind, amidst the idealists and malcon-
tents of the West. Wells, the omniscient
prophet of the Fabians, visited Russia in
the winter of 1920-21. lie returned to the
comforts of bourgeois England with the im-
pression that Lenin was “a little person with
bad eyefe, by no means a man of letters,
who was in the habit of writing short, un-
couth articles and pamphlets full of false
ideas about the psychology of the workmen
of the West, yet possessing boundless faith
in Russian Communism.” In 1921 Bertrand
Russell, hearing that the Bolsheviks had dis-
covered the secret of making earthly exist-
ence something like a fresco of Chavannes,
went to Muscovy to discover an Inferno in-
stead of a Paradise. On the desolate
steppes chance brought him by night upon
a strange encampment. Driven by famine
from some distant region, human beings lay
huddled upon the earth without protection ;
some were asleep, others squatted round
little fires of twigs, leaves and dung. By
the gleam of these thin flames Mr. Russell
caught sight of tire cadaverous, surly faces
of the refugees, all indescribably filthy, all
terribly emaciated, all inert and stupid. He
had a sudden vision of the inarticulate soul
of Russia, rendered spiritless and helpless-
by suffering and _ despair, neglected by the
band of Red politicians who composed the
party of progress and regeneration at Mos-
cow.
The disillusionment of the western philo-
sophers seems to proceed from the fact
that there is a deep gulf between the Euro-
pean mind, formed upon a definite articulate
and reasoned culture, and the Russian or
Kalmouk mind, which has nothing crystal-
lised or concrete. Russia is less a melting-
pot than a vessel containing a mass in fer-
mentation. The leaven which produces the
ferment is composed in great part of the
old Slav mentality of the steppes, a rebel
against all discipline, an enemy of all
authority, as inexplicably irrational as the
Celtic. Russia is an amalgam of contradic-
tions, of strength and of weakness, of ten-
acity and of brutal sensuality
and refined asceticism, of bestial cruelty and
sentimental kindness. All these opposites
find expression in her history and literature.
M. Henri Bemud, novelist and journalist,
sympathiser with Celtic Ireland against the
Government of Lloyd George, has written an
account of liis visit in 1925 to Russia. C'e
Que J’oi vu d J Joscou is a book of word-
pictures, devoid of pretentious statistics and
prophecy. It is addressed to the workers.
Being a socialist of the Left, he set out
upon his journey ready to receive a favor-
able impression of the Soviet regime, with
a belief in the future of Russia, and, in spite
of the excesses of certain propaganda in
France, incredulous of the communistic
peril. He must now be added to the list
of the disillusioned. The Red Revolution
may have bettered the condition of the
Russian _ workers who in 1914 were “the
proletariat of the proletariat,” but even
their present condition would be an un-
bearable political and material degradation
to the workers of western Europe. The eco-
nomic equality promised in October, 1917,
by Lenin lias failed. The workers have
nothing to gain from Bolshevism. “Listen !”
says Beraud. “Listen, Bolsheviks of the
clubs and the debating societies! Young
fools and old dilettanti! You think it is
merely a question of the scientific, bloodless
application of the doctrines of communism V
I‘oor fools! The chastity of your wives
and daughters, the pillage of your houses
and the handing-over of your children to
the Soviet State is what is at stake. This
is explicitly enunciated in hundreds of let-
ters I have received from Russian comrades
—and then, when our country is a mere
desert, ravaged by fire and stinking of hatred
and death, when we are at the limit of our
sufferings and endurance, there will remain,
as over there in Russia, nothing to be said
to you, the emaciated and panic-stricken
proletariat of France, but ‘Comrades, we
have made a mistake; we must beat a re-
treat ; let us reverse the engine.’ ”
In a chapter entitled “Metis oil done est
lc communisme?” Beraud gives a picture of
Moscow. I translate it without comment
, Behind the Grand Theatre at the angle of the
Ivouznetzy, in the busiest part of the city, I came
across a jeweller’s .shop, it was an establishment
tor the wealthy. Just a few jewels, and those of
perfect elegance, were displayed in the window.
1 here were rows of pearls, a few beautiful pendants,
a. choice of precious stones by no means plebeian,
and, in. the middle, a necklace such as no one but
a music-hall or cinema star could possiblv afford.
Alongside was the window of the Silversmith, where
a row of 20 hundred-candlepower electric lights
spread an illumination fit for the supper-room of a
grand duke.
Not far away I found the furrier’s shop. There
are no sables in the world finer than those which
in the Uojdestvenka lit up the eves of the little
ladies of Moscow. I entered and ‘ chaffered. Both
furrier and jeweller received ine in the traditional
style of the Rue de la Paix. They were obsequious
and obliging. It is true they were dressed like
workmen and eomplaisantly pointed to their shop
windows where revolutionary damage had been
’notched up by the Soviet artisan. There is only
one aristocracy here to-day; that of price The
sable was worth 90,000 francs. As for the necklace
it would take the combined salaries of all the stars
iff (he Folies Befgeres for a week to pay for it
As I left the shop, dazzled by the glare of ’the
lights, I found myself in the. dark street under the
rain. I groped along, elbowed by the crowd and
harassed by the shouts of cabmen. For a moment
1 leaned against the paling of a yard. Something
moved in the shadow. A beggar spoke to me. I
1 bought 1 knew what men in rags were like* I-
bad seen them in Whitechapel, in Naples and Smvrnn
excellent models. But; my eyes had never gazed upon
n Moscow beggar, just a rag and a mass of vermin.
T have seen many others like him since, but T am
pleased to remember that the first I saw appeared
suddenly out of the rain-swept shadows, ten paces
away from the shops I have described, in the very
heart of the proletariat capital, where one can cover
the shoulders of a mistress with pearls and furs
costing a million francs.
In Moscow, then, are poverty, dirt, swarms
of mendicants, not only in the slums of the
sacred city but at its very heart, near the
Kremlin itself, now a Temple to Economic
Equality, a few steps away from the rows
where dealers, private traders and jobbers
of all kinds are busy with commerce. The
beggars shout and jeer, implore, threaten
and defy the Soviet police, just as the ten
thousand petty traders snap their fingers at
them. Yet the letter of the law and the
theory of communism both deny the possi-
bility of the existence of private trading and
begging. This does not mean that the Rus-
sian Revolution is at an end: it means that
Soviet communism has failed, .and has given
place to a nationalist regime, and to a dis-
guised imperialism hostile to strangers which,
even now, is trying out its strength secretly!
Meantime the “Nepmen” have come into
legalised existence. They are the noiivcmix
riches, the new bourgeoisie of the N.E.P.
(the New Political Economy), and they have
prospered; but they are discreet enough to
conform to the outward shows of com-
munism.
FRANCIS JACKSON.
Portrait of a Pioneer
It is a self-portrait, and if it. fails to
square with the current generation’s concep-
tion of what a pioneer should be, I am afraid
. I cannot help it. The modern mythologist
believes that the first colonists were driven
from their country by a hatred of Old World
tyranny, a love of ronjantic adventure or a
desire to extend the hounds of good King
George’s fair dominions. Here is how my
great-grandmother described her motives for
coming to Australia -
In the first place, the lease of our house had
nearly expired. It was greatly out of repair, and
I knew that if we stayed to the end of' the lease we
should have heavy delapidations to pay for.
The South Australian Company had just
been floated to found a settlement on the
shores of Holdfast Bay, so my forebear pro-
ceeded to encourage her husband in his in-
clination to become a landholder in the new
province. “Accordingly he purchased 134
acres, each at 12s. per acre, which entitled
him to two in the principal town,” then still
in the womb of Time,
So the 99 souls who left London Docks,
June 28, 1836, on board the Africaine, in-
cluded my great-grandparents and three of
their children. Printing was my great-
grandfather’s trade, and before leaving Eng-
land lie had published the first issue of a
newspaper that was to be the bulwark of
the Constitution in the new colony, as well
as a thorn in the side of tyrannical officials.
He early showed his readiness to take up
public causes by heading a deputation to the
captain demanding better food. My great-
grandmother, on her part, occupied herself
and a good deal of her diary in strenuous
defence of a cat. The cat, which prowled
about at night in quest of the vermin swarm-
ing on the ship, was viewed with disfavor
by other passengers, and at length one of
them threw it overboard. The consterna-
tion of all was great. The captain took a
grave view of the crime, and so did the crew.
Disaster was prophesied, and. “strange as it
may seem, it is a fact that about four o'clock
this day, although the morning was fine, a
sudden squall came on, the most violent we
had yet experienced. The hatches were
closed, and for some time it' was a scene
of confusion both on deck and below, and
we could hear the captain and the mate giv-
ing their orders amidst the roaring of the
wind and the crashing of the rigging. The
sailors declared that they knew it would
be the and if they could catch the
scoundrel who had thrown the cat overboard
he should go after her.” Nemesis had
marked the miscreant for her own, however.
Shortly after the ship’s arrival in the colony
my great-granddad got an urgent calf to
the deathbed of a fellow-passenger. He
was “a gentleman both by birth and for-
tune,” but a dissolute young fellow; before
he died of drink he confessed to the murder
of the cat. “I hope,” concluded the diarist,
“his contrition was sincere, for that and all
his other offences, and that Heaven forgave
him, as I did most heartily.”
When this pioneer- was borne ashore at
Holdfast Bay on the shoulders of a seaman,
November 13, 1836, she was one year short
of 50. The temperature that day rose to
110 degrees, and that night the water froze.
The odd aboriginals who surveyed the land-
ing were “disgusting savages” who, never-
theless, inspired her pity and compassion,
and the only commendable feature about the
landscape was that it “resembled an English
park.” She had begun writing to her brother
in England, but there is no mention of the
Empire in her letters. Her concern was not
with such abstractions. “The water, alas,
far from being so good for washing as to
get clothes clean without soap, as some
accounts represented, was harder than even
the water in London,” she sadly observed.
Immigration agents, you see, were as un-
scrupulous then as they are to-day.
Nevertheless, it must not be supposed that
she sat down and bewailed her lot. Largely
owing to her practical efficiency the family
prospered amazingly. On the material side
there was every cause to bless those “heavy
delapidations” that had driven them abroad.
After a mouth in tents the fainify moved into
a rush hut, in which the thermometer some-
times stood at 120 degrees, and where the
second copy of the South Australian
Gazette and Colonial Register was
printed. There was an auction sale amongst
the bush on the Adelaide plains. Her hus-
band, the diarist wrote, “bought eight acre
lots at from six to ten guineas an acre, soon
after selling a quarter of one lot for 200
guineas and leasing another for 40 pounds
a year, and the tenant is to leave all build-
ings thereon at the expiration of the lease.”

FOR SYDNEY’S BEST HAT VALUES
Such were the consequences of the influx of

10 Slu°°was living presently in the stone cot-
tage in which she was to die at the ripe ag
of 88, never having seen again that England
of which she wrote in every letter home with
such passionate affection. The cottage was
much admired, her husband was makin tt
bricks, which were in great demand and was
printing a dictionary of the native language.
He “paid for wages in our office last week
£194, besides stationery.” this after the
colony had been established three years, She
threw herself with vigor into colonial affairs.
4. reptile contemporary had arisen to chal-
lenge her husband’s newspaper monopoly,
and she hated it robustly. "It is such a con-
temptible production and so full of blunders
that it will not bear comparison with ouis.
It indulged in despicable tactics, even way-
laying and destroying letters and papers in-
tended for its rival. Iler husband s publica-
tion became involved in a libel action, and
owing to its uncompromising attitude to-
wards a despotic Governor, lost Government
printing business. Her life was full enough
with these things, and with the endeavor to
salve for herself and her children the ele-
ments of Old World culture. She found
time occasionally, on the banks of the lor-
rens, to write verses “Oil beholding the
demolition of the ancient London Bridge,
and “On finding an English poppy in my
garden in South Australia.” But there was
nothing querulous in her comments. She
noted without alarm that her children were
reaching out to take possession of a heritage
which would never be hers. lor her part
she “would exchange it for a cowpen in Eng-
land” but did not repine. She would never
become an Australian, and she was clear-
sighted enough to see why. Nobody should
immigrate “at our time of life.” This 1S
certainly a very fine country. Doubtless
those who are born and brought up here will
think of it as we do of our native country,
that there is no other like it in the world ;
but to those who know what England is, it
never can bear comparison.”
One wonders how many similar tragedies
lie unnoticed in the archives of that period
we of a later generation call our “early days
but which were last days to so many. _ It is
pleasant to know that this sturdy pioneer
eventually became more reconciled. _ She was
induced to alter her “former opinion of the
climate and now to entertain a more favor-
able one.” Her favorite English poppies
had become acclimatised, and she sent some
dried leaves home as a curiosity; also some
seed of the castor-oil plant, “which grows
here very luxuriantly,” Then her last per-
sonal link with England broke : her brother
died. But in the meantime, in this new land
where all things “arrive at maturity much
sooner than in England,” a new link was
forged. She had become a grandmother.
M. G. S.
The Labor Party’s Genesis
Thought mid outlook grow middle-aged
rapidly, just as people and movements grow
middle-aged ; old-aged even more rapidly. In
the History of the N.B.W. Labor Party, the
old age of George Black, M.L.C., reviews,
with a side-glance at the disreputable middle-
age of the machine he helped to create, the
birth struggles of the Labor party in N._ S.
Wales. He has adopted the rather irrita-
ting method of issuing the story in monthly
parts which will run over a year and cost a
shilling each —a well-spent shilling to the man
who wants data about political history. The
first fragment deals merely with the causes
leading up to the formation of the party
and the preliminary steps. Those who have
read the same author’s “The Origin and
Growth of a Labor Movement” will imme-
diately detect the alteration of outlook which
has come with age. There seems a tendency
to apologise for revolt by emphasising the
causes that prompted it. But the knowledge
of the facts are there, and Black has set
them out concisely. Somewhat too concisely
in some regards. A wealth of anecdote and
personal story that would have given human
interest to the book has been left out.
The facts are of themselves interesting,
of course. The first seeds are traced to the
Chartist movement which shook Europe;
and the mention of the organisation of a
Reform League, before the revolt of the Bal-
larat miners was stamped out at the Eureka
Stockade, shows then (1854) the early de-
mand for manhood suffrage, no property
qualifications for Parliamentary candidates,
and payment of members which was to make
the path clear for the Labor party. In 1855
Peter Lalor, minus the arm he lost in the
Eureka rising, and John Busson Humffray
went to the Victorian Parliament as repre-
sentatives of the miners; but Charles Jar-
dine Don, elected in 1859, when lie was
working as a stonemason on the Melbourne
post office, is named as the first straight-
out Labor man elected in the sister State.
Lalor, who was later to be Speaker of the
House, met early trouble :
It is interesting to note now that Lalor was
censured by his constituents for voting in far or of
the Electoral Bill of 1856, whose fourth clause based
the franchise on a property qualification, and for his
advocacy of a nominee in preference to an elective
Upper House with a property qualification.
Humffray was censured, too —in IS62 —be-
cause he voted for a 10-years’ extension of
the squatters’ leasee.
In N. S. Wales', in 1859, James Hoskins
was elected for the Northern Goldfields, his
constituents supplying him with a salary.
He remained in Parliament until 1882, was
appointed to the Legislative Council in 1889,
and died in 1900. In 1859, too, Robert
Wisdom was elected for the Western Gold-
fields, and John Bowie Wilson for Goldfields
South. David Buchanan, a blacksmith in
Morpeth, was elected on the votes of the
selectors, who paid him a salary ; that was
in 1860. In that year also Daniel Charles
Dalgleish was elected by the West Sydney
voters —Black regards him as the first
straight-out Labor man in N. S. Wales. In
1874 Angus Cameron, a carpenter, was
elected for the same division and granted a
salary of £3 per week by the Trades and
Labor Council. There were other elector-
paid reps.: but Jacob Garrard, later a Min-
ister of the Crown, elected as first mem-
ber for Balmain, had, as a working engi-
neer, to put in his strenuous day’s work —
then 10 hours —before cleaning up to take his
place in Parliament. . , . ,
The movements and agitations wnicn
showed the growing desire for independence
and a developing national spirit are out-
lined ; under cover of these movements tiie
idea that culminated in the Labor paity
germinated. George Black, towards the time
that the agitations reached their head, was
a sub-editor of The Bulletin, the
strongest advocate for an Australian democ-
racy ; and he had practically a tree hand
in helping forward the movement.
The book teems with names; but it re-
mains a mere historical chronicle. A very
useful chronicle, undoubtedly; but what a
fine field there is for a story of the lives
of some of these men who were associated
with Labor's early struggles! Those men-
tioned as most prominent in the formation
of the first Republican Union in Sydney m
18S4 are Fred Flowers, J. D. Fitzgerald
(both later M’s.L.C.) and William Webster
(later a Commonwealth P.M.G.). There
was Tommy Walker, too, who made a tangle
of his ~ life in N.S.W., but had a political
resurrection in W.A.; and Louisa Lawson,
mother of Henry. O. L. Garland, bitterly
regarded as a Tory by Laborites of a genera-
tion ago, was president of the Land Nation-
alisation League, formed in 1887. '\. L.
Johnson (later Speaker in the House ot
Reps.) was a member, and so was Huie,
still secretary of the Single-tax League.
Prominent in the league also was John 1 ar-
rell, who sold his Lithgow Mercury to
another member, James Ryan, now M.L.C. ;
Hughes, Holman and Beeby (the present
Judge) were members of tlie Balmain
Branch. Con Lindsay was secretary of the
Australian Socialist League, formed in 188 1,
and one of the prominent leaders in the big
strike a few years later —poor Con lias
dropped out of affairs for years and fallen
on hard times. He was succeeded by E.
J. Brady, then unknown as a poet and
writer, but a clerk at Dalgety's, who lost
his job when the strike came for refusing
to work on the wharves. Brady was suc-
ceeded by S. A. Rosa, and ex-Senator W. G.
Higgs succeeded Rosa. Dr. Maloney was
the leading factor in Melbourne.
In a mere history it is impossible to
tell stories such as the one about W. M.
Hughes and his first election —how, without
a penny in his pocket, he had to walk m
from Balmain on the morning of the election,
work all day around the booths, and, towards
midnight, when his victory was proclaimed,
sail into tioo lots of steak and eggs, secured
on tick on the credit of his new Parliamen-
tary job. , , . ,
Yet the first number brings m at least one
item not essential to the plain history. The
caretaker at Leigh House, which was a
favorite meeting-place, of the insurgent so-
cieties, “was an ill-looking fellow named
Butler.” He was subsequently the brutal
murderer of Lee Weller at Glenbrook. But-
ler wanted to ask Black to testify at the trial
as to his good character, but his lawyer,
Harry Levien, dissuaded him.
HAROLD MERGER.
Second Chambers
lii 1917-18 a conference to consider the
question of the reform of the House of Lords
was held under the chairmanship of the late
Lord Bryce, than whom a more learned con-
stitutional authority could not have been
chosen. Though the deliberations of this
body, composed of 30 members drawn m
equal numbers from the Lords and the Com-
mons, came to no practical end —so great
were the differences of opinion—agreement
was arrived at as to the chief functions of
a Second Chamber for that country. Whilst
necessarily confined to the immediate subject
matter of the conference, the conclusions put
in compact form certain basic principles
applicable to all Second Chambers under
British rule, despite the fact that such
Chambers may vary one from the other m
constitution and powers.
In The Functions of an English second
Chainin', by G. B. Roberts (Allen and
Unwin), the author explores the question,
taking the enunciation of first principles set
out in the Bryce report as the foundation of
the argument. The functions of a Second
Chamber as thus declared are: (1) The
examination and revision of bills brought
from the Lower House —to use a popular re-
ference; (2) the initiation of bills dealing
with subjects of a practically non-eontro-
versial character which may have an easier
passage through the Lower House if fully
discussed and put into a well-considered
shape before being submitted to it; (3) the
interposition of so much delay (and no
more) in the passing of a bill into law as
may be needed to enable the opinion of the
people to be adequately expressed on it;
and (4) the full and free discussion of large
and important questions at moments when
the Lower House may happen to be so much
occupied that it cannot find sufficient time
for them.
On the first, and in oversea Legislatures
the most important, function —the examina-
tion and revision of bills—Mr. Roberts
remarks on the great usefulness of the
Second Chamber in its critical attitude to
the text of the measures as well as their
contents. The duty is cast on its members
of rectifying mistakes in the drafting and oi
re-modelling parts or phrases to ensure that
the intention is expressed by the words used.
They look not only to principles but to
form, for it is undoubted that a bill very
frequently leaves the popular Chamber in
a very defective condition for its purpose.
The Second Chamber exercises a still more
important duty in making such amendments
as it deems necessary, without destroying the
principle of the bill, to uphold the rights of
minorities disturbed by it. It takes a wider
survey of the welfare and rights of the
people as a whole than may be reasonably
expected from a popular Chamber with a
majority pledged to a particular political
policy.
With regard to the next function of a
Second Chamber, the initiation of non-
controversial bills, in the Lower House such
measures, lacking a party interest, are dealt
with more or less apathetically and with a
degree of indifference, whereas the Second
Chamber usefully performs the duty of look-
ing carefully, in a calmer and more delibera-
tive atmosphere, into such measures and
putting them into well-considered' shape
ready for. it may he, merely the formal
assent of the busier branch of the Legist a-
ture beset by political contest and excite-
ment.
On the third function, the interposition of
reasonable delay in the case of a bill to
allow for the expression of public opinion
where seemingly hastily-passed and ill-
considered legislation is proposed, the idea
of public protection arose from the attitude
of the Second Chamber in the early years of
the nineteenth century. “The power of the
House of Lords,” said Mr. Balfour, “is not
to prevent the people of this country having
the laws thcv want, but to see that the
laws they have are really endorsed by the
commonsense of the community at large.”
This function is primarily intended to secure
protection for the community in the shape of
desired legislation to the exclusion of un-
desired legislation. Time is secured for
mature consideration, and in the mother of
Parliaments that is now obtained, since the
passing of the Parliament Act of 3911, by a
system of retardation, but in the issue the
will of the Commons must eventually pre-
vail. The effect of taking from the Lords
their power of absolute veto is viewed by Mr.
Roberts with some dubiety, though, as he
points out, an extremist Government, bent on
making an unscrupulous use of its power,
“could with greater ease and rapidity carry
out its purpose by a series of administrative
acts than by legislation,” and no Second
Chamber in our Empire has power to directly
control the policy of the Executive.
The fourth function is one which has a
more special application to the House of
Lords than to any Australian Second
Chamber. In the heart of the Empire' ques-
tions of-foreign policy arise which may more
capably be discussed in the Chamber into
which a body of men possessing special
knowledge has been incorporated. Now that
the children of the Empire are being increas-
ingly drawn towards the central ruling
power by active co-operation with it in mat-
ters of national interest, such questions will
more frequently arise and the importance of
this function be accentuated.
The author devotes a chapter to the Aus-
tralian and Canadian Senates, and remarks
that Australia has “provided the world with
one of its most interesting Second Cham-
bers.” But who wears the boot knows best
where it pinches; and there are stabs of pain
now and then. In particular, where the con-
stituency is so great that the candidate can-
not be known to it, too great power is handed
over to the party machine. This has some
curious consequences. Some years ago a
N. S. Wales Senator was reproached for his
apathy. “Why should I work?” lie asked
in reply. “If my party is in favor next
election I shall get back; if it isn’t I shan’t.
What I do or don’t do won’t matter in the
least.” He overstated the case; but the
truth lies in that direction.

A Satchel of Books
The Vandal, by A. E. S. Riddle (Erslune Mac-
donald). The author, an army officer in the Great
War, sets himself a hard task. His object is to show
that ’ war is incompatible with Christianity, and he
proceeds to do so in blank verse which has in it
a certaiil incongruity and suggestion of humor. The
effort, Miltonic in form, contains long and argu-
mentative passages between the Almighty and Satan;
interspersed by refrains and choruses with a jingle
in them. The writer would probably have succeeded
better in his high purpose if he had stuck to the
less ambitious medium of prose.
Mad Marriage, by George Gibbs (Appleton). The
hero is a man strained between the tie of honor and
the tug of affection. In the end he risks his own
life to save that of the wife of his mad marriage.
Through her death he is set free and finds happiness
in union with the woman who has loved and waited.
A homely, commonplace plot told with skill.
Beasts and Super-beasts; Reginald and Reginald
in Russia, by H. H. Munro (John Lane). Two volumes
of short stories by the late “Saki.” If not as com-
plete a master of the “surprise” as O. Henry was,
“Saki” nearly approached him in such skilfully
constructed bits of work as “The Reticence of Lady
Anne,” and his death left a blank in the thin front
rank of writers of the short story in Britain.
Auction Bridge Informatory Doubles, by A E.
Manning Foster and George F. Hervey (Geoffrey
Bles). It is comparatively recently that the Ameri-
can informatory double lias found its way into the
Portland Club, though it may now be said to be
part of the recognised English form of play the
American system has introduced new perplexities
into an already complex game. Our cousins claim
that plavers who use the doubles have at least a
10 per cent, advantage over players who do not,
but the new weapons are dangerous and apt to recoil.
This little book adds to the literature of the game
and will assist in resolving the doubts and difficulties
of disciples.
Letters of Sir Walter Raleigh, edited by Lady
Raleigh (Methuen). The Walter Raleigh of this
collection—selected from 2000 letters—has little in
common with the romantic adventurer of Elizabethan
davs The onlv son of a Congregational minister
with a Scottish Covenanting ancestry, he was educated
at University College, London, there took his degree
in Arts and then went on to Cambridge. After some
years in India he returned to England, was appointed
to the Chair of English Literature in University
College Liverpool, and entered on the literary woik
with which his name is associated. From Liverpool
he passed to Glasgow as Professor of English Liteia-
ture ■ there,as elsewhere he held that Ins true func-
tion’was not so much to discuss theories or trace
influences as to exhibit what vyas great in English
letters. He was later invited to Oxford to be the
first holder of its Professorship of English Literature.
In July, 1918, he was appointed official historian of
the Air Force, and seven years later made a visit to
Bagdad and Mosul, from which he returned to end a
notable life as teacher, critic and histonan. A
tolerant and large-hearted man.
♦
“C.M.” : The Galleries of Melbourne and his home-
town,' Adelaide, have very few examples of Heysen’s
work, and none that can be called first-rate. Sydney,
however, has a fine collection. It is regrettable the
trustees don’t show as much wisdom in securing good
things by Norman Lindsay when they are occasionally
offered. But for the big Dionysius drawing, the
Sydney Gallery hasn’t anything worth a second look.
Lately the trustees turned down a fine drawing
which Lindsay did for Gellert’s poem “The Blind
Man.” “Would not buy your N.L. drawing at any
price,” the seller says they informed him. A mis-
taken polie.v, when we consider the rarity of the
wonderful little man’s pen-and-ink work to be had
at a reasonable figure.
Four years ago the Melbourne University Press
was founded. Among its quaint side-lines is the
letting out. of academic hoods and mortar-boards;
but it may be that in futurity’s eyes its chief claim
to fame will be its publication department, which
aims at printing the original work of graduates and
pedants' of the institution. Its record last year was
20 books and periodicals and its sales amounted to
£2476. A small beginning, but it was out of small
beginnings that the world-famous Oxford and Cam-
bridge University presses grew. Professors Berry
and Gunn are its moving spirits.

Studebaker
Advantages
One-Profit Manufacture Only
Studebaker in the fine car field makes
all vital parts in its own factories—
all bodies, engines, steering gears,
clutches, gear boxes, differentials,
springs, axles, brakes, grey iron cast-
ings and drop forgings. Studebaker
thus eliminates extra profits which
all other manufacturers (except
Ford) pay to outside body and parts-
makers. These savings enable Stude-
baker to use finer materials and work-
manship without charging high
prices.
Unit-Built Construction —By making
all vital parts under one supervision,
each is made to harmonize perfectly
with every other part. This results
in a perfectly coordinated car which
functions as a unit, insuring longer
life, greater economy, finer perform-
ance and minimum repair bills.
Always up-to-date —B eca u s e all
phases of manufacture are under
Studebaker’s control, Studebaker cars
are constantly kept up-to-date. Im-
provements are continually added,
instead of being saved up for an-
nouncements of “New Yearly Mod-
els”. Thus resale values are sta-
bilized.
Instant Comfort
In Case of Storm
The Studebaker Standard Six Duplex-Phaeton
(illustrated above) offers the exclusive Studebaker}
Duplex body. Only the Duplex provides the pro-
tection and comfort of an enclosed car, coupled with
the delightful freedom of an open car —both in one!
In thirty seconds, and without leaving his seat, the
driver can enclose the entire car by simply lowering
the weather-tight roller enclosures. The inconven-
ient method of storing dusty side curtains under}
seats has branded other open cars as obsolete.
The steel-framed upper structure is a permanent
part of the body. In addition to double comfort, it
offers increased safety. The Duplex superstructure
is so strong that it will support the entire weight of
the car in an upside down position
Before you buy any car, see this new-type open-
closed car on the dependable Studebaker chassis,

Change to Fair.
The bride-rain veiled an autumn sweet,
With robin song and apples red.
The feast was laid; for it was meet
The widowed year again should wed.
Tall Summer had been three weeks dead
The brown grass withered at her feet.
A piper blowing soundless song
Lay, bosom white, the earth along.
Expectant voices on the hill
Murmured together fine, small things;
The streamlet had a bowl to spill,
The trees were whispering with wings.
The morning was as one that sings
A secret song when hearts are still
And memory walks tall and fair _
Down gracious ways Of scented air.
I sa,id:.“The quiet day will hold
All sweetness lost beneath the sun,
Under the cool green drops, the gold
Of some great happiness is spun
In finer threads that lilting run
By loops and bobbins dear and old. - '
You said : “The soft rain falls like rest;
I think I love the Autumn best.”
The bride-rain, thin as happy mist,
Fell all about the quiet land.
We saw far drifts of amethyst,
Where silver arches lightly spamied
The murmurous hills on every hand.
You laid your fingers on my wrist
And spoke no word. A window blue
Was opened and the world was new.

Whence comes each bounteous argosy—

Good sweat, good living and good grain!
Some think her that, some think her this,
Would win her with a wanton kiss—
A bauble bright, a glint of gold—
But she’s not to be bought, or sold.
She, with her husband, lives discreet;

Sing of the sun that is God’s hand
Outstretched to those who sigh!
Sing a song of the blue day
A laughing through the trees ;
And sing of all that is Love’s way
Between the hills and breeze!
Sing, oh sing, my waking heart,
Sing that we live to-day!
Sing, or ever a tear start
For tears long passed away!
VICTORIA.

The Women’s Man.
All women love a sailorman,
Whate’er his color be,
From Esquimalt to Martaban
Or round the Tasman Sea;
For women love naught better than
To capture what is free.
The Kroo girls off in Senegal
Look for their steamer men ;
The Malay deckhands hear the call
Of women-lure and then,
Like wild birds of the ocean, all
Sail out to sea again.
Though landsmen may be best to wed
And truest in the end,
What maid’s forgotten what he said,
That smiling sailor friend
Who makes world-pathways blue to tread
And rolling distance -rends V
The huntsman triumphs in the chase,
The warrior in the fight,
The sailor has no resting-place
Beneath night’s starry light;
And woman gives him gifts of grace
As though they were his right.
They love so well, these women who
Have sent their hearts to sea.
They know the old law, always new,
That conquering tribes must be
Of hard, staunch men and women true
With children at their knee.
The cities lull in lazy dream
The peoples of the lands,
Soft luxury and living seem
Their women’s last demands ;
Yet when from eyes the blue seas gleam
How soon each understands!
The hunter triumphs in the chase,
The Soldier with the sword ;
For sailormen no victor's place
The rolling deeps afford.
But women grant them gifts of grace,
Their crown and their reward.

THE FARMER AND A DEPUTATION.
A party of mourners waylaid Customs Min-
ister Pratten the other day in Sydney with
the familiar request that the duties should
be taken off agricultural tools and machinery,
their intense desire, as Freetraders, being
to have their apparatus made under high
Protection in the United States and Canada.
This anomaly is partly due to the fact that
wily importers, who want to destroy local
industry and make big profits by bringing in
foreign wares, have impressed it on the
bucolic petitioners that they are a wronged
and robbed congregation. That tale gener-
ally finds a hearing—to some extent because
in the unenlightened days when the deputa-
tionists were at school N. S. Wales still
wallowed a good deal in the COBDEN super-
stition, and it was the fashion to teach that
Freetrade. was the source of England’s great-
ness, and should be eternally preserved in
consequence. Many things have hap-
pened since then to throw scorn at
the superstition; some are happening even
now. The mourners told Pratten that
agriculture in N. S. Wales is dying
of hardship, neglect and exposure to the
weather, the number of people employed by
it in the State having dropped from 58,009
to 46,000 inside 10 years. They appeared to
regard this decline as proof that the busi-
ness should be favored at the expense of the
agricultural-implement-making trade which
shows no tendency to decline. “The world
wants our primary products,” said the most
melancholy farm-man, “but it does not want
our hats, boots or pianos.” He was absurdly
wrong. A small and distant bit of the
world, principally Britain, takes “primary”
products from this country; but competition
is keen, and if Australian bacon, beef, but-
ter, cheese, mutton and even wheat failed
to turn up there the fact would make no
overwhelming difference. On the other hand,
a very large bit of the world —our own bit —•
wants our “hats, boots and pianos,” and
would be in great trouble if the supply was
suddenly cut off.
* * * *
It is a fact, as alleged, that the agricul-
tural population of N. S. Wales is a greatly
diminished band. There were more people
cultivating the land 30 years ago than there
are now. But they cultivated very much
less land. Federation hadn’t arrived 30
years ago, and the Ma State talked Free-
trade bunkum with a light heart and a thick
head. It was barely learning to make agri-
cultural machinery then. A return issued
a few years before the Commonwealth be-
gan showed that the machine industry
in N. S. Wales employed only 30 hands.
At latest advices it supplied work and wages
for 610, notwithstanding that the State still
has much leeway to make up; Victoria and
S. Australia with fewer people have 4581
workers similarly engaged. Largely because
of the cost and character of the imported im-
plements, N. S. Wales agriculture was for-
merly confined to a small, rich area, and it
was done to a ridiculous extent by hand
labor. Figures for one of the closing years
of the Foreign-trade period and two subse-
quent years under Protection show up thus:

1923-24.. 46,823 4,811,891 102 8,799,353 182
The increased use of machinery, which
became cheaper and better as the tariff
stimulated local production, revolutionised
agriculture. N. S. Wales, which even in
the late Freetrade days failed to provide its
own loaf, became a great exporter of wheat
and a producer of flour for export. That
ivas because one man, aided by a little extra
plant, could do in comparative comfort what
had been the arduous work of nearly four
men. It was the inventor and manufacturer
who brought about the change. The move-
ment is still in progress, but the surviving
fossils on the land want to stop it, and to
suppress the industry which gave them such
an uplift. The Bulletin refuses to believe
that they speak for anything like a majority
even of N. S. Wales wheat-eoekies.
* * *
There is no reason to believe that even the
fossil on the land is always the tattered crea-
ture he is instructed to think he is when on
Freetrade deputation bent. The crowd
which waited on the Minister for Customs
represented “stockowners, graziers, sheep-
breeders, and farmers and settlers’ associa-
tions,” and these folk don't all sleep in the
Domain. It said that its position was so
low that it couldn’t even get a fence erected,
so many people having fled to the city. The
obvious explanation is that the farm can't
employ all the farmers’ sons now that the
age of machinery has arrived. If the super-
fluous son could become a factory-worker in
an adjacent town he would probably go
there, and then his knowledge of how to put
up a fence would still be available in slack
seasons, or when he felt like having a
change. Unfortunately it is the policy of
persons of hoggish intelligence to drive all
factory-workers to Sydney, with a few left
over for Newcastle, and the lay-out of the
railway system has been carefully adjusted
to that end ; also the railway rates. When
the farmer’s son has started either manual
or clerical toil in the city he seldom goes
back to do fencing at Barringun. Some
people, of super-hoggish intelligence and
addicted to Freetrade deputations, want to
drive the State’s factory-workers still far-
ther away—to England, the United States
and Canada —and send their surplus food
all the way after them, and bring their agri-
cultural machinery all the way back. How
that is going to improve their local labor
supply they don't mention. The local
market, which consists to no small de-
gree of the manufactm-ing class and its
dependants, bought during the eight years
1917-24 no less than 841 per cent, of the
products of forestry and fishing, 794 per
cent, of the dairy and farmyard output, 654
per cent, of all crops, and even 34f per cent,
of what the haughty squatter had to sell.
The factory-hand would buy even more than
he does if the secondary and disappointing
individual on the land would take the trouble
to grow enough oats, hops, rice, cotton,
coffee, etc., to supply the market. It is
amazing to view the contempt, like that of
Odin on meeting a cockroach in Asgard,
of a bucolic Freetrade deputation for the
local artisan customer as compared with any
distant outsider, and for his local interests
and wishes. The men who called on Pratten
even wailed that the N.S.W. wheatgrower
should get “the same measure of Protection
as the maker of boots.” In reality he gets
very solid Protection, which prevents him
being annoyed in the markets of, say,
Queensland by the arrival of grain per cheap
ships from Canada. And his subsidy on the
N.S.W. railways in 1924-25, by the con-
veyance of his produce below cost, was some-
thing like £1,400.000.
* * * *
But there is another point. The supreme
curse of latter-day finance is that Australia’s
exports have become wholly insufficient to
pay interest on its outside debts (which must
be liquidated in gold or in something that
will sell for gold, local paper being valueless)
and to pay for the absurdly large mass of
imports. Hence the batch of new loans
which are annually floated in London or
New York, and which are hurrying this com-
munity's ssorted hairs towards a bankrupt’s
tomb. Men who demand special facilities for
importing still more goods should only get a
hearing if they begin by promising to pay the
suppliers of the goods in gold—their own
gold, shipped by themselves —so as not to
aggravate a case which is aggravated already.
THE COUNTRY MANUFACTURER.
The blessed word decentralisation* so often
heard from press and platform in the coun-
try districts, and figuring so prominently
in the platform of every political party, re-
presents, after all, a “cause that lacks assist-
ance” and makes no real progress. It never
will make progress either until the condi-
tions that foster and compel centralisation
are altered. At present there is no effective
weight, in persons or money, behind the de-
centralising movement. To get that weight
it is necessary to get population—-to get it
into the country districts, away from the
coastal towns. With a bigger population
in the country the political balance would
be shifted, and the conditions making for
centralisation would be modified. That, of
course, is akin to saying that if the disease
did not exist it could be cured. But, fortu-
nately, the outlook is not quite so hopeless
as that.
* * * *
The principal obstacle in the way of de-
centralisation is not the conscious desire of
the cities to bloat, but the imperfect adjust-
ment of the machinery of the States to the
purposes of Federation. When in 1901 the
principle of Protection for manufacturing
industries was adopted and the dumping
practices of the foreign manufacturer were
countered, the necessity for revising railway
tariffs so as to ensure national development
under the uew dispensation was overlooked.
In N. S. Wales, for example, the spirit of
the old pre-Federation “rate-book” —the main
principle of which was to take all primary
products to the seaboard at the cheapest pos-
sible rate, and to make profits on the car-
riage of imported goods—was retained. The
original intention was good, but in the
changed conditions the results are wholly
bad. The effect is to give city factories pro-
tection against overseas factories, but _to
penalise very severely the country factories.
The point can be made clear most readily
by a few concrete examples. A ton of hides
makes approximately 890 pairs of boots. If
they are made by a Sydney manufacturer,
all he pays is the freight on a ton of hides—-
80s. lOd. if the goods are derived from Goul-
burn. But a Goulburn -manufacturer has
to obtain certain materials —oils and greases,
acids, cardboard-boxes and sundries, on which
the freight from Sydney would be 365. Id.
Then to freight his 890 pairs of boots to
Sydney would cost £7 2s. 5d., of which 535.
6(L would be paid for carrying the
cases. The railway penalty on the Goul-
burn manufacturer —who must find a market
in the thickest centre of population—there-
fore amounts to £7 7s. Bd. on the product
of a ton of hides. An even more striking
case is to be found in the soap-manufacturing
industry. If six tons of soap are made in
Sydney all that the manufacturer must pay
railway freight on is three tons of tallow,
on which the charge is £6 12s. But a manu-
facturer at Goulburn must, pay freights as
follows: Resin, 525. Bd.; caustic-soda, 41s.
6d.; salt, 4s. lOd.; paper wrappers, 3s. Bd.;
total, £5 2s. Bd. Then to get his six tons
of soap to Sydney lie must pay freight on
the soap. £24 125., and 245. for packing, a
total railway charge of £3O 18s. Bd., which
means that the Sydney manufacturer has an
advantage over the Goulburn manufacturer
to the extent of £4 Is. Id. per ton. Or take the
case of wool. Railed, greasy, from Goulburn
to Sydney, the freight is 58s. 9d. per ton. But
if the wool is scoured at Goulburn the freight
jumps to 645. Bd. per ton, and if the wool
is not only scoured but woven into tweed
at Goulburn the charge for taking it to
Sydney becomes £4 18s. lid. per ton.
* * * #
Were this railway tariff corrected there
would no doubt be a recrudescence of coun-
try manufacturing; in addition the Railway
Commissioners themselves would benefit.
The trouble is that each conference on
the subject lias only been considering
the minor details the minor troubles
that each has had. The broader policy
of reconciliation of our railway freight with
the Customs tariff and national policy has
never been considered, or, if it has, those
giving it consideration have leaned to the city
manufacturer. The only solution is a big rebate
on freights from the country into the city
equal on manufactured lines to the rate of
the same weight of the raw product from
which they are manufactured. Many coun-
try factories have given up, some struggling
to the last, some with far-seeing executives
quickly resigning to the inevitable. The few
remaining turn out products whose freights
represent a big percentage of their selling
cost, and they must close down unless pro-
tected by a drastic railway tariff just as
protective for them against the city as the
Customs tariff is for the city manufacturer
against the overseas. The problem is a
bigger one than the minor matter of the
salvation of these factories—it is that the
Government and the Railway Commissioners
and the powers that be will have to face
the situation seriously unless the future de-
velopment of Australia is to be the hollow
sham of a crowded porch and an empty back
yard.
THE RED BEAR ON THE WALLABY.
The other day Bolshevism consolidated its
advance into the Pacific. The event attracted
no attention whatever in the. newspapers.
The victory comprised the conquest of the
island of Hainan. Hainan on its part is
barely noticed in the geographies. Even the
“China Year Book” is satisfied with the
mere mention of its name. Yet Hainan, if
it were anchored off the Australian coast
and had as many white people as it has
yellow, would be a valuable adjunct to this
country. It has about half the area of Tas-
mania, and is almost entirely mountain.
There is so much peak and so little base that
the mountains arc cut off short in sheer
cliffs before they reach the sen. Neverthe-
less, this unprepossessing fragment harbors
more people than the whole of N. S. Wales.
Its chief export is domestic servants, and
wonderful domestic servants they are. Nearly
all the "boys” who minister to the white
community of Singapore, the Malay States
and the Dutch East Indies are indigenes of
Hainan ; go are the stewards on the Burns-
Philp steamers. The other products of tile
island are pigs, eggs and bullocks, and. of
course, “untold mineral wealth” lies hidden
in its soil, effectually guarded by the spirit
of feng-shui.
Hainan, I fancy, has never earned the
distinction of being bombarded, for altruis-
tic reasons, by a European Power; and
though its Government has shared the vicis-
situdes of politics on the mainland, it has
been providentially able to turn republican,
democratic and monarchist from time to time
without having to change its rulers. At the
end of last year, however, its good fortune
left it. It happens to be separated from the
province of Ivwangtung by a narrow strait,
and Kwangtung, by about 20 affirmative
votes to 37 millions in the negative, recently
turned Bolshevik. The 20 votes represented
the ambassadors of Russia at present in
favor at the provincial capital, Gan ton. The
others were declared informal. Hainan for
once in a way remained blind to these
changes in its neighbor, so Canton sent a
Red army to enforce the dictatorship of the
proletariat. Largely officered by Russians,
the expeditionary army landed in broad day-
light and was opposed by many times its
number. But the Hainan army of defence,
being composed entirely of potential domestic
servants, saw no point in the bloody arbi-
trament of war. It retired into the precipi-
tous interior to wait until matters had been
adjusted and it could descend to accept tips
from the invaders. As a matter of principle
there was a little decapitation of officials
and some looting, and Hainan settled down
to its new role of being the furthest outpost
south of that enormous league of nations
which now stretches from the Baltic to the
frontier of Persia, and to the Sea of Okhotsk
in the east; and which with its peace and
unity of purpose makes the League centred
at Geneva look like a dogfight.
Other recent triumphs of the Soviet sys-
tem in China include the capture of Kuangsi.
This immense province has a population
larger than Australia. Its subjugation was
marked by the systematic destruction of
every idol in the country, Kuan-ti, God of
War, alone excepted. The pale, fana-
tic face of Lenin, with its black hirsute
frame, now gleams above the door-shrines
of many humble homes where formerly the
laughing Buddha savored the sweet smell of
the camel’s-dung incense-stick. Mongolia
some time ago declared its independence of
Peking and its afililiation with the Soviet
corporation, and a more recent suc-
cess was the capitulation of Chang,
the ruler of Manchuria, to Russian pressure.
The Red Bear, without having fired a shot,
is now in practically supreme command of
the old route via the Chinese Eastern Rail-
way to the warm waters of the Pacific, which
the late Czar waged a war and risked a
revolution to obtain. The recent firing on
foreign warships by the Taku forts is only
another local symptom of the same implac-
able determination. The Taku forts are an
old acquaintance of the British Fleet, which
has dusted their mud walls on various occa-
sions. They command the access to Tientsin,
another loathed outpost of Western capital-
ism ; and Tientsin is the port of Peking,
between which and the Mongolian border
sits Feng, the Christian general, _ holding
prayer meetings in the morning and instruct-
ing his officers in the use of Russian gas in
the afternoon. Mongolia, as I said before,
is now part of the Soviet League of Nations,
and a glance at the map will show that a
railway running from the Trans-Siberian at
Lake Baikal to Tientsin via Mongolia would
supply the Soviet with still another ice-free
outlet to the warm waters of the ocean that
provides the good surf-bathing at Manly
(N.S.W.).
There is a prevalent belief that the Soviet
is achieving these notable triumphs by
preaching communism. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Some of the coun-
tries affiliated to the Soviet system arc
frankly capitalistic, and the Soviet has
allowed them to remain so. In China the
social pyramid is based on the domestic
patriarch. The Christian missionaries have
labored more to upset that pyramid than
have the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks spread
a more attractive doctrine. It is hatred of
the British. Hate is a simple fundamental
virtue, congenial to about nine-tenths of the
human race, be they individualistic or com-
munist. And fuel to feed the hate is by
no means lacking. The new industrial sys-
tem of the treaty ports is the most abomin-
able dung-licap that ever stank to Heaven.
I once watched part of this dung-lieap being
swept out of existence by the only sanitary
authority which has ever been able to do
anything with it. Fire was that authority.
It started in a European mill and spread to
the terrace on terrace of packed lodging-
houses inhabited by the native workers.
Such is the pressure of existence on these
miserable creatures that imperturbable shop-
keepers continued to sell meals at one end
of the long building while fire was roaring
through the other end. In the cheaper of
these lodging-houses, men whose earnings
are not sufficient to keep them in warm
clothing can for less than a penny a night
lie down with 50 or 60 compatriots on a
litter of straw, while a blanket covering
the whole floor and with holes cut in it
roughly corresponding to the number of heads
of the guests is lowered from the ceiling.
Families rent from other families, enjoying
the unparalleled luxury of a whole room
to themselves, one corner of it, with the
right to sub-let portion thereof to another
tenant, if suitable. In these conditions the
Bolshevik orator finds a fertile field for his
propaganda. lie does not tell the starving
worker that his troubles are due to the fact
that his country is so over-supplied with
human beings that in some parts they fetch
alive a lower price than a brace of dead
fowls. He tells them earnestly to hate the
British.
Consequently British trade languishes un-
der a boycott whose effects extend to Britain.
There a shortage of work also .entails a sur
plus of workers, and the natural reluctance
of men to accept a lower .standard of life
finds expression in a general strike. Thus
Bolshevism progresses, with curious allies,
to what bourn who can foresee*'
FENG-SHUI.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Dreadful Shortage of Production.
N. S. Wales Opposition-leader Bavin, back
from Queensland, and finding a robust in-
dustrial disturbance awaiting him in Ins own
State, spoke a few words of wisdom to a
small audience and a good deal of desert
air. In a condensed form this was his text:
Many people maintain that opposition to the
44-hour week would disappear if the policy became
uniform over Australia. This is a disastrous fallacy.
Literally we cannot afford to diminish our present
producing capacity in the slightest degree.
Australia isn’t much of a place in which to
promulgate a gospel of that sort not at
present, anyhow, though it may awake to
the realities of life before it is too late to
mend, or else after. A strange assortment
of unpromising elements help to make up
the population of this big country. They
include: —
A small crowd of loan-jugglers who want or
think they want a revolution of one sort or another.
Thev have a great scorn for production, legal ding
national and general bankruptcy as a step towards
the pit they are aiming at,
A larger crowd of loan-jugglers who loathe the
idea of bankruptcy and revolution, but are heading
that way all the same because they have got started
and find it too much trouble to stop.
A still more numerous artisan class which sees
no promise in its drab existence except in a vicious
variety of politics. Any attempt to rise above the
nick by skill and industry is liable to lead to
industrial excommunication for doing too much work,
for not leaving off work, or even for piecework.
An importing class which does its utmost to
destroy the only kind of production that holds out
promise of indefinite or evefi considerable expansion.
It is also in the loan business, because a great
quantity of its goods are indirectly paid for in that
way.
An agricultural section to which the last-mentioned
especially address themselves, and which too fre-
quently lends an ear.
The trade returns for eight months of tin;
financial year have been issued, and they
certainly show that this is not the time for
diminishing “our present producing capa-
city.” Rather there is urgent need to increase
it on a big scale. The things we bought from
abroad represented £998,995 more, while the
things we sold abroad stood for £7,267,863
less, than in the same period of the previous
year. Therefore Australia is some 8y mil-
lion pounds further from meeting its bills
(including interest on loans) than at this
time 12 months ago, and is in for borrow-
ing that amount more in the foreign mar-
kets to avert open insolvency. The record of
last year was bad enough, and to achieve
something so much worse is monumental.
When the eight months’ foreign sales of
wool, wheat, flour, dairy produce, meat,
fruit and some sundries are added up, the
decline in these “primary” products
approaches £14,000,000. A huge increase in
the exports of sugar, which rose to
£5,236,773, would be cheering but for the
fact that this surplus was sold below the
cost of production, and that there is- talk of
mills closing because of the loss. Two small
luminous spots appear amid the gloom.
Thanks to the increased tariff the country
was able to do with £2,000,000 less of im-
ported woollens and other textiles, and had
that much more to spend on local‘industry.
Another point is that the export of Austra-
lian manufactured goods improved a little.
Manufactured goods bulk more largely in
Australia’s exports than tallow, timber, fruit
or wine, and they bulked more largely than
sugar until the disastrous sugar boom set
in. Still the position grows steadily worse.
If the Bruce-Page Ministry hasn’t an idea
of how to make exports balance imports and
interest bills it should advertise for sugges-
tions, and offer a series of prizes ranging
from £lO,OOO down to a tea-cosy.

The Peaceful Picket.
Surprise has been expressed in Britain at
Sir John Simon’s categorical cursing of the
general strike, which collapsed, as was inevit-
able, last week. But really there is nothing
to be surprised about. Certainly as a Radical-
Liberal Simon has always evinced a good
deal of sympathy with Labor’s industrial
aims—the securing of fair wages and decent
working conditions, the right to bargain col-
lectively and so forth. But, as one of the
soundest and most highly-feed of English
lawyers, he knows a rebellion when he sees
it brewing, and he denounces it whether it
is brewed in Belfast or in Bermondsey. His
reference to the legal liability of trades
unions in respect of damages sustained by
any person through their illegal acts is
merely a statement of the clearest of common-
law principles; the difficulty lies in sheeting
home the illegal acts of union members to
the organisation itself —a difficulty that is
greater, of course, in countries where the
reins of government are held by persons
owing no allegiance to the Labor movement
than in countries where the Labor movement
and the Government are intermingled. In
Sydney Labor leaders such as Jock Garden
can with safety ■ publicly outline the plans
they have formed for the discomfiture of the
employer—a very comprehensive programme,
embodying scarcely-veiled threats of sabotage
and job-control, has recently been disclosed
—but in Britain mum’s the word. The peace-
ful pickets who break men’s arms or throw
them in the river are instructed by their
union to peacefully picket—so far as the
records show—and if trains are stoned,
’buses overturned and policemen trampled
upon, there usually is not much evidence to
link the offences up with union headquarters.
The right of picketing, which is the starting
point for most of the violence that accom-
panies a hard-fought strike, is one for which
no real excuse exists at the present stage of
industrial history. It may have had its
legitimate place in the early days of trades
unionism, when manv working people were
ignorant of the issues involved in a strike,
but there is no such ignorance to-day. In
Britain, where there is no general statutory
pi-ovision for compulsorv arbitration of in-
dustrial disputes, the risrht to strike must
logically be conceded. But the right of the
employer to carry on his business, if he can,
without the men who refuse to work for him
is equally strong, and where his business is
the feeding of the public or providing it with
other necessaries of life the maintenance of
his right becomes of more importance,
nationally, than the right to strike. Ihe
privilege of picketing constitutes, under pre-
sent conditions, a strong menace to the right
of the community to protect itself, and it
ought to be withdrawn. Furthermore, m a
s( nsibly-conducted State, trades unions, in
time of strike, would be held responsible
for the acts of every one of their members.
Under such a dispensation, which would
recognise solidarity and the class-war, a
certain type of person, now very much m
evidence in union activities, would find its
welcome wearing extremely thin.

The Proposed Bonus on Gold.
Feed C. Overheu takes the stand for the
bonus on gold-production :
The gold-mining industry is as much entitled to
a bonus as the sugar industry. Gold-mining is
carried on by white labor, and a bonus of £1 per
ounce will create much further wealth and absorb
a large number of the unemployed. The bonus
could be provided out of the profits made on the
note issue, which is only possible by the backing
of gold.
The increased costs in all industries hit mining for
gold harder than any other industry, as its price
is now fixed, and costs cannot be passed on. Every
other industry has had a bonus, increased tariff
Protection or enhanced prices to cope with increased
costs. If Australia had Freetrade no bonus would
be required. The bonus could be worked on a sliding
scale —even 10s. would be equal to 2ldwt.— and many
of the large low-grade propositions now idle could
be worked, creating prosperous towns and large
i ndirect employment.
The Federal Government during the war com-
mandeered the gold produced, and it has been
proved that the mining industry lost over £3,000,000 ;
as soon as the Government allowed the Gold Pro-
ducers’ Association the free disposal of gold a pre-
mium of over 30s. per ounce was obtained. Sugar
was not commandeered and sold at pre-war parity.
Gold-mining in Westralia was the means of plac-
ing thousands again on their feet after the bank
smashes of the ’nineties. The State has produced
about £160,000,000 worth of gold and paid about
£55,000,000 in dividends. Besides the payment of
dividends fortunes were made in business and <,
thousands were able to make a start farming through 5
the saving of the high wages paid from gold
directly and indirectly.
Professor David says that W.A. so far has only
been scratched on the surface for gold. But it
takes money nowadays for prospecting below the
surface, and capital is shy owing to the disabilities
(tariff and taxation) the industry has had to put up
with since Federation. The fact must not be lost
sight of that a thriving gold-mining industry
attracts immigration of the right class —men with
grit and monej 7 —and wall indirectly greatly benefit
the Commonwealth through the Customs.
A few words in reply:—
(1) The gold-mining industry is not as much
entitled to a bonus as the sugar industry, inasmuch as
the latter is permanent' while the former is not.
Gold isn’t even so much entitled tc a subsidy as
coal, about which there is some row in England, for.,
coal is much more essential. And a lot of people
doubt if the sugar bonus is justifiable.
(2) If a bonus will “create much further wealth”
and absorb the Westralian unemployed, Westralia
might perhaps pay the bonus itself--—such things are
provided for under clause 91 of the Constitution.
It could tax the “further wealth”.-, and get back its
money, or it might apply to this purpose the next
cheque which it gets from the Commonwealth.
(3) The fact that the note issue is “only possible
by backing of gold” is no reason for the bonus.
Britain has plenty of gold to support its note issue,
yet it doesn’t spend money subsidising old Welsh or
Irish gold-mines, or those that the Scottish regalia
was made out of in back ages.
(4) To say that “every other industry has had
a bonus or increased tariff Protection’’ is foolish.
To quote one instance, The Bulletin sells at the
pre-war price, and still struggles to make a crust
in competition with the imported rags of many
countries.
(5) If the industry (which wasn’t wholly AVest-
ralian by any means) lost £3,000,000 through the
commandeering of gold during the war, the share-
holders were heavy losers, and an amazing proportion
of W.A. gold-mine shareholders live in the Eastern
States or elsewhere outside AV.A. If it is proposed
that the £3,000,000 loss be made good they will
thankfully receive- cheques for their shares. Mean-
while the commandeering business is ancient history.
(6) Too much fuss is made about the “tariff and
taxation” disabilities of AVestralia under Federation.
In the State’s last days of separation there were
some 900 items in the AV.A. tariff, including machinery
in general and “machinery unenumerated.” It was
the most Customs-taxed place in Australia, and
possibly in the world, the tariff revenue being over £5
per head in 1899-1900. The State Government loved
to tax gold-mining because it represented so much
foreign capital.
(7) Too much fuss is also made about what the AVest-
ralian gold business did to repair the financial
disaster of 1892-93. As late as 1896 AVestralia was
a smaller gold producer than N. S. AA'ales, Victoria
or Queensland, and represented only about one-eighth
of the Australian output. In the days of the
smash it was living on call money from outside.
The three other States named have also fallen on
lean times, and might like a subsidy.
(8) Too much bosh is talked about the untapped
areas and unscratched deposits of the “Great AA r est.”
They may exist there or anywhere, and they may not.
A recent Government record mentions 90 W.A. gold
companies as paying dividends between 1890 and
1923. The comb was so fine as to include one which
paid £46. The total was £28,380,706. ■ Eleven
mines paid £24,625,246. The other 79 were mostly
sinks for eastern money, absorbing much more than
they-paid. The 7990 or whatever the number was
which paid no divs. at all were w'orse. They were
scattered over 19 separate fields and over a twentieth
described as “State generally.”

Our Bad Friend Dengue.
“Ento” : The causative organism of dengue
fever is admittedly unknown, because it is
unseen (B. 6/5/’26), but. the transmitting
mosquito has been clearly identified. The
U.S. Medical Army Corps in the Philippines
ranks the scourge in that tropical land as
next in its ravages to tuberculosis, syphilis
and malaria. Three army doctors made a
special research on the epidemic, using
humans for their purpose, other animals
apparently being unaffected by it. There are
no less than 33 names for the disease, which
is transmitted by the day-biting, house-
haunting Aedes aegypti, the same mosquito
that transmits yellow fever, and is also called
Siegomyia fasciata. Both the pest and the
disease were apparently first noted in tropi-
cal America, the former being transported
thither by Columbus and other early navi-
gators, the disease itself following later.
Subsequently the mosquito was discovered in
Egypt in 1762 ; the first recognisable descrip-
tion of the epidemic was published in 1779.
The germ that causes dengue is ultra-
microscopic. The mosquito becomes affected
by biting a patient in the early stages of
the disease. After the lapse of 10 days the
mosquito is capable of transmitting the dis-
ease, and thence onward to the end of its
life, about two months later, retains this
infectivity. A person bitten by such a mos-
quito shows the first symptoms of the
disease any time between 4 and 15 days
afterwards. There appear to be no cases of
natural immunity. The immunity that follows
an attack is of a variable nature; there are
cases where the initial attack was followed
by another, 10 days elapsing between the
first symptoms developing in each case; there
are other instances of four attacks in 15
months; but few sutler more than two
attacks of any consequence. The symptoms
are now known in practically all variations
of the disease, only very mild cases being
difficult to diagnose. “M.B. 1922” had better
drop Osler as an authority and read Siler,
Hall and Hitchens, in the Philippine
Journal of Science (1926), where lie will
find all about the history, transmission, diag-
nosis and prevention of dengue, besides much
other matter relating thereto. Hundreds of
cases, all true to diagnosis, have come under
my observation in Queensland, the sufferers
including my wife, my daughter and myself.
During the recent epidemic in Brisbane few
inhabitants escaped, and none might have
done so if the summer had lasted another
three months. Although there may have
been no deaths directly due to this epidemic,
yet complications have set in on occasions
that proved fatal; also, cases are known in
the past history of Queensland where the
effects of depression brought about by dengue
in its severest form ended in suicide.

The Fear of Hurting Mother.
If one were to make a graph of the market
movements of shares in Maoriland industrial
ventures and'in financial concerns respec-
tively during the last dozen years the result
would be illuminating. The industrials
would make a sweep illustrating the fate
of the Gadarene swine, and the financials
would climb a slope as steep as Everest.
Manufacturing industry in the Shivery Isles
is not looked upon with any vast amount of
favor by either the political party in power
or the banking ring that keeps such a very
tight grip on the sinews of trade. 1 fence
it is not surprising to find George Elliot,
the little Auckland knight who holds the
semi-political job of chairman of the semi-
State Bank of New Zealand, writing in the
London Financial News this sort of thing:
New Zealand is not essentially a manufacturing
country >as Great Britain is, but a certain section
of the community appears to be attempting to convert
her into a manufacturing country by advocating a
considerable increase of Customs duties on imported
articles, forgetting that she- cannot have it both
ways. New Zealand cannot hope to sell her primary
products if, at the same time, she effectively bars
out the manufactures of people overseas who pur-
chase those primary products.... Should the United
Kingdom for any reason stop importing her primary
products, New Zealand would be a ruined community,
at any rate until she had established trade in other
markets.
That sort of thing, of course, sounds very
well in London, but it probably does not
make so strong an appeal in the little Do-
minion, where anybody who cares to look at
the Year Book can find out for himself
that Maorilanders, per . capita , pay a bigger
amount of Customs duties than any other
nation on earth and that without giving
any very effective protection to scores of new
industries that are struggling hard to get
a footing. The policy of developing hydro-
electric power resources, inherited by the Re-
formers from the liberals, is in essence a
policy of industrial development, but the
Reformers, financed by squatters and offi-
cered by cockies, have not yet realised it.
In Canterbury, where for over a decade there
has been cheap electric power from the
pioneer plant at Lake Coleridge, a surprising
number of new industries have been brought
into being—mostly chemical and metallurgi-
cal —but they lack aid from the State in the
way of protection, and they have to put
up a hard fight to get a bank overdraft. As
a sort of silent commentary on the situa-
tion, the banks represented by George
Elliot have lent during the first quarter of
the current year nearly a million more than
they have held by way of deposits, while,
the Dominion’s trading figures for the 12
months ended in March last show that im-
ports exceeded exports in value to the tune of
just on four and a third millions. A further
commentary of the self-explaining order is
provided by the fact that in the period
Maoriland imported from the United States
and Canada goods—mostly connected with
the automobile trade- —valued at over 12 mil-
lions, and sold to those countries goods
valued at about six and a half millions. The
idea that manufactures must not be encour-
aged for fear of upsetting Mother is a one-
eyed notion that catches no glimpse of the
fact that Mother’s worst handicap is over-
population. and that the best thing that
could happen to her and to millions of her
artisans would be to transplant them and
their skill and industry to less crowded cor-
kers of the Empire, and there protect them
against the foreigners’ fierce Competition.
«
Uncle Tom Scabbin’ in South Africa.
The two Houses of the S’African Union
entered into joint session to discuss—-and
eventually pass—the Color Bar Bill, that
being the local way of settling differences.
The object of the measure is to reserve for
{he white man certain trades or professions
or occupations which the white civilisation
has created and made possible. Failing this
there is a suspicion that the white man may
have to leave the country, as he is leaving
India, being undersold by murky brethren
furnished with a smattering of skill and
knowledge which the white man has also
made possible. Being left to themselves the
murky brethren would probably cease to
smatter, and it would doubtless be held as
the white man’s duty to go back and rebuild
the fallen edifice of culture—and then move
away again. The black African is a great
loser of civilisations, and it isn’t safe to
leave him alone with one for any length of
time. He isn’t much given to increase unless
there is a paler race to look after him, and
he has spasmodic periods of diminution over
great spaces by reason of war, massacre,
human sacrifices, cannibalism, slavery, etc.
lie has been a wliaio for selling his brother
at a moderate figure, and tin Abyssinians,
supposed to be Christians of a sort, are re-
ported to be busy to-day depopulating large
adjacent areas in the effort to supply their
own market and fill rush orders elsewhere.
But when looked after and forced to keep
a measure of peace and quiet, Ham is apt
to develop an embarrassing tendency to mul-
tiplication. The Union has a purely white
civilisation, in which respect it differs from
India, wlich bad a colored civilisation before
the European turned up. It is climatically
a white man’s land according to the hack-
neyed idea that Japiietii should stick to cool
places, which is to say that only one corner
of it extends into the tropics. Though its
biggest city, Jo’burg, is nearly inside the
tropical line it is some 6000 ft. above sea-
level, and cold enough at times to make any-
body miserable. In short, the Union is a
white man’s country with too many black
people (78 per cent., to be exact) in it. It
is arriving at the point that the folk of Euro-
pean descent must reserve for tlieir own sup-
port some of the occupations they have
created, or they must begin to decay. The
Lower House, which is the more democratic
body of the two, passed the Color Bar Bill
with little or no hesitation, but the Senate,
consisting of property-holders aged over 30,
rejected it. The Senate was strong on the
alleged moral aspect that no man should be
penalised by reason of liis color, but as no
man Can sit in either Chamber unless he is
“a British subject of European descent,” it
would appear that Black Brother is penalised
already, and that the Senators profit by the
fact. A considerable mass of pious and other
elements have rushed, and are rushing, into
print with the statement that it is sinful
to draw a color line, but they neglect to
indicate any other line, and a line of some
sort is essential. Owing to the size of the
fuss, a vague idea, prevails that the Union
of S’Africa is a huge country, and that bad
white men are out to steal a continent.
Though the place has made a great deal of
history it is really much smaller than West-
ralia, Queensland or the Northern Territory,
and not much more commodious than South
Australia, whereas the African continent is
four times the size of Australia. Ham, how-
ever, is a poor hand at making or preserving
cities of his own; he prefers to pervade the
white man’s towns as a cheap non-union
worker. Which might be called a new edi-
tion of Uncle Tom Scabbin’.
+ _—
The Gold Thief.
Crimes of violence have been singularly few,
all things considered, on the W.A. goldfields,
but the illicit-treatment plant has taken a
heavier toll at last than it ever levied on
ore stolen from the Golden Mile. If the re-
voltingly callous murderers of Detectives
Walsh and Pitman are brought to justice,
it will be a strain even on a Labor Govern-
ment to find reason for remitting the death
penalty, so deliberate was the killing, so
hideous in every aspect the crime. For the
past 10 years Detective-inspector Walsu
had been the head of the police staff (subsi-
dised by the Chamber of Mines) whose
special business is the detection and preven-
tion of gold-stealing. What dimensions this
stealing has attained in the past will never
be known; sensational allegations made 20
years ago by a goldfields warden caused the
Government of the day to appoint what came
to be known as the Gold Leak Commission,
which failed to sheet home guilt to anyone,
though there was no doubt that quantities of
rich stone never went to swell the monthly
returns; they were spirited away to pri-
vate treatment plants, and once there the
difficulties of establishing where the stuff had
come from were practically insuperable. The
receiver is generally a much warier bird than
the thief, and the owner of a private treat-
ment plant was mostly the receiver. Some-
times he ran a mine—or, at all events, a few
shafts and stopes—in connection with his
plant, and declared the gold, when he sold
it to the bank, as having come from there.
Mostly he bought ore or treated it for his
customers, careless of where it came from.
Public opinion w r as never unduly hard with
regard to methods that in any other industry
would have been uncompromisingly con-
demned ; probably it never is when goldfields
of vast productiveness are steadily enriching
shareholders. Still, the Gold Leak Commis-
sion had some good effects; it gave the
private treatment plant and its loose or
dishonest methods more publicity than such
a business could stand. Regulations were
tautened up, and it is. only reasonable to
assume that ore which is rich enough to be
worth stealing has been mostly treated of
late years with such rough and ready appli-
ances as could be managed in some spot that
would be likely to be secure from prying
eyes. Inspector Walsh, an indefatigable
officer, the greater part of whose 35 years
in the force had been spent upon the gold-
fields, had for years been matching his wits
against the bandits of the goldfields at a
game where it is almost essential that the
malefactor be taken in the act. He must
often have had to deal with dangerous men,
yet the penalty for being in possession of
gold that cannot be lawfully accounted for
has never been so heavy, or perhaps the
prospect of ill-gotten gain so substantial, as
to suggest that there were those in the
traffic who would not hesitate at the most
diabolical crime if detection and arrest were
imminent. Maybe if there had been less
glossing over of dishonesty and criminality
and more drastic legislation to discourage
the gold thief and the receiver in the past,
the goldfields might have been spared its
latest tragedy.

tralian article compares more than favorably
with the Yankee variety, the difference
in price is very slight without the duty,
and the price of the foreign article would
certainly soar if there was no Australian
competition. However, as a mallee farmer,
I pass on to the farmers’ grievance—the
tariff on implements. The Minister cpioted
the cost of machinery on a mallee farm at.
£OO4, and stated that the average cost due
to the tariff was 124 per cent., or £75. I
consider the Minister's estimate of £604 too
low by at least £2OO, so that on my estimate
the amount paid in duty would' be £lOO.
A cvertheless, most mallee farmers will agree
v ith me that the most durable and efficient
implements' amongst stumps are those made
in Australia specially for mallee conditions.
My plant, with the exception of an old
l ankee binder which I hope shortly to be
able to scrap and replace with one of Aus-
tralian manufacture, is wholly Australian-
made, and I am confident that I have
implements which can be relied upon for the
maximum of efficiency in this class of
country. The same applies to the farms of
all my neighbors. Practically the only
imported implement to be seen is the Yankee
binder, and after seeing Australian-made
binders at work I am satisfied that they are
equal, it not superior, to this. In spite
of being quite satisfied with their Australian-
made implements, however, many farmers are
out for Freetrade because it means cheaper
motor-cars. Surely the Australian imple-
ment-manufacturer has deserved well of liis
customers in that his machinery has already
cut many a wages-bill in halves and bids fair
to wipe it right out in the case of the
«mall farmer by enabling him to run his
farm single-handed. The profit he makes is
spent m Australia; were the duties re-
mitted, much of what the farmer puts into
machinery would go to the land of take-all-
and-give-nothing— the U.S.A.
The End of the British Strike.
The healthiest feature of the ending of the
general strike in Britain is the admission
ot some of the union leaders nominally re-
sponsible that their action was not only ille-
gal but dishonest. Otherwise the history of
the strike is but an old story re-told. Mis-
led Tabor on such occasions goes in like a
lion and comes out like a lamb—a lamb
whose innocence is so excessive that the mere
notion that it can be held in any way re-
sponsible for the things it did when it
thought it was a lion is sufficient to reduce
it to astonishment. To a very great extent
this assumption of irresponsibility is tin'
product of the union of industrialism and
politics—it is not found to any great extent
tor instance, in the United States, where the
j.abor organisations keep out of politics. It
,s a product, too, of the teaching of the re-
volutionaries who represent to the worker
that he is a poor, foolish, witless creature
held in bonds of slavery by superlatively
cunning masters, who use Church, Law,
Army. Navy and State as means of riveting
Ihe shackles more firmly on the workers’
wnsts. You have nothing to lose but your
chains, cries the Red leader, and the work-
ers, believing him, go forth to lose two or
three weeks wages, perhaps a month or so
m liberty and years of seniority in service.
Vw , a J" e len t°ld that these sacrifices and
tribulations are merely stepping-stones upon
the road to the Anarchical Arcadia or the
Co-operative Commonwealth; that the
worker has, after all, something more than
chains to lose is thus neatly side-tracked. The
worker is now brought face to face with a
great tact. He finds he is responsible for
what his leaders do because he is responsible
for the choice of leaders; and for the first
time lie has been told, by themselves, that
leaders are not infallible. On this occasion
they have confessed that they erred, and
wrongfully counselled the breakingof contracts
that ought to have been faithfully observed,
llie worker has been told by the ■ erring
leaders themselves that he must take the
consequences of following them, and be
thankful those consequences arc no worse
He has even been invited (in the case of
J. 11. 1 no.was and the railway companies)
to admit the magnanimity of the other side
in not visiting the sins of the leaders upon
the followers in a much more unpleasant
manner. The lesson is one which, if it
sticks, may do more for the workers of Bri-
tain than all the doles and subsidies with
which politicians have cajoled them. It may
bring organised Labor to recover its con-
science ; and nothing much can go wron° -
n it does that. ”

The Baml of Topsy-turvy Politics.
Queensland has been Labor in State poli-
ties since 1915 and anti-Labor in Federal
politics since 1917; and in that topsy-turvy
condition if will remain for another three
.'ears, barring accidents, as a result of the
two recent appeals to the people Tlier«
has been nothing like it in Australia since
the Commonwealth was established, nor is
it probable that the U.S.A. or Canada could
furnish a parallel. At the Federal election
m November Political Labor retained one
House of Reps, seat after a hard fight, and
might have retained a second but for ex-
Speaker McDonald’s death just before poll-
ing-day (Senate voting suggests that he
would have won by a thousand or so), but
in the other eight electorates it was un-
mercifully trounced. For the Senate seats
it was beaten by 214.000 to 160,000; it has
tailed to elect a Senator since 1914. Yet the
same party has won another sweeping vie-
tol7 ? t „^ ll . c election. .It had 43 seats
out ot <2 in the last Parliament, and though
hard pressed in half a dozen constituencies
.held the whole 43. This consistent rever-
sal of form has its humorous side (though
the humor is not relished by those who will
have to pay, in direct taxation, for three
more years of State Labor government), and
it is variously accounted for. Some more or
less plausible explanations follow:
(1) The swing of the pendulum. That implement
swings towards Labor after a Nat.-Cocky triumph
at the polls, and towards the Nat.-Cookies after a
Labor success. The greater the victory in one sphere
the greater the reaction in the other. It is recalled
that Westralian Labor wen 34 out of 50 Assembly
seats in 1911, and at the ensuing House of Reps,
election lost three out of five.
(2) The t ederal Nat.-Cookies, being reasonably
young and progressive, appealed to that large section
of the electors who are young and progressive them-
selves. The Queensland Opposition, being burdened
with dismal old-timers, carried no such appeal ; and
it offered the spectacle of a belated and not’very
harmonious coalition, instead of a friendly alliance
which has lasted unimpaired for three years. It
was handicapped by personal and sectional animosities
which did not operate against the Bruce-Pages, and
PROUD OF IT.
"Mr. Lang deseribed the 44 Hour Act recently as an epochal achievement for Labor.' It has
resnlted in a tremendous amount of unemployment directly and probably quite as much indirectly in
N. S. Wales, along with increased industrial unrest throughout Australin."
MR. LANG: "Don't forget it was I who gave you the gave you the gunpowder."
in energy and the arts of electioneering' it was
decidedly inferior to its opponents.
(3) There is a fairly widespread feeling that
Queensland can stand a State Labor Government so
long as there is a Commonwealth anti-Labor Govern-
ment to hand out tariff Protection, an embargo on
sugar imports, capitation, railway and road grants,
bounties on beef, canned fruit, power alcohol and
other Queensland commodities, and loans or loan
guarantees.
(4) There are 40,000 Government employees who
control at least one-fourth of the total votes, perhaps
one-third. The majority of these persons feel that
their fortunes are bound up with the fortunes of the
party which stands for Government ownership and
which, in thousands of cases, gave them their jobs,
lhey can have no such feeling at Commonwealth
elections, their jobs not being menaced in the
remotest degree.
(5) The Commonwealth electoral boundaries'favor
no party, the electorates being equal in population,
as tar as it can be arranged. The State boundaries
favor the Labor party to an outrageous extent. Vnd
State elections are always held on inflated rolls.
None of the influences mentioned is incon-
siderable, and the course of events was pro-
foundly affected by (4) and (5). It is cer-
tain that many of those who voted anti-
Labor in November voted Labor in May:
® e ftain, nevertheless, though returns are
still drifting in, that the Labor total in the
bb contested elections was less than the
Opposition total. So the new Leg. Assem-
bly will be a mockery of the principle of
majority rule; but that will be no novelty
for Queensland.
Adelaide has had another sensational mur-
der trial, with the usual acquittal. A hotel-
keeper s wife left him for another man. The
husband followed them to Willunga, 30 miles
south, found them living there and shot the
man dead. He had picked up a stranger on
the road and taken him along as a witness;
also he called at the Willunga police-station
on the way to inquire if the constable there
knew the whereabouts of the pair. Vil-
leneuve Smith, for the defence, boldly
threw over any Unwritten Law plea. The
husband s version was that he had merely
gone to get his wife back, had gone armed
in tear of consequences, and had fired in self-
defence on seeing the other man stoop as
tor a weapon. And the jury let it go at that,
the form of verdict “Good enough for the
cow. has not yet found its way on to the
statute-books, but all the States have lately
accepted it in a practical way.
♦
Tns function of a jury, according to Judge
Dethkidge (Vic.), is to give its true-saying
and then hold its tongue. It is put very
explicitly in court—“ What say you, guilty
or not guilty?” Beyond the one or the
other anything they would like to say is
irrelevant, and though Judges may in the
past have listened to such addenda as recom-
mendations to mercy, Judge Dethrtdge is
not inclined their way. He had before him
in general sessions a young man, aged 21.
charged with having broken and entered a
house at Footscray. The prisoner was de-
fended by Mr. Manchester, who apparently
delivered soft goods to the jury, for when
finding his client guilty they tacked on a
strong recommendation to mercy—he was
young, and looked so innocent, and the .jury
did not think he was the-prime mover in
the offence. Then the record of the prisoner
was read, and it appeared that he had several
previous convictions. The Judge asked the
good men and true if they still recommended,
and, having put their wise heads together,
they took it back. It was then ’g Honor got
home. "The whole system of bringing in
recommendations to mercy is extraneous to
the functions of a jury,” he declared. “It
is not part of a jury's legal duty. and. in
fact, it is not its legal privilege.” Yet if
the recommendation goes the present jury
system becomes still more inadequate; for
.ten the only way of roping in an outstand-
ing juryman is by promising him the addi-
tion of this sop.

►Some day, perhaps a hundred years hence,
citizens of this country will look back on
items like the following with the same won-
der and incredulity we bestow on that period
in our history when lunatics were publicly
flogged to restore them to their senses. The
item in question is a complaint voiced by the
chairman of a children’s court in Perth that
he was powerless to do anything in the case
betpre him, which was the second degenerate
child of a mother 22 years of age, who had
previously brought into the world and the
care of the State a mentally-unsound infant.
•u? exhibit is a child with truly hor-
rible deformities. The prodigy was also
committed to the care of the State, but no
other action except to wait for further re-
sults could be taken.
♦
In a country where the public hospitals de-
pend for their existence upon frequent and
frenzied shaking of collection-boxes at street
corners, and where fire-brigade members
spend much of their time selling art-union
tickets, the charitable-minded stand in no
need of new avenues for their philanthropy.
Nevertheless a new avenue has been found
arfo »™ e , where the State branch of the
b.I.C.A. is endeavoring—and very success-
tully—-to create a wave of sentiment suffi-
ciently gilt-edged to finance an institution
tor the care of aged and infirm horses. The
movement is being made a peg on which to
hang various society junketings which would
take place in any case—a peg is never want-
ing—and everyone concerned in the fatuous
business is probably enjoying it. But the
sources of charity, however stimulated by
jazz balls and bridge parties, are not un-
limited and it is a pity to see money that
might be used, for example, to give a'better
chance to young human beings born under
handicapping circumstances, devoted to main-
taining the existence of beasts whose useful-
ness is ended, and who would be the sub-
ject of no moral injustice were they pain-
lessly despatched. Australia pays enormous
tribute to the horse, and there are stern
moralists who think the extermination of
r.M amma l would be good for the nation
they may be wrong, but not as far wrong
as the sentimentalists who divert money from
the hospitals to keep crocks in clover

After holding a special session to decide
where it would best like the new St.
Andrew’s Cathedral to grow when the old one
js uprooted from the site beside the Sydney
Town Hall, the Anglican Synod, by an'over-
whelming vote, decided to ask the Govern-
ment to grant the block where the Mint
and the District Court buildings now
moulder. They are not likely to get it, since
the Government visions the resumption of
whole of that block for Government
buildings, with new law-courts on this par-
ticular site. According to town-planner
John Sitlman the choice was, in any case,
ill-advised ; another church, the ancient and
historic St. James’s, is alongside; and the
new cathedral would clash architecturally
With St. Mary's and the Registrar-General’s
building. Sulman favors the Church Hill
site—with a suggestion that one right out-
side the city might be better. Church Hill
otters a position in an open square which
will stand facing one of the gateways of the
city when the North Shore bridge is opened ;
also, it will have two stations of the city
railway system, one on Circular Quay and
the other at Wynyard-square, close handy.
Lang offered the Anglicans half a million
compensation, as well as a site there in
exchange for the present St. Andrew’s land,
and there is a lot in those figures to make
them satisfied with Church Hill, especially
as the place has historic religious associa-
tions.

lx the ordinary course of their daily toil the
engineers of the Commonwealth Telegraphs
have just done a bit of pioneering and ex-
ploring - in unknown and trackless wastes
quite as meritorious as the Polar flutters to
which so much space is being given in Aus-
tralian papers. An alternative line between
Perth and Wyndham, in the farthest nor’-
west, had to be laid, and the way was in-
land over country never previously hoofed by
white men. Three thousand steel beams had
to be erected, and water had to be trans-
ported, or obtained by sinking bores. For
102 days the mercury climbed over the 100
mark; one day it, bubbled up to 120. In the
course of the operations, which lasted a year,
the. camel was declared a back number and
the motor-truck put to a job which it had
never faced before. The office pessimists
said the vehicle was madness; but the pro-
position that holds up the bush Australian,
with his astonishing capacity for getting out
of tight corners, lias to be more than merely
mad—it lias to be gibbering.

POLITICAL
POINTS
If the rest of the financial year is like the
first nine months the Commonwealth and
States wall have to float 20 millions or so of
new loans abroad in order to get real coin
to pay interest on old loans. It is the old
trouble of exporting too little and importing
a darned sight too much. All the seven Gov-
ernments would suddenly arrive at much the
same condition as Tasmania is in if they
stopped their extraneous borrowing, or %en
it' they cut it down as Tasmania lately did.
Some day there may be a Federal Ministry
which will confront the problem, but it
hasn’t arrived yet. Meanwhile there is a
prospect of a fine paper surplus, caused by
the increase in Customs revenue paid in
paper, the cause of that being excessive im-
porting. Freetraders urge this paper sur-
plus as a reason why duties should be re-
duced so that there may be more importing.
While denying that Federation has “sub-
stantially depreciated” the position of Tas-
mania and Westralia, the Commonwealth
Government proposes to allow the Speck
£478,000 p.a. for tw r o years. The £478,000
includes the present “special” and roads
grants, which amount to £168,000 p.a.; the
other £310,000 is for railway interest and
sinking fund. Westralia is promised
£300,000 for five years to meet the interest
on £5,000,000 of its accumulated deficit
(£6.200,000) ; in addition, the Commonwealth
offers to take over 528,000 square miles of
the Nor'-West. The money will be accepted,
of course, but the land won’t be so readily
given away. With all their shortcomings,
Westralian Governments haven’t made as
bad a job of their North-West as Federal
Governments have made of the Northern
Territory.
A cable item showing the Yank at his
best :
Wool-top - millers at a Boston luncheon told Mr.
Marks, president of the Austral-American Co. of
New York (formed to push the sale of Australian
goods in the U.S.), that they were determined not
to allow the entry of Australian manufactured tops.
....They would move Washington to increase the
tariff.... Mr. Marks said Australia wanted to in-
crease her population. “Why?” was the reply.
“Aren’t you happy and prosperous now? Continue
your production of raw materials and we will stay
friends.” '
What a friend! In 1923 the Yank sold us
goods costing £24,851,000 and bought from
us to the value of £9,630,000; balance
in favor of Uncle, to keep his factories open
and ours closed, £15,221,000. In 1924 he
sold us £34,556,000 worth, and bought from
us £7,109,000 worth; balance in favor of
Uncle, £27,447,000. And he still wants the
earth. Australia must reduce its imports,
for the continued floating of loans to pay
people like Uncle will spell certain bank-
ruptcy, and this, particular cormorant is
the person to begin with. Forbearance is
wasted on speed-cranks of this sort, but an
elaborate differential tariff might appeal to
him.
At the end of the first day's scrutiny in
Queensland Labor had scored 167.019 votes,
and Anti-Labor 179,199. Yet Labor was
leading in 38 electorates out of 66 —it had a
majority of 10 seats on a minority of 12,180
votes.
The 44-lxour-week disturbance in N. S.
Wales has been followed by the expected
coal strike. In each case bodies of unionists,
led by asses and demoralised by politicians,
have refused to observe awards which they
themselves sought, and have thereby shown
their contempt for tribunals which were set up
at their instance and in their interests. There
have been bitter comments on the fact that
Premier Lang, the blatant architect of ruin,
has been qbsent since the trouble began. For
the sake of appearances he should certainly
be at. his post, although in Australia, as in
Britain, political Labor-leaders are useless
for settling strikes, though _ they have a
lamentable aptitude fqr bringing them on.
N. S. Wales has a just ground for com-
plaint in the appointment of three union
leaders as “impartial chairmen” of the con-
ciliation committees under the new Arbitra-
tion Act —Amram Lewis, treasurer of the
Miners’ Federation; W. 11. Read, of the
Boilermakers’ Union; and F. Landon, who
left the secretaryship of the Pastrycooks’
Union to set up his plate as an industrial
advocate. The other two chairmen are M. G.
McWilliam, the blind barrister, and T. 11.
Jackson, who has been chairman of the City
THE MAN WITH THE HOE.
“Vic. Premier Allan, speaking at a meetig of the Farmers’ Union, told the world that, though he
was Premier, he was just as he was on the farm.”
THE BOSS COCKY: “None o’ your new-fangled ideas here—the old hoe's good enough
for me!”
Council Conciliation Committee. The em-
ployers however, need have very little fear
of Kavanagh, M.L.C., who becomes Deputy-
Industrial Commissioner. Even back in his
early Trades Hall days Kavanagh used to
irritate his fellow-unionists by insisting on
giving consideration to the other side’s case.
When Cochrane went into Parliament
Kavanagh became secretary of the Labor
Council, and McGowen put him in his first
batch of appointees to the Upper House.
It is mainly Lang’s 44-hour week which is
causing a company atAlbury to move its butter
factory across the border. The lesser hours,
it is explained, render it impossible for .the
factory to compete with those on the Vic-
torian' side of the Murray, already advant-
aged by lower taxation, so it is to be shifted.
As regards taxation, companies pay 2s. 6d.
in the £ on their profits in N. S. Wales and
Is. 3d. in Victoria. This consideration was
ignored by the authors of the Forty-four
Week Bill, but wagepay.ers can’t ignore it.
The Queensland election results are a poor
advertisement for that “united action against
the common enemy” which Tory editors
continually recommend. The Nationalists
and Cockies went in for “united action
against the common enemy” and fared worse
than when they fought each other briskly,
as in 1920. Political Labor has seldom won
against two parties with a cordial under-
standing, like the Bruces and the Pages,
but it has been very successful against coali-
tions. “Britain does not love coalitions,”
said Disraeli on a memorable occasion, and
Australia has inherited the aversion from
the Old Man.
It now looks as if the A’ic. Assembly re-
distribution trouble will be settled by con-
ceding the city six more seats —27 instead of
21. To do this it will be necessary to take
three off the country (allotting it 41 instead
of 44) and creating three extra constituen-
cies. In 1913 Watt’s scheme for 70 seats
(46 for the country and 24 for the city)
was defeated. Watt was prepared to give
60 electors in the country as much power
as 100 in the city. On the present enrol-
ment 29 seats for the city out of 70 would
mean 100 metropolitan to 55 country voters ;
and 27 city seats out of 68 would work out,
in voters, at 100 to 51. It looks lopsided;
but the plan of setting up the big cities as
separate States is the only way to avoid that.
Ghosts were again plentiful at the Queens-
land elections. The State rolls contained
80,000 more names than the Commonwealth
rolls. Those used at the 1923 elections con-
tained 70,000 more names than the Common-
wealth rolls, but a few months later 80,000
names were struck off. Presumably this
operation will be repeated, and the ghosts
will return to the cemeteries until they are
wanted again in 1929.
Conclusions of a canvasser: —
What the Opposition needs most in Queensland is
a League of Youth. The party is burdened with old
traditions and old men. For Merthyr, a seat which
could have been won easily by a younger and brighter
candidate, it ran an old stager, whose chief claim
to consideration was that he had been for 10 years
a member of the Leg. Council. And this at a time
when Labor speakers’ scornful references to “the
old ziffs of the Council” were evoking cordial re-
sponses. The younger men, such as McGill in South
Brisbane, Tedman in Maree and Mighell in Herbert,
put up gallant fights against odds and reduced the
Labor majorities to a remarkable extent. Russell of
Dalby, who stood as a Primary Producers’ candidate,
not only defeated Vowles, a former Opposition-leader,
but a Labor candidate as well. With young men and
new methods the Opposition could capture Queens-
land and hold it as the Federal National Cockies have
done. But the old Parliamentary hands are hopeless.
The N.S.W. Public Works Committee has
decided again, as well-informed people knew
it would, that “it is not expedient to con-
struct a railway from Bombala to Twofold
Bay” Of course it isn’t expedient—from
the One Big City’s point of view. But no
Public Works Committee is ever honest
enough to add those few words and tell the
whole truth. The excision of the big cities
and their erection into separate States
seems the best if not the only hope. Then
if the country districts want to go to the
Devil they can, but they won’t be able to
blame their big city for pushing them.
A pleasant instance of the toleration with
which the Reds regard freedom of opinion
in those opposed to them is seen in some
recent suggestions for “dealing with” N.S.W.
employers who insist on the observance ot
Federal awards. It lias been suggested that
the State Labor Government should not only
refuse all contracts in future to firms which
adhere to the 48-hour week, but cancel those
already existing, in addition to “taking
over” the enemy’s plant and works. I'iven
the Lang Government is hardly ass enough
for that, but how the brethren of the wig
and gown must wish that it was!
“ Jackeroo” : The Yankee movies are not
in it with Queensland Labor politicians when
it comes to dealing out “sob stuff.” The
Opposition foolishly trusted to Labor’s sorry
bungling of the finances and Arthur Moore s
photograph. Moore is a good-looking chap,
but good looks didn't count when Labor
howled that the Tories would reduce wages.
Brisbane was plastered with posters depict-
ing sobbing widows, heart-broken mothers,
ill-nourished babies and starving orphans.
But the posters were not in the drama of
tears with some of the meetings. At the
final rally at Ithaca, Ma State’s Lang was
the draw-card. There was no cheering, but
much weeping. Aid. Warmington presided,
and led off with a harrowing picture of the
wage-slaves under the Fuller Government.
Then Lang appeared in the second act of
“East Lynne,” and when he had finished
with the unfortunate widows' and orphans
there wasn’t a dry eye in the crowd. Hanlon,
the Labor candidate, completed the tearful
deluge. He told between sobs about a poor-
old man that he used to draw rations for
under the Denham Government. And that’s
how elections are won these days.
With Tasmania’s usual luck the British
strike happened at the season when its apples
were arriving in the Cold Country, and the
Baldwin Ministry’s arrangements for the dis-
tribution of provender didn’t include such
things. It had all it could do to shift
absolutely essential dry victuals and baby’s
milk supply, without which latter there
might not have been much baby. But the
small island has grown so accustomed to
trouble that it begins to get dispirited. In
fact its Government adheres to the resolve
to reduce taxation and hang the consequences
.—at the worst they are more likely to be tin-
creditor’s consequences than the State’s. Last
financial year the Government performed
the astounding feat of dragging £6 Is. Sd.
per inhabitant out of the poorest community
in the Commonwealth; this in addition to
Federal imposts and local rates. But it
doesn’t propose to attempt any repetition of
the miracle—it fears the population might
leave on masse.
In the affair of the Newmarket cattle-
yards the Vic. Allan Government has once
more shown how things should not be done.
Farmer John asked his Town-planning Com-
mission for an.inquiry and report on a new .
site. The experts took eight months to con-
sider the thing important details like
heights, levels, drainage, supply of water, and
statistics re sources of supply had to be
considered —and finally recommended an area
south-west of Sunshine, about seven miles
from Melbourne. Meantime, however, the
Government secured an option over a site
selected by its sapient self. The Commis-
sion is now sulking in its tents, the Allan
crowd is trying to justify its choice, and the
removal of the original offence appears to be
as far off as ever.
The world is too full of sugar, which means
that the export of Queensland’s surplus may
be met by dumping duties on the ground that
the goods are sold abroad for less than at
home. That will make it difficult to dispose
of. even at a ruinous loss. The production
of white-labor sugar slumped greatly in
Europe during the war, but is moving along
again. The output of France, for instance,
was only 108,000 tons in the worst year
while the Hun was around, but it lately
rose to 447,000 tons, and there are hopes of
soon getting hack to the pre-war level
(878,000 tons). A country which depends
extensively, as Australia does, on selling
foodstuffs so that it may pay for imported
manufactures finds lots of competition.
Sydney aldermen have resolved that the
trams should be removed from the city
streets, though nothing was said about re-
moving the debt on them. This is in imita-
tion of London. But Sydney hasn't London's
system of subterranean railways, and makes
slow progress towards getting the semblance
of one. Last census showed, too, that
Greater Sydney was accumulating population
faster than Greater London, which was an
insane proceeding when there are so few
people and so many square miles. It seems,
moreover, on a rough estimate, to have about
2 per cent, of London’s police to arrest the
frenzied motorist who drives on the wrong
side, which tramcars never do ; and it pos-
sesses a very frenzied brand of motorist.
TOO CENSORIOUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Bavin stated that the Labor Government
had invited supporters to make suggestions regarding
the best means of redistributing the electorates.
This sinister move might be accepted as a warning
of what sort of redistribution the country was likely
to get.”
Gerrymander? Load the dice?
Heaven forefend!
Deem not to such foul device
We’d descend.
Still, when redistributing
Seats, ’twould be a thankless thing
If a fellow were to fling
Down a friend.
Name your preferences, gents;
Indicate
Where you’d like a zigzag fence,
Where a straight.
Be it north or south or west,
Whatsoever you suggest
May conceivably be best
For the State.
Not for nothing may you claim,
Trusty souls,
That you’re wise to every name
On the rolls.
Voters you can group and bunch
Till they’ll carry—-it’s a hunch—
Quite a swingeing party punch
At the polls.
There are seats you must have classed
Easy stuff,
Show us how you’d like ’em cast
In the rough,
Shaped and trimmed and pruned and decked
To the very best effect
So that you will be th’ elect
Sure enough.
Gerrymand’ring? Stacking cards?
God forbid!
But a chap must study his pards;
Whether hid
Or disclosed, it’s in the game.
If he didn't, just the same
His detractors would proclaim
That he did.

There is to be an issue of 125,000 ordin-
aries at par, and shareholders won’t leave
many on the directors’ hands. It was a
good 12 months —the best since the post-war
boom. Considering the dislocation of ship-
ping caiused by the strike of seamen on the
Australian coast and, later, the trouble with
the British seamen, plus a loss through a
collision between the Marella and an oil-
tanker near Singapore, the profits read ex-
ceptionally well. Given anything like normal
conditions this year, some hefty figures
should result. There is no doubt about the
co. s capacity to find 10 p.c. for the new
issue even with only moderate conditions—
last years profit could have done it with
more than £OO,OOO to spare. But 8.-P. man-
agement is not likely to ask for capital unless
it has good use for it. Nothing is said as
to the purpose for which it is needed, but
the co. has plenty of avenues where that sum
and more can be given a trot. The directors
recorded that merchandise operations were
well maintained at all branches. They could
have added that in most of the co.’s island
activities, including those of its big sub-
sidiary, the recovery from the slump con-
tinued, if conditions were not actually back
to normal. A broad hint of the improve-
ls contained in the record amount
nntten off for depreciation, losses, etc. Here
are the sums for the past nine years:—

How much of that was necessary this
wouldnt like to swear, but it sus-
pects that there is a wad of profits in that
figure. As it is, profits of the introductory

Sternly progress is reported. Further trad-

hold island of Nassau, which is fully planted
with cocoanuts, was purchased. The auxili-

term, and the co. added to its list the
steamers Makatia, Malinoa and Malanta and
the auxiliary schooner Tokelau.

Theie is an echo of the Melbourne venture
U J a statement that the sale of the assets
of that short-lived subsidiary is nearly com-
pleted :
So far as can be ascertained, the loss on realisation
'l-Pf . saleable assets there, excluding the building,
Lich 1S being retained for the present, will amount
to about £12,500. Against this probable small
loss on its investment, the co. (as a result of the
Melbourne liquidation) is receiving the benefit, as
Dorn October 1, 1925, of a saving in its cable costs for
a period of 10 years of approximately £12,000 p.a.
That problem having been disposed of so satis-
factorily, the Sydney City Council’s uncon-
scionable delay over the Martin-place re-
sumptions gave the board something to worry
about. Lately that matter, too. was more
or (ess finalised, leaving the co. to face the
necessity of erecting new premises: it had
foreseen the possibility some years ago and
pm cii used Yv entworth Court liour by sis si
site. But once more the council got in the
way, and the first plans have had to be torn
because of a belated decision to'widen
frnnnn/l 1 -street. The directors arc claiming
toUO,OOO on account of the resumption, in-
cluding costs of removal and disturbance of
business. Freehold premises were in the
b°°ks on March 28 at £189,821; the figure
in 1925 was £108,817. but since then tin'
co. has- erected a building in another part
o the city housing a small but complete
! aat 7 New premises have been erected
also for the Newcastle paper. There is thus
a Y ei 'y Wlde margin between the amount
claimed and the book value of the affected
property. As against that has to be set
tne tact that a large amount of capital will
be unproductive while the new home is being
E / en so ’ however, there are possi-
bilities of a substantial payment in excess
or the book values.

the p. and 1. balance total £84.710. But as

subsidiary, “investments” consisted chiefly of
the holding of the ordinary shares in the
pup co. At, March 28 the item was £lOO.OOO
les ® : « distribution of 6s. Sd. per share was
made within the period. As already men-
tioned, the liquidation is almost completed,
but the death-knock may be delayed by the
decision to hold on to the building for u
while The premises were in the last bal-
anee-sheet of Sun Newspaper (Melbourne),
I Ad., at £152,014, a fairly liberal valuation.
Another 18 months will pass before the Syd-
ney co. can erect, fit and occupy its new
premises, and there is the matter of the
claim with the City Council to keep share-
holders guessing. The outlook is unflecked
otherwise: the improved paper turned out
by the Evening News has not kept the Sun
from pressing forward to new records in cir-
culation and revenue, and shareholders may
look forward with confidence to the usual
divs. in the current year. Some of them
will be disappointed if they don’t soon get

“Owing to over-production,” the directors
say, “the price of sugar was reduced by £6
l_s. per ton.” Last year an agreement was
made between the 'Commonwealth and
Queensland Governments with a view to
stabilising the. market. The embargo on
foreign sugar imports was extended to Sep-
tember 1, 1928, and the price payable in
the Australian market for Australian sugar
was fixed at £27 per ton, with some conces-
sions to certain users. Also £1 was to be
deducted for the purposes of the Sugar
Board, mainly to cover losses on export of
the surplus. The growth of production lias, how-
ever, been so extraordinarily rapid, and the
surplus for export lias grown so quickly,
that the average return to the grower lias
fallen with such disturbing swiftness that
lately several mills have closed. Last sea-
son s production was, according to the man-
aging director of the C.S.R., just about
000,000 tons, of which over 210,000 tons had
to be exported ; the total Australian produc-
tion in 1920 was only 183,000 tons, and in
1023 286,000 tons. Exactly what the direc-
tors of this co. mean when they say that
“the price was reduced by £6 12s. per ton”
is not clear; but as granulated sugar is
quoted in London at very little above the
hxed price in Australia, it is obvious that
the average realised below that figure has
been very considerable. Other factors infiu-
enced the directors of Gibson and Howes in
reducing the div. Although the last crop at
Bingera, the co.’s big plantation, was well
above the average, this, season the rain lias
been much below the mean, and there will
be some light crops in the district. Added
to that, there have been further wage in-
creases ; and there is uncertainty also as
to the price to be paid for the coming crop.
Still, even at 8 p.c.. the return is pretty
good on recent share-prices, which have
varied between 225. and 255. 3d., the latter
prior to the last capitalisation. Owing to
the in-and-out nature of the sugar industry
due partly to climatic conditions and lia-
bility to labor troubles, the scrip of the
smaller cos. is not very popular. Fairy-
mead may be considered an S p.c. proposi-
tion, and it is only in the past three years
that the well-managed Miilaquin Co. - has
gone beyond that.

by cash and book debts. More or less liquid
assets totalled £96,858. Bingera plantation,
of 8000 acres freehold. witli buildings, mill
plant, etc., was in at £241,588. As the
factory and equipment alone were valued at
£223,000 by the Government Valuer in 1922
and there have been considerable mill and
plant additions since, the balance-sheet
entry does not over-state things.

In view of the possibility of a short sea-

over m good seasons should be stored in the
Commonwealth is worth consideration. With
tiie present policy of restriction of growing,

talk about a future timber famine the prin-
cipal flotation at the moment, so far as the
Shivery Isles are concerned, is tb e Tongariro
Railway Co., capitalised at £425,000, which
proposes to build a light railway 40 miles
long from the North Island main trunk line
to a place on Lake Taupo called—on very
hi» maps—Tokaanu. The object is to de-
nude about 60,000 acres of bush of the stand-
ing timber. Capital is split into £200,000
each of ordinary and preference shares and
£25 000 of deferred shares. Half the ordi-
nary issue is to go to the owner of timber
rights the Tongariro Timber Co., which also
is to ’ unload upon the new co. liabilities
amounting to about £lBO,OOO. A loan under
the British Trade Facilities Act is one of
the lures. The new co. is not to exploit the
timber itself, but proposes to
ting rights to other people. All the capital
is to be raised in London. »

“Kerogep” :
Every weary oil-seeker in the Commonvv ealtn
welcome the promised evidences of conditions estuarine
and deltaic and the salinity of the rocks of the
Walloons which will be made available in Ur,

modify the general opinion that our Trias-Jura lock

on the subject as well as rock salinity.

Queensland Antimony has not loafed on the
job: Jensen reports from the field that the
Black Bess shaft has been sunk to 34ft. and

“Ame” sends a northern tin item.— —
Great Northern Tin, Herberton (N.Q,), is stlU
producing ore from the new shoot in the Old Gully
shaft workings. It is also bailing the eastern shaft
workings, with the idea that prospecting may find
some new ore bodies. The new prospecting shad
the Chapman, is down 50ft. This shaft was located
by the divining rod. “A great tin lode at a shallow
depth, say, 30 or 40 feet,” was the forecast _or
the diviner, and the co. showed its faith by sinking
on the spot. Although the shaft is now below that
depth, “the great lode” is still
iCarpathia (N.S.W.) is getting about 5}
tons concentrates a fortnight from treat
ment of 130 tons of ore. Scrip keeps about
6s. 6d. with an inclination to go higher, but
profit-takers stand in the way of any market
excitement. The co. pays a sixpenny this
week, and has enough m hand to make a
run of quarterly look feasible. #
Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) is again on
Mines Department aid. There are the usual
indications that the glories of the old Luck-
now are merely awaiting a rebirth, but ho d
ers have had no luck in turning all these
indications into cash. Consequently there is
no market when it is announced that samples
from the flat make of ore coming in atop oi
the rise on the joint have gone from ooz. to
7ioz. to the ton. # #
The drop in lead and spelter is reflected
.in the depression of the North B. H. div. to
4s for the June quarter. March saw 55.,
and December 65.; the other three quarterlies
for 1925 were 4s. The 4s. means £140,000
payable to the 700,000 20s shares which
are valued on ’Change at about fo 145.-—a
shade over seven years’ purchase.
Junction North (B.II.) _ treated 15,117
tons ore and 35,243 tons of dump material
for the six months ended March 31; the
profit was £12,542 compared with £25,591
at September and £19.264 at March, 19~0.
\ shilling div. took £10,616. New plant and
development account got £6OOO, and taxation
reserve £l5OO. The debit at p. and 1. was
lowered to £120,385. The co. owed £lB,Oll
to creditors; cash balances were entered at
£13.763, deposit at call £10,138, Common-
wealth bonds £15,000, book _debts £3415J,
stores £21,882, concentrates £13,614. Since
the earth tremors on February 27 opera-
tions have been confined to slime reduction
while the 1100 ft. level is being put in order.

Tingha Tin (N.S.W.) made £73 net last
year against £628 lost in 1924. The suction-
cutter dredge, which has not yet been coaxed
into best behavior, treated 120,700 yards
and won 54} tons tin oxide, averaging just
over lib. to the yard. Tin marketed yielded
£10.278, against which working costs were
£9519 and administrative charges £686.
Against creditors’ claims for £4982 the only
liquid entries are £1371 for stores, £416 in
cash and £225 to be collected from debtors.

Sutherland Lode, Kiandra (N.S.W.), has
issued a hopeless kind of circular to share-
holders. The document informs them that L.
F Harper, senior State Geological Surveyor,
has furnished such a report that “the direc-
tors cannot take the responsibility of advising
shareholders to provide the large sum men-
tioned as the minimum required to test the
nature and extent of the gold-bearing forma-
tion at depth.”
Briseis Tin (Tas.) reported no clean-up
for April. The water-supply,, which was
poor, has now improved, and sluicing is again
in progress. Another tin proposition in the
Speck—the Monarch—advises that the
machinery is at the mine and that the pro-
perty has ample water. Boring showed
payable ground about 22tt. in depth. The
co. proposes to open out \ lckary Creek.
Revelation Co. (W.A.), after several un-
successful attempts to back a winner, has
given up. Like a number. of other small,
hand-to-mouth cos. formed in Adelaide dm-
ing the Hampton boom, it was hurriedly
floated to acquire something allegedly good
which proved to be bad. It tried its fortune
elsewhere, but did not succeed.. Now it is
being prepared for a decent burial.
Fremantle Trading Co., alias Fremantle
Smelters, is on the rocks. Some time, ago
a Belgian firm outbid the co. for business
on the Northampton lead-field, and its
smelters had then to close down. Now the
co’s mines at Northampton have ceased
work for want of funds, and, to make mat-
ters worse, the bailiff has Giken possession.
Greenbushes (W.A.) has livened up a bit
—about half a dozen dredges have lately
started, and a little prospecting for lost or
never-found lodes is proceeding,
fl 000.000 has been won from the held, and
there is be a lot more lett.
Orinda Co. (W.A.) is spending the little
money it lias left m sending Alt McDonald
per motor-truck to prospect north of the
Ivoolyanobbing Range on the Filgarn gold-
field. McDonald is an experienced man, and
was one of the original owners of the Great
Victoria mine at Burbidge. The belt which
he proposes to look at on Orinda s behalf
is well worth a # #
Sons* of Gwalia (W.A.) lias turned down
the Government’s offer to lend it Ho. I
on a £-for-£ basis conditionally on additional
plant being installed and more ore being
mined and treated. In announcing the offe
a month ago Minister for Mines Troy sa (1
that the assistance promised the co. would
enable it to carry out a scheme of compre-
hensive deep-level development and open up
more ore reserves, but apparently the Gwalia
board thinks differently. „
Malim Nawar South (F.M.S.), the se eond
of the Alluvial Tin pups, is well behind its
scheduled time for earth-eating. The co. was
registered in August, and chan man
F. G. Pratten stated on 25/9/24 that a
dredge contract had been let at an attractive
price, that deliveries of material were due
to start in nine months, and dredging in 18.
That meant production about the end or
March this year, and the scrip was moved
up to a premium of 120 p.c. Official infor-
mation, however, has been sparse since the
prophecy, and the market sagged to dbs..
from which figure it was moved up a pomt.
\t the time of the float trustworthy Malcolm
Newman was sanguine that the property
(520 acres in Kinta, State ot I erak) was
good enough to keep a modern dredge going
for 25 years, his calculations running into
or. million yards of pound ground and 1,
million yds/ of 12m, staff.. He mentioned
that several holes stopped in tin at ioft. to
but there is 25ft. of overburden. Biffi
enltv in boring by hand to depths beyond
70ft. resulted in several of the holes being
abandoned in material yielding several
nonnds to the yard.” It seems a pity othei
methods were not adopted for bottoming in
such bonanza country. It was also stated
that “occasional holes show rock bottom,
th« arT shallower. and ol .lower
Most of these are included in a rock-bai
area running through the middle of tlie; pro
perty.” Submerged rock pinnacles if at- all
frequent, might prove stiff obstacles to
thorough exploitation of the richer depths in
between. Bucket dredges are clumsy con-
traptions at best. # *
Timor Petroleum’s field superintendent, L.
L. Wrathall, reports that No. 2 drilling plant
arrived at Dilly, and was being transhipped
to the concessions. It is intended to us
this plant in treating the Irabin and Bi ll >
areas Dr. Wade, who is technologist to
the co., reports that the surface evidences
are that the oil is being held under pressuie.
A detailed survey to determine structure and
drilling sites is in progress. The steel dei-
rick at Mete Hou is being erected for the
No. 1 plant, which wall drill the area from
which the bulk sample of 20 tons of crude
oil was obtained from shallow shafts last year.
Taranaki's East Coast No. 1 drill at Wam-
nu has started. Moturoa is dead, and the
(Gin. casing is being pulled up at Tarata.
If the field staff can repeat the fast woik
done at the other holes the new bore will
soon be punched to its objective—or wheie
the objective is expected to be. #
“Bitumen” considers that 1 ‘K™'
marks on the Moturoa (M.L.) petioleum
possibilities does not exhaust the subject
The theory that Moturoa oil represeuts the resuffs
of distillation from Mokau coal by the heat
■volcanic intrusions is unsatisfactory. Sufficient evi-
dence exists to show that the petroleum deposits
ure of greater age than the igneous intrusions. These
latter have forced to the surface many samples of
the sedimentary strata through which they passed,
including sandstone, shale and seashells of great age.
But no fragments of coal or anything representing
it is in evidence to warrant the assumption that it
obtains in the deeper series. There are over a dozen
oil seepages spread over a square mile at Moturoa.
Oil occurs in a lake one mile inland. Recently
several gallons were bailed from a 17-year-old bore
two miles away, and analysis proved it to be totally
different from that obtained in Moturoa —'Which indi-
cates more than one source in the district. Ten
miles east of New Plymouth, in the Waitara district,
are three well-known seepages; and there are others.
Inflammable gas exists in every river thereabout.
Considering the soft shale which covers a great
portion of the North Island, the absence of numerous
oil seeps may be encouraging rather than otherwise,
as the tendency of weak rocks to repair and seal
dislocations, and thus prevent the escape of oil, is a
well-known condition in a good oil field. The
failure of a few bores in countries rich in natural gas
is not a convincing test of their possibilities.

“Bill O’C.”: Surprising telegrams ? Here
are a couple in my .experience which at east
surprised the recipients. An Adelaide lady,
hearing that her husband was dl .ni Mel-
bourne. immediately wired to her informant.
“Engage a hearse at once. Of course she
wrote “nurse.” A schoolmaster tnend was
startled to get a cablegram tiom England,

“Two Seas”: It isn’t good policy to be
too inquisitive in a kitchen where a Chinese
cook presides. On a A.S.W. station lc
cently, the mistress was prompted to lift tlie
lid of a saucepan from which drifted an
appetising odor of soup. She prompt y
dropped it with a clatter, for, to her horror,
she saw a large rat floating on the top. Hei
indignation was countered by tlie explanation
of the Chow that to save time lie was stew-
ing his own fancy dish in the family soup.

War Pensions Appeal Board at Auckland

that he had four children—-"two my own,
one a step-child and the other not any rela-
tion.” It took some sorting out, but it was
done Tlis wife first married a widower with
one child. After marriage the husband died
and left her with the child. She then mar-
ried again and had one child to her second
husband. After his death she took another
ticket in the matrimonial lottery, and bore
two children to her third, the Digger afore-
said. His statement was, therefore, literally
true. „ „

“Burglar’s Laborer”: About a recent Cus-
toms Department action I feel inclined to
make the same remark as my friend Ruben-
stein when he saw a fire-engine rushing to
its objective: "There they go interfering
again !” The Department has seized some
revolvers, made in Germany, which would
have been mi invaluable aid in the burglary
and allied trades. These handy little im-
plements, some of them shaped like pen-
knives, don't kill; they merely discharge
stupefying gas in the face of the person at
whom "they are aimed, and hence relieyg the
operator’s mind from the fear of dancing at
the end of a rope which accompanies the
use of an ordinary revolver. They enable
the up-to-date tradesman to emulate the
dentist and make painless extractions, so to
speak. But not only did the Customs De-
partment seize a consignment of these
humane weapons, hut, even after a couple
of the revolvers .had been passed as passen-
ger’s luggage, it followed them up and pounced
on them. I am still hoping that my friends
of the Freetrade League (which, I believe,
is Mr. Iluie) will make a fuss about it.

“Sierra”: “.T.D.C,” (B. 13/5/'26) wants
to know why a ship moors with two anchors
at one end instead of one anchor at each end.
It is done to allow her to swing freely
end-on to current or wind, and to do so in
her own length. Were she moored head and
stern, broadside-on to a strong current, either
the ship’s hull or the cables would soon
part. In the days of sail many ships avoided
a foul hawse by having both chains fast to a
swivel under the. bows. In the majority or
vessels clearing hawse was the sailors
usual Sunday task; and they didn't use
tugs, either.

“Jimmy Possum”: There is one woman
in Queensland, too, who believes there is
something in dreams (B. 15/4/26). She
dreamed that her husband, who was scrub-
felling, was killed by a tree. The vision was
so vivid that she tried to prevent him from
going to work next morning. To humor her
he agreed, but later in the day thought
worse of his pro-
mise, and went out
to complete the
contract. T here
was only one to
cut down, a
troublesome giant
that had been left
till the last. He
finished the job,
hut his life was
crushed out of him
by the tree as it
crashed. When the
wife saw his mates
comi n g, “You
needn’t tell me,"
she said. “I know
lie is dead."

“iClos V.": The
scepticism displayed
by “M.O.S” with
regard to the trans-

passage from Anat-
ole France. I n

replied to this that
it was lucky that
Mfere Noziere had
confined herself to
so modest a wish,
for had she gone so
far as to desire tine feathers, jewels, a cash-
mere shawl, a four-horse carriage a town
mansion and one in the country with a pai.t
besides I would not have had enough skin
on all my puny little body to carry the im-

excitement. A priest from the L)rysdale sta-
tion lately left for Wyndliam in a lugger,
manned by a mission-nigger crew. Running
into bad weather a few days after leaving
the mission, the boat was anchored m the
hope that conditions would moderate, in-
stead of moderating they became worse, the
anchor-chain parted, and the lugger w<io
totally wrecked. All aboard landed satelj,
after being much knocked about; but a cargo
of £5OO worth of tortoise-shell and a ton ot
rice was lost. After patching themselves up,
the Father and crew set out for the horrest
River Mission station, living blacktellow-
fashion —mainly on wild fruits. Two-days
walk brought them into contact with a large
party of wild natives, who. fortunately,
turned out friendly and guided them to the
Forrest River, which was reached three days

“Macess” : In its cabled account of recent
strike happenings in Britain the Argus re-
corded that “there were disorderly scenes m
the Old Kent-road district; several people
were injured.” Which, after all, only goes
to show'how tremendously conservative these
Britishers are :
Xew-fangled shows may fill the bill
With rag and syncopated ode;
Let those go jazzing, lad, who will,
An old-time lay is more our mode;
And so —with variations —still
“We knock ’em in the Old Kent-road.”

“Sixenate”: A cheerful petitioner in the
N S.W. Divorce Court admitted that this
was the fourth husband she bad found un-
satisfactory, and added that slie still re-
tained hopes of securing a suitable mate.
Yet she isn't the N.S.W. record; another
petitioner had been led to the altar seven
times, and had herself led the way into the
Divorce Court thrice. The other four hus-
bands had died, each after only a bnef ex
perience of matrimony; she mentioiied emu
nllv that she had had no fault to nnd witn
these, which evoked from s’Honah. ®® m ®'

HOW TIME FLIES!
“Say, Billy, do you really think I'll pass for seventeen in this
get-up?”
“Easily— get in a closed car and tell the man to drive like the
Devil.”
Apparently, husbands are amongst the com-
modities described as perishable. *
“Astern” : The telegram that most puzzled
me ran as follows : .
Hoo -if rightfully-bally - ray. One step nearer matri-
mony. .
\ subsequent message solved the mystery.
It was a young man's way ot apprising his
lady-love that he had landed a job he was
after. * * *
“Five Corners” : Great improvements have
latelv been made at Rose Bay, Sydney. In
mv childhood, 70 years ago. when wedrove
to Watson’s Bay to see Billings menagem
of lions, tigers, etc., \ye used sometimes 10
take the New South Ilead-road, so that we
could visit the old aboriginal, Rickety Dick,
who lived in a cask near Daniel ( ooper s
o-ate. Mr. Cooper, as he then was, built
Dick a shed, but he would not live m it
preferring his cask, a big one, of the sort
shipments of crockery used to be packed in.
If we did not throw' our money close to him.
thus saving him the trouble of crawling out
of his cask, he became greatly enraged, and
threepenny-bits were not easy to throw' pro-
perly. The “tliripennies” of those days were
very like the coins now in use, but w'ere not
minted, being “tokens” made by Hogarth and
Ericson, jewellers, in George-street, Sydney.
Pennies, or “coppers” as they were called,
were then issued by the Pyrmont Penny
Bridge Co. and several of the principal
°rocers in the city. How about a tablet by
the Historical Society for old Rickety Dick?

“Second Gear” : As the limit of convenient
or providential coincidence I submit the cir-
cumstances of an accident in Frenchman’s-
road, Randwiek, when a car banged into a
pole and the driver was badly hurt. It was
night, and there were only two other vehicles
and one pedestrian in sight when the acci -
dent occurred. The xiedestriau w r as the doctor
of the man who was injured; one of the
vehicles was the Coogee ambulance return-
ing from taking a case to hospital, and the
other was driven by the garage proprietor
with whom the injured man housed his car.

THE WINTER GARMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now lives are huddled, lone and sere
As lingering leaves as yet unpinned
From cloaks of trees, that trembling veer
Hunched russet shoulders to the wind;
And frozen to a frigid sneer
Are features that but lately grinned.
And home at last is clover
To pigs once wont to. stray,
And roving days are over,
Since Winter’s under way.
No grass-land, early whiting
With frost, may make us stay;
No woodland god, inviting,
On icy pipes can play;
While coals are redly glowing
And beaches, whipped with spray,
No more have privy knowing
Of what the lovers say.
And life is packed in virtue,
Like cotton-wool away ;
And blue eves may not hurt you,
Nor brown nor green nor grey.
Till only dreams are giving,
For warmth, to frozen clay
Some of the mad, hot living
That made a summer day.
Now chilblained ears do burn to hear
The shivering whimper of the wind,
And timid folk recall in fear
Just how and where and why they sinned,
When summer breathed of belles and beer,
Or e’er their blood was chilled and thinned.
VICTORIA.

SPREADING THE BIG-BROTHER MOVEMENT.
"The attempt by N.S.W. to bring Victoria under the 44-hour week is not proving a howling success.”
BIG BROTHER LANG. My little brother is such a taking little chap, so I thought you might like to adopt him."
VIC.: “No, thanks—l couldn’t think of depriving you of the pleasure it’s all yours.”

“Ruarie” : A three-masted schooner which
left Port Phillip last month must have been
launched on a Friday. After the mate had
signed on it was discovered that the vessel was
seven tons in excess of the tonnage to which
his ticket limited him; so a special permit
had to be obtained before the ship could leave
the Yarra. Then the engine-room (auxiliary
motor engines) caught fire and the two occu-
pants rushed for the exit, arrived there
simultaneously and stuck ! The mate hurried
to the cabin for a fire-extinguisher, and tail-
ing down the steps broke several ribs. Things
were straightened out at Williamstown, a
seaman promoted to be mate and a search
made for another A.B. A man was collected
who, after sleeping off a jag, had been
sobered up with cold water. But the skip-
per’s luck was still out; when the new re-
cruit regained the gift of speech he men-
tioned morosely that he was a fireman, not
a seaman. Another mariner was dug up and
the ship put to sea —to spend a week
stranded on a sandbank in Macquarie Har-
bor before she arrived at the port of Strahan.

“FY7” : The teamsters who replaced stolen
rum or beer with water (B. G/5/’26) would
have been regarded as pitiful dilettanti by
the men who “carried” to Barcoo stations
from the railhead at Roma or Emerald in
the roaring ’seventies. No publican thought
of taking delivery without sampling, and
WHAT THE SEX HAS TO SUFFER.
“Oh, I am reading the loveliest book, only it has such a
sad ending.”
“How's that?"
“You see, lie dies, and she has to go had: to her husband .”
one ingenious counter to this spirit of dis-
trust is still remembered. The teamster
drew off what rum he required through the
spigot hole. Into- this was then slipped
an empty sheep or bullock bladder, and when
this had been filled with water by a funnel
it was tied and dropped into the rum. Thus
the casks tallied correct weight, and yielded
a flow of fine, full-bodied rum when “spiled"
experimentally. The cask was usually given
a rest after its long journey, and the trick
worked a surnrisingly long time.
FASHION SAVED HIM.
“Is that a lion, Auntie? Well, he wouldn’t look much without his fur stole, would he?”
“Riwaka” : Truly the half of us don’t
know how the other half live. Thus a man
who turned up in the police-court at Haw-
Hawtliorn (Melb.) recently admitted that
he allowed 14 tiger and 4 diamond-snakes to
crawl about the rooms of his house. A jocu-
lar J.P. suggested that the addition ot a
boa constrictor would have made the place
rather a crush; whereupon the snake fancier
remarked that lie had kept one for a while,
and avoided overcrowding by giving it the
run of the yard. If we could only find out
I daresay there is somebody in Toorak who
keeps a couple of alligators in the bathroom.

“1 iuaurats” : Touching methods of dodging
the censor (B. fj/5/'26). My husband
throughout his active service kept me posted
as to his whereabouts by inserting redundant
letters into the words he wrote — e.g., “Wo
arc not hhlloawed to say mmuch soe I can-
not tell! you where we are.” While mark-
ing him an illiterate man in the eyes of cen-
sordom, this conveyed to me that he was
with his company at Hamel. In his case
the code was never interfered with and never
failed to carry its message.
# * * *
“Clerk” : A dour-looking man is Vic. Rail-
way Commissioner Clapp, but a story will
illustrate that he is not as
hard as he looks. The de-
partmental rat-catcher,
Paddy Moran, was hauled
into the Commissioner's pri-
vate sanctum one morning,
just after the rodent-exter-
minator had suffered a reduc-
tion of sixpence a day in his
“dirt” allowance. “Mister
Moran,” said Clapp with his
nasal drawl and usual inflec-
tion on the “Mister,” “can
you tell me how it is that
rats have been gnawing at
the door of this very office
lately?” Paddy refused to
be awed by the slogan-king’s
magisterial attitude. “I can.
Mr. Clapp,” he replied
solemnly. “The animals
have been trying to get in
as a deputation to ask that
my sixpence-a-day allowance
be restored.” Clapp's fea-
tures folded into a smile, and
the audacious Moran escaped
the reprimand that was com-
ing his way.
“T. 0.1.”: The site of the Sydney Mint,
which the Anglicans would like to get for
their new cathedral, was originally a grant
to John Macarthur: but when the pioneer
was in Europe for the Bligh trial. Mrs. Mac-
quarie induced Mrs. Macarthur to exchange
the block for another grant out Miller's Point
way, as the Governor's lady wanted the
Macquarie-street site for a hospital. That
particular portion of the hospital was origi-
nally used for staff quarters.
“C.Q.”: A piece of surgical derring-do
occurred on the Port Bowen when 2000 miles
off the M.L. coast recently. One of the crew
was smitten with appendicitis, rendering an
immediate operation necessary. The saw-
bones was a medical student who had never
cut a man open before, and the ship's
equipment, as is too often the case, was about
as up to date as a Catherine River witch-
doctor's. The engineers set to work and
fashioned tools, the chief steward applied
the anaesthetic anil the student did the job.
The victim is at present- telling the tale with
gusto in Melbourne.
* * * *
“Nisi Prius”: The flapper’s trick of leg-
pulling over the ’phone sometimes leads to
unforeseen consequences. Wiggins, a young
business man of unblemished reputation, was
in the. habit of enjoying a frequent tete-a-tete
over the wire with his affinity. The latter
one evening thought she was playing a good
joke on the ardent swain by informing him
in a disguised voice of primness that he was
on the wrong number. It didn't take A ig-
gins long to discover that he had been had,
but he determined that it shouldn't happen
twice, and the next time a voice of maidenly
asperity assured him that Exchange had
blundered he continued : “It doesn’t matter,
darling; you’ll do.” The instrument abruptly
froze off, and next morning Wiggins was in
receipt of a hostile letter from the strange
lady’s solicitor, and was hard put to it
to establish the purity of las intentions. Wig
gins has decided to abandon long-distance
endearments.
* * * *
“Adam’s Apple”: There are some quaint
“homes” in and around Sydney. Besides the
Domain dosser, who anyway is mostly a
casual, there are occupants of capacious re-
cesses in the cliffs fringing the sea-frontages
who can be regarded as permanent tenants.
In a cave near Bondi a family has long
been installed with quite a number of mod-
ern conveniences. The old hulks anchored
in the bays around the harbor provide marine
domiciles for more families than you’d think,
and disused band-kiosks, surf-sheds, worn-
out tramcars and castaway omnibuses have
all been pressed into service by members
of the Wliy-pay-rent? brigade. But the
most curious shelter I ever struck had been
originally occupied by a string of pedigree
greyhounds which won their owner a pot
of money at coursing. He had built them
elaborate quarters, and after giving up the
game and disposing of his pets lie rented the
kennels to an invalid pensioner and his Avifo
and family. Now, Avith papered Avails, lino,
on the . floors and chintz curtains . over the
AvindoAV, it looks as comfortable as many
a modern “semi-detached.”

“Another Spare Corp.” : Re iron trees as
observation-posts (B. 22/4/’26), it is news
to me that they Avcrc a German invention.
I knew of three in the sector between Armen-
ti&res and Messines that exactly corres-
pond with “Spare Corp.’s” description, even
to the ivy; but all were in our own lines.
This was early in 1017, when the position
of the line had not changed for about two
years, so there is not much likelihood that
they had been captured from Fritz. I came
across another clever o.p. immediately m
front of “Plug-street” Wood (near Mes-
sines). It was a derelict cottage that had
been literally razed to the ground, except
that one corner remained with a spike ot
tottering masonry pointing towards Heaven.
That’s all it appeared to be. anyway, until
you got there and found that the tottering
bricks had been very thoroughly reinforced
inside and a very strong, cosy o.p. made out
of them.
* * * *
“Trews” : The most unpopular man in the
Waikato (MX.) dairying district to-day is
a cocky who blew the gaff on his mates. Fp
till recently the dairy companies always re-
turned to the consignor a can of cream which
contained a rat, mouse or any other foreign
body, and charged him full freight both ways.
It often happened that the cream was not
really bad, wherefore Strawberry’s thrifty
owner would merely remove the superfluous
object and return the can to the factory
with the next cream consignment. Rut some
loose-tongued person let the rat out of the
can, as it were, and now the companies are
taking no chances. The grader still sends
back the can as before, but he has been in-
structed to first chuck in a good handful of
red or blue raddle and give the mixture a
stir up. There’s no chance of giving that
cream another fly.
« * * *
“Flagwagger” : Diggers weren’t allowed to
brawl in the lines, but from Broadmeadows
onwards I have seen men who had quar-
relled settling the argument with gloved
hands in a ring controlled by a referee.
By this means honor was always satisfied,
and it was seldom that any animosity re-
mained after victor and vanquished had
shaken hands. I know of only one scrap
which had a fatal termination. Early in
1916 the 23rd Battalion was encamped on
Sinai Desert. 10 miles from the Canal. Two
members of A Company had an argument
and decided to meet in the ring which had
been erected for the recreation of those
awaiting Abdul. .Tim, the smaller, was being
badly punished. He was game, and, spurred
on by the sympathetic onlookers, refused to
throw in the towel. During the eighth round
he suddenly dropped, unconscious, dying a
few hours later from heart-strain. His
opponent was court-martialled and acquitted
of any offence, but he was a good bloke,
and remorse punished him more severely
than any military penalty could have done.

“Olla Podrida” : A new way of serving a
summons was disclosed at a Huon (Tas.)
police court the other day. The defendant
had failed to put in an appearance, and
prior to hearing the case ex parte the magis-
trate remarked: “I suppose the summons
was served in the usual way?” “Not ex-

was personal service all right.” Then he
plunged into details. He had informed the
defendant that he had a summons for him,
and had thereupon been requested to read it.
because his quarry couldn’t read. The
trooper having complied, the defendant re-
marked: “It’s no good to me; I won’t lone
it.” and fled incontinently up his orchard.
The constable gave chase, and, overtaking
the fugitive, “I grabbed him, y’ Worship,
and pushed the paper down inside the neck
of his shirt.” The Court expressed itself
satisfied that the law had been complied
with.

the routes of proposed lines, he became well
known, and applied some of the pressure
that pushed the railway towards Mildura.
At different times he was mayor or presi-
dent of four municipal councils, chairman
of the Harbor Trust and member of the
Board of Works, and took a hand in, lots of
other things. He was BS, and had been a
good Australian for G 2 years. Reporters
liked him because in times of crisis and of
momentous decisions he would give them a
nod, and didn’t expect to be puffed as a
reward.
hf-”: I knew .Jack Walsh, the detective-
inspector murdered with a colleague near
Kalgoorlie, for over a quarter of a century.
A Limerick man, he arrived in Australia in
ms twenties and spent a few years in Queens-
land before ho joined the W.A. police force
m the early ’nineties. Thereafter he was
mostly on the goldfields. He was a conscien-
tious and efficient officer, and a man who
never neglected an opportunity for kindli-
ness. His work brought him into close
relations with all sorts of people, but I
think the distinction he most valued was one
conferred quite unofficially by the class from
whom one would hardly have looked for
testimonials—that “Jack Walsh always gave
a man a _ fair deal.” No pressman who
watched him conducting court cases could
tail to note that his fairness was as marked
as ins keenness. It is surely one of death’s
ironies , that such , a man should have been
the victim of apparently as foul and cowardly
a murder as was ever perpetrated.
Dying at 77, Joseph Gill, shipping agent,
wool broker, squatter and bachelor, of Mel-
bourne and Goulburn (N.S.W.), left per-
l- 0 .™ I ,A^ ope^y in Victoria worth just on
£260,000. The bulk of it is to go to the
Salv army in Melbourne, Sydney and Goul-
bm n. Nieces and friends were well remem-
bered, and generous tips were ordered to be
given to three attendants who had been civil
to him at his clubs in Melbourne and Sydney,
Lavington Bonython, of Adelaide Adver-
tiser, has gone back into the City Council
It was he who set the fashion, nearly 00
years back, for regarding municipal work as
a career for quite young men with fathers
better known than themselves; others fol-
lowed the idea, and the council took on a
new slim and youthful aspect. He has now
taken the vacancy in a North Adelaide ward
caused by the death of Graham Wald.

What is a Fair Thing?
To the Public this is the Paramount Question
. ' - S'
The Present Disastrous Strike of Engine-drivers
and Firemen Requires Explanation.
WHAT DOES THE
PUBLIC SAY?
Are the wheels of industry
to stop because engine-drivers
and firemen who agreed to
accept the Tribunal’s finding
now refuse to accept the in-
creases granted, although they
have been accepted by the
Queensland branch of their
own union?
Mr. Justice Higgins, in 1913,
awarded minimum-wage men 9/-
and winding drivers 12/- a day.
The Special Tribunal’s rates,
which apply to-day, are: —
Minimum-wage men, 18/- per day.
Winding engine-drivers, main
shaft, 23/- a day.
Winding engine-drivers, other
shafts, 21/- a day.
With an addition of 7\ per cent.
for the afternoon and night
shifts.
Again, Mr. Justice Higgins, in
1913, fixed hours at 8 per day, or
a 48-hour working week, exclusive
of meal hours. The Special Tri-
bunal laid them down as 46 per
week inclusive of meal hours, or a
reduction of five hours weekly. In
effect it granted a 43-hour working
week.
The Special Tribunal also
granted 4 additional Holidays.
A SIMPLE PROPOSITION.
A wants more wages. B con-
siders he is paying sufficient. A
and B agree that C hear evidence
and determine what A s rate of
wages should be. C hears the evi-
dence and pronounces judgment.
B, although still contending that
he is paying a fair thing, accepts it,
and A, although he agreed with B
to accept the judgment, rejects it.
THAT IS THE POSITION
PRECISELY IN CONNECTION
WITH THE STRIKE.
Listen to Argument, but
Remember the Points!
POINT 1.
There has been no decrease in
wages; on the contrary, in-
creases were granted to every
engine-driver and fireman in
New South Wales, Queens-
land, Victoria and Tasmania,
without exception.
POINT 2.
The Chairman of the Engine-
drivers and Firemen’s (Coal
Industry) Special Tribunal
was appointed by agreement.
See Commonwealth Gazette
No. 77 of September 27, 1920.
Thus A (the employed engine-
driver or fireman) agreed with
B (the employing colliery pro-
prietor) as to who the Chair-
man should be.
POINT 3.
The increases were applied
throughout, and have been
accepted and are being
worked under by the Queens-
land branch of the striking
union.
WHAT DO THE COAL-
MINERS SAY?
Are officials of the Engine-
drivers and Firemen’s Associ-
ation to be dictators as to when
the whistle shall blow and the
pay envelopes be available?
The following comparison or
wages paid under present Federal
Arbitration Awards for Metal*
liferous Mines and outside indus-
tries with those fixed by the
Special Tribunal are given for the
benefit of the public:—
WINDING DRIVERS
(raising human beings).
At collieries: 23/- per day (Main
shaft, day shift).
Ditto: 21/- (Other shafts).
At metalliferous mines and in out-
side industries:—
1 8/6 per day; and 17/6 (where
raising material only).
FIREMEN,
At collieries: 18/9 (One or more
boilers)
At metalliferous mines and at out
side industries:—
1 boiler 14/10
2 boilers 15/1
3or more ditto ..... 15/4
LOCOMOTIVE FIREMEN.
At collieries: 18/7 per day.
At metalliferous mines and at out-
side industries:—
15/4 per day.
Now, is the Engine-drivers and
Firemen’s Strike a Fair Thing?

“Werrimee”: On a long, dry stretch of
western road the only water for teamsters was in one
of squatter Skinflint’s paddocks. As he permitted only
teamsters who brought loading for him to water
there, the confraternity generally contrived to spread
the goods over three or four- teams. But orders
weren’t frequent enough to provide even these with
passports for every trip. When teamsters were
camped in the vicinity, a man was put on guard at
tlie waterhole, which was about 300 yards long.
The only man who got past that sentry was Dick
the Dodger. Late at night he rode slowly towards
one end of the hole with a bullock-bell on his horse,
and while the watchman hurried after him, think-
ing he was one of the carrier’s bullocks, Dick’s
mate quietly watered the cattle at the other end.

“Clerk": Does every Australian abo. feel
more dignified when accompanied by a tyke? When-
ever Railway Commissioner Clapp goes up Lake
Boga way (Vic.) he expects a visit from a colored
ancient of the district. The old chap failed to come
on one occasion, and next time the Commissioner's
special was at the station the guard inquired the
reason. “Dog died,” Jacky explained, and then
added: “Man he look such a fool without a dog.”
* * # #
“King Kurrajong": Hares soon leave a
district when it becomes infested with rabbits, so
“Pick” declares. Quite correct. The antipathy that
long-ears has for his poor relation is founded On
a very definite cause—the murderous proclivities of
buck-rabbits. As every rabbiter knows, the doe
seldom breeds in a warren, but goes apart into a
short burrow with a single entrance, where her
brood is safe from the bucks, who cheerfully wipe
out any kittens they happen to come across. The
leverets, on the other hand, are housed in an open
nest in a log or under a bush, and so fall easy
victims to the rabbits. This, combined with the
fact that dogs, traps and poison follow the rabbit
wherever he goes, much to the hare’s distas'te,
accounts for the latter's disappearance when cotton-
tail butts in.
* * * *
“Atherton”: The silence made a bush
mother I know cease work and listen. Childish
laughter set her running down the hill. At the scrub -
edge she stood aghast. Her two toddlers had dis-
coverecl a playmate. Tts new skin blazed gold and
brown upon the blady
sfiiiss. Both toddlers’
chubby hands grasped
the heavy tail and
pulled it. One baby’s
fingers slipped on the
.'(•ales, and she tumbled
head-first upon the
coils. The mother's
heart leapt to her
throat. The 13ft.
python lifted his head
and stared at the
children. Without hiss-
ing, his tongue shot
out and caressed his
blunt nose. Well fed
and sleepy in the warm
sunlight, he showed no
anger. The mother
thought only of the
coils which might
crush both children
with ease. They lifted
the tail again, down
towards the end, where
their fingers could
nearly grip. They
pulled 3ft. of it out of
the coils. Seemingly
without the slightest
effort, the tail drew
back within the coils,
and the curly heads
bumped together as
the youngsters landed
on tlie snake. The
mother commenced
singing. The young-
sters redoubled their
efforts to show off their
playmate. The snake’s
tongue shot out a little
faster. The mother as
she sang walked slowly
forward and, still sing-
ing, bent oveir the
children and gently
loosened their fingers.
With a youngster under
each arm, and without
ceasing her song, she
walked up the hill. The snake, motionless, watched
her until the voice broke; then it uncoiled and
made for the scrub.
‘‘Larrapinta” : My non wanted to make a
pair of ski to use at Mt. Buffalo (Vie.), but found
that enough imported ash or hickory for the job
would cost about £l. Just then I was able to
buy for ss. at the auction of a coachbuilder’s stock
a piece of timber that looked as if it might do.
It was labelled “N.S.W. Handlewood,” and was
very similar to hickory, only darker in color. And
splendid stuff it proved, easy to work, close-grained,
and as flexible as whalebone. The ski were so good
that I w’ould like the material for another pair,
but none of the timber merchants seems to have even
heard of the wood. Can anyone identify it, and
state what district it grows in, or, failing that,
inform me what timber the ski makers of Kiandra
use?
“Wingella": I have eateu brolga—“anyan-
panyan” as the natives call it —and, despite “May-
lie’s” statement, found it delicious. I cut the
breasts off the birds, sprinkled them with pepper
and salt, added a tablespoonful of salad oil, and let
them lie in it overnight. Grilled or fried, they were
fully equal, if not superior, to the finest rump steak.
Also, they made delicious “beef olives.” Jabira is
ALL THE CONVENIENCES.
M.C. : “If any of th’ ladies don't like dancin’ in their ’ats, they'll he out of th’ way

just as good. Parrots and cockatoos make splendid
soup, but are rather tasteless if fried. All pigeons
are excellent, and nothing can beat a young goanna
stuffed and roasted in a camp-oven, with potatoes,
onions and plenty of thick brown grav.v. Alligator
is similar in taste, smell and appearance to pork,
and snake is nearly as good as goanna. Bandicoot
is first-rate if young. Ducks and quail are splendid;
so also are young geese, though the old birds are
tough. Jungle-fowl, too, are tough, and rather
doubtful-looking, the flesh being, purplish. Nearly
all bush-birds’ eggs are excellent for cooking, jungle-
fowls’ being quite as delicate as the ordinary hen’s,
though fully four times as large. Emu-egg custard
can’t be beaten, and peewees’ eggs make splendid
puddings. I may mention, though, that these foods
were eaten as a change from the tinned article.
Such things as fresh milk, butter, fruit, beef or
vegetables were unknown luxuries; our only chance
of a change in the menu was the obtaining of native
foods. For three years I never tasted butcher's meat.
* * * *
“Really’-; The greatest skite in our dis-
trict has been almost cured. He was continually
boring the townsfolk by declaring how immeasurably
superior everything he had, or every product he
grew, was to anything else of its kind. He had not
been down the street for two or three days, and
consequently was mystified at seeing everyone chuckle
when they looked his way. Finally he asked a friend
what the joke was. The latter told him to go
down to the shire hall and look at the notice-board.
He did so, and there read the following: “My
cow is the best in the world; it gives a hogshead of
milk 10 times a day. My horse makes Valicare look
like a cab-moke. My sow had a litter of 50 full-
grown pigs. My fowls lay eggs daily, nightly and
twice on Sundays and holidays”!
» * *
“Johnar”: Despite “Buttenderry” (B.
10/4/’26), it is quite common for wild bullocks
when being mustered to bury their heads in bushes
and squat like rabbits. When we were lifting a
mob from No. 8 paddock, Soudan, Barcoo River,
about 50 head of prime Herefords galloped for about
100 yards towards a patch of turkey-bush about
4ft. high. On reaching it, every beast squatted. A
crack with the whip started them off again. A
somewhat similar experience came our way on the
Ord River (W.A.).
***#•
"Kriz” : Sharks seldom trouble the divers
working the pearl-shell beds on the nor’-Westralian
coast. Should a shark become too inquisitive, the
submerged man manipulates a valve on his helmet,
and the escaping air-bubbles scare away the enemy.
It is the diamond-fish he fears, and should one of
these monsters hover round the diver quickly comes
to the surface. Not because the fish will attack
him, but because of the risk of the clumsy creature
getting foul of the air-pipe. These prowlers are
not very often seen, but should one of them encounter
the pipe he will not back out, but will continue,
taking the pipe with him until the strain severs the
line. A little time back a Japanese diver, noticing
one of them about, signalled that he was coming up,
but before he had time to get going the fish fouled
the line. The diver, however, had presence of
mind to bend the hose over, , thus keeping air
in the dress. The lugger crew, when the strain came
off the pipe, realised that something serious had
happened, and quickly got another diver down, who
with difficulty brought his mate to the surface.
“Trojan”: An interesting point is raised
by “Frontignae” in his comment on needlewood
pipes (B. IS,/3/’26). Our dredge brought up a
choice assortment of ancient snags from under 16ft.
of Darling River mud, and, from an unpromising
needlewood stump included in the collection, our
river-boss turned out a prize lot of pipes. From its
appearance, one would say that the stump had been
anchored in the silt about the time of the ’ninety
flood. Our toilers—fairly heavy smokers —keep the
mosquitoes at bay with pipes as finely-grained as any
briar-root, and, so far, no symptoms of eye-trouble
have caused them to forsake the locally-made article.
* * *
“Keppel” : Caves similar to those near Mt
Sturgeon (B. 8/4/’26) are found in the Narrien Range
(Q.). They are mostly small, but contain some
native paintings and a vast variety of fossil speci-
mens. One of the most interesting finds was the
skeleton of a horse in a cave having only one
opening, Bft. high. The horse, it is surmised, en-
tered as a foal, and, being unable to escape, had
grown up in the confined space, on the
grass it could pick there—and not too much of it,
either.
SUCH A SILLY QUESTION.
" What's the feeling on prohibition here?”
“Fifty miles ter the nearest pub and six
months' drought—whatcher think it’s
likely to be?”
“Bloody Bill": The old European resi-
dents of the Samoan Islands swear by the native
cure for dysentery—green bananas burnt to a char-
coal. Having seen a number of native cures, and
having known those treated with white-man medicine
to die off like flies, I believe in it too. But to talk
of Samoan medicine to a doctor in Samoa is about
as useful as propounding the virtues of booze to a
prohibitionist.

THE SICK TEAMSTER.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m gazing down the dusty road
And o’er the wheat-brown plain,
Because that way went Hennessy
With freight of precious grain.
I know another watches, too,
Beyond their wee white gate—•
The blue-eyed wife of Hennessy,
Young Hennessy, my mate!
Though he was warned a hundred times
By kindly hearts that know,
Who else should drive the Devil’s team
Did Hennessy not go?
So, sick and sore and fever-parched,
He mounted to the seat
With dull eyes on the leader’s ears,
And soon the unshod feet
Moved off and out adown the slope,
Along the steep, rough road,
And much there is at stake with that
The Drought’s last precious load.
Across the flats where sun-motes dance
Above the long-dried mire,
Rutted by wheel and scored by hoof
Scooped out by motor-tyre,
Went forth that shadow of a man
Who could not keep his feet,
Yet sat behind the Devil’s team
Within the driver’s seat;
Behind the bay, with coal-black mane,
The restive, ill-starred brown—
A colt that flattens both small ears
A full mile out of town —-
A FRIGHTFUL AFFLICTION.
“I used to drink beer, too, my man, but I realised it didn’t agree
with me, so I gave it up.”
“Struth, mister! Ain’t there no cure?”
The chestnut with the silver mane,
Blue roan with rolling eyes,
And dapple-grey all scarred with wire;
Like hounds they go, full-cry ;
Leap underneath the whip, and strain
Their utmost strength to show—
That Hennessy has grasped the reins
The wily rascals know.
The while we’re waiting anxiously
With dazzled eyes and sore,
The woman by her shady blind,
I at my lone hut’s door.
I loved her long ere Hennessy
Rode up into her life;
But laughing ways and sparkling eyes
Are swift to woo a wife!
So, of the two who watch for him,
Adown the sun-scorched road,
I somehow think that, loving both,
Mine is the heavier load.

That Australia can, and is, producing enough
Linseed Oil to meet all her requirements.
That the Linseed Oil manufactured by MEGGITT
LIMITED, the pioneers of the Linseed-crushing Industry
in Australia, is, in every respect, as good as the best brand
of imported Oil.
That it is superior to most imported brands.
That it is cheaper than imported Oil.
That it is manufactured by Australian workmen in
plants at Parramatta, Melbourne and Adelaide, the
efficiency of which is equal to any in the world.
That thousands of Australian Pastoralists and
Farmers are to-day depending on Meggitt’s Linseed
Sheep Nuts for the maintenance of their flocks.
That the output of Linseed Sheep Nuts is governed by
the output of Linseed Oil.
That every eight-gallon case of Meggitt’s Linseed
Oil consumed in Australia makes available sufficient
Linseed Sheep Nuts to feed 1500 sheep for one day.
That every man who specifies “MEGGITT’S” when
ordering Linseed Oil is ensuring Oil equal to any produced
in the world, is saving good money, is
helping to build an industry indispens-
able to industrial and pastoral Australia
and is rendering valuable assistance to
primary producers by making available
a food which affords them a practicable
and economic means of saving their stock.

ECONOMICAL RABBIT DESTRUCTION
CYANOGAS
(Calcium Cyanide)
FUMO
BRAND
Cyanogas (Calcium Cyanide) is the only thoroughly satisfactory
fumigant for rabbit destruction. It is an especially suitable method
for treating burrows after ploughing.
If you are using too much dust, adjust your Fumo Dust Blower
to use less; this can be done easily and the Cyanogas will kill
just the same. Write to us for any information you require.
Mr. W. H. Hammond, of “Gawsworth,” Hare-
field, writes, Ist February, 1926: “I have
from time to time used your cyanide prepara-
tion in odd deep burrows that are too exten-
sive to dig out. If properly used the
results are always sure, and I do not think
that a rabbit ever escapes.”

“Pick”: When .Tack .Campbell, springing,
from the sliearing-floor at Bibbenluke station
(X.SAY.), had three inches of a shear-blade that
hung under the cap-rail of the pen driven into his
back, we carried him to the hut and started round-
ing up the horses to raise a doctor. Ah Sue, our
Chinese cook, condemned the waste of time and
money. “You gettem bear-gall; me curem,” he
said. We let go the horses, knocked a bear out of
a neighboring gum, and then went back to our
barbering. Jack was told nothing of the bear, bqt
explained afterwards that the Chinese medicine had
a taste of gum-leaves, and that the lotion was hell
on a shear-blade stab. But he. was back at work
in four days." > >

“White Australia”: Thursday Island has
a hard nut to crack. Some years ago an effort was
made to make a clearance of color at the State
school, and by arrangement, with the Aboriginal De-
partment the residents erected a special building
which the Protector undertook to run and fill.
Chinese and Japanese, however, continued to attend
at the same school as Europeans, but others of color
were sent to the abo. school. Now some of the
colored citizens are protesting that they are not
THE DIFFERENCE.
“Why dost always wear they ole cotton, singlets, boay?”
“Doan’ knaw—’ez a flannel better?”
“Coorse ’e ez. When a flannin’s cold and wet — w’y, ’e’s warm
and dry.”
abos., decline to be called by that name, and demand
that their offspring be allowed to attend the State
school. As these so-called abos. include children of
Malay, Manila, South Sea and other bloods, with the
usual admixtures to be found in northern Aus-
tralian ports, the heads have to admit that the
youngsters are certainly not abos. ; but they don’t
know what to do about it unless they set up still
another school.
“Wang” : Their conversation had been of
remarkable feats of marksmanship. Old Sam butted
in: “Yes, some of them things yer’ve been tellin’
of was pretty slick, I’ll admit, but they’re nothin’
t’ something I once did meself. It wus in tli’ days
before breech-loaders came in, when yer had t’ use
a ramrod t’ load yer gun with. One windy day me

«
an’ Bill Sanders wus out shootin’ rabbits, an’ Bill
puts his hand inter Iris pocket t’ pull out a coupler
wads. When he,pulled his hand out he accidently
yanked out a five-pound note he’d had in his pocket
with th’ wads. The high wind caught it up before
"lie could grab it, an’ it flew ’way up inter th’ air.
I was just rammin’ home a charge, so I let fly, an’
we saw it hit th’ ground about a quarter, of a mile
; ahead. When we got up ter it there was Bill’s five-
pound note stiekin’ on the end of it.” “Wot,
only one fiver ?” asked Harry. “Mighter made it two
for the time that yarn’s bin in circulation.”
* * * *
“Uramao”: A mine of information about
old M a o r i secrets
perished owing to the
scrupulous adherence
to a promise made to
a Maori tohunga, back
in the twilight of
Maorilalid’s • history, by
Judge Maning, . the
author of “Old New
Zealand.” This “Pak-
eha Maori,” who was
greatly respected by
the natives, one day
stumbled across a to-
hunga at his unhal-
lowed rites on tapu
territory in the bush,
an offence that could
only be atoned for by
death. Maning, recog-
nising his dangerous
position, pleaded that
the tohunga’s pain at
the intrusion could not
exceed his own, and
eventually the priest
told him that the only
thing he could do was
to initiate Maning,
swearing him to
secrecy. Long years
later, when the Judge
was dying in London,
he requested a friend
to burn a bundle of
manuscript containing
all the knowledge he
had been sworn not to
divulge. The friend
wished to postpone the
matter, but promised,
and on calling again'
found Maning was dead.
Himself as scrupulous
as the Judge, he con-
signed the priceless
MS. to the flames.
“W.M.” : For some time after landing in
Bananaland a lad newly-arrived from the old country
spent his days milking cows and feeding pigs
on various dairy-farms near the coast. Then, in
company with a friend, he made west and sought
work from a selector. He was offered suckering.
“Oh, yes,” he said, “I’ll have a go at it all right.
But what sort of work is it —anything to do with
pigs?”
“ Jesmond”: What is the record swim for
a horse without halter or leading-rope from a boat?
Some years ago a Drouin (Vic.) farmer sold a
stock-horse to a man on Phillip Island. A fortnight
later the nag swam the passage between Newhaven
and San Remo, but was caught as he came out of
the water. A few weeks subsequently he was seen
entering the sea at Rhyll, a small island township,
and some hours later the people at Bass, on the
mainland, saw him come ashore, have a roll, and
canter off towards Drouin. This meant a swim of
between eight and nine miles through shark-infested
water. The nag’s exploit is made more remarkable
because the tide was against him most of the
way,
* * * *
“Anaf”: It is quite likely that “Lier’s”
suggestion of tea as a cure for distemper in dogs
(B. 15/4/’26) is a useful one. Associated with the
disease in young dogs is diarrhoea, the two condi-
tions being in some way allied, and as one of the
astringent effects of tea is to check diarrhoea, pro-
ducing a mild form of constipation, it is probable
that the distemper may be remedied, through the
condition thus produced. At the same time, the
best remedy when the characteristic discharges from
the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth are
present is a mixture of boracic acid and creolin
dissolved in water and applied to the nose and mouth
frequently.
* * *
“Pick” : Out west (N.S.W.) this summer
the sheepmen’s curses have been directed against
“the devil’s claw” seedpod. Of a horn-like fibre, it
resembles the dried head of a dead curlew, with a
four-inch curved beak and extending sharp hooks
where the neck should be. Groping through the
grass, the sheep pushes his nose into the concave
of the pod and is instantaneously gripped by the
hooked points above and the curved beak around his
underjaw. Thus muzzled the poor fellow can neither
feed nor drink, and unless his predicament is noticed
by the occasional boundary-rider or dog-man he
starves to death. The pest is spreading apace on
the runs where the seasons are good.
* * * #
“Julian”: Three firewood cutters at Kur-
rawang (W.A.) found an outcrop that promised well;
so they threw down their axes, grabbed pick and
shovel, and started to make a mine of it. They
found this thirsty work, and transferred a fourth
interest in their show to the bumboat man who was
carting beer to the woodcutters’ camps. The con-
sideration for the transfer was a dozen of beer per
man per week until they had their first clean-up at
the Coolgardie State battery. It went Boz. to the
ton. Dear beer!

“Talapousie” : “M. 8., 1922,” declares (B.
6/ 5/’ 26) that dengue isn't really a serious matter.
I had it while in the islands about 17 years ago,
and I’ve neither seen nor experienced anything in
influenza to equal that fortnight of misery' and the
subsequent weariness of getting back to normal.
My eyelids swelled; and to open my eyes was
like trying to shift leaden weights; it was agony
to lie for five consecutive minutes in one position
for 'the soreness of my bones; the fever was so
fierce that the lightest covering was impossible, and
the first seven days of it were accompanied by dry
retching. The only solace was that things that had
irritated me to madness when the fever was coming
became marvels in delirium—for instance, a native
boy r learning to play a banjo and another a mouth-
organ resolved themselves into a heavenly orchestra
which seemed to soothe other phantasies conjured
up by the fever. After .14 days’ intermittent fever
I came back to consciousness and got the scare of
my life by viewing my limbs covered with tiny
specks—just as if they had been sprinkled with
cayenne pepper. The doctor said it was a blood-
sweat caused by the fever forcing itself through my
pores, and he reckoned I was lucky to have it that
it saved my life. The aftermath was a horrible
skin-rash, a lassitude that lasted for months, the
loss of a luxuriant growdh of hair (hair was a
crowning glory in those days) and an ansmic
condition that recurs even to-day if great care
is not exercised. During convalescence I was enter-
tained by lying on the wide hotel verandah watch-
ing the funerals of infants and fairly old people,
victims of the dengue epide- .ic. It settled a third
of the babies and nine-tenths of the old people in
the European community of Apia (Samoa) on that
occasion. It was the island’s introduction to the
disease, a gift from Fiji, which group had to thank
Queensland for the scourge.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: If Bunny wasn’t a first-
fleeter he wasn’t far behind. For at least three-
quarters of a century it was an offence to interfere
with a grazier’s rabbits. In August, 1858, a case
was tried at Parramatta in which plaintiff claimed
damages for the destruction of 50 rabbits by two
dogs belonging to defendant. His warren was situ-
ated near Ryde, and was enclosed partly by a high
fence and partly by a stone wall. The dogs had
got over the wall at night. A verdict was entered
for plaintiff, with £5O damages, being a pound for
each bunny destroyed.
*"* * *
“Carl the Commercial” : A tea traveller at
Downing (N.S.W.) recently stood talking to the
lady of the house on the front verandah. Her
husband, a waggoner, pulled up at the gate of
the front vegetable-garden—so yards away—and
started to come in. Suddenly he rushed back and
began dragging a tarpaulin over his vehicle and load.
For three minutes the traveller and the missus
watched tlie husband toil. Then he came ramping
up the drive wringing-wet in clothes and red-hot in
temper. The storm had swept along the road and
the country on one side of it. The verandah where
the traveller and lady stood wasn’t even sprinkled.
* * *
“M.A.6.”: When a resident of Noarlunga -
arrived in the Adelaide market with his first load
of early peas he was astonished to find three mud-
bespattered and despondent fowls on the. under-
carriage of the motor-lorry. They had made a habit
of roosting in this sheltered spot, and presumably
had no idea of its possibilities until after they
had completed the 20 miles to Adelaide over a
rough road. A few weeks later another early start
caught the birds napping, but the row they made
at the prospect of a second ride like the last enabled
the driver to lighten his load by three indignant and
expostulating chooks half a mile from home.
* * * *
“Atherton”: With plenty of energy anrl
Bs. in money my mate/ proceeded to put up a house
four years ago. It has needed no repairs since.
The job took him 10 days. The house was of two
rooms, 24 x 12 feet, with pug chimney. These w r ere
the materials: broad-leafed ti-tree posts and rafters;
river-oak wall plates; palm battens; blady-grass
roof; wire and nails. In the thatching he exposed
the grass roots instead of the blades, as the Malays
generally do. With the roots to the weather, the
thatch is apparently much stronger, has a longer
life and does not harbor vermin as badly.
A HINT, MOST .LIKELY.
“It’s gotter cork in it, ’Erb. Might he a
message from some ship in distress.”
“Might he, Bert. It’s empty.”
“K.J.M.” : In the ’eighties, while riding
through the bush with my brother in western Tic.,
we' were caught in a shower of frogs. The creatures
were about an inch in length, honey-colored, and
semi-transparent, the viscera and backbone being
easily discernible. They were lively little chaps,
and hopped about on us and the horses to our dis-
comfort and- the latter’s obvious fear. We gauged
the shower to have covered about an acre in extent.
Their life was ephemeral, as on our return we saw
countless numbers of them dead and almost dried
up by the sun.
TO YARRAWONGA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“With a request that the Yarrawonga Shire Council
should be exempt from the provisions of the Health
Act compelling municipalities to appoint a qualified
health inspector, a deputation waited on the Minister
of Health yesterday.”— Argus.
“Oh, strange the sight, as I’ll be saved,” said the
father of all fleas.
By rat and ’roach each road was paved—they came iv.
companies ;
The air above was black with flies, and thick with
lice the ground ;
Our hopping folk, as you’ll surmise, in regiments
were found ;
Bacilli by the billion came, bacteria of renown
Left homes where they had made their name despite
all hounding down.
And aye on river, road and track the marching-
song grew stronger ;
This was their hymn: “We’re going back again to
Yarrawonga !”
“Unseeing, ye will think I’ve raved,” said the father
of all fleas.
A million million typhoid germs waved whiskers in
the breeze ;
The hoary old, the tender young thought this too
good to miss,
From lowliest germ but newly sprung from parth’no-
genesis
To greyest B. diphtheriae, who yet could get about
If “carriers” would take ’em free. And how the
hosts did shout
As swift they moved to the attack, in numbers
ever stronger ;
“The health inspector’s got the sack,” they sang.
“In Yarrawonga
We’ll linger longer!'’

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Lady do Chair, in sandalwood marocains,
and Elaine, in bottle-green, dispensed hand-
shakes on Monday afternoon in the entrance
to Government llonse drawing-room. The
occasion was the State Exes.’ first music-
and-tea party of the season, and quite half
the musicians and one-third of the city's
artists were among those present. Sir Dud-
ley, embodying all the shining virtues of
the. British Navy, turned his devastating
smile on the taxi-crabbed as they arrived
out of the rain-bespattered afternoon, and
changed them into amiable citizens once more.
Entered Pavlova, attended by her husband
and the bearded Wurmser; came, too, the
slim Miss Stewart of the dancing company,
wearing a jade-green hat. Solid citizenship
was represented by the handsome trappings
of Hugh Denison’s lady; and from civic
ramparts came Town-clerk Layton, next to
Sir Dudley the best-dressed man in the room.
On the end of a deep upholstered seat, using
a lorgnette to distraction between the brim
of her honey hat and a straight and whitened
little nose, sat Renee Polly Kelly with
a Past. Slim young gentlemen of the Rus-
sian ballet looked intense at different points
of vantage; Mrs. Swinson discussed Rach-
maninoff with Mrs. Albert Littlejohn ; the
Belgian Consul brought his lady ; and Mrs.
Quick brought her amazing eyelashes. The
afternoon’s music-weavers were Boyce and
Mowat Carter and Alexander Sverjensky:
and Renee Maxwell, in a voice like distilled
primrose, sang of Phyllis with her charm-
ing graces.
The Musical Association's party to Pav-
lova which followed the vice-regal flutter
was held in the Exhibition Hall at Farmer’s
instead of in the dining-room; you could
almost feel the good housewives deploring
the use of the well-polished tables for a tea-
drinking. Pavlova, in a huff and black-
splashed creation, made a speech that was
mostly gesture on her part and guesswork
on the listeners'; and then, just as the ices
of the polite were turning into mush, the
lady was wafted out before the heavy male
entourage without which she never stirs
abroad.
At half-past four on Friday Pavlova
drifted in to the party the Feminists had
gathered in her honor. Her light fawn suit
and her pale shoes and stockings were not
altogether a kindly setting for her extreme
slimness—the “divine” ankles and hands
seemed almost emaciated in their pallid sur-
roundings. However, the dominant note was
struck by Ruby Rich in a polar rigout of
cream cloth and Arctic fox. An accompani-
ment of sleigh bells and a pair of Russian
boots were all that was needed to transport
the gazer to the steppes. With the dancing-
lady came her capable-looking husband and
orchestra-conductor Wurmser. These two
kept up a polite conversation, mostly of quick
little bows and flashing smiles, with Feminist
chieftainesses during the tea-drinking.
Violinist Dag-mar Thomson, suggesting a
water-lily in her soft green trucking, played
very sweetly, and later on Neville Smith
sang of love and such things, but mostly in
the French tongue, so that, the afternoon’s
complacency was not unduly stirred.
An uproar like a blast from the Inferno
rent Pitt-street almost in twain on Friday
night when 500 undergrads raised their
voices at the Ambassadors. Taxi-drivers
paled, and the historic eab-liorse at King-
street corner fainted in its shafts. No Don
Cossacks, these young men who sang “with
lungs as tough as bellows” and then trot-
trot-trotted with their girls till Mungo
MacCallum turned down his thumb. The
gay uproar was the annual outburst of the
University Sports Unionists, and its chief
conspirators were president of the Sports
Union G. Stuckey, secretary C. Hill and
treasurer G. Portus. The Vice-Chancellor
Mac Calli; n couple were the bigwigs, and
mingled wit ii their foodstuffs were masses
of red roses twined with blue and gold
ribbons. Professorial Pedens were other
high-lights, Mrs. Peden swathed in black
velvets, which same sombre hue also clothed
Gladys Marks’s slimness. Tennis-expert Mrs.
Utz wrapped herself in a cape of roseate
feathers; Mrs. Fitzhardinge. wife of the
'Varsity rowing coach, did the honors among
the rowers in black softness emphasised by
a brilliant shoulder-posy; and brooding over
all was Vernon Treatt, vice-president of the
Union.
The very young Old Girls of the Pymble
P.L.C. put another blanket or two on the
college cot at the kiddies’ hospital the other
night with the takings from their dance at
the Wentworth. Eleanor Iceton-Smith, who
had worked overtime on her double job of
organiser and secretary, turned up as fresh
as the newly-sprung daffodil that had lent
its coloring to her froth of georgettes. Miss
Jobsou, the principal of the college, wasn’t
Present, owing to her sister’s recent death,
but sent Miss Kate Walker to represent her.
The ambassador thus gained a small rose-
garden in red and white to contrast with
her raiment of Tyrian dyes. Peggy Rogers,
Joyce Ludowici and Elspeth Cribb were
others on the childlike committee.
The Wentworth night indulged in by the
Vaucluse enthusiasts of St. Luke’s was a
smart dance in a week infested with college
sprees and cabarets. The ballroom, filled to
the brim with jazz Pavlovas and Novikoffs,
resembled a maypole gone wrong when the
dancers really got into the swing of it. Every
second girl sported the frivolous riband-
streamer that, taking its tempo from its
wearer, twirled wildly or decorously even as
she was whirled. Mrs. David McCathie,
who is president of the Vaucluse centre, wore
black moires purpled over with grapes like
a Swinburne ballad, and in the sober hand-
someness of sable velvets was matron Taylor.
Secretary Mrs. Hart rejoiced in lilac geor-
gettes. Mrs. Hartley Sargent wore soft
tulle over silver lace, and enfolded both with
a flame-like shawl - a handsome raiment.
The Arthur Eedys brought a party in which
were son Noel and his wife; and another
bright constellation was hostessed by Jean
and Clare Crowley.
All the world over black and white are
the colors of the Dominican convents, and
some old girls of St. Dominic’s felt a wave
or home-sickness for the colder and bleaker
countries of their schooldays when they saw
tiie familiar colors flying at the Ambassa-
dors the other night. It was a gay revel,
with youth at the prow and the wife of Dr.
Diethelm where her name would naturally
place her. But the first part of it had no
bearing on her official duties as president,
and the supper was as rich and rare as
usual. Each of the big convent schools sent
an ambassadress generally an ex-pupil
evolved into a smart young matron. Of these
Dr. Dan Kelly’s lady represented the Loretto
of Normanhurst, and Mrs. Biden the Loretto
of Kirribilli. Mrs. N. C. Man ion stood for
the Mercy Convent at Parramatta, and Miss
James for Monte Sant-Angelo. The dance
was like a beauty pageant—it would be safe
to claim that not one “homely” girl took the
floor. In fact, with so much pulchritude
abroad in the land, a snub nose and freckles
would rivet on their wearer the fascinated
gaze of everyone. The gate-money goes to
the building fund of the Dominican College
ar, Strathfield.
Unlike the theatrical dresser in Noel
Coward's “Hay Fever,” Mary Craven's taste
for the female
form hasn't
been blunted
notwithstand-
ing that she
has measured
or seen mea-
sured for cor-
sets more than
5000 women of
every age and
size. That
ord c a 1 was
necessary for
one who must
wed practical
experi ence
with enthusi-
asm for line
and curve if
she would
evolve the per-
fe c t corset.
For that is
the vivid-look-
ing lady's job in life —turning out a corset
suitable for every stage of modern woman-
hood. Starting with the Berlei people some
years ago as a designer, Mary Craven is now
one of the firm's heads. Periodically she
tours Europe and America to peer into their
Pandora’s glory-boxes, and from each trip
she brings back a fresh ray of hope to the
woman who is drawing close to that dreaded
shadow-line—the middle-aged spread.
To St. Philip’s on Church Hill went Vau-
dine Cooper, of Drummoyne, and Colonel
Charles Thane for their matrimonial rivet-
ing. White georgettes and old Honitan lace
formed the wedding garment, and bride-
groom’s sister Kitty ’maided in mauve and
silver. Congratulations and cake were
mingled at the Wentworth. Bridegroom’s
father is Dr. IJ.1 J . T. Thane, who till lately
dispensed health to a wide circle in Yass.
Captain George Capes, R.A.G.A., of the
Staff Corps, Victoria Barracks, has joined
the list of benedicts-to-be. The wedding is
booked for December. Pretty Alma Macgilli-
cuddy (you’ve heard fell of the Recks?),
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. Macgillicuddy,
of Kew (A T ic.), is the colleen. The tall guu-
nery officer, who has been best-man at quite
a crop of recent military weddings, landed
at Gallipoli on the epic date with a machine-
gun section. Later he received a personal
reference from Johnny Turk in the form of
a heavy dose of shrapnel in one arm.
Arthur Moreton Fitzhardingc, a son of
the Moreton Fitzliardinges of Summer Hill,
has mentioned his luck in getting the right
answer from Betty, eldest treasure of the
F. W. R. Braddoeks, of Rippon Lea, Wah-
roonga.
Not many of us have lived 90 years, but
Miss Margaret Ilouison, of Macquarie-street,
Parramatta, has done it on the one tiny
spot. The cottage in which she was born
stood on land just behind the house in which
she now lives, and when she had a birthday
party the other day she was honored as the
oldest native-born inhabitant of the ancient
town.
Herewith Percy Lindsay, who might
easily be taken for a benignant Nero if he
grew a fringe. One of the artistic Lindsays,
Percy is the
shy member of
the family who
never takes
the spotlight.
He simp ly
paints because
he must, and
is so modest
he is startled
at the voice of
praise. He has
just opened up
a show of
landscapes at
the Macquarie
Galleries, o f
which the
vision is illim-
itable, but the
prices re-
strained. Percy
is one of Tiie
B U L L E TIN’S
constant black-
and-wliite contributors. May Moore made
his picture:
It is only a little while ago that the
. Diggers welcomed Ethel Campbell to Aus-
t tralia. Now, as ‘'the Angel of Durban" is
! a sister of theirs, they will feel inclined
to wear black bands for her father, Dr. 8.
1 G. Campbell, from whom she got her war-
time enthusiasms. The family has numerous
! connections in Australia —among them the
Alfred Cowleys, of Brisbane; and they were
great war-workers, too.
, Writing from Rome, artist Margaret
Holden mentions long days of work in a
studio shared with an Australian chum. It
was discovered after many' l adventures in
eyries surrounded by less quiet domiciles.
Numbers of brush-and-palette pilgrims are
in the Eternal City from various parts of
this big island, and walking down a street
' adjacent to her own flat the Sydney woman
nearly bumped into artist Eirene Mort, also
of this town. So they talked it over at lunch
and agreed that the world is no larger than
a pancake.
The 434,820 votes which elected Nance
Lipman as Queen of the May in the Hos-
pital Saturday competition meant a tremen-
dous amount of energy on the part of her
supporters, incidentally illustrating the
energy the Chosen have to spare for causes
which interest them. Nance, a Bondi girl,
scored even more from that fact than from
her nomination by the municipalities, which
came to her greatlv by the influence of Aider-
man Goldstein, of Randwick, ex-Eastern
Suburbs M.L.A. Even solemn council meet-
ings were dragged for subscriptions and
votes; and the next candidate in order of
success —S. A. Quinscy, who had the Public
Service behind her —could secure only
188,887. Nance Lipman’s supporters paid
41812 for the privilege of voting, and as
45635 was raised by the contest the energy
put into it had a useful result.
When Dr. Sydney Morris, Director of
Maternal and Baby Welfare, reached the
Feminist Club the other day for his heart-
to-heart talk about pre-natal care of the new
citizen he carried his little bag. This caused
great delight among the voluntary aides run-
ning the tearooms for the T.B. funds.
“Gosh!” whispered the youngest—“he’s
brought the baby.” However, Ruby Rich,
the bigwig of the Feminists, wasn’t called
upon unexpectedly to play the part of god-
mother ; the contents of the bag remained
uncorked, but Feminists lapped up the stream
of wisdom on mothereraft that fell from
the visitor’s lips. Dr. Watson Muuro and
the Karitane matron, Miss McMillan, were
others who alternately purled and complained
over birth-rate matters in this State. Mrs.
Weersma, of Java, added a few of her many
words to the talk, and presently, brown of
arm and neck and face, a band of Y.A.’s,
with tea-urns and in their attenuated white
uniforms, descended on the gathering like a
small army of life-savers.
Martin-place is not to be the happy-go-
lucky, _ gaudy inconsequence of ordinary
“days” when the Red Crossers stage their
appeal in the spring. Artists arc to design
a scheme of decoration, and, lest their noises
clash with its color-vibrations, no collection-
boxes are to be wielded. A furnished house,
with the land on which it is built, is to be
the first prize in a monster art union for the
Cause. The organiser of the day is art-
specialist De Groot.
An unusual type is Kathleen Court, the
Sydney girl who has been adjudged winner
of the movie-queen beauty competition organ-
ised by the Buotoplayer. There’s a like-
ness to pictures of the Stuarts in the slim
face with its chin that is at once pointed and
rounded-—a haunting face framed by hair
bobbed very much in the fashion of the
pages who might have waited on Mary of
Scots. The apple thrown to this Helen is
a trip to Hollywood and back, with all
expenses paid. On arriving at Los Angeles
she will be handed the keys of that city by
the Mayor, and will be greeted by Douglas
Fairbanks and Mary Bickford.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite is still
wondering at the amount of publicity given
to Miss Teddy Cornwall, who at the Marist
Brothers Old Boys’ dance wore (among other
things) a gold anklet with a diamond clasp.
The G.1.F.0. says she wore clocks on her
stockings, and hadn’t so much as a hand
pointed at them !
She's a pretty girl, sprite-like and appeal-
ing—the type the novelists tell ns can't fail
to appeal to the innate chivalry of the male.
She was coming from the last meeting at
Warwick Farm, and. being a lightweight
found herself at the last moment hustled
into a compartment already crowded with
the dominant sex. There was no time to
look for a better possie; but when the con-
ductor came along to rise the tickets, she
asked him if he could find her a seat. The
conductor shook his head. “I'm sorry. Miss,”
said he ; _ “the train's crowded out. But” —•
in a whisper—“there’s a man in this car-
riage who’s travelling on a second-class
ticket. I'll see if I can’t make room for
you.” He approached the offender. “That
young lady,” he said, “has a first-class ticket
and is standing. I must ask you to let her
sit, or you must pay the extra is. 3d.” Gala-
had leaned back. “I’ll pay the Is. 3d.,” lie
said; and she of the appealing brown eye
stood all the way from Warwick Farm.
Old Sydney Grammarians are promised a
night of nights on July 9 when their annual
dance will be staged at the Ambassadors.
Tickets can be got from secretaries G,
Throsby and A. H. Curlewis.
Miss Brisbane tells of many giddy whirls:
Eleanor Ross, of the Sydney Conservatorium, who has
been up here in connection with the Windsor Eistedd-
fod, was feted by the Women’s Club in a setting
of red and gold chrysanthemums. Mrs. Wedd said
the guest was opening a new field for women, for
hitherto men had been chosen as judges. There was
a big roll up of members.
The Press Institute has had a palaver at Lennon's,
where president and Mrs. Sanderson Taylor, in navy
crepe de Chine, held out a hand to the members.
The tables were decked with yellow chrysanthemums,
and the throng included the M. L. Readings, the
Sligoes. Professor and Mrs. J. J. Stable, the Nott,
Phoebe liirwan and M. Forrest dames, Percy Reay
and his spouse, Winifred Ponder, General Spencer
Browne and the Firrnin McKinnons.
Warwick has been breaking forth in picnic race
festivities under cold grey skies. Mrs. Barnes wore
navy to the first race meeting; Mrs. George Evans,
cigar brown ; Mrs.' McDougall, hand-’broidered cloth.
Mrs. Scott Macleod, of Terrica, had fox furs with
her navy; and the Dave Cullen lady was in grey.
The Race Ball was held in the Exhibition Building,
where easy chairs and electric radiators made the
lounge cosy for the sitters-out. Mrs. Clive Evans
was in salmon pink; apple-green decked the Fletcher
maiden from Goondiwindi; Mrs. Marshall (Glenlyon)
wore jade green; Kitty St. John (Brisbane) white
satin.
St. Hilda’s Old Girls and the Old Southportonians
had a shivoo in the National Hotel. Miss Bourne
shook them by the hand, and there was a cheer y
crowd. Dancing is just the thing for the bleak
weather which suddenly swooped upon us this week,
just when the drapers were beginning to growl about
our having no winter. Bunny, in all shades, is now
seen on the streets, with the rosy nose that accom-
panies the piercing westerly.
Leila Baynes, sister to the champion sculler and
daughter of Arthur Baynes of Chelmer, has promised
to look after Dr. Phil Dixon, son of the E. V.
Dixons, of Sydney. She is a well-known golfer and
athlete.
To help the City branch of the C.W.A., Robert
Phllp’s widow arranged a party at Loehaber. Red
and white roses and brown chrysanthemums decorated
the scene, and Mrs. Spencer Browne, Mrs. Carew
Smyth and Owen Jones, Pearl Lahey, Miss Mr Clay
and Emmie Stewart gave the music; and Mrs. J. J.
Munro, Hilda Park and Eve Francis were other
helpers. Dame Philp was in black marocain with
a wide black hat.
Saturday’s rowing on the river was done under a
blue sky. Students gathered at the Commercial Row-
ing Club sheds to cheer their fellows, the blue and
grey of the Church of England Grammar coming first
in the Head of the River cpntest; Southport second;
Brisbane Grammar third. In the afternoon Hamilton
Reach saw the eight-oar race, the Koopa and Otta
shadowing it. The E. H. Ruddles had a party aboard
the Merrywing, and G. \V. Wat more had another on
the Stradbroke.

The onslaught of winter, which lias been
sudden and seyere, has brought flapperdom
out in a uniform wrapping of white, bear or
goat; the shingled heads of dozens of smart
maidens rise nightly at theatre and dance
from shoulders swathed in the skin of some
albino beast. Boat-race Night was remark-
able for the array of white-furred coats seen
at Ilis and later at the top-notch
cabarets. Possibly this sudden affection
lor wraps of the polar sort accounts for the
more reasonable prices attached to fur coats
or darker hue in the shops. Of course, they
are mostly rabbit when they aren’t cat, no
matter what the label calls them ; but in the
past the price-ticket lias generally tried to
live up to the poetic description of “mink,”
“sable,” “ermine” or “fox.”
The first of a trio of entertainments to
raise funds for the S.P.O.A.’s home for
decayed and indigent gee-gees, a ball at the
Embassy, had as side-lines stalls for the sale
of sweets, smokes and other trifles. Bill
liyson, who auctioned like an old hand, put
his Animal Week cartoon under the hammer,
and raked in 20 guineas for the suffering
nags. Mrs. Gorrie Gardner, who secretaried
the event, was. garbed in various blue shades;
I >r. Maudsley s lady, who was president,
figuring m brocade of black and gold. llclp-
ing with the sales were Mrs. Harold Clapp,
robed in glistening black, and Mrs. Richard
I I teller, in a coat of cyclamen georgette
covering a gown of the same hue with em-
broidery of beads. Mrs. Lort Smith (she
used to be Miss Montgomery), with other
Purple- Cross Service workers, gave friendly
aid. The Barrie company came after the
show, and Mary Macgregor, with gold roses
bordering a cream satin frock, vended raffle-
tickets. Lady Hastings featured the jumper
evening-raiment, with skirt of frosted gold
lame and a clinging body-garment of leaf-
green tone; and Joan Chirnsidc was encased
in black velvet with diamente outlining
of ivory lace.
Animal Week was brought to a close with
* l S'ymkluma on the V.A.T.G. grounds at
Caulfield, organised by the Women’s Auxili-
ary of the S.P.C.A. The afternoon was
bright and warm, enticing many well-turned-
out women riders, mostly hunt-club mem-
bers, to show how well they can manage their
splendid mounts. Even the youngsters
found events in which they could compete,
and naturally the huntsmen themselves had
to furnish some sport. Sweet- and refresh-
ment-stalls and fortune-telling booths helped
to occupy the time of a crowd mostly con-
sisting of friends of the competitors. 'Presi-
dent ( harlie Lort Smith was a ’flu vic-
tim, so could not attend the frolic; but iiis
wife was there. Mrs. Oscar Lempriere, Mrs.
G. James and Mrs. McL. Duigan had the
flowers under their care, and Mrs. Harold
Reeves, Mrs. E. r ]\ Enabling, the Misses
Moore and Marion Montgomery, who looked
very smart in her riding-suit with its coat
ot shepherd s plaid, were also willing work-
ers. Nell Wimpole, who was about the most
attractively-tailored of the riders, rode Miss
1. Hagenauer’s mounts as well as her own
nominations Miss Hagcnauer having dislo-
cated her collar-bone in a fall tlie previous
day. : Gwen Johnston, daughter of tlie
general, was another who sat her steed with
distinction. But the sensation of the day was
the plucky jumping of Ruth Dale, quite a
small girl. The hunter’s horn will be heard
at Berwick on Monday calling the pink-
coats to the first meet of the season.
Many limousines drew up in the grounds
o Stoiimgtoii when the Lieut.-Governor’s
mdy called the roll of the Victoria League,
a lie business was consideration of arrange-
ments for the annual dance on July D at St.
Ixilda Town Hall—this year funds are re-
quired to organise women’s institutes in the
country Last year's ball resulted in £7OO
being gleaned, and the coming hop, which
mil have the presence of the new State Gov-
orner and Lady Somers, is expected to bring
Vrn mor i e * , bristoc/ratic-looking Edward
Miller dame, who undertook to pay for the hall.
Mas elected president of the ball committee.
in ancy.lrvine and Sylvia Greene agreed to
share the duties of ticket secretary, and Elli-
son S powers promised further assistance in
the pen department. Mrs. .T. S. Fraser
offered to foot the bill for tlie band, and Mrs.
Harry Emmerton’s offering was the decora-
tion of the supper tables. Sundry other folk
passed in a bit towards expenses. Tea was
spread m the dining-room amid pink roses
set among crimson foliage.
Minnie Everett, producer of the Gilbert
and Sullivan operas at His Majesty’s, had to
go before the curtain when it fell on “The
Pirates of Penzance” on Saturday night to
accept a regular mountain of bouquets. She
smiled her thanks in a glistening gown like
a Canterbury bell. A packed house renewed
acquaintance with the pirate-king in- crimson
coat, skirted, belted and booted, and his
associates in washing-day blue jackets and
red caps. The lasses were of the period when
curls, high-waisted long gowns, low-cut to
reveal sloping shoulders, were the mode, and
when gentlewomen were supposed to have
gentle manners. In the effectively-lighted
cloistral ruins scene Strella Wilson had a
sash of white trailing over a lemon-colored
taffeta gown, and Mabel Gibson was restful
to the eye with white fichu upon pale-blue
satin. Pert shingled misses cast looks of
disdain upon the boudoir mob-caps and the
lace-adorned white dressing-gowns donned by
maidens of those days when, roused from
their slumbers. Ada lieeve, coated in ombre
clienille-cmbroidered velvet, had the fore-
ground of a stalls'box. Mrs. Geoffrey Syme
with Mrs. Haggard and two younger daugh-
ters made a decorative family group in a
d.-c. box. Opposite was the Tallis lady in
an ermine-collared wrap. Percy Deane and
his pretty wife were in the front row. and
the usual bevy of first-nighters drew then-
new white fur coats around them.
The Taits wear satisfied smiles these days,
for the Toti dal Monte season at the Audi-
torium is proving vastly successful. The
cheerful-looking star, with beaten gold scat-
tered over her flared apparel of tourmaline
pink, collected armfuls of dahlias and giant
chrysanthemums on Saturday night after the
“One Fine Day” aria, sung so beautifully
that the audience sighed for a chance of hear-
ing the whole opera with the lady in the
name-role. The singer still indulges in the up-
lifting of her hand when about to tackle an
intricate passage, a gesture suggesting a tight-
rope walker getting balance; there is always
a barely-perceptible pause before the fire-
works, which deepens the impression.
William James, at the Steinway, is proving
a star turn of the Toti dal Monte concerts.
Not only his solos, but his accompaniments
for the soprano and her assisting baritone,
are making patrons sit up and take notice.
The Aussie pianist-composer has been ad-
judicating: at various big musical competi-
tions ; -and from Launceston, in the Apple
Isle, came the tribute the other day that
this was the first year there had been no
complaints over the awards.
This is a Lafayette study of Wilma Berk-
ley, the Australian singer whose notes have
been described
by one London
critic of great
tonnage as
crystal - clear.
Yet she
doesn’t seem to
get much of a
chance to cash
them. When
the young
singer showed
promise of a
unique future,
interested
Melbouru e
friends pro-
vided funds to
help her
abroad; but
though she has
been there
three years
she has yet to
make the de-
sired mark in London. Now, therefore, act-
ing upon advice from musical authorities
over there, her friends here have started a
movement to finance a tour of the provinces
and Scotland, so paving the way, it is hoped,
to a secure footing on the concert-platform
of London.
The secretary of this State’s Victoria
League, Elsa Grice, of the John Grice
family of good citizens, has her hands full
these days organising women’s institutes.
This is a new idea, borrowed from the Eng-
lish women’s guilds. The institutes are to be
founded for “education, recreation and social
intercourse” in country towns of not more
than 4000 inhabitants where technical
schools and other amenities are lacking.
The aim is the “advancement of home in-
dustries, arts and handicrafts,” competent
teachers of which will visit the various
branches at the monthly gatherings of
members. At these meetings members will
bring, along samples of their work for
criticism and hints. Two branches have been
launched already—at Macedon and Flinders.
Harold Rodgers, who generally associates
with the piano when the Austral Salonites
are handing round teacups, had to come from
behind the lid of the grand on Saturday
night and take the role of host. His sister
Clarice was hostess, dressing the part in
gold tissue and georgette with floral pattern-
ing. Jazz, with interludes of the other sort
of music, made up an evening that every-
body said was awfully nice.
Muratti, the Ben Chaffoy gift gee-gee
which was raffled for St. Vincent's Hospital
appeal, brought in, it was found, when all
h** were counted, £13,500. The drawing
of _<o,ooo shilling tickets was done pub-
licly, the Ilennessy lady, president of the
appeal committee, picking the colt’s new
owner. The winner, who held live tickets
is a young farmer and ex-Digger, Jack
Mcßostie, of Birclup.
After an absence of more than four years
the Hon. Mrs. Nigel Somerset has returned
to visit her mother, Mrs. G. Irwin, at South
larra. The little lady has relatives in three
States waiting to welcome her; her father
is a well-known Westralian. Mrs. Somer-
set s home is at Poona, India, where her
husband. is stationed with his regiment. The
Hon. Nigel, who is coming to Australia in
July to spend his furlough, is Lord Raglan’s
younger brother, and was one of Sir Archie
ei gall’s staff in Adelaide.
John Farmer is another Melbourne artist
who graduated from the school of Meldrum.
With his wife
—she used to
be Poll y
Hurry, and
was and is a
painter, too—
he recently re-
turned from a
three years’
sojourn on the
Continent and
in England,
where they
both learned
s o m e new
ways of lay-
ing paint on
canvas. They
joined the
artistic coterie
a t Montpar-
nasse in Paris
for a while,
and later
o s t a blished
themselves in a flat in St. John’s Wood, out-
side London. A short visit to Holland gave
them a glimpse of the famous tulip-fields
and the art treasures of the Hague Galleries.
Alter an aeroplane flight back to the Great
Smoke, a week’s sojourn in Scotland and a
few days in Cornwall enriched the artists’
sketchbooks. Many of their gleanings were
shown at a recent combined exhibition at
the Athenaeum Hall. Though Mr. Farmer
is one of a family of 10, he is the only
member who gets his bread off a palette.
He reckons that he inherits from his grand-
father, who was the first steel-engraver to
come to this State and had keen discernment
for the best in art.
Madge Freeman, a Bendigo girl who has
been studying in France and Italy for two
years, has evidently abandoned ideas of an
art career. She was married in London last
month to Lanpear Thompson, also a well-
remembered Bendigonian, who now holds a
Government appointment in West Africa.
The honeymoon was spent motoring through
rural England. They will live in Ashanti
unless they move on to Brazil.
The McEacharn lady left hurriedly by the
ACneas in response to a cable announcing
the death of her man of affairs—Abernetliy,
of the London office of Mcllwraitli, Mc-
Eacharn and Co., the shipowners. Other-
wise her trip to Australia in search of
health would have extended another two
months.
Prince Melikoff and his consort, whose
marriage was an Apple Isle sensation a few
months ago, are flatting at Chelsea Court
before going on to Sydney.
The committee which has set itself to
extract £55,000 from the public for the
Children’s Hospital has commandeered the
liner Naldera for a charity hop. The date,
d.v. and strikers permitting, will be about
July 2.
Arthur Jordan’s farewell recital at the
Assembly Hall found the singer still affected
with huskiness. The British Music Society’s
quartette, led by Alberto Zelman, gave the
tenor its backing in some of the numbers,
and Mrs. Zelman’s mezzo-soprano voice was
heard in several songs, including Schumann’s
“Green Hat,” which, of course, was written
long before Michael Arlen’s naughty heroine
was born or thought of. Jordan introduced
the audience to' a beautiful “Ave Maria,”
by Cesar Franck, which can be recom-
mended to church-choir soloists as a wel-
come variant upon the too-often-heard Schu-
bert and Bacli-Gounod settings. Vaughan
Williams’s song cycle, “On Wenlock Edge,”
was the tenor’s chief offering. The audience
was somewhat sparse, for contra-attractions
were many.
Mrs. Simon Staughton, with her cabin-
trunks packed for Canada, said an revoir to
many friends when her mother-in-law, Mrs.
T. H. Skene, joined by Mrs. Seton Williams,
engineered a bridge party at Melbourne’s
most select Alexandra Club. The parting
guest was in a suit of natural kasha cloth,
worn with a topcoat of light brown, the
attachments being of Belgian hare.
The recital of chamber music at the
Melba Hall by Prof. Bernard Ileinze, cellist
Louis Ilattenbacli and pianist Edward (101 l
delighted a congenial audience. The Brahms
“Tl-io in B Major” and the "Kreutm-
Sonata” were played in a way that atoned
for the hardness of the seats and the dis-
comfort of a journey through streets lashed
by rain and fanned by an icy blast. Mozart’s
“Trio in E Major,” indifferently well played,
was rather lukewarm fare for such a cold
night, but otherwise the critics had a holi-
day. The new Ormond professor would be
well advised, by the way, to train his audi-
ences not to applaud between movements.
Maisie Thomson demonstrated her gifts
as a pianist at the Queen’s Hall with a pro-
gramme that ranged all the way from such
cut-and-dried classics as Haydn variations
down to the subtle harmonic experiments of
such moderns as Godowsky and Palmgren.
Her sister Eileen, whose covering was of creme-
de-menthe hue, lifted up a fresh soprano
voice which blended sweetly with obligatos
by flautist Richard Oliugg. Quantities of
posies were handed up to each of the lasses
by a pleased audience; the Barrett knight
and his lady, the Frank Clarkes and Mrs.
William a’Beckett helped to cheer the youth-
ful music-makers.
Wedding bells across the Strait: —
In St. David’s Cathedral Phyllis Mary Bisdee, off-
spring of the 0. E. Bisdees of Melton Mowbray, was
handed over to W. F. Archer, of Brickenden, Longford.
The bride was draped in white chiffon and silver lace,
and diamond earrings (his gift), sparkling beneath a
silver and pink coronet, held the long tulle veil
in place. Two ’maids and two little trainbearers
were arrayed in flame georgette and silver. The
wedding feast was spread at the Imperial.
At All Saints’ Church, Dorothy Archer, daughter
of the Squire of Huntsworth, Jericho, promised to
obey Edwin Cottier, of Sandy Bay. Archdeacon
Whitington heard her. The bride wore an uncom-
monly pretty gown of ivory crepe roniaine with
petal skirt and crystal embellishments. The tulle
veil-train was topped with a coronet of diamente
and orange buds, Her aunt, Mrs. R. D. Walch, enter-
tained the wedding guests at the Continental.
Sister Adelaide’s record of a brisk week:—
Races, a Government House reception and a
mayoral ball have been the chief items of the G.-G.'s
visit, with a dinner or two and a small musieale at
Government House by the way. For the ball the
Town Hall was transformed. A canopy of multi-
colored muslins—all greens and rose, and purple and
mauve and white—veiled the ceiling, and reduced its
towering height; organ and organ-galleries disap-
peared behind black satin hangings that were a back-
ground for a monumental Tutankhamen flanked by
sphinxes and smoking censers; and walls and pillars
were stencilled with Egyptian figures and hiero-
glyphics. Scarlet, blue and green were the predom-
inating colors; there were palms grouped about
the base of the pillars, and drapings about the door-
ways, and in the supper-room flags entirely covered
the walls, and the flowers on the table were warm
orange. The mayoral Bruces—she in gold, with a
touch of jade and kingfisher-blue, with a rose and
a blue-clad daughter near by—said their how-d’-dos
on a canopied dais, and a handshaking that began
at eight was only just over when the first of the
official guests—Melbourne’s Mayor Brunton —arrived
at 8.35. Frocking was anything from knee-high to
draped and trained. Lady Stonehaven’s green geor-
gette tapered into a panel train, and Lady Bridges
was in opal and bronze-beaded silver tissue. There
were five debutantes.
Gloomy weather-prophets to the contrary, the
S.A.J.C. struck fine weather for its first two days,
but a bitter wind . sent women hastily to the
shelter of their coats and furs, and reduced to
shivering and blue-lipped misery the scatter-brained
few who’d forgotten them. Felt hats were in a
ninety-to-one majority, most of them small, but
here and there one spread its brim wider and
twisted it into a hint of a picture-hat; colorings
were wine and green and bois-du-rose, with the
inevitable browns not quite so inevitable as they
have been. Lady Stonehaven’s cinnamon marocain
of Saturday gave way on Cup Day to sand-colored
kasha, and Lady Bridges exchanged bois-du-rose
for rust-color, with her daughter in smart green.
The tailor-made is coming more and more into its
own again at races, and few things are smarter,
especially for the woman who prefers saddling-
paddock to lawns.
A reception at Government House opened the
week, with the investiture of the latest of the Empire
knights, Senator Wilson, as an incident. There was
dancing in the ballroom and supper in a marquee
on the lawn, and there was frocking to suggest
that the drought had not entirely reduced us to
insolvency. Lady Stonehaven was in sequined and
diamented pink georgette, its godet points dipping on
either side, and a gleam of purple showed through
the gold lace of Lady Bridges, with its headings
of pillar-box red.
Another incident of the week is Gwen Barringer’s
exhibition of paintings at the Society of Arts’ rooms,
opened by the Governor. It is her sixth here, and
promises to be the most successful.
Wide sympathy goes to Captain S. A. White on
the death of his wife, a daughter of the late Samuel
Toms. She was greatly identified with his work,
both as explorer and ornithologist, and did much to
help him. She accompanied him on some of his
longest and most arduous trips, her record being
a 1000-mile camel expedition through an almost
waterless district.

Let a British Car reflect your pride of ownership.
FOR the first time in history the journey
from CAPE to CAIRO has been
accomplished by motor-car. Once
again the apparently impossible has been
achieved by CROSSLEY CARS. No other
car in the world has ever completed this
gigantic task. Thirteen thousand miles through
unknown country where no roads exist, through
veritable seas of mud, across rivers and over
the desert. More than once the cars were
completely submerged, but the journey alwajrs
went on to its final triumphant conclusion.
This is the kind of service all Crossley Cars are
built to give. They succeed where other cars
fail. In this Cape-to-Cairo journey they have
demonstrated again their extraordinary quality,
their soundness of design, and their strength.
All Crossley Cars are built to one standard—
the highest. Whether you are interested in
the popular 15-30-h.p. (R.A.C. Rating 15.6)
from £495, or the 19.6 (the car which broke
all R.A.C. Certified Trial Car Mileage Records)
from £B9O, it will pay you to ask for details

“The abrupt closing of your Shakspeare Fund came
as a surprise. Had it been for a statue for indbag
or other racehorse celebrity in Australia, the sub-

S. M. Herald.
Wot does ,’e know erbout it ? Spare me days!
•Oo in the world a statue wants to raise
To Windbag or to any other ’orse?
Their glory rests on more than footlin’ plays.
Carbine, E.urythmie, Gloaming and the rest.
Wot need of bronze or marble to attest
Their deeds as long as never sun goes down
Upon the barney as to which wos best ?
Poets —an’ statues, too —Time chips and breaks,
And ’oly shows of lots of ’em it makes.
’Is fame is builded on a firmer rock,
The prad ’oo lives on wot ’e lifts in stakes.
No bloomin’ doubts of wot ’e didn’t or did,
When figures spruik there’s nothin’ can be ’id.

For Shakspeare let ’oo will'send round the ’at.

“’Ad it been Windbag!” oh, there’s dirt in that.
A nasty sling-off! But we needn’t fret,

* * * * •
C. T. Godby, of Heroic and Parser celeb-
rity, has brought a useful team to Randwick and
started some members of it at TattersalFs (Tub
meeting on Saturday. He scored in the Hurdle Race
with Jollity (5 to 1), a Comedy King—Ellen Graeme
gelding, but his English mare, Miss Meadowes (6 to
1), failed in Tattersall's Stakes, nine, furlongs, which
went to the Don Reynaldo—Andol gelding, Donald
(10 to 1), although she is likely to do better when
more seasoned. New Hope (Volta— Espoir Dore),
another of Godbv’s, trailed the pacemaking. Loquat
(7 to 2) in the Winter Stakes and looked like winning
when the other cracked up. In the end he was
beaten into third place by Resource (7 to 2) and
Tibbie (9 to 2), but his price will be considerably
shorter than 14 to 1 the next time he starts.
Resource, who was in the pink of condition, has
placed a lot of money to J. J. Leahy’s credit this
season, and Farthing, who hasn’t been much in
the limelight lately, had an easy ride. Hunter was
seen to advantage on Janitor (8 to 1) in the Flying
Handicap, six furlongs, quite holding his own with
Toohey on Wedding Eve (4 to 1), who perhaps
prefers a longer distance; but Toohey was at his
best —and his best is very good*—on Amusement (6
to 1), a brother to Sum King, in the youngsters’
handicap and Aorangi (8 to 1) in the Welter. For
the latter race Honan was favorite, but he doesn't
seem to care for a big field and he never emerged
from the ruck. However, his bright appearance
suggests a win for this good horse, when suitably
placed, and the serviceable Aorangi has not reached
the end of his tether, while Nostalgia should be
ready for a Welter in two or three weeks.
* . * .* *
Punters had no cause for complaint at San-
down Park (lie.) on Saturday, as five of the seven
events —the Purse was divided —were taken by first
favorites, and the other two winners were well
backed.. The rather disappointing Textile (3 to 1)
was most in demand for the Park Handicap, one
mile, and, taking charge as they rounded the home
turn, he won by a length from old Englefield (12 to
1), who made his run too late, with Coolness (4
to 1) a head away; time Imin. 42sec. The winner,
who was fancied for the last Caulfield Cup but is
at his best over a shorter distance, is by Green Seal
—Bradford Lass, and E. J. O’Dwyer trains him for
C. G. Brown. That good sprinter Prince Tressady
(4 to 1), with Cairns aboard, rewarded his . backers
in the Sandown Plate, Farr (16 to 1) being a neck
away and All Sunshine (10 to 1) a fast-finishing
third. All Sunshine should be an early winner; six
furlongs is not his distance. A promising filly in
Alan Currie’s Lady of Lille (Rizzio—Lilloise) ran
away with the two-year-old race, for which she was
favorite at 7 to 4; and Daniels, who rode her,
was also successful on Micronesia (5 to 2) in the
Welter. Micronesia scored rather well over hurdles
at Caulfield some time back and may be useful in
similar events this winter.
* * * *
Invaders from Melbourne had a good time
at the S.A.J.C. Cup meeting. Following on the
successes of Ben Lomond, Belgamba, The Night Patrol,
Grecnsborough and Spearer on the first day at
Morphettville, the last-named gelding, who is by
Spearhead, a grandson of Carbine, out of Francette’s
Daughter, won the Adelaide Cup. A report that he
had been hurt in the Fisher Handicap put many off
him, but he showed no sign of the alleged injury in
the big race, which he won by half a neck from
Stralia, who had his turn last year, with Caserta
a respectable third and Frances Tressady fourth, the
13 furlongs being traversed in 2min. 47,isec. Spearer
returned £4 18s. on the £1 tote, Stralia’s div. (a
very good one in the circumstances), being £4 5s.;;
Caserta was favorite. The winner earned £2150 and
a trophy worth £100 for his owner-trainer, H.
Gymer; he was ridden by Ashley Reed, who was
also associated with his Albury Cup victory. Adel-
aide horses had a turn on Saturday, when, among
others, D. Rasheed’s Paroodus (Daius—Porooma.)
won the S.A.J.C. Handicap, 12 furlongs, paying £13
12s. for £1, and Haoma, a warm favorite, collected
the Steeplechase. The old fellow fenced beautifully,
and got a great reception.
“Hasen”: The Ben Lomond tote dividend of
£49 12s. on the Adelaide Goodwood Handicap was
followed by a brisk starting-price controversy, many
sharks announcing that they paid only on a 20 to 1
limit. According to Melbourne Sun, one of the
aggrieved parties happens to be “a bookmaker who
laid a fixed price against Ben Lomond, and invested
at tote odds the major portion of the money received
from clients,” which is uncommonly interesting.
Any bookmaker is at liberty to lay off some of his
liability if he feels he has taken too much. This
the subject of the Sun par. could have done with
brother fielders at a straight-out price. He preferred
the tote. In other words, he recognised that the
(locally) anathematised machine, after all deductions
and with a considerable contingency for second,
would probably pay better odds than Ire and his
tribe -were laying for a straight-out win. (Asa
fact, bets were laid at Epsom at 8 to 1 for a win, as
against the tote’s 484 to 1 for first and over 15 to .1
for second.) Was there ever a more illuminating
comment on the cloaked robbery that Victorians are
compelled to put up with because a wowserish Legis-
lature forbids totalisator betting?
* * * *
“Hamer”: The Night Patrol’s leg filled after his
gallop in the Elder Stakes, and he is to be
retired to the stud. He has had an exceptional
racing career. In four seasons in England the son of
Steadfast —Dark Flight got into the money in 24 of
the 38 races in which he started, winning 10 of them ;
in his two years in Australia he won 16 races and
was placed 11 times out of 37 starts. And he was
“aged” when he resumed practice in this country.
Lord Stradbroke did well with the big bay, reaping
£12,427 in stakes before selling him for £10,000;
and Gerald Buckley has collected £1325 in prize-
money. Barring accidents, Buckley should get the
other £8675 in three seasons at the outside; for the
services of so fine a horse will be in great demand.
* * * *
“Hasen”: That smart horse and excep-
tional weight-carrier, Waranton, capped some striking
recent performances at the Warrnambool (lie.) Gup
meeting. Handicapped at list. 121 b., and conceding
exactly three stone to the next in the weights, All
Serene, and sst. slb. to those on the minimum, he
won the six-furlong Wangoom Handicap by a com-
fortable length. This, on “a rain-sodden track!”
Waranton’s last three starts before that, each of

HUBBY: “Let me back one more horse. I promise you it’ll be

them a victory, were under weights of 9st. 131 b. in
the Bourke Handicap at Flemington (establishing a
new Australasian record for seven furlongs), lOst. 51b.
in the South Yarra Handicap at Caulfield, and lOst.
131 b. in the Plenty Handicap at Moonee Valley, all
in high-class sprinting fields. He has won seven out
of his last eight races. The honest old fellow
is now to get the spell he has so richly earned.
* * * *
“Bris”: Jimmy Gorman, one of Brisbane’s
leading lightweight jockeys, believes that dreams come
true —sometimes. Be was sitting down in the bird-
cage at Albion Park when a stranger came up
and asked him what he was riding in thq Second
Division. “Nothing,” said Jimmy; “I havefft got
a mount.” “That’s funny,” said the stranger; “I
dreamt you rode the winner, and beat Bach.” A
little later Gorman was offered the mount on Kinnoul.
He accepted, and rode Kinnoul to victory. Bach
(a hot favorite) was second.
* * * *
“Vedette”: At an auction sale of horses
at Palmerston North (M.L.) recently some
calamitous-looking specimens of the thorough-
bred were on offer, and bids were as hard to extract
as an admission from a bookmaker that he hasi had
a good day. “Yes,” said the auctioneer as a par-
ticularly unlovely animal adorned with the mud of
yesteryear paraded the ring, “he has five strains of
Musket in him. But I’ll guarantee he hasn t five
grains of oats,” he added as the equine hat-rack
was led away. #
Sydney lias learned what to expect when
two blacks are billed to fight, so it stayed away
numerously from the second meeting of Len Johnson
(list 241 b.) and “Tiger” Payne (list. 61b.) at the
Stadium' Payne took the thing seriously enough, but
Johnson, who always gives the impression that he
finds boxing a bore, was even more lackadaisical
than usual. Instead of piling up a big score by meet-
ing Payne’s rushes with a straight left, or jabbing
with that member while “Tiger” was making up his
mind for an attack, the supercilious Leonard was
content to either side-step and run or to glide into
a clinch. A little of this goes a long way with a
crowd, and Saturday’s assemblage fell to urging
Johnson to fight more and run less. Johnson got the
decision- when the play was played out.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: Who was “George Gunther, the
Australian negro,” to whom Carpentier makes copious
reference in his new book, “The Art of Boxing”?
George gave the Frenchman, then at the height of
his powers, two really good fights in April, 1912, and
March, 1913, losing the first on ’ points after the
full 20 rounds, and lasting till the 15th in the
second. Carpentier says he “possessed a special
punch, a right-hand dig—and what, a dig it was, too!
—with the space under the ribs as the objective.
It was a down-cut half-arm blow which, when it
landed properly, could take away any boxer’s breath.
Luckily I had seen Gunther in action and was pre-
pared for his specialty.” Incidentally, the alleged
Australian was the only black man whom Carp,
ever beat. The Dixie Kid and the unlamented Siki
knocked Georges out in a few rounds, and Joe
Jeanette whipped him on points.
* * * *
The wrestling season was ushered in at
Melbourne Stadium by Mike Yokel (U.S.A.) and
Billy Meeske, the Australian. There was plenty of
action in the affair, each contestant doing pretty
well everything to the other short of disembowelling
him and gouging out his eyes. Meeske has learned a
lot as the result of his trip abroad, and on the
score of versatility was all over the fat little Yokel,
whose name suggests a Hibernian Hodge. Mike,
however, possesses prodigious strength and endurance,
and was able to withstand most of the painful
wristlocks and toeholds that Meeske applied. He is
no mean actor to boot; the expression of acute
agony he worked up when Bill kept making him do
the “splits” in the fourth round would have done
credit to Guy Bates Post. Meeske gained the first
fall with a succession of headlocks in the fifth
round. Iff the following bout the visitor felled his
man with a “rabbit-killer,” picked him up, spun
him round, and chucked him on his head. While
William lay insen-ibid Michael was disqualified.
Each gentle creature weighed list. 1311 b., or said
he did.

The N.S.W. Coursing Association’s open-
ing meeting at Rooty
Hill was a benefit for
W. Buckley. He started
a solitary greyhound
in each of the three
events. Course b y
course they mowed
down the opposition
till, at the end of the
second day, each was in
the favorable position
of having a bye in to
the final. The Wood-
stock Cup decider be-
tween Clarrie Devlin’s
Dominion and Buckley's
Black Bess was hotly
contested; it was not
till the streaking
quarry wa s nearly
reached that the long-
striding Bess definitely
got her nose in front.
The other Buckley
noms., Bobs and
Bright Daisy, had pre-
viously raced away
with the Derby and
Oaks events and about
a half cwt. of “trophy”
cutlery and other
silverware. The “books”
were very circumspect;
5 to 2 Daisy and 4 to
1 the dog were the
best right-through
quotes at the opening
card-call, although tc
land either event meant
winning five courses.
At the second call the
pair were odds on. An
oddity of the draw was
tiie bringing together
first time out of Bobs '
and Oom Paul. History
repeated itsel U-ÜBobs
easily.

After having all the best of an unfinished
game against Surrey, the Australians secured their
first victory of the tour, a 10-wicket one, at Hamp-
shire’s expense. The county could get no higher
than ninth last year, but it has produced some fine
cricketers. Tennyson, Who captainCd England in
192.1, was absent; but the side ' included Mead,
still one of the foremost of professional batsmen,
who may yet follow “W.G.” and Hobbs into the hall
of fame reserved for makers of a hundred hundreds;
Brown, the run-getting wicket-keeper who was preferred
t.) Strudwiek in the last series of Tests in England : and
Kennedy, a bowler of much more than average
merit. Collins won the toss again and, with Bards-
ley, put 83 on the board for the first? wicket. After
that things might have gone badly but for a stylish
73 from Taylor’s bat and a hurricane 130 n.o. in
Gregory’s most cheerfully aggressive style. Coming
as it did when 7 wickets had fallen for 233, the
all-rounder’s contribution was invaluable; his bat-
ting has altogether eclipsed his bowling so far,
but whether the time may not come when fast
bowling will be worth more to Australia than fast
scoring is another question. Hants put up 152 in
their first innings (Bowell 46), and 248 at their
second attempt (Brown 78, Mead 46). The bowling-
honors went to Mailey in this his first match; he
finished with the remarkably fine analysis of 11
wickets for 131, which should send his stock ahead
of Grimmett’s, who has so far fallen below expecta-
tion. Macartney came through with 7 for 78, but
Everett’s two wickets were very costly. Ryder and
Taylor knocked off the small adverse balance of 33
without mishap.
The M.C.C. put a team into the field that con-
tained some of the country’s best amateur bats-
men, as well as Hendren. There were Carr, who is
to captain England presently; Stevens, admittedly a
Test possibility; Macßryan, of Somerset, one of the
most reliable of run-getting innings-openers, and
Chapman, whose hitting has turned the tide of many
a game. Also there was Falcon, who captained the
side, a bowler who has twice given Australians more
trouble than most. Andrews, Everett, Grimmett,
Ellis and Hendry stood out this time—the last is
laid up with scarlet fever and is unlikely to be
available for a month or two ; his enforced and re-
grettable absence is a reminder that taking 16 players
may have benefits to offset its defects. Collins lost
his coin-spin for the first time. It reads a pretty
good performance to rattle out an M.C.C. team for
a run short of 200. Carr and Mcßryan failed, but
Stevens (77), Hendren (33) and Chapman (51)
helped to put 170 on the board with only half
the side out; after that wickets fell like ninepins.
1 his was Richardson’s day at the creases, and few
who watched him last season in Australia and know
anything of English wickets doubted that it would
come, or that it will recur; he took 6 wickets for
85. That Collins should have put himself on
as second change, in Macartney’s ineffectiveness, and
captured 3 for 39 is perhaps less surprising than that
most people should have entirely forgotten how well
he bowled in England with the A.I.F. team seven
Years ago. It is a department in which he may yet
come again, like Macartney, if he is wanted.
Australia started with the tail-enders, Mailey and
Oldfield, to play out five minutes of time on Satur-
day evening. On Monday Haig, the fast-medium
bowler, did some steady damage. Collins (33) and
Macartney (61) put on over 80 for the fourth wicket,
but with 6 down for 154 things looked none too good.
However, the late-comers, Gregory (30) and Ponsford
(46 n. 0.), made a useful stand, and the side was
65 in the lead, with one wicket (Richardson was
the last man in) to fall when stumps were drawn.

Saturday's football in Sydney was notable
for the defeat of the premier clubs in both the
Rugby codes. Glebe overcame South Sydney by 14
points to 10 (2 tries and 4 goals to 2 tries and
2 goals) ; it was South’s first defeat since the start
of last season, the club having won 16 games right
off the reel. The victory of Glebe, re-inspired by
the return of Frank Burge, was so popular that
many of South’s supporters on the “Hill” sought
solace in fisticuff's. Glebe went out to crack up
South’s back division, and succeeded; and it was
well served by full-back Cummins, who played an
exceptional game. North Sydney surprised ' the
critics by beating St. George, 18 to 11, and Uni-
versity’s defeat of Eastern Suburbs, 19 to 3, was
another unexpected upset. The ’Varsity played a
rattling, fast game from the start, but the once-
formidable Eastern Suburbs team has fallen from
its high estate. Balmain vanquished Newtown, 8
to 5, after a tussle as full of stoush and rough stuff
as a first-grade game has any business to be. In
the Union competition an excited crowd saw Randwiek
run down the premiers, Glebe-Balmain, final scores
being 16 to 13. Morrissey played a magnificent
game in Randwiek’s almost faultless three-quarter
line, each of his side’s four tries being due to the
ex-St. Joseph centre’s openings. Playing the Maori-
land formation, Manly beat ’University by 15 points
to 13; the Eastern Suburbs forwards proved too
good for North Sydney, 17 to 3, and Western Sub-
urbs had the better of a close game with Y.M.C.A.,
9 to 6. In the Soccer competition the premiers,
Granville, had no trouble in downing Eastern Sub-
urbs, 4 to nil, their combined work leaving East
standing. Gladesville-Ryde beat Woonona, 4 to 2,
and Annamdale-Leichhardt finished 1 up on Balgownie
(0), The big game under Aussie rules saw Newtown
win from Eastern Suburbs at Erskineville by 57
to 47 (7 goals 15 behinds to 6—11).
“Shrewsbury”: A curious aspect of Sydney football
propaganda is the manner of computing the “gates”
for newspaper publication. A semi-official com-
munique states that Rugby League attendances are
much greater than for the corresponding period of
last season, and large increases in cash takings are
quoted. Reference to a scrap-book shows that this
season’s attendances at big club matches have been
rated at from 17,000 —the highest to time of writing
this—to 4000, whereas last year’s figures ran from
25,,000 to 5000. I don’t attempt to explain the dis-
crepancy beyond remarking that Truth has a habit of
eventually outing her persecutors.
“H. Hardupp”: In the minor match at Wentworth
Park on Saturday the punctuation of the game by
the referee’s whistle became monotonous, and the
man in the seat ahead of me, who looked as if his
name should be Billo, was moved to sarcasm.
“Bliine! it’s a pity lie’s only got one note on his
whistle,” he remarked. “With a few spare notes
he’d make an opera of it.”

Saturday’s Melbourne hoofball furnished
some thrilling finishes. On the far-out Essendon
ground, with 30,0.0 Q spectators surrounding- them,
the Richmond Tigers, seemingly a\ far better team
than last season’s, shook the ’Dons up solidly, racing
them goal for goal and point for point throughout.
Neither could get enough advantage to swear by,
and, with two minutes, to go, Essendon had but 2
points to the good. The Tigers attacked, but
fumbled a trifle; then a tricky ’Don forward, -skirting
outside the pack, whipped the ball through even as
the bell rang: ’Don, 69; Richmond, 61. Carlton,
also a vastly-improved team, visited Geelong and put
the wind up the Hubbites by keeping about level
till almost the close. Then Geelong, with a desperate
drive, got the ball down and through and saved
the bacon by 4 points—64 to Carlton’s 60. St.
Hilda went to South Melbourne and played like
schoolboys up to three-quarter time, when the tale
was, Saints, 21; South, 47. Recovering form in the
last quarter, St. Ivilda piled on goal after goal, while
South stood still, and at the bell it owned 50 points
to South’s 47. Fitzroy likewise sustained a series
of shocks, on its own ground, the hefty men from
Footscray having the better of the argument until
just before the finish ; ’Roy rushed a goal and averted
disaster by 3 points—Bo to ’Scray’s 77. Melbourne
amassed 119 points against North Melbourne’s 89;
and Collingwood also notched 119 against Haw-
thorn’s 47.
“Wink”: “Flagwagger” (B. 29/4/’26) reckons
Eason the greatest rover of all time. Barrackers
whose recollections go back 30 years hand that palm
to McGinis, who, round about 1900, took the hit-out
for Melbourne, that club having imported him from
Tas. Younger men talk of the spindle-shanked Dick
Condon. Dick was a wonder on the field, and his
brain evolved the “system” that has kept Colling-
' wood always near the top of the list.

THE INKY WAY.
Artist Harry Julius, who played a big part
' in the Labor publicity campaign during the
Queensland elections, had a compliment paid
him on Labor Day. His principal cartoons
were represented as tableaux in the proces-
sion. They were the outstanding success ot
the show.

burning at her home in Deal (Eng.), Mrs.
Louisa Alice Baker, a Maorilander with
several successful novels to her credit. Her
entertaining letters from England under the

papers for years. Latterly she had been
reader for a big London publishing house,
for which she “discovered” several popular
novelists. A son still lives in Maoriland.

Boomerang, published in July and August,
1918. When the s.s. Boonah was two days
out from England, one of our escort, the
auxiliary cruiser Marmora, was torpedoed,
and as all aboard the Boonah were invalids,
we had the wind well up for the next fort-
night. The Boomerang contained a report
of the torpedoing, and a diagram showing
the positions of the boats composing the con-
voy when the torpedoing occurred. At Cape-
town 2100 copies of the paper (10 pages)
were printed—-half of them threaded with

“Caesar”: One yarn about how Norman
Lindsay learnt boxing ought to be true, if
it isn’t. Norman listened to the voice of
those who declared that if he wanted to
live lie should go in for physical exercises,
and that, anyway, it was handy to know
the art of self-defence. He hired a granite-
faced pug. to come on stated days to the
studio to put him through his paces. He
had a conscientious teacher who pointed out,
with illustrations, that it was his duty to
administer punishment in order to teach
his pupil how to avoid it. After an agitat-
ing live minutes Norman stipulated for the
close of the session—he wasn't too well, he
said, but he would do better next time.
There was no next time. When the pug. was
due to arrive, Norman got out and kept out
until the conscientious man had filled in
the hour for which he was engaged, and dis-
appeared. But the pug. nearly found him
in twice ; once Norman had to make an escape
through a window". After that he sent a
cheque to the persistent pug. and called the
lessons off.
“Galley-proof” : The retail newsagents in
a certain area combined with a view to block-
ing the intrusion of outsiders. So when a
marauding distributor set up shop in the
sacred area, the combine put it straight to
the newspaper wholesalers that if they sup-
plied the trespasser the combine would with-
draw its custom. But it counted amiss, for
the newspaper folk also had their little ring,
and delivered an ultimatum that the new-
comer must be let in or no supplies would
be issued to the combine. This act the news-
agents declared to be the overt expression ot
a conspiracy to injure them, and off they
went to the court. There the Lord Chancel-
lor put the matter in a nutshell and cracken

blow, and when it was countered they ran
to the court for protection, all of which re-

attacks it, it defends itself.” He could see
no wrong-doing by the newspaper combina-
tion. And so it was —with costs, rhe case

An old story of adventure has been re-
called by a cabled reference to the finding
of a copy of the book of one Henry Zimmer-
man, ' published in Mannheim, Germany,
about the travels of Captain Cook. The
volume came to light in Switzerland. There
is a copy in the Mitchell Library, whilst a
French translation, also with the collection,
bears the mark “Very rare, made by
Mitchell himself. The author, whose name
is on the crew-roll of Cook s Discovery as
“H Simmerman, coxswain,” was an adven-
turer who had been many things. Hearing
of Cook’s intended voyage, he joined up, and
secretly kept a diary in abbreviated German,
from which, on his return, he hurriedly wroD
his book. It naturally lacks the exactitude
of the official account, which it forestalled,
but makes a good personal narrative. I n
author, in a preface, apologises for the
theft of the story rights of the voyage; bin
apparently the writing of the story was in
Zimmerman’s mind from the start.
W J. Geddis, managing director of the
N Z. Times, just dead at 66, was connected
with M.L. journalism for half a century. Be
spiked his first bit of copy as a reporter on
the Auckland Star at the age of i 6. Twelve
vears later he had climbed to the sub
editor’s chair. Then he went into partner-
ship with artist W. Blomfield bought the
OnsERVER a weekly, and founded the JN-a-
SSSnce and wild Daily Telegraph.
When they parted company Geddis, with the
aid of his old employers on the Star, Brett

Ike
ultimate engine!
THE one-cylinder car ran, and
that was all. The two-cylinder
car was noisy as a stone-crusher.
Next came the “four-in-line.” But
its defects were many —valve-
grinding was a monthly rite, car-
bon a scourge; and every auto-
motive engineer worthy of the
name was determined to get rid of
them.
FOLLOWED rapidly many
improvements. Heretofore, all
engines had been of the “T-head’
variety. They ate petrol and oil
like a high-powered yacht, and
they wasted half of it.
THEN ALONG CAME one who
moved both intake and exhaust
valves to the same side as the
cylinder. He cut off the overhang-
ing eave —and presto! —the “L-
-head” motor. A tremendous gain
in power. But owners still have to
have their valves ground and their
carbon periodically scraped away,
even as all, save “the elect,” do
nowadays.
ANOTHER TOOK the valves off
the side, put them on the cylinder
top, and cut off the other overhang-
ing gas chamber. Hence “valve-
in-head.” But still valve-grinding
and carbon troubles. It crept under
the valves. The faces became
pitted. To maintain efficiency,
carbon must be scraped as of old,
and frequently.
FINALLY, the new school of
thought in motor design. Came an
engine idea which absolutely and
completely revolutionised the
automobile engine.
Charles Y. Knight produced and
patented the sleeve-valve engine.
“I’ll go them all one better,’’ said
he. “At one fell swoop I’ll scrap
all those cams and push-rods, all
those springs and rocker-arms, and
by making a cylinder-head with
but a single opening for the spark
plugs I’ll increase compression.’’
RESULT—Multiplicity of valve
parts completely disappeared. Exit
valve-grinding. No more pound-
ing cams —noise cut to nothing.
Absence of all spring pressure,
added horse-power. And carbon
troubles, the disease and eventual
death of all other motors, were
cured, once and for all. Carbon
cannot harm the engine of a
Willys-Knight. It is actually a
helpful agent. It serves to seal
compression. Its only effect is to
better this engine’s functioning.
IT IS NOT EFFICIENCY to be
obliged to lose the use of your car
for hours and days, at the same
time contributing easily one-half
of the repairman’s total yearly in-
come as he grinds your valves and
corrects your carbon complica-
tions.

In clothes as vocal as herself, Dal Monte
aired her dramatic soprano again at the
Melbourne Auditorium on Thursday. A ten-
dency to produce some of her choicest notes
with the air and gestures of a prestidigitator
dredging rabbits from a hat is to be observed,
not necessarily with regret. A rapid deteri-
oration in the small diva’s artistic ideals is,
however, apparent in each successive pro-
gramme, and argues either a shrewd know-
ledge of her audiences or a lack of confidence
in her ability to carry through an evening’s
elevated entertainment on a concert platform
where the romantic trappings of grand opera
are replaced with a plain backcloth and the
naked glare of white electric light. The
process has not yet gone as far as singing
“The Keys of Heaven” with her baritone
batman, or inviting her hearers to join in
the choruses—the happy devices which made
Clara Butt a Dame of the British Empire—
but the worst is to be feared. Nevertheless,
her singing of “The Pearl Fishers” cavatina
(Bizet) on Friday and “One Fine Day” from
“Madame Butterfly” on Saturday, in which
she was exquisitely in place, were more than
reparation for too many English trifles. In
solo parts Augusto Beuf’s dramatic talent
impresses more than his vocal equipment.
When he rolls up his shirt-sleeves and knocks
Toti round the ring in hearty passages like
the duet “La ci darem la mano,” from “Don
Giovanni,” the exhibition is more exhilarat-
ing. There was another varied programme
on Tuesday; there will be a concert to-
night, and on Saturday the two will sing
Totl dal Monte, as seen by the leanest
member of The Bulletin’s staff.
good-bye—at any rate for tlie present. Wil-
liam James, the Australian who during the
war paralysed London audiences by drifting
casually in Digger’s uniform on to the piano-
stool at highbrow concerts and playing lofty
preludes with as finished artistry as any
long-haired virtuoso, continues to accompany
with sympathy and charm.
❖* * *
“The Pirates of Penzance” was the new
G. and S. offering at Melbourne Majesty’s on
Saturday. The inconsequential story of the
youth who, owing to the deafness of his
nurse, was apprenticed to a pirate instead of
to a pilot, ran for 363 nights on its first
telling in 1880. The present revival will
last a fortnight. A real play is this fantasy,
with no elaborate pretence of verisimilitude.
Everything happens as inevitably as a Bor-
nean folk tale; and as foolishly. It is a
pity some of the exponents cannot lot the
audience into the secrets they are set to tell.
Winifred Williamson as the pirate maid-of-
all-work is as undecipherable most of the
time as a cuneiform inscription. Charles
Walenn, although he was a good fool in the
previous piece as the Major-General, nearly
lets the present performance down by being
quite unintelligible through a lengthy aria in
the second act. Strella Wilson is helped
through the part of Mabel by her fetching
voice, which in this piece has exercise in
several of Sullivan’s most enchanting ditties.
The same may be said of James Hay as the
pirate apprentice. Bernard Manning is the
pirate lung and a worthy member of the
dynasty, and Sydney Granville a capable
sergeant of police.
* * * *
Once more the choruses bore the heat and
burden of the play, although in the second
act the ranks of the pirates were seen to be
seriously depleted, possibly owing to the
necessities of the police. The Colemans are
to be comitiended for the fine set in the first
scene of a rocky seashore on the coast of
Cornwall. It seemed from a distance to be
as seriously painted as the annual mastodons
of Lister Lister and was even larger. The
briefness of the show —it was over before
half after 10—suggests that the playwrights
counted on the multiplicity of encores to see
out an evening entertainment’s traditionary
span.
* $ st: *
Two Melbourne showhouses are threat-
ened with change. “The Nervous Wreck”
will recover miraculously from his com-
plicated diseases for only a few nights longer
at the Palace; Boucicault’s symphony orches-
tra will play “The Admirable Crichton” at
the King’s until the 28th, after which fre-
quenters are to be told “What Every Woman
Knows.” But the talkative “Bad Man” is
still in full blast at the Royal, and “Mer-
cenary Mary” continues to carry on at the
Princess. The best people—from the box-
office point of view, at any rate —are flock-
ing to view themselves at the Athenseum.
Melbourne Tivoli’s current divertissements
include what our cousins on the other side
of the Pacific call nut comedy. Some of
the nuts cracked prove to be chestnuts, and
all the act is idiocy, but, as expressed by
Storey and Lee, it is highly amusing idiocy.
Golda walks a wire and Patricolas risks
his neck to the general satisfaction; and
Scott Sanders is an English comedian of
familiar aspect who has been seen before.
The Rigolettos and the Swansons combine
to make a soup or seapie of nearly all the
recognised ingredients of revue.

The star turn at Melbourne Bijou is a
demonstration of the Charleston by an Aus-
tralian couple, Billy Heaton and lima
Strange. The new dance justifies the warn-
ings of American architects that when a few
hundred performers, following the laws of
chance, get into sten the powerful rhythm
will suffice to bring the stoutest palais down
upon its frequenters’ heads. Charles Sher-
man is a Yiddish entertainer at the piano
and Ernest Pitcher is a comedian, chiefly by
courtesy of the management. The Moon and
Morris revue company provides a new pro-
gramme that shows some improvement on
the last, and leaves room for more,
At Melbourne Majestic this week a mil-
lion-dollar ship is blown to fragments and a
thousand people rush shrieking to safety pur-
sued by a roaring leopard every afternoon
and evening. “The Highway Girl” is the
name of the explosion. “Drusilla with a
Million” is a “thundering drama,” and “See-
ing Things” is a “screaming farce.” Evi-
dently, as far as this theatre is concerned,
the silent drama is a misnomer. Lou Telle-
gen is “The Outsider” at Hoyt’s. Mosco-
vitch played the part here in three dimen-
sions. Comparisons of the rounded version
and the flat is all in favor of the former.
Little of the complicated give and take of
passion in the original play intrudes upon
the screen. Jacqueline Logan is the twisted
girl whom the irregular healer straightens
by means of hypnotism instead of on a rack,
and although a momentary thrill is com-
municated when the lady walks it is only a
sentimental shadow of the emotion Jean
Robertson, the Australian exponent of the
part, aroused when she played it in the
flesh.

A rush of sound that stings and stimu-
lates ; grey twilight effects that hold the sad-
ness of Celtic music intensified a hundred-
fold ; an exalted atmosphere that presses
upon the troubled mind as though not a
congregation but a nation was breaking its
heart in ecstasy before, not high altars, but
crosses high in lone mountain passes; a
frenzied gaiety; an excited, uncivilised soci-
ability—these things startled yet lured the
fancy at the Don Cossacks’ concert on Satur-
day in the Sydney Town Hall. Russia is in
the music these Cossacks interpret, and the
unaccustomed idiom leaves on the ear some-
thing of the tang that wild honey leaves
on the lips. The choir is rich in basses of
a profundity unthinkable, while tenors that
shoot up into the soprano are responsible
for opening effects as soft as the ruffle of
wind among fallen leaves. Through a pro-
gramme that might be classified by a library
expert as religious, domestic (though these
sounded more like the jungle than the hearth)
and military, this remarkable group of men
swung with a sensitive precision of rhythm
and a blending of tone turned off and on by
the merest flip of the hand of Conductor
Serge Jaroff. Of the Funeral Song by
Lwowsky, of its murmurous beginning and
its triumphant swell, a page might be writ-
ten. And the Gloria by Bortnjansky that
sounded to Roman Catholic ears more like
the swell of a Tantum Ergo, created an enor-
mous effect. “On the Road to St. Peters-
burg,” with its background like the roll of
drums, and the familiar “Volga Boatmen”
were other compositions on a memorable
programme.

The bright Lee White show 7 at Sydney
Palace is taking its part in the theatrical-
farewell epidemic. It says what it is hoped
is only an revoir to-morrow; and on Satur-
day “White Cargo” will be delivered.
Amidst a multitude of last nights, “No,
No, Nanette,” keeps brightly on at the St.
James’s with no sign of its own end in sight.
It is now the oldest inhabitant among Syd-
ney shows, but is still young.

“Paddy, the Next Best Thing,” at present.
The mystery of Mile. Leah still keeps
Fullers’ New Theatre audiences guessing;
the simple explanation of the use of a trap-
door is out of court, because the box in which
the lady is subsequently revealed, and which
is pierced in nearly every few inches by
swords, is placed on a frame pedestal which
leaves daylight between it and the floor of
the stage. The Charleston Jazz Sympho-
nists supply a whirring instrumental turn
which causes loud demands for more: and
the Four Little Kellys, one so small that
her bedtime should be before seven, play
stringed instruments so prettily that they
can be forgiven even for “Moonlight and
Roses.” Jim Gerald supplies the usual
hilarious nonsense. Polly McLaren, who
earns several good words for her work in
arranging the ballets for the Gerald shows,
deserves a few more for her own dances —
the one she attaches to the Carnival ballet
this week is a good turn in itself.

Bluett and Mo have got into a better
stride at Sydney Tiv., and gallop through
a good course of laughter to an end which
is still, however, rather wearisome. A comic
satire, “Eucalyptus Baby,” is a tonic to
nerves frazzled by the “Ukulele Baby” mon-
otony. Bright newcomers are the Ngaire and
Tointon xylophonists, and Keith Wilbur
amusingly mimics cats and saxophones and
many other things. The Australian cliam-
pion woodchoppers are back, giving their
turn a fillip of patter; and while they are
on, early trains are forgotten. The sprightly
Dollie and Billie are back again for a couple
of weeks, and Billy Judge’s seal remains to
amaze by his sagacity.

For its new long-distance venture tile Cry-
stal Palace, Sydney, has put on a dual pro-
gramme, a revue supplying an introductory
entertainment to “The Man in the Box” film
in which the pantomimic Syd Chaplin is
at his breeziest. The revue, “Adam and
Eve,” is divided into nine “leaves,” and there
is too great a tendency at pretending to lift
the leaf in some of the sections. Although
it may be doubted whether the performers
are “master artists” the revue will be accept-
able enough with trimming. In “A Regular
Fellow” Hoyt’s have a laughable farce of
the adventures of a prince who becomes a
quick-change artist as he skips from cere :
rnony to ceremony; “The Johnston Flood”
provides thrills for the programme. A homeiy
and intensely pathetic story of an aged ,Tew-
ish couple who, having devoted their iives
to a brilliant son, find themselves despised
by him in his success, is contained in “His
People,’* shown at the Haymarket and
Empress, On Friday (to-morrow) the
Prince Edward lets free “The Wanderer” at
a gala for which there has been booking of
seats for a fortnight.

A Percy Lindsay show: —
Percy Lindsay gets up early to paint his pic-
tures ; and the freshness of the dew of dawn and
the morning bath is over even those representing
other day-periods which are on show at the Mac-
quarie Galleries (Sydney). There is the impression,
too, that Lindsay sits in easy, sober clothes; one
finds no signs here of the freak neckties and fancy
socks in which the art of some painters walks.
“Last of the Blossom” (No. 2) is one of the most
likeable of the exhibition; the mildew of the autumn
atmosphere stands before the purpling background,
with a tree losing its last buds in the foreground.
“Shipbuilders’ Sheds (Berry’s Bay)” (No. 4) shows
a well-conceived foreground against well-lighted dis-
tances ; and some of the smaller pictures are delight-
fu’»—“After Bain” (No. 20) makes you smell the
fresh dampness of the green hill-slope which leads
back to the cottage now bathed in sun. The little
show is a refreshment to the eye.
“THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON,” AT
MELBOURNE KING'S.
Cast away on an island, Butler Bill Crich-
ton begins to play the game, and Lady
Mary Lasenby begins to see stars in his
eyes (Brian Aherne and Mary Hinton).
A strange play is “The Farmer’s Wife,’’
now having a highly successful run at Adel-
aide Royal. A mere anecdote—the whole
plot could be given in one sentence not over-
long—has been expanded into three acts;
there might just as well have been four, for
the hotel landlady, the Farmer’s fourth mat-
rimonial string, is much heard of but not
seen. Whitling, in the lead, gives a fine
performance, but is showing signs of haying
played the part too often. His various
possible wives are all well played, and the
varying shots at a Devonshire accent only
worry an Australian audience in spots.
Among the host of minor characters (at
least six of whom merely cumber the stage)
Graham Stuart and Reginald Newson stand
out. In pictures Syd Chaplin is wildly
funny at West’s; also Viola Dana at the
York, where she rather outdoes the more
boomed Corinne Griffith.
“C. 8.” : C. R. Herschell, who shoots pic-
tures for the Pathe brothers, set out last
week to take a cinema-camera around Aus-
tralia via Broome, Wyndham, Darwin, the
Catherine and the Gulf country. Aeroplanes,
motors, camels and luggers will provide trans-
port.

Poverty
Point
“Flaming Youth” : Nearly £lOOO per foot
—£1011,077 for a 104 ft. frontage—has been
paid for the site of the new Criterion
Theatre which is to go up in place of the
Sydney house of that name when the Park-
street resumptions admit. It is to round
the corner in Castlereagh-street, so Poverty
Point will not have far to move. With it
will go the sort of theatrical agent who books
turns for suburban vaudeville enterprises. He
was generally to be found with his back
against one particular patch of the wall of
the Criterion Hotel, known jestingly as his
"office.” On one occasion a joker pasted a
placard on the spot: “Back here in 10 min-
utes.”
“H.M.” : The stage lost one of its staunch-
est friends among the Australian clergy
when George North Ash crossed the Styx.
Born 77 years ago in England, North Ash
came to Australia in 1884. After two years
at All Saints’, Woollalira, he went to St.
Augustine’s, Neutral Bay, and stayed there
until he retired in 1921. He was chaplain
for many years of the Australian Light
Horse (N.S.W. Lancers), and held the hon-
orary rank of lieut.-colonel. His only son,
Rev. E. A. North Ash, who inherited his
father’s tastes for the drama and music,
has charge of St. Mary’s, Waverley, which
formerly was in the charge of another theat-
rically enthusiastic minister, McKeown. Two
of McKeown’s sons went on the stage, with
full parental approval, and one of them be-
came well known in London.
“Hamfat”: John Brownlee, a Tasmanian
to whom Australia gave an optimistic fare-
well a couple of years ago, has justified the
optimism by securing, a year’s engagement
a | Opera House —the first singer
of British blood to win that distinction. He
starts in October; meantime he is to appear
for a month at Covent Garden.
Ces ’: Mabel Gibson, who comes from
Westralia, is the find of the G. and S. season.
Less than a year ago the pretty blonde was
drawn from the chorus to play a small
comedy part in “The Street Singer.” She
succeeded so well that she got a bigger show
as one of the three sisters in “Lilac Time,”
and from there she was transferred to the
"• ™ S. co. Her first part was Tessa in
Ihe Gondoliers.” Now she has made a hit
r i “The Yeomen of the Guard.”
Mabel passed into the professional ranks
from an amateur co. in Perth.
“Caul-boy”: Ashton .Tarry, the long, thin
actor who talked nothing but Rukh —or
nmses purporting to be such—in “The Green
..m’, css ' ' l:,s an even more congenial part in
"Ihe Bad Man,” the Mexican mess which
G. R. Post is at present offering Melbourne.
As the bandit s batman he maintains dead
silence throughout the play. But his panto-
mime m making love and filling people with
holes- is so expressive that quite a lot of
people haven’t noticed that it is entirely
dumb-show. '
“Curtain-raiser”: The Firm, which is run-
ning 14 separate squads of mummers in
Australia at the moment, is to add another
item to its responsibilities. Percy Grainger
is to pick out some of his own pieces on
Australian keyboards in a concert season
shortly. A critic on the other side remarked
recently that the Melburnian was the one
sunny composer living. This is at once a
tribute to our climate and a commentary on
the taste of Australian audiences, which,
.judging by the programmes they listen to,
have a distinct preference for the gloomy
latioci nations of those Russian composers
who suggest Dostoieffsky and Maxim Gorky
m counterpoint.
Short Circuit” : Fred Esmelton, who used
to storm with Alfred Dainpier and lessor
lights, and who returned to his native land
as member of John D. O’Hara’s first
iughtmn co., is back at the picture busi-
ness in Hollywood. I saw him the other
night as the white-headed millionaire father
in "California Straight Ahead.” He is a
good picture-actor, but, of course, his coun-
try has no use for him in that capacity—
except as an exile.
, ‘‘Short Circuit”: The Ballarat North Golf
Club held a Grand Concert and Queen
Coronation” the other day. I wish I had
gone tor Ive seen the programme, and two
concluding items intrigue me:—
THE QUEENS WILL RETIRE.
GOD SAVE THE KING !
“Hamfat” : Her gaze wandered (50 feet)
to the kewpie on the shelf, symbol of a care-
ts? gaiety that had passed. She glared at
it in anger (another 50 feet
for the glare, every foot of
that intense look revealing
a wild desire to break some-
thing). Then a mist came
in her eyes (10 feet). A
glycerine tear fell, then an-
other and another. At the
fifteenth drop, shown slow-
motion in its full course from
eye to chin, she broke up
completely. The scene
twisted to show the reasons
that bring him back. He
finds her sobbing her little
glycerine-bottle out. He
looks at her smeary face in
amazement (35 feet) ; then
her lips frame the words,
_Why did you come back?”
Ihey frame them three times
while light begins to dawn
upon him. There is no speed
about this light; and I go
out to soothe my nerves by
smoking a cigarette. When
I return dawn has just
broken, and the pair are fall-
ing— slow-motion, with a
final acceleration—into one
another's arms. Thus does
Hollywood spin out a story
that could be read in five
minutes into a film that takes
an hour and a half to screen.
No wonder strong men hog
home-made gin in America.
“Groper”: Perth Play box
►Society has staged for three
nights “The Man-eaters”
(women, of course), by Mar-
chant Flinn, a Westralian
Customs official. Flinn pre-
fers “Eastern” glamor to
Australian realities, and his
play has London and Asia
Minor for locale. It did not
live up to one of the adjec-
tives in the posters, which
described it as “a brilliant
original comedy,” but the
author, undismayed, has
hopes of London.
; 1 met , Jolm Forde in Bourke-
street, Melbourne, the other day. lie is
resting” for the moment, but a few weeks
jj as P la H llg with Renee Kelly in
Daddy Longlegs.” I asked John when
it was that he first started in the theatrical
game, but he was coy. “If I told you, you’d
SUSm*' 1 ? thl^ k I TT was getting quite middle-
aged, _he said. However, he pleaded guilty
,m I’r’y S first Captain Corcoran of
Pmafore that Australia knew and
that was m 1879, so he is really quite grown
up. He has been the original of many rOles
in Australia, including the Mikado in the
opera so named.
“Kir”: Recent attempts of French and
Herman hunger artists” to establish new
tasting records recall a duel fought in Mel-
bourne years ago by Sacco Homan, an Aus-
trian, and a young Scotchman who starved
professionally as “Rex.” An enterprising
showman put the pair in the same glass
house, and began to reap a harvest from a
stieam of morbid individuals who paid six-
‘*4 r! me privilege of walking past
them. After a foodless week the pair began to
disagree violently, and spectators were treated
t?ml« Id th UtburStS iu ? f ? reign tongue. Several
times the manager had to enter the living
th^nen^ l threaten the angry Austrian with
the penalties named in his contract before
it was safe for the Scotchman, of whom
Sacco had become extremely jealous, to go
to sleep. Fearful of an outburst of canni-
balism, the harassed manager rang the tea-
bell and declared the contest a draw at the
end of 35 days.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Madge Titheradge has
registered another very considerable success
by her performance of Beatrice in the New
Theatre production of “Much Ado About
Nothing.” Her fine eye-play and enjoyment
of her own mischief were excellent points.
Henry Ainley as Benedick made a speech
of thanks and referred to the great Beatrice
of Ellen Terry, who occupied one of the
boxes on the first night.
“ Wood’s Green ” : Rimsky-Korsakov’s
opera, “The City of Ivitesh,” has had its
first performance in England through the
medium of the British Broadcasting Co.—
the first time such a thing has ever been
done. But without dramatic action and
appropriate scenery connoisseurs have been
unable to see much in the work to justify its
description as “the Russian ‘Parsifal.’ ” The
story is of the miraculous preservation from
a Tartar invasion of Kitesh, which Bielsky,
the librettist, represents as the Heavenly
City. The performance has led to manj
suggestions for its complete operatic produc-
tion at Covent Garden, especially if George
Pozemkovsky could be secured for the part
of Grisha, which he sang with thrilling
effect for the broadcasting. The beautiful
orchestration was finely treated under the
baton of Albert Coates, who, by the way,
is more than half Russian.
YEARS AND YEARS.
THE DEBI-COLLECTOR: “I promise you I’ll call every week
until you pay up.”
THE ARTIST: "Ah, my dear fellow, this is very touching.
It s years since anybody wanted to make a life-long
friendship with me.”
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : Zangwill is
among the pessimists as tb the position of the
drama in England. Speaking at an O.P.
Club dinner he said:—
The theatre is on its last legs. Owing to dancing,
cinemas and broadcasting, there are not enough
people to fill the playhouses. • Half the London
theatres are kept alive by deadheads. In the pro-
vinces, though the position is financially better, it
is artistmaHy deplorable. Out of 280 productions,
165 were revues. If London has. shaken off its old
subjection to France, it has become the slave of the
olav and the parasite of America.
In repertory theatres and local self-help lies
the chief prospect of salvation, according to
Israel. Also, he suggests, unhopefully, that
the amusement tax levied on so many bad
shows might be used for the establishment
° h a national theatre like the, Comedie Fran-
gaise.
.‘‘Whiteway” (N’York) : Mary Lewis, a
girl who ran away from her home at Little
Kock, Arkansas, seven years ago and put
in an apprenticeship as a chorus-girl at a
Broadway theatre and also did some work
as a minor concert-singer, has come before
Aew York as a fully-equipped prima donna.
b.he has beauty and ambition in equal
measure, and has just been singing Mimi
in La Bohbme” at the Metropolitan Opera
House, where, in addition to a tremendous
ovation from the audience, she secured the
unanimous praise of the leading critics—a
result unequalled since the days of Geraldine
Farrar’s youthful triumph.
“Bris.” : The high moral aims of the movies :
This is Loulou, French, flirtatious, but Married
She loved her husband as only a French girl can
love, but he just took her for Granted. So Loulou,,
like a true-blue Parisienne, engaged in a none-too-
hunnless flirtation with her Music-master.... Then
things started to happen in Earnest!”
Call the thing “Kiss Me Again,” and depict
on the posters a half-naked siren being
hugged on a couch, and if that doesn't fetch
’em nothing will.
“C. Ockney”: Veteran pantomimist
George Lupino, father of a numerous family,
all on the stage, clowned for the last time on
the boards of the Theatre Royal, Birming-
ham, a month or two ago. (He was born,
by the way, in one of the dressing-rooms of
the same house 73 years back.) Son Barry,
of the nimble feet that Australia knows so
well, was harlequin for the occasion.
“F.T.K.” : I remember Rupert Julian (B.
ti/5/’26) for the way lie used to copy Julius
Knight’s clothes. No matter what new attire
Julius would don, out would come Julian a
few days later with a get-up as like it as he
could manage. A time came when this sar-
torial doubling got on Knight’s nerves. After
the first performance of “The Scarlet Pim-
pernel” he said tartly: “Thank God for one
thing, anyway—Julian can’t imitate these
pants in Pitt-street.”
“Flaming Youth”: The lay critic in the
theatre is usually topical as well as down-
right. My. friend Blankly, notoriously poor
at make-up, “doubled” an old man who died
in the first act with a youthful housebreaker
in the third. The entrance of this character
is silent, with “business” intended to be im-
pressive, but the impressiveness was lost
when a voice from the back seats drawled:
“Blime, the old bloke didn’t die—’e took
monkey glands.”
“Nero”: I have a copy of the Sydney
Stage of October 1, 1878. This was a free
sheet giving particulars of the attractions at
the Sydney theatres of the period. On the
date mentioned “OurNativeLand,”a drama by
an unnamed author, was played at the Victoria ;
in the cast were Kate Douglas, W. G. Carey,
Bland Holt, Harry Leston, W. G. Sv’eeney,
T. Ford and Jpe Tolano. At the Royal
were H. G. Byron’s comedy “Old Soldiers,”
and a spectacle, “The Temple of the Sun.”
The star was J. L. Hall, and the support
included Nat Douglas, Myra Kemble, Alice
Deorwyn, J. P. West and Docy Mainwaring.
At the Queen’s were Kelly and Leon’s Min-
strels. Edwin Kelly was the father of
Edwin Lester, now appearing in “Give and
Take.” There were only the three' shows.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The nark who declares
that the work of a conjurer is “only a trick”
is apt to be a nuisance to the theatrical
show also. We arrived in Cockychaff Flat,
where we were billed, to play “The Flight for
Life,” introducing, as the bills said, the
miraculous flying-machine. “I ain’t goin’
to the show to-night,” I heard a bucolic
youth say; “it’s all a schlanter. If the
blokes really ’ad a hairyplane, wot did they
want to come in the train for?”
Art and near-Art in Melbourne:—
The quality of some of Melbourne’s recent shows
of paint suggests that what the city requires is
not more galleries but more sincere artists; never-
theless, the Decoration Co. believes it has perceived
a great public need, and has therefore opened a
spacious and well-lighted salon at 3 ! 50 Little Collins-
street. W. Follen Bishop and Miss Florence Fitz-
Gerald are the housewarmers. For both- these English
artists the book of Nature is mainly leaves. Their
execution is often admirable, but while they are
gravely manicuring their subject the spirit of the
scene eludes them. Two renderings of the Australian
landscape, so unlike the native version as to amount
almost to seditious utterance; should be made the
subject of a patriotic resolution at the. next meeting
of the A.N.A.
Richard G McCann, a young Melburnian who has
been working in Europe, is at present on show at
the Athenaeum. His pigmentations have little of the
mystery of atmosphere, but plenty of the charm
of color artfully arranged. A picture of St. Michael’s
Rock (No. 65) is as rich as Conrad’s prose. His
habit of leaping from one plane to another with the
abruptness of .the mountain goat hardens his outlines,
but he has vision, and by sticking to the highway
of technique should reach the Barnassan pub before
six one of these fine evenings.
Nearly 40 years ago Europe took , the Ballara: , .oy
David Davies from his cowpastures, where he was
painting- Australian sunlight, and poured its influence
into him. The mature results are to be seen in
sombre canvases full of a melancholy beauty now
showing at the Fine Art Gallery-. The Cold World
has evidently been too much for Davies. Here and
there a gleam of watered sunshine travels from these
antipodes and falls on a cottage wall in Wales, but
it only serves to emphasise the brooding sadness
of the scene. There is no cheap sentiment
in his atmosphere, however, and little question of his
power and skill to resolve out of murky chaos, as
in No. 9, something subtly alive. In his water-colors
he pays no very particular attention to perspective,
but is interested in the pattern, and as a result
some of them confuse. A painter’s painter, with a
master’s delight in his medium. The show is the
most important Melbourne has been offered in the
current year.
SISTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
"Twenty London charwomen sat in the circle of
the Seala Theatre recently and saw an adaptation of
Motif-re's comedy ‘The Blue Stockings.’ Around
them were well-known society women; in a box sat
the Queen. But neither in looks nor in dress did
the working women differ greatly from their sisters.
White silk jumpers, furs and cloaks were worn with
easy grace.”
They lolled at their ease in the circle,
Knjoying a feast of Molifre—
A play from the French after work’ll
Provide you a tonic that’s rare!
The Queen to her Lady-in-Waiting
Said; “Where are my sisters that char?
They shouldn’t take much indicating—
Pray show me the seats where they are.”
The Lady-in-Waiting she focused
Her glasses upon the D.C.;
She seemed to be (vulgarly) hocussed,
Bewildered and quite up a tree.
She whispered: “I can’t recognise them
From the rest, if your Majesty please,
For women when dresses disguise them
Resemble a podful of peas.”
And the charwomen, never detected
From their neighbors, the high-stepping lot,
Conceivably may have reflected—
And, again, may have possibly not—
They could claim more than kin sub-cutaneous
With society’s best for a spell;
In their furs and their trappings extraneous
They were sisters outside it as well.

PIANOS (
The Beale Piano is recognised as an instrument of'quality in
almost every walk of life.
Her Majesty, Queen Mary, recently purchased at .Wembley
Exhibition a Beale Piano for Buckingham Palace.
Leading authorities and critics in the musical world, orchestral
directors, educational establishments, statesmen, judges, the
wealthiest of the land, speak in highest praise of the Beale
instrument.
The N.S.W. State Conservatorium of Music—an institute
embracing the best musical experts —in 1924 installed no fewer
than 19 Beale Pianos.
The Presbyterian Ladies Colleges at Pymble, Croydon and
Goulburn, have used Beale Pianos for many years. The princi-
pals have had such entire satisfaction from these instruments
that they have purchased others from time to time as required,
until now there are over 30 Beale Pianos in use.
But beyond all this, the great general public—the final court
of critical judgment have sealed their approval to the extent
of over 60,000 Beale instruments.
Beale Pianos and Player-Pianos are sold on an extended payment plan
that brings them within reach of the most modest income. Liberal
allowances made on used instruments which are accepted in partial
exchange.

STEADY SERVICE SINCE 1917
Severe Test Proves Dependability
Early buyers may have asked themselves —
“Will it last? - ’ but time has proved the
wisdom of their choice.
Delco-Light plants installed early in 1917
are still giving every satisfaction, and, in many
cases, under the most adverse conditions.
Is this not proof of the Sturdiness
and" Dependability of Delco-Light?
You, the buyer of to-day, are purchasing an
article which has stood the supreme test—
the test of time!
This plant is built for the man who is not an
Engineer and lives many miles from the
repair shop.
Simple, Sturdy and Reliable.

Belco-Light features caused much discussion
when the plant was first produced, but time
and service have shown that the ideas of its
designers were sound. The proof is in nearly
a quarter of a million Delco-Lighted homes.
Simplicity is the keynote of Delco-
Light design and the secret of its
dependability.
The engine is of the 4-cycle, air-cooled, A'alve-
in-head type, runs on kerosene, and is direct
connected tq the generator, and is self-
cranking.
The dynamo is a 4-pole shunt wound machine
operating as a compound wound motor when
cranking the engine.
The battery is designed to give years of ser-
vice and is in every case of ample capacity
for its generator.
There are 25 Delco-Light models, one of
which will suit your needs.

“Arthur It.”: Tlic private ’busowners are
"iving Vic. Commissioner Clapp a good run
for his money. The proprietors of one line
have brought in the feminine element to help,
and the smiling attentions of neat khaki-
breeched flappers are attracting customers
from the male-run opposition.
Maoriland is getting tired of the drunken
motorist. Two recent cases were met with
fines of £75 and £lOO and the usual cancella-
tion of licenses, but the Bench, strongly sup-
ported by public opinion, is increasing the
penalties with each offence, and as £lOO is
the maximum fine tile next discouragement
will have to be plain brown jug.
The addition of Russian and Scandinavian
brings the number of languages taught at
Melbourne University to nine. The others
are French, Japanese, Greek. Latin, Spanish,
Dutch and German. After French and Ger-
man, Japanese is the most popular. Twenty-
five Australian heroes are facing the com-
plexities of this lingo, with its three sets of
written characters.
“Jobber” : Another nomination for the long-
arm stakes. Peter Leslie, late of Lerrida
station (Queensland), and in his day one
of the finest rough-riders the Banana State
has produced, was recently knocked down
by a Sydney motorist. On arrival at the
hospital, the driver of the car discovered that
his victim was an old Queensland mate,
whom he hadn't seen for 52 years.
“Sturt”: The Savings Bank of South Aus.
claims to pay the highest interest of any
institution of its kind. It has just declared
the past year’s rate at 4j. continuing that
of the previous year, which was the highest
since the bad old bank-smash days. It
makes just about three-quarters of a million
■sterling to pay out to the small community,
which also holds the record of having a
bigger deposit per head of population than
any other State.
“Petrie”: There is joy in Brisbane, for
the sea-mullet has come home in millions
for the spawning season, choking the tidal
creeks of the south coast with masses of fish.
The shark, the kingfisli, the albatross have
followed, yet without making perceptible im-
pression on the multitude. Fishing is merely
a matter of hauling them in. Southport
fishermen alone despatched 500 cases of
mullet to Brisbane on one Sunday, and next I
day all'the fislishops displayed the sign:
“Deep-sea mullet, 6d. a lb.”
“A. Borig”: Sydney can't be accused of
building its Harbor Bridge without due deli-
beration. I have an old “Australian
Almanac,” dated January 1, IS”S, which con-
tains possibly the first printed reference to
the project. After some remarks about the
necessity for straightening out George-street,
the writer continues :—-
At some future time a bridge . may be thrown,
across from Dawes Battery to the North Shore, so
constructed as to admit of vessels passing beneath it
to the inner harbor. However difficult such an
undertaking may appear to a common observer, to
an engineer, who knows what he may have to contend
with and the means to be employed, these appear
but trifling; particularly since the discovery of the
means of working under water. By the success of
such mi undertaking the value of the land at the
opposite side would increase to an enormous amount;
the various coves might then be connected, and

Euston : The longest non-stop railway run
in Britain is on the Great Western $ on occasions
an express is run through from London to Devon-
port, 227 miles. Time, 244 min. The best regular
figures seem to be the London-Exeter thrice-daily
run of 173 J miles in 180 mm K.V.C.: Can’t offer
any opinion until we see them. But we don’t want
them if they are more than about 3500 words....
Palai: Try us with something much shorter....
Jamesly T.: Much too long. And a bit late, into the
bargain... .8.W.H.: Thank you. The Woman's
Mirror would be glad to hear about that lady....
1825: No, but there is something to be said in favor
of revising premium rates on without-profit life-
insurance policies, including immediate annuities,
because of the extra interest earnings nowadays....
Q.P.: That small crop has been already well harvested.
.... Bellerive: There is nothing like a really homely
theme. Never before has the creature had its due
in verse :—-
Like the daring fleas—
They’re a notorious pest—
Are loathsome bugs which
In old houses nest.
In worn ceilings and walls
They thickly abound,
To revel they assemble
And prowleth around.
In a lodging-house bed
One sultry night
I was tortured by bugs
With diabolical might.
When I told the keeper
He replied: “Be a swell
And rent a room at
The Grand Hotel.”
.. . . Byron C.: It is bad in form and fails to carry its
meaning.... H.M.W.: It makes rather a small noise.
... . S.M. (Wellington) : Not very bright. .. .D.M.K.:
The lines are not bad; see if you can’t make them a
bit less loose and ragged... .L.G.J.D.: Merely wild
prose chopped into stove lengths.... Ivookaroo: The
verse shows little skill and has less point... .L.J.G.:
Rather wooden commonplaces. .. .J.H.L.: Very bad.
. ...C.V.R.: Not convincing, and not particularly
interesting either.... G. A. 8.: Too obviously manu-
factured out-of the conventional material.... A.A.G.:
The mirth, if any, lies in the yarn, not in the long-
drawn-out conversations, which are tedious. . . .P.T.0.:
Pleasant in its way, but treads old ground and does
not do it with a very springy step.... G.E.C.: Why
not send it to the girl? She might lack an ear
for rhythm. . . .E.E.M.: Not up. . . .H.8.T.: The yarn
is not quite t01d... .R.F.S.: You don’t get it... .
L. : We note that “you never tired, only felt
inspired,” in a continuous singing of the Old bull
songs. We have heard some of you, but generally
fell asleep or went insane at stanza 493... .Margaret
M. : The verse bumps along heavily saying the old
things... i Country Woman: They, fall short in
manner, and the matter isn’t as interesting as you
ought to be able-to get.... Jelly C.: Stick to your
own little subjects. Everyone knows some thing better
than everybody else; and that’s the thing we want
to hear from him about.... G.WAV.: Some distance
off the target. .. .T.C.G.: All the jingles fail to help
it when you try to rhyme “sport” with “ought”
and “Clarinda” with “hinder”... .Peggy P.: It
hasn’t enough interest even for a shocking example.
. . . .I’.D.D.: Don’t care for it. . . .R.T.M.: The crafts-
manship fails rather badly.... J.R.P.: An old theme
with nothing fresh in the handling.... Alex. S.:
We don't want parodies. “Inspiration” gets- to
nothing. .. . Z.V.W.: The yarn doesn’t carry us away.
. ...D.S. (Fitzroy) : A thin, unhappy yarn without
interest. .. .Ada M.: Poor, little, weary old tale....
J.A.K.: Not particularly mirthful.... A.E.P.: Wild
stuff that has a very young look. . . .McC.R.: Not up.
. ...A.H. (Warwick): Don’t care for it....R.8.
(Henley Beach): Not bad, but no use to u 5....
A.R.W.: Noisy stuff that staggers about in an
intoxicated fashion. .. . Wilga : Misses. . . .0.M.K.:
Shows promise, but does not cry for print.... Emel:
None of them arrive, though all are somewhere on
the road. . . .E.D. (Perth) : The lions ai'e not vigorous
beasts... .M.J.M.: No use here. .. .George M.: Weak
and thin....N.W. (Milton): Can’t imagine by what
mental process you arrived at the idea that it was
verse. .. .8.W.C.: Its jerks, its scarcity of rhymes
and the insignificance of its ideas rather spoil it. . . .
A.8.D.P.: Doesn’t make us want to print it....
S.II. (Jandowae) : No yarn there... .H.G.8.: Not
for this market. .. .E.W. (Woy Woy) : A very im-
probable bit of melodrama.... E. ALE.: The tolerance
article hasn’t much appeal... .H.R.M.: The professor
leaves us very c01d....C.V. (North Sydney): Not
for us. .. .Ripponlea: The attack on the wild animal
in hexameters has its points:—
The window faced east, and was draped with a
remnant of curtain,
Warm and appealing, bathed in the flood of the
afternoon sunshine.
A blowfly stood basking, massaging his eyes and
his ears with his back legs,
Then buzzing around and around and looping the
loop with great vigor.
Mrs. Joans came in with the fly-whacker hid ’neatli
the folds of her apron.
On her face was a grim and determined expression.
She strolled round the bedroom,
Assuming nonchalance, but e,yeing the insect ob-
liquely.
Approaching the window, she launched an attack at
the blowfly:
She lifted her arm with a jerk and the whacker de-
scribed a half-circle,
But failed to connect and got sadly ensnared in the
lace of the curtain.
Wrenching it free with some oaths that she’d pre-
viously learnt from her husband,
She walloped again with much force at the spot
where the blowfly was standing ;
And wouldn’t of missed except that the fly was
alert and so agile
And possessed of a frenzy now that he saw her
intention.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.S.R.: Fire proceeding from the nostrils is
allowed only to dragons... .U.D.: We remain unper-
turbed at Rene’s infidelity... .N.AAV.: Motor horse-
power joke can’t sing its swan song in our pink
kimono E.V.N.: The steeplejack who does not
envy the other fellow liis terrible risks is a hoary
patriarch.... R.R.: Drawing squeaks at the joints,
and the joke has served its day. .. . A.H.T.: The
salesman who could sell the distorted automobile in
the background would be the king of magsmen....
L.L.: The joke is a prize exhibit in our museum
J.T.H.: Strongly suspect that you are the virtuous
young man who steadfastly refuses to look at a
life model.

Coot : The Maryborough (Vie.) City
Council lias taken a hint from the pushing
lank. It recently bought from the Govern*
ment 100 acres of Crown land within its
borders, and is offering the whole or part of
the area to any body or company that will
establish factories to employ local labor.

“XSA”: Suburban kitchen-orchards will
shortly come under the provisions of the
limit Diseases Act—if the N.S.W, State
Advisory Board' has its way. This means
registration, even if only one fruit-tree is
grown. The Smiths, of Roseville, will no
uoubt make a noise, but compulsory and
effective treatment for pests and diseases
viJi protect them against more inefficient
or lazier neighbors*, and where fruit-trees are
concerned there seems always to be some-
body lazier and more careless than you are
yourself.

Strict \ eg. : Houses made of kerosene-
t'J familiar spectacles in certain parts

Melbourne man to start erecting one in a
classy suburb alongside a £5OOO palace.
\\ hen the Council heard of the contemplated
desecration it reared, but on being shown
ways as well as means came to earth and
allowed building to proceed. Three thousand
new tins will be employed, and the whole is
~i ,e co . i !| e ! l with cement. The completed
edifice will be worth £2OOO, according to its
progenitor.

Settlements^ 6 * British possession—Straits
‘Black Tracker”: Twelve years ago a
young Scotch nurseryman landed in Adelaide
As there was no suitable work offering, he
took on a job on a mixed farm in the hills.
Un tins farm was a block of about 50 acres
r ®a Wl th dog-rose briars, locally regarded
as a pest. Hie far-seeing Scotchman thought
otherwise, and when lie learned that the
block could be bought for £lOO he set to work
and raised the money from friends, at home;
The neighbors smiled then, but they don’t
now. Ihose briars to-day are bringing £6
a thousand on the ground. As most of the
rosji-grbwers in the Eastern States draw
thmr supplies from South Aus., the demand
is greater than the supply. Recently Sanely
received a single order for 120,000 briars,
cash on delivery.
i. * * * *
~ ar . s : y isn’t only in Melbourne that
the Thieves Union is forgetting onh Of its
traditional obligations (B. 6/5/’26). Dur-
ing the absence from his room of one of the
pai tners of an Adelaida legal firm an un-
known blew m and helped himself to £2OOO
worth of bearer bonds. Calmly walking
through the outer offices in full view of the
ciei-ks, who evidently imagined him to be
a departing client, he disappeared. A few
days later another —or, more likely, the same
marauder walked boldly into the offices
or another legal firm, and, going straight
to the strong-room, helped himself to a roll
ot notes. Interrupted by a typist, he cour-
teously raised his hat and, bidding her the
time of day, melted away. There is a sus-
picion that he was once a party in a defended
divorce suit, and is taking direct action to
recover some of his costs.
* * * *
Bqrom”: A quaint and lucrative busi-
ness in Sydney and Melbourne is that of
restoring stolen property to its owners when
“If, a rl to pay. Mostly the
!>old watch lifted by a pickpocket or looted
Y a housebreaker rapidly finds its way to
the fence and the melting-pot. But some-
times it happens that the watch is a presen-
tation-.one, and it is likely that the owner
Wlll be prepared to pay much more for its
recovery than any fence will give for it
in such cases the services of the go-between
are availed of to “work back” the plunder
Aot long ago a Sydney alderman was robbed
ot a valuable engraved watch while travelling
oy the Melbourne express. Knowing the
lopes, he left the police alone, looked up an
underworld acquaintance and commissioned
him to do lus best. Within 24 hours he had
las property back again at a cost of £2O.
winch was twice as much as any receiver
would have been likely to pay for it. A
well-known solicitor still tells how he was
approached one to see what he
would give for some silver plate plundered
Horn Ins house, the same 'morning- the
request was the first intimation he had that
the stuff was gone.
Two .Seas : I gnash my teeth at this
statement made by “Rex” (B. 15/4/’26) :
Almost daily solicitors encounter cases of land-
agents helping themselves to a few hundred pounds
ot commission for a few hours’ gassing, while the
„ a "-!’ er * ets o]ll -Y a couple of guineas for the laborious
voik of preparing the documents and title deeds.
Ao doubt land-agents do rake off too much
tor then- services, particularly those who
appear before Band Boards and collect big
tees for remarking “I appear for the appli-
cant the application often being a mere
matter of form that the cocky could easily
put through himself if he could speak up in
court like lie does when he is getting the
milkers out of bed in the dark. But lawyers
arein no way behind land-agents in adding
to the high cost of land. I have had a fairly
wide experience in buying and selling land,
hut have never had the luck to strike one
or the tribe who asked only a couple of
guineas for the laborious work of preparing
be documents and title deeds.” One may
my or sell £lO,OOO worth of stock without
£2o lg f a i la y yei m, lllto * he <lea1 ’ "el an
acu of land. There is no reason that I
can 5,. ( . why it should not be as simple to
buy or sell mud as bullocks. The power and
tw « • •>"' kf ? al uniou in safeguarding
fmi Pn m « gfiS ls the only obstacle. It is
tune the Government recognised that the
iuSoJTVV-’T 1 is ‘ t 0 « extent,
caubed by tlic high price of law.

REVOLUTION in SHAVING!
Old Ways Rubbing
Soap made with Soda
into skin
NO SOAP! NO BRUSH!
Why the Shavex Way has come to stay
ShaveX
a
New Way:
Smear lightly
over face
Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer? Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVEX,
the natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look
twice as young. No after lotions are
required when using Shavex, for it is a
skin food as well.

MAIL TO DESK “S.B ”
Senator Grant lias established one record.
A delegate to the Sydney Trades and Labor
Council, representing the Stonemasons’
Union, before the Parliamentary Labor
party arrived, be has been deputed by his
union to look after its interests at every
X.S.W. Labor Conference to date.
T. 0.1.": Bertram Mackennal is not
the first sculptor who was commissioned to
execute an. Australian memorial to W. Sliaks-
peare. In 1805 Charles Summers (who lias
to his credit the Burke and Wills statue,
which, by the way, I saw cast) made a
plaster model of Sliakspeare seated in a
chair, and a committee headed by Frederick
Wilkinson, Master in Equity, tried to raise
funds to have it done in bronze. The
plaster effigy was placed on the top of the
steps leading to the Public Library, and was
formally unveiled by Barry Sullivan, but
it never got beyond plaster.
The business which Riley Brothers sold
last month to a Pitt-street (Sydney) firm
on account of their premises being resumed
by the Government for the city railway was
started on Brickfield Hill about GO years
ago by Alban J. Riley, who was later joined
by his brother Philip. Branches were
opened at Oxford-street and West Maitland
(under the supervision of a third brother,
John) ; also at Queanbeyan and Newcastle.
The brothers were noted for their strong
attachment to one another. None of the
sons took kindly to the business, preferring
banking, medicine or sheep-raising.
“Hobnobster”: Civil servants rarely
trouble to search for the soft answer that
turneth away wrath, but a clerk in the
Tramway Department whose job is to inves-
tigate the complaints of travellers is a not-
able exception. The other day' a soldier,
bent on picking a quarrel with someone in
authority, lurched to the counter where they
issue the soldiers’ free passes, and demanded
with a hiccough: “Are you the who in-
sulted my wife the other day?” Quick as
a flash came the disarming reply, “Me, Dig.?
Why, I’m the clerk who holds the babies for
’em.” The aggrieved face cleared instan-
taneously. “Are you?” was the hearty re-
sponse, “Put it here, then; you’re a blanky
white man.”
St. Anne’s, liyde (N.S.W.), will have its
centenary in August; it was a year old
before the marriage register was set going
with the union of William Pollard and
Susannah Reardon. The pretty, creeper-
covered church is surrounded by a long-filled
God’s-acre in whose memorials the names of
some noted pioneers are preserved—Major
Edward Darvall; the children of explorer
Blaxland, whose home was Brush Farm ; Dr.
Thomas Forster, surgeon of the 46th Regi-
ment ; the Rouses, the Terrys, the Mannings,
and George Minto, wdio, on retirement from
the India Co.’s service, came to Australia
and gave his name to a township near Camp-
belltown. Among others whom the church-
yard holds are the wife of explorer Oxley
and the second wife of Henry Parkes; and
the most recent tablet in the church brings
in the Big War —it is to the memory of
Major Leonard Banfield, killed on Gallipoli
August 22. 1915.
“Copabeiia”: Few of the youngsters at
Queensland State schools are old enough
to have known any Government except a
Labor one. Hence it was not surprising
at the recent State scholarship examinations,
when students were asked to say in eight
lines what they knew of Henry Ford, to find
one bright lad summing up the subject of
the inquiry as a “very nice man who never
failed to write to people when they were in
trouble or wanted anything; and that is how
they send him to Parliament every time.”
The only Ford(e) of which the child had
heard was Frank, M.H.R., the most inde-
fatigable correspondent in the Federal Par-
liament. In the same scholarship examina-
tion, however, Nationalism got some of its
own. The subject was “The March of the
Cameron Men,” and to a query as to who
the marchers were one enterprising youth
opined that “they would be supporters of the
member for Brisbane (Col. Cameron), whose
popularity is not confined to his own party.”
“Moreton”: Until quite recently it was
the practice in Queensland to hold post-
mortem examinations in all cases of sudden
death where a medical certificate was not
given, even when the cause of death was
obvious. On one occasion a police officer
was hauled over the coals for burying a man
whose head had been almost cut off by a
train, instead of holding the corpse for a
post-mortem. Relatives of the deceased in
such cases were charged with the cost of
the p.m., and it was customary to send a
policeman to collect the fee, the corpse being
held as security. One officer, who strongly
disliked the job, told the dunned relative :
“If I were in your place, and you came to
me asking me-to pay for the cutting up of my
son’s body, I would tell you to go to Hell.”
“Well, Sergeant,” said the other, “you can
consider it said.” The sergeant reported that
the account could not be collected. On the
facts being brought to the notice of Home
Secretary Stopford. he gave instructions that
the practice of employing the police to collect
the fees was to be discontinued at once.
For years doctors have been a regular
item of export, and many of them are at the
top of the tree in England. Professor
Elliot Smith is its greatest authority on the
anatomy of the brain. Dr. Dun hill (Guy’s)
lias a great reputation for goitre operations;
Sick Britons feel privileged to get into the
private hospital of Douglas Shields. The
Prof, of Anatomy at Cambridge is J. T.
Wilson, who was at Sydney. Ada Cross-
ley’s husband. Dr. Muecke, is a nose and
throat specialist; and Dr. Bedford Russell
(Bartholomew’s) is prominent in the same
field. The list includes also Levick (St.
George’s), John Anderson, Milligan (Croy-
don)', Kendall (R.M.0., London), Joe Cun-
ning (who wrote “Aid to Surgery”), Esnie
Anderson (West London), Dennis Brown
(Great Ormond-street), Paddy Moran (West
London), Norman Haire (gynaecologist),
M. V. Brown (London), ,T. E. Wigley (skin
specialist). Francis (in Henrietta-street for
20 years), Beale, Isaac Jones (St.
Thomas’s), A. W. L. Row (Bart’s). Perry
(London) and Ellingworth, who worked his
passage as a seaman to London, after gain-
ing his Mojbonrne degree five years ago, and
is now superintendent of West London
Hospital. A Rhodes scholarship sent Dr.
L. G. Brown, of Brisbane, who is winning
lame as an ear, nose and throat specialist.

Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
Of all tlie new discoveries in medical science the most remarkable of recent
years is one which has proved invaluable to thousands of people and which is
rapidly taking the place of all other remedies for the relief of coughs and colds.
This preparation is called Dr. Sheldon's New Discovery for Coughs and Colds,
and is a scientific compound of great merit. It is most healing to the lungs
and throat, and stops the cough or cold in a remarkably short time, leaving no
bad after-effects.
A few doses of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, taken when a cold is coming
on, are generally all that is needed to soothe the fever and correct the bodily
discomfort of a severe cold. It is well to continue taking New Discovery for a
da. or two even after the attack seems averted, for its soothing influence on the
mucous membrane renders one less liable to a second attack.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a favorite Cough Remedy for men, women
and children. It will protect you this winter from any tendency to Bronchitis,
from having a bad Cold in the head and from Influenza. There is nothing better
than New Discovery to prevent or relieve the children in an attack of Croup
and Whooping Cough.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is Australia’s National Remedy and is good
for all the family.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHAT strange gods from what firma-
ments afar .
Have sent their agents and then-
sample creeds
To make this world a wrangling, vast
bazaar —
A chattering market-place, where false-
hood pleads,
Where faiths are vended, guaranteed to be
The very raiment that the nude soul needs,
Where fear may lease the parks of para-
dise
For such and such a fee
Or purchase at a special bargain-price
Totems and passports for eternity?
And man, still, jostling in that market-place,
Cashes the current virtues of his mind,
Gambles his golden prayers.for plots of space
The title-deeds whereof remain unsigned.
He haggles over love with eyes that gleam
And glare a hatred on his fellow-kind,
When he might splendidly, a light-heart
boy,
Bathe in the living stream
Of laughter bubbling from the hills of
joy
And gallop bareback on the plains of dream!
Gallop in clean intoxicating air,
Joyously breathe the breezes of the day,
Toss old timidities aside and fare
Singing along the great adventure-way,
Challenge the fates themselves and, right or
wrong.
Judge and assess them as an equal may,
Ready to meet them face to face when
death
Shall pass the word along,
Eager to live until his last hot breath,
Ready to die to merriment and song!
Daring to circulate the coin of life
And chance the debit-note that death may
bring,
Keen for all friendliness and bold for strife,
And, like a clean sunlover, free to sing
Carols to morning and delirious noon
And sudden night and unafraid to fling
His laughters where the superstitions
frown,
Or shout a ribald tune
In mental catacombs where fears deep
down
Crouch from the candors of the sun and
moon!
Daring to see the sacredness of earth,
Decking his dreams in wattle-bloom and
star.
Greeting adversities with smiling mirth.
And fearing not what jeopardies might
mar
The strong glide forward on the rainbow-
bright
Crest of the breakers where the big seas
are —
The strong glide forward on the boom-
ing seas
Of life’s unmeasured might—
And loving love and all the mysteries
Of love’s mad immemorial delight!
True to the surge of life and life’s wide way,
Down the dark past what carven crea-
tures go !
Those deified grotesques have had their day;
Their laws are monstrous and their trade
is woe.
Leave them and all their merchandise of sky
And pay due tribute to the truths we
know —
To love and beauty and the laughter-
sense
And honor and the high
Courage and clean, divine irreverence
Of men who dare to live and dare to die!
N.S.W.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
The Terrible Alternative.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
VERYWHERE on the island the
i frightful thing was being discussed
* -—Bruce Farley had accepted the ter-
rible alternative.
It was true he could change his mind at
the eleventh hour. Indeed, it was likely
that he would, after a visit to the leper
settlement; for if his choice had been made
in the hope of cheating death, the sight of
those breathing corpses would convince him
of the futility of escape.
Why had he made this fearful choice? Was
it, he asked himself, the natural struggle
of a healthy man against dissolution, or was
he subconsciously hoping that the one chance
in a million against infection might be his?
To him, whose actions and words were be-
yond reproach, it seemed incredible that
his denial should be impugned. He had
made his statement simply and clearly. He
had gone to Brodney’s house to thrash him
for an act of unpardonable familiarity to-
ward an honorable lady, and having chas-
tised the scoundrel he had left and was on
his why back to the hotel when he heard
shots. Thinking that they were meant for
him, and had missed, he did not return to
investigate. He could not account for his
revolver being in Brodney’s house; so far
as he knew it was in the drawer of his table
at the hotel when he had set out.
The import of the verdict he did not at
once realise. It was not until the fatal pro-
nouncement that the awful significance of
the sentence filtered into his numb brain,
the full realisation coming in an almost im-
personal way with the Judge’s concluding
remarks: “By an act of law prisoners con-
demned to death have an alternative —they
may submit themselves for inoculation in the
interests of medical science.”
His memory of the fearful moment was
of a death-like stillness in the crowded court
and of an illusion that the Judge was part
of peculiar shadowings which the sunhght
made on the wall behind him. A face in the
Sense crowd had flashed before him seeming
unreal, almost spectral, yet possessing the
familiar features of a person he knew
Clieon, the Chinese waiter, whose exquisitely
sensitive hands reminded him strangely of
those of the famous surgeon to whom he
owed his own life and on whose advice he
had come to Honolulu to recuperate.
Amongst so many it was strange that one
face should hold him, while those others
somehow seemed but a breathing conglomera-
tion.
The dawn found his sensibilities reassert-
ing themselves, but the full horror of his
situation was borne in on him by his en-
virons rather than by an explicable sensa-
tion of coming annihilation. He wondered
how it was that he could not dwell on his
predicament, and that irrelevant scenes and
snatches of conversation should so vividly
and startlingly obtrude.
It wms Saturday, and, as was customary
on that day, Honolulu was en fete. He
imagined he heard the vociferous fruit-
sellers with-their piles of oranges and guavas,
strawberries and papayas and bananas,
pressing their goods upon promonaders along
street and beach ; he visioned the coral ven-
dors intercepting the unwary ; the beautiful
native maidens casting shy glances abroad ;
the Polynesians, the negroes and the bland
and hairless-faced Chinese —all mingling in
happy abandonment.
He had been a unit of that life out there,
but already he was apart from it. In the
space of a few hours lie had begun to look
on it impersonally. Had hope been anni-
hilated that he could thus calmly and in-
differently view the fearful outlook?
Into his cogitations flashed the thought
of Clieon. A startling apparition of him
came and went. What would he, with las
contempt for death honorably met, do in
Farley’s place? Meet the executioner with
that inscrutable smile of his or take up las
abode with the lepers in the charnel-house?
He was not surprised wdien the door of his
cell opened to perceive that the warder was
admitting the man vdio so persistently
haunted him.
Without preamble Cheon began. “Is it
true that you give yourself for experimenta-
tion?” Farley assented.
“You will go to the compound and see to
what you doom yourself? It is your right,
and you will be wise to avail yourself of it.
“I go to-morrow.”
“You will cheat one executioner, but en-
counter many. The one is quick, merciful
—so! and you are beyond feeling. But the
many —-ah, they are not merciful to one so
fastidious, so sensitive as you ! After the
prick of their needle they will guard you
zealously; they will take yOur temperature,
they will test your blood and make you eat
■of native food and vary it with a Western
diet. The death that is soon over is more
merciful.”
“I am not a felon, so shall not die lik<'
one.”
“Ah. so, that is your pride! But what
matter when one has no further use for
pride —what matter how one die? Is no*
death inevitable? It will come sometime tc
everyone; then is it not good if it come
swift —so! —and then be over for ever? The
slow way for you—no! You must be saved
from your folly. Wee Ing, my countryman,
he gave himself to the doctor; They are
puzzled—Wee lug will not contract the foul
disease. They wait, but no signs will come.
Now they say they will prick their needle
into him once more. It is not just. He has
once accepted the alternative, but they will
not let him go. Why? Wee Ing is a poor
man. No man of law 7 will defend a poor
man, so his life is of no worth but to the
doctor, who will prick and prick till the
leprosy make the fatal signs in his eyes, on
his skin. But vou -are not a poor man. They
will prick once, so! and let you go if you
come through clean. You they may pity and
experiment upon with some harmless vaccine,
though it is not well to trust your medical
scientist when he sits on his hobby-horse.
Life to him is a means to his end. He will
make a hundred clean, but he must first
have one life to do with as he will. Wee
Ing will satisfy for a little, then must come
another —you! But you, you also must be
saved from your folly. All around me is
talk of you, all day they talk of you; but,
do they come and talk to you? Wee Ing
is a poor man, so the law will keep from him
those who, like myself, would lighten his
tedium with a little converse. The gaoler
is making signs. Farewell! I grieve at the
loss of you. I will greet you to-morrow when
you pass on your way to the charnel-
house.”
So they talked of him. What did they
say? Cheon had been discreetly silent on
that point, but his l)o they come and talk
to you?” was powerfully revealing. Why had
Cheon come? Why had he dragged in Wee
lug’s hateful case? “You must be saved
from your folly.” What did he mean. What
had been hidden in that inscrutable srmle ot
his. in the deep, fathomless eyes? Wee ing
will not contract the foul disease... . ton
also must be saved from you folly. What
connection was there between Wee Ing and
Bruce Farley?
Had Cheon planned to save him? But
how? He was nothing to this cultured
Chinese but a specimen of a despised race.
Let him put Cheon aside and face the facts
clearly. He was a condemned man. He
would not be tricked by hope. He was a
dead man, and in another week would enter
his tomb. Nothing could save him, nothing.
Next day he went forth to inspect lus
tomb. Everywhere, on the way, the spirit
of gaiety rnled. But the scenes woke no
longing in him—he was dead. He would
never again pulsate to the song of life, never
again stand awed and dumb in the presence
of beauty. All feeling, all joy, all desire
had gone out with the death of hope.
One of his warders stopped outside the
hotel to procure some water, and Farley
sensed the curious glances of onlookers m
concealment behind the flaming bougainvillaea
that festooned the cool verandah. Only
Cheon showed himself, immaculate and in-
scrutable, waving his beautiful hands in
silent farewell.

He wondered whether, if freedom sud-
denly came to him, he would thrill anew at
the loveliness about him, loveliness that had
never failed to move him to the depths of liis
being. But he knew he was still alive
when the long wards of the compound hove
in sight. Then cold sweat broke on him.
For the fraction of a moment he halted, his
body swayed, his eyes closed as though lie
would shut out the horrible picture; then
he went forward through the gates into the
living tomb.
The warders left him in the care of the
ministering sisters and the heroic men who
had turned their backs upon the world to
devote their lives to the wretched sufferers
within whose breasts hope still burned.
“Do you wish to go through the entire
building V”
He looked into the pitying eyes of the
sister who had turned with a rare smile to
put the question.
“If you please.”
She led the way into a bare, sunlit ward.
The beds were empty, and he blessed her
thoughtfulness. He understood. The patients,
some of whom he saw on the verandah, were
in the first stages of leprosy, They smiled
at the sister, then looked at him, a mute
question in their eyes. Some, sensitive to
the gaze of a stranger, had run and hidden
in the garden. One, a beautiful half-white
child, came timidly to his side, drawn by
the pity in his voice and eyes. He stooped
to take the mite in his arms, but the vigi-
lant sister intervened. “You are not yet
one of us.”
He looked at the hungry-eyed child, saw
her shrinking backward movement as the
sister held him off, noted the wistful drop of
her month and the look of pain that crept
into the blue eyes.
“I may be your friend in a few days, little
one.”
She clapped her hands delightedly, uncon-
scious of his meaning.
“Sister, how do you endure the agony of
all this?”
“They love me.”
The sister paused at the narrow corridor
leading to the hospital. “This ward will In'
a severe trial, Mr. Farley. Would you pre-
fer not to go in?”
“I shall see it through.”
“I wish I could help you. The sights are
terrible.”
“You suffer them daily.”
“God has blinded my eyes to their hideous
bodies and lets me sec only their poor,
timid souls.”
“I shall strive, then, to see them through
your eyes,” and holding the door he followed
after her into the long ward flooded with
brilliant sunlight that played mercilessly
upon ghastly faces.
At the far end a dying man was auction-
ing his worldly belongings a poor little
heap of clothes, a few trinkets and a
tobacco-bag. The dreadful, rasping voice
rose and fell, and shrilled when the bag fell
to his neighbor’s bid. The tragic excitement
of the pitiful bargaining had roused his
sluggish blood for the moment to a show
of life that flared up in the ulcerous body
and made his grasp upon the treasured hoard
tight and greedy as a miser’s.
Farley paused, and with slow deliberation
surveyed the ghastly drama. All that slowly-
rotting flesh had somewhere behind it the
semblance of a man ; a mind to think, power
to suffer, energy to act, will to live and
heart to hope.
He turned to the sister. “What happens
when they lose hope?”
"Life is hope; only death can kill it.”
“But this is death.”
“All who come and look on it say so, but
the poor creatures themselves do not see
it that way. They’ll have the same feelings
when Peter is carried out as you would at
the death of a loved friend.”
He was incredulous. “They want to live?”
“The fewest number pray to die.”
He was nauseated with the sights. A
shuddering seized him. Could he—dare he,
face this terrible thing? What mattered if
he chose the merciful end, the felon’s end?
Some time reparation would be made and
his name be cleared. Chcon was right. He
would save himself from his folly. He could
not risk this fearful martyrdom: it would
kill his reason, and, his reason killed, there
would be no heroism in his choice.
The sister touched him gently. “Come
away; it has been too much for you.”
He looked at her and read the pity in
her eyes, saw the Quivering of her tender
lips ere she strove to hide her emotion behind
her spread hands.
“I may not dare to face it.” he said, divin-
ing the reason of her agitation.
“I pray God will spare you.”
He followed her out into the garden,
where his gaolers waited to escort him back
to prison.
“Good-bye, Mr. Farley.”
“Good-bye, Sister.”
Evening was at hand. The sound of
happy laughter mingling with song came up
from the valley, but laughter and mirth and
life called in vain to Farley. The air in
the cell was foetid. The glare of the lamp,
shining through the barred door, played
tricks with his over-wrought nerves. A
ghastly procession of lepers in all stages of
their loathsome disease seemed to pace his
cell and move out into the corridor, where
they stood between him and the light. A
horrible fear crept over him as one amongst
that spectral group stepped forward, its gro-
tesque head like a huge potato, with no
eyes distinguishable, nor nose nor mouth.
Great God! Would he change to that! Un-
consciously his hands went up to his head,
slowly he felt his face, his neck, and in the
awful nightmare of his overstrained state
he imagined that his features were changing,
were becoming indistinguishable. He fought
desperately against his maddening thoughts,
lie clung to the bars of the door, and, con-
centrating on the light, strove with all his
reason to master the terrible thing that was
oppressing him.
Was there not the speedy way out? After
all. what did it matter? He could face it
with a clear conscience, meet it bravely in
the knowledge of his innocence. That other,
that living death spent in association witli
other rotting flesh, how could he go through
with ii and retain his reason? No, it was
impossible. He would go out the felon’s
way. Better his body should burn in a bed
of quicklime than rot slowly before the eyes
of his fellow's.
But the ghosts peopling the night slunk
awrny at the first pale gleam of dawn, and a
fresh mood took possession of him. To die
the death of a felon was to admit himself a
felon. The crueller death demanded the
greater courage. He must prove that he
was no weakling, no coward. lie w'ould go
through with it, would record daily for the
benefit of his executioners the various sensa-
tions as the disease progressed. A strange
exultation seized him. He was a martyr,
a fanatic rejoicing in the trial about to be
made of his body.
The day long he hugged this mood, but
with the deep silence of night the revolting
train came forth anew, more hideous, more
terrible after their brief banishment. But
now the thing with the misshapen head
failed to horrify, for in its arms, that still
retained a semblance of shapeliness, was a
fair half-white child who smiled on him
and in the next moment had turned away
and clasped with her frail arms the repulsive
horror that bent its terrible head to rest
on her fair curls.
He recalled the nausea he had experienced
when his eyes first fell on those grotesque
features, and the softly-spoken words of the
sister. “She is greatly loved ; her husband
is devoted to her. He has given up his
life outside that he may be always near her.”
Ilis own comment had been tinged with
bitter cynicism. “How cruelly he must have
wronged her in some other life to love her
so idolatrously in this.” Her gently-spoken
rebuke had chastened his bitterness: “He
sees what he loves behind that terrible mask.
It is herself he loves.”
Recalling her fortitude in that house of
death, lie was re-charged with courage to
keep faith with his honorable pride. He
had suffered in these awful hours the long
years of living death that faced, him; he
had witnessed a man's unfailing devotion ;
had been moved to his utmost depths by
the hungry desolation and loneliness in a
child's eyes. The fearful -struggle was be-
hind him. lie no longer encouraged the
lamp of hope to light the dark places in his
soul. Others before him had worn away, the
sharp- edges of the stones that paved the
road he must henceforth traverse. True,
he would stumble along, but he would leave
no bloody footprints. What had boon en-
dured could be endured, and there was always
the Kindly Stranger at the end of the road.
The chaplain came and talked to him of
the mercy of God. of the lusts and passions
of the flesh, and of the black sin of homi-
cide.
Farley listened impassively to the mono-
tonous voice, closing his eyqs against the
sight of the moving lips that opened and shut
with mechanical regularity.
“Is C-heon still at the hotel?” He put
the question with startling suddenness.
“No : he disappeared some days ago.”
Farley drew a sharp breath, a sickening
fear oppressed him. Despite his calm and
apparent indifference to his fate there had
been, deep down in him, a belief that Cheon’s
words had been charged with meaning, that
his “You must be saved from your folly”
meant that he, Cheon, would deliver him
from the grave. He had been unconscious
of it. but it had been there. He knew now
that back of the looming horror the words
had lulled him to a sense of security, of im-
munity from his impending fate. And Cheon
had cleared out! Ilis mind was too dulled
to realise the irony of the situation or to
take in the chaplain’s words as he knelt
imploring Almighty God to chasten the spirit
of this hardened sinner and bring him to a
realisation of his need of penitence and
humility.
Night again brought the grim spectres,
and amongst them Cheon, a saturnine smile
on his thin, parted lips and the inscruta-
bility of the Sphinx in his dark, unfathom-
able eyes.
“Why do I think of him? His words
meant nothing, and the day after to-morrow
is the end.”
The thought brought a certain relief. It
was as if he had been suddenly freed of a
great agony. The day after to-morrow the
torments of alternating doubts and fears
would be over. There in that grave of living
women and men was a love-starved child--
let him think of her; let him think of the
saintly women and the heroic men who were
serving in that house of death.
The day after to-morrow, at nine o’clock in
the morning—and afterwards, what after-
wards? No, no! He wouldn’t think of it
—but he could think of nothing else. The
shock of Cheon’s departure had vitiated him,
left his mind the prey of the unwholesome
loneliness of the night.
What more terrible death than this
peopled silence could a sane man endure? He
had suffered death a hundred times in all
those awful hours since the heinous sentence
had been passed. He would not dwell on it.
ITe would give the few remaining hours left
.him to the memories of his youth, his home,
his friends, the future he had planned. But
no! The gibbering fates would not permit.
He must suffer this hell of recurring
thoughts, of recurring visions, and go over
and over the same futile questions till his
brain snapped.
Well, so be if. He would fight no longer
against the fiends of despair. He sat on the
edge of the miserable bed arid stared through
the barred door down the long corridor. At
the far end he dimly descried approaching
figures. There was something familiar about
that one in the lead. He closed his eyes,
refusing to be fooled by any pranks the
warder's light might play.
Ilis ears caught the tones of a well-known
voice—Justine, it ivas Justine, the man who
had .so splendidly defended him. Why was
Justine here? It was after midnight. He
sat forward, motionless, tense. The door
swung back. An eternity passed before Jus-
tine’s voice broke the silence.
“Farley!”
The hand on his shoulder was real, the
voice, the man who spoke his name. Yet fie
d.ared not respond, dared not risk the sound
oi his own voice lest the apparition vanish
and leave in its place the awful thing with
the shapeless head.
“Man! Don’t you hear me? You’re out
of this devil’s mess. It was Cheon—you
hear? Cheon! He shot Brodney for calling
him a dirty Chow. Here, you there! Come
and help me lift him outside —he’s fainted.”

THE
“ATCO”
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
Tttt^tocr
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keening in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, goit, lawn
tennis, P and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of.
park committees, hotelkeepers,-, etc. .
It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufhcient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes. . . ,
The running cost of an “ATGO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily; aiid -compdel:ely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture. ~ ~
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine. . ,
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-incli cutters, £loo complete.
Printed matter supplied with pleasure on application.

They come to you in a neat, easily-pocketed box. They strike
anywhere, hold their flame in the wind and burn longer than their
wooden rivals.
The outdoor man with a pipe to light when the breeze is blowing
swears by (not at) MALTESE CROSS MATCHES.
You should use them too.
