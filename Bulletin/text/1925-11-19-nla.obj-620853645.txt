The Red Page
Lawrence’s “St. Mawr”
The above-named book and the fact that
it is alleged to be banned in Maoriland
aroused It. S. Ross (R.P. 29/10/’25) to a
coruscation of brilliant adjectives and a rain
of nouns that has seldom been equalled. I
understand that Time and Space have been
waiting for this volume, and now that it
has arrived Destiny is fulfilled.
No one lias a right to object because there
are people who hold that guano is genius,
and that there can be no melody without
manure. But there is no reason why these
people should be so intolerant towards others
who don’t patronise the same brand of offal,
or why they should think they have said
something crushing when they call out “mid-
Victorian” — i.c., belonging to the age of
Tennyson and Swinburne, Dickens and
Thackeray, Gilbert and Sullivan, etc. The
remark is suburban, and even Pumblecliook-
ish. Many bright people lived (and also
died) in Victoria's time, and many more
haven’t been born since that time.
“St Mawr” isn’t 'impressive as a name:
The “w” is an affectation, and the “St.” is
Middle-Age, which is older than mid-Vic-
torian. "Lady Henry Carrington” is sugges-
tive of the Housemaid’s Weekly, and the
blessed stallion is antiquated. He should be
a motor-car. Even, the introspective lady
who is all doubled up with contemplation of
her own mental and spiritual innards is- not
a person in whom one is bound to take a
profound interest. The matter is optional,
like taking an interest in mathematics. It
is possible to be indifferent to such master-
pieces as “The Woman Who Did” and “The
Woman Who Intended To” and “The Female
with a Past” and “The .Vamp with a Great
Many Presents,” without being necessarily
mid-Atlantic, or any other trite arid bore-
some chestnut to that effect.
Some communities ban the importation of
drink, some of Communists, criminals and
lunatics, and some ban an occasional book
with introspective females in it. In the last
case the anger and contempt of Superior
Persons, who probably don’t care much for
the book but have to do so in order to re-
main Superior,' is very terrible. They are
rather late in the day. A very old and very
wise work on females is the Book of Pro-
verbs. In chapter 30 (the one which begins
in the quaint and picturesque Douay version
with “The words of Gatherer the son of
Yomiter”) there are three remarks about the
sex which should be classed as priceless. Yet
a prowd dozens of times larger than the
wligle population of Maoriland, including
maj|y learned gentlemep who wear skirts on
Sunday, prohibited the circulation of this
literary effort the first day it was printed
and even earlier. The ban isn’t lifted yet,
so far as I know, nor is that on the works
of Addison, Macaulay, Goldsmith, Anatole
France and hundreds more. Why should a
reviewer bark so furiously up the green
tree, as if jt was something unique, when
the dry tree amounts to a whole forest?
Mr. Ross quotes seven lines from “St.
Mawr,” and follows with the anguished cry:
“Madness, surely, to cast out such a chal-
lenging work!” Yet there is nothing aston-
ishing about the lines. Dickens supplied a
passing view of two United States liter-
ary ladies, both “transcendental,” by names
Miss Toppit and Miss Codger, who discoursed
in a rather similar vein. Said Miss Toppit:
Mind and matter glide swift into the vortex of
immensity. Howls the sublime, and softly sleeps the
calm ideal, in the whispering chambers of imagi-
nation. To hear it, sweet it is. But then out-
laughs the sterii philosopher, and saith to the
Grotesque, “What, ho! arrest for me that Agency.
Go, bring it here!” And so the vision fadeth.
That was “challenging” if you like. In an-
other quotation it appears that the heroine
of “St. Mawr” resolves to keep to herself
in future with “no more messing about.”
If she had the courage of her opinions why
didn’t she say “mucking about” or “hogging
round”?
JAMES EDMOND.
What is Australian Art?
. E. ColcloUgh (R.P. 22/TO/’25) disputes
“W.M.W.’s” opinion that “Art is Nature
seen through temperament,” adding that
“Max Meldrum comes within the category of
those who have temperament, and I presume
paints through it or by it or with it.” This,
as a matter of fact, is just what Max Mel-
drum denies. He insists that what he terms
pure art possesses nothing of the personality
of the painter. Art is an exact science, he
asserts; and the higher and purer the art
the less the individuality (or temperament)
it possesses. So the works of Great Masters
should closely resemble one another. Art in
his eyes is a thing of rules and exact order-
ings. Lie denies the existence of soul, of
emotion in painting; of inspiration, imagina-
tion or temperament. A painter is a mechan-
ism who must tune himself up to specialise
in optics so that he may become more exact
and infallible than a camera. And the
foundation of all this quaint doctrine is an'
astounding definition, which is announced so
dogmatically that many fail to realise just
what it does assert. Meldrum propounds that
art is science—the science of optics—nothing
else. Surely this amounts to calling beer
cold tea or a mastiff a beetle. It does not
matter how vociferously suefi statements are
shouted, they are not facts.
To say that art is science is similar to
suggesting that electricity is a piece of
copper wire or Melba’s voice a gramophone
needle. Certain science is used as a medium
for expressing art. The very paper, pig-
ments, canvas and drawing-pins have been
produced through scientific investigation.
And the general laws and methods of tech-
nique have essentially a scientific basis. But
art itself is the inward impulse that directs
the manipulation of the material apparatus.
Science will dye, manufacture, fold and
measure off a yard of colored ribbon; but it
was art that conceived its design.
The second clause in E. Colclough’s discus-
sion deals with Australian art. There should
be a distinctive Australian art, just as there
should be by now a distinctive Australian
literature and distinctive Australian music.
But none of these expressions of a national
soul can be evolved with self-conscious de-
liberation. The reason why many Australian-
made goods just fail to achieve distinction in
competition with the world’s markets is the
same as that which keeps Australian art at
a comparatively commonplace level. Neither
the Australian artist nor the Australian
tradesman will achieve anything that glows
with his inimitable individuality until he
loses himself in his work and does it for its
own sake and the joy of creation. The
mechanism and the- science are adequate and
sound in both cases. But until the frenzy
and fire of the creative artist inspires those
works, they will be unrecognisable from the
mediocre output of American, English,
Scotch or German Tom, I)ick and Harry.
A queer attitude of mind upon this sub-
ject of a distinctive Australian art is ex-
pressed in the generally-accepted aphorism
that the faithful and sincere interpretation
of Australian landscape should constitute a
distinctive Australian art. It really has
very little to do with the case. A talented
Australian realistic painter can reproduce
Morocco, Singapore, Iceland or Florida as
faithfully as he can the Australian bush-
scape. The sympathetic reproduction of a
country's flora and configuration has nothing
to do with an individual national art. The dis-
tinctive art of a country is a certain manner
or style of painting or sculpture peculiar
to that country. The oft-repeated accusation
that Australian artists are still tinged with
a European outlook involves a fallacy; for
the majority of the present generation of
painters are Australian-born and -bred, and
their brief visits to Europe have not been
able to affect their understanding and,concep-
tion of the Australian busliscape. But their
most faithful kodaking of Australian bush-
scape does not develop an individual Aus-
tralian art. Until pain, terror, intense
patriotism, want, love, distress or joy can
stir the psychology of the Australian to ex-
press itself in terms of paint and verse and
music, there will be no individuality in our
art. Streeton, Heysen, Herbert and Tom
Roberts interpret the Australian bush with
charm and sympathy. But each of these
artists can paint Yenice and London with
equal ability and faithful facility. Their
very fine and beautiful painting has nothing
to do with the revelation of a distinctive
national art. Some kind of crisis will
eventually stir this healthy, adolescent
nation into an individual self-expression. A
definition that is worthy of consideration
meanwhile is that “Art is the exquisite ex-
pression of lan intense (exquisite) impres-
sion.”
HATTIE KNIGHT.
An Experiment in Friendship
Walter EL Page, U.S.A. Ambassador to
Great Britain during the war, writing to a
friend in America, declared that “as the
world stands the United States and Great
Britain must work together and stand to-
gether. The thing, the only thing, is a per-
fect understanding between the English-
speaking peoples.” How best to bring about
an understanding which would have perma-
nency in it was a problem that exercised
ting thoughts of many American citizens im-
pressed by the significance -of what Page
had put so pregnantly. The thing aimed at
was such a mutual appreciation of each
nation by the other as would permeate beneath
the superficial assurances of friendship- 1 -,
something that would be knit into the lives
of the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon
race. Very wisely it was conceived that
the effort should begin with the education of
the young. “If,” wrote one desirous of pro-
moting Page’s object, “appreciation ,of the
people of the British Empire can be made a
part of the educational experience of the
average American citizen, our national con-
sciousness will never entertain even the
thought of serious dissension between this
country and Great Britain.”
Two years ago Mrs. Brooks-Aten, of New
York, translated thought into action with an
interesting experiment which has now passed
into a widespread system and become a re-
cognised part of American education. The
object of this Foundation was to encourage
the youth of the States “to gain an appreci-
ation of the historical, moral and philosophic
forces by which America and Great Britain,
including her Commonwealths, were linked.”
Membership is limited to secondary schools
whose pupils range from 14 to 20 years of
age inclusive. Each school joining enters
into the competitive lists for two classes of
prize essays on the subject of Anglo-
American friendship. Annual awards are
given in each member-school to its successful
essayist, and the winning composition is then
forwarded to the Foundation to be entered
in an interscholastic contest, the judges being
prominent educationists associated with such
institutions as Yale and Harvard. Each
school gives its own memorial cup “in
memory of those who died in the Great War
for the cause of peace.” These cups are of
silver, and the winner receives a miniature in
the form of a gold watch-charm. Where
providing its own cup has been found to be
beyond the resources of some of the less
financially fortunate schools, no difficulty
has been found in securing private donors!
It is a fine characteristic of the American ■
citizen that he rarely fails to meet an appeal
to his pocket for educational purposes. The
prizes for all the essays are worth while.
The winner of the present year’s inter-
scholastic essay received a scroll on vellum,
a return-trip ticket to England and a letter
of credit for £lOO, with letters of introduc-
tion which would ensure him attention, and
doubtless hospitality, at the hands of per-
sons interested in the Foundation on the
other side of the Atlantic.
The subject this year was “The benefit
to Christian civilisation front a complete
understanding and friendly relationship be-
tween the United States Of America and

Not on the battlefields of Roman legend,

DAVID JONES’
the British Empire.” The three prize essays,
which have, with portraits of the authors,
been published in neat book form, are inter-
esting, especially when they discuss the
characteristics which tend to a want of
understanding between the Englishman and
the American. One young Daniel castigates
his own country :
America has been guilty of anti-British complex
resulting entirely from ignorance of the past. Our
school histories have been shaped in such a way as
to cast the greatest resentment against England for
her several shortcomings, while they have concealed
her many virtuous dealings with America. There
has also been much flagrant antagonism through the
editorial columns of the newspapers. Here again the
fault has been America’s, and chiefly in virtue of
Mr. William Randolph Hearst’s attempts to draw
attention in a sensational way to England s past
failure through his several dailies.
In the case of each of the essayists there is
a suggestion of father and mother m the
background, but on the whole they appear to
be the outcome of individual reading and
thought, and express a genuine desire to
know the English kinsmen better and be
better known by them. It is an experiment
well worth carrying through.
T. B. C.
Dedications
One result of the invention of printing
and, within the last century, of the rapid
growth of the book trade, has been the
gradual disappearance of the elaborate
dedication. The early Christian scribes,
assured of heavenly protection, dedicated
their works to God ; later writers, generally
more sceptical and avaricious, laid their
labors at the feet of the wealthy iii expecta-
tion of patronage. The flamboyant* dedi-
cation became fashionable; and for centuries
writers vied with each other in the grace
and elegance of their flatteries. But fashions
have changed ; and that which was once an
art is now an affectation.
The whole history of artistic patronage
and literary parasitism may be read in the
dedications of the past. Until recently
writers seldom gained rumuneration com-
mensurate with their labors. Their profes-
sion being allied to poverty, they were
driven to seek help from the wealthy; and,
aware of human weakness, they gained en-
trance to the pockets of their patrons
through the channel of personal praise.
No man is altogether invulnerable to the
arrows of adulation. To shine before one’s
fellows in the gleam of elegant blandishment
is a temptation too strong for the resistance
of the average mortal. Needy writers knew
this; and by hiding the hook with the fat
worms of flattery, they landed their gold
fish. But the dedication served a double
purpose. It was profitable alike to patron
and to patronised. The former for a few
pounds was enabled to cling to the fringes of
fame; the latter had the satisfaction of
watching his work soar into the literary
empyrean by means of a dedication which,
balloon-like, he had inflated to the limits of
elasticity with the hot-air of specious com-
pliment.
No doubt many patrons w'ere paragons.
Maecenas, the patron of Horace, and the
Earl of Southampton, who fathered the
poems of Shakspeare, were men of charm
and considerable learning. The long and
brilliant dedications of Dryden and Jeremy
Taylor have become part of English liter-
ature. The nobility of their high calling
is never surrendered. The dignity of their
diction and charm of manner is displayed in
conscious art. But the literary man was
not always particular in his choice of a
patron. In composing his dedicatory epistle
he scorned neither to paint the lily nor
to gild the pill. There was no virtue too
great and no metaphor too saccharine to
apply to the dedicatee. In some cases the
pusillanimous peer was shouldered with the
attributes of the Deity in words which
boiled down, meant, “Dear sir, —Although
I am not fit to lick your boots, you are ready
to buy my flattery for a fiver.”
Writers were not always content with a
single patron ; and many quaint devices were
framed to net a new one. The poet being forced
to serve both Muse and Mammon, and dedica-
tions in the early days of printing carrying
a fee, it is not surprising to find books with
more than one title-page, each bearing a dedi-
cation ; and books divided into numerous sec-
tions, each prefaced by a lavish outpouring.
One writer dedicated even his index to a
patron. Others issued their books in limited
numbers at a time, and with each new batch
printed a fresh dedication. Perhaps the book
with the greatest number is one on Martyr-
clogy, edited by Politi, which has a separate
dedication for each of the 365 days in the
year.
In England before the reign of George I.
the price for the dedication of a play was
fixed at £10 —a kind of basic wage. But
many authors, by judicious choice and the
exercise of nimble wits, gained much more
from those who fed on the puff-pastry of
their pi&ise. The literary tuft-hunting reached
its zenith in the seventeenth century; and
in certain Continental States special legis-
lation was introduced to prevent the pro-
miscuous sale of these-articles. The authors
were not always to blame; the flattered
sometimes stooped lower than the flatterer
and poured out his own honey.
Now that modern writers no longer pros-
trate themselves before their patrons, dedi-
cations are curtailed to the smallest compass
and used chiefly as an act of homage or mark
of affection. There is the type—one of the
commonest to-day—which says succinctly
“To Dick”; and the type which disarms
criticism with such candid confession as “To
my wife, without whose encouragement this
book would never have been written.” Less
common is the type in which the impish
author preserves the ghostly memory of
a light o’ love on his title-page by inscribing
his work “To Helen, who once held my
happiness in her hands.” And there is the
chronic optimist whose dedication is confi-
dently addressed “To the Dream of To-day
and the Hope of To-morrow.” Against these
commonplace and uninspired types one is
able to set a few examples of wit and orig-
inality. T. W. H. Crosland dedicated his
satirical study of Woman “To the exception
who in twelve merry months proved all the
rules.” Whistler, with his customary irony,
wrote inside the title-page of his “Gentle
Art of Making Enemies”: “To the rare
Few, who, early in Life, have rid Themselves
of the Friendship of the Many, these path-
etic Papers are inscribed.” And John David-
son made his dedication “To My Enemy” :
Unwilling friend, let not your spite abate:
Help me with scorn, and strengthen me with hate.
But the old art is dead. The literary dedi-
cation belonged to a leisured age. The
author’s chief exercise to-day is not to pro-
pitiate a patron, but to prevail on a pub-
lisher. It is he who controls the modern
book trade; and he is more concerned with
profit than praise.
KEG S. ELLERY.
Resurrecting Shakspeare
How much of what we read and quote
as Shakspcare was written by the man who
may have been Bacon—if lie was not the
Earl of Essex? The question is prompted
by Dr. Leon Kellner, in his Restoring Shaks-
peare (Allen and Unwin). Kellner, who
spent 15 years over his “textual studies ’
offers an example of the research which
some people think it profitable to make
into matters that to most of us seem of no
great importance. Yet even to those who
might regard the trouble as over-great, the
result is sometimes interesting.
The painful method which the meticulous
Kellner adopted was first to make a study
of Elizabethan script, and then very care-
fully write out in that script suspected pas-
sages ; by this means he judged that he would
be able to trace where copyists or printers
made, or were likely to make, errors. He
has been able thus to fill a book with illus-
trations, albeit he has hardly gone beyond
“The Merchant of Venice.” If lie can detect
so many mistakes, and probable mistakes, in
that one play, how many may there be in
the whole Shakspearean collection? And
in practically every case he brings strong
evidence —often most conclusive evidence —-
to support his case. Every edition of Shaks-
peare will give you this (Shylock is speak-
ing) :
Let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh.
Kellner thinks the “for” should be “say,”
and that seems feasible. The old English
“S” and a poor formation of the “ay” may
explain the mistake. “Say” is certainly
the better word. Worse erroi’S have occurred,
and still occur. I once wrote a verse for
the Melbourne Punch of old, in which I re-
ferred to laughter as “filling every pulsing
vein.” The printer made it “filling every
puking vein.”
Kellner quotes Portia’s speech :
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged .me by his wit,
TTpt-a or Theobald suggested, “will” seems a
much more likely word than “wit.” Other
errors are self-evident. For instance, “seat”
seems obvious where the printed line says :
Which makes her feat of Belmont Oolcho’s strand.
But there are numerous occasions when the
suggested correction is more intriguing. As
for example : —-
But my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
Hath left me gaged.
Kellner says that “time” should be “life” —
“liue” as Shakspeare, in the style of his age,
probably wrote it. In another passage where
“pale” appears he claims the word should
be “pat” (probably written “pate”), which
in Shakspeare’s day meant ready, obsequious.
The line now appears:—
Thou pale and common drudge.
In a similar fashion the old English “herd"
for “heard” may have been mistaken by the
blundering copyist, when, after Tubal re-
ports “Antonio, as I heard, in Genoa,” Shy-
lock replies:—
Good news I Good news! Ha, ha! here in Genoa !
Obviously Antonio w r asn’t “here” in Genoa
when Shylock and Tubal were discussing the
matter in Venice.
To turn from “The Merchant,” take this
passage from “Henry IV.” : —•
And had a purpose now
To lead out many to the Holy Land.
Kellner’s reasonable surmise, built up on
his Elizabethan script of the passage, is that
“out many” was “our army.”
It is almost needless to say that Kellner
is a man of Central Europe—a professor at
Vienna University, who compiled “Historical
Outlines of English Syntax,” an English
text-book. Austria and Germany have laid
a strong hold on Shakspeare, about whom
more books have been written than about
any other person except Christ, most of them
by Germans or Austrians. This latest com
mentator has at least given the pedants som:
few additional items to quarrel over.
HAROLD MERCER.
Hugo and “Notre Dame”
There are fashions in books as in every-
thing else. The furnishings of the mind,
like the furnishings of the body, have their
seasons, and in letters as in life, almost be-
fore we are aware, the crinoline floats in
upon us in a setting of red plush and gilt
mirrors, with strange waxen fruits flourish-
ing under glass shades. The phase passes,
only to give place to the enforced picturesque
of pre-Raphaelitism, or the stark ugliness of
the leg-o’-muhton sleeve. The eighteenth
century had no time for Shakspcare. Most
of the great Elizabethan dramatists were
piously resurrected by Lamb after a century
or more of cobwebs and contumely. Pope,
the prince of the Augustans, was hounded
from the halls of/ poetry by the romantics.
Meredith is still {caviare to the multitude.
And it takes the might of a Feature Film
to stir the dust on> the covers of the library
edition of Victor Hugo, the lion of his day.
the very embodiment of romance, the pillar
of literary liberalism. Nowadays Hugo’s
novels are scarcely read, his plays are fus-
tian, and the great (volume of his poetry must
pass through the ’ sieve to be appreciated.
Yet the tremendous stature of the man re-
mains. He was vain, he was a good hater —
with a very long memory. Nisard, the critic,
was not greatly impressed with his early
verse. Hugo waited 30 years to retaliate
with : “An ass that looks like M. Nisard is
braying.” Even in exile he was theatrical.
He liked to compare*himself in his aloofness
to Atlas and Monti Blanc, or, better still,
to a flaming torch. There was no false
modesty about the Romantics of 1830, and
humor was not Hugo’s strong point.
He had few, if any, original ideas, but
throughout the 69 years of his writing life
he was never less than a great artist. In
the first place, there was about his work
much of that fine excess with which Keats
says poetry should surprise us. When he
steered clear of rhetoric there was a fan-
tastic unexpectedness in his flashing phrases,
lie talked irresistibly of putting liberty’s
red cap on the old dictionary, or crushing
the spirals of the paraphrase, but he could
not write a love poem, possibly because he
hardly attempted to, till lie was between 30
and 40 years old. He was happier in the
more exquisite of the verses that sang his
love for children, and, above all. in the lyric
satire of “Les Chatiments,” which at its best
touches the peaks. Yet he dabbled in puns
and politics, and was capable of writing a
study of Shakspeare without touching on
his psychology. Neither science nor philo-
sophy had any charms for him, though the
profoundly original views that were strug-
gling into the world, on both mind and
matter, made so vast an impression on his
contemporaries across the Channel, giving
depth to and often coloring their work. It
makes it easier to realise why Hugo could
create a Quasimodo, but not a Caliban. Un-
like most great poets, whose ideas are gen-
erally a little ahead of their age, Hugo,
so ambitious in other respects, was in tins
regard content to live from day to day. And
in many ways this led him to devote him-
self to embodying most of the least perma-
nent features of romanticism.
It is true, of course, that he championed
the weak, that he would have replaced the
prison with the school, that he lived for
liberty and brotherhood, and that he made
a virtue of his hatred of the Bonapartes. Yet
he makes one think of a beautiful crystal
pool that is never turbid, because there are
no great depths to be troubled. Sometimes
he wearies us with his repetition of ideas
with capital letters: Justice, Love, Reason,
Faith, Beauty, Truth, Fraternity. Peace,
Civilisation, Virtue, Liberty tumble head
over heels from his pen—a quill pen natu-
rally. It is all very typical of the mental
pose of his day, and it is only fair to re-
member that in 1848 his philosophic phrases
were not the cliches that they are to-day.
There was something strikingly robust about
his genius; he was moulded in the grand
and the large manner; it was a matter of
physical well-being almost as much as men-
tality. He was more interested in life than
in death, and had a perfectly definite belief
in the ultimate perfectibility of humanity.
The isles of disenchantment, familiar ground
to Vigny and Musset, for Hugo simply did
not exist. In 1830 one had to be melancholy,
but thoughts of mortality and especially of
wormy circumstance were not his pasture.
For all his magnificent imagery he re-
velled in the commonplace, inspired and fas-
cinated by events from day to day, some-
thing of a journalist, as wmll as a poet. A
very limited set of ideas satisfied him, and
gave him a strong tendency to repeat himself
i)i metaphors and phrases, but they were
often worth repeating. His great originality
lay not in invention or choice of subject, but
in the form he gave it, the unceasing
mastery of rhythm, and lyric perfection.
He is at his greatest when he writes of
things, for lie has a subtlety that gives life
to stocks and stones. And so “Notre Dame
de Paris” is a poor novel, as far as the por-
trayal of men and women is concerned, but
the very stones of it are instinct with life.
Balzac also had this gift of giving life to
things, but Balzac was a psychologist as well,
whereas, for all Hugo’s art, the Cathedral,
and not Esmeralda, is the heroine. His
cathedral lives, as Ilernani, for instance,
does not. The most memorable part of the
novels of this “virtuoso of the synonym” is
the setting. The people, though theatrically
splendid, are hardly flesh and blood. As
Anatole France once said, Hugo was “a
great visionary and a peerless artist, which
is a great deal, but it is not everything.”

A Satchel of Books
Ruminations, by Arthur McDovvaU (Heinemann).
To-day the world craves for a more exciting and
stimulating literary food than the essay. Still, a
few of the birds from the old nest flutter their
wings. Mr. McDowall’s essays cover a wide field, from
cows to cosmopolitan parsons, and he is cheerful and
optimistic in his outlook.
The Gap (Keating-Wood Pty.). An annual maga-
zine circulating in the schools of the Bairnsdale
(Vic.) inspector’s district, the joint production of
inspector, teachers and pupils, aided by parents and
others. To it belongs the distinction of having been
the forerunner of all the Vic. State-school magazines
—it has reached its sixth issue. It is all Australian,
and largely young Australian, from cover to cover,
thoroughly interesting, well-conceived and well-pro-
duced.
The, Ways of Knowing, by W. P. Montague (Allen
and Unwin). One of a series in “The Library of
Philosophy.” As to a section of the book the
author has adopted the plan of throwing the discus-
sion of the epistemological problem, involving a
reconciliation of realism and idealism, into the form
of a dialogue. On this question there are three
classic theories, each contending against the others
—one of realism, another of idealism and the third
dualism. The author’s object is so to restate these
rival contentions as to show that they may be
made not only compatible with, but implicative of,
one another. " In his general plan of treatment,
Professor Montague has followed that adopted by
Sidgwick in his “Methods of Ethics.”
Hints on Auction Bridge, by Lieut.-Col. S. H.
Hinkley (Bell and Sons). Though many play, few
play a decent game, and if the many really desire
to improve their card culture, they can scarcely have
a better teacher than this military expert, who has
all the strategic moves at his fingers’ ends. How
to make “no trumps” out of an apparently hopeless
hand is worth knowing, and the Lieut.-Col. will
show you just how far you may dare and double.
“The only partner worth having,” he remarks, “and
the only one you can rely on in this speculative and
chancy game, is the player who follows hard-and-
fast rules for the original suit bids.”

“Karaji”: The assertion by “Ces” (B. 22/10/’25)
that the recent translation of the Gospel according
to St. Luke into Arunta is the first time it has
appeared in an abo. dialect is incorrect. The Mora-
vian missionary L. E. Threlkeld —he toiled at Lake
Macquarie, on the site of the present Toronto
Hotel —completed his translation of the Gospel afore-
said in 1831. The original manuscript was illu-
minated by Annie Layard, daughter of the explorer
of Nineveh. I do not know when it first reached
the printer’s hands, but a fourth edition appeared in
1557.

PACKARD SUPERIORITY
THE Packard Straight-Eight is the embodiment of all that is superior in motoring
both for comfort and outstanding performance. Packard has consistently
pioneered the sphere of motor improvements and the Straight-Eight incorporates
many ideas which are to be found in no other car in the world. Not only has the
Packard these advantages but also it is built to wear well for twice as long as other
makes. Packard protects its owners by having a standardised appearance and by
offering no yearly models. Thus the Packard is a better investment than cars of high-
er or lower prices it lasts longer than cheaper cars and gives greater service and
distinction than dearer cars, for a smaller initial outlay.
Exclusive Packard Features
Packard Straight-Eight features include an exclusive Fuelizer, which speeds
up acceleration, shortens the warming-up period, reduces carbonisation of
spark plugs and valves, contributes to fuel economy and lessens crank-
case dilution ; underslung front springs, shackled at front end, solving the
steering problem that came with low pressure tyres; exclusive chassis
pressure lubricator which oils each of the 45 chassis points requiring regu-
lar lubrication, by means of a pressure pump plunger; the motor oil recti-
fier, which prevents dilution and retains the viscous condition of the
motor oil; brake step-up gear, an exclusive Packard feature, multiplies the
braking pressure as the foot pedal is depressed.

allotment. Balance in calls of 2/6 per share at intervals of not less than one month.
30,000 shares credited as fully paid up to be issued to De Forest Phonofilms, Ltd., London, in part consideration
for the granting of exclusive license and rights to the Australian Company.
15,000 shares credited as fully paid up to be issued' to the Promoters in consideration of special work in connection
with the promotion, formation and incorporation of the Company and acquisition of the license.
15,000 shares to be held in reserve.
Objects.
The objects of the company are to use and exercise
De Forest Inventions in Australia —that is to say, cer-
tain inventions, patents and patent rights relating to
Phonofilms, or the photographic method of recording
sound on celluloid or other material, and the method of
projecting or translating sound so recorded, whether sepa-
rately or in combination with pictures made by or
belonging to Dr. Lee De Forest, of New York, U.S.A.,
for a period of approximately 14 years, together with
the benefit during such period of all modifications and
improvements on the said inventions, and of all further
inventions in connection with the said subject mattei
which may hereafter be made or acquired by Dr. De
Forest, and to make and to produce copies of rhonofilm.
Prospects.
Dr. Lee De Forest’s Phonofilms are at present being
released and shown in the United States of America mid
in London, and will be showing in Wellington (N.Z.)
theatres before Christmas. Highly remunerative returns
are being obtained in America and London, and the supply
cf Phonofilm can hardly keep pace with the demand.
The rights for the British Empire (with the exception
of Canada) have been acquired by an English company,
De Forest Plionofilms, Ltd., of 12 Craven House,
Kingsway, London, and associated with Dr. De Forest
in this company is Mr. C. F. Elwell, B.A. (a native of
Sydney), a gentleman of high scientific attainments and
repute in the field of wireless telegraphy and kindred
branches of physical science. As an indication of the
rapid commercial development of Plionofilms, it may be
stated that the De Forest Phonofilm Corporation of America
had recently to increase its capital to keep pace with
development, and for the same reason it is proposed to
materially increase the capital of De Forest Plionofilms,
Ltd., London. A brief survey of the field of cinemato-
graph enterprises will suffice to convince the most conser-
vative investor of the possibilities and lucrative nature
of these rights.
The advent of Phonofilm will inevitably give added zest
and interest to the ordinary programmes, and it is obvi-
ous that those theatres which do not include Phonofilm
amongst their screenings will not attract the public in the
same measure as those which regularly display the
speaking picture. In addition to the use of Phonofilm
as part of tlio regular cinema programme, it holds
immense possibilities as an advertising medium.
Management.
The head office of the Company will be located in
Sydney, under efficient management, and it is proposed
to take advantage of the wide field offering in Australia
by equipping a studio in Sydney and making Phonofilm
in this country. Splendid speaking pictures are being
made in England by the English Company, and some of
these will be shown in New Zealand in the course of a
week or two.
Demonstrations of Phonofilm.
Demonstrations of Phonofilm were given in the Tivoli
Theatre, Wellington (N.Z.), and the Piccadilly Theatre,
Sydney. Phonofilm screened at these demonstrations did
rot exceed five hundred feet for each subject, and were
some of the earliest Plionofilms made. In both countries
the Press were unanimous that the possibilities of Phono-
film appeared to be unlimited. Since the demonstrations
were given some splendid productions have been turned
out, including Balieffs Cliauve Sonoris, a magnificent
speaking film in color.
Early Application Should be Made.
Applications will be dealt with in order of receipt, and in the event of the issue being over-
subscribed, the Directors reserve the right to make pro rata allotments. The share issue to tne
public in the New Zealand Company was over-subscribed in less than one month, and, in view oi
this and the attractive nature of the investment, the Directors anticipate that the whole ot the issue
in Australia will be quickly taken up. Already some thousands cf shares have been applied 101.
This can be verified on application to the Brokers. ,
Application for shares should be made on the accompanying form, and sent to tne rsroKeis,
Messrs. Wm. Tilley and Co., 78 Pitt Street, Sydney.
EDWARD MARSHALL,
one of the world’s leading news-
paper men, in a letter to Dr. De
Forest wrote as follows: —
“The experienced newspaper-
man sees and hears many strange
things. That’s his business. But
he seldom encounters magic. Your
‘Phonofilm’ is magic. To re-
produce pictures by light is no
longer amaz f ng; to talk with light
is as astonishing as the miracles
of old. And you are doing it.
Your speaking picture is the
greatest contribution to education
and entertainment which has been
made in more than a decade. Bern-
hardt died the other day. If she
had spent an hour before your
camera she never could have died.
“Lincoln’s Gettysburg address
is the greatest bit of modern
literature in print. It is an in-
spiration. If we had it and him
on the ‘Phonofilm’ as he delivered
that address, it would be greater
than literature; it would he

D"B. Allen's
MEXICAN
IMUOT SWM
“Why, she looks as young and charming as her daughter.” How
often have you heard these words spoken about women who have retained
their girlish appearance while their family is quickly growing up around
them! Have you ever stopped to think what the real secret of their
youth is? The turning-point of youth to early middle-age comes when a
little silvery grey creeps in amongst that crowning glory of women—their
hair. No matter the youthful bloom upon the cheek, or the figure its easy
girlish form, the hair appearance is the mirror of the age.
Stop for a moment and think of the really smart women that you
know ; they do not allow those tell-tale grey hairs, the unmistakable symbol
of advancing years, to creep in and spoil their beauty.
Grey hair can never be fashionable—it is the first sign of old age. A
man may be as old as he feels —but a woman is as old as her hair.
Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain has enjoyed the confidence of women
for 25 years—it is perfectly harmless, easy to apply, immediate in action,
and, above all, undetectable. Carefully carry out the instructions and let
it restore your hair to its natural shade. Grey hairs will vanish like magic
and youth will walk in at your door.
VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Numads.
There is honey in the wild bees’ nest,
There is music in the rushes of the fen,
The wild swans are homing to the west;
But man flies homeless with a pen.
The little gods are masters of the great,
Zeus hangs by his heels to a tale;
The glory of the legions at the gate
Is a widowed city sinking in a waiL
Love is running wild and white through olden
trees,
Love is fainting upon cushions smeared
with wine;
When the draught of life is drunken to the
lees
There are redder grapes in cluster on the
vine.
Who shall sail with young adventure on the
deep?
There are shores beyond the last shore
known,
Where a thousand turning planets in their
sleep
Move each upon a pathway of its own.
There are shores beyond the last shore seen,
Where the pent electron shudders on a
wire;
And the keel may glide to lands of gold and
green
As the lens-bound lights expire.
Not here shall we rest for ease of toil,
Not here shall we stay for peace of heart;
Our hands are set to gathering the spoil.
And the havens of the dream are far apart.
Pipe, shepherd, pipe upon the hills!
Send your breath through the hollow of
the reed !
Down the thymy slope a silver music spills;
But where shall to-morrow’s pasture lead?
There is honey in the wild bees’ nest,
The green shoot breaks from the loam ;
But the words of men go winging to the west,
And the feet of men are far and far from
home!

Secure from memory’s revenge I fain
Would sink my soul in nothingness again
And all my drouth for cooling sleep appease !
But as I near the pleasant land of dreams
All harsher outlines fade in pearly mist.
Ah love, there is no past save when we

With waking day’s last glimpse there faintly

RESPONSIBILITY.
It is probable that at some early stage the
Missing Link —really it was a missing chain,
for a good many links have already been
found —existed in a state of delightful free-
dom from responsibility. He cracked nuts
where he found them ; his breakfast shaded
off into his dinner, and his dinner into his
supper, with a lot of fine gymnastic exercise
during meals. His wife was just as light-
hearted and care-free as he, and the children
took up the merry game of life with prac-
tical jokes played on Dad's tail or Mum’s
whiskers. But by the time man, with a
hairless back, had become a cave-dweller of
the lowest type, responsibility sat heavily
upon his shoulders. Responsibility for the
family marked the chief mental development
of man as man. The care-free life of the
forest passed ; the yelling of the mail-pack in
the communism of the early chase died down ;
and man, lonely and fearing, but with a pas-
sion of responsibility for the woman and
the man cubs in the smoky cave, sat glower-
ing into the dark on the night when the wolf-
pack clamored or the hunting cry of the
tiger came too near. The keynote of respon-
sibility was fear, but a fear thafi called both
to courage and to cunning for salvation. Re-
sponsible man lived for ages in such terror
as developed many thought-processes, and
his thinking gradually led him to the forma-
tion of the tribe. Food scarcity during dread-
ful periods of calamity probably delayed the
tribal formation or broke it up from time
to time; but the fact that 20 acting together
could divide their responsibility and secure
greater safety seems to have been balanced
in the primitive mind against the greater
difficulty of obtaining food for a multitude.
By the adoption of the tribal system man
took on more labor that he might have more
safety; and in doing so his mind was imme :
diately directed towards finding means to
lighten that labor. This led to invention,
the primitive science of agriculture, primi-
tive pottery and many other things; then
to story-telling, games, poetry and all the
exercises of a growing leisure for thought
and laughter. It is not possible to trace
the animal that became man through its
social stages; but the chain is fairly com-
plete from the family into the cave to the
little tribe in many caves and the bigger
tribe in beehive huts or dug-outs. The line
of human advance follows exactly the line
of diminishing individual responsibility.
It is true that responsibility did not cease
with the formation of the tribe; it only
altered its nature and viewpoint. But tribal
responsibility, though it occasionally called
for the highest and most terrible per-
sonal sacrifice, was never the grim and awful
thing personal responsibility had been to
the lonely father in the cave on tiger-night.
Sacrifice now had behind it tribal applause
and the sense of social support; and linked
with these was primitive religion—a further
lightening of responsibility by putting some
of it on the shoulders of the gods. The per-
son with full tribal responsibility could often
go almost gaily to his death for the sake of
his gods, the tribal honor and the women
and children ; and the spirit thus created has
lived on into modern war, and is still apt
to thrill men in the blowing of bugles and
beating of drums. The responsibility had
grown into pride and desire of glory; but
it was continually lightened by subdivision,
and less and less interfered with the thought
that was running to improvements of other
sorts. Agriculture grew; the working of
metal opened up new paths; the loom made
the skins of animals less necessary; domestic
animals increased in number and variety;
the potter’s wheel turned out all manner
of labor-saving and food-saving devices; and
in the general advance love of ornament led
to the first strokes of art. The tribe ex-
tended into the State ; responsibility dwindled
more and more, and art caught at the skirts
of beauty and rendered life worth while for
its own sake. Of course, the current did
not run straight—it never does in the affairs
of man or nature —but it is quite clear that,
in proportion to his freedom from the respon-
sibility of maintaining his fight against
danger, man advanced in all the directions
which humanity still believes stand for high-
est achievement. Freedom to do greater
things led nearly always to the doing of
greater things.
#.'***
The cave-man acknowledged instinctively
his responsibility for the man-cub in the reek-
ing cave; the tribesman proudly boasted his
responsibility for the thousand families that
must be defended in war and provided for
in peace; the citizen of the early State
accepted his responsibility to uphold the sys-
tem that gave him room to work and follow
his better instincts; and all these may be
regarded as steps towards sqme sort of a
goal. Such a goal has been reached. There
are people whose outlook is still that of the
early cave-man ; there are many in the tribal
stage of development; war and other calami-
ties can re-create for a moment or a year
the conditions of any period of human pro-
gress ; a jazz band may even take people
back to the missing-link stage of irrespon-
sible nut-cracking. But certain world-gains
remain ; and chief among these must be set
the liberty to enter fields of human endeavor
far removed from the guardianship of a cave
or the struggle for to-morrow’s breakfast.
The man who wanted to carve a mammoth
bone instantly recognised that the call to
defend the tribal stockade was of vastly
greater importance than his artistic inclina-
tions ; but that should no longer find a true
parallel in the world to-day. To put “the
case, baldly, the man who can produce a
statue to delight the ages is shirking his
responsibility if he prefers the easier path
of making comfortable profits by selling tea.
The line of evolutionary progress through
the survival of the fittest runs on into the
realm of thought and highest mental en-
deavor ; yet we shall never have the full
benefit of mental endeavor till the path is
made reasonably safe for the persons re-
sponsible for the higher adventure. The
medical man who hesitates between a com-
fortable practice and great research work,
with its accompaniment of poverty for those
nearest to him, is relatively in the position
of the man who sat glowering between fear
and responsibility in the cave mouth. A
farther parallel is wanted; the tribe must
close up around him and lift some of his
burden. It is a world responsibility to give
a certain security to those responsible for
the world.
MELBOURNE’S RING OF SLUMS.
Populous Richmond, one of the inner
suburbs of Melbourne, had a bylaw to the
effect that no future building block should
have a less frontage than 22ft.; and the
rescission of that not too liberal provision
illustrates the necessity for some greater
authority to exercise control over the growth
of the city.
* * * *
The people who designed Melbourne con-
nived a noble plan; and it is really no
discredit to them that they were unable to
conceive of a city with such a population in
so small a State, in view of their knowledge
of other good sites for rival cities. Arterial
roads from the city were their main con-
sideration ; and with the idea that mere
villages would be formed along these roads,
thoroughfares which, in their time, might
have been delightful country lanes were
allowed to come into being. As country
lanes they were all right, but as the city
grew and enveloped these areas the country
lanes became alleys; and so Melbourne has
become ringed with municipalities which
ceased long ago to resemble, villages; and
with frowning factories alternating with
frowsy houses that hang on to life till they
are crushed out, the lanes have too often
grown into slums. Soaring land prices have
given the owners of little allotments a vision
of riches they, do not easily forsake; and
the divided civic authority in what is really
Melbourne city stands in the path of im-
provement. When even a prominent Labor
official and councillor is known to be
an opponent of any measure which
may loose his hold on his precious pocket-
handkerchief allotments, the difficulty of
doing much under existing conditions of
government is obvious. The State Parlia-
ment has had the ill effects of the present
lack of system pointed out to it, and
as a means of shelving determined action the
Town Planning Commission was formed.
The Commission is an honest body with a
definite idea about what should be its jab;
but Parliament gave it no mandate to do
the job. It can recommend improvements,
its. recommendations undoubtedly having
weight; but what happens to them depends
entirely upon the sympathy they receive
from the various scattered bodies which have
to deal with the problems for which they
supply solutions. Where local interests are
concerned they get very little sympathy.
The Commission, being a polite body, does
not mention slums ; it merely says that there
exist “undesirable housing conditions” which
it would like to alter if it could. Recently it
made recommendations tathe Richmond Coun-
cil for the reconstruction of Victoria-street;
and, as the alteration of that thoroughfare,
which connects the city with Kew, Camber-
well and Hawthorn, would necessitate the
demolition of a large number of buildings,
it took into consideration the entire recon-
struction of an area running between Vic-
toria-street on the one side and Elizabeth
and Baker streets on the other, from Hoddle-
street to the river—further up towards the
city Victoria-street is a comparatively fine
boulevard. The Commission found within this
area (not a particularly bad one) that, out
of 528 properties, 135 had frontages of under
16 feet, and 138 a depth of less than 75
feet, while there were numerous dwellings
of wood or galvanised-iron which had less
than a 12-foot frontage and a 70-foot depth
—places erected before the Board of Health’s
regulation of 1650 square feet as the mini-
mum superficial area for a building allot-
ment was introduced. The Commission drew
plans which, in place of the existing houses,
provided for 509 desirable buildings capable
of comfortably housing 2545 people (the
present population of the area is 2080),
while making provision in each block of
houses for a children’s playground. But its
suggestions have not a fraction of a chance
of adoption by the Council which turned
down the 22-foot allotment bylaw.
* * * *
Yet Richmond is not by any means the
worst of the slum areas or the most hostile
to suggested improvements. Port Melbourne
has no bylaw governing the size of allotments ;
South Melbourne provides that a dwell-
ing may not be erected on a less superficial
area than 1650 sq. feet (which is merely
the Board of Health’s minimum), but has
many old hovels built on less than that;
Fitzroy, which provided that a dwelling may
not occupy an allotment covering less than
1800 sq. feet, has a density of population
of 60.46 per acre in the West Ward—it
works out to nearly 40,000 people per sq.
mile —and an average of 35.86 .in the whole
municipality; and even in once-proud
Prahran the only regulation is that every
dwelling must have attached to it an open
area of 400 square feet, which may mean
a 10-x-lO yard and a dark, damp passage
beside the house. In a number of muni-
cipalities the councils are so little interested
that they have no information about the
size of the allotments upon which the dwell-
ings in their districts are built. Of the
better regulated municipalities Caulfield in-
sists upon a minimum frontage of 50 feet
and a minimum area of 6000 feet; 1 its popu-
lation density is 10.17 per acre, with 15.65
per acre in its most crowded part. Caul-
' field, of course, is a “better-class” suburb ;
but Coburg, a working-man’s suburb, is
almost as satisfactory—it has about the best
municipal government in Melbourne. The
superficial area required for building allot-
ments here is 4000 feet; actually the aver-
age utilised for buildings is about 5000 feet.
The population density is 14.75 per acre.
Such figures are reflected in the metropoli-
tan death statistics. Malvern (a place which
includes many mansions standing in
large grounds) has, excepting the far-
out Sandringham, the lowest general death-
average in Melbourne, 8.45 per 1000 people ;
except Oakleigh, another widespread suburb,
the lowest infantile death-rate, 3.91 per 100
births. Next in this matter of death-rate
come Coburg with 8.61 and Caulfield with
8.82; their infantile death-rates are 5.59 and
5.87 respectively. Compare these with the
near-city slum areas’ death-rates: —

Footscray .. • • 10.02 7.71
Prahran .. •• 12.06 t. 52
Richmond . . • ■ 10.80 6.98
These averages might be higher only that
a number of the deaths strictly chargeable
to these suburbs are set down to the
account of the city, whose figures are 12.85
and 9.12 ; it is these near-city areas which
provide most of the population of the city
hospitals. Herod was not more flinty-
hearted towards the infants he slaugh-
tered than some of these slum-owning muni-
dualities are when resistance to improvement
is in the interests of influential ratepayers.
The Town Planning Commission is doing
its best to improve matters, as far as mere
recommendations can. improve them, and
sometimes it succeeds in shaming authorities
into action. After a long battle it secured the
Spencer-street bridge, and a corollary will be
the Hanna-street reconstruction scheme, pro-
viding a new road connecting the bridge with
St. Kilda-road. This will cause the rebuild-
ing of an area of shocking tenements which
had a unique sort of water frontage; with
heavy rains or high tides the water runs
through the houses. The Bridge-road (Rich-
mond) and Mount Alexander-road recon-
structions are to its credit; but to enforce
the carrying out of all the work necessary
a body with authority over the whole metro-
politan area is necessary. The councils of the
districts which most need it are the strongest
resisters of all improvement; they have even
obstructed the enforcement of the law deal-
ing with the conduct of boarding- and
lodging-houses, maintaining such scandals as
the cramping of 53 people into an old house
originally possessing 11 rooms. A Greater
Melbourne authority is the one solution of
a problem which becomes worse with every
year’s growth of Victoria’s overgrown capital.
AUSTRALIA, REPARATIONS AND
DISEASE.
It was mentioned a few months ago that
Australia is soon to receive £135,000 from
Germany as her share of a reparation pay-
ment. What are we going to do with it?
Not, surely, spend it on things of trade!
For, after all, is it not blood-money? Does
it not come to us as part of the price of
the sacrifice of 60,000 of our best lives, to
say nothing of the misery endured by those
who returned? As it represents the price
of life and suffering, surely its best use is
towards anything that will save life and
suffering. Some might suggest the endow-
ment of hospitals; but a far more long-
sighted plan would be to use it for the
furtherance of the knowledge of disease,
with the object of preventing disease. Why
not let us set aside this sum for the endow-
ment of medical research?
The late war proved the incalculable value
of preventive medicine —how disease that in
the past had almost obliterated armies could
be held back. In the same way much disease
here in Australia is preventible. But before
we can advance further in this direction we
must know more of the diseases, especially
those common in Australia, which each year
kill off thousands of our best immigrants,
the babies born in Australia, besides costing
the country millions of money.
The older men and women of this country
have to face the very unpleasant fact that
one out of every five or six of them is
destined to fall a victim to cancer, and in
course of time the same spectre will face
the younger generations too. Why should they
have to face it? Young married women have
to face the dangers of childbirth and its
sometimes unfortunate results on health with
its attendant misery. Why should these dan-
gers and sequelae attend a normal function?
Again, parents always have the fear that
tuberculosis, summer diarrhoea, infantile
paralysis and other diseases will claim their
children. Why should all this be?
The question is, are we going to take this
menace lying down? We did not take the
German menace lying down, but spent 60,000
lives, much misery, and hundreds of millions
of money to keep ourselves free of foreign
domination. Yet we take disease domination
as “natural” ; we blindly accept it as part
of our heritage. It is neither. Disease
could be almost stamped out had we the
necessary knowledge and courage to do it.
There is no doubt whatever that great strides
in this direction could be made by the spend-
ing of one-thousandth part of what we spent
on the German menace in a single year. A
well-equipped institute of medical research,
well staffed, could easily be set up and main-
tained for the sum. But until the people of
this country demand, and make it very defi-
nitely known that they intend to have, such
an institute to investigate these enemies in
our midst, our rulers will probably shelve
the matter.
To get down to detail, what do we want
to set the whole work going? We have the
buildings and machinery at our universities,
and we have the men working at them, well
trained both at home and abroad, and many
of them specially well suited for the investi-
gation of medical problems. Then, why do
they not produce more results? Because they
are so weighed down by the. teaching of
junior students, by administrative work and
by the lack of apparatus that it is impossible
to produce the results we have a right to
expect of them. Yet these men —and I speak
from a personal knowledge of them—are, in
spite of these disabilities, quietly working
away, and slowly producing some excellent
results, but only at the cost of much night
work and giving up their Saturdays and their
Sundays to the task to which they have
put their hands. They do it because they
love! it. But the point is that the taxpayers
are not getting the best results for their
money. Why pay a professor’s salary to a
man to teach junior students, to sit on in-
numerable boards and councils to work out
all the technical details of his experimental
work, all of which takes up so much time,
and could be done by a senior student? To
produce the maximum of results for the
money, -these trained men, men of proved
worth, should be entirely freed from teach-
ing and from as much administration as pos-
sible, and should be left free to plan out
and direct the work, the details of which
would be done by juniors, who would then
receive the finest of all trainings to carry
on the same work themselves.
Three things are wanted: —
(1) A sufficient salary to attract the best
men, otherwise the best men drift into pri-
vate practice, where they can make much
more than in any university or research
work. Of course the true research man
does not work for the sake of his salary,
but because he loves the work; but even his
woi’k is spoiled if he is continually worried
about his financial affairs, the education of


his children, and giving Iris wife a chance
to hold her own in the society in which by
virtue of her position she mixes, and he
wants a little extra for the rainy day and
the twilight. If he gives up a lucrative occu-
pation in the service of humanity he de-
serves at least that much.
(2) Sufficient money for the purchase of
apparatus and the equipment of a library.
Without these research work is impossible.
The ingenious man can often make much
of his own apparatus; but it is pretty sicken-
ing, after he has published some good thing,
to find that it was all done previously by
someone else. In Australia we suffer parti-
cularly badly in this way because of our
remoteness.
(3) That our directors of research shall
travel abroad every five or six years, and
see what is going on in other countries.
Exchange of thought, the stimulation of new
ideas thus gained, the learning of new and
improved methods —all are essential if our
meni are not to go back to a scientific stone-
age compared with men abroad.
Whence is all this money to come? Un-
doubtedly the Governments should pay part
of the cost, but Governments move slowly,
and only when forced to do so. In
other lands men of wealth have learned
to realise that they owe a duty to their
country and to their fellow-men, and part
of tlicir incomes is given every year for
the purposes of research, medical and other-
wise. That is why America and England
lead the world —and we, the vanguard of
Democracy, are miles behind. Are our uni-
versities merely for the purpose of teaching
somebody’s son to make more money than
he otherwise would do? We are a poor-
spirited race if that is our view. A univer-
sity’s first function is the increase of know-
ledge. If our Australian universities are
failing in their first duty it is the people’s
duty to know why. I have given the reasons.
It is the people’s duty to see that this is
changed. The matter lies in the hands of
the people, particularly those of wealth, posi-
tion and influence. Will they help to fight
the menace of disease or continue to suffer
and die needlessly?
M. D.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Verdict.
It is 11 years since the Political Labor
people won a Federal election, and, unless
they cleanse themselves or the other side
makes a hash of things, it will be 11 years
before they win another. Indeed, if they
don’t knock the Moscow planks out of their
platform, and dig up a proper defence policy,
and convince the people that they can be trusted
to stand up for the essential interests of
the nation when those interests clash with
the caprices or malignity of imported work-
stoppers, they may never win another. It
is going to be difficult always for a class
party to capture the Commonwealth Par-
liament, even though it succeeds in getting
control of some of the State Legislatures;
but the feat will be next to impossible while
the class party cannot be relied upon to
prevent industries being lawlessly held up by
swelled-headed union officials who have been
to or communicated with Moscow, or to pro-
tect law-abiding and industrious members of
its own class. Laborites will also have to get
rid of their curious belief in the political
efficacy of the muckrake. The muckrake is
a poor substitute for a policy, and as a
device for blinding the electors to the com-
munist features of the Labor platform and
the party’s championship of communist
strikes it proved a miserable failure, especi-
ally in N. S. Wales. In that State Labor
muckrakers thought to retain the Barton
electorate by alleging infamous things
against Ley, the Ministerial candidate, in
connection with the Puddifoot case. They
reckoned on ousting Bowse, the Minister of
Health, in Calare, by asserting that he
was criminally biased against the Spaii-
linger treatment, and expected that State
Premier Lang’s daily “charges” against
Bruce would complete the rout of Manning
in Macquarie, Killen in Itiverina and
Johnson in Lang. In point of fact Ley t
converted a 1922 minority of 3521 into a
majority of several hundreds; Johnson
doubled his majority; Howse nearly trebled
his; and Riverina was comfortably held.
In the other States none of the great vic-
tories so confidently proclaimed beforehand
were won; on the contrary, a few losses
were made. That Labor polled even as
well as it did is a very remarkable tribute
to the loyalty of tens of thousands of its
supporters who have been shaking heads
over their leaders’ blunders. “You put a
great strain upon our loyalty by requiring
us to vote for such as Donald Grant.” an
old Laborite wrote to one of the heads of
his party the other day; and a repetition
of the strain will inevitably lead to far more
breakaways than Saturday’s election dis-
closed.

The Prohibitionist in Maoriland and
Elsewhere.
The Prohibitionists have once more failed
to vote Maoriland dry, but they polled much
better beyond the Tasman than they have
done of late years in the Commonwealth. In
Westralia on April 4 last Prohibition was
defeated by 77,113 votes to 41,362; in
Queensland on October 6 two years ago
232.191 electors were for continuance and
143,312 for prohibition; in Victoria on
October 21, 1920, continuance won by
314,732 (36,025 reduction votes included)
to 212,254. By contrast, no-license has
headed continuance at the last three Maori-
land licensing polls, results of which arc
subjoined:—
1919. 1922. 1925
Continuance .. ... 241,251 282,669 278,837
State purchase and control 32,261 35,727 52,572
Prohibition .. . . 270,250 300,791 301,308
When none of the three issues secures a
minimum of half the votes cast, continuance
is deemed to have been carried. In 1919 the
Prohibitionists got within 1631 votes of the
requisite 50 p.c., but they were 8803 short
in 1922 and 15.051 on November 4. They
angrily declare that Bung would have been
wiped out six years ago, and that without
compensation, but for the “intrusion” of
the State-control issue, and are going to
move heaven and earth to get the obnoxious
thing dropped, or retained subject to the
condition of a compulsory second vote for
one of the other issues. They have in mind
the fact that in Queensland two years ago
7237 supporters of State management easj
alternative votes for prohibition and 9385
for continuance. But in view of the in-
creased support for State control, and of
the financial possibilities thereof —so attrac-
tive to needy Treasurers —they are unlikely
to catch the Coates Government in an
obliging mood. The Government is more
likely to agree with the wets that three years
is too short an interval between Prohibi-
tion polls. In Westralia, where the “trade”
has had time compensation, the interval is
five years, and in Victoria it is eight years.

The British-Australian Fascisti.
“Bildad” : “Principal British and Irish Soci-
eties and Institutions” cover 24 pages of
Whitaker’s Almanac. Among them, and
ranking in the matter of intense respecta-
bility alongside the Royal Academy, the
Freemasons and the Law Association, is the
British Fascisti, with an official address, and
for president a retired general of many ex-
periences and decorations. The Tize of the
organisation is not known, but it is under-
stood to be large and continually expanding.
Its arrival in Australia is a good sign, and if
it takes permanent root here and expands con-
tinuously it should tend to do much good and
discourage much blatant villainy. There are
points about any organisation which will
bring together, and keep together, a solid
force of anti-Communists, so that they will
know themselves and each other, and in the
process get a better knowledge of the enemy
also. Australia has a negligible army and
few police, and its worst imported characters
hope that these may be brushed aside in some
moment of excitement. There is no National
Guard or Territorial Army. The hope of the
people who run the Moscow show here is that
the Communist objective, which is now on
the programme as the Labor objective, and is
otherwise known as the Red objective, and is
the objective which the Langs and McTier-
nans have accepted as the only way to
office, may arrive on a sudden as it did in Red
Russia. The essential point is that the State
is to take over “the means of industry, pro-
duction, distribution and exchange.” In fact,
the State is to become owner of everything
fixed and movable, including money, jewels,
furniture, books and whatever else the State
desires, or whatever its self-appointed
trustees desire. So there is in view a picture
of loot, lasting all through the rosy first days
of “socialisation,” like the plunder qf Rome
by Goths or Vandals. It is the picture of
multitudinous bands of “patriots,” going
through the houses and other premises which
look as if appreciable quantities of the State’s
valuable property might be within, to collect
the same witli incivility and take it to
State headquarters for safe-keeping. The
fascination of the “socialisation” programme
for criminal minds lies in the prospect of a
vast legalised orgy in the process of trans-
ferring, in a violent amateur way, “the means
of industry, production, distribution and ex-
change,” and all the criminals expect to be
prominent leaders and highly rumunerated
agents in the transfer. Fascism is. a method
for organising a- strong but inconspicuous
counter-force, from which an army may be
recruited to preserve civilisation should the
existing forces fail. It is an eminently peace-
ful institution if the peace isn’t interfered
with. It doesn’t propose to upset anything,
though it aims at putting things upright again
if illegally upset by other people. And though
it intends to be ready, and very much ready,
if criminal lunatics make its services neces-
sary, it is quite willing to be left to quiet
pursuits, such as landscape gardening, varied
with a little rifle practice.

The Powers of Second Chambers.
Apparently the lesson administered by the
Lyons Government to the Speck’s Uppish
House in connection with the 1924 Appro-
priation Bill has not been forgotten. This
year’s Appropriation got through almost
without a scratch, the Most Elderly Gentle-
men accepting the view of the Least Elderly
Gentlemen of the Chamber that, as there
had been a general election since last year’s
constitutional dispute, and as the electors
had endorsed Premier Lyons’s attitude by
giving him a majority, it would be inadvis-
able for the Chamber to insist further upon
its right to amend money bills. But that
the Council still adheres to its ancient power
of veto is evident from its recent rejection
of the Government’s proposal to set the un-
employed to work on the West Coast road.
It is apparently presumed that the Last
Say Chamber’s power to reject a money
bill is absolute, whatever may be the con-
stitutional position in regard to merely
amending such a measure. This view seems
to be accepted by the leaders of both Houses,
though why Ministers who last year utterly
ignored the Council’s amendment of the
Appropriation Bill, and took the responsi-
bility of advising the Governor to assent to
the measure as it passed the Assembly, should
this year admit that the Council has any
constitutional powers whatever where money
bills are concerned is not too clear. Sup
porters of the Leg. Council and all its tradi-
tional powers of veto not unnaturally regard
the present unbelligerent attitude of Minis-
ters as an indication that certain high legal
opinions lately obtained as to the consti-
tutionality of last year’s tactics in regard
to the Appropriation and Taxation Bills
have filled the Government with misgivings
as to the probable outcome of a
threatened action at law to test the
validity of measures passed by the
Governor and one House, and that Pre-
mier Lyons is seeking a quiet and inexpen-
sive way out of the trouble. That there
may be something stronger than mere rumor
behind the assumption is deducible from the
fact that the Government lias announced its
intention of joining with the Upper House
in a memorial to the British Government
praying for a Privy Council ruling as to
the respective powers of the two Houses.
For these reasons and others that may be
expected to appear later the Speck’s Leg.
Council, like that of the Lang State, will
linger longer yet.
The Worst Is Feared.
One of the minor miseries of life is the
strange conception which that gruff diamond,
N. S. Wales Premier Lang (if he is not a
diamond he may at least be a cat’s-eye),
has of his office and dignity. He apparently
considers it his duty once every day to dis-
cover something dreadful and unexpected
about some opponent—a mare’s nest with
the mare busy sitting on the eggs, a fish
story, serious defalcation, secret door, some
mangled remains, or possibly the skeleton of
a red herring. A recent effort was to the effect
that he had been informed that there was
something murkily suspicious about the flota-
tion of the last big Federal loan. His source
of information, he said, was “no less an
authority than Sir Arthur Cocks,” the N. S.
Wales Treasurer whose finance Lang prac-
tically declared to be fraudulent,, and who
was manoeuvred out of the Agent-General-
ship on tlia plea that he was no good at all.
As that treatment would naturally make
Cocks friendly and chatty, he is alleged
to have entered into confidential communi-
cation (which must have been by letter or
wire) on the subject of Federal finance,
which wasn’t his business, with Lang,
whose business it wasn’t either. The sugges-
tion which the amateur detective of Auburn
apparently sees in the confidential chat of
the man he was busy kicking downstairs is
that people were simply bombarding the
Bruce-Page people with money in London,
but they wouldn’t take it, as somebody in
New York offered them a bigger rake-off.
Even in New York they could have done
better than they did for the country—that
is to say, they could have got the loan on
better terms- —but it was more profitable to
them personally, or to somebody else un-
specified, to take the dear money than the
cheap. If Lang’s long, dark story means
anything it means just that. Exactly why
the people who were prepared to pay more
for the loan in N’York didn’t buy the stock
when it was put on the market isn’t men-
tioned ; as a matter of fact the N’York syn-
dicate' which floated the loan presently dis-
solved “through lack of support,” which
makes Lang’s fish story of. millions and mil-
lions waiting to offer themselves on better
terms look as stupid as most of Private-
detective Lang’s dreadful discoveries have
proved to be. Nevertheless, speaking as a
gentleman ostensibly in the real-estate line,
he has requested the Federal Prime Minister
and Treasurer to explain “the ugly appear-
ance” of the spooks, though he didn’t
exactly threaten them, after the manner of
Senator Gardiner, with trial and deporta-
tion. The connection, if any, between the
alleged mystery and the cornsacks deal or
the attack by masked pirates on the office
of a Labor paper, or the reported raid on
the house of Tom Walsii, hasn’t yet tran-
spired ; but the footmarks of the same devil
will no doubt be found in all the places.

The Arabian Knights’ Entertainment.
Dear Bulletin, —Two knights, whose words
were reported in the S. M. Herald last
week, made me wild, and, like Jonah when
his umbrella was eaten by a worm, I did
well to boil over. The pair were Arthur
Rickard and Joseph Carruthers, and
these are some of their words:—
Knight Rickakd : The local communists, who con-
trol the Labor Council of New South Wales,
announced in their yearly report for 1924 that “the
good old times of playing at politics are gone.”
They say “revolution has stepped upon the stage”
.... Now, our manual workers in Australia are.
speaking generally, of moderate education, and are
certainly more intelligent and better informed than
the workers of any other civilised country.
Knight Carruthers: To all Australians the name
and memory of Captain James Cook should be
sacred. It was by Cook's discovery of Australia in
1770, and by his planting of the flag of possession
at Kurnell, that the great island continent became
a British possession.
As regards the cliirrupy talc of the first
knight, it is much more likely that Bol-
shevism selected Australia as a point of
attack upon the British Empire because it
considered Australians as persons of super-
ficial information and abundant credulity,
fickle, and easily led by appeals; also as
slovenly managers of their own affairs, and
therefore the kind of people to have affairs?
taken out of their hands by vigorous char-
latans. As regards the standard of know-
ledge, the demand for and the supply oi
higher education is not large as compared
with a number of countries. Compared with
some it is very deficient. And as regards
the standard of intelligence, it is hard to
name another country where the political
Labor movement is stronger, and where im-
ported Communism is allowed to take pos-
session of it more arrogantly and with more
impunity. It might be well if this aspect of
the subject was mentioned oftener to the
“manual worker,” who is now too much
puffed up with the idea that his kickable
subservience to imported revolutionaries
proves him to be the prize mental exhibit
of the globe. The secoiui Arabian Knight’s
entertainment has a bearing on the first.
Cook, despite his merits, didn’t discover Aus-
tralia. lie didn’t even visit a place of that
name, the shore he surveyed being “the east-
ern coast of New Holland.” He was some 125
years too late to be the first definitely prov-
able white man to take a look at Tasmania
and Maoriland, and much too late to
name them. His “planting of the .flag” didn’t
really make Australia a British ’possession.
Plenty of flags were on this continent before
Cook’s, and plenty of flags were planted by
Cook and others in plenty of places with-
out possession resulting. The man who
hoisted the bit of rag which counted, because
he followed it up by occupation, was the
cocked-liat who brought out the First Fleet.
That Fleeting Show was sordid enough, but
at least it secured the country and it dis-
covered that Port Jackson was a harbor.
The Australian’s apparent inability to assi-
milate a few simple facts of liis early his-
tory, as people of other nations do, make him
look a rare specimen of backwardness rather
than the marvel of intelligence that his flat-
terers tell him lie is.—Yours, etc., J.E.

Jim and His New Boss.
If any man wishes to put in a little practice
for the job of uncrowned Czar or commu-
nistic Shah he should contrive to get a billet
under the N.S.W. Rural Workers’ Accom-
modation Act, if it ever comes into force.
For preference he should get appointed to a
district where the men on the land are
struggling and barely able to maintain them-
selves. The bill provides for accommoda-
tion far better than many a farmer has
been able to provide for himself, and leaves
the power of ordering what is required to
the discretion of the inspector. Thus, when
Jim on his new selection, with heavy bush
all round him and a prospect of 10 years of
tremendous struggle before he sees any ad-
equate return and 20 years before he gets •
what he has earned, decides to employ a
couple of men to speed up the first stage of
his job, lie must first of all start building
accommodation for his workers. His own
tent in the scrub may seem satisfactory
enough to himself; but he must provide
two rooms for his helpers—one for cooking
and the other to sleep in—and the rooms
must meet the requirements of the inspector.
A kerosene-tin and an occasional visit to a
waterhole may satisfy Jim’s own notions
of cleanliness; but the inspector can order
him to put in a bath and a water service for
the men. Jim has never thought of any
sanitary arrangements ; but the inspector can
order those too. though many of the existing
townships are without them and some big
towns are restricted to the most primitive
systems. The inspector can do a lot of
other things. He can order Jim to drive
him about to see that things are .to his
satisfaction, and he can find a fault and
cause trouble without the least difficulty
whenever he wants,to. For instance, when
Jim pays the men off and they leave their
apartments—they are supposed to keep them
clean, but .Tim would have his work cut out
to enforce that —the employer must creep
out from his ragged tent and disinfect the
building. What Jim doesn’t know about dis-
infecting would fill several volumes; and if
the inspector doesn’t like .Tim there can
easily be trouble. In fact, the matter of
liking Jim is the key of the whole situation :
for the inspector has arbitrary power and
his say-so is expected to go. How, then,
can Jim win the affection of the inspector?
It is quite clear that under certain circum-
stances the inspector may declare an open
space in the bush with only the slenderest
amount of improvement to be two rooms
under the Act, that he may consider the.
rain of Heaven a water supply and a tin
dish a bath; while, as for disinfection, he
may easily be persuaded that the scent of
eucalyptus leaves is the best disinfectant in
the world. All these things the inspector

Here, where seven years ago the pride of
peace,
Won at the bayonet’s point, had? moved bis so
We hammered sounding tin anfcl paused to
blow
Strange trumpets for the hate yve deemed
should cease,
We stand in wonder. Haggling yelars in-
crease
The discord more than that wild hour might
know
When clamorous joy was maddened! in the
glow
Of greater lights than shone on Rome and
Greece.
We dreamed so greatly that we wonder still,
Looking at red Damascus and the v/hite
Sad face c*f Russia, while the serpefnt hiss
Of Europe sounds above the broken will
Of nations that fell roaring in tlietr might.
Seven years ago our throats were hoarse for
this !

France, with a dripping sword in each
strained hand,
Pleads penury, her tongue within her cheek,
While statesmen, fumbling for the word,
still seek
Some magic formula to lift the land.
Unhappily the little nations stand
Raging at fancies; yet with hands so weak
They cau but face a future harsh and bleak:,
Waiting the chance to lire the smoking
brand.
Slowly the arch-foe rises from the dust
Where once she sprawled, scarce wouaided
save by shame;
And smiles of a half-triumph light her eyes.
The guns are silent and the eating rust
Gathers about the hard-fought battle’s name;
But cankerous days grow heavy with long
sighs'.

Have we gained peace or but a short respite
For breathing and wound-healing ere the
call
Rings to nciv Armageddons and the fall
Of ocean tears of sorrow in the night V
Look up! The harvests of the world are
white,
The grapes in cluster ripen by the wall,
And grim men, mouthing of the eacli-for-all,
Sharpen a secret dagger with delight.
Yet of the sad years this our souls have
gained,
When the chaff blows from off the threshing-
floor,
Swept by strong airs under a clearer sun —
A sense of deeper things that have remained
Past all contamination and a door
Wide open to) the truth we dare not shun.

The whole world flutters like a bird that
fears, ( .
Knowing how weak the feathers at its breast,
How precious dear the treasure in its nest
And how the one black hawk that turns
and veers
High up among the sunlight’s golden spears
Holds the destruction of all peace and rest
In its curved talons. Dreaming of the best,
Earth trembles for the evil sound she hears.
But there is singing in the yellow corn ;
And the blue day goes by on dancing feet
Leading a laughing child in either hand.
Perhaps an armistice is signed this morn
With old grey Fate and o’er the mercy-seat
Of grander years a rainbow bridge is
spanned.

may do if he loves Jim ; and the theory of
the measure seems to be that if JiM> loves
the inspector’s bosses in politics he will find
the direct road to the autocrat’s heart. That
is where the true Bolshevik element in the
scheme comes in and why the little Czar-
dom of such an inspectorship may be a
splendid training for a future Trotsky.
But in a general way, as a scheme to hamper
settlement, the whole business seems to
deserve first prize. Where large bodies of
men are employed suitable housing provision
should be made ; but where only a couple of
men are put on for a temporary purpose,
such as helping Jim to clear his selection,
the scheme is bad for both employer and
employed. Jim will keep out iof the clutches
of that inspector as long as he can; and the

good work beside him will tramp the roads.

Until 8 p.m. last Saturday the Federal
Labor party regarded 1917 as its black year;
it is now wondering in a dazed way whether
1925 is any less calamitous. At the war
election it won 22 of the 75 seats in the
House of Reps, and failed to return a single
Senate candidate. On the present occasion
it cannot get more than 25 seats in the
House of Reps, and belated returns may re-
duce the number ; and it has only an outside
chance of capturing even a couple of Senate
seats. And there are 22 Senators to be
elected this year. Yet the party was confi-
dent as never before. Mr. Charlton rarely
spoke without predicting that he would have
a good majority in each House, and the re-
ports of liis campaign secretaries simply
radiated optimism. In N. S. Wales it was
given out that Labor would positively wrest
Macquarie from Manning, Calare from
Howse, Lang from Johnson, and Riverina
from Killen, and might gain Richmond and
Eden-Monaro as well, besides retaining the
13 seats it held in the last Parliament. As a
matter of fact, the threatened Ministerialists
are sure to be returned, in most cases by
largely increased majorities; on the other
hand, Laborites McDonald and Cunning-
ham seem definitely beaten in Barton and
Gwydir respectively, while Moloney in
Hume and Riley in South Sydney (the latter
polled 17,056 to his opponent’s 9898 even in
1917) had very close calls. In Victoria
Labor announced the impending capture of
Bendigo, Corio, Corangamite and Indi;
“Balaclava,” it said in an inspired com-
munication, “is the only safe anti-Labor
seat.” Again the Ministerial electorates
alleged to be in danger were easily held, and
Wannon was captured from the Opposition
by several thousand votes. In Queensland,
where Charles McDonald, Labor M.H.R.
for Kennedy since 1901, died a few hours
before polling-day, it seemed possible at one
stage of the count that the Opposition would
lose everywhere, instead of gaining Her-
bert, Brisbane, Oxley and Maranoa, as
was boastfully anticipated. In the result
Forde may retain Capricornia and Theo-
dore scramble in for Herbert, but two seats
out of nine, leaving Kennedy out of the
argument, is nothing to be proud of, seeing
that a State Labor Government has been in
office since 1915. In South Aus. the
Charlton party made a very poor showing
in Boothby, which it expected to regain,
and looks like losing Joel Moses Gabb in
Angas; in Westralia it was donkey-
licked in four of the five constituencies,
and its “Texas” Green is having the
fight of his life in Kalgoorlie; and
in Tasmania it received the full force of
the “shock” which Mr. Charlton gleefully
predicted for the Ministerialists on his re-
turn from the WALSH-plagued islet. The
Nat-Cockies held Bass, Darwin, Franklin
and Wilmot by impressive majorities, and
their John Gellibrand, of the A.1.F., won
Denison from veteran Dave O’Keefe. As
for the Senate, the Labor candidates are
many thousands of votes behind in all the
States; there is a possibility that cross-
voting on the other side may give them seats
in South Aus. and the Speck, but it is a
remote possibility at best. The party began
the election with nine 1922-28 Senators (if
Ogden can be reckoned among them), and
hoped at the very least to get control of the
States’ House and force a double dissolution
should it fail of a majority in the House
of Reps. As things have turned out, it
will be in a minority in the Senate for two
more Parliaments, even in the unlikely event
of a Labor Government being returned three
years hence. In 1925, as in 1917, Labor
forgot Australia. But Australia didn’t
forget.

A good Australian writes from a sanatorium
in Switzerland:—
“F.T.K.” (B. 20/8/25) apparently is full of high
hopes as regards Spahlinger. In London I met
several admirers of the man from Geneva, and I
have been in Switzerland since May last, making
the “cure.” (Not the Spahlinger one.) His most
enthusiastic admirers and patients all say the same
thing—it is impossible to pin him down. A large
part of the profession is quite willing to be con-
vi need, but lie will not show his hand. He is be-
sieged with eager patients and it is almost impos-
sible to get his sera or vaccines. Incidentally, our
own climate is as good as any in the world for
tubercle. What we really need is not the miracle-
working “cure,” but sanatoria and helio-therapeutic
institutes modelled on English and Continental lines.
There is no doubt of the inherent curability of the
majority of cases of tubercle, but it is really time
to give up chasing rainbows. Especially does one
get fed up of this eternal fishing for Spahlinger in
view of the fact that other unspectacular methods
are crying for trial—and some of them for funds.
For instance, the Sanocrysin treatment, at Copen-
hagen, is said to be successful in selected cases; and
there is no secret about it. Investigation in that
direction promises better than in the Spahlinger
direction at present.

“Borom” : The Lang Government could give
the State no worse advertisement in scientific
circles than by its decision to close the N. S.
Wales Observatory on the score of economy.
The science of astronomy, which has a very
real utility as well as an academic interest,
depends largely on the collecting and co-
ordinating of data from every possible
quarter of the globe. The disappearance of
the Sydney institution, which had earned
distinction by useful work, will leave a gap
which will not be easy to fill, and will also

have the effect of disorganising work that is
being carried on elsewhere. Quite apart
from this, and the fact that the Sydney
Observatory had been allotted a certain por-
tion of the gigantic task of completing an
astrographical chart of the heavens, the twin
science of meteorology and weather-forecast-
ing depends to a large extent on the receipt
of up-to-date astronomical information. The
Labor view, apparently, is that the State
cannot afford an observatory; actually, it
cannot afford to be without one.
American law journals now to hand put the
issues in the Tennessee (State of) v. Scopes
case more lucidly than the cables did. The
law of Tennessee, like the law in the Aus-
tralian States relating to public instruction,
deals with secular education only. All forms
of religious instruction in its State Univer-
sities and schools are forbidden. In addi-
tion the State has a law providing that “it
shall be unlawful for any teacher in any
of the universities, normals, and all other
public schools of the State which are sup-
ported in whole or in part by the public
funds of the State to teach any theory that
denies the divine creation of man as taught
in the Bible, and to teach instead that man
has descended from a tower order of
animals.” The defence of teacher Scopes,
who had propounded the principles of evo-
lution to his pupils, was threefold. First,
he contended that the Act penalised one
class of the community, namely, teachers, in
a way not applied to other classes, and thus
violated the constitutional principle that all
citizens are born free and equal. Also that
it penalised one form of religious belief as
distinguished from another and imposed re-
strictions on the freedom of that belief. The
Judge held that teachers, as a class, were
not penalised ; they were at liberty to teach
their views elsewhere than in the State
schools. There was no inequality between
one form of religion and another, since all
religious teaching was forbidden. But the
crux of the matter is whether the theory of
evolution is merely a biological doctrine quite
removed from the sphere of religion, or does
it go to the fundamentals of Christian belief?
If the latter, then it is a subject matter of
religion the teaching of which in State
schools is prohibited by law in Australia no
less than Tennessee.
In the year that Cheops commenced build-
ing his first pyramid at Ghizeh, the father
of a family was taken by a shark while
fishing in the surf off Palm Beach, Barren-
joey (N.S.W.). His women watching on
the shore raised a cry of lamentation for
the loss of their sustaining prop, but another
member of the tribe cast a cold, curious eye
on the proceedings. During the subsequent
mourning ceremonies, while the women
gashed themselves with shells, he squatted
on a flat rock in the near-by bush commit-
ting his impression of the tragedy to stone.
That, at any rate, is a reasonable interpre-
tation of the origin of the great carved fish
with the struggling human figure in its belly
which the late H. A. Wilshire discovered
many years ago in the locality mentioned.
Recently some white Cro-Magnon has “im-
proved” the sculpture with some obscene
additions of his own. The same fate has
befallen the examples just inside the main
entrance to Kuringai Chase. Dr. Basedow.
the S. Australian anthropologist who should
have been appointed to the new chair in
Sydney Uni. the other day, states that some
of the abos.’ masterpieces are over 20,000
years old, the patina which covers them re-
quiring as long as that to form. It is piti-
able that Australia’s only antiquities should
he disappearing together with the last de-
scendants of their makers, and that less is
done to preserve them than to spoil them.

If the Persians are to be regarded as a
European race—and there is no doubt about
the European kinship of those who founded
the State —the vitality which the country has
always shown is a curious tribute to the
stamina of the white man. Only China,
among all the millions of the big continent,
has succeeded in so many directions; and as
matters stand to-day, Persia looks in some
ways healthier than China. The lighting
tribes of herdsmen and rude agriculturists
who federated under Cyrus and made an
alliance with the Modes leaped almost at'
once to power. Even at Plataea, when the
Persian hopes of European conquest were
finally overthrown, there was nothing to be
said against the real Persians in the great
army. The long spear, the brass shield and
armor and the greater height and reach
of the Spartans turned the fight: but on all
accounts it was a near thing. Even Alex-
ander thought much of the Persians, enough
to adopt their dress and some of their cus-
toms ; and when the Syrian Empire faded
and the Parthian dominion wore itself out,
Persia rose again to a strength which defied
the might of Rome during the whole period
of her empire. Eater a raging Tartar host
swept across its borders and brought every-
thing down in blood and dust. But Persia,
stood up again, and, still battling bravely,
outlasted all the Tartar power. Meantime
it had produced its poets, its carpet-weaving
industry and ceramic art—things that en-
throne its people far above the Turks and
Tartars, who fought well and did little else.
Within recent years there have been signs
of considerable vitality in the old nation,
which is the only surviving world-conqueror
among all those who battled for the Eu-
phrates valley and the possession of Asia
Minor and Egypt. Egypt is a sick cotton
field, Assyria a name, Babylon a heap of
rubbish in the desert. Macedonia a few
angry peasants under Greek and Bulgarian
dominion; but Persia has just deposed a
monarch for not attending to his job, and
told the Prime Minister to carry on. It
looks as if the European blood, strained
as it is through all the dust-storms of 24
centuries, had more useful energy than any
of its Asiatic competitors.

“Sisyphus Sadman” : Granted that the
Little Sisters Home at Northcote (B.
29/10/’25) is a worthy charity conducted
by saintly women. Great honor to them!
But the home is no exception to the common
rule of imperfection. Much of what
“Temsee” has written applies with equal
force to this as to other “twilight homes”
throughout Victoria. Like the State refuges,
it derives a very large annual income from
donations, legacies and subscriptions in cash
and goods. Unlike others, it does not re-
ceive State aid, nor does it allow any of its
clients to draw the old-age or invalid pension.
This last provision may or may not be a
laudable one. Opinions differ on this. There
is a singular unanimity, though, on the njpt-
ter of a balance-sheet, and the wonder is why
these good sisters withhold from subscribers
all information regarding financial matters —
where the money goes and whence it comes.
It is quite possible there are in the home some
(or perhaps all) of the types enumerated by
“R.H.” But under the same roof there
are morons, ex-gaolbirds, syphilitics, imbe-
ciles, methylated-spirit addicts, and the
various other human derelicts referred to by
“Temsee.” Rising about 5.30 a.m., these
old folk trudge off to Mass at 6.80, and
religious exercises are continued throughout
the day at various hours —sometimes five ser-
vices in one day. Prayers are not the only
utterances at these assemblies. One well-
known man on the Inky Way has stated in
the Tribune that there is a French chef.
There are others who are certainly neither
French nor chefs, and it is to be hoped that
in the future some endeavor will be made to
avoid the practice of boiling together in one
horrible mess the flesh of lamb and pig, calf
and sheep, frankfurter and black-pudding.
The resultant hprror is not only disgusting,
hut provocative of bad language and hepatic
rebellion. “No paid staff here,” says “R.H.”
Quite so. One wonders, though, if a balance-
sheet were published, whether the cost of
trips to France for half a dozen nuns every
year is part of the price paid for working
“unpaid inmates” twelve or fourteen hours
daily for six days out of the seven ?

POLITICAL
POINTS
Before the next Federal election there will
have to be another redistribution of seats.
The Commonwealth orders these matters far
better than some of the States. Its Electoral
Act allows a variation of one-fifth from the
average, more or less; if it goes beyond that,
boundary readjustments must be made.
They have already become necessary, or will
before long, in parts of Victoria, where
Melbourne (46,556) has 18,167 fewer electors
than suburban Henty; in Sydney, where
some of the suburban constituencies have
12,000 to 15,000 more electors than others;
and in Westralia, where Perth has 33,577
electors and rural Swan 44,155.
One of those whom the inevitable redis-
tribution of N.S.W. seats will benefit is T. J.
Ley, whose capture of Barton was the most
spectacular personal achievement of the re-
cent election. Barton contains 55,050 elec-
tors, having put ■on 12,666 in three years;
Cook, the adjoining Labor stronghold, con-
tains 43,115 and has put on only 2149.
When redistribution comes about, Tempe, in
which 4000 or -5000 electors voted nearly
2 to 1 against Ley, will certainly be taken
from Barton and tacked on to Cook. There
is nothing else for it, Tempe being a con-
tinuation of the Cook subdivision of St.
Peters.
Considering that they were burdened with
the feeble Pcai'ce, the Westralian Nat.-
Cockies did very well to retain four of the five
House of Reps, seats for certain and the
three in the Senate. Pearce was supposed
to be their campaign leader, but his idea of
leadership was to whine in suitable places
that he was a good Foreign-trader, and that
Westralia required him in the Cabinet to curb
the Protectionists. The Govei-nment needs
strengthening, especially in the Senate, and
Pearce should be dropped in favor of Massy
Greene, who never poses as a Foreign-trader
and never whines. Other Ministers may
aspire to succeed Watt as Speaker and Givens
as President of the Senate; if so, a place in
the Ministry might be found for Lynch, who
had experience in a Westralian portfolio.
The passing of ex-Speaker Charley Mc-
Donald, original M.H.R. for Kennedy (Q.),
on the morning before polling-day, recalls
the death of Gregor McGregor after nomina-
tions closed for the 1914 Federal election.
Gregor’s name was on the S. Aus. Labor
ticket for the Senate, and as no substitution
could be. made the party had to advise the
faithful to give their sixth vote (there were
six candidates to be elected) to one particular
Liberal, Shannon. The advice was religiously
obeyed, and Labor was so strong in those
days that five Labor Senators went in as well
as Shannon. There being no such thing as
Senate by-elections, nobody expected Shannon
to decline the gift that Fate had thrust
upon him, but there is nothing to prevent
McDonald’s opponent submitting himself to
the electors. It would certainly be the spoil-
ing thing to do.
The best joke of the Federal election in
Queensland was Jack Fihelly’s “Me-and-the-
Pi’ince” letter. Sent out on notepaper bear-
ing the heading “Bi-isbane City Council,”
and decorated with the arms of the city, the
letter was signed in facsimile “J. A.
Filielly, Leader Greater Brisbane” (which
he isn’t). The choicest passage read:
“When the Prince of Wales and General
Birdwood were here as my guests —I was
Acting-Premier at the time—they noted the*
fact, and were always chatting tq me about
our future.” The “fact” was merely that
Brisbane is the port of Southern Queens-
land —but the Prince and Birdie had to be
dragged in somehow. Fihelly often claims
that Edward the Next’s visit—-“when I was
Acting-Premier”—won the 1920 election for
the Queensland Labor party. However, the
“Me-and-tlxe-Prince” missive had no appre-
ciable effect on the Brisbane electors —
Cameron licked Edward’s protege by 3000
votes.
Joseph Gordon Coates, who has just re-
ceived from the Shivery Isles a mandate to
go ahead and “get things done” ( vide his
electioneering ads.) went into Parliament in
1911 as Liberal representative of Kaipara;
but when Massey wanted a bright young
man to take hold of the Post Office, which
was in a bad way, he found that Coates, just
back from the war with a commission as
major and a Military Cross, would be a
popular selection, and Coates was willing.
The fact that he represented a North Auck-
land constituency was a distinct asset, since
the nucleus of Reform power has never been
situated far from the northern end of the
northernmost province. As P.M.G. Coates
rendered satisfactory service, and was then
given Public Works and later Railways. As
administrator of Public Works he made him-
self immensely popular by increasing the
rate of expenditure from two millions a year
to four, six or eight millions, according to
political exigencies. This year the Dominion
lias borrowed five millions in London for
works, and is now raising a local loan of
not less than five millions for advances to
farmers. So long as borrowing and spending
are roads to popularity, Coates can be de-
pended upon to take them.
The M.L. Labor party received a set-back
at the latest elections, losing four seats out
of the 17 gained three years ago. The party
put its foot heavily on the soft pedal during
the recent scrap, said as little as possible
about the socialisation of the means of pro-
duction. distribution and exchange, and talked
about the precession of the equinoxes or the
bombardment of Damascus if anyone men-
tioned the shipping strike. The attempt
to sidestep the trouble was bad business.
The party would have been better advised
la) to condemn the strike as an attack on
trades unionism, or (b) to openly adopt the
upheaval and glory in its Bolshevism. It
did neither, and shared with its comrades in
misfortune of the Nationalist —once Liberal
—party the fate of those who are neither
fish nor fowl nor good red herring.
The latest report from the desolate loan
market of London implies that new borrow-
ing is permitted, but that there must be no
ugly rush, and each State must wait the
signal. Preference is given to the Gold
Coast, which wants £4,500,000. This nigger
colony doesn’t owe much; its railways are
highly profitable; none of the loan money
is wasted on vote-buying schemes, for there
are no votes; and the British Government
CRACKING HARDY.
“Dissatisfied with Mr. Allan, whose ineptitude has been emphasised by numerous adverse votes in the
House, Vic. Nationalists have put it to him that the dignity of the office would best be served by his
voluntarily relinquishing it.”
“Dignity? Blow your dignity! I’m comfortable enough here!”
knows that the interest will come back in
cash, and not in a fresh IOU, for it collects
the money from the nigger itself. After that
the prodigals are to be let in one by one as
may be arranged. They are reported as:
Westralia, £2,500,000; S. Australia,
£1,500,000; Victoria, £4,500,000; Queens-
land, £3,500,000; Tasmania, £600,000; N. S.
Wales, £6,000,000; Maoriland, £5,000,000.
So they are all there. There may be con-
siderable waiting, but meanwhile the prodi-
gals will do their best with overdrafts, pawn-
ing the prospective loans as security.
The men who manufacture evidence for
the communists here seem to be a crude
lot who could hardly forge a brown-paper
bag convincingly. The letter which they
published purporting to be from the Fascisti
in London, and urging the Australian Fas-
eisti to join with the Bruce Government in
deeds of gore and entrails, was below the
worst average. The address of the British
organisation was wrong, so was the tele-
phone number and the name of the man who
ran the show, and the writer even blundered
over the name of the British Chancellor of
the Exchequer, who was dragged in to corro-
borate. Of course, the communists don’t
want a counter-organisation; but that is
not a good reason why there shouldn’t be one.
In fact, it is a good reason why there should
be one, though the name has nothing to
recommend it.
The most surprising feature of the election
results in Victoria was J. 11. Lister’s 5000
majority in Corio, now in large part an in-
dustrial constituency—much more so than
when it used to return Labor members, as it
did in 1910 and 1914. On the other hand,
Tommy Ryan failed to fulfil Age and
Argus predictions that he would get away
with Dave McGrath’s scalp in Ballarat.
Lots of Ballarat people have little use for
McGrath, a vaporing pacifist nowadays, but
the Nationalists will never shift him until
they nominate a good Ballarat man, instead
of importing a candidate from Melbourne, as
has been their custom for ever so long.
Local sentiment is a factor which can never
be ignored anywhere, and it is stronger in
Ballarat than most places.
If Britain had the referendum it might
get out of a serious difficulty. A majority
of the Commons are Protectionist in various
degrees, including a number of Laborites
who have seen the light. There is strong
reason to believe that the country was Pro-
tectionist at the 1924 election, but it got
no chance to say so, for the Conservatives,
rattled by the setback of 1923, sank the fiscal
issue, and promised to leave it under water
till it got a “mandate.” The referendum
would supply the mandate cheaply and defi-
nitely and without upsetting all the political
furniture. But Britain hasn’t got that far
yet. Nor has Australia, though its “ad-
vanced” politicians profess to have been
shouting, to themselves and each other, for
this priceless boon during 35 years or so.
Still, British Protection is in sight, though
it is a pity the visibility isn’t better.
Lloyd George, who leads the British
Liberal remnant of 40, lately made
anew departure. He proposed that
Britain should recognise that its manu-
facturing supremacy is gone, should
stick to the system under which the goue-
ness came about, and raise a new war-cry
of “Back to the Land.” Britain, a little
bigger than Victoria, already lias almost
exactly twice as much land under crop as
the whole Commonwealth, and at the same
time contrives to graze more animals (sheep,
horses, cattle and pigs) than Victoria, Tas-
mania, S. Australia and Westralia combined.
If George can get any more back on the
land it will be a marvel of close packing.
After fighting a rearguard action for 14
years the once-great liberal party of Maori-
land met its Waterloo on November 4. At
the time of its first defeat in 1911 the party
returned 36 members out of 80; in 1914, 33;
in 1919, 18: in 1922, 23; and this year only
11. The Reform party, just re-christened
the Coates party, returns to office with as
large a majority as Seddon was able to boast
in his palmiest days. Liberalism has been
a waning force in the Shivery Isles for
years past, and it lost its last rem-
nants of popularity when it made unsuccess-
ful overtures to the Reformers for a fusion
just before the election. Other factors in
the result were the splendid organisation of
the Reform party, the spending of upwards
of £20,000 on a newspaper-advertising cam-
paign centred on the personality of Coates,
and the uncompromising fashion in which
Coates dealt with the Maoriland sector of
the shipping strike.
After sitting for nine months Vic. Royal
Commission on soldier-settlement lias told
tile Government that the “correctives” it
suggests “are already active parts of the
policy of the Administration,” but that
“more vigor in their execution is desirable.”
The “correctives” are revaluation of some
blocks, new lots for old in certain cases,
apportionment of abandoned holdings among
Diggers with insufficient land, redemption of
implied promises regarding water or drain-
age, funding of arrears, and the discharge
of “misfits.” The Composite Cabinet
will introduce a bill to give effect
to at least some of the recommen-
dations, the most satisfactory part of which
is the recognition that, generally speaking,
farms have been too small. Which, of
course, is merely another way of saying that
it costs even more than bad been expected
to settle people on the land if the idea is
that they shall earn a living.
Without material alteration the Apprentice-
ship Bill was piloted through committee of
Vic. Assembly by Peacock, its author. At
the instance of ex-Treasurer McPherson, the
controlling commission’s personnel was modi-
fied ; it will consist now of three employers,
three employees and an independent chair-
man. Representatives of the Education and
Labor Departments and of technical schools
were deemed superfluous and ruled out. For
20 years legislation to make better provi-
sion for training skilled workers has been
promised, and three commissions have made
recommendations. Now an enactment is in
sight at last.
Queensland will have to wait for another
Parliament to bring its anomalous divorce
law into line with the laws of other States.
The statutory period of desertion is five
years. In the other States (except South
Aus., where there is no divorce for desertion)
the period is three years, and Tasmania
gallantly docks a year for a female petitioner.
Queensland Labor Ministers agree that the
desertion period ought to be reduced to two
years, but they are afraid to stir up a
clamor about “easy divorce” and “increasing
the facilities for sin.”
A few members of the N.S.W. Assembly
refuse to accept the new salary increase, but
not keeping their protest in evidence it does
no good, and people don’t even believe they
have refused. Men with more original ideas
might have collected the increase and paid it
once a month into a Public Debt Sinking Fund
account at the Commonwealth Bank. The
balance-sheet would then advertise their good
deed and the other fellows’ mean one every
year. And they would have the credit of
being the only people trying to reduce the
State’s liability. A general sinking fund is
supposed to be accumulating, but owing to
midnight thieves it is smaller now than it
was 13 years ago.
Circumstances obliged Vic. Premier Allan
to modify his resolution not to close the Leg.
Assembly during the last week of the Com-
monweaitli election campaign. Warde’s death
forced an adjournment of the House on
Wednesday, and as the funeral was on the
Thursday morning it was not considered
worth while to sit for two hours that after-
noon. So many Labor members were away
campaigning on Wednesday that the Oppo-
sition benches were almost empty while a tri-
bute was being paid to Warde. As a quid
pro quo Labor will probably help to push
on with business. It is showing no disposi-
tion to placate the Auk by helping to put
Allan out and Lawson (or McPherson) in.

A drop of 34 p.c. in the loss-rate, a larger
return on investments and an increase in
the volume of business sent the year's net
profits up to £91,546, the biggest yet. And
with that goes out word of a gift distribu-
tion for the eighth successive year, making
(with some previous issues) £275,000 capi-
talised since 1912. In that year the div.
rate receded from 12J to 10 p.c., and has
stayed there ever since; and there is more
profit left over now than there was before
the bonus issue of 10 years ago was made.
You’ve seen a cart-track down a slope turned
first into a rut and then into a watercourse.
Not much flowed that way at first; but as
the gutter deepened the rainfall thereabout
seemed no longer to hesitate about the course
it ought to take. A well-managed insurance
office is like that. Many a cart,, crosses the
plain without making a rut; but when the
right course has been taken —often much a
matter of accident, it seems—the results
are astonishing. Last year divs. called for
only a little over 40 p.c. of the profits, and
after sending £lO,OOO to a pensions fund
and handing £25,000 by way of bonus to
shareholders, there still remained £19,046,
which was rather more than 15 p.c. on the
capital as it stood before the first of the
present series of bonus distributions was
made 10 years ago. Notwithstanding all
the transfers, reserves are still £13,080
greater than capital. As last year’s return
on investments alone was £1968 more than
will be required to pay 10 p.c. on the capi-
tal as increased, that rate of div. seems very
safe. But shareholders will need to have
extraordinary luck if the capitalisations are
continued without a break for many years
longer. With every transfer the amount re-
quired to pay 10 p.c. is greater; the div.
alone now calls for more than a 10 p.c. div.
and a £25,000 bonus did in 1915. The two
now require £62,500; and profits didn’t reach
that figure even in so late a year as 1922.
Marine underwriting was the strong prop
in the co.’s earlier days; later, legislation—
chiefly Workmen’s Compensation Acts—
brought a crop of new premiums into the
field. How business has expanded in the
last 10 years is seen in, these figures:—

While gross premiums grew £30,403 during
the year, re-insurances increased £17,776,
leaving net premiums £12,627 better. But
that must be considered in relation to the
loss and expense ratios. Here are compari-
sons back to 1900 :

An astonishing increase, no doubt; but it
has to be remembered that there has been
an astonishing increase in values during the
past 10 years. And that is a point which
gentlemen who throw bricks at cos., for issu-
ing bonus shares are apt to forget. As a
matter of cold fact, the co. which merely
pays its shareholders the same rate of divi-
dead as it did in 1914, and has not mean-
time issued to them any bonus shares, has
cut down their income by about 7s. in the £.
That is to say, a 10 p.c. div. to-day will
buy a shareholder no more of the things
he needs than a 63 p.c. would in 1914.
The drop in the United’s loss rate last
year benefited underwriting profits by
£13,303, and there was a growth of £3532
in the return from investments:—

Funds over 21 times greater than last year’s
net premium income give policy-holders a
wide margin of protection ; in addition there
is a contingent liability of £5 per share on
80,000 shares. And there need be no un-
easiness over the quality of the assets. At
the close of the accounts 491 p.c. (£450,851)
of the total was in Government securities :
and to meet sundry creditors, including pro-
vision for unexpired losses (£07,461), there
were book debts, cash and deposits totalling
£238,3 iO. Premises were in at £104,281
mortgages £59,767 and debentures £56,056!
The market, which plainly has hopes of fur-
tlier benefits values the scrip cum rights at
±l2 15s. giving a return a shade over 4 p.c.

Last year s increase in trusts amounted to
£939,493, which brings the total within
coo-ee of 10 millions. Although the profit
disclosed was a record, expenditure in con-
nection with alterations to the premises
forced by expanding business was met be-
fore the figure was written in, which pro-
mises well for the present year. The Per-
manent does not collect the corpus commis-
sion until the trust becomes distributable,
which, apart from the advantage to the
estate, lias interest to shareholders, who can
see rich returns in years to come when the
estates representing the large expansion of
recent years are distributed.

Despite the consistent growth of expenses
the directors increased the div. to 8 p.c.,
which is an indication that the future looks
good in their. eyes. Their own funds are
invested in this solid way:—

Reserves have increased by £20,000 in the
past four years, but the Board intends to
build up the total, and the future is largely
governed by that resolve. In the past three
years only a shade over 60 p.c. of the visible
profits have been divided: and though last
year’s div. was increased, it left over 39
p.c. of the earnings in the bag. Sharehold-
ers thus seem assured of a decent return,
which the capitalisation of six years ago
makes even better to old holders.

As all the paid capital £43,820 in £1 shares—
is now held by the Chamber of Manufactures,
a solid sum went to build up that organisa-
tion for the work it does and plans to do.
Established in 1914. following the passage of
the Victorian Workers’ Compensation law,
the co. aimed to conduct manufacturers’ in-
surance at minimum rates, to assist the
Parent organisation to obtain a fitting
home, and generally to strengthen that body
financially. Thus far £40,004 has been paid
in divs. (10 p.c. from the beginning),
£49,388 voted to the Chamber and £202,185
handed to insurers as bonuses. And there
was, in addition, after final appropriations,
£74,000 in a general reserve, £20,000 in a
building reserve and £62,333 put aside as
provision for unexpired risks, this last being
much in excess of the amount usually looked
upon as adequate. Although a building re-
serve is now getting substantial attention,
the parent body has a splendid home in
Flinders-street, which was added to by a
purchase in 1924. Thus far the members
have stood by their co. and they will be
able to do big things if they continue their
allegiance. Naturally the low expense ratio
is the most striking feature: —

had moved down. Funds are invested:
public securities, £132,280; cash, etc.,
£18,323; book debts, £25,108; property,
£99,522. Allowances to policy-holders were
on the same scale as 1924—from 30 p.c. on

on motor-car and -cycle risks.

This is an amalgamation of the remark-
able money-spinner Abermain Collieries,
Ltd., and Seaham Collieries, Ltd. The cos.
came together in October, 1922. paid capital
being fixed at £1,200,000, of which Abermain
got £BOO,OOO (four fully-paids for three in
the old) and Seaham £400,000 (two in the
new for three in the old co.). Seaham share-
holders did not do so badly, for they had less
to offer than Abermain, with its rich mines
on the upper end of the field. Nevertheless,
Seaham had been giving a handsome return
to its shareholders. Abermain took over the
Silkstone Colliery in 1902. For 20 years it
won its coal cheaply and placed its product
at good prices, and divs. within that period
at times touched 15 p.c. p.a. In 1920 its
paid capital was brought up to £200,000,
mine property was written up, and share-
holders found themselves with three fully-
paid shares where previously they had held
one. For that gift they owe kindly thoughts
to W. M. Hughes, then Prime Minister, and
to Judge Edmunds, who was appointed to
bring peace to the coal industry. So far
as the public was concerned, it seemed to
be a peace at any price. Certainly the
miners got high wages and the coal-owners
the right to charge high prices. That other
industries suffered was apparently of no im-
portance. Anyway, the net result was to
send the biggest consumer of' Borehole coal—-
8.11. P. Steelworks —scouring the northern
fields in search of likely areas; and to
strengthen the Victorian demand for the
speeding up of the Yallourn electricity
scheme. Here are balance-sheet movements

Not much information there. The co. finds
no difficulty in disposing of its output. The
absence of any indication of trouble in the
industry is a favorable factor. Investors will
note that the only visible reserves are the
few thousands undistributed. But something
is hidden in the book value of the mines and
equipment.

Allan and Stark, Ltd. (Brisbane), re-
tailers of softgoods, etc., last year made a
net profit of £26,675, after setting aside
£2298 for depreciation. Income had to bear
a non-recurring expense amounting to £1739.
Ordinaries were given 8 p.c., and reserves
lifted to £23,740. The firm lias grown with
Brisbane, the first sale of hairpins by the
founders being an unrecorded part of the his-
tory of 43 years ago. Up to 1919 the con-
cern was private, and even now is largely a
family matter, original holders controlling
nearly two-thirds of the capital. Expansion,
however, is adding new names to the regis-
ter. Despite its age and its record, good-
will does not figure in the balance-sheet.
Capital is £269,200 in 232,625 ordinaries and
38,751 7 p.c. prefs. (£2176 is unpaid). The
report is refreshingly clear, and at each
annual meeting shareholders are given full
information as to the year’s operations. The
premises occupy one of the most valuable
sites in Brisbane, and an ambitious building
programme is being worked out. Ordinary
repairs and maintenance are charged against
revenue, but £1(5,055 was added to premises
and plant during the year, and £7033 written
oft, making £11,213 thus dealt with in the
last two years; £4313 is reserved for further
writing off. The premises now stand in the
books at £118,502, plus £42,234 for plant
and fixtures. The co. has a seventh holding
(2(5,545 £1 shares, in the books at
£20,084) in Stuparts, Ltd., which is doing
a similar trade in Maryborough. Its results
in 1024 were unsatisfactory, and although
a div. of 6 p.c. .was paid last year a com-
plete reorganisation is now in progress, the
effects of which are expected to show in next
accounts. Allan and Stark are making quite
sure: the amount received from the
div. (£3503) was not brought into
account, but was placed aside as a
reserve against its holding. Liabilities
on July. 25 totalled £02,354, trade credi-
tors being £41,212. All outside debts,
however, were easily covered by liquid and
semi-liquid _assets, including £153,060 of
stock and £09,081 of book debts. The future
policy of the co. has been declared to be one
of 8 p.c. divs. and attention to reserves, and
new capital is to be invited on that basis.

That represents a one-in-eight bonus distri-
bution to ordinaries. Needless to say, no
protest was made against the Board’s recom-
mendation. And yet, despite the strong posi-
tion of the co. and the reserve that is in the
written-down value of the fixed assets,
shareholders well might have been less eager.
Prefs. are 8 p.c. cumulative with rights to
30 p.c.; and last year shareholders got the
maximum for the second time. Nobody who
examined the float in 1921 will be surprised;
for one thing, fixed assets were passed over
by the old proprietors at much under their
value. And the business is expanding hand-
somely: The jump in gross profits last year
was from £174,467 to £203,553. Further, the
progress has been accompanied by a very dis-
tinct improvement in balance-sheet figures:

Given a reasonably prosperous year there
should be no difficulty in finding good divs.
The margin of profits beyond divs. has so
far been wide. The demand for made foods
is increasing more rapidly even than the
bloat of the capital cities. Capital on June
30 was £287,334; the gift issue increases it
to £310,752 ; £lOO,OOO is in prefs. The full
div. on the increased capital should, how-
ever, be a simple matter. Goodwill is in at
£30,000, and the reserves, after the bonus
shares have been issued, will amount to only
£20,483 in excess of that figure. The co.
now has factories in four States, and there
is a subsidiary in Maoriland. A recent fire
at the Queensland works did not seriously
delay manufacture.

dare not sail very close to the wind —your
stuff is always liable to be held up some-
where or other. And, of course, the people
—-including Tom Walsh’s working men and
their wives—have to pay for it. The cost
of keeping six months’ stock on the shelves
when three months’ ought to be enough has
to go on to the sale price. That’s how every
disturber of industry bleeds the public. Be-
cause the Mutual Stores’ stocks were heavier
liabilities were also a shade heavier —trad-

£4611 easier. But creditors are thoroughly well
secured: there is a mortgage of £40,000

against other liabilities of £73,179 there are
liquid and semi-liquid assets of a quarter-

of the ordinaries there is a fair though none

Mount Isa Prop, and Mount Isa Mines
have merged at last. It was the only sen-
sible thing to do. The purchase considera-
tion was 6250 fully-paid £2O shares in the
big co. The capital of the Prop, was £65,000
in 260,000 ss. shares. Prop, shareholders
will thus receive one £2O share in Mount Isa
for every 42 shares held; in other words,
each Prop. ss. share gets about 9s. 6d. of Isa
Mines scrip at par. The capital of Mount
Isa Mines, Ltd., is £BOO,OOO in 40,000 shares
of £2O each, of which 24,009 have been
issued, including 3250 shares paid for the
Isa South. Steps are being taken to
subdivide the shares into 20 of £1
each. Everything is now clear for
starting. A London group has agreed to
advance a half-million for treatment plant
and water conservation upon the expendi-
ture of £lOO,OOO on development as from
the beginning of 1924, subject to the opinion
of an expert that the developments justify
the greater expenditure. The £500,000 is
to be advanced against a 7 p.c. debenture issue,
reducible annually over a period of 10 years
after the first unit of the plant is completed.
The group was given an option for two years
over 5000 shares at £lOO each, the proceeds
to go in reduction of the debenture. Those
shareholders who took up the issue of 2500
shares in April last were given an option
over a similar number at par for 12
months. There will be a small cash divi-
dend for Prop, shareholders out of money
in hand.
The merger clarifies the position in regard
to the guarantee against loss to be given to
the State Government for the building of
the railway, and should hasten production.
The big co.’s bore, which has been talked
of for six months past, got a start at the
end of October. It is difficult to see what
necessity *there is to proceed with this since
Prop.’s No. 2 bore showed that the Black
Star-Ibus lode held good to 600 ft. Con-
sidering the iihmense reserves there must
be above this level the time has hardly
arrived to look for more ore below that level.
The Black Rock lode, which has proved the
richest on the field through the carbonate
zone, is being sunk on by winze from the
226 ft. crosscut, and is down to the 250 ft.
mark. The last assay for 3ft. width
in the winze is 40 p.c. lead and 290 z. silver
—great values for primary ore. If it main-
tains these values over the 25ft. thickness
proved above 150 ft. it is going to make its
influence felt in the smelting mixture. A
bore on this lode would be a thing of out-
standing merit, for it shows exceptionally
rich sulphide, and what is wanted now is
to know if it maintains width and values
to 500 ft. or 600 ft. down.

F. G. Brown is the live-wire in the Syd-
ney float of the KoorbOora and Gurrumbah
tin-reefing leases at Herberton (N.Q.). The
100,000 7s. 6d. contribs. found a ready
market, despite the slug of £12,000 in cash
on top of the 80,000 paids which fall to the
promoters. The cash stipulated is £lBOO
three weeks after registration and £750 per
month until paid. About five years ago
Brown bought for £15,000 the leases from
the Irvinebank Co., taking in with him S. C.
Magennis (London), Joe Millican and the
late E. D. Miles. To modernise the reduc-
tion plants they added some £15,000 worth,
but the drop in tin to £l4O soon put the
show out of action. The 100,000 tons mined
was all taken out by hand-drilling. The
plant to be operated will consist of three
units of 10-head qpch, two of which are in
existence and the other arranged for. Each
is well placed for feeding with ore, and the
wmter-supply is first class. A caretaker has
lived on the premises during the suspension
period, and kept the machinery oiled and
white-leaded, so it is estimated that £3OO
will start the plant running, and Brown
figures on crushing ore in January. Dr.
H. I. Jensen is consulting-engineer to the co.,
in which Adelaide has taken a hand with
Sydney.
Queensland Mines Department ’recently
put up a small coke-oven on the Bowen field
for testing the slack coal, which is only an
incubus at present. The coke was all right
except for the ash content, which averaged
18 to 19 p.c. This is too high for Oliil-
lagoe, and so N.S.W. coke is still wanted
for the State smelters. Washing the slack
may be the solution for Bowen, which is the
nearest field to Mt. Isa, and with a good
coke should capture the trade there.

Even Junction North, the poor_relation of
the Broken Hill family, made £25,591 profit
last half-year, bringing the total for the 12
months to £44,855. There is a three- or
four-shilling div. there; but how can it be
paid with a debit at I’, and L. of £120,429?
That big total was piled up between 1920
and 1924, when very little ore was produced
and one of the innumerable reorganisations
of plant was taking place. The Junction North
is in a poor position on the lode, and it is
very doubtful whether it will ever do much
gleaning, as Block 14 and the B. H. Prop,
are able to do. To eke out its own very
scanty ore supplies it some years ago bought
the old Pinnacles Mine; but that isn’t
large, according to Broken Hill standards,
and the product has to stand expensive road-
haulage and handling. Still, with a clean-
ing up of the balance-sheet there is hope of
a few divs. Stores, sundry debtox-s and
bank balance on September 30 stood at well
over £05,000 on a conservative valuation of
stores; and with final payments, etc., there
must be over £75,000 on the right side now.
But of course it is a gamble. Wages and
working conditions at Broken Hill are
naturally fixed according to what the big
mines can stand; and that makes things
very difficult for the poor i-elation.

Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) is still looking
for treasure —in a winze between Nos. 2
and 3 veins. This has been sunk to 59ft.,
the bottom showing big formation of
copper and iron pyrites carrying splashes
of arsenical pyrites, which should be dis-
placed by good ore as work proceeds.”
The West Flagstone (N.S.W.) reports
hitting a new lode 6ft. wide near -the north
boundary, giving 5 p.c. It is in soft ground
and has been followed for 15ft., the trend
being into the next block to the south, owned
by the parent Flagstone Co. _ MacKenzie
reports that the eastern tunnel in the Flag-
stone is 115 ft. in, and that “small rich
patches of ore are continually making in the
face” ; and of course that’s what the detrac-
tors of the field said they expected. The 10-
liead mill has already got well behind schedule
time, the “Christmas div.” having given place
to remarks about February.
* * * *
From a man on the spot:—
Somewhat late in the day Radio directors asked
the mine manager his opinion of their show. The
manager’s reply was a brick: “The mine is prac-
tically worked out to No. 2 level, and between
Nos. 2 and 3 levels there is a height of backs of
only 40ft., although gold values here are good.
From 3 to 4 (bottom) level ore bodies are small and
values erratic, and if dimensions and gold content
do not increase the mine will be no good to the
senders of the belated telegram.” The manager
related only what has been stated more than once
by this Column, and the position is such that no
great credit is reflected on anyone. Shares were
rushed from the issue price (25.), and thousands
were bought between Bs. and 9s. Probably sellers
at these prices will take the view of John Scaddan,
who in similar circumstances found consolation
in believing that such money was not really lost;
it was, he said, still in the pockets of the people.
Promoters were to receive 28,000 reserve shares on
payment of first instalment of £5OOO to vendors
next month, but this little parcel of scrip is likely
to go into the discard. Unfortunate features are
that the steam boiler operating the winder has broken
down, the duty of the mine pump is insufficient, and
the co. has sunk the main shaft only 80ft., whereas
it covenanted to Sink 100. Should the vendors in-
sist on the balance being performed, the directors,
with their faulty shaft-sinking plant, will be set some
hard thinking. Once again let it be said that the
show as a privately-owned concern is a highly
payable proposition, and as such contains well over
£lO,OOO profit in sight. At the same time, in view
of the purchase consideration required, it has not
yet looked a suitable venture for a co.
Last year Associated Northei’n (W.A.)
re-opened its Ora Banda show and started
crushing. It wasn’t very successful and now
the mill has been closed down. Years ago
when costs were lower and there was better
ore to pick for treatment some profits were
made, but now things are different. Still
the management believes that the mine has
unexhausted possibilities and has started to
deepen the shaft, believing that better values
will be found farther down.
* * * *
Golden Hope and Pernatty, relics of the
Hampton Plains boom (W.A.), got into
print the other day. The former’s shareholders
have had to find money from time to time in
order to keep going, and now it looks as if
they will never get anything in return. The
latest report indicates that the show is about
on its last legs and that it would be best
for everyone conceimed if the liquidator was
trailed in. Peruatty has been manned by
tributors for some time. Several small pro-
fitable crushings have been taken ont, but
what remains in the cupboard doesn’t count
for much. At present the co. is looking for
a spectacular option to liven up a paralysed
market.
* * * *
Great Boulder’s hopes of finding some-
thing good on the east side along the Per-
severance boundary have been shattered.
Ounce ore of fair width was worked at
depth by Perseverance tributors up to the
Boulder boundary, and the Boulder co. sank
a shaft 250 ft. in the belief that it would get
some too. But nothing payable was met. In
the absence of fresh developments in other
parts of the old mine the outlook for share-
holders is depressing.
Attempts are being made to liven up
Greenbushes, Westralia's last remaining but
almost dead tinfield. One or two lode
shows have been re-opened on the strength of
promises of Government assistance, and there
is much optimism regarding their future. To
date Greenbushes has produced over a mil-
lion pounds’ worth of tin, but not much of
it during the past few years.
Details made available indicate that
Brown’s Reward Co., of Field's Find
(W.A.), had something solid behind the
claim of a good development. The “fair-
sized crushing” mentioned by this Column
was a parcel of 600 tons, and the yield from
plates and sands was over loz. sdwt. The
co. is down only 100 ft., but the reef, which
was reported by earlier managers and a
Government expert to have pinched out, has
been proved by the present manager to be
a defined body of stone from 6ft. to 9ft. wide,
and this has been stoped for 70ft., with the
reef strong in each end. There appear to
be prospects, given well-spent money and
careful management, of returns to share-
holders.

Managing-director Mick Williams, at the
cost of a trip to Java, succeeded in obtain-
ing a 12 months’ extension of the option held
on six oil concessions in Borneo by a Perth
syndicate. The price of the option is
184,000 cash and 16,000 paid shares; £6OOO
cash has been paid, and a £5OOO instalment
is due next March, leaving £78,000 cash and
16,000 shares to be provided for on settling
day (March 15, 19271. The syndicate is
in 10,000 shares, of which 7000 are issued.
Claude de Bern ales, now doing well in Lon-
don in connection with Wiluna interests, has
been authorised to place the 3000 reserve
shares and prepare London oil investors for
the big float that will be necessary to provide
the cash for purchase, equipment and de-
velopment. Meantime the syndicate proposes
to put some trial bores down 1000 ft. as soon
as funds permit.

The first annual report of Taranaki Oil-
fields, Ltd., shuts off at July 31, and as no
tangible results have accrued since that date,
the chief assets items remain merely book
entries. Chief of these is £118,269 to the
credit of property, including the geological
observations by F. G. Clapp. Brokerage is
in at £5618. Shareholdings in Gisborne Oil
Pty., another non-producer, are set out at
£56,463. Stores and tools are valued at
£23.463. and the drilling done £20.136;
while £12,409 is written as the value of
buildings, cars and camp equipment. De-
posits and accrued interest at £65.786 and
cash £2384 are tangible enough. The issue
of 154,750 new shares at par on October 30
gives the finances another needed lift, and
a reserve wad of 145,250 remains in the
locker for a further shot, if necessary. Oil
rights have been acquired in all directions,
including two more in Taranaki, one in West-
land and an extensive area on the east coast
of the North Island.
* * * *
Rain still hampers the New Guinea Oil
Co., Vailala River, and the time to com-
mence drilling is not yet. Concurrently with
the annual meeting last week, manager Moore
announced by radio that 40 tons of plant
had been delivered on the bore site at Hohoro.
As this is less than two miles from the coast,
the co. is in a handy position for dealing with
a flow, if it ever gets one. Accounts are to
March 31, and much cash must have been
dribbled out since then. Of the 150,000
20s. shares, but 50.000 have been subscribed,
and the last 11,222 have had only ss. called
up. At the balancing date the co. had £7627
in deposits and cash; there was £1677 of
unpaid calls, and £8416 was uncalled on the
11,222 shares. The only ray of hope the
directors let in on shareholders is that they
“hope to be able to announce at an early
date when drilling may be commenced.” It
isn't much of a gleam after 18 months.
Austral Malay is floating its latest area,
Pnchong, about 11 miles from Kuala Lumpur
(F.M.S.). An area of 900 acres has 277
acres proved dredgable to a depth of 59
feet, the content being 26,300.000 yards of
84oz. stuff. A bucket dredge of 200.000 yards
monthly capacity is spoken of, giving the
area 11 years’ life. Reports by F. V.
Stanley, M. F. G. Burrows and D. Brig-
stocke agree on the main details, and set
out an annual profit of £47,000 with tin at
£225. Of the share capital of £250,000.
£lOO.OOO will be held in reserve, and, after
42,000 shares paid to 20s. have been
abstracted for the benefit of the parent con-
cern, 108,000 will be offered to existing
holders of Austral Malays, one for two. The
parent will also take £28,000 in cash. The
consulting engineers mention £75,000 as
the figure at which the productive stage
should be reached.

“W. J. Digger”: Many a Digger cursed
the fond parents who handed his descriptive
letters to a greedy press, for the journals
generally came to hand sooner or later,
and the effusion would be read out, to the
accompaniment of derisive laughter, by the
funny man of the platoon. Judson’s trans-
port was torpedoed, but owing largely to
excellent discipline no lives were lost, and
most of the men professed to regard the
whole thing as a rather humorous incident.
Judson wrote a vivid description of the
occurrence which somehow eluded the censor,
and his mother handed his letter to the local
newspaper, which printed it with cross head-
ings. “Boats were lowered quickly, but
without confusion,” ran the screed, “and
while I waited patiently for my turn to
scramble down the swaying rope ladder, I
meditatively picked my teeth.” The caption
was “Private Judson Picks Teeth in Face
of Death,” and though the writer proved
himself a good soldier and rose rapidly in
rank, and though men saluted him and well
deserved honors came his way, he remained
Toothpick Judson to the end of the chapter.

day as having its centre somewhere near
New Guinea may easily have reduced the
population of one or more of the innumer-
able islands to the north of us. I was
looking at one of the most fearsome vol-
cano-scapes in the world not long ago—
Gunung Batur, in Bali, Dutch East Indies.
The ten-mile fan of lava, so the Dutch resi-
dent told me, had done its work in 1917, the
loss of life running into thousands, yet I
don’t remember any notice of it in Aus-
tralian papers at the time. Certainly there
was an earthquake on in .Europe, in 1917
which might have smothered its vibrations;
but last year there wasn't even a Federal ]
election, yet a village of 900 people was i
tossed into a Javanese river, and the hotel (
in which I had stayed a month before was j
totally destroyed, without earning a men- 1
tion. Life is cheap up there and often an ]
embarrassment to its owners, and a cata-
clysm that would get big headlines if it
happened in a white country is regarded by
the local Government with feelings almost
amounting to relief.
“Retired Volt”: Interesting experiments
were recently made in U.S.A. to test the
powers of the sub-conscious mind. Radio
operators went to bed with ’phones strapped
to their heads, and next morning were able
to write down with fair accuracy long code
messages that had been transmitted to them
while they slept. This is the first time a
test has been applied to sleeping subjects,
but most telegraphists can tell of similar-
phenomena provided by the waking indivi-
dual. I know a Morse sound-reader who
ambles along comfortably two or three
ten-letter words behind in artificial code,
and another who can break off in the
reception of a press wire about French
Cabinet changes to conduct an argument on
the late elections, catching up the arrears of
40 or 50 words without having to stop his
enemy at the other end. I myself, at 4 a.m.
(the telegraphist’s zero hour), have
“gummed,” counted and docketed correctly
high-speed traffic while fast asleep.

“Nakhoda”: The smugglers of opium into
Australia don’t lack ingenuity. On one boat
it was the custom of the Chinese “boys” to
take ashore at their last port the pot plants
that decorated the dining-tables of the first
saloon, returning later with fresh vegetables
for the home voyage. Investigation at last
disclosed that an occasional pot was stuffed
with opium. Another daring device adopted
at a northern port was for a prominent resi-
dent to take aboard a freshly-cooked duck
under a dish-cover for an officer who doted
on duck. A laughing challenge to the Cus-
toms sleuth to lift the cover on the smug-
gler’s return was smilingly declined. And
there was the gang that floated a mining co.
(this was in the Philippines) for the sole
purpose of importing expensive machinery
stuffed with opium ; the lady with the sick
husband who must carry his own mattress
with him; and the third officer who remained
always a third officer because the third
always looked after the mails-r-he used to
forget the last bog, and had to race after
the mail-officer with it in a cab, and never
caught him. For every bit of strategy that
is detected a new one is devised.

“Chancery Lane” : The doubtful honor of
being the oldest respondent in an Australian
divorce suit mast
belong to Otto
Stranz, who at the
reputed age of 94
was divorced by
his 66-year-old wife
in Melbourne in
1917 because he
had committed a
bigamous marriage
with her 47 years
before. The prin-
cipal witness for
the petitioner was
an old lady of 84
who remembered
the first marriage
of Stranz, and pro-
duced a 60-year-old
card inviting her
to the christening
of his second child.
The evidence
showed that short-
ly after her mar-
riage in IS7O Mrs.
Stranz was in-
formed of her hus-
band's first mar-
riage, which took
place in Germany
and taxed him with
it, whereupon he
impolitely told her
to “go to th e
Devil," and cleared
out; and she never
saw him again. She
did not trouble
about the matter
until 1917, , when
the question of her nationality was raised.
The Court promptly released her.
“.T. Hop": Justice was not delayed in a
case before the presiding stipe in the Sydney
Central Police Court a few days ago. A
lady arrived early one morning by an over-
seas passenger boat. After breakfast she
went ashore to buy a railway ticket to Mel-
bourne,- leaving a valise on her bunk. At
J 1 a.m. she returned, and, seeking her valise,
found no trace of it. No one aboard could
give her any information. She ratlg up the
police, and got in touch with them. Before
the lady sat down to lunch she was called
on to identify her property. It had been found
in the possession of a thief well known to
the police. He was charged forthwith,
brought before the Court that afternoon, and,
with a long list of convictions against him,
was sent to Long Bay for 12 months. An
THE SINS OF THE MOTHERS.
“What trill your father say when he hears what a naughty lie
you have just told?”
“The same old thing, I expect — ‘lsn't she the image of her mother?’ ”
order was made to hand over the valise to
the owner, and she departed for Melbourne
that evening on the ticket she had taken in
the morning. Don’t talk of the law’s delays
after that!
“Solomon Merri”: The yarn about the
Germans boiling down their dead was first
circulated early in 1918, and received some
support from the credulous when the “Death
Chamber” at Bullecourt in the Ilindenburg
Line was discovered in October. An armor-
piercing shell hit an underground room below
the St. Quentin Canal tunnel and strewed
bits of the German occupants around the
walls. About 15 dead were found in the
hole ; one man, minus limbs, was squatting in
a copper of water surrounded by fat. Evi-
dently the place had been used by Fritz
as a kitchen and butcher’s shop—all the
usual tools of trade were found therein, in-
cluding a meatchopper. All the war-
correspondents at hand visited the place, to-
gether with about 281 generals, and while
we were there an m.o. took a sample of the
fat for analysis. “All damn nonsense,” said
Smithy of our batt. “That ain’t no boilin’-
down works. That fat is just plain beef
drippin’—l tasted it meself !”
“Dalpa”: “Did you hoar that Mabel has
at last succumbed to the slimming craze?”
remarked Miss Fashionplate. “Good
gracious, how sad!” returned the unsophis-
ticated one. “When people who are as fond
of food as Mabel start to starve one might
expect them to get ill, but not to die. When
was she buried?”
* * * *
“Snuills”: The nastiest advertisement
that the city has recently had was tendered
by a man who blew into Melbourne Hospital
“Cas” room with half an ear hanging off
and a general appearance of having been
trodden upon by an angry elephant. _ “I come
to Melbourne very often,” he said, after
mentioning how lie got his injuries, “and
every time I seem to get choked and
throttled.” lie had Collected his latest in-
juries, however, at a house in Carlton, where
sundry evil-disposed persons who included
biting among their accomplishments had
fallen upon him—he didn’t even know the
address of the place—and people who go a-
wandering into strange house's are likely to
meet rough adventures in any city. There
is a different sort of danger in Melbourne
to which witness is borne, by a man now
lying in hospital recovering from some bone-
breakages. This is his seventh trip to the
city, and on six of them he has finished up
by getting hurt in a motor-accident. On
the only trip that didn’t bring him that sort
of mishap he got married.
“Alwyn” : The cable about the alleged ex-
pedition to hunt for buried treasure on the
Cocos Islands recalls that as late as 1909 an
old sailor, armed with a thumb-marked chart,
used to wander around Perth endeavoring to
enlist capital for a. similar proposition. He
carried documents to show that in 1629 a
heavily-laden Dutch treasure frigate, the
B. tavia, ran ashore
on the Westralian
coast, near Roe-
buck Bay. A num-
ber of the crew
got ashore, and
after salvaging the
cargo the captain
went off in a small
boat to get assist-
ance. In li i s
absence part of the
c r c- w mutinied,
wiping another
part out. The cap-
tain retur n e d,
wiped out the muti-
neers and recov-
ered some of the
chests of gold and
silver. Many un-
successful attempts
have been made to
get the balance.
There are places
nearer home that
might repay the
attention of trea-
sure-hunters. The
proceeds of the
great Bank of Aus-
tralia robbery at
Sydney in 1828
were never recov-
ered. The plunder
consisted of £750
in British silver,
2030 Spanish dol-
lars, 2000 sov-
ereigns and £14,500
in banknotes; it
was thought at the
time that the. haul
was cached in some
remote spot on the
Nor t li Shore.
When the late
11. E. Rater,
M.L.C., was re-
lieved of several thousands! of exchange
notes by bushrangers Lowry and, Foley,
not far from Hartley (N.S.W.), the
former surrendered his share of the loot; hut
Lowry, who had hidden his somewhere in the
bush near Mudgee, was shot dead, and the
secret of the hiding-place perished with him.
“Capa”: The razor-bladed coat seized by
Sydney police (B. 29/10/’25) was not, as
“Anaf” supposed, a Southern European atro-
city ; the idea originated, according to the
Paris police, in the gory mind of one Pierre
Bonnot, apache and motor-bandit. Bonnot
had a canvas suit covered with razor-blades
from ankles to shoulders. This cheerful soul
was a real quatre-pique (four-ace) apache
with his clan sign—four aces and “Mort
mix' vaclies”—tattooed on his hide. He met a
violent end in company with one Gamier,
at Melvin, where the police had to invoke
the aid of artillery to dislodge the pair
from a garage in which they had sheltered.
Both were advanced socialists and left, in
true French style, long written “dying
speeches” full of Marxian phrases. A few
of the type may find their way to Australia,
because the French C.I.D. winks at the de-
parture of wanted crooks if it is sure
the journey is to a far country. To the
initiated it is quite easy to pick an apache
by clan-signs, which are indelible in the
case of the dyed-in-the-wool Belleville tribe.

THE HEAT-WAVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sudden and fierce summer has on us sprung,
And once again through windows opened wide
The hotness of his burning breath is flung
Into the cooler shadows where we hide.
Vanished are coats and manly throats are bared;
Whilst women bloom in garments gauzy thin.
More from our backs we’d shuffle if we dared
One touch of summer makes the whole world skin.
Ai 7 e seek for coolness where the languid seas
Lisp on the shores that shimmer in the heat,
Garbed lightly in the surfer’s “neck-to-knees”
Or what the regulations reckon meet.
But summer’s kisses set their viking seal
On back and shoulders, neck and arm and chin,
And maid and man slip on this bitter peel—
One touch of summer makes the -whole world skin.

“Click, clitter-clatter, clank-ker-rupp!”

It tells me neighbor Thomson’s up
And mowing at his lawn.
The shoots which hopeful grasses spread
May not a day survive;
With thoughts of mowing in his head,
He races home at five.
Yes; Thomson is that kind of man
Whose life, kept closely clipped,
And shaped and cut and smoothed to plan,
Of every weed is stripped.
No lapse the years o’er him that pass,
Have known, no casual sin—
Nor has he need of long-grown grass
To hide stray bottles in.
His lawn—and all his lawn conveys—
Shame in my heart should set,
I know, for his are ordered days,
His life well governed; yet
Profoundest pity stirs my breast
When, telling Thomson’s up,
The sound of mowing breaks my rest—

TO-DAY we are reaping yesterday’s harvest, and in turn preparing for to-morrow.
In 1847 the late Mr. J. Gramp foresaw the possibilities of the Australian wine-growing industry; to-day
enjoying the perfect results of his pioneering efforts—Gramp’s Orlando Wines.
By drinking these Australian wines we are building the nation to the achievement of its destiny.

Sydney crossing. The other fellow’s number-
plate and rear light fell to the roadway with
an unmusical tinkle, and my front mud-
guards crumpled. The inevitable crowd
gathered. From his post at the crossing
came the traffic cop, and, after the manner
of his kind, began taking notes. After the
usual conflicting stories had been taken down
and I was climbing back into my car, I
heard a plaintive voice saying, “Yes, con :

“G. Emcey”: The Townsville (Q.) police
showed some strategic qualities when the
Somerset and Paparoa —two oversea boats
whose seamen were striking—were tied up
at the wharf. An
attempt to get the
Somerset away had
been frustrated by
the strikers, who
secured the lines
of both steamers
to the hooks with
half-inch rope lash-
ings. Pickets were
then appointed in
relays to guard the
boats. After a
few u neve ntf u 1
days the water-
front was startled
one afternoon by
the arrival of sev-
eral carloads of
police, who headed
for the Somerset.
Word was quickly
spread that an-
other attempt was
to be made to get
the steamer away.
Crowds gathered,
inclu d i n g tin 1
pickets, and the
Paparoa was left
without even an
onlooker. Mean-
while a few plain-
clothes constables
unobtrusively de-
tached themselves
from the scene of
activity. Nothing
happened on the
Somerset, and the
crowd was begin-
ning to think that
it was merely a
d e m o n s t ration,
when the Paparoa
was noticed clear-
ing the wharf. With a whoop the spec-
tators rushed that way, arriving just in
time to see the plain-clothes men who had
cut the boat’s lines get on their bicycles
and ride off.
“Ooppertop” : lieturning on the Euripides
in September, ’l9, one of our army officers
lost 30 Australian pound-
notes two days before reach-
ing Durban. A Digger
found the lost bundle, and
the usual notice, “A reward
will be paid, etc. Apply the
Adjutant,” caused him to
hand over the notes to the
Adjutant, who turned them
over to the rightful owner.
Next morning another notice
appeared over the original
one. It was a sheet of card-
board with a hole in the
centre large enough to allow
of a two-shilling piece being
suspended by a piece of
string. It bore the follow-
ing inscription : “It pays to
be honest! This is the re-
ward I received for handing
back 30 quid which I found.
As I am dead-broke a two-
shilling piece with a hole in
it won’t make me a plutocrat.”

“Lang Syne” : The Victorian Old Pioneers’
Association recently held a commemoration
service in St. James’ old Cathedral, West
Melbourne. The time-blackened edifice was
an appropriate gathering-place for the grey-
lieads. It is knit into the early history of
the Anglican Church in Victoria as no other
building can be. The new cathedral is, of
course, an incomparably worthier home, but
it has not yet acquired the atmosphere of
sentiment that drapes the walls of St.
James’s like the tattered flags of some ancient
English church. One recalls old Bishop
Perry, and, just as instantaneously, the
quaint figure and still quainter character of
Dean Macartney. The dean was the son
of a member of the last Irish Parliament- ■
bribed out of existence. It was somewhere
about his sixteenth birthday when a fishing
smack crossed the Channel and brought news
of the victory at Waterloo. The aggres-
sive type of Irishman, he was yqt so
tender of heart that he would part with his
shirt even to an opponent who lacked one.
There was no saint of old, not even Columba
nor Chad, who suffered more privation and
rough usage in missionary travel than did
Hussey Burgh Macartney. One Sunday
morning he arrived on his old nag at a
little school, kept by a widow and her two
daughters. He was drenched. There was
no change of men’s clothing in that little
habitation, but the widow had a fine, warm
red-flannel petticoat, so without more ado she
brought it to the dripping man, and, divest-
ing himself of his sodden pants, he gathered
in its dry, warm amplitude, then drew his
surplice from the saddle-bag, and so arrayed
—a cross between an acolyte and a priest—

women assembled. On the 95th anniversary
of his birthday he preached in St. James’s,
where for many years he had been incumbent.

“Percy Pinktapo” : A man in a hurry to
get to gaol turned up in a Melbourne court
the other day. Several times during the
proceedings he had
shown restlessness,
and once or twice
lie asked anxiously
w h e n his case
would be dealt
with; but it was
after he had been
committed for trial
at the fag-end of
the day’s proceed-
ings that his pent-
up aggravation
found expression in
a complaint that
he had been kept
so long fooling
about that the pri-
son ’bus would
have gone without
him, and he would
be obliged to stay
at the watch-house
for the night. The
Bench expressed it-
self surprised at
his hurry. “I’ve
missed me dinner!”
he explained ex-
plosively ; and the
suggestion of a
policeman that
some bread would
be supplied to him
at the watch-house
merely served to
add to his bitter-
ness at the loss of the baked meats of Pent-
ridge.

“Oxmead”: The most conscientious man
of science I ever knew was analyst to the
Kalgoorlie (W.A.) municipality a trifle
under 20 years ago. His name had a Teu-
tonic ring, and his methods were Teutonic
in their thoroughness. A consignment of
condensed-milk had been seized, on suspicion
of being unfit for human consumption—con-
densed-milk often deteriorated rapidly in the
goldfields summer, but it didn’t always be-
come as unwholesome as it looked —and was
sent to the municipal analyst for a ruling.
The expert subjected the stuff to various
chemical tests, which failed to satisfy him
that it was absolutely unfit for human con-
sumption, although it was obviously on the
damaged side. Finally, in his noble zeal
to solve the problem that was baffling him.
he dissolved a generous ration of it in a cup
of tea, swallowed the mixture, and sat back
to await events. He didn’t have to wait
long, and his harrowing story of the effect
of the milk on his own system, as told a week
later to a P.M., resulted in a stiff fine for
the merchant who bad tried to put this par-
ticular consignment on the market. But the
man who had martyred himself received no
reward Beyond the consciousness of having
done his job.
* * * *
“Lao-dah” : The bailiffs called on a Stock-
ton (N.S.W.) storekeeper the other day and
told him they were going to take possession
of his furniture and camp in his shop until
the goods were sold. Being a re-
specter of landlords who owed no man
anything, the startled citizen asked the
reason why, and was informed that
the lessee of the property he rented
owed money to the estate of which it formed
a part, and that the invasion was supported
by a law dating back to 1600. A hasty call
on a solicitor confirmed the bailiffs’ inter-
pretation. The fantastic happening is an-
other illustration of the law’s asininity and
the mouldy nature of much of its pack.
A law of Charles 11. still provides that “any
drover, horse courser, waggoner, butcher,
higgler or any of their servants travelling or
coming into an inn or lodging upon the
Lord’s Day is liable to a penalty.” A higgler
in Carolus Seeundus’s day was one who
hawked goods for sale and was “tedious and
nice in bargaining”; hence a commercial
traveller.

“Verri”: Children, as Barrie remarks, ac-
cept all things unquestioningly, and “will
meet their ‘dead’ father in the wood, have
a game with him, and forget to mention it
until a fortnight later.” This casualness
nearly cost a youthful Australian his life
the other day. When the mother called the
two children into lunch only the girl
arrived. “Where’s Jimmy?” she was asked.
“In the creek.” was the reply. “What part
of the creek?” gasped the startled 1 mother.
“At the bottom,” said little sister serenely.
It was nearly the end of Jimmy, but an
hour’s hard work brought him round.

“Kadi”: In “the East” are many Solo-
mons. One is a Judge of the Bengal High
Court, who lately solved a problem of owner-
ship. Two Hindu ladies came before his
Honor, each protesting herself to be the
owner of a certain cow, most sacred of ani-
mals. It is no light honor to possess a eow,
so to it the parties went with all the legal
weapons of assault they could purchase.
Witness after witness was called, and the

BERTHA : “ Let’s hope it has, my dear, and that he'll turn up
some day!"
case was prolonged till the Judge, weary and
ostensibly apprehensive of the financial ruin
of the ladies, called a halt. This cow, de-
spite its sacred origin, had gone astray and
wandered many miles from its home, which-
ever of the two owned it. Why not put the
onus of proof - on the cow? So his Honor
directed her to be taken up the mountains
to a gorge about equally distant from the
house of each claimant. Out of this gorge
led a roadway which gave access to each of
the residences. The cow, once lodged in the
gorge and left to her own sweet will, would
surely stroll along the roadway and drop
in at the home of the devout lady to whom
she belonged. And so it came about, and
’s Honor made an order accordingly, with
costs.

“The Ohinemuri electorate voted to go wet again,
after being dry for 17 years. The restoration was
carried by 48 votes above the three-fifths majority
required. This is the first district in Maoriland
to restore licenses after going dry.”
Dry—thirsty, too, as fury—-
It stayed, Ohinemuri;
Put in the peg de jure
And barred the c-up that cheers;
Let none his substance fritter
In bars that gleam and glitter- •

O bitter-beerless years!
It exorcised the dragon
That lurks in pot and flagon;
Upon the water-waggon
The district rode serene;
Nor rum there was, nor rummers,
Nor revellers nor hummers,
Nor jamborees—for summers
And winters seventeen.
The Trade (cap. T) was routed,
No pumps their hop-juice spouted,
No Toby Tosspots shouted,
Nor any glasses clinkt.
Old topers, parched and grizzled,
Sans tiddleys froze or frizzled;
Potential barmaids mizzled
And Bungs became extinct.
No sinners shot or shickered
At nightfall brawled and bickered,
Or into ehokee flickered
Escorted by the watch;
No boozers fines were handed
By beaks, or reprimanded;
Black was brown brandy branded
And scotched the snake of Score h.
Years seven and ten they brooked not
Nosepaint, and elbow crooked not;
On ruby wine they looked not
In resolution firm.
And now the bit they’ve jolted
From out their mouths and bolted,
Reneged, rebelled, revolted —
Turned as the trodden worm !
O leaden years and aching!
That “parch” will take some slaking
That’s been so long a-making,
A man may safely bet.
I wish —I wish like fury—
I only owned a brew’ry
In old Ohinemuri
That’s veered from dry to wet.

The death of ex-Speaker Charley Mc-
Donald on the eve of the general election is
not the first to rob Labor of a seat under
similar circumstances. The late Senator
Gregor McGregor (S.A.) died between nomi-
nation and election-day in August, 1914, and
Labor supporters were thus compelled to
vote for one candidate whose policy they
considered inimical to the best interests of
Australia, or make their votes informal. In
McDonald’s case the electors of Kennedy
(Q.) did not even have that privilege. The
other candidate gets the seat, though he
might not have had Buckley’s chance at a
poll.
J. 11. Maiden, the veteran ex-director of
Sydney Botanic Gardens and a botanist of
world-wide fame, continued right up to the
end, which came the other day at 66, to fight
the good fight for Australia’s disappearing
flora. One of his last actions was to write
a letter to the dailies warning citizens
against the growth of Bolshevik weeds and
grasses that threaten the native bush all
around Sydney. Recently newspaper read-
ers were enchanted at the spectacle of a
champion of the waratah as Australia’s
national flower entering the lists against
Maiden, who advocated the wattle. The
waratah knight was in deadly earnest; but
Maiden was gifted with a quiet sense of
humor, and even when his opponent re-
corded how he had stirred meetings in other
States to hiss the hated yellow bloom,
Maiden’s broad wink at the public never
slackened. His great work on the eucalypt
in over 64 volumes is his monument.
Dr. L. W. Nott, who fought Theodore for
Herbert (Q.), has had a crowded youth. Born
in Bundaberg, where liis father was one of
the first sugar-growers, he was educated at
Maryborough Grammar School. Leaving
there he turned to mining engineering and
metallurgical chemistry, completing the
diploma course at Ballarat School of Mines
and securing a first-class honors pass. He
matriculated at Sydney, and entered the
Medical School in 1909. Subsequently he
went to Edinburgh, and graduated from
there with honors. He saw two years of the
war with a Scottish regiment, then, return-
ing to Australia, worked on the hookworm
survey, and after starting in private prac-
tice in Mackay (N.Q.) interested himself in
municipal politics, and at the last elections
became chief bumble of his town.
By the death of E. C. Warde, of Flem-
ington, the Vic. Parliament has lost its
fattest member. Warde, who was 63, had
been a politician for 25 years, and once had
a reputation for oratory and frequent inter-
jections. His father, Clarence Coughlan
Warde, was an old-time actor, and from him
lie secured a training in rhetorical delivery,
as William Holman, in N.S.W., did from
his actor dad. There was another point of
resemblance: they both did their first work
in the furniture trade.
It. looks as if Lieut.-Gov. Irvine will have
another longish innings as Victoria’s rubber-
stamp, from February onward. After Lord
Stanley doffed the cocked-liat in 1919 the
C.J. was in command for 19 "months, and
received Edward P. when he was on tour
in ’2O. Vic. refused to join with the other
five (Labor-ruled) States in memorialising
the Dominions office in London to appoint
Australians as Governors; but it is quite
well known that opinion is almost equally
divided in even the Vic. Leg. Assembly on
the question.
One of Maoriland’s few native-born
baronets. Sir Andrew Fleming Hudleston le
Fleming, passed out recently at Dunedin.
Born in Christchurch 69 years ago, lie was
the eighth holder of the title. His wife was
a Miss Frazer, also a Maorilander; as
there are no children, the baronetcy goes to
a cousin at Otakeho, Taranaki. Rydal Hall,
in Westmoreland, was originally the family
seat, and famous Carnarvon Castle once
belonged to the le Flemings.
On Wednesday John Allan completed a
year as Premier of Victoria. No head of
that State ever worried less. He does what
he reckons a fair thing, and after that he
doesn’t seem to care what happens.
One of the four officers who took the last
dive with submarine Ml off Devon (Eng.)
last week was Lieut. Robert Cameron Casey,
of Tasmania. He was 25, and graduated
from Jervis Bay (N.S.W.). He went to
England for experience of underwater fight-
ing, and was to have returned in one of
the two new submarine-cruisers being con-
structed for the R.A.N.
Henry Reynolds, who died recently in
London, was a pioneer of Maoriland’s dairy-
ing industry. In 1880 he started a butter-
factory which was run at a loss. As a for-
lorn hope, he took some of his commodity,
frozen, to the Cold Country. It was as good
on arrival as when he left M.L. and sold
well. The veteran saw the export trade
(butter and cheese) grow to nearly
£20,000,000 p.a.
Since the M.L. Govei-nment refused to
help Captain Kingsford Smith, the Austra-
lian aviator, to hop across the Tasman, two
young Maorilanders, Flight-Lieutenant J. B.
Moncrieff and Victor Carmine, have taken
up the challenge of the 1200-mile strait.
They propose to do it in an Inverness
equipped with two Napier 450-h.p. engines.
The ’bus has a telescopic mast and sails,
which the adventurers hope will bring them
safely in if they have to descend. The dis-
tance is not great, but the Pacific is at its
wildest in the Tasman, and the volcanic
backbone of the Windy Islands offers poor
landings. For those reasons aviation hasn’t
prospered in M.L., and a cautious Govern-
ment has shown more interest in cold stor-
age for its eggs and butter.
A member of the N.S.W. Historical
Society, R. M. O’Connell, perches in the
same family tree as the celebrated Daniel.
He is a grandson of Sir Maurice O’Connell,
a bygone N.S.W.
Lieutenant - Gov-
ernor, whose re-
mains are in the
old Camperdown
(Sydney) Ceme-
tery. Maurice was
a nephew of the
great Irish patriot,
the present - day
member of th e
family has in his
possession the
breastplate en-
graved with the
word “Waterloo,”
which Sir Maurice,
then Captain
O’Connell. wore
wh e n he went
with the 73rd Regi-
ment into that
historic scrap.
Governor-General
STONEHAVEN.
Passed out in Brisbane, at 58, ,T. T. Joyce,
fine sport and good fellow. Born in New-
port, Ireland, he came to Australia in 1883,
beginning work for the Helidon Spa Co. as
a message boy. At his death he was manag-
ing director. Joyce held the amateur boxing
championship of Queensland, was a well-
known athlete, and his horses have done
well in Queensland and N. S. Wales.
One of the most interesting of the short
stories that have been awarded a place in the
Christmas Bulletin (Dec. 12) is by Gordon
Trollope-—interesting both because of the
story itself and because it is written by a
grandson of Anthony Trollope, who helped
Dickens and Thackeray to form the famous
trinity of mid-Victorian novelists. It is an
extraordinary family: literature runs in its
blood generation after generation. First
there was Frances Milton Trollope, who
wrote 115 volumes : among them was “Domes-
tic Manners of the Americans,” written just
on a hundred years ago, which caused a sen-
sation in its time. Her eldest son wrote
many historical novels. Anthony was the
third son. His son, H.M., likewise a novel-
ist, wrote also a life of his father. Another
member of the family settled in western N.
8. Wales as a young man, and was for many
years afterwards a chairman of Land Boards ;
and it was out in the mulga country his son
Gordon got the color for the story which the
Christmas Bulletin will include.
Obit, Edward Hawson, Small Sister’s most
persistent and best-beloved Methodist Sun-
day-school “head.” Mr. Hawson managed
Hobart’s chief trustee co., the Perpetual,
some 40 years for his daily bread, and for
a longer period superintended Davey-street
Metliody school for Sunday recreation. In
addition he was treasurer of the local Royal
Pastoral and Agricultural Society for nearly
half a century and president thereof during
his later years. He was just on 80.
Although Australia has proved experts
such as Basedow, M.A.. M.D., Ph.D., F.G.S.,
etc., of large enough frame to fill its new
chair of Anthropology at Sydney University,
Radcliffe Brown, M.A., is to come from
Capetown to do it. True, the importation
also has a world reputation. Tie is an
English graduate who studied the Binghis of
India and the local abo. of the Andamans,
which is India's Pinchgut, and wrote valu-
able screeds about them.
Archbishop Cerretti, who was Australia’s
first Apostolic Delegate, has finished liis work
as Papal Nuncio in Paris. He made good
with Premier Briand, and as a reward is
about to be added to the College of Cardinals.
The breezy cleric, who is only 53 and
modern in liis methods, should liven up that
ecclesiastical Upper House.
A progressive Australian is Gordon Brown.
Twenty-four years ago he was a bank clerk
at £BO p.a. Neither the job nor the pay
suiting him, he struck out for S’Africa.
After a few ups and downs he trekked north
to the coffee plantations, where he soon
made good. His next venture was in oil,
in which he acquired big holdings. When the
oil interests were merged in the Mozambique
Corporation, controlling a capital of
£7,000,000, he became its managing director.
Now the homeland has called, and Brown,
having resigned and sold out his interests,
is back in Victoria, where he intends to
settle.
Archdeacon Richard Thomas, of Herberton
(N.Q.), will step into the gentle Gilbert
White’s gaiters and bisli the vast diocese
of Willochra, comprising a huge area of
Australia’s empty North. The Archdeacon
learnt about Jonah and the whale at the
House of the Sacred Mission at Ketham,
England, and left a smooth curacy in
Coventry to get at grips with life as a Bush
Brother in Bananaland’s tropics 14 years
ago. In 1922 he was appointed archdeacon
of North Queensland.
It fell to Alec Peacock, Vic. Treasurer,
last week to be pall-bearer at a funeral and
giver-away of the bride at a wedding on the
same day. As “Father” of the Leg. Assem-
bly he attended the burial of Ted Warde,
M.L.A., and played the role of heavy uncle
at the marriage of his niece, Nurse Enid
Fyson—her dad is dead —to Dr. Arthur
Uglow, of Rutherglen.
E. H. Bakewell, who has been president
of the Employers’ Federation in S.A. for
the past ten years and has just been re-
appointed, is to have his name commemo-
rated by the Tramways Trust in Adelaide.
Bakewell Bridge is the name given to the
new causeway across the west parklands
which will run the traffic from Henley and
intermediate suburbs up Currie-street and
lessen the congestion in King William-street.
In the City Council Bert Edwards queried
the complimentary name, and, being assured
by Lewis Cohen that it was in recognition
of long service rendered by Bakewell to the
trust, replied tersely: “The lot of you ought
to be shot.” The same day, another mem
ber of the M.T.T., Robert Duncan, was
elected president of S.A. Chamber of Manu-
factures in succession to Perry. In accept-
ing it he gave reminiscences of his IS
predecessors in the chair, from Samuel
Davenport onwards. He is a director of Dun-
can and Fraser, a carriage-building firm of
the old days, now bustling motor-car builders.
When Alex. Peacock, Vic. Treasurer, went
up to Clunes last week to meet former resi-
dents who had come back for a week, one
old supporter asked him if he still regarded
Guy Fawkes Day as a great anniversary.
Smiling loudly Alec admitted that he did,
and then lie explained to the others not in
the know that he was given office for the
first time by Munro on Nov. 5, 1890. Since
then he has been in 13 Governments.
That remarkable octogenarian, Captain
J. H. Watson, past-president of the N.S.W.
Royal Historical Society, has been eye-
witness of some interesting events. Born at
Plymouth in 1841, he saw the first railway
built to that port. In 1851 he witnessed
the launching of the first battleship. He
saw the troops go out to the Kaffir War, and
his school got a holiday when the Duke of
Wellington had a funeral. He satv troops
off to the Crimea in 1854, and watched the
late King Edward, then 12 years old, have
a scrap on the royal yacht with his brother
Alfred (Duke of Edinburgh), and Queen
Victoria beat them both with a green parasol.
JACK SAFE, of the historic “Young and
Jackson’s,” the new president of Vic.
Incensed Victuallers’ Association.
Four of the Australian Premiers —Lang
(Ma State), Allan (Vic.), Lyons (Speck)
and McCormack (Q.) rule their native
States. The two others—Collier (W.A.)
and Gunn (S. Aus.) —were born in Victoria.
DRIFTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’re settled down and drifting,
We’ve ceased to look ahead;
And we can rest contented,
Now our ambition’s dead.
No chasing after fortune,
No hankering for fame;
Let youth have its wild scramble
And we will watch the game!
Calm are the days of drifting;
Smooth running is the tide.
A book is. at our elbow,
Our pipe. lies close beside;
And where we drowse at noonday
Full-fruited spreads a vine.
We’ve bottles in the cooler
Of Riverina wine.
AVe claim .we are no gluttons
And simple is our board.
A roasted leg or shoulder
Is worth a miser’s hoard.
A bite with an old swagman,
Full-bearded and sedate,
Beside the Murrumbidgee—
I’d wish no finer mate.
We’re settled now and drifting
When silent waters creep
In reed-fringed channel prisons
Where whirlwinds used to sweep.
Keen youth may strive and struggle
For name and fame and gold;
But we will take it easy,
Now we are growing old.
In days we well remember,
When we were young and bold,
High peaks we scaled for pleasure
And deep we dug for gold.
We’ve rtramped from dawn to sunset;
We’ve ridden through the night,
The Southern Cross our compass,
The dawn our beacon light.
We’ve skirted flooded rivers
At breaking of a drought
With saddle-hack and pack-horse
To stations further out.
We’ve changed cur names in seasons
When rouseabouts have struck—
There might bo other reasons;
It may have been for luck 1
WALTER BENNETT, Nationalist member
for Maitland (N.S.W.), first elected 1898.
The groove we’re in is cosy,
Though it is strong and deep
And worn by daily habit
Of eat and drink and sleep.
We croak not of lost chances,
Or years we’ve, lived in vain;
If we could have them over
We’d live the! same again.
Where long-armed vines are twining
We potter with a hoe
And plant a bulb or seedling
Where we may watch it grow.
Long-haired, loose-robed and tranquil,
Too old to study thrift —
Oh, good years are the ’fifties
While we’re content to drift!
N.S.W.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Canar”: In some parts of North Aus-
tralia the problem of keeping animals from a favorite
waterhole has been solved by the natives in the
following manner. A complete skeleton of each
animal likely to visit the hole is placed where it
cannot fail to be seen, the idea being that every
living creature is scared by the skeleton of its own
kind, though it may not fear bones of any other
sort. A horse will pass unheedingly the skulls and
bones of dead cattle at the side of a road, but shy
violently' at the skeleton remains of one of its
own species. The adoption of this trick is said
to work perfectly, even to the extent that snakes will
avoid a waterhole where a reptilian skeleton dangles
from a couple of sticks.
“C.” : Will some Abo. please tell me wliat
is meant by the name “wild canary” or “bush
canary”? It seems to be one of those useless make-
shift names—like wild lilac or bush may—meaning
something different in every district. Is the bush
canary so called because of its color, or its song, or
both ? 1 have heard someone say, “Listen —a
canary!” The fine jigging tarantelle that followed
was the song of the little white-shafted fantail, the
flycatcher that builds a nest with a stem like a
wineglass. Then someone has said, “Look —a wild
canary !” and then it was either a yellow shrike-robin,
yellow-breasted and dark-green backed, or the bril-
liant golden-breasted whistler. Those people could
not all have been right. But what does a real
bird-lover mean when he mentions a bush canary in
cold print? He says its song beats that of the
caged canary, but that would be true in the case
of any of these birds. Isn’t it time the whole
matter of birds’ names in Australia was cleared up?
“Tamornie”: This is from the Montreal
Gazette, reporting a speech by a South Australian
legislator: “A new menace to the development of the
interior of Australia consists of herds of wild horses.
T ears ago many horses were taken to the Far North
for the purpose of breeding remounts, but the pro-
ject was abandoned, and since then breeding has
been uncontrolled, with the result that brambles
are over-running the country, consuming food and
water to the detriment and danger of valuable
stock.” No doubt about the brumby, which is
apparently what the Canadian means, being a curse,
and for the most part useless when caught and
broken-in, but some, notably those in the Elsie
Downs district of the N.T., are fine animals. Many
still show the Arab strain, introduced by Dr. Brown
when the first attempt was made to stock that coun-
try, an attempt subsequently abandoned on account
of the trouble given by the blacks. The Lenny
brumbies are well known on the Barkly Tableland
around Alexandria and Sudan stations. They came
from stock owned by an old Irishman named Patrick
Lenny, who would never sell a horse. Periodical
rounds-up of them have been made, and the animals
sold for what they would bring. On one occasion I
saw 75 head sold for £l7 10s. at the Rankine River
pound.
* * # *
“.Timsey”: Has any Abo. seen a wild
apple-tree struck by lightning ? When I was a
youngster a binghi stockman and I were caught in
a bad thunderstorm, and the former at once made
for the shelter of a big apple-tree. While there
he explained to me that the lightning would never
touch an apple-tree, and as long as we remained
near it we were safe. Since then I have been on
the lookout for an apple-tree that had been struck,
and am still looking.
“Tamornie” : I have smoked native-grown
tobacco in many places, and have found the best to
he that grown in the Malala district of ex-German
New Guinea. Its leaf when made into cigars is equal
to any purchased in the South. The method of pre-
paration is unorthodox. The leaves are stripped and
then wilted in the sun, and afterwards loosely packed
in bundles. These are wrapped in sheets of the
material which surrounds the flower spathe of the
cabbage-palm. The bundles are then hung inside
the hut roofs. At one stage the leaf is so moist
that juice is easily squeezed from a bundle. The
tobacco remains thus in its packages up to five
months, when it is considered cured. It was in this
district that, between 30 and 40 years ago, the
Neu Guinea Compagnie had tobacco plantations, under
Captain Miller, worked by Chinese. The natives
massacred nearly all of them and the project was
abandoned. I have also seen over a ton of tobacco
unloaded in one consignment from the mission steamer
at Alexishafen, being the result of a trip to Mariens-
berg on the Sepic River. This tobacco was too
strong for the average white palate, and the
traders who used it had first to dip the leaves in
hot water and dry them again. In the hills I have
seen natives take a green tobacco leaf and, drying it
over the fire, wrap it in a tree leaf and smoke it.
I tried it but once. The first inhalation was like a
blow from a hammer.
“Atherton” : North Queensland abo. tribes
have certain foods tabooed them during certain
periods of life. Thus before initiation into warrior-
hood the youngsters are allowed foods which are
strictly barred them during the following y r -ars.
In some tribes certain
foods are held sacred
to the grey heads.
Penalties for eating
tabooed foods are
based mainly on super-
natural fear. The
•wounds of any lad or
girl disobedient during
initiation ceremonies
will inflame and be-
come poisoned. Quite
possibly the spirits
will cause portion of
his or her body to drop
off. During pregnancy
both wife and husband
have certain foods
denied them. Indul-
gence in them means
possibly the death of
the woman and a weak-
ening of the man’s
spear-arm. Relatives
of the newly-dead are
denied certain foods
for three months. Fail-
ure to conform means
that the spirit of the
dead will haunt them.
A widow is placed
under a ban of silence
for, in some cases, 12
months. She sits in
camp with all her
clay, ashes and ochre
daubs of mourning upon
her. Only certain foods
may she collect her-
self, the other neces-
sary eatables being-
placed silently before
her. She is expected
to wound herself with
the sharp-pointed yam-
stick and the glowing
firestick. When her
ban of silence ends
there is a tribal ceremony at the gathering of the
grass-seed, and the woman once more takes hei
place as a normal female.

“The Elder Son” : Jimmy Joliffe, a Canow-
indra (N.S.W.) man, once shore four sheep in five,
minutes. Last shearing season (1924) Tom Aspith
shingled 34 in 30 minutes. The same expert un-
dressed 101 sheep in exactly 3hr., so the two-
minute standard is now out of date.
“Harvib”: Alf Bishop, shearing contractor, of
Walgett (N.S.W.), can shear a sheep in less than
two minutes. Furthermore, he will vouch the same
time for many shearers, and also for the record of one
man —S. Weber, of Rosehill—who took off a jumbuek's
jacket in one minute. At Goonoo Goonoo (N.S.W.)
31 shearers averaged 204 sheep in 7hr. 20min., or
6 in 13 minutes, and the team included learners,
one man’s tally being only 61.
* * *
“Slam” : I got my first glimpse of a camp
of the spectacled flying-fox lately on a mangrove
island in Moreton Bay (Q.). The musky whiff was
much stronger than it is in communities of collared
or dusky foxes found in the thick scrubs on the
mainland. The little beasts are quiet in camp, and
hang like great clustery of fruit, sometimes a string
of four or five clinging to each other. There were
a good many young suckling at the breast, hanging
to their mothers, head downwards. One specimen
measured 12in., and had the yellow rings (or spec-
tacles) well developed around the eyes. The Boards
give 3d. per fox, but it ought to be 10s. in view
of their ravages.
♦ * * *
“Fana”: An effective method of destroying
green timber is to bore a hole in the trunk of the
tree, two or three feet above the ground, and pour
in a few ounces of sulphuric-acid. A half-inch auger
is used, and the hole is made at an angle of about
45 degrees, the acid employed being the strong-
commercial variety. I’ve found the trees die quicker
than when they are ringbarked, and the work is
less laborious. Other substances besides sulphuric-
acid have been used, including cyanide; but the
latter is a dangerous poison to have lying around.
* * * *
“Wiremu” : About 60 years ago the village
elders at Waitara (M.L.) were perturbed by the
behavior of the village Don Juan, who, being also a
toa, well skilled in arms, had added murder to his
offences, splitting the heads of several of the pro-
testing husbands. The elders thereupon issued their
sentence that the man must be killed. No one cared
for the executioner’s job, but Te Rangi, a Ngatika-
ltungunu chief, on a visit, kindly offered to officiate,
and, seizing an opportune moment, blew the offend-
er’s head off. After the first breath of relief at
having found someone to do the unpleasant job, one
of the inamoratas of the deceased raised a question
of the right of a Ngatikahungunu to murder a
Waitara warrior, and the men of the tribe had to
agree that retribution must be obtained for the
act. Promptly Te Rangi fled, and, although pur-
sued for several days, eventually escaped. A langa
(curse) was laid upon him and his descendants for
ever; if they ever came to Waitara their lives
would b’e forfeit. Fifty-five years passed, and Te
Puia, a descendant of Te Rangi, married to a South
Island Maori husband, decided to accompany him
with a party t° a big hui that was being held at
Waitara. After her arrival she chanted her
HE WOULDN'T BE IN THE WAY.
HOUSEMAID: "Hold hat'd, sir, there is someone in there!"
DAD: “Thai’s all right! I only want to wash me ’ands.”
whakapapa (genealogy). An old crone who listened
said: “You who are descended from Te Rangi are
foolish to come here, for you will never leave Waitara
alive.” The story was told to the girl, and almost
immediately she became ill, and in a few days was
dead. The pakcha may ascribe the death to fright
or natural causes, but the Maori knows the potency
of makutu.

“Moo” : Paradise-bird hunting in the New
Guinea territory owned by Holland is not what it
used to be. A few years ago the plumes
of the red, brown and yellow birds could
be depended on to bring from £5 to
£lO apiece, while those of the blue bird, the rarest
and most beautiful, were sold for as much as £5O.
But of late, though the birds have been growing
scarcer and scarcer, the demand for the plumes in
Europe and America has steadily diminished, so the
number of hunters starting out from Merauke, the
headquarters of the industry, has got fewer and
fewer. Recently the Administration has been con-
sidering the advisability of prohibiting hunting alto-
gether for a period, in order to let the birds breed
up again to something like their former numbers.

“X.”: The aboriginal letter-stick is still
working in Northern Australia. The other day the
superintendent of a new mission station had occa-
sion to visit Thursday Island for a couple of weeks,
and there received a “letter” from one of his bush
boys, who wanted some things for his wife. Not
wishing to show his inability to read the stick, he
said to the messenger who brought it, “Oh, yes,
this one from Billy, eh? Good! I read him by-
and-bye when I not busy. You savee this one, too?”
“Oh, me know little bit that one. Billy he want
some piece tabacca and some hair-cement belong his
wife.” “Ah, yes, so he does; but which way he
write that ‘hair-cement’ ?” peering at the slashes
on the piece of wood. “Oh, she want that same kind
hair-cement he stop along bottle make him smell
good.” Billy duly got his hair-scent.
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: Something like a record
sparrows’ nest was lately brought to light by work-
men effecting repairs to an old lady’s house in Adel-
aide that had been occupied by her for 40 years.
Great numbers of birds must have been at work,
for the space between gabled roof and ceiling was
filled with a mass of the usual nest-building material.
A rough estimate made by the men who shifted the
stuff was that it would turn the scale at 10 tons —
four lorry-loads.

PROM THE FRINGE OF THE WHEAT BELT
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is not a fortune I bid for.
I was born with a hunger for land,
And when I came first in the ballot
1 felt that good luck was at hand.
I was always a toiler, a hireling,
Whose sweat was another man’s gain ;
I bow to none now but the Master
And pray for a downpour of rain.
Long months I have worked at the clearing ;
The land was a forest of scrub,
Of saplings that grew without number,
And trees whose roots I must grub.
I piled up and burnt the waste timber.
Each stick, till the place looked a plain ;
And ten bags to the acre is dying—
O Lord, send a downpour of rain!
We put the fence up in the moonlight—
The wife and the kids pulled the wire ;
I ploughed a wide strip right around it
To act as a break for a fire.
Then rain came and hope came and mounted
So high it was almost a pain ;
And now I am nearly despairing—
O God, send a downpour of rain!
The sky is as clear as a mirror,
While withering westerlies blow
And suck the earth dry like a vampire
From roots that are fainting below.
Wind greets the sun’s rise in the morning
And halts when the day’s on the wane—
O Lord, turn it north, south or eastward,
And send us a downpour of rain!
Gape-beaked are the birds seeking shelter, ; -
Wings sagging and drooping of tail
They perch on the kurrajong’s branches;
And short is the flight of the quail.
Pressed flat is the grass where the shade is,
With marks where the cattle have lain.
Impure is the water we’re drinking;
O Master, we’re asking for rain.
The store holds my notes till the harvest
For clothes and the food that we eat;
There’s the plough and the drill and the header,
For them all there’s a lien on the wheat.
In rags and barefoot are the children,
My wife’s breaking down with the strain;
At night when they’re sound in their slumber
I know that she’s praying for rain.
ALL IN THE GAME.
PRISONER ( acquitted, to Judge) : “Never maind, old sport —you might ’ave the laugh
on me next time!”
•And there is the bank with the moitgage.
I’d super, to buy, and the seed,
The wire for the fence and. the fodder —
I’d four or five horses to feed.
The hot sand and whirlwinds are sweeping
The dry grass and leaves from the plain,
Where clouds of red dust are now rising
For w'ant of a downfall of rain.
A year we’ve been waiting and watching;
The land was well fallowed and clear.
It’s only a month now till harvest
And the first of the summer is here !
Dark grey is the flag, and it’s drooping;
The hot winds are pinching the grain.
A week without rain and it’s ruined—
In Thy mercy, O Lord, send us rain!

Says It—Sales Prove It
Hudson and Essex are the largest
selling 6-cylinder cars in the world,
not merely because of their astonish-
ingly low prices, but because they
give chassis value and performance
that would be well regarded in the
highest-priced cars. No car within
hundreds of dollars of these prices
approach Hudson-Essex in smooth-
ness, reliability, easy riding and
brilliancy of performance.
The world’s largest volume of 6-
cylinder cars gives economy advan-
tages in purchase of materials, manu-
facture and distribution that no
other maker shares.
Hudson is called the “World’s Great-
est Buy,” not for to-day alone. That
is acknowledgment of ten years’
constant refinement of a great car
around the famous patented Super-
Six principle. Basic patents have
kept others from copying its motor.
The smoothness and long life it gives
are exclusive.
All now know that higher price can
buy no smoother performance than
Hudson’s. It cannot buy more bril-
liant results in pick-up, power or
speed. It cannot buy greater reli-
ability or endurance. And no car
can match its quality at the price.
Hudson-Essex economy includes not
only modest cost of operation and
maintenance, but the greatest of all
economies, freedom from repair
costs, low service charges, and
highest re-sale value.

J. WIX & SONS, LTD., London, England
“Cosine”: I recently read an article pity-
ing a new-chum for going thirsty in a scrub where
bottle-trees abound. Now, I have cut down hundreds
of bottle-trees during survey work on the Burnett
(Q-). and the only time I ever found water in one
was when the tree had rotted and a little rain had
collected in the hollow. But this happens in any
BLESSE OBLIGE.
“Look here, Jacky, if I let you come cadging
round, here too much, my husband says
he will divorce me!”
Don't worry, Missus; I wouldn’t mind
taking a risk with you meself!”
decayed tree which admits and holds rain-water.
Perhaps some member of the Council can tell me
how to get a drink in the bush. The only way I
know is to follow the gullies down till water is
found. That, by the way, is the only safe thing for
a townsman to do if properly bushed. It may take
some time, but will always land one at settlement,
besides giving the best chance of picking up tucker
en route and avoiding the greater danger of perish-
ing from thirst.
“Ida D.”: How is this for confidence in
one’s fellow-men ? The other day we met a horse
on the main road, ambling slowly along, and now
and then stopping to nibble the grass by the way-
side. He wore a large label tied round his neck
with string, and on it was printed in big letters;
“Don’t interfere with me; I’m going home. I’m
Charlie Robinson’s.”
“Herodot”: The lifting power of an Aus-
tralian eagle is remarkable, and out of all propor-
tion to its size and weight. Some time ago, on a
station near Walgett (N.S.W.), one of these birds
seized a lamb about 10 months old, and rose with
A BALLOT-BOX SEQUEL.
“Who’st ’ee vote for last Saturday, maister?”
“Only me and God’ll ever know that, Jan, an ’E would’n' knaw
if I could ’elp it.”
it, its talons hooked in the wool. It had made a
good ascent when a shot was fired at it from a
rifle, but without hitting it. Nevertheless it in-
santly released its prey, which was killed by the
fall. The eagle probably released its burden not
from inability to hold it, but to rise faster out of
range, for these birds are very cunning. Even full-
grown eats, generally more than a handful for any
other living creature of their own or approximate
size, have been carried off.
“G. Ure-Wright”: In the Boyne River district
(C.Q.) a wedge-tail eaglehawk, planing round a
selector’s residence, attracted the attention of a
half-bred fox-terrier accustomed to putting up tur-
keys. As the hawk flew the dog ran, barking furi-
ously. Suddenly the bird swooped down and grabbed,
hut the circling of the terrier caused him to miss.
Turning quickly he dived again, this time getting
his claws into the scruff of the dog’s neck. He
succeeded in raising him fully 3ft. clear of the
ground before the wriggling, snapping dog dropped.
The hawk, not appearing to understand matters,
settled low down on an adjacent blue-gum and eyed
the dog. Meanwhile the selector’s wife indoors drew
a bead on him through the window with a rifle, and
brought him to ground. The bird measured 7ft. 2in.
from tip to tip, and weighed 7 Jib. The dog weighed
251 b. I weighed both.
“Jesmond”; Recently twin boys came to
our farm for a holiday. To us they were as like
as two peas, but the cows found a difference between
them. They took no notice of one of the boys, but
when the other went near immediately became rest-
less. The first could stay in the yard all through
milking, but as soon as the other came in the herd
crowded round him bellowing and rooting up the
ground. If we had not sent him out the jerseys
would surely have rushed him. As both were dressed
alike it Was not their clothes which caused the
trouble. The only explanation I can think of is that
the boy’s personal “smell”—of which we were wholly
unconscious—was distinguished by the cows and
affected them adversely.

“Vosadina”: “New Grrnea dynamite” is
the name usually given to the root of the climbing
plant known as the tua, or tuha. The root is
crushed by the natives to a pulp. Their fishermen
then take it out to the reef where fins abound and
place it in a deep recess. It may then be pulled up
and taken to other recesses and allowed to remain
in each for a period of four or five minutes. The
effect of this is to impregnate the water, and the fish
swimming within its area become stupefied and rise
to the surface. The fisherman hastens to retrieve
them, for if he be tardy they will soon regain con-
sciousness and swim away. The pulpy root may be
used again ; between times it is kept in mud.
* * * *
“Fish Creek”: I have heard much talk of
pigskin saddles since I came to the bush; but no-
body seems to know where the pigskin comes from.
AYhat is the truth about it?
“Two Seas”: Cattlemen are often credited
with marvellous powers in correctly estimating the
weight of a live bullock, or, rather, what he will
weigh when dressed by the butcher. In a recent
Abo. par. it was stated that an experienced man
could guess the weight to a pound. He might, but
he would be the first
to admit that it was
a wonderful fluke. A
man killing the same
class of cattle on a
station every week or
two could probably
guess within 151 b. or
201 b. what any particu-
lar beast would weigh
“on the hooks,” but
the man isn’t born who
could correctly esti-
mate the dressed
weight of a bullock he
knew nothing about. A
beast fattened in a
particularly good pad-
dock will often weigh
501 b. more than another
the same size that has
been fattened upon
inferior pasture. As
the auctioneer remarks,
the former will “die
like lea d.” The
“gucss-his-weight-to-a-
pound” idea arises in
the townie’s mind from
reading the results of
the weight-guessing
competitions at agri-
cultural shows. I n
those gambles the
opinion of a good judge
of cattle is obtained
by his cousins, uncles
and aunts, and they
and their friends vary
his verdict by pounds
and half-pounds above
and below his estimate
—maybe for a hundred
pounds each way. Then,
when the result shows
that someone has
guessed the exact
weight of the animal,
the newspapers hold
forth upon the won-
derful skill displayed, although it may happen
that the winner has never seen a bullock except
at a show.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: In ringbarking, “Diggeroo”
says (B. 15/10i/’25) “the ideal is to get rid of the bark
cleanly without cutting into the sapwood.” Some
years ago I had to take meat on packhorses to about
20 ringbarking camps on a big cattle-run on the
Richmond River, and ride through the different areas
to see that there was no slumming. The contractors
had to make the bottom cut a little upwards, to pre-
vent suckering; the top cut didn’t matter, but where
the bark did not come off cleanly a bit of the sap-
wood had to be taken off with it. Thousands of
acres were rung in that part, and many of the land-
owners preferred to take off a hit of the sapwood
all round, as that made the growth of new hark im-
possible. Surveyors always cut below the sapwood
for the same reason. Usually, suckering occurs when
trees are rung at the wrong time of the year: the
trees die from the top downwards, not the other way
about.
* * * *
“Ida D.”: “Borom” says (B. 22/10./’25)
that the eucalypts of Arizona and California must be
well over 100 years old, by reasefh of their great
height. Yet the eucalyptus-trees in tlie avenues
of Monte Grande, near Buenos Aires, are of immense
height and girth, bigger than anything I have ever
seen on Monaro, and they are well within a
century old. I have spoken with men who remember
when Monte Grande was just pampa —no trees at
all. “Borom” also refers to red-guiiis in the Andes.
I have fossil leaves from the Valley of the Chubut,
an Andean river in Patagonia, obtained from the
sandstone cliffs at the edge of the river hank, and
they are identical in size, shape and veinings with
our gum-leaves!
“Bad Australian”: I have crossed the Andes by
every pass between Tingaririca and the Tropic of
Capricorn, but have never seen a red-gum growing
at a greater altitude than 1600 ft., although the
blue-gum was fairly common up to 5000 ft., and in
1907 I saw a solitary specimen standing like a
beacon over the massed vegetation of a little oasis
called Todonao in the heart of the desert of Atachma
about 9000 ft. above sea-level. These trees had been
propagated from seed brought over by the Chilian
wheat ships and Yankee whalers operating between
Australia and South America in the early days of
Australian settlement. I don’t know what method
“Borom” used in determining the age of standing
eucalypts, but I do know that any calculation based
on the height of the tree is apt to be wide of the
mark. Some years ago 1 saw gum-trees growing in
the main plaza at Mendoza, Argentina, which had
attained an altitude of 90ft. 15 years after planting.
These trees were grown under irrigation in a
climate similar to that of Arizona. Probably the
trees in Nogales and San Jose were grown under
similar conditions.
“C.H.R.”: The eucalyptus goes far afield. There
is a fine tree in the garden of a house called Clon-
manon in county AA’icklow, reputed to be
the only one in Ireland. It may have come from
Australia, as the Truell family, who own the house,
had some connection with this country years ago.
“1.L.1.”: Tile mountain pigs of N.Q. are
more than a trifle wild. Their ancestors were liber-
ated by Captain Cook, and in their years cf evolu-
tion have grown a powerful bod} - and possess six-
to eight-inch tusks and an arrogant disposition,
Tney roam mostly through the precipitous coastal
range, where, with niggers, dogs and rifles, the
Outhackers hunt them for meat. To bail up a pig
in its jungle without trained dogs is almost impos-
sible and certainly unsafe. This explains why in
that country inaccessible for the transit of stores
a good “pig-dog” is prized above coin by both
whites and niggers. If a .32 bullet catches the
pig square between its two eyes, all is well; if not,
then the hunter must rapidly fire again or make a
run for it. Several dogs will try to grip an ear,
cunningly pressing their bodies tight against the
massive shoulder so that the upward thrusting tusks
cannot gouge their bellies. A cunning dog will
tackle the prey’s rear and as the pig surges round
on his unreachable tormentor the hunter has his
chance for an escape. Some of the boars grow to
3cwt., and the hide on their shoulders is an inch
thick.
* * * *
“Herodot”: It would seem to be almost
outside the hounds of biological probability that
breeding could take place between a mare and a
hull, and that the offspring of such a union could
form a definite type or variety of its own, with
uniform and distinct features. Yet two instances
are on record in Australia ; one occurred in the
Kosciusko district (N.S.W.) about 20 years ago,
and the other in Victoria more recently. The pro-
duct of the union, known as a “jumart,” generally
possesses the massive lines of its sire and the dis-
tinctive form of its dam, and at-first sight resembles
a horse more closely than it does a bull. From
the point of view of use little can be done with
such an animal, the fact that it seems to possess no
physical strength or stamina rendering it unfit for
usual tasks, although the owner of one of the hybrids
once utilised it in a team, where for a time it ren-
dered fairly satisfactory service.
* * * »
“Up Top”: In the days of my innocent
youth I matched my guile against the cunning of the
crow. The prize was 6d. per nob, offered by the local
Pastures Protection Board. With a great display of
camp-fire smoke I breakfasted in an open space among
the bloodwood-trees. A crow flopped along and
settled in a tall tree overhead, apparently taking not
the slightest interest in my business. He shrank
himself to half his size and remained as immobile
as the dead branch on which he rested. Between
bites of damper and cold mutton I ostentatiously
threw lumps of gristle and fat around the camp-fire.
Then unconcernedly I threw away some poisoned
meat scraps, and picking up my rifle walked ofi
among the trees. A few minutes later from my
STRATEGY.
ANXIOUS FRIEND: “ Turn ag’in the wind,
Joe; turn ag'in the wind.”
hiding-place I watched the crows congregate around
the sentinel. He answered their verbal inquiries
with a few bored quawks. The flock at once
volplaned to the camp-fire, and I counted my pros-
pective sixpences. The black scavengers strolled
leisurely among the scraps, cursorily inspected the
baits, passed on and contemptuously scoffed all the
damper crusts. After which they flew leisurely away,
having given me my first lesson in the cunning of
the wild.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was on the twenty-first of June
From Liverpool we set sail.
Chorus: Old Noah was born a rover!
And Neptune he did favor us
With a fair and gentle gale.
Chorus: Blow high and blow us over!
Bold Daniel was our captain brave
On board of the Saucy Jane.
Chorus: We’re sons of Mother Cary — o!
Sailed by a crew of husky men
Bound out for the Spanish Main.
Chorus: Oh, the rum is fine and the girls all shine
on the shores of Port Malario!
When we dropped our hook at Malario
Our cargo we did discharge.
Oh, the Polls on the pier are crying!
We soon filled up with another one
That was quite as good an’ large.
An’ our old blue Peter’s flyin’.
Then the skipper he mustered us aft
An’ unto us all did say
(Oh, there’s wine an’ women in Cadiz!):
“Here’s money to spend to-night, me lads,
For to-morrow we’re bound away!”
We’ve signed to go, though we love you so; farewell,
ye Limehouse ladies !
We were three days out from Malario
When a pirate hove in sight.
Ilcave me, lads, for your bunk an’ crust!
He broke his flag, an’ fired a gun
That scared our black cook white.
Oh, growl we may, but work we must!
Bold Daniel stood at the after-rail,
Said lie “My lads, stand by!
(Oh, sky pilots have a notion)
We’ve got to trick tnis pirate king
Or we j shall surely die.”
11 hen shellbacks die their spirits fly across the
Western Ocean!
The pirate had the weather gage
And overhauled us fast.
The cool: on the fore-sheet haulin’!
Bold Daniel ordered us to swing
Our mainyards to the mast.
And our bluenose bo’sn’s bawlin’!
With grapplin'-Trons fore an’ aft
The pirate laslied us tight.
Oh, Alphonso was no sailor!
Then up our sides the villains swarmed
All eager for the fight.
Alphonso died, lie gat. shanghied for a trip in a
Yankee whaler!
But as old Skull and Crossbones jumped
Our rail with all his crew
(Fair gales and strainin’ leaches!)
We sprang aboard the pirate ship
And cut their lashings through.
Warm winds and sunny beaches!
AVe dipped our flag an’ left ’em there
To sink beneath the main.
Farewell, white cliffs of Dover!
For Daniel smashed her boats an’ gear
And scuttled the Saucy Jane.
Oh, blow us down to Sydney town where sailors live

Tli.' Battle of Poppies was waged by Miss
Sydney against all-comers on Armistice Day
from the widest-flung suburb to Central Rail-
way Station, and from the tiniest pier on
Port Jackson to the Quay. Fathers, mothers,
sisters and brothers wore the crimson em-
blem of those Flanders fields where seven
years ago a weary world dreamed Peace
had been re-born. But if the peace we
dreamed of has not come to us with victory,
war has left an aftermath that Australia
must not neglect. So for the maimed, the
T.B. and the shell-shocked, the poppy and
the shilling changed hands with amazing
rapidity. Even the man who feeds the lions
at the Zoo wore one, and this letter saw
one tucked into the collar of a rheumaticky
old collie at the Quay.
The girls in their poppy-embroidered
aprons were out bright and early with their
trays, one of the quickest off the mark being
State Governor de Chair’s daughter. Mayor-
ess Cecilia Walsh, in wistful mauves, had
charge of the Town Hall area; Mrs. England
and Mrs. Leo Quick were among the battlers;
and a horde of kilted buccaneers from Para-
mount and Hoyt’s held up the railway sta-
tion. Dot Bruliton, Ailsa Grahame. Maud
Fane, leaders of the Cheer-ohs, Mrs. Bennett
White, crowds of pretty Sydney girls and a
pretty one from Melbourne, Valerie Purves,
were other coin-collectors.
At midday the city snatched two minutes’
silence for remembrance. And above that
silence, heavy with sorrow, sounded aloof,
remote, the clang of a hammer. Was
it a hammer, or the spirit of industry re-
minding this laughing country that Peace and
Construction must walk hand in hand?
The big dance of Armistice evening was
the one in aid of the Limbless Soldiers’ fund.
This was held at Dungowau, in Martin-place,
and Mayoress Cecilia Walsh was president
of a committee of enthusiasts. Poppies were
the recurring notes in the decorations, and
old soldiering tunes gave inspiration to the
band. Midway through the evening graceful
Gladys Talma, as the Spirit of Peace, took
the floor surrounded by eight handmaids
dressed as poppies. Mayoress Cecilia had
scarcely unwound the scarf of silver that
encompassed her lavender georgettes than
she gathered in a presentation poppy of
great size with a quaint vanity-box tucked
into its heart. Mrs. P. F. Loughlin, who was
in the civic train, came in quiet black geor-
gettes. Florrie Howard, a strenuous worker
in many good causes, was pink-iced, while
Peg Parkinson turned a gilded self to the
night, which composer Murray Gibbs
threaded through with his own songs.
The Wentworth, too, staged a special revel
on Armistice night; and a practical note of
appreciation was struck by the man-
agement in the table novelties —quaint
dolls and other trophies made by re-
turned soldiers. Peace dolls decorated
every table, and special brands of them were
given as prizes for the dance competitions.
The Union Jack and our own starred
emblem fluttered from the balcony; below
them a group of Ist Battalion Signallers
held a reunion, and presently to the almost-
forgotten strains of “Tipperary” slim young
girls and their soldier-boys swung across the
ballroom floor.
Society’s seventh wave last week was the
marriage of the Chief Justice Knoxes’
Margaret to Brian Poole, now of Armidale,
formerly of Shropshire (Eng.). The bride
had decided on the sunny afternoon hours
and St. John’s, in Darlingliurst (it’s just
round the corner from her own home), for
the adventure. The old church bloomed into
aisles of liliesi, and the young bride herself
suggested the ,'iily of Astolat in a happy end-
ing. Her ivory satin frock hung straight
ij ol *"’ front drape clasped by a plait
ot gold and silver, ending in the tassel be-
loved at the moment by dress-designers. It
also drew a f georgette train, glistening with
silver and gold embroideries. Her mother’s
wedding vej 1 of Brussels lace enfolded her,
and the oface again popular ivory-backed
prayer-bool: was carried instead of a bou-
T lct - Five maids, sister Elizabeth, Morna
MacCormWck, Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow,
Helen Stephen and Molly Street, all in their
teens, sparkled from mists of delpliinium-
blue georgettes, wearing godets and shoulder-
scarves in the most correct and alluring
fashion. Their crinoline hats evoked an
ardent ‘stare from girl lookers-on. These hats
were of delphinium-blue, and their brims wore
tiny tulle frills shaded from the bluest-blooded
delphinium to the shy, pale one of the
family. There was a tiny blue thistledown
of a cousin, Meg Icely, who scattered petals
on the bridal path. The Chief Justice of
Australia squired liis daughter to the tryst,
Padre Micklem put the questions, and sweet-
voiced choristers did the rest. Geoffrey
Clark best-manned, and others who sustained
the bridesmaids were Captain A. E. Knox,
Captain Lawrence Geoffrey Bettington and
lan Maclean. A reception at Osterley, in
Macleay-street, the Knox home, drew the
Knox kindred, the Fairfaxes, the State Chief
Justice Streets, the Surgeon MacCormicks
(with just-wed daughter Airs. John Martin),
about-to-wed Janet Harvey and hosts of
others. In the evening Knight Adrian and
his lady gave a dinner-dance at the Ambas-
sadors to the maids and groomsmen.
An alliance between the turf and the
theatre is promised by the engagement of
Josie Seaton, of Waverley (her people are
interested in racing), to Ben Fuller, son
of knight Ben.
A just-back-from-London friend says that
all the most expensive evening frocks have
discarded the very elongated top which made
every woman look short-legged; they now
wear their seam close to the old waist-line
and have many gathers round about. Satin
and chiffon and black-and-gold lame are the
correct materials, though a mixture of silver
and gold lame finds favor with many. So
does elaborately-jewelled lace; and for next
winter the popularity of thickly-ribbed silk
repp is predicted. If you are a real fashion-
able you have an evening-ooat specially de*-
signed for each frock, and if you are ultra-
smart your garments are “named." For in-
stance, your fur-lined coat (you wear your
silver-fox now even as the cloud wears its
silver lining) may be named the pretty
equivalent of bankruptcy, while the pansy-
purple georgette hundred-guinea rag under-
neath will be known as Heartsease.
Rod Quinn’s friends and admirers are

his birthday. Rod, who is one of our sweet-

that some fund must be instituted to assure
him of comfort in his remaining years. Aliss

Randwick, is secretary of the movement, and
Alayor Stokes is its president.
The lady who sat for this Falk picture
is Airs. Selina Cheeke, who can remember
George-street a bullock-track and Darling-
hurst a thicket of native bush. A daughter
of William
Long, she
claims Sydney
as her birth-
place ; so did
he r mother,
who was born
on the day of
the Battle of
Waterloo. Mrs.
Cheeke got her
first glimpse
of life through
the windows
of a rambling,
garden - girt
cottage built
where the rail-
way station is
n o w, and
when a tiny
girl her home
was Tusculum
House, at
Potts Point,
once a residence of Bishop Broughton. Liv-
ing up Macleay-street way was like living
in the heart of the bush ; the nearest houses
were the old Dangar, Gilchrist and Macleay
homes, whose grounds, like those of Tus-
culum, spread mightily. Every family in
the neighborhood was armed with a police-
man’s rattle. The weapon was used during
the day-time chiefly by noisy small hopes of
tiie different families, but at night-time, if
one family was alarmed by robbers, or by
robber noises, it was the Lord of the Manor
who seized it, popped his niglit-capped head
out of a window and sent off an alarm signal.
Then the other householders rattled off an
answer to show they were wide awake. The
midnight prowlers were never slow to take
the hint, and the worst thing that ever
happened in the Long household were two
broken windows on the ground floor. Having
duly had her coming-out ball at Government
House (as did all the belles of her day),
the young Australian, still in her early teens,
married George, a nephew of Justice Cheeke
who had left the navy to become his cele-
brated uncle’s associate. There was a great
line of fashionable coaches outside St.
James’s that day, and the wedding dinner
given at Government House (by the Bel-
mores) was the function of the week. The
Judge was one of the lads in his day, and
won the first Australian Derby with his
horse Clove.
It was Justice Cheeke, too, wlio tried the
unfortunate O’Farrell, who made a picnic
at Clontarf historic by shooting at the Duke of
Edinburgh. Mrs. Clieeke, very blue of eye,
will tell you of the ceremonial of setting out
for that day’s picnic. She w T as not only
present, but an eye-witness of the shooting.
Some of the gayest parties, Mrs. Cheeke de-
clares with reminiscent laughter, w r ere given
by the Charles Wentworths at Vaucluse
House. And when the patriot (he was looked
upon as just a jolly, rather downright man
by his contemporaries) was having one of
his famous parties, the road from the
town was gay with family coaches, along-
side which many a gallant rode dashingly,
for the moon and the wistaria were not dis-
dained even then as atmosphere in a wooing.
As a girl Mrs. Cheeke saw Port Jackson
flash wonderingly about the first steamer to
enter the Heads, and remembers still the
thrill of excitement that went through the
community when the captain issued the
cards for the inevitable party.
Back on a visit to Sydney (she has been
for many years in Europe) Mrs. Cheeke is
living with her son Oswald in a cottage at
Darling Point, built on what was originally
the rose-garden of Woollalira House —her
first home as a bride.
An innovation that is likely to catch on
these sultry nights was the trafficking of
lucky fans instead of lucky caps at the
Y.A.L. ball the other night. The Wentworth
housed the function, which was engineered
by Muriel Herbert, whose frock even re-
flected the blush of achievement —it was of
rosy satins allied to silvery lace and fur
frontiers. Literally hundreds of women and
men danced and revolved, looking as though
indulging in some new form of' vapor-bath.
Mrs. Charles Hotham was president, and the
committee included Town-clerk Layton,
Clifford Hay, 11. C. Budge and Brigadier-
General Lloyd. Mrs. A. C. Godhard, who
was Mona Daley, tore herself away from
the Melbourne gaieties to be present, flash-
ing a black creation which featured pointed
panels of rhinestones. Mrs. Layton folded
herself in black georgettes embroidered in
steel, and new director of the Y.A.L. E. P.
Marie was one of a large party hostessed by
Mrs. A. E. Spence, w r ho dressed her act in
rich mauve. Dot Brunton popped along
after she’d shut up the Music Box looking
like a delectable ‘ raspberry ice. Guy Bates
Post, too, had a turn at the roundabouts,
and Mrs. McC. Johnston’s profile caught the
eye of Dame Fortune, her fan bearing the
magic number which won the bauble.
The Italian colony celebrated Armistice
Day and the 25th anniversary of Victor
Emmanuel’s accession to the throne in one
big burst at Sargent’s. Laurel-wreathed
Italy’s Majesty smiled down on his subjects
whom the mirrored wall presented in flatter-
ing multitudes. Dr. Fiasciii. who is presi-
dent of the League, was the man of the
hour, and Mrs. Fiasehi wore jubilant pink
georgettes and vellum lace draperies. Dr.
Marie Bentivoglio flared in green and silver,
and singer Jeannette Ethelston flooded one
of the dance intervals with song.
Many and queer are the strings that pull
trade. This Letter’s suburban newsagent
lately laid in a heavy stock of black cats,
Felixes and Charlie Chaplins in the form
of brooches in expectation of the Christmas
examinations. Few student flappers will sit
nowadays without one of these talismans,
and judging by the sales Charlie Chaplin is
expected to be the most efficacious.
Sydney is to hear good-looking Rene Max-
well’s sweet pipe again on Saturday night
in the Town Hall. This is Rene’s first
recital since her home-coming, and her pro-
gramme will include some of the most
thistledown of coloratura, as well as Bach,
Schubert and Bax compositions. With her
is associated the Russian violinist Cliuhaldin,
who comes to Sydney from the Moscow
Imperial Orchestra by way of the Revolu-
tion. He’s a man of resource, this musician.
When the Soviet took over Russian affairs
and only paper-money (which really didn’t
buy anything) was exchanged for music,
Chulialdin became a cobbler. He learned to
mend and make boots so well that in ex-
change he got ration-tickets, which meant
real food. He brings from Adelaide and
Melbourne a sheaf of laudations for his con-
certs in those cities.
Originality curls among the grey matter of
somebody on the committee that is out to
help St. Mark’s Home. To begin with, in-
stead of calling their afternoon dance a
cabaret, they have named it a matinee ball.
Another difference is the Dance of the Cards.
If you are placarded with an ace of hearts
you look for another ace of hearts, while
the diamonds, the clubs and the spades are
doing likewise. The 26tli of this month; and
tickets are at the Wentworth and Paling’s.
Half a dozen of the rooms in the Con.
will be given over to locums next year. A
number of the staff seem to have been struck
at the same moment with the necessity of a
few months’ polishing up in London or Paris.
Frank Hutchens, though, is going to America.
Frank, who spends his evenings stiffening up
the programmes of fellow-musicians’ recitals
or charity concerts, looked badly in need of
a rest at the two-piano recital given by him
and Bindley Evans last week. These two
pianists work in the most complete harmony,
and their programmes of Bach, Bauer, Mozart,
Rubinstein and Franck was _ chosen in a
masterly manner. Dr. Garrick’s wife, in the
fashionable skirt-abbreviations and long-
distance wdiite kid gloves, opened floodgates
of song over the audience.
This sleek, dark head is the top-piece of
Bessie Blake, who threatens to become an Aus-
tralian Galli-Curci. Her voice has the true col-
oratura qual-
ity, and though
she has studied
singing only
two and a half
years, she pre-
sented a pro-
gramme at her
recital a few
weeks ago such
as a mature
artist might
sing. Of course,
during her
study she has
been every day
under the guid-
ance of her
teaclK'r, Di
Giorgio, an el
he is now
looking for-
ward to the
time when he
can say “Pack
yonr boxes, you are ready to study opera
in Europe.” An aptitude for languages, a
sound musical knowledge and a memory that
seems never to let go are other gifts the
fairies brought to the lucky girl's christening.
The University Women’s Social Service
Club, founded in the dark ages by Governor
Jersey’s wife with the twofold purpose of
helping the poor families living in the shadow
of the hall of learning and providing women
students with the chance to study welfare
work, is at last to have a home of its own.
Bellevue House, which commands an extensive
vista of Edward-street, Chippendale, lias been
bought, and here the mothers, girls and kiddies
who are members of the society will be given
lessons in handicrafts and provided with all
sorts of improving lectures. The kiddies
will have their special play afternoons, and
the subscription is Id. a week.
Marguerite Mazengarb, the Maoriland girl
with the strong sense of the dramatic and the
vivid method of transmitting it, will give her
second recital in Sydney at the Adyar Hal!
on November 24. Gerald Waleun and Gladys
Hart are her reinforcements.
Miss Brisbane’s N.B.: —
A dull Derby Day brought out sombre frocking,
huddled under raincoats, with touches of brightness
on chapeaux. The Hon. Bill Lennon decorated the
winner, Wee Glen, Fred Ryder being in attendance.
Among the crowd were seen Mrs. Donald Cameron
in black and canary, Mrs. L. C. Wilson in
amber, Mrs. Alfred Needham —she is just back from
Die Cold Country—in black with touches of saxe,
and Mrs. Cecil Palmer flying bits of red on her
sable frock.
Thursday’s racing saw the gathering of bright
summer frocks at Ascot. Just-returned Mrs. Robert
Thompson showed some lace fresh from Paris on
her sand georgette with blue ribbon panels. Mrs.
Eric Molle and Mrs. Eric Manson wore white,
Irma Dearden chose china-blue, and Cecily Cadell
Garrick grey, with a blue hat. Mrs. Isaac Moore
poured tea for a select few in the members’ room.
Wynberg, New Farm —the old residence of the
J. C. Willcocks, now the home of Archgaiters Duhig
—was dressed up for a coin afternoon for the
Christian Brothers’ appeal. There were sports for
the kiddies on the lawn, and Winnie Trackson, V.
Burke and Beres Corrie helped with the music.
The Jireli kirk was set with flags, larkspur and
lilies for the annual gathering of the veterans. The
oldest woman present was Mrs. H. S. Brackett, born
in London and not out at 91. Mr. Lane, from
England’s Kent, was the oldest man, at 92. Mrs.
Fowdon, at 70, claimed to be the oldest woman born
in Queensland, and Mr. Langtree the oldest man —he
is 79. The best record was put up by Mrs. Sagar.
She boasted vigorously of having spent 73 years in
our debilitating climate.
On Sunday night the Savage Club supped some
of the principals in “Snap,” Hector St. Clair, Jack
Cannot, Vera Spaull, Yvonne Banvard and Danby
being amongst them. Freddy Homer and Mildred
Bell sang, and there was jazz with other Bohemian
antics.
Freda Bage has been showing Sir Frank Heath
and his wife round the Women’s College. Mrs.
Cumbrae Stewart, in rose-pink, hostessed a party
for Lady Heath in a setting of beautiful carnations.
There were many dons and their other halves to say
how d’y’do to the wife of the visiting scientist.
St. David’s Society dropped in at Brisbane’s gaol
the other afternoon to cheer the inmates with some
Welsh melody. Before the concert the president in-
quired, through the gaol superintendent, if there
were any Taffies among the audience. The only
response was from a Chinaman, who arose with a
full CelestiSl smile and claimed the honor.
Warwick is getting ready to celebrate the cen-
tenary of the Darling Downs. Botanist Allan Cun-
ningham pushed into this locality in 1827, and ever
since then it has been telling itself that it is the
garden of Queensland.

Armistice Day, with its two-minute laying-
down of tools in memory of those who made
the great sacrifice, was celebrated with due
decorum. Eleven o’clock tea was left cool-
ing as folk rallied to the various memorial
services. The chief centre was the steps of
Federal Parliament House. Here were the
G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven, Governor
Stradbroke and daughter Helena, all paying
their tribute as the Last Post rang over the
hushed city. Poppy wreaths hung upon
honor-rolls, and soldiers’ relatives sold the
red flower for the benefit of the Anzac
Memorial Building and the children of the
A.I.F. An energetic vendor was Crimean
veteran Sergeant-Major Gamble, whose years
are claimed to be 106. The poppy sales
approached a record, £l5OO or thereabouts.
The city pedestrian has done some fairly
generous giving within the past few weeks,
for both the Mayor’s Hospital Fund and St.
Vincent’s Hospital have had a begging. The
plea of “buy a souvenir button for St. Vin-
cent’s” added £2500 to the institution’s
appeal fund; and the Mayor’s street patrol
of collection boxes lifted about £3OOO. The
whole month’s asking for his hospitals gave
Councillor Brunton a cheque in the vicinity
of £32,000.
Welcomes to the new G.-G. and Lady
Stonehaven, held up during the Cup delirium,
burst forth again with a dinner given by
president James Barrett and members of the
Royal Colonial Institute. The Hotel Wind-
sor’s tables were adorned for the occasion
with a wealth of pink and deep-red roses,
over which Howard Hitchcock, of Geelong,
echoed the sentiments of greeting expressed
by the chairman. Lady Stonehaven listened-
in in black lace and white tulle. The Barrett
dame had a jade-green scarf above a gown
of silver brocade, and Dr. Edith of the same
family lit up some black apparel with gold
flowers.
Though there was a heat haze on the sky-
line, the diaphanous raiment on the lawns
at Caulfield on Saturday did not equal in
brilliance the Cup display. The coolest-
Jooking creature viewed was in an apple-
green georgette with a floating cape allied
to a flower-wreathed tagel hat, and the
weirdest was in black with deep flounces of
shaded orange lace, topped by a cartwheel
headpiece enwreathed with blossoms. The
vice-regal pen held the G.-G. and Lady
Stonehaven, she wearing handkerchief frills
of black and green depending from a tuniced
bodice beneath a black coat; her small hat
dangled a scarf of black tulle. Mrs. Pitt
Rivers was swathed in twine-hued silk lace
above georgette, and mauve tulips rested
upon her green crin. hat. Miss Clive Leon-
ard, wife of the chairman of the V.A.T.C.,
had vellum-toned georgette, and her gold lace
straw hat was banded with black velvet.
The H. S. K. Ward and Le Roy Burnham
matrons were in raiment of the favored
shade of ficelle. Mrs. R. S. Whiting looked
dainty in black and white chiffon and black
and silver plumage. Mrs. Rosenthal, who
aired ivory georgette with embroideries in
yellows and browns and dabs of Belgian fur
upon her old-gold satin lid, shared dress
honors with Mrs. Leslie Benjamin, who was
in begonia tone, a true-lovers’ knot of bril-
liants upon her upturned hat being the only
break in the color scheme. Mrs. Barry
Thomson, in ensemble suit of grey georgette
with steel beading, watched her pretty black
colt Switzerland finish second in its maiden
effort. A unique happening of the day was
the unpopular win of King of Mirth in the
Armadale Cup. when the favorite jockey
Dempsey had to listen to his mount being
vigorously hooted.
Melbourne’s peaceful streets were dis-
turbed on Sunday morning by newsboys
crying extras, although there is a law in our
saintly city against Sabbath journals. It
was the only conspicuously lawless outburst
of the election.
Theatricals and musicians went garden-
partying at State Government House the
other afternoon, Governor Stradbroke and
his Countess giving glad welcome to those
who have so often lent a kindly hand for
charity. The ladies of the stage were all in
their very best bib and tucker, and Claude
Flemming upheld the male magnificence of
the boards with a top hat, frock coat and
accessories. Lady Stradbroke had lace dra-
peries over her black georgette and crin.
millinery, and Lady Helena Rous displayed
water-lilies upon her picture hat, and her
hydrangea mauve gown was patterned with
roses. May Beatty was a froth of fawn
georgette and lace, and Madge White, who
will be seen in Sydney some day as Cin-
derella’s prince, was in ecru lace and a blue-
velvet-ribboned hat. The Tallis dame brought
daughter Biddy in a hois de rose ensemble
suit fur-trimmed; Charlton Morton came
with his attractive wife, and Jimmy “Smith”
Godden’s lady friends all answered present.
The guests wandered about the lawn, viewed
the fine aviary and sat beneath shady trees
while the band made pleasant sounds, and
Freddy Carpenter balanced ices and teacups
as dexterously as he trips it in “Archie.”
Captain Matthew Flinders, R.N., now
gazes in bronze from the prow of his boat
upon the traffic of the Melbourne street
named after him. Lord Stradbroke unveiled
Web Gilbert’s ettigy of the great navigator.
The cloaking Union Jack flapped in the
chilly breeze before thousands of onlookers,
whose interest was transferred from the sea-
man of the past to the seamen of the present
who marched along Flinders-street bound
for the Yarra Bank to the strains of “Soli-
darity for Ever,” played by a socialists’
band which drowned his Excellency’s speech
entirely. A male voice behind this Chatterer
murmured “What loafer is speaking nowV”
“Can’t sec anything of him but a lot of
war medals,” replied his friend with a
laugh, and the two sauntered off to join the
straggling procession. James Barrett and
Admiral Hall Thompson paid their tributes
to Flinders, and also to the genius of the
late sculptor, whose widow was a listener ;
Mayor Brunton handed the memorial over to
the safe keeping of the Cathedral Chapter,
on whose behalf it was received by Arch-
bishop Lees, and from the Cathedral steps
the surpliced choir raised voices in a fine
setting by Dr. A. E. Floyd of “Let Us
Now Praise Famous Men.”
A jolly little military hop happened at the
Engineer Depot, Alexandra-avenue, the hosts
of which were Major-General Johnston and
the officers of the 3rd Division Artillery and
the 4th, 10tli and 15th Infantry Brigades,
with Lieut.-Colonel Lorenzo as organiser.
Among the steppers were General Chauvel
and his lady, whose frock was blue and
glistened with beads; Colonel Rupert
Downes and his wife, who was gowned in
violet-hued crepe marocain ; Mrs. Stevenson,
who brought her Colonel; and many majors
and minors and their feminine relations.
Governor Stradbroke went out to New-
market horse sales last week nrepared to
sing the Arab's farewell to Night Patrol, but
an offer of £7OOO failed to tempt. So the
champion will stand by until the vice-regals
book their passages next year. Meantime
Martin Stainforth is to put its arching neck
and flashing eye on canvas.
Clifford Orme, here pictured by Lafayette,
came this way from S’Africa to earn a crust

ture with Syd

E x c ellency's
card with numbers of two selected purchases

search of the key. and no doubt enjoyed the
experience of having the show to himself.
To buy Christmas cheer and gifts for patients
of the Alfred Hospital, the Barry Thomson,
11. J. Robertson and Maurice Batkin matrons
engineered a cafe chantant in the Oriental
setting of the York tearooms in York House.
The function, which had the support of the
entertainments committee of the institution,
drew a full house, and some raffles and sales
of flowers added to the loot. Cake and tea
went down to the music-making of Muriel
Benton, Marie Bremner, Alice Madigan and
Harold Rodgers, flautist Leslie Barklam and
others. Matron Mann, Mrs. ,T. W. Spring-
tliorpe, Mrs. C. N. Finn and her sister Eileen
Castles, Miss May Rimmington (who is
packing her pretties for her trip to London
in December) and Mrs. Howard Jolley were
among the patrons.
Members of the Alliance Francaise and
friends foregathered at a diner dansant at
Cockerton’s picturesque resort on Saturday
night. Secretary Pierre Kerry directed the
cheer, and even if some of the guests couldn’t
say in in French, all were at home in synco-
pated rhythm.
As a sort of ambassador from the artists
of the Harbor City, Sydney Ure Smith
made his way to Melbourne a little over a
week ago, bringing with him a bronze
medal, designed by Rayner Hoff, to present
to John Connell, than whom Australian art
has had few kindlier patrons. “The Connell
Collection” in the National Gallery is only
one part of his service. There was a gather-
ing of artists to celebrate the occasion, but
the attempt to lure the shy patron to a
place where, to the accompaniment of food,
lie would have to listen to his own praises,
failed. However, the nice things that had
to be said about him were fired off at the
Ritz, Julian Ashton helping Urff Smith in
the shooting.
Douglas Richardson, artist and sculptor,
just elected president of the Vic. Artists’
Society, has
been an Aus-
sie since he
was five, when
his parents
came this way
from England.
He was one of
the first stu-
dents enrolled
at the National
Gallery. Later
he completed
the course of
six years at
the R.A.
schools, Lon-
don, and
reached a pin-
nacle on which
he stands alone
by gaining the
Armytage first
pri z e s for
painting and sculpture in the same year, ire
is represented in the Melbourne National
Gallery, and Bendigo has a marble group
executed for its golden jubilee. A stroll
around this city will show you some of his
best work. His wife is Margaret Baskerville,
who has also carved out fame with a chisel.
Dickenson-Monteatli did the picture.
Bach was the offering at Ivinnoull the
other night, when Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, in fussy
frocking of white taffeta, with inlets of
powder-blue, greeted her guests in the sub-
dued glow of candles. The music-makers
included Fielden, of the R.A.M., Annie Cad-
dell, Millie McCormack, Jean Ilambleton and
Bernard Heinze. Many of Melbourne’s music
patrons listened to the numbers presented
with an artistic background of rhododendrons
and feathery bamboo.
Woman is coming into her own in the
libraries of Melbourne ’Varsity. The old
identity, Prank Gladish, who has been
medical librarian for half a century, is
resigning next month in favor of Miss Peggy
Wardell, late of the Speck. The big job
of cataloguing the whole 30,000 volumes is
being tackled by Miss Pan Matthews, a
Sydney Uni. girl.
Society was bidden to take afternoon tea
and have its fortune told to the accompani-
ment of a string orchestra at the Herbert
Sargood mansion, at Toorak, last week. The
hostess, whose gown of navy blue was needle-
run with ivory silk, added picture millinery
to tone: her daughter, Mrs. Arthur Deben-
ham, who helped with the welcoming hand,
wore an ensemble suit of the new pink hue.
Most of Melbourne’s fore-handled met the
merely plain missus and miss of the much
gilded in rose-decked reception- and dining-
rooms.
The one-time cyclorama and hippodrome
will see yet another change when its long-
closed doors will open to disclose a Paddy’s
market under the sign of the Opportunity
Shop. The venture, which is an inspiration
of George Tallis’s enterprising wife, is to
receive the formal kick-off to-day at 3 o’clock,
and St. Vincent’s Hospital appeal reaps the
benefit. Folks will have the chance of secur-
ing bargains at the shop from 10 a.m. until
5 p.m. daily from next Friday as long as
the overflowing supplies hold out.
A running bowline linked Dorothy Brewis,
eldest daughter of Captain C. R. Brewis,
C.8.E., R.N., with Lieut.-Commander R. L.
Hastings McNish, captain of the N.Z. Co.'s
Kaikoura. The lady faced the music in
vellum lace, a veil of old Bruges and a sheaf
of lilies. Sister Iris was in attendance, wear-
ing pink tulle over ivory net and pink. The
happy couple expect to home-keep in Eng-
land.
Manufacturers of feminine etceteras are
bent upon making life dull for woman this
season. All is to be shaded. Ombre is what
they term this transition from vivid to
neutral hues. Hats, tulle and airy scarves,
lace, fringe, hose and even dress stuffs follow
the craze. Not a very happy one; though,
after all, a shaded present may be better
than a shady past.
A reproving Scot burrs in this (bat-
terer’s ear:—
Nae, nae ! Captain Broadhurst, Lord Stonehaven s
Chamberlain, doesn't wear a busby. »o Highlander
wears a busby—he wears a feather bonnet. -or
yet does he wear kilts. He wears a kilt, or the kit,
the same as the fair sex wears, only one skirt or
dress at a time. The Chatterer calls a Scotsman a
Scotchman. Nae, nae! Scotch kippers, Scotch had-
docks, Scotch oatmeal if ye like, but never a
Scotchman. Captain lan Hay, of the Black Watch,
ought to have been sent to us. He is < ft. 4in.
and the tallest man in the army.
Melbourne’s sailing season having opened,
the white wings gather around St Kilda and
Brighton at the week-ends and float out to
the Bay. Walsh can’t hold them up, at any
rate, although one yachtsman had liis harm-
less little craft declared black when it was
in dry dock being painted for the season.
Now is the time to look in at the Red
Cross Handicrafts Depot in Queen’s Walk
where blind and invalid soldiers’ clever work
is for sale. Christmas time is the period for
settling debts, and our bill with our credi-
tors of the A.I.F. is not receipted yet.
The wind-up of the Wirths’ Circus season
took the usual happy form of an invitation
performance before members of the- Friendly
Union of Soldiers’ AVives and Mothers and
members of the Sailors and Soldiers’
Mothers’ Association. The vice-regal reserve
held Lady Stonehaven with her two small
daughters, Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers and her
boys, Mrs. Hall Thompson and General
Chauvel and his wife and their girleen. Her
Ex. handed the brethren the thanks of the
entertained in an artistic address. The com-
mittee passed around tea and ices during
the interval, the Glasgow and Syme ladies,
Mrs. ATctor Sellheim and Mrs. Bracegirdle
being among the hostesses.
The Exhibition houses at present a
children’s welfare show, which features
every phase of the Australian kid’s activities
in kindergartens, missions, orphanages, hos-
pitals, creches, aid societies and children's
leagues. The Boy Scouts show’ a well set-
up camp, and the newsboys the carpentry
and wood-carving produced at their club,
bookcases and intricately-fashioned brackets
being specially noteworthy. The Minister-
ing Children’s League, which maintains the
Cottage by the Sea at Queenscliff as a con-
valescent home for poor children, has beauti-
fully-made infants’ garments, table linen and
prettily-dressed dolls for sale, chiefly contri-
buted by young people. Demonstrations in-
numerable include life-saving stunts and
safety-first campaigns and the propaganda
of the State Savings Bank to encourage
thrift. Many big firms occupy spaces fea-
turing exhibits that bear on the welfare phy-
sically or mentally of the rising generation.
A gentle reminder that folks haven’t yet paid
one debt is to be found in the Soldiers’ Red
Cross handicrafts section and in the exhibi-
tion of furniture made by disabled me; of
the A.1.F.; the hand-made Anzac tweeds fit
in here too.
Mary Chomley has looked in on us after
six years’ absence. The lady, who dabbles
in art, now resides in the Great Smoke.
Having been lion. see. of the Victoria League
for its first eight years, her sympathies are
still with it, so she has handed over for
sale many charming water-color drawings of
her travels to aid the funds of the bush
library. The show was opened at the
League’s rooms by Dr. R. R. Stawell.
Melbourne now boasts a Swiss Consul, M.
Paul Frossard. After directing the inacti-
vities of half a dozen servants in Batavia,
Dutch East Indies, his wife is now learn-
ing the art of flat-keeping in St. Kilda-road.
A P.S. from Adelaide:—
The S.P.C.A. is to benefit by a fgte organised by
Mrs. George Morphett and Mrs. E. M. Luxmoore
at the Morphetts’ home near Glenelg. President S.
J. Jacobs praised the society’s feminine members
-—the secretary has always been a woman; likewise
the majority of the committee —and there were bridge,
tennis, overflowing stalls and gorgeous flowers.
The Butt-Rumfords are booked as the guests of
Professor Richardson and his wife for their first
Sunday here. The friendship dates from the Mel-
bourne days when Mrs. Richardson was a constant
hostess at the Austral Salon.
Mary, daughter of the late W. L. and Mrs.
Reid of Glenelg, has received the usual token from
William Pile, also of Glenelg. She claims kinship with
the Colleys, and he is a member of one of our old
squatting families.
The Barritts hostessed the tea at the first day
of polo practice at Birkalla, and struck one of the
hottest clays we’ve had this summer.
The new carnivora house at the Zoo bears the
name of the late Simpson Newland, one of the
society’s hardest workers and its president for
16 years. The tablet was unveiled by Mrs. Simpson
Newland.
The cable brings news of the death in the Red Sea
of Mrs. George Box, on her way to join her only
daughter, Mrs. James Lewis, in France. The
founder and first sec. of the Queen Adelaide Club,
she made her home on the other side of the world
when she relinquished that position, and returned
here, gravely ill, early last year. One of her chief
interests was the S.P.C.A., and some of the most
successful amateur shows ever staged here were
organised by her on its behalf.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Stony was one of the early fancies for
the Queensland Cup, but he ran so badly in the pre-
liminary w.f.a. races that he was scratched and
sent back to Sydney. He has grown old and cunning.
Consistent Tabragalba and Wee Glen, the Queensland
Derby winner, were first and second favorites, and
they finished in the reverse order, with the well-backed
Ray Rivers third. Wee Glen, though only a little
horse, is a hard puller, but Simmons (formerly
Wynette’s pilot) kept him behind Dusky Singer for
a mile and a half, whereupon the colt established a
lead which he increased to three lengths in the
run down the straight. Tabragalba’s owner pro-
tested on the ground of interference at the three-
furlongs post, but the stewards decided against him.
Wee Glen, who started at s’s, ran the two miles
in the excellent time of 3min. 24sec. By imported
Bernard—Glen Iris, he is a brother to two good
winners, Glenbern and Ardglen.
“Ascot”: Southern owners invaded Queensland in
strong force, but they are returning almost empty-
handed. The teams taken north included sprinters,
stayers, welter horses and a few promising two-
year-olds. The Queensland Cup was regarded as
a gift for Stony; Hit was a certainty for the Bris-
bane Handicap; Miss Garlin would take out the
£lOOO McDougall Stakes for two-year-old fillies;
and other Sydneysiders would sweep up the crumbs
that were left. The operations did not work out
according to plan. On the first day of the meet-
ing the visitors scored two thirds; the second day
was a complete blank. On the third day, The
Wizard, who had won on his previous visit to
Brisbane, scrambled home in the Welter, Guardian
was just nosed out of a two-year-old race, and Her-
mealdo, with a dazzling run, carried off tne last race
of the meeting. Queensland racing form is not
very high, but visiting horses usually take some
time to acclimatise.
* * # *
The A.J.C. continues to get poor fields at
its Warwick Farm meetings; in four of the six
events on Saturday’s programme there were only 23
starters, although one was a £3OO handicap and
two others were £250 affairs. Owners and trainers
complain that the straight is too short, but they
liberally patronise proprietary Moorefield, which has
a shorter straight and gives inferior prize-money.
They will certainly pay for their folly in not help-
ing the premier club to make a success of its new
venture. Backers were on the spot in four of the
six races, which were won by Tom Raigon (6 to 4),
Gulgong (5 to 4), Gloaming’s Sister (7 to 4) ami
Player (5 to 2 on), but the untliougbt-of Rgerton
(Sir Dighton—Marquet) came to the bookmakers’
rescue in the six-furlong splint, for which 33’s was
his nominal price, and John Sands (6’s) was also
a good horse for McShortodds in the mile. Gloam-
ing’s Sister got her race—the Nursery Handicap—on a
protest. Dabble interfering with her at a critical
stage. She was ridden by Jack Toohey, who had
been out of the saddle for many weeks owing to
a bad fall.
* * * •
There was a comparatively small attend-
ance at Caulfield on Saturday, many Melbourne
people having had enough of racing for the time
being. Spearage, a Spearhead gelding in Morrie
McGrath’s stable, was backed to favoritism at 4’s
for the Armadale Cup, 11 furlongs Prestongrange
being at 9 to 2, The Tyrant at (I’s, Tookarby 7’s,
All Sunshine B’s and the others from 12’s to 15’s.
Rawhetu went to the front soon after the start, and
at the mile post w»as five lengths ahead of King of
Mirth, with Valwyne, Valamita, All Sunshine and
The Tyrant handy. About three furlongs from home
Rawhetu dropped back, and King of Mirth, sailing
into the straight with a nice lead, won comfortably
by half a length from All Sunshine, with Tookarby,
who came with a late run. third, and Valwyne
fourth ; time, 2min. 20sec. King of Mirth was vigor-
ously hooted by the crowd. He had scored bril-
liantly in the Hotham Handicap on Derby Day,
starting at outside odds; and then failed badly in
the Veteran Stakes and the Final Handicap, in
w hich he ran last. His party’s explanation that
he is untrustworthy was accepted by the stewards,
and Comedy King stallions —some of them, at any
rate —are certainly inconsistent beggars. Cyden
(fist. 21b.), who had beaten Kanooka in the Mimosa
•Stakes on Oaks Day, was always favorite for the
two-year-old race, starting at f> to 2, and won bril-
liantly by half a length from Switzerland (7’s) and
Cyanate (B’s), who finished very fast; he completed
a double for “Jim” Scobie, who had previously
scored in the Kasouka Hurdle with Juggernaut, a
.25 to 1 shot. Eric Connolly had a success, his
first since his returh from abroad, with Rugbyean
in the Ormond Stakes. The All Black- —Cranbrook
gelding, who showed a bit of form in Sydney early
last season, went out equal favorite at 4’s with
Reputed King, and beat Manaere (B’s) and Bridge-
head (20’s) in very impressive style. He should
win again presently. That good horse Adrift (fist.)
was always favorite (3 to 1 at the finish) for the
llosstown Plate, and though lie had to come round
his field he got there by a neck from Sylosen (B’s),
with Skirling (20’s) in third place. Adrift, who
won the Oakleigh Plate this year, ran the six fur-
longs in lmin. 12jsec. Like Rugbyean, he is trained
by Andy Ferguson.
“Wallaby”: I suspected that Jones was
having a run of bad luck at the races, but he was
not the sort of punter to admit defeat. “Well, how
did you get on?” I would ask him each Sunday
morning over the side fence. And, more often than
not, he would say: “Aw, got out of it! ” and change
the subject. Knowing that his resources were limited,
I simulated surprise when I found he was not “going
out” last Saturday. “Some counter-attraction?” I
asked. “Aw, not to speak of,” Jones replied. “Fact
is, the wife’s been pesterin’ me to take her to some
Baby Health Centre meeting—s’pose a man must
give a thought to the kids now an’ then.” My
neighbor seemed somewhat abstracted when I sighted
him on Sunday morning. “Well, how did you get
on at the meeting?” I asked. “Aw, got out of it!”
said Jones. Then, mercifully, a horse-stinger inter-
vened between me and his confusion.
* * * *
“Old Hand”: Chief Sec. Argyle, who will
have charge of his Government’s Tote Bill in Vic.
Assembly, will try to induce his colleagues to pro-
vide for women being permitted to bet on the
machine, or with Mcßook if they prefer that person.
Tlje Doc. aims, he says, at securing a better machine
than any in the other States. If so, he will arrange
for straightout, place and double-event, implements,
and be content with a deduction of 74 p.c. all told,
or 10 p.c. at the outside.
“Chiron”: The Queensland tote (B. 12/11/’25)
isn’t the greediest machine of its kind in the world ;
it doesn’t even hold the Australian belt. Tasmanian
racing clubs get 10 p.c. and the Government 5 p.c.
of the total turnover; with fractional money and
unpaid dividends deductions average 16j p.c.. State
Attorney-General Ogilvie proposes to license a few
bookmakers. The s.-p. men aren’t exhilarated at
the prospect; one of them —-the biggest operator in
the island —-told me recently that he wasn’t craving
to pay tax on betting-tickets and a larger income,
besides an annual registration fee to each racing
club. But the Tas. Government must do something
to get in more revenue.

“0.H.”: Sammy Cracknell, a famous
jockey of nearly half a century ago, is spending the
evening of his days on an orchard at Panton Hill
(Vic.). Though nearly an octogenarian, Sammy
still takes an interest in racing, and can easily
be enticed into a brisk argument about the respec-
tive merits of Windbag and Pillewinkie or a racy
comparison of Manfred and Grand Flaneur. There
is a Cracknell now riding on Sydney courses, and
there is another in Westralia—or was a year or
two ago. Each has a penchant for avoiding the
rails and trying to win on the outside. Perhaps
they inherit it from Sammy.
JIMMY MUNRO, the Sydney jockey. He
rides Windbag, Boaster and other good ones.
“S. Gumm” : The late W. R. Wilson used
to race a Manfred, and not a bad one either. That
Manfred was a stable-companion of Aurum, the
best horse ever bred at St. Albans and the greatest
three-year-old I ever saw. His third, with Bst. 61b.,
in the 1897 Melbourne Cup was a grand perform-
ance, for he conceded 121 b. to Gaulus and 141 b.
(I think) to Gaulus’s brother, The Grafter. Either
could have won an average Cup with 9st.. ; in point
of fact, The Grafter beat a good field in the follow-
ing year with 9st. 21b. Then he went to England,
and, though a bit past his prime, landed the 1900
City and Suburban, with Bst. 101 b., for Clark and
Brewer, Newhaven (9st.) having won the previous
year for William Cooper. Aurum also went to'
England and showed Mrs. Langtry’s trainer great
trials, but- unfortunately went .wrong, and his stud
career was a failure. Had he been able to race on
English courses, his deeds would have outshone those
of Merman (Cesarewitch, Goodwood Cup and Ascot
Gold Cup), Georgia (Cambridgeshire), Xewhaven, The
Grafter and Australian Star ; at least, that was always
the opinion of the late Allison, of the Sportsman.
The present Manfred is a cut above his predecessor
of that name, but 1 would not place him on a level
with Aurum. Apropos, 1 wonder whether he will be
as good at four years as lie is at three. Other
offspring of Valais have not improved with age.
Heroic was a great disappointment at Randwick in
the autumn and at Flemington in the spring.
Valiard won the Newmarket as a three-year-old, but
cut up badly in his four-year-old engagements. And
there is the ominous case of Lady Valais. She was
a very good filly the day she won the A.J.C. St.
laiger—quite 14lb. better than Frances Tressady—
but in the last two seasons she has persistently
failed in second- and even third-rate company.
Eddie Butcher, the Westralian boy-
Ihgger, who gained the welterweight championship
lO' reason of Harry Collins’s refusal to meet him,
scaled lOat. 4.11 b, and Macari Flores lOst. 3}lb.
when they met before a slim house at the Rush-
cutter Bay Stadium. Flofes, like all of his bread,
depends upon a roaring right to compass his—or,
rather, the other fellow’s—end; and he followed
precedent in leading with that weapon, Butcher
being a left-hander. But Eddie was too clever to
allow the Filipino’s swings to land on a dangerous
spot, and if his busy left had been any use to
him after the seventh round —he “busted” it, in
his own terse language, on Flores’ elbow —he
would almost certainly have knocked the colored
gent. out. As things were, it was a very tired,
pained and sick Filipino that saw, as in a dream,
Joe Wallis place his snowflake hand on Butcher’s
head at the final bell.
Each being as poor a boxer as the other,
the draw decision given after the fight between
American welter-weight Joe Putin and Dave Ross,
at the Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night, was the
only possible one. As a mill it had exciting moments,
but all the scientific boxing in it did not run to
more than a grain or so to the ton. Ross can box,
but he forgot that in meeting the wild onslaughts
of a pug' whose great desire was to land a hefty
right in some place where it would hurt, without
caring particularly where ; and the proceedings were
mostly slogging rushes, varied by clinches which
kept Val Quirk shedding perspiration as he tried
to separate ’em. At the end of the twelfth round
the bruisers went on bruising until they were dragged
apart. Quirk made them shake hands before resum-
ing their discussions.
“F.N.W.”: I disagree with those Bulle-
tin contributors who maintain that 20-round fights
should be prohibited by law. Let us have no pam-
pering of the pug. Until 10 years ago the cham-
pionship course in America was over 45 rounds, and
the aspirant had to argue with Johnson, Langford,
McVea and Moran in the heavyweight department,
and with an equally formidable array in the other
divisions. Johnson lost the title to Willard in the
26th round at Havana in 1910. The punishment
handed out in the ring- has not increased since
those days; in fact, it has considerably diminished
owing to the closer watch kept on performers by
referees and police. While boxers have been killed of
late years in the Australian ring—generally about
the 16th round, as pointed out in The Bum.ktin-
the same thing might have happened in a fiercer bout
of shorter duration. Bruisers have qualified for-
burial inside of three rounds. A fit and healthy
boxer should be able to take anything that comes
to him in a 20-rounder, provided he is reasonably
matched. But some scrappers bring trouble on them-
selves by not bothering to train properly or by
straining to keep inside a weight that they cannot
make and retain their stamina. In England the
20-rounder still rules, and many a biffer who can
walk off “on points” at 15 has to throw in the
towel to the better man over 20.
* * * ' *
Amateur-rider Tt. W. Lamb added to his
laurels at the opening of the track-cycling season
at the Melbourne Motordrome. Tie won a mile handi-
cap from scratch. The nearest competitor in his
heat was on the 60vds. mark, and the limit man
180yds. away; at the start of the final lap Lamb
was last, but, coming with a great sprint, he shot
past the others, to win by a length and a half.
In the three miles scratch race he also proved
superior to all competitors. The young Westralian,
H. K. Smith, had a success in the half-mile.
* * * *
“Lamart”: Walter Harrison. Queensland
Rhodes scholar for 1926,' should make his prpspTieo
felt in track athletics at Oxford. A tall, loose-limbed
native of Ravenswood (N.Q.), he was Queensland
Uni. champion for three successive years. At the
inter-’Varsity contests in June, he won the 440 yards
in 50 2-ssec., and the broad jump with a leap of
22ft. 3in. ; at the subsequent State championships
he was first in the 440 yards, second in the 880,
and first in the broad jump. Harrison, who has just
turned 21, will study law on the other side.
* * * *
“IT. Hardupp”: A bit of extra excitement
was infused into an athletic meeting at Malvern
(Vic.) by the discovery that, there was no steel
tape handy when, as private watches showed, the
20-year-old George Hyde smashed the Vic. record
for two miles. To comply with the rules it was
necessary for the track to be re-measured, and that
before a new day was ushered in. There was a
dashing about in motors, and a Malvern shopkeeper,
knocked up after 11, lent a measure which showed
that Hyde had covered 51yds., 2ft. over the two
miles. His time was 9min. 41sec., and the previous
best (F. W. Page’s) 9min. 44 Lee., so he not only
cut the State record, but must have gone very close
to Australasian figures —G. N. Hill’s 9min. 30 l-ssee.
Hvde finished as fresh as paint, 40 yards ahead
of the second man, after giving his competitors
advantages up to 300 yards.

“Gwy”: The record of the Australian
women’s tennis team in returning with a profit of
nearly £lOOO is a fitting counterpart to its success
on the courts. The result is due to the shrewd
management of the finances by Mrs. Barry, who, in
insisting on a fair share of the “gate” in matches
she arranged personally (some were badly arranged
by other people), showed herself a thorough business
woman. The Australian L.T.A. might do worse
than send the economical lady abroad with future
Davis Cup teams. She would earn her salary.
Witness the disastrous experience of the 1924 team,
which got through nearly £4OOO on its American
trip, and, although reaching the money-spinning
challenge round against Tilden and eo., returned
With a loss instead of a profit. After their first
tour, the girls'have the nucleus of a fund for the
despatch of future teams. And they were a thoroughly
happy family, which men’s teams have not always
been.
* * * *
South Aus., having beaten a weakened
N.S.W. team towards the end of last season, and
finished by defeating England (minus Hobbs and
Sutcliffe), had quite made up its mind to take a
prominent part in the Sheffield Shield matches this
season. It started well by winning the toss against
Victoria at Adelaide last Friday, but the local bats-
men struck an unexpected snag in Blackie, a bowler
who varies his pace and uses his head. Mainly
owing to the St. Kilda veteran—he took 7 wickets
for 71 —the home side were rattled out for the very
moderate total of 171 ; the most attractive display
was a forceful 89 from Rymill, the two Richardsons
being the only others to get into the 20’s. Victoria
didn’t start much more impressively, for three wickets
were down for 51, but Ryder (53), Love (63),
Hendry (34) and Liddicut with a vigorous 62—made
in 68 minutes—retrieved the situation and the
innings closed for 275. Grimmett and Scott, with
5 for 95 and 3 for 104, shared the wickets.
Faced with a deficit
of 105, Gun and
Walsh began steadily,
and were not sepa-
rated till 88 was on
the board. Tne lat-
ter’s contribution was
a patient 24 ; Gun
(67) scored nearly
three times as fast.
Followed some vigor-
ous and even batting,
nearly every man do-
ing his bit. Prit-
chard showed some
hard driving in his 67,
cut short by a bril-
liant catch effected by
Ryder in the slips;
V. Richardson, who
was twice missed,
compiled 36 in a
couple of hours’ stay
at the wickets, and
A. J. Richardson made
some amends for badly
running out Rymill by
putting together 52,
including three sixers
off one over from
Blackie. Wainwright
came along with a
useful 56. and Scott.
Griminett and Ambler,
the wicket-keeper, hit
pluckily towards the
close. Vic. was strug-
gling to get the re-
quired 306 when this
report had to end.
JACK RYDER,
the Vie. all-
rovnder. who has
begun the season
well.
“Wink”: The Victorian selectors are shocking
judges of bowling. Grimmett, passed over by them
for years, won high Test honors in his first season
with South Aus. Now Don Blackie, at 42, with
20 years’ cricket behind him, has become Victoria’s
outstanding trundler. During his 11 seasons with
Prahran he was kept hovering on the verge of an
inter-State career until in 1917 he gave up the
struggle. For five years he dropped out of the
game. Then Cohen, St. Kilda’s captain, worried
him into resurrection, and Don again climbed to the
top of the pennant averages. In his last two
matches with his club he took 6 for 27 and 6 for
37, and his pennant figures this year are 20 for 137.
He is a bowler of the Trumble type—the only one
we have.
“Hamer”: Some remarkable batting profanity was
introduced into the religious calm of Vic. cricket
by Austin, of Ballarat, when the Victorians paused
at the city that used to be golden on their way to
Adelaide. With the usual signs of veneration for
the solemnity of the game, the score had reached
2 for 61 when Austin arrived; 45 minutes later,
when he left, 177 was on the board, the iconoclast
having contributed 102 of the added 116. Three
overs, bowled by Willis brought 58 runs; five fours
ofi successive balls came in one over, and there was
a pair of sixers in each of the others. It is ex-
pected that the V.C.A. will declare Austin “black’'
or something of the sort.
* * * #
Tlie Westralian team now trying its luck
and enlarging its horizon in the east, met a powerful
N.S.W. side, albeit without Bardsley, Kelleway,
Taylor and Oldfield, and not unnaturally fared ill,
although it struggled gamely. The visitors opened
with 194—Grigg got 30 and Evans 38 —after which
the Ma State’s batsmen reaped a bumper harvest of
runs. Rock, the University player, was top scorer
with 151 ; Kippax (118), Macartney (114), Scanes
(94) and Collins (86) were the other principal con-
tributors to the formidable total of 639. The men
from across the continent—five of them are only in
their 'teens, which suggests that youth gets more chance
there than in the Sheffield Shield States—fielded
keenly, though several catches were missed, and
showed no signs of losing heart; their handicap was
a lack of variety in the attack. A fast bowler to
support Inveracity, a promising youngster who can
swerve and break both ways, might have proved an
invaluable asset. In their second innings, batting
without their captain, Harold Rowe, who damaged
a leg while fielding, they put up 211—their highest
score of the tour —Bryant (32) and Rcnfrey (30)
making a plucky stand for the last wicket. Tweed-
dale took four wickets for 36 in W.A.’s first
innings and Everett 5 for 84 in the second.
THE DOOMED FIELDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Vic. Government, which has framed a bill
to legalise the totalizator, is reluctant to treat the
bookmakers with the harshness that the immediate
prohibition of their calling would involve. It is
generally thought that the bill will provide for their
abolition at the end of 10 years or so.”
Brothers, I fear me that our doom is writ;
All w'e may hope for, ere the ring we quit
And bags are high up-hung and voices hushed,
Is for a chance to sock away a bit.
Even the pub that must, delicensed, go
Is giv’n a term to gather in the dough,
A breathing space before the sign comes down;
They can’t be harder upon Ikey Mo.
Ten years, or even five, the fee-uld to lay
Would be appreciable anyway.
Wade in and take the tip some poet gave
To gather blooming rosebuds while ye may.
It comes to queer our pitch at last, the tote,
The danger that so long we held remote,
It comes to fleece the lamb that once was ours,
To pluck the pigeon and to skin the goat.
It comes, a cold machine, to jolt and jerk
The jewelled child of Judah from his lurk,
A cruel matnematical device
To drive the honest penciller to work.
Courage withal, and raise your war-cries higher!
Constrict the odds, and you may still acquire
Before the period of grace is up
Sufficient brass in comfort to retire.

THE INKY WAY.
“Emel”: In the short story in my other weekly
journal this thrilling sentence held my eye: “Hot
blood stunk his face.” Thus does a writer have
originality of expression thrust upon him by a lino-
type that is only one letter wrong.
Back in Australia—he returned as welfare officer
on the Ballarat, which was held up by the strike
in South Africa —is W. Curtis Atkinson, an Austra-
lian journalist who, at the end of the war, ran the
Anzac Bulletin —the official A.I.P. journal published
in London. He was one of the staff of The Daily
Mail when it made its start in Sydney.
“Dux”; The scrapping of H.M.S. New Zealand,
Maoriland’s gift to the Mother Country, recalls the
row that occurred as to which Premier should take
credit for the gift. Ward gave the battleship, but
Massey borrowed the money to pay for it. A
correspondent of the Taranaki Daily News solved
the problem like this: “Place an effigy of Mr. Ward
on the bow, and one on the stern of Mr. Massey.”
That settled it.
Auckland, with its 170,000 population, has been
served by two daily papers, whereas Wellington has
three and Christchurch four. But now a co. has
been formed with £300,000 to launch another daily
in the northern city, and E. C. Huie, managing-
director of the Christchurch Sun, is mentioned as
likely to take hold of the new journal. The co.
is also said to have in its plans the purchase of
the Christchurch Sun for £lOO,OOO or so.
“Country Ped” : At last the word “wowser” has
risen from slang to language. In the Vic. School
Paper for October the word appears (in inverted
commas) in a clipped article by Donald McDonald
on betting, and its signification is explained thus:
“Wowser; one who pretends to be a great deal
better than he really is.” I doubt if that is an
entirely satisfactory definition, but does anyone know
one more suitable to the understanding of children
from 12 to 14?
“Gigadibs” : One of the Inky Way’s recent recruits
is G. V. Rush, “Lochiel” of Melbourne’s new
Morning Post. As a former League footballer and
pennant cricketer, he should be well qualified for
the post of sporting writer. But for an injury he
would certainly have represented the State in the
football field, and he excels not in sport alone. An
M.A., LL.B. and B.Sc. of Melbourne University, he
is known there by the present generation of under-
grads. as a Pure Maths, tutor. He was called to
the Bar in September.
“P.T.”: The Brisbane Digger who stirred Repat.
into action by smashing the Deputy-Commissioner’s
windows was not the first to whom such an idea had
occurred. Over a year ago, after I had been
writing up cases of crippled soldiers who had been
denied pensions, a dying Digger had himself wheeled
up to my office and asked wistfully, “Do you think
it would do the boys any good if I went round and
shot up some of the heads? They can’t do anything
to me, as I’ll be dead next week, anyway.” It
took a lot to convinte him that shooting wasn’t the
best way to reform Repat.
“Taiaha”: Obit, Hamilton Jones, sub-editor of the
Poverty Bay (M.L.) Herald, . after two-score years
and more spent on the Inky Way, without the" loss
of half a day through illness. He practically died
in the harness he had worn so willingly', for only a
few days elapsed between his knocking off work
and his death from a disease of long standing. He
was of that vast army of journalists whose works
usually go unidentified, and many a y'oung pressman
had reason to be grateful for his helpfulness. After
an unsuccessful attempt to establish a morning paper
at Gisborne (M.L,), he put in 20 years on the paper
in whose service he died. He was a brother of
R. N. Jones, M.L. Under-Secretary for Native Affairs.
“P.X.”: A pushful young Australian who is now
well to the front in London newspaperdom is F.
W. Doidge, lately made a director of the Daily
Express —the concern of which Lord Beaverbrook
is the Big Chief. Doidge, a son of the man who
for many years ran the paper at Cootamundra
(N.S.W.), wrote his first pars, there, and towards
the end of the war, being no longer fit for the
trenches, found himself with a small job in the
new Department of Information, which had been set
up under Beaverbrook. There Doidge’s extraordinary
push caught Beaverbrook’s eye—he being that sort
of person himself—so that when the war was over
the young man was quite naturally transferred to
Beaverbrook’s paper, if he didn’t transfer himself.
After a while he became circulation manager; and
at the beginning of this month he took another
stop towards the throne.
“S.T.S.”: The tender conscience of South Aus.
has been the origin of a sporting competition. All
the Adelaide papers started crossword puzzles for
trifling cash prizes, the first correct solution opened
on a given date to he the winner. The police inter-
vened on the ground that the skill required was
not enough to take it out of the lottery class. The
Register then put out a shilling book of 24 puzzles,
and offered £lOO in prizes; each book had to be
finished off with a limerick made out of only the
words found in the puzzles, and the best verse was
to win only if it appeared in a correct book. Thus
some of the best limericks were ruled out for bad
solving, and correct solvers found their poetic style
badly cramped bv the restrictions. The £5O first
prize went to this moderate effort: —
“A Yogi obese of Nepal
Oared for the law not at all;
If e’er he was dunned
By a Pagan rotund.
He hunted the cow with a maul.”
Prize-winners were all over the continent and in
M.L. An Adelaide doctor, a Bulletin contributor,
lodged a half-humorous protest on behalf of his own
efforts; but the judges turned up his book and pro-
duced three or four small errors in solving, and a
verse containing one word, that was not available.
“THE DELEGATE.”

But now I’m here, like Sheba’s Queen of old

Your city is astounding. ’Twill compete
With any in the old land. I’d repeat
That statement, sir, in London. Thingum-street

And few the cities where I have not been.
Your girls? Such charm, intelligence and grace,
Such poise, such bloom—the future of the race
Which claims such mothers is assured. And then
I’m greatly taken with your splendid men,
A virile type, sir; keen, intelligent.
But never has my time been better spent
Than in the study of your railways. Great
Indeed must be such assets to vour State.
Your water conservation has impressed
My mind as easily among the best.
Your bush? A revelation! Sombre? Stuff!
I’m glad that travel calls the poets’ bluff.
In short, I’m charmed, delighted. Very soon

I USED to think that one motor spirit was as good as
another and that the brand didn’t matter. I used to
wonder at the enthusiasm of my motoring friends on
the subject of PLUME.
“ ‘Those days have gone for ever.’ Good motoring
is absolutely tied up with good motor spirit. I drive the
same car but I am actually driving a better car now that
I use PLUME.
It’s the volatility of Plume that’s the Secret
“Plume makes my engine more responsive. It gives
me every ounce of power. It gives me extra mileage.
“My friend, do as I did. Put Plume to the test.
Let the performance of your car be your guide. It will
be a revelation to you, as it was to me —and you will
become another Plume enthusiast.”

That curious mixture, the Sydney Reper-
tory Society, staged “Getting Married” on
Saturday night at the Palace with at least
three pros, in the cast —Beatrice Day, Gre-
gan McMahon and Gerald Kay Souper. This
is the Shaw play in which, though action is
discussed and violently debated, there is little
or none of it. It is a drama dialogued in
witticisms, and the people taking part are
the relations assembled for the wedding of
the Bishop’s youngest daughter, Edith.
Everybody is sitting about a long table wait-
ing for the bride, when news is brought that
she has shut herself up to read a pamphlet
concerning the responsibilities o.f the wife in
matrimony, and she’s not sure she’ll go
through with it. A similar message arrives
from the bridegroom, Frederick Hughes.
Then the dogs of talk are unleashed, and
the holy estate is worried to shreds by bishop,
general, spinster, maid, near-divorcee and
greengrocer.
* * * *
To Beatrice McDonald as the bride who
wouldn’t be bridled the bulk of the
honors go. She looked tingling with
life, and her voice never missed or slurred
a point. Daphne Deane and Ethel
Lewis, on the other hand, though looking
attractive, were not equal to their parts
vocally ; the voice of each struck the ear in
a curiously deflated tone. Gregan McMahon’s
general was stagey. Beatrice Day as the
Bishop’s wife brought to her lines the suave
charm and the mellow cadences her admirers
have learned to expect; and cheers go to
THE SYDNEY REPERTORY THEATRE

Gregan McMahon as

Harold Watch, the philosophical greengrocer,
for his diverting work; to Gerald Kay Sou-
per, as the diverting Reggie; to Erna Living,
the lady who combined the jobs of mayoress
and clairvoyant. A praiseworthy show,
though sometimes the performers rather gave
the effect of fumbling after the meaning of
the madcap author they were interpreting.

“The Great Lover,” as Maurice Mosco-
vitcli sees him, will move from Sydney Cri-
terion to the Theatre Royal (vacated by
G. B. Post’s “Bad Man”) on Saturday night
for a final week of romantic amorousness^
•I* V
Herschel Henlere was never so absorbingly
entertaining as he has been this last week.
Discarding a lot of bis usual side-play,
he treats his Sydney Tivoli audience to a
feast of delightful piano-iplaying, and it
is universally hoped that he will book his
passage back to these parts. Walter Nilsson,
a trick cyclist who enjoys the patronage of
the angel that protects drunks, pedals
merrily on an assortment of wheels ranging
from a wooden disc to a Scandinavian egg-
beater. And the Palais Royal dancing cham-
pions are moving with an intent precise-
ness which indicates that modern dancing is
too serious a matter to jest abowt.
Keith Wilbur’s imitation of a black orping-
ton (gent.) welcoming the dawn at Sydney
Fullers’ is so natural that one can only
assume he has been reared from childhood
on cracked corn. But his greatest feat is
the mimicry of a five-piece jazz-band. The
Musicians’ Union’s opinion of this attack on
the one-man-half-a-job principle would blis-
ter an ice-cream. Gayle Wyer’s new revue
is better, the Three Melfords show how the
same number of pawnbrokers would dance
the sailor’s hornpipe, and Victor Burke’s
baritone solos hover around the fair.
H: * %
“Owd Bob,” billeted at Sydney Picca-
dilly, gives attractive glimpses of the charm
of England’s north country. The actors act
without acting, and, as in most English films,
there is an atmosphere of sincerity about it.
It is the week’s best picture. With a false
beard and flowing robes, Theodore Roberts
still strides majestically at Hoyt’s, where
“The Ten Commandments” is shown.
Irreverent patrons declare that Theodore
would do better if he had his usual cigar
to chew.
* * # *
A late Spring offering:—
Thea Proctor and Margaret Paeston in their
exhibit at the Grosvenor Galleries, Sydney, show
similar tendencies. The last-named lady’s vases
are too flat to harbor water, and the drop of dew
that could cling to the petals of her flowers would
be a capable athlete. The artist, in whose pictures
this critic used to find considerable surcease from
care, does not nowadays seem able to make up her
mind whether she is aiming at flat design or work-
ing in three dimensions, and her perturbation com-
municates itself to the spectator. No. 46, “Nude
with Dog,” has feeling, but most of the still-lifes
are agitated muddles of hard blacks and far too
many colors. The a Proctor also draws a flat world
in accordance with the ancients, and after quaffing
a full measure of delight from her keen pencil line
one stifles a desire to turn the figures round t.o see
if they have backs to them. In her color wood-
prints, however, manner and medium are satisfac-
torily wedded. No. 41, “The Swing,” is delight-
fully humorous. There is delicacy as well as broad
design in the girl sitting in reverie by a window
in No. 32, but in her pencil studies dexterity in
details fails often to conceal general faulty drawing.
If the Spanish girl in No. 30, for instance, straight-
ened her elegant arm, she could almost touch the
floor without bending her distinguished knee-joints.
jJj SjC }J>
Despite her growing bad habit of skating
from one word to another, Nellie Bramley
made a success of her first appearance in the
name-part of “Madame X” which, for the
second time within about a year, was given an
airing at Melbourne King’s ion Saturday.
Altogether the tearful production was up to
standard. Miss Bramley only followed an
established lead and the book in making the
earlier situations impossible; but her emo-
tion in the court scene was convincing. Carl
Lawson’s build is so mature that the audi-
ence tittered when he announced his age
as 32 ; otherwise he gave a reasonable repre-
sentation of Louis Floriot. Guy Hastings
handled the part of the adventurer Laroque
well. Like most criminals who become re-
formed characters, Austin Milroy, somewhat
strangely cast as Noel, was preachy, but
his dogmatic assertion of the right of a
strayed wife to her husband’s forgiveness,
when she has decided that straying doesn’t
pay, gained its due meed of applause—
mostly feminine. Better expositions of
Perrisard and Merivel have been seen than
those of Arthur Cornell and John Galway;
but George Hewlett was a likeable Raymond
Floriot, whose love for the dainty Helene
of Beryl Barraclough called for no apology.
The Dickens impersonator Clement May ob-
served a judicial air as the president of the
court in which the big voice of George
Bryant boomed as usual as the public prose-
cutor. Unless popular approval makes an
unanticipated demand for an extension, ten
nights will see the end of the revival.
On Monday “The Street Singer” moved on
to her new stand at His Majesty’s, Melbourne,
which “Wildflower” vacated on Saturday.
The musical lady continues to bestow her
love on a stiff artist to the approval of
large audiences.
* * * *
“The Farmer’s Wife” will commence next
Saturday at Melbourne Royal to serve out
what, according to the management, is the
clotted cream of theatrical entertainment.
$ # if
“Archie,” at the New Princess (Melb.),
still amuses large audiences by a juggle be-
tween wliite nightgown and pink pyjamas,
sundry catchy melodies and a hash of jokes,
some of them old. Nobody has many
troubles at the Spring-street theatre; the
management has least of any.
“LEAVE IT TO JANE." AT SYDNEY
MAJESTY'S.
Maud Fane, an athletic flirt, acts as a decoy-
duck for Sophomores.
At Melbourne’s New Palace “Are You a
Mason?” is to tickle the populace until
November 25, after which, it is understood,
Sydney is to be given a chance to do the
laughing.
A lesson in the futility of communistic
idealism is written in laughter at the
Athenaeum Theatre (Melb.), where Harry
Green and Roy Rene—-the latter showing a
vast improvement —still expound “Give and
Take.”

Hoyt’s Melbourne house is in a sort of
way prolonging the Cup season with “The
Kings of the Turf”—a picture which intro-
duces, amongst other famous horses, Man-
o’-War. The speedy film has good support
from “The. Man in Blue.” Comedy, with

The popularity of the Royal Squadron
Syncopators has grown at Melbourne Tivoli
until audiences have got the habit of de-
manding as much work of its obliging mem-
bers as they do of Maurice Diamond’s
dancing girls. The show has been further
brightened by the arrival of Jennie Benson,
a slick and capable comedian. And now the
management is whispering excitedly that
Ella Shields is coming, and a £5O prize
is offered for a real Australian song for
her to sing.

Willie Lancet is back in Melbourne Bijou
and in the graces of its audiences. If lie
in any way falls short of the artistry of
Georgie Wood, the fact that he looks less
grown-up is something to the good. There
is a regrettable family resemblance between
“Willie Comes Home,” the sketch he has
been staging this week, and one used by the
other midget; but it is well done, with good
assistance from Edward Avon and Lilas
Birt. Amongst the others on the bill Nellie
Ivolle is as popular as ever.
Miss Pauline Gallagher, prize-winner at
the Ballarat competitions this year, exhibited
a voice of fine quality and excellent poise at
the Melbourne Auditorium one day last
week, opening with “Ah Fors e Lui,” with
which she scored her greatest success. She
did quite brilliantly in spite of some lack of
polish; and the florid work in Proch’s
“Theme and Variations” was well done also.
It is a pity that a larger audience was not
present to enjoy an excellent concert, in the
success of which St. Patrick’s Cathedral
choir and tenor George Bryer shared.

Cesar Franck’s “Symphony in D Minor”
was the item of chief interest at the last
concert of the Melbourne University Sym-
phony Orchestra. Although the wood wind-
instruments had a somewhat rough passage,
the orchestra secured an admirable success,
with special praise due to Dr. F. Rudall
on t}ie English horn. Another item of
distinction was the virile work of Edward
Goll in Saint Saens’s piano concerto in L
Minor.

Some Art Exhibits in Melbourne:—
Of the 26 exhibitors at the show of the Society
of Etcher-Painters at the New Gallery six arc
English, but the work of the Australians Sydney
Ure Smith, John Shirlow, Syd. Long and A. H.
Full wood ■ has most distinction. Shirlow’s stands
out particularly—it has a fine mellowness; “The
Central Station” (No. 7) and an aquatint, “Nightfall’
t*>o. 12), are particularly good offerings. An
impressive “The Passing Storm” (No. 88) and The
Camp in the Forest” (No. 83) bring out the poetical
qualities of Long's work. Fullwood’s dozen are
good but stilted. Ure Smith’s most delightful
effect is in “Washing Day” (No. 110) and “Farm
Sheds” (No. 114) ; he has less success with his
distances in “Office of the S. M. Herald” (No. 119),
although the towering new building offers a fine
contrast with the still undestroyed old building in
the foreground. E. Warner succeeeds best with
“Martin’s Farm” (No. 50), and there is delicacy in
T. Friedensen’s “Lacey’s Creek” (No. 1) and vigor
in “The Breaking Up of H.M.A.S. Australia” (No.
2) ; but there is stiffness and unreality in Bruce
Robertson’s treatment of trees and foliage that spoils
his efforts. J. Barclay Godson (M.L.) occupies
himself mainly with scenes about Sydney’, well
drawn, “Minnamurra Reflections” (No. 75) being
the most appealing of his dozen ; and John C. Good-
child, the solitary South Aus. exhibitor, succeeds
best on foreign soil with “The Heart of Sy’dney”
(No. 132). There is a good deal of the common-
place in the offerings of the other Australians; and
the work of the English exhibitors (including an
exquisite “Azaleas,” by Anna Airey’), though it
shows fine enough craftsmanship, strikes this critic
as too photographic.
Miss H. Pawsey, showing 76 oils at the Athen-
aeum Gallery, sends an amateur talent singing into
blue skies, and others that are grey, and is so
occupied w’ith this that she frequently makes the
dull earth beneath more dull, and certainly less
convincing, than it should be. There is sincerity
in the work, but not sufficient knowledge. The best
of the collection are “Gorse, Wattle Park” (No. 57),
“The Seasons, Fitzroy Gardens,” and “My Garden”
(No. 20).
The wonderful advance made in poster work is
illustrated by an exhibition at Melbourne’s latest
gallery, the Education Department’s art centre, in
what used to be Melbourne Gaol, from which the
ghosts of old crimes and criminals have been evicted.
Royal Academicians have no reluctance to share in
this sort of work nowadays, and the broad effects
of Sir D. Y. Cameron and Frank Brangwyn mix in
with the contributions of Newbould, Taylor, Dowd,
Lamorna Birch, Cecil Aldyn and others. It is all
striking, covering the railway posters of the United
Kingdom, Holland, Belgium and Italy.

Muriel Starr ended an eventful season at
Adelaide Royal with the rather gloomy
mother-love play, “The Pelican.” She seems
to be more effective than ever before. The

chance; also Sidney Stirling and Atholwood
as “the Spider” and Jaikes. But the pick
of the season was “Secrets” —thrilling, quite
unusual and funny as well. The plucky
opera season at the Prince of Wales ended
with “Faust,” in which Filippini takes the
minor part of Valentine, and “Rigoletto,
which is perhaps his best part. In pictures
Valentino at West’s shows the French court
in “Beaucaire” in a way the stage never
could do. The York has the powerful and
no doubt costly Ibanez drama “Enemies
of Women” ; also a pleasant screen version
of “Aren’t We All?” Wondergraph relies
mainly on sob-stuff, “The Mansion of Ach-
ing Hearts.” Clara Butt is just coming in at
the Town Hall and Lee White at the Royal.

Westinghouse
Light and Power Plants
will bring you all the
advantages of electricity
Whether you live on farm or station, you can make it a better place
to live with electricity. Electricity provides the same comforts and
conveniences enjoyed in the city. It makes work easy and gives you
more leisure and freedom. It gives you light cheaply and power
cheaply,
Ask yourself these questions: Do I want electricity? The answer
must be yes. What do I want most from a lighting plant? Simplicity,
so that it won’t go wrong; dependability, quietness, cleanliness and
safety, so that I won’t have any worry. Those are the features of
Westinghouse plants, made by a company which is the largest
manufacturer of electrical appliances in the world, having an employee
list of 44,000; and you might be sure that the Lighting Plant they
manufacture embodies all the latest improvements known to electrical
science, and will in every way maintain the high standard of efficiency
which the name “Westinghouse” implies.
Can you afford it? You can afford to run it because it is as cheap as kerosene. You can
afford to buy it because our terms system is absurdly easy. Just think what it will give you.
Lighting first, then power—for sawing, pumping, milking, separating, grinding, sweeping,
washing, ironing and the sewing-machine, as well as many other tasks. It can give you the means
of combating fire and of having running water by providing power for an automatic pressure
water system. It will provide power for electric fans and also run the Kelvinator. You cannot
help wanting it, and it’s all so easy to obtain Have you investigated the wonderful guarantees
given with the installation of a “WESTINGHOUSE” LIGHT and POWER PLANT?
Tell us the sort of work you could use a plant for, and we will tell you the type, size arid price
of the plant you need, as well as how you can pay for it while you use it. Write for the Westing-
house book—it will interest you, and does not obligate you in any way.

“W.E.W.”: Quirindi (N.SAV.) has de-
cided to hold an Australian concert on
January 26 —only Australian songs and
music. Now, what would be a suitable pro-
gramme? Grainger, I suppose, we are en-
titled to draw upon, and George in. Clutsam,
who is a native of Sydney. What would you
include if you were drawing up an all-Aus-
tralian programme?
“Caul-boy” : Australia’s amusers are mak-
ing active preparations for next year’s offen-
sive. The latest volunteer, under recruiting-
sergeant Gravestock, is William Backhaus,
an indefatigable pianist who accompanied
Melba on an extended tour of America,
Europe and the Cold Country with marked
success some years ago. Backhaus is 41,
and chose Germany for his birthplace, but
crossed to England in 1905 to prof, at the
Royal College of Music, Manchester. Pos-
sessed of two fists of amazing dexterity, he
should show audiences some musical fire-
works, at any rate.
“Mosey”: Australia has seen plenty of
Jewish actors, and by a strange coincidence
the four mummers caricatured on the Sundry
Shows page of November 5 are all Hebrew.
The most cultured of the quartette is
Maurice Moscovitch. His son, known
as Nat Madison, already a capable
comedian, should under his artistic father’s
guidance himself become a star. Harry
Green and Roy Rene are in a different cate-
gory. Their special line is farcical-comedy,
though the first-named has a gift for senti-
ment and is invariably interesting. Roy
Rene, inventor of the vaudeville “Mo,” seems
likely to be “Mo” or “Mo’s” brother to the
end of his days. One must admit, however,
that he makes the weird Yid a screaming
figure of fun. The difference between Mos-
covitch and “Mo” seems to be that, whereas
the former has studied the art of acting and
doesn’t act, the latter has not studied the
art of acting and over-acts.
“Hamfat” : “A Night Out,” which opened
the volume of Bob Greig’s theatrical history in
America, got no further than Philadelphia,
where it closed down in two weeks. The
music, which is by Youmans, the “No, No,
Nanette” composer, was praised by the
critics, but the “book” was unmercifully
slated. Bob Greig and Toots Pounds, the
only Australians in the cast, got the best
notices —the only really good ones, in fact —
and Lee Shubert gave both of them better
engagements for “The Student Princess,”
which has been a great success Toots
Pounds to go to California, and Greig to
remain on the eastern circuit, with a chance
of opening the play in London. That was a
stroke of good fortune; but the members of
“A Night Out” company, although guaran-
teed eight weeks’ salary, were paid for three
weeks only.
“Ancient Prompter”: Eden Pliillpott’s
Devonshire comedy “The Farmer’s Wife,”
just due in Melbourne, calls for a long cast.
The majority of the mummers have been
brought from England, but three well-known
local players get a look-in —Mary McGregor,
Maurice Dudley and Eardley Turner.
“M.G.S.”: A quite inordinate amount
of publicity is given to the wrong people in
this world. Every little minx with a slender
talent for warbling or throwing her pretty
legs about upon the stage is sure to have
gallons of ink spilt on her behalf.
No detail about her attractive char-
acter or her domestic felicities is too banal
for publication in the press or the theatre
programmes; the faithful freelance stands
ready to polish the halo of any knock-
about comedian. Since nine-tenths of the
histrionic band are merely purveyors of
other people’s wit, there is no reason why
they should not be anonymous, like an
engine-driver or a process engraver. Or, to
put it the other way about, there is no
reason, since actors and actresses get all
this limelight, why architects should not
sign their buildings, bricklayers their tuck-
pointing and plumbers their often highly
elegant plumbing.
“FAY.” : Australia’s latest contribution to
Broadway is Margot Lester, daughter of
Adelaide Hemingway and the late Edwin
Lester. This young lady, with all the bloom
of Melbourne adolescence still upon her, is
appearing in “Ilay Fever” at the Maxine
Elliott Theatre, and the critics are saying
kind things about her distinctive appearance
and histrionic future. The other two ladies
in the cast are Laura Hope Crews and Freda
Innescourt, so Margot is in good company.
The play is by Noel Coward, the English
actor-playwright, who is also responsible
for “The Vortex,” at present the most-talked-
of and best-acted play in New York.
“Minim”: Hayden Coffin, the original
singer of the “Dorothy” ballad “Queen of
My Heart,” is still on deck. The veteran
baritone was in the London Coliseum bill
recently and sang the old song as well as
ever he did, its reception by the audience
being enthusiastic. Another item of liis turn
was “Jack’s the Boy,” from “A Country
Girl,” in which he first appeared in 1902.
Coffin, now in his G4th year, has,never visited
Australia, but one of our enterprising man-
agers is sure to import him somwhere about
1930.
“Sutton V.”: To “Caesar’s Ghost” (B.
5/11/’25) Ibsen’s plays “seem prim in these
times.” I find little “primness” in “Beer
Gynt.” Certainly the Peer-Ingrid episode
on the hill while the bridegroom is waiting
at the church does not suggest Dorcas
societies or the home life of the late Queen.
Neither does “Ghosts,” of which a provin-
cial co. gave a performance at Warminster,
close to the Sutton Yeny camp, in 1917. It
made even hardened Diggers move uneasily
in their seats and mutter that it was “crim-
son hot.”
“Gregor”: Among the numerous dramas
unaccepted by Australian theatrical man-
agers is a seven-act play entitled “The Cause
of Kelly,” by Robitt Jon Clow, of Gooran-
goola. Written in blank verse, it depicts
the Kellys as injured martyrs possessing
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
"You know, old. man, when editors publish
the rubbish they do, I can’t understand
them rejecting your stories."
every possible virtue, and the police as fiends
in human guise. A foreword by the author
points out that Australia is somewhat handi-
capped by the lack of legendary heroes from
whose deeds inspiration may be drawn, and
offers the Kellys in this capacity. There
are nearly 40 characters in the play, amongst
the minor ones being J. F. Archibald, George
Coppin, Redmond Barry and Gauuson. I
have seen a handsome limp-leather pocket
edition of this amazing work. In the event
of a stage production some censoring would
be necessary, for the dialogue is largely
couched in the language of rough men moved
by powerful emotions.
“Ibsenshaw”: The best dramatisation of
Dickens’s “Tale of Two Cities” (B.
12/11/"25) was not Tom Taylor’s. It was,
curiously enough, the work of a clergyman,
the Rev. Freeman Wills, brother of the
better-known W. G. Wills, and was
called “ The Only Way.” It is still,
after 20 years or more, in the repertoire of
Martin Harvey, the English star. He never
did better or more effective work than in the
character of Sydney Carton, and the chances
are he never will.
“Forebridge”: The curtain-speech, with-
out which few leading Amercan actors find
it possible to conclude a performance, is a
habit which does not appeal to Australian
audiences. If the play is a good one, and a
full house has been aroused to enthusiasm,
IN NO HURRY.
“What, you offer me ten bob for a master-
piece like that! Thank God I'm not
dying of starvation yet!"
“Very well, I’ll vait.”
a few words of thanks, spoken in a voice
suitably over-charged with gratitude and
emotion, may do no harm. But after a
matinde, when a poor play has been pre-
sented to an apathetic audience in a half-
empty theatre, a curtain-speech is an inflic-
tion. Guy Bates Post, having struggled
through “The Bad Man” on a recent Satur-
day afternoon, stepped in front of the curtain
and insisted on thanking the handful of bored
and hungry playgoers for their encourage-
ment and support. “I s’pose lie’s narked, but
he needn’t be so sarcastic,” was the shrill
comment of a flapper in the stalls.
“Lysander” : Melbourne has a jazz-percus-
sionist who excites no angry feelings. Start-
ing with a passion for the toy drum when
he was four, he has been encouraged by
proud parents to develop his dreadful “art,”
and now at 11 years he handles his kit of
noise-foundries with all the assurance of
a hardened Yankee offender. His name is
Athol Smith, though he answers more readily
at Wesley College to the call of “Winkie”
or “Winks.” He owns a full jazz-set of booms
and clangs, bells and pop-pops, rumbles and
fizzes, and times his intrusions into orches-
tral melody largely by watching Dad, who
plays the piano.
“Namoi” • “Loco’s” tribute to the value
of Wirtlis’ elephants in railway operations
reminds me. A couple of years
ago, when the circus was touring
the North, it struck a hostile crowd
at Townsville. A rowdy section
declared the prices too hot, and a
mob of hooligans took possession of
the ticket-office (one of the wag-
gons) and began to run it down
towards an adjacent waterhole.
The police vrere hurriedly sent for,
but the manager didn’t delay action
while they were coming. A couple
of performing elephants were
brought out and steadied the wag-
gon—and the crowd—in a few
moments. A regiment of blue-coated baton-
wielders couldn’t have been more effective.
A “Pinafore” memory :
The understudy, a little brunette who had
had but a few months’ experience with the Royal
Comics, reported at the stage-door of His Majesty’s
Theatre at 7.30 p.m., and, finding that all was
well with the lady who claimed her particular
interest, informed the doorkeeper that her address
for the next two hours would be the Criterion.
About 9 p.m. a messenger found her enjoying the
show. “You are wanted immediately,” he said.
Arrived at His Majesty’s in the interval after
the first act, she saw the stage-manager, who was
frantic with anxiety. “Miss Topsquall,” he explained,
“has strained one of her vocal cords and couldn’t
finish the first act. You’ll have to go on. Do
you know the part?” “Yes,” returned the under-
study. “How long will you give ine?” “Twenty
minutes,” replied the s.-m. “Go and get my aunt
at the Criterion,” said the little brunette to the
messenger; “I told her I'd be only 10 minutes
away.” The prima donna, still in her first-act dress,
was receiving attention and sympathy in her dressing-
room, most of which she occupied, being a massive
dame, but the understudy managed to make-up
with someone’s greasepaint and, literally sewn into
the dress worn by Josephine in the second act, rushed
down the stairs. She entered as the orchestra played
the introductory chords to “The Hours Creep on
Apace,” and the song was twice encored. Present!}
aunt, who had been duly collected from the Criterion,
entered the dress-circle and spotted her niece on
the stage. “My gracious!” said the dear old lady.
“These theatricals arc exciting people. We could
never do that in Wagga.”
“Topee”: Talking to an English comedian
in Sydney, I noticed that his speech was
sprinkled with the American slang one meets
with in moving-picture sub-titles and stage
yarns in the Saturday Evening Post. Not
a trace of the argot familiar in the mouths
of mummers 50 years ago. In those days
English pros, larded their conversation with
terms like “quisby” and “pross,” now obso-
lete. The first was the superlative used
when deploring the state of business, the
degrees being “rnulty” (doubtful), “perni-
cious multy” (decidedly rotten) and “quis-
by” (hopeless). To “pross” meant to cadge
from, as in the broken actor's lament: —
No one to love me,
Nowhere to doss ;
Can’t get an order,
No one to pross.
Nowadays it is all “wow,” “jake,” “fierce"
and “apple sauce.”
“0. Ockney” : It was Israel Zangwill who,
discussing the Americanising of the British
stage, remarked: “The United States send
us their stars and tripe.” But Izzy himself
was instrumental some years ago in fetching
several American stars and a play of sorts
to London. The piece was his own “Child-
ren of the Ghetto,” which, under the late
Charles Frohman’s direction, had scored a
hit in New York. The entire production was
taken from Broadway to the Adelphi. where
it was such a failure that it was withdrawn
inside a fortnight and shipped, lock, stock
and barrel, back again across the Atlantic.
Zangwill’s wheeze on that occasion was:
“It’s a case of small profits and quick
returns.”
“F.N.W.”: I had occasion to look up a
performer at a Newtown (N.S.W.) music-
hall. While trying to locate the stage-door
in the gloom of the usual back-street, I
stumbled on a free show which was obviously
appreciated by the Lads of the Village, who
were hanging around in noticeable numbers.
Through the chinks of a door issued sub-
dued chunks of harmony dispensed by the
theatre band. Suddenly the door opened,
and a pair of nymphs, in well-filled tights,
sprinted across the road and vanished into
another hole in the surroundings. At short
intervals the blithesome parade continued,
encouraged by such remarks as “Mind the
puddle, Maggie,” while a particularly popular
Bathing Beauty was navigating the crossing.
Lack of space in the theatre proper com-
pelled the management to construct dressing-
rooms on the opposite side of the street.
Hence the free eyeful for the grateful New-
town knut.
“Flaming Youth” : The return, after long
absence, of a mummer whose love affairs
were once notorious was followed by a scene
in his hotel. An angry woman appeared,
and, claiming to be his lawful partner, de-
nounced him as a soulless wife-deserter.
Summoning his best dramatic style, Spouter
faced the situation bravely. “How dare you
make such charges!” he boomed. “They are
an insult to my deah wife —the lady whose
hand I am holding!” His accuser only be-
came more furious. “Do you deny that
you married me?” she shrieked, flashing a
crimped paper in his face. Spouter looked
at it a moment before drawing himself up
proudly. “I do not deny it!” he declaimed.
“But, good heavens, that was five years
ago!”
“Lond” : C. B. Cochrane produced “Jolly
Jack Tar” in 1918, immediately after the
Armistice. Seymour Hicks was part author,
and it was an odd mixture of melodrama, re-
vue and moving picture. In one scene a naval
captain was praying for guidance in his cabin
before battle, and a vision of Nelson appeared
to him. But the mirror by which the effect
was obtained was not always placed at the
proper angle; and one night there were roars
of laughter because a couple of stagehands,
eating bread and cheese and drinking beer,
showed alongside Nelson. “I lost several
thousand pounds over the venture,” Cochrane
sadly concludes.
“Lysander” : There is a new craze for prefix-
ing “Mr.” and “Miss” to the names of actors
and actresses on programmes and the like.
A movie or melodrama cast now reads like
the report of a mayoral garden party. I
suppose members of the profesh. are as
deserving of the prefix as “gentlemen” crick-
eters, horse-owners and union secretaries,
but the “Miss” is absurd. when a buxom
matron is thus designated, and the “Mr.”
evokes jeers when it is conferred on some
dummy clown who is known as Bill Smig-
gitts in Collingwood or Balmain.
A MATTER OP BUSINESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Of all masculine modes taken by modern women,
plus-fours doubtless will prove the most sightly
and sensible, for they have a fulness which conceals
defects. Most artists since the ancient Greeks agree
that whatever may be thought of the beauty of
woman’s form generally, her legs are usually less
shapely than those of men.”— Daily Chronicle.
The theatre is hushed. The baton-tip
Taps its insistent message to the violins;
A whisper rustling soft from lip to lip,
A blaze, a blare —the latest music-show begins.
The weary business man now wins
Two full hours’ deep forgetting of commercial sins.
See how he forward leans in cushioned seat
To miss no ripple of beauty in the tide that swims
From farther darkness of the wings, to beat
In foam of filmy drapery and shimmering limbs
About the footlights, while he hymns
The goddess Jazz —her sacred, syncopated whims.
But now a horror on him swiftly pours!
He goggles wild, as those who frightful phantoms
see.
Behold, each shapely leg in full plus-fours,
And hidden every trace of dainty nudity!
No longer twinkling pink and free,
But quite voluminously draped each dimpled knee !
Arises then that worthy man in wrath.
Fruitless the ushers’ whispered efforts to explain.
Women and men he brushes from his path
And loud and long demands his money back again.
And e’en the manager in vain
Attempts to soothe and still his most indignant
# pain.
Poor art it were, they tell him, to reveal
The ugliness of Chloe’s legs to cultured eyes ;
Such defects must the artist’s blood congeal,
Or even send him shrieking madly to the skies.
“But I’m a business man,” he cries,
“Who needs must see all defects as he buys.”

Getting
The Most
From Your
Power Plant
Economical distribution of the power generated is a big
factor with any production plant.
The line shaft is the distributor, so why unduly load the shaft
by excessive weight of the pulleys?
SKF
SPLIT BELT PULLEYS
relieve the shaft of weight-carrying strains. because of their extreme
lightness, yet such is their strength (because of unique construction) that
heavy loads can be carried at high speeds with absolute safety.
SKF Split Pulleys also effect distinct savings in and tear on belts,
machines and bearings.

yiEING with the rainbow in the
array of beautiful shades it presents
Bond’s “Sylk'Arto” Hosiery is indeed
the joy of the summer girl.
Here is Hosiery matchless in lustre,
proven to possess a capacity for wear
unexcelled by any stocking at any
price, that offers any shade required
to add the final note of colour harmony
to her summer frocking.
Not only is the range of Shades so
extensive as to allow free rein for individual taste
but, almost overnight, the newest tone that
fashion demands is available.
Added to the many attractions of “Sylk~A>rio” is

Buu a Tailor
-made Pipe'/
Many folk marvel at the beautiful
workmanship of the “BBB” Pipe, and
the exquisite fit of vulcanite mouth-
piece to Bruyere stem. This is because
it is “Tailor-made”—each separate
mouthpiece—made from the finest of
fine quality vulcanised Para Rubber —is
shaped and fitted to each individual pipe.
Such care as this in the making of a
pipe is unusual. But then, of course,
the wonderful aged and matured
Bruyere we use for making “BBB”
Pipes is worthy of all the care that
60 years’ experience could conceive.

D. Roverty: Too thin for its length....
H.R.M.: “Cupid" good enough if you could oil the
poor tiling’s joints. It is so mechanical.... Eadie:
“Thought” just misses the mark... .A.S.G.: There
is more music in a bullock’s horn... . J..J.D.: One
good; no feeling in the others—just exercises in
verse nicely done. .. .Will V.: You’ve beaten out your
“Debtor” too thin. . . .E.R.S.: Not much of a yarn
there; it is well enough written.... Ex-E.: That
writer is shocked to hear that he is suspected of
sneering. He thought he was rejoicing... .F.E.R.:
Good; but we’ve had as much as we can stand on
that subject. .. .Whatsit: Dull as a March morning
in Labrador. Or if a March evening is duller, it’s
as dull as that.... Constant Reader: Case referred to
came on appeal to N.S.W. Full Court May 16, 1890,
and on August 5 following leave was granted to
appeal to Privy Council.... Alma B.: Frankly, it
doesn’t even resemble verse.... Harry J.: It hovered
between print and the basket, but finally took the
wrong turning... .H.M.W.: Off the target....
F.G.H.: Ditto; but yours doesn't miss by much....
S.F.C.: Not for us; and a few of the lines may pos-
sibly make it not for anybody.... Ande: Very ragged
. ...N.W.: “Retrospect” and “Evening” are not
fresh enough. .. .E.M.: There is a picture in this
stanza that we never met before:—
The earth is clothed with garments sheen,
The spirits life is ever seen;
The glory of the trees in spring,
The blossom’s perfume pleasures bring;
The autumn’s gifts—fruits, wine and lees—
Make day-man dance as on the sprees.
With bending limbs Trees bow the crown
Of luscious fruit near to the ground.
. ...G.M.H.: Don’t like parodies and this is too
long and tedious. Also it goes out of scansion at
the fourth line... .M.H.H.: The picture is vivid
enough as far as it goes, but the thing is too thin.
... .S.B. (Bankstown) : Terrific verse. .. .Iv.S.A.:
They haven’t enough interest... .K.J.8.: Not badly
done, except for one false rhyme; but the verse
says nothing. .. .E.G.M.S.: Sounds like the remark
of a tired Plymouth Sister anxious about the soul
of a deaf charwoman... .Paul R.: Rather dreary....
Percy: They are not exactly bad, but they are thin
and the point is not sharp.... John S.: Doesn’t get
near... .C.J.A.: A poor story of a poor kind
Double Bee: The yarn is not well told and only-
good telling could have made it do. Writing, like
everything else, is a matter of taking pains....
Ripponlea: With all its clear vision it has the deli-
cate simplicity of its subject :-
“Come, tell me, my friend,” said Spielvogel, “How
Do you fancy it in the mouth of a cow?”
Large platters of molars on the table lay,
At another this dentist was working away.
“An improvement, I doubt not,” I guarded replied,
“But won’t you endanger the countryside?
Jeopardise children who play ’midst the heath
By equipping cows with sets of teeth?”
“Ah, of course,” he replied, “an obvious impression 1
No, no, my friend; they’ll be used with discretion.
The use of these sets is wide and varying
And in time to come will revolutionise dairying.”
“I see,” I said, “they’ll be used in th’ spring
To crop th’ sweet grass and that sort of thing?”
“Hardly that, but they'll surely afford the cows
means
Of crunching up bushels of nuts and beans.
“And the very farmer who now loves to scoff he
Will change his tune when the kine give hot coffee.
And when from the churn comes fresh peanut butter
Th’ little farm children with delight will stutter!”
. ...D.M.C.: Doesn’t amount to a yarn... .W.D.F.:
“The Ruling Passion” didn’t keep us interested....
J.R.L.: Horrible... .D.McL.: The lines are weak
and commonplace. .. .Edmund D.: Says badly what
a couple of the papers have already said we 11....
R.H.W.: Too much like too many other things....
J.J.: More like careful exercises in verse than things
you really mean.... Eva G.: Too slight... .M.W.
(Cremorne) : While you rhyme “storm” with “corn”
and “morning” with “dawning” you won’t make
much melody.... Ernest O.: That is true enough of
pottery, but pottery was not discussed. No porce-
lain has yet been made in Australia... .M.H.W.:
This is a poor market for that pattern of goods.
. ...E.11.8.: Not a very thrilling account of an
ordinary happening... .J.8.P.: The “germ” operates
in a weakly wild fashion in verse that is a good
way below standard... .J.C.8.: Doesn’t get near....
Pete Me: Verse fair, but matter flimsy. .. .Blue-
bush : Hard to say which is best; easier to say
none of them are g00d.... A.W.M.: Fine example of
the rhymes that don’t:—
Have the tides receded
Oft since the era
When life went unheeded
And treasure was dearer?
Are his thoughts bettered
With the passing of years,
Or is he unfettered
With changeless ideas?
... . J.M.S-Y.: Your verse factory is as busy as ever,
but its wares won’t sell. Why not have the
machinery overhauled and use some oil-of-thought ?
Then the next 31 lyrics might not be so weak and
commonplace. .. .11.A.5.: It is thin and weak,; and
you seem to go out of your way to drag in the
corn-dawn rhyme.... Lyri C,: Says too little and
says it poorly A.A.A.: “Nelton” is not convinc-
ing. .. .C.J.F.: Doesn’t strike us hard enough
Estelle T.: Not much of a yarn there.... E.8.J.:
The end is obvious when the tale is half t01d....
Pegasus: Not running up to form, Peg..... W.T.S.:
No interest in it at present.... Strathgowan: Much
obliged to you. .. .E.8.J.: We have said all that many
times; and the other side was entitled to its kick.
.... Sooshelle: So little grain that the chaff isn’t
worth winnowing. .. .Old Dominie: Too long-winded.
....Walter G.: Not a very comprehensive survey,
is it?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.S.: It hobbled on its misshapen feet' to the
basket and flung itself in 8.L.: The enfant ter-
rible joke can be overdone. It can also be under-
done. Yours is raw. .. .E.T.: As flat as the Moon-
light Sonata played on a baircomb.... J.W.R.: Your
police court doesn’t suggest any we have attended.
“C.O.M.P."’: A friend of mine, approached
by two polished gentlemen who travelled
through the country in great style and
loudly asserted that fortunes were to be made
by investing in shares in their new insurance
co., took an option over 750 shares on which
he paid £7 10s.; also he signed an applica-
tion form, which he was assured would not
be valid unless he paid the balance of the
application money amounting to £3O. Never-
theless the co. immediately allotted the shares
and proceeded to collect the balance by issu-
ing a writ.

A YEAR ago Studebaker introduced its Duplex
xVbody, which provides open car freedom or
closed car protection, in 30 seconds, by simply
raising or lowering the roller side enclosures. Many
regard the Duplex body as the greatest advance since
the self-starter was perfected. In many markets,
the Duplex body (two cars in one) has rendered the
old style open car obsolete.
Studebaker, by producing all engines, bodies, clutches,
steering gears, gear boxes, differentials, springs, axles,
gray iron castings and drop forgings in its own plants,
makes one-profit cars —eliminating the profits of out-
side parts and body makers. It has thus brought
about the perfect co-ordination of units in its cars
and insured the maintenance of highest standards
in workmanship and materials.
Hundreds of Studebakers, running smoothly after
being driven upward of 100,000 miles, prove their
rugged strength and endurance.—Studebaker, South

THE precious little mite would rather chuckle and coo, and
show off its bonnie dimples, than be fretful and irritable.
Hot Summer months are trying for Baby, but mothers will find
that most of its ailments can be minimised, and the blood kept
pure and cool, by giving small daily doses of that celebrated
Preparation :
KRUSE’S .
This famous Antacid and Aperient is particularly valuable for
bottle fed babies. It prevents sourness after meals, and keeps
the stomach healthy and adtive. What is important is that
Kruse’s Fluid Magnesia contains no irritating elements
nor harmful drugs. In appearance it resembles a sparkling
mineral water. Children think it’s fun taking their little doses.
KRUSE’S FLUID MAGNESIA is a Family Medicine—good
for people of all ages, and specially designed as a corrective for
such disorders as Indigestion, Constipation, Nervous Irritability,
Rheumatism, SCc.
The large family bottle at 2/6 is the most economical
size to buy Every high-class Pharmacist stocks it.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Jim Carew” : What is the highest price
ever paid for flour in Australia? My dad,
who followed up most of the later gold
rushes and was one of the first on the Ovens
(Vic.), saw £l2 10s. paid for a bag there.
“Pat Bushie” : I went to our (N.S.W.)
courthouse for a statutory declaration form,
and was asked Is. 6d. for a blank document
containing only about 30 printed words on
ordinary paper. Private firms sell similar
forms for Id., but had none in stock. Yet
Lang and his offsider-iu-law McTiernan would
snort if you called them profiteers.
'** * *
“Alwyn” : The first wood-blocks for street-
making used in Australia were laid 85 years
ago. The road they paved was in front of
St. James’s Church, Sydney, and extending
towards Hyde Park Barracks, which latter
space is now occupied by Queen Victoria’s
statue. The blocks were cut by a party of
Canadians at Tarban Creek, Gladesville.
“Ricardo”: Car-minding has become a
business with vested interests in Brisbane.
One man has been doing so well that he is
unable to handle all the trade on his beat.
He advertised for a partner, and explained
to applicants that for a fiver down he would
introduce them to his clients. There was a
fortune in it, he said; but he is still looking
for a taker.
* * * *
“A.8.C.”: Louis Boutan, Professor of
Science at Bordeaux, has informed the
French Academy that it is impossible to dis-
tinguish between natural pearls and those
cultivated by the Japanese Mikimoto. He
asserts that Mikimoto has now produced
pearls which do not contain any foreign
body in the centre, and which even when
examined in section are identical with the
pearls produced by the oyster. Photographs
are submitted in proof of this. But whether
it is going to make any difference to Broome
and “Thirsty” depends wholly, or almost
wholly, on the figure at which Miki can
hatch his eggs.
“Another Weaver” : Re “Weaver’s” recent
plea for a bounty on yarn spun from Austra-
lian cotton. Late figures show that
£14,000,000 worth of unbleached, bleached
and printed cotton fabrics reach here annu-
ally from Britain alone. Plenty of store-
keepers would be glad to see the English
calicoes outed, as competition has forced
prices down until there is hardly any profit
in selling them. As for the consumer, he
would profit from the fact that English cot-
tons contain an excessive amount of dressing
that melts at the first washing, leaving- the
cloth “soft” and open. Were all calicoes
sold in a washed condition the undressed
Australian goods that naturallv “fill up”
after boiling would make much of the im-
ported stuff look like cheese-cloth.
“Coppertop”: I knew a blind man who
kept the wolf from the door as a profes-
sional draughts-player; he would take on
anyone for anything up to 10s. a game. I
came across him first in 1908 when travelling
from Bowen to Cooktown on the Arawatta.
His board was the usual size, but in the
centre of each square was a one-inch nail.
The white pieces were scraare with a hole
in the centre, and the black pieces were
round, similarly drilled. There were some
good chess- and draughts-playcrs on board,
but during that voyage he was unbeaten. He
made enough to pay his fare and a bit over,
for he was kept constantly at work. His
son accompanied him, and saw that the old
man got a square go.
* * * *
“Loco” : Consider the ramifications of Aus-
tralian railway traffic. On a recent day
in a Western Vie. railway-yard I saw a
truck (seven tons) of apples on the way to
Brisbane from Gorae, in the once despised
forest country near Portland. A truck of
potatoes was consigned from Ivoroit to Kal-
goorlie; next to it was chaff from Hamilton
for Red Cliffs, near Mildura. A truck of
briquettes came from Yallourn. Coal from
Newcastle was there in plenty, also from
Wonthaggi; timber, including street-paving
blocks, was in transit from Balmoral to Mel-
bourne. Numerous trucks of sheep and
cattle were en route from the rich pastures
of the West to Newmarket. It makes one
wonder how we managed before the days of
railways.
* * * *
“P. Pintpot”: The 35 pubs in Victoria
which are not to re-open after December 31
include some ancients, such as the Royal Oak
in Swanston-street and the Bush Inn in
Bouverie-street, Carlton; also the London-
derry in Collingwood, the pub which is owned
by Terence O’Callaghan, the wealthy dairy-
man who, according to evidence in the recent
trial of several detectives on blackmail
charges, is worth at least £60,000 —he gets
£lBOO compensation, and is lucky. But most
of them were frowsy, and several had a
string of black marks against them. The
biggest compensation to an owner is the
£1735 to be paid for the Criterion, Coleraine;
but the occupier gets only £250. The biggest
gross compensation goes to the old Lalla
Rookh, in North Melbourne, £2150 altogether
—£lsoo for the owner and £650 for the
licensee.
* * * *
“Hayseed”: “Pick” (B. l/10/’25) made
a mistake in stating that the marble at Win-
dellama (N.S.W.) is blue. It is black, and
takes a high polish. I have often wondered
why it has been left lying idle so long.
Many years ago I sent samples of slate,
manganese and other minerals to England,
but the black marble was the only thing for
which a price was offered. Of course, it
would not at that time pay the cost of
cartage to rail. The chief objections to it by
builders I tried to interest were that it was
too hard to cut and polish, that the thin,
thread-like, white veins running through
some of it depreciated its value, though most
people think they enhance it. I have seen
a sample take such a polish that it would
have made a good substitute for a mirror. It
is an immense deposit, and fairly easy to
quarry. I agree with “Pick” that the Fed-
eral Commissioners should make inquiries
about the Windellama marble —it is quite
handy to them.


_ Whatever Your
Skin Trouble
At this time of the year when pimples, blotches, boils,
abscesses and similar skin-ailments are so troublesome,
your over-burdened skin needs the purifying aid of
Zam-Buk.
Start now and coax your skin back to health with
nightly dressings of this balm—the first applications of
which will end the dreadful itching and act as a tonic.
The regular use of Zam-Buk has a far-reaching influence;
composed of highly-refined essences which are readily
absorbed by the skin, Zam-Buk soaks through the pores,
attacking the trouble at its source and so ridding the
tissues of all impurities.
Lastly, when all sore, inflamed parts have been
soothed and cleared, and all swellings allayed, there is a
splendid new growth of healthy, strong skin. Zam-Buk
cannot but have a wholly beneficial effect on your
skin, as it is free from animal fats and coarse mineral
drugs which only clog the pores and often retard healing.
Don’t endure fiery skin torture a day longer—get a box of Zam-Buk
from your chemist or storekeeper. Nothing can equal it in cases of eczema,
piles, poisoned wounds, scalp sores, ringworm, etc. Also as a sure healer for
cuts, bruises and burns. 1/6 per box or 3/6 (family size).

“Alwyn”: Melbourne's first photographer
(daguerreotype process) was one B. Good-
man, who opened in Little Flinders-street
in August. 1845. He guaranteed that the sit-
ting would not exceed five seconds, and that
the picture would be finished in four minutes.
He is reputed to have taken £B7O in four
months, and then he left unexpectedly for
Adelaide.
“The Rumpus’: Cities have their lucky
days. Alongside the Government Refriger-
ating Works in Wellington-street, Perth, is
a carriers’ rank, and about 2.30 p.m., when
traffic was heavy, the valve of the big boiler
of the ice-house blew out, shooting a volume
of steam amongst the scared horses, Six
lorry teams had bolted before their drivers,
who were holding a little political meeting
around the telephone call-box, could reach
for reins. Yet every runaway was pulled
up without as much as a scratch being
suffered.
“Ces”: The future of Yarra Bend reserve,
which holds the ruins of the Yarra Bend
Asylum, has been considered by a Board,
with Pinniger, Vic. Surveyor-General, at its
head. The recommendation is that it be a
permanent reserve for recreation purposes.
It will add 300 acres to Melbourne’s too-
small park areas. The proposals of the Bill
Posters’ Union that it should be cut up for
homes was properly turned down flat. The
only qualification is that a portion should be
set aside, if required, for a men’s V.D. clinic,
for which it is recommended a permissive
occupancy be given.
The late Justice a’Beckett (Vic.) had a
keen eye for errors in an affidavit, and when
he discovered anything that amused him he
would sharp his find. Scrutinising a docu-
ment before him in relation to an appeal
to the Full Court against the size of the
bill in a divorce suit, he noticed that the
letter “g” had been omitted by the typist
in the statement that there had been “nine
grounds in the petition for divorce.” Nine
rounds !” chuckled his Honor. “A good fight,
a very good fight.” Then, turning to Madden,
C J., who was notoriously fond of a boxing-
match: “With my learned brother as re-
feree.”
“Q.” : One of the most remarkable figures
in Australia is at present out of it. R. H.
Long, poet, carpenter, pacifist, spent 1--
months of the war years in Victorian gaols
for his opinions, gently but firmly expressed.
Since then he lias built a great deal of good
furniture and a few more poems and quaint
occasional verses. He has walked in various
directions, such as from Sydney to Mel-
bourne, wearing the handiest Matilda ever
composed. He and his Matilda have lately
been on the road together in Spain, France
and Switzerland. In London they attended
an anti-war conference, scenting it from
afar. A strongly-built man, with a bearded,
kindly, serene face, he is adored by children,
for whom he makes the best toys and games
on earth. In a world of prices and hurry
his is a personality that is quietly startling.
“Cosmo” : Is there an Australian woman
who is a better all-rounder than Marie
Henry, wife of Dr. Clifford Henry, of Ken-
more Mental Hospital, Goulburn (N.S.W.)?
She has been an inter-State tennis rep., has
won championships at swimming and ice-
skating, and has sailed her yacht in a cruise
off the N.S.W. coast. She can hold her own
in rowing, surfing, horse-riding, cycling and
mountain-climbing. She drives and repairs
her own car, can fire a rifle or revolver with-
out shutting both eyes, and can acquit her-
self creditably at hockey, basket-ball, fish-
ing, verse-writing and ski-ing. Her latest
“double” is to win the southern district
tennis championship (ladies) and take the
principal feminine part in “The Cingalee,
staged by the Goulburn Liedertafel.
“Wang”: I have always been distrustful
of persons with strings of letters after their
names since I knew a long-haired individual
who invaded a Vic. mining settlement and
hung out a plate which read “Prof. John
Bangs, A.8.C.D.E.F., Palmist and Phrenolo-
gist.” We took the letters to represent some
degrees he held; but one night in a burst of
candor he told me that the six initials stood
for “A Blanky Cert. Doesn’t Ever I ail. Still
even the phrenologist was outdone later by
a musician in the same township whose
shingle announced that he was William
Cornet, Teacher of Wind Instruments,
BB B B.B.B.B.” The seven B’s beat us
till ’somebody discovered that they stood for
Best Bugle Blower in the Blanky Ballarat
Brass Band.
“G.M.”: A building contractor con-
structed a motordrome in Melbourne at a
cost of £9890 and obtained a verdict for that
amount. When he went to collect he found
the ground was Crown land and there was
only a lease to satisfy his judgment. Acting
on legal advice the successful sfiitor got a
■fi. fa, writ and sent two “trusties” one
Saturday night to collect the cash takings,
amounting, it is said, to £940. The constable
and the two “trusties” found the money had
been neatly packed in two tin boxes and locked
up. The lawyers present agreed to seal the
boxes and give them in custody of the con-
stable till Monday morning at 10.30. And
when the box was opened the birds began to
sing, oh! isn’t this a dainty dish to place be-
fore the plaintiff. The boxes were chokeful
of the kind of gravel the contractor had used
in making his ferro-concrete!
“Schnorrer”: An Austrian professor has
expounded the theory that Solomon’s land
of Opliir was not in Africa at all, but Peru,
and that the Incas were descendants of Jews
who went there to look after the mines.
Curiously enough, this suggestion that
Jewish navigators went further afield in their
cockleshells than did the Phoenicians, who
got tin from Cornwall and voyaged around
Africa, is supported by a very ancient Jewish
scholar and historian, De Rossi, who m Ins
“Mc-or Enayim,” published in 1574, said: —
Although the sages of the Talmud held that the
earth is flat, they knew, none the less, what has
but recently been established by the Spanish navi-
gators. .. .namely, that there are people who walk
with their feet turned towards ours King Solomon,
in fact, knew of the existence of such a continent. ...
The term Ophir in the Bible is a reference to the
land of Peru in South America Still more clearly
and unmistakably is the Peru which the Spaniards
discovered referred to under the name of Parvann
(2 Chronicles iii, 6).
It is an interesting speculation, at any rate.

“It is with much

you know what a wonder-

For years I suffered from
Eczema and could not get
anything to give me relief
from this awful skin
trouble. I had doctors’ and
chemists’ prescriptions of
Ointments and Lotions,
but everything seemed to
irritate more, so I decided
to try Rexona Ointment,
and after two weeks’ treat-
ment received great bene-
fit. I shall always recom-
mend Rexona Ointment to
all who suffer in the same
way as I did, and will
always keep a tin of it in
the house. It is worthy
of the name —The Rapid

The Grey House.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
pulling down the old honse,
the grey house
-™- That stood among its pines upon the
hill,
And ghostly shadows tremble through the
roof-tree,
And come and go at will.
They’re pulling stone from stone upon the
grey house,
All vacant now are window-frame and
door,
And little, homeless, withered leaves are
drifting
Like feet upon the floor.
They’ve taken away the pines from the grey
house,
The tall pines that whispered to the sky,
And it seems to me a sadder sky leans lower
For these, lain down to die.
And I wonder if the winds that wake at
daylight,
I wonder if the little winds will come l
And find the hill of all its trees forsaken
And desolate and dumb.
I wonder if the winds that wake at midnight
Will come as they have come in nights of
yore,
And fumble for the ledges of the windows
And the lintels of the door.
Will they feel with flitting fingers for the
grey house
On the hill-head now so strangely still
and stark?
Will they cry like little children, half-
affrighted
Of the shifting-shadowed dark?
VICTORIA.
MARIE J. PITT.
Lullaby.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ORA woke, aching all over, to a
I misery of conditions which matched
the dreams that had tormented her
sleep. The storm still played noisily outside
the slab hut; the gusty rain slashed against,
the sides, and the gurgle of running water
and the dripping of raindrops from trees
which soughed as they bent under the wind
made a background of melancholy noise to
sounds within. The wind whistled through
the crevices in the walls, and splinters hang-
ing from the slabs were turned into strings
upon which it played weird music. In the
hut itself water fell dully to the mud floor
from breaks in the roof, the drip-drip a
maddening iteration. One of the slabs
flopped damply and heavily as the storm
toyed with it.
The dominant sound in the room itself
was the gusty snoring that came from one
of the huddled figures by the fire; but nearer
to her was the whimpering of the baby, twist-
ing on the bed of hessian stretched over a
sapling frame, where it lay with its mother,
who stirred from sleep to quiet it.
A thought of Dante's Inferno came into
Nora's mind with her waking; this seemed
so like part of it. Her mind, at first blank
in its memories, pieced quickly together the
incidents of the previous few hours. Again
she recalled the horses wallowing along the
muddy road, straining under the urge of an
anxious driver; the struggle through the
already turbulent waters of a creek; then the
renewed efforts of the driver to get greater
speed out of his horses and reach the last
watercourse between them and their objec-
tive, Tulleroo, before it became impassable.
The song of raging waters had reached her
as she sat inside the coach, telling her, even
before the stoppage of the coach spoke a
story of hopelessness, that the crossing of
what was ordinarily an almost dry water-
course was impossible. The driver’s esti-
mate that he could get through had failed ;
they were cut off in front and behind by tor-
rents rapidly increasing in volume and anger.
The driver had brought his horses round
and drawn them to this hut —the home of
a settler who had abandoned his holding in
despair. It offered some sort of shelter;
and when, while the driver attended to his
horses, the man he addressed as Mr. Brun-
ton brought in damp wood and leaves, and
shortly had a fire smoking into a blaze, there
was even some measure of comfort. There
were also the hessian beds which the settler
had left as they stood when he went out.
To Nora the despair that had driven the
settler out seemed to fill the place. It haunted
her, fitting into her mood of loneliness and
bitter disappointment. It seemed to her
that the world was spiritually just the miser-
able place that the conditions around her
suggested; there was always the storm in
which the spirit, whatever defiance it might
adopt, was chilled with a feeling of power-
lessness. Though still in her early
twenties, she was a disappointed girl.
She had struggled so* hai'd to get
away from the drabness of the home
in which she had been reared, and where,
as the eldest daughter, she had drudged ; and
her successes in making her way to the
Teachers’ College had filled her with a sense
of triumph. But now she felt that all the
triumph had brought to her was an appoint-
ment at a small country school, where, or
at other similar places, she would still drudge
until she withered. Cut off from her parents
by their resentment, she was a lonely woman,
nursing under her cold self-possession an
ache for warmer things.
The baby's whimpering rose to a wail,
and with a sense of increased discomfort
she pulled her rug over her head. She hated
babies; the care of younger children in a
hard-working farmer’s family had filled her
with aversion for them. The mother, in
sleepy annoyance, shook the child, and it
wailed louder.
From under her rug she heard subdued
movements and a sizzle that told her more
fuel was going on the fire. Then someone
was standing near, and she heard a mascu-
line voice whisper: “Can I sing that baby
to sleep for you?”
The baby’s wailing faded slightly as it
was carried away, and a not very musi-
cal voice crooned to it. Shortly the crying
stopped, and she heard only the very soft
pad of feet np and down the mud floor, and
a voice crooning in a whisper:—
“A lulu-lulu-lulu-lu, mah baby,
Do you want the moon to play with”....
She nestled down into her rug; unmusical
as the singing was, it somehow brought a
sense of restfulness and comfort; she could
almost imagine that she was a baby herself,
and was being crooned to sleep. A tinge
of amusement flooded softly over her bitter-
ness. She was amused that the cold, hard
and confident Mr. Brunton —she had recog-
nised his voice—who had taken the lead in
making conditions less uncomfortable in the
hut like one boni to command, should be
padding the floor with the baby of a
stranger; and she was amused by the idea
that he should be singing her to sleep as
well as the infant. Presently, as the croon-
ing from time to time died, and then re-
started as the baby raised a protest against
the silence, siic wondered dreamily at his
patience.
She was dozing peacefully when a new
idea came to wake her: it was shameful that
she should be lying there while the man
who had done much for her comfort was
carrying on a work which, as a woman, was
more hers.
She looked out from her rug. The woman
on the other bed was sleeping heavily, and
by the fire, on one of the boxes they had
found in the hut and placed there as scats,
Brunton was' sitting, the baby in his arms.
He looked up with surprise as she came to
him, protesting slightly as she took the baby,
but evidently somewhat relieved. With the
baby in her arms she sat on the box beside
him.
“It cramps your arms a bit.” he said. “I
thought you were the mother at first; but
if you don’t mind acting as relief, I'll be
glad. The mother’s pretty exhausted, I dare
say.”
“I ought to have relieved you before,” she
said. “As a matter of fact, I am not very
fond of babies. There were eight in our
family, and I was the eldest.”
■ “You got tired,” he said, sympathetically.
“I love babies myself.”
The infant provided an interlude. Some
knowledge of its changed possession brought
it to wakefulness and it stared at Nora
and began to cry. Brunton whispered sooth-
ingly to it; its head turned to the sound of
his voice, and it kicked to get towards him.
They laughed at its obvious rebellion at be-
ing separated from him; and when he took
it again it stared at him silently as he
crooned, and then contentedly snuggled into
him and went to sleep again.
“Poor little kiddie!” he said. “It reminds
me of an old time in my life.”
“Yes?” she asked, after a while, when
he had sunk into a silent gazing at the fire.
The fire had evidently brought old dreams
to him.
“I was left an orphan, without money,
when I was a youngster,” he said. “I've
made my way now, and I’m not ashamed of
it; but the State had to take charge of me.
I was boarded out to a cockie and his wife:
and nursing this one reminds me of then-
baby. She and I were pals. It wasn’t a
happy home, although they were what you
would call good people. They had an idea
that duty and hard work were the only
things in life. They weren’t unkind —only
cold and hard. The man worked himself as
hard as he worked me; and his wife kept
the place so clean that you could hardly
live in it for fear of dirtying it. She was
always working, too : and somehow I got to
looking after the baby a good bit, and liked
it. I’d walk her up and down at night
singing to her; the little beggar used to
look up at me and smile all over her face;
and she’d cry to come to me, even from her
own mother and father. I was a pretty
lonely kid; and the baby always made me
feel that I had a chum—someone who really
eared for me more than anyone else. It
was that sort of feeling that used to make
me walk up and down, a little beggar of
fourteen, with my back nearly breaking,
carrying that infant, and be happy over it.
Even long after it—right up to now, years
after I broke away and made my way in the
world- —wherever I see a baby I get a sort
of tender feeling thinking of my little chum.”
The baby provided anoth-er interlude. Wak-
ing again it decided that there was some-
thing missing and squirmed, whimpering, in
his arms.
“Cunning little beggars!” he whispered,
smiling. “She remembers I was walking her
up and down, and wants some more of it.
They don’t believe in being cheated!”
As he paced up and down again, singing
gently, Nora, with a softness in her heart
which seemed ridiculous to her, watched him
with a sidelong glance. PTnaccountably she
did not see him as he was then, a firm-faced,
staunch-lined man, but as a weedy boy,
scrubby and tousle-haired, and with much-
worn clothes, staggering up and down a
farm-house floor with a baby that seemed
monstrously too big for him. A warmness
of heart strange to her came as she con-
jured the picture. She herself had known
just such a household as he had described
to her : the husband of strict probity in his
dealings and an immense capacity for work-
ing both himself and other people; the wife
who esteemed a harsh word a much lighter
sin than a speck of dirt.
“You’re nearly asleep,” said Brunton’s
voice by her ear, startling her into wTakeful-
ness. “Better lie down. I’ll tell you what
you might do—you might take the baby in
beside you. If I try to put it with its
mother it is sure to wake; but if you don’t
mind”
She thrilled as he laid the sleeping child
with her. drawing the rug over with hands
wonderfully gentle. From the drudgery
her home life she had escaped by working
almost frantically to pass examinations, and
she had learnt to assure herself that she hated
the babies whose insistent demands on her
time kept her back; but now she associ-
ated the vision which had so warmed her
heart with the baby against her breast, and
she felt moved by a swelling protective love
for it.
It was gone from her side when she
awoke. The mother, now arisen, had it.
There was a bustle of preparation, and the
sun was streaming in through the windows
of the hut, from which someone had torn
the waterproof cloth which had helped to

keep out last night’s tempest. The coach-
driver had ridden down to the creek and
found the water falling so fast that there
was a prospect of getting over in an hour or
so; Brunton had ridden to a selection and
brought back food.
She felt almost hurt that, in his pre-
occupation in preparing their breakfast, he
had no time for her—-or the baby he had so
tenderly nursed the night before. She had
had a strangely comfortable sleep, with a
heart at ease, happy and free from bitter-
ness ; it had been filled with dreams of a
weedy boy in patched clothes pacing a floor
with a baby in his arms, singing softly;
she remembered the songs as if they had been
long familiar to her; and she noted with
curiosity there had been some in her dream
that he had not crooned to the baby last
night. Now, awake, she had a sense of loss.
The self-contained man, with his air of assur-
ance, his prosperous clothes and his stout
well-being, looked so unlike the boy of her
visions that to associate them seemed absurd.
Yet when they went out to enter the wait-
ing coach, he having offered to carry the
baby for the mother, an over-wrought woman
with the lines of trouble ill-borne on her
face, he stepped back to show her delightedly
how the child was smiling at him.
“You didn’t sing this !” she said suddenly,
and hummed an air that was throbbing in
her mind.
He stared at her strangely.
“Didn’t I? No, I don’t think I did: but
I used to sing that years ago to my little
baby-chum. Strange that it should occur
to you !’
“You must have sung it,” she said.
He prepared to help her in, and then his
eyes fell on a case which had been left
in the coach, marking her seat, and the name
stared at him—“N. Dryden.” His action
as he turned to her pulled her back off the
‘step.
“N. Dryden!” he exclaimed. “Nora Dry-
den ! Why, you must he the. little baby
I sang to sleep when I was a kid ! My little
Nora !”
She felt the warm blood of surprise flood-
ing her face. She knew then why his sing-
ing had seemed so familiar to her —why it
had brought so much ease to her when there
had seemed nothing but misery; a sub-con-
scious memory of her babyhood had been
awakened.
“There is no room on the box seat for you
and none for me in here,” he whispered,
“but at Tulleroo I must see y0u.... my
little Nora!”
Her heart was singing as she entered the
coach; the loneliness had gone from it; and
shortly she borrowed the baby from its will-
ing mother. It smiled at her as she fondled
it; and her heart was melting with tender-
ness as she kissed it.
She loved babies.
HAMER.
The Phantom Flock.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU never know what evolution can do.
Take the case of Little Bo Peep,
bar-tender in the hotel at Boganbong
and a sort of by-product of the old nursery
rhyme.
This Little Bo Peep was six feet high,
handsome, with slow, slumbrous eyes, a quiet
voice, a cultured manner and masculine gar-
ments.
The last item was quite in order. Little
Bo Peep was a man, Harry Jaffray by name.
You may have heard of him. The manner in
which he acquired his nickname shows, as
I have said, just what evolution can do
when it gets busy.
Little Bo Peep he lost his sheep. He lost
them in a drought, like many another settler.
But there was a difference. He told us about
it one evening.
“Yes,” he assured us, “I lost every one
of them in that drought. And lucky I did!
If I hadn’t I'd have sold them at ten bob a
head and lost quids apiece on ’em.”
“That seems rather extraordinary, what!”
commented Eyne-Weeton, the English chap
w r ho acted as rouseabout on Garvey’s run
and called himself the wood-and-water wallah
because he had a brother in India.
“The whole thing was extraordinary,” re-
joined Harry. “You see, Mr. Eyne-Weeton,
it was this way. The fellow who was going
to buy them cried off the bargain when he
found I couldn’t deliver them. Then when
the drought broke I sold them to other chaps
who were wanting to re-stock. I reckon I
sold those sheep at least four times for
about a couple of quid a head each time.”
“But I thought you said you had lost
them in the drought?” queried Eyne-Weeton.
“Too true, I did,” asseverated Harry. “Fif-
teen hundred of them in a single paddock.
That was out at the Twelve, Mile.”
“And yet you say you sold them?” Eyne-
Weeton argued. “I say, Mr. Jaffray, I may
be a new-clium —what! —but you can’t make
me believe that. The fellows ’d want to see
the bally animals before they paid for
them.”
“Bet your life they would !” Harry assured
him. “You see, the whole thing was a bit queer.
It was a sort of phantom flock —now you
see it and now you don’t. It was out on
the Western plains. I had a run there, good
country, especially the paddock at the Twelve
Mile. About two thousand acres there,
fenced, rabbit-proof, dingo-proof, tick-proof
almost, with some good waterlioles and nice
shade. Useful sort of shade —kurrajongs
planted in patches all over the paddocks.
When the drought came we didn’t worry
about that paddock—reckoned it was right,
and, anyway, we were too busy trying to
save the jumbucks in the home paddocks.
No hope. We lopped feed and carried water,
but it was too big a job, and after a bit
there were just rotting carcases everywhere,
and crows, and then just bones bleaching in
the sun. When I saw it was hopeless I
decided to concentrate on the Twelve Mile
flock. Intended to ride out there the next
morning, when along comes a galoot wanting
to buy ewes. He thought the drought was
going to break, and reckoned to buy up cheap
and get in early. But we knew better —
there was no hope of rain till next mon-
soon season. But I was so fed up of the
struggle that I offered him the whole fifteen
hundred at the Twelve Mile for ten bob a
head. lie agreed, and next day we rode
out to inspect them.
“It was 10 in the morning when we
reached the Twelve Mile. Things looked
worse than I had expected. Not a leaf of
herbage, and the waterhole near the gate
was just dry clay. What was worse, all
the kurrajongs within view had been nibbled
sheep-liigh. Clipped as clean and straight
as an English ornamental garden. You
know the idea, Mr. Eyne-Weeton ?”
“Perfectly, Mr. Jaffray. A top-hole com-
parison.”
“I dismounted,” continued Harry, “and
stooped down. By getting below the level
of the foliage I could see a long way through
the patches of kurrajong. Not a woolly in
sight. We guessed they might be over at
some of the other waterlioles, and rode across.
There was water in two holes at the far
side; but still not a sheep visible, alive or
dead. That was the puzzling part of it.
No sheep, no bones. And they don’t usually
take their skeletons with them when they
go off to the Betterland on permanent agist-
ment. It looked as* though the fences were
down.”
“Undoubtedly,” agreed Eyne-Weeton, “the
only possible supposition, what!”
“But,” Harry qualified, “there was an
argument against that, especially over to-
ward the waterlioles. All about the ground
there was fresh evidence that sheep had been
there very recently. One suspected their
presence, if I may say so, from various hints
they had let fall. Anyway, there was no
time that day to inspect the boundaries, but
we rode over enough of the paddock to have
seen the sheep had they been there. Hot
work it was, too —blazing sun and no shade.
The kurrajongs had not been eaten off high
enough for us to ride under them except
where an odd high branch projected beyond
the others.
“We went back home, and the galoot was
so disgusted that he saddled up next morning
and rode off without a word —goosed the
sale, as I told you. Next day I started off
bright and early for the Twelve Mile, and
rode the boundaries. They were perfect;
hardly a skeeter could have got through,
much less a sheep. I’d never heard of jum-
bucks doing kangaroo jumps, so I guessed
they must still be somewhere inside that con-
founded paddock.
“It was becoming a bit eerie. They
couldn’t have got out; they weren’t dead;
there was still fresh evidence that they
were alive in it; yet not a sight of ’em. A
phantom flock if ever there was. At least
that idea occurred to me, and it made my
spine go shivery. Then as I rode back across
the paddock I became aware of a sudden
pattering sound just behind me, like trotters
tapping on the hard-baked ground. I looked
round quickly, sort of startled. Fact is, I
was getting jumpy. But there was nothing
-—no little baa-lamb running to its mummy
or to little Mary or anything like that.”
“A really amazing affair, what!” remarked
Eyne-Weeton. “At Home we have quite a
number of haunted castles.”
“After that, as I rode about the paddock
I felt thoroughly creepy. Everything silent,
yiou know—-noonday hush, as Roderic Lind-
say Kendall puts it! But every now and then
there was that little tapping sound on the
hard ground. Made me wonder if the sheep
had evoluted into rabbits and gone under-
ground. But I could see no signs of any
sheep-burrows.
“A few days later Bill Brannigan, over
at Ivoolak, called in, and I told him about
it. He laughed like the deuce at first, but in
the end he agreed to ride out with me after
lunch. It was getting late afternoon when
we reached the far waterlioles at the Twelve
Mile, and blow me if the sheep weren't there,
drinking, wandering about, contented and
rolling fat. Bill merely remarked: ‘We’ll
have some of that when we get back.’ ‘Some
of what?’ I asked. ‘Some of what you've
been drinking lately,’ he said.
“I didn’t get annoyed with Bill for sug-
gesting that I'd been blind drunk, because
I was feeling rather happy. Wherever the
dam’ sheep had been they’d come back, that
was the main thing.
“But about a week later, when I visited
the paddock once more, they had again van-
ished. Haunted paddock, phantom flock —it
had me beat. And there was still that little
patter of sound every now and then, like
ghostly feet. But what made me real jumpy
was when that tapping sound hit my hat. I
nearly jumped out of the saddle. I took off
the old felt and found one explanation in
the dent on top of it. But I was still
puzzled, because I’d never before heard of
flying sheep. I looked aloft, and found that
I had ridden under some high projecting
branches of a kurrajong.
“After that I rode all over the paddock,
still keeping my winkers aloft, and I was
soon convinced about the wonders of Evolu-
tion and all that. The sheep, when they’d
eaten the kurrajongs up as high as they
could reach, had developed claws to climb
the trees.”
“But, I say,” interrupted Eyne-Weeton,
“you’re not telling us that as a fact, Mr.
Jaffray, what!”
“Yes, I just am telling you,” responded
Bo Peep, dreamy-like. “And they had found
it so cool and shady up there that they had
developed the habit of roosting in the foliage
during the heat of the day. I sold them a
few months later, when the drought broke,
but they didn’t want to go. We had to
chop down every kurrajong in that paddock
before we could muster them. Even then
the chap wlio’d bought the flock left them
behind as a bad bargain, same as everyone
else who bought them.”
“How was that?” asked Eyne-Weeton.
“Well, you see,” drawled Bo Peep, “it
was hard work droving them. Every patch
of trees they’d come to, the bally things ’d
run up and roost in the branches. Yes. I
sold that lot four times before a new-ehum
English chap played a low-down trick on me
and got away with them.”
“By Jove!” exclaimed Eyne-Weeton with
revived eagerness.
“Yes,” said Bo Peep, “he looked quiet
enough, but he’d brought a tree-climbing dog
along with him.”

The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries 6f cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2f-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only ohe attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure eitra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
