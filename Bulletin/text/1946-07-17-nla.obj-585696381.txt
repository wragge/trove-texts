LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
CARLYE HOUSE.
THIS picture shows the house in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, as it
stood toward the end of the Queen’s reign. Here was the
home of Thomas Carlyle from 1834 until his death in 1881. It
is identified by an excellent medallion portrait, and was converted
into a permanent Carlyle Museum, which was opened in 1895, the
centenary of the great man’s birth. Carlyle himself wrote to his
wife, on taking possession of the house, that it was probably
the best we have ever lived in a right old strong, roomy brick
house, 'built nearly one hundred and fifty years ago, and likely
to see three races of these modern fashionables fall before it
comes down.” “We lie safe at a bend of the river,” he also wrote,
“and see nothing of London except by day the summits of St.
Paul’s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey, and by night the gleam
of the great Babylon.” Carlyle House remained a memorial to
him who was one of the greatest forces in moulding the glorious
Victorian age.

The Rad Page
OF BILLY ROSEN'S BULL.
The first glimpse of the domestic life
of animals in Brian James’s Cookabundy
Bridge (Angus and Robertson) is mildly
amusing but not, it might seem, of any
particular significance. It records, with-
out emphasis, the opinions of Billy
Rosen’s bull and a herd of cows on some
bullocks that have been let into their
pasturage.
There is a reference to the bovine
species again on page 29 when a small
boy, visiting his grandfather, demands
loudly to be shown “the old cow with
the big sock” ; but this is misleading—th
old cow with the big sock is grandfather
a somewhat miserly old gentleman be
lieved by his fond descendants to hav
buried his money under a peach-tree
the days of Jack Lang.
However, there are genuine animal
again on page 44 and page 45 in the
story called “Jacob’s Escape.” Jacob
has been insulted by his wife Elizabeth
—in front of the pigbuyer, at that —and
is about to leave home “for ever.” He
encounters Elizabeth’s poodle:
Then Jacob went to the house. Eliza-
beth’s poodle, who had always treated
Jacob with the contempt poodles have for
e underlings, was at the door. He ignored
Jacob. A long unused rage came over
Jacob; he kicked the poodle right across
the room. The poodle yelped and whinged,
and had a most satisfactory dint in it's side.
Exultation was only momentary—Jacob was
all repentance, but the poodle didn’t be-
lieve it, and whimpered under the sofa.
Nobody who has ever wished to be
unkind to a poodle—and who has not? —
could fail to respond to this paragraph
Brian James’s animals begin to challenge
the attention. How accurately the poodle’s
mind, if not its body, is described —tha
whimpering under the sofa! And there
follows a note on that moody anc
malevolent tribe, the blue cattle-dog:
The house was all darkness now, and a
big moon was rising over the Cookabundy
Ranges into t'he clear winter sky. Jacob
set out and sneaked blunderingly through
the orchard. Sailor, the blue cattle-dog,
came down to inspect him. Sailor sniffed
non-committally, and then went back to
his cornsack at the kitchen door. At least
it could be said of Sailor that he treated
Jacob tolerantly—almost as an equal-.
The next story, “Punch and Lightning,”
is woven around a pair of horses. Brian
James tells, among other anecdotes, how
Sammy, owner of the horses, once sacked
a man who did not understand them:
Choom tried, purely from a sense of duty,
to get greater speed out of Punch and
Lightning by flicking them with the reins
—a treatment not understood and much re-
sented. Bad relations having been firmly
established, Choom heaved a big hard clod
at Punch, taking him at or near the butt of
the tail. With becoming modesty, Punch
jammed his tail down tight. A second clod
similarly placed on Lightning led to mutiny
and flight. “I sacked him then and there,
sick as I was,” said Sammy. No doubt
Choom deserved it.
Bullocks, Billy Rosen’s bull, cows, dogs,
horses —the domestic menagerie is in-
creasing rapidly. And, in a sense, acci-
dentally.
These humorous and realistic portraits
are, of course, different in every way
from the usual “animal stories” which are
intended as a kind of escape into the
wilds — Man-Shy, or Tarka the Otter —and
which, though Brian James’s refreshing
freedom from sentimentality is worth
noticing in relationship to them, have
other, more poetic virtues. Brian James
does not intend to compete in this field ;
nor, even, did he set out in Cookabundy
Bridge to create a portrait-gallery of
domestic animals. The book —which
shouldn’t be confused with “The Cooka-
bundy Chronicles,” now running in short-
story form through The Bulletin —is
concerned with the human animal; who,
male or female, comic or tragic, drunk
or sober, alive or dead, is pointed to per-
fection. “Jacob’s Escape” is not really
about the poodle or the cattle-dog, but
about Jacob; and in its understanding of
character, its subtle binding of comedy
and pathos, its profundity of human wis-
dom and its complete mastery of form,
it is as fine a short story as has ever been
written in the world. It would do credit
to De Maupassant. “Gant and His
Horses” —that unforgettable picture of a
hard and repellent man who, when his
horses are killed in an accident, weeps—
is not really about the animals, but about
Gant. And it is a masterpiece.
But so, too, in a minor way, is the
pig named Dolf, who, in a story of that
macabre comedy which seems appropri-
ate to his race, is threatened with a dread-
ful death:
Dolf had not been fed since the previous
midday, for old Charlie held that you
couldn’t starve them enough in the day or
two before killing. But that was some-
thing you couldn’t well explain to Dolf so
that he’d clearly understand. He was
spending most''of his time with his front
feet on the top rail of his sty, head just
above the rail, and giving voice to his re-
sentment at the way he was being treated.
He had good lungs, and so the world
learned that Dolf had a definite grievance.
He kept his little, wicked eyes on the
house, and at the slightest sign of any
movement there he raised his squealing to
undreamt-of heights.
The buckets were swung on the galley,
and old Charlie touched off the fire. Big
Jack strolled over to interview Dolf, spoke
pleasantly to him, and reached out to feel
his broad back and scratch it. Dolf
reckoned all this had no reference to
honest tucker, grunted very gutturally and
suspiciously, and retired to the middle of
his pen. A much less intelligent pig than
Dolf would have seen something foully
wrong with all this easy familiarity from a
comparative stranger.
Casually, then, simply because he like
animals, is amused by them and can
resist writing about them, Brian Jame
has stocked, as it were, a whole country
side in these stories. To complete th
survey, one should mention—not forget
ting the delightful “Cows in the Lane’
and a score or more admirable horses, fo
which he has the special affection of al
good Australians —the fowls, “lordec
over by a very rakish-looking red rooster’
who took possession of the verandah
“The Casey Country,” and the cat named
Tibby, “mother of thirty,” who sat on
the “heasy chair” John Henry had bough
for his wife on “Cheque Day.”
But while Brian James has thus “acci
dentally” been filling the odd corners o
his stories with sketches of the domestic
animals, he has unconsciously been giving
the clearest possible proof that his storie
are in the richest and most truly Aus
tralian tradition: that of Steele Rudd
Lawson, Dyson, Furphy and Eve Langley.
No one who has read The Pea Pickers
could forget the mare named Seldom-fed
upon whose back rode Steve and Blue
and Charlie and Pricie-ole-man in the
thunderstorm after they had stolen Sulli
van’s oranges:
The thunder drummed in the ranges, the
lightning flashed blue and green and gold
in the black sky, and on the greqn grass
the bony old mare pirouetted with thin
upstretched throat and feet raised to the
heavens as though carrying on her hooves
a tray of whisky and soda to Olympus.
Furphy has his horses and his bullocks
Dyson spent one of the funniest nights in
Australian literature trying to prevent
cow from sharing his lean-to beside
shack in the bush; Steele Rudd’s Joe—
that marvellous and monstrous boy—has
his ants and his snakes and his lizards
and his mice and that unfortunate dog
which mistook him for a kangaroo ; anc
Lawson, of course —who could forget
“The Loaded Dog” and “Bill, the Ven-
triloquial Rooster”?
Round and round the woodheap they
went, and round the shed, and round the
house and under it, and back again, and
round the woodheap and over it and round
the other way, and kept it up for close on
an hour. Bill’s bill was just within an inch
or so of the game-rooster’s tail-feathers
most of the time, but he couldn’t get any
nearer, do how he liked. And all the time
the fellers kept chyackin’ Page and singing
out “What price y’r game ’un, Page? Go
if, Bill! Go it, old cock!” and all that
sort of thing. Well, the game-rooster went
as if it was a go-as-you-please, and he
didn’t care if it lasted a year. He didn’t
seem to take any interest in the business,
but Bill got excited, and by and by he got
mad. He held his head lower and his
wings further and further out from his
sides, and prodded away harder and harder
at the ground behind, but it wasn’t any
use. Jim seemed to keep ahead without
trying. They stuck to the woodheap to-
wards the last. They went round first one
way for a while and then the other for a
change, and now and then they’d go over
the top to break the monotony; and the
chaps got more interested in the race than
they would have been in the fight—and
bet on it, too. But Bill was handicapped
with his weight. He was done up at last;
he slowed down until he couldn’t waddle,
and then, when he was thoroughly knocked
up, that game-rooster turned on him, and
gave him the father of a hiding.
To analyse the subtle differences in
the writing of Lawson, Furphy, Eve Lang-
ley and Brian James would be a fascinat-
ing theme for an essay; and some day
the scholars will be doing it. The won-
derful effects Lawson could get with his
sketchy construction and his spare, harsh,
colloquial style; the wild fantasy and
poetry that lift The Pea Pickers quite
above the ordinary stream of Australian
prose ; the bubbling good humor and the
firm grip of the Australian earth that just
—and only just—redeem Such Is Life
from an arch and academic remoteness.
... If Brian James falls short of Eve
Langley in any respect it is in passion
and imagination; Lawson’s genius, too,
may have burned with a fiercer flame ; if
he surpasses all' three in any respects
it is in maturity and readability,
for his prose flows far more
smoothly and richly than Lawson’s, he
never repels the reader with Lawson’s
sentimentality or dejection, and he is free
from Furphy’s intolerable discursiveness.
However, it is not with differences that
the present survey is concerned, but with
similarities ; and, m particular, with the
comcidence that Brian James can describe
a Horse or a pig as accurately and amus-
mg y as Lawson described a rooster.
t is, ot course, no chance coincidence
u an inevitability. Brian James is in no
n Lawson—his style and his
thod are altogether different. But, like
Lawson s, his stories grow directly out
firct Austra lian earth. Possibly the
• S ™ q r em l nt , j or , wn J ;e i rs °f this kind
t they should be able convincingly
pamt a blade of grass. Brian James’s
landscapes are certainly both convincing
n lovely; and his animals—which live
c osest to the earth—are triumphantly
o. lo think as a pig thinks, without
a se sentiment, is no mean achievement,
r is a sign of humility ; of a proper rever-
humblest* creatures of the
artn , a guarantee that when the author
approaches human beings he will portray
them with an equal realism.
As, or course, Brian James does. Small
boys and grandfathers, spinsters and
ousewives, successful men and failures,
nard men and easygoing men, religious
and scoundrels, he treats them all
with the same amused respect as he pays
to Billy Rosen’s bull. One is meeting
really, in Cookabundy Bridge, a fully-
matured mind ; and it is at once astonish-
ing and appropriate that it should have
expressed itself with such completeness:
the mastery of style and form, the toler-
ance and balance of outlook, the un-
faltering understanding of character, the
comprehensive view of the human scene
that ranges from infancy to old age, from
the cradle to the coffin ; and the breadth
of the emotional range that extends the
whole distance from the tragedy of a
drowned child to the drama of “Shots
in the Orchard” and the earthy comedy
of “Hawkins’s Pigs.” And though, in
its total effect, it is a book of country
comedies, there are also stories of the
city, the suburbs and the sea.
Brian James is certainly a man to read;
he is also a man to watch. Cookabundy
Bridge alone—it comprises 42 stories, a
few reprinted from his paperback First
Furrow —is enough to establish him as
the natural successor to Lawson
and Furphy. And if he keeps on as
he is going— The Bulletin is now pub-
lishing his “Cookabundy Chronicles” and
he has recently completed a novel —he
may make a very big name indeed.
A DRUM FOR BEN BOYD.
(Concluded.)
IX. A PIONEER OF MONARO.
I have loved two things deeply: the earth and
silence,
Two giant bulks furrowed by cold harmony,
Petrified rhythms, with eternal rhythmic chal
lenge.
Peace bound me to this land —peace in thre
shapes:
The color, the shadow, the noiseless mountain
beyond.
Here, between the beach and the mystic Centre
I shape a forming foothold and the future;
If I have grown quiet as my land, remember
That to conquer mountains one must think a
a mountain.
And these still places wherein, with no flutte
or tumult
My being will gutter and dissolve, owe me one
debt:
That I, foe of time, be not utterly extinguished
Who robs me of this due has my final hatred
I know this Boyd: a builder of lighthouse
towers
Maintained for his own craft only—let other
perish;
That squared stone is his own monument.
He has given us other samples of his building
An evil town, veined with corruption and
murder,
Clinging like a swollen leech to the bay’s lips
He does not love this country; why come here
Trampling my peace, trampling my very life?
He holds all the cards —even time is with him
Time, lover of anything gaudy, hollow, rotten
If he and I were dead, I might grapple his
ghost;
No money nor influence could help him then
And yet I should go down—he is the stronger
Time and a legend will steal my name from the
earth.
X.
After the groups at corners, the upraised .fist
The perennial bewilderment of the suddenly un
employed,
Comes uncertainty: a pause for the reefing anc
twist
Of new events and patterns in the dark pers-
pective
Of future —a time when the present is null anc
void.
And the man on the bridge of his own self-
scuttled wreck?
You cannot picture him broken or prostrate;
Success was the terror that might have tensec
his back
To an unnatural arc, turned him away, out-
patient,
Healed and thoroughly dead in his right mind
and fate.
There were no ghosts, no phantom, cheering
crowds,
No flapping of the air with guns from an an-
chored schooner,
None watched the yacht tack quietly with lean-
ing shrouds
Towards storm—and one line in an outgoing
list:
“Sailed: Wanderer, R.Y.S. Mr. B. Boyd,
owner.”
And, savoring the sea-blow, quivering with re-
lease,
New visions homing the hawk to his grey-
cragged eyes,
The fallen gentleman feels the only peace
Possible to flame-like heart's: the piling up
Of driftwood, new fuel of enterprise.
Now for his friends is the time of dusk and
rumor,
Echoes picked up in the wind and whirled about,
Talk of fabulous yellow metals, a raging dreamer,
Gun-duels —silence. *
In the flung surf of his name
White candles fume and sputter, and die out.
XI. THE CAPTAIN OF THE OBERON.
I have never before held death, pale and
polished, in my hands,
Nor dreamed it so round and empty and
motionless ...
Interesting job I thought, quite a touch of
romance,
This search for a dead man’s skull to placate
some vault,
With a useful bonus if the search proved sue-
cessful *
And I’ll admit that the man had intrigued me,
A fairytale customer with a trick of vanishing,
Leaving a thousand yarns. But I could fool
him
With a Government charter behind me, to track
him down
f alive, or ransom his bones. Find the skull,
they reckoned,
And we know all the secrets —well, I’ve done
that; . .
But something triumphs here and it’s not their
triumph.
N.s.w.
Something over my shoulder keeps repeating
That this, in my hands, is a guess or maybe a
lie.
The usual dull slog through the islands, with
the sky quivering,
Gasping for air, the water oily and steaming,
And a pillar of squall moving here and there;
At Guadalcanal, a couple of smashed canoes,
Rotted to paper-thickness; the long flat beaches
Empty of motion but shaken by wandering
sounds;
Then the maddening haggle with local savages,
Finally to receive this small, grey shell
Streaked in places try green lines of fungus.
As I said before, he has t'he laugh on me,
Leans over my shoulder, mocking the thing I
clutch
And poise and balance. Dead men have the
power
To mock us even while we juggle their very
bones;
They have slipped clean out of illusion and they
grow:
Six feet when he died —this fellow would top
a cloud!
The thing’s too full of ghosts—I hate the feel
of it:
Holding it is like splintering a mirror
•And finding a thousand faces round your boots.
XII. JOHN WEBSTER.
Perhaps I foresaw the future of this last voyage,
Boyd’s schemes losing all touch with realism,
His hands flickering and nervous, his eyes
baffled;
Thougu, wnen the gold-rush struck on a barren
core,
And his search was just another giant failure,
He didn’t care twopence, positively seemed to
rely
On a chain of failures —God alone knew his
ambitions.
Perhaps money was running short: that would
' clip
His wings and cage him up in normality;
Perhaps, though he talked with the usual gust
and force,
He realised well that this scheme of island re-
publics
Appeared to his friends and foes and himself
as a sign,
As the first cairn on a final road to madness.
I am growing old; my eyesight fumbles badly,
So facts of the past are my only speculation;
I can see now that as we left San Francisco,
The glittering housefronts and those coal-blue
hills
Dropping in rigid folds out of the sky,
And the small buff windmills slowly turning
over, „
We might have prophesied, hoisted a black sail.
Once out in the mist, taking the falling weather,
Boyd seemed to drink in color; when he spoke
You almost saw flesh and ribs within his
schemes;
You saw a new State in the tropics, a huge
army.
But more often came the new weapon of irony
Turned in against himself; something was shift-
ing
And breaking up, some power that had kept
his eyes
Turned outward only. The end came none too
soon.
Now, when my thoughts seek his last desperate
day,
All’s torn and rigid, starting from a blank
matrix:
A dark, upflung arm hangs suspended, glisten-
ing;
A thrown spear, whistling in its arc, like a
comet.
Bristles with knots of flame and points and
violence;
An eyeball glares like a sovereign by candle-
light ;
Or a fired canoe eddies, and its prow snaps
upwards
Like the jaws of a transfixed shark.
Boyd, that morning, started off alone
With a cheerful warning to all game within
gunshot;
His blurred shape grappled with the outskirts
of the unknown;
I saw him pause a long moment, like a
swimmer,
Before the plunge into green, opaque density.
Would not that have pleased him? (unpredict-
able,
As he called himself, not to be tied down)
That his farewell appearance was not as the
half-corpse
In tangible bedclothes with an odor of crepe
and tears,
But as a shadow at the distant end
Of a tunnel of sunlight; for his last' office
A couple of shots rapped out like sharp com-
mands; , .
And a moment’s silence over the whole island.
FRANCIS WEBD.

BINGO'S BIG
CIRCUS
By
RODERICK
FINLAYSON
ONE Monday morning at the Tidal
Creek store Mr. Cummins tacks up
the posters he’s been sent by the
manager of Bingo’s Big Circus,
the Most Colossal and Sumptuous Show
South of the Line.
The posters are wonderful —six big
beauties, all colored. They show roaring
lions with fierce-whiskered men’s heads
between their jaws. They show elephants,
crocodiles, polar bears and icebergs, and
several astonishing unknown beasts circ-
ling an immense arena amid ponies carry-
ing lovely ladies and broncos with whoop-
ing cowboys. And last but not least they
show Lopella and his beautiful daughter
Stella, the Wire-walkers, the star attrac-
tion.
Lopella is a handsome athlete in a
leopard skin. He balances on one toe on
a wire hundreds of feet above ground
lightly holding aloft a cannon discharging
flame and smoke. Stella, disregarding the
cannon, one muscular pink leg extended,
arms winglike, glides gracefully toward
Lopella. She is plump and beautifully
blonde and very frisky.
The Show, it says, will present its Pan-
tagruelian Performance on Saturday at
2.30 p.m.
Friday the circus arrives and the circus’
people begin to pitch their tents in the
paddock behind the bluegums near the
hotel. You’d hardly think it the show
pictured on the posters. There are only
two caravans and a truck, the caravans
drawn by mixed teams of ponies and
horses and mules, the truck a jerky old
chugging Ford.
Mr. Cummins wants to know where are
all the lions and elephants, not to men-
tion the unknown beasts. “Oh,” says a
pert young man hammering in tentpegs,
“oh, the lions ate the other animals, and
we ate the lions, those of us what didn’t
die of starvation, when we was stranded
in the wilderness forty years. A circus is
a strange thing, boy.”
When all is fixed and the big tent up
there’s a hoop-la stall, a shooting-gallery,
a bearded lady, a line of piebald ponies
and wicked buckjumpefs, and a cage of
three sorry monkeys. But there’s no fear
of Tidal Creek’s being disappointed.
Everyone agrees it’s a bosker circus.
EARLY Saturday afternoon Uncle Ted
togs up in his tight salt-and-pepper
suit and his wide-brimmed mustard-color
hat and drives down to the settlement.
Already there’s a big crowd about the
circus tents. In saleyard rigs or blazers
or holiday frocks Maori and pakeha
babies and dodderers jostle around the
booths. At the entrance to the big tent a
band of three instruments —drum, horn
and trombone —plays bumpy tunes. The
players wear rusty green uniforms,
patched and with some of the gilt buttons
missing here and there. The drummer,
who has lost his uniform cap, won’t play
in the sun unprotected so he’s wearing
a hard-knocker hat. He glares, and bangs
out the bumpy waltz time good-oh.
After everyone has given up trying the
hoop-la, and bought great pokes of pop-
corn and sticky masses of fairyfloss, the
drum begins to bang for the start of the
show. Then there’s a rush to get in. A
man at the entrance shouts “All cushion
seats this way please, all cushion seats
this way,” and everyone shoves that way.
But it’s a have. It turns out that what the
man really is saying is “All Christian
seats this way.” It’s a catch to get folk
to fill up the tiers of narrower seats with-
out backs.
When they find out their mistake and
some begin to get indignant it’s too late
to change. And the ringmaster, looking
very handsome and grieved, holds up his
hands and says “Don’t take offence,
folks. That fool’s the clown. You can’t
blame him. Tell you what, I’ll give you
all a free ticket for best seats at our grand
monster return show.”
“Ha, ha! They won’t never see this
show back again,” laughs Uncle Ted, who
is not in a “Christian” seat.
Then the band marches into the ring
frowning everything, and in ride the
lovely circus ladies and gentlemen, and
the show’s on before anyone can turn
nasty.
There’s, no time to tell of all the events,
but the gem of the show, of course, is
the wire-walking act. Circus hands put
up the high poles and stretch the shining
wire and screw it tight till it hums. Then
in trips Stella and after her bounds
Lopella. Stella is glamorous. Her gleam-
ing white shoulders burst from her tight
bodice, her plump shapely legs appear
plumper in pink tights, her lips are bold
and red, her eyes sparkle stickily.
Sure enough, Lopella is in the leopard
skin. Muscles bulging, black hair flowing
back, white teeth gleaming savagely,
that’s Lopella.
How everyone holds his breath as the
two performers glide and pirouette,
nonchalantly at ease on the high taut
wire! What clapping, stamping and
cheering as each act swings to an end!
It’s easy to see that big bold Stella is the
favorite of Tidal Creek. The youths
whistle her, the married men clap dis-
creetly, yet lustily, and eye her sheep-
ishly. And Uncle Ted is quite carried
away.
After all the encores Stella pirouettes
bouncingly at the ringside. Her lips part
in a wide sugary smile, she opens one
eye wide and drops the other eyelid in a
naughty lingering wink —right in Uncle
Ted’s face. Uncle Ted’s cheers dry in his
throat. Around his flamipg red neck his
collar nearly chokes him. The row of
cheeky fellows just behind Uncle Ted
thump him on the back and bellow like
bulls.
The ringmaster ends the tumult by
holding up his hands for quiet. “Tonight,”
he announces, “we present an especial
attraction. The mighty Lopella, while
poised on his perilous strand, will dis-
charge a piece of artillery. Don’t miss
this monster spectacle. And need I men-
tion Stella, the darling of the Universe,
who will enthrall and dazzle and charm
you? Need I mention her? Ladies and
gentlemen, I thank you.” He bows low.
I N the horse paddock, ready to harness
' the pony and go home, Uncle Ted
suddenly stops. “By jings! ” he says, “I’ll
see the show tonight. Why shouldn’t I?
I’ll send Crummer’s boy along to milk.”
He pulls out his big silver watch. “Time
for a glass of beer and then a bite to eat,”
he says.
So he gets the pony a feed and goes to
the bar-room, where the green shutters
under the wide verandah make it cool
and dusky after the hot glare outside.
The floor is sprinkled with sawdust and
water. The woodwork is rubbed dark
with age. There’s a faint haze of tobacco
smoke, and the malty hoppy smell of
good beer.
Uncle Ted buys two drinks, on© for Joe
the barman. “Here’s health,” he says.
“I enjoy a glass now and then, Joe, but it
beats me how some fellows booze. Never
could come at that myself.”
Just then in push the young fellows
who sat behind Uncle Ted in the circus.
They’re noisy and cheeky. “Well, well,
well!” they exclaim in mock surprise.
“Here, Joe, fill pop’s glass. Drinks for
all the boys, Joe.”
“No, no,” Uncle Ted says. “Thanks,
boys, but I’m just going.”
“Oh, no” says the red-faced chap with
the spotted tie and the pink carnation in
his buttonhole. “Why! you’ll miss your
girl friend.”
“I ain’t got no girl friend,” says Uncle
Ted, laughing it off.
“Oh, you know who,” says the chap.
“Don’t know what you boys mean,”
says Uncle Ted, picking up his refilled
glass absentmindedly and gulping to hide
his sudden redness.
The others only snigger, and make
obscure remarks. They toss off their
drinks. Joe keeps their glasses filled.
Uncle Ted’s too.
“Now you boys oughtn’t to talk like
that,” Uncle Ted wags a finger at them.
“There’s the dinner gong. Just you boys
mosey along like good fellows.”
Drinks still come and go before Uncle
Ted’s dizzy gaze. He fumbles glasses and
beer slops over his suit. He graps Pink
Carnation’s arm to steady himself. “Now
boys, go home, that’s good boys. Nice
young fellers like you don’t want hang
round circus trash.”
They laugh and file out the side door,
and Uncle Ted heads happily for the
dining-room. Joe hails him. “What about
it, Ted?” He’s jerking his thumb toward
the chalked-up score of the drinks. Uncle
Ted guesses he’s got to settle it. He and
Joe pretend it’s a great joke. They wink
at each other gaily.
UNCLE TED walks with intense dignity
to the dining-room, having only a little
trouble with the swing doors. He tries
politely not to stumble against the wait-
ress. He never before noticed how pretty,
how plump she is. He bows gallantly,
finds himself beside a table, and narrowly
manages not to miss the chair. “Bring me
bit of everything, dearie,” he blurts.
Suddenly there’s a plateful of boiling-
hot soup in front Of him. And, in a twink-
ling, in crowd the noisy young fellows,
who take seats at Uncle Ted’s table.
“Halloo!” they shout. “Great to see
yon again.”
Uncle Ted looks aghast. In vain he
tries to rise and bow politely. “Thought
you boys all gone home,” he stammers.
“Oh, no /” they yell in chorus.
There’s a clatter on Uncle Ted’s other
side, and when he turns to look there’s
Stella with a flash young man at the very
next table. Again Uncle Ted struggles
to rise. Finally he bows without rising
until he finds his nose in the scalding
soup.
“Pleash to meet you,” he mumbles.
Plates of food and cups of burning
tea or coffee appear and disappear
before Uncle Ted while he tries to take
a bite of this or a sup of that before it
vanishes, and at the same time keep up
a polite, yet witty, conversation with all
around.
“Times like thish need speech,” he
cries, on his feet at last.
“Welcome to visitors to Tidal Creek!”
Cups fall and food spills.
“Oh, how cute!” Stella exclaims. “Yoo-
hoo, darling!”
“Champagne! That’s what we want,
champagne!” Uncle Ted shouts. He
beckons the waitress. “Bring out the
best, I’m paying for thish” He pulls
out his wallet and waves a handful of
banknotes. Just that morning he had got
Mr. Cummins to cash his autumn cheque.
“You naughty old thing,” Stella titters.
When the stuff they pass off as cham-
pagne comes, Uncle Ted beams on Stella.
“Here’s good luck to all, ladies and gentle-
men,” he cries.
“Coming to the show tonight, dearie?”
Stella asks. “See you later. So long,
old thing,” she drawls.
Presently Uncle Ted looks around and
Stella and her escort have vanished. He
glares suspiciously at the young men,
lurches from the table and out the door.
AT the evening performance of the
circus everyone and everything is
gayer. The loops of electric bulbs strung
from tent-poles and trees now flash red
and green, blue and white.
They jump and wink as they
sway in the breeze in and out
among the leaves. And they flutter
and flare as the old Ford engine that
pumps out the electricity goes chutter-
chug-chug. The hoop-la prizes are
gaudier, the sideshows noisier, the show-
men bolder and redder and wittier. The
band is louder and more reckless. As
if lost in this dazzling bedlam Uncle
Ted wanders in and out among swearing
circus hands and bands of Maoris who
break crayfish apart and tear out the
flesh with their strong white teeth, rolling
their dark eyes till the eyeballs flash
whitely, too.
At last everyone who has saved the
price packs into the big tent and the
show’s on. Everything goes with a swing.
The clown only has to wiggle his little
finger for the crowd to roar. Uncle Ted
sits in a hazy, but not unpleasant, dream.
Scenes change, wild animals, clowns,
horses, jugglers, come and go. Tobkcco
smoke mixes with the fumes of beer and
the reek of crayfish. Before Uncle Ted
can believe his eyes there’s Stella walking
the wire, smiling straight at him, he feels
sure. He tries to wave his fiat and croak
a snappy greeting. No one seems to
notice.
Lopella joins Stella and together they
glide through their act. Now the clown’s
handing Lopella his “piece of artillery”
---an ancient shotgun. Lopella, grinning
haughtily, balances daintily on the wire,
but Stella is waving so blatantly to Uncle
Ted that she backs with a bump right into
her partner. The gun goes off upwards
in Lopella’s hands with a crashing report
and a spurt of flame in a cloud of black
smoke. It was loaded with soot for
effect.
The soot-blackened Lopella, knocked
off balance, jitters a moment like a
rooster on a fence, totters forward and
slides down the supporting pole, where
the clown throws water from a fire-bucket
over him. People laugh, stamp, catcall
and cheer. Lopella picks himself up and
rushes out, enraged. But Stella —Stella
strolls languidly to the steps*and comes
down bowing her bold and haughty bows.
Uncle Ted doesn’t remember pushing
his way through the crowd. Suddenly
he’s outside in the cool night air, where
the colored lights still jump and the
chugging motor almost drowns the wheezy
strains of the played-out band in the
tent. Only tired and surly circus hands
and a few idlers are about.
UNCLE TED makes for Stella’s tent.
Just beyond the monkey cage, someone
had told him. Now where is it? He
pokes his head into a teht piled with
butcher meat where a bearded woman
threatens him with a chopper. He comes
face to face with the snarling blue-lipped
monkeys. They grimace and thumb their
noses at him.
Then he spies* the banner of
Lopella the Wirewalker. He lifts the
tent flap and flounders in, and there,
seated on a trunk, one leg cocked over
the other, a glass in her hand and a
cigarette between her lips, is Stella.
“What-oh!” she says. “Come on in.”
Already in, Uncle Ted stares with mes-
merised eyes at this gaudy vision of
sprawling fat limbs, leering painted face
and few cheap circus spangles.
“Nothing to say for yourself, dearie?”
drawls Stella.
With a choked cry Uncle Ted totters
toward her and tries to sit beside her on
the trunk. No room! He sags to his
knees beside her and stretches out his
arms, bumping Stella’s glass and spilling
some of the liquor down his neck.
Now Stella shows him a different mood.
“Get out, you old he-goat,” she says.
She raises one strong plump leg, plants
her foot against Uncle Ted’s chest, and

Night walks in silence down deserted
streets ;
The frosted lamps shed lonely pools of
light,
The walls hide sleep. Your phrases
poured,
You leave the grim, stone building of
your art.
Then all the words on paper that you
wrote
Dissolve from memory, and stay behind:
Some balled in wastage baskets, others
typed
In small steel letters side by side on
trays —
Impatient voices mute upon the platter
From which today’s best stories will be
served.
You to your home and bed, with work
forgotten,
While other men release the inky tongues.
And in the hours gone before you wake
The suckers will be paying twopence each
To read the who-what-where and how-
when-why
Of screaming headlines sold by corner
boys.

THE MESS-UP IN GERMANY.
(Condensed from an article b y the member of the Washington “Post” editorial staff
who toured Germany as one of a party travelling under the auspices of the U.S. War
Department.)
Germany is divided into four parts
more rigidly separated from one another
than if they were separate sovereign
States. The separation is not merely poli-
tical but economic as well. This is the
controlling fact about Germany’s future.
So long as the separation continues, no
rational economy, no recovery or rehabili-
tation is possible for the German people.
The treatment of Germany as a single
economic unit was one of the basic
assumptions of the detailed plan an-
nounced on’April 1 of this year by the
Allied Control Council in Berlin for re-
parations and the level of post-war Ger-
man economy. But every attempt to
unify the German economy has been
frustrated by the French. They insist
that a settlement of Germany’s western
frontier satisfactory to them must take
precedence. Even if French objections
should be overcome, moreover, it is con-
sidered doubtful that the Russians would
agree to effective unification. They were
willing enough to do so a few months
ago, but they have discovered now that
they can profit politically out of the Ger-
man economic anarchy.
The zonal partition of Germany was
made without consideration of economic
problems. It is said more in seriousness
than in jest that in the division the
Russians got the food, the British got the
industry, the Americans got the scenery
—and the French got the objections.
None of the zones, in any case, is
self-sustaining. And under present con-
ditions exchange of goods between them
is almost at a standstill. As a result, the
problem is not one of holding German
production down to the levels decreed by
the Allied Control Council in conformity
with the Potsdam Agreement. The prob-
lem is how to get production up to a
level which will enable the Germans to
pay for essential food and imports, and
achieve a standard of living one third
below what they had before the war
began.
Very little production is possible at
present. Opel cars, for example, are
assembled in the American zone. But
they require magnetos which are made in
the French zone and carburettors which
are made in the Russian zone. For the
manufacture of either of these, steel is
required from the British zone. Ex-
changes are effected only through the
crudest sort of bartering between zone
officials.
The development of German industry
within the limits prescribed by the Pots-
dam declaration and the Control Council
plan is essential to solution of the German
problem. The plan is a very drastic one.
In order to disarm the Germans industri-
ally, it proposes to leave them no more
than half their pre-war industrial output
and only 35 per cent, of their heavy in-
dustry ; their basic chemicals will be re-
duced to 40 per cent, of the pre-war level,
their machine-tool manufacturing to a
mere 11.4 per cent.
If they are to reach a living standard
equal to that of 1932—a living standard
which entailed mass unemployment and
thus helped to produce Adolf Hitler, and
which is the best they are now allowed
to hope for —they must increase their
peaceful production to a point which will
enable them to export three billion marks’
worth of goods in exchange for an equal
value of essential imports, food especially.
If they are not enabled to do this they
must starve or subsist on the generosity
of their conquerors. Neither alternative
is likely to foster “the .eventual recon-
struction of German political life on a
democratic basis” which the Potsdam
declaration envisages. If the German
people are to be reformed the hope of a
livable future must be held out to them.
FOOD LIBEL ON BRITAIN.
(Condensed from a London “Daily Mail" article by George Murray.)
Within the limits of its resources Britain
has done more than any other country
to stave off famine from the underfed
peoples. Britain is the only country to
have reduced her own stocks of wheat
to a dangerously low level to help
others.
By the end of this year Britain will have
sent the Germans within her zone of
occupation over 2,000,000 tons of food
of all kinds. On November 12, 1945,
112,000 tons of wheat from the United
States intended for Britain were sent to
Germany instead, and 50,000 tons of
potatoes were dispatched from surplus
stocks in Britain. On March 10, 1946, a
vessel with 10,000 tons of flour for Britain
was diverted in mid r Atlantic to Ger-
many. These facts are picked at random
from the record.
That bad conditions exist in some parts
is not to be doubted. Britain cannot pass
by on the other side —nor is she doing
so.
Lurid stories of forthcoming starva-
tion in Germany were current last
autumn. The statement of Mr. Victor
Gollancz [the London Jewish publisher]
at a meeting on October 19, 1945, that
“12,000,000 people may die of starvation
in Germany in the next few months” is
typical. On November 9, the Post-War
Economic Policy Committee of the U.S.
House of Representatives reported that
8,000,000 to 10,000,000 Germans would
die of starvation. It was stated that the
Germans were digging mass graves for
themselves well in advance of the winter,
because when that time came they would
be too feeble from malnutrition to do the
job. On September 11, it was reported:
“13,000,000 Germans will die of starva-
tion this winter if nothing is done.”
Evidently something was done —and by
Britain —for there is no evidence that any
Germans actually died of starvation.
Mr. Gollancz has quoted Miss Ellen
Wilkinson, Minister of Education, as say-
ing last October: “There is no doubt that
London ‘‘Daily Mail.”
‘‘Like to see the pretty wheat ships go
sailing past, me dear ?”
quite a number of children will die before
the winter ends because food cannot be
got to them.” But Mrs. Eleanor Roose-
velt, after a visit to Germany, said, on
February 14, 1946: “The Germans look
as well fed as, or perhaps better fed than,'
the British. The children, especially,
appear to be healthier in Germany.”
Finally, throughout March there were
stories of food riots in Hamburg. On
March 23 it was reported that 33 German
workmen collapsed from hunger. But on
March 30 the Military Government’s
public health headquarters in Hamburg
stated: “Hamburg citizens in hospital
with starvation symptoms are no more
numerous than the average for London.”
ROAD TO WORLD WAR III.
(From an editorial by David Lawrence in the “United States News.”)
World War I didn’t begin in 1914, and
World War II didn’t begin in 1939.
Examining the tragic sequence of events
we know now that when Hitler marched
into the Rhineland in 1936 and the major
Powers quibbled and procrastinated this
was the first step toward inviting war.
We know that Munich in 1938 was
just stop-gap agreement, and we know,
too, that when Hitler persuaded Molotov
and Stalin in 1939 to join him in an
alliance which enabled the Nazis promptly
to attack Poland the road to war was
opened.
Today, in this very month and year, the
steps that could bring on World War 111
are being taken. We indulge in wishful
thinking and try to make believe that
history isn’t repeating itself —but it is.
The stark fact which emerges from all
the conferences of Foreign Ministers at
Moscow, London and Paris since the end
of hostilities is that Russia has taken the
place of Germany in attempting to be the
dictator of the world’s future.
We should not be surprised at these
developments. Whenever opportunism
and expediency are substituted for prin-
ciple, there can be no faith or teliance
on the word of Governmental spokesmen.
Molotov, acting for Stalin, found it ex-
pedient to cast his lot with Hitler in 1939
and thus made possible a military offen-
sive by Hitler against Poland. Today
Russia keeps the booty she won as a
partner of Hitler—three sovereign States
in the Baltic and annexation of a third
of Poland. Today Molotov is blocking
the settlement of economic and political
questions and the signing of a peace treaty
in Europe. Today also Molotov is doing
business with dictator Peron, thus ignor-
ing the sharp denunciation of the Argen-
tinian “Fascists” which the same Molotov
expressed as he fought the admission of
Argentina at San Francisco.
The same Russian dictatorship, too, has
sent agents throughout Central and South
America—even as in Western Europe—to
intervene in the domestic politics of sov-
ereign countries by establishing Com-
munist parties which take their inspira-
tion from Moscow.
Russia is intervening in the internal
affairs of other countries around the
world from Iran to China to Chile.
Russia, when it suits her purpose, sets up
a hue and cry about “Fascism” in Spain
and does not hesitate to urge interven-
tion in the internal affairs of that country.
But when anyone suggests that Russia
herself is governed by a dictatorship more
severe than Franco’s, and that it reaches
into the satellite countries as well, there
is a quick return to the argument that
all this is the business of Russia alone.
World War II came because the other
nations of the world did not see realisti-
cally that what happened inside Germany
was a threat to the peace-loving nations
of the world. What is happening inside
Russia today is likewise a threat to the
rest of mankind. A clique or ptfrty in
Moscow, aided by a secret-police system,
keeps 180,000,000 peace-loving people
from knowing what is going on in the
outside world, from hearing broadcasts
of other countries, from reading an un-
censored press. A clique or group in
absolute command can overnight declare
war. There is no chance in Russia for
previous discussion by a Congress or Par-
liament. There is no opportunity for the
views of other peoples to penetrate the
“Iron Curtain.”
The Russians have set up political fac-
tions in France and Belgium, as well as
in Balkan and Baltic countries, to veto the
will of the majority and muddy waters
whenever it fits the Soviet purposes. It
seems incredible that, by the use of propa-
ganda and the iron hand of dictatorship,
Russia should be doing some of the very
things which the world witnessed between
1933 and 1939 as Hitler and the Nazis
built up their power of intimidation. If
it be contended that the Russians have
no such motives of world domination as
their actions indicate, then observers are
compelled to assume that the Russian
statesmen are just an inept, clumsy group
who take a sadistic delight in crossing
everybody else’s will and harassing every
country into which their agents can in-
filtrate.
Molotov knows all too well what he
wants. He is a shrewd bargainer and
trader. He wants all he can get for
Russia and is not averse to using any
means to gain his end. He stops only
when he is stopped by the adamant posi-
tion of the other major Powers, when he
realises that this may not be the time to
force a climax.
Unhappily, Russia’s record is such in
recent negotiations that it would be un-
thinkable to give her any information
about the atomic bomb. Her group of
rulers have been taking unilateral action
and saying nothing in advance about their
actions. Russia has bred distrust and sus-
picion in Europe, in the Far East, in the
Near East, in Latin America. She has
alienated American opinion so rapidly
that it seems hard to believe that less than
a year ago there was military alliance
between Russia and Britain and the
United States.
We hope fervently that moral force will
win out, and that all mankind will take
note of Russia’s obstructive tactics and
strategy of world domination. The dif-
ference between the 1936-1939 period and
the present day is that the world now is
alive to the dangers which it ignored
before.
The United States and Britain and the
other democracies of the world, therefore,
cannot disarm as yet. They would be
foolish to do so as long as any clique
or small group can overnight start a war.
Until the people of Russia have recovered
tjie reins of their own government, there
will be no assurance of peace.
The biggest enemy of world peace is
totalitarianism—the rule by a few persons
War Ingersoll Missed.
"The hangover, not the bullet, was
the most grisly hazard of most Ameri-
can officers in war-time China,” declares
Capt. Edgar C. Bundy, of U.S. Air
Corps Intelligence. “It was largely a
comic-opera war, marked by little
ground operation and scanty air attack.
It featured high commanders who braved
ulcers in a constant round of 25- to
30-course dinners of delicacies denied by
rationing to the people at home. There
was a constant round of daily and
nightly parties,” he went on. “There
were State dinners, civic celebrations,
dances, at which Chinese women were
provided for companionship. Meals
continued four or five hours wth 25 to
30 courses. The menu included roast
duck, sides of beef, filet mignon, whole
roast pigs, six or seven varieties of fish,
shrimp, which came through the Jap
lines from the coast, oysters, rare
Chinese wines, and liquor.”—Chicago

who can inflame a whole nation and
order it to war. There is no use camou-
flaging the truth about what is going on.
We are up against the ruthless rule or
totalitarianism in world diplomacy. A
Government that cannot be trusted can
make war overnight. Russian aggression
has begun. Are we on the road to World
War III? .
The answer is to be sought in Moscow.
Spurious Spanish Menace.
(As seen by “Wall-street Journal! ")
Spain is a poor country with no great
industries such as are necessary to war
production, with no oil except that which
she imports. How such a country can
start a war which would embroil the en-
tire world or how it could attack any
neighbor calls for more explanation than
the Security Council has furnished to
date.
Of course Spain will not start any war.
If any war starts it will be because some
nation or nations become embroiled over
their ambitions in Spain.
The Russian Government wants
“friendly” regimes in all European coun-
tries. In the Russian parlance a
“friendly” regime is one ruled by Com-
munists, either of the native variety,
trained in Moscow, or those which Mos-
cow sends. When such a Government is
established and when the picture of
Marshal Stalin is publicly displayed and
given due deference, then there is a
“friendly” regime. Spain is an unusually
desirable spot for such Russian opera-
tions, and the fact that Moscow once
tried there and failed is no bar to an-
other trial. The overthrow of Franco
by outside pressure must be preliminary
to that. With a Communist Spain there
would be opportunity for Communist in-
filtration into those parts of France in
which Communists have made the least
progress. A Communist France can be
used as a centre for Communism to
•spread into countries neighbors to France.
If Spain is any threat to world peace,
it is because of Russian designs on Spain.
By the nature of things Spain can have
no designs on anyone else.
The course of sentiment in Western
Europe, as shown by the Italian and
French elections, is toward a type of gov-
ernment which meets the basic standards
of democracy. It is against monarchies
and governmental machinery especially
constructed for the entrance of dictator-
ships. In due course, this sentiment will
make itself felt in Spain, if Spain is let

African invasion, a year after the U.S.
entered the war. The letter said: “Your

Franco. Sb long as there is outside inter-
ference in Spain, the position of Gen.
Franco is strengthened. Foreign Minister

Germans in Denmark.
(A comparatively—though only comparatively—
bright spot in the European displaced-persons
scene, described in a London “Times” article
by Sir William Beveridge, now Baron Beveridge
of Tuggal, with an appeal, on behalf of the
large number of children, to countries interested
in possible immigrants .)
Today there are twice as many Ger-
mans in Denmark as formed the occupy-
ing forces. But they are different Ger-
mans. They are some 210,000 old men
and boys and women and children, evacu-
ated from eastern Germany in the first
months of 1944 before the advancing
Russians. From Konigsberg and Danzig
and neighboring regions they were
bundled into ships by German authorities
and sent to Denmark.
With the liberation of Denmark, the
treatment of these German refugees be-
came a problem for the Danish Govern-
ment. They might have acted as at that
moment other Governments, in Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and elsewhere, with far
less excuse, were acting. They might have
bundled the refugees into trains or any
other form of available transport, sent
them to the German border and left them
there to their fate, or to the responsi-
bility of others. The Danish Government
realised that under the conditions of nor-
thern Germany it would be monstrous to
do this; being genuinely democratic the
Danish Government reflects the humanity
of its people. It formed camps in
different parts of Denmark, and there the
refugees from eastern Germany are kept
segregated to this day.
On our recent visit to Denmark my
wife and I went to see one of these camps
on the outskirts of Copenhagen. There,
in wooden huts erected on what was
formerly a golf course, are living some
17,000 people. Half of these are women,
nearly 37 per cent, are children under 15
years of age, and the remainder are old

PAUSE IN THE BURIAL CEREMONY.
men and boys between 15 and the age of
military service. I was told that these pro-
portions were probably typical of all the
camps. If so, the German refugee popu-
lation of Denmark today includes some
80,000 children under 15, some 105,000
women and 25,000 old men and youths.
We were told, also, that there were at least
600 lost children, whose parents could not
be found; they were being cared for
specially. , ,
The Germans in Denmark today do
not present as acute a problem of physical
want as do Germans in many other
places. They are housed and fed and
physically healthy; they are secure from
maltreatment. But the fact that their case
should not appear acute —that their exist-
ence was until recently practically un-
known in America and Britain is in it-
self an indication of how bad are condi-
tions elsewhere. For the life of the Ger-
mans in Denmark is utterly unnatural;
a life lacking in both the Darwinian in-
gredients of happiness—work and the
domestic affections; a life without free-
dom or occupation or money, just waiting
for something to turn up and bring them
release.
The problem of these Germans is one
for the four occupying Powers; it is one
facet only of the general problem of Ger-
many. It should not be wholly to the
Danes, merely because their land was in-
vaded by the Germans, and because Soviet
Russia and Poland have occupied the
former homes of the refugees.
There will remain the special problem
of the lost children. They rnust be
adopted by someone, and no nation need
fear to adopt them. If, in spite of the
past, the Danes felt able to share in this
adoption, no better assurance could be
sought that those innocent victims of
war should not grow up to be Nazis. For
the Danes are as civilised and as civilising
a people as can be found anywhere in the
world. -y

If realised, the United States of Europe
could well become one of the mightiest States
On earth. Though much smaller in area than
either Russia or the United States America*
it would comprise more than 400,000, UW
highly intelligent, energetic and even martial
people whose combined strength would be
difficult to match. That is one general objec-
tion raised against it, and to that must be
added two others which make its early realisa-
tion difficult. The first is that it would have to
include some 80,000,000 Germans, who, as the
the largest national unit, might easily gam con-
trol of the Union and thereby win in peace
what they were unable to attain in war. ine
second is undoubted opposition from Russia,
which is advancing its own unification pro-
gramme stemming from ancient imperial am-
bitions and the world-revolutionary ideas ot
Communism, and which has already brought
half of Europe under its domain. But what-
ever the objections and the obstacles, the logi-
cal necessity of greater European unification
in a world which is moving toward integration
rather than further partition is bound to give
new impetus to an ancient idea. And tne
present plight of the Continent might well
make this the only means of survival. — N.Y.

Never was the dual British interest in

equal call for a swelling flow of trade and in-
vestment and for a great expansion in the out-
put and productivity of farming everywhere.

The knee-in-the 'groin bargaining methods
with which the Russians are conducting their
“search for security” are simply creating a
world-wide sense of insecurity. To the British
and American public, to whom a war of
aggression against the U.S.S.R. is unthinkable,
Russia’s reluctance to negotiate the desired
changes in the Middle East power relationship
makes her policy look more like aggressive
expansionism than life 1 insurance. Which is it?
If it is aggressive expansionism, then strategic
concessions that would place the Soviet usffkle
Britain’s lifelines and the Middle East oilfields
would be suicidal. — “Atlantic Monthly.”

One more secret agreement entered into by

brought to light by the Russians if pressed
hard on their reparations policy. This agree-
ment is reported to have given each military
commander in an occupied area full control
over and use of every kind of property in the
area. Russians are. expected to point to this
agreement as the basis on which Manchuria
was stripped of much industrial equipment.

“ ‘it is not true that unions are dominated by the Communist party.’— Mr. Chifley. On the same day, 2500 Queensland meatworkers called off the strike begun in March,
howled down Wells, the Communist president of the Miners’ Federation, and cheered an organiser who, pointing to Communist union executives on the platform, said
‘These men have been trying to set up a Communist dictatorship.’ ” ...
“Don’t let me hear anyone singing ‘There are rats, rats, rats in the Quartermaster’s store.’ Sure and I don’t admit it.’

LARRIKINISM AND THE CURE
Forced to say something at last about
coal and strikes, Mr. McKell came out
With an issue of forcible-feeble stuff. A
party of miners from the South Coast, > a
district chiefly responsible for a produc-
tion-loss of nearly 100,000 tons of coal in
two winter weeks, had bearded him in
his den with a demand for “action on the
dust problem,” which is not “a Common-
wealth matter,” the McKell “Govern-
ment” having had the power and meafis,
if not the inclination, to deal with it
throughout its term of office, now well
into the sixth year.
Mr. McKell declared that “we are do-
ing our Best to rehabilitate industry,” and
if he had the racing “industry” in mind
the claim is conceded, though the racing
“industry” was never in any need of re-
habilitation. Referring to the deputa-
tion’s own industry, he pleaded that his
“Government” and that of Mr. Chifley
were doing their utmost for the men en-
gaged in it, and that Mr. Chifley’s “Gov-
ernment,” which has a massive and
chronic deficit —his own is rolling in easy
money, war-fruits of Canberra’s idiotic
benevolence —was ready to spend lavishly
on “amenities.” But it was “essential
that production of coal should be accele-
rated to the utmost,” and “I appeal to
you to exert your influence in achieving
this objective”:
These constant stoppages of works are
having a disastrous eiiect on the economy
of the State and the Commonwealth.
Correct as far as it goes, and as far as
it is ip the nature of a timorous “Labor”
politician to go, though a mere diagnosis
of a spreading disease, without prescrip-
tion, much less application, of a remedy.
If what happened during the first six
months of 1946 continues ; if the criminal
coal position becomes more criminal; if
Communist sabotage of industry, trans-
port, trade and commerce, checked as it
may be here and there, is not check-
mated ; if sheepmen, cattlemen and
wheatgrowers are not put in the way of
re-establishing themselves —because of
drought, high taxes, service charges and
wages and the curtailment of output
forced on them by denial of labor, mach-
inery, fuel, parts and materials, and, in
the case of Westralian farmers, by the
mad “wheat-acreage-restriction” policy,
they are far from being as solid as they
were in 1919 —there is nothing so certain
as that there will be an almighty crash.
Queensland has had a foretaste of what
may happen to the whole Common-
wealth. For upwards of four months
there was a meatworkers’ strike, con-
tinued after the Industrial Court de-
registered the union, declaring that it
had no case ; and the coalminers and the
waterside workers, though they had no
grievances of their own, joined in. One
result was that the unhappy British house-
wife was deprived of “about 35,000 tons
of Queensland meat” —Mr. Scully’s esti-
mate ; and Mr. Scully did not soothe the
feelings of graziers by recommending
them, humorlessly adapting the old “put
off the lambing” joke, to fatten up their
beasts again and kill in the spring.
The State Government declared a state
of emergency, and imposed restrictions
on cooking, lighting (prohibiting even the
lights in churches), ironing, heating,
radio and transport, hardships of
which the housewife—as in Sydney, which
has had similar experiences—was the
main victim. When the waterside workers
struck, isolated northern settlements were
placed in danger of starvation, and it
was a question whether diabetics in all
the States would not die for lack of in-
sulin, supplies for the making of which
are drawn from Queensland. As was
proved in Sydney in the summer, when
the number of deaths officially registered
rose from 1211 in January, 1945, to 1386
in January, 1946, Communist strikes can
be killer strikes.
The Government ordered a strike ballot,
but cancelled it on discovering that it was
“almost impossible to secure an accurate
and proper ballot of the rank and file of
the Meatworkers’ Union,” since “few
home addresses” had been kept. It had
discovered in the meantime that nearly all
the strikers were anxious to return to
work, but when the union delegates put
this to the Brisbane Labor Council’s
“disputes committee,” they and their sym-
pathisers were out-voted by Communists
and fellow-travellers. In the end a Gov-
ernment order to the employers—declared
guiltless by the State Industrial Court —
to reopen their works, and the union to
man them, was complied with.
At mass meetings of unionists Com-
munists —among them Wells, the general
president of the Miners’ Federation and
self-styled pupil of Stalin, who said he had
come to Queensland with £19,000 for the
financing of “disputes”—were howled
down. But while scores of thousands of
innocent people have been punished—
total loss in Queensland is reckoned at
£6,000,000 —the Communist authors of
the injuries inflicted on them and upon
their State and nation and the British
family are still at large and in a position
to plot more outrages and commit them.
What is going on in Australia is un-
controlled larrikinism, the most wicked
and dangerous form of larrikinism the
country has ever known, since it has a
foreign inspiration and purpose, hits at
whole communities and aims at placing
larrikins in supreme control.
The proved remedy for larrikinism is
law, enforced without fear or favor, as
law is enforced in Britain. It should
begin by protecting the individual worker
at the point of his job and his civil rights,
guaranteeing the exercise of his constitu-
tional right—monstrously subverted in
the Deer Park explosive factory case —
to join the union of his choice. It should
protect him against the larrikins who, be-
cause he wants to work peacefully and
lawfully in his vocation, brand him with
the hateful word “scab” and in case of
resistance threaten him with violent
assault (“put your hand up fordhe strike
or we’ll kick your guts in!”), and with
expulsion from his calling and his home
—threats which few men can stand up
against and acts which have made many
a good fellow a homeless wanderer. It
should extend the protection by vetoing
arbitrary taxes on his earnings and by re-
quiring compilers of trade-unions to fur-
nish annual and audited statements of in-
come and expenditure, with financing- of
Communist and other parties barred. And
it should arm industrial tribunals with
power to require full and precise lists and
addresses of union members, as a con-
dition of their organisation retaining
registration, and to impose drastic penal-
ties, including directions for the freezing
of union funds and the funds of sup-
porting unions, Labor Councils and the
A.C.T.U. in the event of a strike against
an award which has become the law of
the land. *
Provision for the arrest and deporta-
tion of irtimigrant agitators who start or
support illegal strikes is already on the
Statute Book. “Labor” will never apply it,
but the Opposition parties when sum-
moned to govern the country, as they will
be, are in honor and duty bound to do
so. And by invoking this neglected law
they will rid the country of many Mos-
cow agents, either by deporting them or
by relegating them to obscurity without
power to do any further mischief. It
goes without saying that the ban on
Communist organisations and publica-
tions, lifted by Dr. Evatt on conditions
which have been brazenly violated,
should be reimposed.
Armed Peace.
One reason why the first atom-bomb test
at Bikini , did not appear to come up to
expectations was that too much was ex-
pected of it. A lot of far-fetched non-
sense was published in advance and
apparently swallowed by the credulous.
Then newspaper and radio correspondents
assigned to the job felt the usual urge of
their callings to make the most of it, even
though their view was from down over
the horizon. When the thing happened,
and the earth’s foundations stood the
shock once more, the natural feeling was
one of having been let down by yet an-
other of those ballyhoo stunts.
Ballyhoo merchants are nothing if not
inconsistent. If their joss of the moment
fails their imaginings, they turn and spit
on it. It is little more than a year since
Russia was lauded and glorified above
saintliness, and what price Russia today?
Hence the bomb’s effectiveness has been
written down. This has possibly been con-
tributed to by those in charge of the
test, who are no doubt keeping secret any
results likely to be of value to a pos-
sible enemy. In the second test the
bomb, instead of being exploded
far above, is to be let off a little below
water-level, and the ships, which won’t
be wanted any more, will be grouped
closer to ensure the maximum effect.
In those circumstances there should be
enough of destructiveness for any taste.
And the more of it there is the more it
will make nonsense of the frantic urgings
of Kremlin-worshippers that all the bomb
secrets should be shared—unconditionally
—with Moscow. These urgings continue
to go up from wherever the worshippers
gather ; they have been lately heard from
humorless bunches of Australian
“scientists” and writers, coupled with
demands for the release of Nunn May.
To arrive at where that sort of advo-
cacy would really lead it is only neces-
sary to look at the performance of Russia
since the war ended. Thanks to the
occasional bursts of plain speaking by
Mr. Bevin and Mr. Byrnes, the actual
record of Russia in the so-called peace-
making is there for everybody to see and
for history to chronicle. In the mildest
terms it is a record of suspicion and
obstructiveness. What terms would have
to be used if Russia and not America-
Britain-Canada held the atom secret
should not be hard to imagine.
In all the post-war dealings up to now
Russia has brazenly acted on the correct
enough assumption that neither of the
great democracies wants war. Without
even attempt at camouflage, it has acted
on the Hitler technique of feeling out
just b*>w far it is possible to go without
provoking the others into making a
stand. The technique served Hitler very
well until he overdid it, and it has served,
and is still serving, the Kremlin even
better—at least, in the temporary acquir-
ing of territory and control of weak
adjoining countries. How the technique
would be serving with the atom bomb on
the other side of the conference table
those trying to make an accommodation
with the grumpy gentlemen from the
Kremlin have a very clear idea.
The assumption of the Kremlin-wor-
shippers—or at any rate what they pre-
tend to assume—is that, if the atom
secrets were shared, Russian suspicious-
ness (and arrogance) would instantly
vanish and the Bear would at once lie
down in peace with the Lion and the
Eagle and the rest of the menagerie. One
place where the worshippers will not sell
this charming vision is America. Even
before the Bear began its post-war clown-
ing, Americans had seen more than
enough of it in that role. All through
the war the same suspiciousness—or
whatever is the right name for it —
operated to keep Russia a closed pre-
serve. Even the war ’planes which
America—and Britain —rushed to the
saving aid of the sorely-pressed land had
to be flown in by Russian pilots.
The same suspiciousness at present
makes nonsense of the solemn labors of
Australia’s wandering Minister to bring
about U.N.O. control of the atom. The
most recent plan put forward by Dr.
Evatt started off with: “Members of U.N.O.
should undertake not to use atomic energy
in war.” The post-war record of the
Kremlin is such that only one possessed
of the solemnity of a stuffed owl could
proffer such an undertaking for signa-
ture. So with the rest of the Dr. Evatt
“plan.” It proposed an “international
authority” , vested with rights over relevant
raw materials and processes, with “effec-
tive systems to prevent breaches of agreed
restrictions.” With Americans as Well
aware as they are of the utter impossi-
bility of getting Russian agreement on any
such proposal it is really time the itinerant
Doctor came home before he makes him-
self any funnier.
The tragedy of it is that all this could
be so very different. The world, but
for the one tragic stumbling block, could
be the world of peace which is the vision
splendid of U.N.O. It could be a world
in which the peace was secured by merely
a small international force, and the vast
costs of defences everywhere could be
turned to producing better standards of
living and all high aims of civilisation.
Instead, as the New York “Times” staff
correspondent Brooks Atkinson put it
on his recent return from Moscow, the
most that can be hoped for from Russia
“is an armed peace for the next few
years.” Mr. Atkinson shrewdly put his
finger on the causes, among them “the
ignorance of Soviet leaders, very few of
whom have been outside Russia,” and
who “have developed a phobia about the
rest of the world.” In 1945, the corres-
pondent reported, the Politburo “decided
to return to the policy in which foreign
countries With capitalist economy are re-
garded as inevitable enemies”:
This obviously created inside the Soviet
Union an atmosphere in which it is easier
t for dictatorship to dominate. It is easier
to rule a people who believe that a hostile
world is organising to exterminate them.
It is also easy, as Hitler proved, to lead
such a people into war. With that facing
them, and the Russian post-war record or
arrogance and broken contracts and spy-
ing fifth columns, there is nothing prac-
tical that America and Britain can do
about it but stand up to what must be
required of them in such an armed peace.
Most evidently it is not yet a world in
which —when a mere conference table is
a setting for endless heated wrangling—
any trust can be put in such an ideal as
an international peace force. And, since
armed peace appears to be what Russia
insists on, perhaps the bigger smash the
next bomb makes at Bikini the better.
"Labor" and the "Sports."
If anyone beyond the favored circle con-
siders it anything to boast about, N. S.
Wales can claim to have 22 “Labor”
Ministers: six in Canberra, one in Lon-
don —named “Resident” because a by-
election was dreaded—and 15 in Sydney.
A People’s Referendum to decide which
are the two champion duds, one Com-
monwealth and one State, would bring an
animated response from the citizenry.
Servicemen who have to live in rooms,
garages, huts and tents would plump for
Mr. Lazzarini, the exuberant builder of
invisible homes. Farmers would show a
decided preference for Mr. Scully, who,
after paying their Westralian brethren up-
wards of a million for not growing wheat
for a hungry Europe and Asia, thought
out his grand plan for fobbing off all
wheatgrowers with less than half the
world price for the 1945-46 crop. And
all concerned in the proceedings of Mr.
O’Sullivan, the State Minister of Trans-
port, who never seems to be sure whether
there are to be more Government trams
on the roads or none at all, and who is
prohibiting mid-city parking without pro-
viding a substitute, would—“sports” ex-
cepted—choose that gentleman from
among his State colleagues as their nomi-
nation for a leather medal.
Mr. O’Sullivan has two major interests,
Rugby League football and horseracing
—as conducted by the Sydney Turf Club,
which his Government set up with Trea-
sury backing during a critical stage of
thp Japanese war, to drive the Nuffield
concern from the racecourse it bought for
a factory site and to plan another race-
course in the Lakes region—together with
a life-long interest in professional boxing
On June 21 Mr. O’Sullivan announced
the cancellation of all Sunday trams,
which was a blow to people who
go to church and visit hospitals and ceme-
teries, or take the family to parks, friends’
houses or beach suburbs. This Mr.
O’Sullivan did not mention, but he was
all there with a statement that since “a
big meeting” had been arranged for
“Rosehill,” one of the S.T.C. string of
racecourses, “special trains” would run to
that betting joint, and special trams to
the League football on the Monday—a
public holiday. In point of fact, the
special trains didn’t run. Mr. O’Sullivan
had reckoned without the feelings of the
guards, who refused to man them.
During the two ensuing week-ends there
were no Government trams in Sydney
between 2 p.m. on Saturday and Monday
morning. Racecourse and Rugby League
crowds fell away terribly. However, Mr.
O’Sullivan must have derived a modicum
of comfort from the fact that the Sydney
Turf Club did not suffer, and the conse-
quences to churchgoing people, hospital
patients and their families, those whose
pious duties take them to cemeteries and
those for whom Sunday is a day of peace-
ful recreation or reunion, don’t seem to
have disturbed him a bit.
During the fortnight without week-end
trams, production-loss of coal caused by
stoppages and “absenteeism,” the
“Labor’-controlled Coalcliff crew being
one of the principal contributors, was
reckoned at 80,000 tons. Two days of
the second July week brought more in-
famous figures ; 17,000 tons lost on Mon-
day and 13,000 tons on Tuesday. It is
winter-time, and city offices are without,
radiators and country trains without
sleepers, and railway passenger and goods
services have been ruthlessly cut. But
Mr. O’Sullivan’s mind or whatever he
chooses to call it was concentrated on
commercial sport and “sports.” And that
Monday, when tens of thousands of
honest people must have been wondering
how much longer they would be able to
draw wages, he arrived at a Great Deci-
sion (“S. M. Herald”):
A full tram service, including specials
to sporting fixtures, will be restored next
Saturday in Sydney and Newcastle. An-
nouncing this Mr. O’Sullivan said “Satur-
day tram-restrictions have caused great in-
convenience to the poorer section of the
community” and considerable loss of
revenue. Tramless Sundays will remain.
One of the Labor papers, the “Daily
Mirror,” came in with part of the ex-
planation of what had actuated Mr.
O’SulliVan without presenting it as such:
The next four race meetings in Sydney
will be S.TC. affairs, and £15,300 in prize-
money will be distributed. The fixtures
will be held at Canterbury next Saturday
and Saturday week, at Rosehill (July 27)
and Moorefield (August 3).
Another part of the explanation con-
cerns the “100 per cent. ‘Labor’ ” Rugby
League. Not only have tramless Satur-
days affected the League’s club takings
and the betting on its matches,
but its prospects have been clouded by the
poor showings of its mealtickets against
the English team. Without trams, the
last of the so-called Test matches, arranged
for the Sydney Cricket Ground on July
20, might be a dreadful financial dis-
appointment ; and the same applies to the
fights at Mr. Wren’s Stadium, which,
when trams are “off,” shows empty spaces
instead of full customers.
Under “Labor” rule, N. S. Wales is a
wonderful country for professional poli-
ticians, hard-faced persons who batten on
commercial “sport” and gamblers of
all descriptions. For housewives ana
houseless servicemen, and for the sick and
the pious, the industrious and the thrifty,
it has become another sort of country
altogether.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Working-days Lost."
British Labor took office at the end of
July, 1945. Ip the ensuing eight months,
Mr. Herbert Morrison said to the
Labor Congress, 3,000,000 working-
days were lost in “industrial dis-
putes,” and he pronounced it a
good record, far better than in the
corresponding period after the 1914-18
war. It is certainly magnificent compared
with the Australian record as dragged out
of Mr. H0110way—2,119,641 working-
days lost in 1945, the previous worst being
1,507,252 in 1940, when Communists were
sabotaging the war effort.
Though Mr. Morrison had strike statis-
tics for the first quarter of 1946, Mr.
Holloway asserted that those for Australia
were “not available.” When “available,”
whether before the general election or
afterwards, they will be horrible, and
those for the second quarter of 1946 more
horrible still.
The population of Australia is roughly
7| millions. That of Britain exceeds 48
millions. The proportion of trade-
unionists is far higher in Australia than
in Britain. According to the Common-
wealth “Quarterly Register,” the A.C.T.U.
could claim 1,218,700 subscribing mem-
bers in 1944, though with movements of
men and women out of war industries—
much greater in proportion in Australia
than in Britain, which has had to keep
ready for eventualities in Europe and
Asia —there are not nearly that many
now. The British T.U.C. total in 1944,
as given in Whitaker’s, was “over mil-
lions.” In effect, although the great
majority of Australian unionists stuck to
their work in 1945 when permitted, the
bad examples, nearly all cursed with Com-
munist control, by direct and indirect
action made average working-days
lost nearly two per head. The British
average for eight months of 1945-46
was less than half a day per head. And
the difference cannot be dissociated from
the fact that thp party of which
Mr. Herbert Morrison is a leader has,
since 1940, when the “Daily Worker”
was banned (for that Mr. Morrison was
himself responsible), taken a stern
stand against Communists, whereas Mr.
Holloway and his crowd have crawled
to them all along.
Socialised Air Transport.
The Commonwealth Department of Civil
Aviation, assuming that Australia is con-
demned to nationalised air transport
whether Australia wants it or not, is out
with a grand new plan of “decentralised
organisation,” under which Australia, its
island territories and the British islands
in the South Pacific are to be divided into
five big regional directorates, each with
a whole department to itself and giving
fealty or homage or something to a
central h.q. in Melbourne.
At least, that’s the way Melbourne
“Herald” sees it, adding that it “will mean
employment of hundreds of engineers,
architects and other professional per-
sonnel, as well as a wide variety of tech-
nicians,” and cataloguing the regions:
S.A.; Victoria; the Riverina and Tas-
mania ; the rest of N. S. Wales, Lord
Howe and Norfolk Islands; part of
Queensland south of a Rockhampton-
Cloncurry line; Westralia; the N.T. and
south to Mt. Irwin (S.A.); North Queens-
land, New Guinea, the Solomons and
islands in Australia’s region of the British
Commonwealth air plan. There is mote
about regional directors and recruitments
and transfers of officers and staffs and
training and so forth, though nowhere
is there any mention of anyone with an
aeroplane.
Australia already has a parcel of “de-
centralised” organisations for transport
by train, tram and bus, all with vast de-
partments and headquarters and directors
and commissioners and whatnot, with
Federal and State Ministers for Transport
and enough power to run an empire. But
these times nowhere in Australia can a
passenger in train, tram or bus, for long
journey or short, urgent or otherwise,
expect to be accommodated without (a)
standing in a queue for hours, ( b ) strug-
gling for a place on the vehicle and (c)
taking a long chance of ever reaching the
destination, whether the latter be merely
their work or an inter-State city or town.
That is to say, an ordinary passenger.
Politicians and Government employees
are different. One of the politicians is
already suggesting free travel for his
tribe in the socialised planes, and that is
only a step to free passages for politicians
in socialised steamers.
Lions and Asses.
“Norther” goes in for zoology:
With the meat, coal and wharf strikes over,
most of Queensland went back to work this
week, too relieved or too angry to work out
whether the Commos or the bosses or the
Premier or the “moderates” won but' dead
certain that ordinary blokes like you and me
and the missus lost, and therefore mighty
curious as to whether anybody was tobe pun
ished for the whole criminal affan:— when this
was written there was no sign of it. Mean-
time, out from Maryborough there was a 1 on
hunt on, a couple of local publicans having
offered £5O for the skin of what has variously
been described as a lion, a lioness, a big ding
and a puma. A “special reporter discovered
a fellow making bricks who desisted long
enough to assert that he’d seen it and it was
about two and a half feet high and four feet
long. It looked just like a lion. Another
witness produced the word of his wife, who
saw it “seven months ago,” and I shot at it
with a pearifle. It stopped and turned round
and looked at me.” So a party equipped with
.303’s, shotguns, shanghais, sandwiches and
beer ventured forth, and unearthed Perry
Brothers’ circus, and were shown four lionesses
“which looked just like big dingoes’—a libel
on both or maybe on the refreshments.
While this was going on there was trouble
back in the city, where the Trades Hall Disputes
Committee was invited to discuss whether or
not it would allow Winkin and Blinkin to be
loaded on the Montoro, W. and B. being a
couple of donkey mares, for the London Mis-
sionary Society’s Noru station, out from
Moresby. Nothing was said about Nod, but
presumably if he, when found, can show that
he is a member of the Transport Union and
supports the seniority rule, he’ll be allowed a
cargo sling. The society had advertised earlier
for donks, whereupon a station owner out on
the Darling offered to supply 100, plus 10,000
milch goats, and to deliver the lot at the nearest
rail siding, 400 miles away. This remarkably
generous offer had to be refused.
There was a lot of roaring or braying or
something inside Brisbane Stadium when
Commos and their dupes were gathered to-
gether and “back-to-work” motions were car-
ried. There was some bleating, too, but this
had a distant tone and was distinctly reminis-
cent of the noises that emanate from Canberra
in times like these and was ignored. There were
more roaring and braying around the Parlia-
ment House about' “a victory for arbitration,
but the genus of the creatures doing it is un-
certain, though how anybody could so describe
a 4i months’ strike —a strike which caused
untold discomfort and worry, cost many mil-

"Well, if they don't like my Macquarie-street plan, I have another. What a site
for a racecourse!"
lions in loss of production and wages and was
marked by callousness and hooliganism—with-
out being placed in the same genus as Wmkin
and Blinkin is a mystery. Queensland has
had a bellyfull of lions and asses. What it
needs now is a few samples of the genus
dinkum Australiensis to kick its noxious
species back into their holes.
"Vision"' Not So "Spiendid."
Lots of things are happening to the great
Ward-Clapp plan for standardising all
Australian mainland railway gauges which,
in “the first fine careless rapture” of its
sponsors, looked like putting the country
in for £230,000,000. When the balloon
first went up all the “Labor” Premiers
dutifully cheered, but the non-“ Labor
Playford somewhat mordantly remarked
that he didn’t expect the first sod to be
turned for at least seven years and he
wasn’t going to hold his own railway
plans for that length of tiipe.
Then the other Premiers fell silent and
thought hard, and presently there came
noises of dissent out of Westralia and
Queensland. In Sydney, moreover, the
McKells, having suddenly discovered an
Eastern Suburbs railway plan to cost
£25,000,000, seemed rather pensive.
Meantime the service chiefs announced
that the Ward-Clapp plan was by no
means essential to defence and Mr. Clapp
himself, possibly a little alarmed over the
continued harping on that £230,000,000,
reminded everybody that the “A,” “B
and “C” proposals in his report to Mr.
Ward envisaged a cost of “only
£76,751,000, though there was another
little matter of £15,000,000 or so for
“associated works not chargeable to the
standardisation project.” Then sundry
large aircraft began demonstrating in
Australia, as they had done on a
much larger scale in Burma and othei
countries, what they could do with
passengers and freight over long dis-
tances. In the background, waiting
to emerge refreshed and revitalised
from war service, there was a great road
transport industry to which distance or
load means nothing and which is not sub-
ject to the caprices of Communist-led
coalminers.
These and other influences had their
effect on the Premiers when Mr. Ward
met them in Sydney early in May. Just
what was said isn’t known, but it was
announced that the conference had
“failed to agree” and Mr. Ward was
very wild about it. Westralia and
Queensland had dug their toes in even
more firmly. Now it seems that the N. S.
Wales, Victorian and South Australian
Governments have reached a “broad
agreement” with Canberra. By virtue
of the broad agreement there is to be
conversion to standard gauge of the Port
Augusta-Alice Springs line, with a pro-
mised extension to Darwin ; what is more,
Victoria and S.A. broad-gauge lines are
to be converted to standard gauge and a
standard-gauge line is to run from Pirie
to Broken Hill.
All this is expected to bring the cost
down to about £51,000,000. The Com-
monwealth is to find £20,000,000, Vic.
£15,000,000, S.A. £6,000,000 and N.S.W.
£lo,ooo,ooo—this last because, though
N. S. Wales will have little or no conver-
sion to do, it may “expect to benefit from
the work.” If it all comes off Australia
will have two instead of three main
gauges —4ft. in N.S.W., Victoria and
S.A., 3ft. 6in."in Westralia (except from
Kalgoorlie to the S.A. border) and
Queensland.
On his return to Adelaide from the
Canberra meetings, Premier Playford
hailed the arrangement as “complete
agreement”; and, barring obstacles
and accidents, it will mean fulfil-
ment at last of the 35-years-old Com-
monwealth promise of a Darwin-
Adelaide line. But the S.A. Minister for
Railways presently announced that con-
version to broad gauge of his State s
narrow-gauge lines in the south-east
would “proceed as planned, as it would
probably be some years before the unifica-
tion plan could be linked up.”
Possibly the South Australians; like a
lot of other people, are beginning to
regard the Ward-Clapp scheme as a.
political counterpart of Lewis Carroll’s
Cheshire cat, which faded away until
only the grin was left, and even that dis-
appeared.
Making Ned Kellys.
“Pawang” writes in anger:
A visitor from Mars who rtiade a cursory
inspection of the headlines in Melbourne dailies
last week would have gathered the impression
that a new war had broken out.
It all happened in the foothills. One Edward
Charles Davis, a young man who had been
living with a doctor’s family at Olinda, was
wanted for “plundering” houses. In a tew
days the police search developed in the papers
into a manhunt.
The incipient Ned Kelly was described as
living in hollow logs or up trees and sneaking
around in dense scrub, armed to the teeth
and displaying a “defiant and sullen appear-
ance Outdoing its morning contemporaries in
hysteria, the “Herald” announced that the
“bandit” had “extended his operations to Kalo-
rama,” while hordes of cops were “operating
from secret headquarters on a mountaintop out-
side Olinda.” A map accompanied this alarm-
ing intelligence, which would have done more
than justice to a major campaign in the Western
Desert. Police with pistols, service rifles and
tommy-guns were depicted inviting the des-
perado to “come out Or we shoot from a
hiding-place where he wasn’t, and all the jargon
of the war correspondent was revived to con-
jure up in the public mind a picture ot a
countryside suffering under a reign Of terror
being protected by heroic Johns determined,
as Davis is, to shoot it out.”
After “swift work” by the Drouin and
Warragul police the man was .found, dirty
and unkempt and obviously bewildered, walk-
ing along a public highway. Unfortunately
for the papers, he offered no resistance to
arrest. There was the usual press photo-
grapher on the spot to take a photo, of an
individual who looked about as dangerous as
a season-ticket holder.
Then it turned out that Davis was neither
a killer nor a madman. He is a neurotic
needing psychological treatment. For years he
had been the patient of a local doctor who
treated him with understanding, allowed him
t'o mix with the family and had no trouble
with him whatever. His latest protector be-
fore the manhunt started was Dr. Rae W.
Dungan, of Collins-street, who employed him
on his farm at Olinda.
“This man is not a desperate criminal, said
Dr. Dungan. “He is a faithful worker, and a
kindly man; kind to children and to animals.
I know his medical history well. The poor
fellow became mentally sick just before Easter.
We sent him away for a holiday, but the guest-
house would not have him and he became upset.
All the information that has been published
about him gives only one side of the picture.
Too much can be made of his petty larcenies.
He only wanted food. I trust him with my keys
and he has never betrayed my trust, and when
he entered my home he left it as he found it,
and even washed up the dishes after him. Con-
sider how easily he was captured previously at
Brunswick. When he ran and the police fired
shots, he said ‘You had better shoot me, any-
way.’ Do they sound like the words of a
desperate criminal or of a sick man?”
Part of the aftermath of the most violent
war in history is a growing interest in violence
which a sensation-mongering press does every-
thing in its power to foster. If either of the
two doctors who knew this unfortunate creature
had been called in he could have led him in on
the end of a piece of cotton.
"Blame Nuffield!"
Lord Nuffield started it all, when he first
considered putting a motor factory on
Victoria Park racecourse. The plan fell
through because Mr. McKell didn’t send
a telegram or the Sydney Turf Club
sought to retain the right to graze ferrets
there or something, but the damage had
been done by that time. Then Mr.
McKell came out with his scheme for
knocking down the Sydney Hospital (to-
gether with the Barracks and the Mint),
and re-erecting it on Kensington race-
course, subject to the approval of the
Sydney Turf Club. The Sydney Turf Club
caught the craze and seized the Lakes
and Eastlakes golf courses for a race-
course site. With the Lord Mayor dis-
posing of the Council’s pubs and theatres
things really got under way.
It was rather a shock when the N.S.W.
Rugby League squatted on Randwick
racecourse, but the A.J.C. soon recovered
and staged its spring meeting at the
Stadium, and made arrangements to take
over Rookwood Cemetery for the follow-
ing season. In self-defence the under-
takers tried to stake claims in Hyde Park,
but the Housing Commission had got in
first, and they were forced to content
themselves with the Sydney Cricket
Ground. The Cricket Association took it
in good part, made arrangements for the
next English team to play at the Home-
bush Abattoirs and extracted a promise
that none but bona fide members should
be interred in the Members’ Stand.
After that things speeded up. Central
Station was taken over by the Luna Park
people and the McKellys rushed through
a bill diverting all trains to the Zoo. This
caused a little inconvenience, but as there
wasp’t any coal for them to run on any-
way, things weren’t as bad as they might
have been. There was a bit of fuss made
at first when the Zoo authorities fenced
off Martin Place and transferred their
animals there, but Sydney people by this
time were getting used to anything, and
they were not at all surprised when the
Council of Churches held its annual con-
ference at Tooth’s Brewery, forcing the
beer-makers to shift their plant into the
Central Methodist Mission.
The gaiety of the morning when the
Housewives Association descended upon
the Union Club was unfortunately marred
by the death of two old members from
apoplexy, but their colleagues were too
busy shifting their possessions to the
Trades Hall to waste time repining. The
hall was vacant at the time, as the inmates
had just moved into the Art Gallery.
After that things began to get out of
hand. Pilots were mooring oversea
steamers on Mascot aerodrome and fly-
ing boats were holding up traffic in
George-street. “S. M. Herald” came out
with a Communist supplement and the
“Tribune” printed a slashing attack on
Uncle Joe, and no one noticed anything
incongruous in either occurrence. It
seemed that Sydney citizens had sunk into
such a deep apathy that nothing could
surprise or arouse them.
But there is a limit in all things and
one morning the awakening came. Pas-
sengers on the only remaining ferryboat
noticed two men with strong Victorian
accents unscrewing the Harbor Bridge.
The news spread like wildfire. Crowds
stormed Parliament House (temporarily
located at the Glaciarium —lads from the
Gosford Boys’ Home had taken over the
Macquarie-street building) and forced the
Government to take action. The Mc-
Kellys rushed through a Back to Normal
Bill, giving everyone 24 hours to get back
to their own backyards and the Victorian
saboteurs 25 minutes to get back to their
own State. It worked!
But now the whole thing seems to be
starting over again. Mr. McKell is talk-
ing of moving Sydney Hospital to Ken-
sington racecourse ; the Sydney Turf Club
speaks of taking over two golf courses,
the Lord Mayor wants to sell the
Council’s pubs. If history repeats itself
Lord Nuffield will be to blame.

CARRERAS LTD.——OVER 150 YEARS' REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
Saying he would ne’er consent to
income-tax reductions Chifley has con-
sented to them. For wage- and salary-
earners, though calculated “as from”
July 1, they are not to take effect till
“about the beginning of September,”
September being the election month. So
pay-as-you-go, in respect of tax actually
chargeable, is in the meantime to become
pay-more-as-you-go.
As a prelude to Chifley’s announcement
of his delayed-action tax-cuts, Menzies
said in Melbourne that “with the present
high taxation no one can make a large
net income unless he is a crook.” Judging
by the current craze for ostentation in
dinner-dance joints and for wagering large
sums in cash, there are a good many
crooks about.
Listeners to the debates at Canberra
learned for the first time how easy it is
for a worthy member to be suspended.
Objecting to Forde making a Ministerial
statement when answering a question—-
a sore point with the Opposition
Tommy White, the member for Bala-
clava (Vic.), was accused by the Speaker,
Rosevear, of “keeping up a barrage of
interjections.” Tommy replied “If that
is intended for listeners it is untrue.”
He refused a demand for a withdrawal
and an apology and was “named” and
suspended for a week. “I bow to the
decision of Rafferty,” the suspended one
said, whereupon the Speaker said “I will
deal with the hon. member next week.”
It is possible that his right to do so will
be challenged on constitutional grounds.
From an account of the San Francisco
conference, published in “United Nations
Primer” by one Sigrid Arne, a great
admirer of Dr. Evatt, “the leader of the
small Powers”:
The United States... .was determined to
gain the admission of Argentina. Russia
was just as determined both to oppose
Argentina and to gain admission for
Poland. Molotov took that Argentina
argument both to a big press conference
and into a public-conference session. The
vote on Argentina’s admission was taken
immediately and Molotov lost.
A Buenos Aires sequel, just over a
twelvemonth later (United Press):
When Argentina and Russia renewed dip-
l<pmatic relations after 29 years, Konstan-
tin Shevelev drew cheers from a gathering
of Argentine Senators and Deputies. He
put a Peronist button in his lapel and
drank a toast to Argentine sovereignty,
against' imperialism and to Soviet-Argentine
friendship. Those present responded with
cheers for the Soviet Union, the Red Army
and Stalin.
No mention of Franco being a party to
the congratulations; but no doubt his
opportunity will come.
A fact brought out by the broadcast-
ing of debates is that Daly, the young
man from Martin, has taken Forde as his
model. Though his vocabulary is not so
copious, he has the same oily style and
excessive anxiety to please and gives the
same impression of washing his hands
with invisible soap in imperceptible water.
The engaging youth is unlikely to have
many more opportunities of studying the
Master. He got in for the first and
only time because the Opposition fool-
ishly gave another nomination to the ex-
ploded McCall, and because there were
nine other candidates, all of whom lost
their deposits.
The loan to Britain is through Con-
gress. Its prospects looked bleak when
the extreme Zionist organisations cam-
paigned against it, but they overdid the
business, as extremists are apt to do. Not
satisfied with attacking Britain in the
language they applied to Hitler, they
issued a “Kill that Loan” instruction to
Congressmen, placing a number of those
worthies in the position of having to
Support the loan to avoid having to
appear before their constituents as being
under Jewish orders.
Thomas George de Largie D’Alton,
Tasmanian Minister of Forests, 1939-43
(and Commonwealth High Commissioner
to N.Z., 1943-46), is to stand his trial on
two charges of corruption. Also named
in the indictment, which was filed by the
State Solicitor-General, are Edvard
Aarstad Alstergren and William George
Nosworthy, of Victoria, and Ronald
James Howard, of Tasmania —all in the
timber trade.
Victoria has and has had Labor
Assemblymen who are not scared of Com-
munists. It lost one when Cain’s deputy,
H. M. Cremean, died just before he
would have beome a Minister, and an-
other when Mullens, of Footscray, gave
way to Holland when Footscray and
Flemingtpn were amalgamated. The new
challenger, S. M. Keon (Richmond), is
ready to take on anybody, especially
Thornton and Flanagan, whose Red
Racket started a strike in Nobel’s which
could “tie up every industry in Australia”
because Lloyd, president of the Arms, Ex-
plosive and Munition Workers, and other
members of that union employed in
Nobel’s refused to join the Racket. “Poor
old Holloway” sided with the Racket,
and Keon, pointing out that Lloyd was a
member of the A-L.P., said Holloway was
crawling for immunity from Communist
opposition in his constituency. Though
Communists are threatening to drive Keon
out of his party and electorate, the young
man—he is a new member—is standing
firm and getting strong support.
Tas. Senator McKenna (now Minister
of Health and Social Services) to Tas.
Senator Sampson in reply to a series of
questions:
The Honorable Thomas George de Largie
D’Alton was appointed High Commissioner
for Australia in New Zealand on Decem-
ber 15, 1943. The term of the appointment
was for the duration of hostilities and six
months thereafter. Mr. D’Alton’s term of
office therefore expired on March 2, 1946.
McKenna did not explain why this in-
formation was not given to the public in
March instead of having to be dragged
out of his Government nearly four
months later.
Having got rid of Lord Nuffield,
McKell’s Turf Club is dabbling with the
notion of “resuming” a great area of
public lands, now under Sydney Water
Board control, on which to build a
greater and grander Randwick. The
area lies between Kensington and Mascot,
is a natural water catchment of lakes and
creeks from which valuable industries
draw essential soft water, includes two
golf courses and is used by thousands
of people for games, walks, bathing and
picnics throughout the year. In the
spring, when the gorse and heath and
acacias that clothe the hills are in bloom,
there is a riot of beauty there. A declared
bird sanctuary, it is the home of thou-
sands of wild duck, coots, swans, cranes,
egrets, snipe in their season and wandering
ibis from the west. On any sunny day
the bird clamor arising from the reed
beds and marshes is a delight to ears
weary of city noise. And it is in the
heart of an industrial area, surrounded
by workers’ homes. The very thought
of turning it into a racecourse is horn ole
except to “Labor” and the “sports.”
A couple of months ago Forde was
heard bleating that Australia’s target of
120,000 tons of meat for Britain this year
would be achieved. Last week it fell to
Scully to announce that the Queensland
meat strike would cost the hungry British
35,000 tons of meat. Then he added the
priceless rider that the Queensland killing
season would be extended to September
or October to get about 10,000 tons to
help make up the deficit. Any time now
Scully can be expected to produce a
scheme to postpone the egg-laying season
if the autumn is too severe or put off the
honey-flow in beehives till the bees are
registered or something.
A note from Darwin:
Presumably as a result of the spirited pro-
tests of the Anglican Bishop, the Anglican
Church has had its rectory returned to it, and
Anglicans can now worship at their own
church with no fear of its being closed to
them. But the Catholic Bishop, taking his
stand on the constitutional guarantee (section
116) of “the full exercise of religion,” refuses
to accept a leasehold substitute for acres of
freehold on which his church has “all its in-
stitutions, church presbytery, convent school
and orphanage.” Bishop Gsell is now in Syd-
ney, and the matter may go to the High Court
and possibly the Privy Council.
A question fired at Chifley every few
days is “When does the Minister of Ex-
ternal Affairs propose to visit Australia?”
One reply was that the wandering boy
would “attend the early sessions of the
Peace Conference, which are expected to
begin about July 29, and return in time
for the election and referendum cam-
paign.” It will be harrowing if he has to
choose between the Peace Conference and
the referendum campaign, but Caucus
may come to his rescue by killing the
referendum.
Worthy support for the loan to Britain
came from Cordell Hull—very old and
near his end —and from high-minded Jews
like Sol Bloom, chairman of the House
Foreign Relations Committee, who said
he would “vote for it without hate.”
Bloom was bom in Victoria, like Isaac
Isaacs, who, in his extreme old age, has
contended valiantly, as a patriotic Aus-
tralian of the Jewish faith, against the
doctrine that the Jew is a homeless exile,
robbed of his heritage by the British.
For this he has been bitterly attacked by
Johnny-come-latelys like Professor Stone
and Rabbi Schenk —at a meeting of Syd-
ney Zionists last week “the crowd hissed
and jeered every time his name was men-
tioned,” and cheered when Mr. Schenk
• —who came from New York in 1939 at
the age of 34 —described him as “a lone
wolf,” who spoke “for himself and others
in his patch.”
In a very unusual despatch from Lon-
don, Gordon Gilmour, of the Sydney
“Sun,” applied the term “outright lying”
to a Jewish Agency report that Tommies
in Palestine “dragged old people by the
hair, beat, children, crippled people for
life, forcibly administered enemas and
committed acts even more bestial”:
S9me people reading it wondered whether
Jewish reports of German terrorism had
been equally well founded.
The same people must wonder, as do
others, whether Zionists blame the
British for the well-authenticated mas-
sacres of Jews in Communist Poland,
where Russian troops still abound.
From the first speech of Governdr-
General Freyberg, V.C., to the Parliament
at Wellington:
The housing of ex-servicemen is a matter
of special concern to my Government, and
considerable progress has been made, de-
spite shortages of building materials and
labor. Some 16,000 ex-servicemen have
been housed already, not only in State
rental dwellings but in houses built or
purchased by ex-servicemen with rehabili-
tation loans.
This puts it up to Lazzarini to say how
many Australian ex-servicemen his crowd
has housed. He won’t.
A Labor P.M. at a meeting of coal-
miners :
The next election will prove a Waterloo
for either Lab’or or the Opposition, and
there is a grave danger that Labor may be
put out. Continuation of the coal shortage
will damage its chances.... The miners
gave a pledge to produce more coal and
eliminate stoppages.
Fraser, of course, not Chifley. Though
there are coalminers in Chifley’s electo-
rate he has never been known to address
them as P.M., much less ask for a more-
coal-and-no-stoppages pledge from, them.
Yet the district output is down 40,000
tons on output for the corresponding
period of 1945 —a disgraceful year.
In a thoughtful and dispassionate
lecture on “Causes of Industrial Un-
rest,” Holt, ,M.fLR., quoted the dead
but unforgotten H. B. Higgins, member
of the first Commonwealth Labor Gov-
ernment and president of the first Com-
monweal Ih Arbitration Court:
There should be no more necessity for
strikes and stoppages in order to obtain just
working conditions than there was need for
the Chinaman of Charles Lamh to burn the
house down whenever he wanted roast pork.
The arbitration system is devised to pro-
vide a substitute for strikes and stoppages,
to secure the reign of justice as against
violence, of right as against might—to sub-
due Prussianism in industrial matters.
With “Communism” substituted for
“Prussianism” it is as true now as when
Higgins wrote it. But time has imparted
a deadful irony to the title of his book;
A New Province for Law and Order.
The Queensland strikes brought shocks
to some motorists. The innocent fellows
supposed that, driving along their own
roads in their own cars, on which they
had paid registration and insurance, they
could give a lift to a friend going in the
same direction. It cost them fines rang-
ing from £2 to £l5, though there were
no trains or trams. Their offence was that
they had no “special licence or permit.”
Shortage of timber —which will con-
tinue for more years than timbermen like
to think.about—and especially of furni-
ture timbers is causing a tremendous
demand for Queensland silky oak. Mills
in the north are chock-full of orders and
buyers aren’t concerned how it comes or
whence. Queenslanders are anxious about
it, and want protection against denuda-
tion of the stands and provision for re-
placement of cut trees. So far, there’s a
dead silence from forestry authorities.
The “tapering rate” for freight on State
railways provides for a lower rate per
ton-mile the further the freight is carried.
But it stops at State borders. This, of
course, is a deliberate method to draw
freight to capital cities irrespective of the
natural port. Attempts have been made
to have it operate from loading point to
destination irrespective of borders, but
since N. S. Wales, for instance, would thus
lose freight to Melbourne and Brisbane
because the haul would be shorter, the
reform awaits fulfilment. When road
transport, which ignores borders, arrived,
State politicians lost no time in clapping
heavy taxes and restrictive legislation on
it. And they keep on telling the world
how progressive we are!
As tough as Federal “Labor’s” income
tax in its bearing on the small house-
holder is N.S.W. State “Labor’s” tax on
house insurance in the form of stamp
duty. It is levied at the rate of 6d. in the
£lOO of cover or any part of it, and even
on a premium of 18s. it works out at ss.
Still McGirr, the No-Housing Minister,
may claim that there will be few addi-
tions to the list of the skinned for years
and years and years.
The Queensland troubles resulted in
the northern State being rediscovered
by the Sydney daily press. In these
days of air travel, radio communi-
cation and a continent made conscious of
itself as a whole by war and subsequent
troubles it is strange but true that no
place more than 50 miles from Sydney
and its outer suburbs of Newcastle and
Wollongong can get itself into the Sydney
dailies unless it has a gory murder, a
Premier who stands firm against disrup-
tionists or a young female capable of
winning a beauty competition in the mini-
mum of clothing.
It is queer that the Russians should be
so greedy for Persian and European oil
when they have had a standing claim to
the possession of 52 p.c. of the world’s
known oil-bearing resources in their own
territories. American oil experts are con-
vinced that the explanation lies, to a
great extent, in bad Russian production
methods. The Russkis grabbed 143
American oil wells in south-west Hungary,
and “ruined” the best by trying to in-
crease the flow. Their clumsy operations
left “20 p.c. of potential yield in the
ground,” and did damage reckoned at
25,000,000 dollars. In the process they
“wasted enough gas daily to supply Buda-
pest for a week.”


THERE’S A PEACE CONFERENCE COMING ON...


Society
AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS
“Uco”: During the first broadcast of
Federal Parliament, Army Minister Forde
replied to questions regarding Australian
troops at Morotai and Gibraltar. He
didn’t say much, but he used the word
“personnel” at least eight times. Apart
from “implementation” I consider this
one of the ugliest words brought into
general usage by the war. As an ex-
member of that branch of the country’s
forces that Mr. Forde has the honor of
controlling, I realise that the word has its
legitimate place in the language, but I
object to the use of such a stilted term
when “troops,” “men” or “soldiers” would
be the more suitable word. The most
ridiculous example of its employment in
my experience occurred on a troopship
returning from New Guinea, when a
harassed young loot wishing to clear por-
tion of the vessel’s deck called out to
a crowd of us, “All you personnel
come away from that rail!” There was
no response. No self-respecting soldier
would obey such an order. Realising his
blue, the loot amended it to “Come on,
chaps, clear the rail,” with much better
results.
“Listening Insect”: I have no objec-
tion to members of Parliament having
their wisdom broadcast; in fact, I like
it. But I should like to see the appoint-
ment of a Logician-General who would
accompany the broadcasts of debates
in the manner of the Auditor-General—
except in point of time—when he analyses
the accounts of the nation. My L.-G.
would give a running commentary
showing where the member violated
the principles of implication, legiti-
mate inference, induction, verifica-
tion and the various forms of
syllogism into which every argument must
fit if it is to be valid. As these are
broken by every politician almost every
time he opens his mouth, the results
should be amusing and educative.
“Bo” takes an inaugural earbashing:
A split second after the Amen to the Lord’s
Prayer, which was intoned in a Sabbatical,
meditative calm, I almost leaped in the air as
an uproar comparable only to that let loose
at the suburban picture show on Saturday after-
noon when Frankenstein and the Mad Doctor
come to grips hit the battery of mikes.
This gradually simmered down to a steady noise
like Niagara in flood, until the first question
without notice was asked. Simultaneously came
a sepulchral cough, followed closely by a bron-
chial honk and an asthmatical wheeze. This
seemed to be the signal for a symphony of
barks and sniffs, hawkings, squawkings, blow-
ings and snuffings. “Schnozzle” Calwell’s
humorless voice rose above the laryngeal salvos
and Opposition snipings in an obviously
cooked-up effort to get some party hate off his
chest. A Mr. Daly, who appeared to be hold-
ing a mouthful of lin. tacks, spoke of some-
thing “in pertickler” which turned out to be
nothing in pertickler except “set-ups,” which
word he used six or seven times for lack of an
alternative one. Tommy White used a voice
almost as good as the late Leslie Howard’s.
“Capricornia” Frankie was a double turn-up for
the books: he didn’t call for a report (though
he did promise to ascertain some circumstances
or something), and his voice came over the
air with quite a ring to it. The venerable Billy
r-r-rolled his r-r-rs, delivered his speech with
incisiveness and precision and had a terrific
battle with that awful botch of a word “tele-
communications.” Speaker Rosevear’s voice
was dignified and pleasant to the ear; Prime
Minister Chifley’s replies to various honorable
members embodied calmness and an apprecia-
tion of the high art of sidestepping. Interjec-
tions were mostly in the boneheaded class, with
wit at a premium. Yet, even though some of
the stuff that came over was enough to give
the mikes a permanent kink in the cord, the
Commonwealth Parliament’s first broadcast
proved on the whole better entertainment than
most listeners hoped for. But if only the
C.S.I.R. could evolve some method of con-
verting all the emitted “ers” and “hems” into
fuel Australia could snap its fingers at the
strike-mad ratbags of the N.S.W. coalfields.

“Cauboy”: Melbourne’s extraordinary
marathon of music is beginning to have
its repercussions. The dailies as a rule
have only one musical critic, and the poor
fellow may have to duck in and otit of
three or four concerts in an evening.
Bernard Heinze and the Symphony
Orchestra must have been surprised the
other Saturday morning to learn on the
authority of a Great Daily that, before
playing Elgar’s ’cello concerto in E Minor
with soloist Kurtz, and a Theme and
Variations by Tschaikowsky, they had
played the Mozart Symphony in C Major
and the Symphony No. 5 of Shostako-
vich, the latter being given “a very well-
balanced performance.” The ignorant
fellows thought they had performed the
Bach-Weiner Toccata in C Major and
Beethoven’s Symphony No. 4. During a
previous glut of music one critic left half-
way through a programme by a very
famous piano-thumper. His paper next
morning displayed a very appreciative
“Remember when you and Bloggsy ‘went through' on a crook
leave pass ?”
notice, the only item selected for adverse
comment being a piece that hadn’t been
played—there had been a switch in the
programme.

“The Falcon”: As if in acknowledg-
ment of his equine and feathered cobbers,
recently saved from death by humans (B.
10/7/’46), an Alsatian dog saved his
youthful master from drowning in the
Nepean River, Penrith (N.S.W.). When
the two-year old kiddie fell from the
bank the dog rushed about barking
loudly, dashing backwards and forwards,
until he attracted the attention of a passer-
by, then plunged into the river and re-
appeared with a tiny cap in his jaws.
His curiosity aroused, the dog’s audience
ran across, saw the boy floating face-
downwards, dived in and dragged him
out. After oxygen treatment the young-
ster recovered.

“Bennie”: We queued up at the
grocer’s; tobacco supplies had reached
our northern town. Three deep at the
counter, we watched the manager open
the box which was supposed to hold our
precious weed. He tipped the contents
on the counter, a note: “Hope you won’t
need a smoke as much as we did! ” One
and all we cursed that wharfie, that sea-
man or that railwayman.
* * * *
“Ad Rem”: American medicine’s
latest wonder-drug, streptomycin, exploits
Florey’s development of penicillin. The
Yanks are working on the theory of the
Frenchman, Dubos, who established that
all vegetable and animal matter disin-
tegrates when left long enough in, or on,
earth, owing to the action of organisms
in the soil, many of which yield up cura-
tive substances which may change ’ the
whole story of healing. What we recog-
nise as mould or a state of decay is simply
a stage of this micro-organic disintegra-
tion. And no doubt Binghi will go on
slapping mud-poultices on his wounds as
he has done down the ages.
* * * *
“Stanus”: Bogus R.A.A.F. officers (B.
2616/’46) were often detected through
very elementary mistakes. A wing-com-
mander who made a big impression at a
fashionable Sydney hotel, and could talk
fluently on Middle East and European
operations without betraying himself, had
a very short run. His very impressive row
of decorations sandwiched campaign
colors between two D.F.C. ribbons. . He
was easy meat for a corporal S.P.
=i= * * *
“Gumleaf”: The day before the atom-
bomb test three weary, shivering people
alighted from a car in front of the Oberon
(N.S.W.) pub. Asked by a helpful local
why they had come up to Oberon in mid-
winter, one replied through chattering
teeth, “It’s in case the tidal-wave hits
Sydney!”
* * * *
“Jurumudi”: I see that an experimental
batch of 400 half-day-old chicks has
gone to Singapore per Qantas. I
hope they succeed and I trust a good chef
will be sent to instruct the native cook
how to prepare the humble ayam for
the table. The native product, through
interbreeding, has become a miserable,
stringy, tasteless creature not much bigger
than a pigeon, and in my time was the
gastronomical joke of Malaya. Its only
virtue was its price, which ranged around
sixpence. Returning to Australia after
suffering it three times a day for years,
the Singaporean shows no enthusiasm
when he is invited to dinner and served
•with chicken, even if it did cost his host
the best part of 20 shillings.
* * * *
“Findy”: Abused and overworked
words (“Zake,” B. 10/7/’46)? .“Popular”
certainly gets a hiding at the hands of
daily paper scribes, but my vote and sym-
pathy go to “dramatic.” I’m prepared
to concede that when Comrade Gromyko
stalked out of the U.N.O. Council-room
a few months ago there were elements of
drama in the situation, but I can see
nothing dramatic in a jockey’s refusal of
a mount or of an owner’s decision to
scratch his nag from a race. When the
poster of an afternoon paper screams
“Murder Case —Dramatic Developments”
I know that it merely means that a police-
man has found an old pair of boots or
that a witness has testified that he knows
nothing of the accused, the victim or any-
thing. “Dramatic Announcement by
Minister” leaves me unmoved —he’s
merely stated that coal stocks are lower
than ever and that there’ll be restrictions
on light and power; and he’s been ex-
pected to say it for days, anyway. And
the Prime Minister’s tax-reduction act
may be a good impersonation of a fairy
godfather, a neat execution of a con-
juring trick or just a little bit of pre-
election window-dressing, but it certainly
isn’t drama.
* * * *
“Morehead”: One would think that a
picture of the symbolic figure of Justice
—a blindfold female clad in classical
drapery, holding a sword in her right-
hand and a pair of scales in her left —
could be picked up easily enough. Yet
when some military high-ups wanted one
as a design for a shield a lieutenant , and
a sergeant canvassed newspaper offices,
bookshops, libraries and lawyers for two
days without result. They rang up Judges,
magistrates and police officials, and
toured city and suburban court-houses
armed with a camera. Finally they un-
earthed a print used as a frontispiece to a
book of legal memoirs. Strange that so
familiar a figure should be so elusive.
Stranger still that those who wanted it
didn’t commission an artist.
“Eve”: I suppose we asked for it. We
were staying at Katoomba (N.S.W.)andwe
caught the morning bus to Lithgow. A
schoolboy about 10 looked so disgusted
with things in general that we were
prompted to speak to him. No reply. A
sixpence slipped into his coat pocket
thawed the awful ice a little. But it was
a good old bull’s-eye which really did
the trick. After inquiring about his
school, pets and recreations, we
got to the usual question, “And
what would you like to be when you
grow up?” The kid looked at us slowly
and scornfully. Then, with deliberate
malice, he said, “I’m not going to be any-
thing important—l’m just going to be a
tourist.”
* * * *
“Clooter”: I see where the N.S.W.
Liberals have decided to arouse public
opinion Or oust apathy or something, and
I can only say they’ve got the job in front
of them —at least, so far as the cities are
concerned. Any amount of people will
loudly decry the present state of affairs,
but anyone who tries to organise a mass
protest might as well bash his head against
a brick wall. The other week a wild-
eyed citizen, sick of being pushed around
by officials, stood up in the waiting room
of a Government department and let him-
self go before a crowd of perhaps 25 of
both sexes. For the most part they re-
garded him as a freak, until he lost his
temper and accused them of having
neither the brains nor the spirit to assert
themselves, whereupon a.young man de-
manded, “Well, what can we do? Tell us
that!” The reformer paused, reflected,
then flung at them, “Well, it’s tax-form
time. If everybody refused to fill in a
tax form that’d be something, wouldn’t
it?” But the expressions of horror on
the faces of his audience, whether at the
suggestion or at the mere mention of such
a thing as taxation at this stage, were so
obvious that the would-be liberator shot
a startled glance around the room and
then fled.
* * * *
“O’Yen”: Habits of “butt-stabbers”
(“Fitz,” B. 3/7/’46)? Young, tall and
dark, he got in at a suburban station and
almost apologetically asked me for a
cigarette. A non-smoker, I couldn’t
oblige. “Then you won’t have any
matches,” he said, half-expectantly.
“No,” I returned. My interlocutor then
produced a partly-smoked gasper and
awaited the arrival of other passengers,
from one of whom he got a light. At the
terminus we were the sole occupants of
the compartment. Before we alijghted,
with a preliminary “You don’t mind, I
hope,” he gathered the butts from the
carriage floor.
* * * *
“B.”: At a staging camp chance picked
on us for kitchen duty, and we found our-
selves washing-ujp for the cooks. No
bigger mountain of unclean utensils had
ever faced any of us before, and a couple
of hours’ honest work made no apparent
difference to the heap. Suspecting doub-
ling-up, Bluey made a private mark on
one of the pans, delivered it shining, and
got it back 10 minutes later worse than
ever. Diffidently, he made a comment to
the cook. “Look,” said the weary babbler,
“there’s four different dinners today for
four different drafts. Anyway, didn't
anyone ever tell you that using a lot of
dishes is a sign of a good cook?” “I
don’t doubt it,” shot back Blue, “but
we’ll take your word for it —there’s no
need to use sign language to us.”
* * * *
“Hist”: So the secret compartment in
the old writing desk has done it again!
At Dalkeith Palace, ducal seat of the
Buccleuchs, an old leather writing case
has yielded up part of a sheet of one of
the world’s first stamps —Britain’s 2d.
blue, issued in 1840. The 48 stamps, which
cost Bs. across the p.-o. counter, have
been sold by auction in London for
£6OO0 —my idea of a satisfactory lay-by.
But Australia also has its finds. I know
an ex-p.-0.-w. who unearthed from a
trunk into which he had stuffed his civvy
possessions on enlistment five sealed tins
of pre-war cigarettes —those round tins of
50 we used to buy so casually for about
2s. 9d. He was trembling with emotion
when he showed them to me.
* * * *
“Ichabod Crane”: “Jasby’s” claim that
many nursery rhymes had origins any-
thing but respectable (B. 3/7/’46) reminds
me of a successful pageant staged by the
pupils of our infants’ school. The little
darlings put on a great show, and doting
mothers and grandmas were delighted.
When the most determined nark and
wowser in the town turned from watching
the Maypole dancing to say: “How
sweetly pretty it is, Mr. Crane! I love
to see the little pets enjoying such inno-
cent pleasures,” I couldn’t help wonder-
ing what her reactions would be if she
were told that she was witnessing a
diluted survival of priapic rites whose
origins may be traced in The Golden
Bough, and that our distant ancestors
were wont to let themselves go when they
went a-Maying.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
“You can’t drive strikers back to work by force
of the law. I don’t condone the Queensland strike,
but what would the Opposition do?’’ —Mr. Chifley.
What would you do? Poor Chifley wrings his
hands
And of the world in general demands
What anyone could do when chaps refuse
To keep the laws, excepting when they choose;
What possible alternative can be
To ignominious inactivity
When unions whose support your job ensures
Give you their orders, ’stead of taking yours.
In such a case he pleads you’ll tell him true
What would you do?
What would you do when moral suasion gets
No more results than hollow-sounding threats,
When in an awkward quandary you’re pinned
’Twixt laws you daren’t enforce and daren’t
rescind,
When you’ve no path to tread, no course to
keep,
But one between the Devil and the deep,
When, if you dodge Charybdis, you may fill a
Place equally calamitous on Scylla?
With bullets just as tough as these to chew
What would you do?
What would you do, one hears his plaintive
voice
Lugubriously appealing, if your choice
Lay between letting your own country be
Abandoned to industrial anarchy
And being slated as the faithless friend
Of those, you know full well, if you offend
Who’ll kick you from your place and queer your
pitch
And leave you, down and outed, in the ditch?
He puts it to y«u all, no matter who,
What would you do?
What would yo.u do? Please to enlighten me,
He asks. A curious interrogatory,
A verbal challenge that suggests the thought
The answer that would suit him best is—
naught.
And that would likely point the safest way,
Beneath the shadow of election day,
For that quaint crowd, led by a sawdust king,
Which shrinks from what it’s there for —
governing,
Content to whine and whinge when things look
blue,
What would you do?
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Pitt St.”: After ruining four or five
income-tax return forms in a vain effort
to complete one —they never were easy
and authorities aker them a little each
year—l took a breather and a cup of tea,
idly picking up an American magazine.
A fill-up paragraph on the open page
soberly reported that a citizen of the
great republic, engaged on the same job
as myself, came to a blank space on the
form which bore the printed instruction,
“Do not write in this space.” With an
unholy howl he grabbed his pen and
scrawled across the space, “I’ll writel
where I damn’ well please.” Wherever he
was at that moment he must have felt the
impact of the fellow-feeling that travelled
across the wide seas as I, closing my eyes,
saw him standing there in the room, grin-
ning at me in conspiratorial triumph.
Ten minutes later I’d completed my form
and gone light-heartedly to bed.
“Viz”: Doesn’t “L. de R.” (B. 3/7/’46)
put his finger on the fallacy of phonetic
spelling when he admits that, in spite of
diverse dialects, “one Chinese can com-
municate with another if both know the
written language,” solely because the
written character is independent of local
pronunciation? Little changes, taken one
at a time, are the steps by which a living
language climbs to wider usefulness, but
sweeping reforms in the interests of
“scientific spelling” cannot easily be
assimilated. Anyway, I doubt whether
the reform could be carried out without
swarms of eye-tantalising hooks and dots.

“Lower Tops’l”: After three and a
half years up north with the army small-
ships, the schooner Alma Doepel has
returned to the Derwent as a motor
“Better hop in for your cut , Doc. — they’re starting."
vessel and disguised with a mass of ugly
deckhousing. The fact that the 43-year-
old hooker is again to be rigged as a
three-masted fore-and-aft schooner for
the timber trade to Port Phillip speaks
well for bygone New South Wales ship-
wrights. Unlike most Tassie-owned
sailers, the Doepel first took the water
at Bellinger River as the last Australian-
built vessel to cross square topsail-yards
(these were removed 10 years ago). Be-
fore active service the old windbag aver-
aged 10 crossings a year, and with over
400 to her credit she holds the Mel-
bourne-Hobart record for a sailing vessel.
Though never a flier, she once made the
passage in just under three days, but, with
that delightful uncertainty of sailers, she
more often took weeks. She has nosed
into almost every anchorage in Bass
Strait without coming to grief, though in
1921, when she was sheltering at Stanley;
the wind veered suddenly to the nor’-east
“big end first” and her skipper succes-
fuily belted her off a lee shore while the
old wooden barque Wild Wave dragged
to her doom.
* * * *
“A.C.M.”: Certainly the Londoner
would not speak of the subway (B.
3/7/’46), but in Glasgow, in my time, the
underground service was always referred
to by that name. Perhaps the term
travelled to America in a bottle of Scotch
and has only just returned to its home
island, as so many words now classed as
American have done. Anyway, the other
terms of which complaint is made —“ice-
box” and clothes-closet —are real English
words and. self-explanatory, whereas
“loughboy” (which word I hope “Taz”
does not use) is as explicit as a politician
explaining his policy.

“Parent”: To cope with a greatly-
increased number of students, Melbourne
Uni. Council is opening a country branch
for freshers next year. Air Force build-
ings at Mildura will be utilised, and it is
anticipated that over 60 per cent, of the
students will be ex-servicemen. Lecture-
rooms and laboratories will be air-
conditioned, and huts subdivided into
cubicles and studies. There are a theatre
with seating for 600, a canteen, a cafeteria
and ample space for recreation. Women
students will occupy the W.A.A.A.F.
quarters with separate rooms and studies.
The station has its own airstrip, and com-
mercial, ’planes land regularly within
walking distance. As well as escaping the
cramped and overcrowded conditions in
Melbourne, these young people will
pioneer a new venture in decentralisation.
The experiment shows vision and realism
not always associated in the public mind
with the academic outlook.

“Zake”: According to some of our
highest brows, German lieder and Russian
songs should be sung exclusively in the
language of the composers. I recently
heard a recital given over completely to
the songs of Brahms, Schumann, Schu-
bert and Hugo Wolf. They were beauti-
ful songs, beautifully sung —but all in a
language which seems to have been based
on a permanent catarrhal condition. It
was so much gibberish. Russian songs
are even worse. But what a difference
when they are given a good transla-
tion! Australian baritone Harold Wil-
liams showed what could be done with
them when, at his farewell concert in
Sydney, he sang the Death from
Moussorgsky’s “Boris Godounov.” He
acted as well as sang this aria, and the
audience was given a glimpse of the
depth of the Pushkin drama, probably for
the first time. It is high time singers
realised that English is the world’s richest
language, and that it is as easy for a
real singer to sing in English as it is to
intone words which mean nothing to
most of their audience,

“Cauboy”: I came up against a portent
of the future at an amateur performance
of an Australian play in Melbourne. In
the middle of the proceedings a young
man with the confident air of being on
an important mission walked up the aisle
until he was within a few yards of the
footlights, raised a strange hooded perka-
kus and snapped a button. There was a
blinding flash which momentarily threw
the actors on their beam ends. The young
man then calmly wouna his him to the
next position and took another. An ama-
teur photographic society holds that a
drama should be photographed in action,
and I believe that the dailies are follow-
ing its example and have even got permis-
sion from professional theatres to photo-
graph performances. Rehearsals aren’t
good enough for them. They call it “ser-
vice to the public,” but I resent this in-
trusion on the arts. It will be a sad spec-
tacle if the moment a world-famous singer
opens her mouth or an actor starts to tear
a passion to tatters newspaper photo-
graphers are allowed to advance to the
platform and discharge a barrage of flash-
lights.
* * * *
.“Bisley”: The permanent force of
fortress engineers to which I was
attached had special regulations for the
carrying of swagger canes (“W.O. Two,”
B. 3/7/’46): “All ranks may carry canes
when on leave” ; “The Orderly Sergeant,
Orderly Corporal and Picquet shall wear
side arms and shall carry a cane.” Many
and varied were the sizes and shapes of
those caneS. Some were the regulation
stick of little more than two feet in length ;
others were elaborate polished affairs with
brass or silver knobs plain or engraved.
“Gingerbeers” having access to modern
workshops went in for “foreign” orders
in a big way, and some full-length walk-
ing sticks brought two or three pounds.
“Ellery”: Now and then I have been
roped in as Sunday-evening lecturer to
cultural societies that permit the general
public to attend their meetings, but I have
decided that the game is not worth a
candle. Members present are few; log-
rollers and cranks many. They bom-
bard you with cunningly-worded ques-
tions only remotely related to the
subject of your address, and embark
upon wild attacks couched in the
jargon of the cause they espouse. I once
gave a talk on the necessity for preserving
historic landmarks, and had to face a
barrage from a single-taxer, a social-
crediter, Commos (two brands), a vege-
tarian and an anti-vivisectionist, all hav-
ing come to get in propaganda on the
cheap.
* * * *
“X.S.”: It is becoming quite the fashion
nowadays for Judges to order accused
persons to be sent to psychoanalysts for
treatment. I suppose they sincerely think
that they are doing better than the Judges
of the old school who ordered the lash
or some similar corrective treatment, and
in a sense they are. Unfortunately, how-
ever, you can’t send a person to a psy-
chologist. He must go because he wants
to. If he is sent he is only going from
one official authority to another, and as
the psychologically-sick’s trouble is a
reaction against authority very little suc-
cess is obtained. An army psychologist
told me that he had so little success with
his patients that he became completely
discouraged ; in many cases patients who
W'ere only hovering on the borderline
went over it as a result of the kindliest
treatment.
“Laetitia”: “Pawang’s” experience (B.
3/7/’46) fits the Freudian theory of re-
membering Ind forgetting —that such for-
gettings of surnames are deliberate and
subconsciously motivated. Freud main-
tained that all error is .deliberate —a con-
tention which I disputed, since it damned
me as a deliberate pilferer of my col-
leagues’ pencils and matches, which were
always turning up in my pockets. How-
ever, after regretfully reflecting that the
University Library rules forbade the tak-
ing home of Freud’s Psychology of
Error, which I had been reading avidly,
I set out for my digs. Arriving there I
found that I had inadvertently brought
the book home with me. To do this I
had eluded the lynx-eyed librarian, a feat
which would have been impossible if
deliberately attempted. Post-haste I re-
turned the book. Back again in my room
I concluded that the Freudian theory that
things are only forgotten when there is an
unpleasant association with them was
knocked flat by the discovery that I had
left my hat behind in the library. Then
suddenly I remembered; the forgotten
hat was a subconsciously motivated
reparation for the similarly executed theft
of the text-book.
* * * *
“Curtain Raiser”: Mention of Nellie
Stewart appearing in the first production
of “Faust” at the Princess, Melbourne, in
1888 (B. 3/7/’46) recalls the most sombre
tragedy that ever cast a gloom over an
Australian first night. Federici, as
Mephistopheles, died as he descended
through the trapdoor into the infernal
regions singing the last notes of the opera.
No actor since has dared to descend to
hell by the same trapdoor, and an attempt
by one producer to revive the practice
resulted in a broken leg, which confirmed
the theatrehands’ opinion that the ghost
of Federici haunts the Princess. I’m told
the singer has frequently been seen at the
back of the stage making acid comments
on the critics. What he thinks of the
talkies, to which the Princess is now
dedicated, has never been recorded.
* * * •
“V. Cluse”: The Jephsons had had a
heavy fortnight with accident and disease,
two children in bed and a third not too
good and Mrs. J., what with this and
the current disabilities of short supplies
and transport, had reached a stage bor-
dering on the hysterical. Jephson man-
aged to find a “minder” and took his
wife off to the pictures in an effort
to cheer her up. The first opus was full
of goodies, baddies and gun-play and the
missus liked it and was happy. The next
started well, then degenerated into one
of those Hollywood versions of how;
great surgeons save life and limb with
the aid of astoundingly lovely and shapely
nurses whose main idea is lurv, with the
usual shots of operating theatres, instru-
ments, masked faces, gloved hands,
bodies on wheeled stretchers, long-drawn
moments of anxiety and so forth. Which
is why, about half-way through, there
was a mild flurry and Jephson was seen
being dragged from the theatre by an
irate woman.
* * * *
“Birkel Gil”: Anent the departed and
unrepaired destroyer Piet Hein. The
name is that of a gallant 17th-century
Dutch sea-captain, whose greatest victory
is told in a folk-song called “De Zilver-
vloot,” still widely sung in Holland —and
at meetings of the Melbourne Uni. Dutch
Club. Piet Hein himself was a merchant
skipper, taken prisoner by the Spaniards
and made to work as a galley-slave. After
a few years he was exchanged for a
Spanish prisoner, and his previous deeds
had so impressed the rulers of Holland
that he was given command of a fleet of
men-of-war. These ships were stationed
off the coast of Cuba in 1628, lying in
wait for treasure-laden Spanish galleons.
The song relates how Piet Hein led his
men in the boarding of the galleons:
“They climbed in the rigging like cats,
they fought like lions, and beat the Spani-
ards so thoroughly that their screams
could be heard in Spain! ” The song tella
no more of Piet Hein, but it is known
that he .was killed in the following year
(1629), while attacking the pirates who
pestered the Dutch East Indies traders.
TENNIS TEMPERS.
“This year 's Wimbledon championships were marred
by rudeness, cantankerous scowls and mutterings at
officials, snarls at ball-boys, petulant throwing-down
of racquets and slamming balls into the stands.”
Time was they termed Suzanne temperamental
When her supremacy on courts began,
And now for methods rough and modes ungentle
The boot’s found fitter for the foot of man.
You champs who “fight” beneath your nations
banners . '
With cunning placements and with smashing
knocks
It’s clearly up to you to mend your manners
And cease to “do your blocks.”
When eminent practitioners are meeting
In friendly rivalry, excuse there’s none
For inability to take a beating
As cheerfully as in inflicting one.
If you have grievances forbear to vent ’em.
One Latin tag that never comes amiss
Is Horace’s /Equam servare mentem
Rebus in arduis.
Let no bad slips or sudden, swift reverses,
Or even rulings you regard as foul,
Tempt you to half-articulated curses
Or twist your pleasing features to a scowl.
And never fling your racquet down in dudgeon
And peevish petulance, for that’s the sort
Of gesture, for an ill-behaved curmudgeon
And not a dead-game sport.
That stinging brand “not cricket,” well we
ken, is
A phrase that some unworthiness denotes ;
And presently mayhap we’ll have “not tennis”
For oafish pranks that get, spectators’ goats.
So keep in mind, you aces in the making,
However good it feels to score a win
Still better is capacity for taking
Your setbacks with a grin.

When men are at work they are usually in good
health. They have, too, the money with which to
make provision for their families" present welfare.
It is then also that they
have the opportunity to co-
operate with their fellow
citizens in building up future
security for their dependents,
and for their own old age,
through Life Assurance. This
is an opportunity that no
one should miss. Australians
are paying regularly into the
Life Offices at the rate of
£25,000,000 a year. This
money is invested for the
benefit of all policy-holders
and the interest earned is
added to their funds.
At the present time these
funds total about £300,000,
000 which, together with the
premiums and interest to be
received in future, will pro-
vide the money necessary
for the Life Offices to meet
all the promises made to
their policy-holders.
Like all co-operative move-
ments, Life Assurance is
purely voluntary. Those who
become policy-holders of a
Life Assurance Office are
free to arrange for just as
much security and pro-
tection as they feel they
need.

“Ek Dum”: Expeditionaries—officers
and men —from the East Indian front
continue to drift into Sydney with stories
of what is going on there. It is not pretty.
Outside the immediate string of islands
of which Java and Sumatra are the heart,
the whole of the area is loyal to
the Dutch. But in the main island
and in Sumatra sedition and hatred
flourish. Loyal men, women and children,
still hidden away in the jungle in cap-
tivity, are starving. The lives of Aus-
tralians going about the ordinary pre-
cautionary duty of cleaning up the Jap-
anese, many of whom seem to be in hid-
ing with the assistance of the insurgents
whom they armed, were in dire danger
from those whom they were supposed to
have rescued from an implacable enemy.
The kidnapping for a time of Sjahrir,
the “Premier,” and his replacement
without reprisals show the true situation.
It left in command for the time being
Soekarno, the president of the “Indo-
“ George , cant you ever forget you Were once a chief stoker?”

beyond question, in Japanese broadcasts
to have been a Japanese collaborator.

smells of Communist technique —the same
sort of technique which keeps Australians
in the Communist group of unions in a
continual ferment of hate and suspicion.
Every prejudice against the white has been
raised which it is possible to raise, every
facet of hate played upon. The Moham-
medan is enlisted in the cause of Pan-
Islam, the half-colored in the interest of
his own supposed status; the savage or
near-savage is tempted with the thought
of the return of his ancient rights of
bloodshed, the sultans with the vision of
a return of their power, the greedy
with the chances of wholesale loot. Every
motive of rapacity and lust is brought
into play by whispering and by playing
on the feelings of the ill-conditioned
youth who likes the feel of a gun-stock
in his palm.
Behind it all are the whispering Jap-
anese and the shouting Communists, some
of whom were trained in Australia at
the party’s special schools during the war,
and who are now in full blast. It should
not be forgotten that when it came to
“deporting” these ruffians the Common-
wealth Government gave them the option
of being sent to New Guinea. The Dutch
authorities have photographs of caches
of weapons and literature seized in their
camps before they left Australia —moun-
tains of copies of Australian Communist
pamphlets and papers, mingled with every
sort of weapon, from a jemmy to an out-
size butcher’s knife, from a cane knife
(which is as deadly as a gurkha’s kukri
and can slice a man’s head off at a blow)
to American automatics.
Our men back from the front say that
the Dutch were not mistaken in the char-
acter and intentions of these savages;
that life (except their own) means nothing
to them, and a Japanese as good an in-
strument of their purpose as any other.
Japanese Initiative
Two things some returning Australians
are clear upon—they are men of all
classes, some of whom went into the
N.E.I. with sympathy for the Indonesian
cause. One is that the whole business
was organised with Japanese connivance
and help. The second is that what is
happening in the N.E.L is not an isolated
incident. It is part of a chain of well-
thought-out and organised events like
those along the eastern Mediterranean
shores, designed for the isolation of India
by two rebellious belts as a preliminary
to the entry of Russia into Indian Ocean
and Pacific politics on a large scale.
A very highly experienced diplomat—
not one of Dr. Evatt’s raw boys, but a
man who has served in all parts of the
world—told the writer he believed
that all the Russian manceuvrings. in
Europe were secondary at the moment,
though later they would become primary.
Asia, he said, was the immediate objec-
tive of the U.S.S.R., the centre in which
its primary work of smashing the British
Empire must be done.
By causing riot and disorder turning
to rebellion in India and Burma and
Malaya, by filtering the worst types of
nationless Jews (types which decent Jews
would shudder to mix with) into Pale-
stine, by keeping Persia in a state of
ferment, by disorganising and hamstring-
ing the Chinese and stripping Manchuria,
by organising to Communise Japan
(where Mr. Macmahon Ball seems
no particular obstacle) they are preparing
for the near future When they hope to lay
their hands on the whole of Asia. Only
a few weeks ago, unnoticed, they filched
a strategic strip of territory from Afghani-
stan on the military road to India —it was
“ceded by friendly agreement.”
Lastly there is their intensive effort to
turn Australia into a Communist State,
on which they must be spending more
than Mr. Calwell is spending on propa-
ganda in the United States and elsewhere.
A survey of last year’s Communist ex-
penditure in Australia discloses that it
must have run to £lBO,OOO on registered
newspapers, pamphlets, books, broad-
casting time and in general advertising.
And this estimate does not take in the
myriad small local rags and pamphlets
with which this country teems.
And propaganda, of course, is only a
tithe of the whole bill, which must run
nearer to £1,000,000 a year than £lBO,OOO.

“Ek Dum”: The saddest part about the
vigorous evening which the returning
Australian victory parade contingent en-
joyed at Gibraltar recently is the atmos-
phere created round it by Mr. Frank
Forde and the peahen press.

whose correspondent’s accuracy has
“never been questioned,” should have
been received with pride by^thejpeanei^

press, since the ideal of the Australian
soldier as pictured by that press has been
quite in keeping with what supposedly
happened there. The Australian soldier
in the peahen-press world has always been
an arrogant, slightly tipsy, leering fellow
with an utter disregard of anybody else’s
rights, a forthright entity given to baiting
his officers and showing a larrikin outlook
in untidy uniforms and rough and un-
mannerly behavior.
When an isolated Australian soldier
lives up to type, however, the press be-
comes more annoyed than is justified, and
even indulges in the sacrilege of express-
ing a doubt about the infallibility of
Reuter’s, whose yhrds of tripe about Ger-
man armies which evaporated in a day
before the onslaught of Russian horse-
men they accepted as evidence from the
Highest Court.
From the confused mass of affirmation
and denial which forms the all-too-pro-
longed relation of Gibraltar events, the
established facts seem to be that some
celebrating Australians became riotous,
in circumstances about which witnesses
differ widely, and came into conflict with
the police in circumstances about
which some of the police at any
rate have no doubt whatever, since
two of them were still in hospital a week
after the event —one with broken ribs and
one with concussion. It is also clear that
the police felt no compunction in using
batons, which are “normal equipment,”
but that no individual charges were laid
against the Australians.
The extreme versions are those of the
correspondent and of Mr. Forde, but the
events of the evening, if they had hap-
pened even as recorded by the correspon-
dent, would have passed with little com-
ment, other than horrible photographs of
the injured civilians in the Sydney press,
if they had taken place in Mr. Ward’s
electorate. Only a few nights ago a gang
of thugs at the great traffic five-ways in
Mr. Ward’s electorate, within hail of a
central police station, knocked down a
civilian and nearly kicked him to death.
And even though that event occurred hard
by the High and Central Criminal Court
building and the toughs were not caught
it was forgotten within 24 hours.
So the Gibraltar event would have been
forgotten had it not been for the
Minister for the Army and the peahen
press. London newspapers and 8.8. C.
scarcely mentioned it.
Mr. Forde’s effort was typical. He
“called for a report.” He said that
“official accounts from Gibraltar so far
indicate that the conduct of the Austra-
lian Victory contingent was very satis-
factory,” that “the whole of the informa-
tion so far supported the ‘Daily Mirror's’
story that there had been no riot in Gib-
raltar”—this in the face of a report by
Major-General Eather that the business
had “developed” from a “minor incident”
involving a small group of Australian
troops, that batons were used and that in
the end about 100 of the contingent and
of the Shropshire crew were involved.
Mr. Forde felt bound to add that the
London police vouched for it that the
Australians were “the best-behaved body
of servicemen ever to visit London,” and
that he had “the greatest admiration for
the gallant men of the Australian fighting
services.... a body of men who have
no superiors in any fighting services in
the world.”
The unfortunate fact about fighting
men is their natural tendency to fight.
This is taken for granted everywhere ex-
cept in modern Australia.
Wherever British troops and those
forthright fighters the ancient order of
naval stokers foregather with Mediter-
ranean wine or Irish whisky, there have
been glorious fights for generations. The
yell of “belts” in Silver-street when the
lads of the Curragh are abroad, and the
spectacle of the grand piano cantering
“on three castors down the quay” are
regarded by the natives of appropriate
localities as natural phenomena sent to
relieve an otherwise dull existence and to
improve the drink trade.
British home folk from Liverpool,
Cahirsaveen and
not a little pride in the prowess of'their
men, descendants of the “personnel” of
old India-based regiments like the 71st
and 75th, which sometimes fought each
other for days together in the environs
of Bombay and elsewhere —our own Gov-
ernor Macquarie was on “officers’ guard”
for three solid days and nights during
one of these affairs.
The writer once saw part of the crew
of a British destroyer hurl about half the
complement of two of Musso’s brightest
cruisers into the filth of Port Said harbor
(with some police for dessert), without in-
spiring more than two lines in one Lon-
don paper and none at all in Musso’s
flamboyant controlled press, which hid
the shame to its might. Gibraltar was
news only because Australians were in-
volved and because a young man from
Reuter’s happened to be there and be-
cause Australia has a peahen press.
The peahen press is now hard on the
scent of the unfortunate passengers on
the Shropshire. Of these it now has such
a poor opinion that it records as news
that they were “well-behaved” at Malta.
Bombs and Burns.
‘Ek Dum”: The first documented
medical reports on atom-bombing results
are in the “American Journal of Roent-
geneology.”
They are concerned with the results of
the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9,
1945. It is set out that much of the
energy released by the bomb was in the
form of radiation, the remainder and
greater part being heat. The analysis of
what happened is an attempt to evaluate
the effects of radiation in the north-
western sector of the city, where the
bomb actually fell. It was based on the
examination of 95 badly-injured persons
out of 1010 in three hospitals, the rest
having either died or (more frequently)
been discharged.
There was a lethal area up to 1000
metres from the site of the explosion, in
which there were few survivors—all at its
puter edges. (There was little protection
against the actual blast or means of sub-
sequent protection against the fires started
in a large area of flimsy buildings, mostly
of rice paper and wood.) One man in the
open survived. He was sitting on his
haunches talking to two men, who died
three days later from explosion results.
The second zone extended from 1000
to 1250 metres from the blast centre.
Here there were nine of the 95, in concrete
buildings, who survived. Four suffered
from mild Roentgen sickness —emacia-
tion, diarrhoea and other effects. Twelve
who were under less efficient protection
suffered from severe Roentgen sickness.
Zone 3 in the survey extended from
J 250 to 1500 metres from the blast.
Within it, though there were symptoms
of radiation, results were much less
severe. In the fourth (1500 to 1750
metres from blast) and fifth beyond 1750
metres, no symptoms of Roentgen sick-
ness, apart from loss of appetite for a
few days, were reported. There were,
however, in all zones, as far as 2500
metres (more than \\ miles), from the
centre of explosion, many cases of super-
ficial burns and penetrating radiation.
People in the open within the 1250 metres
of centre received both types and usually
died.
The bulk of the survivors came from
zones outside that radius. They reported
that they saw the flash of the explosion
and felt no heat, but several seconds later,
when they looked down, they realised
they had been burned. Almost any
article of clothing seems to have pro-
tected them adequately. Where there
were seams, the course of them was left
etched on the body in a line of natural,
unbranded flesh, while surrounding areas
were marked according to me thickness
and absorbent qualities of the covering.
The burned areas always faced the source
of radiation, and were not nearly so
severe when the rays struck the body at
a tangent. But, horrible as the results
are to look at, healing was quick and
clean and all the examples shown in the
article had healed by October. They
were, however, marked by pigmentation
in a manner familiar to every worker hi
X-ray therapy.
In the zones between 1000 and 1250
metres, 76 per cent, of individuals lost
their hair ; in the belt beyond, up to 1500
metres, 22 p.c.; in the outer zones, much
less.
These conclusions, readied by the noted
X-ray therapist Dr. John C. Larkin,
M.D., support those which have been
suggested in these pages. Dr. Larkin says
that in the type of bombing at Nagasaki
there is adequate radiation protection be-
yond 1000 metres from the blast, in a
concrete roof. Where there was injury
under such a roof it was caused by flying
glass and debris from windows near which
the victims were standing. Wooden
buildings in the 1000-1250 metre zone
gave sufficient protection against super-
ficial burns, but no protection against
radiation —clothing protects against burns.
Even persons severely injured by radia-
tion and burns were apparently not per-
manently injured. From the fad that no
heat was felt by them and the general
appearance and rapidity of the healing, it
was concluded that the burning agent was
also the heat-producing agent—ultra-
violet, visible light and infra-red rays.
On the whole, the bomb is a horrible
weapon, but there is defence against its
most horrible features. It will un-
doubtedly bring back what the pressboys
have long sneered at —the Maginot Line
complex, since, on the strength of the
demonstrations so far given, it would be
harmless against troops in such a forti-
fication. What the bomb will do when
exploded at ground level has yet to be
shown. It is beyond question that scien-
tists must know, and that the bomb was
made to explode in the air because in the
air its deadliness was at maximum.

PPERSONAL ITEMS
Tasmania is to have two school cen-
tenaries within two months. In June the
Launceston Grammar School held a week
of celebrations, including a flying visit
from the head of The King’s School, Parra-
matta, H. G. Hake. In the first week in
August, Hobart will reply with the cen-
tenary of the Hutchins School and the
initiation of a building programme. Hut-
chins began with the Buckland family and
they brought with them ideas of character
and school government from Rugby, then
under the rule of Dr. Arnold. Present
head, Paul Radford, son of a Bishop of
Goulburn and Warden of St. Paul’s, seems
to think there should be discipline in the
Public Schools,. if nowhere else. The
oldest Hutchins Old Boy is A. P. Can-
away, the senior member of the New
South Wales Bar and still in practice at
89. He rowed in the trials at Oxford
and sang “We Don’t Want to Fight, But
By Jingo, If We Do” when Disraeli and
Gladstone were abroad in the land. Old
Boys in N. S. Wales will hold a centen-
ary dinner on August 1 at the Wentworth.
At the time of his death, J. L. Baird,
pioneer of television, was working on an
invention capable of handling all Britain’s
daily outgoing cable traffic in three
minutes —7 50,000 words a minute. When
E. G. Brooke, Australian Divisional Man-
ager of Cable-and-Wireless, first joined the
service at Georgetown, Tasmania, a speed
of 140 letters a minute was considered
something special, and an operator who
could push signals through to Flinders
at that speed was considered a wizard.
E. G. Brooke is English. Coming to
Melbourne in youth, he bought a Morse
key in a second-hand shop and prac-
tised in his diggings, eventually join-
ing Eastern Extension as an operator in
1885. Since then he has risen through
the various grades to manager for Aus-
tralia, a position be has held for over a
quarter of a century. At 81 he looks as
spry as many men with half his tale of
years behind him and walks, overcoatless,
to work through Melbourne’s worst
winter weather. He is treasurei of the
Moonee Valley Racing Club and owned
Tea Cake, which won the Caulfield
Guineas in 1941.
Australian engineers in the Island
campaigns found themselves up against
problems as tough as any encountered by
their colleagues in other theatres of war,
and their success in solving them can be
credited largely to Clive Selwyn Steele,
who, as Major-General and Engineer-in-
Chief, Allied Land Forces, s.-w. Pacific,
was responsible for their organisation and
training. A civil and consulting engineer
of wide experience, Steele served with
Second Div. in the first war, winning a
Military Cross. When the Second A.LF.
was raised he became C.R.E. Sixth Div.
and in that capacity won a D.S.O. in
Greece. His personal achievements in
design—the Steele bridge for heavy load-
ings anticipated the Bailey bridge—im-
provisation and equipment have been of
great value, and the profession recognised
his work with the award of the Kernot
Medal.
Norman Offor Dart, the Service party’s
Queensland and Federal secretary, is a
slim, energetic young man in the mid-
thirties, Brisbane-born and educated
at Brisbane High, he has tried his
hand at many jobs, but before the
war was mainly interested in adver-
tising and the motor industry. Enlisting
in the A.LF. he saw service in New
Guinea with a signals unit. One of his
tent mates in the jungle was Bulletin
artist Cyril Dubois, who recalls that Dart
was known to everyone from the
down as “Flash.” The Service party,
which represents a middle-of-the-road
viewpoint, hopes to run a candidate in
every Federal electorate.
Re-elected president of the National
Museum of Victoria, Russell Grimwade,
C.8.E., is a director of Felton, Grimwade
and Duerdins, the firm of chemists who
are associated with some of Melbourne’s
biggest art benefactions. Alfred Felton
made the National Gallery one of the
world’s important purchasers of Old
Masters. Russell Grimwade gave Mel-
bourne Captain Cook’s lovely cottage. It
now stands in Fitzroy Gardens looking
through the trees at an all-steel, prefabri-
cated house which suggests a tin trunk
inadvertently dropped and forgotten.
The first books were bought for the
library of Sydney University as far back
as 1851 * only since 1910, however, has
it had a building of its own, named after
its principal benefactor, Thomas Fisher,
who bequeathed to it the sum of £30,000.

handled books in any quantity as a page
in the library of The Royal Society of
N. S. Wales. He was 15 then, and two
years later moved up to the Fisher
Library as a junior assistant under The
Bulletin’s old friend Jack Le Gay
Brereton. World War I took him away
from Australia and landed him in Egypt
and France as an officer in the 45th
Battalion. Returning to his library job
in 1920, he graduated in Arts and had
an active part in University life, editing
“Hermes” for a period. Outside the
University he takes an active interest in
the welfare of returned soldiers and in
the library profession ; he has been presi-
dent of the N. S. Wales branch of the
Australian Institute of Librarians, and is
a member of the Library Board of N. S.
Wales. At the outbreak of World War
II he founded, along with other Sydney
librarians, the Camp Library Service,
which distributed over a million books
and magazines to the forces and which
led to the establishment of official Navy,
Army and Air Force education libraries.
Recent cable announced that the chief
medical officer to U.N.R.R.A. was in
London to consult headquarters concern-
ing Austria’s state. The officer is Colonel
J. D. Cottrell, 0.8. E., a Dunedin (M.L.)
man. He had been appointed medical
officer to the UN.R.R.A. mission to
Austria, and was able to report that the
Austrians had stood up well to the hard-
ships, which were mitigated by the mild
winter conditions.
Awarded the State Doctorate of Letters
by the University of Paris, Maorilander
Fraser Mackenzie, of Wellington, is the
first British citizen to be so honored as
well as the first to receive the doctorate
garbed wi’ a kilt. The thesis that won
him the distinction was completed in
1939, but the war intervening Mac was
precluded from appearing in the garb of
Auld Gael in Paree when the Germans
were in possession. Rid of that incubus,
the Paris University summoned Mac-
kenzie to come forth.
Kevyn Hume-Cook, who serves the
Liberal party in Victoria as public rela-
tions officer, as his father served the old
one, is an Eighth Divvy ex-p.o.w. who
tasted the privations of Changi and the
horrors of the Burma-Siam railway. Dis-
charged. after five years’ service, he re-
turned to the Chamber of Manufac-
tures. He was formerly assistant
secretary of the Australian Industries Pro-
tection League, which his father ran for
nearly two decades. If he is as pas-
sionate and voluminous a propagandist
as the old man was, he ought to do well.
F. T. Perry, one of the two manu-
facturers’ representatives nominated for
the industrial mission which leaves for
India in September, is a South Australian.
Son of a parson, he was born at Gawler,
also the birthplace of his Perry En-
gineering Co., and has been president and
chairman of many organisations, includ-
ing, in 1942, the Associated Chambers of
Manufactures. He was M.H.A. from 1933
to 1938 and during the war was chairman
on the Adelaide Board of the Ministry
of Munitions. C. A. M. Derham, of
Melbourne, will be his travelling com-
panion. Derham is director and g.-m.
of Swallow and Ariell, has been president
of the Victorian Chamber of Manufac-
tures and collected a Military Cross in
World War I.
There’s not much in common between
the Royal Chelsea Flower Show and the
New Guinea jungle, but for the past 11
years Herbert Brown, whose greatest
pleasure previously had been the annual
collection of prizes at the show, has been
spreading the Gospel among the natives
of Goilala district in Papua. A graduate
in Arts of London University, Brown is
a black-and-white artist of considerable
merit, a keen anthropologist—a first-class
honors man in that subject and theology
—and has translated the scriptures, into
the local dialect. In his work for the
London Missionary Society he is assisted
by his wife, formerly a nursing sister at
the leper station near Port Moresby.
Payneham (S.A.) plans to build a**
£3OOO Children’s Centre as a memorial to
a great-hearted medico, Ernest Borthwick,
who died last year at 75 after 46 years
in practice. In the district stories of the
doctor’s humanity and generosity are
legion—an unending list of visits un-
charged for, prescriptions made up at his
own expense, meat and firewood supplied
(and paid for) on doctor’s orders and
countless other acts of charity that brought
him no reward save the joy of their do-
ing. The memorial, which is to be built
by public subscription from residents of
the district—his practice extended up into
the foothills of the Mt. Lofty Ranges—
will include a baby clinic, a playground
and a free kindergarten.

“Dick Tafone”: The appointment of
Dorothy Marshall as U.N.R.R.A.’s dir-
ector-general of welfare in the British-
occupied zone in Germany is another
well-earned feather in the cap of Aus-
tralian womanhood. A native of Adel-
aide, Miss Marshall was superintendent
of the Land Army in S.A. during the war
years up to 1945, when she resigned to
go abroad. After being held up for
months by one of the passport ukases of
the period, she eventually reached Ger-
many, to become Director of District Wel-
fare for displaced persons, with charge
of the principal camp in the British zone.
Her work in that capacity led to her
present appointment.
R. B. Bradley, appointed chairman of

in succession to just-retired G. I. Mc-
Hemy, came to this country in 1939 after
a rapid climb up the ladder in various
U.S. branches of the parent company.
He hails from Texas, but is more inter-
ested in turning out efficient machines for

“Wongajon'g”: Bill Molloy, sub-editor
of the “Farmer and Settler,” Sydney, who
died last month, got his start on the Inky
Way as a copy boy on Sydney “Truth” in
the stormy days of John Norton. John
espied him one day and asked him his
name. “Willy,” replied young Molloy.
“Don’t be such a confounded little liar,”
thundered Norton, “Your name is not
Willy.” “But, please, Mr. Norton,” qua-
vered the boy, “it is Willy.” “You young
spawn of the Devil,” stormed the boss.
“I say it is not Willy.” The boy stood
his ground and insisted that it was. Then
John’s voice shook the old King-street
office. After castigating the lad in lurid
terms he ended with a triumphant shout:
“It’s not Willy, I tell you. It’s William —
William.” Then he dived his hand into
his pocket and produced the wherewithal
for a book on shorthand. William be-
came one of the paper’s smartest reporters
and eventually its editor.
Ernest Luxmoore, who retires from the
Elder Smith head office in Adelaide after
38 years of stock-sales work, is 63, but
doesn’t look it. He was master of Adel-
aide’s Hunt Club from 1914 to 1923 —
though war service cut into that term —
again from 1933 to 1936, and was be-
ginning once more in 1940 when another
war stopped hunting. He was a good

of the State’s eight in 1910. Nowadays he
sticks to yachting.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Having been almost frozen to death at
the first of the Grand National meetings,
women racegoers decided to dispense
with the spring-like trappings of fashion
for the Grand National Steeplechase
meeting at Flfimington, and even left
their gay little flower chapeaux at home.
Dressing was on the dismal side, for
coats were the order of the day, with
blacks, blues, browns and navy predomi-
nating. Several racegoers favored the
new coats with bell sleeves, a trim belted
waistline (one woman sported a patent
leather belt almost six inches wide), with
the skirt of the coat hanging full and free,
dirndl-like in its swinging lines. Yet
another new feature in coats was seen
in a Cavalier model with its double cape-
let, cut high to the neckline.
A black broadtail coat worn by Mrs.
A. Silk was made even more stunning by
the lashings of silver fox which edged
the opening. Lady Gifford, in Melbourne
for a few days prior to leaving for Eng-
land, came in a soft brown fur coat, and
Mrs. Theo Fairbaim favored lambswool,
also in brown tonings. Young racegoers
had their own way of brightening the
landscape. Toni Kirkpatrick pinned a
large spray of pearls in the form of lily
of the valley in her blonde curls, and
chose a tailored suit of leaf-green tweed.
Margaret Linehan’s cornflower-blue suit
featured a full pleated skirt.
Many beautiful floral tributes were re-
ceived by Joan Hammond at the con-
clusion of her first concert in this city.
It was not until towards the close of the
programme that the singer gave some of
the numbers by which her voice has be-
come so well-known to Australians ; but
the roar of applause which greeted such
favorites as “Oh, My Beloved Father”
and “Minnetonka” left no doubt of the
big audience’s feelings. Joan wore a long- -
sleeved gown of cream satin figured with
a silver bamboo design. Cut on slim
tailored lines, its only adornment was a
diamond brooch at the neckline and
matching ear-rings.
Frocking of the audience was still well
below pre-war standards, many women
still preferring short black dresses with
accent on headwear—lace, worn mantilla
style, ruched net in pastel shades and
flowers veiled either with black or match-
ing net, were favored. Mrs. T. J. Ryan
was a devotee of the formal —her pale
mauve evening gown was worn with a
long violet velvet coat. Her daughter,
Mrs. Raymond Lambert {her husband is
the soprano’s accompanist and associate
artist), was in a striking red taffeta bouf-
fant gown offset with a short bolero of
white fox. Joan’s father and mother were
there, she in a two-piece black suit edged
with pink under her long fur coat;
brother Anthony also was on hand to
give some family encouragement. Pianist
Viva Holgate Clarke, who will give her
own recital on August 30, was with friend
Vi Dunn, an attractive American.
One of the most popular girls in Mel-
bourne, Valerie Purves, who is the only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James G.
Purves, of Shenton, Toorak, has an-
nounced her engagement to James Elliott
Murray, Rhine Park, Eden, S.A., son of
the late Mrs. and Mrs. John Murray.
Valerie has been a most energetic worker
for charity. During the war she was
supervisor of the President’s branch of
the Red Cross Society at Government
House, and later became secretary of the
amenities committee of the Land Army
in Victoria. Before the war Valerie
travelled extensively in Europe and lived
for some time in London. For six years
she has been the fashion expert for
A.8.C.; she is also an excellent pianist
and an accomplished needlewoman. The
couple are to marry in October.
Major and Mrs. Bob Linton have been
in this city on a holiday from Perth ; to
welcome them and also to celebrate the
ninth wedding anniversary of the guests
of honor, Bob’s parents, knight Richard
and his lady, entertained over 200 guests
at a party at the beautiful Linton home
in Kensington-road, South Yarra. The
hostess wore a white ermine cape with
her long formal gown of black crepe
patterned in scarlet; Mrs. Bob Linton
also wore black crepe, relieved by trim-
mings of gold sequins and a silver fox
bolero. Host and hostess were assisted
by their younger son, Dick, who arranged
a cabaret show, given by former members
or Army, concert parties. Mrs. Dudley
Lauchlan s gown of ice-blue moire
featured the off-the-shoulder line, the
long trained skirt having an over skirt
which was draped round the hips and
finished with shirring at the back of the
waist. With Eric Avery was wife Freda,
whose long black crepe frock had a
matching jacket, the high shoulder line of
which was trimmed with sequins. The
ensemble chosen by Mrs. Theo Scales
struck an exotic note; satin in a tomato
shade was allied to a black top, but the
lines of the skirt were unusual —a slit in
the front of the skirt from ankles -almost
to the knees shirred on each side,
giving the appearance of a harem skirt.
The Alliance Franqaise de Victoria
celebrated its National Day with a dance
in the Lower Town Hall, which was deco-
rated with French flags and red, white and
blue bunting. As each of the 250 guests
entered the hall, he or she was presented
with tiny bows of tricolor ribbon. The
president, Madame Gay, and the Consul
for France, M. Loubere, received the
guests. Madame Cockerton, secretary of
the Alliance Fransaise, was an attractive
figure in an old-gold satin gown with
matching jacket. Pauline Cartmell chose
a frock, unusual and featuring the new
trend in evening glamor. It was of
black net worn over gold taffeta, had an
off-the-shoulder line and a bustle of the
net over the gold taffeta. One of the
most striking gowns seen was of white
crepe, the skirt being finished with a pep-
lum edged with white ermine tails, worn
with a hip-length box coat of scarlet
cloque satin.
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard
Heinze, wore an ice-blue blouse with her
black suit when she entertained members
of the Town Hall Entertainments Group.
This band of women began its work at
the outbreak of war by staffing a canteen
at the Town Hall, which was also a re-
cruiting depot. Every man as he en-
listed was served with a meal, and when
the depot was cldsed the group turned
its energies to raising money for various
war organisations, which they did by
baking cakes, scones and biscuits to the
tune of £7OOO. The luncheon table was
banked with palest-pink petunias and
begonias. Mrs. P. C. Coleman set off her
ice-blue frock with a small chapeau of
cyclamen velvet with veilings of ice-blue ;
Mrs. Bob Lane featured the new upswept
hair-do and pinned on a hat of cyclamen
and blue, while president of the group,
Mrs. *O. J. Neilsen, was suited in small
black-and-white checks with black hat.
This study by Broothorn is of Mrs.
John Cain, wife of Victoria’s Premier.
Mrs. Cain is on many committees for the
welfare of this city ; what little time she
has to spare she puts in on the golf course.
On August 1 a Centenary Ball to cele-
brate the 100th birthday of St. Peter’s
Church, Eastern Hill, will be held at No.
9 Darling-street, South Yarra, and many
girls who missed their “coming-out”
owing to the war will make their formal
bow to the Premier and Mrs. Cain.
Many of the debutantes will be members
of Mrs. Wallace Mitchell’s Younger Set.
Mrs. Dan Reddan is training the
“debs,” and Mesdames Eric Cottrell,
Norman Spry and Michael Ryan will act
as hostesses. St. Peter’s, opposite St. Pat-
rick’s Cathedral, is a small church but its
history is long. Governor Latrobe, who
set the foundation stone, was also a wor-
shipper there. Every Sunday soldiers
marched to St. Peter’s from their barracks
and filled the gallery. An altar frontal
over 300 years old is one of the many
beautiful gifts received in the past. The
cloth came from a church in Lebanon
destroyed by Turks, and silver vases
and a silver ewer, now in St. Peter’s, came
from the same church.
From Sydney
Sydney remembers with affection the
W.A.N.S., who brightened the city streets
with their blue uniforms and jaunty caps
in the early days of the war. This move-
ment was the first great expression of the
anxiety of women to aid their country in
its time of stress. From the stirring initial
rally at the Town Hall in 1940 in which
thousands of women, inside and out,
took part, to the day of victory, it
was a vital part of the war years. Train-
ing in the W.A.N.S. was very good
ground work for the duties of all
branches of the services, and by 1943
all the W.A.N.S. interested in defence
had enlisted. In the neatly-compiled
history of this movement, just published,
Mrs. A. C. Godhard and Mrs. Crawford
Vaughan are recorded as submitting the
original comprehensive plan. Lady
Gowrie’s and Lady Wakehurst’s active
interest was untiring.
Last week the W.A.N.S. had its final
party as a war-time organisation. Now
its members will work as ardently for
peace-time activities as they did for the
duties of war. About 500 W.A.N.S. met
in the State ballroom in a sort of fare-
well to arms, and there were happy re-
unions, for many of the girls busy in
different branches of the Services had not
met for some years.
Wherever she goes in Australia Mrs.
Goossens is noted for her smart hats and
sleek furs. She is the wife of visiting
conductor Eugene Goossens, who is in
this country with the A.B.C.
Cyril Ritchard and Madge Elliott are
sure draws. Whenever they are an-
nounced as the guests of honor, there the
multitudes gather. Bees could not have
gathered thicker in a field of asphodel
than did the members of the Women
Writers cluster in History House last
Thursday. In numbers it was prac-
tically a runner-up to the Bucking-
ham Palace garden party, and the
long, narrow gallery on the first
floor buzzed with excitement. The
Women Writers used to sit down for their
lunches. Now the lunch is a sort of
movable feast with fine sleight-of-hand
work at the buffet. With practice you
learn to hole in one, a plate of sand-
wiches and one of meat balls.
Madge and Cyril weren’t asked to stand
and juggle. "They sat completely sur-
rounded by committee members. They
looked amiable and well-groomed lions,
and Madge’s grace of figure was much
commented on. Later in the smaller
drawing-room the whole company sat on
chairs, the floor, or just stood while the
Women Writers’ president, the Countess
de Vilme-Hautmente, made speech of
welcome, and Cyril replied. His was
quite a neat little sermon on using the
pen to the further glory of Australia.
One listener at least felt like a small girl
in Sunday school being exhorted by the
Bishop. Then he gave unstinted praise
to Australia’s Bobbie Helpmann, and
told a funny story about Madge’s asking
the waiter at a very plush London restaur-
ant to wrap up the two pieces of roast
beef left on the platter “for her little
dog.” When they left the restaurant
Cyril said “In a time like this why did
you ask for the meat for your dog? Any-
way, you know the dog gets horseflesh.”
Madge gave him a look—“ This meat isn’t
for the dog. It’s for us.”
Todd Duncan’s superb singing drew an-
other packed Town Hall last Wednesday.
Plus the fine voice and the mastery of
his art Todd brings great variety of
approach to his programme. The mood
not only of the music but of the man
completely changes with each work. Here
is a singer who loves the words he is
uttering. His accompanist William Allen
also comes in for rounds of applause.
Wednesday night’s concert was one of
those when men call “Bravo!” and
women take their gloves off to applaud.
There was a sigh of almost envy when
Mr. Duncan sang the spiritual “Ah Got
Shoes.” It hit home. How many of his
listeners had walked not over Heaven but
over Sydney looking for footwear in the
recent, and maybe still upon us, footwear
famine? Star events of the programme
for this listener were the Figaro aria and
the opening Handel group.
If you are film-minded you will watch
your session and drop into Federation
Hall in Phillip-street (it’s the hall*at the
top of Federation House) next Thursday
night in time for the color pictures, the
work of Norman Chaffer. These show,
in a blaze of color and in the delicate
shades of bushland deeps, the bird and
animal life of this continent. They are
all prize films, and Mr. Chaffer has shown
them in soldier camps and hospitals. If
you are a lover of music only, then you
will pick the time for a programme by
those clever musicians and singers Mar-
jorie Hesse, Lily Kolos and John
Cameron. If you are wise you will just
go along and enjoy the whole Bill to-
morrow night, July 18. Alice Prowse and
Gladys Hart have organised the show to
aid the Food for Britain appeal. Painter
Clare Pitman is giving a picture for a
lucky-number competition.
Actor John Woods was married with-
out fuss or feather in Melbourne about
a fortnight ago. His wife is an English
girl whom John knew in pre-war days.
Her name was Phyl Buchanan. Last
week the two flew up from Melbourne on
Sunday to pay a short visit to John’s
father, who has been ill. They flew back
on Monday in time for John to appear
as Lachie in “The Hasty Heart.”
There is probably no better-liked nru??i
than Hugh McCrae and Australia holds no
better poet; so when news of his marriage
came last week there was a tidal wave of
good wishes sent out to him and his bride.
She was Mrs. Horace Keats. Musician to
his finger-tips Horace composed the
music for many of Chris Brennan’s poems
and Hugh’s lovely lyrics.
The lines of the invitation strode along
on sturdy feet. Thelma Foster was prob-
ably subtly reminding her guests they
probably would have to walk to the
rendezvous when she issued her come-
hithers in verse. Occasion was husband
Roland’s birthday. This was last Sunday,
July 14, and to the cliff-side dwelling of
Sydney’s popular singing teacher, painters,
singers, musicians, admirals (at least one)
£nd administrators, Consuls, doctors,
writers of books and of paragraphs
climbed gaily and gamely. The only
place ladies in bright plumage were not
sitting was on the chandelier —there was
none. Mrs. Foster’s frock was the shade
of deep-blue hyacinths.
Mrs. Norman McLeod’s hat made rest-
ing place for two waterlilies —no more,
no less. Mrs. Lorenz’s tiny hat, with its
short and buoyant veil, also suggested a
milliner with a soul above standardisa-
tion. Baritone Ron Jackson, just back
from a concert tour in China, talked
Hong Kong to Florence Taylor, who,
before the war, wrote a book on that
alluring spot. The Harald Bowdens came
with the Lashmars and Hector Bolitho,
who renewed old friendship with Angus
and Robertson’s Mr. Jeffrey. The George
Mackaness couple were there, the Walter
Macnicols, Admiral Feakes and his wife.
Painter Russell Drysdale’s mother and
sister Michelene have arrived in Sydney,
after all the war years spent in England.
Both mother and daughter were actively
engaged doing war work. They were
attached to the Women’s Voluntary Ser-
vices. To hear Mrs. Drysdale’s quiet
voice telling of the needs of the English
people makes the listener blush for the
captiousness often displayed towards our
own slightly curtailed menus. Mrs.
Drysdale speaks for the little people—the
people like railwaymen and baggage
carters, and the paper seller at the comer,
the ones who have no friends or relations
in the Dominions who might sometimes
brighten their lives with a parcel from
overseas, an individual parcel.
Hector Bolitho sailed off from his Auck-
land home in the between-the-wars years
with his courage and a presentation foun-
tain-pen to make his mark on Sydney and
then London. Hector’s big hit has been in
biography. He has done lives of noted
men and women. Painter Sydney Ure
Smith says his book on the Batsford
publishing concern is a blue-ribbon job.
As well as writing and lecturing
Hector has done six years’ work with
the R.A.F., not one" of the lads
who dropped the bombs or engaged
in duels in the air, but a very necessary
job all the same. He’ll tell you all about
that in his lectures, the first of which is
on the 30th of this month. He came to
Sydney by way of America and Auck-
land, where he and his mother had a
great reunion. He goes back to New
York from here, once more lecturing.
But this time there will be no magnetic
Roosevelt to summon him to the White
House. Maybe Hector will find time to
buy a new overcoat in the land of plenty.
He declares that the one he was wearing
the other evening is 14 years old.

Second-largest of its kind in Australia,
the business—pastoral, pastoral-finance,
wool- and stock-broking, agency and
merchandising—is well scattered through-
out the Commonwealth, and keeps on
expanding. Four new branches were
opened in Westralia, two in Victoria and
one at Alice Springs last term. Nearly
half the wool handled is received in
N. S. Wales, where the co. also does most
of its livestock turnover and is a large
mnowner as well.
When the war upset the world’s old
trade channels, the British Government
bought the Australian wool clip at a flat
rate of 13.4 d. a pound until mid-1942,
when the figure was lifted to 15.4 d. to
help cover increased costs. The next
table shows what the contract was worth

Over the seven years to end June last
23,869,109 bales were appraised with only
minor delays, and the aggregate value
was £457,546,873 —one of the world’s
largest and most successful commercial
operations. The shrinkage of £4,411,457
in last season’s cheque was due to a
lighter clip, following the previous year’s
drought, which caused heavy stock losses.
The slip in G.M.’s own wool receipts
was 65,700 bales:

The effect on wool commissions was
largely offset by better earnings from the
co.’s own stations, from merchandise
sales and from stock and land commis-
sions—during the year 3,600,000-odd
sheep, 200,000-odd cattle and 110,000-
odd pigs were put under the hammer,
and land sales exceeded a million pounds.
The shrinkage in gross earnings from
all sources was only £6478:

* Includes surplus on realisation of investments.
A saving of £l3lO in outgoings left net
profit £5168 short of the previous year’s
at 5.3 p.c. on capital, compared with
5.5, 8.2, 6.1, 5.5, 7.4 and 8.2 p.c. back
to 1940. On shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined) the net result was
only 3 p.c. The div. was kept at 5£ p.c.,
making an average of 6.1 p.c. over the
last decade.
As for the outlook, a better season is
in prospect. The British wool contract
ran out at end last month, and, for the
first time since 1939, auctions will be
resumed in September next. The new
stabilisation plan aims at marketing
current clips, together with portion of
accumulated war-time stocks, without
seriously disturbing prices for the staple.
The basic price for the current season
has been fixed at 18.15 d. a pound, less
a contributory charge of 5 p.c. (0.91 d.),
or 17.24 d. net. Minimum reserve prices
will be governed by a new table of limits
for the hundreds of different types of
wool based on the basic figure of 18.15 d.
If offers fail to reach the reserve figure
for a particular type, the wool will be
taken by Joint Organisation at the official
reserve. Owners have the right to put
their own reserve on their own wool, and
to withdraw any lot from sale if the
price is considered inadequate. Though
British and Continental mills are not yet
fully into their stride again, and Ger-
many and Japan are out of the market,
a strong demand for sound, well-grown
wools is anticipated, especially for the
finer types of merino and comeback.
These are expected to command a pre-
mium over reserve limits. Not until the
world’s most pressing post-war needs are
satisfied will the new wool-stabilisation
scheme be really put to the test. Mean-
while, the Australian grower will be en-
gaged mainly in a war against rising costs,
against which he has no offset within his
own control.

A surprisingly good result. The busi-
ness—engineering and electrical supplies,
lubricants and various hardware lines —is
spread throughout the Commonwealth.]
War and the mechanisation of the force#
gave the co.’s Stock-in-trade and its over-
seas connections a new importance. Our
own and Allied service demands sent
turnover to new high levels; so, despite
rising costs, including taxation, net earn-
ings got a nice lift. For the five years to
the close of accounts in 1945 they aver-
aged £36,093, compared with an average
of £30,620 for the preceding quinquen-
nium. For 15 years before that those
in the engineering and ancillary trades
had to face a combination of high costs
and severe competition, especially from
cheap-labor countries, which culminated
in slump in the early 1930’5, and the co.
jettisoned £70,500 of capital. That put
the business on an even keel, and very
encouraging progress was made before
war began.
Last term the demand for new machin-
ery, especially electric motors, spares, etc.,
to replace or repair what was worn out
during the war and to meet new needs,
more than filled the gap caused by evapo-
ration of service requirements. After
allowing for taxation and contingencies
and striking off £3593 (down £694) for
depreciation of plant, and including £lOl5
dropped from somewhere into reserves,
the net result was £3861 stronger at
£41,821. That covered the pref. div. and
16.3 p.c. on the £245,000 of ord. capital,
compared with 14.7, 15.7, 15.6, 15.6, 8.1,
13.1 and 13.2 p.c. back to 1939. The
div. was kept at 10.1 p.c. for the ninth
year in succession, and the £15,279 that
remained lifted reserves to £121,661.
The sudden leap in turnover on civilian
account is further reflected in the growth
of £107,010 in book debts:

Stocks increased by £41,125. To meet the
outlay the board added £25,745 to the
overdraft (£99,706) and £114,275 to the
amount coming to sundry creditors
(£261,200), which includes provision for
taxation, etc. The year’s improvement in
the more of less liquid surplus (£276,044)
was £15,377.
Still, when the books closed there was
18s. sd. of outside money at risk in the
business for every pound belonging to
shareholders. So, to consolidate the co.’s
position and provide for its post-war pro-
gramme, the board has decided to offer
150,000 new 14s. ords, at par, two for
five, to those on the register (prefs. and
ords.) on July 5. Applications for the
new issue, which has been underwritten
by A. W. Harvey <and Lowe (Sydney),
close on August 2. The market prices the
ords. at 18s. At that figure the net cost
to the investor, after exercising the rights
and allowing for brokerage, is approxi-
mately 17s. a share. The return at 17s.
is 8.4 p.c. so long as the 10.1 p.c. distri-
bution continues, or 4.8 p.c. should the
div. drop to 7 p.c. The prefs. at 295. 9d.
return 4.7 p.c. When the new issue is
fully subscribed and paid, net tangible
cover will be £l9 17s. 4d. prefs. and
20s. lOd. ords. The pref. div. and 10 p.c.
to the ords. will then call for £39,250, or
£2571 less than was netted last term.
Exactly what the future holds for the
co. it is difficult to say. At the moment
the economic background of international
trade is very fluid. Much will depend
upon what happens in U.S.A. Internally
demand promises to be strong until re-
conversion of the industrial structure is
complete and deferred domestic needs
are overtaken. After that the pressure of
supply is likely to express itself in keen
competition and price-paring. Cos. with
a sound financial structure and low costs
will fare best.

Since it curtailed its activities in the
then troublesome London marine market
over a decade ago, this stoutly-ribbed 83-
year-old Sydney-controlled fire, marine
and accident office hasn’t put much ginger
into the hunt for business outside Aus-
tralia and Maoriland. And, apart from
some inflated war-risk plums in the inter-
national marine, pie, it hasn’t missed
much.
War brought an increase in insurable
values, and in the volume of all classes
of business except motor-vehicle cover.
Gross premium receipts shot up from
£612,851 in 1939 to £831,337 in 1942.
They have come down by annual steps
since to £660,100 last term, when the drop
was £37,771. But less of the business was
reinsured, enabling the co. to show
£12,616 more net premium income:

Other features since war began have been
a marked recession in the loss rate, which
has been largely offset by a steady in-
crease in the cost of writing the busi-
ness. Last term’s loss rate (down 38s.
p.c.) was one of the most favorable in
the co.’s history. But the expense ratio
increased by 365. p.c., leaving the under-
writing surplus £1464 stronger at £41,961,
or 9.3 p.c. on capital. Interest and
rents brought in £25,436 net (down £343),
equal to 5.6 p.c. on capital, or a mere
2.4 p.c. on capital and reserves combined.
The net return from all sources was
£67,397 (up £1121), equal to 14.9 p.c. on
capital alone, compared with 14.7, 13.7,
13.5, 11.4, 10.4 and 12.8 p.c. back to
1939. The div. was kept at 10 p.c., and
it is doubtful whether better need be

The following are taken from several
similar communications received whilst
this announcement was being prepared.
The writers are discharged servicemen
who have got half way or further
through the Telman Course. * Our mail
each day contains many such apprecia-
tive references from service members and
civilians alike.
12th June, 1946.
“My wife advises me that nowadays I
appear to be more affable and in my work
I have noticed that at times I remember
little things which other people have not been
able to recall. This is a definite help, and
I feel that I am improving in all respects
as I progress with the Course.”
12th June, 1946.
“Since I began the Pelman Course I have
found a great improvement in myself gene-
rally. I have acquired the ability to make
decisions and have confidence in those decis-
ions. I have more confidence in myself and
I am more precise in the way I do things.”
24th June, 1946.
“I consider I have benefited greatly and I
intend, on the completion of this Course, and
when less adverse conditions prevail, to go
completely through the Lessons a second time
and carefully look for points which I may
have missed.”
24th June, 1946.
“My aim was social, moral and
gain. Have easily doubled social contacts/
Morally, have made good progress. Have
improved my employment situation and am
earning more than before starting your
Course. The Course is very helpful in my
other studies, even if only because of more
agile brain.”
24th June, 1946.
“I have definitely made advancements since
beginning the Course. I think I have
improved mainly in memory, though I have
improved in every subject so far touched on
in the Course.”
The utmost promptness marks the
Pelman Institute’s correspondence with
its members from the first inquiry to
completion of the Course.
The Headquarters of the Pelman
Institute are in London.
The Institute has bedn established in
Melbourne under the same direction for
over 38 years, and has enrolled more
than 60,000 of the half-million
Pelmanists.
What our senses do for us
A highly developed perceptive faculty recognises with little or no conscious
effort what is of use to its possessor: what is harmful, who is friendly and
who is indifferent or hostile, and what other people s interests, moods and
intentions are.
The Pelman Course of Training develops the perceptive faculties first.
In doing so there are many indirect effects which prepare the pupil for
other training which follows. The mind learns to think objectively, outside
and away from itself, and thus acquires new interests; self-confidence grows,
habits of will and concentration are formed; the ability to sift and sort
daily happenings into the mass of experience which is the basis of judgment
is developed; material for reflection and conversation is acquired; tact and
sensibility in the company of other people become habitual; and there is
a general quickening of the mind so that understanding of conditions and
people is easier.
These effects in part are felt in the early Lessons. They increase
with each Lesson and because there is observable growth—a conscious
unfolding of ability and power—the pupil is eager to proceed.
THE SERVICES: DISCHARGED OR SERVING. Members of the services
discharged or still serving are accepted at the reduced fee instituted m
the early war years. Enrolment maj be made direct with the I elman
Institute, under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme, or with
a Unit Education Officer.
CIVILIANS. The fee for the Pelman Course remains the same as
before the war. in spite of the many difficulties of the war years we
have maintained our full service and have made all our communications
to pupils as promptly as at any time in our history. The Institute has
in fact practised what it preaches, one text of which is that there are
few difficulties which, by foresight, judgment, initiative and the exercise
of the inventive faculty, cannot be overcome.

After sending £5OOO to the staff
fund, and writing £lO,OOO off the book
value of premises, £7397 of last year’s
earnings was put on the shelf, lifting
reserves £127,143 higher than paid
capital.
As for the current term, the sharp re-
duction in marine war-risk rates has been
partly offset by improvement in the
volume of merchant tonnage available
for ordinary trade purposes. With revival
of private and other building the volume
of fire premiums should strengthen, and
so should income from motor-vehicle
insurance, owing to the greater number of
cars, etc., on the road, following an in-
creased supply of petrol. And income
from these sources can be expected to
grow until supply overtakes accumulated
demand. Competition can be expected to
sharpen, which will make exes, difficult to
restrain. What will happen in connec-
tion with the loss ratio remains to be seen.
It is likely to rise in the accident section
as motor vehicles on the road grow in
number.
However, both policyholders and share-
holders are strongly protected, as the
following comparison of balance-sheet
figures shows:

This co., which turns out several popu-
lar lines of tinned vegetables and aspara-
gus—the last-mentioned is the line on
which the business grew up —is offering
92,000 new £1 ords. at a premium of 12s.
6d. each. Those on the register (prefs.
and ords.) at July 14 have priority as to
the first 55,000 of these shares; the
balance are available for general sub-
scription. The issue has been under-
written by R. V. Spier and Morell, Sydney
brokers, at 6d. a share. Applications
close July 31. On the market the ords.
are jammed at the ceiling price of 425.,
at which figure the return is 3.8 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis. On the same div. basis
the return at 325. 6d. is a shade over
5 p.c. On the basis of figures at end
June, 1945, and when the new shares are
fully subscribed and paid, net tangible
cover will be £6 16s. Bd. prefs. and 275.
9d. ords.
The new share (£92,000) and premium
(£57,500) moneys are to be used £30,000
for repayment of a special advance from
the Commonwealth Bank, £117,200 for
additional plant and equipment at the
Bathurst and Cowra canneries, and £2300
to cover brokerage.
When the new issue is fully subscribed
and all the money in, paid capital will be

in 60,000 6j p.c. cum. prefs. and 252,000

Accounts for the year to June 30 last are
not yet available. Concerning the heavy
provision for taxation in 1945 the chair-
man says:—
With the appropriation of £34,794 our
provision for taxation now stands at
£35,000, sufficient to cover all assessment's
of past and current years, including an
assessment of £7893 in June of this year
in respect of undistributed profits tax for
the year 1942-43. In an attempt to lighten
the burden of undistributed profits taxes,
owing mainly to delay in receiving assess-
ments, the management made a payment
of £7500 in June, 1943. The Taxation
Commissioner, however, has disregarded
this, amount as part of the “taxes paid” in
that year, thus resulting in heavier assess-
ment. ,
A liberal £28,554 (= 5 p.c. on land and
buildings and 20 p.c. on plant) was
allowed for depreciation. And during
the current (1946-47) term there will be
£117,200 of new capital share premium
money at work in the business. Appear-
ances are, therefore, that 8 p.c. on the
£252,000 of ord. capital should not prove
a difficult matter, especially as turnover
has continued on the up-grade since June
30, 1945.

SUNDRY SHOWS
LIVELY WATERCOLORS.
Frank McNamara’s watercolors (Gros-
venor Galleries, Sydney) show an original
and lively talent wrestling for expression:
the opponents being, as always, the diffi-
culties of the medium and the repressive
effect of contemporary fashions.
McNamara was seen at his best in a
striking impression of a stormy sea beat-
ing up on a promenade, bought by the
N. S. Wales Gallery out of the last Water-
color Institute exhibition. Later, in the
Wynne competition, he showed another
sea-piece—an oil—which was turgid and
mannered.
He has nothing as good as the Gallery
watercolor iri the present show. Two
representations of the same subject look
like rehearsals for the one that succeeded.
They are fresh and vigorous, with the
real tang of the sea about them, but the
hit-or-miss method practically necessitated
by the theme has here just missed.
Among the other paintings there is
one oil—a slum scene—influenced by
some Sydney “modernists,” ignoring all
light values and offering a smeary and
impossible sky of dark green. “Victorian
Harvest,” a watercolor, seems in its pat-
terned effect, its coldness and unreality
to reflect the influence of Kenneth Mac-
Queen. Other paintings are thin and
inky; and nearly all the skies look like
mere afterthoughts—meaningless spaces
and smudges.
When he is free from contemporary in-
fluences, as in “Allyn River” and “Even-
ing, Kiama,” NcNamara paints the earth
with fidelity and animation. Some of the
paintings are hardly more than tinted
drawings which—if one misses the rich,
full washes of Heysen, Blamire Young or
Flilder nevertheless demonstrate the
fundamental sincerity of the artist’s pur-
pose: a respect for the particularities of
the subject. The show as a whole is
sketchy, but forceful —it’s not everyone
these days who will tackle a stormy sea.
.*Jc * * *
Six of the pictures in Ernest Buck-
master’s show at Melbourne Athenaeum
are from 16 Singapore paintings done for
the Australian War Memorial. Buck-
master painted the 16 in just that many
days. This breathless speed of operation
would imply scamped work in other
artists, but Buckmaster is in the Bernard
Halt tradition, has a formula he applies
without misgivings and with skill, and
there is no observable difference in quality
between his commissioned work and the
canvasses he painted to please himself in-
stead of officials. There is a tendency to
matter-of-factness in some of his larger
pictures, but two are softer and more
persuasive—“The Sinking Sun’s Fare-
well” and “When Evening Claims the
Valley.”
* * * ' *
At the twenty-first annual exhibition of
the Contemporary Group at Farmers’
Blaxland Galleries, Sydney, S. Herman
had two red and horrified fish on a blue
plate, Grace Cossington Smith had a
number of paintings which resembled
mottled and motley Cezannes, and Ruth
Pasco’s “Autumn Ghost” demonstrated
very clearly what should not be done
when painting trees: the tree was pallid
and stricken, and the sky, as though in
sympathy, had turned green. And, to
cap it all, there were two “Constructive
Paintings,” one by Ralph Balson, the
other by Grace Crowley. The former
would have made a fairly good pattern
for a woman’s skirt, but the latter was
more obscure. Rachel Roxburgh’s “Por-
trait of Michael” was more promising.
It showed the head of a boy against a
background of hill and field. The hair
and eye§, were good and characteristic,
and the cheeks had the flush of health.
Something of the color of the country-
side was reflected in the portrait. Over-
simplification, both of design and color-
ing, made it fail in its total statement.
A Fine "St. Joan."
Having seen dozens of Shaw’s plays
performed by amateurs and professionals,
from Gregan McMahon to Sybil Thorn-
dyke and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the
present writer has no hesitation in assert-
ing that he has never seen Shaw done
better than “St. Joan” was by Melbourne
University D.C. and its outside helpers
at the Union Theatre under Max Nichol-
son’s direction.
Mr. Nicholson elected to produce the
play in modern dress, and very wisely.
Shaw’s idea is so absorbing that the
apparition of the Maid in a print dress
and the Earl of Warwick in a sac suit
didn’t destroy the illusion. Of course
modern ecclesiastical vestments are much
as they were in Joan’s day.
It is almost superfluous to particularise
the actors, but Judith Attiwill’s Maid was
supremely well tackled. As the bullied
Dauphin John Fitchett, dressed like a
Sydney Rocks larrikin, made that reac-
tionary youngster into a sympathetic
figure; Wynn Roberts was excellent as
Dunois, and Lloyd Thompson, Robert
Caldwell and Max Marginson, the ecclesi-
astics, kept the interest focussed on some
of the longest speeches in contemporary
drama. As the chaplain who wants Joan
burnt, not because she is a rebel against
the Church, but because she has insulted
England, and is completely destroyed
when he sees the actual execution, Frank
Tait was first-class. Bruce Anderson’s
Warwick was richly worldly.
More Todd Duncan.
Independent of Todd Duncan’s quality
as a singer he is an artist —a dramatic
artist —and it is fascinating to watch him
in those songs which best suit his own
dramatic vein. At his Saturday night
recital at Sydney Town Hall the contrast
between “Zueignung,” with its melan-
choly, reiterated “Habe Dank,” and tlje
swaggering “Toreador” song was startling.
And Todd Duncan exploits this con-
trast to the full: holding those formidable
dramatic weapons of his, his eyes, in
check, as it were, to coincide with the
drop in his voice. Then, when the rollick-
ing refrain comes it is reinforced by gay
glances, sparkling with vitality: his face
lights, and his head gently undulates. For
the time he is Escamillo, and it is neces-
sary to look hard past the great concert
piano to discover whether a Latin crowd
is not, in reality, there too.
* * / * *
Unfamiliar sojigs by relatively un-
familiar composers had the audience
worried at Joan Hammond’s initial
concert at Melbourne Town Hall. Most
of the songs, moreover, dealt with some-
what sad subjects and the lack of
emotional contrasts added to the apparent
monotony of the recital. Miss Ham-
mond’s unconventional programme
showed her (justifiable) confidence in her-
self as an artist. Her voice, though not
of great volume, is rich and sensitive.
When she threw in by way of encore a
couple of her most popular recorded
numbers the whole house instantly
melted. It was a fascinating demonstra-
tion of how much memories and associa-
tions play their part in art appreciation.
* * * *
Returning to Australia as one of the
world’s greatest ’cello players, Edmund
Kurtz made his enormous instrument
dance through the almost continuous
melody and quiet flow of Elgar’s concerto
in E minor at the fourth of the Mel-
bourne Symphony Orchestra’s subscrip-
tion concerts at the Town Hall. His
performance showed why Toscanini
selected him as soloist in one of his last
concerts. Professor Heinze was at the
top of his form in the Bach-Wciner
Toccata and in the laughing Beethoven
Fourth Symphony was responsive to every
change of mood.

Efforts are being made in Sydney to
re-form the Mosman Musical Society,
which was disbanded in 1941, owing to
the war. A meeting of former subscribers
and members is to be called and it is
hoped to have a musical comedy under
way by Christmas.
At the Talkies
Either as a reflection of a neurotic age,
or as a deliberate attempt to cash in on
current obsessions, the film business seems
to have been badly bitten and infected
by the psychiatry bug. At least three
recent “major productions” have been
given over to the subject, and in dozens
of “supports” the fingerprint sleuth is
making way for the psychiatrist; schizo-
phrenia has become an effective substitute
for Dr. Jekyll’s potion ; while obsessions,
repressions, associations, and suchlike are
ousting the old bloodstains, missing docu-
ments and other hidden clues.
At present it has the interest of novelty,
and the awful possibility of drama degen-
erating from the depiction of inevitable
results of human passions to a technical
dissection of the human mind seems re-
mote—Rosalind Russell, as a female psy-
chiatrist in “She Wouldn’t Say Yes”
(Victory), is forced to retract an icy,
passionless analysis of love and retreat to
proving the accepted Hollywood version.
Ingrid Bergmann makes much the same
retreat in “Spellbound,” Sydney Regent’s
current show. As a very scientific and un-
emotional psychiatrist in an aslyum— or
sanatorium—she falls, practically on
sight, for the new principal of the institu-
tion. That gentleman turns out to be a
masquerader suffering from amnesia and
the conviction that he has murdered the
genuine (and missing) principal, but Miss
Bergmann, guided by very unscientific in-
stinct, believes him innocent and diag-
noses his complaint as a “guilt complex.”
The mystery is carefully unravelled by
means known to criminology and psy-
chiatry, including the analysis of an
elaborate dream sequence—designed by
Salvador Dali.
Miss Bergmann is never extended to
cope with her role ; Gregory Peck is the
fear-ridden young man ; and the whole
opus, under the able direction of Alfred
Hitchcock, is threaded with' sustained
mystery and suspense.
Also on the Regent’s current bill is the
fine technicolor short of London’s Victory
Day celebrations (reviewed B. 3/7/’46),
an interesting and beautiful technicolor
dissertation on golden Palomino horses;
and a diverting Disney report of the latest
escapades of the hound Goofy.
After his role as a chronic alcoholic
in “The Lost Week-End,” Ray Milland
is still chasing the bottle in “The Well-
Groomed Bride” (Tatler). This time, how-
ever, it’s the last magnum of French
champagne in San Francisco, which
makes a pleasant light comedy.
The going is a little heavier in “To-
morrow is Forever” at Sydney Century.
Claudette Colbert loses her husband in the
1914-18 war, bears his son posthumously,
marries George Brent and settles con-
tentedly into an extremely comfortable
existence. Her earlier loss is suddenly
revived by the will of her son to enlist in
the R.A.F., a situation complicated by the
reappearance of her first husband, who,
after hiding his war-inflicted deformities
in anonymity in Europe, is driven from
that sanctuary by the Nazis. Orson
Welles is the missing husband, who turns
up again in the guise of a bearded
Austrian chemist, and he shows every
sign of enjoying the role' immensely.
There are flashes of excellent acting, some
muddled philosophising and a good deal
of high melodrama.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Two things that remain standing wonders,
ihough as old as the hills or thereabouts,
■cropped up on.ce more in the Grand National
Steeplechase at Flemington on Saturday: (1)
the regularity with which whatever gods look
after them come to the rescue of the books
whenever a double of favorites looks all set
to come home; and (2) the unshakable
courage, or whatever it is, of Melbourne
punters where the leaping neddies are concerned.
Solvent having won the first leg of the
Nationals double, Tente made it look as if
for once the doubles books were in for a
heavy payout. There is not a better ’chaser
racing here than the old gelding by Devon-
shire-Tente Encore. As a 10-year-old he’s no
more a chicken than the sort shops sell
at' Christmas, but at any rate he is one com-
pared to many in the last English Grand
National field, whose ages ranged up to 14.
He proved himself a stayer by winning last
year’s Australian Steeple, and he showed both
his form for the National and his liking for
the track by winning two good Steeples at
Flemington last month. For one of those
wins he copped a 61b. penalty, and as he was
beaten by only a length and a half in the
National, being run down over the last bit
when he looked to have it won, that extra
poundage was his undoing.
As against Tente’s excellent credentials, the
winner, High Flash, a six-year-old Marconi-
gram gelding, had none whatever, and was
down at the bottom of the weights with 9.4,
though he carried 31b. over. As things have
happened, however, the age of the winner
might be rated as at least one sort of cre-
dential. In the National Hurdle a week
earlier all three placegetters were sixy-year-
olds, and another winner over the hurdles
that day was also of that age. Moreover, both
Gyrone and Accelerate, respective winners of
the other two jumping events last Saturday,
are also six-year-olds.
As for the hardihood of the punters, the
National Steeple course is three miles and
a furlong with 25 fences to jump, among
them Jumbo, a standing monument to crashed
fancies and torn-up betting tickets. Despite
all this, the betting on Saturday was threes
Tente, fives Lashio, sixes Leicester Square,
sevens Jocularity and Walladale. Of this lot,
lashio and Leicester Square fell and Walla-
dale lost his rider. Moreover, Tente was the
only one of them that returned so much as
a tote dividend (10s.; that is, even money).
Yet those odds can be regarded as extrava-
gantly generous. In the Doutta Galla Hurdle
it was 11 to 8 Buzharine, and Buzharine
finished last, while in the Footscray Steeple
the favorite was Barncluith at 9 to 4, and
Barncluit'h was among more than half the field
that failed to complete the course. By way
of curious contrast, there were four fiat races
on Saturday’s Flemington bill and • the favor-
ites in three of them were at 4 to 1. The
fact that none of these favorites won, either,
doesn’t make the cramped odds they’re pre-
pared to take about the jumpers any the. less
remarkable.
No doubt what it all boils down to is a
readiness to pay for entertainment, and the
National Steeple had its usual quota of that
quality. The baby of the field, the four-year
old South Australian contender Lashio —
he’ll be a grand ’chaser when he acquires a
bit more cunning—pulled his way early to
the front, and was out about five lengths
carting them along in dashing style when he
toppled over Jumbo. That left Hearsay and
Walladale in front, with Tente nicely placed.
When they came round to Jumbo again Walla-
dale was leading Tente, but it was there
Walladale lost' his rider, leaving Tente to lead
earlier than G. Sholl probably desired. Still,
he stuck it out well, and had charge over the
last jump, .but in the run home the lightly-
weighted High Flash, who had been moving
up steadily over the last mile, gradually wore
him down. Quixotic was third, four lengths
behind Tente.
High Flash was ridden a nice race by the
South Australian cross-country rider E.
Wilson; a conclusive enough answer to those
who’d been criticising him since he came over.
He also rode Gyrone to a comfortable win
from Camouflage and The Feline in the
Doutta Galla Hurdle. The other jumping
event, the Footscray Steeple, was most not-
able for the margins by which Accelerate beat
Autocles and Giantess; officially, half a fur-
long, and three lengths.
Two big fields turned out for the divided
Lawn Handicap (six furlongs), Dual Gift
downing the unlucky Enthuse and Kind Link
in the first division, and in the other Wonder
Bird at long last getting there, with Geronimo
and Reperio in the places. By St'. Magnus,
Geronimo looks more the makings of a good
horse at every run. Stenelaus easily accounted
for Skyway, Arduli and the other distance
performers in the 12-furlongs Winter Handi-
cap, and Despatch Rider (a Kinderscout geld-
ing) defeated Rossfield, Cyclotron and the rest
in the Two-year-old Mile, Adrian finding his
9.1 top weight too great a burden.
* * * *
The ex-Melbourne horse Codicil may be a
useful addition to the ranks of middle-dis-
tance gallopers in Sydney, where he has won
at his only two starts —a nine-furlongs Welter,
and, on Saturday at Canterbury, the S.T.C.
Handicap of 11 furlongs. With only seven
starters, and old Shining Night topweight at'
8.8, giving the winner 41b., Codicil didn’t
beat much, but he beat them pointlessly.
Buzz Off - and Flying Cloud were cutting at
each other from the start t‘o the home turn,
where Flying Cloud weakened, leaving Buzz
Off going nicely in front. Then Williams
got to work on Codicil, winning by four
lengths. Pocketed on the rails, Shininq Night,
who started favorite, had to drop back and
“ What’s par on this course, Peabody?"
come round the field, but rattled home well
enough to beat Buzz Off for second money.
Codicil is a five-year-old gelding by the fine
stayer Enfield, the sire’s wins in England in-
cluding the Newmarket Cesarewitch (two and
a quarter miles) and the Queen Alexandra
Stakes over two and three-quarter miles.
Betting on the Flying, with five horses at
between 4 to 1 and 5 to 1, suggested an ex-
ceptionally open race, but from the moment
he really started moving, three furlongs from
home, the topweight and favorite, Victory
Lad, dominated the field, Cook bringing him
along with a fine sustained run to win by
a little more than a length. Earl Pentheus
finished smartly for second money, and the
promising Nuffield three-year-old Gallant Law
showed plenty of dash, just failing to oust
Chantilly from third place.
Victory Lad, a four-year-old entire by Brue-
ghel from the Marconigram mare Chanson,
struck great form in Brisbane, and the Can-
terbury win was his fourth from his last
five starts. Carrying 9.4, he was conceding
the others 151 b. and upward, but cut out the
six furlongs in 1.13 L Earlier in the day
November, downing unlucky Photinia and
Beautiful in the two-year-old fillies race, took
1.16 for the same journey.
Yet' another of the season’s Payten-trained
youngsters ridden by A. Mulley, the Golden
Sovereign colt Raleigh, won the seven-and-a-
quarter furlongs Two-year-old Handicap (colts
and geldings). Raleigh finished stoutly to get
there narrowly from Double Mint and Clipper.
Having won at two successive starts in winter
company, Raleigh is, of course, now being
hailed as a Derby hope. He might get staying
ability from his dam, the Pantheon mare Vir-
ginia, but few of the Golden Sovereigns
have as yet shown much liking for distance.
Mulley made it a double for the day and
raised his season’s total to 57 winners by taking
the first division of the Welter on the Fresco
gelding Oliver, with Fine Art and Cisco in
the places. Thompson also rode a winning
double, the first leg of it Komadil, a Picca-
dilly gelding racing in the same interests as ,
Oliver. In the nine-furlongs Novice Sonning-''
attempted to lead all the way, but was joined
by Komadil inside the distance and fairly out-
stayed, both carrying the same weight; third
place went to Binnia Lassie. Later Thompson
had the winning mount in the second division
of the Welter, riding El Grandee, a maiden
three-year-old, who finished too well for even-
money favorite Young Veilmond and second
favorite Steadfast.

Of the 100,000-odd who turned out to
watch the V.F.L. games on Saturday,
60,000 were evenly divided as to the
match of the day, half choosing Essendon-
Footscray, the other half Carlton-South
Melbourne. Both lots got their money’s
worth. At Essendon there were three
quarters of brilliant football —long kicks,
flying marks, the ball flashing from end
to end. Footscray excels in this sort of
play and by accurate kicking led into the
last quarter, when the ’Dons, 10 points
down, crowded the play, killed Foots-
cray’s open game and kicked 5.10 to 0.2,
to win 16.24-14.8. At Carlton it was fast
and clever, with South doing the bustling
and Carlton keeping it open. A minute
before the bell the scores were level,
Turner (Carlton) got a free and kicked the
winning point: Carlton 12.13; South
11.18. Amidst all this excitement
Collingwood quietly dished Hawthorn,
15.23-11.14; Richmond (14.14) chewed
its way tihrough Fitzroy (10.12);
North politely polished off St. Kilda,
12.11-10.14; and Melbourne moodily
mauled Geelong, 21.14-15.7.
University Rugby Union team has suf-
fered heavily in casualties this season, but
its scratch side played and tackled hard
and with a bit of luck might have beaten
the all-conquering Randwick. A last-
minute burst by winger Slattery got the
’Wicks a try and gave them their eleventh
successive victory, 20-16. After a calm
first half, Saints and Parramatta played
fast football in the second, Schomberg’s
kicking—he was in good form—gaining
the laurels for “Parra,” 15-11. With State
centre Allan ripping through North’s de-
fences at will, Gordon registered a com-
fortable 26-11 win. Other games: East
11, Drummoyne nil; Manly 17, West 3.
Randwick is on top, four points ahead of
East, with Manly third and Uni. fourth.

Pails had an easy win in the Irish lawn
tennis championships, defeating * local
Davis Cup player Cyril Kemp, 6-1, 6-2,
6-3. Easy wins against weak opposition
aren’t going to improve either his tennis
or his will-to-win when the going is
tough ; both were lacking at Wimbledon.
With Brown, Pails also won the doubles
in Ireland, downing J. S. Olliff
and the British player Mottram,
6-1, 6-2, 6-3.

One pretty solid explanation
of late world heavyweight cham-
pion Jack Johnson’s ring tough-
ness was discovered by X-ray—
a skull from half to threequarters
of an inch thick; “comparing
favorably,” said the medical re-
port, “with the skull of an ox.”
The records list 109 fights for
Johnson. He won 69 of his 80
decision scraps, 37 of them by
k.o. He lost three decision fights,
one of them on a foul, and was
knocked out eight times. Asked
in 1914 to leave London, where he
was doing the music halls, Johnson fled to
Spain and there and in Mexico took to
bullfighting to keep himself in funds. The
records don’t say whether he beat the
bulls by butting.

Dick, Harris had so many physical ad-
vantages over Norm Richards at Leich-
hardt—it looked a case of middleweight
v. lightweight—that ringsiders expected
an early finish. But •’Richards was the
aggressor most of the time, and was going
strong in the 12th and last round. He
was really entitled to the decision, but
the referee voted it a draw.
Regarded by supporters as another Vic
Patrick —he is a southpaw, anyway—Roy
Treasure boxed Jackie Wilson at Sydney
and was another unlucky party to a split
verdict. Wilson’s greater experience and
cleaner punching won him four or five
rounds, but Treasure was superior in the
others. Ken Bailey gave Joe Grant a
beating in the main bout, also over 12
rounds, and here the decision was never
in doubt.

Taxes and Spending
The promised Chifley tax reductions
have been announced. Broadly, they
follow the well-known Labor Government
recipe: Last to contribute, first to get
relief—though some tax still reaches
down to incomes of £lO4 a year.
A taxpayer, single, on £350 a year
gets a reduction of 15.5 p.c. on the rates
brought in on January 1 this year, making
a total cut of 28 p.c. An unmarried reci-
pient of £2OOO a year, personal exertion,
will now get a cut of 9 p.c., making 19.2
p.c. in all; he will still pay 7s. 9d. in the
£, against the other man’s 3s. Id. A
taxpayer on £lOOO a year will still be
liable for ss. 6d. in the £, even though
he now gets a cut of 12.3 p.c., making a
total of 23.1 p.c. since the end of the
war. Among the higher-income brackets,
the person collecting £5OOO from per-
sonal exertion will be allowed to retain
£2056 of it, paying 11s. 9d. in the £
tax ; out of £5OOO of property income
only £lBO5 will remain with the taxpayer,
taxes taking 12s. lOd. in the £. Total
relief in this category since the end of
the war has been 16.6 p.c., against 28 p.c.
in the case of a £350 property income.
On incomes between £5OO and £l5OO
the person dependent upon dividends,
rents, interest, etc., pays about p.c.
more tax than the wage- or salary-earner.
The new rates will operate from July 1.
On incomes of between £250 and £lOOO
a year the two cuts, compared with the
highest war-time rates, represent a reduc-
tion of about 25 p.c. In higher tax groups
the relief is much lower. A new method
of assessing the social services contribu-
tion has been introduced, the rate rising
from 3d. in the £ to a maximum of Is. 6d.
in the £. This contribution is included
in the foregoing rates of taxes. Some
concessions, amounting to increased ex-
emptions, favor small incomes.
In spite of the 6| p.c. reduction in
1945-46 income tax rates, Commonwealth
collections last year were £lBl million,
after allowing for £33 million refunded
to the States. This was only about a
million less than in the preceding year, in
which a big “pay-as-you-go” impost was
collected. Mr. Chifley says the present
tax cuts will cost revenue £17.5 million.
The “12| p.c.” cut made in January last
was estimated to cost nearly £lO million
in the six months ; actually, from one
source and another, the Treasury col-
lected little less than before. The total
tax burden on Australians appears likely
to be at least £45 a head in 1946-47.
No relief whatsoever has been granted
to companies since the highest tax rates
of war-time were imposed. Double-
taxation of shareholders continues.
Pension rates and conditions are being
“liberalised” in a way that will allow
50,000 pensioners drawing a separate in-
come to increase their pension and will
bring an additional 90,000 pensioners into
the field. The proposal is estimated to
cost £4.5 million a year. Permissible in-
come without reduction of pension is be-
ing raised from 12s. 6d. to 20s. a week,
and permissible property, other than a
home, is being raised from £4OO to £650.
The Government, even in the hardest days
of the war, was intensely preoccupied
with the economics—and politics—of old-
age pensioners.
Pensions and other forms of “social
security” are responsible for a large por-
tion of our post-war taxes.
Mr. Chifley says that total “war” ex-
penditure was £378 million in 1945-46,
£lB million more than the Budget esti-
mate. He admits that Australian ex-
penditure was £42 million greater than
estimates, while overseas outgo was £24
million lower because of a delay by the
British Government in presenting its
account. A bill for £2O million is ex-
pected this year.
If this £2O million hangover applies to
1945-46, then “War’s” cost rises to £398
million. Furthermore, at least £42 mil-
lion appears to have been deducted in the
Chifley figure as a result of income from
disposals of surplus equipment and stores,
mainly bought in previous years. In
addition, £2B million was received earlier
in the year from Britain in respect of past
services rendered by the Commonwealth,
and there were credits from the
Division of Import Procurement relating
to other years. The true cost of “war” to
Australia last year was probably close on
£4BO million. Mr. Chifley’s figure, in any
case, is a gross understatement, and his
Budget estimate of £360 million was mis-
leading to the extent of at least £lOO
million —an error greater than a whole
pre-war Budget. That, however, doesn’t
seem to worry Mr. Chifley, except that he
is withholding his 1946-47 Budget, to-
gether with fuller details of 1945-46
accounts, until after the elections in Sep-
tember.
Subsidies of -various kinds, mainly
granted to keep prices down, totalled £33
million last year, and were charged to
“war.” This figure is expanding as in-
flationary pressure grows.-
The Bulletin has made frequent refer-
ence to Government mishandling of
coastal shipping. Before the war private
companies gave better service at a lower
cost and made a profit. The Government
never reveals its losses on shipping, but
it admits that shipping and merchant-ship
construction last year cost £7 million.
The item is ambiguous. *
The Government aims to reduce its
“war” expenditure by £l5O million this
year. In the absence of a precise figure
for 1945-46 it remains to be seen what
this promise is worth. An increase of
£45 million in civil outgo (£132 million
last year, apart from certain National
Welfare Fund charges) is forecast.
Mr. Chifley maintains that all borrow-
ings over the past two years have been
put up by the public. This is far from
the plain truth. Savings-bank deposits—
largely Commonwealth Savings Bank de-
posits—have been used on a very pro-
nounced scale.
Borrowings last year totalled £153
million, against an estimate of £152 mil-
lion, in spite of the fact that total revenue
was about £lB million greater than ex-
pectations. Non-war expenditure was in
keeping with estimates. In the present
year a continuance of “substantial” bor-
rowing is expected in order to meet the
deficit. Other loans will be raised for
“works,” etc., including £2O million for
housing projects.
War and “war” had cost Australia
£2489 million up to June 30. Though the
War is ended, “war” still goes on. And
the taxpayer certainly pays.
The Dollar Loan to Britain
The U.S. House of Representatives has
now followed the Senate in approving the
$4400 million loan to Britain, of which
$650 million will be used to wipe out
final lend-lease debits, leaving $3750 mil-
lion (£930 million sterling) as a “line of
credit” to be drawn on for the purchase
of present and future necessities from
America.. The loan carries interest at 2 p.c.
with a first payment in 1951. Annual
repayments must be made with interest
instalments, a final settlement being set
down for a.d. 2001. The approval of the
loan by Congress will release to Britain
proceeds of a Canadian loan on similar
terms, the granting of which was con-
tingent upon the approval of the U.S.
loan.
The creation of post-war indebtedness
between the U.S. and Britain to some
extent defeats the object of lend-lease,
but, as American politics stand, it is
doubtful if anything better could have
been achieved. There are many who
hope that it will not be necessary for
Britain to take up the whole “line of
credit”; but with U.S. prices on the
ascent it may be that the loan will buy
considerably less than its planners fore-
saw, thus calling for the spending of
every cent. Britain is in urgent need of
many essential commodities and much in-
dustrial machinery at the present time.
But its export trade in manufactured
goods is showing a fine recovery.
Acceptance of the loan by Britain im-
plies its adherence to the Bretton Woods
currency plans.
The A.W.A. Deal
The Federal Government has intro-
duced a bill to acquire the telecommuni-
cations services (including the Beam
system) from Amalgamated Wireless, and
has asked Parliament to give it an open
order for £3,000,000 to make the pur-
chase and do a deal with Cable and Wire-
less, Ltd., London. As is usual with the
Ministry’s handling of large sums, it has
proffered no details of the compensation
to be paid to A.W.A. shareholders, with
the result that the bill has met with
pointed criticism in the House. Mr.
Fadden claims he has been advised that
£1,500,000 or thereabouts is to be paid to
the holders of the 485,517 A.W.A. oi di-
nary shares not in the Government’s
name (it owns 500,001 shares and appoints
three of the seven directors), and his in-
formation has been close enough to have
drawn a protest from Mr. Calwell about
“improper access to confidential informa-
tion.”
It has been contended by Opposition
members that private shareholders will
get about £3 a share for the communica-
tions part of the A.W.A. business alone,
and they will retain their equity in the
large radio manufacturing end of the con-
cern, in which the Federal Government
will continue to have more than a half-
interest. Mr. Fadden contends that the
Government is paying £3 a share for half
the shares of half the company, making
these shares worth about £6 each, whereas
they could have been bought at 435. 6d.
in 1942, though the market was full of
buyers now at the ceiling price of 71s.
6d. set by the Treasury.
According to A.W.A. accounts made
up to June 30, 1945, the “wireless-ser-
vice” land, plant and Beam research
capitalised were valued at £933,000.
Patent rights, part of which might apply
to telecommunications, were valued at
£85,811, and shares in other companies
were in at £105,080. Some of the plant
and buildings devoted to wireless services
represented factories, not all of which
might be included in the deal with the
Federal Government. But the maximum
involved would appear to be about
£1,000,000 (book value) in total net assets
of £1,670,527, while the minimum might
be lower.
There were no dividends for A.W.A.
shareholders from 1922 until after the
Beam service opened in April, 1927.
Thereafter, helped considerably by the
development of domestic radio (the co.
controls 2CH, and is a large manufacturer
and licensee of radio materials and parts),
profits have been satisfactory. In 1944-45
they were equal to 14.5 p.c. on capital,
and a 10 p.c. dividend was paid.
One of the Government-sponsored
directors of A.W.A. is W. M. Hughes,
who has kept his place on the board in
spite of changes of Government. An-
other director is John Stewart, a Labor
M.L.C. in the N. S. Wales House. Chair-
man is T. J. Parker, of Huddart Parker.
Some of the larger “private” share-
holders in A.W.A., according to a recent
inspection of records, were:
Cable and Wireless, Ltd 149,667
Marconi’s I.M.C. Co. 42,666
Huddart Parker .. .. .. .. 39,155
Adelaide Steam .. .. .. .. 21,712
Australian Steamships .. .. .. 5,500
Bellambi Coal .. 1,000
Burns Philp 1,142
Mcllwraith McEachern .. .. 4,000
Melbourne Steamship .. .. .. 1,642
The Government’s cavalier treatment
of Parliament in withholding proposed
purchase details is open to criticism if not
censure. The bill is also inadequate in-
sofar as provision for operational details
after the Government commission takes
over telecommunications is concerned.
The Government spent hundreds of mil-
lions of pounds on blank cheque forms
granted by Parliament during the war,
when the need for secrecy as to war
preparations was understandable. But the
desire for secrecy in its dealings now is
reprehensible, particularly when consid-
ered in conjunction with the wholly in-
adequate details of Budget expenditure
that is still running into hundreds of mil-
lions of pounds a year.
It is hard to ascertain a true or reason-
able valuation for A.W.A. communica-
tions assets without a split-up of both
assets and earnings of each section of the
business, but if private shareholders are
assured of £3 a share in cash, plus reten-
tion of the radio-manufacturing (etc.)
part of the business, they appear to be
doing all right. Main complaint is against
the impudent secrecy maintained by the
Government over the deal. The acquisi-
tion itself is part of an Empire plan, en-
dorsed by the Bermuda Agreement, to
centralise control of all cable and wireless
communications that has been subject
to a measure of criticism in Britain.
Australian pig-iron output during Feb-
ruary, March and April was slightly above
the average rate established during the
three years to June, 1939. But it was far
below the increased capacity of the plant,
and only about two-thirds the level set
in 1941-42. The steel position is of the
same order. Australia, in trying to meet
local construction demands (including
home-building), and establish an export
trade to such countries as New Zealand
and the N.E.1., is finding itself thwarted
by deliberate Communist obstruction
among the labor forces. If Labor were
willing and unfettered by Communism
there is not the slightest doubt that this
country could be producing 50 p.c. more
steel than now and a great deal more
coal, with other production in propor-
tion. The present production depression
can truly be laid at the door of Labor in
its many guises and its strange bedfellows.
Never in Australia’s history has there ex-
isted a finer opportunity for increased,
profitable production.

“Planning” in Practice
From *j. F. Davidson:
World planning for the feeding of devastated
Europe appears to have upset plans for feeding
Britain. None of the “plans” seems to be
working • out well, anyway. It cannot be
claimed that there was not time enough to
plan properly. International representatives
went into conference on food at Hot Springs
in U.S.A. in 1943. In June, 1943, attention
was directed by Cornell University to the neces-
sity for keeping grain for humans. It was ex-
plained that the only way to feed humanity
properly was to reduce the number of grain-
consuming livestock in the U.S.A.
The supply position was fully disclosed by
August, 1945, when the harvests of the Nor-
thern Hemisphere were realised. Nothing un-
expected of magnitude occurred when the
Southern Hemisphere crop was measured up
at Christmas, 1945. In. October, 1945, British
Foreign Minister Bevin said pointedly in the
House of Commons: “I sh<puld like to see
much less wheat being fed to livestock in North
America.”
In spite of the stark accuracy of the informa-
tion the United States of America has gone
against advice and fed grain to animals exces-
sively. Although by January 1, 1946, it had
become clear' that more than half of the
season’s wheat supply was gone, more than
a hundred million bushels was fed to livestock
during January-March, an even higher rate than
during the first half of the season. This shock-
ing story is set forth in some detail in the
May circular of the National City Bank of
New York. It mentions also that'the livestock
population of U.S.A., instead of being reduced,
is actually 16 p.c. above the pre-war figure!
As a result, Britain has had to scrap its plans.
Turn from this and ponder on the League
of Nations, recently deceased. Another in-
stance of a grandiose scheme, brimming over
with good intentions. Its outstanding perform-
ances were two major disasters, both interna-
tional in character. The first was the world-
wide depression of 1930, a man-made strin-
gency arising from money-power and the bad
handling of high finance. It -was obviously not
the error of one nation. No country escaped ;
Australia was the first to find a way out of the
trouble —yet we suffered grievously. The second
was World War 11, the very thing the League
had set out to circumvent. Could failure be
more pronounced?
One wonders if planning in practice must
always follow this pattern when attempted on
too large a scale. Planning always has been
necessary in industry. In the old days the
people who did the planning were called, not
planners or organisers but clerks and managers.
They knew the details of their problems and
planned from the bottom up. The present
craze for planning from the top down may
provide attractive positions for a favored few,
but the results seem to be a mess more often
than not. It used to be a British belief that
a Government was wise to leave planning to
private enterprise; but nowadays planning is
not merely the toy of nations —it is an inter-
national plaything.
The National City Bank implies that price-
controls are at the root of the present grain
trouble. It draws attention to the fallibility of
controls and planning. There is no doubt that
fat American animals ate the grain that should
have been saved for human beings starving in
Europe in spite of oceans of “planning.”
Here in Australia we indulged in price-
faking for so many years before the war that
nobody can expect to see clearly enough to plan
wisely until subsidies are gradually removed,
rent controls relaxed and prices allowed to
find their natural level. These things cannot be
done in the twinkling of an eye, but the earlier
the start and the more vigorous the effort to
achieve freedom in these matters the sooner the
goal will be reached. It is the natural fluctua-
tions of prices that provides the normal link
between supply and demand. Unless we are
alert we shall find that elastic link, made rigid
in time of war to help the war effort, kept
rigid in time of peace by “planning” from Can-
berra.
Throughout Australia business of a
multitude of kinds is still held up be-
cause of lack of fuel, power, materials
and labor. The coal shortage, caused
by strikes and deliberate go-slow policy,
has the most far-reaching effect; it is
directly responsible for inadequate fuel
and power supplies, as well as for the
shortage of some essential raw materials,
such as steel. But, considering that many
industries are not working at capacity
because of these deficiencies, it is remark-
able to see that labor is not fully avail-
able in many other industries where only
labor has been lacking. The textile trades
are a case in point; here the shortage is
mainly of females, and, with muni-
tion plants closed down on all sides, one
would expect an abundance of women
and girls in the labor market. Since the
end of the Pacific war in August last the
fall in total female employment (excluding
domestics, rural workers and women in
uniform) has been only 3 p.c. (to the end
of March). The fall was rather greater
at Christmas season, but it has been
recovering, without great benefit to the
textile trades. Many clothing manufac-
turers and the like are setting up smaller
units of their plant in country centres,
w here the local lasses often prefer to
.. factnrv iob rather than milk
SUCK to a factory ]OD rainer man milK
COWS or pick peas. The labor position,
as a w hole, both male and female, has
by no means sorted itself out yet. One
j ~ • i
section of labor, deliberately unproduc-
tive, is causing other sections to be
thwarted from producing fully.

u . . . « D , .
, Prime Minister Chifley, m his Budget
estimates, anticipated a yield of £2B mil-
j|on f rom disposals of war equipment
-. c u n A
during 1945-46. Before the year ended it
was evident that this revenue would be at
least 50 p.c. greater than the estimate,
The money, as received, appears to be
offset against “war” expenditure ; cer-
tainly the estimated disposals revenue was
set off against estimated “war” expendi-
ture in the Budget figures. In spite of the
greater revenue available for offset pur-
poses, the actual net “war” expenditure to
May 31 was already £5 million in excess
of ,the estimate to June 30 (i.e., actual net
outgo for 11 months was £365 million,
against an estimate for 12 months of £360
million). There have been other credits
and windfalls offset against “war” expen-
diture, and, altogether, Mr. Chifley’s fore-
cast of £360 million last year was a piece
of gross deception. More correctly it
is; £365 million net to May 31, plus out-
lay for June, plus offsets from disposals,
plus recoveries from other Governments
of money spent in other years (some large
items), plus credits from the Division of
Import Procurement on its trading activi-
des; It may eventually be found that Mr.
Chifley s bald estimate of £360 million
mi . }° n s^°rt 11 °| J ru , • *
as 5e I f n at a ra in his
explanations about how expenditure has
exceeded estimates and how he has man-
a^, to disguise the position by fortuitous
credits. As Treasurer, Mr. Chifley is
demonstrably a political humbug.

The Australian woollen industry has
been so active during the war that even
Amalgamated Textiles has been able to
pay reasonable dividends since 1941. The
shares, previously reduced from £1 to
10s. 10d., are scarce at the ceiling price
of 12s. 9d. Last annual div. was 9£ p.c.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Blime”: Tubby was a hard buyer.
Sale after sale he followed, private offer-
ings he investigated, and still his acres
remained under-stocked. Then he ran
into “Baldhill” Sandy. “Gettin’ late in
the season for y’t’ get sheep now,” Sandy
pointed out, “ ’less y’ go away for ’em.
Local sales is all finished, an’ nobody’s got
any surplus. What sort y’ want?”
“Young ewes,” replied Tub, “but I’ll con-
sider any sort. Feed’s goin’t’ waste every-
where so, cripes, I got t’ do somethin’.”
“Tell y’ what,” Sandy suggested, “I got
three hundred crackers in me river pad-
dock I can’t handle. Y’ c’n have ’em for
nothin’, if they’re any good to y\” Tubby
thought it over. “Sounds reasonable,” he
agreed. “I’ll look at ’em, an’ let y’ know.”
That evening Sandy came on him inspec-
ting the old ewes in a corner near the
road. Tubby let go his latest catch, looked
through the mob carefully, then, whist-
ling his mong, strode across to the owner.
“Ain’t bad at the price, Sandy,” he
nodded shrewdly. “Most of ’em’ll rear
another lamb, so I’ve decided t’ take ’em,
but it’s on one condition. Y’ll ’ave t’
allow a rejection o’ twenty.”

“Hanko”: The flurry of cables telling
of London Zoo’s new panda entertaining
visitors by standing on her head reminds
me of a koala I once observed ponder-
ously and determinedly attempting hand-
stands and somersaults. I was still laugh-
ing when I told an old Gippsland bush-
man about it. “Yes,” he said. “They
often do that when they’re sick. . Poor
devils get some complaint back in the
ears.” Later I was to discover that the
old-timer’s say-so was right. It doesn’t
follow, of course, that the Chinese bear
has a wad of pak-a-pu tickets in her
tympanum, but I still can’t forgive myself
for being amused by the clownish antics
of that poor Billy Bluegum.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Can’t accept “The
O.D.'s” view that the Australian’s regard
for horseflesh on the hoof explains his
repugnance to it on the menu, even
allowing, purely for the sake of argument
and against the weight of evidence, that
we are a nation of horse-lovers. (“The
O.D.’s” picture of the small boy who
hobnobs with the baker’s horse, and later
grows up to frequent s.-p. shops and
garnish his speech with horsey phrases
such as “feed it to the lions,” is touching,
but unconvincing.) The desert Arab,
whose consideration for his horse is his
one admirable trait, would as soon think
of selling his mares out of the country
or castrating his stallions as he would of
eating either; but let him get his thiev-
ing hands on a stranger’s horse of a dif-
ferent breed, and his aversion to eating
horse-flesh vanishes. Does “The 0.D.”
suggest that the child who loves his pet
lamb won’t eat mutton? And that the
flesh of elderly horses being inferior to
beef or mutton is merely a reason for
our not eating it, not for our disliking the
very thought? No. The reason lies far
deeper than anything “The 0.D.” has
suggested, and I’m reluctantly forced to
withdraw my objection to the cloven-hoof
argument. Maybe there’s something in
the old biblical injunction, after all.
* * * *
“The 0.D.”: Was glancing idly through
a story by E. Gollschewsky in B. 3/7/’46
when this hit my eye: “Far away in the
hills a curlew moaned, and a fox an-
swered with his* baby-in-distress yowl.”
Read on anxiously, but nowhere in the
story was an explanation given of the
reason for that curlew moaning. I’m
left to conclude that it swallowed what it
thought was a clover burr and discovered,
too late, that it was a Murray sandflea.

“Zake”: Harry and Tom fossicked in
partnership around the old Araluen
(N.S.W.) diggings. One midday they
came " back to camp for lunch,
and while Harry made the fire he
told Tom to get the billy that was
already filled with water and put it
on. About five minutes later Tom came
along with a handful of tea, prised the
lid off the billy that seemed to be sizzling
rather than boiling, and was about to
heave the tea in when he changed his
mind. Then, carefully replacing the lid,
he hooked the can off by the handle with
Come up here , Ben—you get a better view."
a thick stick. Standing uncertainly for a
second or two, he made for where Harry
was gazing across the ridge to the distant
road, and placed the billy gently in the
shade cast by his mate. He stood then,
holding Harry in conversation for a
minute, but when Harry went to move off
Tom said: “Just stop where y’ are fr a
minute.” The old fossicker looked curi-
ously at his partner. “What’s the game,
Tom —y’ gone batty or somethin’?”
Tom put his finger to his lips and waited.
About a minute later he gently lifted the
lid off the billy and pointed to the con-
tents. “Blastin’ powder,” he said. “I
wanted to get it cool quick an’ there ain’t
a tree f’r a hundred yards or so. Now
why the hell must y’ go an’ shove that
stuff in the billy?” _ “Well, I was goin’
to put it tempory in the empty flour-
tin,” replied Harry, “but I thought y*
might go makin’ a damper! ”
* * * *
“Betcha”: The paddock had been dug
out but not dogged, and my ancient
greyhound kept putting up stray rabbits
and coursing them into a small patch of
fern. So many had safely landed there
that I investigated, and discovered the
shoot the diggers had missed. A furred
rump showed from the opening, and as
the hide-out was shallow I grabbed a
sharp piece of wood and helped the mong
scratch it out. The bunnies were packed
tight, and we dragged out 44 before
striking the end. Boasting of the haul
from one burrow, I was met by a snort
from old Jack, who promptly invited me
to his digging-out grounds to “see what a
real burrer’s like.” The one he selected
was in loose, sandy soil, and nowhere ran
to a depth of much over 2ft., but it took
several hours to finish. The tally was
110.
* * * *
“M.U.R.”: I’ve never tasted a limpet
(B. 3/7/’46), but one fastened itself to
me on the Murray outside Euston years
ago. It was a small creature with an
outer shell or crust of wrinkled brown
chamois-like material and under that a
sort of secondary crust paling from tan
to white as it deepened. Above and below
its eyes was a whiskery growth of fine
spines, generally a dirty grey color, and
it had the typical sucking mouth. Its eyes
were a remarkable feature, being a deep
liquid brown and with an expression
almost as lugubrious as those of a cocker
spaniel. When it first attached itself I
tried gentle methods of removal, gradu-
ally becoming harsher until real violence
was achieved. ’Twas vain; the thing
stuck to me until, driven by desperation,
I consulted Alf Simmonds, a bit of a
bush vet. on Tammit. Alf soberly eyed
the affliction, then said, “That’s what we
call a Jimmybeggs. The only thing to do
is go to George Medley’s dispensary, buy
about a quid’s worth of his bulk elixir,
pour it into the Jimmybeggs and top it
off with a double dose of schnapps ; then,
when the creature is unconscious, detach
it, lay it carefully in a shady place and
yourself depart more than a day’s journey
by foot.” It worked, thobgh I’ve always
thought the cost excessive.
* * *
“C.E.”: Are the earth tremors of this
country sufficient to open large cracks in
the ground? A tremor in an East Gipps-
land district is accepted by the owner as
the most likely cause of large cracks that
appeared recently on his grazing slopes.
No rain, he claims, had fallen on the
hillside for some time prior to the open-
ings in the surface, which seemed to come
all at once, and encompass an area of
approximately four acres. > Heavy rains
have considerably widened the cracks,
which threaten to send the affected grass-
land sliding into the valley below. Land-
slides in this district are not uncommon ;
nor, for that matter, are earth tremors. Yet
it seems scarcely feasible that a quake
that makes itself known by a strange
unplaceable noise, and a rock so light it
no more than rattles the crockery, could
shake loose four acres of heavy pasture.
* * * *
“Myzomela”: Evidently “Wigwag”
(B. £9/6/’46) has never seen coconuts
within the true hurricane belt or he
wouldn’t state that “nuts rarely fall in a
high wind.” Planters in the New
Hebrides —breeding ground of hurricanes
which hit the Queensland coast —could
tell him a very different story. They
have in a single night lost all
the dry and green coconuts, as well
as most of the palm-leaves, and
had to wait three years and longer befoie
any more nuts were ready to harvest.
The “eye” of the coconut palm, which
lies at the base of the tall central spathe
of unopened leaves, carries the already
formed leaves and fruit which will de-
velop and ripen during the subsequent
five years. Consequently, if damaged by
wind or injured so that insect pests or
fungi spores can reach them, these palm
embryos do not develop and no flowers
or fruit form until several years later.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: We were playing our
last match with Undowangie before leav-
ing for a Gippsland contract and Mat got
among the Boutye supporters and backed
our side to the tune of £l5. Then he
threw himself into the game and ran me
and the rest of the team off our legs.
We had a two-goal lead at half-time,
but sundry Boutye men thought of that
£l5, bestirred themselves, slapped on a
few goals and got to the front. Rain fell
and made the ground greasy and we
started the last quarter 10 points down.
Mat played like a champion, and with me
roving to his rucking and his yelling
“There’s fifteen nicker in that” every
time he knocked it out we managed to
give Ginger Howell a chance and he took
it for the goal. More rain came, the light
faded and the game got a bit rough, with
the umpire watching Mat closely and
penalising him frequently. Five minutes
to go and still three points behind, Mat
came out of a ruck with the ball and
knocked the umpire down. He picked
himself up and, stirred by the general
excitement, hurriedly bounced the ball.
Mat grabbed it, galloped about a cl ain
and slammed it between the sticks for a
sixer. That night on the train, pocketing
my share of the £l5, I said, “But I still
can’t understand why that umpire didn’t
whistle you up when you ran so far with
the ball.” “I can,” Mat grinned. “When
I dumped him in the mud I took care to
fill his whistle up with it.”
* * * *
“Dronestung”: The thick brittle out-
side layer of bark on many gums won’t
last like box (B. 19/6/’46), but it’s great
fuel for camp-oven cooking. Idea is to
scoop a hole in the ground just larger
than the oven, fill it with bark and set
alight, heating the oven and lid while the
fire works up to a bed of coals. Scrape
out most of the glowing coals, then insert
the oven and draw the remains of the
fire over the lid. Damper is baked to a
turn when the coals dissolve in ashes.
* * * *
“Exkewex”: Whenever one of our herd
of dairy cows started to function on only
three cylinders, we generally let her rear
her calf and, with plenty of milk avail-
able, we would present the lady with an
additional calf of much the same
age. The “coupling method” used
by “Betcha” (B. 19/6/ ’46) for twin
lambs we also adopted, though we
used a hobble strap and a couple
of wide strips of greenhide for the
job. What we did find out was
that when it comes to adopting an
orphan cows vary as much in their
reactions as do humans. Some
took to the foundling at once, and
one quiet old stager, whose own
calf died at birth, accepted two
“newies” with complete equanimity.
In most cases if you coupled the
calves soon after birth and then kept
them away from the cow for ten hours
or so the cow accepted the twins, but
now and then a fussy individual had to be
bailed up night and morning for a few
days. One stubborn old Strawberry was,
despite our best efforts, apparently quite
prepared to starve her own offspring in
order to deny the foundling a drink.
Most of the steers so reared were eventu*
ally sold to bullockies, the general opinion
being that they were worth a quid apiece
extra because they were so easily broken
in on account of their having been coupled
for a fortnight or so in their early youth.
* * * *
“Fang”: “Propalong” came in with a
snigger at a shooting companion used to
hare-shooting who pointed at a supposed
rock \yhich hopped away a kangaroo.
Now (B. 19/6/’46) the ’roo has turned
out an old buck euro in just the right
color tones for perfect camouflage, on
hot days “always in the shade of a bush
or a rock and almost always flat out.”
Since “Prop” has thereby given away the
point of his original par. there remain
no further grounds for argument; in fact,
I’m glad to get out before Yogi “Propa-
long” exercises his power on that buck
euro and switches to a three-tailed fantod
sleeping it off in the shade of a willy-
willy.
* * M *
“Nor’-'west”: My entry for the Useful
Tree Stakes —the baob or baobab of the
Kimberleys. First virtue: a spreading
umbrella of foliage in a parched land dur-
ing the long northern “dry.” Second: a
practically permanent water supply for
moderate demands ; the huge trunk and
larger limbs are invariably gnarled into
deep pits and rocks, often holding gallons,
which fill during the “wet” and being
shaded carry over through the “dry.” As
fruit it grows nuts, hundreds of them,
large, lemon-shaped, often lOin. long by
4in. dia. through the bulbous part. Inside
these nuts are kernels about the size of a
haricot bean. These kernels yield a waxy
substance, palatable and tasting much like
the Brazil nut. From the trunk exudes
a gum which may be eaten straight, or
mixed with water, making a palatable
drink. The tree itself has three handy
attributes: it is immune from the white
ant; it resists the passing bushfire ; and il
is able to cover any cut or injured surface
with a fresh cover of bark. This faculty
extends even into the interior of a hollow
baob; the inside will be carrying bark.
So merely by chopping a doorway one
has a ready-made house. Emptied of its
edible contents the nut with its finely
granular surface has long served the abo-
riginal artist as a canvas, much of his
best, though fugitive, work being thus
preserved.
MY SPLENDID SONG.
It came to me when I was young,
Who now am old and hoary,
To write a splendid poem, strung
On lines of lyric glory.
1 sat me down that summer morn
Awaiting inspiration;
And rose at eve with mind forlorn
And wearied by frustration.
“Now art,” said I, “must be a thing
Of fitting mood and season;
Mayhap the coming in of spring
Will bring the Muse to reason.”
'
When winter went —a barren time,
Too cold for composition—
Reverting to my splendid rhyme,
I picked a choice position
On mosses by a river brink
O’erhung by seemed myrtle,
With bell-birds making rhythmic clink
And turtle doves to turtle.
“Alas, alack and well-a-day!”
(Forgive that fond quotation!)
At dusk I threw my pen away
In utter aggravation.
t
I had not got a line to scan,
A couplet to re-couple.
The Muse, elusive hoyden, ran
On nimble legs and supple
Along that river bank, to hide
At last among the thistles.
Nor would she forth. r all I tried
Of coaxing calls anu whistles.
“This ends our courtship, jade,” I cried,
Uncaring wh'at such rage meant—
“ You’ve broken faith and thrown aside
The bond of our engagement.”
A decade passed. Up seven floors
Above a noisy city
She came and sang outside my doors
A facile, foolish ditty.
I, weakly, called the hussy in.
That fatal invitation
Has led to all the woes within
A writer’s occupation.
But what —beyond a shrunken purse
And doubtful fame —doth grieve me,
Though matters go from bad to worse,
The Lady will not leave me 1
VICTORIA.
E. J. BRADY.


“Old-timer”: The cattle had bedded
down quietly for the night and most of
the drovers, poking borak at the envious
nightwatch, departed for the township a
couple of miles away. Bluey, Queensland
heeler and top dog of the outfit, watched
them go, cocked an inquiring eye at the
cud-chewing mob, thoughtfully inspected
the cook’s waggonette, growled menac-
ingly at nothing in particular, then
squatted on his haunches and pondered.
Then he ambled carefully around the
cattle, keeping wide, checked up on the
nightwatch and returned to the camp,
where he again inspected the waggonette.
A vagrant breeze came from the town-
ship and Bluey went to a clear space,
raised his nose and carefully analysed the
odors it bore. He whined a little, moved
restlessly, wiped his face on a tussock,
stood immobile for some seconds, then
drifted silently into the darkness. A
half-hour later trouble began in that town.
Four local dogs ruminating in front of the
post-office were fallen upon and mauled,
two chooks died in a mad five minutes
in the pub fowlhouse, an elderly gentle-
man was chased into a shop by a silent
shape with bared fangs and glaring eyes,
seven cats spent the rest of the night in
high places and a stray gelding galloped
wildly through the streets. Just on mid-
night Bluey trotted silently back into
camp and dropped under the waggonette,
having tasted the joys of town-life for a
brief while and now ready for the road
when the dawn came.

“Lub”: Charlie was always pottering
with inventions that didn’t work, but he
got a kick out of it and acquired know-
ledge. His operations covered many fields,
and when he came up against something
he didn’t know, which was often, he wrote
to a newspaper for free advice. Charlie
was up to his eyes in an experiment with
electricity and needed further enlighten-
ment. The newspaper answered in due
course. “There y’ are,” babbled Charlie
excitedly, pointing to his latest pen-name
in print. “I’m gettin’ on t’ somethin’ big
this time. Thought I was last time when
they couldn’t work out the answers, but
this time they can’t even unnerstan’ the
questions! ”

walk to town and, anyway, there is
something strangely appealing about sit-

ting behind a broad-hipped plodding
Clydesdale, Very soon it became evident
that the owner of the dray was not in
favor of the “modern way.” “Young
blokes don’t seem to have the inishative,”
he declared. “Their ’orse wants shoein’;
well, they’li drive a dozen miles to a
blacksmith ; their mate wants a ’aircut —
in to town again.” He was warming to his
theme when we plodded round a 'bend
and came across a young man gazing
dejectedly at the buckled wheel of a
sulky. Youth hailed Age: “Hey, Tom,
had a bit of trouble; as you go past
Bowden’s will you ask Charlie to bring
his truck out? Got to get this wreck
home somehow.” Tom grunted, studied
the situation for a moment, then taking
his axe from the dray walked into the
wayside scrub. He returned with a sap-
ling and a piece of wire from the broken-
down fence. Placing the sapling under
the axle, with the butt trailing well be-
hind, he lifted the thin end lever fashion
and lashed it to the shaft with the fencing
wire. Another lashing on the axle, and
the collapsed wheel was clear of the
ground with the butt of the sapling serv-
ing as a skid. “Lead the pony and you’ll
be home before I get anywhere near
Bowden’s,” he said. As we resumed our
journey the old ’un jerked his thumb.
“See what I mean? No inishative!”

“Horseless Horseman”: Mention of
those ants in S.Q. that communicate the
whereabouts of tucker supplies (0.
26/6/’46) recalls a breed in the Cape
York Peninsula that Morse-signal the
fact by knocking the ground with their
heads. No, you’re wrong—there was no
pub for miles. This bloke is a little bigger
than a sugar ant. At night a scout would
appear on the table, spot an appetising
insect killed by the flame of the carbide-
lamp, and bang the table several times
to summon the required fatigue party.
The tapping was exactly like that made
with the point of a pencil, and, at times,
I’ve tricked them into answering my
pencil-point. I’ll never forget those
blasted ants and their tapping. It was
then, with extra large, fatigue parties
endeavoring to haul moths about the
table, that I first tried to break into the
Council.

“Exkewex”: A personal item about the
death of F. W. L. Kleinschmidt (B.
19/6/ ’46) refers to his command, the
Maid of Sker, as a stern-wheeler. She
was a very elderly. Maid when I used to
see her every week at Southport a quarter
of a century ago, but she was a side-
wheeler then and I feel sure she always
had been. The Broadwater near South-
port was extremely shallow and the pas-
sage very winding, and the Maid had a
terrific amount of slack in her anchor
chains, so the steersman spun his wheel
continuously and vigorously, which gave
rise to the yarn amongst us kids that she
got along by gagging her rudder and
only used her paddles for steering. She
was a flat-bottomed craft and, according
to her crew, could get along quite nicely
if the sandy bottom was sufficiently
damp, but when’l knew her it was a red-
letter day if she made the round trip to
Brisbane without going ashore at least
once on the sandbanks of the shallow
and changeable Moreton )Bay.

“Notaden”: When will the average
Australian country-dweller learn the dif-
ference between ravens and crows, and
refrain from murdering valuable bene-
factors who take a vital part in keeping
down the blowfly pest? Their unfortu-
nate similarity in plumage, shape and size
has gained for the crow (Corvus ceciUe)
the same evil reputation for lamb-murder
and mutilation that is so foully deserved
by the raven (C. coronoides). Their voices
are enough to make the difference clear,
the “loud deep Gwar-Gwar, varied witn
shrill, high-sounding Korr-Korr, as
North has so well described the raven s
cry, being unmistakeable for the softer
and more highly-pitched Car-Car-Car of
the crow. Of some physical differences,
ravens have white eyes, and the down of
their feathers is dusky grey; the eyes of
crows are hazel and the feather-down is
white. The small-billed crow (C. bennetti)
has white eyes, but its smaller size and
the different bill make it recognisable.
Crows are insectivorous, and although
they may appear to feed on carcasses at
times” they are really after blowfly larvae
and have taken no part in the killing,
They also eat grasshoppers, caterpillars
and other insects destructive to grass or
“Next time you come around, Joe, give me me matches back!"
crops. To do the raven justice it helps
with the blowfly pest by eating carcasses
which would otherwise nourish fly larva:,
but this is a small thing in comparison with
its crimes against young and sick animals.

“Frank Mauri”: Scotty, a giant of a
man, was a miner on the Ramu. His
dentures had cost him a tidy sum, what
with plane trips in and out of Wau and
a week of high spots every time he went
there. One morning he was carefully
brushing them in the basin when his
partner announced that the District Officer
was about to pay them an official visit.
The D.O. was Scotty’s pet aversion. “If
he comes here I’ll throttle the cow!” he
growled, and clenched a mighty paw.
Ten minutes later Scotty was shaving in
preparation for the first of another series
of visits to Wau.
* * * *
“Naturala”: The catfish, freshwater or
estuarine, is a noted mover of stones.
Those cleared spaces noted by “Zake
(B. 12/6/’46) are food-catching areas.
Being a bottom dweller, the catfish seeks
its food there, worms and small crus-
taceans, and being also a night hunter
well, the value of a large cleared space
over which to nose around for anything
that drifts along is obvious. Which is
also why the owner of such a circle re-
sents intrusion. Stones, of course, would
be obstacles under which potential prey
might hide. During the spawning season
the female catfish reverses the process and
constructs a small circle just big enough
for her to coil round in. Here, while
the male hovers in the vicinity, she
deposits her eggs, which are thus shielded
from being carried away by the current,
while the stones also serve as a guid-
ance to the male in the shedding of his
milt.
* * * *
“Propalong”: For a week after Dad
brought home Splendid, the long-pedi-
greed Jersey bull, homestead life was de-
moralised. Splendid bossed the cows,
evicted the horses, menaced the fowls,
exiled the dogs and put the fear~Of his
bovine lordship into the women. And
then one day young Bill went out for the
ration sheep. Among the wethers was
Bally, formerly the kids’ pet, now a husky
two-tooth ram. As soon as the mob were
yarded Bally slipped through the fence
and set off to renew old acquaintances
round the stables and yards, pausing to
stare at the stranger in the places that
were his. He watched with cynical in-
terest while the intruder swayed pon-
derously towards him and stopped to
throw dirt with his forefeet. Splendid,
for his part, must have been dimly sur-
prised when his martial preparations left
the ridiculous woolly animal unmoved.
He prolonged the rumbling and dirt-
throwing much longer than his imperious
nature usually allowed and then shuffled
closer, stopping 10 yards from Bally with
his great head low to the ground. That
was something that Bally understood.
Without wasting time on preliminaries he
charged, hit the massive forehead with
a thud that shook down the tools in the
blacksmith’s shop, trotted back and
charged again. He was quite prepared to
charge the third time, but by then Splen-
did was bellowing up the paddock, look-
ing for a safe place behind the cows,

“Bo”: ‘ Some blokes, said Nevertire
Ned,” “are unreasonable. Take that new
neighbor o’ mine. Me fire aint dronn
too good, so I has a screw up the

surprised. “Strike me, y’ don’t think I

“B. 4”: For sheer originality com-
mend me to this Australian invention,
which rivals that outlined by “Golden
Mile” (B. 3/7/’46). Dining with a selec-
tor on the Nogoa River, C.Q., one stifling
night we presently experienced re-
lief as a three-ply punkah attached to a
thin steel rod athwart the ceiling wafted
refreshing zephyrs across the dining table.
I heard no engine rhythm nor discerned
any ensconced punkah wallah; and
my puzzled glances evoked laughter and
enlightenment. My host invited me to
look below, and there beneath his boots
was the treadle of a discarded Singer
sewing-machine. This was ingeniously
geared to the punkah, which silently swung
backwards and forwards as Aiolus
treadled his wind-maker.

“Bo”: “Those Kearneys out by The
Bluff are a queer lot,” the travelling en-
cyclopoedia salesman was saying. I
dropped in there today. It’s easier to sell
to men than women, of course, so I
looked for Kearney, but he wasn’t
around. I’m starting to put the h.-p. sales
talk on his missus, and making heavy
weather of it, when one of the men came
up and says to her ‘Barney’s got away
again—been goro for some time, too, I
think.’ Mrs. Kearney excuses herself
and gets on the ’phone. She tells who-
ever she rings to get the boys to keep a
good look out for Barney, an’ if he’s
brought home she’ll give ’em the usual
reward. A bit later on, just as I’m about
to go after I’d signed her up for a set,
the ’phone rings. When she answers it
I hear her say ‘Good on you, Andy.
Didn’t do any damage? That’s good.
Bring him up to the house. If I happen
to be down the paddock, lock Barney in
the front bedroom. Good-bye.’ I thought
it seemed funny, putting a bull in a bed-
room.” Bung looked at the traveller
and grinned. “Barney ain’t a bull—he’s
Mrs. Kearney’s husband,” he said. “Y’
see, every so often he kicksxover the
traces an’ goes on a bender. Mrs.
Kearney don’t mind, but when Barney
gets full he always wants to be an ex-
plorer and he makes for the dense scrub
back o’ the township. Once we had a
search party out for two days before we
got him. So now Mrs. K. has a standin
reward of half a note for the bloke who
hog-ties an’ drives him back to her.”
WINTER NIGHT.
There is no promise in the stars tonight;
No lovers linger, for the moon’s delight
Is frozen by the winds that swoop and mass
And pause, and then in wilder motion pass.
The willows shiver, wishing for their leaves
Of summer, and the tall pine coldly heaves
Itself in one long shudder against the sky;
There is no voice, no sound, no song, no cry.
Only the lantern at the comer glows,
Swinging in the turbulence that blows
With lively passion, playing merry beams
On road and rail with its elusive gleams.
Only the late traveller’s ringing feet
Resound a moment in the empty street
And fade, and children sheltered in their beds
Hear the wind and cover up their heads.
QUEENSLAND.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Need for Classing Reform.
“Keratin,” who was a woolclasser be-
fore the war, returned from active service,
did a refresher couse at a Tech. College
and qualified with honors, and has put in
the past two seasons at classing, rises in
wrath from the heart of Queensland: —-
“Woolclassers” who s “rung themselves in”
during the war are a menace. In my district
there is not one qualified classer employed by
contractors. These pseudo woolmen are carry-
ing on the deplorable classing standards of the
war years, learning only from their obvious
blundering when prices are released. That is
Evil No. 1.
Evil No. 2 is the emphasis on pace under the
present contract system. This is accentuated by
the 40-hour week, which means less time to
shear the same number of sheep and earn the
mess account money which formerly was earned
on the Saturday morning. Pace means uneven
shearing, irregular fleeces and' no pride in the
finish of a sheep. Many contractors, tnerefore,
assume the responsibility of a classer. No
proof of qualification or character is asked for,
and the contractor, interested only in the
number of sheep shorn in the shortest possible
time, is not interested in the clip get-up. He
is interested in working a shednand or two
short’, often cutting his contract price to get a
shed with this in mind, and the “classer” is
not likely to protest, knowing his job would
cease forthwith. He might also b'e overseer,
enginedriver, expert and book-keeper, so
that some branch of the shed work would
suffer. Naturally, the clip suffers.
Evil No. 3 is the owner. Much could be
written on his shortcomings, and I’m not losing
sight of industrial and other problems. The
amazing thing is the grazier’s attitude to the
need for his one technical man to be bona
fide. With his motor-car or his tailor he is
cautious and wary of being fooled. But with a
woolclip, often his sole income, he allows any-
body at all to pull it about and pays well for
that doubtful privilege. Whether he does this
consciously or not has no effect on the mone-
tary result. Many owners fail to notice that
the classer is often a lone wolf, without co-
operation from shearer, shedhand or owner.
Even the presser will give the classer-orders
under the present system.
The most important day in the shed, the first,
when the average of the wool is sought and
the lines are set, is too often now taken up in
cleaning out filthy walls and floors in ill-lighted
sheds, repairing obsolete tables, covering the
chutes for t'he shearer (who must have priority
of attention) and conveying demands from the
men to the boss. When the classer finds he
has to fight to get a share of a room and that
someone else has the only table, if he is a
qualified man ,he wonders if the owner has for-
gotten all about the existence of the wool-
classers’ award. Moreover, when we find bore-
drams close to shearing sheds and no provision
tor watering yards inches deep in dust we ask
ourselves is the woolgrower an intelligent man
or wilfully blind.
Evil No. 4 is the fellow who is allowed to
practise at woolclassing today, and with him
are those who sanction such a thing in the
most vital industry we have.
could be achieved on these lines:
(1) Awards must be pdliced and the classer
produce his authority to practise (not to be
confused with a sheaf of brokers’ “references”).
Examination at an approved college or insti-
tution, plus the necessary apprenticeship in
shearing sheds, scours, etc., and satisfactory
evidence from both graziers and brokers to be
submitted to Federal or State authorities and
Jaw Ct t 0 reVlSlon at any time ’ to be
(2) A pool of classers could be formed from
registered qualified men, from which growers,
brokers and woolstores could draw by arrange-
ment, all of them to provide the classer with
decent accommodation.
(3) Refresher courses (far removed from cor-
respondence courses, with questions and answers
ana samples and a diploma) and Government-
sponsored opportunities for those interested in
wool to visit stores and other places where
right and wrong can be demonstrated. Insofar
as Queensland is concerned, with its clip made
up of 95 p.c. merino and it's small range of
qualities, the remedy applied at once would be
felt the first season. Methods for determining
standardisation of brands, elimination of general
faults and other anomalies would revive the
status of the genuine man and rebound in the
form of increased monetary returns to the
grower.
The greatest weapon the manufacturers of
synthetic fibres can exploit to their advantage
is the lackadaisical attitude accepted as good
enough in wool production areas of Australia.
Wounds in Horses.
“C.A.A.”: The fundamental principle
is to provide downward drainage for dis-
charges. If such drainage is provided
most wounds heal satisfactorily, but deep
“ ’Fraid the wife cant see you just now. Wot about poppin' back in
half an hour?”
wounds downwards form pockets and pus
and discharges collect within them and
cannot get away.
Wounds upward need little interference
beyond ensuring that they remain open
while healing and that they are reason-
ably clean on the surface. In cases of
downward penetration it is necessary judi-
ciously to use a knife to provide that the
discharge moves freely downwards. Be-
fore beginning any treatment clip the in-
jured edges to remove the hair and reveal
the true nature of the wound. Next
wash thoroughly with warm, weak disin-
fectant. If necessary the depth of the
wound may be explored with a blunt in-
strument which has been boiled.
Common example of an improperly
drained wound is a puncture of the sole.
Microbes enter and pus and a black, foul-
smeiling matter collect and continue to ac-
cumulate because they cannot drain away.
Acute lameness follows. If unattended
these corrupt 1 fluids rise slowly above the
level of the hoof and eventually break cut
through the soft skin over the coronet;
by then the structure within the foot is
in a bad state and the case has become
very serious.
To deal with punctures the whole of
the foot is cleaned and, if possible, held
in a bucket of warm disinfectant solution
to clean it further and soften the horn.
The sole is then pared away by making
a cone-shaped hole over the point of in-
jury. The apex of the cone must be
carried right through the horn, when the
corrupt fluids will escape and the lame-
ness disappear. To prevent the hole fill-
ing up a pad soaked in Stockholm tar
may be placed in position and held there
by a tin-plate interposed between foot
and shoe. Apply a dressing once or twice
weekly, and see the horn is not growing
over before all the discharges have got
away.
Border-streams Agreement.
“Agric”: At long last agreement has
been reached between the N.S.W. and
Queensland Governments for the use of
the waters from the Dumaresq-Mclntyre
border streams for water conservation
and irrigation projects. Immediately the
necessary ratifying* legislation is passed,
Queensland will start irrigation works for
70,000 acres on the Queensland side.
To provide security against drought for
graziers and fat-stock producers, lucerne
and other crops will be grown under irri-
gation, and a fillip should be given to the
growing of tobacco. A few years ago, by
the use of pumping plants in these border
rivers, tobacco-growing prospered, but
grading niceties introduced by the manu-
facturers made production on many farms
in Southern Queensland uneconomic.
Mareeba, Dimbulah and other districts
of North Queensland certainly appear to
have the conditions considered to be ideal
for tobacco-growing—heavy rainfall and
humid conditions but experienced
growers in Southern Queensland claim
that it would be a success elsewhere if
manufacturers paid a better average price
per pound instead of an exceptionally
high price for first-quality leaf and low
prices for the other grades. Manu-
facturers, however, contend that to pay a
flat rate would be the equivalent of offer-
ing a premium for inefficiency, and while
that viewpoint prevails farmers on other
than first-class tobacco-growing land are
not likely to make a success of the crop.
Cotton authorities are hopeful that
farmers on irrigated land along the border
will go in for cotton. Cotton-growing
is not likely to be economically successful
until an efficient mechanical picker is
available, either at a price within the
reach of the smaller farmer or lent out
by a co-operative concern, such as a
butter factory. It has been estimated that
even one-third of the land which will be
irrigated from the border streams would
produce 15,000 bales of raw cotton annu-
ally. In 1945 only 8000 acres were under
cotton, compared with 60,000 acres a few
years ago.

Carrot Growing.
“Rooster”: July is the month to start
planting ’em. Use as much fowl and
stable manure as there is and turn it in
on the second ploughing. Topdress with
blood manure —about 16 cwt. to the acre.
Rows should be well “hilled.” Drainage
is important, as carrots dislike wet or
sloppy ground. A fall of two inches to
each furrow will ensure a good run-off.
Shallow drilling is advisable. Make the
drills an inch deep, 10in. apart, and four
rows to the span. Drop seeds as lightly
as possible (about 10 seeds every three
inches) and cover lightly with soil. Ger-
mination takes place rapidly if seeds are
sown shallow. When the plants have
grown 2in. high pull out all but one in
each place, leaving the seedlings 3in.
apart.
Here in Gippsland, with an average
annual rainfall of 36in., any root crop
does well without artificial watering.
Carrots are no exception. They thrive
on warm sunshine. Cultivation should be-
gin as soon as plants are up and should
continue once a week until the tops have
attained maximum growth.
Carrots are subject to attack from
aphis, blight and rust. As soon as either
appears begin dusting with Bordeaux
mixture once a week, alternately nicotine
powder, and continue until pest is eradi-
cated. Should the pest suddenly appear
as the tops are maturing replace these
insecticides with derris powder, which is
less harsh on the plant itself.
The crop be ready for digging
in late November. Provided it has been
treated as outlined above, any soil will
yield from six to eight tons per acre, and
even in a season will give from three
to four tons. We cleared £4B off four
acres in one season from carrots, and a
ton in reserve on the farm never goes
astray.
Early Tomatoes Pay.
“H. Early”: Anywhere along the
eastern coast, where fruitfly is an active
pest during late summer, it pays to plant
tomatoes to ripen by Christmas. Seed
should be sown without delay. Under
glass or hessian will do for germination.

A hotbed ensures quick showing up of
seedlings and earlier transplanting.
To make a hotbed, dig a hole -It.
deep and fill it with fresh stable manure.
Put in “flats” or seedboxes of a sandy
medium soil, right on top of the manure
Sow seed on the surface and just bury it
under a topping of sand and sifted old
manure. Don’t sow to excess. If seed
germinates too thickly thin out seedlings.
As soon as they are big enough to handle,
transplant them into good soil under a
cool frame, with a roller hessian cover.
In the hotbed stage, be careful not to
overwater, and on any but dry, windy
days allow air to enter by lifting the
frame sashes. Close them at night always.
Too much moisture and humidity can
cause losses. . , „
After transfer to the hessianed frame,
where the plants should be sin. to 6in.
apart, overwatering is again the danger.
Just enough to maintain growth is needed.
Plant the seedlings no deeper than they
were in the boxes. Box work facilitates
transplanting and the hardening process
under hessian prepares the plants for
transfer to open ground. That should be
done as soon as frost danger is past.
In warm, frost-free districts the hotbed
is not necessary. A cold frame of glass
or hessian wil| do for all the work.
Plant the tomatoes in good, rich sou
with a balanced feeding ration dug in by
August or September. Use early-matur-
ing varieties like Earliana strains, Chalk s
Early Jewel, Break o’ Day and Australian
Large Red.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sheepo”: No grazier should be with-
out a hospital paddock for sheep suffering
from ailments that are not contagious. It
should be handy to the homestead and be
of an area that will permit of easy muster-
ing. Good watering facilities are essen-
tial and near to the water there should
be a small yard. For badly flyblown
sheep a hospital paddock is invaluable
and it enables treatment to be carried
out regularly with results that must be
obvious.
“Dusty Gully”: A farmer-cwm-trapper
got the idea of buying young pigs and
feeding them with boiled rabbits and a
small ration of maize. They had free
range of a fair-sized paddock.. Pigs did
well for a time, putting on weight
quickly; then prospects of a decent
profit dwindled after a few mysterious
deaths. An autopsy showed intestines
pierced by bones. Probably this was due
to large accumulations of bones in the
diet. He now strains the bones and
does quite well from his venture.
“Myrrhee”: Allow a hide to cool be-
fore salting, but don’t delay the operation
longer than 10 or 12 hours after death
if quality in the leather is the aim. Re-
move substances, blood, dirt, etc., likely
to check penetration of the salt and en-
courage bacterial growth. Use fresh,
clean salt only, and sprinkle on an amount
equal to one-third butcher’s weight of the
hide. Calfskins need up to one half
their weight of salt. If skins are to be
kept on hand for any length of time,
spray or paint for weevils or other ver-
min with a mixture, lib. arsenite of soda;
to five gallons water.
“B.”: When it’s not grown with Wim-
mera rye, cultivate the lucerne patch in
July or August. Grazed areas where
tramping sets surface soil like cement
need it most. Loosening aerates the soil,
ensures moisture reaching greater depth
and prevents it flowing ofi over the sur-
face. Evaporation losses decrease. Use
a rigid-tine or spring-tooth cultivator, the
latter fitted with narrow tines. When sown
with rye grass, cultivate in the late
summer or early autumn before the grass
seed germinates. This bit of attention
supplies a good bed for the seed when it
falls and it races along to early growth ,
soil is right for autumn or winter rains.
“Farmer Bill”: While cattle can eat up
to 1001 b. of roots—or pumpkin—a day,
the equivalent of 101 b. of grain,
401 b. is a satisfactory ration. Allow sheep
201 b.; 21b. pumpkin about equals 3oz. of
grain in drought. Pigs and horses may
eat up to 401 b. without harm, but from
10-201 b. keeps condition good. High
nutrient, content of carrots makes then',
nourishing feed fdr dairy cattle, pigs,
poultry. Feeding turnips before milking
taints the product.
“Plane Creek”: Magnesium deficiency
can prevent green peas from doing well
(B. 12/6/’46). Watering peas with mag-
nesium sulphate (Epsom salts) water has
been responsible for vastly improved
crops of peas on parts of the C.Q. coast.
Gardeners should experiment with mag-
nesium before making great use of it,
some creek-waters are rich in it. The
ordinary Epsom salts obtainable from
any pastoral supply company in bulk
quantities is good enough, loz. or 2oz. to
the gallon of water.
“H.C.”: To conserve moisture, plant
windbreaks. Evaporation in immediate
lee of trees is reduced by up to 60 p.c.
Protection given the area equals in width
from six to 15 times the height of the
trees according to their maturity and
local conditions. Result in soil moisture
is equivalent to substantial increase m
rainfall.


IN ENGLAND
TO-DAY
If you could see the queues that daily
line up to buy shoes in this country
we know you wouldn’t complain because
we can send so few overseas. We have been making
ladies’ and children’s shoes for over 120 years,
we turn out over a million pairs a year and yet
there is still a scarcity. But conditions will
improve and we hope our shipments abroad
will grow considerably larger.

Australia, in common with other countries,
is faced with the vital necessity of finding
outlets for its peace time production.
Failure to develop export trade will re-act
harshly on the Australian worker resulting
in unemployment and reduced living
standards.
Rich potential markets in China, Malaya,
India and the Netherlands Indies are being
energetically developed by other nations,
whilst in Australia, ships that could have
carried Australian merchandise to those
markets, lie idle in our ports.
Is it not futile , therefore , for political
leaders to talk of full employment
whilst they permit the few wreckers m
this country to deliberately strangle its
export trade?.

with a hearty lunge bowls him over back-
wards. Before he can rise a huge paw
clamps down on his collar-band and jerks
him half upright. He’s shaken like an
old doormat and planted on his feet.
“Now get!” says a man’s voice. And
there’s big Lopella’s black enraged face
and bulging fists. Uncle Ted is strong
and usually he would never put up with
such treatment, but in his present state
he’s in no condition to object.
Stella lolls on the trunk holding her
sides. “Oh, ha, ha, ha,” she laughs.
“Oh, ho, ho, ho! The old fool, the silly
old fool. Fancy him! Oh, he, he, he! ”
Her face is red and distorted and
grotesque.
Grabbed by the collar and the seat of
his pants Uncle Ted is run from the tent.
He has a glimpse of the jeering and
malicious faces of the nice young men
gathered outside the tent as he’s hustled
past. In a moment he’s flung to his
knees beside a tub of chaffy water, and
with a splash he’s upended and his head
plunged to the bottom.
“There! there! there!” shouts Lopella,
and with each shout Uncle Ted is raised
and plunged under again. “Has that
cooled y’ off? Eh? eh? eh?” Then
Uncle Ted is dropped flat, and slowly it
dawns on him that the fellow has left
him. The grinning boys are gathered
round. Two of them help Uncle Ted to
his feet. One slaps the water from his
shoulders and rumples his thin, wet hair
with a handkerchief. Another finds his
hat, trampled on and hurled from the
tent, straightens it roughly and jams it
on Uncle Ted’s head.
“Come on now, old sport,” they say.
“We’ll see you on your way.”
Uncle Ted at first says “Let me at
him! Let me! ” But as he’s almost help-
less, especially his legs, the boys don’t
have much trouble holding him back.
They link arms with him and set off
around the circus. They caper and skip
and sing “Show me the way to go home”
and “Poor old man,” with Uncle Ted
hauled along, half-dragging his shambling
legs. Suddenly his weak eyes fill with
tears. The garish circus blurs and fades.
At last they take him to the paddock
where his gig is. They catch the pony
and harness up. They lift Uncle Ted
into the seat, where he slumps like a half-
empty sack. They try to prop him with
a bag of chaff. They hook the reins
around his arm. “All right, grandpa?”
they ask. “Pony’ll take you home all
right. Gee up, pony, get along home,
horsie.” And off the pony trots.
All at once Uncle Ted is overwhelmed
by the young men’s kindness. Such good
chaps. He must thank them properly.
“That’s good of you, boys, that’s good”
he can’t remember what he wants to
say. He must warn them of something.
Poor boys. He’s sorry for them. “You
don’t know yet, boys,” he begins, but
already the pony has carried him out of
the young men’s hearing.
THE pony took him home all right,
because when Uncle Ted began to
come to he was in his own cowyard. It
was the cows bellowing to be milked that
roused him. He had forgotten to get
Crummer’s boy to milk them. So just
as he is, in his wet and rumpled best
clothes, Uncle Ted sets about milking by
the light of the old kerosene lamp. He
finishes at dawn.
At last he goes indoors with Taipo
sniffing curiously at his heels and cower-
ing at a word, and strips off his muddy
and ruined best clothes. He fumbles in
the pockets unthinkingly. The pockets
are empty. His favorite pipe, his watch,
his wallet of banknotes —all gone!
In the raw grey light of the Sunday
dawn, shivering in his shirt-tails in the
middle of the kitchen floor, Uncle Ted
catches sight of a face in the blotchy
mirror on the wall. The stark, staring
eyes frighten him. He staggers forward,
he peers closer at the horrid face. His
face. Sunday morning, but his face isn’t
smooth and rosy-fresh as on other, re-
spectable, Sunday mornings. It’s already
covered with a rough stubble. On the
chin and round the mouth the red whis-
kers are almost lost among the grey. The
whole haggard face is lined and old.
Uncle Ted stares a long time, fingering
his grizzled chin, hungry, weary and
trembling. “If that’s the way of it,” he
says at last, “by God! I’ll never shave
again:”
Faint in the distance but clear on the
early morning air come the chutter-
chug-chug of an old Ford van, hoarse
inarticulate cries, a ribald laugh. The
circus has packed up and is on the move.

The leather of your hat should
always be turned out after a hot
day. Perspiration will then dry
out instead of being transferred
to your hat.
This hint is also useful to all who
use hair-oil, as it prevents grease
stains from appearing on the fur
felt.
Take the hint good hats are scarce.
1. The correct way to pul on a hat—grasp
brim at back and front.
2. Always brush WITH the nap—see arrow.
3. When rain-soaked, push out dents, turn
up brim and stand hat on level surface.
' 4. Always rest SIDE of hat on hat peg—
this allows hat to hang clear.
5. Never allow your hat to be placed In a
pile with other hats.
7. When laying aside a hat, put it away In

“Dear, dear.” The warden looked dis-

“No, it’s working fine. Except that

bed last night.”
“That man’s a moaner.” The warden
shook his head sadly. “Give him a lighter

quiet.”
“There’s a bit of trouble with the
laundry,” the warder went on. “The men
are complaining that their bedspreads
aren’t properly washed and ironed.”
“Well, we’ll just have to sack the
laundryman.”
“Can’t, I’m afraid. He’s in for 20

“This is dreadful. Do you think a

“Not much. They say it’s not nearly

are threatening to leave if things don t

The warden moaned and wrung his

“That’s not the worst of it, either,” the

My Business Success.
“It doesn’t necessarily follow that because
a firm is handling a large number of com-
plaints that it is going downhill. Quite often
the reverse is the case.” — Radio lecturer.
It wasn’t that things were in the dol-
drums with my laundry business. Actu-
ally, so prosperous had it become that I
was making out of it almost a third as
much as the taxation people were. But I
was worried over the lack of complaints
from customers. I mentioned it one day
to the foreman.
“That’s right, Mr. Giggelfitz,” he
, replied, with a queer sort of pride, “it’s
a testimony to the thorough workman-
ship and”
“A business without a complaint,” I
interrupted sternly, “is like an R.S.P.C.A.
meeting without a dogfight, a Sydney
Police Commissioner without a long list
of unsolved murders, a ‘Labor’ Minister
without three or four farms. It’s got to be
remedied. You had better start right now
with the shirt fronts. At present, I notice,
most of the operatives are 7st. ’teen-agers
with muscles like blancmange. They’ll
never ruin a good shirt. Replace them
with 14st. ex-barmaids whose right-arm
biceps are, through long exercise on the
beer pump, as big and hard as a High-
lander’s knees. When they start bringing
the iron down wallop on buttons, or let
it stand red-hot for a few minutes on the
neckband while they recount some of the
juicy stories the commercials ( used to tell
’em, things will start moving around these
parts. See to it!”
After that the first complaints began to
come in, although after a week I noted
with vexation that they were not sufficient
to warrant a full-time appointment to
deal with them. A slight improvement
occurred when I introduced an infallible
method of breaking buttons by turning
the shirts out instead of in when folding
them before they were put through the
wringer, the rubber rollers of which I
had replaced with sandstone ones.
It wasn’t, however, till we started
putting in caustic soda instead of kerosene
as a dirt-remover that we began to get
real results. As a laundryman, what
could I have registered other than a thrill
of deep pride when customers began to
storm in and complain that as they pulled
their shirts on an arm would fritter away
to shreds or the front fall off? Later, a
method I developed of treating the cuffs
with a special steel brush frayer put the
complaints department at last on a firm
footing, with two girls going flat out all
day handling ropable customers.
Then one day, while discussing over a
glass of beer with the manager of an-
other laundry the latest methods of muck-
ing up starched bat’s-wing collars and
ripping the tucks out of dress shirtfronts,
my complacency received a rude shock,
for, in passing, he boasted that his con-
cern had just had to appoint a sub-
manager and an assistant sub-manager to
direct their complaints department. Mor-
tified at this evidence of just how far my
own laundry was behind others, I got to
work in earnest.
Investigations disclosed that the idiot
in charge of delivery was actually return-
ing collars and shirts meticulously to the
people who had sent them in. This was
a direct negation of all sound laundry
principles. I corrected this by employing a
youth whose special job was to juggle up
the finished (1 use the term in its true
sense) articles, sling a handful as he came
to them into a parcel, tie it up so that it
was an amorphous bundle, leap on it a
few times and then consign it to the next
person on his list. This meant the strong
probability that scraggy-necked men
would get battered, near-white things as
big as horse collars to put on, while
beefy, 18in.-necked bookies, 1 union
leaders, etc., would be trying to struggle
into 14|in. “stranglers.”
After that the complaints department
bade fair to become the biggest branch of
the business, but 1 wasn’t yet satisfied.
The collars, I observed, were still going
out with more or less smooth edges. I
concentrated on what was obviously a
serious deficiency, finally evolving a pro-
cess which gave them a hacksaw edge
beautiful to behold.
But the acme of my triumph came
after I had employed a highly-paid com-
plaints consultant to advise the new well-
staffed department. One of my clients
sneezed while putting on a collar he had
just got back from us and severed his
jugular. My fellow-laundrymen are ten-
dering me a dinner this week to com-
memorate the happy event.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4j£d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
A Supreme Services Commander
Air Vice-Marshal Bostock’s grave
charges of Air Ministry and Air Board
interference and frustration in R.A.A.F.
operational control in the S.-W. Pacific,
following closely on similar complaints
by General Blarney in the Army Com-
mand, should lead to a searching inquiry
by independent experts, preferably from
Britain. Such an inquiry is needed, first
for the information of the public,
which pays and suffers and which was
starved of information during the war,
and second, as Bostock suggests, to pre-
vent repetition in any future war. Apart
from these considerations, recent techno-
logical developments of weapons and the
need for crystallising for future guidance
the lessons of the wars justify an analyti-
cal examination of the whole defence
set-up.
The time is opportune to determine
whether a completely unified control of
all three services should not be established.
President Truman recently asked Con-
gress to consider amalgamating the Army
and Navy (which in America include the
Air Force). Ever before the atom-bomb
test the Navy opposed amalgamation. In
the British Empire there would be strong
opposition for traditional reasons. But
the control of the three sen/ices by a
Supreme Commander, with a C.-in-C.
for each service, has much to recom-
mend it.
Common doctrine, language and stra-
tegic policy are more than ever essential,
now that all services fight on a common
battlefield in air, on water and on land.
Admiral Halsey suggested one uniform
to develop the unity spirit. In pre-war
estimates the Labor party in and out of
power opposed every attempt to im-
prove the stocks of s.a.a., gun ammu-
nition, equipment and clothing, as well
as experimental research on new
weapons. The services competed with
one another, each buying and cornering
the very limited stocks available in the
commercial world.
The Navy chief, Admiralty-appointed,
was in a better position to argue, under
threat of resignation and direct report to
the Admiralty, than the Army and Air
chiefs, who tried to expand a nucleus
skeleton force with a few crumbs from
the rich man’s table. Permanent per-
sonnel were paid only two-thirds of their
salary for a long period under the Scullin
regime. An overall commander for
all services, knowing the consolidated re-
quirements, could talk decisively to the
Cabinet.
Admittedly service representatives on
combined committees in 1939 and in the
first years of war did achieve some mea-
sure of co-ordination with Munitions,
Supply and other departments, but there
was no truly unified control of all ser-
vices working towards a single objective,
with maximum concentration of force and
economy of effort.
Transport, supply, engineering, medical
services, amenities were all duplicated and
triplicated. Each service had its own
specifications and sealed patterns for
thousands of items identical in purpose,
to the dismay of munitions and civilian
contractors, with additional expense,
waste of time and manpower.
Pooling and unifying the medical ser-
vices, engineering, workshops, supply,
etc., for all services would economise in
technical personnel, transport, accommo-
dation and equipment, especially in the
L. of C. areas.
Scientists should be more fully em-
ployed to investigate the implications of
new technological developments, if we
are to be geared for war at the outbreak,
and not some years after hostilities com-
mence. The speed, power and range of
weapons will continue to increase.
The strength, composition and organisa-
tion of the forces necessarily must be
within the financial capacity of the
nation, but it is a question not of whether
we can afford it, but whether we can
afford to do without it. Actually, com-
bined control would make for economy.
The Supreme Commander and the
C.-in-C. of each service would each re-
quire a combined staff, trained in the
technique of all services. The Supremo
could be appointed for, say, two years in
rotation, the C.-in-Cs. for four years
in command of their own services, where-
upon they would be eligible for selection
for the Supreme appointment. Repre-
sentatives of Supply, Munitions, Man-
power, Allied Works could be called in
as consultants.
One “Minister for the Armed Forces”
only would be necessary (preferably not
an overworked Prime Minister) possessed
of vision, enthusiasm, a full knowledge
of Empire foreign policy and strategy,
and a determination to co-operate closely
with New Zealand, the Americans
and the Dutch in maintaining security
in the Pacific.
In no circumstances must he or his civil
staff usurp the functions of the Supreme
Commander or the Service C.-in-Cs., as
happened to General Blarney and Air
Vice-Marshal Bostock. — Three Wars

Rehabilitation
A young R.A.A.F. officer who had
applied for training as a dental mechanic
found a registered dental surgeon who
agreed to train him. After the usual
silence by the Rehabilitation people, he
, was told that, because enough dental
mechanics to satisfy the trade for the next
five years were already seeking employ-
ment, he had better apply for another
course.
He applied for woolclassing, with the
same result. There was a firm willing to
train him but, according to Rehabilitation
authorities, the trade was filled to absorp-
tion for the next five years.
What authority have the Rehabilitation
people to refuse training after a firm has
already agreed to provide it? — Swaddy

Red Cross P.-0.-W. Funds
As one of the p.-0.-w. in Malaya I
know that the per capita expenditure of
the Red Cross upon many prisoners-of-
war was almost negligible. The order of
the Supreme Court of Victoria relating
to the disposal of money collected for
that purpose (B. 3/7/’46) was apparently
applied to another object under the doc-
trine of cypres. By that doctrine, where
the intention of a donor cannot be ex-
actly carried out —a typical instance being
where the intended beneficiaries have
gone out of existence—the moneys are
applied so far as possible according to
the original intention so frustrated.
The amount involved (over a million
pounds) was so that the matter
should not have been decided ex parte.
There are other ways in which the moneys
might have been applied more agreeably
to the donors’ intentions. The proceed-
ings were apparently conducted on the
assumption that there are not now in ex-
istence any intended beneficiaries of the
gifts; that is a questionable proposition.
The propriety of proceeding upon such an
assumption is open to doubt.
I know from speaking to individual
donors that the proposed disposition is
very different from what they would have
desired. If the contention is correct that
there are now in existence no intended
beneficiaries, then no expenditure upon
ex-prisoners made after the war ended
could be justified. But if such a narrow
view had been adopted by the Red Cross
there would have been a public outcry.
It is an entirely artificial application
of the doctrine to presume that general
Red Cross purposes are fitter objects of
expenditure than, for example, the widows
and children of the men who perished on
the Burma-Siam railway, and who never
derived any benefit whatever from the
moneys collected. —T. D. (S.A.).
India
An Indian lady now in Australia, Miss
Paranjpye, has made the surprising dis-
covery that “religious conflict in India has
been caused by British policy over the
past 30 years.” Before that, on the
same authority, “Moslems and Hindus
lived together as harmoniously as the
different religious denominations in Aus-
tralia.”
The lady is a graduate of Oxford, but
she seems never to have heard of the
terrible sack of Chitor, in which almost
every man was killed, while the women
immolated themselves by fire in an under-
ground cavern. That was in the thirteenth
century, some time before British rule
began. So were the conquests of Akbar
and his family.
The Australian historian W. K. Han-
cock has written, “Even in their most
exaggerated expressions, the divisions be-
tween the different branches of the Chris-
tian church are not comparable with the
rifts of religious faith which go down to
the very foundations of Indian society.
For in India, religious faith is still the
most powerful determinant of community
values and allegiance.”
Miss Paranjpye’s remarks about
“Indian industries going to the wall” are
on a par with the rest. The British
brought prosperity to traders and work-
men such as they had never experienced
before. In 1939 India’s exports to
Britain were £43£ millions, her imports
from Britain £34.8 millions. The greater
part of her trade was with countries out-
side the British Empire. Most countries
would be only too glad to share “ruin”
on such generous terms. —E. and O.E.
(Tas.).
Trieste
The city of Trieste, with its fine port,
has been built and developed entirely by
Italian capital and Italian engineering
skill. In thought and speech it is entirely
Italian. The surrounding country is Yugo-
slav. If you want a bottle of wine to go
with your Sunday picnic lunch five miles
out of the city, you must ask for it in
Slav speech. The port itself serves Austria
and the Balkan countries much morfe than
it serves Italy.
When Italy surrendered to the Allies,
the crews of three Italian submarines in
Singapore Harbor were arrested by their
erstwhile allies and many were im-
prisoned with their former enemies, with
whom, incidentally, they got along quite
well. Some of them, from Trieste, said
that Italy would lose that city and
that it should be made into a free port
under international control. It seems
strange that it should have taken the
Council of Foreign Ministers several
months to arrive at the same very obvious
conclusion. — X-Changi (N.S.W.).
T.B. Treatment
The Federal Government has decided
to make an annual grant of £250,000 to
assist needy T.B. sufferers who must
leave their job to undergo treatment.
In England the emphasis is on re-
habilitation, and interesting work is being
carried out, particularly at Papworth
village, seven miles from Cambridge. A
model settlement has been founded, with
modern treatment and facilities for tech-
nical education —principally in leather
work and printing. Patients are en-
couraged to take up a trade, and are
eligible for employment in the small fac-
tories attached to the sanatorium. Within
the settlement, living accommodation is
available for technical trainees and
factory workers.
In comparison, Australia’s £250,000
annual grant to unemployed sufferers is
simply a form of dole. The grant could
be used constructively to pay for a re-
habilitation scheme which would be of
permanent benefit, and, in the long run,
less costly.— Blue (Q.).
Nursing
“G.A.8.” (B. 26/6/’46) hasn’t the right
answer to nursing shortages. Not many of
the aspiring Nightingales have the neces-
sary temperament and strength of char-
acter which are required by the profession,
and which are often a rude awakening to
the probationer. Would “G.A.8.” like to
have the responsibility of accurate nurs-
ing left to a 17-year-old nurse? The nurs-
ing of the very sick calls not only for
theory but for experienced practical
“Want to buy a pair of handcuffs, Sarge ?”
knowledge, and no amount of book work
will provide that.
Three years sufficed to make a nurse
during the war, but compared with the
standard of the previous curriculum, which
demanded four years’ practical training,
these few years were not sufficient to give
nurses experience in theatre work and
X-ray. Some of our present trained
nurses sadly lack that knowledge, and are
finding it most necessary in hospital work,
That is why many nurses don’t apply for
work in small "country hospitals where a
good general knowledge of all the
branches of the profession is demanded.
If the Government equips all hospitals
with modern X-ray plants, good theatres
and small laboratories, and if the training
staff have some home comforts in their
quarters, girls will not think so badly of
hospital work. There is no dead-end to
the nursing profession, and when condi-
tions are made easier many of the girls
in offices and factories will give up their
jobs at 18 and begin their training.
—Q’land Nurse (Q.).
Nobody in W.A. begrudges the nurses
their recent rise, but there should be stan-
dard conditions for nurses throughout
Australia, making it impossible for hospi-
tals to bid against one another for their
services. A large Westralian country hos-
pital, already understaffed, has just lost
five nurses and sisters to better-paid jobs
in the Eastern States, and the residents
of that town are left badly in the lurch.
—S. Groper (W.A.).
“Macquarie’s Street”
The Bulletin (3/7/’46) is correct in
stating that Sydney Hospital is a strong
and robust building, situated where it
should be —in the centre of the city.
London, one of the greatest ports in the
world, has several large general hospitals
in its centre —St. Bartholomew’s, the
oldest, still stands where it was built in
1123.
From the completion of Sydney Hos-
pital, in July, 1817, when it was known
as a convict hospital under civil control,
Governments have been reluctant to
reserve the whole of such an ideally
situated building for the care of the
sick. Four wards were given to the
Supreme Court and to provide a
studio for Lewen, the artist. Despite
overcrowding the Law Courts were
not removed until 1823. Six years
later the residence of the principal sur-
geon was taken by the Government, and
is today known as Parliament House.
The Mint, one of the few remaining
buildings of old Sydney, was originally
the southern wing of Sydney Hospital.
Half the charm and interest of London
lies in its historic buildings with
the history of all England in their
ancient stones. The Mint and Sydney
Hospital have an identical association
with the City of Sydney.—E. T. (N.S.W.).
Congratulations on that article on the
proposed destruction of the historic
buildings in Macquarie-street.
The only surviving - founder of the
Royal Australian Historical Society, in-
augurated in 1901, I have always been a
consistent advocate for the preservation

from the outraged feelings of people who

generations, who will assuredly blame us
for robbing them of these fine old relics.
We are losing them steadily. There
was the soulless destruction of that fine
old mansion, The Rangers, at Mosman,

old English manor house. J?uraeKi

The Queensland Meat Strike
It was curiously ineffectual. No one
went short of meat and some of the
strikers were straggling back before
everyone was officially “out.” Two rail-
way unions threatened to strike, but in the
face of a determined stand by the Hanlon
Government they thought better of it
and contented themselves with a mild ban
on bacon factory products.
The wharfies came out, of course, and
so did the coalies, but not very enthusi-
astically Some small mines in the Rose-
wood area continued working, and, as the
railways are using coal from these mines,
a party of organisers went to the district
seeking better “solidarity.” Queensland
coalminers have a good record over the
last two decades and the organisers did
not get the reception they expected. One
of them lost his temper and was ill-
advised enough to sneer at the religious
beliefs of some of his hearers. At the
mention of “horse-troughs” and “duck-
ings” he apologised in a manner typical
of his kind when faced by really angry
men.
After another speaker had been told to
cut out the Commo propaganda and ex-
plain what the strike was about, there
were suggestions of a secret ballot and
only a prompt closure of the meeting pre-
vented a motion to that effect. No union
organiser who has been trained in a Red
school believes in secret ballots. Neither,
I read, does N.S.W. Premier McKell, and
P.M. Chifley contemplates all strikes from
his faraway fence.’ — Five by Two (Q.).
The Murray
Murraysiders appreciate The Bulle-
tin’s support of the M.V.D.L. (B.
26/6/’46), but they shudder at the descrip-
tion “great brown river.” Alarmists
to the contrary, those who know it best
recognise the catchment as being in pretty
good trim still —the crystal clearness of
the stream at almost all times is sufficient
proof. Compare the Murray’s clearness
at Tocumwal with the milkiness of the
’Bidgee at Wagga or Narrandera!
Valley dwellers are not content to
leave the preservation of the catchment
to chance. Their aim is the establish-
ment of an authority comparable with the
T.V.A. to preserve it as a national asset
for all time. A Valley population of
5,000,000 is not too high an aim, but it
can’t be done simply by “increasing the
capacity of the dam” —the increased
capacity would be sufficient only to pro-
vide for existing irrigation settlements
and limited additional irrigation districts
at present being developed on both sides
of the stream.
Murraysiders know that the Valley’s
future is tied up with the diversion to the
Murray of part of the Snowy waters.
This would permit both generation of
tremendous electric energy for industry,
and intensive irrigation development of
the thirsty down-river country as far as
S.A.
The ’Bidgee men, however, seem to
have the ear of the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment, though Victoria is alive to its
riparian interests in the Snowy waters.
A fact-finding committee is now to in-
dicate the best use of the disputed waters.
—R.O.R. (N.S.W.).
Irrigation for Western N.S.W.
A large dam could be constructed on
the Western Slopes of the Blue Moun-
tains, and from it water could be piped
to the Macquarie River, some miles be-
yond Dubbo. Thus fresh water would
increase the natural flow of this stream.
Below the point where the pipeline
emptied into the river, another large dam
could be constructed, and the water regu-
lated so as to ensure a constant flow in
the river, which passes through the heart
of the western sheep country.
Along the river could be established
model farms, enough of them to grow
lucerne to keep the sheep properties
throughout the western plains going in
a long drought. There would also be
water for supplying sheep stations, for
station use and sheep drinking-troughs.
Some graziers in these parts argue that
the river banks are too porous to hold
water, as witness their own pathetic mud
holes on the Macquarie and Bogan rivers,
and such like capricious streams; but
with a constantly flowing supply the banks
would gradually take up and become im-
pervious to water. — Clansman (R.A.A.F.).
Professional Sport
After 25 years’ experience I’m inclined
to agree with The Bulletin’s criticisms
of professional sport, but many amateur
bodies have forced lads into the profes-
sional ranks.
Outside the city areas there is little
scope for the average healthy youngster
to test his physical prowess without in-
curring the risk of professionalism.
Amateur athletic clubs are practically un-
known in the country and every sports
meeting includes athletic events for trif-
ling cash prizes. Participation in these
places competitors on the same level as
professionals who live on the big-money
meetings, and they may be banned from
all affiliated amateur games.
Big-time professional sport is not really
sport. It should be classed as entertain-
ment, with a heavy super-tax on the in-
come of the stars. The only sport worth
anything to the country is that which
encourages national physical fitness by
active participation in games. — Stanus
(N.S.W.).
Country Towns
If convenience, healthful surroundings
and cheapness of living were the sole con-
siderations, many people would live in
country towns (B. 3/7/’46).
But man shouldn’t live by bread alone.
With the possible exception of Bathurst
(N.S.W.), all country towns I’ve seen are
architectural monstrosities where nothing
of importance ever happens, except when
Mr. Spinks, the draper, “releases” a new
stock of dress materials in his “em-
porium.”
Then there is the snobbery. In the
city one can maintain several circles of
friends, some antipathetic to the others.
In the country you can only accept your
rightful place in the social pyramid of
which, as a rule, the bank managed
forms the worthy apex. For litera-
ture there is the threepenny library, full
of “romance,” detective stories and
Westerns; for music, the radio. City
suburbs are no better in these respects,
but one can at least get away from them.
In the present stage of their develop-
ment, country towns live entirely in a
material world, and their attractions do
not outweigh the opportunity, which the
city sometimes affords, of being able to
live and move in the world of ideas.—
I. G. M. (N.S.W.).
One reason why most people prefer to
live in the cities (B. 3/ 7 / ’46) -is that
the variety of employment available to
youths in country towns is very limited.
The N. S. Wales coastal town in which
I live is typical. Young men can look
forward only to jobs as shop assistants
and as general hands in butter and cheese
factories, with a remote chance of becom-
ing a barman or a pub rouseabout. Even
the s.-p. business is blocked to them.
Apprentice bakers, tailors, dressmakers,
motor mechanics and the like must look
further afield when their apprenticeship
ends.
Although sufficient male and female
labor is available for several small fac-
tories, and building costs are low, manu-
facturers do not appear to be interested
—Stanus (N.S.W.).
Price-control
War-time price-fixing in America has
never been as effective nor as widespread
as in this country and, on official figures,
the cost of living has risen far higher
there, with a greater amount of black-
marketing.
With the suspension of controls, rents
soared by as much as 100 per cent.; food
and clothing retail prices made a similar
spectacular rise. The internal value of
the dollar rapidly depreciated, and thous-
ands of employees were unable to buy
the ordinary necessities of life.
These things deeply concern Australia,
not only as an illustration of the results of
a too-sudden lifting of price-control, but
as a warning of the probable effects of an
American currency collapse on world
economy that would be the forerunner
to another universal depression.
The lesson is that the only road back
to stability is the hard way, through solid
work, increasing enterprise, reduced taxa-
tion and all-round national economies.
Price-controls must be released gradually
and only as the general supply of com-
modities increases to meet the spending
power of the community.—T. C. A.
(A.C.T.).
Tobacco in the Far North
In any agricultural expansion scheme
undertaken in Queensland the develop-
ment of the Laura tobacco lands should
be included. Laura is 67 miles inland
from Cooktown by rail, and one grower
has been raising tobacco with marked
success for a number of years. His leaf
has brought very satisfactory prices.
The climate is ideal for tobacco, and
nemitoids and blue mould are practically
non-existent. Even light frost is un-
known. The minimum winter tempera-
ture is 60 degrees, and in summer the
maximum averages 95 degrees. The rain-
fall is from 40in. to 50in., most of it
falling in the summer months.
There are 154 agricultural perpetual-
lease blocks available for selection at an
annual rent of 9/20d. per acre in the
Laura area —all situated on proved to-
bacco land. On all these blocks irriga-
tion would be available, as surface water
in rivers and lagoons is abundant. Other
suitable tobacco land covers 1200 square
miles within handy reach of the Laura
railhead.
The Laura area is not isolated. There
is road and rail communication with
Cooktown, which is linked by regular
shipping and air services with Cairns
and Brisbane. With the establishment
of an agricultural industry at Laura, the
opening of adjacent undeveloped areas
would be automatic. So also would be
the completion of the Cook Highway
“Mr. Appleton, meet Miss Popsy Brown—and now let us proceed."
northwards to Cooktown and the con-
struction of the Laura-Mungana rail link,
which would pass right through the centre
of the Laura tobacco lands.
When planning settlement in Queens-
land the Bureau of Rural Development
should give every consideration to the
Cook Shire Council’s recent enlightening
report on the Laura tobacco lands. —Gip
(N.Q.).
The Sikh
“Puyyaka’s” enthusiastic uncritical
defence of the Sikh (B. 19/6/’46) does
not alter my view that he has never pro-
duced anything great, and that he is a
grand fighter—when properly led. Where
is the Sikh poet to rival, or even approach,
Tagore among the Hindus, or Iqbal
among the Mussulmen, or even Mrs.
Naiyudu, the modem poet of the Hindus?
Where is the reformer to approach Ram
Mohan Roy, the great Bengali social re-
former? Where are their great modem
political or religious leaders?
The Sikh religion began some four
centuries ago as an attempt to modernise
Hinduism under the influence of Unitarian'
ideas. It has slipped a lot since then.
There have been schisms which have
seen reversion of a great many of the
sects to Hindu practices—caste for in-
stance. The Golden Temple at Amritsar
is a fine edifice, but there is nothing
original in its architecture —it is a mixture
of Hindu and Mogul styles as is the
electric Granth.
The Sikhs, controlled by Govind Singh,
were freebooters who took advantage of
the decay of the Moguls to overrun a
great deal of the Punjab. Their adven-
tures altered the complexion of the Sikh
religion from an ascetic to a martial cult.
The army of Govind Singh was composed
of Sikhs, Punjabi Mussulmen and Hindus,
with a smattering of Gurkha, Hindustani
and Afghan mercenaries. That was the
composition of the army which challenged
the British in the Punjab in the two Sikh
wars __l 845-46 and 1848-49—and the
composition of Sikh regiments of the
Indian Army has been Sikh, Punjabi
Mussulmen and Hindu ever since. The
Sikhs got such a thrashing in the second
Sikh war that they became admiringly
loyal recruits to British arms.
To support my point that their little
claim to Sikhistan is not taken seriously
among major Indian groups, let me quote
the population of their religious head-
quarters, Amritsar: Sikhs 399,000, Mus-
lims 524,000, Hindus 176,000.
I admire the Sikh, too, but I can see
(and have seen) his weaknesses, which
“Puyyaka” ignores.— Shere Khan (Vic.).
The R.S.L.
Surely “Ex-Nav(B)” is not implying
that all members of the R.S.L. have the
bond of “having faced death together”
(B. 29/5/’46). Thousands of them never
heard a shot fired in anger. An army
officer attending a school in Brisbane
went beyond the coastal limit for a few
hours. He is now a member of the
R.S.L. Possibly that’s an exception, but.
what of the Port Moresby, Morotai
and Lae base troops who had jobs little
more arduous than base troops at Syd-
ney Showground? What of all the three-
month “visitors” to the Islands?
Just before the war ended two of bur
men serving detention were forwarded to
detention barracks at Lae so that we
could collect them on our way to Singa-
pore. They were later returned to the
mainland and given R.A.S. badges, and
they were eligible for ribbons and the
R.S.L.
In latter days of war, training exercises
at Jungle Schools on the mainland pro-
vided more risks of death and injury
than some “returned” men ever faced.
The R.S.L. is splitting hairs. When a
man volunteered for the A.I.F. in 1914-
18, it meant that he went overseas ; in
this war he did not know where he would
go. Armored Corps and Paratroop per-
sonnel —more worthy of R.S.L. member-
ship than many present members —have
formed their own association. An old
army axiom is “concentration of force,”
and service personnel are wasting their
potentiality in “penny packet” clubs. The
R.S.L. should have admitted all overseas
volunteers. —C. S. (N.S.W.).
My schooldays were ridden with
penalties for coarse, slovenly or distorted
speech we “could of” used if we “didn’t
hafta” realise what school and home re-
action would be (B. 3/7/’46). Attempts
to pass on#that training now are blocked
at every turn by the influence of radio,
comic-strips and cinema, which could
have been our greatest help. We teachers
do our best, but it is disheartening to feel
like Canute on the sea-beach all the time.
—K. A. (N.S.W.).

When war ended Australia was pro-
ducing large quantities of galvanised iron
and fencing materials, and must have had
a considerable reserve stored for service
needs. Now farmers and builders are told
there is a shortage of these materials.
Where have accumulated stocks gone?
—Plain Australian (Vic.).

I posted a MS. in a plain business en-
velope and paid postage. Rejected,
it was returned in a similar envelope bear-
ing a s}d. stamp. I posted it again and
this time it was returned with a 6jd.
stamp. The third time I queried the post-
age at a different post office; it was still
B}d. Once more the MS. came home,
this time by book post for 2}d. Will
someone tell me why it costs B£d. to post
a MS. to Melbourne and either 2jd., s\d.
or 6|d. to return it to the country?—

Why does the press play into the hands
of Calwell and Ward by giving them all
the publicity they want? Both these gen-
tlemen hold seats which are theirs for life
provided the “Conservative” press con-
tinues to slate them—if the press decided
on a conspiracy of silence and used only
their Ministerial rank they would be the
two most injured persons in Australia.
They both work on the adage that any
publicity is good, and the more the Oppo-
sition press slates them the better it serves
them in their own electorates. — Recco
