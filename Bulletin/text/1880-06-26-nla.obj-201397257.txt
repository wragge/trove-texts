The Survival of the Fittest.
Dickens, in one of his happiest efforts, inciden-
tally alludes to a charitable society organised in
London for the purpose of supplying rod
pocket-handkerchiefs and warm underclothing to
the unclad children of Central Africa. Not so
unpractical is the scheme of the Rev. Mr.
Gribble, noticed in our last, for the ameliora-
tion of the condition of the Australian black.
Analagous in its object to the institution
which has flourished for many years in connection
with the Roman Catholic Mission at Camden, it
is common ground on which all sects may work
harmoniously in accord with the spirit of the
Rounder of Christianity. As to the necessity
for action in this direction there can be no ques-
tion, and as to its justice, if possible, ,still less.
Yet a vigorous correspondence which has been
raging for some time in the columns of the
Queenslander shows that there aiS? s o v , 110
are not ashapied openly to adv o eate wholesale
extermination as the speediest
way out of the difficulty. One
writer, who takes the un-
compromising pseudonym of
“Never-Never,” while depre-
cating milder measures, says
distinctly : —I maintain that
the blacks deserve shooting,”
and further on he adds, signi-
ficantly enough, if somewhat
obscurely, that “the matter
had better be left to settle itself
in the usual way —by the sur-
vival of the fittest.”
Restricted Responsibility.
The Chinese question, in so far
as regards its relation to the
colonies, is properly a colonial,
not an Imperial, one. We differ
from the views expressed by the
writer of a late sub-leader in
the S. M. Herald on this sub-
ject. The principles of Respon-
sible Government would seem
essentially to require that its
action be entirely unfettered by
any circumstances or events
foreign to the State in which it
is exercised. The treatment of
China by the mother country
in the matter of the opium
trade, and the opening of the
ports of the former, is an ob-
jection often quoted against
local legislation affecting the
immigration of Chinese. But
if the action of the Colonial
Legislature is to be thus circum-
scribed and bound within limits
by influences beyond its con-
trol, its freedom and responsi-
bility in a matter virtually af-
fecting the welfare of its charge
evidently much restricted.
Now, the provisions of the Im-
perial Treaty with China do, as
a matter of fact, so interfere
with free legislation on this sub-
ject. However, a resolution
which has been passed by the
Assembly, moving the Govern-
ment to communicate with the
home authorities as to the ad-
visability of modifying this
Treaty, will perhaps pave the
way for freer action and com-
bined representations by the
different colonial Governments,
and should the overtures of the
Ministry be successful, they will
doubtless provide sufficiently
strong arguments for the re-
consideration of the Treaty in
so far as it will affect the
colonies.
A Mistake and its Remedy.
A sane man only sells Ids patrimonial estate
under pressure of embarrassment, and as a last
resource to “raise the wind.” If Ids object be
merely to secure a regular income for current
expenses and to provide against contingencies,
he sub-lets it on improving leases. What applies
to an individual in this case should apply to the
State, but our statesmen think otherwise. They
recklessly sold the land of this colony, and treated
the proceeds as current revenue—actually went
so far as to base a fiscal policy on the tint a Cur-,
nished oy the returns of these s des before
fallacy was exposed by Mr. Sit art. .At the close
of 1877 a surplus of upwards of Ck()9!),000 ster-
ling filled the Treasury chests ; 41251,009 is now
all that remains of that sum —the difference
having been diesipated in van >us ways. To
rectify the blunders, a system of heavy taxation
must necessarily soon be enforced, of which the
Stamp Act is the forerunner. Until within the
last few days, however, that Bill has been shelved
by the Ministry, lor convenient, well-known
reasons connected with “ irresponsible hostility.”
That the supply of cash might not fall off mean-
while, they fostered their abnormal revenue by
administering a judicious fillip to the sale of land
/-reducing the price for that purpose from
twenty-five shillings to twenty per acre.

q.i KiiNsi.A.Miui, ihose imitations ot onr native
police system attempted by the Turks which
aroused so much indignation in England—that
the greatest exasperation in civilized
r. ll rope. I m*n our contemporary narrates a few
illi;Wonts hllVo occurred within the last
tb>rc or four years. We give this one as being
shor(c,-t. though by no means the most
disgraceful : “A man who accompanied a police
officer in a northern district was present at a
raid upon some blacks. He shared the officer’s
tent, ibe t coopers were of course round them,
They ha I a prize, a young black girl, little more
than a child. This "man, an old bushnnm hut
not so seasoned as our officers are could not
sleep because of the yells, cries and moans of
the unhappy child as each brutal savage clad in
the uniform of our Government, violated lier in
turn. They did not finish bv shoo tin her but
left her in the morning in a, dazed agonized' con-
dition fur her tribe to find her -aud'ho disposed
towards friendship with the whites by the
sp u-.acle.” The article from which we'quote
appeared in the issue of June .7 and coit-
eluded thus:—“Wo equip Ibis force, and send
it out to do the work which is described in these
columns. We refuse (o have any report of what
is done; all wo ask is that they shall do what
they please and say nothing. Wo arm ferocious
savages and send them out under single white
men, who are only blamed if they are dilatory in
shooting blacks.” 'Jhe QUEENSLANDER at last,
though late in the day, lias determined “ to do
the right.” The publication of these tales will be
most unpopular with a certain influential section.
Powerful influence will be used in order to stop
further exposures. But we know the proprietary
and feel confident that the cost has been calcu-
lated and that having put their hands to the
plough, no consideration will induce them to
turn back till this foul stain is erased.
Sir Henry Parkes, K.C.M.G.
There are men in distinguished public positions
of whom it is extremely difficult to write bio.
graphical notices. The professional politician is
pre-eminently one of these. Ever on the watch for
changes in the political atmosphere, cautious
through habit and selfish through his needs, he is
neither a desirable subject for criticalanalysis.nor a
safe one for discriminating appraisement. Of all
the public men iu this country Sir Henry Parkes
is the greatest puzzle to those who attempt to
gauge his moral and intellectual qualities. With
the exception of “ party ” politics, there is not a
thing that he ever touched that he did not mar—
not an effort he ever made that did not prove a
failure. As an artisan ho could
only eke out a bare livelihood ; as
a journalist he so mismanaged
the affairs of his newspaper that it
had to collapse, and that with
such an ignominious display of
incapacity that that portion of
the public which was willing to
support a second daily morning
paper shurnk for years from the
responsibility. During his mer-
cantile career Sir Henry gave
sufficient indications of his want
of tact and experience, and more
than once succumbed to those
embari’assmonts which are ordin-
arily the outcome of incapacity
to deal with commercial matters.
In the region of party politics he
has fared better, although it took
him ton years to gain a status in
the Parliamentary fore-rank, and
has strained his best mental
powers since to keep the position
to which he then attained. Al-
though diversified, the facts of
his life are not interesting.
Amongst other failures was his
poetry ; and to that may be added
his oratory, which is of a:
laboured and pretentious kind;
but he can nevertheless make
vigorous statements and support
a measure he understands with
a force and point that would en-
title him to be heard in any
deliberative assembly. He was
born at Stonoleigh, in Warwick-
shire, on the 27th May, 1815,
and is consequently in his sixty-
sixth year. He received the
barest rudiments of education
at Kenilworth and Gloucester,
and was apprenticed to a trade
when eleven years old. During
his apprenticeship the high
moral qualities ho really does
possess—self-controlandpatience
—were healthily developed, and
a taste for reading led him to the
study of many groat social and
political questions. The Me-
chanics’ Institute at Gloucester
may be looked upon as the real
school —the alma mater —where
his rough intellect was polished
and his uncouth manners re-
fined. He immigrated to this
colony in 1839, and soon found
employment in the iron-store
of the late Mr. Burdekin, and
afterwards at the foundry of the
Messrs. Russell. He went into
business on his own account as a
toy-dealer, in Hunter-street, in
1813; and there he began to
make a reputation as a politician,
if not a political thinker. Busi-
ness was never very brisk at his
shop so there was plenty of time
for gossip—and, it may bo
added, no lack of gossippers.
Ho hailed for Robert Lowe and
became a trumpeter of other
men’s views on the subject of
transportation. The want of a
liberal morning paper was keenly
felt in 1848, when the Herald
THE HON. SIR HENKY PASSES, K.C.M.G., COLONIAL .SEJTETANY OP N.S.IV. (Prom a Photo, by Boyd.)


became the mouthpiece of the squatting and
mercantile interest, and the indefatigable Parkes
came to the rescue in 1850. In that year he started
the Empire, which he issued at first thrice a week,
but soon after published daily. It was his good
fortune to secure able writers from the beginning ;
and amongst others, independently of the report-
ing staff, who gave “ strength and beauty” to the
original articles, for nearly seven years, were the
late Edwai-d Butler, Robert Lowe, William
Forster, W. G. Pennington, Frank Fowler, and
others whose names it would be invidious to
mention. The new journal struck no uncertain
note on the ear of the community; and it
certainly contributed greatly to educate the pub-
lic mind while the question of Responsible Govern-
ment was before the country. It won for its pro-
prietor and nominal editor a popularity that his
own writings would never have elicited. He had
long watched for an opportunity of entering the
Parliamentary arena, and he accordingly opposed
Mr. Thurlow for the representation of Sydney in
1853, but the latter was too strong for him, being
an old Sydney favourite. When Mr. Kemp, how-
ever, was brought forward in 185-1, the friends of
Liberalism made a better rally, and returned the
subject of this notice by a large majority. In
1856 he was elected to the new Assembly, where
he has since, with vai’ying fortunes, been a promi-
nent figure except during the interval when he
went to England, accompanied by Mr. W. B.
Dailey, as Immigration lecturer. From its incu-
batipn to its last stage that expedition was a mere
political job, pure and simple—if a job of any kind
can be pure and simple. In 1858 Mr. Parkes began
to assume the airs of the “ coming man,” a crea-
tion of his own fancy, which he once, with pre-
posterous vanity, word-painted in the Assembly
for the edification of honorable members, most of
whom laughed at the intolerable conceit
and transparent vanity of an ordinary
member arraying an imaginary statesman
with such attributes that anybody not men-
tally blind could see that Henry Parkes (according
to himself) would one day be the reality. At last
the hour of reward —of political beatification—
came: he was offered and accepted office as
Colonial Secretary in Sir James Martin’s Ministry
(1866), —an Administration whose parliamentary
triumph was the passing of the Public Schools Act,
to which Sir Henry Parkes devoted much thought
and zeal; but of which, in its main features, he is
not the author. With a manfulness that did him
great credit, ho stood up (iu 1868) for the rights of
his old friend, Mr. Duncan, and resigned sooner
than become a party to that gentleman’s unjust
deprivation of the office of Collector of Customs,
which he had discharged for many years with credit
to himself and advantage to the country. But Sir
Henry turned up again—a conspicuous central
figure—when the Martin-Robortson Ministry was
defeated, and played bis trump card soon after-
wai’ds by offering the office of Chief Justice,
vacant by the retirement of Sir Alfred Stephen,
to Sir James Martin, who accepted it. The cool,
high-handed way he dealt on that occasion with
Mr. Butler, his own Attorney-General, was the
subject of general and generally censorious remark.
He and his colleagues came to grief over the out-
law Gardiner’s release; they resigned, and re-
mained in the cool shades of Opposition for a little
more than two years. His knighthood followed
his second Premiership ; and as it was known that
ha had refused the inferior distinction of C.M.G.,
a good many barbed jeux d'esprit were shot at his
vanity. The rejection of himself and Sir John
Robertson at the last genera' elections —their
subsequent return for Canterbury and Mudgee,
repectively—their oscillation towards each other
for purposes of coalition and pecuniary advantage
—the resignation by Sir John of his seat in the
Assembly—his position in connexion with the
present Administration —and the extraordinary
spirit of mutual admiration that has sprung up
between him and his foe of 20 years—are matters
of history so recent that to dwell on them
would be to remind the reader of occurrences
he knows as well as the writer. Whatever may be
said about the exigencies that demand a strong
Government, the public conscience received a
shock at the entente cordiale so suddenly estab-
lished between the pair of inveterate Parliamen-
tary antagonists. Sir Henry Parkes is constitu-
tionally shifty, fond of assuming solemn airs to
conceal a real cowardice of nature, hut despotic
to the last endurable degree when well backed np.
His subtle vanity makes him exceedingly sensitive
to sneer and sarcasm, and he takes offence at
trifles like a child. He hg,s, however, been indus-
trious, persevering, temperate, and studious,
and he now enjoys the honours and rewards of
a life zealously devoted to the public and to
himself!
The late Mr. Farley, Dr. Vause and the
Daily Telegraph.
CHAPTER I.
Mr. Farley wag well known in Sydney.
He went out one evening and fell down in a fit.
While lying insensible on the footpath a
prowler came along and stole his watch.
Then a policeman came up and took Mr. Farley
to the Infirmary.
The policeman didn’t know Mr. Farley.
Neither did the doctors.
Neither did the nurses.
The policeman searched Mr. Farley’s pockets
and to«k away all his papers—as was usual in
such cases.
Chapter 11.
The policeman saw from Mr. Farley’s papers
that his address was “ Forest Lodge.”
Ho went to Forest Lodge, or, next best thing,
said he did.
He didn’t find Mr. Farley’s residence.
Had he been looking for an unfortunate baker’s
boy who had embezzled eighteenpence he’d cer-
tainly have found him.
Then Mr. Farley, who had been properly at-
tended, and had been insensible from the first,
died.
A post-mortem was held.
No marks whatever of external violence.
Cranial arteries extensively diseased.
Big blood clot in brain.
Reasonable inference —sanguineous apoplexy.
Chapter HI.
Daily Telegraph reporter came along.
Big sensation sticking out.
Daily Telegraph reporter had a grudge
against resident doctors.
A Daily Telegraph proprietor is an hospital
doctor.
Shocking negligence on part of Dr. Yause.
Didn’t believe his evidence —nor his letter —but
gave no reason for not believing them.
Clear case of wilful murder.
Same old sensational game as it used to bo in
Melbourne.
Mr. Farley’s watchguard broken—clear evi-
dence of robbery with violence.
Chapter IV.
Enquiry held and Dr. Yause believed.
Chapter V.
Why didn’t the police put a shilling advertise-
ment, describing Mr. Farley, in the Herald ?
The Success of The Bulletin.
Everyone will be glad to hear that The Bulletin
is a pronounced success. In the short space
of five months the circulation has risen from
5000 to 10,000, and our advertising support
has increased fourfold. This flood of fortune
our own office is unable to bear, and we have,
in consequence, secured one whole floor or
flat in the splendid premises of Messrs. John
Woods & Co., of Bridge-street, for the future
production of the paper. Our readers will
find the typographical and artistic excellence
of The Bulletin, improved, if possible,
and its literary attractions fully maintained.
The Bulletin, the success of which is
admittedly without a parallel in the colonies,
has won its way on its own merits, and the
proprietary only hope for further success on
that basis.
Some Notes about The Bulletin.
It lias outstripped all other papers.
In five months it has run up to 10,000
copies.
It has livened up the Sydney newspapers.
It has been good enough for the Evening
News to imitate.
It has induced tiie Mail and the Town and
Country to improve their engravings.
It has made them all use better ink and better
paper.
It has won approval from every journal
throughout the interior of this colony.
It has been “noticed” by the Aegus, the
Australasian, the Brisbane Courier, S. A. Register,
and the Advertiser, but not by the Mail and Town
and Country, though, doubtless, these latter have
been taking stock for some time.
It has won its way into Melbourne, 350 copies
copies going each week to one agent.
It has got a hold on Brisbane, and as to Rock-
hampton, it sends there fifty to one of any other Syd-
ney newspaper.
It has reached Auckland, Wellington, Christ-
church, and Dunedin.
It has set Hobart Town and Launceston
ablaze, and has got three Adelaide judges on its list of
übscribers.
It has fifty booked subscribers in San Fran-
foisco.
Like sand through a sieve it passes through
the Sydney Post Office to friends at home in England,
Ireland and Scotland, to show that we are not all bush-
rangers or politicians out here.
It runs every other paper off the streets of
Sydney on the Friday and Saturday.
It sells for five nights running in the theatre.
It is frequently found in the pulpits on the
Monday.
It is filed in the Hebald office and cribbed
in the Evening News.
It gave the Twaddleoraph a start of five
months and overhauled it in three weeks.
The missionaries down among the dark men go
with the Bible in the one hand and The Bulletin in
other and the missionaries say “ The Bulletin is for
the heathen.”
It is stealthily bought by Sir Henry, and
openly read by Sir John.
No steamer or passenger boat sails without a
complete file.
It goes with remittances to Torres Straits and
to the Sonth Seas, and in bundles to New Caledonia.
It is just the paper a lot of fellows were
“about starting” in Sydney.
It is bent on 50 000, commencing in its second
grand rise with an edition of 5000 in Melbourne alone.
It is a paper which, if it does fail, will an-
nounce the mishap in a second edition.
It has turned a bailiff into a cash subscriber,
and pulled a convivial cigar with a bank manager the
same evening.
It is bought by the Evening News reporters,
and, in a hurry, is sometimes left on their desks.
And it is read by Alfred Bennett.
It knows the measure of most men—especially
little men.
It is devoted to the development of good men,
and the withering up of outsiders.
It’s not the fault of the paper if it’s not been
occupied as yet in the “ withering up ” business.
Frinstance, Ninny, John, and Hanlay.
It goes to the houses of the best men in
Sydney.
It has more ladv contributors than all the
other newspapers of Sydney put together.
And its owners are still under twenty-five. At
least, kc. ko.
It was good enough to enable a Melbourne man
to get buried on credit. He said be belonged to the
“live” paper, and was going on. The undertaker
billed us —“Travelling expenses, £10.”
We’ll have to, pay that debt some day.
It’ll not, however, be before we’ve done some
good in our own fashion.
And formed a heart at least in the people of
this great country.
PEEPS IN THE THEATRE.
Bt Quiz.
PEEP THE SEVENTH—A PAPER ON DRESS.
Dress is a subject that one must needs approach
daintily, look at micoscopically, pull to pieces homoeo-
pathically, and write up very dispassionately. Now, our
evening entertainments, especially our theatres, give
one a wide and varied picture on the subject. Take
a crowded, fashionable night at the “ Victoria,” wh en
there is a rush for the dress-circle and stalls, for the
Opera is popular if questionable or the ‘‘circle” and
“ stalls ” would not be crowded. On such a night the
“belles” of the past, present and future, are to be
seen in all their bravery. I notice one anxious mother,
with a whole bevy of daughters, closely scanning the
other sofas to see if any girls outshine hers. She
need not alarm herself, for one of her daughters, I
notice, wears diamond ear-rings; round her slender
throat a massive gold collar, from which hangs a locket
blazing with diamonds ; on her thin, unformed arms,
are bracelets also studded with brilliants. She is
very young and her childish figure looks weighed do wn
by jewels that would have better become her mother
or even her grandmother. If mothers only knew it,
there is beauty in youth that needs no adornment.
Nature supplies with no niggard hand all the jewels
that youth requires, but that flimsy changeable dame
called “ Fashion ” refuses to recognise them and prefers
to paint her rose while yet in the bud. There are plenty
of Australia’s fair daughters around us and the many-
hued costumes strike me as slightly incongruous with
the wearers. White, and white alone, is remarkable by
its total absence. There are plenty of pompadour girls
and pinafore girls, girls in silk and girls in satin, but
girls in white—none. The one color that gssentially
belongs to youth they eschew. True, the elaborately-
trimmed dresses they wear are far more costly and so
are their mothers’, the only difference being that while
youth in satin has her pretty neck and arms covered,
mamma in precisely the same material has a liberal
display of her plump bust and arms. With her it is
evidently neck or nothing. The principal head-dress
among the young to-night is a ‘‘bauble” they call a
“cap.” My grandmother wore caps, so did my grand-
father, so also did my baby sister, but none of these
could be called a cap of the “period. Now, girls hide
their abundant hair and deform their pretty faces by
appearing in a “grogram,” either fitting them as
tightly as a skull-cap, made of any bright satin that
least suits their complexion, or else they put on a huge
crumpled satin “mob-cap.” I have seen one or two
girls to whom those lai’ge caps gave an air of innocency
—but then nothing else could have done it. Others
again with nez retroussd, saucy blue eyes and dimpled
cheeks, wear a tragic “Jane Shore” or a “Marie
Stuart,” or else they dress their hair like South Sea
Islanders, wear shells in their ears, shells round their
necks and I am not sure thit they would not adopt the
whole costume were fashion only to lead the way. In
tact, so many barbaric innovations have been intro-
duced into a lady’s toilet that it is not at all unlikely
that a “ Zulu ” shield will become almost more neces-
sary than a fan. A girl already wears six or eight rows
of Roman pearls right round her throat like a “dog
collar,” combs her back hair to the top of her head,
twists it down the front parting and ties it down with
mock pearls, parts the front hair on one side, brings
her curls down on her temples like soldiers’ iove-locks,
or else she frizzes it like a West Indian nigger.
Fashion has become so exigeante in her demands, that
her satellites scarce know how to clothe themselves
scantily enough to please her. The tout-ensemble is
sometimes laughable enough. I might described the
toilets better if girls would not put on those parti-
coloured wool articles called “clouds.” There are
nights when the whole circle sits under a cloud, when
the daintiest costumes are lost and the fair wearers
sit swathed like so many mummies, although scarce a
breath of air is to be felt —probably because it is the
fashion.

New Guinea, he fouud that three out of his four children

The rev. gentleman who preached atSt. Andrew 3

morning service had only contributed £l6 (to the
Sunday school fund), and the afternoon and evening
services might bring £lO more, making in all £J>,
where £5O was wanted. It may be mentioned, by the
wny, that it takes ten able-bodied men to gather tho
collection in the Cathedral.
I had a talk the other day, writes our Brisbane
correspondent, with Baron Maclay. He knows, or
says he knows, a lot about the kanakas, aud he told me
why so many of our expiree labourers return from

for our colony, hut the want of love at their homes.
Every islander possesses a piece of land which ho culti-

prietors hardly care to associate. Hence his speedy
return to Queensland and tho white fellows “ ki-ki
(Anglice, “ tucker.”)
A little horsewhipping affair took place in
Hunter-stre*t, on Tuesday, when a young fellow,
sometime in the employ of the conductor of a certain
periodical, attempted to castigate his late master.
However, a real horsewhipping rarely comes off. _ Every
muscular Christian knows that a man who can’t fight
well should never strike another with a stick; that, «
you mean to punish a man with as little risk as possible
to yourself, you should “ hit him straight ” with your
left; but that, if you mean to “give and take,” the
right hand is the best weapon. The amateur flageilator
now alluded to evidently knew none of these things;
but as his Iriend couldn’t “mill” either, what was
intended to be a tragedy resolved itself into a small
hugging match, with much cry, little wool, and a gteU
deal of bad language. J
Tho museum at St. John’s College now contfejtß
rare specimens of tos.-ilized animals, aboriginals’
monts, ancient coins, ancient writings, aud numAie*
other “ tokens of the dead.” But amongst the most
curious specimens of archselogical remains, is »
mummy in a perfect state of preservation. It 1*
similar, so far as ths upper regions are concerned, to
the Anun-Ra. or ram headed god, the principal deify
of Thebes. The head, which has been preserved by its
being immersed in pitch liquefied at a very high tem-
I erature, thus giving it a dark colour, is iu a wonderful
state of preservation. On its forehead is the basilisk,
or royal serpent. The mummy is in a walking posh ion#
and the ’eet. which are about fourteen inches long, a' a
splendidly preserved while the hands, which are sur-
prisingly large, are decaying rapidly. From its cover-
ing the curator is of opinion that it is the emboli'eu
remains of a Christian inhabitant of Egypt, who lived o
little after the a o-dolic era. In its right hand it bears
a rude kind of plough, and over its shoulders is a coarse
c invass bag, which is supposed, as we learn from ancient
history, to have contained seed for the cultivation 01
the Elysian fields. The pedestal on which it stands i®
of rose-coloured granite, and the area of its base i*
a'gmt ten square feet. Its height, its large feet, and its
longh mds would lead one to believe it to be the muni my
of |a giraffe. To any of our readers of The BoiXE’n 11
who are inclined to inspect the remains of antiquity
it, would be an object of interestiugstudy. The mummy
was presented to the C liege museum by Sir Patrick
Coodham, 8.A., Trin. Coll. Dub.
PEN-AND-INK SKETCHES.
(Written for THE BULLETIN.)
[As the printer was “ wide of the mark ” last week, we
reprint the subjoined sketches in justice to our
esteemed contributor. —Ed. Bulletin.]
The Commercial Man
Has many characteristics and springs from many classes.
There is your clear-headed, money-making Scotchman,
whose natural genius to turn pence into shillings and
shillings into pounds has raised him from a very
obscnre station to the management of some large firm
in the city ho has lived in from his youth. His
position as a commercial man paves his way into
good society. He becomes a steady diner-out at great
men’s tables and occasionally, though not too often,
gathers them round his own mahogany, where they
fare sumptuously and drink freely. Another class is
your self-made man of business, who has risen gradually
in the social grade by his own efforts, from acting as
errand boy to sweeping out the shop, lightening his
labors by stolen games at “ Pitch-and-toss ” on the
pavement occasionally, rather unceremoniously
changed into a game of football, in which he plays the
thankless part of the ball and his master’s heavy foot
administers the kick. By dint of saving and turning
his little hoard to account with always the fixed idea of
making the most out of everything, he rises steadily in
his master’s favor. He even sometimes ventures to
give advice, and, having a clever head, keeps moving
on until, with hands deep in his pockets, he stands at
his shop door, a straw between his lips—calculating, with
his shrewd eyes to a fraction the worth, financially
speaking, of the goods going from and coming to his
produce store. Woe betide the clerk in his establish-
ment whose whole time is not his master’s —does he
not pay them for that ? Your self-made business man
is generally a hard, but still conscientious master.
Perhaps underneath his glossy waistcoat there lurks a
feeling of petty jealousy, for here are his paid dependants
speaking and writing grammatically whilst he, with all
his wealth, can with difflcnly sign his name to the
cheques he is so proud to pay them with. Although
rough in speech and action, he is kind in his way to the
little street arabs who almost live iu the gutters, where
he himself once played. Many a copper from his
capacious pockets finds its way into their grimy little
paws and if their is one charity that he subscribes to
more largely than others, it is that for homeless
children. Then again, there is your commercial gentle-
man, who has been liberally educated, whose youthful
days have known no struggle for bread; from whose
eyes no hitter tears have been forced whon wintry winds
have blown keen through the street arah’s scanty
clothing and the cruel frost chilled his bare feet as he
limped along. Our commercial gentleman, nursed in the
lap of luxury, knew no want that a well-lined pocket or
indulgent parents could gratify. When old enough he
prebahly steps into his father’s large house of business.
What other men struggle to obtain, he finds ready
waiting for him. His natural aptitude for business fits
him for his position. Naturally, as he grows older the
business becomes in a measure his, or if on the other
hand he has been placed while young in another “ firm,”
he has now become a partner and leading man in the
business. As fortune favors him, so he can afford to
sti'etch out a helping hand to others, for education
makes men liberal-minded to one another and many a
stranger coming f o these very shores, has, although
fitted iu every respect for business, found it almost
impossible to gain a living because he was a stranger.
To such our wealthy educated commercial men have
been good friends. They have received them kindly,
read their letters, not sent them away with empty
promises, but have recommended them to other
merchants and through their energy placed many a poor
friendless clerk in a good berth and even then, looking
them up now and again with a friendly shake of the
hand and a few hearty words kindly spoksn, shewn them
they are not forgotten. Such are our commercial men
in Australia.

MELBOURNE FOLLIES.
The “ white elephant”—our International —was
built without chimneys, without a ladder to ascend
the dome, without avenues, with very little light,
ifith wooden staircases, with wooden posts, with
the down-spouts running into the main hall, and
•jvith decorations more suitable for a second-rate
cafd than the receptacle of the world’s wondrous
works.
That popular pasquinade, “ Pinafore,” pays
profusely, and piles of pelf pour into the plethoric
purses of its promoters.
As an outcome of the “catchy-catchy” letters
in the Argus, a lecture is to be delivered at the
Athenaeum on the popular subject, “ The Decline
of Matrimony.” We think that it is the-Matter
o’ money that is on the decline. The lecture is to
be delivered by a “native” in aid of the Burns
fund. Ho has a name, but he won’t Hone it.
The “Owls” are about to tender a benefit to
J. J. Wallace. Those benevolent old fowls are
ever to the fore in acts of charity. ’Owl that do ?
“ The Dunnes, have done it.” So said Marcus
when ha allowed his wife to re-appoar after a
twelve years’ absence from the stage.
Ireland's adopted daughter—we do not moan of
Brin —will have a benefit tendered to her by the
Hawthorn Dramatic Club. We refer to Miss Kate
Vinson, the coming Australian star. “ Our Boys”
ia on the programme.
Chops and tonato sauce, German mince and
Strasburg abominations are not swallowed by
Melbourne gourmands. Therefore Miss Fidler is
a failure in the “metropolis of the Australias.”
The girls of this village know how to dance
without a Fidler.
The “agony column” of the Argus swells
daily. Psychological students here give vent to
their outraged feelings.
f. The “ Furriners ” are looking up for the Ex-
| Xb'tion period. Two hundred and twenty
Mongolian aesthetics marched through the streets
'the other day from the wharf to their salubrious
quarters in the classical neighbourhood of Little
Bourke-street. They made no remarks although
their queues gave uhe cues to obstreper’ous larri-
kins. The heathens said “we us chow-chow.
Qni s’excuse, s’accuse.
Max Kreitmayer waxes wroth -when the name of
Milner Stephen is mentioned. He always thought
this latter gentleman a model of integrity until
the celebrated railway-incident.
A Parisian style of decoration is ! being adopted
in the streets of Melbourne. On the facade of
Ezywakin a, “the people s bootmaker,” gigantic
figures are painted in the glowing colours of the
rainbow. Commerce, industry, etc., are all
represented. The jewellery and fancy-goods stores
are following in the wake. The question is how
these gorgeous colours will stand the Australian
sun.
Goo. Coppin has such a large family that when
he takes them to the Hermitage, Sorrento, the
population of that fashionable watering place is
almost as great as that of the metropolis.
The “mud dobbor” (which is Mark Twain’s
phrase for a pianists) of Melbourne rave about
Ketten. Young Alfred Moul says he prefers him
to John the Baptist, which is daring profanity for
that fair youth.
Zox always wears a white waist coat, and so did
the great Sir Robert Peel; but here the likeness
ends.
David Gaunson is on the rampage again. He
says that, next to Berry, Service is the greatest
fool and scoundrel (politically, of course) in
Victoria.
Mortimer FranMyn, of the Victorian Re-
view, is admitted to be a first-class canvasser,
but as a literary man ho is all abroad. - James
Smith has, it’s said, a deal of trouble to lick
a certain other man’s articles into shape, and pre-
fers writing the whole thing himself to the labour
of correction.
Dr. Neild, the theatrical critic of the Austra-
lasian, is quite at variance with his “ brethren
of the quill” in singling out Mr. H. H. Vincent’s
Ramirez in “ New Babylon ” for especial censure.
What ails the doctor? For Vincent is a good
actor and thorough gentleman ?il
Marcus Clarke is 33 years of age. He says he
is only 27, but Marcus was always famed for a
strong imagination.
The new number of the Melbourne Review
will contain a political article by Professor Elking-
ton, who is the first colonial professor in Mel-
bourne and a shining light in the Conservative
lamp.
A. P. Martin is rarely seen in his old haunts,
and is living in retirement. Rumour says he is
busy with a new literary enterprise.
The threatened libel action of Marcus Clarke
against David Blair is all a “ flam,” and only an
excuse for a little cheap publicity. Nothing will
eome of it.
Dick Thatcher’s friends were in great force to
eee him off, and quite outshone in number and
brilliancy those assembled to bid Trickett good
bye. Richmond is a kind of rough diamond, and
his friends are sincerely attached to him.
Bailliere is going in for a new trial. Ho is con-
fident of licking Beaney next time, with the
assistance of L. L. Smith in the witness box.
The “Now Babylon” is playing at the Royal
to a full pit and empty dress circle. Bland Holt,
J- L. Hall, St. Lawrence, Vincent, and Miss Merton
are greatly admired in it, but the “Formosa”
element keeps respectability out of the house.
Rotten is a great success artistically, .but the
Opera House is not crammed. Lyster gives the
gifted Henri .£5O a night.
The Juvenile “ Pinafore ” is about played out.
The children look horribly jaded off the stage,
and - altogether “infant phenomena” are to be
decried.
. Theo. Hamilton has closed the People’s Theatre
m his usual cool style. Bland Holt induced him—
the inducement being coin of the realm.
D’Orsay Ogden and Miss Beatrice are idle. ,Ho
has been trying to got the Opera House, but there
, is a hitch somewhere.
i Mr. R. A, Proctor gets more money into the
J Athenaeum Hall than any of the Theatres do at
Present. Society is crazy on the stars, and
reserved seats are at a premium.
Notes from Banana Land.
(From our Brisbane Coi-respondent.)
Ihe report which has been going the rounds that
charming and favourite actress was about to
throw in her lot with a Queensland “ motallician”
18 without foundation. Ho has not yet completed
a satisfactory “preparation,” and has done his
fast work ” too early. So she thinks.
~The Hon. J. P. Bell never knows whereabouts
ms horses are going to run. Kellett, who manages
ms stables, doesn’t know either.
Bancroft the jockey went “ broke ” to a friend
°r 4s. at “ grab ” the other day. A sympathising
Jstander remarked, “ What! wouldn’t he make
lt m cr °wn?” He wouldn’t.
uhe Brisbane public are getting very “ full ” of
bookmakers. They want to know who Geo is in
• , and why ho was as hard as steel in scratch-
§ Major for the Toowoomba Handicap.
The Q.T.C. are going to travel their totalisator,
and the secretary contemplates taking it with him
to Rockhampton.
There are more honest men on the Queensland
turf just now than rogues. This is most unfortu-
nate for the sport.
Silberberg has been successfully courting for-
tune at the “petre” and unsuccessfully in the
book.
John Finnie is going to retire from the turf if
he cannot win every race he tries for.
Napper Tandy has been backed to win
,£lO.OOO for the next Melbourne Cup. If he wins
it would be about what ho has cost and drinks.
Daily practice is going on at the Brisbane rifie
ranges for the forthcoming association matches.
Keen interest is taken in the selection practice by
those who are desirous of competing in the
International match.
Shepperson and Howarde are going in for “biz.”
for Dampier. They’ve engaged all the blank
walls in town for posters. Dampier opens here
on the 23th June.
Hart and Flower, solicitors, have sent an in-
junction to Shopperson and Howard, forbidding
them to produce “Pinafore.” Shepperson pro-
poses to test the question on the ground that
Williamson is an alien.
E. B. Forrest, of the firm of Parbury and Lamb,
has gone to Sydney. He has taken with him the
model of a yacht from which he is to have one
built by G. Donnelly, of Sydney, which will com-
pote in the Champion Cup, to bo sailed for on
Boxing-Day.
A yacht to compete for the Champion Cup, on
Boxing-day, is being built here by E. G. Black-
more. It will be launched in about a fortnight.
The Hamilton Reach regatta at Brisbane will be
held this year on JSeparation Day, in December,
instead of on the flth November, as heretofore.
The Turf Club have determined to have races on
the last-named day.
Major Moore's vice-regal purchase, Kooralbyn,
did not shine at the late Brisbane or Ipswich races.
The animal does not appear to have benefitted by
the change from Chinese to European grooming.
The Rev. J. G. Turner has solved the great pro-
blem of “How to make the most of both worlds.”
He travels for the A. M. P. Society and on Sun-
days preaches in the Wesleyan chapels on “ the
uncertainty of life.”
Amongst the fashionable arrivals by Cobb’s
coach last week, on Gympie, were four life assur-
ance agents, headed by the Rev. J. G. Turner.
Things somehow got mixed, and the representative
of the youngest office in the colony was left in
undisputed possession of the field.
Some wag in Brisbane suggested that June22nd
should be selected for a parade of the first com-
pany of Volunteers, so that “the eclipse” might
be blamed for the paucity of attendance of officers
and men —-more especially the former.
It is reported in Volunteer circles in Brisbane
that the command of the first company has been
offered to an officer on condition that he does not
accept it. The officer in question is a “curled
darling" at tea-fights, and his livery excites the
envy of the officers of the A. S. N. Co.’s fleet.
Incendiarism, arson, and fires in general from
“natural causes” have made it so rough in
Brisbane for the Mercantile Mutual that that
association has decamped, handing over its
business to the Queensland Insurance Company,
whose secretary (Graham Nixon) now looks more
important than ever.
A story is told of Judge , thatl have not seen
in type. He was stopping, during drought, at an
hotel near Roma. Before retiring, he ordered his
bath, but this luxury, it was explained to him, was
unobtainable, as the water had to be carted a dis-
tance of over three miles. Early the next morning
the landlord going to the rear of his hruse found
his lodger stripped and bathing in the water-cask.
He remonstrated, explaining that that was the
only water they had for culinary uses. “ Never
mind,” said the Judge, “nobody will know —I did
not use soap.”
Homes for the People.
The attention of our [readers is directed to an adver-
tisement under the above heading appearing in our
columns, which seems to us to involve direct evidence
of the rapid rise aud sound progress of this colony,
and to afford undeniable proof of the superiority
of the advantages enjoyed by the working classes
of New South Wales over those presented to
their less fortunate brethren of tho old country. The
idea of instituting a system whereby persons of slender
means could become possessors of their own freeholds
by small periodical payments, equivalent to ordinary
rental, although anticipated in some measure by many
excellent Land and Building Societies, appears to have
been perfected at Balmain, where it was introduced
some eight years since by the euteprising Mr. Alfred
Hancock. About the time we speak of the western
portion of this now important and highly prosperous
suburb, comprising some 550 acres, and known as the
Balmain Estate, was one vast waste, covered with
dense scrub ; and Mr. Hancock, with the foresight aud
energy peculiar to him, conceived the notion of initia-
ting an extensive scheme for providing “ Homes for the
people” upon a gradual and almost imperceptible inode
of payment, suited to the limited means of the indus-
trial classes, and scarcely representing in amount the
rent ordinarily paid by them to their landlords. From
so liberal a basis it is hut small matter for surprise
that satisfactory results should follow : but the most
sanguine could scarcely have anticipated the brilliant
and almost unexampled success that has so speedily
eventuated. In the short space of time alluded to the
change wrought has been marvellous. Where the
wilderness ivas but as yesterday, now exist good
streets well lighted with gas, churches, schools,
hotels, handsome shops, and continuous lines of pretty
cottages—truly “Homes for the People.” These amply
attest the hapny results produced by the action of the
promoters. Whilst the grand public works in connec-
tion with the Government bridge across Iron Cove and
Parramatta River, aud the splendid builldingat Callay
Park, all now in progress, and involving an expenditure
of £430,000, cannot fail to contribute immensely to
the grand future in store for Balmain generally, the
great good effected by the scheme will be in some mea-
sure indicated by the fact that the amount realised by
the sale of individual allotments to date exceeds
£120,000. At the latter end of 1877 it was thought de-
sirable to a< Id to the attractions offered by supplying
building material to those purchasers requiring it,
payable by weekly instalments of 10s, and we are in-
formed that this great additional advantage has been
availed of to the extent of £7OOO or £BOOO to date.
This has had tho double effect of placing the fortunate
recipients under their own roofs, and greatly accelera-
ting the general advancement of the district, enhancing
the value of the nnooeujned and unsold lots. Wo
know of no business scheme which has confei’red so
much substantial benefit upon the industrial classes
generally ;'ami as we are informed that Mr. Hancock
has still some hundreds of choice lots open for selec-
tion, we wish him that full measure of success aud
profit which his energy and enterprise undeniably
deserve.
The New Gas Invention.
There can bo no doubt that tho International
Exhibition, that was to be without any benefit
whatever, has left ns some inventions or appliances
of a sound practical character. First among
these is Needles’ Patent Gas Machine, for light-
ings, churches, factories, public buildings and
cities. We had an opportunity this week of in-
specting the apparatus in operation at the estab-
lishment of the agents, Messrs. Smith and Hamil-
ton, Globe Buildings, Sussex - street, and it
certainly gave us great surprise. The invention
is one of much practical value, and cannot but be
an industrial and commercial success wherever
introduced. It places even the smallest inland
town on an equality in respect to lighting with
any city supplied by gas in the ordinary way. It
has the advantage of being perfectly safe and
easy of management, and above all exceedingly
cheap. Then in another way the invention is of
great practical value on stations or in inland
towns, for not only does it provide a moans of
lighting, but a very cheap source of power. It is
well known that whore power to the extent of one
to five horses is required the gas engine super-
sedes the steam-engine, being infinitely cheaper,
simpler, safer and handier. VVell, with this new
appliance, power, say for a printing office, can be
got to work a gas engine, and sufficient gas gene-
rated to supply not only the office but the whole
side of the street also, leaving the owner of the
machines a grand profit on the investment.
The material used in the invention is gasoline,
and the agents for the machine are now importing
and supplying it to allow of the production of gas
at an outside cost of ss. per thousand feet. The
patent admits of the production of gas sufficient
to drive a 20-horse-power engine or light a whole
town ; and, with this new invention at com-
mand, no largo hotel inland nor municipality
should bo, without gaslight, When exhibited at
the International the judges gave it the highest
award, and now that its merits are being proved
by practical use, a very satisfactory demand has
arisen. During the past week Mr. Rouse, of
Mudgee, ordered one for his station, both for
lighting and for power. Before completing his
order he had a thorough test made in his own pre-
sance and that of a number of other gentlemen,
ind the result was most satisfactory. The sole
agents, as already stated, are Messrs Smith and
Hamilton, of the Globe Buildings, Sussex-street,
who desire us to say that they will forward pam-
phlets and give full particulars to any person re-
quiring information, or they will be glad to show
the appliance in operation at their establishment.

On Watch.
There are few positions more conducive to
thought than that of watching travelling cattle
when camped on a fine night. There is a mourn-
ful solemnity about the bush in the early hours of
the morning unknown at any other time. The
humming of the quail owl, the dismal cry of the
“ mopoke,” the melancholy wail of the curlew, the
howl of the dingoes on the neighbouring hills, all
combine to produce a tendency to deep thought
hardly to be created among the busier scenes of
life. Hero, as the lonely watchman stands by his
fire with the dark sky showi ig silvery specks of
light, and the brilliant i - ays of Hesperus over-head,
ho thinks of home, of tho many friends of former
days, of tho realities of the past, the possibilities
of the future—thinks till his mind is lost in a maze
of speculation from which ho is recalled by the
lowing of some bullock which is taken with the
fancy for a stroll. “ Wooa—back there 1” But
the brute is not to be daunted, and it is only as
horse and rider approach almost to his very nose
that the animal slouches back to camp and surlily
lies down again. Then all is quiet, and our watch-
man returns to his fire and his meditations. "When
there is but one watch in the camp it is apt, from
tho different styles of manipulation adopted by
the various watchmen, to gain time considerably
during the earlier divisions of the night. This
having occurred on one occasion gave rise to the
SONG OF THE CLOCK.
BY THE MORNING WATCHMAN.
(Written on Watch at Baker’s Downfall, Now England).
Tick, tick, tick,
That inexorable tick.
Which presses the hours so closely,
And passes the night so quick.
Tick, tick, tick.
With hands that no time can catch.
Passes the night away,
Heedless of time of day.
By the boss’s infallible watch.
Tick, tick, tick,
With time a race it will run.
What matters real time to it.
So long as his watch is done ?
Tick, tick, tick,
By it four hours are o’er,
And we’ll go to bed
Whate’er may be said,
We’ll watch to night no more.
Tick, tick, tick
Whenever will daylight show ?
Though the night has hurried away,
The morning is wearily slow.
Tick, tick, tick,
Onward its hands still drive.
But e’er night shows from Heaven,
That watch shows full seven
When really't should only be five.


Gus. Wangenheim.
Gus. Wangenheim, a name familiar in men’s
mouths as—lager beer. Who does not know his
portly frame, his gonial humour, his faultless
pencil, his deep-toned, unctuous voice, und zo und
zo, and, last of all, his shecndihj 9 Here have we
him pourtrayod in habit as he lives •. his hat, with
jaunty carelessness, poised on one side of his head,
cigar ready, and beer-pot in hand. Mr. Wan-
genheim, the subject of our artist’s sketch, has
been before the public of the colony some eight-
and-twenty years, and in numerous positions has
drawn for myriads of friends good beer and better
portraits, and in a public way has earned for him-
self a reputation as a facetious artist and witty
caricaturist second to none. Upon the walls of
his present house are placed the faces of men with
whom necessity compels us to claim acquaintance-
ship, those whoso society we seek, some whoadorn
the wall, and others who receive adornment from
their position thereupon. Artists and actors,
authors and musicians, parsons, politicians, and
prize-fighters—one happy family, where no hint
of discord has a place, and where the present and
the past seem, as it were, linked hand in hand to-
gether in the best of fellowship. There are some
400 portraits on these walls, each perfect in it-
self. and each marking an epoch in the history of
public favours or expressed dissents, and alto-
gether speaking in the praise of the observer, ar-
tist and humourist to whose skilled pencil they
owe their local habitation. Gus. Wangenheim, in
addition to being an artist of undoubted powers,
is one of the best of boon companions, and an
hour in his society has been often known to de-
molish more troubles (and lager beer, of course)
than even the apocryphal but noted “ balm of
Gilead." Gus. is a firm friend, a good fellow, a
charitable man, an estimable citizen, and the
father of MissEmma Wangenheim, one of the most
celebrated of the Australian vocalists of the day
—and—well, what more in his praise would you
have said ?
Wbo’or lias tra veil'd life’s dull round,
Where’er his stages may have been.
Must sigh to think he still has found
The warmest welcome at an inn.

Just after Sir Hercules landed, a cruel story,

it’s immaterial which —at Government House. When

Mr. Jeremiah Moore, bookseller, is, we are glad

as to the manner iu which Mr. Moore made up his big
fortune, we are very’ sorry to leai n from a correspondent
that onr remarks have been interpreted as disparaging
to Mr. Moore. The statements made were merely
intended as illustrative of the rough-and-ready method
in which dealings were conducted in Sydney on almost
all hands many’ years ago, mtd were uot calculated to
convey that Mr. Moore had been connected with busi-
ness in any way dishonourable.
A capital story is being told in Brisbane. A
“ gay Lothario,” who occupies an exalted position in
the Civil Service, was amusing himself the other even-
ing whispering soft nothings over a back garden fence
to a buxom Hebe—or Abigail, it matters uot which. The
mistress coming on to the side verandah saw and
understood the position. Gliding down the garden she
, reached the wooers’ side uuperceived, and then gently
murmured, “ Mary, I told you before that I preferred
you receiving your followers iu the kitchen.” Mr ’»
reply is not recorded, nor do we know whether he
waited to hear the conclusion of the sentence.
At the farewell dinner given the other day in
Melbourne to Richmond Thatcher Mr E. A. Proctor
made au astronomical speech. He said the distinguish-
ing characteristic of the southern heaven was its com'*
cality arising from its variety, and it was in that resp J j
different from the northern heaven where there w >
uniformity. The variety iu the southern heaven wal-jj
however, accompanied with extreme brilliancy. Thai
was the emblem of society—in this part of the world.]
He found great variety aud also great brilliancy when,
he looked ai’ound him in the room that evening. Thera
was one thing in which he found uniformity iu these
colonies—viz., the geniality aud kindness which he had
received from everybody.
It’s not generally known that a certain elegant,
much-abused and deeply-indebted, but withal good-
natured official who has just come to grief in Sydney is
the hero of a big romance—that, in fact, a novel’s been
written about him. There’s no don t concerning his
identity, for in the novel aforesaid special reference is
made to his eye glass. He is the son of a marquise and
married the daughter of his mother’s stableman In
consequence he had to “ clear ” from Euglaud, but he
didn’t bring his wife with him. His mother recently
wrote to a friend iu Sydney expressing her pleasure at
hearing that he was getting along well aud her confi-
dence that he would do something if he were looked
after. However, he wasn’t looked after, yet he has
“ done something." <
A little while ago the son of a swell in “the
tight little island” came to “ do the Continent ” —the
Australian continent, of course. He found clothes
cheaper—and more elegant—than home-made garments,
so he ordered a suit which followed him by next boat.
When the steamer arrived the young gentleman paid
the freight, went on board, and, in order to evade duty,
put on the new above the old. However, the douaniers
missed the package in the landing waiter’s returns, and
it was soon found that delivery had been taken of it.
The travelled swell was soon face to face with the im-
perious collector, but he pleaded ignorance of the re-
gulatidhs, and as he mas a swell was let off with doable
duty. He now says that foreign tailors would be right
enough but for Tasmanian customs officials.
Mr. Ratcliffe Bring, Q.C., the Attorney-General
of Queensland, has abdicated in favour of little Beor,
the member for Bowen. Pring was member for the
Valley but failed to secure his re-election when be ac-
cepted the appointment. A similar fate, the quidnuncs
say, awaits Beor. He will be opposed by John Hall
Scott (one-armed Scott). It will be most unfortunate
if Beor is beaten as the Government will hardly care
to face another session while the gentleman holding
this portfolio has not a seat iu the House. It is a ease
of “out of the frying pan into the tire,” for Beor can-
not he mentioned iu the same year as Pring as a de-
bater, while he is young iu years and his Parliamentary
experience is very limited. Nor must we forget (says
our Brisbane correspondent) that the appointment will
possibly cost more than one vote through professional
jealousy.
We have been entertaining’
an angel unawares. About
twelve months since a gentle-
man arrived in Sydney with
the debris of £l,OOO in his
pocket, and as they heard he
w's blne-hlooded, people took
kindly to him and he speedily
planted his feet under aristo-
cratic mahogany. He was soon
in urst-rate fettle for a station-
in'let at “twenty hob a week
and found,” but after eating
Job may cakes, water-dogs and
black sugar, and drinking tea
out of a billy-lid for a few
mouths he rose superior to
himself with the advent of the
International, where he aired
to some advantages his lin-
guistic gifts. It may here be
mentioned that the £l,OOO he
had on leaving England was
obtained in the following
manner. He was a younger son
and was fast in a ratio inverse
to his income. He “ made »
smash ” and applied to his elder
brother, the Earl of —-f°f
assistance, which was denied
him. A few days after a sign
hoard inscribed “ Fish and
Oyster Saloon, by the Honor-
able Mr. ” was hoisted over
a very unpretentious little shop
in the ancestral village. Hj e
board and the £l.OOO shortly

Turf Talk.
BY NEW WARRIOR.
I have little indeed to tell of this week in the
shape of races to come, closin" of stakes, etc.,
and my index shows rather a dull state of things
for the coming ten days. Last Wednesday,
Thursday, and this Friday have been occupied
with the meetings of Cobar, Northern Downs, and
Warnambool, and the results, so far as obtainable,
will bo found in another column. Next Thursday,
which will be the Ist of July, will witness the
Victorian Amateur Turf Club programme run
through, and so far as can be gleaned from a
magnificent cn r a good day’s sport s promised.
Entries for some of the good things on tire Denili-
qnin programme are called for on the coming
Wednesday, and on Thursday will close the Dis-
trict Plate, Members’ Handicap and Hurdle Eace,
to bo run for at Eockhampton a week later.
As this is an important item to Queenslanders, I
hope the fixture will not be forgotten. Then on
the sth, next Monday Week, the Clarence River
general entry closes, and here is an ather item that
must not be allowed to pass unnoticed. The pro-
gramme is by no means a bad one. and a good list
of entries ought to be enticed. The weights for
the Rockhampton Races mentioned above will be
declared on the same day as the Clarence River
entries close, to be followed by others for Denili-
quin on the 10th, the coming Saturday, and those
are all that require looking forward to. Accep-
tances are due on next Thursday for the Rock-
hampton and Port Curtis Handicaps, and that
done my list is finished for the present week.
The weights for the three principal Handicaps
in Australia were declared on Wednesday last, and
ns usual there was some grumbling done. I have
neither time nor space to review the lists in this
issue, but will promise my readers a run down
them in my next. The weights will bo found
in another column.
Isuoiny and Robert the Devil’s pedigree have,
through pressure on space, to be held over.
In my last I published what I was given to un-
derstand were the two new rules lately passed by
Tattersall’s Club, and said at the time they were
unintelligible. Since then the secretary has in-
formed me that a mistake had m - opt into the para-
graph, and I now give the rules as they were
passed : —l. “ That the committee bo empowered
to admit or reject a member as a visitor on payment
of his admission fee, namely, one guinea, for the
meeting only, and that the said member should
not have the power to vote at any special or
general meeting, nor have any interest in the
funds of the club, but he shall be entitled to all
other privileges of the club. 2. The committee
shall of themselves have power to make such by-
laws as they shall deem necessary for the manage-
ment of the club.” Even as the first rule reads
now it cannot be said to be other than unintelli-
gible, unless fully explained. From my point of
view the object sought is to charge visitors to the
colony, who shall bo elected as members, one
guinea before each meeting of the A.J.C., and
which said guinea entitles them to the use of the
room on meeting nights; and although these visi-
tors may attend both the Spring and the Autumn
Meetings of the A.J.G., and pay a guinea each
time, the amount of the annual subscription, they
shall not have power to vote, nor shall they have
any interest in the funds of the club, nor a voice
in "the management. So far so good ; but what is J
meant by rejecting a member as a visitor on
payment of his admission fee I do not pre-
tend to know. I have only surmised that “for
the meeting only” the rule applies to A.J.C.
meetings, and not others; but so far as can be
gleaned from the wording of my subject all meet-
ings might bo intended, and in fact each meeting
night of Tattersall's Club, for I’ll defy any one to
interpret the rule properly. I have previously
had occasion to differ from the ruling of some of
the members of Tattersall’s committee, and this
time with very good reason ; and unless the first
of the rules given is *’ licked into shape,” I fore-
see that all sorts of difficulties will arise from it.
The second rule empowers the committee to make
such by-laws as they may think fit, instead of as
heretofore having them adoptedby a general meet-
ing. I don’t think this a good rule, for since the
above rules were passed I have hoard dissatisfac-
tion expressed at the manner in which new
rules are proposed and brought up for adoption.
The members I have been speaking to think that
when notice is given of an alteration all those
members who are within easy distance of town
should have copies sent to them, and their opinion
could then bo given. As things are now it is out
of the question for the opinion of members to be
properly registered ; sometimes the proposed rules
or alterations are published and sometimes not.
I quite agree that something should be done in
this matter, and that quickly. A committee of
course is an absolute necessity, but I do not be-
lieve in too much power being given to such a
body. Without wishii g to impute false motives
to Tattersall’s committee, I say that packed
meetings have been heard of before now, and in
snch a body as the one under notice things should
be managed properly and copies of notices of
motion I maintain should be served on all members
of the club.
The winning post at Randwick has been moved
from its old position, and now stands between 30
and 40 yards nearer the road. Of course all
the other posts on the course have been shifted in
proportion. I don’t know why this altei’ation has
been brought about, but the occupants of the
grand stand and paddock will have the pleasure of
witnessing more of the final struggle for a raco
than they have been in the habit of seeing. Now
that these alterations have been made, could not
the A.J.C. try to curry favour with their great
supporters the public and remove the ob-
jectionable drafting rail.
Mr. Robbins, of Maryborough, has been dis-
qualified by the Maryborough and Carisbrook
Racing Club for ever, the reason for such a pro-
ceeding being that he used insulting language to
Mr. Yowles, the M. and C. handicapper.
For the V.A.T.C. meeting on Thursday next
there are 27 in the hurdle race, 26 in the amateur
flat race, 10 in the maiden steeplechase, 23 in the
flat race, 10 in the gold cup, and 14 in the selling
race.
Mr. John Thompson, the well-known Victorian
metallician, intends following Trickett to England,
says the Australasian, for the purpose of as-
sisting in training the champion. In selecting a
genuine good fellow, and a painstaking one to
boot, Trickett could not have been happier in his
choice.
I heard a discussion a few days ago relative to
the: 21b. allowance being given to horses who
had declared over weight. There were several
arguments brought forward on both sides of the
question, but without going further into the mat-
ter I may say that the declaration of over-weight
does not interfere with the 21b. allowance, though
the horse may have gone out a atone over his han-
dicap weight.

Hand.
The victory of Petronel in the Two Thousand

Robbie Burns has gone into Mr. E. Howie’s

English jockey clubs have decided that all
jockeys fees are to be paid to the stakeholders at
the same time as the stakes. This is owing to
several owners of horses being largely in-
debted to jockeys, and the club at last stepped in
to watch and guard the jockeys’ interests. The
fees in England are 3 guineas for a losing mount
and 5 for a winning one.

A story has obtained currency in Brisbane to the
effect that Hanlan was willing to come to Sydney in
November, but that Trickett preferred to row on the
Thames, as he desired to go home aud settle perma-
nently. In consequence of this, the amount obtained
in aid of the fund to send the champion home was
trifling. We hear on good authority that £2OO or more
coaid easily lie obtained in Brisbane to induce Hanlan
to visit Australia.
A grand boxing tournament is to bo got up in a
few days for bath light and heavy weights. The con-

under 10 stone, and one for men above that weight—
those who enter for the former being eligible for the
latter. Two prizes of £5 each will be given, and entries
may be made any evening up to the coming Tuesday at

The boxing will be under the Marquis of Queensberry’s

Willie Hawkins, the jockey who met with an
accident while rxdingthe racehorse Swindler at the la-t
Grand National meeting (N.Z ) has died at the Christ-
church Hospital. He had gradually got worse from
the injuries he. received by the fall. He had many
fri nds in New Zealand, aud was one of the best jockeys
that ever mounted a horse. The horse Swindler died
on entering his box on the night of the race from the
injuries x-eceived. Keith, another jockey, was also
hint at the same meeting.
A ’Frisco paper publishes the latest on the
walking mania. Here it is:—“ It is bud enough to
have athletes compete in long-distance walking matches.
It is too bud to induce cripples to do so. Yet, on the
Hth of May. there begins in Patterson, N.J., a thirty-
six-hour walking match, in which all the competitors
must be one-legged, and walk on a peg or an artificial
leg. The first prize will be an artificial leg worth 100
d"ls., and thirty per cent, ot the gate money. There
should be a society formed over there for the preven-
tion of cruelty to one-legged men.
Mata is said to be the fastest horse in N. Z. and
has been nomingted for oar great Metropolitan Stakes
Handicap and Melbourne Cup. Should this speedy son
of Dead Shot and Banjo get in at a fair weight, it is the
owner’s intention to give Australians a taste of this
horse's capabilities. He has won among many other
big events the Danedin Cup two consecutive years
(1879-80), and the time for the latter year was the
faatest ever made for this race, 3 min. 59) sec., two
miles and a distance, carrying Bst 91b. His time in
1879 was 3 min. 571 sec , when he carried 7st 81b. Mata
belongs to a yery speculative stable, and, it is said
owned by H. Prince, E. Cutts, and the Hon. G.
Campbell. The Australian gelding Camballo has also
been nominated for the above-named big events. The
only winning bracket to his name in Now Zealand was

ENGLISH SPORTING.
Our files of the last mail contain much interest-
ing mail news, bringing as they do particulars of
several important races that are annually run in,
April and early in May ; and as it is often of no
small service to racing men to have at their hand
a record of past events, we pick out the principal
races alluded to, with such data as we can afford
space for. These comprise four early Spring han-
dicaps, namely, the Northamptonshire Stakes,
the Newmarket Handicap, the Metropolitan
Stakes, and the City and Suburban, as well as the
Two Thousand and One Thousand Guinea Stakes,,
run at the Newmarket First Spring Meeting ; and
our readers will find not ordy full pedigi eos of the;
City and Suburban winner, the Two Thousand
winner, and the One Thousand winner, but also
tables showing the placed hores in these and the
Metropolitan Stakes for years past, which they
will do well to preserve for easy reference.
Foremost in importance among the surround-
ings and results of the Great Spring Three-year-
old Races may, I think, be taken the running of.
the two-year-old sons of Doncaster, for the pre-
viously untried Muncaster ran a great second fer-
tile Two Thousand, being only beaten a head by
Fetronel; and since then we have learnt by cable-
gram that the unconquered Rend Or made an easy
conquest of his field for the Blue Riband. His
Grace of Westminster has reason to congratulate
himself on his purchase of Doncaster, notwith-
standing that the price was ,£14,000 guineas ; and
I can quite believe he has cast back more than
one thought to the fact that his grandfather re-
fused 10,000 guineas for that wonderful family,
founder Touchstone. Petronel, winner of the
Two Thousand, is by Musket, who was last year
imported to New Zealand at a great price ; and it
it is worthy of remark that although the public
spotted the winners of the Metropolitan Stakes
and the City and Suburban, as well almost
getting straight on Elizabeth for the One Thou-
sand, they seemed to leave Petronel out in the
cold entirely. The sporting scribes of Belt.
and Spokting Life wouldn’t have him at all,
and he left the paddock with twenty to one going:
begging about him. The news of this victory
will have been received with joy by the great,
Auckland stud in wdiich Musket disports himself;
and evidently whoever made the purchase know*
his way about. The One Thousand winner,
strangely enough, is also nearly connected with
two animals that came to these colonies j
for she is by Talisman, whose sire, Young Mel-
bourne, is also the sire of Mr. John Lee’s Antonia,
the dam of Remembrance and Elizabeth a dame.
Fair Rosamond is by Xing John, who was the
sire of Mr. Rouse's imported horse Brigadier.
The pedigree of this filly is not by any means a
fashionable one ; for which reason, as 1 suppose,
she was not entered for classical runs, and her
name didn't grace the list of either Oaks or Legor,
which was a pity. The Two Thousand field was a
good one, which has only been exceeded three
times —namely, 1805, ’07 and ’69, the winners
being Gladiator, Yauban and Pretender. But this
year, from the fact of the four finishing so close
together, the idea was that the field was only
mediocre, which I imagine the Derby running to
have shown decisively. I read that the One
Thousand fillies were a better looking lot than the
Two Thousa; d colts.
Chippendale and Master Kildare, the Metro-
politan and City and Suburban winners, are a pair
of grandly bred ones ; and the former is nearly
allied to Gemma di Vcrgy, who is by English
Gemma, grandsiro of Chippendale- This last is
bg Rococo (son of Gemma di Vergy and Rowena)
from Adversity by Advertiser (son of Nowminster)
from Stockhaven by Stock well from Citron; and
so the Metrop. winner is as full as a horse can bo
of Sir Hercules, Irish Birdcatcher, Sweetmeat,
Glencoe, Touchstone, Whalebone, The Baron all
grand founders. Master Kildare is, I might
say, almost full brother in blood to Chippendale,
for ho (Kildare) is by Lord Ronald (son of Stock-
well and a Newminster mare) from Silk (grand-
daughter of Sweetmeat and the Birdcatcher mare
Foinnuallas) ; so wo have hero precisely the same
strains, all in combination, and in about the same
proportions. Wo intend giving onr readers on
the arrival of each mail the full pedigrees of the
principal winners as well as titles of the placed
horses in the great races of the season for the last
fifteen or twenty years.
The hunting and coursing seasons having both
concluded at the date of onr last files, and the
Australian cricketers not having begun play, the
turf furnishes our only pabulum ; and we give the
following as the most interesting items : —

This was a great race, in the early part of which
grrat changes occurred in the places of the field,
as the pane told its invariable tale on one after
another of the second and third raters, and the
finish is thus described in the Sporting Life :
Before reaching the road Henry George boat a
retreat, and Maid of Orleans for a short distance
had the advantage oi Clareneienx, hut she was
soon beaten, and, with Gil Bias also dropping out,
the issue was soon narrowed to Clareneienx. Leo-
ville,_ and Master Kildare. Below the distance
Leoville assumed the command, with the other pair
handy, and opposite the stand. Master Kildare
settled Clareneienx, and challenged for the lead ;
Leoville. however, struggled hard, and Archer
setting down to ride in earnest, a splendid race
ensued, Master Kildare getting np in tho last
stride or two and winning by a head ; Clareneienx
finished a bad third, clear of Visconti, who was
running on, fourth. Caxtonian was fifth, Parolle
sixth, Lueetta seventh. Maid of Orleans eighth,
Vegetarian ninth, Toastmaster tdnth, Kineton
eleventh, the last two being Sly Dance and Rosy
Cross, who broke down, while Simba and Scape-
grace did not pass the post. Time, by Benson’s

Master Kildare, a chesnnt horse by Lord Ronald
out of Silk, was bred by Mr. P. Kenny in Ireland.
For that gentleman he won the Stapolin Plate
Handicap at the Baldoyle Meeting in September,
1877, and in tho following April a Queen's Plato
at the Cnrragh. He ran third in the same year
for the Doncaster St. Leger, in Lord Lonsdale’s
name, and occupied a similar position in tho
Liverpool Autumn Cap as Captain Machell’s
property. Since then he has run as Lord Hast-
ings’. and for him carried off tho Kempton Park
Cup last July, tho Egham Cup. Doncaster Alex-
ander Plate, Kempton Park October Handicap.
Liverpool Autumn Cup, and Severn Cup at
Shrewsbury. This year ho has won the City and

Tho race was a fast one from the start, and a
large proportion of the field wore easily beaten,
so that there were but four “in it” after going
throe quarters of a mile. We read of these four
that as tho ascent for home was commenced,
Beauminet, going well, was a length to the good
of Petronel, who held a alight advantage of Man-
caster and The Abbot, on the Stand side, tho
quartette running very wide of each other. Half-
way np the hill Beauminet began to come back,
and the other three gradually overhauling him, a
splendid finish in the last fifty yards resulted in
Petronel gaining tho verdict by ahead from Mnn-
caster, while The Abbot, three parts of a length
off, just hosted Beauminet for place money. Then
came Mask fifth, at a clear interval. Zealot sixth,
with Count de Lagrange’s pair next, in front of
Fernandez and Clareucieux with Brotherhood the
absolute last. Time, by Benson’s chronograph,

Petronel, a black or very brown colt, by Musket
of Crytheia, by Hesperus, and whose pedigree
will be found fully tabulated above, was bred by
hia owner, the Duke of Bedford. Asa two year
old he ran twice, namely, in the Middle Park
Plato, when he was unplaced to Beandeset, Grace
Cup, and Dora, and for the Troy Stakes, at the
Newmarket Houghton Meeting, which he won
from Strathardle, Emmanuella, and the filly by
St. Albans out of Gentle Mary. His first appear-
ance this year was for the Two Thousand, which
he won as above mentioned. His engagements
comprise the Payne Stakes (101 b ex) at the New-
market Second October Meeting, and the Prince
of Wales’s Stakes (51b ex), Twenty - Second
Benuial, and Seventeenth Now Biennial (121 b ex)
at Ascot.

Elizabeth, a brown filly by Statesman out of
Pair Rosamond, by King John, and whoso pedi-
gree will be found fully tabulated above, was bred
by her owner, Mr. T. E. Walker, at Stanton’s
Paddocks, Kingsclerc. She ran twice cast year,
being successful for tho Warren Nursery Plate at
the Sandown Park Club Second Summer Meeting,
and carrying oft the Home-bred Sweepstakes at
the Newmarket Houghton Meeting. This washer
first appearance in public as a three year old.
Since 1864 the first three horses in the One
Thousand have been as follows :
Horses marked * won the Two Thousand, (f) the

We learn from Brisbane (and they ought to know
there) that George Harrell is writing a new play on tho
life and adventures of Captain Cook. It is founded ou
a picture which ho saw iu Gordon and Gotch’s window-
in Brisbane. By the way, says our Brisbane corres-
pondent, he bought a copy of Geoffrey Hamlyu as he
was leaving by the steamer. Who knows but that his
versatile pen may be able f o work the tracking of tho
lost chil ft into the adventures of Captain Cook I
Tho Victorian Exchange and Drawing-
Room Journal (which paper, by the way, is chiefly
composed of unacknowledged clippings from The Bul-
letin) expresses surprise at the fact that to “ Trickett
aud his boon companions, Mr. Jem Mace, the pugilist,
aud Mr. Jack Thompson, boon maker, should have been
allotted tho Governor’s box at tho Theatre Koyal, Mel-
bourne.” Now we don’t say anything at out the com-
pauy which our big boy Edward kept, or perhaps had
forced upon him, during his recent brief stay in tha
southern metropolis, but we’re glad (a notice that, Mr.
George Coppiu is so thoroughly impressed with a duo
sense of the maje ty of athleticism. We have nodoubt
that George duly considered before allotting tho Vice-
regal box to the three good men aud true, for he must
have known that once there they could hardly bo
put out.
Oar Brisbans correspondent writes as follows ;
—Au amusing ‘ stick ’ occurred during the perform-
ance of ’ Our Boys' ou the last night, Madame Legraud
appeared here. Mademoiselle w.ts the Mary and Alisa
Marsh the Violet, aud after the former had informed
the boys iu the third act that thenceforth the girls md
they were strangers, tho-e acquainted with the comedy
were surprised to observe th.it notwithstanding this
declaration neither of tho ladies maniiested tho
slightest iuteatiou of leaving. There being every ap-
pearance of matters remaining in statu quo lor au iu-
de.inite period. Mademoiselle evidently considered it
at cheap to sit as stand, and accordingly crossed over
to a chair and awaited the denouement. Upon this Miss
Marsh moved towards tho door, aud despite Belinda’s
(Miss Annie Marsh) emphatic injunction of ‘don’t you
go off,’repeated the lino ‘ Ves, utter strangers,” and
departed, leaving the star to follow. Gall as it must
have been to the fair Lilße, it was evident the Gaul was
not to he baulked of her way though she was sur-
rounded by Marshes. Our correspondent adds that
never was Mary so heartily ‘ sho ed’ out by Belinda as
ou this occasion, aud that Violet’s face iu the remain-
ing scenes was, like the ghost iu Hamlet, very pale,
though not a countenance more iu sorrow than iu
anger.”
In our last wo bad an article entitled, “ How
they found a capitalist.” That article was from tha
pen of a friend of George Harrell’s, and made out that
the capitalist was a very foolish young man. However,
one of George’s enemies now writes us to the effect
that Healey, tho capitalist in question, was a vary
clever young fellow, who declared he had £lO,OOO
waich bow; s n:uus that Harrell th ad invest
ia taking au Australian company home, to play
Australian plays at an Australian Theatre iu
London. Harrell believed him, and was induced to
remain a week iu Brisbane after the termination of hia
engagement, the young man undertaking to pay all hia
xs. Harrell did the block with that young man,
liquored him up, and introduced him to the ladies of
the theatre. On the fifth day that young man disap-
peared, aud handsome George had to leave without
mooting him. The Bunch boys now ask unsus-
picious loungers “ who’s Healey ?” But the laugh
does not came in yet. Sam Howard was playing low
ou Harrell, aud had arranged with “the young man”
to build him a Coffee Balace aud throw George o\er.
Sam laughs heartily when you tell this joke as against
Dan-ell. It's true that there’s not much difference be-
tween tho two stories, but there is a little between
the respective ways in which thov are told.
The oth r night, at tho Oxford Hotel, Mrs.
William Horace Luigard was awakened from balmy
repose by a mysterious something which prompted her
to suggest to her marital lord that “ somebody was
under the bed.” Not relishing the joke, tho intrepid
comedian replied, “Oh, gammon! ” turned his face to
the wall, aud recourted oblivion. Not so the lady.
With a terrible prescience of coming evil, she counted
the tedious minutes, straining eyes aud ears with bated
breath in an agony of suspense. "Again! Listen!
There —there —Horace, up, up and do ! Arm ! arm f
and out! See yonder the door! A man—a man!” "Ha!
ha! ha! ha! Ira!” Now all’s confusion. Through tha
chameer door escapes the baffled midnight marauder—
whilst husband aud wife, draped iu the snowy robes of
night, arouse the drowsy inmates. Then there was
hurrying to and fro, and cheeks that erst had worn a
ruddy glow uow blanched with dread. Burglary was
rife—spoliation was in the midst. From room to room
alarm contagious sped, and from their several chambers
issued in motley men aud women of many kinds. Then
came the search, aud soon tho thirst for gore was
manifest. Armed with property pistols and 12s. 6d.
shooters, Hamlet swords and Macbeth daggers, tho
gallant band explored. Under beds, in cupt cards,
behind boxes, up chimneys—anywhere, even where—
did the avengers seek, but found they nought. Still
the search went, ou ; each nook aud cranny, euchcrevice
aud each crack was prodded, probed, and pricked;
threats, oaths, and demonstrations, loud and long,
were levelled at the absent head of the sought-for
burglar, who, amidst the din, quietly undid the chain,
drew the bolt, aud walked serenely from the front door
into the street. The morning broke, and found the
bloodthirsty vigilauts haggard and drouthy. Tho
latter evil was remedied ; aud then Liugard, unshaven
aud unkempt, sallied forth, and recklessly squandered
money iu the purchase of a second-hand Colt for future
emergencies. Harrell, toying with a tumbler, sar-
donically recor ’ed his belief that it was a “ put-up job
for an ad.,” and Kowell, with lit tl® linger poised aloft,
vowed it should spur him on to greater watchfulness in
the days aud nights to come. But, though we tell tho
story stagily, it’s quite true.

A New Art Society.
As enthusiastic and well-attended meeting of
artists took place on Tuesday evening at the
Coffee Palace. It was decided to form an Art
Society, and a committee was appointed to draw
up suitable rules and regulations, which will bo
put to the vote at the next general meeting on
July 6th, at 8 p.m. Heretofore artists in Sydney
have usually had to exhibit their pictures in
music-shop windows but the new society will most
licely obtain a suitable gallery from the Govern-
ment for the benefit of our local artists, who have
not had a show yet. A sarcastic man submits
the accompanying sketch as illustrating what
the now society, formed on the night of the eclipse,
will probably do.

The rogues are being cleared out of Paddington

“The Bulletin”—“ tho boss paper,” they

tea and sugar ?
‘‘ Prawns ’’ is on the war-track again. Look out,

Mr. G. it. Dibbs amuses

you know, as a reminder of
old times.
Mr. Shepherd, of the Bank

The seeker for the best

A Sydney lady wishes to
dispose of a set of artificial
teeth, second hand, or rather,
second month. This seems
lair enough, unless teeth, like
other iu-mates of the month,
such as wine, cheese, and
cigars, improve by keeping.
Mr. Inglis (“ Maori”), iu
writing about the Sydney press
in his recently-published book,
“Our Australian Cousins,”
didn’t make any reference
whatever even to the existence
of The Evening Snorted.
However, The Snorter has
had sweet revenge. The other
Sydney newspapers favourably
reviewed “ Our Australian
Cousins,” but The Snorter,
whose editor knows a thing or
two, waited till the mail came
m, andrepublished the wither-
mg criticism of the Saturday
Be viler for the edification of
an admiring public.
They havn’t a hall in Aslifield big enough to

The council clerk of a certain suburban munici-

The only way Jones can account for Gately’s

have all dropped off.
Advice for mamas. A good place to get out a

The initials of the theatrical entertainments on

night it was all E.O.T.
Jules Joubert is the manager of tho Melbourne
International Exhibition for this colony. The right

A Sydney dancing master says (and so do some
avowed clerical enemies of Terpsichore) “Needs must

It is impossible to serve God and Mammon;

Positively for this night only! Owing to a prior

A new privilege —A cab on business pays toll

A minister of religion on being asked by a Mel-
bourne cabman to pay his legal fare, naively advised
him to wait till after the chnrch collection on the fol-

Some Melbourne medicine men are now adver-
tising a preparation called “ Anti-Thin,” and Professor
Pepper has certified that it’s a good thing. “To what
base uses,” &c.
The fact that no less than three members of the
staff of a certain Sydney paper have within the last 12
months fonnd it necessary to file their schedules tells
its own story.
A word to Tyerman. There’s a white spirit
which haunts the corner of Barrack and York streets.
The Colonial Treasurer has seen it, and he’s “ one of

Old, but good.—A Hebrew, who was very reli-

The thunder began to roll in sonorous peals. Onr

The officers of the Permanent Force since their
memorable amateur (?) performance at Victoria Bar-
racks, at which some of the London Comedy Company
were guests (?), are to be seen frequently at the Theatre
Eoyal. This by way of compromise.
When the “Juvenile Pinafore” performers
(who as previously stated by us are chiefly Hebrew
children) struck for increased salaries in Melbourne
the other week, some people said that even little Jews
and Jewesses were very fond of money.
A marriage is shortly to come off in which a
well-known belle is to take the “ role” of bride. The
bridegroom-elect partakes of the joint characteristics
of Neptune and Mars, and is certainly the most
soldier-like officer of our naval squadron.
The only paper in the immediate vicinity of
Sydney that goes the “ whole hog” for Protection, and
advertises that Freetraders will find in its columns
very hard nuts to crack, pays its compositors one-sixth
less than any other journal near Sydney.
Some very proper Albury residents say that a
certain local alderman is a night prowler and an alto-
gether objectionable person. They forget how many
tires have been stifled at their conception mainly
through the alarm having been sounded by a citizen
given to midnight peregrinations.
How uncouth some of these country journalists
are ! The Monaro Mercury in its last alludes to the
“ Kitten pianoforte fracas.”
No one is allowed to sell tobacco, tea, coffee, or
sugar, in England, without a license. Here are a few
facts thrown at you, Mr. Watson.
The late Mr. Henry Farley was known to every
business man in the colonies, but his address could not
be found by the police.
The Government give Katoomba Falls to Mr.
Neale, and grant £l5O to make a road thereto fox- that
gentleman. We like t» see liberality.
You can always toll when a schoolmaster writes

Darlinghurst lodgers on Sunday afternoons sing

A fellow who subscribes himself “Gimlet” is a
constant contributor of poetry to the Cooktown
Herald. Naturally enough, he is a great bore.
Publicans have to light up the streets, and pay

tribute in any way to the revenue or public comfort.
They got Hanley Bennett to look at the total
eclipse with the smoky side of the glass to his eye, and
he wanted to know “ wot the ijots were a larfin’ at ? ”
J. L. Hordern is going to shave his whiskers off,
and wear a moustache. He remarks that he looks too
much like Mr. Shepherd, and his customers say
All tae rich old gentlemen who have “ shuffled
off,” etc., during the last few weeks, have instructed
their executors to properly invest the coin. Pour to

are as yet no takers.
Wo learn that the Bishop of Sydney has refused
to license a young clergyman, a member of the Church
of England Union, as one of the objects of that Union
is protection against ecclesiastical tyranny. What will
his wife say to this ?
For once Mr. John Hurley, M.P., is right. He
wants to know why Dr. McGibbon, who is a civil ser-
vant with a salary of £l5O a year, is allowed to abuse his
masters, i.e., Members oQPaiiiament, in his inflamma-
tory handbill? Why ?
At Cairns, which is too poor and too ungodly
to support a parson, the police magistrate holds forth
every Sabbath in the vain hope that the community
may be weaned from the profane amusement of shoot-
ing alligators on Sunday.
The Pacific Weekly professes to bo a high-
toned paper, ye l. the issue of sth June contained an
article on “ Shiftless Wives.” It is reported that the
next number will have an essay on “ Shirtless Hus-
bands,” by the same author.
Poets who, while writing to The Bulletin,
are under the delusion that they are writing for it, are
hereby informed that the editor is carefully keeping all
rejected verse, and hopes to he able ere long to publish
interesting selections from same.
Some aristocratically-connected young men of
Balmain hold high festivalevery Saturday night. First
they play billiards, then they play the piano, then they
leave the “ pub.," and upset things on their way home.
However, they always go to church.
It’s said on good authority that Lord Augustus
was offered the Governorship of Victoria, but replied
that he wanted to go to Sydney, as in N.S.W. chicken
incubators wore duty free.
A cynical, observant man who attends St.
Mark’s, wants to know how it is that those of the con-
gregation who spend most in social entertainments
give least to the offertory.
A more dastardly action was never perpetrated
than that of the Inverell residents who, while Judge
Meymott’s case was sub judice, held a public meeting
condemnatory of his Honor.
Milner Stephen boasts of having in his possession
a vest that was originally made for the late Prince
Consort, which he bought while in London. Perhaps
this may invest him with miraculous powers.
The secret papers in possession of the “ Vaga-
bond,” who wrote “ The Nihilists,” are not to be
published. He has lots of their secret papers, which
would set the world ablaze if brought to light!
It is rumoured that the Government are con-
sidering a “pro rata" reduction of salaries of civil
servants to the extent of 5,7 t, and 10 per cent. It is
to be hoped that they will in connection with this
change appoint an extra official assignee.
Writes an aggrieved parent to the head teacher
of an Auckland (N.Z.) school, in answer to a note in-
quiring the cause of a pupil’s absence: —“Please the
risen i have kepe him at home he was lerning nothing
and am lerning him my selfe i remain yonrs .”
A Newtown clergyman, by name Mao , the
other Sunday gave out as his text, “ She hath done
what she could,” and went on to apologise for his want
of preparedness by stating that his good wife had
presented him with two twins (sic.) the day before. How
neat!
A Sydney profr ssor of rhetoric advertises that
he will teach French with grammatical fluency in three
months. At the foot of his ad. runs this lino, “ Mon-
sieur enseigno aussi les dtrangers parlez Anglais,”
Not so bad for a professor! Or is it the printer's
devil ?
How fond the Scotts are of using full surnames
as Christian names :— Montague Scott. Newman Scott,
Lewis Scott, Lyell ‘Scott, and the medicine man, A ins-
ley Scott—not one content with initials! However,
we rather like the fashion and admire the taste of the
godfathers.
The P. and O. mail-steamer was detained at
Melbourne two hours on Friday week, for onr English
mails, which had to go overland owing to the Wotonga
having broken down. Why is its departure not fixed
for two hours later? Sydney people could then always
post for England twenty-four hours later than at pre-
sent.
The Queensland Colonial Secretary told a depu-
tation the other day that alocal institution had offered
to take up the balance of the loan and advance the
Government “ that other million.” Can it bo possible,
asks our Brisbane correspondent, that the National
Bank is willing to lend us back one of our own two
millions!
Lord Augustus Loftus was awfully taken with
the idea of sending Trickett to England. When asked
to subscribe he set about drawing out a cheque for £4O,
but drew one by accident for 40s. They wanted to
rectify it, but His Excellency said it didn’t so very
much matter after all. However, Trickett has gone
home now.
Mr. G. E. Dihbs is perfecting a new game, to bo
called ‘‘The Sheepfold ” There are over throe thousand
yellow pieces, and the Shepherd has to capture the sheep
without taking one of the yellow boys. The sequel
game is to let the sheep take all the yellow hoys and
not be captured by the shepherd. The latter will soon
be published.
’Tis wondrous strauge (says a Victorian journal)
and not highly complimentary to those who are Eng-
lishmen, and more particularly those who are Vic-
torian-horn Englishmen, that a gross insult offered to
our Queen was resented within the House of Parlia-
ment by a Hebrew gentleman, and, outside of it, by a
South Australian colonist.
Under the heading “ Australia and New Zea-
land,” the Illustrated London News gives the fol-
lowing : —“ Lord Augustus Loftus has started for Eng-
land. The President of the Council will net during
His Excellency’s absence.” This extraordinary piece
of news is dated May Ist. It’s so relieving for a fellow
to know that it’s not true.
Ho was an ox-Lands Office clerk, tall and thin.
Only a few short mouths ago he was invested with the
“ancient and honorable order of the sack,’ 1 and as ho
smiled and twirled his dark moustache iu the most ap-
proved manner, he seemed for the moment to forget the
indignities heaped on him by an ungrateful Govern-
ment. Sic transit gloria mnndi.
“Do you know Thomas Walsh?” asked Mr.
Simpson of James Murray (Hardy Bros.) during cross-
examination. “ I know several Thomas Walshes,”
was the reply. “Do you know William Pox,” then
enquired the counsel. “I know several Foxes,” replied
Mr. Murray. “And so do I.” rejoined Mr. Simpson.
[And so do wo.—Ed. Bulletin.]
An altercation took place some nights agofbe-
tween a Waverley ’lms-boy and a Frenchman iu Oxford-
street. The foreigner could not be made to see the
force of paying extra fare after 10 o’clock, and as be did
not understand English the threats and abuse of the
’bus-boy were alike vain. After exhausting his choice
vocabulary a (bought struck the “ native,” and poking
bis head inside the ’bus. he asked “ if any lady or gen-
tlemen would oblige him with the Preach for d
fool There was no response.
At a town not far distant from Sydney a resident
bet another (noted for his powers of secretion) a large
sum of money that he could not empty a quart bottle
of “Bulldog Beer” at onedranght. He asked for half an
hour to think the matter over, which was granted.
When he returned he took the heor, drank it off, and
claimed the money. He was asked why it took him so
long to accept the bet. “Well,” he said, “I was not
quite sure that I could do it, old man; so I went home
first and tried the experiment.”
The crier of a certain court,
while teasting his toes at a sub-
stantial fire the other day during
the hearing of a case, went to
sleep. Mr. Want was address-
ing the Court, and when he sud-
denly stopped, the crier, whose
sense of the necessity of doing
something for his official screw
did not desert him even iu his
dreams, yelled out “Silence in
the Coort." Ho awoke at the
sound of his own voice and
looked round the Court iu sleepy
amazement. His Honor regar-
ded the official witheringly, and
grimly ordered him to “ takeout
the man who had made that
disturbance.”
In spite of all efforts at
concealment it has at last leaked
out that during the absence on
shore of the first officer to at-
tend a tea meeting at Williams-
town the turret of the Victor-
ian man-of-war Cerberus was
broken into and one of the
large guns abstracted. Beyond
a bunch of skeleton keys and
a copy of the lecture, “Doctors
differ,” by Dr. Beaney, nothing
was found to afford a clue to
the mystery. The sequel, how-
ever, is the strangest part. The
missing piece of ordnance was
subsequently fonnd in Mr. Bail-
liere’s summer-house at St.
Kilda, loaded to the muzzle,
pointed in the direction of
Collins-street East, and sighted
to the exact distance between
the house and Dr. Beaney s back
yard. The opportune discovery
has probably averted a dreadful
calamity. It is painful to think
of the rancorous feelings left
by the late action of Bailliere
v. Beaney, as evidenced by the
foregoing discovery. The mat-
ter will probably find its way
into the law courts before long.
The evidence taken by the Fisheries’ Commission
contains the statement by Mr. Seymour that only the
best and largest of fish are bought by Mr. Hughes,
manager of the Coffee Palace. This is pretty nearly as
neat as the statement printed in a recently published
book, to the effect that one of the finest buildings in
Sydney was the property of —— , whom everyone
knows is the author’s father-in-law.
A Melbourne paper is getting euphuistic in its
choice of language. It never speaks of a man as drunk,
but says, “ A gentlemanly fellow was found the other
day iu the streets suffering from an over-dose of alco-
hol.” Drunkenness is becoming so fashionable that
it’s not safe to say anything which may hurt the feel-
ings of a distinguished inconnu who in the cage at the
Police Court looks like a De Yere and calls himself
Brown.
On Saturday last, on Moore Park, Smith was
startled at seeing a friend, one Jones, running towards
him at a rate incommensurate with all dignity, while a
string ol variously assorted humanity followed hard at
his heels, x rom the streaming hair, glaring eyeballs,
and flushed face of the leader. Smith judged him to be
suddenly demented. But on reaching his friend the
flying Jones stopped and the crowd gathered in. Smith
and the crowd were alike anxions to know what was the
matter. Jones said he Lad run “for fun;” the fickle

Astronomical Fact. Tuesday a well-known
■Porting authority was gazing at the moon through his
equally well-known glasses, when Jones observed—
Well. ‘ Nemo,* old fellow, you don’t see any race-
horses doing trials npthere?” “Oh yes, I do," qnoth
rtur long friend; “ I see ‘ Eclipse.’ Jones is expected
to recover.
McGlone’s clothier’s shop at Brisbane was
burned down the other night. Meston. of the Obser-
Ykr. headed a salvage party and rescued a quantity of
the stock, for which, by the way he was roundly abused
by ungrateful and indignant correspondents to the
Wipers. The next day “ Bobby ” Byrne, of Queensland
Punch. was swelling round in a hand-me-down suit of
black cloth. Our correspondent says he looks quite
respectable, and refuses to drink with Pressmen before
sundown.
Across the border a young' man who had been
**Hovelling” sent a package of powder and shot one
day to a neighbour he liked not, as significant of the
recipient’s doom. The recipient shotted his gun with
it, and that night discharged it at a figure he saw
prowling round his apple trees. The young novel-
reader has had his chair cushioned.
Molvillo claimed election because his grandfather
ha*! medals. Another man had a presentation because
his mother was a very good woman. Wilson claimed
to connect perjury with mpunity because Wilson’s
Promontory was named after his grandfather. Anv
more ancestral claims? What did Hanley’s or Danvid’s
father do? We're hard up for a reason to give each a
modal.
If a fellow prosecutes a man for burglary now
the chances are that the Evening News will turn the
prosecutor into a condemned criminal, and appoint the
date of execution. The latest freak of the News is to
state that Mr. Justice Faucett presided at r meeting
of the Protestant Political Association ! Yet some
people wonder at Archbishop Vaughan’s tirade against
Evening News reporters.

ADRIENNE:
A LOVE STORT OF
The Lancashire Cotton Distress.
BOOK I.—PRIDE AND PLENTY.
CHAPTER X.— Continued.
“Yes,” said Myles, quickly, folding his arms
and leaning against the mantlopiece, his eyes fixed
upon her, as she stood before him, with her head a
little thrown back; her eyes alight, looking beau-
tiful in her energy and excitement.
“ I wish,” she said, “I often wish that I were
a working-woman, like your sister. I would show
you what I meant ; how toil could be ennobled.”
She piusad. Myles’s heart was beating wildly.
Something, whether God or devil he had no time
to think, harried quick words from his lips ; in a
roioe as low as vehement as her own had been
be said.
“ Do you And suppose it ever came to the
point? Suppose some day some working-man
tfime to you, and told you he loved you ; that he
oould sea how toil might be ennobled, if
you would helu him to do it there would bo an end
of your philosophy. You would think of the cot-
tage to live in, the floors to scrub; the rough
neighbours, the coarse common life, the children
to tend, and make, and mend, and sew for ; and if
you could get over that, there would be the man
nimself —a great rough fellow —a workman, not a
#entlemiii, a man of rough speech, like—like our
■ort. You would have to work for him, too ;to
cook, and sew, and wash for him; to obey him—
you. When he said ‘Do this,’ you must do it,
and when he called * Come here !’ you must go to
him. That’s the way amongst ns working people.
What about the ennobling of toil then?”
He spoke joeringly, and hated himself for doing
so ; and listened for her answer in a state of wild,
if silent, excitement.
Her hands had dropped, her eyes had sunk, her
face was burning: she turned away. If he could
have trusted himself to move or speak, he would
have fallen upon his knees and begged her pardon.
“Oh Myles!” said she, at last, in a very low
voice. Ho bit his lip till the blood came at that
sound; the most maddening, in its mingled sweet-
ness and bitterness, he had ever heard. “ I sup-
pose I gave you the right to say that,” she said,
“and to demand an answer too. You put it
tersely, certainly. As you speak, I can see the
vary life rising before mo that you picture.”
“And yourself in it?” said he, still withasneer,
though ho would have given the world to ask her
to forgive him.
“ No. Yon forgot something,” she replied,
walking to the window, while he still leaned
against the mantlepiece. “ You made it all hard
and sordid. Yon forgot the very ‘ ennobling ’ that
began the discussion. I could fancy myself in
such a homo —a working man’s wife —but to be-
come that, I must love that man ; and in the life
you described there was no love. The man I
loved, be workman or prince, must bo a gentleman
—cot a brute.”
“ Ah ! and supposing yon met this working-man
—or whoever he might be ?” suggested Myles, in
a calm, restrained kind of voice.
“ If I met him, and if I loved him, and he loved
me, and asked me to marry him, I would say
‘ yes ’; and I would love him, and serve him faith-
fully to the end of my life.”
The words fell softly and gently, almost timor-
ously, as if she hesitated to speak of such a thing;
and yet with a certain gentle firmness which said
that they were no sentimental verbiage, but ex-
pressed the steadfast feeling of a steadfast heart.
Bat each word was like a drop of liquid firo in the
young man’s veins. She seemed suddenly to be
close beside him—a possibility, a thing ho might
dream of fifty thousand times higher and farther
off, and more impossible to him than ever. How
could he ever hope to bend that heart to love him ?
The very thought was insanity.
Ho mastered his emotion aiid walked up to her.
She turned, but did not look at him.
“ I jour pardon, most humbly,” said he.
It is granted freely. I dare say it has been
grood for me : it has reduced my vague theories to
the language of common sense.' I had no right to
reproach you with the faults of your class, and
expect nothing but milk and honey from your lips
in return. We understand each other. Oh, but
yours is a biting tongue ! It cuts like a knife.”
It forgot itself when it turned against you .
But, remember, your words had roused me. You
made mo blush for my own ‘ vague theories,’ as
you call them. If you could not have said what
you did to any other workman, do you suppose I
could have spoken so to any other young lady ?”
Ho, no. I suppose not,” said she, but her
face was still downcast. The glance which ho at
last received wavered almost timidly. She re-
sumed her seat and her work, saying : “ And you
will think of what I have said?”
I will—seriously. I believe you are right, but
the thing was too wonderful for mo. I could not
attain unto it —all at one* 1 . ”
The conversation was turned, as if by one con-
sent, to books. Adrienne s heart was boating un-
wontodly fast; her knight had not only surprised,
but somewhat subdued her ; delighting her at the
same time. Ho was no tool; he could turn upon
her, and ho had the front of a ruler. That glance
aud that voice were not to bo forgotten. She
was glad he had not gone ; the sensation that he
was still there was pleasurable, with a strange
potency of strength,
The door opener!, and Mr. Blisset was wheeled
in, and a servant brought afternoon tea. Then
Mr. Blisset began to talk, and Myles to listen.
Mr. Blisset had some of his niece’s conversational
power. The time flew insensibly till supper was
announced. Myles rose, fearing ho had intruded
too long.
_ “ No,” said Mr. Blisset. “ Stay, unless you are
tired, and my niece will give us some music.”
He looked at her, and she said, “Yes, do
stay!” And Myles stayed.
That evening Adrienne sang some songs. She
finished with ‘ Neue Liohe, neues Lehen,’ and
Myles went home with its last passionate words
ringing in his ears :
“ I/iebe, Liehe, lass’ mich los /”
Would it over “ let him him loose,” that love
which had sprung up so suddenly and strongly,
making every other feeling weak in the glow of its
might and strength ?
CHAPTER XI.
PROMISE 8.
That visit was but the first of a long series. Mr.
Blisset was pleased to see the young man who
listened so patiently and so deferentially to him,
and Myles had an ever-growing conviction that
Mr. Blisset’s views of men and things, of right
and wrong, were deeper and sounder than his
own; riper, truer, and more justly balanced.
Myles learnt much in these visits and conversa-
tions.
Adrienne had been many times to the cottage on
the Townfield. and had completely won the hearts
of Mary and Edmund. She had opened up a new
field of delight and wonder to the boy, by putting
him in the way of studying botany, and his en-
thusiasm knew no bounds. She lent him books
and specimens, and Harry Ashworth, who was a
groat walker, brought him all kinds of plants, and
ferns, aud mosses, from the moors on which he
was wont to spend his Saturday afternoons and
Sunday mornings.
When Myles and Adrienne were in his house at
the same time, they seemed to have little to say
to each other; which was, perhaps, not surpris-
ing, for their subjects were not those discussed
by Mary and Edmund. Harry Ashworth had a
great deal to ask Miss Blisset about music; she
comforted him, too, for she helped him to some
scientific understanding of the mighty harmonies
of which he was fast losing the outward apprehen-
sion. Harry had not read much about music or
musicians; he had, while his hearing had been
pretty good, contented himself with drinking in
the sounds themselves. Adrienne soon discovered
that the sorrow of his life was his failing hearing,
and one evening it occurred to her to tell him the
story of Beethoven. Mary and Harry and she
happened to be alone. Adrienne began, and re-
lated the saddest of stories. It had the effect she
intended.
Harry sat with one hand shading his face, in an
attitude which he had assumed soon after she
began the story, when she said : “ And at last he
wrote to one of his friends and confessed that he
was growing quite deaf—that if he went to the
opera, he must sit close to the orchestra, and even
then, leaning over towards it, he could scarcely
hear. ’ ’
Mary went on knitting. Adrienne’s voice,
somewhat raised, slow, distinct and clear, told the
tale of that mighty genius—Christlike in the im-
mensity of his woe, and the uttorness of his separ-
ation from those around him. She went through
it all. She told him about the great symphonies,
about Beethoven’s one or two sad, luckless love-
episodes ; his poverty ; his love for the thankless
young profligate, his nephew ; the performance
of the Choral Symphony—of that great adagio
“ in which we discern the slowly stalking move-
ment of a god!”
“ When it was over,” Adrienne went on, “ the
audience were almost mad with rapture and de-
light, and the applause was deafening—thunder-
ing—it resounded through and through the great
room P the master still stood with his baton in his
hand, his back to the audience, till one of the
vocalists gently turned him round, and he saw
them all —how they were wild with pleasure and
emotion; he had thus moved them by his heavenly
music to ‘joy,’ and he had heard no sound of it
all.”
(to be continued.)
Town Amusements.
THEATRE ROYAL.
“ Our Boys ” has been the attraction at the Royal
during' the week, and the London Comedy Company
have given the piece a grand representation. Mr.
Marshall has made another grand hit in Perkin
Middlewick, the ponrtrayal being faultless and
intensely popular. Mr. Arthur Garner has given
a very able version of Sir Geoffrey Champneys,
and Miss Alma Stanton as Violet Melrose and
Miss Annie Taylor as Belinda have been highly
successful. The other characters, sustained by
Miss Marion Stammers, Mr. Tithoradge, and Mr.
Prank Cates, have lost nothing of their attractions,
and “ Our Boys” is destined for a good run.
The Victoria Theatre.
Grattan Riggs, in the “ Irish Detective,” has
been drawing largo houses. His success here is ,
equal to that of his career in Melbourne, which
was a perfect triumph. Mr. Riggs is ably assisted
by Miss Kate Foley, Miss Flora Anstoad, and
Mr. Greville.
The Queen’s Theatre.
Mr. Alfred Dam pier closed his lengthy season
Last Saturday night. “Richard III.” was pro-
duced, and the house was crowded. Mr. Dampier
pourtrayed the character with consummate skill,
birt can hardly be said to have been played up to.
Miss Sallie Do Angelis. Mr. Jeff. De Angelis, and
Mr. Maas succeeded Mr. Dampier, in Character
Sketches, which are drawing well.
Kelly and Leon’s Opera House.
The Loftns Troune re-open at this house on
Saturday, with new sensations and novelties.
Good-bye to Mrs. Brown.
The bulletin of entertainments for the ensuing
week numbers nothing more enjoyable than
Arthur Skotchley’s delightfully clever “ Adven-
tures of Mrs. Brown,” which ho will give for the
last time in Sydney, prior to his departure on a
provincial tour, on Monday evening, at the School
of Arts, the occasion being a complimentary bene-
fit tendered to Mr. Skotchley by a committee of
gentlemen, including many of the most influential
citizens of Sydney. Lord and Lady Augustus
Loftns are expected to bo present, and so are the
great majority of the ten thousand subscribers to
The Bulletin. It is the least that we, as a
literary community, can do to show our esteem
for one of England’s most talented literati. Dur-
ing the ensuing week Mr. Sketchley will have the
pleasure of introducing “ Mrs. Brown ” to the
public of Bathurst, Orange, Wellington, Dubbo,
Forbes, Mndgee, and that neighbourhood, and we
feel sure that the inhabitants will be only too
delighted to make the amiable lady’s acquaint-
ance. Mr. Sketchley’s latest brochure, “ Mrs.
Brown in Sydney,” with little sly hits at some
well-known Sydney charaders, will be published
in a few days.
Concert at the Glebe.
A new Town Hall was opened at the Glebe on
Thursday. To celebrate the event there was a
musical entertainment in the evening, under the
direction of Herr Hugo Alpon, conductor of the
rapidly improving Glebe Musical Union. The
principal feature was the rendition of a Cantata
by the conductor himself. It is too late to speak
of the work in detail on the present occasion.
Without making any pretension to grandeur of
style as a musical composition, it has a vein of re-
markably pleasing melody running through the
whole work, and some of the numbers are catch-
ing and possess a delightfully flowing rhythm. A
march in it is very happy, though the words are
scarcely metrical enoagh for this kind of com-
position. The admission to the concert was by
invitation of the Mayor, and the guests were
highly delighted with the entertainment.
Chiarini’s Circus.
Signor Chiarini announces this to be the last
week but one of the Circus. Those who wish to
witness this grand show had better take time by
the forelock, as on these last nights there are
bound to be bumper houses.
Egyptian Hall.
Another Novelty.—At blio above hall in George-
street the most marvellous sleight-of-hand tricks
are performed by a troupe of Afghans. The ven-
triloquist of the company is a wonder—his imita-
tion of a crying baby and a howling dog have never
been listened to here before. There are also
scenes illustrative of the Zulu War and other
curiosities.
Mercantile Rowing Club Ball.
The stewards of the above club are determined
to make this season’s reunion a still greater suc-
cess than last years’s.
Glebe Rowing Club Ball.
The above club will hold their first Annual Ball
in the New Town Hall, St. John’s Road, on the
9th July.
Walking Match.
The walking match between Taylor and Baker,
which is now in progress at the Exhibition, Prince
Alfred Park, is the most interesting event yet
witnessed here in the walking line, and its close-
ness merits a good attendance.
Colonial Produce.
Fob the last four months farmers and others
whoso produce arrives here by railway complain
that the high charge made by Government on
“returned empties,” such as cases, hen-coops,
and other packages which are rated at from 2d up
to 3s 6d per package and amount in many instances
to one-half of the carriage already paid in coming
to market, is acting more or less injuriously to all
persons interested. Before the period named
above returned empties went free,and the steamers
and vessels trading to our rivers, the Clarence,
etc., never make any charge on such. Thus, the
farmers living on the line of railway stand at a
disadvantage to those located where water com-
munication exists. _ Mr. Seaforth Proctor and
others are a xmt bring this great grievance before
the notice,of the railway authorities.
