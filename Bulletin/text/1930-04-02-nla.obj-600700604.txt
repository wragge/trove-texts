heart.
£lOO will be paid to any-
one proving this is
not a safe and effective
remedy, bearing a genuine
London doctor’s signature.
There is nothing to equal Harrison’s
Pills for those dizzy, nervy spells
that make life a burden to many
women, and for the special, ills
that make men old as much as
20 years before their time.
One user says : “Since taking Harri-
son’s Fills I have felt years
younger.”
Another: “1 would have tried
Harrison's Fills long ago but had
beer, disappointed with so many
other things. My sister gave me
some to try three weeks ago, and
I must say the pills are wonderful.
I am now quite free from rheumatic
pains which hare bothered, me for
years.”
No Benefit—No Cost!
You risk nothing by trying Harri-
son’s Pills. Marked benefit is
definitely guaranteed with the very
first bottle ; if you fail to get such
benefit, the price paid will be re-
funded by the Amalgamated

THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting' point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beinp destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
t'.kely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bMh
tericidally as is creosote.”

Some Writers and Some Critics
According to Cabell, who tempers his
irony with humor, Job of Uz was first of
all people to betray the characteristics of a
born reviewer “by his disparaging resume of
the universe, and his unconcealed desire to
have his enemy write a book.” There is
not given to all of us a capacity, or even
a desire, to write a novel. But should
we do so, then is our heart upon our sleeve
for inky daws to peck at.
I have been clearing out pigeon-holes
stuffed with judges’ notes on the two
Bulletin novel competitions; and I simply
can’t keep their good things to myself.
We can imagine, the type of thrown-
together novel to which this note applies;
“Rattles along like an old Ford with an
inexperienced driver.” Or this: “Stodgy
fiction seasoned with ‘Deadwood Dick.’ ”
Of another type (and of it there were
many) one judge said: “A vast eruption of
verbiage and maltreated and overworked
words; almost defying dissection”; while a
colleague’s judgment was: “An appalling
diarrhoea of words. Any man who could
get the hang of it would deserve a prize.
I can’t.”
Here is the off-hand condensation of a
high-souled, sugary, sentimental novel as a
preliminary to the smashing verdict: “The
vicar has a sort of platonic flirtation with
the heroine, but they decide they are too
high-minded to marry, and he dies suddenly
in the pulpit.” This is not the only note
about a vicar, though curates seem negli-
gible: “Concerning a vicar, a virgin and
a vagabond. All very edifying and exceed-
ingly dull—except the vagabond.”
A South Pacific yarn: “A nightmarish
story of the Islands with a blood-stained
hero built on Bully Hayes lines. Also the
usual beachcomber, an unsophisticated
maiden and a vile parody of a Stevensonian
cockney. As bad as the worst penny dread-
ful that ever saw print.” Later on the
same reviewer, exasperated, cries: “A mad
sort of yam in which the author gets his
characters into such a tangle at the close
that nobody can tell how, if ever, he meant
it to end or, for that, matter, how it does
end, if it does,” Another candid critic
describes a novel as telling of “an impossible
N. S. Wales coastal town and a fantastic
castle where a dissolute millionaire enter-
tains tile sort, of guests one of ‘Ouida’s’
hosts might have got together. Every
person is utterly unreal and everything
preposterously silly.”
“An astounding story,” says one judge.
“A matured spinster aspiring to reach 100
years of age in full preservation of her
once youthful charms procures a marvellous
string of beads, each bead when swallowed
as prescribed possessing the power of re-
juvenation. In the course of the narrative
the beads come into the possession of a
young person with a lover. He is con-
demned to die and the forlorn maiden
visits him in prison. From her side of the
prison bars she leans forward and kisses
him. In doing so she slips into his mouth
a bead of rejuvenation and swallows one
herself. Tableau: There was a shout of
dismay from the sentries.... The little
girl giggled Say Ta-ta!’ The baby
boy behind the grill cooed and smacked
his ehubby hands, and the baby girl laughed
joyously as she pulled herself up by that
grill which once had confined a man who
lived in fear of the gallows. Meanwhile
a vagrant, pup had made off with the
remainder of the string of beads and ‘flung
it far out into a fast-flowing river.’ This
yarn,” remarks the judge, “paralyses
criticism.”
Some of the judges have been a little
impatient with a type of fly-blown sex
novel—quite a number presented themselves
practically naked and unashamed. One was
tersely dismissed as “full of chatter and
incontinency”; another as “sex freedom,
cocktails and coquetry.” One adjudicator
settled the fate of a novel with the brief
comment “A spineless young fellow has a
couple of footling affairs with polite har-
lots.” As a contrast to all this pronounced
modernism a love story of the mid-Victorian
pattern is described as having “no incidents
except kissing and fainting.” But the
pithiest, of all this potted criticism was the
comment on a novel entitled “The Blanket”
—“Nothing in it, or under it.”
To one judge, who was a specialist in
such matters, fell the duty of making reports
on Backbloek stories; afterwards he drafted
the following:—
Recipe for Squatter Pie.

One wide open space
One call of the bush
One each of curlew, mopoke and kookaburra;

disguised more or less by liquor, impecuni-
osity, or mania for colonial experience

T. B. CLEGG
The Teaching of English
Every jmar we are treated to homilies
on the wretched English our children sub-
mit at the public examinations. To put
the case mildly, the examiners are the
coroners on the corpses of examinees in
English literature, and the pedagogues are
the executioners. It is pretty near the
truth that most Schoolmasters kill in the
child any innate love of good prose or
verse—and the marvel is that, in after life,
meh and women discover in themselves
some latent appreciation of literature
despite the erstwhile pedagogue.
It may be argued that our youth must be
grounded in grammar; but that is no
reason why parsing and analysis should be
applied to literary gems, with the ultimate
result that the child despises the text over
which he has suffered literary indigestion.
Since Gray’s “Elegy” was first let loose
among pedagogues, youngsters sitting for
public examinations have had to analyse
the stanza beginning “The boast of heral-
dry, the pomp of power”—only to see if
they are aware that the verb “awaits” is
singular, and not plural! Again, there are
those teachers who are so much in love
with the subjunctive mood that they simply
cannot resist setting for parsing and
analysis the last glorious stanza of Shelley’s
“Skylark.”
Our examination systetn breeds literary
hypocrisy in our sons and daughters; it
inclines them to intellectual snobbery; it
gives us literary humbugs who will write
as an “appreciation” of anything set for
study the lily-livered “notes” dictated by
the master who 4 filched them from some
annotator’s garbage-tin. To the Devil with
writers of introductions and annotators of
texts! It is not just to childhood that it
should be expected to indulge in textual
critiques and literary criticism, for the
reason that, the child has not the mental
equipment for such nice hobbies. It is
tragic to fail a student because his scan-
sion of a piece of blank verse is not im-
peccable. Those who have read Quiller-
Couch on “The- Merchant of Venice” may
be reasonably sure that most public-school
examiners would “plough” him on his esti-
mate of Portia, and he would be banished
for his statement that Shylock is the only
gentleman in the play.
As I write I have before me a few text-
books used in our schools. A volume of
Lamb’s “Essays” has 50 pages of introduc-
tion, 215 pages of actual text, and 175
pages (in small type) of notes! A “junior
school” copy of “The Merchant of Venice”
boasts 46 pages of introduction, 79 of text,
and 132 pages of notes! In the notes, too.
I noticed that Shakspeare was “guilty of
bad grammar” when he wrote, “moneys is
your suit.” For our edification, it is stated’
“As Shakspeare was essentially a dramatist,
he devoted his attention mainly to the
representation of character and is inatten-
tive to accurate conversation.” What
drivelling idiocy! A volume of Scott’s
“Lord of the Isles” has a six-page preface,
an introduction of 45 pages, and notes to
the tune of 118 pages—and the text, itself
covers only 140 widely-spaced pages. But
why go on?
No child will appreciate literature by
wallowing in notes and introductions, or
achieve a literary perspective by wading
through a morass of verbiage and proper
names and titles of books, flaunting itself
before the innocent and unwary as a
“Primer of English Literature,” or a “Short
History of Literature.” I am old-fashioned
enough to wish a child enjoyment of a
ballad of Robbie Burns or Wordsworth or
Coleridge, without his first signing an affi-
davit that he knows the history of the
Romantic movement.
For heaven’s sake, let us lead our young-
sters into good books, not by “gettinsr”
texts for examination, but by asking (since
examination is allegedly necessary) broad
questions on a child’s general reading on
a syllabus that may be indicated, but never
placed in a strait-jacket. It would be fine
(Red Page continued on page 5.)

SCOTIA.
Trollope in Australia
The writer of this article is a grand-
son of the great novelist. He finds that
Anthony Trollope gets blame in Aus-
tralia for many sins he never com-
mitted, but expects he is dead enough
not to mind.
Trollope was twice in Australia, in 1871
and 1875. The prime object of his coming
was to see his grazier son; but on his first
visit he bore a commission from his pub-
lisher to write a book about the country.
His monumental “Australia and New Zeal-
and” was the result, a book which has been
much misquoted, chiefly by those who have
never read it. He was paid £l3OO for it,
yet the publisher made handsome profits
out of its success, and it is said to have
put up the price of Australian securities
in London at the time. It was not written,
as often supposed, after a flying visit to
the capitals; it was, as he himself tells in
his “Autobiography,” “the result of 15
months’ unflagging labor.” He travelled ex-
tensively in Australia, making close and
careful observation of our conditions, and he
spent some considerable time with his son
on Mortray station, out of Grenfell (N.S.W.),
and thereabout made much of his study of
our bush life. The still extant stump of a tree
in the garden of the homestead there is a
memento of him. He used to sit under
the tree’s shade in the early mornings
making his daily output of literary work
before breakfast.
Curiously Trollope seems to have given
offence to many Australians, though it is
hard to account for the frequent miscon-
ception of his attitude towards us. He
wrote the country up far more than he
wrote it down, and probably was more
enthusiastic over the natural beauties of
the place than anyone else has been, before
or since. But generous as he was in his
praise, he was outspoken in his criticism,
and people resented being taken to task for
their boastfulness, or “blowing,” as he called
it. Jealousies were even stronger in those
times than they are to-day, and he managed
to give offence to all sides by misguided
comparisons. His little wife, too, may have
helped the misapprehension along. She
hated the country, and said many unkind
things about it which probably have been
heaped on to his competent shoulders.
But whence comes the story, only lately
repeated in the “Woman’s Mirror,” that he
said of Australia: “The flowers have no
scent, the birds have no song, and the
women have no virtue”? It has been
so persistently stated to me that I have
constrained myself to labor through much
insufferably dull stuff of his, but I have
not yet been successful in finding it.
I do know, however, that A. L. Gordon
published his “Bush Ballads and Galloping
Rhymes” 12 months before Trollope set
foot in Australia, and the dedication of that
book contains the following lines:—
There are rhymes rudely strung with intent less
Of sounds than of words,
In lands where bright blossoms are scentless,
And soundless bright birds.
Which makes it look as though there has
been a mistake somewhere.
In any case the uncharitableness of the
statement sorts very ill with the kindliness
of the man as we know him in his works
and as I have heard him described by his
friends. He was a sincere lover of beauty,
his tastes running chiefly to color and
form. His chief delight was character,
particularly feminine character. His novels
teem with kindly and understanding
sketches of his women, and his book on
Australia speaks warmly and appreciatively
of the sex out here. His son married an
Australian girl, and Anthony showed her
invariable respect and affection. He used
to love to sit and hear her sing, and there
are still in existence some of the lovely
ballads of the day which he gave to her.
He so much regretted not having a daughter
of his own that he went the length of
adopting a girl into his family. In all, it
seems unthinkable that he should have
used such unkind words about women as
he is accused of having done. The story is
grotesque.
Beyond his big book he did not introduce
Australia much into his work. “Harry
Heathcote of Gangoil” is an exclusively
Australian story, but it is rather poor.
The local part of John Caldigate is better.
One wonders what he intended with a frag-
ment of a sketch-plot which the present
writer found in the cover pocket of a mani-
fold writer at Mortray, where Trollope left
it behind him.
He left something more material than
that there. He sank in the station as
much money as he received for the whole
of the Barchester series of novels.

Bad Smells
I have on my shelf, awaiting a decision
that will probably send it to the destructor,
an American writer’s volume of verse,
issued by a reputable English house. In
one poem the “heroine” has three lovers,
one of whom is her father and another her
brother. Incest was treated by Shelley,
and the world has accepted “The Cenci.”
Even so. But the incest in “The Cenci”
is off stage, whereas in this poem of to-day
it is very much on stage, and is described
with a detail that should bring a blush
to the cheek of a decent-minded man if he
were alone in a thousand-acre paddock.
In another poem in the same book an
unmentionable act of sexual bestiality is
recorded, and apparently the author thinks
it has some emotional or {esthetic value.
There are persons who are not shocked by
these things (or profess not to be), but
surely if there is any reticence in life
at all, such subjects should be excluded.
Otherwise why surround the bodily func-
tions with any walls at all? It is a question,
not of reason, but of instinct, which is
often much the sounder guide. A civilised
man—that is, a man who is really heir to
the ages—recognises a bad smell when he
comes upon it in a book, just as he recog-
nises a bad smell when his drains go wrong.
Both are beyond argument. Monstrous
perversion is as much out of place in an
msthetic book as a midden would be on a
front lawn.
M. L. CRITIC.
A Satchel of Books
Vile Bodies, by Evelyn Waugli (Chapman
and Hall), concerns the demented existence
of London’s Bright Young People. If the
officials who banned “All Quiet” and Aris-
totle were consistent, they would ban this
work, too. Yet it is essentially an elevating
book, being a despairing satire on the life
it depicts; a howl of rage against the cre-
tinous goings-on of Bright Young People who
pursue happiness by way of drunkenness and
promiscuity, and never find it. The humor
is exquisite of its madhouse kind, and there
is restrained beauty in much of the writing.
Venus on Wheels, by Maurice Dekobra
(T. Werner Laurie; Dymocks), is a Palais
Royal farce in novel form. Like all his
books, it has been written with an eye to
the French movie market. The traditional
adulterous husband, turning, as usual, to
strategy to -lure back his idealistic wife,
arranges for her to take a Montmartre
prostitute into the home from which he has
been excluded. The prostitute becomes
respectabilised, and the wife corrupted. She
is on the point of yielding to an absurd
lover when the husband intervenes and the
customary reconciliation occurs. The book is
no doubt funny, in the original, but the
cocotte’s argot has been done impartially into
Cockney (“I’ve got the blinking hump”) and
into Bowery (“Morality brings me out in a
rash”) and the effect is painful.
The H'on. Percival tries to kiss the heroine
of Elizabeth Milton’s Wandring Wood
(Mills and Boon) and John, an Old Bailey
barrister who loves the girl, meets him in
their club afterwards. John throws one of
Percival’s “special devilled Martinis” in his
face, and addresses the members: —
“Gentlemen, I warn him” (the other man cringed
like a beaten cur) “that if he does not apologise
in writing to the one whom he has insulted, and
at the same time send in his resignation to every
club in London of which he may be a member, and
undertake to leave England for two years—l shall
publish the whole story of his dastardly behavior
in every newspaper throughout the length and
breadth of the land, and shall never rest till he is
hounded out of the country for good and all. I
give him three minutes —not a second more—to
make his decision.”
Who writes these preposterous books? Girls
who are too young to know the world, or
women who are so old that they have for-
gotten it? And, in any case, why import
them to Australia?
Essays and Excursions in Law, by F. A.
A. Russell, K.C. (Law Book Co.), is a
rather weird mixture which may be either
tasted or swallowed according to the humor
of the reader, but is hardly fit to be either
chewed or digested. The author has chosen
his subjects at random. Consequently the
reader is tossed hither and thither, from a
dry but doubtless learned discourse on free-
dom of thought to a treatise on the copyright
vested in the manufacturers of Eno’s Fruit
Salts and a particular brand of beer known
as “Stone Ale,” thence to an excursion (oris
it an essay?) which purports to show the
morality of the law as a public censor and in
which the merits and demerits of a “grossly
immoral” novel and an “indescribably vul-
gar” film are freely discussed. Consisting, in
the main, of extracts from judgments’ of
various English and Australian Courts, the
work can hardly be regarded as an accurate
text for either lawyers or laymen, but, by
dint of introducing cases which may be of
some common interest, the author has made
it (in parts) quite readable.

WHO MADE THIS MESS?
The immediate cause of our financial
troubles is transparent; for year after year
we have imported more than we exported.
For the past seven years our deplorable
record has been as follows:
Deficiency ( —) or Interest
Surplus ( 4) Payable on
of Exports. Overseas Loans.
1922- £13,887,688 £21,413,668
1923- 21,131,129 23,248,400
1924- + 4,886,863 23,409,387
1925- 2,866,244 25,435,027
1926- 19,576,227 25,925,995
1927- 4,731.900 29,708,595
1928- -f 1,152,142 30,458,595
£56,154,183 £179,599,667
In seven years we have thus exported nearly
236 millions too little to pay for our
imports and our interest, and we have had
to go into debt for that amount.
But that does not explain why we im-
ported so vastly; and here there is room
for difference of opinion. It is possible
either that we imported because the bor-
rowed money was available to pay for the
imports or that we borrowed because we
wanted to pay for the imports. Were our
extravagances responsible for the loans or
were the loans responsible for our extrava-
gances? To The Bulletin there seems
no doubt whatever that the loans produced
the extravagance. For the politicians who
were responsible for the loans gained
nothing by the extravagance while they did
gain enormously by the loans.
The trouble really began when politicians
discovered that, for the purchase of the
votes on which most of them depend for
their living and all of them for their power,
the entire credit of the State was at their
disposal. Probably no such opportunity was
ever before offered to man. Having once
secured a seat in Parliament, the politician,
along with others of like mind, could
pledge the people’s credit to an extent
limited only by the pocket or the patience
of the lender. Had the people been well
enough educated in finance they would
have refused to have their credit thus
pledged. But for the most part they were
content to be led by the very men who
were personally interested in misleading
them. Instead of setting their faces against
public exploitation, they joined in the
scramble for the spoils, whether it was in
the shape of new works that might improve
their properties, or in the shape of jobs, or
otherwise. Behind it all was the politician
seeking votes for services rendered, and
surest of votes when those sendees were
greatest.
In the end, no doubt, the politician—or
some of him—knew that he was caught in
his own net. An enormous body of men
who had acquired a vested interest in the
spending of loan money—the tens of thou-
sands engaged on public works —insisted on
the continuance of public works; and no
political party dared to risk the displeasure
or votes of these people so long as loans
could be raised. Thus the merry jig went
on; and imports poured into the country
entirely beyond the legitimate needs of the
people. It certainly is possible for loans to
be paid by one country to another in gold;
but loans from John Bull to Australia
never have been paid in gold, and are never
likely to be. In practice what happens is
that the loans are made available to pay
for the foreign goods abroad, and the money
they represent is paid by the importers
through the banks to the borrowing Govern-
ment in Australia.
Unfortunately the trouble has not ended
with the creation of an army of men with
a vested interest in loan-works construction.
Another and greater army has been created
with a vested interest in the operation of
railways and other loan works; and their
influence on the phlitics of Australia is
now immense. These two great bodies of
voters create a problem which sooner or
later must be faced. They are the principal
factor in that political corruption which is
responsible for our present difficulties;
without them'the politician would not have
that great incentive to the multiplication
of State enterprises which has produced not
only our colossal debt but the trebling of
our taxation within a dozen years. It may be
that no Government will attempt the solu-
tion of this problem during the period of
readjustment; yet if it is not attacked
now the chances are that it will be shelved
altogether.
Democracy was long ago defined as gov-
ernment of the people by the people for
the people. We have government of the
people, more or less government by the
people; but government for the people
is a myth. As we know it, government is
for the benefit of the politician. In despair
one nation after another has overturned
democracy and substituted some sort of
autocracy; and the tendency is all that
way. Democracy is the noblest thing in
government ever conceived; but it has not
been able to stand up against the ignorance
and gullibility of the multitude and the
dishonesty of the few. The practical question
now is how ca.n it be saved? There seems
only one way: by retaining for Govern-
ments the job of governing and taking from
them as far as possible the job of running
businesses. The less money they handle
the better; the fewer people they employ
the better; and it seems essential that those
few shall be disqualified as voters so far
as the general roll is concerned. They might
perhaps have a roll of their own; but it is
doubtful whether their representatives in
Parliament should have full voting power
where money bills are concerned.
UNIONISM AS A JOB-LOSER.
There are signs that unionism is going the
way of most idealistic institutions. Nearly
all great devices to defeat sin, poverty or
injustice either get into the hands of ambi-
tious hierarchs or Kaisers, or become embar-
rassing survivals in a world that has out-
grown them. Many of the churches are in
the first category, and the jury system is in
the second. The jury system originated and
developed on the same lines as unionism.
From the twelfth century onwards juries
stood more or less effectively between
honest poverty and corrupt wealth. Union-
ism performed a similar function from the
first half of the nineteenth century onwards.
Universal education, cheap newspapers, the
movies, party politics and other factors are
making anachronisms of both. As recently as
half a century ago jurors could go into
court and hear the evidence in a murder
trial with open minds. Nowadays the
evidence given before the coroner is pub-
lished for its sensationalism, and is argued
about in every home and bar for weeks
before the trial. Half a century ago union-
ism was a defence force; now it is an army
of aggression.
The Kaisers of labor are not altogether
to blame. Modern developments have
changed the outlook of thousands of their
subjects. Retailers of luxury goods have
been telling the world for years, through
their bagmen, the movies and flapper
papers, that workers who do not own cars
and go pony-racing once or twice a week
are oppressed slaves. Unionism in Aus-
tralia was able to stand up to the effects
of this propaganda so long as industry was
able to stand up to it. Now the inevitable
slump has arrived. And unionism, which
like every ancien regime "forgets nothing
and learns nothing,” is still thinking on
pre-slump lines. At Melbourne Theatre
Royal last month two electricians held a
musical comedy up because they were called
on to do work outside their department,
as the Arbitration Court award permits.
This with about 75 per cent, of the pro-
fession unemployed! And in Queensland a
union demands that the award hours shall
be reduced from 44 to 40 per week—this
at a time when it has been disclosed that
the nation has been buying 40 millions a
year more than it could pay for by reason
of producing too little!
It is significant that militant unionism
has disappeared in the only two countries
that are being run primarily in the interests
of the workers—Russia and Italy. The
slogan in both is not “Higher and higher
wages” (which experience has shown means
cars and race-meetings for the aristocracy
of the proletariat and unemployment for
the less fortunate) but “More and more
production,” which means harder work but
also less national and individual poverty.
That Russia is no place for loafers is shown
by recent Soviet Government figures:—
“The output of the electrical industry in
1927-28 increased three times as compared
with pre-war standard. As regards general
machine building, the Soviet Republic
reached 164 per cent, in 1927-28 as compared
with the pre-war production, and almost
200 per cent, with regard to the building
of agricultural implements.”
Coal output, which was under 29 million
tons in 1913, was 35-| million tons in 1928.
All this is part of the Five Year Plan,
whose object is “to enable the Soviet
Republic to equal and eventually over-
take the advanced countries in industrial
production.” Italy, by a national campaign,
increased its wheat production last season by
20 million quintals—a record. There, as in
Russia, strikes are barred, and loyalty to
the nation has taken the place of union
loyalty.
Australia will adopt this policy, or a
modification of it, once the workers grasp
that a movement which was a boon to
the under-dog when social and political
conditions bore no resemblance to those
of our day, has since degenerated into an
instrument of tyranny in the hands of a
privileged class. Unionism no doubt has
many years of useful life before it here,
but only if it purges itself of its selfish mili-
tants, and faces the plain truth, that this
is an era when neither an industry nor a
nation can live indefinitely beyond its
earnings.
THE ARMAMENTS OF EUROPE.
Great fear, amounting almost to terror, has
been expressed lest the Five-Power Naval
Conference should fail. France has been
the difficulty all along, with its reluctance
to reduce its naval strength according to
United States ideas. Britain fell in cor-
dially with these United States ideas; but
then Ramsay MacDonald always does fall
in with U.S. ideas, and, besides, he wants to
save every possible copper on defence and
spend the money in doles for the unem-
ployed.
France has a good claim to at least as
strong a navy as Uncle Hoover, measured
by tonnage or any other way. It has about
six times as much oversea territory to
defend as Uncle has even when Alaska is
included, and that bulky and frozen depen-
dency with a declining population isn’t
exactly oversea. In addition, France has
only about one-fourteenth as much homo-
geneous home territory to rely on as the
G. Washington republic is blessed with.
Then it accepted mandates over some of
the ex-German possessions, while the United
States resolutely declined. Uncle Hoover
has never failed to accept land in full
sovereignty when the chance offered; but
a mandate is burden and worry with no
certainty of profit, and the holder of it
has the permanent hatred of Germany, now
on the way to be a Great Power again, as
his surest reward. Moreover, France has
dangerous neighbors right at its gates, while
Uncle Hoover has no neighbors at all save
Mexico, Panama and Canada. The first
two are not taken seriously, and Canada
becomes a less serious proposition the more
Britain disarms as a sea Power.
There is always room for a feeling of
uneasy wonderment why the United States,
which makes a fetich of keeping out of
European affairs, though it was driven into
them much against its will in 1917, and
which avoids the League of Nations as if
it was a serpent, should take so much
interest in the disarmament of Europe.
Coupled with the stupendous schemes of
naval expansion with which it has amused
itself in recent years and still amuses itself
at intervals, this interest has excited specu-
lation as to whether the germ of conquest
is in Uncle’s soul, and is about to develop.
In a casual way he has collected territory
from Britain (on the Pacific coast, for the
original War of Independence was before
he became an independent and recognised
Uncle); from the Indians, whom he stripped
bare; from the Spaniards (twice); from
the Mexicans (twice); from the Colom-
bians, and from the Hawaiians. Of late
he has been assuming an acquisitive
attitude over the newly-found Antarctic
continent by reason of something a U.S.
officer is said to have done 90 years ago.
Indeed, barring the Bolshevik, Uncle
Hoover is the best imitation of an in
cipient Ciesar that the world knows at th
m Nobody will be hurt if France stands
out of every suggested naval arrangeme -
Britain, at any rate, isn’t in the feast afraid
of any proposed French navy; it ,

tunnel under the Strait of Dover, w

apart from the navy.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Improving the Jury System.
“Bill O’Costs”: Three obvious methods
stare us in the face. The first is largely to
improve the jury out of existence, by dis-
pensing with it in all civil cases and m all
criminal ones except those of such gravity
that Judges fight shy of the responsibility.
The second is to get a better class of eli-
gibles and to prevent the weeding out of
the more intelligent of them by challenge
and the planting-in of the corrupt or grossly
biased. The third improvement over-
shadows all others, and is available it
Judges had the courage to employ it; that
is, to see that the jury discharges its proper
function—to find the facts.
Our comforting legal theory is that the
Judge finds the law and the jury the facts.
It is not so by any means. In practice
the Judge directs the jury on what he
believes to be the law, and further directs
them to apply that law (very often in
most involved and confusing fashion) to
the facts as found. The result as often as
not is a mere befogging of jurors’ brains.
In effect, they are left to find Whatever
facts and law they please, and, with a
simple one- or two-word verdict, no one
ever knows what facts or law they did
actually decide.
The relevant facts should be found by
a series of questions, the answers to which
clear the way for the skilled lawyer: “Did
the accused take the prosecutor’s money?—
intending to steal it?—or with What inten-
tion?” and so forth, according to the nature
of the case and evidence. On the answers
the rest should be easy, and a court of
appeal could always review mistakes in the
law, with the added advantage of knowing
when and where the mistake, if any, had
been made. There is no opening under
such a method either for the modern Jef-
freys or Scroggs to overbear a jury with
what they must find in view of law and f
facts, or for the “give-the-poor-bloke-a-
show” verdict regardless of evidence.
It is rather appalling to think of the
mass of miscarriages of justice that load
our law reports (and they are only the
fraction that come under review) due to
misdirection, non-direction and misunder-
stood direction. The effect, or possible
effect, of these is always assumed by courts
of appeal, in spite of probabilities, because
no one can ever say why a jury came to
a particular conclusion.
What is wanted is merely a legislative
direction that Judges shall require juries
to bring in their findings of fact in answer
to proper questions in the same way as
what is sometimes called a “special verdict.
Incidentally, the way of the Bar rhetori-
cians with their “It is for you to say
whether the accused is guilty” would he a,
little harder when they _ knew that this
would be stopped with a judicial “Not so;
it is for the jury to say whether this or that
is the fact.”
Railways and Other Assets.
In Australia’s museum of self-deceptions a
valuable exhibit is the vague idea that the
railways can be sold some day or almost,
any day, and when that is done there will
be an end of all serious financial difficulties.
It is merely a matter of sacrificing the
principle or fad or whatever it may be of
public ownership, and then the nightmare
of interest bills will pass away.
This idea is entertained by the most
unlikely people, including Premiers, ex-
Premiers and newspaper writers, so it
is a matter of interest to consider what
Australia really pays for the use of other
people’s money, and what assets it has to
show for the debt, and (in theory) to
sell if so inclined:—
Annual
Purpose of Loans. Interest.
Railways (State and Federal) .. .. £15,500,000
Water supply, etc. (State) . . • • 5,600,000
Harbors, rivers, roads, bridges (State) .. 3,800,000
Buildings of all sorts (State) . . ..
Help to settlers (State) f’nnn nnn
Small sundries (State) 000,000
War (Federal) •• .... • - • • 15,100,000
Posts, telegraphs, etc., including Canberra
(Federal) 4 > ooo > ooo
£54,929,000
This calculation, which is, at least, fairly
accurate, casts a gloom on the pleasant
theory that Australia has loan assets which
can be sold at any time to a British or
Yankee syndicate to the marvellous relief
0 f financial stress. Many are unproductive,
and the great bulk, whether productive or
not are too scattered and sketchy to be
put on the market. If the railways could
be sold at their nominal value, and that
liability could be removed from the
national shoulders, there would still be so
much liability left that the relief wouldnt
be tremendous.
And any syndicate which offered to buy
the railway system would almost certainly
demand guarantees which are not taken into
consideration. It would demand that poli-
ticians must cease to go about promising
new lines promiscuously, at election or
other times, without its consent, and that


NOT A GOOD BOY YET.
“Railwaymen—Longer Working Week —Unions Will Fight It.” —Typical heading of the past weeks news.
MOTHER BRITANNIA: “John, can’t the child come out of the corner? I think he’ll be good now!”
JOHN, HER HUSBAND: “Oh, will he? Then what has he scribbled THAT on the wall for?”
Parliament must not order it to build
branches and additions, and to chance the
consequences. The difficulty might be met
by the State subsidising new lines which
were forced on the syndicate against its
will, but that would be merely piling up a
new liability. And private railway-owners
might want positive assurance that arbi-
tration courts and the like wouldn’t treat
them after the offhand fashion which has
been the ill-luck of public owners in recent
years.
Apart from all this, the position is that
about 6s. in the £ of loan money is laid
out on railways and 14s. on other items.
It might be a blessed idea to hunt for
a syndicate which would buy the other
items at cost. The move would lead to
nothing, but’ it would be an experience.
♦—
Queensland Coast Railway.
“Nottus”: Apropos the railway delays at
flooded bridges in Queensland (B. 12/3/’3O),
the whole thing boils down to this. Is it
better to have low-level bridges which are
flooded for a few days at a time every wet
season, or high-level bridges, much more
costly, which will finish somewhere in the
Pacific when the first flood comes down, and
completely disrupt traffic maybe for
months?
The advantage of the low-level struc-
tures lies in the fact that as soon as the
rivers rise the waters rapidly submerge the
bridges, and debris, which includes logs and
sometimes whole trees (no toothpicks
either), is carried over the top in safety.
There is no guaranteeing the heights of the
floods which occur with painful regularity,
so the generally low nature of the country
near the rivers would necessitate miles of
spiderjr trestle-work and embankments.
Where northerners have a kick coming,
however, is that mails are frequently held at
Townsville in the vain hope that a train will
get over the flooded Herbert, Tully, John-
stone or Mulgrave when the bags could easily
be sent by boat to Innisfail or Cairns.

The Westralian Elections.
Last year saw the first Redistribution Bill
passed in Westralia for nearly two decades,
which invests the general election on April
12 with unusual interest. Indeed, the State
can hardly be said to have had a represen-
tative Assembly since 1911. Even then the
drift of population off the goldfields was
pronounced, and since then it has con-
tinued steadily and inexorably. As far back
as 1913 a Labor Government was consider-
ing the abolition or amalgamation of two
or three of the rottenest of the rotten
boroughs, but the war came and diverted
attention from the scandal of a few hundred
electors in decaying mining settlements
having the same voting power > as a few
thousands in the coastal districts and the
wheat belt. The drift continued, and seven
years ago the Mitchell Government
appointed a commission outside of Parlia-
ment to redistribute the electorates. The
commissioners were civil servants who
couldn’t be accused of political bias, but
their recommendations were bitterly
opposed by the Labor Opposition, and two
or three Ministerialists who saw their own
seats endangered by altered boundaries
proved just as hostile. A stronger man
than Mitchell would have risked every-
thing on carrying the bill; but Mitchell
was never a determined fighter, and he
caved in. Labor returned to office in 1924,
after eight years on the Opposition benches,
by means of the rotten boroughs. It still
clung desperately to them in 1927, although
some were near to putridity by this time,
and just managed to keep its majority.
But it was clear that the country could not
be faced again if the scandal was per-
petuated any longer; and, although the
long-delayed Redistribution Bill might have
gone a good deal further, it was at least
an attempt to remove some of the most
crying abuses.
In the present elections nine Labor can-
didates have been returned unopposed, and
for two more seats only Labor candidates
are standing. On the other hand, two
Oppositionists have had walks-over and in
seven contested seats there are no Labor
candidates. The other 30 seats will decide
the issue, and votes will at all events have
fairer values than they have carried for
many years. But none of the issues are
overwhelmingly great. Largely the elec-
torates are concerned in weighing persons;
and that is not a bad thing when the imme-
diate needs are administrative rather than
legislative. On the one side is Collier, who
has the sins of the past two Parliaments
to answer for; on the other Mitchell, whose
earlier sins are well remembered. Rarely
indeed can a Ministry last into a third
Parliament; that it is even possible in Col-
lier’s case shows that this is an exceptional
man. Without being brilliant he has that
large, plain commonsense which has been
the outstanding feature of Australia’s most
successful administrative Premiers, includ-
ing John Forrest himself; and, since The
Bulletin would rather trust him in this
present crisis than an opponent who appar-
ently can see salvation only in borrowing,
he goes to the polls with this paper’s
blessing.
Coal and Coal Strikes.
A preliminary announcement says the
mineral output of N. S. Wales for 1929 was
worth £12,750,000. This was £2,500,000 less
than the figure for 1928, which was previous
to the present coal shindy, though there
was plenty of coal shindy that year, too.
In fact, since 1914 no 12 months have
elapsed without at least 99 strikes in the
Newcastle-Maitland pits. Taking the value
of the coal output separately, the falling
away in 1929 a? compared with 1928 was
£2,311,000, and the falling away in 1928
as compared with 1927 was £1,500,000.
From this it is obvious that the slump
in the coal business has been a matter not
of the past 12 months but of years, and
that there are causes beyond the present
lockout or strike.
On the average there was a loss of
560,000 days’ work per annum through
strikes or lockouts during the past 15 years;
and that looks serious enough to account for
a large slump. Yet it is by no means cer-
tain that this lost time was a very large
factor; for a large proportion of the lost
days were made up by working an equal
number of days when the mines would
otherwise have been idle.
The chief trouble with Newcastle —and it
is a trouble that is not getting any notice
worth mentioning—is that at least one-
third too many men have been engaged iti
the industry; in other words, the coal-
purchaser has had to pay for three men
when he ought to have been paying for
only two. This may be a bad time to
attempt a redistribution of labor; all the
same, we shall never get coal hewn for a
fair price so long as the present conditions
last, and we shall never place ourselves in
a fair position to meet and beat com-
petitors in the foreign market.
But not even complete reform within the
mines will restablish our coal-export trade
without the modernisation of shipping facili-
ties at Newcastle. For 20 years at least
Newcastle has had a thoroughly evil name
in the coal-importing harbors of the world,
not only for its bad entrance but for the
obsolete character of the coal-loading cranes
—mostly hydraulic, though the electric has
long since superseded this elsewhere.

The Case of ’Bus v. Tram.
A wrangle which has been taking place
between N. S. Wales Minister Bruxner
and the motor-’bus owners of the State
has been productive of some very illuminat-
ing figures touching on the tram v. ’bus
controversy. Bruxner’s Transport Bill pro-
poses to put both trams and ’buses under
control of public trusts, with provision for
making the ’bus proprietors pay for the
roads they use. The ’bus proprietors are
roaring like bulls of Bashan, but all the
evidence so far adduced goes to show that
they have been sitting on velvet and are
roaring now because the velvet is being
pulled from under them.
According to Bruxner, whose figures have
not been seriously challenged by the other
side, the position, considering tram-cum-
’bus transport as a joint concern, is that
the ’buses, in which the capital investment
is £560,000, handle one-fifth of the traffic
and rake in one-fourth of the revenue, their
share amounting to £1,500,000 per annum,
or a gross return of 267 per cent, on capital.
The tramways, with a capital cost of
£11,740,000, handle four-fifths of the traffic
for a gross return of £4,460,000, which is
only 37 per cent, on capital.
What the working expenses of the ’buses
are nobody knows but the owners, but
there is one big item that figures in the
tramway accounts —£703,470 for “main-
tenance and renewals of permanent way and
structures”—that is paralleled on the ’bus-
owners’ books only by the charges on a
handful of garages. The “permanent way”
of the ’buses is provided nearly free of cost
by the State and municipalities—’bus
license fees are a mere bagatelle that does
not pretend to balance the value of their
road-using privilege.
As the trams are publicly owned and the
’buses are not, an attempt to equalise the
odds, so far from being an outrage, is the
plain and imperative duty of the Govern-
ment. In the United States, as shown by the
report of a N.S.W. Government officer, S.
A. Maddocks, who went abroad to investi-
gate such problems, these matters are much
better regulated, and the big cities of Britain
are also moving to curtail the care-free
merry-jig of the ’bus proprietors. The
sooner Australian cities fall into line the
better for the taxpayers.

The Wheat Pool.
Dear Bulletin, —Re the wheat pool: the
farmers will, I suppose, be paid in Aus-
tralian paper money. But four Australian
shillings are now worth only three and
ninepence abroad, where the wheat will be
sold. Will the Government keep the profit
on the exchange? The farmers should
stipulate for payment on a gold basis.—
Yours, etc., A. A. Watson.
An Empire Bargain-sale.
London “Daily News,” the official organ of
the Liberal Bump in Britain, has given a
useful lead to the Egyptian delegates now
in England to discuss the final terms of
the Henderson treaty. The “News” points
out that in its opinion—which, of course,
is that of the Liberal remnant —Britain has
no right to lay claim to the guardianship
of the Suez Canal. As the avowed object
of the Egyptians is to gain control of the
waterway, they will probably be quick to
seek the assistance of the Liberals. Whether
that will be accorded to them will depend
on the bargain for place and power that
Lloyd George can strike in the negotiations
for a coalition Lab.-Lib. Government which
are now pending, and without which the
Labor Government must cease to exist.
Australia, more interested in the control
of the canal that any other self-governing
section of the Empire, has been utterly
ignored by the bargain-makers. And, unfor-
tunately, the Government now controlling
the affairs of the Commonwealth is com-
posed of the wrong ingredients to make
the protest against the Egyptian objective
which Australia’s national interest so
emphatically demands.
Deaths in Childbirth.
“Fabius”: I heartily agree with The
Bulletin’s comments on Dame Janet
Campbell’s report on our maternal mor-
tality. But, speaking from the standpoint of
a general practitioner, I do not anticipate
great improvement. Maternity is work, and
very specialised work; yet how many girl-
wives take their lives in their hands through
ignorance and have “bad confinements”
leading to chronic ill-health or death? And
ignorance is no worse than ultra-sophistica-
tion. Continued birth-control, and where
this fails the procuring of abortion, is com-
mon ; such practices tend to render the
offender unfit for maternity later, and, even
if they do not swell the death-rate, bad
health is almost inevitable.
These two extremes are the culprits, and
will escape any pre-natal measures unless
some stern dictator will see that our future
mothers are equal to their task, and that
marriage is not a shield for criminal
evasion of consequences.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Mr. Piddington dissented from his col-
leagues, as usual, in the N.S.W. Industrial
Court the other day, and showed that he
still has a fine opinion of Mr. Piddington.
It was a matter of varying an award,
Mr. Moses Piddington.
and Mr. Pid-
dington was of
opinion that
once Moses had
laid down the
law the matter
was ended for
ever. “It is
one of the mis-
chiefs of our
times,” said his
Honor, “t hat
employees are
so often de-
prived of what
they have
gained, and thus
are compelled to
struggle over
again to main-
t a i n ground
that they had
won.” The idea
that they might
have had their
case heard by
some poor self-
deluded idealist,
and been grant-
cd something that was economically impos-
sible, never, of course, occurred to Mr. Moses
Piddington.
Earle Page, the greatest disaster that ever
reached the Treasury in Australia, talked
to the conference of the Vic. Country party
the other night at Benalla, and showed not
a glimmering of knowledge regarding the
present financial crisis. His chief lament
was that the Scullidores had raised the
tariff, thereby increasing cost: of production,
and so making exports more difficult. Appa-
rently Page doesn’t yet know that Australian
gold and credit are so scarce in London that
they have to be conserved hard in order to
pay interest bills falling due, and that the
only way to stop the flood of imports which
was rapidly making the position impossible
was to bump up the tariff. If the cost of
production was reduced 99 per cent, we
couldn’t land either wool or wheat in Eng-
land in time to save the situation.
Another £1,000,000 of gold was shipped
away last week by the Commonwealth Bank
to pay interest on foreign debt and help to
pay for surplus imports. This was partly
its own money, and partly sovereigns taken
from the joint-stock banks, they getting
notes or Government securities in exchange.
Present arrangements are said to be that
£25,000,000 is to be shipped away during
the financial year, and this makes £18,000,000.
Something more will have to be done to
suppress the importing disease, otherwise the
tank in which the sovereigns are stored may
run dry at a bad moment.
The million which is being negotiated in
New York by the Sydney Water and Sewer-
age Board is probably as reasonable as could
be expected. Interest will be about £6 14s.
per cent., and there is to be a sinking fund
which will repay the debt in full on the
hour of maturity. Uncle Hoover doesn’t
believe in any slipshod renewal business. The
fund isn’t to be paper like the one which
Bruce-Page devised, but genuine money, and
Uncle is to receive the instalments and invest
them in his own country as a precaution
against swindles. About the only stipulation
he hasn’t made is that he should hold the
entire loan as well as the bonds and the
interest and the sinking fund.
Sanity settled a dispute at Isa (N.Q.) the
other day. Three men loafing on a shift
were dismissed, and the usual strike fol-
lowed. The A.W.U. ordered the strikers
back to work, admitted they were loafing,
and asked for their re-instatement on condi-
dition they pulled their weight in future. This
was done to the general satisfaction. If
Bondy Hoare and his fellows had taken
up the attitude of the A.W.U. at the begin-
ning of the N.S.W. coal dispute, there might
have been a different morning-after to that
which is dawning now.
In his in-
tcnse desire to
recover the
office which he
lust in 1923,
Westralian
Jimmy Mitchell
promises to re-
duce taxes. High
taxation, he
says, is the
cause of Aus-
tralia’s troubles.
W estra lia’s
State taxation
(the sore which
a local James
can reduce) is
really the low-
est in the six
States. The tax-
revenue is 775. per head per annum against
a State average of 100 s.
The question of what ought to be done
with Far Western N.'S.W. lands is being
talked and talked about again in Parliament.
Always it is the same—one crowd gets up
and says that the Government proposes to
hand the country over to the Fat Man, and
the other crowd says it would keep the land
free and give the Little Man a chance. Most
of the trouble is due to the two crowds think-
ing of entirely different things. One lot has
its mind on land that might carry a sheep
to six acres in a fair season, while the other
is thinking of land that in its present state
wouldn’t carry a bandicoot to 20 acres ail
the year round. There are millions of acres
of the Far West that will take so much
improving that the only chance of getting
the job done is to hand it out on a long
lease: 50 years isn’t a day too long in many
cases. Ball’s present bill is a fair compro-
mise, though he might well follow it up with
one to help restock the small holdings that
five years’ drought has desolated.
The Taxation Departments don’t show
much disposition to encourage philanthropy
and public spirit amongst civil servants.
N. S. Wales Chief Railway Commissioner
Cleary, who has decided to take only half
of his £5OOO a year, £2OOO being donated
to the unions for the “relief of distress” and
£5OO returned to the Treasury, will be
assessed for income tax on the full £5OOO,
and will have about £lOOO left out of his
screw at the end of the transaction. Cleary
may have other means and isn’t complaining,
but nothing could better ensure that his
example will not bo copied.
Among S. Australia’s pre-election reforms
there are several of
interest to our friend
Mr. Sikes. For the
future (until the poli-
ticians may decide
that it will pay them
better to determine
otherwise) William
may by civility and
strict attention to
business earn sixpence
a day; and with it he
may buy a razor and
keep himself shaved.
Also, whether he bar-
bers himself or not, he
may smoke the even-
ing hours away in his
cell until nine o’clock.
This presumably is to
recall the happiest
hours he spent outside
and make him wish he
had been better. On
the other hand, it may
strike him that he
never had so good a
possie before, and he
may decide to be worse in the future.
It is doubtful if anybody, even themselves,
seriously expected that the Victorian apostles
of Prohibition would secure the 60 per cent,
of votes on Saturday necessary to put the
State into a qualified condition of drouth
and an unqualified welter of confusion. Had
the referendum been carried by the neces-
sary majority, the comic-opera spectacle would
have been shown of a State empowered to
“Follow Me, Little Pet!”
“Shut the door, William , I’ll ring if
I want you.”
close hotels, but not breweries or distilleries,
and equally powerless to prevent liquor com-
ing in from outside. The State would have
had to sacrifice millions annually in revenue,
but how far the cause of temperance, much
less total abstinence, would have profited by
such a topsy-turvy condition of affairs
remains indiscoverable. However, instead of
getting 60 per cent, of the votes polled, the
Drys managed to score only about 44 per
cent.
Respect for tradition and precedent proved
too strong for the Vic. Hogans, and so the
adoption of the Address-in-Reply will be
moved as usual after Baron Somers opens
the Parliamentary session this afternoon.
With a serene contempt for the state of
the money mar-
ket, Opposition-
lea,der Jimmy
Mitchell has un-
ci erta k e n to
build 372 miles
of railway in
West ralia
at a cost of
£1,500,000. That
s £4032 per
nile, and though
\V T estralian rail-
ways are the
cheapest in Aus-
tralia, they
have hitherto
averaged £5382
per mile. Mit-
chell will also
spend £667,000
on roads. After
the railways and
roads are fin-
ished the unem-
, , ployed will be
back again. By way of permanent pro-
vision for them Mitchell guarantees a “broad
policy of land settlement.’’ In short, Incurable
James wants office so that he and his party
may borrow more money than the other
fellows and mortgage the wheat prospects
still more heavily. He hasn’t improved while
in cold storage.
The Australian is the fastest worker in
the world—when he is allowed to be. When
the Malolo was in Sydney the workers on
the Harbor bridge easily broke the world’s
record for one day’s structural steel erection,
a road-making gang at Camden
(N.S..W.) —23 men, all Australian-born—has
laid 350 yards of concrete pavement. 20ft.
wide and Bin. deep, in 9-| hours. But our
whole stupid system has been directed to-
wards the suppression of the good and fast
worker, by cutting out payment by results—in
the interests mainly of the loafer and the fool.
The Imperial Economic Committee has
had to insert a lot of dashes and queries
in its latest report on Empire trade because
Australia has no means of assessing the
value of its imports in pre-war terms. Import
trade statistics are not altogether reliable
at the best of times, but they ought to have
some sort of comparative basis, and they
ought to be issued at intervals of not less
than a month. In Maoriland, where the
figures of imports and exports are published
monthly, credit control is very largely based
upon them, with the result that the Dominion
has only once or twice in the last 16 years
been caught without enough shot in its locker
to pay its foreign interest bill.
Victoria was the centre of the crash of
the ’nineties, and George Turner cut down
public expenditure remorselessly. State and
Federal Treasurers to-
day might cut down
expenditure One-half
and leave Australia
still burdened with its
overseas troubles.
The woes of 1930
have arisen be-
cause external loans
stopped. Annual ex-
ports have a chronic
habit of being
from £25,000,000 to
£50,000,000 short, and
the position so far has
tended to become
worse instead of bet-
ter, which is the pro-
blem which over-
shadows all others
and embodies all
others. The question
may be asked
what Turner would do
with the situation if
he was Prime Minis-
ter and at his best in
1930. It is also a
question whether Julius Caesar would have
made a better of job of Waterloo than
Napoleon did.
Vic. Parliament resumes this afternoon
(April 2) after a recess of a little more
than three months. Money is wanted to
mitigate unemployment, and as loans have
been cut down it is proposed to get more
revenue by adding 4.4 d. in the £ to income
tax on incomes under £2OOO and B.Bd. over
£2OOO. • As the minimum taxable amount is
£2Ol and as there is an exemption of ioU
for wife and every child under 16, Labor s
principal supporters will not be touched-
Non-Labor parties in both Houses will
object and advocate a stamp duty on all
salaries and wages and, perhaps, a small
percentage on income-tax assessments. An
Unemployment Insurance Bill is also ready
for the mill.
Apparently some of those Maitland miners
have got it into their heads that they can
go on being martyrs indefinitely; and they
can’t. The Bulletin once knew a man
who was knocked down in the street by a
motor-car. It w T as the driver’s fault, and
the man who ivas knocked down got so
much sympathy that he decided to stay where
he was, in the road, and make everybody
walk or drive round him. It wasn’t long
before he got quite unpopular—far more
unpopular, than the driver who had knocked
him down. In fact, that person was com-
pletely forgotten.
The Municipal Tramways Trust in Adel-
aide and suburbs is attacking at both ends
its recent yearly loss of over £lOO,OOO. The
old penny-section fares had a 50 p.c. increase
long ago, and have now been put up again
to 2d., 3d. and 4d. for the first three sec-
tions. The Trust also announces, with the
concurrence of all parties concerned, a cut
in salaries over £4OO. It starts with 5 per
cent, on that figure, and works up to a
maximum of 10 p.c. on £475 and over.
Which is quite all right as a stop-gap mea-
sure, though what this country needs to aim
at is an increase of wages through a sub-
stantial increase in output. What is the
proportion of Australian men on wages
and salaries who have been doing their
best and their most during the past seven
years ?
“Whitehall”: The question of America’s
repudiated State debts has been raised in
the House of Lords. Anti-American Eng-
lishmen liaue been harping on the painful
subject ever since Thackeray drew attention
to it in “Roundabout Papers.” The origi-
nal debt was only £15,000,000 (four-fifths
of the sum mentioned by Lord Redesdale
represents interest), and the six defaulters
are all Southern States. The Federal Gov-
ernment would
like to make
them pay, but
has no power
under the Con-
stitution, and
the other States
would not agree
to the taking
over of the
debts by the
Federal Govern-
ment and the
cancelling
of them against
Britain’s debt
payments
to Washington.
Yet it would be
well worth it in
national pres-
tige. At pre-
sent the moment
an American
starts talking
in Paris or
Rome of debt-
evasion • by the
U.S.A.’s Euro-
pean creditors
he is reminded
of what is
always called
“America’s debt
Uncle weeps because he
can’t constitutionally pay
those debts.
to England,” and he can never make it clear
that the debt is owed by sovereign States
and not by the nation.
Chief Sec. Tunnecliffe, who steered the
Unemployment Insurance Bill through the
Vic. Assembly in 1928, will again have
charge of it. In the main, it will be the
same as the one the Council shelved then,
but the maximum contribution per employee
from employers, employees and the State
will be sixpence, instead of the old three-
pence. It will also be competent to authorise
a higher contribution than sixpence if both
Houses agree by resolution. It seems likely
that a fourpenny rate (which would mean a
shilling for each employee from the three
contributors) will be fixed at first. The
fund is to be used to provide _ work, and
sustenance is to be given sparingly when
whole-time or half-time employment can’t
be found.
A survey of Empire trade development
issued by the Imperial Economic Committee,
which compares 1913 figures with those for
1925, 1926 and 1927, shows that Canadian
exports in the three latter years were double
in volume those of 1913. Maoriland was
36 p.c. over 1913 in 1925 and 1926, and
45 p.c. over 1913 in 1927. Australia is at
the tail of the procession—s p.c, under 1913
in 1925, 15 p.c. over in 1926 and 10 p.c.
in 1927. Yet since Australia was the most
furious borrower as well as the most furious
importer, its place should have been at the
head of the procession, not at the tail.
JUST AS IMPORTANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Defence Minister Green refused a request from
the Sydney Cricket Ground trustees and other
bodies for a portion of the Victoria Barracks to
be handed over to them, pointing out that volun-
tary military training was just as important as
cricket.”
Deem not —albeit they have set their faces
’Gainst putting youth, save of its own free-
will,
Through anything resembling martial paces
Or teaching it the elements of drill—
They reckon all parade grounds odious
places,
All mastery of weapons wasted skill;
Strong though their views about disarmament,
They hardly carry them to this extent.
Some well-intentioned pacifists, to stifle
' The Jingo urge, will tell you frank and flat
As an uplifting force the flaming rifle
Is far inferior to the flashing bat,
But worthy Mr. Green displays a trifle
More savvy than to go as far as that.
The art of war he gives an equal place
Beside the game whose brightest star was

SHADOW SHOWS.
The
STATE
THEATRES
SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE
There was a rotten music-hall turn in pre-
movie days, “Only a Jew” by name, which
always scored in east and south-east London.
Managements never hesitated to put it on
though it involved the destruction of fully
15s. worth of crockery at each performance.
They knew that there are always audiences
for uproar. The director of “The Taming
of the Shrew,” which arrived at Sydney St.
James on Saturday, has borne this Show-
man’s maxim in mind. It is about the
noisiest picture—war films not excepted—
that has been screened to date. There are
practically no hushed moments in this all-
shoutie from Hollywood.
The Christopher Sly episode is left out,
the action beginning with a scene between
Bianca and her lover in which it is revealed
that they cannot get married till Katherine
finds a husband. After which Katherine’s
pending arrival is indicated by yells, groans,
a shower of missiles and the descent into the
hall of a fat servant whom she has kicked
downstairs. Mary Pickford’s Katherine
bears no resemblance to Shakspeare’s char-
acter, who begins by being a normal terma-
gant and, as Hazlitt and others have pointed
out, remains dull and unfeminine to the end.
Her Katherine is a psychopathic subject
when first seen—the victim of fits of epilep-
tic rage—and she is never tamed. She over-
hears Petruchio discussing her with his dog,
and it immediately turns her into a World’s
Sweetheart, all arch ways and S.A. The wink
with which she favors Bianca at the family
reunion denotes that in future Petruchio is
to be fooled instead of flogged. An incredible
development.
The soul of the production is Petruchio
Fairbanks, whose over-acting, over-yelling
and over-laughing set the pace for the other
players. The malign effect of his methods
is strikingly evidenced in the wedding scene,
which is ruined so that he may clown through
it without offending the susceptibilities of
Roman Catholics. The nuptial mass is a
registry-office marriage, performed by a comic
curate in a cathedral without a Host. The
’groom’s business with the apple during the
ceremony is vaudeville stuff, and so is that
of the man who gets the core and doesn’t
know what to do with it Very moth-eaten,
too, are the goings-on of the panic-stricken
servant who hides under the furniture, and
has a custard pie thrown in his face. A
good deal of Shakspeare’s dialogue is used,
but apart from the fact that the two prin-
cipals have American accents, the mediaeval
language sounds strangely out of place. No
illusion is created of the leisurely dignity, of
the Renaissance period by these fast-working
mummers in fancy costumes.
The photography is good, the sound-regis-
tration poor, on the whole (the louder Miss
Pickford shrieks the more inaudible she be-
comes), and most of the scenes are effective
—notably the cathedral ones and those in
Petruchio’s house. The programme does not
indicate where the events are occurring, but
in compensation it provides a fine specimen
of unconscious humor with the claim that
director Sam Taylor “has succeeded in
retaining all the humanness which character-
ises Shakspeare’s works, and yet enhanced
the scope of the play” !

“Half Way to Heaven,” a Paramount
release, reached Sydney State Theatre on
Saturday. The stars, Charles Rogers and
Joan Arthur, as the acrobats Ned Lee and
Greta Nelson, have nothing much to do but
look beautiful and behave like nice young
people in love. However, there is scope for
drama in some of the other parts. In par-
ticular, Paul Lukas, the famous Hungarian
who left his native stage recently for a Holly-
JEAN ARTHUR.
wood set, sup-
plies a con-
vincing pi c-
ture of frantic
jealousy. He
is Nick, a
star acrobat
of the Wild
West show
which gives
the story its
back ground,
and he loves
the unrespon-
sive Greta
with terrify-
ing intensity.
He causes the
death of one
of her admir-
ers on the
trapeze and
does his best
to end Ned’s
c a r e e r on
similar lines.
Having been
foiled, he orders Nod to leave the troupe.
They fight, and Ned, though no Dempsey,
gives rather more than he gets before they
are separated. We are next asked to believe
that the homicidal Nick is so cowed that he
leaves in peace, relinquishing Greta to his
rival. It is a sad anti-climax to a well-
worked-up situation.
There is plenty of good, unhealthy excite-
ment about “Half Way to Heaven” in addi-
tion to the fight, which is waged according
to Rafferty rules over a considerable area.
The trapeze scenes, which give the film its
title, are amazing. This picture is of special
interest to Australians since nearly all of
it has been shot out of doors in a light which
is very like ours.

“Wonder of Women,” a new Metro-
Goldwyn film at Sydney Regent, is based
on Sudermann’s “Wife of Stephan Tromliolt.”
It has the novel charm of being un-American
except for the
voices of the
chief perform-
ers. Several of
the scenes
have been shot
in Germany,
and the atmo-
sphere is Teu-
tonic. The
appearance of
Tromliolt, the
composer, on

quite as much

as that of an
underworld
king would
cause on an

of their officials, their delightful ways with
children, and even the dowdiness of some of
their women are recorded, and help to pro-
duce an impression that it is a Continental
film.
As in Sudermann’s book, Stephan is a
martyr to emotional indecision. He always
loves the girl who isn’t there. Naturally,
when he marries a domesticated widow with
three children he soon begins to yearn for
her antithesis, Karen (played by Leila
Hyams), and the bright lights of Berlin,
The screen is the wrong medium for the
development of the ensuing tragedy. It is
unable to say why the women loved weak,
fatuous Stephan; why, having decided to
leave his wife, he bothered to see her again;
and how he came to discover, when too late,
that he had always loved her. This in-
capacity to express fine shades of emotion
is the talkies’ heaviest handicap at present.
They nearly always fail when they turn from
the broad poster work at which they excel
to portraiture. .
Peggy Wood, a brilliant recruit from the
legitimate stage, has the artistry to dress
the part of Tromholt’s wife as such a woman
would have dressed in Germany. Lewis
Stone, on the other hand, as the elderly idol
of musical Berlin, affects the faultless even-
ing wear of a Parisian gigolo. The pantomime
of the silent Germans is magnificent. Alto-
gether, a picture that is well worth seeing.
IToyt’s De Luxe in Melbourne this week
pins its faith in the public’s patience on
“Shanghai Lady.” The piece purports to
be placed in Shanghai, and the present show-
man, who lived there several years, was
surprised at the changes that have taken
place in that city. “Shanghai Lady,” so
the programme proudly asserts, is the first
audible film directed by John S. Robertson,
and if nothing but a declaration of war on
the United States will prevent more of Mr.
Robertson’s dramatic pothooks reaching this
country, there is at least one Australian
who is not too prqud to fight when the call
comes.
Shanghai Lady is an American prostitute
operating in a bawdy house run by a Chinese
hag in the metropolis of “the East.” The
place is resorted to by Chinese and white
men alike (a complete inaccuracy), and the
heroine is befriended by an American convict
who has escaped from a Chinese prison—
another inaccuracy, since Americans are
not subject to Chow law. The hero and
heroine are captured by bandits. An inex-
plicable half-caste pursues the pair and is
in turn pursued by an equally unexplained
Chow of high degree. The Chow bumps the
Eurasian off and the convict marries the girl.
The only asset of Mary Nolan, as the
heroine, is a face which is beautiful when
it is allowed to remain in repose, which isn’t
often. Otherwise she is a snarling, yowling,
raucous caricature even of the class she is
supposed to represent, and if a protesting
deputation from Little Lonsdale-street saw
the Prime Minister about the matter it
would be deserving of public sympathy.
* * *
“Untamed” (M.-G.-M.), at Hoyt’s other
Melbourne house, gives Joan Crawford, known
as Bingo, the opportunity of displaying her
talent for swift emotional changes. Bingo
is the spoilt darling of a drunken father,
who is killed by a scoundrel. She is left
in the hands of Ernest Torrance. He takes
the girl to N’York, and on the voyage Bingo
meets her destiny, Robert Montgomery, here-
inafter to be called Andy. Andy is a candied
hero of the noblest dimensions, but the demon
pride is spoiling his chances. It seems he has
an invincible objection to marrying for money.
During a party at which Bingo proposes to
announce her forthcoming union with Andy
petty jealousies cause a fight. The victorious
Andy will not touch Torrance’s wedding
present of 3000 dollars, and he decides
to escape from the party with a former
inamorata. Whereupon Miss Bingo comes
down the grand central staircase and shoots
him in the collar-bone through her scarf.
Andy takes it very nicely, explaining to
the startled guests that the noise they heard
was an exploding motor-tyre. This convinces
Bingo’s guardian that the young man has
the goods, and he gives him a position in
one of his oilwells.
THE ONLY CROWD THAT DOESN’T COUNT.
THE CHINESE: “But, Missee Jock Garden, if we all-same Mothers, whaffor they do that?”
RED BOSS: “Oh, don’t trouble about that chap! He’s only an Australian.”

The sturdy figure of John Monash will
be missing from the head of the Anzac pro-
cession in Melbourne this year. He lias
asked to be relieved on account of his
strenuous public duties, and as the General
is now Victoria’s leading captain of indus-
try and controls the power centre of the
State the plea is considered a fair one. He
will be waiting at the Cenotaph, however.
Walter Lowry Oakes, a native of Parra-
matta, just dead at 79, was a great-grandson
of John Small, who arrived here with his
wife on H.M.S. Sirius in 1788. Small
was a military officer and an apothecary.
In September, 1789, his wife presented him
with the first white girl born in Australia,
Rebecca Small. Rebecca married
Oakes, sometime a missionary in laniti
who subsequently settled in Australia.
Walter was her grandson.

C. R. Hodge, born at Geelong (Vic.) in 185<

verse.
When James Daniel Connolly began earn-
ing his living as a
bush carpenter in
Queensland, and
presently advanced
to building post
offices in West-
ralian mining set-
tlements, it would
have seemed a fan-
tastic prediction (to
himself or anyone
else) that he would
some day be Agent-
General for Malta
in London. Yet
that is his latest
job. Over 20 years
ago Connolly was a
.Minister in New-
ton Moore’s West-
ralian Government
when Sir Gerald
Strickland was
State Governor, and
the two have been
friends ever since.
Strickland appa-
rently runs Malta

Connolly, having
settled in England,

The death of Tam Mackenzie leaves
three ex-Premiers of Maoriland —Robert
Stout, Wm. Hall-Jones and J. G. Coates.
Tam’s reign lasted from March 28 to July
10, 1012; Hall-Jones had the Premiership
thrust on him when Dick Seddon died
while his lieutenant, Joseph Ward, was
absent in England. In a couple of months
Sirjoe returned and relieved the overburdened
Hall-Jones.
Fatally injured by a passing motor, while
strolling out from his North-terrace club,
Richard Hawker, of the famous South Aus.
pastoralist family. At Bungaree station
he had one of the foremost sheep-studs in
Australia. His Morphettville stud of race-
horses was dispersed only lately, and in 1914
the ground was lent by him as S.A.’s first
military camp. He was a noted game-shot,
S.A.J.C. committeeman for many years, and
president of S.A. Amateur Turf Club from
its foundation.
There is at least one candidate at this
month’s Westralian elections who believes
in the motto that while there’s life there’s
hope. This is Tom Molloy, sometime Mayor
of Perth, who sat for a year or two
(1893-94) in the first Assembly under
responsible government, and has been trying
to get back there ever since. As far as
is known he has never missed a general
election, or even a by-election for any handy
seat that seemed to offer him a chance —it
didn’t matter which House the vacancy was
in—and for fightipg losing contests he holds
a record unapproached in the British Em-
pire. As a wealthy property-owner he can
afford his hobby.
The mulga and the saltbush keep them
tough. Joe Whenan, of Netley station, on
the West Darling, who made a nice dry bit
by furnishing Collins and Pitt street pros-
pectors with horses and vehicles to explore
the Barrier in the Broken Hill boom-days,
came in to his old haunts a week or two ago
to play polo. He is well over 70.
Jimmy Jewell, Ministerial Whip in Vic.
Assembly, has just completed 20 years’ con-
tinuous service in the House as member for
Brunswick. He is just as popular person-
ally as was his predecessor, Frank Anstey,
now Federal Minister for Health. ,
Back in Melbourne, where he was a Uni-
versity student some years ago, Marcel
Luguet, now a professor in France. His
special mission is to study the affinity, whicli
he believes to be a close one, between the
Maori language and sundry island dialects
of the Pacific. Mme. Luguet, who was a
Melbourne girl, accompanies him.
Queer that one of the Brennans should
be Federal Attorney-General at the moment
Dr. Quick leaves the Arbitration Court, of
which he has been a sort of journeyman
judge for eight years. Quick, who had been
a small rouseabout on a' Bendigo mine,
must have been just finishing up his con-
nection with the Bendigo press when the
first of the Brennans was brought in by that
other good R.C., J. G. Edwards, to a small
job on the local “Independent.” Quick went
to Melbourne and the “Age” to be nearer
the law lecturers; and one after the other
the Brennans sought Melbourne and law and
literature too. Quick got off the mark
earlier than the others ; he was only 28 when
a very proud Sandhurst sent him to Parlia-
ment (1880), and if he never quite realised
Sandhurst’s expectations it was largely Sand-
hurst’s own fault. But his services to
Federation ought never to be forgotten ; no
man did more spade work for it than he.
Dead in Adelaide, at 65, Samuel Perry,
a Shropshireman who came to Australia
about 1887, and in Vic. was at the Bray-
brook implement works, and foreman to John
Uanks and Sons. Moving across to S.A.,
he bought out the James Martin Co. at
Gawler, and in Adelaide built up an engin-
eering concern that employed 500 men. His
locomotives are running in nearly all the
States.
The death of Lord Balfour is a reminder
that of Britain’s 10 Prime Ministers dur-
ing the past 50 years five have been Scot-
tish —Rosebery, Balfour, Campbell-Banner-
man, Bonar Law and Ramsay MacDonald.
Gladstone was largely North British, too;
his elder brother was a Scottish baronet
and the family name was originally Gled-
staines. Lloyd George is, of course, Welsh.
Salisbury, Asquith and Baldwin are the
only three Englishmen in the bunch.
“F. J.”: Tom Glassey, of Brisbane, 86,
was mentioned in a recent Bulletin as the
oldest survivor of the first Commonwealth
Parliament. Other foundation Senators who
survive are Josiah Symon (S.A.), now in
his eighty-fourth year; Albert Gould (Syd.),
83; D. M. Charleston (Adel.), 82 next
month; J. G. Drake (Q.), 80; and George
Pearce (W.A.) still in action at 60. Sur-
viving members of the first House of Reps,
include John' Moore Chanter (now of Caul-
field, Vic.), 85; Langdon Bonython, still
active on Adel. “Advertiser” at 82; and F.
W. Bamford (Q.), 81. I am not sure whether
J. C. Stewart (Q.), one of the first Federal
Senators, is alive; if so he is in his 80th
year. There are several others, but they arc
comparative youngsters —like J. W. Kirwan,
60 ; Josiah Thomas, 67 ; and Billy Hughes, 66.
Died suddenly, aged 50, Jimmy Young,
once second-heaviest member of the N.S.W.
Bar—he weighed about 18st. —but of late
years a solicitor: he bought J. W. Abigail’s
practice. Jimmy managed to fall foul of
more judges than almost any other counsel
in Sydney; but his clients had something
to do with that. For instance, he had the
job of defending Percy Brookfield when the
erratic M.L.A. from Broken Hill was charged
with sedition.
Colonel Orames, who takes over the com-
mand of the Salv’army forces, in Northern
China, is an Australian, like his predecessor
LORD BLEDISLOE, Maoriland’s new
Governor-General.
William Mackenzie. He hails from Kyneton
(Vic.), and served as an A.I.F. chaplain
in Egypt and France. During the absence
from Australia of Commissioner Whatmore
on the business that resulted in the deposi-
tion of the late Bramwell Booth, Orames
was left in command of the Salvo forces
in this country.
The Transport Bill before N.S.W. Parlia-
ment threw some limelight on Fred J.
Stewart, president of the Sydney Omnibus
Association. Born at Newcastle, he entered
the railway service as a cleaner in 1900, and
18 years later had climbed to £450 a year.
Then he saw 50 acres of land at Cliullora
going begging, quite near the proposed rail-
way workshops. He bought it, went there to
live, and as head of the local progress
association waited on the Railway Com-
missioners to urge tram extension to the
spot. Refused, and told to mind his job,
he purchased an old Leyland truck with
war injuries and converted it into a “line
of ’buses passing the door.” _ The land
presently netted him £25,000, which was sunk
in more and better ’buses. To-day his turn-
over exceeds £300,000 per annum, and he is
only 45.
Colin Colahan, whose exhibition of pic-
tures is the most-talked-of show Melbourne
has seen for years, started to be a doctor,
but cut away after he had done three years
of it. The Bulletin, which had been print-

ing the young man’s drawings, tried to per-
suade him to finish liis course, and so have
a second string to his fiddle; but he had
fallen under the influence of Meldrum, and
to that great propagandist he still remains
faithful. Colahan went to Paris to study,
was one of the youngest artists to get regu-
larly into the salons, married, and returned
to follow his art in Australia.
“Fleet Street”:—
It was often said that the late Lord Balfour owed
his comparative ineffectiveness in public life to his
inhuman sexlessness. For over half a century he was
as much in the limelight as a king. Indeed, he
was a social and political king, reigning through his
brains, charm and kindliness of nature. He was one
of the greatest catches in the kingdom as either
husband or lover, yet he was never suspected of
wanting to marry anybody, and no breath of scandal
ever so much as fanned him. (His equally brilliant
cousin Lord Hugh Cecil has always had a similar
reputation.) Most men find it hard to live up to
such characters, and tend to choose a leader who is
more like themselves.
Balfour’s sexlessness may have had something to
do with his appalling clothes. For years he disputed
with his cousins the distinction of being the worst-
dressed man in England. Cutler and Hooke, who
were his tailors till they went out of the business
recently, complained that he had not tried a suit
of clothes on since he left Eton. In spite of his
clothes (or perhaps because of them) he had more
doubles than any man in English public life, Lloyd
George excepted. Almost any tall, thin, near-
sighted shambling old gentleman, with a stoop, could
turn himself out to look like Balfour, provided he
was able to grow the necessary hair; and hundreds
did.
He appears as a character in one of Max Beer-
bohm’s short stories. A misfit arrives by mistake
at a frigidly exclusive house party, and Balfour,
alone amongst the guests, goes out of his way to
be friendly to him. He was like that. A press-
man said to me, when S. M. Bruce was last in
London as Prime Minister: “I wish your man
wasn’t so much the gent. He makes me feel a
servant; Balfour always made one feel a friend.”
Let it be his epitaph. It is a beautiful one.
Jack Lewis, the forest ranger of War-
burton (Vic.), who is also champion 50-
mile walker of Australia, averages about
200 miles per week “on the hoof.” He
measures the life of his boots by distance,
not time, just as a motorist his tyres, and
gets “about 3000 miles out of a decent pair.”

Glow of a pipe in the (lark,
Slow steps on the grass;
A face lit up in the arc
Of light as we pass.
Keen, kindly eyes for a space
Searching my own ; a slight

That which lingers in mind
Through lonelier days.

Here was one who could go

SOCIETY
"and it's
printed with
WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Klondike”: The Decalogue, like charity,
covers a multitude of sins. That, at least,
was the belief of a fierce, red-faced, white-
whiskered old Scot who had somehow drifted
into pharmacy and practised in a small Vic.
town. He had invented a rheumatism cure,
and found a ready sale at half a crown a
bottle. Business took him away for a time,
and when he returned he found that the
man over the way was selling an almost
identical article at two shillings. A fiery
interview took place, but McKillem won
hands down. “It’s no against me!” he thun-
dered at his cowering opponent. “Hae ye
no conscience? Ye’ve offended against divine
law and broken the seeventh and eighth Com-
mandments —stealing ma recipe and then
adulterating it!”

“R.T.W.”: During the evacuation from
Gallipoli, as the troops boarded the Mersey
tugs that carried us to the waiting trans-
ports off-shore, an Imperial embarkation
officer stood on the jetty near the gangway
and noted details of units leaving. “W,hat
regiment is this?” he inquired of Bluey and
me, who were about the last of the 19th Bat-
talion to embark. “The 19th,” answered
Bluey. “The 19tli Light Horse?” queried
the E.O. recording the fact in his notebook.
LINE CLEAR.
“So I’m not the sort of fellow you could ever take a fancy to?”
“Not in the least.”
“Good-oh! Now we can have the time of our lives for the rest of the evening.”
“No, sir,” replied Bluey with emphasis as
he thought of what he had on his back. “The
19th Pack Horse.”
* * * *
“Machete”: There is one Australian at
least who is now convinced that his country-
men are lacking in reverence. Not long ago
, fi c wa s elected mayor of a town of some
importance, and, inspired by the example of
the Prince of Wales, resolved to inspect his
dominions in person. During his tour he
came on a party of municipal workmen gath-
ered in a ring. It was in working hours,
but all they were engaged in was alter-
nately lifting their eyes heavenwards and
casting them on the ground again. His
demand from his car as to what they were
doing went unheeded. He walked up to one
of the absorbed ones and tapped him on the
shoulder. “Do you know who I am?” he
said, “I’m the new Mayor.” “Pleased ter
meet yer,” was the reply, “but yer too late ;
ther flamin’ foreman has won all ther
bronzo.”

“Withershins”: Times must be changing,
even in the Land o’ Cakes. Cables describ-
ing the funeral of Earl Balfour at Whitting-
ham in Haddingtonshire describe his aged
sister as being present at the graveside.
This is contrary to age-old practice in Low-
land Scotland, where the womenfolk remain
at home when the funeral procession sets
out for the kirkyard. The departure from
precedent is the more interesting since other
Scottish conventions, such as the conveying
of the coffin to the place of burial in a
farm cart instead of an elaborate hearse,
was adhered to.
* * * *
“Avon” : That it is libellous to emphasise
your own virtues if you do it in a way that
appears to reflect on the morals of somebody
else was the discovery made recently by the
proprietor of a little bootshop in a Welling-
ton (M.L.I suburb. The draper next door
took to selling boots, too, and as the climax
to a war of placards the bootmaker, who
calls his shop the Uno, displaced to the
world the legend, “One man—one wife —one
trade.” A magistrate dismissed the draper’s
claim for damages on a non-suit point, but
when the case came before Chief Justice
Myers on appeal, and the Judge heard that
the draper was separated from his wife, and
that his housekeeper was separated from her
husband, he allowed the appeal. The boot-
maker’s assertion of his marital uprightness
will cost him £5O plus substantial costs.

“T.N.T.”: Old Henry Martin, who had
been a sarnmajor in the days when the Old
Contemptibles were initiating the first hun-
dred thousand of 1914 into the art or crime
of warfare, was inveigled into the smoke-oli
discussion on circumstantial evidence:
whether a man ought to be hanged on it,
and particularly whether he ought to be
able to account for his movements at any
given time on any given day. “I ain’t been
follerin’ the general drift of your debate,”
said Henry magisterially, “but in regard to
halibis there’s generally a flaw somewhere.
I was at a court-martial at Pozieres where
a private in B company of my rig’ment was
charged with bein’ the ringleader in a row
in a hestimanet. ’E swore, an’ ’e ’ad five
witnesses to cobberate ’im, that ’e was at
that very time consultin’ a fortune-teller an’
communin’ with th’ spirits of the departed.
‘Spirits is right,’ says the C. 0., ‘but what
did these ’ere spirits of the departed tell
you?’ ‘Lord Kitchener spoke to me,’ says
the prisoner, ‘an’ ’e tole me ’e wasn’t dead !’ ”

“Strict Veg.”: The announcement that
sundry scientists have been mystified afresh
over the phenomena produced by a new
medium in London reminds me of a female
psychic who fascinated me 25 years ago.
Her achievement was to be stripped naked
and imprisoned in a cabinet with a camera
while her audience sat round her in the dark.
A magnesium ribbon was then fired and the
camera shutter automatically released, and
when the negative was developed the marvel-
lously exact portrait of a statesman, an
actress, a pugilist or some such prominent
personage recently or long dead was invari-
ably revealed. This lady prospered exceed-
ingly for years, and even became the subject
of scientific analysis in a book, and she might
have been flourishing still if a journalist
with an inquisitive eye had not one day
detected in one of the photos something that
looked like an ordinary drawing-pin. In
the subsequent exposure it turned out that
the woman was one of those physiological
curiosities who can swallow and void things
at will. She was in the habit of crumpling
up pictures, bolting them with drawing-pins
wrapped up inside. After she was safely

in her cabinet she brought the package up
and pinned the picture in front of the lens.
When the duped scientists learnt that the
impudent hussy had torn the faces of the
dead out of the front page of old issues of
“La Vie Illustree” they nearly went mad.

“P.X.”: Hunter-street in Sydney rises
quickly after it crosses Pitt-street going east,
and three busy streams of traffic pour them-
selves into it within a hundred yards. Now
it happens that more than half of the daily
papers of Sydney are printed up that way,
and on a recent day a motor-truck was toil-
ing up the hill with a full cargo of unspoiled
newsprint when a rope broke and the
hindmost roll ambled out and began to
make its way back to Pitt-street. It
hadn’t got more than 10 yards when the
second-hindmost roll slid over the edge, and
chased the leader. But by this time the
panting truck, in order to ease the grade,
had turned a foot or two to the right, so the
two rolls didn’t keep the same track, and
neither did the third, which quickly fol-
lowed. At this moment the leading projec-
tile, which weighed 15cwt. and was gaining
speed, threatened to hurl itself broadside on
to a taxi which had poked out of a side
street. The terrified driver, who had never
had to face a situation quite like this before,
stepped on it just in time to find a second
and a third monster careering across his
path. Swerving suddenly he fled at 50 miles
an hour. The avalanches had now got into
the thick of the traffic, and there was a
scatter; but three of them, coming at you
from different angles and at uncertain speeds,
take some evading, and before the things
had calmed down three motor-cars had been
partially wrecked and an uncounted number
of pedestrians had done some of the quickest
dodging of their careers. That paper made
far more stir before it was printed than ever
it will afterwards.
* * * *
“Sol M.”: The “Everingham Millions” get
another mention. Everingham, a policeman,
was allegedly drowned in the Hawkesbury
a century ago, when just about to leave for
England to claim £200,000. Since then no
one has bothered. In fact, so little has any
one bothered that the money, in the absence
of claimants, has accumulated to £11,000,000,
being in the hands of parties of blameless
integrity whose addresses are not given.
Instead' of writing to these trustees a pair
of agents are being sent to England on
behalf of the claimants, whose name is
legion, “to inquire into the possibilities of
bringing the money to Australia.” About
that there can’t be any difficulty once the
money is collected. In the present state of
exchange any bank, would pay for the privi-
lege of sending a few millions to Australia.

“Pliilm”: The Chosen Race will face an
interesting point in Westralia on April 12,
the day of the State elections. Previously
orthodox Jews who would not desecrate the
Sabbath by putting pencil on paper have
voted in the evening. This year the sinking
of the sun will usher in the important
festival of the Passover, and religious scruples

“Peter”: “Gentlemen of Ballarat and
savages of Bungaree,” the audacious preface
to a speech delivered by “Mint Sauce” Jones
40-odd years ago, was revived in the Golden
City the other day. Another Jones (John
Percy), Minister for Works, went to the
provincial centre to inquire into a proposal
that a slice of Bungaree should be lopped
off that shire and tacked on to Ballarat.
“This is the position in a nutshell,” said one
member of the deputation—“the savages of
Bungaree want to become gentlemen. of
Ballarat.”

“Wang”: The Prohibition cause got an
unexpected jolt the other day during the
hearing of a charge of assault brought by a
woman against her husband in a Melbourne
suburban court. The lady was in the box
and seemed unwilling to give evidence
against her spouse. She kept reiterating
“He’s a good husband at times.” The
defendant’s solicitor could get little else
from her, and at last remarked sarcastically,
“When he’s sober, I suppose?” To which
he got the startling reply, “No, when he’s
drunk!”
* * * *
“Meteren”: Our queerest case of a.w.l.
en masse was at Port Said when the Orsova,
loaded with troops, anchored 100 yards off-
shore. The Call of the East was loud enough
to send a deputation to the ship’s C.O.
pleading for a few hours ashore. They didn’t
even get a hearing, and to enforce discipline
the C.O. threatened to crime anyone glancing
longingly at the shore clad in anything else
but dungarees. After posting a big picket
around the decks, the officers went below to
dine, confident after their repast they’d still
find the troops hanging over the ship’s rail-
ings. But officers’ mess bugle was the signal
for a general exodus. The crew provided the
knotted ropes, and slung them over the stern,
the picket promptly lost itself, and half the
bumboat crews of Port Said fought to get
their craft under the ropes. The vacant look
of the decks an hour later spoilt the taste of
the C.O.’s after-dinner cigar. There wasn’t
a bugler to sound a tattoo; anyway, only the
picket and cot cases in hospital would have
heard it. Meanwhile, the folk of the Port
gazed open-mouthed at the invasion of wild
men in dungarees thronging their boulevardes
and overflowing their boozers. It was a wild
night, and the ship’s complement re-embark:d
in state. The C.O. and his staff formed a
guard of honor at the top of the steps, but
short of turning the whole ship into a float-
ing clink there wasn’t much they could do
except look disgusted. We heard no more of it.

And one, of course, a blushing maid;
The trysting-place some scented lane,
Or sylvan and secluded glade
Where once again shall be retold
The tale that never yet grew old.
Yet it may be old friends estranged
Who’ll meet there at the chosen spot
In order that the hour arranged
May see their quarrel clean forgot.
Or crooks who plan some outrage fell —
How in the dickens can one tell?
Yet teasing fancy will not rest;
Stirred by such haunting words as these
How many the solutions guessed !
Well, have it any way you please.

Why B.F. goes to meet A.O.

“Jack Point” : The bloke who “prats his
frame in” is common in all walks of life.
One bobbed up in Boggo-road gaol on a
day that Jim Stopford (then Home Secre-
tary) was making an inspection. He poured
out a hard-luck story, and wound up with
an assurance that once he got out he was
out for good, and what about Jim reducing
the a bit? “When does he go
out?” Stopford asked the Gomptroller-
Gdneral, who accompanied him, and was told
a date about six months hence. “And at
what hour will he be released?” “At noon.”
“Well, let him out at six in the morning,”
replied the Home Sec. magnanimously.

“Sister” : Chin Kitz was cook to Thursday
Island hospital. I paid a tribute to his
cooking, but the bone of contention was as
to the cleanliness of his cupboards. When I
got engaged to be married, he became cross,
and said, “Wliat for? You got good job,”
his final plea being, “You mallied, who look-
see crean cupboard?” Six weeks after the
event Chin Kitz, dressed in pearl grey silk,
came to call. He handed in his card—deep
red, and nearly a foot square—and a jar of
ginger. Conversation having languished, I
suggested that he might like to see my
kitchen. He would. He opened every cup-
board and thoroughly inspected them. I
trembled lest they shouldn’t pass muster.
When he pronounced them “Quite crean,” I

“An’ believe me, kid, I always keep my
word.”
“Huh! I suppose nobody else will take it.”
breathed freely again. When we sailed
for the war, Chin came to see us
off. his parting gift being a gorgeous iced
cake with hordes of tiny green men stabbing
tiny pink ones. Six years later, returning
one evening to my cottage at Rose Bay, 1
saw a Chinese sitting on the top step with
a big parcel in his arms. It was my old
friend Chin Kitz on his way back to the
island after a trip to China to see his wives
and children. Someone on the island had
told him where I lived and he had been out
five times when no one was home. This
was his last lap, as his ship sailed at sun-
set. He had come to see that I and Missie
Baba had plenty to eat, and had brought us
a “plesent” of three beautiful brass bowls
lined with turquoise lustre. It was oim of
the very few good and kind things that had
come to me since the war. It broke me up.

“Spadassin”: That scholarly note on the
proper use of the knife (B. 12/3/’3O) is cor-
roborated by a recent Sydney case which
showed that the weapon was inserted in the
antagonist with an upward disembowelling
movement as your expert advises. Ihe
heresies of the stage and film irritate me.
Invariably they show the blow being made
with the knife pointing downwards in the
hand, and not point upwards as the con-
ventions demand. A notable exception, how-
ever, prevailed in the Middle Ages under
special circumstances, when the practitioner
was on friendly terms with the subject.
With this method one threw an arm affec-
tionately round the patient’s neck and
pressed the weapon down inside the collar-
bone from behind. This method had the
great advantage of enabling the operator
to find out first whether the victim was
wearing a shirt of proof.

“Habbakuk”: America, where such hap-
penings may take place at any time, is
paying perfunctory attention to Judge
Rutherford, who recently
failed in an attempt to
float a limited liability
co. to locate and recover
the wreck of the Ark on
Mt. Ararat. This eminent
jurist has now made over
a £15,000 mansion for
the use and benefit of
all the Hebrew kings and
prophets mentioned in
the 11th chapter of the
Epistle to the Hebrews.
r Fhe estate is to be handed
over to them whenever
they happen to put in an
appearance, and as King
David is one of them it
may be presumed that
local feminine society is
in an agreeable flutter.
“Dohore”: I presented my Papuan cook-
boy Iloari with Minus’s picture of an abo.
girl, supplement to the Christmas Bulletin.
Ilis sleepy eyes brightened and he asked
eagerly, “What name belong her?” “Mainly,”
I replied, not liking to let him down. With
great pride he carried the picture to his
room, where he carefully tattooed the face
with indelible pencil. Then he fastened tin;
picture above his sleeping mat, surrounded
by a frame composed of dogs’ teeth and red
berries. She has been a continual inspiration
to him and has added zest to liis days, also
to mine, for instead of a lazy and unwilling
slave I have a first-class boy who lives in
an enraptured hope that the lady of his
dreams will one day come to Papua.

“A. 0.” : “Lex” (B. 26/3/’3Q) slips regard-
ing the death sentence. It is incorrect to
say that tw r o London city aldermen or
t K.C. in an Assize Court can pass
the death sentence. True, the City of
London Court and the Quarter Sessions
are presided over by aldermen and a
King's Counsel respectively, but the Assizes
are always tried by a King’s Bench Judge on
circuit. One of these Judges also presides
at the new “Old Bailey” (the Central Crimi-
nal Court), which is a very different tribunal
from the City of London Court. Inci-
dentally, the differences between English and
Australian judicial practice are many and
confusing, owing mainly to a similarity in
nomenclature for different things. For in-
stance, “Quarter Sessions” here is a much
more imposing (and powerful) affair than
the English Quarter Sessions, conducted
by King’s Counsel, whoso maximum powers
of sentence are in the range of three years’
“penal.” As for titles, a mere County Court
(non-criminal) Judge is “Your Honor” in
England, while the Judges of the King’s
Bench, Chancery and other divisions are
“My Lord,” although they are not peers
except by accident, as in the case of Lord
Coleridge, son of an ex-Lord Chief Justice.
There are many archaic survivals and
apparent anachronisms in English law. but
with it all England is not so indiscriminate
with its death penalty as “Lex” affirms.
Neither do many people who have witnessed
the assumption of the black cap by a Judge
and the passing of the grimly worded sen-
tence speak lightly of it as “foolery.”
THE FITTING FEAT.
EFFIE: “ Dreadful feet, aren’t they? What size do you take?”
ELSIE: “Well, fours are my size, but as fives feel so much more comfy I always wear
sixes.”
“Toggle”: It happened before netting-
fences replaced shepherds, and in the old
days many of the shepherds were High-
landers. An awe-inspiring race they were —
tall, bearded men, with a dour dignity of
their own and strict canons of etiquette.
Three of the old fellows having foregathered
at the homestead, the boss called them in
for a nip. In unctuous silence the good
Scotch liq.uor slid home. Then Highlander
No. 1 opened his mouth and made a little
speech. “That,” he said solemnly, “will be
the best whisky she has tasted for never-
more.” No. 2 chimed in. “Nayther did I,”
he assured his host politely. No. 3 took
up the parable. “So did I,” he intoned
reverently. And the three stately old men
bowed and withdrew.

“Voltmeter”: The vicar of a small N.S.W.
town had been annoyed by some of his
flock bringing their dogs to church with
them. The animals would stroll in, scratch
themselves into a state of coma, and begin
to have exciting dreams in the middle of
the sermon. One ill-tempered Pom. was
a particular nuisance, but his lady-owner
said, “Really, Vicar, little Fifi is far too
fond of church to stay away. She will
come.” A hint about chains was met with
an indignant refusal. Next Sunday, by either
accident or design, the vicar’s champion
bull-pup was at church. He had his own
ideas about the right of dogs to invade
sacred edifices, and the first lesson was
punctuated by sounds that indicated he was
well on the job. Fifi’s mistress had to carry
home wliat was left of her pet, and consoled
herself with a marble tombstone.

“Feng-Shui”: My personal impressions of
the Christianity the Soviet is said to be
stamping out in Russia were that it was little
above the fetichism, animism and magic of
the Dyaks. The village witch, liable to be
burned on occasion, had more power than the
“popes,” or orthodox clergy. The “popes”
were universally despised, were frequently
dirty and usually illiterate. Men and women
were segregated in the churches, and they wor-
shipped the relics of saints, which as often
as not were bullock bones. The apocalyptic
belief in the end of the world was always
cropping up, and was liable to result in
mass suicides.

“Melo”: History repeats itself curiously
or perhaps learns how to do so. The other
day in Sydney a man brought off several
successful cheque forgeries, the account
operated on being that of a city solicitor.
His system was simple. He gave the man
of law a small cheque to finance some busi-
ness. Deciding later to call the deal off, he
obtained a cheque from the solicitor less
the costs, but bearing the signature he wished
to forge. Fifty years ago, a melodrama, only
second to the “Silver King” in popularity
and still drawing houses, was based on the
career of a criminal who followed the
methods of the Sydney forger. “Jim the
Penman” has had many imitators.

“Mill”: Observing something strange about
the history book from which N.S.W. students
this year have to swot, I took a second look.
The strangeness was accountable for the fact
that the book is an American production.
It is Robinson’s “Media?val and Modern
Times” (Revised 1926), and each buyer is
slugged to the extent of 13s. 6d. for it.
The thing is written from the American
standpoint, and is spelled according to
Uncle Sam. Why our young idea has to
take its history from the Land of Dope and
Gory is one of those things no fellow can
understand.
* * * *
“Whitehall” on an American litterateur:
Gaston Means, the ex-convict who has dictated a
best-seller about the allegedly infamous private life
of President Harding, is the only bona fide German
spy I ever met. He was in London organising a
“Peace Society,” and Proest, the detective, intro-
duced me to him in the Cafe Royal bar just before
he was deported. An illiterate little Polish Jew, he
was regarded by the London police as the most in-
teresting and impudent malefactor in the world ; he
was general superintendent of the Burns Detective
Agency (which was practically a U.S. Government
department) at a time when he was known by Scot-
land Yard to have committed most of the crimes in
the calendar.
Before America came into the war the Germans
were anxious to prove that Britain was breaking
neutrality laws. The Burns Agency provided the
evidence (tug-boat captains were bribed to swear
they had delivered forbidden goods to British ships),
and the Agency even arrested a few simpletons who
were on their way to allied vessels with contraband
for which Agency agents had told them they would
be paid. When the Justice Department discovered
that its employee, Means, was also employed by the
Hamburg-American Steamship Co. in this business on
behalf of Germany, he was “ditched,” and shortly
afterwards he was convicted of burgling the offices of
a firm of New York lawyers.
It is significant that America should be interested
iii the revelations of ex-convicts who are almost in-
variably malignant liars. “Chicago May,” who, like
Means, was better known at Scotland Yard than she
was in most of the U.S. State Justice departments,
dictated a book of libellous memoirs shortly before
she died, which had an enormous sale.

“L.F.M.” : When McSwizzler’s missus went
away for a holiday to her ma he celebrated
to such an extent that for the first couple
of hours the next morning he was afraid
he was going to die, and for the next couple
he. was apprehensive that he wasn’t. Although
lie had an appalling head and dreadful
things appeared to be happening inside him,
he had sense enough to know that he’d, have
to eat. He recoiled in horror before the cold
porridge in the safe, and commandeer-
ing the youth from next door entreated
him to take a couplerbob and bring
back a bit of poultry. He couldn’t look at
anything else. “Stick it on that plate,” he
groaned to the lad on his return, and, after
completing the soaking of his head under
the kitchen tap, he advanced to the table.
There, shining in all its oil, were two halves
of a mutton-bird! MeSwizzle just managed
to reach the back yard before his internal
volcano erupted.
* * * *
“Penfield”: It would be interesting to get
an inventory of the trifles that have left
Australia during the past few weeks in the
luggage of oversea travellers who haven’t
been able to persuade the banks to let them
have as much money as they wanted. At
ordinary times all one had to do was to
lodge his money at any bank in Australia
and for a small commission it would be
made available whenever he wanted it
within, say, 12 months and practically any-
where. But the banks have been strictly
“rationing credit,” as they call it, and one
well-gilded person who asked his bank to
“establish a credit” of £2OOO on the other
side was told he could have £4O a month —
no more. Some early birds carried off wads
of Australian notes, only to find that'banks
abroad would no longer cash them ; and the
bottom fell out of that plan when money-
changers in" London —nearly all sharks —
offered 14s. for the 20s. note. To provide
themselves with a few pounds more than
the banks would let them have, later way-
farers have been picking up all sorts of
odds and ends —old family jewellery especi-
ally. One lately carried off an old barometer
and a watch that had been brought to
Australia by the family a hundred years
ago. Heaven only knows what these things
will fetch on the other side ; but they have
been regarded as lumber on this side, and
they don’t take much room in a suitcase.

“F.S.” : Of the rivers that meander through
the capitals of Australia the Yarra has known
the most bridges. The present Prince’s
Bridge is the third on its site, and so is the
one at Queen-street. The Church-street
bridge is the second, and, of course, the new
Spencer-street bridge is the first. Then there
is the railway bridge, and out at Hawthorn
(which is part of Greater Melbourne) an
old span and a temporary one side by side.
Twelve bridges have been flung across that
part of the Yarra which winds its way
through the metropolitan area.
❖ ❖ ❖ He
“Brimstone” : Let “C.C.” lay about him as
he will (B. 19/3/’3O), there’s still a chunk
of the concrete in our modern hymns. The
verse he quotes is mere milk and water
beside the terrible imagery of the “Hies
Irae,” still sung at certain seasons in the
Church of England and, for aught I know to
the contrary, in others. It is credited with
being almost as old as Christianity itself,
and no youngster who has once heard it
sung is ever likely to forget in after life:
That day of wrath, that dreadful day
When Heaven and Earth shall pass away,
And, shrivelling like a parched scroll,
The burning heavens asunder roll.
One thing at least I hold to Wilde’s credit
is his splendid sonnet of protest “On Hear-
ing the ‘Hies Irae ’ Sung in Church.”
DAMNING CHICAGO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Chicago is the stronghold of Big Bill Thompson,
beer barons, racketeers, bootleggers, alcohol cookers
and mass-scale killers. In 1928 the city averaged a
murder a day. And the cause of it? Prohibition.”
—Final yell of the Vic. “Vote No” party.
Dibbs damned the city once—but that, you
know,
Was pretty nearly forty years ago.
Just why he damned Chicago and for what
Some never learned and more have clean
forgot.
Yet even Dibbs, with all his prejudice,
Would scarce have doomed it to such fate
as this.
There Big Bill Thompson sits in civic state
Exuding venom and consumed with hate
For all things English, whilst in civic war
Daily the gangsters’ automatics roar,
And caution captains of finance debars
From shifting specie, save in armored cars.
There, where the Demon Rum one victim
bore
Gravewards, the Arch-Field Hooch takes
three or four;
And man his fellow-man is wont to slay
At the excessive rate of one a day,
A figure which, it isn't strange to learn,
Occasions sociologists concern.
Chicago, with a thousand marvels crammed,
Dibbs damned you once and now again
you’re damned.
O bitter cup! O ignominy ample l
Paraded as a Horrible Example
Of ills that anti-liquor laws beget
By those who aim to keep Victoria wet.

The new Gregan McMahon subscription
venture at Melbourne Bijou opened with a
thoroughly engaging performance of a thor-
oughly engaging comedy by Maugham. In
“The Circle” the modern Congreve has writ-
ten three well-sustained acts in his most
cynical and brilliant style. On the only occa-
sion when he allows himself to be sentimen-
tal he is pulling the audience’s leg, though
the remarks he puts into the mouth of one
of the characters concerning the romantic
life of a rubber planter in the F.M.S. sug-
gest the Cockney tourist rather than the
seasoned man of the world. “The Circle”
is such a highly-polished piece of theatrical
legerdemain that the spectator easily forgets
that the playwright is juggling the old stereo-
types.
The interests of Mr. Arnold Champion-
Cheney, M.P., are equally divided between
antique furniture and a public career.
Ilis young wife has fallen in love with
a rubber planter who has the cave-
man attributes her husband conspicuously
lacks. Mr. Cheney’s mother provided
the scandal of her epoch 30 years be-
fore by clearing out with an Under-Secre-
tary of State. Her son’s most poignant
memory of his youth was a popular ditty
anent the morals of his errant but lovely dam
which the whole of England sang. The play
opens with a house party to which his wife
has insisted on inviting the now aged lady
and her paramour. Cheney’s father, a philo-
sophic stoic who has refused to divorce his
spouse, unexpectedly arrives. It turns out
that the ancient romance has run on the
rocks. The beautiful Lady Kitty has degen-
erated into a frivolous old hag frantically
opposing the ravages of time with lipstick
and powder-puff. The lover has become a
querulous old man. This deplorable example
causes young Mrs. Cheney to hesitate, and
when her husband displays unsuspected gal-
lantry by offering to let her go, allowing
her to divorce him with £2OOO a year and
arranging to provide her with grounds for
a divorce, she almost capitulates. The planter,
however, brings to bear his enchanting cave-
man arguments, and she decides to go. It
ANN DAVIS, acting finely with Faversham at Sydney Royal.
transpires that Mr. Cheney’s generosity was
a prearranged plot. The moral is that
young blood never learns by the experience
of other people, which is the reason why
history always repeats itself.
Compton Coutts’s vain and foolish Par-
liamentarian was a sharp piece of por-
traiture, in that invaluable comedian’s best
staccato style. Edith Bell was his very
appealing wife. Her lover, the rubber
planter, gawkily done by Russel Gourlay,
roused less enthusiasm. Gregan McMahon
was that rare circumstance, an actor who
really looks, talks, dresses and behaves like
the debonair old gentleman the dramatist
intended him to be. It required an effort of
the imagination to accept the shrill virago
presented by Betty Rae, late of Melbourne
Repertory, as the beauteous society queen of
former days, but the lady is too much of
an artist to indulge the popular vice of com-
promise. Harold Harwood was excellent as
the aged Lothario concerned about the fit of
his false teeth. The performance will be
repeated this evening, and deserves the atten-
tion of the discriminating.
* * *
Miss liunter-Watts’s portrayal of the mad
Ophelia at Melbourne King’s last week
evoked much laughter, but this was less
a reflection on a sincere actress’s performance
than a revelation of the increasing flippancy
of a section of the theatregoing populace.
At the close of Allan Wilkie’s previous sea-
son the “Argus” devoted a leader to explain-
ing why it was a failure, and came to the
conclusion that the Bard was hopelessly
outmoded and no longer fit for stage pre-
sentation. Wilkie disproved the journal’s
argument by staging “Hamlet” to the com-
plete satisfaction of all of a large audience
except the aforementioned section. Arthur
Keane has been a tower of strength to the
Shakspeareans. He is a pastmaster at Eliza-
bethan Stiffy-and-Moism, and he can strike
a deeper note when necessary. His Polonius
was excellent.
Allan Wilkie confessed to being as stag-
gered as anybody else over the success of
his season, and after the curtain went down
on “Much Ado” he told the house that if
he had foreseen it he would have arranged
for a longer stay. Wilkie’s brilliant achieve-
ment is the secret envy of other entre-
preneurs who have gone over to the talkies,
not so much for the money he is making as
for the social prestige they have lost. Theatre
proprietors who were household words in
the city when they were wedded to legit,
have sunk into complete oblivion now that
they have become mere indent agents for
discs of celluloid. Tons of money is a
poor substitute for social tonnage.
* * *
Haddon Chambers, The Bulletin’s first
London correspondent and described in
the programme as Australia’s Greatest
International Dramatist, is responsible for
“Passers By,” a social comedy put on by
Beresford Fowler at the Queen’s Hall, Mel-
bourne, last week. The uninteresting per-
formance may have libelled Mr. Chambers,
but the piece seemed very dull and there
was internal evi-
dence to show that
it was written long
ago, and that it
could never have
been very fresh.
Bruce Hender-
son gave a render-
ing that was good
in spots of Peter
Waverton, an en-
gaged young man,
whose Past, plus
child, comes to
visit him in his flat
during a London fog.
Florence Cheers as
the Past was dole-
ful but convincing,
and Adrian Hen-
derson as her child
was doleful and
unconvincing, like
most too-juvenile
intrusions on the
stage. In the end
the young man
married his Past.
Beresford Fowler
provided one of the
bright things in
the play. He was
a cabman and his
name was Nighty.
One judges that
Mr. .Chambers per-
petrated that one
before the word
acquired its modern
significance.
* H-
The folk who
thronged the hall
of Sydney Con. on
Saturday afternoon
were compensated
for the loss of the
bright sunshine
they left outside
by a very bright performance of Liszt’s
E flat Concerto, with Isidor Goodman
at the piano and Dr. Orchard conduct-
ing the orchestra. Mr. Goodman is a sound
musician and a clever technician, and he
deserved a little better orchestral support
than he got. In the frenzy of the charac-
teristic Lisztian finale the background of
strings and wind forgot that it was a back-
ground and became the whole landscape. The
Abbe himself couldn’t have weathered the
storm and Mr. Goodman was spurlos
versunkt. By request Richard Strauss’s
“Hill Eulenspiegel” fantasia, performed
for the first time in Sydney a few days
previously, was repeated. It improves on
acquaintance, but in parts places a strain
on the imagination that is not relieved by
the fact that the hearer knows the general
intention of the
composer. To these
and other items Dr.
Orchard provided
little verbal pre-
ludes which added
interest to the pro-
ceedings.

The Biggest and
Best Show on
earth found a new
Sydney address for
itself last week. It
blossomed forth at
the Opera House
with the elephants,
bears and horses
prancing on the
boards, old man
Wirth conducting a
•strangely lively
orchestra from the
dress - circle and
good crowds paying
real money to go in
and seeming not
merely willing hut
actually eager to do
so. It is a good
show, brisk enough
despite the difficul-
ties of removing
caged diprotodons
and other massy
performers from
the stage. For one
thing, it deserves
to be specially com-
mended to bushmen
who’ll be down to
inspect the other
biggest show on
earth there’s a
bush girl in it
(from the North
Coast, if this Show r-
man has a memory
for faces) who
handles a horse as
one ought to be handled. Her treat-
ment of a grey that played up on the
opening night was a model of how the thing
ought to be done, though the snectacle of a
young lady in long-skirted evening-dress doing
the handling looked a bit queer.
&
The Adelaide public has responded quite
warmly to the challenge to support the
Royal, on pain of finding it closed, and the
White-Edgley season laughs and dances its
way lustily to success. “So This Is Love”
is thoroughly British, even to subtleties about
Austen Chamberlain; there is one really
clever song about Edgar Wallace, and the
hard-working Clem Dawe gets the last ounce
of effect out of it. He is ably seconded by
Bobby Gordon as an English caricature of
a bustling Yank. Peter Lane and Betty
Eley do the ornamental love-making, and
clever people like Plunkett and Marie
Eaton get small parts only. A jolly show, in
which the placings are, Humor 1, Dancing 2,
Music 3; Voices also ran.

The Jewish version of “King Lear” as
portrayed by the Perth Hebrew Dramatic
Club shows the central figure an atheist of
Jewish, not regal, breeding. Having shared
his possessions among his children, he goes
abroad and comes home later, blind and im-
poverished, to be scorned as a beggar. The
whole play is liberally interspersed with song
and dance numbers and comedy roles, and
is given an ultra-Jewish atmosphere. Shak-
speare, turning in his grave, may console
himself with the thought that the theme
suffers little in comparison with Hollywood
treatment of some of the classics.

“Ambrose Applejohn’s Adventure,” which
Grossmifh made familiar many years ago,
was revived by the Victorian Postal Insti-
tute Dramatic Society at Melbourne King’s
on Saturday. The performance, played to
the accompaniment of the original scenery,
was a moderately good advertisement for the
institute as an incubator of histrionic talent.
Fannie Gargurevitch gave vivacious expres-
sion to the temperament of Anna Valeska
and Irene Wonnacott’s Poppy Faire had
reserve and charm. The quest for the hidden
treasure was persecuted with as much vigor
as a Housewives’ Association heresy hunt,
and Les Bennett, as Mr. Applejohn, overacted.

The people who have been hardest hit by
the talkies are not the city musicians, but
the country town showmen and still more
their audiences. When the silent flicks were
in command it did not matter where those
with a taste for movie entertainment lived.
They could see the best just as well at Woop
as in the city; they even got more for their
money, for the time taken up in city shows
with alleged “presentations” and the like
had to be filled for them with additiona-
film. Now they have to put up with such
feeble silents as are turned out these days,
plus the talkies minus the talk. This latter
infliction has to be suffered before anyone
can have the slightest idea of what it is like.
Players stand and mouth by the mile, and
the whole effect is a slow-motion screening
GLADYS MONCRIEFF, Teresa in “The Maid of the Mountains”
at Melbourne Royal.
of a snail race. Of more than a dozen
movies inspected in a country town over the
last three weeks only one had any entertain-
ing qualities. It was of pre-talkie vintage.
The Palette
Richard McCann’s show at the Beaux
Arts, Collins-street, Melb., is the record of his
European travels. McCann is apt to be con-
tent with colored maps of old-world archi-
tecture, but when he goes after the elusive
jade Atmosphere he frequently catches the
skirts of the lady.
A one-man show by Granville Dunstan,
the Victorian, at the Society of Arts in
Adelaide, shows him remarkable mainly for
versatility. He has vision, composition,
courage. His nudes, whether on the auction
block, or being thrown to Nile crocodiles, or
merely decorative, dominate the show. Yet
he is happy with a bush lagoon, or a
valley at Bega (N.S.W.) or Lome (Vic.).
Vigorous studies of fighting cocks or dancing-
girls round off a remarkable collection.
In his latest exhibition, at Melbourne
Athenaeum, Meldrumite Colin Colahan throws
down the gage to the potboiling fraternity
and their journalistic backers, and the quality
of the challenge is such that it is doubtful
whether there will be any conference of
seconds. If a duel takes places it can be
confidently expected that Colahan will choose
his opponent’s weapon, which is color. The
usual charge against the Meldrum school is
that it paints exclusively with mud, but Cola-
han goes so far as to label a landscape
“Meldrum Gloom,” and it is one of the
freshest and truest bits of color seen by
the present writer for a decade. Intense
vitality expressed with the utmost technical
assurance is this artist’s keynote. Every
square inch of canvas appears to have been
fondled with equal carefulness, yet the
general effect is of a single instantaneous
impression. Two nudes possibly reach high-
water mark in this direction. One is huddled
on a couch, and looks like an insoluble pro-
blem in foreshortening, the other turns a
shapely back to the spectator. The effect of
reality in both is overwhelming. It is
impossible to think of the paint first and the
“personality” of the artist next, as with a
Charles Wheeler or Mclnnes figure. There
is the same simplicity of means and sub-
stantial quality in the landscapes. The South
Pacific has seldom been better painted than
in the view’s of Anglesea with its remarkable
cliffs and great flat beaches; and “Rain
in the Bush” is a poetic fancy, in which
both the poesy and the fantasy are obviously
Nature’s. Each show of Colahan’s is better
than the last one. The latest places him
in the front rank of Australian painters.

This Week’s Investment Tip.
Dividends are being reduced. Cos. which
have paid a steady 10 p.c., with perhaps a
hit better in the fattest years, have sud-
denly dropped their final distributions to,
say, 6 p.c., making 8 p.c. for the year. The
doubt is whether the 6 p.c. or the 8 p.c.
will be the rate for the future. Rarely is
the old 10 p.c. thought even remotely pos-
sible.
Each case, of course, must be judged on
its merits. Nobody can say exactly what
the future of a concern will be, not even
the directors themselves. But where recent
profits have been insufficient or barely suffi-
cient to pay the old rate, an early return
to that rate need not be looked for. Yet
even here one must discriminate. Thus while
turnover has collapsed in some cases other
cos. have seized the opportunity to improve
their overdraft position. “After what the
.Bank of N. S. Wales did,” one managing
director said, “my shareholders will expect
a reduced dividend, so here’s my chance to
work my liabilities down.”
In a large, general way, though, the ques-
tion of dividends is one of earning power.
For the past decade Australia’s real earnings
have not been nearly so much as many people
thought they were. The difference in value
between what we produced and what we
spent was made up by borrowing. This
borrowing having stopped, we are faced with
a reduction in the national turnover.
Spending being restricted, cos. handling
luxury lines will be hit severely. The large
department stores, which are big importers
aie feeling the pinch. But as conditions
improve, and foreign stocks are worked down,
they will be helped by increased production
from local factories, in which most of these
big_ traders are nowadays interested.
Provided the local manufacturer can in-
crease his production efficiently enough, the
present affords an excellent opportunity for
lnm to dig in.
In considering future dividend prospects
these points might be kept in mind:
- HI 1 , 6 digger the recent margin of profit
over dividend, the better the chance of the
old div. being restored, even though it may
have been temporarily reduced.
(2) Little reliance should be placed on
recent profits. They were probably fictitious.
7°ur or bve years or more.
. Beware of the co. with a heavy float-
ing debt. Bank o.d. rates have gone up
and may go higher, and when they are called
m (as many are being called now) sacrifices
are probable.

portion of its capital in bricks and mor-

probably fall, and so may the rents of pre-
mises (if it lets off”), whereas mortgage

Tlie low cost of collecting its income and
managing its investments has made the
M.L.C. a prominent front-ranker amongst
Australian life offices. Income has grown
steadily from £919,388 in 1919 to £2,783,557
last year, when the spring was £67,153;
and the balance-sheet totalled £19,363,199 at
Dec. 31. In the Ordinary branch exes, made
off with 12.9 p.c. of last year’s net
premiums as against 12.3 p.c. in the previous
term: the ratios to total income were 7.9
p.c. and 7.5 p.c. respectively. Few, if any,
can show better.
Now consider these figures:—
1919. 1928. 1929.
Policies .. .. 10,407 12,573 11,283
Amount .. .. £2,513,795 £4,139,245 £4,302,641
First premiums .. 88,277 156,149 146,154
Renewal „ .. 767,064 1,017,696 i;076,106
The co. lias been getting amongst the bigger
stuff; the average per policy has stepped up
from £241 to £3Bl over the last decade.
Excluding single premiums (£8205), and
assuming that new business is 10 times
more expensive than old, the cost of putting
last year’s new policies on the books was
54.1 p.c. of the first 12 months’ premiums
as against 83.1 p.c. in the previous term.
The recent stinging increase in taxation
accounts for over 21 p.c. of the cost in
each case; so the business was really
written very cheaply.
Policy-holders need have no fears about
the co.’s ability to maintain handsome
bonuses. Not only has adequate provision
been made to meet the ' next taxation
bill when it arrives, but no less than
£417,051 of other reserves, to which £112,984
was added during the year, had been piled
up at Dec. 31. That was in addition to the
assurance funds, of course.
The net cost of insurance—premiums paid
less cash value of bonuses—is receiving a lot
of consideration these days. One aspect of
this has lately been getting more attention : it
has been realised that by taking bonuses in
cash and using them to pay the premium on
a fresh policy, an assured can considerably
increase the amount of his immediate cover
without extra cost to himself, though should
he live to the date of the office expectancy,
or longer, the gain in the amount of cover
would not then amount to much, if any
thing. Chief risk is that, owing to a pos-
sible contraction in the rate of bonuses,
he might in the future have to pay portion
of the new premium himself; but this risk
is not very great amongst the leading offices.
In the A.W.F. section policy-holders are
in clover. They are getting back in bonuses
more than they are paying each year in
premiums.
Excepting non-profit policies in the Indus-
trial branch (valued on a 34 p.c. basis) the
office assumes that the funds will earn only
3 p.c. Actually they turned in £5 9s. per
cent, last year. And assets are a solid lot:
1928. p.c. 1929. p.c.
Public securities. £15,827,620 84.2 £16,178,302 83.5
Mortgages . . 879,871 4.7 922,901 4.8
Loans on policies 1,288,428 6.9 1,333,797 6.9

etc 442,249 2.3 493,428 2.5

Net assets ..£17,713,131 £18,456,098
*Other than under policies.
They are conservatively valued, too.
In the Industrial department costs were
up a trifle. Still, excluding divs. and special
reservations, exes, took only 27 p.c. of the
year’s income. The £115.930 added to the
Assurance fund (£3,205,475) raised it to
£76,730 in excess of the liabilities under
policies.
Participating policy-holders now take 85
p.c. of the divisible profits as against 80 p.c.
a few years ago, and more can be expected
in the future. Last year’s remaining 15 p.c.
was £200.000, exactly the amount of the
share capital. No wonder the pound shares
are snapped at £25 whenever a seller can
be located.

Three factors were mainly responsible for
the collapse in profits : idleness on the Mait-
land coalfields, general trade depression, and
heavy investment in new concerns which
have not yet sent along any divs. After
the quarter-million 6 p.c. prefs. were
attended to, the balance of the year’s declared
net earnings was only 3 p.c. on the
£2,000,000 of ord. capital as against 7.4
10, 10.5, 11 and 13.2 p.c. back to 1924. So
the ords. got nothing in the final distribution
and thus had to be content with 2* p.c. for
the year. This reduced the average over the
last three years to 6j p.c.
When the co.’s shipping and coal interests
were passed over to subsidiaries in 1915
£1,050,000 of gift ord. scrip was scattered.
Another half-million of similar paper went
out in 1924. But conditions have changed
greatly since then; taking the decade covered
by the table, average net earnings for the
last half (£174,170) were £73,992 lighter
than the average for the first half.
But Howard Smith’s is a holding concern,
and its position cannot be judged entirely
from those figures. A year ago its chief
interests were as follows:
Howard Last
Issued Smith’s Ord.

S. Blue Metal Quarries 248,000 48,000 Nil
*325,034 6 p.c. prefs. and 866,242 ords.
In addition the co. has a substantial holding
in Australian Sugar (paid capital £207,915),
which has sent out a. steady 12 p.c. for the
last five years. No hint is given as to what
the shipping subsidiary pays, but it is
obviously not the profit-earner that it used
to be. The year’s divs. from coal were
£6632 as against £67,788 in 1928. The Cal-
edonian Co. showed a loss of £54,193 last
year. The holdings in the steel and cement
cos. were added to during the term. Future
agency earnings of this co. should benefit;
but its profits will depend a good deal upon
how the ventures turn out financially.
The book value of shares in other cos.
(£2,930,847, valuation) advanced £248,927
during the year. To do this and spend
£27,460 more than was written off on prop-
erty and plant—a new ship-repair depot
was built —the board went outside for an
extra £197,323 and drew upon liquids for
the rest, as the next comparison shows: —
1924. 1928. 1929.
Liquid assets ..£347.716 £420,711 £287,967
Liabilities . . . . 674,002 664,333 861,656
Excess liabilities ..£326,286 £243,622 £573,689
Thus excess liabilities increased a further
£330,067.
The market, doubtful as to the future,
prices the ords at 17s. 6d. as against 255. 7d.
a year back. At the current figure the
return would be 8 p.c. on a 7 p.c. div. basis.
The backing amounts to 235. sd. in net
assets. The prefs., at 18s., yield 6.6 p.c.
They are covered by £9 4s. in net assets;
and last year’s reduced profit wag over five
times their annual requirements.

With plenty of other people’s money being
scattered, the hunger for things we hadn’t
got grew rapidly during the last decade, and
so did the willingness to borrow to buy
them. Thus the earnings of this Sydney
cash-order mint grew prodigiously. Both
profits and the amount handed out in divs.
have more than doubled since 1919; and
divs. have been sweetened with £182,400 of
gift scrip handed out during the last dozen
years.
The next table reconciles the profits
claimed by the accounts with those shown
above: —

After the prefs. had been handed their £l2OO
the rest of last year’s net earnings was no
less than 20.1 p.c. on average ord. capital,
making the average over the last five years
21.2 p.c.; so the 15 p.c. div. was repeated
with ease.
The purchase of a new George-street free-
hold in 1924 added £lOO,OOO to the book
value of fixed assets, and greatly increased
stocks, but it allowed the co. to handle much
business formerly passed on to other retailers-
Stocks, which are lumped with hire agree-
ments —the two down £24,710 during the
year—are mostly furniture and furnishing
drapery. Business in these lines threatens
to become duller, if not very dull. ■ The
directors give their usual assurance that
“possible depreciation of the co.’s assets lias
been fully provided for”; but that won’t seil
the goods.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:—

Cash, etc. . . . . 274 837 864
The co. is well equipped to stand a knock.
All last year’s spare money was _ put into
Government securities, etc. Including stocks
and hire agreements, the more or less liquid
surplus (£408,225) was £18,280 stronger
than at the close of accounts in 1928.
Latest figures seem to have rather surprised
the market, which had shortened its bid for
the ords. from 545. 6d. a year ago to 325. 6d.
before the publication of the sheet; following
that publication buyers offered 345., with sel-
lers standing off at 40s. Actually there was
no reason to believe that there was any seri-
ous falling away in turnover or profit up to
almost the end of the year. Indeed, the
trouble was that the community hadn’t then
been made to realise that a single thing was
wrong. They are beginning to realise it
now, though.
Allowing for the divs. the return at the
middle price is 8.4 p.c. as long as the 15 p.c.
div. continues. The visible backing amounts
to 295. lid. in net tangibles. The prefs.,
which carry a fixed cumulative 6 p.c. and
have priority as to capital, are priced at
16s-., thus returning 71 p.c. They are cov-
ered by £24 in net tangibles; and the year’s
profit was over 50 times their annual require-
ments.

Since this co. took over the then 19-year-
old McDonnell and East business in 1920,
circumstances have conspired to produce
irregular results. When the post-war slump
hit the soft-goods trade, the co. had to
write down its over-heavy stocks; that was
in 1921-22, and the act was repeated a little
later. Next drought and tight money made
trading difficult. Competition sharpened, as
it usually does under such circumstances, and
has continued keen. Meanwhile extensions
of the premises added to the co.’s problems.
Then, a year ago, both of its founders and
managing directors died; two of their sons,
brought up in the business, have taken the
tiller. .
Last year turnover improved, and gross
profit (£95,854) moved up £4877. But exes.
(£85,108) took all the increase and £3488
besides. Thus, after handing the prefs. their
£750, the balance of the year’s net earnings
fell away to 5.8 p.c. on average ord. capital
compared with 7.8, 6.2, 8.1 and 12-1 p.c.
back to 1926. Because the outlook is very
uncertain no final div. was paid, so the
support for capital was strengthened by
£5375, making it £15,716. It was then
none too substantial.
During the year the overdraft was swollen
by £27,694. Still, there was nothing un-
comfortable about the finances:—

The extra borrowings went largely into
stocks, up £12,509 during the twelvemonth.

Including mortgages and stocks, the more or
less liquid surplus (£68,616) was £6-121
lighter than at the previous balance. Those
cos. which have built up a lively trade on
imported stocks may find it difficult to main-
tain an adequate turnover at payable
prices. Much will depend upon the extent to
which they can get overhead back.
For the pound ords., which have a net tan-
gible backing of 21s. 10d., buyers offer 12s.
9d. as against 14s. 9d. a year ago. It
seems a low price for scrip with this cover;
but these shares have had an average of
only 41 p.c. over the last 10 years, and the
debt is heavy. The return at the current
price is 7.8 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis. There
are 9000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. which rarely
come into the market.
Australian General Investment Trust.
This little Melbourne investment trust
was launched in Dec., 1928, when 100,000
shares of ss. each were offered. A new
issue in Oct. brought paid capital to £35,830
at Dec. 31. For the 12 months to that
date income from investments, etc., was
£2150. Office exes, were kept back to £344,
so the net profit was £lBOO, or 6.3 p.c. on
average capital. Shareholders got a generous
6 p.c. div., leaving only £92 of the declared
net earnings to be carried forward.
That was after charging interest (£150)
against a capital profit of £1069 arising
from changes in investments. From the
balance of this profit the moderate pre-
liminary exes. (£851) were wiped out; thus
the co. starts the current term with an
investment reserve of £69. This reserve-
fund policy is one of the most important
factors in the successful development of
these trust cos. It is mainly to earnings
from the re-investment of surplus profits
that shareholders will have to look for
anything beyond a moderate dividend.
At. the close of accounts the co.’s own
funds were supplemented by £2909 on over-
draft, £1166 of deposits and £162 coming
to sundry creditors. The lot was represented
by investments at cost, £41,123. No sum-
mary of the portfolio is given, but the
directors say the co.’s investments are sound
and widely spread. Still, owing to the slump
in share prices, the market value of the
paper held was below cost at balancing
date, and there has been a steady recession
in prices since. However, this and other
investment trusts are in a position to nurse
their securities so long as they don’t borrow.
But returns from holdings threaten to
become lighter, thus affecting the co.'s
capacity to maintain the 6 p.c. div.
Much will depend upon how soon Aus-
tralia re-adjusts herself to altered circum-
stances. In this respect it has to be remem-
bered that out of post-war conditions grew
a general desire for rapid improvement in
the standard of living. This desire has
refused largely to give way to the claims
of economy, and a change in our state of
mind is a pre-requisite to the restoration of
stable conditions.
Southern Blue Metal Quarries.
This co. has been a disappointment to
shareholders. It was launched in Oct., 1926,
to work a large blue metal deposit near
Moss Vale (N.S.W.) on the main Southern
railway line. The public put up £lOO,OOO,
and the vendor took £65,000 in paids. Pro-
duction began about the end of the first
year, a couple of months ahead of schedule;
the price for metal was then said to be
right and the demand good.
Meanwhile Australian Iron and Steel and
Howard Smith’s became interested, taking
between them about £83,000 worth of scrip.
Thus the total in the share register grew
to £248,000 at Oct. 31 last. The prospectus
spoke of an output of 300,000 tons p.a.
and a 15 p.c. div. in the third year. But
estimates went all awry. Capital outlay,
originally not to exceed £71,000, had reached
£263,634 at the close of last accounts.
Soon after production began unexpectedly
heavy overburden was met with, thus
restricting output and increasing costs.
Then the plant had to be reorganised; also,
additional equipment was installed, the book
value of the main asset being increased by
£49,000-odd during the second year. For
the 12 months to Oct. 31, 1928, the accounts
claimed as net profit £1522, but that was
after capitalising part of the cost of remov-
ing the overburden.
The co. set out on the last term with the
face of the quarry developed, and, a lot
of attention having been given to plant, every-
thing looked right at the producing end. But
trouble was met with again. This time the
old steam shovel failed to do the work
expected of it, and had to be replaced by
a new electric one half-way through the
term. Costs benefited, and the year’s output
improved, but competition sharpened, and
prices eased. Thus, after setting aside some-
thing for depreciation, the board put the net
profit for the 12 months to Oct. 31 last at
only £l9l. And that was after £1073 had
been added to the lease and development
account (£22,421).
During the year £13,965 of fresh capital
was gathered, £6573 Was added to the over-
draft (£25,017) and £4397 to the amount
coming to sundry creditors (£20,718). The
new money went into plant, etc. (£172,363),
up £25,417; freehold (£68,850) remained
unchanged. The more or less liquids (£32,099,
including £11,570 of stocks, etc.) totted up
to £13,635 less than the debt.
With public expenditure cut to the bone,
road-construction severely curtailed and
marked slackness in building operations, the
co.’s prospects are not very rosy.
Lucullus, Ltd.
This is the Melbourne co. which welded
the Victorian interests of Sargents, Ltd., with
those of Australia Hotel Fty.—the latter a
Melbourne concern not to be confounded
with the Australia Hotel Co., Ltd., of Syd-
ney—and a string of cafes run by Metears.
No goodwill figured in the deals. 'Paid capi-
tal is £212,000 in 50,000 ord. 8 p.c. cum.
prefs. and 162,000 ords. The prefs. were
issued for cash, and the ords. in exchange
for net assets. Freeholds figure at £240.000,
and are claimed to be worth over £30,000
more than that; leaseholds, £46,000; plant,
etc., £50,000; stocks, £36,000; cash, £27,000.
Liabilities comprise mortgages, £175,000, and
£12,062 coming to sundry creditors.
The earnings of the respective businesses
are not disclosed, but present profits from
the Australia and Metears’ businesses alone
are said to be sufficient to pay over 10 p.c.
on the issued capital. Thus the annual
P.ref. requirements were covered more than
six times. The net tangible backing amounts
to over £4 for the prefs. and 20s. for the
ords. Both lots of scrip are to be listed.
Incidentally, the price for Sargents’ busi-
ness was £160,000 in 37,000 ords., a 6 p.c.
mortgage for £lOO,OOO and £23,000 cash.
The cash was used to buy pref. shares.
You can get a new view of the wear and
tear and obsolescence of mining machinery
from the fact that in the two years or so since
the direct railway-line was opened Broken
Hill has sent 10,000 tons of old scrap to
the Lithgow and Newcastle steel works. The
Broken Hill Prop, sent 2000 tons last year,
and there is another 5000 tons waiting along
the line of lode. All this is in addition to
the thousands of tons local foundries have
consumed in the past 40 years, and a con-
siderable quantity buried under dumps and
which it would not pay to recover.
* * * *
Old Mt. Morgan's liquidators have asked
the warden for six months’ exemption to
enable them to complete transfer to the new
co., Mt. Morgan, Ltd., and give it time to
make a start. Works-manager A. J. Taylor
told the Court that future processes at the
mine would be decided on results of experi-
ments being made by the American Cyana-
mid Co. These will determine whether lime-
stone is necessary for the treatment of the
ore.
* * # *
Carpathia, the last of the Ardlethan
(N.S.W.) brood, gave it best just before
Christmas, and the mill has been shut down
ever since; in the mine just a little pottering
about is done. The six months showed a
loss of £1642, including an excessive £6BO
for management and consulting engineer.
The co. still has about £4200 put by, so it
can stand a bit of a siege. When work was
knocked off there was a handy lump of ore
going down off what is called the No. 44
South Winze; but it is very costly now to
get out. There is no main hauling-shaft.
* * * *
“Jager”: The old West Coast town of Zee-
han (Tas.) has lost all its glory. Apart from
some small private workings no mines are
operating. But the townsfolk believe the
place will see another era of prosperity, pro-
vided the Tasmanian Government puts its
new up-to-date diamond-drilling plant at
work in the neighborhood. It is thought that
rich fields might be found if only investiga-
tions about Balstrup’s lode and Manganese
Hill were carried out thoroughly. Recently
the local heads put up a great plea for assist-
ance. Local opinion inclines to the belief
that the town is built over a rich lode; the
post-office yard occasionally yields interest-
ing quartz. Years ago the School of Mines,
originally built near the railway station, was
moved into the business centre of the town
nearly a mile away, because a vein of quartz
was discovered beneath its foundation.
* * * $
Braeside silver-lead field, Nor’-Westralia, is
in distress. Some years ago a Government
expert reported that the outcrop was con-
tinuous for miles, and was rich in places. Jock
Thomson, ex-M.L.A., then took a hand and
with State backing did a little digging. He
induced a London crowd headed by Leslie
Urquhart to take an option, but as bore-
hole prospecting was unsatisfactory, Urquhart
and his friends gave up.
The agitation for a gold bonus is spread-
ing in the West. The list of mines that are
just below present pay limit is certainly
impressive. Amongst them are Gt. Fingall,
Lancefield. Yuanmi, Queen Margaret and
Randalls. Also, given a bonus, new capital
will, it is declared, be found for the Nulla-
gine, Big Bell and other low-grade deposits,
which are just unpayable with a pound-an-
ounce subsidy.
* * * *
Having failed to induce London to part
with £lOO,OOO for an interest in the Edna
May Group, Rose Grant, local director, has
decided to bring the treatment plant up to
date. Last year the shares went to 155., but
can now be had for 25., so the time is bad
for a call-making campaign. Grant could
have issued all the reserve shares desired
at 10s., but he aimed high and missed. How-
ever, he provided a good flutter, and he had
a glorious opportunity such as rarely comes
to Westralian mining men these days.
* * * *
Great Boulder and Lake View and Star
tributors are not on the bread-line. During
February they mined 7510 tons for 10,0750 z.
There were many pleasing dividends on set-
tling day.
* * * *
Some of the people interested in Golden
Butterfly, Norseman (W.A.), seem anxious
to get rid of the mine before commencing
treatment. There are 500 tons ore stacked
at surface, and, as there is a crushing plant
within a mile, it is difficult to understand
why the ore has not been put through. The
hauling shaft is being enlarged, but this work
could have waited until the eo. learnt the
grade of the ore at grass. Portion of the
treatment plant sent to the mine months ago
is still on the ground as delivered.
* H* *
Westralia’s latest spectacular gold find
is at Ryansville, near Cue. Rich specimen
stuff and reefs of dazzling appearance are
spoken of; and, according to the local
paper, the field is the best opened up for
many years. But that’s not necessarily
gospel; the same has been said about dozens
of others in the West of which nothing is
heard of nowadays.
* * * *
New Phin Soon, an edifice reared on the
ruins of Phin Soon, a Malay-Siamese open-
cut flotation of some years ago, seems to
have inherited the hoodoo of its predecessor.
Some time ago the two Eastern directors,
Messrs. Marshall (who is also mine manager)
and Garland, recommended the sale of the
leases and machinery to local buyers for £6200.
Sydney directors refused, and instructed the
manager to arrange for six months’ exemp-
tion. He replied that he had rented the
machinery for a year at 300 dollars (Straits)
a month, and had let leases on a 12 p.c.
tribute basis. Sydney has asked the man-
ager to resign hi.s directorship and job, and
he has acquiesced so far as the managership
is concerned. As the Sydney end sees it,
the co. has lost the sub-leases essential to
the mine’s value, but is hanging On to
the leases in the hope of recovering the sub-
leases. A representative is being dispatched
to the seat of war with enough proxies to
enable him to outvote the Eastern share-
holders. Also it is intended to recover a
deposit of £5OOO lodged with an American
dredge building co., and generally attempt
to clean up the mess. The Phin Soon pro-
perty, worked for years by Chinese, was
very rich in patches. In spite of more than
one attempt to reorganise plant and improve
methods, costs have been excessively high
and yardage small, these factors offsetting
the good percentage of ore recovery.
* * « *
Burma Malay has decided to throw in the
towel in connection with its long-drawn-out
dispute over the million-acre Jelai conces-
sion, The co. claimed its title from the
Sultan of _ Pahang in Malaya through cer-
tain agencies. But the British Raj objected,
and when an engineer went on to the area
on behalf of Burma Malay to prospect he
was run in with all his appanage. For a
while it looked as though litigation would
be protracted.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
I read: “£12,000,000 worth of our wool or
other products is sent annually to' pay
interest upon N. S. Wales Government
loans.” As the Government neither grows.
buys, sells nor exports wool, and the squatter
or others who grow or produce the goods do
not hand it over for that purpose, (1) who
sends it to pay interest? (2) How does the
Government liquidate its interest hill? (3)
If we stop importing, will that prevent our
exporting or selling? 5665.
(1) and (2) Smith sends his wool to
Sydney for sale. Brown, of Yorkshire, buys
it. Brown cables to his people that he
wants £5OOO to pay Smith. His people
deposit the money with an English bank. But
instead of sending the money to Australia
the bank looks round to find out if anybody
in Australia wants to pay a debt in Eng-
land. It finds that the N.S.W. Government
is just preparing to pay interest in Eng-
land. Brown’s bank therefore hands Smith’s
money to the N.S.AV. Government’s bank in
England, and the N.S.W. Government pays
Smith in Sydney. Not directly, of course;
but through its bank and Smith’s bank,
though Smith may bo (and almost certainly
will be) entirely ignorant of the proceedings.
This is ■an ordinary exchange operation.
Some that are going through at the present
time are infinitely more complicated. (3)
Exports are paid for with imports, gold or
(temporarily) bonds or other securities.
Britain has been exporting to us for very
many years. She hasn’t taken imports in
full payment—she has largely taien our
lOU’s, with the result that Australia now
owes her about £650,000,000. In our turn,
we can go on exporting without importing
an equivalent amount. Apart from the
interest we should pay with exports, there
is the £650,000,000 of debt to be paid off, and
that can only be paid with exports. And
when we have paid that off—well, we can
lend John Bull a few hundred millions, send-
ing it to him in the form of wool, wheat,
wine, cotton and cotton goods, woollens,
sugar, etc. Many things are far more impro-
bable.
Kindly place in ivhat you think is their
order for a profitable turnover, say, six tin
stocks? —s694.
Stocks worth attention are Ivampong
Lanjut, Kramat, iChangkat, Rawang Conces-
sions (not very long life), Kuala Kampar
and Asam Kumbang. The selections are
based upon (1) ground values, (2) mechani-
cal equipment and costs, (3) financial posi-
tion and general prospects. The future of
the scrip market will, of course, depend
mainly upon prices for the metal, which the
“Wild Cat’’ does not attempt to forecast.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Em: (1) Nobody knows. (2 and 3) The
secretary might possibly place them; there is no
open market. (4) Fair gamble; not for those to
whom safety is very important.... H.C.: Don’t mind
the market; all you are concerned about is the
return. . . .H.J.: Best chance is through the secretary;
no idea of their value, if any. .. . R.J.8.: They will
probably go lower. But they are a very fair invest-
ment ; you are quite likely to lose as much on any-
thing else you might buy.

“Pioneer”: I don’t know whether the
“Scabby” Moffat story culled from your files
of half a century ago (B. 12/3/’3O) was
challenged at the time, but it is a clear case
of a confusion of identity. “Scabby” Moffat,
NON-COMMITTAL.
LANDLADY: “Now don’t you think that chicken was very good, Mr. Meazles?"
BOARDER: “Madame, I know nothing of its morals.”
who owned a Vic. run that was exceptionally
scabby and scrubby even for those days, when
slieep-itcli was common and scrub country
plentiful was Bob. He stood for Parliament,
which gave point to the doggerel your old-time
contributor quoted. The wool king of Hopkins
Hill was John Moffat, who first managed the
place for a Glasgow firm and then became its
owner. John Moffat wasn’t illiterate, though
he did order the “two-ton” library, and his
sheep certainly were not scabby. The ground
plan of the historic hall was calculated on
the required area for reversing a bullock-team
-—a fine generous sort of measure —and the
Duke of Edinburgh had no reason to find
fault with his entertainment there.
* * * *
“Anomy”: Sheeny, a Melbourne lad, tired
of being a draper’s assistant, found his way
to Broken Hill, and got a job in a lamb-
marking camp on one of the river stations.
At the camp fire one evening Sheeny was
telling his cobbers how he would invest his
cheque. “I’ll start a little shop in Menindie,”
he said. “That will be a feather in my cap.
Then when I get on a bit I’ll go on to
Broken Hill and start a business there, and
that will be another feather in my cap.”
“Yairs,” growled the old muster cook, “an’
then you’ll only need one more feather and
you can fly back to Melbourne —thank Gord.’
* * * *
“Ostrich”: Bill and Alf on leave in Lon-
don went to a cookshop that specialised in
herring-roes on toast. Bill took one bite into
his, then gave a large sniff and tendered it
for Alf’s inspection. Alf drew back as from
a dead cow, and Bill, who was noted through-
out the company for his mildness, approached
the proprietor. “ Ere, old man,” lie said in
injured accents. “This ain’t ’arf-rotten
’erring-roe.” “Well,” snarled the busy
caterer, “wodger expect for thrippence?
Petrified whale?”
* * * *
“Eureka”: “My word, Boss, you walk
plurry fas’, mine tinkit,” said Jacky, as be
tried to keep up with the boss on their way
out to do a job in the back paddock. “This
is slow compared to the way I walk when I’m
alone Jacky.” Jacky’s eyes opened. “By
cripes, Boss.” he answered, “I wouldn’t like
walkin’ with you when you walkin’ alone,
then!”
* * * *
“Kadu-weela”: He was sitting propped ;up
in bed —gaunt, dishevelled, despairing-—with
32 machine-gun bullets embedded in his
chest. A huge blundering W.A. drover. His
chief trouble was that lie was to die so
far from home. “If I could just see a
gum-tree I could go happy,” he said. Taking
his hand I explained that I had just arrived
from Australia, and at last he looked up.
“Another of those sisters?” he growled, point-
to the nurses busy about the ward. “Oh
no,” said I. “I’m just an Australian girl.”
“A girl from Australia!” he moaned. “Well,
give us your hand and let’s hold it for a
while.” He gripped my two hands in both
of his horny palms. I asked him if he had
a mother or a sweetheart back there in
W.A. Was there any message for them? He
pondered a moment, then, reaching for his
little treasure-bag, slowly produced a post-
card photograph, and gazed at it lovingly.
“Ain’t she a little beaut.! My God, ain’t she
a prize-winner!” He handed me the card
in a growing silence. It was the photograph of
a pretty girl standing at the door of a shed
with her arm thrown across the back of a
sturdy heifer. “She is charming,” I agreed.
“Would you like me to write her a letter
for -you?” He looked at me for a moment,
befogged. Then he grinned wanly. “That
ain’t my girl,” he said. “I was sliowin’ you
my prize heifer, Buttercup, the best calf ever
weaned in the West.”
A TRADE SECRET.
“’Ow ez it, Cap’n, that little needle do always point one way, an’ ’ee can’t make un
point no other?”
“M’son, it took me five solid ’ear to learn to he a dialler, an’ do ’ee think I’m goin’ tell
’ee in five minutes what took me five ’ear to find out?”
“Y.N.0.”: There’s a gate that isn’t a
gate on the road between Talwood (Q.) and
Garah (N.S.W.). On each side of the opening
is a piece of galvanised-iron with a life-sized
sheep-dog painted on it. The folk of the
district swear they have never known a
sheep to stray through. In fact when moving
sheep from one paddock to another it is
necessary to cover up the pictured sentinels.

“Eureka”: The new Mount Darragh-road
which, when completed shortly,
will connect Southern Monaro
with the N.S.W. South Coast,
will do away with the travellers’
greatest nightmare—Big Jack
Mountain-road, the steepest in
N.S.W. In places the grade is
one in four. Prior to the rail-
way extension from Nimmitabel
to Bombala a big percentage of
the Monaro wool-clip went down
this mountain to the seaboard,
and so steep was the road that
big bushes were tied to the wag-
gons to assist the brakes. One
waggon of wool, together with
the horses, went over the side,
a drop of some hundreds of feet,
and it is a wonder that more
have not suffered the same fate.
It will be a pity, however, if
the Big Jack is closed to traffic,
as the scenery is unsurpassed.
Scented musk, everlasting
daisies, and hundreds of other
bush flowers grow in abundance
right up to the roadside and fill
the cool air with a delightful
fragrance, while rock wallabies,
koalas and bush birds, including
lyre-birds and mountain par-
rots, are to be seen from the
roadside. Another feature of
the Big Jack is the shire main-
tenance man, Johnny Doyle,
who lives half-way up the moun-
tain and is ever ready with a
billy of tea and a bit of damper.

“Jane” : Recently during lamb-marking on
a n.-w. Queensland station a ewe lamb
showed on one ear a perfect replica of the
station tarbrand —a black circle and dot
in the centre. The lamb’s mother was branded
off shears, along with 1800 other ewes, when
about a month in'lamb. Pre-natal influence?
* * * *
“Raja” : Just outside Jamberoo, bordering
the bush track through the Government reserve
on the way to Minnamurra Falls (N.S.W.),
there are some giant stinging-nettle trees
that are shunned like the Devil by every-
one who knows the district. A wily old
she-fox and her brood had taken shelter
among the trees on my approach along the
seldom-used track, and I was about to hunt
her out when hauled back by the Government
ranger. He said that the last chap who went
fossicking there got stung so badly that he
afterwards tried to commit suicide in the pool
below the falls.

Dear Bulletin, — I wish to get some infor-
mation regarding the opossum which I think
the many practical bushmen among your
readers can supply. The matter is of interest
in view of the possibility of conserving these
animals in forest areas for fur purposes.—
Yours, A. S. Le Souef, Director Taronga
Zoo, Sydney.
PARTICULARS WANTED.
(1) What particular tree is the opossum found on
in your district?
(2) In country suitable for opossums, how many
could one reasonably expect to And per acre or per
square mile?
(3) Are opossums found far from water in dry
weather ?
(4) It has been stated that opossums usually make
for trees that happen to be in flower, and may be
concentrated at times in one area, owing to this
attraction. Can you confirm this?
(5) Is the fox an enemy of the opossum?
«s * # St
“Raja”: Whakapuaka (M.L.), better
known as Cable Bay, was a sportsman’s
paradise when I was there in the early part
of the century, and. tended to make gour-
mands of us dot-and-dashers. Crested Cali-
fornian quail strutted about in front of the
office all day long; whitebait in millions
swam up the creek and got mixed with our
water supply; big wonga pigeons flew over-
head, and hares (not rabbits) were all round
us. Big pigs grunted in the Government
reserve less than 100 yards away, and the
red deer simply invited one to shoot them.
I have gathered a kerosene-tin full of the
choicest mushrooms in a few minutes. As
for the fishing-—I dare not tell the truth
about the fishing and continue to live in
Sydney.

■ “FY7”: As one who has been much exposed
to horses since childhood, I should like to
back “Elgie” when he flouts the Remarque
reference to the squealing of wounded horses
(B. 19/3/’3O). Like “Elgie,” I have seen
horses killed in divers fashions, includ-
ing rifle and artillery fire and aerial bombs.
The only time I heard the servant of man
give tongue was at Port Elizabeth during
the Boer War. At that open roadstead some
600 horses had to be slung out of the holds
into barges alongside. Nearly every one of
them as he was heaved high in the air gave
it lip, and a most distressing sound it was.
The regiment on board with them was an
Imperial contingent, most of the personnel
being lifelong horse addicts. All were
astounded at an experience they had never
encountered before;

SHED FANTASY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Men that clamor, dogs that yammer, while
a thousand small hoofs hammer
With a hard, staccato grumble echoing
throughout the shed,
And we’re belting and we’re pelting under-
neath the hot sun melting,
As we curse the stubborn woollies and
the brazen skies o’erhead.
Oh, the hustle and the bustle, as the sweating
shearers tussle
With the jumbucks that keep bucking as
they grip ’em by the ears,
With a striding and a gliding and a slipping
and a sliding,
Half-pushing ’em, half-riding, as they lug
’em to the shears!
Oh, the clicking and the flicking as the bright
machines go snicking,
A-pinking down the belly and a-snipping
round the hams!
Oh, the tearing and the swearing as a clumsy
brute starts rearing!
Oh, the ill-assorted flavors that keep coming
from the rams !
There is sweating and there’s fretting—little
time to think of petting,
Mustn’t let your fancy stray to Sue or
Mary, starve the crows!
There’s a clatter and a scatter, and the
bedlam voices batter
With a force that well may shatter every
picker-up’s repose.
Hear their roars of “Tar, tar, tar! Where
the devil is the tar?
What the blazes!”- “Here you are !
Mind my clothes.”

The New Beale
“Interpretive ” Player
The Beale Company has recently produced two new Player-Piano designs. They
are the proud achievement of many months of patient laboratory and technical
experiments in the Beale Factory.
The Model now featured—the “Interpretive”—is a combination of features found
in the regular Beale Models with those of the magnificent instrument designed
by Mr. Hardy Wilson, the eminent architect.
The encasement is of richly figured Walnut, finished with the Beale Imperishable
Lacquer.
This instrument has a surprising tone volume and range of expression, whether
played manually or operated as a Player.
Musically, constructionally, architecturally, it is one of the finest examples of the
art of piano-building that has ever been attained.
WE INVITE YOU
to critically examine
both the internal and
external structure of the
Beale Player
Have the instrument dis-
mantled before your eyes.
Deliberately inspect the
interior of the instru-
ment at any of the Show-
rooms named below.
Generous terms, with
modest deposit, and the
Company’s Written
Guarantee for 25 years.

“Aramae” : A retired French schoolteacher
in Algeria has written asking “Monsieur Le
Prefet” of Brisbane “to intervene favorably
with his wealthy and influential connections”
so that “deligations and tourists” may bring
living presents of many wild fox-dogs, of a
wolf type, handsome and inoffensive to men
and cattle, to be crossed with other dogs.”
The idea is to get a strain imbued with
“the blood and habits of hot desert, dry,
sandy and vast regions, that will keep down
desert rats, locusts and other vermin.”
The philanthropist ivho set our dingo loose
to catch locusts would get a surprise on the
morning after the first night.

“Larrapinta” : At my bee-ranch at Boobo-
rowie (S.A.) on a recent evening I had a
front-seat view of a typical backblock squall.
The day had been hot and sultry, with big
masses of thunder clouds gathering all day.
Shortly before 5 p.m. the sky cleared to the
west, and then a dark band appeared along the
western horizon. In appearance it resembled
a titanic wave of water, or rather ink, with
overhanging folds like those of a heavy
curtain; in color it was dead black,
with a tinge of red on the crest. It swept

down on me, and in 15 seconds I couldn’t
see my feet. Within a minute I literally
couldn’t see my hand before my face. The
wind howled and roared, small pebbles rattled
over me like hail, and the dust gave one a
sense of suffocation. In half an hour s time
from its first onset the dust cleared, a few
points of liquid mud fell, the wind dropped,
and a very dirty and dust-covered bloke set
to work to clean up a hell of a mess.

“Thomas Pepper”: _ The desert oyster
(Succulentis aridii ) is one of the most
curious creatures
in all this land of
wonders. It is only
to be found to the
sou’-west of the
Musgrave Ranges
.(Central Aus.) and
lives on the sand of
the desert in
exactly the same
way as the sea
oyster lives on the
ocean-bed. Its diet
consists principally
of opal matrix,
though it is not
above making a
meal of gneiss, fel-
spar or orthoclase,
and it obtains its
water from the
juice of the patina
upon outcrops of
copper ore. It
breeds only when a
full moon falls on a
Friday, and when-
ever this happens
the still, warm air
of the desert night
is filled with low
deep vibrant mur-
murs, plaintive
croonings, and wild,
sweet trillings as
the mating call of
tli e oysters is
poured out in a
flood of haunting
melody from a mil-
lion open shells.
These bivalves are
delicious when
fried in melted
diorite, or they can
be eaten raw. They
contain pearls, too,
and I am floating a
company to exploit
this vast and hitherto neglected natural
resource.

“Erua”: In Maoriland lunar rainbows
are not as rare as in less-rainy Australia.
In Auckland, where during the equinoctial
gales tremendous showers come up at regular
intervals, I once saw three in one week, the
moon being near the full at the time. The
lunar bow reproduces faintly the colors of
the sunlight bow, and is a beautiful, opales-
cent arch like a fairy bridge across the
sky, but does not, owing to its faint coloring,
boast a “devil’s imitation,” as does the
ordinary rainbow.

“Bill Y.”: “The most ferociousest snake I
ever seen,” said Joe the bullocky, “was one
that tackled me

Tallandoon. I made
a chop at him with
me whip, and he
sprang into the air
an’ grabbed me

He took a half-
hitch with his tail
round th’ limb of a
wattle and hung on
to me lash like
grim death. He
swallowed th’
cracker like a Mur-
ray cod would a

started on me

him dead to rights

neither go backwards or forrid. So I used
him as a whip from there to Tallangatta.”

“Wollard”: Some of the Speck’s pest
experts suffered headaches recently searching
for means of stopping a plague of Ruther-
glen bugs which commenced to demolish
everything in the greenery line in a Laun-
ceston suburb and invaded the houses.
Fifteen years ago when a similar plague
occurred a ring of tar three-quarters of a
mile in circumference stopped the bugs, but

“Claude W.”: Examination of the cater-
pillar reveals that he breathes with most
parts of his body. Respiration is effected by
means of an immense number of branched
tubes which com-
municate with the
outer air by a
series of apertures.
Along each of its
sides the caterpillar
has a row of dark
spots, and under
the microscope an
aperture covered
over with a mesh
of fine bristles is
discovered in the
centre of each of
these spots. The
mesh is probably
there to keep out
the dust, and these
apertures all along
the body may be
called the nostrils
through which the
caterpillar breathes.
From the apertures
the air is passed
into the breathing
tubes, which
branch through all
parts of the insect’s
body. No matter
how much the
caterpillar may
bend and twist its
body, each tube re-
mains open, for it
is double, one tube
within another, with a strong bristle, coiled
between the two like the spiral wire of
armored hose.
$
“Murkah”: As “Shock” (B. 25/12/’29)
surmises, the prof, was in error regarding
the power of lightning. To bridge a spark-
gap necessitates a pressure of 20,000 volts
per inch, or 1,200.000,000 volts per mile. In
the case of lightning the gap between thunder-
cloud and earth frequently exceeds a mile.
Man can do some astonishing things electri-
cally, but about 5,000,000 —-enough to jump
a 20ft. gap—is the limit of “manufactured”
voltage. Although a lightning flash lasts only
about one-thousandth of. a second, the cur-
rent-flow during that brief period runs into
hundreds of thousands of amperes, and a
conservative calculation indicates 40,000
horse-power as the energy of a mile-long flash.
A fleeting thousandth-sec. is long enough for
that terrific outburst to turn the water con-
tent of a tree into steam. Its bulk is there-
by multiplied by about 2000, which means a
steam-pressure of nearly 15 tons to the inch.
No wonder the tree bursts. Were it encased
in battleship steel the latter would be torn
like wet tissue.

“Nakhoda”; The old-fashioned notion that
the native has the secret of mysterious and
deadly poisons unknown to western medicine
tends to be disproved by the annual ex-
perience of the Malayan medical department.
Of 234 cases of poisoning investigated last
year all but one was brought about by
arsenic, obtained from a vendible ant poison,
from cyanide used in mining operations,
from opium or from powdered glass. The
one exception was produced by a decoction
of the gadong, or wild yam. A British
doctor told me that in 20 years’ experience
he had not come on one Asiatic poison that
was not to be found in the pharmacopoeia.

“Mako”: There’s a saying that crops up
frequently in the Old Testament: “This they
did' that the prophecy might be fulfilled,”
which has evidently appealed to Maori pro-
phet Ratana, an ardent student of the Word.
When he makes a prophecy he does his best
to make it come true. After the building
of his temple he prognosticated great pros-
perity for his followers, and then, to their
disgust, sent them forth to break in virgin
land, and till and sow diligently, with the
result that he got 800 acres of wheat esti-
mated at 40 bushels to the acre.

“Tee Essbie”: I have to report the develop-
ment of a new Australian industry. Calling
on an old market-gardener in a Sydney
suburb, I found him paying a small boy a
shilling for a gross of live vine-bugs. When I
asked why, he explained that it had been his
practice tor years to pinch the flowers off his
potato plants in order to get a better crop.
A couple of seasons ago he found that the
common green vine-bugs were doing the job
for him without hurting other parts of the
plants, or attacking other vegetables. As I
passed along the road on my way home, I
found every urchin on the landscape indus-
triously engaged in hunting bugs at a penny
a dozen.

“Piecrust”: Besides ants keeping cows and
milking them (B. 12/3/’3O) there is a
species, found chiefly in Switzerland, which
has long been studied for its slave-making
propensities. The males and fertile females of
this variety do no work at all, and all the
remaining females do is to catch slaves,
which come from a larger and slower species.
The slaves feed, wash and groom their

When old John Bax drove the mail to Coona-

His reins were made of rawhide, his lash

He’d four grey Walers in his own brown

And we all set our watches when the

His team was all ajathery, but fit and well

With ne’er a gall or whipmark and not
a tender hoof!
It’s long, long years now since Johnnie Bax

Long years ago, before the most of you
were born :
But them were the days it was good to be
alive in,
When the sun kept time by the sound of

The total Commonwealth and State loans
falling due in Australia during the calendar

The amount of £104,375,800 includes Com-
monwealth loans, amounting to £70,000,000,
maturing in March and December, the
balance being largely made up of domestic
loans (such as borrowings from Government
Savings Banks and other semi-Governmental
institutions, etc.). The Commonwealth loans
for £70,000,000 have already been converted
to the extent of £40,000,000.
What type of wireless receiver do you
recommend for use on a small sailing-yacht
cruising in the neighborhood of Brisbane
Water (N.S W.). ?— 5604.
If the installation is to be of a permanent
nature, a 4- or 5-valve battery-operated re-
ceiver, using low filament consumption valves
and a small outdoor aerial attached to the
mast. Otherwise a portable receiver, employ-
ing a frame aerial and built-in speaker, is
recommended.
(1) What are the advantages in radio
of a moving-coil speaker? (2) Gan it be
used icitli an ordinary broadcast receiver? —
5625. . .
(1) It reproduces musical frequencies with
a greater degree of accuracy than most other
types of speakers do, and it will deliver great
volume without distortion. (2) Yes, pro-
vided that the receiver is a high-grade
instrument capable of giving loud volume
on the usual type of speaker.
(1) Where is the Broughton Hall Psychiat-
ric Clinic, Sydney? (2) What wages arc
nurses employed there paid? (3) What
qualifications must applicants for nurse’s
position possess? (4) How long does it take
to travel from Strathfield to the institution
by tram? —5381.
(1) Official address is Mental Hospital,
Leichhardt. (2) Probationers, £167 4s. 4d.;
second year (junior), £177 4s. 4d.; third
year (junior), £l9O 4s. 4d.; fourth year
(senior), £205 4s. 4d. per annum. Progres-
sion is subject to passing nursing exami-
nation and satisfactory service. (3) Appli-
cants must apply personally, and must be
unmarried; under 30 years of age, of good
physique and in good general health; not
less than sft Sin. in height, and of fair
education. (4) About half an hour by train
and tram or ’bus and tram, there being no
direct tram route.
(1) What is the limit of height to which
artesian-bore water will rise into the air
from 10 in. casing? (2) Will water rise
above the surface immediately it is tapped,
or does it have to be started? —5395.
(1) It depends upon physical conditions
in each case; it may be an inch or less or
it may be several feet. (2) If its pressure
is sufficient to cause it to rise above the
top of the casing it will flow of its own
accord almost immediately after being struck.
There is a movement in North Auckland
( M.L .) to establish an agricultural school.
A deputation to the Minister of Education
suggested it should be on the lines of the
N.S.W district rural schools. A dept, official
replied that those schools were not a success.
Is this so? —5265.
No truth in it. The enrolment in schools
of this nature is growing and their popu-
larity is increasing. The practical nature
of the work makes a strong appeal to the
farming community.
I am the purchaser of a War Service home,
and am credited with a sinking fund. How
does it work? Does the purchaser build this
sinking fund up by paying more than his
allotted instalments? For instance, suppos-
ing I were asked to pay £3 per month and
paid £5, would the extra £2 go to the sinking
fund? Is this fund refunded to the pur-
chaser on completion of payment? —s49s.
According to the War Service Homes Act,
“In addition _ to making any payment in
accordance with the contract, the purchaser
or borrower may deposit with the Commis-
sioner any sum not less than £l, and any
sum so deposited shall be credited to the
purchaser or borrower with compound inter-
est calculated yearly at the same rate as
is charged upon the purchase money or
advance.” Any payment made by an appli-
cant in excess of what is due is credited
to the applicant’s sinking fund, and the
deposits therein earn interest at 5 p. c. p.a.
on multiples of £l. Sinking fund eredits
are available for payment of instalments due,
or as an addition to an amount tendered by
an applicant to discharge his total liability.
In the event of an applicant who has an
amount standing to his credit in the sink-
ing fund being unable to pay his usual
monthly instalments, the sinking fund would
be drawn upon to an amount required to
complete the necessary payments, until such
time as the credit therein had been exhausted.
It is not possible for any portion of an
amount standing to an applicant’s credit in
his sinking fund to be refunded to him.
(1) Is there a market for the tusks of
wild pigs? (2) In playing five hundred,
can the joker be used to follow any suit?
(3) How to count in five hundred? —5538.
(1) Slight demand, for making umbrella
handles, etc. (2) With trumps, the joker
is the master trump and no more. With no
trumps the joker becomes the highest card,
when led, of the suit the leader elects it to
represent. The leader of it cannot nominate
it for a suit he lias renounced. If he plays
it —not being the leader —to the lead of a
suit which he has previously renounced, it
has no winning value. (3) Beginning with
spades, a bid of 6 tricks counts 40; clubs,
diamonds, hearts and no trumps increase by
20 at a time. In addition, 100 goes on for
each suit for each additional trick.
Fruit falls from my four-year-old lemon-
trees when about the size of a pigeon's egg.
The trees arc growing vigorously, and no
infestation is visible. Have watered freely
and apjilied lime and ammonium sulphate
in small quantities. How can I save the
fruit ? —5394.
Check the vigor of the tree by using less
stimulant until the fruit is well set freely
over the trees, then apply moisture and fer-
tiliser in moderation. Condition of your
trees does not suggest that lime is required.
Wood ashes would be useful. Ammonium
sulphate applied after a fruiting habit is
developed, at rate of fib. to lib. for each
year of tree’s age—up to 101 b. for an aged
tree—should be ample.
What was the vaudeville specialty of the
late Eugene Stratton, and did he ever appear
in Australia?— s447.
He was a “nigger minstrel,” for years with
the Moore and Burgess troupe at St. James’s
Hall, London, before he went to the music-
halls to exploit songs like “The Whistling
Coon” and Leslie Stuart’s “Lily of Laguna.”
He did not appear in Australia.
What is the law in regard to a dividing
fence? Can my neighbor compel me to erect
a paling fence when I want to erect a wire
0ne? —5548.
Under the Dividing Pences Act (N.S.W.)
the dispute may be referred to the arbitration
of two persons to be mutually chosen by the
parties. If they do not agree the parties
may refer it to an umpire, whose decision
shall be final.
I recently attempted to paper a room,
over wood lining painted some years ago.
Fixed newspaper first then applied wall-
paper. Three of the walls held well; the
other is not a success, the paper cracking
and peeling off. Cause and remedy? —s479.
The walls should have been scrimmed with
hessian or cheese-cloth, as wood expands
and contracts, breaking the paper. Most
satisfactory course would be to re-paper the
room, stripping off the existing paper and
using scrim as a base for the new covering.
(1) Price obtainable for kaolin, Sydney.
(2) Firms interested. (3) Uses? —5235.
(1) Kaolin is a definite mineral com-
posed of hydrated silicate of aluminium
resulting from the alteration of felspar, but
in the trade any white clay which is used
in the manufacture of porcelain is termed
kaolin. The price of such clays ranges from
30s. per ton to £5 or £6 per ton. (2) R.
Fowler, Ltd., Fitzroy-street, Marrickville;
Bakewell Bros., Ltd., Erskiueville; Central
Brick and Tile Co., Albert-street, St. Peters
—all Sydney. (3) In the manufacture of
pottery and cold-water paints and as fillers
or coating materials in making paper, rubber,
oilcloth, textiles, etc.
(1) Is there a market for out-of-season
mushrooms in Sydney? (2) Average yield
per square foot of bed? (3) Average price
obtainable in winter? (4) Publications deal-
ing with mushroom-growing in Australia? —
5311.
(1) Yes. (2) There are no commercial
areas in existence in Australia owing to the
difficulty of obtaining viable spawn. In
other countries the yield ranges from ljlb.
to 241 b. per sq. ft. of bed. (3) Is. per lb.
(4) A leaflet can be obtained from the
N.S.W. Dept, of Agriculture.
What is the definition of (1) Cyclone,
(2) gale, (3) hurricane, (4) monsoon, (5)
tornado? —ss62.
(1) A storm in which the wind has a cir-
cular course, a hurricane or tornado of
limited diameter and destructive violence, or
a system of winds rotating around a centre
of minimum barometric pressure. (2) A wind
of considerable strength. (3) A name given
primarily to the violent windstorms of the
West Indies, which are cyclones. (4) A
seasonal wind prevailing in Southern Asia,
and especially in the Indian Ocean, which
during the period from April to October
blows approximately from the south-west,
and from October to April from the north-
west. N (5) A very violent storm affecting
a limited area in which the wind is con-
stantly changing its direction or rotating;
loosely, any very violent storm of wind or
hurricane.
What is the object of Polar exploration;
what benefit has been derived from it, and
has the knowledge gained warranted the
expenditure and loss of life? —5340.'
Exploration of any sort is primarily the
outcome of an instinct that impels men
to investigate the globe they live on. Polar
exploration, apart from the dramatic triumph
of standing on the axis of the world, has
resulted in the opening up of many new
trade routes, the accumulation of obser-
vations regarding compass bearings that
have been of infinite value to navigators,
and the discovery of coal and other mineral
deposits which, though most of them are
left in reserve, may prove of inestimable
value in time to come. There’s no means
of balancing economic values or the worth
of scientific knowledge against the lives of
such men as Captain Robert Scott or Sir
John Franklin, but they did not die in
vain. The monetary cost of Polar explora-
tion, relative to the results achieved, has
been very small.
Formula of a brass alloy for _ big-end
brasses of internal-combustion engine, 100
h.p. ? —5307.
It is not considered good practice to use
brass alloys for big-end bearings unless lined
with one of the white anti-friction metals.
Assuming the brass is to be so lined would
recommend an alloy as follows: 88 copper,
10 tin and 2 zinc, and line the brass with
a tin base white metal such as Hoyt’s No. 11.
At ivhat rate does light travel? —5333.
Light waves of different lengths travel
with the same velocity in air or outer space,
but in transparent liquids and solids those
of the shortest wave-length travel slowest.
Michelsons’ determination of the speed of
light in air was 299,700,000 metres per
second, and Cornus estimated its speed as
300,300,000 metres per second. . It is usually
reckoned at 300,000,000 metres or 186,000
miles per second.
(1) Where should applications for posi-
tions at Australia House be made? (2) Is
preference given to Australian-born appli-
cants? (3) Prospect of securing position?—
5591.
(1) Official Secretary to the High Com-
missioner for Australia, the Strand, Lon-
don, W.C.2. (2) Yes. (3) At present the
staff is being reduced, and it would be diffi-
cult to obtain a position.
If a stick is placed in a bucket half full
of ivater it displaces an amount of water
equal to the volume of the stick immersed,
which consequently raises the surface of the
ivater and further immerses the stick, which
consequently displaces more water, and, so on.
Theoretically this would continue until the
bucket overflowed or the stick is fully
immersed. Why doesn’t it happen?— s4BB.
If a theory doesn’t tally with practice the
theory must be wrong. In your case you
have wrongly stated the theory and practice.
The water-level rises simultaneously with
the immersion of the stick, and is at any
stage exactly proportioned to the displace-
ment of the portion of the stick immersed.
If there’s enough water in the bucket the
stick can be fully immersed.
My five-year-old fox-terrier has been suf-
fering from dry eczema since he was a puppy.
What’s the best treatment? —5321.
Diet is important in cases of chronic
eczema. Starchy and sugary foods should
be avoided. Feed on meat occasionally,
alternated with green vegetables and gravy
and a little milk. Apply the following lotion,
first washing the dog in water and washing
soda and drying thoroughly: Sulphur, 40z.;
oil of tar, 4 0Z -; fish oil, 4oz. Leave on for
three days, then wash off and reapply.

Farm Accounts.
TRIAL BALANCE.—Having posted the Journal entries to the Ledger we must
now check them. It is just as well to go over each posting once again afterwards and
see that the entries are on the correct side of the Ledger, and that there are no errors
in the figures. Having done this, a Trial Balance may be taken out. This will only agree
when all the debit and credit entries of each item have been posted.
Starting with Account No. 1 in Harrow’s Ledger we find that the total credits
are £l5OO and that there are no debits; there is thus a credit balance of £l5OO. We
therefore write down the name of the account and its balance on a piece of journal-
ruled paper
TRIAL BALANCE. Dr. Cr.
lii I ;
I I H. Harrow, Capital Account j 1 I £l5OO 0 0
I ! ill
Then we go through the other Ledger accounts, find their balances by lead-pencil
calculations (balances must not be inked in until after the Trial Balance agrees), write
the name of the account and its folio in the Trial Balance, and put in the debit column
the debit balances, and in the credit column the credit balances. Here is the complete
Trial Balance, including the balance of Harrow’s Capital Account, shown above: —

If the two sides of a Trial Balance do not agree there is a mistake somewhere.
Every debit must have its corresponding credit, and where there is a difference in the
totals of the balances a search must be made to locate the error. In large businesses
tills is often very difficult, but in the accounts of a farm, with few entries in the
books, it should not take long when the principle of double-entry has been properly
grasped.
First of all, check your balances again—that is, see if the position is stated in
your Trial Balance as the Ledger really shows it. It is very easy to put a debit
balance down as a credit one, and vice versa. Such a mistake will, of course, throw
the whole thing out. The exact difference between the Trial Balance totals should be
noted, and kept in mind when searching. If, after checking the balances, no mistake can
be found, it will be necessary to check the postings again. This should be done
methodically, so that no entries are overlooked.
Sometimes the difference can be found by other means. For instance, an item
of £2O 6s. Bd. posted to the wrong side will throw the Trial Balance out by exactly
twice that amount, or £4O 13s. 4d. Thus, by halving the difference, an item of that
amount may be called to mind, and by tracing that item over again the error may be
located. Examples of mistakes to be guarded against are the posting of 2s. lOd. to
the Ledger as £2 10s., and vice versa, or £34 6s. Od. posted as £3O 4s. 6d.
Of course, the Journal itself might be wrong; there may be an error in one of the
entries in it. For instance, a debit entry might be £26 3s. Od., and the credit entry
shown as £2O 6s. 3d. Whether there are any such mistakes can be found out by
totalling the debit and credit columns of the Journal. The totals should agree.
In Ledger accounts containing a number of entries (Produce Sales Account, for
example) more than one page will probably be required for a year’s transactions. If so,
the totals of each side of the account will have to be carried forward to another page
of the Ledger. For instance, if the debits total £3 10s. Od. and the credits £1064 16s. 6d.,
you will start the new page of the Ledger Account by writing on the debit side
“Brought forward, £3 10s. 0d.,” and on the credit, “Brought forward, £1064 16s. 6d.”
Take care that you carry forward the correct amounts. The credit total, for instance,
might be carried forward in error as £1046 16s. 6d., the 6 and the 4 in the pounds
column being transposed.
The taking out of a Trial Balance is the first step towards compiling a profit and
loss account and balance-sheet from the books. If the time can be spared, it is just
as well to check your figures by taking out a Trial Balance every month (as we have
done with Harrow’s books), even though you balance only once a year. The Tidal
Balance, of course, does not form part of the double-entry system. It is merely a check
on that system.
BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT—Each week, where cash transactions
are numerous, or each month, in other cases, the Cash Account in the Ledger should be
agreed or “reconciled” with the bank Passbook. For this reason it is absolutely essential
that a special account be opened at the bank for the farm, if the book-keeping system,
as thus far explained, is to be adopted without difficulty. As the farmer becomes
more proficient as a book-keeper he may be able to manage with only one account at
his bank, but to begin with, at any rate, a separate account should be opened—say, a
“No. 2 Account.” Reconciling the Cash Account with the Passbook is not difficult,
and it is a very useful check. If all cheques drawn on, and all deposits paid into, the
bank, have been journalised and posted; and if all the cheques have been presented to,
and all deposits credited to the account by, the bank, then the balance of Cash Account
should equal the balance as per the Passbook. Sometimes it doesn’t; the reasons usually
are that the bank has charged exchange on cheques, which hasn’t been taken into account.
This can be rectified at once by totalling all such charges, and journalising and posting
them. Say the total bank charges to date come to Bs. 6d.; they are journalised as
follows:
JOURNAL. Dr. Cr.
General Exes. (Bank Charges), Dr. j j] 5 6 j
To Cash | I | 8 0
Being exchange on cheques, etc., charged by | |
bank to Feb. 28, 19..
I I! 1
Another thing that would upset the reconciliation would be a cheque paid in but later
dishonored. The person who gave the cheque must be debited, and Gash Account credited
as follows
JOURNAL. Dr. Cr.
J. Jones. Dr. i I £lO 10 6
To Cash | £lO 10 6
Being cheque received from Jones, paid into j j
bank, and subsequently dishonored.
I I
Having traced all such items the Passbook and Cash Account should have the same
balances, subject to cheques not yet presented by persons to whom you have given them,
and also subject to deposits, etc., paid in but not yet credited by the bank. Here is an
illustration.
Supposing the debit balance on Cash Account appears at £1065 3s. Od. (a debit
balance on the Cash Account means that your account at the bank is in credit). The
balance as per Passbook is £1059 19s. 3d. On comparing the Passbook with Cash
Account you find that you have not debited cash with 6s. 6d. of exchange charged by
the bank, that three cheques—for £lO, £4 6s. lOd. and £2O 18s. sd. respectively—issued
by you have not been presented, and that a deposit of £4O 2s. 6d. has not yet been
credited to your account by the bank. First of all, journalise and post the exchange
items —debit General Exes. (Bank Charges) and credit Cash Account with 6s. 6d.,
thus reducing the balance on Cash Account to £1064 16s. 6d. Then, on a page in the
Diary, you draw up a statement in the following form, adding on to your Cash Account
balance all outstanding cheques, and deducting therefrom all deposits paid in but not
credited: —
BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT.

A little thought will now show how essential it is to have a separate account at the
bank for the farm, and, further, how essential it is that all moneys received should be
paid into the bank, and not handed straight on to the grocer or feed-merchant. All small
items should be paid out of Petty Cash as before explained.
BUYING BREEDING EWES.
“Bud-G.” : Large numbers of breeding ewes
are being placed on the market, not so much
because the owners are forced to sell as to
give them an opportunity of disposing of
their culls and buying better ewes at a low
price to take their place. Graziers in need
of breeding ewes will need to be careful in
their selection.
Wool, size of frame and age are the fore-
most factors to be considered. Each line
inspected should be carefully looked through.
Catch a good number, mouth them and
examine well the quality and character of
the wool staple. If the line suits but con-
tains some broken-mouthed shee£, ask for a
rejection, and do the mouthing and culling
yourself.
Don’t buy ewes showing too far in lamb.
Try to have a look at the rams with which
the ewes were mated. The percentage of
lambs marked means in a big degree the
margin of profit.
Be present to take delivery of the sheep,
and see that 'a good drover is placed in
charge. Leave the rest to him, and the
ewes should be landed without many losses.
Interfere with your drover whilst on the
road, and there is bound to be trouble.
AN ANTI-BLOWFLY CAMPAIGN.
“Lucerne Flea”: It begins at lamb-
marking time. Before cutting off the tail
I snip off any folds or wrinkles around
the breech with a pair of shears. Then I
give the breech a liberal coating of an oint-
ment composed of four parts of clean mutton
tallow and one part of Stockholm tar,
melted together. This keeps the fly at bay
until the lambs have recovered.
Keeping the breech well crutched is the
only precaution I have found of any use.
Every second day all through the summer
I round up my sheep. A practised eye can
at once detect a “struck” sheep. The
affected parts are clipped close to the skin,
and an application of a good liquid dip is
well swabbed in. This brings the maggots
flying out, and a scrape with the boot-sole
does the rest. If left they only wriggle into
the earth and turn into flies, to> carry on
the destructive work.
Burying carcases is only a waste of time
—maggots can come up through five feet
of loose earth. I have an incinerator built
in a patch of rough ground, and with a fire-
break ploughed around it every spring. It
is a circular affair built of loose stone, with
firebars laid across it two feet from the
bottom. Every carcase, be it rabbit, sheep
or lamb, is carted down to the incinerator,
rolled on to the bars and a small fire laid
ready beneath. A week later the fire is lit;
by that time the carcase is filled with
maggots, laid there by the thousands of flies
which it has lured away from the live sheep.
In my S. Aus. district firewood is scarce,
but with the incinerator a very small fire
will consume several carcases, owing to the
fact that melted fat drips down on top of
the bars long after the wood has been con-
sumed. On the rare occasions when a
horse or cow dies I drag it on to the fallow
and burn it there.
While the precautions outlined will
greatly minimise blowfly damage, we shall
not be able to conquer the fly until it is
an offence to leave as much as a rabbit
carcase in the paddock unburned. The
blowfly wasn't much of a pest until millions
of rotting rabbit, sheep and other carcases
gave it a chance to increase beyond Nature s
balance of things.
TAS. EXPERIENCE OF SUB. CLOVER.
“Lien”: It took a great deal of experi-
menting to arrive at the correct methods
of sowing, harvesting and threshing sub-
terranean clover, but in Tasmania it has
been done. After repeated failures we found
that the seed is best sown in the autumn
February is the month I prefer. The secret
of success is not to bury clover seed of any
description. We usually sow heavily, 21b.
per acre with Jib. of other clovers (White
Dutch, Cluster Clover, Alsyke) mixed in.
Having sowed your crop of oats, wheat
or whatever your cereal happens to be,
harrow the crop. If it is to be a permanent
pasture sow bushel of grass seed per
acre and harrow with brush harrows. If
you are sowing any cpiantity you need a
manure distributer. Mix your clover with
half the amount of manure you had to sow
with your oats. If you intend to sow lcwt.
of manure per acre put icwt. through the
drill and mix the other icwt. with 21b. of
clover and top dress the cultivation with
this mixture. But don’t leave seed and
manure mixed overnight or you will kill all
the seed. And roll your ground to hold the
moisture. When you harvest your crop you
will have a fine ley.
Subterranean is barely worth harvesting
till the second or third year, as it is not
thick enough. Our experience with the tip-
rake is to give the crop plenty of field room
if a little green. The Tas. Agricultural
Department bought a clover-drum from
Maoriland for use on sub. clover. It is pain-
fully slow and cracks a great deal of the
seed, though it makes an excellent job of the
small clovers. Brumby Bros., of Longford, with
their big drum threshed four 9ft. .by 6ft.
stacks of clover at Rhodes and barely cracked
a seed. They threshed 26 bags of first-class
subterranean, 1451 b. to the bag, all fit for
shipment direct to market. They also filled
54 bags containing the finer clovers already
mentioned mixed with subterranean; when
separated by sieving these should yield
another 10001 b. of sub. clover and 30001 b. of
a mixture of the small clovers. The crop
came off 23 acres. Four other farmers in
the district with not nearly such a heavy
crop have sold their seed at 2s. per lb. all
round and cleared from £7 10s. to £lO per
acre. These crops were all free from lucerne
flea.
PIG FATTENING AND PRODUCTION.
“Curlew”: The Roseworthy (S.A.) Agri-
cultural College has carried out some
valuable experiments in pig-feeding. Thirty-
six Berkshire pigs were used in nine pens
of four pigs each. Ages ranged from nine
to seventeen weeks. The experiment was
continued for 98 days.
A basal ration of 2gal. of skim-milk and
61b. of pollard was used during the fifth
week’s feeding, when the pigs averaged 1061 b.
each, but the amounts fed were in proportion
to the weight of the pigs, approximately
51b. of dry matter being fed per 1001 b. live
weight. Wheat, barley and peas were also
fed, and a lick was constantly before certain

A Clear Statement of Facts
Prices of Diamond Batteries are lower than prices of imported batteries.
Make a comparison of each line and note the savings.
Diamond Batteries are “Eight Weeks Fresher” than imported batteries; this
means at least two months’ extra service. Battery costs are reduced both
with a Diamond —initial cost and cost of upkeep.
Diamond Batteries Chosen for Their Greater Reliability
Their construction is distinctive; the “Section-protected” principle obviates danger of leakage so prevalent
in many batteries.
Diamond Batteries make for clearer and truer reception and guarantee longer service.
A Few of the Many Tributes from Users
Mr. J.B. writes (name on application): “I have tried different brands of dry cells on my two-valve set and
none have lasted as long as the Diamond.
Mr. A.H.P. writes (name on application): “Last August I purchased two 45-volt Diamond ‘B’ Batteries.
My set has been in use for 275 days—five or six hours daily—and the set is doing well.”
Mr. A.O. writes (name on application): “You may be interested to know that we have now sold more than
500 Diamond 45-volt and 60-volt ‘B’ Batteries, and customers, after trying the Diamond, invariably specify
nothing but Diamond.”
Mr. J.L.N. writes (name on application): “I have found that Diamond Batteries are the best that I have
ever used. They are silent in operation and very effective.”

Results showed that peas gave the greatest
increase in live weight, but the profit in this
case was slightly less than from barley or
wheat. Equal parts of barley, wheat and
peas yielded the greatest net profit, 265. 4d.
per pen. Barley boiled gave a mere 6s. sd.
profit, as against 255. lOd. when used raw.
Only 235. Id. profit was shown when no
lick was available for the pigs. In another
experiment in which oats were also used it
appeared that a slight advantage was derived
from crushing the grain.
Clearly grain, good or inferior, might be
turned into pork or bacon with enormous
benefit to a country which is so strangely
short of swine. The pig is one of the great
sources of Ilooverland’s wealth. How many
Australians realise that the Invincible Re-
public owns more than sixty times as many
pigs as this Commonwealth does?
SCIENCE AND MILK PRODUCTION.
“Alf Alpha” : Milch cows can be over-fed
with protein. You cannot alter the com-
position of the milk by feeding. If, for
example, the milk of a Friesian cow is
testing 2.8 per cent, fat; it is impossible
to increase this to 4 per cent, by increasing
the quantity and quality of the food. But
whilst you cannot improve the quality of
the milk, you can increase the quantity.
A cow in milk can transfer into milk a
much larger proportion of the digestible
energy in her food than her sister who is
being fattened. It has been calculated that
where a milch cow is utilising 1001 b. of
food to produce milk, a beast which is being
fattened can only utilise 801 b. of the 1001 b.
to produce beef.
A few things the dairymen should note
(1) The nutritive requirements of their
milkers are directly dependent on the com-
position of the milk.
(2) Approximately 50 per cent, of the
digestible protein contained in the food is
found in the milk.
(3) A large excess of protein does not
stimulate the yield.
(4) As the fat and sugar in the milk are
obtained from carbohydrates, the casein
(■protein) content of the milk provides a
trustworthy guide in feeding protein.
(5) It takes less of an all-round diet to
produce a gallon of milk having a 2.75 test
than it does to produce a gallon of milk
testing 5 p.c. fat. The latest research shows
that where a bushel of bran fed in the all-
round ration produces a definite quantity of
milk having a 2.75 test, 281 b. of bran would
be required in similar circumstances to pro-
duce the same quantity of milk with a 5
per cent. test.
Give Strawberry as much as she will eat,
but balance your protein as under (2) and
your fat as under (5). Then both you and
the cow will benefit.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Can I apply a top-dressing of phosphoric
acid with a spray? I reckon it would he 30
per cent, cheaper than using super. —s 434.
If applied in the form of “acid,” insoluble
phosphates of iron and/or aluminium would
be produced and as the cost per unit of
phosphoric acid is £3 10s. and of super-
phosphate only 55., the process you inquire
about would be 14 times as expensive.
How to control cockspur (“Saucy Jack ”) ?
By cultivation and by mowing before the
seed has properly formed. Burning off is
also helpful. An old binder with the plat-
form cut out will generally be found more
suitable than a mowing machine for cutting
weeds, as the knives of the binder are not
so easily broken. The best time for mow-
ing weeds to prevent seeding is just after the
seed-heads have formed, before the seed has
developed to any extent. If the weeds are
cut too soon they will sucker and set a
second crop of seed, which will be difficult
to cut. After mowing the land should be'
stocked fairly heavily in order that the sheep
will eat a considerable amount of the second
growth, which will occur in any circumstances.
It will frequently pay to overstock paddocks
to some extent and starve the sheep a little,
in order to compel them to eat any second
growth that comes.
To what family does the click beetle
belong, and is it injurious to crops? —s3sl.
Elateridce contains the well-known “skip-
jack” or “click” beetles, whose larvae, known
as wireworms, are familiar pests of crops.
The members of the genus. Alaus, however,
are notable in having larvae which prey on
the timber-boring weevil and longicorn
larvae, and are consequently of value in the
control of forest insect pests.
(1) How to cure bonc-chewing in, cattle?
(2) Where can bone-meal be obtained in
N.S.W. ? —5364.
(1) In the case of hand-fed cows add
two or three tablespoons of sterilised bone-
meal to the feed daily. Where the cattle
are not hand-fed, a lick of sterilised bone-
meal should be provided. Alternatively, the
cattle should be fed on good food grown out-
side the bone-chewing areas, or on land
inside which has been fertilised with animal
manure, bonedust or superphosphate. The
addition of bran or oil-cake to the ration
and the feeding of lucerne hay will be help-
ful. The use of animal manure, bonedust or
super, is recommended as a top-dressing for
pastures. (2) Metropolitan Meat Industry
Board, Homebush Bay, Sydney.
(1) What arc the benefits derived from
subsoiling orchard land? (2) How should
subsoiling be carried 0ut? —5603.
(1) Snbsoiling opens up the soil and allows
the free entrance of moisture and air, thus
opening up a greater area in which the tree
roots can operate. It is usually resorted to
where the subsoil is stiff. (2) Loosen the
soil to a depth of 12 to 24 or even more inches,
leaving the subsoil in the position where
nature has placed it. The lower layers of the
soil should not be brought to the surface.
This work is usually done by spade, in the
case of small areas, or by specially con-
structed ploughs. Explosives have beei*-used
in some cases. The work is best completed
just prior to the first heavy winter rains
while the subsoil is dry, as in this condition
it is more easily pulverised. Explosives should
not be used when the subsoil is moist, especi-
ally if it is inclined to be clayey, as the
force of the explosion will tend to compact
the soil rather than shatter it.
(1) I have heard that grafted citrus fruit
trees die at the end of 10 years. If that is
true , what is the cause? (2) How long do
grafted custard-apple trees take to hear.
5493.
(1) The statement is not correct. Trees
budded or grafted 70 years ago are still in
good condition in the Emu Plains and 1 arra-
matta (N.S.W.) districts. (2) They should
begin to bear three to four years after plant-
ing, but profitable crops cannot be expected
from them until they are six to seven years
old.
(1) Can almonds he grown profitably
under irrigation? (2) What are the best,
commercial varieties? (3) Average prices
received by groivcrs for large quantities.
(4) Distance apart to plant ? —sl43.
(1) Yes: provided the drainage is good and
the soil suitable. Being deep-rooted it will
thrive and produce profitable crops in soils
much too deep for the peach or apricot. The
almond cannot be successfully grown in low-
lying situations subject to frost, nor in
heavy, badly drained soils. (2) Brandis
(Brande’s Jordon), White Nonpareil, and
Riverside. Peerless, three varieties raised in
S. Aus., are inter-pollinators, and the two
first-mentioned are favored by the Melbourne
merchants. It is important, when planting
almonds, to remember that most varieties
are self-sterile, and simultaneous bloomers
must be planted for inter-pollinating pur-
poses. (3) Ninepence to lOd. per pound.
Brandis usually realises from Id. to 2d. more
per pound than other varieties. (4) Twenty
feet to 24ft. planted on the square system.
When planted on rich soil, the greater dis-
tance is recommended. When planted as a
windbreak, the trees are planted much
closer.
Best way of destroying sparrows? —s379.
Ten pounds of wheat or cracked corn
thoroughly moistened with milk, but not drip-
ping, are prepared, and five-sixths of an
ounce of strychnine is dusted over this
moistened grain,, which is stirred thoroughly.
Scatter the grain where the sparrows will
get it, but remember that you are dealing
with a deadly poison. You must collect and
burn the dead bodies of the birds—especially
if they are in roof-gutters.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Grey Box”: It pays to spend a few
minutes on the plough after its work is done.
Slack off all adjusting nuts, grease the worms
and tighten up again. Then wipe all dirt
off the mouldboards and give them a liberal
coat of good-quality axle-grease. This will
defy any weather for months, and when
ploughing time comes around again half an
hour’s work in any but sticky soil will result
in shining boards, which means light draught
and good work right away, as well as longer
life for the boards.
“X. Cocky”: An example to avoid. Dur-
ing a recent week I gave a cow a few sun-
flower heads to eat each day. At the next
churning and for several following the cream
refused to break to butter. Quantity or
quality of milk was not affected. No more
sunflowers were given her and conditions
returned to normal.
“Quirk”: Don’t throw away waste oil
from the tractor. If allowed to settle and
then carefully poured off it will be freed
from sediment. In an open container over
an outside fire heat the oil to about 190
deg. Fahr. for half an hour; the kerosene
content will then escape. The treated oil
can be used as a general farm lubricant for
implements other than engines. Even with-
out treatment waste oil makes an excellent
wood preservative, or can be used to lay the
dust on the floor of the barn or sheds.
“Vetinind”: To darken bridles and
saddlery, cover with bread and milk for about
15 minutes ; brush off, and apply castor oil
thickly. Incidentally, castor oil is a fine
dressing for all saddlery; it renders the
leather waterproof, as well as protecting it
from rats and insects.
“Brady’s Lookout”: Sometimes working
in the bush a man finds his billycan full of
ants. Here’s a sure cure. Burn a small
patch (and don’t set the country alight doing
it) a. bit bigger than the can, and stand
the billy on it. Ants won’t cross fresh-burnt
ground.
“C.H.P.”: For sticky oilskins, put lib.
washing soda in two gallons of water and
boil it: let it stand till lukewarm, put the
coat in and let it soak for 24 hours. Then
spread on the floor, scrub with a soft brush
and soapy water. Rinse in three or four
waters, and hang up to dry. To dress, add
a tablespoon of copal varnish to one pint of
raw linseed oil and put on the coat very
thinly. Roll it up tightly for 24 hours;
then dry the coat with a stick through the
arms. It will be ready to wear after about
12 hours’ drying.
“Bufforp”: Introduce a little oily meal,
such as linseed or oilcake, into the fowls’
mash. This supplies the essential oils for
the moult, which is a severe drain on the
bird. But don’t overdo it, or you’ll get them
too fat and probably stop them laying. The
pullets don’t want as much.
“Klondike”: It pays to attend to the
proper stencilling of fruitcases. Neat and
distinct black lettering is a proven aid
to marketing; indeed, appearance often
counts for as much as quality. Have
nothing but your own name on one end,
and on the other arrange size, grade,
name and other details in proper order. A
wire-binding machine is well worth the hire
money, and if it saves only one case from
breakage it has paid for itself.
“Disc Harrow”: Go through the orchard
now and make a note of all those useless
trees. It is an exceptional place that hasn’t
any. Then give the order, and this winter
replace with something worth while. Each of
those old wood-growers was wasting 400
square feet of ground, and to-day every yard
must pay its way.
“Westralian”: Further to Gnowangerup’s
achievement in the Centenary Year wheat
competition (B. 5/2/’3O), the winners’ farm
averages should be mentioned. Mr. Cockram
averaged 42% bushels from 120 acres; Mr.
Macdonald 36% bushels from 280 acres, and
Mr. Beeck 28 bushels from 600 acres. Three
striking examples of the results of up-to-date
Eastern States farming methods when applied
to wheat lands in Westralia.

The perfect motor-car has arrived. It has
a more powerful, silent and reliable engine,
and a more beautiful body than any of the
other models, and it also does twice as many
miles to the gallon, and is much lighter on
tyres. All extras previously included, and
many others hitherto unheard of are to be
found on this model. In fact, there is not
another car on the market to compare with
it.

ANOTHER WAR BOOK.
An Anzac Bares His Soul.
( A.P.M. Cable Service.)
London: Bunkke and Bunkke, the publ-
ishers, have revealed that “Corporal Blood,’
the anonymous author of “Agony,” is none
other than Major (now Brigadier-General)
Headwork, V.D., of Australia. A “Times”
reviewer says of “Agony” :
The opening chapters of this epic work tell of the
author’s first terrible experiences in France, after
patriotic but unavailing efforts to keep the home
fires burning in Australia. He was thrown straight
into the hellish maelstrom of life at a Corps H.Q.
Seldom has stark discomfort been expressed with
more poignant economy of phrase than in his diary.
As we read we can see that sensitive spirit shudder-
ing under the bludgeon blows of the War Machine:—
“Dee. 2: Found fire unlighted in office after break-
fast. Compelled to wait while scoundrelly batman
lit it. This may mean cold in head. Placed batman
under arrest. Charge: ‘lnsubordination and impu-
dence in face of enemy.’ ”
“Dec. 3: Got new batman.”
“Dec. 4: Lunched Officers’ Club. Ordered porter-
house steak; served instead with veal, which 1
hate. Complained secretary. Insulted. Cold develop-
ing.”
“Dec. 5: Cold arrived. Confined bed.”
“Dec. 6: Placed new batman under arrest. Charge:
‘Conduct to the prejudice of good order and military
discipline’ (i.e., forgetting to fill my hot-water
bottle).”
“Dec. : New batman.”
“Dec. 10: Convalescent, but weak. Have applied
Blighty leave.”
We follow him with painful interest back to the
Front—he is now at Base Records, a bare 50 miles
from the fighting—and so to Australia and his new
job of C.O. Troops on a transport. The Germans
begin submarining transports. His colds return,
attacking him violently in the feet, as well as in
the head. He applies for a D.S.O. and home service
“for the duration,” and is awarded the latter.
A fiold-marslial, interviewed by the
“Daily Mail,” said: “The book shows that
all the armies had ’em.”
“Fliegendc Blatter”: “If only the other
Australians had been like this - cultured,
soldierly and inoffensive officer!”

THE SLIP.
The attention of the tram was riveted
on the two ladies who were chatting brightly
in clear, cultivated tones.
“She has purchased a candelabra,” smiled
one “and to hear her panegyrics one might
pardonably conclude that the decoration, and
likewise the rococo specimens of Byzantine
art in its vicinity,
were sacrosanct
from criticism.”
“N e vertheless,”
sighed the other,
“she is, I fear, an
irremediable, igno-
ramus. In indicat-
ing to acquaint-
ances her refectory
table, I have re-
peatedly heard her
accentuate the ter-
minal syllables of
the word refectory
as in the place-
name Tobermory.
When remonstrated
with, she invari-
ably becomes
querulous, and
maintains her un-
tenable deviation
from linguistic
exactitude w i t h
irridentist arro-
gance.”
“To employ an
apophthegm,” be-
gan the other
sadly.
At this stage a
worker, who had
been listening
admiringly, started
as though stung,
and then, leaning-
over, tapped the
speaker respect-
fully on the knee.
“You don’t sound
the ‘ph’ as in Adol-
phus, Mum,” he said
firmly. “Nor you
don’t pronounce the
‘g m’ as in ‘gum’
neither. ‘A p p o-
them’ (the ‘th’ be-
ing sounded as in
‘thick’) is the prc-
ferred use.”
And the other passengers, turning hur-
riedly to their “B. B. C. Way Lists,” as
approved by the Advisory Committee on
Spoken English under the presidency of the
Poet Laureate, and reprinted in the Sydney
papers, found that he was perfectly right.

“Say Bo” : Offhand most theatregoers would
probably say that Pinero was dead, but he
has always been subject to long spells of
taciturnity. He had not been heard of
since pre-war days, when he suddenly came
to light with a three-act play in 1922. He
is now reported to have finished two new
pieces—one a joyous domestic comedy, the
other a depressing study of low life.
“Li.H.P.”: “Frankenstein,” adapted from
Shelley’s narrative by Peggy Webling at the
Little Theatre, London, is not the first
drama on the subject. Over 50 years ago
Sydney was familiar with Dick Peake’s ver-
sion, which had Edmund Holloway as the
Monster. Holloway called himself “The T.
P. Cooke of Australia,” and loved to strut
in roles associated with the great English
actor. Cooke had made a great hit in Peake’s
play in Paris as well as in London.
“Craiser”: George Wallace is usually
regarded as a peculiarly Australian produc-
tion, but the fact that after his present sea-
son at Melbourne Tivoli he goes to a fine
London contract suggests that his stuff isn’t
far from the Cockney brand. F'ears were
expressed that Dennis’s “Sentimental Bloke”
film would not be understood in the Great
Smoke, but when it was displayed in 1922
Liza and her bloke found that Lil’ Bourke-
street and Whitechapel spoke practically a
common tongue.
“Lights”: Marie Lorraine (Isobel
McDonagh), the heroine of the McDonagh
Sisters’ pictures, was one of Australia’s first,
movie queens. Asa girl she commenced
with Beaumont Smith, maker of several local
productions, appearing in “Joe,” an adapta-
tion of Henry Lawson’s yarn. Afterwards
she formed, with her two sisters, a producing
company, and starred in “Those Who Love”
and “The Far Paradise.” The sisters, who
are about to release “The Cheaters,” deserve
credit for their enterprise.
“Dramofilm”: “M.G.S.” recently referred
to “The Good Oil,” by Edward Carroll, as
“a lonely phenomenon” in Australian plays.
It isn’t by Carroll, and is about as Aus-
tralian as a speech by Jock Garden. As
“The Easy Mark” it first appeared in New
York six years ago, when it had a run of
95 performances. The author’s name was
given as Jack Larrie. Most of these domestic
comedies can be adapted to suit any English-
speaking country.
“Hamfat”: On the ground that the talkie
is an enemy in any form and an accursed
thing, members of the Musicians’ Union
have declined to supply orchestras to make
the music for Australian synchronised films.
As they can hardly imagine that their howls
will check the tide, their idiotic stand simply
means handicapping a local industry that
might assist them to salve a few of their jobs.
The Inky Way
The A.J.A. will be having its 21st birth-
day next year, and the Federal Council is
being asked to arrange some celebration. Syd
Pratt, the general secretary, has held office
since 1911, and has attended every conference
of the council that has been hold. Present
general president is Harry Cur wen, of the
“Age.”
Queensland journalism will mourn the
passing of Sam Mathers, who went to press
in Brisbane the other day. For a great
many years he was one of the outstanding
personalities of the Gulf country. In the
days when .Croydon goldfield was booming
and Normanton thrived thereby, Sam owned
find edited the “Norman Chronicle.” He
was also comp, and printer, and finally deliv-
ered the issue on horseback. The old man
was a mine of yarns in his later days, and
many a long-forgotten Gulf celebrity lived
again in his spoken and written memories.
Next month P. J. Bennett will complete
40 years’ service on the Melbourne “Herald”
and “Weekly Times.” For nearly all
the time lie has been the evening sheet’s
Yic. political and departmental man. He
has seen 17 Parliaments and 25 Govern-
ments ; Speaker Alec Peacock is the only
remaining member of the 143 who had seats
when P.J. first paraded the lobbies. For 25
years or more Bennett has been chairman
of the Yic. Press Gallery Committee. He
was general president of the A.J.A. in
1918-20, and was. previously State president.
A. J. Yilliers, the young Hobart journalist
who periodically takes a job before the mast,
is now doing cable work in London for
Australian papers. His seafaring has supplied
him with material for three novels. “The
Windship,” was the first; his voyage in the
Ilcrzogin Cecilie is described in “To Fal-
mouth for Orders,” and now “The Cruise of
the Grace Harwar” is on the press. It will
be illustrated with photographs taken by
Ronald Walker, a young Tasmanian who
was in the ship with Yilliers and lost his
life near the M.L. coast.
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any
good. The money crisis that has skittled
the share market and draped most news-
papers in mourning for lost advertisements
has given the “ ‘Wild Cat’ Monthly” the
largest circulation of its uneventful career.
The “Monthly” specialises in information
and advice to investors, and at the moment
investors want advice and information about
many things.
C. R. Bradish, one time of The Bulle
tin’s Melbourne office, has been given long
leave from Melbourne “Herald” to sample
London : he leaves this month with his wife
and infant. Bradish used to be Edmund
Fisher’s understudy, and he will test London
with some of his stage studies. The success
of his two friends Harrison Owen and Dale
Collins encourages him.
“Warwick”: The London “Times” has
been granted armorial bearings, the first
instance of such a distinction being conferred
on a newspaper company. Apropos, there
is a legend of an Australian newspaper pro-
prietor who once invited his underlings to
suggest a crest for the publication, stipulat-
ing for “something heraldic and appropriate.”
It was a morose sub-editor, so the story goes,
who whispered that a famous cognisance’
“The Bear and Ragged Staff,” would about
meet the case, but retained sufficient regard
for his job not to suggest it openly.
“Henry Handel” Richardson gets the Aus-
tralian Literature Society’s medal for what
it judges to be last year’s best Australian
novel—“Ultima Thule.” Two Bulletin
prize stories were the runners-up—“Coonar-
doo” and “A House Is Built.’-
A TRIBUTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“One Hollywood actress who is now a top-liner
worked at the soda fountain in a drug store five
years ag0.... A man who 10 years back was driving
a milk-cart is now a star on a princely salary.”
Whene’er of Reginald de Varre
I cliance to think, now that he is
A world-famed moving-picture star,
Amassing thousands from his biz.,
My mind runs back to Billy Jones,
Who drove his cart about our street,
And mem’ry says in kindly tones
“He used to bring us lovely meat!”
Pictures for me have small appeal,
And Reggie’s strutting makes me tired
When I have watched him, reel by reel—•
It seems so plainly uninspired.
So though the ads. a mighty noise
About his Thespian talents make,
This tribute still my thought employs:
“There was great virtue in his steak.”
It may be that he’s fine; I’ll let
The flapping flappers have their say,
Just adding that no butch. I’ve met
Has brought such sirloin round our way.
Perhaps he looks a Stageland prince,
Maybe his name the programme tops,
I’m only sure that no one since
Has served us with such tender chops!

“Oroi”: Included in the list of Papuan
exports for the six months to the end of
December is 284 tons of desiccated cocoanut
valued at £15,605, all of which went to Aus-
tralia. The industry, which was only founded
recently, should prove a valuable asset to
the Possession. In past years most of the
stuff imported to Australia lias come from
Ceylon.
* * * *
“Launch”: That British motor-boats have
a reputation as high as British cars is shown
by An order recently placed with one of the
leading English makers. This is for 33 fast
and seaworthy craft required by the
Brazilian Government for the suppression of
smuggling in Rio Bay. Their length is from
30ft. to 44ft. and their speed from 25 to
30 m.p.h.

“Gad” : If someone in Jo’burg or Dunedin
sends me a British postal order our G.P.O.
here will have nothing to do with it. Here
is the ritual —in case you get one. Go with
it to G.P.O. window marked “Postal notes
changed.” Pass note over. Clerk looks at it
and says, “Sorry, we cannot change it.”
He then gives you a card with the name
and address of a certain philatelist on it.
“Go there,” he says. The philatelist will
change it —but not for nothing! You may
lose as much as two whole shillings on a
pound in the process.
* * * *
“Scalper”: In deciding to allow ticket-
holders to break their journeys under certain
restrictions the N.S.W. railways have
thrown off and ancient and hidebound tradi-
tion inherited from Britain. Anyone may
now get off at an intermediate station when
the holder of a single ticket for a journey
of over 100 miles, provided the full journey
is completed within seven days of the date
of the ticket’s issue. The ticket must be left
at the station until the journey is resumed.
* * * *
“Raja”: As tinned music is displacing
the fiddler so is mechanical telegraphy oust-
ing the expert sound-reader. For 30 years I
translated dots and dashes into urgent pleas
from impoverished trippers or passionate out-
pourings from parted lovers. Of several hun-
dred operators in the G.P.O. Melbourne, we
could name any one after sending a few
words over the Tasmanian cable; but nowa-
days it is a soulless business. A high-speed
automatic buzzes out lengths of typed tape,
which is gummed down, and there might be
a robot at the other end for all the differ-
ence there is between one message and
another.
* * * *
“Hayband”: Few Australian ventures
have justified themselves so promptly as rice-
growing. A dozen years ago all our require-
ments were imported; now there is already
a margin for export to M.L. and the islands.
And there are plenty of other markets com
paratively handy. Java imports annually
£8,000,000 worth of rice, and the huge
Japanese demand grows yearly. Ample
acreage is available; 53,000 in the ’Bidgee
irrigation area alone.
* * * *
“Counterjumper”: During six years as a
mercery assistant I have sold men’s shirts,
ties, socks, underwear, pullovers, pyjamas and
overcoats to women for their personal use,
have fitted out men in ladies’ underwear,
have been asked for “celluloid” instead of
cellular underwear, “crumb” or “chrome”
instead of kobe silk, all without moving an
eye. But I was affected yesterday when a
modern Mrs. Malaprop, seeking cheviot
serge, ingenuously asked for “Chevrolet”
trousers.
* * * *
“Hans der Boatman”: That Germany is
out to regain her old share of the mercantile
marine trade is seen in the recent merger of
interests for a 50-year period at least between
N. D. Lloyd and the Hamburg-America lines.
Both are once more bulking big in the trans-
Atlantic traffic; in addition the H.A. has
a big South American trade, and the N.D.L.
is gradually picking up the threads of its
old Asian connection. The third of the big
GSrmau trio, the Hansa (“Black German”)
line, is not yet in the merger, but will pro-
bably have to join. The resulting chop in
freights may give shipping folk of competing
nations something to think about.
* * * *
“Riroriro”: The kauri-tree of M.L. has
so nearly vanished that to talk about re-
establishing it seems like butting into the
creation business. The State Forest Service
is going to try what it can do, working at
the nurseries already in use for exotics at
the Waipoua Forest, the biggest remaining
stand of mature trees. David Hutchins, the
first forester to consider the question, said
the kauri could and should be regenerated.
It is true the real old-man tree has a life
history of thousands of years, but he
reckoned rikas could be developed into useful
size in a mere 300 or 400. There may be
something in it for the State, but the indi-
vidual who wants to make provision for his
old age won’t get much comfort out of
planting kauris.
* * * *
“Piecrust”: The High Court of Australia
has been delving deep into the mysteries of
cheese-making. A Brisbane manufacturer
was sued for infringing the patented process
of another company, which, by raising cheese
to a temperature of 175 degrees, claimed to
enable it to be “kept permanently.” The
argument hinged on the meaning to be
attached to the adverb. In the lower court
the plaintiffs admitted that “permanently”
was only a comparative term, but produced
evidence to show that a cheese that had
travelled to Singapore and back remained in
perfect condition, and reckoned that was per-
manent enough for anything. They won their
case but the verdict was upset on appeal,
the Queensland Full Court holding that “per-
manently” must be given its literal meaning.
In the High Court two Judges took the view
that “as cheese was meant for consumption
and not for preservation in a museum, a
cheese which could travel to Singapore and
back without cold storage facilities complied
with the conditions,” but the other three
upheld the Full Court’s ruling. The next
patent will probably be worded more
cautiously.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Melbourne trainers have tried out their
Doncaster and Sydney Cup candidates. Vic.
representation at Randwick will be—numeri-
cally at all events —stronger than was anti-
cipated. By finishing ahead of Figure in the
Quality Handicap at Moonee Valley on Eight
Hours Day, Spanish Galleon encouraged E.
M. Pearce to send her over. The style in
which she came home on that occasion
earned the filly a visit to N.S.W. racing
headquarters. Spanish Galleon was rather
far back early in the contest. Ned O’Dwyer
kept on testing Albert Coppel’s Durward,
whose latest effort in public was to run
unplaced in the Epsom Plate last Saturday.
On this form O’Dwyer must be a super-
optimist to imagine that the chestnut has a
1000 to 1 chance in the Doncaster; yet
Durward was entrained two days later.
Perhaps O’Dwyer hopes to pull off a coup
such as that which he landed in the Caulfield
Cup a few seasons ago. All that can be said
for Durward is that he finished. strongly at
Epsom.
If First Arrow captures the Doncaster
and Caramelo the Sydney Cup there- will
be an Anglo-Maoriland flavor about the
double victory. Both horses were bred in
England, while their trainers hail from the
Dominion, though long domiciled in Mel-
bourne. Lou Robertson (First Arrow) and
D. J. Price (Caramelo) are old friends.
Former’s string for Sydney includes Hebrus
and Cimbrian, half-brothers to Heroic, whose
dam (Chersonese) cost A. T. Creswick a
tidy sum at the Moses’ breakup sale. Cara-
melo won the Eight Hours’ Handicap at
Moonee Valley, atoning for losing a more
valuable event over a longer distance on
the previous Saturday. Altered method of
riding made all the difference. Caramelo was
improving with every gallop when he left
home.
Bert .Price, son of Carame.lo’s trainer,
appropriated the Epsom event, in which Dur-
ward finished outside the money. He did
it with Byron, a cast-off from Bill Burke’s
stable, ridden by apprentice J. Wenn.
Betting was peculiar. King of Revelry
opened favorite. Birdcage ousted him, but
King of Revelry went out in hot demand
at 5 to 2, Birdcage having eased from 7
to 2 to 5 to 1. It threatened to be a one-
horse race until Byron smothered King of
Revelry at the distance and scored bril-
liantly. Isocrates, who formerly belonged
to Sol Green but now is the property of
Lou Robertson, ran third, with Birdcage
and Durward (almost level) heading the
others. Cape Borda, winner of the Epsom
Purse, is another discarded prad, with (like
Byron) a record of two successive victories.
E. M. Pearce did not consider the Treclare
gelding worth persevering with, but at four
years Cape Borda is revealing fine stamina.
Purse distance was 1| miles and time tied
the course record of 2min. 35sec.
Last winter J. A. MacLeod, of the V.R.C.
committee, and his friend C. F. Taylor
annexed the Grand National Steeple at
Flemington with Sandhurst. They were
lucky to win the Brush Steeple at Epsom
with Cellist, who is somewhat new to the
jumping game. With a stand-up, Bombard-
ment could not have lost. His disappear-
ance made the race a gift to Tom Bourke,
but Don Zealley was over confident. He
allowed Tom Bourke to slacken speed, and
Cellist finishing at a terrific pace, scored
by half a neck. Stewards suspended Zealley
for a month.
". . • •
Dick Bradfield, mentor of many Melbourne
Cup winners annexed a double at Epsom,
His first leg, 'Larmen, was a hot pot for the
juvenile event; but Bradfield’s own neddy,
Bunker Hill, went out at substantial odds
for the Novice Mile, having been vanquished
in a small race at the Kyneton Cup fixture.
Larmen is by Seremoud, sire of Mollison.
Spang, from Adelaide, brought his tally of
Melbourne victories up to three by romping
home in the middle-distance March Handi-
cap.

Rosehill results on Saturday put fielders
in great heart for the autumn campaign, not
a favorite getting home in the eight events,
There was little support for Scotch Rose in
the first division of the Juvenile, and the
Ilosewing filly went out at 12’s to beat a
warm favorite in Moallin (5 to 2) by a

BILL: “We’re on another tack now.”
BELL: “Good Heavens! That means a fresh puncture, of course.”
head. Another well-backed one went down
in the second section, Cronulla (2’s) being
pipped by half a head, after an all-the-way
battle, by Goldfind (B’s).
Denis Boy, an imported colt by Soldennis,
opened his account in the Maiden Handicap.
The immigrant, starting at 7’s, beat Draco-
nic (6’s) in another close finish, with Ivenso,
backed to 3’s, well back in the ruck.
The opening division of the Highweight
Handicap went to the Claro gelding High
Disdain, a 6 to 1 shot. Piloted by D.
Munro, the ex-M.L. nag won from Casque
D’Or, the latter, solidly backed to 4’s, giving
the winner 211 b. The win considerably
shortened High Disdain’s price for the Don-
caster. True Shaft, a stablemate of Night-
march, was backed down to 9 to 2 on the
course, for the second division, and duly
landed the coup with Roy Reed in the
saddle. Poitiers, at 7to 4, failed to catch a
place.
The big boil-over came in the Club Handi-
cap. Crucis was the pea at 4’s, with Rions-
cup a point longer. New Sweet, with F.
Hickey up, stayed out the 11 furlongs to
get home by a length and a half from
Rionscup and Crueis. Winner’s price was
25 to 1.
Pretty Bett (7’s) took the Trial Stakes
from Voleuse (10’s), the latter dosing fast
at the finish, by half a length. The Rydal-
mere Mile saw the Queenslander Charlie
B complete a disastrous day for punters by
a comfortable three-lengths win from
Waugoola, with King Conrad third. The
winner started at B’s, the favorites, Amor
and Gwillian G, both at s’s, failing to catch
the judge’s eye.
Ted Bartle, winner of six events at Moore-
field the previous week, could not even run
into a place on this occasion.

“Aintree” : This year’s Liverpool G. N. pro-
vided the usual smack in the pocket-book for
punters, the favorite, Sir Lindsay, owned by
American J. IT. Whitney, getting no nearer
than third. The winner, Shaun Gollin, is
an Irisli-bred gelding by an unknown sire,
and went out at 100 to 8. The nastiest
knock came from the withdrawal of Easter
Hero, also owned by Whitney, which was
backed for cartloads of money from the
time the entries came out. Shaun Gollin
won the Sefton Steeplechase, also run at
Aintree, last November, and is owned by
W. H. Midwood.
* * * *
“Thormanby’’: The English flat racing
season, which should take on added interest
this year by reason of Strephon’s debut on
old-country courses opened last week with
the Lincolnshire Handicap over a mile.
Leonidas 11., a French-bred horse, by Teddy
from Helen de Troie, an Irish mare by
Helicon and owned by M. M- Boussac, won
from a field of BO others, going out at the
nice quote of 60 to 1. Strephon, by the way,
has been handed top weight, 9st., for his
first appearance in the Kempton Park Jubilee
Stakes on May 17. This means he has to
concede 91b. to nags like Athford, one of the
best handicappers of last season.
* * * *
R. M. Hawker, one of South Australia’s
best-known pastoralists and racing men,
died in Adelaide the other day, as the result
of a motor accident. He had decided to
live permanently in England, and recently
sold his Morphettville stud. He won many
races during his long connection with the
South Australian Tui-f, among them being
the S.A.J.C. Derby with Tiercel in 1908, the
same horse landing the City Handicap for
him a couple of years later. Another good
one owned by him was Megdalia, which W.
H. McLachlan piloted home in the Adelaide
Cup of 1910.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Another hard slogging bout at Sydney
Stadium saw J. Peai'ce, of Newcastle
(N.S.W.) score a convincing win over Ted
Monson, whom he stopped in the twelfth.
Venomous punching by the winner was the
main feature of the scrap, and despite the
fact that Monson is a glutton for punish-
ment, he took enough hard thumps to satisfy
even him. His recent hard battle with Jack
Haines appeared to have slowed Monson up,
and, although lie fought well in the early
rounds, the tide set against him from the
eighth. Solid right and left swings to tiie
face by Pearce and a right uppercut cracked
the loser up. He was done to a turn when
a weighty wallop floored him for nine, and
he was reeling and groggy when the referee
stepped in and crowned Pearce. Pearce
scaled lOst. 31b. and Monson list. 21b.
Footbrawl
“Ilotham”: The Victorian Rugby Union
celebrated the fourth season of its resur-
rection the other day. The game is growing
steadily, if quietly, in the head centre of
Australian Rules, though the balance-sheet
showed a debit. “A” grade musters six
teams, including one from University. The
lack of an enclosed ground is the great han-
dicap, but the Melbourne C. C. ground has
been secured for the match against the
British side, from which it is hoped many
shekels will accrue.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Sydney University Rugby
Club, one of the oldest in Australia, has
resolved to scrap the blue and gold barred
jersey its players have worn for over 50
years. Reasons are not given, but in view
of the fact that all sorts of weird games
within the University are now claiming the
honor of the famous colors, they are not;
hard to guess at. The new uniform will be
a white jersey with the Union badge on the
breast. As one of those present at the meeting
which decided on the change remai-ked rue-
fully, “What’ll it look like after a wet-day
game on Uni. Oval?” If there is a worse
wet-day ground in Australia than that same
oval, writer hasn’t seen it.
* * * *
“Everton”: North and South will meet in
the Anal of the famous old British Associa-
tion “Coop” at Weihbley, on April 26.
Huddersfield Town, a comparative upstart in
cup circles from Yorkshire, and runner-up
to Blackburn Rovers in 1928, will dispute
the issue with Arsenal, which, because its
full title is Woolwich Arsenal, is fondly
supposed by many supporters to be a Govern-
ment institution. Arsenal is renowned for
the money'it spends in purchasing players,
in spite of the fact that its record in the
Cup is a very poor one. This year its team
has been valued at over £30,000 cost price,
not bad for a flock or herd of 11 men.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Three Maoriland foot-
ballers who signed up with the Lancashire
Rugby League club, St. Helens, have found
out that the path of a professional foot-
baller in England is not strewn with roses.
The jobs found for them in addition to
cash payments have not panned out as pro-
mised. They requested that the terms of their
engagement be carried out, including a
guaranteed benefit of £250 each, and were
promptly placed on the shelf. As their cash
allowance ceases automatically with their sus-
pension, the trio may find themselves in an
awkward fix so far away from home, unless
they can make peace with their employers.
# * * :J:
“Glenelg”: South Australia’s football
selectors for the season are E, 11. Tassie,
11. W. Tomkins and R. S. Beatty. The last
two are new to the thankless job. Mayor of
Ilindmarsh Tomkins is secretary of West
Torrens cricket and football clubs. His
brother neophyte, Beatty, is a schoolmaster
and a well-known Sturt official, being now
secretary of the club. He has been a player
of note with Sturt, like three of his brothers,
and though war service, which brought him
the D.C.M. and M.M., interefei*ed somewhat
with his football, he was a member of the
team which won the premiership in 1919.
* * * *
“Port”: South Australians at least are
darned glad that the Victorian football autho-
rities have shut down on the purchase of
football players from other Australian Rules
States. For some years past it has hardly
been possible for a South Australian club to
keep a promising youngster, Victorian buyers
coming hotfoot to buy him at the first sign nf
outstanding football capacity, while N.S.W.
has complained of the same conditions in
a lesser degree. Under the new rules (B.
19/3/’3O) no one will be able to play foot-
ball in Victoria without working for his
living as well —a drastic change.

’Ave I done much with ’orses?

M Der Jong” : The news that South Africa
intends to invite an Australian Rugby .team
to tour the Union in the 1931 season hardly
comes as a surprise, for the Springboks have
been coquetting with the idea for some time.
As the Australians will have had the best
possible tuning-up in their matches with the
British team in Australia, the tour should
be an outstanding success, and go far to
settle the question of the world’s Rugby
championship, which Maoriland and the
Afrikanders both claim. South Africa plays
the old-fashioned solid game, making the
most of tight forward work. This fact will
have to be borne in mind when the speed-
obsessed Australian selectors face the task
of choosing the Waratah side.
* * * *
“Hooker”: Followers of G.P.S. Rugby in
N.S.W. and Queensland have been disap-
pointed at the decision to postpone the visit
of the Canadian High Schools’ team, which
was to have figured in Australia this year.
The Canucks were crowded out by the
British visit, but will come this way the
following season. Not much is known of
Canadian form on this side of the Pacific,
and there has been no regular series of
international games between the Dominion
and British sides to take as a guide. The
games played by Australian and All Black
sides at Vancouver and elsewhere have proved
easy for the touring teams, and the Cana-
dian schoolboys will be up against high-class
opposition in their G.P.S. matches here.
* * * *
“Birkenhead Park”: When the Premier of
France the other day ordered his military
superiors to grant the necessary leave to a
poiln who was wanted to play against Eng-
land in the Rugby international at Twicken-
ham, it was felt .a precedent had been
created. It was soon followed. Hearing that
the three Army and Air Force players selec-
ted to accompany the British Rugby team
to M.L. and Australia had been refused
leave, King George himself stepped in with
a request for reconsideration, and as a result
the trio is now free to go. George Rex, like
Prince Ned, is a keen Rugby barracker and
generally does his bit at the Twickenham
matches.
* * * *
“Murrayfield”: The inclusion of only one
Scot in the coming British Rugby team is
probably due to the Scottish Union’s dis-
approval of “colonials” and all their ivorks.
Caledonia has been sterner and wilder since
it made the mistake of refusing to share
the gate with the first All Blacks, demand-
ing a guaranteed payment instead. The
greatest crowd ever gathered at a Scottish
international sent the Maorilanders away
loaded down with money, Scotland getting
only about a third of what she might have
pouched. The Union across the Tweed did
not actually forbid its players to go. It
refused to have anything to do with the
tour, and registered disapproval. Most of
the Thistle-wearers seem to have taken the
hint.
* * * *
“Pliocene”: Among pessimists the foot-
ball variety takes high rank, and the player
of a past generation is everlastingly bewail-
ing the decadent state of the game and the
players as he views both to-day. Maori-
land’s recent experiences in South Africa
and Australia have increased the tendency,
always noticeable across the Tasman. The
latest Jeremiah is Charley Brown, who skip-
pered the M.L. Army side in South Africa.
Charles has forecast the utter extinction of
All Black sides by the Britons this season,
and bases his belief on the falling away from
grace of M.L. forwards. There is room for
hope, however, as no British side has ever got
away with much bacon from the Shivery
Isles, and history will probably repeat itself.
* * * *
“Gate”: N.S.W. Rugby League is sorry
for itself. There was a loss of over £2OOO
on the season, which was bad enough.
Further it has realised that in championing
the Brisbane R. L. against the Queensland
body it has backed the wrong horse. Then its
munificent patron Joynton Smith, who gave
the professional code its first start in life
financially, suddenly resigned, and is, at
time of writing, being beseeclied to return to
the throne. Worse than all is the realisation
that unless it eats its own words, and, after
repudiating the Brisbane League, again takes
the State organisation to its bosom, the
annual matches with Queensland, which
supply most of the League profits, may go
up in smoke. The Queensland League has
the funds and the players of note. Inter-
State games between Noo Smith and the
new “Queensland” League which is being
formed by Brisbane will draw no money, and
that’s a horrible prospect for a professional
organisation to face.
* * * *
“Fitzscray”: Syd Barker, who heard the
last whistle blow in Melbourne, the other
day, was a prominent figure in Victorian
football for a generation. Beginning with
North Melbourne in the Association days, he
was prominent as a rucker and became
skipper of the side. Later he made his
weight felt with Essendon, and when the
club won the League premiership in 1923
the veteran’s play and captaincy were largely
responsible. When North Melbourne joined
the League a couple of seasons ago, Barker
went back to his old love, as coach and
general adviser. A man of strong person-
ality, he was a great favorite.
* * * *
“Rover”: The annual meeting of the
N.S.W. Australian Football League dis-
closes the same old deficiency in the cash-
box. Increased expenditure on schools and
juniors is largely responsible, but the fact
that in the Sydney area the League has to
play its competitions year after year on
grounds only partially enclosed probably
has a great deal to do with its inability to
make headway, in spite of the enthusiasm
and hard work of its officials. It might
almost pay the League better to concentrate
on the Australian football section of N.S.W.
along the Victorian border than to make
Sydney, largely given over to other codes,
its headquarters.
The Watermen
“Torrens” : South Australian oarsmen, and
particularly the country section, are wrath
with the selection of the eight to row in the
King's Cup race at Mannum. General
opinion was that the Torrens crew picked
itself, since it has cleaned up all opposition
in sight for some time past. The selectors
were asked to permit a test race to find out
whether or no their crew was the real
Maginnis, but they have diplomatically
declined, much to the scornful disgust of the
intransigeants.
*** • *
“Toowong”: Brisbane rowing club’s cup
of bitterness slopped over when
the new eight, which had cost £145, was
badly broken up in a collision with a four.
The latter, and another which went to lend
a hand were also seriously damaged. Some
time ago the club shed was burned to the
ground, and after carrying the hat round
for a long time an expensive new one was
erected. Then the City Council hopped in
and resumed the site on which the building-
stood for bridge approaches, and coughed
up only £2O in compensation. Members
are now waiting for the next slings and
arrows of blanky fortune.
“Hamilton”: One of the finest amateur
scullers Australia has produced shipped his
oar in Brisbane when “Mick” Slack passed
out the other day. Winner of the first Aus-
tralian champion sculls in 1892, he repeated
the feat in 1896 and 1900, and in addition
won numerous State and regatta champion-
ships and trophies. A long raking stylist,
he was ideally equipped for sculling, and
his employment as a carcase-butcher in the
Graziers’ Butchering Co. kept him in fine
trim. Incidentally, he held what is claimed
as a world’s record for dressing a bullock —
4i minutes. That was at Grafton (N.S.W.)
in 1889. He was only 62 when the sudden
end came.

“Chevroford” : The Australian Grand Prix,
run on Phillip Island (Vic.) on March 24,
is the only road race of its kind in Australia.
The rural council and island traders know
who butters their bread, and the 61-mile
track is tended as carefully as a first baby.
Over 20 cars of all makes started in three
divisions on the 200-mile run, and the
improvements to the turns at the four
corners, named respectively Hell, Heaven,
Gentle Anne and Young and Jackson’s led
to swifter times, a Bugatti heading ’em with
olir. 6min. Three Austins finished one, two
and three in the mosquito class, the first
being driven by R. C. Dickason. That fine
driver G. Dentry, with his wife aboard as
mechanic, won the “B” division with a Riley
Nine. W. Thompson, of N.S.W., took the
Grand Prix and first prize in “C” class
with his supercharged 1946-c.c. Bugatti.
Thompson’s average for the 202.98 miles
actually covered was 04.5 m.p.h. and his
time bettered the race record by Smin. 22sec.
* * * *
“Formula”: A Chrysler has cracked all
previous endurance records. The test was
held on the Avus motor track near Berlin,
and after the car had been travelling 69 days
and nights it ran off the road in a fog, and
called it a day. The run covered 53,711 miles
with no stops except to refuel, etc., the
engine going all the time. There were three
crews driving in six-hour shifts, and the
average speed including halts, was 31 m.p.h.
—a rattling good all-round performance.
* =i: * *
“Pore du Chemin”; Another miracle has
happened in that the latest Sydney to Mel-
bourne motor-car rush has entailed no fatali-
ties to the general public which uses the
roads upon which these self-advertising stunts
are put up. This titae the 576 miles was
covered at a rate of 70 m.p.h. right through.
Hitherto most of the idiotic performances
have been done in ordinary type cars. The
one used on this occasion was stripped and
re-conditioned until it was practically a
track racing-car. The police of Victoria and
N.S.W. have repeatedly stated their inten-
tion of stopping these freak runs, and the
automobile clubs of the two States have been
fervent to the same effect for some years
pa’st. So far police and clubs have displayed
the activity of a dead jellyfish in this con-
nection.
* * * #
“B.” : Though there were no serious acci-
dents on the Phillip Island (Vic.) Grand
Prix. of the 24 entrants only 9 finished
inside the 44 hours limit. Casualties were
heaviest amongst the taxis, three of
which were bowled over groping their way
home with headlights on through a fog of
dust thicker than a London particular. Fully
10,000 crossed over to see the event, a large
number of them, incidentally, being carried
in the yacht King Edward presented to
Lily Langtry. It now goes under the alias
of Alvena.

“Von Sprindt”: That motor-cycle record
by the German rider Ilenne (B. 19/3/’3O)
has been recognised as 134.68 m.p.h., and now
stands on the books. C. Temple, the famous
English rider and holder of most of the m.c.
CECIL WALKER, the Australian cyclist,
who for some years past has been a
champion rider in America and Europe.
records, is out to regain this one. He is
having a special machine built by the J.A.P.
people with a four-cylinder supercharged
engine of 1000-c.c. capacity. The German’s
figures are nearly 15 m.p.h. better than his
own best.
* * * *
“Manx”: Australia’s only Tourist Trophy
race for motor-cycles will be run off on a
40-mile circuit in the Goulburn (N.S.W.)
district on April 19. There will be three
sections, including one for side-cars, and in
view of the many left-hand corners on the
course, the side-car race may be run clock-
wise, in the opposite direction to that used
in the last races. It is yet to be decided, too,
whether the Isle of Man style of starting
competitors at half-minute intervals will be
adhered to, or the Continental practice of
letting the whole field go in a bunch. The
latter makes it much easier for spectators to
follow a race over a distance.

“Richmond”: The go between Hubert
Opperman and “Fatty” Lamb over 10 miles

fellow Victorian in 12.25 4-ssec. It was
the first meeting- of the pair in Victoria since
Lamb returned from America, and the time
has been beaten by both riders on other
occasions. In addition it is nearly half a
minute slower than Frank Corrie’s Australian
record. However, the crowd was provided
with nice thrills, the riders taking turn about
to assume the lead. If there was any betting
on the running, the odds must have been easy
to estimate.
* * * *
“Sprocket” : Though Victorian cyclists had
experience of something of the sort in the
Dunlop Grand Prix of a couple of years ago,
Australian riders generally are sighing for a
contest on Tour de France lines. N.S.W. pro-
fessionals are advocating a round-N.S.W.
race, in which teams from different centres
will compete against each other, as the
individual riders and teams do in the famous
Continental event. There are some 30 cycling
centres affiliated with the State professional
body, and most of these are expected to enter.
The course, not yet mapped out, is expected
to range somewhere between the Tweed and
the Murray in one direction, and Sydney and
Milparinka in the other. There’s plenty of
room for all.

“Coventry”: A great amateur cyclist of
other days passed out last week when Leon
Meredith died of heart failure in Switzerland
at the early age of 48. He won the 100
kilometres amateur motor-paced championship
of the world seven times, and among his
British triumphs were the five miles (1904
and 1905), the 25 miles (1903 and 1908) and
the 50 miles in 1902 and 1907. He was a
great rider on track and road alike, and was
the first Englishman to cover 100 miles
on the road out and home unpaced under
five hours. He was credited with having
won more world’s championships under all
conditions of cycling than any other rider,
amateur or professional.

age snapped in England the other day, when
Mrs. W. G. Grace, relict of the mighty doc-
tor, died at 76. As a bride she accompanied
W.G. on his first visit to Australia in 1873.
Of the players who figured in that team all
are gone. The last survivor was James Lilly-
white. His innings was declared closed last
year.
* * * *
“‘Swan”: The departed Australian Eleven
had an easy win by an innings and 25 runs
over Westralia at Perth, a’Beckett and Grim-
mett dividing bowling honors in the two
W.A. innings, while ’keeper Walker stumped
or caught eight batsmen. For the first time
since 1890 a left-hand batsman of note is
absent from the team, and the Englishmen
are already congratulating themselves on the
fact. Beginning in 1893, mollyhanders of
good to better standard who have made the
trip are: W. Bruce, Arthur Coniugham, J.
Darling, Clem Hill, W. Bardsley, Vernon
Ransford and Jack Gregory.

“8.K.”: Concerning Melbourne tennis (B.
26/3/’3O), it will hardly be believed, but
Thomas Stone, the Melbourne club’s first
professional, played the game for 70 years.
He taught King Edward, and is reputed to
be the only man who habitually swore at
that monarch with impunity. His son is
the club’s present instructor. During Oscar
Asche’s last theatrical season, that fat
histrion used to play a daily game in order
to reduce his magnitude. He always brought
along his cook and chef and the famous
portable cooker he invented to repair the
ravages of excessive perspiration. Tennis
is probably the most strenuous game there
is, and its exponents regard the ordinary
or lawn variety as sissies.
* * *
“Ride Off”: When the N.S.W. polo player
Curtis Skene was rated an 8-goal man
by the American polo authorities recently,
some surprise was expressed by Australian
players, for, good as he is, there are several
in N.S.W. alone whom experts would class
as better. However, W. Cooley, America’s
leading authority on the subject, has recently
written that the Australian is one of the
finest polo horsemen he has ever seen, and
that with three others of his ability Aus-
tralia could hold its own with the cream
of American polo—on present performance,
the world’s best.
* H-- sis *
“James Pigg”: Fox-hunting of a type
calculated to revolve the late lamented Jor-
rocks rapidly in his grave was seen in
Sydney the other day. The “fox,” a baby
car with a feather duster sticking out behind
for a “brush,” was given a start in Sydney
Domain, and then pack and field, all in
cars, enthusiastically pursued it through the
environs of the burg, the “hounds” giving
tongue more or less melodiously with motor-
horns. The going over the suburban roads
is said to have be.en very sporting, while the
frantic efforts of pedestrians to avoid de-
struction at the wheels of pack and field
added to the zest of the run. The fox was
run into at North Sydney, the brush being
handed over to the first up with traditional
ceremony.
* * * *
“Hotham” : Victorian bowling circles have
been perturbed of late over the development
of barracking at matches. One or two scenes
lately verged on the disgraceful, and it is
feared that the time is at hand when mounted
police will have to be stationed on the greens
as at the football matches. One preventive
measure suggested is that the club bars
should be closed during games of the kind.
Such a blow at the very foundation of bowls,
however, could not be entertained for a
moment, and the suggestion has been dis-
missed as insidious propaganda in the local
prohibition interests.
* * * *
“Splash”: Another of these American
flappers has been putting up swimming times
which suggest that she must have been fitted
with an outboard motor. Helen Madison is
her name, and 1G her years. A few days
ago she cracked six world’s records in one
afternoon, practically wiping the figures of
Gertrude Ederle and Martha Norelius off the
slate, while Edna Davey’s world’s figures for
the 200 yards were beaten by 12 3-ssec. As
her improvement on the other times from
220 to 500 yards was equally marked, it is
evident the young lady is dashed fast, or
American watches are getting slower than
ever.
* * * *
“Awaroa” : Maoriland, which has elevated
shark-catching to a “big game” sport, has
introduced a new technique. A couple of
horsemen riding along the beach near Nelson
saw a large shark in a four-feet-deep lagoon
wherein the tide had left it. Aided by their
dog they rode in and attacked it with hastily
improvised weapons. The shark ducked in
and out between the horses’ legs, but in spite
of a lot of snapping left the nags unharmed
until it was at last dispatched. The only
casualty was the dog, which grabbed the
shark by one fin, and lost a quantity of skin
and hair to his opponent. If the new sport
takes on it may extend the horse’s sphere
of usefulness. There are thousands on the
pony courses and elsewhere fitted for shark-
baiting, and nothing else.
* * * *
“Hotham” : The brotherly love that mostly
doesn’t exist between N.S.W. and trans-
Murray sportsmen got another dint over the
recent inter-State water-polo games. The
series was played in Yarraville, and when
the defeated Cornstalks returned to the
Harbor what some of them said about the
Vic. tactics and the umpiring curdled the
limpid waters of that famous pond. Vic-
toria has come back with counter-charges
of attempted murder, barratry, piracy on
the. high seas and the deuce knows what
beside. It clinched its rebuttal with the
barbed comment that though the visitors had
been allowed to chose their own umps. in
the third game, they couldn’t even win that.

I was recently privileged to see over
one of the largest of Australia’s canneries,
the cleanliness of which was remarkable.
But still more remarkable was the fact
that over 90 per cent, of the machinery
used was built in Australia. The cans
and glassware were locally made near
the factory. All cases were made from
Australian timber, nailed with Australian
nails. Labels were printed in Australia
with Australian-made printing ink. In
fact, this one factory causes, by. its policy
of buying its requirements here, em-
ployment in almost every Stdte of
Australia —and of course helps many
other manufacturers.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Have you
ordered
Kraft Cheese?
The Fashions that are to bloom in the
spring. On the other side of the world suede
gloves are definitely in for evening wear.
Twenty-four-button length, and your really
well-groomed woman arrives at the party
with at least one spare pair tucked in her
bag! Moisture affects suede unpleasantly.
When her partner retires to slip on that
extra collar he has brought, the lady can
withdraw to button on new gloves, after she
has somewhat pensively drawn on the extra
pair of hose she has also smuggled in. What
to do with the discarded glove and sock is
as great a problem as what to do with the
stone in the olive. Cloak-room attendants
must become so overburdened with chiffon
silk hose and shoulder-length gloves that they
would probably get to the stage of scorn-
fully shrugging refusal.
Paris is bringing back lace mittens. Lace
is a prominent feature of the new _ styles,
and in many of the best frocks showing the
tiny puff sleeve the old-fashioned mit is quite
in the picture.
Evening frocks are instep- or ankle-length.
The trains of yesteryear occur very seldom ;
the backs of these just brush the floor in-
stead of trailing on it. Sports and town
costumes are sensibly 13 to 15 inches from
the floor. Afternoon frocks for formal wear
fluctuate between 11 inches from the floor
and ankle-length.
Belts and gloves must match, and so must
shoes and bags. Straw laces are to be worn,
with shoes of the same material —visca thread
combined with hemp are worked into lacy
designs, and the surface is a contrast in
shiny and dull effects. These shoes are .in
both pastel and high colors or in white reaJy
to be dyed the required shade. Hair sports-
shoes in ombre stripes are included in the
knut’s wardrobe.
Lilac, mauves, pinks and blues are tipped
as the summer favorites.
There is a distinct swing away from the
barbaric in some choker necklaces seen by
this Letter last week. One was an almost
fragrant affair of bluebells and tiny hedge-
roses. Hand-painted crystal was the material
used, and the bells, a thick peal of them,
were strung on a fine rope of silver thread,
and the roses smiled here and there as
though by chance. Another was our old
friend Sweet William; still another was of
crystal loganberries, the leaf of the berry
lying flat against the throat. Another was
of amber berries with leaf to tone.
Elizabeth Bay and Darling Point are busy
getting up a present for the Viking’s lady.
And quite right, too. Those parts enjoy
the hospitality of Government House much
more than do even the wives of State Minis-
ters ; and if Lady de Chair’s women friends
decide, instead of buying her expensive indi-
vidual gifts, to pool their resources and give
her one from the lot of them, isn’t that a
commendable idea?
The De Chairs have been amiable and very
accessible people—would have remained the
simple-minded, not a bit conceited family
they were on their arrival in Sydney if the
censer of adulation had not been kept con-
stantly a-swing under their nostrils. If for
five years a family is daily given to under-
stand that it harbors poets, artists, actors,
writers and statesmen amid its members, you
can hardly be surprised if at the end of the
time it accepts some of it as gospel. That
the De Chairs have not become unbearable
speaks volumes for the sound underlying
commonsense of the family.
The Country Women’s Association handed
Lady de Chair a loving-cup in silver gilt,
glittersome on one side with her initials in
diamonds and sapphires, and with the C.W.A.
crest on the other. Mrs. Matt Sawyer, who
passed on the bauble on behalf of the C.W.A.,
pointed out —for the edification of the press-
women, or it may be the burglars—that the
affair isn’t as golden as it glitters, and cost
the donors only two bob a head. Lady de
Chair dropped a few appropriate tears into
the cup and said how grieved she was to say
good-bye, adding that she had asked Mrs.
Sawyer to explain the low cost of the vice-
regal gift owing to a misunderstanding about
another presentation that was being made
to her. A book illustrating the good works
of the C.W.A. was part of the presentation,
which took place amid the loud applause
of a great and friendly audience in the draw-
ing-room of the Australia.
If ever Lady de Chair wants to know
what the flag of almost any nation is like,
she won’t have to turn, as most of us have
to do, to old Noah Webster. She will be
able to consult her own private collection,
many of them hand-worked. The Y.VV.C.A.
farewell party has made this possible, for to
it, at the instigation of president Miss
Fowler, the wife of every consul in Sydney
brought a miniature flag of the country
represented by her husband. Lady de Chair
placed each little standard about the basket
of flowers that had been presented to ner.
The effect against her period frbek of
powder-blue satin was spirited and vivid.
Lady Grizel Hamilton held the Vicereine s
hand during the little ceremonial. Then came
the speeches, cast, as befits the widely flung
activities of the Y.W-C.A., in an interna-
tional mould.
An army of Diggers’ wives, mothers,
widows and other relations took possession
of the Civil Service Stores the other after-
noon and gave Lady de Chair the equivalent
of three cheers for her help to those soldier
groups whose work it is to soften the suf-
ferings and privations of ex-Billjims and
their dependants. Mrs. May Mercer and
Mrs. Connell glowed with the warmth of
the eulogy they paid, and Billy Hughes’s
dame also handed out a verbal testimonial.
Presently Mrs. E. J. Walsh and Mrs. Malley
bustled up bearing a tray carved with Aus-
tralian wild flowers ; and with it a bouquet
of very real-looking waratalis, flannel-
flowers and Christmas-bush modelled in
sealing-wax by Mrs. Ratcliffe, one of the
oldest members of the Soldiers’ Relatives
and Victory Association. Probably the
youngest musician who has ever tuned up
for her delight serenaded the Governor’s
lady at this party. He was Robert Brown,
a grandson of Mrs. May Mercer’s, and he
was paid, as all artists should be, with
cakes and ale —or a kiddy’s equivalent
thereof.
Herewith a Dayne picture of Margaret
Macarthur Onslow, whose wedding with
Michael King, of the 9th Royal Deccan
Horse, India,
is likely to
stir up stories
connected
with Gover-
nor Bligh and
one of the
oldest families
in the State.
Margaret is
the daughter
of the Arthur
Onslows, of
M'acquarie
Grove, Cam-
den, and old
St. John’s
church in
that village
will be decor-
ated for her
wedding on
Empire Day.
The feast will
be spread at
Camden Park, the headquarters of the clan,
which is at present reigned over by Miss
Sibella Macarthur Onslow, aunt of the bride-
to-be. The wedding frock is to be in golden
tones, and so are the frocks of the brides-
maids, Faith Macarthur Onslow and Morna
MacCormick. «...
Not for 11 years has there been a Mac-
arthur Onslow bride. Then Helen, daughter
of the General and his lady, became the
wife of Captain Stanham, then A.D.C. to
Governor Davidson, and now- stationed at
Aldershot. That wedding took place on a
sunny morning in late winter in a little
church on the Onslow property at Menangle.
A special gold pen was used to sign the
register, and the church was festive with
white-ribboned pews. There were bowls of
arum lilies at the foot of the church and
narcissi on the altar. A cousin, the Rev.
Cecil King, helped tie the knot, cousin Anita
played the small harmonium, and the bride’s
brother Jim sang “O Perfect Love.” It was
a Saturday wedding, and in the afternoon
the whole of the tenantry were hieing them
to the feast spread by the family in honor
of Squire’s daughter and her ’groom. The
then G.-G.’s wife, Lady Helen Munro Fer-
guson, whose gift was a black ostrich feather
fan, was a guest, and the present bride was
a small bridesmaid, mostly white georgette
and pink carnations.
The Victoria League’s good-bye to Sir
Dudley and Lady de Chair stands out as
the best-dressed party of the week. The
League’s member's are all in the class that
can hear without blenching that 24-button
suede gloves are to be once more the correct
wear after six .o’clock. Among the groups
of Church, State and public-spirited some-
bodies who thronged David Jones’s ballroom
the other night were seen many snow-white
furlongs of white kids, but only one pair of
suede. Lady de Chair was in sky-blue
moires, afire with rhinestones, a touch of
warmth added to her raiment by a posy of
damask roses. The impressive Miss Mac-
arthur Onslow always does the honors at
the League celebrations, and she brought
into Friday night's picture the rich lustre of
gold raiment. Sir Dudley and Miss Onslow
made happy speeches, and Professor Mungo
MacCallum wasn’t outdone in verbiculture.
Dame Mary Cook, in modish pink moires, and
Chief Justice Street’s lady, in black and
silver, were others of the mighty.
Sir Philip and Lady Game, who are due
to arrive by the Moldavia on May 29, intend
that their eldest son, who was about to
enter Woolwich, shall attend the Sydney
Uni., while their second boy will go to
a grammar school not yet specified. Their
religion, for all those who are interested,
is C. of E. So the Anglican Cathedral
will now be the social storm-centre on the
Sabbath morn. This Letter has not yet
discovered the size of the lady’s shoes or of
the new Excellency’s shirt-collars. But these
Imperial facts shall be forthcoming in the
near future.
Bonnie Appleton’s name describes her.
You can judge for yourself by this Rene
Pardon picture. But Bonnie has brains,
too, and,
although not
very long
from Fren-
sham, she is
one of the
most promis-
ing of J.C.W.'s
young artists.
She has a
small but very
good part in
“The Prince
and the
Pauper,” and
had quite a
success in
“Bird in
Hand.” Her
sister Pearl,
who walked
straight on to
the boards
from school
and made a
great hit with her little Irish maid in “Old
English” and later still as the dream child
in “Dear Brutus,” is now in New York
playing in a Broadway comedy, “The Second
Mrs. Fraser.” The clever pair are the
daughters of Mrs. C. W. Pfeiffer, of Elizabeth
Bay.
After two postponements you might have
thought the welcome home bv the committee
of the Limbless Soldiers’ Association to Chief
Justice Street’s lady would have been a
failure. Actually, it was one of the week-end
successes. The Narkunda staged the affair
sumptuously ; the P. and O. Co. gave ship,
supper and music, so the workers in a good
cause felt they combined a neat bit of shear-
ing of the G.P. and a recognition of their
president in the one process. Mrs. Kenneth
Street, in flowered taffetas, swept the deck,
very new as to silhouette, and acted as a
sort of hostess of the royal barge in company
with Mrs. W, A. Mackay, who glittered in
cloth of gold. Secretary Mrs. G. C. Berge
and the Narkunda’s commander, Captain J.
Parker, and ball-treasurer R. Clarke were
others who glad-handed prominent arrivals.
The Governor and Lady de Chair, daughter
Elaine and son Graham turned up in shining-
armor, and the guest-in-chief trailed claret-
colored chiffons. The supper tables were
beautiful with flowers from the North Shore
garden of Mr. O. Byers.
Fred Broomfield and birdlover A. H. Chis-
holm are a pipe the richer since the birthday
party given in their honor by the Fellowship
of Australian Writers. This was a matey
affair, held in the Lyceum Club, and owed
much of its success to secretary Marjorie
Quinn, who floated about in ethereal blue
tulle bearing bouquets to Mab Fothering-
hame, who sang an Australian lullaby by
Sammie Ryan, to Mary Gilmore, who read
her own poem, “The Little Drum,” and to
Clem Robertson, who interpreted the verse
of several Australian writers. President Le
Gay Brereton was tied up at the Uni., and
George Mackaness, who took his place, pro-
posed the toast of the three winners of the
Bulletin Novel Competition.
Mrs. Taylor, the winner of the second
prize (£250), intends to dedicate her story to
Mary Gilmore when it gets into book-covers
—this in recognition of the many years of
sympathetic service with which Mrs, Gil-
more has striven to brighten the lives of
bush women.
“Wards of the Outer March,” Mrs. Tay-
lor’s fine story, is so strikingly well suited
for woman’s reading that the “Mirror” put
in an urgent requisition for it; and the
first chapters of it will be printed in that
paper on April 15 —the day before The
Bulletin begins Vance Palmer’s. “The Pas-
sage.” The “Woman’s Mirror” will then be
publishing simultaneously the two most
expensive serials ever offered by a woman’s
paper in the Southern Hemisphere—Mrs.
Taylor’s novel and “Earth Battles,” by
Dorothy Cottrell, the writer of “Sing-ing
Gold,” the story which won the $5OOO prize
offered two years ago by the “Ladies’ Home
Journal” in U.S.A.
Pretty, ethereal-looking Jean Curlewis died
last week in a private hospital in Macleay-
street. She had been one of Australia’s
youngest novelists: it is a good many years
since her “Ship That Never Set Sail” was
published. Jean had a delicate fancy, and was
just the sort of daughter one would have ex-
pected her mother, Ethel Turner, to have. The
Judge and Mrs. Curlewis and her husband,
Leonard Charlton, have the sympathy not
only of Australia but of many people in many
countries whose children have greeted with
delight Ethel Turner's young heroes and
heroines. Five years ago a Norwegian
writer told this Letter that Ethel Turner
was the only Australian woman writer trans-
lated into the language of his country.
A story ran round last week that the
Rabbi had witnessed a rehearsal of a wedding
ceremony and had ordered alterations to be
made in various frocks. xne bottom was
blown out of the story afterwards, but
whispers helped to fill the Synagogue with
a crowd more curious than devout. The bride
was Lilian Ross, of Vaucluse, dewy as a
rose in pale petal pink satin and Limerick
lace, and the ’groom William Lieberman, of
Randwick. During the always picturesque
Jewish wedding ceremonial the crowd got out
of hand, and clambered on to the seats and
into the aisles; and when the 17-year-old
bride, on her husband’s arm, and her eight
rosebud attendants (four in hedgerose and
four in Malmaison satin) made for the door,
it was a hard struggle to get them through.
Mr. and Mrs. David Ross, of Vaucluse, the
bride’s parents, afterwards entertained over
300 guests at David Jones’s.
Marjorie Dixon-lludson, one of the city’s
most promising girl architects, having made
plans for a villa for two, asked the blessing
of her father, Padre Dixon-lludson, of Ilurst-
ville, on the foundations thereof, and on her
partner in the undertaking, Reginald Hol-
royde. Reginald’s father, who was a padre
also, held a cure of souls at Bromley in
Kent. St. Andrew’s Cathedral echoed sono-
rously to the choral service, and Dean Talbot
helped bride’s father tie the knot, while her
brother, Dr. Kingsley Dixon-lludson, from
Bungendore, handed her to the lucky man.
White chiffon and satin enwrapped the prin-
cipal, and sister Ella paced after her in pint-
velvet shoes surmounted by pink georgette and
a cerulean-blue felt hat. Toasts were drained
at the Arts Club.
Dorothy Margaret Beardsmore, of Croydon,
is the champion woman skier of this State,
so the patches of thin ice that matrimony
holds have no terrors for her. She became
the bride of Leo. C. Gelling, of Manly, him-
self swift and sure on the skis, at St. Vin-
cent’s, in Ashfield. The bride wore ivory
satin of classic cut sown thick with pearls,
while a tulle veil like a mist on Kosciusko
floated about her. Sisters Sadie, Kathleen
and Florence, an attractive trio in cherry
red and apple green, were in the procession.
Congratulations at the Ambassadors.
Probably no woman in Sydney is more
public-spirited, if public-spirited means being
attached to public bodies, than Mrs. Ber-
nard Muscio. Even in the movement which
the' psychologists call our “wool conscious-
ness” Mrs. Muscio has a finger—she is one
of the two women on the executive com-
mittee for the projected wool week. How-
ever, the industry will have to get along
without her, for by that time the busy lady
will be off to the quinquennial meeting of
the International Council of Women, which
is to set Vienna by the heels from May
26 to June 7. Mrs. Muscio is not only State
president of the National Council, but the
council’s Federal president, and so she heads
the delegation from Australia. National
Councillors last week farewelled their spokes-
woman in David Jones’s auditorium, and did
it over the immemorial dish of tea. Carl
Budden Morris played Chopin, Winifred
.Tenner unleashed her contralto, and Kath-
leen Jordan supplied the accompaniments
thereto, and the afternoon was music-filled as
well as flower-fragrant. Ruby Board, who
will act as president in Mrs. Muscio’s
absence, Mrs. F. L. Cohen and Mrs. Far-
quharson were the afternoon’s hostesses.
Enid Colin Rodgers is flashing a diamond
and sapphire ring. She is just back from
Melbourne, where she has been meeting her
Warwick Pett’s people. They are the Fred
Petts, of Vermont (Vic.) and Berkshire
(Eng.). Warwick is an only son, Enid an
only daughter. Her people are the Colin
Rodgers, of Cheddington, Woollahra.
Apropos the paragraph about Australian
gum-trees being used in reafforestation work
in Palestine, a correspondent mentions that,
though the eucalyptus is used, cedar, oak and
olive types predominate. Collections in
Jewish homes for tree-planting to celebrate a
mitzvah (joyous occasion) is, oiir friend
adds, the revival of an ancient custom —the
people of Israel used to mark the birth of
a boy by planting a cedar and that of a girl
by planting a pine; and when the child had
grown to manhood or womanhood, the wood
of these trees were used to furnish the poles
of the wedding canopy.

DARYL: LINDSAY
Synopsis : Boyd McGurdie had
left Abernethy station before the
war to study law in Sydney, where
he enlisted. His mother had been dead
some years, and his father had proposed
marrying again. Also, old McGurdie's
dominating energy had rather over-
whelmed him. McGurdie married, but
his young wife never became quite re-
conciled to station life. McGurdie, who
had represented his electorate in Par-
liament, had lost the seat over too-
pronounced utterances during the
war, and financial troubles had made
him sell out various station and other
interests and concentrate on Aber-
nethy. The story begins with him
anxiously awaiting Boyd's return after
years at the war. At Abernethy
Boyd feels influences at work to
hold him to the station. He meets
again Josie Duncan, who has black
blood in her and is the home-
stead housemaid. Also, he is visited
by Barbara Mahon—as she formerly
was. She has married during Boyd's
absence a doctor named Day, and is
temporarily up from Sydney, house-
keeping for her brother Leo. Boyd
senses that there has been a break
between Barbara and her husband.
He visits Barbara several times, and
eventually decides to stay, though his
father does not like to give over the
reins altogether. Boyd dislikes and
distrusts Billy Mace, a rolling-stone
horsebreaker, who is paying some atten-
tion to Josie. Mrs. McGurdie (Ada),
who knows Barbara is in love with
Boyd, goes with McGurdie for a holi-
day. Barbara becomes moody towards
Boyd, and does not answer a note he
has written. Boyd finds that she has
gone to Sydney. Returning home after
the discovery, Boyd comes upon Mace,
spying on Josie bathing. He is furiousj
and a quarrel develops. This throws
Boyd and Josie together, with what
in the circumstances is the inevitable
result. On his father's return, Boyd
lightly goes off with cattle to Sydney.
McGurdie learns about Josie's condi-
tion, and assumes that Mace is respon-
sible, Josie's brother, young Jim., is
killed, under circumstances for which
McGurdie might blame himself ;
CHAPTER XXII.
In the Shadow.
LATE that afternoon McCurdie sat in
his office with a ledger in front of
him, looking at an account that had
been neatly ruled off and completed. He
had drawn the book towards him for want
of something to occupy his attention, and
mechanically had totted up the figures and
brought doWn the balance as though he
were performing a rite. There was a silence
about the place that was only broken by
the dripping of the kitchen tap, and a
faint hammering that came from the saddle-
room w’here Jeff Thorp was fitting some
boards together. The men had all been
brought back and, the day’s work aban-
doned, in tribute to the small figure that
lay in one of the verandah bedrooms,
wrapped in a sheet. It was said that a
priest was staying over at Mooney’s, and
Larry Byrne had gone to fetch him and
to give notice of the fatality at the nearest
police station.
“Eight pounds!” muttered MeCurdie,
staring at the figures. “Well, it’ll be some-
thing for the old man, anyhow. Not that
he’ll have any particular use for it.”
He was haunted by the figure of Duncan,
who seemed to hover like a shadow between
the woodheap and his tin hut, catching
the corner of his eye whenever he looked
out of the window. Since the accident the
old man had hardly spoken, except for a
half-articulate protest when there had been
talk of shooting the black colt. In the
first flush of remorse McCurdie had been
firm in his intention of shooting it, but
when he went back to the yards he found
that Duncan had quietly turned it out with
the other horses. It was the only act in
which he had shown his feeling, and now’
that there was no work awaiting him he
moved about as though in a dream, not
knowing what to do with his hands.
McCurdie could not forget that lean,
stiff-jointed figure with the wrinkled eyes.
It seemed to have taken on a strange
significance, looming darkly against the
horizon of his mind. Duncan was dressed
as though for Sunday, with a clean Crimean
shirt and a new’ hat that sat on his head at
an unusual angle, its broad brim tilted low
over his eyes. Apparently any occupation,
even the changing of his clothes, was a
relief to him.
“He’s taking it badly,” thought McCurdie.
“All his feelings tied up in a hard knot
inside! Well, I’d be the same. If the old
woman were alive she’d be sitting keening
outside the door of her hut with her apron
over her head. Women can let themselves
go.”
He felt he would be easier in his own
mind if Duncan let himself go—burst out
into a torrent of grief and anger. As it
was he was left to face the accusations that
were implicit in the old man’s silence. Not
fhat he blamed himself for the boy’s death!
It was just bad luck. Who could have
foreseen that the youngster w’quld have
attempted to ride a snake-headed brute
like that! Or that it would have fallen
with him when he had nearly mastered it!
It. was part of their life to take risks—
of his own as well—and Jim might have
been killed as easily on the cattle camp
or in the mulga as there in the yard. If
the same thing had happened to Boyd as
a youngster he would not have attempted
to place the blame on any human being.
Yet as he sat there, with his ledger open
at the dead boy’s account, his mind went
further back than the accident of the
morning. Little incidents of his relation-
ship with Duncan floated before him, pre-
senting themselves to him in a new light.
In those early days, when there had been
a shortage of reliable labor, hoW like a
godsend had Duncan’s arrival been to him!
He had watched him at his first job of
yard-building, noted his deftness with the
axe, his care that all the rails were the
right, thickness, the way he worked on into
the night to get some particular panel
finished. A man who plugged away like
a working bullock when any task was set
him, and yet had craft and quickness in his
hands! He had decided that the fellow
was necessary to Abernethy, and had done
everything he could to tie him to the place.
Built him a hut that at first he Would not
use, promised him schooling for his young-
sters, encouraged him to buy things at the
store and get behind on the books! The
tangled, diplomatic process unrolled before
him. How long since it had begun?
Fifteen years, or was it twenty?
The affair of the old draught-mare came
back to him, vivid as if it had all happened
yesterday. Duncan had brought the mare
to the place in his battered spring-cart—an
ugly, hammer-headed brute whose presence
annoyed McCurdie as he watched it feed-
ing by the creek. While it was there the
chance always remained that the fellow
would harness it up and drive away. He
had offered to buy it but Duncan had
always refused w’ith a quiet obstinacy.
“It’s not worth a couple of quid to
anyone but me,” he had said. “Somehow
I like to have a horse of my own.”
Then one day an Afghan hawker had
threatened to take it off in discharge of
some small debt. A sudden anger had
impelled McCurdie to pay the debt and
hunt the hawker off the place, taking the
receipt for the mare as mortgage for his
money. A settlement that had satisfied
everyone! The mare still went on grazing
by the creek, but McCurdie had a guarantee
that Duncan would not slip away when'the
impulse to wander came over him.
“Well,” he asked himself, now, in justi-
fication, “what has he lost by it? Does
he believe he’s lost anything himself?”
It was a question that hardly admitted
an answer. In the quiet of his office, w T ith
his emotions loosened by the event of the
morning, other questions rose up, piercing
into the heart of life. What did men live
for? The pursuit of some dream of happi-
ness? But some men hadn’t the capacity
to follow any one object for long. No
fixed will; no strong passions! They were
really more content when their initiative
was taken from them, and they were set
limited tasks that let each day close at
sundown. He looked out to where Duncan
was mechanically using the axe at the wood-
heap.
“He’s cut enough wood for a month,”
McCurdie told himself. “Doesn’t know
how to fill in his time. That youngster was
never at a loss”
A vision of the boy’s face, dark, vital,
flashed before him; the quick, agate-like
eyes, the nervous, likeable grin. Somehow
that eight pounds, the balance of the
account, lay heavily on his mind. Jim
had been saving up for a saddle with high,
curved kneepads, like the one Larry Byrne
had had made for him by a man in the
township. What an interest the boy took
in his work, and how keen he was to
notice a strange brand or an unfamiliar
earmark! In a few years he Would have
been a tower of strength to Abernethy!
McCurdie pushed back his chair and rose,
disturbing the brindle cattle-slut that lay
at the door. She looked up at him with
moist, sentimental eyes, as if to claim
sympathy with her condition, of imminent
motherhood. In the garden the sunlight
lay white and dazzling, the angles of the
roof throwing sharp, geometrical shadows
on the gravel. There was no sound in the
house except the buzzing of flies on the
wire screens of the windows. In her room
Mrs. Cleary lay on the bed with a hand-
kerchief over her face, and the new* girl
was searching the fig-tree at the bottom
of the garden for ripe fruit.
In McCurdie’s mind there was a strong
desire to talk to Duncan, to make the
old chap open out and show what he was
feeling. No good for a man to bottle
his thoughts up inside himself! Fragments
of sentences, shaped by the emotion that
was working in him, formed on his tongue,
but he could not give them coherence. He
stood quite still while Duncan, his back
turned, swung the axe with dead precision.
“About time to knock off,” he said at
last. “You’re the only man about the
place that’s working.”
Duncan stopped for a moment, awakened
and ill at ease.
“It’s more better than sitting still,” he
said.
The lapse into pidgin betrayed the state
of his mind. He corrected himself under
his breath, his lips giving out no sound.
McCurdie affected not to notice.
“Why not ride over and see Josie, then?”
he suggested. “Better that you should
tell her than anyone else.”
“She’ll have heard,” said Duncan. “They
are on the ’phone there, and Larry Byrne
Was going to let her know.”
“That’s so,” admitted McCurdie.
There seemed nothing for him to say or
suggest. He had no means of knowing
what was going on in Duncan’s mind, and
no avenue of approach to him. As tongue-
tied, both of them, as a couple of old
horses standing head to tail in the yard!
Down in the creek-bed one of the younger
blackboys had taken on Jim’s job of bring-
ing in the milkers and was swinging his
bridle and shouting ribald words at the
night horse that was cunningly evading
him.
“You’ll need a spell after this,” persisted
McCurdie. “Nothing like a change to buck
a man up! Why not ride over to Ella’s
at the end of the week and stay there
a while?”
Duncan mumbled something in reply,
but not as if the advice had made any
impression on him. He was fingering his
axe uncertainly, and when McCurdie at
last turned aWay he took up his work
again with obvious relief. To McCurdie
that mechanical thud, thud of the blunt
axe was like the falling of clods on a
coffin.
CHAPTER XXIII.
The Mopoke.
Over the rolling plains to the south, that
shimmered with everlastings and the corn-
like swathes of dried winter grasses, Boyd
came riding home, doing his forty miles
a day at a steady amble and camping for
a spell in the heat of noon. His horses
were in good condition, for they had not
felt a girth round them since he left them
paddocked after his trip down with the
cattle. And it had been a good winter.
Heavy rains in the early months, with
herbage lush as lucerne on all the creek
flats, and not enough frost to nip the topis
of the tomatoes in the station gardens!
Spring was in the air now, a Warmth and
quickening, that made butterflies dance
out from their cover and scents issue from
the soaked ground.
The tide of life was high in Boyd Mc-
Curdie. The uneasiness of spirit, the sense
of being in the grip of forces stronger than
his own will, that had haunted him during
the last days at Abernethy, was quite
banished. Many times while he was wait-
ing in Sydney killing time in a desultory
way he had called himself a coward. He
did not want to go back. He Was tor-
mented by sporadic impulses to scrap his
responsibilities and go off to the Islands—
anywhere that would give him the illusion
of being free and unfettered, in full pos-
session of himself.
“You’ve failed back there,” a voice
urged. “Floated along with the current
till you’ve got sucked under. What are
you likely to make of your life there now?
Better strike out again in another place.”
The old man could pull along without
him, he assured himself. He had run the
place for years, and could go on doing it;
or if Ada objected to that he could put
in a manager. And Josie! That was one
of the complex tangles that was only to
be solved by cutting free. It meant no-
thing to him, never had meant anything
to him but a surrender to the passion of
the moment; and probably that was all
there was in it for her. She would fipd
it as easy to forget as he would, if they
were not brought into daily contact. Hadn’t
he even noticed before he left a sort of
disillusionment in her eyes, a hint of
regret? As if she had a sense of something
dimmed and spoilt, and would rather have
been back on the old footing with him!
But he never had any real intention of
disappearing. In spite of the uneasy flicker-
ing of his will and desires, he knew he
was bound to the track he had chosen.
It was his meeting with Barbara that had
made him realise how fixed and continu-
ous his life was, though they had come
across one another by accident on a ferry
crossing to Watson’s Bay. He recalled that
meeting. He had been sitting at the ba.qk
of the boat with his cold pipe between his
teeth and his hat pulled over his eyes,
staring unseeingly at the shipping in the

The Orontes was decked in electric lights
from stem to stern on the evening of her
arrival, for there was a dance aboard. There
was an enthusiastic response to invitations.
Prince’s Pier was glutted with limousines
and sedans for several hours, and Customs
officers prowled round to see that these
didn’t contain contraband when they drove
away. The weather was ideal, Port Mel-
bourne’s frequent cold wind having sunk
to rest for the occasion. Chinese lanterns
cast soft radiance over the immense deck
and the music of the ship’s band was dis-
tributed by amplifiers. There were cactus
dahlias all over the ship, with gorgeous
masses on the, tables in the dining-saloon,
where supper was spread.
The Orient Co.’s Melbourne manager,
Arnold W. Johnson, and his wife, with
Commander F. R. O'Sullivan, received the
guests at the top of the gangway. Mrs.
Johnson’s ruby-red lace gown had a skirt
of uneven hemline and a cape, and Mrs.
O’Sullivan, who came from Ballarat to
attend the party on her husband’s ship,
wore black lace. Rear-Admiral and Mrs.
Munro Kerr were there, she with a bro-
caded coat of blurred pink rose design over
biscuit-tone .georgette and lace. Captain G.
D. AVilliams, Acting-Director of Navigation,
brought Mrs. Williams, whose pink gown
sparkled with crystal. Canadian Trade
Commissioner Ross accompanied Mrs. Ross,
just returned from an overseas trip. The
very latest fashions in gowns were sported,
the younger set making a specially smart
display. Among those who,danced or played
bridge were the P. Aldertons, the Robert
Knoxes, she in chiffon that dipped its royal
purple to the deek; the Russell Clarkes,
Robert Best and his lady, and Mr. and
Mrs. H. Schwieger. Mrs. Harry Creswick
displayed the charm of black velvet. Mrs.
G. G. Henderson was accompanied by her
daughter Lynette, whose frock was of sky-
blue taffeta. Kath Rogers Thomson danced
in a lengthy gown of faint green, and Pixie
Tabart’s filmy frock had a cape of a deeper
tone.
The luck of the Moonee. Valley R.C. didn’t
desert it on Labor Day. The weather was
perfect for the holiday meeting, and there
was a rattling good attendance. It was
a day for tweeds, and some smart and
charming outfits were sported.
The needs of the Ladies’ Benevolent
Societies of the State provided the reason
for the racing at Moonee Valley on Thurs-
day aftenioon. The members’ stand was, as
usual on such occasions, made conspicuous by
its small population. Mrs. G. G. Henderson,
president of the central council, and Mrs.
C. Z. Woinarski, hon. sec., with other mem-
bers were present to demonstrate their
appreciation of the club’s generosity. The
public rolled up in fair numbers, and vice-
chairman of the M.V.R.C., J. B. McArthur,
and Mrs. McArthur, Mrs. Ben Chaffey, the
Rogers Thomsons and Kathleen, Dr. Hilda
Rennie, Mrs. Barry Thomson and Mrs. A.
V. Kewney helped to redeem the members’
enclosure from emptiness.
Members of the Athenaeum Club, just
settled in their new and very comfy quarters
at the Treasury end of Collins-street, per-
mitted their wives and lady friends to see
how they live in this home away from home.
President George Allan, with Edward
Shackell and A. E. Johns at his back, gave
the greeting to the guests. The feminine
deputation explored the place from cellar
to roof, and had to admit that the men-folk
had made a good job of their retreat. There
were gurgles of delight over the swimming-
pool, a Romanesque affair entirely sur-
rounded by colored tiles and tesselated floor-
ing, and the squash-racket court —;the
Empire’s leading bachelor, Edward P., just
dotes on squash rackets —and the gymnasium
also earned approval, having about them a
fine manly flavor. The lounges, smoking-
rooms and dining-rooms and 20 or more
bedrooms tastefully furnished set the women
to estimating costs; and the kitchen —well,
the kitchen was a dream. There was after-
noon tea and a string band. . Mayoress Lux-
ton was among the invaders, who included
Miss Allan and Adelaide Allan, Mrs. Leslie
Stuart, Mrs. George Russell and Mrs. Hew-
lett.
The annual meeting of the Housewives’
Association on Friday didn’t advance the
affairs of the organisation to any great
extent. Like a modern Portia, all in black,
Mrs. Percy Russell, who said she had ascer-
tained the law as to her position, announced
that she was still the president, and as
there were no nominations for the office she
could declare herself elected for another
year if she wanted to. She added that when
she became president, 12 months ago, the
association was in debt to the tune of £O6,
now reduced to £B. A unanimous vote of
confidence in Mrs. Russell was passed, and
baskets of flowers were passed up to her.
Three policemen were in attendance, but
they had an easy afternoon. Dr. Maloney.
M.H.R., created a little diversion by claiming
to be a housewife, on the score that he had
paid his sub. and had been accepted as a
member. So everything passed off very
happily, but the association is hamstrung
for the time being. No cheques can be
signed nor payments made, since the only
officer the organisation now possesses, accord-
ing to the view of the Russellites, is a
president.
Guests invited to a dance at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Mortill, on the Hawthorn bank
of the Yarra on Saturday night, were shown
the pictures by French, German and Rus-
sian artists which the couple purchased dur-
ing their recent travels. The hostess wore
a peacli-pink satin gown of princess robe
mode that melted into a silk net flounce
embellished with pastel tinted floral em-
broidery. Beautiful flowers decorated the
reception-rooms, and rose-red candles in
silver sticks shed a soft glow over the
supper-table. Among the guests were Prof.
Agar and his wife, Dr. Demarquette and
Madame Joy McArden, artist George Bell
and Mrs. Bell, Prof. Bernard Heinze, Harry
and Nan McClelland, Blamire Young, Mr.
and Mrs. Ludowyx, Signor Carosi, the G.
Gills and Betty Paterson.
Double dahlias the size of soup plates
and cactus dahlias like huge tarantulas,
with a magnificent array of gladioli, were
the chief items of the Royal Horticultural
Society’s show at the Town Hall. Dahlias
of every color and many combinations of
color had been culled from nurseries, private
gardens and the Burnley College, where
gardeners are made. The champion bloom
rejoiced in the name of John Cronin and
was grown by C. G. Brown, of Eistern-
wick. Phyllis Stocks, of Neerim, with a
gladiolus—salmon pink splashed with deep
wine tint —named Mrs. S. A. Errey, claimed
the blue ribbon. The carnations were
not remarkable. Some choice things were
shown in the cottage garden section,
including delphiniums of imposing height,
and ranging from deep purple to indigo.
Knight Frank Clarke exhibited a seedling
that bore a full three feet of blossoms.
Among the rose entries was a non-competi-
tive group from Alister Clark’s famous
garden. From A. M. Nicholas’s glasshouses
came many rare orchids, the most arresting
specimen being a deep yellow—it looked as
if an aspro might alleviate its bilious dis-
position. The trophy presented by Mr.
Nicholas for gladioli was carried off by
Geo. Swenson, of Ballarat.
This quizzical expression belongs to Mrs.
Murray Waller, general secretary of the
Country Women’s Association and organiser
of the Mallee holiday scheme. She is an
Englishwoman who, after 10 years on the
land in Kent, where she grew fruit, came
to Melbourne about six years ago, and be-
came associated with the New Settlers’
Ij eag u e. In
war time she
was secretary
to Edith Brad-
ley, principal
of Studley
A g r icultural
College, and
had charge of
the billeting
and welfare of
Land Army
girls in 44 vil-
-lag e s. The
Thrift iCam-
p aig n and
Women’s In-
stitute move-
ments in Eng-
land also had
the benefit of
her services.
Mrs. Wilier
made acquaint-
ance with the
folk of the Mallee while connected with the
migration work of the New Settlers’ League,
and spent some time camping in the dis-
trict when tents were the only habitations.
Vandyck made the picture.
Many women who passed into Scott’s
Hotel on an afternoon of last week added
parcels to a pyramid in the vestibule. The
occasion was the annual appeal for linen for
the Homoeopathic Hospital, and the response
was sufficiently generous to banish the
anxiety of the management concerning sup-
plies of sheets, towels and pillow-cases for
a while at least. Mrs. H. S. K. Ward, presi-
dent, and other members of the Ladies’ Aid
Association saw to it that the donors had a
cup of tea and musical entertainment, Mrs.
A. M. Kuring having gathered up some song-
birds, monologue artists and instrumentalists.
A bunch of nurses from the hospital took
charge of the goods, and Mrs. W. Mackay,
the lion, sec., and Mrs. E. A. Bennett, acting-
lion. *treas., were also on hand. Thanks to
the ladies were said by It. M. Cutlibertson
and A. A. Peverill, of the board of manage-
ment of the institution.

The committee of the Old Collegians’ Assn,
of the P.L.C. indulged in competitions, char-
ades and coffee at the clubrooms one evening-
last week. Among the bunch of 50 or so
nice flappers who have just qualified for
the title of Old Collegians were Dorothy
Anderson, who was dux of the college, and
Helen Lawson and Dulcie Sloan, winners
of the Jubilee Memorial Scholarships which
take them to the Uni. These scholarships
were founded with the left-over funds from
the Jubilee celebrations about four years ago.
Mrs. J. H. Mirams, president of the 0.C.A.,
wearing green velvet and holding a presenta-
tion posy of crimson roses, gave greeting to
the new members, backed up by Mrs. A. L.
Abbott, the secretary. Mrs. Colin Macdonald ;
Anne Fortune, hon. sec. of the P.L.C. club;
the club’s president, Essie Mollison ; its hon.
treas., Miss Thomas; Bertha Braithwaite,
and Mrs. T. J. W. Kenny were others who
figured in the jolly little party.
The Office Flapper’s impressions of a ride
to Daylesford on Eight Hours Day:—“Me
and my gentleman friend set out in his car,
which is a six and so powerful that nothing
can pass it on the road. There was one ill-
mannered hog that did get ahead of us, but,
as Cyril said, it only showed how, when their
fathers have too much money, young cubs
get uppish. He—the young cub, I mean—•
was driving a Rolls-Royce with seats for
only two, and the girl was a perfect fright.
But, my word, these great open spaces do
open your mind. Out there girls are girls
and men are men, but it takes a bit of look-
ing to tell which is which. The first young-
lady we overtook was ambling along in a
pair of grey sports trousers borrowed from
her brother. Her lunch was slung in a
knapsack over her shoulder, which showed
she meant to be out all day and wasn’t
dependent on a boy friend for tucker. The
next girl we saw had Light Horse riding-
breeches. She straddled the back of a
motor-bike while her young Lochinvar hit
out for the west. She was a nice-looking
kid, but I never did like pink hair. Then
we nearly frightened off her steed another
young thing who had a right to wear them,
since she was on horseback. She was in
khaki breeches and leggings, and her sweater
clung to her figure. She wore a beret and
a rifle hung across her back. But she did
not shoot while we were watching her.
“Daylesford is on the road from Melbourne
to Ballarat or Bendigo or one of those places
that start with a B. Cyril said we ought
to go through Bacchus Marsh, where the
condensed milk comes from, and we did.
I’m glad we did, because there we saw elm
trees that are thousands of years old, which
are things you seldom see in this young
country. When we got away from the elms,
which are really awe-inspiring, we began to
climb the Great Dividing Range, which is
a place that divides something from some-
thing else and could be enjoyed better if
the car didn’t make such a dreadful groan-
ing noise. At last we got to Victoria’s Spa,
where folks go to take the waters, which
Cyril says are good any way you take them,
within or without. H'epburn water is the
strongest, a fact that was discovered by an
inhabitant who stored some in a thermos
flask in mistake for beer, and it burst the
flask. Daylesford is a large town a long way
from sea-level and the streets are planted
with oaks and elms and cedars . thousands
of years old. There are big heaps called
dumps there which show that the district
was once a vast goldmine. We got out of
the dumps after consuming sandwiches and
lager and set back towards town, the advan-
tages of which a girl doesn t reaiise till ,sh
has lived for a while in the great Uutmma.
I noticed what Cyril said were maple-trees,
which in Canada are made a national baage,
and some white dots that might have
sheep. Cyril, who works for a woolbroher,
told me all about how the ruffians in Braa
ford have been oppressing the poor u™
things, but I really was so tired, m
all those great open spaces and tresii air,
that I just dozed, and the next thing i
knew we were home again. But, travelling
is very enlarging to the intellect.
Where fashion designers get their inspira-
tions from is obscure, but as good a guess
as any is that the notion of the new flared
skirt, with its uneven hemline, came from
the veiled-tail goldfish of Japan. Ihese
and other ornamental fishes were shown
recently at the Town Hall, at an exhibition
organised by Mayoress Luxton, in conjunc-
tion with the Bird and Fish Exhibiting
Society, to help the Berry-street Foundling
Home. Almost every known type of gold-
fish was represented, together with Dutch
eels and the South American axolotis, which
seems to be a hybrid of lizard, toad and hsh.
Harold Lloyd glasses might be traced to the
telescope goldfish of China, which have huge
black-ringed protruding eyes. Among the
exhibitors were Miss D. McNalty, of Cam-
berwell, and Norman McCance, who in
sterner moments tells listeners-in about the
prowess of gladiators at the Stadium and
gee-gees on the racecourses. About x±w
was netted by the show.
Major O. J. Lawson, of Brighton, escorted
his elder daughter, Betty Frances, up the aisle
of St. John’s, to meet Arthur William,
second son of Mr. and Mrs. John Gubbins, ot
Ripple Vale, Birregurra. Four ’maids in
frilled frocks of pale pink net and toques ot
the same tint of velvet, carrying sheaves ot
tiger-lilies attended the bride, whose ivory
satin robe with long, clinging bodice had a
deep-fluted flounce that ran in ups and downs
to a train. A Limerick veil floated over
flesli-colored tulle.
Premier Hogan went to the Alfred Hos-
pital on Friday and launched a fete, the
proceeds of which are to reduce the over-
draft on the maintenance account. The
auxiliaries of the hospital were in charge or
the many stalls, and the weather was favor-
able.
The Red Cross Council poured tea at the
Windsor on Friday afternoon as an accom-
paniment of farewell to general-secretary
Philadelphia Robertson, who is to be Aus-
tralian delegate at a London conference.
O. M. Williams held out the greeting hand,
and Chief Justice Irvine’s lady handed Miss
Robertson a posy. The chairman, the Lres-
well and Miller ladies and others paid tribute
to Miss Robertson’s efficiency.
When the Postal Institute’s am. dram, soc.,
put on “Ambrose Appleyard’s Adventure
at the King’s on Saturday night the usher-
ettes and programme-sellers were girls whose
handkerchief millinery bore the skull and
crossbones —the play has a hidden-treasure
and pirate-ship interlude. The object of the
four-night season was to help the Legacy
Club to provide a permanent holiday camp
at Balnarring for soldiers’, orphans. The
scenery and costumes used in the Grossmith
production of the comedy were loaned bj
the Firm, and the piece went very well.
Fannie Gargurevitch, as a bold, bad adven-
turess, wore dashing raiment of blacky satin
with a snlash of green; and Irene V onna-
cott, as Poppy Faire, sported green satin
slippers that peeped from beneath numerous
frills of lemon-colored georgette, Gifts ot
flowers at the final curtain were piled high on
the stage.
In oil and pastel Dora Wilson, at her
show at the Fine Arts Gallery, gave a sort
of pictorial potpourri gleaned from places
she had visited during her travels in the
Old World. Miss Wilson, who started out
as a portraitist, discovered after a while that
Melbourne streets abound in picturesque
patches, which she put on canvas. Ih a t
proved a very lucrative art avenue, and she
was encouraged to pursue the vein in Fans,
London, Vienna and other cities, but the
market for the exotic bits isn’t so good as
it was for the street scenes we all know.
Even so, about a third of the exhibits bear
red seals.
The Alliance Francaise at its first meeting
this year welcomed the recently appointed
French Consul, Paul Marcus. The president.
Rene Vanderkelen, gave greeting, and after-
wards read a couple of chapters of Victo:
Hugo’s “Les Miserables” as a contribution
to the evening’s entertainment.
Dawn Harding, in a gown featuring pale
green chiffon and gold lace, charmed a large
audience with her mezzo-soprano notes a
her recital last week. She sang French
cuansons, German lieder and English
ancient and modern, and she received a rich
reward of flowers.
Mrs. Geoffrey Palmer is again farewellin?
her old friends. She returns, to her English
home in the Cathay on April 22. For the
rest of her sojourn here, she is staying with
her sister, Mrs. Lethbridge.

Sir John and Lady Goodwin went to
Booroodabin baths for the Girl Guides’
annual swimming carnival. Dr. Porter, from
Scotland, was with the vice-regals. Mesdames
Duckett White, J. D. Bell and C. Dixon
received the party. Lady Goodwin, in navy
blue and rose beige, presented the trophies.
Charles Dearden is running Nicolai Nade-
jine’s concert. The massive, Russian, who
married Brisbane’s Nelle Tritton, sings in
half a dozen tongues.
The Nellie Bramley company has been
having a brief season at Townsville before
leaving for the Opera House, Sydney. “Ann
100 Per Cent.,” the play Nellie staged for
her initial performance here two years ago,
was the grand finale. The Empire is shortly
to house talkies, but Leon Gordon has
brought back the legit, to His Majesty’s.
George Sampson is' arranging the musical
programmes for the opening of the new
City Hall.
Parson Ball, whose out-back territory is
slightly bigger than the British Isles,
recently came on a small settlement over the
South Australian side of the border where
a couple were waiting a chance to get mar-
ried. His splicing license is only good in
Queensland, so the wedding party boarded a
car and crossed the border. The ceremony
took place under a coolabah which marked
the stores depot of Burke and Wills, and a
petrol-case served as a table for the signing
of the register. After that the cake was
cut on it.
There was a farewell party at the Women’s
Club for Helen Hill, shown alongside, who
goes to Vienna to represent her Queensland
sisters at the
Internatio n a 1
Council. The
club was
decked in
sacred bamboo
and African

hostesses were
Mrs. Longman,
Mrs. E. B.
Harris and
Mrs.* A. J.
Mallalieu. A
wallet of notes and a sheaf of pink roses
and zinnias were handed to Miss Hill, who
is one of 10 Australian delegates to the
conference.
Carl Hoemermann took Beryl Phyllis
Andrewartha to wife in St. Andrew’s kirk.
The Rev. Scott Macdonald tied the knot,
Dailey Scarlett was at the organ, and
Horace Andrewartha sang “Because.” The
bride, who was given away by her father,
was in white satin with a veil of cut tulle
and orange blossom, and carried a bouquet
of white roses, lilies and orchids. Her
’maids, Maisie Andrewartha and Barbara
Jessup, wore Nile green spot tulle and green
tulle head-dresses. Selwyn saw the feasting,
and the going-away frock was bottle green.
The southern division of the C.W.A. met
at Toowoomba to condemn the ownership
of airguns and pea-rifles by kiddies, to turn
thumbs down for beauty competitions and
to give their support to the “Wear More
Wool” crusade. Mayor Annand suggested
that concessions on railway tickets for
women travelling to the mountains ought
to be just as available as those on tickets to
the seaside, but the Commissioner thinks
otherwise. It was decided to ask the Govern-
ment to make ambulance arrangements for
maternity calls from either the Maternity
General Hospital or a clinic.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The O’Gradys and party rolled up at the
Art Society’s Ball at the Continental, where
the dancers overflowed into the exhibition
hall from the main ballroom. Vice-president
L. Dechaineux received the visitors.
The harbor was a picture on the day of
the at-home given by Rear-Admiral Evans
and the officers of the Australia on board the
flagship. Brilliant sunshine, blue water,
colored flags and frocks, and tlie overseas
vessels in port combined to make a setting
as vivid as a poster. A crowd of guests
danced, fed, chattered and examined the ship
all the afternoon. Mrs. Evans wore dahlia-
red with a fairly wide-brimmed hat. Mar-
garet O’Grady was in something the same
shade, with a hat of beige straw.
Child-welfare folk were gratified at the
roll-up for the annual “ungrown-ups’ ” ball
at the Continental. The C.J.’s lady is presi-
dent, and Mrs. Fred Brough secretary. The
home-made supper, always a feature of
these shows, was as delectable as ever. In
former years it hasn’t always been easy to
pick out the juveniles, with shingled heads
and knee-length frocks worn by all alike, but
the task becomes easier with the lengthening
draperies of the older dancers.
The Westminster Glee Singers, under the
familiar Branscombe leadership, have been
delighting music-lovers at the Theatre Royal.
Mayor Soundy gave the company a civic
reception on their arrival, and the concerts
have been well attended.
Misadventure has followed the naval squad-
ron during its short visit to our The
crashing of the amphibian Seagull A 7 has
added another to the list of deaths, and at
the time of writing the two poor fellows in
hospital are in a bad way. The accident
makes a tragic finish to what is usually
looked upon as the squadron’s holiday season.
Lido-blue velvet and a velour hat in the
same shade made the wedding turnout for
Faith Gordon Spotswood, 8.A., as she walked
down the aisle of St. Aidan’s, Launceston,
as Mrs. Denham Henty. The church was
decorated in all shades of blue delphiniums
and pink and blue hydrangeas. Sister
Dorothy was the only ’maid, frocked in a
tweed ensemble with liat to match.
Artist Mildred Lovett (Mrs. Stanley rater-
son) is back in the Speck from the other
side of the world. The little lady has been
studying modern art in several European
cities; while in Paris she worked at Andrd
Lhote’s studio.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
There was a counter attraction to polo on
Saturday in the flying contest at Parafield,
whither everything on wheels seemed to be
heading. Lady Somers was there for after-
noon tea with Mr. and Mrs. T. E. Barr-
Smith, her only public appearance during
the week, which she has spent in the vice-
regal stronghold at Marble Hill.
After years of wandering the Adelaide
Repertory Theatre has found a resting-place
in Australia Hall, Angas-street, where there
is a stage suitable for the club’s productions.
It opened its 1930 season with a lecture
evening; Misses M. Craigie and E. Robin
spoke upon the ups and downs of the drama,
and there were two one-act plays. Next
Saturday “The Truth About Blades” will
be unfolded in the new home.
That generous supporter of art Alec
Melrose has just presented three pictures
to the South Australian Art Gallery. There is
a painting of Major-General O’Shea, by Sir
Martin Archer Shee; one of Sir Edward Sey-
mour (Speaker of the House of Commons in
Stuart days), by Sir Peter Lely; and one
of Miss Elizabeth Gray, by Sir John Watson
Gordon.
Mrs. Barr Malcolm, of Fullerton, has
issued invitations for the wedding of her
pretty Primrose with Wallace Carruthers,
of Sydney, on April 23, at St. Michael’s
Church, Mitcham.
The Sisters of Mercy have been celebrat-
ing their golden jubilee. In May, 1880, 2-1
nuns, mostly Spanish, came from the Argen-
tine to establish a Convent of Mercy in
Adelaide; five of them are still alive, four
in the city and one at Mount Gambier. The
jubilee was ante-dated a few weeks, as
Archbishop Spence leaves for Rome imme-
diately after Easter.
The South Australian Lawn Tennis
Association gave a little dance in the Mount
Lofty kiosk on Saturday night as a wind-up
to the tournament. Inter-State players rolled
up in force.
An unusual feature about the Turf career
of the late R. M. Hawker was that his wife
was as keen as he was. A daughter of
Andrew Tennant, a great sportsman of last
century, she always had a horse or two
running in her name, and between them they
won at some time practically every important
event in S.A., as well as a few in Melbourne.
Oyklon, the best thing they ever owned, was
hers.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
What with thick walls, dark window-
shades and electric fans, the lounge in the
King Edward was a refrigerator compared
with the hot streets outside on the afternoon
of Mrs. Dave Walsh’s bridge party. The
hostess wore geranium crepe de Chine, her
mother was in black pussy-willow and her
sister in a gumleaf-green jumper suit. Among
other shades to take the eye were the apricot
voile of Mrs. Lewington, the saxe-blue of
Mrs. Mulcahy and the moorlands-purple of
Mrs. Krauth. Mrs. Fred Curran had a dash
of white on her china-blue silk; Kathleen
Walsh wore white linen and sister Alice two
shades of rose; Faith Flintoff sported a little
coatee with her lemon georgettes; and Violet
Holmes looked cool in pink.
There were rejoicings at the birth of 6ML
in Musgrove’s old music-room transformed.
Green palms in terra-cotta pots are the only
dash of color against the black curtains, white
walls and black grand piano. Dr. Battye
made an opening speech through the micro-
phone, reminding listeners that broadcast-
ing is a step in the progress of the twen-
tieth century comparable with the invention
of printing in the fifteenth.
Ex-Premier Henry Lefroy was within five
days of the 76th milestone when the journey
ended. A warm friend and a fine citizen, he
was able to gratify the two things nearest
his heart, love of the soil and service to his
country. Flags were flown at halfmast
through the midlands, Moora put up
the shutters during the funeral service in St.
James’s, and school children formed a guard
of honor for the cortege on the first stage
of its journey to Perth. There was a
second service the next day in St. George’s
Cathedral.
The match between Woodfull’s campaigners
and Westralia was played in the most ener-
vating heat this summer has inflicted upon
us, which is saying much. It made no differ-
ence to the enthusiasm of cricket devotees,
and the exuberance of youth—small boys,
bats and pencils scuttled incessantly be-
tween the grandstand and the gates to beg
heroes’ autographs—but only about a tenth
of the spectators were women, and th 6 frock-
ing was not startling.
One of the last farewell parties for a
departing bride-elect was arranged by Elsie
Saw for Kaye Smith. The guest of honor
wore flowing black lace. Among the fare-
wellers were Peggy Coll, Dollie House, Mrs.
Frank Manford, Margaret Officer, Joan Good
and Stella Meagher. Miss Smith and her
mother boarded the Minderoo a few days
later for Singapore and wedding-bells. A
trip to the Cold Land is billed for the ’moon.
The late Judge Buchanan, who was an
auctioneer in S.A. before he became first
Master and then Judge of the State’s
Supreme Court, and who lived in Sydney
after his retirement, left an estate valued at
£6OOO.

Men Are Human (Continued jrom p. J+7).
harbor, when she had come upon him with
a little breathless rush, almost sliding into
his arms as the people moving for the
gangway bumped her:
“Boyd! You down here?”
That flutter of wonder and excitement
betrayed her to him. He felt in his blood
the impulsive pressure of her hand on his
wrist, the catch in her breath when she
laughed, the swift flow of her life toward
him. She was not restrained as she had
been at Niva Downs. There was an
abandon about her, a sense of being
released. In the little flat at Rushcutter’s
Bay where she had been living alone she
let him see what her life had been, curling
up in a leather chair with her feet under
her and watching him through her cigarette
smoke as he leaned against the mantel-
piece. Perhaps it was the long repression
she had been laboring under that made her
so ready to give herself away, to tell him
of all the humiliations she had suffered
since she had married Day. Perhaps it
was because of something that had leapt
from cover as soon as they met. At the
back of his mind he remembered Josie and
the spell she had laid on his senses for
a while; but that already seemed like
something that had happened a long time
ago. He had a feeling that Barbara was
his woman, and that he could be open
and frank with her as he had never been
with anyone before. No need to hide
anything from her! No need to pretend
he was made all in one piece, like a figure
of marble! Those brown, understanding
eyes knew what life was.
He rode along, following the flight of
turkeys that rose from the long grass,
noting the places where he had camped
with the cattle coming down, contrasting
the emptiness he had been conscious of
then with the richness that filled him now.
Life was wonderful! It renewed itself
continually like the bed of a dry creek
gathering up the rains. There was no need
to regret the false steps he had taken,
and the way he had let his energies be-
come scattered, thrusting now in this direc-
tion and now in that. He was satisfied he
had found himself now, and would not be
tormented by a divided will in the future.
At the little pub a day’s journey from
home he sniffed the first scent of familiar
places when he saw a brown, flat-sided
mare feeding with a bunch of others in
the tussocky, four-acre paddock.
“Mace’s!” he muttered to himself. “I
w’onder has he sold it to some drover or
other.”
But the lean figure of the horsebreaker
met his eyes as soon as he entered the bar.
Mace was very drunk. He stood arguing
with an old tanksinker in a corner, catch-
ing him by the front of the shirt for sup-
port as he swayed backwards and forwards
on his heels, and repeating something over
and over in a thick, guttural voice. There
was a smear of dry blood on the side of
his face and his clothes looked as if he
had been wallowing in the mud by the
tank. When the brisk, alert little publican
greeted Boyd by name he turned round
and stared at him, a morose expression on
his face'and the whites of his eyes showing.
“Cap’n McCurdie!” he repeated, waving
a flimsy arm. “Stan’ up, Mace, you loafing
hound, and present arms! Here’s the big
joss coming—the man who’ll teach every-
one carry out an order.... Came back
from the w’ar with not a scratch on him
an’ a big bunch of medals on his chest!
Foun’ them all in the one bully-beef tin.
No, I’m talking. No use kicking when
the ropes are on you!”
His fingers were fumbling with a greasy
note.
“Drinks all roun’,” he said, tossing it on
the counter. “We’re going to have one
together and be friends. The on’y man
who ever got the better of Billy Mace
Came in behind him and sunk in the
boot!”
He tried to pick up a glass and knocked
it to the floor, shivering it in fragments.
“Now then, Billy; out you go!” snapped
the publican. “You’ve had enough already.
Get outside into the fresh air.”
He came round the counter and edged
the horsebreaker firmly towards the door.
There was a scuffle, but Mace was in no
condition to offer resistance. He looked
over his shoulder at Boyd’s turned back,
and spat on the floor.
“Rubbin’ in the dirt, eh?” he muttered.
“Don’t take any more notice of me than
if I was a blowfly! Well, I’m not down
and out yet. Ask him”
His voice was drow'ned by the clatter of
a form knocked over on the verandah as
he was bustled through the door.
“A cow of a fellow, that!” said the
publican, coming back. “Full as' a tick
one minute, and sober and cantankerous
the next! I’ve cleared him out two or
three times, but he camps for a couple
of days at the edge of the scrub and then
drifts back. Been fired from Abernethy,
hasn’t he?”
“I don’t know,” said Boyd. “If he was,
it wasn’t any too soon.”
“Something stung him there,” volunteered
the publican. “When he first came down
he was talking wild and had an ugly look
about him. Mad about a woman he’d
been done out of! The second day he
was here, though, he came a cropper jump-
ing his mare over the barbed wire, and
that’s let some of the poison out of him.”
There was merely an amiable garrulity
in his voice, but the very presence of
Mace made Boyd disinclined to put in a
night at the place. Making a lame excuse
to the publican he rode off, camping a
few miles further on at a dam. The sham-
bling figure of the horsebreaker came again
before his mind as he lay wrapped in his
blanket, his pipe in his mouth and his
inverted saddle propping up his head. It
was not an ordinary spree Mace was on;
the fellow was gradually going to pieces,
losing his pride in his appearance and the
air of dash and alertness that had once
made him look like a poised hawk. What
had been responsible for the decay in him?
Had that hammering by the creek humili-
ated 1 him in his own eyes, filling him
with a secret' self-contempt? Or had his
feeling for Josie been something more than
a passing disturbance of the senses?
“What does it matter?” thought Boyd,
brushing a slight shadow from his mind.
“If he hadn’t gone to the Devil one
w’ay, he would another. Something of the
snake about him, as Josie always said!
Born to use his fangs, or have his head
bruised by someone’s heel!”
By the next afternoon Boyd was at Aber-
nethy, jogging along under the squat gums
of the creek bed towards the horse-paddock
gate. It seemed as if he had bden away
for a long while, and he was struck anew
by the beauty of the place. The white
pise walls of the homestead showed vividly
against the background of new spring green,
and here and there drooping peppermas
broke the ragged lines of the outbuildings,
while the w'ild tangle of garden in front
was gouted with flaring oleanders. Not a
breath of air stirred the big round fan of
the windmill or flecked the surface of the
still lagoon, where the pelicans floated,
gazing down complacently at their own
shadows. The silver-bright masses of mulga
on the further bank looked like another
lagoon, infinite, giving back the light.
They had killed a bullock at the yards.
McCurdie, his coat off, was pulling the
carcase up on the gallows, while Duncan
and the overseer with quick slashes peeled
off the hide. A smell of blood and offal
came from the ground, and the half-dozen
bullocks penned in the receiving yard pawed
the dust in fear and sensual excitement,
lowering from the pits of their stomachs.
Lean dogs from the camp nosed round for
scraps, and on the rails sat half a dozen
spindle-shanked youngsters, avid as crows.
McCurdie did not see Boyd until he was
a few yards away, and then he sprang up
with an eager grunt:
“Good Lord, it’s you, Boyd! Didn’t
expect you till to-morrow at the earliest.
Leave your horses here and come down
for a drink No, I can’t shake hands.
Blood to the elbows!”
He was exuberant but fumbling, talking
with a quick rush of words, and rattling
at the kitchen gate Without being able to
find the latch. There was a warmth in the
greeting that touched Boyd. It was not in
what his father said, but in the quick flash
of his eyes, the tone of his voice, the way
the decanter tinkled against the glass when
he poured out the whisky. He seemed to
have accumulated wrinkles round the eyes
during the last few months, and his mous-
tache was whiter, while something about
the back of his head made him look an
old man. That tortoise-like slope from the
crow’n to the top of the spine! It made
his body seem heavier, as if the explosive
quality in it had been damped down and its
power reduced.
“Been down with rheumatism lately,”
McCurdie explained. “A hell of a com-
plaint for a man like me! Longest time
I’ve spent on my back for forty years!
See Barbara down there?”
He shot the question out suddenly, his
keen grey eyes searching his son’s face.
“Yes,” said Boyd casually. “I met her.
By accident, as it happened.”
“Then you know she’s cut free?....
When’s she coming back to Niva Downs?”
“In about a month’s time, she says.
Sooner, perhaps. She wants to fix the
place up for Leo before he gets married.”
There was an air of unconcern in his
manner, though he knew the meaning of
that probing look in the old man’s eyes,
It ought to have been easy enough to tell
him about Barbara, but he couldn’t do it.
That old disinclination to give himself
away l
“God alone knows Why she hung on so
long,” said McCurdie. “If she’d asked my
advice She’s a straight run ahead of
her now, though.”
He went on to talk of Ada’s sudden
departure for town, of the death of young
Jim, of the mob of store cattle he had
bought from a place on the Dawson River.
There was a queer diffidence in his tone
when he mentioned the last transaction,
as if he were uncertain whether he had not
taken too much on himself, but the run was
understocked and grass going to waste. He
had arranged with Larry to set off in a
day or tw*o to bring the cattle down, pick-
ing up what men he wanted on the way.
Although Boyd had heard of the boy’s
death before he only realised its full mean-
ing when he saw Duncan sitting down to
his evening meal in the kitchen. Through
the window of the bathroom, where he was
towelling himself, he caught sight of the old
man bending over his plate, and a sudden
sense of isolation rushed over his heart.
It was not that Duncan was alone; Mrs.
Cleary was bustling about filling the big
lamp, and Larry was leaning against the
dresser cleaning his nails, the two of them
keeping up a lively flow of banter. But
Duncan paid as little attention to them as
if he was deaf and blind. He sat against
the wall, his shadow large and grotesque
against the white kalsomine, and his jaws
moving as mechanically as those of a horse
munching oats. All the time he hardly
shifted his eyes, which were fixed abstract-
edly on the label of the sauce-bottle in
front of him.
When had Josie left, and why? In the
relief of hearing that she had gone he had
not speculated very much about the reason.
Down there she had become curiously insub-
stantial to him; even her features were not
clear to his mind and merged into those
of the last woman he had seen in a ferry or
tram. But here, in the places he had always
seen her, she became real again, almost too
painfully real. As he sat at the table he half
expected to catch a glimpse of her coming
across the landing with a tray, the breeze
from the garden ruffling back her hair, and
her eyes sparkling with the memory of some
joke she had just heard in the kitchen.
It would have been awkward for him if she
had remained on at Abernethy; he would
never have been free from a feeling of com-
punction when he watched her carrying
wood in from the heap or bending over the
washtub. Did she realise herself why he
had stayed away, and was that why she
had gone off to Ella’s?
“I met Mace down at Cafferty’s,” he
told his father when they were smoking
together that evening. “Full as an egg,
and inclined to be nasty! You screwed
yourself up to getting rid of him at last?”
“Yes!” said McCurdie absently. “Fired
him six weeks ago.”
He was thinking that it would be a month
till Barbara came back. Would he be able
to find an excuse to stay on as long as that?
He did not want to leave till he had seen
her; seen her and satisfied his mind about
the way things were going.
“Mace?” McCurdie repeated. “Yes. I had
to get rid of him. Bit of unpleasantness
about Josie. Looks as if our flash friend
was responsible for that.”
“Unpleasantness? In what way?”
“Well, the girl’s in trouble,” said Mc-
Curdie. “You knew she’d gone off to Ella’s.
I suppose there’s nothing to worry about;
she’s not the sort to go under because of a
little slip like that. But I had to get rid
of Mace for the look of things. Couldn’t
have him swaggering around the place, and
perhaps ruffling his plumes more than ever.”
Boyd had risen from his chair and was
standing on the edge of the verandah, his
face hidden. For awhile he was silent, his
body still as a post, and his eyes fixed on
the gravel-path below him.
“Did she lead you to believe it was
Mace?” he asked at last, without turning
his head.
There was a flatness about his voice that
made the old man raise his eyebrows.
“Oh, well,” he replied with a shrug, “you
wouldn’t expect me to put her through the
third degree. It wasn’t my affair—not
primarily my affair, anyway. Ada did try
to pump her once or twice, but she was
slippery as a melon-seed. No whimpering
about her, or dropping her bundle, though!
Drove off in the Maroubra buggy as if she
was setting out on a holiday she’d been
looking forward to for years.”

The Tracks of Youth.
We followed our star in the days gone
by on the tracks that the drifters
tread
Who have turned to roam from the walls
of home to the wider ways ahead.
The outward road was gay with the
flowers of youth as we sought
romance,
And the warning word but carelessly
heard in the glamor of change arid
chance.
We played the game that the rovers
play; we fared with them, worst
and best;
We took our place in a careless race and
battled it with the rest.
We learned to grin at the blows of life
as ice toughened our hearts and
hands
In the outside school where a credulous
fool is trimmed to the world’s
demands.
But the years were rich with mateships
true, born in moments of need and
doubt,
When the treasured schemes of our
youthful dreams in bitterness faded
out,
And the kindly years have hidden the pain
in the book of the past since then,
Till we feel the fire of an old desire as
the longing comes again
MAORILAND.
To camp far out where the stars hang
near and the air is like rich old
wine;
Where the trees are friends, and all
bitterness ends that was born in
the auld lang syne;
Where the secrets stored in the soul of
a man steal forth as the hour grows
late,
Till he gives them there to the sacred
care of an understanding mate ;
To wake again to a vagabond morn
where the luring distance calls
To the road ahead and the plains wide-
spread with the cloudless sky for
walls;
To the easy jest of a trusted mate and
the tales that the nomads find,
Tales grim or gay that lighten the way
in the land of Never Mind. ...
Vain longings these for the life that
seemed so fair to our youthful
eyes!
In the ordered ways of the present days
our path to the future lies.
’Twas youth that colored our vision then
—ice should seek for the spell in-
vain ;
And the mates of yore we would find
no more... . Thank God that the
dreams remain!

He went on to explain that he was satis-
fied neither Jeff nor Larry had had any-
thing to do with the girl, and that he had
not even exchanged two words about the
matter with her father. Men were human,
and there was a queer, defensive pride
about the old fellow that would make him
resent the affair being broached! No way
of getting down to bedrock with him, really,
except so far as the practical working of
the place was concerned! And then the
death of young Jim had driven it all out of
his mind. He had been as fond of the
youngster as if he were one of the family.
A boy in a thousand!
But Boyd was not listening. The news
about Josie made him feel as if a door had
been suddenly opened within him, letting
a bleak wind blow upon his spirit. The
sense of harmony and self-satisfaction that
had filled him for weeks, even during the
long ride home, was dissipated and de-
stroyed. It was extraordinary how little
he had been prepared for this. Was that
because something in his mind had instinc-
tively shirked facing it as a possibility, and
had side-tracked his thoughts in other direc-
tions?
he could not admit the truth to
his father just then; had neither the will
nor the words. No need to meet trouble
half-way! He sauntered down the track to
the lagoon, his mind a blur, his feelings
curiously torpid, as if the very air around
him had become dead. Through the open
window of the men’s quarters he could see
Jeff sitting at the table writing a letter, and
Larry sprawling on his bunk, his pipe in his
mouth and his knees drawn up. Down at
the tin hut Duncan’s candle was still burn-
ing, and there were a few flickering fires
across the creek. .
A vision of Josie driving off in the
Maroubra buggy flashed before him—the
white starched frock, the hat tied with a
blue gossamer, the battered suitcases
stacked in the tray behind. He could see
her as plainly as if a flood of sunlight
had suddenly poured over the paddock
and revealed her climbing to her seat. And
even Ada’s cross-questioning had been
ineffectual in wringing her secret from her!
“Straight as a gun-barrel!” he thought.
“Kept her mouth shut for fear of injuring
me! It couldn’t have been with any
thought of herself.”
He was touched to the quick by this
evidence of her loyalty. It brought her
nearer to him than any surrender to his
passion had ever done, endowing her with
a new dignity, and making her live with a
more vivid reality in his mind. Her eyes
had not merely that dancing lure in them:
they held the fixed steadfastness he had
sometimes noticed in them when she looked
at Jim. Yet how could he respond to this
fineness in her with a like fineness?
From the shadowy mulga across the
lagoon came the voice of a mopoke, the two
notes sounding ghostly and dismal, as if
they issued from the very heart of darkness.
Boyd, standing by the lagoon looking down
at the dim water, felt a shiver go through
him. Damn the bird! There was some-
thing peculiarly disturbing in those sombre
notes. As a boy, lying awake in the room
on the verandah, they had always con-
jured up premonitions of evil in his mind,
and they did so still.

Durell
C. B. DE BOEHME’S
FINE STUDY OF A HUMAN FAILURE.
“ r T" , IIE less some people have to say the
I more they tell you about it,” said
Barron, as Durell finally tailed off
monotonously. Durell did not seem hurt,
however ; he was used to such remarks. He
blinked at his audience through strong glasses
that seemed to make his watery eyes more
protuberant than ever.
Slowly sipping a whisky and soda he lis-
tened to the talk which surged around him.
God! these men with their booming laughter
and their feeble jokes! Did the level of
their talk ever rise above sport, politics and
business? They sickened him. There was
Barron, thin-lipped, ascetic, looking rather
like a mediaeval saint. In fact he was a
successful stockbroker whose existence was
confined to shares and the inevitable woman.
Durell pitied the woman.
Over there, sprawled out in an armchair,
was Rackshaw; still young, but his tailor
was finding it increasingly difficult to dis-
guise the fact that his customer was no
longer anything but portly. The man talked
of wines and food till one wondered why the
deuce he ever bothered about being anything
but a chef. Yet the world counted him an
eminent citizen. Another instance of human
stupidity that couldn’t or wouldn’t see behind
the veil of money and prosperous appear-
ances!
The world had the same view about Torlot
—Torlot with his walrus moustache and
heavy, drooping eyelids. The fellow looked
like an old vulture ready to hop on to the
body before it was cold.
Durell tittered at the thought, and the
sound broke through the talk.
“More witticisms for our benefit, I sup-
pose?” said Barron, turning on him. “I
thought your session for the evening was
over.”
“Oh no —it’s nothing. We 11... .that is ....
And Durell sank back into silence again.
Damn it, why did he feel such a fool when
that man with his acrimonious tongue spoke
to him? Anyhow, old Torlot was a vulture,
in spite of his save-the-world attitude that
he was so careful to keep before the public.
To hear that man on a platform braying like
a blatant ass! “Mr. Henry Torlot, the well-
known M.P., will give an address ... . The
place would be crowded, a lot of fools drink-
ing it all in! What did the old hypocrite care
about the world? Nothing! He was lining
his own nest. But he’d crash one of these
days! Some of his little tricks would come
° U Durell started on his second whisky and
soda.
They were arguing now about some sport-
ing question—you’d have thought their very
souls depended on it. Of course sport was
important —he wished he’d been able to do
something in that line when he was a boy.
Yet if he broke into such an argument, tbfi
best he’d get would be a resigned silence.
Damn the lot of them! What did they c re
about the things that mattered? What did
.the beauty of life, of art, of God mear. to
them? Something to be jeered at, to make
coarse jokes about! On the other hand,
what did the poverty and misery, the injus-
tice and the general beastliness o*. life
matter? To them it was something to be
avoided, like a loathsome disease. They
were above that sort of thing; it didn t
affect them; it mustn’t be brought before
them “Poor feller, I gave him a shilling.
Yes that was it. Salve their consciences,
if they possessed such things. Oh very con-
venient ! - , T",
In their eyes he was a fool, of course. Be-
cause as a boy he’d been a weakling, brought
un in a country rectory by a devoted mother,
he’d never had to fight the world. He sup-
posed it ”<vas a pity, in a way. But lie d
always loved beautiful things, and had re-
garded the world as something to live for,
not ’n He’d always wanted to do something,
'o stand out from his fellow men. With suffi-
cient money to laze through life, and not
enough to gain authority, he’d done nothing.
And when he aired his views here the laugh-
ter nearly drove him mad. Oh yes, he
Ck ‘ thought
thS someone appreciated him Poor Elaine!
Whv the devil did he come here after
night’ To listen to this rubbish, and to
earn the odious title that he . knew was
fastened to him! Still, if ie: jorne<l one of
these Art clubs, these centres of Higher
Thought, what would be the result? A lot
of decadent individuals trying to prove that
everything should be drawn in cubes; say-
ing how they adored some string of rubbishy
words without sense or metre written by
some chap with the audacity to call himself a
poet; and talking about life as if Sex was
the only thing in it!
Or the other sort, where one sat in a
darkened room and made out to believe that
your grandmother’s spirit was talking to
you; where they asked you impossible ques-
tions about the future state of your soul,
questions that were almost indecent! They
were cranks, the whole lot of them.
But the world, even if it did laugh at them
and attempt to pull their theories to pieces,
gave them a certain standing, called them
“gifted.” Wasn’t there any happy middle
path? Must one be either a crank or a clod
endowed with a certain amount of low cun-
ning?. ... Oh well, only another instance of
the damnable stupidity of men in general!
With successive whiskies and sodas, his
pity for himself deepened; and he sat
morosely while the room began to empty.
Presently he shook himself and sat upright.
He must go now, Elaine would be expecting
him. He left the room.
Said Rackshaw from the depths of his
chair, “Poor old Durell, I suppose we are
hard on him. H'e’s not such a bad sort.”
“Oh, the man means well,” answered Bar-
ron testily; “but he is such a crushing bore,
with his high-flown ideas! If he’d had to
knock about a bit, he’d have seen how ab-
surd they all are.”
With an air of ending the matter old
Torlot grumbled: “The man’s mad.”
“Perhaps so, but he thinks us a fine lot of
fools, and, if you’ll excuse me saying so, he
thinks you lead them!” Torlot’s political
opponent spoke sharply, and the battle was
0n....
The bore entered a bedroom, and sat on
the edge of the bed. A woman, once beauti-
ful but bearing the marks of the permanent
and suffering invalid, gazed up at him.
Poor old John! She’d always known that
he was one of the great—even when, as a
weedy and timid young man, she had mar-
ried him. She’d been happy... .and then
came the day when she knew she’d never get
up again. John had been wonderful to her :
but still he’d found time to make the world
love and admire him. His opinion carried
such weight. He’d told her of all his suc-
cesses; and, although she didn’t read the
papers, she knew how much his world de-
pended upon him. Not that he wasn’t
modest • but he knew how she loved to hear
of what he had done. It always gave her
new life and, somehow, hope; without John’s
success, she didn’t believe she’d ever have
lived through the long excruciating years.
Dear John! She smiled lovingly at him.
“Have a nice evening at the club, dear?
And her husband, with bitter misery in his
soul, answered: “Yes, Elaine, splendid. The
whole fine crowd of them were practically
hanging on my lips. Old Torlot started an
argument with me; I don’t think he’ll do it
again. You see, it was like this ....
Complaint.
Fate, ’twas in thee to have made me wise;
But I, a foolish thing,
Was put beneath the ancient skies
To take what time might bring.
So gotten with what hopes and fears,
As a goat of the field
I crop the herbage of the years,
And get what they may yield.
However others themselves flaunt,
However wise they be,
Mine, it seems, is a spectral haunt
Which few, if any, see.
Yet being what I am, I must
Still to thought’s tether cling
Till, as the wisest, to the dust
I go, a foolish thing.
Till over me somewhere the sod
Will freshen with the rain,
And I may be as a dream of God
That He has dreamed in vain.

AT the card table, cocktails
give an added zest to the
game and relieve the
monotony of a hard-played hand.
And a dash of Benedictine gives
added zest to the cocktails. Then,
when the card party is over, you
can serve Benedictine as
a Liqueur and create a
fitting atmosphere in
which to review the
events of the game. Its
delightful flavour and
exquisite bouquet will
leave your guests with
memories of a pleasant-
ly different card party.
Benedictine was discovered by the Monk Vincelli in the
year 1510. In addition to its undisputed superiority as a
"Liqueur, it has highly valuable tonic and digestive qualities.

Grey Hair is always taken to be a sign
of age or worry, and in a woman, especi-
ally if she be in early years, amounts to
a tragedy. A woman should never let
herself go. The signs of youth should
always be protected. The well-known
preparation, Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut
Stain, removes all trace of grey. It is
easy and safe to apply and can be done
in the privacy of the home.
Tints to any required shade.

WHAT DO YOU STAND TO LOSE?
You have some investments. Maybe it is no more than a fire- or car-insurance policy. h you have
an accident, will you be paid? In a Sydney Court a few days ago it was shown that policies for large
amounts had been issued by a co. which couldn’t pay a loss of 5/-.
The Wild Cat Monthly is a complete guide to the investor great and small.
It will cost you 2/- per month, or 22/6 p.a., posted. It may easily save you hundreds.
One man wrote last month: The Wild Cat’’ Monthly’ saved me from putting my money into a rotten
insurance company four years ago. I took out instead a policy in a co. which I now know to be sound.
To-day, if I wished, I could not get another insurance policy, my health having suffered meantime; so
you can understand what gratitude I feel towards this Monthly.”
The Travel Game.
IN WHICH MARGARET FANE
AND HILARY LOFTING SHOW YOU
WHAT WONDERFUL THINGS YOU CAN FIND IN THE ’LOO.
IT being a Tuesday night old Sam Alderton
had a bit of a wash after his tea and
arranged a couple of dozen “folders” on
his table even more carefully than usual. lie
was sitting looking at them when he heard
Marty’s footstep on the stairs.
“Well, where is it to be to-night, Sam?”
Marty asked, lighting liis pipe.
Sam clnfckled and pulled a blue-and-gold
“folder” nearer to him. “Well, how is it
if we go to Venice to-night, Marty?”
“Venice? Yes, that sounds good. Let’s
have an evening in Venice.”
Marty liked this. There was a faint-
hearted tradition that he went round to
Barge-street on Tuesdays to cheer old Sam
and give Mary a chance to get the weekly
books made up; but in reality he liked it
and looked forward to it. To-night, while
old Sam read and talked in his droning way,
the small bedroom vanished; the store and
the ’Loo and the hill of Darlinghurst faded
from conscious memory. In a gondola he
and old Sam drifted into the Canalazzo
on the tide of the gondolier’s murmuring
voice. The Lions lifted their heads in the
moonlight to hear the song, and hard-faced
old Doges came down the water-steps to
peer in silence. Music was lurking in.
dark doorways, and murder raqjjd swiftly by
in a shadowed gondola; priests and bishops
turned down their thumbs and navies came
storming into the Adriatic. Shipbuilding
apd glass making jostled the music and the
sound of the lapping water in the canals.
Palaces glimmered up, white and gorgeous,
into the night while Sam and Marty went
softly by; great poets laughed in the arms
of love and died; dim rich churches glowed
in their twilight. Silken banners heavy with
gold floated against the stars: a sort of
rich tapestry of life, mingled with cafes
and hotels, singing voices, pigeons, a bridge
over which prisoners walked to death. Aus-
trian armies pouring in thunder into narrow
courtyards of bloodshed and shame marched
in stately pageant through Marty’s tobacco-
smoke. It was dark on this waterway, yet
the yellow buildings were bright and the
long sweep of the Adriatic blue as a
sapphire; you climbed midnight stairs above
the water and yet the sunshine glittered on
everything; the music never ceased, nor the
silence, nor the thunder of history.
“You see, Marty”—old Sam carefully
closed the book and reached for another
“folder”—“if you left the ship at Naples
you’d cover pretty near the whole of Italy
before you got to Venice. You’d go by
an Orient” —he opened the booklet and
smacked his lips—“a fine 20,000 tonner, and
you’d put in at Colombo, Suez and Port Said
before you weighed anchor in Naples Bay.
First Melbourne, then Adelaide and Fre-
mantle, and then the high seag for Colombo
and Egypt. The ship would haye quietened
down by then, and you could smoke your
pipe peaceful on deck and begin to enjoy
your trip.”
Marty knew well the note of steady in-
spiration in Sam’s voice. For years he'd
heard him mapping out journeys to the other
end of the world. His table and the little
bookshelf were full of guide-books and travel-
books and hundreds of “folders.” Every
Tuesday night lie went somewhere and took
Marty with him, and when he got into his
stride this note came into his voice.
“I was always a great one for travel,
Marty. Travel broadens the mind, as the
saying is. And sitting here and working out
a trip I-can tell that that’s true. It does
broaden the mind. Seeing the same old
things every day is no good to you: you
want to get out and see all you can before
it’s too late. Then you’ve got a chance of
comparing one thing with another.” He
was looking down the middle column of the
book while he was talking. “Going up Italy
overland from Naples you’d touch Rome and
Florence and Bologna before you got to
Venice. You can arrange to stop a day or
a day and a night at each place and see the
sights. You’d get all that foreign life”....
Sam had never been out of Australia—
never been out of the ’Loo, to Marty’s
knowledge. But that didn’t matter; he’d
been pretty nearly everywhere in the world.
He had his room in Barge-street, and his
guide-books; ordinarily he was wistful and
pale, a gentle sort of cove who mostly
wanted to be left alone. Well on in years,
he was too; but, like his wistfulness, that
seemed to vanish when he was at this travel
game. He got young and confident, in a
way; and yet Marty somehow felt sorrier
for him sometimes on Tuesday nights than
when he was just walking about the ’Loo
getting a bit of sunshine, like any other old
cove. His travel game was so much to him;
Marty often thought it was too much to him.
But now his steady old voice was taking
Marty through a prist of Tuscan battlefields
and sloping fields of corn to the valley whose
heart is Florence. At the gates of this
austere queen of the imagination the two
old men in Barge-street paused.
“First,” Sam was saying, his eyes on the
thumbed book and far away watching the
Lung’ Arno, “you get an idea that Florence
is a gloomy sort of a place. There’s a lot
of big buildings and it’s all terrible old.
There was Dante and Michelangelo and
Galileo, and a raft of old things, which at
first seems sorrowful. But it’s all in the
way you look at it, Marty; you’ve got to
remember that when you’re travelling—it’s
you that’s looking at it all and feeling it,
and you must get it right. Sometimes these
places look as if they’d built themselves up
on sorrow, as you might say'; but there they
are, working hard, and there can’t be much
wrong with them, if you give your mind to
it.”
Following as best he could old Sam’s ver-
sion of the Italian words and names, Marty
set out on a new tide in the travel game,
fetching up at Dante watching Beatrice in
the dusk and Michelangelo lying on his back
painting the ceiling of a church. It was all
tjerrible old and dead long ago, as Sam had
said; but it came to life again while he was
talking and working out the spending of the
daylight hours. Marty sat placidly smoking
his pipe, watching Sam and ambling gently
round picture-galleries and cathedrals with
him. He was fond of Sam, and he’d known
him a good few years now
Sam’s voice ceased. For a moment he
looked at the book in silence before he
'turned round to look at Marty.
“I wonder if I’ll ever get to any of these
places, Marty,” he said, a new note in his
voice. “Ever since I was a youngster I’ve
meant to get away this year or next year.
But something always happened—l’d lose
my job or be sick for a week or two or
something and I’d have to put it off. But
I never lost hope—l haven’t lost it yet, in a
way. 0n1y”....
Sam hadn’t a hope, Marty knew. But “Oh,
you’ll get there yet, Sam,” he said com-
fortably.
“I dunno. I dunno. I used to think I’d
get a chance from my Uncle Jim. He’s a
bachelor like me, and he told me once he’d
leave me all he’d got. But I haven’t seen
him for twenty years and he’ll have forgotten
all about it, I expect. He’s terrible old, for
another thing.” Sam’s eyes looking at
Marty slowly regained their faith in lit'e, if
only as armor. “I got to go on hoping,
haven’t I? If I didn’t there wouldn’t be
anything in it, would there?”
A wistful uncertainty in Sam’s voice made
Marty repeat “Oh, you’ll get there yet” with
great heartiness.
Sam turned back to the book. “What they
call the Florentine lily isn’t only a flower,”
he began, and Marty settled back to listen,
While the room filled with the dim glories
again. The room was small, but what a
raft of things it could hold!
Going home through a silent, dark ’Loo
that night—it might have been any other
place—Marty remembered that uncertainty
of Sam’s. Never before, in all the years
he’d known him, had he been anything but
full of confidence that next year (or next
month) would see him all set for Europe.
It was what kept hi n going. He’d never do
it—it wasn’t reasonable to expect that an
old cove in the ’Loo was ever going to
drop into a trip to Europe. That would be
too much luck.
But old Sam needed the certainty that
he was going, and he hadn’t got much,
living in that bit of a room all alone. You
couldn’t call him one of the lucky ones ; and
if the one thing he’d got was going—why,
it would be too much of a rough spin, Marty
thought, letting himself in very quietly so
as not to wake Mary.
But you never know the way tilings’ll
turn out. Marty was wrong about Sam
not being one of the lucky ones, as Mrs.
Kavanagh told him on the Monday. Mrs.
Kavanagh’s weary smile was almost
animated.
“Yes, his uncle,” she said. “Timothy or
some such name—over 80 he was, Marty.
Time ’e went off, if you ask me.”
Sam’s Uncle Tim ! Marty couldn’t believe it.
“I don’t suppose it’s any fortune, you
know,” Mrs. Kavanagh went on. “But it’ll
be enough to see old Sam Alderton out in
comfort.” She turned to the door. “Some
people have all the luck, don’t they, Marty?”
she added, smiling again as she went out.
Half dazed, Marty went up the steps into
the back room. Mary had already heard the
news.
“Yes, Miss Libby was telling me this
morning,” she said. “It’s a nice piece of
money and it’ll be a fine thing for the poor
man. He’ll be able to take this wonderful
trip of his now, I suppose. But what makes
ye look as if ye’d seen a ghost, Marty?”
“Do I, Mary my dear? I was thinking
of Sam and his travel game.”
“I suppose ye were, and we talking about
it. But that’s no reason why you should look
like a wet week, is it?”
“No, Mary my dear,” Marty told her
mildly, and went down the steps into the
shop again.
Everybody took it very calmly, he thought,
which was vaguely unsatisfactory. Not until
he arrived in Barge-street on the Tuesday
night did he feel that the news had been
treated with anything like its due respect.
Old Sam was entirely satisfactory. He
was flushed and bright-eyed, full of breezy
confidence and energy. H'e had a new suit
on, a Qollar and a slightly emphatic tie; and
he was obviously occupied with important
business. His lifelong friends, the travel-
books, were in two neat piles on his table,
and his bookshelf was empty.
“Started me packing, Marty,” he said,
nonchalantly waving his hand towards these
scars in the old room. “I’ll be off soon now.
How about a glass of beer?”
He was going to do that Venice trip for
a start, he said. There was a good deal
of money all told, but it didn’t all come to
him at once, “some legal jiggery-pokery”
being the explanation of its arrival in in-
stalments.
“But* that’s all right, Marty,” he went on,
a certain largeness informing his personality,
"you feel that you’ve got a few quid in
hand that way. And there’s enough spot
cash for Venice and a bit over. How about
another glass of beer?”
No dim glories filled the little room to-
night, but so much excitement was there
that the absent glories were not missed,
Sam couldn’t sit still; he’d got his complete
Venice itinerary by heart, and walked about
the room reciting it to Marty, who rejoiced
to listen to it. Fancy old Sam able to get
off at last, after all his years of hoping!
“Second class, Marty—l’d only be un-
comfortable if I tried to be flash. And I’ll
go ashore at Colombo and have a look at
these temples they talk so much about,
Then there’s Suez—that was a wonderful
bit of work, that canal; it’ll do my eyes
good to see it, after reading about it here
for donkey’s years. And Naples—l told
you about Naples one night, didn’t I,
Marty?”
Marty nodded, but Sam told him all about
Naples again this night, and Bologna, and
some more about Florence. He wanted Marty
to look after his books for him while he was
abroad ; he wondered if the Passport Office
would hold him back at all; and he gave
Marty the address of Uncle Timothy’s
lawyers before he forgot it—“just in case,”
he explained. He’d be going to Paris for
his next trip—might go on from Venice if
the cash was right, he thought. H'e told
Marty all about Paris.'
In the end Marty looked at his watch,
blanched, and went home.
Sam’s actual packing was steadier. He’d
had time to get more used to everything,
Marty could .see. He was quiet about it,
and almost silent; his face was grave and
preoccupied as he carefully folded under-
clothes and trousers and shirts and laid them
in the tin trunk. He seemed to be thinking
of something else, and something that
“wasn’t too clever” from the look of him.
But Marty wasn’t prepared for the white,
half-terrified face that finally stared round
at him from the closed trunk. “I suppose”
—the old voice was trembling—“l suppose
you couldn’t come with me, Marty, say as
far as Fremantle—see me out of Australia
like?”
Marty was going to laugh, but watching
Sam’s face he changed his mind. Poor old
Sam! He’d been thinking and reading and
hoping—making plans for himself here in
Barge-street all these years; and now, when
he could do it, he Marty shifted uncom-
fortgbly in his chair. “I don’t know what
Mary’d have to say about that, Sam. You
see, there’s the shop and all to think of.”
Glancing at Sam’s miserable eyes he fell
silent.
“Do you good, Marty man,” was what
Mary had to say about it. “You need a
change.”
Marty remembered that on his first night
at sea. Do him good!
But he wasq’t as bad as old Sam, who
hated life and everything in it. It wagi't
only the sea-sickness—he’d soon get his sea-
legs to tackle that—it was trying to fix
himself up and not knowing how he was
going to get on m these places, and S
such an awful long way to go. „
“Oh, you’ll be right in a day or t >
Marty told him. “Think of your travel ga
and yourself that you re all set at
last.” . , , ■
But Sam wasn t right in a day or two.
He drifted wistfully round Melbourne as it
he was scared of the buildings and tlie streets,
and he seemed to get thinner and palea,
though he had got his sea-legs by now.
“I suppose such a thing as a mug o beer
in Florence’d be like asking for Kingdom
come!” he said, hitching his deck-chair
over a bit out of the wind.
“Well, they’ll have some sort of liquor
all right, Sam—wine or something.”
“Yes.” Sam looked darkly at the sea.
“But it won’t be a mug o’ beer.”
Marty lit his pipe. He was here seeing
Sam out of Australia and looking after him,
and Sam wasn’t any too good up to now.
“I reckon it won’t be too easy getting any
sort of tucker, not knowing the lingo, Marty,
A man could starve if he didn’t watch out,
I expect. And there’s all that stuff in the
picture-galleries and churches—you wouldn’t
know where to start, and you couldn't ask;
not so’s they’d understand, could you?”
Sam got forlornly to his feet. “I’ll go
for a bit of a turn round the deck, Marty,”
he said. “And then I’ll go to bed—if you
can call it bed.”
Marty tapped out his pipe when it was
finished, and sat in thought for a few more
minutes before he too went down the com-
panionway to bed.
“You’d get terrible tired, too, with all that
walking about,” Sam murmured sleepily from
the top bunk. “G’night, Marty.”
At breakfast Sam was a bit more talkative,
“Of course it’s a great thing to be going
to Europe after all these years, especially to
a place like Venice that I’ve always Seen
fond of, Marty. It’ll be a fine trip for me,
and I’m looking forward to it.”
“Of course you are. Have a chop or a
bit of steak after your porridge?”
Sam looked at the half-eaten porridge.
“No,” he said. “The porridge’ll be enough,
I used to be good at my food, but lately I—
well, as I was saying, a man really enjoys
every minute of a trip like this, Marty. It’s
—well, it’s interesting to be aboard ship, for
one thing. And then there’s all that new
foreign life to look forward to”—the por-
ridge was still only half-eaten, but Sam
rolled up his napkin and put it in the ring
—“and when a man’s got a chance of dodg-
ing round the world at last he doesn’t want
to waste any time in grumbling or getting
scared of anything 0r”.... His voice trailed
away. He seemed wistfuller and frailer than
ever this morning; his eyes looking through
the saloon doorway out to sea were listless,
Marty finished his breakfast, went out on
deck and dropped into the chair beside Sam.
“Have you ever had any trouble with your
heart, Sam?” he asked abruptly, looking
gravely into Sam’s face.
“My heart? No. My heart’s as right as
rain—all of me is. Why ?”
“Well, I don’t like the look of you some-
times. You look to me like a man with a
bad heart, Sam, and that’s a fact.”
Sam laughed. “I tell you I’m as right as
a trivet, Marty,” he said scornfully,
“Well, there it is,” Marty went on filling
his pipe with deliberation. “I thought I’d
warn you.”
Presently he heard Sam’s quite unscornful
voice. “I suppose if a man did have a bad
heart a trip to Europe wouldn’t be too good
for him, Marty, would it?”
“I should think it wouldn’t,” Marty said,
lighting the pipe.
“Well, then,” there was quite a kick in
Sam’s voice now, “let’s see—we reach Fre-
mantle to-morrow, don’t we, Marty? Some
time in the morning, they said.” Sam stood
up with considerable energy and spirit for
a man with a bad heart. “Come down to
the cabin, Marty. I want to talk to you,”
he added vigorously.
“Righto, Sam.” Marty’s face was per-
fectly serious as he got up and followed Sam.
“Overland’s better, I think, Marty,” Sam
said, settling comfortably back in the rail-
way carriage. “Of course, life aboard ship
is all right, and we can feel that we’ve done
a bit of sea-travel. We’ll be able to remem-
her that later on.” Sam opened the news-
paper. “But you can’t beat the train, I
don’t believe. We’ll break the journey at
Melbourne and have another look at it—l
didn’t seem to get the strength of it coming
over.”
They spent a day and a night in Melbourne.
In due course a taxi stopped at the store
in Brazier-street back in the ’Loo and Marty
got out.
“Tell him to go on to Barge-street, will
you, Marty?” Sam said. “You’ll be round
on Tuesday night, won’t you? I was think-
ing if we spent the evening in Singapore it’d
be interesting. I believe I’ll take a trip
there later on.”

AS WE SAID BEFORE
This Page will be devoted week by week to reproductions of the
gems in picture, story and verse published in “The Bulletin of last
century, so that pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and
a new generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
Il’api Moko, an old Maori chief, has jiist
died. In 1886, whilst on a whaling cruise
on the M.L. coast on board a Riverton
whaler, Hapi took ill and, to all appearance,
died, and was duly sewed up in canvas, ready
for burial at sea. In those days the whalers
took their wives on board, and they, as
usual, were far more affected by the death
than their lords and masters, and protested
against his burial at sea, preferring that the
body be kept for a few days longer till they
reached terra firma. The vessel put into
Riverton, and the body being taken on deck
to be put in the boat for removal ashore,
was in process of being handed over the rail,
still clothed in the canvas bag, with the
weight at the feet, when, lo and behold!
Hapi Moko b.gan to stretch himself. This
naturally produced extreme excitement,
especially among the females, and it was a
considerabl 1 time before anyone had the
presence of mind to undo the package. Hapi
Moko was taken ashore, and lived, only to
die 52 years later like an ordinary mortal.
A story has been going the rounds of a
Hungarian woman who kept herself within
doors for 30 years, as a self-inflicted punish-
ment for going out to a fair after promising
her sweetheart that she would' not do so.
That narrative has its parallel in a prosaic
suburb of Sydney. Let those who are inclined
to indulge in a little sentiment take the
Newtown tram, and when opposite the
skating-rink a little distance this side of
the Missenden-road they will see above a
large hoarding the roof of a house in which
for 34 years a woman kept herself a prisoner,
watching and waiting for a lover who never
returned. Some 37 years ago Miss Flora
D. was a beautiful and wealthy girl, residing
with her father in that old-fashioned house.
She was engaged to be married to a man
who has since risen to high rank, and is
now in England, if he be alive. One night,
in Miss D.’s home, they had a quarrel over
the usual weighty matters that set lovers bv
the ears, and Mr. N., as he was going out,
remarked, “Flora, when this door closes on
me to-night it closes on me for ever.” Miss
D. caught the door ere he could shut it and
called him back in vain, for he came no more.
She stopped at the door all night saying,
“The door must not be closed, he will return.”
Next day, seeing the futility of all entreaties
to her to come away, her father agreed to
have the door fixed so that it could not be
closed. A carpenter was called in, the fastep-
ings adjusted, and so it remained year in
and year out, that the parable of the foolish
virgins might not be again fulfilled. Another
doorway had to be cut at the side of the
house, and the front door was never used
again. Some three years ago Miss D. died,
aged about 58, but up to the day of her
death if she heard any noise in the front
a servant was despatched at once to see
whether Mr. N. had come, or if anyone was
meddling with the
dooi\ The house
has been deserted
for some time, but
it stands to-day a
mute witness to
the fidelity and
patience of a
foolish, tender-
hearted woman.
There have been
a good many
hilarious scenes in
old Bendigo, . but
the wildest, mad-
dest riot of them
all was one which
took place in the
Camp Hill lock-up
in the roystering
days of 185(3.
Smith; of Long
Gully, had been
found selling
brandy without a
license, and the
police gallantly
seized upon his
stock and bore the
vendor away to be
pent in a dungeon
as the reward of
liis misdoing. The
thrilling situations
which follow hinge
on a seizure of the
liquor of the afore-
sa i d Smith of
Long Gully. The
brandy, of which
there were half a
dozen cases, was
stored in a com-
partment adjacent
to the Camp Hill
lock-up, a draughty,
unpretentious
structure, built
almost entirely of
logs, and consist-
ing of two strong-
holds, one devoted to male and the other to
female prisoners. Each consisted of a single
room, and both were well filled with occupants,
the roughest products of a very rough time.
The brandy had not been in sequestration
many hours before the women succeeded in
enlarging a hole in the dividing wall and
prising open a convenient case. Bottles of the
liquor were passed between the logs and the
other partition into the men; these bottles
were straightway beheaded, and in half an
hour the drunkest crowd that ever howled was
raging in that Government department. A
log was levered out of the dividing wall, the
prisoners all crowded into one compartment,
and the little pandemonium sustained its
violence for some time, and, armed with
empty bottles, it held the fort against 15
troopers till the arrival of the inspector with
reinforcements, when the men were quelled
and reduced to subjection. Such of the
ladies, however, as still retained their loco-
motory powers made a break for liberty, and
stampeded over the district, clpsely followed
by the minions of the law and cheered on by
the hilarious spectators, to whom this joyous
episode afforded the wildest delight. Most of
the women were ultimately captured, and
carried, kicking, biting, scratching and scream-
ing, back to “the logs.” The men were tx-ans-
ferred to another abode, and next day the
magistrate, Bendigo Mac., made it extremely
hot for the crowd —a pleasant little way he
had, as many old residents still remember.
Spirit-level—Dead drunk.
A touching story comes to us of one
MeTavish, whose study of Darwin convinced
him that, with care, any living organism
might be educated to adapt itself to new
environments. He commenced by experiment-
ing on a herring, which he kept in a tub of
sea-water. He renewed the water daily for
some time, and gradually reduced the quan-
tity with so little inconvenience to the her-
ring that he concluded that the fish might
in time learn to breathe air undiluted with
water, like the cat and the man. It turned
out as he expected, and the water was finally
turned out of the tub,- never to be replaced.
MeTavish next removed the fish from its
tub and placed it on the ground, where it
flopped about awkwardly at first, but soon
learned to move freely and rapidly. In a
little while the herring was able to follow
its master without difficulty, and then it
became his constant companion about the
streets. On an unfortunate day MeTavish
had occasion to cross a dilapidated bridge
which spanned an arm of the harbor. The
herring coming gracefully along, heedless of
danger, now and again springing at the
ephemera, for which it had acquired an
especial fondness, missed its footing, slipped
through a crack into the water beneath, and
was drowned. Mac at first was disconsolate,
but is consoling himself by training a
flounder to spend his evenings on roller-
skates.
A STRONG ARGUMENT.
BROWN (the wag, to Shentmore ): “Look here, why don’t you
spend some of that money of yours? You know you
can’t take it away with you, and if you did it would melt.”
A certain Australian Judge went to Eng-
land some time ago suffering from severe
illness, the result of overwork. When he
arrived in Bull-land his state of health
became worse than ever, and, having been
assured on most eminent medical authority
that it was quite unlikely he would ever
recover, he sate himself down and indited a
long and dismal letter of final farewell to his
brother Judges, in which lie said, among
other rather sultry things, that, though he
could not hope to be remembered as a great
lawyer or as a great Judge, he hoped to be
thought of as one who had always tried to
act as a courteous and kindly gentleman (the
fact being that his Honor had always tried
to do the square thing, but had been cele-
brated for a darned snappy temper—mainly
caused by ill-health). The Chief Justice got
the letter in course of post, and then handed
it to Mr. Justice Ventosior, who snorted
characteristically, and passed it on. By-and-
bye the body of the Judge came to Australia,
not in a box, but in the saloon of the mail-
steamer. It was in first-class working order,
accompanied by its soul, and it now takes
its little three meals a day. However, it
will be long ere the C.-J. and Mr. Justice
Ventosior cease to chaff their learned col-
league about his last dying speech and con-
fession. Moral: Never write your own
obituary.

GILHOOLEY'S ESTATE.
(A ballad concerning the amalgamation of the legal
professions. )
Oh, Mr. Gilhooley he turned up his toes,
As most of us do, soon or late;
And Jones was a lawyer, as everyone knows,
So they took him Gilhooley’s Estate.
Gilhooley in life had been living so free
’Twas thought his possessions were great 1 ,
So Jones, with a smile, says, “There’s many
a fee
For me in Gilhooley’s Estate.”
They made out a list of his property fine,
It totalled a thousand-and-eight;
But the debts were nine-hundred-and-ninety-
and-nine—
The debts of Gilhooley’s Estate.
So Mrs. Gilhooley says, “Jones, my dear man,
My children have little to ait;
Just keep the expenses as low as you can
Against poor Gilhooley’s Estate.”
But Jones says, “The will isn’t clear in its
terms,
I fear it will need some debate,
And the law won’t allow me (attorneys are
worms)
To appear in Gilhooley’s Estate.”
So a barrister-man, with a wig on his head,
And a brief in his hand quite elate,
Went up to the court where they bury the
dead,
Just to “move” in Gilhooley’s Estate.
But his Honor the Judge said, “I think that
the joint
Legatees must be called to prolate —
Ex parte Pokehorney is clear on the point—
The point of Gilhooley’s Estate.
ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS.
POLITICIAN (to applicant for Government billet ): “My good man, I would do as much
for you as if you were my own brother!”
APPLICANT ( joyfully ): “Oh, Sir! I never expected such kindness.”
POLITICIAN: “But, my good man, I would do nothing for my brother!”
“I order a suit to be brought just to try
If this is correct that I state —
A nice friendly suit, and the costs, by-and-bye,
Must be borne by Gilhooley’s Estate.”
From Barristers’ Court there’s a mighty
hurrah
Arises both early and late:
It’s only the whoop of the Junior Bar
Dividing Gilhooley’s Estate.
THE BANJO.
AN INSUPERABLE IMPEDIMENT.
She’s fair, she’s bright, she’s good,
Has land and gold in plenty;
With talent she’s endued
And she is not yet twenty.
She has a graceful form,
Her eyes are grey and lustrous,
Her heart is pure and warm,
Her temper never blustrous.
Right mellow is her voice,
Most gracefully she dances;
My heart she doth rejoice
By her approving glances.
She loves me well, I know,
And very oft I’ve kissed her....
But we mayn’t churchward go,
Because —she is my sister.

-AND THE CAR
WILL MEET YOU
ON LANDING
This is our plan: write to
us sometime before you sail
and let us know, when you
arrive in England and the
make and type of car you
prefer. We will send you
a price list of suitable cars,
but before you buy, we
guarantee to repurchase the
car at a mutually agreed
price. The car you choose
will meet you at the landing
stage complete with licence,
driving licence and, if you
wish, you may have the
services of a uniformed
driver for three days
without charge. The car is
yours —absolutely, until you
re-sell it to us, at the agreed
price, when you return.
This is our guaranteed re-
purchase plan. It is infinitely
cheaper than hiring and,
because it is planned with a
sure knowledge of what is
helpful and necessary, you
will find it infinitely con-
venient. May we show you
the details of this service?
They are awaiting your
enquiry. Write in good time.

W. CHARNLY
TELLS THE B,TORY AS THE OLD BARBER TOLD IT
TO HIM.
THEY EE pulling her down at last,
though it isn’t milch pulling she needs
~ at T^. r J , a *-‘ ie she’s been standing
there, I itt.v years I should say; perhaps a
little more. Built of good hardwood she was
—hardwood scantling and weatherboard ; all
got from the slopes of Mt. Buninvong, and
all sawn up m Irving and Glover’s old timber-
.vard, where most of Ballarat came from
ni those days. See the size of the uprights—
timber was cheaper than saws in those times.
1 hat s how she’s stood so long.
Now they’re going to build a fine brick
church there. Not that that’ll do my business
much good; a church is dead all the week
und only open on Sundays, when I’m closed ;
but that don’t matter, seeing that she’s been
closed up this last ten years—ever since old
Colin Scott died. Good land going to waste,
as you might say.
But I suppose It takes money to build a
church, and there wasn’t any of these modern
parsons would take on the job of preaching
and trying to make a living in such a
ramshackle old place. Besides, old Mr,
Smeaton held the miner’s right for the
land, and he wouldn’t part with it for fear
someone might use the site for a pub or
a dance hall, he got such a fright in old
Grover’s time.
I suppose you never heard of old Grover
and the way he jumped a church? An old
demon he was, though he could pull the wool
easily enough over the eyes of Colin Scott.
But anyone could do that, old Colin was that
trustful. The simplest looking bloke I ever
saw in my life was my verdict when I first
met him, and I was only a kid of eight.
He came in the door here one day when
I was minding shop for the old man.
‘ls your father in, Sonny?” he asks.
‘"I'll get him,” I says.
Dad was in a room at the back of the
saloon playing poker with Ned Clay and Jack
Duff and someone else I don’t remember, so
I got it warm when I shoves my head in
and tells him a parson wants to see him.
‘‘Tell him to go to Il’ell,” he snaps, being
annoyed at losing a few bob to Ned Clay,
who was a first-rate spieler.
So I tells my mother there’s a parson in
the shop and she goes to him —-women gener-
ally have a weak spot for parsons.
“I’m thinking of trying to start a little
church and Sunday-school in this neighbor-
hood,” he explains, “and, though I am not
seeking any money, I am endeavoring to
gather some advice and a little moral sup-
port. A church, if I may say it, appears to
be somewhat needed in this locality.” He
added that last with a bit of hesitation.
My mother agreed and I agreed too, though
I was only a kid. But I understood life,
and in a place where there was a pub on
nearly every corner, and where there wasn’t
a pub there was a dance-hall, and what with
men getting “shick” and coming home and
raising hell’s delight and turning their wives
and kids out into the cold, I reckoned some-
thing was wanted to straighten things up.
Not that my old man ever slopped over, him
being a gambler and not a drunk, but big
Paddy Brown, who lived in the street at
the back of us, did, and I was a bit sweet
on Mary Brown and, kid-like, felt sorry
for her.
“I have some money for the building and
now I need a block of land,” the parson
explained.
“How much have you got, if I may ask?”
my mother says.
“Four hundred pounds,” he tells her, simple
like. “Hardly enough to purchase land and
pay for the building, so I suppose I will have
to remain in debt for that.”
My mother considered for a moment. Then,
“No; you needn’t,” she said. She was a
business woman was my mother. “See that
block of land across the street there. You
can get that for nothing; it’s been held for
years by Sam MaeCorkill, but he’s dx-ank
himself to death, and no one else has
taken it. up yet; so if you go and apply for
it by miner’s right you can hold it as long
as you like for a pound a year.”
This was new to the parson, and it took a
bit of explaining, he having tlie notion that
all town blocks were freehold. But lie
soon caught the idea, and then my mother
sent me with him to show where the Regis-
trar’s office was, and she told him to be
quick or someone else might get wind of it.
“I want to build a church on this land.
Will that be legal?” he asks as the clerk is
filling in the miner’s right.
“Do what you like with it,” answers the
clerk, “so long as you live on it a quarter
of the year and keep up the payments.”
“Colin Scott is my name,” my parson then
explains, “and I am a priest of the Church
of England.”
When I got back home I found the old
man growling because he hadn’t been put wise
in time so that he could have taken up the
block and then soldi it to the parson. “You
had your chance,” says my mothei-, “but you
preferred your cards instead of attending to
business. And, anyway,” she finishes, “I
wouldn’t come in on a thing like that,
because I want to see the church built.”
She didn’t have long to wait, for the very
next day along comes Irving and Glover’s
waggon and dumps a load of timber on the
spot. Inside a month the church was up:
twice as big as Colin Scott had first intended
to build her, though the job left him a
hundred pounds in debt. Then he rang the
bell himself the first Sunday morning and
stood at the door waiting for people to come.
Surprising the number he got; women
mostly—women had a pretty rough spin in
Ballarat when I was a kid and they sort
of went to church for comfort. We were
there, my two brothers and me, with my
mother and the old man; she got him to go
for once—he generally did what she really
wanted him to.
I remember, the sermon Colin Scott
preached that morning: the first in his new
church. He called it “The Miner’s Right”—
made that his text. He was a bit of a poet
was Qdin, and somehow the thing appealed
to him as romantic. Some men, he said,
were granted miners’ rights to seek for gold:
lie was going to seek for gold, but it was
the gold in human hearts and especially in
the pure hearts of little children. "Suffer. little
children to come unto Me, for of such is the
kingdom of Heaven.” Heaven was a place of
gold, he said; and by virtue of his miners
right he would lay up treasure there.
That got most of the women, and they went
away saying what a wonderful preacher he
was; which he wasn’t, since he had a bit
of a stutter that might have kept him back
in the big churches.
In the afternoon he held Sunday-school.
We went. We didn’t want to go, but the old
man had a greenhide razor-strop and he had
suddenly become seized with the idea of
doing his duty to us. “It’ll do you no harm
if it don’t do you any good,” he argued,
“Better for you to be there than prowling
around back lanes watching two-up schools
and drunks fighting.” So with the greenhide
strop behind us we went to Sunday-schooi
regular.
And we soon got to like it. Old Colin —he
was young then, though—was a kids’ man;
he could sit and tell stories by the hour and
he got us interested. And all the time, though
we didn’t know it, he kept pumping us about
our homes and how we lived! Especially the
kids whose fathers or mothers got drunk.
Some of the kids had pretty tough homes.
You hear a lot of praise of the old pioneer.
Well, fifty per cent, of him may have been
all right, but of the other fifty per cent,
half must have escaped from Van Diemen’s
Land and the other half ought to have been
there.
I’m no wowser, mind you, though I say
that; I put on the bag down at the Miners’
Course and I ran a tote in this old shop
until the police stopped me; but I could never
stand those terrible old drunks who seemed
to be everywhere when I was a kid.
There was old Martin Roper, for instance
—he'd drink the blankets off his children’s
beds only they didn’t have any; just bags.
And he’d have drunk the boots off their feet
only they didn’t have any of them either.
He’d do or sell anything for drink, and him
with six children! The eldest boy was Lep,
and when Lep turned thirteen he cleared, off
and got a. job with a cocky. Christmas-time
came, and home comes Lep with a cart and a
ton of flour on it. Lep had saved up all
his wages and bought it as a Christmas-box
for his mother. “There you are, Mother,”
he says, “a whole ton. The old man won’t
be able to sell that for drink and you’ll
always be able to make bread for the rest
of the kids.” Naturally Lep’s mother is proud
of that and tells the news around, and soon
Colin Scott gets to hear of it. Then he goes
looking for Lep and asks him to come to
church. But he can’t go because, having
spent all his money on flour, he hasn’t got
any decent clothes ; though he wouldn’t admit
that. But Colin Scott understands, and next
day along comes a delivery-van with a full
rig-out—a new suit, boots and all: no
note nor anything to say who sent it. The
Reverend Colin was like that; he kept him-
self poor by giving things away and saying
nothing about it. He never could refuse;
any old poverty yarn got him. Sometimes
it’d be a week’s food for a widow’s family
or boots for some drunk’s: kids, or perhaps a
few bob for the drunk himself so that he
could get his tools out of pawn and start
work again. Such parsons don’t exist, yon
say. Well, they may be a bit rare, but
old Colin Scott ’ was one. That’s how he
came to fall to this old Grover I was going
to tell you about.
Well, Grover was caretaker to the church.
He’d just come out of gaol, where he’d been
doing ten years for scrip forgery, when the
Reverend Colin gave him the job. Grover’s
wife begged for it so' that he’d have a bit of
a chance to make good again—caretaker to
a church seemed to be such a respectable
job.
My old man used to grin at Grover doing
the caretaking. But he got himself up well
for the part; always wore a suit of black and
pulled a long face, which he naturally had,
being no handsome bloke at any time. “He’s
a flyme bloke is Grover,” my old man used
to say. “And Mr. Reverend’ll need to watch
him or he’ll pinch the church.” The old
man, of course, knew all the spielers and
flyme blokes in Ballarat—and Melbourne for
that matter, and he never could believe that
old Grover had turned straight.
But the Reverend Colin would never hear
anything against his caretaker. “A change
of heart is possible in any man,” he would
say. “Grover has suffered his punishment
and now he is different. I have discovered
the gold in him even as it is in the hearts
of other men.”
But us kids didn’t swallow that because
we knew that, for all his long face and
black suit, Grover still beat his wife. Us
kids used to hear him jawing at her when
we’d be playing along the back lane behind
the church where he lived, and sometimes
we’d hear him give her a smack. Cruel old
devil he was, because as time passed on—
and I’m speaking of time, for it was a
matter of years that Grover was caretaker
to Colin Scott’s church: well, as time went
on Grover’s wife became crippled, and then
he was ten times as hard on her as he had
been before. But only us kids knew —we
used to listen at the back fence. And when
I grew up into long pants and chucked up
Sunday-school and took to prowling down
the main road into the Chows’ camp—seeing
life as us young bloods thought—hanged if
I didn’t used to drop across the same
Grover. I saw him many a time playing
in old Ah Loo’s gambling den half the night;
then he’d sneak away up west and next
day he’d be the good religious caretaker again.
But old Colin Scott couldn’t see through
him, and his poor sick wife never made any
complaint.

—a young woman. “She needs a young
woman, a strong young woman to lift her
about,” Grover explained when some of the
other women began to sniff. Perhaps she
did; but, anyway, the other women had
Grover summed up pretty well, because a
month after Mrs. Grover died I’m hanged
if he didn’t turn to and marry the servant.
He had to, it seemed. It caused a scandal
in the church, and, though old Colin was
forgiving enough to pass it by, the women in
his congregation weren’t. “Judge not lest ye
also be judged,” he said.
But the women had already done the
judging, and they reckoned Grover ought to
be shifted out of his job as a disgrace. They
held a meeting in the church to consider the
matter, and then they got the Reverend Colin
to call Grover in so that he could receive
the official sack.
But those women didn’t know Grover.
“He’s a flyme bloke,” my old man used to say.
“Watch him.”
Grover sprang his surprise on them at
once: “Put me out of here, would you; put
me out of my own property !”
“What do you mean?” asks old Colin,
taken a little aback by Grover’s cheek.
“Your property! This church and the cot-
tage you live in belong to me.”
Grover grinned. “Did once on a time,
but now they belong to me. How long is
it since you paid up your miner’s right?
Here’s mine.” And he pulls out his miner’s
right.
That was a La Blanche punch all right.
Grover had jumped the church.
Poor old Colin sat there with his head
going round and round. He’d forgotten the
date when his miner’s right expired—rhe’d
often forgotten it before; but this time
Grover had kept watch and, hopping in,
had taken out a new’ miner’s right, which
gave him the land and everything on it.
“But you couldn’t do such a thing!” says
the Reverend Colin. “You wouldn’t rob
me of my church, Grover?”
“It won’t be a church much longer,”
Grover replies. “I’m going to make it into
a dance hall —that’ll pay better. And now
I’ll trouble all you people to get out.”
And out they had to get, for, although
they tried to argue, Grover had the whip
hand over them; he had the miner’s right
for the land, and, being caretaker, he was
legally set, since he had fulfilled the resi-
dential qualifications.
The church people made a fuss about
it. Old Colin had a pretty big congregation
by this time, and they raised a fighting
fund and engaged a lawyer. But it wasn’t
any good—the old mining law stood pat:
the land was held under a miner’s right
and was jumpable any time the license
expired, and Grover had jumped it. Then
the church people and old Colin offered to
pay rent, but Grover was too spiteful to
agree to it. “No! I’m damned if they’ll get
it,” he says. . “I’ve had enough of psalm-
singers and Bible-punchers. I swore I’d
turn it into a dance hall, and a dance hall it’s
going to be.”
It cost old Grover a bob or two to turn
the place into a dance hall. The floor wasn’t
much good; it was not tongued and grooved
and it had shrunk with age and warped a
good bit, so he decided to have it up and
put down kauri pine-kauri, you know,
makes the best dance floor in the world.
Where he got the money from set everybody
thinking, but I guess he must have been
tickling up the collection-plate for years.
Anyway, he got the carpenters in and down
went the flash dance floor—the best in
Ballarat, he skited. Then he got ready for
his grand opening night. Across the front
of the place he had a big sign painted,
“Bellevue Quadrille Assembly.” That was
reckoned stylish those times. And double
gasoliers put in, so as to make the hall
like day; electric light hadn’t been thought
of in Ballarat then. “I’ll show them what
a proper dance hall ought to be like,” he says.
Of course, us young chaps went with our
skirts. We didn’t mind old Grover turning
the church into a dance hall. Dancing was the
popular pastime in those days; there being
no moving pictures or tennis or any of
these new stunts, we all went dancing, some
of us six nights a week. The parsons used
to denounce dance halls as Hell, and some
of them certainly were pretty hot joints—
that’s what made it so sore on the Reverend
Colin, turning his church into one, although
I’ll say he was no wowser and didn’t mind
dancing when it was well conducted.
The opening night came and a great crowd
of us rolled up to try the new floor. I
knew the inside of the old church pretty well,
as you may guess, me having been there
many a year to Sunday-school, and I got
a bit of a shock when I stepped through the
door. The new floor was done up just like
a mirror, all waxed and polished until it
shone and was as slippery as an eel’s skin.
Around the walls he had put the pews,
making good, comfortable seats, and, as I
have said, the place was lit up like day.
But what gave me the knock was the altar.
It was just .as the Reverend Colin had left
it: the cross- still standing on the com-
munion table and the words “Holy, Holy,”
done in gold letters on each side, and in the
front the pulpit where the reverend used
to preach. And all along the front of the
altar is a buffet, this being a social dance for
the opening, with plenty of bottles —whisky
and beer for the men, wine and lemonade for
the girls. Grover meant to treat us well
and get his hall a big name for a start. He
had good music there, too, a first-class
pianist and a couple of violinists.
Eight o’clock was the time to start, and at
eight o’clock old Grover set her going.
Mounting the pulpit he raps us all to order.
“Ladies and gentlemen.” he begins, “before
we start our festivity I want to preach you
a little sermon, not a long, dreary one like
our late parson used to preach”—of course,
us coots had to laugh at that—“but just
a few words to tell you that the Bellevue
Quadrille Assembly is gping to be the freest
and easiest little dance hall in Ballarat, and
that’s saying something. And before we
begin I want you all to charge your glasses
and drink with me to the success of the
Bellevue Hall. The stewards will now serve
you With drinks.”
Inside a few minutes we all had something
in our glasses, and Grover begins again:
“This pulpit I have kept here for the M.C.
I will be him and I will call you the figures
as you dance. The communion table I have
kept there, and any lady or gentleman who
feels the need of a little refreshment can step
up and have some.” That made them laugh
again. “And now, ladies and gentlemen, a
toast with me. ‘Success to the Bellevue
Assembly, once the abode of pious misery,
now the abode of youthful pleasure.’ ”
But most of us hardly heard him; we
were watching the Reverend Colin, who had
just come in the door. Most of us had for-
gotten about him —with his church gone he
seemed a bit of a joke and a back number.
Grover, I think, had quite forgotten about
him ; anyway, I expect he didn’t think that a
parson would be game to come and face a
dance-hall crowd.
But old Colin was game enough for any-
thing. In the door he came and straight up
the centre of the floor, not taking any notice
of us whatever. Grover seemed to turn green
when he saw him coming.
In front of the pulpit old Colin stopped
and, lifting his hand, he pointed a finger at
Grover. “Blasphemer,” he said, “do you not
fear that God may strike you? You have
stolen the house which He gave me power to
build for Him, and now you mock Him at
His altar.”
Grover’s eyes goggled for a moment; then
he burst into a rage—the sort of rage he
got into when he used to hit his poor old
wife.
“To Hell with you!” he yells. “Chuck
him out, boys,” he calls to us, “and chuck
liis God with him!” And to start the riot
he jumps down from the pulpit.
It was only a couple of steps high, but
somehow as he touched the floor his feet
seemed to slip and his legs crumpled up
underneath him. Then he looked at us silly
for a second and fell over on to one side.
Heart disease, the doctors reckoned, and
over-excitement. They said he had suffered
from a dilated heart for years, and instead
of looking for excitement should have taken
things easy; if he’d kept on with the care-
taking job he would have been all right.
The Reverend Colin got his church back,
.although he wouldn’t have managed that if
it hadn’t been for Mr. Smeaton, who, know-
ing the law, got down early to the Registrar’s
office next morning and applied for a new
miner’s right on the block, beating my old
man to it by a short head. And ever after
that Mr. Smeaton kept the title good so that
old Colin could go on digging for his gold
in human hearts without further worry.
My kids all went to his Sunday-school
when they came, and hundreds more. A
dinkum digger was old Colin Scott. He died
at eighty-seven.
Apalachicola.
Our riding light is winking
On a cold fore-stay,
The morning star is blinking
In the dawnlight grey ;
Her hawse-chains are clinking;
And we’re bound away
For Apa-lachi-cola,
Down by Mobile Bay,
Across the Western Ocean we must wander,
O’er the wild Atlantic we will go,
For an awk’ard load that is waiting yonder—
The rough-hewn spars that the builders
know.
The Gulf Stream warmly leaping
On its nor’-east run,
And green isles softly sleeping
In a lazy sun,
We’ll see by Apalachi
Ere our last log’s done.
Across the Western Ocean we will wander ;
O’er the wide Atlantic, storm or shine.
For a fine rich freight that is waiting
yonder,
A full, deep freight of the red pitch-pine.
The Glasgie men are greeting
In their dour Scotch way;
And a hard voice is bleating
On the Tyne and Tay,
Where hammers loud are beating
On the rib and stay.
To Apalachicola
We are bound away.
Across the Western Ocean we must bring
her,
O’er the wide Atlantic we will go,
For a rougli-hewn freight (in the roads to
swing her)
Of good red pine that the builders know.
Our grog we’ll all he drinking,
Down in Mobile Bay.
Our glasses we’ll be clinking,
As the banjos play;
So have done with sad thinking,
My lads, and away!
He can sing like a ’cello,
Our smart stevedore,
He’s a fine, famous fellow,
Afloat or ashore,
With a face quite as yellow
As any moidore.
Across the Western Ocean we have found
him,
O’er the wild Atlantic, all in line,
With his gay nigger-gang that works around
him,
To stow our freight of the red pitch-pine.
Back on the Western Ocean we will wander,
O’er the brave Atlantic, storm or shine,
Bringing the freight that we won over
yonder,
Our deck-deep load of the red pitch-pine.
Her riding light is burning
On a stiff fore-stay;
The money we’ve been earning
We will spend to-day.
Back from Apalachi,
On the old salt way,
From Apalachicola,
And sweet Mobile Bay.
Across the Western Ocean we have wandered,
O’er the wide Atlantic, storm or shine,
With a deep, full freight from the pine woods
plundered,
A braw fine freight for the yards of Tyne.

EYES should be

IF the whites of the eyes are light and bright
with just a pleasing tinge of blue, your health
is probably right. But let eyes show the least
sign of discolouration, let them be dull, and it
means bad health—constipation and liver trouble.
Constipation causes poisons to accumulate in the
system which give rise to biliousness, lack of
energy, indigestion and other ailments.
The best treatment is the corrective action of

OU WANT MORE THAN TRANSPORTATI
If transportation in a limited
sense were all that an auto-
mobile could provide, any
car would do, and the
cheapest would be the best.
The difference between the
minimum in transportation
and the maximum in motor-
ing is exactly what sets the
Chrysler-built De Soto Six
completely apart from others
in its field.
De Soto Six was not designed
merely to carry people in
passable comfort from one
place to another. The quali-
ties that afford De Soto true
distinction are all supple-
mentary to its mobility.
Enjoyment goes along with
utility. De Soto Six has style,
stability, speed, smoothness.
It is flexible to a degree never
before achieved in a car of
its price. Its comfort and
luxury of appointment are
self-evident. Safety and ease
of control are assured by
weatherproof internal ex-
panding four-wheel hydraulic
brakes.
De Soto Six is capable of
such distinctive and versatile
performance that nothing
less than a demonstration
can do it justice. We shall be
glad to arrange a demonstra-
tion of your own choosing
to suit your convenience.
