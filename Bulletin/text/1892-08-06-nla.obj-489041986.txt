ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OF ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS:—
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST

SIN OP OMISSION, PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILD

INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OT &:RS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO

SATURDAY, AUGUST (J, 1892.
The Prospects of Victoria.
Victoria’s annual balance-sheet, as set forth
last week by Treasurer Graham Berry, is
about the saddest document of its kind ever
published in Australia. There is hardly one
promising feature in the whole record ; it is
all insolvency and desolation and weariness
of spirit. The shortage for the year is some-
where between £1,750,000 and £2,000,000,
and what the shortage for next year will be
like no one knows. The revenue has fallen
off by something like £950,000, and it is still
falling ; the liabilities left behind by the
Gillies-Deakin Cabinet are still turning up
periodically, and owing to the astonishing
system of book-keeping practised by that
deceased coalition the end of them cannot
be foreseen ; and the general disaster which
has descended upon the country makes new
taxation a matter of uncertainty, for the
estimated proceeds shrivel up unaccountably
in the process of collection, and everything
groAvs smaller by degrees, and beautifully
less. The amount of available loan money
on hand is exactly £58,000 ; and in addition
to all these troubles three old loans, amount-
ing to £3,419,900, fall due within the next
eighteen months, and as they cannot pos-
sibly be repaid out of revenue, the country
must either raise new loans xvith which to
pay them, or file its schedule. As the latter
idea is impracticable, the country will
naturally raise iicav loans, and under the
pressure of hard necessity will raise them
on any terms which the British money-
lender chooses to impose. Also, there
is hunger and bankruptcy in the land,
and the unemployed Avant relief, and the
Government has no relief to offer ; and there
are broken banks and rumours of banks that
are going to break all round, and that in-
visible thing called “credit” seems to be
dead beyond all present possibility of resur-
rection. There never was in Australia a
Government whose prospects looked blacker
than those of the Skiers’ Administration,
and though that Cabinet is attacking its
difficulties with an energy which is little
short of heroic, it Avill take years of toil to
restore even a semblance of genuine pros-
perity in Victoria.
The one unfailing resource, when New
South Wales or Queensland drifts into prac-
tical insolvency, is to raise money by the
sale of public lands. New South Wales, in
particular, collects nearly 2| millions per
annum by dissipating the public estate, and
every time the country strikes upon a snag
the difficulty is surmounted by dissipating
the public estate a little faster than usual.
But Victoria, owing to its limited area, has
no such resource, and what lands remain
unsold are mostly in remote and mountain-
ous regions where every £1 worth of pro-
perty requires to be opened up by £2 worth
of railway to make it saleable. Therefore,
the province has practically reached the
point where it must rely on its own people
and on its own resources-—the point which
Maoriland reached some ten years ago, and
which New South Wales will definitely
arrive at some ten or fifteen yeats in the
future, and Queensland just a little later.
The people of Maoriland, by dint of a whole
decade of patient endurance, economy, and
hard, incessant labour, have got over the
difficulty, and as their reward, the province
is now prosperous, solvent, and independent
of the British money-lender, axxd—uxxless a
new generation of wild-cat politicians get
into power to resurrect the Vogel policy
—it seems likely to remain so for ever.
There is no earthly reason to believe that
Australia will recover its equilibrium oxx any
easier terms. If Victoria will abjure foreign
loans, land-booms, and baxxking, axxd be coxx-
texxt to live by hard digging and shovelling
for the rest of this century, it will become
prosperous, but there is no other way by
which the result can be arrived at. And
the other provinces, when their public laxxds
are all sold, must go and do likewise.
* * *
Yet Victoria is, in reality, very little
poorer now than it was four yeax’s ago, and
it had very little more promise four years
ago than it has now. The barren suburban
allotments which formed the capital of which
the boom was constructed are still there, and
are no more barren than they were before.
The waste paper which used to be the sciip
of the Real Estate Bank, and similar institu-
tions, is still to be found in the dust-hole or
the paper mill, and it represents just as
much actual value as it did at any time since
it first existed —it was waste paper all along,
and the only difference is that the owners
have now at last become aware of the fact.
In the days of affluence a man who owned
a scrap of suburban land, honestly worth,
perhaps, £lOO, would sell it for £5OOO, and
receive the value in the alleged securities of
some shoddy institution ; and then one man
would consider himself rich because he had
the land, and the other because he had the
securities ; and when the collapse came the
only thing that was really lost was the child-
like credulity of them both. The loss that
Victoria has suffered is not in money but in
self-reliance. The nation left off working
in that intoxicated period when every man of
ordinary intelligence, and gifted with a
reasonable amount of dishonesty, could live
on credit by buying things that didn't exist
and paying for them with money which he
didn’t possess, or by trading in paper, and
giving bills, and purchasing allotments on
time-payment from one dupe and selling
them oxx bills to another. Melbourne was full
of “ financiers,” and banker's, and mysterious
pei’sons who lived by hanging round in offices
and calling themselves “agents,” and the
working classes—the miners, agx’iculturists,
and artizans, who are the only producing
sections of the community—supported them
all. Also, it is supporting most of them yet.
Thomas Bent shows no signs up to date of
going back to rear cabbages at Brighton, and
Matthew Davies, James Munro, and a
hundred othex-s of their kind, have evinced
no intention of I'eturning to any description
of reproductive labour. In fact, until the
old, hardened bankers and financiers are
dead or are driven out to do fencing jobs in
the wilderues?, there is not much hope for
the future.
* # *
Probably it is a brutal thing to say, but as
the bi’oken-down financier never docs take
to fencing for a livelihood, Victoria is wait-
ing now for Munro and Bent and the rest
of their oi'der to be dead. It doesn’t
care much how they die, but it wants them
to bo dead anyhow. The cui’se by which
the country is weighed down is the great
multitude of non-producers, and this multi-
tude, which was much too great before the
land-boom and bogus-bank period, increased
enormously dui’ing that era of fevex’ish un-
rest. Unfortunately, too, it is easy to
convert the pi’oducer into a non-producer,
and exceedingly difficult to convert him back
again. The landlords, lawyers, “ bankers,”
brokers, “ financiers,” merchants, pawn-
broker's, clerks, betting-men, jockeys, com-
mission agents, professional “ dii’ectors,”
canvassers, hawkers, dealer's in quack medi-
cines, mining agents, speculators-, auctioneers,
bagmen, and the like, who were ci'eated by
the boom, are legion, and the country is no
longer able to support them now that the
borrowed money has given out. Therefoi’e,
they must go to hard, monotonous toil, or
else the country must wait till they are
deceased and out of the way. It must be
content to see Melboux-ne stop its process of
expansion for many yeax-s to come, and grass
grow in the streets of many once prosperous
country townships. It must give up boi’X'ow-
ing, and give up railway extension, and
pile up one tax upon another—land taxes,
income taxes, property and absentee
taxes and ‘the like —till, in some way
or other, revenue and expenditure arc
brought together. And, above all, it wants
to put many of its leading financiers out of
the way in the calm seclusion of a gaol; to
put the banking business under such cast-
iron restrictions that there will never be
another “ land bank ” started in Yictoi’ia ;
and to close up, by the shortest and cheapest
process which can he devised, the few insti-
tutions of the kind which still survive, for
the sufficient reason that it is a useless
expense to keep alive a crowd of incurables
that are neither ornamental nor useful.
Whether the remaining “land banks” are
solvent or otherwise is a question that has no
bearing upon the case. They only exist by
buying and selling that which can be bought
and sold equally well without them, and as
they produce nothing, therefore they must
of necessity live upon the producers, whose
burdens are already more than sufficient.
* * *
Unfortunately Treasurer Berry, despite
the vigour which he has brought to bear
upon his task, has omitted the one measure
which, above all others, he ought to have
adopted. He proposes to increase the duties
upon a large number of articles and thus
to reduce the amount spent annually
on imports ; to curtail the over-grown Civil
Service ; to cut down or abolish a large
number of more or less useless grants, and
to levy a special tax on the rich absentees
who impoverish the nation by drawing
large revenues from a country where money
is already much too scarce. All these expe-
dients are highly commendable—especially
the last, which is more like the daring,
resourceful Berry of past years than the
wasted dandy who bears that once-honoured
name. But the idea of imposing a ponderous
tax upon the unimproved values of laud, and
an especially heavy one upon all lands that
are held for purely speculative purposes, was
apparently beyond him. Victoria wants such
an impost more almost than anything else.
If it were sufficiently weighty it would
abolish those vicious institutions which live
and make their dividends by holding land
for a rise ; and it would be almost fatal
to the land-booming industry, for the
process of inflating land-values on paper
would become comparatively profitless when
the increased paper valuation only meant an
increased tax in gold to be paid into the
Treasury. Sir Graham Berry wants money
at the present moment worse than almost
any other politician in Australia, and if he
has not courage enough to get it by this
device, then the democratic party--provided
such a thing exists in Victoria—should make
him give way to some one whose nerve is
equal to the crisis. Is there any Victorian
statesman who will venture to make this the
rallying cry of the democracy at next
election ?
The Shelley Centenary.
Percy Bysshe Shelley was born on August
4, 1792, and people all over the English speak-
ing world are celebrating his hundredth
anniversary. Why they do thisit is hard
to say, for the vast majority of those
in the forefront have little sympathy
with Shelley and his consistent message to
the world. At the present moment a strange
spectacle is presented to our sight. Here are
the gilded flies that fatten on corruption, the
parasites, the unnatural line of drones who
heap toil and penury on those who build their
palaces and bring their daily bread ; the
cowards who crouch ; the men whose grandeur
is their own debasement; the priests and states-
men who blast the human flower in its tender
bud ; the hoary-headed hypocrites who, through
lives of luxury and lies, have crept by flattery
to scats of power; the sellers of justice;
the tramplers on truth ; the overthrovvers
of nature’s land-marks ; the heapers of
fraud-accumulated gold against whom Shel-
ley thundered throughout the whole of
his short life, leaguing themselves together
to celebrate his centenary. Can anything be
stronger evidence of the ingrained hypocrisy of
the age? Nothing except its nominal adherence
to Christianity, the doctrine and spirit of which
it wilfully disobeys and unblushingly violates.
Shelley was a man so far before his age that
even now, seventy years after his death, he is
still generations ahead of us. The words he
wrote in 1819 are as true now as in his own
time: —
Have we learnt this lesson yet? And, in this
day when the Broken-hillionaire is astride of
his “ freedom of contract ” crocodile—
Shelley was a genuine republican : no
truckler to any mob, or disposed to ignore the
practical difficulties in the way of a r T
position of power, but fully convinced thv '
must be redisposed because justice so denia
It would seem that the republicans of to',l ’
and the true party of progress, do not rea£
what a heritage they have in Shelley’s works
His terser and more direct utterances should 1
as household words to everyone who h-is i,„ be
for the future. - * AS
Men of England, wherefore plough
For the lords who lay ye low ?
Wherefore weave with toil and care
The rich robes your tyrants wear?
Wherefore feed and clothe and save,
From the cradle to the grave,
Those ungrateful drones who would
Drain your sweat, nay, drink your blood?
Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,
Shelter, food, love’s gentle balm?
Or what is it ye buy so dear
With your pain and with your fear ?
The seed ye sow another reaps ;
The wealth ye find another keeps ;
The robes ye weave another wears ;
The arms ye forgo another bears.
Sow seed, but let no tyrant reap ;
Find wealth, let no impostor heap ;
Weave robes, let not the idle wear ;
Forge arms, in your defence to bear.
... To work and have such pay
As just keeps life from day to day
In their limbs as in a cell
For the tyrant's use to dwell.
... To hunger for such diet *
As the rich man in his riot
Casts to the dogs that lie
Surfeiting beneath his eye.
. . . To see the children weak
With their mothers pine and peak
When the winter winds are bleak.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Boomer Who Doesn’t “Get Left"
If you mean never to “ get left ” bv any boohv
burst, never pay down hard cash of y o iw
own, but recklessly take all available fi rs p
robber’s chances, Let the “ Uncalled capital ’'
of your companies run into
ciphers > let the hahies of your promoters be
those of high public standing, no matter how
hollow the reality of their reputations ; let the
interest offered to the certain gnlls be dazzling
in its attractiveness. All the snares are then
well-limed. Next, provide for your own abso-
lute irresponsibility by a bogus institution that
has ‘‘ no uncalled capital. ” Thus : You take up
50,000 shares in the Never Never Bank, at £3
per share—£lso,ooo ; also 50,000 shares in the
Way back Investment and Agency Co., at £2
per share—£loo,ooo. Total, £250,000, consist-
ing entirely of “ uncalled capital.” This would
be a fearsome contingency to have as a spectre
at your daily board, so you immediately form
the Crowbung Trust Co., with an alleged capital
of £250,000, fully paid-up (on paper), The
Crowbung Trust Co. spiritedly takes off your
hands 49,000 Never Never Banks, and 48,000
Way backs, and you remain the advertised
holder of only £3OOO worth of scrip of tire
former and £2OOO worth of the latter—looo
shares of each, in uncalled capital. By writing
off £5OOO, as “preliminary expenses, commis-
sion, &c.,”you convert this into fully paid-up
shares. Now, you sit at the receipt of custom
and offer anything from 9 to 100 per cent, in-
terest. The gulls pour their money into your
coffers, and you convert every paper document
into hard, yellow sovereigns, or transfer it into
a safe and legitimate bank whose enterprise
never soars above to 5 per cent, on deposits.
If you are canny and married, you will settle
much of this loot (say, £100,000) on “ the old
woman.” Then you take a foreign tour and wait
for news of the smash. It comes with more or
less suddenness. All the Never Never and the
Wayback uncalled capital can be squeezed to
the last gctatable penny out of the less
“ thrifty ” shareholders, but you are safe, for
did you not “stand” the “preliminary ex-
penses ” and are not your shares fully paid-up?
Also, the Crowbung Trust Co., being/«% paid-
up, and having no uncalled cajntul to levy oil,
simply closes its doors and effaces itself with
“ assets, nil.” Your only chance of being
“ victimised ” by an evil fluke is that the Never
Never and Wayback smashes involve the
collapse of the “safe and legitimate ” bank in
which you yourself trusted. But, even then,
you can fall back upon the nest-egg which you
thoughtfuliy laid for “ the old woman.”
Tire Cat v. The Whip.
“ Rivulet ” sends us from Perth, W.A., par-
ticulars of the barbarism that provoked from
the Attorney-Ceneral of that province his
round robin to the magistracy, impressing upon
those functionaries that, when aboriginals are
sentenced to be whipped
Under no circumstances whatever should any other
instrument than the “ Cat-o’-nine-lails lie ustd, unless
it be some description of whip ( other than a stockwhip),
or a birch rod : a rope, or a stick of any kind or sort must
not on any account be used, and a magistrate allowing a
native to he whipped with either of such last-named in-
struments will incur very grave responsibility, and render
himself answerable for tiie result cf ins acts.
The scandal that moved official sluggishness
was the punishment at Carnarvon, W.A.,of
two natives, convicted of sheep-stealing and
sentenced by two J.’sP. to imprisonment ami 25
lashes apiece. The two niggers were triced up
to the corner-post of a stockyard, their bands
made fast to the top-rail, and their legs bound
with stirrup-leathers to the bottom-rail. The
flagellators were two brawny bullock-drivers,
who used 14 wattle-sticks, each Oft. long and
2 inches round at the thickest end, striking
blow for blow. The highly-respectable J. sir.
superintended the castigations. W.A. magis-
trates will kindly note that, for the future, their
tortures must be limited to the use of the
regulation number of strips of hide, sun-clnec
to the consistency of iron rods ; or—yes, there is
an “or”—or they may use “some description o
whip,” so long as it is not a “ stockwhip ”—say,
the regulation number of strips of hide, phi e
and knotted into a devilish “ toby.” The gooi
old Imperial system still poisons Australia
soil, and is more shamelessly visible in “ cs
Australia, the latest ticket-of-leave meinei,
than in any other province. In glorious JNo'
South Wales, also, the Minister for Justice pi
poses to revive flogging carnivals in the va
hope that official brutality will scare o
larrikinish horseplay. Ugb !

is evidently strong in Melbourne, for, desp

and fraudulent balance-sheets, and false rep

twice its value, and swore that the institutions
were sound when they were tottering to their
final fall —haven’t even gone insolvent. Most of
theiiij so far as all available evidence goes, are
quite happy. Not one of them has been
a rrested, or seems likely to be arrested,
pi fact, nobody seems to have dreamt of
arresting them, any more than he would of
issuing a warrant for the arrest of Divine
providence. If anybody uses the mildest terms
of reproach about any of them, he is urged in
the papers to preserve a calm, judicial attitude,
and not give wa .Y uugentlemanly passion,
go far they have done those things better in
jj’ew South Wales. The halo that surrounds a
pig financier, in Sydney, has long since vanished,
and as the hanks break, the bankers go in
melancholy procession to the lockup, to explain
a s best they can the discrepancies in their
accounts. It is true that the Sydney bankers
have been a different class to those of Mel-
bourne ; they were coarser and more stupid in
their methods, and their steals were done in a
more idiotic fashion, and there was a cheap,
mean, old do’ aspect about most of them,
which was not to be found in the Victorian
brotherhood. But the banks all went broke
just the same, and the funds have vanished
quite as unaccountably in the huge, gilded
Melbourne institutions as in the low-grade
pawnshops of Sydney, and a good many bankers
in one province want to be gaoled quite as
badly as they do in the other. And mean-
while the Melbourne directors roll up peace-
fully at the meetings, and “ cheek ” the ruined
shareholders ; and instead of paying their
calls, or paying back their overdrafts,
or explaining why the balance-sheet shows a
big reserve fund when even the capital can’t be
found, they assume an offensive, go-to-blazes
attitude, and reproach their victims for not
having “confidence.” The present financial
situation in Melbourne is a noble spectacle.
Judging by appearances it would almost seem
as if the directors were thinking of arresting
the depositors, and unless the latter class stop
asking for their lost money and otherwise
worrying the moneyed potentates of the city, it
is difficult to guess what may not happen.
Tho Libel Laws.
The Sunday Times (Sydney) has drafted and
printed a Bill of its very own for the amend-
ment of the New South Wales libel law, and
bespeaks the consideration of its contemporaries
thereto. It submits that “proprietary jour-
nalism should not be made so ridiculously easy
as it is now,” and proposes that “before any
person is licensed to publish a newspaper inves-
tigation ought to be made into his character ;
and responsible securities should be fixed at an
amount” [£looo is suggested in the Sunday
Times hill], “bearing some adequate relation to
the vast responsibilities with which the appli-
cant desires to be endowed.” This is the sub-
stance of the first business clause of the Sunday
Times bill, and it is all that the real journalist
(as distinguished from the mere newspaper-pro-
prietor) who holds, as the present writer
ventures to do, that print should be as free as
human speech, and that a man should have
untrammelled liberty to circulate anything of
which he is prepared to take the consequences,
will care to read. The would-be newspaper-
proprietor may be a journalistic genius, but
with no character worth investigating ;
and if he is an experienced working jour-
nalist he is almost certain not to be
able to find responsible sureties for £lOOO.
If a man is to satisfy the law as to his character
ere he is allowed to run a newspaper, the Sun-
day Times bill would limit newspaper pro-
prietors to respectable tea-dealers and successful
liquor-merchants, like the present owner of the
Sunday Times aforesaid, but it might as fairly
be urged that no man should be permitted to
•leal iu tea, or barter away grog, unless he can
produce certificates of baptism, confirmation, and
church-marriage, and find sureties for the cool
thou, which Mr. Evans’ organ appears to regard
ns a guarantee of all the “respectable ” virtues.
When Henry Parkes used to live in the
empire office in Hunter-street, Sydney, and
was so pofflr and so pressed for time that, when
he wanted a meal, he would unhitch a hunk of
aeon from a hook suspended from the rafters,
saw off a slice with his paper-knife, and toast it
over the coals, how many sureties of £5OO apiece
were at his command? When The Bulletin was
started by people-who hadn’t a thousand shil-
uigs, how many persons would have gone secu-
ri y for them to the tune of £1000? Press experi-
ence proves that a newspaper training is the
est capital with which to start a paper. The
writer who has worked for years for the
enclerest of remuneration, and can scrape up
jns enough funds to keep himself from starving
or six months, has, in the result, a far more
w fie capital than that of the non-journalist,
si with thousands, who essays to run a paper

The Broken Hill Proprietary directors contend
that they have no wish to depress the earnings
of the miners, but that they desire to avoid
their liability to be robbed through the in-
efficiency of men who do not perform sufficient
work in return for the money paid them as
wages. If they loafed three-quarters of the
time wherein they are supposed to be hard at
work, even then the expenditure of 10s. a day
apiece, as wages, would not place the producers
and the shareholders on a level, as regards
returns for daily exertions, but that may pass.
To test the bona Jides of the directors in the
matter, let them agree to the insertion of a
clause in every contract accepted, which makes
it incumbent upon the contractor that he pay
nothing less than the union rate of wages and
ask no longer periods of labour than those
specified in the eight hours principle. If they
decline this, and permit contractors to make
their own terms with the A.M.A., then that
body will simply know what to think of the
Proprietary owners, who apparently seem to
consider (1) either that they are not realizing
sufficient profits on each 10s. spent in wages,
under the present arrangements ; or (2) that
the mine isn’t being worked out fast enough,
and that it is better to be earning £4 a day for
the expenditure of £l, than it is to be earning
£2 a day for the outlay of 10s.

The unionists, at Pittsburg, have formally expelled

The Kanakilgriffs new Standing Orders for
the Queensland Parliament are being proposed
for the special purpose of gagging Tom Glassey,
the labour-leader. Here are a few of the more
heroic rules for the chloroforming of obnoxious
critics A motion may be made that a member
“be not heard,” or “be not further heard.”
No motion for adjournment shall be entertained
except for purposes of definite debate of a
matter of public importance, and unless five
members rise to support it. No amendment
nor contingent motion on going into Committee
of Supply shall be entertained without leave of
the House. In Committee, a member shall not
move the Chairman out of the chair when the
Chairman rules (without debate) that such
motion is obstructive or inconsistent with order.
Ac any time, either in the House or Com-
mittee, and whether a member be speaking
or not, any member may move “That the
question be now put,” and the Speaker
or Chairman, if he deems the preceding
debate sufficient, shall put the question without
debate, and if two-thirds of the members
present, being also at least one-third of the
whole number of the members of the House,
vote for the motion, a vote shall be taken forth-
with. Any member refusing to explain or
retract objectionable words may be suspended
during the House’s pleasure. Also :
When the House has adjudged a person guilty of the
offence charged against him, the House may adjudge him
to pay a fine not exceeding £5OO, and, in the event of the
flue not being paid immediately, or within such time as
the House may allow, to be imprisoned in custody of the
Sergeant-at-Arms in such place as the House may direct,
or in Her Majesty’s gaol at Brisbane, until the flue has
been paid, or until the end of the existing session, or for
such shorter period as the House by the same or any
subsequent order may direct.
Gag and Mac. Gag! Will Griffithian dupes
pickle these rods for their own future chastise-
ment ?
In a late leader the S.M. Herald argued that
it is wrong for a trades-union to break a current
agreement with an association of employers, but
that it is perfectly justifiable for an association
of employers to give notice of their intention to
withdraw from a current agreement after a
certain date, because “ to give notice to termin-
ate an agreement is not a breach of it.” This
is straw-splitting with a vengeance. Of course,
the notice of intention to break the agreement
does not constitute the breach ; that lies in the
succeeding failure to complete the previously-
arranged contract, and all the Herald man’s
quibbling with terms won’t convince any un-
biassed mind to the contrary. But the Herald
holds a brief for the capitalist, and an advocate
always may console himself and placate his con-
science by reasoning that if he has distorted
facts, or even lied, it has been done in the
interests of a client, the justice of whose cause
on other grounds condoned the offence.

The desire to cover up things it ought to bring
to light is as strong in the Crown in Victoria
to-day as it was in the Crown that Gillies
represented. The men at the head of affairs
are not rogues, as far so one can tell, but they
are not strong enough in their own sense of
honesty to disown the roguery that is all around
them. Whilst they try to persuade the public
that they have not been playing with pitch,
they are making dirty finger-smears on the
clean sheet with which they have but recently
started business. There is no health in the
high court of Parliament at this time assembled.
A political job ranks as a virtue in a place where
flagrant financial fraud isn t regarded as a vice.
They elected a new Speaker in Tom Bent, and
he has scarcely flopped his unrespected person
into the Chair before the Argus draws attention
to the fact that the Government are proposing
to construct a new railway line with no con-
ceivable objects save the benefit of a Tom Bent
land syndicate, and the inflating of the value
of that La Rose Estate in order to hide the
fact that it was shoved on to Munro’s
bank at a false price. And this railway
scheme, which will seemingly be dropped out
of notice because a newspaper blew upon it, is
one of the first productions of a Government
entrusted with the bask of “restoring confi-

In Answer to “ Banjo,” and otherwise.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
HENRY LAWSON.
It was pleasant up the country, Mr. Banjo, where you
went,
For you sought the greener patches and you travelled
like a gent.,
And you curse the trams and ’busses and the turmoil and
the “push,”
Tho’ you know the “squalid city” needn’t keep you from
the bush ;
But we lately heard you singing of the “ plains where
shade is not,”
And you mentioned it was dusty—“all is dry and all is
hot.”
True, the hush “ hath moods and changes,” and the bush-
man hath ’em, too —
For he’s not a poet’s dummy—he’s a man, the same as
you;
But his back is growing rounder- slaving for the
“ absentee ” —
And his toiling wife is thinner than a country wife should
be,
For we noticed that the faces of the folks we chanced to
meet
Should have made a greater contrast to the faces in the
street ;
And, in short, we think the bushman’s being driven to
the wall,
But it’s doubtful if his spirit will be “ loyal thro’ it all.’*
Tho’ the bush has been romantic and it’s nice to sing
about,
There’s a lot of patriotism that the land could do with-
out—
Sort of British Workman nonsense that shall perish in
the scorn
Of the drover who is driven and the shearer who is
shorn —
Of the struggling western farmers who have little time for
rest,
And are ruin’d on selections in the squatter-ridden west—
Droving songs are very pretty, but they merit little
thanks
From the people of a country which is ridden by the
Banks.
And the “ rise and fall of seasons ” suits the rise and fall
of rhyme,
But we know that western seasons do not run on
“ schedule time ; ”
For the drought will go on drying while there's anything
to dry,
Then it rains until you’d fancy it would bleach the
“ sunny sky ” —
Then it pelters out of reason, for the downpour day and
night
Nearly sweeps the population to the Great Australian
Bight,
It is up in Northern Queensland that the “ seasons ” do
their best,
But its doubtful if you ever saw a season in the west.
There are years without an autumn or a winter or a
spring,
There are broiling Junes—and summers when it rains like
anything.
In the bush my ears were opened to the singing of the
bird,
But the “ carol of the magpie ” was a thing I never heard.
Once the beggar roused my slumbers in a shanty, it is -
true,
But I only heard him asking, “ Who the blanky blank are
you?”
And the bell-bird in the ranges—but his “ silver chime”
is harsh
When it’s heard beside the solo of the curlew 7 in the marsh.
Yes, I heard the shearers singing “ William Riley ” out of
tune
(Saw ’em fighting round a shanty on a Sunday afternoon),
But the bushman isn’t always “ trapping brumbies in the
night,”
Nor is he for ever riding when “ the morn is fresh and
bright,”
And he isn’t always singing in the humpies on the run—
And the camp-fire’s “cheery blazes” area trifle overdone ;
We have grumbled with the bushmen round the fire on
rainy days,
When the smoke would blind a bullock and there wasn’t
any blaze,
Save the blazes of our language, for we cursed the fire in
turn
Till the atmosphere was heated and the wood began to
burn.
Then w 7 e had to wring ourblueys which w 7 ere rotting in the
swags,
And we saw the sugar leaking thro’ the bottoms of the
bags,
And we couldn’t raise a “chorus,” for the toothache and
the cramp,
While we spent the hours of darkness draining puddles
round the camp.
Would you like to change with Clancy—go a-droving ?
tell us true,
For we rather think that Clancy would be glad to change
with you,
And be something in the city ; but ’twould give your
muse a shock
To be losing time and money thro’ the foot-rot in the
flock,
And you wouldn’t mind the beauties underneath the
starry dome
If you had a wife and children and a lot of bills at home.
Did you ever guard the cattle when the night was inky-
black,
And it rained, and icy water trickled gently down your
back
Till your saddle-weary backbone fell a-aching to the
roots
And you almost felt the croaking of the bull-frog in your
boots—
Sit and shiver in the saddle, curse the restless stock and
cough
Till a squatter’s irate dummy cantered up to warn vou
off?
Did you fight the drought and “pleuro” when the
“seasons" were asleep—
Falling she-oaks all the morning for a flock of starving
sheep;
Drinking mud instead of water—climbing trees and lop-
ping boughs
For the broken-hearted bullocks and the dry and dusty
cows?
Do you think tho bush was better in the “good old
droving days,”
When the squatter ruled supremely as the king of western
ways,
When you got a slip of paper for the little you could earn,
But were forced to take provisions from the station in
return —
When you couldn’t keep a chicken at your humpy on the
run,
For the squatter wouldn’t let you—and your work was
never done:
When you had to leave the missus in a lonely hut forlorn
While you “rose up Willy Riley,” in the days ere you
were born ?
Ah 1 we read about the drovers and the shearers and tho
like
Till we wonder why such happy and romantic fellows
“ strike.”
Don’t you fancy that the pods better give the bush a
rest
Ere they raise a just rebellion in the over-written West?
Where the simple-minded bushman gets a meal and bed
and rum
Just by riding round reporting phantom flocks that never
come ;
Where the scalper—never troubled by the “war-whoop
of the push " —
Has a quiet litlle billet—breeding rabbits in the bush ;
Where the idle shanty-keeper never fails to make a
“draw,”
And the dummy gets his tucker thro’ provisions in the
law ;
Where the labour-agitator—when the shearers rise in
might
Hakes his money sacrificing all his substance for the
right;
Where the squatter makes his fortune, and the seasons
“ rise ” and “ fall,”
And the poor and honest bushman has to suffer for it all.
Where the drovers and the shearers and the busbmen and
the rest
Never reach the Eldorado of the poets of the West.
And you think the bush is purer and that life is better
there,
But it doesn’t seem to pay you like the “ squalid street
and square,”
Pray inform us, “Mr. Banjo,” where you read, in prose
or verse,
Of the awful “city urchin ” who would greet you with a
curse.
There are golden hearts in gutters, tho’ their owners lack
the fat,
And we’II back a teamster’s offspring to outswear a city
brat;
Do you think we’re never jolly where the trams and
’busses rage?
Did you hear the “ gods ” in chorus when “Ri-tooral”
held the stage ?
Did you catch a ring of sorrow in the city urchin’s voice
When he yelled for “Billy Elton,” when he thumped the
floor for Royce ?
Do the bushmen, down on pleasure, miss the everlasting
stars
When they drink and flirt and so on in the glow of private
bars ?
What care you if fallen woman “flaunt?” God help 'em—
let 'em flaunt,
And the seamstress seems to haunt you—to what purpose
does she haunt?
You’ve a down on “ trams and busses,” or the “ roar ” of
’em, you said,
And the “ filthy, dirty attic,” where you never toiled for
bread.
(And about that self-same attic, tell us, Banjo, where
you’ve been ?
For the struggling needlewoman mostly keeps her attic
clean.)
But you’ll find it very jolly with the cuff and-collar push,
And the city seems to suit vou, while you rave about the
bush.
P.S.—
You’ll admit that “ up-the-ccmntry,” more especially in
drought,
Isn’t quite the Eldorado that the poets rave about,
Yet at times we long to gallop where the reckless bUshman
rides
In the wake of startled brumbies that are flying for their
hides ;
Long to feel the saddle tremble once again between our
knees
And to hear the stockwhips rattle just like rifles in the
trees !
Long to feel the bridle-leather tugging strongly in the
hand
And to feel once more a little like a “ native of the land.”
And the ring of bitter feeling in the jingling of our
rhymes
Isn’t suited to the country nor the spirit of the times.
Lee us go together droving and returning, if we live,
Try to understand each other while we liquor up the
“ div.”

Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works
voted £lOOO towards defraying Chairman Fitz-
gibbon’s ex’s, to London. Salary goi-ng on all the
time, of course, plus that of locum tenens. This
is the same body which is always talking so
pompously about saving the ratepayers’ hard-
earned cash.
“ Where are the Freetrade leaders ? ”
wails Sydney Daily Telegraph. Then it goes on
to answer its own question. M'Millan has gone
abroad. Carruthers pours out the everlasting
washiness of his eloquence in his own constituency
only. Bruce Smith has somehow vanished. Brun-
ker is as utterly invisible as if he had never
existed. Wise has dropped out of sight. Parkes
is sulking drearily at Balmain. Reid is practi-
cally a failure. It might have added that Abigail
is busy over a matter connected with a balance-
sheet, and the list would be complete. And now
we are waiting to hear the D.T. bang the spirit-
stirring drum once more and call on Parkes to
come back and lead the party to victory, and to
hear it explain away all the bad things it said
about the “ traitor.” We have all the “traitor”
leaders pasted up in our scrap-book.
It is a good, reliable sample of British gall
that the London Financial News should (as per
last week’s cable) take objection to the Dibbs
Government calling for tenders for steel rails and
the like “to be manufactured in the colony” on
the ground that the money ought to be spent in
England. The British cormorant doesn’t want
much when you come to look at it. He only asks
that these provinces should borrow just when
and how it suits him best, that they should pay a
higher rate of interest than he can get anywhere
in the United Kingdom, and that they shouldn't
get the cash when they have paid for it, but should
take it out in rails and locomotives and so on.
The true money-lender never wants to part with
the monish. When he has discounted the prodigal
son’s bill at sheventy per shent he always wants
him to take it out in cigars, bad wine, and sham
oil-paintings.
“ We have a great respect for the rights
of Property ourselves, but we do not think Pro-
perty should be put before Life or Liberty. We
do not all believe in the dual vote so strongly
advocated by the National Ass. ; because it not
only gives certain people a double vote in relation'
to their own property, but it also gives them a
double vote in relation to other people’s lives, and
howeverunequalmenmay.be in property posses-
sion they are all pretty equal in the possession of
life, and should be one and all equally entitled to
a say in the laws and conditions pertaining to it.
Because a man owns two houses, that isn't to say
he owns two lives, or that he should have two says
to one about another man’s life who owns no
houses.”— Coonamble (N.S.W.) Independent.
Someone has forwarded to this office a
copy of the “Australian edition” of the Sporting
and Dramatic Bits, which seems to be a com-
paratively new curse in a BITS-cursed land. It is
one of those papers which are made up almost
entirely of stolen literary matter and stolen
illustrations, and if they were printed on stolen
paper and the compositor were diddled out of his
wages it would only be in keeping with the rest of
the swindle. Even the “Notice to readers” in
the Sporting and Dramatic Bits now before us
is stolen—it is cadged from The Bulletin ; and
the alleged “Answers to Correspondents” are
cadged from The Bulletin likewise ; the miser-
able rag hasn’t one genuine correspondentof its own
in the whole list. This sort of thing is getting near
its end. The man who steals another man’s writings
is, from a moral standpoint, quite as much a felon
as the one who steals his watch, and the time isn’t
far distant when the whole tribe of Bits and
similar British rubbish will be seized by the Aus-
tralian police, and the persons who publish or sell
them in Australia will be sent to gaol for dealing
in stolen property.

SIC Macquarie-slreet North, Sydney, August J, 1892,
Mv Dear Moorabinba,—
I can’t say that I approve of the florin-to-look-on-from-
the-gallery idea which has obtained at Sydney charity
hops ever since they did it at the. Fresh Air League ball.
It has too many drawbacks. For instance, it enables
jealous wives who want to be sure hubby is really out on
business to sink a couple of shillings and see Henry float-
ing round with an angel in shoulder-straps, perhaps, and
wait up for him afterwards. Or vice-versa.
I don’t see, either, what precautions are taken to keep
the florins from mingling with the twelve-and-sixpences.
" hen the ball’s a-rolling a woman can easily slip off her
wraps and wander in an unconscious manner into the gay
and festive whirl. For, if you are decollete, there is
nobody to hinder you moving from balcony to ballroom-
people go unquestioned from the floor to the gallery, and
it’s a poor rule that won’t work both ways.
The musical “at home” at Government House, the
other Tuesday, was a success from every point of view.
Black and red preponderated, but Lady Jersey wore cream
brocade and diamonds, and her eldest daughter (a promis-
ing musician, by the way) looked well in pale blue. White
had a good following-one of the prettiest white gowns
was a white tulle over satin with garniture of lilies of the
valley.
Mr. A. W. Nathan scored the vocal success of the even"
ing with his rippling second song, and Poussard and
Madame Kellermann were in tip-top form. Also, Mr.
Gordon Burnside was in evidence with half a bed of
violets in his button-hole, and everybody wondered why
Mrs. Vanderveer Greene didn’t warble. Miss Guli Hack
was best in Bishop’s "Should Upbraid.” Miss Hack, by
the way, has returned to Adelaide, Lady Jerse3 - giving her
an artistic diamond brooch as a parting gift.
There was much joy among the performing guests at
Government House over the piano specially sent up for
the last “at home ’’—however wildly other musicians
might tear their hair about it being so “loaned.” The
piano in general use at the gubernatorial quarters is an
antiquated grand which has jangled for ever so many
decades. The legend goes that it was dumped on our
shores among Governor Phillip’s traps, and the aborigines
Used to run ten miles into the interior whenever anybody
played “God Save the King.”
An imported amateur pianist who plays those übiqui-
tous instruments with some kind of soul and much
diamond ring on his fingers wears rather too many
flounces for this end of creation. At a “ musical,” the
other evening, he was mildly requested to play a little
song for somebody but refused with much hauteur; “I
never accompany, thank you.” After all.it is only the
quick reader of music who cares to be faced with unknown
chords.
The brass-buttoned officers of the big mail-boats have a
complaint to make—a chromatic one. They say they’re
so tired of black frocks aboard. Not every second
voyageuse, but every one packs a black ball-dress and
a black evening-dress near the lid of her regulation trunk,
and the consequence is that the assemblage round the
saloon table generally looks as warm and cheerful as a
flutter of hungry crows. Why do women en route cling
so to black? Tho’ it makes the wearer look her smallest,
it doesn’t pack any tighter than red-and-yellow checks,
which would be far more welcome at sea than the doleful,
mourning hue. My advice to the girl who is going
“home” and wants to queen it from port to port, is for
her to leave out her bluest and pinkest gown for table
wear and watch her victims tumble down and worship on
the spot. If the officers’ complaint is well-founded, she
would be as lovely and unexpected as a rainbow in a
coal-hole.
Don’t you think we are far too stereotyped about (he
garments we make journeys in? A navy or black serge
with a set of loud-coloured shirts-a pair of buttercup
boots and a sailor hat-aren’t those what every woman
lays in directly her berth’s booked ! Mind you, the rig is
easy, sometimes excessively becoming, and admits of a
great deal of mild variety, and if one girl only appeared on
noard in it she would carry all before her. But when the
entire female passenger-list individually hoisls two tan
feet over the gangway and holds on a sailor hat surmount-
ing a serge garment and a coloured blouse—well, then I
Always feel inclined to take a pretty oath that if ever I
went on my travels I would board the ship in Turkish
trousers and a wreath of roses—just for the difference
of it.
Talking of dress on the raging ocean, reminds me of a
-lever trick a lady passenger managed, so as to sport a
new ball-dress at one of the hops on a mail-boat coming
this way. She had been wearing a pink dress with a
rrimson design all over it. which was lined throughout,
skirt and all (as the style now is), with soft-looking pink
jateen. So she wore that dress inside-out, putting a
lounce of black lace (off another dress) round the hem,
And hiding the bodice-seams with black ribbon, stitched
3n flat, and some cleverly-manipulated gauze. Her frock
was tho wonder of the evening—as it deserved to be.
So much junketing on the part of the Jerseys reminds
me of what I am told happened to a more Northern
ootentate on a recent run round a very raw-hide portion
of his dominions. The Governor was sitting alone on the
notel verandah one evening, when a local celebrity hap-
pened along, and took a scat beside the vice-king, whom
he failed to recognise in the darkness. “Dashed fuss
they’re makin’ over the Governor,” he began, sociably,
searching for his tobacco. “My good man,” replied the
potentate, loftily, yet with a gracious tolerance of the
barbarian’s ignorance, “/ am the Governor!” But the
local identity only turned his quid and said, in an
aggrieved voice, “ Well, they are making an (expletive)
fuss about cher, ain’t they?” Then his Excellency went
inside.
The largely-attended ball in aid of that most excellently-
attended charity—the Tempi Refuse—held in the Cen-
tennial Hall the ether Thursday, was radiantly V.R.—
their itinerant “excellencies” having 1 secluded seats in a
new sort of dais, like an upended packing-ease, and the
consequence was that inquisitive people peered cautiously
round the sides as if the J. family were caged, and liable
to snap if a whole head presented itself. The hall looked
very cosy—l think the drawing-room corners a great im-
provement on the rows of rigid cane furniture —and I was
glad to see the various rendezvous clearly marked —they
make things very easy for the dancing man. At one or
two public hops recently they left out this necessary
attention, with chaotic results. Floor and music were
good, and the supper was a pleasant hit of materialism —
barring a pronounced fad on the part of the caterer to
write “God bless our home,” and that sort of thing, in
pink sugar on his chef cVoeuvres.
In re the ball garments, to put it delicately, history
isn’t the only thing that repeats itself. Lady Jersey
came forth in a beautifully soft and creamy white satin
gown, trimmed with folds of gold spangled tulle—the
rather full skirt with straps of Indian embroidery on one
side; diamonds quivering, and a very poetic committee
posy of jonquils, snowdrops, violets, etc., tied with yellow
and brown ribbon ; Mrs. (Mayoress) Manning wore helio-
trope brocade and chiffon; Miss Manning was in primrose
silk ; Mrs. W. H. Brennan (one of the hon. secs.) sported a
very charming toilette of wisteria brocade and silver galon,
trimmed with edgings of fluffed silk ; Miss Windeyer (her
co-adjutant) was in peach colour ; Miss M'Carthy’s festive
array was mainly silver and white brocade warmed with
pink chiffon. Let me pause for breath.
Mrs. Burdekin wore pale saffron men , diamond orna-
ments; Miss Burdekin, cream duchesse picked out with
gold galon. 1 liked Mrs. Mailler Kendall’s peach-pink
silk with long-sleeved Eton jacket of grey velvet, trimmed
with silver gimp. Myra Kemble swished an ivory-brocade
train fully' two yards long, and her bouquet and her
diamonds were radiant things. Miss Madge Corcoran, in
pink satin brocaded with pink rosebuds and carrying a
shower posy, caught my admiring eye, though I can’t
say all the women did—especially in the fancy dress
direction. There was a “masherette ” in astonishingly
short skirts, but she had good reason for her tucks, and
I’m sure if she didn’t object the audience didn’t either.
Quite another thing, in the exasperating way, was a
middle-aged Red Riding Hood in a halo of untrammelled
back hair.
The launching of the “Lady Mary”—the inaugural
steamer of Balmain New Ferry Co., which means to
reduce the fare to Balmain to one penny—took place from
the builder’s (Mr. Walter Reeks, of North Sydney) yard on
30th ult., in the presence of Lord and Lady Jersey, Lady
Mary Yilliers, and a huge crowd of interested persons
filling four steamers. The ceremonies were as usual. A
bottle of fizz hung from the stern by red, white, and blue
ribbons, and was held by the Governor’s daughter, who
broke it against the side as the noble vessel glided into
the water. At least, that was what was intended, but
as a matter of fact Lady Mary’s first attempt at a christen-
ing was a failure, and it was the second try broke the
bottle—also, the noble vessel glided all right until she got
to the water, but stuck with one shoulder in the air at
the edge sulkily.
The launch was not a full-dress occasion. Lady Jersey
wore a plainly-made dark-green gown with a red and
yellow fleck, folded vest of scarlet silk, black hat trimmed
with wings and bows ; Lady Mary wore a simple tan frock
and was presented by the builder of the ship with a gold
bangle as a souvenir ; and Lord Jersey had gone back to
his blue tie again.
Afterwards a luncheon took place at Chowder, whither
Lord and Lady Jersey and suite, the directors, a sprink-
ling of members of the press, journeyed on the Govern-
ment launch. The tables looked very well, and the
garniture of wild flowers was patriotic but not pretty.
At public banquets and things where the slain fat
turkey lies with his toes in the air and people begin to
feel truly thankful, whenever the Governor is there the
proceedings always begin with grace. It’s not a bit
necessary, for the diner-out who is well-placed in the van
of the victuals as it were, feels so warmly grateful that
verbal expression is superfluous; but when the Governor’s
there somebody has to stand up and be thankful out loud
for the company, or else the proceedings would be a
menace to England’s greatness. Isn’t it interesting?
The “ Dr. Bill ” performance was given in Centennial
Hall on 30th ult. by Myra Kemble and her Co. in the
interests of the destitute women and children of Sydney,
and in the presence of a huge and radiant audience. I
can’t say- “ Dr. Bill ” itself was a success from all parts of
the house—half the time you could hear nothing of it in
the gallery. But at a charity performance the audience
interests me more than the show, and the big hall with
the bright stage across one end in a halo of palms and
lilies and the immense attendance, made a very interest-
ing spectacle.
When the curtain rose the Eastern gallery displayed the
most top-sparkle, but after a vain attempt to hear (or
perhaps after a vain attempt to he seen by the vice-regal
party, who were below) most of those there located swept
downstairs to the body of the hall. It was a full-dress
shivoo, and all the patrons were present in person, and
not only on the bill, as often happens. Lord and Lady
Jersey had seats in the front—Lady J. wearing a pale-!
pink gown, peppered with carnation ; Mrs. Willie Mitchell
displayed her usual correct taste in a gown of soft grey :
shades; Lady limes, in black lace, presented a half-
mourning effect through wearing a dark gown, trimmed
with violcts ; Mrs. Burdekin also wore black ; so did Miss
Flonic Hill ; Mrs. W. P. Manning had a white opera-
cloak, designed in pink roses; Miss Darley was a relief in
white and Oxford blue; Miss 31. Windeyer wore ivory 1
men— and, doubtless, many other people wore many
other things, only I didn’t happen to see them. Thanks
to the unflagging exertions of Myra Kemble, who was the
moving spirit, the ben. led to a nett total of over £3oo—
I don’t think it would, as a rule, pay to have charity .
plays in the Centennial Hall. It isn’t really possible to \
hear.
The last dog and fowl-show came off in Darlinghurst-
Hall last week. You have no idea what a subdued
radiance the presence of Lady J. can lend to a red-eyed
bull-pup, eating dog-biscuit for a wager, and even the
poodles look distingay w hen they are V.R. One serious
objection I have to dog-shows is that the avenues between
the stalls are not half wide enough. To add to the terrors
of the situation, the care-takers, I am told, polish up their
dogs’ cruel teeth with brushes during shows.
The safer side of the show was where the fowls were.
Some of the canaries were astonishingly yellow'-the
result, a bird-fancier told me, of feeding the little war-
blers with cayenne pepper, but I had my doubts of its
being a merely dietary effect—for don’t you remember
the time when a well-known Sydney sporting man was
fired out of a canary contest because he had endeavoured
to work up the winning shade by dipping Dickey in an
orange dye? Dog-and bird shows are encouraging places
for the pessimist, by-the-by, because liny illusu.iu- ih
dismal theory of the darker side being uppermost. At
this show the dogs yapped and snarled all the time, but I
never heard one little canary-bird get through a cadenza.
“ loianthe,” at. Her Majesty’s, sported a good circle om
hank-holiday, but I was particularly interested in a hot <
parly, where a lady applauded violently on a level witl.ii
her nose, and as her arms were like gas-pipes I kept
wondering why she did it. Most of the women had their
hair parted in the centre —the foolish fashion gains
ground, alas. Partings are very treacherous. They show
when the hair is thin, and they do spread so if the victim
is anyway beyond her beaute du diable.
When you forgot a very fat, Johnny Lucas sort of fay in
rose and pink, and a hoarse fairy in blue who talked
through her nose, there was really nothing but prettiness
in “ lolanthe.” Graupner’s Phyllis was a dainty Watteau
shepherdess in cream brocade flowered in blue and pink,
blue and pink ribbons floating; and Violet Yarlsy, in
white and the name-part, was a very soothing vision, but
she really shouldn’t say “My boy-hoy ” in the pathetic
solo of the last act if she wants my unreserved blessing on
her curly head. Mister Ryley (he had to sweep off the
stage with a broom the bouquets that fell to him on the
second last night of the “Gondoliers”) behaved like a
Strephon who had swallowed a spring, and his ribbons
shook in the breeze. By the way, Mr. R. doesn’t seem
half so worshipful when he has bows and ends dotted
about his person and a nosegay in his hat. It is not given
to every man to look beautiful with a flower in his hat, I
suppose.
Talking about theatres reminds me that at the con-
clusion of “Dr. Bill,” in the Centennial Hall, on Saturday,
Lord and Lady Jersey went behind the scenes to per-
sonally congratulate Miss Kemble on the success of the
affair. Lady Jersey also sent the adorable Myra some
flowers tied with the vice-regal colours, old gold and dark
blue.
There are grades in everything, and though I don’t like
the free-and-easy style of some Potts Point women who
make delivery-carts of their carriages—I met one the
other day rolling home with her new dress in its card-
board box on the front seat of her landau !—still there
are some harmless little packets that might go under the
seat.
Shopkeepers sometimes rise in mutiny against the
fashionable woman who has the cart sent six miles up-hill
with a packet of pins, and the other day when a Sydney
society lady drove up a carriage and pair to a big
emporium, bought four egg-cups at a penny each and
ordered them, of course, to be “sent,” the tired employe
rose and perpetrated a joke. He packed those egg-cups
in a crockery-crate, filled it with straw, embedded them
in the very middle, and sent the imposing package off.
The jest got home, seemingly, for next day the lady
called and filled the crockery-department with indignation
for quite ten minutes.

not ashamed. Up to date the popularity 0 f

than diminished, and the music sounds as BWeet

Miss Elsie Cameron, as the fairy autocrat
wears a fierce eye and a man-eating expression
which befits her situation, and her performance
takes well and gives pleasure to all, which is our
own and Alfred Bennett’s copyright observation
and persons found using the same will be prose-
cuted. Violet Varley and Flora Granpner
in the parts of lolanthe and Phyllis, run
a dead heat, and the gallery would gladly bn
a Mormon and take them both. Also Messrs
Vernon and Ryley, being up to their usual excel-
lence, can safely be taken as read; and Thu
Bulletin’s just severity has evidently produced a
good effect on Mr. Sydney Deane, who rises to
unexpected brilliance as the Earl of Mount
Ararat, and does that nobleman in excellent style
all through. Therefore this paper hereby lifts its
curse off Mr. Deane, and takes back the” brick of
condemnation that it threw at him, and he is now
at liberty to view us as a brother without any
extra charge. Mr. Bracy’s voice is as good as
ever, but he doesn’t seem altogether happy in the
part of Earl Tolloller, and looks at times as if lie had
eaten that nobleman in a raw state, and found
him indigestible and cold on the chest. “Charity
Begins at Home,” an airy, humorous trifle by
Collier, which is supported chiefly by George
Lauri as a wondrous fat boy, serves as an after-
piece. The most remarkable feature in it is that
Mr. Rosevear, in his capacity as an inspector of
something or other, threatens to personally slap
Miss Cameron, and when the curtain fell we went
away pondering upon what would have happened
to him if he had carried the threat into execution.
Our private opinion is that he would have
wakened up six weeks later in the hospital and
found his scalp lying beside him on a plate,

“Kindred Souls,” a tearing comedy, or
farce, or extravaganza, or burlesque, or something
in three acts, was put up at Sydney Opera House
on Saturday night, amid general applause.
“ Kindred Souls ” is not a work that is up to the
highest standard of art, and the cold, basilisk
critic could find much in it to complain of ; but it
is mirthful all through, and that is the principal
consideration. The cause of it is a loud-mouthed
naval person, who comes home unexpectedly, and
finds his wife entertaining four males, and
straightway that naval individual yells at the top
of his voice, and continues to yell till his vocal
chords give out. One of the crowd is a
respectable dentist, who has called in a desperate
effort to borrow <£loo to pay off a bailiff, who
has a lien on his tooth-blasting apparatus;
another is the landlord,_ who has dropped in
with a perfectly harmless intent ; the third is a
spiritualist who calls up the ghost of the lady's
grandmother when she wants counsel; the fourth
is keeping his eye on the spiritualist; and the
whole lot could explain things there and then to
the satisfaction of everybody, only the fearful yell
and inrush of the naval gentleman makes them
run for their lives instead. After that the show
differs from “Pink Dominoes” chiefly by reason
of the superhuman agility of the kindred souls
who are in the air most of the time for an hour and
a half, whereby the second act combines all the
advantages of a parachute descent, an explosion in
a dynamite factory, a flying machine, a landslide,
and the fall of Lucifer from Paradise. And when
John Gourlay, as the dentist, escapes for jus life
on to the top of the house, and then slips on
the chimney-top on to the roof, and sink 3
down with his finger nails full of tiles, and fall B
over the gutter, dragging the broken water-pipe
along with him, and rushes down on to the con-
servatory, and finally comes head first through
the glass on to the stage with a shriek in his
mouth and ten broken flower-pots in each han ,
the pit actually encored the performance. It even
seemed dissatisfied because Mr. Gourlay didn t g
up on the roof and fall off three or four times
more, and the look of gratitude on the comedian
face, while he picked the glass out of his cqnsti •
tion with one band, and tried to express l" s * ee
ings with the other, was worth seeing.

The performance of “Dr. Bill,” at Sydney
p ntennial Hall, for the .benefit of the destitute
omen and children of Sydney came off on Satur-
V v night with much success, financial and otlier-
pe. The proceeds amounted to a trifle over
'Lqq an d the comedy was a joyful thing for the
■ dividuals in the front seats. For those at the
10 ar it was a frost, for the Centennial Hall is a
Sabbath day’s journey from one end to the other,
id only the most stentorian of actors can bo dis-
tinctly heard at the further extremity. There-
fore the audience gradually swarmed to the front.
4s for the comedy itself, it was as gorgeous as of
1H and the kangaroo-dance has lost none of its
Pristine glory, and the misdeeds of Dr. William
Brown, who went astray after strange female
ntients with complicated nervous complaints,
|‘ ve lost none of their variety. After Ada Lee,
who judiciously toned down her high-kick toY.R.
nitch, Miss Myra Kemble was the principal
’lory’ of the entertainment ; and George Forbes,
whose bright smile and genial eye-glass have been
so long missing from the stage, re-appeared as a
nerson by the name of Webster. Miss Maggie
Kiiighfi ” another old favourite, assumed the
character of Mrs. Brown ; and Harry Leston, still
remembered as the surprising funny man of
Dampier's old combination, Owen Harris, and
Kdwin Kelly were the other leading features of
the struggle.

The “Spanish Students” opened for a
much too brief and fleeting season at Sydney
Garrick last Monday, under the command of
Senor Lopez. They are a talented and well-
trained combination under the leadership of an
able conductor, and unless that vague and hazy
thing known as the “ music-loving public ” is
altogether a myth, they will be well supported
during their stay. There are many quaint and
curious instruments among them —mandolines,
zithers, guitars, and the like, which are seldom
met with in real life, and which turn up chiefly
in ancient romances where some poetic, im-
passioned youth serenades his best demoiselle
amid the oleanders and the orange-groves.
The -“Students” perpetrate some strangely
original melodies on these unaccountable tools,
and wreak weird and wild combinations of long-
drawn sweetness such as the present writer never
expected to hear anywhere outside Paradise, and
when all the psalmists of the company burst forth
in some soul-stirring concussion of sound it
suggests the collision of the heavenly choirs in
the regions of space. All this arouses the
enthusiasm of the audience to a high pitch ; but it
is rough on the profoundly learned critics of the
daily press, for there are things in this entertain-
ment which they can’t locate even in the musical
dictionary, and great is the confusion that ensues,
** * *
“ Dorothy ” is the next item on the pro-
gramme at Sydney Majesty’s, and will take the
place of “ lolanthe ”on Saturday (August G). On
the same night “Jane,” with Myra Kemble as
the principal attraction, will be put on the stage
at the Opera House. A matinee benefit to Fred.
Hiscooks is to come off at the Garrick on Tuesday
next. Sydney Liedertafel will give a grand
musical festival at the Centennial Hall to-night
(Saturday) tor the benefit of the destitute women
and children of Sydney, who are many, Governor
Jersey and many other notabilities lending a hand.
Otherwise there are no changes in prospect, except
changes for the worse.

The Gaiety Burlesque Co. returned to Mel-
bourne Opera House on Saturday, when the people
came in thousands and fought for standing-room
to worship the golden calf which George Mus-
grove, their king, had setup. “Carmen Up to
Data” was received in a generous spirit of
approval throughout, and appeared to catch on
much the same as Dibbs in London. It is a point
in favour of this third outbreak of lunacy that it
ends rather suddenly on the right side of eleven
o’clock. There is not too much of “Carmen Up
to Data,” which, moreover, is a burlesque that
lets the intellect down gently and offers the funny
men of the show several opportunities to raise a
reasonable laugh. The lack of humorous girls is
more felt than ever, for the reason that lively
Alice Leamar, who represents all that is really
bright and brainy in the female department, is
specially remarkable for not being made enough
use of. Why Alice should be relegated to ob-
scurity between her “ turns ” and merely brought
out as an occasional blessing is a difficult question
to answer—but no matter. Lonnen supplies
a large portion of the business, as usual.
“L the course of the evening he sings
The Bogie Man,” supported by an effective back-
ground and chorus. Also lie is responsible for
another Irish ditty of the “ blood-and-hair ”
school, to the delight of everybody who isn’t tired

■ re wor th, with the exception of Maria Jones, who
’ w °>dh a little more than she goes for. The
general appearance of “ Carmen up to Data ” does
inch credit to George Gordon and the manage-
ent, and although the present season will be
j® lt; will be -about as sweet as the sugar of a
depraved public can make it.

(Mi air of desolation crept into the
rincescj’s last week. “Faust,” in fact, was such
m! , ()nouuce d failure that Satan declined to get
tra mafter t * ie s ' n| ght, and on Saturday
■*e bill was changed to “In the Ranks.” Under
circumstances the drama in question is a sad
event to transpire in cold weather, but when pro-
duced at a theatre where woe seems out of place
and a strong all-round company is absolutely
essential to success it is sadder than words can
tell. The closing of the Royal may benefit George
Rignold’s to some extent, yet not sufficiently to
keep “In the Ranks ” on its disconsolate legs for
a fortnight. Probably “ The Lights o’ London,”
or something else in which the tank can supply a
long-felt want, will be brought to the rescue on
Saturday night.
** * *
At the Bijou they intend to trot out “The
Grey Mare,” a farcical comedy by Sims and Cecil
Raleigh, on Saturday. “The Times” has ap-
pealed to the intellect of Melbourne for three
weeks, but the supply of intellect is pretty soon
exhausted, and so 13. and B, are withdrawing
Pinero’s biting play in favour of “The Grey
Mare,” which doesn’t bite or lash everybody with
its tale.

Bland Holt’s tenancy of Melbourne Royal
was concluded on Monday in strict accordance
with previous announcements. That monarch of
melodrama has packed up several tons of scenery
and taken his excellent company on tour, leaving
an empty theatre and an honourable record behind
him. “ Alone in London,” which played him off
the premises to a satisfactory tune, proved the
most complete artistic success of a long line of big

Something is still taking place atMelbourne
Alexandra, also the various halls arc as usual, and
the Circus is careering madly round the suburbs
with considerable success. These times, too, there
is a good deal of notable music to be heard in
the Town Hall. The last of a series of three
Symphonic Concerts, conducted on the co-opera-
tive principle by the great Napoleon, will be given
on Saturday afternoon, but if the public make it
worth the while of sixty first-class instrumentalists
to repeat their offence, they will probably start a
fresh series. The Ovide Musin Concert Co. appears
again this (Thursday) and Saturday evenings.
Musin drove an appreciative audience crazy at his
first attempt (last Saturday) and his genius for
fiddling is quite beyond question. He can thrill
the very soul on one string, and produce a whole
band of music with two turns of the wrist. His
low tones are as rich as a Lord Mayor’s dinner,
and his top scrapes are like an angel singing from
a balloon, and he himself is the most unaffected
and modest mannered violinist that ever caused a
house to rise at him. Edward Scharf, the pianist,
is another delightful feature of a concert that is
not too lofty for everybody to appreciate.

Dear Bulletin,— Have you heard this yarn of Frank
Lincoln? He shared a room in an hotel at Hey wood
(Vic.) with a stock-and-station agent, a complete stranger,
who travelled with him. As Lincoln pulled his shirt over
his head that night a terrific ripping was heard, and the
stranger gazed aghast, but when Frank jumped into bed,
sat up with his chin on his knees, complained that his
toe-nails were “ keen,” and then gradually straightened
out his legs to the accompaniment of rip, rip, tear-r r
from top to bottom of the sheet the green Tin simply
gasped out—well, &c., &c.— Young ’Un.
Monty Browne, the erstwhi'e advance-agent, relates
that during the Emelie Melville season, in Brisbane, years
ago, a local clergyman, anxious to see the operas, but
afraid of his little failing reaching the cars of his Bishop,
appealed to Monty to assist him. Monty used to meet the
gay parson up a side lane, take him through the private
staircase and stow him in a private box, where he viewed
the performance with evident enjoyment. During the
intervals a select party indulged in hrandies-and-soda
at the parson’s expense.

“The Drama and Music in N.S. Wales,” is a blue-
covered—yes, we will call it brochure—ot 95 pages, com-
piled by the veteran F. O. Brewer (for fifty or sixty years
of the S.M. Herald staff), printed by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Printer, and “published by authority of N.S.W.
Commissioners for the World’s Columbian Exposition,
Chicago, 1893.” Mr. Brewer portions out the space
impartially, giving the drama no more show than music,
and thus evading any responsibility of setting leg artists
and voice culturists by the ears. His matter is inter-
esting, if at times somewhat loosely spacious, and in his
preface he soft-sawders Yankeeland as having largely
assisted to develope the twin arts in Australia. That
solitary point seems to be the sole excuse offered for the
pamphlet as an official publication. It is to be regretted
that the authorities have not become seized of the neces-
sity of also publishing an official history of the “ Birth
and Development of Slugging in N.5.W.,” with an
authentic “Almanac of the Ratpit,” and a dissertation
on the “Progress of Gamecocks.” We might also sug-
gest a State-printed, officially-fathered pamphlet on “The
Influence of the English and German Concertinas on the
N.S.W. Bushman.”
Sydney City Organist Wiegand left Adelaide, after all

The fetching of Coquelin and troupe to Australia has
been talked over. The cost would be about two-thirds
that of Bernhardt and party, and the question would be
whether to stage Sardou’s spectacular “ Thermidor,” with
its big crowd, or the repertoire of comedies not requiring
so many people. Anyhow, it is pretty certain Coquelin
will visit Australia, after an American tour with “Ther-

greasy looking that they were kids, not children) gazed
round a certain Australian theatre on the second night of
“Norma” last Xmas. The stage-manager was posted in
the right wing, and the frantic gestures he made in order
to attract the notice of the kids, and make them compose
themselves, and refrain from scratching their itchy heads
and bodies, were visible to all on my side of the house.

them to give us the duo again. The youngsters were as
funny as a dog in church. — Young ’Un.

Twenty-two thousand pounds is the profit made
on tile output of last half-year by Tarrawingee Flux Co.
What a magnificent thing for the shareholders—we mean
those who secured interests as promoters ! By the way,
what did the promoters pay for their interests? The
right to run a tramway and to work the quarry was
secured from Parliament, presumably for nothing ; then
this right is divided for a tremendous, free interest
without liability. The chief promoter was a director
and big shareholder of the Proprietary, who retired
from the board just before the Tarrawingee scheme was
worked. The chief customer is the Proprietary mine
which is pledged to use the flux.

Probably the most successful mining Co. in the
whole world is that known as the Mining Financial In-
vestment Co. cf London, in existence a quarter of a
century. The Co.’s object is to purchase fairly well
opened-up mines, and by means of enlarged machinery to
economise management and increase the output. Their
operations have been chiefly confined to gold and silver
raising in America where they have been hugely success-
ful. A responsible representative and member of the
Co.—with unlimited capital at bis disposal—has been in
Australia during the last six months unobtrusively look-
ing for mines without so far finding any worthy of the
company’s financial notice ; the way he goes about his
business is a caution to cats -wild cats. It is quite pos-
sible, however, that he will yet find one or two mines
worth buying.
* * #
We have been asked to be a little more definite
in our suggestion that the slag of Broken Hill should take
the place of timber in the mines. The matter has never
been put by us exactly in that way. Large quantities of
timber would be required under any circumstances, but
not one-tenth of the quantity at present used if the levels
and passes only were timbered" and the stopes solidly
filled in with mullock or slag. Big lodes have been
worked in other parts of Australia, notably at Bendigo,
where we have seen tens of thousands of tons of tailings—
the equivalent of slag—automatically run into the old
stopes, making them astound as a bell. We admit that
this is being partially carried out now on the Barrier, but
the fault is that it was not done at first. Australia has
outlived its worship of the open, square-set timbering,
and has now to pay the penalty. It was always more
costly than the other and never as safe.

Early next month White Hock must go to work
again or run the risk of being declared forfeited for non-
compliance with labour conditions. The mine of a mil-
lion! so praisedbyone set of experts that compared to their
reports, Mr. Howell’s was considered condemnatory. Yet,
in explanation, Howell said at a meeting of shareholder's :
“ Many people seem (o think that this report condemns
the mine, but that is not so. It is a good mine ; if the
mine is properly worked and managed it ought to pay at
least £60,000 a year profit w ith the machinery I recom-
mend.”
# # »
When the public eye is taken off the strike it
will be directed to a far more serious state of things, viz.,
the downfall of the Broken Hill mine. Now the shares
have fallen from £l4 to £3 10s., the truth, so long con-
cealed, is revealed in its naked hideousuess. When the
shares were high, every statement made in reference to
the mine that did not exaggerate its value was met by a
denial. How often has the heading been used “ The mine
never looked better?”—how many paragraphs dwelling
upon the unlimited extent of the rich ore-body ? how'
many assurances that the managers and directors could
orily account for the depreciation of values by the
operation of bears and tightness of money, &c.—and
these, too, when the shares were nearly three times
their present price? In publishing extracts of the
last reports the newspapers gave Mr. Howell’s warn-
ing conclusion in ids general report, apd missed
a more important statement in his special report in
reference to the purchase of the British smelters. In
that, dated 14th May, he says: “ I think, however, that
it may he safely stated that, from one end of the mine to
the oiher, there is in the neighbourhood two millions of
tons of smelting ore, a great deal of which, how ever, will
•nly give a small profit, and at the present prices for lead
and silver, but a very small one ; nevertheless, it will be
worked just as long as it will show a profit.” The italics
are ours, but, after that, we see another downfall looming
ahead. Is it not very remarkable that a measurement
could not be made at the last half-year, seeing that less
than 200,000 tons of ore has been raised in the meantime ?

Placed at the end of an ordinary stamp, it would
be found at many mines more economical than concen-
trators. The isolation of N.S.W. gold mines very often
prohibits concentration because of the expense incurred
in sending ore to the nearest railway and thence tc
pyrites works for expensive treatment.' Where the gold
is fine and free from pyrites, we know of no better or
more economical method of securing it. If they were
turned out at £l5O each they would be more extensbely
used.

These two items must be carefully read ere their
full beauty becomes apparent. The first is a statement
made by the chairman at the Broken Hill Proprietary
Co.’s meeting in July, 1800; the second is the report for May,
1892; —(1) It has been pretty freely stated that we have
been “gutting” the mine, that is to say, that we have
been taking the best of the ore out and leaving that of
inferior quality. Now, we have the average percentage
of the ore taken from the different shafts in the mine, ns
follows (follows (lie quantity taken from the five shafts,
ranging from 15 to 22 per cent.). I have seen it stated
that we are taking the great bulk from M'Gregor’s
shaft; this statement conclusively shows that we are
doing nothing of the kind. Mr. Howell adds as a
sort of addendum to his report: There has been
no picking- or unusual selecting of ore whatever.
(2) With our present limited ore-reducing facilities we
shall he compelled to continue as we are doing, and draw
heavily upon our richest ores to enable us to pay our
current expenses and dividends. This system, which I
may say has been going on since the mine was first
opened, lias had the effect of leaving immense quantities
of ore standing in tho property sufficiently high in silver
to leave a good profit, but not good enough to pay ex-
penses and dividends under existing conditions.” Both
these statements can’t be true, and if the second one is
correct then the first looks very like a deliberate deception
practised upon the shareholders.

The great row between Harrison and
Blaine, which may have such momentous his-
torical results, arises out of a quarrel between
their wives, which originated in the drunken
freaks of Blaine’s youngest son—a youth well on
to 30 years of age—who, upon the occasion of a
ball, removed his shoes and endeavoured, vi ct
armis, to shove them down the low-cut corsage of
one of the belles of the evening. After this Mrs.
Harrison rigorously excluded Blaine, jun., from all
social movements under her control, and thus
was Mrs. Blaine moved to bitterest resentment
and determined enmity.
Earl Sherbrooke, Disraeli’s “inspired
school-boy,” better known as Bobert Lowe, died on
27th July, aged 81 years. He came out to N.S.
Wales as a barrister in ’42, was a nominee member
of the Legislative Council in ’43, afterwards repre-
sented Sydney in the popular chamber, returned
to England in ’5l, became a member of the
Commons, representing Kidderminster, Colne
and London University consecutively, made
a brilliant renegade of himself in opposition
to the extension of the franchise, rejoined Glad-
stone immediately afterwards and beca.ne the
G.O.M.’s Chancellor of the Exchequer in ’GB, was
later Home Secretary for a few months, and in ’BO
retired to the obscurity of the Peers, where he
attitudinised lately as anti-Home Ruler. He was
a brilliant barrister, and defended the notorious
convict Knatchbull, the murderer of Mrs.
Jamieson, in N.S.W.
The Broadhurst affair in 1845 culminated
in a special meeting of the members of the Aus-
tralian Club at which the propriety of expelling
Robert Lowe from the institution was hotly
debated. Broadhurst’s friends exactly equalled
in numbers Lowe’s friends and the chairman—
Riddell—gave his casting vote against the motion.
Patrick Boyle Coglin, known all over
S. A. as “ Paddy ” Coglin, one of the most eccen-
tric politicians ever elected to any legislature,
died the other day, aged 77 years. For 24 years—
from ’GO to ’84 —he was a feature, sui generis, in
the House. A little, shrivelled, monkey-faced
man, whose genial brogue made him popular, and
obtained for him a false fame for generosity, for
he was careful in expenditure, except where it
would advertise him, Paddy was a general
favourite. Ho affected the turf in his own S.E.
coast district, and affected spectacles and long
words in Parliament. He was very illiterate, but
the most rapid speaker the S.A. House possessed,
not even excepting the over-fluent, but always
connected, Ebenezer Ward, now M.L.C. The
jawbreakers that Paddy used to assimilate and
explode ! It mattered not that they had no rele-
vance to the context; they hadacrackling, ricochet-
ing sound, like an irregular, continuous fusillade,
and that was enough for Paddy. To see him
craning his thin neck and suddenly snapping up
his head when some other hon. member came out
with a polysyllabic word, was a treat; and his
muttered “That’s a good ’un—l must get that,”
could be heal’d all over the house. The Hansard
reporters (S.A. Hansard is done by contract with
a newspaper office generally) had strict and stand-
ing orders to “condense” severely all Coglin’s
speeches ; indeed, they couldn’t do anything else,
so a gallery “ turn ” with Coglin on his legs meant
a “fat ” rest. Paddy’s great grief, though it was
blended with a curious oratorical pride, was that
“the peripatetic literary scriveners” (Coglinese
for “reporters”) couldn’t write shorthand fast
enough to take down his speeches, and there is no
doubt that he nursed that sorrow as another in-
justice to Oireland right up to his death-bed. He
was interred in “the family vault of Patrick
Boyle Coglin, Esq.”

A thrilling horse-story is related in the
just published memoirs of the late Baron Marbot
an officer of the first Napoleon : ’
The Baron had, just before the battle of Eylau
fought, a thoroughbred mare, Lisette, which had* 8
ferocious trick of biting. His servant subdued her bv tv, a
singular device of offering her, when she flew at him
open-mouthed, a hot roast leg of mutton, which bun e
her severely. At Eylau the 14th of the line was cut off
from tiie main body, and remained on a small hillock
surrounded by the enemy, but which it would not cub
except by the Emperor’s orders. Resolved to try and
save this devoted remnant, he desired Augereau to send
an officer with orders to leave the hillock, and form into
a small square towards which a brigade should be sent
Two aides perished in the endeavour to execute this
order; then Marbot, mounted on Lisette, was sent
Leaving his sword in the scabbard, he set out at
racing speed through the Cossacks swarming on
the plain. He gained the intrepid square with
out a scratch, delivered his message, and was
implored by tiie major, who despaired of extricating hU
men, to convey the eagle to the Emperor. For conveni
ence he determined to break off the pole to which it was
attached, and while leaning forward in the saddle to get a
purchase to snap the stout stick, a cannon-ball went
through the hinder peak of his hat, the shock being the
more severe from the resistance of the leather chin-stran
He says, “ I seemed to be blotted out of existence but i
did not fall from my horse ; blood flowed from mv nose*
my ears, and even my eyes ; nevertheless, I still* ccm kl
hear and see, and I preserved all my intellectual faculties '
although my limbs were paralysed to such an extent
that I could not move a single finger." Meantime a
Russian column was mounting the hill, and a terrible
struggle was in progress all round him, but he coukl
not even press the mare with his knees to ur»P
her forward, although he was every moment exposed
to bayonet - thrusts, and a Russian officer with
hideous countenance kept making efforts to run him
through. “ Among the Frenchmen who had got their
backs against my mare’s near flank was a quartermaster
whom I knew. Having been attacked and wounded bv
several of the enemy, this man fell under Lisette’s bellv
and was seizing my leg to pull himself up, when a Russian
grenadier, too drunk to stand steady, wishing to finish
him by a thrust in the breast, lost his balance, and the
point of his bayonet went astray into my cloak,’which at
that moment was puffed out by the wind. Seeing that I
did not fall, the Russian left the sergeant and aimed a
great number of blows at me. These were at first fruit-
less, but one at last reached me, piercin«- mv
left arm, and I felt with a kind of horrible
pleasure my blood flowing hot. The Russian
grenadier with redoubled fury made another thrust at
me, but, stumbling with the force which he put into it
drove his bayonet into my mare’s thigh. Her ferocious
instincts being restored by the pain, she sprano- at the
Russian, and at one mouthful tore off his nose, lips eye-
brows, and all the skin of his face, making of him a living
death’s-head, dripping with blood. Then, hurling herself
with fury among the combatants, kicking and biting
Lisette upset everything that she met on her road. The
officer who had made so many attempts to strike me tried
to hold her by the bridle. She seized him by his belly, and
carrying him off with ease, she bore him out of the crush
to the foot of the hillock, where, having torn out his
entrails and mashed his body under her feet, she left him
dying on the snow.
Rescued from Misery.
JohnE. Aubrey, Esq., Sofala, N.S.W., kindly
furnishes the following testimony : —“ In January,
1879, I was master of a provisional school in the
western district, and I married a delicate young
lady, and was shortly afterwards appointed
teacher under the Board of Education. Our first
child was born in September 1880, after which my
wife never seemed to regain her usual strength.
In May, 1881, she was suddenly taken very ill;
the family doctor was sent for, and was greatly
puzzled ; he, however, prescribed and the patient
partly recovered. About twelve months later she
was very much troubled with a painful throbbing
movement in the abdomen, especially when lying
down, loss of appetite, and what food was taken
afforded no nourishment. Another doctor was
called in, who sounded and prescribed, but to no
purpose. We left the neighbourhood and went to
Lithgow Valley, hoping to effect an improvement,
but without result. Another doctor did all he
could, and decided that the case was one of
enlargement of the liver, and this proved to be
the case, as the side sometimes swelled so large as
to prevent dressing ; so matters progressed and
got from bad to worse. Numerous doctors con-
tinued to do but little good, and that only
temporary, but all agreed that the system was
generally weak, and wanted building up ; and the
liver would sometimes swell and burst iff button
after button off her ulster, while standing in a
store. For the last two years the trouble has been
complicated with a most distressing rushing noiso
in the head, so violent as to render it impossible
to lie in bed at night, with violent attacks of
windy colic, causing complete prostration, and
excoriation of the throat. Eventually, after
further suffering, I read of Clements Tonic and
its wonderful effects, and sent for a bottle. The
first dose was too strong for the debilitated
stomach. I diluted it with water and gradually
increased it as the stomach could bear it. Mrs.
Aubrey has now taken three bottles, and the
effect is most marvellous; the swelling has entirely
disappeared, and the waist is reduced by several
inches. The eyesight is renewed and strengthened,
the appetite returned, the noise in the head
diminished, and, to use my wife's own words.
‘Language utterly fails to describe the relief and
benefit she has experienced by the use of only
three bottles of Clements Tonic.’ I consider
Clements Tonic the most palatable and effective
medicine I have ever used in either England,
India, Africa, or Australia.

The great lesson of the English elections
has not been preached upon by the Australian
Tory press. Joseph Arch, a genuine ex-farm
labourer, defeated a lord of the Bentinck tribe by
3000 votes, and for a county division where the
Beutincks ranked as very little less than Jehovah
a quarter of a century ago. Men not yet grey can
remember the time when Arch’s candidature was
regarded as a howling radical joke.
One effect of a stiff progressive land-tax-
exclusive of improvements, and graded on capital
values only-would be the stimulation of building
competition on town holdings, with a consequent
fall in rents. By the State pocketing the un-
earned increment in this manner, country land-
owners would justly benefit, inasmuch as, under
present conditions, the pastoralist and agriculturist
support in undue proportions the onus of land
taxation.
Victorian militarism digs its heels in. The
Minister for Defence moves for leave to introduce
a Bill to amend the Defence and Discipline Act
with a view to crowding civilians out of all court-
martials, and constructing the court of military
officers only, with the exception of a judge-advo-
cate. The warriors are also anxious to increase
the penalty for breach of discipline from one to
five pounds. They will want the cat presently,
and then they'll want the earth.
The Queensland Estimates have been
postponed till September so as to allow “ the gag ”
Bill to pass in the meantime. Then the reduction
or repeal of payment of members can be tackled
and will probably bringdown with it the salaries
of Ministers and a 20 per cent, reduction in the
Civil Service list. A short session wdl probably
intervene between the dissolution and the general
elections, in which the Laud Grant Railways
Contracts will be rushed through, and then - the
liveliest general elections on record.
England’s Foreign-trade practices have
made her prosperity dependent on the whims of
foreign nations. To-day the relief of domestic
evils has to be left subservient to the question of
the Ministry’s power to hold its position abroad
and the importance of maintaining or extending
the highways of commerce. With this shocking
example before us, it is pleasurable to note that
Jingo Victorian Chirnside’s battery of artillery

tenantry.
The Victorian coal boom, assisted by free
railway construction by the State, looks very
much like another Parliamentary swindle. And,
by the way, James Service has just given tongue
to the sentiments of the outside world. In the
House, last week, that canny old Scot said he
bad heard of the coal measures of Victoria since
ever he landed here, and it was a history of mani-
festly determined efforts to make a haul out of
the public purse, professedly in the interests of
the country, but really to benefit the promoters of
tliese coal ventures.”

ance. The difficulty has been somehow got over,
in secret conclave.
The KS.W. Public Works Committee are
not a happy family. The bumptious style of
Chairman Garrard is most offensive all round ;
and each member is more cocksure on engineering
questions than Engineer-in-chief Dean. There
could not be more delay in business if a general
understanding existed to spin out the examination
of each witness into the ensuing session. The
same evidence is brought out in many forms
and great satisfaction appears to be felt whenever
a sitting has been absorbed by two witnesses. A
sitting’s fees amount to £4O !
Over 5000 women of Dunedin (M.L.) and
suburbs have signed a petition against the female
franchise on the ground that if they were
authorised to vote it would “destroy their self-
respect and lose them the respect, goodwill and
love of their husbands, sons, brothers and
fathers.” As they are already authorised to get
reasonably drunk and to swear moderately and to
chew tobacco, and yet don’t lose the respect of
their husbands, sons, brothers and fathers so long
as they do not make use of the authority, it strikes
us that the fathers and other male relatives of
Dunedin must be a curious crowd.
So pie bright particular fool cables out the
announcement that Messrs. M‘Ewan and Lysaght,
whoever they may be, “expressed the opinion that
tenders for the manufacture of steel rails for the
N.S.W. railways would not be accepted within
the colony, owing to the difficulty of procuring
labour at a rate that would enable the tenderers
to compete with the outside world.” Evidently
the dull, stereotyped Briton can’t get the idea of
free competition out of his head, and it never
occurs to him that the Protectionist Government
intends to supply work to the people of N.S.W .
only, and that the outside world hasn’t any more
to do with the matter than the cheap sweaters in
J upiter.
CHARLIE BURFORD.
Freetrade may lay claim to the grace of
being a Christian absurdity, romantic in theory
but lamentable in practice. When Freetrade is
smitten on one cheek by a Protectionist rival, it
turns to him the other also ; Protection adopts the
more robust and effective method of plugging the
striker back. When Freetrade is robbed of its
cloak, it offers to throw in its coat also. Protec-
tion handcuffs the robber. If the principles of
Freetrade were applied to nationhood, Great
Britain should disband her navies and let all
peoples scramble for her commerce. Freetrade,
in short, is a sentimental martyrdom ; Protection
is cold business.
Rub your eyes! The Foreign-trade S.M.
Herald, commenting upon the action of N.S.W.
Government “in inviting tenders for the supply of
175,000 tons of steel rails, to be manufactured in
the ’province, from local materials, and with local
fuel,’’ really did say ;
Within certain limits, the collateral advantages con-
nected with local manufacture could be set against the
excess of cost, so as to make the transaction justifiable in
the interest of the community generally.
That is all that the logical Protectionist ever con-
tended for. “ Within certain limits. ’ But,
whether those limits be narrow as the nostrils of a
greyhound, or broad as one of Parkes’ stories,
the admission made above lays the axe to the root
of the Freetrade creed.
Minister of Justice O’Connor (N.S.W.)
proposes, in his Bill for the Suppression of Larri-
kinism, to place the power of flogging in the
hands of one police-magistrate instead of two, as
at present! This is a monstrous move. There
are on the N.S.W. Stipendiary Bench a number
of level-headed and humane stipendiaries ; like-
wise several brutes, who have, it is plain from
many decisions they have given, and many
.opinions they have publicly uttered in Labour and
other cases, no more regard for the feelings of a
man in poor clothes than they have for the feelings
of a mad dog. And the lash is an instrument for
the benefit solely of the man in poor clothes—let
us say again that no little heap of broadcloth
duds was ever yet stacked, or ever will be stacked,
alongside a set of British or Australian triangles.
The Labour members should, one and all, perish
of exhaustion on the floor of Parliament, ere they
permit the enactment of so retrogressive a pro-
posal.
At latest advices British troops are moving
towards the Afghan frontier, and probably another
little war is in prospect, for the Lost Ten Tribes
are understood to bo assuming a disrespectful
attitude, and that vague and hazy tiling known as
“ steps ” will have to bo taken to make them love
and reverence the Imperial crown. There are
more British reputations and more British prestige
buried among the Afghan hills than in almost any
other patch of ground of the same size upon this
earth, and the Ten Tribes are a nightmare on the
chest of every Indian viceroy, and about every
ten years or so a new army gets lost among the
r'nwa on the road to Cabul, and then the Age
is s to point out that an Australian contingent
ihauld go to the rescue because Herat is the
“ key ” of this continent and ought to be defended
at any cost. The world is getting pretty sick of
the eternal Afghan scare by this time.

“Every Word True.”
SO SAYS THE WRITER OF THAT KASIOt'S LETTER.
( New York Tribune.)
It would be difficult to measure the interest and
comment, not to say excitement, which the
published letter of Dr. R. A. Gunn has occasioned.
The prominence of the doctor and the unusual
nature of the letter have both tended to add
interest to the subject and make it really the talk
of the town.
I called upon Dr. Gunn at his residence, No.
124 West Forty-seventh Street, yesterday after-
noon. I found the reception-room crowded, and
it was only after an hour’s waiting that I succeeded
in obtaining an interview.
Dr. Gunn is a distinguished-looking man, and
impressed me at once by his manly bearing and
air of sincerity. I took the seat he courteously
offered me, and said :
“ Are you aware, doctor, of the commotion your
letter has caused ?”
Dr. Gunn smiled, and replied—“Things out of
the ordinary usually cause comment. It is not a
common thing for physicians to endorse and
recommend‘medicines other than those in the
“Materia Medica.” History is full of instances
of scientists who have endorsed discoveries they
believe to be valuable, and have been denounced
for so doing, and yet these same discoveries are
blessing the world to-day. I hope I have the
manhood and courage to be true to my convictions,
and that is why I so openly and unhesitatingly
endorse Warner’s Safe Cure as being the greatest
of modern discoveries for the cure of diseases which
have baffled the highest skill of the medical pro-
fession.”
I was impressed with the earnestness of the
doctor, and saw that he meant every word that
he said.
“How long have you known of this remedy,
doctor ?” I asked.
“Nearly ten years,” he replied. “My attention
was originally called to the Safe Cure by a serious
case of Bright’s disease, which was considered
hopeless, and yet, much to my surprise, under its
use the patient recovered. I have tried it in other
cases since then constantly, and my original faith
in its power has been confirmed. I have seen
patients recover from inflammation of the bladder,
gravel, and Bright’s disease when all other treat-
ment had failed, and I have found it especially
efficient in all female troubles.”
“ Can you specify any particular case, doctor?”
I asked.
“That is a delicate thing to do,” the doctor
replied, “but, as I always keep a written record
of my cases, I can accommodate you.”
Thereupon the doctor opened his desk, and pro-
duced his record book. Turning over the leaves,
he said :
“ Here is a case of a gentleman who was a great
sufferer from inflammation of the bladder of long
standing. He had consulted a number of phy-
sicians without benefit. When fiist consulted, I
myself tried the usual methods of treatment, but
without success, and I finally advised him to try
Warner’s Safe Cure. Ho felt better from the
start, and in a few weeks was entirely cured.”
The doctor turned a few pages further, and
then said ;
“ Here is another case. It is that of a gentle-
man who had frequent attacks of renal calculi,
which, as you know, is gravel forming in the
kidney. He had never been able to prevent these
formations, but after an unusually severe attack I
recommended him to try the Safe Cure which he
did, and, although it is three years since he took
the remedy, he has never had an attack since.”
The doctor continued to turn the leaves of his
book, and suddenly exclaimed :
“ Here is a most remarkable case. It is that of
a lady who had suffered for some time from
Bright's disease. She became enceinte, and about
the" fourth month suddenly became blind, had
convulsions, and finally fell into a state of coma,
caused by uremic cr kidney poison. Several
physicians who saw her said she could not live,
and in this view 1 fully concurred. As she could
still swallow, I said, as a last resort, that they
might try Warner's Safe Cure. They did so, and,
to the surprise of everyone, she recovered. She
has since given birth to a living child, and is
perfectly well.”
“ Those are certainly most wonderful cases,
doctor,” I said, “and while I do not for a
moment question their authenticity, I should con-
sider it a great favour if you would give me their
names. I think the importance of the subject
would fully justify it.”
“ In the interest of other sufferers I think you
are correct,” Dr. Gunn finally observed, after a
moment's thought. “Both the lady and her
husband are so rejoiced, so grateful, over her
recovery that I know she is only too glad to have
others hear of it. The lady is Mrs. Fames, the
wife of the well-known costumier. She was not
only restored, but is in perfect health to-day.”
I thanked the doctor for his courteous reception,
for the valuable information imparted, and I feel
assured that his generous and humane nature will
prevent him from feeling other than glad at seeing
this interview published for the benefit of suffer-
ing humanity.

A picture of the pretty infant heiress,
Kathleen, rubbing cheeks with a little daughter
of Purves, Q.C., is on view at a Melbourne photo-

folding Purves himself to her heart, and saying,
“Oil am so glad that you tollared me from my

Even the auction sale of that fallen Aus-
tralian magnate’s furniture was a “ cronk ” affair.
Many van-loads of the deposed potentate’s stuff
had been removed weeks before the event, and
other van-loads from a local furniture warehouse
were brought up to fill the vacuum. This will
send a cold shudder through many ladies who
gave fancy prices for items of Blank & Co. s old
stock in the belief that they were getting souvenirs
of a once great and rich man.

Poor Mrs. Robertson, the widow whose
La Rose Estate was entrusted to the care of her
co-executor, the Honourable James Munro, is still
under the impression that she hasn't lost her all.
But that she will lose her all unless Jimmy’s
transaction be quietly annulled by the liquidators
of the Real Estate Bank (and this possibility has
been hinted at) is a solemn certainty. Munro, as
acting-executor of the late Robertson, put La
Rose up to auction, and John Woods bought it
for .£2B*ooo. Mrs. R. didn’t get that comfortable
sura of money, however. Trustee Munro kindly
placed it for her on deposit—in the Real Estate
Bank. Two days before that blessed bank left off
pretending to be solvent, and put the shutters up,
the innocent widow went to draw out some interest
on her deposit, but was informed—over the
counter, we believe —that she couldn’t do better
than leave it where it was. So Mrs. Robertson
left that bit of interest to go the same way as the
capital— i.e., bung. At present the unfortunate
lady appears to be ruined, and it is pathetic to
aear her expressing the vague belief that her bus-
land’s old friend “can’t have lost La Rose.”

At Hobart, recently, as recorded in The
Bulletin, a man was gaoled for one month for
stealing a handful of walnuts from Government
House grounds. In the same week it was
announced that a well-paid Government official
had been found “short in his cash,” but the
amount having been made good the Treasurer had
decided to take no steps in the rnatter further
than suspending the officer ! This, by the way,
makes the third shady “ suspension ” in connec-
tion with the Hobart G.P.O. within a very short
space of time.

When Governor Norman was at Croydon,
N.Q., recently, he stayed at Gus. Weinhart’s
hotel, and, on leaving, complimented Gus. on the
arrangements made. Gus., hat in hand, bowed
profoundly, and said ; “ I zank your lordship, and
shall consider your braise a nail in my coffin."
Being chaffed subsequently about the expression,
he replied, “Of gorse. I did mean itwas a fedder

The departure of a certain consul from an
Australasian port for a trip to his native land
recalls a like expedition of his some few years
back. Ere taking his wife for a flying visit to his
own fatherland, he obtained return-tickets allow-
ing them three months ashore. 'Shortly after
arrival the wife was taken ill and, after lingering
a while, died. The inconsolable husband, going
over his papers one day, came on the steamer
tickets, and was horrified to find that he had less
than a month left in which to re-embark. But,
holy Moses ! vat shall I do mit der oder ticket;
must I lose all dat geldt?” In three weeks he
w<is on 1 1 is way back to the Antipodes, talcing
with him Mrs. D. No. 2 on de oder ticket.

An Australian spectacle : A barrister
accepts a fee for defending, in a case of alleged
fraud, one of a number of prisoners whose secrets
are no doubt disclosed to him by their attorney.
Further on he accepts a fee for prosecuting one or
two of the same set of prisoners in connection
with the same matter. By-and-by he accepts a
commission as Judge to try several of the same set
of prisoners in the same matter. No man is more
than human. The impartiality required by him
who should do his duty under all these circum-
stances is an attribute of God alone.

The old story of the faithful dog once
more. A French hermit, Emery, lived near
Crudine Creek, Sofala (N.S.W.), his only com-
panions two faithful dogs, with which one evening
he locked himself in his cabin according to habit.
Never again was he seen alive by human eye. A
fortnight later a fellow-countryman named Bourget
looked in through the window of Emery’s hut and
saw his friend lying dead on the floor, while the
two faithful dogs—ay, what of the dogs ? Well,
they were eating what little remained of Mon-
sieur Emery. That is a typical end of all your
romance. In the end you are always eaten by
your dogs.

A Christian convention was held at

The boss of a big Sydney hardgoods
establishment has a horror of the turf and gamb-
ling, and has made it a rule of “the house” that
none of his confidential employes shall visit race-
courses. Boss (to the head of a special depart-
ment the other day) ; “Mr. X., were you on the
racecourse yesterday?” X.: “Yessir.” “Did
you bet, Mr. X. ?’’ “Yessir.” “Was anybody
from here with you?” “Yessir, Mr. Z.” At
this moment, Mr. Z., who is general manager of all
departments, enters. Boss: “Mr. Z., were you
at the races yesterday ? ” Z. (promptly and un-
blushingly) : “No. sir.” Boss ; “ Mr. Z., you are
dismissed. Mr. X., I'll give you another show.”
Moral : Always be truthful when there is a second
party “ in the know.”

It is noteworthy that when Cardinal
Moran is invited to dine with Gov. Jersey at
Government House, Sydney, Anglican Primate
Bishop Smith is not invited, and vice versa.
Which reminds us that in the old N.S. W. coaching

to meet and sleep under the same roof at Wascoe s

to boast that none of the crockery was ever

A small thing just brings to our memory
one of the worst typographical blunders made by
a Melbourne morning paper. An English reporter
THE RULING PASSION.
JONES (just recovering from buggy-accident): “Is-is the pony hurt?"
NURSE: “No!"
JONES : (with a sigh of relief): "That's good! Is the trap broken?”
NURSE: "Smashed to splinters!”
JONES: “Oh, Lor' ! That's bad! Is the wife hurt? ”
NURSE: "Died last night! "
JONES: " Ah, well! Things are not half so bad as they might have been, after all !” -(Quietly
goes to sleep.)
on the staff wrote a most glowing bit of the Mel-
bourne Cup introduction, managing to introduce a
reference to the “ wine-producing grapes,” but
what the type made of the “ wine ” we are afraid
to say. Oh, the oaths of that English^ reporter !
Balls were held at nearly all the townships
Governor Norman (Q.) struck in his overlanding
expedition. The female dancing population of
one of them numbered six—all servants, and
three of them employed at the Governor's
hotel. “ Haw ! ’ said his aide to the cook in the
opening dance, “ Youah face seems haw

The Tasmanian Government’s retrench-
ment-scheme includes the reduction of the salary
of the Governor to .£3500. What sort of sand-
wiches do they expect from a £7O-a-week Gover-
nor ? By the way, with the advent of Gladstone
to power Sir Robert Hamilton (who is said to
have drafted the G.O.M.’s famous Home Rule
Bill) should have a golden time ahead.

Why is the Melbourne Mercantile Bank
like the New Testament ? Because it begins with
Matthew and ends with Revelations.
While the motion for the closing of the
Parliamentary refreshment-room was being dis-
cussed in Queensland Assembly not long ago, a
visitor in the stranger’s gallery sent down a note
to a Labour-member, asking him to look at an
object outside in the corner of an adjoining apart-
ment. “Yes, yes,” said the Colonial Secretary,
to whom the note was afterwards handed. It is
a disgrace !” And it was.

reverentially place the required stimulant at your

The small editor of a Sydney weekly lately
met in a public-house the bloated proprietor of

propped himself up against the counter as if going
to camp there. The little one was in a hurry.
“ So’long,” said he, holding out his hand. The
big man clasped his over the place where our

Dear Bulletin,—You ask “ why does not
some pretty girl set up in Sydney as a barber? ”
Some six years ago there was a feminine barber in
Sydney. I used to shave then, and another fellow
(who didn’t) dared me to go in there and face the
music. It was not a success. She was not at all
pretty and her fingers were cold and clammy.
Moreover, she was bad-tempered. My companion
succeeded in making me smile when she said
sharply, “look here, young man, if you don’t
stop grinning you’ll get'cut.” A pretty girl with
warm fingers and a sweet temper might succeed ;
but a cross corpse, No. —Delcomyn.

yet there are many of them on the Block, and, at
least, half-a-dozen in Parliament —all, all in the
same or similar rank swindles. And their names
are becoming more and more public every day.
Two big crashes loom ahead —men who are “ souls
of integrity,” “leaders of the people,” “brilliant
statesmen.” “Influential names,” once ; “men
of effluvium ” now.

Lady Kintore recently gave little Chief
Justice Way a dog, which travels in its august
owner’s lap almost everywhere. The other day,
when the Chief had to meet a vice regality at the
railway station, his Associate carried the aristo-

a will case, which had been very long and very
tedious, and in the course of which the little Chief
had more than once hurt the feelings of a minion
of his court, that minion went outside and
deliberately kicked the precious doggy, whose
howls filled the corridor, caused its judicial pro-
prietor to fidget and whisper eager messages, and
almost brought about an adjournment of’ the

Theprosecution in Adelaide,
S.A., against the doctor of the
s.s. Oroya, for neglecting to
report the smallpox on board
that vessel, fell through on the
technical ground that acting-
health-officer Jagoe, not being a
medical man, had no power to
act. Dick Jagoe, nicknamed
from time immemorial “ the
Sandhill Savage,” is a piratical-
looking, huge-whiskered indivi-
dual, who bosses the pilots at
“the Semaphore,” Port Ad-el-
aide, and acts (or used to act,
in the writer’s Adelaide days)
as shipping-reporter to both the
Adelaide dailies. A hoarse-
throated, rough-languaged,
trouser-hitching, pilot-jacketed,
quidchewing, glazed-hatted, old
seadog, with a fancy for the
companionship of a spyglass. An
energetic mails - tenderer and
shipping reporter, and not with-
out claims to abilities in more
pretentious literature. A man
with bright-blue eyes who, in
his tender moments, woos the
erotic muse and babbles freely
of the sailor that loves a mer-
maid ; or inflames himself into
lyrical statistics as he tells how
the fearless mariner pursues the
devastating squid all through
its exuded tracks of blackness,
“at the bottom of the deep,
blue sea, oh my!” It seems a
sacrilege that .any littlewig or
bigwig of a lawyer should be
allowed to question the medical
status of Dick Jagoe.

The lumber of assignments and private com-
positions in N.S.W., is something appalling. The sale of
these insolvents’ stocks seriously prejudices the ordinary
trader, and recently in one fairly prosperous town the
three storekeepers “whitewashed” one after the other.
The amended bankruptcy law should compel the private

The present is an opportune time for the N.S.W.
Government to pass an act restricting dividends to ten
percent, in all companies soliciting public money. Only
about three big monetary institutions would be affected,
and a grace of, say, five years could he extended so as to
equalise the market value of the stock. Investors would
find that lessened dividends would be more than com-
pensated for by the additional security afforded by in-
creased cash reserves enhancing stock values and pro-
portionately reducing the risk felt by all shareholders.

A now celebrated Hebrew learnt his first
financial lessons in a little office with a big sign “bills
discounted.” This was prior to the “ bank ” boom. He
had not a tenner to his credit at the bank, hut no matter.
A small manufacturer, rather squeezed for the “fourth,”
obtained an interview respecting discount of some trade
bills. “Oh, certainly. I think so. Come to-morrow.”
Melchisedeoh then trotted off to a genuine finance co.,
submitted the name of Ids client, and arranged for
melting a couple of hundred. When the customer sub-
mitted his bills lie was told, “just as a mailer of form,”
to give his own bill for an equal amount as collateral
security, as it ids endorsement on the paper submitted
was not sufficient. Then Melchisedeoh cleared off and
discounted botii sets of paper, and was a bloated capitalist
with a real hank of Ids own ere he had to retire the
“ unearned increment.”

A finance co. sufficiently strong to take good
trade bills at 8 per cent. p.a., without re discount, would
do a remarkable and reliable business in Sydney. Banks
proper have no right to be pawnshops. In London the
paper of a big firm goes through special brokers, who cut
the prices very fine, and it is no unusual thing for any of
the St. Paul’s Churchyard warehouses to pass their bills
at lower interest rates than consols.

Cabled that a Philadelphia speculator has
murdered a local stock-broker, and then committed
suicid' 1 . There are in Australia now a largo number of
speculators who would have comparatively easy consci-

conspicuous rascals under the Southern (or any other)
“Cross,” are a well-tailored pair, now more or less
financially “ stiff,” who, not satisfied with the ordinary
fat commission of their trade, have consistently robbed
their clients by trading off upon them valueless shares of
their own, pretending that they were selling on account
of a third party.

The report of Mr. James Robertson, the
liquidators’ auditor, knocks the very last shred of respect-
ability out of the defunct Australian Banking Co., of
Sydney. According to Mr. llobertson’s report (and also
according to Tub Bulletin's expnsii, years ago) the bank
started by buying for £lO,OOO, in paid-up shares, a busi-
ness which was so utterly rotten that the vendor should
have rather paid £lO,OOO to get the noxious thing carted
away. The bank made a loss the first half-year of its
existence, and it made another loss every half-year it
lasted. It showed a large “net profit” and declared a
dividend at every meeting, but there never was any
profit, and not one dividend was honestly earned. The
“profit” was simply made up by charging 15 to 30 per
cent, interest on hopelessly bad debts, which was just as
honest a proceeding as charging 40 per cent, on the
moon ; and the concern was born rotten, and lived rotten,
and died the same way. But the most humorous feature
of all is embodied in the evidence given before a Parlia-
mentary committee, when the garish pawnshop wanted
and nearly obtained—authority to issue notes as an
aggravation of its other crimes. On this occasion one of the
witnesses—his name is not given, but the public can guess
his identity in less than three tries—assured the committee
of the solvency of the concern, because the accounts had
been specially audited by a city firm, and that
firm’s gratifying report bad made him feel quite content.
He seemed so cheerful over it that the committee didn’t
ask to see the report, but took it all for granted. That
same document is now published, and it consists prac-
tically (though a man whom you hire to audit your
accounts can’t well call you a rascal out loud to your face)
of a brief and blasting statement to the effect that the
balance-sheet was a lie, and the alleged “ securities ” a
swindle, and the whole bank a demoralised institution.
The Select Committee actually passed the Bill making
the Australian Banking Co. a note issuing- institution be-
cause of this blood-curdling paper, and but for Mr, Traill’s
interference, at a later stage, the measure would have
gone through on the strength of it!

Majah-General Somebody, speaking at a Mer-

false balance-sheets, inflated with a non-existent reserve
fund, had been presented to the unfortunate shareholders
tor some time past. Also, “ referring’ to the observations
which had been made as to Sir M. H. Davies, Sir Graham
.Berry, and Mr. Munro, he thought it a good lesson for the
. ! les khe-t they should know in what estimation we
(British investors) hold their public men.” After which
a Mi, Diake, director of a South African bank, exonerated
Graham Berry from blame in the balance-sheet matter,
but said he had no confidence in the intregritv of the
Melbourne liquidators. The cable-liar reported, a fort-
night later, that these well-informed people were
favourably considering ” the hanky-panky proposals of
Davies!

The report of the Commission of Enquiry
informs the sorrowing shareholders of the V.D.L. Bank

amount which the V.D.L. Bank had permission to over-
draw from its London agents, which permission expired
before the balance-sheet was actually issued ! A further
“asset ” of £5OOO was polished in a similar manner, and so
on. And what next ?

An agency has been opened at bd Elizabeth*
street, Sydney, for the sale of Count Caesar
Mattel’s remedies which are claimed to be a
sovereign cure in many cases of cancer, con-
sumption, heart-disease, and other complaints
commonly supposed to be incurable. These
remedies have been enthusiastically endorsed by
Mr. Stead in the Review of Reviews, who declares
that he has demonstrated their efficacy by personal
investigation. Also they have been denounced by
the great majority of the medical profession as mere
quackery and imposture, but as the medical pro-
fession always does denounce any remedy that
originates outside its own little circle this does
not necessarily prove anything. At all events the
profession is never likely to acknowledge itself in
error ; if Count Mattel’s remedies are a success it
will simply adopt them as its own, and disguise
them in dog-Latin, and use them, while it leaves
the discoverer out in the cold.

NEW ZEALAND is a country which is
blessed with great mineral wealth, and it
also must have struck all travellers and residents
what an immense amount of beautiful foliage
covers every hill top and valley.
So far science lias not done much to discover the
hidden good qualities contained in the vegetation
of this Colony, but there has been a lady at work
for the past 30 years, who has devoted her life to
actions of mercy, and being of benefit to mankind
generally. We refer to Mother Mary Joseph
Aubbut, who has spent most of her life amongst
the Maoris, and during that time she has been
fortunate in discovering the most valuable
remedies for diseases in the vegetation which
grows everywhere around us. It is most natural
that a country so bountifully supplied by Nature
in mineral should also have its vegetable wealth,
and we must all be truly grateful to Mother
Mary Joseph Aubekt for her untiring research,
and which will now bring in its own reward to
herself in the fact that her life has not been mis-
spent, but will hereafter be of great benefit to
suffering humanity.

If you suffer from any of these complaints
kindly give the medicine a trial, and note the
great benefit to yourself.
Sister Mary Joseph Aubert says she has kept
some of these medicines herself for twelve years
perfectly good, so that no fear need ever be enter-
tained of them losing their now well-known
merits.
The preparation of them all is carried out under
her own supervision, and only the most efficacious
plants are used in their manufacture.
The Rev. Sister has been for over thirty years
experimenting, ;md during that time has success-
fully treated hundreds of cases without fee or
reward; and, seeing the great benefit that may
accrue to mankind generally, has consented to
have the medicines put up in saleable form, and
offered to the public under the names of
PARAMO, NATAN AT A, MARUPA, and
KARANA, and which have been registered for
protection and to avoid plausible imitations.
Testimonials have never been asked for, but we
present a few which have been given entirely
unsolicited.
The medicines are not altogether unknown, be-
cause in whatever district the Rev. Sister has
been stationed there; are numbers of persons who
can vouch for the efficacy of the remedies.
ARCHBISHOP REDWOOD certifies that ho
himself lias seen and heard of many cures, and his
certificate, as printed herein, will go a long way
to prove that the public are getting a genuine
article, and not one which it is expected to sell by
extensive advertising, although there may prob-
ably be no benefit attached to it.
Sister Mary Joseih Aubert's remedies are
genuine, and can be proved by any person who
will have faith enough to persevere with them.
Sister Mary Joseph Aubert guarantees no
immediate remedy, but is certain that any com-
plaint as specified under the different headings
will bo successfully cured after a fair trial, and
asks all sufferers to obtain the medicine from the
nearest chemist, or if not kept by him, to write to
the Wholesale Agents, .Messrs Elliott Bros., Aus-
tralian Drug Co., who will advise them where to
get it.

In Sydney last Monday a white man with
broken boots was wheeling a Chinaman’s cart
round while John trotted alongside. Where are
the “too lazy to work” theorists?
D, S. M‘Kay, the well-educated, elderly
man who is missing from near Cardwell, had been
commissioned by the trustees of Melbourne Exhi-
bition to secure two live alligators, and had cap-
tured one on the Johnstone and forwarded it
South, He was suffering from a cancerous growth
in the left eye, which was slowly rooting into
his brain, and he was in a miserably weak condi-
tion. He prophesied that he had only a few
months to live, but was anxious to complete his
alligator commission in order that he might hand
over the =£lso, to be paid him for the saurians, to
a lady in Melbourne who had been “ very kind to
me since my decline in fortune.” The poor fellow’s
working punts, alligator-traps, clothes, rations,
&c., were found ashore at a largo mangrove island,
and he is presumed to have been drowned.
Dear Bulletin, —Be your par of 9th
July, don’t you think the rejection, on a techni-
cality, of Solicitor-General Byrnes’ application
for a vote a mere dodge to give Kanakilgrift and
Co. an opportunity of flaunting their impartiality?
Byrnes himself is the essence of technicalities, an
able lawyer, and about 34 or 35 years of age.
Consequently, votes and voting must have
been very familiar to him for years. A
present to fill in a form properly it is
only needful to be able to read and write, as said
form contains elaborate instructions. By the way,
the Solicitor-General, who hails from an obscure
Queensland bush-school, and was once honorably
related to the Hodgkinson milk-industry, has
developed a dreadfully haw-haw style, and the
unsophisticated would imagine that he was
born and weaned at ’Ome among the real awis-
tocwacy.—Smoker.
Writes a Maoriland correspondent :
Some very short while ago a farmer-looking, rather
short, clumsily built, and stoutish man, walked into a
bookseller’s shop on Lambton Quay, Wellington, and
asked for “A Golden Shanty.” He obtained the book,
and presently began to talk of Rudvard Kipling’s books.
How were they sold ? Were they liked ? What did the
bookseller himself think of “ Soldiers Three ? ” The book-
seller, and this present scribbler (who happened to be in
the shop) were complimentary as to the ‘ booics, but the
first-mentioned said he was informed that no one who
saw Rudyard Kipling could believe that such a sort of
man would or could write such stories and poems. “ I
believe,” continued the bookseller, “ Rudyard Kipling
went up to Palmerston yesterday ; I would so much like
to see him before he leaves town.” “He didn’t go up to
Palmerston yesterday,” said the bucolic stranger, “ and
you will see him before he leaves town. Look at me—l
am Rudyard Kipling!” In New York Kipling had a
more unpleasant experience. He compared Broadway to
a pig-trough. (It is not a broadway, and has a slight
depression, towards the centre.) ‘‘lf Broadway was a pig-
trough,” said Harper’s Weekly, “Rudyard Kipling would
have remained there.”
The first lines on Robert Lowe were pro-
bably those written by the late Geoffrey Eagar in
1850 after a visit to Nelson’s Bay, near Sydney,
where the barrister used to reside. The lines
were printed in the Politician, a Sydney
monthly :
The scene sublime—vast cliffs, huge waves that break
With deep’ning murmur on the rock-strewn beach ;
Such were familiars of the eloquent Greek ;
So trained, the orator formed his deathless speech !
A kindred spirit, Lowe ! taught thee to seek
Thy dwelling place on the resounding shore ;
Thy “ burning words ” were fashion’d ’mid the roar
Of angry waters ; here, too, didst thou speak
Those polished periods, soon to enchant the ear ;
This was thy home—thy inspiration here.
Nor —turning to the hill’s descending side,
Where winding paths lead to the vale below—'
Be the just tribute to her taste denied,
Beneath whose magic hand fresh beauties glow ;
Her skilful eye surveyed the work of toil,
Her taste adorn’d, His genius consecrates the soil !
Things have been outwardly quiet for the
last few days in Sydney, and for fully 24 hours
before this issue went to press not one banker had
been arrested. It is a cold, uneventful day now
when the police don’t capture at least one financier,
and the public feels as if the savour had gone out
of the daily paper, and life had lost its zest.
Probably the police suffer from the stagnation as
much as the rest of the community. Whenever a
manager ora director goes along the- street each
cop turns a hungry eye upon him, and ponders
upon how he wun'd look in a pair of handcuffs,
and if he is a big, brawny person the officer sizes
him up, and then silently feels his own muscle,
and wonders how much furniture would be broken
in the scrimmage if the bank man should fight
and tear his uniform. And the “plain clothes
officer,” as he wanders along, looks hungrily
and expectantly at the big financial institu-
tions, and is evidently struggling with an
inward longing to rush through the plate-glass
doors and arrest everybody on a charge of publish-
ing a false balance-sheet. Accountants, too, have
taken to roving in a restless fashion back and
forward before the premises of the big monetary
corporations, and sometimes they have to hold on
to a lamp-post to restrain themselves from burst-
ing in and auditing the books right off; and you
can hardly look out of a bank window without
seeing a liquidator about who is evidently ready
to rush in and wind up the estate there and then,
and declare a final dividend of $ of a farthing in the
.alleged £. Sydney is getting demoralised these
times, and pretty nearly everybody is considering
how he will get bail when he is found out.
Sir G. R. Dibbs says that since his visit to
England, instead of the nasty, ill-natured articles
which had been written about him in Australia,
his critics in England have been kind, and even
generous. People have everywhere assured him
that they were quite satisfied with New South
Wales securities, as long as they were kept in the
Sydney Safe Deposit, the only place in Sydney
secure from fire and thieves. Call and inspect.*
Much speculation amid Melbourne journa*
lists as to who’s going to Chicago.
An individual signing himself “ A Black-
leg” writes to Sydney D.T. denouncing Unionism,
and concludes by wishing that “a plague may
overtake every sneaking stump mugwump witii
his gas-bag of sympathy.”
Sayers, M.L. A. for Charters Towers
(N.Q.), has at last deserted his idol, Griffith. He
stood the Coalition, the murky Kanaka, and the
land-squandering, but the proposal to confer
mineral monopolies on land-grab syndicates made
him turn his back on the hitherto Great and
Good.
When William IV, first saw the words
Reform Bill, he asked “Is that me?”
The Sobraou-purchase business is now

Garr-Boyd, the ex-explorer, declares that
“the bite of a venomous snake never bleeds, the
two punctures of the fangs leaving two small blue
marks ; while the bite of the non-venomous snake
always bleeds when the fangs enter the flesh.”
He claims to have been educated on this matter
by blacks in the interior years ago.

SWOEN TESTIMONY.
Statutory illil Declaration.
ITIIOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 515 George Street,
, Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PUHELY HERBAL “ UNIVERSAL ALFALINE
PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since.
THE ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

A REAL MAN OF MARK.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Rams-
den’s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, afttr rm ny Sydney doctors gave him up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “doctors” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long,life to continue his useful mission in the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,
N.S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
“Herr Rassmussen, of whose famous Herbal Remedies
everybody has heard, has held the position of Lecturer to
several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became
known by the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of
which he has numerous tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic scientists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world —are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
had given up all hope.”— The Aurthauan Workman.
—Sydney, 9th January, 1892.
WHO IS RASSMUSSEN ?
“ Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. We have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was
awarded a Gold Medal fur his Alfaline Remedies, and he is
author of some valuable Medical Works. We hope he will
be as successful in Victoria as he has been in New South
Wales.”— The Essenden and Flemington Chronicle and
North Melbourne Advertiser.— lst July, 1892.

There is a gentle-
man at Malden-on-
the- Hudson, N. Y.,
named Captain A. G. Pareis, who
has written us a letter in which it
is evident that he has made up his
mind concerning some things, and
this is what he says:
* ‘ I have used your preparation
called August Flower in my family
for seven or eight years. It is con-
stantly in my house, and we consider
it the best remedy for Indigestion,
and Constipation we
have ever used or
known. My wife is
troubled with Dyspepsia, and at
times suffers very ilmch after eating.
The August Flower, however, re-
lieves the difficulty. My wife fre-
quently says to me when I am going
to town, ‘We are out
of August Flower,
and I think you had
better get another bottle. ’ I am also
troubled with Indigestion, and when-
ever I am, I take one or two tea-
spoonfuls before eating, for a day or
two, and all trouble is removed.” @

SPORTING NOTIONS-
Sing ho ! for Australian turf morality. At a
recent Sydney suburban meeting the owner of a speedy
mare told A he could have her for a race, when A,
knowing how good she was, put a couple of hundred on
her and was duly “sent for” by the stable, as she
finished nowhere. For the last race of the day, the
owner told one of our biggest racing men he could have
her, when the big racing man backed her to such purpose
that her price was 6 to 4 on. Victim A met the owner, who told
him to back the mare and get his money back, as she had
been badly ridden in the first race, and they were putting
another jockey up. A, finding the mare was 6to 4 on,
looked the owner up and said he could not back her at
that price. Mr. Owner pretended indignation at the way
his mare was being backed and declared he would
“ stiffen ” her, whereupon Muggins A gave a bookmaker
a couple of hundred to lay against the mare. She won in
a canter.

The following true bill will show how low down
the sweep game is carried on by our “ best...” stables. One
of our crack horses won a big race, and it was not till next
day the stable heard that a party of Chinamen held the
moke in Tatt.’s sweep. The trainer and “ first mount
of the stable thought they would do a bit of “ bluff on
the off chance of the Chinkies not knowing the race had
been run, so waited on the holder of the ticket and asked
for - halt of the sweep or they would “scratch.” “ John
merely smiled and no-saveed, hut offered the fashionable
jockey a pound for “ the welly good way he had ridden
the horse.” In the end they got a tenner out of the
Chinkies.

Dear Bulletin, —Your recent item concerning
the Tasmanian wood-chopping contests created a good
deal of interest and disbelief in Nyraagee, where a number
of the people for the last ten years have been doing
nothing else but wood-chopping. A trial contest was
therefore held last week, and as the maximum log ad-
missible for firewood at the copper-smelling works must
not exceed 14in., eaclicompetitor was given two 14m. dry
solid box logs. There were ten starters, and they pto-
vided an afternoon of the most exciting sport ever
witnessed in the town. Youth and downright pluck
won; the winner, a little fellow of apparently not
more than twenty years, had just enough strength left
to raise his axe for one half-second over his head (the stipu-
lated signal that he had finished), then he collapsed on
top of his logs and had to be carried away. The first log
was cut in 3min. 6sec., the match was won in Bniin. lOsec.,
second and third getting home in Sinin. Sosec. and Bnun.
45sec. respectively—the biggest chip weighed 2r.lb. . As
every woodcutter will agree that one 24-inch log takes
much longer than two 14-inch logs, the time of limn.
30sec. for the Huon River artist is very much doubted
here. In anj T case, Some of our artists, who fancy lb a I
they can give points to any comers, would be very glad if
the Tasmanians will tell them what sort of wood they
have been chopping.—Yours, Nvmageb. July 27, 1892.

Cooktown (Q.) is half-Chinee and half-white.
The Chows run all the gambling “shows ’ at the race-
meetings there. It is a funny thing to hear a dozen or
twenty of them scattered about the course, eacli with an
inverted apple-case and the dice in a tea-bowl yelling at
top pitch, “Now len! now len ! En-e-mor dan! ‘ The
programme usually includes an event confined to Clnnkee
horses—Chinkees up!

“ Apropos the George Watson statuette,” writes
Darley, “ I have seen him, as starter of the Melbourne
Cup, do what no other man on earth dare to do—an
extraordinary example of nerve. One time he couldn t
get the 30 Cup horses off in his usual style, dropping the
red flag from the side. I was looking on. He coolly
stood, on foot, right in front of the centre and shouted
‘Go!’ which meant ‘Come!’ In a moment they all
flashed past him."

Mr. George Upward, the Victorian amateur

cover exs. Sir William Clarke and St. Alban’s Wilson

Little Demon, a 3 to 1 show.
Bishop Bob-cab Smith, Anglican Primate
of Australia, has spoken to the hungered un-
employed of Sydney, when they were breakfasting
on a Sunday off the husks of charity. Bishop
Smith was “sorry” for the feeders, whether their
hunger was “ their fault ” or “ their misfortune
whether it was caused by “ their own sinfulness,”
or—ball ! it makes one tick —was “one of —snuffle
—God’s mysteries.” But ho urged them to “be
humble,” and that’s something ; and he told them
that he had “pity,” that they were to have
“patience,” and that ail wore to have “hope.”
And then, no doubt, he took, as aforetime, a
shilling cab to Bishopscourt (not paying more than
the legal fare, as a matter of high Christian prin-
ciple, and lest the cabby should forget to “be
humble ”).
Exhausted ami drowsy feelings indicate an im-
pure and sluggish condition of the blood, which
may be remedied by the use of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
It is the most powerful and economical blood-
purifier known.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. Wo
understand the Country Milk Co.'s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place ; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
The just-deceased Bob Lowe (Lord Sher-
brooke) accomplished his own political destruction
when lie introduced a tax on matches into a
Budget scheme. The pink-eyed man was laughed
into obscurity over that job. Yet anybody who
seriously considers a servant-girl in the act of
lighting a fire, and notes how she strikes six
matches at a time, and chucks half a boxfuil atop
of the coals, will understand that Lowe’s tax was
conceived in the purest spirit of domestic economy.
Moreover, the match-making industry is one of
the worst paid on earth, and ought to be dis-
couraged as much as possible in the interests of
humanity.

Pure blood is a life-long delight. It is health—real good health and
strength—free from pimples, spots, sores and aches.
Have pure blood by taking Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally, ana use
a really good modern soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap—externally, and you
ensure a clear skin and a good complexion.
It is a mistake to suppose that a good skin or a clear complexion can be
secured by Soap alone. It cannot. A pure Soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap
is an invaluable aid to personal beauty, but the first essential is pure blood.
This must never be forgotten. If we can’t have the blood quite pure, then
we must get it as pure as we can,
A man wants a clear skin and a wholesome complexion, in profession or
business. Else if he be blotchy, pimply, or disfigured, other men fight shy
of dealing with him. Let the man take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally
and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.
A woman needs a good complexion else her happiness is decreased, and
her charm to the other sex much lessened. Let the woman take Frazer’s
Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.

blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Let
the child take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur
Soap externally,

that holds disease at bay and gives health,
Frazer’s Sulphur Soap renders the skin soft, supple and smooth, neither
drying the oils of the skin, nor shrivelling the nails, nor splitting the hairs.

fat. It is simple and truly the best of all Soaps, and contains Oil of
Eucalyptus.

Miserable policy is the police reduction in
Victoria, so far as applying to the mass. We
never spare police incompetence from a conviction
that this class ought to be superior, as in New
York, where the wages, at large, are twice those
in Victoria, though not for the top-sawyers. There
are heaps of big salaries in the Civil Service that
could be lopped one half.
No other spirit is equal to Wolfe's Schnapps

“Russia’s poverty keeps the European
peace” —absurd remark of a critical sapiency.
Why, poor nations are just the ones to fight, and
look at France, in the Revolution, with its
assignats, even at the threatened bankruptcy of
the U.S., in the Civil War, with their greenbacks.
When King Croesus showed Solon his treasures,
that gentleman remarked : “If another should
come with better iron than you, he will take all
this gold.”

A “carrying company ” —now heard of for
the first time—advertised in Sydney the other
day for a clerk. One young lady who asked for
details was informed that the salary was £7B
yearly, and that she would have to put up <£so
cash (on which bank interest would be paid) as
security for her honesty. A fidelity bond, it
seems, would not suit this precious “company.”
Anyone who, in these days of stable guarantee
societies, wants cash as security of good faith
should be given a wide berth.
Wolfe's Schnapps may be relied upon in all
seasons as the purest and best of liquors.

Dear Bulletin, —The “ Water Conserva-
tion Branch ” of the N.S. W. Government is likely
to be a paying concern. I know of at least one
tank on the railway-line between Wagga and
Albury which was excavated by the department
at a cost of, I should say at least, £2OOO. The
tank referred to was completed by the contractor,
and duly taken charge of by a Government c ire-
takcr, over 12 months ago, and I am prepared to
swear that not £l2 worth of water has been sold
up to date. The caretaker gets as emolument
Bs. Gd. per diem, which, with £l2 per annum for
forage, brings his allowances up to over £1(17 per
year; this, with the interest on £2OOO at 5 per
cent., means a white elephant costing the State
not far short of £3OO a year. Fancy paying a
man Bs. Gd. a day, including Sunday, to merely
sit down and watch that no badly-disposed person
picks up a huge excavation and a lot of rusty
pumping machinery and walks off with it! -

Never refuse a nip of Wolfe’s Schnapps. It is
