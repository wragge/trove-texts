SOUTH SEAS PARADISE
Sighted not so long ago in “The
Bulletin” office with a superb crimson
beard that practically flowed to his
feet, Bengt Danielsson of the “Kon-
Tiki” has written in Forgotten Islands
of the South Seas (Allen and Unwin)
a South Seas travel-book to end all
South Seas travel-books; or at least to
end all travels to the South Seas.
The “forgotten islands” are the
Marquesas, and it is just as well that
they should be forgotten.
The first thing that Danielsson found,
after dining on cockroach soup, coping
with drunks and being kept awake all
night while the crew played poker on
the schooner from Tahiti, was that the
Marquesans don’t really like white
people. This is due to the fact that
Mendana, the first European to visit
them, massacred them right and left
in 1595 and—with considerable assist-
ance from an American naval captain
named Porter who devastated the Taipi
valley in 1812 because the natives
wouldn’t supply him with pork—much
the same process has gone on ever
since, though in later years usually by
the more peaceful means of syphilis,
elephantiasis, tuberculosis and alcohol-
ism.
However, in fairness to the white
man it must be added that on at least
one island, by banning liquor, the
missionaries have recently been able
to persuade the population to increase;
and, on the other hand, there can be
no doubt that, even if they were stimu-
lated by the white man’s firearms and
firewater, the natives contributed
enthusiastically to their own decima-
tion:—
The missionaries were now alone
with half-a-dozen gendarmes as their
sole support. Disturbances and
orgies increased rapidly. The natives
drank, stole and murdered
unchecked, and snapped their fingers
at all exhortations and preachings.
The so-called authorities could do
nothing but record crimes, and by
way of an example it may be said
that during the following twenty-five
years the gendarmes’ registers
include over 500 murders, which were
never cleared up, committed by
drunken natives. The number of
unreported murders was without
doubt much greater. In one valley
with 400 inhabitants, where a
missionary lived, there were forty
violent deaths in one year alone.
Among silent and hostile natives —
mostly engaged, it is true, in nothing
worse than sitting down nursing their
elephantiasis or occasionally bestirring,
themselves, especially on the 14th of
July, for a drunken and amorous orgy—
Danielsson and his wife searched for
a paradise in the Marquesas where they
could live off the land and be at peace
to write. They had had to leave their
previous paradise in Raroia because
both began to suffer from some curious
form of malnutrition, due to the
vegetarian diet, for which the only
remedy would presumably have been
cannibalism.
An American photographer, who
travelled with them from Tahiti in
search of dusky beauties and their
bosoms for a travel-magazine, very
wisely took One look at the islands,
one photograph of the only available
bosom, and lit-out for home. Another
fellow-voyager, a French painter who
was trying to be a second Gauguin, took
the risk of settling amongst the natives
with a.most ravishing model whom he
found bathing in a stream: he is to
be found a little later in the story
fleeing for medical attention.
Gauguin, of course, after leaving
Tahiti, painted and died in the
Marquesas; and Danielsson. along with
many accounts of Gauguin’s orgies,
found some evidence to suggest that he
died from an overdose of morphine
which he was taking to deaden the pain
of his syphilis and his broken leg. In
1902, besides his morphine, Gauguin
bought 224 bottles of red wine, 32
litres of absinthe. 55 litres of rum, three
bottles of whisky and 96 bottles of
beer. Danielsson met his half-caste
daughter on one of the islands: she
was suffering from elephantiasis and
“had inherited nothing from Gauguin
but his thirst.”
The Danielssons plunged into the
mountains to get away from the natives,
built themselves a palm-leaf hut for
a total cost of £26 (such buildings last
two years, when they have to i*
rebuilt), and, settling in with their
cats and two huge cases of books ac(
living on boiled bananas and tare
varied with melons, pawpaw, pin e
apples and freshwater prawns, fount
it tolerably paradisal.
The only apparent disadvantage was
that they had to ride over the moun.
tains to the port to get other provisions,
and Danielsson found a horse a much
unsteadier craft than the Kon-Tiki-
“Heavens, what a pace we went! I did
not see any road or path, but the horses
at any rate seemed to know where we
were going, for they crashed their way
through the scrub at top speed. ]
pulled on the steering-rope or whatever
I should call the ends that were tied
round my nag’s neck.” And when they
got to the store it was out of flour ant
salt, had only one rusty tin of bully,
beef and had sold all its sugar for “a
little party”—the natives make a home,
brewed liquor from sugar and coconut,
flowers.
But there was another, more serious
disadvantage: the mosquito that carries
the germ of elephantiasis. Both the
Danielssons became infected, and, after
losing each other and losing one of the
cats while Danielsson was trying to
catch the schooner at the various ports
in the islands, from which it always
sailed away just as he was approaching,
in the end, Mrs. Danielsson having
caught the schooner and Danielsson
the French Navy, they fled for a cure
in Tahiti.
And so, as the famous Janies Fitz-
patrick would say, we say farewell to
the Marquesas where Quiros thought
the women were “angels” and where
Melville, if taking a less spiritual view-
point as he frolicked with Fayaway.
more-or-less concurred. In spite of its
disillusion. Danielsson’s book remains
a lively, indeed a most enjoyable piece
of reading because of the gusto and
wry humor with which he describes his
dreadful experiences.

COMMUNISM AND COSTS
THE Communist leaders have acquired
their ascendancy in Australian unionism
by an unscrupulous but almost
fanatical —assumption that they and
those who supposedly appoint and
employ them, but who actually are
their cattle, are not morally bound by
any laws or by any consideration of
patriotism or regard for this country’s
welfare and progress.
They foster a policy of selfishness,
utter and unashamed, in the individual,
and of sedition in officials who, as
members of the committee of the Com-
munist party, have a second aim in
trying to destroy the national system
and replace it by a world system guided
and managed by the Red Gods of
Moscow. These every now and then
entertain them on luxurious trips
“home” for instruction.
A study of the economics of some
of the unions which their Red-anting
agents control proves how fortunate
the Commonwealth is that they are not
able to apply their principles in all
unions; if they did the economy would
collapse.
As it is, their success in some unions
has led to the imposition of a vast
burden on the community, the bulk of
which is paying for Communism,
extortion, loaf and sabotage in
industries whose economic condition
influences the life of every Australian.
The report of the Australian Steve-
doring Industry Authority, in a business
in which the Communists are so strong
and so arrogant that the Federal Gov-
ernment appears to be afraid to tackle
them, gives a stark picture of
what Australia might expect if the
trends towards the Left so strongly
influenced and advocated by Dr. Evatt
were universal.
The Stevedoring Commission has
now only power of “regulating” the
performance of stevedoring. A weak
point in the system is that the recruiting
of labor remains with the Communist-
controlled Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion, though the authority now has
power, where the union fails to recruit,
to advertise for persons desirous of
being waterside-workers, and to register
suitable applicants, subject to the
federation and the employers being
given an opportunity of objecting.
In practice this is not much help,
since the life of any person propelled
by the authority into the restricted
circle of the W.W.F. is very much like
that of a prime bullock which has been
declared a tiger by Act of Parliament
and sent to live in the jungle.
Mainly because of a rise of £2.1
million (to £2.7 million) in payments to
wharflaborers (principally attendance-
money, sick-leave pay and holiday pay)
which an increase from 6d. to 2s. in the
levy per man-hour did not cover, after
one year’s operations under the new
1956 Act the cost of running the
authority leaped from £l.l million to
£3.3 million, and a credit balance of
over half-a-million was turned into a
deficit of half-a-million.
And what is the net result of all this
expensive Government meddling of
which the trends and the nature seem
to be largely dictated by the Com-
munist leaders in more important
matters? There was a small improve-
ment in the loading-rate, but the overall
picture remained depressingly bad.
There are 44 officially recognised
stevedoring ports in Australia, large
and small.
In two of these, “the hours worked
weekly average per waterside-worker
of the real labor force” is over 35 —-
the maximum at Geraldton (W.A.), 41
hours. In six others the average is
between 30 and 35 hours. Another 25
average between 20 and 30 hours —
seven under 25 hours. The remaining
11 work under 20 hours, average.
There is only one port in Australia
where 82 per cent, or more of the work
is done at ordinary rates of pay. In a
few cases the percentage is under 60,
and the average percentage for all ports
is 65.1. The average on time-
and-a-half rates is 22.2 per cent.; on
double-time 10 per cent.; on double-
time-and-a-half 2.1 per cent.
The average working-week at the
“A”-class ports —that is, 31 ports out
of 44, handling nearly all Australian
cargo—is 27.2 hours. The average
gross earnings per man —“earnings by
labor, attendance-money, sick-pay,
public-holiday pay” (days not worked),
is £l9 ss. lid. a week. In “B”-class
ports the pay for an average of 16.3
hours is gross £ll 14s. Bd., and in
seasonal ports the gross earning is
£l7 9s. lOd. for 21.1 hours, average.
All-round, the 26,000-odd Australian
wharfies last year worked an average
26.9 hours and earned £l9 2s. lOd. a
week.
The Waterside Workers are not
wholly responsible for the shocking
result —Mr. Elliott V. Elliott’s followers
in the Seamen’s Union have their share
in the results of which samples are
given by the Stevedoring Authority.
Whereas sea-carriage should be the
cheapest form of carriage, it costs
£42 10s. sd. to move 20cwt. of motor-
tyres by sea from Melbourne to
Adelaide, against £8 by rail, door-to-
door. The comparative figures as
between Melbourne and Brisbane are
£54 4s. 7d. and £22. To take 20cwt.
of light cartons from Melbourne to
Adelaide by sea costs £2l 125., by rail
£6 10s., and by road £7 15s.
It is no wonder that the industry is
turning desperately to mechanisation,
which the authority thinks “fore-
shadows a decline in the work avail-
able to waterside-workers in Australian
ports.”
Major developments include bulk-
loading of sugar and bulk-handling of
grain in South Australia. Pre-slinging
of steel cargoes will be in operation
in Melbourne in 1957-58 and will
provide “a rate of work approximately
six times that of normal methods, with
50 per cent, lower gang-strength,”
having, as an overall effect, “a reduc-
tion of man-hours for waterside-
workers to about one-twelfth of the
total needed under previous methods.”
The coal-loading plant which will
operate in Newcastle within three years
will load 1000 tons an hour, against 90
to 100 tons with the present method.
The Melbourne-Tasmanian trade is
preparing to instal the “roll-on, roll-
off” method used in European ports and
America on a large scale—special ships
carrying 50 motor-lorries fully loaded
to 15 tons, which mean faster turn-
round and a much smaller labor-force.
Mr. Healy and his lieutenants are,
by their hold-ups and go-slow and
extortion, encouraging all these
methods by their policy, along with
palletisation of fruit, use of fork-lifts
and tow-motors, calfdozers in holds,
pre-slinging of cargoes, the increased
use of self-trimming ships. All these
(the authority thinks) “seem likely to
continue to reduce man-hours of work
available to waterside-workers.”
Presently, if the trend continues, the
Communist leaders may have nothing
left to howl about save almost complete
unemployment.
At present the race is on between
bankruptcy of the Australian, particu-
larly the inter-State, shipping industry
and mechanisation. The intra-State
shipping business is already virtually
dead.
If all centres in Australia were
connected by good roads and the dead
hand of the States did not fall on road-
hauliers, nothing outside very heavy
bulk-cargoes would be carried by sea
round the Australian coasts.


AN EXCHANGE OF CULTURE


PLAIN ENGLISH
Moon over Miami
Although the news of the launching
of the first American earth-satellite
lacked the dramatic impact achieved by
the announcement that Sputnik I was
circling the globe, it was very welcome
news to the Western world.
For most of last year the U.S. press
and the U.S. services fed the world
stories of how the U.S. satellites were up
and rearin’ to go. They were so near to
launching, it seemed, that pressing the
button would be a mere formality —the
things would almost launch themselves.
In the circumstances America’s best
friends could be excused for grinning a
little when the Soviet sputniks beat them
to the orbit.
One didn’t have to be a Red or a
fellow-traveller to feel an unreasoning
satisfaction at the discomfiture of the
American rocketeers. And, after all, no
one doubted that the U.S. preparations
were very well advanced and that success
was merely a matter of time. Even the
failure of the first American attempt to
emulate the sputnik seemed no reason
for wiping-off the grin. But when the
squib was succeeded by a phut and that
was followed by a fizzle the joke seemed
to be wearing a trifle thin. After all, we
didn’t want Moscow to have a monopoly
of space-travel, and, despite our grins, we
knew we’d feel a whole lot safer if just
one of the bits of ironmongery “up
there” had Uncle Sam’s name on it.
For that reason Saturday’s successful
launching was a relief, and that feeling
expressed in the voice of the eyewitness
broadcaster at Cape Canaveral —half-
incredulous, half-exultant—“lt’s still go-
ing up. I can still see it. It’s still going
up. And up, and up, and up, and
up . . . .” must have found an echo in
many hearts all round the world.
America had to conduct its abortive
“launchings” in the full spotlight of
world publicity. No one outside Russia
knows how many failures The Soviet
scientists had before they broke-through.
U.S. scientists and technicians deserve
full praise for pushing-on with their
experiments, if not with pride unshaken,
then at least with nerves unrattied.
The Explorer is only a tiny satellite,
but as the Russians showed by the vast
difference between their first and second
moons, size is merely a technological
problem. By the end of the year, it seems,
the sky wifi be so cluttered-up with earth-
satellites, Russian and American, that
some kind of traffic cops will be needed.
The prospect seems to call for talks above
the summit.
Brain-surgery
A middle-aged Melbourne woman has
been restored to health after 30 years of
mental illness.
This remarkable recovery was achieved
by a brain - operation performed with
an instrument fashioned from 305.-
worth of scrap-metal by a hospital
engineer.
This ingenious instrument made at
Mont Park Mental Hospital is
clamped to- the skull, and guides a
hollow needle into the brain to kill
damaged cells.
It is a striking example of the new
techniques of neuro - surgery being
developed in Victoria to reclaim lives
from the lost legion of the mentally ill.
The woman had been a victim of
Parkinsonism (“shaking palsy”)—a form
of brain-damage causing uncontrollable
tremors, rigidity, abnormal gait and often
severe depression and other mental dis-
orders.
Since the age of 13 she had been piti-
fully crippled in mind and body.
The operation, known as a chemo-
pallidectomy, was first performed in
New York six years ago. It has been
developed here by the neuro-surgical
teams of the Alfred and Mont Park
hospitals, with the help of the anatomy
department of Melbourne University.
The instrument used in the operation
was made at the hospital workshop from
scrap-brass. It would have cost about
£I2OO to import one from America.
Known as stereoencephalotome, it was
specially designed by the neuro-surgeon
and the doctor in charge of the surgical
unit.
Sydney doctors, who have been study-
ing the results of the Melbourne opera-
tion, are now having a copy of the
instrument made for trial.
The Papuan Future
One of the most hopeful signs about
Australian work in the New Guinea
trustee territories is the questing attitude
and open mind of the Minister, Paul Has-
luck, whose outlook lacks the dogmatism
which is usually characteristic of
Ministers.
New Guinea has been as much exposed
to anthropologists and reformers as the
Duke of Wellington was to authors or a
dog to fleas. Most of them have been
able, after a swift survey, to decide on
the right trend in education and the
remaking of native human-nature, but all
most of them have been able to do —
apart from the ones who have grown fat
on native labor—has been either to turn
the native into a loose caricature of the
white or to exasperate themselves.
Mr. Hasluck differs in that he is pre-
pared to admit the possibility that not
everything about the system is as it should
be. He told the Summer School of
Political Science the other day that he
“still had misgivings about education” —
which represents the crucial in dragging
Brown Brother out of the depths of the
dark ages. He is not sure whether, in the
job of imposing Australian culture on
top of Papuan culture, “both missionaries
and public servants are very clear either
about what they are trying to bring about
or what it is they are replacing.”
He is often “deeply puzzled when
inspecting schoolrooms and looking at
the many boys and girls who are applying
themselves so assiduously to learning
their lessons as to what is actually
happening inside their heads and what
effect it is having on the wlftle of their
emotional life.”
And he cannot be sure what the native
prodigy who “has learned to express him-
self well in English and who is the pride
and joy of his master’s eye” is thinking
or what his relationship really is with his
fellow-natives or his benefactors.
Experience in India indicates that the
prodigy’s thoughts are not often applied
in gratitude to his teachers.
Further, Mr. Hasluck has some mis-
givings about the unevenness both in the
aims and teaching efficiency of some of
those engaged in schoolwork in the mis-
sions in the Territory. He adds: “God
knows what some of them are trying to
do. I trust that He approves.”
In the light of the increasing financial
burden entailed on the Australian tax-
payers it is refreshing to find a Minister
who realises that on the one hand it is
necessary to build-up the country to sus-
tain the cost of its own Administration
and future services, and to provide the
average Papuan with an occupation and
an income, but who is not unaware of the
problems which have been illustrated
particularly in India and African colonies
in which the British have done what
Mr. Hasluck calls (in Papua) “one of the
worst things that can happen to the native
individual —to educate him to live at a
higher standard of civilisation and posses-
sions and then to fail in providing him
with the means to obtain them.” ,
This in India, Ghana and other centres
easily picked-out has led to throwing the
native into the hands of Communists and
other agitators and eventually to the
premature removal of the guiding and
protective hand of his mentors, leaving
him confined in a vacuum or unequipped
to stand on hi&. own feet in a wicked
world.
The Commonwealth Problem
A feature of the press approach to Mr.
Macmillan’s visit is its preoccupation
with Russian peace-talks rather than
with the relationships of members of
the British Commonwealth with each
other.
Yet some of the questions which need
regular and careful summit discussion
within the circle of British nations are far
more important than something which
can only succeed if Russia is prepared to
abandon openly the main tenet of the
Communist programme—peace through
world-conquest which would mean
repudiating international Communism.
A stage in history is being reached at
which the United Kingdom is staging an
impressive comeback, with the help of
Australian and other overseas contribu-
tions in brains and ingenuity. Harwell,
with the Zeta project in the peaceful
use of H-power well advanced, has be-
come the world’s main centre of advanced
nuclear development. In the nuclear-
defence sphere—at any rate in the practi-
cal field which counts most, the inter-
mediate-range, accurate guided-missile—■


British engineers seem to have achieved
outstanding success.
In the air, the Britannias, long sneered
at, are stealing the Atlantic passenger-
records from the latest American craft.
And the giants of the new era in America
are to have Rolls-Royce engines.
In the political field the voice of Mr.
Macmillan is clearer than that of any
other leader on the Western side, and
nations which a little while ago were
ready to follow only Washington are
turning to London as the home of sanity
and constructive thinking.
It is the moment for long-term plan-
ning in the Commonwealth, especially
now that Canada has reorientated its
policy to line-up with the United King-
dom. It is time for a great concerted
Commonwealth plan to harness the
nuclear power of the hydrogen-atom ; to
put the seas, which have always been
Britain’s kingdom, to work for the
exploitation of the vast latent, untouched
resources of the white-populated conti-
nental masses which are so little peopled
and so abounding in opportunities ; for
buildihg a bigger world-wide community
of British people.
It is a time calling for centralised
planning and co-operation, one in which
the effort of Australia, Canada and New
Zealand should at least run closely in
harness with the plans of the U.K. in the
nuclear - power, communications and
developmental field.
The best guarantee of peace in the
world would be a British Commonwealth,
close-knit, dowered with industrial
strength like that of the United States and
centring round the British genius for
invention and engineering development.
Strange Bedfellows
Amid the chirrupings of Comrade
Khrushchev, glass in hand, as he exhorts
Western Ambassadors —“Peace is all we
want —why can’t we sign a non-
aggression pact?”—the consolidation of
Soviet interests in the Middle East goes
on steadily under Soviet Union direction.
Following the sullen threats to Turkey,
which went on for months and which
seemed to be designed either to reconcile
Syria to something that was. being forced
on it, or to pave the way for something
of which the Soviet already knew, the
long-canvassed union of Syria and Egypt
has been achieved, and the Syrian Presi-
dent has expressed the hope that Colonel
Nasser will become the first head of the
joint State.
It is a most unpromising combination
for a national union—save for some
Power behind the thrones which has
strategic objectives involving correlation
of the military policy of both countries
and an immediate desire to prevent
Lebanon and Jordan from joining the
Baghdad Pact.
Syria’s aerodromes face across the
sea to Cyprus, only about as far away as
Springwood from Sydney. It lies athwart
the rail-route from Turkey to Baghdad.
It can control Euphrates water. The pipe-
lines from the- northern oilfields run
across it to Tripoli. It is close to Russian
territory on the n.-e. corner, and it
touches the borders of Jordan and Irak,
as well as Israel, with which it is con-
tinually in a state of petty war.
It is, in fact, in a central strategic posi-
tion, and its concentration pf populations
in big cities—two of which, Damascus
and Aleppo, having 400,000, and Homs
about 300,000 in a total population of
3,800,000-odd —makes it an ideal place for
Communist propaganda and Iron Curtain
control-organisation, especially in view

that Nasser has linked himself with a

full of Communists, whom he must
accept.
There is an amazing extension of Cairo
propaganda following the Communist-
organised conference of Afro-Asians in
Cairo, which is shearing through the
British and French African dependencies,
aimed to counter the truth that the Cairo
conference was a Russian instrument, and
stirring-up hysteria against British
“brutalities” in Kenya and the operations
of the U.S., the “colonialists’ banker” and
the “subsidiary of the colonial masters.”

greasy voice of Moscow is heard plead-

with no prior intervention by Foreign
Ministers. Something, in fact, like the
Yalta and Potsdam conferences where
the Russians succeeded in getting every-
thing they wanted from the Americans
and in separating them from the British.
Talks let there be, but it is to be hoped
that they will be on a realist basis, and
that Canada and Australia will be there.
Bolte and the Queen Mother
Victoria’s Premier Bolte is not going to
make the same mistake as his predecessors
—not in this election year, anyway. He
says he won’t hog the limelight during
the Queen Mother’s visit to Victoria.
Bolte will allow his Ministers to act as
official host at many of the functions
arranged in honor of her Majesty. He is
also quite determined to cut down the
duplication of formal introductions.
Brushing tradition aside, he and Mrs.
Bolte will welcome the Queen Mother at
Melbourne airport on February 27 with-
out an escort of Cabinet-members.
Ministers and their wives will be
presented at the State reception at the
Exhibition Building that night.
When the Queen Mother visits Ballarat
to attend the famous Begonia Festival
on Sunday, March 2, Bolte will see her
on to the Royal train. Another Minister,
probably Deputy Premier Rylah, will
welcome her on arrival at Ballarat and
make the necessary presentations.
Bolte wants to avoid the farcical situa-
tion of the past where a Premier said
goodbye to a Royal
visitor at Mel-
bourne’s Spencer
Street station, then
hurried by car to
lead the welcome
reception at a
country town.
N. S. W. Premier
Cahill was much
criticised for this
practice during the
visit of the Queen
and Duke of Edin-
burgh.
Another decision
by Bolte has created
an air of gloom in
some of Melbourne’s
stately homes. He
says he’s tired of see-
ing the same old
faces gracing every
official reception.
He has tried to
spread invitations to
official functions so
that as many people
as possible will see
the Queen Mother.
Wherever possible
he has insisted that
invitations be limited
to one function only
—and what heart-
burning this has
caused!

“Australian National Travel Association

710 with private baths, while Sydney has only
1540 hotel-rooms and 590 private baths.”
Oh, the Sydney skies are brighter
Than where Melbourne clouds

So the Melbourne skins are whiter
And the Sydney skins are tanneder.

So the Sydney baths are fewer
Where it’s harder to get dirtier,
And Melburnians aren’t more pure,
But they’re harder to keep purtier.

To “Australia for the White Man.”

BRIEFLY in Melbourne after
nearly 30 years in Sydney, I felt that
if Sydney is the Chicago, then Melbourne
j s the Paris, of Australia. Tree-lined
Collins Street, imposing public buildings,
broad streets with 20ft. pavements and
a profusion of gardens and parklands
lend that impression. Small city hotels
have this Continental atmosphere, too ;
friendly service and plenty of cool space
in bars —virtually unknown in Sydney.,
But the average Melbourne woman is
neither as elegant nor as decorative as
her Sydney sister. And Melbourne men,
once the best dressers in Australia, have
accepted the sports-coat-and-trousers-for-
most-occasions vogue set some years ago
by Sydney’s casual customers.

succeeded. One fellow, however, played
the game superbly. Not so much as a

vacantly into space, so Ryan wrote it
down and passed the note to him. One

puzzled by Ryan’s stance while he was
writing. He was taking off his boots
under his desk with his spare hand. The
Digger read the note and gave a curt nod.
“Plevna” waved him to the door. Giving

MALAYA REMEMBERED
By "EK DUM"
2 —The Japanese Objectives
ONE of the matters con-
cerning the fall of
Malaya and Singapore
and the Japanese drive
southwards which history has
done least to clear-up is the
actual Japanese objectives.
It is still a conviction with
many that the aim was the
quick invasion and capture of
Australia.
In plain fact, the whole
popular conception of the war,
both as to the objectives of the
attackers and the crucial ingre-
dient of victory, is wrong. The
Japanese plan did not contem-
plate the invasion of Australia,
except at the point at which it
had the British' and the
Americans completely beaten
in the Pacific and Indian areas.
The war was a naval war,
of which all the highlights are
naval, or naval-air, combats or
operations which were made
only possible by prior naval
preparation and bombardment
and organisation.
THE names of fighting com-
manders which will emerge
ultimately are primarily those
of Admiral Nimitz, Admiral
Halsey and their subordinates,
and the British commanders
who were engaged on the Indian
Ocean flank in the early stages
of the war before the Americans
had recovered from the blow
of Pearl Harbor.
British naval prestige,
curiously enough, suffered more
in Australia from the loss of
Prince of Wales and Repulse
in the open sea than American
naval prestige did from the loss
of a whole fleet lying in
what seemed an almost impreg-.
table base with every advantage
of observation, cover and land
defence.
The American press and the
Australian press * made
great play with the tale of
British crassness in sending out
two great ships without air-
cover. And the censorship made
it impossible for the truth to
be told—that the intention had
actually been to cover these two
heavy ships with the largest air-
craft-carrier in the; Royal Navy,
the Formidable, but that she
bad not arrived at rendezvous,
having run ashore, en route
at Jamaica. The other two ships,
having reached Singapore, took
the risk at sea when the need
arose in a gallant adventure
which might have paid-off.
They gambled and lost. Had
they won the reaction would
have been different.
Japanese Needs
nr HE Japanese from the very
first thought in naval
terms. They have always done
so, having regarded themselves
proudly as “the Britain of the
East.” They, like Britain, had
not in their own islands the
resources to conduct an all-
out war to the point of victory
over the other great Pacific
Powers.
They needed vast quantities
of basic war-material at a fairly
early stage in the war when
their initial accumulations
would run out.
These could only be obtained
by naval drives, with, of course,
the Air Force and thfe Army
as accessories. The reach of
all three services was limited,
but the reach of the Navy was
the longest, and it was the
means by which new extensions
of the range of action would be
achieved.
The primary needs of Japan
—urgent, indeed —to enable
them to maintain preliminary
conquests and extend them and
their range of action were
rubber, food (meaning rice)
and particularly oil. The need
to get these at once was
imperative, since it was certain
that in a very short time the
fuel for their immense Navy
and maritime shipping would
run out and need replenishing.
The main primary objectives,
therefore, were the ricefields of
Indo-China and Indonesia,
the oilfields of Indonesia and
Burma, the rubber and tin of
Malaya and Indonesia.
The direction of their axis
was slanted westward, not
southward, by the objective of
South Burma oil, control of the
Indian Ocean sea-routes and
perhaps the ultimate opening
of a land-route to Persia to
assure joint action with the
Germans. Their plan, as it
affected Australia, was only
to Isolate it, at least
a very long time. And
apart from that, even if this
country had been wide open,
with all the routes to it firmly,
decisively and permanently
held, the Japanese w r ould not
have attempted an invasion,
which would have called for so
much in logistical resources.
What they did intend to do
in the first phase of their war
was, as set-out in a previous
article, to shear through the
whole fan-shaped area of the
East Indian Archipelagoes,
throw a strong impenetrable
defence-cordon round it, then
intensively develop its
resources, while preparing for
the next phase. They proposed
merely to immobilise Darwin
by air-attack, include New
Guinea in the defence-cordon
to prevent it from being used
as a stepping-off place for
attack on Indonesian resources
and others within the develop-
mental war zone, and throw a
screen down the islands east
of Australia to disorganise the
Pacific Ocean routes from
eastern Australia to the United
States and Canada, so as to
prevent it being strengthened
as a base.
They were well aware of the
state which the submarine war
had then reached in the Atlantic
and elsewhere. They knew that
both the shipping and naval
potential of the British and
the Americans —the latter’s mer-
cantile marine appallingly weak
in relation to its naval strength
and its Army potential—was
momentarily insufficient and
dwindling.
They knew that Australia
could safely be neglected for a
long time because to them it
would only be a liability, with-
out first-priority resources of
oil, rice and rubber, because it
would take at least a year,
even if the U.S.A. concentrated
on it, to turn it into a base
which represented a real danger
to Japanese plans.
Planned Operations
/CRYSTALLISED in tactical
terms, the first phase of the
Japanese plan comprised seven
almost Simultaneous opera-
tions:® (1) surprise attack on
Pearl Harbor to destroy or
neutralise the U.S. Pacific Fleet;
(2) occupation of Siam to
secure a land-base for attack on
Malaya and Burma and to cut
British communications
between Malaya and the
South Burma oilfields; (3)
landings in northern Malaya
as a first step to the capture
of Singapore ; (4) air-attacks
on Luzon to destroy U.S. air-
power in the Philippines ; (5)
attacks on Guam and Wake
Islands and the Gilberts to
sever American communica-
tions with the Philippines and
secure the flank of the southern
Japanese Mandate islands and
establish a western bastion of
the cordon of which the begin-
nings were being built; (6) the
occupation of Hong Kong
(these attacks were to synchro-
nise to .assure surprise on all
these diverse fronts); (7)
invasion of the Philippines
immediately after the destruc-
tion of air-power there, with
the occupation of Luzon and
Mindanao. Jolo, in the Sulu
Sea, was also to be occupied
and used in conjunction with
Davao, in the same region, as
the bases from which the next
phase, invasion of the Nether-
lands East Indies, was to be
initiated along with the capture
of British North Borneo and
its oil resources, and so protect
the Japanese line of communi-
cations with Malaya on the
flank.
The timetable set for this
ambitious programme was
planned at 50 days. Generally
speaking it was achieved. The
holding-out of isolated points
such as Bataan, whatever the
propaganda effect on the
morale of the Japanese and the
value gained in knowledge
obtained by Allied commanders
of Japanese methods of think-
ing and tactical behavior and
morale, had little bearing on
the general success of their
overall plan.
Second Phase: Malaya
CJECOND phase of the plan
involved securing the
south-eastern corner (Rabaul)
of the defence-cordon the
fence round the newly acquired
resources which it was proposed
to pillage for the furtherance
of the war ; the occupation of
Malaya and the Singapore
base ; the capture of the South
Burma airfields arid all the
preliminary operations neces-
sary to secure air-bases for the
final attack on Java.
These operations—all pre-
liminary to definitive ones in
the constructional programme
—were to take the form of a
three-pronged advance through

Sir John Cockroft says of Zeta, the
machine that can produce sun-hot
temperatures:
Zeta stands for “Zero Energy
Thermonuclear Assembly,” and it really is
zero energy because at the present time
we get out of it only about one-millionth
of a millionth of the power we put in. But
it is the first stage of a long and promising
programme. If we increase temperature
from five-million to 25-million degrees
we will increase the power perhaps a million
times, and if we get up to 100-million
degrees we could almost break even.
The next step, he says, is to design a
machine that will break even. “Then we
might go ahead to the stage where we
can produce much more power than we
put in.”

Civil Aviation is examining the possi-
bility of establishing a new jet-airport for
Melbourne, also ways of extending and
strengthening runways at Essendon. An
official has said that Essendon airport
could be enlarged to take big jet-airliners
—“at a price”—but noise from the jet-
liners would still be a problem. A new
jet-airport would probably cost much
more than £3 million, he said, But no
matter what the price, Melbourne would
not be denied jet-services.
This promise follows a statement by
Premier Bolte that he was worried because
Essendon airport was not suitable for
jet-liners.
Qantas will introduce its big new
Boeing 707 jet-liners late next year, and
other overseas airlines might want to
use Essendon airport for jet-liners soon
after that.

A novel insurance scheme is operating
in Queensland, and it’s entirely free. In
the four southern States the Common-

issues policies which for an annual
premium of ss. cover medical, dental or
other expenses incurred as a result of an
accident connected with a child’s attend-
ance at school. The scheme has the
approval of the State Education Depart-
ments and is said to cover about 750,000
students. To introduce the scheme to
Queensland the co. is regarding every
schoolchild in that State as automatically
insured until the end of February. No
policies have been issued; parents of
injured, maimed or wounded youngsters
merely have to make their claim and
state their case.

happens when Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Smith

“Wusslean”: If a prize- were awarded
to Victoria’s champion bunch of
optimists, it should go to the Traffic Com-
mission, whose acting-chairman an-
nounced recently that “the commission
hopes that street-lighting in Melbourne
will be improved to-such an extent that
it will be possible to ban motorists from
driving at night with their headlights
on.” In Britain, he said, night-driving
with parking-lights only was compulsory
where high-intensity street-lighting was
provided ; research showed that improved
street-lighting had reduced night-accidents
by 30 per cent. H€ admitted, however,
that Melbourne’s lighting standards were
such that this principle could not be
adopted at present.

Writing in the London “Daily Express”
of January 24, Derek Marks, commenting
on the “Sydney Morning Herald’s”
import and Westminster’s export, asks:
Why does a man leave Westminster, turn
his back on his home country in middle-age
to start all over again in the Antipodes?
There are many men at Westminster this
morning who will shrug their shoulders and
say only—“ Well, that’s typical of Angus.”
For in recent years Maude has become the
chief dissident of the party, the man who
would not agree that black was black.
He has become typified as an embittered
man. Office, the goal of all politicians,
eluded him. Each promotion of lesser
persons became a cause for increased bitter-
ness.... so they say, the men who talk
in corners.
Not a very cheery send-off to anyone
setting-out for the wilds of Broadway—
what?
However:
Yet that is not the whole story. For
Maude is a man who believes in Britain.
He was a prisoner-of-war. He has raised
a family—and a large one by modern
standards. He was , the firmest of all the
Suez rebels in insisting that Britain must,
preserve her greatness.
Now he is planning to quit. The man who
once worked with Mr. Butler in the Tory
Central Office reshaping the Tory Party, the
man whose colleagues were lain Macleod,
the Labor Minister, and Reginald Maudling,
the Paymaster-General. What has
happened?
Well,
Maude believes the Empire. He will
not truckle to incompetence masquerading
in the outsize breeches of the mighty. For
him there is no place in the present set-up—
so he has decided to quit.
I think he is horribly mistaken. He is
one of the emigrants this country cannot
afford to lose. Authority has never loved
the rebel —and for six years Maude has
been a walking reproach to many of his
Tory colleagues. He was a reproach to
broken pledges, to idle boasts and garden-
party ffag-waggers.
Anyway, it looks as though Bob Menzies
won’t again have a chance of referring
to the “Herald” as Sydney’s Labor daily*
Still, one never can tell what the Broad-
way melody is going to be. Not even the
editor himself.

Sydney “Sun-Herald’s” Canberra man
discovered that Menzies had decided “to
hom-in on a press-conference” arranged
for Macmillan next week. He reported
that British officials “resent Mr. Menzies’s
determination to share the limelight”
and that “correspondents claim that Mr.
Menzies’s decision will kill the press-con-
ference” because his presence “will inhibit
Mr. Macmillan’s replies to questions.”
No other Sunday-paper reported the
story, and Menzies in an official reply
said, “This article is false.” He said that
in discussions at the beginning of the visit
Mr. Macmillan informed me that he had
had a joint press-conference with the Prime
Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Nash) just
before leaving that country, and that it
seemed to be successful. Without any
hesitation we both agreed that a joint
conference would be better than separate
conferences. Nobody was forcing this
decision on anybody.
He said that the rest of the article pro-
fessed to quote U.K. and Australian
officials. He did not doubt that these
quotations were untrue and that there
would be “an admirable opportunity of
testing their truth if the ‘Sun-Herald’
would let us know the qames of the at-
present-anonymous people whom it ven-
tures to quote.”
In Brisbane Mr. Macmillan’s public-
relations adviser said the report was
“absolutely nonsense” and that Mr. Mac-
millan welcomed the idea of a joint press-
conference.
Monday’s “Sydney Herald” published
the P.M.’s statement without comment.

Used-car dealers in N* S. Wales will
be required to be licensed by June 1 under
regulations to be issued on Friday. The
intention is to make it more difficult Tor
car-thieves to dispose of stolen vehicles.
Dealers will be required to keep records
of cars handled and to notify the police
if the number of any engine-block has
been tampered with, or if they suspect
that a vehicle or any part of it has been
stolen or fraudulently obtained.
Even if the licensing doesn’t reduce

Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker’s
Government has resigned after less than
eight months in qffice and there’ll be a
general election on March 31. At last
year’s election the Liberal Government
was defeated after 22 years in power
and lost 56 seats to the Progressive Con-
servatives, who thus became the strongest
party in the House, although they lacked
an overall majority and had to depend on
the support of the minor parties. This
has lately been withdrawn, and although
Diefenbaker survived a Liberal no-con-
fidence motion last week he felt that
stable government had become an
impossibility and asked the Governor-
General for a dissolution.
Liberal-leader Lester Pearson in his
no-confidence motion had demanded that
the Conservatives should hand over the
reins of Government without an election,
but the other Opposition parties didn’t
support him. Present state of parties is:
Progressive Conservatives, 113: Liberals,
106 ; C.C-F. (Socialist), 25 ; Social Credit,

[From Canberra]
Although the Australian Prime Minister
bas den j ed that Macmillan has asked for
a strengthening of Australian troops in
the South-east Asian area, that zone could
well loom large in the Prime Ministers’
remarks on February 11.
Reports have persisted over recent
months that Britain is anxious to see more
Australians in Malaya and the Singapore
region . There has been much talk about
strengthening the Commonwealth
Strategic Reserve
It would not be sur p r i sing jf a n
announcement of a rearrangement of
Australia’s contribution to the Reserve
fo)lowed Macmillan’s visit.
Before the Government makes any
decision, it will first need to dispose of
the vexed question of streamlining the
Australian defence organisation. Cabinet
has referred back to the Morshead com-
mittee the plan to amalgamate the three
Services departments, with the depart-
ments of Supply and Defence Production
under the Defence Department,
This did not suit the Ministry—parti-
cularly those Ministers who would have
lost their portfolios under the rearrange-
ment. But with the appointment of
Howard Beale to Washington the Prime
Minister is being pressed to reshuffle the
portfolios.
“The Summit? But why NOT, Macmillan? I’ve been trying to
get there all my life!”

Bryn Davies, Reader in English at
Adelaide University since 1952, and con-
tributor of poems to The Bulletin,
passed through Sydney on a year’s study-
leave to England, where as co-editor of
Adelaide’s “Australian Letters” he hopes
to secure more English articles on Aus-
tralian writing—the No. 3 issue is to con-
tain a study of Slessor by Richard Alding-
ton. A Welshman, he went from Oxford
to the Professorship of English at Cairo
University, but felt it was time to leave
early in 1952 after three of his colleagues
had been burned to death in a fire that
started accidentally in several parts of
Cairo Turf, Club at the same time.

The new Mayor of Auckland, Keith N.
Buttle, sketched in that New Zealand city

his late sixties, he has been an Auckland
city councillor since 1953, and, as deputy-
mayor, was closely associated with the
MAYOR
former mayor, the late Tom Ashby. So
there should be continuity of policy,
which is of special interest to Auck-
landers, since the city has some big
projects in hand —among others, water-
works development, the drainage scheme,
the harbor-bridge, bus-transport and a

Since Charles Brunsdon Fletcher’s
time in the chair, English editors, or at
any rate Australians who have had a
certain English finish, have been sort of
traditional around at “Sydney Morning
Herald.” H. A. McClure-Smith, who
became editor in 1937, went to school in
Melbourne, but went on to Oxford, was
called to the Bar in London and was on
the staff of the London “Times.” J. M. D.
Pringle, who was recently editor of the
“Herald,” is an Englishman who had
been assistant-editor of the “Manchester
Guardian” before he came to Sydney.
Angus Maude„ whose appointment as
“S.M.H.” editor has recently been
reported, was a financial journalist before
War If (in which he served, with the rank
of major, and was a p.-0.-w.) and was
on the staffs of London “Times” and
“Daily Mail.” He was one of England’s
post-war economic planners (deputy-
director of P.E.P.), was one of the Con-
servative-party members who resigned
over the Government’s acceptance of the
Suez settlement, and he has contributed
a good deal to various U.K. papers. Some
of his articles in “Time and Tide”
have been quoted in The Bulletin
occasionally. Politically, he is a vigorous
Right-wing Conservative.

William Allen Butterfield, the man the
N. S. Wales Government has made
Director of the Industral Development
Department, hadn’t started his new job
when interviewed by The Bulletin
—he was, in fact, on vacation—and so,
naturally, didn’t like to go into details
of how he proposed to set about attract-
ing new capital into the Ma State. But,
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPER
in general terms, he talked with sober
enthusiasm of the potentialities of N.S.W.
There were two big attractions for poten-
tial investors, he pointed out —markets,
and availability of raw materials. The
quaptdy of capital already invested in
the State was another not inconsiderable
factor, he said —for instance, roughly £3O
million at Port Kembla. He also tnought
it should be mentioned that the idea
wasn't entirely new —a small division of
the Premier’s Department had been doing
very good, though largely unpublicised,
work for some time, on the same lines.
A civil engineer, Butterfield has been
with the State Public Service since 1938,
in various departments. He’s large, sun-
burnt, and looks as if he does a lot of
swimming—he does, all the year round.
A member of the Bondi Surf Club from
way back —anyway, since he was a
youngster ; he’s now 45 —he's also presi-
dent of the St. George Swimming Asso-
ciation and president of the Cronulla
Amateur Swimming Club. He does a
bit of fishing, too —outside —and plays
golf at Cronulla.

“A. de R.”: A word more about
Michael Sadleir, whose death in Eng-
land has been noted on these pages.
“Young Michael,” as he was often called
in- the early days, to distinguish him
from Sir Michael Sadleir, Master of
University College, Oxford, inherited his
father’s taste in art. When I was at
Oxford in the ’twenties the “Master’s
Lodgings” was a miniature art-gallery
containing a remarkable, if eclectic, col-
lection of paintings and drawings. They
were mainly by modern or contemporary
English and French artists, although there
were also a number of very fine Constable
landscapes which —except for one or two


special favorites —had a small room to
themselves at the top of the old house.
Most of the French pictures, Sir Michael
told me, had been picked up by “Young
Michael” and himself when they had been
spending —as they often did —the Easter
vacation in Paris, going to art-exhibitions
a nd -galleries and visiting the studios of
their many friends among the younger, as
well as the already-established, artists of
the Quarter; Michael was then up at
Balliol.
It was enough that a picture was “in-
teresting” and showed promise—it did not
matter about the name of the artist —for
Sir Michael to back his fancy up to £lO ;
that was the limit they had set themselves
on these jaunts, he told me. Father and
son were more than collectors: they were
lovers of painting, and, as it turned out,
connoisseurs, judging from the French
masters represented —Monet, Degas,
Cezanne, Matisse, and many others. And
because Sir Michael firmly believed that
pictures should be “lived with,” and that
the education of the eye and appreciation
or art should begin naturally and as early
as possible, and go hand-in-hand with
the study of literature and history, many
of these works decorated the class-rooms
of the Hall School at Weybridge—a small
private school, co-educational and experi-
mental, originally founded by Sir Michael
principally for the benefit of Michael’s
children.

Magicians having been in notably
short supply in Sydney for some time,
The Bulletin was delighted to meet
Pratul Chandra Sorcar, who is currently
calling down miracles at Sydney Empire.
Mr. Sorcar’s chubby features and large
liquid-brown eyes seemed surprisingly
guileless for a magician with a clipping-
book the size of the Encyclopedia
Britannica and stuffed with cartoons and
reviews in Chinese, Japanese, Burmese,
Thai, Indian, French, German, English,
American and, quite possibly, Tibetan
and Urdu.
While artist Prior sketched him, Mr.
Sorcar talked softly of the seven genera-
tions of magicians who have preceded
bim, -and said that he has called
all his sons P. C. Sorcar, Junior,
in case one of them turns out to
be a magician, too. Mr. Sorcar’s conver-
sation was quite fascinating, but The
Bulletin was even more fascinated by
his dress, beginning at ground-level with
his nagrcti, or turned-toe gold shoes
elaborately worked in gold thread ; his
chost, or narrow pyjamas; and his
shiroani, or coat, of gold brocade with,
swinging at duodenal level, the impres-
sively ornate medallion of the All India
Magicians’ Club, of which Mr. Sorcar has
been president for 10 years.
Mr. Sorcar’s pink satin pagri, or
turban, was topped with an ostrich-plume
of snowy whiteness and decorated with a
MAGICIAN
taj set with flashing white and green
stones. The only discordant note was a
gold wrist-watch, heavy as an anvil and
costing, Mr. Sorcar said, £3OO. Still,
since it tells the time, the date, the phases
of the moon and provides other astro-
nomical and chronological information,
there’s probably a bit of magic about
that, too.

“W.”: When James Stuart Taylor
retired from Elder, Smith and Co.,
recently, friends from all over W.A.
turned up at the function. One of them,
W. N. M. McDonald, flew to Perth
from his Fossil Downs station in the
West Kimberleys for the occasion. W.
G. Burges made a presentation on behalf
of W.A. studmasters, and such well-
known breeders as Sir Edward Lefroy,
R. H. Rose, E. H. Lee Steere, P. Nichol-
son, L. Butcher, F. Robinson, N.
Fletcher, E. Bain, W. Hyde and J.
Ward backed up what he said about
Jimmy Taylor’s contributions to the live-
stock industry in W.A. with a few words
of their own. Also present at the
ceremony were some old cobbers of the
10th Light Horse. It is doubtful if any
member of a stock-firm has ever had
such an official send-off.
Jimmy Taylor came from Scotland to
W.A. as a young man, went on the land,
and then left to go away with the 10th
Light Horse in War I. Severely wounded
at the second battle of Gaza —the injury
has given him trouble ever since, and in
the early years caused long spells in
hospital—he wasn’t fit enough to go back
to farming after the war, so joined
Elder, Smith. Posted at first to the
Beverley branch, which at that time
controlled most of the business of the
great southern district, he was given
leave by the company to go back to
Scotland, and travelled all over England
and Scotland inspecting studs and
attending shows and sales. Back in
W.A., he was transferred to the Perth
office and given the job of attending to
inquiries. From this small beginning
the stud - stock department of the
company has grown to its present pro-
portions. Of recent years Jimmy Taylor
specialised in beef-cattle, and is recog-
nised as an authority well beyond the
Westralian borders.

ABORIGINALITIES
A T the Brisbane abattoirs recently
each slaughterman rejected a certain
lamb, passing it down the line in the hope
that the next bloke would do the killing.
Manager demanded whaffor, and was
given the embarrassed explanation that
the lamb had such a friendly look in its
eye that no one had the heart to deliver
the death-blow. Manager looked deep
into the aforesaid eyes, got the point,
and paid for the lamb from his own
pocket. It has now become the abattoirs
pet. —“Missus J.R.”

“Piston Pete”: No one vouches for
this story concerning Mr. Elijah, a former
“I had to get rid of her eventually—she used to follow me everywhere."
inspector of the Victorian Education
Department, but it has become a legend
in the Mallee. In that parched no-man’s-
land where an attractive school garden
is a rarity, the head of a one-teacher school
was busily pushing some young plants and
cut-flowers into the soil. Suddenly a
voice said, “Good-morning, I’m Elijah.”
Without looking up the harassed youth
replied, “I don’t give a damn if you’re
Elijah or Jacob or Moses ; just let me get
these in before the inspector arrives.”
“Sevenelms”: On railways and dam-
sites unvegetated cuttings and banks, so
often of exposed clay and acute incline,
have long been an erosion headache.
Such batters are now sustaining luxuriant
and protective covers of grass, thanks to
the backroom-boys of the soil-conserva-
tion authorities. The successful technique
is to blow a mixture of teased hay and
bitumen on to the problem-slope and
then, with a hydroseeder, spray thereon
combined water, fertiliser and seed.

“Shamuseen”: The plan for training
New Guinea natives for certificates as
masters of vessels of under 50 tons (B.
15/1/’5B) is .commendable ; but I’d still
bet that fully-ticketed captains will sail
by local knowledge rather than by recog-
nised nautical aids to navigation. Torres
Straits natives in particular are superb
sailormen. I recall one Cowley, a Badu
Islander, who was our pilot on a 50-mile
trip through a labyrinth of reefs between
our starting-point and Thursday Island.
It was a pitch-black night, and we made
fair speed for several miles ; then Cowley
would signal dead-slow and, from the
bows of the launch, make soundings;
and almost every time he slowed
he would touch a reef with his
exploratory paddle. Under his direc-
tions we would then run on another
tack at speed until he again gave the slow
signal. It seemed to me that he knew
every outcrop on the seabed in that par-
ticular reach of the, Straits. If the New
Guinea boys can add possession of a
mud-ticket to their local knowledge the
craft they skipper should be certainly A 1
at Lloyds.

“Villefair”: A Dutch acquaintance in-
sists that proper instruction could have
saved the lives lost in Australia through
cars plunging into deep water. In
Holland, where ice-covered roads skirting
deep dykes often cause similar accidents,
few lives are lost. People are warned, for
instance, not to attempt immediately to
open doors or windows, as outside
pressure would prevent doors from
opening, and water rushing in windows
would not permit exit. A submerged car
holds sufficient air to allow breathing
until the water reaches nostril-level.
Then it is a simple matter to take a deep
breath, duck down and push the door
open —the pressure outside then being
little greater than inside, the door will
open easily—and swim to the surface.
In our mild climate, where the driver’s
window all times is open, some swift
winding-up would be necessary during
the plunge down.

“Laetitia”: The American who, in W.
Hart-Smith's amusing verse (B. 15 /1/’5B),
was mystified on seeing seagulls follow-
ing the plough in an area far inland
would have been even more puzzled had
he visited Dynevor Downs station, near
Eulo (Q.), which is about 500 miles from
the seaboard. There, in what is one pf
the driest areas in Australia, seagulls are
always in strength ; some of them have
probably never seen the ocean, having
been hatched on the big salt-lakes for
which Dynevor is noted. Their presence,
plus that of odd pieces of coral and
fossilised marine-shells, seems an argu-
ment in favor of the former existence of
an inland sea. The Dynevor Lakes are
also noted for the large numbers of swans
which, in the laying season, litter the
shores with their eggs.

“E.D.8.”: It has been my experience
—and I have about 150 of ’em —that
trying to induce a deeper color into
Christmas-bush bloom by chemical means
is equivalent to feeding a boy on carrots
in the hope of making his hair turn red.
It is all a matter of heredity—each tree
keeps to its natural color. I had a bush
on which the sprays were nearly white,;
when budded from a good tree I got won-
derful results. A bush kept in the shade
will always have pale blossom.

“Mackville”: Anybody who has had
experience with choked earthenware-
drainpipes can testify to the amazing
things that thirsty roots can do. Solid
cement joints that have been thoroughly
tested and proved watertight can be
percolated and broken by tiny roots so
soft they could be rolled up in a ball be-
tween the hands. I thought I was beyond
the stage of being surprised by the actions


//

of water-questing roots, but an oleander-
bush growing fully 20ft. away from the
pipeline I was repairing showed me a
new ’un. One of its roots had found the
collar of a pipe, and, breaking away the
iron-hard cement joint, neatly fitted itself
in the annulus thus formed. A sideshow-
man should have been interestedI—no 1 —no
truer or more solid hoop ever graced a
hoopla-stand.
“Tomata”: A strange “boy” came to
our Atherton Tableland (Q.) farm from
the direction of the deserted blacks’-camp.
“Willy no more stop?” he asked. “To-
morrow Willy stop,” we replied. With a
satisfied nod he made off back to the
camp, and was seen a couple of hours
later fading across the paddock. In a
smooth 10ft.-by-4ft. patch of silt on the
creek-bank, near Willy’s hut, he had left
a “letter,” which consisted of hundreds
of twigs, stuck upright in the silt in a
series of rambling patterns and covering
the whole area. On his return, Willy
studied it for a few minutes. “I go, Boss,”
he announced. “This feller boy say, big
feller corroboree longa Ravenshoe next
week, all feller boy makim walkabout.”
“Leirum”: It is because of its peculiar
blood-constituency that the flying-fox
doesn’t interest mosquitoes (B. 15/1/’5B).
On the other hand, the f.-f.’s small cousin,
the ordinary house-bat, is sudden death on
inossies, and in the tropics this partiality
makes him a nuisance when, with superb
flying ability, he will pick up his winged
prey almost off one’s ear or nose. For
this reason dinner in a Torres Straits
Island bungalow during the period of the
south-east trades, when the bats swarm,
can be something of a nightmare, especi-
ally for those newcomers who hold a
superstitious horror of bats.
* * * *
“Spin”: The yellow-flowered banksias
are blooming through the coastal plain
north of Perth and the bush is alive with
birds. It is not readily apparent what
they all live on, since not all are nectar-
eaters, but you couldn’t get a better illus-
tration of the old adage that all flesh is
grass. The honeyeaters are there for the
nectar from the banksia blooms, and so
are the silvereyes ; the western-warblers,
the wagtails and the thornbills are feed-
ing largely on the insects which also
gather for the nectar ; and the ringneck-
parrots feed on the nuts of the eucalypts
and sheoaks. There are flocks of gold-
finches, bred from birds escaped from
aviaries, feeding entirely on seeds because
they eat insects only during the nestling
stage ; but there are also mobs of magpies
and crows, with a few butcherbirds, and
they’re all living well. These carnivores
pick up an occasional young or wounded
bird, but their living comes mainly from
the small bush life, the lizards and such-
like, which feed on the myriads of ants.
And the ants? Well, they live largely on
seeds, which the bush-plants set in millions
so that a few may germinate and grow,
but at this time of the year they’re also
gorging themselves on nectar.
* * * *
“D. 8.”: The odd methods used by
Chinese woodworkers (B. 22/1/’5B) are
paralleled by their handling of heavy
weights. As second-engineer on a ship in
Far East waters I had to arrange for the
engineroom-staff to lower a spare turbine-
rotor weighing about a ton-and-a-half
from the main-deck level to the engine-
room. I made a point of never interfering,
but on this occasion it was difficult to
restrain myself. Howevef, on the
assurance of the Number One I kept quiet
and watched them, after manhandling the
rotor to the engineroom-entrance, start
rigging a series of bamboo-poles across
the width of the engineroom. The gang
then hung a set of two-ton chain-blocks
from the poles, and lowered the rotor by
these to the floor-plates about 30ft. below
without any more trouble than if the
crane had been used. After that example
of the strength of bamboo, 1 wasn’t at
all surprised to learn that bamboo-nails
over 1000 years old had been found, still
efficient, in an ancient temple.
* * * *
“Bass”: Goats (B. 25/12/’57)? There
are thousands, possibly scores of
thousands, in the lower Murchison
(W.A.), particularly out from Meeka-
tharra, where they’re beating the sheep
for some of the best pastoral country
because they can live harder than the
sheep can. So they hang on better
through a drought and they’re on the
spot when the feed comes good, while the
sheep are still too weak to go far from
water. They’re good eating, not as wild
as mountain-goats, and every now and
again someone rounds up a few hundred
and ships them to Singapore, where
they’re welcomed ; but in Perth, only 500
miles south, you couldn’t buy goat-meat.
Butchers say there’s no demand for it—
and they’d know —but why isn’t there?
The meat’s good, often better than sheep-
mutton, and it should come cheaper from
those herds running wild in the Murchi-
son. I'd bilk at an old billy, but I can't
think of any reason for anyone but a
vegetarian refusing a helping of young
kid.
* *• * m
“Kelms”: Is a duck out of its element
on land (B. l/l/’58)? In W.A. most
ducks nest away from water —I’ve found
mountain-duck nests 10 miles from the
nearest lake —showing that when the
birds need security and camouflage they
seek it on land. Same applies to a
wounded duck. If there are reeds avail-
able it will head for them for shelter, but
it takes effort for a duck to remain up-
right in water, and when its diminishing
strength makes that effort too great the
bird seeks rest in the only place it can
find it—on solid earth. Ducks get their
living from water in varying degrees—
the musk-duck entirely, the black duck
and the teals mainly, and the wood duck
largely, and so on —but they can also
drown in water ; and most of them begin
life on land, mate and nest on land, and
are better equipped than most land-birds
for walking on land. Any wonder they
leave the water at the first sign of danger?
ITALIAN WORKMEN ON A

Morning slants down the road between
white branches.
And fences run on fire before the sun.
It is a magpie morning,
White frost, black posts, and gold light
singing
Down from high trees. It is a morning

Yet there seems nothing alien in these
Short strangers moving down the dust-

Under the olive tunnelling of leaves.
Morning absorbs them, the live darkness
Of faces, the bright stallion black of hair.
Their corduroys moving through the haze
of light
Blend the earth-colors I have always
known —
Dark cypress, wallflower-red of mountain
soil,
The faded corduroy-blue of rain-washed
air —
And the cold day is plumed with spurts
of laughter,
The earthy laughter I have known before.
It is a magpie morning.
White frost, black posts, and gold light
singing
Down from high trees. “Una matina

JESSIDE ALDRIDGE.


THE bee, the moth and the dragonfly
passed me at about the same time,
going in different directions, on different
missions, and propelled on wings that act
in different manners.
They’ve each got four wings, but if
you look at the bee’s wings under a
microscope you’ll see that the hind wing
on each side has a row of very tiny hooks
along the leading-edge, pointing upwards ;
and when the bee takes off they engage
in a ridge, or fold, on the hind edge of
the front wings. This ensures that the
two wings on each side rise and fall
together.
The moth has its wings locked by an
even more ingenious arrangement—the
hind wing has a sort of tiny spike pro-
jecting from its leading-edge, and when
the wings are spread this spike slips into
a loop in the front wing. (Only some
moths have this arrangement, and no
butterflies have it.)
The dragonfly’s wings are entirely
separate and they act independently, but
he can’t fold them because somewhere
along its evolutionary path it dispensed
with the folding muscles in order to
build-up its levering muScles.
The point I’m concerned with is, if
locked wings are an advantage to the bee
and the moth, and to wasps which also
favor this arrangement, why has the
dragonfly missed out? I suspect it has
something to do with manoeuvrability.
The bee takes a straight course and his
dinner comes on a plate; the moth
flits from flower to flower, and
his quarry doesn’t dodge; the
wasp, particularly the spider-catch-
ing species, wahts lifting-power; but
the dragonfly concentrates on speed and
turning. He can touch 60 m.p.h. and
reach top speed almost instantly from a
standing start; he can stop dead, turn at
right-angles, reverse, and gain or lose
altitude faster than the human eye can
follow. He’s far more primitive than the
bee or moth and maybe he could learn
something from them ; but I’d give a lot
to be able to follow the operation of those
four independent Wings when he’s racing
through a cloud of mosquitoes or turning
to leave a baffled swallow wondering
which way he went.

“Bungaroo”: A Victorian cocky was
stricken with a strange illness (from
which he barely survived) immediately
after wearing a pair of leather leggings. A
brother who wore them was also smitten.
A neighbor borrowed them, and he, too,
fell ill. The trio were wondering what
kind of an evil spell the casings possessed
when discovery was made of a snake’s
fang fastened into the inside of one.
Barely visible, it protruded sufficiently to
scratch (and envenom) the leg.

“Curie”: From February 1 Fijian and
Indian men will be allowed to drink beer
without a permit, though they will need a
permit for all other liquor. Fijian and
Indian women will not be allowed to buy
°r drink it. Part-Europeans (half-castes)
are regarded as Europeans by the law
and have never needed permits. A
brewery (no connection with the bill,
which has been advocated for a long
time) is being built in Suva and is
expected to provide comparatively cheap
beer with a lower alcoholic content than
Australian beer.

“Wandana”: When and where did the
billycan first get its name? My diction-
ary defines “billy” as “the teapot of an
Australian bushman, probably from the
personal name.” A “billy” was also a
policeman’s staff, which was a small billet
of wood. Reading the story of the mutiny
“Well, Warder, it IS the long Weekend, you know”
on Norfolk Island in 1846, I came across
the part the convicts’ “billies or tea-
kettles” played in the proceedings.
Trouble had been brewing among the old
hands for some time, and the night before
the mutiny the constables entered the
mess-room and seized all the billies
(regarded as the men’s private property),
placing them in the storeroom for
security. When the prison-doors were
unlocked next morning a strong party of
prisoners broke open the store and re-
possessed themselves of the utensils, but
disturbed nothing else. After breakfast
they went berserk, under William West-
wood (generally known as “Jaeky-Jacky”)
and committed several killings. Twelve
men, among them Westwood, were
hanged ; but what became of their billies
afterwards is not mentioned in the
records.

nrHE resumption of sperm-whaling off
the sou’-Westralian coast is beginning
to show unexpected dividends, one whale
yielding a deep-sea angler fish in good
condition.
This fish has a filament projecting from
the top of its head, dangling a luminous
bulb in front of its mouth, proving that
it was a female of the species and that
it lived in a dark world where lumi-
nescence would serve as a lure. That dark
world is the region below which no trace
of the sun’s rays can penetrate—probably
below the 2000 ft.-mark—and only the
female is equipped with the lure because
for a great part of the time, if not all
the time, she has to catch enough food
for her mate, as well as for herself,
By all accounts he’s not much of a
specimen, his dwarf frame being taken up
almost entirely with reproductive organs ;
and instead of having teeth suitable
for eating, he's settled for a group of
sharp nippers with which he attaches
himself to the female and literally lives
on her. In some species the union becomes
complete, her skin grafting on to his and
even the blood-vessels becoming con-
tinuous. Seems a drastic method of
ensuring marital fidelity, but such
measures may be necessary in that world
of Stygian darkness, where the struggle
for existence may be even grimmer than
it is near the surface.
Some day we’re going to have to learn
more of the world we call the abyssal
regions. It’s extremely cold and totally
dark, and it’s probably very still, with just
enough movement to supply oxygen for
the life it supports ; and the basic food is
what drifts down from the upper levels.
It’s sparsely populated and the majority
of the denizens are vicious beasts with
enormous mouths and insatiable appetites.
Not an enticing study, but it may be a
necessary one if man is to survive on earth.
More than half the globe’s surface lies
below 1400 fathoms of ocean.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
GADSDEN-HUGHES HOLDINGS, LTD.
WHEN The Bulletin last
had a look at the
accounts of Gadsden-Hughes
Holdings, Ltd.—that was four
years ago, two years after flota-
tion as a public co. —it com-
mented that “though the co.
was floated on the tail-end of
the 1951 boom, its earnings
have exceeded prospectus
estimates,” and that “the
business is strongly entrenched,
and oh the basis of the new
flotation it should shake-down
well in time.”
All that has happened in the
meantime has justified the com-
ments. There is plenty to
indicate good and prudent
management in the latest
accounts, and to support chair-
man W. G. Forsyth’s remark
that “your company has had
a very satisfactory year, reflect-
ing the results very largely of
economies introduced during
the year.” He also expressed
the view that “your directors
feel confident that the current
year should also prove satis-
factory to the stockholders.”
In 1951 the co. took over the
long-established proprietaries
of J. Gadsden Pty., Ltd., and
Richard Hughes Pty., Ltd.,
both engaged in N.S.W. in the
manufacture of metal and tin-
plate containers. The pros-
pectus put average annual profit
for the preceding seven years at
£73,647, equal to 6.7 p.c. on the
new capital. Though very little
additional capital has been
raised since, actual earnings as
a public co. have been well in
front of the prospectus figures,
and are still building-up
strongly:

Features of the earning posi-
tion since conversion six years
ago have been the large allow-
ances for depreciation
(frequently referred to by the
chairman himself as “liberal”)
and, over the past two years,
the heavy provision for taxa-
tion in comparison with
declared profits.
Last term, after providing
£105,249 (up £18,720) for
depreciation, £20,000 - odd
(unchanged) for the staff fund,
and £165,000 (down £2OOO,
"Does the Work of sixty-five girls — but, I don't know—
somehow one misses the girls”
following a cut in the rate by
6d. in the £) for income-tax,
net earnings were shown at
£182,848, a rise of £18,596.
They were equal to 15.6 p.c.
on average capital, compared
with 14.8 p.c. in the preceding
year.
But last year’s tax-provision
indicated a profit of £275,000
(tax-paid), compared with
£250,000 in the preceding year.
These estimates are equal to
23.4 p.c. and 22.7 p.c. on
capital respectively.
Whilst no doubt the board is
well aware of the capital-
erosion that would occur by
merely providing the deprecia-
tion deductions allowable in the
Taxation Department’s
schedule, it seems to be making
no bones about pursuing a
liberal depreciation policy, with
the result that the book-value
of plant at last balance-day was
only £402,423, compared with
£609,440 in 1952. And this
notwithstanding very substan-
tial additions to plant over the
period.
During the six years, no less
than £513,684 has been written-
off in depreciation, and most of
this would be in respect of
plant.
In all the circumstances, the
9 p.c. dividend seemed to be
particularly well covered, and
the reserves standing in the
books at £503,647, equal to
4s. 3d. per 10s. stock-unit,
would appear to be worth all of
their book-value.
Balance-sheet figures con-
firm the trend indicated by the
foregoing profit - and - loss

Plant dropped slightly in book-
value “in spite of the fact that
extensive new plant was pur-
chased for the various activities
of your company, but such
expenditure has been more than
offset by the depreciation pro-
vision.” Stocks were reduced
by £28,301, and at £853,338 are
lower than they were six years
ago. Freeholds, which were
revalued for the purpose of the
float, have in odd cases been
sold at a profit, which indicates
that revaluation was not over-
done in that department either.
The liquid position is strong
all liabilities being more than
covered by book-debts and
cash, and the bank figuring for
only £5035 on overdraft.
The group has recently
launched-out into plastic
packaging, and All - Packs
(Aust.) Pty., Ltd., has been
acquired (by the allotment of
119,772 10s. stock-units) to set-
up a factory on adjoining land
(bought last term for the pur-
pose), where it will make
printed cellophane and poly-
thene packages.
Another development has
been a tie-up with the
American Can Co., the world’s
largest canmaking concern, for
the “provision of technical
information of every kind
relating to the manufacture and
printing of metal containers.”
In retufn the U.S. concern has
been given a par-option over
130,000 10s. stock-units in
Gadsden-Hughes, exercisable
any time up to May 31, 1961.
Australian tinplate is now
coming forward from the
B.H.P. works at Port Kembla,
and, while not yet in sufficient
quantities to dispense with
imports, the volume of Aus-
tralian production will increas-
ingly relieve the Australian can-
making industry of the financial
responsibility of carrying large
stocks. This should, eventually,
have a favorable effect on
Gadsden-Hughes’s liquidity.
The board repeatedly stresses
the importance of “internal
efficiencies” and economies in
expanding its profits, and these,
at well as increasing turnover,
have coptributed to earnings.
7he future of the canmaking
and packaging industry gener-
ally looks to be favorable, even
disregarding such recent
developments as the canning of
beer.
At 16s. 6d. for the G.-H. 10s.
stock-units the sharemarket
gets an immediate yield of 5.6
p.c. from a 9 p.c. div. Provided
nothing untoward happens
in the near future, in view of
the conservative profit-estima-
ting, as well as the improving
liquidity, hopes of something
better than 9 p.c. before long
seem to be quite reasonable.

550,000 £1 shares in A.G.P.),
Victor Electric Plaster Mills,
Ltd. (capital, £525,000, holding
550,000 £1 shares) and
Peninsula Plaster Co., Ltd.
(capital, £262,500; holding,
275,000 £1 shares).
The three cos., in short, own
two-fifths, two-fifths and one-
fifth respectively of the capital
of the operati'ng-co., and their
own capitals are strictly in pro-
portion. So that the holder of
100 shares in any of the three
public cos. has an equal
equity in the operating-co.
Australian Gypsum, Ltd., is
the one holding-co. registered in
Sydney and listed on Sydney
’Change. The other two are
listed in Melbourne.
Sydney has always been the
principal market for gypsum
shares, the two Melbourne cos.,
until last year, having been
privately controlled, and
unknown to Melbourne in-
vestors.
Because the activities and
nature of the operating-co. are
not so well known in Mel-
bourne, on the day recently
that Australian Gypsum shares
sold at 395. in Sydney, Victor
Plaster and Peninsula Plaster
shares were on offer at 345. 6d.
in Melbourne. (All issues have
since come more into line, but
there is still a big gap.)
Yet a £1 share in any of the
three holding-cos. has a similar
equity in the operating-co.
It would seem that a merger
of the three cos. into one hold-
ing-co. (as was done with the
operating-co. a quarter-century
ago), followed by listing on all
the principal Stock Exchanges,
would provide shareholders
with a far better market for
their shares, and would
eliminate some of the probate-
duty problems which could
now arise from inter-State buy-
ing.
The Gypsum combination of
holding-cos. have the example
of Australian Cement, Ltd., and
Kandos Cement, Ltd., to study
in making a decision on this
matter.
Though these two cement
holding-cos. have an equal
interest in Australian Portland
Cement Pty. and have similar
paid-up capitals of their own,
shares in the two holding-cos.
are frequently quoted at widely
disparate prices. (At the
moment they are fairly closely
in line.)
As to the investment-value of
the Gypsum cos., as The
Bulletin noted in a review
last year, the operating-co.’s
figures suggest “earning-muscle
and financial liquidity.”
Disclosed earnings were
equal to about 20 p.c. on the
holding-cos.’ capitals, and,
judged on the taxation provi-
sion, could have been as much
as 30 p.c. The dividend paid
by each holding-co. was 10 p.c.
Net tangible assets at over
435. for each £1 share held are
probably as conservatively
valued as the profit appears to
be conservatively estimated.

ment between Waltons-Sears

“The Wap-et Story”
[From l. Owen]
A BEAUTIFULLY - PRO-
DUCED booklet, prepared
by West Australian Petroleum
Pty., Ltd., deals with Wapet’s
sustained and courageous
endeavors to find commercial
oil in W.A. The story of this
pertinacity is one of which any
oil-company could be proud;
it has been equalled only a
score or so of times, and has
very rarely been surpassed in
the l° n 8 history of the oil-game.
The Wapet Story must have
been expensive to produce, but
it is a booklet which should be
placed in every high-school in
the Commonwealth ; it will

help the younger generation to
become oil-minded, and it will
be an urge to those whose
inclination is that way to seek
the specialised training so
essential for the successful hunt
for petroleum.
The opening section reviews
operations completed and
future plans. This is followed
by an outline of field-work,
dealing with geological, gravity-
meter, airborne-magnetometer
and seismograph survey
methods, and with structure-
drilling.
The third section describes
the coastal district which
includes the Perth and
Carnarvon Basins—and the
work accomplished in elucida-
ting the nature of the under-
lying structures.
A fourth section covers the
Kimberley district, with its
Canning and Fitzroy Basin
structures.
Other matters dealt with are
“Planning Ahead,” “Training
Programm e,” “Exploration
Teamwork,” and a final section
gives details of the several
types of drilling-rigs on the
job and of their specific uses.
This last section contains
information which should be
highly interesting and informa-
tive to most laymen, particu-
larly as it is not otherwise
easily available.
Statistical information indi-
cates how the total expenditure,
to 30/9/’57, of nearly £l3
million has been distributed ; it
also shows the numbers of
wells drilled and their total
footage. The average cost per
foot of exploratory and struc-
ture wells is given, and, in
addition, the highest and lowest
cost per foot in individual
wetls.
The numerous photographs
(including some superb coior-
prints) illustrating the several
phases of the many operations,
have been expertly taken and
reproduced, and are well
chosen.
The concluding paragraph
reads: —
Several years of work —hard
work—lie ahead of us, and we
believe we have the best equipment
and the best men available to the
oil industry here in Western Aus-
tralia. If oil is here in commercial
quantity we stand a reasonable
chance of finding jt.
The wonder remains that,
after nearly seven years of work
—unsparing both in energy and
finance that commercial
petroleum has not yet been
struck. The answer appears to
lie in the tragic will-o’-the-wisp,
so unexpectedly encountered in
the “discovery” well, Rough
Range I—a1 —a misleading (and
misinterpreted) pocket of oil.
The Bulletin has attempted
to point out that fact for many
years past.
From recent statements by
Wapet it appears that the Bird-
rong sandstone phantom has
been laid low. The necessity
for employing men —
particularly on the geological
field-staff —who have gained
their oilfield experience in the
hard school of seepage-areas,
however, does not seem to have
been met, as yet.
Bearing Service (Holdings)
BEARING SERVICE
(HOLDINGS), LTD.,
which was reviewed in B.
18/12/’57, has been appointed
sole distributor in Australia
and N.Z. for Australian
Timken Pty., Ltd., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Timken
Roller Bearing Co., of Canton,
Ohio, U.S.A., the largest
tapered-bearing manufacturer
in the world. The Australian
factory, at Ballarat (Vic.), i s
expected to be in production
by June.
The new agreement with
Bearing Service (Holdings) will
operate in Victoria from
December 1, 1958, and in all
other States from March 1
1958.
On the same dates the Bear-
ing Service group, which has
subsidiaries in every State, will
cease to act as distributors for
bearings made in England by
British Timken, Ltd., which has
formed its own Australian sub-
sidiary co. to act as distributors
of the British Timken products
and F.B.C. ball and parallel-
roller-bearings.
Until the Ballarat factory is
able to produce a full range
of tapered bearings, the Bear-
ing Service group will draw
its supplies from the seven
Timken plants in the U.S.A.
or from the Canadian plant.
Up till now all Bearing
Service supplies have been
imported. In addition to the
British Timken and Fischer
(F.8.C.) bearings, it has been
distributing Hoffman bearings,
as well as supplies from other
manufacturers in the U.K.,
U.S.A. and Switzerland. In its
last financial year the group
earned nearly 40 p.c. on
capital and paid a 15 p.c.
dividend. It is a prosperous
enterprise.

The Great Sorcar
Trickery must not only be
done, but must be seen to be
done ; and at Sydney Empire
on Friday night it was quite
clear that Sorcar cut a lady in
haKes with a circular saw. Was
he not as cut-up himself as so
cheerful a little man could be
when the lady failed to come
out of her trance at the end of
this easy operation, and did not
his two assistants then remove
the body from the operating-
table in two sections, from the
waist up and from the waist
down?
Nor could there be any
doubt that after an Indian maid
had been enclosed in a small
box Sorcar and his assistants
transfixed her with a dozen
swords thrust diagonally in
various places through the box,
nor that when the end of the
box was opened there were the
swords passing through it at
many angles, but no Indian
maid —nor that, the box closed
again and the swords with-
drawn, the Indian maid pushed
the lid up and sprang out.
Nor could any reasonable
person who was there deny
that whenever Sorcar waved
a big butterfly-net it filled from
nowhere with a duck or a
pigeon; nor that all those
flowers and colored cloths in
“The Enchanted Garden” came
out of that empty cylinder,
although the flowers looked
rather like big brothers of the
kind the Magic-in-the-Home
books say you can get in the
magic-shops.
But with some of the tricks
it wasn’t quite clear what one
was supposed to see. No doubt
Sorcar did cut off and then put
back again the tongue of a
young Indian gentleman, but
large as the tongue was when
exhibited before the operation,
and impressed as were the
members of the audience who
came on stage to witness the
miracle (they included, said
Sorcar, two doctors and" a
dentist, and made a charming
grouping in the American neo-
primitive style of painting
small-town people), the present
reviewer would be unable to
say “of his own knowledge,”
as the lawcourts put it, what
really happened.
Then the business of walking
away from a shadow thrown
on a screen was rather indeter-
minate, as Sorcar walked away
in the dark, the only proof
being a torch he flashed —Dal
Stivens has managed this
illusion much better in his new
book The Scholarly Mouse
and the game in which Sorcar
covered his eyes with dough
and then a handkerchief and
added up sums which members
of the audience drew on a
blackboard went on until you’d
have thought he was catching-
up on his homework in the
customers’ time.
The reviewer’s number-one
son threw a little too much
light on the last marvel, the
brilliantly - colored flowers
springing up at a wave of the
hand against a black stage, as
all being done with ultra-violet
lamps ; but the childlike delight
of Sorcar in his sorceries, the
charming Indian maids in their
national costumes, the pro-
fusion of magical boxes and
shining instruments, and the
general speed and smoothness
of the presentation, made it
quite a pleasing night's enter-
tainment.

“Salad Days”
Audiences and critics seem to
be in two minds about the
Elizabethan Theatre’s latest
offering—a musical invention
by Julian Slade and Dorothy
Reynolds. It has more “Punch”
than pep, and that probably
explains it—if you like your
“Punch” you’ll probably like
the airy eccentricities of crack-
pot uncles, unconventional
policeman, society mothers and
university graduates and the
tale of a fanciful little piano On
wheels (fitted for after-dark
hours with oil-burning lamps
and a tail-light) which, with
some of the Pied Piper’s magic,
compels people to dance in the
park.
Present commentator and
“Punch” addict —enjoyed ’em
all immensely.
There’s another reason for
being pleased or peeved about
it. Its songs, light and tuneful
little ditties though they are,
all seem disturbingly familiar.
“We’re looking for a piano,”
for instance, takes one straight
back to Renate Muller singing
“I don’t know why I’m happy,”
and most of the other tunes
leave you with the feeling of
having been there before —an
experience which infatuates
some as readily as it infuriates
others.
Again, the present com-
mentator, without being
infatuated or infuriated, found
most of the ditties light, simple
and fresh, particularly “1 sit in
the sun,” “It’s easy to sing,”
and the apparently spontaneous
Oh, look at me! Oh,
Look at me! ■ Oh,
Look at me! I’m dancing!
Judy Banks, with John
Proper, does most of the work,
and, if her voice a trifle
thin to commence, whether due
to her increasing confidence or
to the audience’s increasing
appreciation, it soon seemed to
fill the theatre adequately.
Lou Vernon adds human
warmth and an odd dignity to
the role of the tramp-owner of
the piano and, later, an absent-
minded sprightliness to the
Bishop whose feet lead him
into a sedate little measure
while he is still studying a book.
Frank Lloyd, as “Troppo,”
does a neat and wordless job in
a part that is all mime and
dancing.
The dressing throughout is
light without being pastel, and
colorful without being vivid—
in fact, perfectly in accord with
the rest of the production.

Organ Society Convention
Sydney Organ Society’s 1958
Convention was a five-day
affair with the altogether
worthy object of recrowning
the king of instruments.
Herbert Cannon, the A.B.C.’s
director of music, officially
opened the convention, after
which Mervyn Byers gave a
recital in St. Andrew’s
Cathedral. His programme
was adventurous: no fewer
than five contemporary com-
posers were represented. Re-
freshing, indeed—in bloating
programmes with Bach many
organists may be paving the
way for a downfall of Bach, or
at least a Tschaikowskyish
obscurity.
In the interests of audience-
interest you’ve got to start and
conclude a recital with strong
pieces; Mr. Byers kicked-off
with the Bach Fantasia and
Fugue in G Minor. Compared
with the Jeanne Demessieux
recording of this it seemed that
Mr. Byers treated the Fantasia
as a toccata and took the
Fugue a good deal slower than
the Frenchwoman. This could
have been disastrous in the
hands of a lesser tone-colorist
than Byers, but in the Fantasia
two points compensated: the
bold registration in the open-
ing bars and, in the section
where there is a descending
pedal-passage regularly break-
ing-back in sevenths, like a
giant walking, a clever build-
up of tone in the rising manual
chords.
In the (slow) Fugue there
were two refreshing spots
where Mr. Byers used baroque
tone (choir flutes and muta-
tions, with light swell coupled),
and the seats trembled at the
showers of rich strength hurled
above the final pedal-entry.
Clerambault’s “Basse et
Dessus de Trompette,” last
heard when the blind organist
Marchal was in Sydney in 1953,
is a rippling three-cornered
dialogue between soft flute,
bright flute and trumpet. The
next item, a vigorous Psalm
Prelude by Herbert Howells,
showed Mr. Byers to be
thoroughly at home with con-
temporary music. Two little
pieces by Whitlock followed:
“Plaint,” featuring a reflective
melody on that most reflective
stop, the solo orchestral oboe,
against string and flute tone;
and “Chanty,” a merry chase
of flutes with a da capo on
light diapasons.
The Flor Peeters “Toccata,
Fugue and Hymne on ‘Ave
Maris Stella’ ” was the best
interpretation of the evening:
from the opening, with its long
pedal-notes under very loud
manual arpeggi, to the
rambling, ill-developed Fugue
and the strident Hymne, it was
an original and pleasing read-
ing. Sumsion’s “Allegretto”
had a pastoral character about
it, even allowing for that
chrpmatic descent halfway
through, and a short, mediocre
piece by Seth Bingham, an

“The Member of the
Wedding”
Carson McCullers’s play,
current at North Sydney
Independent, stresses through
its pre-teenage central character
a situation scented with
bewilderment and loneliness,
plus a dash or two of racial
prejudice to keep things lively.
Set in the Deep South, the
story revolves around three
main figures. The first, Frankie
Addams, is half-child half-
woman, not understanding or
belonging; when her brother
is on the eve of marriage, she
decides to join the couple on
their honeymoon trip; to
travel, become famous, to
identify herself with the
happiness she imagines will be
theirs.
No. 2 is Berenice Sadie
Brown, the colored household
cook, living with the memory
of one happy marriage, existing
after four unhappy ones. The
third figure is John Henry
West, a youngster (about nine)
confined to a thinly concealed
world of unbalance and
insecurity. *
Add a few violent negro-v.-
white episodes (negro pulls
razor on white, is jailed,
hangs himself in his cell), stir
well, garnish with one or two
incidental characters and you
have quite a potpourri. Yet it
is never ill-balanced; the
atmosphere of loneliness is sus-
tained through the whole three
acts, due largely, perhaps, to the
febrile mood-changes and
unpredictability of that fight-
.the-world tomboy Frankie
Addams. Honor must be
satisfied, and Frankie is too
human a creation to remain
adolescent for three acts. So
in the final act she exhaust? her
big guns and tumbles' off her
pedestal.
Acting-honors fell about
evenly to Mary Hosking as
Berenice Sadie Brown, and
Sophie Krantz as Frankie,
although Miss Krantz’s part
was undoubtedly the more
difficult.
Dennis Glenny was
excellent as T. T. Williams,
Berenice’s colored boyfriend,
and Honey Camden Brown, the
negro suffering a bitter racial
complex, sprang to loud-voiced
life via Rodney Milgate.
Donald Reid overplayed
Frankie’s father, Dennis
Carroll was gangl i n g 1 y
adolescent as Barney McKean,
and youthful Donald Kennedy
turned in a good performance
as John Henry West.
The young newlyweds
Frankie hopes to run off with
(but doesn’t) were rather color-
less alongside the vitality of the
central figures ; and, of the trio
of ponytailed teenagers,
Marilyn Lee Morey cut a fine
dash as Helen Fletcher,
ostensibly Frankie’s best friend.
A thumbnail-sketch of an old
bean-seller, Sis Laura, was
excellently pencilled by Neroli
Whittle.
Clever sets, smooth produc-
tion, good lighting—altogether,

“The Enemy Below”
Here is a first-rate American
war-film —a struggle of minds
between the captain of a Ü-
boat and the skipper of the
U.S. destroyer which is relent-
lessly pursuing it.
Each skipper uses the same
device of putting himself
mentally in the other’s place
and working out what he would
do to counter the move made
against him. They also share a
growing distaste for war
although professionally deter-
mined to destroy the other’s
craft.
The battle of wits and tactics •
goes on, with each man drawing
upon both long combat-experi-
ence and lively intelligence;
and each grappling with an
adversary he sees only as a
dot on a screen, at times not
at all. The climax, when the
torpedoed destroyer rams the
sub. in a last desperate effort,
and the two captains meet in
mutual respect on the deck
of the rescuing U.S. vessel, is
credibly satisfying.
Curt Jurgens gives an
admirable portrait of the
German ; and Robert Mitchum,
as his Yank opponent, is also
right on the ball.

“111 Met by Moonlight”
In 1944 two British officers
conceived the plan of kid-
napping Major-General Kriepe,
who commanded 30,000
German paratroopers on
occupied Crete. Posing as
Cretan peasants, they studied
his habitual movements in
detail, then dressed as German
military-police, and, helped by
a band of fanatical Cretan
guerrillas, they stopped the
general’s car one night on a
hairpin-bend in hilly country
and made off with him on a
highly hazardous trek across the
mountains to the coast and a
rendezvous with a British
destroyer.
The British screen-version of
this episode has all the atten-
tion to Service detail, the under-
statement and the little touches
of deft humor that distinguish
the best war-films that come out
of Pinewood. The splendid
camera-work in the rugged,
razorback-mountain country
which faced the kidnappers
points-up the herculean nature
of their task, and crisp direction
keeps up the excitement
throughout.
Dirk Bogarde, as the leader
of the venture, makes another
of his good impressions, and
Marius Goring’s captured
general is a neat study in stiff
correctness.

“Short Cut to Hell”
Some straining after melo-
dramatic effect mars the last
10 minutes of-this crime-thriller,
but by and large it adds-up to
a potent study of a remorse-
less young hired assassin. He
accidentally discovers that his
hirer has reported the money
he is paid with stolen, and has
given the cops the numbers of
the notes ; he then sets out with
gelid determination to wipe-
out his double-crosser, taking
as hostage during his operations
the fiancee of a detective-
sergeant who is leading the
chase after him.

panion, tries to find out what
makes a conscienceless killer

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Clyde Industries, Ltd.
AN uncertain performer in its earlier
years, Clyde Industries, Ltd., has
achieved considerable success in the post-
war period, during which a broadening of
activities has placed the co.’s 60-year-old
business on a much sounder basis than
that enjoyed previously. This policy of
diversification is continuing, and the co.
is currently developing a number of new
lines.
As in the past, the task of securing a
steady flow of orders for steam, and now
diesel, locomotives remains something of
a problem, but, by stretching the range
of light- and heavy-engineering products
sold on local and export. markets and
branching-out into the merchandising of
allied lines, the Clyde group has now
obtained a degree of protection against
sectional variations in trading conditions.
A holding co., Clyde Industries has
accumulated a moderately large family
of subsidiaries over the past decade —
mainly by the exchange of scrip—the
group operating plants in Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Adelaide.
The major subsidiaries are:
Clyde Engineering Co. Pty. (heavy
engineers and bridge-builders, manufac-
turers of locomotives, rolling-stock, omni-
buses, boilers, mining-machinery, etc.).
Clyde Batteries Pty. (lead-acid bat-
teries).
Paul and . Gray Pty. (ship-chandlers,
merchants).
A. C. Willard and Co. Pty. (processing--
plant for food, chemical and textile indus-
tries, stainless-steel products).
John Carruthers and Co. Pty. (con-
sulting-engineers, agents, manufacturers of
mechanical and electrical plant).
Martin and King Industries, Ltd.
(railway rolling-stock, motor-vehicle bodies,
assembly of Volkswagen vehicles).
Apac Industries, Ltd. (automotive
jacks, greasing equipment, fork-lift trucks,
etc.).
Spreading into yet another field, the co.
acquired a controlling-interest in the
plywood-manufacturer and -distributor,
Proofwood, Ltd., early in the current
term.
, The parent co. has a paid capital of
£2,581,918 (of which £300,000 is in 5 p.c.
first prefs. and a like amount in 5 p.c.
second prefs.), the last request to share-
holders for additional share-capital
occurring in 1952. Bonus scrip was sent
out in 1954 (one-for-five) and in 1955
(one-for-eight).
Following a new peak in earnings, the
ord. div.-rate, steady at 10 p.c. since 1951,
was lifted to 12i p.c. last term to give an
average rate of 9.3 p.c. for the past 10
years.
Orders, both local and export, for
diesel locomotives have for some time
been limited by the inadequate finance
available to potential purchasers and, with
strong competition from rival manufac-
turers, the co., once again, found diffi-
culty last term in keeping production of
locomotives up to economic levels. How-
ever, advances in other directions, not-
ably in the sale of batteries, food-process-
ing plant and railway rolling-stock, and
the strong demand for Volkswagen
vehicles, gave the group as a whole its
highest profit on record, net earnings
rising by £59,096 to £462,639 after setting
aside £379,489 (up £87,970) for taxation
and £256,847 (up £37,622) for
depreciation:

Working-capital improved by £264,155
to £2,041,456, the proportion of
outside money to the total funds
employed- in the business dropping
from 46.8 p.c. to 42.4 p.c. Certain of the
co.’s freeholds were revalued in 1951 and
in 1957, fixed assets being shown at cost
or valuation less depreciation.
Proposed alterations to the articles of
association, designed to regulate the
voting-rights attaching to scrip held by
unit trusts, were challenged by Australian
Fixed Trusts Pty., and others, in 1956.
The dispute was brought before the
N.S.W. Equity Court later that year, but
the court’s decision in the matter is not
expected to be made known before next
March or April.
Seasonal conditions and the state of
railway finances may restrict some of the
group’s activities in the current term, but
the expansion of other interests should
ensure a successful year.
Consolidated accounts (June 30, 1957)
show a net tangible backing of 325. for

Queensland Brewery, Ltd.
"IvrEITHER of Queensland’s two major
brewers appears to have been
troubled overmuch by the 37 p.c. increase
in the excise-duty on beer included in the
“little” Budget of March, 1956. Both
cos. improved their earnings last year,
Castlemaine Perkins, Ltd., maintaining,
with ease, a 10 p.c! div.-rate on a bonus-
enlarged capital, while Queensland
Brewery, Ltd., finished the year to June
30 with a 28.9 p.c. increase in net profit.
Although it has halted the growth in
beer-consumption, the higher duty has
not brought about any significant decline
in output, and, at 226-million gallons,
the Australian production of beer over
the last financial year was less than 0.5
p.c. below the record total for 1955-56.
Equal to 13.8 gallons per head of popu-
lation in 1945-46, beer-consumption last
year reached an estimated 22.9 gallons
per head.
To meet this big increase in demand,
and to secure its share of the trade,
Queensland Brewery has spent heavily on
plant and freeholds over the last six years,
enlarging its two breweries, at Brisbane
and Toowoomba, and, at the same time,
extending and modernising the chain of
co.-owned hotels.
As a result, the book-value of fixed
assets has doubled since 1951, a large
proportion of the additional funds
required being provided by shareholders.
The most recent issue, three-for-eight, at
par, was made early last term, and lifted
paid capital to £2,375,000, of which
£199,234 is in 5£ p.c. prefs. and the
balance in £1 ords. No date has been set
for future calls on the new scrip at present
paid to 10s.
Still iiu progress at the end of last
term, extensions to both the Brisbane
and Toowoomba breweries enabled a
greater output of draught-beer over the
year to June 30 last, and, although the co.
experienced a “slight recession in trade”
in the early part of the term, turnover
(undisclosed) appears to have improved
considerably in subsequent months.
Calculated after providing unstated
amounts for taxation and contingencies
and £131,698 (down £1844) for deprecia-
tion, net profit jumped by £60,229 to
£267,524, covering the pref. div. and 12.7
p.c. on average ord. capital, as against
10.9, 12.3, 12.5 and 10.6 p.c. in the four
years back to 1953:

As the co. was employing a larger share-
capital for seven months of the year, the


improvement in the earning-rate is an
encouraging sign, particularly when it is
remembered that the expansion pro-
gramme was not completed until the
current term.
Raised from 7 p.c. to 8 p.c. in 1954, the
ord. div.-rate has since been maintained
at that level, and, with the pref. commit-
ment, would call for £185,014 in the
current term, or £82,510 less than last
term's effort.
Shown at cost, less depreciation, plant,
breweries, freehold-hotels, etc., are
lumped together in the published accounts
at £3,685,855, expenditure on fixed assets
over the term exceeding £540,000:

Current liabilities, “including provisions,”
were £294,420 greater than current
assets at balance-date, but just how much
was tied-up in provisions is not made
clear. In any case, with capital-expendi-
ture past its peak and £375,000 of un-
called capital in reserve, finances don’t
appear to be causing the board any
concern.
Hoping to see a higher div.-rate in the
not-too-distant future, the sharemarket
prices the f.-p. £1 ords. at 295. 3d. for a
yield of £5 9s. sd. p.c. from the current
8 p.c. rate, the contribs., paid to 10s.,
looking a little cheaper at 16s. 3d. The
£1 prefs., which give holders the right to
participate in new issues, last sold at

Including uncalled capital the ords. had
a net tangible cover of 28s. at June 30

United Provisions, Ltd.
of the largest organisations of
its kind in Australia, United Pro-
visions, Ltd., has, for various reasons,
proved an erratic profit-winner ever since
it was formed, in 1927, to amalgamate*
the interests of Foggit Jones, Ltd., and
J. C. Hutton Pty.
Primarily a ham- and bacon-curer,
meat-canner and smallgoods-manufac-
turer, United Provisions, through its three
wholly-owned subsidiaries, also handles
and processes frozen meat, butter, cheese,
margarine, honey and poultry. A sub-
stantial exporter, the group supplies local
and overseas markets from 17 freehold
factories, 12 of which are in Australia
and the remainder in New Zealand.
Changes in overseas conditions and
demand, seasonal fluctuations in the
supply and cost of livestock, cutthroat
competition and the impact of internal
inflation on the co.’s export trade have
all, at various times, contributed to an
uneven earning-rate, while the high price
originally paid (in scrip) for the operating
cos. has helped to keep the ord. div .-rate
down to a maximum of 8 p.c. and the
average rate for the past decade to 5.8 p.c.
Pref. shares carrying a cumulative 8
p.c. account for £450,000 of the parent’s
£1,400,000 paid capital (unchanged since
formation), f.-p. £1 ords. making up the
balance.
Presented in an attractive and informa-
tive fashion, the latest accounts show a
continued improvement in group turnover,
which, at- £10,700,000 last term, was
£1,392,000 higher than the total for. the
previous term and approximately 30 p.c.
above the figure recorded in 1953. (One
subsidiaxy balances on March 31, the
other two on June 30, and the parent on
September 30.)
The co. received little benefit, however,
from the increase in sales, competition
limiting price-adjustments, while higher
material- and labor-costs cut into profit-
margins, and the improvement in net
earnings, £13,449 stronger at £135,812,
was more than accounted for by the
smaller provisions for tax (£81,767, down
£7964) and depreciation (£81,864, down
£7464):

The ord. div.-rate was unchanged at 8 p.c.,
earnings covering the pref. div. and 10.5
p.c. on ord. capital, as against 9, 17.4,
1.4 and 5.3 p.c. over the four years back
to 1953.
Since the co. set out, five years ago, to
re-equip its factories and modernise pro-
duction procedures, approximately
£970,000 has been spent on buildings and
plant and a further “considerable sum”
on motor-vehicles.
As the level of earnings has limited the
amount available for reinvestment in the
business, as well as making the raising
of fresh share- or loan-capital inadvisable,
the board has financed much of this
expenditure by the sale of assets surplus
to immediate requirements. Over the past
six years capital-profits arising from these
transactions have amounted to £402,965.
It would appear, however, that this source
of funds has been exhausted, and future
development will be regulated by the
trading-profit available to the co.
Last term a net £113,995 was added to
the valuation or cost-Zess-depreciation
book-value of fixed assets. Most of the
Australian freeholds were revalued in
1956:

By drawing on the bank for an extra
£341,422 it was possible to finance the
capital-outlay and, at the same time,
reduce the indebtedness to creditors by
£218,955. In a slightly more liquid form
at the end of the term, working-capital
fell by £76,762 to £423,267 over the year.
New plant-installations may help to
counter rising costs in the current term,
but trading conditions are unlikely to be
any more favorable than they were last
term. Near-drought conditions have
affected the supply and price of livestock
and other basic requirements in recent
months, and competition in the export
field, especially from Argentinian pro-
ducers, shows no sign of diminishing.

manipulation of

competitors, especially Volkswagen and
Holden, the expiry of the Austin assembly-
contract —such are the causative factors
to which can be attributed A.G.l.’s out-
size £98,212 trading-loss last term. The
group has been left stranded on its own
highwater-mark, stable financially since
last year’s heavy stock-reductions, but
overcapitalised and burdened with deben-
ture interest-payments, amounting to
£65,277 last term.
Largely dependent, since formation in
1953, on the sales of Austin cars and
commercial vehicles, for which the sub-
sidiary, Austin Distributors Pty., holds
the Victorian franchise, the co. (formerly
Ausdis Holding, Ltd.) has seen its share
of the shrinking automotive market
dwindle, wit,h the decline in turnover
further aggravated by narrowed profit-
margins. From a peak of nearly 10,000
units sold in Victoria in 1950-51, the
market last term could absorb only 4284
units, with pre-tax earnings from this
quarter showing a reduction of £230,000
on the previous term.

Victorian figures have reacted
similarly, combined registra-
tions for the years ended Dec.
31 being 4066, 4357, 6385 and
5332 back to 1954.
To offset the transfer of the
Austin assembling side' of the
business to British Motor
Corporation’s Sydney plant,
completed in Dec., 1956, the
offshoot, Northern Engineering
Pty., had already in 1955 turned
its attention to the newly
negotiated Simca concession,
covering the Commonwealth.
Marketed through another
group - member, Continental
and General Distributors Pty.,
the Aronde and the Vedette have
so far yielded rather disappoint-
ing results from the profit
angle, heavy losses being
incurred last term when prices
had to be slashed to clear
accumulated stocks.
As a result, drastic economies
have had to be effected in
respect of both these offshoots.
The Queensland Simca
franchise was transferred,
together with retailing
facilities in that State, while in
the current term the North Mel-
bourne assembly-plant has
been sold to the Victorian
Government for £379,000, and
smaller premises acquired to
handle the scaled - down
activities.
A third operator to add its
contribution to the group-loss
was Howard Auto-Cultivators
Pty., the farm-appliance manu-
facturer, which was caught
between the Supplementary
Budget squeeze of 1956 and the
adverse weather conditions pre-
vailing during the first half of
the term. Current prospects
seem little brighter.
Some relief to an
lugubrious picture was pro-
vided by the group’s hire-
purchase financier, Aus d i s
Finance Pty., which was able
to show good results with the
limited funds at its disposal.
A reorientation in this direction
as unprofitable investments are
realised seems to offer a partial
solution to the co.’s difficulties.
Upshot of the year’s trading
was an overall turnover of
nearly £9 million, including
sales on hire-purchase, a drop
of something over £1 million
on 1956. The net loss, £98,212,
was calculated after providing
£23,936 (down £10,586) for
depreciation on fixed assets,
£4745 for amortisation of lease-
hold improvements, £ll5O for
co.-tax and £ 12,550 for directors’
superannuation and retiring
allowances. On top of this
£45,000 had to be set aside as a
long-service provision, while
reserves were also depleted by
a loss on sale of assets of

Reliance Industries (Aust.)
/JETTING away to a ragged

•—this manufacturer of concrete
tiles and cement products gave
shareholders some encourage-
ment in the 1956 term by way
of a maiden dividend of 8 p.c.,
followed up by a 10 p.c. hand-
out last year.
Though the directors say that
“current trading conditions are
Very satisfactory and it is felt
that no difficulty will be
experienced in maintaining a
dividend-payment at this rate,”
more attention might be given
to reserve-building at present.
Sited at Yennora (N.S.W.),
Reliance Industries, which was
formed in November, 1951,
with a subscribed capital of
£65,000, fabricates concrete
tiles by the Pegson semi-auto-
matic process. Another facet
of the co.’s activities is the
distribution through an
associate, Reliance Sales and
Service Pty., of its ready-
mixed concrete products, with
particular attention to the do-
it-yourself householder.
Last year’s net profit, £16,831
(up £2737), was claimed after
deducting £4104 for deprecia-
tion and providing £9200 for
company-tax; £BOOO went to
shareholders, and £BB3l
remained for reserves or to
reduce intangibles (now £4000).
At last balance-date the
liquid position was fairly tight,
but it has been improving, and
if surplus earnings continue to
accumulate at the rate set by
profit-making over the past two
years, it should gradually
become easier:

Hill 50 Gold Mine, N.L.
A DECLINE in the grade of
ore available to Hill 50
Gold. Mine, an overestimation
of ore reserves included in the
annual report, last term’s
increase in paid capital (from
£150,000 to £450,000) and un-
certainty as to future div.-policy
have all tended to unsettle the
market for Hill 50 scrip.
The drop in values, the most
significant of these factors,
should be partly offset by
extensions to plant and a
vigorous development pro-
gramme which are expected to
lift the rate of throughput by
25 p.c. over the current term.
Although the higher ore-pro-
duction may not prevent a small
reduction in earnings, the Hill
50 mine (Mt. Magnet, W.A.)
still looks like remaining one
of the most profitable gold-
mining ventures in the country
for some time yet.
During the year to June 30
last the co. treated 124,155
tons (up 5533 tons) of ore for
87,2040 z. fine gold (up
39090 z.), which r e a 1 i s ed

ciation, net earnings were

To conserve funds, needed
for development, the board cut
this month’s quarterly interim

no indication of future div.-

Originally estimated to total
843,000 tons at July 9 last, ore
reserves at that date were later
re-estimated at 758,000 tons.
The quantity of proved and
probable ore on November 13,
1957, was calculated at 713,000

At the higher rate of through-

the mill busy for a little under
five years.
Cash, bonds and deposits

In the four weeks to

Report from Wellington on—
N.Z. Currency Crisis
ON December 12, the day on
which N.Z.’s new Labor
Government took office, the
Minister of Finance, Mr. Nord-
meyer, received from the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, Mr.
Greensmith, a confidential
report stating that the country’s
economic situation had deteri-
orated rapidly and to 3. serious
extent since the middle of
1957.
Mr. Greensmith recom-
mended immediate import-cuts
to save at least £3O million of
overseas exchange in 1958.
That reduction, he said,
would be necessary to restore
equilibrium in the balance-of-
payments without adding
anything to reserves. (The
Government says that a £3O-
- saving is expected as
a result of the cuts it imposed
on January 1.)
Mr. Greensmith estimated a
balance-of-payments deficit of
£24.7 million for the year
1957. Final figures, however,
show that the actual deficit
was £32.2 million. (All figures
in N.Z. currency.)
Overseas reserves are still
falling. Between June and
December they fell from £ll3
million to £45.5 million. By
the middle of January they
were down to £42.5 million,
compared with £7B million in
January, 1957, and £65.9
million in January, 1956.
This continued decline
occurred in spite of some
bolstering-up of the funds as a
result of the sale by the Reserve
Bank of £B.B million of sterling
investments between December
18 and January 15.
Higher Import Prices
WHAT caused the balance-
of-payments crisis? The
critical factor, according to
Mr. Greensmith, was a sharply
adverse movement in terms of
trade. > - c
For the final six months of
1957 private imports averaged
nearly £5 million a month
above the comparable figure
for 1956. While there was
some increase in the volume of
imports, the greater part of the
rise in payments came from
higher prices for imported
goods. Meantime prices for
exports, notably dairy produce,
Were declining.
Concessions in taxation, both
actual and prospective, a con-
tinued high demand for labor
with steadily rising wage-levels,
and also some relaxation of
monetary policies, resulted in
a level of demand for both con-
sumption and investment goods
at current price-levels greater
than the country could afford
from current earnings, said
Mr. Greensmith.
Since they took office Labor
politicians have been busy
blaming the past Government
for N.Z.’s plight. “We didn’t
know how bad things were,”
has been the burden of their
cry.
Well, they should have
known. There were plenty of
warnings. The president of the
Federation of Labor, F. P.
Walsh, himself on November
14 said that N.Z. was heading
for a “serious crisis over
balance - of - payments.” He
went on to criticise the
National Party’s inflationary
election promises, but omitted
to mention Labor’s even more
extravagant policy.
In spite of Mr. Walsh’s
warning and repeated warnings
also from other sources, includ-
ing the then Minister of
Finance, Mr. Watts, Mr. Nash
went to the polls on November
30 promising a £lOO tax-rebate
this month, an increase in. the
child, benefit from 10s. to 15s.
a week and a number of other
things, all of them obviously
contra-indicated by the state of
the country’s finances.
Inflation or Taxation?
MR. GREENSMITH h a s
pointed out that a £3O-
- reduction in imports, if
not accompanied by a similar
reduction in internal purchas-
ing-power, will cause strong
inflationary pressures to break
through in sharp price-in-
creases, which in turn will in-
crease costs through further
wage-rises.
As the most effective
methods of reducing purchas-
ing-power he has suggested
higher taxation and curtailment
of Government spending.
. Higher taxation —when the
Government is in the process
of obtaining legislative autho-
rity to rebate £l9 million!
Reduced Government spending
—when the Government has
just promised to pay an extra
ss. a week for every child in
the country!
It is clear that internal
spending will have to be
reduced. But this was clear
long before the election. It
should have been clear to the
last Government, which is
blameworthy for not having
taken appropriate action. And
it should have been clear to
Mr. Nash at the time when he
was seeking election with pro-
mises which could only have
the effect of increasing
spending.
He certainly knew on Decem-
ber 12, yet he waited till
January 1 before taking any
action. During that time im-
porting continued gaily, and
there was also some direct
flight of capital from the
country.
“Insurance” by Importers?
MR. GREENSMITH says
there is not much
evidence to suggest that the
increase in private imports in
recent months was an “insur-
ance” by importers against re-
imposition of import-control
after the elections.
This opinion is seriously
open to question. It was
widely believed that Labor
would win the election and that
import-control would follow.
In the circumstances it seems
certain that importers acted to
protect their interests.. This
view is supported by the fact
that the final figure for private
imports for 1957 at £268
million is £8 million higher
than Mr. Greensmith’s estimate
on December 12.
The Government is looking
to N.Z. manufacturers to fill
the gap caused by curtailment
of imports. To the extent that
they are able to do so, inflation-
ary pressure will, of course, be
reduced.
“But under present conditions
of full employment it would be
unwise to assume that local
production could make a
substantial contribution to
replacing goods restricted
under an import-licensing
arrangement,” Mr. Greensmith
says.
The Industries and Com-
merce Department disagrees.
According to its Minister, Mr.
Holloway, it is “confident that
a large amount of the slack
caused by import-restrictions
can be taken up by local
production.”
Time will tell; but reason
seems to be on Mr. Green-
smith’s side. Labor is already
fully employed. (Workers dis-
missed from motor-assembly
plants as a first result of
import-cuts will certainly be
quickly absorbed in other in-
dustries.) In addition there is
the problem of supplies of raw
materials and capital-equip-
ment. These items comprise 80
per cent, of imports, and the
Government admits that it has
had to cut them.
There seems little doubt that
N.Z. is in for another period of
austerity with shortages of
many goods. In fact, as Mr.
Greensmith says, “a lower
standard of living must be
accepted.”
The lesson of all this seems
plain: If New Zealanders
desire to enjoy a rising
standard-of-living and at the
same time carry out the
development works necessary
to provide for a growing popu-
lation, they must either learn
to produce more or they must
borrow more overseas. An
extra four hours’ of work a
week at ordinary (not penal
overtime) rates of pay would
go a long way toward over-
coming the country’s problems.
But that is not a solution
which seems likely to commend
itself to many.
The present crisis has drawn
attention once again to N.Z.’s
foolish and shortsighted refusal
to join the International Mone-
tary Fund and the World Bank.
The bank was established for
the very purpose of lending
funds for the development of
countries such as N.Z. Another
of its functions is to provide
short-term loans to ease tem-
porary balance-of-payments
difficulties. N.Z. could well do
with that assistance now.
1957 Exchange Figures
NEW ZEALAND’S overseas
exchange transactions for
1957, published on January 27,
show a deficit of £32.2 million,
compared with a surplus of
£8.9 million in 1956 and a
deficit of £26.5 million in
1955.
Export receipts, at £284.4
million, increased by only 1 per
cent., compared with increases
of 11 per cent, in 1956, and 14
per cent, in 1955. Capital
receipts fell from £l7 million
to £13.1 million, including £6.7
million Government.
Private imports increased by
16.7 per cent, to £268.1 million.
In the second half of the year
the monthly average rate rose
to £24.7 million, compared with
£2O million in the first half of
the year and £19.8 million in
the second half of 1956.


At Great Expense
By SADIE
my dear, I got
I it at great expense.”
J. Roy placed the
clothes-wringer on the
floor and untied the string and
paper wrapped around it.
Ella smiled warmly and
thanked him.
“I told you they were
expensive,” she said.
When he adjusted the handle
and screwed on the tension-
holds, he said: “It will save
your hands.”
She kissed him.
“Shall I open the beer?” she
asked.
“Good idea.” He hadn’t
looked at her all this time.
There was an unspoken ten-
sion between them.
During the drive to her flat,
after he had picked her up at
her office, they had talked care-
fully and politely.
He had been going to a party
that night, but for the first time
Ella objected. Usually she was
submissive and accepted every-
thing.
“Parties usually fall on a
Friday night at this time of the
year,” he had said when he
phoned her. “I’m expected to
go. . . I can’t very well get out
of it. I’ll drive you home and
stay for an hour or two.”
Ella thought of the Christmas
she would spend alone in her
flat.
“Why bother to come at all?”
she snapped.
He laughed gently. “I want
to see you. We can have a beer
or two.”
But she had persisted. She
had been having a trying day in
the office.
“If you knew you were
going, to this party why didn’t
you ring earlier? There are
other nights in the week.”
“Things are not too good at
home.”
That silenced her. After a
pause she said: “Where is the
party?”
“Oh, it’s just a staff affair.
It will be a bunfight, but I have
to put in an appearance, you
know.”
All docility again, she agreed
to the arrangement. He would
call for her about 5.30 at the
office.
That had been Thursday.
■fc/fOONING around her flat
that night, Ella thought
about other Friday nights and
other excuses. He was on a
committee for another party.
Things were not too good at
home. He was having visitors.
There was a period when he
merely came to her flat for
dinner and they never went out
at all. She had put up with
it because he hadn’t been well,
but it went on for so long that
she finally broke down and had
a nervous collapse. After that
he took her out for a meal and
a show in the suburb where she
lived.
She felt a stab under her left
shoulderblade. She knew it
was indigestion, but she also
knew what caused it.
She was going to look back
over those long years of Friday
nights; the pleasures, the
miseries, the reconciliations and
triumphs. When he was in her
arms he was hers alone. But
he always had to go back.
At eleven-o’clock he began
to look at the time ; she kept
her eyes closed until he moved
his arm away from her neck
and stretched. She always knew
what he was going to say, but
she waited until he said it was
getting late. He had a long
way to drive and it would be
midnight before he got home.
Then she sat passively while
he dressed.
While he dressed they talked.
Sometimes they even got on to
politics and current affairs.
President Eisenhower’s illness.
Churchill’s inexhaustible energy
and flair for writing history.
It always stopped when he
picked up his hat, and then she
walked to the door with him.
He said good-night and kissed
her. After that she went into
the kitchen for the milk-bottle
and a shilling from her purse
and put them out on the door-
step.
Then there were the days in
between while she waited for
the telephone to ring.
Once he told her he would
call on Saturday and take her
to some friends of his, and she
was so delighted she raced into
town in the morning and
bought a pair of shoes to go
with a new dress she had made.
He arrived at midday, and
they drove miles away to a
remote seaside residential-area
where his friends lived. By this
time she was so sick with
excitement that after a few
drinks with his friends she
became violently ill and had to
rest all the afternoon.
It hadn’t happened again.
TN the first year of being
together, they had gone to
all the shows in town. Dinners
at the best restaurants. It had
been two nights, then. Tuesday
and Friday. Life was wonder-
ful. They saw ballets because
she loved them, concerts and
plays. But he always had to
go back.
When she first met him at
a party he made straight for
her and they fell in love
ducks take to water.
It was something of a shock
when her best girl-friend told
her he was married. Although
in her heart she knew he must
have been. He was forty. It
had not made any difference.
He wanted her so badly and
she wanted him so badly. She
was thirty-four.
It had not always been easy.
She felt the humiliation of her
position”. When she saw him
preening himself, for he was
vain, she said something clever
and cutting. Sometimes he saw
someone he knew and, with a
hurried whisper to her, darted
away, leaving her standing, and
at a loss, a fear in her heart.
They met again, of course, a
few blocks away, he with tender
apologies, she in pain but with
acceptance. Those were
drugged nights.
There were times when she
felt she must leave him. Once
or twice she bade him goodbye
but before the week was out
she had telephoned, and they
acted as though nothing had
happened.
They rarely referred to Her.
She didn’t want to remember,
and he didn’t want to remind
her, of Something In Between.
Then She became ill. He had
to shorten his visits and
gradually they slipped into a
sort of humdrum existence but
still with a mystic madness that
made them cling to each other
because they saw the reflection
of stars in each other’s eyes.
Because things were not good
At Home she faced lonely
nights when he would have
been with her. She never
dreamed of enjoying herself
elsewhere, and anyway the
years were passing and the
friends she had known had
slipped away.
T ATER, his visits became
more regular, although
there was a dull uniformity
about it now. He bought her
fruit and vegetables when they
didn’t go to a show, and some-
times he left very early.
She did not argue when the
excuses first started. Then,
she studied her face to see if
age was showing, but life was
still kind. Few people knew
she was forty-five.
While he was dressing one
night, she yawned and said:
“I have to do the washing in
the morning, blast it. I wish
I had a clothes-wringer. Wring-
ing out the sheets makes my
hands ache.”
“I’ll buy you one for Christ-
mas,” he had answered as he
picked up his hat.
“They’re expensive,” she
warned him. “That’s why I
haven’t bought one.”
After that his social engage-
ments started. It was nearing
Christmas. Her holidays were
long overdue and she was feel-
ing jaded. Why should she be
the one to be left out always?
He didn’t really consider her.
It would jolly well serve him
right if she telephoned his firm
in the morning to find out
about the party. That would
scare him. They knew nothing
about her, and he didn’t want
them to know.
A STING of excitement
swept through her, and
was still there on Friday morn-
ing.
When she was in her office
she picked up the telephone
and dialled his number. With
mounting bravado she asked
for the name of the place where
the party was to be held and
the directions for reaching it.
She told them who she was.
She had no intention of going.
When Roy arrived that even-
ing to drive her home they
were polite and spoke care-
fully to each other. They did
not mention the party. As they
neared the suburb where she
lived he asked what was on at
the local picture-show.
“Aren’t you going to the
party?” she asked.
“It won’t be • worth the
effort,” he said ; and they left
it at that.
She saw that he was carrying
a parcel when they entered the
flat.
He put it on the floor and
said: “There, my dear, I got it
at great expense.”
She knew what it was.
She was humbled and very
grateful.

The Man on
the Handkerchief
By A. B. SHERLOCK
(9)
fin America, Griffo, former
“king” of The Rocks’ push in
Sydney, has met and performed
brilliantly against the world s best,
but now l has just been defeated by
Gans in what is Griffo’s last big
tight. The present instalment
rounds off the last years of his
fantastic career.}
Griffo was in his
thirtieth year, an age at
which most fighters, in
the lighter divisions any-
way, have hung up their gloves.
The Gans defeat, the only
decisive win ever scored against
him, had exposed the holes and
rust in his armor ; he was ready
to retire.
A further discouragement
was the current slump in the
boxing game in America.
Authorities in State after State
were banning glove contests.
Griffo drifted off disconso-
lately to Chicago, but some-
thing vital had gone out of him.
In March, 1901, he invaded
several levee saloons, perhaps
smouldering under some sense
of grievance; he announced
that it was his mission to “close
all joints.”
His reforming zeal resulted
only in the smashing of a few
glasses; Griffo was strangely
subdued. In jail he confessed
his perplexity to an inter-
viewer : “I can’t work, and I am
through with fighting. So I
don't know what to do with
myself.”
As it happened, he was not
yet finished with fighting, but
after his defeat by Gans, any
contests of his Ihat got into
the record-books were prac-
tically annual events. Towards
the end of 1901 he beat Jim
Popp at New York, six rounds,
and Kid Ashe in 10 rounds at
Cincinnati.
Then for nearly a year he was
not heard of until he drew with
Joe Bernstein at Baltimore in
six rounds. At the same place,
in 1903, he knocked-out Jack
Bain in eight rounds, and the
next year drew with George
Memsic at Chicago in six
rounds.
But he was slipping into
obscurity, and his eccentricities
lost news-value.
©NE or two anecdotes have
been handed down. The
story goes that Griffo was taken
South for a contest, but with
both men in the ring, gloved
and ready, a pair of policemen
walked to the ringside and
appeared interested in making
arrests if anything resembling a
prize-fight developed.
The two boxers, bending,
stretching and high-footing it
about the ring, staged a hastily-
organised gymnastic display.
Still the Law lingered.
This bloodless ballet bored
the spectators, and they became
very restless. One of them let
fly with an empty bottle. It
missed the officers by several
feet, but hit the timekeeper’s
gong with a cheerful clang. At
once Griffo and his opponent,
like well-trained soldiers, went
into action.
According to report, the
policemen became too fasci-
nated to arrest anyone.
Also from the South comes
the yam of Griffo’s advance-
billing as Punch-dodger Extra-
ordinary, Slippery Sam, and
Ring Will - o’ - the - Wisp. The
locals crowded to see the
renowned slip-tease artist, not
knowing that Griffo often
behaved like the capricious dog
who will not do his tricks today.
He heard what was expected
of him, and decided that the
situation called for bare feet.
This was conceded, but he
further insisted on having his
feet blackened and polished—
a juvenile touch which never
lost its appeal for Griffo. He
got into the ring, and floundered
about amateurishly. His
opponent, Dixie Diamond, an
eager youngster, found to his
delight that he could land on
the great boxer with practically
every punch.
This moved one of his
supporters to a metallic bellow:
“Heck, he just can’t miss!”
Nobody noticed that Griffo
was taking all these hits on the
sides and top of his rock-bound
skull. He wore a silly-comedy
grin and put on a brilliant
display of ineptitude. His
sponsors watched in deepening
embarrassment, and the crowd
roared encouragement for the
home-town fighter.
“He can’t miss, he can’t
miss!” shouted the man with
the brass-plated throat. “Haitit
missed one yet!"
By the start of the fifth
round, Dixie Diamond had
discharged several hundreds of
punches, and he was almost
exhausted. His deliveries came
slower and slower; he had
trouble in raising his arms.
Griffo suddenly moved in and
landed an authentic left hook
which sprawled Dixie on his
back. He didn’t get up. Griffo
leered across the ropes at the
noisy barracker.
“Blimey—never missed that
one neither!”
THIS was a long way from
the limelight. Griffo had
no future as a fighter, and his
past was a crumbling asset.
Amongst the featherweights,
Dixon was still up with the best,
but public favor beamed now
on McGovern, Young Corbett,
Abe Attell and Harlem Tommy
Murphy. The news of the day
was strung around these names,
and Griffo as a public hero
was finished.
But if the personage was no
more, the man continued to
exist. He lived on for more
than another quarter of a
century, easily outlasting his old
enemies Dixon and Gans;
Dixon, a shell hollowed out
with fighting and dissipation,
died in 1909, followed a year
later by Gans, whom consump-
tion finished off.
Griffo, not yet forty, and
distinctly corpulent with
middle-age, did not look in
any way moribund. The
dancing featherweight of
twenty years before was now a
beefy barrel of a man, a slow
and sedentary enlargement of
his former self.
He had come to anchor in
New York after drifting around
in obscure waters, and what-
ever his life had been in those
unreported years, he had sur-
vived somehow, and emerged
fat, smiling and unambitious,
to become one of the show-
pieces of the metropolis as he
sat, day after day, on a step
between tw*> picture-houses
hard by Broadway.
Retired he might be, but
still by no means retiring. He
had lived his active life in the
public gaze, and, superfluous or
not, he lagged on the stage
from habit and inclination.
Somewhere along the line he
had given up his dedication to
drink. The roistering of his
young days, the boozy sky-
larking, had faded out in his
middle years. The usual descent
into the role of the abandoned
and hopeless soak he avoided
with one of those puzzling side-
steps characteristic of his
methods in the ring. It didn’t
happen to Griffo.
Instead, he contented him-
self with sitting and looking—
and receiving homage. Like
many retired celebrities, he
found himself becoming more
illustrious by sheer survival.
The longer he occupied his
appointed kerbside throne, the
more time-honored and interest-
ing he became, and the more of
the city’s millions paused at
his feet.
They paused sometimes out
of respect, sometimes from
mere curiosity, and again with
dry disapproval but they
paused, and Griffo was content.
“He would,” one observer
noticed, “accept 50 cents, an
apple, a cup of coffee, or a
pleasant time of the day, with
equal passiveness.”

Papermaking and Science go hand in hand...
There’s more to making paper than meets
the eye even the “eye” of the impressive
electron microscope used by the research staff
of A.P.M. Australian Paper Manufacturers
Limited.
Today, A.P.M.’s research scientists have at
their command many valuable instruments and
machines, plus the resources of three labora-
tories, a workshop and technical library.
In these laboratories the researchers face
the fascinating, never-ending problems of im-
proving paper and paper-making techniques;
of developing the many wood by-products; of
testing the qualities and composition of various
pulps.
Ahead lies the possibility of making paper
from materials other than wood; of improving
wood species; of continued investigation of
Australian forestry problems.
A.P.M. research scientists have a proud
record of achievement, including such tangible
results as their wartime development and pro-
duction of cellulose pulp for explosives, and
dissolving pulp from eucalypt wood for use
in rayon manufacture.
A.P.M.’s research programme means better
paper products for you and contributes greatly
to the economy and efficiency of A.P.M.’s
operations as Australia’s largest manufacturer
of wrapping paper and paperboard.*
*The term paperboard embraces cardboard,
fibreboard and other heavyweight papers.
Basically the same raw materials are used
for paperboard and paper.

POWER AND PROGRESS
NEWS that a team of British scientists
at Harwell, led by Australian Dr.
Thonemann, have “tamed the hydrogen-
bomb” to the extent of reaching, momen-
tarily, temperatures exceeding that of the
surface of the sun, has given some reality
to hopes that have been held ever since
the first splitting of the atom —that Man
may soon have at his disposal a virtually
inexhaustible source of power.
The raw-material of the thermonuclear
power-plants now envisaged is sea-water,
and it is calculated that heavy-hydrogen
contained in a gallon of it will ultimately
give us the equivalent energy of two tons
of coal.
The pfospect held out by this proposi-
tion is certainly alluring. Nuclear-
scientists have no doubt of it, and no
one who believes that there is a future
for the human race can dare to disbelieve
it as the fossil-fuels, coal and oil, which
have so far made comfort and progress
possible on our planet, cannot continue
to do so for more than a brief period in
the way history measures time. Even
uranium, the raw material of the nuclear-
power stations at present in existence or
under construction, will not be able to
fill the gap for very long.
Sir John Cockcroft, director of the
U.K. Atomic Energy Research Station at
Harwell, thinks the work being done
there may mean the establishment of a
thermonuclear plant within 20 years.
Others place the target-date somewhat
later, and, of course, the day when the new
source of power will be harnessed for
general use is more remote still. For
immediate practical purposes unlimited
power from the sea is still a dream. For
that matter, even uranium-based nuclear
energy will play only a minor part in
supplying the world’s electrical power
needs in the next two decades, although
its contribution will be increasing rapidly
towards the end of that period.
A Huge Programme
"ORITAIN’S accelerated programme
-■-* for the construction of nuclear-
power stations is not being affected
by the new development. The
United Kingdom was ' the first
country to feed nuclear power into its
national grid and is already in a position
to export nuclear-power stations. Last
year plans were announced for trebling
the programme decided upon in 1955.
This will involve the building by 1965 of
19 plants with a total capacity of 5-6
million kilowatts, which is considerably
more than the total installed capacity of
all the power-stations at present opera-
ting in Australia.
The estimated cost of this vast plan,
plus the additions and extensions to coal-
and oil-fuelled power-stations that will
also be necessary during the period, has
been placed as high as £3350 million. A
programme of conventional power-plants
to give the same output by 1965 would
probably cost £650 million less, but the
w operating-costs of the nuclear plants are
expected to be much lower ; it is also
hoped that the costs of constructing them
will become progressively lower. In addi-
tion to this the nuclear plants will'save
18 million tons of coal a year.
By 1965, then, a sizeable portion of
Britain’s power-needs will be met by
nuclear plants, though more than four-
fifths will still be drawn from old-style
power-stations. Unless there are some
extraordinary developments the propor-
tion of orthodox generating-plants will be
much higher in other industrial countries
than in Britain. Threatened shortage of
fuel has been the driving force behind
atom-development in the United King-
dom, where the coal- and oil-resources
are not sufficient to permit the simul-
taneous expansion of the steel industry
and power-generation. In countries
greater coal-reserves the need for nuclear
development is not so urgent.
Industrial Strength
pLECTRICAL-POWER output is an
important index of industrial
strength. America, the greatest industrial
Power in the world, is also the country
with the greatest output of electricity,,
and Russia’s tremendous increase in in-
dustrial capacity in the past 30 years has
been accompanied by a corresponding
development in the building of power-
stations, without which the progress
would have been impossible.
The European Coal and Steel Com-
munity (West Germany, France, Belgium,
Holland, Italy and the Saar) estimates that
its electricity-requirements will be doubled
by 1965 and trebled by 1975. By the
latter date all the hydroelectric resources
of the area are expected to have been
fully harnessed. A small beginning will
have been made with nuclear energy, but
the great bulk of Europe’s power will
still come from stations fuelled by coal
and oil.
Australia’s Position
TN the year ended June 30, 1957, the
A generating-capacity of the main electri-
city-system of Australia increased by
457,560 kilowatts, bringing the total
capacity to 4,236,438 kilowatts. This com-
pares with 2,620,782 kilowatts in 1951-52
and 1,620,296 kilowatts in 1938-39, the
last year before World War IT forced a
reassessment of our industrial capacity.
How essential that expansion has been can
be realised by casting a thought back to
the early post-war years when blackouts
and power-rationing were part of the
general plan in most States.
In time, nuclear stations will no doubt
be part of the pattern in Australia, as
elsewhere, but in the two chief industrial
States there is no question of a fuel
shortage within the lifetime of power-
plants now in existence, or planned. At
the present time very considerable pOwer-
plants are under construction and many
more are projected. The Department of
the Interior’s Facts and Figures, No. 55
lists the principal projects to be completed
before the end of 1963. These will in-
crease the present installed capacity by
more than 50 per cent., a rate of increase
which compares favorably with that of
the European bloc.
Development
T ARGE power-stations at present under
construction in New South Wales
include Tallawarra, on the southern coal-
field (with a capacity of 2OO,0OOkw.),
Lake Macquarie, near Newcastle (230,000
kw.), and Wallerawang, on the western
field (210,000 kw.). Also under discussion
are two huge stations, each of 800,000
kw., for the northern coalfields. All these
are examples of the policy of siting the
power-stations at the coalfields and taking
the power by high-voltage transmission-
lines to the industrial areas.
Continuing its development of power
from brown-coal, Victoria is building a
340,000 kw. plant .at Yallourn and a
smaller one, with a capacity of 91,000 kw.,
at Morwell. On completion of these
works a new station will be commenced
at Hazelwood, near Morwell; its ultimate
capacity, to be reached in stages, will be
800,000 to a million kilowatts. Progress
in the other States is on a lesser scale,
but S.A. has plant aggregating 195,000
kw. under construction, Queensland’s new
stations, on the way or projected, will
have a capacity of 315,000 kw. and W.A.
is increasing the capacity of its 30,000 kw.
Bunbury plant to 120,000 kw,
Tasmanian power is mainly generated
by hydroelectric stations —extensions to
give a further 124,000 kw. are in course
of construction. Except in the south-
eastern corner of the continent, rivers on
the Australian mainland do not lend them-
selves to harnessing for power, but the
Tumut power-stations of the Snowy
Mountains Scheme will add 600,000 kw. to
the N.S.W.-Victorian electricity-systems
in the next few years and the ultimate
capacity of the whole scheme will be
something like 3 million kw. Minor
contributions to Australia’s power-pool
will be made by hydroelectric works
at Tuily (Q.), Kiewa (Vic.) and Hume and
Warragamba (N.S.W.).
When nuclear power comes to Aus-
tralia it is most likely to be tried out in
those parts where there is little or no
coal and no hydroelectric possibilities.
South Australia seems a natural field for
it, and Premier Playford has already
announced that his State will build no
more conventional stations after the
current programme is completed. It may
be, however, that western or northern
Queensland may beat him to it, with Mt.
Isa or Weipa the site of the first plant.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The Horses
Master Rane keeps on
winning. At the Australia Day
meeting at Moonee Valley the
colt won his sixth successive
race and lifted his stake earn-
ings to £4750. He has been up
since the spring and will be
kept in training for the im-
portant two-year-old events of
the autumn. Fred Hoysted is
following an unusual pro-
gramme with the colt’s training.
He does only light exercise on
the track, and maintains his
condition by continuous racing.
Even with such a preparation,
few horses could stand up to the
arduous campaign Master Rane
has endured so successfully.
The C. F. Orr Stakes has
been won by some pretty good
horses, but this year the race
was run as a handicap and
attracted only a moderate field.
Highfire, sent out a warm
favorite, justified his stable’s
confidence by winning very
easily from last year’s Epsom
winner, Timor. A three-year-
old bay colt, Highfire is raced
by his breeder, V.R.C. com-
mitteeman C. O. Fairbairn. He
is by Empyrean (whose stock
are having a wonderful season)
out of Macis by Zaimis from
The Mace. The Mace was also
the dam of that useful stayer
Sunworship, but Highfire is
essentially a sprinter. His
autumn programme includes
the Newmarket, in which, how-
ever, he will encounter much
stiffer opposition than he met
in the Orr Stakes.
Prior to his win in the mile-
and-a-half Malua Handicap at
Caulfield, Droll Prince was
considered a doubtful stayer ;
not from a breeding angle but
because he likes to run his
races in front. Indeed, he led
for every yard of the Malua.
He coasted home lengths clear
of the field and actually
finished fresher than any of
his opponents. The run was
impressive enough to earn him
a start in the Sydney Cup on
April 7. Breeding says the
Cup distance will not worry
Droll Prince. He is by Mel-
bourne Cup winner Comic
Court from Ismalia by Porto-
fino from Amalia by Amalfi.
Portofino sired 1942 Melbourne
Cup winner Colonus. Amalia
won the 1936 Australian Cup
and finished fourth in the Mel-
bourne Cup. Droll Prince is
raced in partnership by Sydney
businessman W. J. Bradshaw
and his daughter, Mrs. P.
Masoh.
• • • t
Having only his third start
in a race, Nilento won the six-
furlongs Sturt Handicap for
two-year-olds at Caulfield —
and left the impression that he
will develop into a galloper
above the ordinary. Although
drawn 24 at the barrier,
Nilento was always in touch
“What a small World —and remember when We used to
play the wag an ’ go bird-nestiri?”
with the leaders, and finished
full of running to win comfort-
ably. Sydney trainer Peter
Lawson bid 2250gns. for the
gelding on behalf of Melbourne
businessman R. A. Cappey,
who races Nilento in partner-
ship with his wife. By Nilo
from Posture, the gelding is a
full brother to the Sydney
galloper Count Olin and a
half-brother to The Corsican.
The going at Caulfield was very
heavy, and the manner in which
Nilento finished suggested that
he will win races over a bit
of ground. Certainly, Satur-
day’s success won’t be his last.
• • • '•
Bill Williamson could set
new figures for a Melbourne
jockey this season. The record
—which Williamson holds him-
self —is 67 winners. With six
months of this season to go
he has ridden 35 winners. At
Caulfield he completed yet
another double when he rode
the last winner, Quiberon, in
the Keysborough Welter. A
seven-year-old bay gelding by
the Midstream horse Wirralie,
out of Jaune, Quiberon
deserved a win. He had run
three minor placings prior to
Saturday’s success. Although
raced on lease by H. Robins,
Quiberon is owned by Ballarat
studmaster Ernie Craig. Early
last year Craig imported the
English horse Affreux to stand
at his stud and was later
delighted when Crepello won
the English Derby ; Affreux is
closely related to the classic
winner.
This year’s Wm. Reid Stakes
—run at Moonee Valley on the
Australia Day holiday—went
to Golden Doubles. It was
mentioned here a couple of
weeks ago that it was remark-
able to see Golden Doubles
racing again. The horse frac-
tured a sesamoid last autumn,
and few horses recover from
such an injury. His success in
the Wm. Reid was a tribute to
the patience of Wangaratta
trainer Hal Hoysted. However,
the race took its toll. Golden
Doubles was lame again after
his win, and it is most unlikely
that he will race again. A pity
—he has been one of Victoria’s
best gallopers over the past few
seasons, and was up to weight-
for-age standard.
• • • •
For the first time in Aus-
tralia, a telecast will be made
of a full day’s racing when the
Queen Mother visits Fleming-
ton on March 1. In granting
this privilege to all Melbourne
TV-stations, the V.R.C. has
stipulated that no advertise-
ments be connected with the
telecast.
• • t
Sydney’s brilliant sprinters
Dubbo and New Spec, racing
in top form, seem bound to
make it tough for Melbourne
and Adelaide speedsters in the
£2OOO Lightning Stakes, five
furlongs at Flemington on
Saturday next. The entry-list
of 28 may be considerably
pruned at acceptance-time—
the majority of the nominations
haven’t much chance of figuring
in the first three. Some weight-
for-age races, and this is one,
have produced three starters
only, even two, but the Light-
ning Stakes should be a real
drawcard with a top field in the
line-up and competition from
the various States. First money
is £l4OO, with £4OO for second,
and £2OO for third. New Spec,
a four-year-old, will carry 9.0 ;
and Dubbo, a three-year-old,
8.7. The former is selected to
win the sprint, which went to
his former stablemate, Gay
Vista, in 1955, and to another
Sydneysider, Apple Bay, in
1956. Last February Copper
Year was successful.
• • • •
Following their early summer
spell, four contenders for
autumn honors reappeared in
the Flying Handicap, six fur-
longs at Rosehill; They were
Landy, Ter any an, Prince
Darius and Grenoble. The first-
named pair were much above
themselves in condition,
though Ter any an was handy to
the lead in the early stages.
He finished 12th and Landy
10th. Both started at 66 to 1,
but it may not be long before
they figure at much shorter
odds in a race. Prince Darius
also looked slightly on the big
side, as did Grenoble, but they
were more forward in race con-
dition. Prince Darius was
heavily backed from 6 to 1 to 2-
to-1 favoritism, which seemed
not a little surprising. Grenoble
firmed from 20’s to 14’s, so he
must have had some admirers.
He came home fast in third
place, just ahead of Prince
Darius, who at 9st. had
his share of weight, and wasn’t
helped by the barrier draw, 19.
Though first out, he soon went
back in the field, dropping to
ninth position in the field of
16 at the half-mile. He then
moved up fast and was going
on strongly at the finish in
fourth place. Grenoble’s finish
was equally impressive, and
both horses should go well
when next produced. Grenoble
could be a long-range tip for
the A.J.C. Doncaster Handicap.
• • • •
Rosehill was in perfect order
following the January rains;
although there were about 300
points* of steady rain over the
track a day or so before the
fixture, the course proper was
only slightly holding. New
improvements included an
overhead covering for patrons


and bookmakers over the rails*
section of the betting-ring,
replacing the familiar large
umbrellas which are still
featured in other sections of the
ling, and the first opening of
the new public-stand, accom-
modating 2000 patrons between
the Paddock and the St. Leger
enclosures. It is not quite
finished. A new idea for this
stand is an attractive fish-and-
cyster bar which did good
business on the opening day.
The club’s caterer, Noel Eglese,
made arrangements for a quick
and efficient service ; one more
amenity of many installed by
S.T.C.’s executive.
With each meeting from now
until Sydney’s autumn racing
gets into full swing, top-class
horses will be seen in action
and their progress watched by
enthusiasts on the lookout for
likely winners of the A.J.C.
Doncaster Handicap and
Sydney Cup double. Canter-
bury Park patrons on Saturday
next may see Melbourne Cup
winner Straight Draw in his
first run since he landed the
two-miler. Straight Draw is
among those weighted for the
six-furlongs Flying Handicap,
but that distance is much too
short for this top stayer. How-
ever, it will assist his autumn
preparation. Most stayers are
given a sprint outing on resum-,
mg after a spell. Baystone is
another good stayer engaged in
the Flying. He also appears in
the Welter Handicap. In
earlier years top-class stayers,
even Melbourne Cup winners,
have come to light with a first-
up win over a sprint course.
Windbag did this at Warwick
Farm.

As forecast on this page (B.
15/l/’5B), speedy two-year-old
gelding The Wensum duly
made his first race-appearance
at Rosehill on Saturday last,
February 1, and acted right up
to his first barrier-trials in
September last and more recent
fast track-gallops at Randwick.
Such a boomed sprinter was
bound to start at short odds and
the ringmen took not the
slightest chance when they
opened him “in the red.” They
demanded odds of 5 to 2, which
didn’t suit small investors.
However, patrons of the tote
were returned 2 to 1 “on,”
which was best price. One
wager noted was £2250 to
£lOOO on, while several bets of
£9OO to £4OO on were set, so
for a brief period of about
67sec. quite a number of lead-
ing backers lifted, as it turned
out, an easy £4OO. The Wen-
sum is another of the Newtown
Wonder (imp.) speedsters. He
had to be taken from the A.J.C.
Breeders’ Plate shortly before
that race was run. However,
as Saturday’s race was only a
Graduation event, maybe The
Wensum will be fully tested
when he is placed in a field
of much better performers in
the two-year-old class.
Progeny of Genetout won the
final two races at Rosehill.
Charente, in the Welter Handi-
cap, made his winning sequence
three in three weeks, while
Thruster made his first appear-
ance on the winning list in the
Auburn Stakes. Genetout has
sired the winners of dozens of
races of all types, with best
horse Columnist (1947 Caul-
field Cup and Caulfield Stakes
winner). He also won the
Williamstown Cup that season
with 9.7. Genetout was success-
ful in France and in Belgium,
and in Australia won at
Warwick Farm and at Rosehill.
He has sired the winners of
upwards of a quarter of a
million pounds in stakes.
Well-fancied youngsters won
the divisions of the Doomben
Two-year-old Handicap at the
Brisbane Club’s latest fixture.
Camera Shy, winner of the first
division, is raced and trained by
G. Shelley, and is a Leica (imp.)
filly from Gallery Girl by John
James (imp.), while Second
Release, winner of the second
division, is a gelding by Justice
Jury (imp.) from Te Loch by
Balloch (imp.) from Te Parae
by Croupier. Second Release
comes from a winning family
which included High Caste. Te
Loch was a winner at
Doomben, Maiden company.
Second Release defeated the
even-money favorite, Stalag-
mite, trained by H. J. Reardon.
Reardon won the Rosehill First
Parramatta Stakes the same
afternoon with Glanceful, an
attractive four-year-old geld-
ing by Passing Glance (imp.)
from Second Thoughts. Glance-
ful was saddled by Rosebery
trainer Norman Brown.
“Sawtell”: What was
probably a unique double in
racing was completed at the
New Year meeting in Tumut
(N.S.W.), when three-year-old
Sir Belmore won the Improvers
Handicap. In the racebook, he
is shown as being sired by
Belvine, winner of the Flying,
the previous event on the pro-
gramme. Belvine, a son of
Belvedere (imp.), is now a geld-
ing.
The continued success in
Australia of New Zealand-
bred horses has moved a team
of Victorian racing men to
form a company aimed at
improving the Australian
thoroughbred. The company,
registered as Stockwell Pty.,
Ltd., has bought Chelandry
Stud at Digger’s Rest. The stud
will be built around the Queen’s
horse . Landau. High-class
mares and possibly another
stallion will be imported from
England. The stud will con-
centrate on breeding horses for
long-distance handicaps and
the classic events.
“Sawtell”: A promising
youngster in Adelaide is the
Chavey Downs colt Raincall,
who boasts a Melbourne Cup
winner as his granddam. His
dam, Rain Sari (by Dhoti), was
the first foal of Rainbird, whom
Billy Cook piloted to victory in
the big Flemington event in
1945. Like her, Raincall is a
chestnut, and if he only inherits
some of her ability will prove
more than useful.

Glamor horse Fettle won his
ninth successive race at Harold
Park on Saturday night. Start-
ing at 7-to-4 on, he convinc-
ingly won the £lOOO Harold
Park Invitation by 1| length
from Highland Jan, with
Malniri a neck away third.
Malniri went fast to take the
lead, with Fettle parked on
the outside of him, running
one wide for most of the
journey. Nearing the home-
turn Fettle shot to the front
and the result was never in
doubt. He ran the distance
(lli furlongs) in 3min. 6|sec.
(recording a mile-rate of 2.7)
and equalling the record set-up
last year by Inter-Dominion
winner Radiant Venture.
Trainer-driver Ron Hayes says
that Fettle is now a certain
starter in this year’s Inter-
Dominion, to be run at Way-
ville (S.A.) in March. Fettle
received tremendous applause
from the crowd of 18,000.

Third cricket - Test at
Durban:
After dismissing Australia for 163
25min. after the start of the second
day, South Africa was in a winning
position. Indeed, no Test-team at
that period of a Test could reason-
ably ask to be in a better position.
And South Africa should have won.
That they didn’t, in the end, win
was their own fault. The blame can
be fully apportioned to the tedious
efforts of its batsmen, in particular
Waite and McGlew. The latter now
has the “honor” of having scored
the slowest century in Test-cricket.
The object of playing lests—m
fact, of playing any grade of cricket
- —is to win; the aim is not solely to
afford opportunities for. individual
batsmen to play endless innings. The
consolidation by McGlew and
Waite on the second day was, to a
great extent, justilied; but certainly
not its prolongation well into the
third day, when enterprising batsmen
should have been in going for the
runs. Australia, which won the
second Test, must now be regarded
as favorites for the series.
The slow batting of the Aus-
tralians in their second innings was
a different horse. They then were
battling (successfully) to save the
Test. In such circumstances (a
similar instance which comes to
mind is the day-long successful-
against-odds rearguard action by
England—Watson and Bailey in
particular—in the second 1953 Test
against Australia) slow batting, with
the eye on the clock as well as the
ball, can still produce mighty
interesting cricket.
Ken Mackay, one of Australia’s
second-innings stalwarts, has played
a goodly part for Australia in sav-
ing the two drawn Tests. He made
65 not-out (out of 3-162) in the
first Test and now 52 not-out in this
third Test. Mackay, it will be
recalled, was only a last-minute
inclusion in the side when Ron
Archer withdrew. He couldn’t
manage Laker in England in 1956,
but so far has handled Tayfield all
right.
South Africa* also let slip out of a
strong grasp the third Test at
Durban in 1949-50, won by Aus-
tralia by five wickets, after Australia
had been behind on the first innings
by 236 runs! When South Africa
had made 311, Australia crashed for
75, main destroyer being Tayfield,
7-23, his name then making its first
impact on the Australian cricketing
public. South Africa in turn
collapsed for 99, though it still held
most of the cards. However, Aus-
tralia, with Harvey (151 not-out) in
the main role, got the 336 necessary
with 25min. to spare.
Pakistan opening-batsman
Hanif Mohammed, in making
337 in the first Test against
West Indies recently, set a new
Test-record —he batted for
16hrs. 3min., longest Test-
innings (or first-class innings)
ever. Previous-longest Test and
first-class innings tyas Sir
Leonard Hutton’s 13hrs. 20min.
in making the Test-record 364
at The Oval in 1938. Hanif,
who first played Test-cricket at
17 (in 1952), one of the
youngest Test-cricketers ever,
has played quite a few very
long and tedious innings in
first-class cricket.

“Atala”: South Australia has
a very promising batsman in
15-year-old John Causby. In
the recent S.A. schoolboys’
competition, he made over
1000 runs, a record aggregate.
He reached the four-figure
mark in his 10th innings, which

On occasion Leo Flynn, or
some other promoter, would
take the 12st. ex-featherweight
out of New York and exhibit
him to a new generation of
fight-followers—a grey-headed
relic of the knockabout ’nine-
ties. When he came back from
these excursions he sank back
into his front-row seat at the
New York circus, which he
always believed could not be
beaten for entertainment value.
He was not always agreeable
to his audience ; he could be
upset by the wrong approach,
and would huffily pretend that
he remembered nothing of his
early days, and would look
blank at mention of Sydney or
Larry Foley. The next day,
properly buttered-up, he might
remember everything, and talk
sagely of things recent or
distant.
It is said that one sour day
he rebuffed Les Darcy, when
the ill-starred middleweight
came to inspect him in 1917.
Darcy just grinned and walked
away.
Not long before Griffo died,
a callow New York reporter
came away from an interview
with him complaining that the
fellow “didn’t have enough
intellect to be sorry for him-
self.” It mystified the inquirer,
who “prodded him with ques-
tions, and got no help.” The
questions seem to have been
as fatuous as the replies were
dryly matter-of-fact.
“Well, you’d have been a
rich man, if you'd been born
thirty years later, Griff. You’d
have fought for Rickard, and
a few bouts with Kilbane or
Dundee would have paid you
more than your whole career in
the ’nineties.”
“Yes, I’d have made a lot of
money. What time is it?”
“Griff, what did you do with
your money?”
“Oh —I spent it.”
“And what about your
friends—don’t they help you?”
“Sure —sure. Fifty cents,
sometimes five bucks. Lots of
the mob died.”
The reporter found out
where he lived —in the trunk-
room of a boarding-house on
West 43rd Street. The place
was conducted by a widow,
Mrs. Collins, and some other
accounts have it that he lived
there rent-free, having be-
friended the late Collins years
before, in a period of affluence.
It could have been so. Griffo
always had the habit of off-
hand generosity.
Disdainful of money, both
coming and going, he instinc-
tively cast his bread upon the
waters, and if it came back in
the form of buttered toast he
accepted it as a natural con-
sequence.
In his later days, sportsmen
in New York organised a fund
to provide his fare back to his
homeland ; the whip-around
brought more than $5OO, and
Griffo tucked the bills into his
pocket with evident gratitude.
A few days later somebody
inquired about his arrange-
ments for returning home.
Griffo put on a disarming grin.
“Don’t be silly,” he said.
“What’s the sense of me going
back ’ome? The old man
wouldn’t know me no more.”
Against this sort of logic
there was no argument —
Griffo stayed in New York.
The contributors, after an
interval of annoyance, began to
concede that the fellow had
taken a rational grasp of the
situation. His grip of the funds
was no less realistic.
He continued to occupy his
familiar post for so long that
he began to take on the appear-
ance of a fixed and permanent
piece of metropolitan furniture.
And then, as the year 1927 was
closing, Griffo failed one day
to show up at his usual stand.
People noticed that the Buddha
in the worn overcoat and cap
was missing. He was found
dead in his room ; his heart
had stopped. He was fifty-six
years of age.
The new generation fare-
welled him with respect. Tex
Rickard stood the price of a
cemetery plot. There was brisk
rivalry between leading pugilists
when it came to a choice of
pall-bearers. Dozens of con-
tributors sent flowers; one of
the biggest wreaths came from
the reigning heavyweight
champion, Gene Tunney.
The man was dead, and the
legend began to live.
His name still sparkles, still
spins its fascination for those
knowing in the glove game.
The most accomplished boxer
ever seen? Very possibly. The
question is tantalising. One
thing is certain, though— most
ringmen would give a fortune
to buy his diabolical skill. But
to pay for it at the price of his
follies —that would be some-
thing else, something to think
over.

Causby has also been doing well
with Woodville (for which
Drennan and Jarman, now in
South Africa, both play) in
Adelaide’s A-grade district-
cricket.

Most important athletic event
in Australia for some time was
the mile clash in Melbourne
last Thursday night between
Herb Elliott and Merv Lincoln.
Elliott won in 3min. 58.75ec.,
just outside John Landy’s
Australian record of 3.58.6.
Lincoln also came-in under
4min. —3.59, which time he had
also run at Melbourne Univer-
sity on March 23 last year,
when he became the second
Australian to run the mile in
less than 4min. in Australia.
This Thursday-night run was
the first time in Australia that
two runners in the one race
had broken 4mm. for the mile.
It was also Elliott’s second
under-4min.-mile. The Satur-
day before (Jan. 25) Elliott, 19,
had become the youngest runner
to get under the 4min. in clock-
ing 3.59.9 at Olympic Park.

Rugby Union international:
England and Australia have met
only ihree times in Rugby Union
Tests, and the first two (one in
1908, the second some 30 years
later) were both won by Aus-
tralia. Ihe third Test, played at
historic Twickenham last Saturday,
was won by England 9-6 after one
of the most thrilling finisfies ever
seen in a Rugby Union international.
(When a U.K. team tours the
Dominions —with far too lengthy an
interval between visits to Australia —
it is a composite team from the
four U.K. countries, and travels
as Great Britain or the British isles;
Britain has chalked-up a few Test
wins over Australia.)
England deserved its win on
Satuiday, being injpry-ridden; for
ali but the first 20min., it was
without brilliant five - eighth
Horrocks-Taylor. Furthermore it
scored two tries to nil, the second
one —by winger Jackson, who scored
a really great try in the corner after
half the team had handled —being
right on the bell {after the time the
bell should have rung, according to
the Australian manager) when a 6-all
draw had seemed inevitable.
Australia, which led 3-0 at half-
time and 6-3 15min. from the end,
was far from disgraced. Its forwards
played grandly, and matched the
Strong English pack. Halves Sum-
mons and Connor and fullback
Curley were the pick of the backs;
centres Lenehan and White were
weak links. Australia’s points came
from a penalty-goal by Lenehan and
a dropped goal by Curley.
At Twickenham on the 1947-48
tour Australia defeated England
11-0, scoring three tries, two by
that fast and tireless breakaway Col
Windon and one by centre Alan
Walker, also known in both Aus-
tralia and England as a cricketer.
Australia’s recipe for victory was
solid forward-play, sound defence
and a lot of individual brilliance.
One of Australia’s best forwards that
day was young Nick Shehadie, play-
ing his first Test. This year’s selec-
tors willed that big Nick, the only
1947-48 tourist over there again,
should be among the 60,000-odd who
watched the game.

“Veryl”: Further to that
comment on the number of
Australian Rules footballers in
the Victorian Sheffield Shield
team (B. 29/1 / ’5B). Last Aus-
tralia Day, in Victoria’s first-
innings collapse on a good
wicket against N.S.W. at the
S.C.G., when the tailenders
were struggling for runs (the
score remained on 99 for about
half-an-hour while a couple of
wickets fell —there was an
ironic cheer when at last the
100th run was hoisted), a pained
voice from the Hill was heard,
“Come on, how about playing
cricket? You’re not playing
Australian Rules now.” The
Victorians looked more like
batsmen in their second innings,
though they couldn’t bat long
enough to save the game.

How many people will Sydney’s
proposed Opera House accom-
modate ? Could I have a few
constructional details ?
Joern Utzon’s design provides for
two main auditoria, the larger hall
to be used for symphony-concerts,
opera, ballet and dances, choral
pageants and mass meetings. If
will accommodate 3000 people. The
smaller hall, capacity 1200, will be
available for drama, intimate
opera, chamber-music, lectures, con-
certs and recitals. Each hall will
have separate rehearsal-rooms for
orchestral, choral and other
performances.
Two meeting-rooms, seating 100
and 200 persons respectively, will
be used for formal gatherings of
groups interested in general cul-
tural subjects, as well as for dances,
exhibitions, etc. There will be a
restaurant with seating for 250
people, and a broadcasting and TV
control-room.
The approach to the Opera House
will lead on to a large open piazza,
from which two wide stairways will
sweep up to the doors and front-
iow seats of the two halls. The
“Paint one upside-down , dug —THAT’LL trick ’em.”
white-tiled shell-vaults on the
exterior of the building, described
as “white sail-like forms,” will span
the two main halls and restaurant
in three units; the highest shell,
planned to rise 150 ft. above ground-
level, will cover the stage-tower.
Ceilings to be acoustic, interior
walls of natural-timber panels. The
base of the building will be of heavy
sandstone.

Brief information on the ill-fated
windjammer Pamir, also of her
sister-ship Passat ?
Launched in Hamburg in 1905, the
3020-ton Pamir was sold to Finnish
owners in 1931. In August, 1941, the
N.Z. Government seized her in
Wellington harbor following Fin-
land’s entry into the war as an ally
of Germany. (In War I, also, Pamir
had been a war-prize, of Great
Britain.) Both Pamir and Passat
(3181 tons) took part in many of
the famous grain-races of the 1930’s
and the early post-War-II years. In
1948 the two were the only com-
petitors in what was the last grain-
race, Passat, in 148 days, pipping
Pamir by 24 hours. Pamir made
another trip to Australia and N.Z.
in 1949. The two vessels then
became training-ships for the Ger-
man Merchant Navy. Pamir sank
in an Atlantic storm on Sept. 21
last year, with the loss of 80 of her
complement of 86, many of whom
were midshipmen. (A German
Maritime Board recently found that
improper control of the sails had
contributed largely to Pamir’s
foundering. The captain, who went
down with the ship, was on his first
voyage as master of Pamir, and the
first-officer, also drowned, had
limited sailing-ship experience.) On
Nov. 6, 1957, six weeks after Pamir
foundered, Passat, then midway
between the Azores and Portugal,
also sent out SOS’s; her cargo had
shifted during a storm. However,
Passat later cancelled her distress-
signals. That was Passat’s last
voyage, and as far as is known she
is now tied-up at Plamburg.

Words of verse beginning “The
night has a thousand eyes” ?
The Night has a thousand eyes,
And the Day but one;
Yet the light of the bright .world dies
With the dying sun.
The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one;
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done.
It was written by the 19th-century
poet Francis William Bourdillon.

Are there any grounds on which
a person, once naturalised, can be
deported ?
The Nationality and Citizenship
Act (1948-55) provides power for
the revocation of certificates of
naturalisation granted to a person
who (a) has shown himself by act
or speech to be disloyal or
disaffected towards her Majesty; ( b )
has, during any war in which Aus-
tralia is or has been engaged, unlaw-
fully traded or communicated with
the enemy, or been engaged on, or
associated with, any business which
was to his knowledge carried on in
such a manner as to assist an enemy
in that war; (c) was naturalised by
means of fraud, false representation
cr concealment of some material
circumstance; ( d) was not, at the
date on which he was naturalised, of
good character; or (e) has, within
five years after the date of naturalisa-
tion, been sentenced in any country
to imprisonment for a term of 12
months or more,
Cases of type (a) and (d) are
referred to an inquiry-committee for
subsequent report; cases of type <*?)
may be dealt with by the Minister
without reference to a committee of
inquiry. Flowever, in all cases
the Act provides that the Minister
shall not make an order for
revocation unless he is thoroughly
satisfied that a person should not
remain an Australian citizen.
Moves are afoot to amend the
Nationality and Citizenship Act,
so that persons who have been
sentenced to imprisonment within five
years of naturalisation will not be
Lable to have the certificate of
naturalisation revoked. Where

Information on the Association of
Blind Citizens and Club ?
ifle association, comprised
entirely of blind people, provides
them with a means of expressing
their views on matters which have
a bearing on their lives and well-
being, such as higher education for
the blind, more opportunities for
their industrial and commercial
employment, and a greater accept-
ance by society of professional skills
possessed by the blind.
Activities of the association are
controlled and directed by blind
people. Each of its members (any
blind person in New South Wales
over 16) has the right to bring
forward for discussion at its regular
meetings any matter which he feels
relates to the welfare of the blind.
The association advises that it is
non-sectarian, and has no political
affiliations. At its city address
it maintains a Braille library
and rest-room for the con-
venience of blind people coming into

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
"SUMMIT" TALKS
THE West has so often
finished-up the loser in
“talks” with the Soviet that
some caution, if not reluctance,
is understandable enough in its
attitude towards the latest sug-
gestions for a “summit meet-
ing.” As the following sampl-
ing of British and American
press-comment indicates, how-
ever, the demand for some such
meeting is becoming more and
more insistent:
London “Daily Express”:
“Having drifted along from the
end of the war in 1945, watch-
ing the world split into two,
armed every year with deadlier
weapons —having watched this
process, the peoples are sud-
denly not content to watch any
longer.
“As Messrs. Bulganin and
Khrushchev have been calling
tor talks in every variation of
diplomatic language, it looks
like a victory for Russian
propaganda. And maybe it is.
Maybe the Russian leaders
have been quicker to scent a
change in the wind of inter-
national feeling.
“Or maybe they are aware
or a longing for peace among
their own people. Why not?
Are Russians so different from
the rest of us?”
The same: “Talk, particu-
larly when it occurs behind
closed doors, has no harm
in it. Nothing may come
of it. But something may
be gained. Russia wants a
meeting. So does the British
public. The Americans? They
are divided. The American
Government should listen to
warning voices demanding
talks. So should Mr.
Macmillan.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“To meet at the summit or not
to meet at the summit, that
seems to be the question posed
in Mr. Bulganin’s latest letter to
the [British] Prime Minister.
We [the “D.T.”] believe that
this question is wholly prema-
ture. There is no virtue in
summit meetings until each
side knows not only what it
wants to say to the other but —
equally important—what the
other side wants to say to
it. There is clearly nothing to
be gained by Mr. Eisenhower
travelling to Geneva to meet
Mr. Bulganin unless both
leaders believe that there
definitely exists a reasonable
possibility of constructive agree-
ments being reached. No such
prior understanding preceded
the last summit conference at
Geneva. As a result nothing
was achieved except confusion
which in turn led to subsequent
misunderstandings and in-
creased tensions.”
« • • •
The same : “Quite contrary
to the public belief, there is no

MIND MY BIKE
simple, easy way of reducing
tension just waiting to be
seized by the heads of govern-
ment. The present East-West
deadlock has ramifications of
almost infinite complexity. As
in a game of chess a single
move by a single pawn could
lead to triumph or disaster.
New moves do exist, and they
must be carefully explored. But
patience, caution and silence
should be the watchwords,
rather than precipitancy, radical
innovation, and ceaseless
propaganda.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post”: “Patient,
determined efforts to reach
some working agreement with
the Russians that will check the
perilous nuclear-arms race and
bring about at least a measure
of disarmament should not be
dismissed as appeasement.”
* * *
Edinburgh “Scotsman’s”
di pi o matic correspondent:
“That the Russians are eager
for summit talks is apparent
from the series of Bulganin
letters. What is not so certain
is if they are equally eager to
reach agreement. Past experi-
cnce has shown that propa-
ganda rather than concrete
results is what they are after,
In this respect Mr. Khrushchev
somewhat resembles the
parsimonious suitor of whom
the girl said he was ‘all talk
and no chocolate.’
“But it is contrary to the
public mood that the Western
statesmen should continue to
dwell on the past. They are
asked not only to test the
sincerity of the Soviet Govern-
ment’s continual declarations
that they want peace, but to
establish clearly, for all the
world to see, that they are
really prepared to go to the
limit of Western security in
order to enable the non-Com-
munist and Communist parts of
the world to live together in
peace.”
* * *
London “Observer”: “In
pursuing this dual approach to
the problems of world stability
—via disengagement and via
disarmament and the inter-
national control of nuclear
power—we must be prepared to
pursue our end with or without
Russian agreement. Obviously,
agreement with the Soviets is of
the first importance, and to
reach it we must be ready to
make sacrifices. Diplomatic-
ally, we must be ready to leave
America to negotiate alone with
Russia, once a broad Western
policy has been agreed;
militarily, we must be ready to
support a joint Russian-
American withdrawal from a
Central Europe denuded of
nuclear weapons ; in matters of
prestige, we must be ready to
welcome a Soviet-American
world inspectorate (calling
itself, no doubt, United
Nations).”
....
The same: “If the West has
to try to form the nucleus of a
world-control system within the
two-thirds of the world that is
not Communist-governed, we
believe that, despite all the in-
conveniences, it should attempt
{c do so via the machinery of
the United Nations. Not only
would this make the necessary
inspection more tolerable, it
would also put a strong
pressure on the Communist
States to join. So long as they
stayed outside, the relations of
the West to the neutrals,
particularly in Asia, would be
improved at their expense,
“But the West should not
adopt this course until it is
absolutely clear that Russian
co-operation is unobtainable,
And even then we should never
forget the obvious fact that
world stability can be organised
only with the co-operation of
the Communist States. We
should bear in mind that this,
and nothing less, is our aim, no
matter what vicissitudes our
policies may suffer.”

“New York Times”: “The
best New Year’s resolution that
could be made—and kept—in
the field of foreign affairs is
suggested by the remarks of
Theodor Heuss, President of
West Germany, in his New
Year’s Eve message to the Ger-

out negotiations rather than to

“If there is really serious pur-
pose to reach agreement on the
disputes that so deeply divide
the free world from the Soviet
world —and there must be such
purpose on our side at least —
the way to start is not through
a full-blown ‘summit’ confer-
ence under the glare of pub-
licity that makes true negotia-
tions all but impossible. The
way to start is through con-
stant private probing in every
direction and at every oppor-
tunity. The ‘summit’ that the
Russians seem so ardently to
desire can come only after the
loothills have been mastered.”

Cleveland ( U.S.A .) “Plain
Dealer” : “If Khrushchev
should agree to a reasonable
inspection-system, we should
meet him halfway. For the
ultimate, result of an atomic-
missile arms-race is ruin for the
entire world. Khrushchev, no
fool, may consider it is time to
pull in his horns. Perhaps his
announcement of reduction in
the size of the Soviet armies
is a portent of things to come.
We doubt it—but miracles have
happened!”

New York “Herald Tribune ”
editorial comment: “The tech-
nique of announcing that the
Kremlin will call unilaterally
for a conference of many
nations was evidently adopted
in the hope of wooing any
Western States that may be
more concerned with conferring
for their own sake than with
maintaining the unity of the
free in order to lay a founda-
tion of strength and purpose
for negotiations. There is
something characteristically
arrogant in summoning heads
of State to meet at the Krem-
lin’s behest. But Premier
Bulganin might study with
profit Hotspur’s reply to Glen-
dower, when the latter boasted:
‘I can call spirits from the
vasty deep.’ ‘Why, so can I,
or so can any man,’ replied
Hotspur. ‘But will they come
when you do call for them?’ ”

Walter Lippmann in New
York “Herald Tribune” : “The
thread to take hold of in this
tangled skein is the suggestion
from Moscow that there be a
limitation of nuclear arms in,
and perhaps even a military
evacuation of, a great area of
Central Europe, covering the
two Germanys, Poland and
Czechoslovakia. Nobody
knows whether Moscow is seri-
ous about this, or that it would
negotiate seriously about it.
What we can know is that this
is the type of agreement which,
if it were arrived at, would be
likely to be workable.
“On the other hand, there is
little prospect of a successful
negotiation and a reliable
agreement, be it on the Western
terms or on the Soviet terms,
about disarmament in general.
The whole disarmament busi-
ness, in fact, is on both sides
more propaganda than any-
thing else, and the more elabor-
ate and complicated our pro-
grammes becomes, the more
certain we can be that nobody
is really serious about them.”

“It may well be true that this
is just an idle dream and that
the Russians have no intention
whatever of accepting any such
thing. But if these Bulganin
letters mean anything but just
another bit of disruptive propa-
ganda, that is what they mean.
“So why not take them up
and put them to the test? Let
us say to the Kremlin in effect
—right, we shall want con-
vincing by deeds this time, not
merely by words; but let us
get our planners down to it to

London “Time and Tide”:
“The West has been testing
Kremlin sincerity for 12 years
with conclusive negative results.
At the moment the Kremlin
is openly inciting subversion
against any African or Middle-
Eastern Government which is
not Communist-controlled or
under Communist influence.
For good measure the Kremlin
has also invited the under-
developed countries to help
themselves to some capital by
seizing all the Western property
within their boundaries. All
this, coupled with Mr. Khrush-
chev’s threat to turn the
Western world into a cemetery,
should be test enough for any-
body who is not completely
stupefied either with folly or
with fear or with both.
“Yet it is not enough for a
huge and growing proportion
of our people. Mr. Khrush-
chev has never concealed his
determination to work night
and day to make the entire
world Communist. He told the
American people on television
that their grandchildren would
be Communists and they
certainly will be if he can have
his way. On that point at least
he is entirely sincere. He will
use any means to reach this end
and at the moment he wants to
use summit talks.
“And well he might. All the
summit talks held so far have
resulted in solid gains for the
Kremlin, and another session
would have the same result, or
no result at all. Our summitees
admit and even insist with a
kind of masochistic relish that
we cannot hope to wring con-
cessions from Mr. Khrush-
chev without making con-
cessions in return. But the
whole history of these lament-
able exercises proves that the
concessions made by the West
are irrevocable while the. con-
cessions made by the Kremlin
are scrapped at the first con-
venient moment.”
The same : “Summit talks are
now considered as the only
alternative to an indefinite
arms-race, with all the grievous
cost and danger which that
implies. But, in fact, there is no
alternative to the race except
Mr. Khrushchev’s abandonment
of Communist doctrine. Be-
cause this fact is unpalatable it
does not cease to be true.
However, an indefinite arms-
race does not necessarily mean
an endless one. The strain of
it is severe enough in Britain
and the United States ; it must
be more severe in the U.S.S.R.
The day may come when the
Russian people have had more
than they can bear and those
who are then the bosses in the
Kremlin will be forced to seek
some kind of accommodation
with the West.”
School for
"Europeons"
“New York Times” editorial
comment on the first
“European” school (in Luxem-
bourg)—“a model for more to
follow”:
“The school is sponsored by
the European Coal and Steel
Community, the trail-blazer of
European unification, and by
the Governments of the six
countries comprising it —
France, Germany, Italy,
Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg. Should it prove
to be a success, similar schools
are expected to be founded by
the two new communities
[European Economic and
Atomic Energy Communities]
consisting of the same nations,
“The importance attached to
this new educational enterprise
is attested by the presence at
the dedication ceremonies of
the Foreign and Cultural
Ministers of the nations con-
cerned. It has always been one
of the main handicaps of the
European unification move-
ment that, aside from the out-
standing leaders who created
the three communjties,
Europe had too few ‘good
Europeans.’ Most Europeans
have felt, and still feel, them-
selves solely as nationals of
their respective countries, with
Europe merely a geographical
expression.
“The new school and those to
follow it are intended to
remedy this handicap, not by
denationalising their pupils, but
by instilling in the new genera-
tion a European consciousness,
a European loyalty and
patriotism that will not conflict
with but will transcend the old
particularism in favor of the
larger whole. With that in
view, both the teaching staffs
and the educational pro-
grammes are organised from an
all - European rather than a
national standpoint. It will be

“So the Russians fail in their
plans for plenty and we fail in
our plans for less. Here’s a
fine place, to borrow an idea
from ‘The Wall Street Journal,’
to start an exchange.
“Send our farm-planners to
Moscow, let theirs come here.
Their plans for increased pro-
duction would cut-down our
farm output and our plans for
scarcity would soon have their
barns bulging.”
Soviet Defence Cuts?
Suggesting that the Soviet's
threats against the Nato
countries had the unexpected
effect of creating a war scare
in Russia as well as other
places, London “Time and
Tide” sees the reduction by
300,000 in the Soviet Armed
Forces in Eastern Europe as “a
psychological move intended to
reassure the Russian people
even more than to impress the
West. It was a last-moment
decision, made at the meeting
of the Supreme Council on
December 21, after the military
budget had already been
approved. It has since been
found necessary to state that the
money saved on the military
budget will be diverted for
peaceful construction.
“The decision to make a
small cut in the Soviet armed
forces was a direct result of the
anxiety expressed by delegates
to the Supreme Council regard-
ing public reaction and the
general fear of war. The crisis
in the leadership of the Soviet
Union has been followed Iby a
crisis among the people, which
the Government has had to
recognise. The Russian people
are as much against war as
the peoples of the West.
“The way is now open for
Britain and the U.S.A. to take
a leaf out of the Soviet book
and appeal directly to the
peace-loving people of Russia
to unite in their demand for
a genuine peace. This type
of psychological warfare would
be far more effective than top-
level talks with Soviet leaders.”
In further comment on the
same subject, N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” suggests “that the
Soviet Union is releasing its
soldiers, sailors and flyers as
a matter of economic necessity”
because of “the drop in the
birth-rate over the last two
decades. In 1938 the rate was
38 per 1000 population, accord-
ing to the best available figures.
Then it plummeted to 10 per
1000 during the war years of
1940-45, gradually increased to
25 per 1000 in 1950 and is now
believed to be around 27. In
addition the total war decre-
ment to the nation was about
20-million.
“As a result of the extremely
low birth-rate in the
1940’5, there are far too few'
young men and women coming
along to fill the labor quotas in
industry and agriculture, to say
nothing of the armed forces
themselves. And the only way
to solve this manpower short-
age is to take some from the
overloaded military, plus, of
course, such Hungarians and
nationals of other satellites as
can be deported to forced-labor
camps.
“In announcing this ‘good-
will’ move, the Communists are
simply trying to make profit-
able political propaganda out
of a step urgently dictated by a
national shortage.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
“Personality”-tests
I hope that Australian in-
dustrial organisations will never
try to subject their employees
to personality-tests similar to
those used by many hig
American corporations.
Although, at first glance,
many of the standard tests
simply ask you to answer a lot
of questions which take little
time or thought on your part,
testers claim that the answers
enable them to judge your
character, ability, and whether
you will fit into “the group”—
meaning the corporation or
section of it you are anxious to
join.
It is said to be almost im-
possible these days for an
American in a white-collar job
to reach the age of 21-years
without having submitted to a
battery of tests.
Up-to-date testing is not
wholly concerned with aptitude
as it was during the scientific-
management movement of the
’twenties. It is admitted that
aptitude- and intelligence-tests
give some indication of a man’s
capabilities, but those modern
psychologists who are doing
very well out of the testing
business have convinced today’s
employers that they now have
tests which can measure almost
any aspect of a man’s person-
ality.
The Bemreuter Personality
Inventory, for instance, re-
quires the subject to answer
125 questions, and the answers
to these are checked against,
norms, after which the testers
claim to be able to give a per-
centile rating as to his degree
of neurotic tendency, self-
sufficiency, introversion, domi-
nance, etc.
The Personal Audit, the
Thurstone Temperament
Schedule, the Thematic Apper-
ception Test, and the Minne-
sota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory are among those
used to test the subject’s suit-
ability for the job.
Some companies even make
use of the Rorschach Inkblot
Test, although psychiatrists
are definitely opposed to the
use of this for such a purpose.
Dr. S. W. Ginsburg, of
Columbia University, has said:
“Rorschach never dreamed his
test would be used in the way
it has been used. His most dis-
tinguished pupils have also
warned against misapplying
the test. It has no place in
industry for selection pur-
poses.”
Don’t think that a subject
can escape psychoanalysis by
refusing to answer any of the
questions. The testers note the
questions he refuses to answer
“Ahoy! Close the door, someone !”
and insist that they can deduce
almost as much about his
character as if he had co-
operated fully.
In the case of projective
tests, such as the Thematic
Apperception Test, the subject
is shown a picture and asked
to compose a story about it,
and this is scanned for latent
feeling and psychoses.
Those who are against the
tests quote the story of a
youth who was given the pic-
ture of a man going out of a
doorway with a worried expres-
sion on his face and asked for
his opinion of what it could
represent. The youth was a
keen history student, so he told
a story about some famous
historical figure who had a
difficult choice to make. Then
he sat back and patted himself
on the back. He knew the story
was well written and interest-
ing. This led him to believe
that it would be received as an
admirable piece of work which
would further his chance of
getting the job he was after.
But the tester thought other-
wise. Because the student had
written a story about people
who were dead he received the
brand maladjustment.
Protective tests were origi-
nally meant to be used only as a
part of an exhaustive clinical
diagnosis, but big business in
America sails happily on —it is
said that 60 per cent, of the
large corporations and many
smaller ones still use these
tests.
As a layman with only a
limited knowledge of psycho-
logy it seems to me that the
worst aspect of the whole busi-
ness is that a cheat who knew
the ropes could get a job by
giving the answers he knew
were expected of him, while the
more honest, really suitable
applicant might be passed over.
News gets around, and I am
only one of thousands who now
know that there are certain
answers to questions which will
help you beat the other fellow
to the job.
You must state that:
You loved both your parents but
Dad came first.
You love your wife and family.
You like things as they are
(mustn’t be too anxious to change
the world or anything in it —that
would be a sign of instability).
You don’t allow things to worry
you.
You don’t care much for books,
music, or anything on the cultural
side (people who do are often not
successful in business).
You love your work and don’t
allow family obligations to interfere
with it.
These answers will show that
you are normal, well adjusted,
and ready to forge ahead —in
America.
I hope it never happens
here. — Campbell Joe (Vic.).
N.S.W. Railway -carriages
The N. S. Wales Railway
Commissioner is no doubt
proud of the air-conditioned
and comfortable accommoda-
tion of both first- and second-
class carriages of the Central
West daylight express with all
amenities—hostess, buffet and
other refinements. Side-by-
side with these showpieces, and
operating on the same route
to Mount Victoria at the same
first- and second-class fares, are
several sets of carriages—grimy,
ill-conditioned, with toilet
amenities approximating those
of a doss-house. Three times
daily, each way, trains made up
of these carriages cater for
passengers and, if one is mug
enough to pay “first-class”
travel —well, that’s just too bad.
But since the commissioner is
vested with power to prosecute
a passenger travelling in a
carriage of superior class to
that for \yhich -a fare has been
paid, there should, in fairness,
be some legal process to compel
the commissioner to honor his
side of the contract.
The only sign of distinction
between the carriages under
criticism is the legend “Ist”
pointed on one or two of the
six or eight cars making up
the train cx-Mt. Victoria at
0455, 1032 and 1740 hours
and, frequently, a sticker, on a
window, reading “second-
class,” reduces the status of
a car of alleged superior
lineage.
A more apt description of
these vehicles would be the
French legend so well known to
the men of the Ist A.1.F.: “20


F*uth in iJic
Future
i
r
When we talk of the Future I wonder how
many of us realise what wonders are being made
for it in the shape of domestic and industrial power.
With the splitting of the atom in radio-active
solids the whole Concept of power for the world
was changed—and many were prepared to accept
that as the ultimate. But the opposite process in
the production of nuclear energy—the fusing of
the atoms of hydrogen—has caused even that
amazing prospect to widen.
Man is on the way to harnessing the power
that is in limitless source in the oceans around us.
In simple terms, that is what is meant by the official
announcement from the British nuclear research
station at Harwell: that atoms of heavy hydrogen
can be controlled under conditions of tremendous
heat.
The social and commercial implications of this
discovery are enormous. It means that homes and
industries and transport in the future may be
powered by thermo-nuclear units.
Years may pass before the process is available
in practical, everyday form; but the important thing
is that the principle of control has been established.
Some authorities rate this as far more significant
to human progress than the launching of satellites
into space.
We have cause for pride, then, that one of the
scientists chiefly responsible for this discovery is an
Australian —a young Melbourne and Sydney
University man, Dr. Peter Thonemann, son of one
of our Northern Territory families, to whom full
tribute has been paid by the director of British
nuclear research, Sir John Cockcroft.
The momentum that has been gained in recent
years in controlling the forces of Nature is such as
to dare all estimate of what tomorrow holds in the
provision of power for the service of mankind.
But whatever it brings, Australia will be
sharing in it; and I believe that development yet
undreamed of for this country will flow from the
fountains of power that science is now tapping.

“Modem Art”
Lusby’s sketch of the
sculptor ruining a perfectly
good block of stone (B.
8/1/’5B) appeared just as the
director of the Victorian
National Gallery (Eric West-
brook) had voiced the opinion
that most of our “contem-
porary art” is unintelligible
nonsense.
Mr. Westbrook thus con-
firmed the opinion long held by
most intelligent people. For
too long we laymen have had
to put up with superior asser-
tions that the mind of the
“artist” sees things quite
differently from the way we
do. There is nothing more
irritating than to be told that
there is some deep, underlying
significance in these weird
manifestations in paint, and
that we are at fault in not
gazing with stricken awe on
such productions.
“Contemporary artists,” as
they call themselves, are noth-
ing if not ingenious. One, an
English painter, who produces
what he calls pictures, by
throwing paint on a board and
then riding a bicycle over the
fresh paint, asks 100 guineas
each for them!
It’s high time this so-called
“art” was debunked, and we
are all grateful to Mr. West-
brook for doing just that. He
has pointed out that what is
lacking in art today is a con-
viction that there are common
human ideas and values which
artists and their public can
share, as they have done in
the past. — Ceg (Vic.).
Sydney’s Water
Just out* of Sydney, in a
“tank - water” district, my
elderly mother, like most of her
neighbors, presses a .switch and
goes out to sit in her garden
while the electric pump sends
ample cool, sparkling water
gushing and spraying Over her
thirsty lawn and flower-beds.
It costs her a little for
electricity, but nothing for
excess water.
In recent months, while
all the water - restrictions
were on, you’d have found
some Sydneyite compressing his
paunch under the front hedge,
and surreptitiously watering his
front lawn. His wife goes
possum while busily carting
buckets from the back tap to
Water the roses. Under our
accusing eye they wail, “There’s
money in this garden.”
Yet there is plenty of water,
10ft., to 20ft. under thousands
of Sydney’s gardens. Old wells,
now rubble-filled, are mute
evidence. No danger is
involved with a pipe and pump.
But mention 40-quid for this
amenity, and gardeners almost
froth at the mouth —“The
money! And when will we
have another drought like
this?”
Look in any garage and
you’ll find a motor-mower.
Fifty-pounds to cut the lawn,
but not to grow it. Fifty-
pounds for shrubs and trees,
but water, like air, is free, and
should remain so! — Gwenny
(N.S.W.).
W. M. Hughes
So far from restoring my
esteem for W. M. Hughes's
veracity as a raconteur, “Jade”
(B. 22/1/ ’5B) merely shows
very clearly how unreliable he
was. It would seem, on “Jade’s”
evidence, that from a high
point “about four miles from
Tewantin,” an occasional and
faint view of the Glasshouse
Mountains is possible. I’ll
accept that testimony—though
people who know the district
well suggest that he’s seeing
Ninderry, Buderim, Coolum
and intervening peaks—but if
“Jade” will look up W.M.H.’s
Crusts and Crusades (pp. 24-25)
he will find that Hughes claimed
he could see the Glasshouse
Mountains from a point “well
to the north of Tewantin.”
As a matter of fact, it was
from the top of Mt. Bauple. I
hesitated to make the exact
identification because W. M.
Hughes spells it “Bopple,” but
the text at p. 25 makes the
identification sure by speaking
of “the sea some miles distant,
with Fraser Island and the
narrow straits that divide it
from the mainland.” Moreover,
a forestry-ranger whom I con-
sulted recently told me that the
“Bopple” spelling is common
enough.
Well, Hughes and his com-
panion, having climbed Mt.
Bopple, could see nothing from
its summit till he himself
climbed “the most promising
and loftiest gum.” From that
vantage-point he then saw, “a
long way off to the south, the
Glasshouse Mountains.”
From Tewantin to Bauple is
some 60 miles ; from Tewantin
to the Glasshouses direct some
40 miles. So we are asked to
believe that what most think
cannot be seen from Tewantin
(and indeed cannot be seen
from Tewantin itself), and at


fcest can be seen only occasion-
ally and faintly, can be seen 60
miles further north, and from
what is little better than a hill.
Forestry men who have worked
around Bauple and Gympie for
years tell me that if Hughes
saw anything from that summit
it would have been peaks like
Curran, Pomona, Pilbarren or
at best Mt. Coorong, some of
which look glasshousy indeed.
But the Glasshouses are still
at least 40 miles south of these
again.
No! William Morris was
again drawing the long-bow, as
he did in the many cases that
M. H. Ellis indicated in the
article which caused me to
take up pen in the matter. —-
Mark Heim (Q.).
Juvenile Employment
In this central North Coast
(N.S.W.) town, 13 girls, all
with their Intermediate Certifi-
cate, recently completed a year
of technical-college training in
office-practice, business-prin-
ciples, shorthand and typing. In
the foreseeable future, local
employment is available for
only two, and a further 35 girls
have signified their intention
of taking a similar course next
year.
Other girls with varying
educational backgrounds face a
similar employment outlook.
The normal wastage which
previously ensured jobs for
most girls leaving school
appears to have almost
vanished, a majority of girls
now returning to work imrnedi-
ately after marriage. In this
town, married women
generally with husbands in
good jobs—constitute a big pro-
portion of the female labor-
force.
Businessmen should seriously
consider the question of retain-
j n g married women, except in
exceptional circumstances, in
preference to single girls. The
hopeless employment outlook
f or both girls and boys is a big
f actor j n t h e drift to the cities,
and every family that leaves a
country area reduces the pros-
perity of that area. —Stanus
(N.S.W.).
Antiquated (?) Trams
It’s not strictly accurate to
say that Sydney is conforming
with the rest of the world in
changing its trams for buses (B.
22/1/’5B). The board of the
Brussels transport authority
stressed in a recent annual
report that although it was buy-
ing 150 new buses no priority
was to be given to this form of
transport. The policy in
Brussels is to get the trams into
special reserved tracks wher-
ever possible (as in Sydney’s
“I suppose third-party insurance will go up again.”
Anzac Parade). The board
pointed out that it particularly
wished to avoid the pedestrian
speeds in bus transport to be
found in the centres of, Paris
and New York.
Brussels, with a population
of only about one million, is
currently spending £l4 million
on works such as underground
and overhead roads to alleviate
traffic-congestion, which makes
the efforts of Sydney and Mel-
bourne in this direction look
rather feeble. But in all this
there is no talk of scrapping
tramways—they are merely
being disentangled from other
traffic, allowing both public and
private transport to move
fieely.
And Brussels is not the only
company Melbourne has in
retaining trams. Most big cities
m those European countries
which have made a good
recovery since the war are
doing so. Take Hamburg,
which has a population very
close to Melbourne’s. s Along
with the rest of the city, Ham-
burg’s public transport was
practically wiped out during the
war. But by the end of 1953
Hamburg had 156 miles of
tramways which carried 257-
million passengers for the year
against 76 miles of bus and
trolley-bus routes which carried
only 35|-million passengers. In
Hamburg the opinion is undis-
puted that tramways are the
only appropriate form of street-
transport where the demand is

are to be found entirely in the

Those who think that the
construction of one short

Melbourne will render the trams
superfluous should note that

Trams and Buses
In Sydney the N. S. Wales
Department of Government
Transport is proudly anouncing
that “at Park Street in one
hour from 4.30 p.m. onwards
there will be 104 buses capable
of carrying over 7000 people
along Pitt Street.” To do this
the most rigid prohibition of
parking is required and also
plenty of co-operation from the
traffic-police.
In Brisbane, on the other
hand, the acting Lord Mayor is
lamenting the fact that only 35
trams can cross Victoria Bridge
between 5 and 5.15 p.m. These
trams are “capable of carrying”
3850 people—i.e., more than
half as many as the Sydney
buses in only a quarter of the
time.
Either the Sydney Depart-
ment is patting itself on the
back unnecessarily, or
Brisbane’s acting Lord Mayor

The Press
I agree with “Ex-Scouter”
(B. 8/1 / ’5B) that the metro-
politan daily press of Aus-
tralia is largely to blame for
many of the ills which afflict
our community today. These
ills stem mainly from the lack
of responsibility towards the
problems of life shown by so
many people, young and old.
The press encourages this lack
of responsibility by giving so
much space and prominence to
the things that don’t really
matter, rather than to the things
that do. *
Some of the activities
boosted to a position of undue
importance by newspapers are
not necessarily evil in them-
selves, but by constant repeti-
tion they are made to appear as
if they really mattered in the
scheme of life, whereas they
don’t.
Take sport, for example. I
recall when sport was a
necessary and beneficial relaxa-
tion from work ; but today, due
mainly to newspaper and
broadcasting publicity, it has
become one of our major
“Industrie s.” As many
branches of sport are closely
associated with gambling,
particularly horse- and dog-
racing, they exert an evil rather
than a beneficial influence on
the community.
There’s no harm in a small
gamble, particularly when the
money laid out is not at the
expense of the butcher or
baker; but gambling on the
scale we have it today not only
diverts a great deal of money
from more useful channels, but
convinces those who profit by
it that it is a worthy enterprise.
It also makes the losers deter-
mined to keep on trying in the
hope that they will retrieve their
losses.
It has been truly said that
when a person’s mind is on one
thing, it can’t be on another ;
and it is equally true that
money spent on gambling, in
any form, is diverted from
other and more worthy
channels. The press and
broadcasting are directly to
blame for our obsession with
sport today, and are therefore
indirectly responsible for the
preoccupation of so many
people with gambling in its
various forms.
Newspapers and radio must
also carry a heavy share of
blame for the general breaking-
down of the moral standards of
the community. People do
things today which would have
made them social outcasts a
quarter of a century ago, and
nothing is thought of it. Public
men get away with practices
which would have driven them
out of community-life when I
was a youth. Today they are
merely regarded as “shrewd”
fellows.
A prominent Australian
newspaper-executive told me
lately that, although his paper
frowned on the use of the
word “rape” in its news-
columns, the use of the word
on a poster would boost sales
on any one day by as much
as 5000 copies. “And sales
count,” he grinned. They do,
more’s the pity. It is in the
frantic scramble for circulation,
which in turn boosts advertising
and advertising-rates, that
metropolitan daily newspapers
resort to the use of so much
material the community would
be better without. Peter

MY reading of U.S. farming-

seeking power to reduce sub-

be more political than
economic. It seems to be

widely conceded that the large

Government price - support
scheme are an embarrassment,
politically and economically, in
international relations, and it
is also recognised that sub-

ing efficiency, and has urged
their reduction and the organis-
ing of farmers so as to establish
and control their own economic
welfare.
Mr. Benson, U.S. Secretary
for Agriculture, began to
reduce subsidies years ago.
Other factors causing a drop in
milk-prices are the big increases
in production due to technical
advances, the intense and well-
organised competition from
substitutes, and the thousands
of new, well-advertised pro-
ducts that people want to buy
at the expense of their milk-
budgets. Total consumption of
milk-products is going up, but
not in proportion to their total
production, or their potential
production due to technical
advances.
“Hoard’s” states that since
1944 one - million dairymen
have gone out of business —and
this is considered to be not such
a bad thing. There were too
many small producers and part-
time dairymen and too many
farms always on the verge of
economic collapse. They were
inefficient as producers of milk,
and often they could not
achieve good quality.
The number of farmers sell-
ing milk or cream in the U.S.
is now estimated at 1,250,000,
but “Hoard’s” considers the
nation’s milk - requirements

could be met by only 325,000
farmers, each with 40 cows,

Americans are leahsmg now

efficient industry such as this
cannot achieve the stability and
security it needs if it is
dependent on the goodwill of
politicians. American farmers,
therefore, are making strong
efforts to sink their difference?
of interest and opinion in order
to form an effective overall
organisation.
The American Dairy
Association conducts big
advertising campaigns, with
TV- and glamor-contests, and
it gives active political opposi-
tion to the wiles of milk’s
competitors. The demand for
milk is boosted by automatic
vendors, carefully studied
packaging, flavoring, proces-
sing, and by a constant search
for new ways to make milk
more attractive, more easily
handled, and less perishable,
There is. also announced a
new plan in answer to the
Federal Government’s request
f or the dairy-industry to look
after its own affairs. The
motion of half-a-million dairy-
farmers about this plan
begins: “We believe in the

if it might help to make sub-
sidies unnecessary.
There is no need for us to
copy Americans in their
marketing or technical
organisation —in some things
we are distinctly in the lead—
but some of our problems,
present and potential, are so
much like those in the U.S.A.
that we can profitably watch
the progress of such schemes
very closely.
Our butter-export problem is
different from any of the U.S.
problems, and it has its effect
on the marketing of household-
milk. There is bound to be
ill-feeling between farmers who
suffer from low butter-export
prices and those who enjoy
high milk-prices, and this is
aggravated by the consumers of
milk, who feel that they are
entitled to the cl/eap milk
offered to them by the butter-
farmers.
Milk-zoning and high prices
have been necessary to build-
up a constant, dependable and
clean supply that is maintained
through winter and dry weather
by farmers who are able to
store or buy feed. Much of
the friction and bad feeling
over milk-supply is due to the
fact that the control is imposed
by Government bodies.
If we can learn, with the help
of experience in other
countries, to set up a producers’
organisation to control all pro-
duction and marketing, we shall
have achieved a democratic
and a much more flexible and
adaptable means of solving our
problems.

1957-season Sugar
“F.”: The Sugar Board was
scheduled to make a payment
of £l6 16s. a ton on January
25 on the balance of 1957
season’s “up-to-peak” sugar
remaining in store at that date,
on which no advance has
previously been made.
The advance on “up-tb-peak”
sugar undelivered will be
increased on February 22, to
£33 12s. a ton, and on March
29 to £44 2s. a ton.
Announcing these adjust-
ments of in-store advances, the
Queensland Minister for Agri-
culture pointed out that they
are somewhat earlier than last
season. Removals from North
Queensland ports to the end of
December had been about
190,000 tons more than in the
previous year. These increased
removals had consisted almost
entirely of exports; the large
sale to Japan for shipment
during the crushing-season had
materially assisted. These had
been the main factors making
the earlier advances possible ;
the situation would not neces-
sarily recur in future.
Late in February, considera-
tion will be given to making a
second interim payment about
the end of March. If this is
found possible, the final pay-
ment will, of course, be
correspondingly reduced.
So far no advance has been
announced in respect of 1957
season’s excess-sugar. How-
ever, it has now been arranged
that an advance of £24 10s.
a ton (less lighterage charges,
if any) will be made on
February 22 on excess-sugar
delivered to that date. Excess-
sugar delivered after that date
would receive a similar advance
on delivery.
The Sugar Board’s agents,
The Colonial Sugar Refining
Company, will be advising the
mills of further details regard-
ing these payments.
Super, with Seed
“Grantulla”: All arguments
about when and where super,
should be applied for the
wheat-crop have been settled
with recently-reported work by
Sims and Andrew of the Vic.
Department of Agriculture,
which shows that the fertiliser
should be placed with the
grain—normal practice—for
best results.
Topdressing the paddock
before seeding-time, or spread-
ing the manure over the crop,
were much inferior methods to
standard placement. In fact,
applying super, a month after
sowing was worse financially
than not putting on any super.,
as far as the crop itself was
concerned. It might have had
some benefit for the subsequent
pasture.
These results have import-
ant implications. The most
jmportant is the often-stressed
need for ordering super, early
enough to be put on with the
seed at sowing-time. If it
arrives earlier, it should be
stored until it is wanted, instead
of being put out. If it cotnes
too late, farmers have to make
up their minds whether to delay
seeding or go ahead without
super.
As late seeding usually means
reduced yields as well as the
lisk of not getting the crop
sown—as happened in two
recent wet winters —there is all
the more need for ordering
super, well in time for use. It
is better to be too early than
too late.
On the other hand, super.
can benefit pastures at all times
of the year.
Russian Comfrey
“Sevenelms”: A more
modest grower of Russian-
comfrey than “Van” (B.
22/1/-58), I got only weak
growth until it was covered with
two inches .of fowl-manure
and watered daily. The cater-
pillar plague left it unscathed,
but a north wind complement-
ing a 96-degree temperature
burnt all the leaf-tops. Its claim
to palatability was confirmed by
cows who normally look
askance at anything new —but
wolfed the comfrey immedi-
ately, stems and all. In view
of its characteristics, I am
intrigued by the Agricultural
Department’s apprehension that
it might grow beyond control.
Weed-control
“A.”: Trials in N.Z. in the
1956-57 season have confirmed
the value of using chemicals to
weed field-brassica crops,
particularly swedes and turnips,
and have emphasised that
onions are probably the most
difficult vegetable-crop to keep
free of weeds.
The trials showed that in
brassicas effective weed-control
depended largely on establish-
ing a good crop, so as to get
complete ground-cover as soon
as possible.
Of all the chemicals, brassicas
showed greatest tolerance to
T.C.A., and this may be used
at up to 201 b. an acre without
detriment to the crop.
However, this chemical must
be applied to moist soil, and is
most effective if rain follows the
application. Normally, it
should be applied as soon as
the crop is planted.
Another chemical, oktone,
gives good control if the crops
are drilled. After preparation
of the seed-bed the weeds
should be allowed to strike (lin.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(23/1/’58)
Most 'of Queensland will probably get only light to
moderate, patchy rain during February, although heavy rains
should occur on the Peninsula, north coast and part of the
Gulf Country. Heavy rains should continue on the north
coast and Peninsula during March.
Apart from moderate, patchy rains on the coast, rain-
fall in N.S.W. is likely to be poor during February. The
coast, northern and central tablelands, and part of the
central west should get moderate rain in March, but rainfall
will probably be poor elsewhere.
Poor rainfall over most of Victoria during February,
apart from moderate rain in portion 'of the central division.
All told, general rains are unlikely until May.
Rainfall probably poor in South Australia during
February, March and April, but general rains should com-
mence in the agricultural areas in May, with good rains in
the- interior during June.
Poor rainfall is also predicted in Western Australia
during February, apart from moderate rains in the north
Kimberleys. Good rains are likely in many areas during
March.

to 3in. high) and then the crop
drilled.
Oktone should then be
applied at 21b. to 41b. per acre,
in lOgals. to 15gals. of kerosene,
but not after the crop is
through the ground, otherwise
damage will occur. It is most
suitable for rape and chou-
moellier because of their thick
ground-cover.
The trials also showed that
no chemical is sufficiently
selective to give a long-term
control of weeds without
damage to onions. The search
for a chemical that has long
residual properties in the soil,
so that successive crops of
weeds are destroyed, still con-
tinues.
If the onion-crop is estab-
lished weed-free with contact-
chemicals such as oktone and
sulphuric-acid, the residual
chemicals like monuron and
C.I.P.C. can be applied with
greater safety, and their effects
may last several months.
Where resistant weeds are
present, hand-removal, or
control by directed sprays of
oktone, diesel-fuel-oil or sul-
phuric-acid will give a con-
siderable measure of control.
The ML tests made it clear
that unless cultivation benefits
the crop, the use of correct
weedkillers plus hand-removal
of any resistant weeds will give
better control than cultivation
alone in addition to removal of
row weeds.
Report from the
Wimmera
“Olym”: The “paper
drought” in the Victorian
Wimmera, so widely publicised
by sensation-loving city news-
papers—sympathy for our
supposed plight reached me, to
my amazement, from as far
away as western Queensland —
stirred considerale resentment
in the district, which suffered
in consequence a steep decline
in sheep-prices and more
Stringent restriction of bank-
credit to all primary-producers.
At the time of these reports
Wimmera crops had seldom
looked better.
Early harvest-reports coming
from various parts of this big
grain-growing district at time
of writing flatly contradict the
drought-stories. Oat-crops have
yielded from 60 to a record 81
bushels per acre, and wheat-
yields range from \2\ to 16
bags to the acre. Most of the
higher yields come from the
new variety, Olympic, though
one grower reports the old
favorite, Pinnacle, promises
him better results than his \2\-
bag crop of Olympic.
Fodder-beet
Quantities
“Billjim”: Fodder-beet is a
useful supplement in suitable
districts, but careful manage-
ment is necessary when it is fed
to cattle.
Fodder-beet poisoning is
usually caused by overfeeding.
Selection of suitable varieties
is important. For use in break-
feeding with an electric-fence,
the type needed is one which
does not grow too deeply and
which produces a big amount
of feed per acre, without having
a dangerously high dry-
matter content.
Under conditions at the
Ruakura Experimental Farm
(N.Z.), Red Otofte and Korsroe
were found to best fulfil these
requirements.
It was found that the maxi-
mum amount of such beets
which can safely be fed is about
401 b. per day for a Jersey cow,
and 601 b. for a Friesian, with
about 61b. a day for an adult
Romney ewe.
This amount must be reached
gradually, over two to three
weeks after feeding begins,
with 101 b. being allowed for
the first three days and 151 b.
for the next three, the quantity
being progressively increased to
the maximum during the
following week or two.
If varieties with a higher dry-
matter content than those men-
tioned are fed, the ration
should be reduced below that
recommended for these
varieties.
If trouble does occur, the
best thing to do is to break-
off feeding for a week or two,
and then reintroduce it with a
lower maximum intake.
Sheep are less prone to the
trouble, but where they are
affected relief can be given by
dosing with beet-juice.
Record Pig-litter
“J.”: A world-record of a
single litter of pigs weighing
more than 10001 b. at eight
weeks has been established on
a small pig-farm in East York-
shire, England.
The litter consisted of 18
piglets, ranging in liveweight
from 461 b. to 83|1b., giving a
total weight of 11341 b. at eight
weeks.
It was produced on the farm
of Mrs. Beatrice Revell, of
Seaton House Farm, Thorn-
gumbald, by a pure Essex sow,
and was sired by a Large White
boar.
According to the manager of
the farm, S. E. Nicholson, con-
stant care and careful feeding
were necessary during the early
life of the piglets to produce
this record litter.
Farrowing took place under
heat supplied by infra-red
lamps, and then the litter was
divided into two groups which
were allowed to suckle in turns.
During suckling, they also
received a diet of sow’s-milk
substitute.
On the third day the piglets
began receiving solid food in
the form of flaked maize and
fishmeal, with a supplement of
the antibiotic terramycin at the
rate of 71b. per ton.
At 12 days another freshly
farrowed sow was brought in as
a fostermother. The solid feed-
ing continued unchanged
through the remainder of the
eight weeks, except that the
terramycin antibiotic supple-
ment was increased to a rate of
l(Hlb. per ton.
Drought Lessons
“Bilwon”: The drought in
Queensland has probably pre-
pared the way for a few drastic
changes on dairyfarms here,
later on.
For a start, there will have
to be a new approach to
fodder-conservation. There is
a world of difference between
packing away a bit of fodder
for a short dry spell of, say,
two to three months, and con-
serving enough to last out a
drought.
Despite what many people
think, putting away several
hundred tons of silage is
mighty hard work. You can
raise a sweat without any
trouble putting the stuff in, but
you finish up in a lather getting
it out.
As the number of hands on
any one farm is limited, suc-
cessful silage-making depends
on the use of modern
machinery. You can make it
without this equipment, but the
hard work makes most shy off
it. That’s the reason why so
little is made.
The history of community
machinery-pools is a sorry one.
Take a community-header.
Everyone wants to take off the
crop at the one time. The
fellow who pulls the shortest
straw and has last use of the
machine is soured-off on
machinery-pools for ever more.

be if he loses most of his grain.
Yet a silage-making machine
0 n every farm is a bit expen-
sive and bumps-up costs. You
can’t afford to have a machine
idle for months on end. Silage-
making machinery offers the
greatest promise as far as a
community-pool is concerned.
Crops or pastures can be
ensiled over a fairly wide period
of time. It’s not an urgent job
like harvesting grain.
Thousands of words have
been spilled on paper detailing
the virtues of the different types
of silos, overground and
underground. The picture is
becoming fairly clear as far as
this State is concerned.
For the big drought, put the
silage in deep trenches and
leave it there until it’s wanted.
It may be under the ground
tor years, but that won’t hurt
it if it is properly covered. One
deep trench, down for 10 years,
was recently opened. The
silage was as good as the day
it went in.
The aboveground types, bun,
wedge, clamp, and the shallow
underground trench, are strictly
short - term projects. This
doesn’t mean they have no
place on the farm. Hardly a
year passes without one or
more dry months when the
stock have to be hand-fed.
That’s the time 30 to 50 tons
of silage come in handy. That
is also the ideal size for these
silos.
It just doesn’t pay to hack
out a deep trench, put in 200
tons of silage, then several
months later feed part of it out
and waste the rest.
The future pattern for silage
seems to be, say, 50-ton jobs
either above ground or in very
shallow trenches, with the deep
trench holding up to 200 tons
for the big drought that comes
around every seven to 10 years.
This doesn’t rule-out the hay-
shed. But you can run into
strife if you depend on hay
alone. In a very good season,
the very time you start to
build-up the reserves, thousands
of bales of hay go to waste
because of the wet weather.
It is impossible to get it dry
enough to cart into the shed.
Provided the machinery doesn’t
bog, you can make silage in any
weather. I once saw a silo
filled on the Atherton Table-
land in the middle of the wet
season. It rained solidly for a
week, but that silage opened up
as sweet as a nut. Hay and
silage are the ideal for any
dairyfarm.
Anyone who has an irriga-
tion-plant and lashings of water
is on the pig’s back just now.
But a lot of research is needed
before we know all there is to
know about our water-supplies.
It isn’t much consolation to
have an irrigation-plant only to
find the creek or well has
petered-out. Much has already
been done on water-research,
and the outlay has been
recouped many times over.
There are hundreds of farms
all over the State that could be
irrigated if the water position
were fully understood. Dams
across creeks and rivers, and
test-bores to find the natural
and permanent water - levels,
will do much to make irriga-
tion widespread throughout the
State. The result will mean a
continuous supply of fodder
and dairy-produce in a time
when it is most needed.
It is easy enough to blame
the farmer for not doing this or
that. But there’s his point of
view. If a job takes too much
labor, it may be impossible for
two reasons. It may not pay,
or labor may not be available.
If it doesn’t pay, that auto-
matically rules-out the scheme.
It it is very hard work, it may
be impossible to get labor to
c'o the job. The only way to
keep the young chaps on the
land these days is to make work
as light and as interesting as
possible.
That is one reason why
silage-making machinery will
have to come to the front more
than it has in the past. If it is
too expensive for the average
small dairyfarm, then a
machine among a group of
friendly farmers seems to be
the shot. Or possibly a
machine which does the job
on contract, like the familiar
hay-baler.
It will take time to spread
these ideas around the place,
but they must come if the
industry is to survive. This
drought will have cost some so
much that they will be years
paying it off. No business can
afford that. The banks and
business-houses could show
more interest in fodder-con-
servation. The money from
old Strawberry helps to keep
their doors open, so it’s part of
their business. Co-operative
dairy associations could do a
great deal, too. One company
in Queensland has done much
for the farmer in this respect,
and perhaps other companies
will follow the good example.
Fodder - conservation has
been talked about since Phillip
first stepped out of the cutter.
Every drought has brought
mental promises never to be
caught again. But this one
shows how short are our
memories. What is needed is
less talk and more action.
Most farmers would conserve
fodder if they had the equip-
ment.
A W.O.W. Week
“Sniper”: Horsham, capital
of Victoria’s Wimm e r a,
deserves a pat on the back for
planning to highlight its district
produce in a Wheat, Oats and
Wool (W.0.W.) Week early in
March.
Grafton has its famous
Jacaranda Festival, and
Ballarat its Begonia Festival,
but few Australian cities stop
to pay tribute to the products
which keep them on the map.
Americans exploit this sort of
occasion as a promotion
medium, and their Dairy Week,
featuring the selection of the
Maids of Milk in small com-
munities, and, finally, in Dairy-
ing States, is an excellent plug
for milk and butter in a land
where margarine is a big threat.
But apart from odd cases,
such as Ouyen in the Victorian
Mallee, which names its high-
school houses and trotting-races
after locally-grown wheats,
most districts are contented to
honor their primary produce
only on show day, when the
sideshows often get as much
attention as the exhibits.
In addition to its W.O.W.
Week, Horsham’s other activi-
ties include a big wheat-quality
contest, farm-competitions, and
a wool-classing school.
Farm Hints
“Billjim”: Pigs that are not
kept cool during the summer
grow slowly and use moie
food for each lb. of body-
weight gained. Pens should be
shaded, and if there isn’t a
bath-type wallow, run water
over the concrete floor.
“Prima”: If buying valuable
poultry for stock purposes, a
simple test to check leg weak-
nesses is to stand the bird on
a table or flat board and press
down on its back. If leg forma-
tion is unsound, the bird will
quickly go down. If the legs
are sound it will successfully
resist strong, pressure.

black lace mounted on pink taffeta was
topped with a white Arctic-fox cape. Mrs.
George Eckert (whose husband produced
this musical) chose a lovely sheath-frock
of deep-cream guipure-lace. Jennie
Brennan’s frock was a gold sheath in an
all-over design of tiny gold beads and
pearls.

For her wedding with Dr. Graeme
Harrison Neilson at Ail Souls’ Church,
Sandringham, Diana, daughter of Mrs.
U. Tyrwhitt Drake, of Geelong, and the
late Mr. Drake, chose a bouffant gown
of opalescent-magnolia pleated-tulle, with
a tight-fitting bodice. Orange-blossom
held the Limerick-lace heirloom veil, and
she carried a bouquet of magnolias. Mrs.
Henry Hopkins attended her sister, her
frock of aqua tulle having a bouffant
skirt and a fitted bodice finished with a
taffeta bow. Matching the bow was her
head-dress of ruched taffeta. The ’groom,
who is the only son of Mr. and Mrs.
N. H. Neilson, of Brisbane, had Dr.
Austin Doyle as best man. Reception
was at the Hotel Windsor.

The Italian ship Neptunia was the
setting for a dinner-dance arranged by
the Italian Auxiliary of the Royal
Children’s Hospital, which benefited from
the proceeds. Flags, and bowls of flowers
in red, white and blue shadings were used
in the decorations. Cocktails were served
in the lounge to the 130 guests before
dinner was taken in the dining-saloon;
afterwards there was dancing in the
lounge and on deck. The Marchese
Serafini (Consul-General for Italy) and
the Marchesa Serafini received the guests
with auxiliary-president Signora N.
Borsari. The Marchesa chose a lovely
waltz-length dress of white Chantilly-lace
and tulle, the full skirt finished with a
frill of tulle. A white Chantilly-lace frock
was also chosen by Signora Borsari, hers
featuring an Empire-line bodice defined
with a sash of white duchesse-satin. Also
at the official table were Neptunia’s
master (Captain E. Descovich), the
president of the central auxiliary of the
hospital (Mrs. A. J. Mclntosh) and her
husband, and Miss Carmen Winter,
organiser of the hospital’s auxiliaries.
Members of the Italian community
present included Signor and Signora
Mario Vigano, the latter’s lovely gown of
silver-grey brocade having a floating
back-panel lined with olive-green taffeta.
Signor and Signora Vigano will lend their
lovely home at South Morang and pro-
vide a sumptuous luncheon shortly to
aid the funds of the Royal Children’s
Hospital.

At a cocktail-party held in the board-
room of the Queen Victoria Hospital,
Dame Mabel Brookes, the hospital’s
president, announced that when the
Queen Mother visited the hospital on
March 1 there would be 2000 nurses in
attendance. That evening a debutante-
ball will be held in the Royale Ballroom
in aid of the Q.V.’s appeal for £lOO,OOO.
Dame Mabel hoped that some members
of the Royal party would attend. Mrs.


John Mulholland, one of the Queen
Mother’s ladies-in-waiting, is chairman
of the Elizabeth Garrett Hospital in
London, which is a counterpart of the
Queen Victoria in that it is run exclusively
by,women for women. Also in aid of
the appeal will be a gala-premiere of
“Rhythm Express,” starring Shirley
Bassey, at the Tivoli on February 12,
when the Governor and Lady Brooks,
the Premier and Mrs. Bolte and the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress will be
present.
SYDNEY
The nobility and gentry seem to be
blowing in and out of Sydney so rapidly
at the moment it is quite difficult to keep
track, especially while fixing the eyes on
Debrett at the same time. The English
P.M. and Lady Dorothy Macmillan are
here, of course, and the Orsova’s
passenger-list included Lord and Lady
Elton (he is secretary of the Rhodes
Trust, Oxford), the Princess Melikoff
(who is travelling with her sister, Mrs.
Walsh) and the Duke and Duchess of
Sutherland. Invitations for the garden-
party in honor of the Queen Mother are
out, and there is a great sale for white-
kid gloves.

In such an atmosphere it is harmonious
to hear that there is a school of deport-
ment in Melbourne where one may learn
Court etiquette, including “the plain bob,
the half-curtsy, the full-curtsy,” and also
“The art of sitting and walking up and
down stairs.” Melbourne is too far to go
for a full-curtsy lesson, so the plain
bob will have to do this Letter, though
if there were a course in walking back-
wards downstairs while wearing bifocals
it might be worth the trip.

The most dynamic visitor of the week
was Lady Baden-Powell, here after having
“done” (as they call it) four States of
Australia, her visit coinciding with the
100th anniversary of the birth of her late
husband, founder of the Boy Scouts and
Girl Guides. The scouts and guides now
number nearly 11| million and are spread
throughout the world, though not behind
the Iron Curtain. It is Lady Baden-
Powell’s life-work to bring together in
the movement all guides, whether they
live in Chile, Israel, Korea, Brazil or
Australia.
“I have a dual personality, though not
a split one,” Lady Baden-Powell told a
gathering of journalists during the week.
“For six months of the year I perch in
England and travel about Great Britain
and Europe. Then from October to
April I travel farther afield, to the U.S.,
Africa and now Australia, so I have a
responsibility to other countries as well
as my own.” Considering the tightness of
her schedule in Australia and the fact
that what she calls “that lovely little item
called ‘rest time’ ” is spent in writing
letters home, it is amazing to note how
much vitality can be contained in one
person. “I’ve been doing this for forty
years, so I suppose I’m hardened,” said
Lady Baden-Powell, who is proud of her
cast-iron constitution, and avers that she
is thoroughly fit again after the operation
that recently put her out of action for a
few weeks.

The farewell luncheon given by the
Royal Commonwealth Society (late
Royal Empire) in honor of the Hon.
Howard Beale, Australia’s new Ambassa-
dor to Washington, and Mrs. Beale was
mighty well attended, and those who
went along heard a delightful talk from
Mr. Beale. Mr. Norman Jenkyn, in his
introduction, hesitated to refer to the
guest-of-honor as “a politician” and
substituted “a member of the political
scene,” and Mr. Beale commented that
“no one can be called a statesman in
Australia until he is dead.” He paid a
warm tribute to his wife and the help
she had given him in his career. As he
added that there are 83 Embassies in
Washington (work that out in terms of
social occasions!), it seems that she will
be called upon for a good deal more in
the helpmate role. Mr. Beale’s affirma-
tion that he hoped to interpret the Aus-
tralian people just as they are to the
Americans, including their language and
accent, brought laughter. “The Ameri-
can has his way of mangling the English
language and we have ours,” he said.
“But we are a British people proud of
the fact that we are members of the
British Commonwealth, and Americans,
too, have the same heritage.”
It has been a lively week for first-
nights. The Independent opened with
“The Member of the Wedding,” a most
moving play, beautifully acted. American
Vice-Consul James Dougherty and Mrs.
Dougherty were present at this opening,
also Mr. and Mrs. Joyce, of the U.S.
Information Office, the Mayor of North
Sydney and the Deputy-Mayor. It was
announced during the week, too, that
actor Noel Madison has returned to
Sydney to produce four important plays
for the Independent, the first being “The
View from the Bridge,” by Arthur
Miller, which will be this theatre’s pro-
duction after Tennessee Williams’s “Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof.”
“Salad Days” at the Elizabethan played
on the opening night to a bright and
well-dressed audience. It was noted that
theatre-cloaks seem to be coming back.
Mrs. Nancy Walton wore a full-length
one of fine white lace over black to
match her slim dress; Mrs. Marcel
Dekyvere’s cloak was of citron-yellow
silk-honan ; Mrs. J. K. Schartl’s shorter
coat of white satin patterned in rich
Chinese colors had been specially woven
in Hong Kong. There was a good
sprinkling of young people in the
audience, among them Mr. and Mrs.
John Hurley’s daughters Diana and Anne.
It must be admitted that the hair-dos in
the audience —the puffed wings, the
decorated buns, the flower-cuts, etc. —
were much more interesting than the
long, curly bobs of the girls in the show.
“Salad Days” is thoroughly, thoroughly
English in atmosphere, and somehow
fits-in with the nobility-and-gentry wave
that is sweeping through the city.
Sorcar the magician provided another
first-night for the week (the Genesians'
revival of their success “Our Town” a
fourth). One of Sorcar’s tricks is to have
himself efficiently blindfolded and then
read what members of the audience write
on a blackboard and to draw pictures on
it himself. During this trick a woman-
across-the-aisle kept saying, “There's no
trick in it, really, you know, because he’s
got X-ray eyes.” And, “That’s all
gammoning, that tripping over things. He
can see. He’s got X-ray eyes. There’s no
trick, really!” How he came to acquire
the X-ray eyes didn’t puzzle her; and she
quite failed to realise she was a bit of a
trick herself.

Captain Audrey Webb, R.A.A.N.C.,
who lives at Killara, has been appointed
to the Commonwealth staff of the Queen
Mother as nursing-sister during her
Majesty’s Australian tour. After having
trained at Sydney's Royal Alexandra
Hospital for Children, Capt. Webb spent
a year nursing in England ; in 1953 she
joined the Royal Australian Army Nurs-
ing Corps, being stationed at Ingleburn
and Kapooka. There followed 14 months
in Japan at the British Commonwealth
General Hospital, Kure. Lately she has
been serving as tutor-Sister at the School
of Army Health at Healesville (Vic.).


the South China Sea, the
Macassar Strait and Molucca
passage aimed at the strategic
points which it was intended to
capture in southern Sumatra,
Dutch Borneo, the Celebes,
Amboina, Timor and New
Guinea apart from the main-
land.
Upon the completion of this
phase, which it was planned to
achieve within a hundred days
after the first attack, the third
phase was to commence—
simultaneous attacks on the
eastern and western ends of
Java ; the occupation of
northern Sumatra ; and the in-
vasion of Burma.
These operations were to
mark the end of what might
be called the conquest phases.
Their timetable covered 150
days. Thus it was to be com-
plete roughly by the end of
April, 1942. The crucial opera-
tion was the surprise at Pearl
Harbor ; success there removed
the only obstacle to the
carrying-out of the timetable.
The Japanese plan accepted
on November 5 stressed
this factor, thus clearly explain-
ing the naval nature of the war
and its particular urgencies in
regard to speed so that resources
in oil and other materials would
be available when needed.
When this 150-day pro-
gramme was completed a
second period would be entered-
up: to strengthen the walls of
the cordon, by filling-in the
interstices by capture of such
areas as the southern coast of
New Guinea, Moresby, etc.,
Nicobars and the Andamans,
the mopping-up of Burma, as
far as the Irrawaddy, the
immobilisation of the British
bases in Ceylon and others
which might threaten from
immediately without, such as
Darwin, the securing of
ascendancy in the Bay of
Bengal and in the Timor Sea.
Generally it seems to have
been intended that this would
close the operations of 1942
while consolidation and
organisation took place inside
the defence-cordon, of which
the final perimeter would run
south-west from the northern
end of the Kuriles in sight of
Kamchatka to Tarawa and
Makin Islands on the outer
edge of the Gilberts, thence
south-east round the whole
of the East Indies and
up the Burmese border embra-
cing Akyab, and running north
from there. A screen was to be
built southward shielding Aus-
tralian routes to America.
Allied Weaknesses
TN carrying out their plan the
Japanese had advantages
such as no modern nation with
its immense naval and military
resources had ever before had
in such a situation.
The only great sea-nation of
Europe which normally might
have interfered with their plans
was already so locked in a
battle of the sea-routes that it
could not throw its forces,
naval or military or air,
eastward in anything like
sufficient quantities to inter-
fere —certainly not within the
ambit of the Japanese time-
table.
The United States was
totally surprised and not
inured to war, naive and
inexperienced at that stage,
despite the huge clamor of its
press against the inefficiency of
everybody else. It was almost
as naive and unorganised as
was the Australian Govern-
ment, which was soon disa-
greeing with every Ally and
begging at one moment that 25
divisions should be sent pronto
because Australia was the most
important spot of earth ;
the next trumpeting that
it would send reinforce-
ments (which it hadn’t got) to
Malaya, and demanding that
the South-west Pacific Com-
mand (with resources) should
be committed to its care and
that it be allowed to carry out
its plan of sending a couple of
light carriers and some cruisers
to attack the coasts of Japan
immediately and blow the
Japanese cities to pieces.
The Americans were sur-
veyed by the British representa-
tive, Field-Marshal Dill, three
weeks after the Pacific war
broke out:
Never have I seen a country so
utterly unprepared for war and so
soft.
Even the President, who was
Commander-in-Chief, had no
war-secretariat and no regular
private secretary:
The lack of system existed right
through the Government machine.
The Navy and Army acted as
independent powers, often pursuing
diametrically opposite courses. When
the United States Joint Chiefs-of-
Staff —hastily formed on the British
model—met their counterparts at
their first combined meeting there
was not even an agenda or anyone
responsible for taking the minutes.
— Alanbrooke.
They held no regular meet-
ings. They had no joint
planners or executive planning-
staff :
At present this country [wrote
Lord Alanbrooke] has not —repeat
not —the slightest conception of what
war means and their armed forces
are more unready for war than it
is possible to imagine. Eventually
they will do great things, but the
difficulty is goiqg to be to hold
cards of re-entry to enable them to
play their strong • suits when they
have collected them The whole
organisation belongs to the days of
George Washington, wjio was made
Commander-in-Chief of all the
Forces and just did it. Today the
President is Commander-in-Chief of
all the Forces, but it is not so easy
to do it.
Nevertheless, brainchild of
General Marshall, the U.S.
Chiefs -of - Staff immediately
came up with an immense
unworkable plan, world-wide,
in which the South-west
Pacific Command was to
figure under the A.8.D.A.,
to comprise everything
within the scope of the
Japanese cordon, but separated
from its natural supply-bases,
Australia and India, and hold-
ing a front 4000 miles long—a
vast muddled dream. It was
proposed that this task, obvi-
ously impossible, should be
given to an Englishman, while
the Americans did the planning
and supplied what resources
they could.
Field-Marshal Dill wrote to
General Alan Brooke that it
would be “fatal to have a
British commander responsible
for the disasters that are coming
to the Americans as well as
ourselves.”
General Brooke’s Plan
YAET, at the same time this
jerry - built arrangement
was being cooked-up in
Washington, the British were
being blamed in Australia
for inventing it.
Brooke, the new C.I.G.S. in
London, was trying to get
order into British thinking,
which was only just emerging
from a period in which its
policy was piecemeal.
He had just formulated the
concept that the only way to
wrest initiative from the
Germans was to concentrate
on the one point where
geographical circumstances did
not favor the Germans —i.e.,
North Africa —beat him totally
there, clear the Mediterranean
sea-routes and pave the way to
invade southern Europe, again
at points most inconvenient to
the enemy in view of British
superior naval strength and the
weakness of the Germans in
their Allied and occupied
countries.
They were just being
heartened by the early descent
of winter on Hitler’s armies in
Russia, enabling the Russians
to turn back the German
offensive from Moscow. Then
the news reached London not
only that the Japanese were on
the way to Malaya, but of the
Pearl Harbor raid and the
destruction of General
MacArthur’s Air Force, left
lying in the open Clark field
in spite of due warning of the
Japanese moves —Manila had
been blacked-out for a month.
So the U.S. Pacific Fleet could
not, as had been expected, in
the event of the outbreak
of war, advance to help in the
Malayan and East Indian area.
Time and Trouble
the loss of the com-
mand of the sea in the
East Indian seas and Pacific
Ocean anything that could be
done in the area against
Japanese movements could
merely gain time while
Churchill went to Washington
and concerted plans of re-entry
which would follow organisa-
tion of British forces and
American plans and forces.
Three days after the Prime
Minister sailed, six British and
Canadian battalions in Hong
Kong, without air-cover or
naval support, were faced with
attack by the Japanese 38th
Division, plus an infantry
regiment, plus artillery and
co-operation from the First
Air Brigade and the China
Area Fleet.
Almost at the same time,
when Brooke was rightly
estimating that Hong Kong
could not hold out a fortnight,
nor Singapore a month, the
loss of the Prince of Wales and
Repulse added to a series of
naval disasters which cost the
Royal Navy nearly as many
capital-ships as the U.S. lost at
Pearl Harbor some only
temporarily.
The R.N. lost Barham, Ark
Royal, Prince of Wales and
Repulse, and then Queen
Elizabeth and Valiant were
holed in Alexandria Harbor
by Italian frogmen.
British and Americans to-
gether had lost 15 capital ships
in a month, or nearly half
their battle-line strength in all
oceans. Malta was being
ground to powder by a
German Air Corps withdrawn
from Russia. All that was left
of the British sea-forces in the
Mediterranean was three
cruisers and a few destroyers
and the empty harbor of Malta,
round which the battle raged
in the air.
The relief of Tobruk, which
opened the way for Auchinlcck


to advance, was discounted by
the flood of demands from
Canberra and Singapore,
which both seemed to believe
that the fate of the world
hinged round the immediate
saving of Malaya, *of which,
in effect, the fate was already
settled.
The British command
admitted the importance of
Singapore because, if it should
go, the Middle East and
possibly India might follow
suit in due course. The Aus-
tralian Government demanded
the return of the Australian
“Funny the way they scoot every time that bell rings.”
divisions from the Middle East,
which would have doomed
Auchinleck’s offensive against
Rommel.
The latter, with his convoy-
routes freed in the Mediter-
ranean, was rebuilding his
forces through Tripoli with
such success that in three weeks
be recovered nearly all the
ground which the British had
gained in the Christmas fight-
ing.
Hong Kong had gone before
Christmas, and the Japanese
had bottled-up MacArthur’s
Philippine Army iri the Bataan
Peninsula. In January the over-
running of Malaya went
according to plan Japanese
plan.
The formation allotted for
this purpose was the 25th Army
—lmperial Guards Division,
slh and 18th divisions (with the
56th Division in reserve in
Japan) and the 3rd Air
Division—backed by as much
as was needed of the Southern
Naval Force, which included a
battle-squadron headed by two
battleships, two light fleet
carriers, four cruiser-squadrons
(including 11 eight-inch cruisers
and three light-cruisers), four
destroyer-squadrons (made up
of four light-cruisers and 52
destroyers) and three sub-
marine-flotillas totalling 18
submarines,
Available for co-operation
with this was the 22nd Air
Fleet—the Air Forces involved
in the area directly concerned
with Singapore and scarcely
resistant North Borneo totalled
about 350 aircraft.
It would have been
impossible to picture a more
gloomy or hopeless situation,
with the whole of the eyes of
the sensational press of the
world pinpointing Singapore
and using it as a stick to beat
the British in particular,
Yet at that moment, with the
help of the experienced Dill,
one of the best military
planners of the age, the
President of the U.S. and
Churchill were calmly crossing
the “t’s” in the “Victory” pro-
gramme which was announced
early in the January, when
things seemed at their blackest,
and which envisaged the pro-
duction of 45,000 aircraft,
45.000 tanks, 20,000 anti-air-
craft guns, 15,000 anti-tank
guns and 500,000 machine-guns,
plus 8,000,000 tons of shipping,
within the year, and double
these quantities of military sup-
plies and 10,000,000 tons of
shipping in 1943. This apart
from the United Kingdom’s
almost unbelievable output
under circumstances of equally
unbelievable difficulty.
Defence, even hopeless
defence, of any point which
might delay or disorganise in
the slightest degree the smooth
working of the highly com-
plicated Japanese plan, was
needed to gain time till the
English-speaking allies were
ready to administer to the
enemy, with . overwhelming
force, what Churchill in his
Christmas broadcast called “a
lesson which they and the
world will never forget.”
Losses Evaluated
SINGAPORE’S fall, with the
loss of 138,000 men (of
whom 38,000 were British and
18,000 Australians) and large
sources of material, was cer-
tainly a heavy setback which
moved everybody, from
Churchill downwards, at the
time, to extravagant cries of
“disaster,” some of them (in
his case) calculated and pur-
poseful, designed as a spur to
effort rather than as a just state-
ment of fact.
These judgments are still
being repeated by both Aus-
tralian and British historians,
with a sort of hypnotised
certainty.
But in the perspective of
history they certainly seem
exaggerated, especially when
the events of the area early in
1942 are regarded as a cul-
mination.
They were in fact only one
black spot on which the lime-
light was focused, in a month
in which the Malta convoy
seemed likely to fail, the
Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst
were able to pass up the English
Channel under the noses of the
Coastal Command of the
R.A.F. and the English guns,
the British forces were hurriedly
retreating in Cyrenaica and the
German advance threatened
Cairo, and shipping was being
lost at sea at the rate of nearly
700,000 tons a month —trans-
port for 10 divisions —in the
submarine war.
It meant much more that the
sinkings in the Atlantic
endangered the lifeline with
America than that Japan had
for the time being the
resources of the Indies —which,
incidentally, she probably
would have captured to time-
table even if the island of
Singapore had held out.
Singularly enough, in spur-
ring the Combined Chief s-of-
Staff organisation to instant
action and American industry
to swift changeover to a war
basis, Pearl Harbor and the
events of Singapore actually
accelerated the growth of Allied
strength and the turn of the
tide.
Like another defeat, that of
Greece and Crete, regarded as
a senseless sacrifice by many,
the events of December-March,
1941-42, served a good
purpose.
TT is now clear from the
analysis of General
Guderian that the delay caused
to the Germans by the
unexpected British resistances
ot the Greek and Balkan
campaigns was one of the two
great influences which set the
timing of the German attack
on Russia later than it might
have been, and therefore
brought down the winter and
assured their failure to reach
their 1941 objectives.
The essential test of Japanese
success in the South-east Asian
area was not whether they had
captured the resources of that
area, which in any case it would
have been difficult for her
enemies to use in the face of
an extreme temporary
shipping shortage and the
existence of a powerful
Japanese Air Force and Navy,
but whether she herself would
be able to use them to the full.
And time proved that this was
a cat of another color
altogether.


the big buses and the little Vespas
and the Alfa-Romeos and the
terrified pedestrians as if they were
a Mozart minuet. There is even a
prize for footwork. In most places,
and especially in Rome, they are very
popular; at Epiphany everybody
gives them presents, and they stand
bowing and flicking and waving and
undulating amid piles of fruit and
cakes and bottles of wine. If they
see a pretty girl driving a big car
they will get down, put their heads
in the window and exclaim “Brava!
Bella! Bellissima!” If it is a friend
of theirs they will get down and
shake hands.
It is not a book about traffic-cops,
but about the famous and prolonged
scandal, from 1953 to 1957, which
began when the dead body of a
carpenter’s daughter was found on a
beach near Rome. The scandal grew
to such proportions that the Foreign
Minister and the Chief of Police were
forced to resign; three prominent men
—the son of a former Foreign Minister,
the head of the Rome police and the
Marquis of San Bartolomeo —were put
on. trial; the Government tottered and
riot and revolution came very close:
something like the Dreyfus affair.
But the great interest and entertain-
ment-value of the story, apart from
what light it throws on a mystery which
will probably never be solved, is its
picture of the administration of justice
in Italy, which has all the gaiety, all
the seeming abandonment and all the
peril of the direction of the traffic.
The great differences between the
Italian courts (based on the Code
Napoleon) and our own are, firstly, the
admission of hearsay evidence;
secondly, the “confrontation” of wit-
nesses so that any who disagree have
fo argue it out together in public; and
'thirdly, of course, the exuberance of
temperament which pervades the whole
proceedings. Over thirty counsel, most
of them merely with “watching briefs”
for people only remotely connected
with the accused, but by no means
limited merely to silently watching,
crowded into the Montesi trial:—
Italian counsel in court wear a
gown like a Master of Arts and a
cascade of gold on their shoulders
like a Flag-Lieutenant, and carry a
little baton like a Field-Marshal. To
see them all standing and shouting
during a good row and waving their
gowns (“agitating their togas” in
Italian) like so many angry ravens
was a very satisfying spectacle.
The case, full of drama throughout,
was also much enlivened by the
evidence of two “wizards,” one of
whom had spoken for hardly ten
minutes when he was committed to
prison for perjury.
As to what it was all about, it is
very doubtful if anybody, in the end,
really knew. The only unassailable
facts were that the girl’s body was
found on the beach; and that, if the
medical evidence was accepted, she
had been drowned and had not been
assaulted. The whole thing blew-up
when Communist newspapers, to
embarrass the Government when an
election was pending, started to print
rumors that she had been murdered by
the son of the former Foreign Minister
and that the authorities, to protect him,
were trying to conceal the crime. The
likeliest explanation despite the
impassioned and contradictory evidence
of “the Caglio,” an ex-mistress of the
Marquis of San Bartolomeo—is simply
that Wilma Montesi committed suicide.
That, apparently, was the first
thought of her parents, who, the night
she disappeared, at once went out to
search the banks of the Tiber and a
convenient well; and, even from the
Caglio or the wizards, there never was
any acceptable evidence that she had
been murdered. The former Foreign
Minister’s son. charged with murder,
was acquitted; the other two accused,
charged with “conspiracy” to conceal
the crime, were also acquitted . . . After
three years of magnificent uproar the
only practical result was that half-a-
dozen obscure witnesses served brief
terms for perjury.
But perhaps, too, as Wayland Young
suggests, another result was achieved:
a Communist revolution was averted:
the public being at once entertained by
the trial and persuaded that a clean-up
of corruption in high places was being
accomplished.
Young, who was the “Observer”
correspondent in Rome, could have
made a better book of it by taking the
whole affair in hand and making an
ordered summary; but as a day-to-day
account this is still, if more than a
little confusing, both diverting and
enlightening. And possibly a really
satisfying summary could only be
made with further, quite unprocurable
evidence, and in the light of a theory
which Young is not anxious to press
too far.
Wild Times at Woop Woop
England, Australia, a tanker in the
Red Sea, murder, Communist agents,
love, betrayal and an unforgiving
adolescent —all these are to be found
in Whistle and I’ll Come, by Philip
McCutchan (Harrap).
The hero is the Scottish second
officer of a tanker on the Red Sea; he
thoughtlessly chokes a greaser who
has managed to get drunk and is
smoking a cigarette, and for this he is
sentenced to jail in England, after
which, having been abandoned by his
wife, he ships as a seaman to Aus-
tralia, where a Communist member of
the crew shows him how to desert in
Sydney. There is some detailed
evidence of how he is managed by a
Communist organisation ashore; pass-
port, new identity, boarding-house
specially adapted for a deserter to hide
until he is forgotten.
The hero decides to throw-off the
Communist gang; he gets himself a
job in an Italian cafe in King’s Cross
to such effect that the Italian pro-
prietor, going abroad, leaves him to
run it as a partner. But here the head
Communist steps in and orders the
hero to buy a Woop Woop pub. where
he makes love to the chambermaid, is
made much of by the draper and
discovers that the draper’s wife’s
previous husband was the man the
hero strangled aboard ship, while her
son, whom the hero likes so much that
he is going to send him to Sydney
University to be a doctor, is the son
of his victim. And then the Commo.
chieftain tells the hero to kill the
draper, who is an ardent anti-
communist . . .
Maybe Australia isn’t so dull a place
as we think it is.
New Zealand Survey
Of 150 New Zealand books published
in 1957 (including thirty published
overseas) there are fifteen biographies,
twenty-two works of fiction, eight of
N.Z. history, five on art, five on aspects
of Maori culture—including a new and
revised (6th) edition of Williams’s
Dictionary —six on natural history, two
on World War 11, four books of literary
essays and criticism, eleven of travel
and exploration, three books for
children, four on economics and
sociology, two on pure science, one on
geophysics (Earthquakes, by G. A.
Eiley), two on education, three books
of plays and one of dramatic criticism
and no less than ten of poetry, all by
established poets.
Among the biographies are Mr.
Explorer (C. E. Douglas), by John
Pascoe, and The World Regained, by
R. D. McEldowney. Of the novels,
the most important would seem to be
Owls Do Cry, by Janet Frame, who,
in the opinion of this writer, might very
well have qualified for-the mantle of
Katherine Mansfield. The most popular
will certainly be The Unwritten Book
and Dinner Doesn’t Matter, by Mary
Scott, the bright and amusing author
of the best-seller Breakfast at Six, which
this year goes into a German edition.
Notable among the art-books are the
beautifully turned-out Engravings on
Wood, by E. M. Taylor, and an
interesting study of The Maori as
Artist, by Pandovan Renzo. In the
history list there are W. P. Morrell’s
History of N.Z. Life, and an excellent
new edition of John Gorst’s The Maori


STEAK FOR BREAKFAST
By O’Conner
Here is a picture of outback life that is both hilarious and true. The cattle
station in the Gulf Country, where Bess O’Conner’s husband had been appointed
manager, was all a new world to her, and the characters she met there make
as entertaining a collection as one could find anywhere. The feeling that these
are real people and real happenings make it a pleasure to share the life of the
O’Conners and their friends —and there is always steak for breakfast!

WILLIAM COLLINS OVERSEAS LIMITED
33 York Street, Sidney
King, edited by Dr. Keith Sinclair,
Senior Lecturer in History at Auckland
University College, who himself will
shortly publish a work on the causes
of the Maori Wars. Theatre in Danger,
consisting of correspondence on the
condition of the N.Z. drama, between
Bruce Mason and John Pocock, is an
interesting contribution to dramatic
criticism. J. McNeish’s Tavern in the
Town is an amusing treatise on the N.Z.
hotel.
The poetry includes W. H. Oliver’s
Fire Without Phcenix, Denis Glover’s
Since Then and Sings Harry, Louis
Johnson’s New World For Old and
Charles Brasch’s Estate. The publishers
of these volumes have maintained their
high standard of craftsmanship.
One of the most satisfactory achieve-
ments of N.Z. writing is the continued
production of “Landfall,” the literary
quarterly edited by Charles Brasch and
published by the Caxton Press, with
the assistance of the N.Z. Literary
Fund. In the March, 1957, issue it
published six very good “Translations
of Maori Songs and Chants,” by
Openheimer and Curnow. The
December number contains an “Aus-’
tralian Letter” by Tom Inglis Moore,
a sensitively written story, “Flowers on
the Table,” by James Courage, and
reviews by H. Winston Rhodes, Frank
Sargeson, Deirdre Airey, D. M.
Anderson and others.

John Grant’s Journey
All who have read the recently
published convict narrative, John
Grant’s Journey, will agree with
Malcolm Ellis (B. 25/12/’57) that even
in its present garbled form it is a
historical find of the first importance.
However, Mr. Ellis, before Grant’s
letters and journals are available in an
easily accessible and complete form,
is inclined to doubt many of Grant’s
statements.
For'instance, he describes “Bridget
Doulan” as an “Irish colleen of whom
there is no historic trace.” He even
infers that she might be a fictitious
character created by Grant to form
the basis of a colonial romance.
But this is far from fact. “Bridget
Doulan” was real in the person of
Winifred Dowling, who, with her sister
Eliza, was sentenced to life-transporta-
tion for a political offence at the
Kildare sessions of. 1801 and came to
the colony on the transport Atlas
together with the impetuous Irish
knight Henry Brown Hayes.
As can be expected, it was not long
before Winifred E)owling found a suit-
able husband in Francois Duriault, one
of two French prisoners-of-war sent
out to the colony to instruct the settlers
in the arts of viticulture. They were
married at Parramatta on September
17, 1802.
Later, it would seem, Duriault lent
tacit support to the convict uprising
of 1804. This was much against his
wife’s wishes and judgment. Accord’
ing to a statement by Joseph Holt
recorded elsewhere, she told Duriault
“.... if she saw any more whispering
or anything suspicious she would quit
the place, for by such means the
misfortunes of her family as well as
those of Ireland were occasioned.” The
upshot was that Governor King classed
the Frenchman as a trouble-maker and
bundled him out of the colony on the
H.M.S. Calcutta. Nothing more is
heard of him.
Thus the stage is set for a lonely
grass-widow in her humble hut outside
Parramatta when the engaging young
convict, John Grant, appears from a
neighboring farm. His narrative reveals
the long—and, it seems, unavailing—
pursuit for her affections, his tender
thoughts when he was far away at
Norfolk Island, and the agony of
disappointment when he returned to
Sydney and heard that she had been
pardoned and left the colony. We see
a saddened and perhaps brokenhearted
man when Grant finally sailed for
England in November, 1811.
But despite his avowals, Grant’s
search for his lost love must have been
far from thorough, for in October, one
month before Grant left Sydney,
Winifred Duriault was married at St.
Phillip’s, Sydney, to Edward Redmond,
who also paid with life-exile for his
part in the Irish troubles of 1798.
From now on the couple’s life was
one of placid domesticity. Redmond
was a steady man with an eye for
business, and in this he was ably
assisted by a devoted wife. He was
the pioneer settler in the Botany
district, but perhaps tiring of the
prospect of life on a grant named
“Mudflat Farm,” in 1820 moved into
town to be host at the Crown and Harp
Inn, in George Street, which he con-
ducted with great probity for many
years. Widowed again in 1840, she
survived her husband for over twenty
years, dying much respected at her
residence on Brickfield Hill on May 7,
1861, aged 85 years.
John Earnshaw.
[Mr. Earnshaw’s statements are
accurate, as were mine. There is no trace
of the Bridget Doulan mentioned in Hill-
Reid’s printed edition. But the micro-
film of the actual Grant journal now
available establishes that the editor of the
journal, for some unexplainable reason,
changed “Winifred Dowling” then
Duriault —into “Bridget Doulan.” Miss
Dowling I would have recognised at
once. Certainly part of Grant’s alleged
love story with her is pure romancing on
bis part. —M.H.E.]
They Arrived by Moonlight: Capt.
Jacques Doneux (Odhams). The
author, an Englishman of Belgian
descent, jumped into Belgium from a
Halifax bomber in 1943 to operate a
secret radio. Eventually he walked
over the Pyrenees into Spain to escape
the Gestapo. An easy, simple, likeable
book, full of excitement.

Bad roads

:©sfin§| you plenty!
A bad road caused this accident. A tight, blind bend
~. the edge of the road crumbling and treacherous .. .
the screech of tyres ... the smash.
You can’t add up in money the value of human
suffering and misery caused through bad roads. But
you can add up the economic cost.to the community.
It is a staggering figure running into millions of
pounds each year. And do you know who'pays this hi HI
It's you who pays—whether you are a car owner or not.
Bad roads take money from your pocket in many
ways, both directly and indirectly-—property damage,
higher vehicle insurance costs, increasing wear and
tear on your vehicle. But, most important of all, bad
roads push up road transport costs which, in turn,
force up your cost of living. In Australia 76 per cent
of all freight is carried by road transport. When out-
moded roads cause road transport break-downs,
freight is delayed. Up go costs of consumer goods.
It is estimated that the cost of freight is 6/- in every
pound you spend on consumer goods. Good roads
would substantially reduce this freight cost—even
by half.
We need a blueprint for better roads—NOW!
Australia has the engineers, the manpower and the
ingenuity 4o build good roads. What is urgently
required is an Australian National Roads Authority,
a single body backed by the necessary powers and
funds. This could be the first step to ensure that our
road construction programme keeps pace with other
phases of national development. Such an Authority
could co-ordinate the plans of existing state and shire
road-making bodies who are doing their best under
great financial difficulties.
Good roads don't cost—thev pav !
