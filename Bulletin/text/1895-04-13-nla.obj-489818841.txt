rpHE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
X (Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ’’
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had Only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing With the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade ma k throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

A W. Q. station is managed by three
brothers, whose name we’ll say is Blair, and whose
line of is a fair day’s work for a fair day’s
pay. ’therefore, among the dead-beat crowd
who whale along the Blinders, these three
are not popular, and the respective sobriquets
p,f “Docky,” “Four Eyes,” and “The Dog”
have been bestowed upon them. “ Docky ”is
the eldest, and one evening lately, as he sat in
the store, musing if the station would pay working
expenses for the year, the voice of the usual sun-
downer came through the doorway. “Is the cove
about?’ inquired the tramp, “Yes,” answered
the owner. “Is it Docky, Four Eyes, or the
Dog that you want?” “Oh, divil a choice,”
answered the tramp; “enny o’ the bastards ’ll
do me to guv me the bit of flour.” “ And,” said
the sundowner, as he related his experience to
his pals "among the billabongs after the discovery
of his mistake, “ he put the bit of dust in me bags
wid a smoile.”— N.Q Register.

A 810 BIZ!
Our Trade is Big! Our Store is Big I
Our Ideas are Big!
We get bigger every day; on Saturday nigbt
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow ?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and dep’orably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s, the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Pew Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our

Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
Why are bulls more savage in England
than in Australia ?
The acme of abomination in art-desecra-
tion has been obtained by an artist who
has copied from Van Beers’ exquisite “My
Friend Mr. White”; substituting, for one of the
figures in the original, that of an advertising
cheap tailor; “My friend, Mr. White, you see,
has been fitted out by me.’’ No acknowledg-
ment of any kind is made as to the original, the
picture simply bearing, very prominently, the
signature of the copyist.

To Mr. H. G. Esquire.
The approach of winter has evidently pro-
duced much activity in the creative minds of
fashionable artistes. Young ladies’ evening cos-
tumes are going to be very pleasant to the eye, at
least if one may take those seen at Messrs. Hichs,
Atkinson and Sons’establishment in Collins-street,
as a criterion. This firm, however, it seems, has
opened new dressmaking rooms specially to cater
for the younger generation, and the combination
of interestingly low prices, elegant taste and high-
class finish will be appreciated by the youth of
social Melbourne.*
When pulling down the old North Mel-
bourne lock-up the other day, the workmen came
across a forgotten skeleton in a box in an out-
house. No one qan remember how the skeleton
came there ; no record concerning it can be found,
and even old officials whose memories of the un-
savoury establishment extend back a distance of
30 years can throw no light on the matter. The
departed bones have some tufts of long black hair
on the skull, but they are so far gone that no one
can even say for certain whether they are of male
or female origin. A pruning-knife was found
along with the bony relic, but whether the deceased
came to his or her end through it no one knows.
Altogether, the North Melbourne skeleton is a
pleasant reminder of how a man may dir appear
in a police-station and never be heard of again.

The “Australian Handbook” for ’95 is
to hand, and, as usual, contains a very large
amount of learning, carefully compiled and
put together. To a person who wants to fill him-
self with every kind of valuable information about
Australasia, or to have that information always
available, this “Handbook” is invaluable. It
contains facts concerning every town in Aus-
tralasia its population, resources, situation,
bow to get there, how to get away again
when you are tired of being theie, its
churches, schools, publicfhonses, newspapers,
rivers, bridges, public buildings, gaols, and
many other matters. It also contains a sketch
of the history of each province, with its
geographical features, climate, divisions, animals,
vegetables, minerals, geology, population, its
religion or want of religion, educational system,
poor-houses, gaols, army, navy, postal and tele-
graphic arrangements, railways, revenue, public
debt, trade, libraries, manufactures, fisheries,
banks, booms, building societies, constitution,
Parliament, Cabinet, tariff, public departments,
&c., &c. There is besides a large amount of British
knowledge for the benefit of the globe-trotting
Australian, and a quantity of banking information
and facts relating to Government loans. The
only omission The Bulletin has struck up to
date is the Westralian Department of Mines and
Education, which seems to have been wholly left
out. And the most notable improvement which

SATURDAY, APRIL 13, 1895.
A New South Wales Distillery.
The proposal to start a distillery in New
South Wales is interesting to the public for
many reasons—one of them being that it.
opens a hitherto unattainable prospect of
pure and wholesome liquor in a country
where most of the liquor supplied has been
infamous. Up to date no serious attempt at
distillation on a large scale—except unlawful
distillation—has been made in the province,
and the new enterprise starts under every
possible drawback. It will have to produce
a fi st-class spirit in order to overcome the
insane Australian prejudice against Austra-
-1 an products, and the grovelling Australian
reverence for imported goods of all descrip-
tions. If the local spirit is only as good as
the foreign article at the same price it
"on’t sell. If it is a little better than
th 3 foreign article at the same price it may
sell, but The Bulletin, after a lengthy
sVidy of the Australian character, has serious
doubts on the subject. If it is a great
deal better than the imported brand, of simi-
lar price, it will sell among that small class
which really knows genuine brandy and
whisky from wood-spirit, carriage-varnish,
and miscellaneous hell-fire, and after a while
it may spread among those other classes
which are not gifted with this intelligence.
But the mere fact that it is a local product
puts it under a great disadvantage at the out-
set, especially in New South Wales. Along
course of Foreign-trade has made the corn-
stalk an individual with a strange and
awful reverence for imports, and a profound
contempt for everything, save race-horses,
pugilists, scullers and cricketers, of local
origin.
• # •
The New South Wales Distillery Co. will
be required, as the law now stands, to pay a
duty of 14s. per gallon, being the same rate
as is levied on spirits of foreign manu-
facture. It is proposed to appeal to Parlia-
ment for a reduction in this rate, but such a
reduction would be so contrary to Free-
trade precedent that its prospects in this
direction are strictly limited. In the event
of the present excise being maintained,
the company will have to compete, in the
first place, against the multitudinous illicit
distiller who pays no duty, whose spirits
are passed on the public as that European
article for which the'cornstalk craves with
an unwholesome craving, and who appeals
to a constituency whose corroded palates are
generally incapable of appreciating the utter
vileness of his product. It will also have to
compete on even terms with the foreign
manufacturer of good liquor made in coun-
tries where wages are still much lower than
in Australia ; and with the foreign manu-
facturer of bad liquor, who has to be
reckoned with seriously because he also has
the advantage of low wages, because he is
foreign, and because his infamous brand of
alcohol can be landed at from Is. to 2s. per
gallon, and sold to a community which is
less particular about its drinks than almost
any ether on this earth. Also, it will have
to compete with the local vigneron, who is
allowed to distil brandy for the purpose of
“fortifying ” his wines, and who sells enor-
mous quantities of the said brandy to the
retail publican, being troubled by practi-
cally no excise supervision, paying no
excise, and running no risks worth men-
tioning, As the law makes no apparent
progress at suppressing the illicit distiller,
makes no serious effort to supervise the
dishonest vigneron, doesn’t even profess to
look after the importer of bad spirits, and
gives every encouragement to the importer
of good spirits to wipe out the local manu-
facturer of the same, the new distillery com-
pany starts under many disadvantages.
« • *
A reduction of the excise from 14s. per
gallon to 7s. or Bs. would, undoubtedly,
place the new industry on a firm footing,
and there is every reason why the present
Foreign-trade Government should, for once,
forget the cast-iron axioms of its creed, and
lend it this measure of encouragement.
Even the great law that no local industry
must be encouraged under any circumstances,
might well give way to the special conditions
of the case. The liquor-duty is, admittedly,
a revenue duty. Its first, last, and only
object is to raise as much revenue as pos-
sible. The high tariff of 14s. per gallon has
not led to the smuggling of foreign spirits
into the province—or, if it has, it has been in
such an infinitesimally small degree that the
circumstance has altogether escaped notice—
for Australia, by reason of its isolation, is
about the worst-situated country in the world
for such a trade. Therefore, there is no per-
ceptible loss of revenue in this direction ; a
vast amount of loathsome alcohol is con-
stantly introduced into the province to ruin
the constitutions of its inhabitants, but it
pays the prescribed duty and the Treasury
has little to complain of. But there is ad-
mittedly an immense loss through illicit dis-
tillation within the province, and, despite all
laws to the contrary, it seems to increase
rather than diminish. The proposed reduc-
tion in the excise would—when a legitimate
local supply is available—reduce the profits
of this illicit trade by one-half, and as the
other half would probably not pay for the
special risks attached, there is every proba-
bility that the business would become almost
extinct. Without the legitimate local supply
the trade would, of course, go on as before,
for then the illicit distiller would compete as
heretofore with the importer at 14s. per
gallon duty, which would be possible;
whereas, under the proposed new conditions,
he would have to compete against the dis-
tiller at, say, 7s. per gallon duty, which
would probably be found impossible. There
is no possible reason, from a revenue stand-
point, for reducing the Customs duty on
spirits, as there is no visible leakage in that
direction ; but the reduced excise would pro-
bably yield as large a revenue as that now
levied, if not a larger one, and it would save
much wear and tear of the police-force and
the gaol authorities, and do something to-
wards making one crime the less in the
calendar.
* # #
The quality of the imported spirit can-
not be effectually supervised, even if a law
existed to provide for such supervision,
without a separate inspection of the con-
tents of each cask and bottle, which is
manifestly impossible. As for the illicit
spirit, it cannot be supervised effectually or
otherwise. But the product of the local dis-
tillery could be constantly inspected and
analysed in bulk by a State officer, and
bottled or otherwise made up under State
supervision, and matured in a bond where it
would be in State custody, and thus its
quality could be absolutely guaranteed under
all circumstances. A similar system, in
Canada, produces what is, probably, the best
and most wholesome whisky in the world,
and there is no earthly reason why it should
not be adopted with equal success in Aus-
tralia. I hus the State could, without loss of
revenue, and possibly with an actual increase
of revenue, establish a valuable local in-
dustry which would give much employment
and yield handsome profits, and vastly im-
prove the quality of the liquor put on the
local market. One woeful sample of bad
liquor—the illicit variety—would vanish
almost wholly as a matter of necessity ; and,
despite the Australian’s prejudice against
local products, the quality of the spirits
produced by the New South Wales distillery
would, sooner or later, compel the importer
to cease introducing some of the worst
varieties of foreign poision. The retail
adulterator would remain about as much in
evidence as ever, and would continue to
make his own liquor on the premises as
heretofore, and would use the local and im-
ported spirit as the basis of infamous con-
coctions in the same old way, but nothing
save the utter abolition of the private
retailer, and the establishment of a State
Drink Department, is ever likely to abolish
this evil. Bub even while the community is
waiting for the arrival of that urgent reform
it would profit to some extent. The honest
retailer, who sells homicidal drinks only
because the wholesale man supplies them to
him as pure and unadulterated, would obtain
a better quality, and the public would get the
benefit of the improvement. And the dis-
honest retailer, who buys adulterated liquors
and then adulterates them over again
before they reach the public, would also
supply a better quality, because his goods
would only be “doctored” once instead of
twice, as heretofore. The improvement, in
his case, might not be great, but, at all
events, some improvement would be unavoid-
able.
* * *
After all, it is an open question whether
the importer and wholesale dealer are not
the parties principally responsible for the
evil quality of the cornstalk’s liquor, and
if they could be induced to go even moder-
ately straight it would probably do more
good than is generally supposed. The law
exercises a certain amount of supervision
over the retailer, and now and then fines
him heavily for selling poisonous drinks ;
but it exercises practically no supervision at
all over the wholesale man, who, theoreti-
cally anyhow, may perpetrate any infamy on
the public with almost absolute impunity,
his only real check, apart from any honesty
he may possess, being the fear of babbling
employes. When the fraud lies between the
man who is able to perpetrate it with com-
parative impunity, and the man who perpe-
trates it at serious risk, the chances
always are that the former is the worse
sinner of the two. In almost every
adulteration case in New South Wales the
defence set up is that the liquor is sold in
exactly the same condition as that in which
it was received from the brewer-or importer.
Nobody takes any notice of this defence, or
proceeds to search the brewer’s or importer’s
premises for similar samples ; the law simply
considers the fact that the publican has been
selling a deleterious compound, and fines
him accordingly. Also the daily press rises
indignantly to point out that a fine is utterly
inadequate punishment for such an enormity,
and obliquely suggests that flogging would
be better adapted to the case. Yet this
defence cannot always be a lie. An immense
proportion of publicans are mortgaged to the
brewer or spirit-dealer, and must take what-
ever kind of liquor he sends them, and if
the brewer never takes advantage of this fact
then he is more than human. Also, as
already mentioned, the wholesale dealer is
almost wholly exempt from supervision, and
if he doesn't take advantage of that fact,
considering the enormous profits to be made,
then he is only a shade lower than the angels
and Paradise is mostly occupied with dead
brewers. Further, the miserable publican,
in very many cases, is too ignorant, or too
much corroded with his own liquors, to
detect the imposition practised upon him,
but as he seldom dare complain whether he
detects it or not, and the magistrate never,
by any chance, believes his complaint, his
ignorance makes no difference in the result.
The retail publican is undoubtedly respon-
sible for much of the nefarious drink in cir-
culation, but to suppose that he is responsible
for it all, and that the wholesale man, who
has so much more to gain, is responsible for
absolutely none, is sheer fatuity.
# 9.9
In urging that the New South Wales
Government should encourage and supervise
the new distillery, The Bulletin does not
suppose for a moment that the establishment
of a local industry will do more than palliate
the existing evils. But it will afford much
profitable employment and help along the
State revenue, and it will at least make
things a little better than they are. When
the State Drink Monopoly—which is the
only visible remedy for the whole disease—
is established, the State Department can
take over the distilling industry as part of
the machinery of the business. Mean-
while, the State Monopoly is still some
distance off, and the other thing is close
at hand, therefore this paper strongly
urges a large reduction in the excise duties
in order to give it a fair start. Consider-
ing chat the local distillery must pro-
duce a far more honest article than the great
bulk of that now imported, and at the
same price, in order to get a hold on the
market ; and that it will have to pay higher
wages than its European competitors ; and
that the Reid Government has lately been
giving some slight assistance to a measure
under which it will get only eight hours
work per diem in return for these high
wages, whereas European distillers get as
much as twelve hours work for less rates
considering all these things, the present
duties constitute a heavy protective tariff in
favor of the foreigner and against the local
producer. And if the Reid Government
does not propose to be a Protectionist
Ministry of the worst order, it should
seriously consider the claims of the new in-
dustry, and see if its principles can’t some-
how be adapted to the necessities of the case.
Dean, the Alleged Poisoner: A Saturday

wife-poisoner, found guilty late on Saturday
night by a tired jury, stimulated by the vigorous
advice of a historically robust Judge, adds
another to the many shocking examples of
hurried alleged justice in New South Wales,
Dean’s case is remarkable, mainly because of
the utter want of direct proof of any kind, and
the absence of even the usual amount of cir-
cumstantial evidence. The prisoner was a young
man recently married to a not uncomely
young wife. The husband, according to the
evidence presented to the court, bore the best
possible character. So, also, as far as appears
from the want of proof to the contrary, did
the wife. And there was no earthly sign of
the presence of the übiquitous “ other woman”
in the background. The pair, so far as appears
on the surface, led a tolerably happy existence,
except for one violently-disturbing element in
the shape of an occasional mother-in-law—a
woman with a history. There was no possi-
bility, so far as the evidence goes, of any
financial profit accruing to Dean by his wife’s
death. There was also no evidence to show that
he was jealous, or that he had reason for jealousy,
or to show that he wanted to be revenged on
his alleged victim for any cause, either real or
fancifuJL In fact, there was no motive, or
shadow of a motive, for Dean’s alleged crime,
so far as the case for the Crown could demon-
strate ; and, as the case for the Crown always
represents every unfavorable circumstance that
can be found or imagined, and every favorable
circumstance that can be suppressed or ex-
plained away, this was more than remarkable.
* * *
Mrs. Dean was poisoned in a clumsy, undis-
guised, and scientifically-ridiculous fashion.
The only persons who had access to her food or
her drink appear—so far as the rather slovenly
evidence goes —to have been her husband, her
mother, and—herself. The flippant Mrs. Dean,
according to her own evidence, first seriously
suspected that she was being poisoned by her
husband when he gave her a certain drink, and
therefore she secreted the suspected fluid in a
safe place, and gave it to her mother some
days afterwards. The reason why she failed
to draw attention to it for some days
was that she had forgotten all about it.
The astounding circumstance that a perfectly
sane woman, who had never been poisoned
before, should wholly forget, for some days
(despite two intermediate visits by the doctor),
that she had in her possession a drink with
which her husband had attempted to compass
her death, is somewhat of a strain upon human
credulity. Nothing like such forgetfulness is
to be found, so far as The Bulletin knows,
anywhere else in the annals of criminology.
There was absolutely no evidence, apart from
the loose and unsupported statements of the
above-mentioned forgetful lady and her mother,
to connect Dean with the crime. Nobody saw
him administer what was known to be poison.
Nobody found any poison in his possession.
The most rigid search failed to prove that he
had obtained poison anywhere, or from anyone.
He allowed his wife’s mother ready access to
her, so that the patient could tell her suspicions,
if she had any. He brought a doctor to attend
her, so that he might And the evidences of
poison staring him in the face. The prosecution
advanced the theory that he did these things “ to
divert suspicion.” If he had refused his mother-
in law admission, and hadn’t obtained medical
assistance, the prosecution would certainly have
pointed to these facts as damning evidence of
Ids guilt. Therefore, whether he got, or did
not get, medical assistance, his guilt was equally
shown either way. What possible line of con-
duct would have been presumptive evidence of
his innocence doesn’t appear.
# # «
The facts naturally pointed to one of four
assumptions. Either Dean poisoned his wife
because he wanted to get rid of her ; or Mrs.
Dean took small quantities of poison herself
and put large quantities in the remains of
her food and drink, in order to fix sus-
picion on her husband, because she wanted
to get rid of him; or Mrs. Dean’s mother
manipulated the poison for some reason known
only to herself ; or the crime was done by a
fourth party, as yet unsuspected, for some pur-
pose also unsuspected. Dean having been
arrested, it became the business of the Crown
to prove that he obtained poison somewhere
for his alleged murderous purpose, and in this
the Crown failed. It being the Crown’s busi-
ness, from the moment of his arrest, or, at any
rate, from the moment of his committal, to con-
vict Dean and no one else, with or without,
certain evidence, it was (arguing from his-
tory) no concern of the Crown’s to find whether
any other passible criminal had procured poison,,
or had it in his or her possession. Dean, him-
self, being closely confined, could not prosecute,
this search ; he had no police or detective force,
at command to do it for him, and no Treasury
to pay the expenses of the investigation. In
the absence of a Public Defender, with a staff
of detectives to work up the prisoner’s case
and to gain kudos by securing his acquittal as
the other side would by securing his conviction,
with first-class legal assistance, and the Trea-
sury to defray the necessary charges, the case
resolved itself—as all such cases do—into a
struggle between the whole combined intelli-
gence of the police, the trained ability of the
Crown Law Department and all the financial
resources of the State, on one hand, and on the
other—one man, shut up in a prison, with what-
ever money he might have saved out of a scanty
wage, or be able to procure from his friends, as
his means of hiring defenders. Then the jury
was called upon to decide between the man
who, as far as the closest investigation could
reveal, had no poison in his possession, and the
other possible parties concerning whom no such
exculpatory evidence was presented, and the
Crown, by all the eloquence and influence at
command, called on it to decide that the former
was guilty.

Judge Windeyer “ summed up—stereotyped
phrase !—strongly against the prisoner.” But
in this case Mr. Windeyer did more than sum
up against the prisoner. The jurymen retired
at 12.25 p.m., but apparently the evidence was


regarded by them, or a number of them, as so
uncertain that they hesitated, despite the
unveiled or very thinly hidden opinion of the
Bench that it was their duty to convict.
Whereupon Mr. Windeyer, at 8 o’clock,
recalled the twelve men who were expected
to come to an unbiassed and deliberate
decision in a matter involving life and death,
and expressed to them his astonishment that
they should find any difficulty in deciding so
simple a case. His own summing-up of the
■evidenceshowedthat, inhisopinion, DEANshould
the convicted (which, if the law-allotted punish-
uneut followed in the usual course, meant hang-
iing), and his words expressed his astonishment
tthat they didn’t convict Dean right away. Mr.
Windeyer’s attitude was that of a learned man
accustomed to weighing evidence, expressing
■surprise and scorn that other men, unaccus-
tomed to weighing evidence, should be so
ignorant, so stupid, and so utterly illogical
as not to seal Dean’s fate upon the spot. He
also reminded them that they would be locked
op till Monday morning if a verdict was not
reached by midnight. His Honor again
proceeded, at his own request, to sum
up a few of the leading points against'the
prisoner, briefly alluded to the theory of the
defence as “ monstrous,” and chided the
jury for its reluctance to dispose of the case
without hesitation. Also, he declared, almost
#n so many words, that it was the duty of the
Jurymen to convict Dean, and hinted to them
jthat they could recommend him to mercy. The
; scorn of the Judge doubtless weighed with
ithe jurymen, accustomed to regard a Judge
with reverence; and so, probably, did the
prospect of 34 hours’ further uncomfortable con-
finement. Whereupon the jury (which had
been out for eight full hours without agreeing)
collapsed and returned a verdict of guilty
within seven minutes, and complied with the
demand of its joint and several conscience by a
recommendation to mercy, as suggested.
* # •
The verdict was arrived at about 8.50 p.m.
by a body of hard-driven men, whose in-
telligence was obscured by physical exhaustion
and other influences. It was reached only under
extreme pressure of argument, ridicule and
judicial persuas oi. The recomme I 'ation to
mercy was an outrage on logic ; if there was any
reasonable doubt of Dean’s guilt he deserved
an acquittal; if there was no doubt then (no
matter that he is 27 years old, has lived a good
>life in the sight of all men, and has saved several
Ilives by bravely risking his own)he was amonster
vwho, having cold-bloodedly poisoned thesick wife
•whom he pretended to nurse, deserved no mercy.
A 1 io, it lies within the Judge’s province to advise
(either that the recommendation be confirmed or
ithat it should be ignored, and in most cases it is
ignored. Every intelligent man in tiie com-
munity should be fully aware of that fact, so if
any sing’e juryman, who would, upon his con-
science, have acquitted Dean if that recom-
mendation had not been attached, ventured to
convict him because it was attached, then there
falls upon him the weight of an immeasurably
awful responsibility. The roundabout sug-
gestion from the bench conveying that the jury-
men who hesitated to convict might do so with
a recommendation to mercy, ought, in all
justice, to have been accompanied by a clear
and emphatic statement that to the Judge was
reserved the right to advise the Executive to
confirm or ignore that feeble compromise, and
that the rider to the jury’s verdict might be—
as proved by many such compromises in the
past —so much folly and empty air,
* * f *
Mo Judge has a moral right to sum
up strongly either for or against the
firisoner; his business is to give an abso-
ulely dispassionate summary of the evidence,
and nothing more. No Judge has a moral right
to denounce the defence as “monstrous;” it
is for the jury alone, and purely on their own
motion, to decide whether it is monstrous or
not. No Judge has a moral right to tell the
jury in effect that it is its duty to convict, or
to interfere with its deliberations, or to suggest
nr to seem to suggest, however vaguely, any
mea-us by which any member of it ipay
an average with his doubts or scruples or con-
victions, op to influence it by reminding it that
34 hours’ detention will necessarily follow on any
further hesitation, Such things can only act as
an invitation to ordinary mortal jurymen to
sacrifice their opinions, and either convict the
prisoner when they are not absolutely sure he
should be convicted, or acquit him when they are
jiiot sure that he should be acquitted, in order to
save themselves a temporary inconvenience.
Also, no Judge has a moral right to express, by
word or deed, his lofty and dignified astonish-
ment at the jury for deliberating long and
earnestly where a human life is at stake, or to
(Openly exhibit his own opinions, and thereby
influence the opinions of the jury, who are, and
should be, the sole judges of evidence and argu-
ment, Further, no man should be convicted or
acquitted at night, after a previous long-night
sittings—the Dean jury had sat from morning
till nearly midnight on Friday —by a
weary, jaded jury, whose intelligence, or
the intelligence of any member of it, is ob-
scured by physical exhaustion ; and even the
stern Mosaic law of a life for a life does not
permit of the taking of a life where no life has
been taken. The Mount Rennie verdict, by
.the way, was also a Saturday night verdict.
The Feast of Sains Barmaid.
Dear Bulletin, —Every woman is a barmaid
at heart. If anybody doubts this statement let
him walk through the streets on a Hospital
Saturday, or attend a charitable flower-show
or bazaar. But, as there are bars and bars, so
there are barmaids and barmaids. And though
there is a natural desire in every woman to
illustrate her barmaidenly proclivities, yet none
can pass beyond the limitations of her own par-
ticular type. Thus the modest and retiring
young lady, new to the business, cannot hope
to emulate the methods of the resolute female
who has learnt by years of experience in the
private trade to believe that men may be
divided into two classes —those who may be
intimidated, and those who must be cajoled.
But practice may do much ; she may, after a
day or two, or an hour or two, get rid of her
modesty and emerge from her retirement, dis-
card black and take to color, and with an
embellished shape, complexion, and hair, delight
to run her course.
• # #
Do not let me be supposed to speak dis-
respectfully of the many good and modest girls
" horn stress of circumstances often drives to
make an honest living behind a counter. I use
the word barmaid in the old-fashioned sense,
when it was popularly understood to indicate
thesomewhat flashy—and, as a rule, impudent—
young lady whose type still survives in private
bars, and is to be seen in the streets of Sydney
upon the festival which I have ventured to
call that of St. Barmaid, commonly known as
Hospital Saturday.
* * »
With what ardor the dear creatures take to
the business ! With how much pains and care
must the parts have been rehearsed—in some
few cases to fail through stage-fright at the
last moment. But not in many. Here, for
instance, is dear old Mrs. Medlar, who cuts
me persistently several times a week. For how
many weeks must she have practised that grin
with which she sails up to me, accompanied
by three little unripe Medlars, all wearing
the same expression. I have seen that grin
before; I saw it at a flower-show, years ago,
upon the last occasion when Mrs. Medlar
spoke to me and forced me to buy a bunch
of moribund weeds. She keeps that grin for
the feast of St. Barmaid and other charitable
festivals. And now she has taught it to the
three Miss Medlars. But evidently they have
further instructions. The old woman-of-war
sails up and clears for action. I am a small
man, and very timid, and I try to outsail her;
but I am not to be allowed to escape in this
fashion ; her fast cruisers swoop down upon me
and I must pay my ransom. lam as one who
has strayed into a private bar, desiring beer,
and to whom it is pointed out that it would be
mean and shabby to leave without paying a
tribute to beauty in champagne.
*- * *
As I pass along the street I meet several
timid and shamefaced young ladies who hold
out a deprecatory box. I feel almost ashamed
to do nothing for these, and fear that they are
plying a somewhat unremunerative business.
But I know that time brings its revenges, and I
am quite sure that some of them will get the
better of me hereafter. Good example will
soon teach them to address a strange man in the
most shameless manner and to grin and ogle
with the best of the Miss Medlars. At the
next corner I hear a silvery voice say : “ There
is a man—l must go after him.” And she
comes. In vain I represent that I have paid
my footing at the railway-station, in an omni-
bus, and to Mrs. Medlar. “Ah ! but you will
not refuse me !” she says and begins to fire a
sort of Hotchkiss gun of smiles and soft words
at me ; and I am scowled upon by two young
gentlemen who stand by—the same young
gentlemen who glowered darkly upon me the
other day when I ventured to ask Miss Polly,
of the Blank Hotel, for half a pint of beer.

There is a fable of a man who had two chil-
dren, a boy and a girl. Determined to turn
them to profitable account he sent them out to
beg. The boy he provided with a monkey; the
girl trusted to her xiatural attractions. In the
evening the boy returned with empty pockets,
but the girl with a handful of silver. The
Eublic took no interest ip the boy or the mon-
ey. It is always thus with charity. And,
fyfter all, may not money be obtained at too
dear a price ? Why are there po ipale collec-
tors on these occasions ? (Dan it be that they
have nothing to sell in the way of smiles
am) good looks? For, after all, does it
not crime to this ? These ladies are doing one
qf two things. Either they are holding a moral
pistol at my head, thinking that my courage
will not avail me to resist their demand to
stand and deliver : or they think that their
qwn charms will seduce me into giving what I
would not give on any other terms. The first
case is a moral robbery by moral violence ; the
second is a sale of good looks at so much
down. Of course, this is done for a good
object; but then, the avoidance of starvation is
a good object too ; and I infer no more than that
every woman is at heart a barmaid, and is pre-
pared to qualify for the business, and conduct
it con amove , in the least possible time.
« • *
I admit that these remarks are to a certain
extent colored by spite and envy. I confess
that I felt sore when I caught Miss Cynthia
Smiles casting sheep’s-eyes upon a pork-
butcher, who twirled a meditative sovereign in
his horny palm : and I could not but feel that I
should like to go round with Mr. Silenus Dives
and buy a reputation for generosity at quite a
moderate price in quarters where it might prove
socially useful. I should like to be able to
stand and chat familiarly with persons belong-
ing to quite exclusive circles ; and, since I am
too old to attract them, I should like to pur-
chase a few glowing smiles before the New
Woman comes along, and there shall be no bar-
maids any more in the land, and the maid shall
be even as the monkey.— An Alleged Man.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bra sey.
Says a patronising London weekly :
It ii probable that even had the Victorians not repented
at the eleve.ith hour of their cheeseparing ways in re-
ducing the Gcneraoi’s salary to £5OOO, they would still
have been governed by Lord Brassey. But although “a
thousand or two one way or the other can make very little
difference to Lord Brassey,” a bargain is a bargain, and
when the vote was communicated to Lord Brassey he
said so—and more. Aj it is, the £7OOO which he agreed
to accept is £3OOO less than his predecessors have had.
The Victorians have yet to learn that if they want orna-
mental peCis of eminence they must pay for them.
But inasmuch as Victorians in general do not
want these things, they have yet to learn that
the cockney journalist who perpetrated the
a'live paragraph is other than an offensive
ass. For the information of all such foreign
creatures we may add that “Victorians”
have never repented anything in connection
with Brassey’s salary save their own lack of
public spirit in permitting the Legislative
Assembly to be bounced, without entering a
formal protest. There was no bargain to pay
Hopetoun’s successor £7OOO a year, for after a
Bill to that effect had passed the Assembly,
during the reign of King Patterson, it stuck in
the Council, and didn’t get communicated to the
’Ome Government officially. And even though
Patterson, after his fall (or somebody else), may
have communicated with his old friend, Agent-
General Gillies, saying in effect: “ Tell them
to engage a new man at £7OOO as soon as pos-
sible, otherwise the Radical mob will cut the
salary down to £5000;” even though Patter-
son, or somebody, may have worked the
business thus, there was no “bargain” made
between Brassey and “ the Victorians.” The
appointment of that bulging capitalist seven
months before he could be landed as Governor
in Melbourne, is a little matter which speaks
for itself. No sooner did the wily au-
thorities discover that a £5OOO reduction
was in the air than they dumped Baron
Brassey upon the Victorian taxpayer, and
ticketed the noble bit of goods, “£7OOO
Extremely Reasonable.” The Leg. Assembly,
after deciding not to pay more than £5OOO for
any sort of Governor, ornamental or otherwise,
was informed that the purchase of Brassey had
been duly made on Victoria’s behalf—in order
to dish the Radicals. So much for the alleged
“ bargain,” concerning which almighty Brassey
is said to have expressed himself in strong
terms. One more remark. It is not “ pro-
bable that the Victorians would still have been
governed by Lord Brassey ” at a lower salary.
His condescension and wealth are undoubted.
He would not refuse to govern them entirely
“on his own”—nay, he would embrace the
idea—if the opportunity offered. But, un-
happily for Brassey, the Victorians have not
the slightest intention of letting themselves be
governed by a casual British peer. A few of
them may cheer Brassey when he arrives, and
grovel to him whilst he remains on hand, bub,
as for the people of Victoria, all the governing
they are to get from Brassey will be expressed
by the smoke from the cannons that announce
his swearing-in.
The Curse of the Absentee. y
A London paper, the Capitalist, has a
grievance against The Bulletin. It asks :
Where will the Sydney Bulletin find evidence of the
“curse” of the absentee? The South Australian Com-
pany is marked out as a special offender, being “ famous
as the hardest rack-renters in the province.” This is
strong language, but turned from the colonial idiom into
mother country tongue, it means that when times are
hard for the tenants the landlord must volunteer to abro-
gate the legal contracts with his tenants and go bare him-
self rather than they should be inconvenienced. The
colonial Government, which is mainly the representative
of the tenants, has already appropriated a great slice of
the landlords’ profits in the form of taxation on unim-
proved value, and adds a few more feathers of the same sort
for the crime of absenteeism. The skinning process of
the Government is to be followed by a boneing operation
on the part of the settlers, and the landlord must inevit-
ably become mere offal. Thus the sins of extravagance,
and indiscretion on the part of the children are to be paid
for out of the substance of the fathers of the community.
The capital of the South Australian Company and its
congeners has been sunk with a feeling of confidence in
the honesty of the colonials, and this in effect is now to
be confiscated. The cake was offered for a consideration,
and accepted on those terms. The moment they are felt
to be inconvenient they must be set aside, and thus,
having eaten first, the colonials insist that they have not
had the best of the bargain, appropriate the confection,
and refuse to recognise the obligation of the consideration.
This is a fine sample of confused metaphor and
hard lying. The South Australian Co. didn’t
sink its capital “ with a feeling of confidence in
the honesty of the colonials,” for it sunk hardly
any capital, and it didn’t deal with the
“ colonials ” at all. About 40 or 50 years ago
that lucky company bought from the Imperial
Government 40,000 acres of first-class land at
12s. per acre. Its founders gave the most
solemn assurances that they did not propose to
make money in any shape or form out of the
deal ; that they were philanthropists pure and
simple, whose sole object was to facilitate set-
tlement. They got the land—partly, at least—
by reason of that sinful misrepresentation. The
“colonials” didn’t get the S.A. Co.’s capital,
but they now pay that co. many thousands a
year in rent, and, if they want to buy it out,
and get rid of the incubus, the transaction will
cost them, on present valuations, £1,700,000.
Which is a tolerably steep price to pay in
return for that £24,000, which the South Aus-
tralians didn’t receive, about two generations
ago, and to square a transaction concerning
which they weren’t even consulted. Where
is the curse of the absentee ? Everywhere !
New South Wales Justice Windeyer’ B
theory of the personal rights of jurors may
be briefly stated thus : Jurors kept over-
night during the hearing of a case are
entitled to sleeping conveniences ; but if
kept over-night to find a verdict after the
close of a case they are not entitled to sleeping
conveniences. There is no moral or physical
difference between a juror listening to argu-
ments and one making up an opinion on their
merits, and the value of the intellectual effort
to the country is precisely the same ; while it
is aboriginally unscientific to fatigue and sicken
the body with a view to promoting intellectual
activity. The loss of a few hours’ time is of
no importance as compared with the gain from
the probable superiority of the verdict of
twelve men refreshed by a sound night’s
sleep over that of twelve men wearied by a long
day’s work. On common grounds, moreover,
the theory is seriously battered by the common
practice of Judges themselves, who fre-
quently reserve their judgments (which are ver-
dicts) until next day and sometimes for
many days, and in the meantime don’t consider
it compulsory to stay out of bed all the time.
On another common ground Judges’ practice
again badly batters the theory Judge Win-
deyer sets up, inasmuch as the theory implies
that juries must, even at the greatest personal
sacrifices, keep on at their case till a verdict or
the legal equivalent is reached, whereas J udges
are known to have over and over again, sus-
pended cases and adjourned cases, even capital
ones, half-way through the hearing, in order
to dine at Government House, or for some such
trivial purpose. Presuming that a jury sat up
and stayed awake in a bedless room and arrived
at a decision at 2.15 a.rn., would the presiding
Judge, whoever he might be, be on hand to
receive its verdict—or would the jurors have to
sit up for the balance of the night in their bed-
less prison ?

New South Wales Assembly’s preliminary ap-
proval of a wooden bridge over Darling Harbor
suggests Sydney Smith’s jibe, that “ if they
laid their heads together the thing would be
done.” For who but wooden-headed individuals
would build a wooden bridge as a permanent
structure in this age of stone and steel ? Fancy
a new wooden bridge over the Thames at
Loudon ! In any case, the property-holders
and municipalities on each side should find the
bulk of the money. Why should the fat metro-
politan pigs be always greased at the expense
of the poor little country porkers? An en-
lightened policy, on the contrary, would always
starve Australian cities for the benefit of the
country districts—such a menace to national
welfare has the disproportionate size of the
former become. At present, Australian Govern-
ments seem doing their best by subsidies for
this, that, and the other metropolitan institu-
tion to attract people from productive employ-
ment in the country—where conditions are natu-
rally unpalatable to comfort-loving humanity—
and accumulate them as unemployed or com-
paratively non-productive workers in Sydney,
and Melbourne, and other large towns ; where
there are good pavements, gas-lamps and shop-
windows, billiard saloons, theatres, and races
every week. The countryman has to lift the
big end of the log already, and every city
deputation which persuades Ministers to grant
money for city pleasures or improvements that
the citizens should- pay for themselves adds
another twig to the load he staggers under.
The Argus gives prominence to the following
letter :
TO THE EDITOR OK THE ARGUS.
Sir, —It must have aff irded protectionists great satis-
faction to-day to read that a request had been made in
the House of Commons for a duty on Victorian buttei
and cheese. If the request be complied with, in what
position will bo the producer of butter and cheese in
Victoria? — Yours, &c., W. J. Allan, April 2.
The case could hardly be stated more clearly.
The local producers always have the home
market—and whether they wall always have
the foreign market is another matter. The
House of Commons has a perfect right to tax
imports from Victoria, just as Victoria has
exercised its perfect right to tax imports from
England. If Australians cater for the Austra-
lian market they can expect equitable condi-
tions—if they cater for foreign markets, as
long as they remain open, they have to be con-
tent to compete with free-born Englishmen
whose bodies are sold to the squire and souls
to the vicar for Bs. a week ; or with Asiatics
who wear only a loin-rag and live on a handful
of rice a day ; or with half-breeds in South
America who think sixpence a day a com
petence.
Among Victoria’s other monetary troubles she
is much harassed by the failure of local authori-
ties to pay up interest and principal of their
debts to the Treasury. The amount advanced
by the State to Local Government bodies is
something like £2,000,000, and the amount
repaid is so ridiculously small as not to be
worth mentioning. Also, the interest in arrear
is more than equal to the repayments. Almost
all of the local bodies could pay up if they
chose to tax themselves to a reasonable extent,
but, as a rule, they find it cheaper and more
convenient to default. Also, the Government
doesn’t exercise its power to appoint a receiver
to collect the rates of the defaulting districts,
principally because the local member howls
piteously on the departmental door-mat and
implores it to abstain from such hard measures.
Also, the same local member now proposes, in
a tentative sort of fashion, that the arrears
should be converted into new loans, and the
burden passed on to posterity. Probably this
idea w ill be adopted sooner or later. Every
burden is passed on to posterity in Australia,
and when posterity comes along and realises
what has been done to it, it w ill curse its fore-
fathers with a curse that will make them shiver
in their graves, or in their urns, or wherever
they may happen to be.
Editor Bulletin, —Re a recent query :
The infelicitous phrase, “pre-eminent in grief,”
prigged by the great man of N.S.W. from the
great man of England, was stolen by the latter
from an earlier source—indeed, such a blind over-
leaping of hyperbole and tumbling int® irony
could scarcely have been both original and sincere.
Applied to the utterly bereaved captive Queen of
Troy, the expression is sublime; applied to Vic-
toria the Lucky, it is ridiculous. Here is the
matrix of that jewel, three words long, which, on
the stretched forefinger of the irreverent, is likely
to sparkle for some time yet :
Where is the wretched Hecuba, my friends,
Who, in her woes, surpasses all, or male,
Or of the female race ? Her none can rob
Of her just claim, pre-eminence in grief.
—Woodhuil s {1809) translation of Euripides Hecuba,

The Melb. jury which found for Mrs. Lange
in the “ family libel case,” and gave that worthy
lady .£750 damages against her son-in-law, Dr.
Bage, seems to have ignored his Honor’s summing-
up altogether. Judge A’Beckett made ic clear to
them that Mrs. Lange talked and wrote a good
deal of stuff which, at the time, suggested an un-
sound state of mind. Also, he dwelt on the fact
that Dr. Bage, as trustee of the estate for the
family at large, had nothing to gain by asserting
his relative’s insanity, and was not to be suspected
of financial motives. Likewise, he gave the jury
a strong hint that the verdict should express their
disapproval of the plaintiff’s unwisdom in bring-
ing an action, any way. But the six men in the box
unanimously declined to take the Judge’s views of
the case. It was such a very family case that
they preferred to follow their own family feelings,
which were feelings of contempt for Dr. Bage's
folly in aggravating Mrs. Lange’s foolishness.
The question of legal rights and wrongs was
hardly worth considering. The lady could show
a little excuse for coming to court, whereas the
doctor could show none. He might have mollified
his mother-in-law before she set the snowball of
costs a-rolling, and he certainly had it in his
power to end the squabble with an apology—a
few soft words, ere the accursed 20 days’ trial was
entered upon. Some thousands of pounds must
come from one side or the other in this stupid
strife. The jury thought that Dr, Bage ought to
suffer. But Dr. Bage isn’t satisfied to suffer, and
is appealing fo. a new trial.

My Deak Mookabixda—
Sydney was thrilled one day last week by the
arrival and departure of the Gaiety girls. There
are also Gaiety boys, although one doesn’t hear so
much of them (owing, I suppose, to the press being
largely a masculine institution). And really, with
one or two exceptions—for one, the ever-beauteous
Charles Ryley, who looks more Byronic than ever;
and, for another, the military Mr. Cecil Hope,
Miss Moore’s adored and adoring husband elect—
with these two exceptions, I say, the Gaiety
youths will not do wholesale damage. The large,
welter-weight comedian, though seemingly in his
artistic prime, is considerably “over seven,” and
the small funny man seems too mercurial to make
a lasting impression on anybody. lam afraid
Charles Ryley will have to resign himself to being
the Adonis of the troupe.
His Well-recognised beauty will not lack femi-
nine foils, for some of the Gaiety girls are distinctly
“ Kyp-” Taking them as a whole, they are a neat
consignment, with fewer indications of a rush of
gold-wash to the back-hair than have been exhi-
bited bypnany other visiting Gaiety Co.’s—though,
really, the Gaiety principals never were very
painty in private, you remember, Nellie Farren
having set the fashion of clean faces. Alias Lecima
Moore, who will gain the enthusiastic affection of
masculine Australia, if 1 am any sort of a
Jeremiah, is a small, plump divinity, with bronze
hair, electric-grey eyes, and a sparkling face.
She was the only Gaiety girl en route who sported
a tight-fitting dress, and certainly her black-croco-
dile crepou, lashed round the waist with jet lines,
fitted her shapely limbs like a second cuticle. A
black toreador hat in jetted lace with ostrich-tips
and a dab of blue under the brim, and a black
fisher’s-net veil, completed the rig. Miss Moore
is a very chatty, confiding little thing, who calls her
fianc4 “ darling ”as patronisiuglv as if her head
wasn’t about on a level with his elbow.” She is a
cousin of “ Katherine ” Lardelli’s, by the way.
Maud Hobson (“Hobson ” from Hobson’s Bay :
she was born on the shores thereof) is Junoesquely
handsome, with regular features, soft brown eyes
and golden hair ; she possesses a majestic figure
which even her baggy “sailor” costume of blue
serge and jumper jacket, with striped dickey and
raan-o’-war collar could not conceal. A diamond
brooch and a bunch of red roses adorned her bust.
Miss H. is particularly rich in diamonds, by the
way. She has left behind her in Loudon a
diamond necklace valued at nine thousand, but
has brought the rest of the spoil with her—just to
show the shattered remnant of Australian patrons
of burlesque that she has quite grown out of
bouquets and bons-bons. Her stage-gowns are
gorgeous, they tell me, and so are Miss M issey’s
(she plays the title-rflle in the “ Gaiety Girl ”).
Miss Massey is the moat romantic-looking mem-
ber of the band, and is addicted to fly-cage veils
and floppy clothing; she is said to look a dream
of exquisite loveliness on the stage. A certain
travelled theatrical manager of my acquaintance
plumps heartily for Aliss Massey. “The loveliest
woman I ever saw in my life,” he says.
Miss Palotta is tall and charming, with brown
eyes and hair, most winning manners, and a neat
style of dressing herself. She travelled to Mel-
bourne in a blue serge skirt and coat, with an
electric-blue silk blouse, neat hat, and thick cream
lace veil. Aliss Rossell is the solo dancer (new
name for premiere (Hnseuse). She is very strong
in pearly teeth and big brown eyes (taken alto-
gether, they are a brown-eyed Hand), and possesses
a trim, round figure. She told me there were no
logs in the piece—none of hers, at any rate, for
she dances in skirts, though not, thank Heaven,
E irl of Yarmouth serpe-ntiniugs. which are after-
date. Aliss Lloyd is a tall, fine seraph, some-
what reminiscenoy of Aloua Rathbone about the
profile—l was not able to judge whether she
resembles that symmetrical charmer in other good
points.
Going over to Alelbourne, as luck would have
it, the “Gaiety ” train ran into a mob of bullocks,
which were camped on the railway-line near
Wagga. Not much damage was done (though the
bullocks, doubtless, regarded the matter more
seriously), but the probability is that the little
affair will convince the Mary-oome-lately Gaiety
girls that Australian cattle pasture on the rail-
way-lines, and that the railway refreshment room
man rushes out and slaughters one of them when
the beef sandwiches give out. First impressions
are so lasting, and if any of the Gaiety people
meditate printing theirs when they get ’Ome,
“Livestock vc-sus Rolling Stock, an every-day
concussion in N.S. W.,” would make a thrilling
item wherewith to astonish J. Bull, of London.
Miss Moore and Miss Palotta spent their day
in Sydney at the Zoo. It is always safest—in a
foreign country—to go at once to the Zoo. It is
sometimes the easiest plan of accustoming your-
self to the peculiarities of the inhabitants.
By the way, the G. g.’s felt the Sydney heat
dreadfully, and one of them confided to me (I do
hope I am not betraying her confidence) that she
had already left some of her clothes off in conse-
quence. If it is hotter in Melbourne (which,
fortunately, isn’t likely) I tremble to think what
will be the last state of the Gaiety girl. But it
just strikes me that we may have cruelly mis-
judged Gaiety girls gone before. Perhaps it was
the Australian climate which made them cut their
wardrobes so fine ?
Madame Henry’s reunion at her rooms, Pitt-sb.,
near Park-st., took the form, the other Wednes-
day, of a farewell afternoon to a graceful
Sydney lady who goes for a trip to Europe on
13th inst. The programme included variegated
music, singing, and the clever rendition of a
farce, “La Lettre Chargee,” smartly played by
Mrs. Lumsdame in a cream crepon tea-gown with
eau-de-nil wing sleeves and cut-steel belt ; Dr.
Roth, who represents the sender of the letter to per-
fection ; Mr. Cooper as the drowsy lover, and
Miss Mowle as the chambermaid—all members, be
it said, of Madame Henry’s cercle-litteraire. The
affair ended with British afternoon tea, though
one felt the environment so Frenohy that liqueurs
and eke cigarettes would have formed a happier
sequence. Mine. Henry’s Cercle (which is areally
cultured club) starts the new season with dis-
tinct success.
TllO composer. Dr. Charles MicCarthy, M.D.,
sends me a copy of the “ Lyceum Valse,” dedi-
cated to his little daughter, Miud MacCarthy,
whose char.ningly-childish portrait adorns the
cover. The valse is preluded by a dreamy intro-
duction, changing sharply to a most effective for-
tissimo staccato passage. The composition is
altogether most taking and rausicianly, and more
especially when played by the composer. From
publisher H. J. Samuels I have thankfully received
a copy of the fetching “Nautch Song,” sung by
the Only Nellie in “Mills. Nitouche,” an 1 com-
posed expressly for her by La m Caron. Nellie S.,
in the n wer-to-be-forgotten Nautch dress, allows
her portrait to grace the title-page of the song,
which is bright and sufficiently fl >rid, and is built
to suit a mezzo-soprano. Talking of music, I am
pleased t > see that Mr. Aug. W. Juncker’s songs,
“ I Was Dreaming ” and “ All in All,” have been
most cordially praised by two leading London
newspapers.
The ball in aid of Lewisham Hospital (a new
operating-room is sadly needed) is to take place on
Bth prox., in Sydney Town Hall, and already pro-
mises to be a success. Tickets are : Single, 7s.
61.; double, 12s. G I.—low prices for the first big
ball of the se ison. The “Centennial ” Tennis Club
holds a bread-and-butter dance in Paddington
Town-ball on 9th prox. in aid of the club’s funds.
Miss Edith Ridley and Miss Agnes Mowle are
the lion, secretaries and treasurers.
Hospital Saturday (second edition) in Sydney
transpired on 6th inst., and I wasn't at all sur-
prised to see that man (whosometimes is a Brute,
as “Tith.” says in that delightful play, “ Rebel-
lious Susan ”) occasionally made the most of his
chance, though I suppose charity covereth
many familiarities which I am sure would be
instantly resented by the lady if she hadn’t the
Guo 1 Cause in tow. A collection-box covereth a
multitude of things. Now, please, don’t bolt with
the idea that I saw Esan kissing K ite, or any-
thing half so crude as that; only two instances
came under my immediate notice, and they needed
a keen eye to detect them, too; but thestingof
such things lies more in their manner than their
magnitude. The aggressor in each case was a
well-dressed youth, not a “larrikin, whose nature
can only be reached by the lash,” according to the
framer of the N.S. W. Vice-suppression Bill. I
saw “larrikins” give their mite, too. One said
“Thank yer,” as he dropped a coin in.
And they had_ chap Tones on Hospital Saturday
(which looks as if gooseberries were getting played
out)—one sheep-dog under an umbrella while her
flock tore about after coppers. It looked ridiculous
—girls scooting round making a biziarof the
public streets under chaperon age, forsooth. What,
for instance, would the old-fashioned brand of
chaperone—the iuauguratrass, as it were, of the
gooseberry-movement—-think of a damsel who
went about rattling a money-box under the noses
of totally strange men? The only people who
weren’t bailed up were the gentlemen of the
Domain, who must have found something melun-
choly in their immunity from the common tax.
The success that Amyk os has met with,
and the uni versa favour it enjoys liotli in the Old
and New VVorlds, is a sufficient guarantee of the
advantages resulting from its use as a mouth-
wash, gargle, cosmetic, &c. It is unanimously
acknowledged to possess a mild and, at the same
time, energetic efficacy as an antiseptic water,
and is superior to all antiseptics at present known
to science, as expressed by Professor Sir Joseph
Lister, of E linbnrgh, in the Lancet— which alone
ought to mike Amykoa a household word for
the Australian, who esteems cleanliness. Price,
Is. 61. per bottle at all chemists, perfumers, &c.
The really clever division—the men with livers,
who hate being smiled at and worried—travelled in
cabs on Hospital Saturday.
Hospital Saturday is certainly a neat way of
netting the little fish, and it has one all-pervading
virtue—the givers are anonymous. Wo are not
disgusted witli long lists in the newspapers next
morning reciting how Mr. Blank gave this and Mr.
Hash that—making an advertising-placard of the
greatest virtue. But Hospital Saturday in some
cities has its abuses. Last year, 1 mind me, a
much-daughtered partner in a large Victorian
business house, who had the hospital-collection
fever very badly—took one of the “girls’ ” boxes
to his place of business and passed it round among
his employes. When the box was returned to
him it contained a mere handful of coppers.
This so incensed “pa” that, despite its being
proved that the men subscribed largely to the
hospitals through outdoor channels, on the follow-
ing pay-day he went round to each with
the man’s wages in one hand and the collection-
box in the other! I am not versed in the in-
tricacies of the Masters and Servants’ Act, or
whatever it is called, but I am quite sure there
ought to be some means for the suppression of that
kind of tyranny.
I am pleased to hear that the widely-circulated
rumor in re the alleged religious intolerance of an
official lady has no substantial foundation. The
lady certainly did decline to open a suburban
R.C. fair—but then she, the other day, even
politely refused to perform the opening ceremony
at a bazaar in connection with a church she her-
self attends. The explanation is that it is really
to prevent jealousy and ill-feeling on the subject
that she has declined to open any suburban
religious catchpenny, no matter what denomina-
tion it is in aid of. She cannot possibly act for
them all, and to patronise one and not another
means the raising of the party cry.
In Brisbane it is now quite the fashion for
young women to marry men old enough to be their
fathers, and even when the Queensland man stalks
abroad to m arry (as happened in a recent notable
high society” instance) Tima has generally
got his scalp-lock for a keepsake. I believe I
detect a masculine tendency (in Queensland) to
treat matrimony, like a game of bowls, as only
fit for well-matured and over-ripe manhood. The
latest happy pair up North will not suffer much at
honeymoon resorts, for he is a comparatively
ancient political warrior, and she a nice girl her-
self, the daughter of a father who relieved himself
of elderly widowerhood by taking a very young
wife.
Very many people will regret to hear that the
wife of ex-Premier Parkis continues extremely ill,
having undergone a serious operation. Her con-
dition is considered very critical indeed.
I was much amused at a remark Miss Decima
Moore ma le to me, and to apparently every mem-
ber of the Sydney press, in re Mr. Violet Varley
Tap ley, who is an old comrade of hers. “I do
like Mr. Tapley,’’ she said, in her exuberant con-
versational way reminisc mt of a person squeezing
their words out of a sponge in soprano—“ he is
such a gentleman. How is it, I wonder, that so
few tenors are gentlemen?” Upon my word, I
don t know, except it be that so few gentlemen
are tenors. When you get your little pin through
the butterfly of talent you very seldom find your
prize meek and lowly, or even endurable. So
far as most p ;op!e have observed, the better the
tenor the worse (and fatter) the gentleman—which
is an apothegm holding good from the days of
the portly old-time Italian Australian favorite,
who used to muzzle two ducks and two bottles of
wine for his dinner, and whose carryings-on were
something awful—so I am credibly informed by
somebody's elderly relatives.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Sydney Royal was tilled to its topmost
pinnacle when Maggie Moore made her re-appear-
ance as ‘Little Jack Sheppard,” and the great,
heaving mass of humanity cheered and breathed
and blew violently and handed up great masses of
botany to its returned favorite. Slid The Bul-
letin almost regrets its enthusiastic statement of
last week to the effect that “J. Sheppard ” is the
best of all burlesques. The burlesque is certainly
as good as it was in die joyous days of old, and
the co., despite the absence of all the former stars,
is quite good enough. But this paper is older and
more cynical than it was, and its head stands up
further through its missing hair, and its corn fore-
tells the weather with more accuracy, and it finds
more difficulty in recovering its six-a-ponuy collar-
stud when it rolls behind the chest of drawers,
and it doesn’t revel in the burlesque as it once did.
In these former times it thought “Jack Shep-
pard ” better than it really was, and now it thinks
the same play worse than it really is, so the two
make a fair average. Maggie Moore, as a toler-
ably stout Jack, is, at all events, everything that
can be desired. No one ever filled the part better,
or looked more joyously rakish, or expressed
Jack’s historic desire to he “ wnss ” more
enthusiastically. Miss Moore’s singing-voice is in
fine order, and her new coster-ditty, “She an’l,
Me and ’Er,” is the sort of thing that will pre-
sently be barrel-organed all over Australia till it
drives the community to frenzy.

The versatile and beautiful H. R. Roberts
makes a thoroughly good Jonathan Wild, and is
somewhat suggestive of Lonnen in those rare
moments when that departed actor looked less
than usually like a cart-horse dragging coals up-
hill. He does not puff or perspire so much a, s
Lotmen—whose skin was the only part of hirp that
really acted well—but otherwise there is a resem-
blance. Oily Deering’s Blueskin, and Mendez, by
11. Daniels, are also unobjectionable. So are
several other people. A vast array of miscel-
laneous ladies, large, small, and middle-sized, are
mostly pleasing, an exception being made in dis-
favor _ot the gaunt maiden with black hair, and
the girl with a rush of paint to her eyes. No
well-regulated gin should put all the paint on the
upper part of her countenance. The clog ballet, and
the skirt dance of little Nellie Moore, are notably
excellent, and Hennings’ view of London Bridge
is one of the finest pieces of scene-painting imagin-
able. The Bulletin, however, desires to make
a number of coarse and disparaging remarks about-
the contortionist—contortionists are mostly very
much alike, and the spectacle of a prize di.slocater
struggling horribly with his head and feet jammed!
in a hoop, and later on dragging his hind-quarters-
painfully out of the same implement, is un-
pleasant. Some equally offensive observations are-
hereby applied to Ou.la, the clever trapezist, who>
is likewise remarkable and wearisome, and givem
to unpleasant dislocation. Dislocation is am
acquired taste, probably. Apart from this bone>-
destroying exhibition, however, “Jack Shep-
pard, ’ as seen at the Royal, is an affair with mucin
pretty music in it, and many pretty clothes, and!
at least 48 unexceptionable legs, and a large num-
ber of gratifying girls, and the man who expects
more than that probably expects the earth.
** * *
The “Case of Rebellious Susan ” ends at
Sydney Lyceum on Friday, and on Friday week
the Brough-Boucicault season also terminates.
Both these events are cause for serious regret.
The last week of the season is to be filled in with
“ An Ideal Husband,” a play which has boomed
considerably in a certain small island off the coast
of France, and which is the work of Oscar Wilde,
now unfortunately in gaol. This gentleman’s
name appeared on the preliminary advertisements,
but when he unfortunately got into gaol, and the
offer of his one remaining shady friend to bail him
out was treated with contempt, and he seemed in
a fair way—if only Botany Bay law prevailed in
England— to get twenty-five years in irons and
seventeen floggings, it was removed, and “ An
Ideal Husband ” appears in the advt. without an
author. The Bulletin, however, believes iu
giving every man credit for his work, therefore it
takes this opportunity to mention that the new
play is by Oscar Wilde, now unfortunately in
gaol. Several other new dramas by the same
talented _ writer, now unfortunately in gaol, are
running in London and will probably be seen here
a little later.
* * «*
“ Called Back ” ends its career at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) this (Thursday) evening, and
therefore the public has just one more chance to
see Mr. Rignold’s fine rendering of Paolo Macari,
and to profit thereby, A special matinee in aid
of the hospital funds was announced for Wednes-
day last, and The Bulletin trusts that the cash
results were magnificent, especially as G. Rignold
is always the most prompt of all managers to sub
scribe his big, four-act drama in the sacred cause
of charity. On Good Friday evening the indigest-
able hot-cross bun is to be alleviated and mollified
by a performance of Handel’s “ Creation*” when
the North Sydney Orchestral Society will let
itself loose 250 strong; and “Faust” commences
on Saturday. The Bulletin cordially recom-
mends “Faust” as a thrilling, convincing, and
strictly moral production with a valuable devil in
it, and, despite the strong counter attraction of the
new Lyceum drama by Oscar Wilde, now unfor-
tunately in gaol, it ought to find a favorable
opening.
** * *
The Most-Travelled Smythe’s very latest
lion is Parson H. R. Havveis, who gives his first
lecture to-night (Thursday) at Sydney School of
Arts. The subject is “Music and Morals,” and
the five succeeding subjects include “The Church
in the Catacombs,” “Tennyson,” “Marriage : Is
it a Failure,” and “Music and Noise.” Parson
Haweis, though a great favorite in London, hasn’t
been advertised throughout the world so wildly as
Talmage, therefore he is probably several degrees
better than that shriekful incumbent. The Sydney
season lasts six nights only, Parson Haweis beingr
in great haste to get home.

The shapely and charming Marie LuelTa—
she of the heavenly legs and the poetic bust—is to
h”K' n appearing at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday.
Mr. Rickards has borrowed Sweet Marie from
Williamson and Musgrove, and she will be
delivered on Saturday, and a receipt taken for her.
said document being given up again when she i'i
returned. Her appearance at the Tivoli will be
brief, and when she departs again there will be
a hollow void which even the Dandy Colored
Coons won tbe able to fill. Her engagement will
most likely prove an ill - advised proceeding.
Marie will educate the Tivoli audiences to demand
a higher-olass of legs in the future, and Rickards
will have to supply them at enormous cost, or else
liis popularity will suffer.
** * *
The Lyric Operatic and Variety Co. an-
nounces t lat it intends opening a season at Svdnev
Opera House on Saturday. The bones of'many
other companies lie at the do >r of the Opera
House, and The Bulletin, if it had any money
to lose, would just about as soon open its season
hy personally calling Johnel Sullivan a liar. Still,
there is no accounting for tastes. The Newhury-
Spada Co. gives high-class concerts at Sydney
Town-hall on Good Friday and Easter Monday.
The Fisk Jubilee Singers begin a three-nights
season at the Centenary Hall, York-street, also
on Friday, but the shadow of the dark and dys-
peptic bun is on all these shows, and they start
under gloomy auspices.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for. by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory mav be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
effect of them when they fill the stage is as of a
moral stink oozing through the pores of an ean de

At Melb. Bijou, last Saturday, the light
comedy of “ A Scrap of Paper” was supplemented
by a remarkable exhibition of Miss Amy Roselle’s
dramatic force. With the aid of a careful stage-
setting and an effective “make-up,” Miss Roselle
interpreted Tennyson’s poem, “ Rizpah,” wherein
a dying old woman devotes her last moments to
a weird description of how she filched the
bones of her boy from the gibbet after long years
of hanging, and planted them in a nice respectable
cemetery by the light of the pale moon. This fine
monologue entertainment was understood to be
given in honor of the Austral Salon ; and about a
hundred simpering salongites, ranged around the
dress-circle, made a faint pretence of having en-
joyed an intellectual feast. The remainder of
the audience gave the actress a great double call
after the crazy mother had died in her chair.
“A Scrap of Paper”—in which Miss Roselle,
Arthur Dacre, and theco. generally have improved
upon their first attempt concludes to-night
(Thursday). “Man and Woman,” one of the
Dacres’ recognised London successes, is to be staged
on Saturday, when the outbreak of new shows in
Melbourne will compare with the Easter competi-
tion of ancient times.

At the Princess’ the fourth Gaiety Com-
pany present its spicy musical comedy, “ A
Gaiety Girl,” to Australian notice. About
20 more or less new forms and faces are included
in the full strength of this invasion, and the first
appearance of some of the ladies will explain why
a posse of police used to guard their exit from the
stage-door of Daly’s Theatre, New York. The
fact is, the police drove the poor johnnies back
in order that they, the mynpidons of the
law, might secure an uninterrupted gloat for
themselves. Messrs. Williamson and Mus-
grove announce that prices of admission to
the Princess’ during the Gaiety season will be
the same as usual— after 7.45 p.m., by which time
the management hopes to find the theatre invari-
ably packed with people who have paid a shilling
extra all round. Indeed, the outlook for any
economical person who hopes to save the odd
shilling is rather gloomy, and in the interests of a
plucky venture The Bulletin hopes that ordinary
prices will never get a ghost of a show for the
next seven weeks. The man who can look
cautiously at a “bob” before rushing to inspect
“ A Gaiety Girl ’’ has absolutely no soul.

Bland Holt promises to make melodra-
matic history at the Theatre Royal by producing
his massive spectacles on the popular-prices sys-
tem, “The Span of Life,” with all its original
furniture and fittings, and blood-curdling sensa-
tions, has been shipped from Sydney and will open
the Bland Holtian campaign next Saturday (13th).
Melbourne is quite ready for another of these
periodical visitations, and the Royal is the old
home where they can always reckon on a warm
reception.

A cheerful complaint that the programme
contains too many "turns,’’and offers more variety
than people expect to get for their money, is the
only objection urged against the present course of
events at Meib. Opera House. On Saturday the
audience overflowed into standing room only, as
usual. Among several fresh arrivals, Horace
Wheatley and Miss Marie Luella distinguished
themselves by singing a wearisome ditty apiece.
However, in other respects they rose to the occa-
sion, and a sick song is ea-ily changed for a more
robust article. At the Oxford, a severe cold on
the chest prevented James Norrie from warbling
more than one husky verse the other night, but a
timely application of poultices and gargle will no
doubt bring the tenor round again by Easter.
** * *
Another special event for Saturday next is
“Don Juan, Junior,” at the Cambridge. That
excellent comedian, D’Arcy St infield, has engaged
a competent company to keep the lamp of bur-

fascinating ballet, entitled “The Nautchy Girls,”
is expected to make hair grow upon the baldest

Hamilton's Circus and Water Pantomime
will compete with the host of attractions afore-
stated. This circus, which occupies the classic
site on the St. Kilda-road, adjoining Princes’
Bridge, where Fillis pitched his tent, claims to be
the sole possessor of exclusive features for children.
Professor Hyland, supported by 50 horses, and a
pony that plays euchre and palms the right bower
with its hoof, is a leading item. The strongest
man on earth will also assist, in addition to extra-
ordinary people and things far too numerous to
mention. This last remark applies to sundry
other shows dotted around Melbourne and suburbs.

Mr. Nathan Herman, of 9 Wynyarcl-st.,
has started a new industry in Sydney. Every
tailor, bootmaker, dressmaker, shirtmaker, or
other tradesman, occasionally makes misfits whioh
are left on his hands by his disgusted customers.
He can seldom find another person whom these
misdirected goods will suit, for they are built to
aeree with the shape or shapelessness of one cus-
tomer, and out ot one man’s small supply it is
seldom that another customer can find an article
which will exactly adapt itself to his own par-
ticular departure from perfection. Mr. Herman,
therefore, buys these rejected articles in large
quantities from all over the country, and by get-
ting a huge stock together he can generally find
one article which will exactly adapt itself to any
client, unless the client is an absolute freak
and no other such freak was ever created,
ihe goods are sold at about half the
usual prices, and the result is satisfactory to
all parties. Mr. Herman undertakes to supply a
good suit of clothes, four shirts, six pairs socks,
two ties, two collars, six handkerchiefs, one set
studs, hat, braces and boots for £2, which about
tops tile records. He also sells carpets, linoleums,
rugs, mats, clocks, knives, forks, spoons, guns,
revolvers, gold and silver watches and jewellery,
safes, tea, and many other articles at wholesale
prices, or less. The tea isn’t a misfit —no one but
an aesthete gets measured for Ins tea—but it and
the jewellery, etc., go at misfit rates like every-
thing els*. Altogether, Mr. Herman should have
a wide field of usefulness before him.
The Wild-Cat Column,
The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
issues a balance-sheet which is, in every respect, much
belter than that of last year. The total income for 1894
is .£392,483, which is about £3OOO more than in 1893, and
the receipts from interest on investments are nearly
■187,000, an improvement of £6OOO compared with the
previous year. The expenses, in 1890, were equal to
£25 4s. percent, on the total income ; in 1892, they were
£2l 14s. percent... and in 1893, £2l 11s. percent. ; they
are now only £2O 4s. per cent., which is a substantial
reduction, especially at a time when the difficulty of
Obtaining business makes expenses tend rather to
increase. In many offices, in fact, they are increasing
materially, and the Colonial Mutual is, therefore an
honorable exception. The rate of interest realised on
investments is also a shade better than last year—another
unusual circumstance. The total funds have increased
dnrinj; 1894 by £131,327, and are now close on t 1,800,000.
Also, a larger amount of the money is being invested in
Uovt. debentures, and less is going into the item of
morses.” which is a good feature, mortgages being a
difficult asset to realise in times of sudden and violent
depnssion.
The Colonial Mutual doesn’t yet follow the wise
system of showing overdue interest separate ly from in-
terest accrued Last balance-sheet reported that no less
titan £55,000 of interest was accrued or in arrear, which
suggested that the investments were in rather a had con-
dition, and that the pound of flesh was difficult to collect.
iofl B A,m ear ’ j'o* ever . the amount has diminished to
£2o.()00, and the outstanding premiums and agents’
balances have also been largely reduced, which is
eminently reassuring. If the arrears were shown as a
separate item, as they certainly ought to be, it might
possibly be even more reassuring. Altogether the
balance-sheet of the Colonial Mutual is one of the'most
gratifying documents of its kind which has come to hand
this year. This office charges about the lowest premium
rates in Australasia, and it is the only Australian life
office which has successfully invaded Great Britain, and
wrested premiums from J. Bull in his native lair.

If the N.S.W. civil servants can secure the
abolition of the present dishonest and utterly bankrupt
Superannuation Fund, and get in its stead a "Life Assur-
ance Society of their own, in which every public servant
shall he compelled to insure his life for a certain mini-
mum sum, with the option of increasing the policy to any
amount, they will have a splendid opportunity In fore
them. The society would require no branches. It would
have no a«rents—the Treasury would stop the premiums
out of each man's salary and hand them over. It would
pay no commissions. It could afford to invest all ils funds
in Govt, securities, and thus save a vast amount of worry,
expense, and risk of depreciation. It would have a hu e
business from the first day of it, s existence, with no risk
of any falling off, and it would have Government super-
vision of its accounts as a guarantee that all was right.
Such a concern could keep its expenses down to three per
cent, of receipts, and, if it charged the same rates as the
A.M.P. and issued the same policies, it could pay bhrg r
bonuses than that big office, or any other in Anst aliiTor
out of it. Then hy-and-hve the public would want to get
into this favored institution, and it would be trans-
formed into a State Life Insurance Department for the
benefit of the community at large. Tne service appar-
ently doesn’t realise what an opportunity lies before it.

F. : If I wore autocrat of Australia I would
make an attempt to get into circulation th ■ private board-
ings of Vic. and N.S.W., which must now amount to at
least £3,090,000. I would try legal-tender deb ntiires
bearing interest at a low rate—say 2 p u r cent. Tnese
debenlures would be issued in any de emulation not less
than £5, and.the interest would be payable half-yearly to
the holder of the debenture on demand. No one would
need to board with snob an investment possible, and the
security would be perfectly liquid. The debentures co dd
always be used, direct, as a substitute for cash, and the
half-yearly dividends would keep them from becoming a
glut under any circumstances. As government I would
apply the proceeds to buying up Australian slock in
London. Who votes for me as autocrat ?

The Union Trustee Co. of Australia (Melb.)
rep >rts having earned £3649 during the past year, which
provides a 4 per cent, div., and leaves £7OO over. Appa-
rently the pr .fit is mostly interest derived from the
investment of the shareholders’ own capital, and the
trustee business, after paying expenses, yields next to
nothing. The Union. Trustee Co, has been 10 years in
existence, and seems to have accumulated no reserve-
fiind in all that period, and its balance-sheet is a rather
tired and unsuccessful-looking document.

The Anglo-Australian Investment, Finance and

The Colonial Bank of Maoriland has made a
net profit of £12,473, which is £4OOO less than that for the
last half-year. The div, drops from the accustomed seven
per cent, to six ; nothing is added to reserve ; and as the
div. absorbs £12,000, the bank “strengthens its position”
by adding just £473 to profit and loss. Altogether, the
Colonial seems to have struck a patch of bad luck some-
where.

James Mnnro’s unhappy Real Estate Bank has
so fur paid 2s. 3d. in the £to its creditors. Its remaining
liabilities to the public amount to £593,060. Against Ibis
it has more or less visible assets-some of them of a
rather doubtful charaoter-of £27,589. and whatever it
may he able to get out of the shareholders. The unpaid
capital, when the famous burst took place, was nominally
£500,000, and, despite the most vigorous and vociferous
efforts at collection, £370,000 of this hasn’t yet come in.
Probably the most of this represents the amount owing
by hopelessly busted creditors. Most of the creditors who
are of any value have probably paid up bv now. If this
is so, a few more small divs. will wind up the affair for
good.

The liquidator of a Melb. property co. told the
story of the liquidation in court the other day. It
sounded like a slab from Mark Twain’s “ Innocents
Abroad.” The 00. consisted mostly of one man. When
it suspended, the general impression was that it would
be able to pay off all its debts, but it didn’t. In fact, it
seems uncertain whether it paid any of them. After five
years’ hard liquidation the wit ness called a final meeting.
No one attended but himself, and by virtue of some
proxies he moved and seconded and carried that the 00.
be finally dissolved and the books and documents de-
stroyed. They were accordingly burnt in the liquidator’s
wash-house. The proxies by which the resolution to
burn the hooks was carried were .also burnt, likewise the
minute-book containing the resolution. Therefore, there
only remained the liquidator’s own statement that there
ever had been any proxies or any resolution. The
vouchers, it would appear, were likewise destroyed,
so it was impossible to say exactly where the money
went. The books were never audited. The liquidation
paid no div., but the unaudited books being now ashes it
was impossible to show the exact reason why this was
so. So the Court looked helplessly at itself and the
examination closed. It was obviously impossible to do
anything more, unless it burned the liquidator, and
no one had sufficient originality to suggest that.

The Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank, of
Melbourne, reports that it has made a loss of £5632 for
the half-year. During the previous half-year it made a
profit of £5097, so the falling off in the last six months is
over £10,700. At the previous meeting a 2 per cent. div.
was announced on preference shares, bur. this time the
painful subject is not even mentioned. Since June, ’94,
the institution has foreclosed on £197,090 worth of
mortgaged property, and has only sold £5OOO worth. Its
total investments amount to about £1,500,000, and of this
£730.000 is producing no interest whatever, anel the
remainder pans out at the rate of about 4 per cent, per
annum. The usual steps are being taken to reduce the
interest on the reconstructed deposits and debentures.

According to a London wire, as the result of a

Th«n they recovered lo 235. 91 ; but, at latest, bad

pooled, an! when 60,000 were lately sold by one p rty

In a word, it is wired that Lord Fing.all (now
at Coolgardie) reports, per cable to London, that (tie big
gold shoot at the Londonderry mine, which was scab d
down so solemnly when the purchase was completed, has
cut right out in one Shot! The “greatest mine on earth ”
lias been “ spoilt with a pick ”in one act. As the lenglh
of a “jeweller’s shop” is s u ldom much more than its
depth, this is indeed a crusher. Barley's Proprietary
also evidently having bottomed, Coolgardie wild-cnt
specul lion may be regarded as having been hit on the
point of the jaw.
The Parisian shareholders are howling loudly,
but they will howl even more loudly still when they find
out the quality of one or two other Coolgardie ventures
in which they have embarked lately. Meanwhile, Lord
Fingall and Col. North, the arch-’Derry promoters, who
are evidently much surprised, are behaving squarely and
decently, as they promise to sacrifice all their own interest
in and profits out of the concern in the event of the
scrip holders not having a fair run for their money.
The prudent Londonderry finders must ho con-
gratulated on the way in which they conducted th"tr deal
as regards cash. That they should still hold 116,000
scrip (out of a total of 700,000) amongst them is a fact on
which they are to be commiserated.
In the famous golden-hole they now have only
“ battery-rock ’’—like Bayley’s ?

The latest “solution of the sulphide problem,”
at Broken Hill, is the invention of late Chief-electrician
Ashcroft, of the Proprietary mine, who lias experimented
at. his private laboratory for years oast. It comprises the
extraction of the zinc, and its deposition in a metallic
state, by an electrical process, the ore being thus
rendered smeltahle. The satisfactory feature of the in-
vention is that the zinc—which, in Broken Hill sulphides,
sometimes amounts to 45 per cent.—is sat ed and forms a
valuable by-product. Mr. Ashcroft, to whom everyone
will wish good fortune; goes to Europe with his invention.
The jigging sulphide processes in operation at
Broken Hill are crude in results at best, and are lo be
enthused over only because there are none better as yet.
Very much stiver wastes in “ slimes” and tailings, while
the possibility of recovering the zinc is not contemplated
at all. The sulphide problem will not lie regarded as
solved until some process—which will probably not he
mechanical—is hit upon which will save the now execrated
zinc and turn the sulphides into a smelting ore without
casting away large quantities of the silver and lead in the
operation. Such the new' process claims to be.
Broken Hill has been the field of a large crop of
inventions, which range from sulphide processes to
devices for cutting butter into pounds and storing lemon-
ade without bottles. It was Ashcroft who, with Proprie-
tary general-manager Howell, evolved the Slag Steam
Generator—which generates no longer. The departed
fame of that invention is perpetuated in the usual scrip
and a “generator” which is rusting on one of the Pro-
prietary slag-dumps. Likewise, speculative Broken Hill
is reminded hy the existence of bundles of scrip of a once-
famous explosive of local invention which didn’t explode
much after the first public trial.
The departure of several highly-placed officials
from the Proprietary mine lately evidences the fact that
the new king who knows not Joseph is moving round. It
is generally thought that Mr. Howell has gone tor good,
and that assistant-general manager Stewart’s title will
shortly be worn without the prefix.

From a Tasmanian paper:—“The proposed
Sale of the Tasmania mine, the negotiations for which are

will be, if not very dense, struck with the foresight of
that astute Welshman, Mr. W. T. Jones, who name over
to our races, took a run flown to Beacousficld, saw the
mine, purchased 1000 shares in it at £7 10a., and now
offers, on behalf of a syndicate, I presume, £l2 per share
for every share in the mine, his own 1000 included, which
on his first transaction in this connection givei him a
profit of t’4soo,'while he will, no douht, float the mine in

The West Australian Prospecting Association (Ballarat)
look' das good as anything on paper. The £lOOO sub-
scribed was to tie invested in the efforts out west of
five favorably-known men, selected by a reputable
directorate. The prospectors themselves were to be
investors, and every reasonable precaution was taken that
the public should get a run for its money. The prospectors
came hack from Westraha, without the gold, and with a
little quarrel of their own. [f a man has any incompati-
bility in him Weslralia will bring it to the surface—and
tlte leader of this party did not come scatheless from the
test. However, all the five were penalised for returning
without leave. In their work they traversed Coidinhap,
Fanny’s Cove, Moir’s Rock, Esperance and Dnndas Hill
at a gross expenditure of £-440. The association is to ba
wound up and shareholders will get back half their invest-
ment—which is a bel ter state of affairs than can be as-
cribed to other companies this column has heard about.

Vic. Government Gazette contains names of
members of hoard of inquiry into the working of the
Insolvency Act—lsaacs, Best and Williamson. Much is
to he done here, especially in re deeds of assignment for
the benefit of creditors, which at present are hardly

appointed trustees have practically a free hand in mop-
ping up the assets. The position of married women as
secret transferees of their husband's property needs look-
ing into. Compulsory registration of deeds of a-s'gn-

Tonic in every newspaper I took up, I resolved to
get a bottle. I did so, and by the time I had
finished the third bottle I was thoroughly cured
of all disagreeable symptoms. If ever I feel out of
sorts, I fly to Clements Tonic, and I am happy to
say I am never disappointed. If I was to write for
a month I could not say more in favor of Clements
Tonic, though I am a thorough believer in it.—l

To Doctor Creed, M.L.0., of N.S. Wales,
arch cremation-spouter: Dear Doctor, when is
your little oven to be ready?
The chummy daughter of a certain Aus-
tralian ex-Speaker slaps her Pa on the back and
calls him Tom, just like any other fellow.
Miss E. A. Badham’s essay on woman’s
suffrage, read before N.S.W. Economic Associa-
tion, does credit to the daughter of her father.
Melbourne sassiety has much to say con-
cerning the peculiarities of one of its latest recruits.
In the first place, the lady smokes vigorously.
Bishop Hale, late of Brisbane, who has
died in London, was for over 40 years a resident
in Australia, and throughout the whole period a
warm friend to the aborigines.
Melb. air is thick with
Hopetoun stories just now. Most
of them, too, tend to develope
the Presbyterian- elder side of the
boy-Governor’s character. Not
only the pious side, either.
Melbournian : “ Hay ter,
worthy and industrious, excel-
lent citizen, had a purely official
and entirely unscientific, mind.
He seemed to look on Victoria
as the Universe. He could not
rise at all into the higher atmo-
sphere of statistics. Buckle
acutely shows the kinship be-
tween the poetic mind and that
of lofty generalisation. Hayter
fancied he was a poet, but was
really worse than even Fitz-
gibbon. Who can ever forget
that wondrous aboriginal epic ?
Walt Whitman, Hiawatha, and
Tupper danced before the
reach r’s vision. Hayter cared
not for the statistics of Quetelet,
and such great masters. No—
not to be offensive to a man
wo all liked, and merely speak-
ing in a scientific way— his sordid
ideas of statistics were what
he stupidly called practical.
Stupid, in narrowing his mind
down to this inferior plane
only. But we need an endow-
ment of science, wherefore
Hayters nail their minds down
to their thousand a year, or
whatever it is.”
J. M. Black, a reporter on the staff of
S. A. Advertiser, can take a shorthand-note of a
speech given in either English, French, or German.
According to a Sydney daily, Louis Becke
wishes to return to the Islands, but Mrs. Becke
objects. Madame has perhaps been reading “By
Reef and Palm.”
Melbournian: ‘ ‘ Met Rev. Kinmaker Kins-
man to-day. Still flourishing. Still has that
delicious and delirious little sofa, on which so
many thousand ’Appy Guppies has sat.”
If St. John Topp, of Vic. bar, becomes a
Supreme Court Judge—as is likely some day—
he’ll be the first man who ever went on the bench
without braces, or with a silver watch-chain.
In Melb. they are telling a hilarious
story in which the chief figures are a cacchinating
politician, Gov. Hopetoun, a vegetable curio, and
a number of more or less beauteous charwomen.
Chief Peterswald, of the S.A. police, has
grim notions in the matter of holiday-keeping.
His present leave of absence is being occupied by
an inspection of the penal system of New Cale-
donia.
Mr. Justus Scharff, The Bulletin hears,
is the bearer to Prince Bismarck, on behalf of the
Sydney Germans, of a birthday present, consist-
ing of a magnificent centre-piece composed of solid
silver and emu-eggs.
Charles Gavan Duffy took Oscar Wilde’s
mother (“ Speranza ”) to be a man for long during
the early part of her contributions to his Dublin
journal, The Nation, and expressed much
astonishment when disillusionised.
Superintendent George Reid, of N.S.W.
police, who presently retires upon pension, is one
of a few remaining of the original 40 London
police, who came to Sydney in the ship Bangalore
m ’55, to form the nucleus of the present force.
Mr. J. M. Waterhouse, now living in
Maoriland, enjoys the unique distinction of having
been Premier both of that province and of South
Australia. He once sat in Parliament with
Hori Grey, who has been Governor of the same
two provinces.
Acting-Gov. Madden (Vic.), who sadly
misses the old boxing-days, is undergoing a course
of massage to resist his tendency towards exces-
sive stoutness. A masseur now attends at the
Law Courts, and kneads “the Chief’s”portly body
during luncheon-hour.
Lord Kintore’s term of office as S.A.
Governor expires Thursday, April 11. Out of
the six years for which he was nominally ap-
pointed in ’B9, more than 18 months, either on full
or half-pay, have been spent in holiday-making in
England or the other provinces.
Mr. C. B. Fisher, who lately failed in
Melbourne for more than half a million, is a son
of J. Hurtle Fisher, the first Resident Commis-
sioner of the S.A. Co. in Adelaide. He and
Captain Hindmarsh, the earliest Governor, quar-
relled, and, as a consequence, both lost their posi-
tions.
Treas. Holder, who ratified the appoint-
ment of Miss Gordon as superintendent of night-
nu'srs at Adelaide Hospital, is chairman of the
“Independent” Board of Enquiry which has
been appointed to ascertain whether undue
favoritism was shown towards her by the Hospital
Board or her brother, Chief Secretary Gordon.
Judge Williams, who was the first Vic-
torian u, submit his Income-tax schedule, had it
returned to him the following day as informal !
Ex-Judge Lilley’s application for a vote under the
existing Q. Electoral Act was similarly marked
informal. For exactly what proportion of judi-
cial acumen should wig and tipstaff take credit?
Journalist : “Pastor Fitchett must see
that Stead placed him in a false position as RE-
VIEW op Reviews editor. He has to put forth
that audacious notice of Grant Allen’s “Woman
Who Did ” with what is, from the pietist stand-
point, copious salacity of connected,
according to the familiar reviewing-trick, by short
bits of protest.”
A new beauty of the first magnitude has
arisen down South. She is Miss Lilian Wheeler,
and is most divinely-fair, with a Rathbonesque
figure, and —so some photographers declare —
the most perfect “ subject ”in Melb. The young
lady is a daughter of the late Mrs. Wheeler, a
brilliantly-clever woman, who for years edited and
ran the Castlemaine Times “ on her own.”
Oscar Wilde has undoubtedly done
much to brighten British middle-class life. He
quickened the public appreciation of beauty in
art, and diffused a taste for intellectual culture

He wants to scratch his head.
where formerly it was held in vulgar contempt.
The young Oscar did this. The world is all the
better for young Oscar, and even middle-aged
Oscar may serve as a shocking example of culohaw
gone mad.
An illustrious scientist was picknicked the
other day by a somewhat distinguished party,
including several ladies, in the wilds of the Heales-
ville mountains. The company assembled at
Princes Bridge station, and, as they did not
return to town till the Monday, their portmanteau
arrangements were quite elaborate. The time of
starting approached, and anxious glances were
cast around by the august assemblage ; their guest
had not arrived. Just as the last bell rang, the
quaint-looking little man strolled on to the plat-
form, arrayed in a seedy-looking old dress-suit
(which he wore all next day, by the way), while
his wardrobe consisted solely of the contents of a
flaring red handkerchief! Scieoe ■ in I simplicity !
Melbourne’s amateur musi-
cal world, more especially the
Jewish half of it, has been look-
ing forward with lively interest
to the appearance of Miss
Flegeltaub at the Princess’s.
Two performances of “ Pina-
fore,” in aid of the local Jewish
charities, were arranged for
April 10th and 11th. On the
latter evening Miss Flegeltaub
was to take the chief soprano
character (Josephine) in suc-
cession to Miss Orelli, a young
amateur who would probably
givethe other lady a great chance
to suffer by comparison. Miss
Flegeltaub, however, carries the
full confidence of Ballarat
where she lately showed her
quality in “Pirates of Pen-
zance. ”
H. : “ President Fifcchetfc,
head of the Wesleyan Confer-
ence, has received so much
criticism that a per-contra may
be attempted. The attacks on
him have been thoroughly pub-
lic, and yet a large majority
makes him president, as against
Bickford, the cut-and-dried man.
The fact is the intelligent mem-
bers of the denomination have
faced the bearings, and argue
that it pays them to retain Mr.
Fitchett, who does their work
in an unexceptionable manner.
As journalist, he is not on the
same footing as the civil ser-
vant, or university professor,
because nobody contributes to
his ecclesiastical salary unless
he chooses. The journalists
with whom he competes are not debarred from
entering into any other bu-dmss, and many do
so. They may even preach and be paid for it.”
A genial and able clergyman, who was
drummed out ( f a certain Australian church, a few
years ago, for conduct unbecoming “a Christian
and a minister ” —such conduct consisting of a too
lax regard for the seventh commandment—has
since found much acceptance with another de-
nomination, with which he is in demand as
a preacher; and it is more than likely he will be
nominated for its ministry at a yet-to-be-held
annual gathering.
George Dean, found guilty of attempting
to poison his wife at North Shore, Sydney, kept
his nerves remarkably steady while the Judge
lectured and sentenced him on Saturday night,
but had lost his appetite from the commencement
of the trial, and shook almost to pieces when the
ordeal was over.
Parkes is blamed for not using his influ-
ence towards the release from prison of his old
friend Abigail; but the latter’s sympathisers may
rest assured that Parkes’ influence in that direc-
tion would go fcr naught. The absence of the
Judge’s consent kept murderer Bertrand in gaol
for 28 years, and unless the Judge who tried and
sentenced M’Namara and Abigail relents, the pair
will probably serve their full term, allowing fur
good-conduct remissions.
The first personal information published
in Adelaide re Mr. Harmer, the new bishop, is a
twaddlesorne extended account of his marriage to
a Miss Cocks, and a long list of the wedding-pre-
sents. The lady is quite an aristocrat, having an
earl for a grandfather, and the very appropriate
motto of their family is “To be useful and not
conspicuous.” It is a coincidence that the retiring
bishop (Dr. Reunion) married a sister of baronet
Fergusson between Ins acceptance of the bishopric
of Adelaide and his consecration.
The Mayoresses of Ballarat, East and
West, waylaid the vanishing Hopetouns at tha
railway-station and handed the Countess a bouquet
between them with best wishes for her welfare on
her return to Bonnie Scotland. Lady H., the
typical Irish girl, didn’t half appreciate this refer-
ence to Bonnie Scotland. She hates thistles and
haggis and bagpipes and Caledonian “gags” in
general, and on one or two occasions when some-
body called her lord “a braw Soot,” Lady Hope-
toun has been seen to smile peculiarly.
Ex-Premier Morehead (Q.), who re-married
the other day in Brisbane, began life as a Sydney
bank-clerk. He hopes to be Premier again, some-
day—a not very presumptuous hope among such a
crowd of politicians as fall about up there. More-
head has been a widower for five years, and great
has been the speculation—even in the most exalted
(Bananaland) circles—as to where his handkerchief
would fall. Miss Seymour, daughter of the Com-
missioner of Police, has now become mistress of
the charming homestead at Dalveen, near War-
wick.
Mannington Caffyn, many Australians
will deeply grieve to hear, was seriously ill, a mail
or two ago, with something that looks very like
paralysis. This reads like a continuation of his
life-liistory. He had a bad attack of scurvy when
he was walking the hospitals. Through this, he
first met with his wife—then a nurse at St.
Thomas’, London. Through it, too, he lost the
whole of his right jaw. It is not generally known
that he had a false one, which he would sometimes
take out, piece by piece, for the benefit of his
friends, to illustrate the triumphs of surgery.
If Brunton Stephens ever reads “ The
Godolphiu Arabian ” (just re-issued by Watson,
Ferguson and Co. in a charming pocket-edition),
he must be surprised to notice how bright he was
in ’72, before inexorable Time and the drudgery of
the Chief Secretary’s office had dulled his pen and
deadened his imagination. Ekeu, fwjaces! “The
Godolphin ” was presumably omitted from “ Con-
vict Once and Other Poems ” as beneath the
dignity of the Muse ; but it is a very readable,
quotable jeu d’esprit, cleverly versified, and its
gaiety shouldn’t debar its insertion. If Byron
could risk “Don Juan.” Brunton Stephens might
surely venture “The Godolphin?” At all events.

its 12 cantos have been out of print so long
that they are almost out of memory, and it is
right to give them a chance to renew old friend-
ships and make new ones. The Bulletin only
notes one misprint of an apparently faulty line
(6, verse 17, part 5).
“Dr.” Myers, a well-known N.Q. jour-
nalist of the early days, died at Charters Towers
recently, aged 76. His “beat’’ was the district
round Cooktown, Port Douglas, Cairns, and Her-
berton, where he healed men’s bodies and en-
lightened their minds with characteristic vigor.
Twenty years ago the little lame doctor was a
combative soul, and would tackle any man with
pen, or lancet, or horsewhip. Many Hodgkinson
pioneers have reason to bless “old Dr. Myers,”
who possessed an excellent medical instinct. He
had lived in many lands, and was for years teak
dtsat in Lima.

Mr. PERCY SPENCE.
Percy F. S. Spence follows B. E. Minns
across the big water, and The Bulletin regret-
fully waves a valedictory pen to another of its
artists. Mr. Spence has done much good illustra-
tion-work for this paper and others, and N.S.W.
Art Gallery and several private collections con-
gratulate themselves on possessing more per-
manent tokens of his talent, in the shape of oil-
paintings which some day—who knows?—greedy
foreign connoisseurs may cover with sovereigns.
Anyhow, Mr. Spence is chookfull of energy and
brimfull of facility, and his draftsmanship—the
foundation of art —is commended by eveiy critic.
This paper wishes him much fame ami many
commissions, and invites the contributors to its
amateur art gallery to furnish his successor if they
can.
Melb. Supreme Court library is to be no
longer without a picture of George Higinbotham.
One 7ft. x sft. has just been completed by Ber-
nard Hall. The artist was at the disadvantage of
having to work from a photo., and, also. The
Bulletin believes, of never having seen his sub-
ject in life. Nevertheless, a good portrait has
been painted of the official phase of Higinbotham’s
features. Most of. the picture consists of red
robes, wig and ermine, more emblematic of the
justice sprinkled with blood of the Criminal Court
than of the gentle character of their portrayed
wearer.
When The Bulletin originally published
Louis Becke’s “ By Reef and Palm ” stories, it
knew that they would be the means of sending
many a man to South Sea vagabondage. Mr. and
Mrs. Soley (Rose de Boh&me), whose cultured and
forceful pens are well-known in Sydney journal-
ism, have fallen victims to that book : they are off
to the South Seas to secure the departed Steven-
son's mantle—to which Mr. Soley, as the man of
all men with possibly the closest facial resem-
blance to the dead novelist when in the flesh, has
an undoubted claim. “They were going they
knew not where,”’ said Mr. S. to a circle of
friends at a little dinner the other night-
just intending, in fact, to toddle round
the edge of nowhere till they found a little isle of
their own, with some coral, and crabs, and cocoa-
nuts, and a few picturesque natives to bring them
fish and mats and call them “Tusitala.” By-and
by they might come back to civilisation —they
were not sure. Rather a misty pair of pilgrim-,
one thinks, to go prowling round the infinite.
However, The Bulletin wishes them luck, and
suggests that the subscription to bring them back
be paid in advance.

stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile, and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.

Gov. Hopetoun and His Excellency, Chief
Justice Madden go halves in the Vic. vice-regal
salary.
“The N.S.W. system of Government is a
democracy tempered by dominoes.”— Sunday
Times.
Attorney-General Want appears to enjoy
helping Premier Reid to mature an absolutely
Ereetrade tariff as intensely as he enjoyed help-
ing Premier Jennings to impose a 5 per cent, ad
valorem duty.
Premier Turner (Vic.) has been somewhat
ill of late through overwork and worry, and it is
commonly reported that the British Government
proposes to take advantage of his feeble condition
to make him a knight.
It is alleged that “ Toby ” Barton’s tem-
porary judgeship has knocked on the head the
proposed attempt to prove payment of members
illegal in N.S.W. Mr. Barton, it is said, was
retained for the Banco argument.
Brassey, with his everlasting prattle of
war and battle ships, will be a very objectionable
Australian Governor. But Democracy prefers
objectionable elderly Governors to sickly young
men who “make themselves popular with all
classes.”
George Black, M.P., seems to have lapsed
into political atrophy. It was expected that
buoyed with the confidence which re-election
ffives he would have shown even better debating
capacity than in his first N.S.W. Parliament. Not
so, however.
To Parkes himself, the cruellest thing
about his downfall must be that the swarm of poli-
tical crawlers, who used to beslobber him when in
power, now beslobber his successful rival with the
same greasy pertinacity. After all, Wise has a
redeeming quality peeping through his political
insincerity — viz., gratitude.
Dilke’s Suffrage Bill proposes to establish
a single franchise at all elections, to abolish uni-
versity representation, and to remove the dis-
abilities of women. It is composed of four succinct
clauses, applies to local as well as to parliament-
ary elections, and repeals the disqualification
which rests on women in respect to membership of
Parliament.
“Our fathers bade us beware
of sudden conversions, and all over

Queensland Civil Service Act
directs that in the annual reports of
the service the names and ages 01 all
officers shall given. The few latest
reports have appeared correct m every
particular, with the exception of Z 1
omissions, relating to the ages of ZL
officers, who, occupying influential
positions, have quietly run their
small coach-and-four through the Act.
Some member should move that the
ages of these sensitive officials be
given in a special return.
In Maoriland, shop employ
who are paid by salary must be
allowed a half-holiday weekly, but
employes paid by commission don t
come under this rule. Therefore, in
Auckland, shopkeepers are beginning
to pay their employes by commission
on their sales, and another bene-
ficent law goes broke through Fat
Man’s oussedness. In the same pro-
vince it was enacted, a while ago,
that seats should be provided for
female shop-assistants ; the 1 at Man
provided them accordingly, but
ukased that any employe found sit-
ting on one of them would be in-
stantly “ sacked.” Now an attempt
is being made to enact that no
employer shall be to dis-
charge an assistant for sitting down
unless she sits for an unreasonable
length of time ; consequently she
won't be discharged for sitting down,
but as soon as she sits down will
be sacked for “incompetence,’ or
something of the same character.
Meanwhile, the usual sneer about
“grandmotherly legislation’’ goes
round the Conservative press, grand-
motherly legislation being another
term for the attempt to make Fat Man some-
what less of a hog by Act of Parliament. So
far, the attempt to make him any less of a hog,
either by Act of Parliament or otherwise, has
proved so futile that the sneer is almost deserved.
Dunedin, Maoriland, returns three extra-
Democratic members and two labor members in
the outskirts, yet the only morning paper there is
uncompromisingly Conservative.
Every member of N.S.W. Legislative
Council who took part in the debate on “ Dick"
O'Connor’s Disorderly Conduct Suppression Bill
supported the flogging clauses, Senator Macintosh
modifying his view so far as to ask for amend-
ment in such a way that the flogging would leave
no permanent mark upon the floggee’s cuticle 1
Thus Tom Coward, of North Queensland,
speaking in Adelaide before the Royal Commission
on the Northern Territory :—“ Kanakas are a lazy
lot of skunks. Europeans could do all the work
in connection with sugar-growing. In the long
run European labor was cheaper, because it was
better, and the climate would kill any coloured
labor in the world. ”
Q. Attorney-General, Tommy Byrnes,
speaking at Mt. Morgan to a well-culled
crowd of champagners, had the impudence to
hope that the young men of Queensland would
remember their debt to MTlwraith. Do the
young men of Queensland owe MTlwraith the
millions sunk in friend Drury’s bank, of which he
was a director and shareholder ?
The tenacious ex-Minister Lyne, despite
his wealth of explanations and his worship of
private enterprise, will probably lead the future
straight-out N.S.W. Protectionist party. He is
an avowed individualist in a House where there
are many masked individualists pirouetting in
democratic clothing, waiting for the reaction which
they anticipate will follow the new labor tactics.
Any Victorian attempting to make humor-
ous statements in his income-tax schedule is liable
to be fined .£5. Very few people noticed this
beneficent provision, and various individuals who
put scraps of verse into their returns, and drew
sketches of cats on the margin, and asked tho
commissioner where he bought that hat, and
things like that, feel a good deal depressed just
now.
The N.S.W. “ Solidarity ” party’s pledge,
amongst other things, provided that all questions
affecting monopolies or privileges, or the fate of a
Government, were to be submitted to a caucus and
the members were to vote as the majority decided.
How will this affect the position of a man who lias
not only taken the pledge at the general electnm,
but has taken a pub. since? Suppose the Solidarity
caucus decides against Liquidarity, how then ?
In the face of the almost unanimous
agreement of the text writers on public inter-
national law, that the policy of non-intervention
occupies as important a position in modern inter-
national practice as that of the balance of power
did in the previous era, it is amusing to read of
the gradual concentration of a strong British iron-
clad fleet in the China Sea, and of the presence
of a Russian fleet at Vladi vostock, and a powerful
Russian army on the very confines of Manchuria.
It is unfortunate, at the least, that Premier
Turner and Attorney-General Isaacs (Vic.)should
both have been professionally concerned in
the civil defence of the firm charged with
fraudulent gun sales. Mr. Turner has been in
court day after day as solicitor for the defence,
and Mr. Isaacs drew the pleadings. Both men
must have felt somewhat embarrassed when the

.Ex-Premier Parkes did not get over being
“euchred” out of his speech on the second read-
ing of N.b.W. Local Govt. Bill as calmly as
seemed the case to those who spoke with him
m the Assembly on the eventful night. He had
prepared a speech “ worthy of the occasion,’ but,
feeling weak and giddy, he went home early in a
cab, and had hardly got to bed before he was
attacked with an exceedingly-severe nervous
spasm, which his doctor said was due to high and
prolonged nervous tension. The veteran only now
begins to recognise that he is no longer young.
In appointing Alfred Stephen Lieut,-
Governor of N.S. Wales —to keep James Martin
out of an Acting-Governorship—the Imperial
authorities named the President of the Legislative
Council—then John Hay—as the person to hold
the Acting-Governorship in the absence of the

Governor and the absence or incapacity of the
Lieut.-Governor. Should Acting-Gov. Darley
vacate his office, John Lackey would be Acting-
Governor, not the senior puisne. Such,
however, is not the position in Victoria, where,
should Chief Justice Madden vacate the Acting-
Gov’ship, the senior puisne Judge, Williams, would
reign at Govt. House.
Sydney Daily Telegraph, discussing
Governors’ salaries, says: “The happy medium
is one which will enable the occupant of the vice-
regal office to fill it with dignity, but not to make
money out of it.’’ This is just as wrong as if one
should say, when a wages strike is on, that the
happy medium in the matter of wages is one which
will enable the worker to do his work capably but
allow him nothing to lay by. Supposing there
is enough real work attached to the billet to make
it advisable that there should be a Governor, then
there should also be enough salary to let him
save a little against his old age, when he will be
too much crippled by gout and liver-complaint to
govern any longer.
“The working-man must come down to
his market price.” “No unionism can endow
him with a value beyond that represented by his
services to his employer.” These and such like
are the keynotes of the competitive system; and
in Sydney E. News of March 26, the product of
the teaching comes out thus :
HANDY Man, for Small Poultry Farm, understand
horses, sober, good references, wages 7s. a
month. E., P. 0., Peakhurst.
To indicate the tyrannous social conditions of Eng-
land 70 years ago, the veteran Parkes tells how, at
nine years of age, he had to work for 4d._ a day.
Even allowing for “tucker,” the Australian serf
at 7s. a month is not, for adult work, better
circumstanced than was the English serf then ;
and only for unionism, with all its faults, the
English serf would be at his old level still.
The Tory vials of wrath are being poured
out down South in the matter of the wages paid
in the match-factory established there under tariff
protection. The manager, having told a reporter
that the girls engaged therein do not get less than
2s. per day, the amom t h s been taken as a war-
cry, and “two shillii gs a day ’ is confidently
asserted to be the standard wage under Protection,
It happens that the very same authority that now
condemns 2s. a day for a factory-girl only a few
weeks ago attacked the opponents of 4s. lid. a
day for man, horse and dray. It is because
Supply and Demand can do no wrong that the
said hideous wage to street-cleaners was upheld.
The nett amount coming to the man at this rate
would be 3s. a day- for the support of himself
and his family ! Eighteen shillings a week !
Compared with this the minimum match-factory
wage of 2s. a day for a girl, with only herself to
keep, is simply magnificent.
Yic. Works Minister Taverner has issued

The most characteristic item in such a schedule is
the wage for unskilled labor. It will be seen that
for “ Laborers ” Melbourne has gone Bd. better
than Sydney.
Premier Turner’s £500,000 deficiency for
1894-95 promises to turn up with a beautiful and
wonderful accuracy. Turner said he would be
that amount short if the land and income taxes
were not forthcoming. The income tax comes too
late to do much good this financial year, and the
land-tax was rejected. Probably Turner will also
be rejected next general election, The nation
cast out Gillies for his extravagance, and Spiels
for his efforts at retrenchment and other things,
and Patterson for his fatuous way of hoping for
better times, and it is quite likely it will cast out
Turner for expecting worse times.
Another at-

made to stir the
Vie. people out of
their disgusting
lethargy in the
matter of the local
Chinese monopoly

Melbourne, and
these only because
they are too im-
poverished to get

H. H. Cham-

“Public life does

How many

whom one would
care to choose to
act as executors of
one’s will, or trus-
tee tor one’s chil-
dren ? About
three, I should
think. Yet these
men have the con-
trol of the ready-
made machinery
for State social-
ism.” There’s no
want of decision
about Champion’s
utterances. “ Are
you in favor of a
State Bank?”
somebody asked
him'at an election
meeting. “ Not
until you return a respectable Parliament,” was
the answer.
The Argus really must keep a watchful
eye on its city editor, who is now calling into
question the doctrine of Competition—the princi-
pal member of the great Tory trinity, Competition
and Supply and Demand. Here are the wicked
words :
It must, of course, always be a moot point as to what
constitutes a living profit, but that does not make it Jthe
less certain that to sell under cost price is a positive loss,
destructive of trading capital, whether that of the re-
tailer himself or that of his wholesale houses, or that of
the banks, which in their turn, support the distributor.
Retailers who are trading on sound lines would be very
glad to be relieved from the unfair competition which
consists in cutting prices below the line of safety.
Of course this only refers to the retailer of
groceries. But if the Argus be not careful
the same arguments may be used about the re-
tailer of another commodity—Labor. That would
indeed be horrible.

“Every woman is at heart a rake.” But
only on Hospital Saturday of each year does the
Sydney community without a dissenting voice
allow its maids and matrons to illustrate the pro-
verb. “I hope,” said one pretty girl with a box
between her hands at the Bank of N.S.W., on
Saturday night, “ that if this collection isn’t large
enough there will be two or three.” And she was
evidently quite ready to take to the footpath
again in the sacred cause of charity. But Pope’s
archaic epithet sounds a little too rough for A.D.
1835. Let it be amended by the cynic of Sydney
Hospital Saturday experience—“ Every woman is
at heart a barmaid.”

The main factor in Gov. Hopetoun’s popu-
larity with a rude circle of fashionables was his
rapacity for “ lively ” stories, which he would
swallow like a schoolboy, no matter what their
source. His official success lay in the fact that he
never interfered, questioned, or suggested. His
Ministers were really advisers. In this he was
very unlike Gov. Loch (who, on dit, will succeed
Gov. Duff at Sydney if the gubernatorial salary be
not decreased), and who was always worrying and
“ wanting to know. ” For the same reason Brassey
is not expected to be officially liked. He will have
too much head : will often know more than his
Ministers : and possesses a certain sort of dis-
tinctive character or personality, which boy Hope-
toun completely lacked. The latter, by the way,
was always by Ministers amongst themselves
familiarly referred to as “ the young man.”
Democratically speaking he was not popular at
all, for he was generally supposed to be a skin-
flint. The Countess was a frost until her hunting-
accident, after which her relations with people
about her became much more genial and sym-
pathetic. One of her best stories recounts how
some of the men at the Governor’s first tried
to “mash ” her as she sat, red and nervous, over-
looking them from the balcony.

First prize for newspaper treacle in the
Hopetoun farewell competition has been awarded
to Melb. Herald’s report of the Town Hall
banquet. Mayor Snowde i’s speech, said the
victorious publication, “abounded in the most
felicitous allusions to the earl and countess, while
he avoided that fulsomeness only too common on
such occasions. In the most delicate manner he
touched upon the birth of the young Hopeful
under the Southern Cross.” Magnificent! The
fact of Lady Hopetoun’s latest baby having been
born in—well, Victoria, to tell the truth, was so
delicately mentione 1 that the purest • minded
person present saw no occasion to blush.

Governor and Lady Gormanston (Tas.)
were driving along Liverpool-street, Hobart, a
day or two ago, in their yellow chariot, when the
horses took fright, and one of them, plunging, got
astride the pole of the vehicle. Willing hands
rendered good assistance, and the occupants
alighted. Lady G. walked away from the scene,
while the noble Lord, as the Mercury puts it,
“stood by, and, ’tween whiffs of his cigarette,
gave directions.” (Pouf.) However, when the
harness was re-arranged, his Lordship took his
seat and was about to drive off, when a by stander
who had been most energetic in rendering assist-
ance, reminded him that he had forgotten those
who helped. Two shillings was the response,
Verily, a Governor’s life by his own showing isn’t
worth much. However, the “ strong young
Eublican” who stopped Queen Victoria’s bolting
orses only got .£lO. _
The intrinsic absurdity of vice-regal vani-
ties is fully appreciated when a vice-vice-regal
person is running the show. Cannons roared in
Melbourne, the other day, and the public roared
likewise. Newspaper pars, of this kind explain
the awful waste of ammunition : “ His Excellency
Rear-Admiral Frill paid an official visit to the
Acting-Governor yesterday morning. A salute
of 13 guns was fired from the Domain battery, and
a guard of honor from the Permanent Artillery,
under the command of Captain Fiddledee, re-
ceived the Admiral at the Treasury buildings.
The Acting-Governor will return the call this
morning, embarking at Port Melb. for the Or-
lando.” Granting that official visits are harmless
matters of form, why fire off 13 guns to notify
their occurrence to a public which is utterly unin-
terested in such things ? Surely, it is a mistake to
attract the notice of the populace,to the connec-
tion between Government and Gunpowder. Re-
member Guy Fawkes !

“ The wife of baronet Clarke,” writes a
Bulletin correspondent, “ was one of the first of
the callers at Lady Hopetoun’s last reception, and
one of the first to welcome her on the Spencer-st.
station. She was also the only woman there
whom her frigid ladyship kissed. The little
friction that was known to exist between them
was thus smoothed away at the last. Lady Hope-
toun had a secret admiration for the hostess of
Cliveden, but could not help being jealous of her
social success.”

was Acting-Governor of N.S. Wales in the in-

Chief Justice Madden insists on all the
official etiquette being observed towards him dur-
ing his Vic. Acting-Governorship. Every time
his corpulency goes to the Government Offices the
flag has to be run up on the pole at the top of the
building. Hopetoun never had this stupid farce
carried out. Madden’s aide-de camp, too, a
lieutenant-colonel from ’Ome, is a source of im-
mense amusement in Melbourne, and people are
asking why some smart young Victorian officer
could not have been appointed.

Bishop Sam. Thornton preached in St.
Paul’s Cathedral, Melbourne, on the first Sunday
after Gov. Hopetoun’s departure. His subject
was “Procrastination,” and he remarked how
society was always punctual at dinner, because
otherwise the soup was cold and the vegetables
over-boiled and the hostess upset; but at church
it didn’t matter, and society came late and dis-
turbed people, just because it was fashionable.
All this was hugely relished by the congregation
which had just seen Acting-Gov. Madden and his
family and his uniformed suite majestically stalk
in very late.

The sacred places of Australasia ! There
is a tobacconist’s shop on Lambton Quay, Wel-
lington, Maoriland, that contains, amongst its
elaborate fittings, a dirty old beer-case situate in

Duke of Edinburgh squatted years ago, when he
escaped from the street to have a quiet smoke.
The shop has changed hands now, but the case is
still explained by the present ’bacconist.

upon his life-work. As a patient collector and
collator of dry facts and figures he had no rival
in the opinion of the few people entitled to speak
upon the subject. Sir Charles Dilke, in his
“ Greater Britain,” described Hayter’s statistics
as “ a piece of exquisite mosaic.” A committee
of the House of Commons recorded a more or less
valuable verdict to the same effect, with the
result, seven years afterwards, that our Gracious
Queen presumed to dignify the letters C.M.G.
by hitching them to Henry Hayter’s honored
name. The French and Italian Govern-
ments recognised the unique talent of this
Australian man of figures in a more
fitting manner. By his Victorian Year-Book
the late Mr. Hayter was best known among us,
but during 40 years of enthusiastic toiling he did
many other things, literary and administrative,
to deserve the respect of his lighter-minded
fellows. Moreover, he was an unintentional con-
tributor to the gaiety of these frivolous ones.
Mr. Hayter sometimes sought mental relaxation
in the manufacture of poetry, blank verse for
choice. The present writer has a cheerful recol-
lection of certain lines dashed off for the
visitors’ book at a Fernshaw hotel by the Vic.
Government statist. They were not intended
to be funny, but they were. Hayter, the good
public servant and bad poet, achieved the age of
74 years, despite his disposition to overwork him-
self.

On the Coolgardie road, the other day, a
“swamper” had just finished drinking from a
dam when, to his horror, he saw the body of a man
come gradually to the surface. He hauled the
corpse out, and afterwards discovered that it was
the body of a miner who had developed typhoid
on his way down from the fields, and who, on
going to the dam for a drink, some days pre-
viously, had fallen in and been drowned. The
people on the road had been drinking the water
in the dam for days, whilst it contained the
corpse. Typhoid fever still rages fiercely in every
part of W. A.
Which roundaboutly recalls that nurse Grace,
who went to Paraguay with the first batch of New
Australians, and who, when the disruption
occurred, was among those who clung to the original
leader, Lane, and is now with him and the rest at
the Oolonia Cosme, writes giving a deplorable
account of the condition of the Cosme pioneers :
“We have reached bedrock at last, we have not
a cent left; we cannot afford to buy eggs, even
though they are so cheap; we have no soap
left; we have been without meat for a
month; we have beans for breakfast, beans
for dinner, and beans and stew for tea.
The worst we have to put up with is the want of
water. There is a deep, square drain at the gar-
den gate, and the men have been in the habit of
bathing in it for about three months, and they
have soaked green hides in it. Don’t faint: that
is the water we are drinking ! We cannot even
buy mate, which has become as great a comfort to
the women as tea used to be. D.R. had a sore in
his leg a couple of weeks ago, which caused him
intense pain ; he could not sleep, so he came to me.
There was quite a deep hole in his leg. I out the
opening a little larger, and squeezed four large
grubs out—they had eaten nearly to the bone. I
syringed the place out with Oondy’s fluid twice a
day for some days after, and it got quite well; but
fancy the horror of crawling things breeding in
one’s flesh ! It is bad enough to think that our
bodies must come to that when we die.” Ade-
laide friends have subscribed sufficient to bring
Miss Grace back, but what sort of a pang will it
cause her mates when they know she is returning
to the old home?
The “New Woman” 13

The monkey - element in
human nature is still strong. At
Melbourne, the other day, some
dozens of elderly and presum-
ably intellectual men, attired
in scarlet overcoats and other
garish trappings, seated them-
selves on a platform in the view
of hundreds of spectators, and
for two hours amused themselves
and the onlookers by doing
nothing. Every couple of minutes
a batch of pimply-faced indi-
viduals were ushered on to the
platform and, in defiance of the
most elementary principles of his-
trionic art, stood with their backs
to the audience, while an aged
person in a black-and-gold ulster
threw some inaudible remarks at
them, after which they were led
away to make room for another
batch. For some time past it has
been generally understood that
Commencement Day existed solely
to give the undergrads, an oppor-
tunity of exhibiting the lengths
of idiocy to which the future pro-
fessional men of the province could
go, but in their objoctionally good
behaviour of the week before
last the raison d'etre of this absurd
institution entirely disappears. It
is a pathetic fact that humanity
has not yet got rid of the senti-
ment which caused it to regard
the wisdom of the medicine-man
as commensurate with the num-
ber of feathers in his head, or
altogether lost the respect that
the old Briton felt for the Druid
who was stained the most intense
blue.
The returned Rue Australians keep drop-
ping in, one by one, like the autumn leaves. One
of the last arrivals complains that he sent on £6O
worth of his goods by the Royal Tar, on her first
voyage, and when he and his family arrived, a
little later, the “mates” had helped themselves
to the lot. Another returned pioneer—a woman,
this time—who got back one day last week,
reports that the crops are turning out badly on
the original Rue Australia settlement, and the
final prospect is death by starvation “unlesssome-
thing turns up.” As for the second settlement,
founded by Don Line and his fellow seoeders,
Miss Grace’s letter, above quoted, is eloquent.
Meanwhile, Gilbert Casey has just shipped ten
more emigrants to the land oi the mandolin and
the zephyr and the strange insect that gets into
your feet and has to be dug out with a fork,
which makes 55 more victims within the last three
months ; and he still writes cheerful letters to the
papers pointing out that prospects are brighten-
ing. Almost every hungry wretch who straggles
back from Rue Australia brings up short against
one of Gilbert’s letters, stating that prospects are
brightening.

Spagnolebti: “ Whenever a mawkish false
sympathy mushrooms and gourds up in the com-
munity, a real one seems to grow beside it. Just
when Governor Hopetoun left, Mrs. Da Freitas
died, wife of the restaurateur, of the “Eight
O'Olock Rush,” who gratuitously feeds so many
hungry people every night. It is no exaggeration to
say that such an occurrence was almost the only
one that could cause real grief throughout the
lowest stratum of the Melbourne poor.”

A lady named Andrews lectured the other
day to a large audience at Is. a head in the
Assembly Hall, Melb. The lecturess, a pretty
woman with a fuzzy-wuzzy mop of hair, prattled
artlessly about how girls should be trained, and
told how wicked were stays, how sinful the low
bodice, and how baleful the matric. exam. The
lecture was chiefly remarkable for nothing at all-
in fact, it was quite apropos de bottes but the
chairman, a veteran medico, made a diversion at
the end by calling on ladies in the hall (generally
by their Christian names) to discuss the lecture.
As the ladies had not come prepared to speak,
their remarks were, on the whole, wild and whirl-
ing. One charmer, however, who announced
that “she was not an advanced woman although
she did ride a bicycle,” filled everyone with con-
sternation by saying “ the whole lecture was got up
by a pretty woman simply to please the men.”

Ihe caricature of Oscar Wilde on this
page (reproduced from Lika Joko) gives a very
good idea of the fat young man of 39 whose
“ The Ideal Husband,” will be acted at Sydney
Lyceum theatre on Saturday next. “ The Ideal
Husband ” and a later play, “ The Importance of
Being Earnest,” are still running in Lon-
don, and it is cabled that at each of the
theatres concerned the management —having
regard to the fact that Oscar is now in
gaol charged with nameless immoralities—has
compromised between conscience and pocket by
suppressing the author’s name on the play-bills,
while continuing to pouch the profits of his talent.
The Brough-Boucicault company, which adver-
tised the author in last week’s papers, omits his
name in this week’s advertisement—an imitation
of English procedure which surely might very
well have been spared an Australian community,
especially as Wilde’s guilt is still legally un-
proven.

Reported on the same page of a recent
Melb. Herald are the eases of two men, one of
whom begged ss. from a parson by false repre-
sentations ; the other galloped on his wife and
damaged the policeman who responded to the
cries of “ Murder !” The former got twelve
months’ hard, the latter was fined 20s. or seven
days. Which shows how much less culpable it is
to man-haul a woman and smash a policeman
than to beguile a parson into parting with a crown.
Probably the sentences are commensurate with the
difficulties of the two undertakings.

As Sydney police-court fines for Sunday
trading generally mulct the publican in .£3 and
the “ visitor ” in 15s. each, a basis of common loss
has been laid down and is at present acted on in
several parts of the metropolitan area. This is
that the publicans’ fines and the other fines are to
be added together and divided by the total number
of persons concerned in the breach of the Act,
each being thus bound to an equal monetary risk.

There has reached The

(Vic.) Standard, wherein an
Anglican minister of that dis-
trict is represented as having
said, amongst other things—
“ The national vice of England
is drunkenness, the national
sin of Australia is ineontinence.
. . . . The Australians,
taking (them as a whole, have
the unenviable reputation of
being the most abominable
people in the Queen’s domin-
ions.” In this connection it
is interesting to notice that
the rev. gentleman’s front
name is Joseph.

AN IDEAL HUSBAND
BY OSCAR
WILDE
A very respectable Melb. weekly
has started publishing weekly sermons,
but adopts the plan of trying to extract
money from the godly in return. It
begs for money for a “sermon fund, to
defray cost of printing, &c.” Why
not also a leading-article fund, for the
same reason? Or an agricultural-de-
partment fund ? The position seems to
be : this stuff is “ mush,” but we don’t
mind giving up a little space to it,
prov ided the holy shell out and make it
worth our while.”

Sydney acted for the best in a desperate case. Even if an
accurate diagnosis had been made at an early stage of the

b-\raan characteristic to redeem them from being com-

object to anything. If people own a sacred edifice, and
object to your wearing pants in that edifice, then you
must either remove your pants or stay outside.
A Sydney-sider, now engaged on a Perth

It might be well if new forms of life-
insurance could be protected by patent or copy-
right like other emanations of inventive genius,
mechanical and literary. The general manager of
the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York
has an advertisement in the columns of this issue
claiming the origination of certain life insurance
policies combining the advantages of investment
and trusteeship by the company, which policies
are being copied and placed before the public as
something completely novel by a local office.

IMPORTANT TO PARENTS. RUSSIA
AND ENO’S “ FRUIT SALT.”—An English
Chaplain writes : — 11 Would you kindly inform me
whether you have an agent in Russia for the sale
of your ‘FRUIT SALT?’ If not, would it be
possible to send two or three bottles through the
post? We have used your ‘ FRUIT SALT ’ now
for some time, and think so highly of it that my
wife says she would not be without it for a great
deal. For childrens’ ailments I know of nothing
to equal it. It acts like a charm. Our little ones
have had no other medicine for some time, no
matter what the ailment may be. Cold, headache,
or stomach-ache, the ‘FRUIT SALT’ seems to
cure in a marvellously short time. The ‘FRUIT
SALT ’ seems to be just the medicine we have
required for a long time—something thoroughly
efficacious, which acts quickly and is pleasant to
the taste. lam faithfully yours, A British
Chaplain.” Sold by all Chemists and Stores.
The title of Prof. Morris’s Higinbotham is
“ Memoir of George Higinbotham, an Australian
Politician and Chief Justice of Victoria.” Which
would seem to indicate that the book will be an
apology, written with sole consideration for Eng-
lish readers. The use of “Australian,” when
Higinbotham was essentially and almost exclu-
sively “Victorian,” is obviously intended for
catchpenny purposes. It is no dispraisement of
the great Democrat, but only the literal truth, to
say that he was Victorian. His fine*principles, it
is true, had the universality of right, but his
application of them was necessarily and almost
invariably strictly provincial. The Australian
national sentiment bad hardly been breathed in
the days of his political activity. The word
“ politician ” is also, no doubt, meant for English
ears, as Prof. Morris knows that the term “states-
man ” applied to a radical Australian would be
laughed at by Jingo critics. Yet, if ever there
was a statesman in Australia, George Higin-
botham was one. “ George Higinbotham, Vic-
torian Statesman and Chief Justice,” would
have been a truer title, but “ George Higin-
botham, Democrat,” would have been best of
all. Which, by the way, recalls the experience
of Thb Bulletin man who gave this title to a
book of Higinbothiana which he took to a very
fashionable firm of Smellbourne booksellers in the
forlorn hope that they would accept it for publi-
cation. The head of the firm looked at the title
and said “Why Democrat?” “Because,” was
the reply, “Higinbotham was a Democrat above
all, from first to last.” “I don’t think so,”
snapped the bookseller; “we won’t touch it.” He
rejected it on the title alone, and didn’t condi s-
cend to read a line of the compilation.

At Poverty Point .
Dacre’s bad luck began on the voyage to Australia, and
has stuck to him ever since. He left England with four
hats, and they all blew overboard, so that he had to land
bareheaded.
’Tis said that the five stars of the Gaiety Co.—Harry
Monkhouse, Decima Moore, Fred Kaye, Grace Palolta,
and Maud Hobson—share £2OO b-tween them every week
in salaries. And the greatest of these is Monkhouse, with
something like £6O.
Tis not the question of money, but the time lost in
transit, which operates against Henry’ Irving visiting
Australia. “The Firm” offered him and Ellen Terry
£lO,OOO for a 15 weeks’ season, to bring only themselves
and costumes out, W. and M. undertaking to provide
scenery and supports. The great man appreciated the
liberality of the offer, but said he could not afford to lose
the three months which the voyage out and home would
take.
Prominent members of the Gaiety Co. say “ the Firm’s”
living pictures surpass any they saw in London both in
the matter of posing and lighting. Also, Decima Moore
says the Comic Opera Co.’s rendering of “Cigale” at
Auckland was better than anything of the kind she saw
in ’Murka.
To cart the 30 members of the Gaiety Co. from ’Frisco
to London and backwards and forwards over the Austra-
lian continent will cost “the Firm ” £3OOO. This is the
sort of handicap our managers have to start with before
getting to the profits.
London managers charge for reserved d.c. and stalls,
10s. 6d. ; Melh. Princess’s, ditto, 6s. This, too, for the
same performance of “ The Gaiety Girl ” by the same co.
But “The Firm ” would charge 10s. 6d., too, if it thought
it could get it.
Melba got her first salary of £lO a week, as a warbler
from Williamson and Musgrove. If she sings for “ the
Firm ” in Sept, next she will get £2OO a week. As Abbey,
the ’Murkan manager, is at present giving her that sura
nightly, the Australian engagement doesn’t tempt Nellie
Mitchell much. Melba, however, expresses a strong
desire to show her fellow country-people what sort of
vocal stuff she is made of before her organ gets wheezy.
Oscar Wilde was eager, atone time, to tour Australia,
hut R. S. Smythe thought the sunflower craze bad died
out, and that its apostle would do better by reading his
own comedies. Wilde has a splendid stage appearance.
Sam Keenan, the once well known nigger-minstrel, died,
the other day, in Brisbane hospital. The wandering
mummer always dies in the hospital at last. He has no
other place to die in.
George Buller, formerly of Dampier’s co., an actor o.
much abiliiy and a capable manager, is opening Brisbane
Royal with a company of 30 performers.
The old show-hulk Success has sailed from Adelaide foi
England, with the curse of the old convict epoch for bal-
last, and the ghosts of her former tenants to weigh her
down when she gels into the trough of the sea. The
Success carries a crew of nine stolid seamen who do notj
believe in specties or omens or maledictions. A good
many peopl are of opinion that she will never be heard
of again. Probably she will drop asunder of old age out
in mid-ocean, and go down with her wax figures and her
dungeons and her leg-irons and all the rest.
The children of a recently-arrived panto, and music-
hall favorite are taught to step-dance at the early age of
18 months. This form of exercise developes leg-muscle,
and they soon learn to walk afterwards. Has MTntyre
heard anything of this iie?
The Gaiety people, in Melb., room in three strata—
Menzies, Oriental, Grand.
Why don’t Gaiety troupes have a chaplain? Queens-
herry is missed this time as travelling moralist.
The momentous question which tore the breasts of
Williamson and Musgrove was whether to charge extra for
ilie “Gaiety Girl.” There appears every reason for their
decision in the affirmative, hut yet they nervously remem-
I) red the Italian opera troupe.
Shilling subscription-cards are circulating in Melb. on
behalf of Phil Langdale, the really eminent, bassoonist.
La"gdale has blown his weird, peculiar instrument in
Australia, getting more piaise than cash for Ins trouble,
until the bloom of novelty has left him, and ids means of
getting back to England are nil. If the musical people
of Melt), don’t roll up with the two or three thousand
shillings necessary to land this genial artist at London,
with his family, they are indeed a shahny lot. The
subscription-card idea was chosen in preference to the
usual benefit plan for rai-ing the wind, because Langdale
has tried the latter and found it no good in his case.
Messrs. Allan and Co., Melb., are acting as treasurers for
the unassuming fund, and anyone who hasn’t been intro-
duced to a subscription-card may get one by applying at
the music-shop.
Another promising musical Australienne is Miss Elvira
Lee, contrallo (of Vicloria, of course), who has just gained
the Loudon Victoria College of Music diploma as Asso-
ciate, displacing a score of aspirants. She is now study-
ing for oratorio. She is said to have a very fine voice,
and to be possessed of much feeling.
The cake goes to Mr. Monkhouse, of the New Gaiety
Co. At Chicago, he saw “ two men killed through a
jeweller’s window being blown out in that blizzard, and
right in front of our hotel the storm whipped a man out
of his dray, lifted him away like a piece of tissue-paper,
and flung him against a wall—dead, poor fellow.”
One Melh. juvenile acting-troupe advertises: “Carriages
at 10.30.” The other one (the rival Cohens) says:

Gaiety-girl Maud Hobson was born at St. Kilda, and

handsome girl, who lived for some years in the Sandwich
Islands with her husband. Captain Hayley, who was
chamberlain to King Kalakaua, while she was one of the
Queen's ladies-in-waiting. A little while ago she made
some stir in Lon'don by sharply rapping Labouohfcre over
the knuckles about some Truth paragraphs re the pre-
sents of jewellery sent to Gaiety girls. Maud says those
presents are fiction, and that Gaiety girls get precious few
of them. Furthermore, she somewhat vaguely says that
Gaiety girls “ are, as a rule, as good as any other girls.”
“The Firm” has included Longstaff’s "Breaking the

Some girls of “ The Gaiety Girl ” report that they were
so sought after by New’ York dudes and anglo-maniacs in
America that the police used to have to carve with their
clubs a path for them through the mashers who congre-
gated about the stage-doors. The Bulletin fears that
the dear crea'ures will miss these little attentions in Mel-

The squabbling and “rowing” between lessee and actor
during rehearsals at a Southern theatre, is said to be
most embarrassing for all taking part in the piece. Last
week, an unfortunate scene-shifter was kept some ten

He served for some years as an officer of the Cape Mounted
Rifles, end then took to the si age, and, among other
things, stage-managed the first production of “The
Gaiety Girl.” “ Bat ’’ Malone is a great athlete. He was
considered the best footballer in Edinburgh Univer-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The V.R.C. has passed a resolution in favor of
the totalisator. Meantime, the general public of
Victoria have mostly resolved to let the little
gang of “clever,” hard-up horse-owners have their
game all to themselves. “No more races for me,”
is the common cry among people who can still
afford to throw away a few pounds in speculation, but are
tired of pouring their gold down the turf sink of
iniquity. The tote, as a remedy for the V.K.C.’a com-
plaint (which is a rapid decline of gate-receipts) will pro-
bably not be applied until the case is quite hopeless.
Racing was a national sport in Victoria as long as its chief
supporters were men of honor, as turfy honor goes.
Nowadays, w'hen there are no chief supporters worth
mentioning, and the “ little men ” are almost invariably
duffers, racing isn’t a sport, any more. The tote only appeals
to outsiders who are disposed to bet. After they have aban-
doned that disposition in disgust a betting-machine has
no interest for them. “No races for me, no tote for me ;
no anything, except my money safe in my trousers’
pocket” is the creed of the converted punter. And the
converted punter, as a matter of fact, is a much stronger
influence in society than the teetotaller who has never
taken a drink.

Totalisator argument. There are, at a very
modest computation, 400 bookmakers plying their calling
in N.S. Wales. If the income of each is taken at £3OO, it
will be found that these parasites of the turf cost the race-
going public and the horseovvners £120,000 a year. This is
the tax they levy annually on the sport. Now", by means of
the totalisator, the racing clubs would be their own book-
makers and this £120,000 would go to increase the slakes,
and so the owners could afford to race their horses profit-
ably without betting a ceiit. If the totalisatoris legalised
The Bulletin will insist on the deduction of 10 or 12 or
even 25 per cent, of the profits for chanty. In fact, much
can be said in favor of 40 per cent.

Dear Bulletin, —“A par. in your last issue re
Trenton says ‘How time flies! It seems but yesterday
that lie ran second and third for two Melb. Cups—beaten
both times by weight.’ The man who wrote that has a
bad memory for events which seem to him but as tilings
of yesterday. Trenton ran third and second in successive
Melbourne Cups, and it wasn't weight that beat him on
either occasion. Bad riding lost Trenton the race that
Sheet Anchor annexed. He carried 7st. 121 b. only, and
should have won easily, but the late Alec. Robertson
waited with the Musket horse, as though he were a Malua,
instead of bringing him to the front and trusting to his
staying powers. Next year it was lack of condition which
caused Trenton to get beaten by Arsenal. He had to be
eased in his work, on account of a leg, some days before
the Melbourne Cup, and ajthough they got the leg fairly
right again, Trenton was not fit enough to win on fair
handicap terms. The weight (9st. 91b.) didn’t stop him.
He carried too much flesh, and the sweat dropped off him
like rain after the race. I saw Trenton return to the
paddock greatly disiressed, and remember that his
trainer asked the mob to “ stand hack and let the horse
have a little air.”—Yours, Trbntonian.

Lockwood, of course, was the one disastrous
failure of Sioddart’s eleven. They brought the Surrey
man out here as a first-class bowler, and he gave them 18
wickets in 11 a-side matches for an average of 46 runs per
wicket. Lockwood never “ came off ” but once—in the
match with N.S. VV. That solitary performance served to
show what a help he might have been to the team, who,
with him persistently out of form, and Humphreys laid
aside as useless, had to trust to three good bowlers. An
extraordinary feature of Lockwood’s performance, under
the circumstances, was the feeble steadiness with which
he batted. He came out with an average of 18i runs,
although his best score was only 39.
• ♦ ♦ •
N.S.W. and Vic. were not sorry to see the
Englishmen revenge themselves upon George Qiffen and
co. after all the S. A. skiteas to the absurdity of “weaken-
ing ” Australian Elevens by the inclusion of men fiom
other provinces. GiSen and 00. were the only true
representatives of the country's cricket, according to
every Adelaide inhabitant. In fact, they felt quite capable
of producing a second eleven good enough to smash the
visitors. That 609 innings, made without Stoddart’s
assistance, was the result of Adelaide bombast, in a great
measure. The Englishmen told their Melbourne friends
before leaving to back them for the match against S. A.,,
because they meant playing it for all they were worth.
The fear of George Gif. had died out of their hearts.
Brown, in the last test-match, showed them the mistake
of over-estimating the “champion’s” bowling resources,
and they promised to give Georgey beans. The promise
was fulfilled. Nevertheless, the Englishmen couldn’t get
rid of the South Australians easily. They scored 609 runs
in eight hours, but the game was not won before three
minutes to six o’clock on the fifth day. S.A. scored 650
runs in about 15 hours.
• • * *
The English score of 609 was very pleasing to
Stoddart, as it removed the pangs accompanying that 586
made by Australia in Sydney, and Ward’s 218 also put
Gregory’s 201, hi the same match, in the shade.
♦ » • »
Stoddart said in Adelaide that he would bring
another team out if he were asked, and Major Wardill
promptly invited him to do so. The M.C.C. and Sydney
Ground Trustees decided on this awhile ago. The team
will come out in ’97.
* * • •
Little Brown was one of the careful pros, of the
English team. He didn’t draw a penny of his money in
advance, and the fee (£3OO odd) will be banked to his
credit in one loomp when he gets back to Yorkshire.
Some of the others must be wishing now that they had
followed the young-’un’s example. Especially the cham-
pion grogsterof the crowd, who had so many fines for “un-
fitness to play ” entered against his name that he finished
up, it is said, with a debit balance.

Ford came with a very late rush in the English-
men's race for best batting average. His last, two
innings proluced 194 runs, out of a total of 508 for 20-
innings.
• * • *
In eleven-a-side matches against the English-
men 25 Australian batsmen made a better average than
either Lockwood, Briggs, Phillipson, or Richardson. Also
11 of those 25 made a higher individual score than was
achieved by seven members of Stoddart’s team (including
Gay and Humphreys). Six Australians made “three-
figure” scores, and five Englishmen did likewise. The
tadpole character of the Englishmen’s hatting is very
noticeable. The first four men—Stoddart, M'Laren,
Brown, and Ward—made an average aggregate of 182
runs per innings between them, whereas the other nine,
including Gay and Humphreys, who seldom played, were
worth only 172 runs on paper.

Maclaren, Ford, and Gay didn’t go ’Ome with
the English cricketers, but came back to the Smellful
city imm diately after the Adelaide match. Toorak is an
attractive suburb for the English amateur.

The English pros, gave Stoddart a handsome
silver tobacco-jar before leaving for England “as a tribute
of their respect for a great cricketer and a gentleman.”
The pros, didn’t do this for Grace.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
Stoddart h°ads the batting for first-class
matches with 870 runs for 18 innings; average, 51-17.
George Giffen second, 902 runs for 20 innings ; average,
50-11. Clem Hill, 47'85, and M'Laren, 47’23, come next.
M'Kibhin heads the howling averages, 16'79 runs per
wicket; Harry Trott second, 19’CS. George Giffen is
eighth with 22'53, and Tom Richardson ninth with 23’83.
All the same, the last two were the best bowlers in the big
matches.

A very big man and a very little man, strangers
to each other, were studying the last cricket telegram
from Adelaide on Saturday night in Melbourne. The wire
read: “England, 4 for 451,” and the little mm ejaculated,
“By Jove, good business! Splendid!” “What the Hades
do yon call good business? You’re talking vermilion rot,
you are,” howled the large fellow, moving close up to the
other and glaring down on him. "Well, it’s only right
to let them have the last game before they sail, seeing
that they lost the majority of (he test-matches,” said the
small person slowly and in tones of clear-cut precision.
“Perhaps you’re right.” replied the big man, and he
moved away along the street. When he had gone a few
yards it dawned on him that lie d been had, and with
very soft bait. With a mighty curse he swooped round
to jump on the little man’s diaphragm, tint the little man
hadn’t waited. He was sprinting for his life 75 vards off.
• ♦ * ♦
George Giffen was 34 on March 27, and Clem.
Hill was 18 on March 29. The latter celebrated his birth-
day by making 150, not out, against the Englishmen in
Adelaide. His father, one of the S.A. Railway Commis-
sioners, gave him £1 a run above the century, so that it
must have been galling to him to see his last companion’s
wicket fall.

Brockwell has been a failure in batting, bowling,
fielding, and lastly, and mostly, in writing. With Ids
thorough knowledge of English and Australian cricket;
with his long experience as a cricketer himself ; with his
unique opportunities for observation on the Australian
tour; with the privilege of profiting by the views and
ideas of his brother Englishmen upon the campaign ;
with all this to make his task easy and complete he should
have been able to collect the notes for constructing an
unequalled narrative. But his last article in the Review

and wishy-washy, and suffers by comparison with the

Last Saturday, at the Sydney Oricket-Gronnd,
was a great day for Megson, the N.S. W. champion cyclist,
and for the woman who, burning to draw men’s eyes upon
herself, threw herself forward under the propitiatory
shield of Charity and besieged the men upon lawn and
stand, and pouted and ogled and giggled.
The League Cup Final, first prize .£2O, was a
hollow affair, won with yards in hand from Meadham by
Cathie, of Victoria.
The Metropolitan Handicap, first prize, .£100;
second, £l5 ; third, £5; brought surprises. Megson won
the first heat so brilliantly that the crowd thought him a
dead bird for the final, especially because, after his
splendid riding, he returned to his dressing-room showing
not the least symptoms of distress. In the fourth heat
Chapman, of Grafton, N.S. W., managed to tie Morton, of
Victoria, for fourth place, thus just squeezing himself
into the final. And in the final Chapman sprinted away,
at the finish, from the field and the doughty Megson, and
won by ten yards from Cusack. Freeman, an old Sydney
rowing-man, was third. Megson should remember that
it is a wise cyclist who rides his race in the final.
The race on which public enthusiasm spent
itself was the Five-Mile Championship of Australasia.
Among others, Megson and Lewis represented N.S.VV. ;
Middleton, Victoria ; Boyd, Maoriiand. Neil Matterson,
who had won the Three-Mile Handicap from Chris. Neil-
sen, also competed, hut the pace made by tandems was
too hot for any but the cracks—and the ninth lap saw all
but Lewis, Middleton, Boyd, Megson and Everett out of
it. Lewis rode splendidly, being nearly the whole time
first, just behind the tandem. In the eleventh lap,
Middleton was tiring, beginning to drop behind ; in the
twelfth lap he fell, and claimed a foul against Boyd, but
the protest was not allowed. At the last lap the tandem
drew off, and then ensued one of the gamest struggles
that cyclists ever saw. Everitt sprinted for a moment,
and then died back fourth ; and the honor of first place was
most desperately contested by Megson and Lewis. Fifty
yards from home Megson got his wheel in front and
finally won by a yard. Only Megson’s strong jaw won
the race.

It would be like picking up money to back the
Red Legs (Melh. Football Club) for this season’s Premier-
ship. Good players are standing off their old clubs
waiting for an offer. It has oome to this—“ The highest

of to-day must live, and there is only one club now strong
enough to keep him.

At the recent meeting of Essendon Football
Club the secretary said he was sorry the charity football
match at the end of last season was a dead failure, and
that his club would like to see a percentage of gate-money
given to the charit}’. Charity with Vic. football clubs
begins and stays at home. Last season Geelong offered
to play the Premiers a return match (worth about £3OO
gate) on one condition only— charity. The answer was

The fight, a few weeks back, between “Star-
light" and Harry Duggan, at Nathan's, seems to have
been marred by an exhibition of race prejudice. The
colored man complained loudly of unfair treatment from
spectators, officials, and opponent. So rancorous did the
contest become that the police had to interfere in the
middle of the 6th round and stop it. If the police also
interfered when small boys are put up to punish one
another for the edification of full-grown men it would he

“Is it possible for the tote to swindle?” writes a
Bulletin correspondent from Maoriland, “ Well, if any-

meetings, he would sometimes observe the party in charge
of the receiving front, who generally stands high above
the heads of the crowd, flop a pound on the horse that
gets a flying start in an eight furlong race ; and nine
times out of 10 the flying starter in sprints gets 1 home.’
Also, as the start-bell seldom rings until the bunch are
30yds. under way, and the crowd cannot see as well as
the ‘receiving front,’ this party for one has an advan-

his own well-nourish d figure. The club being for the
most part short-winded, the medical staff prescribed
mild exertion to begin with. Also, Fink and Best advise
the club not to venture far into the country lest
its legs might stray upon syndicated soil and
get prosecut- d for trespass. Consequently the agile
Wallabies devote themselves chiefly to trips down
the Bay, where they can pace the vessel s deck with
measured beat and slow, and cultivate a furious appetite
for “ fish tea.” Another favorite pedestrian tour is
purely urban. The secretary summons his bounding
brethren to meet at the top of Bomke-street at 7.45 p.m.,
with a view to striding along to one of • the theatres.
After an hour’s rest in the dress-circle, they indulge in
another “pipe-opener” as far as the refreshment-bar,
and a gentle walk to their respective homes concludes the
healthful outing. A recent resolution in favor of the
club taking a tram on these occasions was defeated by a
large and scornful majority. Tne Wallabies have lost, on
an average, nine ouncts of flesh.

These remedies have cured where operation and

Slipshod Sydney Telegraph is beautifully
taken-down by R. E. O'Connor over the Flogging
Bill which that Spartan has introduced to the
Leg-iron Council’s notice. Two years ago the
Telegraph thought (in discussing exactly the
same Bill) that Mr. O’Connor “deserved the
thanks of the community for drawing it up.”
The other day it denounced it (re-introduced) as
“a piece of frenzied silliness,” Now O’Connor
impales his victim on its own hooks, and cheer-
fully “awaits its explanation ” while he watches
it writhing. It’s a bad thing not to have a settled
policy.
There is a lot of justice in the complaint
of competitors with Hordern Bros., the well"
known Pitt-street (Sydney) drapers, that they are
taking an unfair advantage of trade rivals. “ You
not only undersell us,” say these latter in effect;
“you not only provide a better article at a lower
price than we provide; you not only secure the
latest fashions and the choicest fabrics before we
can get them ; but you must further attract people
with dog-shows and exhibitions of typical stock-
men, and so on. Tain’t fair.” And off they go
sulking.
An enthusiastic advt. in another part of
this paper calls on the public to “use Aunt Mary’s
baking-powder.” The present writer doesn’t
know of any reason why the public shouldn’t use
Aunt Mary’s baking-powder, and, so far as he is
aware, from the want of any knowledge to the
contrary, it is the exact thing which people should
use. In former days, when he was a lonely pros-
pector in a tent and baked his own damper, he
tried many varieties of baking-powder, and failed
with them all; but, as he didn’t try Aunt Mary’s,
it is quite probable that it is the only sample that
he wouldn’t have failed with. Anyhow, the
public tries so many things with more or less
success that it might as well try Aunt Mary’s
baking-powder along with the rest.
“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia ; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland, where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe ” or
“ B illyhooley.” It is just the thing lor an aspir
ing oomique, pro. or amateur.’'

REPORT and BALANCE-SHEET.
To be presented at the Twenty-fourth Annual Meeting of the Members, to be held at the Society
Offices, 406 Collins-street, Melbourne, on Friday, the 29th March, 1895, at 4 o’clock p.m.
The directors have the pleasure to present to the members their annual report, with revenue
account and balance-sheet, for the year ending 31st December, 1894.
During that period there were received —
1921 proposals to assure .£399,220
of which 569 are in course of completion, or were withdrawn, or declined, for £122,200
and proposals were reduced to the extent of ... 4250
126,450
leaving 1352 proposals accepted and completed for £272,770
add 60 proposals received in 1893, for which policies were issued in 1894 11,450
Total 1412 policies issued in 1894, assuring £284,220
yielding an annual revenue of £9,233 18s.
120 claims occurred during the year under 125 policies, to the amount of £32,650, which is con-
siderably less than the amount expected under the mortality table in use for valuation purposes.
The claims have decreased year by year since 1890, when they amounted to £45,371 11s. lid.
The total income for the year was £159,391 3s. 7d.
The sum of £43,526 Bs. sd. was added to the funds, which amounted at the close of the year to
£902,158 12s.
Ttie interest earned for the year was more than sufficient to pay all claims and bonuses.
The two directors who retire at this meeting, in terms of the articles of association, are Mr.
U illiam Siddeley and Mr. William Riggall. Mr. Siddeley is eligible for re-election, and has given
notice of his intention to offer himself accordingly. Mr. Riggall, through press of private business,
finds himself unable to devote sufficient time to the duties of his office, and therefore does not offer
himself for re-election. The directors, with a view to a further reduction of expenditure, will propose
to the members to reduce the number of directors to five, and the remuneration to £750 per annum.
The auditors, Messrs. A. W. Cleveland and C. M. Holmes, also retire in terms of the articles of
association, and have given notice of their intention to offer themselves for re-election.

We have examined the books, accounts and securities of the Mutual Assurance Society of Vic-
toria, Limited, at Melbourne (the statement of accounts from the branches, duly certified by the local
auditors, have been correctly incorporated in the head-office books), and certify that, in our opinion,
the above balance-sheet is a full and fair balance-sheet, containing the particulars required by the
regulations of the society, and exhibits a true and correct view of the affairs of the society on the 31st
December, 1894.

Fac-siraile of Cheque for £2500, received for part of Victorian
rights in No. 1 Patent Inveslm nt-First Dividend on Original
Subscription of £5OO.
Profits on Patents. —“ More money has been, and always can be, made out of patented in-
ventions than by any other investments.”
Essentials to Success with Patents.— (l.) A good and novel invention. (2.) Capital to
protect and develop the invention THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. (3.) Experience in appraising
the intrinsic merits of an invention, its prospects of success, and, after securing protection, in deve-
loping and introducing it on the world’s markets—in short, Business Management.
Good inventions on the one hand, capital on the other, are comparatively plentiful. THE AUS-
TRALIAN PATENTS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY is projected to provide the third equally
important essential, business management.
The success attending the privately conducted PATENT INVESTMENTS Nos. 1 and 2, and
the numerous flattering applications from inventors and investors alike, convince the management
that there is room for the extension of its operations over a much wider field than was at first contem-
plated.
The Company’s modus operandi is as follows: Selecting the first essential, viz., “a good and
novel invention,” from amongst the many offered for approval, the Company invites subscriptions
to a development fund —in this case of .£lOOO in 1000 shares of .£1 each. This provides the second
essential, “ Capital to develop and protect the invention.”
The business relations established throughout the world in dealing with their other valuable-
patents, and the experience of the Company’s officers and experts afford the third essential, “ Business
Management.”
The Management can confidently recommend their No. 3 Investment to subscribers as a thoroughly
safe speculation, and one certain to bring m very handsome returns. It is anticipated that the sales
of patent rights and licenses to manufacture the invention selected (which is an article of everyday use
in every household) will produce a nett return of from one to three million pounds sterling, and that
it will commence to pay handsomely immediately the patents are fully secured, giving a dividend
exceeding the original subscription within six months.
The invention is perfected, and patents are being secured in every part of the world. The funds
subscribed are used exclusively for this purpose. No part of the fund goes to inventor until nett
profits are declared, of which he takes one-third.
No. 3 Investment Closes with
1000 SUBSCRIBERS
At Each.
Subscriptions registered in order of receipt.
Subscription Certificates for each £ subscribed,
numbered (from 1 to 1000) in same order as
registered, forwarded by return post.
Subscriptions received in excess of .£lOOO on
No. 3 will be registered on No. 4, the terms of
which will be similar to No. 3, or such subsequent
investment on similar terms as they may be in
time for, unless otherwise directed by subscriber.
One-third of nett profits on Sales of Patent
Rights and Licenses to manufacture on Royalty
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, are divided
amongst subscribers at intervals not exceeding
Six Months.

solitary individual was waiting for J. Butt on the
wharf. He was a life-insurance agent, and he
stepped on board and buttonholed the over-
whelming potentate, and pointed out so persua-
sively the advantages of insuring under his
society’s endowment table, payable at age 50, that
Joseph B. is said to have signed the proposal on
the spot. Probably a feeling of loneliness had
come over him, and even a life-insurance can-
vasser felt like company.

DIRECTORS.
The Directors who retire at this meeting are the Hon. J. F. Levien, M.L.A., and the Hon. Agar Wynne, M.L.C., who, being eligible, offer themselves
for re-election. Messrs. George Withers and H. Byron Moore also retired during the year. Mr. Withers has been re-elected on his return to the colony.
Mr. Samuel Butcher, of the Natal Directorate, resigned his seat owing to ill-health, and the Hon. A. M. Campbell, of Durban, has been elected in

AUDITORS.
Mr. Louis Charles Wilkinson and Mr. B. D. Smith retire at this meeting, and offer themselves for re-election.
QUINQUENNIAL INVESTIGATION.
The preliminary work in connection with the Quinquennial investigation is now in progress. Owing to the large number of policies on the society’s
books, the work of valuation will necessarily take some months. The results will be announced during the year at a special general meeting, of which due
notice will be given.

rn ALES OF THE SYSTEM
gdf
“ All men are of one blood, when the fight
is that all men may be free.”—Saxk Holm.
Melbournian: “I find a poor woman
chopping wood, which her husband is to cart out
to-morrow.”
Messrs. Crawford and Co., having pur-
chased the stock of the late Melbourne firm of
Crawford, King and Co., have now re-opened the
popular warehouse on a better scale than ever.
Th ■ new firm will elaborate the liberal principles
of the old one, adhering to the fixed precept of the
best article at the lowest possible price.
Much speculation has been indulged in
from time to time as to why the young Australian
should be prematurely bald. Go into a theatre
and it will be seen at a glance that, say, half of
the males have shed their hair, while the females
doubtless resort to artificial substitutes to conceal
their similar defects. The cause of the anomaly
has not been ascertained so far, but, singular to
relate, Mr. P. Chamboissier, hair specialist, of 300
Collins-st., Melb., has discovered a remedy. His
wonderful restorative, Philotrix, is said to secure
marvellous results in the prevention and cure of
baldness, and'he has received valuable testimonials
to its worth from leading society people in Melb.
His striking window decoration —a living woman
with a peerless head of chestnut-colored hair —is a
leading attraction of the Collins-st. block on fine
afternoons.*

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than
any I have hitherto used, besides being free from
the heavy nauseous odour characteristic of others.
“This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
“ It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-

The “ Introduction ” to Francis Kenna’s recently-
published book of verses ;
Within my breast, encaged, I held you long,
Wild, white song birds !
I heard you sing, and strove to write your song
In these poor words.
I heard you beat your wounded breasts all night
Against the bars,
For you were of the things that loved the light,
The sky, the stars.
You were a part of me, and of the air,
The sun, the sea,
Shy, wild, white things, whose songs, so full of care,
Were dear to me.
Now where the sea’s e ternal waste expand
I stand, and lo!
I take you one by one within my hand
And let you go.

The colonel, a major, a captain, and the
sergeant-major of the Scots Greys, were lately
despatched to St. Petersburg for the idiotic pur-
pose of recognising the Czar as Colonel-in-chief of
their regiment—a courtesy-appointment made by
Our Gracious Queen. The four pilgrims, having
paid homage to their chief, came back to London,
and drew expenses on a sliding-scale.

A Bulletin correspondent : —Everyone
who has spent much time among the Maoris must
have been impressed by their extraordinary musical
capacity. It is no exaggeration to say that even in
Europe, the home and birthplace of modern music,
there is no race of people who, taken as a body,
have so keen an appreciation of the fundamental
principle of “ time." Give a Maori a concertina
or acoordeon and he will play you a waltz which,
for all purposes of the dance, shall be perfect.
Almost entirely without tutors they have taught
themselves to sing not only the air of a song,
but to vary it and give the different parts
with a precision which the average English child
only attains after long practice. Yet one
would imagine that between the primitive tom-
tom and the simplest melody sung in parts
lies a gulf greater than could be bridged
in the lifetime of a savage. During the
last year or so, a further advance has
been made into the realm of instrumental
music, and it is now becoming a common thing for
the traveller in some remote village to come upon
a Maori practising on a trombone, or to be sud-
denly startled by the sound of a native brass
band in full blast. In Northern Wairoa, a couple
of years back, the Maoris managed to convert a
ton or so of gum into a brazen orchestra. Their
enthusiasm was great. For months they met two
or three times a week to practise, and they one
and all ended by mastering their instruments.
Crops were almost neglected, gum-digging at a
stand-still ; the band took precedence of every-
thing. About Christmas time they marched into
Helensville, gaunt and almost in rags. They
took up their stand before the hotel, the con-
ductor, his face shining with perspiration and a
premonition of glory, waved his baton, and the
disreputable-looking band burst into a perform-
ance which fairly ‘‘astonished the natives."

Blake’s Steam Pumps are the Best.
There are more Blake Pumps in use than there are of any other make, anri they have been adopted
by the largest Steam Engine and Steamship Builders in all countries, as well as by the Naval Depart-
ments of the English, United States and Russian Governments. The Blake Pump is in operation in
many town and city waterworks, iron, coal, silver and gold mines, and on the extensive pipes lines of
the oil regions of America and Russia. We claim “ the Blake Pump as the Standard Steam Pump,”
It having been fully recognised as such, as our extensive
and increasing sales testify. It has been pronounced by
mechanical experts and engineers to be the Best Steam
Pump, for the following reasons, viz.:
It is simple in construction !
It is positive under any pressure !
It is operated by the common I» slide valve I
It is durable and well arranged in all its parts I
It is made from improved designs and new patterns 1
It is made of the best matbfials, in the most workman-
like manner !
It is arranged with large valve areas, free water pas-
sages and large ports 1
It will start at any point of stroke, and discharge the
water of condensation 1
It will not break down when suddenly started, as in the
case of an alarm of fire, etc. !
It will run at any speed—slower or faster than any
other steam pump of same dimensions 1
It will pump all kinds of liquids, hot or cold, thick or
thin, clear or gritty, and varying in specific gravity
from alcohol to white lead !
It is economical in its operation, requiring less steam
for a given amount of work than any other steam
pump to be found in the market 1
It is interchangeable in all its working paits, so that in case of wear or accidental breakage, duplicate parts can be
immediately supplied!
It will work without shock or vibration, and can be operated with water or air pressure as well as steam, an
important feature in case of being submerged or “drowned out,” as is often the case in mines, etc.
Every Pump is thoroughly tested before shipment, and fully warranted by us.

The Vic. Income-Tax Office, now practically on
its trial, is much handicapped by the composition of its
staff, which, to a deplorable extent, includes the dead-
beats of all the other State departments. Any Govern-
i“ en « r * s generally tenaciously clungf to by
the official head of his branch, but the staff of Victoria’s
(at present) most important department are mostly those
who have been let go from other branches of the service
without a murmur.
* * * *
Victorian income-tax clerks occupy most of
their spare time in catechising each other on the techni-
calities of the Act. Tile Civil Service generally has an
idea that the tax has come to stay, which is evinced bv
the numerous applications for transfers to the taxing-
branch. And civil servants are not bad judges, either.
VV hen the State Labor Bureau was created in Melbourne a
few \. ais ago no one could be found anxious to fill the
positions, and —the Labor Bureau is now non est .
* * * *
The Vic. Income-Tax is drawing attention to
the wide and comprehensive ignorance that most people
soft r with regard to th ir ov\n business. Suburban
storekeepers who have never “taken stock” in their
lives, who have never recorded how much of the till-
money and how much of the stock is taken for house-
keeping, and who have not. the faintest idea of the
amount of their annual turn over, naturally stare aghast
at the income-tax schedules. The business habits that
the tax will encourage will, perhaps, not be the least of
its merits.
* • * «
A Melb. merchant who lately advertised for a
youth to assist in the store, and received 60 written
applications in reply, draws the conclusion that State
S ;lio >1 education in Victoria is not giving great results
inus far. Only one letter in every 10 was well put
t 'getber, and straight to the point.; most of them being
rambling yarns of t,ae Sam Weller class. “Inow take the
pleasure of writing you thease few lines applying for the
billet in witch you are advertising for, My age is 18 - this
Month,” An extract from a letter taken at random out
of a heap. Another applicant set forth his virtues in a
postscript, and the last two items on the list were “ In-
dustrious. Total Siibstainer.” The Slate ought to get
something better than that for its education-money.

The world is cruel.—Branch bank manager;
brnk reconstructed ; lost, his post ; went into business-it
didn’t pay ; now canvasser ; called on some of the bank's
customers, who said, “won’t give orders, have not the
cash” ; a parody on a profession.il-routine saying of the
ex-manager, “ You should not, enter into engagements
without having the money.” Poor devil!
♦ • ♦ *
In N.S. W. the other day, the defence set up by
a certain aggressive and speculative solicitor was charac-
terised as “impossible” by the bench. “Impossible
there is nothing impossible!” barked the attorney.
“ Except a land-boomer paying 20s. in the £,” remarked
a usually silent beak.
• * * •
One of the most paying of the humbler occupa-
tions in Melbourne has been the rag, bone and bottle
business, up to n >w almost monopolised by one or two
men who, beginni ig with very small capital, have made
little piles. The big dealer lets out hand carts for collect-
ing bottles, etc., to anyone for fid. a day, with a proviso
that all goods Collected must be disposed of at his yard in
the evening. Tne price fixed for dirty bottles is 3s. fid.
the gross. Tnese are cleaned at a nominal cost at the
yard and re-s fid at 11s. to 125., leaving a profit after
cleaning, etc., of about ss. per gross. As a man with a
hand-cart will sometimes bring in three gross per day, the
profits are considerable.
• * • •
Judging from many recent events, it would be
better to abolish the Law Institute (which is composed of
trades-union lawyers) and have a Govt, officer appointed
to investigate complaints against legal practitioners, and
where actual embezzlement occurs report to the Crown-
Solicitor, who should be compelled to prosecute as though
it were only a private wroug. The widespread dishonesty
of the profession is a public calamity, and prevents many
from even seeking justice.
♦ ♦ * *
The Tas. police are wrestling with a counterfeit-
shilling case. The new counterfeiter is not content with
the brummagem goods that “ passed " in the olden time.
He now guarantees workmanship and quality of goods.
The new counterfeit is so true to pattern that an expert
hesitates long before passing judgment. In fact, it is
very doubtful whether the sham shilling would carry con-
viction before an ordinary jury unless the coining plant,
or other corroborative evidence of the coin’s illegitimacy,
were produced. The birth-place of the sham, as in a
former Vic. case, was probably China, where the Japanese
aie. Tiie coin' is true to weight, color, assay' and
general appearance. It is not perfect in detail, however,
arid a strong magnifying glass and patient study reveal
the discrepancies. Hut it is only a question of lime, and
the British authorities will not be the only' ones to draw a
profit from Australia’s silver currency.
* * * •
Victorian ex-Solicitor-General Wynne’s great
scheme for borrowing money to pay off all the Vic. pen-
sioners, by giving each the value of his pension in a lump
sum, and then leaving posterity to liquidate the loan by
instalments, has been coldly received. Premier Turner
very reasonably points out that the pensioner who has
some fatal disease on him and has one leg already in the
grave would doubtless take the lump sum and make a
good thing out of it, and the one who feels good for many
years to come would insist on keeping his annuity,
\V hich is just what would happen. The suffering country
always gets taken in like that.
* * ♦ *
One of the disadvantages of a journal being
under the thumb of a board of directors is exemplified at
a Southern evening newspaper office. Directors, thinking
that their connection with “the press” makes them
privileged, ring up on the telephone for tickets for race-
meetings, cricket-matches, and other functions. It is an
impudent demand which people responsible for such
affairs ought to have the courage to snub. Mere guinea-
pigs who happen to speculate in newspaper shares ought
to get no more privileges than mining or any other
directors. One of the good features about David Syrae is
that he never takes a “complimentary’' ticket.
* * ♦ *
The exposure of certain gold-buyers found using
false weights is another blow to the trustful public. In
some instances the weights were 10 per cent, heavy, and
the unfortunate vendors have, therefore, been losing
2dwt. for .every ounce sold to the smarties. The
roan who buys old jewellery, however, has to keep
his eyes open very wide. The ordinary acid-tests on the
touchstone are fur from being sufficient with certain
grades, and there is this peculiarity about hall-marks,
that they don t pan out all right to the man who melts.
The jewellery marked 15-carat generally confesses itself
a carat short when put to the indisputable test of the
crucible. Bayers of old gold have a so the question of
alloys to face. Manufacturers who care for their reputa-
tion generally require tested gold to work from. They
would decidedly object to a parcel found to contain iron,
for instance. The Mint will take old jewellery ; but when
the pawnbrokers’ parcels of wedding-rings, false-tooth
plates, and other characteristic odds and ends arrive for
melting, “fine gold” is the basis of purchase, and the
depositor suffers on an equitable soalefor every ounce of
base metal in the parcel. The old-gold dealer has, there-
fore, to take his chances when he buys without assay;
and assay of every small article is practically impossible.
He has a right to charge a margin for risk ; but he must
be made to put it in his prices, not in his weights.

From Hinglmd. Two butchers in a small
country town have shops opposite one to the other. One
sold home products—Welsh mutton, best Scotch, &0.,
while the other sold only Australian meat. On Satur-
days, in particular, business rivalry ran high, and the
contending butchers nearly came to blows. The public
took sides, and, English patriotism supporting English
meat, Australian wares began to wane in popularity. It
turned out in the end that one man owned both shops
and sold Australian meat in both—in the one, however,
at English prices. The population is still cursing.

Editor Bulletin, — This is an accursed country
—the worst outside Gehenna. It is the birthplace of beau,
tiful mirages, of deadly insects, and lovely-hued reptiles ■
of songless birds, of venomous flies, of undrinkable water,
immersion in which peels the skin from the hardest
hand ; and of thj most virulent “ Barcoo rot” in any
part of the Australias. But it is a land fairly teeming
with gold, and one that will vie with any known area in
gold production. The more I see of the country the more
am I satisfied that it is too huge to be coped with in a
decade. Picture an auriferous area of over 200,000 square
miles, and constantly extending to every quarter of the
compass. Consider that, collect!vebq at insignificant
intervals, thousands of claims have been located ; that
each of these claims is intersected by a lode, whether
good, bad or indifferent, and then sit down and solemnly
sum up the net potentialities of such a field. The one
thing necessary to success is a bountiful water supply.
That is merely a question of a couple of millions of money.
In two years Esperanoe Bay will undoubtedly be brought
to the back-doors of Conlgardie. Then not only will the
mines, for various reasons, be on a better footing for
economical working than any other group in Australasia,
but the country will be rendered fit for man and beast. I
am no optimist. Five years hence let this picture tie
brought to light.— Leslie A. Norman. Coolgardie, 16th
March, '95.

promising; and VVestralia will have to do a lot better
before it fulfils its promise. The other figures have no
comparative value ; as most of the gold from the other

It is believed that gold exists in quantity in the
larger islands of the Solomon group, but several adven-
turers have been unable to effectually prospect, owing to
the warlike inhabitants and reptiles.

One of the interesting features of the
debate on the Eight Hours Bill in N.S. Wales
Assembly was the anxiety of many warm sup-
porters to have the principal industries of their
own electorates exempted. Tne military, naval,
and volunteer forces, policemen, shepherds, stock-
men, reapers, mowers, haymakers, and domestic
servants were exempted in the first place. Then
O'Sullivan demanded that carriers, dairymen,
drovers, orehardists, vignerons, and agricultural
laborers should not be subject to the compulsory
eight hours. Hassall demanded exemption for
shearers; Macdonald wanted station employes left
out; Willis asked for exemption for persons em-
ployed by homestead lessees and selectors ; O'Sul-
livan again suggested mailmen and rouseabouts ;
other members proposed the exemption of
engineers, plasterers, bricklayers, carpenters,
laborers, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, gunsmiths,
compositors, saddlers, collar-makers, stonemasons,
brickmakers, pilots, tide-waiters, watchmen, bark-
strippers, timber-getters, and many others. A
good many of the exemptions were carried, and if
they had all been carried the Bill would finally
have applied to nobody except the hangman.
Somehow nobody seems to have thought of exempt-
ing him.
A.D. 1895.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As in some quiet city swathed in sleep,
Where like a kiss the twilight lingereth,
When suddenly the earth stirs far beneath—
Just moves, then pauses—and a silence deep
Falls on all ere the second shock should sweep
Spire, column, turret-all to shapeless death !
And white face peers at white face, while no
breath
Is drawn and every heart forgets to leap !
So now across this quiet, dreaming world
The first faint shook has thrilled, and men,
aghast,
Wait for the second, whose blind forces pent,
Shall find in one fierce, vast convulsion vent;
When all the builded fabrics of the past
Shall be in ruins on their builders hurled !

The Jews claim 110 births of boys to every
100 girls. Other people, 105 boys.
At a recent London old postage stamp sale,
a “Queensland first issue shilling violet imper-
fect” was sold for <£'33; and a “New Zealand,
watermark N.Z., one penny brown,” sold lor £35.
The latter is a very rare stamp : only two or three
others are known to exist.
A Yankee inventor reckons that he has
discovered a new and dreadful engine of war. He
believes he can construct magnets of such power
that when a fortified place is protected by a few
dozen of them an ironclad coming within fighting
distance will be seized by their attraction and
forcibly dragged ashore. If the place is attacked
by land the magnets will attract the cannon,
rifles, swords, bayonets, &c., so forcibly that
before the assailants get within shooting distance
their weapons will rise up under an invisible in-
fluence and rush off by themselves into the hands
of the enemy. Also, the magnates will snatch
away the metallic parts of the harness, and the
wheels of the ammunition waggons, and the steel
trappings of the troops, and if these latter are too
firmly fixed they will take the troops along as
well. Evidently war is going to wear a humorous
asnect when the great invention gets into working
crd r.
Probably the farthest shot into the upper
air contrived by human ingenuity was a balloon,
the “Cirrus,” launched last July by a German
meteorologist. The interior was fitted with baro-
meter and thermometer, the movements of which
were photographically recorded on a drum re-
volved by clockwork. When released, the
“Cirrus” shot up like a champagne cork, sailed
out of sight, and, 11 hours later, having travelled
620 miles from Berlin, fell in Bosnia, near the
Servian frontier. Opened by the owner on her
return to the observatory, the “ Cirrus ” was seen
to have soared past the register of the contained
apparatus. Where the story of her voyage was
abruptly ended she was sailing upwards at the
tremendous height of 53,559 ft., or nearly twice
the altitude of Mt, Everest, the tallest peak on
earth ; here the last entry in her log gave a pres-
sure of 3‘35in., as against 30 at starting, and a
cold of minus 61 degrees Fahrenheit, as against
plus 61 at the earth’s surface. Prof. Assman will
make another attempt to study the world above
the clouds by sending up another balloon provided
with wider indices and timed for longer hours.

The stampede
for the Bulletin.
All were sleeping. I was watching,
Sitting weary on my horse.
Fifteen hundred head of cattle
Camped beside the old racecourse.
Fifteen hundred head of devils,
Three months out upon the road,
Sleepless nights and days of watching—
Drover’s life a heavy load.
In the old and ancient Scriptures
Devils entered into swine ;
Wait and see the devils enter
Fifteen hundred head of kine !
When they start at every crackle,
Break and clear out every night;
When they smash through heavy mulga,
Split in two mobs, left and right.
I have seen it, I have suffered,
Worst of all three days from Bourke,
Calm and happy, almost jolly—
Truck in three days, finished work.
Starry night with grass and shelter,
Whips of water in the creek,
Nothing in the world to startle
Cattle, even.out a week.
Rush! a bellow, then a circle—
Curse the devils left and right I
Off, as usual, hard we galloped,
Seemed to gallop half the night.
When we got them, oh, the smashing !
Some were killed and some were hurt;
For we got them in a gully
Mixed up with the rocks and dirt.
Joe and Charlie both disabled,
Lungs are injured, ribs are smashed,
Night-horse will not see the sunrise,
Over heart he’s badly gashed.
If I ever more go droving
When the doctor says I’m fit,
I’ll drive goats and pigs in future,
Not another horse I’ll sit.

Land of the Crocodile,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Land of the Crocodile is in a state of
quiescence financially, politically, and otherwise.
It may be the period before some wild explosion :
Brief silence, like the pause between the flash
Of lightning anti the fallowing thunder crash.
Many a sad-eyed ex-land agent walks moodily
around, inwardly cursing the optimistic bard who
declared that it is better to have boomed and
bust than never to have boomed at all.. In one of
Caroline Gillman’s novels a lady said there is
nothing so beautiful as a handsome and virtuous
young man. To this an old maid remarked, “ Ah,
yes ! even if he is not virtuous !” Bananaland’s
parsons exclaim, “How glorious is honest pros-
perity !” and the crowd responds, “ Amen, O
Lord ! even if it is not severely honest!”

Mrs. Campbeli-Praed has come and gone.
She has visited the land of her birth, in response
to the Ossianic voice which “awakes the soul;
the voice of years that are gone, that roll before
us with all their deeds.” 1 called to see her at
the hotel and found her the centre of a group
better qualified to preserve silence than break it
successfully. She has a soft, kind face and sweet
voice, a subdued, lambent fire in the eyes,
a veiled expression of settled melancholy,
and a manner at once sympathetic and refined.
She has gone via Torres Strait and Java to reach
England on a fixed date. Next morning an old
pioneer told me he remembered her birth in 1847
or 1848, and nursed her many a time. She was
the first daughter of the late Murray Prior, wdio
married her mother, a Miss Harpur, member of a
North of Ireland Protestant family, near Parra-
matta, The late 0. R. Daly married Rosie
Harpur (Mrs. Prior’s sister).

Meeting that veteran ex-legislator, P.
O’Sullivan, a member of the first Parliament of
1860, recalled the time when he was in charge of
a station, and was bailed up by four armed bush-
rangers. “Gintlemin,” he remarked, “it seems
moighty little use expostulaytin’ wid four min
wid guns ! Here are the kays of the shtore!”
They appreciated the humor of the genial Hiber-
nian, and took only a few pounds of tea and sugar.

Among recent ornamental promenaders of
Brisbane “ block ’’were a couple of native-police
officers, heroes of a hundred (bar-parlor) deadly
combats with ferocious myalls. One of (say)
Scowlman’s old troopers told me of a little inci-
dent in the career of his chief. A myall had
committed some outrage on a woman, and Scowl-
man and his troopers searched for him in vain.
Finally Scowlman rode up to the camp of the
tribe to which the myall belonged and gave warn-
ing that unless they found and brought him in he
and his men would come do wn and shoot every
soul in the place. Stimulated by this common
native-police tonic, six warriors started on the
warpath and ran the myall down on a neighbour-
ing station, first arranging with Scowlman to
meet them at a certain place on a certain day.
On that day, the squatter on whose place the
woman had been outraged was riding quietly
up to the home station, when he overtook a black-
fellow carrying something in a bag. “ Hillo,
Dick! what have you got in there? That fellow
turkey-egg?” “Baal!” said the blackfellow,
turning out the contents—the fresh head of a
myall recently killed ! The six warriors,'being
doubtful of bringing the live man to the station
and dreading Scowlman’s threat, had killed the
prisoner and sent only his head, for publication
as a substantial guarantee of good faith.

A well-known Northern clergyman, re-
markable for his disregard of conventionalities,
caused a wild flutter in the female dovecots. A
middle-aged lady was deputed to call on the parson
and remonstrate. He received her in his private
room at the church. After much preliminary cir-
cumlocutory gabble, she approached the subject.
“Just think what people will say about it!’’
“ Yes, madame,” said the humorous cleric, “ and
what would people say if they heard you were
locked up in this room with me for the last half-
hour, and the key in my pocket?” For such was the
case—unknown to the lady—and on her promise
not to mention the actress again he agreed to let
the key story stand over to some future date.

In the far West. Party of bushmen
round a gidya-fire toasting emu eggs. Discussion
on discovery of Australia. Opinions divided, but
majority in favor of Cook. One man took no
part in the argument, only sat in silence amd
watched the fire, and rose at intervals to bring
more gidya. He was a tall, slabsided jabiroo with
red hair, and had been camped for three months
on a Paroo billabong by himself, living on fish and
wallaby. Discussion on Cook and early discovery
summed up by the jabiroo rising for a gidya
hunt and solemnly, with deep emphasis, remark-
ing : “It’s a pity anybody ever did discover the
blanky country ! ” Next subject is the Czar of
Russia and his numerous escapes. The jabiroo
rises as usual for more gidya and oracularly
observes : “ By crypse that cove ’ll fall in the
muck one o’ these times 1 ”

“ Gintlemin ! ” said a Hibernian orator at
a recent Q. festivity, “ Give bin twinty year in all
parts of this oounthry, and whin I remimbir that
I came from an ould and ainshint and highly
respicted Oirish family who fought at Clontarf wid
Brian Boroo, and thin think of mesilf for twinty
year wid no companions but shnakes and woild
blacks, an’ kangaroos, an’ allygators, and a lot of
other dam insecs like thim, it makes me blud boil
all over the top o’ me ! ” (Tremendous applause.)

Marriage of a timber-getter to a bush
bride. Parson asks : “ Wilt thou have this
woman,” &c. No answer. Bash-bride: “Oh,
Tom, darling, do say you’ll have me !” Tom sul-
lenly : “ All right! let the parson clear the chocks
and start the waggon !” The bride was widow
of another timber-getter whose baptismal name
she had forgotten, so she described herself in the
marriage-register as the “Widow of Wall-Eyed
Bill ” ! This happened within 30 miles of Bris-
bane. [Very likely. —Ed. B.]

On the Logan lived a Hibernian selector,
each of whose cows had about 10 three-year-old
calves every year, and who came nearly stocking a
station with, the progeny of half-a-dozen old
milkers. His beef had cost him nothing for 20
years. A sudden sickness brought the fear of
death, and with that there came remorse and a
desire to confess his sins. But the visiting priest
was an Irishman who believed that Mick Ryan
(as we shall call him) was the most honest man on
the Logan, and Mick was not equal to laying bare
all the skeletons (of his neighbors’ cattle) in the
dark cupboard of his soul. But there came a
rumor that Father Scortechini, an Italian priest,
had been appointed to that district, and Mick’s
wife rushed into the sick man’s room with the
following proposal: “ Good news, Mick ! There’s
an Eyetallian praste with a name like Scorcha-
jinnie cummin’ down here to-morrow. Shure the
divil a word he knows of either Inglish or Oirish,
and you can confess all about thim cattle and get
absolution ! for the divil a word he’ll know what
you’re talkin’ about! ”

Fitzgeralds Circus arrived in a small
Maoriland town and erected its tent, limited to
one pole and a “round-top,” however, to meet
the requirements of a circumscribed population.
It was one of those towns peculiar to M.L., which
never seem to contain many people, and yet it
managed to run two newspapers, a brass band,
several pubs and chureheB . The circus band .

were admitted. Meanwhile, the local clergy came

of clergy. Then the press dropped in nume
rously, each with a lady or a friend. Finding
themselves inside without paying, the bandsmen
went out and brought their wives back with them.
Meanwhile, eight adults and 25 children paid for
admission, and 14 kids got in under the canvas
during the astonishment of the proprietors,
People kept rolling up, and, repeating the magic
words, “Band” or “ Press,” marched in and sat
down in front seats. When the show got away

put in Alpha separators, so as to get the greatest possible

THE GREAT TEST MATCH ,
BETWEEN the SONS. OF the LITHE WILLOW OF MOTHER ENGLAND and the COLONIES,
Which has caused all but universal interest, suggests the thought whether anyone has ever remarked
on a far greater Test than this.
This is the great Test which has been applied to the PRINCE OF WALES HOTEL for the
last quarter of a century, and which it has gloriously withstood, satisfied and won; and to-day it
stands out more boldly, more defiantly, more honored by the thousands of patrons who daily visit
the Quaint Old House.
F. R. LARKIN invites the Government Inspectors, Connoisseurs of WINES and SPIRITS, to
C' 'ME and INSPECT, SAMPLE and TEST the QUALITY and PRICES of his GENERAL
STOCK.
TEAS of the FIRST QUALITY (this Season’s pick) ON HAND. A Large Assortment
to select from.
