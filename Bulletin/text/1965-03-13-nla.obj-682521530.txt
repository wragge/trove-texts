“WHY DON’T WE PUT THE PRICE UP?”
SAID THE BRANCH MANAGER
Why don't we put the price up? It seemed to be a good
question in view of the reaction to Miamba Hock, since it
joined the family of Orlando table wines recently. Because,
as a Bin Wine, the quantity available in each binning is
limited. But, w'e aren’t putting the price up - because Orlando
is proud to have produced a new, true Bin white wine at a
medium price that has been so well accepted. Order Bin i
Miamba Hock now.
FOR THOSE WHOSE INTEREST
GOES BEYOND THE TASTE
Miamba Hock is produced from grapes of
the Hunter River Riesling, Tokay and Rhine;
Riesling grape varieties under the same
controlled fermentation process that is used
to make Orlando’s outstanding, award
winning Barossa Riesling. It has an excep-
tional bouquet and crisp finish.

Sketch, Gateway Arch, St. Louis, Missouri.
Savour the romance
of life along the
mighty Mississippi
From gourmet dining to diamond
hunting—your holiday this year can
cost amazingly little.
Near the mouth of the Mississippi is ‘‘The
City Care Forgot,” New Orleans, Louisiana.
During Spring Fiesta, April 3-18, a, car-
nival spirit reigns with parades, art shows
and tours of homes and gardens.
And in New Orleans you can still hear
the last of the original jazz musicians.
Try Creole dishes like Gumbo and Pom-
pano en Papillotte. And enjoy a traditional
“Mint Julep” ... a delightful blend of
Kentucky bourbon, ice and mint.
The Old South—and the New
Rent a car (as little as £2/4/- a day, 9d.
a mile) for a scenic two-hour drive along
the Gulf of Mexico to Biloxi, Mississippi.
Or go north to Natchez. Nowhere are
pre-Civil War mansions better preserved.
Further up-river is fast-growing Mem-
phis, Tennessee, birthplace of the “Blues.”
Plan to be there for the mid-May Cotton
Carnival, or the Mid-South Fair in Sep-
tember. The Cotton Exchange, overlook-
ing the river, is a favorite with visitors.
Two authentic early American homes,
Magevney House and Fontaine House,
also" attract great attention.
From Memphis, take an overnight trip
to the spas of Hot Springs National Park,
Arkansas. Or visit the Crater of Diamonds
near Murfreesboro. Keep any diamonds
you find; visitors have discovered over
5,000 of them!
Gateway to the West
Next, visit St. Louis, Missouri, celebrat-
ing its 200th anniversary. Here, the pio-
neers gathered before going on west. The
new 630-foot Gateway Arch honors those
adventure-filled days.
Today, St. Louis is proud of its Muni-
cipal Opera, Symphony Orchestra. Botani-
cal Gardens and Zoo.
Travel many ways—costs are low
New Orleans to St. Louis is only
£B/9/3 one way by bus. Or, for 99 days
.of unlimited travel, buy the special
£44/3/11 ticket before you leave home.
U.S. air fares are among the lowest any-
where. You will find trains are comfort-
able, relaxing.
m
Preservation Hall, New Orleans, La.
Your holiday will be even more fun if
you include the New York World’s Fair
(April 21—October 17, 1965). Ask your
travel adviser how easy it is to travel
between New York and the Mississippi
River area. And, remember, you can
apply for your visitor’s visa by mail to
the American Consulate.

Is there a CRANE in your refrigerator?
Instead of the labyrinth of tubing which used
to be in your refrigerator, these days you’ll
more than likely find a Crane evaporator
plate. This is a result of much research and
planning by Crane Copper & Aluminium Pty.
Ltd., just one of the companies in the G. E.
Crane Group. Crane Copper & Aluminium
Pty. Ltd. also supplies aluminium, brass and
copper in flat sheets, rolls, coils, ex-
trusions, strips, etc. to companies who
turn it into such items as saucepans, kitchen
furniture, kettles, milk bottle tops, hundreds
of things we see and use in everyday life.
Other companies in the group aid a diversity
of Australian industries, too. G. E. Crane Pty..
Ltd. supply all kinds of brassware to the
plumbing trade, and Crane Products Pty. Ltd.
manufactures building sheet in five profiles.
Crane Enfield Metals supply a large share
of Australia’s. copper tube and aluminium
extrusion requirements and also manufacture
aluminium tube.
In fact if you have any problem involving
aluminium, brass or copper for saucepans,
salt shakers or even ships, it's almost certain
that Crane’s will have the answer.

STC PABX Crossbar Pentaconta intro-
duces entirely new refinements to
executive levels of telecommunication.
Streamlined, automated, the system
creates a climate of extreme efficiency
and simplicity and reflects these attri-
butes to each caller into the system.
Handling of local, national, or inter-
national calls by the executive supplies
a significant example. By pressing the
button on the front of the telephone,
such calls can be held while another call
is made either internally or outside seek-
ing information. The button provides the
means of transferring incoming calls
internally without recourse to the push-
button Pentaconta switchboard. Top
level executive contact with the tele-
phonist is via the same button on the
telephone as is immediate access to an
outgoing exchange line.

National Notebook
Instant Inspiration
/Composer Nigel Butterley, quietly-
spoken and unassuming, arrived by
request at our office last week and won-
dered what it was we might like to
know about him. Yes, he was delighted
that the music publishers, J. Albert and
Son, had signed him up in Sydney on a
three-year contract to have first option
on any music he composes in that time.
But would people really be interested
in knowing much about him, personally?
It had been a pretty mundane life, so
far. Just 29, he had not begun writing
music until he was 15 and he thought
that was rather late for a composer.
“My first pieces were written for
piano which I had been learning since
I was six. They were played on the
ABC's ‘Young Australia’ programme.
I was at Sydney Grammar at the time
and doing a music subject privately as
the school didn't have a teacher for it.
But when I got honors the headmaster
said it was good for the school . . . V I
then joined the ABC music department
and now produce programmes for them
and write scripts to accompany orches-
tral renditions and such,” he said.
A year in London studying with
Priaulx Rainier in ’62 had been the
best thing he ever did, he felt. “She
taught me not to always write in phrases
that seemed to be naturally required
because of what had gone before. She
showed me how much of my composing
was predictable, in that sense. She
really led me to a much greater appre-
ciation of what I could do musically.”
The Rainier influence in Butterley’s
successful instrumental octet for brass,
woodwinds, strings and piano, he freely
admitted, and said he was grateful for
it. “The whole thing came to me in a
flash—l know that must sound awful,
but it did—while I was standing in the
church of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo at
Ravenna during winter. Suddenly I
could see every single note of it. It
was a marvellous moment for me when
I got it down and it was still the same.”
Instant inspiration, however, was also
required for the two-minute piece for
sopranino recorder and harpsichord
which he wrote in one day for Carl
Dolmetsch and Joseph Saxby to play at
Sydney's Conservatorium. “I was told
that if 1 could write it that day then
Dolmetsch would play it at the week-
end.” Called “The White-Throated
Warbler” it sounded just like that, he
said, and he had been careful not to
make it too intricate to play as he knew
it was a rush job for Dolmetsch to
learn.
What would he have to offer Albert’s
this year? “Well, I have in mind an
orchestral work and a string quartet and
a composition for school performance
that is scheduled for the UNESCO
seminar concert here in May. I hope
that will keep them happy. I know I
shall be if I can complete them by
Christmas,” he smiled before returning
to work at the ABC.
Long , Long Ago
Tt was fitting that the Moscow Circus
should arrive in Melbourne just
as the Scientology enquiry was ending,
and that it should set up camp only a
tightrope length from the National Her-
barium where the enquiry was held.
But even the skilled Soviet performers
may not be able to match the Sciento-
logy enquiry as public entertainment.
The Scientology enquiry ran for 12
months, using over 3 t-million words and
hearing 149 witnesses.
One witness, a leading-hand painter,
described a trip he took 45 trillion years
ago in a small space craft from a planet
called Euriphodes. Stops on the trip
included the planet Helitrobus, and Hea-
ven. The trip took 6000 light years.
The Helitrobi, by the way, are sexless.
Mr Anderson, QC, who conducted the
enquiry, was informed that the Helitrobi
are made in factories.
A Geelong engineer told Mr Ander-
son that Scientology had uncovered
that he had a past life and had revealed
a past incident that took place
“42,640,721.969,731 years, 156 days,
18 hours, 19 minutes and 37 seconds
ago”. He also had an impression of a
car crash 500,000 years ago. Mr Ander-
son suggested to him that it may have
been a chariot crash.
Mr Anderson's report is likely to be
ready in April, and the State Govern-
ment is almost certain to legislate on
Scientology in accordance with his find-
ings.
Brave Band
*0 obert Flemyng is one of that brave
band of English actors whose faces
are very familiar from films and tele-
vision, but whose faces don't always have
a name to go with them However,
Australian audiences are likely to be
able to put a name to his face after
seeing it on stage in “Difference of
Opinion'’, which opens at the Comedy,
Melbourne, later this month.
Mr Flemyng is quite philosophical
about his position which so often is just
left of the earhole of the leading man.
He is quite philosophical, too, about
what has happened to his generation
of actors.
“It seems a pity that there is such a
passion for fashion in London,” he told
us.'“but, really, what can you do about
it? And I have to remember there was
a stage when I thought the sort of play
I played in and the sort of par I played
\\4ould go on forever. My first big role
was in ‘French Without Tears’ with Rex
Harrison, Kay Hammond, Trevor
Howard and Jessica Tandy. We thought
it would run forever. And it did run for
2] years, which was an enormously long
run then and a much longer time than
plays run these days. But it finished at
last and then we all had to begin over
again.”
Mr Flemyng began all over again by
"I like it the dog likes it How about you, Hammond, Grimshaw?"

making his first visit to New York. He
has since appeared on the New York
stage almost as often as the London and
has a particular affection for Americans.
One of his most successful roles was in
“The Cocktail Party”, in which he
appeared first at the Edinburgh Festival.
This, he feels, is the sort of play that
an actor gets only, perhaps, once in ten
years.
Mr Flemyng does not believe that the
alleged current shortage of good plays
is any new thing. “There wasn’t any par-
ticular difficulty in this regard before
because actors didn’t worry about going
on forever in the same role,” he said.
“Everyone now says that John Gielgud
is ‘too old’ for Richard the Second, so
that John is always casting about for
new parts. He’s got one at the moment
with ‘Tiny Alice’. But I said to him one
day that if we were still back in Irving's
day he would go on playing ‘Richard
of Bordeaux’ until he dropped. It's not
that plays are scarce but audiences
demand better ones.”
A Dip in the Pool
TT'our baby-blue swimming pools at the
all-new £90,000 pools display centre
of Frank O'Neill Industries Ltd, at
the North Shore suburb of Pymble,
were carefully defined in the official
hand-out as “outdoor pools”. The im-
plied reminder that there are also
“indoor pools” available for the luxury-
conscious did not pass unnoticed at the
centre's recent opening. “We’ve built
3000 pools in all sizes, shapes and situa-
tions during the past six years,” the
eminently successful Mr O'Neill told us
between hand-shakes. Well-wishers,
some of them shareholders, beamed
congratulations and approval.
Listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange
before Christmas, a parcel of 160,000
shares in Frank O'Neill Industries offer-
ed at ss. 3d. each were selling last week
at Bs. 6d. “We hope to sec the original
shares treble in value this year. Already
we've got orders coming in at a fantas-
tic rate for swimming pools all over
the country,” Frank O'Neill said. He
added that he expects his firm to build
5000 pools in Australia within the ne v t
12 months (since it got going in 1958 the
firm has built 3000 k
At 38. O'Neill, the 1952 world record
holder of the 330-vard swimming med-
ley, expects to set new records in the
bathing business now that the boom is
here.
“We follow American trends very
closely indeed. Last year they built 70,000
pools in America. That’s more than
they've built in any one year before. It
will be the same sort of thing in Aus-
tralia. As long as people are build-
ing new homes or getting the swimming
pool habit in their old homes this boom
will last.”
Now established as a man of business,
Frank O’Neill will talk about any aspect
of his life so far except his marriage
in 1950 to the Honorable Patricia
Cavendish, daughter of the Countess of
Kenmare. “We have since separated,”
he said. “There are other things I'd
prefer to discuss now.”
Among them: his coaching in 1952
of celebrities he and his wife met on
their travels overseas. “Somerset
Maugham wanted to learn to dive. He
was in his late seventies then and looked
his age about his face but was in pretty
good shape bodily. He could only learn
to sidestroke, however. None of that
set could swim much.”
The O'Neill business success story be-
gan in 1958 when, having built his own
swimming school’s pool at Pymhle, he
joined with Mr Ellis Champion and Mr
Ken Stephens from across the road to
form Frank O'Neill Swimming Pools
Pty Ltd. “It's nothing like Esther Wil-
liams. Her copyrighted pools come in
pre-designed models. Ours are built to
anv specifications to fit any space.”
(Standard charge for an O'Neill pool,
30ft by 15ft, or anv shaned area of
450 square feet, is £1295.)
Frank O’Neill Industries Ltd was
incorporated in 1959 and operates
throueh its two subsidiaries. Frank
O'Neill Swimming Pools and Swimming
Pool Equipment. “My present title is
that of sales director of Frank O'Neill
Industries,” O'Neill said.
In 1959 his company built five pools,
all in Sydney. At the close of 1960 it
had built another 50 in NSW. Now
O'Neill is Australia’s major swimming
pool builder. “American methods of
construction and salesmanship have
always held my interest,” he told us. (At
the official Pymble opening the NSW
Deputy Premier, Mr Pat Hills, deliver-
ed his opening address from a diving
board.)
O’Neill - built therapeutic swimming
pools have been installed at the Margaret
Reid Hospital for crippled children at
Sydney’s St Ives and at the Royal Prince
Alfred at Camperdown. “We’ve also
done a recreational pool at the Lorna
Hodgkinson Sunshine Home at Gore
Hill, plus all sorts of pools for country
people.” He points out that the average-
sized pool (15ft by 30ft) holds 14,000
gallons of water which, with the aid of a
hand pump, can be a boon during bush-
fires.
“Last year 500 of our pools were
built in Sydney suburban homes. Half
of them were installed on time payment.
We are able to help customers arrange
finance for their pools through an HP
company.” The play-now. pay-later
scheme is expected to account for an
increasing proportion of the O’Neill pool
orders this year.

THE LITTLE BOY FROM MANLY
feulletia
80 Years Ago: March 14, 1885
T ivingston Hopkins (“ Hop”)
had joined The BuELETtN
staff in 1883 and was still
searching for a figure that
would symbolise Australia the
way Uncle Sam and John Bull
symbolised America and Eng-
land. The following paragraph
gave him the germ of the idea
for his final solution—the
famous “Little Boy from
Manly”—a nicely dressed little
boy who, trying to be helpful,
kept asking awkward questions.
Mr Dali.ey recently received
a letter (enclosing £2O)
.from a “little boy at Manly”, of
which the following are ex-
tracts: “Father has been read-
ing to us the life of General
Gordon, and 1 could not help
thinking what a good man he
was, and how he was killed;
and although I have asked
often if I could do something
to help our soldiers who went
away [to Soudan] yesterday, 1
always received the same an-
swer: I was too young, and
must wait till I am a man.
“Yesterday, I begged to be
allowed to do something, even
if it was to send what little
money 1 had saved up to the
Patriotic Fund, for the poor
widows and orphans, and at
last father has not only con-
sented, but gave me something
to add to it.”
In reply to this, the little boy
from Manly received a letter
from the omnipotent “W.8.D.”
from which we hack out the
appended: “You will grow up,
I am sure, a noble, brave,
generous boy, and you will
always have in your mind what
you saw on Tuesday, and be
always proud of what you have
done and written today.—l
am, etc., W. B. Dailey.”

Twenty Years Without a Policy
YI/hen even the British magazine
” “New Statesman” supports the
US bombing of North Vietnam, one
may reasonably feel that some radical
changes are going on in British think-
ing about global policy. “It is easy to
condemn American retaliatory raids
on North Vietnam bases,” says that
socialist journal in a recent editorial,
but it is “much more difficult to suggest
a constructive alternative,” since the
loss of South Vietnam would obviously
lead to the loss of the rest of
Asia. This sort of thinking in Labor
circles, combined with the Labor Gov-
ernment’s “East of Suez” defence
policy, may indicate the reversal of the
policies by which Britain was not only
withdrawing from Asia, but in effect
undermining the United States’ policy
there. If the “East of Suez” policy
lasts only for the next 10 to 20 years,
it could still be of decisive influence
for freedom in Asia.
It is, however, only a beginning, and
there is still no proper co-ordination of
the US-UK operations against the com-
mon threat. While the British Govern-
ment aids Malaysia, it continues to
make noises in favor of the sort of
“negotiation” (i.e., defeat) in South
Vietnam, which would destroy Malay-
sia. While America spills its blood
and treasure in South Vietnam, it
continues to aid Indonesia in its war
on Malaysia. On the sidelines, France,
under the illusion that the “nuclear
stalemate” (for this purpose Red China
does not exist) and “Sino-Soviet split”
have stopped the advance of Com-
munism, is trying to push the West
into its biggest defeat since the fall of
China. Australia for its part makes
loud anti-Communist noises but con-
tinues a trade policy towards Red
China which risks making us dependent
on the Communists.
Until the anti-Communist leaders
co-ordinate their policies and offer the
sort of leadership that will bring India
and Japan into the alliance, the posi-
tion will remain grave. The West is now
inheriting the results of twenty years
without a coherent Asian policy, but
with American revision of its Indo-
nesian policy and British revision of
its Vietnamese policy we may at last
be at the beginning of a new era.
The Case of the FN Rifle
‘T’he Brisbane dentist who last week
-*■ found the hand of international
Communism behind the Australian pro-
duction of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?” provided a good laugh all
round, not only for those who enjoy
ridiculing people who find Communists
under the bed. Meanwhile the Com-
munist takeover of the Amalgamated
Engineering Union passed almost with-
out comment. As a result of the defeat
of Mr J. McDowell in the recent
elections, the No. 1 Division of the
union’s Commonwealth Council is now
made up of one Communist Party
member and four ALP members, all
but one of whom have been elected
with Communist Party backing, in
each case defeating an anti-Communist
ALP member. This has a grim signifi-
cance for Australian defence, since, as
last year’s strikes in defence establish-
ments show, the AEU has the strength
to undermine these establishments
whenever it can manufacture a suit-
able issue (and the record shows that
the Department of Supply officials have
been only slightly more sophisticated
than the Government of Queensland
in their handling of Communist oper-
ations).
The case of the FN rifle is especially
illuminating. In 1958 the Department
of Supply introduced the new FN
rifle project to the small arms factory
at Lithgow, NSW, applying new
Industrial Engineering techniques to
ensure maximum efficiency. The plans
were extended to the ammunition fac-
tory at Footscray, Victoria. These
new techniques were successful and
led to increased production, increas-
ed wages and increased exports, until
in 1960 the Communist Party decided
to call a halt to the project. For over
four years a series of strikes were
staged by the AEU in opposition to
the new techniques, involving not only
serious production losses but suffering
to more than a hundred families.
Within the AEU the main opposition
to these tactics was Mr McDowell,
who finally triumphed at a meeting
at Lithgow Trades Hall in January this
year. Now, however, the Communist-
inspired defeat of McDowell has been
achieved and it is safe to predict that
there will be more disruption of defence
production on the lines of the past
defence strikes and the strikes at Gen-
eral Motors-Holden’s or Mt Isa and
in line with Communist disruption of
northern development.
Churchill
TffiE tremendous success of the Chur-
A chill Appeal is welcome not only
because it assures the scholarship
scheme but because it shows how wide-
spread was the public acceptance of the
principle behind the appeal. It is inter-
esting, however, to note the main
sources of opposition to the appeal.
Some were quite trivial and do not bear
discussion; for example, the nationalist
opposition because Churchill was an
Englishman, or the class-war opposi-
tion because Churchill belonged to a
conservative party. (See story on the
Barrier Industrial Council, page 15.)
More significant and far more under-
standable was the opposition among
many New Australians. In some sub-
urbs indeed, where New Australians are
strong in numbers, the contributions
were derisively small.
The point is: how could Churchill be
a hero to people from Poland, Czecho-
slovakia or Yugoslavia who believe
that their countries were betrayed by
the West? For them it is difficult to
forget Yalta, which Churchill supported
but which meant the enslavement of
Eastern Europe from which they are
only now beginning to recover. When,
for example, Brigadier Maclean warn-
ed Churchill during the war that Mar-
shal Tito was preparing a Communist
revolution, Churchill replied contemp-
tuously: “Do you intend to make Yugo-
slavia your home after the war?”
Churchill’s services to humanity
were colossal, but it is foolish to deify
him as some recent publicity tended to
do, and it is certainly important for
Australians to realise that some of our
fellow citizens were on the receiving
end of the Yalta decisions and, under-
standably, do not share the general
idolatry of that great man.


THIS AUSTRALIA
MT ISA
Where Is All the
Money From?
The reinstatement Mackie does not want
By Alan Reid
BRISBANE The Mount Isa dispute
has become cruelly grotesque. Mr Pat
Mackie and the Committee for Manage-
ment Control have asked the workers at
the mine not to go back to work until
the Mount Isa Mine management re-
instates Mackie, despite the gains
achieved for mine workers by the Aus-
tralian Workers’ Union. Yet the one
person who does not need reinstatement
is Mackie.
As a direct result of the strike, Mackie,
unlike the strikers he is urging to go
hungry with their families on his behalf,
has obtained a good position, the Parlia-
mentary backing of Mr Clyde Cameron
(Labor, SA) and Dr J. Cairns (Labor,
Vic.) both members of the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party Executive
who could confidently expect to be high
ranking Ministers if a Labor Govern-
ment were returned to power Federally.
And Mackie, with funds from some
source will go stumping the State of
Queensland tying up other industries
while simultaneously seeking to smash
the Australian Workers’ Union, the
main anti-Communist industrial force
in the north.
The position Mackie had acquired is
that of National Secretary of the Com-
mittee for Membership Control. The
inspiration behind the CMC is Mr Clyde
Cameron, who was formerly State Sec-
retary for the AWU in South Australia
but who, since he used the AWU as a
stepping stone in to the Federal Parlia-
ment, has been the harshest critic of the
AWU in Australia. AWU officials have
repeatedly described it as a “scab”
organisation which is seeking to break
the power of the union which is
nationalist in its approach and to hand
over the AWU’s enormous strength,
tremendous financial resources, and key
position in the Australian industrial
structure to Leftist forces.
These same officials have examined
the CMC personnel and resources closely,
and claim that it had the backing of Mr
Cameron, a handful of malcontents,
mostly Communists, who have their base
in. Broken Hill, and a few frightened
people in South Australia who fear for
their positions because Mr Cameron's
power within the South Australian ALP
machine (which is exercised mainly
through the “card” vote, which is a
system he is said by AWU officials to
have introduced when he was the SA
AWU State secretary).
DR J. CAIRNS
This seemed to be the position until
the Mount Isa dispute. The CMC was
constantly struggling to foot the bills
for its propaganda; now it has, or appears
to have, significant funds. The question
the AWU officials are asking
legitimately—is who is footing the bills?
The Mount Isa workers, despite the
manner in which Mackie (who joined the
AWU as Markey) has them hypnotised,
cannot possibly be paying. They cannot
have large financial resources left after
their prolonged battle to get Mackie the
reinstatement that he does not want and
the CMC National Secretaryship, accept-
ance of which he has already announced.
Possibly Mr Mackie and Mr Cameron
are counting on there being sufficient left
over from the contributions made by
unions throughout Australia, many of
them Communist-led, for the upkeep of
workers battling and exposing their
families to financial hardship. Possibly,
too, the Communist Party has come to

the aid of the Mackie-Cameron-Cairns
Party. If the AWU, which whatever its
faults is vehemently Australian in its
outlook, supports Australian defence
and northern development (and has over
the years been the largest and most loyal
contributor to ALP fighting funds)
passes into Leftist control it would be
worthwhile for any party and par-
ticularly the Communist Party to pay a
high price.
It would mean that the Communist
Party working through the Communist-
influenced Queensland Trades and Labor
Council would have complete control
of northern Queensland in these days
of international tension a not insensitive
part of the Australian continent.
There seems to be no doubt that the
Mount Isa dispute if it drags on much
longer could spill over into the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party room. It
could even eclipse in importance the
advocacy by Deputy Senate Labor
Leader Pat Kennedy of a round-table
conference between the ALP and the
Democratic Labor Party to secure a
united Labor Party, for the same theme
that Labor needs internal reformation
runs through the AWU issue.
The Mount Isa dispute—and the parts
played in it by Mr Cameron and Dr
Cairns, who has publicly supported Mr
Mackie and arranged for Mr Mackie the
unusual forum of a church pulpit is
already lifting the curtain fascinatingly
on some of the things that go on within
the ALP machine.
The February 24 issue of “The
Worker”, official organ of the AWU
which contains the official report of the
AWU Convention debate which produced
the AWU decision to withdraw all
financial and physical assistance from
the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party,
reveals happenings at Federal ALP con-
ferences and Federal ALP executives are
seen through the eyes of men who have
actively participated in their proceedings.
One portion of the official report
dealt with a speech by Mr W. Ramsay,
Tasmania AWU secretary and a frequent
delegate from Tasmania to ALP Federal
Executive and Conference. The official
report read: “He (Mr Ramsay) said that
every Federal Executive meeting of the
ALP he had attended . . . people com-
plained about the interference of Federal
officials, not Parliamentarians, in the in-
ternal workings of unions, because Vic-
toria had been famous for its unity
tickets, and still was to an extent.
“When there was a setup where they
listened when little Comms. started
talking about interference in the internal
affairs of unions and took no notice of
interference in the internal affairs of
our union at Mount Tsa we should have
a look at the personnel of the Federal
Executive.”
It would seem as though Senator Ken-
nelly is not alone in wishing to bring
some of the things from under the carpet
that threaten to turn Labor into what
Senator Kennedy has described as “a per-
petual Opposition”.
BROKEN HILL
Knock on Churchill
“An anti-Australian"
BROKEN HILL Whereas the Sir
Winston Churchill Memorial Trust ap-
peal was a triumph throughout Austra-
lia, it became a political football in
unionised Broken Hill. The city’s
three most influential organisations, the
all-powerful Barrier Industrial Council,
Labor City Council and Barrier District
Assembly of the ALP, carried resolu-
tions of no support for the appeal. The
protagonists who pushed the resolu-
tions through branded Churchill as an
“anti-worker and anti-Australian”.
The City Council was the first to
oppose the appeal, making its decision
when Churchill was still alive, but for
political reasons the decision was kept
secret. When ALP leaders in Sydney
castigated the Labor aldermen behind
the scenes, the Mayor, Aid. G. L. Dial,
rushed to Press with a statement de-
claring “100 per cent support” for the
appeal and became the chairman of the
local appeal committee. He was later
to be rebuffed oTi the eve of the door-
knock when on a close vote aldermen
affirmed their opposition to the appeal.
The BDAALP also carried its “no
support'’ resolution by a close vote.
Fearful of the political repercussions,
the ALP hierarchy tried to keep the
decision quiet but the Press let the pro-
verbial cat out of the bag. In a quan-
dry, the BDAALP called a special meet-
ing to reconsider its attitude. However,
it failed to get a quorum. Thus the
president, Mr Arn Deuter, ruled that
officers and members of the ALP could
assist or contribute to the appeal if they
wished.
When the BIC decided against the
appeal, the appeal organisers were really
fearful. Under normal circumstances
it would have been the finish of the
appeal. But the president of the BIC,
Mr W. S. O'Neil, was persuaded to de-
clare that the BIC decision did not
mean that unionists were banned from
aiding or contributing to the appeal.
The RSL, organisers of the - appeal,
kept up a barrage of criticism of those
who opposed the appeal. No doubt
they were genuinely indignant and
ARN DEUTER
wanted Broken Hill to play its part in
such a worthwhile national project.
But underlying the whole affair was
concern that the local Labor opposi-
tion to the appeal would affect the
chances of the ALP candidate, Mr Lew
Johnstone, in the forthcoming State
elections. Mr Johnstone happens to be
president of the RSL. When D-Day
arrived, the organisers found that only
a handful of people were prepared to
act as collectors and subsequently only
£l6OO was collected.
Whilst the Independent Labor can-
didate for Cobar at the May 1 elections,
Aid. Doug McFarlane, was in Broken
Hill registering his vote against the ap-
peal, Mr Johnstone was at an out-of-
the-way outback settlement electioneer-
ing by helping to canvass funds for the
appeal. But all's well that ends well,
for the Broken Hill contribution eventu-
ally amounted to . £16,000, made up
mainly by generous donations from the
mining companies and other local con-
cerns.

Melbourne, a delegate described Aus-
tralians as “a sporting people” and
therefore urged that any proposal to

However, the State Council took a
rather unsporting attitude and decided
by 170 votes to 45 to abandon its policy

cision and risked the censure of non-
conformist Church leaders by adding
“my own views have always been in
favor of 10 o’clock closing”. Some of
these leaders feel that Mr Bolte has put
one over them. The Premier has said
many times that he would only change
the liquor laws in accordance with
Liberal Party policy, which insisted on
the referendum.
Leaders of the Presbyterian and Bap-
tist Churches, the Salvation Army and
the Church of Christ, took this to mean
that Mr Bolte would change hotel tra-
ding hours without the approval of a
referendum; they were confident that
they could still win any such vote. Now
that Liberal policy has changed, Mr
Bolte is free to act on what ever recom-
mendations are made by the Liquor
Royal Commissioner, Mr P. D. Phillips,
QC, whose report is due to be tabled
in Parliament in a few weeks.
Sporting men have made 10 o’clock
closing a firm favorite for being the
major recommendation in Mr Phillips’
report and sober Melbourne is likely
to get 10 o’clock closing in September.
EDUCATION
Primary Reform
NUAUS takes up the issue
MELBOURNE Teachers’ Unions
and Federations throughout Australia
have promised this year to campaign for
reforms in the training of primary
schoolteachers. Last month the National
LJnion of Australian University Students
also took up the issue and elaborated
detailed policies.
Some of its policies will be quickly
effected, particularly those concerning
entrance qualifications to teachers’
colleges and length of training. State
Education Department policies usually
work on endorsing accomplished facts,
so the first change will be the raisjng of
the entrance qualification to matricula-
tion. The extension of the period of
training from two to three years is also
likely to be made before 1970. Influential
college and department officials are work-
ing hard to get this extension before the
next population bulge rolls over the
primary schools.
These reforms, however, will be con-
sidered by most of the policy-makers to
be minor. Although NUAUS considers
three years’ training sufficient for a
primary teacher, the teachers unions and
most training authorities always plump
for four. For the unions there is the
powerful impetus of professional stand-
ing.
Although union campaigners in par-
ticular, and college authorities to some
extent, tread carefully to avoid offending
their colleagues, it is implicit in their
campgain that primary school-teachers
are under-educated. Teachers’ colleges
are very narrow institutions. They are
tightly controlled by the Education De-
partments, recruit staff of mediocre
academic qualifications from within de-
partmental ranks, and are oppressively
Public Service in atmosphere. With the
exception of Sydney Teachers’ College,
their courses are pedestrian and
utilitarian.
Whether courses would improve if
more time were given to them is
debatable. Any campaign to remove
the colleges from departmental control
or to improve their staffing is not likely
to succeed quickly. In spite of ATF
policy, which seeks independent control,
it is doubtful whether the major teachers’
unions would support much change.
Education Departments would certainly
be loath to give up control, because of
the dangers of higher standards affecting
teacher supply.
While shortages persist, other im-
portant issues in teacher training will
continue to be suppressed. Chief among
these is the recruiting device of obliging
trainees to serve out a bond. Every State
bonds its teachers, up to five years, and
demands sums large enough to ensure
that the bond is rarely broken. Education
departments are usually most self-satisfied
about the system, regarding it as slight
repayment for their generosity. How-
ever, the 1957 Murray Report on
tertiary education describes bonding as
“a bad system”, because it forces
students into a career before they have
experienced the studies which will prob-
ably decide their future.
The only possible effective counter to
bonded teacher scholarships are Com-
monwealth tertiary scholarships, but
they unfortunately are serving a steadily
diminishing proportion of university
students, at a time when they could well
be extended to tertiary education outside
the universities.
ARBITRATION
Wage Cases
Stumped
MELBOURNE The Arbitration
Commission's conception of its jurisdic-
tion in wage fixing was ruthlessly ex-
posed by the employers' counsel, Mr
James Robinson, first batsman up in the
total wage and basic wage cases now
being heard concurrently in Melbourne.
In his submission the main area of
wages play was in the “outer'’ and this
had to be brought into the Commis-
sion's field proper. He has yet to ex-
plain how a total wage would bring
about this result but, as the employers
told The Bulletin, Mr Robinson will
be at the crease indefinitely.
Even if the need somehow to recon-
cile wage determination in the open
market with the present restricted area
in which the Commission is obliged by
statute to operate is recognised, Mr
Robinson did not seem to be doing the
total wage cause much good by abusing
the Commission on inadvertent results
from judgments it brought down six
years ago. These, said Mr Robinson,
Tiad the effect of encouraging the unions
to bid up the supply price of labor in
the open market.
Maybe, as he said, the Commission
did inadvertently “dangle the carrot” of
over-award payments as a result of these
judgments but it is mighty difficult to
disentangle cause and effect in thfe open
market operations of employees in the

last few years, particularly in the full
employment conditions of the last year
or more.
Many employers will freely admit
that, to get all the labor they need in the
highly competitive conditions of the
market, they have thrown quite a few
hostages to the process of wages drift
themselves. This, of course, is not to
say that wage-earners have spurned
their own opportunities. Nor should
the Commission necessarily be blamed
for the result.
In last year’s total and basic wages
proceedings at the Commission the
employers threw everything into their
submissions. They appear to be off on
the same time-wasting tack again,
taking an unnecessarily abusive line,
seemingly having learned no lessons
from their failure to convince the Com-
mission a year ago.
It is fair enough for them to attack
last year's increase in the basic wage
according to their total wage and pro-
ductivity lights, and perhaps even to
criticise the Commission for being a
bit mixed up in its interpretation of.
capacity to pay. But even these seem
a bit remote from the main issue. To
drive home the case for a total wage it
would be wiser for the employers to
stick to carefully reasoned and if pos-
sible unbiased arguments.
J. C. HORSFALL
LAW
The Ass?
Perth's murderers
PERTH That the law can seem
an ass was seldom more true than in
the case last week of 16-year-old
Thomas Trantum who was found guilty
here of having wilfully murdered a
woman he claimed did not like him
and was sentenced to hang. He was
then whisked off to the permanently lit
death cell at Fremantle Gaol with no
privacy from the 24-hour guard at his
door. The rather absurd part is that
everyone (including, no doubt, Trantum
himself) knows he will not be hanged,
but no one can say so officially. The
judge merely passed the mandatory
death sentence, though he did not don
the traditional black cap.
Few would deny that Trantum’s crime
was a vicious one that showed highly
dangerous psychopathic tendencies. He
shot his employer’s wife three times
through the head with a rifle he had
to reload each time, and then tried to
fake a robbery scene.


But his present predicament shows
how long overdue reforms are in capital
cases in Western Australia, apart from
that matter of the gallows. A suggestion
that convicted killers be remanded for
sentence during the appeal period and
until the Government considered the
case (which it must do anyway) was
supported by WA University reader in
law, Dr E. J. Edwards. However, the
idea was attacked by Law Society pre-
sident J. M. Lavan and Professor E. K.
Braybrooke, professor of jurisprudence
at the University.
Meanwhile, another chapter is about to
be added to the strange case of Darryl
Beamish, also sentenced for murder. A
deaf mute, he found vociferous cham-
pions of his alleged innocence in the
State ALP, which included a fresh trial
for him in its list of election promises.
This was despite the fact that Beamish
had already (since his 1961 conviction
for the 1959 murder of socialite Jillian
Brewer) failed to win any of two
appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal
or two to the High Court of Australia.
Two Labor bids in the WA Parlia-
ment to secure him a new trial with a
special bid were also thrown out. Since
Labor’s convincing defeat in the State
election, Premier Brand has announced
that his Government will give financial
help for an appeal to the Privy Council,
in line with its undertaking to give ad
reasonable assistance to Beamish. This
seems more sensible than to usurp the
decisions of the courts.
POLITICS
The May Day Election
In the spirit of ’65
SYDNEY As the Liberal and
Country Party Opposition campaign to
unseat the NSW State Labor Govern-
ment got under way for the eighth time
■-since 1941, the electioneering slogans
may have sounded very much the same
as three years ago: “Our united front
will follow exactly the pattern of the
Liberal-Country Party coalition which
has ruled in Canberra longer than any
other government” . . . “The Menzies-
McEwen Government has brought
greater progress and prosperity to Aus-
tralia than any other government” . . .
“The Askin-Cutler combination will do
the same thing for NSW” . . .
But the spirit of ’65 was not that of
’62. In that year of “credit squeeze”
and reaction against the Federal
Government the State Opposition parties
were less than happy at being so closely
identified with Canberra. On May 1
they will be more than happy to be
very closely identified.
In 1962 the NSW State election fol-
lowed a Federal swing to Labor at the
end of 1961. This year the State pod
comes not only after the loss of six
NSW Labor seats in the House of
Representatives’ election at the end of
1963 but the crippling defeat of the
Labor Party in NSW in the Senate elec-
tion three months ago. The NSW
Senate swing to the Liberal-Country
Party in 1964 was an increase of almost
3 per cent on the 1963 results. Senior
ALP officials agreed after the Senate
election that the results could not have
portended worse for Labor’s future
prospects in NSW.
Not only will the Opposition be work-
ing hard to present their leader, Mr
Rr- W. Askin, as a Macquarie Street
edition of Sir Robert Menzies but they
will be just as eager to link the Premier,
Mr J. B. Renshaw, with Mr Arthur Cal-
well, leader of “the discredited and re-
jected Calwell Opposition” according to
some election pamphlets.
There is no doubt that one of the
reasons for Labor's longevity in NSW
has been its ability to present itself as
Right wing, solid, respectable, and free
R. W. ASKIN
from the kind of State executive which
has bedevilled the Labor Party's chances
in States like Victoria or Western Aus-
tralia.
The Opposition parties hope they can
use recent events like the participation
in the 1964 Peace Congress, the nomi-
nation of Mr Les Haylen for the Senate
ticket and the failure of Mr Renshaw
to commit himself on Senator Kennedy's
proposals for unity with the DLP (in
contrast to WA's Mr Hawke) to show
that the NSW Party is moving to the
Left.
In this attempt to weaken the Right-
wing image of the NSW Labor Party
they may get direct help from the
division caused by ALP Left-wingers
who are pressing for the censure of
Senator Kennedy. The disclosure of a
basic split so close to the election will
be exploited by the Opposition, and
especially by Sir Robert Menzies.
Mr Renshaw, on the other hand, will
fight the election only on State issues
emphasising the Government’s record of
expansion, sound financial management,
and the something-for-everybody ap-
proach of a Government which, against
all the paper calculations and despite
the closeness of some of its victories,
has stayed in power. In the retiring
Parliament the ALP had 53 seats, the
Liberals 26, the Country Party 14 and
there was one Independent. In public
Mr Rensha\v has tried to remain un-
impressed by the “swing to the Liber-
als”.
In private Mr Renshaw, even if he
really believes that only State issues
decide the result, must be pondering
the reasons for the Opposition's confi-
dence. For holding the elections on
May 1, the penultimate date, looked
very much like trying to buy time.
At the State by-elections of 1964 in
Wollongong-Kembla, Waratah, and
Lakemba the ALP vote dropped by 8
per cent, 4.4 per cent and 6.9 per cent
from its 1962 poll. To win power the
Opposition needs a swing of only 3 per
cent. In the metropolitan area its best
prospects lie in winning back Coogee
and Nepean, lost in 1962, and gaining
Bligh, Drummoyne, and Sutherland.
In Bligh, which includes the working
class suburb of Paddington as well as
the upper-class suburbs of Double Bay
and EdgecliflF, Mr Mort Cohen, a public
will need a swing of 1.3
per cent to defeat Mr Tom Morey, a
former waterfront tally clerk who won
the seat for the ALP in 1962 with an
absolute majority of 76.
In Sutherland, where a swing of 5.4
per cent is needed, Alderman K. Bates,
an Independent Liberal who gave his
preference votes to the Labor MLA
Mr T. Dalton in 1962 after he had
failed to get official endorsement, is not
standing and is campaigning for the
endorsed Liberal candidate. Together
with the hoped-for general swing, Liber-
al Party officials believe this will win the
seat.
In the country the Opposition is con-
fident of winning Goulburn, where Mr
L. J. Tully, whose family has held the
seat for two generations, is retiring;
Murrumbidgee, where the Minister for
Agriculture, Mr E. G. Enticknap, is re-
tiring; and Monaro, where Labor MLA
Mr J. Seifert died recently. It thinks
it has a very good chance in Wyong,
Hartley, and Wollongong - Kembla.
There is even optimistic talk of unseat-
ing Mr Renshaw in Castlereagh, where
a swing of 3.5 per cent would give the
seat to the Opposition.
The Labor Party believes it can gain
Gosford and Dubbo, with Tenterfield
and Tamworth as possibilities. The

Liberals point out that the Labor
Government is unpopular in Dubbo be-
cause of the airlines dispute which has
denied Dubbo direct service to Sydney,
and that a general swing to them would
give them all their present seats with
an increased majority. They believe
that on the main State issues the
Government is vulnerable on its mis-
handling of small shopkeepers, rent
policy, transport and housing.
In their own Party the Liberals are
trying hard to get campaign workers to
realise what they regard as self-evident
truths: that NSW is not a Labor State;
that except for 1962 the non-Labor
parties have polled a majority of votes
since 1950; that electoral boundaries
and the disfranchised postal voters
have kept the Party out of power; and
that, above all, the swing is to them in
’65.
The imponderables of the State elec-
tion lie ahead—the television personali-
ties and leadership qualities of Mr
Renshaw and Mr Askin, both still rela-
tively unknown quantities, the effects of
the Maher case on public opinion, the
possibility that Mr Renshaw may return
triumphant from Canberra if there is a
Premiers’ Loan Conference before the
election, and the real degree of co-
operation that will exist between the
Liberal and Country Parties.
WA ELECTION
A New Forrest
For the vanquished
soul searching
PERTH Western Australia’s Pre-
mier Mr David Brand has become the
first man since Lord Forrest to lead the
State for three consecutive terms, while
Labor's stocks in the Lower House
have fallen to their lowest point in
40 years. Meanwhile, for the first
time in many years a Government
has a safe majority in both Houses
—2O to 10 in Council, against
17 to 13 in the old Parliament, and 29
to 21 in the Assembly against 26 to 24.
For the Liberal-Country Party coali-
tion it is a clear mandate to go
ahead on what obviously will be a
time of change and expansion. For
the vanquished there is already a
great deal of soul searching. The
Opposition Leader, Mr Bert Hawke,
this week stood before the State ALP
executive to explain his pre-election
statement favoring Senator Kennelly’s
ALP-DLP reconciliation proposals. The
Labor Leader, who has retained a good
public image over the years, said wearily
on election night that he may retire at
the end of this year. In these circum-
stances he could well throw down the
gauntlet before the State Secretary, Joe
Chamberlain, calling in his forthright
way for a major shakeout of the State's
rickety Labor machine. If he refused to
toe the line, the lack of a worthy
successor would gain strength for his
viewpoint.
The Deputy Leader, Mr John Tonkin,
is allied to too many ratbag causes —
bookies, anti-fluoridation and champion-
ing chiropractors and the other most
logical successor, Mr Herbie Graham, is
probably too . v and old hat to win the
younger electors that Labor is so obvi-
ously losing.
In the context the Brand Government’s
win could be classed as a landslide.
SWIMMING
Tin Gods
“The faceless six ”
SYDNEY Sooner or later one of
Australia’s amateur sports associations
was bound to reach an extreme in
attempts by officials to prove that all
power of thought and decision is vested
in them. Now that public reaction to
the Australian Swimming Union’s ex-
pulsion of four women swimmers has
exploded over the responsible commit-
tee’s heads (if “responsible” is the right
word for the six faceless men who met
in Hobart) the lesson should be clear
to officials of all the amateur sports.
They may believe that they are the
sport; the public sees it otherwise.
A sport can exist without officials,
but not without active competitors. And
even more fundamentally a sport's
health, its power to attract and hold a
strong reserve of young people and a
sufficient number of followers who pay
at the gate, depends very largely on its
current supply of heroes. This must
seem an impossible thing to the officials
of several amateur sports. Elected to
administer, they seek to control, making
rules which are wonderfully logical to
their minds and ridiculously illogical to
the younger competitors.
This was the effect of the ASU’s ac-
tion, banishment from all competitive
swimming, from club level up, for
three, four, and for Dawn Fraser a
merciful 10 years instead of life, allow-
ing her. to return to swimming in her
late 30s. How fatuous could six men
be? The women’s swimming associations
should be restored, and the mainspring
of the sport, the swimmers, should be
well represented on all committees. The
establishment in amateur swimming has
made it clear that independent minds are
the last thing it wants and that complete
subservience (don't think, obey) is the
first requirement. If disobedience was not
the only crime of those expelled, if their
misbehavior was more serious, then the
ASU would stand condemned for not
suspending them on the spot, in Tokyo,
before they competed.

ON THE MARGIN
A Bookworm’s World of Flavor
athletic young people who adver-
tise cigarettes and other articles on
television are causing some unexpected
reactions from over-40 viewers. A case
I have in mind is Mr Henry Seatwell, a
Sydney librarian.
As he has been a cigarette smoker
for many years, I was surprised to
notice he had switched to a pipe.
Questioned about it, he replied: “I de-
cided I was too old for cigarettes.” He
came to this conclusion after watching
TV commercials.
“They emphasise that cigarettes are
suitable for youths and girls of the
active, outdoor type,” he told me
despondently. “The smokers are all
racing motorists, high divers, water-
skiers—and their female companions, of
course. When they’re not engaged in
strenuous sports, these dashing young
people are boarding aeroplanes for
foreign parts.”
“I can’t see how that affects you," I
said.
“Well, I don't do any of
those things. I began to
wonder: what right have I
to smoke cigarettes? Like a
fool, I set out to prove to
myself I was worthy of
king-size filter-tips. I tried
high diving, but I only land-
ed on my stomach. 1 had a go at water-
skiing, and I nearly drowned myself. I
just had to accept the fact that I’m not
young and fit enough for cigarette-
smoking.”
A similar feeling of inferiority made
Mrs Agnes Jawford, of our district —a
woman in her fifties—stop eating choco-
lates.
“On TV,” she told me, “I kept seeing
debonair young men giving chocolates
to pretty girls. Naturally I came to
connect assorted centres with romance,
courtship, and—let’s be frank—seduc-
tion. Every night I watched these
glamorous creatures, their eyes full of
desire, sharing a Yummo Bar or a box
of Superchox—like Tristan and Isolde
tossing off a love potion.
“For a grandmother like me to be
chewing Superchox—somehow it seem-
ed wrong. No Prince Charming is likely
to nuzzle me and whisper: ‘The flavor
is different .’ I said to myself: ‘Who
are you kidding?’ And I gave up
chocolates for good.”
Some viewers are openly critical of
the gay personnel of the commercials.
An accountant said to me: “God, I’m
tired of these water-skiers and their nit-
wit girl-friends. They talk about
nothing but cigarettes, chocolates, and
shampoos.”
However, there are changes afoot.
Shrewd advertising men know that a
big public is waiting for commercials
aimed at the more mature, less nimble
age-groups. Mr Derek Smarter, the
account executive who handles Gasp-
master cigarettes, was one of the first
to sense the trend. He gave me a pre-
view of a series of commercials that
will soon hit the screens.
“We’re leading off the campaign with
this one,” he said. “It should be a
winner.”
A sequence of camera shots showed
scenes in districts of Melbourne and
Sydney. There were quick glimpses of
a shopping centre in Prahran, a side
street in Ashfield, a baby health centre
in Northcote, a backyard in Hurstville.
At the same time a voice intoned:
“Wherever life is average, humdrum,
suburban—people prefer Gaspmasters!”
Mr Smarter murmured:
“Bags of viewer identifica-
tion there, I think.”
In another commercial a
series of men and women
were seen sitting in chairs.
An auditor frowned over a
ledger; a teacher corrected
a pile of exam, papers; a journalist tap-
ped a typewriter. The background voice
proclaimed: “In today’s harassed, indoor,
sedentary world —Gaspmasters make
life more bearable.”
“The next one is meant to appeal to
the higher-IQ groups,” Mr Smarter ex-
plained.
A man of about 35, thin and spec-
tacled, was reading a book. As he put
it down, one could see the title: No
Exit, by Jean-Paul Sartre. He looked
through the window at the rain, slowly
pulled out a packet of cigarettes. The
voice said: “Where there's an introvert,
there’s a Gaspmaster!”
To me, the most appealing of the
new commercials was one which simply
depicted a middle-aged man lying on a
couch. The voice asked: “Why are so
many inactive people turning to Gasp-
masters?” The man on the couch
lowered the newspaper he was holding,
yawned, and began to sing: “It's Gasp-
masters for inertia —Gaspmasters for
me!”
Mr Smarter told me he had also lined
up some homely housewives to do ads
for chocolates and shampoos. The word
in the industry is that water-skiers are on
the skids.

The Harder They Fall
“Please don’t call them disc jockeys"
By CHARLES HIGHAM
you must not” the instruction
was repeated firmly by execu-
tives each time I visited a radio
station during the past month—“call
them disc jockeys.” The term, with its
connotations of fast-talking salesman-
ship, possible payola and a relentlessly
commercial attitude to music, is now
definitely taboo, at least in Sydney radio
stations. “Announcer” is now the
accepted term; it apparently gives the
disc jockey dignity, anonymity in most
cases, and perhaps allows him to be
more easily fitted into the smooth pat-
tern of a station’s operation, to be less
a personality, an egotist. And, in fact,
the old hard-core DJ, dynamic, slick,
pushing records with a brisk combina-
tion of sales patter and know-how
about the charts, seems temporarily out
of favor in radio. If the managers of
some stations had their way, DJs would
simply be representatives of a station s
image, salesmen-announcers whose tern-
peraments would be severely tailored to
what their bosses needed at a particular
time.
Clashes between DJs and station
managers have been notorious and fre-
quent. A station boss will fly to
America, pick up some gimmick,
change the station’s policy to fit it, and
tame his DJs accordingly. Inevitably,
resignations follow. One minute a
John Laws will be playing, hard and
fast, the Top 40, making predictions,
setting public taste, and the next will be
a more or less obedient purveyor of
“quality” music—middle -of - the - road
pops and jazz, with an eye fixed firmly
on the young adult market, or the
middle-aged and old. A teenage idol
can suddenly become a friend to the
mums and dads, or a sober, middle-
brow disc jockey can be asked to whip
off his tie, don white jeans, grow his
hair long, dye it with Ajax, and bang
away hard at the kind of things surfies
listen to between waves.
Sometimes, with spectacular com-
plaints against his bosses splashed over
newspapers, a DJ can resign, make a
sudden switch, and possibly after
weeks of negotiations with a rival sta-
tion—start up again elsewhere. Most
of the major DJs have done this. The
moves often result in increased money
and perhaps more prestige. Their
former station hires some new persona-
lity to replace them, builds their per-
sonality high, and the pattern is re-
peated.
Most DJs are engaged after making
their mark in a country station. They
submit a tape and are called in for an
interview. When hired, most are lucky
to climb even as high as £SO a week.
Only a few dynamos make the big time:
£IOO-£250 a week for these is not un-
common, and the reason for paying
such huge sums lie's in the ratings they
can command, their infallibility as sales-
men of a product. Knowledge of popu-
lar music seems to be less and less
essential, the programmes more and
more frequently selected for them by
the studio bosses.
What does a station look for in a DJ?
Ken Taylor, manager of 2GB, explained
in terms echoed by many of his col-
leagues: “We look for a cultured voice,
but not a pseudo-English voice or the
obvious result of an elocution class. We
look for the warmth of a sincere per-
sonality. We don't want just sweetness
and light, but a bit of the devil as well,
We want a little touch of the unpredict-
able—and we don’t mean incorrigible,
We want to ensure that a personality
can P ro i ect itself through a microphone,
h° w s * s done is hard to define,
an elusive something ! But perhaps it
is partly an ability to see beyond the
microphone to the great listening audi-
ences out there.
“Each part of our radio day divides
up into different audience appeal areas
into which an announcer must fit. For
instance, the early morning breakfast
session is for all age groups; from then
up to lunchtime women are the chief
listeners. At midday, you have a high
proportion of male listeners coming
home for ,unch in the suburbs. In the
afternoon you have women again, in the
* ate afternoon young people and busi-
nessmen returning home, in the evening
the whole family. On Sunday, o
course, you have a very wide audience
and m the th< - beach and cav
audiences. We have also experimen e
successfully with women announcers on
the midnight to dawn programme. e
have learned that intersta.e nigu rue
drivers do not listen to any ot ler
station.
“The image at our station is now one
of quality. We insist on high grade
music and this has made us, in the last
six months, for the first time the top-


rating station. We have to work con-
stantly to keep abreast with the latest
in music. An announcer has to ‘live’
his announcing and believe in it and we
have to keep an eye on any possible
faults in the records he plays. For in-
stance, a recent recording of ‘Ma, he’s
making eyes at me’ had to be dropped
because of a certain case in the courts.
There are just so many loophples! We
keep a sound-scriber of broadcasts —a
sustained tape giving many hours of
listening—and we constantly monitor
individual programmes. This means
that faults can be corrected in confer-
ence with the announcers later.
“An announcer has to familiarise
himself with every aspect of a sponsor’s
product. If he were selling sportswear,
he would have to go down to a shop
and examine the whole range of items.
For instance, since most women want
to know what men would like them to
wear, an announcer has the advantage
of giving male views to a female audi-
ence. There are some restrictions on
commercials, of course. We would not
advertise certain brands of patent
medicines. Or alcohol on a programme
when young people were listening, or on
Sunday.”
The Good Guys
Tn Sydney, 2SM has established a
A stable of DJs known as “The Good
Guys”. The term came from America,
where 2SM executive Bill Stephenson
goes from time to time to study trends.
In the smoothly-furnished lobby of the
station, glossy photographs of the Good
Guys gaze down at the visitor from
the walls: cheerful faces twisted into
broad, boyish grins, with cropped hair
and a look of well-fed, clean-living,
clean-cut decency. “We look for
brightness, sincerity and happiness in
our prospective Good Guys,” Mr
Stephenson—in his thickly-curtained
office with its pastel colors and airless
atmosphere of luxury—told me.
“The person we select must have a
good standing in his own circle and
must be a good guy in every sense.
Not just good in the sense of being a
good announcer with a good voice, but
good in his manner of life. This is
essential if he is going to appeal to
young people. He has to have a
brightness, a happiness and creativity in
his work. For instance, our breakfast
show announcer, Phil Halverson, has a
bright, happy voice and a natural wit.
He puts bits of humor in his pro-
gramme.”
In another office in the studio rabbit-
warren, Mike Walsh, the most success-
ful and celebrated of 2SM's Good Guys,
sketched in his background. He began
on a station at Shepparton, Victoria,
doing general announcing, “jolly things
like funerals”. He also dabbled in
theatre. “I wanted to be an amusing,
likeable personality. I was trained by
Lee Murray at his well-known school
of announcing. We would just sit
around a table with him and would get
up at the end of several hours wonder-
ing what had happened. The technique
was to get us to talk naturally and
freely. This was to help the inhibited
artists. I joined 3XY in Melbourne
and obtained a show from 4.30 to 7.30
p.m. This wound up with a ‘Jazz As
You Like It’ programme.
“In Sydney, 2SM offered me a job
and I was given the night session when
television was at its height. This was
an important challenge. I began an
organisation called Televiewers Anony-
mous. Just like Alcoholics Anonymous,
you know. Members promised to keep
away from their TV sets. I encouraged
the idea that little Fred and his radio
were standing up against big TV Goli-
ath. People love Don Quixotes.
“Within six months the rating for
that time-slot had been built from
nothing to nine. This was the highest
rating since the heyday of Jack Davey.
“I also started up a campaign to
stamp out plastic flowers. This was
supposed to help struggling gardeners.
And there were satirical interviews. We
had a ‘Being Kind to Beetroot’ cam-
paign. We pointed out that beetroot
was an unloved fruit and that many
people thought its only property was
that it stained tablecloths.
“We also had a gumleaves cam-
paign for Australia Day. We called for
a gumleaf player. And a competition
for singing dogs. Most of the dogs re-
fused to sing on microphone, but we did
finally get one to go through with a
number. There was also a competition
promoting a cure for teenage pimples,
for a bird to sing the Pimplex song.
One memorable afternoon people
brought in galahs and parrots and tried
to coax them to sing the song. Finally,
we did succeed in persuading a budgie
to do it, but after going well at the audi-
tion it unfortunately bombed on mike.
“We also have an international bath
night in collaboration with an American
station in which we expect listeners to
take a bath. The programme is intro-
duced with bath noises, you know,
water running down a drain, and so on.
And things like interviews with Rin
Tin Tin, who declares in dog language
that he is going to change to a Scottish
subject because he is madly in love with
Lassie.”
Mr Walsh played me a lengthy taped
excerpt from a programme honoring
Mozart’s birthday, in which he did a
satirical send-up of the composer’s life
in a fake middle-European accent. As
we left the studio he was greeted by
ecstatic teenage fans who, with great
ceremony, solemnly presented him with
a large can of beetroot.
The Ward Austin Story
Otill more famous, Ward Austin of
2UW is Mike Walsh’s biggest Syd-
ney rival as a DJ. Blond, crumple-faced
Austin, who wore a pink, short-sleeved
shirt, a pale beige cardigan, white
casual trousers and moccasins for the
interview, was schooled at Riverview,
sold musical instruments, went to
Canada where he worked as an assistant
to a designer and on the box cars on
the Canadian Pacific Railway, and, in
Los Angeles, worked for the May Com-
pany, managing a floor-covering divi-
sion. He returned to Australia at 23,
spent three years with Fortuna Fabrics
as a commercial traveller, then decided
to fulfil “a long felt need" to go into
radio. He wrote to Howard Craven of
2UW and Craven referred him to Eric
Wright at 2KY who was then running
a small radio announcers’ school. “We
would spend six weeks on one poem at
the school,” said Austin. “Just a little
verse, but it had to have exactly the
right feeling and inflection in it. We
then had to learn how to project our
voices and read scripts of many differ-
ent kinds. After six months I was ready.
I sent audition tapes round and after two
months 2KA at Katoomba hired me. I
did everything—announcing, panel opera-
ting—even went down to Springwood
to talk to the local butcher, hairdresser
and newsagent, suggesting they buy seg-
ments to make up a Springwood hour.
“I started the programme ‘Swing and
Sway'; I went down to the Lithgow
paper with some negatives of shots of
myself and these were published. They
added considerably to my image. I then
went to 2UE,-which was the top station
at the time —Tony Withers left and I
got the top slot.
“I was offered good money to go to
2GB and built a big teenage following
there, but the studio changed its image
to a ‘quality’ image and I felt that was
not my kind of thing.
“After considering offers from 2SM
and 2UW, I decided on 2UW. It’s a
go-go-go station with a new, teenage
swinging image. Kids with transistors on
the beach like it and I have formed a
‘Listen to Ward Austin Coming Home
from School' Club. The names of mem-
bers are put in a barrel and drawn every
Friday and the winner comes on the
show on Saturday to help compere it.
With their friends at school the winners
choose the eight most popular numbers
in their group and these eight records
are played.
“I talk rapidly and happily and put in
bits about my private life. For instance,
if I am stung by a wasp, I will tell them

The Fallen Idols
lyjß Austin sees his future as an an-
nouncer extending until he is 40.,
when he thinks he will no longer be able
to hold his audience. He has to aet like
a 22-23-year-old and use what he calls
“gas, fab language”. He has bought a
house in Pvmble which he plans to stock
with colonial furniture, runs a Triumph
Spitfire, is about to buy a yacht, plans to
go into investments later, has 1045
records, a wardrobe of casual clothes, a
square-cut signet ring and a constant eye
on the charts.
With Walsh and Austin riding the wave
of success, the two' idols of yesteryear,
John Laws and Bob Rogers, seem to
have lost something of their glitter. Bob
Rogers now fits smoothly into the atmos-
phere of 2UE, while John Laws is a

for saying this, but I’m far from happy,”
Laws told me (he represents the so-called
“rebellious” school of DJs whose
“taming” by 2GB has caused some fric-
tion in the station).
“When the station image changed in
June of last year, I was no longer per-
mitted to be completely free in my pro-
grammes,” he said. “There was a syste-
matic removal of my old image. In this
cupboard you see tapes and effects re-
cords I brought back with me from a
month in America; no use has been made
of these. It is very damaging to my ego
to find that I am not consulted at all in
the programme and that all records are
selected for me.
“I would like to get together with
Dita Cobb to do a programme and Dita
would like to get together with me, but
we are not allowed to. I did a Friday

a disappointment to myself. I am not
promoted and I feel that my potential
is being wasted. I don’t let them walk
over me. I’d rather go tomorrow and
walk into David Jones and sell neck-
ties than let them trample on me. But
I’m not free.”
At 2KY and 2CH there is equally
little encouragement of the “personality”
disc jockey. 2CH's executives shuddered
when I 'mentioned the forbidden term.
They believe in engaging all-round an-
nouncers with educated voices who can
handle a variety of assignments (and
would welcome graduates if they could
get them).
In Melbourne, DJs appear to have a
rather freer run than they do in Sydney.
Don Lunn at 3UZ plays a toy trumpet,
makes quips that he calls Lunny-
Funnies, talks with a mythical character
called Moon Doggie and, his fanship
unhindered by the fact that he has a
wife and five children, is in the Mel-
bourne DJ top income bracket of £ 100-
plus a week.
Grantley Dee at 3AK jockeys his discs
with such near-hysteric enthusiasm that
listeners could mistakenly believe his
studio was on fire. He is 19, has been
a leader in the field three years and is
totally blind. Sick jokes about him are
frequent, e.g., that he isn't really blind,
but his seeing-eye dog is and he has to
lead it around.
3KZ's Keith Livingstone flourishes the
predictable nickname of “Doc”. Barry
Ferber, doing summer broadcasts for
3DB from a round of swimming pools, is
promoted in the language of the cult
as “Ferber Goes Poolside”.
In Adelaide the best-known DJs are
Graeme Edwin, a New Zealander with an
unusual style; Stuart Jay, formerly with
2WG Wagga, a general announcer with
2SM Sydney and DJ with 3UZ, Mel-
bourne; and Jim Siade, a former police
officer who had basic training in the
radio room at police headquarters, then
joined DN as a presentation officer.
What is" the future of disc jockeys?
The indications are that some stations,
harassed by the problems created by
temperamental personalities, will in-
creasingly discourage the kind of star
system whereby a man can twist a studio
round his finger, making it work for him
rather than the other way round, playing
one station against another, upstaging
competitors on the same network. Most
of the station managers 1 spoke to seemed
to have “had” the old-fashioned, high-
powered DJ with his temperament and
his hordes of fans. But the fact remains
that these stations which hope to hold
the top ratings in the future are going to
have to put up with the new DJ stars
as they come along, temperaments, im-
possible salaries and all. For the pub-
lic want stars, and the sponsor wants
salesmen whose words are' law. Until
that changes, the DJ’s future—given
sufficient shrewdness, toughness and the
extrovert personality so essential in the
business —could be bright. But it re-
mains to be seen whether, in this awk-
ward period, he can keep his end up
against those studio bosses who are deter-
mined to bring him more and more
obediently to heel.

Peter O’Shaughnessy: Who’s He?
Horses for courses at the Independent
By DENIS O’BRIEN
A fellow who probably worked for
Harry Wren said that putting on
a one-man play called “The Diary
of a Madman” at Sydney’s Independent
Theatre sounded like horses for courses.
Peter O’Shaughnessy absorbed the
remark, gave it a grudging smile and
quickly slipped back behind his Press
conference face: shaggy eyebrows ever-
ready to rise, nostrils inclined to flare
at the slightest sniff of irrelevance.
This is no Richard Burton willing to
stream out trivia, nor is it a Gielgud
anxious to gossip.about “Variety” filler
pars one minute and opinionate about 400
years of Shakespeare the next. This is
no-nonsense Peter O’Shaughnessy, actor,
producer, manager, playwright, adapter,
reluctant public figure, occasional ex-
patriate Australian and the one-man
everything of “The Diary of a Madman”.
O’Shaughnessy’s adaptation of Gogol’s
tragi-comic short story and his produc-
tion and performance of it at the Perth
Festival in January and in Sydney cur-
rently, is the Australian theatre’s first
substantial talking point of the year. In
prospect it did sound a formidably
intimidating entertainment for the
cavernous gloom of the Independent, and
it required some uncharacteristically
animated PR work by the Arts Council
and the Trust (who jointly imported it
from Perth) to give it an appealing
promise.
This involved O’Shaughnessy himself
in a busy round of interviews, work for
which he confesses a vague distaste. “The
fact that the theatre does need the Press
so badly is painful to me, but I have to
face it,” he said.
The Arts Council handout ushered
him into Sydney as “sharing with John
Alden (who died recently, the reputation
of being Australia’s outstanding classical
actor”. It was a claim both facile and
difficult to dispute.
It had been almost seven years since
O’Shaughnessy had performed in Sydney
and outside his coterie of admirers he
seemed unknown or forgotten. He had
spent a considerable amount of the time
overseas and little of what he’d done had
been reported back here. In those seven
years Australians had come to know
Ron Haddrick, John Bell and Reg Liver-
more and had been kept fully cabled on
the activities of Rod Taylor, Peter Finch
and Ron Randell.
Peter O’Shaughnessy: Who’s he? Or:
I thought he’d gone to live in America.
“I am not particularly worried that I
may not be widely known in Australia,”
he says. “I don’t mean that to sound
pompous. It is just that I am not
dedicated to the idea of self-promotion
above the satisfaction ! get from the sort
of theatre I play.
“I am reasonably satisfied with the
response to what I’ve been doing in
Britain and Ireland and . . . well, I"m
probably better known in Melbourne
than Sydney. Melbourne is where I was
born and where' most of my work in
Australia has originated.”
He emerged notably in Melbourne
around 1947 in a repertory theatre per-
formance as Othello, and by 1954 he was
Hamlet in his own “neo-Elizabethan”
production of the play at the Nicholas
Hall. He did a reportedly impressive
King Lear at Melbourne’s Arrow Theatre
in 1957, and with a Macbeth now under
his belt he has played all four of Shake-
speare’s great tragic roles and 25 or
so others as well.
The “commercial” theatre, he says,
offers him little that he finds enticing,
and if the “classical” theatre is tempor-
arily out of parts for him he usually
turns to and writes, borrows or adapts
and produces himself.
This has led him to an intriguingly
varied range of entertainment: from
Beckett (“Waiting for Godot”) whom he
admires and vigorously supports, to
Barry Humphries whom he counts
among a small circle of close friends
and whom he produced in a 1958 Mel-
bourne revue, wherein Sandy Stone was
born; from a pioneering Lunch-Hour
Theatre in Victoria (years before the
Trust thought of the idea) to the verse
of C. J. Dennis, which he helped re-
popularise with a music-hall monologue
recital on a LP record which has sold
more than 10,000 copies.
Also to “The Diary of a Madman”
which he first put on show in Dublin last
year.
“As soon as I read the story I saw its
possibilities for the theatre,” he said. “I
set to work and adapted it—and when
I’d finished it i heard Paul Scofield read-
ing another adaptation on BBC radio, so
I can’t say it was an entirely original
idea, although I had completed mine
before I heard Scofield’s.
“In fact, since then the actor Richard
Harris has presented an adaptation on
the London stage (it wasn’t a success),
somebody called Roger something-or-
other has done an adaptation in Paris
and a cartoon film of it is being made in
Canada. It has very interesting possi-
bilities for the cinema.
“I like it because it has richness. The
dramatic shape is already in the text. It
satisfies and encompasses the different
poles of Brecht and Beckett in that it
shows some of the Brecftian patterns of
external and environmental forces gov-
erning behavior and, like Beckett, takes
us deeper into what Peter Coleman once
said was ‘the human predicament and all
that jazz’.”
Coleman wrote that about O’Shaugh-
nessy’s production of “Waiting for
Godot” at the Independent seven years
ago when the bizarre Beckett play was
first confusing and illuminating the inter-
national theatre.
O’Shaughnessy admired the play then
and admires it still and recently wrote to
Samuel Beckett to discuss a possible
O’Shaughnessy revival of it. He thinks
that there is now a much greater under-
standing of the play, although he him-
self never had any doubts about it. “It
has a specific reality to the Irish,” he
says.
O’Shaughnessy has spent half the last
15 years overseas and thinks he will
return there again before this year is
over. He has no desire to be trapped in
what he terms “the London scrum” but
he senses deeper satisfactions, greater
opportunities abroad. “I am not keen
to make an extended tour with ‘Mad-
man’, it really is a strenuous role. For
instance, 1 don't think I want to tour it
in the country as I’ve been asked to do
by the Arts Council. The setting up and
preparation of it is too involved for a
one- or two-night stand. But it is paying

A SET
OF CINTURATOS *
IS AS GOOD
AS AN ENGINE
TUNE
Town or Country , . .
Cinturato tyres stay with
longer than conventional tyres.
They run cooler, generate less
heat at high speeds and
disperse heat more easily. Less
heat, less wasted engine power
mean economies in fuel con-
sumption.
Cinturato drivers marry safety-
first with safety-fast because
Cinturatos absorb less power,
turn the car into a manageable
motor. These tyres don’t play
fast and loose; you can take
the bend ahead with the con-
fidence of a train driver glued
to the rails. The grip is superb
because the tread is always
open to engage the road, wet
or dry.
High performance, maximum
efficiency, he travels fastest,
safest and surest who travels
by Cinturato. If you’re still
waiting to try this fabulous

about my needing the money. My work
hasn't made me rich, and I have debts.”
Also a wife (an actress with whom he
has frequently appeared in his own pro-
ductions) and two young children.
At 41, after a career which has earned
him a solidly moderate prestige,
O’Shaughnessy seems to be burning his
fires for play-by-play achievement more
than for intangible ambitions. A shamb-
ling, roughly-hewn fellow, he appears
studiously unimpressed even by his
relative successes. And one feels that
when he next illuminates the scene (in
another seven years ?) he will have to
go through the business of being made
known all over again.
Kangaroo
with
Everything
By HUGH CURNOW
u~f r was J ust terrifying,” said Rolf
I Harris with a sharp scowl at the,
memory. “There I was at the
‘Empire’ in Finsbury Park in London
having to go on stage as the act im-
mediately preceding the The Beatles.” He
let that sink in, then: “1 mean, what can
you do when you know that whatever
you do the kids will be screaming ‘We
want The Beatles! We want The Beatles!’
just like that?
“Know what 1 did? I did a few weird
numbers, comic things, send-up stuff and
so forth. If I’d tried to sing a rock num-
ber they would have killed me. As it was,
they listened and laughed. Especially
when 1 whacked in some crazy lyrics for
‘Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport’. Let me
see, what was it I sang to that? Oh yeah,
1 remember. I sang ‘Let me dingo go,
Ringo’. They just loved it.”
Back in Australia for a two-week caba-
ret show at Sydney's Chevron, Rolf
Harris was rehearsing a folk song about
Sydney written by Australian author,
Frank Hardy, when I called at the EMI
offices for an interview. He played the
now-familiar Rolf Harris oomp-ump,
oomp-ump accompaniment which he has
put to the Hardy song first on the
piano and then on two didgeridoos in
the corner.
“You’ve got to suck and blow' con-
tinually to keep the. er. note going on one
of these," he puffed. The result, a sort of
didgeridoo-toned wobble-board oomp-
ump, appeared to satisfy him after a
while. “I can’t wait to get to Darwin and
hear how they really play these things,
though,” he confided huskily.

What had he been doing since he left
Australia on the crest of “Tie Me Kanga-
roo Down, Sport” back in 1961? Well,
he’d gone to Canada by mistake, for one
thing. “My wife and I were on the
Oriana, bound, we thought, for Los
Angeles. But it went to Vancouver in-
stead. Actually it was a stroke of luck
because it was some sort of maiden visit
and all the Vancouver Press was there
and I got loads of free publicity and a
job at a nightclub called The Arctic. The
act went over real big. They love any-
thing remotely British in Vancouver.
They’re sick of big-headed Yanks com-
ing up from below the border to see
what they can rake out of the place, you
see.”
He grinned engagingly behind his run-
of-the-mill beard. “Vancouver is one of
my favorite places now. I ended up
doing 33 weeks at The Arctic before it
burnt down. Of course I had to do the
Kangaroo song every night but I also
sang Irish songs and Scottish songs, things
like that. I really learnt how to handle
an audience at The Arctic.”
As yet, however, he said he had not
learned how to handle an audition. “I just
can't do it without an audience. I did
an audition at San Francisco for the guy
who runs the Hungry I. I thought it was
a pretty way-out place and I'd be a
smash there. But he told me to forget it
after one song. It was even worse at the
Blue Angel in New York. After my first
audition there I just walked off the stage
straight out the door and didn't even say
goodbye.”
However, Harris made the grade at the
Blue Angel after the Kangaroo song was
released on an LP in America and be-
came a popular single item, reaching
Number Three on the US Hit Parade.
“They paid me 1000 dollars a week at
the Blue Angel after that. Thank heavens
I didn’t have to do another audition first.”

Tn a way, Harris says, he believes he
paved the path for the Beatles in
America. “Also Cliff Richard and Helen
Shapiro and the Japanese Sukiyaki song
that was such a hit. Until I came on the
scene foreigner’s songs just weren’t ac-
cepted on the Hit Parade there. Person-
ally I prefer ‘Sun Arise’ — the song I did
with an Aboriginal theme to ‘Tie Me
Kangaroo Down, Sport’ but it’s still the
‘Kangaroo’ one everyone wants to hear.
I do it with everything now.”
Actually, he said, he first went to
London hoping to become a painter.
“Between dashing off oil portraits of my
friends and playing at the Down Under
Club at Fulham I managed to make a
living before the ‘Kangaroo’ thing caught
on. It was a great shame I wasn’t in
London to promote that record there. I
could have done it live with my wobble-
board— that’s it against the wall and
my beard and all and helped things along
a lot. Still, you can’t have everything.”
After his Chevron show, Harris and his
Welsh-born wife, Alwen, and their 10-
month-old daughter, Bindi (we wanted to
call her something Aboriginal”), are off
to Darwin where he hopes to find some
new sounds and songs. Meanwhile he
says he has high hopes for his new
version of the old Phil Harris song, “The
Thing” and a second LP, called “All
Together Now”.
“That’s that line from the ‘Kangaroo’
song again. It sure hangs around,” he
said and winked happily. Then, later this
year back in London, the Harris image
will, he trusts, be projected further than
just steam radio. “There’s a West End
musical being built around me. In it I
have to do everything. Sing, dance, wise-
crack, act and paint! After all these
years ... I get to paint at last, and on
stage!”
Restaurant Prices
Charging like the Light Brigade
There has been considerable con-
troversy recently over the prices
charged for wine in restaurants.
There are, for example, many self-
service rooms around today. Many of
them operate under all sorts of fancy
names. The tables are varnished (saves
on linen), the decor is gay with exposed
bricks and bullfighting posters (saves on
drapes, plaster, wallpaper, paint, and
thought), there is rigid portion control
and you have to get up and get your
own wine and food. These places charge
like the Light Brigade. One only hopes
that the public will wake up to them
and demand better service or cheaper
prices. I am not against these bistro-
like places for a moment; merely the
prices.
Then we have the gay Continental
atmosphere, the hanging fish net, the
three dusty Chianti bottles huddled
around a long, dried - out string of
apologetic onions, hanging their heads in
shame. Pedro, the proud owner, picked
grapes at an inconsequential vineyard
in his homeland during vintage and this
has inevitably made him an expert in
the restaurant trade here. Reasonable
peasant food, rough but willing service,
gingham stable cloth (three changes a
week) and a seven bob bottle of wine
selling for 21s.
Often, however, there is a justification
for a 200 per cent mark up or even
more. There is one theatre restaurant in
Sydney that occasionally has a
three piece orchestra backing an artist
that has cost ten thousand dollars per
week to import. Yet there is no cover
charge. The law forbids it! So such pay-
ments must come from the food and
wine revenue. Again, a normal establish-
ment offering clean linen and appoint-
ments, reasonable service (about one
wine waiter to 30 or so clients), no floor
show or band, seems to be fully justified
in putting 60 to 70 per cent on the retail
price, that is, a 9s. bottle across the
counter selling for about 15s. in the
dining-room. The final net profit in both
cases is amazingly close.
And restaurants must inevitably be-
come more sophisticated and start to
store wines not for immediate sale. I
went to a place in Bordeaux that I under-
stand had over 300 different clarets,
some of them over 40 years old! People
came from all over the world to eat
there, and from what I can remember, '
the prices were not startling. Recently
in Adelaide we dined at a small place
and drank a couple of reasonably-priced
wines. The waiter heard our wine talk
and suggested we might like to try the
pick of the cellar, 1943 Reynella Red.
We were delighted with the wine and
gladly paid 325. 6d. for it.
Yet in the same town, at a famous
hotel, I went looking for something
special and was told they had none “be-
cause you can’t buy old wines any more”.
So it’s up to them to buy them young,
mature them, and then charge a decent
price for them. The younger, lighter
wines will still be here for people who
don’t want to pay the bit extra.
What to do about the obvious over-
charge? Recently I heard of a little
place without any pretension at all
except a very small light bill that charged
355. for a bottle of Pearl wine. This is
plainly preposterous. The customer in
question, after paying about sixpence a.
bubble, walked out without saying a
word. _l__ would have called the head
waiter, the manager, the owner, and if
necessary, the Mayor. I would have
written to the Press, any Wine and
Restaurant Association, the Prices Com-
missioner, and talked all day and every
day about it. In this way, eventually
the sharper restaurateurs will get the
message and will have to do something
about it to stay in business.
In conclusion, I must mention that I
have never complained nor have seen
anyone else so do, when the food, drink,
service, atmosphere, entertainment were
of such a standard that the price just
didn’t matter. People are prepared to
pay for the best. Unfortunately they so
rarely get it.

need Moomba. Yours truly, Combined
Welfare Organisations of Victoria.”
Letters of protest went off to the Prime
Minister, and the fuss over quarantine
regulations at one stage reached such a
pitch, many of us began to get an uneasy
feeling (falling) that Sir Robert was in
league with the Kremlin by allowing the
circus at all.
So it was rather fortunate that the tiger
lady arrived. Madame Margarita Naza-
rova wasn’t young, but she varied her
hairdo from pale blonde to deep red and
she was a fairly sexy-looking tiger lady.
She said: “Cruelty? In my act? The tigers
all love me. We are like brothers and
sisters together. I haven’t seen them for
two months. I have missed them so
much. When we are apart they don’t
eat.”
Then when the tigers actually did
arrive, the very Sunday before opening
day, a dear little baby tiger was born.
Either with a shrewd eye for public re-
lations, or perhaps with a touch of the
irony of Gogol, they called it “Moomba”.
Yes, let’s get together and have fun.
To get back to the worries of Mr Edg-
ley. Apart from getting the animals here
he has to feed them. This is costing £5O
a week. The bears have an incredible
diet of bread, groats, carrots, vegetables,
berries, eggs, honey, chalk, milk and hay.
The tigers get 76 kilos of meat a day,
plus nine eggs, 4! litres of milk, 18
litres of cod liver oil and a kilo of rice
for little Moomba.
Then, he had to provide all the equip-
ment, new. The tent by the Railways
sheds in Batman Avenue is really some-
thing to see. It cost £36,000 in Sydney
and seats, easily, 4000 people. Stafford
Bullen, who had the job of putting it up,
said: “We have had another four-pole
tent in Australia. But this is the highest.
Someone discovered that the flags on
top of the poles were the nautical signal
for “man overboard”. Perhaps Mr Edg-
ley was thinking very seriously of this.
All in all it takes 200 people to put on
the circus and over the 12-week tour he
has to get capacity houses almost every
night.
And every day the costs go up. The
Russians are very precise people. Every-
thing has to be just so. The lighting, all
new, cost £7OOO. Then the arena had to
be perfect—six inches of a special kind
of dry clay, two inches of coarse saw-
dust and on top of that a red carpet. On
dress rehearsal day they wanted a broad
raised runway all the way into the tent,
another £2OO.
As for the show it had a non-stop
bounce and verve. There was an army
of men, running all the time to move
equipment, even a squadron of red-
coated gentlemen with brooms who never
allowed a speck on the red arena carpet.
The act of the night was Vladimir
Doreyko’s somersault on 10-foot stilts.
He strutted up to a springboard and
it was obvious what he was going to do.
We all murmured. “Oh, no.” Two heavy-
weights dropped on the other end and
-up, up, up, and over he went, a great
Catherine wheel almost to the top of the
tent and down he came with an appall-
ing thump, upright, still on his stilts.
You never saw a man so delighted. The
audience gave him the slow rhythmic
Continental handclap and he did a
dancing circuit of triumph just like
Vladimir Kuts.
||/largarita Nazarova was pretty good
with her Siberian tigers. She sat on
them, pulled their tails, pulled their
whiskers, fed them meat out of her own
mouth. The bears were said to be very
weary after their sea trip, but they rode
their bicycles and motor cycles with quite
a sound knowledge of road safety. The
clowns had a curious air about them,
dressed in the American college style of
the 19205. They were very poker-faced,
and their antics reminded one exactly of
an old silent movie, which, perhaps, was
as it should be. The clowns Yuri Nikulin
and Michael admit that they have pat-
terned themselves on Buster Keaton.
After the show there was a get
together with drinks in the arena. But
it was an awkward affair. The Russians
stood at one end, the Australians at the
other. Lack of language is a terrible bar-
rier (which was a pity). Some of those
female Russian acrobats and contortion-
ists were so gorgeous I would have liked
to have taken them home.

MALCOLM X
“Only Southerners are any good ”
From MURRAY KEMPTON in New York
Malcolm X lived w'ith us white
Americans for thirty-nine years
w'hether in love or hate he
does not seem ever to have been quite
able to say until the afternoon he died.
We knew him first and W'e knew him
best as a Negro who insisted that the
white and fhe Negro could never be
reconciled.
Now that he is dead, it is odd how
sad we are and how pitiful he seems and
how pitiful, for all his dignity, he seems
always to have been in the memory. He
had preached that Negroes must arm
themselves against us the enemy, and
now he has been killed by armed Negroes
at a meeting from which all white
spectators had been barred.
His doctrine for most of his life as a
prophet had been the separation of the
races. Near the end he seems to have
been struggling unevenly towards the
notion of community. Even so, he re-
mained a man of Harlem and when he
came into white New York it was as an
ambassador from a great and hostile
nation. Yet he spent the last night of his
life at the New York Hilton Hotel,
right by Radio City, because he felt no
longer safe in Harlem. On Saturday
night he was a fugitive from black men;
and on Sunday his dignity insisted that
he go back among them, and now he is
dead.
It was his recollection, perhaps, hyper-
bole, that his father had been murdered
by w'hite men and thrown under a street-
car. And now his widow will need some-
day to explain to their four children with
their African names the youngest is
named Lomumbah that their father
was murdered by Negroes.
Like, so many men who have been
redeemed, Malcolm X may have exag-
gerated the sins of his youth as Malcolm
Little; still they W'ere substantial enough
to send him to prison for seven years for
larceny before he w'as tw'enty-one. There
he found the Nation of Islam, a black
separatist religion whose prophet was
Elijah Muhammed, born Elijah Poole in
Georgia. As theologian, Muhammed
taught a vague Moslemism, orthodox
mainly in its abjurations against alcohol,
tobacco and adultery; as historian, he
taught that the Negro was the first man
on earth and the white a usurper set in
power by the devil.
The Nation of Islam was, for Malcolm
Little, as it has been for other young
Negroes, the first self-governing com-
munity he had ever really known. He
accepted its moral disciplines and the
surname X in place of the Little which
Elijah Muhammed told him was the
brand left upon him by his grandfather’s
slavemaster.
Elijah Muhammed sent him to New
York as minister to the Nation of
Islam’s Harlem Mosque. He had an
exotic presence and a native wit and he
arrived at a time when he perfectly suited
the demands of electronic journalism.
There have been very few men whose
message fits so snug and yet so lively
into a two-minute segment of a news
broadcast.
That gift made him notorious and con-
tributed to the feeling we all had later
that Malcolm had been a creation of
journalism. And yet he was more than
that. I do not know a Negro so entirely
adjusted that there was not some part
of him which responded directly to what
Malcolm X was saying, just as I do not
know a Negro so entirely alienated that
a part of him does not respond to what
Martin Luther King is saying. By taking
his stand and enduring, Malcolm X
created a nation and a little part of every
Negro had a small allegiance tc him.
He had observed at one point that the
only white men the Negro could trust
were Southerners. “When you find a
white man who is any good at all, you
can bet he’s a Southerner who has
learned something.” He was talking to
me as a hybrid sort of Southerner and
it was painful how naive he suddenly
seemed. I tried to explain that we were
no better than anyone else; the difference
was that we were not afraid of Negroes
because where we had come from
Negroes hurt only other Negroes. I said,
to take an-instance, that I was incapable
of believing in Negro violence against
white people, and that therefore I could
not conceive of the Black Muslims as a
danger to my safety and that it was easy
then for me and other Southerners to be
at ease with him.
He tried to say that this passivity could
not long endure, and I answered that I
thought that Negroes would kill other
Negroes before they would kill us, which
occurs to me now as a horribly cruel
prophecy.
And then Malcolm X began talking
about fear and dignity and what it meant
to a young Negro to belong to the Nation
of Islam. “To be a Muslim,” he said, “is
to know' no fear.” And he w'as correct,
so far as any white man can judge a
Negro correct about other Negroes; there
w'as about the young men around him
then a quietness, a dignity and a contain-
ment; Elijah Muhammed had rescued
them from fear.
He told us the Muslims were trying
to kill him; but most of us had thought
of him so long as our fantasy and our
creation that this seemed to us another
piece of the posture of an actor. So on
Sunday he was murdered by young men
very much like the ones who had sur-
rounded him only a year ago. I do not
think until now that I have ever known
what a terrible thing a ghetto is.

British
Racism
The color iceberg goes deep
Color is now Britain’s biggest social
problem. Everyone, of course, has
heard about the Foreign Secretary,
Mr Patrick Gordon Walker, losing his
Parliamentary seat in Birmingham be-
cause of this issue, which was played up
during the October general election by
his opponents. A few people with access
to British papers may also have noticed
that the Labor Party club in this par-
ticular constituency operates its own
color bar, and had to be formally re-
buked by Mr Harold Wilson shortly
after the latter had delivered himself
of a Parliamentary broadside against
Gordon Walker’s successful Tory op-
ponent. So here we have a situation
where the local Labor party is out of
step with the national leadership, and
sentimentally closer to its Conservative
opponents than to its own proclaimed
doctrine.
This, however, is merely the tip of
the iceberg. The fact is that Labor very
nearly lost the election on the color issue,
and would certainly havejost if Gaitskell
rather than Wilson had been in charge.
Gaitskell, in his high-minded manner,
had committed the party (much against
the inclination of its rank-and-file) to
voting against fhe 1962 Immigration Bill
limiting the entry of colored immigrants
from the Commonwealth. Some voters
remembered this and were duly resent-
ful, though in the end Labor just
managed to squeeze in (the half-dozen
seats that were lost on this issue make
quite a difference, given the Govern-
ment’s slim majority). By now it has
been stated that the 1962 Act will be
prolonged and that Labor will support it,
pending talks with the various Common-
wealth Governments to find a new for-
mula. This last is strictly eyewash.
Everyone knows the main provisions of
the Act are going to stay.
How much of a problem is it? Not
much by American standards, but Britain
a homogeneous society and not used
to mass immigration of non-Europeans.
In 1951 there were only 50,000 coiored
residents in the whole country (out of
50 million). Now there are 800,000, in-
cluding some 300,000 from India and
Pakistan. By the end of the century,
even without further mass immigration,
there will probably be three million.
Britain will then have something resemb-
ling America’s current problem, for no
one in his senses believes that these people
can be assimilated.
The interesting thing in all this has
- been the reaction of the Liberal Estab-
lishment, which runs the better-class

newspapers and the other communica-
tions media. While the two great parties
in the end predictably agreed upon a
policy of limited immigration (though
only after Labor had got rid of Hugh
Gaitskell and his little coterie), the
Liberals first stood out against it, and
then very reluctantly conceded that
there might be a problem—but only in
so far as it was caused by bad housing.
This happens to be nonsense, but it has
become a kind of second line of defence.
The argument runs that this is purely
an economic problem, and that with a
little goodwill, etc . . . Not surprisingly,
the people who take this line are them-
selves comfortably ensconced in middle-
class suburbs and hardly ever meet a
West Indian or a Pakistani. It is the
working class who have to live with the
new immigrants, compete for jobs with
them, and put up with annoyances which
seem trifling to their betters but are quite
real to people who have to live in crowd-
ed neighborhoods.
The Liberals, then, can take credit for
having been more principled and more
civilised than the two big parties, though
to some extent their freedom from
racialism is quite simply due to their
being sheltered from the sordid realities
of everyday life, (from “Commentary"')
Sukarno’s Home
Fires Burn
4000 free for action elsewhere
While Indonesia explores the op-
portunities for reaching a pro-
fitable settlement of its quarrel
with Malaysia, a series of growing do-
mestic problems seems likely to impel
President Sukarno to step up still further
his campaign against the young Federa-
tion. Unrest is increasing among the
peasants in rural parts of Java. Cor-
ruption and poor administration have
brought the land reforms, promised in
1960, to a standstill, and Communist
agitation is playing upon the peasants’
hunger for land. Natural disaster has
helped the Communists in this work,
for widespread floods have destroyed
thousands of acres of rice plantations.
Last August Sukarno ruled that Indo-
nesia would no longer buy rice abroad,
but sheer necessity has now compelled
him to . sign a new contract to import
100,000 tons of rice from Burma this
year.
The Communist peasant front has
instructed its members to take massive
action to implement the Land Reform
Act on their own. As a result Commu-
nist peasants have seized plots of land
from the landlords, and have even
grabbed arable land owned by the State.
Some—mostly Muslim —landlords have
also taken the law into their own hands
and driven off the squatters. In a num-
ber of places the police have inter-
vened. Peasants have been killed in
clashes in West, Central and East Java,
and in the neighboring islands of Lom-
bok and Bali. Hundreds have been
gaoled. Confronted with this reaction
the Communists have begun to vary
their tactics, but still using the peasants
to, assess what their power would be in
an eventual showdown with the Muslim
majority, and to discover how the armed
forces would respond. There is evi-
dence of this testing operation, particu-
larly in East Java. From their strong-
hold in the province’s capital city of
Surabaya the Communists are probing
the Muslim-dominated hinterland.
The worried Government in Djakarta
regularly summons local authority rep-
resentatives to' give first-hand reports of
this skirmishing. What adds to Govern-
ment sensitivity is the gloomy economic
situation. Export earnings failed to reach
the 1964 target of 30 billion rupiahs, and
were only slightly above the 22-billion
rupiah earnings of 1963. The increase
remains far below Indonesia’s swelling
needs. The Association of Indonesian
Exporters has voiced fear of a further set-
back as a result of dwindling production,
deterioration of quality, coupled with
rising domestic production costs and
prices. The slogan “To’stand on our own
feet” sponsored by Indonesian political
leaders is held up to ridicule. For every
grain of rice, every inch of cloth-—in
short, for every bit of what is considered
a native product—imported chemicals
or materials are needed. The prospect
of a 50-million dollar credit from China
brought a ray of hope. But many compe-
tent Indonesian technicians wonder if
Chinese spare pqrts will fit the mostly
Western-made machinery.
Meantime, f the growing influence of
the Chinese is eyed uneasily by the
armed forces. There is no doubt that
the more militant attitude of the Indo-
nesian Communist Party (PKI) results
from Indonesia’s closer ties with Peking
after quitting the United Nations. The
navy and army chiefs of staff have
appealed to their forces to maintain
unity and guard against dissension. It
is in this atmosphere that Sukarno may
be expected to have renewed recourse
to distract attention by drumming up
hostility to Malaysia. He has an addi-
tional 4000 men experienced in jungle
warfare available for guerrilla activity.
Until recently they have been employed
against the Darul Islam rebels in the
South Celebes. With the killing of the
rebel leader Kahar Muzakar they are
now free for action elsewhere. At the
same time there is purpose in Foreign
Minister Subandrio's exploring the pos-
sibilities of renewed talks with Malaysia
through mediation by lapan and Pakis-
tan. Indonesia would expect successful
efforts by Japan to be followed by an
extension of economic relations between
the two countries. And as a Muslim
nation Pakistan might get support from
other Muslim States in a mediation role.
Indonesia sees other opportunities to
exert pressure on Malaysia coming
along: the anniversary of the .first Afro-
Asian conference to be celebrated in
Djakarta in April, demonstrating Afro-
Asian solidarity with Indonesia but
without Malaysia; the second conference
in Algiers in June. If efforts to bring
them to a conference table fail, these
dates could be a prelude to a period
of greater tension between Indonesia
and Malaysia, (ofns)

|Pf- In the gravest Asian crisis an American President has had to face since the Korean War,
President Johnson has moved from retaliation against North Vietnam to a policy which stops just
short of escalation. Instead of "tit-for-tat" he has approved a “free-strike" response.
In the United Nations the United States is also emphasising the theme of the "White Paper" (dubbed
a "black book which I have not read" by Russia's Mr Kosygin) which it has sent to the Security Council.
This documents Hanoi's "concealed aggression" against South Vietnam. American representatives
elsewhere are stressing Mr Dean Rusk's insistence that there can be no negotiations until North Vietnam
leaves its neighbor alone.
Militarily, more American advisers are leaving for Saigon. Their main task is to train another
100,000 troops for the South Vietnamese Army. In the heaviest raid yet on North Vietnam, 160 American
and Vietnamese planes dropped 200 tons of bombs on the port of Quang Khe and a munitions depot
at Xom Dang. Six planes were lost. The raids will go on, and American sources in South Vietnam have
indicated they will be enlarged. So will the strafing and bombing of Vietcong ground forces.
Peking repeats almost daily that a "single step by the United States over the 17th parallel would
constitute aggression against the whole socialist camp".
The "whole socialist camp" is, as events in Peking and Moscow continue to show, an abstraction.
The official Peking "People's Daily" has called the "great" Soviet-China debate unsolvable until
someone buries Khrushchevism. The newspaper says that although Mr Khrushchev has been removed
from the political scene, he is not "dead and buried". It did not name the present Kremlin leaders
as responsible for keeping him alive but made it clear who was to blame by launching its attack at the
conclusion of the Soviet-sponsored meeting in Moscow attended by 19 Communist Parties. Absent
were the Chinese, Albanian, North Vietnamese, North Korean, Japanese and Indonesian parties.
Present were parties from Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. In Moscow's socialist camp,
pitched on the snowswept Lenin Hills, the Soviet party tried to calm the anxieties of European
Communist Parties, like Italy's and Poland's, which find the time unsuitable for a final split with China.
The Australians and the Indians are pressing for an eventual world conference to condemn China.
HHgT" Moscow is finding it easier to talk to Paris than to Peking. President de Gaulle, whose country was
thrown out of South-East Asia eleven years ago, accepts the Soviet Union's proposal for a
peace conference on Vietnam because it suits his goals for a return of French influence in the area;
because it is an example of his Third Force in world affairs; because it embarrasses the United States;
and because in his view it proves that Britain, which has supported the United States, really stands outside
"/'Europe".
gpgg?- Fresident Nosser is planning a State visit to East Germany in return for Herr Walter Ulbricht s
ceremonial visit to Cairo. Under the Hallstein Doctrine, Bonn must cut diplomatic relations with any
country officially recognising the East German Government. President Nasser has done everything but.
Last week the United Arab Republic claimed it had smashed a West German spy ring which, in
Bonn's assessment, was adding "insult to injury". Yet Bonn is re-negotiating its own trade agreement
with East Germany to protect its growing economic ties with the Ulbricht regime.


Israel, meanwhile, is bargaining for a direct supply of American arms, but is refusing to accept American
requests to tone down its threat to go to war if the Arabs interfere with its irrigation plans for conversion
of the Jordan waters.
Mr Lester Pearson's proposal to cut Canada's last "humiliating" legislative link with Britain will
touch off a new debate as long as the recent one over a new flag. Mr Pearson wants to amend a 98-year-old
basic law under which the Canadian Constitution has up to now resided in London.
This may reinforce the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism set up eighteen months
ago (when separatist terrorism based in Quebec spread across the country) which concluded: "Canada
is passing through the greatest crisis in its history, one that could destroy it if permitted to deepen.“
The clash of English and French cultures was a matter of urgency now, according to the Commission,
because of the emergence of the new, young, educated French-speaking classes in Quebec.

FORUM
The Minister for Gimmicks
A French view of Andre Malraux
By ANDRE THIERRY
We're not talking about the man and
his work (they command respect),
but about the Minister you
might almost say the politician of arts
who since de Gaulle came to power on
May 13, 1958, has ruled over one of
our most precious treasures, perhaps our
last real “capital”: French culture and
art. When he was appointed we wished
him every success. The author of
Man’s Fate might find a Royal Road for
his talent, ambition and stature, we
thought along with a few thousand
somewhat naive artists and intellectuals.
But disgust has followed the deceptions
and revolt replaced indignation.
The first triumph of his reign was
laughable. Malraux sent the Mona Lisa
to the Americans and the Venus de Milo
to the Japanese to represent “Eternal
France”. Tens of thousands of regimented
citizens filed between two policemen in
order to get spiritually drunk in fifteen
seconds and discover the beauties of the
Greek and Renaissance canons of art.
The tidy budget allotted to the Ministry
was calculated to throw dust in people’s
eyes, but in the same period the great
international expositions passed Paris by;
the most important ones opened in other
capitals. Abroad, no large-scale exhibi-
tions of French art were organised. And
why doesn’t the City of Light have an
exposition hall worthy of the name? Why
aren't there funds to organise an exhibi-
tion with an international stamp? Why
isn't the Paris public taught to appreciate
the great works of art? Why do those in
charge think that flying six banners out-
side an exhibition fulfils their duty to
culture? (Publicity is ignored unless it

Andre Malraux, Minister of
Fine Arts. At the time the
appointment was acclaimed
throughout the world. French
critics have now had second
thoughts.
promotes the Minister’s personal pres-
tige.) Private initiative is forced to com-
pensate for official shortcomings, but
we’ve seen admirable exhibitions in big
museums all but deserted. The fact is
that in Paris you have a “Success” when
an exhibition draws a fourth of the
attendance it would draw in any other
European city. Therefore organisers of
international exhibitions are not attracted
to France.
An impressive exhibition hall stands in
the centre of Paris the Grand Palais,
which, despite its well-known drawbacks,
has the merit of existing. Malraux has
decided to make it into a school, with a
student dining hall. The alterations will
cost as much as would a new building,
and the result will be mediocre. The
Grand Palais will never be any good
as a university and it will be spoiled
as a monument. Strategically, the
location is ill-chosen; student malcon-
tents need only cross the Champs-
Elysees to run into the bodyguards
of the President of the Republic.
Meanwhile, artists are read pretty
promises. But there won’t be a Salon
d’Automme! And no suitable hall for the
big exhibitions.
Malraux is great at making promises.
His talent is unmatched. One after an-
other he charms the committees he deigns
to receive. First raised to Parnassian
heights (generally having nothing to do
with the subject), they are then plunged
into a bath of “grandeur” which freezes
them at attention; finally they’re packed
off to those who sent them with the
medal of arts and letters around their
necks as a reward for good conduct.
The “one per cent” is.a perfect example
of his trickery. By law, one per cent of
the budget for school construction must
be allotted to artists working in collabora-
tion with architects. One hoped that
under Malraux this policy of artistic co-
operation would be pulled out of the
bog of municipal deals; one hoped that
Malraux, with his prestige, would ask
Parliament to extend the one per cent not
just to public works but to factories and
other major buildings. Thousands of
artists looked forward to a period of mar-
vellous creative competition. But Mal-
raux made it clear that “France's money
wasn’t meant for poor artists,” and he's
acted accordingly. The young must attain
fame and old age before the Minister
notices them. There will be no real
artistic encouragement, no movement in
the plastic arts that might rejuvenate
city planning and architecture.
There was —let’s not forget it—
“ Operation Art to the Masses”! Twenty
masterpieces were set up in the Renault
cafeteria and the workers coming back
from the counters with their trays were
invited to observe the brushwork of the
impressionists. When the “good bour-
geois” stoops to “the people” he comes up
with this sort of Little Goody Two Shoes.
No need to go to the masterpieces, they'll
come to you! Result: zero. Art has to
be earned, and you don’t discover it be-
tween two spoonfuls of soup. By all

means try to get workers to understand
art, make their introduction to it easier,
give them the leisure in which to cultivate
themselves; but don’t premasticate their
aesthetic feeling for them. It’s insulting or
downright idiotic.
At the same time our museum curators
are the worst in the world and every year
it's getting harder to recruit new ones.
There aren't enough guards and the
museums close at the very hour when
you have time to visit them. No -serious
art historian will henceforth be tempted
by a curator’s career. At the top level of
the hierarchy he makes less than half as
much as a professor. The source of supply
is drying up.
The number of dwellings that are put
up every year in France would make a
city the size of Marseilles. But building is
haphazard, piecemeal. The tragedy is
that the architects continue to learn
their trade —their art—according to
ideas conceived in schools that belong
to another age.
PR for Grandeur
It is vitally necessary to reform the
teaching at the Beaux-Arts. Last July
the famous architect Marcel Lods re-
signed from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in
order to issue a solemn warning. Not only
has Malraux failed to make a decision
unless it is to turn the various tenden-
cies against each other and exacerbate
their mutual hostility but every time he
has had the opportunity to demonstrate
his dynamic approach to art, his will to
act effectively, he has chosen badly, as
we saw in the business of the Paris
d’Orsay, when Le Corbusier was sent
packing. There’s every reason to fear
we’ll soon have another example in the
100,000-seat stadium at Vincennes.
He fails to choose a modern idiom for
a modern city? He allows an excrescence
like the barracks called the “Cite des
Arts”? Worse is to come; he is indifferent
to the damage done Paris’ heritage.
There’s the scandal of the Commission on
Sites which, when certain members’
financial interests are involved, accepts
urban development plans that common
sense would condemn, which allows some
historic building to be torn down because
real estate speculators are waiting to
grab the land.
And what has he done about the teach-
ing of art in secondary schools? What's
he done about granting a tax deduction
similar to that allowed in the United
States for people who leave works of
art to the State? Why aren’t chateaux
and monuments that are threatened with
destruction being protected? The truth
is, most of the money allocated to the
preservation of historical monuments is
being spent to dig moats that never
existed around the Louvre!
The present regime had the good luck
to inherit some fine government servants
together with already worked-out plans.
And so it took over the liner France. In
the ministerial files it found projects for
instituting “houses of culture” and clean-
ing the facades of Paris. And Malraux,
who claims to be encouraging the popular
theatre, lets Vilar go! Well, our streets
may end up clean but with no parking
lots in Paris and no plans to build any.
Soon no one will be able to walk around
Paris and admire the facades which, inci-
dentally, being cleaned on the chapel, will
be filthy in two years.
We needed a Minister of Culture. We
got an aesthete who’s having fun. We
wanted someone bold; we got a PR man
for grandeur. We wanted an organiser;
we got a mountebank who indulges his
whims.

Selecting an accounting machine is no small
decision, because what you buy will affect your
office costs (and net profits) for years ahead. It’s
less a matter of initial capital outlay and more a
question of how much per year your accounting
machine system will cost over its working life.
That’s why NCR is the logical choice of
thousands of Australian businessmen who recog-
nize the economy of Quality. An NCR Accounting
Machine costs you less in the long run because of
its superior mechanical reliability, resulting in
lower maintenance expense and extra years of
faithful service. Unlike a watch, which may be five
seconds fast or slow, an accounting machine must
always be accurate to the penny. To ensure this
accuracy, every twelfth person at our factories is
an inspector ... a simple but powerful slogan
guides every individual and combined effort that
goes into the manufacture of NCR equipment —•
“An NCR product is 100% WRONG if it is not
100% RIGHT!”

Letters to the Editor
Art Jargon
SlR.—Communication of ideas has
never been easy, largely due to an
imprecise use and understanding of the
tool of language. It becomes even more
difficult when the tool is overladen with
an aggregation of pompous and poly-
syllabic words which conceal the com-
municable concept in a plethora of
periphrasis. Whoops! The disease is
catching.
I refer particularly to a baroque piece
of waffling to be found in Frank Coz-
zarelli’s review of Godfrey Miller’s
“memorial retrospective” at the Darling-
hurst Galleries (8., February 27).
Quote: “his figuration is unameliorably
incompatible with his fundamentally
abstract moralistic polemic”.
With the assistance of the OED I
have attempted an inelegant literal
translation which leaves me in even
greater confusion. To wit: “His out-
lining is, in a manner unable to be
caused to become better, inconsistent
with his essentially separated-from-
matter, morality-teaching, controversial-
discussion”. Please, what does Mr
Cozzarelli MEAN?

The Film Industry
SIR.—Mr Les Pitt (8., February 27)
asks why Mr Charles Higham, in the
article “Have Australian - Films Any
Future?” failed to mention Giorgio
Mangiamele, and points to the quality
and style of this Melbourne film direc-
tor’s work, while mentioning some of
Colin Bennett’s appreciative comments.
Mr Higham’s amazing reply is that he
can’t share his enthusiasm for “Clay”
(Mangiamele’s latest 35mm full-length
feature film). This gratuitous opinion
not only doesn’t answer the question,
but shows that Mr Higham considers
himself the supreme judge of Australian
film production.
He reached ridiculous heights when,
in trying to criticise the critic (Colin
Bennett) who states in one of his re-
views that Mangiamele’s “style” echoes
the Italian neo-realism, he asks since
when were echoes of neo-realism indi-
cative of quality? Would it be childish
to ask in return: since when is a “style”
not indicative of quality? And, after
all, what does Mr Higham know about
the quality of Mr Mangiamele’s works?
Is he a film critic, an art critic, or just
what?
Needless to say, I had the privilege
of seeing “Clay” at the Palais, St Kilda,
at a private screening attended by about
300 selected guests, and I feel sure that
Australia has never produced a “per-
sonal” film of such a superb artistic
standard.
I was told that Mr Mangiamele
worked over one year for 15 hours
daily, surmounting more obstacles in
one day than Mr Higham would be
likely to face in a lifetime at his edi-
torial desk, where he presides and de-
cides who are the ones in Australia
“making an effort to create personal
films”.
JEFF HOPKINS
East Melbourne (Vic.).
Charles Higham writes: Mr Hopkins is
entitled to his opinion even if, to judge
by his letter, I am not. However, it
might be pointed out that a capacity
to work 15 hours a day—or 24—is not
necessarily an indicator of talent.
“The Catholic Worker"
SIR. —The most interesting feature of the
rather pecksniffian letters of T. M. Butler
and F. G. Keating defending “The Catho-
lic Worker” (8., February 20) is that
they neglect entirely the major issue
which your article “New Catholic Split”
raised: the dissatisfaction of many non-
Movement Catholics with the attitudes
expressed in a number of “CW” articles
in the last few years relating to Com-
munist subversion in Australia and Asia.
This dissatisfaction extends, certainly, to
people like myself, who, although not
Catholics, have given financial and politi-
cal support to the “CW”.
I supported the “CW” in 1959 when
it made a comprehensive and penetrating
attack on the Santamaria Movement. I
also supported the “CW” when it de-
nounced the 1959 Peace Congress as “a
sham . . . because the guiding hands be-
hind the Congress are Communist”, when
it exposed the enormous political influ-
ence gained by Communists through
unity tickets, and when it published
sophisticated analyses of the cold war
tactics of the totalitarian powers.
More recently, however, the “CW”
has found room to accommodate a
different style of politics. The follow-
ing are some disturbing examples:
• Dr Max Charlesworth’s persistent
argument that the Communist danger to
Australia represents only “a minor men-
ace”, and that the significance of such
Communist strategems as unity tickets
has been “enormously exaggerated”;
• The case made out by the “CW”
columnist “Marum” after the Chinese
attack on India that it was India's very
neutralism and pacifism which probably
caused the Chinese to withdraw (no
doubt rather red-faced and feeling a bit
ashamed of themselves);
• The editorial on the recent Sydney
Peace Congress in which it was inferred
that, although the Congress was appar-
ently not Communist-inspired and mani-
pulated. even if it were a bit of a natter
with the Comms might do us all a bit
of good anyway;
• The book review in the last issue
of the “CW”, in which the reviewer, in
the midst of dealing pretty realistically
with a book on the Church in Cuba,
stopped his critical flow to explain to
the reader that, just in case he was
giving the wrong impression, he was
really a “zealous anti-anti-Communist”
after all.
The perplexing thing is that this form-
erly uncharacteristic tone should manifest
itself in “The Catholic Worker” at a
time when the Communist danger to
Australia is moving almost daily from
the area of the ominous to the area of
the calamitous.

Australian Verse
SIR.—Mr James Dickey, the well-known
American poet and critic, has asked me to
collect together volumes and uncollected
material by Australian poets who have
brought out a book, for an article he is
planning to write for “The New Yorker”
on Australian verse. Would poets there-
fore please send one published book and
a small selection of representative uncol-
lected poems (say, not more than eight)
to me c/o The Bulletin, to reach me no
later than March 30. If necessary,
material can be returned^-

REVIEWS
THEATRE
Macbeth in Miniature
By DAVID MARTIN
Macbeth. William Shakespeare. Emerald
Hill Theatre, Melbourne.
The modern producer of Macbeth has
a choice between five possible ap-
proaches. He can present it as an Eng-
lish melodrama pure and simple. He
can see it as the Japanese might, as a
tale brutal and sombre, with Macbeth
and Macduff as two mighty samurai in
a war of loyalties. He can falljback on
the Greek concept of tragedy: man
against the avenging gods. He can give
us a play of psychological subtlety in
the contemporary manner, with the
poetry subordinated to the conflict of
characters, especially between Macbeth
and his lady, and with the Hamlet traits
accentuated in the former. he
can return to the 19th-century style of
heroic declamation. If he has not the
actors or resources for these, he
may attempt a vigorous and sincere mid-
way production, relying on the drama’s
intrinsic power to stimulate a hundred
different responses. In that case he
must eschew all gimmicks.
How, in fact, he will solve his problem
must mainly depend on his theatre and
his company. The stage at Emerald
Hill offers opportunities as well as
temptations; it is the largest in Mel-
bourne, relative to the auditorium, and
is arranged somewhat as in an- Eliza-
bethan playhouse. The troupe consists
of amateurs (which the critic dare not
forget) with the exception of a few ex-
perienced principals. The director, Wal
Cherry, is given to experiments and his
spirit pervades every enterprise. The
interplay of these factors explains the
success and failure of this Macbeth.
The size of the proscenium and the
logistics of Emerald Hill make for aus-
terity and sparseness. This, coupled
with rejection of the traditional, the
impossibility of getting this cast to
bring out the poetry, and the needs of
an audience chiefly composed of leav-
ing certificate and matric. students,
points to the Sophocles compromise.
Indeed, at first this seems to be what
we are offered. Sets, lighting and, more
importantly, speech and movement hint
at the coming defeat of hapless, earth-
rooted mortals by the evil masters of
some Caledonian Olympus. Marcella
Burgoyne's Electra-like Lady Macbeth
particularly suggests this.
But if this was the idea it is soon dis-
sipated. The bareness of the set designed
by George Whaley—three low ramps
and a black backdrop—compels inordi-
nately athletic or prolonged entries and
exits, and militates against poised solemn-
ity. On a high level this is paralleled
by a contradiction between how the
actors speak (almost conversationally)
and how they stand and walk —like new
pupils of Mr Kean. As the night pro-
ceeds it becomes clear that we shall not
get Sophocles, but also not enough
Shakespeare: there is a perpetual twilight
that obscures rather than spiritually
darkens, the cawing of crows that be-
comes a signature tune, authentic but
nightgownly, unwarlike costumes, and
what may have started as an ideal of
simplicity finally becomes, if not a gim-
mick, then a self-conscious technique.
But this is too harsh: there are moments
of beauty and some scenes of consider-
able plasticity.
George Whaley plays Macbeth, and
this selection upsets what unifying plan
the production started out with. He is
an outstandingly gifted actor, but he is
never a general, of Scotland nor even
of Elsinore. He lacks most of the
physical equipment, which would per-
haps not matter greatly but for two real
misfortunes. If he cannot speak strongly
he must speak beautifully—after all he
has immortal lines! But with him dis-
cretion turns into understatement. He
throws away some of the finest passages,
apparently deliberately, as if they were
afterthoughts. By contrast, Mark Al-
biston’s Macduff has all the power and,
without ever falling into recitation, he can
speak Shakespeare as he should be
spoken. As a result (and this, of
course, is an ever-present danger in Mac-
beth) he dominates completely, reducing
the regicide to a secondary figure.
There’s the melodrama, but it would
require a fount of violence that does
not gush in their castle. When Mac-
beth leaves the chamber where Dun-
can and his grooms lie murdered he
is more properly a sleepwalker than
Lady Macbeth is.
Nowadays we get little Shakespeare,
and it would be naif to apply Stratford
standards in South Melbourne. That's
another dilemma. How can young
actors who hardly ever see Shakespeare
acquire conviction? The wonder is that
they still make it an interesting evening.
Bathroom Farce
Diplomatic Baggage. John Chapman. Palace
Theatre, Sydney.
“Diplomatic Baggage" is pretty bad but
it might have been done better. If the
preoccupation of theatre managements is
with getting people away from their tele-
vision sets, they’ll never do it by casting
television faces whose performing experi-
ence is limited to announcing the channel
number and the time of day, as often
as not getting one of them wrong.
Also, people who watch television
learn a bit of what is going on in the
world. ‘‘Diplomatic Baggage" has some-
thing to do with a top British and a top
French civil servant, some time after
Brussels, signing a 10-year trade agree-
ment in the bathroom of a Paris hotel,
surrounded by under-dressed French
girls. However, while audiences mightn't
know all about the Common Market, they
have learnt in recent years that British
men of affairs no longer have to go to
Paris for their affairs. A Whitehall farce
for our times could deal with a serious-
minded, crew-cut French trade expert
coming to London to negotiate a trade
agreement and learning about the off-
stage Whitehall farces.
PATRICIA ROLFE
The Clerk’s Tale
Diary of a Madman. Nikolai Gogol.
Adapted by Peter O'Shaughnessy. In-
dependent Theatre. Sydney.
Gogol's madman is one of that army of
public servants who throng the pages
of Russian literature, making 19th-
century Russia seem nothing but a vast,
proliferating bureaucracy. Poorly paid,
without hope of advancement, but cling-
ing to a precarious and shabby gentility,
this middle-aged clerk has nothing but
dreams to sustain him.
In his adaptation of Gogol's short
story, Peter O'Shaughnessy has com-
bined a vivifying dramatic imagination
with respectful sympathy for his author.
The story seems to fall naturally into
Mr O'Shaughnessy's three acts. In the
first act we see the discontented clerk,
reluctant to go to work and overhear-
ing dogs talking, but not yet very
obviously mad. In the extraordinary
second act, in which Peter O'Shaughnessy
uses a dog mask with wonderful effec-
tiveness while he is reading the dogs’
correspondence, the poor clerk shakes off
the burden of the real world. And in
the final act, in the lunatic asylum, Mr
O'Shaughnessy gives him a Lear-like
dignity of suffering which does not seem
inappropriate for a mind-created King
of Spain.
By the liveliness of his- miming and
by the imaginative use of costumes,
music, lighting and such traditional
theatrical conventions as disappearing
behind a screen to indicate the passage

Whiffs of Jazz

Future historians will probably dismiss as
a quaint delusion the idea that the music
of the first half of the 20th century was
marked by a reaction against romantic-
ism. The bundle of orchestral works listed
above, ranging from 1907 to 1956, re-
minds us how many more 20th-century
composers have been of Dionysian rather
than the Appollonian persuasion.
The only work among them that may
reveal some conscious anti-romanticism
is the Ravel concerto, with its whiffs of
jazz, touches of irony and faint obeisan-
ces to the 18th century. But even here
the spirit that hovers over the “big tune”
in first movement is surely that of Liszt
rather than Rameau.
Nevertheless this is “absolute” music
to the extent that it is meant to be listened
to and enjoyed purely for its own sake,
and Entremont, Ormandy and the Phila-
delphia Orchestra give it a crackling per-
formance. Entremont shows all the dyna-
mism he had on his most recent Austra-
lian visit, plus a technical reliability that
sometimes eluded him then. (The record-
ing has won a Grand Prix du Disque in
France.)
On the other side is a work that makes
no renunciations of romanticism: Falla's
“Nights in the Gardens of Spain”, for
piano and orchestra; this too is exuberant-
ly performed.
The case of Bartok's “Two Portraits”
of 1907 is rather curious. The very
beautiful first movement, a study in
sinuously lyrical counterpoint featuring a
solo violin part, reappears as the first
movement of the recently discovered
Violin Concerto No. 1, which was com-
posed about the same time. Neither work
can be said to have supplanted the other,
for in both cases Bartok added a second
movement, each thematically and drama-
tically related to the shared first move-
ment, yet one quite different from the
other (and in both cases, I feel, inferior
to the first movement). So we have two
works of equal status, having the main
part of their material in common.

“Rashomon” Revisited
The Outrage. Director, Martin Ritt. St
James Theatre, Sydney.
The basic theme of this film is an exa-
mination of the nature of truth as illu-
strated by four differing versions of the
story of a rape and killing—by a bandit,
by the violated woman, by her dead
husband (through a medium) and by
a hidden eyewitness.
The plot, evidently, has an unending
fascination for directors; it first saw the
light in Kurosawa's “Rashomon”, a
much-admired film which put Japan on
the international cinematic map.
The repetitious nature of the plot
(which .is beginning to show signs of
wear and tear) is even more evident in
“The Outrage”. The director, Martin
Ritt, teeters uneasily between reverent
imitation of Kurosawa and ill-advised
personal touches. The final sequence,
which shows the story stripped of the
pretensions and evasions of the partici-
pants' narrations, tumbles disastrously
into near-slapstick.
The performances are poor. As the
Mexican bandit, Paul Newman has
adopted a thick “Ai Carramba!” accent
which, when strained through a black,
Fu Manchu moustache renders him
practically incomprehensible. Laurence
Harvey looks more like* a fancily-
dressed spiv than an effete Southern
gentleman: a rather w'orn Claire Bloom
makes little impression as the violated
wife.

No Excitement
Sydney Little Symphony: Conductor,
Joseph Post. Cell-Block Theatre, Sydney.
The Sydney Little Symphony series has
been a success in every way. The ABC
has filled the Cell-Block for these con-
certs as many times as it has wanted.
The programming has been on oc-
casions adventurous: for example, the
premiere performance of Richard
Meale's “Homage to Garcia Lorca”.
The performing of Frank Martin's
wonderful 1945 work, “Petite Sym-
phonic Concertante”, for the third time
since the series began, was wrong, as it
not only suggests to subscribers that the
concerts are falling into a rut, but
also suggests that those responsible

tion necessary to find new or rarely per-
formed works for a chamber orchestra.
Generally the performance during the
evening was lacking in the usual spirit
and vigor we have come to expect from
Joseph Post and the Little Symphony.
I believe the reason is that the musicians
do not have their heart in works that
are so commonplace and uninspired,
aftd their apathy is transmitted to the
audience.

Dons and Lovers
By R. M. WILDING
The Quest for Love. David Holbrook,
i Methuen. 595.
For David Holbrook in the notoriously
banned ‘"Quest for Love”, literature is not
a game, nor a deceit—attitudes he
sternly criticises but something that
should show us how to live. The dangers
of this approach are obvious enough in
the imperative “should”, and in the as-
sumption that there is a way to live. I
don't think we need quarrel with his argu-
ment that modern literature is often
cynical, disbelieving in the possibility of
human relationships, and uninterested in
married love; and I don't think we need
quarrel when he says that modern litera-
ture is essentially one-sided, and ignoring
whole areas of experience. But Mr Hol-
brook does not stop there his purpose
is to reinstate the primacy of married and
procreative love as the central concern of
literature.
He begins with a chapter on “The
quest for love and our sense of reality”
which he subtitles “Recent psy-
choanalytical theories of the
origins of. consciousness”. Mr
Holbrook is not a psychologist,
and though the hypotheses he
summarises and accepts are
interesting, he does not seem
enough aware of the tentative-
ness with which theories on the
development of consciousness in
the child need at present to be
held, nor of the many different
suggestions that current research is of-
fering. To base a theory of literary
criticism on the birth trauma a concept
viewed with suspicion by many psycholo-
gists w'ould seem rash. But this is
what Mr Holbrook does. From the
“facts” of the child's growing awareness
of the w'orld and of love, we are to
evaluate literature. “The strange appeal
of ‘anti-art’, present-day cults of futility
in art, and that aestheticism which seeks
to deny the influence of art in living,
would seem to have some connection
with that "hopelessness in respect of the
attainment of a personal life’ such as is
found in those w r ho are mentally ill
through severe birth traumata.” Even if
this is true it would seem irrelevant to
art: as William James argued, because a
mystic's visions can be ascribed to physio-
logical causes, the vision is not necessarily
invalidated God may choose to work
through physiological disorders.
It is not simply that Mr Holbrook con-
fuses cause and effect; he seems also to
destroy his own argument. Art teaches
us how to have good married lives; an
unsatisfactory intra-uterine or pre-wean-
ing state will produce bad art and bad
people. So that it would seem that art is
useless because it can never save those
who didn't have satisfactory infantile
relationships with their mothers. Mr Hol-
brook ignores this, as he ignores so much
else. In place of argument, though, he
has a favorite word—“reality”; it is never
defined, but as it is used so indiscrimi-
nately as to become meaningless, the lack
of definition need to worry us. He has
also a number of astounding insights due
to his reading in psychology “in this,”
he writes “lies the basis of a sexual
morality based on biological truth.”
After the theoretical chapter, married
love is examined in Chaucer and Shake-
speare. There are some interesting de-
tailed criticisms of particular passages,
but the reading of Chaucer’s “Merchant's
Tale” seems totally to misunderstand
Chaucer. In his concern for his theory,
Mr Holbrook simplifies the tale of the
elderly husband, young wife, and
the lover from one in which
everybody was seen as cruel and
unpleasant not least the young
wife for cuckolding her blind
husband into one in which
the wife finds true love with the
lover a love her husband can-
not give her as he entered mar-
riage for the wrong reasons.
But the concluding half of the
book on Lawrence is worth
reading. Mr Holbrook's style is still very
clumsy; it is still full of his vogue words;
it is still full of nonsense and some very
odd psychology (“oral-anal sadism”);
and it is still woefully repetitive
and long winded. But the criticism
of “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” that
emerges from the mess is interesting
and perceptive. Lawrence's “cunning
distortion of sexual truth" is indicated—
and necessarily so, as he is recom-
mended for his sanity as a sexual
theorist; Lawrence's nonsense about the
organic community being destroyed by
the industrial revolution —thus pre-
venting people from having good
orgasms—is exposed for the nonsense
it is—again necessarily, as this is the
myth accepted by the Leavis and Thomp-
son literature and society line. It is
a pity that Mr Holbrook's book reads
like an unrevised exercise in self-
therapy, as his assertive tone, his fre-
quent crudity of thinking, can only
discourage readers.
Readers, that is, who are allowed the
book; by some grotesque irony “ I he
Quest for Love” has been banned by
the Australian Customs! That the whole
book is an attack on promiscuity, easy
sex and 20th century sexual cynicism,
that “Lady C'hatterley’s Lover"’ is
examined to be subjected to a thorough
devaluation, seems not to have been
realised by the censors. They seem
unaware, too, that the book has been
treated seriously overseas as a work of
literary criticism; it has received bad
reviews—but never has it been con-
sidered as pornographic or as corrupt-
ing. It has been attacked as all too
earnestly the reverse. I suppose the
ban is there because “Lady Chatterley”
is discussed, and certain passages are
quoted that contain rude words; or
perhaps because a famous pun on
“quaint” that occurs in Chaucer and
Andrew Marvell is here indicated. It
would need an intrepid seeker for por-
nography to read through Mr Hol-
brook's prose for excitement —but the
Customs are nothing if not intrepid
readers. Perhaps now that they have
discovered the “quaint"’ pun, we can
expect Chaucer and Marvell to be
burnt.
Creature Discomforts
All Heaven In A Rage E. S. Turner.
Michael Joseph. 38s. 6d.
The Duke of Windsor has related how,
as a youth, he accompanied his father to
a shoot at Lord Burnham’s estate in
Buckinghamshire. About 4000 phea-
sants were killed on that royal occasion,
King George himself accounting for
more than 1000. On the way home
some twinge of remorse prompted the
King to remark: “Perhaps we went a
little too far today, David.” However,
even today, many sportsmen would hotly
deny that there was anything morally
wrong about butchering a few thou-
sand birds to provide a day's sport. And
the same sportsmen might well write
furiously to "The Times” about the
starving cats in Continental alleys.
This ambivalent attitude has marked
the campaign against cruelty to animals
in Britain ever s : nce the first humani-
tarian stirrings in the 18th century. As
E. S. Turner says, the RSPCA has often
drawn support from landed gentry,
judges and politicians who see nothing
incongruous in allowing themselves to
be photographed, gun in hand, behind
ramparts of corpses. Hunters of foxes,
rabbits, badgers and even the noble
stag have always been able to claim that
they are performing a necessary job of
pest control. The argument that hunt-
ing is no more cruel than other methods
of destruct : on—by trapping or poison,
for instance—is often difficult to refute.
In less squeamish days, of course, the
rationalisation took a different form.
During the Napoleonic Wars huntsmen
argued that the frequent sight of blood

made men fitter to fight the French.
Somewhat was the same point of view
expressed in 1949 by Lord Winterton,
who said that the opponents of hunting
were “Bloomsbury boys” who loathed
the sport because it required courage
and physical fitness. (Paul Johnson, on
the other hand, was of the opinion in
1963 that “the hunting fraternity are
notoriously lascivious and, in the sea-
son, the night air of Melton Mowbray
is loud with the sighs of adulterers”.)
The killing or tormenting of birds and
beasts for sport is only one aspect of
man’s inhumanity to the “brute creation”
examined in “All Heaven In A Rage”.
It is when E. S. Turner considers the
treatment of animals to please the dic-
tates of fashion, of culinary taste or
simply of profit that the reader really
peers into the pit of hell. This is not a
book for weak stomachs, though there
is no deliberate exploitation of the grue-
some. The facts are left to speak for
themselves, and they speak plainly
enough.
We are reminded, for example, that
well into the 19th century pigs were
being whipped to death to make their
flesh more tender. Butchers went to
monstrous lengths to provide “well-
bleached” veal for epicures. (Their prac-
tice was to partly bleed the calf and
plug the wound with tow; then they fed
the dying animal with gruel to keep its
heart beating and bled it again, kicking
it or twisting its tail if the blood was
slow to flow.) Geese spent their lives
nailed to the floor through the webs of
their feet while they were crammed
with food to produce grossly-enlarged
livers. The most highly-prized salmon
was one that had been crimped—that is,
hacked into collops while alive.
When Henry Mayhew wrote his
monumental survey of London life in
the 1850 s, Cockneys were still skinning
cats alive for their fur, blinding canaries
with red-hot needles to “sweeten their
throats” and flogging their worn-out
horses to death in the streets. Against
this flood of heedless cruelty individual
reformers like “Humanity” Martin
fought a long, thankless battle before
bodies like the RSPCA aroused the
Government to legislative action.
Mr Turner, however, does not let us
become too smug about the state of
affairs today. Modern “industrial farm-
ing” in Britain, with its sweat-boxes,
bleeding-tunnels and other Orwellish
paraphernalia, is a pretty repulsive busi-
ness. And when we buy a simple com-
modity like a cake of soap we don't
reflect that the fat may well have come
from a whale killed by an explosive
harpoon. “Blow a hole in a man,
anchor a rope in his wound and make
him pull a loaded barrow for an hour
or two —that is a rough comparison,”
says Mr Turner.
GEOFFREY SCOTT
Split Personalities
I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.
Hannah Green. Gollancz. 265. 6d.
There have been absorbing books about
the treatment of insanity before, from
“The Snake Pit” to “The Three Christs
of Ypsilanti”, but never anything quite
like this. Most people, even those who
have known schizophrenics, are puzzled
at just how a personality can split into
two and live in both worlds at once, the
real and the imaginary.
Hannah Green (the nom-de-plume for
a doctor or a very cured ex-patient?)
succeeds in making it all vividly under-
standable as she follows the case of the
16-year-old Deborah Blau from the day
she enters an American asylum until
her discharge three years later. It is
told so compellingly that the reader is
caught up into the monumental battle
for the girl’s mind and feels personally
involved as Dr Fried—who could recall
when “Hitler was on the other side of
the hospital's walls and not even she
could say which side was sane”—gradu-
ally pierces through the hard outer layer
of self-deception to attack the turmoil
within. Everything becomes so clear
even when Deborah burns 40 marks On
her own body with cigarettes, it is no
longer merely an incomprehensible act
but one of cruel logic . . . she is making
escape routes for her inner volcano.
Dr Fried discovers that as a child
Deborah had secretly invented her own
Kingdom of Yr (Yr probably “irr”, the
German for mad). It began as a refuge
from the searing pain of a tumor opera-
tion and from the adult lies that it would
not hurt; and from the anti-Semitism of
her schoolmates and from her own
pathetically misguided, too loving
family.
In time Yr became more tangible than
the outer world and the more her mind
retreated into it, the more her body be-
came an anaesthetised, insensitive shell,
unable to hear or see normally. Finally
the dreamland evolved into a nightmare
country full of demanding monsters:
Deborah was no longer its queen but its
slave, clamped between the collision of
her two worlds.
The doctor forces Deborah to see that
Yr is her own invention and not reality
and therefore she can choose whether to
renounce or to accept it. Moreover, she
does not lie about the choice; she does
not promise that life is a rose garden.
The hospital itself, the other patients
with their grim, black humor, the
doctors and attendants—good and bad
—and Deborah’s own family are all
drawn with compassion yet without
sentimentality, with tension but without
sensationalism.

255. 6d.
Birth of a Shark. David Wevill. Macmil-
lan. 30s. 6d.
Marianne Moore is one of the most
original poets of the century. Her poems
are as highly-wrought and mannered as
pieces of Faberge, and she has always
been able to afford to pay for her total
independence with a certain eccentricity
and remoteness. If there are times when
one feels that she can only be St John
Perse rewriting Ogden Nash, and others
when as here in “Rescue with Yul
Brynner”, she seems to be addressing
herself to too private a world, at no
point does one lose trust in her taste for
words, the elegance and style of her
phrasing, the dazzling precision of her
observations. She has a flick of the wrist
entirely her own. In “The Arctic Ox”
many of her favorite animals are on
view: the dragon, the chameleon, the
jellyfish, the giraffe, the peacock and
the dragon-fly.
C. A. Trypanis is a Greek who writes
poems in English; extremely short poems
on Byzantine and Greek themes conjure
up aspects of the past, while the opening
section of “Pompeian Dog” “Vistas”
consists of sketches of places as dif-
ferent as present-day Delos and Istanbul.
Some of these have an impressionist
delicacy.
David Wevill is a young Canadian
poet who first achieved prominence in
“Penguin Modern Poets (4).” If Mari-
anne Moore and C. A. Trypanis are both
elegants of the older generation, Wevill
is immediate, raw and disturbed. His
main preoccupation is violence and
cruelty; the theme of his book: “I know/
Health comes with facing horror”. The
sea plays an important role in his poems,
so do trapped animals, spiders and cock-
roaches. The awareness of human cruel-
ty, as well as disaster and death, is per-
vasive.
VIVIAN SMITH
Passion in Greece
The Schoolmistress with the Golden Eyes.
Stratis Myrivilis. Trans, by Philip She-
rard. Hutchinson. 31s. 6d.
Sappho, the schoolmistress of Myrivilis’
title, was the wife of Vranas, who died
terribly in hospital from multiple wounds
and gangrene as the war ended. His
friend, Leon Drivas, who had been with
him, returns in peace to the village after
one of the Turko-Greek wars following
World War I, brings her husband’s
medal and wallet to her. The curious
eyes of the Greek local people are con-
tinually upon her, watching, watching
for one false step. Drivas and his young
sister Adriani have a country house on
the edge of this village and Sappho
Vranas becomes friendly with the girl.
Gradually Sappho’s story unfolds (and
with it the clearly-seen characters of the
little town); Leon Drivas’ interest and
finally his love draws him towards her.
He is a painter, a lonely spirit driven
by the daemon of his art. Myrivilis ex-
plores the tightrope ways of love; how
it can transfigure the inner life or be-
come a devouring, possessive fire. The
imagery of the born storyteller comes
through with burning clarity and sim-
plicity, and all the characters are vividly
and often humorously drawn.
KATHLEEN MONYPENNY
War II correspondent and the wife of
an American businessman, the author
calls on full knowledge of the Baltic
campaign under Commander-in-Chief
Napier as experienced by a red-
blooded, handsome, freedom - loving
American. The difficulty of the Royal
Navy in fighting a war at the time it was
in transition between wooden and iron
ships, between sail and steam power and
between the round shot with which ,
Drake had beaten the Spanish Armada
centuries earlier and the shell gun with
which the Russians destroyed the Turk-
ish fleet at Sinope in 1853 is all con-
scientiously detailed. The last appear-
ance of Old England's wooden sea walls
on the battlefield of the ocean is
thoroughly analysed.
Two maps of the Baltic campaign and
the invincible fortress of Sveaborg help
the reader follow the travels, planned
and impromptu, of the principal charac-
ters.
“My Bad Boy”, by Margot Neville, is
a pleasant whodunit with a Sydney
background. Young and conscientious,
Olivia Tanner loves her feckless hus-
band and lives a hand-to-mouth life with
him in Elizabeth Bay. Two murders
of related wealthy neighbors, followed
by a sudden outpouring of cash from
her jobless husband, make Olivia won-
der if her bronzed mate is a competent
actor, as he and several doting feminine
friends insist he is, or if debt and penny-
pinching have made her a mean and
suspicious wife.
Olivia herself is inadvertently and
nastily involved in both murders and
between panic at her danger and the
desire to protect her husband, she tries
to rectify errors by committing further
blunders. Friends of the young couple
cleverly presented and a down-to-earth
detective-inspector who appreciates his
roast duck make for a lively interplay
of characters.
The style is relaxed, frequently witty,
and the suspense maintained from
chapter to chapter. Racehorse tips,
fabulous jewels and wads of pound
notes, as well as refreshing gin drinks
and elegant clothes create a soothing
atmosphere of well-being.

Bridging Time
A farcically opened and constructed
curve,
Our effigy bulges; each point like a nerve
Projects, interlocks, till our eager ridge
Dots on old nature this outlandish
bridge,
Shadowing all passed with its mammoth
present
For nightly performers; antipodinal
crescent,
Only full in the harbor, no body devised,
It will never be timeless or equally
prized;
Values are changing. Bridges no more
suffice;
Next link with our living will be the
device
Of tunnelling under our harbor of time
So that men may descend and presently
climb
And remember just how, no great
distance away,
They once left an ocean that remains

New Britons
Back Street. New Worlds. Elspeth Huxley.
Chatto & Windus. 325.
In Australia -there is a popular belief
that certain thrifty migrants are fond of
cat-food from tins as a sandwich spread.
In Britain, it appears, new arrivals from
the West Indies are credited with a
preference for this delicacy. Prejudice,
like migration, knows no frontiers.
Elspeth Huxley, well-known for her
books on changing Africa, has turned
her enquiring mind to an investigation
of what is happening to white and
colored minority groups in her own
country. She has not come up with any
startling revelations but she has pro-
vided us with a fascinating cross between
a basic reference work and a .series of
collective profiles. Over 1.2 million New
Britons have settled in the old island
since the end of the war, anc some of the
more dramatic consequences of this in-
flux are known to every newspaper
reader see the racial trouble which
played a part in recent by-elections. But
Miss Huxley finds that, by and large,
traditions of tolerance have stood up to
the test, even though, perhaps, somewhat
after the manner of Ben Tillett’s remark
about the Jews who reached England
from pogrom-torn Russia: “You are our
brothers and we’ll dd our duty by you,
but we wish you hadn’t come.”
With the possible exception of some
among the 150,000 Indians and Pakis-
tanis, most, if not all, of those who did
ccnr since 1945 desire to remain,
measuring their successful integration
by the speed with which they can make
themselves undetectable as alien sons.
Their example to follow in this are the
Jews, on whom the author has an enter-
taining chapter. I didn’t know that, with
less than 1 per cent of the population,
they contribute 5 per cent to the mem-
bership of the Royal Society, but I am
inclined to think Miss Huxley is too
optimistic in hoping that other commu-
nities will similarly manage to retain co-
hesion as assimilation advances. The
only other large section of early
migrants, 80,000 Huguenots in the 17th
century, have completely disappeared.
Once a year a French sermon is still
preached at Rochdale in Kent. This is all
that verifiably remains of their culture.
The biggest minority by far is the
Irish, now as in the 19th century when
over 350,000 passed through Liverpool
during and after the potato famine. El-
speth Huxley does not seem to like them
very much; at any rate she writes of
them more harshly than of the rest. She
has a weak spot for the Poles, of whom
there now are about 130,000, struggling,
with lessening effect, to hold on to their
separate identity. The problem is always
the same: the individual wants to take
on the color of his environment, while
the tribal spirit resists. Pigmentation
adds its complexity. The ones who enter
with the highest expectations are the
West Indians. They have no language
difficulties and share the natives’ re-
ligion and sport, but this has notJielped
them much. Indeed, they complain bit-
terly of discrimination and say that they
rarely feel at home in an English
church. But they, too, are probably now
reaching the conclusion that the Immi-
gration Act was not meant to keep out
colored folk, but simply to control the
rising stream of migration into a country
worse prepared for it than is Australia,
for all her haphazard methods.
Education and housing provides the
narrowest bottle-necks. It is all very
well to oppose the idea of separate re-
ception classes, but in some areas more
than 25 per cent of enrolled pupils are
from Asia and need special attention.
Nevertheless, and although there are
many strains, the schools are coping
fairly adequately. The really tough
proposition, in a land where the major-
ity of houses were built before 1919,
and where in theory there is protection
for statuary tenants, is how to put a roof
over so many new heads. Rachmanism
has become a familiar term; it’s here
that strife with the indigenous originates.
One has to live somewhere, and what can
health inspectors do when the slums are
starting to burst at the seams? There is,
however, nothing about Mosley and the
Netting Hill riots in this story and, when
the housing situation improves, friction
may eventually vanish. As fresh skills
are acquired a different, internal, migra-
tion supervenes: from Stepney to Putney,
and so on. It will be interesting to see
whether this will also apply to Negroes
. . . will they always remain lowly ser-
vants of the Transport Boards?

I will go down through the grim ground,
the grudging scrub, to the creek’s cleft,
to the pool-place plashing, held hidden,
grotesque and goddess gum graced,
in rocks’ region, its rounding reflections
widening, wave-wandering under leaves,
under lichen-green, lichen-grey ledges,
its mind’s mirror making the mind mild,
cloudless, cool, where the pool chills,
silvers, with waves wandering over
its sands, its sediment shallows, its dove-
grey dim depths, where, needle-sharp
near,
rings the rain-wrought round of the
wren.
I will go down to the pool-place

crooked cops and Teddy boys make
up the usual character list of Colin
Maclnnes’s novels. There is an attempt
by the publishers to persuade us with
the quotations on the back of each
volume that these books have a docu-
mentary value. “Absolute Beginners”
is supposed to be worth “five hundred
pamphlets, reports, or summer-school
proceedings on the subject of British
youth”. “Mr Love and Justice” is
described as “a penetrating, riveting,
and convincing analysis of the relation-
ship between the criminal and the
Force”.
I don't believe a word of it. “June in
Her Spring”, unhappily set in our own
country, represents the unthinking
Englishman's idea of Australia. Externally
accurate (to a point) in its record of life
on the stations with the peculiar intimacy
of neighbors who are dozens of miles
apart, it completely fails to bring a single
character to life. A few ill-chosen
Aussie idioms (‘"dinkie-die”, “bonzer”,
“too-roo” and other expressions like
“bontosher” which, thank heaven, I
have never heard) are quite unable to
sustain the stilted, improbable dialogue.
“City of.Spades” deals with African
and West Indian immigrants in London.
With unusual conviction Maclnnes por-
trays the “spades” as arrogant, selfish
and completely untouched by such
generosity and friendliness as they are
offered.
Negroes are seen rather more sym-
pathetically through the eyes of an
18-year-old freelance photographer (spe-
cialising in pornographic pictures to
order) in “Absolute Beginners”. The
photographer’s involvement in the Not-
ting Hill Gate riots provides a climax
of sorts tq much aimless wandering
through the sleazy parts of London.
The final novel in the group is the
most technically accomplished. It takes
up the alternating viewpoint tentatively:
and pointlessly introduced in “City of
Spades”. Here the two third-person
narratives are alternated with definite
purpose (crude as it is) and not just as
a gimmick.
This structure juxtaposes the careers
of a young constable entering the vice
squad and an out-of-work sailor taking
a post as a whore’s protector. From the
opening, apparently unconnected chap-
ters one anticipates that these two will
eventually make a fateful conjunction,
and the resulting suspense gives the
book a cohesion which the earlier ones
lack.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Gold Drain Continues
Although the US Government
has removed the 25 p.c. gold
backing for the Federal Reserve
banking system and instructed its
bankers to keep a restraint on capital
outflow, pressure on gold still remains.
The worst aspect of this pressure
is that various banking groups through-
out Europe apparently are quietly con-
verting more currency into gold “as
a precaution”, but are doing it dis-
creetly, mainly through London.
As a result, the Bank of England
has been required to release substantial
quantities of gold from the central
bankers’ gold pool. Since the US has
a 50 p.c. stake in this central bankers’
pool, the burden falls heavily on Fort
Knox. The rest of the gold pool was
supplied originally by European
central bankers, who put gold into the
kitty in exchange for dollars. With
the current tendency to convert these
dollars into gold in New York (notably
by France), the US has to stand
behind the gold standard more or less
as backer of last resort.
America expects to free five billion
dollars of gold by the legislation to
remove the 25 p.c. certified gold re-
serve backing which the Federal Re-
serve banks were required to maintain
against the commercial bank deposits
they held. This move was designed to
convince the world that America
would meet all demands on gold. It
came at a time when reserves had
dropped below 15 billion dollars for
the first time since March, 1939, and
when 1965 losses already were three
times as large as the total drain for
1964.
In Europe, at the moment, it is not
regarded as cricket or baseball to ask
for a conversion of currencies into
gold, as it would embarrass America.
It might also embarrass certain foreign
aid appropriations being decided in
Washington. Therefore it is more
diplomatic and discreet for European
central banks to buy gold in London
or elsewhere, rather than apply directly
to the Federal Reserve Bank in
America.
If London reserves decline (in-
fluenced even in part by “buy-back”
operations of European bankers), the
strength of sterling could become more
a matter of whether America is pre-
pared to bolster it indefinitely with a
supply of gold.
The influential factor is that any
devaluation of sterling might touch off
a rash of devaluations, thus placing
undue pressure on the dollar.
America’s moves to protect its
balance of payments have been in-
terpreted as a form of exchange con-
trol and have raised further agitation

JL Britain showed up on the financial
front when seasonal bank advances for
two months to February (when tax
paying demands are heavy) rose by
only £stgloom. compared “With
£stglsom. in the previous two years.
Investment programmes are ex-
pected to suffer and the squeeze in
business has aroused fears of a more
pronounced downturn in the economy
as the year progresses. This is in sharp
contrast to American manufacturing
industry, where an extension of tax
concessions on plant depreciation has
enabled manufacturers to breathe a
sigh of relief.
Since 1962, businessmen in America
have been encouraged to modernise
their plant because of fast depreciation
write-downs for tax purposes. No
supervision was made to see if US
plant operators actually were buying
new equipment as fast as they claimed
on their tax returns.
In fact, after the three-year transi-
tional period which ends this year, the
US Treasury claims that more than
half the firms which elected the fast
write-offs of plant would be unable to
justify them. The tax requirements
relating to the three-year transitional
period have been relaxed and the
transitional period extended to 12
years.
The tax rules relating to write-offs
will be tightened in each year, but 95
p.c. of the corporations involved in a
likely tax slug this year have been
reprieved.
Hence further encouragement to
buy new plant and keep things moving.
Worry over Steel
With Australia forced to watch over-
seas economic events more closely
now that the battle for the balance of
payments is intensifying, it may come
as a surprise to know that the
Americans are more concerned about
the threat of a steel strike than any
other factor which might affect the
boom.
Steel output is rising strongly to
peak levels with the automotive in-
dustry and others building up a stock-
pile for fear of a strike.
If the strike does not eventuate,
many users will have two or three
months’ supply of steel in stock, with
a consequent downturn in future buy-
ing orders.

If a strike occurs this year, the new
St Lawrence Seaway, due to open in
April, is expected to cheapen the
freight costs of any steel imports from
Europe.
On the West Coast, BHP would be
competing with Japan for markets
but, at this stage, there is some ques-
tion about the quantities which BHP
could export because the company

already is importing billets from Japan
to feed its sted lolling mill.
There does seem to be some chance
that the almost traditional steel strike
may be averted. The United Steel-
workers’ Union has been asked to post-
pone the May 1 deadline for the strike
(mainly because of its still contested
presidential election). Any breather
could give time for further negotia-
tion.

Judging by the huge outflow of
funds which occurred before February
10, 1965 (when restrictions were an-
nounced), plenty of people beat the
gun.
The local worry now is that over-
seas companies may compete with
local companies in fund raising on the
Australian market and also create
further problems by remitting divi-
dends to the USA. General Motors
president Mr J. F. Gordon said no
change was contemplated in GM-H

funds would need to be raised and
that GM-H’s export earnings were
expected to rise to £9m. this year and
thus were expected to cover dividend
commitment, which was £8.17m. in
1963.
Send-home Pay
With a high volume of unemploy-
ment in Italy, Italian workers
have been pouring into Common Mar-
ket countries to seek jobs. They have
been welcome additions to the labor
force in such countries. Australia, too,
has been gaining a high percentage of
Italians from its immigration pro-
gramme.
But they arc causing embarrassment
to Switzerland, where half a million
Italians are working and sending
money home. Under new Swiss con-
trols, only foreign workers with signed
contracts are now permitted to enter
the country. Something like 100,'000
seasonal workers who normally seek
work in Switzerland at this time of the
year are being turned back at the
border, with consequent protests from
Italy.
It seems hard to imagine Switzer-
land with a balance of payments prob-
lem, yet if 500,000 Italians send'
home the equivalent of £lO a week,
that’s £sm. a week. The country has
imposed credit restrictions on its banks
since March, 1964, partly because too
much money was being invested in a
building boom, causing land prices to
rocket. With interest on foreign funds
going out of Switzerland, together with
a sizeable slice of the pay packets, the
Government clamped down.
Other countries may need to take
a closer look at this flight of wages
when analysing balance of payments
figures. Australia has always main-
tained a fairly tight control over the
amount of money a person can send
abroad each week. But as migrant
families increase in numbers and size,
the potential outgoings can become sub-
stantial.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Lowering the Liquidity Boom
Precipitate measures must be avoided
IjyiTHOUT calling it a credit squeeze the
" •-business jworld is beginning to accept
the fact that money has tightened and is
going to get increasingly tighter in the
next few months. This will put to stern
test the credit industry’s arrangements
to keep full employment going in a
seasonal period of stringent liquidity.
While a rundown in liquidity is
normal at this season of the year, there
can be little doubt that this year’s is
going to be of bigger proportions than
fdr many years and will impose what the
Bank of New South Wales in its latest
Review calls an “altogether dispro-
portionate strain on the financial arrange-
ments of business and individuals”.
Stringency symptoms have been show-
ing for some time. For instance,
although the £2l million undersubscrip-
tion to the February Commonwealth
loan can possibly be attributed more to
the recent sudden drop in savings banks
deposits, which cut back subscriptions
from that quarter, and also to the with-
holding, notably by short-term sub-
scribers, of funds in expectation of
higher interest rates in the next loan,
these are themselves indicative of the
growing tightness of money. The run-
down of funds in the short-term money
market in recent weeks is another. Again,
the expected seasonal fall in bank
advances is in full swing and this seems
also to be reflecting Dr Coombs’ in-
junction to the banks last October to cut
back on new lending commitments.
As to the continuing decline in share
prices, this is also symptomatic, though
there are several influences at work here
and their relative significance is not easy
to assess. Selling for tax purposes has
started and may gather pace. That is
normal for this time of the year and
could be heavier than usual. Further,
although the most likely period for a
supplementary Budget has passed, Dr
Coombs is still in position to inflict a
monetary wound.
The market is also keeping a close eye
on the balance of payments and especially
upon the impact of high imports on it.
Worries about sterling, which is ad-
mittedly in a healthier position than a
few months ago but still not out of the
wood, also persist.
Many brokers came away from the
Melbourne Stock Exchange’s recent
symposium on Investment in Australia
with a conviction that portfolio invest-
ment from overseas can hardly be ex-
pected to give the market much of a lift
in the coming months. This is despite
Mr Shanks’ view that there would be an
increase in the flow from Britain, taking
a two years’ view. The cut-off from
America will be indefinitely prolonged
and Europe is apparently not very
interested.
Even in face of evidence from com-
pany interim reports that overall in-
dustrial profits are continuing to rise,
albeit somewhat more slowly than last
year, there is probably enough in the
above influences to make investors
cautious of the market's prospects. For
although the indexes are down consider-
ably they are still historically high.
Of more immediate importance for
share prices, the market is laboring under
the weightiest capital-raising task for
companies it has been called on to
shoulder for many a long day. This is
both diverting buying attention from
listed shares and bringing in substantial
selling to get funds to take up new issues.
R. HOLDER
It is estimated that new issues for about
£4O million new money will have to be
digested in the next few months, a heavy
task indeed in the economy’s tightest
season for liquidity. The undertaking
will have wide constricting repercussions
on the general availability of money.
So while the drift in the share market
may well be reflecting an overall tighten-
ing of funds, in a sense the shortage there
is also relative to the growing supply of
scrip.
The current general drain on liquidity
is of course to be explained partly by
the usual seasonal effects of the balance
of overseas payments and these in them-
selves threaten to be heavy because of
the likelihood of there being visible trade
deficits in the coming months. On the
other hand, the Bank of New South
Wales’ economist, Mr R. F. Holder, has
shown in the Review that these will be
greatly aggravated by the ebbs and flows
of Federal Government finance.
As I argued at the time of the last
Budget, it was not to be expected that
Mr Holt’s supposed restraining influence
on the economy through his estimated
£18.6 million deficit would at any rate
be felt in the first half of the year. It
now turns out that the Federal cash
deficit at the half-way stage this year was
£72.4 million more than for the first half
of 1963-64, that is £205.4 million as
against £133 million. Thus it is evident
that the net impact of the Budget up
to December 31 last was anything but
restraining.
But what is in prospect? If the
Treasurer is to realise his Budget surplus,
this half of the year the net effect of
Treasury operations on liquidity will be
one of disproportionate drain. True, the
drain will be mitigated to the extent that,
facing an unwilling loan market, the
Treasurer may opt, or even be forced,
to forgo the luxury of a surplus. Doubt-
less, even if the February loan was a
flop, he will try all the harder to make
up lost ground in the May loan, possibly
by increasing interest rates. In the
probable strained liquidity conditions to
be expected in May his chances wouldn’t
be rated very high. So he could finish
up with a cash deficit and, although not
many people would probably agree, this
would probably not be inappropriate to
the circumstances now emerging.
It has to be remembered that while last
August a Budget surplus was obviously
necessary to moderate liquidity and
prevent the economy running hot, the
Treasury has let too much money out of
the bag in the first half of the year and
to get it back again will be an uncom-
fortable business economy. Per-
haps by the next Budget the Treasurer
will have thought of some new tricks
to match the seasonal flows of funds in
and out of the Treasury more evenly.
One of the troubles, as the ’Wales
points out, is that the pay-as-you-go
machinery, which was an early step to
this end, seems now to work the other
way. The general steady collection of
tax payments by this means goes on, but
the refunds magnify the Federal Govern-
ment’s deficit in the first part of the year.


Again, the introduction of Treasury
Notes offered companies and the other
large taxpayers a vehicle for short-term
provisions against tax liabilities, but sales
of these have been particularly poor this
year.
As a new step the ’Wales thinks the
Treasury should introduce special tax
payment certificates on attractive terms
to meet the needs of taxpayers. This
could help matters, but, above all, what
seems most required is a rearrangement
of the loan-raising programme in an
effort to collect more in the first half of
the year to match more closely the flow
of Government expenditure.
Another idea, put up last year by Dr
R. F. Henderson, Director of the In-
stitute of Economic Research at Mel-
bourne University, would be tb introduce
tap loans to replace the periodic issues
of Commonwealth loans during the
year. As The Bulletin explained in its
issue of December 5, 1964, this system,
which is used in Britain, has numerous
other advantages over the Australian
method of raising Government loans.
While the Treasury may well search
for new means to obviate its finances
having jerky and undesirable impacts on
the economy, industry and business has
to face up here and now to the strains
of the uneven seasonal Treasury flows
this year. Things being what they are
here the banks cannot be expected to
provide much solace from their reducing
liquidity ratios. As we have seen, Dr
Coombs’ injunctions to them last October
to reduce new lending are in any case
calculated to pinch the business world
at this season. This could provide a
Roman holiday for fringe financiers, to
whom the lending field is still wide open.
The situation is mildly reminiscent of
early 1961, though not aggravated as it
was then by harsh impositions from fiscal
and monetary policies, nor, as yet, by
any noticeable contraction of • trade
credit, which greatly bedevilled the peace
in the autumn of that year.
Even so it is noticeable that, as
mentioned above, the increase in savings
has slowed down appreciably (savings
bank deposits rose only £7.5 million in
January compared with £17.5 million the
same month last year). If this trend
continues it could play havoc with the
supply of money going into Government
loans and also housing. Also a slight
waning in business confidence can be
detected here and there. It behoves the
fiscal and monetary authorities to
recognise this and to avoid precipitate
measures which might further damage
this most tender of plants, the full
employment garden.
CROESUS
Challenges to the Exchanges
Final words on the Melbourne symposium
/Challenges to the stock exchanges
came from . everywhere at the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange’s symposium on
Investment in Australia. But hardly
noticing the skirmishes in the aisles and
even on the rostrum, Mr A. B. Mellor, the
local chairman, kept admirably to his
prepared course like a policeman in a
maddening crowd, suggesting that the
status quo was good, that it was improv-
ing and would be very much better later
on when all the moves the committee had
afoot were home and hosed.
As revealed in his paper, Mr Mellor's
conceptions of the challenges seemed to
be somewhat narrow, certainly so com-
pared, say, with those of Mr Macindoe,
who had raised the Southern Cross roof
the previous day, and also even compared
with those of the institutional investor,
represented by Dr A. H. Pollard of the
MLC, and of accountants like Professor
R. J. Chambers of Sydney University
who nailed many of Sir Alexander Fitz-
gerald's crosses for him when he spoke
at the end of the symposium.
When Mr C. T. Looker, in putting up a
stout defence for the exchanges against
Mr Macindoe's charges, almost suggested
the self-enterprising stockbrokers had had
greatness in the national sense thrust upon
them, he was in fact setting the stage for
'Mr Mellor to show what the exchanges
had done from small yet honest begin-
nings until the present era when, in his
words, they are “answerable to the
nation" and must measure up to their
responsibilities as “an integral part of the
economic structure”.
Mr Mellor wasn't looking for trouble,
at least not of the Macindoe variety. Most
of the'steam had been let off the day be-
fore and his critics, as we shall see, were
inclined to probe deeper than the dis-
contents on commissions, alleged conflicts
of interests manifest in broker-director-
ships and broker-underwriters, wily cir-
culars, inspired turnovers, monopoly,
false markets, frequency of company re-
porting, partiality in the stock exchanges’
treatment of listed companies arid the rest
which Mr Looker had to deal with.
The challenges, as Mr Mellor saw
them, can be grouped under these heads.
First, there was the obligation to the
nation and the economy, already men-
tioned. Then there was the challenge to
provide “an efficient and orderly market”,
that is “to facilitate purchases and sales.”
(Although Mr Mellor, as a broker, saw
the stock exchange as being primarily “a
market place”, his overall assessment of
its basic function was not very different
from Dr Pollard's, “the mobilising of the
‘idle’ savings of the community by others
who seek to put them to active use”.)
Again, there were family matters such
as rules for members, qualifications for
membership and generally keeping the
play clean. Lastly, there was the general
challenge to ensure the protection of the
investing public.
Success in serving the nation and the
economy would depend on achievement
under the other three heads. It wasn’t
difficult for Mellor to satisfy his audience
on moves already made and in prospect to
ensure an efficient and orderly market.
He mentioned some of the directions in
which progress has been made in the last
fifteen years. These include the introduc-
tion of post trading, telephones on the
trading floor, investment services, various
new share indices, “odd lot” specialists
and the gradual (still too ■gradual!) speed-
ing up of transfers and delivery of scrip.
He foresaw early legislation to streamline
security transfers and stamp duty collec-
tion and the introduction of EDP equip-
ment in Melbourne as installed already
in Sydney. None of this was hot news,
though it shows what the exchanges have
done and are doing to improve their effi-
ciency and so meet this particular
challenge.
Equally Mr Mellor projected a pretty
clean sheet on family and related matters,
though the previous day's charges that
stock exchange committees are not invari-
ably impartial in their treatment of com-
panies nor in the selection of members
were not answered. He threw out a hint
that Melbourne was considering introduc-
ing non-member partners as Sydney has
done and that it is also examining means
for improving stockbrokers’ audit.
Mr Mellor ran on to more contentious
ground, discussing the role played by the
exchanges in the protection of the inves-
tor. This involved “not only providing as
pure a form of competition as possible in
the actual mechanics of the market but
also the responsibility to ensure that com-
panies in whose securities trading was
permitted observed specified procedures
to inform shareholders and the public at
large of matters pertaining to the particu-
lar companies.”
Sheltering under a statement that “the
Australian Associated Stock Exchanges-
consider that disclosure of all relevant
information is of paramount importance”,
Mr Mellor seemed to cut most of the
corners in his defence of the new listing
requirements brought out last September.
On the question of interim accounting,
which so far the exchanges have shied at,
he merely threw the ball into the court of

CC4.53.25
Dr A. H. POLLARD
“directors, accountants and other com-
mercial professions”, who deem it of
.doubtful wisdom.
All he had to say further on the sub-
ject of protection was that the stock
exchanges were at least ahead of the
legislatures in Australia in matters of
disclosure by listed companies and that
“this question of disclosure has been
and surely must always be a basic tenet of
the free enterprise system and, in
particular, the security industry itself”.
This broad official stock exchange view
seemed a little tame after the more
penetrating and detailed observations on
disclosure at the symposium.
As an institutional investor, Dr Pol-
lard had two main complaints. One was
that, although the exchanges provide a
“real” market for ordinary shares, he
deplored the absence of a real market
in fixed interest securities, blaming this
not so much on the stock exchanges,
though, as on companies.
As he said, many front-rank com-
panies will not list their fixed interest
securities on the stock exchange because
the market is too “thin”, resulting in the
prices shown being unrealistic and, in
the opinion of their management, a re-
flection on their borrowing status. From
the point of view of the debenture
holder this is unfortunate.
Many investors would like to invest for
comparatively long terms in fixed interest
securities if they could feel sure that in
a liquidity emergency they were able to
realise on the securities at a “fair”
valuation. At the present time debentures
(with the exception of a few such as
those of BHP and CSR) cannot be re-
garded as a liquid investment and this
must be a factor limiting the flow of
funds to suitable enterprises.
Many companies follow the practice
of raising large amounts by the issue of
a prospectus at irregular intervals. As a
consequence, subscribers only have the
opportunity of investing in large lumps at
irregular intervals and frequently at in-
convenient times. Both borrower and
lender would generally prefer to deal in
smaller amounts but more frequently. In
Dr Pollard's view, the development of an
efficient fixed interest market should make
this possible and would thus enable
larger funds to be made available for
entrepreneurial activity and would at the
same time, by increasing their liquidity,
add financial strength to both institutional
and private funds.
Dr Pollard's other big complaint con-
cerned the inequity of commissions
charges to the institutions. Through the
principle of averaging charges as between
small and big clients, he said, the large
institutional client is being forced to pay
more than his equitable share of brokers’
administrative expenses so that the small
client need pay less than his share and
also so that the small client may receive
technical advice (which the institutions
can usually provide themselves). He
thought that “perhaps it is in the social
interest that the load should be carried
by those best able to bear it, but the in-
equity of present brokerage charges
should be looked at again"’.
He thinks the amalgamation of small
firms and the development of non-mem-
her partners with technical qualifications
could be the solution to ensure that the
client gets value for his money.
Dr Pollard also suggested the exchanges
should look more closely at the scope for
rigging markets, for instance by the
spreading of rumors and also prior to
placements and off-market deals, but at
the same time admitted the exchanges
have only limited practical scope to dis-
cipline companies. The ultimate sanc-
tion of delisting was against the interests
of shareholders, he said.
Professor Chambers was also con-
cerned about the obvious scope for false
markets and, while approving the ex-
changes’ drive to get more frequent and
fuller disclosure of information from
companies, he took the line Sir Alexander
Fitzgerald had developed at an earlier
session of the symposium to expose the
per se inadequacy of company accounts
which “add the unaddable and compare
the non-comparable - ’ as a guide to the
w'orth of shares. He saw no reason why
companies could not be made to con-
form with uniform rules for the deriva-
tion of comparable financial informa-
tion for the better conduct of securities
markets. In a word, he ridiculed the
whole basis of market valuation of com-
pany shares and on that strange note the

Implement makers reap their reward
Australia’s rural exports for 1964-65
are certain to be lower than the
previous year, both in volume and mone-
tary value, yet farm implement makers
still face an unprecedented demand
and a headache. In many cases manu-
facturers and suppliers are unable to
meet orders. Despite the number of com-
panies engaged in the farm implement
business, there appears to be a condition
of undersupply.
Whatever worries the tractor makers
may feel in introducing their new models
(see “Man on the Land”, page 80), a
succession of good seasons has helped to
keep farmers fairly happy and prosper-
ous. Specialised implements have also
come on to the market and these, in
some cases, obviate the necessity for
manual labor.
Two developments on this side of agri-
culture particularly are the cotton picker
and the cane cutter. Generally speaking
the move in Australia is to bigger im-
plements to enable more ground to be
covered in a working day. In “Farmers
Using More Tractors” (The Bulletin,
August 22, 1964, pp. 57, 58) the increase
in tractor power to handle the bigger
implements was discussed.
A significant part of our implement
requirements is imported, although
figures on this and the local production
are not available. The opinion expressed
in the industry is that both imports and
local production have been rising strongly
over the past three or four years. Most
of the specialised implements are
imported. Cotton pickers, planting equip-
ment and combine harvesters are a few
examples.
Most of the companies The Bulletin
spoke to felt that the drought, now being
experienced over a wide part of NSW,
would have little or no effect on sales.
They feel farmers are looking further
ahead than the next rains, and even their
current income, and will buy equipment
while they can.
An executive of one company
described the demand for agricultural
implements as “excellent”. The cereal-
growing situation is particularly buoyant.
Acreages under wheat have been increas-
ing every year and so have the yields
per acre. This year has been very stable
as far as ploughing, sowing and harvest-
ing conditions are concerned. Of course
there are other factors to consider, too:
things like the depreciation allowance
have helped tremendously.
“With the farmer able to write off 120
p.c. of his tractor and implements in five
years (he is allowed to claim 20 p.c. of
the cost and 20 p.c. depreciation in the
first year and 20 p.c. for four years
thereafter), there is a greater turnover of
tractors and machinery. While seasons
continue to be good he is also encouraged
to change equipment more often.
“The drought in NSW will affect us
only in the coastal districts, but I expect
that the business we lose there will be
taken up in other areas. However, if
they get rain on the coast shortly our
sales of fodder machinery will not
slacken.”
An executive of International Har-
vester, one of the two main, implement
manufacturers in Australia, said
that Australia’s full employment had
resulted in a large overtime bill for his
company. “Last year our employees
(there are between 4500 and 5000)
worked more than one million overtime
hours, or 200 overtime hours each. This
covers all of our divisions, of course,
trucks, tractors and construction, but as
tractors and implements are the second
biggest part of our business there was a
goodly-sized overtime bill there. The
manpower shortage caused the large bill
and we had to bear most of it. We were
forced to take the increased costs to keep
faith with the farmer and the dealer. In
return there was no additional income
for us.
“It’s a reflection of just how good the
market for tractors and implements is
at the moment. Business is extremely
buoyant at present.
(In the tractor story previously men-
tioned in this article, the International
executive said the company’s tractor
division at Geelong had been working
three shifts a day, seven days a week for
eight or nine months. This position has
apparently not changed.)
“The current situation stems mainly
from the expansion of wheat and the past
good seasons,” the International Har-
vester spokesman continued. “A growing
cotton industry, too, has provided us
with excellent sales of both tillage and
picking equipment. The two cotton pro-
jects (a) Wee Waa in northern NSW and
in the Riverina) will continue to grow
and so will the demand for equipment.
In the forthcoming picking season
(April-May-June) we will sell about 40
pickers. We have more than 90 p.c. of
the picker business in NSW.”
Another major Australian implement
manufacturer, Chamberlain Industries,
which is based in Western Australia, is
experiencing similar boom conditions.
NSW State manager Mr T. R. Lund said
the company produced only tillage equip-
ment —14 and 18 disc ploughs, a seed
box attachment, a scarifier and a chisel
plough. “Last year we sold 4386 disc
ploughs in Australia, but this year the
figure will exceed 5000.
“The market has doubled in four years.
The swing in Australia is towards
mechanisation and precision equipment.
We sent a questionnaire to 5000 farmers
asking them what they expected of and
desired most in a combine seeder. The
results are now being put through a
computer. We’ve had a combine in the
field for three years and the final touches
will be made when the results of the
questionnaire are known.

until we found the optimum cutting
angle, so quite a lot of research goes into
implements before they go on the land.
By getting the right angle on the disc
plough and building it so that it needs
lubrication only once a year, the farmer
is able to cover twice the ground he
could before with another plough and
similar horsepower.
“We export some of our tractors and
implements, but not a lot. Right now the
Australian market is absorbing every-
thing we make. We have developed an
overseas market which we are just keep-
ing ticking the nucleus is already
formed and ready to expand when we
can supply it.
“At the moment we are selling about
two-and-a-third times as many im-
plements as tractors, but we haven’t gone
outside the tillage field into harvesting
or something else because other people
are already in that field.”
A newcomer to the agricultural im-
plement scene is L. A. Armstrong Pty
Ltd, of Sydney, which was previously
engaged in the supply of earthmoving
equipment. Under an agreement reached
12 months ago with Towner of America,
L. A. Armstrong is ;o produce, under
the name Towner-Armstrong, a range
of light, medium and heavy disc ploughs,
capable of cutting, at present, swathes
from 12 to 24 feet wide.
A spokesman for the company said
bigger horsepower tractors had neces-
sitated the use of bigger implements in
order to achieve optimum efficiency.
“Until five years ago heavy-duty tractors
were in the 50 to 60 horsepower class.
Now that they’re up into 100 to 110 h.p.,
there is a definite need for matched im-
plements.
“With our broad acre farming the need
for machinery to make wider cuts is
growing fast.”
An executive of one foreign-head-
quartered tractor and implement maker
said he believed there would be a
stabilisation in the tractor and equip-
ment industry after the end of the cur-
rent financial year. “By then the agri-
cultural industry will have had a chance
to take stock of the year’s results but
even though our income from rural
produce will be down I see no reason
for a slackening off in sales. While
incomes may drop I don't think they’ll
subside to the level where the man on
the land is precluded from buying new
equipment.
“Since the end of last year the market
has slowed down a lot but is still
extremely buoyant. At the moment we
are able to meet any demand comfort-
ably, but this is the first time in 12 to
18 months that we have been able to
do so. If there is any further slowing
down in the market I think it will be
due to the usual conditions—economic
and seasonal,” the executive added.


Reducing Australia’s Wheat Acreage
Has it become a national necessity?
By E. J. DONATH
(Lecturer in Marketing of Rural Products in the Australian Institute of Export
and at the University of Melbourne.)
Australia’s practically completed
wheat harvest for 1964-65 has
established three important records
■—for production, yield per acre, and
surplus for export. A blessed harvest is
always highly welcome, yet serious
students of the wheat industry have
strong misgivings about some of these
records, especially the tremendous in-
crease in acreage. Any suggestion of
reducing Australia’s wheat acreage is
regarded as highly controversial for a
number of reasons, among them a
sincere apprehension about reducing pro-
duction of “the staff of life” in a world
crying out for more food.
The officially estimated 1964-65 wheat
production of 380 million bushels is the
first of the three impressive records.
Pre-war, our average annual production
was 165 million bushels, and in the
1950 s it was about ten million bushels
higher. However, the average of the
first five harvests in the 1960 s is well
over 300 million bushels. Wheat pro-
duction has nearly doubled since pre-
war.
Before the recent “wheat bonanza”,
the highest average for a five-year period
was 194 million bushels in 1947-48-
1951-52. Even in the “grow more
wheat” campaign period of the Great
Depression it was only 186 million
bushels and this includes 1930-31, the
year of Australia’s largest wheat acreage.
Without doubt Australia has had a run
of bountiful wheat harvests, since the
average of the last five crops is over
fifty per cent higher than that of any
other previous five-year period. Can we
continue with “wheat production un-
limited”? Where is the nigger in the
woodpile?
nFHE second, highly laudable record is
the officially estimated yield per
acre of 21.3 bushels, more than half a
bushel larger than the previous record
six years ago. In the 1930 s the yield per
acre was 12.5 bushels and in the 1950 s
it was 17.1 bushels. The average yield of
the first five crops of the 1960 s is 19.4
bushels. It has been calculated that the
average yield per acre in the 1960 s wilt
be well over 20 bushels, a great and
highly praiseworthy increase in the pro-
ductivity of our wheatlands. The credit
must go to Australia’s 55,000 wheat-
growers for their better farming tech-
niques and to the wheat-breeders for
improved wheat varieties. Clover-ley
and medic-ley farming is spreading
steadily and superphosphate is applied
in increasing quantities, partly due to
the Commonwealth Government’s £3 a
ton subsidy. Nitrogenous fertilisers
may soon be used over large areas of
our wheat belt, which will further boost
the yield per acre. Australia’s yield per
acre might soon be comparable with
those of Canada and the United States.
Wheat yields per acre in Britain and on
the European Continent are more than
double ours —the result of highly inten-
sive- farming on small holdings.
Some districts here had amazingly
high yields; for example, the Victorian
Wimmera where about 25 million bushels
were harvested due to a record yield of
nearly 30 bushels an acre. Similar high
average yields per acre were achieved in
a number of districts in New South
Wales. For comparison it should be
noted that the cost of production
(guaranteed for about 210 million
bushels) is officially based on a yield of
17 bushels an acre. In view of this com-
mendable increase in the productivity of
our wheatlands, the current immense
expansion in wheat acreage seems all
the more questionable to many people
concerned about the future of one of
our largest industries.
The third record established by the
current harvest is the amount of surplus
production for export. It is the first
time that a crop yielded a surplus of
300 million bushels for export. Pre-war,
Australia averaged an annual export of
about 100 million bushels and about the
same amount was exported annually in
the 19505. The first time that our wheat
export exceeded 200 million bushels was
1961-62. Only three years later the Aus-
tralian Wheat Board has the herculean
task of selling 300 million bushels over-
seas. This comes at a time when the
world wheat market has changed from a
sellers’ market to a very strong buyers’
market.
Despite continuous sales to China and
a rather unexpected contract for 28
million bushels to the Soviet Union, it
would be a great selling achievement
even for our highly efficient Wheat
Board to place much more than 200 of
the 300 million bushels on the world
market. In other words, about 100
million bushels, or one-third of our
export surplus, will remain unsold in
silos at the end of 1965; such a tremen-
dous carry-over will be another record
in our wheat annals, but a most unwel-
come one. This corollary to our in-
creasing wheat harvests is the main rea-
son for the suggestion to reduce wheat
acreage. Surely Australia does not want to
have burdensome, unsaleable wheat
stocks like the United States of America
has had for a number of years!
has been fortunate that the
recent expansion of wheat acreage
coincided with a sellers’ market in inter-
national wheat trade during the first half
of the 19605. Increases in the amount
of wheat entering international trade
were due to the emergence o Communist
China as an annual buyer of about 5
million tons, and also to poor harvests
in some important wheat-growing areas
such as North Africa, Western Europe,
Japan, Argentina, Brazil, and especially
the Soviet Union and some Eastern
European Communist countries. It is
highly unlikely that such a combination
of factors will recur in the second half
of the 19605.
World wheat production in 1964-65
(excluding mainland China) has been
estimated at a record 240 million tons,
or nearly ten p.c. higher than the average
for the previous five years. Correspond-
ingly, it has been estimated that world
wheat trade in 1964-65 will decline to
about 46 million tons, or nearly twenty
p.c. less than a year ago. And 1964-65
will be the first time when the Aus-
tralian Wheat Board has the unenviable
task of selling more than 8 million tons,
compared with less than 3 million tons
in the 19505!
There has been a remarkably slow
increase in world wheat consumption
over the past decade. Although world
population increased by nearly 20 p.c.,
the increase in world wheat consumption

was less than 15 p.c. On the whole,
population seems to be increasing faster
in the rice and maize-eating parts of
the world than in the wheat-eating areas.
In many countries with rising living
standards wheat consumption per person
has been increasing; in many “affluent”
countries, such as Australia and the
United States, wheat consumption per
person has been declining for several
years. In Australia, during the past five
years, total flour consumption has
declined by nearly three p.c. although
population has increased by about one
million. We must not make the mistake
of assuming that an increase in popula-
tion necessarily results in a correspond-
ing increase in wheat consumption.
Commercial sales of wheat in the second
half of the 1960 s are expected to in-
crease only very slowly. Australia has
been particularly fortunate because its
commercial exports have been increasing
in the post-war period much faster than
those of most other wheat exporting
countries.
The amoun. of wheat entering inter-
national trade has increased by about 30
p.c. in the past decade; Australia’s export
has increased from an annua! average of
about 100 million bushels in the 1950 s
to well over 200 million bushels in the
19605. Whilst world trade in wheat has
increased by about 30 p.c., our export
has increased by about 100 p.c. And
this year we are trying tc unload 300
million bushels on the world market,
a year in which our keenest competitor,
the Argentine, has also had a record
crop! Small wonder that the bottom has
fallen out of the world wheat market
and that a “world wheat price war” has
drastically reduced overseas prices.
Currently, Australian wheat is offered
in London at prices 12i p.c. lower than
a year ago or about Is. 3d. a bushel less
than the guaranteed price set by the
Commonwealth Government on 150
million bushels of this year’s export. Tax-
payers will again have to subsidise wheat
export heavily.
"P\espite the comparatively small crops
during the 19505, Australia had huge
carry-overs in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1959
and 1960. A very poor harvest in
1957-58, the sudden tremendous pur-
chases by China (amounting to nearly
400 million bushels) and some recent
“windfall sales” enabled Australia to
export all of these huge surpluses in the
early 19605. At the end of 1964 we had
a minimum carry-over of about 20 mil-
lion bushels. But at the end of 1965
Australia will have a record carry-over
of about 100 million bushels—a fact
which contributes considerably to de-
clining world prices.
Australian Government authorities
have accused Canada of starting a gen-
eral lowering of wheat prices by its re-
cent sales to Communist China. Canada,
on the other hand, accuses Australia,
France and the Argentine of starting
the wheat price war by selling to the
Soviet Union at far below current Lon-
don wheat prices. Be that as it may, the
people in the two Communist countries
can laugh up their sleeves while they eat
cheap bread subsidised by taxpayers of
capitalist countries.
Australia’s wheat acreage, from which
the current record harvest is taken off,
is officially estimated at about 17.8 mil-
lion, a post-war record. The highest
acreage before the present bonanza was
13.9 million in 1948-49. Only once in
the history of Australia's wheatgrowing
was the acreage larger and that was the
“grow-more-wheat” year of 1930-31,
when it was about 400,000 acres larger.
According to current fallowing it has
been forecast that 1965-66’s acreage will
exceed even that of 1930-31. It appears
that our “wheat production unlimited”
outlook will soon result in an un-
believable acreage of 20 million. It
should be stressed that, since the early
19305, our yield per acre has increased
by nearly 70 p.c. Wheat has been
grown again in areas which, three
decades ago, were found tc be economi-
cally marginal and greatly exposed to
wind erosion; it has been taken up even
in dry grazing areas which have never
been under the plough.
The main reason for this tremendous
switch to wheatgrowing is the extremely
favorable wheat legislation, which guar-
antees farmers a highly profitable return
although the guaranteed price is sup-
posed to be only equal to the cost of
production.
Unless wheat acreage is drastically
reduced we shall have to invest heavily
in additional storage space, rolling stock,
harbor facilities and the like, which
may be under-used in the years to come.
Even so, the ogre of huge, unsaleable
wheat stocks is looming large.
Is there no better use for our scarce
resources of labor and capital? It is to
be hoped that an unfortunate misalloca-
tion of our land resources will not result
in a misallocation of the nation's scarce
investment resources.
Wheat acreage reduction could be
brought about voluntarily if Government
authorities and responsible
farmers’ organisation, would stress the
necessity to our 55,000 wheatgrowers.
There is, of course, an alternative. We
could gamble on frequent droughts in
other countries in the next decade.

Recasting an Old Mould
Some queries on a new issue
T>rokers in Melbourne shook their
heads in quiet cynicism when the
market greeted the end of the long wait
for final news from Moulded Products
on its capital plans with a cheer in the
gloomy share climate last week. Some
said it was clever but not clever enough,
and the share’s early gains began to slip
away.
The technique of making a bonus issue
and then a rights issue to holders of the
enlarged Volume of scrip is familiar
enough. Successful examples proliferate
of this method for companies to
get new risk capital cheaply. The ad-
vantages to shareholders can be super-
ficial. They could be worse off or at any
rate no better off than before. The ques-
tion of future earnings is independent of
the equation, though vitally important in
itself and for the share price.
A complicating factor in Moulded
Products’ case is that an obligatory con-
version of £745,358 of 7 p.c. convert-
ible unsecured notes into ordinary ss.
shares at 2s. 6d. premium on a one-for-
one basis maturing on June 30 has had
to be swept into the equity before the
bonus (a three-for-ten) on it could be
made. The new cash issue of ss. shares
on a one-for-four basis is on the bonus
enlarged capital. The net result will be a
massive increase in the issued ordinary
capital from £2,775,068 to £4,854,924,
of which only £889,380 will be new
money (from the cash issue), which in-
cidentally will not rank for dividend until
July 1, although some of it has already
been lodged with the company on a 5
p.c. return basis.
Without putting too fine a point on
it, the servicing of this greatly increased
capital at Moulded Products’ long-
established 14 p.c. dividend rate would
involve a payment of rather more than
the equivalent of last year’s earnings.
A company in an industry of fluctuating
fortune requiring high obsolescence and
depreciation provisions and reserves,
certainly one like Moulded Products
which has adhered more to conservative
finance than any other plastics group
here, would not let itself run to that
scale, of distribution. So it is looking
now to 10 p.c. for next year, when the
new money will be starting to pay its
way.
Going on last year’s earnings of
£537,562, and allowing for the net saving
on convertible note interest, this rate
on the higher capital effective next year
would only be covered about 1.2 times.
So, clearly the directors are optimistic
that earnings are going to rise sub-
stantially. We can't read the crystal ball,
but last year’s rise was about 40 p.c.
The Road Ahead
T . J. Hooker Investment Corpora-
tion’s interim report barely stirred
the markets, as might well have been
expected. Ordinary investors are still
quite a way from being attracted back,
with the ss. shares lingering below par
and directors repeating their sensible
resolve not to consider dividends until
after June 30, 1966.
Yet there’s plenty of evidence in the
report, and the group’s recent behavior,
to indicate the improving effect of tighter
management control accompanied by a
steady accretion to earning power. Net
trading profit for the December half-
year, at £229,000, gave a 27 p.c. increase
on the previous December period. More
revealingly, it was reasonably close to
budget.
The general manager, Mr Keith Camp-
bell, has been quick to point out that the
December period actually catches the
corporation halfway through its pastoral
season. As far as resuscitation goes, the

pastoral division is making a sizeable
contribution to earnings.
Some little disquiet arises, therefore,
from the lower wool clip and prices, and
a reduced turn-off from cattle. Con-
sequently the budget for the current half-
year has suffered a downward revision,
though the general improvement will un-
doubtedly be continued.
Another hindrance, this time affecting
the development division, proceeds from
delays in obtaining approvals at the
hands of one or two laggard municipal
authorities. The estates concerned are
hardly likely to be marketed until the
1965-66 year.
Despite the cessation of American
funds (loans negotiated and taken for
granted as recently as November last) as
a result of extensions to the US Interest
Equalisation Tax, Hookers face no
difficulties in their refinancing operations.
Local sources appear very willing to
supply the continuous fixed interest
money involved. The group has no close
major public redemptions.
These few strains, perhaps, draw too
much attention to the gloomy element.
The overall picture is one of firm
organisation and improvement.
Lolomas Second Life
Since its gold mining leases at
Vatukoula in Fiji were worked out
in 1957, the now (since January this
year) Loloma Mining Corporation NL
ha been exploring on the Australian
mainland for new minerals interests and
in the interim has had mcst of its con-
siderable funds locked up in listed
investments (the portfolio had a book
value of £3,072,142 last June). It has
now advanced its best prospect, an
alluvial tin field in the Herberton-Irvine-
bank area of Northern Queensland, to
a near producing stage.
Everything is practically set for the
company to have the first field at Stan-
bury Hills in this area in production by
mid-year. Its new programme will, how-
ever, require fresh funds, to the tune of
about £500,000. Shareholders will be
invited to subscribe on the basis of one
new ss. share at 10s. premium for every
four held, with 6d. payable on accept-
ance of the offer, 9s. 6d. a share on

following last year’s step-up from 10 to
13 p.c. for the full term, they have had
nothing to grumble about for some time.
The group distributes pretty fully and
if the optimism of the interim report can
be taken at its face value this year’s earn-
ings should turn out well in excess of
last year’s 16.1 p.c. So a final of 11 p.c.,
making the year’s payout 15 p.c., would
not surprise.
Of course nobody is underwriting the
world price of zinc, so a sudden drop in
this could alter the outlook. This time
last year it was around £stgloo a ton.
It has been above £stgl2o (producer
price £stg 125) since then, but had re-
treated to £stg 117 a month ago and is
now around fstgllO, which has been the
producer price since last September. The
world statistical position of the metal
is still strong, though there are one or
two clouds. For instance, demand in
Britain is under threat of a possible con-
traction in industrial activity as the
country measures up to its balance of
payments tasks. Again, the US is con-
sidering legislation to release 200,000
tons of the metal from the Government
while Japan has recently be-
come an exporter of zinc.
In the meantime, EZ reports that its
Tasmanian output is expanding on all
fronts, which apart from zinc, the most
important, include sulphuric acid, super-
phosphate and sulphate of ammonia.
The higher price for concentrates from
Broken Hill operative since the begin-
ning of this year will doubtless have an
adverse effect on profit margins, but
Broken Hill Associated Smelters’ plans
to treat the big slag dumps at Port Pirie,
in which EZ Industries has an interest,
is a good augury, though possibly not of
immediate significance.
Better Condition
/Carrier Air Conditioning (Holdings)
Ltd's expectation of paying a
74 p.c. dividend this year would seem
to indicate the company's reorganisation
is finally paying off. The dividend will
eventuate '‘if, as expected, profit for the
full 1964-65 year proves to be well in
excess’’ of 1963-64's earnings.
Chairman Mr R. H. Minter said the
company would not pay an interim divi-
dend because of the need to conserve
funds to finance improvements at the
Seven Hills (Sydney) manufacturing
plant. He said profit for the December
half-year showed a substantial increase
over that earned in the previous corre-
sponding period.
The present half-year is expected to be
more profitable than the January-June
period in 1964. Mr Minter said current
orders were at a high level. They- in-

In the 1963-64 financial year, Carrier

In the previous year it had capped a

Merger in Strength
T>espite a drop in wool prices, Elder
Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd, Aus-
tralia’s chief woolbroking group, main-
tained profit in the December half-year.
In a short interim report directors say
the profit pattern followed that forecast
at the last annual meeting.
The latest profit (out of which a
steady interim of 4 p.c. is to be paid)
was achieved in the light of the lower
"wool prices and a consequent with-
drawal from sales by growers. In 1963-
64 (the group’s second full year of
operation after the merger) Elders GM
lifted profit 45 p.c. to £2.6 million.
The 10s. shares are selling at present
for about 245., where the yield is 4.1
p.c.
Solid Pioneer
llioneer Concrete Services Ltd’s
consolidated net profit for the half-
year to December showed a “marked
increase" compared with the previous
corresponding period, directors say in an
interim report. Group activity at present
is at a higher level than last year and is
expected to continue for the remainder
of the financial year.
Earning rate on capital “increased sub-
stantially” during the period, say direc-
tors, despite a one-for-four premium
issue and two placements. To back this
up they are holding the interim dividend
at 61 p.c. to maintain the 121 p.c. paid
for the last five years. Shares involved
in the premium issue are eligible for the
interim handout.

Profits To Come?
Shareholders of Tulloch Ltd, heavy
engineer, who are thinking it is
about time the firm accompanied its in-
terim report with actual figures, may
soon have little cause for complaint.
Judging by its latest announcement, Tul-
loch could turn in a profit for the cur-
rent financial year.
In its last full financial year Tulloch
lost £9758 the lowest deficit in a five-
year run of losses. Latest news from the
board is that operations for the half-
year to December resulted in a trading
profit well in line with forecasts.
Directors say the sales volume for the
period was substantially higher "than the
corresponding period of the previous
year in which a trading loss was re-
corded.” Provided the balance of the
financial year shows the anticipated level
of activity, directors fed the "present
rate of profitability will be maintained.”
It’s good to see the word “profit” in
Tulloch’s report and the market has act-
ed accordingly by adding 2d. to the
shares to bring them up to 55.“6d. Again
no dividend is being paid, so the shares
must be bought at their face value and
with, for the immediate future, no pros-
pects of improvement. The full year’s
results will be interesting both in terms
of share price movement and profit.
Appleton Improves
TTighly-respected Appleton Industries
Ltd, Queensland-based metal louvre
and steel building group, has done it
again. In the December half year it set
yet another record and, if things progress
as. directors envisage, the full year
should see another peak.
Record high sales for the six months
reflected growth on both the home and
export market. Profit increased despite
increased costs of labor and materials.
Present price of the 10s. shares is 235.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Another Successful Transporter
F. H. Stephens very reasonably priced
While the “transport” companies
which have been examined over the
last two weeks have had a reasonably
long history as public listed companies,
F. H. Stephens (Consolidated) Ltd pre-
sented its third report as a listed com-
pany about five months ago. During its
three years as a listed company, the
price of the shares has risen from a low
point of 9s. 9d. in 1962 to a high point
of 265. 6d. in 1964. This increase of
172 p.c. indicates the market’s view that
there is still considerable growth poten-
tial in the transport industry.
It is important to appreciate that
F. H. Stephens is not a newcomer to
the industry. The original business
was founded in Tasmania in 1883,
although Mr F. H. Stephens’ association
with the business dates from the begin-
ning of the present century. By the
time the prospectus was prepared for
the public issue, the Stephens operation
had extended to all States of Australia
and there were agents throughout the
world. There were eleven offices land a
staff of over 800 engaged in shipping,
transport and allied services.
The original paid capital of the pub-
lic listed company was £650,000 in 2.6
million ss. shares, which were allotted
as to 800,000 to the general public at
par at the end of 1961. Over the last
three years, allotments have been made
as follows:
To vendors (initial issue) 1,800,000
To public (initial issue) 800,000
For Douglas & Batt (part consideration) 26,676
For Davidsons Transport (part consideration) 21,000
For Barnards 90,706
For R. Hartridge (part consideration) 146,000
2,884,382
l-for-4 at par 721,096
For E. A. Rocke (part consideration) 10,000
Present issued capital 3,615,478
To some extent, Stephens has made
use of its public status to acquire other
businesses, but, in the main, the issue of
shares for this purpose has been very
restrained. The largest issue was the
146,000 shares which were issued for
the Hartridge group and, at a time when
Stephens’ shares were selling some-
where between 14s. 6d. and 15s. 6d. on
the market, these shares were issued for
13s. 6d.
In October, Stephens made its first
issue since listing. This issue contained
a substantial bonus content as it was
made at par when the shares were
around 245. As a result, the investor
who decided not to increase his invest-
ment could have increased his holding
by 18.4 p.c. by selling sufficient rights
to take up the balance.
Since the balance date of June 30,
1964, paid capital has increased by
25.3 p.c. This increase will rank for
dividend from July 1 last and will there-
fore be regarded by many observers as
having ranked for earnings for the same
period. This will mean that to achieve
the same earning rate as for the 1963-64
year, earnings will have to be about
£275,000 for 1964-65.
At the present time, and based on the
information given in the interim report,
there doesn’t seem much possibility that
this increase in earnings will be
achieved. No actual figures were given,
but it was stated that “Net profit for the
six months ended December 31, 1964,
exceeded that of the same period in
1963 by 10 p.c.” The periods are fairly
comparable, although the Hartridge
group was only acquired apparently
just under half way through the six
months ended December 31, 1963. So
far as the six months ended Decem-
ber 31, 1964, is concerned, the com-
pany would not have received the funds
from the new issue until close to the
end of the period and they could not
have contributed much to the earnings
for the period.
Tt would seem then that, all things
being equal, there could well be a
greater increase in earnings for the
second half of this current financial
year, particularly . if the industrial
troubles which affected the results of
some subsidiaries during the first half
have now been settled.
The key to the increase in the second
half will be the earnings which the new
capital will generate. This can only be
guessed at. Nevertheless, it would
appear that there is a strong possibility
that the earning rate could slip slightly,
perhaps only because the new capital
will only be earning for about seven
months.
In the previous two articles, rough
ratios of profitability have been given,
based on the percentages which net pro-
fit before tax, depreciation and interest
on long-term loans bears to total capital.
Again, as with Mayne Nickless,
Stephens’ acquisitions make it a little
difficult to calculate this ratio. The
approximation would be conservative
and the figures are favorable to Stephens:
Year ended. June 30 1962 1963 1964
Brambles 14.4 19.3 29.3
Mayne Nickless 33.3 28.9 29.2
F. H. Stephens 26.3 30.1 33.7
It is a real tribute to the Stephens’
management that they have been able
to show an increase in this ratio during
a period when the group has been ex-
panded by takeovers.
It is not then surprising to find that
F. H. Stephens’ shares are perhaps the
highest priced, in terms of dividend
yield, of the three companies we have
considered. As at the close of business
on February 18, the last sale for each
of the three stocks was as follows:
Earnings
Last Div. yield
sale Buyer Seller yield (a)
Brambles 18/3 18/- 18/6 4.1% 7.1%
Mayne Nickless 35/6 35/- 36/6 3.5% 6.2%
F. H. Stephens 19/6 19/- 19/9 2.6% 7.3%
(a) The earnings yields are based on my estimates
of the likely earnings rates after the new
issues of equity made since the last balance
date.
Having in mind the remarkably good
record of earnings over the last seven
years, it can only be said that Stephens’
shares are very reasonably priced in
relation to the shares of the other two
companies. Unfortunately, the dividend
payout is low at present, even after the
new issue, and consequently the divi-
dend yield is low also. Until such time
as investors can see the prospects of a
definite regular increase in dividend
payments, the shares are unlikely to sell
for a price that will show a dividend
yield much below the present one. In
other words, a limit of, say, 20s. would
seem to have been set until the company
makes another issue or increases the
dividend rate.

Dry-cleaning Expansion
Spotless story of growth
IyiELBOURNE-BASED Spotless Ltd can
truly be called the phenomenon of
the dry-cleaning industry. Yet while no
other group has expanded as rapidly or
done so well, investors still regard the
shares with suspicion. With current
prices at about 125., the ss. units
yield an attractive 5.2 p.c. from the
121 p.c. dividend, after brokerage. Add
to this the size of reserves in relation to
paid capital, the high earnings which
will at least be maintained in the cur-
rent year and the fact that no issue has
been made to shareholders since listing
in April, 1961, and it's hard not to con-
clude that the shares are underpriced.
The business was established in 1946.
It was incorporated in 1957 and floated
via a share placement through lan Pot-
ter and Co. in 1961. At that time, 11
dry-cleaning plants were operating, a
general laundry, and a shoe repair fac-
tory. Subsidiaries totalled 17 and the
group did business through about 450
outlets, of which more than 100 were
company-controlled shops.
Possibly one explanation for the way
the shares have held back, especially in
the first two years of listing, is the ex-
tensive benefits which were distributed
to the original shareholders before the
placement. C_apital at balance date
1960 was £200,000. This was halved
by a return to shareholders of 10s. in
the £. Nominal capital was doubled and
the 20s. shares split to 55., then a
£150,000 revaluation was capitalised by
a three-for-tyo bonus issue. Obviously
there was nothing much left for the new
shareholders after the placement, as the
group had virtually been sucked dry.
Successful growth and expansion over
the past years has changed the position
now. As well as the no-issue history
since listing, there has been no asset
revaluation either. Even in the 1961
Memorandum of Offer, an independent
valuer felt the plant, machinery and in-
stallations were worth £208.000, almost
£.80,000 more than the directors had
valued them at. Add this figure to the
reserves and fixed assets in the accom-
panying table and it can be seen how
much more attractive an already favor-
able financial position would look.
At balance date last year, the group
was running 17 plants, four of them be-
ing the new one-hour units for people
in a hell of a hurry. The number of
outlets had expanded to 592, 196 of
them being company owned. A new
addition since listing has been a garment
repair factory. There was still only
one general laundry and one shoe repair
factory, both of whicli, however, have
been expanded considerably since 1961
to cater for extra business. The num-
ber of subsidiaries stood at 22.
Expansion has by no means slowed
down since balance date. Drive-Way
Dry Cleaners of Shepparton has been
acquired, a group with nine shops and
agencies. This was only a small part of
a campaign which is under way in the
provincial areas. Harrington’s, with a
factory at Moe and shops at Moe, Mor-
well and Yallourn, was bought for cash
to expand business in the Latrobe Valley
and a buy at Benalla established the
group’s second plant in the Goulburn
Valley. At the time of going to press,
20 plants were operating and the num-
ber of outlets had grown to 622, 221
of which were company controlled.
With all this expansion, a spanner
could logically be expected in the works
at some stage. It came in the 1962-63
year, as the sharp drop in profits shown
in the table illustrates. Capital expendi-
ture, general expenses, disruption and
loss of profits were all caused by the
moving of the laundry to a new loca-
tion, increasing equipment and capacity
at the same time. Establishment costs
were higher and more prolonged than
originally anticipated. In fact, they ex-
tended into the first half of 1963-64,
when profits dropped again despite a
rising turnover.
All is well now. The new and more
efficient laundry is making greater profit
contributions than ever before. The full
result for 1963-64 reflects this benefit in
the final six months, along with the in-
troduction by the company of better
cost control and centralised administra-
tion. Favorable seasonal conditions also
brought their benefits. Profit jumped
to equal 32.5 p.c. on capital and re-
established the healthy growth rate of
the years prior to 1962-63.
The operations of these factors for
all of 1964-65, plus continued expansion,
should boost the earning rate again.
How big the improvement is will depend
on how hard the company is hit by the
full impact of last year’s basic wage in-
crease. Spotless operates in an industry
where all sales have a large labor com-
ponent.
Apart from dry-cleaning and all the
connected activities, such as laundering,
dying and repairing, the company has
done extremely well through diversifica-
tion, particularly into linen hire and
industrial cleaning fields. Other ancil-
lary services, like shoe repairs and in-

visible mending, have all found a rapidly
expanding demand, especially the for-
mer. Although the company recognises
the value of such diversification, it does
not neglect the search for improved dry-
cleaning and laundering techniques, to
improve the main revenue sources
The only item of concern in the
accompanying table is the lack of work-
ing capital. However, it is not worth
worrying over. The figure is not high
and apparently the company has always
operated with a deficiency. On top of
this, it is a result of the numerous cash
takeovers among other things, and gives
scope to argue for the possibilities of a
cash issue. It must also be remembered
that these takeovers are increasing the
money flow and boosting earning rates
without touching the paid capital on
which performances are based.
Fixed assets show a healthy and un-
faltering growth trend. Intangibles com-
prising mainly goodwill on consolida-
tion. are rather high but are gradually
being written down. Reserves have
grown considerably. At balance date
last year, £40.000 was transferred from
unappropriated profits to the general
reserve. The loan capital is negligible
and shows an encouraging downward
trend.
Profits and earning rates leave little to
be desired, except for that 1962-63 set-
back. Dividends have been generous,
while still allowing plenty in the way of
a surplus. Share prices show an up-
ward overall trend, although the high
dividends have always kept the stock
attractive from an income point of
view. The shares would have been bar-
gain buying during 1961, when yields
were so high and the price only half of
what it is today.
Summing up, the scrip looks to be a
good purchase at present prices for the
short or medium term. The company is
set for another record year in an indus-
try which is seeing bigger turnovers
every year, and should continue to do so
for some time. Cleanliness is next to
godliness, they say! The prospects
could not be better for a cash issue, pro-
bably at a small premium, sometime this
year. At worst, shareholders will see a
higher dividend again this year or, if
they're really unlucky, just another year
of growth and a Steady but better covered
dividend.

R. FOWLER LTD
Buoyancy from Building
three years of reorganisation
and consolidation, R. Fowler Ltd,
in the year to September 30 last, .more
than recovered from the setback incurred
in the 1960 credit squeeze, turning in a
record profit and higher dividend.
Since September, the group has main-
tained the improvement of the previous
year. Directors have forecast a satis-
factory result for the latest 12 months.
The company came into being in
1919 and was granted Stock Exchange
listing in 1922 with a paid-up capital of
£190,000.
Losses were incurred in the depression
years of 1930-32. Since then Fowler has
recorded steadily rising profits, capped
by last year’s record £112,227.
The company’s principal activities are
the manufacture of sanitaryware and
stoneware pipes, both of which are
dependent on a prosperous building in-
dustry. It also makes wall and floor tiles,
though these do not play as great a part
in its activities as the first two items.
The main potteries are at Marrick-
ville and Marsfield (Sydney suburbs),
Thomastown (Victoria) and Alderley
(Queensland). Late last year the com-
pany sold its property at Edwardstown in
South Australia for £157,460 —£1 12,000
more than was paid in 1959.
The plant at all these works is kept at
top efficiency by installation of the latest
machinery. Last year the company spent
£127,685 on capital additions. Capital
works outstanding at balance date stood
at £85,000.
The company- is also maintaining the
highest standards in its showrooms, and
last year built new premises in Victoria,
Brisbane and Newcastle. Work is also
under way at Hornsby in NSW.
Results are closely allied to those of
the building industry, so it is not sur-
prising that the 1963-64 year should
have shown a 25 p.c. improvement.
From the previous record of £92,229,
earned in the 1959 year, profit fell rather
rapidly to £64,571 two years later. How-

ever, from then on the recovery has been
steady, with last year's increase from
£90,765 to £112,227, equal to 17.8 p.c.
on capital.
The provision for taxation indicates
that the result is substantially under-
stated as far as the Taxation Com-
missioner is concerned. At £145,000 the
provision would seem to indicate a tax
rate of about 12s. in the £l. The
accounts show that certain provisions
have been made which are not usually
considered as such, but rather appropria-
tions.
These include a £12,000 provision
against stocks (compared with £7OOO in
the previous year) and £22,000 for
doubtful debts (£7OOO previously). In
addition, directors point out that the
depreciation of £91,575 (£80,409) in-
cludes some which is not allowable for
taxation purposes.
Keeping in line with the movement in
profit, dividend was cut from lli p.c.
in 1959 to 10 p.c. and then to -7i p-.c.
With the improvement in earnings, it
was lifted to 9 p.c. in 1962, 10 p.c. the
following year, and last year was restored
to Ilf p.c., including a final 6i p.c.
Maintenance of this final rate would
mean return to the 12+ p.c. paid for the
two years 1957 and 1958.
Capital issues liave not been many,
though shareholders received a virtual
two-for-three bonus 1954. They
received another one-for-two bonus fol-
lowed by a one-for-two cash at par in
1959. Together with several small take-
overs, paid-up capital has been lifted to
the present £647,825, made up of 40,000
20s. 10 p.c. preference shares and
2,431,300 ss. ordinary shares. These
latter were split from 20s. units in 1960.
Despite the comparatively recent
bonus issue, shareholders are obviously
not discounting another. The state of the
company’s accounts indicates that their
hopes could well he realised.
Reserves of a capital nature total
£504,400, sufficient for a very attractive
bonus, while freehold and leasehold in
the books at £1,026,242, subject to
depreciation of £126,609, is obviously
undervalued.
The accounts show the company to be
in a highly liquid position, with cash
funds of £246,541 at balance date since
augmented by the Adelaide sale. Cur-
rent assets continue to exceed liabilities
by more than two-to-one. Stock appears
in the books at £412,255. Against this,
directors have created a provision of
£89,000 —reducing its value by more than
20 p.c. Similarly, against the trade
debtors of £370,375- is provided £63,873
(almost 20 p.c.).
With the building industry remaining
buoyant, the results for the current year
seem assured. The long-term prospect is
also pleasing although Japanese manu-
facturers of floor and wall tiles have
dimmed the prospect for this section of
the group's activities.
The shares at the current level of
14s. 6d. appear cheap. Based on book
values, the assets backing of each ss. unit
is 15s. Bd.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Really Active Week
By-passing some new market rules
market is upsetting everyone by
A its depressing behavior. The old-
fashioned idea of buying a company’s
shares because the profits of -that com-
pany are going up just does not hold
any longer. It seems a whole new set
of rules have been adapted for buying
shares on this market. One of the rules
seems to be to sell before a good report.
In most cases, the share price just slides
down on the report's publication.
One exception to this new rule was
lohn Lysaght. But then its share price
of 525. 6d. was very close to its low
point, and the announcement of the
28 p.c. increase in profits to £3.4 mil-
lion was an exceptional one. This
jumped the earning rate up from 15.7
p.c. to 22 p.c. A glowing report all
round, except for the warning by the
directors “that the latter part of the
year (1965) may not be equally buoy-
ant’’ when compared with the start of
1965. v
Although the above rule didn’t 'im J
mediately apply, I thought it could still
be used as a guide on this crazy market.
So when the shares rose to 545. on the
Thursday, I decided to become a seller
of 100.
Shorting is a dangerous practice, yet
it seems to be the only way I can make
money on the market. Time has forced
me to buy back the Mt Isa shares at
335. 3d. The £3l profit made up for
a few moments of tension felt during
the duration of this transaction.
One of the few other favorable-
positions in the portfolio was Anderson
Meat. Defying the rest of the market,
the shares had gamely put on Is. to
335. At this price, the profit bait was
too strong to withstand. The sale of
these shares added another £3B to the
credit side of the year’s trading. Making
a very minor contribution to profits was
the sale of lames Hardie at Ills.
Not so happy a story was the sale
of Pye Industries and Warburton Lranki.
I’ve no doubt that Pye is doing very well
in the appliance industry. As a low
yielder, though, it’s proving more vulner-
able to capital depreciation than many
of the speculative issues around par.
Selling at 225. 6d. resulted in a £2O loss.
Warburton Franki proved a very
sudden anti-climax following my pur-
chase last week. It is hard to reconcile
a lower profit for the first half of the
year, announced just after my purchase,
with one or two of the statements made
by the chairman in his address last
October and quoted in last week’s diary.
Just refreshing your memory, he talked
about the prospect of “much improved
profits for the year”. My loss in this
case was just over the £lO mark.
Perhaps the most disappointing share
in the portfolio is ISAS (NSW). Since
the shares went ex the l-for-4 par issue,
the market has collapsed. First sale of
the rights was at a miserable 6d. Such
a price seemed ridiculously low. Bracing
myself for attack, I calculated that 500
at this price would cost only £l4. With
my entitlement for 100 rights, I now
have more than a passing interest in
ISAS (NSW).
In what must be regarded as an active
week, my final transaction was the short-
ing of 400 Nuttall at 13s. lOd. Working
on the theory that all shares will
ultimately topple in this market, Nuttall
seemed to be as good a share as any
to short. Especially as this share is
having an earnings yield of not much
more than 8 p.c.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
300 Mt Isa, 33/3 £673

200 Warburton Franki, 19/9 £194
100 John Lysaght, 547- £266
All this throws the account back into
credit to the tune of £694. Let’s hope
the market changes its tone so that I can
use these funds.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Farm Subsidies for Australia?
Tacit support for the tractor makers
"CWeryone looks for simple answers and
simple explanations .. . and there are
no simple answers and no simple explana-
tions.
Everyone knows, in simple terms, that
farming in the United States and the
United Kingdom is heavily subsidised.
Everyone, excepting the out-and-out
socialists, gets cold shivers at the thought
of similar subsidies becoming necessary
in Australia. To date we have escaped
them, although it is not quite true to
say that we ignore them altogether.
The various stabilisation price systems
in operation for wheat —and most other
primary products excepting wool-—and
the various taxation concessions to prim-
ary producers are a form of farm
subsidy. They are not, though, really
comparable with the US and UK sub-
sidies.
Now in the US it is accepted, in simple
terms, that the 3000 million dollars a
year in direct price supports, and the
overall 8000 million dollars in farm
subsidies of all kinds, are necessary in
order that farmers may stay on their
farms. That's putting it very simply.
Very simply, it does not work and
never has. US farmers continue to fight
a losing battle against increasing, costs
of production and continue to leave
their farms in large numbers. More than
60 p.c. of the total US farm production
comes from less than 15 p.c. of the
farms. These are highly mechanised,
highly efficient, highly specialised big
operations.
When President Johnson, some weeks
after his successful election campaign,
announced that he would cut back the
farm subsidy bill, most observers, in the
US and elsewhere, accepted his words
at their simple face value. But sceptics
in the US, closer to the problem than
we are, suggested that he did not really
mean it. It would appear that they are
quite right.
The bill Johnson has now put before
Congress does shave something off the
1964 direct price supports programme,
but the overall total of farm subsidies
will still be around the incredible 8,000
million dollars mark. The plain truth
seems to be that, while the unproductive
farmers need the benefits of farm sub-
sidy, the US secondary industry complex
needs it also. This is the other aspect
of farm subsidies (it applies in the UK
and would apply here) which few dare
to mention.
In particular the automotive industry,
that paragon of free enterprise, would
be in sore’ straits if the farm subsidies
were really removed. To sell tractors
(and implements and trucks) to farmers
it is necessary for those farmers to have
a steady, stabilised income. If their
incomes fluctuate wildly from season to
season, then some years they will buy a
new tractor and in others they will not.
Yet you cannot produce tractors on a
hit-and-miss, up-and-down manufacturing
system. It has to be orderly, or as orderly
as possible. The plants have to be
tooled up; the steel has to be rolled; the
employees have to be organised; the sell-
ing campaigns, the advertising, and all
the other items which fit into the jig-
saw of a modern industrial enterprise
have to be planned.
Here we have the not very simple
situation in which the US automotive
industry, free enterprise all along the
line, actually gives strong, tacit support
to the idea of farm subsidies. Other in-
dustries do likewise. They have to. It
goes against the grain, of course.
The whole concept of the automotive
industry is a private enterprise one. The
folklore that has grown up around such
people as Henry Ford and the early
General Motor’s people all belongs to the
private enterprise ideal: “What’s good
for General Motors is good for the
world.”
“Henry Ford wanted to make a car
and put the world on wheels.” He is
supposed to have said: “History is bunk.”
If he did, he probably meant that
ambitious nations tend to write histories
about themselves which suit them. And
so they do. His wife is supposed to have
said: “Henry never thought the factory
would get so big.” And probably hQ
didn’t.
Could he have ever envisaged aft
annual farm subsidy bill, on the tax-
payer, of 8,000 million dollars? And
that farm subsidy being a necessary part
of the selling of his tractors? Probably
not.
Then, talking about tractors, there was
the remarkable Harry Ferguson. Just
a man working in a dingy garage in
England with an idea in his head that a
tractor should be able to do more than
pull forward, like a horse. So he evolved
the three-point-linkage system of attach-
ing implements to tractors. The im-
plements then could be given vertical
control and a whole new era of tractors
came into being.
First there were his own tractors, the
little Fergusons, which swept the world
just after World War 11. Then his patents

were broken—mainly by Ford, who had
to pay a record sum in compensation.
Then all tractors became, in a sense,
Ferguson tractors.
Now, in the ’sixties, all tractors use
three-point-linkage with hydraulic ver-
tical lift. Ferguson was the Henry Ford
of tractors.
Right now, in 1965, the tractor situa-
tion in Australia is highly interesting.
There are about 250,000 farms in the
whole of Australia and there are about
the same number of tractors. It is not
really that every farm has' one tractor,
some farms have more than one, but
that's how the figures average out.
The new tractors sold in any one year
have gone as high as 20,000, but are
usually a little below 10,000. The last
three years have seen big sales of wheat to
Red China, with a big increase in wheat
acreages. This has meant more tractors
and more implements.
The tractor people looked at the
booming wheat business and decided to
meet it with new models. Naturally
these models took time to plan and time
to get into production. The big year
for the new models will be this year,
1965. Quite suddenly the prospects of
a sudden slump in farm income, due to
fluctuating prices for primary produce,
have become apparent. Some of the
tractor people may find themselves with
brand new models they cannot sell.
Of Australia's 250,000 farms, about
half are sheep, wheat-sheep, or wheat.
The biggest single bloc, in terms of
tractor and implement requirements, is
the wheat-sheep and wheat. There
would be at least 50,000 of these. Due
to the increase in wheat plantings last
season, and the time lag before official
statistics catch up, it might be a good
deal more than 50,000.
According to Bureau of Agricultural
Economics statistics, Australia must
face the following likely returns for
1964-65. Wheat exports are expected to
be down, in value, about £57 million.
Wool is expected to be down about
£63 million. Farm income overall (in-
cluding all farming operations) is ex-
pected to be down about £2O million.
Gains in dairy produce and meat (not
particularly big users of tractors) will
help offset the wheat and wool values
decline.
These are estimates (there is only until
July for the 1964-65 season to end) and
it can be readily understood why some
of the tractor people are worried. They
cannot turn back now. The advertising
campaigns are in full swing. The trac-
tors are being assembled. Massey-
Ferguson, the biggest Australian seller,
has new models ready to launch within
a few weeks. The new Ford models have
already been launched.
Both these models include a range of


“on the move shift” tractors. It is not
really as refined as automatic transmis-
sion in motor cars; nevertheless it is a
notable advance and plenty of farmers
like the idea. Fiat, like Massey-
Ferguson a derivative of the old Fergu-
son tractor, is matching the bigger
companies’ selling campaigns and has
increased its horsepower and hydraulics
range. International Harvester and
Chamberlain are noticeably stepping up
their sales campaigns and appear to be
stressing a “we have the size and the
power to do the job” image.
John Deere has reappeared on the
Australian market after an absence of
some years. Allis Chalmers also. Nuf-
field employs a “more extras for the
same price” selling line. Then there are
a couple of giants from the US, Minne-
apolis Moline and Case, which, despite
high initial cost, are appealing to wheat
farmers with broad acres. And, as pre-
dicted in these pages almost eight months
ago, the Japanese have at last found
their way in.
The first Japanese tractors, small jobs,
are due to be displayed at field days any
time now. A Melbourne-based imple-
ment manufacturer, A. V. Page, has got
the Australian franchise. No one doubts
his ability to sell them. Everyone knows
how Jap cars are selling here.
Mr Page developed a rotary slasher
which cut close enough to be used for
haymaking a few years ago. It is just
possible that he was the first man in the
world to do it. He is one of the 450-odd
implement manufacturers in Australia
who make ploughs, scarifiers, slashers,
post-hole diggers, scoops, graders and
so on to fit the special requirements of
Australian farmers. These 450-odd im-
plement makers fit the private enterprise
ideal also. Many are one-man shows,
or partnerships, and they live by- their
ingenuity and close knowledge of what
“specialised requirements” really amount
to. They roll their sleeves up and get
on with it.
For all of them it is going to be an
interesting year —a year of hard selling.
In time it would not surprise this writer
if woolgrowers, wheatgrowers, and other
primary producers who make much of
the need for more stabilised incomes,
get support from an unexpected quarter;
namely, those industries which depend
on selling to farmers. The one simple
truism of this age appears to be that
while politics proposes, economics dis-
poses.
LETTER
Wheat Sales and Foreign Policy
A reply to Dr Albinski
Sir,
Being one of the “many Australians
who have evinced concern over their
country’s heavy credit wheat sales to
China”, I read with great interest Dr
Albinski’s article, “Wheat Sales and
Foreign Policy”, in the “Man on the
Land” section of your issue of Febru-
ary 13.
I am a man on the land, a wool and
beef producer, who does not wish to
see the past policy of preference to Red
China in the wheat export industry
extended to the wool industry. I am
also strongly opposed to wool promotion
funds being used, to quote Dr Albinski’s
phrase, as “a form of foreign aid to a
near-enemy country”—whether that aid
helps this near-enemy country to make
a gift of wheat to Cuba or to give a
million tons of rice to Indonesia.
By implication Dr Albinski accuses
his own country of discriminating
against Australian meat. What are the
facts? For years Australian beef prices
were well below world prices because
of the restrictions contained in the
British-Australian Meat Agreement. But
once we obtained the right to export to
countries other than Britain, our beef
export prices almost doubled. Since
then, the American market has been the
chief factor in the continued prosperity
of the cattle industry, as well as being a
valuable outlet for our old mutton.
“What of Chinese behavior?” asks Dr
Albinski. Surely he knows that we have
not yet reached the end of the chapter.
Surely he knows that it is Communist
practice to apply economic pressure
first; political pressures come later. In
the “Australian Financial Review” of
November 20 last, it was claimed “that
Australia's export wheat is already £4
to £6 per ton cheaper than Canadian . . .
following a 1,500,000 tons Australian
sale to China reportedly at the lowest
price”. Is this the first instalment of
economic pressure upon our recently
expanded wheat industry?
I wonder that Dr Albinski did not
hear of the £lOO a piece cablegrams
sent from Peking to Australian wool-
buyers to put pressure on them to sup-
port Peking's world-wide campaign for
the release of the six Chinese traders
and three Pressmen being held on
charges of subversion in Brazil. Is he
ignorant of the claim by Peking Radio,
in a broadcast on April 22 last, that
among those who supported the appeal
for the release of the Chinese were
trade organisations of Korea, Japan, the
Sudan and Australia? And so at least
one Australian business organisation is
claimed to have lined itself up with the
world-wide array of Communist front
and stooge organisations demanding the
release of the nine Chinese.
Finally, Dr Albinski asserts that “not
even an ALP Government both because
of conviction, and an eye on public re-
action. could be expected to surrender
to political threats”. The doctor assumes
that future Chinese demands will be the
blatant demands of a clumsy black-
mailer, and so arouse public alarm.
Chinese policy is more subtle; Chinese
policy is that Australia should join the
neutralist Afro - Asian bloc—as an-
nounced by Kuo Mo-jo in August, 1961.
All Australians would do well to
remember Sir John Crawford’s warning
last July that Australia must be prepared
to do without large sales of wheat to
China, to cease trading with China, the
moment foreign policy requires it. I
ask what plans has our Commonwealth
Government made to cope with such
an eventuality. Indulgence in mutual
whitewashing by the Wheat Board and
Government Departments will do little
to maintain the solvency of the Austra-
lian wheat industry in such a crisis.

likely to be on scientific methods of
preventing seepage. Plastic film, rubber
compounds, mechanical earth solidifiers
and so on are some of the ideas being
experimented with. Scientists agree,
though, that many dams built years ago
by horse teams have stood the test of
time remarkably well.
The old method involved a pair, or
more; of horses hauling a bucket type
scoop. The scoop took only a relatively
small portion of earth away at a time.
The overall action was similar to a
dentist carefully packing a filling into
a cavity, particle by particle.
The bulldozer has never been able
to reproduce this action. Its great
weight has a solidifying effect, but only
on the layer of earth directly beneath
its tracks.
Some farmers have herded mobs of
cattle or sheep over and around a dam
after completion by a bulldozer. Again
only the top layer gets the pounding of
the hooves.
A few horse teams are still employed
in the irrigation districts for cleaning
out and otherwise repairing channels.
Generally speaking, however, the Clydes-
dale’s main use these days is, unhappily,
in the pet food trade. And it is not
always old, unwanted horses which are

Which panel is ‘Perspex’?
The camera can’t tell, and that makes it tough for you to pick it. But we can
tell you this clear ‘Perspex’ acrylic sheet permits transmission of 92%
of visible light; that’s a higher factor than glass. Let’s also consider that
depending on the required degree of diffusion and light intensity, there are
special grades of ‘Perspex’ which give maximum performance.
Add to this, the fact that ‘Perspex’ allows complete freedom of design, that it’
lighter, stronger and safer than glass, and you have some pretty good reasons
why 1.C.1. ‘Perspex’ acrylic sheet is today’s outstanding product for lighting.
