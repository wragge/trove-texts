THE YELLOW BOOK.
With its fifth number The Yellow Book com-
mences a second year of revolt. It has undeni-
ably strengthened its position since it sprang in
April, ’94, from the brains of a few English writers
and artists—mainly of minor status—who loathed
Cockaigne conventionality and longed for the
license of France. The Yellow Book has now a
considerable public of its own ; and, commercially,
it looks likely to succeed.
• • •
From a literary and artistic poind of view its
success is hardly so sure. It has fallen short, not
indeed of the current standard by which magazines
are judged—in brilliant originality The Yellow
Book has no rival among its kindred—but of the
permanent standard by which we judge literature.
So mnch, before its advent, was heard of the
mute, inglorious Miltons, who needed only sing-
ing-opportunity t 6 gain their everlasting crown ;
of the Shakespeares who, for lack of publicity and
laurels, plucked an inadequate wreath of haw-
thorn from the village hedge-rows; that there is
some slight sense of dissatisfaction at the achieve-
ments which Milton and Shakespeare redivivi
have paraded in the light of Yellow day. One is
not quite sure whether the new apostles have
made their title clear to mansions in the skies or
in the flies.
• • •
This ft) comparative regret, but it is not, or
should ftot bp, positive depreciation. The all-
round quality of The Yellow Book is noticeably
high and singularly uniform. The art is mostly
ugliness—a'thing of blots and scratches—but
there is more than one illustration with force and
charm. It is, of course, possible to contend that
ugliness is a form of beauty—a sub- or rather
supra-asp Pct which the profauum vulgus cannot
see for ithelf and cannot comprehend when shown
to it. Only, as appreciations are relative, and
impressions are subjective, and there is no final
criterion of what is most desirable in love or art
or anything else, it is obviously better for the
profammi Vulgus to be rather Philistinish than
hypocritical—efinoe,it never knows if its critics do
not themselves really live in Philistia,
• * •
The verse Of The Yellow Book is poor in com-
parison with the prose. There is one striking
piece—John Davidson's “Ballad of a Nun” (in
vol. 3), and two or three others pleasant and in-
uring—notably Alfred Hayes’ “My Study”
(v01..2), and “Two Songs” by Charles Sydney
(vol. 4). Even these do not take first rank ; and
the remainder is the kind of poetry easily com-
passed at a certain pitch of culture—smart, cor-
rect and barren. Poetry, as a whole, may be
divided into think-things and pretty-tliings;
kernel-verse and husk-verse; the class which
draws uS by its truth and strength, and the class
which interests us by its glitter and melody. The
poets of the day, the poets of The Yellow Book,
are chiefly manufacturers of pretty - things.
They are deft phrasemongers, and juggle
marvellously with jewelled verbiage; but the
divine fire of the elder bards is not theirs. The
note of the superficial, the ephemeral, is struck by
nearly all. Take William Watson’s “Hymn to
the Sea,” in The Yellow Book (vol. 5). Here are
the introductory lines
Oram, O regal in bounty, a subtle and delicate hrgesa ;
Grant an ethereal alms, out of the wealth of thy soul.
Stiff r a tarrying minstrel, who finds and not fashions bis
numbers— .
Who, from the commune of air, cages the volatile song—
Here to capture and prison some fugitive breath of thy
descant.
Thine and his own as thy roar lisped on the lips of a shell.
Now while the vernal impulsion makes lyrical all that
hath language,
While, through the veins of the Earth, riots the ichor of
Spring,
While, with throes, with raptures, with loosing of bonds
and unsealings—
Arrowy pangs of delight, piercing the core of the world—
Tremors and coy uufoldiugs, reluctances, sweet agita-
tions—
Vouth, irrepressibly fair, wakes like a wandering rose.
These lines have been praised for their beauty;
and that they have a certain beauty of form may
be conceded. But they do not help us; their mes-
is but an echo; the description of Spring
impresses us as showing dexterous trickery, not
superior insight. And for mere beauty of form
neither these lines nor any which follow, over-
loaded with imagery and epithet, can be compared
to many verses of Brunton Stephens’ “Convict
Once,” in a. measure similar, but rhymed.
# # *
The prose of the Yellow Book is generally vivid,
forcible, and original. It is interesting to note
that some of the most vigorous work, such as that
by “ C. 5.,” sets a style which corresponds very
closely with that sought by The Bulletin. The
ordinary English tale has a small, weak point at
the end of a long, weak introduction. Occasion-
ally the point is strong, but the introduction is
almost invariably weak. The Bulletin asks from
its contributors brevity, and interest which races
from strong beginning to strong climax. This is
what “C.S.” achieves in several Yellow Book
sketches, of which “For Ever and Ever” (in vol.
5) may stand as model.
* m m
Henry Harland, Marriott Watson, and Ella
D’Aicy, have all given The Yellow Book brilliant
tales, which are being reprinted; with additions, in
the “ Keynotes ” series. Certain essays by Max
Beerbohm and Dauphin Meunier, and tales by
Hubert Craekanthorpe, have been particularly
clever; and “ Victoria Cross ” contributed to the
fourth volume a tale, “Theodora,” very striking
and audacious, The fifth volume is of good
average merit, and has one remarkably fine tale,
“ The Pleasure Pilgrim,” by Ella D’Aroy,

Handy Language Books.
As a language is alive it is as difficult
to bag as a cat: it slips through pen
and tongue as quicksilver slips through
your fingers. Yet, though no writer or
speaker can hope to be absolutely correct,
it is plain to everyone with eyes and ears
that some are more correct than others.
Within the last few years a tribe of little
handy-books has sprung up to point the
way to linguistic precision, and some of
them will repay purchase and study.
“How to Talk Correctly” (Bd.) quotes a
large number of common errors in speak-
ing and writing, and supplies corrections.
“Don’t,” a similar manual (Bd.), carries
censorship into the domain of manners,
and gives a large number of hints which it
is pleasant to approve without heeding.
‘Just the Word Wanted” (Is. 2d.) is a
simple book of synonyms, easily come-at-
able.
“The Handy Guide to Correct Pronuncia-
tion ” (Is. 2d.) lists words commonly mis-
pronounced, and supplies the proper
pronunciation.
“The Secretary’s Assistant ”(ls. 2d.) teaches
how to address letters correctly to C.M.G.’s
and others of touchy dignity and indignity.
“The Dictionary of Blunders” (Is. 2d.) sets
one right upon common errors of epithet
and phrase.
“Familiar English Quotations ” (Is 2d) is a
vest-pocket book useful as far as it goes,
but going hardly far enough.
“Everybody’s Writing-Desk Book” (Is 3d)
is cordially recommended as the best of
the lot, covering nearly as much ground
as all the preceding together.
“Common Words Commonly Mispronouced”
(2s 4d) goes into the finer shades of pro-
nunciation, and appeals to professional
speakers rather than to the ordinary ama-
teur variety.

Uo Maupassant, a choice selection (chiefly
from the “Contes de Lundi ”), and ex-
hibiting a side of the author’s gtniu > not
shown in the “Short Stories ” elsewhere
listed,
A Saint, and other tales, by Paul Bourget.
The “other tales” are “A Gambler,”
“Two Little Boys,” and “Childhood
Perfidy’ —all characteristic of the author’s
limpid method.
The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard, by Anatole
France.
Dame Care, by Hermann Sudennann.
The House by the Medlar-Tree, by Giovanni
Verga.
Gallegher, and other stories, by Richard
Harding Davis.
Balaam and his Master, and other sketches
and stories, by Joel Chandler Harris.
*** With the doubtful exception of “The
Odd Number,” the stories, in this series
are rather recommended by style and
sympathy than by plot or vivid interest.
Davis and Harris have considerable Ameri-
can vogue, justified by their drollery and
perception ; but the average reader finds
them tending to dullness. Verga, Suder-
mann, and Anatole France employ the
charm of simplicity, not the fascination of
strength and splendour. Bonrget’s stories
are lilies, not roses of literature—unless it
be white moss-roses. De Maupassant’s
striking book can be recommended for
general purchase : the others require some
“ acquired taste,” some welcome of appre-
ciative culture. Paper, 3s. each.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never'allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his Children. You are at liberty to make what
use’you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
-—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—-I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”
Prepared only, and sold wholesale and retail, by
the proprietor, W. G. Hearne, chemist, Geelong,

To be obtained in bottles, small size, 2s. 6d., large,

O URSELVHBI
We wish It to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
nevercease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it. has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,
skin, and restores the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite skin beau-
tifier, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces, Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor
Remedies, cleanses the blood of all impurities and poisonous ele-
ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies
cure every disease and humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss
of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.
All about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-
tions, and 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuticura Resolvent.
Cuticura Remedies are sold throughout the world. Price, Cuticura, 30c. ; Cuticura Soap, 23c.:

Of great deeds done in days when I was free ;
Yea, deeds of valour which now otherwise
Than in remembrance I shall never see,
I see the fan-tan shops in Sussex-street,
The lonely copper pacing on his beat.
The push assembled looking out for larks,
And blokes at corners waiting for their “meat.”
The bright, glad days at Chowder, and the night
wu fc ™ tra P s oufc > and ''■he glorious fight
W 'lv[arks irllo aSOn P* u ££ ec * young Sheeney
For dancing with his tart. It was all right.
And then I think of this, the last best thing
ihat made me to the push a crimson king,
111 tell you how it chanced, my great, bright
deed,
That raised me up and left me sorrowing.
There was a swine that gave the crowd away
■“■l™ got us three months each. Long time we lay
-c or him before we got him : for great need
Had we for caution ; but we made him pay.
At last, one night we caught him all alone—
-1 ifteen of us. I dropped him with a stone
Behind the ear ; I plugged him once again;
ihe push sailed in, for he was all our own.
How could we know he would cop out? We meant
Merely to stiffen him ; but ere we went
Homeward again they lumbered me, and then
1 got twelve years for wounding with intent.
Right glad to miss the gallows. Yet small cheer
.Remains for me who pay for joys too dear,
r blue-metal that I loved so well,
I hate now—set to break it prisoned here.
Yea, freedom now no good to me may bring;
The years that pass on black and tardy wing,
I know, will leave me—ah ! me, wretched cow !
A chewed-up, blinded piece of string.

The latest news of a turn-out by Port
Darwin blacks goes to prove the correctness of the
doctrine that “you never can trust a black-
fellow.” The leaders in this Port Darwin out-
rage had worked for teamster John Mulligan for
15 years, and were considered safe and trust-
worthy ! Always make the nigger keep in front.
Criminal lunatics were lately removed
from Hobart Gaol, at considerable expenses, in
order to provide separate quarters for first
offenders. Nevertheless, first offenders and
“old hands” are indiscriminately mixed dur-
ing work, leisure and meal hours! The Hobart
first offender, committed for 24 hours, has a tough
time. He is measured, weighed, examined as to
marks, &0., dressed in prison “ uniform,” and
photo’d, and by the time the performance is all
over his sentence has about expired. Any unfor-
tunate drunk who can’t pay ss. fine has the satis-
faction of knowing that his photo, is duly in-
serted in the album along with those of thieves,
murderers, &c., and duly displayed to visitors. By-
the-by, if ever a big fire should occur in Hobart
Gaol, both warders and prisoners stand a good
show of blazing up to Heaven together, for cells
and gaol are all locked up at night, and the
almost innumerable keys are kept at a safe dis-
tance away, with apparently no provision made
for giving an alarm.

SATURDAY, JULY 6, 1895.
The Bogan Bridge at Monkey and
Other Matters.
On the same day that the Reid Government
announced its intention of dissolving N.S. W.
Assembly and appealing to the electors for
another “mandate,” it also announced a
new loan of £3,000,000, and issued the loan
estimates for the financial year which com-
menced on Ist July. The haste with which
these have been produced naturally suggests
that they are intended to appeal to the soul
of the elector, and make him feel good
towards the Ministry at a time when material
support is urgently wanted. The nature of
the proposals confirms this impression. Out
of a total of £2,516,500, the sum of £977,400
is to be spent in repayment of old 5 per cent,
loans falling due a few months hence, and as
this conversion will save the country about
£14,000 per annum in interest, the transac-
tion is, so far, highly commendable. About
£450,000 is to be expended on railway works,
and as these will produce at least some kind
of an income, and will thus defray part of
the interest on the money borrowed, this
outlay is excusable according to the shiftless
methods of Australian finance. The rail-
ways, it is true, are all iu remote regions
where returns will probably be limited, and
a good deal of money goes in “trial sur-
veys,” which are not* reproductive works in
any lier J sense ; still, the railway expendi-
ture may, as a whole, be set down as a more or
lessreproductiveiuvestment. These two items
cover all that can, by any possibility, be
called honest finance. About £1,100,000
is to be fooled away on all manner of petty,
unproductive works throughout the length
and breadth of the country, and is appar-
ently intended for two purposes. One of
these is to create a bogus surplus and an
aspect of sham economy by charging to loans
£1,100,000 worth of current expenditure,
whereby the Reid Government will be able
to brag hereafter that it reduced the year’s
outgoings by a very large amount. The
other is to corruptly influence che, electors
by promising everybody all over the country
that his bridge, or his reclamation job, or
his artesian bore, will be forthcoming if the
present mean little Ministry gets back to
office.
• # #
The schedule of works to be effected
with this million pounds, or more, of bor-
rowed money, is a far-jreaching affair. It
covers more asylum accommodation for the
poor ; a reclamation job at Rushcutter s
Bay, Sydney, which work will prevent the
carcase of the dead and gas-inflated dog
floating up against the back-doors at Darling
Point ; dredging works, &c., at seven
different harbors ; additions to a number of
public offices in Sydney; a vast number of
small sewerage Avorks ; metallurgical works,
experimental farms, artesian bores ; a drain
at Mosman’s Bay (Sydney) ; and a grant
“for straightening the course of Styx and
Throsby Creeks.” Also, there are grants for
a new wharf at Manly ; for alterations to a
wharf at Woolloomooloo ; for a lighter ; for
alterations to some old dredges ; a number
of small sums, from £6OOO down to £6OO,
for country lock-ups, &c. ; a punt; about 30
bridges over various creeks in the back-
blocks, including one “ over the Bogan River
at Monkey ; ” repairs to two old bridges 5
four roads in different parts of the coTintry ;
a sum of £25,000 for “ thinning out
forests (!);” £lOO,OOO for “ clearing lands
and an especially shameless swindle where-
by two Sydney streets are to be wood-
blocked out of the loan-funds instead of —
as they ought to be—out of local rates.
Even the worst perverters of the vicious
borrowing system among past New South
Wales Treasurers never went quite so far in
the way of shunting their current obliga-
tions on to posterity, or “faked ’ the public
accounts quite so brazenly as this.
# * *
The Bulletin holds that foreign borrow-
ing is utterly thriftless, vicious and inex-
cusable under all circumstances, inasmuch as
the foreign mortgagee drains the country of
money in the shape of interest, and re-
presents the absentee curse in its worst
form. And it holds that local borrowing is
excusable only when the proceeds are in-
vested in public works of a directly repro-
ductive character, and which hold out
reasonable promise of paying, at no
very distant date, the entire interest
on their cost. The rule as to the
investment of loan money in reproductive
works has been so far recognised that all
Treasurers profess, in a general sort of
way, to follow it. That they do not live up
to their professions is evidenced by the fact
that barely four-fifths of the N. S.W. public
debt has been incurred for works of a directly
revenue-producing character, while rather
more than one-fifth has been expended on
non-productive works, which ought distinctly
to have been charged to current revenue. But
outof the£1,516,000 which represents the pro-
posed new loan expenditure of 1895-96, Pre-
mier Reid intends to spend over £1,000,000
(or more than two-thirds) on works which
yield no revenue whatever. That unspeakable
financier, whose whole political existence is a
hypocritical protest against the dishonesty of
his predecessors, economises on the revenue
by charging roads, bridges, punts, river im-
provements, harbor improvements, street
repairs, wharf repairs, bridge repairs, the
patching of superannuated dredges—almost
all the current Public Works expenditure,
in fact—to posterity. He passes on the
responsibility with a whole-souled unscrupu-
lousness of which not even the worst of
previous Treasurers was capable. Therefore,
his surplus, if he has one, is a political
swindle, and his deficit, if he has one, is
a political swindle likewise, inasmuch as
the surplus is arrived at by not paying
current liabilities out of current revenue,
and the deficit is represented at many hun-
dreds of thousands ,below its real amount by
the same process. Further, G. H. Reid’s
alleged reductions in the national expendi-
ture are a sham, t being effected, not by
economy or wise administration, but by the
clumsy expedient of leaving the 'bill to
posterity.
* * #
If the aforesaid £1,100,000 represented
some exceptional public works which required
to be done only once in the nation’s history,
then, even despite their unreproductive
character, there might be some semblance of
an excuse for this wholesale shunting of the
responsibility. But they stand on a wholly
different footing. The making of new roads
is a regular item of expenditure ; population
keeps increasing, and settlement expands
in hitherto roadless districts, and more new
roads must continue to be made every year
and all the year round for centuries to come.
England—a mere speck of ground by com-
parison—has been making roads for 1900
years, and is not finished even yet. Also,
the country must keep on building new
bridges constantly for 500 years or more ;
almost every new road, or new township, or
new area thrown open for selection involves
the erection of more bridges to furnish
means of access. Likewise the rivers that
are dredged this year will require to be
dredged again next year and every succeed-
year, or, if they don’t, other rivers will ;
and the demand for new gaols and lock-ups
and post-offices is perennial while population
keeps on growing larger ; and water con-
servation will be an annual charge on the
revenue for ages to come ; and the highway
which is wood-blocked to-day will want
the process repeated at regular intervals
so long as it remains a highway.
Also, the repaired dredge and the patched
bridge won’t last for ever, and the State
forests will require to be thinned regularly
so long as they are forests. Therefore, when
Premier Retd proposes to leave posterity to
pay its own bill for all these works, and to
pay his bill as well, he is guilty of a mean
evasion of his responsibilities and perpe-
trates a gross political swindle on the gener-
ation which is to come, in addition to the
many similar swindles of his predecessors.
# # #
The late Dibbs Government sinned in
the same fashion, and so also did the
Pakkes Government Vhich preceded it, and
many others. But Premier Reid professes
to have introduced an altogether new era of
economy and strict honesty, and he has
expatiated to utter weariness about the
frauds, iniquities, misrepresentations, and
financial jugglery of his predecessors ; there-
fore it is a truly lamentable thing to find
him following in their footsteps. It is still
more lamentable to find that he is much
worse in this respect than any of his dismal
forerunners, and his snuffle is an aggravation
of his offence, and his professions of radical
reform in financial matters are mere gratui-
tous hypocrisy. The record of Premier Reid,
so far as the Treasury is concerned, may be
summed up in a few sentences. He “ faked ’
his first financial statement by charging’
£216,000 of his expenditure to his prede-
cessors and dating the outlay back in order to
fix the responsibility on some one else.
He “faked” his second one by omitting
from the estimates over £200,000, which
must be provided, according to various acts
of Parliament, for charges on the public
debt ; and by taking credit in every case for
12 months’ revenue while only providing, in
many cases, for 11 months’ expenditure—
the last month’s expenditure being peace-
fully shunted over into next year. He
further manipulated the public balance-sheet
by chaiging to loan account over £300,000
which his predecessors had already paid out
of revenue, and taking that huge sum
out of loan funds, and including it in
current receipts. He produced a bogus and
artificial appearance of solvency by charging
expenditure for roads, bridges, repairs, &c.,
to loan account on a more reckless and
shameless system than that of all the shame-
less politicians who went before him. And
he has made hardly one genuine reduction
of expenditure, save by cutting miserable
sums off the miserably small votes for the
relief of destitute children, aged and sick
aboriginals, for hospital and asylum grants,
for maintenance of the sick poor in infir-
maries, for benevolent asylums, for food to
prisoners in lock-ups, and the like. All
these have been retrenched with a lavish
hand, and they are almost the only items
which have been retrenched. Also the small
allowance for the defence of penniless
prisoners charged with capital offences has
apparently been abolished. These things
practically make up the whole of the Reid
Ministry's economics up to date.
» # *
The visible cause of all this is the incapa-
city and political dishonesty of a feeble
Premier and a feeble scratch Ministry. But
part of the responsibility rests upon the
community, which is miserably ignorant and
stupidly indifferent in matters of political
economy, and part rests with the system of
Government by Contradiction. The first
duty of a Ministry is to keep itself in office.
To do this it must placate the country as a
whole by decreasing, or, at least, by not
increasing, the taxes ; and it must placate
the constituencies individually by giving
them more roads, bridges, gaols, post-offices,
court-houses, dredges, lunatic - asylums,
breakwaters, and wood-blocked highways
than did its predecessors. Also it has to
placate politicians and influential supporters
with billets in the over-grown Public Service,
and it must show a surplus, or explain that
the other fellow is alone responsible for the
absence of one. Therefore, the ordinary
politician cares not a straw whether his
accounts are honest or not—all he wants is
that they should look honest. Also he takes
no account whether the Treasury is solvent
or not, so long as it appears solvent. If
New South Wales ever raises a thoroughly
honest Treasurer, then it will hear some
new and very surprising truths. For
he will tell it that the demand for reduced
taxation is an absurdity, and that it is not
the business of a Treasurer to reduce taxes
—that it is necessary to save at least
£1,000,000 per annum off the ordinary ex-
penditure—and that, when that is accom-
plished, it is necessary to raise £500,000
more revenue each year to cover the outlay
on essential public works which, being not
directly productive of revenue, cannot, on
any honest principle, be executed with bor-
rowed money. Further, he will insist on
the establishment of a sinking-fund for the
extinction of the public debt, on the ground
that the Government is eating up the national
assets by turning the public lands into
revenue, and that to use up the national
assets to meet present expenditure is bad,
but to use them up and yet leave our present
expenditure as a debt upon posterity is abso-
lute ruin. And he will probably add that
the country has drivelled far too much
already about its magnificent resources,
which are nothing so extraordinary after all;
and about its splendid future, which has
been growing more and more remote for
seventy years and more ; that it has been
living all along in a fool’s paradise, regard-
less of the morrow ; and that it will require
twenty years of hard work and depression to
put things moderately straight. Wherei pun
the country will probably decide that that
honest financier is a lunatic, or a Russian
spy, or an anarchist, and cast him out ac-
cordingly. Considering all things, The
Bulletin is not at all sure that G. H. Reid
is not as good a leader as the people who
made him what he is deserve. And that is
about the hardest thing which has been said
about them this century.
The People and Business.
Why should not the people do their own busi-
ness? Why should great industries —such as
can be made to pay—always be reserved as
happy hunting-grounds for the enterprising
capitalist? Why should the State be expected
to put up with Fat Man’s leavings and be con-
tent to set up institutions and manage them
only when there is no profit to be expected
from them ? We are told that the State can’t
do business. Innumerable individuals, each
working alone, can do business and make a suc-
cess thereof. They band themselves together
into companies, and often do better still. Then
the companies coalesce into rings and trusts,
and the bigger they are the stronger they grow
and the more they make. Yet their friends
want us to believe that the strongest and
broadest company possible, a real Democratic
State, must fail in business. A truly Demo*
cratic State— i. e., the People, is the only
honest ring, the only trustworthy trust, the
only clean pool. It is the only big institution
which does not exist for the purpose of making
money out of the sweat of the workers.
The meaning of an ordinary big commer-
cial undertaking now is that a certain
number of more or less smarj; men try to make
a good thing out of the people’s works and
wants. Why shouldn’t the people make the
good thing for themselves? Why should the
giant majority for ever be led and bled by
pigmy minorities ?
* * •
Fat Man’s friends say that business, to be
successful, must be managed by Heaven-born
financiers. Where are they ? (Some who were
called such are in Darlinghurst or Pentridge,
and are much lonelier there than they ought to
be. The story of Australian Heaven-born
finance is written in panic, suspension and re-
construction. We are paying in calls and
losses, in depression and despair, for the fling
which that inspired person, the financial
genius, had at our expense a few years ago.
Could the State do worse than the Fat Man ?
Certainly not. Could the State do better ?
Why not try ? The modern bank is supposed
to be the choicest flower of private financial
genius. All the talent, all the knowledge, all
the thickness of skin and hardness of heart of
the nineteenth - century business man go to
build up these safe strongholds for capital,
these castles of commerce, flow their managers
anil directors have laughed at the crude
bungling efforts of young democracies to man-
age their own affairs ! There was nothing
democratic in a bank, anyway : the Fat Man
thanked God for that. We are not quite sure
how many banks there are in Australia which
did not reconstruct the year before last, but it
does not matter much. There are not enough
of them to waste time over. There would have
been fewer still had not that clumsy, pitiful,
despised thing, the State, kindly bridged the
gulf with Banking Acts. Capital had to
come to Democracy to be saved.
« * *
So it was, too, in Maoriland. There the
province’s biggest bank went down on its
knees to Dick Seddon and the Labor-
party last winter and wept and begged
and prayed for help—or else the shutters
would go up next Monday morning. And
burly, big-fisted Dick gave the help. But the
Maorilanders don’t mean to let their bank play
fast and loose with the country again. The
State appoints the bank’s chairman and audi-
tor now, and keeps a veto up the Trea-
surer’s sleeve. Thus the Maorilanders have let
their State go into banking. Well, they cannot
make more of a mess of it than their private
capitalists made. Moreover, the State is used
to doing business over there. Twenty-five
years ago it started a life-insurance office. In
spite of all that private enterprise can do for
outside insurance companies in touting, can-
vassing, puffing and blowing, the State beats
them at their own game. Maorilanders
for their numbers do more life - insur-
ing than any other nation in the world,
and their National office insures as many
of them as all their private offices put
together. It charges the lowest rates ; it gives
bigger bonuses than most; it beats every office
of its own age out of sight in economy of
working expenses. The office began in a small
way and much distrusted. Its policies now
come to nine millions sterling, and last year
3000 men and 253 women went on to its books.
All sorts and conditions in Maoriland pin their
faith to it. Its policy-holders range from a
chaff-cutter to a Chief Justice, and from
sausage-makers down to bank-managers. More-
over, in Maoriland, thanks to the State Trust
Office, you can leave your property in trust or
die intestate, with a certainty that your children
won’t be robbed by friendly trustees, or be
fleeced by respectable lawyers. • The province
will act as your trustee or administra-
trator, and unless you are pig-headed you will
choose no other. The Public Trust Office of
Maoriland has now the care of a million and a-
half of property. It manages cheaply and
does not steal, keeps ruin from pouncing on the
widow and the orphan, and won’t let even
lunatics be robbed. The office is 23 years old.
Property-owners looked shyly at it at first, but
they know better now. Why in such matters
as these must Australia always let the Maori-
landers get there first ? If the people can do
their own business on one side of the Tasman
Sea, why not on the other ? There is more to
do on our side, let us remember ? Our business
men have had a long trial. Their incompetency
is the talk of the world. Let the long-suffer-
ing people take a turn at the work. It is the
People’s own.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Oath!
“A' ’broad-minded Persian lately tried to knock
a little common-sense into the administration of
ilie oath in'a Melb. police-court. It goes with-
out saying that the attempt failed. The Persian
witness was about to be sworn in the usual way
when the Bench objected, on the ground that
lie hadn’t been converted to the Christian faith.
As an enlightened Mahomeddan, “ but not the
same as a Hindoo,” the man saw no difference
between the Bible and the Koran for swearing
purposes. The Bench, with true Christian
fatuity, .persisted that a Persian conscience
could not accept the official Australian oath on
its native merits. The witness, who had already
been there on several occasions, and was “quite
used to it,” suggested a little religious tolera-
tion on the part of the pious beaks. “I have
been here living 25 years,” said the Oriental,
“and it’s all the same at my church, this
book —we tell truth before one great God.
Any book do.” But there remained the
solemn fact that Christian missionaries are
sent forth to expound Terewth to men who
associate God with more than one Book, conse-
quently the Bench called for the Koran and
ordered the rational foreigner to confine his
conscience to the oath of his ancestors. And
when a greasy Koran had been substituted for
a greasy Bible the clerk of courts remembered
ids own unfitness to administer an oath upon
an un-English volume, so the case was
adjourned for a few days, in order that a
qualified interpreter might swear the Persian
worshipper of one great cosmopolitan God
according to the only conscience which Anglo-
Australian law gives him credit for. Mean-
while, a mild agitation for church union is
understood to be occurring in these parts. The
bishops of rival Christian denominations discuss
the hopelessness of this agitation. They stand
on opposite shores, so to speak, and smugly con-
template the awful width of the gulf which
separates them. Also, they wrangle as to the
respective merits of their denominations in the
matter of carrying the Word into unbelieving
hearts. Likewise, they would rather die, or
debar themselves of several luxuries, than con-
sent to be sworn on the opposition creed’s book
of common prayer. But they agree in recog-
nising the precious divinity of the Jewish
Bible, and the majesty of the law which holds
that same Bible sacred to Jews and Christians
oidy, and, as for any simple Mahommedan who
believes in one great God above all other re-
ligious considerations—well, for a poor be-
nighted creature who brackets several works of
pious fiction together, the bishops feel a pro-
found, though decidedly unpleasant, pity.
Which is not surprising when we remember
that bishoprics are built on bigotries, and each
bigotry is built on its own particular book. To
say that any book written to the glory of God
will do is to blaspheme against the most in-
fluential recipients of holy orders.

Municipal Socialism.
Editor Bulletin, —The reason the democracy
does, not get control of the municipal bodies is
partly that it does not try, but mostly because
it cannot. The flying of the democratic, or, to
be more accurate, the labor flag, at Broken Hill,
where are the safest Parliamentary seats for
labor in New South Wales, at once settles a
municipal candidate’s chances. There R.
Sleath, now labor member for Wilcannia, five
times unsuccessfully contested municipal seats.
1% Bulletin would not have municipal one-
mah-one-vote (and I quite agree); but how
shall we equitably modify the system under
which capitalistic control is so nearly abso-
lute as it now is in municipal affairs? But,
anyway, no one but a perfectly rabid, factional
democrat would vote for certain typical
democratic candidates. Why is it that these
everywhere are so often unclean persons
(physically as well as morally) whom it
were a nightmare to conceive representing
one in any capacity: tactless people who be-
lieve that blunt utterance of their extreme per-
sonal likes arid dislikes and a brutal treading
upon corns shows sincerity and earnestness;
that stupid bombast is the highest form of in-
tellectual oratory ? The dull pork-butcher, the
befuddled publican, the cheap-jack auctioneer
—these as aldermen are bad enough, but they
shine by comparison with the typical would-be
labor alderman. Let me say that the men who
would best fill the aldermanic and Mayoral
offices seldom appear in municipal life.
Generally when they do the quasi-democratic
pack yelps at their heels because they
quietly work instead of striking dramatic
attitudes arid uttering windy speeches, or
making’ “ scenes ” in the council chamber—
until they retire in disgust. Or else they never
seek to sit in the council chamber, but rightly
understand without the need of experience how
hard and thankless is the work, and how false
the position of the honest alderman. They
know how very small is the municipal stage,
and Bow insignificant the figures which strut
upon it. They know these things, and wisely
prefer the eminence of private life to. the obscu-
rity of the municipal council chamber.—Yours,
Broken Hill.
The One-Eyed Law.
At Invercargill (M.L.), in 1887, a small farmer
named Meikle was convicted of sheep-stealing
on the evidence of one Lambert, and sent to
gaol for seven years. In these days an accused
person was not allowed to give evidence on his
own behalf, neither could he call his wife as a
witness for the defence, and Melkle’s case was
considerably discounted thereby. Also, the
matter was hustled through so rapidly that
there was insufficient time to collect evidence,
neither was there much money available, and
accused, being shut up in gaol, could do nothing
on his own account, and the police, as usual,
worked up their side of the case only. Meikle,
therefore, served his term in gaol, and came <• >i b
to find a new law in force whereby an ac'cu ed
person and his wife could both give evidence.
Also, he had now time to hunt up the informa-
tion which, was so badly wanted and so carefully
suppressed in 1887- As the result he hauled up
the informer, Lambert, for perjury, and proved
that that person was drunk in a neighboring
town on the day when he claimed to have seen
the crime committed. Also he proved a con-
clusive alibi for himself, and convinced the
court that his son, who was said to have been
an accomplice in the theft, was then confined to
bed with an illness from which he never re-
covered. And the court thereupon found
Lambert guilty, and sent him to hard labor for
four years. This is at least something, yet it
is a miserably unsatisfactory conclusion. Lam-
bert was a well-known resident, and it seems
hardly possible that he could be howlingly
drunk in a small country town without the
police being aware of it, and if they were aware
of it, then it would seem that the information
was suppressed on the good old theory that it
is the* business of the police to get convictions
—to convict somebody or anybody under
any kind of circumstances. The fact that
young Meikle was physically incapable of
committing the crime charged against him
also looks like a matter which the police
must or should have been more or less ac-
quainted with. Likewise, both these facts must
have been known to other people who were
apparently too tired to come forward. The
ridiculous ease with which Meikle was con-
victed on the thinnest kind of a case, merely
for want of some experienced person to hunt up
the evidence, which was lying round in all
directions, suggests that many other people
may be doing terms in gaol from exactly the
same cause. It likewise suggests that the
administration of justice will continue to be an
iniquitous farce until a Crown Defence Depart-
ment is created to counterbalance the one-sided
sinfulness of the Crown Prosecutor. The local
“Crown” might inquire into the Meikle case
seriously, and draw some valuable lessons there-
from. And when it is doing so, it might
also seriously consider its own position in the
matter. The Crown went to great expense to
convict Meikle on the evidence of the shady
Lambert, but when it became a matter of con-
victing Lambert on the evidence of Meikle
the latter had to stand all the trouble and ex-
pense himself, the Crown apparently being too
exhausted to interfere. These aspects of the
Meikle-Lambert case deserve the considera-
tion of every respectable person who wants to
keep out of gaol. Every person who is satis-
fied with the law as it now stands is liable to
discover any day, by personal experience, how
absurdly easy it is to convict almost any person
of almost anything, under the present one-sided
system. Also, he fully deserves to make that
discovery personally.
A Local Government Problem.
It was proposed, under the deceased N.S.W.
Local Government Bill, to restrict local taxation
to Is. 3d. in the £ on rental value, or three-
farthings in the £ on the unimproved capital
value. A recent valuation made at Invercargill
(M. L.) throws some light on the miserable in-
adequacy of the aforesaid three-farthings. The
local rate there equals 2s. in the £ of rental, and
a valuation recently made shows that a tax of
betWeeu 4d. and sd. in the £ of unimproved
capital value will be required to produce the
same income. Therefore, it would seem that
when the N.S.W. Local Government Bill is
again introduced, the proposed three-farthings
should be at least 2d. to give the unimproved
value tax anything like a fair show. It is
remarkable that in Maoriland, where local
bodies may levy rates either on annual
rental or on unimproved capital values, the
great majority of towns and boroughs levy on
annual rental, the reason assigned being that
this method of taxation gets at the rich man
much more effectually than the other. The
Invercargill valuation shows that under the
unimproved value tax the business and swell
residential portion of the town would pay
much less than it now does, while in the
suburban localities where workmen mostly have
their dwellings, therates would be increased from
200 to 500 per cent. The typical swell residence
consists of a £2OOO house planted on £5OO worth
of ground—total, £2500; the workman’s cottage
represents, perhaps, £lOO worth of house on a
little £lOO allotment—total, £2OO. Therefore,
under the rental valuation, the rich man is
taxed on £2500, and the poor man on £2OO, so
of their joint liability the latter pays less than
one-thirteenth. But if they are taxed on un-
improved land-value only, the capitalist pays
on £5OO and the workman on £lOO, so the latter
pays one-sixth of the total, or more than twice
as much as at present. That is how things pan
out in Invercargill, anyhow, and when next the
New South Wales Local Government Bill copies
along the Labor-party should look up this point
carefully. It is just possible that it has been
unconsciously endeavoring to lump the local
taxation chiefly on its own class, and to let the
capitalist go almost scot free.

Australia’s Bankruptcy Sale.
The Argus strikes half of a great truth ;
There is only one market in ttie world that is now open
to them (the Victorian farmers), viz, the English market,
and if that were closed the results would he exceedingly'
disastrous to them. The irony of the position is that Vic-
torian Protectionists, to he consistent, have to advocate
the closing of the English market to Victorian produce.
Or, in other words, they have to work for the ruin of the
colony.
The first half of this is a solemn and awful
truth. Victoria pays the interest on its ex-
ternal debt by exporting butter, cheese, wheat,
and wool to Great Britain. If Britain gave
Protection to its agriculturists, then it would
still buy the wool, as usual, for wool-growing
requires a vast area of laud, which the little
North Sea isles do not possess. But it would
probably so enlarge its own agricultural yield
that it could do without the butter and cheese
and wheat, and, if it didn’t take them, Victoria
would very likely be unable to pay its interest,
and would have to default. N.S.W., with
its huge wool-producing area, might pull
through under these circumstances, but the
position of the smaller province would be pre-
carious. This doesn’t show' that Protection is
bad, but it does show most conclusively that
foreign borrowing is a lamentable mistake.
Australia can’t export the interest on its foreign
debt in sovereigns, for it doesn’t produce enough
of them for the purpose, so it has to pay
in goods. Under the protective system so
many countries are almost self-supporting, that
for most of these goods there is only one
niarket left, and if Britain abandons Freetrade
then there will be practically no market at all.
Therefore Victorian Protectionists don’t advo-
cate the closing of the English market against
their goods, they only advocate the closing of
their market -against English goods. And as
Protection, like Freetrade, is a purely selfish
regard for our own interests, they are perfectly
consistent. But for her foreign borrowings,
Australia could get on about as well with the
English markets closed as with them open,
but because of these borrowings she is reduced
to a state of helpless dependence on an
English buyer, and if he fails the bottom falls
out of things in general. Foreign borrowing
lias reduced this country to the state of the
insolvent drapery man who is always selling off
at an alarming sacrifice to meet a bill that is
falling due. There is a huge ticket constantly
TSxed outside the front door of this continent:
“ These Goods to be Sold Regardless of Cost.”
And if some day they aren’t sold in time there
will be serious trouble.
Sydney Telegraph publishes a letter from a
.“well-known farmer”—whom he is well-known
to is unstated—showing that Protection doesn’t
help agriculture, and comments thereon in an
enthusiastic leading article. The farmer’s name
and his letter is one more proof that
figures can be made to prove anything if they
are turned the right way for the purpose. Says
the well-known farmer, speaking of New South
Wales:—
The following- figures, taken from published returns for
quinquennial periods dating from 1860, clearly show
this:—ln 1800 the acreage under cultivation was 260,798 ;
in 1865, 378,254; in 1870, 426,976 ; in 1875, 451,139; in
1880, 706,493 ; in 1883, 868,093. I have not before me the
return for 1890, but that for 1895 was 1,325,814 acres.
Now, if we take the decade from 1875 to 1885, we find the
increase in that period was 416,954 acres, and from 1885,t0
1895 the increase is 457,721 —a very small increase indeed,
and this with a largely increased population.
This shows clearly, of course, that agriculture
progressed as fast in New South Wales under
Foreign-trade as under Protection. But if Mr.
Clout hadn’t omitted the 1890 statistics—which
he could have got from exactly the same source
as the other ones ; and if he hadn’t garbled
his figures by including some 300,000 acres
of grass lands in his estimates for the Free-
trade period up to 1885, and not includ-
ing them in his estimates for the Protective
period in 1895, then the result wouldn’t have
been of a kind that the Telegraph would
care to publish. When the permanent grass-
lands are included all round, then the solemn
facts are that the increase in three years of
Protection was equal to the best record put up
in ten years of Foreign-trade. It is just
possible that Mr. Clout —if there really is such
a person—was ignorant of this discrepancy in
his own figures, but the Telegraph could
hardly share that ignorance, and its joyous
endorsement of Clout’s assertions, which are
utterly destroyed by one glance at Coghlan’s
1894 “Statistical Survey,” looks perilously like
hard lying. When the D.T. gets on fiscal
statistics it is about the most conscienceless
publication that ever existed.
♦
The estimated cost of administration in New
South Wales for the year June ’95 to June ’96
— i.e., the cost of the great aggregate Civil
Service dude—is .£4,671,348, or just <£20,000
below the estimates, which the present Premier
denounced as “wildly extravagant,” for 1894.
And yet this is the branch in which, above all
others, savings should be effected. The
.£700,000 or so which it is proposed to “save ”
on the total expenditure is all made up either
by charging a vast amount of the ordinary road
and bridge expenditure and casual repairs to
loans, or else by postponing a large part
of the unavoidable charges of the public
debt to next year, and these are not
savings. The administrative services are
now run in Victoria for a little over
two millions, and even allowing for the larger
area and slightly larger population of N.S.
Wales, the latter province should get through
with ease on three millions. But thisis just where
the great retrenchment idiocy comes in. No
Government ever retrenches seriously except in
times of utter insolvency. Then it cuts down
unprofitable expenditure to avoid making itself
unpopular by new taxation, but, when things
improve the bill at once starts to expand
again. The fact which New South Wales
wants to look at with a hard, cold,, brutal
eye is that by the appointment of a really
econo.nical Cabinet it could easily save a million
and three-quarters annually off the cost of
departmental administration, and with that
sum to spend it could have a perpetual blow-out
of new roads and bridges, and could revel in
new railways and water-conservation works,
without loading itself down with taxation to
pay interest on fresh loans. In fact, N.S. Wales
could have a gorge of public works without a
cent of extra cost—if it only had sense enough
to seize the opportunity. The kind of men who
will make this, saving can always be found in
times of dreadful scarcity— Atkinson, Bal-
lance, and Turner are evidences to that effect
—and they could also be found at other times if
the community would look for them. But the
community never does look for them at these
other times.
Down South the legislators are concerning
themselves with the alleged entertainments
given by music-hall performers on Sunday
nights. The churches’ feel that they alone have
the right to take up a collection after a pitiful
performance, and they naturally resent the
competition of the music-halls. The music-
halls do their best to encourage the Sunday-
evening sleep to which the population has
accustomed itself. The windy baritone sings
the pathetic ballad about “The Cast in Mother’s
Eye,” and you could hear a brick drop while he
sings. The favorite comique comes forward
with an air of being in mourning for the death
of humor, and he chants “ There’s a Monkey to
Spare at the Zoo,” and the orchestra, con-
sisting of two fiddles and the drums, gives
him an encore, which he takes with unspeak-
able courage. Only this, and a little more like
it, and the collection—yet the churches, and
the Honorable Balfour, object. The churches
likewise object to the opening of libraries and
art-galleries on Sunday : the rich man may look
at hia books and pictures on Sunday, but the
people may not look at theirs. The churches
object to Sunday trains: the rich man may
order out his conveyance—the people should
not be allowed to ride in theirs. All this is
excellent bluff, and the Fat Man smiles as he sees
the elfect. The population that is controlled
by Fat Man’s friends will not touch Fat Man’s
vested rights.
Dear Bulletin, —The “meejum of exchange”
is perhaps the most unfittest thing for a public
debate. In most social and political questions
the appeal to individual experience is possible,
and facts of common knowledge can be freely
used without creating a fog. But statistics
are not matters of common knowledge, and
statistics are absolute!}' essential to the most
elementary wrangle about the “meejum of
exchange.” Where a matter of feeling or sym-
pathy is concerned a mixed audience might be
expected to come to a reasonable conclusion
instinctively. But with statistics, one set of
figures is played off against another, and the
audience is asked to choose on the spur of the
moment between the two—when, as a matter
of fact, they probably are both cross-eyed.
Cross-eyed statistics have no perspective. They
look on man as if at some particular moment
he were isolated from every modifying influence
but one. It is the privilege of the faddist to
cut his statistics to fit his arguments —and the
wonder is that the public finds any merit
in the performance. A proper discussion of
the “ meejum of exchange ” would not go
through the post for a penny, as Paula
Tanqueray thought her life story would.
Such a discussion would include the philosophy
of war and industrialism and trade. The wars
of the present century that have affected certain
countries so vitally—the Napoleonic wars, the
Crimean war, the civil war in America, the
Indian “ mutiny,” the Franco-Prussian war—
all these have accentuated or modified the evils
or advantages which the “meejum of exchange”
is fondly represented to have been entirely re-
sponsible for. Thenthequestion of harvests must
be considered, and the relative importance of a
bad European season early in the century and
a bad European season now. The alternation
of boom and burst, in spite of all sorts of new
factors, is perhaps more important to the dis-
cussion than even the marvellous gold dis-
coveries in the fifties, and the marvellous silver
discoveries of latter days. The birth of inven-
tion, the progress of mechanical skill, the effect
of improved banking systems and practice, the
elasticity and breaking-point of credit, the
opening-up of new countries, the electric tele-
graph, trades unionism and public sentiment,
fiscal systems, political systems, social condi-
tions, &c., are likewise concerned. How can
such an array of problems be dishcd-up in a
speech lasting a few minutes ? The thing is
absurd, and Frewen and Max Hirsch are so
much wasted energy.—F.
The simple and effective Torrens Title almost
abolished the great conveyancing swindle in
Australia, and nearly wiped out the large
revenue which the legal profession used to
extract from the public for muddling learnedly
among confused deeds, grants, transfers and
other barren wastes of parchment concerning
the ownership of land. Another great saving
of time and money, and another great assist-
ance towards the extinction of a non-producing
class, might be effected if the State undertook
to prepare indefeasible wills as well as inde-
feasible land-titles. It would be a simple
matter to establish a public' office, where
every man could have his will prepared
cheaply by the best legal talent in the
country, overhauled, as a further guarantee
against errors, by two or three first-class
lawyers, and his heirs insured by payment of a
small sum against any possible loss of their
inheritance through flaws in the document.
The same department could take charge of the
will, obtain probate at a low rate when the
testator died, and hand over everything in
correct form to the executors. Further, it
might be enacted that the wills so prepared
could not, under any circumstances, be called
in question on mere technical grounds. Such a
department, as an adjunct to a Public Trust
office to take charge of the property and act as
trustee and executor, would reduce many useless
solicitors, barristers, &c., to contribute to the
public wealth by agriculture or some otherhonest
pursuit. Even saying nothing about the fact
that the entire property often goes in litigation,
no country is rich enough to support a tribe of
learned counsel, who do nothing in return for
their board and lodging and wig save move
occasionally for probate in the will of Jones,
deceased. That six or eight large, muscular
persons of mature age should be moving for
probate in as many miserable little £BO or £lOO
estates, while outside the court a feeble little
man is'trying to shovel up two tons of sand in
30 minutes, is a pitiable instance of wasted
energy. A clerk at £5 a week from the Govern-
ment department could move successfully for
all the probates in Melbourne or Sydney, and
do office work the other three days in the week,
and still be home by five every evening.

Dear Bulletin, —Re a press paragraph
stating that a woman in Milparinka (N.S. W.) has
got two months’ gaol for refusing to work as a
domestic servant after signing a contract. A
better example of the crass ignorance of country
magistrates could not be afforded. The conviction
was under the 3rd section of the “ Masters and
Servants Act cf 1857 ” (20 Vic. No. 2S). But their

The Dacres made a new departure on
Saturday, when a large audience gathered at Her
Majesty’s to see Grundy’s “Bunch of Violets,”
and expressed its cordial and even enthu-
siastic approval of that honored vegetable all
through four acts. At the end of the third act
especially, when the full of the herb
had just dawned on the house, nothing less than
a double recall could express its feelings.
Grundy’s play is a fine production in every respect,
and is also a bitter satire on nearly everybody.
The gallery might have felt inclined to resent the
picture of the Federated Sons of Toil, who are
the hardest-looking set of Domain loafers on
record, if it were not that the capitalistic hero is
such a finished and unspeakable hypocrite that
things are about even. Grundy’s hero is a com-
pound of Jabez Balfour, Merdle, Law, the City of
Glasgow Bank directors, the South Sea Bubble,
the Australian Banking Co., Mirams’ umbrella,
the Mercantile Bank, and the men who
salted Taranganba. He was a Sunday-
school teacher in early life, and seduced
the nicest girl in his class. Then he rises to a,
baronetcy and to a giddy eminence on the summit
of a cronk bank and a huge insolvent insurance
00. He nearly gets into .Parliament on the Non-
conformist snuffle ticket; nearly sells a gravel-pit
as a diamond-mine to a Yorkshire brewer for
i 6100,000 ; nearly hoodwinks his saint-like wife—
nearly does everything, in fact. And then the
whole show goes down like a house of cards. The
Sunday-school girl, whom, it seems, he had rashly
married to prevent exposure, turns up and
shatters his domestic happiness by cackling, in a
brassy fashion, about “the past.” The diamond-
mine doesn’t sell; the election is lost; the bank
bursts ; the bottom falls out of the insurance co.;
the abject confidential clerk cleans out the fallen
saint; the trustees of his embezzled marriage
settlement send for the police; and he suicides
among the ruins like Sardanapalus when he burnt
himself on top of the grand piano in Nineveh
with all Assyria falling on his head.
* # •
According to all the moth-eaten conven-
tions, virtue ought to come uppermost in the end,
but Grundy sticks closely to the natural sequence
of things. The confidential clerk who rises on
the saint’s ruins is a bony, crawling being, much
wickeder and much cleverer than his master, and
he is left in a state of skinny exaltation gathering
up the property. The pious wife turns out
to be no wife, and the pious daughter is
illegitimate ; and they are both left penniless.
As for the brassy, cackling person who used to be
the good little Sunday-school girl, she is the
wicked wife of a millionaire and is rolling in
riches ; and the Federated Sons of Toil, who are a
bad, blotched, beery lot, are happy and drunk
when last heard from. Also, the banker doesn’t
die repentant, nor does he weep in his last
moments; he perishes dry like a bad old Roman
with his back up to the last. Therefore, The
Bulletin regards the “Bunch of Violets” as a
great play, and every depositor, who is living in
the hope that poetic justice will yet overtake the
manager and board of directors, should see it and
realise that poetic justice is a dreadfully bad shot,
and can’t hit an Alp with a brick at ten paces.
The conspicuously weak point in the drama is
that the banker is only a plausible ass after all;
with a little more brains and a little artistic lying
he might have flourished to the end of his days,
• * *
Mr. Dacre’s rendering of the banker is a
very powerful piece of work. His cold and saintly
wife, however—though Miss Amy Roselle plays
the part with great ability doesn’t appeal
strongly to the audience. The glacial saint is
always a depressing character, and though she
thaws on two memorable occasions, the general
effect is that of a very good woman out in a hard
winter. The silent, murky, soft-footed confiden-
tial clerk is done by Scot Inglis, who misses not
one single point in that person’s cat-like evolution.
Frank Harcourt, as the principal Federated Son
of Toil, and J. W. Sweeney, are two excellent
comedians. Miss Knights, however, is shrill and
indefinite, and the banker’s daughter—who, for-
tunately, doesn’t matter much—is a rather wooden
little girl and suggests a strictly moral and upright
doll. She has very little to do, however, and
might almost be represented by a telegram stating
that she is detained owing to a bad cold.

“A Gaiety Girl” is doing its third and
last week at Sydney Lyceum, and is still going
remarkably strong. All the johnnydom of the
city rolls up nightly to stare through an infatuated
eyeglass at Grace Palotta’s fair countenance, and
to worship the other houris, and, as every separate
female in the co, is an houri, more or less, this
great capacious reverence is a dreadful thing to
witness. The verdict up to date is that the pre-
sent 00. is the finest and most comprehensive
beauty-show which has yet visited Australia, and
every dude in Sydney would see his high collar
burnt at the stake before he went back on this
conviction. Some new and bewildering varia-
tions have been appended to the original high kick,
which was sufficiently dazzling in its former state,
and sundry new graces have been added every
now and then to the skirt dance. “ In Town,”
which, according to Melbourne’s general decision,
is even better than the “ Gaiety Girl,” is to be
staged on Saturday (July 6).
* * * «
Sydney Tivoli is still in splendid health,
and is crowded nightly almost to the doors. Very
much the same may be said of the York-Jones
combination at the Empire, and between the two
Sydney has got the variety fever very badly
indeed. The Lyceum may also be classed as
variety, though of a lofty and etherealised kind,
which bears the same relation to the ordinary
species that Beethoven does to a hand organ ; so
with the Royal and Cri. both closed, the Dacres
at Her Majesty’,s are the sole representatives of
the drama now in the city.
* * * *
Sydney Grundy’s play, “The New
Woman,” is another addition to theß. and B. list
of marriage-philosophy works. For this reason it
is unlikely to meet with a brisk demand at Melb.
Princess’s. The public, in the bulk, care little for
stories of domestic dissatisfaction founded on any-
thing less solid than ground for a divorce. They
are weary of the woman who leaves her husband
without serious intention of billeting herself upon
somebody else, or who, even when she has the
other fellow in view, hears a voice commanding
her to change her mind. The one live “ marriage
question” play of this fin-de-si&cle is “Mrs.
Tanqueray,” which deals solely with the woes
of a well - matched couple under peculiar cir-
cumstances. Tliere is cause and effect in
“Mrs Tanqueray,” and B. and B. might as
well revive that interesting production for a week
or two. There is more or less cause, but no effect
whatever, in the recent conflicts between soul and
conventionality, theory and fact, inclination and
“duty,” or whatever the trouble may be that
incites stage men and women to talk so much
about love and marriage without making the
world wiser.
* # •
Grundy’s story opens cheerfully and almost
promises to be farcical. Clever artificial types of
new females roam in and out of Cecil Ward’s
bachelor chambers remarking that Woman has
“arrived” and man’s authority is a shattered
phantom of the past. They deny the right of
any bridegroom to reek with infamy unless
his bride reeks with infamy likewise, and
they smoke cigarettes till they have to rush outside
and be sick of society’s shams. But these amusing
reformers fade out of the entertainment after
Cecil gets married, and a tragic new literary
woman tempts the young husband to love her
with his brains in preference to cherishing a base
sensual affection for his wife. The poor little
wife, having overheard some references to her
lack of divine afflatus, runs away to a rural spot
where apples grow on gum-trees and all is peace.
The literary woman’s husband runs after her and
proposes a double-barrelled bigamy, but the
respectable little lady bids him go back
to home and duty, which he does. Anyway
the rejected sinner returns to town, whereupon
Cecil comes slinking round the apple tree with
penitence writ large on his face, and the object of
his sensual love takes him back into favor, on the
pleasant supposition that his soul’s affinity is
about to start cordial relations with the fleshly
partner whom her brain abhors. A comely,
practical, and altogether charming old aunt acts
as kind fairy to the young people, also her brother,
the colonel, is a popular interloper who whispers
“ Courage!” in his nephew’s ear, preparatory
to beating a rapid retreat when he sees a storm
coming.
* # *
Miss Talbot and manager Boucicault are
very happy in the elderly characters aforesaid.
Next to them Miss Noble, as an ordinary-minded
wife, is the most apparent success, although her
performance is merely a suggestion of what a
stronger actress would do with the same brilliant
opportunities. Miss Olliffe and Cecil Ward have
no characters to speak of. Their intellectual
attachment is indefinite, and when last seen to-
gether they are apparently resigning themselves to
some fate which they haven’t begun to think
about. New actor Elwood represents the mundane
husband of the soulful lady in precisely the same
dirgey tones and gloomy manner which he used
for the astronomer in “ The Masqueraders,” and
the cheerfulness of several other artists is too inap-
propriate to be of much service. The strongest
point about “The New Woman ” is its up-to-date
title. ,
* * * *
A couple of blacked comedians of dis-
orderly tendencies are the latest engagement at
Melb. Opera House, and a pair of Girards, long
time absent from their sorrowing admirers, will
make a reappearance with the Rickards Co. on
Monday. At the Oxford they have Harry Shine,
Will Whitburn and a reasonably good 00., who
ought to fill the tail-end of the house fuller than
at present.
“The Fatal Card” finishes at Melb.
Royal on Friday, after which date the despised
Gentle Jim will go into recess, and have time to
brood over the magnanimity of his lawless com-
panions in sharing the fruits of his gory deed. It
is remarked that Bland Holt chips intotheclimax
of this strange story with the news that Gentle
Jim is arrested. No warrant for his capture has
been issued, whereas the police are still hunting
for Walter Baker, so it seems probable that
wily Bland is making the statement on his
own, just to please the gallery. The Bulletin
clings to the opinion that Jem goes his way un-
molested, whilst Baker is hanged on good circum-
stancial evidence for murdering the old man.
That fine, large, horsey spectacle, “ A Million of
Money,” will spread itself over the Royal stage on
Saturday.

Revd. Haskett Smith, the parson with
graphic descriptions and photographic slides of
the Holy Land, is due at Melb. Athenaeum Hall
on Monday next. Admission will be by ticket

Smythe, defender of the faith.

Ada Crossley (writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent) made her first appearance
before a London audience under somewhat de-
pressing circumstances. Her concert was held in
the Queen’s Hall, a huge gazabo of a place, which
must be filled to look anything ; it wasn’t full on
this occasion, though the audience would in any
other hall have seemed large. Miss Crossley
came through the ordeal very well indeed, and
made quite a favorable impression, both by her
manner and her vocal skill. I did not care much
about the selection of her songs. She sang that
dismal thing, Beethoven’s “In questa Tomba,”
very well indeed, followed by “ Air de Sommeil,”
from Arabroise Thomas’s “Psyche.” Then she
sang Schumann’s “ Waldesgespracht,” which is
rather dull, but which was uncommonly well
rendered. In the second part, she gave “Out on
the Rocks” (for what contralto can resist it?),
which was vociferously encored ; and, in response
to loud applause, sang a rather mawkish ballad,
which met with such favor that the audience
wanted to hear it again, but the fair Ada said
No. However, Ada Crossley is not yet a Clara
Butt; and her voice, though fresher, has not quite
the fulness of Miss Helen Rowe’s. Undoubtedly,
the Gippsland girl has a good future before her on
the concert-platform, as her enunciation is quite
perfect, every word being distinctly heard at the
extreme end of the large hall. This, in itself, is a
rare merit. She was very tastefully costumed,
and looked exceedingly pretty —she has much
composure, and her method is of the best. The
one objectionable feature of the occasion was the
presentation of a huge basket of flowers —which
looked too much like bogus business to please
those who really wish the Australian contralto
well. It seems to be felt on all hands that Miss
Crossley made a terrible error in appearing under
Marchesi’s auspices instead of under Santley’s.

Florence Young and May Pollard have
been playing the leading parts with the W. and
M Comic Opera Co. in Adelaide, but the absence
of Nellie Stewart, Vi. Varley, and Ryley from
the co. which appeared last year has sadly affected
the houses. Florence Young has brightened up
her acting, and May Pollard’s limbs are divine,
but—alas for poor little Varley !

Billy Barlow, in his 75th winter, is again buzzing around
the country districts of Victoria with his 40-year old
“ Blue Tail’d Fly.” You could not kill him with a hrick.
Ed. Bulletin,— “The Firm say they did not quarrel with
the late Vi. Varley.” I happen to know that did take
place. After making the big success in “La Cigale,"
which surprised alt Australia, no one will dispute that it
was scant courtesy, on its revival in Meib., that she should
receive from the advts. in the dailies her first intimation
that Nellie Stewart was cast in her place for Marton.—
An Gib.
“ Miss Spong is a young Australian artiste who does
infinite credit to the country of her nativity,” says a
Meib. paper. Miss Hilda must be a very young Austra-
lian, for it’s not more than, nine years since papa Spong
landed here with the B. and B. co.
A Bulletin correspondent:—“John Murray-Williams,
an unassuming Tas. musician, possessed of more than
ordinary talents, died (aged 34) at Hobart Temperance
Hall on the evening of 18th ult. whilst performing at a
benefit entertainment in aid of, a distressed citizen. In
the middle of the playing he staggered from the piano,
fell on the stage in full sight of the audience, and died in
a few moments. Deceased was a genial, kindly spirit,
ever ready to lend himself to any charitable purpose. He
might have attained a better position in Hobart, hut for
his extreme modesty. It would have killed poor Wil-
liams long ago had he khown that be would have to die
in public.”
When Marshall Hall was arranging the first of his very
successful series of Saturday afternoon classical concerts,
he was advised that he would never succeed unless he
secured vice-regal patronage. This he persistently re-
fused to do, and although, as a consequence, Guv’raent
House has just as persistently sheered off the perform-
ances, they have been an unprecedented triumph. In the
same spirit, Mr. Hall never played the National Anthem
at the finish. At first the dazed audience sat still, waiting
for the old signal to go home to tea, and didn't stir until
the orchestra started to go. But it is broken in now, and
the discordant thing is not missed. Apparently Marshall
Hall is giving Melbournites something more than a musi-
cal education.
The Vic. Charity Commission invites Government to
impose an Amusement Tax for the benefit of Victorian

Clifford Hal 16, coming to Australia from India, bad the
bad luck to travel with a case of smallpox, wherefore
quarantine, vaccination and woe. The quarantine threw
all his-concert plans out of gear, and the vaccination
seriously affected Miss Ribbentrop’s health. It is under-
stood that the imposing young lady preferred to be
“took” on one of the limbs which are not her arms,
although a patient in such cases must dispense with
walking exercise for a time if the inflamed extremity is
to have a chance to heal. Arm-poisoning is very much
the less of two evils, but it doesn’t adapt itself to the
requirements of evening dress.
Clifford Hall 6 had several months of tiger-shooting in
India, under the auspices of Miss Ribbentrop’s colossal
papa. Mr. Rhbentrop, being permanent head of the
Forest D epartment of India, can lay his guests on to
beasts of prey as easily as he can offer them any other
sort of refreshment. He just sends an official note into
the jungle, desiring particulars as to the whereabouts of
the nearest tiger or panther family, and then arranges a
pi -nic in the vicinity. After luncheon a mob of pious
Hin ’oos tempt the wild beasts to chase them, whilst the
HalliS of the occasion lets fly. If the new chum sports-
man, perchance, misses his tiger he probably pots a
Hindoo, and so there’s a funeral anyway.
Journalistic johnnies who dodge round after theatrical
“ tips” are supplied, in most cases, with the same sort of
reliable information that sporting johnnies get from hone-
trainers. When actors, or actresses, have a particular
market purpose to accomplish they breathe a Action into
the ears of some irresponsible news-gatherer, by Whom It
is passed into print as a fact “ straight from the stable."
Nine out of ten theatrical rumors are crafty suggestions,
or malicious lies, scattered broadcast for the hungry spar-
rows of the press to pick up and swallow. The sparrow
who comes tapping at a pro.’s window with his little beak
is generally liand-ft d by a morsel of misstatement, and the
bird who comes right in seeking an interview gels about
as much truth as might be expected, soaked in vanity
sauce. It is all swallowed. An interviewer gravely
assures you that his information about Sock and Buskin
is correct, because they told him everything themselves.
A famous professional beauty actress still shows signs
of the punishment received from a wealthy admirer, now
dead. He used to dissemble his love by giving the lady
beans. Money is power. Possessed of sufficient coin a
man may mingle with the crowd outside a photographer’s
shop, enjoy the expressions of admiration for the latest
portraits of the most fashionable Venus, and then stroll
home to black Venus’s eye with impunity.
Every little Australian actress or musio-haU perfbrmer

Howiett-Ross, who recited Kendall’s “In Memoriam ”

teaching natural (as opposed to theatrical) elocution at

Baron Carington has been created an earl
and will henceforth be known (in England) as
Lord Wendover. In Australia he will be known
as Lord Mount Rennie—as the man with the soft
bead and the hard heart who, in defiance Of every
tradition of modern law and despite remonstrances
which no truly civilised man could have disre-
garded, sent to the scaffold four 18-year-old
boys condemned to death after a trial so
brutal that “to find a parallel for it one
must turn,” as Dailey said, “to the darkest
and bloodiest days of Irish history.” The
Bulletin congratulates Charles Robert Baron
Carington on having changed his name. For it is
a name which, after the unholy slaughter of that
January morning, can, even after eight years, be
smelt across twelve thousand miles of sea.
At the opening of the big Sydney annual
sheep-show, it was remarked by President Cox
that to-day, out of the world’s 525,000,000 sheep.
Australasia owns 120,000,000, yielding a total
clip of 675,000,0001 b. of wool, giving, even at the
present abnormal low range of prices, a revenue of
between >£17,000,000 and <£18,000,000 sterling.
Out of the 120,000,000 sheep in Australasia, N.§.
Wales owns 57,C0<).000,,wh05e clip is valued at
slightly over .£8,000,000, sterling. The export of
N.S.\V. wool during the season just dost d
amounts to 332,000,00011)., an increase of nearly
100,000,0001 b. in five years; the gross income
derived from the N.S.W. sheep-farming industry
amounting to >£11,000,000. Hie frozen meat ex-
port from the seven provinces of Australasia last
year amounted to 2,900,000 carcases, valued at
£1, 800,000.
Nay,.parson dear, you sway the soul
And other matters psychic,
*lis Satan tempts you to control
The doctrine of the high kick.
How do you know “ the truth, the way,”
That seems to you Aspasian ?
The stocking’d stripes the girls display?
The charms Herodiasian ?
Say, have you seen it with your eyes—
Your own two eyes so bold ?
Or is it titillant surmise ?
Or merely what you’re told?
Nay, parson dear, don’t dribble so;
Get off your moral shelf;
Take good advice, good man, and go
And see the girls yourself.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to seientistr that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback-the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of tins imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

The Royal Bank of Queensland has got on so
far with its conversion scheme that £150,000 worth of 4
per cent, debentures are announced as having already
been sold in London. They are issued at £lOO, and are
redeemable ten years hence at £lO3, so that the interest
is roughly £4 6s. per cent, instead of the nominal four.
After allowing for expenses the difference between this
and the original 4J will hardly be worth mentioning, and
in the present uncertain state of things the bank which
fixes such a load on its shoulders for ten years is doing a
remarkably foolish thing.

The Insurance and Banking Record draws
attention to a number of weak points in the actuarial
report of the City Mutual Lite Assurance Society of
Sydney, which are calculated to make policy-holders in
that institution think hard. The City Mutual, it points
; out, reckons that the whole of the first year’s premium
On every policy is absorbed by commission and other ex-
penses incurred in obtaining the business. Therefore, if
the policy is not renewed after the first year the
office has taken that year’s risk for absolutely nil,
according to its own calculations. The amount of
interest which it is estimated that the funds will
yield in the future is set down at 4 per cent,
in the case of whole-life policies, while in the case
of endowments it is set down at 4J per cent. net.
If the 4J per cent, is not realised, then the office is likely
to be in an awkward situation. As the gross interest
realised has fallen from £7 6s. 9d. per cent, in ’92 to
£5 9s. 6d. per cent, in ’94, and the net interest, according
to the Record’s estimate, has dropped in the same period
from £6 15s. 6d. to £4 17s. sd. per cent, there seems just
a chance that it may get below the required £4 10s. per
cent, by-and-bye. Anyhow, the A.M.P. Society evidently
thinks so, and is gradually reducing its estimated rate of
interest to £3 10s. per cent. From this standpoint it
would look as if the City Mutual, especially in view of its
high expense rate, was cutting things a good deal too fine
in more ways than one, and taking some rather reckless
chances.

Daring the last ten years about 18 Australasian
fire and marine insurance companies have vanished out
of the business world, and the number of offices in exist-
ence has been reduced one-third. Also, despite the large

local companies has dropped in the same decade by over
£600,000, or a good deal more than a-third. A good many
Of the best among the vanished institutions have been
bought up by English companies. The business ot those
that died a natural death also seems to have drifted to
English companies, and the same insatiable J. Bull
appears to have also made some inroads on the business
of the survivors. Altogether the curse of foreign capital
sticks very closely to this miserable country. The A.N.A.,
as a patriotic Australian institution, might set a good,
though small, example just here by swearing all its mem-
bers to insure their lives and their belongings in local
institutions only, and to keep their accounts-those that
have any—in local banks. Even the smallest kind of
example is worth something.

The following statement, by Mr. Teece, of the

nothing whatever to prevent the biggest vagabond that
walks the earth sticking up a brass plate on a door in
George or Pitt-street, collecting premiums from the
people, putting them in his pocket, and walking away
with them.” Now that we come to think of it, one
tolerably capacious and well known vagabond did do some-
thing very like that. But he didn’t even take the trouble
to walk away. He remained, and remains to this day.

Building society business is a tolerably solemn
thing nowadays, so far as the smaller institutions are con-
cerned. The Argus Permanent B. and I. Society (Melb.)
announces that it has got through its last year with a
loss of £123. The chief results of the year are that the
liability to depositors has been reduced by £l2OO, and the
bank overdraft increased by £l3OO. The Federal Build-
ing Society (Brisbane) has made a profit of £144, and
probably feels good as a consequence. The St. James
Building Society (Melb.)has written off £11,205, and made
a loss for the half-year of. £2lll. United Victoria Per-
manent B. and I. Society (Melb.) reports a profit of £276.

Melb. tea season (’95-6) begins with the arrival

a happy hunting-ground for many needy persons, who
would jauntily saunter in, fill their bags or pockets with
a “sample” from the muster packages—and depart.
Now, the tea-sampling system has been checked, all
brokers’ and merchants’ representatives being required
to sign the sample-book. With the improved method
oven, the loss of “ samples ” to ohe importer recently was
equivalent to 1 per cent. In London tea-trade, for every

The Mount Lyell Mining Go. is having a big
row with itself. The directors recently resolved to raise
£160,000 by the issue of 6 per cent, debentures. In addi-
tion to bearing interest at this decidedly high rate the
debentures were to be redeemable in 1905 at £lO5, which
additional concession makes the interest practically 6J
per cent. And over and above all this, the debenture-
holders were to have the option, at any time up to 30th
June, 1897, of exchanging each £lOO debenture for 34
shares, the shares being thus valued at £2 18s. lOd.
Mount Lyell shares have risen, within a very few weeks,
from £2 to £2 175., and with present prospects it is
possible that they may be worth £lO or more before the
date specified. In that case, the debenture-holders would
certainly take shares in exchange, and the transaction
would be equivalent to redeeming each £lOO debenture
at £340 or over. If shares go down, on the other hand,
the debenture people would stick to their original
security, consisting of a first mortgage over everything
and a big sinkingfund. The Mount Lyell directors there-
fore proposed to pawn ail the shareholders property for
a loan of £150,000 at 6 per cent., said loan to he redeem-
able by the payment of anything from £157,500 up to
(say) £600,000.
The transaction looked like such incredible
foolishness, or worse, that some of trie people in-
terested obtained an Injunction to prevent the issue
of the debentures unless sanctioned by a general
meeting of the Mount Lyell shareholders. The meet-
ing is to be held on 26th July, and the board will
probably be able then to eloquently explain away the
awkward appearance of things. Meanwhile, certain low-
minded shareholders are inquiring whether any of the
directors or their friends or relatives are among the people
who subscribed for the debentures, and, if so, how many
of them were in it, and what number of debentures they
subscribed for; and they invite the board by circular to
make a statutory declaration to the effect that it has no
interest whatever in the matter.
But the latest impression is that the injunc-
tion to restrain the directors will not be carried through.
The point in favor of the directors is that they own half
of the mine among them, and, consequently, saem bound
to have the interests of shareholders at heart.

Broken Hill mining information, as handed
over mine-office counters to the press, is sometimes
minutely explicit, but more often it leans to vagueness.
Block 10, it was reported lately, had sold 2000 tons more
of its hig-dnmp sulphides for shipment abroad at “a
satisfactory figure.” What is “a satisfactory figure,”
anyway, and would its satisfactoriness wither if expos'd
to public view? Shareholders’ interests, it is_ logical to
deduce, would be on the highroad to perdition if this
thing got out. Bat. it does shareholders no harm to know
the number of odd cwt., quarters and pounds in their
weekly batch of concentrates and in the lead contained ;
these particulars are, therefore, handed to the press.
It is a pity, anyway, that the information is
not forthcoming, for shareholders might have compared
the figure with the 15s. per ton at which the big-dump
ore was valued in last balance-sheet. But, of course,
the price must have been both high and satisfactory,
since the ore could have been retained for treatment in
the concentrators 1

The “special commissioner” of the Aoe and
Advertiser, w'ho wrote recently on “the Broken Hill
problem,” wound up by picturing the great things that
could be done with zinc. He showed that the consump-
tion had increased nearly 100,000 tons (roughly, from
280 006 to 380,000 tons) in 10 years, without a fall in
price. But, unhappily for Broken Hill, the European
zinc-production is practically in the hands of about a
dozen firms, who have agreed so well to limit production
that nearly the whole of the world’s increase mentioned
has taken place in America. In brief, from what the Eng-
lish and Continental zinc smelters have done, one cannot
in any way judge what they can do. To get out the zinc
is not half so big a problem as to keep up the price.
♦ * ♦ »
The great sulphide problem boiled down :
Millions of tons of Broken Hill ore consist of sulphide
of lead, sulphide of zinc, quartz and other gangue, all
very closely associated, and all carrying silver. The lead
averages, sav, 28 per cent. ; the zinc, say, 22 per cent. ;
silver, say, 20oz. It cannot be smelted in the ordinary
way because the zinc would go off as vapor and condense
in the flues, and would carry off much silver with it and
would require much fluing ; and it cannot be treated by
distillation for zinc because the lead would destroy too
many of the earthenware vessels. Two methods have
been tried, each with many variations in details-concen-
tration and lixiviation. Dr. Schnabel approved of the
latter (the use of sulphuric or sulphurous acid to solve
out the zinc), and the Ashcroft process is a variation of
that. Zinc is worth in Europe now £l3 a ton ; the world’s
annual supply averages now over 300,000 tons (374,00.3 in
'92). The concentrating method, adopted at Block 14,
Block 10, 1 South, Junction, and British, is, so far, only a
partial success by reason of the exceedingly intimate
association of the lead and zinc, each carrying silver;
therefore, though the sp 'cifio gravity of zinc-blend is 4
and of Rad (galena) 7’5, only about 60 per cent, of the
lead and 50 per cent, of the silver are saved, while as much
as 10 per cent, of zinc is retained, though the object is to
get the line out with the “middlings "or tailings. A
higher percentage of lead in the concentrates can be
Secured, but, so far, only by increasing the quantity of
'slimes; and the slimes are more difficult to handle
generally than the crude ore. The “middlings" and
richer tailings produced by the present processes may
eventually be treated for zinc, though for the present the
European buyers refuse them on account of the compara-
tively high percentage of lead that still remains. But
they often contain from 20 to 30oz. silver per ton, and as
this could be saved it w ill probably be a set-off against the
high percentage of undesirable lead.

A Coolgardie manager to The Bulletin : “I
Inspected the new find in the Londonderry at the 100 ft.
level. The stone is of a deep amber color, carrying fine
and heavy gold right through ; it has also some very
coarse gold, such as Bdwt. pieces. I don’t think anyone
not very intimately acquainted with the first stone raised
from the golden hole would be justified in saying whether
or not the present patch is richer or poorer than that was.
The stone is different altogether. It was first met with
35ft. from the main shaft at the 100 ft. level on the hang-
ing wall in the floor of the drive going south. As they
went through it the gold-chute gradually rose until, when
Bft. through it, it was half up the face and from foot of
hanging wall across a sft. reef. They are now through
the chute and are making a winze on the gold.”

taken haphazard from the first 50 tons brought to the

not, however, a fair test, and the value of the •* tailings "
should bring the crushing up to lOoz. In fact, the
machinery broke down thrice getting through the nine
tons. The ground at Leichhardt is barely scratched as
yet; the gold obtained is first-class—minimum price to •
date being £4 2s. (id. A general exodus has set in from

In a Maoriland mining case the other day it
was proved that certain breaches of the Act had been
committed, the penally for which was the forfeiture of
the lease. The Warden pointed out that the case was
clearly proved, but “in consideration of the fact that the
defendant represented British capital,” he would not for-
feit, but merely impose a small fine. Which practically
amounts to an admission that if the defendant had only
represented local capital the lease would have been for-
feited. Evidently British capital is a lot more important
than the local article, and it is the duty of the law to pro-
tect the British speculator as against the local miner, and
the British capitalist is a superior animal who isn’t
amenable to mere “ colonial ” law.

The celebration in Melbourne on the anni-
versary of the death of Adam Lindsey Gordon
was a dull and dismal function. A crowd of
polite persons with bare necks and white shirts
sat round in chairs, drank coffee, and ate indiges-
tible pastry, while a few absurd folks ranted Gor-
don verses like auctioneers selling second-hand
furniture. Several people, who professed to have
known Gordon, reminisced about him with bold
unveracity, and George Walstab shocked every-
body by telling the story of how Gordon told the
two bushrangers to go to Hades. A more un-
Gordon-like affair could not possibly have been
held.
Professor Thomas Harry Huxley, who
died on 30th June, aged 70, was one of the most
useful men of the century. He subordinated bis
capacity for original scientific research to his
faculty for scientific interpretation ; and his life
was devoted, in his own words, “ to the populari-
sation of science ; to the development and organi-
sation of scientific education ; to the endless series
of battles and skirmishes over evolution ; and
to untiring opposition to that ecclesiastical
spirit, that clericalism, which, in England as
everywhere else, and to whatever denomination it
may belong, is the deadly enemy of science.”
Huxley was a born literary fighter, with a gift of
strong, clear language, which he used with smash-
ing force in his continual controversies. Enquir-
ing minds eagerly absorbed his inspiration; and
the agnostic creed which he professed has been
adopted by thousands of thoughtful persons as
humanity's best and most reasonable attitude
towards problems of the unknown and unknow-
able.

The latest Sydney tragedy, involving the
slaughter of three children by their seemingly-,
crazy father, looks like furnishing another illu-
stration of the fact that the favorite outlet of
religious mania for its pious frenzy and oblique
veneration is murder with much blood-letting.
“ Without the shedding of blood, there is no re-
mission ” is a typical Bible text, figurative of the
crimson dye that saturates the warp and woof of
the Book.

Sydney D.T. re the Redfern child-mur-
ders : “ A crowd of morbid-minded people hung
about the cottage all day,” Not at all the sort of
people, of course, for whom the same scribe caters

—with “fishings,” and “ spurtings,” and “crim-
son stains -ad “ pools of blood.”

The stony path of duty ! How we all
have to trample on our very hearts ! In view of
the more-than-brotherly affection known to sub-
sist between the Judges of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court, how bitter it must have been for Chief
Justice Darley, in his capacity as Acting-
Governor, to have to assent to the release of Dean,
tried so carefully and condemned to death with
such misplaced cocksureness by brother Win-
deyer ! And, considering how sweetly courteous
brother Windoyer aforesaid has ever been to bar-
rister G. H. Reid when they have crossed swords
in court, what unspeakable anguish must have
been experienced by Premier G. H. Reid in
giving effect to the report of the Dean Commis-
sion, bursting up and heaping ignominy on
brother Windeyer’s conclusions!
* # «
The situation of the released George Dean
is a curious study. It can hardly be supposed
that he and his wife will come together again and
live happily ever after; that would be too violent
a stretch of imagination. He has not deserted
his wife, nor has she deserted him in any legal
sense, therefore they cannot be divorced under
th.e desertion clause. There is no evidence of
cruelty, adultery, or habitual drunkenness on
either side, so that a divorce can’t be obtained
under any other heading. Presumably, they will
live apart, and the lady will insist on an allow-
ance from the man whom she so nearly succeeded in
hanging, and_they will go on like that indefinitely.

The case reported in a recent Bulletin of
the lady who said an emphatic “ No ” at the altar
recalls a similar incident in a N.S.W. town two
or three years ago. The happy pair had arrived
at the altar after a five years’ engagement, and
the parson enquired in the usual course if she
would take this man, &c. She replied cordially
that she would not. “Why not?” asked the
flabbergasted preacher. “Because he swore at
mein the churchyard,” said the bride. “I fell
over a stone as we were coming in and he said,
‘ Hold up, damn you !’ If be swears at me now I
suppose he will swear at me all my life, and he
would find it cheaper to buy a dog and kick it
occasionally. Good-day.” And the lady retired
amid a deafening silence, while the bridegroom
went and bit a piece out of the font to relieve
his feelings.

People behind the scenes of police work
know better than anybody the many material
reasons which, apart from principles of abstract
justice, make a Public Defender necessary. At
present “the authorities” diligently suppress
every circumstance that might tell favorably to
the prisoner. A notorious case in point. When
Deeming was being brought from Perth, it was
telegraphed and published in Melbourne papers
that lie had had a series of sham tits. As a matter
of fact the fits were very serious, and attended by
certain infallible but unmentionable symptoms of
epilepsy. Certain newspaper men wished to wire
full particulars, but were in the end persuaded by
officials to forward a sceptical version ; and re-
ference to the reports of the trial will show how
skilfully the delicate ground was skimmed over.
Had Deeming had the aid of Crown defence
officials, this important aspect of his case would
probably have got fuller treatment, which, if only
in the interests of science, it deserved.

A young Australian lady, nob unconnected
with an extremely wealthy Southern landholder,
is known in London as Miss “Gyle in the Bye”—
the reason being that it was with these words she
announced the fact that, on her recent voyage to

of Biscay. There appears to be an excellent
opening for an interpreter in Anglo-Australian
circles in London.
A Melbournite, present in London at a re-

Melbourne press and official circles are at
present bubbling with laughter over the very
funny prelude to Davitt’s visit to Pentridge. Ap-
SOULFUL.
MARY : “ But, mother, if we die and are put in a
hole, I can't see how we get to Heaven.”
HER MOTHER : “ Well, you see, it is only your
body or shell that is put into the grave. When
you die, the part that is YOU —your soul—is
taken out of your body and goes to Heaven.”
SIX-YEAR-OLD (eagerly appreciative): “Oh, yes
mummy dear, I know. I’ve often seen cook
take out the fishes’ souls with a knife!”
plication for the necessary pass was first made by
the pressmen in charge of the business to the
Inspector - General. That haughty individual
promptly refused it. He wasn’t going to have
any “ex-convicts and Irish Fenians” going round
his prisons. Chief Secretary Peacock was then
visited, and not only at once issued the order
required, but at the same time directed Inspector-
General Evans to personally attend and show
Davitt round. Whereupon Mr. Evans, who had
the haziest of ideas as to who the distinguished
Irishman was, thought it about time to brush up
his Hibernian history. So he began by asking the
evening paper reporter what Davitt had been im-
prisoned for? “Oh,” replied the wag, “it was
because he always refused to take off his hat when
the Viand played ‘God Save the Queen.’ ” When
the day arrived, the I.G. met the party at the
prison-gates, and, addressing Davitt, proceeded to
inform him how the “ Vagabond ” on one occasion
went through “ the stockade,” and dropped little
bits of tobacco at every opportunity. He also
hinted that visitors were not allowed to converse
with the prisoners. Davitt received these edify-
ing remarks with quiet annoyance, and then
said : “ I was not in gaol so many years without
understanding what prison discipline is.” After-
wards the evident inspiration of the speech was
explained to him, and he has since been laughing
with the rest.
Mr. Justice Innes considers that in an
action for damages for the death of a child by
accident, a set-off against the parents’ claim
should be the saving to them of the child’s
keep. This is speciously just, but how is the set-
off to be calculated ? And, if calculable, why not
put one microscopic set-off against another ? The
parent who saves a dinner by the death of lost
child often loses the worth of the dinner in the
POINTS OF VIEW.

Moran’s strictures on Protestant missionaries •
“ The priests only visit the islands when they are
made comparatively safe by Protestant mis-
sionaries.” Undoubtedly, the natives are “ full
up ” of Protestant missionaries ere the “ prastes ”
arrive. The priest is wise in coming late, any-
how ; he is so much more toothsome - looking
than the average lank, acidulated Protestant,
missionary, that if he went along with the-
latter he would certainly be picked but and eaten
first. It is when the “pore heathen ”is doubled

“A Protestant missionary a hero ?” cries
Cardinal Moran. “Why, lie has his salary paid

know a Protestant missionary chiefly as a foreigner
who has a fair knowledge of medicine, dispensi s
free physic, and drives his wife but in a pom -
carriage. Now, if St. Paul had delayed his mis-
sion work until he set up a pony-carriage—— ’

A few years ago, before the
N.S.W. rabbit-inspectors were dis-
pensed with, a rabbit-inspector
drove up to a station in the Coola-
budgeree region. Inspector (log.) :
“ How do you do, Mr. Smith ? My
name is Jones. I am the rabbit-
inspector and have come to look
over your run.” Squatter : “ Oh,
how do you do, Mr. Jones ? Glad
to see you; come in. Here, .Tuck
(one of the men), take Mr. Jones’
horses, see that they are well fed,
and have his buggy washed.” The
run was duly inspected, and in
course of a week or two the squatter
got notice from the head of the
Rabbit Branch that the rabbit-
inspector had recommended that he
should put on 20 more rabbiters,
which recommendation would have
to be complied with. In a month’s
time the inspector again visited the
station, drove up to the house, and
found squatter Smith on the veran-
dah. R.I. : “How do you do, Mr.
Smith? My name is Jones —you
don’t seem to remember me. I am
the rabbit-inspector and have come
to inspect the run.” Squatter:
“ Oh, I remember you well.
Do you see that paddock? Well,
that’s my horse paddock and is pri-
vate land. Don’t you go inside
that fence. All outside that fence is
Crown lands, and yon can camp any-
where there you like. You want to
know if I have put on 20 more rab-
biters? You can find out all about
them the best way you can.” And
then squatter Smith turned round

Mrs. Dean, the Maoriland baby-farmer,
under sentence of death, was originally a school-
teacher, and is an accomplished musician. She
was the widow of a doctor when she married
Charles Dean, a wholly illiterate pick-and-shovel
man, and is described as having the appearance
and manners of a refined lady. At the time of
her arrest she had been in the baby-farming busi-
ness for five years. At the trial her pleasant face
and gentle manners made a good impression on
everybody, and if the evidence had not been over-
whelming she would almost certainly have escaped.
She took her sentence with perfect composure,
and departed smiling to die condemned cell.
Mrs. D. seems to have been a pleasant woman
who reluctantly killed infants for a living, because,
the earnings of her poor pick-and-shovel husband
did not suffice for any of the small refinements of
life; and she would probably make as good a wife
for a nice old man with means as any other aver-

Like fireflies’ fairy shimmer—
No star in Heaven above you
With their cold beauty vies.
The whole wide world would love you
If once it saw your eyes.
The whole wide world were well lost
To hold you in my arms,
To watch—aside and slyly—
The rosebud and the lily—
Like trembling flow’rs wind-tossed—
Of your most matchless charms.
The whole wide world were well lost
To hold you in my arms.
The whole wide world is dying
Since you have gone from me.
Set in a frame of fancies
Your loveliness entrances;
But naught is left but sighing
And bitter ecstacy.
The whole wide world is dying
Since you have gone from me.

846 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney,
July 2, 1895.
Mv Dear Moorabinda—
The Working and Factory Girls’ Club ball (the
most purely fashionable Sydney pay-to-gb-in
dance of the year now that the School of In-
dustry ball is only an aristocratic memory) came
off at the Centennial Hall, the other Wednesday,
with much “ society ” success. In one way—if the
main object is to fill a bag—it is sometimes rather
fatal to have too much society, for quantity, not
quality, is the key to financial success. From a
fashionable standpoint, the W. and F.G. Club ball
was highly successful, Acting-Gov. Darley and
three daughters loomed large on the dais, and
though the accoutrements of the acting vice-regal
damsels were not up to bird-of-Paradise pitch,
still the dazzling furniture they had to sit on made
up for any sartorial smudgings about the patron-
ising party, which had a double-barrelled welcome
at the door and again at the dais. The ball
decorations were not overdone, the floor was ex-
excellent, the supper-table, with artistic floral
effects, “ groaned ” in the basement, and the only
thing I really didn’t like was the music, which was
rather flavorless. Even Dr. M'Carthy’s Lyceum
waltz, as scored for the full band, seemed quite a
different thing from its sparkling self in solo form.
Also, the bugbear of these amateur Compositions
is that the bandmaster always drones through the
long “ introduction” as if the poor audience was
loth to lose a quaver of it.
The most delicate-looking dress was worn by
the president—Mrs. Hutton —pale-grey and white,
mingled like a dove’s plumage. It at once sug-
gested that scriptural fowl —only doves don’t wear
diamonds, Mrs. Douglas Mackenzie (hon. sec.)'
wore cream-color brocade with heliotrope sleeves
and violets; Mrs. J. W. Flood spotted blue
brocade, the bodice veiled in black tulle ; Mrs.
Prendergast also wore pale-blue brocade, the skirt
covered with silvery stuff. A pretty girl, in
white satin modishly picked out with straps of
blue and silver, looked the double of the departed
Miss Kate Duff, and a plump matron from ’Ome
most unwisely wore a white toilet with a dollish
trimming of pearls and peacock-blue velvet points,
in which she looked to scale a ton. By the way,
travellers are never tired of scolding Australian
women for the loud way they dress in the street —
but I think they get equal with the soberly-clad
out-door Englishwomen when the two meet in a
ball-room. The belle from ’Ome out for the night
nearly always wears far less clothing up above
than does her Australian adversary, and her even-
ing tenue is frequently far more staring—even
vulgar—than the local article’s.
Not many uniforms lit up the festive scene, and
the sprinkling of dashing militaires in monkey
jackets was not enough to leaven the whole lump.
Talking of uniforms, I believe the committee of
the W. and F.G. olub ball are to be congratulated
on inaugurating a much-needed reform. I hear
they omitted to send great sheaves of compli-
mentary cards to the naval beaux in port—who
didn’t turn up in consequence. The naval man
in his glittering uniform who adds so much
dazzle to the mise-en-scene, always brings his
appetite with him, but contributes just nothing at
all to the cold-blooded balance-sheet, and it is time
ball-committees saw through him. His apologists
say that his pay is so trifling that you cannot
blame him—which looks (in this plutocratic age)
as if the over-trimmed sea-dog has been foisted
into a fashionable niche where he has no business
to be. Is it really possible that, pecuniarily speak-
ing, Captain Corcoran’s position is amongst the
“gods? ”
Much gape-seed grew round the Gaiety girls,
who plunged hot-foot into the dancing about
midnight. Neither Palotta (who gave a guinea to
the decoration fund) nor Maud Hobson turned up,
but Decima Moore (who has been out of the bill
with a severe cold for a week) arrived in cream
brocade with a demure fichu of white chiffon
which enhanced the pretty Puritan air she has
about her, and a gold chain wound twice round
her neck. She was, of course, squired by her only
Hope in faultless evening dress, and proved her-
self to be the best ball-room dancer among the
Gee-Gees. Claire Leighton, Blanche Massey’s
understudy, turned up looking rather like a panto-
mime queen in pink, with a silver waist-fringe
something like a Fijian’s petticoat (only the
nigger wears nothing underneath), the bodice
trimmed with silver in a one-sided way, a pink
Toby ruffle round her throat, and a sprig of pink
heather in her golden hair. Her strongest point
was her bouquet—spoils from the theatre—which
she used like a boxing-glove. Handsome Florence
Lloyd, in a black ball-dress with fuzzy black tulle
sleeves, looked exceedingly nice and just a little
naughty ; and Laura Kearney, in black sack with
big black sleeves, looked like the ghost of a
fashionable woman dipped in ink.
The clever Magpie Club, composed of society
amateurs, has seen fit to change its name. It is
nuw called theldlers —not very original, but much
apter than the Magpie, which used to suggest
that the members were blaok-and-white and with
thievish propensities. The Idlers _ purpose pro-
ducing an up-to-date comedy, “Going it,” early
this month.
I have received a couple of original musical
compositions, neither of which is a waltz, strange
to say. From Melbourne comes the “Lightning”
concert overture, dedicated to Lord Hopetoun by
Mdlle. Alice William?. The overture is a weird
musical ebullition with an odd picture on the
cover in which a full moon and a crescent moon
appear one above the other, while a double dart of
forked lightning bursts out of a clear sky. The
overture itself is peculiar, but easily played, and
would have a greater success, I think, if the com-
poser wrote it all over again as a galop. Miss
Lilian Lawless sends me the “Scotia Schottische,”
dedicated to Lady Duff. The “Scotia” has a
verra Scottish title-page, and is a lively rhythmic
schottische to be played with facility by anybody
who knows a sharp from a flat.
I hear of a very embarrassing episode concern-
ing a professional warbler lately arrived in Sydney.
He had been all the evening engaged in fervently
making love sotto voce to a Hebe in the cafe,
mumbling his amorosities so that the rest of the
youths should not hear, when suddenly, in a
momentary lull, the maiden’s voice rang out loud
and clear: “ I’ve told you I love you, and when
it’s my day out —so what more do you want?”
When the roar of laughter had subsided it was
found that he had fled. After all, men are really
ever so much more bashful than women.
The second of the shilling concerts organised by
that enterprising Sydney photographer, Mr. Eden,
to enable the majority of people to hear the Esty-
Marsh Co., drew a crowd of six thousand to the
Town Hall last Saturday. It looked as if a Mel-
bourne Cup crowd had got jammed under a roof,
and when the applause broke out, as it did after
every singing number, the noise was heroic. It
warmed the artistes to put in their best work
(though one would think a stuffily-dressed mob on
the very platform breathing down the singers’
necks would be far from pleasant), and, from a
managerial point of view, nothing could have been
more successful than the second pop. And, from
an artistic standpoint, too, for when the big
building’is 5.R.0.. the acoustics are splendid, and
the deadly Town Hall echo is sopped up. Alec.
Marsh, the star of the co., turned up in large
voice and with apparently the same scarlet button-
hole as of yore. Rival warblers assert that Mr.
Marsh’s success is due to the belligerent way he
cocks those lurid flowers at the audience, and cer-
tainly if good stage presence is worth anything,
Mr. Toreador Marsh must owe some of his pres-
tige to the way he fills the platform, no matter
how large it is. Mrs. Marsh, in a pair of big
green sleeves and other draperies, Madame En-
riquez, and Mr. Cunninghame, were also received
witli cheers.
Herr Vollmar —who played the ’cello like a true
artist—was not so enthusiastically welcomed.
The fact is that the passionate-sounding ’cello,
with all the pathos and none of the squawkiness
of the violin, is not yet popular in Australia,
where people want to know what it’s all about,
and would like to have words put to the “ Moon-
light Sonata ” so that a fat soprano in tight satin
could help Beethoven out. Widely speaking,
local musical culture cannot possibly rely on its
own soul to unravel the composer’s meaning—and
until some enterprising Philistine publishes the
“ words ” of all the string movements on the pro-
gramme I am afraid the ’cello will have a frosty
time.
“Praise everybody and everything” is the
motto of most singers who come to Australia, and
most of them get through very well on these
lines—all barring a recently-departed short, fat
tenor, who overdid the thing. His flattery was
immense. All the geese were swans, and he
would sit clasping the white hand of some parrot-
voiced songstress for hours in a spirit of reverent
wonder that such a marvel should have no greater
musical record than a huge success at an (admission
free) Band of Hope. Then he would wipe away a
tear, and, perhaps, reverently salute the lady on
the cheeks in an “ I dedieate-thee-to-music” kind
of spirit—after which he would almost formally
engage her for his great concert-season, and
vanish. The number of chortling women who
told their circles, in confidence, that they were to
be the stars of the So-and-so concert eo., and got
the photos, ready in advance, was legion, but not
one debut arose out of the whole thing. The next
anxious foreign tenor who visits these shores is
advised to praise these would-be-vocalists at a safe
distance.
Speaking of the noisy art, I think W, H. Paling
and Co.’s recently-issued musical catalogue is a
distinctly good notion. The catalogue is bound
in dark blue, with flesh-pink lettering, and con-
tains in alphabetical order the names of almost
every musical composition—from “ Sweet Marie ”
to a fugue—that there is on the face of the earth.
There are certainly no lists given of music for the
tom-tom or the early Greek lyre, but, apart from
this oversight, the catalogue is an invaluable
guide to the best tnusio for every sort of voice or
instrument.
Sydney Steamship Companies’ second annual
ball came off at Paddington Town Hall, last
Friday, with much success. The decorations
complimented the occasion. Life-buoys, flags in
profusion from the various steamship companies,
ferns, laurels, with a cosy corner of the cosiest
pattern, and the stage arranged as a drawing-
room, made the hall a scene of beauty generally ;
indeed, the only fault to be found with the
arrangements was that rather too exclusive atten-
tion was paid to the hall. Ball-goers do not live
by dancing alone, and the Paddington hall has a
wealth of nooks which a little carpeting makes
into admirable flirtation corners. These, how-
ever, the decorator had ignored, and people who
wished to “isolate themselves to exchange
thought ” had either to seek the icy balconies or
bawl sweet nothings at one another in the teeth of
the music. A fork-supper was set out cafe
fashion with much floral decoration, and a full
orchestra supplied the excellent music.
Several neat dresses took the flour. A well-cut
pale violet color brocade, with otf-the-shoulder
sleeves and shoulder-straps of violet, was
well 5 worn by a blonde. Another episode was
a white silk with a suspicion of silver
fringe in the diagnosis ; also, a well-cut black
silk tres decollete on a lady with shoulders
a la Isabelle Urquhart—both these were worthy.
One or two damsels had apparently gone to the
rag-bag for inspiration—especially one shingle-
sbaped maiden in black velvet weirdly adorned
with yellow roses. She was almost as unearthly as
the person whoappearson thetheatricalprogramme
as a “guest.” Mr. F. Burgess (U.S.S. Co.) was
hon. sec., and Mr. Harvio-treasurer, while Messrs.
E. A. Desjardins, Harivol, and E. Newman, made
the most attentive hosts you would wish to see.
The next nautical hop will be the historic East
Sydney Rowing Club ball, at West’s rooms, on
19th inst. Mr. P. C. Ternes is hon. sec. this year
to what is always one of the most spirited public
hops of the winter. But the hop of the month
will be the Tempe ball—the oldest and most
popular charity dance of the season, and one
which, for occult reasons, men uiake a point of
attending in great shoals. It is to eventuate in
Sydney Town Hall, on 24th inst., and the tickets
are selling like postage-stamps. By the way, a
Jonah’s-gourd sort of charity ball is to occur next
Wednesday, in Sydney Town Hall. Its object is
the relief of distress, but as the charge for the
Centennial Hall is necessarily high, and the
tickets are only five shillings, I don’t suppose
there will be much over for deserving indigence
after all the bills are paid. People who provoke
cheap charity Rtes generally hire a leas expensive
hall, where so much of the money taken hasn’t to
be paid away in exes. The object of this
spasmodic dance is a deserving one, no doubt —
only, what sized crowd would it have to be to
make the Town Hall pay at five shillings per
caput? Dancing would have to be impossible to
ensure financial success.
The first sacred utterance of Governor ’Ampden
has been cabled out to N.S.W., and I must say it
sounds reassuring—Gov. H. “expects to find the
colonists of N.S.W. as charming as the climate is
delicious!” The new Governor seems to have
got the hanky-panky very fluently already, and I
won’t say “Blessed is he who expects nothing,”
because the Viscount’s tinkling introductory
phrase doesn’t necessarily infer that he expects
anything of the sort. Poor Governor Duff’s first
gloomy remark cabled through was that lie was
going out to Sydney under social disadvantages,
as compared with Lord Jersey and Lord Caring-
ton.” What a difference !
The newspapers have a queer way of putting it
sometimes. In touching on Gov. Hampden’s
qualifications, a Sydney daily remarked : —“ The
new Governor has had Indian but not colonial ex-
perience, except that he has been a director of the
National Mortgage and Agency Co. of Maoriland,
Limited, for 14 years.” Yet 1 have no doubt the
genius who penned that paragraph laughs heartily
when the low comedian says he knows French—
his brother was a French polisher !
Three V.R. damsels ought to make the approach-
ing landing of Gov. Hampden (who expects to run
his flag up early in November) of more than pas-
sing interest to local johnniedom—if these re-
trenched youths can rouse up to take notice of any-
thing except the possibility of skulldragging a
fortune out of the bowels of Coolgardie, which
seems to be their absorbing topic. Even the
Gaiety girls fall flat, in a stage-door sense, and
complain of neglect. In London, America, Mel-
bourne, and Adelaide, the stage-entrance was
blocked with gilded youths, one of whom (in
Adelaide) did the Sir Walter Raleigh act up-to-
date by flinging his top-coat over a muddy cab-
wheel ! In Sydney nobody takes the trouble to
wait to see the Gee-Gees go in or come out —
though I am wrong there. The story goes that a
long, lean female with a Scriptural brooch hovered
about the Lyceum stage-door for hours one even-
ing, evidently bent on telling Maud Hobson that
all flesh is grass, or something of that sort.
Ministers of religion have given the Gaiety girls
the usual valuable advt. by imploring the Christian
public not to go near their wicked show. But how
the ministry come to know so much about it is a
matter that ought to be seriously sifted by their
churchwardens, it seems to me. The attitude of the
city, however, towards the frisky Gee-Gees is
much more hospitable. They have been received
with musical honors and fizz at Sydney Town
Hall, and the clergy’s horrified expostulations
evidently roll off Gog and Magog like water off a
duck’s back. At the same time, I think it reflects
rather frivolously on the Town Hall doges that
they should delight to honor the racketty team
which aims its toe at the ceiling, and leave the
Dacres—high-class artists as they are, without one
visible vulgarity in their well-chosen repertoire—
officially unwelcome.
The last nights of the “Gaiety Girl” showed
that if the G.G. cannot change her spots (if she
has any) she can at least juggle with her draperies.
In one way it rather cheapens a frock to set it
aside too easily—at any rate, you never see it
done with the mo; o expensive improvements on
Mother Eve’s fig-leaves. Maud Hobson, for
example, clings to her Madame Du Yan-ish
toilets button for button as at the premiere, but
Decima Moore altered to a blue erdpon gown over
a blue lining, with a narrow black sash and a hat
with black bows, in the first act. The easy change
suggested that Miss Moore doesn't mind |iow
many she buys of these sorts. Madge Rossell
burst forth in a new yellow silk gown in which
Monkhouse alluded to her as “ Colman,” though
“Coolgardie” would have been more locally up-
to-date—but the marvel of the latter nights of the
Girl was the crisp, just-back-from-the-wash aspect
of the bonnie frocks. No signs of a three-weeks’
run on their hems, though it was very apparent
on the nether edges of the “society girls ” unim-
pressive, neatly-patterned silks,
A seasonable item in a parcel of new goods from
Glen’s (Melb.) is Christahel’s “introduction to
the Art of Singing.” Veteran Christabel (who
is identical with Wickins, of the Vamping Tutor)
teaches most of the principles which Clifford
Halle is just now rubbing into Young Australia
from the platform, therefore anyone who feels
chastened by a Halle lecture will respect Chris-
tabol’s hints and exercises on articulation, voice-
production, breath-taking, and other matters that
gifted amateurs treat with lofty unconcern. Glen’s
latest shilling “ Federal ” book includes “Peace
or War,” from Mozart's “Magic Flute,” “When
Sorrow Sleepeth,” “ The Briar Rose,” and
five reliable old ballads into the bargain.
Fred. Oowen’s “ Where Shadows are Not,” a
graceful song with a pretty refrain, is another of
Glen’s recent publications. “A Prayer,” by
Mascagni, is excellent in Italian, but an English
translation of words doesn’t hitch on to the music.
Among several pieces for pianoforte the “Rick-
shaw Barn Dance” is good enough in its way,
and Theo. Bonheur’s “ Skipping-Rope Dance ” is
much better. Neither of these lively jingles
has the grit of Zelman’s “Gnome Dance,”
a quaint little weird production of the new Italian
school of architecture. Zelman, the shaggy old
captain of the V.R.C. brass band, seems to have
dipped into “Pagliaoci ” for his inspiration.
The Earl of Yarmouth, tiring of skirt-dancing,
has assumed a new pose. A song, words and
music composed by the “Girl,” was sung at
Elton’s benefit in Brisbane by Miss K. Hardy.
It is called “Dear Home Faces,” and twaddles
sweetly about dear mother and the family
generally, and expresses longing to return to the
same. So far as. can be ascertained, nobody in
Australia is trying to keep the Earl away from
’Ome.
Another step towards milliner-made male gar-
ments. The Princeof Wales, at the instigation of
the British Association of Silk Manufacturers,
intends to introduce for evening wear flowered
silk and brocaded vests. Indeed, a well-known
English fashion-paper talks gravely of a revival of
Sheridanesque Styles for fashionable men. *
In ri the rumor lately circulated regarding the
Misses FitzStubbs’ intention of starting a fashion-
; able millinery business in London, although the

as well, perhaps, to say that I have seen a cable,

Messrs. Gollin and. Company, Australian
and New Zealand agents for the popular polisher,
Brooke’s Monkey-brand Soap, have established ail
office in Sydney, where they will conduct business
as general merchants and importers. The firm
has been trading for years past in Adelaide and
Melbourne, and is also largely interested in
Tolley and Co., Limited, Fremantle, W.A.,
whom it will represent in Sydney.*
The first electoral campaign meeting of the
N.S.W. Labor-party in Sydney was mostly riot
and miscellaneous football scrum. About nine-
tenths of the meeting consisted of enthusiastic
supporters, but the other tenth was v full of rum
and devastation, and sometimes as many as four
fights were in progress at once. Altogether it was
a great occasion, and one or two men had no
clothes worth speaking of when It was over. Evi-
dently a healthy interest is being manifested in
Sydney politics just now. ,
Scenes between barrister and Judges in the
Melb. courts grow monotonous. Purves, Q.C., is
the star performer as a rule. The Judge repri-
mands or admonishes Purves. on some point or
other, whereupon the learned counsel betrays
great emotion, and says that the imputation on
his professional character is too, too horrible, and
the Judge, chafing the corner of his eye with a
beautiful cambric handkerchief, suggests an
adjournment of the court until next day, and the
Philistines in the gallery wonder what would lie '
thought of grown-up men who behaved thus in
any less-learned department of life.
“ The tiger weeps !” said Voltaire, when,
with an exposition of tire evils of war, he had set
the King of Prussia a-sniveiling. The Tiger of
the Victorian Bar—blubbering over his wounded
self-importance—will be a joy for ever to thou-
sands the remorseless laceration of whose sensi-
bilities was to him apparently as much a labor of
love as of £ s. d. Prestige re-acts upon itself,
and in the game of bluff especially, nothing sue- |
ceeds like success ; but the most imposing edifice
of bluster, for all that, is never without an insidi-
ous crack of self-conscious weakness, which may
at any moment lay the whole'structure in maudlin
ruin. A bully is a bully, in fact, because he is
“ emotionally unstable ” at bottom. a|
Some St. Alban’s Chronicles.
The highest prices that yearlings bred at St.
Alban’s have brought at auction were: South
Hamilton, 1200 guineas; Petrea, 1550 guineas;
Avernus, 1350 guineas; Lord Randolph, 2300
guineas ; Garcon, 1400 guineas ; Red bourne, 1325
guineas ; Ascot Vale, 1050 guineas ; Pascarel, 1075
guineas ; Pounamon, 1000 guineas. Ail, with the
exception of Pascarel and Red bourne, won races

Eleusis, one of the imported mares at St.
Alban’s, is closely related to some winners of
classic races this year in England. Sir Visto,
winner of the Derby, is by her sire, Barcaldine,
while her granddam is full-sister to the dam of
Wisdom, who sired La Sagesse, winner of the
Oaks, and None the Wiser. The latter was sold
lately, at auction, for 7200 guineas—a great price
for a three-year-old filly, and only once exceeded. I
» # : *
Auraria, the Trenton filly, who won the prin-
cipal weight-for-age races in South Australia, is
out of Aura, who is regarded as one of the most
valuable mares at St. Alban’s. Leslie M‘Donald
had Footstep and Lord Wilton at one time of
their racing career, and never was satisfied till he
had one of the breed in the stud.

Nordenfeldt (deceased) was a son of Onyx, who
was full sister to Robinson Crusoe, one of the
prizes in the St. Alban’s stud. Onyx was a very
indifferent performer, and was purchased by Mr.
Wentworth, of N.S. W., at the break-up of the
celebrated Maribyrnong stud, for 800 guineas. Mr.
Wentworth afterwards sold her to the New
Zealand Stud Co. »
#• £ •
La Tosca, winner of the A. J.O. St. Leger and
Adelaide Birthday Cup, is a daughter of Robinson
Crusoe ; and is what is described as being “on
the small side.” Near Geelong (Vic.) resides a
famous pony trainer who .one day called at St.
Alban’s to ask Leslie Macdonald if he might have
a gallop on the St. Alban’s course. Being
answered in the affirmative, the ponyite arrivedJ
with a good-looking prad. As there was only one
horse, Leslie asked the visitor why he sent him
alone, and was told there was nothing good
to go with him. “Shall I lend you one of our
best?” “ Right!” was the answer. “ Fetch out
the white-faced pony ” —and La Tosca trotted
out. “She’ll be no use,” said the visitor, “but
never mind ; let her go !” The dismay depicted
on the face of the ponyite at the end of that gallop
may be more readily imagined than described.
* * *
Hypatia, the dam of those good performers
Chintz, Cinaron and Boz, is one of the best ex-
amples of the old saying “ blood will tell.” Sim
was sent down for sale as a yearling by the late
Hector Norman Simson, but there was not a hid
for her at auction. A mutual friend persuaded
Matthew Bryant to buy her, us Simson was not
in good circumstances. Bryant turned the mars
out without trying her for racing, and whenever
the aforesaid friend visited the Cairn Curran stud
Bryant did not forget to remind him tiiat “ there
was that d d weed you made me give .£7O for.
At the Cairn Curran sale, James Wilson (then
St. Alban’s) bought her with Boz at her side an'
in foal to Lothair for 50 guineas. Boz won tm*
Caulfield Cup, and wound up a brilliant career <>y
carrying 10st. into second place for the New-
market Handicap. Until 1803 Hypatia had 1,0
foals that lived except the tluee mentioned. lb‘ r
colt, just rising two years, by Trenton, is r , e ’ 1
garded as one of the best ever bred at St. Alban s,
and was specially reserved to form one of the
prizes in the distribution.

Windeyer and Purves are the principal
weeping Australian lawyers. And they are both
crying bitterly just now.
Once more : Why is there not a picture
or bust of Gordon in Melb. Art Gallery? Is he
represented in the Walhalla of any other province?
The recently-ennobbled Mayor Snowden
was, prior to studying for the law, a draper’s
assistant at Buckley and Nunn’s. About that
time Robert Reid adorned a Collins-street mil-
linery establishment.
In The Gra-
phic of April 25
is a notice of a
book cal led "The
Land of Gold, a
Story of Austra-
lian Explora-
tion,” by R.
Thynne— proba-
bly a misprint
for Too Thynne.
He introduces
"an old ex-
plorer,” a mem-
ber of nearly all
the expeditions,
who in addition
to being with
Sturt on the
Murrumbi d gee-
Murray trip, ac-
companied Eyre
on his tramp
around the Great
Bight. Now, as
nearly every
Australian
knows, or ought
to know, Eyre
arrived with no
companion bnt a
black boy. Mr.
Too Thynn e
could even give
Calvert points.
There is a
poor medallion of
Marcus Clarke in
the Victorian
National Gal-
ery. So far, however, Higinbotham is unrecog-
nised.
A son of ex-Premier Dibbs is an engineer
on an ooean-going steamer leaving Sydney, and
much resembles his ex-Republican father in ap-
pearance.
Arthur Palmer, President of Q. Leg.
Council, grows very sere and yellow. His voice
now only carries a few yards, and he has to be
almost carried into the Chamber. The old man’s
devotion to duty and his salary moves his party
almost to tears.
There are now living at
Parkside, near Adelaide, a couple
mined Semple, who were married
at Leith, Scotland, Feb. 7, 1832,
and who arrived in the province
I j the ship Lady Bute, on 21st
June, 1839. The husband was
burn in 1809 and the wife in 1807.
At Mount Barker (S.A.), on
June 20, died John Watts, who
arrived in the Coromandel in
1836, some weeks before Gov.
HindmarJi (who proclaimed the
province). Mr. Watts leaves 100
descendants, and his wife and he
celebrated their diamond v*> dding
just before his death.
The only warlike thing about
artist Yilliers is his fierce, up-
turning mo. As he walks along
the Smellbourne block on Satur-
days, pai .ding femaledom stops
as one woman, gazes longingly at
the ascending proclivities of his
upper-lip hair, and wonders,
woman-like, how he manages the
trick. A 1 ng course of plaster-of-
Paris moulds o’ nights is suggested
as the most likely modus.
“Phormi” : “ I am one
of thousands packed into Christ-
ohnrch (M.L.) Tattersall s listen-
ing to a portly polit cian bellowing
out how much he has ever loved
Christchurch and its people. It is
Hon. Richard Seddon, Premier of
M.L., and my memory reverts to
another scene. Kntnara, 1880 ;it
has been snowing heavily, and
snowballing is being indulged in
by old and young. A milkman
is passing an hotel, and the pro-
prietor, with a well-aimed shot,
knocks his hat off. The milkman
retaliates ; the combatants get
closer and closer, bombarding
each other with vigor. Finally it
is a hand-to-hand encounter, and
they are cramming snow down
each other’s necks. A crowd has
gathered by this time, and the
friendly duel grows very much in
earnest. However, just when the
elated crowd are expecting a
genuine go, the milkman capitu-
lates and the hotel-man retires,
white with snow and red with
triumph. The victor is ‘ Dick
Seddon. I had not seen him for
14 years, but he had not altered
two per cent.”
Squatter George Robertson, of Colac
(Vie.), has just died at the same age and on the
same day and month of the year as his brother
William. The brothers (Victorian natives, but
Cambridge University men) owned some of the
finest land and some of the best-bred stock m
Australia. George Robertson was an enthusiastic
and accomplished cricketer, and at one tune
captained a Victorian 18 which beat W. U.
Grace’s 11 by one innings.
A well-known Melbourne man, who in
four years lost wife, family, and fortune, drowned
his old dog the other day, not having the money
to pay the annual tax.
A magistrate named Mathias Davies heard
the police-court opening of the charges against the
extradited boomster, Jabez Balfour. The long
arm of coincidence again !
Wide Bay (Q.) News has made a sad mix
of the birthdays of Bismarck and Parkes. It
credits the latter with having received 120,000
letters on his natal day, along witli trimmings in
the way of a 20-yards-long sausage, a 2001 b. cheese,
and a wreath for his tomb.
DEMOCRACY AND FINANCE .
BUSHMAN : “I wonder why they wouldn’t cash that cheque at the bank? ”
PUBLICAN : “ 'Cause it’s got a ‘cross ’ and ‘order’ on it.”
BUSHMAN (old soldier): “ Holy smoke! This is getting a beastly democratic
country.”
The late R.C. Bishop Moran, of Dunedin,
spent the last hour of his life watching from the
window of his chamber the funeral procession of
his old sacristan. “I’ll be the next,” he said.
Mary Gaunt (daughter of Judge Gaunt,
Vic., and now Mrs. Lindsay Miller) has just pub-
lished a new novel, “The Moving Finger,” and
has almost finished another Australian romance.
Her publisher has bespoken all her work on satis-
factory terms.

color effects, celebrates his 60th birthday on July 6
(Saturday). Ou the same day his old friend,
drainatio critic Neild, will be 71, though he looks
no more than 55.
David Syme, of the Age, would have been
a Presbyterian parson had not life at a German
university somewhat shattered his belief in the
Westminster Catechism. Thus was some German
professor the cause of Australia’s biggest law-
case, Speight v. Syme.
A much-discussed S.A. millionaire lately
created a sensation on Adelaide block. The old
man had on a much-patched pair of pants, whilst
his daughter, who was with him, was decked in
the latest from Paris. However, like the family
fortunes, the old man’s pants had solid founda-
tions.
When Marcus Clarke’s novel, “For the
Term of His Natural Life,” was first published in
Massina’s Australian Journal, the circulation
of that paper, during its publication, decreased by
over 4000 an issue. The publication of the work
in book-form was a serious source of loss to Massina
at first.
Alexander Sutherland, M.A (Melb.), is
one of the very few Australians who has done well
by his pen—and such a prosaic pen ! In royalties
on his published school histories, geographies, &c.,
which he wrote while headmaster of Carlton Col-
lege, he receives well on towards <£looo per
annum.
Griffith, C.J., is in training for that seat
on the Privy Council. At the opening of Q. Par-
liament “he was in knee-breeches and buckle-
shoes, and carried the regulation three-cornered
black hat of the English Judges.” The Tas-
manian aspirant for a Privy Councillorship is
Chief Justioe Dobson,
J. C. Stewart, once Melbourne’s Mayor,
is appointed its City Solicitor, vice Frank Stephen,
demised. Stewart used to be attorney to the
Presbyterian A-sembly, but gave it up because of
theological scruples as a follower of Pastor Strong.
He was succeeded by Mat Davies, who was as
orthodox as they make ’em.
Cole, of Melb. Arcade book-fame, now
runs “ the biggest bookstall in the world.” Some
30 years ago he ran a much smaller one—in old
Paddy’s market. It is now all electric-light;
then it was all slush-lamps. Cole ascribes his
prosperity to judicious advertising. That’s it.
Fortunes are founded, not on advertising, but on
judiciousness.
Parson “Jack” Goode, of Moonee
Ponds, Vic., whose straightforward and cant-
less style lias made him very popular, was
formerly a policeman. It would do every
prospective clergyman good to do a few
months’ night-duty on the Little Lonsdale-
street or Rocks beat and learn the grim reali-
ties of things in general. Another constable
who may be seen daily in Swanston-street,
Melb., is studying for the Bar.
Howard Willoughby, the Abgus leader-
writer, turns out the most undecipherable
“ copy” on the Melbourne press. One night
lately, wishing to illustrate the decline of local
trade, he wrote that the high tariff found
Melbourne a city of head offices, and left it
a place of branch establishments, just as (ad-
versely) “ Augustus found Rome brick and
left her marble.” As it appeared in print,
uowever, poor o’d Augustus was represented
as having “found Rome brisk and left her
miserable ! ”
Surgeon O’Hara, a mad wag, has in
his house a screen presented by a grateful
Jap. patient, and when the great Raymond
Blathwayt was visiting him one evening, he
admired it very much, and asked where it
had come from. “From the Mikado,” said
the surgeon, who added jokingly—“ I know
him very well.” Blathwayt, like the solemn
Cockney he is, took it quite seriously, and
said; “I’m going to Japan, and would be
glad of an introduction” —which O’Hara,
never suspecting that anybody in the world
could be so dull, took as a joke. But it
wasn’t a joke, fur Blatherwait actually wrote
from Adelaide asking for a letter to the Jap.
Emperor. This was altogether too much for
the sporting sawbones, who at onee sat down
and wrote : “ Dear Mikado, —Allow me to
introduce my friend, Mr. R. Blathwayt. Any
favor conferred on him will be received as
if you were obliging me.—Yours, etc., H.
O’Hara.”
An Oamaru (M.L.) bankrupt was lately
charged with not having kept proper books.
Wnereupon ha proudly turned up one of the
volumes and showed the inscription on the fly-
leaf: “Jacob Loudon, his Cash Book, by the
Help of God.” But the Court refused to be
moved even by this evidence of good faith.
Arthur Otto Sachse, C.E., is the youngest
member of Vic. Legislative Council. It was his
marriage with Frederica Alice Lange which
brought him into the family libel-case, Lange v.
Bage. Miss Lange, by the way, was the only
Melb. imdergrad. who was constantly accom-
panied to her university-classes by a duenna.
Young Quinn, who secured the travelling-
scholarship at Melb. School of Art last year, is
said to be seeing a good deal of life in Paris.
Theo. H insen, who went to thegay city about the
same time as Quinn, and worked with him for a
few months, is not so well known at the frisky
American clubs-there, but already two of his pic-
tures are hung at the Salon.
Bent’s portrait still hangs in Parliament
House, Melbourne, alongside that of Peter Lalor,
and certain of “the authorities” are anxious to
have it removed. The picture of the Brighton Pet
is his own property, but he declines to take it
home. The Bulletin suggests that it be carted
into the cellar, and that the ex-Speaker be charged
storage for the time it remains there.
While Parson Haweis was tickling the ears
of his fashionable congregation at St. Paul’s,
Wellington (M.L.), the other Sunday night, and
causing his hearers to temporarily regard Chris-
tianity as a beautiful theory clothed in pleasant-
ness and melodious phrases, a recent importation
from “ th’ ould dare ” thus served it out at a R.C.
tabernacle. He drew a graphic picture of a lovely
spring morning “ wid de pretty burrds whistlin’
and singin’ in the bushes, when all at wanst yez
hear a moighty pale of thunder and 'lightnin’ and
the storrum rowles around yez in terrible and
furious blackness. ’Tis then yea’ll be afther
thinkin’ av yer God, take it from me.” As a big
smile lit up the face of the congregation he con*
tinued : “ And it isn’t anny manner av usethryin*
to collar salvation widoutan itfort, let me tell yea.
Yea’ll mver win Hivven in a walk-over, Oi'U
promise yez.”
It is an unfortunate thing for Mr. Roger*,
Q. 0., to find himself dissenting from the report
of the other Dean poisoning-case commissioners,
Mr. Rogers, as a practising-barrister of N.S.W,
Supreme Court, and a more than possible candi-
date for a seat on the Bench, got himself into ft
false position when he undertook to, as it were,
sit in judgment on his official superior.
E, W. Hornung, who poses in London M
an Australian writer, is another example of those
“ who travel on the game.” His first work, “ A
Bride from the Bush,” raised a good deal of indig-
nation. He is now to the fore again with “ The
Boss of Taroomba.” All that Hornung knows of
Australia was gained in the twelve months during
which he was tutor on Mossgiel station, N.S. W.
Michael Davitt was much puzzled by the
cablegram he got from Justin M'Carthy : “Need
urgent; elections immediately.” He did not
know whether this meant that the “ need ” of him-
self was “ urgent,” or that money was urgently
required. Knowing the Irish party, he suspected
the latter, and most likely he hit the mark. Any-
how, he is not starting for England for another
month,
“ Curses, like chickens, come home to
roost.” Salomons, Q.C., has just loudly declared
that “fortune-telling ” (and its attendant evils to
young people) was the lesult of non-religious edu-
cation in public schools. Yet, in Sept., "JA,
JUST HIS LUCK.
“ Well, if that ain't mean! Every darned one of
the stories in this paper they gimme to read
is ‘to be continued .’ An' me to he hung
next week!"
‘ Julian E. Salomons, Esq., .£50,” appears in a
list of subscribers to “ The N.S. W. Public School
League for making Primary Education National,
Secular, Compulsory and Free.”
“Dicky” Speight, when Vic. railway
commissioner, was onee asked to sign a voluminous
and lavish expense account for one of his sub ;
ordinates who had been on a Gilliesian official
jaunt in the backhloeks. Pondering a few seconds
at each item in the list, he ticked them off until
he came to “etceteras, £5 55.” Then the pen fell
from the hand of R. Speight with a dull, sickening
blob. “No,” said he, handing the document back,
“ I’m hanged if we’ll stand women.”
The last poem of White Knight Fitzgibbon
(=£lsoo a year) the bard of the Melbourne board of
sewers and stinks, appears in the correspondence
column of the Argus. Says Gibbon ;
To the Editor of the Argus.
Sir, —With oracular faculty blest, Oriel says Crom-a-boo
is a “crest! ” In that he is as perfectly right as in whai
he towards me shows his spile. Is good done by such
prosing and rhymes? Would such e’er find a place in ths
Times? Yet, “Look out, great Times,” once was your
cry, though in days, alas, now long gone by. Better
’twere if you still aimed as high.— E. C. Fitzgibbon.
Poor old Gibbon has written much awful verse,
but he never got down quite so low as this before.
“We are all human, only some are more
human than others.” — Walter Berant,
“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho .Smith opined would prove “a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia ; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe ” or
“ Ballyhooley.” It is just the thing lor an aspir-'
ing comique, pro. or amateur.*
PURVES’ TEAR.
Within a crystal phial lay
The liquid gem. Its lambent beam
Did with an amorous sun-shaft play,
And like a serpent’s eye its gleam
Could fascinate with wile supreme.
A man had caught it from the jaw
Of him who wept, and then with care
Had bottled it, for of the law
The grim deceits and humbug were
All glittering in essence there.

•‘ln Austral Governorships,” we hear,
“Now many vacancies appear.”
Alas ! the vacancies are plain
Whilst yet the Governors remain.
The Westralian Premier has posted a
notice on his door that he cannot see any more
office-seekers, and that the chance of employment
in the Government service is extremely remote.
Premier Kingston states that, because of
what they have done for the producers, there are
no six men in S.A. more cordially hated by the
commercial classes than the members of the pre-
sent Ministry.
The secret of England’s greatness. “ Ten
millions of loan-money was expended in the
Maori war, but that is recouped by the value of
the lands made available for settlement.” —Tkea.
Ward in London
The Vic. Upper House is upheld as an
assurance against hasty legislation. For ten years
the people have maintained a Lower House
pledged to legalise One-man-one-vote. It is not
law yet, and the Council is as fiercely opposed to
the principle as ever. Hasty legislation !
“ Hi never sor such a hunreasoning, hun-
hintelligent, pliant majority has the majority that
supports the Reid Ministry. . . . Ponies hin
’arness. You will hobserve that Hi scrupulously
refrain from using the hoffensive term ‘working
bullocks.’ They har’a very hobedient, pliant set
of gentlemen.”—Parkes.
W.A. Parliament, like Westralia itself, is
mainly composed of John Forrest. A return
shows that during last session the fat knight spoke
no less than 1025 times. The nearest approach to
the Premier s loquacity was that of Mr. George
Leake, a clever lawyer who sits in opposition.
He caught the Speaker’s eye 389 times.
* There are vague rumors abroad that the
N.S.W. Council may throw out the Loan Esti-
mates, in which over £1,000,000 worth of the
year’s ordinary public works expenditure is
charged to loans; and that dreary body is solemnly
warned by the Sydney morning papers that, if it
does so, it will cause a dreadful scarcity of work
through the winter, and reduce hundreds of people
to hunger and misery. The attitude is that, if
the Council doesn’t allow G. Reid to cook the
public accounts by charging his ordinary exs. to
posterity, G. Reid will shut down on providing
work for the poor, and the Council will be respon-
sible for the consequences.
The programme of the
Kingston (S. A.) Government
this session includes a further
reduction of the Governor’s
salary, a consolidation of the
public debt to save interest,
and the is ue of a State
paper currency. So far,
Queensland is the only Aus-
tralasian province which has
attempted the currency ex-
periment, and, for want of a
State Bank, it gets its notes
into circulation in a cum-
bersome and rather unsuc-
cessful fashion through the
private institutions. How
S.A. proposes to get over
the circulation difficulty is
not explained. Probably the
simplest method would be to
print notes to the extent of,
say, a million, and issue
them in payment of salaries
and other liabilities, and re-
ceive them in payment of
taxes. By this process a
good portion of the issue
would be kept in constant
circulation, and would
gradually wear away, as all
paper money dies in the
long run, through fire, flood,
rats, and other causes. By
strictly limiting the quantity
in circulation, and accepting
the State paper in payment
of taxes, it should fie pos-
sible to keep it at par with-
out a gold reserve. And
some day in the dim future,
when many drunken swag-
men had lighted their pipes
with the State notes, and
population bad largely in-
creased, the circulation
would become so visibly re-
stricted as to justify the
issue of another million on
the same basis.
Liberty, organ of the
N.S. W. National A ss, howls
loudly fpr a reduction of
£lOO,OOO to .£210,000 per annum in the Educa-
tion Vote. “Popular education,” said Walpole,
“means revolution.”
Some time last month, so says Fiji Times,
a block of 9356 acres in Baa district, island of
Vanua Leva, was sold for .£3OO, or about 9d. per
acre, for the freehold. Good old Crown colony !
A block of that size is no fleahite in such a limited
territory as Fiji. Things are better managed in
the neighboring Tongan group, where the freehold
is nominally vested in the king and never parted
with by the State.
The N.S. W. Council rejected the Jennings-
Dibbs Ministry’s land-tax in 1886; the Parkes
Cabinet’s land-tax in ’88; the Dibbs Cabinet’s
income-tax in ’93 ; and finally the Reid Govern-
ment’s land and income tax in ’95. Under these
circumstances, the pretence of the Sydney morn-
ing papers that it is the Protectionist party in the
Council which did the latest rejection is a hollow
affair. The Upper House is “agin” land and
income taxes at all times.
Although adult suffrage was granted to
S.A. by, last session’s Parliament, this year must
close ere the other sex can vote, as it is necessary
that the names shall be on the roll fur six months
before the franchise can be exercised. If the
Kingston Govt, is defeated and a dissolution
granted within the next three or four months, the
ladies, therefore, may be practically shut out from
the ballot for another three years.
Under the Dibbs tariff, says Premier Reid,
the wage-earners of N.S. Waffs paid £1,913,000,
and the propertied and professional class only
.£832,000 per annum, total £2,745,000. Under
the new Freetrade and land-tax, the wage-earners
are to pay £1,060,000 and the propertied class
£1,026,000; total £2,086,000. Question : How
are the figures arrived at, and who is to pay the
£659,000 which is unaccounted for?
At the very bursting-point of the N.S.W.
political crisis, the editor of the Australian
Star (which journal was the “ organ ” of the late
Dibbs Government) sat him down and wrote a
non-committal leading-article on “The British
Farmer.” A sign more significant than any other
of the odionsness of the Protectionist party being
compelled to pose before the country as mates
with and champions of the Legislative Council.
Melb. Argus and Age bandy customs
figures valiantly in the tariff issue. The weary
old fallacy that imports and exports added
together constitute the trade of a country is re-
iterated daily. If a Freetrade country exports
£lOO worth of wheat and gets back £lOO worth of
woollens —the transaction swells the customs re-
turns. If in a Protectionist country £lOO worth
of locally-made boots are exchanged for £lOO
worth of locally-made hats—the transaction stays
out of the customs returns. Therefore, Freetrade
is, etc. Q. E.D.
Borrowing is “in the air” in Maoriland.
After years of abstention tbe province has once
more listened to the voice of the financial charmer,
and the success»of its 3 per cent. Joan has roused
a vague inclination for another vigorous Public
Works policy, and another boom. The feeling is
that borrowing is a curse, but that when the curse
can be obtained at so amazingly cheap a rate it is a
pity not to take advantage of the opportunity.
And Seddon, who seems to be only a large,
bounceable opportunist after all, is apparently
lending his capacious ear to the idea.
Premier Reid proposes borrowing £lOO,OOO
to be spent on “clearing land for settlement.”
The cost of clearing is to be charged to thebuyer,
and the money received from him under this head
is to be “ earmarked ” and devoted to liquidating
SUNDAY BEHAVIOUR.
OLD MERCATOR (to little Billy Ducks, just left school, who applies
for situation as office-boy, and produces testimonial from clergy-
man): “We won't want you on Sundays, my good little boy. Have
you a reference from anyone who knows you on week-days?”
the loan. He also promises that £194,000 of his
road and bridge expenditure shall be repaid in 30
years by means of a sinking-fund. As G. H.
Reid is the first Premier who has failed to provide
the money for the payments under existing sink-
ing funds, his promises in this respect are about
as reassuring as Parkes’ lOU.
Smoke Eagle Cigarettes,
The Turner Ministry has so far persisted
in its resolve to enforce payment of the S' lectors’
arrears, despite trie bitter wail of the Fat Men of
both Houses that such a policy would utterly ruin
the “ poor farmer.” A considerable amount has
already been collected, and payments keep coming
in steadily. The result, so far, is to show that
nearly all the selectors in arrear are people who
have sold out to banks, finance companies, and
Fat Men generally. The'aggregate Stunt Person
of Victoria had simply left the properties standing
in the names of the previous holders on the
assumption that the State wouldn’t unduly press
the “poor farmer” for fear of losing his vote.
The real selector seems to have paid up very well
on the whole, and now Fat Man is also beginning
to send in his cheque with many groans, and
means to get level at next election.

According to law, all N.S.W. public works
costing over £20,000 have to be authorised, in the
first place, by the Works Committee. A number
of works costing over £20,000, winch have not yet
been authorised, are, however, included in Reid’s
present Loan Estimates, and are being rushed
through Parliament. This brings them under the
eye of the country in time for the general elec-
tion, and the constituencies where the money is to
be spent will “ feel good ” towards the Ministry
in consequence. If the usual course had been fol-
lowed they couldn’t have been included in the
present estimates, and the constituencies wouldn’t
have had the same reason to vote straight in the
noble cause of the importers. The Works Com-
mittee may, of course, reject them later on, but
the election will be over by that time.
F. : Murray Smith, the undismayed cham-
pion of a discredited cause, is a heroic figure iu
Vic. politics. Mistaken though he is on Aus-
tralia’s fiscal needs, his partners in error, the
Staughtons and Maddens and Carters, appear as
ludicrous pigmies beside him. The senile Argus,
like the common scold it is, now slangs this one
man apparent in Freetrade ranks—for what? For
moving in the Legislative Assembly to give effect
to the alleged platform of the alleged tariff-
reformers. Murray Smith, honest himself, thought
his party organ honest, and moved to give effect
to the Wilson and Mackinnon policy. His motion
became the mock of the House because the Argus
lie that the House was pledged to a 25 per cent,
maximum in tariffs was —a lie. Next day, instead
of repudiating the lie, the Argus repudiated
Murray Smith, who, among free-raiders, is the
one Freetrader found.
Melb. Age and Sydney Telegraph are
throwing huge quantities of shipping statistics at
each other. The Telegraph declared that the
trade of Victoria was dead, and that Sydney had
become the great shipping port of Australia. The
Age replied by pointing out that the inward ton-
nage at Sydney had risen in ten years from
1.608.000 to 1,959,000 tons, while that at Mel-
bourne had risen in the same period from
1.513.000 to 2,038,000 tons, and thus showed not
only a larger total, but a larger and steadier
increase. The Telegraph then pointed out that
500.000 of the Melb. figures were practically bogus;
tbe mail steamers were reckoned when they called
on their way from England to Sydney, and again
when they called en route from Sydney to Eng-
land, while, as they made only one call at Sydney,
they were reckoned at that port only once. There-
fore, it deducted the 500,000 tons, and showed that
Sydney was ahead. Then the Age responded by
declaring that at Sydney vessels were reckoned
whe,n they arrived from over-sea, and when they
came back from coaling at Newcastle they were
counted a second time, and that 540,000 tons of
Sydney’s record was bogus in consequence. The
Telegraph blankly denies this, and that is as far
as the fight has got just now.
In Maoriland all Crown witnesses are paid
by the Treasury, therefore everybody who knows
anything against the accused, and many people
who know nothing at all, come forward to testify.
Witnesses for the defence are not paid at all,
therefore even the people who have evidence to
give on the prisoner’s behalf often fail to come
forward. Recently a man was accused, by a girl
of shady repute, of criminal assault, the alleged
offence having been committed in a distant town.
The Crown brought its evidence along, but six
witnesses, who could prove a conclusive alibi, re-
fused to appear unless their travelling ex.’s were
forthcoming, and the aceuse.il was absolutely
stone-broke. He was just getting along favorably
towards a long term of penal servitude when a
kindly bloated capitalist put up money enough to
meet the emergency, and an acquittal resulted.
If it hadn’t been for the capitalist he would
have been convicted, probably with a full know-
ledge of the circumstances on the part of the
“Crown” aforesaid. Wanted, a Public De-
fender.
Steff Cassander : “ Talk about the Chinese
living cheaply and doing no good for a place.
You should see the Calcutta Indians in Fiji. The
coolies, after they have served their time, do not,
as a rule, return home, but go in for vegetables,
Chinese fashion. Tin y grow all the vegetables
at Levuka and Suva, and are among the milkmen
of the place. What would keep a Chinaman a
month would keep a coolie a year. Never coold
more wretched specimens of humanity be sees
than in these two Fijian towns.”
Letter received by a S.A, legislator from

Offer absolutely declined.
The Ministers’ Union (Q.) has decided too
recommend the various pastors to bring the
question of the lax enforcement of the Sunday-
closing laws before their congregations. A year or
two spent in the godless North, among the bearded
mining Sabbath-breakers, turns the hair of the
average sky-pilot prematurely grey—or the con-
science.
H. : “ Radicalism has everything to gain
by the substitution of a Tory Cabinet, in Eng-
land, at this juncture. A Liberal Ministry is in-
variably a delusion, because it has such excellent
pretences for showing how not to do it, whereas a
Tory one has to under-bid its rivals. As witness
Disraeli, who, as far back as 1859, advised the
slash he accomplished in ISG7, but which, mean-
while, Palmerston, Gladstone & Co. staved off.”
In a case of alleged larceny heard at the
current Sydney Quarter Sessions before Judge
Docker, the jury was locked up Wednesday
night, Thursday night, Friday night, and from
Saturday till Monday. Now, had this been a
gallows case before a gallows Judge, the hearing
would probably have been Mount-Rennied, in
order, if you please, that the jury should not be
locked up over the Sunday. That, by the way.
was one of the coercive arguments judicially used
in the case of George Dean. But, in a simple
case of larceny, where no human neck is demanded,
the tender feelings of Justice are not concerned as
to the comfort or inconvenience of the jury.
With the beginning of the really cold
weather in Melbourne it is strange to see the lead-
ing drapery houses sacrificing their winter goods
to make room for an early show of Spring fashions.
Such is the case, however ; and it is marvellous
th is winter to note the extreme manner in which
the prices of articles which one would have
thought would just be in the greatest demand—
such as furs, sealskin j.-* ke s, winter mantles,
dress stuffs. &c. —are reduced at Messrs. Hicks,
Atkinson & Sons’establishment in Collins-street,
during their existing stock-taking sale.

Should Vic. Tote Bill pass in its present form
some of the proprietary clubs will .likely go under, a
clause providing that they shall be debarred from using
the machine. The tote, when in full swing under legal
sanction, will cause the raising of stakes all round, and
meetings of clubs outside the pale will be scarcely re-
garded as even bread-and-butter fixtures should they

If Dreamland has progressed in the way he
should go since Nov. last, that handsome son of Trenton
and half-brother to Mentor is a likely winner of Melh.
Cup Dreamland has fine breeding, fine appearance and
courage, and a fine two-year-old performance on his side.
There is a solid excuse for his failures of last season. The
horse was knocked out in the early spring by a Ijad
attack of strangles, and would have got a long rest if his
rapid recovery hadn’t tempted Scobie to make a desperate
effort to win the Derby with him, after all. The handi-
capper has weighted Dieamland on his form— 121 b. below
Harvester—and his chance for the Cup is good, if he s
thoroughly himself again. In the meantime it would be
quite good enough to bet even money against any parti-
cular horse starting for any particular race four months
hence. .

Joe Thompson has had 1000 tickets for St.
Alban’s lottery sent him, and under English law is liable
to prosecution if he sells them. So, as Joe doesn t see
the force of giving them away to his pals, it is likely he
will s°nd them back to Brisbane again. “ You may
swindle the public over a bogus mine, but it is not legal
to run a thoroughly honorable lottery in England.”

The V.R.O Grand National meeting will be
commenced to-day (Saturday) at Fleming ton and con-
cluded n»xt Saturday. July 13. Much betting has already
taken place over the two big events in which large fields
are expected. Bisohoff, trained by Scobie, at Ballarat,
has been hacked for genuine money and should make a
bold bid for victory in the National Hurdles; Bill and
Kapo will perhaps be found his most dangarous oppo-
nents. ...
NSW. will be very well represented by High-
born IL in the Grand National Steeplechase, and here
again Ballarat may tie to the fore with Medicine, as the
time for its operation is now supposed to have come.
Maie or Dallv should account for the two-year-old handi-
cap, whilst the old N.S.W. cast-off, King Orry, who won
not long since in S. A., looks very well for the Winter
Handicap. # *
“Meston,” the member of Sydney Tattersall’s
who was considered a cert, for the billiard tournament,
and was b. ked to win thousands, went down before
. bookmaker Kurts last week. “Meston’s” downfall was
not so much due to Kurts’ superior play as to the fact that
he was badgered and chivvied “ off hishead ” by a section
of the leather-lunged who thronged fie room. Coming
on top of the Pearl Powder-Merry (I rl scandal, it has
rather disgusted manv of the private members, who,
now recognising that you can’t touch pitch without being
defiled, talk resignation.
And by the way, the books at one time decided
not to pay out over “ Meston, as they 7 considered him
“ rung in,” but they were evidently only waiting to see
how he fared for a round or two before showing their
hand Under these circumstances, Meston and his
backers have a good case for not paying up. It is a rule
of wagering that it is no bet if there is no possibility of a
win. And if Meston hai won, some of his backers had
“ Buckley’s show ” of a settlement.
The ambition of the wealthy Mr. S. H. Gollan
to ride a horse of his own as an amateur and win a big
steeple has at last been achieved at Hawke’s Bay (M.L.),
where he bested a good field over 34 miles on the cham-
pion. Norton. Next year Norton will be nominated for
Liverpool (Eng.) Grand National, in which his owner
hopes to ride him. , * *
The automatic poker-hand machine at Melb,
Stock Exchange Club is well-nigh worn out, seemingly.
It has got into the way of absorbing a threepenny-bit
every now and then, without throwing up a poker hand
in return and the bar-tender (the machine stands beside
the bar-counter) is quite accustomed to being asked for
another coin in place of the one which missed fire. No
machine can be expected to swallow “ thnpmes and
vomit five cards all day long until the crack of doom.
The strain upon the Stock Ex. Club machine has been
something awful. It takes as much as £3O a day down
the slot-2400 droppings of the coin and lightning changes
of the cards: 240 per hour for 10 hours-4 every minute.
No wonder the poor works want greasing. Even
if it plays fair as far as the cards are concerned the
machine doesn’t lay fair odds. A pair of pictures entitles
the lucky investor to one cigar, and a straight-flush wins
fifty or seventy-five cigars, say the latter. Seventy-five
sixpenny cigars to a thripny-bit-150 to 1 against picking
up a straight-flush. Thus far, the machine has produced
one s.-f. from about a quarter-of-a-raillion attempts.

A co. in which the Rothschilds are interested
has taken up the patent pneumatic billiard cushion, in-
vented by one Ives. The new cushion seems bound to
supplant the best of those now in use. Cold or heat makes
no difference in its condition ; it is absolutely true, can
be tightened up or relaxed—made fast or slow with-
out trouble ;it is cheaper than other cushions, and will
last four times as long, if not for ever. All this on the
testimony of John Roberts, who has sampled hundreds of
hew billiard inventions in his time, and almost invariably
found them not worth mentioning. The champion swears
by the pneumatic cush. It has another virtue, which
ought to recommend it strongly to unskilful performers.
The edge of the cush. is Jin. lower than the lowest manu-
factured hitherto, and the rail is Jin. lower. You get a
Clear half of the ball above the cushion when tucked

Woodcock, the Leicestershire bowler (writes
Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent), is faster than
Richardson, though only a little fellow. On ms day he is
almost unplayable, and he and Ppugher will bring the
hunting county well to the front this season. All jour
late visitors seem to be getting into good form and are a
great draw wherever they play. Lockwood appears to
have been forgiven his sins.

Raniitsinji, the dusky cricketer who played for
Cambridge against the last Australian Eleven, seems to
have succeeded his father, or something of that sort. We
read of Prince Ranjitsinji “giving the field a great leather

“ his Highness missed a tempting one and was clean-
bowled.” . .

Stoddart is anxious to see an Australian eleven
visit England in ’96. piloted by Ben Wardill or Phil Sheri-
dan, and captained by Geo. Oiffen, and has written Oiffen
to that end-suggesting that the team’s arrangements in
England be left to the Middlesex C.O. At the banquet
given him by the Hampstead Club recently, Sloddart
said he would like to pilot another team to Australia in
’97 if his private affairs so allowed.

Melb. cricket opinion favors the selection of the
level-headed Blackham (although in his cricket decline)
as captain of the next Australian eleven, instead of the at

The Sydney and country footballers of N.S.W.
met on Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday. The
country men were picked from the New England, the
Northern, and the Western Unions, and the way they
played in combination shows that they study football as
a science. Abbott, the best three-quarter back on the
Sydney side, lacked his usual vim. Whiteside, too, of
whom much was expected, fumbled like a raw schoolboy
at times. But, though one or two individual men were
thus disappointing, several of the Sydney forwards, and
Wickham and Galloway played in best form. Wickham
got a try after a remarkably clever run right through the
opposite side, and Lane, after getting one try would
have got another but that his boiler burst within ten
yards of the goal-line and he couldn’t foot it fast enough
to outrun the opposing back. The game was up and
down, down and up, until the whistle went, and the
Sydney men, by individual merit and good luck, came off
victors by 14 points to 11.

John Gillespie and Co. v of Bathurst-st ,
Sydney, oriental merchants and manufacturers ;
importers of rice, spice, coffee ; oat and barley
millers, began their Australian career many years
ago with an excellent name and an excellent pur-
pose. That name, backed by ability and honest
enterprise, has pushed this extensive concern into
the van of prosperity. Other businesses have
fallen before the depression, but this well-managed
institution still progresses. If N.S.W. could be
proportionately prosperous a new era would begin
with the happiness of a nation.
Imitation is the sincerest flattery. The
best tilings are generally copied. Messrs. Staer-
ker and Fischer, proprietors of the renowned Ster-
ling Stainless hosiery, with the diamond brand,
have been granted an interim injunction restrain-
ing Messrs. L. Stevenson and Sons Ltd,, of Melb.,
from infringing their trade marks, or colorably
imitating them. This is not the first action which
has had to be taken in the same connection.
Owing to the superior quality and dye of the Ster-
ling Stainless hosiery the temptation to trades-
men and importers to copy the celebrated brand
is very great, and the proprietors have frequently
to act on the defensive. A “ public notice ” ad-
dressed to warehousemen, dealers, and the public
generally, in connection with this latest trouble,
appears in another portion of this issue.
The photograph of R. W. Lewis, Austra-
lian mile and 25 mile cycling champion, which
appeared in last week’s Bulletin, was supplic
by Messrs. Freeman and Co., the well-known
Sydney photographers.
Those who are troubled with coughs,
colds, bronchitis, asthma and similar complaints
will be glad to hear that a new remedy, Anti
koffyn, is now available. It consists of pastilles
which are burnt in the Antikoffyn inhaler, the
fumes being drawn into the nose or mouth, iln
new remedy is cheap, simple, according t<

Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of tiie Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from

These Bit lers I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buch i on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of ( lie Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration. ,

The Dean Case.
What is known throughout Australasia as
“the Dean case” came to an apparent ending
on June 28, when George Dean, convicted at
Sydney on April 6 of attempted wife murder,
and awarded sentence of death—afterwards
commuted to penal life-servitude—was released
from prison. No criminal trial has so agitated
this continent since Frederick Bailey Deeming,
the Rainhill and Windsor murderer, was
arraigned and executed at Melbourne in 1892.
* • •
George Dean, the central figure in the pro-
ceedings, is 27 years old, and is employed as
master of a ferry-steamer plying between
Sydney and the marine suburb of North Shore.
Kis appearance and character are singularly
manly and prepossessing. On several occasions
he has saved others’ lives at the risk of his own.
The unanimous testimony of employers, friends,
and acquaintances declares that he is the last
person in the world to commit the crime with
which he was charged. The police, prompted
to an unusually searching scrutiny of his past,
could only say that when a boy' of 13 he had
been (illegally) convicted by a country bench of
magistrates of using, without the owner’s per-
mission, a horse which he rode to the races in
company with another boy, and that he had
been sent to gaol for three months because
unable to pay the £5 fine imposed. This,
indeed, shows how brutality and ignorance
combine to manufacture criminals ; but it can-
not be held to stain a career which from then
till now seems to have been a model of indus-
trious integrity.
* * *
Contrasted with the character of George
Dean, that of at least one of his accusers stands
in keenest opposition. Caroline Seymour, alias
Gaynor, alias M‘Ewan, alias Asbury, alias (?)
-the mother of Mrs. Dean—is a ripe and
sinister fruit of the infamous British convict
system. At 63 years of age she suggests one
who might have taken part in the awful incan-
tation of “secret, black, and midnight hags ”
which lured Macbeth to his doom. The mind
pictures just such another dancing in the grim
cave while the weird sisters
Round about the cauldron go ;
In the poison’d entrails throw.
Originally transported from England to Tas-
mania; an almost lifelong thief or consort of
thieves, with a number of convictions tallied
against her, while behind the veil of that infernal
past creep shadows of malignant things dimly
guessed and hinted at ; Caroline Asbury—
once, perchance, more sinned against than
sinning—-steps into the light of publicity cast
by the Dean case a woman bold, vengeful, and
cunning; an adept in all the intricacies of
crime; a creature with as little sense of moral
responsibility as an adder.
• # #
To this woman, on May 16, 1874, at Mel-
bourne, was born an illegitimate female child—
registered as Caroline Gaynor, afterwards
known as May or Mary Seymour, now Mary
Dean. In the N.S. V\. country township of
Narrandera, 150 miles away, George Dean was
then a little boy of six. And the streams of
circumstance, bearing two dawning lives into
all but fatal conjunction, were steadily con-
verging.
• • •
Caroline Gaynor’s father, Denis Gaynor, a
frequently-convicted thief and a criminal- of
the worst reputation, was in gaol when his
daughter was born. The child was two years
and nine months old when her mother, Caroline
Asbury, was sent to prison for 12 months for
shop-lifting. Soon after her release, Mrs.
Asbury came to Sydney, where she was
known to the police ns a thief and har-
bourer of thieves. Thus the future Mrs.
Dean’s parentage and earliest associations con-
nected her with the lowest strata of crime ; and
when charges of crime became recently linked
with her name the past was remembered against
her. “Do men gather grapes of thorns?” it
was asked, “or figs of thistles?”
• • *
In 1881, when her child was seven years old,
Caroline Asbury seems to have made an effort
to loosen old criminal ties. Between mother
and daughter there has always existed a close
affection, honorable to both ;‘and it is reasonable
to suppose that Mrs. Asbury wished to give her
girl a chance of growing up to a purer life than
she herself had led. Taking the name of Mrs.
Seymour, she set up a greengrocer’s business,
which was carried on continuously till about
the end of 1893. She did not, however, relin-
quish old friendships. Victorian criminals
coming to Sydney made her home their
rendezvous. Women of immoral character
lodged there ; and Mrs. Seymour took part in
the management of an adjacent house of ill-
fame.
* • •
Tothis house Mrs. Dean swearsshe never went.
Several witnesses swear she went there more or
less frequently; and there is some evidence that
she was acquainted with immoral women, and
visited other immoral houses. Giving all due
weight to the statements on both sides, it is
abundantly clear that, considered as influencing
the formation of character, the later immoral
environment in which Mrs. Dean grew to
womanhood was almost as degrading as her
earlier criminal environment and her unfortu-
nate criminal parentage.
* * *
Mrs. Seymour’s house, in the middle of
1893, came George Dean, who had met Mary
Seymour at a picnic. His father, an ex-police-
constable, had died in his boyhood, leaving his
mother with six young children to provide fdr.
George, the eldest, after, working some time
with a blacksmith, came to Sydney, where he was
at first assistant to a butcher, then deck-hand
and subsequently master of a ferry-boat. Mary
Seymour was good-looking and attractive, and
Dean fell in love with her at once. Nothing
occurred to rouse his suspicions as to the
character and antecedents of herself or her
mother, and after an eight months’courtship be
married her on March 9, 1894. A child was
born on Dec. 26, 1894. Mrs. Dean states that
she was unkindly treated by her husband after
a month of married life, and her mother corro-
borates this. Dean denies it, and alleges that'
the only misunderstandings were caused by
Mrs. Seymour, who came to live with them, but
whom he presently ordered out of his home.
Independent witnesses state that Dean was
uniformly kind to wife and child. There is no
doubt that after some months Dean and his wife
lived unhappily together ; and that his antagon-
ism to Mrs. Seymour was keenly resented by
herself and her daughter.
* * *
The gathering storm burst on March 14 last,
when Dean was arrested and charged at North
Shore police-court with administering poison to
his wife with intent to murder her. He was on
23rd March committed for trial by the stipen-
diary magistrate, who, though he expressed
grave doubts as to the good faith of the
evidence against accused, could not himself
take the responsibility of dismissing the
case. The trial commenced at the Cen-
tral Criminal Court, Sydney, on Thursday,
April 4, before Judge Windeyer and a jury of
twelve. It ended late on Saturday night, 6th
April, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty,
with a strong recommendation to mercy on
account of Dean’s previous good character ; and
the Judge passed sentence of death. This was
commuted by the Executive Council to penal
servitude for life.
* * *
The trial presented many remarkable features,
of which three in particular are noteworthy.
r l he first was the grotesque assumption by
prosecuting counsel —to some extent supported
by medical evidence, and acquiesced in by
defending counsel, Judge, and jury that
strychnine and arsenic are mutually antidotal.
Mrs. Seymour and Mrs. Dean swore that Dean
administered to the latter various articles of
food and drink which made her purge and
vomit; the doctor attending Mrs. Dean testified
that her symptoms agreed with those to be
expected after strychnine and arsenic had been
taken in certain quantities ; and analysis of
liquors said to have been partaken of by Mrs.
Dean, and of fluids and solids alleged to have
passed through her body, showed that these
contained arsenic or strychnine, or both to-
gether, in more or less poisonous quantities.
8o much arsenic, and so much strychnine, were
found, that it became a question how Mrs.
Dean could have swallowed the quantity she
wasalleged to have swallowed and survived; and
in order to remove any doubt, prosecuting coun-
sel stated that “ fortunately, with the arsenic an
antidote in the shape of strychnine had been
administered, and although a sufficient quan-
tity of the former poison had been found in the
medicine to kill several persons, fatal results
did not ensue.” r lhe verdict of the jury was
doubtless influenced by this false assumption,
which is justified by no evidence known to
medical science. It is possibly true that the
stimulant effect of strychnine may to some
extent counteract the generally deadening in-
fluence of arsenic on the heart’s action ; hut
that the counteraction has antidotal value where
poisonous doses have been taken is an assertion
a priori improbable and unsupported by a single
shred of proof.
• # #
The second remarkable feature of the /rial
was that the jury’s verdict appeared to very
many unbiassed persons to be quite against the
weight of evidence. Allowing for the anti-
dote fallacy, allowing for the circumstance
that the characters and history of Mrs. Dean
and Mrs. Seymour were imperfectly made
known to the jury, and passing the points
that Dean was not shown to have obtained or
possessed poison, and that he was an extremely
unlikely person to commit such a crime ; there-
remained the curious fact that the jury lingered
in indecision until Dean entered the witness-
box and gave the only evidence which under
the circumstances an innocent man possibly
could give, the very evidence which under the
circumstances a guilty man certainly would not
give, and then made up their minds that he was
guilty. So many people received a contrary
impression, that it appeared a fair inference that
either the jurymen or a majority of the public
were incapable of comprehending the value of
evidence.
* *
The third and most remarkable feature of the
trial was the conduct of the presiding Judge.
He deprecated what he termed the attempt to
blacken (!) Mrs. Seymour’s character, and
summed up strongly against the prisoner. The
jury retired at 12.25 p.m., and as at 8.35
p.m., according to the newspaper reports, they
had not agreed upon a verdict, the Judge
recalled them and said that “the issues were
so clear in the case ... that it was almost
a scandal upon the administration of justice
that they could not come to a conclusion.”
Then he pointed out that “unless the jury
agreed upon a verdict, they would have to
remain incarcerated in their room until Monday
morning, as the law did not permit him to do
anything else.” The significance of this in-
decent hint to hasten—indecent, seeing that a
man’s life was at issue—was not missed by the
jury, who apparently took it as a menace of
60 hours’ imprisonment ; and in about seven
minutes they returned with their verdict.
Then the Judge (who had hinted to the jury
that it would he open to them to recom-
mend the prisoner to mercy while finding him
guilty) in passing sentence, used this extra-
ordinary language to the prisoner : “ I am as
satisfied that you poisoned that woman, your
wife —not once, or twice, hut on every occasion
that she fell sick—l am as satisfied of it as if I
had seen you put the poison in her food.” Con-
sidering the circumstances, considering the evi-
dence, warrant for this statement will in vain
be looked for. (The Judge’s notes, hy-the-way,
omit all mention of the fact that he re-
called the jury to express surprise at their
delay in coming to a verdict, and state that
the jury returned at 9.55 p.m.)
# # «
All these things combined to make a deep
impression on the public mind, and an agitation
for the release of Dean was immediately com-
menced. It gathered strength so quickly and
so markedly that on Bth May the Government
yielded to its urgency and appointed a Commis-
sion to investigate the case, and decide whether
Dean should serve his sentence or be released.
The members of the Commission, which sat
at intervals for several weeks, were Mr.
F. E. Rogers (president), Dr. Sydney Jones,
and Dr. F. N. Manning. The appointment of
a lawyer as president was perhaps inevitable ;
yet many doubted whether any practising
lawyer, however able and honorable, could
wholly resist the immense social and legal influ-
ence which was being brought to bear in order to
uphold the conviction, or could come to a per-
fectly unbiassed conclusion. The reputations
of the presiding Judge, of the Attorney-General
and other prosecuting counsel, of the Police
Department—which had carefully gathered the
evidence which told against Dean, and had
strangely omitted to bring forward the evidence
which told in his favor—were more or less at
stake ; and all the forces of officialdom leagued
to keep Dean behind the walls of Darlinghurst
gaol.
* * #
But the Citizens’ Defence Committee—fight-
ing with funds raised by public subscription
against the bottomless purse of the Government
Law Offices ; fighting a bureaucracy supposed to
be impartial, but pricked by the spite of wounded
vanity into venomous party aggression—brought
forward a mass of new evidence which should
have been produced by the prosecution at the
trial, or before the trial ; evidence on which the
foregoing narrative is chiefly based ; evidence
which impelled a majority of the jurymen to
say publicly that, had it been presented to
them, Dean would never have been convicted.
Mrs. Seymour’s character was slipwn to be the
worst possible; Mrs. Dean’s character was
seriously impugned ; and the question for deci-
sion became practically whether their oath or
the oath of George Dean should receive credence.
• * •
The effect of the whole body of evidence left
little doubt as to the verdict of the Commission.
The Commissioners were asked to say whether
George Dean should be released from prison.
It appeared from the enquiry that it would
have been more to the point to ask why he was
ever sent there. Dean was accused of poisoning
his wife ; and his guilt or innocence is possibly
even now a matter of conjecture. But Justice
does not act on conjecture. Justice demands
that, before a man is imprisoned, his guilt
should be proven ; and Dean’s guilt has never
been proven. It was not proven to the jury
which convicted him ; still less was it proven
to the Commission. And as it is legally and
justly held that a man is innocent till he is
proven guilty, for the purposes of the enquiry
Dean was innocent and deserved instant release.
• * *
This conclusion a majority of the Commis-
sioners seem to have had no difficulty in reaching.
They did not need to consider whether Dean is
actually innocent, or whether he could afford
proof, or even reasonable presumption, of his
innocence. That would he too much to expect
of any man. Suppose, for example, that some-
body living under the roof of the legal President
of the Commission—who is understood to have
dissented from the verdict of his colleagues—
took a dose of poison from whim, or malice, or
“ that tired feeling,” or in a crazy fit, and then
turned round and said the President poisoned
her. How would he prove his innocence, sup-
posinghecould not prove her previous possession
of poison ? Her word would be as good as his ;
her innocent baby-face would appeal to an
impressionable mate jury more than his ; and if
he happened to be tried by a clairvoyant Judge
who, in his mind’s eye, saw him brewing a jug-
ful of poison—the President’s neck would be in

Several theories were put forward as being
capable of more or less plausibly fitting
the evidence. It was suggested that Dean
poisoned his wife ; that Mrs. Dean poisoned
herself; that Mrs. Seymour and Mrs. Dean
together administered the poison ; that Mrs.
Seymour administered poison without Mrs.
Dean’s knowledge ; that Mrs. Dean never took
poison at all. But the point was that the Com-
mission was not concerned with the relative
plausibility of these theories ; it had to consider
only whether the first one—that Dean poisoned
his wife—was not only plausible, but proven ;
and the medical members of the Commission,
Dr. Sydney Jones and Dr. Manning, decided
that it was not proven, and recommended the
release of Dean. Mr. Rogers, the legal member
of the Commission, dissented.

The Executive Council endorsed the recom-
mendation of the majority, and on June 28, after
three months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment,
George Dean stepped, a free man, into the air
of Liberty. Compensation for the suffering
unjustly inflicted upon him has still to follow.
The daily press publishes a cable about the
proceedings of the New York . suicide chib. A
great crowd assembled outside the club’s room on
the occasion of the annual pow-wow. No speeches
were made by the clubmen, but lots were drawn
and the doomed man withdrew without emotion.
The message, of course, is “ borak ” on the face of
it, and was evidently sent by the hanging-re-
porter who always writes that the condemned
“ walked to the gallows with a firm step.”
An Official Report.
Re barrister-doctor Todd’s letter to the press
explaining that Dr. Newmarch is not respopsir
ble for the erroneous theory, acted upon at the
Dean trial, that a poisonous dose of strychnine
and a poisonous dose of arsenic would be
mutually antidotal, Judge Windeyer’s notes:
report the witnesses as follows
Dr. Newmarch: Supposing a person took a dose of
arsenic and then took strychnine it would be an antidote
to jt. Arsenic deadens the pulse, but strychnine would .
quicken It. . . . Strychnine would have a bitter:
taste, and supposing she had taken some of it would ac-
count for her having a strong pulse supposing she Had
been suffering from arsenical poisoning. . . , The
taking strychnine would the better enable her to go
about.
Dr. Rennie ; “ I agree with Dr. Newmarch. The symp-
toms described are those of acute arsenical poisoning.
Strychnine, taken with arsenic, will account for the
steady pulse described. Arsenic deadens the heart's
action ; strychnine stimulates it. . . . Her being able
to move about in the afternoon would be accounted for 1
by her taking strychnine with the arsenic.”
After Mr. Meagher’s address :
Mrs. Dean, at the request of juror, then shows how
much syrup she put in the glass.
Hamlet says the quantity is a little over two ounces. . •
The strychnine would modify- the arsenic, to which it i»
antagonistic and would counteract it.
1. Will these witnesses admit that these notpsr
are correct? 2. Whether they admit it or hot,
are the notes correct? The Judge is, in the
eyes of the law, absolutely infallible as a re-
porter, His notes must not, in any circum-
stances, be impeached. You may question the
correctness of his law, but you must not sug-
gest that he made a mistake in his report of the
evidence. The situation as here shown is
indeed an edifying one.
Premier Reid’s Programme.
Premier Reid announced his policy and that
of his Government to a small meeting of Sydney
electors last Monday night. There are some
notably good things in the programme, and
some conspicuously bad ones, and some that
are not distinctly good or bad, but only mixed.
In this respect it is like all other programmes,
and, under the system of Party Government,
the country has to take or reject all these
things, and Mr. Reid also, as well as many other
things and persons not mentioned, in a lump.
G. H. Reid promises to reform the Council by
making it a nominee body of 60 members, of
whom 12 will retire every year, so that the
tenure of office will be only five years. The
proposal is not theoretically perfect by any
means, nor is it distinctly democratic, but it
must inevitably make the Upper House much
more progressive and up-to-date than it now is,
or than it can be under existing conditions, so
The Bulletin cordially approves of the idea
until a better one comes along. The Referendum
is to be introduced in a limited fashion, the
people being made the final court of appeal in
cases where the Council and Assembly are un-
able to agree. This also is the beginning of a
great and urgent reform. The land-tax, with
the same exemptions as already proposed,
is to be persisted in, and the Premier’s
firmness in resisting the demand for an
all-round tax, with no exemptions whatever—a
demand which was put forward under a bogus
pretence of fairness and equality—is commend-
able. New South Wales wants a graduated
land-tax, and a much heavier one than that
which the Council recently rejected—partly for
revenue purposes, and in still greater part to
prevent the ruinous iniquity of big estates
taking root in the country. These are the dis-
tinctly good features of G. H. Reid’s policy.
On the other hand, he does not purpose, so far
as yet appears, to abolish the present unwork*
able system of Party Government, by making
the Ministry an elective body, with a fixed
term of office. He professes a belief in Free-
trade and Federation—in other words, he in-
tends to hasten the union of the six provinces
of Australia by increasing the number of their
differences, and to make agreement easy by de-
parting as widely as possible from the policy of
his neighbors. It is still the cardinal principle
of his creed that local industries should be
sacrificed to the interests of the Sydney import-
ing ring, and that the local white man should
go unemployed in order that the country should
be flooded with the cheap products of the
Asiatic, who works 15 hours per diem, and the
hard-driven serfs of Europe, and the Queens-
land Kanaka, and other human flotsam and
jetsam. Aiso, he gives no promise to reform
his ruinous financial methods, and still retains
the proud pre-eminence of being the worst and
most politically dishonest Treasurer his province
has possessed within the memory of the present
generation. The country has to lump the Govern-
ment policy, and decide whether the land-tax
and the other reforms are, or are not, too dear at
the price. Also, it has to form its own con-
clusions as to whether the feeble Premier, who
has accomplished nothing at all so far, except
the shameless “ cooking” of the public accounts
and the sacrifice of Local Government to the
demands of the Fat Man interest, is capable of
carrying out the programme, and if he really
means to carry it out. And if the country has
doubts on these points, which it probably will
have, the other party will most likely be also
willing to promise Upper House reform and a
land-tax—at a time like the present the average
party will promise anything; and the com-
munity may sit down and try to decide which
of the two is more likely to carry out its pro-
mises, oris best able to carry them out, supposing
either of them really desires to do so. And
may the Lord have mercy on that community’s
soul!

""A recent Vio. sporting swindle. A suburban
racecourse proprietor gets telegrams entering two or
three cr.ck horses for a small handicap. They are
weighted and put on the card, and although they don t
coin" mar the course no one appears to scratch them.
Consequently they are made favorites, anything else
being Borloto 1. Toen the cl -ver ones come in and get
their nion- y on at a good price about their special gee-
gee a horse which, but for the presence of the cracks,
would h - about 6 to 4, and, in fact, is qu >ted at that as
soo ias the gam is discovered. Quite lately a prominent
Melh. owner was fined for not scratching his horses for a
certain event. He objected and denied having entered
the nags, hut was shown a telegram authorising the club
to make the entry.

Among English thoroughbreds a sire, and dam of
the same color will reproduce that coloriu their offspring
586 times out of 1000. Two Arabs of the same color will re-
produce it in the foal 837 times in 1000. A white Arab
mare, mated with a stallion of different color, will have a
while foal 729 limes out of 1000. But, of course, the
number of recorded instances is too small to make this
rati > much more than guesswork.

Mr. W. A. Long has always been both a keen
judge of a horse and a lover of racing, and, when an
undergraduate at Cambridge, devoted a good deal of ins
time to his favorite sport. Naturally he had his penchant
for certain horses, and, if I mistake not (writes The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent), he thought that Asteroid
was the best horse he had ever seen. Asteroid, it will be
remembered, won the Chester Cup under the heavy bur-
den of 9st. 41h., being then a five-year-old. Mr. Long
may, therefore, be pleased to know that Kiisallaghan, the
hero of the Chester Cup of this year, is a grandson of old
Asteroid, being by his son, Astrologer, out of Gipsy, by
the American-bred Brown Prince, a son of Lexington,
whose stock are so highly esteemed in the States. Kii-
sallaghan seemed to be the only horse in the race able to
stay the distance, hut I fancy his success was not quite
expected by either Capt. Machell or the astute Jewitt, or
he would not have started at 20 to X.

Seale’s smoke concert at Sydney Amateur Athletic Club.
The songs alternated wdth three and four-round boxing
matches. Mr. “ Paddy ” Lane (wing forward to Wallaroo)
in shirt sleeves and pipe in mouth, presided ; the tem-
perature was above record, and a dense cloud of smoke
changed one singer into bacon before he had half sung his
song. Several good men boxed, and a finishing bout
between Messrs. Lane and Seale drew from a delighted
American lover of the game the exclamation that Seale is
the sort of man that is seen once only in a lifetime.

Zimmerman’s courtship and marriage was quite
a Young Ladies’ Journal novelette. She came out of the
convent to travel, and, on her return trip on board
steamer, she met the dashing cyclist. It was “ love at
first sight,” and, until they were married, Zimmerman
wrote to her every day. They were married quite unex-
pectedly in April, and Mis. Z. has said already that
“ Arthur is not to race any more.”

W. G. Grace’s wonderful cricket form this
season must surely be the last flare-up of the expiring
candle. Or perhaps they have been bowling just a littl j
bit soft to die W.G.O. M. in order to feed public enthusiasm
re the national testimonial. Anyway, ids record of five
“centuries” within five weeks, 30 years after ins
first appearance in an All-England Eleven, is a wonderful
thing, a feat that no small batsman can hope to rival.
Grace is one of the good big 'uns who are always better
than the good little 'uns in athletic sports, as long as they
take care of the mselves. A fat man, too. The champion
who slowlv fattens on muscular exercise is the stayer.

Giffeu if lie weighed another 211 b.

The suggestion of the N.S.W. Rowing Associa-
tion that the question of Dawson’s amateur status should
he referred to an English tribunal, has mightily amused
Vic. rowing men. It isn’t to be expected that tribunals
which have ruled that a man who measures off a yard of
tape in a shop is not fit to he classed as a bona-fide
amateur, and that to retain amateur status you must
wear sleeves to your jersey, would decide in favor of the
result of the last race remaining unaltered. But, apart
from prejudice, it is hard to see how anyone could fail to
uphold the contention of ttie Sydneyites. Three months
before the race the N.S.W. Association announced in the
press that it objected to t he inclusion of any cash amateur
cyclists. Nevertheless, Victoria placed Dawson in her crew
without special warning to N.S.W. or Queensland. And,
as for the interpretation of the rules, Dawson was in-
eligible, no one who has won an “ open competition (not
an open rowing-competition) for money” being regarded
as an amateur. On the technicalities Victoria should
certainly lose the last inlerprovincial contest ; on the
merits of the case the result should remain as it was,
“ first past, the post.”
Years ago the chief authorities of the Victorian
police were ardent devotees of cock-fighting and dog-
fighting. At West Melbourne l.ek-up there was a cock-
fighting field-day fortnightly, and one of the treats
provided for the Duke of Edinburgh by Chief-Commis-
sioner Standish was an afternoon’s cock-fighting on
premises not very far from the Melbourne Club. When
one of the cocks got over the fence, out went the Duke in
chase of it.

At a recent English cricket-match a professional
nearly run out was so pleased at the umpire’s
favorable decision that he joyousty jumped in the air.
The wicket-keeper, who still held the ball, knocked down
a stump (because the bails were off) while the man was in
the air, and appealed again to the umpire. The profes-
sional was then given “ out.”

Apropos of the shooting-party which has just
gone from Palmerston to tackle the buffaloes on Melville
Island, doesn’t it seem a pity to slaughter the beasts
(estimated at about 20,000) for the sake of hides, which it
is calculated will only net two or three shillings apiece?
Melville Island is right in the track of shipping and could
soon be cleared of buffaloes by a smart party. Surely the
island could easily be proclaimed a preserve under Govt,
supervision.

Soutl
THOS. MUDIMAN, Muster Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
i Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ; Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to >ny business. 1 tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope obtained some of Heir Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “.Alfaline Vitality Pills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COMPLETELY CURED Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The ALFALINE Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.
Subscribed and declared at Sydney this 23rd day of November, 1891, before me.— S. T. WniDDON,
J.P. Also witnessed by A. Baly, E-q., a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales and Victoria.

and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Yours, 11. A. BUCK.HAM.

160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir. —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, I-consider you are deserving of success, wmco
I do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous’ System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had n
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then 1 have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing lo suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

rpKIS Company is being formed for the pur-
I. pose of acquiring and working Mining Leas s
No. 1151 and 1639, containing 25 acres and 18 acre*
respectively or 43 acres in all, and known as tie
Westralia Extended Claim. These leases an
situated about 7 miles North of Coolgardie, ai d
immediately adjoin the Westralia Proprietary
and New Victoria mines.
The workings of the Westralia Proj rietary
Company on a continuation of the New Victoria
reef extend almost to the boundary of the two
leases. From the North end of their ground the
Westralia Proprietary Company have obtained
some wonderfully rich stone. This mine was
recently sold to an English Syndicate for .£15,000
cash and a one-sixth fully-paid-up share, equal in
all to .£32,000, and the New Victoria mine has
during the month been sold to Dr. Simon on
behalf of a French Syndicate for £40,000 cash.
It is the opinion of practical men who know the
locality, that the New Victoria reef will run right
through one or other of the leases.
A small gully which crosses the leases is rich in
alluvial gold, nuggets up to 4£oz. having been
found.
The principal work has been done on lease
1151 on what is known as the Western reef of the
New Victoria mine. This reef has been exposed
for a length of three chains in an open cutting,
and for that distance the lode averages four feet
wide. The reef is a very compact one, well
mineralised and having gold evenly distributed
throughout, and is estimated to average 2oz. per
ton.
At a distance of 60 feet to the East, of the
cutting a main shaft has been sunk to a depth of
85 feet. A drive was put in West 20 feet, and
the reef cut. Since then, the reef has been driven
on North and South, averaging 3 feet 6 inches in
thickness, and carrying gold in equal quantity to
the surface formation. Two other shafts have
been sunk on the reef to the North of the.cutting,
in both of which good gold has been found.
The New Victoria Company has crushed 140
tons from a continuation of this reef (taken from a
point where the reef outcrops on the surface, 12
feet wjde), for a return of 140 oz. 7dwts., which,
taking into account the imperfect crushing appli-
ances, is highly satisfactory.
A cross reef running from the Western reef
carrying coarse gold and averaging about 2 feet in
thickness has been traced for a considerable dis
tance towards the Eastern boundary of lease No
1151, which will be well worth further develop
ment.
On lease No. 1639 a shaft is being sunk to strike
the New Victoria reef, which, as before stated , h as
been worked 3 chains of the South
boundary, and it is expected the lode, will be
struck when a depth of 100 feet is attained.
The promoters have been working these lease
for nearly 12 months, and now offer them to tb
public so that capital may be raised to develop
the mine systematically. e
Mr. Tiros. Fowler, late manager of the New
Victorian mine, reports more favorably on the
property, and as he has a thorough knowledge of
the ground, and is so favorably known both in
Coolgardie and Victoria, his report, which can be
seen at the brokers’ offices, can be thoroughly
relied on. r
There is an abundance of timber for fuel and
general mining purposes, and water is attainable
at a depth of about 150 feet.
Intending investors will note there are no Paid-up
Shares, and that the promoters, in addition to
taking Contributing shares in part payment for the
property, are subscribing for 7000 additional
Shares on the same terms as the balance of 13,000
Shares are offered to the public, thus practically
showing their confidence in the future of the ihine
The promoters submit this property as a legiti’

A telegram has just been received from Cool-

just been struck in the shaft on the New Victoria
line of reef in lease No. 1639,. showing gold, and
that it has not yet been passed through.
This should have an important bearing on the
prospeots of the Westralia Extended.

Mar Lodge, the Duke of Fife’s home in
the Heelands, had the proud privilege of being
burnt out under the eye of England’s
royalty. The cablegrammer mentions with a
gratified smirk that ‘'the conflagration was wit-
nessed by Her Majesty,” who probably sat at one
of the windows of Balmoral Castle and thanked
merciful .Providence that her distinguished
relative was fully covered by insurance.
The early death of Miss Violet Yarley,
which elicited so widespread an expression of
sympathy throughout Australia, has been grace-
fully commemorated by the issue of a new song
specially written to illustrate the career of the
deceased songstress, and accompanied by an excel-
lent portrait of her. The song is named “In an
Old Wardrobe,” and is published at 2a., post free,
by Messrs. W. H. Glen and Co., of Melb. The
charming musical setting is the work of Mr.
W. J. Turner.
Within a few years the name of Dr. :
Jaeger has become a household word in the Eng- |
lish-speaking world; especially in these colonies 1
hardly anyone will be found who has not heard j
the name and who will not think at once of the !
natural woollen under-clothing that bears his
stamp. It is not so widely-known that the famous |
doctor himself attributes equal importance to the
question of the outerclothing. At present, many
people wear outer-garments made up from good
woollen materials, but the benefit to be derived
therefrom is lost by the insertion of cotton linings,
also of interlinings and paddings of questionable
materials. “Man should clothe himself in accor-
dance with the dictates of nature, which provides
animal fibre for his covering.” It took a long
time, until the heretic tailors were converted to
the new gospel, but the demand for the woollen
linings has steadily increased. The London
Jaeger Company opened the other day a special
depot in Conduit-street, London \V.,and arrange-
ments have been made at the Sydney and Mel-
bourne branches to supply these linings, which,
at a small additional expense, ensure to the wearer
the greatest comfort and increased immunity
against the climatic changes.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The haggard woman sat on a step under the
electric-light, by the main entrance of the theatre.
She had a child on one arm, two more beside her, a
pile of papers on her knee, and a cigar-box, full of
matches, boot-laces and bone studs, on the pave-
ment by her foot.
A gentleman stepped out of the “ marble bar ”
opposite, stood for a moment on the kerb, glanced
at his watch and then across at the theatre. He
crossed over, and put his hand in his pocket as he
reached the pavement.
“Paper, sir?” cried the newsboy. “ Here y’are,
mister—News, Stau.”
But “mister” had noticed the woman and
walked towards her.
“Paper, sir! News—Stab !” cried the boy,
dodging round in front; then, with a quick glance
from “ mister’s ” face to the news woman.
“ It’s all right, mister ! It’s all the same—she’s
my mother. . . . Thanks.”

Professor Leonard, the man from Chicago
who shone in the Mein, firmament for about 48
hours and then vanished, described himself
as “a veritable key of destiny, unlocking the
doors that lead to the temple of ease, health,
wealth, and influence.” The wizard couldn’t
expect to do much for himself in that line of art.

The Bishop of Salisbury was somewhat
shocked during his recent Australian tour by
“the struggle and competition and the commercial
spirit which infected communities of our brethren”
in the church and chapel trade. Seems as though
mother Salisbury must have travelled incognito
in Sunday morning trains, from which the church-
wardens look out of window at. the weather, and
say “ VVe ought to have a good collection,” or “It
looks bad for the plate,” as the case may be. To
get a, fair idea of, say, Melb. religion and its
inner workings, one must travel with the frock-
coated, dissenting-bearded gentry in the Sabbath
morning trains. The shepherd is paid a good
salary, and the management prays that the rain-
clouds will hold off until the tabernacle is
crowded.
A tine bush-horror is reported from Toora-
weunah (N.S. W.). A man made a fire at the foot
of a tree, and camped for the night. Naturally,
the tree burned through and fell on him, pinning
him to the ground. It kept on burning, the fire
approaching him almost imperceptibly. For
hours he yelled in hoarse discords for assistance,
hut the people who heard him assumed that it was
only a man in the horrors, and, apparently, men
like that are common at Tooraweenah, for nobody
came near him. He scratched up the soil franti-
cally with his nails and threw it at the fire, but it
still burned on. At last it reached him and
burned a place about the size of a dinner-plate—
burned it “almost through to the intestines”
cheerfully remarks the local journalist, and then
the anguish nerved him to a superhuman effort,
and he lifted up the tree and writhed out. The re-
port ends with the off-hand statement that he is
“doing well,” as if he were merely an interesting
family event of the Gamp description. They
take their horrors in good part “ out west.’’

Various Verses .
Quacks ; Unregistered—and Otherwise.
In “Dr, de Lion, Clairvoyant” (published by
Angus and Robertson, of Sydney), the anti-
spiritualistic Dr. Knaggs discourses, to use his
own rather bumpy phraseology, “upon the sub-
jects of Medical Clairvoyance and Quackery, as
the pernicious outcome of certain defects in
medical legislation in New South Wales.”
The proverbial difficulty of proving a negative
doesn’t hamper Dr. Knaggs with the quacks as
it did with the spirits. It is but seldom
that the sceptic gets the chance of demonstrating
that a spook is no spook ; whereas, with the
quack, the matter is simple. “ Ho isn’t numbered
and labelled ’--away with him ! ”
It is easy to believe, as the author further
assures us, that “every incident herein depicted is
founded on fact.” The story in which Dr. Knaggs
embodies his animadversions consists mainly and
evidently of descriptions of actual occurrences —
strung upon a thin thread of crude melodrama,
embellished with a few really first-class horrors,
and presented with a blundering directness of
style which is not without a certain bizarre merit
of its own. Dr. Knaggs is, at all events, well
worth reading for his incidents, which, besides
being “frequent and painful and free,” are such,
in most cases, as could only be made use of by a
man who thoroughly understood what he was
talking about. There is no need for wild surprise
at the resultant translation of the gentleman who
thought to re-oxygenate his blood with 4oz. of
chlorate of potash to half-a-pint of water, but
only a medical man would have ventured to repre-
sent a drunken skipper as “ picking himself up ”
with a wincglassful, each, of spirits of chloroform
and sal-volatile! His must, indeed, have been
the dura marinorum ilia, and Dr. Knaggs reaches
his highest literary level in his description of the
after-apprehensions of the tyro in posology who
should have instructed this marine phenomenon
to make 20 hourly instalments of what he paid
into his astounded stomach in one tremendous
dose.
About quackery in general Dr. Knaggs has
little to say, except that—like the power of the
Crown, according to a famous House of Commons
resolution “it has increased, is increasing, and
ought immediately to be diminished !” “Medical
clairvoyance ” is the mark at which the doctor
aims most of his bounding rhetoric, though the
“ clear-seeing ” fraternity should nevertheless be
not a little obliged to him for selecting as its
fictional exemplar “a man of the highest mental
power and culture”—a person who, according to
the author’s own showing, made excellent use,
under pretence of clairvoyance, of the medical
knowledge which he actually possessed. Dr.
Knaggs, like most enthusiasts, makes the tactical
error of proving too much, and it is a curious
“backing of his friends” to relate how—after
numerous duly-ticketed practitioners had suc-
cessively mal-“ treated ” a woman for liver, heart,
lungs, brain, and spleen—the pretended clair-
voyant, by the exercise of a little common observa-
tion, was able correctly to diagnose her ailment
and afford her the relief of which orthodoxy was
incapable. If any laugh comes in here, it is clearly
not against the “ quack.”
It is curious, moreover, that a man who, like
Dr. Knaggs, would so fiercely cast into outer
darkness the doctrine of clairvoyance, should have
so far taken into his bosom the not very dis-
tantly-related notion of “hypnotic suggestion” as
to seek therein an explanation of the easily other-
wise comprehensible influence of the villain of the
story upon a girl who, having taken to drink and
opium, timeously turns up in Sydney as a peg
whereon to hang a crowning catastrophe, ihe
nebulosity of the hypnotic notion according to Dr.
Knaggs, however, appears in the fact that whereas
the hero of the story is represented as having been
at one time hypnotically a mere automaton in the
hands of the villain, this same villain—when even-
tually the injured and vindictive hero proposes to
assassinate him with entirely new and original
effects—is apparently unequal to the very simple
and convenient “suggestion ” that said hero should
forthwith deliver himself over to the police as “of
unsound mind and unfit to be at large.” But the
hypnotic suggest!vism in which Dr. Knaggs be-
lieves resembles exactly, in this respect, the upiri-
tualism and clairvoyance against which he is con-
tinually crying aloud and sparing not—it goes
hopelessly “bung” the moment it is asked to do
anything of any practical use to anybody except
the professional converters of credulity into cash,
The central figure of the story—the adventurer
who modifies his name of Dillon into “ de Lion,”
and who might just as well have made it “ Dan-
de-Lion ” while he was about it-is evidently, in
many places, the mouthpiece of the author; in
which capacity his words are by no means
always those of either wisdom or good taste,
The airy complacency, for instance, with which
he brackets homeopathy with “faith-healing,
spiritualism, and other humbugs” is much on a
par with the smug superciliousness of the anti-
quated Melbourne .ZEsculapius who “believes there
is a man up-country who thinks he has discovered
in strychnine an antidote to snake-poison !”
Cheap oracularism of this sort is certainly not
characteristic of the real chiefs of a profession in
which the prizes do not always fall on the best
men, and which has no lack, within its sacred
enclosure, of be-lettered pretenders to a skill which
they do not possess.
The question of quackery, after all, is largely
one of degree. Whatever strides surgery may
have made, medicine proper is s ill little better
thanapok.ng m the darkand not oneaymanm
10,000 has any suspicion of the frequency of the
diagnostic and therapeutic blunders winch the
profession, for the sake of its collective repute
studiously endeavors to conceal. A medical
degree, mfact-whifeitmay mean,on theone hand,
that its holder is a born physician who has happ y
arrived, upon prescribed lines of study at is
natural vocation—may merely indicate, upon the
other, that its possessor, with perhaps a fine original
genius for butchering, or baking, or candlestick-
making—has barely scraped through an examina-
tion which entitles him to write himself Sangrado
instead of Dulcamara. But your Sangrado, of
the two, is the greater danger to the community,
and the plain man—bearing in mind such matters,
for instance, as the cheerful alacrity with which
the heroine of one shuddersome Sydney affair was
certified to as intacta, and the delightful toxico-
logical incertitude of the Dean ease—will be in no
hurry to confine the term “quack ” to those whose
mistakes are not secundum artem, and whose in-
competence is undisguised by any corporative im-
primatur.
All of whioh, however, furnishes no reason why
New South Wales should remain for ever the
paradise to which, from the ends of the earth,
resorts the medico-swindler of every degree—or of
no degree, and Dr. Knaggs will have rendered the
lieges a solid service if his book shall succeed in
opening the eyes of that astonishingly large
number of them who, while reasonably or un-
reasonably distrustful of the “ Art and Mystery
of Medicine,” deliver themselves over with
fatuous credulity to the mystery without the art !
It is a popular fallacy that the treadmill
used in British prisons involves the expenditure of
a large amount of physical force without the
smallest possible result. As a matter of fact, it
either pumps water or grinds flour for the prison.
All the same, it is a cruel and wanton torture,
prolific chiefly of varicose veins and vexation of
spirit.
The “ other-siders” are growing impudent,
not to say offensive, in Westralia. At Beverley,
lately, a small party of them, by way of a bitter
comment on the ways of the Westralian mail-
train, borrowed a railway-trolly and kept just ahead
of the train for seven miles, while they consoled
the driver and fireman with a wild chords of “ ’E
duuno where ’e are.” The locomotive made the
biggest effort of its life in its struggles to run over
the roysterers, but all to no purpose.

From Sydney Evening News :
Large numbers of unemployed arriving in the north to
geek employment at cane-cutting. If cane-cutting will
reduce the number of unemployed, that is one more
reason against interfering with an exceptionally circum-
stanoed trade.
Why, certainly 1 Cane-cutting will obviously re-
duce the number of unemployed. And every
other industry which now exists in N.S.W.
through Protection, and is likely to be destroyed
under the new tariff, will also, if not interfered
with, either reduce the number of the unemployed
or else prevent large additions being made to their
number. And they are all “ exceptionally situ-
ated.” The Evening News constantly asserts
that Freetrade will_ lift a great burden off the
country and make it rich, and that Protection
keeps it poor. The unemployed are the natural
consequence of poverty. Then, if the News has
any semblance of faith in its own creed, let it
howl its loudest for absolute, unalloyed Freetrade
so that these unemployed may be relieved ; and
not sit miserably on a fence and try to get down
on both sides of it at once.
THE BIOGRAPHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The great man’s soul ha» now forever flown
The scenes of every vict’ry and defeat,
While those whom he in life had never known
Exchange the maudlin mournings in the street,
Reciting loud his record from the roll
Type-filtered and distorted to the view ;
All cry for wordsmiths to inscribe his scroll —
But who ? But who ?
Not you, pen-prostitute, with eager ink
To flow where’er your hirers may direct,
Concerned in naught beyond what they may
think;
Your wish—but to supply what they expect,
To eulogise or censure as ’tis told ;
You care not what may be his rightful due
So long as you can trade your words for gold.
Not you. Not you.
Not you, with heart by loveless life made sour,
Joined without love and with desire still less,
Tliat he might taste the dead sea-fruit of power,
You—'advertise your grief with costly dress.
Too weak to boldly love and bear the gibe,
Children you bore to one you never knew ;
No less a stranger was the hireling scribe.
Not you. Not you.
Not you, with name of God as stock-in-trade
Threatening the weak and cringing to the great,
Lying to all by whom your wage is paid,
Claiming all good on earth to regulate;
Neat sentences of fulsome praise you turn
With copious tears well placed in public view
Commensurate with guineas that you earn.
Not you. Not you.
Not you, esteemed companion of his life,
Who fought ahd stole and lied with him who
died,
Who, midst the storm and sweat of daily strife,
Took manfully your welcome stand beside,
Helping him onwards, upwards to the goal.
Still! ’twas at best the husk of him you knew ;
You never saw the secrets of his soul.
Not you. Not you.
But you, who felt his passionate caress,
Beside whose true, fond love he reckoned
naught
The puerile plaudits of a paudar press,
The cheers of craven crowds for whom he
fought.
You, to whose eyes his heart he did unveil,
Who knew each virtue there and every blot;
You are the only one to tell his tale —
And you will not.

The Squatter .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We m u t him at Pierson'* private bar during the
wool-sales, and he talked of sheep, and clips, and,
above all, of “ his place.” The man’s exterior did
not give the impression of the owner of countless
flocks and herds ; but then, as the doctor remarked,
“These great pastoralists often dress as meanly
as swagmeu.” lie carried a large pocket-book,
whose plump proportions he would often refer to
in a casual way ; but it chanced on more than one
occasion, when a big score for drinks had to be
paid for, that he found his cheque-book had, by
some unaccountable oversight, been left at his
hotel.
“ Great men are often so forgetful,’’ the doctor
explained to me, as he cheerfully paid the reckon-
ing.
“You must come down to my place,” the squat-
ter would say as he parted from us ; “I am getting
tired of asking you, but if you want to have a
month’s real pleasure, wallaby drives, kangaroo
Stalking, and a genuine country home of the right
stamp, then come along. Send me a wire at any
time and my drag shall be at the station to meet
you.’’ This was how it came about that the
doctor said to me :
“ Let us go and sp-nd Easter with the squatter.
We shall have a bit of sport, a spell from the
grind, and a royal reception from our old friend.
1 am sure he will be offended if we deeliae his
invitation any longer.”
A long journey by a western train, and we were
deposited at a bush siding. No trap was there,
no hotel or township, nothing but the wild bush,
a weatherboard accommodation-house, and a rail-
way porter.
Evidently our wire had missed delivery, but we
were cheered to learn that the mail-coach would
take us within half-a-mile of Johnston’s place.
An hour later, like two Robinson Crusoes, a
gun on each shoulder, we left the mailman and
plunged into the bush-track he had told us to
follow. Our bulky belongings we had hidden in
the scrub.
A sound of chopping ahead, and we came to a
familiar figure astride a fallen apple-tree.
“Well, this is good of you,” exclaimed the
squatter joyfully as he extended towards us two
hands smeared with honey. “ Welcome to
Wooltergatta ! You are just in time to taste
some of my honey;” and he handed us each a
piece of comb from the hollow of the tree. “Now,
that is what I call honey—none of your Sydney
glucose about that, hey ! But come along ; you
must want some lunch.”
The squatter in moleskin pants and flannel
shirt, bare-headed and bare-footed, led the way
with a step of lordly hospitality.
“ Why did you not send a wire? I would have
had one of my fellows to meet you. Came by the
coach, I suppose? Beastly shaky old trap—a dis-
grace to 4 the district; but come along up to the
house.”
A three-acre clearing dotted with stumps, a
bark humpy and a lean-to shed.
“How is that for a homestead now? Look at
the view 1 Look at the prospect! I call that the
finest site for a residence on this continent. Leave
your guns there, under the verandah, and I will
take you up to the lavatory. You must want a
wash after your long journey ; then I will present
you to Mrs. Johnson—she will be as delighted as
she can be.”
The squatter led the way to a water-hole. Here
we “ sloushed ” our hands and faces, taking for a
towel some loose stringy-bark.
“ Nature’s fountain, my boys. The bath of the
gods. What do you think of that? None of
your Menzies’ hotel about my place, eh 1”
cheerfully agreed with him as we vainly
endeavoured to free our skin and clothes from the
g brftg
M s. Johnson, a red headed lady in a print
skirt and a slip body of flour-bag material, greeted
us on our return to the hut. “ You must wait a
* J ' t > misters, till I get you a bite of tucker; you
must be real hungry to be sure.”
Qn fcbe table there waB boiled p Urnpkini damper.
a bone u f corned beef, and empty jam-tins filled
with black tea. The doctor found a gin-case, I a
stool, and we drew up next to an assorted crew of
shock-headed youngsters.
“Now, this is what I call a bit of beef,” said
the squatter, flourishing his knife. “ I never kill
a beast over four years old ; that’s the prime age,
and I like it prime, you make no mistake.”
“ Why, dad, that’s a bit of the cow the dingoes
killed in the gully,” interjected one of the young-
sters.
The squatter did not heed the remark, or alter
for a moment his bland, benevolent smile,
“Now, try those pumpkins, you will find them
genuine—grown in my own garden—l can recoin-
m*-nd them. Make yourselves quite at home;
from the cellar to the garret, all is at your dis-
posal.”
For some minutes the doctor and I wrestled nn-
successfully with the slices of hide or hoof the
squatter had hacked off for us, drank the nauseous
tea made with creek-water, and chewed the heavy
chunks of damper.
“If you have finished your snack, gentlemen,
come and see the new house.” He led the way to
a cleared hill-side. “ How is that for a residence,
now !” and the squatter waved his hand as though
in front of a majestic building. “This is the
terrace with the marble steps—you will notice that
the drawing-room opens on to it with French case-
ments. The entrance hall is wide and spacious—l
like room to turn round. But come along this
passage to the billiard-room. There now ! Did
you ever see an apartment better lighted ? I have
given an amount of study to this room you would
hardly credit.”
We looked on inamazement. A few wooden pegs,
stuck here and there in the ground, were the only
substantial parts of the regal structure the
squatter conducted us over.
“Yon are not going home again? Why, I ex-
paotad you to stay a month at least; it will take
yon that time to thoroughly test the sport on my
run. Well, if you must, you must; I will force no
man. Let me call some of my hands to harness
up the sulky.”
But for some mysterious reason Bill, Tom and
Harry did not come when they were called. The
sulky, too, was unfortunately undergoing repairs
at a neighboring town, and the quest ended by a
freckled-faced boy catching an old horse and
harnessing him up to a wood-dray,
“Take your seats, gentlemen! Take your
seats !” The squatter was on the off shaft. “They
may say what they like about coaches and car-
riages, and, of course, a man in my position has to
keep them ; but for real solid comfort give me a
well-built dray. Now I know this dray, every
stick of it ; there is not a better in the country ;
you are real safe once you are aboard, that I will
guarantee. Now don’t she ride light? Fancy you
were in a feather-bed on a spring-mattress. When
I have a dray built ”
There was no end to the squatter’s talk. Even
when he had seen us safely seated in the returning
mail-coach, he was full of pressing invitations for
us to come again.
“ You should come when you have more time.
You have not seen my wool-shed, and the irriga-
tion plant alone would be a real lesson to you.”
We drew a sigh of relief as the coacli drove on.
“What is he?” enquired the doctor of the
coachman, nodding his head towards the squatter,
who was standing upon the dray, waving an adieu.
“ Harmless, quite harmless!” replied the driver,
throwing his nose in the air.
N.S.W.
HENRY FLETORER.
Perhaps the best epigram in “An Ideal
Husband’’: “A question is never indiscreet:
answers always are.”
Eugene, the ex-bookrnaker and prophet,
who foretold the total destruction of Maoriland
and induced a number of people to fly with him to
South Africa for safety, has been heard from. His
party of believers took the train from Cape Town
as far as the railway goes, and then hired wag-
goners to hump their belongings right out into the
dim infinite of the North. It was an indefinite
sort of contract, and after four weeks travelling it
was closed by the waggoners up-ending the sticks
of the believers on the banks of the Mashona
River, 230 miles from anywhere, and starting for
home. The- pilgrims settled down there and
waited for the promised cataclysm. They lived
by shooting while their ammunition held out, and
when it was finished they overtook slow animals
and hit them with the butt-end. Then they
somehow discovered that the convulsion hadn’t
arrived and Maoriland remained where it was,
and thereupon they, decided, as all such pilgrims
do, to get home again, and proceeded to pound
their gaunt mules along the interminable back-
track to the Capa. The prophet, however, was
left behind on account of “ some trouble about a
horse,” and by this time has possibly been eaten
by a hyaena—at least hopes are entertained to that
effect.
A Maoriland syndicate is making another
effort to recover the ,£140,030 in gold which went
down along with the General Grant among fne
Auckland isles in 1857. The General Grant had
87 passengers on board—mostly of the roaring
“luoky-digger” species, and one windless, pitch-
dark night a mysterious current drifted her into a
cavern among the islands. Her masts scraped
along the roof of the cave, and brought down a
rain of rook fragments which killed many people,
and maimed many more. Then she stove herself
in and sank peacefully many fathoms deep. Four-
teen men and one woman got ashore, and settled
down to lead an idyllic existence on fish and hope,
until something would turn up. But it was long in
turning up, and after six mouths four of them went
away in the solitary boat to look for Maoriland.
and were heard of nevermore. The others waited a
year longer, and then a whaler from Bluff harbor
found them and took them off. As for the afore-
mentioned £140,030, it is supposed to be still lying
around at the sea-bottom, and possibly a million
tons of sand have gathered on top of it by this
time. Anyhow, in spite of many attempts, not
one copper has been recovered —so far as anybody
is aware. As the person who recovered it would
probably say as little as he could on the subject,
however, for fear of claimants, it is quite likely
that the money has been found and drunk long
ago, and that the syndicate is getting its feet wet
on a fool’s errand.
The Age triumphs over the with a
charge of plagiarism from London Spectator,
which it clearly proves with parallel columns.
About a year ago, the Argus unearthed a similar
plagiarism on the part of the Age from Sydney
Smith, and an AGE-man was dismissed. The
heroics of the accusing journal in such cases are
preposterous. The reasonable inference, of course,
is that the accused journal has been swindled by
one of its staff, not that it is a swindler itself.
The hopelessness of the Turkish Empire
is almost pathetic. At the present time the
Sultan is under orders from “the Powers’’ to
provide the Armenian provinces with a certain
number of Christian officials. The end of Moham-
medan supremacy in Armenia must be very near
to the end of the Sultan’s sovereignty.
Ex-Commandant Tulloch, who tells them
at ’Ome that Victoria is damned beyond redemp-
tion by State Socialism and Payment of Members,
and a general want of veneration, shuffled two of
his sons into the army—one as a nominee of Melb.
University, the other as a nominee of the Vic.
Govt., whilst he occupied the position of Military-
Commandant down South. Evidently Tulloch
knows what he is talking about when he sneers at
the style of administration in vogue by the balmy
Yarra;
Countess Wachtmeister, the present Theo-
sophical missionary to Australia, maybe termed a
ghost of Mrs. Besant’s spiritual self. The
Wachtmeister discourses begin and end with the
philosophy she has adopted, whereas her famous
friend often treated of social questions from
worldly standpoints, whilst Theosophy lay dark
off the weather-bow. Theosophy, in Mrs. Besant’s
lectures, used to wait for an opening before sail-
ing right in, and sometimes it was 9.30 p.m. ere
the opening presented itself. Countess Wacht-
meister is a Low-Church Theosophist. She sticks
closely to the Word of Blavatsky. But this
plump, self-contained lady, who is more feminine
than Annie Besant, will gain converts as
she goes along. The doctrine of reincarna-
tion is not unimpressively preached by
Countess Wachtmeister. She knows her philo-
sophy well, although she doesn’t make the ;
m >st of it on the platform. There is a want of
oouseoutiveness in her sermon. She seems to fire
off each long sentence as it comes to her memory,
without a critical regard for its bearing upon the
previous announcement. Each sentence, how-
ever, has been carefully prepared, and if the
countess’s oratory proceeds jerkily it can’t often
be accused of wobbling. Moreover, all Theosophy
is good, a corrective to the fundamentally im-
moral isms of this world, and the adult inhabi-
tants of Australia are herewith recommended to
buy at least one packet of the Wachtmeister
specific and apply it to their immortal souls. It
can do them no harm, it may make honest, high-
thinking people of them. This exhortation is parti-
cularly addressed to regular attendants at places
of worship.

(he largest requirement, suitable for DRY COLD STORAGE
ROOMS, BUTCHERS, DAIRY FACTORIES and ICE FACTORIES.
Simple in construction, cheap to run, efficient and economical.
LAVAL and ALPHA CREAM SEPARATORS,

60,000 LA VAL SEPARATORS in DAILY USE.
Capacity from 12 to 60 gallons per hour for hand-power, and
100 to 300 gallons for steam-power. Prices, £lO upwards.
Using a poor Cream Separator means great animal loss in
moi ey returns. Several factories having discovered this have
put in Alpha separators, so as to get the greatest possible
amount of butter out of the milk, and with the least working
expenses.
