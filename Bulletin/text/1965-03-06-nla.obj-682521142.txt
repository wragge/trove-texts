Ampol —fast-growing company in a fast-growing country
The construction of a £21,000,000 petrol
refinery in Queensland is a significant step
forward in Ampof's rapid expansion. When
it comes "on stream" in mid-1965 it will
complete another phase in a programme
which already includes oil search, dis-
tribution, refining and marketing. As one
of the first nine public companies in
Australia, Ampol is a dynamic example
of Australian expansion. Illustration above
shows construction of Ampol's own refinery
nearing completion at Lytton, Brisbane.

National Notebook
Publishing Coup
PFhe valuable and hotly contested Eng-
lish language rights to Pope John’s
diary, “The Journal of a Soul”, were won
by a 34-year-old Australian, Geoffrey
Chapman, who, until then, had barely
got a toehold into the highly competitive
field of English publishing.
Chapman, who attended Xavier, Mel-
bourne, left for London as soon as he
finished his law degree at Melbourne
University. He and his wife, Suzanne,
an honors arts graduate of the same
university, worked at different jobs in
London before Chapman began to
establish himself in publishing.
One of his first books was a series
of talks given by Catholic students of
Melbourne University at one of their
annual conferences. He began to build
up a list of good titles by obtaining
English rights on some swift-selling
American books and translating out-
standing Continental writers. He was
soon confident enough to turn down
an American takeover offer.
The Italian publishers of Pope John’s
journal, Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura,
normally publish scholarly works in
their original language. They published
the journal because Pope John was a
close friend of the founder of the pub-
lishing house, Monsignor Giuseppe de
Luca.
When “The Journal of a Soul” was
published in Italy. Chapman flew to
Rome and convinced the Italian pub-
lishers that he could guarantee a faith-
ful translation and a dignified presenta-
tion of the diary. He then took a plane
to New York where he reached agree-
ment with McGraw Hill for them to
publish his translation in North
America.
The Italian edition has sold nearly
50,000 copies' and a fourth, popular
edition to sell for less than the £3
charged so far, is being prepared. The
book has also already appeared in Ger-
man, Spanish. Catalan, French, Dutch,
Portuguese, Greek and Japanese.
Floating a Company
T ast week we came across a new com-
pany that has been floated—quite
literally. The company—a film and art
producing venture —is embodied in a
60ft solid teak Chinese junk. Directors
and shareholders are eight Australians.
“We bought the junk as a floating
headquarters from which to produce
documentary films and paintings. We’ve
even established a gallery in Paddington
to handle our output,” director Tony
Pike told us.
Among the crew is big-game hunter
Tony Buckston who has hunted wild
animals and equally ferocious barracuda.
Besides being an expert cameraman,
Buckston is also a marine biologist. Part
of his subject matter for filming will be
supplied by underwaterman John Gil-
christ, an ex-Navy frogman who has
devised the fascinating idea of having
himself lowered in a cage while the
others throw bloody bait to attract
sharks. As the sharks tear at the meat
—and each other—he will direct
cameras to capture what the adventurers
believe will be most original submarine
documentary shots.
Artists Geoff Pike—brother of the
director—and Bob Booth will organise
a daily output of paintings to be air-
freighted back to their Paddington gal-
lery as a sort of running exhibition.
“The Maritime Services Board has
given us permission to tie up at Cir-
cular Quay,” skipper Noel Stroud told
us. “We plan to make the junk a floating
art gallery open to the public on March
2, 3 and 4. That'll give people some
idea of the sort of work to expect when
we set up our headquarters in Fiji.
We were shown through the 'vast
ship which, they assured us, had already
sailed through two typhoons since its
launching last year in Hong Kong. “The
Chinese have been building boats like
this for three thousand years. They’ve
never changed the design,” Stroud said.
“Of course we have twin Gardner
diesels and I’m having a more conven-
tional suit of sails cut. But for going
in and out of port it'll be the junk sails.
Every film we make will begin and end
with the One Step majestically sailing
past the camera.”
Pike said, he had already investigated
the possibility of placing documentary
films. “I flew over to the US. I told
them these would be the real thing, not
much like ‘Adventures in Paradise.’
I'm pretty sure we can give the distribu-
tors what they want, but don’t forget the
whole thing is a business venture. It’s
just that we believe we can get away
from the rat race and still do business.
We called the junk One Step because the
Chinese have a proverb that's apt: ‘A
journey of a thousand leagues begins
with one step’. We believe we’ll go far
with this. We’re planning on a five-
year programme.”
A laconic wharf type at their fitting-
out berth in Sydney’s Rushcutters Bay
was equally optimistic. “If they can’t do
what they want all they have to do is
saw all that teak into two by four and
flog it to the building trade. They’d
make a tidy profit out of that.”
Only on Sundays
HThe Rev. Don Brady is the first
A Aboriginal minister with church status
appointed in Queensland. His church is
the newly reopened, newly repainted
Leichhardt Street Methodist Church in
the City-Spring Hill section of Brisbane.
Substantial buildings beside the church
indicate where big business is creeping
into the area. The area is also well
served with hotels. Drunks and derelicts
made a shambles of the church when it
was not in use. Because the church can’t
afford either a caretaker or a home for
the minister, the church is open only
on Sundays.
During the week, Mr Brady is based
at the West End Methodist Mission and
works under the superintendent there.
On Sundays, he gives two morping ser-
mons at other churches and at night
conducts the service in his own church.
Some afternoons particularly on Sun-
days—he preaches in South Brisbane
parks.
“It is difficult to get people’s atten-
tion. No one exactly argues but there are
drunks white and colored. Sunday
afternoons are the best time in the parks
because everyone is sober.”
But Mr Brady knew there would be
difficulties when he became converted to
“real Christianity” at the age of 20.
Born on Palm Island, North Queensland,
38 years ago, he reached only fourth
grade at school. He was in turn bullock
driver, ploughman and ply-mill worker.
He first went to a missionary college
in New South Wales. Later, he joined
the Australian Inland Mission, working
for the most part in New South Wales
and North Queensland. Two years ago

he joined the West End Methodist Mis-
sion. “I’m accepted here,” he said. “The
superintendent here understands me. I’m
very fortunate. I can go to him for
advice but he doesn’t say do this and do
that. I can get on with my work in my
own way.”
Getting on with his work in his own
way means a non-stop week for Mr
Brady. “Our people are scattered every-
where. I get calls from all over Bris-
bane. I also visit them in hospital and
in the gaols. White people? Yes, if
they call me, I go to them . . .”
“White neighbors often make things
difficult for the colored man when he
comes to the city. This happens when
he is quiet and well behaved. Some
colored people who come to the city
do drink too much but this is often a
matter of acceptance and environment.
There are places often bad hotels
where the colored man knows that he
will be accepted, so he goes there. Like
the white man he drinks too much, gets
quarrelsome and is thrown out. But
he’ll come back to the same place be-
cause it’s where he knows he is ac-
cepted.
“We see God as the great Spirit,”
Mr Brady said. “But we don’t visualise
Christ as a Negro. We remember that
He was a Jew a Man who is neither
black nor white.”
Alice, Who Art Thou?
Although Edward Albee’s second
full-length play, “Tiny Alice”, is
having tremendous success on Broad-
way, it seems doubtful whether we’ll
see it here for some time. The Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust, at least, is not
entirely confident that it could repeat
with “Tiny Alice” the success it had
with “Virginia Woolf”.
Already in America the critics have
moved out of the field, leaving it to the
theologians and psychiatrists. Theo-
logians have been busy tracking down
Biblical parallels. The students of the
Union Theological Seminary have been
sent along to see it. They found that
the central characters, the lay brother,
Julian, and the wealthy Miss Alice are
actually Christ and His church; that the
champagne wedding supper is literally
the Last Supper; that Julian’s six years
in a mental home correspond to the six
years "“required to become a priest; that
Christ was sold for 30 pieces of silver
and Julian for millions; that the butler
gives Julian a “Judas kiss” as he lies
dying; and that the meaning of the
crucifixion at the end of the play was
entirely obvious.
The psychiatrists have also been
busy. Each playgoer to the Billy Rose
Theatre is handed a programme with an
insertion quoting liberally from the in-
terpretation of Dr Abraham Franzblau,
who found the play dramatised the
death struggle between Eros, the life
force, and Thanatos, the death drive.
“Albee tries to pluck the masks from
life and death, sex, love and marriage,
God, faith and organised religion,
money-greed, wealth, charity and even
celibacy,” Dr Franzblau wrote. “He
penetrated the superficial layers of our
conscious personality and, using the
mysterious escalators of the uncon-
scious, reaches the citadel of our private
certainties and shoots them full of ques-
tion marks.”
Children of Asia
TN the Newport hills north of Sydney
this week local children were taking
direction from film - maker Gunnar
Isaacson like professionals.
They were helping in the final
sequences of a TV series of 18 films
Isaacson has been working on for two
years, shooting in 15 different countries,
chiefly in Asia.
Gunnar Isaacson told us that the
series, which will take another three
months to complete, is meant to foster
understanding and knowledge of our
Asian neighbors, especially among chil-
dren. Swedish-born Isaacson, who came
to Australia 15 years ago, said he got
the idea when he was travelling through
Asia some years ago. More than 50 of
his half-hour films have already been
shown on TV here.
The line of the story is that a group
of Australian children meet a friend
who has just received a letter from
three penfriends in Malaysia. This
arouses their interest and the other
children start writing. Soon a kind of
club atmosphere develops and the chil-
dren get together to discuss the letters
they receive from their various friends
every week.
Isaacson said he didn’t quite realise
just how big the undertaking was when
he started. He has had to improvise
nearly all the way, quite apart from
trying to make himself understood with
sign language and bits and pieces of
phrases he managed to pick up. Once
when he was filming children in Viet-
nam, a village half a mile away went
up in flames. The children were unper-
turbed and the show went on. The
burning village is the background of one
of the sequences.
Boris Cook
11/'E record with great sadness the
death, by drowning in the Trobriand
Islands, of photographer Boris Cook. A
series of photographs of the Mt
Hagen Show by Mr Cook appeared in
The Bulletin in 1963. In recent months
he had. done cover portraits for us of
the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, the
Most Rev. H. R. Gough, and the Vice-
Chancellor of the University of NSW,
Professor J. Baxter.
Mr Cook brought great skill and
imagination to his films, notably the one
of the Mt Hagen Show and one on
painter William Dobell, who was well
known to him.
OFF TO SOUDAN
ffifeulletia
80 Years Ago: March 7, 1885
fS/E have had school-mates obtain
** their commissions, strut in uni-
form and go off to help suppress the
Indian Mutiny. We have seen the
Guards march through London on
their way to embark for the Crimea.
These were partings and pageants
never to be forgotten. The multitudes
hoarse with cheering; the roar of
voices only lulling for a moment to
gain breath for fresh cheers, the
waving handkerchiefs and shrill hur-
rahs of women; the agitation and
emotion are beyond simulation.
We have now seen the New South
Wales Contingent depart to fight
the Soudanese, and the contrast
has been chilling. If the hearts of
the multitude were with them,
then in this fervent clime of
Australia a people strangely cold and
undemonstrative has grown up. The
multitude seemed to have no voice.
It was a grand picnic. But it was a
remarkably significant demonstration
coldly significant.
S.M. Herald speaks of the feel-
ing in favour of the colonial
military expedition as almost universal
throughout the Australian dominions,
and then it dubs Sir Henry Parkes’
resistance to the movement as an
attempt to regain popularity!

PLAIN ENGLISH
Deciding Not To Win
As the crisis in South Vietnam deep-
ens, the demands for withdrawal
are intensifying under some such
face-saving formula as negotiation.
The fact remains, however, that there
is nothing to negotiate in South Viet-
nam, and the loss of it to the Com-
munists would destroy not only Ame-
rican prestige but Australian security.
There is simply no alternative to hold-
ing on and ultimately winning.
Far more alarming than the Left-
wing demand that the Free World with-
draw from South Vietnam is the in-
creasingly vocal support for the same
policy by Americans who fully realise
what a disaster this would be and who
have until now advocated a larger
military commitment to South-East
Asia. These people now believe it is
obvious that America intends to with-
draw; that even the moderate retalia-
tory bombing of North Vietnam was
merely a form of negotiation as if
to tell the Communists that while we
will “negotiate” out, we still have to
keep a semblance of self-respect and
not be humiliatingly pushed out; and
that, since we are going to retreat,
let’s do it now and stop the pointless
killing of young Americans.
This .approach has the twisted “rea-
listic” appeal of a lot -of “tough-
minded” pessimism, but there is still
no occasion to assume that it is true.
The position, however, is grave enough
to require much heavier American
military commitment and America’s
taking over control of all military ope-
rations. It also requires a much heavi-
er Australian commitment, particularly
in the light of the historic British “East
of Suez” White Paper which, despite
what the “realistic” pessimists have
predicted for years, has now committed
Britain to the maintenance of freedom
in South-East Asia. The British al-
ready had 50,000 crack troops there
before the White Paper, whereas Aus-
tralia still only has 5000.
One major point that is often
ignored is that there is no reason why,
given its vast and superior strength,
the Free World should be beaten in
South Vietnam or anywhere in South-
East Asia. It was not beaten in North
Korea, and even the French were not
beaten in Vietnam; what happened was
that the Western powers chose not to
win; they decided the wars were not
worth winning. This cannot be said
of South Vietnam.
Not Enough To Go Round?
VI/hatever success the “freedom
” riders” have had in winning pub-
licity for Aborigines, it is especially im-
portant now that this publicity should
not become an excuse for avoiding the
real problem. This is above all not a
race problem, but a slum clearance
problem. New South Wales is not
Mississippi—whatever some naive re-
porters and some quite un-na'fve Com-
munists may say. When the people in
the country towns claimed that dis-
crimination was based not on skin
color but on “hygiene”, they were, for
the most part, drawing attention to
the plain fact that many Aborigines
continue to live in camps which are
centres of disease, vice and crime and
that, with the best will in the world,
no one wants his children to mix with
such people. The equally plain fact
that Aborigines who do not live this
sort of life and meet the ordinary
standards of civilisatiQn are not dis-
criminated against, further proves this
point.
This, of course, is no reason for re-
joicing and crying Holier-than-Missis-
sippi. It simply moves the problem
one step back. The crying need is to
take community and Government
action to clear up these Aboriginal
slums and to encourage Aborigines to
educate themselves in everything from
hygiene to scholarship. This will be an
uphill task and will take a long while,
But it is in this slow, time-consuming,
undramatic enterprise of getting Abo-
rigines to want to undertake the slow,
time-consuming, undramatic task of
helping themselves that real progress
will be made.
What is the point of denying, for
example, that NSW has so many
groups ranging from Rotary Clubs to
RSLs who are anxious, for example,
to put an Aborigine through university?
But there are simply not enough Abo-
rigines to go round —• because there
are not yet enough Aboriginal families
who encourage their children to take
advantage of the primary and second-
ary education opportunities already
available to them.
The recent “freedom ride” served
a purpose. But it must not be al-
lowed to become a cheap and easy way
of avoiding the real problem. 4
Satire
T ast week Judge Levine again re-
established common sense in the
application of the laws of obscenity in
NSW when he upheld the appeal of
the editor, artist and printer of “Oz”
magazine against the fines and gaol
sentences a magistrate had imposed
on them in September, 1964. This was
in line with his judgment in the “Tha-
runka” case last year when he finally
turned the tide in what was otherwise
an annus mirabilis of Australian cen-
sorship a year which saw official
action of one sort or another against
such books as “The Group” and
“Lolita”, such magazines as “Oz” and
“Tharunka”, and against university lib-
raries in Canberra, Perth and Sydney.
In his “Oz” judgment, Judge
Levine maintained his earlier liberal
view that an “undue emphasis on sex”
is not in itself actionable, that it must
be an undue emphasis of a depraving
or corrupting kind. (Otherwise what
popular magazine would escape pro-
secution?) He further made it clear that
any allegation of corruption must be
reasonably precise, that the pro-
secution must show “not some mere
theoretical, nebulous or fanciful ten-
dency but a real and practical ten-
dency to deprave not a theoretical
group of unidentified persons but per-
sons or groups whom the court in
judgment can refer to as those likely
to be affected.” He also made clear
that satire is a legitimate literary form
(even if “Oz” sometimes maintains a
low standard and has published words
that would breach the Vagrancy Act
were they spoken in a public place).
Another promising development last
week was the decision by Dr John
Power to appeal to the High Court
against the Customs Department’s
seizure of his copy of the book “The
Ginger Man”—the first time in Aus-
tralian history that a citizen has chal-
lenged the Customs Department in this
way. If he succeeds in this action, we
may expect the sort of liberalisation in
the Federal field that Judge Levine’s
judgments have marked in the State
field.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Disrupting the North:
After Isa Gladstone
The Communists' next target
BRISBANE Having got Mt Isa
hamstrung, the Communist Secretary of
the Queensland Trades and Labor Coun-
cil, Alex McDonald, now has the Glad-
stone operation beyond the planning
stage. One of the first steps was com-
pleted before McDonald left Brisbane
for his December trip to North Vietnam,
when he revived the defunct Gladstone
Trades and Labor Council at a con-
ference held in Gladstone on November
15. The next steps are easy to predict
on the Mt Isa pattern."
What attracts the Communists to Glad-
stone is that the formerly doomed town
has now become the site of Comalco’s
enormous aluminium project. The whole
prospect of Gladstone has been revolu-
tionised by this project and that what
might have become a ghost town is likely
to be the centre of the whole of Central
Queensland development.
When Swifts closed their meat export-
ing plant at Gladstone 18 months ago,
more than 1200 workers of the town's
population of 7000 faced economic ruin
or the prospect of chasing employment
elsewhere. But today the air of Gladstone
is electric with the promise of unparal-
leled prosperity and growth. A sparsely
populated region. Central Queensland as
a whole is now at the beginning of a
fantastic era of development. Already a
start has been made on the £l6 million
brigalow lands clearing and settlement
scheme in the Fitzroy River basin. This
scheme aims at bringing into production
more than 4,000,000 acres of hitherto
desolate land before 1969.
The associated projects, the Calcap
power station ouLide Biloela and the Cal-
lide Dam, will be completed in 1965 at
a total cost of almost £24 million. A new
wharf at Port Alma costing £700,000 is
nearing completion while the provision
of bulk loading facilities is well under
way in the port of Gladstone; £1 million
is being spent on a new Rockhampton
abattoir. The Queensland Railway De-
partment has already completed 'a £4
million rehabilitation project on the old
Moura-Gladstone rail link and is now en-
gaged on the construction of a £400,000
rail bridge over the Calliope River a few
miles north of Gladstone.
To cope with the growing demand,
more than £350.000 is being spent on im-
provements to Gladstone's water supply.
But even greater things are planned for
Cen ral Queensland and its new boom
town including a £52 million alumina
plant—the world’s largest—to be built
by Queensland Alumina Ltd. at Glad-
stone.
The Queensland Government is bend-
ing over backwards to encourage further
interstate and overseas investment in the
State. In the secondary industry field, it
has set up a Department of Industrial
Development under the able direction of
Sir David Muir, Queensland's former
Agent-General in London.
The chief advantage the Department
offers is its licence to cut much of the
usual red-tape in order to steer a new
enterprise into place as quickly as pos-
sibleT
The big weakness in the huge pro-
gramme which the Government and its
go-ahead Industrial Development Depart-
ment seem powerless to overcome is the
shortage of labor. This chink in the
Queensland armor affords professional
disruptors a ready-made opportunity to
thwart progress on developmental pro-
jects.
The occasion for Communist-organised
disruption to destroy Gladstone and Cen-
tral Queensland development on the Mt
Isa pattern was offered by the attempt
of Comalco to seek a consolidated site
award covering all construction and allied
unionists employed in. building the alu-
minium plant.
The terms of this proposed award, in
various degrees, are less favorable
than the existing Building Trades
Award. The "militants” were quick to
exploit this fact. They have countered
through the Communist - dominated
Queensland Trades and Labor Council
with demands which, in some cases, are
deliberately exorbitant.
The defunct provincial Trades and
Labor Council at Gladstone was revived
in the grand manner when a conference
sponsored by the parent Queensland
Trades and Labor Council was held at
Gladstone on November 15. Delegates
came from Rockhampton, Mt Morgan
and Bundaberg, and from building trade
unions.
According to the notice forwarded over
the signature of Communist Alex Mc-
Donald as the Queensland Trades and
Labor Council Secretary, the meeting was
convened to discuss:
(1) Immediate and long-range prob-
lems associated with employment on the
alumina project at Gladstone —to in-
clude union organisation job and local.
(2) “Examination of problems of
Trade Union organisation and associated
job organisation in Central Queensland,
and steps necessary to strengthen job,
union, and Labor Council organisation.”
This charter is designed to serve the
dual purposes of reviving the Gladstone
and Mt Morgan Trades and Labor Coun-
cils, to strengthen the Rockhampton and
Bundaberg Trades Hall Councils already
functioning, and to create the conditions
for rank and file discipline.
These’ councils constitute the key
industrial bodies in the mid-Queensland
area, and occupy a strategic geographical
position based on Rockhampton. Mour.i-
Biloela and G ! adstone A glance at the
map above will pinpoint the vital de-
ve'opmental area in this triangle. A
Left-wing domination of these councils,
through the Communist - dominated
parent body in Brisbane, would afford the
Communist Party a vital base through
which it could disrupt the widespread
development envisaged by the State
Government.
The real organisational value of these
councils will be to establish the very
rewarding Shop and Area Committee
machine for the control and discipline
of rank and file unionists, directed to-
wards industrial disruption as determined
from time to time.
In so far as Gladstone is concerned, the
Communist tactic will be to keep workers
out of the town, that is, to put a ban on
major construction works before they
begin.
A list of demands relating to construc-
tion work on the Alumina plant has been
formulated. Until these demands are
agreed to by the construction contractors,
workers from outside will be told not to


apply for jobs in Gladstone. The
demands include:
• Over-award payments to all on the
site.
• Uniform site allowance of £5.
• Free board and lodging.
• Travelling time and fares.
• No interference to workers’ right
to public holidays.
• Reasonable right of entry by union
officials.
Almost certainly the Communists will
use the site allowance as the big stick to
beat the employer. Much the same set
of demands, including a high site allow-
ance, is being sought on the Swanbank
(West Moreton, Ipswich) power station
and other projects at the present time.
There is no attempt to discriminate be-
tween the projects situated near towns
and those miles from towns. There is
no real basis for the payment of a high
site allowance at Swanbank or the
Alumina plant (the latter site being
within the precincts of the town of Glad-
stone), even if there was a case for it
at Calcap, about eleven or twelve miles
from Biloela. Even then the site allow-
ance was only £2 with free board and
lodging.
A survey of the principal development
projects to be carried out in the next
year or two in the three main develop-
ment zones shows that much of the work
will be constructional. The building
trades unions, therefore, will hold the
key to progress or disruption.
Because the Communists have a strong
hold on the building trades unions—the
BWIU and the Painters’ Union are
directly controlled by the Communists—
they are in a position to ensure that there
will be more disruption than progress.
Success by the Queensland branch of
the Communist Party in bringing the
Rockhampton, Bundaberg and Mt Mor-
gan Trades and Labor Councils together
with unionists working at Biloela and
Moura into an enormous area committee
headed by the Gladstone Trades and
Labor Council will furnish a central
organisational apparatus through which
the whole campaign of destruction can
be organised.
The question which faces Central
Queensland is therefore whether this
enormous prospect for future develop-
ment is to be hamstrung by a quasi-
military operation.
One of the many questions facing Mr
Calwell is whether or not he is to con-
tinue accepting resolutions of confidence
by the Queensland Central Executive of
the ALP, which is the political front for
the Queensland Trades and Labor Coun-
cil, spearhead of Communist operations
at Mt Isa and Gladstone.
ALP
The Right Wing Deserts NSW
Dump Renshaw and win the Federal Executive
SYDNEY. —NSW is Labor’s last
bastion on the Australian mainland.
While Labor governments have been
wiped out in Victoria, Queensland and
Western Australia as an outcome of the
Labor split, the NSW Labor administra-
tion has held on grimly. But it is run-
ning into something that it has success-
fully evaded for years—the sort of diffi-
culties that have an ideological basis.
Hitherto the NSW Labor Government,
now led by Premier Jack Renshaw
(with Mr Reg Downing, the NSW At-
torney-General, rated as the shrewdest
political operator in the State field as a
capable Grey Eminence), has been kept
in office by prodigious efforts on the
part of Right - wing ALP supporters.
Renshaw and his predecessors as
Premier—the late Mr Joe Cahill and
Mr Bob Heffron—have been able to
secure these prodigious efforts by de-
picting the NSW ALP as the Right-wing
fortress from which ultimately the
Right wing would sally forth to recap-
ture the ALP Federal machine for the
Right-wing cause. The consistent Cahid-
Heffron-Renshaw theme has been: “if
the State Labor Government is over-
thrown, Left-wingers and their Com-
munist-affiliated allies will capture the
NSW ALP machine and that will be
the end of hope for Right-wing recap-
ture of the Federal ALP machine.”
The attitude of the Left wing gave
plausibility to this analysis of the NSW
ideological position in the ALP power
struggle. Many Left-wingers would like
to see the Renshaw Government de-
stroyed. Some of the most trenchant
criticisms of the NSW Labor Govern-
ment are in not what is invariably re-
ferred to in the ALP as “the Capital-
istic Press” but in the journals of Left-
wing unions which are affiliated with
the ALP but which because of their
Leftist orientation do not allow the trifle
of affiliation to inhibit them in expres-
sing their views. These Leftist groups
and organisations accept that part of the
Cahid-Heffron-Renshaw thesis which
claims that, if the NSW Labor Govern-
ment is defeated, the NSW ALP mach-
ine will automatically be taken over by
the Leftists.
But now, at a quite critical moment
with NSW elections imminent, a psy-
chology which has an ideological basis
and which could lead to the NSW Labor
Government’s destruction is developing
among the Right-wingers. These Right-
wingers are questioning the validity of
both prongs of the Cahill-Heffron-Ren-
shaw thesis.
They are asking: (1) Can or will NSW
be used as the springboard for moves
to recapture the ALP machine for the
Right wing while a Labor Government is
in power in NSW?
(2) Does it necessarily follow that if
the Labor Government in NSW falls
that the Left wing will capture control
of the NSW ALP machine?
The -Kennedy incident seems to have
started Right-wingers thinking about
query (1) whether NSW can be used
as a springboard to secure Right-wing
control of the Federal ALP machine,
now under Left-wing control. When
Senator Kennedy, deputy Senate Labor
Leader, made his famous statement at
the declaration of the Victorian Senate
poll advocating a round-table conference
between the ALP and the Democratic
Labor Party, he—inferentially—drew
attention to the ALP’s electoral deficien-
cies mainly due to the existence of a
degree of Communist Party influence
upon a significant and Federally domi-
nant section of the ALP.
npHESE are things about which NSW—■
as well as a sizeable section of the
ALP outside NSW—have been beefing
for years. The Western Australian Par-
liamentary Labor Party Leader, Mr A.
Hawke, came out in support not of
Kennedy’s proposal but of the theme
underlying the Kennedy statement, that
here was a nettle which would have to
be grasped unless Labor was to degen-
erate, in Kennedy’s words, into “a per-
petual Opposition.” Hawke took his
stand even though he knew he was tak-
ing it in opposition to his State ALP
Secretary, Mr F. E. (Joe) Chamberlain,
and probably the WA ALP State
Executive on which Mr Chamberlain is
the major figure. NSW and Mr Ren-
shaw did nothing, leaving Mr Hawke
(who was fighting NSW’s Right-wing
battle) isolated and vulnerable to
attempts by the WA Executive (which
always votes against NSW on any ideo-
logical issue) to cut him down to minute
size.
This has been the pattern throughout
the ideological struggle within the ALP.
Whenever NSW has been presented
with an opportunity to take a stand in
the struggle, it has taken the attitude
that its first task is to protect the NSW
Labor Government, even though this
has meant that its aloofness has enabled
the Left-wingers to eliminate ad pockets
of Right-wing existence in States outside
NSW. Again it is standing aloof from
the struggle leaving the Left wing free to

deal with both Hawke and Kennelly in

Quite a few Right-wingers are begin-
ning to wonder whether there will be
any prospect of Right-wing Federal con-
trol while the existence of a NSW Labor
Government restricts the NSW ALP *o
a purely defensive role which leaves the
Left wing in unchallenged control of the
Federal machine. If these doubts grow
widespread, the NSW Government
could be in real difficulties for it has
been the exertions of its Right-wing sup-
porters that have helped to keep it so
long in power in NSW.
These doubts have led on to further
doubts. If the Renshaw Labor Govern-
ment should fall would that necessarily
mean that the Left wing will capture con-
trol of the NSW ALP machine? Some
Right-wingers are starting to examine
critically the Cahill-Heffron-Renshaw
doctrine that Left-wing control is in-
evitable if the State Labor Government
falls. They are starting to ask whether
the effect of the disappearance of the
last Australian mainland Labor Govern-
ment might not be to shock the ALP
into a really critical examination of
whether it is merely having a period on
the political outer or whether it is head-
ing towards the disintegration of being
a “perpetual Opposition.”
Come of them go so far as to suggest
that not only would the Right wing
keep control of the NSW ALP machine
if the Renshaw Government did fall but
that NSW would be able to fight for
control of the ALP Federal machine
for the first time without inhibitions
and with a chance for success which it
does not have at the moment.
If this kind of thinking spreads, the
Renshaw Labor Government could find
itself in ideological difficulties for the
first time. So far it has been able to
survive by concentrating on preserving
the State Labor Government at the price
of having its own and its supporters’
ideological yearnings thwarted at the
Federal level. But once its supporters
start thinking about the ideological
price they are paying and this seems
to be what is happening they could
lose their enthusiasm for retention of a
State Labor Government.
It is going to be interesting to see
whether these ideological factors which
have proved so decisive in Federal gen-
eral elections and in State elections out-
side NSW are going to develop suf-
ficiently swiftly to become a factor in
the NSW State elections. If they do, the
Renshaw Government could find itself
battling much harder for political sur-
vival than it at present expects.

MEDICINE
Drug Doctors
Ethics and profit
PERTH The West Australian
branch of the Australian Medical As-
sociation has on its hands a large
question of medical ethics that is likely
to have resounding effects throughout
Australia. The State AMA executive
last week was understood to have dis-
cussed the indirect interests of about 20
West Australian doctors in the Mel-
bourne drug company, Virax Ethicals
Pty Ltd. If the executive considered
there had been a breach of ethics their
findings will be referred to the monthly
meeting of the AMA Council this week.
Australia-wide repercussions are likely,
because only a small percentage of the
company’s shareholdings is in the West.
Other States follow the WA pattern of
a large percentage of the shareholders
being women (some of the more fashion-
able names on Perth’s medical register
appear on the register of shareholders—•
through their wives). When this profit-
ethics conflict arose before, many of
the medical men unloaded their shares.
Virax has written to doctors offer-
ing them shares, preferably through
nominee companies or in their wives’
names, to avoid breaching medical
ethics. However, new shareholders have
usually been added through a doctor-to-
doctor approach. In earlier letters to
doctors, Virax suggested that by pre-
scribing the company’s drugs they could
earn themselves a bigger shareholding.
This certainly was an attractive prospect.
Dividends have topped 100 per cent
while last year the profit on issued capital
was about 125 per cent, with a 70 per
cent dividend and at a time when other
drug companies’ stocks were low. Virax’s
issued capital is only £18,475, but last
year this brought in £23,105.
One of the key issues for the AMA
to decide on is whether doctors with
shareholding wives prescribe Virax drugs
in preference to others. A check of
Perth chemists showed that a few did.

MACLEAY STREET, POTT'S POINT, SYDNEY, N.S.W.
Telephone 35.0433. Cables ‘CHEVRON SYDNEY'
should ask the Judge to state a case to
the Court of Criminal Appeal on two
points of law raised in his decision.
Mr G. A. Locke, SM, in Central
Court on September 23 last year, sen-
tenced the editors, Richard Neville and
Richard Walsh, both Sydney students,
to six months’ gaol each for obscenity.
Martin Sharp, the artist, was sentenced
to four months’ gaol, and Oz Publica-
tions Ink Ltd was fined £lOO. Mr Locke
also fined Francis James £5O for having
printed it.
Judge Levine said in his decision last
week that the evidence of literary ex-
perts had established that “Oz” had
literary merit. “In these appeals much
emphasis has been placed upon the im-
portance, purpose and function of satire
as a literary form. Satire is an important
part of the literature of protest dating
back to ancient Rome and Greece. Sati-
rical magazines such as “Oz” have no
doubt been published wherever protest
was thought necessary.
“But while it may be a necessary part
of satire to be critical of human be-
havior by using a wide variety of
weapons, including shock, invective and
even crudity, and techniques from
attack, ridicule, lampooning and carica-
ture to formal confrontation of values,
nevertheless I cannot make it too clear
that obscenity may not be used as a
weapon.
Judge Levine referred to the front
page cover of “Oz” which depicted a
water sculpture constructed into the side
of a prominent Sydney building at which
three youths stood, suggesting they were
urinating into it. A play of words in
relation to the name of this building,
constructed by P & O Shipping Line, was
printed underneath. “The Crown charges
that this cover has a tendency to en-
courage public urination. The sculptor,
Mr T. D. Bass, who gave evidence,
was amused by it, although it pointed
out an aspect he had not envisaged.
This cover in my view is legitimate
satire, not conducive to public urination
and does not constitute an offence under
the Act.
“There follows an article dealing
with marihuana which finally informs
the reader that he could end up in gaol
if he smokes it, a cartoon derogatory of
folk singers has the caption ‘Get folk-
ed\ and an article concerned with the
Prolumo affair contains bawdy and in-
decent words and puns. These and other
articles and cartoons might well appear
to some readers to be offensive, rude,
and in bad taste.
“There remains to consider the
‘Flashed Round The Arms’ article
which is introduced by a paragraph in
formal print advising that the Rev.
Roger Bush had been conducting a
sociological survey of the habits and
morals of young people on Sydney’s

LAW
In Trust
Ruffled calm
SYDNEY— The facade of calm and
unruffled demeanor which normally
characterises the solicitors’ branch of the
legal profession in NSW has been
violently torn aside by the controversy
over interest on trust accounts. In the
last few weeks the Law Society of NSW
has been campaigning for an amend-
ment to the Legal Practitioners Act
which would permit it to obtain interest
on part of trust accounts held by
solicitors and for its use in subsidising
the Solicitors’ Fidelity Guarantee Fund.
However, a group of solicitors, led
by past-president Mr N. L. Cowper
of Allen, Allen and Hemsley, want the
withdrawal of thhse submissions made
to the Attorney-General on the grounds
that two fundamental principles are
infringed. They claim that money held
in trust for clients should not be
diverted from the solicitor’s control with-
out clients’ instructions, and thal income
from clients’ money should not be used
otherwise than for clients’ benefit.
This fund was first set up in NSW
by the 1935 amendment to the Act for
the purpose of reimbursing persons who
might suffer loss through theft or fraudu-
lent misapplication by a solicitor. At
present each solicitor is required to
contribute £6 annually to the fund.

paid out in the case of one solicitor is
£15,000. According to the Society’s
treasurer, the fund stood at £101,505
as at December 31, 1964. Claims notified
or made against the fund, but unsatisfied,
amounted to £167,508. Since January,
1960, claims of £15,468, through the
default of four solicitors, have been
finalised, while all other claims paid
total £6564. The smallness of the amount
actually paid is unquestionably con-
tributed to by the delay and difficulty
caused to claimants by the necessity to
obtain a conviction and to exhaust civil
remedies against the solicitor. For the
same reason, it is impossible to deter-
mine, with any certainty, the solvency
of the fund.
The Society since 1960 has been dis-
cussing various amendments to the Act
with the State Government. Broadly,
the Society wants half of the trust
account held by the solicitor on current
account placed in the bank on a fixed
deposit in the name of the Society as
trustee. The interest earned in this
manner would, claims the Society, avoid
delay in making payments to claimants,
paying them in full, and in building up
the capital of the Fund.
Defenders of the proposed amend-
ments claim that some of the solicitors
leading -the opposition to the amend-
ment of the Act are associated with banks
and that, because of this, their judgment
is not impartial. They claim further that
if the Law Society promotes the intro-
duction of a system which guarantees
complete protection to all people deal-
ing with solicitors at no cost to the
public, then the prestige of the pro-
fession will be greatly enhanced. In the
meantime solicitors in NSW will be
given until March 8 to vote on the
issue and the result will be declared
on March 11.

UNIONS
Left Turn
While the Right wing belly-aches
SYDNEY In no trade-union elec-
tion in Australia was Left-wing ascen-
dancy, Right-wing and moderate dis-
array. and rank-and-file apathy more
evident than in the recently concluded
elections of the Amalgamated Engineer-
ing Union. In a court-controlled ballot
for the important position of Common-
wealth Councillor, the ALP Left-winger
Mr H. Gillman defeated sitting official
Mr J. McDowell by 4780 votes to
3511. Only 8400 of the 21,000 eligible
to vote did so!
It is claimed that McDowell received
his support from the Right wing and the
DLP, while Gillman was the choice of
the Left wing and the Communist Party.
The fact is that the AEU, Australia’s
second largest union, is now completely
in the hands of the Left wing.
That some of its Councillors are ALP
members matters not one whit to the
Communist Party. Their theory, that
they can attain a desired objective by
“sharing the leadership” just as well as
by holding all official positions them-
selves, has been well and truly proven.
They have now reached the second stage,
so succinctly described by L. L. Sharkey
in his “The Trade Unions” when he said:
“. . . the foundation of unity is laid
which will in the end compel the ALP to
agree to the United Front of the politi-
cal parties Communist Party - ALP
united action.”
The rub lies in the fact that only a
year ago the Right wing had control
of the Commonwealth Council of the
AEU and was talking of winning all
positions in the union. However, the
national trend of ineffectualness, schisms
and apathy in the Right wing (and
moderate) forces of the ALP prevailed,
and they were incapable of even holding
what they had.

Death in Isa
Just a lad
MOUNT ISA This once great
mining town was not the best place to
live in last week when a succession of
incidents emphasised the bitterness which
is eating the heart out of the Isa. Prob-
ably the most dramatic and yet tragic
happening was the fatal shooting of a
15-year-old boy, Bernard Alfred Kelly.
He was a student at the Christian
Brothers’ College and later at the Mount
Isa State School. He left school last year
and was unemployed because of the six
months’ dispute which is costing Austra-
lia millions of pounds a week. Then last
week Bernard and his best friend, John
Davis, 14, went swimming. Afterwards
the two lads went to the Davis home in
Station Street where John decided to
show Bernard his father’s .303 rifle.
John was playing with the gun when
it discharged. The bullet ploughed into
Bernard’s right shoulder from the side
of his neck and then out through the
front of his throat. Bleeding from the
terrible wound, Bernard was rushed to
the Mount Isa District Hospital but was
found to be dead on arrival. A simple
tragedy one might say? However, the
shooting would never have happened
but for the dispute. For John’s father
had left the gun loaded in his bedroom
simply because he was afraid that his
family might be threatened or in-
timidated by some of the Isa’s striking
miners.
Among the mourners at the dead boy’s
funeral service in Saint Joseph’s Roman
Catholic Church was Pat Mackie, the
New Zealand-born leader of Mount Isa’s
“rebel” AVVU members. The day follow-
ing the shooting Mackie was the centre
of an incident at the mine smelter gate.
Mackie was standing talking to pickets
when a woman (later identified as Mrs
Davis) emerged from behind cars parked
on the opposite side of the roadway.
She burst through the startled group and
tried to strike Mackie with her hands,
calling at the same time “murderer, they
were the best mates in the world, and
this is how far the troub'e has gone
when a boy is killed”.
Coupled with the boy’s death last
week came a decision by the Australian
Workers’ Union to cease strike aid to the
rebel miners. When the AWU stopped
the aid it had paid out £25,000 to the
miners. The idle miners also were dealt
another body blow last week when the
President of the Queensland Industrial
Court, Mr Justice Hanger, declined to
deal with Pat Mackie’s application for
reinstatement by Mount Isa Mines
Limited while the miners refused to
return to work. He adjourned the
application indefinitely.

The Defence of Asia
Australia's 5000
By T. B. MILLAR
The visit to Australia and New
Guinea of the retiring Chief of the
British Defence Staff, Admiral of
the Fleet Lord Mountbatten, comes at a
time when British-Australian liaison and
partnership is at its highest peace-time
level, and when Australia is making its
greatest peace-time contribution to the
security of a region traditionally regarded
as the responsibility of the United King-
dom.
Nearly 4000 Australian servicemen are
currently stationed in South-East Asia,
and when the Melbourne and its accom-
panying ships reach there in a few
days to take part in Commonwealth
and SEATO exercises, the number will be
more than 5000. The majority are in
Malaysia or on the adjacent waters, and
their present primary concern, because of
the immediate threat from Indonesia, is
with the defence of Malaysia.
Australia's participation in the de-
fence of Malaysia did not of course
start with Indonesian confrontation. For
20 out of the past 24 years we have
had defence forces of various kinds in
Malaya. Their presence has always been
welcome but never more so than today.
Within Australia, the matter has be-
come decreasingly controversial during
the last two years, with the result that
on February 19 last the Labor Party
felt able to issue a statement which
included the sentence: “The action taken
by Australia to assist Malaysia’s defence
up to this point is justified.” “Up to
this point” includes the decision to send
troops to Borneo. Thus on this aspect
of Australia’s defence there is almost a
bi-partisan policy.
It may therefore seem rather strange
that Australia delayed until a few weeks
ago the decision to send troops to the
main combat area in northern Borneo,
and left the ground operations there for
so long to British, Gurkha and Malay-
sian troops.
One could say that the decision was
the latest step in our “graduated
response” to Indonesian aggression, a
response held under tight rein through
a desire to keep lines open to the Indo-
nesian Government.
It could also be that Australia was
prepared to let the others do the fight-
ing so long as they were prepared to
go on doing it, and in this respect Mr
Wilson may indeed have indicated the
tiring of Britain's patience.
Whatever the reasons or the prompt-
ing, Australian ground and air combat
troops are going to Borneo, in rotation
with British units. Unless Indonesian
policy changes, our troops will be in
direct conflict with Indonesian troops
before long.
This must be disturbing to most Aus-
tralians, but it is the clear consequence
of the policy announced by the Prime
Minister in September, 1963, as it is of
the general strategy formulated and
pursued by official Australian defence
thinking since before World War 11. It
would be even more disturbing if we
dishonored our commitments and for-
sook the strategy of forward defence,
thus encouraging the aggressor, disillu-
sioning our friends and allies, and re-
ducing our power of manoeuvre.
On the Prime Minister’s return from
London recently, he spoke of “getting
some order of priority as between Great
Britain, the United States, New Zealand
and ourselves”. The meaning is not
clear, but apparently refers to priorities
in our own commitments. Taking our
battalion out of the 28th Commonwealth
Brigade periodically and sending it to
Borneo means that while it is there it
will not be available for service in
Thailand or Vietnam.
Since we have no other troops ready
for immediate service in the region (ex-
cept perhaps the Special Air Service
Squadron) we have in effect shifted our
first priority from SEATO to Borneo. To
put it another way, we have indicated
to the United States that Indonesia poses
a more direct threat to Australian inter-
ests at this time.
A point arousing considerable public
discussion has been the extent to which
Australian forces in Borneo are covered
by the ANZUS Treaty. The discussion
usually attempts to answer the wrong
question. There is no doubt that, for
the purposes of ANZUS, Borneo is “in
the Pacific”. Sir Garfield Barwick,
then Minister for External Affairs, on
his return from a SEATO Council meet-
ing in Manila in April, 1964, said un-
equivocally that this was the case and
that the United States accepted that
this was the case. His sudden decision
thereafter to accept appointment to the
High Court could be construed (pro-
bably incorrectly) to reflect on the dis-
cretion of his statement, but it does not
reflect on its accuracy. It has never
been disavowed by the Government.
The point at issue really is the situ-


ation or circumstances which in the
opinion of the United States Govern-
ment would warrant its physical inter-
vention.
This has no doubt been the subject
of careful discussion between the two
countries, and obviously neither is going
to reveal the outcome. The world has
become accustomed to quite significant
military operations in circumstances
short of war. The ANZUS Treaty is
not something to be invoked whenever
a soldier or a vessel is fired on, unless
the general situation demands it.
The treaty is concerned with national
dangers, and we can probably expect
the United States to come to our rescue
in an emergency but not to our assist-
ance in a minor action. Yet, what
does a rescue operation mean? It means
the collapse or withdrawal of British
forces, since Australia is contributing
only a small portion of the total combat
strength. While Britain remains, and
remains in strength, the question of in-
voking ANZUS is academic, despite the
political overtones.
The British position in Malaysia is
clearly defined by treaty, administrative
arrangements and through historical de-
velopment. Britain has substantial naval,
military and air forces in the area, with
personnel numbering more than sixty
thousand.
These forces have been predomin-
antly responsible for checking the border
raids in Borneo and mopping up infil-
trators there and in the peninsula. They
provide the retaliatory capacity to strike
Indonesia if Indonesia steps up the scale
of operations. It is not surprising that
their presence is unwelcome to President
Sukarno.
Plow long British forces remain in
South-East Asia is of immense import-
ance to Australia. Grave warnings of
the dangers of maintaining overseas
commitments have been given the Bri-
tish Government by the Governor of
the Bank of England, the leader of the
British Liberal Party, and the London
“Times". The second of these spoke
directly and the third by implication (in
a leader on February 15) of reducing
commitments east of Suez.
Despite its delicate political and eco-
nomic position, the British Govern-
ment has given no indication in the De-
fence White Paper issued last week that
it will heed their advice. Before its
tenuous election victory, the Labor
Party had a foreign policy more Com-
monwealth-oriented than that of the
Conservative Government. It could
hardly dispense with the policy after
the election, especially when the defence
situation in Europe is so much easier,
and when no change in the strength of
the British Army of the Rhine is likely
to affect the adamant French President.
The White Paper mentioned a review
of British Forces in Germany in the
light not only of NATO obligations but
of “the total defence burden and the
nature of the military threats in Europe
and in other parts of the world where
Britain has responsibilities", notably in
areas east of Suez. In other words, the
Rhine army may be reduced to help
Malaysia or SEATO.
To abandon the bases at Singapore
and Aden, while they are still needed
to promote peace in the areas con-
cerned, would be “politically irrespon-
sible and economically wasteful", the
paper said.
The British defence of Malaysia is a
colonial legacy, an emotional involve-
ment, a matter of protecting economic
interests and helping Commonwealth
partners. It is also a matter of prestige.
Understandably Britain has steadily
sought greater participation by Austra-
lia and New Zealand. But while an
Indonesian or Communist threat re-
mains, British forces are likely to re-
main, and it is very much in Australia’s
interest that they should.
Yet we have to remember that the
present British Government exists on
such a slender majority that it may
cease to govern at any time, and the
emphasis of a new Conservative Govern-
men could be different.
The Australian Labor Party’s state-
ment on Malaysia, mentioned earlier,
proposed a four-power guarantee of
Indonesian security and independence
“to relieve Indonesian fears of encircle-
ment". It is hard to see which powers
would constitute, in Indonesian eyes, a
sufficient guarantee.
A simpler and more effective contri-
bution to the peace of the region would
be a one-power guarantee, by Indone-
sia, of the security and independence of
Malaysia. This’ would pave the way for
a diversion of resources in Indonesia
from military spending to domestic
needs, would facilitate the re-introduc-
tion of western economic and technical
aid. and would enable a resumption and
increase of economic, diplomatic and
social contacts between Australia and
Indonesia which are so desirable to and
desired by the peoples of both countries.
South Vietnam
/"|nly a handful of Australians are
serving in South Vietnam. There
are 100 army “advisers", and the air-
crew and maintainence staff for six Cari-
bou light transports. There are also
forces in Malaysia, Thailand and in
Australia which could be made avail-
able.
The contribution is primarily for
political ends. It makes American
policy in South-East Asia a little easier
for the Administration to explain and
justify to Congress, while also (we hope)
assuring the United States that we are
a dependable ally, worth being helped in
turn in an emergency.
It also represents a manifestation of
intent with respect to the SEATO
Treaty. Australia has, after all, under-
taken to “act to meet the common
danger (in South Vietnam, a protocol
state) in accordance with its constitu-
tional processes". Such action requires
the invitation or consent of the South
Vietnamese Government, but this in its
present situation is not a restricting
factor.
We are a signatory to the SEATO
Treaty because we have believed that,
by ensuring a physical American pre-
sence in South-East Asia, we are adding
to our own security.
Militarily speaking, our present and
potential contribution to the defence of
South Vietnam is a very small fraction
of the total non-Communist forces there.
We have supplied a certain amount of
economic aid. These do not entitle us
to a voice in American strategic plan-
ning, nor to criticism of the details of
American day-to-day civil or military
activities.
The United States is as aware as any-
one else that South Vietnam is not
simply a military problem demanding a
military solution. If we are sometimes
concerned at the easily erupting distrust
between the various racial communities
in Malaysia, this is as nothing compared
with the anguish caused to the American
Government by the various groups and
personalities in South Vietnam fighting
for power, prestige or funds -at the ex-
pense of the country’s security and
viability.
The numerous American measures de-
signed to assist economic, social and
political development in South Vietnam
have had little reporting in Australia.
They may not always have been suffici-
ently thought through or wisely imple-
mented. (Which country would have
done better?) But they have largely
failed for a single basic reason: the
systematic campaign of murder and
sabotage by the Vietcong designed to
deny the aid to the South Vietnamese
people.
Many voices are now being raised in
favor of a “political settlement" in
South Vietnam. The war cannot be
won, it is said; the situation is going
from bad to worse with the inexorability
of a Greek tragedy. Better for the
United States to negotiate now while its
position has a certain strength than wait
for its own Dien Bien Phu.
Prominent Americans, in Congress, in
the Press, and within Government de-
partments, favor such an approach. It
is prompted by daring attacks by Viet-
cong against American installations re-
sulting in some loss of life, and despair

tit the possibility of having a stable,
powerful and determined South Vietna-
mese Government.
The prestige of the United States’
Government has suffered in recent
months. Were it to withdraw entirely
from South Vietnam, the whole of
its carefully-fostered and genuinely
deserved reputation in Asia as a bulwark
against Communism and a support
against poverty would be irreparably
damaged.
Who in the region would then feel
safe?
A “political settlement” in South
Vietnam acceptable to the Vietcong
and to the Governments in Hanoi and
Peking could only be one in which there
was a total withdrawal of United
States’ military forces and the way
paved for a Communist government for
the whole of Vietnam.
The present forms of independence in
Laos and Cambodia could not be ex-
pected to last very long thereafter, and
the defence of Thailand would become
considerably more difficult. Thailand
is, of course, Malaysia’s back door.
With the American investment of men
and materials, of confidence and trust,
in South Vietnam —with its great power
and slight losses—it is hard to see how
it could withdraw, or indeed why it
should.
This is not to advocate significantly
widening the war or to propose purely
military measures. It is to suggest that
non-military measures need greater pro-
tection.
Should Australia then be prepared to
increase its military contingent in South
Vietnam, and to send combat units?
The size of our army, even when
National Service training is fully opera-
ting, would not enable a large contribu-
tion, particularly in the light of any
continuing threat to Malaysia or emer-
ging threat to Papua and New Guinea
by Indonesia.
If ground combat troops are to be
employed by more than the United
States, there needs to be a decision
jointly arrived at by that country, South
Vietnam, the United Kingdom, Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, and any other
SEATO member prepared to contribute.
No Simple Solutions
11/here the critics do have a point is in
the wider context of international
diplomacy. The recognition of Com-
munist China by the United States and
her seating at the United Nations could
scarcely have been less productive than
the failure to do or to seriously attempt
these things.
It has long been evident that no inter-
national conference on conventional or
nuclear disarmament could be effective
without Chinese participation, even
though it would not necessarily be effec-
tive with it. And the two Geneva con-
ferences were evidence enough that any
settlement in South-East Asia had a
similar pre-requisite.
If any pride has to be swallowed, let
it be on this issue rather than on with-

The Riviera: End of an Era
Wooing the French tourist
By PATRICIA ROLFE.
who recently returned from a visit to France.
Anyone who watched Sir Winston
Churchill's funeral on television
knew that this was the end of an
era. Churchill had lived through the
end of the British Empire and the end
of a great Britain. But there was an-
other sphere of British influence where
Churchill’s death marked the end of an
age. This was the French Riviera.
Churchill was the last Englishman to
whom to go to the South of France for
the winter, to return to England for the
summer season, and, in time, to return
home to die, seemed the natural order
of things. There are still some English
on the Riviera. Somerset Maugham
frets out his last years but the Promen-
ade des Anglais no longer echoes to the
measured tread of the English taking
their constitutional.
In its great days the Riviera had other
waves of invaders —White Russians,
wealthy Rumanians and Hungarians and
Francophile Americans. But from the
day when an English clergyman saw the
possibilities of Nice and decided this was
the place to live, no one imposed their
way of life, from tea shops and lending
libraries to Anglican churches and gaunt,
gloomy hotels on the area so securely as
the English.
The end of the English era did not
come quickly, of course. The pattern
was changed in the ’twenties and
’thirties when people first began sun-
bathing in numbers and deciding that
they wanted to enter the water as well
as look at it. Then World War II and
subsequent currency restrictions broke
the pattern beyond repair.
Even now the Riviera does not look in
the slightest like a depressed area. In
summer, brown, inert bodies lie elbow
to elbow the length of the narrow
beaches, with considerably fewer people
in the water. There are many more
people of all nationalities, including the
English, visiting the area, but they are
staying a much shorter time and spend-
ing considerably less.
Because there is a summer as well as
a winter season it takes even the most
successful hotel-keeper a much greater
part of the year to earn his living.
M Henri Tschann, the owner of the
recently rebuilt Hotel Splendid in Nice,
said that he needed 2500 guests a year
to get the same sort of return that his
father got from 600. “Then the hotel
was crowded from October to May,”
he said, “and after that we could have
a holiday for the rest of the year. The
guests were mostly English who came
for the whole winter. I was young then
and my chief job was to see that no
one sat in the armchair that some English
colonel thought was reserved for him. I
used to scurry from room to room,
making sure that no Englishman with
his health ruined in India was having a
stroke because someone had taken his
chair. It sounds an easy way to run an
hotel, but actually it was very boring.
By the end of the winter we were
thoroughly sick of our guests and they
were sick of us. It’s much more in-
teresting now. Our guests are more
varied, easier to please. The whole hotel
business here is more stimulating.”
Today’s traveller may be more varied
and easier to please from the hotel-
keeper’s point of view, but he is more
venturesome and capricious. The fact
that he goes to the French Riviera is
his reason for not going the next year.
Travelling Americans have already visited
Europe a couple of times since the war.
They are now looking for something
more off the beaten track —it may be
the Pacific and more likely to impress
their friends at home in subsequent con-
versations. This is true, too, for the
middle-class English, for whom the
Riviera is not as “in” as, say, the Dal-
matian coast or the Costa del Sol. Aus-
tralians, a small but forceful sector of
Europe’s tourist traffic, have never had
any particular interest in the Riviera.
The French Riviera is now flung back
on its initiative. Who can be induced to
come to fill the massive hotels facing
the beaches, to eat in the hundreds of
restaurants, to restore prosperity to the
only major industry the area has known,
the only industry, because of land short-
age and water problems, which is
possible along the beautiful crescent of
coast?
The best prospect seems to be the
French themselves, if they can be dis-
suaded from passing through to cheaper
Spain or gayer Italy. The French
traditionally have been the least ad-
venturous of Europeans. The French
small shopkeeper stood in his doorway
and watched superciliously other people
traipsing through his country. But in
recent years the French, notably the
office workers, with paid holidays, of
overcrowded Paris, which now has a
population of 7,000,000 have taken to
holidaying with a sort of frenzy.
The French now seem prepared to
make almost any sacrifice—even at table
for their annual, or preferably bi-
annual holiday. According to one of the
endless statistical surveys undertaken by
the Ministry of Finance, the French have
now reduced their expenditure on food
and drink from a former handsome 50
per cent to something like 30 per cent.
A proportion has certainly gone on
holidays.
It may be heresy to say it, but it is
hard to believe that the French still eat
well. Those who shop daily in the
markets and cook at home may eat
cheaply and well, but few in Paris can
now go home to their midday meal, still
the main meal of the day. Many offices
have cheap and good canteens for staff,
but those flung on the mercies of the
self-service eat badly and expensively.
The desserts seem to be made of a fairly
inferior brand of detergent. As a
further sign of changing French habits,
the basement of Galeries Fafayette and
Au Printemps, once given over to
batterie de cuisine, now is filled with
electrical gadgets and plastic flowers.
Rises in the price of foodstuffs have
prevented the French from further
economies at table, so they have begun
to spend less on clothes. Textile workers

Artists in a trading company?
Why not? C. Itoh not only sells and buys, but re-designs pro-
ducts to meet the specialized needs of an increasingly com-
plex world market. One of Japan’s oldest and largest interna-
tional trading companies, C. Itoh needs artists and designers
as well as traders, technicians and engineers. C. Itoh fashion
specialists, for example, are among the men who created the
fresh new designs on Japanese textiles that have made it
possible for this industry to export in 1964 more than 35% of
its entire production.
Whether you want to buy or sell from Japan or in any one
of the other 50 countries throughout the world where C. Itoh
branches or affiliates are established or the 100 countries in
which C. Itoh trades, it might be a good idea to get in touch
with an experienced C. Itoh man first. He's probably solved
your trading problem even before you’ve quite found out
what it is, yourself...and if your product needs a new design,
that’s just .another part of his job.

in the north are at the moment the most
depressed section in France. Hours have
been cut to less than 30 per week, while
the Frenchman goes without a new top-
coat. However, he is quite likely later
in the winter to turn round and buy ski
clothes for a snow holiday.
Although the French have taken ro
holidays with enthusiasm they are not
in the main lavish spenders. They want
to know that there are such de luxe places
as the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo or
the faded splendors of the Negresco m
Nice, but they don't want to pay for
them. The French tourist wants to
spend on the scale of Surfers’ Paradise
but still feels he is rubbing shoulders
with the rich, who probably are in the
Bahamas, anyway.
Great contrasts
A certain amount of optimistic re-
building is going on along the Riviera,
but not enough to crumble the Edward-
ian facade. At a village a few miles from
Cannes we found a restaurant installing
a swimming-pool for guests, while 10
yards away a village-woman was wash-
ing her clothes under the cold, running
water of the communal tap. You might
think at first she is paid by the tourist
bureau to stand there and look pic-
turesque, but the fact is that in Europe,
in spite of Common Markets and new
middle-class prosperity, great contrasts
still exist.
While Cannes with” the fading glamor
of the film festival and Nice with its
large contingent of retired people manage
to keep their heads above water, Monte
Carlo continues to flounder. Tourism is
an important industry to France, but it
is Monaco's chief claim to existence.
“Monte” is one place to which the
English still go. Sometimes it seems that
the specimens in the Museum of Oceano-
graphy, established by Prince Albert of
Monaco, may be a little more animated
than those huddled around the tables in
Casino or dancing a foxtrot in the echo-
ing emptiness of vast hotels. The liveliest
place in the principality is probably the
poker machine room at the Casino.
Prince Rainier is fairly aware of his
problems but unable, without help from
Greek millionaire Aristotle Onassis, ro
do much about them. Onassis controls
the Societe des Bains de Mer, the
SBM, which controls much of Monaco.
“But the SBM will not face up to
reality,” Prince Rainier told an English
journalist recently. “The fabulous
gamblers who used to break the bank
don’t exist any more. People have
learned how to gamble. They spend an
hour or so at the tables, then leave
whether they have won or lost.
“The top hotels are all losing money.
The Casino is hopelessly out of date.
Something has to be done quickly, other-
wise Monaco will be finished.”
Prince Rainier will have to tackle his
tourism problems in his own way. The
French certainly take theirs seriously
enough to have asked several parties of
Australian journalists and assorted free-
loaders to visit the Riviera after a direct
air service between France and Australia
was resumed a short time ago.
The French, if their past record is
any criterion, will try to get the best of
both worlds, preserving the appearance
of luxury resorts while providing holi-
days at moderate prices for people who
may be deluded indefinitely into believing
that they are now in a position to enjoy
the rich man’s pleasures.
And what country knows better than
France where no one will admit to
being a Gaullist but where everyone
supports de Gaulle —how to get the
best of both worlds?


Wine, Women and TV
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
Before the Melbourne TV crew
arrived, the Liedertafel Choir,
with its 40 men in bow-ties and
dinner jackets, were singing old Teutonic
folk songs as 1500 people drank and ate
their way through 140 dozen bottles of
wine, countless cheeses, sausages and
specially baked bread, at the Barossa
Valley Festival Weingarten.
The television crew seemed to think
the entire evening had been created for
their benefit alone. They worked their
way along the trestles to the middle of
the crowd. Once the glaring stage-lights
were set up the crew had full control.
Within minutes the crew had the
previously somewhat sombre crowd
swaying, arms interlocked, singing and
clapping, all for a false effect. One of
the stage lights exploded, showering 20
or 30 people with fragments of glass.
Fortunately no one was hurt. But at least
the crew had succeeded in filming the
Weingarten.
The Weingarten the first European
festivity of its kind in this country
could have been a wonderful and unique
evening. The 1500 people sat at long
trestles in front of the sound shell at
the Tanunda Park as members of the
Weingarten Club, a ruse to beat South
Australia’s licensing laws. Membership
tickets, sold at the Government Tourist
Office in Adelaide and at the Festival
offices, allowed the member one bottle
of wine (of his own choice), coffee,
cheese, sour cucumber (a Valley
specialty) and a bucket of ice.
To supplement this the member could
buy varieties of German meats, salami,
garlic sausage, and bread baked in the
Valley that day. The German atmo-
sphere was completed with entertainment
by the Tanunda Leidertafel Choir con-
ducted by Fritz Homburg. The choir,
first formed in the 1860 s, is part of the
Valley’s history itself.
The Barossa Valley Festival, the tenth
held since 1947, followed the traditions
of the great harvest festivals of Europe
a celebration to mark either the begin-
ning or the end of vintage. There were
the traditional grape-picking champion-
ships, an art exhibition, a medieval
tournament with knights (members of
the police force) in fibreglass armor,
reputed to be stronger than the armor
of old, and men with swords and plasfic
maces battling it out on horse and foot,
processions, wine tastings, the Valley
Queen contest and the grape-pressing
championship “medieval fashion”.
Another highlight —at least for the
dedicated wine man was the wine
auction. There for it were a number of
wine connoisseurs from all States in-
cluding Sydney surgeon Max Lake,
author of the recently published book
“The Hunter Valley”, and Mr Joe
Franks, president of the Australasian
Hotel and Catering Institute. Dr Lake,
nursing a broken arm (he fell while
showing students around a hospital), was
gathering material for another book,
“The Classic Wines of Australia”. He
bought a dozen bottles of 1960 Kalima
"Do you believe in reincarnation?“
Cabernet Bin 58 for £9. Just before the
close of the auction he realised he had
already several dozen of this variety so
he resold them and left the auction with-
out a bottle.
Joe Franks got himself what he
described as a bargain six bottles of
1947 Old Oloroso Sherry for 50 shillings.
An American photographer bought £9O
worth of wines and afterwards sidled
over to the national promotion executive
for the industry, Mr Len Evans, and
asked: “Have I bought good wine?”
Altogether 1000 bottles of wine went
under the hammer of Adelaide
auctioneer Mr lan Bruce for £671.
The Barossa Valley, 40 miles north of
Adelaide, 18 miles long and five miles
wide and producing half of Australia’s
wines from its 20.000 acres of vines, is
rich in history. Colonel William Light,
South Australia’s first Surveyor-General
who explored the area in 1837, named
it after Barrossa in Spain where he
fought in the Peninsular War.
Tanunda, Angaston and Nuriootpa
each have populations of about 2000.
The fourth largest town is Lyndoch with
about 700. People of German descent
form a large portion of the population
of these towns. In many cases their
forefathers came to Australia to escape
religious persecution. Some are said io
have migrated to avoid having their sons
conscripted into the German armies.
Yet German names predominate on
war memorials in the Valley listing the
men who fought in the two World Wars.
Even after four and five generations
many of the old German customs sur-
vive, many of the people (particularly
those over 40) are bi-lingual, most names
are German and 50 per cent of the
people are Lutherans.
One Valley identity is Wyndham Hill
Smith, head of S. Smith and Sons who
make Yalu-mba wines. Mr Smith was
only 28 when he took over as head of
the family firm “and they all said I was
too young for the job. But I knew I
could handle it well, and I have,” he
said. “I came into the job by chance.
My brother Syd was killed in an air-
crash in 1938 not long after he had been
managing director when our father
Walter Smith died.
“Syd. Thomas Hardy of Tintara, and
Hugo Gramp, all members of the Aus-
tralian Wine Board, were travelling to
Canberra when the plane crashed at
Kyeema, just outside Melbourne.
Strangely enough Syd was standing in
for Oscar . Seppelt who at the last
moment was unable to make the flight.”
Wyndham Hill Smith was reluctant to
talk money. “Hell, we never see any of
it,” he said. “We’re always borrowing a
quid from the bank. The Hill Smiths
have lived conservatively. I couldn’t
save a penny for 15 years as I was on

a salary of £5OO a year. Naturally every-
thing went back into the business.
Wyndham Hill Smith is president of
the Port Adelaide Racing Club. “Horse
racing is my major sport now,” he said.
‘Tve won 315, no, 316 my horse won
last Saturday races in the 30 years
I’ve been connected with racing. .Owned
about 130 horses, too.” As a young
man he played against the MCC in
Western Australia. “I still like to drop
in on a game now and then. Only as a
spectator, you understand.” Wyndham
Hill Smith admits, however, that the
hobby that takes up considerable time is
wine tasting. “I really enjoy these. Al-
ways try to manage three a week. You've
got to keep the old palate in, you know.”
The Smiths have been -associated with
the Valley since 1849. Mr Smith said
the founder of Yalumba was a brewer at
Wareham, England, who resigned when
the owner announced the brewery would
operate on Sundays. He came to Aus-
tralia and started a vineyard at Angas-
ton in 1849 after arriving there in a
bullock cart with his wife and four
children. The going was hard financially
and in 1852 he joined the goldrush to
Victoria. After initial frustrations he
struck it rich and used this to develop
his winemaking venture.
From a beer district
Valley pioneer, Joseph Ernst
Seppelt, in patriarchal fashion, took
13 families and a group of young men
from the factory where he had produced
tobacco, snuff and liqueurs in Silesia,
Germany, with him to the Valley in
1849. At the site of the present Seppelts-
field they first planted a plot of tobacco
which grew prolificallv though the leaf
was found too rank for use as tobacco
or snuff. So Seppelt turned instead to
viticulture.
Johann Gramp, the founder of
Orlando, was for a time assistant to
South Australia’s first Surveyor-General,
Colonel William Light. Gramp planted
vines in 1847 in the southern part of the
Valley. He is credited with having
planted the first vines in Barossa. Johann
Gramp came from Kulmbach, Bavaria,
a place noted for its beer. Yet another
early name in the Valley is Hoffman.
Johann Samuel Hoffman, who at the
age of 20 fought at the Battle of Water-
loo, started winemaking in 1868 at
Tanunda where he had settled 21 years
earlier.
This then is the Valley, the people
and their festival. The festival was a
subtle mingling of the past with the
present, the traditional and the experi-
mental, the old and the new. Only I
hope that when the next Festival comes
around in two years television won’t be
there with its particular brand of the
new.


Larger Than “Life”
A fetish of being controversial
By CHARLES HIGHAM
dWT E sell 400,000 copies more than
‘Life’ Magazine.” Looking
down at Sydney from the 13th
floor Colonial Suite of the Chevron
Hilton, Gardner Cowles, “Look’s” chair-
man and editor-in-chief, beamed with
calm, appropriate pride. Now in his
early sixties, Cowles is —in his old-
fashioned three-piece grey suit and
golden watch-chain a charming, slow-
speaking elder statesman of the magazine
business who has watched his glossy
brain-child grow handsomely from a
million to 7,500,000 in the 28 years
of its.existence.
How big was the staff? “We have
around 5500 people working for us.
About 1000 in New York and another
1000 in subscription and circulation,
which are handled from Des Moines,
lowa, the central point of our operation.
And the rest are all over.
“We have an editorial staff, including
photographers and layout men, of 200.
And then there are Washington and Los
Angeles bureaux. We like to hire our
people at the age of 30 after five years
or so of experience in book publishing
or newspapers. We take about four a
year from the universities —bright young
boys or girls. We put them for a couple
of years in editorial research, preparing
background for stories. We graduate
people from research and put them out
on story assignments. Some editors tend
to become specialists in different fields —
one might be an expert on armaments or
on the space effort.
“We send a writer and a photographer
out together on an assignment. When
they return they will work with others
editors —on rewrites. ‘Life’ rewrites
almost every word it receives, but we
don't go that far. We just like to discuss
and make certain changes.”
“Look,” Mr Cowles said, had
developed from a rotogravure section
which he had introduced in the ’thirties
into his family paper, the “Des Moines
Register and Tribune.” He began experi-
menting with telling stories in pictures
and found that the technique drove
circulation up by 100,000 copies. “I
took ‘Look’s’ dummy to New York and
showed it to Harry Luce. He showed
me the dummies for ‘Life’. He was
ready to go ser we let him publish ‘Life’
first to gauge the response. ‘Life’ came
out in September, 1936. ‘Look’ came
out four months later. We didn’t do
much promotion, just put ‘Look’ straight
out on the stands, it went up to a
million straight away.
“We are, of course, in competition
with ‘Life’. But the difference is we
make no attempt to cover spot news.
‘Life’ does that and always has the
problem of being late with news that
everybody has read already.
“They also have the problem of their
international edition, which has given
them a good deal of trouble. We feel
that the costs of photographic printing
all over the world fail to justify the
international distribution. And we have
always concentrated on the domestic
readership almost exclusively.
What was the “Look” formula? “We
make a fetish of being controversial. We
try to seize on subjects which are going
to be interesting for several weeks, not
just for a few days. We have crusaded
on birth control, on the civil rights issue,
and on free medical care for the aged.
Our birth control campaign was criticised
by the Catholics, and after our Negro
campaign many people in the South
cancelled their subscriptions, but we
more than made up for that in the North.
On medicine we have taken the attitude
that everybody is entitled to adequate
medical and hospital care regardless of
what they are earning. This has been
violently disputed by the American
Medical Association. But we believe
there will finally be something in
America as good as your own system of
medicine where the patient can be pro-
tected at least partly against the
enormous costs of illness.” Voluntary in-
surance, Mr Cowles said, had been
growing and now about 50 per cent of
American families had hospital and
medical benefits.
“Look’s” stories —on medicine, educa-
tion, birth control and other pressing
issues—were thoroughly researched by
a large staff. The writer was then pre-
sented with a dossier or memorandum,
and he had to shape the story around a
single personality, a struggling doctor,
a figure in the Negro battle, and so on.
“We don’t believe famous authors’
names sell a magazine. It’s the man they
are writing abouC that counts. Peppie
like to read about people. I’ll give you
an example. The ‘Post’ paid an enormous
sum to Eisenhower to do six articles a
year for them. He didn’t have much to
say and his name made no difference to
circulation.”
The “Post”, Mr Cowles said, was
probably doomed; it was losing “a great
deal of money”. . .“The Curtis Publishing
Company, which runs it, failed to mod-
ernise its printing plant, it failed to
modernise its paper mills and it failed
to modernise its editorial formula. The
same thing happened to ‘Colliers’, which
I bought a few years back and incorpor-
ated into ‘Look’. We, ourselves, have
very gradually changed with the times.
We are still very highly illustrated but we
treat subjects more thoroughly now'.
There’s been a great broadening of the
mass public taste and we have to bear
that in mind. The impact of World War
11, the Korean War and the Space Effort
and now the great new emphasis on
adult education have changed the
audience’s outlook.
“Fiction used to be one of the main
features of the ‘Post’ -and ‘Colliers’. But
TV has absorbed that audience it’s
easier to watch a story than read it. Wc
can’t just do a fan-type story on a star
nowadays. It has to have some very
special angle. And TV personalities only
last a few months so we have to bear
that in mind, too. ‘Reader’s Digest’, of
course, is always hopeful, always happy,
with happy endings to every story. But
the appeal there is to older people if
you take the total readership . . . yes,
they give reassurance . . . but we like
to shake people up.”
With issues planned months ahead,
W'asn’t there a problem of being caught
on the hop when events changed the
facts in an article? “There was one
occasion when President Kennedy was
assassinated and we came out the follow-
ing week with a story about the dif-
ficulties facing him at the next election.
But that doesn't happen every day,” Mr
Cowles concluded with relief.

Making History at
Waterloo
By PATRICIA ROLFE
IF one day in ’l9lB the young Carl
Dolmetsch had not left a suitcase on
No. 7 platform, Waterloo Station,
London, millions of children throughout
the world today would not be playing
that lively, but not in the initial stages
entirely pleasing, musical instrument, the
recorder.
But that is Dr Dolmetsch's view of
his part in an accident-of history. Dr
Dolmetsch, now the world's most dis-
tinguished player of the recorder and a
noted player of other instruments of the
17th and 18th century, is paying his
first visit to Australia. With his accom-
panist, Mr Joseph Saxby, he is giving
recitals for the Arco management.
The suitcase which young Carl left at
Waterloo belonged to his father, the
famed Arnold Dol-
metsch. It con-
tained an antique
recorder which Ar-
nold Dolmetsch,
who had already
brought renewed
life to instruments
of the harpsichord
and viol families,
had bought some
years before at an
auction of the be-
longings of Charles
Taphouse, who had
owned a music shop
in Oxford.
It was the first
recorder Arnold
Dolmetsch had
owned, although not
the first he had
seen. A tutor,
dating from the
18th century, went
with the auction
purchase and from
this Arnold Dolmetsch learnt to play the
antique recorder. This new sound was
then added to the already flourishing
Dolmetsch Consort.
“But if I had not lost my father’s
bag he may never have set about learn-
ing how to make a recorder,” Dr Dol-
metsch said. “He did that in four
months, although even he, with his ex-
perience of musical instruments, dis-
covered then that the recorder, which
seems so simple, is a much more intri-
cate and subtle instrument than, say,
the flute7’
The lost recorder was later bought in
a junk shop for ss. by a friend of the
Dolmetsch family, who returned it to
Arnold Dolmetsch, accepting one of the
new-ones in return.
Arnold Dolmetsch's first recorder
was the precursor of the 4000 recorders
a week turned out today by the Dol-
metsch company in Haslemere, Surrey.
The company also makes harpsichords,
clavichords, viols and lutes, but these do
not warrant the mass production which
the popularity of the recorder calls for.
Dr Dolmetsch is the managing director
of the Arnold Dolmetsch Company and
also the director of the annual festival
at Haslemere.
“I have a wonderful team of people
to help me,” he said, “but at the same
time all this business activity prevents
my being able to act like a temperamen-
tal recitalist. Resting for half a day be-
fore a performance
and so on. I travel
about six months of
-the year, but I can
never stop off for
a week anywhere
for a holiday. While
I am here I am still
working on details
for this year’s festi-
val in Haslemere.”
But it is obvious
that Dr Dolmetsch
was raised in a
pretty rigorous
school. He speaks
with affection and
admiration of his
father, but still
makes him sound
a fairly awe-inspir-
ing character. He
was certainly the
man responsible for
the fact that today
Dr Dolmetsch plays
22—“ or 23, I’m not sure”—musical
instruments.
The position in the Dolmetsch family
was that Papa would get a new en-
thusiasm, or discover a new instrument
or piece of music, then look around the
living-room. Whichever child of the two
boys and two girls was nearest to hand
would be handed the new instrument or
score and told to begin work.
“I used to be very reluctant at the
time,” Dr Dolmetsch said, “particularly
when music took me away from other
things I loved, such as natural history,
but I’m grateful now.”
Dr Dolmetsch began learning the viol
when he was four. He was consigned to

the treble recorder in 1919 and by 1925
was playing other members of the re-
corder family. This led to his giving the
first solo recorder recital at the Wig-
more Hall in 1939. But in the mean-
time he had been set to learn the violin
for Handel recitals and the lute when
Sir Thomas Beecham wanted to include
the “Ode for St Cecilia's Day” in a
programme.
Although the Dolmetsch family has
long since survived the jibe of “mere
antiquarianism” at their revival of in-
struments of the 17th and 18th cen-
tury, for Dr Dolmetsch the gap between
that period and the 20th century is
easily bridged.
“The first musical Dolmetsch was a
contemporary of Johann Sebastian
Bach,” he said. “That is one link. But
if you look at it another w'ay, it is 107
years since my father's birth. And my
father knew many pupils of Beethoven.
My father also studied the violin in
Brussels under Vieuxtemps, who was a
protege of Paganini.
“Then my great-great-grandfather
taught all his children to play Bach on
the clavichord. And I remember once
when I was a child my great-aunt
came to the house we were living in at
Dulwich, in London, and played Bach
on a new clavichord made by my
father. So you see there are links all
the time.”
Dr Dolmetsch said that although the
major work of rediscovery was done by
his father, “even such a man as he
could not do everything in his lifetime.”
More and more music was being found
in England and on the Continent which
established new reputations for old com-
posers and put others into fresh per-
spective. Also at Haslemere minor im-
provements were constantly being made
in the manufacture of musical instru-
ments.
“The chief example of change is, of
course, the plastic recorder,” Dr Dol-
metsch said. “Because a recorder is
mainly a column of sound, a good plas-
tic one is better than a poor wooden
one. The main thing about the old in-
struments is to understand how to play
them correctly. Musicians used to pick
antique recorders out of museums, play
them as you would an oboe and flute
or say, ‘how terrible'! As if our ances-
tors, who lived in a much more noise-
free age and whose ears were more
sensitive than ours, would have been
tone-deaf.”
Dr Dolmetsch believes that with right
guidance most people can learn to
appreciate music. However, he admitted
that the wonderful musical history of
the Dolmetsch family was not being
carried forward intact into the next gen-
eration. “One of my nephews works in
radar for Decca,” he said, ‘’and the
other is an income tax official.”

The Day of the Herefords
Red Tickets for South Boorook’s Hoi Polloi
TTnquestionably, one of the nicest
days of the year in the Western Dis-
trict is the South Boorook annual Here-
ford sale, on the property, just out of
Mortlake. Mr Jim Allen, the sole pro-
prietor, claims it as the biggest annual
stud cattle sale in the country. Indeed,
it is the only sale we know about where
one needs a ticket to get in. And get-
ting into the South Boorook sale is like
getting tickets for “Camelot”, “My Fair
Lady” or some such. The tickets have
various gradings, white for the sure
buyer, blue for the right type of looker-
on, red for the hoi polloi.
Anyway, it is rather essential for one
to be seen at the South Boorook sale.
Last week all the finest pedigree lines
of the Western District were there, Fair-
bairns, Manifolds, Chirnsides, Austins,
Baillieus . . . Just by the homestead
was the car park with a fine sprinking
of Rolls-Royces, Jaguars, Rovers and
Mercedes. A little further over was
the South Boorook airfield with a two-
way 3000-foot airstrip. Here was a nice
line-up of Cessnas and the occasional
Beechcraft Bonanza. Cattlemen had
flown in from four States, including the
Northern Territory. Miss Sue Allen
was there in a Mark X Jaguar to run
a shuttle service across the 400 yards
from Cessna to sale ring. The sale has
been operating now for 10 years and
every year it has been refined, until now
it is a real lesson in sophisticated cattle
selling techniques. The whole place is
wired throughout for sound and during
the day there is sweet piped music to
put buyers in a gentle frame of mind.
The sale ring is in a galvanised iron barn
which seats 2000 in proper chairs, tiered
as at a prize fight. It is four times the
size of the sale ring in Sydney. And
to give everything a balmy comfort
there is a special water spray system.
As soon as the temperature goes up,
water sprays on the roof.
What’s more there is a tape recorder
with a technician on hand who records
the whole proceedings. This has several
advantages. When a buyer insists that
he never bid more than 950 guineas
for a bull, they can play it all back and
show that his bid was 1000. Or they
use it to play back some of the great
record bids, like 4100 guineas last year
for a cow and calf. They make purer
music than any pop records on the local
radio station. Yes. last week the show-
manship was really something, and it
took a staff of 95 to turn it on. It all
started at 10 a.m. You must understand
this was not just a sale but a “cattle
fair”. Outside the sale room there was
a gorgeous stretch of turf, as well trim-
med as the MCG, chairs all around.
Mr Allen had brought in a top Here-
ford judge, Mr Keith Hawkins, to judge
them and award them South Boorook
ribbons. Mr Allen, of course, could
only win all the prizes, but it built up
interest.
Each bull had his attendant in a beau-
tifully starched white jacket with SB on
the lapel and each beast was so nicely
washed and polished it all reminded one
of a crocodile on the way to church.
At South Boorook they have a special
machine called an “electro-groom” im-
ported from the US at a cost of £350.
It goes over them like a great vacuum
cleaner.
The sale started at 1.30 p.m. Over
the auctioneers’ heads, Messrs Bob For-
syth and Alf McGeogh, there were
hundreds of Royal Show ribbons taste-
fully made into blankets. To the left
were framed color photographs of dis-
tinguished old boys, South Boorook Vern
Milton and South Boorook Brimful. Bid-
ding never started at under 200 guineas,
the average price for females was 561
guineas and the average price for bulls
458 guineas. Bob Forsyth had a high-
pressure, non-stop, machine-gun style.
Alf McGeogh was a little more flam-
boyant. He had a “Hamlet” air of
tragedy about him, a look of permanent
injury that buyers should insult such
quality Hereford cattle by offering at
any time less than 2000 guineas. One
time he tried to start off the bidding at
1700 guineas. When it had shrunk to
a third of that price Jim Allen said: “1
thought you were opening your mouth a
bit big for a beast of that quality.”
“Ohhhhhh, Mr Allen,” said Alf
McGeogh, “would you have taken the
money if I had got it.” Top price for
a bull was 1600 guineas and top price
for a cow 2000 guineas. The best bid-
ding was for Lot 39, a fine young
gentleman of 17 months, South Boorook
Cadell. Jim Allen remarked: “That’s
the best bull I have offered.” The bid-
ding went all the way to 3300 guineas
and that was the stage, I think, when
they began to cool off the building with
water. However, the money wasn't
good enough. The reserve price was
5000 guineas.
The 77 lots brought 31,675 guineas—
not a memorable year. The total for
1964 was 41,000 guineas. But Jim Allen
said it was all satisfactory as far as he
was concerned. There was less money
around this year, and one couldn’t ex-
pect better prices. But one wondered
if things would ever be quite the same
again. This was to be the last South
Boorook sale in guineas. Next year it
would be in dollars. It was all over
just after 3.30 p.m. and the 2000 red,
blue and white tickets adjourned to the
Hereford tent, a large marquee on the
lawn. Here Mr Allen already had pro-
vided free lunch and free afternoon tea.
Now it was time for free drinks. There
were 10 eighteen-gallon kegs of beer,
cases of Vat 69, cases of White Horse,
gin and tonic and the party was on until
at least eight or nine o'clock. The only
unhappy people were the charter pilots
who were sticking carefully to their
cups of tea and one or two sad-eyed
looking Herefords, who maybe didn't
want to leave South Boorook.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN
“China Shook Us Up”
In Canberra last week Sam Lipski asked India’s retiring High Com-
missioner to Australia, Mr B. K. Massand: Is China still a threat?
Can India and Pakistan solve their disputes? Do the language riots in
Southern India threaten the country’s unity? Have Australian attitudes
to India changed?
1%/TR MASSAND, Pakistan claims that
one of the reasons you were un-
prepared when the Chinese attacked was
that your crack troops were on the
Pakistan border.
That is fantastic. The nature of the
terrain on the two frontiers is very dif-
ferent and the troops and equipment in
one section are not interchangeable.
Why then does Pakistan fear attack?
I see no basis for this fear. If they
were really genuine in their fears then
why have they not accepted our offer
of a no-war pact which would mean
there would never be war between the
two countries. If the differences between
us are ever to be settled,'then there must
be trust —we must establish the right
kind of atmosphere.
If the problem of Kashmir could be
solved would this help?
Kashmir is only one of the problems.
Is it not THE problem?
There are many problems and an
attempt has to be made to solve them.
We in India want peace and would like
Pakistan to feel likewise. If we get the
right response, which means a willingness
to recognise our desire for peace, then
we should be able to solve all the
problems.
How has Pakistan’s moving closer to
China affected relations between you?
\ We do not regard it as an act of
friendship towards India. But I repeat
I do not think that there is any re-
sponsible group of opinion in India
which wishes ill to Pakistan. We want
a good neighbor and it is equally impor-
tant for Pakistan to have a good neighbor
in India. Closer co-operation would mean
benefits for both countries. Don’t for-
get that before partition the economies
of the two areas were complementary.
One had the natural resources which
the other did not have. We are facing
such great problems of food and pro-
ductivity in India. With our efforts to
raise our standards of living, would it
really be in our interests to engage in
useless strife with Pakistan? But on the
other hand Pakistan’s foreign policy
appears to revolve around India. The
anti-India attitude was used by many
of the Pakistan parties in the presidential
election campaign and their representa-
tives in the United Nations repeat the
vitriolic attacks on us regularly.
Pakistan is unhappy because we are
getting arms from the US. But how
many millions of dollars worth of arms
have they got from the US and for what
purpose?
What is India’s defence preparedness
like today?
China continues to be a threat, build-
ing up her troop strength on the Indo-
B. K. MASSAND
Chinese border, making new roads and
airfields, but we are today much more
ready to meet a threat from the north
than in 1962. We hardly had any troops
then equipped to fight in those difficult
high altitudes, but the Chinese attack
shook everybody up.
How do you see India’s role in inter-
national affairs today? Do you still think
you can provide a neutralist solution to
problems?
We were never neutralist but non-
aligned.
I accept your distinction but has it
been a tenable policy since China’s
attack?
If anything the Chinese attack has
more than justified the policy of non-
alignment.
I am not certain I follow that.
Well, the basis of the policy of non-
alignment has always been that it is a
policy which is best suited to India’s
national interest and in taking no sides
as between the East and the West on
international issues. If we had not fol-
lowed such a policy, then the > Chinese
attack would not have brought forth
sympathy and assistance from both the
East and the West.
In reading of the latest language riots
in Southern India it sometimes seems as
if there are so many internal divisions
and differences in India that there can
never be full stability. Do you share the
despair expressed by some over this?
You should remember that we are
only 17 years old—not a very long time
really. There are so many problems in
such a vast country and they are very
complicated. It is true that what hap-
pened in the last few weeks was quite
serious, but it does not prove that India
suffers from lack of unity. The greatest
proof of that was when China attacked.
Everyone got together in the most
significant show of unity.
Your Prime Minister, Mr Shastri, did
stress that the riots threatened national
unity.
The agitation against the introduction
of Hindi as the official language has been
organised by a vocal minority. What
has happened arose over a misunder-
standing of the intentions of the Govern-
ment. In practice the latest decision does
not make the slightest difference. Those
who have been using English are still
free to do so.
This rioting is basically due to a
minority in Madras. While a minority
has its rights, it cannot dictate to the
majority. No one wants to go against
the legitimate interests of the minority,
and now that they have been assured of
the Government’s real intentions, they
apparently feel satisfied about the
future and I have no doubt that the
agitation will die a natural death.
In view of what has happened, don’t
you think you may be excessively
optimistic?
No, not at all. Two Ministers resigned
over the issue but rejoined the Govern-
ment when the misunderstanding was
cleared up.
Another internal difference which we
assume threatens India’s progress is the
caste system. What effect does this have
today?
It no longer applies to the present
conditions. Our Constitution does not
recognise any caste as such nor does
it recognise any religious differences.


Surely you would agree that what the
Constitution says may not apply prac-
tically?
Yes, there are some deep - rooted
differences but they no longer have any
significant effect.
But how is India dealing with the
problem facing her agriculture when so
many of the peasants are “Untouchables”
without any of the drive or energy or
education of the other classes.
This no longer applies. In our agri-
cultural institutions we have students
from all castes.
How has the current five-year plan
worked out?
We have achieved some significant
results and have reached our targets in
many directions. But there was some
failure to reach the targets; for example,
in food production because of a series
of bad seasons and droughts. This should
improve soon.
Do you think Australia has some
special role in Asia?
I don’t see why not.
Can you formalise it?
Australia’s role will, of course, depend
on the situations as they arise, but there
is a long-term role that Australia can
play because she is technically and
materially the most advanced nation in
the region and so cannot escape playing
a leading part.
You are leaving to become ambassador
to Chile, Peru and Colombia. What has
struck you most while you have been
here?
I’ve enjoyed the wonderful hospitality
and informality and I do hope that Aus-
tralia’s expansion will continue. My time
here has seen a growing closeness be-
tween our two countries and I feel that
this tendency has come to stay.
“A Cause to Die For”
Saw Lipski asked Pakistan’s High Commissioner, Mr K. M. Kaiser:
Why is Pakistan moving closer to China? Why does Pakistan fear
India? What can Australia do in Asia?
IY/|R KAISER, why is Pakistan moving
closer to China?
We are in the process of normalising
our relations with Peking. We have
recognised China at the same time as
Britain, there has been an exchange' of
visits between leaders. Since 1959, and
with the full knowledge of our SEATO
allies, we have settled the demarcation
line on the border with China and in
doing so we have defused a potentially
explosive situation. After all, we live
next to China and have to live with her.
Do you think that there Is any con-
tradiction in your close relations with
China and your military support from
the United States?
There is no inherent contradiction.
Do you see China as an expansion-
ary aggressive force in Asia?
China is so full of its own problems
of development even the Sino-Indian
business was only a border dispute
that from our point of view we do not
necessarily regard her as a danger.
China has never given Pakistan any
reason for fearing her.
Another country on your border,
Tibet, was invaded and taken over by
China. Doesn’t this concern you?
On Tibet we take the same view as
Britain that it is part of China.
What do j'ou think the Chinese mean
when they advocate world revolution?
The danger of revolution lies in sub-
version from within. This comes from
K. M. KAISER
a lack of ideals, a lack of causes for
which people are prepared to die, and
economic degeneration which brings dis-
content and hunger. In Pakistan we
have created conditions of stability, we
have introduced social reform and we
have our cause. The Communist Party
is banned in Pakistan, it is a dirty word
in all the villages, and there has never
been a Communist in any of our Parlia-
ments.
What are Pakistanis prepared to die
for?
The preservation of our heritage, of
our way of life, our freedom. Remem-
ber that half a million of us were killed
in the establishment of the nation. Now
we are riding on the crest of a wave
of confidence. We have just had a
Presidential election and the justice of
our policies is proving itself in both
social and economic spheres.
Considering Pakistan’s past problems
do you think that President Khan may
be handing back power to the non-
military groups too early?
It is to the greatness of the man that
he has confidence that democracy will
work. We have evolved our own form
of democracy because we believe it is
not for the forms which keep democracy
alive but the ideas and the spirit. The
most important thing is the rule of law
and that we have never abandoned.
In March we have our elections for
the National Assembly and it will have
the important task of being custodian of
our next five-year plan. We over-fulfilled
our last one.
Our growth rate is 7 per cent per
annum, 5 per cent more than our growth
of population. Our standard of living is
going up, but of course it is still far
behind a country like yours. You know
I sit here and ask myself about the
destiny of our people and our problems.
That coffee cup you’re drinking from
probably cost my government three
guineas >— and. the average income per
year is £4O in your country it is about
£lOOO.
Can Australia do anything about this?
You know, the winds of change are
very apparent here. The thing that hits
you in the eye is the large number of
Asian students, and the growing interest
in public and press circles. But you
could do more to help Asia stand on its
feet economically. It goes beyond aid to
more trade and more investments. This
can't come from a government order. It
has to be a realisation on the part of
industry and commerce of the whole
country.
Mr Kaiser, compared with the in-
terest which is shown in many circles in
Australia towards India, Pakistan seems
somewhat remote. Why is this so?
I don’t altogether agree with that.
There is the historical association which
many of your troops had with what
used to be the Indian Army the
majority of which were Pakistanis.
There is our common membership of
SEATO. We have a strong rapport at
the United Nations and in the assess-
ment of international problems. Interest
is growing generally.
Why has President Khan been so
critical of American arms supplies to
India?
We feel that the Chinese neither have
the capacity nor the intention to invade
India, to sweep down the Himalayas
for a full-scale invasion. The logistics of
it all are against it. That assessment is

President Khan’s and he is no layman
in these things. So we are doubtful
about India’s assurances that she will
use the arms only against the Chinese.
We want to know how anyone is going
to go keep a check of that. Some of
these arms have already appeared in
Kashmir. President Khan is quite justi-
fied in expressing his fear of Indian
aggression.
Why do you fear it?
You are asking for an explanation
which goes back into history. We have
lived with the Indians for thousands
of years. We have their record their
seizure of Kashmir is only one example.
Some may be enamored of all this talk
about non-violence and passive resis-
tance but what about Hyderabad and
all the others and the latest example
in Goa as well as their daily violations
of the cease-fire in Kashmir. This has
been going on for years and all to no
purpose. After all, what does independ-
ence mean for either of us if we cannot
consolidate independence? Why do we
have to live in fear of one another?
Well, why do you?
The United Nations proposals for
solving the Kashmir dispute have been
rejected by India on some 15 occasions.
It is a matter of State policy in Pakis-
tan that all disputes should be settled by
conciliation, by mediation or by arbitra-
tion. India regards any such proposals
as an infringement of her sovereignty.
The whole thing is suicidal and unneces-
sary. Both of us would benefit in such
things as irrigation. We, for instance,
have enough natural gas to last us for
400 years. The Indians are hungry for
that sort of power. It would be enor-
mously helpful for them. But then we
come back to Kashmir and neither of
us trusts each other.
Why would it be in India’s interests
to attack you?
1 do not say it is in her interests. But
•it could happen because they would
slip into it or because of her internal
tensions. Caste is still the big factor
dividing Indian society and holding her
back. Don’t forget that there are mil-
lions in India who do not believe that
Pakistan has a right to exist and have
never given any sign that they will con-
cede it. They are not powerless. The
only way to get around all this is to
establish some atmosphere where we
could make some progress.
What do you think of the view that
Pakistan needs to use India as a psycho-
logical scapegoat for internal problems
and as a way of unifying the people
working in some ways as the Chinese
threat now works for the Indians?
That’s definitely wrong. Have I be-
trayed anything like that view in talking
to you? There is just no need for that
bankruptcy of approach or lack of
statesmanship. We have recently helped
India, for instance, with the sale of
100,000 tons of rice on the most favor-
able terms. Does that sound like the
kind of thing you mentioned?
Now Kashmir is a case of what the
people there, not only in Pakistan, think
themselves. And things are getting worse,
not better. Public resentment is grow-
ing.
India claims that this is because your
Government is fomenting rebellion with
anti-Indian broadcasts.
Ask the Indians if the people of Kash-
mir can listen to Radio Pakistan. What
is liberty worth if ministers can be gaol-
ed? You just can’t go on keeping four
million people down.
Are you at all hopeful about future
relations with India or do the differences
go too deep?
The differences are in some ways very
deep. It is true that they play in the
minds of men and that they have deep
roots in history but certainly we
could co-exist together.

When Is a Jew
Not a Jew?
When he’s an Israeli
FROM A CORRESPONDENT
/"Outside Israel, and especially in the
United States, playing “Who is a
Jew?” has become the favorite game of
Jewish magazine editors stuck for a
symposium idea. Writers, aspirant
Ph.Ds, and jazz critics struggle with the
answer, speaking of “alienation”, “iden-
tity-crisis”, “schizophrenic loyalties” and
“folk-angst”.
The answers will not make any differ-
ence to the rights and privileges of other
Jews. In Israel, on the other hand, it
matters very much what answer you give
to the question “Who is a Jew?”, as the
latest case of Mrs Rina Eitani shows
The daughter of a Polish Jew, who had
been killed by the Nazis in the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising, Mrs Eitani, 35, came
to Palestine as a refugee in 1947, mar-
ried in an orthodox religious ceremony,
served in the Israeli army, was a mem-
ber of a border kibbutz, and is now a
town councillor of the Mapai (Labor)
Party in the new town of Upper Nazar-
eth —built by the Ministry of Housing
near the historic town of Nazareth.
Yet, because her mother, a German
Protestant, had never been converted, the
Jewish religious law does not regard her
as Jewish and the Ministry of the In-
terior has asked her to return her pass-
port. She can now apply for the issue
of a new one, either after formally be-
ing converted to Judaism or as a natura-
lised non-Jewish Israeli citizen which she
is automatically, having arrived in the
country before the establishment of the
State in 1948.
The issue has become another cause
celebre in the continuing battle between
the secular and the religious in Israel,
made more complex because of the
political, legal and constitutional issues
which are quite interwoven.
On the face of it the problem arose
because of the laws which apply only to
Jews. Among these is the basic Law of
Return passed in 1950 under which
every Jew has the right to come to Israel
as an immigrant, and the Nationality
Law passed a year later under which
every Jewish immigrant automatically
becomes an Israeli citizen, unless he
contracts out of this automatic imposi-
tion. In such cases he can acquire
Israeli nationality in the same way as
non-Jews by becoming naturalised in the
normal manner. Another law provides
for the issue of identity cards which in-
dicate the holder’s “nationality, ethnic
group and religion”.
The Ministry of the Interior has de-
manded the return of Mrs Eitani’s pass-

port on the grounds that she is not
Jewish and therefore is not entitled to
the automatic citizenship under the Law
of Return. She has also lost her pri-
vileges of citizenship because, while auto-
matically eligible as a non-Jewess, she
has not yet applied for naturalisation in
that category. Although the Ministry is
embarrassed about what seems to have
been a bureaucratic blunder, it is not
backing down.
The case is in contrast to the Brother
Daniel case of 1962 when a member of
the Carmelite Order applied for citizen-
ship under the Law of Return on the
grounds that his mother was Jewish.
Brother Daniel, though already a con-
vert, had risked his life to save many
Jews from the Nazis and considered him-
self to be Jewish. In rejecting his appli-
cation by a majority of 4-1 the Israeli
Supreme Court, in one of its most his-
toric judgments, based its decision on the
everyday meaning of “Jew” to the ordi-
nary Israeli.
They rejected the religious criteria ac-
cording to which an apostate cannot
strip himself of his Jewishness. The
judges argued that the Jewish people
were essentially an historical community
and that by converting to another faith
Brother Daniel had broken with that
community. They did not attempt to
answer the question of “Who is a Jew?”
but they did answer the question “Who
is not a Jew?” An apostate is not. In
this view, Mrs Eitani could be con-
sidered Jewish having been brought up
as Jewish and affirming, her links with
the historical community in a very direct
way.
But the Minister of the Interior, Mr
Moshe Shapiro, an orthodox Jew, has
instructed his department to follow the
rules of the rabbinical law in determin-
ing who is a Jew —and that is anyone
who was born of a Jewish mother.
All very complicated—and for the
young Israeli further evidence that his
4000-year-old religion is not always rele-
vant to his own time and a modern
State’s needs.
One question raised by the Eitani case
is what will happen if the Soviet Union
decides to release some of its three mil-
lion Jews in any large numbers. There
could then be hundreds of Jews without
records testifying to thqir origins, un-
certain whether their mothers had been
formally converted or not. There are
also broader questions which Prime
Minister Levi Eshkol acknowledged
when in commenting on the case he said
that the question of deciding the proper
relationship between State and Religion
would have to wait for the next genera-
tion.
When Israeli leaders, secular and reli-
gious, find themselves asking “Who is a
Jew?” they are really asking what kind
of State Israel is to be—theocracy,
Levantine republic, welfare-state demo-
cracy. The Kulturkampf has led to wide-
spread public cynicism about the rela-

tionship between religion and politics, a
cynicism which becomes quite bitter
in cases like the Eitani one. Out of
Israel’s two million Jews perhaps only
one-fifth would be regarded as orthodox,
and as few as 15 per cent vote for the
three religious parties combined. But
even the casual visitor notes the wide-
spread influence of the orthodox groups
in such things as prohibition of public
transport on the Sabbath and the closing
down of other public facilities, and the
absence of civil marriage and divorce
(this being completely under rabbinical
jurisdiction). The religious minority
exerts this control over the non-religious
majority through its political parties in
the coalition—principally the National
Religious Party—exerting pressure for
legislation in return for support of the
largest political party, Mapai.
Some critics claim that Mapai has
acted out of political expediency in
agreeing to religious demands, but there
is some evidence that a good deal of the
legislation would have been passed in any
case, the prohibition on Sabbath trans-
port for example —even if the NRP had
not been in the coalition. This view is
supported by some leading orthodox
Jewish thinkers inside and outside Israel
who regard the formation of political
religious' parties as a tragedy for the
future of religious Judaism. Every time
there is an Eitani case or one like it
their case seems to be strengthened.
Dedicated in principle to the pro-
motion of the ethical and social values
of Judaism in the life of the State a-nd
to fostering legislation founded on
rabbinical law, the National Religious
Party finds its own practice in a party
political organisation results in the same
less than spiritual tactics of other parties.
The Eitani case, for example, would
almost certainly have never come to
light had it not been for the local poli-
tical intrigues of Upper Nazareth. In
this new town of 15,000 the orthodox
were in a minority but they fought stub-
bornly for their right to special faci-
lities. The local council run by Mapai
members refused to allot rooms in a
council building for an orthodox' kinder-
garten because the number fell short of
that required. But the relig : ous minority
had an ally in the Ministry of the In-
terior who began to delay their allot-
ments to Upper Nazareth. The council
protested and Councillor Mrs Eitani
was among the most bitter and vocal
opponents of the NRP. When stories
began spreading about the “Gentile
woman”, Mrs Eitani tried to convert
but found that the Rabbinate in Tiberias,
to whom she applied, had been advised
to reject the application because she was
anti-religious.
The information came from an un-
known source but it was clearly the
same which had brought the interven-
tion of the orthodox-dominated Ministry
of the Interior local party zealots
whose zeal has embarrassed the NRP
leaders sensitive to charges of “theocrat”.
Israel is not a theocracy—but the
government, largely for political reasons
and partly for ideological ones, has ac-
cepted the influence of a theocratic
spirit. Despite the disillusionment with
the religious parties the opposition to
them is generally passive and unco-
ordinated. An organisation known as
the League to prevent Religious
Coercion, which the writer Meyer Levin
(“Compulsion”) founded, is trying to
change this. But it has few members
and is more influential among some Jews
in the United States than in Israel.
If the religious elements lose the battle
between the sacred and the profane in
Israel it will not be because of such
organisations but because of their own
failures in cases like that of Mrs Eitani.

Letters to the Editor
The Boxing Game
SIR. I am writing in regard to the
article titled “Is Boxing Necessary?” (8.,
February 27). While I agree that boxing
is at a particularly low ebb in Aus-
tralia, I cannot agree with the sentiments
and ideas expressed by “Discus” in the
article.
“Discus” referred to a grounding for
professional boxing as having a basis in
amateur boxing. He said many amateurs
don’t get the correct training and this
“neglect of basic training can be seen,
sometimes almost tragically, in the fight-
ing ability of amateurs who turn pro-
fessional in Australia”. This statement
may be true, it is merely an opinion, but
to apply this statement to Sid Prior could
not be further from the truth. Sid Prior
graduated to professional ranks, was
trained correctly and won the Australian
Welterweight title without losing a pro-
fessional fight!

“Modernism” of Aust. Poetry
SIR. R. A. Simpson proudly talks of
the “modernism” of recent Australian
poetry (8., February 27) and pats him-
self on the back for being daring enough
to publish it.
Yet, from his comments we note that
the modernism he refers to is the in-
fluence of Eliot and Pound (i.e., of
poetry written c. 1920, which, in fact,
introduced nineteenth century French
techniques into English poetry). Simp-
son speaks of the “radical” influence of
the American academic poets Stafford
and Lowell on Alexander Craig and
Evan Jones —yet these “radical” poets
are content to emulate the 1920 s work
of Eliot and Pound. Bruce Dawe is
praised for writing in the style of E. E.
Cummings, another poet of the 19205.
Are not Simpson and his fellow poets
aware of any other poetry than that pub-
lished by American university, and con-
servative English, magazines?
There are poets in England and
America who have in fact kept pace with
the developments made in music and
painting. American poets like Charles
Olsen, Robert Creely and Robert Dun-
can write abstract expressionist poetry,
and Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso
and others have developed the tech-
niques of the cubist and surrealist poets
of Europe.
If such poets as these are too “mod-
ernist” to be taken seriously by our
poets and magazine editors, what hope
have we in Australia of developing
poetry along the “modernist” lines of
the 19605, e.g., the serialist poetry of
the Englishman Tom McGrath, the
concrete poetry of Dom Sylvester
Houedard, and the kinetic poetry of lan
Hamilton Finlay.

The Film Industry
SlR.—Some of us who are refugees from
Australian film making live so far away
that it takes a little time for publications
to reach us, specifically The Bulletin
(February 13) which contained Charles
Higham’s piece on the future-if-any of
Australian films. His historical survey
contains material that is well enough
known but does no harm in the restating.
A variety of intelligent opinions have been
garnered, from people like Lee Robinson
and John Kingsford Smith.
Yet in the end Mr Higham argues
AGAINST any form of government pro-
tection or assistance for an indigenous in-
dustry, asserts that the only hope lies in
proving through the emergence of an
Australian New Wave that there may in-
deed be some authentic artists here. They
would merit attention; somehow or other
out of this might come an industry. He
endeavors to indicate that the example to
follow here are the French and British
“New Waves”. This is a fallacious asser-
tion.
If any one man was responsible for
the French “New Wave” it was the Mini-
ster of Culture, M Andre Malraux. He
saw the need for an infusion, paved the
way for some younger men to move into
production.
In the United Kingdom another kind of
“New Wave” swept forward because a
vacuum needed to be filled. There
were scores* of able technicians about
hungry for work, fine actors waiting for
engagements. In other words a time of in-
tense crisis made a “New Wave” feasible.
Yet it should be remembered that a quota
system, the Eaddie levy and National
Finance Bank money were also available.
CECIL HOLMES
Darwin (NT).
CHARLES HIGHAM: I stated the
case for and against Government spon-
sorship with a clarity that escaped Mr
Holmes. Britain's “New Wave” began
because of a few driving talents, not
because of an unemployment problem;
“scores of technicians” did not make
“O Dreamland” and it contained no
actors. M Malraux was not-respons-
ible for the “New Wave”; Truffaut,
Goddard and their like were responsible.


REVIEWS
THEATRE
Japanese Masks
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
Toda-San. Hal Porter. Union Hall, Ade-
laide.
Hal Porter's new play, “Toda-San”, is
set in modern Japan, in an odd guest-
house that contains both ceremonial
chastity and sex for a fee, where votive
offerings are made to a shrine in the
garden, and propositions made to a
pretty Japanese girl. The guest-house is
run by Gretel Beaufort, worldly sister
of a saintly Australian Professor of
English who lives there, and is thus
able to indulge himself in woodcuts he
cannot afford, and in relationships he
need not pursue. The exception is his
student, Toda Ito, the Toda-San of the
title, to whom the professor is god but
whom the Professor must also worship.
In the guest-house both art and flesh
must be paid for, and all the char-
acters are involved, at least eight of
them, in this guest-house brew-up of
comedy, tragedy, melodrama, ceremonial
and witty bitchery.
The play is about masks, where cor-
ruption can wear the face of innocence,
and vice-versa, and where the destruc-
tion of innocence can be the result of
the deliberate assumption of a mask.
Porter is not interested here in the
developments of character so much as
revelation of character. All is static as
a woodcut or a mask, until the wooden
mask is torn away, showing the hurt
flesh.
At first this seems to be a play about
flesh. It is rank summer, the suicide
month, and the animal scents are dis-
turbing all those who are not saints or
safe in harbors of whisky or gin. The
young Australians, Roger Craven and
David Monteith, are both lechers whose
yen for Fusehime-San, the Japanese
servant who is also a student and an
actress, must be paid for in triple fig-
ures. Helen Rochester, the visiting
Australian who is too thorough in her
approach to be called a mere tourist,
is gawkily emancipated enough to long
for a Japanese lover. But Toda-San is
not interested in the flesh, although
Fusehime-San is prepared to assuage
lechery for a good cause. Toda-San is
in the orbit of a sainthood. The Pro-
fessor and he sleep together, which as
Gretel explains to a startled Miss
Rochester means sharing the same
mosquito-net and talking about chas-
tity. One wonders, but it seems in the
end that this is really so. The Pro-
fessor is above sex, but not so immune
that he cannot be disastrously disgusted
by it; he should be as cold but also as
pure as the god in the shrine.
Surrounded by the generous witticisms
of Gretel (“Gilbert’s too intellectual to
think”; “We’re as genteel as buggery”),
the main line of action follows the de-
votion of Fusehime-San for Toda-San,
and her willingness to prostitute herself
for his sake. Whatever her actions, she
preserves her innocence, and whatever
the origins of her money that Toda-San
takes to buy woodcuts for the Pro-
fessor, he does not wish to lift the
mask of beauty. He also, for a while,
is innocent. On the fringe of this comes
Miss Rochester, trying to understand
the soul of Japan with all the ardor of
ignorance, but, unexpectedly, acquiring
knowledge, and doing more than any-
one else to give innocence back its
mask again. The Australians are all
corrupted, the Professor by sainthood,
Gretel, genially so, by the world, Irene
Craven by whisky, Roger and David
by the flesh.
The major flaw of the play is that
neither the Professor nor Toda-San,
who control the line of the main action,
are vital enough to involve the audi-
ence’s emotion. In addition Toda-San
has to" carry off a long-delayed first
entry that would out-tax a Laurence
Olivier, and a tremendous climax which,
respecting the author's plea in the pro-
gramme, should not be divulged.
Iris Hart is splendid as Gretel, know-
ing all, but not quite forgiving or mock-
ing all. Barbara West, as Fusehime
Ishimoto, has the most difficult and the
most moving part in the play. She con-
veys innocence most touchingly, and
manages the moments of hate as well,
but she does not quite surmount the
difficulties of movement and voice in-
volved in the part. The most original
character in the play, surprisingly
enough, is Miss Rochester, and Lesley
Horsfall is remarkably good, looking
uncannily like Ken Tynan as she de-
livers Tynan-like blasts against the
moral turpitude of the older generation.

Fade Out Fade In. Book and lyrics by
Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Music
by Jule Styne. Tivoli Theatre, Sydney.
“The Knack” is a gentle, moderately
avant-garde farce about three young
men and sex. Tolen adopts a coldly
scientific approach to the problem and
cunningly traps his women with a
variety of bait. For him they are as
plentiful as rabbits before myxomatosis.
For the timid and unenterprising Colin
they are almost as rare as the phoenix.
He begs instruction from Tolen on how
to acquire “the knack”. Tom is more
interested in decorating his room, and
he remains a centre of calm in the midst
of growing chaos. This develops after
the arrival of Nancy, fresh from the
provinces, in search of the YWCA. In
the very funny third act the hysterical
Nancy dumbfounds the woman-chasers
with the assertion that she has been
raped.
The laconic, inconsequential dialogue,
rising at times to bursts of eloquence,
is characteristic of many avant-garde
plays, as is the mildly farcical, vaguely
philosophical by-play with pieces of
furniture. But Ann Jellicoe’s dialogue
does not have the brilliance of Beckett’s
or the economy of Pinter’s, nor do her
objects have the significance of lonesco’s
or Simpson’s.
Eli Ask’s production, while careful
and polished, suffers from understate-
ment. Admittedly “The Knack” is a
farce of understatement, but no matter
how low the key there needs to be a
sharpness and explosiveness in farce
which this muffled style of acting blurs.
Reginald Livermore's Tom is most
noticeably muted, but nevertheless a
pleasure to watch. Peter Whitford’s
awkward Colin seems exactly right, Tom
Oliver’s Tolen is like a young Nazi and
Janne Coghlan plays a harassed Nancy.
“Fade Out—Fade In” is a nostalgic
satire on Hollywood in the ’thirties. It
is a busy, crow'ded musical in a fast-
moving production by Alex Palermo.
The quality of the satire is distinctly sub-

Pressure Point. Director, Hubert Cornfield.
Recently at Esquire Theatre, Sydney.
War Hunt. Director, Denis Sanders.
Recently at Esquire Theatre, Sydney.
“Pressure Point” was produced by Stan-
ley Kramer, so it’s inevitably a “state-
ment”. Sidney Poitier plays a prison
psychiatrist who in the early days of the
war is confronted with a Negro- and
Jew-hating prisoner jailed for sedition.
Fighting against his patient’s obstructive
contempt for him as a black man, the
psychiatrist manages to uncover the in-
fluences which turned him into a Fascist.
Cornfield uses the flashback technique
necessitated by any plot based on psycho-
analysis with remarkable skill. The
central performances are forceful. In
particular Bobby Darin (of all people)
is remarkably impressive as the patient,
while Sidney Poitier brings dignity, made
human by uncontrollable flashes of anger,
to the role of the psychiatrist.
Set during the last days of the Korean
war, “War Hunt” also tells the story of
a psychopath, a soldier who nightly
penetrates behind enemy lines to gather
information, but whose purpose is his
almost ritual killing of the scouts he finds
there.
He is a man almost totally out of
touch with human reality (a point made
clear in Denis Sanders’ brilliant direction
of John Saxon's remote, understated per-
formance). His fellow soldiers admire,
use and shun him: it is only the inter-
ference of a well-meaning new recruit
that inadvertently pitches him over into
complete madness.
Ted McCord’s photography, particu-
larly in the night scenes, is invariably
effective both visually and dramatically.
The whole film, apart from its obvious
dramatic content, is an implied comment
on the whole insanity of war, and in-
cludes a memorable scene of a soldier
dying, not with dignity or nobility, but
with anger and fear.

The playing of Dolmetsch and Saxby,
until the English Music of the 16th and

and only when they reached the rococo
Pugnani’s “Sonata in F Major” for Des-
cant, Recorder and Harpsichord did the
duo show their true musical qualities.
These lecture-recitals, as Dr Dolmetsch
introduced each new instrument and then
the work, would be quite fascinating if
they were one or the other lectures

In this hall, acoustically treacherous
and atmospherically quite-unfavorable, I
found that this concert failed to con-
vince. To hear Dr Dolmetsch in a small
theatre, or even in the surroundings of
one’s own home, would be delightful.
The intentions of those sponsoring the
tour I do not doubt, and I do hope they
continue to bring such musical rarities
to this country, but I feel that there is no
need to announce instrumentalists de-
voted to the refinements of early music
as though they were a hillbilly troupe, or

The Cargo Cult
By J. H. WOOTTEN
Road Belong Cargo. Peter Lawrence. Mel-
bourne University Press. 50s.
The Madang District of New Guinea
has been under European adminis-
tration since 1885. Administration,
missionary and commercial contact has
been continuous and relatively intense.
Yet as late as 1950 it was possible for a
widespread cargo cult to exist in the
District, founded on a complete native
misunderstanding of the nature of Euro-
pean society and economy, and largely
unknown to the Administration and
certainly not understood by it. It would
still be known only in a fragmentary way,
and would certainly not be nearly as
well understood, if a young anthropolo-
gist named Peter Lawrence had not
chanced to select the area for his first
field research in 1949.
In his book “Road Belong Cargo”
every fact of history and anthropology
has been marshalled to its appropriate
place in an explanation, not only of what
happened in Madang from 1885 to
1950, but of why it happened. It is all
lucidly presented in a tight and compel-
ling argument, yet the book is most
readable. There is no trace of jargon,
no parading of useless nomenclature, no
waffling, nothing to deter the intelligent
reader willing to come to grips with a
difficult but fascinating and crucial
problem.
The fundamentals of the Madang
situation are typical rather than unique
in the Territory. The “cargo” referred
to is all the material paraphernalia of
Western society tinned meat, furni-
ture, cars, radios, rifles which arrives
in New Guinea as the cargo of ships
and planes, invariably addressed to
Europeans. It is this cargo which main-
tains the power of the Europeans and
provides them with the comfortable life
so envied by the natives. The cargo cult
involves some form of action by a native
group carried on in the belief that it is
the “road belong cargo” the thing
that will at last cause the cargo to come
for the benefit of the natives.
It is when the road is seen to lie in
some destructive activity, some chal-
lenge to authority, in anti-white re-
actions, or in some other rejection of
European values, that the cargo cult
attracts notice and is labelled as such.
When the road is seen to lie through
education, or speaking English, or com-
pliance with European wishes, or the
adoption of some European-approved
institution, it will more often be regard-
ed simply as a heartening example of
native progress. When enthusiasm dies
and the road is abandoned it will per-
haps be considered an example of
native lack of persistence. In truth, all
that will have happened will be that the
road has been proved false in native
eyes because its pursuit did not cause
the cargo to arrive.
The material goods of Western
society are seen, not as the fruit of labor
channelled by the progressive inventions
of the human mind over the centuries,
but as something vouchsafed to mankind
by a superhuman source. The fact that
it arrives for Europeans and not for
natives is explained either as the result
of Europeans fraudulently appropriating
the native share to themselves, or as the
result of Europeans possessing some
secret which they refuse to pass on to
the natives in order to preserve their
privileged position.
The fact that such misconceptions
could be general in an area such as
Madang is not in the slightest degree to
be attributed to native stupidity. The
equality of native to European intelli-
gence is attested in many ways, not
least in the tightly argued hypotheses
which underlie the cargo myths them-
selves.
Natives seldom see Europeans doing
physical labor, or anything else recog-
nisable to them as productive work. Euro-
peans are not seen to manufacture
goods, and often do not know how they
originate. I remember my own discom-
fiture, after assuring natives in a cargo
cult area that we Europeans made all
our goods, to be politely asked how the
kerosene in my lamp was made.
It is Dr Lawrence’s great contribution
that he explains that there are reasons
deep in traditional native epistemology
why they misinterpret our culture, and
rationally adopt explanations which we
find grotesque.
Traditional native society was static,
and there was no concept of an evolving
society or developing body of know-
ledge. Knowledge was not regarded as
a product of the human intellect, but as
the gift of some superhuman being.
Although the basis of the intellectual
system was religious, the whole was
essentially materialistic and anthropo-
centric. Religion itself was, in Mc-
Auley's phrase, “above all a techno-
logy”. If the right rituals and spells were
used, the crops would flourish and men
would prosper. Society was egalitarian,
all had equal access to resources, wealth
could not be stored, and social relation-
ships were expressed in the exchange of
equivalent goods and services. Hence
the Europeans’ monopoly of the cargo
was not merely a cruel deprivation; it
ruled out satisfactory social relations be-
tween the races.
Starting from this view of the world,
the cargo myth is a rational explanation
of the contact situation. It is woven into
the local myths, Christian teaching and
scraps of information about the outside
world to reconcile it with other know-
ledge possessed by natives. In the Ma-
dang District there resulted such fascin-
ating conclusions as that Rome was in
the Queensland Museum (where Euro-
peans collected pagan religious objects),
and that Jesus-Manup was held captive
by the Jews in Heaven (a place above
Sydney reached by a ladder) in order
that- he could not send cargo to the
people of New Guinea.
If there is one criticism to be made
of the book, it is the under-emphasis
on the emotional stresses in the native
community, particularly the tremendous
yearning for the restoration of brother-
hood or human dignity, which is denied


by the unequal relationship with Euro-
peans. Perhaps Dr Lawrence is reacting
against earlier writers on cargo cults,
who have stressed the emotional aspects,
and failed to go on, as he has done, to
understand the rational structure of the
cargo myths and the epistemology
which moulds them. But it seems an
unduly colorless account of native feel-
ings to refer simply to a desire for satis-
factory relations with Europeans.
Burridge, another student of cargo
cult in the Madang District, was no less
scientific for such a vivid illustration of
native reaction to the denial of equiva-
lence as this:
“The fact is that when Tangu face a
European, eye to blazing eye, within
arm's length, the sap runs dry. Tangu
submit. And they know that they do
so. But they would like it to be other-
wise. ‘Are we dogs?’ they cry in im-
passioned fury. ‘Are we not men as
they are?’ ”
But this is no more than a matter
of emphasis, for Dr Lawrence puts the
pattern of race relations as the crucial
factor in cargo cult motivation, and is
forthright in his condemnation of the
pattern. In his treatment of Yali, the
tragic leader, he sensitively brings out
the bewilderment and frustrations of a
native who had been relatively success-
ful in his relations with Europeans. Yet
Yali's mind never met theirs on common
assumptions about the universe.
Until there is a resolution of this basic
conflict, every step we take in New
Guinea is open to misunderstanding. We
see the establishment of a House of
Assembly or a trade union as a step in
the gradual evolution of a new political
and social order. To many natives it will
be meaningful only as another possible
road to the cargo, and when the cargo
does not appear the institution will be
discredited. We may see the Public Ser-
vice salary cuts as an attempt to estab-
a viable economy; many natives
may see it as yet another European
trick to deny natives a fair share of the
cargo. Even when the idea of manufac-
turing the cargo goods is understood,
the same framework of thought, if not
displaced, can easily attach itself to
other desired ends political power,
economic viability, national prestige,
and so forth.
Dr Lawrence gives no comfort to
those who would infer that we should
go slowly in New Guinea. Slowness
means the continuation of misunder-
standing. the compounding of frustration
and bitterness into racial hatred. He
considers that our primary objective
should be radical change in the econ-
omic field, so as to destroy the static
character of native society and prove
old assumptions false, and so force
natives to think according to the new
assumptions we are trying to introduce.
Terror in Palestine
The Time of Green Ginger. Armstrong
King. Macmillan. 325. 6d.
The March of the Innocents. John Wiles.
Chatto and Windus. 265. 6d.
Except that every incident is given dra-
matic impact by imagined detail, “The
Time of Green Ginger” is more history
than fiction. However classified, it is a
sane, well-balanced, grimly realistic
narrative, ambitious in its scope and
written in straightforward, no-nonsense
prose. Seldom is such consistently fine
writing encountered in a first novel.
To summarise the plot would be to
outline the history of Palestine between
the 1939 White Paper restricting immi-
gration to the end of the British Man-
date in 1948. With complete objectivity,
Armstrong King conveys every aspect
of this troubled period through the
words and actions of the people in-
volved. whatever their nationality. As
Mr King was himself a participant, it
is all the more commendable that his
book is not pro-Jewish, pro-Arab, or
even, particularly, pro-British; he ex-
plores the whole intolerable situation
with rare intellectual honesty and com-
passion.
The book's documentary character
does not exclude excitement: the ex-
ploits of the sinister Irgun Zvai Leumi
are as gripping as any thriller and no-
thing could be more horrifying than the
vicious, drunken mob in the streets of
Bethlehem on Christmas Eve struggling
and fighting to the cry, in a dozen lan-
guages, of “Christ is born!” In many
passages, the author’s intensity of feeling
and his understanding of human misery
lift his prose to almost Dostoevskian
heights and yet, throughout, one is con-
scious of his lack of pretension.
If the novel has a hero, it is Colonel
Bond, Press liaison officer for the Bri-
tish, who, in love with the country and
morbidly fascinated by its seemingly in-
soluble problems, feels compelled to
await the outcome despite the danger to
his own life. His Press conferences,
besides providing some much needed
humorous relief, act as a Greek chorus
commenting on the action. But the
story has a dozen heroes and as many
villains, besides the ordinary inhabitants
who are simply caught up in the general
despair and frustration.
For the past eight years, Armstrong
King has been teaching in Melbourne;
perhaps his next novel will have an
Australian setting.
I approached “The March of the
Innocents” warily: there is an inbuilt
phoniness about so many historical
novels and this is often accentuated by
a religious theme. However, John Wiles’
fictional treatment of the Children’s
Crusade is not the usual chocolate-
coated history, but a sincere and earthy
attempt to make this extraordinary
legend believable. Because of this it
is probably doomed to gather dust on
library shelves and be remaindered by
bookshops.
Pernoud’s “The Crusades” gives the
following account of the Children’s
Crusade: “In May, 1212, a shepherd boy
of twelve called Stephen announced that
Christ had told him to go on a Crusade
to conquer the Holy Land. As he tra-
velled round France preaching this, his
enthusiasm fired the children until, by
the time he reached Marseilles, it was
said that thirty thousand of them had
joined him. He had promised them that
the seas would open and let them
through dryshod and they were bitterly
disappointed when this did not happen.
Instead they went on board several
merchant ships and for eighteen years
nothing was heard of them. Then it
was learnt that some had been drowned
and the rest sold as slaves in Algeria
and Egypt.”
Mr Wiles is faithful to the facts as
outlined here, ending his story with the
shipwreck in which Stephen is drowned
and making his point that, although the
Crusade was a failure, the faith of the
children has made a lasting impression
in the hearts of men.
By no means juvenile in its treatment
(one is reminded of “Lord of the Flies”),
the reader is spared none of the horrors
of the journey and the medieval lan-
guage is gamey and colorful if not
always consistent. God’s Bonnet! Con-
sidering my prejudice, I didst enjoy the
tale more than I had thought possible.

Midget of Destiny
The Memoirs of General Grivas. Edited
by Charles Foley. Longmans. 38s. 6d.
Guerrilla Warfare and EOKA’S Struggle.
General George Grivas, translated from
the Greek by A. A. Pallis. Longmans.
38s. 6d.
These are the memoirs of a miniature
man of destiny. General George Grivas,
leader of the terrorist organisation
EOKA, which forced Britain to give
independence to Cyprus, has most of
the attributes of a Napoleon or a
De Gaulle: the iron will, the hunger for
victory, the almost infallible powers of
leadership and the utter confidence in
them, the egocentricity. Missing, how-
ever, are imagination and intellectual
integrity: the “x” quantities which make
for greatness. Greatness the General
is patently avid for—but two things
deny it to him. The first is the stage
on which he had to play his grand role:
the island of Cyprus. No cultural and
historical backwater 140 miles long and
60 miles wide can hope to be one
of the great European stages. The
second obstacle is that lack of integrity
in Grivas’s mental attitudes which
emerges throughout the book. It should
be stressed that one can come to this
conclusion without even considering the
final rightness or otherwise of the cause
Grivas pursued, and which in the end
he lost: Enosis, or union with Greece.
What one is forced to question are the
methods of Grivas's war, and whether
it was a true war at all. Willy-nilly, this
book brings us up against one of the
most cogent moral problems of our
time: when does guerrilla warfare, and
rebellion by a civilian population, cease
to be war and become arbitrary and
unjustified murder? I would say it is
murder when the occupying power has
itself initially been guilty of no killings
or brutality. This was the case of
Britain in Cyprus, and therefore, despite
the reasonableness of Cypriot desire for
independence from Britain, one cannot
view Grivas’s carnage with enthusiasm.
Of his success as strategist, organiser
and fighting man there can be no
doubt. The memoirs are a compel-
ling stage-by-stage account of how a
remarkable guerrilla leader took advan-
tage of every possible element in the
situation within which he had to operate,
and with an initially undisciplined band
of enthusiastic civilians, thugs and
schoolchildren, wore out the patience of
a great power and won. Like all revo-
lutionaries, he lost the peace; and the
wily Makarios, who condoned the
butchery as long as it was safe, and
against whom Grivas rails bitterly, gave
Cyprus not Grivas’s beloved Enosis but
an independence entangling it with
Turkey.
In the companion book to these
memoirs, “Guerrilla Warfare”—a work
mainly of interest to the military expert
—Grivas, like Che Guevara and Mao
Tse-tung, has prepared what he believes
to be a manual for guerrilla leaders of
the nuclear age. In it he gives his tactics
for a small, weak foe to apply against
a strong one. How these would work
elsewhere than -Cyprus is for the expert
to decide—but in the wooded mountain
terrain of Cyprus they worked beauti-
fully. Methods of attack must be sur-
prise and ruse (only small army groups
were attacked from ambush) and the rest
is murder and sabotage by civilians.
There must be one hidden leader, whose
word is law, and lines of command
must radiate from his hideout to various
district leaders. He must be utterly
brave and resourceful (Grivas brags
constantly of his possession of these
qualities). Discipline is essential', the
indoctrination of the people, particularly
the young, is essential; support by the
civil population is essential. How,
finally, was this achieved in Cyprus?
Grivas had a ready answer: “Execu-
tion”. This meant the shooting of
any Cypriot who betrayed EOKA, or
supported the British administration.
The manual concludes with a grim pro-
phecy of such warfare following use of
nuclear weapons. “There will be no
front and no rear, and the whole coun-
try will become a battlefield.”
What did such warfare mean, and
what of the nature of those who waged
it? Grivas is full of Homeric dreams,
and strives ludicrously to make his
Greeks (a Slav-Albanian mixture) the
true descendants of the vanished Hel-
lenic heroes. The General, five feet
three, has been described by observers
as standing on tiptoe when excited, in
a vain effort for greater stature; he
stands on tiptoe in these memoirs,
likening himself to the Byzantine hero
Dighenis, whose name he took, and his
followers to Leonidas’s Spartans. It is
worth recalling that his “warfare” in-
volved throwing bombs into cafes to
kill and maim innocent civilians. Grivas
strives to whitewash all this.
Grivas's mental dishonesty emerges in
the following passages: The British
have to be “forced” to see that this is
war. - Well and good. But when they
do so, Grivas complains. British casual-
ties are reported with tough glee, but
those of his own side are presented with
righteous sorrow, and complaints of
Albion's perfidy. When the British kill
one of his guerrilla leaders in a fight,
Grivas describes the “hideously charred
remains” with pious horror. Yet we are
told with satisfaction how some of
EOKA’s high school heroes laid a
bomb to blow up British soldiers play-
ing a football game. It killed two and
hideously maimed five others. When
the regiment then ransacked the village,
Grivas was outraged because they got
rough, although they killed no one. One

da Press. 395. 6d.
It cannot be by accident that Keith
Willey begins his first chapter with a
quotation from C. J. Dennis’ “The
Swanks of Gosh” and his last chapter
with one from the same poet’s “Hymn
of Futility”. For Willey is the Northern
Territory's own sentimental bloke, as
much in style as in philosophy. In this
part - memoir, part - travelogue, part-
pamphlet covering some eight years of
working and travelling in the North,
Willey is a self-confessed heir to the
C. J. Dennis brand of romanticism.
"Sometimes, however, he seems unwil-
ling to realise that this creates a dilemma
of choice about the kind of place he
thinks the Territory ought to be. He
wants progress to come, rapidly to the
Territory. He is bitter about the failure
of the Commonwealth Government's
past record in the North which he says,
with some justice, has been one of
“stupidity, disinterest and broken faith
for more than half a century”. He is
passionate in his belief that the future
of Australia depends literally on whether
or not the North is developed, and
developed quickly. He warns that for
“Australians on their golden island set
in a sea of hunger, misery and hatred,
time is fast running out”.
However, it is Willey’s endless supply
of stories about the “characters” of the
Territory which provides the book's
most memorable feature. Perhaps some
of his stories are too apocryphal even
for the greatest bulldusters in the world,
but those about Darwin, where the
drinkers at the Hotel Darwin laid bets
while “one lost soul" prepared to com-
mit suicide from the top of the water
tower, or those about Alice Springs
where “Tall Tale” Tex Tyrrell beat
“Walkie Talkie” Nelson for the world
wind-bagging championship, are very
much the stuff of genuine folklore.

If for many of us the ’thirties merely
means Auden, Day Lewis, Spender, and
MacNeice, then this new Penguin an-
thology, which gathers together more
than 45 poets, shows just what a variety
of poetic activities was being carried out
during that decade. It may have been
the era of Macspaunday; but it was, as
well, the time of the surrealism of David
Gascoyne and George Barker, the time
of the early Betjeman and the youthful
Dylan Thomas, when F. T. Prince was
writing his beautiful, neglected poems.
As Robin Skelton says in his excellent
introduction “even before they were
quite over the ’thirties took on the
appearance of myth”. The ’thirties pro-
duced a generation of poets closely in-
volved in the social and political events
of their time (Peace Conferences, Hun-
ger Marches, the Spanish Civil War, the
Nazi and the Fascist threat) who tried
to reconcile art and propaganda and
who were always ready to sacrifice their
art if the propaganda work could get
done without it. These poets were pre-
occupied with the idea of community;
they wanted to change society. They
wrote poems of criticism and protest.
They were all anxious to start an affaire
between Marx and the Muse, though
both finally refused to co-operate and
the poets were left to go their different
ways.
With few exceptions I think it fair to
say that the ’thirties’ poets believed ex-
clusively in content, in sacred subjects
(such as “Working Class Solidarity”
the theme of several poems gathered
here). Many were apparently con-
vinced that to write about a major
event was to write an important poem.
Certainly from the point of view of con-
tent there isn't a trivial poem in this
book, though the poetic inferiority of
many pieces disastrously trivialises their
subjects.
Donald Hall’s “A Roof of Tiger
Lilies” is extraordinarily impressive:
not just a collection of verses, some
good, some merely make-weight, but a
book of poems with all their words in
place, each with its own calm authority.
Hall is an American who has lived much
in England, and his poems “Letter to an
English Poet”, “An American in an
Essex Village” delineate with insight the
paradoxical relationship of an American
to Europe.
“The London Magazine” continues to
be as eclectic as it recently promised.
Articles on music (Brigid Brophy on
Mozart) and the cinema (Charles
Higham on David Lean), the latest in-
stalment of Maclaren-Ross's fascinating
memoirs and Tony Tanner's comments
on Robert Frost make this a rewarding
number.
“Art and Literature” is a new avant-
garde magazine published in Switzer-
land. This seems to be something of
a French number with translations from
Max Jacob, Roland Barthes, Andre
Masson and Georges Bataiile. There is
a brilliant article by Max Kozloff on
Courbet. The whole is well illustrated.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Piece of the Beatles
Financial columns in London
tended to give the recently floated
Beatles company, Northern Songs,
a short-back-and-sides treatment, thus
trimming it down to a speculative flut-
ter. The market was undeterred and
Northern Songs 2s. shares were over-
subscribed at the issue price of 7s. 9d.
A major criticism was that the com-
pany’s profit record was too short and
that its sole assets comprised the copy-
right of 56 songs already composed by
John Lennon and Paul McCartney,
plus a contract for a minimum of six
songs a year for the next eight years.
John and Paul each own 15 p.c. of
the capital (about £stg3oo,ooo at the
issue price), so they have an incentive
to keep on churning out those songs.
While they’re doing this, the pot is kept
boiling for investors (or fans) by
royalties on records, tape recordings,
profits on sales of sheet music and
other performing rights.
The Stock Exchange waived some of
its requirements for new companies be-
cause of the remarkable profit poten-
tial, forecast at £stgsso,ooo before tax,
for the year to April. To protect the
golden egg laying ability of the two
Beatles, both John and Paul have been
insured by Northern Songs for
£500,000 each. If both were killed in
an accident, the company would collect
£1 million.
No one denies that the issue is a
speculation and few commentators are
prepared to hazard guesses on long-
term prospects. Subscribers to the issue
are confident they will make a killing
and are prepared to let someone else
worry about the long-term investment
prospects.
Whatever the purist objections to the
relaxation of formal Stock Exchange
rules, the prospectus at least earned
full marks for honesty. It actually
estimated a drop in 1965-66 profits,
to £stg4oo,ooo, after the current
year’s lofty £550,000. The lower
figure takes no account of new com-
positions', being based only on the
existing collection.
Curiously, too, the prospectus neg-
lected the Beatles’ coming film, pro-
duction stills from which are beginning
to whet teenage and other enthusiasms.
London (and Liverpool) oversub-
scription was perhaps easy to predict,
in spite of the financial specialists’
scepticism. Places outside England
may be just as keen if the Montreal
“over-the-counter” market furnishes
any guide. Dealings there started just
after application lists closed, at a
healthy margin above the offer price.
The stock market expects solid sup-
port from across the Atlantic. It you
can’t own a lock of the Beatles’ hair,
you can always buy a piece of them
through Northern Songs. -
MONEY CAN BUY
At the forecast dividend of 271 p.c.,
prospective earnings give a three times
cover, after allowing for tax at rates
ruling before the Budget. This gives
an indicated dividend yield of just over
7 p.c. at the issue price of 7s. 9d.
Smile , and Take Risks
Vou can’t force companies into a joint
A venture if they don’t want it, Mr
Keith Funston, president of the New
York Stock Exchange, told a Press
conference last week. You can have a
rule, saying that you must have a joint
venture, but then the overseas com-
panies which don’t want to accept this
condition stay away.
In other words, if you set a rigid
standard on these matters you can miss
out on some beneficial tie-ups. In case
he was misinterpreted as saying that
American companies should have open
season at all times, Mr Funston said
his own private view was that he would
prefer to see a joint venture if it could
be worked out that way. This gives one
less problem to solve by offsetting the
criticism of the locals.
Joint partnerships usually don’t work
unless there is some control, but it
depends on the philosophy of the com-
pany. A 50-50 partnership can bring
complications because neither side
knows which is boss. Yet some direc-
tors say: Neither one of us is boss and
this makes us get along.
Some sort of partnership is desirable,
however, because it makes people feel
so much better when they do have it,
whether they take advantage of it or
not. Because there were no detailed
figures available, people failed to
understand just how prevalent were
American partnerships, because very
often they go into partnership with a
private company or individuals.
Australia has been relying on foreign
capital for about 10 p.c. of its capital
requirements, but it will have to look
forward to supplying more of its own
requirements. Australia could only
achieve this when its money markets
were large enough and people were
prepared to take the risks, Mr Funston
warned.
A constructive analysis of Mr Fun-
ston’s remarks might lead to the con-
clusion that Australians' should be
more outgoing and take more risks
instead of worrying about the over-
seas companies which are prepared to
venture in a country with strong
growth potential. Especially does this
apply now that the normal overseas
money supplies are tightening up.
US Portfolio Drought
TTie blanket extension of the US in-
A terest equalisation tax for another
two years has practically killed port-
folio money coming to Australia, Mr
Funston believes.
The 15 p.c. interest equalisation tax


was imposed primarily as a restraint
on overseas bond raising in America.
The official theory was to add the
equivalent of one p.c. interest rate to
bonds so as to make them more ex-
pensive. This was done by calculating
that a one p.c. average increase in
interest on a 30-year bond should work
out at a tax levy of about 15 p.c.
The trouble was that the Canadians
and Europeans were heavy borrowers
in the US and the Canadians were
exempt. Also, it was discovered that
some of the European borrowers were
borrowing money to repair streets and
other municipal projects which Uncle
Sam thought should be the subject of
local borrowings or the type of loan
which should be raised in Switzerland
(at a higher rate of interest).
As an indication of the need for
America to stop the dollar drain, Mr
Funston quoted outgoings such as
3600 million dollars a year for foreign
aid, 2000 million dollars lost in the
tourist trade, 2000 million dollars in
capital outflow and 2000 million
dollars or more for the upkeep of
troops overseas. The current US
attitude seems to be: If France wants
to get tough, let her carry some of
the burden.
Fashionable Deflation
"Deduction of the imports surcharge
in Britain from 15 p.c. to 10 p.c.
tended to blunt the edge of the
weapon which the Wilson Government
hoped would check the drift in trade.
Now, with a restrictive Budget con-
fronting the British people, the de-
flationary moves in world economies
become more marked.
This inevitably must have some
effect on commodity prices and create
tougher trading conditions.
President Johnson, similarly, is
wielding a big stick on the balance of
payments deficit and US business
leaders have been asked to front the
White House and give a “please
explain”.
Anyone who thought it was merely
a pep talk was disillusioned when in-
structions were given that all corpora-
tions with large overseas interests were
to send three-monthly reports on their
progress at improving their individual
balance of payments position by an
annual margin of 15 to 20 p.c.
The policy outlined by the Johnson
Administration envisages a deferment
of direct investment in developed
countries (which includes Australia)
and a reliance on raising funds over-
seas where new expenditure is re-
quired. A further instruction to remit
more dividends back home to the US
must place further pressure on Aus-
tralia’s international reserves.
End of the Beginning
A lthough it is only a few months
since Australian minerals men
had their extended get-together in
Western Australia, this week sees
them in another and even bigger one,
the eighth Commonwealth Mining and
Metallurgical Congress, at which they
will be joined by a host of their fellows
"That's what caused the 'orrible coughing noise - cigarette ads."
from overseas. To hear 200 of so
papers to be read in a variety of
venues here and also in New Zealand,
which shares the honor of holding it,
the congress will meet until well into
April. Not least of its value to this
country will be a series of surveys pre-
pared for it, covering the Australian
industry in all its diverse aspects from
geology to economic.
On the broadest international view
the appropriateness of having the
congress in Australia is self-evident.
Since the fifth congress met here in
1953 no other country has awakened
such a vast array of untapped mineral
resources or attracted so much inter-
national capital and expertise to
exploit them. Even so, though the
interval has seen so many dreams
come true like the discovery of
commercial oil, the establishment of
an integrated aluminium industry and
the uncovering of the world’s biggest
iron ore deposits this, as Churchill
said in another world context, could
be merely the end of the-beginning.
“C” Day Comes Closer
A recent visit from National Cash
Register executives helped to re-
mind Australia that busy behind-the-
scenes moves are taking place in pre-
paration for Changeover Day (“C”
Day) in February, 19(36. After talk with
the American experts, the impression
is given that many people may leave
their run a little bit late. After all,
it’s less than a year off now.
New coins already are being pro-
duced in Melbourne. There is no
chance, either, that the Reserve Bank
will get caught short with unprinted
notes, because it is prepared to over-
print existing notes by designating the
equivalent figure in dollars.
Cash registers, accounting and add-
ing machines were required to be re-
gistered last August, according to the
age of the machine. This permits
owners to plan ahead with the full
knowledge of which machines will be
converted at Government expense,
which machines will qualify merely
for compensation and which machines
will receive no compensation at all.
There is no clear programme yet on
the registration of electronic com-
puters, punched card tabulators, frank-
ing machines and price computing
machines. Also, motorists will realise
that all computing mechanisms for
petrol pumps will need to be changed
and this presumably will require re-
gistration of all pumps with the autho-
rities if purchased before September
30, 1965.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
A Compulsive Industrial Affair
Realism in employer-employee relations
Tn the continuing depressing circum-
-*• stances of the Mount Isa dispute,
anybody who says anything which
might provide a clue to making the
compulsory arbitration system more
effective in reducing the possibilities of
industrial conflict deserves a good hear-
ing, especially if he comes from the
unions’ side whence enlightened con-
tributions are somewhat exceptional.
Tha't is why what Mr E. C. Deverall,
industrial officer of the Administrative
and Clerical Officers’ Association, had t£>
say to the Victorian Industrial Relations
Society last week commands attention
at this juncture. It was the more im-
portant because his observations bore
mostly on the difficulties union officials
run up against in controlling the sec-
tional aspirations of their members.
Perhaps the community in general will
be all the better, also, for the series of
assurances from this responsible union
leader which is worth quoting at the
outset.
“It is my opinion,” he stated, “that
the overwhelming majority of unions do
try to adopt a responsible attitude to-
wards their own members, towards the
employers of their members and towards
the tribunals. This attitude is based on
honesty of purpose and action, so that
in the formulation and presentation of
its policy and -claims the union con-
cerned says and means the same things,
irrespective of whether the audience is
its own membership, the employers or
the tribunals.”
That being understood, it remains to
explain why the actions of the unions
and also groups of their members acting
unofficially do not invariably fit the pre-
cept and, in consequence, compulsory
arbitration breaks down or in any case
fails to do the jobs of preventing and
solving particular industrial disputes and
even, as in wage fixing, still seems to
leave the main problems unsolved.
To get Mr Deverall’s useful observa-
tions in perspective it could be said that,
quite apart from the running sore of the
compulsory arbitration system’s penal
clause, there are two main areas of
challenge to the effectiveness of the
system.
One of these, which the Arbitration
Commission itself drew attention to in
the basic wage judgment last year, is
the pursuance of industrial claims in the
open market. This is best exemplified,
perhaps, by “wages drift” but certainly
is not confined to that. For different
reasons, both sides of the industrial
fence put their blind eyes to wages drift,
particularly in times of full employment.
Doubtless we will be hearing a lot more
about that in the next few weeks in the
total wage case. In its findings on last
year's total wage submission, the Com-
mission found it an over-riding obstacle
to the implementation of the concept.
The other main area of challenge and
one equally, if not more, related to the
Mount Isa dispute than that from the
uncontrolled open market, is the diffi-
culty experienced by unions registered
under the system, both in Federal and
State spheres, in preventing the explo-
sion of minority opinions within the
unions into open expression, either as
unjustified submission to tribunals or
in strike action. What Mr E. G. Dever-
D. G. FOWLER
all had to say on this point last week
was very much to the point.
Clearly Mr Deverall was pretty fed up
with the equivocal attitude of some
leader writers and politicians who, in his
view, seem to think either that the rank-
and-file members involved should deter-
mine union policy in a particular in-
dustrial situation or that union officers
should exercise virtually dictatorial
powers over the rank and file “who have
been led astray by shop committees or
some un-Australian or non-Australian in-
dividual”.
In his view, both of these diametri-
cally opposed concepts completely ignore
the principles of control of organisa-
tions by the general membership of
unions, as laid down in the Conciliation
and Arbitration Act itself and its regu-
lations. Equally at fault, he said, were
rank-and-file union members who in
a particular industrial situation thought
the union’s duty was to give them sup-
port in the form they wanted, even
though it was opposed to the properly
determined policy of the union or to
its responsibilities to the arbitration tri-
bunals.
It was no wonder that many industrial
disputes • had been unnecessarily pro-
longed simply because rank-and-file
members have been conditioned by
Press and politicians to believe that they
had the right to control the policy and
actions of the union in respect of a
particular matter, Mr Deverall main-
tained.
He cited two cases in which decisions
of the Arbitration Commission (or
Court as it then was) itself, in effect,
penalised unions for attempts to disci-
pline members. He thought it ironical
that a Court which in the first part of
the last decade said that the first duty of
an organisation was to control and dis-
cipline its members, even to the extent
of preventing them from subscribing to
funds for the relief of strikers’ families,
was responsible for laying down princi-
ples which give comfort and support to
dissident groups and which discourage
organisations from adopting- a respon-
sible attitude.
By the same token, he said, because
of overlapping registrations and the
threat of further registrations under the
Act, a union is sometimes tempted to
“play hero"’ and take attitudes which
are popular with some particular group
of members even though these attitudes
may conflict with its declared policy.
(At least it can be said that the AWU
in Queensland has strongly refused to
play this role. If it has not yet had all
that much consolation from the Indus-
trial Commissioner or yet managed to
get the dissentients back into its fold,
the strikers’ only status under the
award is still under the AWU flag.)
Mr Deverall was looking for the
various tribunals to assist more in help-
ing unions to resist irresponsible internal
pressures by discouraging them to pre-
sent claims that cannot be justified, are
not supported by the facts and have not
been raised beforehand with the em-
ployers concerned to define any real
area of dispute. “It is only then that
the arbitral processes should be set in
motion, either for the purpose embody-
ing the terms of the agreement in an

award or agreement or allowing an arbi-
tration on the real issues between the
parties.”
If the unions, on this showing, have
tricky problems in keeping their ranks
in line, speaking on the same panel Mr
D. G. Fowler, national secretary of thre
Metal Trades Industries Association and
the employers’ guiding hand at Arbi-
tration Commission hearings, seemed
envious of their results. For, “taken
separately”, he stated, “the unions will
justifiably claim that in the Australian
Council of Trade Unions they have an
efficient, well-managed, well-publicised
body, getting excellent results for its
members and, leaving aside for the mo-
ment the existence of the separationist
Australian Workers’ Union and the
labyrinthine public- service and white-
collar organisations, nobody will disagree
with this.”
Mr Fowler was not saying that-any
of the 66 employers' organisations regis-
tered under the Act and now being
welded together into a more formidable
bargaining force by the National Em-
ployers’ Policy Committee has ever
shown the same desire as some sectional
groups of union members or particular
unions themselves to break the ranks
and rush irresponsibly towards indus-
trial tribunals. On the other hand he
admitted that if everything in the em-
ployers’ organisational garden is a lot
lovelier than it was, “at the State level
there is much more to be done” and “the
conflicts and suspicions evident at the
State level have kept the national organi-
sations apart for sixty years”.
“Only in the last four years,” he said,
“has emerged the National Employers'
Policy Committee, which is a monumen-
tal recognition that the divisions of the
past have been buried and employers’
organisations are going forward united
and strong. It must be apparent now
that the promulgation and pursuance of
a total wage plan would never have been
possible prior to the emergence of the
Committee.”
Great possibilities may flow from the
formation of this committee. For apart
from the strengthening of employers’
representation in the Arbitration Com-
mission itself, it could ultimately lead
to a lot more effective talking between
the tw'o sides of industry at top level.
On this, Mr Fowler was at pains to
show that neither his Committee nor the
ACTU are at present empowered to do
deals with each other and that the best
thing to emerge so far had been a
greater interchange of views by officers
of both organisations on an unofficial
basis.
Neither the trade unions nor the em-
ployers wanted the Government to take
on more of a catalyst role than it is
doing at present. “We must guard
against Government developing from a
benevolent patriarch in industrial rela-
tions to a demanding, overbearing tyrant
-—the answer must be with the trade
unions and the employers themselves:
that is, if they want an answer,” Mr
Fowler stated.
For himself, he would like to see the
day when the combined trade unions
and the employers go hand-in-hand to
the Government or the Arbitration
-Commission and say: “This is what we
think you should do—after all this is
really our affair.”
CROFSUS
Tickets for the Growth Bus
Attractions for overseas investors
Tn saying that investment in Australia
was uniquely attractive to Japanese
capital, Mr H. Komuro, managing
director of Mitsui in Australia, admitted
to the Melbourne Stock Exchange’s sym-
posium on investment that Japanese in-
vestment here was still in the kindergar-
ten stage and that fundamental under-
standing was lacking on both sides.
“While knowledge of Japan-Australian
trade is fairly extensive at the present
time,” he said, “we do not seem to really
know each other's investment situation."
This may be true, though it is not to
say that Japan hasn't been probing
deeply into the possibilities here or
hasn't come up with any conclusions.
Mr Komuro's understanding, at any
rate, seems to be very acute.
It is impossible altogether to go along
with his explanation that the reason for
Japan being in the kindergarten class is
that it ‘'had no ticket for the bus all
the tickets were taken up by Englishmen
and Americans.” On his own showing,
Japan preferred to make most of its pre-
war overseas investments in South Ameri-
ca and South-East Asia, where, he says,
the environment for investment was less
attractive than Australia’s. His complaint
about pre-war is that “there were almost
no proposals from Australian people for
joint ventures with Japanese interests.”
But how strong were approaches from
the Japanese side in those days?
The truth of the matter seems to be
that pre-war Japan had very little sur-
plus capital to export, that it was too
busily engaged on internal industry to
spare any for this country. Be that as it
may, Japan is now actively seeking part-
ners for joint ventures here mainly to
secure raw materials for its own use. In
pursuit of this object the inflow of Jap-
anese capital is increasing and Mr Ko-
muro expects it to rise some twenty-fokl
by 1972.
After noting, like other speakers from
Britain, the United States and Japan,
our general attractions for overseas in-
vestment, Mr Komuro said there was
one in particular for Japanese capital
that is, that Japan needs to drink deep
from the cup of Australia's great poten-
tial natural resources. So it was, above
all else, looking for joint ventures in
minerals and rural industries, for whose
products big potential markets await in
Japan.
From what he said about our second-
ary industry, not much Japanese filtra-
tion there can be expected. To start
with, he said that Japan lacks a clear
understanding of Australian industrial


policy and doubts whether sufficient
profits can be made under Australian
tariff protection! If it went into second-
ary industry its first choice would be
for joint ventures in industries likely to
be competitive in world markets, prefer-
ably those “with a small number of
workers, high quality output, employees
receiving high income and with access
to raw materials at reasonable cost!” If
such plums are not to be had, apparently
Mr Komuro’s idea would be to get into
sheltered industries where imports posed
no threat. At least he has yet to learn
that the latter are seen by locals as their
own preserve, if not that few of the
former exist.
So while Japan is in a hurry to get
aboard the Australian investment bus for
minerals and rural industry destinations,
it doesn’t see any need to rush into
secondary industry here. And to be quite
frank, it seemed from what Dr Jur. H. A.
Wuttke from Germany had to say on
the European view, that Germany, at
any rate, is in no hurry either. He seem-
ed to focus more on the clouds than
blue sky and sun in the climate for over-
seas investors here and, as proof that
this view prevails widely in Europe, the
present flow of capital from there is a
mere trickle.
On the score of attractiveness he men-
tioned several favorable factors such
as political stability, absence of restric-
tions on overseas remittances, our rela-
tively low income tax (a double taxation
agreement is needed to make this ad-
vantage pay off for German investors,
he said), our high standard of living,
widely diversified consumers’ demand
and big per-capita GNP compared with
Europe (£550 in Holland, £7OO in Brit-
ain, £750 France and West Germany
and about £930 in Australia). Also, in
a well-educated country like this, “the
foreign investor knows, when imparting
his know-how, he does not have to begin
with the elementaries.” Finally, our high
growth rate speaks its own message to
overseas investors.
\ gainst all this, Europeans see a num-
ber of problems in investing here
and we are indebted to Dr Wuttke for
being so frank about them. For instance,
continental Europeans wonder whether a
continent like Australia is able to digest
further considerable foreign investments.
Also, investments have as their main
object the production of more goods
and would only be justified if the over-
all demand in the economy is strong
enough; in other words, if there is still
a market sufficiently receptive for such
goods. The opinion is quite frequently
held in Germany that the investment
fields in Australia are as good as “grazed
down” on account of the substantial
foreign investments which have already
taken place. So, Dr Wuttke is inclined
to expect greater initial difficulties in
Australia, where competitors are already
established, than in countries where the
ground has to be newly broken.
In Europe, he said, you quite often
hear business people say: “In Australia
foreign companies are already engaged
in a big way in such industries as metal
working, foundries, engineering, electri-
cal equipment, rubber, plastics, paper
and textiles, food, drink and tobacco.
What, then, is left for us? Shall we not
risk ill-investment?” And again they ask
would they be at all welcome consider-
ing that other foreign countries already
account for 30 p.c. of the total net
volume of new investments in Australia?
Europeans realise that this is already
criticised in Australia as possibly an ex-
cessive foreign influence. Also, he
pointed out, labor is known to be short
in supply (as we know only too well)
and the wage level is high; while as to
the economic situation, people in Eur-
ope are still wondering about the devel-
opment of exports and certain risks in-
volved there. Further, people in Europe
are aware that Australia and her fast-
growing economy are vulnerable to cyc-
lical fluctuations.
DR H. A. WUTTKE
On balance, however, Dr Wuttke
thinks the theory or prejudice that
opportunities for investing in Australia
have already been exhausted by other
foreigners is defeated alone by the fact
that the inflow of foreign capital tends
to be high.
As more capital and know-how from
European firms came to Australia, - he
thought the scope of industrial develop-
ment will become more vivid. “The ver-
tical set-up of your industries will adjust
itself better with the horizontal range
which would become more widely spread
out. Such a trend would simultaneously
also increase the industrial share in your
overall economy and particularly in your
export trade. This will make you more
independent and will help you to protect
your economy against too violent fluctu-
ations. A rising volume of export sales
by strongly capitalised and highly mod-
ernised Australian industries will also
be a help.”
The speaker from Britain, Mr Michael
Shanks, spent rather a lot of his time
talking about what is good for us and
not so much about why we were an
attractive field for British capital. Unlike
other speakers he rather played down
the success of overseas investment here
in the past as a bait for new investment.
It could be gathered, though, that, as
also stressed by other visitors, the main
basis of our attraction for direct invest-
ment was the absence of restrictions on
overseas investment here. Again, refer-
ring to direct investment, “you cannot
try to compel overseas investors to share
ownership and control of their enter-
prises without damaging your prospects
of attracting the sort of investment you
want.”
As for porfolio investment from Bri-
tain, which he expects to rise, Mr
Shanks was not particularly excited by
yields here. He thought the equity mar-
ket in “named” stocks uncomfortably
narrow, that it is difficult to buy stocks
outside the thirty or so big names and
to get information on second line stocks.
When he said rather unkindly that “at
present you have, as you know, no gilt-
edged market as we know it” and that
we would get more portfolio investment
from Britain “if the Australian capital
market could be expanded”, it was a
shock to those who have been saying the
capital market here, even on overseas
comparisons, is both substantial and
sophisticated.
Enlarging on Mr Shanks’ remark that
in present circumstances sterling
couldn’t be sustained in its international
role if substantial sterling balances were
converted, Mr H. McE. Scambler, gen-
eral manager of the ES & A, drew the
conclusion that part of our attractiveness
to the UK investor is that, in a sterling
area country, investment from the UK
can be paid for in sterling, whereas UK
investment in North America, say, in-
volves drawing on the UK’s dollar
balances. He mentioned in passing that,
because of the generally favorable US
view of Australia, it is possible for UK
companies operating here to obtain sub-
stantial dollar loans to help their capital
development programmes in Australia.


Concourse of Sweet Sounds
A heyday for musical instruments
11/|us!C is becoming economically fash-
-4 ionable in Australia today. Thanks
to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Peter
Paul and Mary, and other rockers and
folkies, there is a tremendous public
thirT for guitars and drums. Thanks to
musical education in schools, pianos,
woodwinds and brass instruments are
growing more popular every day.
These are not the only reasons,
though. You can include in the list: later
hotel closing hours (excluding Victoria,
of course), the increasing popularity of
clubs, a growing demand for entertain-
ment, and the retailer’s friend (when
the purchaser doesn't bite the hand that
finances him), hire purchase.
All these factors added together have
given musical instrument retailers their
best-ever sales for years. Estimates of
the growth in sales in the last 18
months range from 10 p.c. to 15 p.c.
None of the retailers The Bulletin
spoke to can see any reason for sales
not going further ahead.
Most of our musical instruments are
imported. Those locally manufactured
include pianos (mainly by Beales, a
member-company of the Music Houses
of Australia group), guitars (ranging
through standard and classical to the
highly priced electric), drums in a small
way and some woodwinds.
Imports of electric guitars, for in-
stance, have risen from 38,709 in 1961-
62 to 55,82 S in 1963-64. Over the same
period, imported wind instruments have
grown from 41,962 to 59,823. This is
a trend in which musical instrument re-
tailers can see only advance. For as long
as there are groups like the Beatles, sales
will progress.
A spokesman for Nicholson’s Pty
Ltd said his company's sales had risen
by 10 p.c. in the last 12 months. “This
has been partly due to the rock and
roll groups which have played a big
part in pushing our sales along, par-
ticularly of guitars and dryms. The teen-
ager is interested in rhythm, not melody.
Another factor has been the later closing
of hotels in NSW and the patrons' de-
mand for music and entertainment
while they drink.
“In NSW also, a big feature of our
increased sales has been the inclusion
of music as an examination subject and
the Education Department’s drive to
have music taught in all schools.”
NSW is the only State employing full-
time specialist teachers in public, or
free, schools. This has come about only
' over the last ten years. In the early
1950 s the Education Department’s fin-
ancial contributions toward school
music were negligible. Now it is spend-
ing tens of thousands of pounds op in-
struments, sheet music, song books and
so on for primary and secondary
schools.
In the Sydney metropolitan area
there are 31 school orchestras with an
average strength of 25 to 30. One
school, Hornsby Girls’ High, boasts a
60-member orchestra.
The Nicholson’s spokesman con-
tinued: “Biggest of our sellers is the re-
corder. It’s a low-cosi basic sort of in-
strument which finds its way into more
schools every year. The children learn
the rudiments of music, the scales and
so on, on this instrument and then pro-
gress to other woodwinds, strings or
piano.
“Undoubtedly next on i?i,e list of big-
gest sellers is the guitar in all its forms.
Starting with the standard guitar which
costs from £5 to £4O, we go to the
classical Andres Segovia-type guitar
which costs £l5 to £2OO, and then to
the electric guitar which costs from £25
to £3OO. There is a strong demand for
all types.
“Aspiring electric guitarists will learn
the chords and fingering on a cheaper
model and gradually progress through
the ranks to the highly priced, highly
sophisticated electric models. And once
they buy an electric guitar the spending
has only just started. First of all the
guitarist will need an amplifier, another
£6O to £3OO. Then he might want a
reverberator and maybe an echo mach-
ine. By the time he's finished he’ll have
spent anything up to £7OO or £BOO.
“Enlarge this into a group and the bill
comes to between £l5OO and £2OOO.
Even there it doesn't stop. The group,
if it is successful, will have to buy sheet
music, new strings, new skins for the
drums, and so on.
“So you can see it's not a cheap pro-
cess to get a group going. Hire purchase
has helped a lot. For a relatively low
down-payment a group can get started
and pay as it plays. And they’re earning
big money today, so it's not a back-
breaking task to pay the instruments
off. The failure rate is negligible.
“The piano is still as popular as it
ever was and is finding its way into
more homes every day. One man told
me recently he had to make an appoint-
ment to play his own piano, so popular
was it with his family. Since a piano is
a pricey instrument too, most retailers
run a sort of lend-lease scheme. On our
scheme, for £lO down and £1 a week a
person can have a piano in his home.
“If the customer finds that he doesn’t
want the piano after a while he can
return it. If he wants to keep it he can
pay it oft’. This has saved a lot of trouble
where, say, parents have found their
child is not as musically minded as they
thought he was, or where the interest
has worn off.”
An executive of another Sydney in-
strument retailer said the electronic
organ was rapidly gaining as much
popularity as it has in America. “It’s
finding its way into churches, schools
and homes. Prices range from £4OO to
£2500. It is also being widely used by
entertainers. Most of them are imported
from England, although some Japanese
organs (and pianos) are finding their way
into Australia.”

FRY, Susan. Wile of RICHARD JOHN FRY, who died
on 19th October, 1953, and to whom the said SUSAN FRY
was married on 10th October, 1917, at St. Kilda, Victoria.
Daughter of ELLEN WILLS and ALBERT JOHNSON. Last

music is due to a do-it-yourself trend.
“When television started in this coun-
try sales of musical instruments fell off
sharply. However, over the last three or
four years, people have got sick of
seeing other people do what they
want to and they've taken up music.
They’ve found it an excellent way to
escape from ever-increasing tension and
the fast pace at which we live today.
“People are rapidly becoming part of
music rather than just listeners. And it’s
applying to all age groups, not just the
teenagers, and to all types of instru-
ments. Take, for instance, the recorder
movement. Dr Carl Dolmetsch, himself
a recorder manufacturer, has been
playing to packed houses in Sydney.
Most of the audience has been people
who are learning or who have learned
the recorder and want to pick up the
finer points. They're doing instead of
listening.
“This is happening at the same time
as kids are listening to rock and roll.
There’s room for all types of music.
Another factor in the growing sales of
instruments has been a change in
methods of learning to play There are
new - and more modern methods of
teaching which make it easier to nlav
an instrument. Changes in the popular-
ity of certain types of music count too.
The guitar came in in a big way with
rock and roll. Now you have folk sing-
ing which is giving additional impetus
to sales. The classical guitar, too, is
growing in favor. In the electronic
world there’s the Hammond organ,
which is very popular in homes. Easier
methods of learning here mean that the
person who is a mediocre player on,
say, the piano can sound like a concert
hall virtuoso on an organ.
“One instrument that is not very
popular at the moment is the violin. At
one stage every band had a violin, but
now it’s very hard to find one. The de-
mand for violins is coming mainly from
the symphony orchestras and schools.
People have lost interest in the violin,
probably because it is a difficult instru-
ment to learn.”
Another retailer said that not only were
sales of musical instruments going ahead
but also sheet music and records two
stocks-in-trade of instrument sellers.
“This move ahead has been helped by the
rock and roll groups and the folkies.
Groups who entertain in clubs have to
know the words, so they buy the sheet
music.
“Some people listen to the records
while they play to get the right technique.
But record sales are not confined only to
hit parade music. There is a steadily
rising demand for the more classical
records and the less noisy vocal arrange-
ments.
“One instrument we rarely see today is
the player-piano.”


Capturing Middle-Eastern Trade
Australia still misses many excellent chances
From RONALD ANDERSON in Beirut
around the eastern end of
the Mediterranean are twenty-odd
countries with a total population exceed-
ing 100 million. Some of these coun-
tries are desperately poor, some are rich
on oil, but all fall broadly into the
category of “developing” nations. They
lie in a great upended triangle, stretch-
ing from Greece east to the eastern
border of Iran and south to turbulent
Aden.
A few countries have infant semi-
industrial economies; others such scanty
natural resources that they cannot even
supply their own basic foodstuffs. Some,
like Greece, Turkey and the United
Arab Republic, have received substan-
tial foreign aid. A handful, such as
Kuwait, Iran, and Libya, have an almost
unlimited source of wealth in their oil-
fields. At varying rates, all 20 countries
are lifting the living standards of their
people and to do so they are becoming
bigger and bigger importers not only of
capital goods but of foodstuffs and many
consumer lines.
Australia’s share of this huge, difficult
but rapidly-growing market is a meagre
£2O million a year. Certainly this is a
vast improvement on our sales six or
seven years ago—we now have four
Trade Commissioner posts in the area —
and is rising slowly. But after talks
with importers, merchants, contractors,
government officials, shopkeepers and
Australian trade advisers during the last
few months in Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, the UAR, Turkey and Greece,
I am confident that our sales could be
boosted to at least £SO million a year.
Our trade with the area goes back 50
years, yet it is only in the last five years
that Australian exporters have begun
to pay the market anything like the
attention it deserves. This has been
largely the result of the Commonwealth
Department of Trade’s efforts—efforts
which are being sharpened this year with
a special series of three-day trade exhi-
bitions in Beirut, Benghazi, Tripoli and
Athens.
While the region must rank as one of
the world's most difficult trading areas,
Australia has one or two built-in advan-
tages as well as a whole range of dis-
advantages. Throughout the area many
importers and merchants show a marked
preference for Australian products
whenever they are comparable in price,
quality and availability. Thus Austra-
lia, if she can compete, stands a good
chance of taking a Middle Eastern
order, especially a government one,
ahead of countries with an “imperialist”
background.
In almost every one of the twenty
countries, however, we face stiff com-
petition from the Common Market
countries, Britain, Denmark, North
America. Eastern Europe and Japan.
In spite of the rapid growth of the
Australian Trade Commissioner service
in the last few years, Australia continues
to be heavily outnumbered in the East-
ern Medterranean and Middle East
and, generally speaking, it is the nations
with the most trade representatives w'ho
are winning most of the orders today.
Each Australian Trade Commissioner
may find ranged against him dozens of
compet ng trade counsellors and pro-
motion men.
In Beirut, for example, gateway not
only to prosperous Lebanon but to Iraq,
Syria and Jordan, a single Australian
Trade Commissioner finds himself out-
numbered by eight or nine Americans,
nine Britons, three Canadians, four
Frenchmen, four West Germans, seven
Danes and three or four Japanese, plus,
of course, scatterings of salesmen from
countries like Czechoslovakia, Argen-
tina, India, South Africa and Communist
China.
Australia’s sales in the region have
traditionally consisted of our long-
term exports wheat, flour, wool and
dairy products. These goods still
dominate, but each year manufactures
form a bigger proportion.
A glance at the biggest-selling Austra-
lian lines in a few of the more im-
portant countries is interesting:
Lebanon (wheat, cars, frozen mutton);
Jordan (wheat, cheese); United Arab
Republic (wheat, wool, frozen mutton);
Iraq (wheat, jarrah sleepers, wool, zinc);
Bahrein (flour, processed cheese, eggs,
butter); Kuwait (flour, processed cheese,
frozen mutton, live sheep); Saudi Arabia
(flour, wheat, processed cheese, bone-
less frozen beef); Sudan (corrugated iron
and galvanised iron); Turkey (wool,
rutile, metallurgical machinery); Greece
(meat, wool).
Our sales to Lebanon, the UAR, Iraq,
Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and, of
course, Turkey and Greece now all pass-
£l million in a normal year. But when
it is remembered that, of the 20 nations,
our sales to just three (Greece, Turkey,
the Lebanon) account for 65 p.c. of the
£2O million total, it will be seen there
is plenty of room for improvement.
The Persian Gulf is the glamor area,
though the Levant as a whole is re-
ceiving increased attention. An esti-
mated 300 to 400 Australian business-
men now visit Beirut alone each year.
Turkey, the biggest buyer in the region
of Australian goods, is by contrast
almost shunned by Australian manufac-
turers and exporters.
There is still a tendency for some
Australian firms to ignore the need to
tailor their goods to a market and to
back them with smart packaging and in-
telligent promotion. Those firms willing
to spend money on salesmen and pro-
motion have reaped the benefit. Kraft,
for example, has long held a strong
position in the processed cheese market.
The blue Kraft tin is so well known in
the Middle East that it has been copied
by many small local competitors.
General Motors-Holden is steadily lift-
ing sales, especially in Iraq, although
freight on its cars has risen from £9O to
£l3O in the last few years, cutting deal-
ers’ margins and making them less
enthusiastic about the Australian pro-
duct. Good promotion has greatly
helped McWilliams Wines take advan-
tage of a strong “snob” preference for
imported rather than the excellent local
wines in several countries.
There appears, too, to be a strong
possibility of Australia building a stable
market for meat in the region. For
three successive years Australia has held
the-contract to supply meat to the Jor-
dan Army—the former “Arab Legion”
of Glubb Pasha. The contract for 1965
is for 2000 tons of frozen mutton de-
livered in six shipments. And in the
Lebanon, which thrives on the tourist
trade, there is a_strong chance that Aus-
tralia will win contracts to supply-regu-
lar air-freight shipments of prime cuts
of meat to the hotel trade. As Beirut
alone has 45 first-class hotels, many of
them of v/orld class, this is a prestige
trdde not to be ignored, although the
profit margin may be slim.
But before Australia can make any
major break-through in trade in the area
it must solve several major problems.
Shipping is by far the most serious.
Beirut provides the outstanding example.
Australia now has a “regular” six-timcs-
a-year scheduled shipping service to
Beirut to service the Lebanon and its
neighboring countries. Yet last year
these ships actually berthed at Beirut
only twice. The vessels’ Beirut calls are
“subject to inducement”.
Thus Australian exporters and Leban-
ese importers have no idea when their
goods will arrive in Beirut. If the ship
does not carry sufficient cargo to “in-

duce” it to call at Beirut, all goods for
the Lebanon and beyond are transhipped
at Port Said, a port notorious for its
delays, damage and losses. Tranship-
ment does not harm some cargoes, but
in the Middle East it can be disastrous
for things like dairy foods, frozen meat,
flour in 1001 b. bags, wine and similar
products.
Our competitors can guarantee de-
livery from North America or Europe
within three weeks and even Japan can
land its goods in Beirut in from four to
six weeks. Australia’s normal delivery
time is eight to ten weeks and it is not
unusual for some cargoes to take four or
five months. These times do not, of
course, apply to wheat, which is nor-
mally carried direct by chartered vessels.
Thus, at present, a Middle East importer
ordering from Australia runs the risk
not only of a long delay before delivery
but of high freights and uncertain de-
livery date.
There is also the vexing issue of
availability. Many importers complain
to me that there was never any
certainty that Australian goods would
be available. Several importers said
they would gladly buy Australian steel
and tinplate, instead of competing lines
from our big rival Belgium. They
claimed, however, that Australian steel
and tinplate too often was not available,
or not in the quantities required.
Another importing and exporting firm,
which has sold £2O million worth of
Australian produce in the Middle East
in the past 15 years, said if could regu-
larly sell 10,000 tons of Australian rice
annually. It had been able to obtain
Australian rice only once or twice and
not at all in recent years. It had been
told that Australia only had enough for
its “regular” customers.
“Lebanon would be a regular custo-
mer too ... if you gave us the chance,”
the manager of the firm said. “Your
short-grain rice is very like the Egyptian
grain we usually eat and is very popular
here . . . when we can get it!”
Yet another firm had a complaint
heard in the past but now fortunately
rare. Having a buyer for a shipment
of raw cattle hides, the importing firm
contacted an Australian exporter for a
quotation. Two cables and a letter
failed to bring any reply from the Aus-
tralian firm. The importer still does not
know why.
A big firm with a chain of supermarkets
throughout the Middle East and
a huge food contracting business with
oil companies said it bought frozen
meat, eggs and dairy products from Aus-
tralia. But it would not dream of buy-
ing Australian tinned foods. “The qual-
ity is quite good, but your stuff just
does not have the eye appeal for super-
markets,” the manager said. The same
firm complained that mutton available
from Australia was too fatty for Middle
Eastern tastes. “Our fat-tailed sheep
have lean meat. We would like to buy
your No. 4 grade mutton, but it is not
available for export.”
Several Middle Eastern egg importing
firms registered the same complaint—
the folly of Australian State egg market-
ing boards competing amongst them-
selves in the export field. A typical
complaint: “If I buy eggs from Austra-
lia, if I spend my money promoting
them as Australian eggs, and if I take
care to sell only good fresh eggs . . .
then I expect exclusive rights in my
area. But today if I buy from the West
Australian board as a regular customer
I am likely to find that a rival merchant
has picked up the odd 1000 cases, say
from Victoria, kept them until half are
rotten, and then dumped them cheaply
—ruining the name of Australian eggs
and hurting my business. Surely your
egg boards can get together and allo-
cate export zones so that they do not
cut each other's prices and sell to each
other’s customers?”
Not a new complaint, of course, and
a problem which some of the egg boards
have been trying to overcome for years.
There is a widespread demand
throughout the region for better promo-
tion of Australian goods. Merchants
interested in handling our products say
business would be greatly expanded if
Australian manufacturers played a big-
ger role in promotion and if Australia
did more in the way of permanent trade
displays in centres such as Beirut, and
in consumer advertising, especially on
cinema screens and television. Of
course, more Australian manufacturers
and exporters should visit the region to
see for themselves the potential of the
market and the type of goods required.
In the Middle East more than in most
trade areas the choice of an agent can
be all-important. A few Australian
firms have suffered through operating at
long-range through unreliable agents.
Fortunately the five Australian Trade
Commissioners now operating in the
region are available to put Australian
firms in touch with reputable agents.

Highly Competitive Business
So stockbrokers seek efficiency
\S7hen Mr S. C. G. Macindoe was
putting the stock exchanges through
his mill at the Melbourne investment
symposium he failed to grind them on
the charge of monopoly. For as Mr
C. T. Looker pointed out, “the exchange
is not monopolistic in the sense that it,
and it alone, has any legal right to con-
duct a market place for securities”, a
point which the promoters of the pro-
posed rival Canberra exchange want to
drive home to the present exchanges’
discomfort. It is always open to others
to try to do .the job cheaper and better.
Nor must it be forgotten that, for all
the fixity of commission scales, stock-
broking is a highly competitive business,
not only between individual brokers on
the same exchange but also between the
interstate exchanges. It might be
imagined, for instance, that the first
exchange to get a computer working,
which is Sydney in fact, would have a
better pull on business than the others.
For any particular exchange or broker
it is the volume of business commanded,
perhaps more than the established scale
of commissions, that counts. Equally
the surest route to lower commissions is
via higher turnovers.
The question of stock exchange and
brokers’ efficiency is all important. It
is for this reason Mr A. H. Urquhart
told us he foresaw the extinction of the
sole trader, who is apt to be left behind
in the efficiency race, simply because he
cannot give the streamlined services now
demanded by the public and the institu-
tional investor, and is reluctant to fork
out his contribution to build new ex-
changes, install computers and the like.
True, unless the sole trader gets on the
underwriting bandwaggon and otherwise
spreads his interests, he cannot expect
to survive. And, in fact, it is these people
who depend on high commissions to
make their low turnovers a business
proposition. In that sense the sole trader
presents an obstacle to the reduction in
commissions.
However, sole traders can spread their
wings and this exemplifies the scope for
enterprise in the stockbroking profession.
It is apt to be forgotten that Australia’s
two leading underwriting firms were
once sole traders. People in Melbourne
still recall the days in the 1930 s when
Sir lan Potter was one, and it is only
eight years since A. C. Goode set up
business as a sole trader, albeit with a
weight of experience as a senior member
of J. B. Were and Sons behind him. Last
year there was not much between Goodes
and Potters at the top of the under-
writing league.
Profit Jumps 300 p.c.
/General Industries Ltd, stove and
” appliance manufacturer, lifted profit
nearly 300 p.c. in the year to December
31. It’s been a long road from the crash
the company suffered in 1961 when if
lost £484,929, but improvements each
year have seen the shares creep closer to
their par value of 20s. Latest price is
14S. -at
Profit for 1964 rose from £167,497 to
£476,231 and improved earning rate
from 3.2 p.c. to 11.5 p.c. As a result
dividend is lifted from 2i p.c. to 5 p c.
Profit remained after tax of £61,394
(previous provision £46,954) which in-
cludes a special provision of £30,000.
Depreciation allowance at £410,762 is
£31,577 higher than the previous amount.
Chairman of directors John Clarkson
in his annual statement attributes the
profit (a record) to increasing acceptance
of Metters’ stoves, baths, sanitaryware
and other appliances, higher sales of

Metters’ soil pipe and agricultural pro-
ducts, continued expansion of sales of
other products of the group, cost savings
from reorganisation, buoyant conditions
in the building industry and a successful
export drive.
Mr Clarkson said the low tax allow-
ance was due to tax loss benefits “which
still continue to be available. It has
been considered prudent, however, to
create this year the special provision of
£30,000”. He said the favorable trading
conditions the company experienced
during 1964 had continued into the
current year.
The company has redeemed £449,000
of the £lm. 8 p.c. registered unsecured
notes on issue which fall due for pay-
ment on August 12 this year. The offer
to redeem these notes for cash at their
par value with interest to date is still
open to noteholders.
Still Below Par
Shares of Australian National In-
dustries late last year got their first
look over par with a price of ss. 3d.
and started off the New Year with a sale
at ss. 2d. Things looked good to in-
vestors who had faith in the company’s
ability to recover, but now the shares
have drooped to 4s. lOd. Even the news
that (after adjustments for the cessation
of activities in two fields in which ANI
was engaged) sales for the December
half-year increased by 25 p.c. failed to
impress the market.
The operations closed down during
the year were motor retailing (investors
must be wondering what would have
happened if ANI remained in this busi-
ness!) and scrap processing. In their
interim report directors say they antici-
pate the trend of increased sales will
continue.
Profits have increased in line with
sales and this improvement is expected
to be maintained during the current half
year. Results for the full financial year
should show a substantial improvement
after allowing for higher taxation and
liquidation expenses, incurred in closing
down the motor and scrap sections of the
business.
Last full year’s profit improved by
41.4 p.c. to £274,516 to equal 10.8 p.c.
earning rate. For the latest period a 3
p.c. interim dividend is to be paid, in-
dicating continuance of the 6 p.c. rate
paid for the last two years.
Island Idyll
ML R. Carpenter Holdings Ltd,
merchant, island trader and investor,
reports higher earnings from all i f s
activities, except cocoa, in the December
half year. While prices for copra rose,
the cocoa price subsided to 1961-62
levels.
In the interim report directors say
group merchandise sales have shown
satisfactory increases. Copra mills have
operated to full capacity and estate pro-
duction has been satisfactory and in
keeping with budget. All subsidiaries
contributed adequately to group earn-
ings.
In Australia all divisions of Claude
Neon Industries lifted sales and produc-
tion, while Consolidated Neon Ltd main-
tained activities during the half year
compared with the previous correspond-
ing period. Southern Pacific Insurance
Co. Ltd, a listed company, maintained
business and premium income rose.
Directors have declared a steady 71

Carpark Corner
of commercial genius, this also
seems to be the gift of Melbourne's
carpark king, Mr J. W. B. King in fact,
who has managed to corner most of the
best business in the city. Unhappily,
though, for shareholders of Kings Park-
ade Ltd, of which he is managing director
and which up to June last year had accu-
mulated losses of £11,599, some of his
best sweepings remain outside the orbit of
the company. For instance, there is the
wide and usually full space at the
National Gallery site and now the brand-
new car park arena Ve controls at the
National Mutual centre in Collins Street.
Being right in the heart of the business
centre the latter is bound to prove
another winner.
True enough, Kings Parkade has a
fairly promising future both from its top
Little Collins Street carpark and rentals
from the storeys built somewhat as an
afterthought and not without some pains
above it. How much happier the prospect
would be with all those other corners in
Melbourne inside its circle also!
We learn, however, that there are
American rivals about to acquire these
private interests of Mr King and the
Yankee money is literally breathing down
his neck. If ever there was a case for
r esi: ting a foreign takeover this seems to
be it. Mr McEwen would certainly
approve. So would Kings Parkade share-
holders especially if all their managing
directors' carparks were brought into
their fold. In all the circumstances the
cost would probably be pretty high.
Grace Abounding
Qydney-rased retailer Grace Bros Hold-
ings Ltd lifted sales and profit in
the half-year to December at a faster
rate than in the previous corresponding
period.
Chairman Mr B. A. Grace said in his
interim report that all the company’s
retail outlets traded satisfactorily. In
the removal and storage division steady
progress was maintained, including the
newly-acquired interstate subsidiaries.

Shine Off Leather
nT'HE first Australian public company to
•*" report the effect of the UK Govern-
ment’s imposition of a 15 p.c. surcharge
on imports of manufactured goods is
Sydney-based tanner J. Bayley and Sons
Ltd. In an interim announcement direc-
tors say turnover of the parent company
was down 4.7 p.c. because of the sur-
charge and because of continued imports
of European leather into Australia.
The results of subsidiaries, particularly
James Munday and Co. Pty, continued
to increase. Exports of hides and skins
also rose. However, unless the 15 p.c.
surcharge is “substantially” reduced and
if imports of European leathers continue,
the group’s full-year earnings could be
affected.
Otherwise, say directors, earnings
should be maintained in view of recent
increased activity in leather. Interim
dividend is steady at 5 p.c. Last year
it was followed with a final 74 p.c.
J. Bayley’s interim report was re-
leased a few hours .before the news
reached Australia of the British Govern-
ment’s decision to cut 5 p.c. off the sur-
charge, so investors were cautious of the
pricing of the company’s’ ss. shares,
marking them up Id. to 10s. 3d.
Chairman and joint managing director
of J. Bayley, Mr W. C. Anderson, told
The Bulletin he was pleased with the
decision to reduce the surcharge. “It will
make a marked difference to business
now that orders from England are
coming in, but we still have the problem
of European leather imports to contend
with,” he said.
Stainless Profit
i”|NE of the first public companies to
report on its full year to December
31 is Bryant Bros (Holdings) Ltd,
stainless steel products maker. In their
preliminary announcement, directors
say profit rose 20 p.c. to £66,214 a
record.
It remained after increasing the tax
provision from £36,063 to £52,692 and
depreciation from £7797 to £8904.
Earning rate moves up from 20.3 to
23.2 p.c. Directors put the significant
improvement down to a substantial in-
crease in sales. The result was achieved
despite higher tax and costs. Late last
year Bryant Bros merged with Mel-
bourne competitor James Bell Mach-
inery Holdings Ltd to form Bell Bry-
ant Ltd.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
An Effective Reorganisation
Brambles offers buying opportunities
In about a week’s time the rights
-*■ to Brambles Industries Ltd new
one-for-ten issue will be traded. Judging
by the current share price, these rights
should be worth about ss. and this
would mean that new shares can be
obtained for 17s. 6d. each. At this
price, the dividend yield will be 4.2 p.c.
and it would seem likely that the divi-
dend has the possibility of being covered
well over 1.5 times.
Last week, when writing about Mayne
Nickless, I pointed out that the shares
of that company seemed rather high in
relation to Brambles, though they were
still not out of line with past prices
when the prospects of the company
seemed less bright than they do today.
So far as prospects are concerned, the
last interim report of Brambles would
suggest that the future seems rather
bright for that company too. It may
well be, then, that Brambles’ shares are
underpriced at the moment and, with
the present state of the market, little
improvement can be expected until the
new issue closes in mid-April.
it may be pointed out that to show
the same dividend yield as Mayne Nick-
less’ shares. Brambles’ rights would cost
Bs. 6d. approximately, which is 70 p.c.
more than the probable price mentioned
above.
For those whose main concern is in-
vestment income, it is possible at pre-
sent prices—even after allowing for
brokerage—to obtain a 15 p.c. improve-
ment in dividend income by switching
from Mayne Nickless’ shares into Bram-
bles’ shares. The main consideration
would be whether Mayne Nickless’ divi-
dend will grow at a greater rate in the
future than Brambles’ dividend. Even
if it does, however, 15 p.c. is still a lot
of leeway to make up.
The original business of Brambles
goes back to the last century. It is now
just over ten years since the shares of
the public company which emerged from
this business were listed on the Sydney
Stock Exchange. Some considerable
developments have taken place even in
the last ten years. Today Brambles
supplies a number of services to industry
which are associated with transport. The
one move which was subsequently to
prove unsuccessful took place in mid-
-1958, when Brambles acquired Morison
and Bearby Ltd, after encountering con-
siderable opposition from some of the
major shareholders. Perhaps unfortun-
ately for Brambles, this particular move
seems to have triggered off a series of
acquisitions in the general engineering
field. This move into engineering per-
haps suggested part of a major plan to
combine some of the functions of
engineering and transport. It does seem
as though this has been achieved in a
small measure with W. G. Pickerell,
which manufactures the tankers used in
Brambles’ bulk liquid haulage division.
With the exception of James Tickle
and Sons and Brambles Engineering
(NQ), the engineering division which
had been built up from 1958 to 1960
by various take-overs has now been dis-
persed. The sale price of the valve
division of Morison and Bearby was
partly satisfied with the allotment to
Brambles of 300,000 Finance and
Guarantee Co.’s shares at 10s. per share.
It seems likely that the £50,000 written
off “Shares in listed companies” in
1963-64 could have related to this
investment, as Finance and Guarantee’s
shares are now selling at just above ss.
Other than this, the sale of the assets
of the engineering division seems to
have been made without any book loss
and the funds generated have certainly
been re-invested to advantage.
HThe final sentence of the half-yearly
A report for 1964-65 reads as follows:
“Your directors are most gratified that
Brambles is now receiving the benefits
of a major reorganisation initiated more
than two years ago.” It is possible to
judge (to some extent) how effective
this re-organisation has been by calcu-
lating the ratio of net profit before tax,
depreciation and debenture interest, but
excluding investment income to total
capital excluding investments. Over the
last three years the percentage has been
as follows:
1962 1963 1964
14.4 19.3 29.3
During this period, there has been
very little increase in capital employed,
but the net profit has been more than
doubled. So far as the current year is
concerned, it seems likely that this pro-
fit will show an increase of 25 p.c. over
the 1963-64 figure and will be at least
2i times greater than the 1961-62
figure. This certainly suggests that the
recovery is complete. It would be an
advantage to make a comparison be-
tween Mayne Nickless and Brambles in
respect of the ratio mentioned, but this
is difficult to do with confidence, because
both companies have acquired others
during the period. However, the figures
for Mayne Nickless would seem to be
as follows, after making some adjust-
ments:
1962 1963 1964
33.3 28.9 29.2
The fact that the two companies show
almost precisely the same ratio for 1963-
64 is probably a coincidence. The point
is made that, in 1963-64, Brambles had
probably recovered to normal profitabil-
ity levels.
The interim report now seems to in-
dicate that, in Brambles’ case, this ratio
will rise even more strongly in 1964-65.
If the profits for the second half of
1964-65 show the same increase over
the comparable period for 1963-64 as
did the first half, the rate will be close
to 40 p.c. Even if the second-half pro-
fit shows no increase at all over the
1963-64 figure, the rate will be around
34 p.c.
There seems little doubt that Brambles
has indeed benefited from the re-
organisation of two years ago or more.
It seems that profitability has now re-
turned to the 1959-60 levels prior to
the heavy investment in engineering. It
is perhaps doubtful whether the market
can be expected to price the stock, as
it did in those days, at 22 times earn-
ings. If it did, there is every possibility
that in seven months’ time the shares
would be selling at 28s. ex issue! !
Opportunities will certainly occur to
purchase the rights or shares on favor-
able terms during March. The price
would seem attractive up to 7s. 6d. for
the rights and 20s. for the shares ex
rights.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A Calculating Planner
Broken Hill South’s growth factor
TAespite the still happy price position
of its main products, lead, zinc and
silver, a first glance at Broken Hill
South Ltd’s balance sheet and the vast
amount shown against investments
absorbed gives some justification for
wondering whether the classification of
mining company is a misnomer. Such
a view is especially confirmed when the
investment breakdown is studied in the
consolidated accounts. This breakdown
is well worthy of detailing:
Shares in companies listed
on Stock Exchanges £2,521,477*
Shares, debentures, etc., in
other companies £8,425,229
Government and
municipal securities £ 21,424
Total: £10,968,130
(*Quoted market value £3,517,808.)
And issued capital is £6,112,500.
These facts become more than inter-
esting when comparison is made of in-
come derived from investments and divi-
dends paid. These respective figures
are:
The company was originally formed
in 1885 as Broken Hill South Silver
Mining Co. Ltd, with a capital of
£75,000. Eight years later a new com-
pany was registered with an authorised
capital of £200,000, paid capital being
£130,908. Reconstruction took place in
1918 and four fully paid 20s. shares for
each 20s. share in the old company were
issued. As capital in the old company was
now £200,000, all authorised capital in
the new company was issued. Incidentally
a final dividend of 6s. per share was also
paid by the old company. A slight
difference to the first dividend (in 1897)
of 6d.!
In November, 1936, the shares were
divided into ss. units and capital re-
mained constant until 1961-62. In May,
1959, the ss. units were again split, into
Is. units. The change of capital in
November, 1961, when a 4-for-l bonus
issue was made, saw the shares consoli-
dated once more into ss. units, while a
further £3,000.000 was raised by the
issue of 8,000,000 contributing ss. shares
(paid to 6d.) on a l-for-2 basis and at
2s. 6d. per share premium. These shares
' are now fully paid.
In 1944/45 a share exchange with
Zinc Corporation was made, whereby
BH South transferred to Zinc Corpora-
tion 242,945 20s. shares in BH Associa-
ted Smelters Pty Ltd and received in
exchange 36,018 £4 shares in Electroly-
tic Refining and Smelting Co. of Aust.
Pty Ltd; 25,000 20s. shares in Common-
wealth Aircraft Corp. P.ty Ltd, and
20,672 20s. shares in British Australian
Lead Mfrs Pty Ltd. BH South was already
a large shareholder in all three com-
panies; the acquisition of the Electrolytic
shares gave it a major holding. Ten years
later BH South (71 p.c.) joined Shell
(75 p.c.), North Broken Hill (71 p.c.)
and Western Mining Corporation (10
p.c.) in a joint oil exploration venture.
No leases were then held, but discussions
had taken place with the WA Govern-
ment. Whether anything further tran-
spired is not known.
What, however, was much more im-
portant was the sale in 1961 of Western
Aluminium NL [owned jointly by West-
ern Mining Corp. (77.78 p.c.), North BH
(11.11 p.c.) and BH South (11.11 p.c.)]
to the newly-formed Alcoa of Aust. Pty
Ltd. Alcoa is owned 51 p.c. by Alumi-
nium Company of America and 49 p.c.
by the three Australian companies,

interest in Western Aluminium
3,402,778, 486,111 and 486,111 Alcoa
shares respectively. At last balance
date BH South also held 3,663,889 Al-
coa shares of 20s. each, paid to 15s. 6d.
The company's holding is now 16.6 p.c.
Another very large project, which is
761 p.c. owned by BH South, is Cobar
Mines, a copper mine, in which venture
South was joined by Consolidated Zinc
Pty Ltd (233 p.c.). During the year a
further 1,931,086 20s. shares have been
acquired, making the company’s holding
3,347,811 shares.
Both of these vast projects are due to
assume full operations within the next
6-12 months. Profits accruing there-
from augur well for South’s future.
Since balance date a further 3s. per
share call has been paid on the
3,663,889 Alcoa shares, thus making
them 18s. 6d. paid, while a 173 p.c. hold-
ing has been acquired in Beach Petro-
leum.
All the above information when ..cor-
related reveals a state of increasing
strength. It should not be overlooked, as
well, that the company is constantly
building on the existing structure —not
haphazardly but by carefully calculated,
long-term plans. From this viewpoint
alone it could well be that BH South
must be considered one of the leading
growth stocks in Australia. This being
so the shares at about 225. 6d., yielding
4.4 p.c., are far from being overpriced.
The careful investor is one prepared to
buy and hold.
NOCK AND KIRBY LTD
No Rapid Improvement
“Profitable operations by the furni-
ture retailing subsidiary, Beard
Watson and Co. Ltd, made all the differ-
ence to the trading operations of Nock
and Kirby Ltd in the 1963-64 financial
year.
In the previous year, when Beard
Watson incurred a £6532 loss, group
profit failed to cover the reduced divi-
dend distribution. But in the latest
year to August 31, Beard Watson
showed a profit of £32,551 —a turn-
round of almost £40,000 —and group
profit as a result rose from £21,679 to
£100,033, equal to 8.9 p.c. on capital.
Despite the improvement, directors
maintained a conservative approach to
dividend payment, holding the distribu-
tion at 5 p.c.
Nock and Kirby Ltd began as a build-
ers’ hardware retailer in George Street,
Sydney, in 1906 but did not join the
Stock Exchange lists until after a place-
ment of 10s. shares at 15s. in 1955.
Paid-up capital at this stage was
£400,000.
Since then capital increases have been
fairly rapid. Shareholders participated
in a one-for-four issue at par in 1958
and a one-for-eight, also at par, in 1960.
In addition, issues for takeovers, in-
cluding 714,530 shares for Beard Wat-
son in 1959, have lifted paid capital to
the present £1,119,860.
Prior to the Beard Watson acquisition,
profit had shown a steadily rising trend
and dividend each year was held at 10
p.c. However, with the effect of the
credit squeeze making itself felt, Beard
Watson became a millstone around the
group’s neck. Write-down of stocks
affected group figures in both 1961 and
1963.
On a number of occasions, including
the latest year, the chairman, Sir Nor-
man Nock, has drawn attention to the
heavy burden imposed on the group,
and other retailers, in the form of land
tax and rates and taxes generally, which
bear no relation to turnover or profita-
bility.
In fact, in the latest year, land tax
paid by the group represented 3 p.c. of
the total collections in New South Wales
and was equal to a dividend of about
11 p.c. on paid capital.
The main store in George Street is
only one block away from the -Beard
Watson outlet. At one stage directors
were giving serious consideration to
placing the latter on the market.
However, aided by moves to the
suburbs, the immediate crisis seems to
be past. Although the Beard Watson
site may well still be for sale at a price,
the figure is almost certainly consider-
ably above that envisaged by directors
a year ago.
The company now sells through 17
retail outlets, including one in the New-
castle district, one in Penrith and two
in Wollongong. Financing of sales
within the group is handled by a wholly
owned subsidiary, while manufacturing
activities are conducted by Norlin Pro-
ducts Pty Ltd.
In addition, Nock and Kirby holds a
51 p.c. interest in Valor Co. of Austra-
lia Pty Ltd, making kerosene appliances,
and a similar holding in Highway De-

velopment Pty Ltd, a Victorian deve-
lopment and investment company.
In 1960, it took a 49 p.c. interest in
Outboard Marine Australia Pty Ltd,
though this was subsequently reduced to
25 p.c., with Outboard Marine Corpora-
tion of Canada holding the remainder.
This company distributes Johnson and
Evinrude outboard motors and Pioneer
chain saws.
The latest accounts show the com-
pany still relying fairly heavily on out-
side short-term borrowings. Deposits
appear in the books at £414,427, down
from £552,116 in the previous year. The
fall is matched, by a rise in overdraft
from £215,628' to £382,935. Trade
creditors are also up, from £567,260 to
£613,700.
Reflecting the increased business in
the past year, debtors at last balance
date stood at £1,677,734 (after deducting
income yet to mature of £130,676),
compared with £1,615,867 (£128,063)
in the previous year. Stock was up
slightly from £1,705,172 to £1,812,397.
The company has a heavy investment
in fixed assets, with freehold in the books
at £2,527,657 including £1,926,765 at
an undated valuation.
At present the shares are still lan-
guishing around 9s. 3d. to show a divi-
dend yield of 5.4 p.c. On last year's
performance they appear to be fully
priced. The chairman could not hold
olit hope of a rapid improvement in the
current year because of the incidence of
higher uncontrollable costs. Yet the
company has not taken recent develop-
ments in the retail trade quietly and has
moved aggressively into the re-
organising both the method of retailing
and the layout of its stores.
Another attractive feature is the
assets backing of 265. lOd. for each 10s.
share, based on book values. The re-
serve position is strong, with capital
reserves totalling £1,322,356—£202,496
more than the capital. The shares could
well prove a sound lock-away proposi-
tion.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
The Cruel Things of Life
After the glamorous symposium
Two unscheduled events occurred
-*■ while the investment symposium was
being held. One was early in the piece
when a Darwin stockbroker attending
this symposium was charged (but sub-
sequently cleared) with having in-
sufficient means of support! Is this a
sign of the times?
The other was the appearance of
Stanley Korman at the symposium itself.
Now that we're back to more earthy
matters like the stockmarket, it has be-
come necessary to adjust ourselves to
some of the cruel things in life.
Firstly, I reluctantly decided to sell
the 200 Eric White. The interim report
just out tells us of a slightly lower profit,
primarily due to establishment costs of
offices in Hong Kong and New Zealand.
Earning rate, however, is still in the
vicinity of 40 p.c. Against this trans-
action was marked a £4l loss.
My feeling of depression about Eric
White was partly relieved by the £l5
profit on the AAO contributing shares.
Just for one day the shares touched
2s. 9d. As this was the target set, I was
quite happy to proceed with the sale.
The final adjustment to the existing
portfolio was the addition of 100 Ander-
son Meat shares at 325. After that
excellent interim report in January the
shares rose to 345., but now have slid
back to 325. Following the split into ss.
units, it works out at a market price
of Bs. Not high for a company that
could earn over 30 p.c. this year! The
shares are still cum the interim dividend.
The first new addition was 200 War-
burton Franki at 20s. It seems purely
lack of interest that has caused the shares
to drift down from a high of 225. 6d.
to the par value of 20s.
This is not the first time that the
electrical engineer and wholesaler has
been in the portfolio. After scraping
through 1961 with a small profit, earn-
ings started to move up quite nicely.
Then came 1964, when earning rate fell
away from 12.5 p.c. to 7.9 p.c. and
dividend was cut from 10 p.c. to 8.75
p.c.
Aj. was expected, sales rose in that
year but unexpected technical problems
were encountered in the Chatswood
factory. So much so, that without these
problems the chairman estimated that
group profits “would have exceeded
those of the previous year”. In this same
address, made in October, the chairman
stated that factory production has in-
creased to a “marked extent” and that
“indications” at present are for much
improved profits for the year”.
One other stock that caught my atten-
tion with its abrupt price fall was
Chemical Materials. The interim report
advising lower profits for the first half
of the current year was not surprising,
considering that the company had done
exceptionally well in the first six months
of the 1963-64 year. It was the second
half of that year that dragged the over-
all profits down.
As it seems likely that profits this year
will be in the vicinity of those last year,
and too harsh a view on the company is
being taken by the market, I'll watch
them for a while.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 A A Oil cfg, 2/9 £77
200 Eric White, 18/6 £lB2
BOUGHT
100 Anderson Meat, 32/- £163
200 Warburton Franki, 20/- £205
One good piece of news came when J
was reconciling the account with my
broker. I’d made no allowance for the
shorting of Mount Isa and Captain Pro-
ducts. So, in fact, I’d started this week
off with only a debit of £224 and ended
it up with a debit of all the threes
£333.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Battling Against the Rabbit
Need for a dogged leader
TI/anted: a champion to lead the fight
against the rabbit in Australia.
Preferably he should be a man of
substance, able to spare time and money.
Certainly he should be removed from
the tedium of an everyday job or any
occupation in which governmental or
public service pressures can be exerted
(and private enterprise pressures also).
A big grazier with a property that can
be left in the hands of managers would
seem an ideal choice.
What could such a champion achieve?
If he is outspoken enough, and dedicated
enough, he just might be able to bring
the rabbit in Australia under a degree
of control which would approach total
eradication. He would derive much
personal satisfaction. If he got a
knighthood out of it he would deserve
it.
‘His first task would be to unravel the
maze of rabbit control regulations at
present in existence. They are as com-
plex as any rabbit warren.
Tor a long time now the public at
large has had a comfortable idea that
myxomatosis has reduced the rabbit
population to an insignificant number.
Such is far from the case. Myxo has
worked wonders—in a fluctuating sort
of way. Some years the kill is good; in
other years it is not. Much depends on
the yearly allocation by the CSIRO,
which developed myxo, to the campaign.
Right from the outset the CSIRO
made it quite clear that myxo could
never be the complete answer to the
rabbit. It must be followed up with
poisoning (1080 is the main ancillary
po ; son) and ripping of warrens. The
yearly allocation to myxo by the CSIRO
is governed by two factors: the total
funds available and the energy with
which various State rabbit control bodies
do the following up. New strains of myxo
have to be developed as rabbits develop
immunity to the existing ones. The
scientists never did propound niyxo as
a miracle “king hit” for rabbits, even
though the public gaily accepted it as
such.
The reason the rabbit is still a pest in
many areas of Australia can best be
understood by examining the control
framework. It is a little like an army in
wartime. At the broad base are im-
pressive laboratories, office buildings full
of trained personnel, and all manner of
charts, diagrams and programming data.
At the firing line, where it counts, there
is perhaps one bloke out in the middle
of a fifty-acre paddock. He’s dirty and
he’s thirsty. “Blast the rabbits,” he says.
“I’m for the pub.”
Then there is the matter of commer-
cial rabbit trapping. The idea that a
professional trapper is some old whisk-
ery geezer pushing a wheelbarrow
through the scrub and earning just
enough for tobacco and flour belongs
with the Henry Lawson era. Profes-
sional trappers today earn big money.
Skins bring from 3s. to 12s. a pound.
The prices obtainable for carcasses are
a bit obscure. But one rabbit freezing
works in the Riverina changed hands
recently for a reputed £27,000. The
plant alone would not have been worth
this. The value was in the trapping
rights on a number of properties in-
cluded in the deal.
This is where the control programmes
break down. Too many property own-
ers come to financial arrangements with
professional trappers. Perhaps they
should not be viewed too harshly. May-
be they are only leasing the place.
Maybe it is just too big and too rough
for them to handle the job of really
thinning out the bunnies. Better to get
a quid from the trapper and let him
go for his life. Naturally the trapper
“farms” his run. He wants plenty of
young rabbits coming along all the time.
Some idea of the money in the rabbit
game can be gauged from the figures of
skins exported. Over the last 10 years
it has ranged from £950,000 worth to
£1,700,000. That’s a lot of money
coming from a declared pest which is
supposed to be under firm control. It
does not include the value of skins and
carcasses used within Australia (some-
thing this writer has been unable to
ascertain despite repeated inquiries). But,
at a guess, a good proportion of the
“pet's food” sold on an ever-increasing
scale in Australia is rabbit (along with
kangaroo and horsemeat).
All farmer organisations in Australia
deplore the commercial trade in rabbits.
Real control, they say, will never be
obtained until the rabbit is “decommer-
cialised”. “Decommercialisation” (hor-
rible word that it is) is the method New
Zealand used to bring the rabbit under
estimated 90 p.c. effective control.
In New Zealand, as in Australia, there
will always be mountainous regions
where some rabbits will remain unmo-
lested. But in New Zealand’s farming
areas the rabbit has been just about
cleaned out. It was not done simply

all the year
.v * round
by declaring that trading in skins and
carcasses was prohibited by law. It
was phased out over a ten-year period
beginning in 1947.
Commercial freezing works were per-
mitted to continue but had to pay in-
creasingly heavy levies on carcasses.
They were told, quite plainly, that the
phasing out system had been brought in
so that they would have time to seek
alternative uses for their plants. Eventu-
ally many of these plants found they
could make more money out of the
European rabbits (“lapins”) than they
ever had out of the scrawny wild rab-
bits. “Lapins"’ are kept in cages and
reared pretty much like fowls. They
are not considered a threat because, if
they do happen to escape, they are
unable to thrive in the wilds.
In Australia we have a peculiar situ-
ation in which “lapins” are prohibited in
most States (NSW permitted them for
a while) and at the very same time
commercial trapping of wild rabbits con-
tinues on a big scale.
It is not quite as simple a matter as
it might look, however. There are some
people wffio argue that rabbits are more
economical converters of herbage than
sheep; that they provide more food and
by-product for their size than any other
animal; that it would be better to en-
courage large-scale commercial trapping
in some areas than to continue wfith
marginal sheep-raising. It is just pos-
sible to ' produce facts and figures to
support this theory. But it is even more
possible to produce facts and figures to
refute it.
Admitting that the rabbit is an effi-
cient converter doesn't alter the basic
contention that by eradicating rabbits
large areas would support more sheep
and more cattle. The value of the in-
crease in sheep and cattle would out-
weigh any value likely to be derived
from unrestricted rabbit raising.
For years now all farmer organisa-
tions have pressed for “decommercialisa-
tion”, yet, like the eradication cam-
paigns by myxo and 1080, this ebbs and
flows too. The reason is that such a
plan would have no chance whatsoever
of w'orking unless it was on an all-States
basis. How can you achieve that?
It seems rather difficult because rabbit
control is vested in each State w'ith
various destruction boards. The CSIRO
can recommend certain methods, it can
make important discoveries, but it can-
not enforce any action. Even the State
boards themselves are hamstrung in
many ways. The State Government can
allocate funds, though never enough to
employ a full-time army of controllers.
Eventually, when it gets out into the
dusty miles leading to nowhere, part-
time labor must be utilised. Sometimes
this labor force cares; mostly it doesn't
give two hoots whether the job is done
properly.
In theory, but only in theory, it is an
offence for a landowner to have rabbits
on his property. How in the world can
this be policed? It would need thou-
sands of officers to police this theoretical
law.
What happens, anyway, if a lazy, in-
different landowner has a property
swarming with rabbits and rabbit con-
trol officers move in and clean them
out for him at Government expense?
Nearby is a keen farmer who has really
been trying but who suffers from the
rabbits coming off the lazy neighbors
place. Should not the Government
money be spent cleaning up the keen
farmer’s property?
Some farmers believe that the job is
too big anyway; that rabbits will always
be a pest, and a source of added costs
to Australian primary industry. This
conflicts with the best scientific findings.
A couple of years ago the CSIRO and
the Federal Government brought a
noted American virologist, Dr Shope, to
Australia to look at the rabbit problem.
Shope’s verdict was that rabbits could
be brought under effective economic
control in pastoral areas, even though
some might always remain in remote
areas. He advocated myxomatosis plus
1080 poisoning and ripping.
In all State and Federal departments
connected with primary industry this view
is shared. It is shared also by all the
farmer organisations. What is missing
is someone with the drive and initiative
to make a really Australia-wide eradica-
tion programme function.
All the evidence points one way:
the rabbit can be beaten. It needs a
bold man—a champion—to take up the
cudgels without fear of being “shot at”.
He'll have to put up with plenty of
opposition and he will have to galvanise
the State and Federal Governments into
really tackling the rabbit problem on
a national front with “decommercialisa-
tion” an absolute must. He can be con-
fident that the vast majority of people
wiil be on his side—even if they find
that their own hands are tied.
Patience he will have to have too. If
bunny is light on in the brain depart-
ment, so are some humans.
This actually happened: in one State
it was found recently that a large nature
reserve was swarming with rabbits. The
reserve, although under Government
control, was administered by a commit-
tee of nature-loving citizens, respectable
people all. Most happened to be city
dwellers, which may have something to
do with it.
The obvious thing was to hop in and
clean out the rabbits with every con-
ceivable weapon. The place was crawl-
ing with them. But the committee of
nature-lovers would not have a bar of
that too cruel and too inhuman. It
took the best part of seven months for
the man in charge to convince them that
there are times when it is necessary to
be cruel to be kind. He had to argue
for hours at a time to convince them
that the food the rabbits were eating best
belonged to the native wildlife in the
reserve. In the meantime, wffiile all
this arguing w ; as going on, the rabbits
multiplied how many thousand times?

Omega Constellation. Requires no minding. Can be worn while swimming or golfing. The calendar feature is invaluable when dating letters and cheques.
As Illustrated. * In JBct. gold with 18ct. gold bracelet, £360.
Few men are destined to receive the new Constellation
-the finest Chronometer Omeera has ever made
Gravity-powered rotor winds the Constellation as you wear it. Pre-tested for 360 hours, in 5 wrist-positions,
the Constellation Chronometer is Omega’s finest watch . . . built for a lifetime of proud possession.
They make it with love. Ask Omega
craftsmen about the Constellation and
they will talk like proud parents.
Because they have an inborn love of
fine craftsmanship.
They gift it with accuracy. Skill and ex-
perience tell them that an error of no
more than one-ninth the diameter of a
hair can seriously affect accuracy and
durability. Therefore they work
and think -- in thousandths of mil-
limeters.
They endow it with long life. They know
that friction is the deadly enemy of
longevity. That high-speed metal-to-
metal contact can produce wear. That
one tiny particle of dust is dangerous
to a watch mechanism. Therefore they
polish the moving parts until they
gleam like mirrors. Furnish the watch
with jewelled bearings. “Scrub” the'
components ultrasonically and chem-
ically, 1215 times in all. Work in
spotless, hygienic surroundings.
They put it to the test. Each Constell-
ation must prove its accuracy during
360 hours in a Swiss Institute for
Official Chronometer Tests; it must
also receive a certificate endorsed
“Especially Good Results.” This is the
highest accuracy rating the Institute
can confer.
They place it in trustworthy hands. You
won’t find an Omega Constellation in
every jeweller’s shop. Its sale has been
entrusted only to jewellers who thor-
oughly understand and love watches.
The Omega jeweller is inspired by the
same pride and enthusiasm as the
Omega craftsman. That is why he
consistently recommends and sells
the Constellation.
They give it full after-care. There are
fully-equipped Omega Services Centres
in 156 countries. Wherever you go
they are within easy reach. Each
Centre is headed by a technician who is
Omega trained. The Omega one-year
International Guarantee is honoured
everywhere.
They remember it forever. Your Con-
stellation is linked to Omega craftsmen
by the number engraved on the move-
ment. They have lavished care on your
watch. They know that its accurate
heart will beat stoutly and surely. On
and on and on . . .
Some day you, too, will own an Omega.
