“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydnry, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
/ rentier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Une Ferson, one Vote.
Comnlete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
1 State monopoly.
Hie direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A n ® vv Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A I niversal ■ System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
1 he Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
t ian half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
Ihe Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in' which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured.' It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover us equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to anothej - .
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its. policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
* CORED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes*
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
t'j
\£
&
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and. sleep
like a child.” *

Outlaws Both.
(FOR THW BULLETIN.)
Steady; steady, my pearl; from the crest of the
range
One last look behind us : the roofs of the town
Are lit with the red fires that quiver and change
Where the sun in the westward goes royally
down:
Yonder light will return to the township again,
But we are oast out from the dwellings of men.
You —the pride of the paddock, the pick of the
yard.
The bold one that scorned to be bridled and
bound,
Whose mettle and swiftness shall now be my
guard,
Whose courage and confidence girdle me round :
I—who struck for my honour, as others can tell,
The blow that was given too straightly and well.
Outlaws both, you and I. Through the night and
the day
From red flush of dawning till rise of the moon
The sound of your hoof-beat shall echo away
By rock-ragged ranges and reedy lagoon,
And their steeds will be swift and their trackers
be keen
If we stand to their challenge, “In name of the
Queen.”
With our bed in the bluegrass, our tower on the
ridge,
Our kingdom the scrub-land from centre to sea,
The wild-fowl that sweep from the billabong edge
Are never so curbless of pinion as we.
With only the coast-line for bolts and for bars.
With our roof-beam the sky and our lamp-light
the stars.
Aye! they feared you of old time, the cravens that
passed
From the rails of the yard when the danger
began;
And now, should they follow, they’ll find at the
last
There is more to be feared from a desperate
man ;
And they’ll know by red spurs and by foam-
covered reins
They are riding the tracks of the Pride of the
Plains.
From the roofs of the township the sun-fire has
fled,
And the Night Queen will reign in her majesty
soon;
Shall life be less dear for the sunlight that’s dead ?
When the shadows are falling we’ll ride by the
moon;
And the limitless bush where the wild cattle roam
Shall lend to the outlaws a refuge and home.

Playing for safety. Mr. Cox: “John,
why do you call that pretty type-writer of yours

Ann.”— Judge. /
Colemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Pills stir one up.
A Pentridge prisoner recently lodged a
complaint against a warder for chronic and pre-
meditated insult evidently designed to provoke
him to violence. The official, he said, came to his
cell door every night and whistled through the
keyhole, “Oh, would I were a Bird.’’ Such a
tune would probably aggravate any average con-
fines to desperation, but a J.P. with no music in
his soul promptly gave him a spell of solitary con-
finement for making a frivolous complaint.

The Abqds jeering at the gew-gaws of constitu-

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the Joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with ia
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.
POST FREE TO ANY PART OF AUSTRALIA.
No matter how tar in the interior you reside, ELLIS S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands

avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S

cern " from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw” or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The following

SATURDAY, JUNE 23, 1894.
The Political Situation in N.S.W.
Since the New South Wales Parliament
practically gave up the ghost, a week ago,
the confusion of politics has assumed a more
aggravated form than ever before. The
situation has been sufficiently incomprehen-
sible for many months past, but now it has
resolved itself into heaving chaos and a
general disintegration of all things. Judging
from present indications, a thousand candi-
dates or so will go to the poll for 125 seats,
though considering how incessantly new
politicians are coming forward—most of them
“under extreme pressure”—the number
may ultimately approach two thousand or
more. The division of the province into
single electorates has upset all the ancient
landmarks, and the abolition of the property-
vote has shifted the balance of power, to a
great extent, from the metropolis to the
country districts. In addition to these changes,
parties have disintegrated badly since 1891,
and the results of all these new condi-
tions make the coming election the most
absolute game of chance that can be
imagined. No one can forecast the future
with even a semblance of certainty. The
result may be the return of the Dibbs
Government to power with a vast majority ;
or the establishment of a Rbid-M‘Millan
Cabinet; or the upheaval of an Andy Kelly
Ministry, which will signalise its accession to
office by taking Tommy Dodd out of gaol
and appointing him Agent-General, and by
sending Samuel Rosa to the Upper House.
Anything may be possible, so far as the pre-
sent evidence goes, and nothing seems to be
absolutely impossible.
• • •
In a contest where there is a steady
average of from five to twelve candidates for
each seat the probabilities are much the
same as if one threw from five to twelve
coppers at a ladder in the dark ; any one
copper has about as much chance of sticking
to the steps as the other. If public opinion
should find room to assert itself, however,
the prospects of the Labour-party look far
from brilliant. That party has had the evil
luck of late to be too much associated in the
popular mind with the Tommy Dodd ele-
ment, and ha&been too much advertised by
its own palt% internal dissensions and
the Active Service Brigade for its own good.
A horrible tendency to start small, foolish,
obscene, or hideously libellous papers has
manifested itself among the outer fringe of
the party, and large numbers of irrespon-
sible and unauthorised individuals have cursed
it with their support, and made wild state-
ments on its behalf in Sydney Domain and
elsewhere. Also, miscellaneous Anarchists
and other kinds of visionaries have associated
themselves with it, and have not been
thrown out with the vigour which the case
required. The riot and frenzy of the
famous Conference of last year covered the
cause with ridicule, and the practical division
of the party into two sections, each of which
has since been busy expelling the other
section, has gone far towards wrecking
it as a serious political force. Also, the
selection as candidates of Messrs. Slbath
and Ferguson, of Broken Hill, both newly
out of gaol, suggests either that the party is
woefully short of capable representatives, or
that it regards the mere circumstance of
having been in gaol as a special qualification.
The public, however, is apt to view the
matter in a different light. It is compara-
tively easy to keep out of gaol nowadays,
and the man who (even making all allow-
ances for a crooked trial) gets in there on
his very first public appearance, has not
intelligence enough to be a laW-maker, and
hardly rises above the stone-breaking level
of intellect.
* « *
All these things ought to utterly smash the
prospects of the Labour-party, were it not
that one of its rivals is worse, and the other
almost as badly situated as itself. The
Foreign-trade Opposition probably the
worst-disorganised of all the contending fac-
tions—has burst into three parts and seems
capable of bursting into several more. In
its present state it embodies the Reid-
M ‘Millan party ; the shadowy Wise party ;
and the small knot of irreconcileables under
Parkes, with whom the Wise clique is more
or less allied. All these parties are suffering
from a variety of disadvantages. No one
takes Reid seriously, not even himself ; no
one takes Wise seriously save himself ; and
no one takes Parkes seriously save his
creditors. The Foreign-traders had some
forty years of power, and left an unspeakably
poor record behind them, which record now
rises up against them like an accusing spirit,
and refuses to be laid. Two, at least, of the
three leaders have been making feeble bids
for the support of the Single-tax enthusiasts,
but their following includes almost all the
big land monopolists of the country, and to
commit themselves to the Single-tax means
practically an undertaking to confiscate all
the wealth of their own supporters. There-
fore, having committed themselves rather
recklessly when the election .was yet afar off,
they are now busy explaining away their
own utterances, and explaining them very
badly. Further, though calling themselves
Freetraders, none of them dare advocate
Freetrade, for that would necessitate the
levying of a stupendous land-tax to make up
for the lost Customs revepue, and all the
many landholders of the party would rise in
revolt at the idea of such sacrilege. - There-
fore, the alleged Freetrade party has no
policy to fall back on save the old Parkesian
revenue tariff, which takes as much from the
nation in duties as the present Protective
tariff, the only difference being that in the
Reid-M‘Millan system the duties are placed
where they can have no effect save to increase
the price of commodities, while on the Dibbs
system they are placed where they have
some chance of improving the industries of
the country. In other words, Protection
raises a of revenue and tries
to do some good by raising it, while Foreign-
trade raises the same revenue through the
same source, and tries to make dead sure
that it will do no good whatever.
• • •
Even these are not all the troubles of this
anomalous party, which calls itself Freetrade,
yet dare not propose to make trade free.
Parkes, the ancient Ishrnaelite of the cause,
is bitterly opposed to all the other leaders,
and he stumps the country at intervals
endeavouring to rouse the old Kiama spectre
which served him so well in days gonejby.
If that loathly goblin does rise it will be
Parkes’ own goblin, and no one knows with
any certainty to what use it will be put, it
being a spook which is liable to explode in
any direction. Further, Messrs. Want and
Bruce Smith, two of the leading supporters
of the shoddy cause, propose to retire from
politics, and their defection leaves a dismal
impression that they have lost faith in their
party’s fortunes. So the Freetrade vessel,
with its three captains and its seven or eight
first mates, goes pretty much where chance
directs or misdirects, and keeps no course in
particular.
# » #
The Protectionist party is the only one
which shows any genuine solidity, but it also
has its troubles, and they are many. In the
first place, the odds, at a general election,
are always against the Government provided
it has held office for any considerable time.
Its sins are, fresh in the public mind, while
those of the party which previously held
office are partly forgotten. Only once since
New South Wales had a Parliament has a
Ministry gone to the country after two years
of office and not been defeated, and then it
held on solely by a process of coalition ;
with purely party Governments the invari-
able rule has been that a dissolution and
a Ministerial collapse were practically
synonymous terms. Whether the Govern-
ment was good, bad, or indifferent it en-
countered the same fate; the fickle, shiftless,
unstable nation is always yearning to ex-
change the devil it had last for the devil
had the time before last. Also, the Dibbs
Government has had to face worse diffi-
culties than have fallen to the lot
of any other Cabinet in New South
Wales. It came into office just when
the bottom had practically fallen out of
the great Freetrade borrowing policy. It
could not bring back the glories of twenty
years ago ; neither Freetrade, nor Protec-
tion, nor Single-tax, nor Socialism, nor
Anarchy, nor Prohibition, nor Female
Suffrage, nor Federation, nor any other
nostrum under the sun could borrow and
spend over again those £56,000,000 of British
money which had been borrowed and
squandered in the past, nor sell over again
the forty-million acres which were sold in
the past. It assumed power just when the
great “drunk” was finished, and the awful
recovery had to be faced, and the conse-
quences of that defunct orgy are commonly
laid to its account. Also, though it has
been in the main a strong and tolerably
honest Government, as Governments go,
it has committed sundry glaring sins,
of which Dibbs’s despicable falling-away
into Imperialism is not the least. The
past two years of Protection—such Protec-
tion as it is—can certainly compare favour-
ably with the previous two years of Foreign-
trade. Food has been cheaper, despite the
fact that the importers’ organs proved dis-
tinctly that it must be dearer ; agriculture
has advanced enormously, and manufactures
have progressed steadily, and the country
has paid more of its enormous load of
interest out of revenue, and less out of
additional borrowings, than it did for many
years previously. Still, under ordinary cir-
cumstances, the prospects of the Govern-
ment ought to be about hopeless ; as it is
they are probably better than those of any
of its rivals.
« * •
The strangest possibility of all is that the
Protectionist, Foreign - trade and Labour
parties, also the Prohibitionists and the
Single-taxers, may all be defeated together.
Among the candidates there are sufficient
“independent” road-and-bridge men—
mostly aldermen—to make two Parliaments
instead of one. And, in the absolute im-
possibility of forecasting results amid so
many new conditions, it is just possible that
a majority of loose, unattached aldermen,
each pledged to the one enduring policy of
getting all the money he can for his own little
district, may be returned. New South Wales
is trying a great political experiment, and
how it will result no one knows till after the
event. The one thing that is certain is :
where manhood suffrage prevails the nation
can rely on getting exactly the kind of Par-
liament which it—or, at least, the male por-
tion of it—deserves, and if the men of New
South Wales deserve to have a Parliament
of aldermen they will get it. But if they do
get it, it will be a gruesome event. The
Bulletin would shed a tear over even
Sodom and Gomorrah under such circum-
stances.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Second Coming of Davies.
Matthew Davies, financier and boss Frefc.
mason, is said to have lately been the hero of a
little banquet at the Masonic Hall, Melbourne.
A number of Matthew’s most devoted fol-
lowers among the Craft considered that the
time was ripe for endorsing their high opinion
of the fallen chieftain’s public and private
character, to which great national end they
arranged a little fraternal festival, with Mat-
thew as the “ star ” guest. Although not an
official tribute of respect to the busted bank-
promoter, this was essentially a Masonic demon-
stration, and inasmuch as the brethren as-
sembled in the local temple of their faith, it
was practically the patronage of their high chief
cockalorum, the Prince of Wales. The dinner
afforded interesting evidence, at any rate, that
Matthew Davies’ relations with the Freehold
Investment Society and many similar scandals,
have not incurred Masonic censure. It may
even suggest a question as to the exact bearing
of Freemasonry upon the financial credit of
communities, and it certainly invites the remark
that no paragraph concerning Matthew’s glorifi-
cation appeared in the press. As a rule, the Craft
gives bold advertisement to its social events, yet
here was an instance in which the members of
the secret Tory organisation held an important
meeting on the quiet. For though ten thousand
initiated fat men may protest that the feasting
of Matthew by a clique of brethren had no
sort of Masonic significance, The Bulletin will
still call it an important chapter in a sad Vic-
torian story. The honoured guest having had
his business integrity and political services, as
an “ entertaining Speaker,” duly sworn to by
one brother, and lustily cheered by all the
brethren in unison, rose to return his heartfelt
thanks. And in returning thanks, Matthew
Davies delivered himself of a threat that should
make the pale blood of Victoria, not to mention
the gore of future British depositors, run cold
indeed. Notwithstanding his seeming condi-
tion of hopeless insolvency, his inability to meet
calls upon countless shares, and his apparent
want of means to earn a rich living, this obscure
lawyer observed—iso the story goes —that he
was now at the bottom, after being at the top,
of the tree, but he fully expected to get to the
top of the tree again (tremendous cheering by
the worthy Masons assembled).
British Pluck-—or Cheek.
Dear Bulletin, —You have made several allu-
sions to the backwardness of the “ native,”
and the forwardness of the “ newly-arrived ”
in the scramble for Parliamentary candidatures.
This is a melancholy fact, capable of infinite
proof. As a native I do not attribute it so
much to any exceptional modesty we may
possess, as to/the irivincible effrontery of the
expatriated Britisher. I have seen the latter
tied up in his native lair, and have also
observed him loose abroad, especially i n
countries—like India—where coloured races
have had the spirit knocked out of them by his
ancestors, and feel reluctantly compelled to
avow that I believe the contempt felt for all
“native races” by the itinerant Britisher is
extended to the native-born (though European-
descended) Australian. How else can we account
for this burning desire to govern the native in his
own country ? Here is an illustration of the
treatment of native races by the resident
Britisher, In Colombo (Ceylon), some three
years ago, I saw a.huge military officer being
taken down the street in a jinricksha, which, as
you know, is a light cab, drawn by a man
instead of a horse. The great, hulking officer
was dressed in white duck, and looked refresh-
ingly cool under his broad hat, as he lay back
and urged forward the sweating coolie through
the stagnant summer heat. When they reached
a corner where the officer wished to turn, he
leaned out and struck the coolie on the side of
the head with a stick to turn him round the
corner. The chances are that if this fellow and
his kind had bad the conquering of India to do,
it would never have been done. That instance
shows the spirit of contempt which per-
vades the bumptious Britisher. But see
how it works out here. An instance is handy
in the case of that distinguished foreigner,
Mr. Thomas Dodd. This gentleman found
himself cast ashore from a tramp-ship at Sydney
one morning, and almost before he had worn
out a pair of shoes on our sandstone pavements
he is found occupying as large a space in the
public gaze as Parkes —leads a great agitation,
dictates to public meetings who shall exercise
the assumed right of free speech, gags an ex-
Colonial Treasurer, hob-nobs with Reid and
Wise (and even M'Mxllan) in the lobby of
Parliament House, calls a member a liar from
the gallery, bosses two labour-league con-
ferences on a proxy nomination, runs a news-
paper, and finally—hallelujah ! —gets into gaol.
Is there another country in the world where this
could happen ? I confidently answer—Not one.
But this fallen star did not twinkle alone. SJ
remember the Jubilee year, when we had our
Republican demonstration in the Sydney Town
Hall, a newly-arrived gentleman named
Dowling attempted to quell the seething
Republicanism of that period by displaying
some fire-brigade or other medals on his
manly breast, and scowling at the Republicans
below from the safety of the elevated platform.
In the Parliamentary movement the foreigner
is well to the front —yes, front is an appropriate
word. The new-chum “has arrived” in that
much-vexed sphere. And the native politician
has to back down on his own dunghill and
yield the pride of place to the enterprising
emigrant. Yes—the Italian has collared the
fruit trade, the Chinkie the furniture business,
the Greek and the Italian share the fried-fish
industry, and the political platform has gone to
the Johnnie Raw of six months’ residence. I
don’t question the ability or the political
capacity of the inert native Australian. I only
ask whatan opinion the newly-arrived must have
of us when he sees how easy it is for him to get
into prominence? And though I should be
sorry to inaugurate a “ native ” cry, still I
think the time is pretty near when the Aus-
tralians of the soil should get a little closer to
one another. We have stood being governed
by the pioneers for a long time—and stood it
pretty meekly. But in the name of the sacred
kangaroo of our native land, are we going to be
for ever ruled by waifs and strays, and casual
wanderers from the British Islands?—Yours,
Cornstalk. /

The “Fount of Mercy” Again.
The erratic “ Fount of Mercy ” has decided on
the release of Bertrand, the most sensational
murderer in recent New South Wales history.
Bertrand, who escaped the gallows by a hair’s-
breadth, has now spent 29 years in gaol, and
for the greater part of that time a spasmodic
agitation for his liberation has been in progress.
This agitation has at last been successful; and,
as the law fully intended to hang him, and only
let him live owing to a series of accidents that
were beyond its control, the present decision
evidently implies that 29 years’ imprisonment is
fairly equivalent to the gallows. If it doesn’t
mean this then it means nothing in particular.
As a rule, however, the prisoner who is sen-
tenced for life gets out at the end of 15 or 20
years, so that, to all intents and purposes,
there is no life-sentence in Australia. The
release of Bertrand, like that of many
similar criminals, therefore, serves as a
specious, though hollow, argument on behalf of
capital punishment. When a man has com-
mitted a murder which has not even the
semblance of an extenuating circumstance, and
has thereby shown that he is a person who
cannot safely be left at laige, then the gallows
settles the question for ever. A sentence of
perpetual imprisonment would settle it equally
well, but the prisoner for life is always liable
to be released by an interfering Executive just
before a geheral election, so that the life-
sentence is really only a formality, and the
gallows is the only definite institution in the
criminal code. The argument, of course, is
hollow at the base. If Bertrand had been
duly and officially hanged, it naturally follows
that a cold-blooded and remorseless assassin
would not now be turned loose upon society.
Likewise, if Abigail, whose release after
serving less than half his short sentence—is
also pending, had been hanged, a cold-blooded
and dangerous humbug would have been put
past doing any further evil in this world. There-
fore, when these two miscarriages of justice
are placed side by side, the same argument
applies equally well in either case, and it is
either a good reason why the murderer and the
hypocritical swindler should be hanged together


or else it is no reason at all. Bertrand’s
release is no proof that capital punishment is
either moral or politic, but it is a good and
solid proof that the present erratic “Fount of
Mercy ” is a failure and wants to bo put on an
entirely new basis. The prerogative of mercy
should not be left in the hands of any set of
men who are subject to political pressure, whose
whole existence has to be spent in looking for
votes, in conciliating enemies, and keeping
square with supporters, and making friends
w ith the mammon of political unrighteousness
generally. The prospective release of a
prominent ex-politician who has a big hold
upon the sectarian vote in its most aggres-
sive form shouldn’t begin to leak out un-
accountably just before a general election;
and if a notorious murderer who has served 29
years in gaol, and a lot of “respectable” swindlers
who have served about 24 months, are to be
turned loose, there should be no possibility of
suspicion that one of them is set free in order
to draw public attention off the rest. The
whole prerogative of mercy, in short, wants to
be handed over to a Court of Appeal, which
will have power to consider all extenuating
circumstances of any kind whatsoever, and to
reduce sentences at its discretion. This Court
will probably have many of the faults of the
present superior criminal courts, but the Execu-
tive, in its judicial capacity, has all these faults
already and many others of its own besides.

The Profit of Sugar.
A Brisbane estimate sets the profits of current
Q. sugar season at £350,000, and the wages
paid at £850,000 —white, £400,000; coloured,
£300,000; shipping labour, £150,000. This
distorted view might have passed before the
Mackay co-operative mills showed how much
it cost to make a ton of sugar ; but it won’t do
now. North Eton sugar cost last year £8 ss.
per ton, and paid £3 ss. per ton nett profit.
Taking the season’s output at 94,000 tons, there
is at least £282,000 for miller’s profit at once.
Every mill in Q. can afford to pay 12s. per ton
for cane (Mackay mills paid 145.), which at 20
tons of cane to the acre (a low estimate, con-
sidering that scrub-land gives 40 to 60 tons)
shows a growers’ return of £l2 an acre. Put
the labour at half that (rather above the mark),
give 10 tons of cane to the ton of sugar (8J tons
at Mackay), and we get 47,000 acres of cane to
be cut, which at £6 per acre makes the
growers’ profit another £282,000. Probably
47,000 acres is an over-statement; but the
under-estimated cane-yield and sugar-product
will about balance it. Certainly the growers’
and millers’ nett profits cannot be set at less
than £550,000 ; or £250,000 above the Bris-
bane estimate. The amount paid to labour may
be taken as 94,000 tons at £8 ss. per ton, or
£775,000, less £282,000 grower’s profit ;
or £193,000 —a difference of £350,000 less
than the Brisbane estimate. Thus the
industry will not pay in wages, on the
most liberal basis, anything like what it returns
to the employers, who make over 100 per cent,
on the year’s operations. Put the capital
invested in land and mills at £2,000,000, and
charge it with 8 per cent, interest, and the
Queensland sugar-industry still yields a clear
20 per cent, all round. This is the lowest pos-
sible average estimate ; and where planters get
both a growing and a milling profit, and utilise
Kanaka labour fully, their return reaches as
high as 30 and 40 per cent.
“ Doubles."
It is now some considerable time since the last
“ raid ” on the betting and gambling shops of
Sydney, and the next one should be about due.
About twice a year, or so, an incursion is made
with much pomp and warlike circumstance on
one or two dingy “hells,” and then, when a
conviction has been obtained, and a small fine
inflicted, and the verdict has been duly upset
on appeal owing to some murky and fathomless
technicality, and defendant has gone back to
his shop and is carrying on business as usual,
there is a long interval of peace and holy calm
during which nothing is done. Meanwhile,
any person outside the police force can find a
hundred—yes, one hundred—conspicuous law-
breakers every day without the slightest diffi-
culty. There are at least fifteen of them
in King-street, alone, whose establishments
are in full blast all day and far into the
night. There is no disguise about these
places ; nobody guards the entrance ; there
is no need for introductions or any other
ceremony ; it is only necessary to shove the
door Open and enter. Inside there is an awful
atmosphere worthy of the Black Hole of
Calcutta, and about 40 people can generally
be found within, lounging, smoking, spitting,
and talking horse. The place is pervaded by
horse. Round the walls are long lists of avail-
able doubles not yet taken, and as each one is
backed to the limit of the firm’s book a man (or
sometimes a precocious boy) comes round with
blue pencil and scores it out in the business-like
fashion of a person who follows a perfectly
legitimate calling. Often there is a detective
in the room casting an intelligent eye over the
lists on the walls, and generally there is a
policeman outside, looking with a glazed expres-
sion at the people who go in and out talking
loudly about horse. Anyone who desires to
find a tote, or to do an unlawful gamble at poker
or nap, can also be accommodated in the same
locality, where almost every kind of game is in
full blast at almost all hours. The tobacconist
who runs the poker-shop sells a supply of
“ chips ” over the counter to any reasonably
clean person who wants to buy, and makes no
more pretence at secresy than if he were a bank
or an advertising philanthropist. Under these
and many similar circumstances, The Bulle-
tin’s respect for the much-trumpeted, semi-
annual police “ raid ” has gone down below
zero. The average Hebrew who runs the
gambling establishment is so small and harm-
less that there is no visible cause why any
reasonably muscular policeman should not arrest
two of him with each hand at any hour, and
then, having run in his prey, go back for four
more. The “raid” seems only a large, ornamental
way of scaring off the law-breaker and giving
him warning in advance of what is about to
happen, and in proportion to the circumstances
of the case it looks as ridiculously dispropor-
tioned as calling out an army-corps to sur-
round a worm and take the insect by surprise.
The only possible explanation of the apathy
of the police is that they, or some of
them, are in partnership with the oily
person who runs the business. That per-
son’s unlawful trade is as conspicuous as the
General Post Office, and his address can be
generally found in the advertising columns
of The Bulletin, or any “ great ” and
moral daily paper. When Premier Dibbs
assumes, as he does, that the force is honest and
ungreased, and does its duty to the best of its
ability, and that when it lets the betting-shark
go it does it through pure ignorance, he asks
too much from human credulity. Meanwhile,
it is a matter for pleasant reflection that men are
constantly being hanged or sent to long terms of
penal servitude on the evidence of the same
venal police force which sells its soul to the
“tote’’-fiend and acts as jackal to the garish
bookmaker.
The Woman Examined.
The success of Miss Johnson at Cambridge,
recalling that of Miss Fawcett, who also
ranked higher than all the male examinees, is
another illustration of the psychological differ-
ences of sex. Examination is, perhaps, the
best available test of intellectual quality, but
examiners know how often it results in the sur-
vival of the unfittest for the intellectual battle
of after-life. It is a matter of general experi-
ence that, where training has been similar, and
in a certain class of subjects, girls succeed
better than boys, and women than men. In
memory-work, in interpretation, females are,
as a rule, superior to males ; in anything which
involves originality and initiative the males
nearly always lead. As examinations are
chiefly based on memory, and success
depends largely upon the assimilation of
a large number of recognised facts, women
should succeed much oftener than they do, and
when their education is carried to the same
pitch as that of men it is probable that they
will far surpass their sex-rivals. But this
receptivity is certainly not a sign of intellectual
superiority; involving, as it generally does,
less of the originality, the creative power which
is the basis of intellectual progress. A woman
rarely generalises ; she associates incongruous
ideas with less facility than a man. Hence her
comparative lack of humour ; she is incapable
of making an induction from distantly-related
experiences. Hence the very slight additions
to knowledge which we owe directly to women.
They remain intellectual echoes of men, pre-
serving with plastic readiness any impressions
which men have made upon them. They are
phonographs able to reproduce what has been
spoken, but with no power of original speech.
It would be safe to wager that among the text-
books to which Miss Johnson owed her victory
not one by a woman found any place. Since
the beginning of this century many cultured
and talented women have lived with full oppor-
tunity for philosophical investigation, yet is
there one who has given a new impulse to philo-
sophical thought ? George Eliot was domi-
nated by Lewes, himself dominated by Comte ;
Constance Naden’s high promise was cut short
by the early failure of an overstrained organi-
sation ; since the death of Bradlaugh, Annie
Besant’s intellect has become the slave of her
emotional nature, and she has abandoned the
facts of science for the dreams of theosophy.
Yet the value of women’s talent must not be
underrated. As teachers, interpreters, they
have full scope for most valuable work. And
though “it is inconceivable that a woman
should have devised the Copernican system,” it
is necessary not to forget that we owe a good
half of Copernicus to his mother.
Dear Bulletin, —Some Kanaka facts. The
nigger death-rate at Bundaberg for the five
months ended May 31 was no less than between
80 and 90 per 1000 : causes principally pul-
monary, the “ boys ” who leave the islands for
the first time being the most susceptible.
MTlwraith now proposes to bring New Guinea
natives to the province for short terms—
just the few months of crushing, returning
them at the end of the season. That will mean
hereafter a death-rate of nearer 200 than 100,
more especially as the “ boys” will change their
steamy climate for the westerly winds and
frosts of the Queensland winter. It may be
tolerably certain that, so long as he remains in
New Guinea, Gov. M ‘Gregor will bitterly
oppose the deportation of natives from the
island, but should MTlwraith carry out his
intention the sugar-country of Queensland will
in a short time be converted into huge cemeteries
for our dear black brother. Now, here’s
another fact. Kanakas are returned to the
islands suffering from horrible diseases—tuber-
culosis and syphilis principally. Do you think
we are doing our duty to the heathen in send-
ing so many consignments of such diseases to
the unfortunates who have remained at their
island homes ? If we must have black slavery,
let us compel the great sugar industry to main-
tain a hospital for incurables, where those whom
the System has worn out shall be isolated and
so treated as to minimise their suffering.—
Wurry M.
The rift in the lute of New South Wales Pres-
byterian Assembly has been filled up amid
general congratulations and withdrawals.
Moderator Maclnnes went through the ordeal
of a four hours’ examination by Censor Dill
M ACKY.and came out whitewashed, triumphant.
Maclnnes explains that he didn’t refer to the
“original texts” when he fulminated against
the verbal inspiration of the Bible; and Dill
Macky agrees that the English version isn’t
verbally inspired. This only makes the diffi-
culty worse, since there are no “original texts.”
The oldest Hebrew manuscript is some 900
years old, and Moses is said to have written
the Pentateuch about 3300 years ago, so that
there is a gap of 2400 years during
which the “original text” was meandering
about Heaven only knows where or how.
Of course, the average Presbyterian doesn’t
bather his head over these things. He simply
loves his Bible ; but lie doesn’t read it or think
about it ; and he doesn’t like his ignorant faith
to be tested by awkward questions. This was
what Rev. P. F. M'Kenzie meant by saying
that there was not a single new explosive in the
Moderator’s bombshell, but it naturally irri-
tated people who knew very little about theo-
logical matters. The clergy know a great deal
more about the Bible than they are willing to
tell their flocks. The first sign of scepticism is
a decrease in collections ; but the hand of true
faith is always in its pocket. Therefore the
clergy keep their palms open and their mouths
shut.
An eye kept on Mildura sees in all their glory
the direct effects of prohibition—law-breaking,
perjury, crime, gaol, more crime, and the evils
of drink in their original proportions, intensi-
fied by bad liquor sold at a high price. Nine
sly grog-sellers have just been convicted and
fined large amounts, with the alternative of
gaol. What follows? Some will pay the fine,
and re-engage in the trade, decreasing still
further liquor quality in order that increased
profit may form an insurance fund against the
next fine. Some will go to gaol, will rank as
criminals, mix with criminals, and leave gaol
with a strong impetus to commit real crimes
against the community. Will the sale of
liquor be lessened ? Not a whit. Those who
drank will continue to drink until the end of
Time, or until restraint from within is substi-
tuted for restraint from without. The evils of
drink are serious; but it is questionable
whether, proportionately, they are anything
like as great as those of prohibition.
The latest libel trouble in connection with
Justice, the organ of the Sydney “Active
Service Brigade,” has ended in the five editors
getting into gaol for various terms. Justice,
which suspended publication after a brief and
stormy career, had a vast superfluity of editors.
The curse which hangs heaviest upon the
New South Wales Labour-party—or rather on
the weird assortment of orators who hold forth
in the Domain and insist on claiming relation-
ship with the Labour-party, thereby bringing
it into undeserved disgrace—is that it contains
too many ungrammatical amateur journalists,
all filled with great masses of green, undi-
gested political economy. All these journa-
lists have a profound faith in their own
literary capacity, therefore when they start
a new paper, which happens every week or
two, editors swarm upon it like flies on a
carcase. Their style of journalism generally
consists in picking out some objectionable
politician and stating off-hand that he has three
wives living, or something to that effect, and
then the usual trouble ensues. In the case of
Justice and its five editors, a gross and unclean
attempt was made to get level with Minister
Slattery in the usual primitive fashion, and
when the inevitable law-proceedings followed,
several of the editors proceeded to get into the
witness-box and lay the blame on each other to
the best of their ability. Even at that late hour
the advantages of saying as little as possible had
not dawned on this large quantity of editors,
and the result was a dismal expose of the hap-
hazard methods on which the defunct paper
was conducted, and an undignified washing of
dirty linen in public. Ultimately three of
the editors were sentenced to nine months,
one to six months, and the other to one
month’s imprisonment in separate gaols.
A few days ago Sultan Muley Hassan, of
Morocco, was gathered to his fathers, and amid
the contusion and rumours of annexation which
followed the Sydney Telegraph rose once more
to demand that Britain should annex the
crumbling empire that lies under the shadow of
Atlas. The reason it assigned was that
‘ ‘ Morocco is recognised as the natural granary
of Britain.” That good old “ granary !” The
real natural granaries of Britain, if the Tele-
graph could only see it, are England, Scotland,
Ireland, and Wales. These used to be its
sources of supply in years past, before Free-
trade became the prevalent local superstition.
Now their arable lands are mostly deserted;
some of them are turned into pasture, some into
deer-forests; immense areas are to let for next to
nothing, and can find no tenants; the farmers are
mostly bankrupt; the agricultural population,
which used to fill the ranks of the British
armies and win the British victories, has
emigrated, or drifted into the overgrown,
bloated metropolis, and Britain is perpetually
looking for a new “granary” where some cheap
nigger will grow her food supply for her. The
simple idea of being her own granary never
occurs to her. Also, the Telegraph finds
another reason for annexation in the fact that
Tangier, on the Moorish coast, is “ the first
British outport on the ocean highway to India.”
A paper which imagines Tangier to be a British
port is capable of any enormity.
That persistent correspondent, “ Wingen ”
Abbott, whose babble goes on for ever, writes
again to the Herald to point out the evils of
State railways, and to exalt the cause of private
enterprise. The following is his principal blast
of execration: —
Our railways have never yet paid working expenses
and interest. The freight charges are just about what it
would cost to carry our goods on waggons with good
roads, and are four times as high as on the private rail-
ways of America, while the wages of railway employees
in America are the same as ours, and the goods carried
per unit of population and per mile of railway more than
three times greater than ours. The keynote of the whole
discussion has been that we do not get the advantage
for this State monopoly that we have the right to expect,
and that the general experience of State management in
other things is here repeated. In spite of apparent
advantages, it takes more and gives less than private
enterprise, and so works in the direction of general
insolvency.
Just here The Bulletin wishes to point out to
Mr. Abbott —not that it will make much differ-
ence to that man of reckless assertions —that
the railways of New South Wales, South Aus-
tralia, and Victoria have, in various years,
managed to pay working expenses and interest;
that the freight-rates in Australia are con-
siderably less than twice the U.S. rates
instead of being four times as much ;
and that the Australian passenger rates, which
“Wingen” Abbott always carefully leaves
out, are considerably below the U.S. average.
Further, it may considerably stagger the awful
Abbott to know that the working expenses for
every mile run on the Australian State rail-
ways, which is the only true method of com-
parison, are less than on the U.S. private lines.
It isMr. Abbott’s worstpeculiarity that henever,
by any possible chance, gets even one of his
figures correct, and in the present instance he is
just as wrong as usual. Even the oft-repeated
fact that the U.S. lines have only been enabled
to show even such miserable results as they
have achieved through enormous State subsi-
dies has never yet reached Mr. Abbott’s wooden
intelligence.

“ Titus Salt ” writes as follows :
Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent “Tom Collins ”
takes exception to the statement of a previous contributor
that the average “moral tone " crowd can’t fight so well
as the people who haven’t a moral tone, and declares that
profoundly moral people are the hist warlike material
on earth. As a proof of this he instances the Vaudois,
“ who hold their three valleys in the Cottian Alps to this
day; ’ Cromwell's Ironsides; the Pilgrim Fathers of
New England; the Huguenots, and the Spartans. “ For
400 years,” he says, “ no Spartan woman ever saw the
smoke of an enemy’s camp-fire, but Sparta deteriorated
morally and went down before the sternly moral republic
of Rome.” Which latter statement, by the way, is pure
ignorance, for Sparta went down in the prime of its
morality, dirt and brutalism, before the hollow, garish,
immoral kingdom of Macedonia, and was a wreck
long ere the first moral Roman came into these
parts. Moreover, the histoiieal illustrations of Brother
Collins prove very little, for there are lots of equally
good illustrations on the other side. Cromwell’s
Ironsides were moral and were brilliantly successful in
battle, even against the still more rigidly moral Scots
under Leslie. The Household troops of Louis XIV. were
immoral and gaudy and sinful, and their record is quite
as good as that of the Ironsides. Also the Janizaries,
whose morals were never especially brilliant, eclipsed
them both. The Pilgrim Fathers were moral and suc-
cessful ; the Spaniards under Cortez were largely re-
cruited from the scum of the earth, aud they were also
successful. The Huguenots went all to wreck under a
succession of moral leaders, and their triumphs were
mainly owing to Henry of Navarre, a man who had almost
every good quality except morality. As for the fact that
Sparta never saw a foreign enemy at its walls for 400 years,
the same can be said of Constantinople, Yeddo, Pekin,
Nineveh, London, of almost all the dismally immoral cities
of the Persian empire, and of thousands of other towns,
mostly places of bad character. There is absolutely no-
thing in the circumstance to brag about; it is so utterly
and miserably commonplace that even if Sodom had been
able to say the same there would be no cause for surprise
in the circumstance. N.B.—The most moral country
in Europe, in the ordinary conventional meaning of
“morality,” is Greece, which is a grovelling, bankrupt,
burst-up place ; and next to it comes Ireland which has
been a conquered province for seven centuries past. Also
Ireland, judging by the criminal records, has about the
best all-round moral tone in Europe. France, Italy, Ger-
many, and Russia are among the worst samples. If “Tom
Collins ” can build a coherent theory on these facts they
are at his service.
Parson Isitt : “ I would rather scavenge the
streets at ss. a day and know at the end of my
days that I had done some good in the world,
than be the wealthiest brewer or publican that
ever lived.” (Cheers.) And this kind of beer-
froth is cheerfully accepted as logic. Yet after
12 months scavenging in all sorts of weathers,
at ss. a day, and with no prospect before him
save that of scavenging for the rest of his miser-
able, smellful life, the chances are that Pastor
Isitt would cheerfully change places with a
rich brewer, or Polynesian slaver, or anybody
who had money, no matter how it was acquired.
And if he did he would be no worse than mil-
lions of others. There is no curse on this eai th
which is quite so accursed as the curse of poverty,
and no comfortable parson can tell for cer-
tain how mean he might or might not be when
scavenging at ss. a day, until he is put to
the test. Moreover, even the moral scavenger
doesn’t die reflecting that he has done some
good in his day and generation. He has never
had time to think of the good he has done ; his
whole life has been bounded by a long-handled
shovel and the tail-view of a mud-cart; and he
dies wondering how his wife will get on with-
out the ss. a day, and whether he will meet the
old, familiar stink in the hereafter. The Bul-
letin hereby urges the comfortable-looking
Pastor Isitt to give up all his worldly goods
and go scavenging in real earnest, and if, at the
end of a year, he isn’t willing and anxious to be
a circus clown, or a brewer, or even a China-
man—if only there is a decent salary attached-
then he is a human anomaly.
New South Wales Minister of Justice Slattery
prosecuted M'Niven, the compositor in Justice
office, for being concerned in libelling him.
Having got M‘Niven sentenced to a month’s
hard in Darlinghurst, the Honorable Tom goes
to the Ministry of Justice, where M‘N. appears
before him (morally) and is discharged. At
Darlinghurst Court prosecutor Slattery was
witness, and had to go under the portico “ till
called on to give his evidence.” As the Minister
of Justice, Mr. Slattery sits as a kind of
criminal revision court, disallows the verdict of
the jury, sets aside the sentence of Judge
Innes, and lets compositor Mac. cut his stick
from quod. At the same time, Tom Slattery
practically affirms the sentences on the other
four prisoners by making no “ recommendation
to his Excellency ”in their cases. . Old Roman
maxim : “ No man is a competent judge in his
own cause.”

Dear Bulletin, —It is a common delusion that
when a mortgage is effected the property
assigned as security for the advance is alone
responsible for payment of principal and in-
terest. This ought to be so, but it cer-
tainly is not. Here is a case which happened
recently in Brisbane: Six years ago A mort-
gaged some land with improvements, houses,
&c., to B (a mortgage co.) for an advance of
£lOOO repayable in three years. Shortly after-
wards C wanted to purchase the land from A,
and A sold him the equity of redemption of the
mortgage, and B, the mortgagee, consented. A
imagined he was perfectly free and clear now,
and that C stood in his place and was
the only person liable to B, the mortgagee. All
went well for nearly six years ; C paid the
interest and received the rents and profits of
the land. But at last he made default in the
payment of the last quarter’s interest. Times
are different from what they were six years ago,
and C is hard hit by the collapse of the boom
and is virtually an insolvent. Like a clap of
thunder in a clear sky comes the peremptory
demand of B, the mortgagee, to A, the
original mortgagor, for payment in full of the
principal, £lOOO, with interest and other inci-
dental charges. A cannot pay, is sued, declared
insolvent and ruined. For six years A has
considered himself safe and made his family
arrangements accordingly, whilst C has
received all the rents from the property, but
being a “ busted ” boomer he is now not worth
powder and shot. This is the result of the
personal covenant in the mortgage, for in every
mortgage the mortgagor “ promises to pay,”

My Dear Moorabinda—
The very mild boom of the Belle Cole concertists
fizzled out in Sydney the other evening, and left
but little trace behind. Belle Cole (she was
Madame Boema’s under-study once in New York,
and they met again at Melbourne Austral Salon,
when Madame Boema “obliged the company,”
but Belle stood on her rights as a vocalist in har-
ness, and refused to air her stock-in-trade for a
little hollow cup of tea. And that reminds me that
Mrs. Brough has never been known to “ oblige” at
any muffin-worry whatsoever, and not for the
want of badly-mannered hostesses begging that
favourite actress to trot herself out either).
But what I really wanted to say when I
started this vast parenthesis was that Belle
Cole must count herself as being the least-
bouqueted foreign artist who has ever headed a
vocal invasion of Australia; nor did any of her
co. lead to the wreckage of anybody’s back garden.
It was so unlike the popular Patey crowd, in
which even Mr. Patey scored a fluttering nosegay
from the reserved seats one evening, or the
Sterling visitation, when Antoinette’s stentorian
shouts were often inappropriately encouraged with
faint lilies.
Flowers were moderately many when the B. and
B. crowd bade Sydney au revoir at the Lyceum
Theatre on Friday, in “ The Amazons ” —thereby
making that bifurcated farce the head and tail of
the season. Mrs. Brough and Grace Noble were
specially pelted, and even Cecil Ward got a spray
from the gods. As is usual on a last night, the
mumming was a little raw (I always detect a
don’t-care-a-rap-ness in the acting on such occa-
sions), and if Brough (as the parson) had broken
out into a comic song, it wouldn’t have seemed
amiss. As it was, he only broke out into a speech
after the final drop had been raised three times,
and as Brough’s speech-making voice has a vibrato
sound in it, like unto a rasp drawn across a grid-
iron, I rather preferred Bouoicault’s curtain-lec-
ture, though all theatrical adieux are necessarily
interesting when you come to think of them. To
see an intensely-flattered audience listening open-
mouthed to a manager standing on end and
asserting, with an air of intense conviction, that
lie will have the liveliest recollections of a city
where his show was S.R.O. five nights in the
week, and that the company will make a point of
coming back that way, is one of the most con-
vincing object-lessons in human gullibility that I
know of.
There was a whopping house for the finish, but
the occasion was spoilt in front, from a theatrical
point of view, by the presence in the circle of a
lady in “ reform ” —or deform—costume, who
made the regular spectacle a blank for every man
within sight of her, and almost every woman—
only that women naturally don’t take such a lively
interest in seeing a girl in pantaloons as men do.
The dress-circle Johnnies gazed boldly as if sizing
her up, clothes and all—the women squinted side-
ways with a suspicion of vague indignation under-
neath a sniff of outraged propriety at the amount
of male attention she was absorbing. Even Mrs.
Brough’s velveteen smalls were forgotten, and
every he-neck was craned to see the lady who had
practically adopted what every woman-suffragist
grabs at in theory, at any rate.
Mademoiselle describes herself as a rich
Frenchwoman on the globe-trot, who has adopted
bifurcations as being more suitable for travelling.
And certainly her get-up was a rather unnerving
thing to meet at a city corner unexpectedly. The
suit was made of grey fine serge, and consisted
of a frock-coat, neatly fitted into the waist (the
most masculine woman clings to the hour-glass
outline like grim death), the skirts falling over
very full trousers ending in grey spats neatly
buttoned. Collar and tie, gloves, small Amazon
hat and light cane completed a get-up intended to
be natty—the weakest points being a small brooch
and earrings, which were most incongruous
addenda to so merciless a fit-out.
Considering what orthodox dressers the women
of Sydney are I really must congratulate my
fellow-citizens on the way they bore up in the
street under the spectacle of Mdlle. Gdnot with
her mannish swagger, her Turkish trousers, and
her little stick. I knew that everybody’s un-
accustomed eyes would be glued on “ them,” but
only a few made a parade of their curiosity. Most
people seemed to meet the lady with apparent
equanimity, and if they held on by lamp-posts
and shop lintels after they had got past, and
doubled up at the rearward prospect, it was quite
their own affair and hurt nobody’s feelings. One
well-known Sydney man hit on the polite ex-
pedient of speeding on ahead and coming back
facing the Spectacle ; but considering it was the
first get-up of the kind ever seen on the Sydney
streets I think people behaved beautifully—full-
faced, at any rate. Latter-day Man is so
apprehensive that some of the myriad feminine
fads of the century will roost beside his own fire-
side, that he views a divided woman with more
nervous horror than light and airy ridicule, and if
anybody laughs £openly fyou may bet he’s a
bachelor.
Mdlle. Genet’s suit may be the very thing to
climb trees in, but for a shapely, well-set woman
like her there isn’t the shadow of a doubt that a
smart gown would do her more justice and make
her more attractive in the eyes of eligible manhood
than her present mixed-up turn-out. There is no
ignoring the fact that woman ought to be a thing
of beauty and a joy for ever, for as long as she can
hold her own; and she never makes a bigger mis-
take than when she flatters unsesthetio man by
imitating his ugly, baggy garments, and then ex-
pects him to fall down and worship a Thing that
looks like a travesty of himself seen in a night-
mare through an opera glass with a squint in it.
“Advanced” women never look pretty—they are
so seldom thoroughly got up. They adopt the—
er—continuations, and wear ’em with a bonnet
with a pink rose in it. Don’t you remember the
widely-circulated photo, of the Maoriland bride in
her knickers and ridiculous veil and wreath—as
incongruous an effect as a sucking-pig I saw on a
butcher’s slab the other day with its mouth full of
violets. By the way, they ought to keep on photo-
graphing that M.L. bride to show how the knioker
suit stands the storm and stress of matrimony.
To-night (Thursday, 21st) the ball to encourage
a freshet in the funds of the Sydney University
Sports Union comes off, at Sydney Town Hall, in
the presence of many intellectual giants, and
with a strong committee, secretary’d by D. S.
Edwards, 8.A., and Mr. Rowland. Next Tues-
day (26th) is the date of the popular Tempe ball —
always a well-manned function for some occult
reason or other. Other hops may be lined with
wall-flowery belledom, but partners are always
sure and certain at the Tempe ball, which is to
happen, as usual, at Sydney Town Hall, in the
presence of vice-regality and a long patron list.
Apropos of hops, I hear that the committee of a
recent charity ball (it happened in Titipu)
is still violently astonished at the behaviour of
his Excellency, to whom half-a-dozen tickets were
posted and a cheque or a return of the cards natur-
ally expected. But neither cards nor coins have
ever turned up, and if that committee has occasion
to send any more tickets in the same direction it
ought to attach them to a fishing-line and jerk ’em
back if things look suspicious at the expiration of
ten days or so.
If the Bland-Holt Dramatic Cos. had returned
to play the hottest dramatic chestnut that ever
adorned a barn, a full house and an encouraging
reception, for Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt, Miss
Watson, Sass and Baker especially, would have
happened just as they did on Saturday, when the
new and naughty spectacular drama, “A Life of
Pleasure,” opened the dramatic season at Sydney
Lyceum with 200 people on the stage, and that
number multiplied by several in front looking on.
There are miles of nice millinery in “A Life,”
&c., but against such a bewildering background of
horses and soldiers and houseboats and gilded
halls, no mere gown could hope to stand out. I
thought the most quietly charming scene was the
houseboat, with lanterns and banjo music and the
ever-popular Bland Holt in a blue-blazer bossing
the hurricane-deck.
Pretty Mrs. Bland Holt, as a music-hall singer,
wore a festive red gown picked out with white,
which was somewhat reminiscent of a bit of
steaky mutton ; but the colour suited Mrs. Holt’s
complexion much better than the fetching Miss
Watson was suited by her Home Rule gown and
rakish hat with tufts of plumage. If ever a
damsel trying to pass herself off as a victim got
unconvincing hats to repent in, that damsel is
Miss Watson, whose taste for giddy-looking stage
millinery has made many a gallery doubt her
innocence. But I thought the colour very suitable
for a deceived and trusting maiden —a bright gas-
green. Mrs. Holt’s handsomest rigging was an
amber satin ball-gown trimmed with rich jet
fringe, and worn with the fashionable gad-fly
cloak of black vel vet, yellow satin and passemen-
terie en suite —a combination that became her to
thelfinger-nails. Miss Watson’s poppy-red turn-
out in the same act was also a -becoming effort,
and I liked her yellow China silk g-.mi over a
mauve brocade petticoat as well as a -y dress in
Miss W.’s sartorial repertoire.
The social rtS-union in aid of the Ran Iwiok R.G.
church fund eventuated at Paddington Town Hall
last Thursday, and was in every way a-ur-cess—
floor, feeding, fiddling, and, in some u tances,
frocking presenting no weak points. Tha ball has
seldom been so remorselessly trimmed f:om stage
to staircase, and the plenteous supp r was almost
too well done. Of course, all th • dresses didn’t
and charmer, in black peppered with silver
flowers, reminded me of an undertaker’s sign-
board, and another lady sat with her skirt at half-
mast because she had a lace petticoat on—but there
were compensations. Mrs. Humphrey Oxenham,
for instance (an active promotress of the ball) wore
a really charming gown of pale strawberry pink
brocade almost covered with real lace, and a
glittering display of diamonds. Miss Wakeford
sported white brocade, Mrs. E. Brewer had black
brocade with pink velvet sleeves and lashings of
black jet. The attendance was a somewhat sporty
one, as a largely Randwick crowd could hardly
fail to be, and some parts of the ball-room sug-
gested that “Tatt’s” must have been a deserted
wigwam for that evening at least. They are
going to make an annual of the Randwick dance.
Youra affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, 19th June.
The “ Passing of Ryley ” will be a protracted
agony, after all. Friday night’s audience, despite
the jolly “Vicar of Bray,” wallowed in anticipa-
tory woe the whole evening, which was rudely
dispelled by the announcement of a farewell
matinee. It was doubly aggravating as the hero
of the occasion, fat and florid in Tommy Merton’s
hunting “pink,” had hung his lip throughout,
singing and acting without energy; so that not
only as a farewell was the performance disappoint-
ing. A judicious choice of cuts and colours has
before now influenced the destinies of a nation.
Ryley (“Charliedarling” though he be) would soon
lose his charm if he often wore red. It completely
vulgarises him, and his comparative failure as
Paul Jones may be ascribed to the treacle-coloured
knickerbooker suit of its earlier scenes. Towards
the end of that opera he was himself again,
strutting the stage in heliotrope brocade and
primrose satin, but first impressions count, and
malcontents, not realising the true cause of
offence, wrote to the press, suggesting a “shapely,
handsome lady ” as a more attractive exponent of
Planquette’s pirate.
Even without a systematic course of “ turkey-
red ” the departing baritone is out of favour with
male theatre-goers, who accuse him of “swagger-
ing,” as if the stage were his own suburban villa,
and rolling his eyes as if every woman in the
house were hanging on his glances.
However, on Friday night his “ send-off ” (as it
was fondly supposed to be) was cordial, though
applause died abruptly when the gay deceiver,
with quivering lips and lowered eye-lids, delicately
advertised his matinee, “reserving all parting
words for that occasion,” except the remark that
he was '‘completely unnerved —in fact, quite
touched.”
Le roi est mort, viveleroi! was quoted at the
Princess on Saturday night, when Brownlow,
Ryley’s successor, made his first appearance as
King Henry of Navarre in “ Ma Mie Rosette.”
At the sound of horns and the exclamation, “ lb
is—it is the King,” every eye nearly started out of
the owner’s head with eagerness to gaze upon the
newcomer. When he appeared he was received
with tremendous applause, which completely un-
nerved him, though without any pretence in this
case. Standing at the back, he looked as abject as
a schoolgirl I once saw as Widow Melnotte in a
pretentious amateur company.
Brownlow’s first excitement over, he was much
admired, especially as he, all along, retained suf-
ficient presence of mind to make good use of his
eyes, “ forget-me-not blue ” (as I have heard them
described. His demeanour, so far, contrasts
strikingly with that of his predecessor. His love
method is of the conciliatory kind, Ryley affecting
the swashbuckler variety.
The latter, in the midnight scene, would have
seized Nellie Stewart by the wrist and jerked her
into a masterful embrace by way of bending her
rustic fidelity to his will. Brownlow trusted
largely to “ pleading ” interspersed by hovering
caresses, as if anxious to take no liberties, and
finally stole his arms around her neck from the
rear. At that time of night, naturally, be had
dispensed with his erratic plumed hat and looked
remarkably fetching in close-fitting black, with no
ornament but the royal medallion on its broad
blue ribbon.
Nellie Stewart, as Rosette, cheered one like a
fire on a cold night, having more life, energy, and
passion than all her quondam substitutes put to-
gether. More temper, too, perhaps! ’Tis said
she jibbed at all the costumes sent out for Rosette
(except the Court dress), preferring to design her
own. Her first peasant get-up is quite unique,
being a scant garment of pink flannel (?), the skirt
not down to her knees but with an inch width of
lace frills showing below. The low neck and
absence of sleeves also allow the lace edgings of
undergarments to be seen, and the impression con-
veyed is that the simple village maiden, lost in
admiration of her new flannel petticoat, forgot to
put on her frock. However, she succeeds in look-
ing very pretty with amass of golden hair framing
her face like a halo. Later on, she wears an
innocent poke bonnet with pink bows, and finally
a rich, white ball-gown glistening with jewels.
Florence Young, in the same scene, is gorgeous in
a gold-flowered brocade.
Lover Tapley rather distinguished himself*
though, like Brownlow, he had always to settle
his hat before and after a kiss. It reminded one
of the sailor-man who, when called upon to salute
his new-made mother-in-law, turned up his sleeves
and spat on his hands prior to commencement.
Shareholders in the Bananaland Golden Mount
were interested in the alleged big matrimonial
find of its earliest heiress, whom memory recalled
as the juvenile pedestal of an imposing sun-bonnet.
Less fortunate relatives rehearsed [sotto voce) :
“My cousin, the Duchess.” One of them, locally
renowned for her impassioned couplets and, ’tis
said, her unique collection of dried blackfellows’
fingers, began to burn the midnight oil over a
Nuptial Ode.
The contradictory cable damped, without extin*
guishing, the excitement. After all, it’s only a
postponement, as what’s more inevitable than the
snapping-up of a father-in-law worth <£looo or so
per day ?
When Madame Lucy Chambers died, eight
would-be pupils were waiting“anxiously for
vacancies on her list.
Brither Scots rallied up well to bid good-bye to
James Wood, for that warbling compatriot, like
every other Melb. vocalist under 50, is en route for
European training. The hero of the evening carries
a general resemblance to His Ex., as everybody
knows, and Mr. Wood, being a staunch admirer of
the Nobeelity, used to delight in clean shaves and
swallowtails, with a view to being mistaken for his
chieftain in a dim light.
At the farewell function he fell away from his
ideal, appearing with a limp moustache and horrid
red tie, which made one almost glad to see the last
of him. Nevertheless, the £lOO-oheque was pre-
sented, though in so “dour” a manner that the
recipient became unnerved, and in returning
thanks strayed away into a tangled wilderness of
nonsense. At his first pause we mercifully
arrested the discourse with “ Auld Lang Syne,”
“ wailing a portion with judicious care,” as sug-
gested by Burns in “Cottar’s Saturday Night.”
By-the-bye, “the Peasant bards of Scotland”
presents inspired Bobbie in a new light as a
maligned saint, who, so far as I could make out,
was a martyr to his illegitimate father-m-law.
The Lyric Club concert fell flat musically, and
otherwise. The decorations failed to redeem the
situation, consisting, as they did, of tiny, accor-
deon-pleated weepers of terra-cotta paper ranged
round the walls at’eiaot distances apart and mid-
way between roof and floor. A feature was the
manning of the gangways by gilded youth, who
pouted their shirt-fronts and twirled their mous-
taches, by way of showing people to their seats.
Concert dressing, I notice, becomes more and
more a “ go-as-you-please,” and at the Lyric
gathering reefer jackets and tweed toques accen-
tuated jewelled hair-daggers and uncompromising
shoulder-blades. A Toorak dame in greeny-blue
opera-wrap smiled upon her hopefuls in chorus
and orchestra respectively, the younger in full
war-paint, while son and heir hung his head in a
black tie and bob-tailed jacket, A pretty harpist
who constantly hurried from the maternal wing
to her seat on the platform, twanged her lyre and
flashed her eyes between its strings at the audi-
ence, until one was reminded of Miriam crossing
the Red Sea.
An uncommon head-dress was achieved by a
dowager. This matured innovator, combing her
tresses smoothly to her crown in accordance with
the fashion before last, departed at this stage from
the flat-plaited mat style and erected aloft a sharp
sugar-loaf cone. The “ Pagliacci coiffure ” would
be a good name for the structure.
Art Gallery girl students have lost some of their
pristine zest, now that their “director” is engaged
to the daughter of a local Pi M. Apart from their
disapproval, however, the gentleman won’t be any
the worse for a wife. Soon after his arrival, he
invited his disciples in a battalion to a private
view of his pictures. They found the function
disappointing. In the absence of any sort of
hostess, they prowled about unoared for, and what
was worse—far worse—unfed and undrinked.
Conspicuous on a side - table were superfine
chocolates, wine, and fruit, but no one
authorised them to partake, and, in any case, the
miracle of the loaves and fishes would have
had to be repeated to make the collation go
round. So the visitors surveyed the exhibits
through a mist of longing, and with that sensa-
tion of betrayed trust which a blow from an
unexpected quarter always produces.
Mias Melian Stawell, delivering her Browning
lecture at Scots Church, was effectively up-
holstered in skirt and broad sleeves of dark-red
serge, contrasting well with bodice and small
toque of black velvet and jet sequins. Human
nature is strangely diversified. This well-dressed
and commanding young woman, “ cultured ” up
to the hilt, was far too nervous to make herself
heard among the back seats. At any blue-ribbon
meeting, one may hear little Miss “4 foot
nothing,” without an “h” in her composition,
pitch her voice in painfully audible falsetto,
and jabber away with the greatest confidence.
The ’Varsity professor, who moved the vote of
thanks, seemed slightly jealous of the feminine
poacher on his preserves. Browning has been
considered his inalienable property up to now.
VAN M.
Premier Dibbs insisted upon hanging the
Bridge-street burglars because it was “the law.”
A few days ago he commuted the death sentence
passed upon a man for ravishing his own daughter,
although it also was “the law.”
Patterson still whines about retrenchment,
and gnaws ceaselessly at the Public-service bone.
Soon he will commence to suck the marrow. The
Government fears to propose an Income or a
Land-tax. What is badly wanted in Victoria is
another people’s Ministry as in the fifties, when
the Appropriation-bill was effectively used as a
vehicle for euchring the Council. But it won’t
come. God doesn’t waste two Higinbothams in a
century on one tinpot community.
Murderer Bertrand was packed off to Eng-
land third-class by the Austral, with .£5O gaol-
allowance and £22 of his own. The only persons
who attended to see him depart were Canon Rich,
the gaol chaplain, and a warder. It has been
stated that Bertrand’s health is hopelessly broken,
but that is not so in the opinion of prison officials.
By the way, Bertrand had been so long un-
accustomed to wear a shirt tl}at he absolutely had
forgotten how to fix up the studs and sleeve-links.
The most dramatic speech made by the
accused before sentence in the Justice criminal
libel prosecution at Sydney last week was
“Tommy” Dodd’s. It was evidently modelled
on the style of Robert Emmett’s speech from the
dock, and concluded with Emmett’s last words,
“ I have done.” The only one of the accused who
behaved in a decent and dignified way throughout
the trial was Mason, the obvious sincerity and
manliness of whose remarks secured for him
much sympathy from all who heard him speak.
Elsewhere in this issue is reproduced a
fine portrait by Freeman, of Sydney, of Mr.
Edward Knox, M.L.0., and Mrs. Knox, whose
golden wedding was celebrated on 4th June by a
gathering of the employes of the Colonial Sugar
Co., with which Mr. Knox has for 50 years been
connected as manager and managing-di rector.
The proceedings were characterised by a friendly
feeling which made it abundantly evident that the
occasion was not one of merely formal tribute.
The chairman, Mr. T. Buckland, emphasised
the fact that the address, signed by 1200
officers and workmen of the Sugar Co.
which was presented to Mr. Knox, and
the gold plate given to Mrs. Knox, repre-
sented spontaneous and heartfelt congratulation.
Mr. Knox, in replying, referred to the good under-
standing which had been continually maintained
between the directors and their subordinates
during the whole period of the Company’s exist-
ence. Such a thing as a “ labour difficulty ” is,
indeed, so far as the Colonial Sugar Co. is con-
cerned, an unknown quantity; and the tradition
of kindly management and cheerful service which
Mr. Knox has now handed down to his son, Mr.
E. W. Knox, is probably without a parallel among
undertakings of similar extent and responsibility.
There is terrible excitement in the Ranga-
tehaurocrikey district of Maoriland about the
phenomenal growth of an old resident named
Gozzlechopper, who has been bursting successive
series of pants in the most alarming manner, until
now his girth is so great that one tailor has to
hold the measure while another runs round him
with the tape, shouting “Fifteen-two, fifteen-
four, and a pair’s eight!” or some such sartorial
gibberish. His limbs have grown in proportion,
and his strength is marvellous, but the side of the
house has had to be taken down to let him in, and
they are talking about widening the streets to give
him room to walk. What is going to happen if he
keeps on growing no one can foresee; but he will
persist in eating Parsons’ Flaked Oatmeal, and
grown fatter and jollier and rosier every day.

Bland Holt began his season at Sydney
Lyceum with “ A Life of Pleasure”—a production
which has more fizzing and banging aiffi violent
concussion and gunpowder-smoke in it than any
melodrama yet seen in Sydney. In fact, for solid,
enduring row this piece stands absolutely alone.
Otherwise it goes very much on the accustomed
lines, inasmuch as the heroine is bitterly deceived
by the strictly vertical captain in the long
moustache, and leaving the noble but clean-
shaven lover in the lurch, she flies to London and
plunges into the vortex of dissipation, and wears
the exceedingly low red dress which is the out-
ward evidence of being lost within. Then the
wicked captain goes back on all his promises, and
marries someone else, and shakes his wife violently
in her dressing-room ; and the deceived girl takes
poison, but recovers and becomes good once more,
and the captain takes poison and goes out to die
seriously on the door-mat. These are the mam
features of the story, which is, however, com-
plicated a good deal by a battle somewhere in
Burinah, with Bland Holt’s eye-glass beaming like
a star through the jungle. The troops on this
occasion are carrying all their baggage on a hand-
barrow, which is urged with great difficulty
through dank morasses and deep moist ravines
and up precipitous mountains, while Cosgrove, as
a foolish-looking colonel, urges it on with spirit-
stirring yells. Meanwhile, B. Holt gets on his
noble steed and goes off for help, and can be after-
wards heard fighting desperately with eleven
dacoits in the wings.
• * •
A lot of valuable talent has been put into
the scenery of “ A Life of Pleasure.” The jungle,
with a river of real water, is good ; and a view of
the Thames in a previous act is superb. Sass,
who has a heavy part, makes an absolutely per-
pendicular villain; in fact, his rigidity partly
spoils an otherwise good character. Misses
Henrietta Watson and Harrie Ireland, and Bland
Holt and his wife are the principal successes of
the piece. Bland’s eye-glass especially is a bright
spot in the dark places of the drama, and when it
looms up in the jungle it looks like a Koh-i-noor
hung upon a wreck. Also, The Bulletin desires
to say a very kind word for Mr. Baker; and 35
other people are held over till some future occasion.

On Friday (June 22) Sydney Royal opens
for one night only, when Mr. Dampier will take a
benefit prior to his departure for England. The
bill on this memorable occasion is “ Robbery
Under Arms,” and as this will be Dampier’s last
appearance in Australia, the assemblage ought to
be the very biggest which the old theatre has wit-
nessed in all its long and troubled career. If it
isn’t then there is no justice on earth or else-
where. Mr. Dampier is known all over Australia
not only as a sterling actor, but as a most unselfish
and honourable gentleman, and he has been a
popular favourite for so many years past that he
has grown to be one of the institutions of the
country; and altogether he is probably more
deserving of a big benefit than any other local
member of the profession. Therefore, some of his
friends have formed themselves into an influential
committee to push forward the arrangements, and
Mr. Rainford has put his capacious shoulder to
■’the wheel as hon. stage manager.
** * *
The “Flying Scud” will fly for the last
itime at Her Majesty’s on Friday, and on Satur-
day its place will be filled by “ After Dark.’’ On
ithis memorable occasion George Rignold, who has
been taking a long rest, will reappear as Old Tom.
This gratifying drink has, if IHE Bulletin re-
members aright, been played by him with much
success in days gone by, and the public will sample
lit again with pleasure.
** * *
Sydney Criterion, after a long period of
silence and desolation, reopens on Saturday, when
Miss Hilda Spong proposes to appear as Rosa-
lind in “As You Like It.” Miss Spong is under-
stood to be supported by a strong company,
particulars of which are not available at time of
writing. The scenery is painted by Spong pere,
which is a sufficient guarantee that it, at all events,
will be everything that can be desired.
* * *
“Ma Mie Rosette,”the new production at
Melb. Princess’s, is a seriously-inclined opera of
the “ La Oigale ” species, strong in Irench senti-
ment, but weak in “ comic relief.” The music must
always have been lighter than the libretto, and
the English versions of both are yet lighter than
the originals. The French score was cut down to
make room for tuneful interpolations by Ivan
Oaryll whilst the plot underwent revision by Mrs.
Grundy. In the present instance, a couple of pas
de deux have been lifted, more or less, from The
Vicar of Bray ” and dropped into the midst of the
show to give it an air of frivolity. If the manage-
ment were to add a joyous ballet one might
predict an enduring success for Ma Mie
Rosette.” As matters stand, it is a handsome
entertainment, appealing to the popular taste for
spiciness, leaving a pleasant impression on the
ear-drum, and affording another forcible argument
against monarchs. The story dates back 300
years, and France has changed its constitution in
the meantime, but the argument holds good, all
the same.

Nellie Stewart, in possession of a bright
stage farm, is about to marry gardener Tapley
when Henri of Navarre proposes to fix her up in
his adjacent chateau and make a real lady of her,
such as he has already made of Florence Young
and others whose names do not appear. Nellie’s
virtuous love wavers under this awful temptation,
and the gardener decides to become a victorious
warrior so that he may fulfil his sweetheart’s new
idea of a husband before claiming her hand. King
Henri, being artful, approves of this resolution,
and Tapley prepares to quit, whereupon Nellie
swoons in the farmyard. The next act is purely
mythical. Nellie, lying prone upon some straw,
with her feet to the audience, dreams that Henri
has enticed her to the chateau with base inten-
tions. She has a vision of Tapley returning,
after a hasty conquest of the Spaniards, to
find her nestling against His Majesty’s shoul-
der, She hears the King order Tapley away
to execution, then she swoons within her swoon,
so to speak, and recovers consciousness. She has
bub pictured all this gilded misconduct in her
faint, even as Uncle Dick, in H. J. Byron’s
comedy, dreamed of what would happen to his
darling if she married an M.P. instead of a black-
smith. Arising from the straw, Nellie bids her
faithful gardener remain where he is, and when
the profligate Sovereign comes strolling back to
the farmyard she rejects his royal overtures with
an indignant stare. Nellie prefers to marry
Tapley, and enjoy humble bliss. Whether a
young dreamer of her stamp will stick to the
gardener, after she gets him, is a question for the
audience to consider on its homeward way.
• • *
Miss Nellie Stewart and the new arrival,
Wallace Brownlow, have an almost entire control
of the opera. The prima donna is especially sweet
in her rustic garb; indeed, she hasn’t equalled the
charm of her present appearance since she played
Cinderella in pantomime, nigh ten years ago. We
have Miss Nellie at her best in all respects. Mr.
Brownlow, elaborately and tastefully made-up,
with a fair French beard and a slight accent to
match, is a reminder of Darmong, the beauty man
of Bernhardt’s co. He is certainly the right actor
for this character of a lady-killing king of the
olden time, when such people were probably like
their pictures. He has an insidious turn of the
tongue for attacking a woman’s heart, and his
legs are highly satisfactory. His baritone voice,
however, is divided into two parts, the more effec-
tive half being tenor in quality. A very light
organ compared with Ryley’s (which is heavy even
to dullness), and with a constant tremble in it.
Tapley plays the gardener indifferently. He scolds
when he should be heroic, and his aspect is un-
impressive. Somebody is needed to teach Tapley
the art of displaying his face and clothes to advan-
tage. Miss Young and Howard Vernon have un-
thankful parts, whilst Lauri and Miss Clara
Thompson justify their low-comedy scenes by
dancing humorously as aforementioned.
** * *
At Melbourne Royal the riotous narrative
of Charles Holloway and the steam-hammer, and
the capitalist who knocked a hole in his em-
ploye’s roof has begun to pall somewhat upon the
patrons of legitimate melodrama. “True as
Steel ” has its faults, in spite of the awful murder
in the prologue. Robert Inman is but a small,
commonplace villain, with a ridiculous habit of
talking from his stummick, or his boots, or some
place other than the spot that Nature intended his
tones to proceed from. The young lover who
ought to get his hair cut constitutes a serious
drawback. Miss Maud Williamson’s cold and
hungry death aims at realism, and is, therefore,
out of harmony with the dramatic surroundings.
Also, the dying mother’s child suffers from a
tendency to fold her hands in prayer. But when
every possible objection has been raised against
“ True as Steel ” it can still point to the steam
hammer and defy carping criticism to do its
worst. The present writer admires the workman-
like sensation attaching to the hammer, and con-
siders it a much finer bit of drama than the steam-
roller incident, enacted on the same stage a while
ago. On Saturday the busy Holloway will give
them “My Jack.”
«* » *
Elsewhere there is a considerable collapse
of Melbourne shows. The Bijou wants a tenant
once again. The Melb. Amateur Opera 00. are
about to produce “The Gondoliers’’ there, for
one consecutive Saturday, but otherwise the
pretty little house has no engagements booked.
It was once on the cards that “ Morocco Bound
would tempt fortune at the Bijou ; now it is settled
that the coming novelty will be run by arrange-
ment with “the Firm,’’ starting at Sydney
Lyceum. Fitzgerald Brothers have shaken the
dust and ashes of the Alexandra from their young
Australian feet, and resumed their travels with
the old, reliable tent. The variety companies are
working seven nights a week as usual.
** * *
The Belle Cole combination will make three
more Melb. appearances in oratorio or ballad con-
cert to-night (Thursday) and on Saturday and
Monday next. Friday afternoon is dedicated to
the solemn feast of Ryley, that popular baritone
having consented to accept a matinee benefit (they
call it “ testimonial” nowadays), whereat he will
make a farewell speech, according to promise.
At Porerty Point.
A correspondent: L. L. Lewis’s “Helping Hands’
amateuring, in Melb., was pleasant, even apart from the
grace of Hopeboun. Private sec. Wallington cannot relish
his gold - buttoned coat, turned up with red people
took him for a flunkey. With 50 in the orchestra, 20 of
them ladies, conductor Howard got a good body of
siund, though the “Cavalleria Rusticana” intermezzo
was saw raspy. Inasmuch as Rosa Dunn left the boards
30 years ago, «he must now be a demi-centenarian, but
how every turn recalled her old self 1 Innes-Noad, a
Harry Rickards sort of man, with a strut and straddle,
acted well enough with her in “ Dream Faces.” “Trial
by Jury” was extremely well done, after some creaky-
dolly Lethbridgism.
Anna Ruppert, whose name is familiar as a “ facia
artiste ” or faker-up of ladies’ complexions, is to make
her appearance as the Lady of the Camellias at a London
theatre.
Lucy Chambers, as Maffio Orsini, was incredible. Her
tights were so very tight that one night, in the banquet-
scene, she had to sing the brindisi from a kind obscurity
at the back of the stage. The tights had “ struck 1”
“ Humerous ” Recitations figure on a placard outside
Melb. Town Hall, while the bills, in Fitzroy, of an amateur
performance, announce it for the benefit of an institution
to support women who would otherwise be “ beggars.
It is mentioned that a starving Melb. actress, well-
known on the boards, has had to send her two children to
a benevolent institution.
A group of young Melb. ladies have been doing, in
public, the “Vicar of Bray’s” dance with the ballet
without any Vicar.
Lilian Davies, the lively damsel who played with Billee
Barlow in pantomime at Melb. and Sydney, has lately got
good notices for an emergency performance in “Jaunty
Jane Shore,” at the Strand Theatre. Lilian was spoken
of here as a hard worker, always following the music
with her head, hands and feet.
The daring Dans, Barry and Fitzgerald, announce their
circus as the first seen on the Melb. stage. Now, Burton
was at the Royal 33 years ago.
Bentley’s forthcoming Melb. lecture on “Church and
Stage ” is announced as in reply to Rev. Marshall. _ These
former chums and schoolmates do not appear to hit it so
well. The fact is, Marshall had to tone down in his last
lecture.
A certain Gaiety danseuse has announced her intention
of revisiting Australia soon. Once when Mary Weir kicked
as high and as gracefully as the Gaiety girl, the latter
could with difficulty be restrained from attempting to
inflict corporal punishment on Mary. Then the Gaiety
girl, backed up by an actor, forthwith announced to the
Princess’ management that Miss Weir must not again
appear during the season. In the interests of peace she
did not, but she drew her salary all the same during the
run of the pantomim“, which was a long one. Mary Weir
has just arrived in E igland, a fact which may have some-
thing to do with the other one’s determination to leave it.
Madame Lucy Chambers, the singer, who died
lately in Melb., was the daughter of Hugh John
Chambers, for so many years a well-known Sydney
lawyer. The late James M'Pherson Grant was articled to
Chambers.
Williamson’s Opera Company will shortly part with
Ryley, Nellie Stewart, Tapley, and Vi. Varley. Who are
to replace this quartette ? Btownlow is a handsome substi-
tute tor Ryley except perhaps in the matter of legs and
clasp, but will it mean Florence Young for Nellie Stewart,
and May Pollard for Vi. ?
Gov. Robinson’s opera of “Predatores, or the Brigand s
Bride,” is to be produced in Adelaide during his visit to
Lord Kintore. Probably by amateurs.
The return of Edward Terry and Kate Vaughan to the
London burlesque stage did not evoke much enthusiasm.
To speak plainly (says The Bulletin’s correspondent),
their methods are not those of to-day, and Terry is not so
up to date as Arthur Roberts. Clever as Terry and Kate
are, they will not re-light the “ sacred lamp of
There is certainly an excuse for them, for “ King Kodak ”
is about as mild a burlesque as it would be possible to
find.
Greville left £5OOO. His will was only 13 lines. Ten
years ago, the pros, sized him up at ten thou.
Wallace Brownlow, “ the Firm’s ” new man, was the
original Luiz in the first production of the “Gondoliers. •
Louise Jordan Miln (consort of “ Geo. C. Miln,
tragedian ”) last month brought out a book of travel and
anecdote entitled, “ When We Were Strolling Players in
the East.” Wonder if she tells how once, when the cur-
tain went up suddenly in “ Antony and Cleopatra,” she
was discovered on a throne • • • •
Any pro. will confidentially fill in the blanks. Also, does
she tell how when Miln, as Othello, was trailing her, as
Desdemona, round the stage, a voice from the gallery was
heard saying; “Serve her crimson well right.
Billy, the woman went to bed with her boots on 1 ”
Courtneidge, writing en route to London, reported that
the 8.8. Australia carried one bishop, an archdeacon, and
innumerable minor clerics in the first saloon, and that
the voyage had been full of prayer. The Church seems
to spend plenty of money in trips to Europe, by the way.
Marie Brooks, the danseuse who became the wife of
the junior Curran, M.P., has joined the R.C. Church, and
attributes her conversion to her old friend, Mary Weir,
whom she has quite out-distanced in the matter of piety.
Marie, who was so lissome in the old days, now shows a
decided tendency to embonpoint.
Mary Weir, who went to London for a six months’ trip
to pick up new notions—or motions —in the leg art, avows
that there is nothing in London worth introducing for the
Princess pantomime, in which she will be the chief
danseuse.
Aim6e Moore plays the part of Celia in Sydney Criterion
production of “ As You Like it,” which commences on
Saturday evening with Hilda Spong as Rosalind.
The MacMahons will produce-“ Morocco Bound" at
Melb. Princess’ in eight weeks time.
Mias Staunton says that her proper Christian name i®
Cecilia not Cecily. Some time ago a certain theatnca*
manager wrongly billed her as Cecily Staunton, and she
has adopted the Christian name ever since.
The sad and unaccountable self-destruction of Mr.
Charles Hudspeth, a young Tasmanian solicitor, removes
one from the list of Hobart dramatic amateurs who will
be missed. He was a really clever and versatile comedian
and could, had he been so inclined—as could his brother,
Frank Hudspeth, of the Tas. civil service—have risen
rapidly in the dramatic profession.
Henry Hoyt, of Melbourne, was to produce a comedy-
drama at the Prince of Wales, London, last month, with
Olga Brandon, the naughty, as the heroine.
Minnie Hylton, Letty Lind’s clever sister, has carried
oft what, so far as cash is concerned, may be called a prize
in the matrimonial lottery, she having recently married a
young gentleman named Sims, for long a well-known
habitue of the Gaiety. They say he is immensely wealthy,
but those things (remarks The Bulletin's London corres-
pondent) are always exaggerated. There must be some-
thing radically wrong with young ladies in good society
when they have so much difficulty in getting rich hus-
bands, whilst the “ lydys” of the music-hall and theatri-
cal professions find no difficulty in capturing the most
eligible partis. I think I mentioned some time ago that
a certain relative of Minnie’s would now be wearing a
coronet were it not for the inconvenient existence of a
wife who cannot be got rid of. She has, on dit , arrived
at the stage of sporting the family diamonds, which looks
like biz.
George Bernard Shaw, whose new play has been so
much criticised by the London press, was once cleverly
described as a “monotone in Jaeger.” He wears a Jaeger
shirt with turn-down collar of ditto, a suit of Jaeger cloth,
Jaeger socks, Jaeger shoes, Jaeger hat, and he even uses
a Jaeger pocket-handkerchief. To crown it all, he has
yellow hair and beard, and his face is nearly the same
colour as his hair and clothes. He even goes into the
opera stalls in the same clothes covered by a cloak of the
same hideous, jaundice-suggesting material.
The anniversary of Ben Dizzy’s decease is a great Tory
occasion at the London ’alls. At the loyal Pa\., lor in-
stance, huge bouquets of primroses with yellow streamers
attached are placed in each of the private boxes and the
“ ladies of the staff ” receive sprays of the sacred emblem
from a tear-stained management. The Pav. is extra fond
of Dizzy’s memory because it was the home of M icder-
mott’s jingo song—“ We don’t want to fight.”
When a girl really hugs a man on the stage she is
trying, as a rule, to make the other girl wild. ’Specially
when the other girl happens to be married to him.
Brooklyn lady-amateurs take to burnt-corking for a
charitable entertainment. A good new idea.
Happy Jack Sutton, now of Fitzgerald’s Circus com-
pany fell very sick the other day, and lay at St. Vincent
Hospital, Melb., under the doctor’s sentence of death.
His wife was taken to his bedside, and left to watch him
through the night on condition that she should say
nothing to the patient. About midnight Happy Jack
opened his eyes, gazed languidly at his partner, and said i
“ Addie, if 1 pass in my checks it will be between two
and five.” He wanted her to understand that she had no
occasion to worry herself until dying-time bod set in.
The Wild-Cat Column.
The most important N.S.W. Parliamentary de-
bate of last session—that on the adoption of the report
of the Banking Committee-was scarcely noticed by the
press. The Herald gave almost verbatim reports of the
speeches against the adoption of the report, while sup-
pressing those in its fax our. The maundeiings of John
See (coached by his officers) were given in full, as were
the dismal and depressing regrets of Garvan, the ignorant
chop-logic of Crick, and the senile croakings of Parkes.
Rose’s speech was the best he ever delivered m the
House, and stripped every shred of argument from the
Treasurer, leaving him financially naked, though, of
course, not ashamed. The Herald gave Rose three lines,
and the other speeches for—by Melville, O Sullivan,
Dowall. and Fitzgerald-were cut short, while even the
curious Cruiokshank had his little imbecilities against the
report recorded in solemn Herald “ brevier. The
report recommended a State Bank of Issue and a Oreoit
Fonder, and this was arrived at long before the Vic-
torians had interested themselves in the question. The
finding is backed up by the evidence of the best hanking
talent in N.S.W. ; very often unwilling witnesses. Dibhs
was silent on the subject. M ‘Millan was a member of the
Committee, but never attended, and expressed no opinion
in the debate. The House adopted the report by a large
majority. Nearly all the country members present voted
with the “ ayes.”

The holy James Balfour reared his inflexible
carcase in the Vic. Legislative Council, last week, and
rebuked a member for referring to foreign essays upon
the boom and its results. The commercial credit of
Victoria has a never-failing defender in James Balfour,
whose recent godly aggressiveness denotes that some moi e
Freehold Investment trouble has passed away.

Treasurer Carter admits that the Melbourne
Savings Bank has lent money to non-paying coffee-
palaces and the insolvent Y.M.C.A. It xvas there, says
Carter, that “ teetotal influence and the religious element
came in.” For the moment total abstinence and pietism
are politically “ stiff,” and a ruffled wine-merchant can
safely hold them up to contempt. But self-righteousness
will not have to lie low for long in a church and chapel
ridden community.
* ♦ • *
An argument the Aegus advances for granting
liquor-permits to Melb. “coffee” palaces: “It has been
discovered that the State itself is largely interested in
some of these properties as a mortgagee, and is concerned
in maintaining them as going concerns.” Remembering
the men who were in the coffee palace boom, it is not
surprising to find the State very much “ concerned
indeed.
* * • •
It is said in Melb. that the reserve fund of the
Commissioners of Savings Banks should be written down
heavily. Some say to the extent of £250,000.

Melbourne fraud is Scotched, but not killed.

“The demon of high interest has stifled
numerous industries and checked others,’ says Me V ic-
torian Treasurer—the same Carter who guffawed when
Hancock, three or four years ago, bellowed that the banks
were “ the cause of all the trouble,” and ought to be
abolished. Some of ’em will be abolished, sure enough, a
little later on.
• • • •
James Balfour expects the Vic. Government to
pause and consider before going into a scheme for pro-
viding farmers with cheap money. This, from a member
of the Balfour-EUiott organisation, is an interesting
caution. That crowd wallow r ed in some tolerably cheap
money. , , , ,
It may interest such Victorians as may have
been unable to recover money from debtors who are
under bills of sale to know that nearly all the bills of sale,
dated prior to June 1890, which have been prepared and
registered by certain societies in Melbourne (who make a
specialty of the business') can be upset on the ground that
the notice of Intention to file does noi disclose full
particulars of the actual bill of sale as required by the
statute. There are thousands of these informal bills of
sale in existence, but their illegality has only just been
determined by Justice Hood—and there is no chance in
these days of getting an Act through to validate them.

The cashier of a big Southern firm lately in-
formed the various collectors who called on the firm’s
pay-day for cheques that “ the account is passed and the
cheque signed, and all we are waiting for is some money
to pay in to meet ’em.” The pious head of the firm
showed his appreciation of this candour by immediately
pawning his watch, and with the proceeds giving the
cashier his salary and the “ sack."
♦ * » •
Apropos the forgery of Commercial Bank of
Australia notes, it is worth remarking that all the early
issues of notes by reconstructed Vic. banks are simply
lithographed and badly lithographed at that. This had
to be done owing to there being no engraving-plant suit-
able for the work in Melbourne, and time was (in this
instance particularly) money. Any expert lithographer
or photographer could print a fortune in a few days if he
were fool enough.
• • • •
A gentleman who went out West to start
building on two £6 “ city allotments ’’ which he bought
in Melbourne twelve months ago, was a little surprised
when the vendor informed him that it was “at least
three hours too soon to inspect them.” “Why can’t I
inspect my purchase now ?” insisted the speculator.
“Why? Damn it all, don’t you know it won’t below
tide for three hours yet ?”
* • • •
A private Bill to give power to one William
Riggall “ to take water from the Yarra, and to construct
certain works for making and transmitting electricity, ’
is being pushed quietly in the Vic. Assembly. The Bill,
if passed, will give Mr. Riggall a monstrous monopoly,
and it seems likely to go by when nobody in particular Is
looking. , , , *
They are saying now in Victoria that the chief
jury-squarer has floated himself into a limited company,
like the Duke of Plaza-Toro. Shares are at a heavy
premium. ( ,
Not the most readily saleablethingupSouth these
times is a reversionary interest in property confided to the
custody of any executorial company. It is known that
the benefioiares under a certain will had to threaten pro-
ceedings against a blundering “board” before they
could get anything from the estate. The money then
forthcoming was necessarily debited to the assets of one or
more of the other estates, and so the game will go on for
a little while longer. Who knows what has been done by
some of these wholesale traders in dead men’s property,
and who would give a cent for a £5OOO reversion claim
upon a principal that has practically gone into a general
fund for the payment of immediate creditors?
• • • •
After all the difficulty experienced in finding
out how certain bank balance-sheets were manufactured,
it’s quite refreshing to observe the simplicity with which
the sheet of an insolvent Aus. firm was Inflated. A debt
of £9 16s. lid. owing to the firm is altered t o £509 1 6s. lid.
Another of £l7O is made £570; another of £352 us lid,
is made £1352 os. lid., and so on. All simple and easy 1 A
child could do it!

Fifty-five pounds, in counterfeit shillings, has
been paid into a Melb. bank. They are good silver.

The latest alleged Southern defaulter, for
whose arrest a warrant is out, was a “pillar” of the
church and a Govmentouse young man. In the matter of
church work he was especially zealous, having been a
Sunday-school superintendent, with a predilection for
early morning communions and evening prayer meetings,
* * • *
Once upon a time the Akgds thought the banka
and the Argus were the only impregnable things in
Australasia. Now they know better. But they can’t see
clearly enough through their photosphere of financial
ignorance to perceive that the crude Credit Foncier Bill
of Carter’s is the beginning of a new era in banking and
borrowing.

William M‘Lean of Federal Bank and Baptist
Sunday-school fame, and W. G. Field, once M.L.A. for
Collingwood, have resigned as J.’sP. The world knows
why Mr. Field resigned, but why did Mr. M Lean?
Perhaps he had no longer any time to sign affidavits.

the matrimonial prize is a Cape Colony girl.
“ Queen Victoria,” says a recent Pearson’s
Weekly, “has been corsetless since her widow-
hood.” When she lost her prop and stays, as it
were.
Chief-Secretary Gordon, the most eloquent
of S. A. politicians, will be 44 years old on June
26, and Attorney-General O’Loghlen (V.) will be
66 next day.
The old feud is now sufficiently healed to
allow Premier Kingston (S.A.) and Legislative
Council President Baker to exchange words on
official business.
E. L. Montefiore, director of Sydney Art
Gallery, whom it is sought to make a C.M.G. or
something, was 25 years ago postmaster at “Ool-
lingwood Flat,” Melb.
Re Aspinall and Edinburgh, in many quar-
ters of Melb. the Duke is credited with paying
Aspinall for O’Farrell’s defence. If so, it’s about
the only thing he ever did pay.
One of Cetewayo’s greatest personal friends
resides at Fitzroy, Melb.—a Mr. L. J. Altman.
He lived with the dusky chief for some time, and
a child of his was born in Oetewayo’s kraal.
The bankrupt bard, Robert Buchanan
(brother to the “ Australian orator,” David
Buchanan) once provoked his whilom partner, G.
R. Sims, to speak of him as “ Buchananias.”
A Cundletown (N.S. W.) publican makes it
known that he is the man about whom poet
Kendall said : “ He has travelled and shows the
best influence of travel.” And he has now reached
Cundletown.
Judge Windeyer, of N.S.W. Divorce
Court, has unhitched 23 couples in five hours—
local record up to date. The Magisterial Police
Court drunk-record {l4O drunks an hour) begins
to feel nervous.
Up till the end of May—and he had then
been in office six months—National Ass Mayor
Wilcox, of Adelaide, had not given a single public
entertainment, although he receives <£looo a year
for that purpose.
Queensland is literally governed by fat
men. Not one of the present Ministry (barring
Wilson, the P.M.G.) measures less than 40in.
round the middle. And it would take many Wil-
sons to leaven the mass.
Gov. Robinson, of Westralia, is coming
East. It is believed the visit is largely connected
with the production of a new opera recently com-
posed by his Excellency. Do not the quarantine
laws apply in a case like this ?
James M‘Pherson Granc, who has just
resigned his position as associate to Justice Hol-
royd, Vic., is the only son of the late J, M. Grant,
the politician of Vic. land-law fame. Mr. Grant
intends to practise as a lawyer.
At the trial, in Sydney last week, of a
w«man for concealment of birth, the Judge who
tried her was an Innes, the associate who arraigned
her an Innes, and the counsel who defended her
an Innes. She was acquitted.
One Vic. Supreme Court Justice now
travels second-class on the railways. There was
some intention on his part, a little time ago, to
retire from the Bench and practise again at the
bar, on account of severe boom-time losses.
Prince Christian, eldest son of the Crown
jrrince of Denmark, is to marry the daughter of
the Princess of Wales. The inbreeding of this
clan is as shameless as that of the rabbits in Aus-
tralian Western wilds.
Mr. Nettleship, the eminent oculist, chosen
to operate for cataract upon Mr. Gladstone, is a
Maorilander, one of three gifted brothers. The
eldest was professor of classics at Oxford, and
met with an untimely end while climbing among
the Alps.
A certain M.P., who has just been im-
pressing upon his constituents the duty of
practising the loftiest and most ascetic morality,
happens to be the one man who can give a true
and vivid account of the Australian career of Lola
Montez.
Victoria has decided to retain awhile the
services of Government Statist Hayter on account
of his conspicuous ability. Meanwhile rumour
has it that F. H. Bruford (also a poet), of the
statistical branch of the Trade and Customs, is a
likely successor.
Two “leading” N.S.W. Freetrade poli-
ticians, it is said, have never been very friendly
since the time when one of them, as Minister,
dismissed the other’s near relative, who had been
appointed by “old Jack” Robertson to a depart-
mental sinecure.
Premier Patterson on his new ear-mark :
“ I disclaim any right to the distinction. I regard
it simply as a compliment to the colony.” Now,
if Queen Victoria had really any desire to please
the country she would have ennobbled Bent, and
completed the set.
A lofty military personage hints that the
rudeness he experiences at the hands of persons
accidentally at the head of civil affairs in Austra-
lian communities, is largely attributable to the
fact that arms have not yet won either glory or
profit for Australia.
The late Justice Peter Faucett, of N.S.W.
Supreme Court, never delivered a judgment which
was overruled on appeal to the Privy Council.
Several Australian Judges claim the same dis-
tinction, but then their judgments were never
carried to that tribunal.
Fred. Cali, ex-Melb. magistrate, is dead.
He was a very good J udge, with none of Panton’s
Weak streaks. and made not one memorable
mistake In a long career. Brough’s Magistrate,
pulling his Dundreary whiskers, was like him, or
rather like his somewhat pompous class.
Millionaire Silas Harding, who died at
Geelong (Vic.) on Friday last, was almost as great
a litigant as the murdered Joseph Bragge Slack.
Deceased’s squabbles with hia relatives furnished
great grist to the legal mill and made Harding’s
name the title of many Vic. leading cases.
The late Dr. Pearson first came to the
front in ’77 when Graham Berry raised the flag of
“ more Protection ” and more radicalism. It used
to stagger people to hear “revolutionary senti-
ments ” given out by the Professah in long-drawn
Oxford sentences, rounded off like slabs from an
historian.
One sympathises with the Victorian high
official who, when he became aware that a certain
officer of his had been to a hanging that morning
for mere curiosity’s sake, said to the messenger :
“Brown, please keep Mr. Smith out of my office
to-day—in fact, I don’t wish to speak to him for
the next three months.”
Gov. Hopetoun, as an old Etonian, gave a
largely-advertised dinner to the Etonians of Mel-
bourne the other day. As a few dozen of these in
that city had none of them received invitations,
inquiries were instituted, and the much-boomed
gorge was discovered to have been partaken of by
five men and three ladies.

he is rough enough, however the diamond may
be. Once, when M.L.C. for Woothakata, he ex-
cused his non-attendance at a previous sitting by
stating that he had been out the night before with
the Woolongabba “ push ” at a cock-fight.
In an action last week over a building
dispute (Braid v. Trestraill), Judge Hood (Vic.),
in order to settle a point on which plaintiff’s and
defendant’s evidence was, to say the least, contra-
dictory, adjourned the court, and in full regalia
climbed the scaffolding, inspected the roof, re-
turned to the Bench and gave his decision.
Edward Patten Adams, Anglican parson of
Hagley, Tas., has just passed over. As a preacher
he was commonplace, but as a man and a friend
he is entitled to a seat in the front rank. His
death has liberated many tales of unostentatious
kindness, until now secret. He was brother to
the judge, and also to the registrar of titles, both
of Hobart.
Police-Magistrate Badham, who, finding
himself compelled to put the old statute of
Charles 11, into operation against the Seventh
Day Adventists in Parramatta lately, burlesqued
the proceedings by ordering the lawbreakers to do
time in the stocks, has been removed from Parra-
matta. The official minute transferring him to
the West said nothing about the cause.
An adoring interviewer, taking dinner with
Robert Louis Stevenson :
Suddenly a terrible scuffle took place under the table,
and Henry, the cat, dashed out, followed by a strange
dog. In a minute Mrs. Stevenson was shouting for a
revolver, and generally impressing on the owner that she
would shoot the dog, and, should any harm come to
Henry, the owner also.
Evidently Ah Hell is wise in living in Samoa.
Emperor Alexander, of Russia, appears to
be the first potentate converted by Bulletin
arguments. His latest ukase is one dealing with
the conduct of criminal trials, and he there lays it
down that in all courts of his realm there must in
future be a Crown Defender as well as a Crown
Prosecutor, that both must be salaried by the year
independent of the number or character of the
cases heard, and that the salaries are to be equal.
Professor W. C. Kernot, Victoria’s greatest
engineering expert, and perhaps Melb. University’s
most talented graduate, was 49 on Saturday (June
16), and is still a bachelor, despite many caps set
at him. He is an intensely practical, manly man,
hence his gift of £2OOO to endow Melb. University
scholarships some seven years ago. He does not
believe in post-mortem benefactions, but in ante-
mortem gifts.
T. Bent is now on the Fine Art Com-
mittee of the Victorian National Gallery. Tommy
will probably be sole connoisseur of all the in-
fernally-crimsoned landboom-scapes which show
sanguinary perspectives of desirable allotments of
vermilion-coloured cabbages, watered by cochineal
rivulets, shaded by exanthematic foliage, and in
the foreground of which may be seen a Fat Man —
say Fink—artistically sitting on his hams.
Stout, Q. 0., the Maoriland ex-Premier

Afflicted with gout.
“ Teetotal yet gouty—

Apropos Call, P.M., Melb., just departed.
The funniest occurrence of his reign was that of
the electric table. Another beak took a case, in
Call’s room, and, said he: “This table is incon-
venient. Please shift it.” The united “foorce” had
a job nearly as tough as moving the Electric Lady,
the Georgia Magnet. They had positively wrung
it away, when Call rushed in, as if escaped from
Bedlam, his hair more on-end than ever. All his
complicated and expensive system of electric wires
had been torn up by the roots.
Rev. Fred. Hastings writes Adelaide
Advertiser from New Australia, Paraguay ;
A couple who had been married by Mr. Lane, as the
magistrate of the settlement, told me that they wished
they could have had some religious ceremony also. I
joined their hands in the open air, and in the name of
God solemnly pronounced them man and wife, saying,
“Whom God hath joined together let no man put
asunder.” They went away anyhow with the conscious-
ness that their union had the smile of the Divine Father.
When in Adelaide, Hastings was not known as a
timorous personage, but his self-confidence has
now become sublime.
On dit that Lord Kintore informed the
Colonial Office that Way, 0.J., intrigued for
appointment as Governor of S.A., and so it came
about that Mr. Way did not get the Privy Coun-
cillorship so confidently expected and so earnestly
desired. The fear of offending Downing-street
and Governors of the other provinces kept Mr.
Way from launching out into lavish hospitalities
during Kintore’s absence —he thought it might
look like bidding for popular support to his
nomination as Governor when the Earl goes.
Yet, after all his carefulness, comes this sad
rebuff. Enough to try the loyalty of even so
courtly and Imperialistic a personage as the Chief
Justice.
A travelling correspondent to The Bulle-
tin ;
Dr. Carl Von Sherzer, who visited Maoriland with
Hochstetter many years back and was also a member of
the Novara expedition and the Austrian expedition to
East Asia, the friend of Count P. E. Strzelecki, and last,
not least, of Baron Von Muller, lives now quietly at Genoa,
where he holds the position of Austrian Consul-General.
Despite his great age, Sherzer looks hale and
hearty and good for another ten years. The lapse of
years has not diminished his interest in the Australias
and the handbooks of the Australian states lying on his
desk look as if they had been much in use. Sherzer’s
well-known book, “Das Wirthschaftliche Leben der
Vdlker” (national economy of nations), is just being
translated into English.
Another anecdote of “ Goomalabee” Ryan.
Returning home one day at dinner-time he asked
one of his sons if he had done a certain piece of
work. The boy replied that he had forgotten
to attend to it ; whereupon “ Goomalabee ”
charged at him, but the boy quickly slipped out-
side and ran around the kitchen, hotly pursued by
his father. A pet ram belonging to the place
observed this sudden change in the monotony of
farm life, and, thinking the pair were engaged in
a friendly game of chevvy-chase, he joined in and
bumped around the kitchen after them, till, having
gained upon the old man, he butted him severely
and knocked him out of the running. “ Gooma'a-
bee ” scrambled to his feet, seized the frolicsome
head of the flock, and broke his neck. “There,”
he said, “five minutes ago you were worth .£3O,
now your pelt is your only value.”
From Adelaide Standard, “ Smiler ”
Hales’ religious organ :
As to the snarling, vermin-breeding jackalthat conveyed
the putrefying carrion to its gormandiser, in expectation
of the offal that might be thrown to it in return, the
Standard would just say that this lying hound in the
semblance of a man, who attempts to traduce a being as
immeasurably removed from himself as Heaven is, would
be proud to wash his festered, freckled face in the water
in which Smiler had cleansed his socks, and one of the
proudest moments of his life would be that wherein he
was permitted to act as “ slushy ”in Smiler’s camp. He
is a cringing, creeping, sneaking cad, brought haphazard
into the literary world ; and has no father in particular.
The Bulletin is happy to think that it was the
humble agent in adding the above beautiful prose
contribution to contemporary literature.
A curious fact, insisted upon by an official
visitor to Vic. lunatic asylums, is that the con-
stant association of medical officers with patients
at the rendezvous of insanity has the effect of
gradually destroying the mental faculties of the
former. As the result of much study, he divides
lapses to intellectual aberration into three periods.
An admittedly healthy medico will develope symp-
toms of influence in about seven years from the
time of entering upon regular asylum duties. In
fourteen years he is decidedly “dotty.” After
twenty years’ asylum service his mental derange-
ment is very pronounced, and he is then generally
allowed by a paternal Government to resign. In.
any case, whether he resigns or not, he has to be
looked after pretty much the same as any other
lunatic.
Silas Harding, the Geelong millionaire
squatter, was reluctantly torn from his pro-
perty by Death, the other morning. Bar-
ring a tendency to litigation, old Silas had
no weakness where money was concerned. A
meaner miser never walked. In the early Vic-
torian days he became famous for his dirty green
coat, a garment that had been made for him by a
woman in America, and which he wore until it
decayed from his person. When his poor wife’s
strength failed and she was forced to take to her
bed, Silas could hardly persuade himself to fetch
a doctor to diagnose the case. The doctor told the
curmudgeon to give his wife something to eat, for
he was actually starving her to death. On one his-
torical occasion Silas had friends coming to see him
at his home, so he bought two sample bottles of
wine, and afterwards repudiated the bill on the
ground that his friends didn’t like the brand. A
chapel building encroached upon one-inch of
Silas’s ground, the flock refused to pay a thumping
indemnity, so he forced a compromise by cutting
the encroaching gas-pipe during evening service.
Another old story of this awful man related to his
sale of iron made to one Parker. Not having
any small weights, Silas got over the difficulty by
putting his own authenticated carcase kito the
scale. Every time Silas got up to do duty for a
certain number of pounds and ounces he nearly
killed himself with his grunting efforts to make
himself heavier. Unfortunately, he didn’t die
then. He amassed riches for another 40 years, or
so, and ultimately flickered out at the age of 78.
Lawyer P. D. Phillips made an eloquent
defence of trial by jury the other day before a St.
Kilda {Melb.) society. He said that it was not
wanted that a man might be convicted on minute
or complicated or technical testimony; rather
than that the community’s sense of justice should
be jarred by judgment on testimony not the
clearest and most satisfactory, the suspect should
be set free.
Indigestion
may be the result of a variety of causes, debility
of the digestive tract, over mental work, nervous
prostration, excessive smoking, tea, or spirit
drinking. At any rate no matter what the cause,
the only treatment of any permanent benefit is a
restorative treatment, the remedy must possess
tonic, invigorating and strengthening properties.
This is not the case with any of the many purging
mixtures sold as dyspepsia panaceas, and this is
proved by their makers stating that the dose must
be increased until the desired effect is attained.
This is due to the nostrum being purely a cathartic,
and by continued use the stomach, liver, and
bowels become educated to the action of the medi-
cine and it gradually loses all effect. Clements
Tonic is quite distinct in its action, it assists
digestion, promotes the flow of gastric and pan-
creatic fluids, increases the secretion of bile and
thus assists the bowels to throw off the waste
matter; it strengthens the nerves, forms bone,
muscle and nerve tissue, and increases the appe-
tite. Clements Tonic is a natural restorative of a
debilitated system. Read the case of Mrs. T.
Watts, Woonona, N.8.W., who writes on March
23rd, 1893 : —I have suffered severely from indi-
gestion for the last three or four years. I was
unable to sleep, and had a continual languid!
feeling, loss of appetite, severe pains in the chest
and stomach, and was half of my time unable t<>
perform my household duties with any degree of
pleasure. I had the advice and medicine of
several doctors, but without receiving any benefit,.
Hearing Clements Tonic so highly spoken of for
the above complaint, I resolved to give it a trial.
I felt myself improving from the very first dose,
and am happy to say that befoie I had finished
the first bottle all disagreeable symptoms had
disappeared, and I felt better than I had done for
years ; I have never had a return of the old com-
{laint since. I recommend it on all occasions.—
remain, yours gratefully, Mrs. T. Watts,
Woonona, N.S.W.

from
LIVER COMPLAINT,
INDIGESTION,
CONSTIPATION,
HEARTBURN,
FLATULENCE,
Or any symptoms of a disordered digestive ap-
paratus? If so, there is no remedy in the world
so safe and sure to give relief as Fletcher’s Pills
and Clements Tonic. Don’t be misled into wasting
time and money on any of the “ All-failing ”
nostrums so speciously advertised by designing
quacks and dishonest rogues. Remember, these
two remedies have stood the test of time, that
their merits are proved, and that a few shillings
invested on them may save you weeks and months
of suffering, and, perhaps, pounds of expense, for
they have done so in hundreds of cases, and we
will send you evidence to prove our assertions on
receipt of your name and address. Remember,
delay is dangerous, and that every hour you neg-
lect your case the complication increases and a
cure becomes more difficult. Shun the cheap
quack doctors and designing nostrum compounders;
stick to the remedies Clements Tonic and Flet-
cher’s Pills. They are absolutely genuine’ and
have proved their efficacy in hundreds of cases and
will do so every time. They are sold everywhere
and made only by F. M. Clements, Newtown,

POLITICAL
POINTS
J.P. : Justice Prostituted.
Deakin : “ Patterson is a bladder painted
to look like a bomb.”
Up to date, Westralia owes £46 a head on
her population of 70,000 people.
Just at present S.A. Parliament has only
one conspicuous drunk in each chamber.
No one seems to have paid Patterson the
compliment of supposing that he might possibly
decline a badge. »■* '
Queensland has had six “surpluses”
during the past 15 years—and has run up close on
.£32,000,000 in loans.
When the N.S.W. Premiership falls to
Reid he will, some of his friends assert, exhibit
magnanimity by presenting the office to Parkes.
The latest Australian election promise :
“If ye choose me as your ripresintive I will make
yez so proshperuz ye can build yeer huts wid
loaves of bread and tatch ’em wid shteak.”
The Vic. Land-Tax Register, just pub-
lished, discloses the fact that very little land in
the province is officially reckoned “first-class,”
Most of it is given a bad name and so escapes
with a low tax.
Cardinal Moran affirms that “ the Church ”
never interferes with any political question unless
it involves a “ principle.” Which is a Hibernian
way of saying that “ the Church ” meddles with
all political questions.
S.A. Oppositionists riiake a great noise
about Playford’s precipitancy in “collaring ” the
Agent-Generalship. As a matter of fact, Premier
Kingston offered it to Speaker Coles, who refused
it before Playford was considered.
Tasmania, unlike the other provinces, does
not endorse its official envelopes with the mon-
archic O.H M.S. It imitates the old legend of
the Roman Republic, “Pro Bono Publico,” and
brands its official documents “On Public Ser-
vice.”
Rev. Presbyterian Cairns, of Ballarat: “To
dream of the time when wealth will be properly
distributed is to dream an impossibility. It is the
dream of the idle and worthless.” The poor are
solemnly advised to be reasonable and dream of
Heaven.
The Westralian “Journal of the Bureau
of Agriculture,” a State publication, recently
made Premier Forrest say : “I myself, and I am
the Government, have great sympathy with culti-
vators of the soil.” Of course they explained it was
a misprint.
The average hen-deputation, when it calls
■upon a Minister, generally does its business in
about half the time occupied by the male deputa-
tionist. The other day a crowd of ladies waited
on Premier Patterson, and got through seven
.speeches and a desultory conversation, and heard
the Premier’s answer, and got down the stair, all
in 35 minutes. At the same time a gathering of
male petitioners dropped in on Minister Webb
and made 22 orations to him, and the exhausted
politician didn’t get rid of them for 3jj hours.
“Hooey’’Tay-
lor, member for
Parramatta, lately
applied to Parkes
for a “political
testimonial,” and
got a very sugary
one, indeed. What
use he expects it
willbe tohimHooey
alone knows. No
business man takes
any notice of testi-
monials. They are
generally as mis-
leading as political
addresses, and just
about as true —it
not being always
diplomatic to write
the exact truth
about a man and
then hand it him to
read. The average
testimonial - writer
is either a hopeless
liar or a very brave
man. By-the-way,
if Hooey wanted a
testimonial very
badly he could have
got a nice one from
the inmates of
Parramatta Girls’
Industrial School.
He once went there
to quell a disturb-
ance. The police,
however, were be-
forehand, and when
the valiant Hooey
arrived they were
■ carting off sam e
do zen infuriated
females to the local lock-up, When the girls
■ caught sight of their esteemed member they left
off scratching the bobbies’ faces, and one called
for—“ Three —— cheers for Hooey Taylor, the
■best man in Parramatta !”
Vic. Customs authorities are disgusted
with the result of recent sly-grog prosecutions at
Korumburra. Nearly all the defendants took
out ” the heavy fines. In Victoria, just now, the
decrease of sin is nothing like so important as the
increase of revenue.
Sydney D.T., in an editorial, last week,
accidentally let slip the expression, in allusion to
N.S.W. legislators of the Foreign-trade faith—
“ many of the more candid Conservatives.” the
National Ass has been calling itself “the great
Liberal party, ’’and now one of its own special
organs gives it clean away.
Rev. Flockhart, of Armadale, Vic., has
been praying aloud for the Patterson Government.
“ Oh Lord, keep them from office-seeking and
quarrelling,” is the burden of his wail. The
existence of the Patterson Government is a certain
indication that the Lord doesn’t dabble in politics.
It was Simon Fraser, Vic. delegate to the
Canadian Conference, to whom Dibbs confided his
real scheme of Federation last week. Fraser
wrote about it to Patterson, at Dibbs’ request,
and Patterson gave it to the Vic. papers, with
strict injunctions to the reporters not to say where
they got it from.
Certain Bananaland organs have steeped
themselves in perjury to the very lips in support
of the sugar-planters’ first article of faith —that no
white man can do the work on a plantation. And
now these very organs are advertising for white
men to do the work of which they were previously
declared incapable.
Vic. Treasurer Carter recalls Wilberforce
Stephen, who was Chancellor of the Vic. Anglican
Church, when he brought forward secular educa-
tion. Carter used to be a crony of the Langtons,
Murray Smiths, Lorimers, and all the hard-shell
Tories. Now, here he is posing as the Socialist,
with his Credit Foncier.
No one believes the Patterson Govern-
ment to be serious in its Credit Foncier proposals.
It is a foregone conclusion that the Upper House
will squelch the measure, but the Ministry s pur-
pose will have been served, since it only wants to
be able to take credit at the near-at-hand general
election for “making an effort.”
A Victorian M.L.A. recently complained to
his constituents that he had had to do all the
work in getting a certain railway line sanctioned,
yet the line was carried for the most part through
another member’s electorate. This other man, the
orator suggested, was unworthy of so much rail-
way. He had not worked for it.
Were all Labour’s antagonists as straight-
out and uncompromising as the blunt, brutal, and
politioally-foolish Frank Madden, speedy victory
to the Democrats would be Assured. Such oppo-
nents as he are invaluable to his adversaries, who,
through such blundering frankness, find out the
real views and feelings of the other side.
M‘Lellan, M.L.A; (Vic.) describes Shiels
as “a man who goes into the bush for six months
to prepare a speech, and then goes back to the
bush for another six months to recover after
delivering it.” One of Shiels’ great speeches
takes about as much out of his constitution as
seven days’ exposure on a raft in mid-ocean.
The Westralian Ministry will hardly be
satisfied with the result of the local elections,
which show that with the inward flow of the
Eastern barbarians the beginning of the end ha,s
come. But it is not all over yet with the Mini-
sterialists, one at least of whom represents a con-

The other day, at Blackall (Q.), about
27,000 acres of land,were sold for .£13,000, for the
benefit of a depleted southern Treasury. If
Separation be not granted speedily Central
Queensland will soon be beyond all hope
redemption, inasmuch as her best lands will be in
the possession of Southern capitalists, who will
practically govern the country from Southern
headquarters.

The comedy of politics. Within the last
two years Parkes has declared Barton untrust-
worthy on the question of Federation, and Barton
has declared Parkes a deceiver of a similar brand,
and yet to-day, without any apology for the
mutual vilification of the past, they embrace on
public platforms and unblushingly proclaim tha 1
both are wholly trustworthy on that particular
question. All an enemy of Federation need do to
rout the pair is to quote Parkes against Barton,
and Barton against Parkes.
The latest Yic. Railway scheme is another
case of diverting the Western district trade from
poor old Geelong (its natural port) toSmellbourne,
the boa-constrictor city. Yet a righteous protest
against the job brings Bailes, M.P., Bendigo
pub.-keeper, to his feet with the remark that he
“can’t understand this anxiety to bolster up
Geelong at the expense of the rest of the colony,”
and nobody has the grace to blush at the grog-
vendor’s bluff. The truth is that all-Victorian in-,
terests are sacrificed to Melbourne’s dread of a
Geelong rivalry, a matter for which the “great ”
newspapers are largely, to blame. Y ~

The Burke election leaves no doubt what
N.Q. voters think of Q.N. Boodle Government.
Billy Little, who sold his birthright as a repre-
sentative miner for a mess of MTlwraithian pot-
tage, could only get 81 votes to 312 given Glassey,
the leader of the Q. Labour-party in last Parlia-
ment. And this in spite of a patent bribe con-
veyed in a telegram which Little flaunted from
Minister of Mines Philp, to the effect that “ the
Govt, would assist deep sinking on the Etheridge,
and strongly advocate building a railway to
Georgetown, not on the land-grant system, but by
the Govt.” Glassey had, too, the disadvantage of
being a Southerner, personally unknown to the
constituency. But it is a tough job, now, to
delude the N.Q. democracy.
Sydney Bakers’ Union has entered on a
dangerous course in trying to boycott non-union
employers. To begin with, the ordinary house-
keeper does not often care whether she buys union
or non-union made bread. All her practical
sympathy is in her own pocket. Then she c'annot
always change her baker at will. She is often
deeply in his debt, and if she discard him, he may
make things unpleasant. The employers who
have stuck to the union men may throw them
over. Finally, it is by no means certain that the
law may not have something to say to the distri-
bution of black-lists. In any case, the union
bakers themselves seem to be by no means unani-
mous about the boycott —l5O present at the
meeting that resolved on it, and only 43 votes in
its favour, and 2 against it. What do the 105
silent members think?
Labour-candidate Watson will positively
go to the poll for Cook Division, Sydney—in
which case, presumably, journalist Traill will be
beaten, and the bourgeois boot-importer Whiddon
will get in. The question for the Labour party
to consider is which they prefer Traill or
Whiddon. Apparently theyhave considered it, and
prefer Whiddon. The Bulletin’s former long
association with Traill will not deter it from re-
marking that in this matter it is sorry for the
Labour party. Traill’s virile pen has been of
inestimable service to the Democratic cause in
Australia, and his only sin is that he is not a
manual labourer or a hanger-pn to some manual
labourers’ association. It disgusts men who earn
their living with their brains to find Parliament
being turned, so far as the hand-workers are con-
cerned, into an institution where blatant hodmen
learn to play dominoes.
The work of Labour-disintegration goes
merrily on in N.S. Wales. Notwithstanding that
Black, Schey, and Houghton have signified their
willingness to sign a reasonable pledge, they are
branded as “ bogus” and will be opposed by the
bumptious “ Central Executive to the certain
annihilation of the Labour interest in these con-
stituencies. This is so obviously unjust to the
three members named, and so suicidal to the
Labour cause, that even the Workman, the official
organ of the league, is imploring that inflated
and unrepresentative body to reconsider its atti-
tude. Than Black the Labour-party has had no
more valuable or consistent member; than Schey,
no more energetic worker. Their offence is not
against Labour, but against Labour’s arrogant
bosses. “The Cause” apparently is no longer
Labour, but Labour-leagueism.
MTlwraith, during his recent visit t<r
England, had the gall to announce that the
Queensland democrats were opposed to manhood

In the comparatively lean days of very long ago
he was reasonably accurate ; now ! !!

Apart from the Unionist question
there could never be any sym-

The one is a genuine lord who
respects radicalism; the other is
a bogus radical, with an ignoble
passion for lordliness. Joe’s orchid

that beats under it, whilst the
Primrose peer tries to feel as a

During an electioneering
campaign in western N.S.W.,
years ago, the retiring member
had lost popularity and could
not get a hearing. Presently a
voice of thunder was heard above
the din : “ What have you done
for years?” “ What have I,done ?”
yelled the ex-member, “I will
show you,” and suiting the action
to the words he emptied a chaff-
sack of documents over the plat-
form. “There!” he shouted,
“ there are the letters I answered
for you 1” The applause was
electrical as it was hearty ; the
tide was turned, and the member
returned. It only came out after-
wards that the documents were
bills and receipts. But, luckily,
they fell into the hands of sup-
porters.
Jos. 0ook ; M.P., the N.S.W. Labour-
leader, won’t sign the pledge of Holman and Co.,
who are just now in business as Parliamentary
seat-jumpers. So they went to his constituency,
Hartley, to “ down ” him. A meeting of electors
was called, and a motion having for its object the
formation of a new Labour League was lost—
the Labour electors expressed themselves satisfied
with Cook. But this didn’t suit the Holman
crowd, who are establishing a new league all the
same. The end of the matter will likely be that
Holman’s man won’t get in and Cook won’t get in
either, but Hurley will get in. And so it will be
in a dozen “Labour” constituencies.
Parkes is spreading a comprehensive poli-
tical net. He now asks the public to “ vote for
good men, whether Protectionists or Freetraders,”
and he was billed as chairman for Pastor Isitt,
the Maoriland teetotal apostle, who has come to
Australia to advocate prohibition—in other words,
the uprooting of the Australian vineyards. He
might as hopefully preach the extinction of all
Australian sheep, or the making of gold-mining a
felony. Parkes, the posturing humbug, who never
feels so well as when he has under his belt two big
bottles of Burgundy, knows this, yet he had the
chilled steel cheek to publicly take under his
wing the teetotal boss.

The manager of Sydney Benevolent Society
struck one of the richest patches of the season
when he suggested that the State should legalise
affiliation to putative fathers before birth in
illegitimacy cases. Hitherto the production of
the baby has been looked upon as the safeguard of
justice. If a red-haired infant confronted a red-
haired defendant, that defendant went down.
What country benches will do when they can’t
compare the alleged father’s phyzog. with that of
his alleged offspring can only be surmised. If
paternity is to be recognised before birth—at what
stage before birth ? Where does defendant’s
liability begin—and where (counting-in all the
eventualities and contingencies) does it cease?
The Bulletin hopes to hear this question fully
discussed when the first dozen women are returned
to Parliament.

It was lately announced that “the re-
spectable portion of the population ” of Burrowa,
N.S.W., strongly approved of the stand taken by
the Executive re the hanging of burglars Mont-
gomery and Williams. Burrowa is almost ex-
clusively inhabited by Irish gentlemen of so pug-
nacious a type that on one occasion they actually
had heaps of road-metal carted to the race-course
the day before the races, in order that the des-
cendants of the various rival kings might have
proper facilities for a fair foight. Ever since the
local blacks were supplanted by the Irish gentle-
men aforesaid everything has been done in a most
emphatic way at Burrowa. For instance, if you
stayed at the hospitable mansion of Mr. Nagle
Ryan, the lately-deceased King of Burrowa,
you were awakened at daylight by a nobleman
hitting you over the nose with a pannikin. When
you opened your eyes you found that he expected
you to help yourself out of a bucket of rum-and-
milk which he was carting round to the numerous
bedrooms of the house.

In a Melbourne
maintenance case last
week the complainant’s
30-year-old son deposed
that “ during the early
part of his life he was
known by the maiden
name of his mother,
whom he then thought
was a sister, while he
was under the impression
thatjhis grandmother was
his mother.” Whereupon
the lady cried, “Oh !
Freddy, how can you say
such a thing?” This is
the first recorded instance
of a woman objecting to
the idea that she had
passed as her son’s sister
—unless D. C. Murray’s
tale of “Joseph’s Coat”
is supposed to be founded
on fact. As a rule, she
would like herself and
offspring to get taken for
twins. If she is very
artless, and the son
grows a lot of beard,
it wouldn’t be a hard
matter to persuade her
that he was “ dear papa.”
Did you ever notice
how an early-middle-aged
matron considersher first-
born “absurdly big,” as
though ordinary growth
were a freak of Nature and a criminal libel on
the whirligig of Time.
One Sydney restaurant now gives soup, a
choice of five joints, with potatoes, cabbage, bread
and tea—all for 3d. The food is rough but good ;
and one day last week the rush of customers was
so great that it broke the stove. One of the pro-
prietors is cook; the other waiter ; and with no
wages and a small rent to pay they are making a
living. Hardly any of the higher-priced restaur’
ants do much more than pay expenses. Clerks
and others who used to pay Is. every day for
lunch now go in fours into an hotel, and share a
quart of ale for Is., making a good meal from the
free-lunch counter. Waiters’ wages are lower
than ever, averaging 13s. to 17s. for women per
week, 20s, to 275. for men. Meals are given in,
but the hours are generally 13 a day, Sunday
included, with one Sunday in a blue moon off.
The best hotel in Sydney only pays 275.

The savage who struts proudly among his
savagesses in all the glory of beads and feathers is
nothing to the semi-civilised military hero—pro-

yearns to bedizen himself with gold lace and
become the cynosure of ballroom belles. A fright-
ful outrage on army decorum has just been com-
mitted by a number of N.S.W. soldiers, who are
only entitled to wear silver lace, and who had the
presumption to tell their tailors to make them

One great objection to the use of camels in
Queensland is that the animal with the hump often
takes a sulky fit, and can then only be induced to
proceed by the very gentlest of persuasiveness. An
Afghan may be seen softly soothing an obstinate
camel as delicately and tenderly as if he were
wooing a coy maiden. Just fancy Bullooky Bill,
whose breath is sulphur and whose language is
pure, undiluted Sheol, trying to drive a camel
without having recourse to 10 feet of whip and
10 yards of profanity. It’s quite unthinkable.
Wilson, Bananaland Minister for Educa-
tion, is a subtle dialectician. The other day
he issued a ukase to the effect that draw-
ing was to be taught in State schools. By
way of apology for the innovation he adds :
“Drawing may be regarded as coming under the
head of writing, which is only another form of
drawing." How Wilson would stare if the
Bananaland pedagogues objected on the ground
that they were already teaching drawing—which
is only another form of writing !

Recently (in North Karnschatcka), a Judge
and a Crown Prosecutor arrived per boat at a
small coast town in the middle of the night. Both
were so obfuscated that, after climbing on shore,
they refused to go further, but sat on the wharf
calling dismally for a cab—although the nearest
cab was over 100 miles away. After about half-
an-hour’s persuasion they were finally lodged in
the hotel and put to bed ; but just as the crowd
was departing, the C.P. appeared on the veran-
dah “ mid nodings on,” and, after offering to fight
any two blank ecteteras in the crowd, fell heavily
over a chair. It is little episodes of this sort
which make a Judge so courteous and amiable on
the judgment-seat at 11 a.m. next day.

Here is another true judge-story. Many
hundred years ago, a lady, about to visit an ad-
joining province, let her house furnished to a
dernure-looking, grey-haired matron with three
daughters, all fine, stylish girls, and set off
satisfied. After a fortnight or so, she began to
receive notes from her old neighbours complaining
of the hansom-traffic at night, and inquiring
whether she approved of poses piastiques on thefront
verandah on warm evenings, or comic choruses at
2 a.m. Result, she returned post haste, forthwith
expelled the high-priestess of Venus and her
acolytes with ma'ny indignant snorts, and, pend-
ing the arrival of a new tenant, resumed occupa-
tion. Next evening there was a ring at the door
and a well-dressed, elderly gentleman, with a
clean-cut face, was ushered by the servant into
the drawing-room. The lady was not prepared for
company, and hardly had she retired to’her room
to “fix herself up” ere another visitor arrived.
And the newcomer appeared to be well acquainted
with his senior, for they sat together at the piano
and sang “ Hi-tiddley-hi ” while one played. In
the middle of it in walked the householder, who
inquired freezingly : “ To what am I indebted for
the honour of this visit?” “Hullo, Ma!” said
the elder,” “ we just looked in—where’s the girls?”
“ There are no girls here,” she replied in icy tone?,
“ and, Sir Blanker Blankington, if you are look-
ing for Mrs. De Snoozle, I am afraid I can give
you and Chief Justice Asterisk no information
regarding her whereabouts. Good evening.”

JKe little Dr. Ren wick’s notion of a

“Lady Bumble.” “That is an address, madam —
not a signature. Write your name only.” “ That's
my name. I won’t sign any other way 1 ” And,
rather than drop the handle, she went away and
got a “ bearer ” cheque.

It has long been patent to Northerners
that the Kanaka traffic causes one half of the

causes the remaining half of the male Polynesians
on the islands to become polygamists, inasmuch
as the surplus female population must necessarily
be taken to somebody's bosom. The swell Poly-
nesian chief approves hugely of a harem.

At Longford, Tas., not many weeks since,
writes a correspondent, two little maids were
struggling along with a full basket of mushrooms
when they were bailed up by the Pat Man who

THE WAITRESS.
Her lips were sweet and juicy
And singularly red ;
A pretty girl was Lucy.
“ A steak, I think you said; “
H ;r figure straight and slender
One could not but remark.
“ You’ll find it nice and tender,”
She whispered to the clerk.
Her hazel eyes had lashes
That swept a damask cheek;
Their swift and sudden flashes
Did eloquently speak.
She fixed her tresses wavy
In quite the latest style.
“ I’m sure it’s full of gravy,”
She added, with a smile.
He ate his early dinner
And drank a cup of tea ;
“ My darling,” said the sinner,
“ What’s tender steak to me 1
Your lips look ripe and juicy ” -
She took away his plate- -
“Id like a * lemon,’ Lucy ;
Will you be ‘ off ’ at eight ? ”
Her laugh was truly killing ;
A muslin cap she wore—
“ Your ticket is a
Please pay it at the door."
He took his bill and stuttered,
Then solemnly he went.
The haughty virgin muttered,
“ A leman's what he meant.”

Where the soft shadows of the dusk begin
Head pillowed in a shawl of sunburnt hair,
By art and gamboge made supremely fair.
The swooning eyes revealing all therein,
Scarlet, consenting lips, and dimpled chin.
The jewelled throat and throbbing bosom bare,
Forsaken by a robe without compare,
Adding fresh lustre to the charm therein.
Thine outstretched arms invite a mad embrace,
From parted lips words of enchantment fall.
Thy speaking breasts for burning kisses call;
And I, in bondage, gaze upon thy face—
Thy lily neck, and all thy girlish grace,
While thou art but a picture on the wall.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IB IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the'family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
seveupence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at
JJORDaBRW’S ?

How to Get a Piano or Organ.
'V'OU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
■t touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have DURABILITY. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for wfiich there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

The British War Office has included Joshua

A rule has been made in the S.A. Postal

All the rage now with Sydney “society”
is broken china, for drawing-room ornamentation.
Painted frying-pans and rolling-pins, etc., have
had their day. One Sydney wholesale glass-ware
importer sells this assorted rubbish at 2s. fid. per
barrel. Previous to the advent of the fad he sent
away two loads a week at a cost of 3s. fid. each,
for cartage. He sells every scrap of it now.

Lord Kintore apologised to Mrs. Fletcher,
widow of Rev. Roby Fletcher, M. A., for his in-
ability to send the vice-regal carriage to he*

the mockery of expressing regret at being unable
to manifest sorrow per medium of horses, landau,
and coachman! Even a Governor should at least
do his own weeping.

A lunacy-certificate issued in another pro-
vince contained the statement that the patient
(female) had made “unbecoming overtures” to
the doctor signing the document. Lunacy-clerk,
to amu-e his fellows, affixes memo.—“ Certificate
informal. Should state whether doctor complied
or not.” Memo.—overlooked —reaches head of
department, and, so sacred a thing is “ tape,”

A jealous Sydney girl, the other evening,
drew a large table-knife across the throat of her
faith'ess lover, gashing it “ almost from ear to
ear” (newspap>rese language). She had caught
him walking out with another girl, and when
“ taunted with the infidelity he replied in a mock-
ing manner.” The hard-hearted man is recover-
ing. It is as well that this young lady knew
nothing of anatomy. It is pretty hard to kill a
man by cutting his throat; if you want to do the
deed effectually you should rather cut his neck.

The ring of life that holds us now
Will not for ever stay ;
Reaction treads on action’s heels
As darkness dogs the day.
I love ; you heed not; cruel maid,
You laugh at my despair;
On Fate’s well-brink, my tyrant, pause!
Of Time’s wheel-turn beware 1
For Time will yield to other Time,
And Fate will balance ruth ;
Then I may be the scornful maid,
And you the alighted youth !

you won’t, for you would certainly drag some awful

G.S.P. : Will print Ad.: The writer recalls 15 aggres-
sively-virtuous boys of his school-days, and now two of
them are in gaol, two are bank directors, one is a local
preacher, and several are in Parliament. Taken all round,
the most respectable and trustworthy ones are the fellows
in gaol. This is a melancholy fact, but it is a fact all
the same. Isn’t your experience the same?. —D. :
“Geoffrey Hamlyn ” is the middle-class English novel of
a by-gone style and day. It has nothing Australian but
the scenery ; the characters are puppets dressed to Eng-
lish notions ; and it leaves the impression that Australia
is still an English appanage for younger sons and black-
legs to come out and be lords over. There is never a
gleam of Cholly. the jackaroo, who bobs up every year
with the same old insolence and starts to milk the same
old bull. It has no artistic merit, no literary finish ; and the
whole of it isn’t worth the brace of pages in “ His Natural
Life” which tell how Tommy and Billy “did it.” The

you are minotaurisd... Ad., Bud., Nickie Ben: The

M‘Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
The sales this week were attended by the usual number
of buyers, and, in some cases, competition was decidedly
brisk. ,
Prices for greasy regained the slight depreciation oi
last fortnightly series. The demand for scoured was
slightly easier.
The Antwerp sales have opened with a good demand at
prices equal to those ruling at February series. This is
the first piece of good news the cable has furnished us
with for a long time, and is quite cheerful to contemplate.
Of course, the present Sydney wool market cannot be
taken as a criterion for the coming reason, and we still
think no immediate rise in prices must be looked for.
When once more we have our stores full, and all the
manufacturing centres of the world represented here,
eager to purchase, we believe we will be in a position to
quote wool at least a little higher.
Sydney, June 15, 1894.
“Women Have Hard Times!”
The Minister who made this declaration from
the pulpit knew the truth of what he said.
Woman’s lot is a hard one socially, morally and
physically.
Much op her existence is monotonous and filled
with cares or sorrow.
She seems born to suffer, created for pain and
fitted to endure.
It is fortunate that she is so endowed, forshe
certainly has many sorrows and great suffering.
There is the mysterious development of girlhood,
the care of maternity and the change which
comes as she grows older.
Very often, too, she is thrown upon her own
resources, without protection, without assistance,
and without a friend.
What a great cause for thankfulness it should be
that scientific discovery has given her the best
friend that any woman has ever had.
pr is “ a friend in need.”
L* ,u friend certain to aid.
It a friend for her girlhood, her maternity, and
her later years.
It has been the best friend to millions of women
during the last twenty years.
It is that grand, that reliable remedy, Warner’s
Safe Cure.
IVomen WHO were weak, worn, weary, have been
made strong, bright and happy by its aid.
Women who felt despondent and melancholy have
been made cheerful and joyous through its
friendly power.
Women upon whose faces could be seen the expres-
sions of care, the paleness of pain, have been
made bright, joyous and happy by its reliable
aid.
Women whose lustreless eyes have shown the
beginnings of despair, have been made youthful
by the magical power of this true friend.
Is it any wonder that this great Safe Cure has
become so popular ?
Is it at all surprising that it is used so universally
to-day ?
Ask any woman of your acquaintance and she
will frankly tell you what we now say : That
this great Safe’Cure has become so popular
among women entirely because it has proved itself
to be
“Her Best Friend."

He replied he had called on W, H. Paling & Co.,

Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-poo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Pitt and Park streets,

Abigail and Co., the Sydney bogus-bank orooks,
will, It seems certain, be released almost at once. Why!
Chiefly because this is N.S.W. general-election time, and
they were all politicians. There are lots of less dangerous
people in Darlinghurst prison for whom there is no mercy.
If the Dibbs Government are prepared to deal out even-
handed justice they will publish a complete list of the
confines in N.S.W. gaols and have the case of every friend-
less wretch brought under public attention.

The Commercial Bank of Australia’s 10-year
deposits were sold, the other day, in the open market,
for 10s. in the £. Which means that, in the buyer’s
opinion, the fate of the bank by the year 1904 is practi-
cally a toss-up.
• e a •
The next great trouble among the banks should
arrive in 1808,1809, and 1900. In these three troubled
years nearly £34,000,000 of deposits will fall due, and if
they pass over without disaster there ought to be a
period of rest and quiet to follow. But the probabilities
are that five of the weaker institutions won’t see the last
of the century. There ought to be a great funeral about
the year '99.

R. Hope Atkinson, the Sydney gentleman
whose fraudulent lottery got away with so much public
money, has been gaoled for a year, and his colleague,
George Morris, for nine months, with hard labour in each
case. Tub Bulletin was the first paper which drew
attention, to the glaring swindle which these two persons
were conducting, and it kept on drawing attention to it
persistently in the hope of rousing the authorities to
action. This was in the very early stages of the affair,
when it might have been suppressed without serious loss
to the public. The Law Department, however, let the
unlawful game go on until Atkinson had scooped in and
spent every penny that was obtainable, and then it
roused up to sudden and vigorous action. Which mode
of procedure, by the way, is characteristic of the Law
Department.

You can forgive a man absolutely saturated with
the idea that he has abigpilein hand for failing, even in the
face of clear evidence, to instantaneously disabuse himself
of his illusion. But Mt. Hoaxley will teach a lot of people
a lesson learnt by every man sooner or later: “ Lay to
your book. ” When it is (or was, until lately) so easy to
t,ake in old and practised miners, you can’t expect town-
bred traders, who have never before seen a mine, to snifl
salt. Mr. Samuel’s unshaken faith in the golden Mount,
which was to reduce the value of sovereigns, is only one
of many circumstances tending to prove his honesty. It
was hard for Mark Hammond to believe that the salters
“ had ” him at the Last Call, but all the same they did
take him down just as they have taken down Mr.
Samuels; but you don’t hear anyone—not even those who
lost their money—saying that Hammond was not an abso-
lutely innocent agent in the matter.
Salting is one of the fine arts. The Bulletin
knows one set of mining sportsmen who have always
hacked their opinion freely, who were going to put up a
big plant after most exhaustive teats extending over
months. Now they hesitate—in fact, they have backed
down for the present. “ How do we know?" they ask.
A mistake would cost them £15,000.

If Tas. Government Geologist Montgomery’s
first inspection destroyed the hopes of Mount Hoaxley
shareholders, his second has damned them utterly.
“ Tunnel salted from end to end ; proved beyond doubt;
very little gold in virgin country,” is his harsh, unfeeling
way of putting things. Promoter Samuels’ faith is “still
unshaken,’’ however; and one Sydney investor who
dropped £660 —paying £6O for £25 shares—is reported to
be consoling himself with the idea that Montgomery is
“ an old-school geologist," and can’t smell out gold like a
new-fangled expert. Very likely; but he seems to be
able to smell salt.

connection with the Mount Huxley salting case, yet even
now Mr. Samuel’s faith in his stupendous mine seems un-
abated. A cold, dank misery, however, has fallen on
the bulk of the co. A few days ago, no one
could sit for five consecutive minutes on the steps
of Sydney G.P.0., at any hour of the day,
without an exuberant shareholder, or six exuberant
shareholders, tearing past. Now you can’t find a Mount
Huxley shareholder unless with the aid of a bloodhound.
They all, with the solitary exception of Mr. Samuel, go
stealthily down back lanes, and dodge mysteriously round
corners to avoid the consolatory remarks of their friends.
Samuel remains sufficiently visible, but the others are
nowhere.

A funny announcement was the statement that
Sydney shareholders in Mt. Hoaxley “had determined
not to part with their interests.” A parallel would be
something like this: “Cow Fat, the Chinese sent to the
lazarette last week, has, we hear, emphatically decided
not to part w ith his leprosy at any price."
• • • *
That Huxley has been extravagantly boomed
and vilely and clumsily, not to say extravagantly, salted,
is evident. That there were some grounds for economical
prospecting is quite probable. But that the Mount will
never be more than a one or two dwt. to the ton field,
has been, and is still, the opinion of many level-beaded
miners who have been there.

Apropos of the Mount Huxley mine, reported to
be a “ mountain of gold," do the shareholders of the
defunct Taranganba Proprietary G.M. Co. remember their
reported 11,000,000 tons of stuff running nowhere under
40z., and in many parts up to 60oz. ? Do they remember
how those brilliant reports verified after the public had
bought in at colour only ? Do they think of their final
dividend of nine-sixteenths of a penny on shares which
coat them 15s. ? and does the unerring criterion of guilt,
eui hono fuerit, run in their minds at all? Poor old
deluded Theodore Kanft, who made the assays, fully
believed in his marvellous results—but he died penniless.
Whereat Blank, Dash and Asterisk (Taranganba share-
holders know their real names) are alive, rich and
respected.

By 19 votes to 9 Tas. Government has refused to
guarantee the Mount Lyell debentures, (he chief contra
argument being that the £600,000 loan which the Govt,
must place early next year would be affected. This leaves
the directors as they were; for the mine yields, though
good, are not large, and until they increase it will be hard
to find local capital to build the railways so much needed
to reduce expenses.

If the London directors of the Greta mine at
Newcastle (N.S.W.) cannot pay decent wages and work

No right of property should be acknowledged in Aus-
tralian minerals unless the owners or lessees will work the
minerals. The reply to absentee dog-in-the-mangerism
should be prompt lease-cancellation or freehold re-
sumption.

Wyalong continues to bulk big in the papers

night and day, and another six stampers are being put
up. It is estimated there are 1500 tons of stone at grass,
and more ooming up every day than the battery gets
through ; but people hesitate about putting more money
into crushing appliances until they are sure of water and
the quality of the stuff.

A Coolgardie man to The Bulletin under date

• • • ♦
Coolgardie, where the fittest (men and mines)
are surviving, forges ahead. A year or so ago the town
consisted chiefly of a tent-store, where hideously-ranoid
bacon was sold at 4s. per lb.; to-day it has a newspaper,
20 iron stores, 6 hotels, 3 banks, 11 public condensers,
two butchers, four bakers, two blacksmiths, three doctors
and four chemists. There are also auctioneers, who seem
to do well selling off the outfits of the returning and dis-
appointed. It is quite settled now that Coolgardie is no
place for the moneyless amateur or the fainthearted to go
to; all the same, remarks a Buldctin correspondent,
the place will rank among the Eldorados of the world.
From Coolgardie South to Dundas and Lake Lefroy
and north to the 90 Mile is simply a network of
gold-bearing reefs. The place is as yet very isolated,
but a railway looms ahead, and the water difficulty
is not nearly so serious as it has been, for salt
water is being obtained in greater abundance.
Then our correspondent proceeds to grind his little axe;
“ I am interested in a property of which much will yet
be heard in the east. It is within 1J miles of the town-
ship and adjoins Moon’s. The reef is, on an average,
lift. wide. The main shaft is down 60ft. and carries a
splendid show of thickly-disseminated fine gold right
through from the surface— a permanent and good crush-
ing reef. The stone at grass, 300 tons, is an imposing
show; the mine is worked by its owners.” One con-
clusion is inevitable: If Coolgardie hasn’t got plenty
good reefs it has a fine stock of liars. A Sydney broker
who has just got back says he saw there scores of fine
shows, but the water-trouble still prevails, and he advises
people to stay away for two years to come.

A capable and reliable correspondent writes
•from Cue, W.A., on May 1:—-“ This field extends for 130
miles from N. to S., is very scattered, and the centres far
apart, so you must carry blanket, billy, and waterbag
everywhere. There are not many permanent people on
this part, but continual ‘strings’ are going and coming.
The English johnnie and general newchum are very
plentiful; while sharks, including the man who
was very ‘great’ somewhere else, abound. Cue and
Four-Mile are rival townships; both of the most
one-eyed description. The fact that seven doctors find
work and make money speaks for itself. Two small tents,
doing duty for an hospital, are crowded with 14 patients,
and numbers are being attended to by their friend* at
home. Fever is rife, and deaths common. The fact that
the field hangs in the balance, combined with high car-
riage and scarcity of fodder, keeps everything at famine
price* (chaff is sold at £2 per cwt). The gold shoots are
yery narrow, and confined one to a fissure. The clean,
white quartz has what are called bug-holes, where the
gold often lies loose in carbonate of iron. Without it I’ve
not seen a colour, the bug-hole then being crystallised.
Men who get the bang of it can collect nearly all the gold
in a shoot—hence the secret of the dolly. The formation
of the shoots is as varied as their number. They are
found in sandstone and diorite, desert sandstone, kaolin,
and slate. In no instance did I see a joint, or anything like
slippy walls, all showing signs of having been torn out by
the hair of the head. I had a talk to some slate people ;
they are getting no gold, but have a great reserve on
their holding—for what reason was not stated. Nothing
Is a better key to the value of a new field than the
administration of the mining laws. Here they are lax
in the extreme ; exemption everywhere, and on the most
miserable pretences, water and machinery, everything—
and anything, but the first causes, bad formation and
want of gold to stimulate industry. The deepest hole I
hear of is 213(t. on the underlay; they have a big capital,
yet all about is so mean and cooky that our crowd don’t
think it is any good. It certainly doesn’t look like it.
Several crushings are reported within the fortnight, some
as low as Sdwts., others as high as 4oz. 7dwts. There
are so many ways of working up those trials that one
never knows if they are correct. Most of the places they
came from are "wanting.” The machinery at present on
this part of the field are—Day Dawn, 10-head; Francis
Reward, an Otis; Public, 10-head ; Cue G.M. Co., 3-head.
That some of the fissures are worth prospecting I readily
admit, among them the Day Dawn."

Thomas M‘llwraith says that Canadian private
railway management is a revelation to him. “On one line
goods are carried long distances at the rate ol a farthing,
and a profit of one-eighth ol a penny per ton per mile.
The secret of this seems to be the avoidance of steep
gradients and sharp curves.” This is just where the
adipose Thomas goes wilfully astray. The secret lies in
getting practically the whole cost of the famous Grand
Trunk railway, which is the one above alluded to, out of
the State in the form of subsidies, so that the Co., to all
intents and purposes, get a present of the line. The
Canadian lines cost far more to build than those of Aus
tralia, and they only yield about half the interest on the
cost of construction. The State subsidy makes all the
difference.

CELLULAR CORSETS.
The Cellular Corset, fitted throughout with real whalebone, gives support
without impeding respiration. It allows perfect freedom of action, and pos-
sesses the additional advantage of being porous, by which it is rendered cool
in summer and warm in winter. The structure,
though soft and supple, retains its shape to the
last. The Cellular Corset is excellent for walking,
riding, dancing, tennis, and, indeed, for all active
games and exercises.

A Vie. writer, taking South Australia as a
criterion, tries to demolish the tote, but his two columns
only furnish arguments in favour of the machine, lie
says that without it there would be no racing in Adelaide,
and then speaks of the hardships it inflicts on the book-
makers. Now. which is the more injurious to the hooit-
maker—no racing at all, or racing with the tote I He
next complains that when the tote and the bookmakers
work side by side the public do not gam much because
the bookmakers hedge on the machine and, possessed of
better knowledge, get the lion’s share of the dividends.
Good. This reminds us of the quack who disdains his
own medicine and seeks advice from a reputable doctor.
The article winds up by saying that nothing should be
done at present, but that Victoria might as well try the
tote when the two leading clubs were no longer paying
their way. Which suggests the wisdom of looking the
stable when the horse is stolen. On the whole, it would
pay the bookmakers to suppress such advocacy.

HIS JOURNALISTIC EXPERIENCES.
KTE RECEIVES TWO MEDALS FOR BRAVERY.
SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION ABOUT OPALS.
A VALUABLE TESTIMONIAL IN FAVOUR OP
The WATERBURY WATCH.
Mr, Samuel Bennett Bailey, J.P., whose portrait appears below, is a native of Cornwall, England.
He is a son of Mr, William Bailey, chairman of the City of Sydney Improvement Board, and arrived
Australia wjth his parents when he was about four years old. Mr. Bailey, who is well-known as
Ihe Tourist ’—formerly of the Town and Country Journal, and more recently of the Sydney
Mail has had a large and varied experience of the colonies, having travelled extensively through
them. He has served with the firms of William Gardiner and Co., and S. Hoffnung and Co., Sydney,
and he resided for some time in Queensland, where he had the honour of being an officer in the Light
Infantry Corps at Toowoomba. Mr. Bailey has had some municipal experience. In 1881 he was
elected an alderman of the Borough of North Shore, where ho succeeded in inducing the
council to adopt the Nuisances Prevention Act. On his subsequent removal to Manly he was elected
an alderman of that important municipality by a substantial majority. He takes a great interest in
.I reemasonry, and has passed through the various offices in the Scottish Constitution, receiving the
degrees in succession up to the highest (Knight of the Red Cross). He has also held the position of
JuniOT Grand Warden in the Grand Lodge, being now a Past Junior Grand Warden in the United
Grand Lodge of New South Wales. Mr. Bailey, it may be mentioned, is a nephew of the late Mr.
Samuel Bennett, founder
of the Town and
Country Journal, to
the first number of which
paper, in 1870, he con-
tributed an article en-
titled “A Flying Visit
to Bourke.” He has
paid special attention to
the mining industry in
New South Wales, and
has reported upon nearly
all the mines in this
colony. He recently in-
spected
THE OPAL FIELDS AT
WHITE CLIFFS,
some sixty miles from
Wilcannia, and an in-
teresting report upon
them was contributed by
him to the Sydney Mail
of April 14 last. Mr.
Bailey says: “I was
shown some thick pieces
of pure opal of the most
beautiful harlequin and
various other tints. Some
of them resembled glo-
rious Australian sunsets
in miniature form, and
looked as if they had
been photographed in
colours from nature in
the very highest art of
perfect reproduction. The
opal fields are on one of
the largest station pro-
perties in the colony
(Moomba). The country
for miles around is
covered with water-worn
boulders of varying sizes,
and these, witli other
indications, such as sea-
shells, hundreds of which
I saw, some being opal-
ised, leave no doubt that
an inland salt water sea
or lake covered the whole
country at no very re-
mote date, . . . Opal
getting is very exciting.
Large quantities of opals
are found, but over 90
per cent, of them are of
no commercial value,
having no fire or life in
them; these are known
locally as potch opals.
The others range in value
from <£3 per ounce to
£5O, according to beauty
of colouring and thick-
ness and solidity of
body. . , . The opals
are chiefly sent to Mel-
bourne. Buyers come
from there periodically,
and frequently purchase
thousands of pounds’
worth at a visit.” It
having been remarked
that Sydney buyers did
not visit the opal fields,
Mr. Bailey, on his return
to Sydney, had an inter-
view with the well-known
firm of S. Hoffnung and
Co, Wholesale Jewellers,
etc., and he thinks that a
representative of that
enterprising house will probably ere long be found competing with the Melbourne buyers. It will be
noticed’that, in the portrait of Mr. Bailey, his breast is adorned with two medals. These he received
for gallantry. At the wreck of the Walter Hood off Jervis Bay, on April 29, 1870, Mr. Bailey and
Mr. John Harrison (now of the Richmond River) swam through the breakers no less than three times
in their
EFFORTS TO SAVE LIFE.
For his bravery, Mr. Bailey was awarded the silver medal and certificate of the Royal Humane Society
of England, and these were presented to him by Lord Belmore at the Anniversary Regatta of 1872 on
board the flagship. About the same time he received a medal from a number of Sydney merchants to
mark their appreciation of his conduct. Mr. Bailey informs us that, on an average, he travels about
20,000 miles annually in Australia. He is, therefore, a colonial notability, and, in these circumstances,
it is interesting to read

SNAKE POISON AND HUMAN POISON.
The bite of a rattlesnake is almost always fatal to
man. Yet this snake is never affected by the
injection of its own poison into its own blood,
neither when enraged it.bites itself nor when its
venom is injected by artificial means to test the
question. Speaking on the latter point Dr. S.
Weir Mitchell, an expert on snake poison, says,
“ I have over and over tried this experiment, but
in no case have I seen death result. Why should
this be ? ”
Dr. Mitchell further says ; “The many noxious
compounds man carries in his liver and gastric
glands (the stomach) are fatal if they enter the
blood in any large amount. There is scarcely an
organ in man’s body which is not a possible source
of poison to him. Small doses are constantly
passing into and out of his blood. The question
is whether he can get rid of it as fast as it ac-
cumulates.”
Alluding to death by rheumatism, gout, and
kidney disease, an eminent London physician says;
“Thus man is poisoned by the products of his own
body.”
Now let us cite a passage from a man’s experience
as related by himself. The time extends over a
period from March, 1888, to May, 1889, more than
a year. He says ;“ My head used to whirl around,
and I had frequent bouts of faintness and giddi-
ness ; and at such times I used to fall down, no
matter where I was. This would occur two or three
times a day. For three weeks I was confined to
my bed. I grew gradually weaker and weaker
and lost a deal of sleep. I felt more tired in the
morning than when I went to bed. After a while
I became nervous, and my legs trembled and shook
under me to such a degree that I feared to walk
out. I had great pain in my kidneys, and the
secretion which I voided from them was thick and
yellow as the yolk of an egg. Month after month
passed and I failed more and more, and could
hardly crawl about.
“I had a doctor attending me, but his medicines
did not benefit me. He said my liver and kidneys
were in a bad way, and that he never saw secretions
passed in such a state. After treating me six
months, he told me that medicine could do no
more for me and advised me to go to a hospital.
I went to Peterborough hospital, but got worse
while there. The hospital/doctors refused to tell
me what ailed me. Having spent two months
there, I got anxious and returned to my home,
utterly disheartened. I continued to send to the
hospital for medicines, which I took for three
months longer. I was now so emaciated that my
friends who came to see me said I would never
get well.
“In this condition I continued until May, 1889,
when one day an umbrella vendor called at my
house, and, seeing how ill I was, said his wife had
been cured of a serious illness by Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. He spoke so earnestly of it that
I determined to try it. After taking the Syrup
for ten days I felt in better spirits; ray food
agreed with me, and from that time I gained
strength daily. Persevering with it, I was soon
able to return to my work as healthy and strong
as ever. Since then I have been in the best of
health. You are at liberty to publish the above
facts, and I will gladly reply to any enquiries.
Yours truly (Signed), Read Welfare, Ramsey,
St. Mary’s, Hunts, February 18th, 1892.”
No brief comment can do justice to this remark-
able case. What the public needs to know and*to
remember is this: Mr. Welfare’s whole system
was poisoned by the products of a torpid and
inactive digestion. These had entered his blood,
as Dr. Mitchell describes. The nervous system
was disordered and half paralysed; hence the
faintness and falling fits. Rattlesnake poison
kills by paralysing the nerves which actuate the
lungs ; it kills by suffocation. Human poison,
arising from indigestion and dyspepsia, always
operates in the same direction, causing asthma
in its worst forms. It then attacks the
heart and kidneys, causing the state of things
Mr. Welfare mentions. Nothing more noxious,
or, in the end, surely fatal exists in any poisonous
reptile. And yet people trifle with the disease !
and doctors seem not to understand it.
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup cures by stimu-
-1 iting the kidneys, skin, and bowels, and toning
the gastric glands.
Who, then, is man’s most deadly enemy ? Care-
less and ignorant man himself. Use the remedy
then when the earliest symptoms appear.

Item for people with enlarged livers.
Taieb Bey, of Tunis, reputed to have one of the
most aggravated livers extant, was recently cured
by a French doctor, who pub the potentate naked
in a dark room and kept a single ray of violet-
coloured light directed at the diseased organ.
The treatment of disease by coloured light is
booming in consequence.
An advanced young woman writes as
follows : “ I shall never, never be satisfied until I
have been permitted to make love to a man accord-
ing to my own sweet will. Beginning at the
very first meeting, I want to enjoy the novel
sensation of telling a young man how I admire
him ; how his large, grey eyes fascinate me; how
I was struck by his graceful figure, his fine open
countenance, bronzed to!a soft brown and lighted
by such a calm and thoughtful smile. And then,
not with downcast eyes, but looking him straight
in his fine, honest face, I want to take his hand
and say : ‘ Mr. Thomas, lam none of your gush-
ing society girls, with no thoughts above marrons
glaces and pretty-faced actors, lam a young
woman of sense, and ripe, wholesome sentiment.
May I not have the pleasure of meeting you
again ?’ I should want to taste in small mouthfuls
of bliss that soft and gentle gradient which leads to
the telling of one’s love in English, with no hems or
haws, but straight to the point. Something like
this: ‘Dear Torn, how grandly handsome you
look to-night. Nay, my dear Tom, don’t blush,
you can’t help it; I have heard it said that your
father was an uncommonly handsome man ; it’s a
matter of inheritance, dear Tom ; pedigree, don’t
you know. My hair is naturally curly. Don’t be
afraid of disarranging my bangs. You may kiss
this hand of mine if you choose, Tom. The boys
all tell me it’s very white and pretty, but I haven’t
let any of them hold it. I’ve been waiting for
you, dearest Torn. Might I sit beside you? Don’t
be frightened, Tom ; there’s no rice-powder to rub
off on your coat. Thanks again. You really like
me, don’t you, Tom ? I love you with all a true
woman’s heart and soul. Can’t you see it in my
eyes ? Isn’t it visible on my very lips ?’ And so
on through the whole gamut, until at length, with
sweet coyness, his love burst the bonds of his col-
legiate bashfulness, and he whispered that he was
my own.”-

HERR RASSMUSSEIM, PH.D.
A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Herr Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as “ The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
mussen succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Alfaline Remedies, suffice it to say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in his celebrated work, “ The
Natural Doctor.”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific!,
conscientious and genuine herbalist —his last
ten years record being so wonderful that hii3
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor ; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
speeiallyforthe nerves,and another fortheblood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box coniaining the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Oorr. Mem. of the Academic Parisienne des
Inventeurs, France; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893; and in 1891 he issued his
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.
Dear Bulletin, —The reason why Wragge
didn’t predict the ’93 flood is because he wasn’t in
Brisbane. He never predicted the greatest cyclone
( >n record. Wragge is a white man.—Yours, Tom
Einney. [This is plump ; but The Bulletin has
tn ancient memory of trembling at some 'cyclone
which ungallantly refused to come when it was
;sailed by C. Wragge from the vasty deep.—Ed. B.]
Montgomery, the convict, lately hanged,
wished to make a statement on the scaffold, bub
was dissuaded from doing this by his “spiritual
adviser.” Much speculation has been indulged in
as to what he would have said. The Bulletin is
in a position tq supply the desired information.
The agent of the celebrated whisky-manufacturing
firm of Messrs. ——, and Co. happened to be in
Sydney at the time and he had promised to hand
over to the relatives of the condemned ,£lOO if he
would say from the scaffold in calm, clear, unmis-
takeable tones immediately previous to the inevit-
able sickenin’ thud, “Had I stuck to ——’s whisky
I would never have been here.”
the meeting of Agents-GeneraUat London anent
Hareourt’s Death Duties Bill, referred to the
English tea-impost of 1775, and the result in the
emeute at Boston harbour. “ The others present,”
the cable adds, “strongly deprecated the com-
parison.” Our oath, yes! we can picture the horror-
stricken countenance of the usually rosy-cheeked
Gillies when he heard the seditious remark.
Julian Thomas was once holding forth in his pre-
sence on the “Sacred right of Revolution.”
“Yes, sir!” yelled Duncan, “and we have still,
thank God, the sacred right of hanging !”
The following —verbatim from a private
letter received in Sydney by last African mail—is
in answer to a question pub by a Bulletin cor-
respondent in his letter to one of the pioneers of
the British S. African Chartered Co. It speaks
for itself :
Should any of your newspapers want to know whether
the prisoners taken during the late Matabele war were
deliberately shot or not, just tell him yes. The poor
devils were terribly cut about, and, after having their
wounds dressed, were found too troublesome to cart along
with us, so officers ordered them to be shot. It was dis-
graceful.
The writer of the letter was one of the Co.’s chosen
advance-guard from the Very inception of the then,
comparatively, peaceful expedition ; and when the
“ war” started he was placed in charge of one of
the Maxims.
Dear Bulletin, —In your issue of June 2,
you quote (without comment) a par. from London
Referee on the eternal woman question. In it
the writer, after complaining that women are not
fair in their dealings with each other, makes this
truly astounding statement: “Men are just to
each Other in all matters, save, perhaps, where a
woman is concerned.” Could you kindly inform
me who runs the London Referee now ? I ask
because I am curious to know the name of the
biggest ass in all the world. “ Men are just to
each other in all matters !!!” Then men never
rob, or burgle, or forge cheques, or embezzle, or
run bogus banks and Liberator Building societies,
or perjure themselves, or lie, or misrepresent each
other, or run unjust wars, or embezzle some
nigger’s territory. Also, there is no shadow of
injustice about the Mount Rennie episode, or the
National Ass, or the Pastoralists’ Union, or the
Employers’ Association, or the Freetrade party,
or the Matabele war, or Irish coercion, or the
system of private property in land, or about.Tabez
Balfour, or Abigail’s bank, or the Victorian land-
boom, or the Matthew Davies institutions, or the
Munro clan’s overdraft at the Federal, or about
the House of Lords, or the churches, or the par-
sons, or about anything else. Why doesn’t some-
body capture that Referee editor and shove him
into 36 lunatic asylums—no smaller number of
asylums could hold a maniac of his awful dimen-
sions.—Yours, &0., Titus Salt.
A bon mot is something you always think
of after it’s too late to say it.
Woman always needs a protector. If she
is young it will be a lover; if she is old, a priest.”

and opened in his presence.
No. 8 Competition closed with 1104 guesses, hailing
from all parts of ths colonies. Amount for division (sub-
ject to 10 per cent, deduction), £27 12s. The required
word was INIQUITOUS, and was named by the following;
G. A. Allerton, St. John’s Road, Glebe ; Duncan Cameron,

was—'* Bad as was the crime of Mr. M’Kay’s murder by
the Barraba assassins, their subsequent destruction of the
beautiful and faithful steeds has been characterised by
those acquainted with the facts as an even more iniquitous
piece of brutality.” The most numerous guesses were—
atrocious, odious, execrable, deliberate, and inhuman.
The remainder were very varied. One competitor thought
“mongrel” a good word; another “gibbosity.” Two
enclosures bore no signature or address. Several informal,
owing to deficiency in stamps for exchange.

Fearing the progressive land-tax, Henry
Dutton, owner of the Anlaby estate, which
squeezes the life-blood out of Kapunda (S. A.), has
offered between 50,000 and 60,000 acres of freehold
land to Government at £2 an acre, and agrees to
take 4 per cent, stock in payment. Other mono-
polists of good country near Adelaide are expected
to show themselves equally amenable to reason
and the Democratic majority.
The latest sensational alleged poisoning-
case makes one think hard. It is now insinuated
that the death of the prisoner’s husband was due,
like the mysterious illness of the man who seems to
have so narrowly escaped, to poison, and it is
moreover hinted that several of the prisoner’s
children also died under suspicious circumstances.
If it is possible for clumsy arsenic-poisoners to
have a long run, how many skilful undetected
murderers may be amidst the community ?
“The Art of Living in Australia.” A
chapter has evidently been left out of this valuable
book, which is full of good advice and precious
hints. In these times of depression the Govern-
ment has given the example of economy—salaries
cut down, hands cut off, and so on. In private
life people have followed suit, and as smoking fine
cigars is a luxury (when you don’t know the differ-
ence between a stincador and a Havana) a bib of
advice on the choice of a cigar would have been
welcome. However, if you adopt Frossard’s
Swiss you _ will make no mistake, but a serious
economy will result as they cost a trifle over a
penny apiece.
Moral:
Oh 1_ how noble and how great is the art
To live on little with a happy heart 1
And to get a decent penny-smoke.
“ Perhaps the most unique and valuable
testimonial ever given, is that which the Empress
of Germany has just sent to the proprietors of
Mellin’s Food, in which she declares that their
food has been used with the best results by the
young princes, sons of their Imperial Majesties
the Emperor and Empress. As the eldest of their
seven sons was a full-blown officer at ten, Mellin’s
Food will doubtleas soon be used in every German
household. We hear, by the way, that Miss Maud
Holmes, Major Knox Holmes’s grand-daughter,
the champion five-year-old cyclist of the world,
was brought up entirely on Mellin’s Food, to the
efficacy of which her grandfather ascribes much of
her phenomenal strength.”
Ibis now strongly denied that Bertrand
ever kept a diary of the kind imputed (».c., one in
which a number of his lady-patients were com-
promised). The present writer was told by the
late Detective Elliott that he (Elliott) had seen
the diary, of which he gave many particulars;
and several other officials have also stated that
they were personally aware of the the
diary in question. If it is true that there ffbver
was any such diary, then it is plain that Ber-
trand’s uniquely long detention in gaol has been,
in some respects, due to the existence of a rumour
as ill-founded as were many of those current about
the Mt. Rennie prisoners before their execution.
Mr. P. J. Maroney exhibits at the Strand
Arcade, Sydney, a collection of paintings repre-
senting the bushranging era in Australia. The
horses and larger portraits are particularly well
done; the landscapes not so well. Anyone
acquainted with the scenes and characters pour-
trayed cannot but thrill to such a vivid reproduc-
tion of one of the most striking phases in our
history. The catalogue faintly outlines the high
heroism frequently displayed by both bushrangers
and police; and even town-bred pulses beat
faster in realising the pluck and daring bred in
the wilds of the bush. The pictures are clever
and most interesting, and do Mr. Maroney great
credit.

A PAGE FORM LIFE
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They came to the mine one sweltering day.
They were mates, Jack Simmonds and “Smiler **
Grey.
They worked on the same shifts day or night—
If you hammered one you’d the other to fight;
And they both got struck on old Tanner’s lass.
And she fancied Jack. And it came to pass—>
We were three in the cage—Self, Simmonds,
and Gray.
We were giving the signal to “ haul away,”
The drills were packed and the fuses lit,
When Simmonds muttered — “ Mates, wait a
bit 1
Don’t start her yet. There’s a fuse gone out.”
And he slipped away from our warning shout.
He had gone to the drive 1 ’Twas a reckless
thing.
When—O God ! —the cage gave an upward
spring !
They misread the signal to hold her back !
We were rushing up thro’ the darkness black 1
There might yet be time if he stopped her
quick—
“ Damn the fools !” yelled Gray : “ Jack !—the
knocker-line—slick !”
But he let us go and made no reply—
Ere the cage got down ’twould be time to die,
For the shortest fuse was too near its mark 1
Then his voice came up like a ghost’s thro’ the
dark,
“ Too late—good-bye—it’s one life or three—
Be good to her, Gray, for the sake of me !”

The station-masters on the Melb. suburban
railways often plant in flowers, &c., the name of
the station in the ground adjacent to the platform.
The man of East Richmond, following in the steps
of the Premier who invited Mr. and Mrs. York to
Victoria, has also planted a Crown and V.R.
But neither the Crown nor the initials will grow
on the East Richmond soil, and the station-master
cannot sleep at night in consequence.
Dear Bulletin, —“Veritas” is wrong*
Ben Boyd, on the last cruise of the Wanderer, did
intend to bring back a cargo of blackbirds from
the Solomons. He originally meant to call at
Anouda (Cherry Island) and get a load. He said
that he had received a letter from a white man
there who promised to get him “30 or 40 intelli-
gent young people of both sexes, well-fitted for
domestic service.” Possibly he changed his mind
and thought he could grab all the niggers he
wanted at the Solomons without the aid of a
middleman. But he got none—they got him
instead. -Liver-pad.

Editor Bulletin. — “J.R.’s” theory that
“amuck ” is of Arabic, and not Malay, origin is
ingenious, but it won’t hold water. Ahmag in
Arabic does not mean “ mad drunk,” but “fool-
ish,” “ silly.” If “ amuck ” were an Arabic word
taken over into Malay, it would be written as in
Arabic, the Malays using Arabic letters. But
“ amuck ” is, in Malay, written amug, and not in
the form of ahmag. Some Sepoys may use the
word “ amuck,” but in Hindostani ahmag only
carries its ordinary Arabic meaning. The word is
certainly no recent importation into Malay, as the
Portuguese found it there in 1511, and wrote it
“ amuco.” It also belongs to Javanese. —J.M.B,
In his tilfc with Rev. Buchanan, Wallace
Nelson, the Brisbane lecturer, supplied the follow-
ing mosaic of many people’s good things, entitled
“ A Freethinker’s Creed ” ;
“I believe in man, the maker and destroyer of all the
gods and devils, who was before them, and shall be when
they have passed away.
“ I believe that there is no religion higher than virtue.
Goodness without God is better than God without good-
ness.
“I believe that the rational end of human life is joy,
and that the only pathway to joy is justice. When men
know the right and love the right, and do the right, then
only will true happiness d well on earth.
“I believe that honest labour, whether of mind or musole,
is the only prayer Nature ever answers. Petition the
earth with a spade, and it will answer with a harvest.
“I believe in the religion of the body, the religion of
physical exercise, well-ventilated houses, and full cup-
boards. The higher spiritual life has its roots in material
conditions ; take care of the body, and the soul will take
care of itself.
“ I believe that it is the right and the duty of every
man to think for himself, and to express the results of his
thinking. The thought that is sincere may be mistaken,
but it cannot be sinful. Free discussion is the test of
truth, and whoever opposes it is the enemy of mankind.
“ I believe in the religion of laughs and smiles, th«
religion which encircles the life of man with the rainbow
of joy. Ido not believe that it makes God happy to see
men miserable. Theologians talk of the joy of duty. 1
believe in the duty of joy. The smile of a serene and
happy man helps to make the whole earth glad.
“ 1 believe that one world is enough at a time, parti-
cularly when you are not sure of any other. The wise
man does not crave for a non-natural life beyond death ;
he strives rather to live worthily the life that now is. A
heaven in the hand is worth two in the bush.
“ I believe in the coming of the kingdom of man, when
men and women shall regard the Universe as the only
temple, Humanity as the only god, Morality as the only
religion, and the living of a pure, upright and useful life
as the only piety worthy of the homage and respect of
mankind.”

Dear Bulletin, —Can a horse buck off the
saddle without the girth being lossed? Some
horses, especially young ones, can—l have seen it.
The horse that does it must have a very low
wither, thin, sloping shoulders, and small arm
bones. There is a knack, which few horses learn,
in pressing the elbow joints into the chest. If a
horse of the right shape once learns the trick,
nothing but a surcingle can euchre him.—J.R.

The Road to Wyoming.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Upon the road to Wyoming
The tall ferns rustled in the wood
When I rode forth to gain a thing
That was to me life’s only good—
Oh, love so lightly understood,
Oh, last gleam of a golden wing !
I may not ride now, though I would,
Upon the road to Wyoming.
The cool, deep stillness after rain,
The fragrant earth, the dripping trees,
The road still winding to attain
The far-off mountains’ mysteries;
The dappled shade the boughs would fling—
My dream of joy endeared Jail these
Upon the road to Wyoming.
Till, all the long miles ridden through,
I saw her standing by the fence
To greet me with a shyness new,
A heavenly coldness of pretence ;
She knew the gift I came to bring,
She knew I loved her, soul and sense,
Upon the road to Wyoming.
She stood between the day and night.
Between red sunset and pale moon,
Her head drooped on one shoulder white
As droops a lily in the noon ;
Her voice was as the breath of spring,
Her beauty wrapped me in a swoon
Upon the road to Wyoming.
I leapt from off my horse in haste
(The moon grew bright, the day waxed pale)
The world without was but a waste —
I feared to let her power prevail,
Yet spoke, on reason’s backward swing—
I kissed her ; by the paddock rail,
Upon the road to Wyoming !
Oh, unforgotten moment, won
From out the clutch of ruthless Fate 1
I clasped her close, my only one,
The mistress of my love and hate,
My heart that gold head pillowing—
Ah me, ah me, we lingered late
Upon the road to Wyoming.
I rode away before the morn,
I rode to win her wealth and fame.
Her love should never turn to scorn.
Her pride should be to bear my name—
For I would conquer Life and bring
All gifts to feed that altar flame
Upon the road to Wyoming.
I whispered, close to her pale mouth,
One year should see me claim my bride—
Then east and west and north and south
I fought the cold, fierce ocean-tide,
One gold tress, twisted in a ring,
Was all my token of the ride
Upon the road to Wyoming. i
For her X fought, for her I won,
I came when summer’s golden haze
Lay on this land that loves the sun,
The land of pastoral, peaceful ways,
Straight as an arrow from the string
I passed along the old, old ways
Upon the road to Wyoming. . s
I drew so near our meeting-place
I dreamt I kissed her lips again,
Then, ah ! —I saw her living face,
Her dark eyes washed with purple stain.
Her shape, her light, swift footsteps’ swing,
Her loosened tresses’ golden grace,
Upon the road to Wyoming.
Yet, oh just gods! ev’n more than this
I saw, and better were she dead 1
A stranger came that face to kiss,
And laughed and stroked that sunlit head —
Ey n now I feel the serpent sting
That turned the azure sky blood-red
Upon the road to Wyoming !
I held my hand, I did not slay.
Oh woman ! you were pale with fear.
I was the fool—you cried that day—
I left you for a whole long year !
As if you were a flower to fling
Aside for months !—I had faint cheer
Upon the road to Wyoming.
For so you spoke when he was gone
And I rode up and faced you there;
Ah, well, poor reed that I leaned on,
You have some sorrow for your share!
I think your guardian saint took wing
When you grew false through your despair
Upon the road to Wyoming.
Ah, better you had died, in truth,
And I, I dreamed of death that hour 1
But in a flash my stricken youth,
My slain love, faded like a flower;
I saw what gifts the years might bring,
Great truths should crush that falsehood’s
power,
Upon the road to Wyoming.
So forward 1 to outlive the lie
Far from your false white arms and breast,
Though I shall carry till I die
The fierce regret that cannot rest;
Though love has grown a worthless thing,
I see you always, golden-tressed,
Upon the road to Wyoming.
I see you always, though again
I shall not clasp your perjured band ;
Though love survive, betwixt us twain
For evermore the fierce gods stand !
Farewell! for myriad voices sing
From shore to shore, though none remain
Upon the road to Wyoming.
Farewell! farewell! had you been true,
Ev’n life had been not much to miss;
But now—a few more years lived through
And we forget the pang of this.
Alas ! I think, my flower of spring,
My dying lips will feel your kiss
Upon the road to Wyoming.

The men charged with stealing from Q.
M.L.A. Leahy and Stephens during the recent
Ministerial visit to Thargomindah were committed
for trial at Toowoomba District Court, 500 miles
away; though a District Court sits at Cunnamulla,
close by ; and the Supreme Court at Roma. This
is to suit the convenience of the prosecutors,
Toowoomba being within easy reach of Brisbane;
while it will probably prevent the witnesses for
the defence from appearing. One is not a number
for nothing.
Another effort in the direction of the

contain every word in the English and American

every trade and profession upon this earth, it
comes so near to doing so that only the most
laborious critic can find out the difference. It
is beautifully printed, contains many thou-
sands of excellent illustrations, and as an
authority upon pronunciation is absolutely
unrivalled. Also, in addition to all this, the
authors have wandered into many bye-ways of
knowledge and supply a vast fund of curious
information of all descriptions. The volume em-
bodies a pronouncing gazetteer, an encyclopaedia
of biography, geography, Scripture names, Greek
and Latin terms, a brief history of the old
Teutonic languages on which the English is based,
and many other matters. In short, Webster’s is
a magnificent compendium of British knowledge,

Lord Henry 1 elham Clinton Hope, brother
and heir-presumptive to the poor little Duke of
Newcastle, filed his schedule the other day.
Liabilities, ,£400,000; and assets, £l9o,ooo—tall
figures for a younger son, and accounted for by
the fact that his mother came of a rich banking
clan which has made many deplorable efforts to
keep the main line of Pelham Clintons from going
to hopeless ruin. This precious Lord Henry is
evidently doomed to die in the backroom of a
cheap lodging-house, like his ducal progenitor. If
he becomes a duke himself (as is highly probable,
since his elder brother is a puny, deformed
invalid, without any children), Henry will derive
no cash benefit from his hereditary peerage. His
prospects will be pawned up to the hilt, and
the representative person will eke out a
hole-and-corner existence as aforesaid. That
may be taken as granted. Yet, somehow
or other, the duke coming after him will
have more riches to play with unless he, in his
turn, has fooled away his inheritance before it
falls due. Nothing can prevent an untitled family,
however opulent at the outset, from working down
into the criminal classes if it have “ Newcastle ”
tendencies in the blood, but the British Gonstitu-
tion and British sassiety conspire to prevent
aristocratic vices from achieving their natural
results. Had these Pelham Clintons been ex-
changed by their wet nurses for plebeian babi s,
the majority of them would have rushed headlong
to prison, nerhaps to the gallows. But as their
nurses did'not mix ’em up, the Clintons provide
sport for tuft-hunters and furnish the State with
one of its grand old pillars, and their ancient
family motto is “ Loyalty knows no shame.”

Dear Bulletin, —About English rule in
India. You want to know whether Editor Brient
or Editor Ward is right. They are both wrong,
as usual. They know nothing about it. I am a
Mahratta Braham, and I hate the English as
much as any man can. When my caste-fellow,
Nana Rao Dundhu Pant, fooled Wheeler and cut
off the English almost to a man at Cawnpore my
father hoped that the terrible Mahratta horsemen
would once more overrun the plains of Hindustan,
The Nana, whom you English call Nana Sahib,
was beaten, and his men dispersed by Have-
lock. Then we hoped that the old Bad-
shah, the last of the house of Taimur
Lane, would beat the English before Delhi,
Had he done so, Scindia, the great Mahratta chief,
could have taken his city and his treasure and
put out his eyes, as the first Scindia put out those
of Alain Shah. Then the Mahratta Brahman
would have been supreme, and could have lorded
it over the unclean Muslim, killer of the holy
*> ulls - , We bate the English because they will not
let us do this, but compel us to live in outward
peace with our enemies and old-time perse-
cutors. Their rule has been good for the people in
many ways. They are just, and respect our laws,
and the raiat can till his land in peace ; but their
rule is a system, and though their taxes are not
heavy, no man can escape them. As for Editor
Ward’s talk about foreign and native tyrannies,
India has never, for 1000 years, been free from
foreign tyranny. Outside a very small district of
the Ooucun I am a foreigner, and should be a
“foreign tyrant,” if I could. The Maharaja
Scindia is a foreigner in his own State of Gwaliar.
So is the Nizam of Hyderabad in his. He is the
descendant of a Kipjak Tartar. The cowardly
Khayast, of Bengal, who talks about “Indian
Nationality,” knows, if he is not a fool, that the
only thing that prevents him from being stripped
and enslaved is the presence of the English power,
— Peeshad Narain.

Renders valuable assistance in Wasting Fever.
Beneficial as a diet in severe eases of Typhoid.
Invaluable in Cholera Infantum,
Professor Sidney Ringer, of the University College,

Extract from Prof. Ziemssen’s “Cyclopaedia of

ON CHOLERA INFANTUM.—YoI. VII.
“Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the
principal method of treatment for Sporadic
Cholera, and particularly Cholera Infantum.
When the mother’s milk is insufficient, Nestle’s
Food is alone to be recommended.”—Pro. Wm. O.
Ledbe.
On TREATMENT of RACHITIS.—YoI. XVI.
“ In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding
stands foremost among the causes of those gastro-
intestinal disorders which are so dangerous in
infant life. I recommend Nestle’s Infant Food
from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.’’ —Prof. Senator.
On SCROFULOSTS.—YoI. XVI.
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.”—Prof.
Birch-Hirschfeld.

The Tragedy.
“ La Dame aux Camillas ”
I think that was the play;
The house was packed from pit to dome
With the gallant and the gay.
Who had come to see the tragedy.
And while the hours away.
There was the ruined spendthrift.
And beauty in her prime ;
There was the grave historian,
And there the man of rhyme,
And the surly critic, front to front,
To see the play of crime.
And there was pompous Ignorance,
And Vice in flowers and lace;
Sir Croesus and Sir Pandarus—
And the music played apace.
But of all that crowd I only saw
A single, single face.
That of a girl whom I had known
In the summers long ago.
When her breath was like the new-mown hay,
Or the sweetest flowers that grow —
When her heart was light, and her soul was white
As the winter’s driven snow.
’Twas in our own New England
She breathed the morning air ;
’Twas the sunshine of New England
That blended with her hair;
And Modesty and Purity
Walked with her everywhere.
The years went by, and the maiden grew
Like a hairbell in the glade ;
The chestnut shadows crept in her eyes—
Sweet eyes that were not afraid
To look to heaven at morn or even,
Or any time she prayed.
She was the light of the cottage then ;
She was the golden sun
Of her grandsire’s life—the poor old man
Whose toil was nearly done.
He watched her in the clover-patch,
And among the tasseled corn,
And in the lawns where apple-blooms
Were falling night and morn ;
And he saw the holy thoughts that grew
Within her eyes like dawn.
She walked with him to the village church,
And his eyes would fill with pride
To see her walk with the man she loved—
To see them side by side.
Sweet Heaven ! she were an angel now
If she had only died !
If she had only died ! Alas,
How keen must be the woe
That makes it better one should lie
Where the sunshine cannot go,
Than to live in this pleasant, sunny world,
Where the flowers of summer blow !
Would she had wed some country boor
Before the luckless day
When her cousin came to that simple home—
Her cousin, Clarence Maye,
With his city airs and handsome eyes
To lead her soul astray !
God dropped a pearl in his path of life,
The heart of that sinless child,
And he threw it away with a cruel laugh—
He murdered while he smiled !
Oh, but his words were soft as dew,
And his voice was frank and mild.
One night they left the cottage—
One night in the mist and rain ;
And the old man never saw his pet
Nor Clarence Maye again ;
Never saw his pet in the clover-patch,
In the meadow, nor the lane.
And day by day he looked for her,
This pitiful old man ;
At last he died, and they buried him
Where the silver waters ran.
Many a time, like milk-white birds,
The daisies flew away,
But we never heard of her who fled
In the night with Clarence Maye—
Never knew if she were alive or dead,
Till I met her at the play.
And there she sat with her great brown eyes—
They wore a troubled look ;
And I read the history of her life
As it were an open book ;
And saw her Soul, like a slimy thing,
In the bottom of a brook.
There she sat in her rustling silk,
With diamonds on her wrist.
And on her brow a gleaming thread
Of pearl and amethyst.
“ A cheat, a gilded grief 1” I said,
And my eyes were filled with mist.
I could not see the players play ;
I heard the music moan—
It moaned a dismal autumn wind,
That dies in the woods alone ;
And when it stopped I heard it still,
The mournful monotone.
What if the Count were true or false?
I did not care, not I;
What if Camille for Armand died ?
I did not see her die.
There sat a woman opposite
With piteous lip and eye.
The great green curtain fell on all—
On laugh, and wine, and woe—
Just as death some day will fall
’Twixt us and life, I know.
The play was done —the bitter play—
And the people turned to go.
And did they see the Tragedy ’
They saw the painted scene;
They saw Armand, the jealous fool,
And the sick Parisian queen ;
But they did not see the tragedy—
The one I saw, I mean.
They did not see that cold-cut face,
That furtive look of care;
Or seeing her jewels, only said :
“The lady’s rich and fair.”
But I tell you, ’twas the Play of Life,
And that woman played Despair !

A Memory of North Queensland.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The blacks had played up old Harry with the
cattle across the river. There had been a bit of a
fresh, and they had taken full advantage thereof.
When we gob across we found the cattle like
hunted devils, cattle-spears—roughly scraped and
fire-pointed saplings—all over the country, and
two or three big camps with ovens where they had
been holding high carnival. They had all
departed when we arrived, leaving nothing but
bullocks’ bones and a trail behind, so Collins and
I and two black boys started after them to read
them the usual lesson, leaving the others to put
the cattle a little shipshape.
One of the boys, Frank, was a runaway trooper;
the other, Sambo, a smart young fellow belong-
ing to the district, had been caught when a lad of
fourteen, and had been on the station with the
whites some four years. He knew the country
well where the blacks were making for, and as he
had not the slightest reluctance to go after them
even if they turned out to be his kinsfolk, I took
him with us.
It was wearisome tracking. The main trail
split and split and split again until at last we
found ourselves following up simply the faint
traces of some gins. However, we knew they were
bbund to come together in camp again, so if we
only stuck to one track it would be all right.
About noon we came to their first camp, which
they had only left that morning ; evidently they
were full of meat and lazy ; also, they had been
laden with a good supply, for two ovens had been
made.
The trail was now pretty warm, and towards
the end of the afternoon we heard the blacks
ahead of us in a thick gidya and brigalow scrub
that grew at the foot of a red conglomerate wall —•
all poor, unoccupied country. We waited patiently
to let them gather to the camp, and then, having
located it by the smokes, not to mention
the smell, we spread out and began to
advance. We should have surprised them
nicely, but one old wretch of a gin was crawling
in late and Collins nearly rode over her. She
kicked up enough hullabaloo for twenty, so we
had nothing for it but to rush the camp as quickly
as we could. Most of them got away amongst
the rocks, and clambered up the face of the wall
where we could only follow on foot; however,
they left nearly all their weapons behind for us to
make a bonfire of. I was standing in the deserted
camp with Collins, using strong language about
the old gin aforesaid, when he suddenly said,
“ Good Lord ! look at that old fellow.”
On the top of the wall, close to the edge, an
old, white-headed blackfellow was walking with
his hands stretched out in a curiously helpless
fashion. The boys looked too, and Frank picked
up his rifle, but I called out to him not to fire, for
the old fellow was evidently blind—l could see by
the way he walked. Even as I spoke he made a
false step, and pitched headlong down amongst
the rocks below, some forty feet. Frank and
Sambo went over to look at him, and when they
came back reported him dead, and, as I thought,
blind.
Blacks always want to jabber late after a dis*
persing-match, so, when we camped that night,
we told the boys to make a fire for themselves a
little way off, in order that we might not be dis-
turbed. I had dropped off into a nice sleep, when
I was awakened by uproarious laughter from the
boys’ camp. In very bad humour I called out to
them to “ shut up and not make such an infernal
row.”
To my surprise Frank got up and came over,
still on the broad grin.
“My word, Marmie !” (as I have said, he was
an old policeman) “what you think?” he said,
between his chuckles. “ Sambo, he bin just re-
member. That one old fellow, tumble down
along-a wall ” —here he went off into a shriek—
“ That fellow , father helonga him /”
And he doubled up with laughter to which
Sambo responded with shouts of merriment.
BINGHL.
Stifle :—“ Can the buckjumper get off the
saddle without the girths being undone? Yes.
When you buckle him he will blow himself out
half-a-dozen strap-holes. Then he nips up, and.
the saddle turns round. Lying on the ground, he
can easily worry it over his head and feet.”
In “Ghosts of a Gallows,” which appeared
in a recent Bulletin, this passage occurred :
. . . Weachuroh was again put on his trial for
attempted murder. The benevolent and eloquent Ireland
undertook his defence and secured an acquittal. In
gratitude Weachuroh indited a poem (?) to his able and
generous advocate. This metrical effort was far less
excusable than his attempt to murder, but no action was
taken to avenge the violated muse.
The verses were written on a tract from which
The Bulletin now transcribes them as a contri-
bution to the reminiscences of the Victorian
Bar: —
Thou noble, brave, warm-hearted man
To sell A client was nere thy plan,
But do for them the best thou can,
Thou brave, large-hearted Ireland.
The greatest warrior of the law
That ever the Australian colonies saw.
Poor man from elegal troubles to draw
Is the brave, stout-hearted Ireland.
He took my enemies by the nose
And thurapt them well by verbal blows
Till they could scarcely stand upon their toes
Did that brave, warm-hearted Ireland.
He’s an aged son of the emerald isle.
As keen as any new-cut file,
He makes the gravest judges smile.
That bold, clear-headed Ireland.
God bless him for the good he’s done
And for the victory he has won
In trouncing my enemies, everyone.
The brave Queen’s councillor, Ireland.
So all who may feel themselves distrest
In points of law will do the best
To get assistance for the test
Which will be found in Mr. Ireland.
He leaves no client in the lurch.
See how he sticks to poor Weachuroh,
Who cannot pray for or thank too much
That great, old Councillor Ireland.
All blessings on his hoary head,
Which is the prayer Weachuroh has said.
Ah, and the noble jewery led
By that old warrior Ireland.
The law is at his finger ends.
In his ease, where life or death depends,
A Judge seldom to the gallows sends
A case defended by old Ireland.
A nobbier Jewery oould not be found
Within all Melbourne ile be bound
To give A verdict more true and sound
For Weachuroh adrest by Ireland.
And now all blessings on them all.
And their relations great or small;
May trouble never on them fall
Is Weachuroh'* prayer for them and Ireland.
The barrister died shortly after receiving this
blow, and the bard was ultimately hanged.
The First Kanakas.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The men who introduced the first Kanakas to
Australia will go down to posterity arm in arm
with the calamitous persons who introduced the
Bathurst burr, the sida retusa, and the fugacious
rabbit. While some one is preparing a biography
of the burr, retusa, and rabbit scientists, it may
be well to settle the Kanaka pioneer on a solid
historical basis. A period of 48 years has passed
since Benjamin Boyd landed his 64 Kanakas from
the Portenic, on September 24, 1846. These blacks
came from Lifa, Weear, Rotumah, and De Peys-
tris Islands. Boyd was killed in 1851 by the
natives of Guadalcanar, and his skull was the
only portion of his anatomy ever recovered. To
Robert Towns belongs the peculiar honour of intro-
ducing the first Kanakas to Queensland. His agree-
ment with the Government and his instructions to
Capt. Grueber, of the Don Juan, and to Ross
Luin, the agent, are interesting documents. The
agreement is dated at Sydney, May 30th, 1863,
and reads as follows :
1. Witnesseth,—l, Robert Towns, hereby engage and
undertake to pay as wages to any able adult native that
may be hired for my service, at and after the rate of 10s.
per month, in such trade as he may prefer at the end of
his agreement, and to return him to his home within
12 months, should he require such.
2. I also agree to find the natives huts, or houses, or
tents, until huts can be put up, and to supply them with
good and sufficient food, such as they are accustomed to
(they were all cannibals!), and to provide them with
cooking utensils, and in every way watch over and protect
them during the period of their servitude.
3. The labour those natives will be required to perform
will be chiefly Held labour of a light and easy description,
such as cleaning and picking cotton when in season, and
any other work they may be called upon to perform.
Witness ray hand this 30th day of May, 1863.
R. Towns.
In his letter of instructions to Ross Luin, dated
May 29th, Towns writes ;
To Mr. Ross Linn.
Sir,—Referring to our verbal agreement for your pre-
sent employment on the intended expedition of the Don
Juan, after a number of natives to be employed on my
cotton-fields in Queensland, I now give you my written
instructions for your guidance, and as I understand you
are no scholar. Captain Grueber will read them for you,
and explain what is required of you. First, you will pro-
ceed to call at such islands as you are known to the
natives, and then explain to them what your object is,
namely, to engage for me from 50 to 100 natives, all male,
on the present voyage, until they are better known in the
district and colony.
I will prefer young lads, from 15 to 18, in preference to
older men, as the bulk, but you must have some old
hands among the lot to induce the young ones to enlist.
In engaging or persuading these people, you must tell
them exactly what they have to do, that is, their chief
work will be in the cotton-fields, and that they will hare
good huts to live in, a kind master to protect, and
that you will take them back within 12 months, perhaps
in six, and that you will be on the station to explain and
interpret for them, and that they will be paid in goods at
the rate of 10s. per month (over and above their rations)
for the able men, and the others according to their worth
and value.
I presume you will call at Lifu or Wear (Weear) first,
and then to Sandwich. I leave this for you and Capt.
Grueber to arrange ; and while I am on this I must here
remind you that while you are on board the ship you are
to act and do the duty in every way as second mate, for
which service you have signed the articles of the vessel,
and in which capacity you will be paid at and after the
rate of £5 per month, which pay will be continued you
on the station so long as you remain or other arrange-
ments are made. In conclusion I must remind you of my
earnest desire that the natives are treated with the
greatest kindness, and on no account allow them to be ill-
used by the crew or any person on board; If such is
offered to them, it is your duty to report the same to the
oaptain. I will be satisfied with 50 young men and bovs
if you can get them, but will be better pleased with 70 if
the vessel can bring so many comfortably, but on no
account crowd them or delay the vessel for the purpose
You must endeavour all you can to keep the natives
in good humour and friendly and on good terms with
each other. On no account allow them to quarrel or have
any national disputes on board, keep all such quarrelling
from them, if you find such unfortunately to take place
at once separate them and put up bulkheads between
them.
Take care none of the old beach-combers—European
sailors—smuggle themselves on board with the natives.
You had better call at Leipo before Hayes gets there
and leave before he may arrive (!) I think 1 have now
said all I hare to mention, and hope you may have a
successful voyage.”—R. Towns.
In a long letter of instructions to.Oapt. Grueber
of the Don Juan, Towns says :
“ I have put on board two suits of shirts and trousers
for 100 natives. ... I will engage to provide them
regular rations of rice, meal, pumpkins, potatoes and
yams (if they will grow), and return them in 12 months
very likely in six. ... If you find it difficult to pro-
cure natives through Mr. Ross Luin, you better run over
to Earomanga to Mr. Henry’s station and he may be able
to assist you. . . . You must be a little easy with Mr.
Ross Luin, but if he fails to give you satisfaction, go to
Mr. Henry at Earomanga, or Mr. Underwood at Amataw
and they will put a man on."
And so the Don Juan departed and duly returned
with the Polynesian cannibals for the Townsvale
plantation on the Logan River. At the present
time in Queensland there are 7100 male and 700
female Kanakas, 8200 Chinese, and 2000 Japs
Javanese, and Cingalese. There is no record of
the time-expired Kanakas who are scattered all
over the colony, nor of those who have gone south
to the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence Rivers.
Next to come will be a detachment of mop-headed
Papuans from New Guinea, and in about 50 years
hence Jupiter and Juno can celebrate their golden
wedding in Queensland and be attended, as at the
first nuptials, by “all the gods, all specimens of
mankind, and all the animal creation,”
Boyd landed in “Wanderer’s Bay,” where he
was first speared and then cut down with a green-
stone axe. The oaptain of the Observer pur-
chased his skull, for 20 tomahawks, on Feb. 10th
1855. During the debate in the N.S.W. Legist
lative Council, on a search party to be sent to
Guadalcanar, in 1854, Dr. Douglass, M.L.C.,
suggested that the vessel sent to look for Boyd
should call at the Percy Islands and see if any of
Strange, the botanist’s, party were still alive.
Strange and five others landed on the island
and the only two who escaped were Walter Hill,
the first Curator of the Queensland Botanic
Gardens, and a myall named “Deliappee.” The
others were killed by the blacks.

“The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVENG.
With Prefatory Note by Rolf Boldrewood.
Opinions of* the Fress :
** The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, 4 The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain,” — Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they toll, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are Stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. 4 The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and. his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in 4 Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. 4 A Cup of Cold Water ’ is, perhaps the
best tale'in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to jmrely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph
July 15, 1893.
“ ‘The Last of Six;’ and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer,, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here arc good
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”; — Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
