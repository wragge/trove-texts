nothing like ‘Nugget’ Dark Brown Polish for keeping brown

HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes
CAUTION.—The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure, to get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good” as Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-
tions 'and substitutes have no reputation of
their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes.

Sapphics
It is strange to wliat chances a writer s
reputation can be exposed, and what fame
can be thrust upon a poet, especially one
whose works are lost. Thus Sappho, as
woman and as poet, misread and misknown
—if at all either read or klfown —by reason
of an old bad habit of literary essayists.
Neither she nor any other Greek poet of the
great age had the honor of a collected edi-
tion, neither in lifetime nor so soon after'
death as the Shakspeare of the Quartos.
Only after centuries Avas the huge task of
codifying Greek literature accomplished, as
the result of three generations’ toil in
scholarship at the college and library of
Alexandria. The classification, disposition
and arrangement of each poet's work was by
no means arbitrary; but it had nothing to
do with the intention of the poet —which
intention, indeed, never at all existed.
The work of Sappho (with doubtful and
spurious matter included, like the _ Shaks-
peare of the Folio) was set forth in nine
books —the second authoritative edition of
Alexandria—and must have contained ten
thousand lines of verse. The first is certified
to have contained 1320 —that is, 330 stanzas
in the Sapphic metre, the arrangement by
books being according to the metres she used.
Next, within each book, according to that
general law governing the whole Alexandrian
codification—whereby the 16 books of Pindar
fell into two eights—first, poems addressed
to the gods; next, those to human beings.
So then it came about that the first book of
Sapplio was in Sapphics and opened on a
poem (wrongly called ‘'hymn”) to Aphro-
dite, followed by one falsely inscribed ‘‘To
the beloved,” just as every ode of Horace
was gifted with an often misfit title.
Your “brilliant” literary critic depends
for his brilliancy on “preserving his re-
action,” as the phrase was —that is,_ he must
not subject his “temperament” to his author
and so be absorbed in him: he must not go
deep, he must skim —beautifully, of course,
like the “sea-blue bird” of Aleman. The
modern essayist has this advantage over
the ancient —even though lie does not always
trouble to proclaim it—that he has learnt to
“dip”—that is, go to other places in the
book than its opening. The ancient essayists
—liere Dionysius of Halicarnassus and the
so-called Longinus—went no further ; _ quot-
ing respectively I, ii (complete) and I, ii (in-
complete : curiously enough Catullus in his
51st poem does not go as far as “Longinus” ;
Horace’s reference to Sappo in Odes 11,
xiii, need not imply that he had read more
than the first poem). By those two docu-
ments, principally, was Sappho known, and
on them was she judged, up to the year 1896 :
judged, I say, because the true judgment had
won through, even by that date —for those
who could read. And now, before I set
forth the Sappho resurrected from the sands
of Egypt —for those who can read —needs
must I, in my place, tread down the rank
recurrence of ignorance and prejudice.
People of the present day are not in-
terested in Sappho as a poet (how should
they be? Aeolic Greek is not every man’s
meat) but as a “case.” She was a Lesbian ;
and every par.-writer knows the meaning of
“Sapphic” and “Lesbian.” Full-mouthed
ignorance can loudly affirm that the name of
her island, no less than her own, was a by-
word for sexual perversion. As if, then, a
lover and poet like Catullus, in the first
rapture of adoration and gratitude, would
offer his lady no better title than that of
“Lesbian girl,” set in a metre and a poem
adapted from that very Sappho (a sorry
bungle the poor lad made of it, in his effort
to make it speak his passion) ! But was
there not a “Lesbian” practice, which is
often mentioned with abhorrence by ancient
writers? Of course; and this, like other
manners and customs of the old world, is
matter of exact knowledge and strict scholar-
ship. If a man must talk about “Lesbian-
ism” let him first look at Aristophanes’
“Wasps” (1346) and “Ecclesiazusae” (920),
and see what all this can have to do with his
Sappho. Great general considerations fas
Catullus’s use of “Lesbia”) are coolly thrust
out of view, and baseless assertions set in
their place. Now, consider again two mat-
ters commonly ignored, which would give
any sane mind grave matter for doubt before
admitting the charge. Plerodotus mentions
“Sappho, the song-maker,” once, to tell us
how sternly she rebuked her brother in song
for his entanglement with the lady whose
professional name was Rhodopis, in private
Dorieha. And the opposite mainland,
and especially the rich kingdom of Lydia,
was only too happy to send Sappho all
its best-born and fairest girls that they
might become the objects of her “passion”
and, as such, be published in her verse.
It is not permissible to speak or write of
Sappho nowadays without knowledge of
the discoveries in Egypt during the last quar-
ter of a century, which have nearly trebled
the bulk of our Sapplio-book and have be-
yond measure deepened our knowledge of the
woman. Yet, in all this, nothing of the
“Lesbian” lady, the “Sapphic” poet. We
see her there with her girls about her.
They are her thiasos: not a school nor
yet a college, though in some ways a pre-
cursor of the latter; a society devoted to
the cult of the Muses, with its chapel of the
women’s patron-goddess, Aphrodite. She
speaks to them of all the luxuries that make
up their life in common—the fine garments
which she best can teach them to wear with
decorum and grace, the dances and the
cushions on which they will after rest their
limbs, the festivals with their coronals and
unguents. For each departing one she writes
the marriage song, and, when each is far
away, talks lovingly with those still left
how the distant one will often turn her
thoughts to them from Sardis, yonder where
even now the full moon is coming up, “and
she walks pre-eminent among Lydian dames,
as at set of sun the rosy-fingered moon sur-
passing all the stars, and its light dwells
on the salt sea and the many-fiowered meads:
and the dew is shed so fair, and the roses
thrive, and many a tender shrub, and the
blossomed melilote: and what she saith we
cannot hear, but the many-eared night can
bear it to us across the watery strait/’ Pas-
sion, storm and stress are singularly lacking
in this sweet and simple poetry.
But, it is insisted, Sappho has put pas-
sion into that poem which the Alexandrians
set at the beginning of her works, and the
pathology of passion into that which came
second. Certainly ; but it has nothing to do
with sexual perversion or aberration. The
answer is brief and simple. In I Sappho
is passionately desirous of her girls’ ‘affec-
tion.” The relations of the sexes in Greek
classic times were such that of a necessity
romance and passion were diverted into
friendship between members of one and the
same sex, especially those who pursued com-
mon intellectual or artistic aims. Under-
stand what Socrates was among his youths:
allow for difference of sex, and you will
have Sappho among her girls. In I ii, she
gives us (beautifully, but for my taste some-
what too pathologically) the tumult of the
whole body provoked by the sight of physical
beauty. Again, she must be read in the
context of the Greek mind and temperament:
for instance, with “Iliad” XXIV, 6-9-33,
and the well-known fragment of Mimnermos.
Well, but again she did have the reputa-
tion. Yes, but you should make it your busi-
ness to know when, where and how. Any-
one who gulps it down unqwestioningly must
either be prepared to swallow in the same
fashion Aristophanes’ version, of how the
Peloponnesian war came about, “all on
account of” Aspasia (“Acharnians,' o-4-31)
or stand suspected of such vulgarity and
dirty mind as the Romans, in general, brought
to things Greek. Two great modern poets
must for ever bear the guilt of making
Sappho the liigh-priestess of a renewed cult
of tribadism —Baudelaire (who at first pro-
posed to give his poems the general title ‘Les
Besbiennes”) and his ~ follower Swinburne,
against whose “Anactoria” we can now hold
Sappho’s. The dirt that has ensued there is
no need to discuss. It is probably foolish
to hope that Sappho will ever be “delivered
from the dominant prejudice” (Buttmann).
There was a friend of mine once who thought
the universe would lose a beauty if she were.
And, after all, one should not be angry with
the ignorant, when English scholars have
made it a national matter to cleave to the
stupid and dirty faction.
The Australian atmosphere ought to come
swiftly to the call of Mrs. Forrest. She was
a Mills of Parramatta, and the Millses of
Parramatta go back to the early days of
schoolmastering in Australia. From the
old town they scattered far—even to Gal-
lipoli. Mrs. Forrest drove her stakes into
Queensland, and from her claim there she
has turned out more glittering verse than
any other Australian woman—surely as much
as any other half-dozen put together. One
could go further and doubt if any other
woman in the world makes so comfortable a
(Continued on page S.)
Two Bush Novels
There are a million ways of writing a
novel, but there are only two ways to paint
an effective word-picture—(a) by skill, and
(b) by sympathy. In (a) the image is
built gradually by deft additions, deft omis-
sions, hints of drama to come, style, per-
sonality, control of the job—above all, con-
trol of the job. E.g., “The Forsyte Saga,’
“Marius, the Epicurean,” “The Three Black
Pennys,” “Babbitt.” In (b) the image
grows out of the author’s sincerity and
fervor, all the technician-tricks under the
heading “skill” being washed away in the
tide of the fervor which must for its purpose
be uncontrolled. E.g., “John Inglesant,” “The
Cloister and the Hearth,” “Ships that Pass
in the Night,” “The Happy Warrior.” _ In
these what one may call the technician’s
traditional pattern is rejected. The story
emerges hot from the imagining, making its
own often-faulty technique as it goes on, and
triumphantly establishing its right to do so.
Into this (b) class comes Daughters of
the Seven Mile (Hutchinson), Zora Cross’s
first novel, and to me the one purely Aus-
tralian novel written to date. Here, for the
first time in letters, I feel the township and
the scattered community around it, the
jangle, the large calm, the simplicity, the
steadfast, unnoticed courage. Out of these
throbbing pages everything of that life comes
to me nnemphasised and so naturally that I
hardly notice it as it takes its place in my
consciousness. I know that stretch of land,
that Seven Mile, and all its inhabitants; I
know the strains laid upon their hearts, and
the labors they did in laughter, the great
sacrifices they made. I know how the men
looked to the women, and the women to the
men. I seem to know now how the world
and the future looked to all these daughters
and their men, while I lean against the slip-
rails and watch them going by to woman-
hood. I am content that this is the true
vision of that community. I can feel it.
The epic figure of Ann Wilson dominates
the story, her armor of rough magnificence
typifying the labors of the Seven Mile, and
tiie great tenderness beneath the armor typi-
fying its spirit and its rewards. She is the
Bush. Her citadel is taken and re-taken
as the daughters come and go in the sound
of the music of the town; but the citadel
remains impregnable, while the town slowly
crumbles and is forgotten. The story opens
with Ann’s birth in the Bush, and closes
with the birth of her granddaughter, still
safe in the heart of the Bush.
Here, then, for me is the beginning. We
have the piquant stories of Henry Lawson’s
tragic, tender mind; one or two suburban
pictures by Arthur Adams, as much Adams
as picture; and “The Desert Horizon,”
Grant Watson’s very well written but too
portentous story of Western Australia. These
show us rather their authors than Australia.
“Daughters of the Seven Mile” shows me no-
thing of Zora Cross, nothing of her style, no-
thing of her literary personality. It shows
me the Seven Mile as vividly and truly as
if I had lived there all my life.

DAVID JONES*. :
OPP. G.P.O. For Service SYDNEY
living out of the measures she pours into the
n °To P add r mint sauce to her lamb, Mrs. For-
rest does a little in prose ; but she has not
until now attempted a long novel. £
brings a full palette of color to 2he TI ild
Moth (Cassell) ; and color is her strong suit.
Her pen darts between her beloved Sydney
and her equally beloved Queensland ot the
wide, open north and west; and she fills the
spaces with graphic pictures.
And now they were climbing into the gum-
crowned ranges—
“ Wild Moth” is having her great adventure,
a trip to Sydney, and she has left first Bris-
bane and then the “farming country, yellow,
rainless ; dejected hayricks on a shimmering
skyline”—
And now they were climbing into the gum-
crowned ranges. Dell began to rush from window
to window. She thought she could never tire ot
that far blueness, the ranks of leaning trees, here
a bare grev slide where had been a landslip, in places
the white overturned stems of trees like broken teeth
in a giant’s jaw. The sudden streams betwixt Die
dark-glossed foliage; Helidon far below', white-
roofed • plane trees throwing their delicate shitting
shadows cn a sandy platform; Spring Bluff with
its sharp grade; on and on till .Harlaxton fronted
the curve and they had steamed into Toowoomba—
Toowoomba where a cold wind was blowing and
the girls on the platform w'ore furs.
In Sydney then, and up Lane Cove, where
poetry “dusts gold on the gum-leaves, spins
rhythm with the slow-swaying boughs of the
great Moreton Bay figs, couches for a space
in dusty, sweet-smelling grasses, even flirts
a pinion over a red-roofed jetty house, and
then rests in the musky hidden places, wait-
ing for moonshine and lovers.” Rich color
everywhere.
The story, which in a somewhat condensed
serial form ran through the Australasian,
counts for less than the pictures by the way;
yet there is enough to keep the interest alive.
Dell Ferris calls “Black” Ferris her father;
and Black Ferris is the bad man of that
section of the cattle country. Two other men
are in the foreground: the owner and the
manager of the run on which Ferris is an
unwelcome selector. Dell is loved by. both,
and is in love with one; and it is this one
who shoots and kills when the drunken Ferris
is making a murderous attack on the girl.
Thereafter a “bloody hand” is understood
to make it impossible for the pair to marry ;
and you have to wait till the end —a not
very strongly written end —to find out how
the'extraordinary difficulty is removed. There
may be young Australians of the saltbush
and mulga country who would think a little
accident like that a sufficient bar to mar-
riage. Most of them would certainly be
much more practical about it, and declare
that a live blackguard was not much of a
hindrance and a dead one no hindrance at
all. However, Mrs. Forrest makes it all
credible, and, incidentally, lets Sis and Jim
of Further Out see a little of flat and board-
ing-house life in Sydney, and. half a dozen
interesting people who move in and out of
artists’ studios.
S.H.P.
To a Finish
The idea of writing sequels or continua-
tions to well-known works —which in the
case of Sir Harry Johnston’s “The Gay
Dombeys” gave such remarkable results —
seefns likely to become a permanent feature
of the literary landscape. _ It is not, of
course, an entirely new notion; but in its
new development there is a certain daring
and freshness which did not belong to the
older attempts. One of the latest examples
is The Lady of Belmont, by St. John Ervine,
which takes up the thread of “The Merchant
of Venice” 10 years after the curtain falls
upon Shakspeare’splay. The dramatist dis-
appoints through his failure to write with any
semblance of Elizabethan diction; but his
development of the characters is moderately
interesting. Antonio has become a bore who
never ceases to tell the tale of the pound of
flesh he so nearly lost ;■ Bassanio is a mere
rake and libertine who has already squan-
dered most of his wife’s ample fortune;
Gratiano is drunken and dissipated; Lorenzo
is the rather boresome dreamer; Shylock
is the grave, kindly elder who has been
honored by the Duke of Venice and holds a
place on his council; Portia is the fine,
serene matron, still loving her rakish hus-
band, and bravely hiding her wounded heart:
Nerissa is a narrow, querulous, faded
woman, bringing her constant complaints of
Portia; Jessica is the mean little sweep, who
wasted her father’s keepsake jewels in the
original play, now engaged in a disreputable
intrigue with Bassanio. The shapes that
these people have taken during the 10 years
between plays arc reasonably convincing:
and there is enough plot and general interest
to carry the piece.
What is most interesting about it, how-
ever, is the suggestion that by a mental con-
tinuation of any play a certain side-light of
criticism is thrown on the original work. It
is clear that from the nature of drama the
curtain often falls upon a series of human
events which are merely prelude to matters
of far greater importance. Sliakspeare and
his contemporaries may have had some such
idea in their minds when in their great
tragedies they completely mopped up the
possibilities of the future by strewing the
stage with dead; but in the comedies much
is left to the imagination. “The Merchant
of Venice” offers us a set of people who,
with the single exception of Shylock, are
curiously light and unimportant. Nobody
would care greatly to meet any of the three
married couples whose actions have given a
passing interest to the dram#; Gobo is the
dullest clown in all the comedies; and
Antonio is a sort of heavyweight preacher
from whom it would always be a good thing
to get away. But take the play of “As You
Like It,” and exactly the opposite is the
case. No one can deny the grace of Orlando
or the sweetness of Rosalind; Touchstone is
a genuinely merry fellow; and though
.Taques is something of an ass, the duke
would be a brave friend and companion any-
where. You feel quite naturally that all
these people would carry beyond the cur-
tain. They are not big folk, but they are
simple and kind and human. If the purpose
of all art be to set waves of imagination in
motion which have a far wider scope at last
than the artist’s original theme, then “As
You Like It” comes out of the test far
better than “The Merchant of Venice.” A
dozen continuations of “As You Like It,”
which faithfully followed the likely move-
ments of the characters, would be as bright
and hopeful to the last curtain, even though
Orlando walked with a stick and Rosalind
admonished her grandchildren to respect hex-
snowy hair.
If the sequels of such plays should be
popular and desirable, there is one which I
should like to possess the large grace to
write. It is the true ending to the divine
comedy of “Macbeth.” The play ends with
the head of the hero being carried roxind in
a triumph of blood and rather cheap rhetoric;
but if Shakspeare’s hand actually wrote the
closing scenes, that hand was forced by cir-
cumstances. Does anyone really believe that
Macbeth was killed by the ranting Macduff?
To me it seems utterly impossible. The
witches having failed, the wood having moved
and the man not born of woman being
before him, Macbeth tries “the last.” I can
see how, in dependence on himself alone,
the rebels with all their allied “English epi-
cures” were driven from the walls; how, evexx
while the trumpets blared of victory, the
doctor returned with radiant face to say
the queen was not dead after all. I can
see the hosts of Hell and the supernatural
driven back before the spirits of a man and
woman too strong in elemental force for all
the devils. Visions, witches, cauldron,
broomsticks and all, they retreat in vague
dances and incoherent mutterings; and Mac-
beth is king of Scotland in honor and love
as the man best fitted to rule. History not-
withstanding, I believe Shakspeare meant all
that. The murder of Macbeth is the greatest
blot upon the English stage. There, in spite
of all the minor incidents, are the two great-
est lovjers of all time driven into crime by
forces from without. To say that they did
not overcome those forces is to assert the
eternal impotence of human life. It is the
sure knowledge that Macbeth and his queen
did overcome that makes me want to write
that sequel. Though a feebler hand might
pen the lines, I feel that in setting them
down I should be following the mind of the
master; and Will Shakspeare—even if his
baptismal name was Edward —would rise and
applaud.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Bad Rhymes?
Richard Meredith’s article on Assonance
(R.P. 17/4/’24) illustrates the almost un-
conscious effects on the ear or similarity of
sound. But it is worth noting that the
men who have made verse their medium are
sometimes wearied at the sameness of the
effects they are • producing. Their work
keeps falling into the same rhythms: there
is always the rising iambic stress, and
always the answering clinch of the rhyme.
The ease of Dryden’s couplet (gained after
20 years’ experience of writing plays in
rhyme) shows that his thoughts fell within
its form instinctively and without effort;
and Byron, towards the end of “Childe
Harold,” found that he could build up the
complicated Spenserian stanzas with less
difficulty than if they were couplets. But
to a poet whose aim is that his rhythms
and harmonies shall be not only beautiful
but new and original, the way in which his
thoughts fit themselves with so little trouble
into certain stereotyped forms must be
galling and in time become a reproach to
his sincerity. He is eager to push on be-
yond the realms he has conquered, and ex-
plore new and untried melodies.
Some such desire is at the root of the
eccentricities of free verse, but it can be
illustrated just as well from the development
of Shakspeare’s blank verse in his latex-
plays. likewise in the choruses of “Sam-
son Agonistes” Milton seems to have found
that the variety and harmony of even the
lines of “Paradise Lost” were in danger of
becoming stereotyped, and to have felt the
need for some subtler form of expression.
A similar reaction against the mimicking
echo-tones of rhyme can be traced. One
feels that it must be at the root of the very
large number of so-called bad rhymes whicii
are scattered (without any detriment to the
pleasure of the ear) throughout Shelley’s
“Adonais.” It surely cannot have been
mere carelessness that rhymed “god” with
“road,” “Paradise” with “melodies” and
“last” with “waste,” or suffered such lines
as these :—■
He lives, he wakes —’tis Death is dead, not he;
Mourn not for Adonais. Thou young Dawn,
Turn all thy dew to splendor, for from thee
The Spirit thou lamentest is not gone;
Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!
or again, this :
Out of her secret Paradise she sped,
Through camps and cities rough with stone and steel,
And human hearts, which to her airy tread
Yielding not, wounded the invisible
Palms of her tender feet where’er they fell.
But if one cannot be perfectly sure of
Shelley’s aims, there can be no doubt that
effects of this kind are deliberate in the
work of such a careful artist as Rossetti.
In the most famous stanza of “The Blessed
Damozel” there is not one perfect rhyme,
yet this in no way detracts from its beauty:
“We two,” she said, “will seek the groves
Where the lady Mary is,
With her five handmaidens, whose names
Are five sweet symphonies,
Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,
Margaret and Rosalys.”
In “The Staff and Scrip” the whole success
of the poem is made to depend upon this
device. The falling away of the stanza in
the short last line is often intensified by
a weakening of the rhyme:—-
She sent him a sharp sword, whose belt
About his body there
As sweet as her own arms he felt.
He kissed its blade, all bare,
Instead of her.
And in another stanza where the same i-hyme
is used the effect is heightened by the em-
ployment of a light ending at the con-
clusion :
Next day till dark the women pray’d
Nor any might know there
How the fight went: the Queen has bade
That there do come to her
No messenger.
In such a stanza there is no perfect i-hyme,
but the whole effect is made to depend upon
the subtle variation of similar sounds in a
position where the ear expects them to be
identical.
Another form of relief from the conven-
tional echo of rhyme is to be seen in the
experiments of Wilfred Owen. Here the
words at the ends of the lines have identical
consonant sounds and the vowels are dif-
ferent. Through the similarity of the con-
sonants he focusses all the attention upon the
diversity of the vowel sounds: —
It seemed that out of battle I escaped,
Down some profound dull tunnel Time had scooped
Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.
By such a device the full beauty of the long
vowel sounds is brought out; and by thus
contrasting them the ear gives them an atten-
tion that is rarely given them even by the
most critical. This is the very opposite of
assonance, which aims at drawing attention
to a sound by the comparatively crude
method of repetition.
R. C. BALD.
A Satchel of Books
Nor All Tliy Tears, by C. Nina Boyle (George
Allen and Unwin). A story of family ghosts that
refuse to be laid. A quaint town in Brittany serves
for background, and the author knows her place and
its people.
Heu-Heu, or the Monster, by H. Rider Haggard
(Hutchinson). Another story of adventure by Hag-
gard’s inexhaustible friend Allan Quatermain. The
garrulous old explorer is led to track down a huge
anthropoid ape, and the terrible perils he faces to
provide Haggard with royalties are worthy of a better
objective.
The Dream, by H. G. Wells (Jonathan Cape).
Rather cheap stuff this. Wells’s Harry Mortimer
Smith, who lived in the days of the Great War, is
the person one Sarnac thought he was in a dream
he had in a.d. 3924 or thereabout, though by that
time a.d. had no doubt been abolished —Christianity,
at any rate, had long since been improved beyond
recognition, and most things else, apparently. And
in those days of tremendous progress Sarnac held
up the traffic long enough to tell a small crowd
of picnickers about his dream—-300-odd pages of it.
Picnic parties are, it seems, to be pretty slow affairs
in the year 3924. It is easy work, especially if you
are helped by a bad liver, to find fault with the
world of to-day, and Sarnac pours ridicule on most
things, from war to corns. But he doesn’t tell us
how either war or corns were got rid of: Sarnac
does all the talking—when the picnickers interrupt
he tells them that he will never get through if they
do that sort of thing. Mr. Wells knows what he is
about. Interrupters must be sandbagged if you are
to pull off a publishing job like this. Certainly
the book is entertaining ; certainly the world is full
of shams and absurdities. But the tremendously
superior airs which the people of the year 3924 wear
are rather tiring. Why shouldn’t we put on a few
ourselves? Even a very moderate optimist might, be
able to note an improvement or two that have
occurred in the last couple of thousand years.
“J.8.D.”: “Brian C. Fitzpatrick” admits (R.P.
8/5/’24) that society lacks the will to be Christ-
like, but “believes that it can become Christlike”:
“There have surely been instances enough in history
of the power of the better part of human nature to
overcome the worse to make an enumeration quite
unnecessary to the informed.” I wish he had credited
me with less information and enumerated some of
these instances. The best society has done, according
to my reading of history, has been to throw up
from time to time a Christlike man who has pre-
sented it with an inspiring idea, which may or may
not have been accepted, but which in any event left
it little better morally than before, and usually a
good deal worse. A thousand examples might be
cited, from Moses to General Booth. Take a re-
former who is neither very modern nor very ancient,
and who was behind a movement which in a sense
succeeded —Wilberforce. He did much to get the
Middle Passage abolished, but worse horrors were
going on in the prisons of England and in the slums
of London of which he took no cognisance. A
generation later children were being worked naked
in coal-mines for 14 hours a day (usually attached
to small trucks), and another Ohristlike being
appeared in the person of Lord Shaftesbury. He
was chiefly instrumental in getting English women
and children taken out of the mines ; but a recently
issued report of conditions in Glasgow city indicates
that the lot of the poor is as frightful there as at
any time in the history of the United Kingdom.
In Scotland, according to evidence given before the
Housing Commission, 8.4 p.c. of the population live
in one-room houses which have neither sanitary
conveniences nor water and in which children under
one year die at the rate of 210 per 1000. The society
that Chaucer presents was certainly an incomparably
happier and more Christian one' than that which is
disclosed in, say, a novel of Wells or Arnold Bennett.
We know for certain that a period of Cromwellian
repression will be succeeded by one of looseness,
that the scandals of a Regency are likely to make
the rigors of Victorianism acceptable, and that a
Victoria will cause an Edw'ard to be greeted with
Bacchanal cheers of relief. But that is about as
far as the world gets on its way to the High Place,
and for my part I cannot see that anything is to
be gained by pretending to the contrary. A Christ-
ian bishop, who may be assumed to speak as an
expert on such matters, put it this way on Anzac
Day: “Emperors, kings and autocrats have mostly
passed away, and the old aristocracy has mostly bled
to death. But a new aristocracy and a new auto-
cracy has arisen. Money is the world power to-day.”
If “Brian C. Fitzpatrick” is capable of believing
that education will make the world swing back from
that stage of ethical development to the stage when
the world power was the Gospel message, then he
possesses the kind of faith that moves mountains. I
lack it myself and yet am not cynical, as he
suggests, but think the human race lovable and
the world a good place to live in for those capable
of standing up to it.
“John Scott”: For whom does Harry Dean (R.P.
24/4/’24) think poets write? If it’s for the public,
they don’t care whether the poetry is padded with
adjectives so long as the poet can conjure up a
mind-picture, or set the heart throbbing a little
harder —a little like it did in the old days when
one could love and hate. Take the verse of Roderic
Quinn that Mr. Dean reads with regret:—
Half curtained in the mist and rain
Lay gleamless lake and still lagoon;
Harsh crying, overhead a crane
Flapped heavily o’er ridge and dune.
This may not be good poetry; I don’t know —I
don’t understand the business of stringing verses.
But I do say that the verse brings a picture to the
mind of many an old gunlover who wandered dream-
ing by lake and lagoon in the mist of the morning.
It would mean more to the man who knew that class
of country than the verse eulogised by Mr. Dean: —
Far splendor flashed and glimmered
On reef and shoal and bar;
The silver cornet calling
Drew beauty from afar.
I read Kipling’s
In the sudgy, squidgy creek
Where the silence ’ung that ’eavy
You were half afraid to speak.
I suppose it is deplorable verse ; but it came back,
even after many years, when I first entered the
winding tidal rivers of the tropics under a canopy
of mangrove. And so Rod Quinn’s “sullen,” “slug-
gish,” “plodding,” etc., are needed to conjure up
before the people the picture Rod Quinn saw. I
will give Mr. Dean a dozen attempts without the?
adjectives he deplores, and I’ll wager that the men
who read poetry and don’t write it will prefer
Rod’s verses.


Why the Belt-Drive
does
Better Work.
The outstanding qualities of the
SILENT BELT-DRIVEN
SHEARING MACHINES
—their simplicity, reliability and slight wearing of parts —are the
natural results of a mechanism that comprises only thoroughly sound
engineering principles.
Experts the world over have been quick to recognise that the
BELT DRIVE, FAST AND LOOSE PULLEYS and UNIVERSAL
JOINTED DOWN SHAFT are distinct advances in the evolution of
the Perfect Shearing Machine.
The Belt Drive is the world’s accepted means of power trans-
mission. In the factory and the field it is used for transmitting
power to operate machinery for countless different purposes. No
other method has been found to equal it for practical, reliable service
and economy.
In the COOPER BELT-DRIVEN SHEARING MACHINES
the great advantages of this mode of transmission are well demon-
strated. Noise and vibration, slipping and loss of power are
entirely eliminated. From start to finish the machines run with a
smooth, even motion—there is none of the intermittent knocking
that comes of sideplay and flattened wheel surfaces. The belt from
the large wheel grips right round the small pulley and results in a
constant, positive, silent drive. This Fast and Loose Pulley Belt
Gear is simplicity itself. It is easily installed and easily cared for.
The steady, even working of all its mechanism brings wearing of
parts and cost of upkeep to a minimum. It enables shearing to be
put through without stoppages and delays that are so annoying to
owner, expert and shearer.

Faith.
They that have faith in a life hereafter —
Faith that is born of the fear of death —
What can they know of the mocking laughter
Carried to me on the dawn-wind’s breath?
Happy are they who believe so lightly.
I know that you who are gone are dead —
So many clean bones gleaming whitely,
So much dust of a richer red.
Also I know that if they should hide me
When I am dead in the desert sand
A wind would gather and strew beside me
Dust that had been your cool white hand.
Or if I sank in the deepest ocean,
There to decay in the weed, the sea,
Gentle and sure in its endless motion,
Softly would gather the silt of me,
Driftingly up to the surface bring it,
Whip it to foam on a curling wave,
So that the wet sea-wind might fling it
Over the flowers that deck your grave.

Winter.
The rain comes drifting from the sea,
From tossing leagues of green and grey,
Past thunderous waves that break and flee
And headlands hoar with shattered spray;
Its touch has chilled the heart of me
And swept the summer world away.
Joy is no more; the sun is cold,
The world is dark with wind and rain;
Storms at the shrouded windows scold
And chill drops cling along the pane.
Oh, happy days of blue and gold !
Oh, summer, summer, come again!

Young Song.
The years were young when Virgil set
His budding vines to song,
Young as the scent of mignonette,
Or an evening warm and long,
Or a fiddle’s cry, or the lips that sigh
When love dreams long.
The dew upon the grass was young
When Rosamond was fair,
Young as the light the torches flung
Along the turret stair,
Or the white of milk, or the song of silk,
Or Mary’s ribboned hair.
The world was never old at all,
Nor shall be till it dies;
For it answers the young sea’s call
Beneath the younger skies.
The moments pass like lad and lass
With laughter in their eyes.
If one should walk with withered hair
And cry that life is cold
His breath blasphemes the silver air
And all the sunset’s gold; v
For even death that holds the breath
Dies when a moment old.
I met a wrnary man of years,
Bent low upon a staff,
But he, for all the salt of tears,
Had heart of grace to laugh;
The jest he flung was fresh and young—
The years blew off like chaff.

I sought me fame in the old, mad world,
I gave good blood in fee;
But hot-foot went I, rash and young,
And divil a laurel Fama flung
To the eager hands of me!
And I said, “Old World, you may regret,
That you did not give me fame!”
And I cried, grim-voiced, “You’ll tremble
yet
At mention of my name!”
And I went and built a small green gate
Down where the stone walls be;
And “Will-to-Work” and “Will-to-Wait”
I graved on a tiny key.
Oh the birds that sing on the other side,
When the small green door has slammed!
Oh the sun that laughs in a windy place
When I’m out in space! All Time's blue
space!
And the World can go be damned!

The Night World.
Combers curved and wide
Shoreward smoothly swing,
Shining as they roll;
Softly moves the tide
Over moonlit rocks,
Like a weary soul
Homeward journeying.
Silent is the night,
Save when, now and then,
Haunting shadowed trees,
Breezes low and light
Whisper of strange things.
Ancient mysteries,
And pass on again.
Dews of night a-drip
Fall from leaf and limb;
Up the midnight coast
Slowly moves a ship,
All her canvas set—
Shrouded like a ghost,
Pallid, faint and dim.
Can this be the world
That I knew at noon?
Nay; and verily
Never ship unfurled
Sails like yonder sails,
Under such a moon,
Over such a sea.

WHAT NEXT IN FRANCE?
, ,
Ax explanation of the disaster which has
overwhelmed all the French political groups
that miiirxl in onti Pni-manicm Wnvw
that are united in anti Germanism, however
much they may differ on other issues, is to
be found in the national character. The
... .
trench are idiotically suspicious, and they
lack steadfastness. A German propaganda
item which has appeared thousands of times
in newspapers all over the world presents
, * ~ u, ,
loincare as the awyer tool of the French
capitahst. A one have better reason to
know than the French that capitalism, as
such, means nothing to this sexagenarian
ascetic. who would be ten times richer
~ . . a •
than he s - ated on his
Bar practice rather than on the service of
his country. Yet the oft-repeated libel has
certainly had an effect on the voting. The
French are in the Ruhr primarily for secu-
rity, as the British are in Malta, Gibraltar
and on the Suez Canal. Gabriel _ Hano-
TAUX, France’s most illustrious living his-
torian, mentioned the fact with approval the
otlier day. But such insurances demand
heavy premiums. Freights and fares on the
railways were recently raised respectively 12
and 50 per cent. It was proposed to make
an all-round taxation increase of 25 per
cent., and there was even talk of income
taxation on a large scale—an impost which
is intolerable to the French. Nearly 125
milliards of francs have been spent on restor-
ing the devastated regions, allowances to
soldiers’ families, emergency help, military
pensions, etc.; and as always happens, much
of it has been mis-spent. The taxpayers
from whom practically the whole of this so-
called “recoverable expenditure” was raised
in the form of internal loans know all about
the irregularities, through Communist papers,
such as L’CEtjvre, and they also know that
barely one milliard of francs has so far been
wrested from the Germans. A race of harder
fibre, such as the English, might have been
trusted to hang on, but the French, who
were prepared to accept defeat at least once
during the late Avar, are traditionally un-
reliable in adversity.
*'•»**
The list of public men whom the electors
have cast out is much less ominous than
the tally of those who have been brought
back from a well-earned retirement. Amongst
the defeated is Leon Daudet. He is what
Ave call an Empire Man. His strong suit
is monarchism, and he employs the extrava-
gant and often absurd rhetoric of his kind
the world over. General De Castlenau,
another reject, has his closest.analogue here
in one of those Orangemen who travel poli-
tically on the loyalty ticket: he is a Catho-
lic leader with anti-Semitism and the Flag
as his chief platforms. The intellectual
flower of the Clemenceau party have been
routed, including Andre Tardieu. Clemen-
ceau and Poincare are antipathetic, and
only came together during the war on
patriotic grounds ; and as a militant atheist
and anti-clerical the ancient “Tiger” is hated
by the Monarchists and Catholics. How-
ever, he is nothing if not an uncompromising
Nationalist and anti-German, and the defeat
of his three most formidable colleagues is
a remarkable score for Berlin. These Maxi-
malists of the Right have been replaced by
Communists and Defeatists. Two dangerous
traitors in Malvt (banished for five years
for his share in the Caillaux scandal) and
Marty (imprisoned for fomenting a fleet
mutiny with the help of German money)
are amongst the successful. The spirit of
8010 Pasha, the spy—shot for a crime no
worse than that of Marty —may be presumed
to have followed the returns with a sense
of rage against the discriminations of Fate.
Had he survived he would probably, in the
present temper of France, be a national
hero to-day.
* * * *
The verdict can only mean that the French
are prepared to evacuate the Ruhr. The pre-
sent generation feel, apparently, that they
have sacrificed enough in the interests of
posterity. For lowered taxation in the pre-
sent, and the prospect of shaming something
in the way of reparations out of Germany
in the near future, they are disposed to let
the fallen giant get up again. The imme-
diate effects should be beneficial all round —-
as when the village plutocrat decides to cease
living on his income and instead to “blew T ”
the whole of his capital inside five or six
years. Germany is ripe for a quick recovery.
The formation of the Rentenbank has stabil-
ised the currency. The mercantile marine is
as strong practically as ever it was. The
prejudice against the German trader has
pretty well vanished: in fact, in Britain,
where Liberalism has adopted pro-Germanism
as a plank, it often pays better to be Ger-
man than French. Trade unionism, which
before the war was nearly as strong in Ger-
many as in Australia, is now even more de-
bilitated there than it is in the U.S.A. The
eight-hour day has been dropped, and wages
are at bedrock. The McKenna duties, Bri-
tain’s last barrier against the sweated goods
of the Continent, are to go in August.
Everything points to a tremendous German
output of manufactures. Australia should
benefit: the great German industries, which
are already competing fiercely in woollen and
worsteds with Bradford, Leeds and the
Ulster textile centres, will patronise the
Commomvealth’s chief industry more than
ever. France should benefit: the German
millionaires who are crowding the Riviera,
the Swiss Tyrol and other expensive plea-
sure resorts, will buy her jewellery and vin-
tage wines. Britain should benefit: wealthy
Germans will come to the West End of Lon-
don, as in the past, for their suits and boots,
their 12-bore guns and split-cane trout-rods,
their Rolls-Royce cars and other luxury
goods. And what then? France’s national
life will rest on two contingencies: (1) that
her virile, highly-organised and industrially
skilful neighbors, who number 65 millions
and who went to war 10 years ago for
colonies in which to place their surplus
people, have changed in character, losing
all their ambition and truculence; (2) that,
even supposing they remain as predatory and
hate-inspired as ever, there will be no danger
in letting them grow stronger than ever,
since the moral force of the League of
Nations will be adequate to control them.
One of the latest authoritative works on the
League (“The Revival of Europe,” by Pro-
fessor Alexander, M.A.) contains this pas-
sage :
If the British people want peace, if they want
the League of Nations to become a reality, they
must act consistently. They must be ready to give
up Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, control of the Suez
Canal, mandates in Central Africa and the near
East; Cyprus to Greece, Malta probably to Italy,
Gibraltar perhaps to Spain, the African territories to
German mandate, the Near East to independence.
If the League of Nations can induce Britain
to perform that splendid repudiation of
Imperialism, it is possible, though not cer-
tain, that Germany may follow suit and con-
sent to be for ever as humble and insigni-
ficant as she can. In the other event she
will again hitch her waggon to the star of
power. Just as no one now remembers war-
time vows about never doing business with
another German, so in a few years no one
will have a word to say against the creation
of another German army and another Ger-
man navy. It is at least as impracticable
to keep a rich nation unarmed as it is to
keep a defeated one insolvent. Inevitably a
day will come Avhen the teeming peoples of
the North will swarm off again in quest of
food-supplying territories, as every vigorous
race has done when it outgrew its own terri-
tory since the beginning of history. On the
next occasion it may be taken for granted
the Germans will make no mistake. And
France, Avhich by sticking to the Ruhr
might have relegated the Germans to the
status of the Dutch, will be the first to go
down in the rush.
LIQUOR IN POLITICS.
The determination of Constantine to keep
religion out of politics led to the construc-
tion of that amazing document, the Atha-
nasian creed. Every statesman has realised
the tremendous danger of opposing creeds be-
coming opposing political parties; yet ; as
in the case of Ireland, they have sometimes
conspired to keep religious feuds alive. Out-
side Ireland and India, however, the question
of religious opinion is rarely a fighting
matter; but views about reform in the field
of doubtful practices have gained almost the
discordant force of the old religious hatreds.
One of the most dangerous questions in the
English-speaking world to-day is that which
relates to the use of alcohol. Men other-
wise quiet and inclined to be at peace with
their neighbors are immediately brought to
a frenzy of indignation over the matter of
prohibition of liquor; and fighting for or
against the so-called reform they are apt to
entirely lose sight of far graver issues. In
practice the holding of licensing polls on the
day of a general election Australia found to
be bad. Thousands came to the polls with no
notion of the respective merits of the candi-
dates or political parties, but merely to vote
for or against no-license; yet, having come,
they stayed to record a perfectly meaningless
choice at the more important ballot. In the
United States, where the bootlegger and the
anti-alcohol gospeller have been fighting an
evil battle so long, the question is about to
be lifted into the central place at the elec-
tions ; and it seems safe to say that Ameri-
can politicians have now a steady job around
the beer-bottle and the whisky-flask which
will keep them blind to all else for a number
of years. In the process of the wrangle
American democracy., never a really robust
plant, may be seriously blighted; and. great
evils may flourish almost unchecked in the
shadow of the storm which rages to secure a
shadoAV of reform.
Religious questions have never been settled
by the democracy. From their very nature
it is impossible that they could be so settled.
Had Constantine taken a vote of the Em-
pire on the question of Christianity and the
Athanasian creed the noise would have
brought the walls of Rome crumbling about
his ears. Similarly, on the question of the
prohibition of liquor, it is very doubtful
whether the voice of the people can get to
any effective result. The matter is hardly
a possible one for political decision, because
it is not one on which legislation can be bind-
ing. In the moral realm the world has always
applauded those who refused to be bound
by a false law. It does not so much matter
w'hether the law is actually false or true;
the fact that the democracy is divided in
feeling about it is sufficient. If one-third
or even less of the people in any commu-
nity decides to resist a law which affects a
daily custom or practice, it cannot be effec-
fiveiy enforced. The weight in the struggle is
always with the law-breakers. They are deter-
mined to have their way, while a large num-
ber of their opponents have merely voiced
an opinion against them which they would
not openly support by the lifting of a finger.
In the case of the prohibition of alcohol the
position is aggravated by the fact that the
drinking of alcohol is mainly a man’s prac-
tice, while a very large number of its oppo-
nents are women ; and the actual force of the
women in upholding the law is not very
great. Even assuming the right of the majo-
rity to make any laws it may consider useful,
the doubt still remains as to the ability of
the democracy to make laws on certain
questions work. Under the old law of South
Carolina divorce was unknown. A marriage
could never be dissolved on any grounds
whatever. As a result men and women who
had separated from their legal partners but
had never been divorced lived openly to-
gether, and were regarded as leaders of
society. The Legislature had even to pass an
Act limiting the amount of cash a parent
could leave to illegitimate children. This is
a fair example of the working of a prohibi-
tive law under democracy. The sympathisers
with the law-breakers were not strong enough
to defeat the anti-divorce party; but they
were strong enough to make its legislation
look ridiculous.
* K * *
A Presidential election fought on the liquor
question must prove a disaster to the Ameri-
can people; but it might teach a lesson to
those who look on. There would of neces-
sity be a division of forces, groups following
certain banners regardless of their meaning.
Men who continually broke the liquor laws,
or even bootleggers, would range themselves
for political reasons with the prohibitionist
faction ; while the soberest of men would be
found fighting the battle for alcohol. This,
in point of fact, is exactly what did occur
in the State of Maine, where for 70 or more
years the Prohibition party ruled without
making any serious effort to reduce drinking.
During that period an occasional official
started a vigorous crusade against the drink-
sellers, who conducted their “sly” business
quite openly; but such efforts were discour-
aged by the party—a party to which the
drink-sellers naturally adhered at elections.
Those drink-sellers were periodically fined;
but they knew that the total amount paid in
fines was far less than the amount paid for
licenses in other States. There can be little
doubt that the whole country now under
Prohibition is shaping towards just such
an end. As a political question, the whole
thing is a godsend to the politician who is
merely in the game for what he can get out
of it. It offers a wrangling-point about
which opinion can grow' heated and debate
furious without matters ever getting to any
definite conclusion. Once the professional
politicians are fully in their stride and
Prohibitionist and anti-Prohibitionist have
taken the places of Republican and Demo-
crat, nothing like real reform can get a look
in. Australia may well watch the trend of
events and take warning. 'J'he liquor ques-
tion is not without its significance to the
State; but far from being’the most import-
ant of social and political questions, it stands
far down on the list.
THE NEAR-WHITE.
*” other day in Macassar I saw that per-
tion of the Dutch colonial army which occu
pies the ancient fort. The garrison had
the aspect of a harem or a creche. Each
Soldier had his native wife —on a war footing
I believe the allowance is reduced to one per
file of four —and blowing about the corri-
dors and squatting under the trees like heaps
of brown leaves were the multitude of their
dusky progeny. The State supports and
finds positions for these sequelae of a recog-
nised system. A ramble along the streets
and canals of old Batavia gives one a
more familiar picture of the mingling of the
races, which, owing to a natural desire not
to offend the susceptibilities of people in
high places, the statistics are unable to con-
firm. It is a picture which has taken
300 years of tropical summers to complete.
The rich brown of the native population
supplies the background; and on it are
etched the sharp profile of the half-caste
Arab priest; the lean face of the Chinese
sinkeh; the fat, masterful visage of the per-
anakan, whose fathers were sinkehs a
thousand years ago, and whose mother is
doubtless a Javanese. Against this moving
middle foreground the rosy cheeks, blue eyes
and flaxen hair of the newly-arrived young
Dutchman gleam infrequently and with an
unearthly radiance promising swift extinc-
tion ; while merging into it, through all the
shades from asliy white to golden yellow,
are the mixtures which make up the bulk of
the so-called European population.
Of the 135,000 people in Java who are
optimistically called white, about 90 per
cent, are of Dutch descent; but only 10 per
cent, of these were born in Holland. There
being practically no disabilities placed upon
the Eurasian as there are in British colonies,
he preponderates in every walk of official
and unofficial life, from the lowest to the
highest, in the army, the civil service, in
trade and industry. As far as numbers
are concerned, he may be said to carry the
white man’s burden upon his shoulders.
Therein lies the problem from the Dutchman’s
viewpoint. As their numbers increase, the
Eurasians will inevitably tend to displace
the whites. The demand for local auton-
omy is growing more and more insistent, and
the ballot-box of the future will not dis-
criminate between shades of color. The
home country will inject less and less of her
life blood into her colonial system, until that
system becomes, to all intents, an oligarchy
of half-castes ruling over a subject popula-
tion of 50 million natives. That is, if the
Chinese and Arabs will let them. Already
the Chinese have wrested four-fifths of the
wealth and commerce of the colony from
its European owners, while the Arabs control
the spiritual life of the people through Islam
and exploit them through usury. Neither
race of Oriental supermen is likely to let
such a rich prize rest in the hands of any
class less capable and energetic than them-
selves. So the Dutchman sees his pet
colony, his beautiful Insulinde which for 300
years he robbed and despoiled and which he
is now beginning to love with the sentimental
affection the ravisher usually acquires for
his victim, passing out of his charge into
that of the near-white. Whether the near-
white is and will remain a fit and proper
person to act as elder brother to the strug-
gling millions of simple Javanese is there-
fore a very important question.
There is plenty of loose writing on the
subject, but little real evidence. The
native calls the Eurasian a crocodile, and
the European would like to exclude him from
his family circle. These are merely ex-
pressions of racial prejudice and do not
prove anything. Biologists, in the seclusion
of their laboratories, have practised on rats,
pigeons and rabbits, and botanists on beans
and peas, and the Mendelian theory has been
elaborated ; but nobody has practised on man,
because it is impossible to observe the
effects of hybridism on homo sapiens with-
out isolating him and his progeny
for several generations. Luckily his-
torical accident and geographical situa-
tion have done what scientists are un-
able to do, and have provided a demon-
stration under perfect laboratory conditions.
This is the now celebrated case of Kisser.
A Dutch scientist, Prof. Rodenwaldt, has
just returned from that obscure islet, where
he spent a long period in collecting all the
available data for an ethnological study of
its people. He is going to publish his conclu-
sions in an important work which will
appear in a few years’ time; in the mean-
time he has given out some interesting
generalisations.
About 1665 the Dutch East India Co.
occupied Kisser, a pleasant little tropical
island lying between Timor and North Aus-
tralia. A garrison of one corporal and six men
were left in charge. These soldiers, as was the
immemorial custom of the Dutch, took native
wives, and their progeny remained on the
island. The company’s power contracted
shortly afterwards, and Kisser was left to
its own resources. In 1811 the British occu-
pied portion of the archipelago, but they did
not extend their control to Kisser, and after
their withdrawal in 1816 the Dutch con-
tinued to ignore the island’s existence. For
nearly a hundred years the half-castes of
Kisser lived in complete isolation. They
married only amongst themselves, and lived
rigidly aloof from the indigenous population.
They received no fresh influx of European
blood or of native. Extremely proud of
their European origin, they were uncon-
sciously providing the conditions for a scien-
tific synthesis. There are at present about
300 Kisserese of mixed blood, 75 of whon
have been removed to another island. They
have long ago lost the superficial traces of
their European descent, such as clothes and
language. They retain their European
names, which are Swiss, Dutch, Scotch and
German —an excellent example of the com
position of the Dutch colonial army—and
they cling tenaciously to a simple sort of
Christianity. There are persons amongst
them with pitch-black hair, black skins and
clear blue eyes; other's with white skins,
fair hair and black eyes: in fact. there are
to be found all the strange combinations
that Mendel produced when he experimented
with pigeons. To those mestizos remaining
on the island Prof. Rodenwaldt applied all
the tests of body measurement, nerve reac-
tion,'intelligence, etc., that are known to
anthropological science, and he found
that there was absolutely no sign of physical
degeneration amongst them. The present
generation recently began to lose its isola-
tion. Several families and individuals have
gone abroad. One is the leading merchant
of Gorontalo, another is in trade in Soura-
baya. Wherever they go they appear to be
able to hold their own. while on the island
itself they have established an ascendancy


oyer the aborigines by virtue of their
superior character alone. As f ar as their
mental attributes are concerned, the pro-
fessor found that the mixed race stood tar
above the pure-blood natives.
To the White Australian some ot these
generalisations are not of vital interest: he
does not need to apply Mcndelian principles
to the uplifting of an aboriginal population
that is rapidly disappearing; but to the
Dutchman, maintaining from a distant base
a precarious hold over a people who are in-
creasing at the rate of half a milk-on every
year, they are of the first importance. The
Portuguese Empire collapsed largely through
the necessities of colonial administration
draining the home country of its good white
blood; it may be possible for the Hollander
to avoid this danger by relying on the
energy of his half-caste brother. Prof.
Rodenwaldt’s investigations discredit the
old notion that the mixed blood inherits the
vices and none of the virtues of both parents,
and assert that the injection of white blood
into the veins of the Javanese will tend to
produce a higher, instead of a lower, race.
This is all very comforting to the Dutch-
man, who finds even in the motherland
plainer and plainer evidence of the increase
of race mixture with the colonial population.
He may flatter himself that the process of
mongrelisation which has been so loudly
condemned by foreign observers is really a
process of uplifting instead of disintegra-
tion ; but it is no argument, as some have
claimed it to be, for the hybridising of a
predominantly white community like the
Australian. There is evidence that mis-
cegenation raises the level of the lower type,
but it is not proved that it does not depress
the level of the higher. Kisser provides no
evidence of what would follow from con-
tinual mingling of the two races. After the
first unions the half-castes married amongst
themselves, and it is doubtful if the colored
strain was biologically of any importance.

Arms No Defence.
Ramsay Macdonald's action in dropping the
Singapore-base scheme without substituting
any equivalent defence project would be
quite incomprehensible if one did not know
the broad notions with regard to defence
that lie at the back of the British Prime
Minister’s mind. The Daily Herald, the
Labor Government’s organ, lately quoted the
following “striking sentences” from a speech
made by Mr. Macdonald when he moved
the resolution last year deploring the “enor-
mous and growing expenditure” on war
preparations, and calling for a conference to
discuss disarmament: —
There is absolutely no national security in military
expenditure.
The British Commonwealth cannot be defended by
fleets or armaments.
People are beginning to feel there is something
devilish in the operations now going on to increase
armies, navies and air forces.
If there is “no national security in military
expenditure,” how is it that Australia for
nearly 150 years has never heard the sound
of an enemy gun? Is it because alien peoples
and possibly hostile nations were all con-
verted to such pacifist tendencies that the
thoughts of annexation or aggression never
entered their minds? Or is it because
Britain’s splendid navy and the still more
splendid fighting reputation of her sailors
kept would-be invaders at a distance? And
how did it come that Britain herself, from
the days of the Armada to the outbreak of
the Great War, was spared any serious
attempt at invasion by foreign Powers which
often had excellent reasons to wish her
utterly smashed and her fleet at the bottom
of the Atlantic? It is idle and foolish to
say the sea was her defence. An unpatrolled
sea is no defence to any country. In the
days when Anglo-Saxons had no fleet to
guard their coasts, the Danes and Norse-
men harried and slew and robbed and raped
from the Thames to the Humber. Later on,
when Harold, the last of the Saxon kings,
had no navy to guard the Channel, William
of Normandy swept over and dyed the field
of Senlac with Saxon blood. As a matter
of fact, the circling sea was a means of
access to Britain in place of being a hind-
rance—until an efficient navy made invasion
almost an impossibility. If the British
Isles cannot be defended by fleets and arma-
ments, how have they been defended? His-
tory tells of a smashing defeat inflicted on
the Armada in Elizabeth’s time; of the
Dutch being repelled time and again by
Blake and other seamen; of Napoleon’s
flotilla being bottled up at Boulogne by Eng-
land’s naval power until the greatest military
genius of the age turned away in despair
and left the “tight little island” to its own
devices. If Britain’s navy did not defend
her on these occasions, what did? Was it
the sudden conversion of Spain or Holland
or Napoleonic France to pacifist prin-
ciples? It may be perfectly true that “people
are beginning to feel there is something
devilish in operations to increase armies,
navies and air forces” ; but it is most cer-
tainly also true that prudent people feel as
well that there is something idiotic or worse
in the conduct of any nation that sees her
neighbors arming to the teeth and neglects
to make ready herself.

Half-hearted Reform.
“The time is fully ripe for a united effort on the
part of all the Churches to secure a reduction in
the amount of horse-racing and racing days. Gamb-
ling is so prevalent that it has become a serious
menace to the life of the whole community.”—
N.S.W. Presbyterian Assembly report.
It would be a very good thing to reduce
the number of racing days, and everybody
knows it; but it would he even better to
reduce the number of bookmakers, and, better
still, to wipe them out altogether. . The
elimination of the bookmakers would, how-
ever, involve the acceptance of the Tote, and
that the Churches won’t have. No one was
ever ruined by Tote speculation: the feat
would be nearly as difficult as to get drunk
on synthetic beer. And there is a suspicion
that this is part of the objection the Churches
have to it. Many of their leaders are
stronger on retribution —which is only an-
other word for revenge—than they are on
minimising misery. They deplore bookmak-
ing as an institution; but they rather ap-
prove of it as a corrective. For a similar
reason they are amongst the best friends
that venereal disease has. They oppose the
registration of prostitutes; they oppose ablu-
tion depots; they oppose compulsory notifica-
tion—in general, they, are in favor of letting
those complaints which are due to sm
ravage the sinner, regardless of the fact that
they must at the same time ravage the inno-
cent. On the drink issue most of. them stand
for prohibition; failing the achievement of
the unattainable their policy appears to be
to keep the liquor position as. chaotic and
discreditable as possible. It is true some
prohibitionists have helped to clean up the
worst of the wine-bars in the big cities; but,
then, these appalling places were doomed in
any event. What they will not do is recog-
nise the futility of the 6 o’clock closing ordi-
nance for the purposes of a city like Sydney.
If the specialists in righteousness were exer-
cised chiefly to make the act of drinking as
harmless as possible, they would accept the
proposition that drinking is never so innocu-
ous as during meals. The logical effect would
be to make them agitate for later closing—
attended, of course, by later opening. If
the Churches and the women, who on most
social problems are found on the same plat-
form, would only get out of their heads the
notion that the way to cure sinners is to let
them stew in their own juice, the world could
be made a much pleasanter place. The con-
trol of vice can only be attained on business
lines. To proceed on the assumption that
it can be eradicated altogether, and that the
road to eradication is to make things as un-
pleasant as possible for evildoers, means that
nothing of value will ever be done, and that
at least as many saints as sinners will suffer.

Prisoners Down Tools.
BathubST Gaol goes on strike: —
Towards the end of last week the large establish-
ment at Bathurst (N.S.W.), which provides accom-
modation and an uncertain amount of employment
for involuntary guests of the State, came to the
assistance of the daily news editors with a “sensa-
tion” even more intriguing than the Long Bay
murder, the hanging of Williams or the serial
exploits of the bright young Victorian affectionately
featured as “Squizzy.” There was a riot in the gaol
that might easily have developed into serious mutiny
and loss of life, valuable and otherwise. It was a
sort of affaire Pentridge, full of journalistic possi-
bilities, alarums and excursions not much less in-
teresting to leader-writers than to caption-creators
and the conductors of correspondence columns —one
which prison reformers delight to base texts upon.
Briefly, the facts were as follow. On Thursday
the chief warder —an official who ranks as third in
command of the prison-—reprimanded an inmate,
who resented his interference with the liberty of
a subject legally deprived of liberty, became violent,
and, after a brief struggle in company with three
active sympathisers, was locked up. With the un-
canny speed with which news spreads through a
prison-—-especially such a one as Bathurst, where
prisoners are practically all “old hands” —every yard
and workshop presently became aware of what had
happened. The majority riotously downed tools, and
made the astonishing demand of the Governor that
the chief warder and his two assistants should be
suspended, and the four prisoners released from the
punishment cells. This, of course, could not ne
done, and the Governor found himself faced with
the makings of an ugly situation. There are up-
wards of 400 prisoners at Bathurst, most of whom
have records that would not recommend them for
membership of the Y.M.0.A., and not a few who
might have been no discredit to Port Arthur at
its worst, with only between 30 and 40 warders to
keep them in order. He was forced to temporise, and
by promising the strikers a full inquiry into the
whole business induced them to go back to work. In
the meantime he communicated with headquarters in
Sydney, and the Deputy-Comptroller, with the Inspec-
tor of Prisons and a reinforcement of warders, arrived
in Bathurst on the following day. On Saturday
morning the Visiting Justice—the local Stipendiary
Magistrate—conducted the promised investigation,
found that the charges against the Chief Warder
were groundless, and punished the four offenders.
Then the storm broke, but did not find the authori-
ties unprepared. A party of police had rein-
forced the warders, and when a hundred or so of
prisoners made an attack upon the latter they
found themselves faced with batons and bayonets,
and were not long in being driven into their
cells, not without some damage—though it is to
the credit of their guardians that the casualty list
was not longer and more serious. Nothing but
decisive action could have saved the situation, and
it was evidently not lacking.
It is many years since such an outbreak has
occurred in the penal administration of N. S. Wales
—the last- was at Berrima in the ’sixties —and it
is bound to be attended with the crop ol
exaggerations and distortions, half-truths and whole
lies, that usually attend upon similar affairs. Al-
ready the demand has been made for a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the prison system of the
State, and as nearly every man thinks he can act
Hamlet, edit a newspaper and reform a prison, such
a demand is not unnatural. If there be any virtue
in Royal Commissions beyond fees for Commissioners,
it might not be a disadvantage to the administra-
tion to have itself thoroughly discussed, dissected
and examined for public information. It would at
any rate leave it less at the mercy of half-liars,
whole liars, and curious sentimentalists who find
Bad Bill and Bloodstained Ben subjects for sympathy
and commiseration because they are bad and blood-
stained. And it would give it a chance to meet
well-meant and ill-meant criticism in the only
fasnion by which either may adequately be met.
♦
The Red Objective.
The N. S. Wales A.L.P.’s idea of a kind
of “recall,” which consisted of certain place-
men or job-holders having power to cancel
the people’s choice of a representative, didn’t
appeal at first sight, so there came hur-
ried assurances that the proposal meant no-
thing. Why it was adopted if it meant no-
thing remains a mystery; but probably the
intention is to bring it into effect gradually
and thus lessen the shock. It is possible to
construct a very fair sketch of the plan
on which Australia is to be governed if the
New Labor —the one which began to blos-
som in the war days, and later assimilated
the Communist doctrine and affiliated with
Moscow —achieves success. It can be con-
densed into these few propositions;—
The State Legislatures are to be abolished and
the Federal principle thrown overboard. There may
be difficulties where an Upper House can’t be
swamped; but if the Lower House is captured and
made to vote its own abolition, a way may be
found to do the rest —possibly a rough and ready
way.
In place of State Parliaments there is to be a
vast array of county councils. The difference be-
tween a State Parliament and a county council is
that the latter will have just such power as the
Central Legislature cares to give it, and have it
just as long as the Central Legislature likes. Its
decisions being subject to review, it won’t be a
governing body.
The Central Legislature is to be reduced to one
House by the abolition of the Senate. If the
requisite majority in the Senate could be induced
to decree its own extinction, the act would, no
doubt, be grossly unconstitutional; but if the States
had lost their separate Parliaments there might be a
serious lack of any constitutional authority to stand
behind the Constitution. There would remain the
courts of law, but they are not armed bodies, and
they could be retired on an age limit and swamped.
And if it is possible to visualise a legislature of
one House for all Australia, and a serviceable system
of “recall” in active operation and with due super-
vision of the elections, there seems no reason why
the new regime should not have a long and profit-
able time.
It is an ambitious programme, but there is
no item in it which is not advocated by a
large number of members of a large and
strenuous party. The abolition of State
legislatures is the first essential, so the
lie is preached with persistence and inten-
sity that this country is a world’s record
for the number and cost of the Parliamentary
institutions with which it is burdened. It
really has six for a continent, and the num-
ber of paid members in the whole crowd is
little more than two-thirds that of the paid
members in the British House of Commons,
and the most important Lower House of
them all is less than half as large as that
of the Irish Free State. Yet the theory
that the land is phenomenally overloaded,
and that great sums can be saved by dis-
mantling the State governing apparatus, has
obtained a vogue far outside Labor circles,
and where three commercial stodgers are
gathered together it is common to find one
among them -who Believes he could buy a
motor-car out of his share of the cost of
State government. The reduction of the
Defence forces is also urgently pressed, in
the name of liberty, Economy, and the
Brotherhood of Man (including Colored
Man) by those who are paving the way for
the new order; and when, at the end of 1922.
the number of permanently employed land
defenders was down to 2073 it Began to
appear that reduction had got pretty close
to extinction. This is an important item,
for a different kind of army will be re-
quired when the Red Objective arrives. And
the Red Objective is steadily moving this
way.
Proposed Federation of the Semi-
detached Kingdom.
It is apparently part of the policy of Bri-
tain’s Ramshackle Ministry to turn the
Partially-United Kingdom, or perhaps the
Semi-Detached Kingdom (the position of
the Irish Free State makes definition diffi-
cult), into a Federation, more or less after
the manner of Australia, Canada and the
United States. The Scottish Home Rule
Bill, which was talked out by misadventure,
but which will certainly reappear, was a
pi’ivate member’s measure, but that signified
nothing. Even highly-important policy bills
have now a habit of appearing first as pri-
vate ventures, and developing imperceptibly
into Government business. The Semi-
Detached Kingdom has already six Legis-
latures for an area much less than half the
size of N. S. Wales, and its Big Parliament
has one law-maker for every 32,700 inhabi-
tants, as compared with Australia’s one for
each 50,400. The five sections of the Par-
tially-United Kingdom which have their own
legislatures are mostly federated in a casual
way, inasmuch as they have members in
the Big Parliament at London, which is also
the local Legislature for England, Scotland
and Wales. The Irish Free State has no
members at London, and isn’t federated, so
the position is untidy and tattered. The
British Labor people consider six Parlia-
ments insufficient; their ultimate aim is,
apparently, to have local or State Legisla-
tures in England, Scotland and Wales also —
possibly two in England, which would other-
wise be ridiculously preponderant, both for
size and population ; and possibly two in Scot-
land, where two races are more distinct than
those of the Irish Free State and the Irish
North-East. Then the great organisation
of Lords and Commons at Westminster will
be the Federal Legislature of all the States
(if Sinn Fein Ireland can be dragged back,
which isn’t likely), and the Unfederal Legis-
lature of the Crown Colonies, and the mutual
friend (or otherwise) of the Dominions.
The Home Rule scheme which is sketched
out for Scotland is doubtless a pattern or
sample. The little country is to have a
One-House law-making apparatus of 143
members to attend to local concerns. Local
concerns wfill include the taking, in some
way or other, for the benefit of a new pea-
sant proprietary, of the bloated holdings of
the Dukes of Sutherland, Athol, Argyle,
Buccleuch and others —at least, if they
don’t it is difficult to see the purpose of the
movement. The driving force of a separate
Scottish Parliament is, of course, expected
to be Glasgow, on the Red Clyde. The mor-
bid growth of that city, which isn’t a capi-
tal or anything in particular save just itself,
has been such that, in 1921, it held over
21 per cent, of the population of the king-
dom, which is a congestion almost without
parallel outside Australia. It is also a
calamitous and degenerate city, and a blot
on civilisation. According to official figures,
40,591 families were lately living in houses of
one apartment, and such conditions don’t
tend to the development of a race fitted for
the highest forms of self-government, or the
highest form of anything. In one-room-and-
kitchen houses there dwelt 112.424 families.
These two classes made up 62 per cent,
of the inhabitants. The proportion who
led their whole indoor existence more than
three in a room was about 28 per cent., and
often the room was barely large enough to
Beat a fair-sized wife in, and so gloomy that
the lady has to be hit almost at random.
The death-rate among one-roomed homes is
rather more than double that among the
four-roomers. Glasgow hardly existed when
Scotland had a sort of Home Rule afore-
time, and the idea of a small Legislature
practically dominated by a Red Clyde
party, which is the product of the tenement-
house life, isn’t very attractive.

Australian Writing and the University.
The question of introducing Australian
literature as a University subject has been
disturbing some of the senates. In one in-
stance at least the decision has been against
it on the ground that no work done in the
Commonwealth is old enough to have stood
the test of time and that consequently no
standard is fixed. At first glance this would
seem reasonable ground to take. In the mass
of work now' being done in the world, it is
by no means easy to judge what will become
classic and what will pass away with change
of literary fashion and new forms of thought.
There may be obscure writers at work whose
place will in the final assessment be in the
front rank or very near it. To satisfy
himself on that point, the reader has
only to remember the cases of Keats and
Shelley, of Blake, even of Shaic'speare
himself —all largely missed by the literary
criticism of their time. The place of many
writers of the Victorian era is still in dis-
pute. Meanwhile, the literary world is full
of the assertion of claims for forgotten
writers —many of them claims that rest on
ground of very slender achievement. Old
seventeenth-century work, which the eight-
eenth and nineteenth centuries left to its
dust, is being reprinted by publishers who
appear to be able to find sales for anything
that is old and unknown. The sifting pro-
cess, as far back as Chauceb, still goes on,
finds much employment for many busy pens
and probably provides a certain amount of
entertainment for a circle of readers. There
is a sense in which literary judgment is
always in flux; and to definitely fix the
classic is not the work of a century, but of
a millennium. The best work done in Aus-
tralia is in no more doubt, then, than the
work of Tennyson, Browning, Matthew
Arnold and Rossetti. Our best may be
small in quantity, but the standard is just as
well or as badly fixed as in the case of any
writer of the second half of the nineteenth
century. A University would miss its real
business if it imagined that it was compelled
to arrange the work of poets and men of
letters into cattle-show pens and award the
prizes on a strict plan, with a “Highly Com-
mended” here and there and a big bunch of
red, white and blue ribbons for the champion
bull of the literary herd. English literature
is a great whole of which the work done
in Australia is part. Any man with the
critical mind —which should be possessed by
a university lecturer on English—who feels
the movement of the broad river of prose and
verse rising in Chaucer and flowing down io
our own day, must be able to form some kind of
judgment upon current work, whether done
in Britain, America or Australia. The stan-
dard is not arbitrary, nor is the lecturer’s
judgment final. The close, critical study
even of poor work might easily be made
more valuable than the mere formal repeti-
tion of things generally believed in univer-
sities about great work. A class that studied
Oliver Goldsmith with critical enthusiasm
might get much further than a class which
devoted itself to merely learning the ortho-
dox notes on 1 John Milton, though no
possible standard of judgment could put
Oliver higher than John. The real trouble
about introducing Australian work into the
university class-room lies with the professor
or lecturer himself. The man who attempts
to lead an intelligent and advanced English
class into this field must know the new and
untrodden field; and the work of preparation
would involve research, thought and a cer-
tain amount of daring. One point, however,
is to be remembered. The bulk of serious
Australian effort in both prose and verse
follows the orthodox British tradition. We
have been far less side-tracked than the
recent writers of Britain and America; and
our work is rarely experimental in the sense
of seeking new form. What we probably
need is one big man in one of our universities
to take the initial step of saying that “Made
in Australia” is not a brand to be despised
in literature.

England’s Triumph.
World-shaking movements are often origin-
ated by persons who have no suspicion of
what they are doing. It is a quaint thought
that Edward IV., one of the cruellest, most
arbitrary and in all respects least democratic
rulers that England has known, should have
warmly encouraged Canton, whose inven-
tion was to almost empty the European con-
tinent of kings and rob the Crown of all
its powers in Britain. The popularisers of
tennis and other ball-games in England did
not dream that they were making a notable
contribution to world civilisation; yet they
probably were. It is hard for people to
hate who have played together, and the less
hatred the nations develop in the coming-
years the better hope there will be for the
survival of our culture. Cricket is too
essentially an English game to have had a
chance of adoption abroad on a large scale.
Though Australasia and Philadelphia
(U.S.A.) took it up, it never flourished in
Scotland, Ireland or Wales; the pick of
those three countries would find it difficult
in an average year to defeat Surrey or York-
shire. But in its own home, being the most
democratic of games, it has done useful ser-
vice in bringing master and man, squire and
yokel together on a friendly footing. Thou-
sands of brewing industrial rows must have
petered out on the playing fields since the in-
ception of the game. Meantime England has
been spreading other games and pastimes all
over the world, and the good work is still
proceeding. Twenty years ago Association
football was unknown outside London and
some of the provinces. Last year a Chinese
XI visited Australia, where the game now
has a firm hold, and at present a team of
Canadians is touring the Commonwealth.
The Rugby game had reached France before
the war; it has since spread as far east as
the Roumanian shores of the Black Sea.
Boxing, too, has been taken up everywhere,
and the result, on the whole, has been to make
for international friendliness and under-
standing. But of all athletic games the
acknowledged king in this respect is lawn
tennis. Players like Tilden and Richards,
Patterson and Anderson are literally the

The Private Detective.
Conan Doyle did the British Empire a bad
turn when he invented Sherlock Holmes.
Save for his addiction to cocaine, Holmes
is all that a good citizen should be; and
he is largely responsible for the high place
members of his calling hold in the hearts
of the English-speaking world outside
America, which has long had cause to recog-
nise the amateur policeman for the abomin-
able blackguard he nearly always is. One
Baxter, who was recently given a well-
deserved sentence of four years in Sydney,
has a record that is fairly representative of
his tribe. Beginning as a gaoler in M.L., he
was about to be dismissed for misconduct
when he resigned and came to Australia.
In this country his life for years had con-
sisted largely of swindling and blackmail.
The activities of the “private inquiry agent”
are confined almost entirely for obvious rea-
sons to obtaining evidence in adultery
divorces. Since such suits in these days of
restitution divorces are rarely brought un-
less intense bitterness has invaded the domes-
tic arena, and since bitterness of the sort
is rare, there is little, if any, money in the in-
quiry business conducted on honest lines.
The custom of men of the Baxter stamp
who practise in all the capitals is, firstly,
to collect evidence against a suspected party
—say, a wife. Armed with this he goes to
the lady and demands payment from her,
her lover or both, as the price of withhold-
ing what he has discovered from the hus-
band. When they run dry he puts his infor-
mation at the disposal of his original em-
ployer. On these lines a single suit may be
made to return a profit of hundreds of
pounds, without half the risk that is incurred
in shop-lifting or pocket-picking. The
assumption of the title of private detective
—-though any criminal is at liberty to so de-
scribe himself—confers an unwritten license
to crawl about gardens and back yards by
night, and even to break into dwelling-places.
It is true that a householder here and there
challenges this fictional right, with the re-
sult that the investigator receives the same
violent treatment that might be accorded an
ordinary malefactor of the sneak-thief or
burglar species in similar circumstances.
But in ninety-nine case out of a hun-
dred the bluff comes off, and the
illegal intruder receives at least as
much consideration as a policeman. The
danger of this state of affairs to the peace
and good government needs no stressing.
It is highly questionable if the private detec-
tive should be allowed to function at all.
But if he is admitted as a necessary part
of our social system, at least care should be
taken that he is of good repute. And that
involves a very necessary system of licensing.
A Life of Odds and Ends.
Dear B., —This is a good year for floating
Dominion loans in London. Not much money
is going into new enterprises, except Gov-
ernment ones, in Britain, for so many of
the old businesses are closed or working
half or quarter time that it would be a
heart-breaking jest to launch out. The
country is the Land of Heartbreak these
days. But taking up loans is an industry.
The borrower hands over his IOU at high
interest, and the collection of the latter
begins promptly. The money doesn’t leave
England—if there was a serious chance that
it would the loan wouldn’t float to anything
like the extent that it does. Owing to the care-
fully regulated rate of exchange it costs so
much to bring real money from England
to Australia that nobody attempts it on a
large scale, and if some people did the long-
distance exchange rate would probably be
regulated some more to discourage the hetero-
dox proceeding. The borrowed money either
stays in Britain to pay interest, or it gradu-
ally drifts hither in the shape of goods, to
the detriment of Australian industry. So
great is the readiness to take chances in order
to keep the wheels languidly turning that
there was even a certain willingness to take
Russia’s IOU for £200,000,000, provided a
small proportion was devoted to reimbursing
British subjects whose assets had been taken
in the Big Steal, and provided Russia went
through the empty form of admitting that it
was responsible for its previous debts. In
these circumstances it is not remarkable that
Dominion loans should go off freely. When
the Queensland Premier climbed down and
intimated that he didn’t claim a general
right to vary or break his State’s agreements
there was quite a rush to close the breach
and prepare the way for new business to be
taken out in “truck.” The other side of the case
is that certain persons, who never doubted
before about the advisability of borrowing
everything in sight and then reaching for more,
begin to doubt now. Like the profligate heir
who raised money at 50 per cent, and had
to take out most of the loan in wine and
dubious pictures, they begin to feel that there
is too much “truck” about the business. An
impression grows that it might be well to
prohibit the export of the gold output, such
as it is nowadays, and for the Australian
Government to buy its gold with its own
paper at current rates instead of letting it
go abroad in payment for goods, and to build
gome more note issue on it. Even the
Queensland Ministry begins to say that the
loan business is overdone, which is equivalent
to the Devil renting a pew in church and put-
ting his heated copper in the plate. In Bri-
tain nowadays a remarkable amount is being
done in the invention of work apart from
the loan industry. The Lloyd George Gov-
ernment took to building houses for the poor
at a great rate and encouraged Local Govern-
inent bodies to do likewise, and as George
had learned in war-time to think in billions
and was no great financier before the war,

Rents were and are necessarily low else there
would have been no relief at all, and the
difference between rent-income and outlay
for interest and other charges constitutes an
annual bill of size. The new British Cabinet
proposes to build 2,500,000 new dwellings
spread over 15 years, and each house is to
have attached to it a pension of £6 per
annum. The inmate is not to be pensioned
but the building is, so that it can afford to
throw itself on the market at a lower rate
than would be otherwise possible. Apart
from the house-building business J. Bull
has kept fairly clear of Public Enterprise,
and has neither gone trawling officially nor
opened a meatshop. He considers plain
relief easier, and possibly cheaper. But his
is essentially a life of odds and ends. —Yours,

Fortunes in Smoke.
From a man in the business:—
How fares it with the man who two years ago, in
response to announcements in the press, set out to
find ‘.‘fortunes in smoke” ?
In the Myrtleford district, the principal Victorian
centre of the tobacco industry, the thing was very
like a gold rush —such as old Myrtleford had seen
in bygone days. The share system attracted a great
many men without capital. The proposition seemed
a mere question of mathematics. One man to five
acres, yielding £lOO per acre (a conservative esti-
mate) ; that was £250 to the share-farmer, living
at roughly £1 per week. In two years he would be
able to invest in a block of his own, on which he
would grow his own food and put on share-farmers
to net him £5OO a year or so from tobacco. Better
than chicken-farming!
Now, I don’t mean to say that the share-farmer
can’t make a living, or even acquire his own pro-
perty from the proceeds; but he wants a lot of
luck. He must, in the first place, pray earnestly
for a good first season. The men who have been
growing tobacco as a side-line for 30 years or more
will tell you that a really good yield occurs once in
three years. Of the other two, one at least is sure
to be a complete failure. The men who took up
the business during the boom have had two bad
seasons in succession, and have for the most part
decided that it is not the game for them. Yet the
press talk was not entirely fallacious; tobacco-
farmers have paid off mortgages and bought motor-
cars. Let us look into the causes of failure in
others—especially the recent invaders.
The first year was a drought. Tobacco is generally
believed to thrive in a drought. So it will—if money
is freely and judiciously spent on it. Certainly, in
a drought year the blue-mould scourge is reduced
to a minimum, and day after day of hot sun brings
the plants on wonderfully, once they have struck.
But consider a paddock, ploughed only once, as
many were, after six hot, dry weeks. It was no place
to put young seedlings to face life on a pint of
water. To water on the surface after planting was
useless unless the ground was flooded. A pump and
engine were required, flooding, say, an acre a day
at 10s. per day for kerosene alone—and there was
work for three men.
The next trouble was the curing-shed. Of these
there are many types, but only an airtight one is
any good. One could dwell at length on the pathetic
makeshifts of poor men, who spoiled much good
tobacco. But a weatherboard or galvanised-iron
shed (complete with lining, flue-pipes and furnace)
cost £l2O at the lowest estimate. A very good
kiln can be made for less money from logs ; in fact,
the best tobacco cured in the Ovens Valley last
season was cured in such a one. But it, is hard
graft for an ex-bank clerk or ribbon salesman to
build one of these; and he still has to buy the
accessories.
Of equal importance is the bulk-shed, in which
the cured leaf must spend the winter. The leaf is
extremely susceptible to mildew, which renders it
unsaleable at any price. The shed must be as air-
tight as the kiln and about four times the size.
Put your hand in your pocket once more —or take a
big risk with your year’s work.
The current season has been from the first dead
against the crop. Tobacco is a summer crop, and
therefore requires a summer. This one has slipped.
Blue-mould was, of course, simply rampant.
Let us assume that next year will be a good one, and
pay £lOO per acre. Assume also that in the drought
year the crop paid £3O per acre, and this year
was a total loss, we have an average gross yield of
about £45 per acre. The cost has been set down
at roughly £2O per acre with a full crop to harvest.
Let it average £lO. We thus get a net average
yield of £5 per acre.
To sum up, it is a profitable crop for a
man with a fat bank balance and lots of experience.
It is ruin for anyone else. The share-farmer will
make indifferent wages if he has money to help him
live for two or three years. But the system is
all in the owner’s favor, in that he suffers only a
small loss if the crop is a dud.
Tobacco is undoubtedly a good side-line, so long
as the B.A.T.C. sticks to us (and it shows every
sign of doing so) ; and it will certainly be a great
thing for the country when we are educated up to
curing a really smokable tobacco. But it is no
more a get-rich-quick crop for the poor man than
any other.
The Sydney Harbor Trust has driven the
P. and O. and Orient vessels into Woolloo-
mooloo Bay. Walsh Bay (Miller’s Point)
was at first set apart for their use when they
were pushed out of Sydney Cove (Circular
Quay), but that location was found quite
unsuitable. The whole business ought to
have been far more carefully inquired into
than it has been. A vague idea got abroad
that the presence of the big ships in the Cove
was a source of great danger to the ferries.
As a matter of fact, on inquiry it would
have been found that the ferries are less in-
convenienced by the P. and O. and Orient
vessels than by some of those which berth
on the west side of the Cove. The oversea
tourist traffic is worth a great deal to Syd-
ney—and to Australia —and for the purposes
of that traffic it is worth a lot to be able
to say that great vessels like those of the
P. and O. and Orient berth almost in the
heart of the city—within a few minutes’ walk
of the principal hotels and so on. It is an
advt. which very few resorts in the world
can hang out. Certainly if the berthing of
these vessels is a source of danger to the
ferries, some other arrangement should be
made ; but there are plans pigeonholed by the
Harbor Trust which would remove the dan-
ger while preserving the advt. Years ago
Mr. Walsh, the Trust’s engineer, proposed
to open out the Cove on the eastern side,
allowing for the berthing there of the P. and
0., and shifting the Orient over to the other
side. It would run into money, no doubt;
but the big cos. would probably be very glad
to find interest on the cost.

“F.C.M.”: The man who wrote on the State
and the orphan girl (B. 17/4/’24) might
well have been more constructive in his criti-
cism. Undoubtedly the orphans suffer grave
disadvantages. But the State has a very
difficult .iob on hand in caring for them.
Institution life, even when mechanically cor-
rect, is admitted by child-specialists to be a
failure. There is a something, maybe social
vitamines, lacking which reacts unfavorably
to the development of the individual. Recog-
nising this the State has adopted the policy
of boarding-out, largely in tbe hope that
some bond of affection may be formed between
child and foster-parent. Fortunately it often
is formed. But the Neglected Children’s
Department (I speak now of Victoria) is
not able to place all its children. There is
a certain amount of prejudice against the
State child. So the women inspectors find
a paucity of really desirable homes offering.
It cannot be too strongly stressed that what
these girls need is not so much wages or
education as friends and a social circle to
take the place of home. That such are lack-
ing must be as much to the discredit of the
people individually as of the State. Not that
improvements even in the general scheme are
impossible. For example, among these girls
must always be some few definitely feeble-
minded. They can do simple work well
enough to earn their own living. But left
to their own initiative in the world the
sequel is too often a return to some home
with another nameless and unwanted infant.
This may happen more than once. Surely
these should be restrained from harming
themselves or society. A permanent institu-
tional life, as useful and pleasant as possible,
would be the most humane and practical path
for them —and the least costly.

“L’Fou”: Here is one of the by-laws adopted
by the Kilmore (Vic.) Hospital:—
No lunatic, or person suffering from incurable, in-
fectious or contagious disease, or chronic epilepsy,
or pregnant woman for confinement, shall be eligible
for admission.
The rule affecting the expectant mother is
still in force, and is practically duplicated
by all our country hospitals. And we subsi-
dise them —pay them —out of the Treasury
to do these things!
♦
“C.H.M.”: The A.W.U.’s policy of forcing
up wages has not been an unmixed boon;
indeed, to most casual workers over 40 it
might be described as an unmixed bane. In
Queensland alone there are hundreds of hale
men, some vegetating in Dunwich, others
perambulating the country collecting police
rations, who could easily procure and per-
form work if the rates of wages allowed em-
ployers to profitably employ the sub-normal.
All the increases obtained by arbitration
awards for station- and field-work have re-
sulted in smaller bodies of men being em-
ployed, with “speeding up” strongly in evi-
dence, the consequence being that even those
chosen for their youth and physique often
have less money to show for the job than
the old rates under more leisurely conditions
would have yielded. One with a year’s work
behind and another in front of him was
forced into idleness through the Union’s
kindness in procuring him an increase of
10s. per week. If the big union succeeds
in its present object of wangling an award
rate for cotton-picking, one of the few re-
maining vistas of employment open to the
old brigade will fade into a mirage, for
such an imposition would undoubtedly scotch
the industry, if it didn’t kill it outright.

POLITICAL POINTS.
Melbourne’s asinine tram strike ended on
Monday after a practically unanimous de-
cision by the men to get back to work. No
one wanted to strike, except those leaders
of revolt who regard every strike as desirable
because it engenders class hatred. And no
one seriously believed there was a moral
justification for it—not even those who in-
spired it. The trammies return, after losing
£26,000 in wages and, what is worse from
their standpoint, with a greatly weakened
morale due to the knowledge that their next
grievance will be scrutinised with cynic
doubts by the public, even if it is a genuine
grievance.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Bavin might
put his own house in order before tackling
the problem of overlapping Federal and
State awards. Under his own law there
are three modes of fixing conditions —by in-
dustrial agreement, by conciliation commit-
tees, by awards of the Court. It is pos-
sible for an employer to be subject to three
conflicting sets of working conditions, and
there are plenty of employers attempting to
work under two. For instance, the shop-
keepers at Newcastle have an award fixing
44 hours as the week’s work and a concilia-
tion agreement prescribing 48 hours. The
award covers all employees, and the agree-
ment covers only unionists, so an employer
has to observe different conditions if he has
both unionists and non-unionists working
together.
When the Whip’s forecast showed last
week that the Vic. Assembly Seats Redis-
tribution Bill would be rejected by
four or six votes on the second reading.
Premier Alec Peacock created a “divarshun”
and got an adjournment to gain time. Though
warned that the motion for the adjournment
of the debate would probably be lost by one
vote, the old warrior, with the aid of stage
thunder, bluffed Labor-leader Prendergast,
who called off a division. Earlier in the day
the acid was put on the Cockies to get the
bill made a policy issue; but Dunstan spoiled
that little effort. Angus, A. A. Billson,
Snowball, Farthing and Everard did not dis-
guise their antagonism to the bill, and Jimmy
McLachlan, an Independent, who sits in
Opposition, also threw stones at it. With
the prospect of only 25 or 27 votes out of
a possible 58 Peacock had no stomach for
a snap division. He probably speculated
upon the possibility of bagging Lind and
McLachlan by readjusting Bairnsdale, of
rounding up sick-man Robertson (a Liberal)
by the following Tuesday, and of getting
Everard or Snowball or Carlisle (opponents)
to pair with sick-man Allison (a Cocky pro-
billite). By such methods minorities are
turned into majorities. But is political life
worth living under such conditions ? The
House is overdue to be sent to the pack, and
the sooner it goes the better.
Britain’s well-meaning Government, hav-
ing given up the struggle to find reproduc-
tive work for the poor, is piling up hand-
some liabilities in the w T ay of charity. The
form its housing activity has now taken is
to build, or subsidise the building of,
2,500,000 homes which are to be let at pre-
war rentals. To enable this to be done
£l3 10s. per annum is to be paid towards
the rent of each house, £9 by the State and
£4 10s. out of local rates. This is to go on
for 40 years, so when the scheme is fully
developed the outlay will be £33,750,000 each
year, even if the rents prove fairly collect-
able. Boiled down, it means that the pre-
sent demands more than twelve pence for
its shilling, and that the Government is pre-
pared to sign more lOU’s in order that the
artificial conditions may continue.
BRILLIANT PROSPECTS.
“The orgy of borrowing and spending still continues. With a public debt of £950,000,000 and
£200,000,000 of Federal and State debts falling due during the life of the present Parliament, the only
effort towards repayment is Dr. Page’s sinking fund, which he contends will wipe out the Federal portion
of the debt in 50 years.”
FEDERAL TREASURER PAGE: “Sun getting too hot, my boy? Well, just plant this acorn,
and in fifty years’ time you’ll he able to get a hit of shelter—if nothing happens
to it, and you don’t die of sunstroke.”
Another of the difficulties that the State
as a landlord has to face has been presented
at Daceyville (Sydney), where the State’s
tenants were recently asked to pay an extra
half-crown per week, the increase being
warranted, it was claimed, by additional cost
of repairs. The tenants having refused to
accede to the demand, the Housing Board
has sailed in with notices to quit; but
whether the Government will back the
Board in wholesale evictions is highly doubt-
ful. The Government had a previous experi-
ence with tenants in the Rocks area. Some
of them, far more recalcitrant than the
Daceyville people, refused to pay any rent
at all. This was when Jack Cochran, an
M.L.A. of the period, earned the title of
“Member for the Rocks” by the frequency
with which he drew attention to the “harsh
action” taken in threatening to evict these
defaulters, though it was usually found that
the rent had remained unpaid for a year or
so. “The police report,” said the Minister
on one occasion, “that this man could easily
pay if he did not spend so much time in
the hotel next door.” Cochran’s retort
came promptly—“ Does the Minister expect
a man to pay rent when there is a pub
next door?”
Snowden, Ramshackle Mac’s Chancellor of
the Exchequer, did a scoff at Br’ i ‘ r 'h indus-
try in the course of the recent ta f debate.
Seventy-five per cent, of British c.otor fac-
tories, he said, “are in the hands of the
banks.” Yet even then they pay wages to
British artisans, which they wouldn’t do if
they were in the hands of the Yanks.
Webb, Railways Commissioner of South
Aus., giving State monopoly a nasty swipe,
tells the public there that “your present pas-
senger and goods cars, and your locomotives,
are almost exactly in keeping with the stand-
ards found in America in 1865 or 1870,” add-
ing that since that time the improvement in
his country “makes a story equal to a chap-
ter from the Arabian Nights.” He hopes,
however, to produce in S.A. many of the
conditions found on the Canadian Pacific —
“from every standpoint the greatest trans-
portation organisation in the world.” Inci-
dentally he prophesies that within 30 or 40
years practically all trains will be run by
electric power.
The idea grows in Westralia that civil
servants who have managed to incur the hos-
tility of prominent Laborites are likely to
fare ill whenever a new Labor Govern-
ment settles itself in office. When Seaddan
arrived, a dozen years ago, the axe fell on
Hare, Police Commissioner, whose activities
in connection with the suppression of strike
disorders had been bitterly resented by cer-
tain union leaders, and on Perth police-magis-
trate Roe, who had given offence by some
comments from the bench regarding the pre-
valence of thieving among shop-hands. The
Government, of course, contended that the
officers were being retired simply because
they had reached the retiring age; albeit Roe
was so far from being past work that he
immediatelv returned to practise as a solici-
tor. Now one of the Collier Ministry s
first official acts is to give notice to quit to
stipendiary magistrate Walter, who has war-
den ed and P.M.-ed for over 30 years. The
ostensible reason is that he is over 60, but
a censorious community recalls that it was
the same Walter, seven years ago, who had
to convict and fine the present Premier for
a speech made in defiance of the War Pre-
cautions Act.
South Aus. Gabor Ministers have decided
to stop Harwell's scheme of bringing boy
farm-apprentices from England—they didn’t
like the name of “Barwell Boys,” for one
thing. Incidentally, the introduction of
farm-apprentices was one of the very first
immigration schemes put forward. Old Dr.
Lang, back in 1848, had a plan to bring
ten thousand boys and girls from the British
ragged schools and workhouses. But the
idea did not take on, and nothing was done.
A consignment of South African wattle-
bark was landed in Sydney the other day for
£1 per ton less than it could be produced for
in Australia. The S. Africans long ago im-
ported the Australian tree and began to
turn it to profit. In Natal, the headquarters
of the industry, thousands of acres are under
wattle cultivation, and the labor is almost en-
tirely coolie (Hindu) —a white manager, an
overseer and a white engineer for the machin-
ery constitute the European staff on a plan-
tation. Against this we probably can’t com-
pete in the world’s market; but for our own
market there is a complete protection if we
like to use it.
A row is brewing over the U.S. proposal
to alter the gun elevations of its battleships,
thereby increasing their range, and ipso
facto making certain British and Japanese
capital ships ineffective. The vice-chairman
of the IJ.S. Naval Affairs Committee
“declares that American experts in inter-
national law affirm the right of the United
States to make the changes, despite the
British contention that it is opposed to the
Washington agreement.” Similarly French
legal experts affirm the right of their country
to occupy the Ruhr, though British and
American ones deny it. The result is sure
to be the same in both cases—those who are
strong enough to disregard the laws will do
so. The only difference between the new
world and the old is that the new world
wants to do its fighting on the cheap, being
hard up.
A preposterous cable was printed a few
days ago:—
Dr. Littlejohn stated at the Imperial Service
Hygienic Congress that 54 per cent, of all the births
in Australia between 1909 and 1920 were either
illegitimate or within nine months of marriage.
It will probably be found that Dr. Little-
john didn’t say anything of the sort. He
was guilty of a criminal libel if he did. The
illegitimate (ex-nuptial) birth-rate of Aus-
tralia is not high. Of every 1000 unmarried
women aged between 15 and 45 there are,
on latest figures, 38 mothers per annum in
Hungary, 30 in Austria, 26 in Sweden, 24
in Denmark, 16 in France, 14 in Italy and
Spain, and only 12 in Australia. The
births within nine months of marriage cer-
tainly are excessive. Yet they and the ex-
nuptial births together number less than 40
p.c. of the total first births, and less than
13 p.c. of the total births.
An Australian railway record was put up
the other day when a fruit train left Wal-
langarra (Queensland border) for Albury,
en route for Melbourne, by way of Dubbo,
Parkes, Forbes and Stockinbingal. This is
the first time the long drag round by Sydney 7
has been dodged; and unless city interests
get in their fine work on railway rates, the
short cut will be regularly taken for the
carriage of perishables.
The opinion formed by many, when the
■Washington naval treaties were signed, that
the only real effect would be to democratise
sea-fighting, is buttressed by the rush that
has set in for the 10,000-ton cruiser—the
new unit of power. In a few years a
10,000-tonner will be the equal of a Hood,
and countries like Nicaragua may be owning
them.
The British Taxation Office scared intend-
ing visitors to the Exhibition by issuing a
circular a while ago suggesting that they
would probably meet a tax-collector. But
the position is really not so bad as they might
have thought. The fact is Somerset House
got tired of being diddled by people who,
though English and regarding England as
their home, spend sometimes more than six
months of the year in Paris and the South of
France or elsewhere. If an Australian or
his wife has a residence in England, and lives
there during any portion of the year, he will
in future (like the aforementioned English-
man ) be liable for tax; but if he has no
regular residence, then he will have to spend
at least six months in Britain to be liable.
And unless he becomes “ordinarily” resident,
he will be liable to pay tax only on the
amount of his remittances.
SLOGANS OF EMPIRE.
[FOR THE BULLEIN.]
“ ‘Australians,’ said Mr. MacDougall, ‘do not
realise the importance attaching to dinners and
luncheons. For instance, Australia House could
educate a Labor man to realise the importance of
Empire development by a series of luncheons.! ”
The Call of Empire waxes dull;
Too faint the echo of its fluting;
The common herd is fed up, full,
And time is ripe for substituting
A note more liable to please.
So heed McDougall’s aphorism,
Clear as the thunder of the seas:
Prog Placates Proletarianism.
Thus, if the bristly Bolshevik
Gniws furtively at Fat’s foundations,
Or lairls the crude compelling brick
At high Imperial aspirations,
Go easy on the iron hand;
Don’t knot the rope or swing the sabre.
Perpend: Wine Warms the Worker and
The Loyal Leader Lunches Labor.
What though the horny-handed swear
That over-bloated is the Nation,
While each Dominion, wide and fair,
Drags it still further to damnation?
We know the means to calm their fret,
How bellowing may be turned to bleating,
While meat is hot and wine is wet,
Empires Expand by ’Earty Eating.
The prospect that before us lies
Need call for little apprehension.
If friction ever should arise
A good square feed will ■ ease the tension.
Then shall we see, when, all elate,
We hop the last opposing hurdle,
A happy Empire, satiate,
Girt in a Gastronomic Girdle.

The latest C.S.R. accounts, made up to
March 31, add the last word to the chapter
of amazing events which followed the deci-
sion to re-vest the Fiji and Maoriland busi-
ness in the parent co. The short-lived sub-
sidiary had a glittering career. Formed in
1915, its capital was made up of 3£ millions
of 6 p.c. prefs., every share of which was
a bonus to C.S.R. shareholders, and a
quarter-million of ordinaries, paid for and
held by the parent, which had com-
plete control. Within nine years the 3£
millions of pref. capital had been “returned”
to the shareholders who had put in not a
penny of cash, and besides transferring assets
to give the parent 20s. in the £ in respect
of its quarter-million holding, sufficient was
left (1) to pay two cash bonuses, one of
£203,125 to Fiji and M.L. holders, and the
other of £325,000 to shareholders in the
parent co; (2) to provide £650,000 to make
the parent’s shares fully-paid to £2O; and
(3) to leave a final £L,625,000, which per-
mitted the parent co. to issue bonus scrip
equal to 50 p.c. oh paid capital inflated by
the £650,000 issued just previously. These
adjustments were not, however, the full mea-
sure of the harvest from the subsidiary, be-
cause, owing to the uncertain outlook in
Fiji, assets with a book value exceeding 2f
millions were on transfer protected by a
contingent depreciation reserve of £1,625,000,
and this has not been taken into account.
Summarised, this Fiji and Maoriland subsi-
diary with 3£ millions of paid capital gave
in the process of liquidation (1) £3,778,125
of cash to its own and the parent co.’s
shareholders, and (2) assets whose book
values have permitted the parent co. to
issue £2,275,000 of gift scrip; also (3) it
has Fiji assets said to be worth £1,625,000
more, but which are not taken credit for-
pending the solution of the Indian labor
problem.
Whatever may have been the intentions of
the directors when they floated the subsi-
diary in 1915, the masterly device has per-
mitted millions of cash to flow out to share-
holders in other than dividend form; and
notwithstanding that outflow of capital, div.
distributions were increased, as shown by
the introductory table, which combines the
operations of both cos. Even the parent in
1921, when coffers were overflowing, made
political and labor conditions in Queens-
land, which were alleged to discourage the
extension of operations, an excuse to return
£650,000 of its capital. To appreciate fully
the present position of the C.S.R. it is neces-
sary to go back only to 1908, since when no
call whatever has been made on shareholders.
First of all, here is the tally of shares :
1908-13 .. Parent co.’s bonus shares . . £825,000
1915 .. Bonus shares in subsidiary .. 3,250,000
1923 .. Bonus shares in parent from Fiji
liquidation . . . . 650,000
1924 .. Bonus shares in parent from Fiji
liquidation . . . . 1,625,000
Total bonus shares.. . . £6,350,000
1908 .. Cash-paid capital . . . . 2,425,000
Total scrip issued.. ..£8,775,000
Against that, scrip for the following amounts
was called in and. cashed
1921 . . Parent co £650,000
1921 .. Subsidiary c 0... .. 1,625,000
1923 ... Subsidiary c 0... .. 1,625,000
£3,900,000
The difference between the two totals
(£4,875,000) is the present paid capital.
Apart altogether from regular, consistently
handsome divs., the C.S.R. and its offspring
have given shareholders of 16 years’ stand-
ing £B6 10s. of cash for every £2O of scrip
then held —incidentally, the market price
was around £4O in previous years—and that
original £2O holding is now represented by
shares with a face value of £4O 4s. Id,, an
interest in general and specific reserves of
£lB 18s. 4d. and £l3 Bs. more in visible
contingency reserves which, all going well,
may prove to be actual reserves. Regard-
ing the replacement and depreciation re-
serves as accumulations of true profits, and
assuming the Fiji labor problem will be
solved satisfactorily, every £2O of scrip held
in 1908, besides having taken divs. at the
rate of 131 p.c. p.a. down to 1915 and ap-
proximately 18 p.c. p.a. for the next nine
years, and in addition had capital returns
in cash of £36 10s., is now backed by assels
which are given a book value of £72 10s. sd.
The following table shows how book values
expanded over two eight-year periods with-
out the introduction of any new capital (the
1916 figures combine the totals of the parent
and subsidiary cos.)

In no other purely industrial investment
in the Commonwealth have such fortunes
been won. The C.S.R.’s returns of capital
have been so big that many of its old share-
holders have been figuring how much they
owe the co. Nevertheless, director E. Yv.
Knox is still a champion leg-puller; at the
latest meeting he told shareholders:—
You will see that we have given much more
information than hitherto about the capital invested
in the various branches. Our object in doing this is
that all concerned may see how much money is used
in the business and thus ascertain whether the owners
thereof are receiving an undue return.
As the latest increase of the div. rate gives
20 p.c. on cash-paid capital, and as returns
of capital and cash bonuses, apart from divs.,
have amounted to £lB2 10s. for every £lOO of
cash-paid capital, such a statement is mere
camouflage. Plainly, the “owners” have
been paid off with a big bonus to boot.
Every penn’orth of the many millions of
assets now held by the C.S.R. represents so
much more than a fair thing which has been
squeezed from the consumer and the grower.
Of course, the management will claim that
it has been the just rewrnrd for having per-
fected milling and refining practice and for
winning the maximum value from by-pro-
ducts, which are very considerable items m
the business. The C.S.R.’s bonanzas, how-
ever, are due primarily to (1) the fact that
it is handling a low-priced commodity on
which a fraction of a penny per pound runs
into big figures, and (2) that for many years
it has been controlled by one of the shrewd-
est and most far-sighted managers that any
concern was ever blessed with. E. W. Knox
is a law unto himself, and neither the Courts
nor the numerous Royal Commissions ap-
pointed to inquire into sugar matters have
succeeded in shaking C.S.R. foundations.
Even admitting that the magnificent profits
have been won mostly from efficient manage-
ment, the co.’s records leave no doubt that
the comparatively few who have prospered
from C.S.R. operations have received far be-
yond a fair return for any service they gave
in financing the manufacture and distribu-
tion of a necessary commodity.
As to the future of the C.S.R. as an in-
vestment, it is too much to expect that the
huge undertaking can repeat, or, perhaps,
be permitted to repeat, the amazing perform-
ance of recent years. Nevertheless, at
£4,875,000 it is apparently only fairly-mod-
erately capitalised. Here are the assets:—

To what extent the £1,140,177 in a replace-
ment reserve should be taken into the calcu-
lations is known only to insiders with know-
ledge of the condition of the mills, etc. Any-
way, with that array of assets the C.S.R.,
which has always thrived in flood or drought,
would have to do very badly indeed if a
good rate of div. had to be denied share-
holders. Last year’s disclosed net profits
returned 13f p.c. on £4,875,000.

In October last Queensland decided, by a
majority of 88,879 in a poll of 375,503 effec-
tive votes, that the liquor trade should con-
tinue. So in their latest report the direc-
tors of this co. are a little more perky than
usual. They announce the purchase of the
Jubilee Hotel, in the Valley, and the Luck-
ona Hotel, Toowoomba, wliicli they “are
certain will prove very fine assets.”' Also,
they admit that the “Wild Cat’s” suspicions
that for some years surplus profits had been
socked away were justified:—
Although the sundry reserves and rest account in
the balance-sheet stand at £29,691, we think it only
right to say we are satisfied, as the result of a re-
valuation of certain of our assets, there is a sur-
plus of over £lOO,OOO on the item “freehold pro-
perties, machinery and plant, etc.”
How • much of that inner reserve has been
accumulated by over-providing for deprecia-
tion and contingencies, and what portion
has accrued from the. appreciation of pro-
perty values, are matters known only to
insiders. They are remarkable figures when it
is remembered that in 1915 paid capital was
doubled by a bonus issue, and that in 1920
the transfer of other reserves added a third
to capital at that date —making in » all
£222,222 of bonus capital added to £133,333
of scrip held early in 1915. Not all of these
additions, however, came out of surplus
profits: in the Queensland boom of a quarter
of a century back the co. borrowed heavily
to buy properties at inflated values and to
finance publicans, and after the crash paid
capital was written down from £187,500 to
£58,333. The reduction was too severe, and
when the northern State recovered, and Per-
kins and Co. bounded ahead (with the aid
later on of fresh cash-paid capital), the
written-down assets again appreciated in
value.
The disclosure of large internal reserves
should not be interpreted as a hint that an-
other gift-issue of shares is contemplated.
The past year’s div. was at the rate of only
7 p.c. p.a., and the average for the past four
years 6f p.c. ; and that certainly doesn’t
look as though the co. is ripe for any stock-
watering. Rather must the Perkins holder
regard the existence of large internal re-
serves as giving the investment more solidity
and, possibly, offering prospects of better
divs. But the mere disclosure of higher
capital values doesn’t earn more profit." A
lot depends on what you do with the pro-
perty. If a man owned the post-office block
and used it for grazing cows, his profit
wouldn’t be any more now when the block
might be worth a million than it was when
the land was worth perhaps a tenner. One
feature of Perkins’s recent expansion—three
hotel properties have been purchased in two
years—has been that, though liabilities have
become larger, the liquid surplus is still
bigger than it was five and ten years ago:—

Liquid surplus £102,359 £95,501 £175,292 £105,881
The balance-sheet position would be much
clearer if fixed and floating debts were stated
separately, and if also, on the other side,
trading accounts and advances were divided.
Anyway, the position is snug with £90,770
surplus of more or less liquid assets over
and above all liabilities and the final div.
payment.

The predecessor of this co., West’s Pictures,
Ltd., was one of the pioneers of movies in
Sydney, and about a dozen years ago it
joined the amalgamation of showmen in the
General Film Co. of Australasia, Ltd. In
that concern it took £86,534 of shares and
£10,456 of debentures and advanced £10,407.
These figures greatly exceeded the book
value of assets transferred; but when the
present co. took over, the value of the Film
holdings was discounted and £36,638 was
placed in a “capital reserve account.” This
reserve has since been increased to £37,888.
While the Film share and debenture in-
terests are practically unaltered, the advance
has been reduced to £4OOO. On its own
account the co. holds properties with a book
value of £40,425 and a £3OOO parcel of War
Loan, and has £17,500 of loans at call. Some
years ago theatre properties were reported
to have been “consistently earning sufficient
to provide almost 9 p.c. on capital,” but
subsequent returns were not nearly so
good. Better profits last year were wholly
due to the General Film having paid a larger
div., and the erratic course of figures in the
introductory table is accounted for by the
varying distributions from that concern. For
the past 12 months West’s showed 13| p.c.
on its paid capital, and as shareholders have
had 10 p.c. divs. there has been a substan-
tial addition to reserves. All of the £25,825
shown in the introductory table may not
be shareholders’ reserves: the published
balance-sheet divides it into £11,236 of “re-
venue reserves,” which are, perhaps, liable
to be drawn upon for renewals, and the
balance of £14,589 is held in a Profit and
Loss appropriation account. However, after
handsome rates of divs. had been paid in
the earlier years and an average of 8f p.c. for
the past quinquennium, the co.’s position
was easy. Here are balance-sheet compari-
sons going back to the beginning:—

Book debts and cash 5,797 10,947 16,212 21,295
Including the General Film debentures and
advances as liquid (but not the shares), at
March 31 West’s showed a surplus of £35,1h5
of liquid assets over and above liabilities
compared with an excess of £Bll6 of liabili-
ties at its first balance in 1913. Debts in
the latest accounts totalled only £5lO. The
values of properties have perhaps appreciated
in recent years, but unless the co. decided
to dispose of them, their earning capacity
and not their worth in the market counts
in appraising the investment value of scrip.

Elder’s Trustee Co. is only 14 years old,
and is making great strides. The excess of
new estates placed in its care over and above
dispersals for the past five years has been:
£336,054, £524,461, £712,832, £415,560,
£534,934. Aggregate book value of trusts
have made these rapid movements:—
1911 .. £53,562 1920 .. £3,553,763
1914 .. 1,463,454 1921 .. 4,078,224

1919 .. 3,217,709 1924 .. 5,741,550
The figures are the more remarkable because
at about the same time Elder-Smiths opened
this office, the Bagot, Shakes and Lewis
people also established a trustee co., and it
also is doing so well that 100,000 new £1
shares, to be called to 2s. 6d. each, were re-
cently issued. Meanwhile, the half-century-
old S. Aus. Executor, Trustee and Agency
Co., despite the competition of the two
strongly-backed youngsters, has also been
bounding ahead.
In its fourth year (1914) Elder’s won
£3737 of commissions and £B3O of interest
at a working cost of £2051; for the past 12
months commission earnings had soared to
£22,081 and £4833 came from investments,
and the management bill had increased tp
£18,154. Paid capital was doubled in the
1921 financial year, and on £40,000 latest
net profits did not fall far short of 20 p.c.
After paying 10 p.c. and voting £lOOO to a
staff fund, profits reserved represented 7.4
p.c. on capital. In 14 years shareholders
have had £26,800 of divs., and £22,792 of
surplus profits have accumulated. The co.’s
own funds (£62,792) give a handsome re-
turn on the £40,000 of capital, apart from
commission earnings: no less than £62,277
is invested in Commonwealth and State Gov-
ernment securities, and none is earning less
than 5 p.c. They are giving £3326 p.a.
(8.3 p.c. on capital). Incidentally, they
are the best class of assets a trustee co. can
hold as a guarantee of good faith and to
protect clients against faulty management.
Shareholders have also made themselves liable
for £160,000 more, the 200,000 £1 shares
having been called to only 4s. each.

The new British-made “NATIONAL” Vertical
Single Line Suction Gas Engines being installed at
Bathurst, Parkes and Dubbo, N.S.W., for generating
electric energy aggregate 1300 horse-power. The fuel
for these engines at Bathurst and Parkes will be
from local timber and at Dubbo from coke manu-
factured at the local gasworks. The sole agents,
Arthur Leplastrier and Co. Pty., Ltd., of Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, advise that alter-
nators direct coupled to these engines may be paral-
leled. The maximum cyclical variation of the larger
units should not exceed 1 in 1485, which is impossible
of accomplishment with any other type of engine
excepting high-speed steam engines, the fuel costs of
which, however, are excessive.— Advt.

AUSTRALIAN CONCESSIONAIRES:
14-
GUTHRIDGE LIMITED,
PARRAMATTA ROAD, CITY (Opp. St. John’s [University] College), SYDNEY.
Australian Gypsum shareholders have
approved of the directors’ proposal to in-
crease paid capital to £300,540 by the issue
of 180,324 £1 bonus shares, giving 24 fully-
paid shares for every one. The present capi-
tal, the directors say, “does not adequately
represent the real value of the assets of the
co.” This is not the co.’s first juggling with
gift shares: holdings were almost doubled in
a reconstruction in 1920. The plaster-
making industry is booming, and the new
shares are issued on the strength of nothing
more substantial than the prospects of the
boom continuing. Last year’s disclosed pro-
fits were £15,451, and the average for the
previous three £5254; so earnings will have
to show a big improvement to give reason-
able divs. on the inflated capital. However,
great things are expected of the new Treven-
ard (S.A.) factory.
* * * *
The Australasian interests of Brunner,
Mond and Co., Ltd., the big English chemical
co. (paid capital 13| millions), have been
taken over by Brunner, Mond and Co. (Aus-
tralasia) Pty., Ltd., registered in Melbourne,
but with headquarters in Sydney. Nominal
capital is £150,000, and the co. begins with
£49,750 paid up. The directors are Roscoe
Brunner, J. H. Gold, J. G. Nicholson and
F. P. Cruttenden (managing), the first three
being directors of the parent concern.

Westralian Mines Department has recently
been making advances to numerous parties
delving in old shows in the hope of effecting
resurrections. Fraser’s Central, one of the
earliest gold finds in the State, has been
granted a long-dated loan of £4500. It is
questionable whether any improvement of the
gold-mming industry can be expected from
a policy of throwing good money into out-
back waterholes; the money would be better
spent on encouraging the search for new
reefs and lodes.
The reduction of Kalgoorlie wages by
Is. 6d. per shift has not effected the savings
the mine-owners thought it would. The best
men are taking better-paid jobs with tribute
parties or are going elsewhere. Consequently
the standard of efficiency has fallen below
what it was before the award became opera-
tive, and the Chamber of Mines—though, of
course, it wouldn’t admit the fact —is sorry
it battled in the courts for the reduction.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe’s mainshaft is now down
below 3300 ft., and driving at 3020 ft. has
exposed 6ft. of 625. ore for a distance of
130 ft. With costs in the Boulder area ex-
ceeding 405., there cannot be much profit in
mining below 3000 ft. At first sight, 625. ore
looks good, but such items of expenditure
as mainshaft sinking, crosscutting, London
office upkeep, etc., which are not included in
working costs, whittle down the margin.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) proposes to sup-
plement its recent outlay of £70,000 on
plant, etc., by an expenditure of £15,000
more on equipment. The improvements pro-
posed are expected to enable the management
to win profits from the mine-average of
64dwt., and permit it to abandon the present
disastrous policy of pulling out only higher-
grade material.
Freney’s superintendent-geologist Talbot in
his latest report declares that the deeper the
bore on the Mt. Wynne area goes the more
liquid the oil becomes. This, Talbot
argues, justifies the belief that oil in larger
and perhaps payable quantities is present in
the strata lower down. Meanwhile share-
holders are waiting to hear what Dr. Wade
and Dr. Clapp think of prospects.
Gnow’s Nest (W.A.) is a quick-and-lively
concern. During a two years’ tenancy it
erected a plant and milled 20,000 tons for
£70,000. Now it has decided to give up.
The mine is opened up to a depth of 300 ft.;
values there are good, but the shoot is short
and the water heavy. The owners believe
that it is wiser to hold the profits won than
to spend them on seeking an improvement at
greater depth. The Brilliant Co. recently
took an option and sent an expert to examine
the show, but his opinion has not yet been
made known.
* * * *
A Perth crowd is giving the May Queen,
Southern Cross, another chance. This
show has been worked continuously for 16
years, but less than 1000 tons have been
mined from a narrow cross-vein. The pro-
blem is wholly one of tonnages, and the May
Queen has been another example of the folly
of rushing up plant on the strength of a
few hundred tons showing. Westralian gold-
fields are dotted with abandoned plants which
were installed before sufficient ore reserves
were sighted.
* # # #
King of Creation (W.A.) has for the pre-
sent ceased wasting its Adelaide-subscribed
cash on options that show no promise of
success. First there was the wretched affair
at Laverton, and more recently the White
Horseshoe, at Parker’s Range, 50 miles south
of Southern Cross. The latter show paid
when worked by a party, but never looked
anything but small for a co. Adelaide should
by now have learned that a lode must have
length, width and depth, besides values, to
be worth anything to a co. Recently two
directors made an inspection of the option,
and they promptly advised that it be aban-
doned.
Last year two Dalmatian prospectors
located a pocket containing £12,000 worth of
gold in Oroya Black Range East (W.A.).
A Perth co. was hastily floated to acquire the
show, but shareholders divided into two
camps, and costly litigation ensued. Finally,
the representatives of the litigious crowd re-
signed, and directors agreeable to both
parties were elected to the Board. How-
ever, by that time the mine had been mort-
gaged to the Dalmatians to secure an advance
of £5OO, and one of the terms of the deed
is that £3OO has to be expended in under-
ground work at the discretion of the mort-
gagees.
Westralia’s new Minister for Mines, Mick
Troy, is opposed to both idleness and greedi-
ness on the part of leaseholders. Already he
has refused one Perth syndicate further ex-
emption on a group of copper-gold blocks at
Ravensthorpe, and has given a local specu-
lator, who claims to have backing, a slice
of one of the Kimberley Petroleum Co.'s
Nor’-West oil areas, which, like several
others, is far too large for any one co. to
hold.
South Kalgurli (W.A.) has issued an-
other estimate of ore in sight. This time
195,000 tons are said to be visible: 111,000
tons are reckoned to go and 84,000
tons 7Jdwt. There are also 76,000 tons of
“partially visible” reserves, of which 12,000
tons are estimated to average 7Jdwt. and the
balance a ’weight less. The recoverable
value of the stone now treated is a shade
under 9dwt.
* * * *
Dorrie Doolette and his backers have re-
opened the Ajana lead-mines, Northampton
(W.A.). Assisted by a £l5OO loan from the
Mines Department, they propose to give the
show a thorough go. There is plenty of stuff
in sight to keep a small plant busy.
* * * #
Manager Jas. Hebbard has not succeeded
in extinguishing the B. H. Central mine
fire yet. Underground work is confined to
crosscuts on the 300 ft. and 500 ft. levels, and
efforts are being made to isolate the fire area
with water curtains. Churn drills on the
surface are putting down holes above the
fire, and three million gallons water per
week are going down them and the surface
cracks. The exhaust air from the Central
Extended shaft is becoming an increasing
annoyance to the town, and smoke, for
many months entirely absent, is coming up
the shaft.

The Yerranderie silver-lead field (N.S.W.)
is probably the most potential yet least
appreciated metalliferous district in the
southern half of Eastern Australia. Atten-
tion has lately been drawn once more to it
by the dividend-producing Silver Peak mine.
Though the latest development in that show
has proved very rich, the whole field has,
from time to time, revealed similar occur-
rences. For many years large incomes have
been won from the field, but, on account of
the peculiar semi-public features of the cos.
operating there, Sydney investors have
neglected the possibilities. Development in
the Silver Peak No. 6 level under the man-
agement of A. F. Mixner, produced in 14
months from one stope 20 tons silver, 1700
tons lead and 5620 z. gold. The actual length
of the ore lens was 135 ft. This development
emphasises that no section of the known
fissure ought to be neglected; but the forma-
tion must be developed on sound mining prin-
ciples based on an intelligent study of the
field. The Government officials have for
some time been busy on a detailed geological
survey, and that should serve to stimulate
interest in what is, to Sydney, practically
a local mining district.
* * * *
“Barwonite”: About 18 months ago I
stated the opinion of the majority of old
miners on Lightning Ridge opal field
(N.S.W.) that the site of the present work-
ings was merely the fringe of the main field,
which, prospecting indicated, was probably
further out towards Angledool and possibly
extended round to the vicinity of Cumborah
Springs. The Mines Department recently
granted a sum of £2OO for prospecting, and
a committee of business men, miners and
two Government officials has been appointed
to supervise the allocation of the funds.
* * * *
Carter’s Hill, Rockley (N.S.W.), has a
battery, but it is never mentioned in reports
nowadays, and no hint is given as to when
crushing is likely to be resumed. No. 2
winze has been taken down to 64ft. and
completed. The lode narrowed in the last
6ft. This, it is said, was due to “passing
through the upper lens of ore; but in the
bottom it was improving in width, making
into the second lens, and free gold was show-
ing.” The next move is to complete a drive
to connect the bottom of the two winzes
and “determine the right place for the main
hauling shaft,” and then go after further
stoping material. About actual values and
likely tonnages the fortnightly reports are
silent, yet two years ago the promoters talked
of the main reef averaging an ounce, with
a likely improvement of “anything up to
50z.”
Itiverina Collieries, after battling with
water troubles which necessitated putting in
powerful pumping plant, has hauled its first
parcel of coal. One lot has gone to the
Wangaratta woollen-mills and another to
Cocks’ Pioneer mine, Eldorado (Vic.), for
testing.
The scheme to amalgamate the leases at
the Peaks, near Cobar (N.S.W.), has been
abandoned. Despite the fair amount of
backing that came from the district, the
Alan Davis stable had no more success than
W. G. Gillett.
* * * *
The Tuliamba copper-mine, near Silver-
spur (Q.), would, with a better market, pro-
bably develop into something big. Gossan
outcrops are plentiful, but they all make
into copper, and the gossans are too low
in gold and silver to work. Eight shafts
have been sunk to shallow depths, and all
struck copper carbonates which should run
rich at water-level. Prospecting work is
being continued, and the latest shaft is on
a formation which gives promise of develop-
ing into a big lode.
Mt. Peter, on the fringe of the Cairns
(N.Q.) canefields, has just put 204 tons
through its 5-head battery for 325|0z. gold,
apart from sands. This show has struggled
along hand-to-mouth and has not had suffi-
cient capital for development. The reef
varies from a foot to 7ft. wide, and colors
show for a length of 700 ft. Where sunk
on values have improved from ’weights in
the brownstone to ounces in the sulphides.
The latest crushing came from a stope above
the 84ft. level. An effort will probably be
made to give manager Harry Petersen funds
with which to develop the show, and if it is
all it seems an up-to-date 10-head plant will
be put in.
A find of fine white talc has been made
a few r miles south of Brisbane. Very little
work has been done so far, but boring indi-
cates a large deposit, and where opened up
the material is free of grit.
# * * *
Irvinebank (N.Q.) is still winning tin
from the old Vulcan, but it is all coming
from upper levels, which must sooner or later
be exhausted. A few outside shows are pro-
ducing, but their total output is small.
The Wild Irishman and the Great North-
ern are still Herberton’s best tin-producers.
The Bradlaugh is on dead work, and the rest
of the shows are rather small affairs at
present.
Burnie (Tas.) has been excited over the
proposal to erect steelworks there to handle
the Hampshire ore. These deposits have
been purchased by the Tasmanian Iron and
Steel Pty., Ltd., a Melbourne concern which
is arranging preliminaries; and ,T. T. Wynne
and S. C. Swanson propose to seek capital
for the venture in London in July. Geo-
logist Mclntosh Reid has reported favor-
ably on the quality and quantities of ore
available; his samples went just under 68
p.c. metallic iron, traces only of sulphur and
phosphorus and 1J p.c. silica. Limestone
is available near by, and the promoters pro-
pose to draw upon the Hydro-Electric de-
partment for power. One of the problems
is the supply of coal, which may have to
be drawn from Newcastle.
* * * *
For the Colonial Exploration and Develop-
ment syndicate, of Melbourne, M. M. Stewart
has taken up an oil concession in ex-German
New Guinea, 50 miles from the Dutchman’s
boundary-fence. One area is certified as
being outside the earthquake region, and as
it has undulations, seepages, brine springs,
pleistocene, oligocene and miocene horizons,
with fossils ad lib., the venture is billed by
the promoters as one of the oil sensations
of the future.

Asam Kumbang, one of the newer Aus-
tralian tin-dredging cos. operating in
Malaya, has had a great run lately. A
month’s harvest of tons oxide from
97,000 yd.—the digging rate was reduced “on
account of high values in the ground treated”
—has been followed by a yield for a fort-
night of 451 tons from 49,000 yd. The six
weeks’ production was worth approximately
£21,500, and working costs have not taken
much more than one-seventh of that. A 2s.
div. payable on Monday next is to be accom-
panied by a bonus of 3s.

Some of the old-timers have hopes of a
mining revival in the wild mountain ravine
between Cromwell and Lake Wakatipu
(M.L.). Engineer lies, with some good work
already to his credit, has staked his reputation
that he can shut off the water now tearing
down through the Kawarau gorge by erecting
a barrage across the outlet of the lake and
damming back the water for 90 days every
winter. This would have the effect of so
lowering the river that miners could get at
the rich pockets of gold which are believed
to lie in the crevices and bed of the stream.
There are 25 miles of this natural tailrace,
and £lOOO has lately been paid for half-
mile claims. Some splendid patches were
won in the old “rush” days of the ’sixties.
Only last winter a fossicker struck a seam
in the schist at the water’s-edge and scraped
out 48oz. with a butcher’s knife.

"and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS"
“T.P.” : The little daughter of an eminent
Melbourne divine wrote the following story
for a children’s competition in one of the
weeklies. It didn’t win :
Chapter I.
At the marriage altar the brave knight clad in
shining armor stood with his bride dressed in white
as a token of purity. Her hair was long and golden,
and shone in the light which streamed through the
cathedral windows. The, knight was bold and tall,
with fire gleaming from his black eyes. In his right
hand he bore a silken banner with the words “For
love and purity and thee,” whilst his left clasped
his lovely bride.
Chapter 11.
Even as the holy priest, looking up at the roof
and blessing them, made them one, the blast, of a
war-trumpet shrilled the call to arms. The raven-
DOES MARRIAGE END ALL?
“They say he had a hard fight to win her.”
“Yes, but it’s nothing to the fight he has to keep her.”
haired knight dropped his newly-made bride strode
to the door, and spoke to the trumpeter, Waldemar
de Fitz Albert, why thus callest thou me from my
newly-made bride ?” Waldemar answered: 1 call
thee, for the Saracens ride across the raging main,
and thou and I alone must uphold the Sacred Gross.
The black-haired knight made reply: Be it so,
though my heart is fain to break!”
Chapter 111.
The golden-haired bride staggered lorth, and cast-
ing herself on her face before her husband moaned,
“Must it be, my own?” Raising her tenderly with
his left hand, for his right hand held his banner
and the reins of his coal-black champing steed,
groaned “Even so. I go to fight for love and purity
and thee.” The bride clasped him in her arms,
and tied her two white gloves on his helm of steel.
“Go,” she sobbed, “and I will also work and pray
at home for love and purity and thee. Choking
back his gasping sighs he flung himself on his steeu,
and galloped off to the field of gore.
Chapter IV.
For eight long years he fought for love ami
purity and her, whilst she did likewise for him,
and prayed also.
Chapter V.
It was midnight, and a thunderstorm raged as
the bride, now grown older, with her fair hair
hanging in glorious golden masses down her alabaster
back, sat in the moat of her castle. She was
stitching another banner of love and purity, when
a trumpet rang out and her loved pne clasped her
in his arms. He said, “I have fought for thee, and
now return to thee thy gloves pure as thou gavest
them me. I have done my duty She made
answer: “I for my part have worked at home tor
thee these eight long years, and also foi love and
innocence. I too have done my duty, and the result
I give unto thee.” And drawing a massive crimson
curtain aside she disclosed in rosy sleep m their
cots eight lovely babes.
[finis.]
“Simon”: A few lady doctors may have
acquired fair practices, but, generally speak-
ing, women can never be a success in the
medical profession, for the reason that they
won’t be let. Women themselves favor the
stronger and more confident masculine touch,
while men are the most shameless prudes.
The average man would run a mile ratliei
than bare his body for the stethoscope in a
woman’s hand. A few years ago a couple
of friendly societies united to bring a doctor
to a small western N.S.W. town, balary
was fixed, rights of private practice extended
and a medico (Dr. Harcourt) selected on
paper qualifications. Bill from the navvies
camp and a couple of other enterprising citi-
zens wore deputed to meet the appointee at
the station. They did, and gazed in a dazed
fashion at her skirt. It was Bill who put the
anti-feminist feeling into words. No mixeu
bathing up here,” he announced briefly; ana
she had to withdraw without unpacking.
* * *
“Morehead”: At Neilsen Park (Sydney),
the other night, a large ferryload ot dappers
and their swains got the shock ot tlieir young
lives. Beneath a banner that carried the
startling words “Young People. Bod is
Watching You !” stood a tall, bearded man.
He solemnly handed a small leaflet to each
girl as she passed him, and with an up-
raised finger drew notice to the _ warning
upon the strip of calico. Feminine curi-
osity over-ruled the habit of immediately
crumpling up and throwing away anything
in the religious-tract line, and scores of the
recipients read the leaflet when the fiist
lamp was reached. It consisted largely of a
denunciation of the duplicity of the honey-
tongued young man who escorts girls to out-
landish places at nights, was liberally punctu-
ated with more or less twisted quotations
from Proverbs, and closed with two awe-
inspiring passages from the final chapters ot
Revelation. It staggered most of the maids,
and several angry young m'en rushed back to
toss the whiskered moralist into the sea
to find that, after discharging his bolts, he
had boarded a Quay-bound ferry and was out
of reach of reprisals. # #
“Tu*Hawaiki” : Quite a lot of white men
were literally incorporated with the Maoris
m the bad old days
of cannibalism.
Robert McN a b,
who knows more
about the subject
than most, gives a
list of 91 known
cases of cannibal-
ism in which Euro-
peans figured on
the menu up to
and including the
Boyd massacre in
1809. The list is :
1642, Zeehan, 1;
1772, Marquis de
Castries, 11; Mas-
carin, 16; 1807,
Benus, 12; 1808,
Parramatta, 11;
1809, Boyd, 40. To
these have to be
added the nine men
of Furneaux’s crew
eaten in the
Sounds in 1773 and
various stray
beachcombers and
runaways who
were devoured.
And the Boyd was
by no means the
last case. Canni-
balism cropped up even as late as the Hau-
Hau outbreaks about 1870.
* *■ * *
“FY7”: The liability of Australians to
make a fuss over next to nothing was illus-
trated in a recent Melbourne case, wherein
a gentleman was actually tried for casually
drowning a lady friend. The pair were
guests at a “beer-barrel picnic” on the banks
of the Yarra. The male picnicker demanded
the sum of eighteen-pence, of which the lady
was bailee, threatening to drown her if she
refused. She did refuse, and was accord-
ingly dragged down the bank by the legs and
heaved into the willow-draped flood. The
picnic-party, taking a proper view of such
trifles, paid no attention to the incident,
regarding it as nothing more than high-
spirited exuberance; but when the woman
was fished out, as the result of a passing
stranger’s interference, it was found that
she was dead. A jury with nothing better
to do made it manslaughter, and a Judge,
busy earning his salary, said “six months.”
NOT GUILTY.
“Dearest, you cannot imagine the terrible temptations to which
the young men of this city are sometimes subjected.”
“Not by me, Albert! I swear that for years I have flirted with
none but married men.”
All over a miserable eighteen-pence—and a
dead woman !
“Hasen”: It must be a black cloud if
Brown can’t find a silver lining. I met
him bubbling over with joy the other miser-
able winter afternoon. “The straight griffin,
old son,” he explained; “Halty Lass at the
trots to-day. I’ve sent a fiver out for it.
Absolutely reliable tip—can’t lose barring
accidents.” And on he rattled in his light-
hearted, light-headed fashion. I was a little
surprised, though, I admit, to find him just
as lighthearted later in the day when the
stop-press of the evening papers had told a
waiting world that Halty Lass had finished
last but one in the Tradesmen’s Trot. I
suggested that he seemed to be bearing up
well under the blow. “Oh, well,” he said,
“it’s not so bad. You see, I was a bit wor-
ried this morning. I’ve got a dam’ rotten
conscience that won’t let me go on owing
people money. I’d just made up my mind
that I’d have to pay that 12 quid I owe
Wox*thington for fixing my teeth. But, hang
it, he can’t expect it for a month or two
after this, surely. He gave me the tip.” And
Brown and his conscience went off to a game
of billiards.

An old skipper remembers: —
The news that the s.s. Arawatta has been booked
for the scrapheap reminds me of a hectic race in
1890. The Arawatta, recently arrived from England,
had made one inter-State trip and claimed to be the
crackerjack ship on the coast. The paddle-wheeler
Newcastle had just completed a Melbourne-Launceston
charter and was returning to Sydney. The vessels,
crowded with chiacking passefigers, left Melbourne
together. Outside the Heads the sea was like a
millpond, and liquor began to flow freely. In
between burst of cheers and defiances hurled at the
Arawatta, the Newcastle passengers collected money'
from each other for the Bourke Flood Relief Fund,
and clambered down the stokehole ladder with booze
for the firemen. The clink of bottles smashing
under the paddles blended with the mellow clap-clap
of the floats. Muzzy deckhands sprawled over the
rail and offered ropes’ ends to the Arawatta. Off
Gabo the Newcastle had gained a couple of lengths.
Suddenly a howl of protest burst out: “The cows
are doublebanking her!” Someone had spotted an
extra watch of firemen sneaking into the Arawatta’s
stokehole. Hoarse passengers shook their fists at
the rival boat, tore off their coats and begged to be
allowed to shovel coal. At Green Cape we hal
gained another length. After that I recollect a
plume of steam escaping from each ship’s safety
valve, and two dazzling wakes stretching straight
as plumblines astern; so someone was keeping an
eye on the firing and steering. In the haze of

“G.R.” unrolls an Arctic map:—
No fewer than three flights to the North Pole are
imminent.- Amundsen, who failed last year, will
make his second attempt in a flying boat this time
from Spitzbergen to Alaska. Nansen, now over 60
and the biggest man in the history of Polar exploia-
tion, will try for the
same objective in a
machine fitted with
floats, which will en-
able him to alight on
any open lanes of water
which may be sighted.
Commander Boothby, the
colleague of Burney and
Britain’s foremost air-
ship enthusiast, is
arranging for a British
airship to make the
voyage from Pulharn
in Norfolk. One of the
ideas behind the British
plan is to give a fillip
to British airship con-
struction, but Amund-
sen and Nansen have a
more personal motive.
They have never been
able to swallow Peary’s
claim. Many other
authorities are equally
sceptical. In his last
book, Sir Clements
Markham refers t o
Peary’s “claim,” and
Scott and Shackleton
always maintained a
stony silence on the
subject. It is true
that the R.G.S. accep-
ted the statements, but
that was merely a
matter of traditional
British courtesy. As a
fact. Peary’s claim is
difficult to rebut, since
it is entirely founded
on negations. H e
sighted no land, ne
made but four sound-
ings, each with a nega-
tive result, he had no
white companions dur-
ing his final dash, and
he produced no maps.
What he did produce
was a picture of a snow
mound, with the Stars
and Stripes flying from
it, and a piece of
paper with a sum thereon the answer to which was
90 degrees north latitude. An equally convincing
picture could be produced in any studio, and Macau-
lay’s schoolboy could have done the sum.
“H.S.”: The old P. and O. liner China,
which has been condemned to the scrap-heap,
made more history than most in her time.
She is to blame for the Company’s ordi-
nance—more honored now in the breach than
the observance —forbidding officers below the
rank of skipper to fraternise with passen-

gers. A dance and champagne supper party,
given by a festive lady in the first saloon,
was said to have been responsible for the
wreck of the vessel at Perim over a quarter
of a century ago. Certain it is that all the
officers were invited, that most of them
attended, and that several were the worse
for wear when the ship struck. For months
she lay, a hideously bad advt. for her owners,
in view of all the Red Sea-Gulf of Aden
traffic. She was eventually got off, regardless
of cost, repaired and sent to sea again. She
served as a hospital ship in two wars (the
last and the Boxer affair, in China) and
was the cause of an “incident” in the Russ.-
Jap war that threatened to bring Britain in
•against Russia.

ENLIGHTENMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The daily paper is the great agent of enlighten-
ment.” —Remark in one of them.
Too right it is! if any dolt
In this enlightened age
Lacks knowledge how to loot and bolt
Or glut his brutish rage,
To cut a throat or smash a head
With masterly success,
And paint some quiet suburb red.
He cannot blame the press.
To swell the lexicon of gore
Is their incessant care,
And as the presses clash and roar
They seem to cry this prayer:
“Give us this day our daily blood,
Another crime appalling
To keep our output at the flood,
Our newsboys busy calling.
“Let there be light Delilahs still
And frenzied fools to shoot them,
A master-thief for every till,
Police and roughs to boot them.
“And let the gallows, nothing loath,
Take toll, that we may draw
Our livelihood alike from both
The lawless and the law.”
But bless their edifying way
I thought (what time I heard a
Shrill voice cry: “Latest trager day!”)
What’s home without a murder?

VIRGINIA CIGARETTES

20 for 1/0
ARDATH TOBACCO CO., LTD., LONDON .
“Centurion”: The fuss with Fritz brought
some quaint jobs into being, but the queerest
I heard of was that of O.C. Goats, held
by an Imperial A.S.C. officer at Havre.
These goats were the staple flesh-food of the
Indian troops before they were transferred
to jVlespot., and were brought by the thou-
sand from Southern France and Spain. The
O.C.G.’s sub-department had to muster and
deliver the beasts alive, for both Mohamme-
dan and Hindu did their own killing, and in
addition to routine worries the section had
to put up with unending ribaldry. The
surest way to rouse the O.C. to capricornian
anger was to ask him how many baa’s he
expected to get with his D.S.O. when the
war was over.
“Sturt” : A much-surprised man lias been
gaoled in Adelaide for threatening another
citizen with some unspecified “proceedings”
at law for “carrying on with” a lady, tem-
pered by a suggestion that the payment of
£5O would square the matter. The threat-
ened person very sensibly made an appoint-
ment to discuss things, and then had two
detectives hidden within hearing. The pri-
soner urged in court that his intention to-
wards the other had been merely “to give
him a good dressing down, and get a letter
of apology from him”; and that it was,
anyway, a case for the First Offenders Act.
But the Bench called it blackmail, “one of
the most despicable of all crimes,” with flog-
ging legally possible as part of the sentence,
and seemed to think it was letting him off
lightly with two years’ hard labor. A man
in England recently was given 12 years.

“Delver”: The Spit punt at Middle Harbor
is within measurable distance of being re-
placed by a low-level bridge, the first pile of
which was driven home the other day. In
the first recorded crossing of Middle Harbor,
a marine of H.M.S. Sirius and a sailor
played the star parts. It was on July 15,
1789, that John Hunter, returning from a
journey of exploration to Broken Bay, en-
deavored to take a short cut from Pitt Water
to Sydney. He expected to find little diffi-
culty in negotiating the “North-west Arm,”
as he called Middle Harbor; failing a native
canoe, the idea was to signal for a ship’s
boat to the Sirius, which lay in the cove
THE AGE OF JAZZ.
“Ha, Airs. Golightly, I should have liked you to have introduced
me to your husband last night at the church social .”
“That wasn’t me husband, sir—that was me darncin’ partner.”
that still bears her name. A canoe was
found, but “the first man to enter overset
her and was obliged to swim ashore.” The
next effort was with “a catamaran,” but,
“although of the lightest wood we could find,
it would not float one man.” The repeated
signals by musket fire to the Sirius going
unobserved, two men of the band volunteered
to swim across. It was a cold July, but the two
stripped, and tying their clothes on to their
heads took the water. Hunter gauged the
distance as four hundred yards and he evi-
dently put the clock on them, for he states in
his diary that the job took seven minutes —a
creditable performance. An hour after reach-
ing the shore, the pair were on the deck of

the Sirius. It was on the return journey
that the party found Peter White, sailmaker
of the Sirius, who had been lost in the bush
for four days. He was in a dying condition
when found somewhere in the vicinity of
what is now Spit Junction.

“Pilot”: “M.M.8.” claims that the bell
of the Samuel Plimsoll calls pupils to lessons
and meals at the C. of E. Girls’ Grammar
School, Geelong (B. 8/5/’24). It must be
the fo’castle bell, for the main poop bell is on
the bridge deck above the captain’s cabin on
the s.s. Themistocles —-it was bought by Capt.
Jermyn, and presented to the Aberdeen White
Star line.

“Herodot”: Neutral and semi-neutral
countries had obvious attractions for de-
serters during the war. When the Austra-
lians were in Egypt
Greece was the favo-
rite refuge for quitters,
and a small number
managed to reach
there. While the
A.I.F. w-as in France
the refuge was Spain.
Investigation disclosed
that there was a well-
organised “under-
ground railway,”
which arranged for the
transportation of run-
aways across the Py-
renees : the fare varied
according to the rank
of the deserter. Some
of these men returned
to Australia after the
proclamation of the
amnesty to deserters,
but not all. Less than
six months ago a tra-
velling Australian ran
across an ex-Digger in
Barcelona. The run-
away explained that
he had been an n.c.0.,
and that he had
cleared out because
one of the officers had
made things unplea-
sant for him. Accord-
ing to his own
account, the journey
across France to the
border had occupied
three weeks, travel-
ling being done by
night only ; he had been
one of a party of 10
deserters from the dif-
ferent allied forces.
He expressed a wish
to return to Australia,
but pointed out that he was handicapped by
a Spanish wife and a couple of children.
* * * *
“Whitehall’s” sociological item :
Lieut.-Colonel Elgood’s attack on the morals of
the A.I.F. is symptomatic. The Kipling gospel of
the essential superiority of the British Army faded
out. early in the World War. The best of the shock
troops were “colonials,” and some of the best of
their officers were clerks, shop-assistants and manual
workers—persons who would have been unthink-
able as leaders in battle at any time between 1066
and 1914. The spectacle was agonising to all but
the most intelligent and philosophic British regulars
(lan Hamilton belonged to this little group, by the
way), and in particular it rent the souls of regular
“dug-outs” such as Lieut.-Colonel Elgood. Hence
these tears about the moral infamies of the Anzacs,
and hence, too, the still-prevalent yarn about their
lack of discipline. Why troops without discipline
should have been chosen again and again for the
most difficult jobs, and how, unless their discipline
was of the best, they could have succeeded in such
jobs, are problems which admit of only one answer.
And yet the idiotic old slander persists. It is the
way a fairly common type of Service Britisher
“saves face.” Outside the services, and especially
in Australia, one actually finds Englishmen nowa-
days who are ready to deny their nationality. At
the end of a Sydney Domain harangue on a recent
Sunday the congregation broke up into small argu-
mentative groups. One of the most fluent of the
controversialists was a typical Birmingham artisan.
To the general stupefaction he claimed to be an
“Owssie.” “You’re no Ozzie,” said an elderly
woman, gazing penetratingly at his outsize bowler
hat — “Where’s yer good old Austrylian accent f”
This was the first sign I had met of pride in an
idiosyncrasy which it has been a local fashion to
deplore or deny. Apparently the tail of the kangaroo
is rising as definitely as the lion’s is sinking.
“Sierra”: A bulk with a history is the
Loch Katrine, which, after dozing for 14
years in the shadow of Dalgety’s wharf,
Sydney, is to take up a new possie at Rabaul.
First of the famous Loch line of clippers
to arrive in Australia, she reached Melbourne
in 1869, closely followed by the Loch Ness.
Before sailing from Glasgow, the boatswains
of the two vessels became involved in the
perennial sea argument whether a ship when
“in stays” (going about) is necessarily “in
irons.” Loch Katrine held that a vessel in
stays still carried headway and was under
control, whereas “in irons” meant that she
whs all aback and helpless. Loch Ness
maintained that the terms were synonymous
—-that a ship naturally got “in irons” every
time she went about. The controversi-
alists soon came to blows; they were sepa-
rated and placed aboard their respective
ships. Three months later, when the Loch
Ness hauled alongside Sandridge pier, her
bo’s’n rolled down the gangway and ap-
proached the Loch Katrine. “Now we’ll
settle that argument,” he roared, and com-
menced peeling off his heavy guernsey. The
Katrine’s bo’s’n hopped ashore while his
opponent’s head and arms were entangled in
the guernsey. “Yes,” he amended, “I’ll settle
it now, while you’re in irons.” And he did.

“Machete”: To complete “Cartot’s” ser-
mon on the hoodoo which the name “Aus-
tralia” carries for ships (B. 8/5/’24), let
me add to his list the predecessor in the
P. and O. of that liner Australia which was
wrecked at Port Phillip Heads. This older
Australia was a single-funnel, clipper-bowed
ship, with beautiful lines; her end came in
the Mediterranean early in the 1890’s. She
was the first of the P. and O. ships to be
lost by wreck.
* * * *
“Yacko” : Reference by “Zanthus” to the
slaughter of blacks in 1838 at Myall Creek
(B. S/5/’24) recalls that South Aus. has
a similar massacre to her discredit. In the
early years of her history the law was slow
in avenging the murders of white shepherds
on outlying stations on the west coast; so
settlers mustered the blacks —tradition says
there were over a hundred of them —and rode
or drove them over the cliffs of an inlet, ever
since known as Waterloo Bay. In the white
men’s defence it may be urged that they had
more provocation for their lawlessness than
the station-hands at Myall Creek, for the
S.A. pioneers suffered much from the abori-
gines, especially of the Port Lincoln and
Murray tribes. The greatest toll of white
lives taken by the blacks probably occurred
in 1840, at the Coorong, when the natives
massacred the crew and passengers of the
wrecked brig Maria, 26 in all.
“Blane” : Reports of “art” unions where the
profits are swallowed up by expenses recall
a highly successful affair at Ribemont in
March, 1917. Blighty leave came to Andy
with a pay-book seriously overdrawn. After
some hard thinking over the unpleasant in-
telligence he pulled himself together, and
the following dialogue ensued: “Lend us
50 ‘frogs,’ Corp. ” “Why pick on me,
Andy? A man ain’t John Bradbury.”
“Lend us 50 for half an hour. Square and
all; no longer.” “Righto, if it’s square and
all. Half an hour.” Andy soon had ten
members at five francs each in for his raffle
of a 50-franc note. He returned the cor-
poral’s loan inside schedule time, and took
back the price of a ticket from that agree-
ably surprised person before extending his
operations. No advertising was necessary,
for the news of “Andy’s raffling a 50-franc
note” was soon broadcasted among the four
companies. After booking his 120th subscriber
and finding business slackening, Andy wrote
“Foolly Suscride” on his list, and asked
the platoon corporals to do the drawing.
Result: Total subscriptions, 600 fr. Ex-
penses, nil. Cost of prize, 50fr. Profit,
550 francs. And nobody suggested that the
raffle wasn’t absolutely “square and all.”

“Tu Hawaiki”: Captain Cook, often a
little wooden in his choice of names as
“J.H.M.A.” points out (B. l/5/’24), has
enlivened geography with at least one pun.
He named Cape Brett, on the N.E. coast of
the North Island (Maoriland), after Sir
Piercey Brett. He did so, as he records in
his log, because near by there was a rock
with a hole pierced through it. “This,” says
Cook brightly, “was one reason why I gave
the Cape the above name, because Piercey
seemed very proper for that of the island.”
HE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT.
“May I sec Mrs. Snoofskiffs?”
“I am very sorry, sir, but she has the tooth-
ache."
“Yes, yes, I know. I’m just bringing them
hack. I am the dentist.”
“D.0.D.”: It was in a crowded Trak-
motor oscillating between Melbourne and
Elsternwick. Standing space was occupied
to the dizzy limit, when suddenly the little
man with the flame-colored moustache ad-
dressed the large Britannic matron strap-
hanging right against him with an icy:
“Madam, you can take your hand out of
that. I never carry valuables in my trousers
pocket.” The large matron resented the
insulting imputation by nearly shaking the
satiric person’s head from his shoulders.
And the worst of it all was that by this
time the real culprit had stepped off the ’bus
with the loot.
AUTUMN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though Spring has shed its green and gold,
Though summer’s blooms be flown,
The russet hues of autumn hold
A glory of their own.
No longer best is Spring’s green gold
When youthful zest has flown;
For russet hues in autumn hold
A glory of their own.

LYSTER O RMSBY, art connoisseur, of
Tyrrell's, Sydney.
Saturday, May 17, was the centenary of
the N.S.W. Supreme Court. The opening
ceremony was performed by Chief Justice
Forbes. A son of his became a District Court
Judge, and there is a grandson—a son of
the D.C. Judge—on the roll of N. S. Wales
solicitors.
Wing-Commander Stanley James Goble,
who has just flown around Australia, won
a commission in the Royal Naval Air Ser-
vice early in the war, and later on bagged
a D.S.C.—a much-prized naval decoration—
for engaging two enemy ’planes near Ghis-
telles, bringing one down and driving the
other off. In addition, lie received the
D. 5.0., the 0.8. E. and the Croix de Guerre.
His wife was a Miss Wodehouse, daughter
of a distinguished Indian civil servant and
a. scion of the Kimberley peerage. Next
year the Gobles are going to England, where
he will probably rise high in the Royal Air
Force.
Captain G. F. Hyde, second member of
the Australian Naval Board, is to take the
bridge of a British cruiser on the China sta-
tion next month. Priminister Bruce is under-
stood to have arranged the loan of the
brilliant Australian when in London. Hyde,
who specialises in strategy, was the acting-
head of the Government’s naval advisers be-
fore Admiral Hall Thompson took over, and
with luck and health should win flag-rank
before long.
George Melrose, dead in Adelaide at 68,
was one of a famous S. Aus. pastoralist
family, and had his headquarters at Mount
Pleasant, between the city and the Murray.
For years he was a director of the Elder,
Smith Co., and was in demand as a judge
of stock _at shows; but otherwise he took
no part in public life, preferring the study
of philosophy and the higher literature in
the bachelor seclusion of his library. The
surviving Melrose brothers are Robert, of
S.A. Leg. Council; Alec, lawyer and play-
wright ; and John.
In the banking world of the Common-
wealth no less than five general managers are
South Australians : Oscar Lines, of the N. S.
.Wales; E. H. Wreford, of the National;
C. W. Wren, of the Scottish ; R. S. Young,
of the Adelaide ; and R. L. Herbert, of the
Western Australian.
The death of Major-General Townshend
recalls one of the most discreditable episodes
of the war from the British standpoint. His
reputation was ruined, and nearly 5000
casualties were sustained in the neighbor-
hood of Kut-cl-Amara, chiefly through the
ineptitude of the “heads” in India. Sup-
plies were Hot forthcoming when they were
most needed, and about half of the deaths
in his force occurred owing to rotten hospital
organisation. The report on the. affair
caused the removal of Lord Hardinge from
his job as Viceroy of India in 1916. The
best Townshend could do for himself was
to write an apologia, which he called “My
Mesopotamia Campaign.”
“Sierra”: If explorer Stefansson visits
the Hay district (N.S.W.) he may meet an
old acquaintance, Robert Templeman, now
cooking at Canoon station. Templeman was
cook of Stefansson"s flagship Karluk in the
1913 Arctic Expedition. The vessel sank in
January, 1914, after being ice-crushed, and
the crew had an eight weeks’ tramp over
floating ice to Wrangel Island. There they
split up into camping parties of three, while
Capt. Bartlett and one Eskimo set out
across the ice to Siberia for assistance.
Templeman’s two mates, Mamen and Mal-
lock, died at Rodger’s Harbor Camp, and
he remained alone there for a considerable
time. He was within coo-ee of his last gasp
when the rescue ship hove in sight.
Pearson Chinnery, the Papuan anthropo-
logist, who, under various pen-names, has
provided The Bulletin with many interest-
ing New Guinea Aboriginalities, has been
appointed chief anthropological officer in ex-
German New Guinea. “Chin” knows a good
deal of New Guinea, but he will break fresh
ground when, backed by a few native police,
he interviews the wild man in his lair. He
will radiate from Rabaul, where his wife and
family will be located.
Among those heading towards Wembley
are three of the most prominent Fijian
chiefs, all descendants of the big men who
were signatories to the Deed of Cession.
Ilatu Joni Rabici, 0.8. E., lives in a fine
English house, keeps a yacht and generally
follows the example of the Briton who has
enough money to get one. Ratu Bengamin
Veli also has a fine residence in the Euro-
pean style, but spends most of his time in
a native house in the village where he was
born. He has been a considerable traveller.
And Ratu Joseva Sukuna, whom The Bul-
letin has mentioned admiringly before, is
a B.A. of Oxford, a barrister of the Middle
Temple, an ex-soldier in the Great War, and
a man of affairs in the Fijian civil service.
“L.G.” (London) : Michael Terry, a young
Englishman who was in the public eye on
account of his motor trip across nor’-west
Australia last year, has commenced a series
of illustrated lectures in England. His first
audience was at the Overseas Club on April
14 with W.A. Agent-General Colebatch in
the chair. Terry, who served in Russia while
still in his teens, is receiving a certain
amount of support from Locker Lampson,
M.P., who was his then commanding officer.
He is a good propagandist for Australia, and
hopes to return before Christmas to make
another trip across the Nor’-West.
Priminister Bruce hauled his Cabinet out
to Shipley House, South Yarra, to meet
while he was suffering from a cold the other
day. Twenty-four years ago Allan McLean,
then Premier of Vic., when similarly laid
up, had a Cabinet meeting at the pub at
which he was staying in Beaconsfield-parade,
Albert Park. Irvine (Attorney-General),
Watt (P.M.G.), Jimmy McColl and A. R.
Outtrim are the only survivors of those who
attended.
Octogenarian C. A. Topp, who is resign-
ing from the Vic. Indeterminate Sentences
Board, was a police inspector away back
in the ’seventies, chairman of the Public
Health Board in 1890, then head of the Chief
Sec.’s Department, and later Public Service
Commissioner. Not desiring to rust out
when he retired on a pension of £666, he
accepted a seat on the Indeterminate Sen-
tences Board with Sam Mauger and W. R.
Anderson ; but travelling in cold weather has
become a bit too severe on the veteran.
“0.P.H.” rebukes the Kirk:—
If the Vic. Assembly of the Kirk had been
game enough to adopt the virile protest against
Sawbath tea-and-tennis parties at State Government
House in the form in which the Sunbury meenister
submitted it, Earl Stradbroke would have respected
it; but what could he think of the verbose, apolo-
getic, fawning sort of thing that was ultimately
agreed to ? Either a protest was called for or it
wasn’t. Remember the old story? When a station-
master was bold enough to pull a cigar out of
Palmerston’s mouth and throw it away after he had
disregarded an order to cease smoking on the plat-
form, the Priminister respected him; but when the
railwayman, after learning that the offender was a
somebody, ran after him and fawned on him, “Old
Pam” let him know that he felt like kicking him,
“Lexite” : The influence of “P'addy” Mina*
han was given a mention even in the applh
cation of the _ Criterion Theatre proprietors
for an injunction restraining the Sydney City
Council from proceeding with the Park-
street resumptions for widening purposes.
Min ah an Brothers’ retail shop is a couple
of doors from Park-street in Pitt-street. A
suggestion of partiality was made in the
application for an injunction, one of the
grounds being that the resumption notice
did not include the lands referred to in
the [City Council’s] minute as being the pro-
perty of Minahan Bros.” The City Council’s
retort was that Minahan Brothers’ property
had at first been included, but was left out
m view of certain judgments given in regard
to the Martin-place resumptions. Still, how-
ever it happened, the Minahan good luck
seems to be very much in evidence.
Te Pana” : Heaton Rhodes, whose retire-
ment from Massey’s Cabinet is being dis-
cussed, affects the garb of Bond-street, and
wears a rosebud in his buttonhole. “Hm —
ha —er” is his regular prefix to a speech.
It punctuates the ora-
tion every two min-
utes, and is the most
definite thing in a
maze of culchawed
words. He is one of
the Canterbury
Rhodeses who have
made a fortune out of
mutton on the hoof.
Another member of
the family, Tahu, mar-
ried Eileen Plunket,
daughter of the lord-
ling who governed the

for many years
editor of the Adelaide
Register, now leaving
on another European
voyage of discovery.
The death in Melbourne of ex-Trooper
Fitzpatrick, who played a big part in the
1 suppression of the Kellys over 40 years ago,
recalls that another star actor in the drama
is still alive and well. It was Bishop Gibney,
of Perth, then a priest at Glenrowan, who
' crossed the open into the building where
the gang was making its last stand to plead
fruitlessly with Dan Kelly. He was the last
: to see the bushranger alive.
Robert Thompson, of Quorn (S.A.), must
be about Australia’s champion long-distance
Mayor. He has held the job for 23 years,
and as he is only 64 now he ought to be good
for a few 7 more years yet. Meantime he is
taking a trip to his native Scotland, which
he left wdien he was 19, and will look in at
the Empire Exhibition on his way.
“Jacaranda”: Robert Lawlor, after pros-
pecting, copper-gouging and kangaroo-shoot-
ing in the vicinity of Mount Isa (N.Q.) for
over 10 years, was fortunate enough to peg
out some of the richest leases, and then
cheerfully gave away two of them—valued
later at £lO,OOO each for option purposes.
Eawlor claims that he traded one of them,
the Even Break, for a bullock-hide which he
never got. When prospecting on one of the
leases Lawlor found some crystals resembling
white quartz which assayed 80 and 90 p.c.
load and 60oz. silver. Desiring a clean
place to put this rich ore, Lawlor considered
that a bullock-hide pegged out would just
suit him, and he accordingly gave the IQven

materialised. Dawlor still holds large in- ;

“U.P.”: S. Aus. lost a fine abo. the other
day when Alfred Hughes died at the Point
Pearce Mission. Ever since he left the
wurlies of his parents as a small boy he had
made his home at the mission, where he
was trained in the school and in farm work,
and he was often left in charge of the sta-
tion. Besides being the peacemaker among
his people, he encouraged industry among
them, and worked hard as a good example.
At shearing time he went into the sheds,
and was known as a quick and efficient
barber. His end came at 57.

tical note, he hopes to be present at a Euchaf-
istic Conference at Amsterdam.
“Spenner”: John Llewellyn Eugh may
have been the youngest soldier in the War
(B. 8/5/’24). But a young Canadian
machine-gunner, who was with me in
Chichester Military Hospital in July, ’l6.
had put in 15 months' active service and
four months of hospital before he celebrated
his 15th birthday. A proud mother who
had followed the young runaway as far as
Blighty vouched for his age.
A bad bargain for the State was made
when it was decided to give Michael Rear-
don £1 a week for life because a stray bullet
from a police rifle entered his shoulder when
the final attack was being made on the Kelly
gang of bushrangers at Mrs. Jones’s pub,
Glenrowan (Vic.). Reardon was a youth of
16, and his dad, a railway employee, would
have been glad to take as compensation any-
thing up to £5OO. From June 28, 1880, the
date of the injury, till the present Mick
has drawn close on £2300. Mrs Kennedy,
widow of Sergeant Kennedy, one of the three
J. Hops shot by the gang in the Wombat
Ranges in 1878, still draws her pension.
Roderick Charleston, just dead at Kerang
(Vic.), aged 95, was said to have been an-
other of the Diggers who fought at Eureka
Stockade. He arrived in Victoria in 1848,
and was certainly among the earliest on the
Ballarat and Bendigo fields. Nearly 50
years ago he settled near Lake Bael Bael,
in the Wimmera, and helped to pioneer the
mallee country.
Dr. Norman Haire—Sydney used to know
him as Norman Zions —who has been figur-
ing in the birth-control cables lately, was
connected with the Royal Hospital for
Women and the South Sydney Hospital be-
fore he headed for London and Harley-street.
He was a capable amateur actor, and one
of his last appearances here was with the
North Sydney District Comedy Club in “One
Summer’s Day.”
A Sydney family of Stewarts, having its

generation there is already one family of
eight and another of seven—and lots of time
ahead.

Cor 30 years a Labor M.P. in Vic., arrived
at the threescore years and ten the other

THE BIG THREE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the Presbyterian Assembly in Melbourne, the
Moderator-General (Dr. Mathew) hotly declared that
neither John Knox, John Calvin nor the Apostle
, h ave supported the motion of censure on
the State Governor for holding a reception and a
tennis party on Sunday.”
Said Calvin’s ghost to Knox’s shade:
“Do you remember, John,
The terms in which we flailed and flayed
The folk who shied at church parade
B’our hundred years agone?
We pilloried no deadlier sin
At Edinburgh or Venice ;
But tempora mutantur, eh?
Disquiet no more we twain display
To learn a Melbourne Sabbath Day
May taper off with tennis.
And lo! here comes another Saint
His acquiescence purring.
'Tis Paul—God bless me if it ain’t!—
Our mentor Paul, concurring.”
'Quoth Knox’s ghost to Calvin’s shade:
“In lands where blooms the thistle
I preached that feckless loons would roast
In Hell’s recesses nethermost
Who dared as much as whistle
Upon the day when kirks should fill.
But, brother, that, ye ken, is
Ho reason I should reprobate
The satrap of a sovereign State
Who Sabbaths seeks to recreate
With tea and tarts and tennis.
For times must change, ’tis understood,
And sins that once were slurring
Are venial now. It does me good
To hear old Paul concurring.”
Said Calvin’s ghost to Knox’s shade:
“Four-century-old criterions
For tougher congregations made
Were hardly meant to be obeyed
By modern Presbyterians.
Could we return to earth anew
Ere Conf’rence’s disbandment,
What Dr. Mathew says is true,
Progressive souls like me and you
Would take a more elastic view
About; the Fourth Commandment.”
He ceased. The motion passed, ’tis clear,
With neither John demurring.
A faint corroborative cheer,
Wafted from that Elysian sphere,
Was doubtless Paul concurring.

BARNES - LINSEED OIL
“Gouger” : The other day my mate and I
came across a blackfellow’s grave, with a cairn at
the head and several large, flat slate-stones lying
towards the feet. On these latter were groups of
milky-white quartz pebbles whose designs plainly
held some meaning. We bribed an old nigger to
read the riddle. He was greatly excited and declared
that the grave was no grave at all, but a “writing”
put there to indicate a blackfellow’s find of a rich
gold reef in the days when the early miners swarmed
this part of the country (Coramba, N.S.W. North
Coast). It appears that several local residents had
supplied the niggers with tucker for 12 months to
search for this legendary letter of a vanished tribe.
The old buck read the quartz symbols in this fashion:
“Walk alonga early sun. By-em-bye come big black
tree longa plenty dead tree. AValk longa shadow big
black tree by-em-bye come creek. Plenty gold longa
big-feller white-feller stone!” We followed these'
directions, and two hours’ walking brought us to
a 2 ft. quartz reef exposed in a creek washaway by
a long-forgotten flood. The reef was literally aglitter
with gold—newchum’s gold. It is the prettiest
mundic reef I have ever seen. Still for the first time
I was certain that an odd abo. tribe can really
correspond to some extent by. means of symbols.
* * * *
“Skyrider”: For years I had believed the
old story about wild magpies having a dislike for
their tamed brethren ; in fact, I had seen the latter
attacked by their bush brothers. Recently a tame
mag. strolled into my garden and found the grub
so good that he decided to stay. A day or two
later two wild ones flew into the yard and had a
conversation with Jack, who seemed glad to meet
someone from the old home. The newcomers were
introduced to a patch of land I had broken up
during the week-end, and next day they came along
when I was depositing some raw meat on a stump
for the pet. The ration was divided into three
without any squabbling, and since then 1 have had
three boarders. I must say that I get well paid for
the extra outlay. Every morning the untamed
beauties give a number of selections in the trees
at the back of my house, and if there is any sweeter
music than the carol of the magpie I have yet to
hear it. Yes, I have heard the nightingale.
“Swiss”: Re “C. Coral” (B. 24/4/’24)
and the Torres Strait islanders’ old practice of
keeping corpses in the house for quite a long time
on the way towards mummification. This habit
was not confined to dusky and disconsolate widows.
Towards the fag end of last century there lived on
Yorke Island a hard old sea-dog known as Yankee
Ned, who kept suspended above his bunk the mortal
remains of his native wife, Quinine —better known as
Queen Anne. Ned must ere now have joined the
mummy class himself, but in those days his one wish
was to visit his native Baltimore (which place lie
was said to have quitted because he found the
atmosphere growing a bit thick) to see if his sister
Hannah was still above ground.
* * *
“Ringtail”: I struck a
weird performance at a tank-
sinkers’ camp one afternoon. Just
in front of the tents was a dead
horse and when I arrived a man
was hitching another horse on to
drag the body to a freshly-dug
grave about 300 yards away. The
next moment I thought I had
landed on a bush tragedy, for
from a tent walked two men, one
with rope harness on, and they
went to an object near the dead
horse which I had not noticed
before but which I could now
see clearly was a man, apparently
sewn up in a bag with his bluchers
and part of his legs showing. The
man in harness was hitched on to
the recumbent one’s ankles and
started to drag him at the same
moment that the horse commenced
to haul the dead prad. About
half-way to the grave the horse
stopped in spite of the whip crack-
ing and bad language of the
drivers ; but the man pulled his
burden about 10 paces further on
before coming to a standstill. The
chap in the bag was then cut out
and he shook hands with the
fellow who had pulled him, after
which the pair threw up their
hats evidently in great glee. There-
upon I made some inquiries and
found that there had been an
argument as to whether a man or
a horse was the stronger at their
weights.
“F.”: The meanest man has been un-
earthed, and he lives within a hundred miles of
Sydney. He found a neighbor’s young bull astray on
the road, ran him into his yard as company for his
cow, who was showing signs of loneliness, kept him
for a couple of days, and then—sent for the inspector
to have him impounded as a trespasser.
* # * *
“Colub”: A curious and little-known Aus-
tralian lizard is the scale-foot, classified scientifically
as Pygopus lepidopus. It attains a length of from
two to three feet and is of about the same circum-
ference as an ordinary brown or black snake. It
has no forelegs and its hind limbs are merely a
pair of curious flaps, consisting actually of enlarged
scales attached in exactly the same way as are the
other scales with which it is covered. By means of
them it is able to move about with a slow and
curious dragging motion, its lack of speed placing
it absolutely at the mercy of its enemies—usually
large birds. Because of its habit of folding these
posterior flaps hard against its body when it is
not in motion the scale-foot has the exact appearance
of a snake, and has often been quickly and vigorously
dealt with as such. Once it was encountered fairly
often in Eastern Australia, hut nowadays it is seldom
seen, although it is still plentiful in many parts
of Tasmania. Some bushmen have a firm but
quite unfounded belief that its saliva is venomous,
and that if one is bitten by the reptile and any of
this secretion gets into the wound, the victim’s
death will follow in exactly the same way as if
he had been bitten by a poisonous snake.
MAKING A MARTYR OF HIMSELF.
“Ah, my brother, the pleasure of self-denial is the best pleasure
of all.”
“Righto, missus; then I’ll let you have it all and »o without it
meself.”
“Dr. Nil”: “Hayband’s” par. (B. l/5/’24)
recalls a one-legged groom and boy-of-all-work I
had many years ago in the horse-driving days. The
missing limb had been amputated at the hip joint
when he was a child, and he used only one crutch,
made by himself out of a hayfork handle. He never
went out of the front gate on foot, but vaulted
over the yard-wall—nearly sft; high—using his
crutch for a “pole.” He took the wall in his stride,
the crutchhead under his arm. He rode a bicycle
or a horse as well as I did. Once a pair of ponies
bolted out of town and along a sandy scrub road.
The lad jumped on his bicycle and chased them for
about two miles, caught and drove them back, with
the bike and his crutch in the buggy.
* * * *
“Phil Harum”: “Yarrum’s” dog (B.
l/5/’24) has a living rival in the Parkes (N.S.W.)
district. Bobbie is a combination of pug and
terrier, less than 18 months old, and during the
snake season just closed he accounted for 20 wrigglers.
He has been bitten a number of times, but is still
going strong. Generally to make sure that his
victim is dead Bobbie chews the snake’s head to
a pulp. After that, like “Yarrum’s” tyke, he makes
for the nearest waterhole, has a bath and comes
out as fit as a fiddle.
* * * *
“Chant Pagan”: Apropos of big heights of
maize, cane, etc. (B. 3/4/’24), has any member of
the Council ever kept time records of growth ? Here
are my entries. In Brazil I once measured a sticic
of cane to grow 6in. in the 24 hours and a stalk
of maize to grow loin, in the same time. Here in
Maoriland this year I kept tab on a stalk of bracken
fern to grow 9ft. 3in. in six weeks, and a frond of
“punga” (tree-fern) to unroll 6ft. 3in. in 7$ days.
Also I remember a 40-acre paddock of rape, put
down for fattening lambs, to grow higher than the
head of a big man riding through, it on a tall
horse in one day less than 13 weeks. The stalks
were over 4in. in diameter, and the crop was no good
for its purpose, but had to be crushed with cattle.
* * * *
“Calixto M.” : There are not many true
fish yarns like this one. A brown trout, a 26-pounder,
was recently caught in a tree near Lake Taupo
(M.L.). A deluge resulted in the sudden flooding
of a stream, and the waters subsiding very quickly,
the 26-pounder was among those caught napping in
the ti-tree scrub.
“S.C.”: A while ago certain of the beaches
on the far south coast of N. S. Wales were found
thickly strewn with young leatherjackets from
about three to five inches in length, while others, still
alive, were tossing helplessly in the surf. Those I
examined were of the yellow (or Chinaman) variety,
though the orange-spotted leatherjacket is commonest
in this quarter. The derelicts bore no marks of
injury. The little fishes were so plentiful that even
the pigeon gulls, who are not particular as to diet,
got fed-up with them, and the majority lay desiccating
in the sun untouched. Leatherjackets travel at times
in enormous shoals, and these may have been portion
of a school attacked by porpoises (dolphins) and
driven ashore. Or they may have died of sheer
starvation—as so large a number would need a great
amount of food. Diseases never, I think, affect fishes
wholesale, and these were perfectly fresh and healthy
looking.
# * * *
“Delver”: “R.G.’s” old-man kangaroo
which measured lift. 2in. from neck to tip of tail
(B. 10/4/’24) is sin. shorter than the one shot by
Surveyor James Evens at Cootamundra (N.S.W.)
in 1875. That patri-
arch weighed 2071 b., to
which the rudder con-
tributed 22£lb. Inci-
dentally, the first ’roo
caught by the first
settlers in 1789 was
no midget. He weighed
over 1801 b. and hi 3
tip-to-tip measurement
was over 10ft. This
particular hopper was
the first marsupial emi-
grant from Australia,
and he lived in the
London Zoo for some
time, becoming
thoroughly domesti-
cated and playful.
According to diaries of
the time, he and his
keeper amused many an
audience by their
“playful fighting.” Jn
August, 1877, a drive
at Trunkey (N.S.W.)
was responsible for the
slaughter of 8000 ’roos.
In this batch there
were known to have
been some giants, and
one report of the affair
stated that in old gent,
was measured and his
extremes were 13ft.
some inches apart.
“Moe” : In some
parts of Dutch New
Guinea, notably in the
Humboldt Bay district,
there is a curious local
variant of the age-old
trial by ordeal. The
accused has to drink
about a pint of liquid
brewed from a herb
which possesses strongly
emetic properties; if the system responds in the
usual way, he is adjudged guilty, but if he can
keep the stuff down (which not one in a hundred do)
it is taken as proof of innocence. Another local
ordeal requires a lighted firestick to be held in
the hand for several minutes; absence of burns
ensures a verdict of “not guilty.” I have been told
by Europeans who were eye-witnesses of natives hold-
ing lighted brands in their palms for several minutes
without having the slightest sign of a burn to show.
The explanation seems to be that the skin is previ-
ously treated in some manner.
* * * *
“Sucre” : You can make a snake interested
and indifferent to danger by merely dropping some-
thing in front of him. At Blackall (N.Q.) I saw
a mounted abo. suddenly rein in, drop his battered
felt a few feet in front of a black wriggler, aird
then ride 50 yards away to a clump of bushes for
a waddy. The reptile was still gazing at the hat
when he returned, and whatever curiosity did to the
cat it was certainly the death of that snake.
HEARTLESS BEHAVIOR.
GEORGIE (bursting in on the family) : “Otc-
wow! Agnes has gone and drownded all
Chutney's kittens. An’ didn’ leave me
even a single one to drown myself. An’
it’s my birthday too!”
“Gagi”: “Yarrum” tells of his dog running
to water when snakebitten (B. l/5/’24). Did
“Yarrum” notice what the tyke did there? A mate
and I, tracking towards a mud-creek in northern
N.S.W., were once passed by a gin travelling “all
out.” We caught up to her at the stream and found
her gulping down mud. When well enough she
explained that this was her favorite cure for snake-
bite. It was certainly a violent emetic. ,

WHEN AUNTY SAL WENT TO THE BALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Since Aunty Sally used to dance
’Tis five and thirty years or so—
How well she still remembers it
Although it was so long ago.
Our Aunty Sal was short and slight—
’Twas thought ungraceful to be tall —
And shoulders sloped like bottlenecks
When Aunty Sal went to the ball.
The ballroom was the township school
With books and desks well out of sight,
Bedecked with flags and greenery,
With lamps and sconces burnished bright.
Sweet toned the concertina was
On that gay night of festival,
And company was most select
When Aunty Sal went to the ball.
Two ringlets hung beside each ear ;
She wore a comb of tortoise-shell;
A sprig of lilac nestled where
Her modest bosom rose and fell;
Steel buckles glistened on her shoes;
Her waist’s circumference was small;
There was no scarcity of beaux
When Aunty Sal went to the ball.
Her skirt was flounced and frilled and tucked,
And ended with a flowing train
That swung around her as she waltzed,
Or circled through the lady’s chain.
Her partner held her close and tight,
Perhaps to save her from a fall,
For floors were fast and smooth as glass
When Aunty Sal went to the ball.
She’d blush and smile behind her fan
While swinging corners in the sets ;
Her ’kerchief bore the soft perfume
Of musk or parma violets.
A chaperon was always there,
Stiff-backed and grim beside the wall,
Who kept the gallants well at bay
While Aunty Sal was at the ball.
HE'D JUST AS SOON
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
YOUNG ’UN : “Did you ever run across an old bloke by
the same name as meself drivin ’ the coach from
'Ungerford? 'E 'ad one eye, and”
OLD ’U N: “That thievin' cow! Wot do you know
about ’im?”
YOUNG ’UN : “Oh — er—I was goin' ter tell yer he was me
ole man, but it doesn’t matter.”
Her supper was a joyless thing;
Shyly demure and prim and straight,
She nibbled bits of this or that
And toyed with dainties on her plate.
’Twas thought good form in those old days
If ladies’ appetites were small;
Yet they danced on till break of day
When Aunty Sal went to the ball.
Untiringly they’d sway and swing
Until the east was gold and grey,
And kookaburras in the gums
Pealed out the signal it was day.
Those moving figures, fading lights—
Back through the years I see them all,
Dim objects in the mists of time,
And Aunty Sal belle of the ball.

TH E secret of the success of New Process Linseed Oil lies in its ENTIRE
FREEDOM FROM ALBUMENOIDS—a freedom which is absolutely
assured by the scientific method of its production. The process adopted
extracts the pure oil from the Linseed and leaves every particle of albumenoid,
or non-drying matter, behind.
New Process Linseed Oil is manufactured from the best Calcutta seed; it is a
perfect oil, free from all impurities and sediment, crystal clear to the last drop,
and never varies from the standard of its high quality.
Think of the two-fold benefit which New Process Linseed Oil assures to the
painter. It benefits the pocket by saving both time and material—and it
benefits the paint, making it more efficient and less likely to perish.
Hundreds of painters throughout Australia are demanding New Process Linseed
Oil, and thousands more will demand it when they realise the advantages it affords.
NEW PROCESS LINSEED MEAL
Now the same process that gives you a more efficient Linseed Oil by leaving all
albumenoid matter behind, gives you a better Linseed Meal—a meal obviously
richer in albumenoids than the cake procured by the old method of pressing the
seed. It has been conclusively proved that while oil is a heat former it is
albumenoids in the material that count. The opinion of Messrs. Thorpes Ltd.,
the well-known Stock Food specialists, is that heat units are not necessary in this
country, but that albumenoids certainly are, and they have backed up their
opinion by purchasing the whole output of HAROLD MhGGITT’S New
Process Linseed Meal.
If you are interested in Linseed Oil or Linseed Meal, be careful to ask for
HAROLD MEGGITT’S NEW PROCESS.
Remember, there is only one Harold Meggitt in Australia and
only one New Process Linseed Oil, of which Harold Meggitt is
the Sole Manufacturer in the Commonwealth.
NOTE : —Harold Meggitt has no connection with any other firm of Linseed
Oil Manufacturers anywhere in Australia .

NO RABBIT HAS A CHANCE TO ESCAPE
FROM THE DEATH-DEALING FUMES OF
CALCIUM
ONWHB
CYANIDE
It is dust blown into the warren; it mantles tile walls, makes every opening visible, so that no
rabbit can escape, no matter how deep the dead-ends.
It gives off deadly fumes over twenty-four hours. Every time a rabbit moves, deadly gas meets
it, killing instantly.
And it kills when blown into open logs, hollow trees and rocks without closing.
CALCIUM CYANIDE is economical, non-inflammable, non-explosive, harmless to man and
stock. The machine for its application is of the knapsack type, light, simple, easily portable.

“Brud”: Strange that “E.8.1t.” (B.
17/4/’24) should come to light with his par. at
a time when arguments on pigs cutting their throats
when swimming were hot and strong among mem-
bers of a cattle-musterers’ camp in the pukka pig-
country of the Lower Macquarie (N.S.W.). Honors
were fairly even when the camp broke up. A
couple of days ago a fair lump of a boar was dis-
covered by two of us having a bogey in a 16,000-yard
tank about five miles from the river, so we took the
opportunity of thoroughly testing the theory. For
40 minutes that grunter was not allowed to rest
for one second, and when it was considered that
we had given him a fair go we allowed him ashore.
He was so fresh that we could not wheel him per
boot; and there certainly were no signs of blood
left behind him on the scalded plain.

opossum. He is nocturnal, living during the day )n
tree pipes, or under the bark, and in southern lati-
tudes he hibernates during the winter. One variety
is found in Papua, but he is bigger than the little
fellow who lives in Tasmania —the pigmy of the
family. His tail carries fur at the root only,
continuing bare to a prehensile tip. This, with
his size, will identify him. His want of shyness is
characteristic of all the “’possums,” and this con-
fidence seems to increase as the variety grows smaller.

and a 15-30-h.p. tractor supplying the motive power,
Mills covered 105 acres in the day. Last harvest
two youths in another part of the district took
off 302 bags of wheat from 30 acres in a day, using
a tractor-drawn header.
“X2X”: Skin-divers of Torres Strait are
frequently afflicted with a swelling of the limbs,
With intense pain in the joints, a burning sensation
in the skin, and fever, often accompanied by extremely
high temperatures. Sometimes a man will be
incapacitated for four or five days at a stretch, and
it is on record that at least one case has ended
fataUy. Practically no research
has ever been carried out in con-
nection with the disease, so that
its etiology is obscure, but some
believe that it is caused by the
venom of sea-urchins. These small
objects abound in those waters, and
the diver’s bare skin is constantly
coming into contact with them.
If a solution of ammonia is sponged
over the skin of a sufferer, it
will usually relieve the pain and
the fever, frequently effecting a
cure altogether in the early stages.
As the animal venoms are neutral-
ised by strong alkalis, this makes
it look as though the sea-urchin
is at the bottom of the trouble.
“Ceegee”: Talking of the
effect of shock on animals, to-
day while at lunch I skimmed
some tea leares off my tea and
threw them over my shoulder. Our
pup, weary for the time of drag-
ging socks and things about the
camp,, happened to be lying m
the right place to receive about
half a spoonful of the hot tea on
his back. As soon as the liquid
hit him he jumped and yelped.
He kept this up for about one
minute, then ran into the cook’s
tent, where he lay and whined for
about another minute. Then he
pegged out. We thought he was
coming one of his rather subtle
jokes at first, but —I buried him
this afternoon. The chap opposite
me at table chanced to be watch-
ing the pup for some time before
the tea landed, and is quite sure
nothing else hit him. So there we
have an apparently healthy pup killed in two
minutes—by half a spoonful of tea.
“C.E.G.”: Re “H.L.S.” (B. 27/3/’24) on
swamp cancer. I cured a very bad case in a mare
of mine with black treacle, Stockholm tar and
kerosene (only a dash of the two latter), put on
with a swab every day. From observation I am
satisfied that swamp cancer is caused by flies where
the skin has been broken. I have seen it appear only
in the heavy wet when the grass is long and flies
are bad (though not necessarily in real swampy
country). I think the fly responsible is a little
black one, not unlike the house fly, only smaller.
My mare had the skin broken over the vein that
runs along the side of the belly; another case 1 saw
started from a scratch with a piece of wire, and in
two further instances I know of broken skin turning
into swamp cancer in the wet season.

“Centre”: There’s a near-white youngster
of 60-odd up in N. Queensland who almost keeps
himself in “spots” by winning bets from strangers
over the strength of his teeth. One of his show
pieces is to fill a bucket with water, go down on
his knees, take the edge of the bucket between his
teeth and then stand up with the bucket of unspilled
water held between his ivories. He can support
his own weight (list, odd) by biting into a tag of
leather hanging from a beam. But he met his
Waterloo recently in the shape of a Torres Strait
islander who tore the entire outer husk off a green
cocoanut with his teeth. The oldster tried it, but was
out of his element and made a very poor showing.
His explanation was that the moist tough fibres set
his teeth on edge. The German prisoner in France
who tried to make a few shillings by picking up
a rifle by the muzzle, using his teeth only to do it
with, hadn’t a bad set of chewers, but had less to
say about them after watching a small-size Tommy
bite a piece clean off the end of a ljin. rubber hose.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: The lingual dissimilarity be-
tween island Polynesians and the Maori, mentioned
by “Pedro” (B. 8/5/’24), is more pronounced in
print than in tone. The Tongan name for house is
fate; in Maori, whare. Yet both sound the same
when spoken quickly by a native. The missionaries
who put the language into writing are responsible.
The Maori wh is sounded f and one of the difficulties
in teaching Hori English is to get him to differenti-
ate between r and l. The consonant g has the
sound of ng. The Maori writes it thus while the
Samoan drops the n in print. Pago-Pago, pro-
nounced “Pango-Pango,” is an instance. By Hie
way, Pratt’s Samoan Dictionary is the best authority
on the philological matters of Polynesia.
* * * *
“T.S.L.”: A while back someone was talk-
ing about the casual-fruiting of mango trees. I hjave
had experience with them for over 30 years and jthe
best fruitbearer I have seen was in the northern
district of Mackay (Q.). This tree bore a heavy
crop in December, 1922, and continued to give a
plentiful supply till March, 1923. It flowered during
the latter end of this period, and within three moiiths
of the first crop it bore a second crop which was
extremely heavy. And it went on turning out a
good supply of first-class mangoes until February
of this year.
“St. Kitt’s”: Apropos the statement that
death following snakebite is mainly due to shock.
I remember an argument some years ago between
“La-di-dah” Walker, of the Towers (Q.), and Moran,
a Ravenswood publican, both snake experts. Walker
contended that no one died from the actual poison,
all deaths being due to shock, and he offered to allow
a death-adder to bite him and not treat the
wound in any way. Moran to provide the snake.
As the demonstration was likely to draw a fair
crowd, “La-di-dah” suggested that the Theatre Royal
be engaged and that the hospital committee control
the concern in aid of that institution’s funds. Moran
replied that he had no objection provided Walker
had the show on a Saturday night, so they could all
attend the funeral on the Sunday without losing a
day’s work. Whether the hospital committee was
afraid of a tragedy or not, I can’t say, but it would
have nothing to do with the experiment, and the
test never came off.
* * * *
“Lightnin’ Bill”: Tell “Kaitoa” (B.
l/5/’24) that at 8 a.m. on Feb. 15, this year, Tom
Hurry of Yan Yean (Vic.) left Morissy’s place, six
miles on the Whittlesea side of Yea, with 456
Riverina-bred merino wethers, and that night at
10.30 put them in his own paddock two miles past
Whittlesea—a distance of 36 miles. They were
carrying six months’ wool, and crossed in the journey
Junction Hill and Kinglake mountain. Also, it
rained all day. Can anyone beat this?
* * * •
“Werrimee’: From a scrub one day I saw
Binghi and his gin catch a couple of ducks with
snares on the Logan River. Some ducks were
feeding along close to the bank, and the couple
waited for them at a little weedy inlet. The snare
was a thin cord made of bark fibre and human hair,
with a noose at one end. The other end was tied
to a long, slender stick. Each operator was con-
cealed among tall rushes, holding the snare over the
water in the same way as when fishing with a rod
line, but as still as waiting herons. In ones and
twos the ducks came slowly round the bend. Very
gently Binghi slipped the noose over a diving head.
But he did not pull. The line trailed in the water
while he waited tensely till the other noose was
slipped round a feathered neck. Then both were
hauled up quickly.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: During the war I took a draft
of rejected “boys” back to the island of Niue, the
solitary outlier of Polynesia. One of them, suffering
from an internal complaint, was received with loud
cheers by his relatives, who had been against the
youth linking up with the Enzeds. This is how
they had worked the oracle. A moko lizard was
imprisoned in a bottle and buried beneath a cocoa-
nut palm with appropriate curses and a plea that
temporary illness should overtake the departed one.
At Narrow Neck camp, Auckland (M.L.), a puzzled
M.O. rejected the youth as unfit a month after be
had drunk the milk of the eocoanuts. Another bov
with the same draft suddenly went lame in the
right leg. He put it down to pourri-pourri, contending
that the girl he left behind in Niue had cursed an
impression of his footprints when he said good-bye
to her.
* * * *
Some bees who camp out: —
“Keystring”: Tell “Tester” (B. 17/4/’24) that
I have twice seen bees make “hives” on the out-
side of trees. The first was on Ramornie station
(N.S.W.), and it showed quite a lot of comb when
I discovered it during the winter of 1901. I used
to see it weekly thereafter till the following November,
when I found the whole lot had fallen to the ground,
the spot being marked by fully a kerosene-tin of
broken comb and some millions of ants. I con-
cluded that the hot weather had melted some of the
wax that was holding the mass on to the underneath
side of the 9in. redgum limb to which it was attached,
and that the weight of honey had proved too much. The
second honey depository is still to be seen on the
side (between the spurs) of a stinging-tree in the
scrub on Richmond range (N.S.W.). This one is well
sheltered from the sun, but, being in a groove or
channel on the back of the tree, the industrious little
chaps must suffer some inconvenience in wet weather.
Nevertheless it is a boomer nest, and guarded by
the most aggressive swarm I’ve struck. By the
way, has the Council noted that the hollow of the
stinging-tree is always perfectly clean, and thus must
provide about the best nesting-place in the bush for
bees?
“Flong”: A few years ago in the scrub on the
sand hummocks quite close to the sea in Vic. a
swarm of bees established themselves in a small
shrub about 3ft. high. • There was about 401 b. of
honey in the “nest.” Another swarm made a home
in the rushes on the bank of the Merri River, and
EXTRAVAGANCE.
MUM: “Young Steve’s terrible rough on
socles.”
DAD: “Yes, ’e must think I’m made o’ money
goin’ to town so often.”
when I saw them they plainly intended to stay there.
Incidentally, “Gouger” (B. 10/4/’24) is wrong when
he says he saw drone bees, wild or otherwise, carry-
ing home nectar from the gum blossoms. It is
physically impossible for the male bee to store any
food for transportation—only the worker can do
that. The drone obtains all his food in the hive.
“Fordson”: If “Tester” looks up an old Queens-
lander dated 6/8/’2l he will see a photo of a
beehive on the outside of a tree —eight layers of
comb close beside one another. This is the only
case I know of.
THE BUCCANEERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Odors rich and rare and fruity
From hedged orchards come to me;
Everywhere around is beauty
Spread and squandered lavishly;
Honey-birds fly drunk with nectar
Hither, thither through the noon;
Not a breeze among the leafage
Breaks the lustrous mid-day swoon.
From the green bush calling, crying,
Hither lured by luscious fruit,
Feathered plunderers come flying,
Buccaneers in quest of loot;
Satin-birds and red rosellas,
Silver-eyes and hordes of bees,
Feast and fatten on the cherries
Reddening the orchard trees.
Flute-like notes about him flinging—
Notes that rise and fall again—
What is it yon thrush is singing
To the world of birds and men?
This, oh this, the thrush is singing
On the leafy branch a-sway:
“Kisses, blisses, ruddy cherries,
Take them while you can and may.
“Ere youth pass with joy and wonder
And red cherries fall and rot,
Clasp the spoil and grasp the plunder—-
Fruit and blisses—caring not.”
Lovely, liquid notes outpouring—
Notes that fell and rose again—
This, oh this, the thrush was singing
To the world of birds and men.
So, day-long, while beauty squandered
Glories round about, I strayed
Till grey shadows woke and wandered
Silently through grove and glade,
Till the thrush, his tired wings folding,
Ceased his singing, soft and clear,
And, red-breasted, satin-plumaged,
Homeward sped each buccaneer.

Hhe Neur ESSEX
A SIX
BUILT BY HUDSON
UNDER HUDSON PATENTS.
A 30-Minute Ride Will Win You!
It is an easy way to tell if the new Essex gives greater
value than was ever provided at its price.
Take a ride. It has answered the question for hundreds.
No car we ever introduced has had such a reception. It
is drawing bigger crowds. It is selling faster. Every-
one is talking about it.
Priced much lower than ever before, the new Essex pro-
vides a handsomer body, with even greater riding com-
fort than the “Four,” because of a special rear suspension
system.
And its 6-cylinder motor, built by Hudson, gives the
smoothness of performance for which the Super-Six is
faitious.
Has Qualities of Both Hudson and the Former Essex.
In all that counts for long, satisfac-
tory service at low cost the new
Essex combines the most suitable
details from both.
See how handling is simplified. All
controls are easy, simple and sure in
operation. Steering is as easy as guid-
ing a bicycle. Its motor flexibility
makes gear shifting almost unneces-
sary, except in starting. Note how
comfortably and safely it holds even
the roughest roads at all speeds.
Petrol, oil and tyre mileages are ex-
ceptional. In every respect the New
Essex meets the requirements of de-
pendable, comfortable transporta-
tion, free of burdensome expense.
A ride will give you a conviction of
goodness and quality, such as you
never expected in a car of its price.

LETTER

On Tuesday morning King-street oppo-
site St. James’s seethed with excitement that
rose to geyser heights when noon brought
Gladys Moncrieff on her brother’s arm to
the steps of the hoary church. In her bridal
trappings the Firm’s singing star was stag-
ing the most popular turn of a brilliant
career. To meet bridegroom Tom Moore
and Dean Talbot, who stood by, she passed
up an aisle that looked as though the entire
millinery of Flora had dropped upon it.
For her big moment Gladys trailed a wedding
garment of ivory georgette, luscious with
chenille embroideries and tropical with trails
of orange blossom. A wash of georgette
and Mechlin lace whereon true lover's knots
and rosebuds were all a-blow was engineered
by little Digger Higham, in ivory satin, and
niece Mavis Moncrieff, in powder blue. The
whole was misted over by a tulle veil that
cascaded from a coronet of Mechlin lace and
pearls—very effective on the dark head of
the principal lady. Pretty Clarice Ilard-
wicke and Dorothy Taylor (she all the way
from Melbourne), with Thelma Foster-
Jones and Ruth Higham, flashing pinks and
blues and mauve and violet frocking, and
carrying old-fashioned posies, completed the
strong bridal support, while best-man Robert
Chisholm and Teddy Ferris cheered the
’groom. Diamond and sapphire rings, gold
wristlet watches and strings of pearls were
scattered among the bridesmaids by the male
lead, who also endowed his bride with a
diamond-upholstered circlet. In the front
pews a galaxy of stars shone with a sartorial
splendor that dazzled the eye. Here were
Nellie Stewart, Irene Vanbrugh and Dion
Boucicault, Phil Smith, the Stigants and the
E. J. Taits. Lottie Sargent, George High-
land and Jack Cannot were other front-
rankers who afterwards hasted to the Went-
worth, where the cake and its trimmings
were washed down in the old-fashioned way.
From .Elizabeth-street up to the corner of
Macquarie-street the wedding sleuths filled
footpath and roadway. They were grouped
on hotel roofs; they had climbed the railings
and steps of St. James’s; they even orna-
mented the front of the Supreme Court;
they were banked solid up the rise of Phillip-
street. A large lorry outside Paris House
presented possibilities, and in a minute
women, fat and thin, old and young, were all
over it; and men hung on by the suction of
their rubber heels to precarious fastnesses.
At 12 o’clock trams crawled up and down
for two blocks, and motors found the street
a closed way. When Gladys arrived she was
held up for 10 minutes, and during the inter-
val bowed and smiled and blew kisses to the
phalanxes of admirers. Then she reached
the steps and posed for the last “before
matrimony” photograph. After that the
crowd waited, grew larger, and skirmished
for more strategic viewpoints for the exit.
Half an hour passed—trams crawled more
slowly, stopped altogether, and banked up
right in front of the church. Good-bye to
hope for the people not on the footpath
beside St. James’s! Intrepid youths clam-
bered to the tops of the carriages. Groups
rushed from the other side of the street,
making the jamb around the church devasta-
ting ; and bride and ’groom on emerging were
in a near way of being killed with kindness,
the principal lady being almost reduced to
tears before a way was cleared to the
limousine.
For the memorial to its soldier-dead the
University has finally decided on a peal of
bells—they call it a carillon, which means
that the bells have a sort of barrel-organ
attachment that dispenses with the ancient
rope-hauling. There will be 45 bells, and
the cost is to be something like £15,000 —
each of the different Faculties will contri-
bute its mite to the total. These mites
will be assembled by means of fetes and
dances and suchlike; so in the end good
old General Public will be responsible for
a few of the pennies in the hat. Where
the sufferer from insomnia may find sanctu-
ary is already a problem; and if the Uni.
carillon is to be in action bright and early
on the Sabbath morn, the honest toiler in
the neighborhood can take up his bed and
walk.
With Mrs. George Sargent, who died at
her Rose Bay home last w-eek, passes, not
a romantic figure, but a figure of the romance
of hard work and the adventure of industry.
Forty years ago she and her husband started
to make the Sargent pie which now goes
into the daily building-up of many tens of
thousands of Australians. Up till a few
weeks ago she continued to take a most
active interest in the business, and kept a
managerial eye on the 50 shops which
proudly hoist the sign of Sargent’s. She
was a well-known enthusiast in the cause
of the poor; and if kind hearts are more
than coronets, then this lady needed a whole
school of' heralds to herself. She had been
a great war-worker, and acted as fairy god-
mother to a flock of grandchildren—some
real, some adopted. Charity committees will
miss her generous cheques and her willing
help.
That young Ensign Nicholson of the Mil-
waukee who was badly injured in an argu-
ment between his motor-bike and one of
Sydney’s tramcars, and after lying for
months unconscious and semi-conscious in
Sydney Hospital was put back on the path
to health and shipped to the States, is once
again the picture of energy. The sight of
one eye is lost, but otherwise Nicholson is
as good as now. lie surprised Mrs. Dan
Kelly by calling on her at her hotel in New
York—the call was in return for the many
she had paid him when he w?is in hospital
here. At the time the North Sydney sur-
geon’s wife believed she was doing a friendly
act to an unknown American lad, a stranger in
a strange land : but here’s where the arm of
coincidence intrudes. In conversation in
New York the two discovered that the
Nicholsons and the Coffees (Mrs. Kelly was
a Coffee) are old family friends, an aunt of
the lady’s being the ensign’s godmother.
The Beale family—Mr., Mrs., Ruth and
Mary—are off to Alaska, to taste for them-
selves the deep purples and blues of its won-
derful sunlit nights. Ruth’s halo for her
Barnardo work will put the Aurora Borealis
in the shade if it doesn’t polish up its lustres
to the highest effulgence. The capable young
speaker gave a soul-stirring address early in
the week, when the Manly branch of the Bar-
nardo workers was being enrolled. Captain
Gilbert Nobbs and his vivid wife lent their
new home for the kick-off, and the afternoon
w r as as enthusiastic as a revivalist meeting.
The old Pope home at Ashfield has been
bought for the furtherance of the Barnardo
work.
Frances Nikawa, a daughter of Red
Indian chieftains—she claims the tribe of
Cree—made her first bow to a Sydney audi-
ence the other night in the King’s Hall.
Clothed in full regalia of her tribe, with a
hawk’s feather in her hair, a slim young
thing with a speaking voice like a wind in
the trees, she declaimed the legends of her
people with a primitive fire and a freedom
of gesture that brought into high relief child-
hood visions of the last of the Mohicans and
other Red Injun braves. One legend of an
Indian maid waiting for her pale-face lover
has a quaint climax; for a second we see
ourselves as others see us when the girl’s
tribe, at last convinced that the white man
had died on the trail back to his love, re-
mark consolingly: “He was pale, but he was
true!”
Greet Ethel Osborn, Sydney’s new
soprano, who made such a hit at the Apollo
concert a few nights ago. Last Friday her
proud teacher, Roland Foster, invited musi-
cal Sydney to
the Salonola
Hall to listen
to the Mt.
Everest notes
of the song-
bird’s top re-
gister. These
poured out as
crystal - pure
as ever, and
there was a
loud burst of
approval
when it was
a n nounced
that Ethel
was giving a
Town Hall re-
cital on May
29. The sin-
ger added two
bird songs to
the show
“Caro Nome”
number; and her imitation of a laughing-
jack would have turned the small boys who
compete in the bird-calls at the Bird Lovers’
concert green with envy—it certainly would
give Galli-Curci food for thought.
The dance engineered by Mrs. Osbourne
England and Dr. Foulds’s wife to stock the
library shelves at Iviera House (the seaside
home for country women) filled the big din-
ing-room of the Cavalier last Thursday even-
ing. There was a great rally of Manly-
siders owing to the fact that both secretaries
belong to that exquisite spot of sunshine
and sands and sophistication. The Eng-
land couple entertained a large party, she
contrasting blue and silver finery with her
honey-colored hair. In this group, and the
belle of the party, was Dr. Geordie Hamil-
ton s bride, in froeking the shade of a purple
pansy. Louie Tatham, who goes off to mar-
riage and the cannibal isles in a week or two,
was having a final fling, in flame-colored taf-
fetas. With her came sister Mrs. Lystcr
Ormsby, in grey and silver. Pattie Reid and
a Sharman girl, from Maoriland, were other
charmers. Sydney Grammar’s head brought
Mrs. Dettman, and Mrs. Foulds presented
old-rose satins and impeccable hairdressing
to the gaze.
Ruby Coxliead, the Minerva of the Vaga-
bonds, is going about wreathed in a Goddess
of Victory smile. The Vags. ran a jumble
sale at Paddy’s Markets the other day, and it
netted nearly £23. There was £2-odd in
their treasury (it is the modern widow’s
cruse).; so the objective—the purchase of an
artificial limb for a boy whose own leg had
been badly mangled—was gained. The
clever little company stages another comedy
in June, and that’s to help a brave man of
15 who is having a round with Fate.
Who’d expect to find an authority on
heraldry and period styles in furniture on
a fruit-farm at Lyra (Q.)? The subject of
the picture alongside is Herbert Cole, black-
and-white and
color - artist,
whose exqui-
site draughts-
manship and
fine color-
sense have
turned out a
work on
heraldry that
is a delight to
th e connois-
s e u r. M r.
Cole dropped
into the New
C o ntinent
from the Old
World, and is
drinking in
gallons of
Q u e ensland's
best brand of
sunshine on
his son’s
farm. His
special art metier is illustration in the
humorous and satirical vein, some of his
finest work in this line accompanying “In-
goldsby.” Our light and color have insti-
gated him to take up his brush again in the
pursuit of “the peculiar and strangely deli-
cate effects of morning and evening light.’’
He is enthusiastic over “Australia’s fine
school of painters,” and has even a kindly
word to say for our railways.
Heavy social backing promises to make the
ball engineered by the Country Women’s
Association a great success. The Palais
Royal will be the scene of the singing supper-
dance this year, and the night chosen for the
wild and woolly gathering is Thursday in
Dudley Cup week. Both sets of vice-regals
will be present; and a cold supper will be
served at the tables in the boxes under the
absurd palanquins. Songs in which every-
one is expected to join will shake the rafters,
and the Palais band will feature “Blue
Danube” and old tunes in new time. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers is President and Mrs. Tony
Hordern vice-president of the flutter, and the
takings and rakings will go to pay for the
seaside home for tired Mrs. Wayback and
her parched offspring at Deewhy.
The University Sports Union ripped up
the carpet in the big dining-room for the
annual whirl last Friday. Cohorts of youth
filled the room by kick-off time, and once the
frocking got a chance a prize collection of
butterflies was simply drab by comparison.
All the color in Nature plus a few art shades
were present in satin and velvet, lace and
georgette. _ G. P. Stuckey was president of
the committee, and H. Heydon secretary.
The animals —the nice domestic ones that
spend their lives in the service of man; not
the Bolshie plutocrats who luxuriate at
Taronga, serving none—are to have a ball
given for their benefit. It will be held at
the Wentworth on July 18, and all the
takings will swell the funds of the S.P.C.A.
There’s to be a competition of beautiful
Chinese shawls; and Dame Nellie and fair
Ellaline Terriss will decide the winner.
Eadith Walker, who is godmothering the
flutter, is giving a prize for a twosome in
an old-fashioned waltz; Mrs. Luscombe
Newman offers another for the best polka.
. The Palais Royal, all dressed up as though
for the Feast of the Lanterns, turned a shining
floor to the feet of hundreds of enthusiasts
in the cause of the Royal Hospital for
Women. Former Mayoress McElhone
headed a committee that had Mrs. A. E.
Mills for treasurer and was secretaried by
Mrs. Brown Craig and Miss Shand. Sur-
geon McKelvey’s pretty wife was another
helper—in black panne.
St. John’s within the Uni. has pencilled
June 24 on the ivory tablets for its annual
hop. Len McKeon and Desmond Sykes, who
have secretaried many a previous flutter,
have once again sharpened up their quills.
The building fund for the new hostel for
the deaf and dumb will benefit by a kiddies’
party to be held on the Orvieto this (Thurs-
day) afternoon. The big boat was hung up
on a Brisbane sandbank for a couple of
days last week ; but the tides were kind, and
helped to lift her off on Friday.
The medical Fraser chick, Isabel, had a
thrill the other day when her young man
(he’s another Dr. Donald Fraser) cabled
her that the engagement ring he had sent
was merely a forerunner of liimself. The
circlet supports a square emerald set about
with small diamonds. He arrives later in the
year.
Eve Parsons, now living in Mosman, but
who hails from Queensland —her father was
Charles Parsons, of Winton and Longreach
—has uttered the magic word that has made
Arthur Browne the happiest inhabitant of
Lindfield. The marriage takes place before
the end of the year.
Isabel Garland is dazzling Bellevue TTill
with the new engagement-ring which she
accepted the other day from Commander
Johnstone Soutter, of H.M.A.S. Platypus.
Isabel’s father was Jock Garland, K.C. and
M.L.C.
The State’s Viking has added another to

Henceforth the United Service Club will

Every Saturday night after his concert
tenor Hackett has dashed off to the Ambas-
sadors and jazzed till the shutters have gone
up. With him and his ermine-wrapped wife
have been the managerial Gravestock couple,
and generally Bratza and a few others. The
Cherniavsky brothers are also dancers, and
Jan and Mischel with their wives and big
brother Leo are others who have been drop-
ping in to the white-and-gold room below
Pitt-street.
Those Cherniavskys now are a gentle-
looking trio; and their music possesses a pas-
sion of melancholy. A long time has gone
past since they gave their first concert in
Australia, and the velvet breeches and ruffled
shirts of those days have made way for more
conventional tailorings. Unlike most artists
who have been infant prodigies, these three
do. not despise study, and the rare quality of
the music they have been pouring over Con-
servatorium audiences is the best proof that
the study is not wasted.
Jimmy Osborne, who arrived in Sydney
on the Orvieto, spent part of his time abroad
in the Riviera. At a restaurant where danc-
ing was in progress he observed a fascinating
young woman gazing his way with obvious
• interest. Being reluctant to hurt her feel-
ings, he suggested that they might step a
measure, and was in the very act of re-
presenting himself as a Russian grand duke,
temporarily absent from his native land
owing to Bolshevik machinations, when she
interrupted brightly with: “Well, Jimmy,
and how’s Sydney?” For the first time he
recognised the unknown as Fayette Perry!
A Brisbane postscript:—
Gertrude Elliott is talking “Woman to Woman”
at His Majesty’s, and crowds roll up to listen to her.
The first-nighters included Lady Pat Blackwood
(who is putting up at Government House), the Cecil
0 Beirnes, Cecil Palmers, A. H. Whittinghams, Glynn
Connollys, Boss Munros, Cowlishaws, Chandlers and
Bruches, and Miss O’Shea and her brothers.
Mayoress Barry' tea-ed the handsome Gertrude and
the Diggers’ League gave her a big party at Lennon’s,
where all the war-workers gathered. Brian Lawrence,
the child wonder, with a rich contralto full of feeling,
sang, Digger G. P. Hanna monologued, and the
Harold Burnett lady also contributed to the pro-
gramme. Frazer East greeted the guests, and Major
Maddock, the R.S.S.I.L.’s new president, announced
the names of the throng, amongst them being Lieut.-
Governor Lennon, the Spencer Brownes, the Cowley
and Philp ladies, the Mayoral Barrys, the Jacksons
and Mrs. Tom Ryan.
Mrs. Bruche gave a party at the Barracks for
Mrs. Jobson, of Sydney', and Lady Forbes Robertson
and her daughter were there, as well as most of our
Naicest.
The Graceville bowlers were at home to a crowd
invited by President J. K. Cannan and his wife.
Black mariette sheathed the hostess and an ostrich
plume topped her headgear. The presidents and
members of other bowling clubs came with their
wives, and besides tea and talk there were driving
and drawing competitions.
St. Colomb’s Hall held about 200 little people at
the fancy ball fixed up by the Guild for the church
funds. Emily Moon, as a knitting bag, scored the
prize for the most original dress, Dick Whittingham
and a golliwog carried off another, and a tiny bride
and ’groom won a special.
Constance Buchan, in cyclamen satin, soloed at
the Apollos’ concert at the Exhibition and had
many vegetable offerings handed up to her. The
audience held the Stumms, Isaacses, Maxwells and
other music-lovers.
Mrs. George Sampson gave an afternoon party'
among roses at Lennon’s. Autumn brown and
sand-color decked the hostess, and the tea-drinkers
included the J. T. Bell, Bruche, Jobson, Gilbert
Wilson and Harry' Mills matrons, the Whittinghams,
Chandlers and Ross Munros, Mollie Brenan and Jean
Graham,
The Koopa staged the moonlight jazz organised by
the Automobilites. The dancing decks were cur-
tained-in with flags and the saloon housed the supper.
The J. F. Maxwells entertained the Master Painters’
delegates with a motor run to Mount Cootha, and
then gave them tea on the Alice-street balcony of
Parliament House. The lady did her hostessing in
king blue and grey with a braided cloak.
A.-D.-C. Jack Turner’s mamma has arrived from
England, and is now at Montpelier.

The Madden lady, who landed back last
week after two years on the other side of
the equator, met an avalanche of welcomes
y afternoon when daughter Leslie
Nelkin had gathered a cheery party at the
Oriental (Hotel. Eleanor Williams, who
accompanied the late Chief Justice’s widow
on the jaunt, shared in the greetings. Louis
Nelkin, the solitary male atom there, braved a
sea of petticoats to help his wife. The hostess
was in a mole-colored coat-frock of velvet
hemmed in with fur, and had a dash of blue
tin her brown velvet toque; and the star
uest trailed black silk, with a paste medallion
■twinkling on a Frenchy little lid. The lady
■confided to her pals that she had cut her
visit short _to miss the flood of Exhibition
visitors which threatened to swamp London.
How-d ye-do’s were said in the winter-garden ;
an orchestra provided a harmonious backing
for talk, and tea was spread on picturesquely
flowered tables in the dining-room. 'A
special board was earmarked for old friends
and a few extra-special guests. Among
these were Priminister Bruce’s wife, Mrs.
Hall Thompson, the wife of Anglican Arch-
bish. Lees, the youngest Madden daughter,
a ?d the Harry Baillieu, Guy Madden, Albert
Miller, George Chirnside, Leo Cussen and E.
Nelkm matrons.
The spectacular magnificence of “Aida”
made the most Mas 6 first-nighter take notice
a jt Her Majesty’s on Thursday evening. The
third scence is a thing of sheer beauty, show-
ing the palm-fringed banks of the Nile, with
its waters shining greenly under the pale
moonbeams, and the temple of Isis in the
gleaming background. But the most stir-
ring spectacle is unveiled in an avenue lead-
>']S to the city of Thebes. The stage is
nlled with people, while in the forefront a
group of gold-and-white dancing girls flutter
I] k e a flight of butterflies, with a group of
what look like infant golliwogs whirling
beside them. Phyllis Archibald, as the
1 rincess, airs several varieties of Tuttish
draperies, which show how we moderns have
dipned into the past for our styles. She
takes her final curtain in flowing white
hangings, moored at the hips with a beaten
silver scarf. In one act Concato, as Aida,
is bandaged spirally with silk fringe backed
by a green cloak depending from one shoul-
der- The vice-regal Lady Bridges, from
Adelaide, was boxed with Melba; and the
otradbrokes, who have been working overtime
with nightly attendances at the opera, had
their usual seats, though the mercurial Count-
ess put in half the time with Melba. George
Tallis, who seldom looks at a show from the
front these days, was penned with his wife;
Mrs. George Chirnside was sighted in the
circle; and Mrs. Van Assche, an habitual
first-nighter, _ beamed down on daughter
Sylvia, who is in the chorus.
A few sharp-eyed people had their first
glimpse of stage-manager Farinetti in
Aida. _ The burly director left his post
111 .the wings to mingle with the crowd of
priests, priestesses and lookers-on and guide
their movements with stealthy gestures and
muttered Italian. He wore an Egyptian
head-dress and a pale blue pinny over an
ordinary evening-suit, but it would have
taken an X-ray glance to discover that this
outside member of the fellaheen was stalk-
ing about in shiny pumps. It was neces-
sary for him to join the throng. He had
commanded a larger army of supers, in a
performance of the opera at the Constanza
Theatre in Rome, and he ventured into the
limelight so that the same evolutions might
be repeated without a hitch. His part of
the show was a great success. It was when
the comely Amneris (Phyllis Archibald) lay
down in her grief in the first scene of the
Jni Urt h act tliat arrangements went awry.
Lhe ushers rushed in to reward the recum-
bent princess with vegetation, and she had
to arise hurriedly to escape being buried
It was a diverting episode, but it left an
impression that the ushers hadn’t been suffi-
ciently rehearsed—they had anticipated their
cue by a couple of minutes.
Aida” was down for earlier presentation,
but four long trumpets, which blare at the
head of the procession before Pharaoh, had
not come to hand, and the artistic con-
science of the management forbade the pro-
duction of the opera without them. The in-
struments have _a couple of stops, and are
not obtainable in Australia. Incidentally
the trumpeters require much wind and train-
ing, especially as they have to walk round
in a semi-circle, and for a part of the jour-
ney must miss the conductor's guiding baton.
But they make a fine show, and their con-
tribution of sound is as near to heavenly as
one can expect from a brazen throat.
The Bulletin's beloved Melbourne chief,
Edmund Fisher, was buried in St. Kilda
Cemetery last week. Captain Charles
Atkins, solicitor Joe Woolf, editor Mulchi-
nock, of the Weekly Times, The Bulle-
tin's Melbourne staff and sundry other old
friends followed the dead poet to the quiet
corner which he had long ago chosen for his
last home. Fisher died as he had wished—
m harness. Sometimes he was compelled
by the nature of his malady to retire tem-
porarily from his desk; but, once the enemy
had been routed to nurse itself again for a
further onslaught, his brain was up and
doing and his busy fingers were ticking out
copy on his typewriter. Though he suffered
terribly, his will-to-live was magnificent, and
In®. Say philosophy helped him out of crises
which would have finished more robust men.
To those who have been left to miss his
friendship, there is a little grain of comfort
m the knowledge that his end was peaceful,
suddenly overwhelmed, he went out as
quietly as a child dropping to sleep.
The James Montgomerys’ daughter Denise
(she prefaces the name with Adrienne on
official occasions) and the Charles Dales 5
medical son Norman started out on their
matrimonial voyage the other evening after
the sails had been set at Toorak St. John's
and the mam-brace had been spliced at No-
-9 Darhng-street. The bride, who is the
giand-daughter of Gippslalid's late pioneer
pastorahst Montgomery breathed her vows
in snowy moire silk buckled on the side with
bnlhants. A tram of rare old lace, lent by
Mrs. Stanley Argyle, floated from the shoul-
ders under the meshings of her tulle veil and
\ ept ou |. of harm’s way by Fay Stoddart
and Mrs Simon Fraser’s small daughter
Suzanne, both in mauve and pink and laden
with silver baskets brimming over with
purple blossoms. Nell Stead played a lone
hand as bride s help in mauve and silver
brocade topped by a feathered hat of the
same color.

stefim to Canada on their way back to the
Dumfriesshire property which Norman in-
herited years ago from his wealthy uncle
the late Henry Douglas. (Bose Menzies’
who looked after her brother in his gay
bachelorhood, will now anchor herself here
for a time.) Mrs. Harold Umphelby called
some of the Very Best into her Toorak pal-
lors one afternoon to meet her new sistcr-
m-law over the teacups. Mrs. Norman, who
is young and a good-looker, was in double-
tiered. hangmgs of blue and rust-red, with
embroideries on the upper deck, and slm
.laded her smile with the enveloping black
bell-shaped hat which seems to be the present
wear for every age and occasion.

Trli Knig Y S , are e °nvoying daughter
Ida to Ceylon at the end of the month to
hand her over to Lawrence Samson, of
Colombo; and on Thursday afternoon Mrs.
Knight gave a big party at the Alexandra
Club as a send-off to the bride-elect. Chatter
and music were turned on in the reception-
parlor, and afternoon tea flowed in the dining-
room above stairs. Among the musical contri-
butors was Mrs. Janson, who was Ida’s singing
mistress. It was a frightfully swish gather-
ing, and the dressing was of the very best;
7 winter hangings and the new-style clock-
shaped hat, which blots out the upper part
of the face under the glare of the electric
light, do not help to beautify a room at even
the smartest gathering. Mrs. Knight (she
was a Falkiner) richly befurred herself
under a black picture-hat dripping autumn-
tinted feathers, while ficelle braiding ram-
paged over the golden-brown skirtings below
the cape. Mrs. Jack O’Brien, the elder
daughter of the house, was in brown velvet
7™ entanglements of Oriental colors under a
little black lid that sprouted gold and brown
plumage. Her sister Ida weighted navy find
black brocade with husky fur, and mounted
a small brown hat, hailstormed with tiny
floral posies. Half the chatter was made up
ot Health inquiries— most of the guests
seemed to .have been at grips with the 'flu

Na.val-OaO_iaih Hyde’s wife was

tion for a couple ,of years. Mrs. Mcßean
was smiling in anticipation of daughter Mar-
got s return from two years oversea with her
w-n- av 7 Paymaster Reginald Egerton. Mrs.
v\ line Robertson, who is even better-looking
than her elder sister, the Grey Egerton lady,
was there; so were Mrs. Goulburn Brooke,
pretty as a picture, even though she was
among the recent invalids; the William
Xempleton widow, who is over 80 and still
able to enjoy life with the zest of 20 years
ago; heaps of Falkiner cousins and aunts,
and pretty well everyone else whose head
bobs above the surface in the social swim.

Beatrice Irving and her youthful doctor,
Gasimir . Zichy Woinarski, defied ancient
superstition with a May wedding in the Carl-
ton Catholic Apostolic Church the other
afternoon. The bride, led to the sacrifice by
her medical dad, trailed shimmery white
hangings back-curtained with snowy satin
enmeshed with gold which flushed delicately
to. a rosy linihg; and over all was the usual
misting of bridal tulle. A trio of maids—
Mab Beauchamp in green, the bridegroom’s
sister Beryl m pink, and Leslie Herman in
hlac—released a smile a minute under in-
verted bowls of black chiffon, with colored
streamers a-port. But the feminine gee-
gaws were positively outdazzled by the tailor-
mgs, spats and top hats of the bridegroom
and his three followers, Fritz Gale, Dr E
Davenport and F. Brelaz, all old Melbourne
Grammar chums, who looked as if they had
strayed down from Piccadilly. The fizz was
uncorked at No. 9 Darling-street by Dr. and
Mrs. Irving, she in grey velvet, with a plumed
hat. Ihe groom’s mother, who is the widow
of. the late Dr. Victor Zichy Woinarski,
brightened navy blue silk with Oriental
coiors. Among those around the board were
tho i ri( * e s uncle, General Irving, and his
scholastic sisters (their late professorial
cf^ was head of the Hawthorn Grammar
bchool, of happy memory), the bridegroom’s
uncle. Judge Woinarski, and many others of
the clan. And bridesmaid Beryl wore an I-
could-do-it-one-hand-kneeling sort of air when
someone remarked that she had made the
great three-decker cake with her own hands.
The old Admiralty House ballroom has
been engaged for July 9 for a jazz which
will swell the Lady North cote Free Kinder-
garten finances. It is being got up by a
swish committee which met the other day
in the Bertie Austins’ Toorak drawing-room
to map out a plan of campaign. The Kin-
dergarten wants money, and the young things
always want a dance.
The beauteous Lady Belper, who, accord-
ing to the cables, is about to take a second
matrimonial plunge, this time with a son of
Earl Rosebery, flashed briefly in the Fed-
eral limelight here with Venetia Digby be-
fore the pair flitted off with little Lady
Digby and her viscount for a peep at Japan
on their way back to England. The circling
of the globe filled in the months between
the decrees nisi and absolute which released
her from Lord Belper.
Melbourne Gaol will be empty at the end
of May, by which time staff and prisoners
will have been transferred to part of Pent-
ridge. The ugly prison is to be razed, and
as much of the stone as is suitable will be
used for building a new police depot on St.
Kilda-road to match the military barracks
alongside. On the site which fronts Rus-
sell, Victoria and Bowen streets a college
of domestic economy costing £25,000 is to
rise. The money has been paid into the
Treasury by William McPherson, who was
head of that department for six years, and
whose wife’s name will be commemorated in
the college.

Of the £13,700 left by Dr. A. W. Rinder,
clubman, Bohemian, amateur journalist and
many other things, £5OOO is to go to the
foundling hospital which has homes at East
Melbourne and Beaconsfield. Though he
tried to make _ people believe he was a ter-

talist with a particularly soft spot for the
youngsters.
Whatever the artistic merits or demerits
of the portraits of former mayors hung in
the Town Hall, the painters have, in most
instances, succeeded in bringing out good
likenesses of the originals. Those who have
known the “line” from Benjy Benjamin to
Swanson have to admit that. But the por-
trait that is the most arresting of them all
isn’t that of a mayor, but of Fitzgibbon, town
clerk and Uncrowned king of the city, who
resigned in lgfiO to take the headship of the
Water and Sewerage Board—the Privy Court=

of his property is entailed, and, though a

a matter of war-taxation, though that in
England is terrific, as. Of inroads made on his
income by others. Even when he was in
Australia he used to explain that he rarely

with this and what he can allow himself out
of the family income they should scratch
along comfortably.
A note or two from Adelaide:—
W. J. Sowden, editor for years of the Register,
but now retired, has been farewelled, on starting
foi a European trip, by the Butler Nicholson motor-
car concern, of which he is now a director. He
remains chairman of the Public Library, Art Gallery
and Museum, and has a roving commission to inquire
into such matters wherever he goes.
A new by-law of the City of Adelaide for the
regulation of boarding-houses is causing hash-ladies
a lot of worry. Newcomers absolutely won’t take

Wynette has added another Cup to the
Torr collection. Considering 1 that she has been kept
hard at work for nearly a year it seemed too much
to expect her to wm the Adelaide Cup with 9st 21b
but she danced away from the field in the final fur-
long, just as she did in the Caulfield Cup, and was

five lengths ahead of
Graculus when little
Simmons dropped nis
hands. Moreover the
time (2min. 45sec. for
1 mile 6 furlongs) was
a record for the race.
Supporters of the w'on-
derful brown mare
received £7 for every
£1 staked, and Gracu-
lus paid 6J to 1 for
second place. One can't
imagine McShortodds
laying that price
against a well-bred
three-year-old with a
10-furlongs win over
Hoppicker to his credit.
Imported Buffiine was
a close third. Stand
By never showed up.
Perhaps the St. Leger
race was enough for
him in the circum-
stances occasioned by
his Sydney accident.
There was dissatisfaction over the Adel-
aide Cup being run on a mid-week day, but tlie
crowd was still very large. What Wynette (Lord
Alwyne—Carlpedes) might have done in the Sydney
Cup can now only be guessed at. In Adelaide,
after losing by a head to Leahcim at w.f.a., she
made a runaway affair of the Cup, carrying top
weight, 9st. 21b., and coming home alone (51 lengths
was the verdict) in 2min. 45sec., which is a
record for the race—l mile 5 furlongs. She paid
exactly £7 on the Tote. Stand By was the sensa-
tion of the day. After easily winning the S.A.
St. Leger on the previous Saturday he was backed
down to odds-on in a field of 18, but he was
never conspicuous except at the back. The winner
w r as ridden by Simmons, from Melbourne, who had
the mount also when she won the Caulfield Cup.

Tattersall’s Club in Adelaide, now a
strong social body with 1300 members and £20,000
invested in Government securities, has re-elected
H. A. Morris as chairman. Also re-elected on the
CC n? m^tee were Mayor Glover, P. J. Flannagan and
Albert Goode, after a brisk contest which gave the
fourth seat to an all-round sportsman, John
Riehardscn.
A belated feed-bill was met when the four-
year-old Farceur (Absurd —Our Lady) won Moorefield
(Sydney) Handicap (1J mile) on Saturday. He
showed promise as a two-year-old in Maoriland, but
when sent to Sydney by G. D. Greenwood lost form.
Farceur is the first Absurd prad to win over a
distance.

Hosier, a five-year-old gelding by Piastre—
Silk Stocking, humped Bst. 12lb. to victory in the
Newcastle (N.S.W.) Cup (11 furlongs) on Saturday.
He had won the N.J.C. Handicap (lj mile) from
Builth and Pennybont 10 days before, and was
heavily backed. Hosier is banned from Metropolitan
courses by the loss of an eye, but there are few
better anywhere with two eyes.

The ink was scarcely dry on the A.J.C.
disqualification of O. H. Bryans in the Corncrake
case when Tom Kingsley went out for six months
over the recent effort of Lady Throstle at Kensington.
The mare had wobbled much in the betting and
had performed to match. Thomas is secretary of
the Trainers and Owners’ Association, and was one
of the leaders of the recent strike against the qlubs.

The sub-clause to forbid racehorse-doping
which Arthur Robinson, Vic. Attorney-General, has
included in the Police Offences Bill, is aimed more
at “drugs” which impede or injure than those adminis-
tered to “stimulate” or “speed-up.” However, as
the Assembly is on its last legs there is not much
prospect of the bill going through. At the next
attempt the doping anomaly should be rectified,- and
possibly one or two more racecourse clauses incor-
porated for removal.

“Lexite”: A wife suing for maintenance in
a Brisbane Court said that her husband used to tie
numbers on the necks of the ducks and chase them
across the yard. The number of the bird that reached
the fence first indicated to him which horse to back
for the big race. The system appears to have been so
unreliable that the wife and family were brought to
destitution. There is a Sydney man who stands at
a street corner every race morning, tallying off the
girls. If, say, the seventh girl who passes wears a
costume in which green and gold predominate, and
if in his race-book horse No. 7, is shown to have
green and gold colors, the tip is obvious. He
selects all his horses on this principle, and (no doubt
truly) claims that he wins as often as keen students
of form or investors who get their information
straight from the stable.
Barrackers to the number of 25,000
walked or motored to Prince’s Oval on Saturday
to see Carlton wallop its old opponents, Melbourne.
That was the expectation, but the well-trained Red
Legs, marking beautifully and playing con-
ceitedly, got a good lead and kept it, the famous
Carlton finish, which drew against ’Don and ran to
within two points against ’Roy, being smothered
at birth, so to speak. Melbourne’s goal
shooting was vile, but ite ultimate majority—lo 9
points to Carlton’s 76—w&* so large that it didn’t
matter. South, working itself iflto form, held the
Saints throughout and won with \Bl points to 53 ;
and ’Roy put the Tigers through their facings with
certainty and despatch—74 points , to Richmond’s 48
—though the State’s best full-back,. Thorpe, steadied
Moriarty so successfully that that ; enterprising youth
had his usual tally of 7 goals rfedpced to 2. ’Don
went to Geelong and played such a smashing game
that captain Barker got himself reported. The
Same Old won all through, ending with 80 points
to Geelong’s 60. \
In the third round of N.S.W. Rugby
League premiership on Saturday, * Eastern Suburbs
(last year’s premiers) were licked by Uni. Scores,
15 (3 tries, 3 goals) to 13 (3 tries, 2 goals). The
’Varsity forwards made a great showing on the
slippery S.C.G. with the brothers Dunworth and
Moxon in the van. E. J. Ryan booted all ’Varsity’s
goals. South Sydney walloped Norths by 15 to 8,
Horder and Blinkhorn (formerly of /Norths) getting
three of Sydney’s five tries. Balmain downed the
lethargic Newts by 18 to nil; and St. George
were too good for Western Suburbs —by 13 to 10.
Balmain and Glebe (6 points each) are the only
undefeated clubs, with ’Varsity a point in the rear.
***•*,
Stan Dean, who will manage the “All
Black” Rugby Union team for England, did similar
work for the M.L. team that walloped N.S.W. at
Sydney in 1922 when A. E. Beilis spun the coin.
Another man of might behind the R.U. reins this
year is Harry Frost, who has been elected president.
He has played in 40 representative matches, besides
getting a jersey for M.L. v. Queensland in 1896.
Between whiles during the past decade he has
been on the committee of the Canterbury Rugby
Union and president of the Referees’ Association.
“Centurion”: “G.R.” (B. 15/5/’24) en-
thuses about a Victorian League threequarter who
has developed “a magnificent hurdling swoop over
his opponent’s head.” The trick is as old as it is
dangerous. A. E. Stoddart was one of its earliest
exponents. Van Heerden, here with the Springboks,
tried it once or twice. A fearful crash sustained
in an attempt to clear Nothling cured him. George
Smith, of the" All Blacks, sometimes brought it off
and so did Asher, the Maori threequarter. But
the most notorious of all Australasian exploiters
of it was Barney Armit, the M.L. winger. He
eventually broke his neck in an attempt to fly
another player at Dunedin. A finger touch will
send a man somersaulting in such circumstances,
and he almost invariably lands on his head.
* * * *
“Past Grammar’s” indictment: Present in-
dications point to success for the English League
footballers who now hold the “ashes.” N. S. Wales is
particularly degenerate, as shown by last season’s easy
victories of the by no means wonderful Queensland
team. The weakness of the forward play is striking.
League football is essentially a game where tight
packing and clean heeling for the benefit of the
backs are essential. Not one N. S. Wales forward in
three packs tight or stands up to the ruck work,
with the result that a rough scrambling game pays,
as Glebe showed against the allegedly brilliant
Souths lately. The daily press “experts” have done
a lot to encourage the growth of the forward who
hangs out waiting for an opening instead of carrying
the hard work. The English pack has been specially
selected with an eye on the weaknesses developed by
the last Australian side that visited England.
* * * *
“Hasen”: I saw him at the Carlton-Mel-
bourne football match. He was small and un-
remarkable, except that at sight of him thoughts of
beer were at once induced. And then I heard him!
He was a living magna vox. In that group of
Carlton enthusiasts he easily out-shouted the loudest,
singly or chorussed against him. And his shouting
was all for the other side. Alone in its citadel he
reviled Carlton and all Carlton’s heroes. I feared
the worst, and, of course, it happened. After his
fourth fight, which he lost as easily as he had
the three others, he wds still shouting, though
naturally a little less vociferously. Later in the
afternoon I saw him again. He bore obvious marks
of manhandling, and it was reassuring to see that he
was now in the midst of Melbourne supporters.
Again that magnificent voice blared forth, but to
my stupefaction he now barracked for Carlton and
blackguarded the Melbourne lion in its den. Once
more the worst happened. Several times he bit the
dust only to rise and roar again. At the game’s
end there could have been none of him that wasn’t
sore. But his eyes were lit with satisfaction, and
I knew that I had seen the living truth of that
which says, “When one loves one’s art, no service
seems too hard.”

skipper was great at
eentreforward. His was
the clever back-pass
that enabled Thompson
to shoot the opening
goal. Masters netted
the third and fifth him-
self. Stan Bourke (out-
side right) was the
pick of the two teams
for safety, footwork
and pace. G. Ander-
son (back) and R.
Stobbart (left half-
back) were the best of
the Canadians, but
b<th were let down by
the weakness of their
forwards. The Canucks
grumbled a good deal
over the hardness of
the play.
“Centurion”: Sydney Cricket Ground
trustees have notified the Rugby Leaguers that in
future they will not be allowed to use the Ladies’
stand. The increased Cricket Ground membership is
given as the reason. As this stand is one of the
most important on the ground from the League's
point of view, the new rule will have a painful
effect on the finances; it makes three stands now
closed to them. The League people have not been so
considerate to the public or sports organisations as
to command much pity in their trouble, and the
stark action of the C.G. authorities helps to strengthen
the opinion that the arrogant professional code is
not now ruling the roost so triumphantly as of yore.

“.Johnny” Wallace, the N.S.W. Rhodes
scholar and N.S.W. Oxford and Scotland Rugger rep.,
has been selected to tour South Africa with a British
X\. The old Sydney Uni. player has been appearing
regularly in the Scottish team for the past two seasons
and is now rated as one of the best British
centres. He is the first Australian to represent
Britain, though A. B. Timms, the Scottish inter-
national who came out with Mullineux’s team in 1899,
was born in Victoria. At least two New Zealanders,
P-.P. McEvedy and A. B. O’Brien, have earned a
British cap, both with Bedell-Sievwright’s great side
of 1904.
* * * *
“Whitehall”: The epic aeroplane flights
that have been engaging the attention of the world
of late sheet home a lessen which was taught in
the war, and before it. Maclaren started from Eng-
land over eight weeks ago and is still in India: his
fellow countryman Blake took nearly a month longer
to do the same journey, and other' Britishers failed
altogether. One American has had to retire from
the round-the-world race, and though his colleagues
have ‘‘crossed the Pacific” the feat means much
less than the high-sounding phrase implies. From
the Aleutian to the Kurile Islands is less than
a thousand miles. While the Englishman was plod-
ding on his way and the American leader w r as lost in
Alaska D’Oisy, an obscure French lieutenant, rose
into the air and without preliminary puffing or a
single serious hitch reached Tokio (9250 miles from
Paris) in 80 hours’ flying time, a better performance
than the Frenchman Poulet put up some years ago.
Goble and Mclntyre almost simultaneously completed
their flight round Australia (say 9000 miles) in
about the same flying time. But the efforts of Ross
Smith and Parer—over 11,000 miles —remain un-
surpassed for endurance, initiative and skill. On
these and other performances in war and peace,
Frenchmen and Australians lead the other races as
fliers: they seem to have the same way with a machine
that an Irishman has with a horse. ' The Yanks have
never excelled, though the Wright brothers solved
some of the biggest flying problems, and neither
have the British or Germans, though both have pro-
duced extraordinarily daring fighting airmen. That
Australians should still be holding their end up at
a time when flying is practically dead throughout the
Commonwealth is little short of a miracle.
Newcastle boxers had a run of victories
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. A young heavy-
weight named Wally Walker knocked out the veteran
Dave Smith in less than a round, and two other
Novocastrians, in Bluey Jones and Eddie Tacey, also
won preliminary bouts. In the fight of the’ even-
ing Collins weighed lOst. 61b. to Bradley’s lOst. 4lb.
The Queenslander (who had secured a postponement
of the match, by the way, as he was suffering from
influenza a couple of weeks ago) rushed in at the
bell. He kept crowding his man until the fifth
round, when both stood toe to toe, and traded wallops
for the whole three minutes. This kind of thing
went on more or less till early in the 15th round,
when Collins connected with a snappy left hook.
Bradley went down for “three.” He struggled up
but was defenceless, and Collins knocked him out on
his feet. The towel then came in, and though a
few blood-crazed fools hooted Les O’Donnell for his
action in projecting it, the majority agreed that he
was right.
Lond. ’: The ’Varsity boat-race was an
experiment in crew-selection. Never before have the
been so unlike. Oxford went in for a gigantic
lot. Three men were 13 stone; one was 13st. 91b.;
and there was not a man under 12st. except stroke,
who—on the modern principle—-was under list.
Cambridge had one 13-stcne man in the middle of
the boat, with the rest evenly balanced, mostly below
12st. That is, the Oxford stroke was a stone lighter
than the Cambridge, while the rest averaged about
101 b. heavier. The big men were immensely fancied
by newspaper experts and the public, but never had
a hope when it came to the tussle.
* * * *
In Sydney University athletic champion-
ships, the outstanding effort was V. R. Harbison’s
sft. lOjin. high jump. The fraction made it a new
’Varsity record, but Harbison has done sft. llin.
as State champion. N. R. Burns (late of King’s
School) licked Jim McManamey (holder) in the
100yds (10 3-ssec.) and 220yds. (23see.). W. H.
Hutton retained the 440yds. (54sec.) ; and of the
new title-holders, W. H. Coope (880yds. in 2min.
6 l-ssec.) and R. H. Foote (120yds. hurdles in 17sec.)
showed out. The going was heavy.
A. E. P'orritt, ML. Rhodes scholar for
1922, who is now at Magdalen College, Oxford, has
just put up a great feat. With his shoulder strapped
as the result of a broken collar-bone, he ran the
hundred in a fifth above evens, his performance
getting him into the ’Varsity Olympic Games team.
“15-30”: Britain’s defeat of Belgium in
their first tie for the Davis Cup was particularly
creditable, seeing that the match was played on
asphalt, which the Belgians favor. Washer of Brus-
sels was again the star, winning both his arguments
with Gilbert and Kingscote, though Gilbert forced
him to 5 sets and 57 games before caving in. This
battle was fought in pouring rain, and Washer broke
two racquets in putting the utmost weight into his
drives, which would inevitably skid as soon as
they touched the court. His partner, Watson, failed
lamentably in both singles,' and no doubt his weak-
ness was responsible for his country’s downfall in
the doubles against the English pair, Godfree and
Woosnam. The last-named, partnered with one
of the Lowes, made a valiant effort to stop the
onrush of the Australians in the final round for the
Cup in the U.S. two or three years ago. A tenacious
rather than a brilliant player,, he poached freely
on his accomplice’s territory in an attempt to
stop a concentrated attack on that quarter, and was
duly winded but not disgraced.

Amongst the aspirants to M.L.’s sculling
championship and its £5OO purse are Darcy Had-
field (who failed against Jim Paddon for the world’s
title recently). Dick Arnst and Billy McDevitt
(N.S.W.). Paddy Hannan claims to be the present
holder by virtue of his win over McDevitt the
other day.

Dave Nourse’s 147 not out (out of 236)
v. Notts last week made, his aggregate for the
English tour 320. Since then he scored
22 and 21 against Lancashire, which leaves
him with an average of about 60. The figures are
remarkable considering that the great left-hander
was 46 on Jan. 26 last. Nourse was in England
with the S’Afriean teams of 1907 and 1912, and in
Australia in 1910-11. He is the oldest Dominion
player before the public nowadays, being a year
ahead of Warwick Armstrong, who was 45 this week.

“J.H.” (London) : Reg Bettington is now
at Bart’s Hospital with A. W. L. Row, of Queens-
land, another old Oxonian and Blue. Both played
for the Bart’s XV that recently beat Guy’s in the
Hospitals Rugby Cup. The Sydneyite is qualified
for and much desired by Middlesex, but he can’t
figure in the famous XI this year owing to exams.
He intends instead to help Bart’s in Hospital cricket.

“F.L.H.” : The recent run of boxing fatali-
ties suggests that gloves can be deadlier than the
raw-’uns—a point G. B. Shaw realised 30 years ago.
Still there were fatalities in plenty in bare-knuckle
times. The first occurred in 1788," when Earle was
killed by a blow from Tyne. The loser was drunk,
having, in the naif phrase of the day, “been working
on an election contest.” Simon Byrne killed his
opponent, Sandy McKay, in 1830, and exactly three
years later met the same fate at the hands of “Deaf”
Burke. Griffiths died after his battle with Paddy
Gill in 1850. One of Griffiths’s seconds is said to
have put an overdose of nicotine on the sponge and
then placed it on his principal’s mouth. Owen Swift
slew Bill Phelps and Anthony Noon —both fights
extended over two hours. Rarely has a boxer been
killed in the early rounds of a scrap. Exhaustion has
to be brought to the aid of Battery before Death will
climb through the ropes.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”: I know at least one
man who is a living contradiction of A.J.C. secretary
Cropper’s dictum that no money is made on the tur‘\
He doesn’t bet big, but he usually wins. He has an
elaborate chart, upon which the difference in time that
each pound of extra weight makes on distances from
six furlongs upward is worked out; and it shows,
also, the average time-differences between Randwiek
and the other courses. Every Saturday morning
he sits down with his chart and the race-book
before him, and works out by this system the chances
of the various horses on recent performances. Frac-
tional time allowances according to the position at
the post and the jockey’s riding affect the result
slightly, but on the whole it is extraordinarily reliable.
“Nollig”: Some Tassie axemen can hit fast
and hard. One of them, F. Woods, in a chop at
Forester, used only 18 blows to cut through a foot
log. The operation lasted exactly 18 seconds. Any-
one know of a better performance?
“O.McK.M.” : Queensland won’t have
things all its own way in the Uni. boatraee this
year. Judging by the fine form of the Trinitv eight
m the intercollegiate race last month, Melbourne
will be dangerous. The personnel of the Trinity
boat (reckoned the best the college has had) in-
cludes three pairs of brothers —legal knight Gar-
ran’s two lengthy sons, H. and L. Murray, and Rus-
sell and Brian Keon-Cohen. Practically every mem-
ber of the crew is a senior oarsman, five are 12-
stoners, and the younger Garran is 6ft. sin. from
hair to toe. During the last long vacation Keon-
Cohen took his crew across to Tasmania, where they
picked up experience (incidentally lifting two
trophies) which helped them to vanquish' Queen’s
in the intercollegiate final.
BEATING THE GAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Giving evidence before the Parliamentary Com-
mission on Pony Racing, A.J.C. secretary Cropper
said that he did not think any Australian made
racing pay except Ernest Clarke and John Brown.”
My punter friend who so
Assiduously dough
You wrest from Iky Mo
To Mo returnest,
Consider and acclaim
In the bright blaze of fame
Two men who beat the game,
Brown—John his foremost name-
Clarke, christened Ernest.
Marching, nay pelting, on,
They go, the gees of John,
As Fortune on them shone
With nought to stop her;
AVhile Ernest in his quest
Of stakes is just as blest
According to' the test-
imony of the est-
imable Cropper.
While other owners plot
And plan to find they’re shot
As oft as, piping hot,
Some pot boils over ;
Though bookies lambs may skin
When rank outsiders win,
They never feel chagrin,
The pair who’re always in
Financial clover.
Riches, success, renown
All wait on Clarke and Brown,
No matter who goes down
You’ll always con them
Their stakes a-garnering.
’Twould be a graceful thing—
Eh? —if a grateful ring
One of these days should spring
A statue on them.

Richard Aldridge Allen, who died the
other day, held a long-distance record. Out
of his 50 years with the Commercial Bank
of Sydney he spent 42 as manager of the
Quirindi branch. He was born in England
77 years ago.
“L. Ree”: Mt. Murchison station, sold
recently at auction on account of cattle-
king Kidman to J. Tennant, one of the S.A.
pastoral family, was in the ’eighties man-
aged by Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens,
son of. the novelist. This was the Dickens
who afterwards sat in the N.S.W. Assembly.
The railways’ wages staff contributed four
members to the new Westralian Parliament.
Three of them represent port electorates —
Albany, Bunbury and Geraldton—the last-
named having J. Willcock, who has had
Ministerial responsibility thrust upon him
in the shape of the quaintly-mixed portfolio
of Justice and Railways.
The David Syme Research Prize for 1924
has gone to the brilliant Dr. Doftus Hills,
M.8.E., for a treatise on the ore deposits of
the Speck. Plills was formerly the little
State’s Government Geologist, but didn’t get
on very well with his Minister, and resigned
after coming home from the conference of
British ex-service men, at which he was a
Digger delegate.
“Thersites”: The officials of the Sydney
Tourist Bureau are keen on advertising N. S.
Wales and its resources; one may almost
feel the Advance Australia spirit in the
very air of Challis House. Consequently I
nearly said “Godblessus !” the other day when
they handed me a beautifully illustrated book,
“Pleasure Resorts of Sydney,” and I read,
neatly embossed on the beribboned cover,
“Printed in Prussia.”
Farmer Bill Massey has a poor opinion
of politicians. When he was addressing a
meeting the other day at Invercargill (M.L.)
he related that he had just visited four parts
of his own electorate where he had not been
for 20, 12, 11 and 10 years. Somebody in-
terjected : “You must be something of a curi-
osity.” “I am,” said the Premier. “I am a
curiosity in that I hold the confidence of
many of the best men and women in the
country.”
“The Traveller”: A Bulletin advertise-
ment offering for sale a Ferrier woolpress
recalls that some of the ingenious Ferrier
family still live in the Coleraine (Vic.) dis-
trict. James, the inventor of the press, is
dead; so are John and Joseph. But Peter
and George are still on deck. All the family
were giants physically —and mentally, hi a
mechanical way. Peter was a mighty
wielder of a cricket bat in his younger days.
David, a son of Peter, after doing his bit
on the “other side,” now carries on a motor-
mechanic business in Coleraine. He, too,
is a cricketer.
Queensland’s retired and returned Agent-
General Fihelly has explained that he came
back because there was insufficient work for
an active-minded politician in London. Still
it remains on record, truly or otherwise, that
he threatened British financiers with some
real repudiation if they weren’t more civil
about the pastoral leases. Then lie hurried
across the Atlantic to meet his chief, who was
on his way to London to sing a much more
melodious song. He went, presumably, either
because he wanted to see Theodore, or be-
cause Theodore had an earnest desire to see
him. Next, Theodore said things to him —
naturally so, because it would have been
absurd to go all that way to preserve com-
plete silence. And after that Fihelly didn’t
go back to London.
“X2X”: A recent bacteriological exami-
nation of 10 samples taken from milkearts
in the streets of Sydney revealed that the
average content of micro-organisms was from
four to six million per cubic centimetre,
although 50 thousand per cubic centimetre
is generally regarded as about the limit of
safety. Considering that milk is carried
through dusty streets in tins that are seldom
effectively closed, and that often go un-
scalded for weeks, the bacterial content
might very well be five or six times as great.
Under the present system of milk examina-
tion, too much attention is paid to chemical
standards of purity, and not enough to bac-
teriological standards. It is easily possible
for a sample of milk to. comply with every
available chemical test, and yet for it to be
teeming with, millions of organisms. Yet
it is only once in a blue moon that milk
samples are examined microbiologieally.
Sydney once possessed a firm of two Jews,
•whose quarrels were the joy of the neigh-
borhood. The two were very evenly matched,
and it was just a chance whether the passer-
by was struck by Moses thrown out by Aaron,
or by Aaron ejected by Moses. Still it was
a paying partnership, and they always
patched up the difference. The partnership
of Asquith and Macdonald, who are com-
bined against Baldwin and British industry,
likewise consists largely of differences. If
there was one thing, apart from Shoddy-
trade, on which the Ramshackle Ministry
appeared to have gummed its colors to the
mast, it was the levy on capital; but when
it was knocked out there was no ill-feeling—
the firm of Moses and Aaron went on as
usual. Then Asquith produced a Propor-
tional Representation scheme, and this time
the Laborites joined the Conservatives, and
fell on it with great joy. But the firm
continues just the same.
“0.K.M.”: When “Zantlius” writes (B.
24/4/’24) “Cook charted the east coast of
Australia in a sketchy fashion, and only did
it because he thought his vessel wasn’t equal
to important work,” he is only stating half
the truth. It was Cook’s design from the
moment he left England to search for the
South Land when his scientific passengers
should have completed their observations of
the transit of Venus, and the comparative
unseaworthiness of his ship at the time of his
landfall was rather an effect than a cause of
his undertaking the mapping ,of the Austra-
lian coast. “On the western side,” so runs
the navigator’s journal entry for Wednesday,
August 22, 1770, “I can make no new dis-
covery ; but the eastern coast, I am confident,
was never seen or visited by any European
before us.” Cook’s merit is that he pro-
claimed to the world, first in history, the
possibilities of New Holland as a home for
the hardy and adventurous of the Old Land
—a title to our respect of which it becomes
none to rob him.

account of this belief, as well as from the fact that the famous Blend of

given to the Whisky which now occupies a foremost place in the market.

When it’s a question of completing an artistic temple of Commerce like the
M.U. Building with the conveniences and comforts demanded by tenants, the
quality basis comes first. First cost is the initial cost, and the ultimate saving
more than counterbalances the installation of the inferior.

Though recent operas at Melbourne
Majesty’s may have been more vocally de-
lightful, and have afforded finer examples of
individual success, “Aida” surpassed them
all for richness of presentation and chorus
effects. Pictorially the show swam before
the audience in vision on vision of ancient
Egyptian splendor. The priests in their
white-and-gold trappings, the priestesses
swaying to the beat of the music, the gaily-
colored populace and the brilliancy of the
ever-changing backgrounds provided a spec-
tacle that taxed the eye, while the ear was
being staggered by the choral embroidery of
the tale. The chorus, off-stage and on, was
consummately managed, and when it colla-
borated with the band in tremendous
climaxes the volume of sound was almost
Wagnerian. Necessarily the work of the
principals seemed somewhat small by com-
parison, but each one was satisfactory.
Augusta Concato, who was not a particu-
larly convincing Butterfly, and was too pro-
digal of feeling in the dim little character
of Micaela in “Carmen,” surprised the critics
by her Aida. Purists will complain that
there are not enough moderatos in
her reading of the part, and it may
be admitted that her tumultuous topnote
expresses an abandon not in keeping with
the score; but she was dramatic and forceful
all the same. Moreover, she was a dinkum
Ethopian, or as near to it as her regular
features would permit. As Itadames Picca-
luga had the immobility of one who had
passed with honors through the Pharaoh
school of deportment. Pie was impressively
handsome, and . much of his singing was
touched with fire, but his opening aria,
“Celeste Aida,” in which Caruso beat all
comers, was not sufficiently charged with
sweetness and yearning. Amneris was another
gold mark in the record of Phyllis Archi-
bald. Her warm contralto gave a subtle
seductiveness to a character that had already
been invested with physical glamor by her
striking personal comeliness. She eclipsed
her previous efforts, even in her sense of
drama and eloquent restraint. Grandini’s
Amonasro was vocally cast as a bearer of
sensational tidings, and his demonstrative
gestures suggested a man who was a full
admiral of his soul; but his tone was unim-
peachable and he took to the music like a
seal to water. Oreste Carozzi made an
agreeable King of Egypt, and Umberto di
Lelio was a capable head of the Sacred Col-
lege of Vulcan. He and his portly subordi-
nates provided a sumptuous study of pre-
latical dignity.
* * * *
The popular double bill of “Cavalleria”
and “Pagliacci” was advertised for Wednes-
day night, and next Saturday night “The
Tales of Hoffmann” will bring the crowd
panting for another feed of the “Barcarolle.”
At the matinee on Saturday Phyllis Archi-
bald has another innings in “Samson and
Delilah.”
** * *
“O’Kelly, Detective,” which Allen Doone
tried at Melbourne Palace on Saturday, is
a hilarious crook drama in which two gangs
of diamond plunderers believe each other to
be innocents in possession of great wealth.
Edna Keeley heads one party and Doone is
the Machiavelli of the other; but since
spoofing is the business of the evening, it is
not astounding to learn that Edna and Allen
are brilliant ’tecs, who have wormed their
way into leadership. But though wise in
other respects, the pair are blissfully uncon-
scious of each other’s identity, and when
their real profession is revealed and they
agree to join forces, enlisting their criminal
dupes as the nucleus of a new bloodhound
organisation, all previous absurdities seem
sensible by contrast. Allen Doom• is rather
lost in the swirl of events, and this paper
would welcome a reference to Erin so that
the gentle actor might warble a stave about
it. Without a melody he is bereft of a good
half of his personality. Edna Keeley is a
more noticeable feature who gets among the
gunmen by a stratagem that reflects on their
sagacity, and Ronald Riley looms up in the
background by his readiness to flourish a
cannon in argument. Among the other mis-
creants Antonio Verdi (Kevin Kerrigan)
stands out for the courtliness of his man-
ners. Despite the cut of his trousers, one is
inclined to think that he is of the old
noblesse. Next Saturday Doone promises
fresh thrills in “Q’Brian, Pirate.”
To-morrow night “The Cabaret Girl” goes
out in a blaze of Frith at Melbourne Royal.
On Saturday the same comedian will repeat
his grin in a short revival of “Kissing Time.”
"The Skin Game” looks no less untidy
and unfinished after a second inspection at
Melbourne King's. The drama is hampered
by superfluous details, and it is hard even
for Asche to keep Hornblower convincing in
the light of the circumstances that engulf
his plans.
** * *
“Tangerine" has followed “The O’Brien
Girl” at Melbourne Princess’s, and Mark
Daly is again the lord of a South Sea harem
whose garments are a challenge to the
Aurora Borealis. The revival is for a fort-
night only, but it should be long enough to
enable people to become acquainted with
some new and piquant toe-work by June
Roberts.
The Bad Boy of a Chinese family is leav-
ing a trail of unhappiness in “Thundergate”
at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week. His
methods are dark and devious, but, with the
worst intentions in the world, he performs
one good deed. He allows the hero to
annex his charming girl. Hoot Gibson, as
a “Thrill Chaser,” abandons himself to his
foolish pursuit in a headlong wonder film
at the same house. The latest romance at
the Majestic uncovers the record of “Cap-
tain Fly-by-Night," who is something of a
mosquito-by-day, but puts a few notes of ex-
clamation into the history of early Cali-
fornia. _ “Mothers-in-Law,” also on the
Majestic bill, doesn’t coincide with every
husband’s picture of his wife’s female pro-
genitor, but is not unreasonable.
Splashes of color at the Athenaeum:—
Of the Twenty Melbourne Painters who are making
their annual appeal to buyers at the Athenaeum,
George Colville shows the most definite improvement
in landscape. His canvases are impressions of rustic
peace, leaning to vividness in some cases, but fresh
in conception. Probably the best of his efforts is the
quiet Bush Pathway,” which has been tucked into
a corner. A. E. Newbury, who is remembered for
some astonishing painting in the past, seems to be
in an unhappy state of transition between Meldrumish
reticence and academic brilliancy. The result is a
sacrifice of atmosphere to color, and a suggestion of
swagger in the brushwork of which this artist was
not previously guilty. Arnold Shore’s still life, “Autumn
Leaves and Cosmos,” is a capital study of light
reflected from foliage, and his portrait of a young
man is engaging in its naturalness. The same
comment can be applied with greater force to W.
Rowell’s portrait (No. 110), which presents the
shy loveliness of a little school girl. A. M. E.
“THE SKIN GAME,” AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
The newly-rich Hornblower (Oscar Asche)
politely informs the aristocratic Ilill-
crists (Arthur Styan and Mildred Cot-
tell) that they “haven’t got the guts.”
Bale demonstrates her competence as a portraitist
in a view of a young lady in a pink silk dress. To
this writer’s way of thinking, the artist has con-
centrated on the sheen and glitter of the fabric
and left the face demanding more expression, but,
all the same, the achievement is worthy. Jo Sweat-
man’s “Girl of the Period” advertises the plump
comeliness of a well-dressed flapper, while inviting
the eye to linger caressingly on a dainty wrap near
by. W. Frater remains the Painter Laureate of
autumnal haze, but his outlook is changing, and
he is beginning to recognise the existence of the
sun. George Bell and John Longstaff are
responsible for two studies of slanting light, Long-
staff’s being conspicuous for its dashing treatment.
C. Hampel signs seven landscapes of varying merit,
John Rowell contributes a convincing bit of rough
weather, and A. Gallagher heads the rest of the
still-lifers, though C. Beckett is a very close second.
In fact, Miss Beckett’s little picture of petunias is
delightful.
“Misery and soiled tablecloths” somebody
once answered when asked his impression of
Repertory plays. Sydney’s Society lived up to
this on Saturday night when it presented its
double-barrelled bill of hopelessness. The
curtain-raiser was a Galsworthy one-acter
called “The First and the Last.” It con-
cerned two young people defying the conven-
tions in a room off Soho. The young lady
(Daphne Dean), being no better than she
ought to be, according to invariable stage
rule spoke in broken English. Only young
ladies born outside the Empire coquette with
Sin. The part wasn’t particularly suited to
the actress,- who would have been happier as
an ingenue. Her lover Larry (Frederick
Hughes) was a misfit; and when he decided
to shuffle off thid mortal coil dragging his
girl with him, everybody felt it was only
what he deserved. St. John Ervine’s “Jane
Clegg” was the second play. This concerned
an erring husband who was a liar, a thief
and a roamer after forbidden fruit. Wife
Jane (Mrs. Heath Green) in the third act
sheets all his misdeeds home to him, but only
at the cost of nearly £2OO out of a precious
legacy of £7OO that she was saving for the
children’s education. Judging by their be-
havior, Jenny and Johnny Clegg (Molly
Peters and Haz£l Slack) would have needed
every penny of it. There was something
wrong with the joints of this production: it
creaked from first to last. Everybody over-
acted, excepting John Gould as Mr. Morison
and Gregah McMahon as the bounding hus-
band. Even Albert Collins was shy of his
part, and the naughty language he had to use
was blurted out in the coyest manner. The
three acts ran to the wailing accompaniment
of old lady Clegg (Mrs. Lance Thompson).
At Sydney Majesty’s, where Gladys Mon-
crieff has been au-revoiring in “The Merry
Widow,” “Lilac Time” is due on Saturday.
The pleasantly-titled play is in its second
year at the London Lyric, whence also comes
the leading lady, Eve Linn. As in London,
Dion Boucicault is the producer.
Muriel Starr and Frank Harvey are on
the point of shaking the sand of the Sahara
off their feet,. and getting the iron of splen-
did renunciation out of their souls, at Syd-
ney Royal. “Madame X” succeeds “The
Garden of Allah” on Saturday.
“Tons of Money” finishes a clinking little
run of 12 weeks or so to-morrow night at
the Grand Opera House. Seymour Hicks
and Ellaline Terriss will then introduce
“The Man in Dress Clothes” to Sydney for
a brief season.
* * * *
“Aren’t We All?” is still impressing on
Sydney Cri. audiences the adverbial or adjec-
tival grade of old fools into which the whole
human race naturally falls.

Until Wednesday tenor Hackett was busy
gathering up Sydney gold. His season, like
the old-fashioned dining-table, seemed to have
no end of extensions. Altogether he has
given 11 concerts in the Town Hall, and all
have been crowded out. Bratza, too, is a
great favorite, and pianist Raybould is a
strong support.
The Clierniavskys will give three extra
concerts before leaving Sydney for Mel-
bourne ; and to convenience out-of-town
music-lovcrs one will be an afternoon per-
formance on Saturday. The programmes for
their fourth and fifth concerts enraptured
their admirers, and truly the Mendelssohn
trio that opened their fourth concert held
the satin smoothness and the glow of a bowl
of petunias. The Tschaikowsky trio, which
was the big ensemble work of Saturday,
found the three players at their brilliant
best. This (Thursday) evening the brothers
play again at the Conservatorium.

Wirths’ Circus is in its closing fortnight
at Sydney Hippodrome. Jugglers, seals, acro-
bats, elephants, trick cyclists, basket-bailers
and bullfighters are all working with the in-
dustry of beavers and the precision of
chronometers.
* * * *
The withdrawal of a noisy jazz band and
the addition of Grace Christie and Bert
Coote to the programme was excellent stra-
tegy on the part of Sydney Tivoli. Grace
Christie is a dancer with an artist’s soul,
who combines the graceful and the grotesque
with first-rate results. Her success is helped
by the use of cleverly constructed masks; in
turn she appears as a dignified Hindoo prin-
cess, a beautiful peacock-woman, a waddling
“Mr. Frog” and a simpering flapper. And
her straightout dancing turns are as good
as any.

Gloria Swanson is an energetic Zaza,
and Sydney Lyceum has no lack of
excitement. “The Lure of Jade” is in-
teresting the same audience. Next week
this house will make a splash with an All-
British programme—orchestra music as well
as pictures will carry the “Made in Eng-
land” brand. “April Showers,” at the Lyric,
is really a tropical storm, with shoplifting
and prize-fighting to supply the big thunder-
claps. The Globe hgs “Hearts Aflame,” and
the underwriters are not too easy about the
big forest fire that a thrill-hungry producer
has thrown into it. Second-hand furniture-
dealers are patronising the Strand, where
“The French Doll” acts as an outside agent
for a firm that palms off dud antique furni-
ture. Hoyt’s show Anna Q. Nilsson in the
garb of a male burying the sins she did not
commit in the heart of Africa, and trying
to hoist a tippler on to the w T ater-waggon.
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Will Hay as the schoolmaster of St.
Michael’s, and Noni, the musical clown.
Two Sydney shows:—
The Society of Graphic Art was born in England
of a revolt against all those modern isms that ignore
sane draughtsmanship as the foundation of art—
the sort of thing that encourages the poseur and the
incompetent to set down something like a battered
jam-tin and call it a cathedral for other incompetents
and poseurs to stand in front of and talk blithering
nonsense about. Wherefore it is an excellent thing that
the Society has sent an exhibition oversea and that
Gayfteld Shaw has been able to set it forth in his
Attic Gallery in George-street. There are a full
84 artists represented, nearly all of them by two
pictures, and their work includes etchings, dry-
points, aquatints, woodcuts, lithographs and char-
coal and pencil drawings. It is a fine collection,
remarkably varied in subject and treatment, and
in the vast majority of cases the contributors live
sturdily up to the motto “Drawing stands for
honesty in Art.” The Gallery pounced on half a
dozen.
Another show that is healthily free from affecta-
tions is that of Harold Herbert at Farmer’s Gallery.
This water-colorist recently returned after 18 months
abroad, and besides his Australian subjects he has
on view 35 pictures painted in England, France,:
Spain and Morocco, a range that interestingly shows
his capacity to meet varying conditions and problems
of light. The feature of Herbert’s work is the
forthright way he sets about his job'. Having chosen
his subject with a fine selective eye, he loads his
brush with color at full strength and goes straight
at it with no hesitation or fumbling. To achieve
success in this way is open only to the man with
a sound draughtsmanship, t ue color-sense and ability
to materialise swiftly and surely his impression of
the thing before him —and, if we overlook one or
two instances where his results are rather stark,
Herbert does achieve a very gratifying success. He
revels in sunlight, the effects of which are happily
amenable to his method, and some of his southern
European and Moroccan work shows him at his
best.
Adelaide shows have consisted largely of
good music. The South Aus. orchestra, with
Foote conducting, had the Exhibition
crowded. Charlotte Grivell, a young singer
about to depart for London with an Elder
scholarship, was warmly farewelled at the
Town Hall, and Merle Robertson, a pianist
who trod the same path several years ago,
was as warmly welcomed back. Charles Sehil-
sky, already known in Australia as an exam-
iner, has been secured as violin teacher at
the University, and showed himself at a
Conservatorium recital a fine performer.

Edmund Fisher’s tribute :■ —
Longstaff scored a bull’s-eye with his portrait of
John MacFarland, Chancellor of Melbourne University.
The picture is a fine achievement—one of Long-
staff’s best, even his masterpiece. Sitting in an
elbow chair, arrayed carelessly in gold-braided Chan-
cellor’s robe with hands folded, the kindly citizen
holds his head at ease, so to speak. The grey-
moustached veteran, his eyes half-closed quizzically,
is one of the most reposeful figures ever presented
in portraiture. One can’t give the picture greater
praise than to assert that the personality and
character of the sitter are caught and framed, and
that the portrait, which delights the Chancellor’s
colleagues with its truth, offers no evidence of his
having posed for it.

A lady settles it:—
“0.K.” (B. 24/4/’24) is right; Leake did play
Othello to Miln’s lago, I enclose. a , programme to
prove: it. My father, Hatton Keith, sang in all
Miln’s productions at Melbourne Opera House in
1889, and has often spoken admiringly of the heights
of profanity reached by Miln when things did not
go as; he wished. Incidentally, “Othello” was most
elaborately staged. In the scene outside Brabantio’s
house in Venice a canal was constructed, by sinking
a tank across the stage, and a gondola was put
together by Edwards, the boat-builder. At the
dress rehearsal, however, the craft was found too
heavy to float, so Miln arranged to have it fitted
with grooved wheels and dragged along the canal.
The rope and pulley arrangement was beautiful in
theory, but on the opening night the gondola stuck
in the canal, and the efforts of the entire company,
combined with lurid encouragement from Miln, failed
to make it budge. The slow curtain was almost
up, and the first-night audience was getting restive,
when a very jerky gondola commenced its spasmodic
journey across the stage. Dad was the unfortunate
occupant. Unfortunate, because he had to sing, and
he was hard put to it. to keep his feet when the
sturdy-fellows who worked the ropes took breath for
another haul.
One of “O.K.’s” last notes:—
“Up Stage” (B. 8/5/’24) charges me with in-
correctness in saying that Bill Deake played Othello
to Miin’s lago at Melbourne Opera House in 1889.
Though I haven’t any printed record, my recollection
is of Leake bursting forth in a flowered dressing-
gown and a tousled wig—to bid them “Silence
that dreadful bell!” I am certain that I spoke
to Miln (with whom I was friendly at the time)
about the shaggy wig. Leake was an actor rarely
seen in Melbourne in those days.
The incident illustrates the extraordinary
memory of Edmund Fisher (“0.K.”) for
even the most trivial facts about the theatre.
Perhaps it may be permissible to say that
“Up Stage” was one of Miln’s colleagues;
yet, with no scrap of paper to help it,
“O.K.’s” memory was better than the other’s,
as a programme since forwarded to. this
office proves.
“Country Ped”: The other night, at the
Port Melbourne picture theatre, 4000 ft. of
film blazed up, causing a stampede which
resulted in one woman being badly injured.
The panic in this case was foolish, for the
machine-room is fireproof—a precaution in-
sisted on by the Board of Health. But.
throughout the country touring shows exhibit
in halls which are merely unlined
pine shells. The machine is put on a
couple of boxes, and copper wires convey
the necessary current from the dynamo out-
side. If a wire should fuse, or a film
catch fire, with the projector placed at the
back of the hall right against the main
entrance, the audience would have a poor
chance of getting out. The small door at the
rear of the stage is utterly inadequate. The
Vic. Education Department refuses to allow
picture-shows in its schools without a writ-
ten guarantee that non-inflammable films
will be used. The Board of Health should
insist on travelling showmen doing likewise,
or else order that country halls, like town
ones, must be equipped with fireproof
operating chambers.
“D.W.”: When will Australia revolt
against the tyranny of the American film?
I went to see “A Woman of Paris” the other
night. Set round about New York it
would be all right; placed in Prance it is
all wrong. . For a young Frenchman to tell
a French girl that they will go up to Paris
next day and be married shows Charlie
Chaplin’s utter ignorance of French law and
custom. Nor can Edna Purviance’s skill—
aided by the famous chinchilla mantle—even
for a moment give the illusion that she is a
Frenchwoman. To those who know France
the whole thing is ridiculous; to those who
do not it gives false impressions. Now in
Pans they’ve been filming a story of Napole-
onic times. One of the greatest living
authorities superintended the production, and
French museums lent furniture of the
period. That picture can be seen with
pleasure by artists and men of learning, and
will at the same time make simple folk
realise the past as history books cannot do.
But we in Australia will never see it. Why
not? What an education it would be if we
could see French and German and Italian
acting once in a way! And how it might
help to pave the path to better understanding
—and Peace ! —if we could have true pictures
of the lives lived by people of other nations!
From Thameside:—
Maud Fane and Vera Pearce have very small parts
in “Leap Year” at the Hippodrome. In some of the
first-night notices they were not mentioned at all,
but one critic praised their handling of the little
they had to do. Perhaps their roles wall grow a
bit —it sometimes happens in revue.
Sutro’s “Far Above Rubies” was roughly handled
by the critics. Marie Lohr was bluntly told by one
scribe that “her part is dead,” and that it is
“beyond her power to bring it to life.” Others
complain that the gowns she wears are far costlier
than the character she represents—a civil servant's
missus would sport in real life. However, all the
writing men have a kind word for Marie Tempest.
“Ooriolanus” has been revived by Lilian Baylis at
the. Old Vic. It has hitherto ranked as about the
least attractive of the Bard’s productions. Irving
put it on during his reign at the Lyceum, but had to
take it off much sooner than he had anticipated ; and
all that is remembered of his season is a yarn. The
placards ran thus: “Ooriolanus, Sir Henry Irving;
Scenes and Costumes, Sir L. Alma-Tadema, R.A. ;
Incidental Music, Sir Alexander MaeKenzie.” Where-
upon Props, the pessimist, was overheard to remark:
“Three bloomin’ knights! And that’s about as long
as it’ll run.”
Preliminary puffs notwithstanding, there is nothing
particularly fresh or original in Shaw’s treatment of
the Maid of Orleans theme in his “Saint Joan.” He
sticks pretty closely to recorded facts and tradition,
but he has certainly turned out a striking historical
play. Walkley, of the Times, though objecting to the
introduction of such terms as “howler,” “military
dugout,” and “deliver the goods,” affirms that “Saint
Joan” will rank as one of Shaw’s finest achievements.
Sybil Thorndike, now recognised as the leading
London actress, is a beautiful and thrilling Joan.
The Variety Artists’ Federation has removed the
ban on its performing brethren in Germany and
Austria. The reasons given are curious, viz., (1) “the
large amount of unemployment among variety artists
in Britain,” and (2) “an eager demand in the late
enemy countries for British music-hall people, at
salaries ranging from £2O to £7O per week, and
payable in pounds sterling or American dollars.” Yet
I suppose soft-headed galoots are still cadging in
Australia for “starving” Germans.
“Westral” : Strange how Perth is neglected
by the J.C.W.’s, Taits and Ward-Fullers.
Except for Wilkie, and now a modest com-
bination of |Grieg-Holloway with Yankee
farces, nothing has disturbed the spiders
and dead tinsel of the Perth theatres for
many moons. When the Jarrahland capital
was half its present size, not only the Firm
but Billanderson, Blandolt and many toe-
twirling companies found it a good show-
town. There are snatches of vaudeville, but
not the best. In years gone by the Swan-
side city was included in the itinerary of
such as Cinquevalli and Little Tich, but
nowadays it has become a jumping-off place
for the jazz-tabby and the red-nosed com-
edian who have used up the effete East.
“F.L.H.”: Why do contemporary operatic
producers leave Weber’s “Oberon” on the
top shelf? There are plenty of fine solos
and good concerted numbers in the melo-
dious old piece. Lyster staged it in 1864 at
Sydney, and in 1865 at Melbourne Royal,
with a cast which included Lucy Escott,
Rosalie Durand, the Squires, Beaumont and
Fred Lyster—the chorus numbered 451 The
“Oberon” overture is still popular, but the
only complete performance of the opera since
then was a platform arrangement in Mel-
bourne Town Hall about 20 years ago, under
the baton of Charles Levy.
“Hamfat”: There is fine photography in
the film that Ray Longford made for the
Commonwealth Government, which is pre-
sumably showing it at Wembley. Certainly
the story is not up to the standard of the
real-life pictures which it pieces together—its
character is fairly well indicated by the
tripey title “ ’Neath Australian Skies.” Still,
a great many worse stories have been im-
ported from Hollywood, and have gone down
with audiences supposed to be intelligent.
Neither have they been ridiculed by a paper
which claims to be “Above all for Australia,”
and which turned one of its funny men on
to “do” the Australian film.
“Portcullis”: Alfred Maguenat is about
the only man with the J.C.W. opera co.
who has sung at the New York Metropolitan.
He has also had six successive seasons with
the Chicago Opera Co., and has been heard
with Melba in “Faust” and “Romeo and
Juliet” at Covent Garden. A few years
back he tried the rdle of Mark Antony in
Massenet’s version of Shakspeare’s “An-
tony and Cleopatra” in the 'premiere of
the opera at Monte Carlo. Maguenat has
a big French reputation for his rendering
of the father in Charpentier’s “Louise,”
which, by the way, deserves a place in the
Firm’s repertoire in preference to, say, “II
Trovatore.”
Edmund Fisher, the oldest inhabitant on
The Bulletin’s literary staff, died in Mel-
bourne last week, aged 70. Asthma had for
several years greatly distressed him, and he
had spent long periods at Daylesford and
elsewhere trying to escape from his tor-
mentor. For some weeks past he had been
exceptionally well. Then heart-failure com-
plicated an attack, with a fatal result.
Mr. Fisher had made the theatre his
specialty, and for just over 50 years had been
very closely connected with it. His know-
ledge of the history of the stage was extra-
ordinarily wide and intimate, and his mem-
ory amazing; as “0.K.” and “Fax” he must
have written some thousands of “Poverty
Point” paragraphs in the paper which he
served always faithfully and often brilliantly
for over 40 years. ITis judgment, rein-
forced by his vast experience, was always
sound; and his criticisms were invariably
salted with humor. For more than a quarter
of a century he covered the whole field of
EDMUND FISHER.
Melbourne theatres ; and though his infirmi-
ties in later years demanded that he should
do much less, he still looked forward with
great joy to any large theatrical event, and
he insisted on attending every first-night of
the grand-opera season to the day of his
death.
Until about 20 years ago Mr. Fisher wrote
much verse, and published one volume of it;
his “Billiard-marker’s Yarn” was perhaps
the most widely popular thing he ever wrote.
During the last few years, with more leisure,
he returned to his old love, and wrote a
good deal for his paper and more for his own
amusement. In spirit he had never grown
old: there was youth and gaiety in all his
work until the end.
He was a genial old philosopher who occa-
sionally made a poor pretence of being a
grim cynic; an inveterate optimist; as a
critic, in every way incorruptible; and tens
of thousands besides his colleagues will miss
him sadly. *
“Orb” : It’s five years since we liad grand
opera from the Firm in Sydney, and Gertrude
Johnson, Amy Castles, Strella Wilson and
Nellie Leach were then the prime donne.
Vera Bedford was also in that, as she is in
the present co. They did “Rigoletto,”
Madame Butterfly,” “Lucia di Lammer-
moor, ‘Faust,” “Cavalleria Rusticana” and
I Pagliacci.”
Dora Wilcox recalls Duse:—
I saw Duse three times. First, long ago, in the
Italian version of “La Dame aux Camellias,” a piece
which, in spite of sentimental and melodramatic
fustian has yet in it something of eternal interest.
It had in it something of moral value as well, since
it taught the virtuous Victorian women to realise
that their sisters who had embraced the oldest of
all professions were human beings, too, with thoughts
and feelings. Duse, even then, was not young. She
could never have been beautiful. Moreover, she dis-
dained stage make-up. But her genius, expressed
through that dark, mobile face, through eyes and
voice, through every movement of her body, and
through those hands—-those wonderful hands of
Duse!—thrilled and gripped even those to whom
her language was imperfectly known. in
La Seeonda Moglie” (“The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray’’), which she played in London with a full
Italian company, she was not so successful. Mrs.
Patrick Campbell was a more convincing Paula, and
she made credible that one-time friendship with
Lady Orreyd. Duse did not—nor, for that matter,
does Miss Irene Vanbrugh. Duse’s Paula was of too
fine a fibre; moreover, there is too much purely
British sentiment expressed in the play to make it
suitable for representation by Italians, whose outlook
on life is so different. The third time I saw her
w’as as Magda in Sudermann’s “Heinath.” She was
older then, and permitted herself to make up a little
for the stage. In that part she was superb; she
was not Duse, nor an actress ; she was Magda her-
self. When I think of it I can still see her, I
can still hear the passion of her voice. There has
never been in our time so wonderful an artist. No,
not even Bernhardt.
“Paree”: Two fresh theatrical attempts
are being made in Paris to cater for the
many Americans and Britishers who like to
feel at home when away from it. The
Alhambra puts up a regulation music-hall
show on London lines, and a stock co. calling
itself the Dramahouse Players is just starL
ing with Milne’s “Dover Road,” with “A Bill
of Divorcement” and Sutro's “Laughing
Lady” to follow. This co. pluckily talks of
giving O’Neill’s “Emperor Jones,” which fell
flat lately when tried on Paris in a French
translation.
“Lond” : Elinor Glyn’s “Three Weeks” has
been passed for the screen by the English
censor, in a disinfected version, with the
further condition that the now notorious
name shall be changed. So it becomes
“The Romance of a Queen.” Its publicity
department boldly claims it as “a sincere
modern treatment of the old matriarchal
theme of a queen seeking, on her people’s
behalf, the fittest father for their future
sovereign—probably the story of the Queen
of Sheba, and certainly that of Cleopatra.”
“0.K.” : In a recent reference to a revival
of “London Assurance” the comedy was
credited to Dion Boucicault the elder, as
though it were an accepted product of that
prolific melodramatist. The plot was John
Brougham’s : and when Madame Vestris anu
Ben Webster bought the comedy it was on
terms which required the young author to
pay half his share of the proceeds to
Brougham. As a comedy-w r riter on his own
account, Boucicault never did anything as
original as “London Assurance” appeared to
be in its day. And it had a long day.
“Pax”: Melbourne’s Repertory co. feels
extra pleased with itself since the produc-
tion of Galsworthy’s “Loyalties.” The season
clashed with the first week of the grand-
opera boom, nevertheless three nights' re-
ceipts beat the best that the Repertorians
had done under previous conditions as “Mer-
maid” Players. It was their brightest and
least amateurish performance, and would be
certain to draw good audiences for another
series of three, nights if Melbourne Playhouse
were an inviting place of entertainment.
But theatregoers in general have never been
there to see what sort of bloomin’ show this
Repertory Co. gives, nor will the crowd ever
go there. Besides, a big crowd couldn’t get
in if it went.
“T.P.”: Re poor Bill Leake, tragedian
and stock actor of the far-back (B. 8/5/’24).
Long ago I saw him play Macbeth in Mel-
bourne Royal. Years afterwards, the inter-
val having mostly been spent in the theatre-
less bush, I turned into the old Royal for a
Bland Holt mellerdrarmer. In the opening
scene, a London park, a drunk snoring on a
garden seat was rooted from his nest by a
bobby. “Garn outer this,” the minion of
the law commanded, shaking the helpless
bag of bones by the collar. With quivering,
hoarse, broken voice and limbs shaking in
alcoholic, senile decrepitude, the actor pro-
tested and shambled off. That was his
only bit, and it was fine. Something in his
voice plucked at a chord of memory, and I
slipped out to consult a doorkeeper. It
was Leake! His throat had become diseased
—and Bland Holt had added his name to the
lengthy list of actors down and out whom
he helped in and out of season.
“Royce Rolls” : What names these opera-
tic artists wear! The J.C.W. co. includes
a Hamlet (he is the prompter), an Orestes,
an Apollo, a Carmen and an Aurora or
their Italian equivalents. And there was a
rather undersized member of the Gonsalez
co. wfiiose doting parents had had him
christened Ercole (Hercules'). When I saw
him toying daintily with a plate of spaghetti
I thought Ercolito would have been suffi-
cient.
“Dido”: Rignold, showing at Melbourne
Royal, had in his company the veteran
Horace Overcote, who, to the intense chagrin
of Horace, was playing small parts. Mr.
Overcote realised the folly of kicking against
the pricks, but when he was cast to play an
old virago in one of Rignold’s melodramas
he ventured a protest. “Perhaps you do not
know that I have played Hu-hamlet in me
time?” he inquired. “Sir,” was the thun-
dered riposte, “if I had not seen you play
Hamlet would I, think you, have guessed
your capacity for old-woman parts?”
WHY, INDEED!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
. ® ne . the slides depicting patients before and
. i e monkey-gland operation showed an elderly
Englishman appearing feeble to the point of senility,
with eyes faded, teeth missing, face wrinkled, and
sagging muscles. After treatment he appeared witli
a smooth face, clear eyes—almost an Adonis.”
His ears are of coral, his lips they are red,
His hair it is curling all over his head ;
His figure is dapper, his waist very small,
With brains it would seem lie’s not bothered at all.
He is prettily dressed from his head to his feet,
His coat is close fitting, his linen is neat;
As a wonderful cure he is put upon show—
The women say “My!” and the girls murmur “Oh!”
His tootsies are pearl-pink and smooth are his hands,
A perfect Apollo before us he stands;
But we cannot conjecture, we’re blessed if we can,
Why they spoiled a good monkey to make such a man!

Wash your face in warm water,
and while the skin is still damp
lightly smear a little pure mercolized
! wax over your face and neck, and
| leave on until the morning. After a
few nights of this treatment the
blemishes on your skin should dis-
appear.
Mercolized wax dissolves away
the old, dry skin and leaves behind
a new, healthy complexion. Beauty
is but skin deep—mercolized wax
brings it to the surface. It is empha-
sised that this wax is quite harmless,
and contains only the purest ingre-
dients, being free from any poison-
ous mercury salts.
The meaning of the word “mer-
colized” is “active,” and its activity
is obtained from its oxygen content,
which is Nature’s own beautifier. As
a general facial cleanser mercolized
wax is unequalled, being in universal
everyday use by up-to-date, dis-
criminating women. Husbands also
find it beneficial for use after shav-
ing, especially if the skin is chafed.
It should always be used before the
application of powder, as the wax
will prevent the pores of the skin
from becoming clogged and un-
healthy.
All Chemists can supply you with
pure mercolized wax, in neat,
original tins, containing sufficient to
last from six to eight weeks. Price,
5/6 per tin, or post free from

Nervous Dyspepsia
among Business Men.
Doctors find a great deal of this
complaint existing among men of
affairs. It is traceable to the increased
business worries and anxieties—living
too close to work.
Mental depression, due to over-
strain, is prevalent. In these cases,
digestive exhaustion follows closely
upon nervous exhaustion.
There is no better treatment
jp — than the digestive rest so
easily obtained with Benger’s
Food. Taken as a supper dish, its
soothing qualities induce restful sleep.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
New Guinea: Better than that can be got
out of any good cyclopaedia... .J.8.W.: Doesn’t earn
its space... .Sucre: Try that line again. It is pro-
mising.... Pa Ariki: The Bulletin doesn’t deal in
reprint... .W.D.: Impossible to sub-edit such closely -
typed stuff... .Petunia: You took a suitable pen-
name, anyhow. You do strangle.:. .J.S.D.: That
well has been pumped dry.... Caesar: “Vision” is an
improvement; but “ventures”-“benches” is a dread-
ful rhyme Aye Aye: Nothing fresh in the matter;
and the manner is heavy. Shorten your sentences.
. ...E.V.R.: Yes, of course, and foxes are a national
asset, too —people make a few pounds out of their
skins sometimes.... Emeritus: The point isn’t sharp
enough to push it through. .. .R.8.F.: And we’re not
very sure that R.L.S. isn’t largely the wreckage of
Scott Suiteffe: No W.M.W.: Too labored
H. Pannikin: But you won’t get people to swallow
a yarn like that unless you give them numbers and
names.... Ripponlea: It has a delicate movement: —•
When winds croon
And a nocturnal fowl
Croaks ’neath th’ moon,
’Tis then soon
’Round chimney and cowl
Feline fauna gyrate and do howl.
As enthusiastically he crieth,
From his roost th’ deluded rooster flieth ;
A motor-light if he spieth.
In myst ious manner,
A melodious tenor
Voice doth sing;
Then a sharp sting;
A loud smack,
With hard impact.
So despairing
I mop my brow
Coffee’s a cow,
I know!
I’ll take an aspirin!
And so in bliss
Th’ pillow with my ear do I kiss.
.... J.H.N.; Weak and thin. . . .James S.: No use to
u5....C.M.A. There’s a small idea, but the verse
is too rough... .Mavis: Flutters feebly.... 11.A.M.:
The “Rabbiter” is a dull sort of person and the
yarn gets nowhere... .F.S.A.: Doesn’t make us waut
to shout. .. .S.M.A.: A sonnet needs to be something
more than a mere arrangement of rhymes. Try
simpler forms first. .. .L.L.S.: The same weary old
stuff that has been done so often. .. .11.M.5.: That
yarn is told regularly once a fortnight... .P.F.J.:
Nothing there... .W.M.S.: Have had it analysed for
mirth, but can’t get a trace of it.... Lucy D.:
“Evening Fantasy” only repeats the old things, and
they have been often better said.... The Cynic:
As thin as hominy.... L.S. A.: Rotten.... J.F. (Gee-
ling): Our opinion of it is not printable....
A.McG.: It has the quality of directness and a
certain bold simplicity:—
The lad when courting his little girl,
May have trouble on his way;
He may have a kiss, then pull her curls,
Then his girl may growl and say:
“It is Time you thought of what you do,
And took notice of other’s Feelings;
For I never hurt, or tickle you,
When I find you in a bad humor.
In Arm and Arm they may walk the path,
Anl perhaps go to the fancy plays,
When there they may talk, and have a laugh,
Then think the facts look gay.
When the girl gives consent to be his wife
Their Courting days are near over;
When married, it is good, if they keep from strife,
And can be the Best of Lovers.
.... Dodo: The mirth is hard to find.... J.A.11.:
Heavy and sodden.. . .Edward E.: The rhymes are
bad, the lines won’t scan, and the idea has whiskers
‘as long as Abraham’s... .P.S.W.: The yarn has some
qualities, but not enough good ones. ... D.M.A :
“.Shell Gatherers” is too thin....M.P. (North Syd-
ney) : It falls over its feet too often.... Gertrude S.:
It hasn’t enough point... .L.E. (South B.): We
don’t reprint. —D.F.A.: The same old yarn in the
same limping verse... .W.W.S.: There have been
worse first attempts.... Senex: Nothing in it....
J.F.M.; No use for leng screeds about nothing in
particular J.S.M.: Thanks. But we would rather
have it in decent verse.... Coles It.: No interest in
it. .. .S.M.A.: Doesn’t strike us. . . .Q.R.M.: Not up
by some distance... .L.L.L.: Pretty enough in its
way, but no lift in it.... The Nark: That same
pommy has been riding that horse in the same splen-
did way for 20 years.... J.M.M. Leaves us very
c01d... .A.F.A.: Hundred per cent, melodrama....
J.N.A.: The verse wobbles and wallows, and gets to
nothing worth while... .Veni V.V.: The verse creates
at the joints. Get out your oil can... .L.O’S.: The
sun generally rises, but there seems no reason why
the fact should be stated in eight stanzas....
Mary M.; You’re on the road; keep going....
D.R.A.: Too long for its small interest.... Fred J.:
An old yarn poorly handled. .. .W.S.D.: You might
sell it elsewhere... .B.F.AV.: Not nearly. .. .S.T.I.
(and 300 others): Thanks, thanks. The man who
wrote (B. l/5/’24) that Massie was the only sur-
vivor of the 1882 Australian XI has been boiled in
lead... .M.V.A.: The subject of “adjectival padding”
has been exhausted; but you hit the originil writer
hard with one couplet:—
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.
. ...A.S.D.: The Speakership of the Commons is not
one of the “spoils of office,” nor is it “in the gift
of the Prime Minister.” When a Speaker dies or
resigns his successor is chosen by Parliament, and
is therefore likely to be the nominee of the dominant
party, but once there he is regarded as being there
“for keeps,” though he must be re-elected with every
new Parliament.... Tom F.: Your “rummage”-
“plurrnge”-“homage” rhyme is pretty desperate;
and the rhyme is ’most everything in verse of that
kind Oh My: Finish it as well as you began it
and it will be first rate.... Jacques: It was worth
only a paragraph, anyhow Mena M.: You’ve
overloaded it with characters.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
M.S.: Gentleman with leaves in his hair barred.
...8.8.-D.: What’s it all about, anyway?....
W.A.H.: Doddering old gags. E.M.8.: Feeble little
imitations of Betty Paterson. .. .W.R.: Drawing much
below the mark.... R.G.: An eloquent example of
how not to do it....W.N.: Gag a bit too sea-sicky.
... .R.D.M.: If, as you say, Art is drawing you,
then beware—the hussy has got hold of your leg.
A.E.: Awful C.W.: Drawing faulty and treat-
ment stiff.... PAY.; Stop it... . LL.M.: A tragic
attempt to be funny... .8.D.T.: A self-respecting
sheep would bite a shearer if he handled it like that.

“Ignoramus” : It isn’t only in backblocks
pubs you may find a gold coin re-
garded with distrust. The other day
in Auckland I tendered a half-sovereign
and a shilling in payment for some theatre
tickets. The girl at the window kept on in-
forming me that the price was 11s., and when
I had succeeded in impressing on her that
this was precisely what I was offering, she
closed the argument by declaring that she
wasn’t allowed to accept half-sovereigns.

“Veedee H.” : People who have had to pay
£lOOO for a new cottage honestly worth £4OO,
and wait three months for the not-mucli-
workmen to finish it, will be so glad to hear
that at Miramar, a suburb of Wellington, a
new Methodist church, capable of seating 100
persons, was built in a recent day. An ex-
pert builder directed the operations of a
horde of volunteers, and a plumber attended
to his side of the business. Work com-
menced at dawn, and the last nail was driven
just as darkness arrived.
“Dido”: The Melbourne suburbanite was
explaining to a carload of visitors the reli-
gious facilities of the Mechanics’ Institute.
“In the morning,” said he, “the Roman
Catholics hold early mass. Later the Pres-
byterians hold worship. In the afternoon
the Methodists hold prayer-meetings, and in
the evening the Anglicans hold service.”
“And my poor, persecuted people alone are
unrepresented,” wailed a Jew. “Oh, that’s
quite all right,” was the immediate retort;
“they hold the mortgage.”
* . * * *
“Cobba-Cobba” : E. Sanders, who has been
fishing for the past 25 years along the Bar-
rier Reef, has obtained a permit from the
Queensland Government to use a special
close-meshed net for the purpose of catching
sardines, anchovy and whitebait. He will
use Green Island, 20 miles east of Cairns,
as his base. The waters of the Barrier Reef
in season swarm with the small fish ; if the
supply can be successfully exploited there
will be no need for the enormous quantities
of sardines, etc., annually imported into the
Commonwealth.
* * * *.
“M. 8.”: Lester Way, in his ingenious
plea (B. l/5/’24) for the elevation of sales-
manship to a niche amongst the arts, over-
looks the feature of it which vitiates his
case. That is its prevailing insincerity. The
salesman’s business is to convince people
that his goods are the best value on the
market. The odds are heavily against his
claims being correct, but to admit that even
to himself would be fatal. The salesman
may find some pleasure in his pursuit, but
the pay’s the thing! He would hardly do liis
job without monetary reward, as musicians
have been known to compose and authors
to write.
“Mirrool” : An absurd position was recti-
fied in the Murrumbidgee irrigation area a
few days ago when the Leeton hydro and a
Griffith pub were simultaneously licensed, on
appeal by Judge Bevan. B’or years the only
alcoholic* liquors glimpsed by the poorer
residents of the areas were the impressive
cargoes brought up by official picnic parties.
The necessity of going to Narrandera for a
beer was one of the things that embittered
poor Henry Lawson against the dry area.
With a licensed inn, Leeton, which presents
all the year round the oasis-like beauty of
a Nile-side orangery, ought to develop into
a tourist resort.
* * * *
“X2X” : The yarn about the German manu-
facture of high explosives from the Austra-
lian grass-tree has been revived. It
originated in that hysterical war-period when
prominent German residents were daily being
shot as spies on Garden Island and hidden
wireless plants abounded in every suburb.
The only substance of an explosive nature
contained in grass-tree ig picric acid, which,
when combined with a base to form a picrate,
is capable of doing some damage. But there
is so little of it in the plant, and it is so
easy and simple to make it in large quanti-
ties by other processes, that nobody but a
lunatic would dream of utilising grass-tree
for the purpose. What the Germans actu-
ally did with the stuff was to extract from it
several useful vegetable dyes. Of late years
the material has again been leaving this coun-
try * n increasing quantities, nominally for
Holland and Sweden, but actually, of course,
for Germany.
* & # d
“Bogong”: P.M.G. Gibson is in a quan-
dary about wireless broadcasting. A year
ago he called a conference of people inter-
ested and asked them to evolve a scheme.
They did. Proposals were put forward—•
and subsequently adopted by Gibson—pro-
viding for competitive broadcasting instead
of the practice in Britain, where one repre-
sentative company supplies the programmes
through eight stations. To ensure the suc-
cess of the competitive principle the Austra-
lian conference provided for sealed receiving-
sets, so that the person who bought sets from
Brown-Jones could listen in to only Brown-
Joness programme, unless, of course, he paid
c^ r ‘ l : The public showed its disapproval
of this limitation by abstaining from buving
the sealed sets in any numbers. Now you can’t
successfully run a business concern unless
you have a public which will buy; so the
wireless people held another conference re-
cently and proposed some more regulations,
including the abolition of sealed sets. The
natural consequence of this will be the
establishment of a co. like the British Broad-
casting Co., or, at any rate, some common
understanding among the licensed broad-
casters. Gibson put up the suggestion of
one company, and argument is revolving
around the probable effects, injurious or
otherwise, of a monopoly. This much is
clear: Twelve months ago the P.M.G. asked
the people who should know all about broad-
casting to supnly him with a scheme. As a
result Australia is in a worse position to-
day than it was then, because not only is a
fresh start necessary, but seven firms who
have received licenses have to be placated.

REPRESENTATIVE IN NEW SOUTH WALES:
Messrs. ARMSTRONG-HOLLAND, 4 Bridge St., Sydney, N.S.W.
SEND FOE OUi: ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE No. 20.
“Zanthus”: Tlic founder of the Swan
River colony, Captain Stirling, proposed to
inflict on the country the name of Hesperia.
It escaped that; but what it got wasn’t
much better.
“Veedee H.”: If “Adamascus” (B.
24/4/’24) really wants to see some bicycles
he should step across to Christchurch
(M.L.). Estimate puts the grids between
30,000 and 35,000, which is not bad for a
population of about 90,000.
“P.M.’s” society item :
At a fancy-dress ball in Gippsland recently a
prize was offered for the best representation of a
song. The local wit came carrying a kerosene-tin
filled with a brand of fertiliser extensively utilised
in suburban gardens. He didn’t get a prize, how-
ever—he was peremptorily ordered out, and his goods
with him. The exhibit was supposed to represent
“Where My Caravan Has Rested.”
“Alastor”: The yarn goes that Bishop
Frodsham, once of North Queensland and
now in England, visited Muttaburra, a
C.Q. town with 300 souls and six pubs, and
while there was asked to have a fatherly
word with an old lady who was imbibing
too freely and wasting her estate. He paid
the erring one a call, and after some plea-
sant conversational sparring, ventured,
“Madam, I have been told you drink.” “Yes,
my Lord,” was the quiet reply; “and I
aits, too.”
Claude A. Ronald, born 84 years ago on
the present site of the Melbourne Argus,
has departed at Tallangatta. He attended
school in Melbourne with his first cousin,
G. 11. Reid. “George was fairly smart at
school,” Ronald used to say, “but was too
willing to play the wag, earning shillings
by holding horses; and although he was a
stoutisli lad nobody thought he would run
to fat like he did in N.S.W.” The old pioneer
lost two sons at the war. Up till a few
months ago he rode a young horse which
would have been a problem to any ordinary
man.
James H. Watson, who for a generation
has been an authority on Australian history,
was moved recently to correct a confusion
of identity between two remote and unre-
lated Sydney characters bearing his own
name. Watson’s Bay was named in 1811
after Robert Watson, a seaman on the
Sirius, who was afterwards made signalman
at North Head. He died in 1819. Captain
Thomas Watson, who lived in the house
which afterwards became John Robertson’s,
made liis first appearance in Sydney history
. in 1839 and died in 1879. He erected in
the grounds of his residence in Belmore-
road at Randwick the first statue to Captain
Cook in N. S. Wales. It was unveiled in
1874.
“Numbugga”: “S.C.’s” Chinaman, Jack
Booshang (B. l/5/’24), kept a general
store at Adaminaby (N.S.W.), not a hotel;
moreover, he is still alive and in the same
old building, though he is now over 90 years
of age. He reared a big family, one of
whom, Jimmy, was a fine jockey in his day.
Also he bred many good racehorses. In his
early years Jack figured in the Lambing
Flat riots, where he lost his pigtail, and
later on settled in Adaminaby, where he has
resided ever since and enjoyed universal
esteem. Iviandra, by the way, could once
boast of an excellent hotel kept by an
Assyrian married to a half-caste Chinese
girl, who proved to be one of the finest host-
’ esses of Monaro.
“C.G.C.” : The most remarkable individual
I met in the A.I.F. had drifted from an
Aussie battalion into the Egyptian Camel
Transport. An obscure pub in Assiout was
the scene of our introduction. My new
acquaintance’s linguistic ability—he spoke
six European languages and had a ready
command of Arabic —so impressed me that
the first day we met I inquired his profes-
sion. “Just war,” lie. said. He had spent
most of the last 20 years in one European
army or another. When he got bored with
one set of combatants it was his nonchalant
habit to join up with another. In the course
of his military career he had fought for
Greece, Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria and Rou-
mania. Sydney was his birthplace.
“Simon”: Jim Tyrrell, vice-president of
the A.L.P. in N.S.W., and, as sec. of the
Municipal Employees’ Union, about the best-
paid trade-union secretary in Australia,
hasn’t always been Labor. In the days
when R. D. Meagher was given to upsetting
Labor pots by running as an Independent,
Tyrrell was his henchman, and acted as his
secretary when he got within a few votes of
victory for Surry Hills. That was the time
E. W. O’Sullivan, as stakeholder, capsized
everything by handing up to the Speaker
John Norton’s resignation written in bluff.
A real Surry Hills election followed, and in
a badly-split vote, the Liberal, present Min-
ister for Education Bruntnell, got his first
look in. But Tyrrell had the satisfaction of
knowing that his man had outed the selected
and endorsed Labor candidate, Harry Law-
ton, the sacked Tramway Union official.
“C. McL.” on an ex-Chancellor:—
“Library Lizard” (B. 24/4/’24) makes a timely
reference to the fine library that the late Dr. Mac-
Laurin, so long Chancellor of Sydney Uni., had in
his house in Macquarie-street. A professional librar-
ian used to call every few weeks to keep it :n
order; but when MacLaurin was about 68, the
first gloom of the slowly approaching end began to
affect him, and he bought few books in latter years.
He preferred to borrow from the Parliamentary
Library. His tastes were faithfully shown in his own
books, which consisted of great numbers of works
on Scottish life and history; accounts of Greek and
Latin literature, including innumerable rare and
valuable editions of Latin poetry; Renaissance books
and books of philosophy. On the whole, he was the
most truly learned and cultured man I have ever
met, full of wise saws and learned instances. If a
particular fact had escaped his amazing memory he
could always tell you exactly where it was to be
found, and would often gravely repair to his full
book-shelves lest you should entertain the incredible
suspicion that possibly he might be exaggerating.
* He used to say that he owed his taste for books to
his early education at St. Andrew’s University; but
it was not from St. Andrew’s that he gained his
peculiar gift of epigram that would search to the
heart of a thing in a phrase. That gift came from
the clear mind of the man himself. He continued
a great reader till the cab came to take him to
the hospital for the operation that preceded his
death. And the kindest of the obituarv notices upon
him appeared in The Bulletin, which had differed
from him so often politically and otherwise.

CAST back the doors! I stifle! Let
the air . . ,
Of the outer night rush m and seize
my hair
As with swift hands! My narrow body bare
Stretches and sighs and tautens like a thong.
Oh, every hour of daylight does me wrong!
Why are the nights so brief, the days so long?
The days of mask-like faces, formalness;
Of downcast eyelid, pearl-entwisted tress
lam the Emperor’s wife ! The ceilings press
Downward trap-fashion ; rafters sheathed in
gold
Are as cross-beams of pits that take and
hold—•
Tall pits of marble, glassy-smooth and cold.
I am the Emperor’s wife. I wore the hide
Of a she-leopard once; I rode the tide
Of splendid savage seas, my glistening side
Compressed by triton arms. I leapt and
screamed
Where down the hill the naked maenads
streamed.
Beneath the droop of boughs the faun’s eyes
gleamed
Goat-golden. Oh, he found me where I lay i
I was a striving, yes, a laughing prey,
Crushed, conquered, wed —I knew not night
or day.
Earth’s unmixed passion gorges all my
veins—
The scourging suns, the blinding summer
rains,
The breast-white mountains and the panting
plains.
What do I know of templed gods and laws,
Honor and duty? All my essence draws
From older fountains. Clash the foaming
jaws
Of rearing centaurs in their mating-fights!
The smell of blood and sweat and love
delights
My widened nostrils. Oh, those forest nights !
The crying dark, the heavy blood-like dew;
The feet of Life and Death that both pursue;
The lusty, rank, insatiate satyr-crew!
lam the Emperor’s wife. No ! I am I!
The hot Earth bore me. Though I live or
die,
I’ll seek my old companions where they lie.
Stain both my lids with blue, my soles
with red!
Sweeten with myrrh the black hair o’er me
shed!
I will rise up and leave this empty bed.
A straight, thin, purple robe is all I’ll wear.
I’ll take no veil; unto my knees my hair
Falls. Am I pale and burning? Am I fair
As some svelt forest-thing with bloody lips?
Now, ndw to steal where the dark city dips
In reeking alleys, where the river slips;
My jungles quit with lawless, fearless life —
The teeth of love, the death-fang of a knife,
And satyr-brawls, the maenad-women’s strife !
I’ll enter by some strait, scarce-lighted door,
Cross with bare feet the dank and wine-wet
floor—
Ah, now I am the Emperor’s wife no more!
Swordsman, Greek boxer, Goth —they wait
for me.
Now does my body live—now I am free!
My shredded robe slips downward to my knee.
Oh, I am naked as Life’s naked flame!
None ever spoke of law or coward-shame
In that Spring-fevered world from which I
came....
I fear no death! Let swift sleep end the
game!

DULCIE DEAMER.
The Scarlet Knot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Manuel levington found the
canvas labelled “Dione” in the
attic of an old house enclosed in
large, decaying grounds at Wilmington. This
once select suburb was in the hands of the
subdivision fiend. The red badge of auction
flaunted over the gatepost of many an ancient
grandee, and the bellman’s clangor filled the
erstwhile sedate atmosphere with democratic
discord.
It was Levington’s habit to follow the red
flag around, much after the manner of a
small boy tailing up the Salvation Army.
Here the analogy ends, for Levington ex-
pected to come by neither levity nor grace.
The lodestar which drew him upon these
suburban peregrinations was a passion for
antiques. There were nooks and corners in
some of these old mansions which yielded
ancient wonders.
The “Dione” was jambed away under a foot
of dust behind an assortment of dunnage
which was obviously the accumulation of
decades. It was a life-sized portrait of a
young woman, standing erect, with her beau-
tiful hands held loosely before her. She was
clad in a simple white dress of curiously
modern design, in view of the date of the
canvas, which was 1854. The sole touch of
color was a knot of scarlet ribbon on the
rounded bosom.
The portrait was signed, but the artist’s
name was unfamiliar, and aroused in Leving-
ton merely a sense of irritation. He knew
inspired .work when he saw it, and here was
the canvas of a master. He carried it —
awkwardly enough, for the frame was heavy
and cumbersome—to the light of the gable
window. What he saw now delighted and
thrilled him. The portrait was so lifelike
that for a moment he had an uneasy sensa-
tion of an actual presence. The white, blue-
veined hands which had ravished his first
attention had the appearance of being on the
verge of movement —of lifting, outstretch-
ing in appeal. The slender wrists seemed
to be flexing towards sudden animation.
And the eyes ! Levington marvelled at the
eyes, even while he scoffed. Once, by a trick of
lighting or perspective, he could have sworn
he discerned in their indeterminable depths
a wistful consciousness. They looked un-
waveringly back at him from the pale, ex-
quisite face, with its wide, smooth forehead
and framing of old-gold hair. Their color
intrigued him. One moment he thought them
forget-me-not blue; the next, he was equally
certain they were violet, turquoise.
“Good Lord!” Levington ejaculated in
growing bewilderment. “Dione!” The soft,
liquid syllables captivated his ear, so that
he repeated it twice over: * “Dione....
Dione.”
Generally speaking Levington shunned
paintings, particularly portraits. They moved
too slowly, and occupied too much space in
the little shop which he rented from Margot
Mortayne and her aunt. There was some-
thing about the Hr! in white, however, which
appealed to the Latin in him. The Italian
blood of his mother had 'bequeathed ito
Levington all the superstitious emotionalism
of the race. He chose to believe that the por-
trait owed its extraordinary fascination to
some supernatural quality given it by the
spirit of the original. So potent was the
illusion that whenever he looked he could
see the white, supple fingers trembling to-
wards rhythmical appeal. This exquisite being
actually had the appearance of soliciting his
interest, his protection.
But then Levington was peculiar. Bohemia
—such of it as has survived the anarchy of
respectability considered him eccentric,
while the world beyond frankly spoke of him
as mad. His attitude towards women, for
example, was unnaturally indifferent. With
the nervous equipment and inherited pro-
clivities of a satyr, his sex life was immacu-
late. He was supposed by his few intimates
to be searching for some impossible ideal,
some fourth-dimensional Chloe, and mean-
while the one woman whose existence he
recognised was Margot Mortayne. Not that
she was young, sex-ripe and passionately in
love with him, but because their business re-
lations brought them frequently together.
Levington’s abstraction blinded him to many
things about the girl which were patent to
the quarter. Margot alternated between
Heaven and Hell, while Levington squabbled
with his clients, or went into ecstasies over
a bit of Chinese porcelain.
Once he had decided to acquire “Dione,”
Levington made instant overtures to a har-
assed auctioneer. The canvas was not cata-
logued, and the owners had already sailed for
Europe. At his discretion, therefore, the
auctioneer asked £5, which was £4 in advance
of Levington’s ideas, and hurt his commercial
pride almost to the point of withdrawal.
But his sense of injury vanished when
later he surveyed his purchase in his bed-
room, over the curio shop. He had placed
the canvas squarely across a corner, so that
the light from one dingy window fell
obliquely upon it from the shadows. The
background of the painting was an even
black, and the effect was to give an odd
detachment to the figure. It seemed to
project itself from the frame. Levington
was frankly startled. He knew a sudden
impulse to voice aloud his admiration, as if
in direct response to the entity he crazily
thought to find at the back of the smooth,
ultra-violet eyes. The name escaped him
involuntarily: “Dione!”
He turned sharply at a sound. Margot
Mortayne was staring at him from the door-
way. Her cheeks were flushed, and her
eyes were virginal, embarrassed.
“Yes?” said Levington. “Yes?”
He was too irritated by the intrusion to
observe her quick hurt at his brusquerie.
“A man is asking for you,” said Margot
slowly. “I knocked, but you wouldn’t an-
swer. So I came in.” Her gaze went
past him to the canvas. “I think he wants
to buy.”
“I can’t come at present,” said Levington
in a nervous tenor.
Already she was half forgotten. He
stood, with his underlip sucked between his
teeth, regarding the face of Dione, which
seemed suddenly to have withdrawn into
smoky shadow. The white dress and hands
were become drab and indeterminate. Only
the scarlet knot claimed attention. Momen-
tarily focussed by a ray of sunshine, it
stained the inviting curve of the breasts
with an angry, blood-red blotch. An in-
stant, and it was gone.
Levington was vaguely aware of Margot’s
voice. “How beastly!” she was saying, in
a strained tone. Then, without pausing to
clarify the expression, she said again: “I
think it’s a customer.”
“I’ve already told you I can’t come,” said
Levington, with childish emphasis 1 . “Tell
him to call again to-morrow —any time.”
His look added plainly: “Well, why don’t
you go? What are you waiting for?”
She saw it, and the firm flesh of her lifted
throat shook with a tiny spasm. But she
did not move. Instead, she pointed abruptly
at the painting. “Where did you get that?”
she asked. “Who is she?”
“I bought it,” said Levington, his sallow
face mvsteriously aflame. “It’s 60 years
old. Well?”
“Oh!” said Margot.
It was all she could find to say. And pre-
sently she withdrew quietly, leaving Leving-
ton biting his nails in the middle of the

‘Some six months ago my little son,”
says Mrs. E. Curphey, of Black Street,
Culcairn, N.S.W., broke out in very nasty
sores over his face, hands and legs. These
sores were of such a virulent nature he could
scarcely bear me to wash him. After other
ointments and various blood mixtures had
failed, I tried Zam-Buk, and I can say with
pleasure that this grand balm healed the
trouble within three weeks. I now recom-
mend Zam-Buk with the utmost confidence
as a rapid and efficient healer.”

floor. There was a detachment about him
which brought her an odd sensation of fear.
She felt she had been talking to a stranger.
When she had dismissed the waiting cus-
tomer, she reclimbed the narrow stairs to
her own rooms. Her aunt looked up at her
as she entered.
"Who is with Manuel?” she asked.
“No one,” said Margot, astonished. She
recollected herself, adding quickly: “At
least, there w r as no one when I left him
five minutes ago. Why?”
“I thought 1 heard his voice,” said the
older woman, with just a hint of doubt. She
disapproved of the girl’s infatuation for the
curio dealer, yet did not dare to speak.
“Talking to himself, very likely. I sup-
pose even you will admit to his being queer.”
“I don’t know,” said Margot, with a sud-
den contraction of her brows.
She went to her bedroom, and surveyed
herself deliberately in the mirror. And the
thought in her mind suddenly crystallised
into uneasy belief. The portrait she had
just seen bore a peculiar resemblance to her-
self. She wondered if Levington had noticed
it. The height was the same, the features
and the coloring were sufficiently alike to
call for astonishment. She held her hands
loosely before her, after the manner of the
girl in white, and as suddenly snatched
them apart, as at the shaping of some evil
thing. The swift flooding of frightened
blood_ to her cheeks dispelled the almost, per-
fect illusion, and she turned away with a
little gasp.
Yet, when Levington passed her on the
stairs a minute later, his eyes went through
and beyond her without even recognition. A
dull anger at her heart, she heard him slam
the street door, and presently came the echo
of his feet along the asphalt. It died away
in the sudden painful tumult of her breath-
ing. All her warm woman’s flesh was in re-
volt. When she turned back to her work
she was trembling.
For days thereafter she did no more than
catch a glimpse of him. He seemed to have
lost all sense of proportion. He spent long
hours behind the locked door of his room,
whence issued vaguely, like the shadow of
sound, an interminable murmuring. His
face shrank to a sallow network of fretted
emotions. The trailing leash of his sanity
became hourly more frail and unsubstantial.
l( It w & s the night of his purchase of
ilione that an amazing purpose filled his
mind with disorder. A three-quarter moon,
climbing the stained sky beyond the adjoin-
ing roof-tops, set a molten beam on the
canvas facing his bed, imparting to the
white bosom a pulsing radiance which was
the very mockery of slow respiration. With
ensanguined eyes Levington watched, and
the miracle completed the circuit of impious
thought that had been with him all day. He
conceived the purpose of deliberately evoking
the imprisoned soul of Dione from its fast-
ness of color and perspective. His years of
sex-abnegation took him sourly by the throat,
lie was swamped in a cataclysm of awaken-
lng desire. To call into warm flesh and
blood those rounded limbs, those half-globed
breasts, the scented allurement of neck and
shoulders! What black art should provide
the open sesame to the lust of liis quickening
lunacy?
It was a month later that Margot Mor-
tayne, obtaining no response to her persis-
tent knocking, opened the door of Leving-
ton’s room, late one afternoon. He was on
his knees before the picture. His voice
reached her affronted ears, but the words
were indistinguishable, fogged by the vehe-
mence of his incantatory devotion—a mean-
ingless mouthing, whose accents chilled her
with horror.
Her face gone china-white, she reclosed
the. door which for once he had forgotten
to fasten, and withdrew dizzily to the thick
shadows on the landing of the staircase.
While she waited in a paralysis of inertia,
Levington appeared hurriedly, locking the
door carefully behind him. His eyes were
congested, and his hair was disordered. His
sallow cheeks were mottled with a week’s
beard. His limbs pliook painfully. He
seemed in the throes of a supreme nervous
exaltation.
Without consciousness of her palpitating
presence he began to lurch down the stairs,
mumbling as he went. A sentence —flung
sharply out on the crest of excitation-
pricked Margot’s understanding : “To-night!
Ah, Dionc, Dione, to-night!”
Presently her numbed senses told her that
he had left the house. Mechanically she
moved to the door of his room. Her purpose
was now quite clear. To destroy the canvas
was the natural and inevitable sequence of
the horror of past weeks. She felt for it
all the hatred she could have felt towards
a rival of flesh and blood.
Among her house keys was a duplicate
key of Levington’s room. She found it at
once in a of her sewing-machine,
from which she took also her scissors. They
came to her touch with the exquisite bal-
ance of a tried and .invincible weapon.
The portrait stood as she had first seen it.
In the fading light the white face and hands
of Dione seemed subtly accentuated. The
veiled eyes met hers with an uncanny sug-
gestion of defiance. The curved lips seemed
to mock. For a single instant Margot felt
herself yielding to the unholy spell of the
thing. Then, deliberately, she thrust the
point of the scissors into the painted flesh,
slashing and tearing in a frenzy. Only
when The canvas twined in strips at her
feet did she desist, suddenly aghast in reali-
sation of what she had done.
In terror she listened for Levington’s re-
turning feet, but the place was sunk in
silence. The only sound was the sob of her
overwrought breathing, and the yammer of
the blood at her ears. Nevertheless she
knew his re-appearance could not now be
long delayed. And when he came he would
kill her. _ He would know instinctively that
the sacrilege was hers, and he would kill
her—as shehad killed his dream. Unless
The idea came like a blow. If Levington
was indeed to compass her destruction, might
he not for one fractional yet eternal moment
oi time yield her his love? What matter if
later he trampled her beneath his feet in the
fury of blasphemy revealed! Let him do
with her as he liked, so that the deception
hold for but the brief space required to find
his arms, his lips!
Margot started at the faint noise of her
aunt stirring in her room across the landing.
With feverish energy she closed and locked
Levington’s door from the inside, withdraw-
ing the key. The scattered' remnants of
Dione she gathered and thrust in hiding,
trimming the remaining canvas evenly from
the frame. The heavy shadow of the on-
coming dusk would form a perfect back-
ground.
Standing before the mirror by the window
she arranged her white dress, and coiled her
heavy bronze hair after the manner of the
portrait. She had scarcely finished when the
street door below slammed. The loose boards
of the stairs echoed to the tread of impatient
feet. Levington was returning.
Singularly calm now, Margot stepped into
the heavy gilt frame. Only at the scraping
of Levington’s key did she realise that she
had forgotten the scarlet knot at the bosom
of her dress, and her heart raced with
sudden sick apprehension. Yet in that twi-
light its absence might escape notice.
So she stayed, her hands before her, as
Levington advanced to within a yard of her,
and fell on his knees on the threadbare
carpet. His silhouetted figure came between
her and the waning light of the window, and
she gazed at it in a sort of emotional ames-
thesia.
His words came in a torrent. They ex-
hausted her. Yet suddenly, abruptly, he
ceased. She sensed, rather than understood,
that he was about to touch the apex of his
madness, and her body flamed. Their looks
bridged the silence and the darkness. The
supreme manifestation was approaching.
“Come!” said Levington, his voice scarcely
above a whisper. “Ah, my beloved, see! I
wait, I burn!”
He stared with dilating eyes at the vague
shape of white hands floating, as it were,
upon the penumbra of darkened setting, saw
them twitch and slowly extend, saw —dear
God! what'miracle of Hell had his invoca-
tions achieved ! —the figure of Dione lift itself
from the frame and move towards him. The
velvet dusk fell behind her like a parted
curtain.
Levington gave one cry—“ Dione !” —and
toppled sideways, his face twisted. She
had her arms about him in a second, her
terrified voice cutting through the echoes of
the fall.
“Manuel! Manuel! O God, what have
I done! What have I done!”
She lifted him to his knees, crushing his
head to her breast, yearning over the limp
body like a young mother bereft, suffocating
with her fear. She came presently to her-
self on a sudden flooding of light. She saw
the florid, amazed face of her aunt, thrust-
ing at her from the doorway; saw clearly
the grotesque thing at her feet, that had once
been Manuel Levington, and the screaming
died on her lips.
She stood erect. As she did so she caught
the reflection of herself in the mirror. At
the curve of her white bosom was a bright
scarlet knot of blood, where the mouth of
the dying man had rested an instant against
her broken heart.

Love’s Laws.
[FOR THE BLLETIN.]
IN the High House of Emotion,
When I am by law elected,
Named and known by land and ocean,
I shall do what is expected.
I shall legislate for lovers
In a bill of many clauses,
Such as wit alone discovers
When, light-winged, at times it pauses
Over many pretty fancies,
Dear and dainty, pale and pearly,
As the bee above the pansies
Hovers in the dewtime early.
It shall be by me enacted
That dear Love with soul impassioned
(Now of bitter-sweet compacted)
Shall alone of sweets be fashioned.
At my bidding woe shall vanish,
Vows that break and ties that sever;
Tears and treason I shall banish
From the Court of Love forever.
I shall make it worse than treason
To decline a gift of kisses;
Life shall be an endless season
Fruited with such rosy blisses.
He who would with fraud or cunning
Poison Love’s ecstatic chalice
(Honest truth and noonday shunning)
Shall have whips to cure his malice.
Loved and lover shall be ordered
Never more to dwell in alleys
Where love sickens, bound and bordered,
But in cool, sequestered valleys.
It shall be decreed that honey
Spread on bread, snow-white and wlieaten,
Through the long day, gold and sunny,
In that valley shall be eaten.
Wine that never lurked in cellars,
From the amber grape outrunning,
They shall have, those valley-dwellers,
When they thirst with over-sunning.
Birds of song and birds of laughter
Shall be with them, laughing, singing,
Through the long day, and thereafter,
Mouth to mouth in passion clinging.
They shall hear the songs of waters,
Sylvan, silver, all-entrancing,
While around the Moon’s twin daughters—
Light and Shade—are softly dancing.
Since a lack of precious metals
Leaves the heart but ill-contented,
Money shall consist of petals
Reft from roses, sweet and scented.
All that hopeless love discovers
When it sits in tears dejected,
That I’ll cure, ye hapless lovers,
When by you I am elected!
