“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tlie Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude froni its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now ,all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land', wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushraan of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maonland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The'Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading ,matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

;
With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bool making is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewktt, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the publit to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“ (Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 213 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it,
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. —BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —It is the purest of Bitters, and
exertn a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of.'
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne-
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANEP WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-in vented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

OF THE
SYS TEM
NOW IS THE ACCEPTED TIME.
(FOR THE PUBLIC.)
I have decided —
Set my mind to a purpose.
My heart trembles,
I strain and steady it,
I am not afraid.
My whole life I devote to the chosen project;
If I fail I shall die despised as a worthless man,
As one who wasted his wealth of energy and time.
Though my youth, maturity, nerve, and love shall
have been spent for Man,
Men will refer to me before children as an instance
of folly, even of vice.
’Twill be a bitter return for a life passed in hard
struggling
Against inward weakness and outward opposition.
My Love even now rejects me,
She will not credit me with a noble intention ;
She doubts, yet loves me, making consolation —
I will pass on to work,
Never forgetting my love, but never returning to
her.
My heart shrinks from the prospect of loneliness
and poverty in old age,
From the grief of being misunderstood, despised,
or pitied by those I would did love me,
My flesh shrinks from the prospect as a child from
fire,
But I am not afraid, and push forward.
I will do the life.
If sincere in wish and effort success will be
obtained ;
If insincere, no success can come.
Life is a discipline.
My life to train and test me, not you,
To improve me, not you.
What for ? I cannot tell—
Your life does the same for you.
I have determined and feel happy immediately,
Relieved from doubt and wavering between
wishes ;
With one wish choice is settled quickly
Without possibility of repentance.
Comrade ! come, fix your purpose,
If you would be a rogue, be a rogue,
Or a good man, be a good man,
And bold to the end.

Pentridge-prison officials have lately been
going round the Vic. Government departments
taking from civil-servants orders for convict-made
goods. They now send a man with a bootmaker’s
measure sizing government feet for prison-made
boots.
Buffalo-hunters Cahill, Johnson and Flynn
tell wonderful stories of the deposits of the eggs
of wild in certain portions of the Northern
Territory. The swamps in the neighbourhood of
the alligators abound in the eggs of wild geese.
So numerous are they that they serve as the staple
food of both whites and blacks in the neighbour-
hood, and are actually cooked and fed to the
horses—the latter devouring their novel food with
relish.
Wills made in the couleur-de-rose boom-
days read strangely now. The big man of Dayles-
ford district counted his money in ’92, and dis-
tributed it generously all round, remembering his
poor sisters and his cousins and his aunts, and his
servants and the church. A farm and live-stock
were left to his only child. The whole foots up to
over ,£30,000. Then the daughter, who has been
given but little cash so far, is to step in for what-
ever’s left. But the estate is now only valued
at £22,871.
Her Grgcious has cordially invited the
young Khedive of Egypt to hang up his fez in the
hall at Windsor Castle when he visits Hingland.
V.R. grows diplomatic in her old age. Years
ago the other Khedive —the one who supported a
private ballet at the British bondholders’ expense
—came to London on the off-chance of being taken
in at Buckingham Palace, or some other royal
lodging-house. Nobody in particular met him at
the railway-station, so His Nibs drove off with his
luggage to Claridge’s hotel. At this crisis the
earless Earl of Dudley came to the rescue of the
Empire’s glory and took the potentate in.
At the North London Police-court recently
a damaged husband asked for a judicial separation
from his wife, on the ground that she habitually
jabbed him in the countenance with broken lamp
glasses and other sharp things. The poor wretch
was dotted with “ nasty cuts,” and “ much sym-
pathy ” was expressed for him by the Bench. The
Law, however, didn’t admit of granting a sum-
mary separation to a husband under these circum-
stances, the privilege being reserved for ladies only.
So the Bench committed the wife to prison for a
week, and she went off to do her sentence with
the openly avowed intention of jabbing her hus-
band some more.when she returned to his happy
home. |
“Jack” Stretch, the new Dean of Bal-
larat, deserves his promotion. One Sunday even-
ing a large Newfoundland dog found his way into
church while his reverence was preaching. Im-
mediately the attention of the assemblage was
riveted on that dog. The verger was called upon
to turn him out, with no effect. The dog made no
account of that verger beyond threatening to make
a mouthful of him. The muscular “Jack” turned
up his sleeves and descended .to the fray. Bruno
yielded and left. Then the victorious parson read
the congregation a lecture re people who couldn’t
keep their dogs at home. P.S. —That dog belonged
to J. Stretch.

SATURDAY, JUNE 2, 1894.
The Collapse of “New Australia.”
For the first time since the beginning of
the ill-starred experiment the gruesome
tale of “New Australia” is now officially
laid before the public. Hitherto the infor-
mation received has come in the form of
scrappy and inconclusive letters from evicted
and prima-facie prejudiced settlers, and until
the other side of the story was heard there
was always a considerable amount of uncer-
tainty as to the real condition of affairs.
But now that Mrs. Lane, wife of the chair-
man, chief organiser and dictator of the
colony, has told the other side of the story,
there is no consolation in it. It differs from
the narratives that went before it only in the
one circumstance that it lays the entire
responsibility of the failure upon the settlers,
whereas the settlers laid the entire responsi-
bility upon Mr. Lane. As regards the
failure itself, the latest picture only differs
from the others inasmuch as it paints the
collapse in a rather more hopeless aspect
than anything which ivent before it. New
Australia is now plainly a commonplace,
squalid, ignominious disaster. It has not
succumbed to outside circumstances. So far as
can be ascertained, the emigrants found a
reasonably good climate, a splendid soil,
well-disposed and hospitable neighbours, and
a Government which was prepared to assist
them to the utmost of its ability. The great
scheme went to pieces chiefly upon the
dismally vulgar question —-who was to wash
up ? So far as the information goes, nobody
was willing to wash up, and out of that fact
the trouble arose.
w * *
The principles of “ true mateship” seem
to have gone to pieces even before the first
contingent started. The pioneers quarrelled
among themselves in the Balmain barracks,
and they quarrelled more and more on the
voyage. Their leader was deposed and set
up again ; his official proclamations were
torn down and jumped upon ; and his ukases
which seem to have been numerous and
foolish were treated with derision. A
horrible habit of holding meetings and
appointing boards and committees and sub-
committees spread among the argonauts,
and every one who wasn’t on a board or a
committee rose in revolt against every one
who was. Meanwhile, the figureheads of
the show continued to issue vast masses of
futile rules and regulations, and the ex-
pedition was governed altogether too much.
By the time it arrived in Paraguay,
it seems to have been practically re-
duced to chaos. The rear - guard is
accused of having plundered the baggage
of those who were on ahead, and of
having sold their boots and shirts for drink.
A spirit of general objection entered into
these wanderers, and when the advance-
party pitched the tents on a ridge the next
arrivals promptly rooted them up and
planted them in a swamp. The committee
decided to put up some temporary shelters
and then proceed with clearing and planting,
and the balance of the party, feeling it
necessary to sit on the committee, thereupon
decided to let the clearing and planting slide
till permanent dwellings were erected.
Rations were exchanged for native spirits,
and there were high old orgies in New
Australia. Most of the mothers withdrew
their children from school to mark their dis-
satisfaction when the jam and pickles gave
out ; and even before this happened a good
part of the educational staff had abandoned
its business and gone off on missions to the
local heathen. One brawny male invalid is
accused of having wilfully wrecked the
doctor’s thermometer, and a lady in an
interesting condition insisted upon being
confined in a saw-pit instead of in the house
provided for her. Also the man with the
magic lantern went round giving exhibitions
to the Indians, but flatly refused to let his
mates see the show on any account whatever.
Altogether there were great doings in Lane’s
unbuilt city of Anarchy, and the only differ-
ence between official and unofficial accounts
is that they apportion the blame in diverse
quarters —the rest of the story is much the
same.
The riots and frenzy which are raging in
New Australia are, however, matters which
mainly concern the settlers themselves.
The people of old Australia are interested in
a totally different aspect of the question.
According to the semi-official statement now
furnished, Lane early realised that the
painted glories of his ideal community were
not going to be realised—which is a delicate
way or stating that he discovered the original
settlers had "been deluded by gross and
wicked misrepresentations, and by pretences
so glaringly false as to be utterly inexcus-
able. Therefore, instructions were sent to
the agents in Australia to represent things
strictly as they were—to leave the garish
ideal and set down to hard, dismal reality,
so that no further immigrants would set out
without a definite knowledge of what lay
before them. If these instructions were
really given they were not followed to any
great extent. The men who remained
behind had not Lane’s eloquence, nor his
gift of painting gaudy impossibilities and
making them look like realities, but in their
own humble way at least some of them
seem to have kept on booming the exploded
bubble all they knew. The people of Aus-
tralia only guessed that it was exploded from
the letters of the evicted settlers, and the
efforts of the local officials seemed to be
mainly directed to explaining away these
ghastly revelations, and keeping up the old,
poetic story about the orange-groves, and
the guitars, and the moonshine upon the
river, and all the rest of the alleged gorgeous-
ness. If these local officials really under-
stood New Australia as it was —if they knew
the truth, or anything dimly approaching the
truth, about that place of chronic desolation
—then a cruel hoax was perpetrated by
somebody on the more recent emigrants.
Lane’s agents in Australia may not have
actually circulated any false or deceptive
statements, but, so far as is known, they did
not publicly withdraw a single one of their
leader’s gaudy assertions of a year or so ago,
which assertions were mainly responsible for
the wreck that has ensued.
Only a few days ago advices from Maori-
land announced that the local organiser was
so much impressed with the gorgeous
“ Temple of Truth at Christchurch that he
had obtained plans of the structure with a
view to erecting a similar building in New
Australia. This circumstance was, in itself,
a good advertisement for the settlement, but
if the place is as Mrs. Lane describes it,
there is no demand for temples there, and
never will be, and the proceeding was
mere garish romance, and nothing more.
Mrs. Lane herself is understood to have
returned to Australia to recruit a large
number of girls for the colony, which she
now describes as practically a wreck, and but
for the fact that Lane’s secession almost
compelled her to put forth a statement in
his defence, there is no visible reason to
believe that the old delusion would not have
been officially kept up to the bitter end. In
fact, so far as concerns Lane and his own
little party of secessionists, the same old
story is being told and the same old delusion
is starting afresh. Whoever else may go
wrong, this little knot of believers preserve
the “ true spirit of mateship,” and are solid
on the underlying influences of piety, and
have no yearning after strange drinks and
Guarani maidens, and will never quarrel or
burst up or secede any more. It is the same
tale which was told when the original expe-
dition started, and which was told a second
time when the first batch of malcontents was
expelled, and which will keep on being told
after each disruption until there is nothing
of New Australia left.
• • •
As matters now stand, one-third, or there-
abouts, of the expedition has been evicted,
and is wandering about penniless in a strange
and hungry land. Another third has gone
out into the wilderness to start afresh ; and
the balance remains on the original settle-
ment, where it is left without spiritual
guidance, or any high ideal, or any true
spirit of mateship, so that it will most likely
fall away in search of strange liquors and
strange women like its outcast brethren.
Strange liquors and Indian girls have, seem-
ingly, done more than anything else to
aggravate the “natural cussedness” of the ex-
pedition. In this respect it has proved itself
just like every other expedition, and the
result is only what might reasonably have
been expected. Man will drink, and gamble,
and prowl round to the back-doors of
the dusky daughters of the land till
the end of time, and every scheme
that fails to take these facts into con-
sideration is certain to come to grief. The
constitution of New Australia was based
on the assumption that it is possible to create
a community where every person is sober,
moral, religious, and full of a holy yearning
for self-sacrifice, and the collapse came about
because there is no such community outside
heaven, and never will be. If Lane was
aware of this at the beginning, he perpe-
trated on his followers about the meanest
“ have ” of the century ; if he was not aware
of it his ignorance of human nature was so
vast as to be past reasoning about.
Another Rumpus in the Fold.
Some ministers of religion read and think, the
consequence being that they get into serious
trouble with a number of their brethren who
do neither. The Moderator of the Presbyterian
General Assembly in New South Wales, Rev.
Mr. Maclnnes, sought to shake off some of his
theological swaddling-clothes, a few weeks
back, and created quite a panic in the minds of
those of his hearers who like to be swaddled.
The curtain was hastily rung down on the
scene, and the orchestra played an orthodox
tune as vigorously as possible to divert public
attention, but the incident had the effect of
augmenting the suspicions entertained by
cynical outsiders that a good many parsons are
beset with the same doubts which haunt those
who have never professed any standard of
faith, A similar comedy has just been per-
formed in Queensland. In a luckless moment,
the local Presbyterians elected as their
Moderator the Rev. G. D. Buchanan, a man
of brains and pluck, whose later years have
been passed in an arduous endeavour to find a
modus vivendi under the crushing weight of
the Westminster Confession. Mr. Buchanan
is a Scotch - American who was known,
years ago, as a powerful preacher in
a Baltimore church. Blessed or cursed
—as the reader may take it —with a rest-
less spirit, which would not permit of his
spending his energies peacefully as a fashion-
able pulpiteer, he forsook Baltimore at a call
from Victoria. After he had been heard a few
times and proved his mettle, the Cairns Memo-
rial Church, East Melbourne, was built as much
in his honour as in that of old Dr. Cairns,
whose name it bears, and, while he remained in
charge, the congregation which assembled
Sunday after Sunday was larger than collected
in most Melbourne churches. Great was the
consternation when he announced, one day,
that he was bent on forsaking this snug pen in
the ecclesiastical fold and wandering away to
pastures new in the vicinity of Brisbane. When
the clergy and elders of the Queensland Presby-
terian Assembly made this erratic genius
Moderator, they might have expected him to
prove less “ moderate ” than was consonant
with a due regard for conventional placidity.
But his inaugural address outpaced their wildest
imaginings, and set some of them wondering
whether, after all, Calvin had not lived in vain,
and the entire scheme of election, fore-ordina-
tion and damnation become a played-out farce.
« # •
Whether it was artfulness on Mr. Buchanan’s
part, or bland simplicity, he fired his bomb-
shell, labelled “The New Theology,” in as im-
perturbable a fashion as though he were merely
striking a safety - match. Alluding to the
Maclnnes turmoil, above mentioned, he re-
marked that “ the storm in a teacup, which had
occurred in New South Wales recently, was
rather amusing. The Moderator said nothing
which Robertson Smith did not say twenty or
thirty years ago, but it deemed that the New
South Wales people only just now discovered it.”
In all likelihood Mr. Buchanan suspected
that the Queensland people were equally be-
nighted, and, foreseeing an outbreak, adopted
this ingenious method of letting them know be-
forehand what he thought of them. Anyhow,
he gave them a shock. His “ new theology ”
surrenders the infallibility of the Bible, the
basis of dogma, and the authority of creeds. It
dismisses hell as cavalierly as Sir Richard
Bethel was said to have done in his famous
judgment, and puts evolution, or perpetual de-
velopment, in the place of Genesis. “Men had
discovered,” Mr. Buchanan affirmed, “ that
theology, as a science, must progress as other
sciences had done.” To do this it had to be
grounded in evolution, and the “ new theolo-
gians ” were “ above all things evolutionists.’
“They believed in spiritual certitude, but
not in an infallible Church or Bible.” The
Bible was studied in accordance with the
“historical method” which set you learn-
ing how the men who wrote it were
circumstanced and what they meant by it. This
was what Robertson Smith was ostracised for
doing in the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica,” but,
said Mr. Buchanan, “When I was in Edin-
burgh recently Professor Rainy remarked to
me, ‘ Robertson Smith to-day would not need
to leave his chair in that University.’” The
Edinburgh University has got abreast of
Robertson Smith, but there are good folks in
Bananaland who have not, and when they
heard the Moderator of the Presbyterian As-
sembly denouncing dogma, portraying the
darkened condition of the Fathers of the Church,
and pointing the finger of scorn at a material
hell, they plaintively asked themselves where
they stood, and marvelled if the Rock of Ages
had been partitioned off for suburban allot-
ments.
# • #
The daily press, which is always eager to
attack anyone who appears to be letting go the
“conventionalities,” solemnly affirmed in a
ponderous leader: “It is not within our know-
ledge that the official representatives of any of
the great Protestant churches in Australia have
listened to an exposition of religious beliefs so
startlingly different from The authoritative ami
orthodox statements of Christian doctrine.”
Mr. Buchanan was warned that he had
“slipped many or most of the old theological
anchors of the Presbyterian Church, or, for
the matter of that, of all the leading Protestant
churches.” Others took up the cry yet more
vehemently, and, worst of all, the Secularist
lecturer, Wallace Nelson, reviewed the deliver-
ance from his platform and contended that “in
all essential particulars the Moderator’s address
was a statement of the philosophical deism of
Thomas Paine.” That was too much. The
Assembly deemed it necessary to take some
action, and, accordingly, a reverend brother was
put up, at a later sitting, to ask the Moderator
whether he had anything further to say, so that
“no one could consider him an upholder of the
deism of Tom Paine.” Thus impelled, the
Moderator pointed out a number of striking
differences between his views and those of the
bugbear of the churches, and set down, in
categorical shape, the articles of his belief.
Touching Gehenna, he remarked: “It seemed
as though it had been a revelation to some
people in this community that there was no
such thing as a material hell of fire. He did
not think there was an intelligent minister
among them who had ever believed there was
such a thing.” There were members of the
Assembly who doubted if some of the views set
forth by the Moderator were “ in accordance
with the Scriptures or the standards of the
church,” and who yearned to discuss them.
Bub, as in the Sydney gathering on a similar
occasion, the wiser heads were shaken deprecat-
ingly, and there was a general chorus of “ Drop
it, oh ! please, drop it.” So they dropped it.
* # *
Not, however, before the Moderator—a little
alarmed, perhaps, at the storm in his own tea-
cup—had averred and re-asserted that there
was not one of the confessions of the Church
which, if put to him in a proper way, he was
not prepared to swallow. How he would
reconcile the doctrines of election, predestina
tion and eternal damnation with the law oi
evolution, inspired by Infinite Love, he was,
fortunately for himself, not called upon to
explain. It is not a pleasant spectacle to see a
capable modern mind vainly wriggling under
the pressure of ancient dogmas and forced to
own his belief in them in the same breath with
which he curses them. But this is the penalty
which subscription to creeds involves. It is
only when students of these oracular questions
discuss them in the pages of some philosophical
magazine that the world gains the benefit of
free utterance without a glance over the
shoulder as to the fate of a pittance or the loss
of a livelihood.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Pauper and the Bank-Book.
A little while ago there was received at Niw
South Wales S.tate schools a circular lett« r
from the Education Department,, ordering tm t
there should be forwarded to head quarters a
name-list of all scholars who had banking-
accounts at the schools’ Penny Savings-bank,
and who, at the same time, had their names on
the “Exemption from School-fees List,” am
attended school without paying. Whether or
not the authorities seriously thought of recon-
structing the scholars’ deposits in payment o
their parents’ debts, and only relented on nnd-
ing that the penny-at-a-time deposits wouldn
pay reconstruction expenses, will probabj
never, for a certainty, be known. If they har
any such intention (as would really appear 1,1
have been the case) the New South Wales L( u
cation authorities stand self-convicted as tie
meanest men on record. However, the require'
returns were duly supplied, and nothing
further has since been heard of them. But > e
fact that they were, asked for has set some
school-teachers thinking. The practical resu
of their thought is—either the little p a »P er 01 ,
the bank-book has to go. With this beau i >'■
consummation in view, they frequently hm
scholars from using the school-bank >
threatening to reconstruct their few coppers i
payment of any school-fees that may be owing-
The result is that the lesson on Thrift, 1
encourage which the school-banks were ong»
ally floated, is entirely lost; the wou
depositor loses the chance of an extra vo e
the future by “blowing” the coppeis
hungers or hokey-pokey : the bank-book g
and the pauper remains. The Stale, sc io<
teachers fear that should school-fees codec ! e j r
continue to decrease as of lat 6 * 1 . g
salaries will be further retrenched,
a body, they are the most democra m
all State officials, as the only c . ® j.
civil servants who obtain and hold their P
tions solely on their merits and by exaniina
should be. But self-interest is stronger
any sense of right. Hence the attitude s
teachers have assumed with regard to
question of the right of a pupil to bank
coppers, when said pupil attends school 01 ,
exemption ticket. Which attitude is un e
for the following reasons: —(1) The ctlic ‘ r pj, e
of their offspring is the parents’ obligation.
State recognises this by summoning then
the child’s non-attendance at school mt
regulation number of days. (2) The sma ■
which the scholar banks in the schoo
belongs solely to the depositor. It re P re> i.
so much less cigarettes or sweets consU j; n
and has no more right to be re-construc


vinent of the parents’ debts than it has for
vone elee’s debts. (3) Even .the parent can’t
o all y school-fees, seeing that the authorities
?' ve granted immunity'from such by placing
ITo name on the exemption-list; and, finally
m the teachers should mind their own busi-
' ” They are not dependent on the school-
ffor their salaries. The total annual collec-
r n of school-fees throughout the whole province
laves, after deducting collecting expenses, an
mount which cuts a very insignificant , figure in
T province’s ten millions sterling revenue.
When free education comes! —and come it will
,il should— the paltry sum lost can be made
good by a legitimate mode of taxation.

Courage yet, ray brother or my sister !
ee p on— Liberty is to be subserved whatever
occurs ; „ , •
That is nothing that is quelled by one or two
failures, or any number of failures,
Q r py the indifference or ingratitude of the
people, of by any unfaithfulness,
Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers,
cannon, penal statutes.
What we believe in waits latent forever through
all the continents,
Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calm-
ness and light, is positive, and composed,
knows no discouragement,
Waiting patiently, waiting its time.
The battle rages with many a loud alarm and
frequent advance and retreat,
The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,
The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron
necklace, and lead-balls do their work,
The named and unnamed heroes pass to other
spheres,
The great speakers and writers are exiled, they
fie sick in distant lands,
The cause is asleep, the strongest throats [are
choked with their own blood,
The young men droop their eyelashes toward
the ground when they meet;
But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the
place, nor the infidel entered into full pos-
session.
When Liberty goes out of a place it is not the
first to go, nor the second or third to go ;
It waits for all the rest to go—it is the last.
When there are no more memories of heroes
and martyrs,
And when all life and all the souls of men and
women are discharged from any part of the
earth,
Then only shall Liberty or the idea of Liberty be
discharged from that part of the earth.
And the infidel come into full possession.
Then courage, European revolter, revoltress !
For till all ceases neither must you cease.
I do not know what you are for (I do not know
what I am for myself, nor what anything
is for),
But I will search carefully for it even in being
foiled,
In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprison-
ment—for they, too, are great.
Did we think victory great ?
So it is—but now it seems to me, when it can-
not be helped, that defeat is great,
And that death and dismay are great.
—Walt Whitman.
The Absentee’s Corpse.
The British Government, it is said, has resolved
to levy probate duty upon the colonial pro-
perty of all dead loyal subjects who, in their
lifetime, chose to get domiciled in the dear old
mother country. Samuel Wilson may die in
Australia, and be buried here to boot, but. since
he elected to domicile in' Beaconsfield’s
house and other British places, he will have to
enrich the British Government with a tithe of all
he possessed. Xu short, the Chancellor of
Britain’s Exchequer proposes to abolish the
absurd fiction that Samuel and his class are
Australian by deciding that they die wholly
and solely Hinglish. The Bulletin admires
the simple honesty of this legislation, and
trusts that ere Samuel pays his next visit
to his Victorian sheep - runs there will
he a British bill providing for Samuel’s
taxation as an absentee during the time he stays
away. Meanwhile, Australia, having now got
its lesson from “ ’Ome,” may possibly see fit to
take it to heart. In effect Harcourt puts his
hand to his mouth and whispers across the
briny deep—“ You see what we intend to do
with these people when they die. Make the
best of them Before the melancholy event
happens.” The duty of Australia is to grip
Time by the forelock and tax Samuel and Co.
before they pass hence. Great Britain is not
usurping any of our rights in this matter.
Australia has still the power to call the
absentee by the name of the land he
fattens upon, and charge him an annual
fee for living abroad. Britain will charge
him for domicile after his decease ; all
’things considered, Britain shows her modera-
tion in hot wanting to impose an extra
special rate. . The Bulletin has much printed
authority for stating that Queen Victoria loves
us dearly, therefore she must necessarily, be
very cross indeed with people of the Wilson
persuasion who give us constant cause for coni-
plaint. That by the way. The man who is
ueither British nor Australian has been set
’apart by the “’Ome”. Government as a fair
mark for taxation at both ends, and any . Bill
which will encourage him to have only one end,
that end being here, is a Bill that cannbt he
passed an hour too soon.
Timeo Danaos.
Premier Forrest, of Westralia, has “ declared
the Government- policy,” which is to bribe the
electorates with a new loan of £1,500,000, to
make railways from Southern Cross to Cool-
ganlie, from Mullevva to Cue, from Dounybrook
to the Budge town tinlields, and to the Collie
coalfields. The golden shower is also to extend
the Fremantle harbour-works, and to give all
the goldfields water-supply and telegraph-lines;
to establish a land-bank, a mint, cold-storage
works and markets at Perth, and to construct
“roads and bridges and other important
works.” It is also proposed to give every man
over 21 £3 a week for life, with free drinks,
two suits of clothes a year, a house to live
in, a black boy to wait on him, and
the run of his toothpick at a Government
restaurant. “The speech, was received with
the utmost enthusiasm.” No doubt; and the
enthusiasm will continue as long as the borrowed
money lasts, when the enthusiasts will pack up
their traps and quit, leaving the residents,
tethered to the soil, to pay the interest. Premier
Forrest’s proposal would be received with very
modified enthusiasm in the eastern province,
where people are beginning to realise the mean-
ing of taxation for absentees; but the
westerners are young and verdant, and will
probably be dissatisfied unless they, too, pay
through the nose for experience. The crafty
Mr. Forrest “doesn’t believe in land-
taxation”—not he. In fact, he “sees no
necessity for additional taxation ” of any
kind. Taxation means restitution of the
plunder with which the first families have
gorged themselves; to borrow means more
plunder—and those who are nearest the source
will carry most away. The Bulletin advises
the workers of Westralia to get rid of the
Forrest yoke at all costs, and return a radical
Parliament at the June elections. Then, if
they want to borrow, their own representatives
can borrow just as well as the Forrests, and
there will be greater certainty that the money
is devoted to avowed and legitimate objects.
Any man that now grabs for the golden bait is
just as big a donkey as the donkey who races
for carrots on a stick; and, like the donkey,
all he will get of the carrots is the sight and
smell.
The Queensland Labour-party.
Editor Bulletin, —The Labour - party in
Queensland, like its big brother of New South
Wales, is fast qualifying for the knacker’s yard.
It cannot stand corn, and its recent election
triumphs have turned its head. Nothing can
be more absurd than to represent Townsville
and Ipswich as exclusive victories for the A.L.F.
The success of Ogden and Wilkinson was
largely due to the dislike the small-fry business
man has to MTlwraithism, and to the very
natural repugnance of the R.C. to vote for a
man whose only saint is .King William, and
who thinks the Boyne the greatest battle of
all time. There are a thousand good proofs
that, except in the mining districts, the
Labour-party cannot stand alone. Yet at the
present moment it makes no distinction be-
tween its sympathisers and its enemies, and,
indeed, makes no secret of the fact that it
regards with more favour MTlwraith’s pro-
nounced antagonism than Lilley’s qualified
support. The recent deliverances of the
Browns and the Reids have practically des-
troyed that alliance between the Labour-party
and the “ Whigs,” which produced so much
good last session, and blew the gaff on so many
Ministerial jobs. In the coming session the
Labour-party, constituting 25 per cent, of the
House, is likely to be the only Opposition, for
its last year’s allies, finding themselves regarded
at best as merely unprofitable servants,
will take their despised support elsewhere,
and drift infallibly into MTlwraithism, or
indifferentism. In these circumstances, the
session promises to be the paradise of the
jobber and the syndicate!’, and though the
Labour-party may yell, their protests will be
closured in the House and stifled in the news-
papers. Had the alliance continued there was
a decent prospect that “One-man-one-vote”
would become law this year —and even the
most pig-headed unionist must see that this
reform is a necessary prelude to “Socialism in
our time ” —but under the altered conditions,
for which the Labour-party is alone responsible,
that reform is impossible. In its place we
are likely to have an Elective Upper House on
a property basis, which will make “ Labour in
politics” a'negligible quantity for years to
come.— Demos.
Dear Bulletin, —Will you allow a chappy t°
express his annual surprise and disgust at th«
free-born Australian custom of “ keeping-up 1
the Queen’s Birthday, an event which excites
no display of “ loyal feeling ” in that lady’s own
particular country. Your boasted Democracy
becomes a huge joke on May 24, and again on
November 9, when, for some dark, pitiable
reason, you publicly exult over the fact of
Albert Edward’s nativity. You scoff at the
Fat Man who deprecates anything that is “ un-
English.” May I swear, with all my heart and
soul, at the un-Englishness of Australia’s de-
votion to the royal persons of “ Wales” and
his mother ? In London, the alleged head-
quarters of British grovel, May 24 is neither a
holiday nor an event of the least public interest,
whilstNovernber 9 is merely remarkable as the
occasion for a Lord Mayor’s Show. Probably
not one in every three of the city’s residents, or
visitors up from the country, know that the
Coming K. was born on that date. In pro-
vincial towns it is the local mayor’s day, else-
where it passes quite unnoticed. Albert
Edward’s tailor and perfumer and bootmaker,
&c., burn a gopd deal of gas at night in compli-
ment to their royal customer, but there the
public rejoicing terminates, even in London.
The Queen’s Birthday, I believe, is also
honoured by a dozen shopkeepers, but not
with much enthusiasm; seeing that she buys’
verv few goods off them, These things
being thus, where is the ghost of an
excuse for Australia’s flunkey outbreaks.,?
Why does. an. entire, continent deliberately
create a tradition of loyalty out of its own
blasted inner consciousness ?, You may answer
that a number of early Hiuglish settlers, full of
stupid Hiuglish reverence for crumbling insti-
tutions, persuaded themselves that these pre-
cious birthdays were .great Hiuglish festivals,
and that young Australia is now glad to take
the holidays as they come without considering
Queen or A.E. in the matter. The explanation
is not satisfactory. Some of the birthday
entertainments are greasy with “ loyalty,” as
at the Melb. Exhibition, for instance, where
Miss Somebody recited a certain ill-constructed
letter written by the Queen some 40 years ago.
Young Australia seems to have a stomach for
such muck as this. Again the natives begin to
muster in force at birthday levees, to mark
their aggressive love for the monarch that is
and the monarch who is expected to come next.
These ghastly devices for forming class distinc-
tions would fizzle out but for the assistance
of the public holiday. Men are requested to
cease work and play at loyalty, and the game
of shaking hands with the Governor is set apart
for the “ well-dressed ” class of the community.
Have you ever considered the educational in-
fluence of Birthday levees, dear Bulletin ?
They breathe a spirit of aristocracy into the
nostrils of the retired publican, who is proud
to think that no seedily-dressed person would
be allowed the same privilege as himself. By
virtue of his dress-suit the ex-poison-vendor is
able to go through a form of making obeisance
to the Queen (the Governor acts for Queen),
whereas an equally “loyal”subject, attempting
to enter the vice-regal presence in a brown
tweed suit, would be shoved off the premises
by a policeman. Your Australian Birthday
grovels are, to my mind, a much more per-
nicious influence than the Court functions of
poor old Hingland, where “ loyalty ” is not
for ever being rubbed into the public by Her
Majesty’s Government. There, now ! —Yours,
English.
Melbourne Presbyterians, who refused to helP
along Miss Sutherland’s charity work, on th e
ground that she never insisted that the infant®
beuefited should have a working knowledge o*
the Shorter Catechism and a saving faith in
John Knox, are beginning to realise the fury
of a woman scorned. Miss S. has made some
remarkably plain statements about fathers of
the kirk, and offers to point out the houses of
ill-fame of which they are landlords. Surely it
is easy to rebut this scandalous charge by
pointing out that, on the recent testimony of a
London city missionary, the slums from which
Wales draws his rents are the vilest and
filthiest in the latter-day Babylon. Or, if a
still more distinguished precedent be needed, it
may be pointed out that the Calvinistic deity
itself draws a substantial revenue of glory
from the existence of a hell full of the most
abandoned characters.
Professor Threlfall writes to S.M. Herald
bemoaning the retrenchment of Government
endowment to Sydney University, and swells
the number of students as far as possible while
reducing the apparent cost of their training.
The number of graduates, and not the number
of students, is the real test of University work,
since some who are entered on the books do not
attend the classes, and nearly all who do attend
stay for three years or more, being thus counted
thrice over in the figures which the alarmed
Professor marshals. Much more to the point
is Mr. Philip Moses, who states that to
produce the 120 graduates of last year it took
12 professors at £9OO a year each, I at £BOO, 1
at £750,2 at £5OO, 3at £400,5 at £350, lat £3OO,
12 at £250, and no less than sixty others at
smaller salaries. That makes 97 professors in
all, or very nearly one professor to every
graduate ! ! And these professors, in addition
to their salaries, divide £2455 per annum in
“ fees.” Mungo Macallum, the recent author
of a book as dead as its subject, draws £619 ;
somebody else gets £439, and so on. Theodore
Gurnev, professor of mathematics, appears
to get £l5O in salary, but his fees are £625
additional; another mathematical professor,
Mr. Newham, gets £4OO in salary, and £316
additional in fees. It would be interesting to
know exactly what labour is performed in
return for these stipends. All this proves to
the hilt The Bulletin’s contention that the
State which endows must also control.
Pending the unrestricted opening of the Uni-
versity, except by qualification, the wouldj-be
reformers of that gaudy institution should
agitate for an extension of the evening-lectures
principle. At present, so far as Sydney “shop”
is concerned, it only embraces the B.A. course,
while in Melbourne no evening lectures are
given at all. A year or two back a determined
demand for evening courses resulted in Melb.
University authorities undertaking to provide
lectures if £lOOO a year was granted by the
State or guaranteed by the students. Munro
refused, on behalf of the State, and properly,
too, seeing that the country mainly supports
the institution, while the intending students
couldn’t see why they should pay more than
the day undergrads.
Prof. Morris is on his way towards being a
saviour of his adopted country. Nothing is so
likely to check the flow of that British capital
which has been unsinewing us, as an appeal to
the English public for money for the relief of
Australian distress. Since Francis Adams
died and the Investors’ Review has sheathed
its bowie, there is no one to tell them the truth
in England directly ; Prof. Morris has done so
indirectly. No one is so dense as the common-
sense English capitalist. Facts will cannon
against his brain for a quarter of a century
without effect, while the spent ball of such a
rumour pop-gun will knock him so completely
that he will sheer off Australia for a decade
after, and shoot his millions into a South
American Republic. Such will be the effect, it
is probable and devoutly to be hoped, of
Morris’s Times’ letter. And such an effect
will be the postponement of our bond-slavery,
and of the day, which all true jingoes pray for,
when the affairs of Victoria will be administered
under the control of a receiver of the English
Chancery Division.
Mayor Manning, of Sydney, the knight with
the beautiful London Journal legs, was re-
quested, the other day, to take the chair at a
Town Hall meeting called to consider the case
of Montgomery and Williams, the condemned
burglars; and refused, on the ground that he
was not prepared to commit himself to an
expression of opinion on the subject. This dis-
ingenuous reply does a lot more credit to Mr.
Manning’s legs than to his soul. No one asked
or desired that he should express any opinion
—in fact, no one seriously suspected him of
having one. He was simply requested to be a
nice-looking figurehead on the platform, to
announce that Mr. Smith would now propose
the first resolution, and, later on, that
Mr. Jones would propose the second
resolution; and do other routine business.
Therefore, even if his dislike to expressing an
opinion was so deep-rooted as to amount to a
disease, his excuse had no more to do with the
matter on hand than it had with the transit of
Venus. Curiously enough, however, when the
person concerned is some influential ex-politi-
cian (who used to be, and, perhaps, still is, a
power in the constituency Mr. Manning aspires
to represent), and who is serving a very short
and well-deserved sentence for a very glaring,
sneaky crime, Mr. Manning’s dislike to ex-
pressing an opinion doesn’t trouble him in the
least. Only a few days ago he appeared as an
eloquent partisan—not as a mere passive figure-
head —in a deputation which demanded the
release of Francis Abigail. On behalf of that
hypocritical swindler, who sharpened his cold-
chisel on the Tables of the Law and made a
jemmy of the Word of God —who pranced with
a Bible in his hand at the head of sectarian
processions, and who waved the red rag of
religious bigotry on all possible occasions, and
lived on his assumption of cast-iron integrity,
and was utterly merciless in Parliament and .in
the courts towards all others whose honesty was
even remotely suspected —Mayor Manning was
enthusiastic, and his regret at the “cruelty”
of Abigail’s very brief sentence was almost
pathetic. Tho difference between his views
on these two occasions creates a suspicion that
Mr. Manning’s beautiful legs have led him
astray. Montgomery and W illiams, at their
worst, were smaller and far less dangerous
criminals than Abigail. In their case, Mr.
Manning wasn’t required to commit himself—
it was even an open question whether the meet-
ing would commit itself, for it was simply
convened to consider the matter, and it was
quite as open to it to decide that the two
burglars should be hanged as to come to the
opposite conclusion. Mr. Manning, after three
or four years as Mayor, apparently chooses to
ignore the duties of his office rather than em-
barrass in any way the callous set of people to
whose coat-tails he is politically attached.
English rule in India, according to—
Sydney Telegraph.
But much has happened
since the mutiny which jus-
tifies us in regarding such
occurrences with com-
posure. . . The history
of our rule in India is a
record of continuous re-
form. Under the proclama-
tion which transferred its
government to the Crown
described as the “Magna
Charta of the Indian people”
—a policy of political jus-
tice was promulgated which
has in the main been loyally
carried out. . . Thus, on
every hand is visible abun-
dant evidence of the bene-
ficent work done in India by
the Britisli Government dur-
ing the last three decades,
and it is in contemplating
this great work, in which all
classes have had impartial
share, that we may well
question if the mysterious
markings on the mango
trees we read of to-day are
of the slightest significance.
Brisbane Courier.
India is, in fact, governed
by an alien and despotic
power. . . It may be said
that Britain has only re-
placed a bad despotism by
a better. But it is one
thing to submit to the
despotism of a native ruler,
and quite another to submit
to the despotism of an alien
power. And, bad though
the native ruler may be, in-
dolent, corrupt, careless of
human life, he yet thinks as
the people think, and swims
with the stream of their
customs and superstitions.
English rule seeks the wel-
fare of the Indian people as
we throw a bone to a dbg.
It is not too much to say
that nothing but force, ever
present and reputedly in-
vincible, can prevent mutiny
and rebellion among a
people ruled as we have
elected to rule India. , .
But peace and safety will
never be assured until the
rights of man are recognised
in the Government of India
as in all free countries.

After New South Wales Government and
Assembly have done much, and waived more,
to remedy the flaw in the Elections Act which,
purely by inadvertence, disfranchises electors
who remove from one constituency to another,
they find their action nullified by the wilful
malice of the Legislative Council, w'- ch threw
out the main clause of the Amending Bi by 18
votes to 9. Not a shred of justiff ion was
alleged for this extraordinary procedure,
which can only be prompted by a wish on the
part of the representatives of Property to debar
as many poor voters as possible from recording
their votes. If the Government insists, the
Council must give way. But the incident is
another proof of the urgent necessity for mak-
ing the Upper House representative of the jus-
tice and intelligence, not the prejudice and
stupidity, of the people.
Seven swagmen were arrested at Maryborough,
Vic., the other day for being out of work.
They were Melbourne men, they said, travelling
in search of billets. A local Solon fixed them
severely with his eye, and said they were a
formidable gang, “ and with a little burgling
knowledge would be dangerous to the com-
munity.” Six months. There was nothing
whatever to lead Dogberry to believe that the
men had any burgling knowledge, or were likely
to acquire any such knowledge, but he sent
them to gaol to protect their innocence. A
local movement is on foot to get this legal
genius ten years’ solitary confinement, because
it is widely believed that with a little homi-
cidal mania he would be dangerous to the com-
munity. He has no homicidal traits, but it ia
a fact all the same that if he had he would be
dangerous to the community, and we hope he
will get his ten years. For the same good
reason The Bulletin believes that everybody
else ought to get at least six months.
The little batch of Queen’s Birthday “honours”
which has reached Australia is another pitiful
evidence that times are bad in this country. So
many awful “revelations” have been made of
late that it is difficult now to create a knight
with any certainty that he won’t presently take
his title into the Insolvency-court, or the .dock,
or some place equally disreputable. Therefore,
a little has been done in the way of knighting a
few old or pottering mediocrities, who appear
too commonplace ever to do anything of
a surprising character, whether it be good
or bad, and having done this the Cro.wn
seems to have “ put the peg in and sworn off.”.

K.O.M.Q. John Lackey, of the New South
Wales Upper House, a peaceful nonentity of
64, has also been made a K.C.M.G. ; and the
two remaining “honours” go to J. B. Patterson
and Arthur Renwiok. Patterson’s title
has been practically a foregone conclusion
ever since he issued his famous invitation to
York and May, and the decorated butcher can
now meet Parliament and fall from his high
estate with a light heart. If he had met Parlia-
ment earlier he would probably have fallen
before the Birthday came round, and then his
bauble would never have arrived, therefore the
fact that he has kept the Legislature in a state
of adjournment for eight months, despite the
most vigorous protests from all parts of the
country, is a beautiful and providential coin-
cidence. As for poor little Renwiok, he seems
to have acquired his knighthood simply because
—well, because he insisted on getting it.
Mr. Thomas Smith, a shareholder in the Mer-
cantile Bank, desires silence for the future
concerning the balance-sheets of that precious
institution. “ His counsel is to let the dead
past bury its dead,” which has been the advice
of Fat Man from the outset. Gentlemen of the
T. Smith species seem incapable of understand-
ing that the Davies scandal is as much alive to-
day as it was two years ago, and will continue
to pop up in unexpected places for an indefinite
period. Neither do bank-shareholders duly
recognise their proper relations to the manage-
ment. They are the people who drew big
dividends from that same said-to-be-dead
past, and on the whole they didn’t do badly
out of the scandals. All they have now
to do is—meet their calls for the benefit
of depositors, the depositors whose money
was paid away in unearned dividends.
Bub, as showing the blind assertiveness of
shareholder Smith, he has the “cheek” to
propose a grant of £lOO to somebody out of the
Mercantile Bank assets. He ignores the patent
fact that his interest in the assets is nil, since they
will not be equal to the full payment of de-
positors. Smith is no uncommon case. In-
deed, the Law is a good deal like Smith when
it permits the shareholders in a hopelessly
insolvent concern to appoint the liquidators,
and otherwise behave as though they were all-
important personages in the winding-up pro-
cess, instead of mere background characters.
Directly a bank stops payment the shareholders
arfe sleeping partners in a bankruptcy, and
should be treated accordingly, whilst the
depositors appointed a receiver with strict in-
structions to get every available penny out of
the “ firm ” — i.e., the said shareholders. When
busted banks are dealt with in the same manner as
busted butchers or bakers, the shareholders will
begin to give a sharp eye to their own business,
and the day of Davies tentacles and Munro
clans will come to an end. Reconstruction
was primarily the work of “ enthusiastic
shareholders.”
By a late English mail come particulars of a
case strongly resembling that of Montgomery
and Williams, now under sentence of death in
Sydney. Two constables discovered three
young colliers robbing a chicken-house. A
scuffle ensued, and one constable was beaten
and kicked, and otherwise ill-treated. He was
able to go home, but some seven hours later he
was found dead in bed, and the medical
witnesses attributed his death to shock
caused by the violence to which he had
been subjected. The colliers were sentenced to
death, with a strong recommendation to mercy ;
but the sentence was almost immediately com-
muted by the Home Secretary to one of penal
servitude. Here we have a case in which the
constable actually died from his wounds ; none
of the constables assaulted by the Sydney
criminals has died or is likely to die. If Eng-
land reprieves when life is actually taken, shall
Australia hang when there is no guilt of blood-
shed ?
New South Wales Railway Commissioners grant
firms doing business to the extent of £/0,000
per annum in railway freights, three yearly
tickets with a discount of 75 per cent, on
season-ticket rates, and three free passes, also
an additional pass for each £20,000 freights in
excess of £70,000. It is easy to recognise the
principle on which a private firm acts when it
makes concessions to large purchasers or cus-
tomers doing heavy business ; but that prin-
ciple does not apply when the State acts
as a trader. To the State as a trader, the
man who does a thousand pounds’ worth of
business appeals for concessions, proportion-
ally at all events, with as much reason
as the man doing a business amounting to
a hundred times as much. As the Commis-
sioners’ regulation runs, seventy men may do
£70,000 in railway freights without any con-
cession whatever being granted them, but if one
man comes along and does all their business, that
customer will receive the concessions and privi-
leges enumerated. And - ’ yet it is admitted, as
a political axiom, that seventy men, each doing
a thousand pounds’ business, are more an object
for State encouragement than is the solitary
individual who does a seventy-thousand pounds’
business. Is the regulation, in addition to being
impolitic, an illustration of the common ten-
dency to grease the fat pig ?
Mr. Isaac Jacobs writes to Melbourne Age on
behalf of the Chosen People’s character, and
many of I.J.’s remarks are fair and to the
point. But when he asks whether “ the pawn-
broking class of Jewish money-lenders are any
worse than their Christian confreres ?” the good
man has evidently a bad case. He might as
well suggest that Chinamen are no more un-
desirable than the larrikins who herd with
them. It is even doubtful whether Mr. Jacobs
could put his finger upon one pawnshop keeper
in Melbourne who is nob a Jew by blood, and
though the business may be, as he says, fairly
conducted, from the pawnbroking point of view,
it is still a business that brings upon a Christian
the contempt of his own people. A John Jones
loses caste when he hangs three brazen balls
over his doorway, whereas an Isaac Jacobs
doesn’t yet—though the time is coming. Not all
the grand Jewish of the world can alter
that fact.

Statistics as a basis of argument figure again
on the water-drinkers’ platform. During last
year in New South Wales, 4650 persons were
convicted of drunkenness between the hours of
8 a.m. Saturday and 8 a.m. Sunday, while only
1529 were convicted for that offence between
8 a.m. Sunday and the same hour on Monday.
Therefore, argue the Templars, the Sunday
closing of hotels reduces the drunk-list from 4650
to 1529, giving us an accretion of 3121 sober
people to the community. But, first, many drink
in their own houses on Sunday, and remain in-
doors, who drink in pubs, on other days and are
caught on their way home. Second, those who
drink in pubs, on Sundays are taken better care
of by the publican, as his business safety may
be compromised by his customers getting into
the hands of the police. He accordingly either
keeps them in his house till they sober up, or
sends them home with an escort. Thirdly, of
drunkards who fall into the hands of the
police, the great majority spend all they have
on Saturday, and are thus compulsorily sober
on Sunday; and, fourthly, when the police
have locked up 4650 people for Saturday’s orgy
they haven’t left at large in New South Wales
more than two or three thousand of that class
of drinkers to operate upon on Sunday.
THAT “BACKBOUE."
Mr. Marshall Lyle, writing to S.M. Herald
re the condemned burglars Montgomery and
Williams :
The results of the abolition of| capital punishment in
other countries are worth considering. They show that
the supporters of capital punishment have not one word
they can say in excuse for themselves, unless it be that
the English race is more ferocious and brutal than the
other races of Europe. 1 will mention a few instances of
the effect following abolition in other countries.
Holland.—Capital punishment abolished Sept. 1870
(there was no execution since 1860). The statistics of
murder were as follows; —1861-9,16 murders ; 1871-9,17
murders; and this notwithstanding an average increase
In population.
Finland.—There has been no execution since 1827. The
Judge of the Court of Appeal states: “The security of
Eerson and property has not been in the least diminished
y the suspension of capital punishment. Murders are
extremely rare."
Switzerland.—ln 1874 capital punishment was abolished
by the Federal Council. In 1879 Cantons were allowed to
choose for themselves, and two or three elected to re-
instate the death penalty, but the majority decided
against its introduction.
Belgium.—No execution since 1863. In the 10 years
before 1863, 921 murders. In the 10 years after 1863, 703
murders.
Prussia.—ln decade 1869-78 484 persons sentenced to
death ; only one execution.
Portugal.—Capital punishment abolished.
Roumania.—Capital punishment abolished.
Tusoany.—No execution for mofe than 50 years.
Russia.—Capital punishment only retained for treason
and military insubordination. _
America.—Michigan, capital punishment abolished in
1847 ; Rhode Island, 1852 ; Wisconsin, 1853 ; lowa, 1872;
Maine abolished it in 1876, but restored it in 1883,
but after studying the effect of bringing the death
penalty back, in the interests of morality and to
stop crime, abolished it again in 1887. In Michigan the
statistics show that since 1847 murders have de-
creased relatively to the population 57 per cent. As to
Wisconsin, Governor Washburnb writes in 1873“ It is
20 years since the abolition of capital punishment. No
State can show greater freedom from homicidal crime.
With a population representing almost every nationality,
statistics show that crime, instead of increasing with the
growth of the State, has actually diminished.” Of lowa,
Senator Jessup writes in 1876:—“Murder in the first
degree has not increased, but has for four years decreased.
Previous to the repeal of the old law, there was one mur-
der for every 800,000 people. For the four years since
abolition there has been one in every 1,200,000, There is
more Lynch law where the gallows is retained.”
Editor Bulletin, “L.M.’s” letter about
Mildura does not go to the bottom
of the difficulty. The Mildura settler cries
about broken promises and plants dying
for want of water, and he will have to
cry. No irrigation scheme that involves
pumping, on anything like a large scale, can
possibly pay. Every acre of land needs at least
53,000 cubic feet of water a year, and if it has
to be lifted only 40 feet you have an expendi-
ture of 60,000 foot tons of power per
acre annually. Calculate what that comes
to for hundreds of thousands of acres,
and you have a lively notion of the cost for
coal, &c., to say nothing of first cost, interest,
and maintenance of works. A squatter can
use his washpool engine and pump to irrigate a
few acres of cultivation. He has the pumping
tackle, anyhow ; firewood costs nothing but
carting, and that can be done any time. He
must find work for his engine-driver between
shearings. It is the case of the Egyptian fellah
who waters his little garden with a Persian
wheel when he has nothing else to do. The
irrigation problem in Australia is yet unsolved,
and will remain so till an engineer with an
original mind takes it in hand without regard
to precedent.—Y.R.

A respectable little company, consisting
largely of Frank Oates, took possession of Sydney
Royal last week, and ran a brief season, the'
principal item on the programme being that fear-
some literary effort, “As Large as Life.” There
are many features about this alleged comedy that
are too horrible to be seriously discussed, and
where it isn’t horrible it is generally incoherent,
and where it isn’t incoherent it is mildly and
gently idiotic, and the rest of the time it is
maudlin. Therefore, The Bulletin hereby drops
it softly into the tomb and trusts that it will
never again be heard of. Its one distinction is
that it is really the worst and most aggravating
comedy this paper remembers.

“The Shamrock and the Rose,” having:
flourished in Sydney, may repeat that miracle at
Melbourne Royal. Cheap prices cover much'
dramatic sin, especially where Ireland is con-
cerned, but if a reduced tariff can cloak the male-
factions of Charles Holloway & 00. in this
instance, poor old Melbourne must have pawned
its brain-pan. Some years ago a rampageous
stranger, named O’Grady, came from Britain to
produce his own Irish narratives upon these same
boards, and public opinion cast him forth. He
cursed the local critics, shook a Celtic fist at the
gallery, and went growling back to his lair. Yet
the works of O’Grady were intellectual bean-
feasts compared with “The Shamrock and the
Rose,” in which the one tolerable character— a
comic process-server with a grimy countenance —i B
borrowed from O’Grady aforesaid. The villain of
this piece seems intended to deter mankind from
crime. He is wicked under difficulties. As soon
as he comes to the front with a base design, he
receives a blow between the eyes, but in the
next act everybody ignores the ill-fated creature’s
discomfiture, and he goes on plotting as though
he were a complete success. Whatever happens
is a flat contradiction of some previous event. An
aged father secretes .£15,000 in a black bag, and
the villain topples him over a precipice, where-
upon the bag turns out to be empty, in order that
the villain may suffer further discomfiture. Also,
after the virtuous farmer has been charged for a
long time with the murder, it transpires that the
old gentleman was never killed at all, and the
corpse had no foundation in fact. Furthermore
the farmer’s virtuous girl swears that he was
in her bedroom when the murder wasn’t com-
mitted, and the farmer retaliates by mentioning
that he is married to the lady, but neither of
these idiotic affirmations makes the least difference.
Charles Holloway aggravates the impossibility 0 f
“The Shamrock and the Rose ” by playing the
chief Irishman. The festivity of Charles is even
sadder than his brogue, and his brogue i 8 a
grievous matter anyway. Miss Alice Deorwyn
caricatures simplicity in the part of a deserted
colleen, whilst Miss Williamson now appears as
the Saxon spinster, with pleasing results. The
comic process-server falls to the lot of Sweeney,
and the fine old fruity voice of Harry Daniels is
humorously cast for the character of a desperado
armed with a gun and a tin medal stamped with
the words, “No Mercy.” Many other people are
more or less satisfactory, including the villain,
whose strong point is a certain masterful mannei
of falling down when assaulted.
At Melb. Princess’s the army under Bland
Holt continues to carry Burmah by storm. On
second thoughts B.H. is not the actual leader of
this Christian mission, although his gallantry in
jumping his horse! over a chasm (by deputy) and
waving his wounded arm for reinforcements is the
main feature of a glorious campaign. Nature did
not design its Holt for a dandy captain who is a
demon when roused, but as a delineator of hia
own identity. That outspoken comedian never
fails to amuse. The all-round immensity of “ A
Life of Pleasure” was chronicled last week,
and meanwhile this huge production has waxed
bigger if possible. Apart from dying Dacoits
and Gatling guns it embraces riots in Ire-
land, a realistic house-boat party on the
Thames, dissipation at the Empire music-hall,
and a large amount of domestic tragedy.
Above all things it is superbly giddy. When
Miss Watson flings a glass of zoedone at
Sass’s shirt-front, and retracts her determination
to enter the demimonde, the moral atmosphere
grows sultry. Likewise there is a good deal of
summer weather about when Sass, having sneaked
into the apartments of his lawful bride, attempts
to carry out the marriage contract. Perhaps it
is as well that Sass doesn’t act these risky scenes.
He merely shoots his shirt-cuffs and looks like a
gentlemanly iceberg, leaving the ladies to play up
to themselves, as it were. This is bad for true
dramatic art, but good for propriety.
** * *
The antithesis of Sass is represented by
Diver, at the Bijou. The midnight episode in
“ Friends” runs parallel with the wife-chase in
“ A Life of Pleasure,’’ the only difference lying hi
the fact that Diver goes gurgling after somebody
•else’s wife, whereas Sass is concerned with his
■own hymeneal property. Diver reels with the
intoxication of the moment; Sass maintains a cold
■equilibrium and says “Haw!” Society must
judge between the genuineness of these rival per-
formances, and if the taller actor gets the vote
marriage may reckon itself a dead failure without
further ado. Two more nights of “ Friends,” an
admirable but unappreciated show, will bring
■comedy to a halt at this house.
On Saturday the Montague-Turner Opera
00. opens here under Garnerian management. They
start upon the oft-told tale of “ Maritana,” and
hope to excite the populace with rapid changes of
programme. Also, charges for admission have
been re-constructed to suit the times, and dress-
circle tickets to see Don Caesar brandish his top-
note at a soldier’s doom are now obtainable for
three shillings.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus is getting along cheer-
fully at the Alexandra, where matinees are
thrown in twice a week, and the funny clowns
ought to be thrown out for ever. Thus far the
animals have had no chance to bite their keeper
in public, but John Burns is beginning to shake
the dewdrops from an incipient mane, and his
genetal style holds out the promise of a gory
tussle anon. John Burns is a religious influence,
nevertheless, for the tamer has learned to sing
“ O ! To be a Daniel 1” with much feeling. Martyn
Hagan is a recent addition to the Alhambra Co.,
and the Coghills have a pretty firm hold of affairs
at the Gaiety.

From an Argus criticism of Madame Urso
in one of her purely show pieces :—“A combina-
tion of harmonies and double stopping, perhaps,
appeals more to the initiated than to the casual
listener, but we may ask our readers to believe
that it is a thing which few of the greatest living
violinists would attempt and in which none could
conceivably achieve a more complete success than
did our gifted visitor.” The humour of music
reporters is wholly unconscious. Take the Akgus
authority into ah assemblage of Welshmen who
enjoy the recitation of a poem in their native
tongue. Assure him that it is a fine poem, splen-
didly spoken, and then ask him seriously to feel as
though he had appreciated the performance.
The good man will laugh. Yet he asks people to
admire the work of a skilful mechanic, although
they can neither realise the difficulties of tb®
handicraft nor find beauty in its result. Music is
the one universal language of civilised humanity,
and the fiddle that merely talks Welsh to Welsf
men is not making music at all.

fhe°famous contraltos persistently fly in the face of the
1 Hpmic rules of voice-produotion; and are, therefore,
as examples for students. Madame Sterling and
“°.*T Gomez are phenomenal in their power, hut they
A w use two registers of their voices. Their method is to
?"the chest register up to Q or A; then produce a
register up to G or A ; the head voice being
dispensed with altogether. The majority of good con-
voices, such as Madame Yanderveer Green s or Ada
rwlaslev’s would not last long if they indulged in this
° »thod Madame Belle Cole’s method, on the other
n,nd is to make the registers overlap, and she has
developed the head voice, just as a soprano won ddo ; the
result being a long range of even quality,, a blending of
ful three registers. The absence of strain or forcing
institutes the chief charm of singing, and the reserve
0 f tone, which a good contralto voice can coram md
P ,?th this method, produces more striking and satisfactory
ffpnta after all than the mere loudness which is the chief
iTpopWistic of many contraltos. Of course this has a
Sng effect while the voice is fresh, but the upper
notes are the first to give way ; later on the chest register
fella and the ruin of the magnificent organ is deplorable.

TilvDampierspraioed her dear little ankle at Ballarat
on V Regina’s birthday. They were playing “ Robbery

it didn’t die of joy straightout.

Arthur Swanborough, an old theatrical manager, tells a
storv of his first reception of Albert Edward at the St.
Tames Theatre. In an economical spirit of grovel he
ordered the vicinity of the royal box to be illuminated
wRh Pink candles. The house was draughty, and the
candles were continually getting blown out by the wind,
whereupon they diffused a smell of smouldering wick
until a hot, excited usher could relight them. Presently
» Wales” turned up, and Swanborough flunkeyed him
along to his box, wondering whether his Royal Highness
would be pleased to address a kingly remark to his loyal
•übieot The Heir Apparent, being now fairly within
nose-shot of the triumphal candles, snorted; I say,
Swanborough, what a d d stink ” Then he frowned
slightly and blew his august nose with imperial disdain.
Adelaide Standard published its pitifully abusive notice
and M.’s “Paul Jones,” without having the wit or
decenov to conceal the reason for its gall. “ A man named
Tallis takes the money at the door,” is the sort of line in
which a vituperative critic gives himself away. Obvious y
the Standard had been offended by Tallis, a generally
pleasant enough manager “in front," who. moreover
does not take the money at the door.
A correspondent from the city of magnificent distances;
“During the last few months we have been visited by

confess, after some considerable experience of them, that
Adelaideans are pious frauds.”

calking, critical canaille,” Said he of them, “It is wrong
to be malicious ; but to be stupid, it is a crime. All the
same, the clever Mr. Hall is a most bathetic personage.

M. LuCre, the husband of Camilla Urso, had one thril-
ling experience in his life, anyhow. He was travelling by
express, with his wife and a concert-party, to give a per-
formance at Philadelphia, when he found to his horror
that the violins had been left behind at Washington. It
was necessary to go back for them, and Lu6re implored
the conductor to stop, so that he might catch a return
train and bring the lost luggage along in time for the
show. But the conductor didn’t see it; his train wasn’t
timed to stop, and nothing—not even a handful of dollars
—would make him depart from his schedule. The most
he would do, after much entreaty, was to slow down as
he passed a certain wayside station, and Lufere might
taKe his life in both hands and jump if he liked. The
Frenchman jumped accordingly, went head-first into a
sandheap, caught the return train, and the violins and
a badly-scratched and abraded husband were at Phil-
adelphia by seven o’clock that evening.
In Maoriland, lots of “ utility ” actors, who, five years

Monday, 28th May, was the anniversary of Tom Moore’s
natal day, and was also the wedding-day of actor Jack
Cosgrove to Miss Flo Dillon, also of the Princess Theatre
Dramatic Co. Brian England was best man, and Harris
Ireland the bridesmaid. The bride, whose nom du
theatre is Dillon, is the daughter of Dr. Belcher, the
divine who is at the head of Dunedin High School. She
is pretty, in the delicately wild style of Mrs. Potter, and
is not without a dot.
All the characters in the “Life of Pleasure,” at Melb.

The large Blanche Lewis, with hubby Albert Norman

A curious affair stopped theatrical performances at
Windsor Castle for nearly 30 years, the gap between C.
Kean and Irving. The entrepreneur had the ill-luck to
engage one Jimmy Rogers, comedian, who was disgusted
to receive 13s. 4d. as his Royal wages for the night—nowa-
days he would be a £2O a week man. The morning after
the show he turned up at one of the London police-courts
with “ A donation to the poor-box, your Worship, 13s 4d.,

Queen Victoria and Mr. James Rogers, comedian.” For
this his snobbish manager sacked him.

One of the New Australians, Mr. Edward

The country is like the Darling Downs in Queensland,

Adjos, about nine miles from here, there are between 300
and 400 women and only 14 men—including the priest.
Parson Fitchett told an Adelaide audience
recently that the gallows was an evidence of civic
life christianised. The Bulletin long ago pointed
out that Christianity reached its consummation
in “Nosey Bob,’’ and that the gurgled “0

typical utterance of latter-day religion.
W. C. Shipway, another member of the
Soudan goat-hunting contingent and an enthusi-
astic Single-taxer, proposes to stand for Padding-
ton (N.S W.). Being a Single-taxer, W. C. Ship-
way naturally wants absolute Freetrade; he wants,
further, to abolish payment of members and fix
up an elective Upper House on a property basis,
so that his Henry Georgeism is curiously, mixed
with the soundest Fat Man principles. Also, he
points to the fact that he has lived for 14 years in
the electorate as a proof that he has its interests
sincerely at heart. Which proof, by the way,
isn’t so convincing as it might be. Bertrand, for
example, has been a lot more than 14 years m
gaol, but that doesn’t show that he has the in-
terests of the gaol at heart.
The Australasian publishes, side by side,
two photographs of Port Melbourne railway-pier
—one, dated 1884, showing it lined with vessels
and thronged with busy people ; the other, dated
1894, showing it utterly silent and deserted save
for a! few loafers and unemployed. The difference
is supposed to represent the horrors of 10 years
Protection—what it really represents is the
horrors of 10 years hard borrowing. The curse of
some 70 or 80 millions of “foreign capital” has
laid Melbourne waste in the interval, and the
vessels which used to dump down vast loads of
unpaid-for material, for the building of boom rail-
ways, are gone, never to return. Also, since the
new wharves were built and the river dredged the
shipping goes up the Yarra now.
A curious deadlock has come about at
Doncaster (Vic.). The Shire Council consists of
six members, four being a quorum. Two of the
six are away at Coolgardie. A third one persists
in moving all manner of wild and horrible resolu-
tions, and when the others dissent he walks out,
and the meeting lapses for want of a quorum.
Minister Webb, being appealed to, explained that
the only legal remedy was to hold four successive
meetings, and, if the offender didn’t attend, to
declare his seat vacant, but the remaining coun-
cillors pointed out that they couldn’t form a meet-
ing without him, and he wouldn’t attend unless
he was allowed to propose all the motions, and
they were carried unanimously, and if he did
attend they couldn’t expel him for being absent.
So the deadlock continues.
There are many troubles in the lot of a
Minister of the Crown in these provinces. On®
is the female deputation which comes in and tell 8
you that you were drunk, and another is the male
person who comes in and shakes you, and knocks
your head against the wall. In Maoriland recently,
a youth, who had been consigned to the Industrial
School, was accidentally drowned. His father at
once called at the Education Department for the
purpose of shaking the Minister, but that gentle-
man being out he shook the Inspector-General
instead till his spectacles and his hat and most of
his clothes flew off. The shake, in fact, was the
most cordial thing of its kind ever seen in Welling-
ton. Then he engaged in single combat with the
messengers, clerks, police, door-keeper, office-boy
and charwoman, and when at last he was secured
it seemed as if a Zulu army had devastated the
office.
Dibbs feels sanguinary that he will succeed
for Tarnworth.

Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday, A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture, Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Regent and Wells
streets, Redfern, and Park and Pitt streets,

Among the active supporters of the Uni-
versity evening lectures movement down South
in 1892 were the then Premier Shiels, Barristers
Madden and Higgins, Chancellor Brownless,
Murray Smith and the Age and Argus. The
concession could have been granted by re-arrange-
ment of the time-table, but the Tories of the
University preferred to block it and did so effectu-
ally by demanding <£2 10s. per course extra from
would-be-students. Therefore, many under-grads,
continue to pay for lectures which they never get,
their only substantial return for heavy fees being
the pen, ink, paper and attention received at
examinations.
“The presence of the German cruiser Falke
at Yailele, instead of inspiring the Samoans with
fear, has had the contrary effect, as the natives
say they are prepared to try conclusions with her
in the event of a crisis.’’ Which means that there
is going to be another scrimmage in the Uonny-
brook of the Pacific, and there is a chance that the
natives, who are spoiling for a fight with the Ger-
mans, will get all they want and a bad licking into
the bargain—especially if the Germans are allowed
to play a lone hand by England and America.
Vailele, which is seven miles from Apia, is a place
dear to Samoans, for here it was, a few years ago,
that they beat off the German attack andpxultingly
challenged their foes to “ try it on again.” And
the German naval men want to try it on again
badly, but in such a manner that they will come
out on top. Vailele is a place that can be de-
fended even against Maxims, but a party could
easily take it from the rear by making a circuit
from Apia inland—provided that the Tua Massaga
“ push,” who hold the Apia district, would act in
conjunction with an invading force, and clear the
way. But even if Malietoa’s troops do ally with
a German landing-party, the temptation to
slaughter them once they get them in the_ bush
would be irresistible —and, from a native point of
view, patriotic and honourable.

Dear Bulletin, —In your sub-leader of
21sfc, on the burst-up of the New Australians in
Paraguay, you say
The next trouble will probably be a civil war between
the moral tone party and the crowd with no moral tone,
and Tire BuliLktin backs the immoral lot for all it is
worth. People of high moral tone are seldom any good in
a fight.
A shocking sentiment —and yet how true! Nine-
teen out of twenty soi-disant possessors of a “ high
moral tone” have a great aversion to fight, and
hence the ungodly and immoral man does mostly
come out on top. I don’t mean to say that there
have not been great and glorious exceptions. If
history is not lying, the Huguenots were pure-
living and moral toned, but yet full of fight ; so
were Cromwell’s brigade and the old Puritan
fathers. I daresay you have heard of the develop-
ment of the great German house of Godeffroy in
the Pacific. The success of their gigantic estab-
lishment, whose sphere extended from Valparaiso
to the Orient, was due to one man, Theodore
Weber. He always put four questions to those
who sought employment from him as traders,
agents, or clerks Can you learn native languages?
Can you live among the natives without forcing
quarrels ? Can you keep your mouth shut about
the firm’s business when you meet white men?
Are you a moral man ? If the applicant answered
the last query in the affirmative he was never sent
away to an outside post, but kept employed as a
clerk. “ A man who says he’s moral,” said
Weber, “is hardly ever any good for a post of
danger. He’ll rarely fight when wanted, and his
morality only brings him into contempt with the
natives, who think his morality is caused by a
diseased mind. There is only one place for a moral
man in the Pacific—that is behind a counter.”—

How Gilbert Died.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
There’s never a stone at the sleeper’s head,
There’s never a fence beside,
And the wandering stock on the grave may
tread
Unnoticed and undenied—
But the smallest child on the Watershed
Can tell you how Gilbert died,
For he rode at dusk with his comrade, Dunn,
To the hut at the Stockman’s Ford ;
In the waning light of the sinking sun
They peered with a fierce accord—
They were outlaws both, and on each man’s
head
Was a thousand pounds reward,
They had taken toll of the country round
And the troopers came behind
With a black that tracked like a human hound —
In the scrub and the ranges blind
He could run the trail where a white man’s eye
No sign of a track could find,
He had hunted them out of the One Tree Hill,
And over the Old Man Plain,
But they wheeled their tracks with a wild
beast’s skill,
And they made for the hills again ;
Then away to the hut at the Stockman’s Ford
They rode with a loosened rein.
And their grandsire gave them a welcome bold '
“ Come in and rest in peace—
No safer place does the country hold—
With the night pursuit must cease j
And we’ll drink success to the roving boys,
And to Hell with the black police.”
But they went to death when they entered
there,
In the hut at the Stockman’s Ford,
For their grandsire’s words were as false as fair,
They were doomed to the hangman’s cord—
He had sold them both to the black police
For the sake of the big reward.
In the depth of night there are forms that glide
As stealthy serpents creep,
And around the hut where the outlaws hide
They plant in the shadows deep,
And they wait till the first faint flush of morn
Shall waken their prey from sleep.
But Gilbert woke while the night was dark—
A restless sleeper aye,
He had heard the sound of a sheep-dog’s bark
And his horse’s answering neigh—
And he said to his mate: “ There are hawky
abroad
And it’s time that we went away.”
Their rifles stood at the stretcher-head,
Their bridles lay to hand,
They wakened the old man out of his bed
When they heard the sharp command—
“ln the name of the Queen, lay down your
arms,”
Now, Dunn and Gilbert, stand 1 w
Then Gilbert lifted the rifle true
That close at his side he kept,
He pointed it straight at the voice and drew,
But never a flash outleapt—
For the water ran from the rifle-breech,
It was drenched while the outlaws slept,
Then he threw it down with a bitter oath
And he turned to his comrade, Dunn :
are sold,” he said, “We are dead men
both,
Yet there may be a chance for one—
I’ll stand and I’ll fight with the pistol here,
You take to your heels and run.”
So, Dunn crept out on his hands and knees,
In the dim, half-dawning light,
He made his way to a patch of trees
And vanished ere fled the night—
And the trackers sought for his tracks all day,
But they never could trace his flight.
But, Gilbert stepped from the open door,
In a confident style and rash,
He heard at his side the rifles roar,
And he heard the bullets crash,
But he laughed as he lifted his pistol-hand,
And he fired at the rifle-flash.
Then out of the shadows the troopers aimed *
At his voice and the pistol-sound,
With the rifle-flashes the darkness flamed ;
He staggered and spun around.
And they riddled his body with rifle-balls
As it lay on the blood-stained ground.
/
There's never a stone at the sleeper’s head;
There’s never a fence beside ;
And the wandering stock on the grave may
tread
Unnoticed and undenied ;
But the smallest child on the Watershed
Can tell vou how Gilbert died.

“ Molesworth,” an aristocratic place 60 years
ago, got its name from the family of “Old Moley,”
the big-brained Equity Judge of Victoria for 30
years, “Faucett” Lane, a poverty-stricken back
highway near Glasnevin Cemetery, was called
after the family of Peter Faucett, ex-Justice of
N.S.W. Supreme Court, who has just died.
F. P. deLabilliere,
whose book on “Federal
Britain : or The Unity
and Federation of the
Empire ” has just been
published, was born in
a Melbourne hut 53
years ago.- He went to
London at 21, and has
written an “ Early His-
tory of the Colony of
Victoria.’V'- ~
Australia claims
Gordon as an Austra-
lian because he came
here as a young man
and grew up with the
country, and now the
daily press wants Mrs.
Humphrey Ward, as
an Australian author-
ess, although she left
this country when she
was five years old, 38
years since.
R. S, Smythe is
indignant now if you
call him “the Much-
Travelled,” “No,” he
says, “ my boy, Carlylo
—don’t foreret the B. A.
—is much - travelled.
I’m the Much More
travelled.” Carlyle,
8.A., had an article on
Boerland in a recent
Argus, which re-
counted how President
Kruger bought a dozen
handkerchiefs from a
Johannesburg store-
keeper when he went
to England to see
Queen Victoria, being
advised that everybody
used handkerchiefs at
Windsor. The day he
returned the store-
keeper received nine
handkerchiefs in a neat
, parcel, with a request
for credit. President
Kruger had only been
to Court three times.
But even this doesn’t
come up to the N.S.W.
commercial traveller
who borrows a hanky
when he leaves Syd-
ney ; then, at the first
stopping - place, bor-
rows another and re-
turns the first one
(soiled) to the lender
of the second; and so
on all through the trip,
winding up by return-
ing the last dirty rag
to the original lender
in Sydney,
JimmyChappes, the original of “ Cheesey,
in Marcus Clarke’s novel “For the term of his
Natural Life,” has just died at Hobart, aged 73.
By-the-way, many unpublished manuscripts of
Clarke’s are in the hands of Mr. Woolcott, of Mel-
bourne, who was his solicitor. Woolcott is a
grandson of the famous Peter Pindar (John Wol-
cott), who invented the legend about King George
111. and the apple-dumpling.
Parson Jefferis has come back to his old
North Adelaide church, which he left for Sydney
Pitt-streeb Congregational. His English boom
gradually petered out, and his peculiar oratory
was coldly listened to.
With the exception of Owen and Manning,
who are neighbours at Hunter’s Hill (where all
the Sydney Equity lawyers live), none of the
N.S.W. Supreme Court judges are ever seen
together off the Bench.
The following N.S.W, M.’sP. were origi-
nally printers by profession : O’Sullivan, M‘Court>
Stevenson, J. D. Fitzgerald, Haynes, Campbell-
Gillies, Morgan, Miller, Sam. Lees, Houghton
and Sharpe. Verily, ink’s thicker than water.
Alfred Allen, M.P., the great N.S.W.
teetotal statesman, has another book of poems
well forward. A friend, enjoying the privileges
of intimacy, says that it will include a rhymed
version of the Wood and Coal Bill of a couple of
years ago.
An up-country Victorian paper lately said
in a leading article : “ There need be no longer
any demand for Jules Verne’s and other black-
guards’works of imagination.” Next issue came
the correction : For “other blackguards” please
read “ Rider Haggard’s.”
Rowland Rees, formerly the leading
“eccentric” member of S.A. Assembly, told the
E. Torrens electors that he would lead the Oppo-
sition on his election ; in six months would be
Premier ; in twelve, Sir Rowland Rees, K.C.M.G.
Sir Rowland polled just 31 votes.
Newnes, the Tit-Bits pirate, is vaguely
alleged to have been made a baronet. He will
probably take for his arms the death’s head and
cross-bones rampant. The probable genesis of
this cheeky person’s ennobblement is his recent
greasy article on Queen Victoria’s dolls.
Now that there is a vacancy in the N.S.W.
pension-list, through the death of ex-Supreme
Court Judge Faucett, we may soon expect to hear
of the retirement of Mr. Justice Foster, and the
elevation to the Bench of Mr. Toby Barton, Q.O.
—who ought to have been there years ago.
Ex-Judge Peter Faucett, who died last
week, appeared in public for the last time six
weeks ago. He entered N.S.W. Legislative
Council one evening (after a long absence) when
the House met, shook hands all round, and left
by another door, after the President had taken the
chair.
One trait in the character of the late ex-
Judge Peter Faucett deserves to be widely known,
now that it cannot cause him any inconvenience.
Although, of course, frequently imposed on, he
was never known to refuse alms to a mendicant in
the street or elsewhere. There is at least one
N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge who, when asked
for alms, invariably looks out for a policeman.
THEY WANTED MAX TO BE RESPECTABLE.
Mr. KAUPMANN: “You haf a poy named Max in der Cirgus, and he vos
our youngest son vot run avay from home!”
CIRCUS MANAGER: “We have a boy of that name, a very troublesome
boy, too, but we hope to make a decent tumbler of him.”
Mr. KAUPMANN : “Vell, so long dat you make him decent, ve never mind
how much he tombles?”
Here is an item of secret history. Judge
Owen, of N.S.W. Equity Court, would now be
N.S.W. Chief Justice but for the fact that a
cablegram sent to Europe, where he was then
travelling, offering him the post, failed to reach
him. So Judge Darley got the Chief Justiceship.
Ltttg. Ali Mouy,JDfelbourne’3 Chinese soli-
citor*'wears his pigtail down his back under his
clothes. Ypu can see it disappearing down
between his shirt-collar and his skin. Ling is a
good cricketer" and| an excellent French scholar,
as Scotch College records prove, and he is a very
excellent fellow, to boot.
George Upward, the noted Victorian eight-
oar coach and ex-stroke, is a fine example of manly
self-reliance, pluck—and luck. Originally appren-
ticed to a saddler, he learned shorthand and got
into the Vie. Government Printing Office. Then
he became associate to Judge Williams; then
secretary to Premier Gillies ; and when the posi-
tion of Sergeant-at-Arms fell vacant, he got that.
His next stop will probably be the Bar. After
that, possibly a Judgeship will terminate a career
always onward and mostly upward.
THOSE SYRIANS!
FARMER WOODPECK: “Holy blazes, ’as yer place bin struck b’lightnin’?”
FARMER WAYBACK : “No; wife was afraid of Syrian hawkers, so I got her a gun. After I
had a bullet dug out of my leg, and buried half the stock, I thought it time to
lose that gun. It’s safer for my wife to shoot with an axe.”
N.S.W. Minister Slattery declines to
accept “until after the general election” a banquet
and testimonial tendered him. He is right
to be cautious. A Sydney man on trial for arson
once invited his friends to dine with him “ after
bis acquittal.” They duly turned up—and found
he had just got seven years.
In its obituary notice of Edmund Yates>
S.M. Herald says that “ after ten years of sue"
cess, Mr. Yates actually underwent a term of two
months’ imprisonment in defence of the rights of
free criticism.” That was hardly it. Mr. Yates
got into gaol for having made a thinly-veiled
accusation of adultery against a lady.
M‘Gregor, the Labour-member just re-
turned to S.A. Council, was employed on relief
works six months ago, and just before his election
he was navvying on deep drainage excavations at
Norwood, the chief town of his constituency. He
is a shrewd, well-read Scotchman, though now,
because of an accident, he is almost blind.
The late Edmund Yates was fond of tell-
ing a story about a joke made by John Leech, the
Punch caricaturist. Yates told him that Robert
Brough (author of “Songs of the Governing
Classes”) was going to Australia. “Ah,” said
Leech, “is he going bo Brough it in the bush?”
It was the only joke Yates ever heard Leech
make.
Une of the sisters of solicitor and barrister
Ah Mouy, of Melbourne, is in the variety-pro-
fession and known as Eunice Fernandez, pianists
and mandolinist. In the former instrumental
capacity she was for long attached to Harry
Rickards’ show. The casual observer would more
readily judge her to be of Andalusian origin than
of Celestial.
A sequence of four names picked at random
from the list of loyal citizens who attended
Lord Hopetoun’s levee—W. T. Lazenby, Victor
Lemme, D. B. Lazarus, T. A. Levey. Another
batch—Councillor levers, R. L. levers, William
levers, sen., Albert E. Israel, E. T. J. Ick, G. H.

a Jewish feast.
The affable Judge Kettle, of Maoriland,
doesn’t believe much in medical certificates. Once,
he says, a juror appeared before him and handed
up a document stating that he was confined to
bed with a serious illness, and couldn’t possibly
appear. “I think,” said Kettle, with his most
heavenly smile, “that you made a mistake in
delivering this to me personally.”
N.S.W. Justice Windeyer Jast week fell
into a smileful error while sitting in Vice-Ad-
miralty. He was deep in his notes, when a comely
lady was called. When she had got into the box,
the Judge looked up, and blandly said : “Thereis
no divorce on to-day, madam.” The lady, who
happened to be a spinster, indignantly informed
his Honor that she didn’t want divorce, and hoped
she never would. His Honor humbly apologised.
All people named E. T. Smith seem some-
how connected with alcohol. Knight E. T.
Smith, of Adelaide, lives on the product of alcohol,
being an ex-brewer; B. T. Smith, the Gough-
phonograph, lives on alcohol, because if it didn’t
exist he could not make a living by railing against
it; the late Drury-lane manager, E. T. Smith, is,
through his son, L. L. Smith, responsible for
Creme de Bouzy champagne, and a good deal of
Victorian wine and brandy business.
David Christie Murray, the novelist, who,
when in Sydney, dined with Carington every
evening and regularly walked arm-in-arm with
that potentate to Parkes’s Balmain residence, said
the other day in an English court that he thanks
Heaven he has had a child by a woman who is not
his wife. This was bald in itself, but as an illus-
tration of a phase in that foolish drama of
“ Hands Across the Sea,” or something of similar
name, it shows us Christie Murray and som«
Australian statesmen still in grip. “**
An old-time Victorian anecdote. “Goom*
labee” Ryan Was a squatter-farmer who lived in
Vic. N.E. district during the year that bushranS
Morgan “bossed ’’ that territory. The latter ffiS
incurred old Ryan s hatred through stealing fv.
him a favourite blood horse, and Ryan swore ■
dying vengeance on the outlaw. Through f
mostly, many of the small “ cookies” werefriendl'*'
to Morgan, and Ryan scattered broadcast y
challenge to the “stand and deliver” man i
steal another horse ! A small roof-sheltered ha' 0
stack commanded a view of the only approach i
Ryan’s stable, and upon- this heap for over a v '°
the old man, fully armed, lay watching f*
Morgan from dusk to dawn, never passing a
night in his bed. Morgan often left his mar
close to the homestead, but he did not dare to fac ( *
Goomalabee’a fire, and the bushranger’s sensational
death at the hands of Quinlan at Peechelba alone
brought Ryan’s weary vigils to a close. The
strain of the long night-watch, however, imposed
a fatal strain on Ryan’s excitable mind.
Brisbane Newspaper Co., in whose interest
0, H. Buzaeott has destroyed his health, and at
whose instance he has become insolvent, held a
meeting to sympathise with him; and, as a crown-
ing evidence of their solicitude, asked him by
special resolution to accept “the Yost type-writer
at present in his custody, as a small token of the
co.’s hearty desire for his welfare!” Which re-
minds The Bulletin of the railway contractor
who, when a navvy was killed by a tunnel-blast,
graciously presented the widow and orphans with
—his old shovel!
Kowalski’s “Marche Hongroise,” which
every budding pianist thumps for octave study,
has reached a circulation of 700,000,-an almost
incredible sale. The composer sold the copyright
for .£2O. Recently an English music-publishing
firm printed a “simplified edition,” being a
horrible mutilation of the original., Kowalski
wrote indignantly from Sydney, complaining of
the vandalism. The firm wrote a most polite
reply, assuring him that they thought the com-
poser was dead long ago. On receipt of this, the
genial composer exclaimed —“But, good gracious,
I am not dead ; absolutely.”
A parable for the talkative Chief-Justice
Madden, and the facts;are,true as taxes. There
was a Maoriland Judge who delighted to lecture a
condemned prisoner for an hour after the verdict,
but one day, just as he started his oration, a voice
from the dock said, “ Look here, Judge, none of
your (vermilliori) jaw. The worst (pink) penalty
the law provides is bangin’. I’m booked for that,
and you’re got no (red ochre) right to clap one of
your (crimson) sermons bn top of it. It’s
(numerous adjectives) cruelty to animals, that’s
what it is (bless) you !” That Judge never orated
again. Also, there was another Maoriland Judge
famed for terseness. His method was this:
“Prisoner, you’re found guilty of murder. You’ll
be hanged by the neck till you’re dead. Next
case, please!’’

Mr. Edward T. Costin, Homeville, West Maitland,
N.S.W., who writes on March 23rd, 1893.—I beg
to inform you that Mrs. Costin suffered for years
with very bad nervous headaches, and about two
years since they got so bad that her hair was
turning grey, and a door slamming, or anybody
entering a room suddenly, would make her start
with fear. Seeing so many testimonials- from
people who I knew would not let their names be
published unless your Clements Tonic had had the
effect they stated, I got Mrs. Costin to try a bottle.
After taking it there was a decided improvement,
and after taking a few more bottles all headache
left, and the hair resumed its original colour.
I am happy to state that, with an occasional bottle
of your Clements Tonic, Mrs. Costin is now
enjoying very good health.—I remain, dear Sir,
yours faithfully, Edward Thos. Costin, Homeville,
West Maitland, N.S.W.

Little Lissner, who damned himself politi-

Rosebery at Birmingham : “ The abolition

be like pulling a lot of polypi out of a man’s nose.
The Yic. Government and people are

At Lithgow (N.S.W.) last week a public

and 91 were in favour of—letting the legislators

Before Dublin Freeman’s Journal was
taken over by “ the party ” it returned £14,000 a

proof that a political crowd are the worst possible
persons to manage a newspaper.
The portrait of Queen Victoria, which

The N.S.W. general election is at hand.
Here you have candidate Jessop, L.0.L., publicly

Dan Yell O’Connor and Mayor Manning howl in
chorus for the release of Orange-boss Abigail.
F. B. Sutler has held political office for a
longer period than any other politician in N.S.W.

And, as he is 24 years younger than Parkes, he

S.A. Parliament meets June 7. As the
reoent elections give the Ministry a majority in
the Council, progressive land and income taxes,
with a special impost for absentees, defeated last
year, will now, unless treachery intervenes, most
assuredly pass.
The only German member of the S.A.

won in the North East.
Crown lands sold by S.A. Govt, to date

and, in addition, pay interest £32,000,000.

The Federation proposals of the various
Australian provinces recall the words of Johnson,
to an Irishman, when the Union was mooted :
“ Don’t unite with us, it would be the union of
the shark with his prey.” Each province appears
to favour Federation for what she probably could
make out of the others.
Parkes’s revelation “ for the first time” of
the late Judge Peter Faucett’s refusal of a title is
no revelation at all. A church dignitary, with
others, used what influence he possessed to induce
the old man to assent at the time, but he was
obstinate, and, unfortunately, without ever giving
full or satisfactory reasons.
Dan O’Connor’s chairman at a recen
election meeting introduced the spluttering orator
as “a miniature Plato—not a wind-bag.” This
has sent everybody to the encyclopaedia to find
out who in antiquity was Plato, that he should
deserve this ignominy, “Plato’s opinions were
very contradictory, and his philosophy exhibited
many variations.” H’rn !
All Sydney University Chancellor Man-
ning’s talk about the bursaries, &c., distributed
amongst poor students amounts simply to the fact
that patronising charity is one part of the pluto-
cratic University’s dispensation. Poverty thus
converts into a favour what is properly due as a
right. The University of a Democracy should be
free and encourage night-classes.
While Parkes, at St. Leonards, one night
lately, _bitterly reproached Dibbs and Co. with
importing personal friends into salaried positions
at the country’s expense, he happened to look in
the direction of Mr. Oscar Meyer, who enjoyed a
seat on the platform, and a maliciously-disposed
observer states that he distinctly saw two winks—
an Aryan and a Semitic—embracing in mid-air.
Editor Hogue, of Sydney Evening News,
aspires to step into llruce Smith’s shoes as
member for the Glebe in N.S.W. Parliament.
Mr. Hogue is a good old revenue-tariffist of the

prietor, is understood to have lost at least a tenner
in backing him last year for Tattersall’s tourna-
ment.

The New Australians had just landed. Our old friend Bill was there, and Jim was not
far off. A grave-looking Spanish Don rode past, and Bill (eyeing him critically) : “He ain’t

blanky New-chum,” and gave a hitch to his reach-me-down pants all the way from Barcaldine.
together according to a specific agreement, the
understanding being that if either party desire to
recede or vary the terras, a fresh conference would
beheld. In 1889, England, Germany, and the
United States similarly agreed respecting Samoa,
and one or other now seeks to vary the arrange-
ment without a new consultation.
From every pound subtracted from, the
income of the Queensland civil servant who is not
in the Education Department, it may be said that
two have been taken from the average State-
school teacher —the lowest-paid official of all. In
face of this attack on the system of primary edu-
cation, certain capitalistic M.’sL.A. propose to
introduce a bill into Parliament to establish a set
of superior schools in which their own bantlings
will be pampered on superior pap at the expense
of the State.
The treasury of the Sultan of Morocco, at
Mequinez, is said to contain £12,000,000 sterling
in coin, jewels and bullion. No wonder there is a
yearning among the European powers to annex the
Moorish kingdom. What a looting there will be
when the time comes ! And what a stupendous,
international drunk O’Donnell’s hungry troopers
lost in 1860 when they let Morocco off with an
idemnity of £4,000,000, not knowing that the
funds for the greatest burst in history were to be
had only a few miles ahead-! :
At a recent meeting held at Briagalong
(Vic.) the first resolution was :
That the reconstruction of the railway bridge at Busby
Park is a pressing necessity, and that steps should be
taken to urge its immediate reconstruction.
And the second—
That the referendum is indispensable to secure legisla-
tion likelv to benefit the masses instead of merely the
classes, aiid should be supported by our representatives
in Parliament.
Suggestive order!
According to Whitaker’s Almanac, during
the last three years the religious denomina-
tions of English-speaking races have increased
as follows; Unitarians, 100 per cent. ; Free-
thinkers, 43 per cent.; Lutherans, 43 per cent. ;
Episcopalians, 25 per cent. ; minor religious sects,
25 per cent.; “no particular religion,” 18'5 per
cent.; Congregationalists, 10'9 per cent.; Method-
ists, 9 per cent. ; Presbyterians, B'l per cent. ;
Baptists, 7 per cent. ; Roman Catholics, o'6 per
cent. The total increase of population was 15'8
per cent.
Premier Patterson (Vic.) thinks that
“ there is little difference in the moral aspect
between the bulk of registry-office marriages and
the process of jumping a broomstick.” Also, he
is inclined to think that the State, by permitting
civil marriages, is lending encouragement to im-
morality. Patterson has never been suspected of
having any definite opinions except the opinions
that are best fitted to keep him in office, and from
the above it is evident that James B. expects the
morose Sabbatarian party to keep on top for some
time longer.
Lord Salisbury says that the Rosebery
Government, instead of jerrymandering with the
Registration Bill, “ ought to do something to
remedy the sufferings of the poor.” It is one of
the most touching features of party politics that
the party which is out always thinks that the
party which is in should do something for the
poor. Also, both parties are solid on the fact that
the poor want to have something done for them,
which is charity, instead of getting into a position
to do something for themselves, which is demo-
cracy.
The opposition of Single-taxer Cotton to
the N.S.W, Betterment Bill roused up Traill,
M.L.A., to denounce “ the wooden demand for all
or nothing.” The kind of democrat who wants all
or nothing is capitalism’s best friend. No great
reform ever comes in one lump, therefore the all
or nothing man always gets nothing. he
mostly knows in advance that he will get nothing,
and generally it is exactly what he is aiming at.
The practical reformer always takes any instal-
ment of reform he can get, be it large or small,
and then reaches out for more.
Sydney Telegraph remarks, without com-
ment, that “Some of the jurymen in the case
against Montgomery and Williams think that,
though the men were technically guilty of intent
to murder, they did not in reality intend to kill.”
It is one of the most horrible features of Botany,
Bay law that it is so fixed that men can be found
“technically” guilty of a crime, which even the
jury recognises they didn’t commit, and be
technically hanged on a purely technical gallows
for it, the law being aware all the time that it was
only a technical crime after all.
Prof. Goldwin Smith
I am a Second Chamber man. I believe In a Second
Chamber —it it be a good Second Chamber. What I
complain of in the House of Lords is that during the
tenure of one Government it is a Second Chamber of an
inexorable kind, but that while another Government is
in, it is not a Second Chamber at all. The effect cl the
Lords, as it at present stands, is this, that in one case it
acts as a Court of Appeal, and a packed Court of Appeal,
against the Liberal party, while in the other case—the
case of a Conservative Government—it acts not as a
Second Chamber at all. We have two Chambers under a
Liberal Government, and in the Conservative ease W 8
have a single Chamber.
And so it is and ever will be with any Chamber
chosen or elected on Property qualification.
The Single-tax is responsible for the defeat
of Cornelius Proud, at East Torrens (S.A.). The
Labour-party were under obligations to Birks and
Proud, and to show their gratitude they Quixotic-
ally sacrificed two seats. In future, just as the
“ spot ” is barred in big billiard-matches, so will
the Single-tax be barred in the case of Labour
nominees in South Australia. Packham, the Ass
nominee who has won ex-Treasurer Playford’s seat
at East Torrens, is a political chameleon. Four
years ago be opposed Edwin Smith in the same
district as a Labour nominee, and last year he
tried again as an Independent.
“ Wingeu ” Abbott, tho bellicose N.S.W.
squatter-advocate, wrote two letters to the press
within the last week, maintaining in one that if a
prisoner who held a high position in public affairs
were entitled to a release from gaol before the
termination of his sentence, so also thieves and
swindlers from the humble ranks of life should
be released. In the other letter he argued that
the attitude of N.S.W. Legislative Council to the
Mining on Private Lands Bill was preposterous
and unjust, as the people are the rightful owners
of the minerals beneath the surface. N.B.—The
general election approaches.
Mr. E. BERTRAM MACKENNAL.
E. Bertram Mackennal, whose statue of
Circe achieved honourable mention at the Paris
Salon, and may be expected to do likewise
at,the current Royal Academy show in London,
is the 30-year-old son of Mackennal, the clever
Melbourne modeller. A dozen years ago, Mac.
fils went to England to study at the R.A., then
to Paris and Rome. Anon the young artist
returned to Melbourne for the immediate purpose
of carving two panels for the front of Parliament
House. Some other samples of his skill were
wasted upon the local authorities, who have an
awkward habit of abandoning their statue schemes
owing to want of funds, and Bertram Mackennal
had begun to feel aggrieved by his native land,
when Sarah Bernhardt came along, recognised his
genius with characteristic suddenness and incited
him to re-cross the sea as soon as possible. In
Melbourne and Sydney he worked upon a bust of
Sarah which has made its mark in Paris. The
feet of E. B. Mackennal, who, by the way, is a
poet in verse as well as in marble, are now steadily
climbing the ladder of fame, and Australia points
to his birthplace with pardonable pride. An
exceptionally clever fellow, he is also a particularly
good fellow, whom popularity will find it difficult
to spoil. Just now he pays the rates, bub other-
wise lives rent free at the toney London residence
of Mrs. Brown-Potter, that amiable goddess
having invited him to fill the premises during her
absence on tour. For a genius who thus gets into
“ the swim ” there should be a brilliant time
coming, and The Bulletin has secret misgivings
that the subject of this notice may one day lack
the strength of mind necessary to repudiate a
knighthood.
Lee and Cummins, charged with the
Barraba murder, are bo be tried at Tamworth—
nob at Sydney as formerly proposed. Dibbs is
going to stand for Tamworth, and if he deprived
that town of its sensational murder-trial, with a
possible hanging to follow, his chance would be
just about nil. A good, large, cordial murder-
case in the Premier’s electorate just before polling-
day is worth a lob of votes. Instead of shifting
the Tamworth suspects to Sydney, what the
Dibbs Govt, should do is to collect all the sus-
pects of the province and send them to be tried at
Tamworth. Then the enthusiasm would be simply
boundless.
Dear Bulletin, —Bruce Smith has not
drawn his N.S.W. Parliamentary “screw,” cer-
tainly ; neither has he handed it back to the
Treasury. If lam not mistaken, it is paid to his
credit, and may accumulate for 20 years, and be
drawn by him or his heirs in a lump sura at the
end of that period. When he -formally pays it
into the Treasury it will be time for him to get
credit for self-sacrifice. G. H. Reid actually did
this with that proportion of his Parliamentary
allowance to which he deemed himself disentitled ;
hence he may be regarded as the only M.P.
(opposed to Payment of-Members) who is possessed
of a grain of consistency.—Yours, &e., J.0.F.,
Windsor.
An angry person writes to Melb. Age pro-
testing that rich Victorian merchants benefit by
the “low” (twopenny minimum) postal rates,
whilst the poor working man is taxed to make up
the loss. The public mind is decidedly hazy as
regards post-office business. In the first place,
there isn’t a loss to make up, but a profit, so the
Eoor man is not unduly taxed in this instance,
econdly, and lastly, the people who write only
six letters a year would find the cost of corres-
pondence enormously increased were it not for the
other people who post 1 sixty, six hundred, or six
thousand times as much. 'The stamp department
is practically a co-operative business, in which the
large purchasers enable Small purchasers to get
their goods cheap.
Cable informs us that Anarchist Henry
“ maintained his bravado to the last, twice shout-
ing out on the scaffold ‘Vive L’Anarohie!’”
That was bravado, mark ! When the mediaeval
Protestants or Catholics stuck to their opinions at
the burning stake, they maintained their faith.
Like the foolish Frenchman they were always
striving'to-regenerate society by murder, and the
question as to which sect should burn tire other
was determined by circumstances. In either case
the roasted pietists became known to posterity as
martyrs. Henry is only a striking exam pi nr of
bravado. The distinction between church religion
and political religion is kindly defined for us—

The Australian Star (Sydney)' started
life as a democratic paper. Now it celebrates
Victoria’s birthday with a - long article on the
blessings of monarchy, and when it has got all the
old, stale, exploded platitudes off its chest it com-
placently observes : “To our opponents there only
now remains the stock objection—that the heredi-
tary principle may place a fool on the Throne.”
Which reminds The Bulletin of a small, stunted,
aggressive atheist of five-feet nothing—a narrow-
chested person with watery eyes and goggles—
whom it once met with in a suburban hall, This
person—he was about 19—held forth in a shrill
voice for ten minutes or so, and then remarked :
“ Having thus conclusively abolished the Deity,
we will now consider various other aspects of the
case.” It is always the smallest-sized man who
abolishes the Deity in ten minutes.


“ Mrs. Lane; whq a fo/eek-or two ago returned!
to Australia and ■yfhq Wnow in Sydney anxiously]
awaiting instructions frqm Paraguay, has yielded tq I
the press her friends and furnished
an account from her .own standpoint of,
the. troubles* that have followed in thejl
wake of the expert |
ment. If is not,
cheerful reading, but
it> is certainly a valua-
able contribution to
the history of com-
munistic settlement.”
‘ ‘•The first unpleasantness,’ says Mrs. Lane, 1 was
Occasioned /by the illness of two children, whose
parents had so little care for the peace and happiness
of the community that they stolidly refused to see
''that whooping - cough was a sufficient reason for the
- removal of their family from the 1 camp ’ in Balmain.
Thi4 man and .the father of the children down with
Mrs. Lane regards as the harbingers
tof disaffection. They lost ho opportunity of spreading
distrust in her husband.”/

“ A good deal of capital haS been made out of the*order
issued during the voyage that single girls were not to go on
deck after dark. Before postmg up the notice to that effeel,
Mrs. Lane says that her husbahd obtained the grateful concur-
rence of the mothers of‘the girls to whom it was intended to
apply.”
<« At a)l events, the regulation gave rise to a vast
« mount of indignation ”
]/ G/JfCSJgtuitfafy
/Petv/v sfftii? s /
“ One yeung lady tore the notice
flown and danced Jipon it.”
“ The order was general I v
disobeyed,”
•‘Then <ame the, question of-whether
the chairman’s power was to be upheld or
not."
(Indeed, during the voyage, to convince
nimself that he really was boss of the show,
he took a vote on the subject from time to 1
time.)
“ At a general, meeting, which Mr.
Lane was too ill through the effects of
sea-sickness, overwork, and worry to
attend, it -was decided by a majority
that he was not to be obeyed.”
“He felt that they had made a mistake at the dutee*
**by painting their picture in too bright a key.’
“ A large committee was
appointed to- draw out
a general plan of action.
lt decided that there should he departments
of forestry, agriculture, building, gardening, etockirearing, pro-
vidoring, fishing, hunting, and education.” it,is surprising how
many were willing to go, into the department of fishing.
“When the mar-
ried couples, with
the children* 'and
baggage, arrived,
and found that the
single men had pitched tents for them on elevated
ground, several of the malcontents declared that
they were not goings to have their tents pitched
just where the association liked, and straightway
proceeded to take them down and pitch them
some little distance away in a hollow, where, as
might have been expected, with the first heavy
rain they found themselves paddling in 2ft. of
water.”
“ On board ship an
Argonaut, when sick,
uttered a dying in-
junction, to
that he did not want
to be buried at sea;
he wanted to be
‘ pickled.’ ”
“ Two women who had obtained
some pieces of dress material from
the association, parted with them.
In the meantime, whilst their mates
were" living on pioneer fare, they had
been dining off/
roast fowl ”(

On the settlement,

“ When the ship dropped anchor, it was deemed
necessary for someone to go ashore to communicate-with
various people, A few of the passengers went ashore,
and came back more or less,, the worse for drink; four of j
them, indeed, Mrs. Lane says, ‘ roaring ’ drunk.’
It was time for Lane to put his foof d3Jv.ll.
So lie took another “ plebiscite.’'
A lady and her daughter, who had been ap-
pointed to the educational staff of the colony, ignoring
the settlers’ children, rushed off to the native huts, and
there amused themselves in an attempt to teach the
Indian children English.”
“ Upon arrival at Asuncion,
the single men, accompanied by
the married men without families,
took the first train to Villa Rica.
Upon arrival there, however,
says Mrs. Lane, to the intense
disgust of the majority of the party, some half-dozen
men declared themselves unable to accomplish the
remaining 30 miles on foot, and declined point-blank
to make the attempt,” They took a plebiscite, and
decided that Lane should call cabs. L
Mr. Lane and about 60 followers have
withdrawn from the original settlement,
At last accounts he had taken a plebiscite.

Dear Bulletin,— Your correspondent,
“ T.M.,” says: “It is humorously pathetic to
see in tradesmen’s windows in Mildura notices to
the effect that ‘ orders will be taken on” several
firms.” So it is. The Mildura man “ gives an
order ” for everything he wants —clothes, groceries,
grog, furniture, rent, horse-feed, board and
lodging. Lately there were some weddings here.
One bridegroom gave the local jeweller an “order”
for the hymeneal ring; another, at the conclusion
of the ceremony, handed the parson an “ order ”
on one of the firms. There is now no other
original way left to locally utilise paper currency
unless we put an “ order ” for sixpence in the
plate o’ Sundays.— Nat.

Exuberant loyalty got a nasty jar in Bris-
bane, the other day, at a religious garden-party.
Lady Norman, who was to open the show, did
not turn up to time, but the wife of a well-known
wine-and-spirit-man did, with the carriage-clatter
that beseems vice-royalty, whereupon the string
band struck up “Gorsave,” to the horror of some
and the delight of others. The.“ cream ”of Aus-
tralian society don’t seem to recognise that
“ Gorsave” is merely played to male Excellencies,
and that lady Excellencies who open bazaars, &c.,
must, as a matter of strict etiquette, be received
with “D’isy ” or “ Molly and 1 and the Baby.”

It was a long, long time ago in the far, far
North. He was an M.L.A. out shooting in the

“ I’ll trouble yez to hand over the gun, sorr ! ”
commenced the guardian of the laws. “ How
long have you been in the district? ” queries the
shooter. “Two months!” was the answer.
“ You’ve been here too long—you want a change,
my friend,” said the legislator blandly. And he
got it.

A woman swore in Sydney Divorce Court
the other day that she went to a local clergyman
to take the pledge, but what she saw there—a
bottle of brandy on the table, a bottle of wine on
the piano, and cakes lying about—so impressed
her with the mockery of the thing that she did not
repeat the words of the pledge after the minister.

Victoria is having its
little boom in illicit-still
seizures, but there is no
talk of prosecuting publi-
cans who sell the unlawful
poison when it is distilled.
If there were no market for
this home-made whisky, the
manufacturers would have
to drink it up themselves,
and the crime would work
its own cure. That is to
say, the illicit stillers would
die. N.B.—What rot-gut
poison is being sold on

The Chinese Mission Hall is now in full
swing in Little Bourke-street, Melb. On week
evenings good Christian young ladies go down to
teach John to read and write English, and on
Sundays they give him liberal doses of Scripture.
He sneezes at the Scripture, but finds the young
ladies “ welly ni.” Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat,
at the dedication of this new gospel-shop, said that
“China was the only country in which slavery
had never existed, and the proportion of criminals
to the population there was only one-tenth of the
proportion in our country.” Which explains why
a thin missionary, with spectacles, farewells to
China every month with a great display of enthu-
siasm, while the poor Caucasian languishes un-
cared-for with nobody to tell him about Jonah.
# # «
The Sydney lost-dog question is being
dished up again in all its richly-flavoured aspects.
The lost dog administration goes on this plan. The
Corporation dog catchers arrest canine waifs and
strays on the simple principle that any dog which
can be overtaken and captured is a stray, and any
dog which can’t be overtaken isn’t. The animals
are confined together in a narrow pit where some
are suffocated, or chewed to death, or generally
mashed underfoot, and the remainder acquire all
the aggregate contagious diseases of the crowd.
After 24 hours the least valuable of the dogs are
killed by a simple and chaste, not to say beauti-
fully humane and Botany Bay-like, process of
pounding on the head with an iron bar, and the
others are held over for further consideration.
When the man with the bar is an expert he brains
each dog with one sickening thud; when
he isn’t an expert-ugh! The deceased are
then collected and carted to a boiling-
down establishment, where their fat is made
into soap. Therefore, the Sydney man washes
himself with old diseased terrier or mashed
Towzer. The lean of the boiled-down remains
goes for duck-feed, and the duck lays many eggs
on this dog-nourishment, and man eats the eggs
in a peacefully contented fashion, unaware that
the lank and leprous pup is the real foundation
thereof. Whether any of the dog-fat is turned
into oleomargarine or lard no one knows—possibly
it is. Anyhow, The Bulletin staff has abjured
eggs, and it scrubs itself now with a brick.

The last words of one well-known Mel-
bournian re another land-boom magnate were brief
and to the point. “Blank is a scoundrel,” said
the dying man, and straightway he departed for
the place where such remarks have to be justified.
“Tarbrush” Woods, M.L.A., on his death-bed
merely blamed himself for acting as another
man’s dummy, but even that small incident
may have struck a chill to many souls now insol-
vent. It is not well to be cursed or complained of
by one whose brow grows clammy, and whose
glazed eyes are looking their last at a sinful world.
A considerable number of Melbourne’s bruised
idols can take it for granted, however, that their
names will be mentioned from time to time by
faint, accusing voices from the bed-clothes. If
perchance one of these shrivelled fat men casually
shivers it is because a moribund dupe murmurs,
“ Blank is a scoundrel ! ”

Sea voyage and rest may prove the sal-

up to concert pitch. Certain tough virgins of the
press never fail to be shocked by “ Charley’s ”
cuddlesome ways, but it is only fair to mention
that the poor fellow’s amorous rushes have belied
his feelings many a time and oft. He did a good
deal of it to oblige the management, and was fre-
quently a martyr to his art. Just when Ryley
has appeared to put his very soul into his eager
lips he was really kissing under silent protest.
For there are always two females concerned in a
theatrical embrace —the divinity as seen by the
audience, and the girl as she is viewed by the
actor. Ryley doesn’t like all of ’em, but he acts
as though he did. His self-sacrifice is at times
truly noble, and, therefore, not understandable to
women. An actress never falls enthusiastically
upon the chest of a man who is distasteful to her.

Dear Bulletin, —In the discussion on the
“morals ” of Paula Tanqueray, this view has not
yet been stated : Abstractly , the sin of unchastity
is no greater for the woman than for the man;
but, relatively, her guilt is increased twofold by
the fact that in committing this particular sin, the
woman betrays the trust which the State places in
her in making every woman the guardian of her
own virtue. In the East, the woman is nob held
responsible for her actions, and is locked up. The
absolute fidelity—forced, if Eastern ; voluntary, if
Western—of the woman is part of the bed-rock on
which civilised society is built up. Man must
protect himself against confusion of offspring,
and let the newly-emancipated sex remem-
ber this that a gradual lowering of the
standard of “morality” may lead us back-
words to the Yashmak and the Harem.
No man can palm off on a woman a child that is
not her own, whereas “it has been many an
honest man’s hap,” says Fielding “to pass as the
father of children which are none of his.” Of
course, we may at the present time, for anything
we know to the contrary, be pressing forward to a
glorious Socialistic Millennium of Phalansteries
and Free Love, in which the very wisest child will
not be able—nor willing—to recognise his own
father ; but until that change in the nature of man
takes place that he shall cease to care about pre-
serving the homogeneousness of his offspring, the
relative standard of chastity fof tliO two sexes will
be pretty much what It Id at present.—Yours
OiESAR’s Wife. ’

Sydney E. News, obituarising Edmund
Yates, says that—
The society journal at its best is no great things. At
its worst, in its niter shallowness, its incessant person-
alities, and its eternal chatter about little things, it has
really been one of the most offensive, as well as melan-
choly, developments of our time.
To appreciate this solemn truth it is only neces-
sary to read the “society ” report printed in the
Town and Country Journal and “lifted” into
the JSvening News—a chronicle wherein are re-
counted the glories of the bailiff’s tea-party, and
how Miss Smith “was much sought after,” and
“ looked nice as usual.”

A Brittlebank, who is almost as enthu-
siastic a correspondent as that other ex-argonaut,
Pope, writes re Rue Australia :
The buildings on the settlement are not fit for beasts to
herd in, and the standard of decency is so low as to even
shock those of the densest sensibilities. The Australian
press should bestir itself in denouncing the scheme, and
do all in its power to prevent young girls coming here.
This is no place for respectable women.
Which probably means that some of the settlers
are beginning to keep harems and practise a modi-
fied form of polygamy. Man is polygamous by
nature, and when he gets away from civilisation
his very first desire is to keep a harem. The
reason why, in most cases, he only does it when he
gets away from civilisation is that the world can’t
struggle out of the old groove; therefore, if he
starts his harem openly in his old haunts he will
be blasted by the criticism of other people, who
mostly feel the same way that he does, but don’t
like to admit the fact. But if he and his critics
could all get away from public observation
together they would mostly go the same road.
The desire to keep a harem is practically incur
able.

An up-country M.L.A. had got half-way
through, dinner in a Sydney restaurant one day
lately when he found that he had no money. He
explained matters to the waitress, and assured her
it was all right, but she, who had smiled winningly
at him while he planted his beef and potatoes,
suddenly soured and said “TJm!” In a second
she returned with a bigger girl, and the M.P.
again proceeded to explain the situation, adding
that he would return next day. Both said “Um !”
at this stage and backed out of view, but imme-
diately reappeared in company with a third and

Dear Bulletin, —You

Tanqueray’s suicide, which
he calls “ the last word of
indictment against the cruel

of your sexual code.” Now
in the name of brutal frank-

with Paula? She hints her-
self that she would have
been all right could she

had been all right (for want
of a better word) she would
have met Mrs. Cortelyon’s

enough. But her whole

had arranged that her early
debaucheries should inca-
pacitate her for maternity—
“I know I can never have
a child,” wails the poor
wretch. “A God of Mercy.”
Pah ! how the phrase must
have stunk in her nostrils.

Then he doffed his glossy “topper,” hid his bald-
ness in a cap,
Donned a wrap, and reared his heels up, blew a
cloud, and sat at ease.
From the prow I gazed upon him. “Here’s a good
old sort,” I said,
As he beamed with calm enjoyment on an
illustrated page;
But presently he started, and the bland content-
ment fled
From his ruddy face, and left it blank, perplexed,
then black with rage.
He looked once more and snorted, and then down
upon the deck
He hurled the paper, cursing in a way that gave
me pain.
For an hour at least his mutterings of wrath he
could not check,
And I watched him through the journey, and he
never smiled again.’
“ Alas ! ” me thought, “ what bigots are these
men of means and weight,
How intolerant, how selfish, and how narrow in
their view.”
I secured the tattered journal, and my eye fell on
the date,
It was set forth on the cover—“ Sydney, April,
’92.”

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY ia primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy ia not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be.
cot for sevenpence • but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes- along and offers it for
sevenpence then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

Dear Bulletin, —The colour of the cuticle
is nothing. The other day I took the wife and
boys for a picnic. We bad to cross a swamp,
lined with vegetable-gardens. We ventured to
intrude on one. “There’s no thoroughfare here,”
growled a menacing white face when we got half
through. We pled hard ; two miles round by the
road. “Now, you go back.” We went sorrow-
fully ; tried a Chinaman next door. He led us
pH through his garden, smiling so sweetly that we
bought two melons we didn’t want. Why doesn’t
the white hawker succeed ? Because he isn’t white

Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent,
“Banshee,” is out in his facts about women
medical students in Melbourne. Melb. Hospital
did not establish a boycott against women medicals.
Its committee did not refuse them ; it only pointed
out that it might nob make for modesty for men
and women students to mix together in hospital
work during their studentship. Anyone who has
spent a morning in the out-patient department of
a big hospital will easily understand why. The
committee suggested that perhaps the Alfred
Hospital might take the women, while Melb.
Hospital took the men. Everybody considered
the idea good so it was pub into effect. Nor was
there even any undertaking that the women should
confine themselves to obstetrics or diseases of
women and children. For without full work and
full certificates they could nob legally receive
diplomas. As to the Melb. Hospital committee’s
refusal to have women residents, the cause is nob
prejudice, but the fact that the accommodation
for the resident medical officers is far too limited.

A pronounced Yic. parson is fulminating
against civil marriage which he Stigginsmatises as
“ legitimised immorality.” The Registry-office
charges a few shillings for the “fixing” process,
the Church extorts as many pounds. Which,
then, offers the greatest to mar-
riage, and, per centra, which the greatest incentive
to immorality ? For it is only those unions which
need encouragement that become immoral if they
remain informal. The fact is, the depression is
driving people to the registry-offices where they
cun be “spliced” cheaply, independently and
effectually. True, the Church will reduce the
charge if required, but in making a reduction it
always wears its blackest scowl.

some of its attractions.” From which any

A GOOD STOVE.
A WORD OF CAUTION.
Everyone knows what a good stove is—at least,
the women do; and every woman knows that, of
all the treasures of the household, a really first-
rate, reliable cooking-stove is the greatest desider-
atum in a house, A great many stoves are
advertised every year, many of which are like
jerry-built houses—thrown together to sell A
word of caution is therefore necessary to intending
buyers, because there are few things so annoying
and vexatious as to buy a stove and then find that
it does not possess all the qualities that are neces-
sary to give complete and-lasting satisfaction.
Now, the points in choosing a good stove are:
1. Strong cast-iron frame.
2. Good draught,
3. Facilities to burn either wood, coal, or
even turf.
4. Simplicity of parts, and thus, easy to clean.
5. Duplicate parts kept in stock, so that
breakages can be replaced at small cost
and without delay.
And if, in addition to these five points, you can
get a stove that, is also an .ornament, to the kitchen,
all the better. ■
Price, of course, is a point, but that is a matter
which need scarcely be mentioned, since, if the
above points are combined in any stove, it would
be cheap at any price within reason.
It only remains for us to say that, with con-
fidence, we can honestly recommend The

and Co., 250 George-streeb, Sydney, from =63 10s.
upwards, as one that fully and entirely fills the
bill.” . . . ..

The Sydney Telegraph’s sensation about
how the one industry which Protection has created
in N.S.W.— i.e., the sugar-growing business—only
pays the white employes 16s. a week, has got
another knock. First of all, it was announced that
the wages were 16s. and rations; now it further
transpires that the minimum wage paid by the
largest and most prosperous sugar co. is really 205.,
with board and lodging. Therefore, the Tele-
graph now rises to demonstrate that men could be
got at a cheaper rate than this ; consequently, the
wage above-mentioned is really, to a great extent,
an act of charity ; and, as a further consequence,
Protection is a pauperising institution and half-
brother or so to the Benevolent Asylum. Which
practically amounts to the statement that if Pro-
tection pays 16s. a week, it is a curse because it
puts down wages when it shouldn’t do so; and
when it pays what is equivalent to about double
that amount, it is a curse because it puts up wages
when it needn’t do so.

BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQUALLED.
CLEMENTS TONIC is a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the vocations
of every day life, is a prompt and safe remedy for
neuralgia, nervousness, weakness, debility, liver
complaint, dropsy, and chronic indigestion.
FLETCHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia and all complaints
of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly tested
in all the hot countries of the world. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all people.
Evidence is forwarded free on receipt of name and
address that will satisfy the most sceptical as to
their virtues. They are sold everywhere, but care
must be taken that the genuine are obtained or
the money and time are wasted and the disease so

My Dear Moorabinda—
The Queen’s Birthday parade of N.S.W. troops
took place in the Centennial Park under the
glassy eye of Gov. Duff atop of a bright bay gee
and sporting a silk hat and phenomenally-short
stirrup leathers —to make his balance true, I sup-
pose. The dazzling appearance of “Uncle” in
“ purple and gold ” (to speak with poetic license)
certainly justified the current whisper that in re-
forming the millinery of the military he has only
taken the trimming off the staff and added it to
his own king-parrotish glories; however, looking
at it with the petrified philosophy of an unaffected
person, it seems only right the leading man should
have the pick of the wardrobe if but to encourage
the others. It is so fortifying to the raw recruit
to think that four thick rows of tinsel round his
coat tails and a hat like a three-cornered tart are
possibilities that every Australian soldier carries
in his knapsack.
I think the Review is going off as a society
spectacle. A mere handful of carriages turned
out on Thursday, but whether the financial pres-
sure of the times has set people on their feet
again, or whether the Highland Regiment has
lost its fatal fascination for Sydney belledora, I
am at a loss to determine. But the absence of a
crush in the vice-regal enclosure was balanced by
the absence of a crush in the field, where the com-
ponent parts of the display were city and suburban
soldiers ; the Military Estimates not running to
the wholesale importation of the bush-whacking
aspects of local valour.
Some of the horses might have been fresh
caught from Jamberoo by their appearance. One
chalk-coloured charger had its shoulder skinned,
and another grey horse was strawberry-coloured
witli dried mud. When “Uncle ” was starring in
the provinces he spoke up sharply about the door-
mat appearance of most of the country troop-
horses. He objected to bare-ribbed frameworks,
with hairy hoofs and chronic depression of spirits,
supporting the equestrian glory of our “Horse”
on their unkempt backs, and I certainly looked
for shaven fetlocks at least all along the line at
the Review. Here and there one saw evidences
of careful strapping, and sometimes the gee was
better-looking than the rider. One concave-
chested warrior had a very broad-chested mount;
and, talking about hollow chests, one officer’s
“chuck” had slipped to his belt, and it played
the very Falstaff with his silhouette.
Madame Lucien Henry’s monthly reunion at
her class-room, 289 Pitt-street, the other Tuesday,
took the improving shape of a compact and
clearly-enunciated lecturette by Madame Henry
on “ Millet,” rendered light and airy by music and
tea and good engravings of the painter’s best
works, which were handed round during the
lecture. By the way, I don’t think Art moves in
a very mysterious way for local society, which loves
the pink and white maiden hugging a pug dog in
its secret heart, and sees no rugged beauty in King
Billy, For example, Madame Henry showed one
engraving of a peasant’s head—an “ugly” study,
but full of force and genius and a savage ideality.
Yet more than half the audience looked at it and
grinned.
The Barracks broke out into a military tattoo on
Queen’s Birthday eve. I hope the military will
make a point of tattooing from time to time, as
Sydney is a place absolutely gasping for more band-
music under the silent stars, especially in the
spring and summer. But the evening breeze of
May isn’t just the sort of temperature one feels
envious of sitting out in, and I am sure that a
large section of the muffled-up women in front of
the officers’ quarters must have yearned to warm
their feet and hands at the flaming flambeaux.
The members of Sydney University Dramatic
Society were more stereotyped than usual in the
pieces they put up at Sydney Royal Standard
Theatre the other evening. “Time will Tell ”
isn’t such a literary fossil as the compact U.D.S.
usually faces you with, and Gilbert’s “Creatures
of Impulse” is strictly modern. It is highly pro-
bable the stock of nice, decent old comedies, suit-
able for young amateurs, has given out and left
the society to the flabby mercies of modern insi-
pidity, but I hope there are one or two dramatic
bald-heads left to act as buffers between this clever
society and plays like “ Withered Leaves.”
In the fairy comedy Miss B. Roper Elliott
talked like May Pollard and acted in her usual
competent fashion. Mr. A. B. Davies, as a bold
warrior, was somewhat oppressed by a misfit bald-
head, but he divided the histrionic honours with
Miss Elliot all the same, and the whole comedy,
smartly dressed and with “ real pigeons ” on a
roof, went very gaily to the crisp strains of the
Post-office band.
The main dish was the comedy “Time will
Tell,” in which the greenest laurels were achieved
by Mr. Gregan M'Mahon, as the wicked, but
airy, French count. From the top-look of his
frizzy black wig to his crimson socks, Mr.
M'Mahon was cleverly made up, and his acting
most convincing throughout. His badly-broken
French accent was unerring, too, which is a point
quite a number of “ dialect ” professionals fre-
quently fail to make. Pretty Miss Caro, as two
separate varieties of damsel, was lady-like and
effective throughout, and Miss Ethel Paige made a
housewifely maiden of the heiress, and achieved
the rare theatrical phenomenon of a real blush
behind the footlights.
Of the LL.B.’s and other savants engaged in
the mimic show, Mr. Pickburn as a lord, Mr.
D. W, MTntyre as a breezy manufacturer, and
Mr. Garnsey as a martyr, played like old stock
actors who scent a cue a mile off, and the only
people who rather got on one’s nerves were the
“Duke,” who roared like a sucking lion, and the
Attorney, who didn’t. Mr. Charles Burford
coached the players, and he deserves the best
quality of all-wool praise for his part of the
business.
No strictly truthful person could assert that the
Birthday meeting of Sydney Turf Club at Rand-
wick was a smart and successful function —on the
second day, at least. For one thing, autumn
frocks have lost their edge in merry May, and the
world doesn’t trot out its winter tackle until the
A.J.C. midwinter meeting crops up. Obviously
Lady Duff hadn’t donned her new winter turn-
out. She wore a plain dark-blue skirt and a
summer mantle of black lace, the whole topped by
the inevitable toque, a size too large, of black
velvet, trimmed in a rakish way with black
feathers out of curl and a sort of plaster of
autumn leaves in front. It was the kind of top-
ping-off one associates with (let me be candid,
for once) a check shawl and a jug of beer, though
mow the style is under Y.R. patronage I suppose
■it holds a higher place in coeval millinery.
A feature on the lawn was the A.D.C.’s fiancee
i(in pale-grey and silver and hints of heliotrope
velvet), nestling under her captive’s wing. The
Major-Generaless wore a gown the colour of
peat-smoke; Mayoress Manning, a cosy-looking
dress of broken checks, draped over seal-brown
velvet and bordered with brown fur, small green
bonnet. Green —bright caterpillar green—is
■coming in, so a golden-haired society girl wore it
cap d pie. In the distance she reminded me that
there is a green hill far away. Another lady wore
green brilliantly lit up with the now fashionable
scarlet geranium. Mrs. (Major) Rennie’s strong
point was her three-quarter cloak of velvet and
cloth bordered with sable. Mrs. Brough wore
quaker-grey and a small black bonnet, and sat on
the grand-stand near a brother-professional who
is the proud possessor of about the most artful
wig I ever saw.
I sat behind him at a theatre once and
thoroughly entered into the ingenuity of his
artful top-knot. You will have seen that when a
man takes his hat off the hair is pressed down
where the inner rim goes ? Well, that’s where bis
wig commenced. There were no clumsy finishinga-
off round the nape of the neck, and in the event
of a red Indian scalping him the process would be
very elementary. The possible savage would just

Miss Ada Bell’s “Flowerland’ Festival and
Dramatic Entertainment takes place in Sydney
Town Hall early in June —admittance one shilling
or by “Flowerland ” art union ticket which gives
the holder a chance of getting one of “ Flower-
land’s” charming pictures. lam not at liberty to
anticipate the programme, but the Festival will
be a complete novelty, and the art union tickets
are selling quickly.
Other June fixtures are the ball in aid of that
worthy society, the Fresh Air League, whose
work is explained in the title. The ball is dated
for next Wednesday, the 6th inst., in Sydney
Town Hall, and, judging by the ticket sale, the
whole lawn intends to be present. The Univer-
sity ball on 21st, and the ball in aid of Tempo
refuge on 26th, both of which occur in the Town
Hall, are all June fixtures. To-night (Thursday)
the dance in aid of the Servants’ Home in Char-
lotte Place eventuates at Paddington Town Hall
in the presence of Lady Duff, and deserves to be
largely attended. Mrs. Bowden-Smith is Presi-
dent, and the tickets are only ss. each.
I had the pleasure, the other day, of hearing Miss
Fitz-Stubbs play her smooth new waltz, “The
Orlando,” after which I don’t wonder at its
having reached its second edition already. There
is a wonderful sequence in the melodies —each
movement seems to be the complement of the
other. By the way, somebody tried to jump the
title of “The Orlando,” but Mrs. Woods, by
rushing thro’ a printer’s edition and selling a few
copies, “got ahead.” “In future,” she says, “I
will make a missing-word of my title till the day
of issue,”
Day was made hideous as usual on 25th May
by the Birthday levee at Sydney Government
House, when the air was darkened with velvet-
lined, fur-trimmed officials and the “ general
public,” which latter went up in their willie-
wagtails, at 3 p.m., and tried to look as if,it
wasn’t a strain on their loyalty. Judging by the
published lists the crowd was indeed a representa-
tive one, ranging from the Chief Justice to the
sparkling corner-man at a variety-show—who, I
am told, was the only suggestion of corks in the
tedious and thirsty function.
The levee is another proof of what a rosy time
women have. When vice-regality gives a mixed
day-reception provender is carried about all the
afternoon, but when a he-function blocks the
social way there isn’t a biscuit from Dan to Beer-
sheba. I think this famine system of reception
must have a weakening effect on the loyalty of the
male bird, which requires much more bolstering
up than does the deeply-rooted monarch-worship
of women, who give away their frantic adoration
of the Throne and Person with or without a cup
of tea. And yet man’s tongue cleaves to the roof
of his mouth in his loyal moments, while woman
is bailed up by waiters with sponge-cakes.
What is the secret of the effervescence which is
always in the air at French functions ? The over-
crowded ball in aid of the Bienfaisance Frangais
at Paddington Town Hall, the other Wednesday,
was no exception, although the countless dancers
trod on one another’s toes, and Lady Duff looked
wearily amiable in a gown we have all admired (o r
aa the case may be) dozens of times. But there
was no getting away from the sparklesomeness of
the thing, and though Society (which was largely
represented) had come without its diamonds (you
pile on the jewellery according to the price you
pay for your ticket), there were many fetching
garments in evidence. Madame Tauveron (hon.
sec.) wore an indescribable gown that impressed
you with its Parisian elegance, and so did her
coadjutor, Madame de Bissel. At the same time
I couldn’t tell you what the colours were. It is
always difficult to reduce a really well-dressed
woman to black and white. You are only conscious
of effect.
Madame Kellermann’s scarlet silk toilet, with a
coquettish tuft of tri-colour feathers in her hair,
was a bright spot in the crowd, and in Such a
crowd it was wisdom to wear primal colours.
Women in pinky-whitey hues are absolutely
unseen in a crowded room, and I just caught sight
of Brenda Gibson in white satin and a white
gardenia in her hair dancing the lancers with Mr.
1 ranklyne, who appeared to have just stepped out
of “ Lady Windermere’s Fan ” —by-play and all.
Miss Dudlay also aired her massiveness in the
same set, and wore a pinky frock with ribbons, A
lady in green, with her hair powdered, must have
known she would look like a leek, and somebody
with a figure like a coast-lizard unsagely wore a
tight fit. In an age like this, of Grecian draperies,
even a female Punch needn’t reveal the hump,
unless she chooses. By the way, so elated are the
committee at the success of their dance that next
year the Sydney Town Hall, with double-priced
tickets, will be the order of march.
If the vice-regal people turn up much later than
they are in the habit of doing at public balls, the
committee will do well to put the opening V.R.
set of lancers four numbers before supper instead
of at the top of the card. At the French ball, the
company was panting after several dances before
the Guvmentouse people turned up and “ opened
the ball,” as the shibboleth goes. As a matter of
vulgar fact, that ball had opened itself very cheer-
fully an hour or two before. The chronic un-
punctualities of their Excellencies the Duffs
almost looks as if they didn’t dress for dinner.
At the Melbourne Birthday Review, says a
correspondent, although there was a great attend-
ance the manoeuvres did not elicit a single cheer.
Had the soldiers all been building-society secre-
taries and land-company directors they could not
have been regarded with greater apathy by the
crowd, for whom they provided a very decent
show.
I hear from Melbourne that the small attend-
ance at Lord Hopetoun’s levee, on Queen’s Birth-
day, was an acknowledgment of His Excellency
and Lady Hopetoun’s prolonged absence from the
metropolis. For the evening party a thousand
were invited, and a third of these didn’t turn up.
The Hobart levee was the largest and the Mel-
bourne one the smallest in those respective cities
for several years.
An unusual circumstance was responsible for
many people enjoying the privilege of private
entree at Gov. Hopetoun’s shivoo last week. At
the ball-room entrance a butler and orderly found
they had a dispute that would not permit of ad-
journment, the result being that the former “ got
home with one in the eye” of the latter, who
rolled down the steps with a bang. A posse of
policemen were soon on the scene, and to keep
matters quiet they directed all the approaching
carriages to proceed to the private entrance, while
the white-card guests wondered why so unexpected
an honour had been done them.
I hear that a certain accomplished and pushing
professional gentleman of somewhat South-Sea-
idol-ish appearance has just become engaged to a
very pretty Northern blonde, nearly related to a
British political magnate.
Yours apprehensively.

If the Irishmen of Gipps Division of West
Sydney “vote en bloc for Dan O’Connor against

As the rival sections of N.S.W. Labour
party seem utterly unable to establish a reasonable
modus vivendi, why don’t they toss up re the
nomination of a candidate in every constituency
where dog is trying to eat dog? Take Clark and
Holman, for instance. Neither can possibly get
in while Hawthorne, with united Property at his
back and a good personal following, is in the way.
The means employed to convict the
burglars Montgomery and Williams on the
capital charge of wounding with intent to murder
were almost as dubious as those employed to
convict and hang the Mt. Rennie prisoners. The
action of N.S.W. Crown Law Office, which, in
defiance of every vital principle of public policy,
filed only one count, a capital indictment, against
the desperadoes, instead of arraigning them under
the section specially provided to meet such
cases, would, in any court of arbitration, be
set down as the sharpest of sharp practice, and
utterly unworthy of any sphere save, perhaps, the
pawnbroking or time-payment-furniture business.
It was the Crown’s duty to render the burglars’
conviction certain if they were guilty. By filing
the capital indictment, instead of one involving
life - imprisonment, and allowing the jury no
medium course, it challenged them to acquit
the men altogether. They did not acquit—but
the end of that prosecution in no way justified
the means.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Editor Bulletin,—-My attention has been drawn
to a statement in this week’s issue of Tim Bulletin (p. 20),
under the head of “Sporting Notions, '* which seriously
reflects upon my character; “ Victor Cohen, manager of
the ’93 Australian Eleven, lent him (a well-known sporting
journalist) £B, but the schedule does not state whether
It came oat of Vic.’s pocket or the general funds of the
Eleven,” Now, the loan in question was made by me in
the year 1887 or 1888, I think the former, long before the
cricket-team, of which I was manager in 1893, was
thought of or organised. The implied charge as to my
having misappropriated the amount mentioned from
moneys, of which I was trustee, is, therefore, unfounded,
and I must ask you to publish in your'next issue an
explanation of and an apology for having made
the statement in question.—Yours, Victor Cohen.
Malua, Billyard Avenue, Elizabeth Bay, 23rd May, 1894.
[ln reference to the foregoing, The Bulletin can only
express its regret that the paragraph in question should
have been for one instant thought by Mr. Cohen suscep-
tible of any sinister interpretation. No suspicion of any
unworthy imputation against him was felt when the para-
graph was passed—the lines were read to convey that it
was not known whether Mr. Cohen had lent the money in
his private, personal capacity, or as manager for (and on
behalf of) the Eleven. We have to apologise if, in the
opinion of Mr. Cohen or his friends, any other meaning
can pessibly attach to a paragraph printed without the
remotest desire to reflect upon his honour.—Ed. B.]
Dear Bulletin, — You’ve published some good
yarns fc-om time to time concerning old Mossy Isaacs,
but, so far, the best remains in the bag. Here it is. and
it's a true bill. In Martini’s year an innocent-looking
“mug"asked Mossy for the double—Martini and First
Demon for the Derby and Cup. Mossy wrote the wager
in his book, the “mug” looking over his shoulder.
Mossy was then asked for a ticket, and whilst writing it
he must have had a rush of “ pickled cucumber ” to
the brain, for he wrote “ Martini and Martini, £100.” The
mug took the ticket and “never said a word.” When
the backer got a “ leg in ” with Martini, Mossy met him
and asked if he wanted to lay off First Demon. The
backer “ Never said a word, s’elp me Moses !” When the
Cup winner weighed in, Mossy was politely but firmly
asked for £lOO. Mossy replied—! I Showed his book.
Mug showed his ticket. Mossy swore like the army in
Flanders. Wouldn’t pay—it was a swindle.
Mug complained to Byron Moore. Mossy appeared ami
showed his book wherein he had entered the wager—Mar-
tini and First Demon. B.M. said : “Is that your writing
on the ticket, ‘Martini and Martini,’ Mr. Isaacs?” "Yes,”
cried Mossy, “ but it’s a mistake. I”—!—! PoorMns-y
raved and explained, but was only met with, “ Is tin.l
yourticket?” “Yes.” “Then pay!” Mossy paid. When
the mug had pocketed the century he soothed M>s<y
with—“ You know, Mossy, it First Demon had wo i
the Cup I should have claimed the wager in your book mil
lost the ticket.” The writer, as one of Mossy’s unfbi in-
nate clients, took an unholy delight in introducing people
to him with the sole object of leading him to relate bow
he was got at for a hundred. To see Mossy push back his
ancient pith helmet and relate this story with big teais in
his sad blue eyes was joj r to a backer. He invariably
finished with—“ The artfulness of the ! When 1
asked him to lay off First Demon w’ith me he never said a
word 1 ” Once there was a backer who struck Mossy for
a £2O double that Mossy picked for him—but that s
another story.—Yours, A. W.F.

Dear Bulletin, —Most rowing men admit that
the success of Victorian eight-oar crews depends much
upon the coach—George Upward. George to day literally
permeates the rowing-world of Victoria, and bestrides it
like a Colossus. He is responsible for the healthy spirit
which accepts every man as an “amateur” who rows for
the love of the sport. The manual-labourer has no im-
pediment placed in his way, and takes his chance of
selection with the bank-clerk and the civil-servant ; know-
ing that his rowing form will be the test of success, and
not the cut of his clothes, the society he moves in, or his
father’s bank-account. Were it so in N.S. Wales, the
results of these contests might be different. Upward
is also somewhat responsible for the improvements
in boats which have made Victorian boat-buildeis
invincible. I saw the other day in an English paper
that a distinguished naval-desigrter had suggested
that the seats of the Oxford and Cambridge eight-
oar boat should all be placed exactly in the centre,
and not one and one as now. This brilliant idea got into
the distinguished designer’s nut a little too late, for the
Melb. builders adopted a precisely similar suggestion
from Upward, some considerable time ago, and have long
been building their best boats on that principle. Upward
has also encouraged country clubs, and country rowers
are often included in intercolonial crews. The stroke of
the last Victorian crew was from the provinces—from
Ballarat, I think. Upward also believes that we have the
best boat-builders in the world, declares Peter Sullivan,
of Sydney, able to build wager-boats to row for a king-
dom ; asseverates that Australian timber is the best
material for best boats ; and only admits with reluctance
that Nowegian timber is indispensable for oars.
As a coach he is facile pnneeps, his great
strength being in raising the moral tone of the
whole crew, never admonishing an erring rower before
his brethren, as he is of opinion that it weakens tfie men
by superinducing a belief amongst seven that the eighth
is a passenger. When other sports are degenerating—
racing undoubtedly; cricket partially (remember the
business of the theatre-pass trophy); and football emphati-
cally—it is refreshing to find that the torch of real sport
for its own sake has been kept alight in rowing. Much
credit for this is due to the benevolent despotism of
George Upward, one of the straightest of Australian
sportsmen, whose natural modesty and repugnance to
self-advertisement will receive a rude shock when he reads
this.—Yours, &c., Cornstalk.
N.S. Wales understands eight-oar rowing.

Bogardus and Carver’s shooting has always been
looked upon as phenomenal, but during the trial of Herr
Dowe’s bullet-proof coat, in the Winter-garten at Berlin,
two experts gave some terrifying examples of their skill.
One of them screwed a rifle fast, and pointed it at an egg
suspended about 40 paces off. He then went and placed
his head under the egg and made the rifle go off by firing
at the trigger with another rifle which he held in his hand.
The same man was then placed in a wooden frame which
fitted close to his body, the edges being hung with plaster
eggs. His companion then fired with a magazine rifle at
the eggs which hung close to hiseyes, cheeks, &c. Finally,
he shot an egg off the other’s head at a distance of 100
paces, and then two eggs at the same time with two
revolvers!

The S.A. T.C.’s commission (7i per cent.) on
the totalisator receipts for the Adelaide Cup meeting
exceeded £3OOO. With the machine legalised at Fleming-
ton the Y.R.C. would speedily be able to restore the faded
glories of their Melb. Cup and increase stakes all round,
but inasmuch as the innovation would abolish the horse-
milking trade and encourage sport instead of chicanery,
the alleged sportsmen of Victoria are arrayed against it.
Some of the owners who were loudest in their outcry
against the Club’s necessary reduction of stakes are also
the determined supporters of “ books ’’ v. totalisator. It
would be interesting to get these gentlemen in a corner
and hear them attempt to reconcile their two arguments.

GIRLS OF THE RIGHT SORT.
“ My daughter, unless you can work the ship off the
coast, she will soon strike the rocks, and we shall all
be lost.”
So said the captain of a fine merchant vessel to
his daughter. He was right; it was their only
chance. The bark Anhui, 701) tons, was bound
from Cuxhaven to Rio w ith a general cargo. She
had scarcely left port when the captain was
disabled by a broken leg. A mutiny followed.
Under threat of bad weather the Anina anchored
in a bight of a bay on the dangerous coast of Corn-
wall. Here the officers and all of the crew deserted.
A furious cyclonic south-west gale arose, The
anchors dragged, and the, girl burned a flare on
deck. The lifeboat responded, but was staved
against the ship’s side by a sea. _ All the boat’s
■crew were lost except the coxswain, who gained
•the deck. He was not a sailor, yet, with him
alone under her orders, this girl, who was a sailor,
■cut both cables, set some headsail, and got out
■into the open. It was touch and go, but true grit
won. Three weeks longer the girl commanded
before help came. Yet it did come finally, and
■sodidthe wedding of the handsome youngcoxswain
and the captain’s beautiful and heroic daughter.
And yet there are some fools left who say we
must look to men chiefly for courage and intelli-
gence. Stuff and nonsense! Any woman will
scream when she sees a mouse (that’s mere nerves),
and ten minutes later she will meet disaster or
■death with a quiet smile. Then, too, women
have a genius for throwing in a suggestion exactly
when it is wanted.
A man writes this way:—“l came home de-
jected,” so he goes on, “ and didn’t know what to
■do ; but my daughter said ”
But wait a minute. Before we hear what his
■daughter said, let’s have his story from the start,
■shipshape and Bristol fashion. He says : —“ In
December, 1890, I was suddenly taken one day
with an excruciating pain in the pit of the stomach
and in the right side. For over twelve hours I
could neither sit nor lie down. The medical man
who examined me gave me some medicine, but on
the second day jaundice set in, and from that time
1 suffered from a similar attack about once every
three weeks. Every remedy was tried without
avail; nothing did the slightest good. Thekidney
secretion was something frightful, being a mass of
matter, blood, and bile.
“ This continued five months, and I grew weaker
and thinner every day. My friends thought
nothing could save me. Many urged me to have
further advice, as at this time the secretions were
much worse, and the motions resembled white
clay. Another attack came on, and as I was
daily getting worse, I said, ‘ I will see the doctor
first, and if he can do me no good, I will seek
further medical help.’
“ Accordingly I went to see him, but he was
from home, and would not return until late at
night. I came home dejected and did not know
what to do, but my daughter said, 4 Why don’t you
try Mother SeigeVs Curative Syrup? We hear it
has cured so many. If it does you no good it will
do no harm.’ ‘ Well,’ I said to her, 4 1 will try a
bottle.’
44 1 then began to take it, and oh ! how thankful
I afterwards was, for on the third day I could see
such a change. The secretion, instead of being
nothing but corruption, became clear, and the
motions a healthy colour. From that time I daily
gained health and strength, and in a short time I
was as well as ever in my life, and have had no
return of the disease.
44 1 can, therefore, speak of this medicine in the
highest terms, for, under God’s blessing, it cured
me when nothing else had the slightest effect.”
The above communication is from a business
man of high character in the county of Brecon.
Eor especial reasons he desires his name to be
■withheld for the present, but we freely pledge our
■own reputation for the truth of his statement.
The date is February 12,1892.
The attacks which would probably have soon
ended his life were of severe kidney and liver
congestion, growing out of profound indigestion
and dyspepsia. His system was flooded with bile
acid poisons, and he may thank Heaven for having
a daughter who made the right suggestion at a
critical moment. In courage and good sense she
is like the other noble girl who saved her father’s
ship from wreck while he lay helpless in his cabin.
Success attend them in their own life voyages,
say we.

The London Tory newspapers which print
such paragraphs must be run by madmen :
The appointment of the Earl of Cork to he Master of
the Horse came as a surprise to most people, as it was
generally supposed that the Marquis of Breadalbane
wanted the post. It is one of the best of the ornamental
Household appointments, as the salary of £2500 a year by
no means represents the total emoluments. A royal
carriage and pair and a couple of royal servants are
placed at the Master’s disposal, and whatever riding
horses he may require. There are several other desirable
perquisites, and the duties of the office, are practically
nil, as Sir George Maude, the Crown Equerry, does all the
work. The Master of the Horse has only to attend the
Queen at the Drawing Rooms, and give a state banquet
on her Majesty’s birthday. Lord Cork, who is known as
the best-hatted man in London—nobody has ever been
able to discover the secret of the peculiar gloss which his
tall hats always possess -is a very popular personage in
society, and will be heartily congratulated by a host of
friends.
Which in its effect is surely as treasonable as the
stuffing of Queen Victoria’s mattress with picric-
acid bombs would be.
Chief Secretary Tozer openly declares that
Q. police-magistrates are, with one or two excep-
tions, a wooden-headed lot, who are rapidly
making his hair grey. They were livelier in the
old days when each was practically despotic
sovereign of his territory. One Western stipen-
diary was hastily called once upon a time, to settle
a fight between Kanakas and Chinese. He armed
himself with a heavy hunting-crop, stuffed the
Riot Act into his saddle-pouch, and, after half-an-
hour’s gallop, went into the scrimmage promptly.
When he had “laid out” three Chinamen some-
one suggested to him to “read the Act.” The
P.M. stuttered always, and merely remarked, as
he floored two more Celestials, “ I r-r read it kuk-
kuk-coming al-along the r-r-road.” The trouble
didn’t last long after that; but one of the China-
men had the bad manners to die, and next day the
plantation overseer was run in for killing him.
The P.M. was on the bench, supported by local
J.’sP. After all the witnesses against the overseer
had finished their little stories, “ His Worship ”
descended from the bench and went into the box,
gave his evidence dead in the overseer’s favour,
returned to the bench, refused to commit, and
dismissed defendant without a stain on his
character, blandly observing that be wished to
“ kuk-kuk-complimerit the 1-I-last w-w-witness on
the s-s-straight-fuf-fuf-forward manner in which
he g g-gave h-his tut-tut-tut-testimony.”
“ Mr. Duncan Gillies, the
for Victoria, -visited Govent Garden Market, to-
day, for the purpose of examining various
methods adopted for the sale of fruit.” This
cablegram, although even more extravagantly
ridiculous than it seems, is not as innocent as it
looks. The idea that Gillies stalked round to the
market about mid-day, with a grave air and a
note-book in his pocket, for the purpose of
encouraging the fruit industry in Victoria, is
not correct. Market-morning was the time
selected for Duncan’s visit, which must have been
about as unofficial as they make ’em. Duncan
had been dining, also supping. He was “keeping
it up ” jolly late, was the Agent-General, and
very likely he was singing something he had just
heard at the ’alls, when somebody proposed—one
of the chappies with him, you know—“S pose we
go round to Covent Garden and see them unload-
ing cabbages, by Jove ! ” Gillies thereupon stuck
ids crush hat further back, and bared his crumpled
dress-shirt front to the early breath of the sweet
spring morning, saying, “My oath 1 yes, ’vanning
interests of the colony, good idea.” So the six of
them linked arms and made objects of themselves,
as many thousands of won’t-go’me-till-morning
visitors have done before them, and the market-
gardeners threw radishes at them, and low, vulgar
hawkers butted them with baskets on purpose,
and altogether Gillies and Co. finished up the
night in a sound, traditional manner. Some of the
methods of selling fruit are girls, occasionally
wholesome-looking wenches, and they were the
particular feature of the trade that Duncan
examined most.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “ Cannalin ” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
After half-a-dozen contradictions Hoolan’s
resignation for Burke (N.Q.) electorate has
actually been handed to the Speaker, and the
election comes off on June 16. Glassey didn’t
want to stand, and the Labour-party would much
prefer Hoolan to hang on, but he thinks he has
done enough for the party and must pay attention
to private affairs, which don’t prosper when one is
1000 miles away from the scene of action making
speeches on .£3 a week. Glassey will probably
have to face Lissner, the MTlwraithian Minister-
in-posse who was defeated at the Towers; Dr.
Routh, a N.Q. medico; and James Campbell, an
old Etheridge identity ; with the evergreen Billy
Little for an off-chance. By the way, a letter
from John Plumper Hoolan reached this office the
other day, which defied the united efforts of the
staff to read it until it was turned upside-down,
when it proved to be a new version of the Lord’s
Prayer mixed with curses on politics. Hoolan
was by long odds the worst writer in
Queensland Parliament, and when he sup-
plied mining items to a now-defunct paper
the comps, had to shut their eyes and follow copy
by scent, nosing it out like a dog on a bad trail.
J.P.H. is a decent fellow, but uncommonly hairy,
which gave point to Billy Smyth’s jibe (in the days
before regeneration and “ progressive euchre”)
that he made his first rise by being carried round
in a cage as the “ Wild Man from Borneo,” Any-
how, Hoolan is a loss to the Q. Labour-party ;
and, in spite of his extravagances, The Bulletin
hopes to see him back in Parliament some day.

USAGE.
AN ALARMING CAMEL ACCIDENT AT
COOLGARDIE.
Mr. William Dunn writes as follows to the
Waterbury Watch Company, Margaret-street,
Sydney, from Crystal Brook, Guyra, New South
Wales : —“ I wish to give you information in refer-
ence to the quick-winding Waterbury Watch which
I purchased at your establishment in 1892. I have
been to the centre of West Australia, prospect-
ing in new country for fifteen months. The watch
was all the time subjected to very rough usage,
but still it kept very accurate time. I was wear-
ing it when A CAMEL BOLTED WITH ME
THROUGH THE MAIN STREET OE COOL-
GARDIE. It was a young camel, and had never
been ridden before. It ran away with me, and
suddenly lay down, the shock being somewhat
similar to a railway collision ; but it never inter-
fered with the watch. I have been over there
* dry blowing’ for alluvial gold. It is one of the
most dirty kinds of work that a watch can be put
to, but it did not interfere in any way with my
Waterbury, and I must say it is A BEAUTIFUL
TIMEKEEPER—indeed, I would never think of
carrying any other. lam well known over there,
being one of the prospectors of the ‘Brilliant Gold
Reef,’2s miles north of Coolgardie. lam also a
well-known New England prospector.”

more sufferers than all others put together,” and,
considering that he has received over
100,000 Testimonials,

HERR RASSMUSSEN, PH.D.
A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Herr Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as “The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
mussen succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Alfaline Remedies, suffice it to say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in his celebrated work, “ The
Natural Doctor.”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist—his last
ten years record being so wonderful that his
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor; Ins whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially for the nerves,and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Corr. Mem', of the Academic Parisienne des
Inveuteurs, France ; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893; and in 1891 he issued his
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.

The real root of the perennial difficulty
between mistress and maid, is the feminine
character. Women are not born to be placed in
authority over, or in subjection to, each other.
1 here is no spirit of fairness in them in their
mutual relations. Men can exercise authority
over their kind—they are just to each other in all
matters, save, perhaps, where a women isconcerned;
but of tew women can as much be said, however
staunch they may be in their love affairs. If
anything can steady them it is une grande passion,
but tnen that itself is as rare as the qualities
which 1 am vaunting. Yes, women are in truth
very different creatures from men, and when they
are so misguided as to attempt to ape them,
instead of remaining on the plane where they have
been placed by Nature as the co-equals, and
neither as the inferiors nor the superiors of the
opposite sex—when they misconceive their posi-
tion to_ that extent the result is usually unfor-
tunate. ” — London Referee.
Dear Bulletin,-— As a loyal man I rejoice
exceedingly to see The Bulletin, last week, pub-
lish verses in honour of the gracious lady who
rules over our destinies. lam a poor man myself,
with a large family, but yet in my humble way
contrived to show my loyalty by reading to my
assembled family the prayers for the preservation
of the Royal Eamily, and as my dear children
were disappointed at ray inability to provide them
with fireworks, I took them to the Rev. Obadiah
Yowl man’s magic- lan tern exhibition, where, after
witnessing interesting pictures of the members of
our ever gracious Queen’s family, we were shown
quite a large picture of the flames of Hell, with
a catherine-wheel accompaniment—much more
pleasing and instructive, you will say, than fire-
works. I don’t know why I write and tell you
this, but I feel so glad after seeing your loyal
poem, last week, that I want everyone to know
how to be happy next 24th May.—Yours, A
Gotha Guelph-Jones.
Dear Bulletin, —When “H. J. M‘Oooey”
talks of “no death-adder attaining, or ever
being likely to attain, a greater length
than 32in.” he displays some of that ignor-
ance he is so ready to attribute to bushmen.
Hanging up in my office is the skin of a death-
adder, shot by me on the Wecan Creek, 20 miles
north from Inverell, which measured 35|in.
before being skinned. To convince Mr. M'Cooay
that every bushman is not “an ignorant blather-
skite,” I will forward the skin to The Bulletin
office, on the following conditions : —lf the skin is
not that of a death-adder, and does not now,
without the head and about 2in. of the tail (the
latter has dropped off) measure 3ft., I will make a
present of the skin to the Museum—it will ba of
some value. If, however, competent authorities
decide in my favour, Mr. M‘Cooey shall pay me
£lO for the skin, and keep it, and withdraw all
the venomous things he has written about bush-
men. Probably there appears a great discrepancy
between an adder 2ft. llfin. and his skin, minus
head and 2in. of tail, measuring 3ft., but Mr.
M‘Gooey’s science will tell him that in pegging to
dry the skin would stretch. I think he will
admit, though, the impossibility of stretching a
death-adder’s skin from 32in. (his limit of growth)
to about 39in. —Yours, J. MTlveen.
Port Louis Merchants’ Gazette, of 12th
March, gives the following account of a hurricane
in the Mauritius, which blew a train over a bridge
and killed a score of people. One of the passengers
jumped out just in time. He writes :
I then looked about and beheld a scene I shall never
forget. One of the middle carriages went over the bridge,
taking down with it the other carriages, save the two
front ones and the half of another which had been broken
in two halves. Those carriages went slowly down, one
after the other. The outcry which then rose was some-
thing terrific. I was in a complete state of amazement
when I saw the carriage in which 1 was a minute before
going with the others down the abyss. I knelt and
thanked God.
This reminds one of the unctuous utterance of a
similar saint on a similar occasion; “My dear
friend Smith nearly upset the boat, but I had the
presence of mind to rap him on the knuckles, and
he sank; so I got home in time for dinner.”
Selfishness is the essence of all religions which
base morality on a system of supernatural rewards
and punishments. The believer who is going to
Heaven cares nothing for the millions of souls to
be tortured in the abyss. “ O Lord, let me get my
little soul in !”
Col. Maude’s new book, “ Memories of
the Mutiny,” is the sort of book to give a hungry
man the feeling that he wasn’t hungry. For
instance:—
The natives were shot down or strung up with as little
compunction as if they were dogs. At Cawnpore, he saw
“fourteen men who had just been hanged upon a single
branch of a large neetn tree. Several of us were looking
up at the victims, and noticing the signs of life that were
still visible in some of them. Suddenly, without any
warning, the neemwood being exceedingly soft and
brittle, the branch gave way and crashed down among
us with its ghastly burden. Sometimes the condemned
men were tied up to a stick fastened across the shafts of
a cart or a gig set on end.” Remonstrating with the
Provost-marshal on this cruel method of strangulation,
the Colonel received the following for reply:—“Well, I
don’t know, sir ; I ain’t heard any complaints !”
The oft-made and contradicted assertion about
blowing mutineers from guns brings out this
breezy little tale :
The saintly Havelock asked him if he knew how to blow
a man from a gun, and receiving a reply in the negative,
rejoined, “ Very well, 1 will send you a man this evening.
. . . The first man led out was a fine-looking Sepoy,
with good features, and a bold, resolute expression. He
begged that he might not be bound, but this could not be
allowed, and I had his wrists tied tightly, each to the
upper part of a wdieel of the gun. Then I depressed the
muzzle until it pointed to the pit of his stomach.” On the
cannon being fired and the smoke clearing away nothing-
was visible but two legs lying in front of the gun ; and
after the lapse of seven or eight seconds down fell his
head which had shot up into the air to the height of pro-
bably 200 feet. Presently the same results occurred in
the case of the second man blown from a gun at Have-
lock’s orders. “These,” writes Colonel Maude, “ w'ere
the only two occasions in which this truly fearful punish-
ment was inflicted by Havelock, although at Meerut,
Delhi, and other places there were many more.”
Henniker Heaton explains that he doesn t
want to be an Australian Rowland Hill, only an
English Rowland Hill. He merely clamours for
penny postage to, not from Australia. There can
be no Australian objection to that. So long as
all possible revenue loss falls on England—why,
cert’nly !
The circular to teachers which has been
carried by the religious party on the London
School Board, after a great struggle, enjoins the
use of the Bible as a text-book, and suggests the
elucidation of the principles of the Christian reli-
gion, “including a belief in God theEather as
our Creator, in God the Son as our Redeemer, and
in God the Holy Ghost as our Sanctifier.” As
this is pure dogmatism, and the teachers as a body
believe in it as little as any other educated men,
they oppose the circular strongly, but the clerical
party was too well represented on the Board.
Practically, however, it will be a dead letter,
since it is impossible to enforce it, and the debate
will probably lead to a change in the Board’s con-
stitution.
Dear Bulletin, —Re your correspondent,

tralian blacks, thus says “Rolf Boldrewood ” (not

M'Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
M'Burney, Wallis and Co. report:—This being the non-
auction week, we have only private sales as a guide to the
state of the market, and from these we gather that prices
are on a par with auctions held last week. From our
London agents we learn by cable that July series of
London sales opens on the 3rd, September series on the
18th, and November on the 22nd.
We do not look forward to any marked increase in
prices for the July or September series, but have better
hopes for November, if the extensive demand which will
then be taking place in Sydney does not check a London
increase. Last year the Sydney market was about even
with London, and the coining season, we venture to pre-
dict, will see our market well ahead.
On Thursday, the 31st inst., we will bring forward a
very representative catalogue and expect competition
quite up to late rates, or possibly a little better. No
appreciable increase in value should be looked for before
the arrival of the new clip.

“ A Sydney Worker ” —who doubtless toils in a
silk hat and expensive imported boots—writes to London
Spectator stating that strikes have caused 99 per cent,
of the present distress in Australia. Neither the writer
nor the stupid paper that publishes his lie has wit to
remember that Australia is not a manufacturing country
like Hingland with a dozen European countries ever
waiting for an opportunity to sneak a bit of its business.
A strike here means a temporary stoppage of production
followed by an extra flow of production which nearly
covers the lost time, and the after-effect of the trouble is
very slight, nor can there possibly be a long after-effect.
The Australian strikes (coal-strikes excepted) of recent
years have injured nobody, as it happened. People
didn’t really lose money thereby. A few tens of
thousands of pounds were prevented from getting into
the banks, where they would have been disposed of in
extra overdraft to men who would assuredly have
swallowed it in the form of foreign champagne. Uncon-
victed crime is what’s the matter with Australia just
now, and the disease threatens to become chronic.

Liquidator Ducket read aloud last week a list
of companies whose shares are “ held as security ” by the
Mercantile Bank for advances to the amount of nearly
£300,000. “No one in the room,” said Ducker, “would
now give £5 for the lot.” 48,000 shares in the Victorian
Deposit Bank were pawned with the obliging Mercantile
management; Intercolonial Land Company proprietors
disposed of 31,000 shares in the same way, and so forth.
10,000 chances in the delectable Balfour, Elliott and Co.
arrangements were “ swopped ” for Mercantile cash.
These facts are growing old now, and The Bulletin
desires to mention them with the respect due to age.

Dear Bulletin,—Forged Sydney tram-tickets!
Um ! the game has been going on for long. The genuine
tickets were so crudely printed that the department itself
could hardly tell the shams from the real. Lots of
outsiders knew all about it. I know one white printer
who had a golden offer years ago to work the thing.
He refused bravely, but he was only one printer after all,
and where one defeats the devil of temptation how many
are only too anxious to succumb ? And, now, it was not
an official or a detective but a mere shopkeeper who
“ narked ” the golden game.—N.P. N.B.—The “ white ”
printer is now in gaol—mainly, for other people’s
swindling. As Ned Kelly said, “ Such are life,”
• • * •
We are gravely informed that the N.S.W.
tramway tickets have a watermark, while those alleged to
he forged have not. The N.S.W. Government watermark
is by no means an absolute precaution, since it is put on
by the private paper firms which succeed in getting con-
tracts. In England, while there is no Government print-
ing-office, the work being done by a few private firms, all
Government paper, from the Bank of England notes to
the Revenue Officers’ rough survey-book, is manufac-
tured in Government mills, under lock and key and
Excise supervision.

Up South recently a “colonial-experience" man

Dear Bulletin,—“Tirai Piripi” contrasts the

hand, puts you to sleep with a homily, and then runs the
rule over you. I would rather be done by a Jew than a
Scot, for the former will often enough deal liberally with
you once the transaction is ended, but the latter—not

One aspect of the Abigail case has been over-
looked. A thousand Investors’ Reviews and howling
Wilsons could not have done one-tenth the injury to Aus-
tralian credit which was done by. the Abigails of Austra-
lian society. When the glorified little cobbler appeared
at functions and spoke on platforms from London to
Belfast, people wondered why so mean and illiterate a
creature could have attained the rank of Cabinet Minister.
The anomaly was put down to honesty, industry, and the
deference due to a self-made man in a new country. But
when the cable burst the honesty bubble, the English
public only remembered the cunning, ignorant schemer
who used his political position to inveigle them into his
cronk pawnshop.

The City of Melbourne Building Society’s scheme
for selling its otherwise unsaleable properties to its own
depositors is at last beginning to work. The deposit
receipts are taken at their face value, and as they will
only sell in the open market for 7s. 3d. in the £, the
depositor feels that he has done well; the society trades
off its desirable suburban villas at their face value, and
as it couldn’t get 7s. 3d. in the £ for them in the open
market, it is also satisfied. Also, the depositor saves rent
and gets a watertight roof over his head, and the society
saves interest on deposits, taxes, repairs, worry, com-
mission and other charges. It is a pity the process
can’t be extended indefinitely. If James Beef Patterson
wants to show his backbone for the very last time,
he might do worse than pass an Act whereby every busted
financial institution would be authorised to pay its
depositors, as far as it could, in property, said property
being valued by an independent authority at something
like present prices, and make up the deficiency after-
wards, as much as possible, in calls. It might be rough on
the average depositor to be paid in brick villas and the
like, hut he would get more that way than by the present
process, where half the villas go in the slow and costly
agony of liquidation.

People who know the present ruling Victorian
crowd intimately don’t feel especially sanguine about the
proposed State Bank. Even if it does get started, there
are many awkward possibilities about it. It may be used
to provide billets for a lot of fallen bankers who want
billets badly just now, and who would gladly give the
State the benefit of their experience for an adequate con-
sideration. It may come in handy to save sundry recon-
structed banks when the deposits fall due-a perfectly
legitimate proceeding if it makes advances to them on
adequate security, but a ghastly business if it makes ad-
vances on the good old Mercantile basis. If the old boora-
orowd gets hold of it, the State Bank will probably make
advances to any rotten bank without any security at all,
rather than run the risk of more “revelations.” Also,
there is a dismal possibility that the State Bank may
acquire a connection to start with by the simple process
of taking over a few of the cronk banks bodily. Nothing
is absolutely impossible in the present state of Melbourne
commercial morals.

Now that the totals are made up, 1893 has been
indeed a gay year with the “private enterprise ” railways
of the U.S.—the country of private enterprise par excel-
lence. During the 12 months 71 railroad companies
burst, representing in all 22,534 miles of line ; and over a
hundred million pounds of capital has gone hopelessly
bung, while liabilities, consisting mainly of £150,000,000
worth of bonds, will realise various sums in the dollar —
how much the average will be is extremely uncertain.
Other obligations, apart from bonds, represent probably
about £30,000,000 more, and will mostly realise very little
in the dollar. During the last ten years 306 U.S. railway
companies have gone bankrupt, with nearly £700,000,000
of liabilities and 67,400 miles of track for assets. This
result has been arrived at—despite enormous State sub-
sidies and all manner of Government assistance —mainly
through frantic competition and wholesale muddlement
and fraud. Altogether “ private enterprise" in railways
looks uglier and more unprofitable every time it is heard
from, and all the eloquence of W. E. Abbott can’t improve
its bony and forbidding aspect.

The English and Australian Mortgage Bank
(in liquidation, as a matter of course) presents one of
those_ hair-raising balance-sheets to which Melbourne is
growing so much accustomed. In a general way, its
liabilities to depositors, &c., are £850,000, and its assets,
including the calls which may come in, are about the
same. But to get at this result the assets, as the liquida-
tors candidly acknowledge, have been taken at their book
valuation—which is generally about four times the present
realisable value; so when the shareholders have been
squeezed to the uttermost, the prospects look very like
6s. or 6s. in the £.

An important point was decided by Q. Supreme
Court, last week, in the mining-case, Plant v. Rolleston.
Judge Harding held that a freehold grant from the Crown
does not carry gold and silver, and that anybody could
go and mine where these metals are. Griffith and

Editor Bulletin.—Sir, — A paragraph in “The
Wild Cat Column ’’ of your issue dated 26th inst. reflects
seriously on the financial position of the New Zealand
Insurance Co., but the statements, apparently founded on
figures recently circulated by some disappointed and
spiteful person with a desire to injure the company, will
possibly recoil upon his own head. No insurance co. from
its inception could have been more careful than the
N.Z.I. Co. has been in the interests of its shareholders.
When in the early days of its prosperity it could
have paid 50 per cent, dividends out of profits, its
directors wisely limited its dividends to 10 per cent,
and carried forward the balance of profit each year
to enable them to build up a substantial reserve. The
policy of the 00. has always been to move cautiously
and safely and dividends have been paid from
year to year, at all times, out of the year’s profits.
1 enclose a copy of the balance-sheet for ’93, from which
you will see that the profits last year were £53,804135. 6d.
to which was added the amount of balance, £17,898 16s.
lid. carried forward last year, making a total sum of
£71,703 10s. 5d., out of which a div. at the rate of 10 per
cent, with a bonus of 2J per cent, was paid, £lO,OOO
credited to investment fluctuation account, £lO,OOO in re-
duction of company’s freehold premises, £5OOO to city
leasehold sinking fund, and £19,203 10s. sd. was carried
forward to next year’s account. 1 think you will admit
that this is not a bad record for the co., especially when
you consider the times through which New Zealand and
the other provinces have passed. There ennnot be better
evidence of the stability of the co. than the fact that its
shares, which are paid up to £2, are saleable in
New Zealand at 58s.—a premium of nearly 50 per
cent. The New Zealand Insurance 00. is admitted
to be one of the most carefully-managed and stable
companies in Australasia. It is not of mushroom growth,
and its annual profits are larger than the capital and
the whole of the assets of many companies now doing
business, and its promptitude in paying claims is well-
known. The following are its figures, supplied to the
N.Z. Government last year under the Companies Act:—
Assets, £520,843 ss. 7d.; liabilities, £49,010 Is; being
£271,832 17s. 7d. in excess of the paid-up capital of
£200,000. The Co.’s investments are assessed at bed-rock
value, and were never in a more sound position than they
are now. It must, however, expect, as a matter of fact,
that on account of its success many hungry and disap-
pointed offices will adopt any means to gratify their spite
because of their inability to share therein, and will imi-
tate cowards and assassins, who crouch behind stone walls
so that, unseen, they may be enabled to carry out their
purpose. Knowing your readiness at all times to act
justly, I forward this letter for insertion, to remove any
unfavourable impression that may have been made
through the publication of the article referred to.—Yours
faithfully, S. Hague Smith, Manager New Zealand Insur-
ance Company for New South Wales. [The Bulletin
didn’t get its information from any rival office. Also,
The Bulletin’s only said that the oo.’s reserve was
reported to be invested in shares carrying a vast con-
tingent liability in calls.—Ed. B.]

The Mount Huxley boom is, no doubt, most
exciting to the people interested, but to outsiders it is
only amusing. Nearly everybody concerned belongs to
the ancient race of Israel, and while the average Hebrew
knows too much to dabble in gold-mining after the
manner of the ordinary Gentile, yet, when he does let
himself go, he is a most enthusiastic and even reckless
speculator. In view of recent market developments there
can be no doubt that the Mount Huxley promoters
solemnly believe every word of the poetical literature
which has been appearing in the disinterested press.
Some of the papers have actually devoted leader-type to
ravishing descriptions of this Yandemonian Golconda.
As for the average mining investor, he shrugs
his shoulders and waits. There were millions in Taran-
ganba, there were also millions in Last Call. There were
also millions in a historical N.S.W. mine, the outward
and visible sign of which, so far as Sydney is oonoerned,
was a pickle-bottle-full of golden stuff—on the strength
whereof the Chosen went simply wild. They were wilder
still when they left off.
Mount Huxley may be good, bad, or indifferent,
but it has been absurdly over-boomed. Tas. Govt.
Geologist has inspected Mount Huxley, and expresses
himself cautiously to the effect that if there is gold it will
pay, and if there isn’t any gold it won’t. Promoter
Samuels’ eloquent statement that “Mount Morgan is
only a backyard to it ” is pardonable as coming from a
gentleman whose line hitherto has been musical instru-
ments, not mines, and who is evidently still very strong
on “ the flute.” Nor does anybody attach any importance
whatsoever to the “expert” opinions of more or less
amateur artists, and so on. The name of Dr. Helms, the
well-known chemist and assayer, has been freely men-
tioned in connection with the mine, in which he is under-
stood to be a big shareholder; but, then, the accomplished
and honest doctor is not a miner, and doesn’t profess to
be; moreover, he has so far said nothing publicly about
the matter.
The Bulletin recommends the Mount Huxley
people, if they want to put their fate to the test, to ask
the Queensland Govt, to let Mr. Jack inspect their mine.
If Mr. J. says Mount Huxley probably contains £140,000,000
worth of gold—an addition, say, of one-ninth to the world’s
present stock of gold, coined and uncoined, the mining
public will put its shirt on the gamble.
Mr. Beardsley, manager of Kennedy and Son’s
smelting works, who examined the property in the inter-
ests of a Melbourne capitalist, says that Mount Huxley is
a good speculation, a “big, poor thing,” not of fabulous
richness; but which, if worked on good, economical lines,
would pay. There must be no waste, and it would not
pay to give £lO,OOO away in purchase-money. He con-
sidered that there would be abundance of water ten
months out of the year, and the lay of the country made
it possible that the King River might be diverted. He
thought the country very similar to Treadwell Island,
Alaska, where the stuff is taken out of an open-face
quarry, at a value of 12s. per ton, keeping 380 stampers
going. Mr. Samuels talks of thousands of stampers, and
is bent on getting out £lOO,OOO worth of gold before
Xmas. He is reported as afraid lest the mine’s colossal
output should depreciate the price of gold. The Bul-
letin sincerely hopes it will.
• * * *
The following are a few hunks from Mr.
Samuel’s speech at Hobart—as reported by the Mercury :
“When the mine was in full swing that statement would
be verified, for he firmly believed that the output of gold
from it would be so tremendous as probably to lower the
standard of the value of the mineral. ... At the foot
of the mountain there was a mass of a sedimentary
pyrites formation, which had been roughly computed to
measure six chains either way, with a depth of not less
than 30ft., and all of which was gold-bearing, although
with the mass of stuff in the mountain itself, it would not
require to be worked for generations to come. (Laughter.)
The assay of the pyrites formation gave the enormous re-
turns of 148 oz. gold per ton of concentrated pyrites, 83oz.
free and 115 oz. chlorinated gold. From measurements
furnished by a mining surveyor there were 9,000,000 cubic
yards of stuff in 60 acres of the mountain, and allowing
that each cubic yard equalled 2 tons weight of stone with
an average yield of sdwt., the result would be £20,000,000.
(Laughter.) Personally, he (Mr. Samuel) was convinced
that the five blocks contained £150,000,000 worth of gold,
and that the discovery on Mount Huxley would, in the
course of five to ten years, depreciate the value of gold.
(Laughter.) He brought down two dishes of rubble
from the mine on his saddle, and took them over
to Sydney to get a fair assay. In the first sample
they got 7dwt. 3gr. of free gold out of what was washed,
and the average was loz. 15dwt. per ton for the dish.
The other dish went loz. 17dwt. per ton. This was from
one side, and the other side was richer. Dividends would
be paid before they could turn round. (Laughter). As
to the prospects of the mine, when he placed it before his
friends they rushed him. The difficulty was not to get
money, but to keep it away and keep fellows out.
(Renewed laughter). The shares on the other side were
£250 each. There were but 10 for Tasmania, but they
would be divided into 100 at £25 each, and he could
assure them, as a sane man, that in 1896, when they had
got to work fully and strongly, every £25 share in this
mine would be worth from £7OO to £BOO a year to the
holder. (Laughter.) He gave them the pledge of a man
of reputation that they would have £lOO,OOO of gold out
of the mine before Christmas. He was returning to
Sydney, and 60 head of stampers would be on the mine as
soon as they could be got there. He would not stop till
they had 1000 or 2000 head of stampers on Mount Huxley.
And that would not make a hole in the mountain. . . .
Talk about Mount Morgan for a million, why it was only a
backyard to this place.” (Loud Laughter.)

Mount Lyell half-yearly meeting in Melb. to-
day (31st). For six months ended March 31, the shoot of
silver-bearing copper ore first met in the south drive of
No. 4 tunnel yielded 284,3280 z. silver and nearly 56 tons
copper, averaging 13030 z. silver and 25.62 per cent, copper
to the ton of stuff. This has raised the balance to credit
of profit and loss to £36,314. It is proposed to issue
£150,000 debentures to build a railway to the mine, and
the Tas. Parliament is expected to guarantee them.

In a village north of Townsville lived two bank
managers, a Customs officer, and C.C. (the Chinkie
Chiseller). 0.0.’s balance at bank No. 2 was £400; his
overdraft at bank No. 1, £lOO, with bond warrants on a
large number of opium packages lodged as security. On
several occasions C.C. took cases of opium from bond, but
each time brought two or three back, saying either that
the opium wanted age or that the hieroglyphics betokened
that something was the matter with it. Presently the
bank’s account with C.C. showed an overdraft of £3OO
against 18 bond warrants. Then C.C. withdrew his
balance from bank No. 2 and vamoosed the ranche. The
18 oases turned out to be filled with stones, though the
Customs seals were intact. Anybody who wants to die
has only to whisper “ Opium 1” to the manager of bank
No. L

Remarks made at the recent trial of the so-
called Mount Morgan gold robbers, in conjunction with
the Charters Towers case of Plant v. Rolleston at present
proceeding, have struck certain magnates of the Mount
Morgan Gold Mining Co. with deadly terror. In the
Charters Towers case, just mentioned, it is argued on
behalf of plaintiff, that by ancient English law all gold or
gold-bearing quartz in a grant of freehold is vested not in
the grantee but in the Crown. The Mount Morgan Gold
Mining Co., in fearful anticipation of evil to come, is
consequently applying for three leases of 25 acres each on
the site of its present freehold, making a total of 149
acres under leasehold. This leasing (in case of an adverse
decision) will, of course, prevent jumping and legalise
future working, and, also, by a piece of legislative
legerdemain, sanctify the exploitation of the freehold in
the past.

Bayley’s, whose shares have steadied a great
deal, are now running 10-head of stamps, the stone
treated by which “ comes almost exclusively from a heap
of seconds accumulated at grass when only very rich
stuff was being treated by the Panklast.” “ Almost
exclusively ” is good. “The output the first week in-
creased to 600 oz.” (and last week it was 7500 z.). How
much, if any, rich stuff is being added to keep up or
raise the average ? Ten head of stamps should crush
120 tons or so of stone; if so, then Bayley’s seconds
give 6oz. per ton. Wanted—the official interpretation of
“ almost exclusively."

Broken Hill South has closed down and applied
for labour suspension. When the much - advertised
sulphide concentrating plant was started several months
ago, it was announced that the salvation of the mine had
come. Afterwards it appeared that, although the plant
was doing everything that had been claimed for it, there
was one drawback —no market could be found for the
product; and, finally, after a few months’ run, it was
closed down while the directors commenced a hunt round
Europe for a market. Meanwhile, it was promised that
the suspension was temporary, and that exploratory work
would be continued. Now the closing of the mine finishes
the game. Shares once sold at over £B.

OKTLY ADDRBSS.
The Slay of the hadji.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The “ Salaamat Jalan ” —the Bon Voyage—had
not on this occasion justified her appellation. The
nor’-easter had been at high jinks ; instead of
pushing the doddering old trader steadily over
her accustomed thousand miles of ocean between
the Aru Islands and Macassar, he had half-a-
dozen times essayed to push her under instead.
The rapid dowsing of her huge mat sails had saved
her then, but, now that they were hoisted to their
highest, the monsoon had played his rarest prank
and refused to blow at all. So here, upon the
eighth day out, the lofty peak of Bonthain, instead
of towering imminent upon the starboard beam,
showed but a shadowy speck above the cobalt sea-
line far ahead.
“ How far ?” asked Cardigan. He was a trader
from the Arus, and was in a hurry. But the
Javani skipper wasn’t. Taking the mountain’s
height as a basis, he deliberately applied a thou-
sand-year-old Chinese formula. Then he answered
in Malay, “Of your miles, about one hundred and
ten.”
The other turned away—stared up at the blind-
ing sky, away over the oily sea. “ Too long !” he
muttered. “ Two days’sail yet, with this infernal
old ramshackle —even if there was a breeze!”
He walked to the little palm-thatched deck-
house, went in, shut the sliding-door behind him,
and lifted from its place a section of the split-
bamboo floor. Between this and the deck was
a 15-inch space—scant lying-room enough for the
man that the trader now looked down upon, with
a puzzled horror on his hard, brown face. The
other, pallid and gasping, looked up with wildly-
staring eyes, and from his mouth came husky
ghosts of words.- The trader, reading the grey
lips, repeated in a whisper the almost soundless
question.'
“Howlong! No longer! Not another hour in
this he broke off, took a brandy-bottle from
a tambox slung to the roof-ridge, and put it to the
other’s mouth.
The man took a gulp that humanised again his
ghoulish eyes; then Cardigan helped him from his
lair and laid him on the sleeping-mat—the ghost
of a straw-haired youth of twenty-two, with a
fluff of coming beard about a mouth mean and cruel.
To an observer, that is; but “ Hard-case-Oar-
digan ” was no observer. He was the typical wild
whiteman of the Archipelago; more generosity
than honesty, and more courage than either!—and
he had, as such strong-hearted fellows will, fallen
in love with this fish-blooded creature that lay on
its back and feebly reviled him.
“My intentions was the best, Tom!” the big
fellow said in a rueful whisper. “Pulled through,
all right, we would, too, only this cursed calm
comes an’ blocks us ! Who the devil’d expect the
monsoon to go slack in July ?”
The other, with the bottle in his hand and some
of the brandy in his voice, snarled like a cornered
cat, “What I want to know——Cardigan
dropped swiftly to his knees, stopped the words
with one brown paw, and pointed with the other
to the bulkhead.
“For your life, you fool!” he hissed into the
young fellow’s ear, “ the skipper may come in
there any minute! Don’t let’s bo dead-’uns sooner
than there’s any help for !”
Then he got up and listened. The captain’s
voice came faintly between the slappings of the
prahu’s “overhang” upon the water, as she
wa liowed on the lazy swell. Out of ear-shot yet !
The trader stooped again and whispered rapidly.
“ S . tafce of th f Cfe j 8 .just this, young man :
iwo hours more n that hole d finish you ! That s
one certainty. Then, if you’re found, you’ll be
krissed, an’me’long with you. ’Nother certainty!
So, quiet as a wooden mouse is your only chance —
an’ a thin one at that!” More gently, then, as
the other’s terror made him let the bottle roll
away; “I’ll save you, Tom, if man can doit!
An’, any case, we won’t go under for nothin’!” He
tapped the revolver-case under his linen jacket.
“ But there’s 40 krisses against us, if there’s one;
an’ the old man’s a reg’lar tiger-cat 1”
And) that very momen t, the “ old man ’’-who,
by bbe way, was a young one—was heard in his
den on the^fcher sid / of th * bu i khead . He wanted
the white m he oalled t and oardigan went .
Jusal handed him a box of cl ’ ieroots> an( f mo tioned
him to sit. “ Serious!” the trader told himself,
and seriouB he found ib for whab the skipper of
the <* S alaamat Ja i a n ” asked him, without pre-
ambl6) waa> if he had heard of the killing of the
bo ly hadji who had been striving to make true
be ii evera G f the accursed heathen of the Arus ?
„ ~ . . T , 11T . . . ‘ ,
Quoth Captain Jasal: 44 It was in my mind to
have sooner talked with thee of the matter, but
v °y a £ e 'hathi been of much peril my thoughts
w ®y^ lse ,^^ e ’ , , , ,
, , ~e , s ’ Cardigan had heard. A dreadful
“ eec * •
iruly a dreadful deed . The little yellow
Pmxed fiercely. And by a countryman of
thine, —and Jusal peered through the smoke at
the so-called white man till the mahogany coun-
tenance grew a shade nearer its nominal colour,
But its owner wasn t called a hard case for
nothing. He stared full into the blinking black
®Y es > answering as bluntly as Malay would let
„ __
kay not _so, Kapala! He was but anjing
pumpak —a piratical dog—whom no country would
own ! And the hadji had spat in his face ! It is
not safe to spit in a white ’
° 8 cynical grin admonished him of .a false
move.
“Just now thou saidst he was no whiteman !
Bat white, or brown, or black where is he .
Men said at the islands that in some Macassar
hapal-— such as this, let us say the murderer
would escape.
Down Cardigans spine went a creeping as or
ants, his e Y es never flinched from the skipper s
narrowed now to fire-beaded slits. #
Believe it not, Kapala /—-the man is dead .
_ White man, thou best .-—he is there / and
J^ Ppmted to the bulkhead. #
Cardigan s back the ant-procession ceased.
A twitching he had felt before came into pistol-
arm and trigger- finger, and, without moving
head, he noted that of the two he was the nearer
oor ; _
“ J heard thee say ‘Too long! ‘Too long for
what? I asked myself, and followed thee. Thou
didst not hear Jusal glanced at his slippered
but I heard . Also, I saw . He stooped
against the bulkhead, pointed to a tiny hole—
then started round and found the door blocked,
Kris and pistol leaped out together, and for ten
seconds the men were statues. No rush, Jusal
knew, was as quick as a bullet, and call out he
dared not, for he saw in this man’s deadly eye
that his first cry would also be his last.
44 Gouch i ” the white man softljr oalled.
V Round here with you, quick; an bring ’long
that ooil of line overhead I Like lightnm’, now I
an’ nobody’ll see you I ” ,
With a desperate gulp of what remained in.the
bottle Gouoh whipped down the coir-line, darted
from door to door, glanced at the kris, and backed
hastily into the corner.
“ Down with that pig-sticker, now, my little
man ! ” Cardigan said.
English this was, but the skipper understood.
Sulkily he threw down the weapon, and Cardigan
kicked it across the cabin.
“ Now, Tom Gouoh,” he said, “lash this little
spitfire up as tight as a boiler-plate, ’n’ be quick
about it, too! ”
Gouoh made an artistic job of it; then mounted
guard with the pistol while Cardigan took “ a
squint round outside.” Instantly the Javani got
to business. He had sized-up Gouoh and saw a
chance.
“White man,” he said swiftly and eagerly,
“ ye cannot escape! Me ye may kill, but there-
after will the crew kill ye both. Thee —the slayer
of the hadji—they will roast alive ! Understand
thou Malay ? ”
Gouoh was a Penang man, and understood so
well that the pistol nearly fell from his shaking
fingers. “What is it ?” he stammered. “What
seekest thou of me ? ”
“ This! ” and the little man wriggled fiercely in
his bonds. “ Me thou hast not injured, save only
at that black-bearded dog’s bidding. On him
would I be revenged ! Unbind me—and I will
preserve thy life. By the Stone of the Caaba I
swear it! ”
With terror-sharpened judgment Gouoh weighed
the chances —for himself. Of Cardigan’s thousand
kindnesses —his freely ventured life—he never
thought at all. It simply wasn’t in the creature !
In half a minute he decided, put the pistol down,
and was searching for a knife to cut the cords,
when far away across the sweltering ocean arose
the noise of a million wheels upon a mighty bridge.
“Angin besar!” shouted the little captain.
“ A squall! Quick, fool —quick! ”
But then, with night-like darkness and a roar
that smothered out all other sound, the wind was
upon them, and the deck —hove quickly up on
Gouch’s side—flung him heavily to leeward on the
top of Jusal. For nearly a minute the angle was
too great to let him scramble up to starboard,
where the door was. The prahu was fairly beam-
ended, and Jusal commended his soul to Allah.
But then she slowly righted. Gouoh crept out
and was instantly wind-nailed against the house-
side. Hither presently came Cardigan, crawling,
brought out the kris and the forgotten revolver,
and pressed the pistol into Gouoh’s hand. “Do
your best with it!” he shrieked in the other’s ear,
“ an’ I’ll make shift with this !”
But now the sea had got its head up. A dozen
snowy surges flogged them where they stood, then
bodily inboard came a huge “green sea” that
swept the bamboo structure overboard like paper.
Into a tangle of coir-cordage and bamboo spars
the three men rose again. The Javani, hand-and-
foot-bound, came up like a log, went down again
like a stone, me trader, active as a montcey, was
on board in two seconds, looked back, saw Gouoh
between the mainyard and the side, and plunged
in again. The ninety-foot bamboo spar, light
enough in itself, yet took from its enormous length
a powerful inward “ send,” and Cardigan, bracing
his back against the side, fended off the yard with
horizontal legs.
“Now’syour time,Tom I” he panted. “Scramble
up, quick !”
Gouoh did more than scramble—he sprang from
the other’s rigid legs ! The jerk broke Cardigan’s
outward “ thrust” —the spar came resistlessly in—
and in a moment the “hard case” was soft enough!
* • •
Through Salayer Strait at sunset stood the
“Salaamat Jalan,” jury-rigged—an easy matter
in craft that are not much more at any tiine. The
monsoon had settled down again to steady work,
and the white-haired old juragan— captain now—
was investigating.
Said he to Gouoh —“And where, then, wast
thou before the squall ? Till then had no man of
us seen thy face.”
“ Thy captain had. With him in his house did
I live. He kept me close, so that the other white
man might not know, because against him was I
to bear witness at Macassar !”
“He who was crushed ? What, then, was he ?”
“He was the slayer of the Hadji!”

Crushing of the splendid Q. sugar-crop
will begin early this month, and the planters’
organ again emphasises the probable scarcity of
white labour. This is in order to drag the
wretched unemployed up to flood the market and
reduce wages. Whatever white labour seeks em-
ployment in the mongrel-ridden province should
be prepared to organise and stand out for decent
wages, which the industry can well afford to pay.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
V. •'(
■
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.
Skins on Fire

Randwick, March 12, 1894.
[REPLY.]
TO THE 400 ELECTORS OF RAND-
WICK, who signed the Requisition to me
to become a Candidate for that Electorate.
Gentlemen, —
I have to thank you most sincerely for youi
Requisition, and for your strong expression of
confidence in me, but I regret to say that I can-
not at present become a candidate for Parlia-
mentary honors. As I take a strong interest in
public affairs, I hope in the near future to be in
a position to place my services at your dis-
posal.
Yours faithfully,
H. OXENHAM,
Normanhurst,
Randwick, May 15, 1894.
“ Some years ago, in Victoria, a ‘ bride
when asked at the altar whether she would have
the man for her husband, replied ‘Nc,’ ‘Well,
what have you come here for ? ’ demanded the
disgusted clergyman. ‘To tell him so,’said the
artless girl.”—Sydney D.T.
Dear Bulletin, —Be your extract from
an interview with Mr. Guy Booth by, it must
not be supposed that “the intrepid Australian
Explorer ” took in anybody but a green reporter
and his equally credulous sub-editor. TheR.G.S.
of London distinctly declined to notice that
gentleman’s alleged exploratory work. I would
undertake to say that any average reporter or so-
called interviewer in Sydney, Melbourne, or any
other of the capitals, could be filled to the brim
with skilfully-told lies about Australia. —D.
P.S.-—Mr. G.B. travelled from Queensland to
Victoria overland.
Minister Suttor, of N.S.W,, firmly believes
that every boy should be taught boxing and should
become an expert with his fists. Yet, according to
a Melb. paper, Mr. Suttor only engaged in one
fight in his life, and then he got the worst
of it, not through lack of pluck, but
because of his hopeless want of science. An-
other N.S.W. politician, however, has an even
worse record. He also only engaged in one scrap
in his life. It arose out of a quarrel in a bush
shanty, and the future politician found himself
rushed into the difficulty unawares. His sup-
porters assured him that, after the language used
by the other party, he must fight, and, despite his
frantic remonstrances, they assisted him off with
most of his clothes and planted him opposite his
half-naked antagonist in a paddock. Then there
was a hurried biting and kicking match and a
cloud of dust arose, out of which the future mem-
ber presently emerged with a scared expression of
countenance, and ran for his life. He took refuge
behind a heap of stones, and when his opponent
ran after him he let fly sundry rocks and
knocked him out. The crowd protested and called
bad names, but the politician threw gibbers
at all and sundry, and being a dead shot presently
routed the whole assemblage. Then he put on his
clothes and went home, and became a rich and
respected citizen.
Dear Bulletin, —Here is a story told me
by a man of culture and refinement and, I believe,
veracity : —“Some time ago I bought, in N.S.W.,
an estate on account of the fine orangery. When
I took it over the trees were in beautiful condi-
tion, but recently they were attacked by soma
disease which was rapidly killing them. Not
knowing exactly what to do, I wrote to the
Department of Agriculture to send up an expert
to examine and advise. Soon afterwards I was
sitting on my verandah, enjoying a smoke, when
up drove, in a sulky, a gentleman I had known in
another country. ‘ Hullo !’ I said, ‘ what brings
you into these parts ? ’ ‘Oh ! I’rn an Inspector of
Agriculture. I’ve come to examine those orange-
trees of yours.’ Wondering what the deuce he
knew about orange-trees and their diseases I in-
vited him inside, while the groom took away the
horse and sulky. We dined and talked over
affairs generally, but not a word about orange-
trees. lEe his billet, I said, ‘I suppose his Nibs
is sticking to you?’ ‘Not he. John Gregory is
my chief backer. You see, my wife has a good
connection that is professionally useful to him, so
the benefit is mutual.’ We continued talking and
sipping whisky till afternoon, when he thought he
would ‘ get.’ So bis trap was brought and I saw
him to the gate of the property, when he suddenly
exclaimed, ‘Ah ! by-the-by, I forgot to look at
those orange-trees of yours ; but I tell you what,
you send me a note of what you consider wrong
with the trees, and I’ll forward a report based
upon that to headquarters.’ ‘I can hardly do
that,’l remarked, ‘since I do not know what is
wrong with them.’ ‘ Well, I’ll fix it up, ’ and with
an au revoir he drove off.f [Sometime after this I
received a letter from ‘ headquarters ’ notifying
me that the expert had reported that the trees
were dying through the roots reaching brackish
water. In reply, I stated that the expert must
have been labouring under some misapprehension
as, firstly, the trees were on a hill 60ft. above any
water; secondly, the younger trees were dying
first, and I thought the oldest trees, having the
longest roots, should be the first affected ; and,
thirdly, that the nearest brackish water was a
quarter of a mile away. Then I got a letter
stating that the Department agreed with the
inspector’s opinion. Then I gave the N.S.W.
Agricultural Department best. ” —Fact.

'RUPTURE CURED
-FOR FIFTY SHILLINGS!
Hilgaro, Oregon, Judo 28,1893.
Dr. Pierce & Son.—Gentlemen: I am happy to in-
form you that the Truss I bought of you last April has
cured me of a very severe case of Hernia,
f from which I have suffered for over 18 years. I was
f rather sceptical about your Truss when I bought it, as I
'hadtried several so-called Elastic Trusses withoutderiv-
fing any benefit from them; but after using your Truss for
a short time I was convinced that it was the best lever
f h ad, as i t was easy to wear, and seemed to stop the severe
pains that often prostrated me while wearing the old i
Spring trusses; and now, in spite of my scepticism, I am r
Perfectly Cured, and can work with the Truss off if! r
feel so disposed, but I still wear it loosely as it is not j
inconvenient. You may add the above to your otherl
testimonials. Gratefully yours, FRED. HANSEN,
above cure was effected in less than three i
months time, at a total cost to the patient of £2.9.5. [

With water or seltzer nor even alone }
To change one’s liquor is deadly sin,
A sin that it takes long days to atone :
When the coat of my stomach is worn through
and done,
And bones are brittle and flesh is sere,
1 Remember, friends, if you’re not all gone,
Get me a glass of colonial beer.
0 rich, warm, sparkling liquor, wherein
Fire, air and water are all in one—
With a trifle of mud that it be not too thin,
And a twang of the faintest, to give it a tone
I fear you have made me a sorry drone;
And absence of work gives now no fear,
I want no vittles and work for none :
Get me a glass of colonial beer.
1 care not aught for your English kin,
Nor eke for porter in bottles of stone;
Your fervour oozes itself from my skin,
And has worked its way deep into the bone.
I have tangled my feet while my light has shone,
Shall I tangle them still in that region drear,
Where drinks are seldom and life is lone ?
Get me a glass of colonial beer.

When I get to heaven I’ll Jay me prone
On my face and pray for this thing most dear,
Pray like to the Lord on his throne
To get me a glass of colonial beer.

however, is founded on piety—which is a rock.

Every day, about one o’clock, a well-dressed

round until he gets a chance to seize an empty
pewter-pot off the counter. Then he retires with
the pot to the lunch-table, and eats with cam
persistence for 15 minutes, taking long drinks of
nothing in between times. When he has finished
eating he takes one more satisfying drink out of
his blank pot, wipes his mouth, puts the vessel—
still full of the same old emptiness—on the
counter, and departs full of good food and con-
tentment.
Washington (U.S.) has just had a “spicy ”
trial, involving a well-known social magnate,
Colonel Breckinridge, and a 15-year-old girl named
Pollard. The Woman’s Purity League, of Boston,
adopted a series of resolutions concerning the case,
in which they say : “ This cowardly, silver-haired
monstrosity, old enough to be her grandfather,
deliberately decoys, entraps, and betrays a poor
school-girl.” In closing, the resolutions say :
“ We extend to Madeline Pollard our sympathies.
There are few women to-day who have not done
indiscreet things in their school-girl days.” Which
last sentence (remarks S.F. Argonaut) must
make the husbands of the Purity Leaguers quite
pensive. The court was crowded with sightseers,
mostly women, whose unseemly and morbid curio-
sity so disgusted Judge Bradley that he rebuked
them sternly : “The spectators here have been on
trial for their decency, and they have been proved
guilty of indecent conduct. These people who
come here day after day are like buzzards waiting
for a pile of carrion.”
Dear Bulletin, — Lie first introduction of
Kanakas. In the summer of ’G7-’t>B Messrs.
M‘Lean and Beit, of Westbrook Station, Darling
Downs, obtained from one of Bobby Towns’
island traders a couple of boys, Caraffo and
Johnny. The idea was to break them into shep-
herding, but they were found wanting all along
the line. The M‘Lean in question was Colonial
Treasurer at the time of his death through falling
from his horse while riding with a loose rein. By
the same token the old school of squatters were
mostly ignorant and careless with regard to
horses. Beit, M‘Lean’s partner, capsized a buggy
in which he and his first wife were proceeding
to the station, and she was killed. Said
Beit was a choleric, but just man. The
violent temper was hereditary, teste the his-
torical shindy at “Newlands,” Parramatta River,
when the father of Beit and Governor Sir Charles
Fitzroy exchanged shots over a game of whist.
His Ex. let fly a decanter at the head of his host,
who retaliated with a silver candlestick. Beit, pere,
was a nominally-Christianised German Hebrew,
who first struck Australia’s shores with a cargo of
dolls’ eyes and monkeys on sticks. His descend-
«»ts are now still powerful in the land. —Wurby

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I.
Nature had evidently destined Mr. Mason for
the ministry. A small suburban Methodist church
was clearly written in the book of Fate as his
future. He was thin, frail-looking, scantily-
bearded, and the definition of a straight line
exactly described his mind. Naturally, hemarried
an anajmio girl who was equally suited to the cir-
cumstances. She had a great opinion of the
dignity of her position as a minister’s wife, and as
this belief did nobody any harm she was never
undeceived, and the two formed a little mutual-
ad miration-society into which a big-headed baby
was presently admitted.
In common with the rest of his cloth, Mr.
Mason looked upon the preparation of his weekly
sermons as a work entailing a severe mental
strain. When he was engaged in the arduous
task of stringing weary old platitudes together in
the room he called his study, his admiring wife
crept about with hushed footsteps, and enquired
anxiously after his health when he emerged pale
and wearied. It was whilst he was thus busy at
flattening-out the devil that there came a vigorous
peal at the bell, which made Mrs. Mason rush in
alarm to the door lest the noisy summons should
be repeated. A burly, boarded man stood there,
apparently possessing the Masons’ missing share
of vitality. He was well-dressed, but for all that
did not look quite like a “ gentleman.”
“I wish to see the Reverend Mr. Mason,” he
said in a loud and hearty voice.
“ Is your visit important ?” enquired Mrs
Mason, “ because Mr. Mason is just now preparing
his sermon, and I do not like to disturb him.”
“ I am leaving town to-day, so cannot come
back again,” returned the visitor. “I have a
message from his cousin.”
“ From his cousin ?”
“Yes, I have just come from Queensland and
am going on to Melbourne to-night.”
Mrs. Mason asked the stranger to enter and
went and called her husband.
“ You have a cousin called James Parker ?” said
the man when the parson came in.
“I have relations of that name, but lam not
personally acquainted with them.”
“That’s quite right. Jim said you did not
know each other. He heard you were here and
asked me to call and tell you that he would be
down himself shortly.”
The little clergyman murmured something about
the pleasure he would feel at meeting his relative.
His visitor hesitated and glanced so meaningly at
Mrs. Mason that that innocent-minded matron
blushed and felt quite uncomfortable.
“ It is rather a delicate business,” he com-
menced after a pause, “ but Jim was desirous I
should make matters plain before he came. The
truth is that he is desirous of stopping with you
during his visit. He is well-off,” he continued
hastily, seeing a change pass over the countenance
of both man and wife, “ and is willing to pay
handsomely for his accommodation; but the
trouble is this —Jim boozes a good deal.”
“ Boozes ? ”
“ Yes, drinks. Gets the horrors. I’ve nursed
him myself through two or three attacks. Jim
has always got some fad or other, and he thought
if he could stay with you a bit it might do him
good. Help to cure him of his weakness for
drink. If you think you can manage it I wish
you would let me know.”
The parson and his wife reflected. A cousin
with money who wanted to be converted ! “ I
think we can oblige him,’ said Mr. Mason at last;
“ in fact, it is our clear duty to do so.”
Jim’s friend seemed relieved. “Now, I’ll just
give you the run of the ropes,” he said in a more
easy and colloquial manner.
“ Is Mr, Parker married ? ” interrupted Mrs,
Mason.
“ Well, not exactly. He’s had his little
entanglements, but I don’t think he ever quite
got married.” Mrs. Mason got very red and
wished she had not spoken, and their visitor pro-
ceeded.
“ Jim is sure to break out once or twice before
he gives it up, and I’ll tell you just how to work
him. When Jim starts he always loses his legs,”
“Loses his legs?” repeated Mr. Mason as
though he thought the limbs in question were
detachable.
“ Yes ; there’s where you have the pull on him.
Put him to bed, and he’ll stop there so long as
you keep him supplied with liquor—if not, he’ll
crawl out on his hands and knees after it. When
the fit is going off he’ll begin to talk. First of all
he’ll begin heaving things at you.”
“But,” expostulated Mason, “I thought you
said he would be quiet.”
“ I don’t mean hard things, boots or brushes, or
anything; but he got religious once, and he’ll
think you’re a sinner, and want to heave texts and
sermons and lectures at yeu, especially
drink, then he’ll backslide.”
Mrs. Mason started.
“ Commence driving bullocks—he was bull
punching for four years. You never heard a man
driving bullocks ? Well, Jim could do it properly,
so you’ll have a treat. Then he’ll start swearing at
Kanakas. He was plantation-boss once. Kanakas
take a lot of swearing-at, and Jim was an artist at
it. Next he’ll make love. That’s always the end
of it. He goes the same round every time ’’—check-
ing them off on his fingers—“religion, bullock-
driving, nigger-driving and love-making. But
he’s a good-hearted fellow, and you’ll like him.”
The stranger rose. “I’ll wire Jim that you’re
agreeable, and you may expect him at any time.”
“I did not quite catch your name? ” said the
clergyman, interrogatively; but the man from
Queensland only bowed and departed, without
satisfying their curiosity.
11.
Mr. and Mrs. Mason held many a consultation
over their expected guest, and, once over the first
shock, began to look at the matter as a special
favour of Providence. He set to work to pre-
pare earnest discourses on the sin of intemperance,
and she got ready the spare-room, and hung appro-
priate texts around the walls.
In due course the unknown cousin arrived. He
was younger than his friend whom, however, he
somewhat resembled both in appearance and voice.
He was to all outward seeming clothed and in his
right mind, and poor little Mrs. Mason gradually
calmed down her excited nerves as she noticed
nothing unusual in his manner. His financial
arrangements with Mr. Mason were eminently
satisfactory, and the worthy couple felt that they
had struck a streak of good luck. Acting on the
hint conveyed , by Jim’s friend, the Masons,
although a most abstemious couple, had got in a
small supply of wine and a bottle or so of whisky.
But Parker resolutely declined it and even looked
stern disapproval when the clergyman himself
indulged in a very small glass, by way of
hospitality. One evening, much to the amaze-
ment of husband and wife, he completely took the
wind out of the parson’s sails by reading him a
lecture on the evils of moderate drinking.
“Don’t, my dear fellow,” he concluded impres-
sively ; “look at the bad example you set others.”
The good couple sat in affrighted silence. “ It’s
coming,” was their common thought, “ He must
have been drinking outside.” They glanced
anxiously at their cousin’s legs, which, however,
showed no weakness at present.
When Mr. Parker went to his room that night
he found a bottle of whisky left ostentatiously on
his dressing-table. Next morning the empty
bottle was found lying in the garden, and Mr.
Parker left the house after breakfast in a very bad
temper.
Late that night the clergyman, who had retired
to rest, heard him let himself in with his latch-
key. He rose and looked out to make sure that
everything was right, and by the light of the
candle left in the hall, tor the visitor’s benefit, saw
a singular sight. His cousin was evidently in a
cheerful humour, so cheerful that he could not for
an instant cease laughing. He was very unsteady,
but managed to get to his room, chuckling all the
time ; and the uneasy little parson heard unholy
merriment proceeding from his chamber at inter-
vals all night.
In the morning, Mason cautiously peeped into
the room. The whisky bottle had been emptied,
and his cousin was asleep, breathing heavily. His
face was flushed, he was only half-undressed, and
looked such a different individual from the sober,
serious, proper inmate he had been accustomed to,
that he scarcely knew him. He left some more
liquor in the room, and crept noiselessly out.
That was an awful day. Parker drove bullocks
all the morning in a stentorian voice, which re-
sounded through the small weatherboard house
like blasphemous thunder. Mrs. Mason and the
maid had to go about with wool in their ears.
Visitors who called, serious people, were greeted
with profane objurgations directed against
“Smiler,” “ Rattler ’’ and “Boxer,” also against
Brandy, Strawberry and Sherry. In the after-
noon he cursed Kanakas in several heathen
languages, but unfortunately mostly in English.
He was still in full blast when a dark-com-
plexioned lady of masculine figure came to the
door and enquired for Mr. Parker. Mrs, Mason
told the enquirer that Mr. Parker was too unwell
to see anybody. At that moment a volley of
abuse came floating down the stairs. The lady
seemed to recognise the voice, for she smiled
“ It’s all right,” she said ; “ you see, he gave me
this address, and it seemed so queer his stopning
here that I called to make sure he wasn’t coming
the double over me. He owes me a bit of money”
However, it’s all right. I’ll call again.” And she
“Good gracious!” thought poor Mrs. Mason
as an idea struck her. “ That must be one of
entanglements.”
That evening an elderly old maid came to see
Mrs. Mason. Fortunately, the patient was quiet
and the two ladies were enjoying a little scandal
when the servant opened the front-door, there was
a step in the passage, and in came Mr. Parker
Poor Mrs. Mason’s nerve gave way completely
“ Henry ! Henry 1” she screamed, “ He’s come to
make love to us.”
At these awful words the old maid went into
shrieking hysterics, and the wretched clergyman
rushed in distractedly from his study.
There stood Mr. Parker sober and collected
“I presume this is some trick of that wretched
brother of mine?” he said severely.
Mason looked at him and the truth dawned on
him as a burst of insane merriment came from
overhead. “Is that your brother upstairs?’’he
asked.
“ I expect so; did you think it was me ?”
“ I could not help it. You see, his face was all
flushed and queer-looking, and he is very much
like you.”
“ Now, what has he been up to?”
Mason recounted the particulars of the first
visit.
“Of course. That’s his idea of a joke. He
simply described himself instead of me. I cer-
tainly asked him to make arrangements with you
for my stopping here, and he wrote that he had
done so but that I must keep an eye upon you as
you were addicted to the vice of secret drinking.”
Mr. Mason groaned. “Now I am a rigid teeto-
taller, and was much annoyed to find you put a
bottle of whisky in my room the other night
which I promptly emptied out of the window, f
saw my brother in town yesterday morning and
could see that he had been drinking, and lectured
him severely. He did nothing but laugh, and
I suppose managed to steal the latch-key out of
the pocket of my overcoat. I had to go up the
line on business yesterday and was detained all
night.
Although the bad language overheard in the par-
son’s house created some talk, the thing soon blew
over, and the couple had no cause to regret know-
ing their new relatives. But the old maid has
never forgiven Mrs. Mason to this day.
