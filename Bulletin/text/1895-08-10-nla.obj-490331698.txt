A NEW BOOK.
“The Gods, Some Mortals, and Lord Wicken-
ham,” by John Oliver Hobbes (cloth, 6s. 6d.),
oompanions the author’s previously-collected
works in size and price (Some Emotions and a
Moral; The Sinner’s Comedy; A Study in
Temptations ; A Bundle of Life ; with portrait—
cloth, 6s. 6d.). The uniformity might have ex-
tended to binding also, in spite of the change of
publishers.
Mrs. Craigie’s new book has keen pathos, for it
is the book of an unhappy woman. One did not
need the confirmation of her divorce to diagnose
a bruised heart behind the brilliancy. Such pearls
are for her sex, alas ! an abnormal secretion —they
mean a life-current turned awry. No wonder
Mrs. Craigie’s epigrams dazzle ; they are written
with her biood.
The mood of most of the previous stories was
that of satire sown with sobs; now the sobs are
stifled, and the satire is sadder for their suppres-
sion. The author’s perception and philosophy
seem deeper, calmer; the phrase-making is hardly
so clever as before, but the stream flows more
strongly beneath the rarer bubbles of bright foam.
Does the story reflect Mrs. Oraigie’s own life ?
Was she the one who lost all to marry a wanton
at the instigation of impetuous Sex ?
The talent and most of the interest of the book
are in the first two-thirds; the remainder adds a
comparatively dull inevitable.
The old Faust-contest—far older than Faust
contest—between flesh and spirit is again shadowed
in Simon Warre, a medical specialist who has
spent the sap of his youth in study which brought
fame and wealth, but not happiness. At 27, he
already felt that need for the society of a com-
plaisaiUe woman which Yoltaire attributes to nearly
*n men past leur premiere jeuncsse. There is a
strife between higher and lower nature, cerebrum
and cerebellum, divine love and human lust. He
yearns to Allegra, a shy, slender child, who
“ seemed to have been whipped up into a fragile
existence from the very cream of tenderness,
weakness, love, and folly.” He marries, hating
himself, Anne, a superb animal, whom her lover’s
death shocks into wedding-day recital of a sordid,
Jitiable past. Warre’s character has a weak
;rain; there is no separation; gradually he drains
his cup to the dregs. There is an ineffectual
meeting with Allegra; Anne flees with a rich
admiper; Warre dies of heart-break. Allegra
gives her ashes' to Lord Wiekenham, Warre’s
friend, whose occasional appearance in the back-
ground supplies justification for his name’s inclu-
sion in the book’s fantastic title.
The feature of the book is the character of Anne,
whom it would be curious aud profitable to com-
pare and contrast with Beatrix aud Madame
Bovary. She is a strongly-drawn type of the sen-
sual Eve; Allegra a more weakly-suggested por-
trait of the spiritual. The author rightly insists
on their feminine identity. “ Allegra was an
innocent Anne; Anne was a vicious Allegra.”
In strenuous passage after passage Anne is por-
trayed as only woman—or genius—can portray
woman. Wane is not nearly so well done: his
attitudes and actions are always unconvincing.
The rest is brilliant sketching only; and the book
as a whole, in spite of its extreme cleverness, is
episodal and temporary.
Incidentally the author seems to say how little
men know women. Here is Allegra’s affection
concealed under a mask of stiffness, and Warre
does not guess, or is never sure. But would most
men of intellect, imen of experience, not see the
truth in the circumstances ?
Apparently Mrs. Craigie still clings to religion:
it is only when she is given a good man that
woman can dispense with the good God. How often
feminine derelicts seek from a priest the consola-
tion which they have failed to find in a husband !
Some good things:
“He was a dear, but dull; good-looking in a
way, but too much lake a stone Roman in a photo-
graph of ruins.”
“Why is there ho Eden for some Eves ? Why
is it that only God is good enough and the devil
is bad enough to be safe in their company ? ”
“ All women are unladylike when they get in a
temper; they remember all the naughty things
men have told thorn.”
“She is a good little woman with a rather
at tractive squint. And so kind to the poor. ”
“ Have you ever seen him on a horse i He looks
like the last match left in a tray—the one which
won’t burn.”
“You see, it was hopeless from the beginning;
so he told me he loved me, and I told him I loved
him, and we kissed each other good-bye. That
was all that happened. It is a very short story to
tell, but it’s my whole life, Anne. All the rest is
merely time time just hours, weeks, and
months.” . .
“ You want a bourgeois devotion expressed in
the spirit of Dante.” [A characteristio male
want V] . .
“ Hers was an inquisitiveness, too, which was
as far removed from sympathy as old straw is from
new-mown hay. If a friend broke his leg she
would ask him in how many places, and whether
he groaned.” .
“ Sir Hugh Delaware was a baronet in reduced
circumstances who, in the early part of his career,
had spent his small fortune in riotous excess,
driven fast horses, and been driven by a fast lady.
This person, whom he could never be induced to
abuse, was known as his ‘ Ruin; ’ and Lady
Delaware, whom he had never been heard to
praise, was called his ‘Salvation.’”
“ She owned that she was not at all clever, and
did not understand social questions. She only
wished that spotted veils would go out of fashion.
They hurt her eyes.”
A suggestion of Anne :
“ As Anne drove away, she thought how com-
fortable Warre’s house was, how agreeable it would
be to live there, and how much she loved him. She
did not consider him handsome ; his good looks
were of a type which she did not understand. She
liked something more conventional —more effec-
tive, in fact. But he was very nice, and what
lovely Persian carpets ! What fine pictures on the
staircases 1 He surely made a lot of money—and
he was no doubt generous. The servant looked
contented. Oh, Simon was charming! She lewd
him dearly. She hoped the drawing-room was
large. All the interesting people in London would
come and see them. She would have a grand
wedding, for, of • course, he meant to marry her.
He had told her to break off with the other'brute.
And the other was a brute. She hated him. But
he bad given her some beautiful presents. Would
she be obliged to send them book ? ”
This pinning-down of specimens is of course
brutally unfair to the author, whose book should
be bought and read twice through. But is not
the last bit worthy of Thackeray ?
PUBLICATIONS.
“ Peter Steele, the Cricketer,” by H. 6. Hut-
chinson (Macmillan’s Colonial Library; paper,
2s. IDd.; cloth, 3s. lOd.) is an unpretentious
romance of love and cricket from which Australian
willow-patrons should extract a great deal of
pleasure.
Three really good Australian publications are
Cole’s “Fun Doctor” and the first and second
series of Cole’s “Thousand Best Poems” (each —
paper, 25.; cloth, 35.) The first is about the best
collection of humorous matter extant at the price;
and the. others bring together in handy form a
very wide choice of popular verses, classical pieces
being intermingled with many of those stirring bits
of sentiment which go straight to the heart and
stick there.
“Light as the Interpretation of the Law of
Gravity,” by A. M. Cameron (Angus and Robert-
son), is mere midwinter madness.
“ The Time Machine,” by H. G. Wells (paper,
Is. 9d.) is a very clever and interesting tale of
humanity’s future —one of the best fancies of the
kind ever composed.
In “The Australian at Home,” by Edward King-
lake (cloth, 35.), are collected the sanest criticisms
of Australian life anywhere to be met. The
book has not, of course, the fascination and
literary strength of Francis Adams’ “ Austra-
lians,” but it is sensible, proportioned, and true.
Most of the im. Aer is certainly famdiar, not to say
stale ; but this objection does not apply in the case
of the English reader —who gets these “useful
hints ” among others offered “to those intending
to settle in Australia ” :
“ti. As you won’t want to shoot anybody
(except perhaps yourself), you needn’t buy a
revolver. Many other articles will realise more at
the pawnshop.
“15. If you are a ‘bad lot,’ and the dear old
folks at home want to get rid of you by packing
you off to the other side of the world, add to your
iniquities by refusing to come. Australia doesn’t
want you.”
Two new volumes in the “ Social Science Series”
(cloth, 3s. each) are “ Work and Wages,” by
Thorold Rogers, being a reprint of the most im-
portant chapters from the professor’s larger work ;
and Rousseau’s famous “ Social Contract,” with a
lengthy and valuable introduction. Social students
will eagerly welcome these —two of the best books
in a good and cheap series.
“The Humor of America” (paper, 3s. ; cloth,
45.) is the best volume of the “ Library of Humor”
series. The writers are not cramped in trans-
lations, but sport freely on their native heath.
The selections are good, new, and modern ; there
are many illustrations; and a biographical index
is attached. Decidedly a book to buy.
“The Sexes Compared, etc.” (cloth, 35.), is a
translation of several essays by von Hartmann,
the German philosopher who has perhaps more
kinship with Schopenhauer than with any other
predecessor or contemporary. Hartmann w read-
able and suggestive ; and the argument of the first
essay is worth consideration by the New Woman.
The feature of the handsome Illustrated
London News Summer Number (Is. 3d.) is a new
story,“ Toxin,” by Uuida.
Lovers of Gordon wdl welcome the graphic
illustrations of himself and his poems issued by
the Somerset Publishing Co. Under the title of
“ Reminiscences and Unpublished Poems ” (cloth,
Bs. (id.) are given “ Argemone” (recently published
in The Bulletin), some characteristic “Verses to
my Old Black Pipe,’’and an equally characteristic
letter. Three clever drawings illustrate Gordon’s
grave, the leap over the fence at Mt. Gambler, and
Gordon reciting in camp. The last is specially
good, and all are well-reproduced on plate paper
12ui. x The same publishers issue six illus-
trations of Gordon’s poem “From the Wreck,”
suitable for framing, on mounts 20in. x lOin.
(10s. (id. the set). The artist, who prefers to be
anonymous, has produced some uncommonly strik-
ing pictures, full of energy and truth, and well
worth a place on Australian walls.
“ The Speed Secret, a short cut to rapid work
in Shorthand and Typewriting” (9d.) should be
bought by every typist and shorthander.
Anyone who has not made the acquaintance of
that pleasant woman poet, Jean Ingelow, can do
so with satisfaction in the admirable selection of
her “Lyrical and Other Poems” (cloth, 35.) just
published.
NOTES.
The sale of “ Pickwick Papers ” is now close on
700,000.
Herbert Spencer recently declined a German
knighthood, on the ground that rational philo-
sophy and titles don’t chime. Yet London
Chronicle, the leading democratic daily, remarks,
with apparent depreciation, that Higinbotham
was “ nothing more ” than plain Mr. to the end.
An American literary critic says Nordau’s
mare’s-nests lie thick as leaves in Lombroso.
Max Pemberton, the clever writer of Jules
Vernish romances, before writing “The Sea
Wolves ” made a careful study of the modes of
transporting gold from England to Russia, and in
his story worked out a scheme by which an
immense amount of bullion was stolen in course of
transit from the tugs to the steamers. Lend.
Spectator says that certain firms of English
financiers noted the story, and held enquiry to see
whether the scheme was feasible. They found it
was, and as a result the methods of transport have
been changed entirely, and the use of tugs has
been discontinued.
Though his name still appears as editoi-, Jerome
is said to have sold for .£20,000 his paper, To-Dav,
which signalised itself by offering an advertising
silver medal to a young Australian who saved his
brother from a shark. Under Jerome, To-Day has
been generally readable and invariably snobbish.
It started with some good illustrations and original
articles, but latterly the illustrations have grown
scarce and the editorial scissors have risen every
morning at 5.30. Jerome will now presumably
devote himself exclusively to the creation of
“new humor.” He is a pushing young man, and,
if he were not so bumptious, would be amusing.
As it is, he is exceedingly amusing.
A London publisher, Andrew Tuer, tells the
Athrn.'EUM of “another terror.” “In the open-
ing page to some typed sample chapters sent over
here by a colonial authoress for English publishers
to taste is the following refreshingly audacious
foot-note :— ‘ Where inverted commas have been
omitted, I desire to thank those authors whose
works I have quoted.’ ” Name, please !
Mrs. paffyn has written a short tale for “ The
Zeit-Geist Library,” entitled “ A Comedy in
Spasms. ”
NOTE.—As most of the books men-
tioned are in strong demand, some may
be temporarily out of stock. In such
case, orders will be filed, and the books
forwarded immediately on arrival of next
shipment.

COUGHS. GOLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
Srove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
iev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir,—Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in faet, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMBS,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir,- —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“ Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H, WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

O XT R S E L V B S !
We wish It to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when w'e
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants tvho study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

est skin cures, blood purifiers, and humor

[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Here I sit in fruitless fretting,
Anxious surmise, painful guess.
With a brain that fast is getting
Rank with fostered idleness ;
In a useless, aimless fashion
Let my thoughts arise and die,
Hopeless of a true expression,
Heedless how the minutes fly.
What is Life, our vaunted portion ?
Unfulfilment, doubt, despair !
Why waste all our days in caution
Lest we miss our little share ?
Will, that lacks performing power,
Strength, we know not how to use ;
This is all our glorious dower,
This, the soul we would not lose !
Ah, we feel our impulse leaping
At the suffering and the wrong,
At the moaning and the weeping
Of the weak beneath the strong.
Reel a strength to strike and vanquish
Rising passionate within,
Strength to cure the bitter anguish,
Triumph o’er the arts of sin.
Why do we for ever falter,
Ever fear to strike our best ?
Why with our emotions palter
Till they sink in deadened rest?
Eor, in vain an outlet seeking,
Soon the spark has lost its heat,
While the sorrow still lies shrieking
Round our long-delaying feet?
Is it best to keep the middle
Path, that gives us comfort cold ?
Care no more to loose the riddle,
Take the gilt, and call it gold ?
Ever doomed to failure dreary
Oftentimes we fall and cry ;
And our souls, of labor weary,
Pray for nothing but to die.
All is empty, useless, hollow—
Eor we know our hopeless clay ;
For we know we dare not follow
Where we point the upward way.
Honor, nobleness, perfection—
Are but words we learn by rote;
Were they spoken with reflection,
They would choke the lying throat.
Through the shrouds that close our vision
Comes no ray of any star,
Comes no voice to tell our mission,
Whence we come, and what we are.
All our poetry and story
Cannot light the vaulted gloom ;
Even Christ’s unmeasured glory
Shines above an empty tomb.

THE EARTH IS THE LORD’S.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the front of the Royal Exchange, London, is “The
earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness, thereof.”
‘‘The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof
They have carved it in letters of stone
On the mart where the modern pirate stand,
Plotting to seize in his soft, white hands
The harvest the poor have sown.
“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof,”
And the poor are the Lord’s great care ;
But His priests’ great care is the pirate’s soul.
For their prayers are bought with the heavy toll
That is wrung from the toilers’ share.
“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof
Yet His people that delve therein <
Are the muzzled oxen, faint with blows,
Who, starving, tread out the corn for those
That neither toil nor spin.
“The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof,”
And gold shares shall spring from the sword ;
So the bishop blesses the Maxim gun,
For his shares will rise when its work is done,
And the blacks are reaped for the Lord.
The earth is John Bull’s and the fullness thereof;
And wherever his brood may range
They carry his message with shot and shell—
The black man’s land for the white man’s hell 1
For that is a Royal Exchange.

EXISTENCE: A DEFINITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis a strange disease where we laugh and weep
And are lulled at times in the arms of sleep ;
’Tis a passing flash, ’tis a waking dream,
’Tis a wave that lifts on an endless stream ;
’Tis a mystic trance where the things we see
Are the shadows faint of the things that be ;
’Tis a goblet that’s mingled of joy and of fear,
Tis a pendulum swung ’twixt a smile and a tear;
Tis a battle for bread and for love and for breath,
’Tis a race for life to the jaws of death 1

done.” Later on, the same individual stated:
“ We gave to the Catholics the same right as we
wish for ourselves—freedom of conscience.”

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo ” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“tHZS.EE CASTLES” and “ CAPSTAU.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co.. Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and ‘‘Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people-
should or should not smoke.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1895.
Queensland Finance.
The great problem of Constitutional Govern-
ment in Britain is to find materials for one
efficient Ministry out of nearly 40,000,000
people, and the exceedingly bad results
which are occasionally arrived at show that,
even out of 40,000,000 people, it is often
difficult to find half-a-dozen really able states-
men. The problem in Australasia is how to
find materials for seven efficient Ministries
out of 4,000,000 people, which, on an arith-
metical basis, is just about 70 times as
difficult a question. Therefore, as a natural
consequence, Ministries in this country are
mostly feeble and inefficient, and not any
more honest than might reasonably be ex-
pected. And as the Treasurer’s position is
the one which presents most difficulties and
demands most intelligence, and as even
Great Britain is only able to find, out of her
40,000,000 people, a commanding financial
genius once in a long while or thereabouts,
and as Australia is still less able to find seven
commanding financial geniuses out of one-
tenth the population, it comes to pass
that the average Treasurer in this country
is generally a great and dismal failure.
Under these circumstances, the fact that
Hugh Nelson is Premier and Treasurer of
Queensland is, perhaps, a shade less astonish-
ing than it seems, though the presence of
Nelson at the head of a Government is an
astonishing fact under any circumstances.
• • •
Queensland, for a number of years past,
has possessed the most crooked Government,
and the most bankrupt Treasury, and the
most dishonest financial policy in Australia.
Under the party system the business of
every Treasurer, like that of every other
Minister, is to do his best, not for the
country but for his party —to spend money
lavishly in order to retain his supporters ;
to keep the taxes down to the lowest possible
point; and, with all this, to make the finances
look as if they were straight, whether they
are or not. Therejs absolutely no reason,
so far as the party is concerned, why they
should be straight ; it is only necessary that
they should seem as if they were. Conse-
quently, almost every Treasurer is politically
dishonest, partly because almost everybody is
dishonest, and partly by I’eaSon of his special
inducements to dishonesty. The Queensland
financiers of late year’s, however, have had
more inducements to- gp crooked than the
majority of their species. The political
party now in power practically owns the
Queensland National Bank, and the Q.N.
Bank owns it, more or less, in return ; in
fact, the personnel of the Government party
and that of the bank are so largely identical
that it is often difficult to tell them apart.
The Q.N. Bank is supported by the Govern-
ment to such a liberal extent that not very
much less than one-half its deposits are State
money —much of it, seemingly, borrowed for
the bank’s purposes ; and it is sufficiently
obvious that the sudden withdrawal of these
deposits, at this distressful period, would
shake that institution very violently indeed.
If the Government goes out, that event
implies the advent to power of a party which
has no direct interest in supporting the Q. N.
Bank, and which might do something to it
which would bring woeful disaster on its
shareholder's—who are largely the party now
supporting the Nelson Ministry. Therefore
the ruling crowd of the Assembly has more
reason to keep itself in power by any process,
no matter how desperate, than has any
other Ministerial following in Australasia.
Whether any of its doings actually arise from
this motive is a mere matter of conjecture,
but the motive, at all events, exists.
« » •
This state of things does not conduce to
good Government, and the Ministerial
policy in Queensland, from whatever
cause, has been, for many years past,
even more reckless than that of Victoria
at the boom-time. Queensland has now
a debt of £74 per head, nearly twice
that of Victoria, and the heaviest debt, in
proportion to population, on this earth.
Much of it was incurred in order to build
railways across empty wastes, in order that
the land in the vicinity might be rendered
saleable, so that the proceeds might be
dumped into the Treasury, to save it from
bankruptcy. Queensland has now more rail-
way, in proportion to population, than any
other country in the world, Westralia alone
excepted. The interest on its public debt is
£2 18s. Id. per annum for each inhabitant—
the biggest interest bill in all this globe of
debt and bankruptcy. It has habitually
raised a larger proportion of its revenue by
land-sales than any other province, New
South Wales alone excepted ; and it has
had, for many years, the largest average
expenditure per head, again with the excep-
tion of New South Wales. Also, it is the
only province of Australasia where the
colored labor question has grown to dangerous
dimensions, the only province where the
working-classes are kept down in the Fat-
man interest by a Coercion Act, and
where employers and employes are periodi-
cally in a state that borders on civil
war, and where two-thirds of the pro-
vince is retained against its will by the
Parliamentary majority of the other third.
Queensland, with its debts and difficul-
ties, its Kanaka and Chinese question,
its Separation Question, its annual dis-
turbances in the West, its suppression
of the Opposition voice in the Legislature
by the brute violence -of the Government
majority, its truly remarkable bank which
owns the Government party and is also
owned by it, and its equally remarkable
judicial system which also seems to be owned
by the Government majority, has almost
given up professing to be a self-governing
country run on Parliamentary principles.
* # *
Queensland, as Treasurer Nelson candidly
remarked in his recent financial statement,
has not had a surplus for many years past.
Also, it has not had an honest surplus, or
one which could bear investigation, for many
years longer. Queensland’s surpluses were
made, in the first place, by charging
ordinary current expenditure to loan-
moneys, and thus £10,000,000 has been
spent in various ways which yield no
revenue whatever —sunk in the bottom-
less gulf of wild-cat finance. A lot
more were produced by the simple
process of selling land at almost any price
to whoever would buy. M‘llwraith con-
stantly squared his finances in this fashion ;
he even conceived the stupendous idea of
selling practically all the remaining public
lands of the province in one lot to a British
railway syndicate, but the scheme somehow
fell through. But at last a time came when
land sales declined, not for want of land, but
because every bank and syndicate and
private speculator in Queensland was gorged
with this kind of property and required time
to unload. Then Queensland began to
accumulate a series of deficits which speedily
mounted up to something over £1,400,000.
These were staved off for the time being by
the issue of Treasury bills, and it was
decided to liquidate the bills by a new series
of land sales, the price being reduced to 10s.
per acre in order to induce local and foreign
capitalists to make a special effort and
swallow still more territory. But at this price
the special land sales only realised between
£400,000 and £500,000. Then the M‘ll-
wraijh - Griffith - Nelson Ministry made
the greatest financial effort of its life. This
special fund was authorised solely because
there was a huge deficiency to be liquidated,
yet not one penny of it went for that pur-
pose. It was all absorbed into current
revenue, so that the Ministry actually made
over £400,000 of new revenue out of its pre-
vious shortages. Then it floated a new loan
with a 60 years’ currency, for the purpose of
paying off the aforesaid Treasury bills,, and
£1,128,000 of the deficit is thus being
passed on to posterity as usual. ’ The balance
will doubtless be similarly dealt with later
on. The loan, by the way, was floated fully
’nine months before it was wanted, and the
province is paying interest on it in the mean-
time to the extent of over £31,000, which
represents another large sum gone into the
abyss of Kanakaland finance.
* # *
In addition to this £1,400,000 shortage
which is in process of being passed on to
posterity, Queensland has another floating
deficiency of £296,000 or thereabouts, which
further complicates the situation. Treasurer
Nelson announced the other day that the
province had, for the first time in many
years, a surplus of £104,000, and that the
floating deficiency was thus reduced to
£192,000. He also announced that the sur-
plus was to be formed into the nucleus
of a sinking-fund to pay off the public
debt, or at least the Treasury bills already
mentioned. It likewise appears from his
somewhat confused statements that there
are outstanding liabilities of the past year to
the amount of, perhaps, £150,000. There-
fore, Mr. • Nelson’s surplus apparently
stands somewhat as follows: —(1) There
is no real surplus, the £104,0b0 being
not nearly sufficient to cover the out-
standing liabilities of the year ; (2) If there
was a surplus, it could not be appropriated
to a sinking-fund according to any sane
financial process, as the Treasury has a
floating deficiency of £296,000 to meet ; (3)
If there was a surplus, which there isn’t, the
Treasury also owes £400,000 which it took
out of the special land sales account, and
which it is morally, thdugh not legally,
bound to repay ; (4) Treasurer Nelson pro-
fesses, by means of his surplus, to have
reduced the floating debt from £296,000 to
about £192,000. He is also going to vest
the surplus in the hands of “ independent
trustees ” as the nucleus of a sinking-fund,
and as the alleged amount, even if it existed,
can’t be in two places at once, it is obviously
impossible that he can do both these things
with it. To put the matter shortly, the sur-
plus of £104,000, if there is one, has been
arrived at by borrowing £1,128,000 and
putting it into revenue ; it has also been
arrived at in part by continuing to annex as
revenue the proceeds of special land-sales
which were originally instituted for a very
different purpose, and the rest by borrowing
a large sum from a wholly unaccountable
“trust account”; and, despite these two
different ways of bringing it about there is
no reliable surplus, and it is all, and more
than all, owing if there was one, and Trea-
surer Nelson’s proposal to do two separate
and distinct things with the money which is
already owing in four different places is an
absurdity in any case.
• * •
The ghastly humor of Nelson’s finance is
that it professes to represent the beginning
of a new and brighter era. The Treasurer
acknowledges that his predecessors have not
done all that they should have done in the
past, but he points with pride to the fact
that in future the financial administration of
the country is to be honest and economical
and capable of bearing the closest inspection.
The glaring and childishly clumsy process by
which his budget is juggled into an appear-
ance of partial solvency is interesting, as the
beginning of this financial reformation. What
Nelson’s finance would be like if he hajtnlt
reformed, and was merely going on in the
old, bad way, passes all speculation. The
only thing that can be said in his favor is
that his devices fire not quite so foolish, or
his figures so ridiculous, or his present
deficit quite so vast, as those of his con-
temporary, G. H. Reid, of New South
Wales. And that is but feeble commenda-
tion at the best.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Even-handed Justice.
Whether or no the Rev. Jas. Clarke has
been shabbily diddled out of his legal rights is,
of course, a question about which nobody very
much cares. The Rev. Jas. Clarke is the
Sydney cleric who objected to his wife wearing
stays on the ground that the Mother of the
Saviour never wore stays; and he Js also
alleged to have rolled his lady, in a nude state,
round a considerable extent of paddock strewn
with pebbles and jam-tins, in order that her
flesh might be subjected to his spirit in a suffi-
ciently orthodox degree. There is no doubt
that Mr. Clarke is most eccentric, and little
that Mrs. C. and her mamma knew something
of his eccentricity before the marriage,
but—if you want to be a vicar’s wife you
must make allowances. Anyway, Mrs. Clarke
had no difficulty in convincing Judge Win-
deyer that she had been grossly ill-used,
and a decree nisi in divorce was granted
in February, and made absolute on May 27.
Previous to this, and after his wife left
him, Mr. Clarke had been once confined
in a mad - house and once in a lunacy
reception-house—without preliminary medical
examination, and simply at the whim of the
police. Qualified doctors found nothing in his
condition to justify detention, and he was
released. His second arrest was a quite un-
necessary outrage, and Mr. Clarke asserts
(no doubt incorrectly) that it only oc-
curred because he quoted Luke xviii.,
6, after the divorce verdict had been
given—“ Hear what the unjust judge saith !”
When Mr. Clarke came out of the reception-
house, he proceeded to appeal to the Full
Court against Judge Windeyer’s rule abso-
lute—as was his undoubted right. His legal
position was this : if able to give security
for costs he had to ascertain what security
would be satisfactory to the Judge or Registrar
of the Supreme Court, and provide it within 21
days. If unable to give security for costs, ho
could sue as a pauper. It was his duty to
make affidavit that he was a pauper, and to
\pply to the Registrar for a certificate to that
effect within 21 days. Mr. Clarke, as an
undoubted pauper, complied with the latter con-
ditions. He applied to the Registrar for a certi-
ficate, which it is apparently quite within that
officer’s power to grant if he chooses, as soon as
he is satisfied of the truth of the affidavit.* Tho
Registrar does not appear to have questioned
the truth of the affidavit, yet he did not grant
the certificate, but told Mr. Clarke to go to
a Judge.. By this time Mr. Clarke must
have realised what an objectionable litigant he
was—if he did not realise it before. He went
to the Chief Justice, who has undoubtedly
power to order the Registrar to grant the cer-
tificate, and the Chief Justice told him to go to
the Full Court. He went to the Full. Court
and found sitting there Judge Windeyer, who
told him to come again when the.. Full Court
was differently constituted, Air this time,
of course, the 21 days of grace were grow-
ing beautifully less ; and before the Full
Court was differently constituted they ex-
pired altogether. And still the wretched
parson, tossed from pillar to post, had not got
his official certificate of poverty—neither, of
course, had he given security for costs. Be it
remembered that Mr. Clarke was not yet
appealing : he was only applying for per-
mission to appeal permission to use his
legal right to be heard in his own cause.
The Registrar so far listened to his plea for
justice that he set the appeal down for heal ing ;
and on July 31 this burlesque of justice was
enacted : Mr. Clarke, too poor to employ a
solicitor, appears in person, and details the cir-
cumstances recited above. Mrs. Clarke’s
counsel objects. No security has been given
for costs ; there is no certificate of poverty ;
the appeal ought never to have been set down.
Mr. Clarke pathetically explains. Judge
Owen says that he should have applied for his
certificate of poverty. Mr. Clarke explains
some more. Judge Simpson asks him can he
not give security for costs. Mr. Clarke con-
tinues to explain. The Chief Justice sums up.
He says Mr. Clarke has not given security for
costs, and he has not presented his certificate
of poverty. Therefore, Mr. Clarke is out of
court. He can’t sue as a pauper now, because
he has no certificate ; and he can’t apply for his
certificate, because the 21 days of grace have
lapsed. Therefore there is actually no appeal
before the court. Therefore the appeal is dis-
missed with costs. And if Mr. Clarre doesn’t
pay the costs of this appeal which never
existed, he can presumably be sent to gaol in
the ordinary course. The Bulletin is proud
of the N.S.W. Supreme Court.
In the Interests of the public and the reputation of th 9
profession, the view with which the court regarded a
solicitor’s delinquencies had to be considered. It would
be a lamentable thing if any idea of indifference to those
interests were to prevail witli the public, or that it should
be supposed that the court acted on a low view of the
moral and legal obligations of the practitioners as to
whom it might be called upon to exercise its jurisdiction
—Judge a'Beckett in Melb. Supreme Court.
One Law for the Rich, Another for the
Poor, and a Third for Lawyers.
Melbourne’s latest legal scandal— t.e., latest
at time of writing—was the case of one
Roberts, a solicitor, charged before Justice
a’Beckett with the particular form of mis-
appropriation which, when practised by mem-
bers of the protected profession, is known as
“ unbecoming conduct.” A succinct account
of this gentleman’s little indiscretion may be
quoted from the learned Judge’s summing-up :
With reference to the charges brought against Mr.
Roberts, lie would deal with that which was the more
serious first, and that was a charge perfectly plain and
free from any sort of complication as to what he might be
accused of doing. It was that being a co-trustee with two
other men, and acting as solicitor for the trust, he was
given £46!) for investment and had not invested it. In
answer to enquiries by one of the trustees he said: “It is
all right. It is in good security.” But, eventually,
when no further excuses were available, he con-
fessed that it had not been invested. Then, under
pressure, he gave them security for the money. It
was also clear -that the money ha ded to him for
investment was p]dd into his own account, that he
was engaged in la/ge speculations, and that he had the
advantages of tl/at money during the years when it
If people felt disposed to think
That Judges purse their lips,
And wink a sympathetic wink
At lawyers’ moral slips :
If folks saw slightest cause to snort
At what they hear and read
Concerning “ sharks ” before the court,
It would be sad indeed,
... -Indeed—
Yes, very sad indeed.
Their Honors don impressive wigs
And sit in judgment stern
On burglars bold, or common prigs,
With lofty unconcern ;
And did they draw distinctions broad
In favor of the breed
To which themselves belong, 0 Lord 1
That would be sad indeed,
Indeed—
Yes, very sad indeed.
Suppose it were an ancient fact,
And not a fiction new,
That learned Judges always “ act
Upon a lower view ”
Of lawyers’ sins when clearly proved
By clients whom they bleed—
Why, then our spirit would he moved
To whisper, “ Sad, indeed,
Indeed—
Yes, very sad, indeed.”
’Tis truly comforting to know
That such is not the case.
No lawyers view from standpoints low
A brother in disgrace ;
And should a member of the clan
Annex a client’s “greed,”
His Honor blames the gentleman
In accents sad indeed,
Indeed—
Yes, very sad indeed.


should have been safely Invested. Mr. Bobbrts’ answer
was simply this! “1 handed lb to my clerk for Invest-
ment. I believed it to have been invested, and I could
not tell until I came to search for the security that it had
not been invested.” That was the sole explanation
which Mr. Roberts gave, and he did nob say what
account was opened as to that money, or how it was that
from time to time Interest was paid on the money. If
there was no investment, there should have been no
interest There was no siKfKestion that the books were
not properly kept. Aj) to how the money was dealt with
was left an absolute blank.
Justice A’Beckett, it will be observed, couldn’t
get away from the fact that solicitor Roberts
had converted a client’s trust money to his own
uses, and told the thinnest of lies in defence of
his dishonesty, but because the man (was a
solicitor, and not an unprotected variety of
trustee?) his Honor seemed to think it necessary
to drop the truth gently. It is not thus that
Judges (outside of Melbourne) speak of ordin-
ary people who gamble with 'Coin entrusted to
them for safe keeping. Justice a’Beckett,
having gingerly suggested time Roberts’ ‘‘ ex-
planation ” was so “bald and insufficient” as
to be obvious nonsense, proceeded to shed a
beautiful soft legal light on the situation,
“There was the view that Mr. Roberts
deliberately left the money to take its chance.
He was engaged in large transactions” [so is
the clerk who plunges on the Cup race with
money * borrowed ’ from his confiding em-
ployer], “ and as he was a wealthy man
he probably thought no harm would come
of it through dealing with it in this manner.”
Justice a’Beckett found some excuse for the
gentleman’s crooked dealing in his conscious-
ness of wealth , although the land-boom exploded
before he took possession of the <£469, and his
schedule was filed before he admitted that the
money had gone into his private account. The
co-trustees have been compelled to make good
the .£469 to the estate. It would puzzle the
learned Judge to find an excuse for the continu-
ation of the gentleman’s crooked dealing after
bankruptcy had begun to stare him in the face,
or to prove that Roberts wasn’t fairly started
on the road to bankruptcy when he first
“ left the money to take its chance.”
That was in May, 1889. Everybody’s dream
of wealth was already vanishing at that time.
But no matter. Justice a’Beckett gave the
dishonest solicitor the benefit of the wealth
theory, and then found himself “ relieved of
the obligations of taking the more serious view
which might be taken, yet considered that Mr.
Roberts should not go unpunished.” So, Mr.
Roberts was suspended from the practice of
his honorable profession —0, ye gods ! —for one
year. In twelve calendar months he will be a
protected solicitor once again. The joke of
this sentence upon Roberts lies chiefly in the
preamble to his Honor’s judgment. “In the
interests of the public and the reputation of
the profession, the view with which the court
regarded lawyers’ delinquencies had to be con-
sidered. It would be a lamentable thing if any
idea of indifference to these interests were to
prevail with the public, or that it should be
supposed that the court acted on a low view of
the moral and legal obligations of legal prac-
titioners.” It is lamentable that the aforesaid
idea does prevail, and that Judge a’Beckett
has helped to strengthen it.
The Three Laws.
There is one law for the rich, another for the
poor, and a third for people connected with
the legal profession. That case of the Mel-
bourne solicitor’s clerk, a junior, whose em-
bezzlements earned only a modest fine from
magistrate Panton, was the “curtain-raiser”
preceding the piece de resistance. Next day,
one Gillies pleaded guilty in Melbourne Crimi-
nal Court to “larceny as a servant” of the
same legal firm which figured in the police-
court farce. Gillies was the confidential or
managing clerk, and had worked a system of
embezzlement in conjunction with the junior
culprit. There were no extenuating features
in the dishonesty of Gillies. He is the
typical flash bachelor of 34, the man about
town who goes astray with a big cigar between
his teeth, plays cards at the club, and fools
around methodically. He was arrested on a
warrant in W.A., and had a “ real good time”
on his way back to Melbourne —as good a time
as circumstances would permit. When he
sailed, in care of the detective, from Adelaide, a
number of rollicking sympathisers gave him a
“ send off,” and, having arrived at Melbourne,
he proceeded to “ do ” the Block, and his other
familiar haunts, on bail. If he showed any signs
of penitence or shame for his discreditable
position, they were not visible through the
smoke of his bulky havannah. Perhaps there was
ho occasion for penitence, seeing that fraudulent
lawyers are indigenous to Melb. ,and Gillieswrs
merely in the fashion. Nevertheless, his jaunty
demeanor prior to coming up for sentence
deserves special mention, as indicating a legal
sense of security under conditions which might
have given a commercial traveller, or a
draper’s assistant, much anxiety. Gillies, as
already stated, was a systematic embezzler, and
responsible for his confederate’s crime. His
“larcenies” were many and frequent. He
pleaded guilty to two specified loots. Justice
Hood then said that the case was very “diffi-
cult to deal with ’’—being “ that of a man who
held a respectable position and had plunged
himself into crime.” What Justice Hood might
have said was that the “difficulty” in the
way of dealing fairly with Gillies was
the prisoner’s line of business. . His particular
respectability lay in his connection with the
almighty law. Justice Hood, it seems, felt so
concerned about his duty to Gillies that he
consulted another Judge, and the upshot of
their deliberations was the immediate release
of the unfortunate “bounder” on his own re-
cognisances, and one surety of .£5O. The free
and frequent embezzler was accorded “a second
chance,” chiefly on the ground that “ his em-
ployers appeared to have been quite content at
one time that he should have escaped without
further punishment” than the loss of his billet.
This cheerful encouragement to the robbery of
kindly-disposed employers, coming from a
Judge, would sound strange but for the fact
that Gillies belonged to the privileged pro-
fession. One law for the rich, another for the
poor, and a third for the lawyers.
Fair Dinkum.
The Nemesis that seldom overtakes commercial
crime has seen fit to wreak mild vengeance
upon the importing firm of Lazarus, Rosen-
fkld and Benjamin. Four men concerned in
the management of the firm’s Melbourne busi-
ness were last week sentenced to imprisonment
and fines for “conspiring to defraud Her
Majesty’s Customs.” Tins description of the
offence is misleading. It was not a case of
merely “ chousing ” the Victorian revenue out
of a certain amount of duty chargeable upon cer-
tain goods; it was a case of stealing cash from
the exchequer by means of excessive drawback
claims. Lazarus, Rosenfeld and Co., having
paid duty to the Victorian Customs depart-
ment on account of foreign fancy goods
landed at Melbourne, transhipped the stuff
to Sydney or other Australian ports at
an advanced valuation, and received from
the department more “ drawback ” money than
they had paid. The difference between the
original duty and subsequent drawback repre-
sented theft to that amount. Messrs. Rosen-
feld, Davis, Benjamin and Stanway have
properly gone to gaol, and three of them are
working out their terms with hard labor. Their
case exhibits the immorality of Melbourne
sentiment in a strong light. When the men
received their sentences they were said to have
“ hard luck ! ” in a comparative way of speak-
ing. It was “ hard luck !•” because other con-
victed Customs swindlers have escaped im-
prisonment, and the great mass of such
swindlers have hitherto escaped prosecution.
The common acceptance of this “ hard luck ! ”
theory recalls Alfred Deakin’s barristerial
plea for the financial rogue—“ they all
did it in boom time.” In Melbourne’s
mercantile world they have all done it
always, and with the advance in Customs
duties they have done it more than ever.
“ Lines ” shipped under an undutiable (and
generally correct) heading, have been re-shipped
as dutiable, every penny of drawback in those
cases being stolen from the State. The secret
history of the softgoods warehouses stinks of
criminal offence; intercolonial “trade” in
many things is only a bogus dealing between
two branches of the same business for the pur-
pose of drawback robbery. Under-statements
of cost are almost as much the rule as the excep-
tion. The dishonest trader denounced by Jus-
tice Hodges, who “ dresses in purple and fine
linen, and rides in a sumptuously-cushioned
carriage, whilst the honest trader is driven to
insolvency or the streets,” is a übiquitous
Barabbas. Everybody seems to be seized, as
they say in the senates, of his malefactions,
and most people complacently regard them as
the natural outcome of Victorian government,
the product of political corruption. If banking
and land-company swindles have been per-
petrated with impunity, why should the dis-
honored arm of the law strike at the black
heart of commerce, and, if it must strike, why
not hit fair ? What have Rosenfeld and his
colleagues done that is worse than the doings
of a hundred other silk-hatted tricksters ?
There is some comfort in the shocking indig-
nation with which Collins-st. mutters this
enquiry. Nobody demanded positive justice
for the community during the years when
fraud ran riot, but now that the “potting”
of the miserable Abrahams crowd has
been followed by the “jugging” of the
Rosenfeld party, a desire for comparative jus-
tice fills the air, and tends to make it sweeter.
Every sinful calico-jimmy roaming at large is
an insult to the doctrine of “fair dinkum”
which all men, rogues or otherwise, hold in
respect. Let Nemesis take her course since
she has been permitted to taste a little Hebrew
blood. Give the Presbyterians, Wesleyans,
Baptists, and Episcopal Church supporters a
chance to say their prayers in a dungeon-cell !
Not for the sake of the national character and
public honour, but in the name of “ fair
dinkum.”
Fat Man Patriotism.
The Fat Men of Sydney Chamber of Commerce
had an unusual outbreak of candor the other
day, when the committee presented its annual
report with the following clause embodied
therein:
The community have watched with great interest the
recent taxation proposals of the Government; but, while
the major portion are undoubtedly Freetraders, they are
somewhat inclined to modify their views when they find
at what cost they are to obtain Freetrade.
This evidently meant that the committee-men,
being importers, were also Freetraders, so long
as some one else had to pay for Freetrade, but
when the price of that policy was exacted from
themselves in the shape of a land and income
tax, they began to think they would just as
soon have the other thing. They were not sure
about the point, but were in a state of sus-
pended fiscal animation, waiting to see what
the price would amount to. The fact that they
professed to speak of “the community” rather
than of themselves didn’t really alter the brutal
candor of the statement ; the obvious fact
remained that the committee had no defined
views apart from its own interests, and had
merely pretended to have Freetrade convic-
tions, and that it only professed to think that
its professed Freetrade convictions were bene-
ficial to the country, because they were profit-
able to itself. The clause was almost allowed
to pass unchallenged, but at the last
moment Mr. S. A. Joseph drew atten-
tion to it, and then the Chamber struck it
out —no doubt feeling that it was advertising its
want of political principle too glaringly. Never-
theless, if S. A. Joseph hadn’t moved in the
matter, the signs are that the rest of the Cham-
ber would have let the statement pass without
dissent. The average Fat Man feels that way ;
the only trouble is that a certain amount of
nerve is required to stand up in front of an
aggressive person named Joseph, and maintain
that he feels that way for purely patriotic and
unselfish reasons.
A Point of Law.
The New South Wales courts have been wrest-
ling at great length with an abstruse question
about the delivery of a summons. The law
-tates that, in certain cjvses, “ notice in writing
-hall be delivered ” to defendant or “ left at his
usual place of abode.” In the present instance
the notice was delivered to him in an envelope
by the postman, and it was also left at his usual
place of abode, he being there when the post-
man arrived. There are no stipulations in the
Act as to whether it is to be left or delivered
by a postman or by any other specified indivi-
dual ; the only legal requirement is that the
document is to get there. I he defendant,
however, claimed that this was not delivery
“ within the meaning of the Act,” and Judge
Fxtzhardingk nonsuited plaintiff accordingly.
There was an appeal to the Supreme Court,
and two expensive Judges, three barristers and
four solicitors wrestled with the question.
Finally they came to the decision that as the
Act said the document was to be delivered, and
nothing more, therefore it simply meant that it
was to be delivered, and whether it was delivered
by a postman, or a vagrant, or a red-headed
woman, or a person with bow-legs didn’t matter
so long as it was delivered, and as defendant
admitted that it was delivered, and had ad-
mitted it all along, therefore the Court’s
decision was that it had been delivered.
Accordingly, the case was sent back to be tried,
the two separate bills of costs incurred up to
date not having advanced the real question at
issue by so much as one inch. The fact that it
took one Judge, two barristers, two solicitors,
and one bill of costs to decide in the first place
that the paper hadn’t been delivered, though
the defendant admitted getting it, and two
Judges, seven barristers and solicitors, and
another bill of costs to decide afterwards that,
as the defendant got it, it must have actually
arrived, is a beautiful evidence of the learned
profundity of the law. Evidently what New
South Wales wants now is a statute setting
forth that when a document has arrived at its
destination that fact shall be sufficient evidence
that it has got there, and that if it has really
got there in the ordinary sense of the term it
shall also have done it “ within the meaning of
the Act.”
The Absentee.
When the N.S.W. Land and Income Tax Bill
makes its next appearance before Parliament,
two or three anomalous features, which passed
unnoticed on its first introduction, might be
amended with great advantage. One relates to
the situation of the foreign mortgagee. The
bill places the local mortgagee and the local
landowner on the same footing, rightly con-
sidering that the former is, to all intents and
purposes, a landowner for the time being. But
though it lays a special tax—much too small a
one, however —on the chronically-absent land-
holder, it lays no extra impost whatever on the
absent mortgagee. If the latter forecloses his
mortgage, and becomes the nominal owner of
the land, then the extra tax falls upon him
straightway, but until then the fact that he is
an absentee is wholly disregarded. According
to all reason and logic the absent mortgagee
and the absent landholder should stand on the
same footing. Again, though the private
absentee landholder is specially discouraged,
though in a pitiably ineffective fashion, the
absentee corporation is, so far as can be gathered
from the text of the measure, wholly disre-
garded. The landholding company which has
its head office, chief managers, and all, or the
majority of, its shareholders in England, and
which sends the great bulk of its profits to
that country, is as distinctly an absentee as
any private individual can be, and the
fact that it may have a branch office and a
deputy manager, and a subordinate board of
directors, and, possibly, a few casual share-
holders in Australia, makes no real difference.
Moreover, it is much more in need of active
discouragement than the private owner, partly
because it represents a very much larger evil,
and partly because it is the more incurable
absentee of the two. The bill may possibly
be intended to cover absentee corporations, but
in that case it is much too vague and ineffectual
to serve its purpose. It states that any
“ owner ” who has not resided in New South
Wales for four out of the preceding six years
shall be liable to pay an extra tax ; and the in-
terpretation clause explains that an owner
means any person who possesses land, and,
further on, that the word “person” includes
“ company.” But as it altogether fails to state
that the possession of a local office for the pur-
pose of collecting the loot and despatching it to
England does not constitute residence, the
foreign landholding corporation stands the
best possible chance of escaping the extra tax,
along with his brother and accomplice, the
foreign mortgagee. And a third important
discrepancy is that there is no provision for
levying a special income-tax on the absentee,
as well as a special land-tax. Therefore
the incomes derived by residents abroad from
gold and other mines, house-rents, annuities,
or from any other source save land, the
large sums earned in the province by
foreign banks, and life, fire, and marine insur-
ance companies, the profits from money invested
in liens in wool and stock, and from miscellaneous
trading enterprises, all go free of any special
tax. And when these are added to the vast
amounts taken out of the country by foreign
mortgagees and landholding companies, there is
so little absentee-tax left as not to be worth
the name. Moreover, in one astounding
instance the absentee is specially released from
all tax while the local resident is not. Among
the income-tax exemptions is < “ Income accru-
ing to any person not resident in Neiv South
Wales from Government debentures.” If the
exemption covered all debentures sold prior to
the passing of the Act it would be understand-
able, as to sell debentures at a fixed rate of
interest and then deduct a tax would be some-
thing very like a breach of faith. But Premier
Reid proposes to deliberately perpetrate this
breach of faith on the local investor, while the
foreigner goes free, now and for ever after-
wards. In other words, the foreign money-
lender is offered a higher rate of interest than
the local one, and a special effort is made to
prevent New South Wales ever becoming inde-
pendent of the British Shyi.ock. This is about
the worst inversion of the absentee-tax idea on
record.

Barrister Duffy’s gibe, in the Abrahams
case, that those lovely rascals were being pro-
secntecl nob merely because they were gun-
forgers, but because they were Jews, would
appear in the light of later events to have con
siderable foundation in fact. While the cata.
lepbic ones are scarcely entered on the era ol
their 1,2 months hard, another Hebrew firm i.i
criminally arraigned for falsifying manifest*
and swindling the Customs out of “divers
moneys.” Ib is duly found guilty ; the pro-
prietor gets nine months, t lie manager and
book-keeper six months, and the shipping-clerk
(he, no doubt, had to help the swindle or lose
his billet) three months—the principals also
having to pay commensurate fines. So far,
so good, but the Jewish faction down
South is pertinently asking why a certain
saintly Christian jeweller, who has systemati-
cally diddled the Customs on week-days and
piously turned up at church on Sundays, should
have been allowed to go free of prosecution on
paying a huge sum to the revenue ; why another
bowled-out Kerristian jeweller satisfied the
authorities by dropping his little mite in the
slot; and why the genial head of a most respect-
able Gentile firm, who, it was lately found, had
buncoed the revenue of his confiding country
for many months, is not now doing lapidary
work in Pentridge Stockade beside Abrahams
and Rosenfeld. The Chosen race seem to be
chosen with a vengeance.
Ah accused person awaiting trial is supposed to
be treated as innocent until he is found guilty ;
but in N.S. Wales, if unable to get bail, he is
not only held in confinement, but also subjected
to penal discipline. Prisoners committed for
trial are not allowed to see newspapers or
receive any general information from the out-
side world. They are compelled to attend a
church service twice a week, or be confined
in cells while the service is going on.
They are allowed to smoke only dark
twist tobacco, and must use a clay pipe. •
Should a warder behave improperly by, say,
striking a man awaiting trial, and the victim,
in complaining, apply any derogatory epithet
to the bully, he is locked up in a separ-
ate cell till the visiting magistrate sits,
and tried for a prison crime. All this is under-
stood to be warranted by the regulations made
by the Governor-in-Council. Now, a prisoner
who is not yet tried is a citizen who is giving
the security of his body for his appearance
before the court, and not a person who has
become liable to anything different from the
ordinary laws of the land. Such a man should
not be subjected to treatment to which an out-
side citizen is not subject, except in so far as
requisite to hold his person for trial. But,
according to the practice, any man —at all
events, any poor man—can be taken out of the
operation of the ordinary laws of the land, and
subjected to a different set of laws of the most
arbitrary and tyrannical kind, at the simple
pleasure of anyone who will cause him to be
arrested, and of any magistrate who will fix a
prohibitory bail.

A London paper affects to be shocked by the
bad taste of certain music-hall verses which
assume the guilt of Jabez Balfour —or Mr.
Spencer Balfour, as the writer styles him.
Fat Man’s cry of “Shame ! ” upon people who
roughly and readily criticised the Melbourne
bank-busters a while ago is recalled to memory
by this solicitude for poor dear “ Mr.
Spencer.” The fact is that Balfour has stood
convicted of crooked dealing ever since the
figures of his hopelessly insolvent financial
institutions were published. Also, he pleaded
guilty by his flight to Argentina, and his
persistent refusal to leave that place of refuge.
Whether he gets sent to prison or nob has
nothing bo do with the case as judged by
the public to whom popular rhymesters appeal.
The bloated creature richly deserves punish-
ment, but he would never have been put in
the way to receive it if the unjudicially-
minded masses hadn’t “ stuck to their man,”
so to speak, and yelled for the police until the
Rosebery Government gave the signal for his
arrest, an event that took a long time to trans-
pire, anyhow. Should Balfour’s financial
transactions escape a fair trial, and an acquittal
of the prisoner be accomplished by “ influence ”
for influential reasons, the accusing figures will
still stand in the books, and if in the general
British opinion they look as black as ever, the
general opinion will remain undisturbed. Also,
ib will express itself in a more or less riotous
manner. Victoria seems bo be the only English-
speaking country where hard facts are easily
dissolved in bucketfuls of legal drivel, and
nobody objects to the vanishing-trick.
S.A, Co., the bloated absentee concern
which has sweated rents out of S.A. producers for
nearly 60 years, lately held its annual meeting in
London, and much bad language was expended
over the “ decreased div. through progressive land
taxation in the colony.” This is something for
the Tory papers to digest. When progressive
taxation was proposed it was alleged that the poor
producer would have to pay. But he doesn’t.
He can’t pay any more and live, so the London
man must give up a little of his turkey and fizz.
Staughton, M.L.A., a squat squatter in
Vic. Assembly, objected to the Govt, proposals re
the duty on monumental stones, the other night,
because, “under the proposal, he believed the
poor man would have to pay more for his tomb,
stone.” Noble generosity !
Melbourne Argus : —“The lobbying which
has become a public scandal in Victoria is simply
the outward and visible sign of the demoralisation
to which Protection invariably leads.” The
Argus evidently imagines that the person who
button-holes members in the Parliamentary lobby
is never, by any chance, an importer who wants
duties taken off, or a prohibitionist, or a person
who wants to raise the age of consent, or a man
who wants a billet, or anything else save an
utterly unprincipled Protectionist. A lobbyist,
by the way, is a man who goes to see a member
about a grievance, and it has never been shown
that he is necessarily any more scandalous than
the man who goes to see an editor about a para-
era ph.
If the gentlemen vvho’re stigmatised as “ Fats ”
Are allowed a little tariff that just suits—
That will ask no toll on glossy Paris hats,
Nor on porpoise-hide when fashioned into boots,
Nor on grand pianos, gems, nor crusted wines—
A tariff that will make importers sure
Of big profits—Mr. Stoughton, he opines,
They will generously struggle to procure
At the least cheap German tombstones for the poor.

“The Shop Girl,” which has succeeded
“ In Town ” at Sydney Lyceum, is (as The Bul-
letin mentioned on its Melb. appearance) the
work of a person alleged to he named Dam.
Judging hy the result, however, this paper now
concludes that Dam is merely a feeble alias, and
that the author’s name is really Blast. The “Shop
Girl ” is very much like its two predecessors, and
they were very much like it, and also presented a
strong resemblance to each other, and till three
were so much the same that they could hardly he
bold apart. The characters are nominally differ-
ent, also the songs and the high kick and the
tiling which Dam, or Curse, or whatever his name
may he, calls the plot, hut they alt convey the
same suggestion of the tired and morally-diseased
dude in “Lady Windermere’s Fan ” set to music.
Also, they all vaguely suggest a butterfly coming
home drunk in the small hours of the morning.
The semblance of a plot is based on the fact that
a shop-girl—name unknown, hut identifiable hy a
strawberry-mark on her left shoulder—who was
abandoned on a doorstep in infancy, litis become
heiress to a fortune of -JH.OOO.tOO. There are 400
girls in the emporium, and five different indivi-
duals, including it French nobleman, want to
examine all their shoulders at once. Finally a
girl with a mark on the middle of her hack so
nearly wins the prize that Moo ley, the fatuous,
red-headed emporium-proprietor, rushes her off to
a registrar and marries her on the spot. The pro-
ceedings are thereafter diversified hy music and
dancing, and the anguish of a love-sick
shop-walker with a stutter in his feet,
and hy the irruptions of an old lady in
a rainbow dress, and hy an ancient joke about
eggs, and other things, till, at 10.30, it proves
that Maud Hobson’s mark is in the wrong place,
and Decima Moore, whose mark is in the right
place, takes the pool, A number of other ladies,
whose marks have been inspected and found un-
satisfactory, are rejected at an earlier stage of the
proceedings.

The emporium in the first act is depress-
ing, and suggests that Ilooley’s stock is run low,
awaiting fresh shipments. Act 11. is full of dazzle
and brilliance, hut hy that time all the ladies’
marks seem to have been inspected, and a good
deal of interest has consequently worn off, and the
play begins to roll in its stride, and is badly
bumped as it comes into the straight with four
feet of water in the hold, and its legs evidently
giving out. Bradfleld, as the medical student, is
only a duplicate of Bradfleld as the captain in
the last production, and Monklionse as Hooley
(or Hooley as Monkhouse, whichever it may he)
lias no conspicuous points about him, Fred Kaye,
as a shop-walker i’u the first act and an ancient
Roman in the second, is the only person who
seems to strike a new idea, and Maud Hobson’s
song, "Found on a doorstep at half past nine,” is
about the only ditty which sounds reasonably
new. All the same. The Bulletin hereby pro-
phesies that the “Shop Girl” wdl do well.

Sydney Criterion, the home of high-class
comedy in the palmy days of B. and 8., re-opens
on Saturday in the old line of business. That
prince of managers and universal favorite, Mr. L.
J. Lohr, is the lessee. The company includes
“ Billy ” Elton, Geo. Ireland, Lachlan M’Gowan,
Westmacott, Mrs. Walter Hill, the beautiful
Miss Harrie Ireland, Miss Blanche Carlyle (of
“Charley’s Aunt”), and other good names. The
season commences with “The Guv’nor”—apiece
of the kind for which the Criterion used to he
famous, before B. and B. went wandering after
the strange society drama of the kind written hy
Oscar Wilde (now detained by urgent business in
a large stone building). Sydney of late has had
nothing but large, hulking drama, and various
kinds of variety, and there should he a great
demand for another season of good comedy—the
kind that has no woman with a barrowing past.

The two old variety shows at the Tivoli
and Empire are alive and well, but the attempt
to run a third one fell flat, and the ill-starred
enterprise dried up. There wasn’t enough of it
for one thing, and a very thin programme was
dragged out like a racked heretic to make it cover
the space, and the pianist was always threatening
to slide off a chair which was much too high for
him. If the show had lasted much longer he
would certainly have slid off on to the floor, and
perhaps humped himself fatally, so it may he that
its ending was all fur the best.

The heroic deeds of Private Rignold with
the British flag in the limelight have kept
“ Youth ” going for three weeks at Her Majesty’s,
and it is to he succeeded on Saturday hy that reli-
able old production, “The World Against Her.”
Said production isn’t quite so new as it was, hut,
having been made of good material at the start,
it will probably wear a little while longer. Never-
theless, it begins to assume a greenish aspect when
viewed sideways in a strong light, and to exhibit
snail-tracks along the seams.

ITaddon Chambers’ play “ John-<\-Dreams”
turns out to he only a high-flown melodrama with
an irrelevant spicy episode wedged into the middle
of it. The heroine volunteers a confession that
she was an improper female in days of yore, when
she lived with an unvirtuous mother, now deceased,
witose conduct she “ gives away ” for the sole pur-
pose of remarking that “ we ought always to speak
well of the dead.” There the matter ends. An
aged parson betrays his feelings in a Look of
Horror for one moment. The next moment he
withdraws the Look unconditionally, and goes on
reverencing the young woman as usual, despite
her unpleasant Past. Also, the ardent lover
makes no objection to her Past, and her reason
for having had one at all becomes wrapped in
mystery. Haddon Chambers might just as well
have inserted the ghost of Coriolanns, with in-
structions to relate the story of OKI Mother Hub-
hard, and then vanish from the plot.
One week of “John it- Dreams ” was more
than enough for Melbourne, and on Saturday
“The Amazons” brought sunshine baok to the
Princess’s. It would seem that Pinero’s fanciful
comedy improves with age. Anyw’ay, the extra-
vaganza, of Messrs. Boucicault and Cecil Ward,
who now play their parts in a rather more comic-
opera spirit than before, lias improved upon its
original popularity. A patriotic Frenchman,
perhaps, might object to such a riotous caricature
as tbe Count de Grival if there were no Earl of
Tween wayes to keep the foreign nobleman in
countenance. Tween wayes, the hereditary ruin,
has crumbled a good deal since his previous
efforts on the same stage. He is gone over further
at tlie knees, and the blind staggers which his
family acquired in the Crusades threaten to double
him up forever in the course of a few more revivals.
Also his racial incapacity for tea and his high-born
dread of Hereford bulls are getting worse as time
goes on. Tweenwayes and the Count played some
of their peculiarities to elm gallery on Saturday, lint
with the best results. “The Amazons” travelled
like the whirlwind, although its charming female
interest is slightly weakened hy changes in the
cast. By the way, critical exception might he
taken to that carpet of fallen leaves in the sylvan
glade. In the first place they clearly haven't
fallen from the trees, which are still full of foliage,
and are only just beginning to take autumnal
tints. Secondly, the leaves are dry, find there-
fore out of accord with the pains in Cecil Ward’s
tummy. “ When the air is cold and damp, the
true De Bray must suffer cramp.”

On Saturday, the B. and B. Co. will try
yet another new show—“ The Importance of
Being Earnest.” This is understood to he a light
and cheerful comedy, hy the author of “ An Ideal
Husband.” In fact, it was written hy the late
Oscar Wilde, not long prior to that unhappy per-
son’s social decease, when dungeon shadows were
already creeping athwart his literary career, and
mental anxiety had sharpened his sense of humor.

“ A Sailor’s Knot ” crowds Melbourne
Royal every evening. All the melodramas produced
this season have caught on, hut the “Knot” got
such a firm grip of the populace that it might
have hung on for a month at least if other
arrangements didn’t compel it to shift. Mrs.
Bland Holt and the manager who hears her
name are responsible for the triumph of this par-
ticular festival. They occupy a strong position in
the centre of the plot, and hurl comic relief at the
surrounding sin and misery. When Joe gets
taken prisoner in France; his constant Margery
consoles herself hy sneaking certain despatches
from Marshal Ney to a cockney hoat-hnilder, and
when somebody announces Wellington’s victory
on the Field of Waterloo (which was quite un-
known by that name at the time) the historic
event is felt to lie merely an unimportant detail in
the lives of Margery and Joe, aforesaid. “A
Sailor’s Knot” will he followed, on Saturday
(10th), by “Saved from the Sea,” a drama full of
the odor of brine and entirely novel sensations.
In tliis Mias Elizabeth Watson makes her first

The Opera House show, which ranges
from substantial Larry Dooley down to a fragile
infant who twangs a banjo on rudimentary princi-
ples, is in a prosperous state as usual, whilst the
Oxford remains open without seeming to prosper
much. The varieties there are not feebler on an
average than other varieties that have made
money, but Melbourne doesn't particularly want
more than one joy of the kind, and Rickards sup-
plies the wanted one. The little Cambridge
Theatre is about to re-open for gospel services, and
a dog-show is now in full cry at the Exhibition
building.
After long weeks of morbid “ passion play”
That tells the woe
Of some strange woman who has gone astray,
Or fain would go—
How pleasant, in a woodland scene, to meet
The Amazons ! three maidens fresh and sweet;
Their moral purpose hut a quaint conceit
By Pinero.
How good to see them posing ’noath the trees,
Those daughter-sons.
In pantaloons cut justTielow the knees—
Oh, pretty ones !
No awful past beclouds their present joys.
No vain remorse their peace of mind destroys—
Three jolly girls are they disguised as hoys,
The Amazons.

Oov. Robinson has had a rehearsal of his “ Fredaloros ”
In the theatre of the Prince of Wales Club, Amy Sherw in,
and others taking parts, whilst Alfred Plumplou made as
much as he could of a scratch orchestra. 1 don’t think
that the operetta will readily find a place in any London

The three brightest ditties sung in “The Shop Girl”
are annexations. Decitm Moore gets her “Di 1 Di! ”
from a modern outrage called “Go Bang.” The original
singer of “ Di ! Di !" was Letty Lind, or perhaps the fair
Letty picked it up at one of the ’alls; anyway she, with
her rather husky notes and better-trained legs, made a
gooii deal more ontof the number than little Miss Decima
could. Bradfield’s song, “Do not trust him,” was either
written for or interpolated hy Arthur Roberts in the
"Don Juan” burlesque, and Roberts sang it distinctly
better than Bradtield tn the opinion of people who have
heard both. Another rorty ballad, which Bradfleld does
no sort of justice to, is “Her gulden hair was hanging
down her hack.” This is a hackneyed music-hall pro-
duction only suitable for a woman. Alice Leamar
“ knocks ’em ” with “ Her Golden Hair,” and Priscilla
Verne, at Melb. Opera House, takes the shine out of
BradfleUFs mechanical rendering of it. Yet the mildest
suggestion that Bradfleld was not brilliant in this or many
other songs would he blasphemy just at present. Let a
clever comedian get hold of a very fat part, and for the
next few weeks he is a god. Ask Elton

Apropos of a recent Bulletin paragraph, Mr. 11. J.
Samuel), music-publisher, writes: "Nellie Stewart sang
A. VV. Juncker's song ‘I was Dreaming’ purely on its
merits. When ‘Ma Mie Rosette’ was to be produced in
Melb. Miss Stewart wanted a song to replace one written
by the composer of ihe opera for the second act. She
tried over several, and was leaving the stage at rehearsal
in disgust when, looking on top of the piano, she said,
1 By the wav, Caron, here is a song just come by post ;
let’s try it,’ It was ‘I was Dreaming.’ Miss Stewart liked
it at once. Conductor Caron did not; hut, anyhow, MissS.
said, • Let ns have a cadenza at the end ; ask Barker to
oblige with a harp obligato, and I’ll fix the words—
because, the second act of “Ma Mie Rosette ” being a
dream, it won’t do to give it away.’ Hence Miss Stewart
sang ‘I have been thinking.’ 'And that is why many
never knew she sing ‘ I was Dreaming.’ And that,
too, is why the publisher rlid not pay her a royalty. I
wanted to give Miss Stewart a diamond bangle, but
manager Musgrovesdd a royalty or nothing, and, under
the circumstances, I really felt hound to decline paying
royalty.”

That proviso in Premier Reid’s Land and In-
come Tax Bill which exempts from tax all incomes' arising
from N.S.W. Govt, debentures held hy people outside the
province mill/, is a horrible example of the worst jdnd of
Foreign-trade policy. With the income-tax at Is. in the
£ the result would he that the large foreign holder of 3£
per cent. Govt, debentims would get J 3 10s. per cent, on
his investment, while the one in the province would get
just, £3 6s. 6<i. Thus, if a N.S.W. institu lion put
£1,000,000 of its money in local Stale securities it would
get t!750 a year less net interest than would an English,
or Queensland, or Maoriland, or Chinese institution u tier
the like circumstances! The idea of offering special
advantages to the foreigner in preference to ids own
people is a piece of foolishness of which only the O. 11.
Keid kind of person is capable. Any individual with a
little more brain and a little less waistcoat circumference
would have given any possible advantage to the local
investor.
It would be a breach of faith to tax the divi-
dends of the existing British stockholder, so he isn’t to
he taxed. It would he mere foolishness to tax the future
British stockholder, for if he was offered the present rate
of interest, less income-tax, he would simply offer has
for the stock, and the result would be as broad as it is
long—perhaps a lit tle broader. Whether it is equally a
breach of faith to tax the dividends of the existing local
holder is not the question at issue. In the interests of
common sense he should be exempt now and for ever.
The amount to be raised hy a tax on the miserably small
amount of local divs. is next to nothing. And if Govt,
stocks were exempted they would become a favorite
form c( local investment, and that fact would materially
help along the time when N.S. Wales would he indepen-
dent of the British money-lender. Moreover, if they were
exempted from taxation the Government could sell new
issues at a higher rate, so that it would probably gain
almost ns much ns it would lose, •fhe Govt, stock-holder
does not require legislative discouragement, like the land,
holder ; he grabs no unearned increment; he doesn’t
block settlement; and he gets a very small rate of
interest. To exempt him from income-tax might not be
abstract justice, hut, at all events, it would be a wise
policy.

Goldsbrongh, Morfc and Co. propose to recon-
struct by cancelling t wo-and-a-half millions of 5 per
cent, debentures, and issuing in their stead one half the
amount in 4 percent, debentures and one-half in dehen.
tures hearing interest at 3 per cent. This will make the
average rale of interest 3i per cent, instead of five—a
saving of over £37,000 a year. Under the 1803 recon-
struction, 10s. per share was written off. and another P's.
per share has since been called up. It is now proposed to
call up £2 more per share, and shareholders who pay in
full before the Ist October and then agree to write off
another 10a. per share, are to be freed from all further
liability in the matter of calls. Also, if the co. wants to
pay off its debentures at any time it has the privilege of
doing so hy paying £lO5 for every £lOO debenture. If
this scheme through it will probably save the good
old firm of G.M. and Co. from something mueh worse in
the future, hut, all the same, the eall will smash a good
many shareholders. This miserable country is full of
calls already.

The City of Melbourne Bank’s English creditors
propose a reconstruction scheme of their own. Its main
points are that the deposits are to be divided into A
debentures at. 4 percent, and B debentures at 2 per cent,
interest, so that the rate all round will be 3 per cent.’
instead of the present 4J. Further, the directors are to
be five in number, three elected hy the British deposi-
tors, one by the Australian depositors, and one by the
shareholders. And when the depositors run the show
and root out the doings of the old management, and make
calls to the amount of t’400,000 or so, and proceed to sell
up the management’s friends for their overdrafts, there will
be great doings. By far the b« st thing the shareholders
can do under these circumstances is to ask for a release
from further liabilities and hand over the whole hank.

At the annual meeting of the A.J.S. Bank the
chairman is reported (both hy S..M. IIKRAM) and Sydney
D.T.) as saying; ‘ During the half-year we have been
enabled to discharge the extended'deposits of the old
bank hy the large amount of £421,569.” A comparison
of the last two halai oc-sheets doesn’t quite hear out
this statement. In the document of six months ago
the fixed deposits appeared under three heads: “new
deposits,” “deposits of old hank extended for long
periods.” and “ inscribed stock deposits.” This time they
appear under three different heads : “ fix d deposits
extended up to Dec., 1901.” “ fixed deposits extended up
to 1907 and new deposits,” and “inscribed stock deposits."
The “ fixed deposits extended up to 1901 ” in the present
balance-sheet are £421,569 less than the “fixed deposits
extended for long periods” in the previous one, hut it
doesn’t appear that the A.J.S. has discharged liabilities
to that extent, if “ dischai ging" means to pay off in
actual cash. It seems to have simply paid one-half of
them, or rather more, according to the offer which it
made to its depositors, anil renewed the balance, the
amount renewed forming the item "deposits extended
up to 1907,” which now appears for the first time. This
being confused with the “ new deposits ” it is impossible
to say how much has been renewed. It would he interes-
ting to know why the form of the balance-sheet has been
altered, especially as it obscures this interesting item of

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION. ,
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and di'igent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who lhakes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

ing 70 per cent, of the deposits to be repaid in 35 years,

The Investment Agency Co. of Australasia is
the latest British idea for exploiting these provinces. Its
mission is to raise large sums on debentures and other-

Invest these borrowed moneys and its own capital in first-
class Australian securities, such as the shares of two or
three leading banks and insurance companies, municipal
debentures, &c. If well managed it will probably realise 6s.
or 10s. more per cent, on its investments than it lias topay
to its debenture-holders, and pay dividends out of the
difference. There is no end to the devices of the awful
Bull to make money, with the least possible amount of
risk and no hard work, out of these miserable “colonies,"
and until every kind of absentee landlord, speculator,
trader, mortgagee, and miscellaneous cormorant is hear ily
taxed for being an absentee, the eating-up process will go
on and on and on into the endless perspective of Hades.

A Municipal Fire Insurance Bill has been intro-
in Maorilshd Parliament. It authorises each municipal
council to value all the buildings within its boundaries—
certain extra hazardous risks excepted—and then impose
an insurance-rate on the owners. Every owner whose
rate is paid will thereby be held insured for the ensuing
year to three-fourths of the value of bis property. The
beneficial feal ure of this scheme is that it will provide
cheap insurance by saving the heavy item of commission
to agents and much of the clerical expenses. And, on the
other hand, it appears to he utterly inefficient on two
points. A municipal valuation is generally very low, and
three-fourths of it will be a wholly insufficient pro-
tection ; if the scheme is to be put on anything like
an equitable footing it will be necessary to insure
up to at least nine-tenths of the valuation. Also, there
seems to he no provision for insuring the contents
of the buildings, and if a man has to insure his building
with the municipal office and his furniture or slock with
some private institution, the new scheme will only he, to
very many people, an aggravated nuisance. If the muni-
cipality was allowed, however, to compulsorily insure all
the insurable property within its limits up to 90 percent,
of its estimated value, then the experiment would he
worth trying as another move in the direction of Stale
and municipal socialism.

The Melb. directors of the Proprietary mine
who rushed to Broken Hill at great speed per special
train immediately news of the fire reached them, took
a supply of “chemicals,” with which to subdue the fire.
Said chemicals, when overhauled by practical people at
the mine, were found to consist of a quantity of com-
pressed carbonic acid of the kind used by serated-water
manufacturers, sufficient, when liberated, to fill a fairly
large room with the gas. Whereat much irreverent mirth
at the mine, where the practical off! 'inis had made
arrangements to produce the carbonic acid gas (by roast-
ing coke and limestone) at the rate of many millions of
cubic feet per hour. All sorts of inventors have
besieged the Proprietary management with suggestions
of all degrees of absurdity for the extinction of the fire,
hub the directors, with their bottles of carbonic acid, are
conceded to have taken the cake.
Which circuitously recalls that at the time
of the Broken Hill water-famine an anxious mother, who
had read the newspapers and pictured her son at Broken
Hill dying a lingering death from thirst, sent him from
Adelaide a 400-gal. tank of water—cost of carriage, £8
something. The same quantity of water could have been
bought at Broken Hill for t 3.
Not much is heard as to the probable origin of
the (ire at the Proprietary mine. But as the afternoon
shifts in the open cut had lately been working by the
light of bonfires of old mine timber, the new regime of
economy having brought about a reduction of t he electric-
lighting, and as the lire is held to have started from the
surface, the matter, so they say at Broken Hill, does not
leave much room for doubt.

The fire, which broke out in the Southern end of
Block IX, which is the southernmost of the B.H. Proprie-
tary Co.’s three leases and adjoins Block 10, was first seen
by a party of watchmen. At hast the smoke was seen,
as a matter of fact, nobody has seen the fire; for,
notwithstanding the columns of high-flown news-
paper description, it is extremely doubtful if, at any
lime, it has done any more than smoulder. It
was the smoke which, finding no easy outlet, filled
the workings, and repulsed the men at IHe begin-
ning. Afterwards, of coins?, the workings had to he
kept closed in order to shut off currents of air. At the
most, it is doubtful if the lire more than charred a few
timbers. The general-manager does not believe a single
stick is burned, through; and Dr. Robertson shares the
opinion. And even then it burned in a part of the mine
which had been practically abandoned so far as sloping
was concerned—the "creepiest” section of the whole line.
Those who got their ideas of the fire from the
daily newspaper reports are to be sympathised with. One
imaginative writer likened the spectacle to a volcano in
active eruption. This, however, was the exact position :
a large and irregular excavation ; from cracks here and
there either smoke or steam issuing, but now here much
more than from the kitchen-chimney when the breakfast
fire is being lit ; a few men tearing down the sides of the
excavation, and throwing dirt over the cracks; a few
more holding hoses, allowing the water to fall into the
bottom of the quarry, whence it soaked into the mine.
Sometimes smoke and steam would almost entirely dis-
appear. Then the suectacle was no more exciting than
the falling of a stream of water out of a hose into a deep
hole.
Eight years ago, when the use of soft Oregon
timber for staging the Broken Hill mines was introduced
by Mr. Patton, many prophesied disaster. But it was
pointed out that with the rough timber the square-set
system would be impossible, and the obvious merits of
that system in a broad lode carried the day easily, lu
practice, too, the soft wood has been found to possess
many advantages. It gives slowly ; the hardwood
would snap. In a “creepy ” mine any sudden movement
of this kind could only end in disaster. Ten-inch blocks
of Oregon have been found compressed to less than half
that size. The real danger from fire began with the opeu-
cuttiug, which has exposed the upper timbers.
Suppose a fire gets hold of the sulphides ! They
will burn by themselves. A kiln of them would take
about four months to bum itself out.
Just before the tire there were 4070 men etn-
ployed tm the Broken Hill mines ; of these 2200 were iu
the B.H. Proprietary’s underground workings, smelters,
and mills, and 700 in the quarries. The Central employed
400; the South, 270; Block 14, 225; Block 10, 100;
British, 85. But Block 14 has its smelting plant at Port
Adelaide, and the B.H. Proprietary has six smelting
furnaces and a refinery at Port Pirie. The fire in Block
11 threw 1300 of the Proprietary’s men out, and caused a
loss of between £3OOO and £4OOO a week to the S.A. rail-
way revenue.
Some timorous Broken Hill shareholders Were
alarmed when they were told that American mines had
burned for nine years. But the cases are very different.
There the mines were from 1000 to 1500 ft. deep, worked
out almost from Ihe surface, and not closely mullocked
up. At Broken Hill few slopes are as yet below 350 ft.,
and most of the worked-out ground is filled up, not with
timber only, but with debris. For eight years either the
general-manager or the mine-engineer has been an
American, using American timber after American
methods; the first month after an American ceased to
hold either office this trouble arose. But, of course, it is
no more than coincidence.

Patterson deprecated this personal attack, and said that

When a diligent and honorable physician

Premier JReid, who has just been presented
with an expensive gold chronometer, to make up

lie will always wear a 12s. fid. article at future

Reid’s copious figure this is a prudent resolution.
G. Reid’s watch, when he carries it in his waist-
coat pocket, is situated at the remotest part of his
vast protuberance, and a thief might take it out
of the suburbs of his frame, as it were, and get
away with it long ere the rest of G. Reid could
overtake that part of him where the robbery was
being committed. When the Premier is in Pitt-

He died of suffocation, and was found with his

The new number of the Dictionary of

General Dodds is such a big gun that one
wonders what the devil he does in an Australian
galley. Well, The Bulletin hears that Fanre,
Ribot, et cie., are as much afraid of him as the
Directory was of Bonaparte when it sent him to
Egypt, in the devout hope that a pyramid, or
sphinx,' or something would crush him flat as a
pancake. The shuddery Boulanger is not yet
forgotten.
Cabled that, in a letter thanking the elec-
tors of South Down for the support accorded him,
Dr. Rowan (formerly of Melb.), the unsuccessful
Conservative candidate, attributes his defeat to
“ignorance, superstition, and illiterate brute

of high repute as a gynecologist. He 'was long
resident physician at Melb. women’s hospital, and
is the husband of a Vic. heiress.
Trenwith, M.L.A., now unhappily almost
blind, when he made bis great speech on the Yic.

local manufacture with which to illustrate certain

he picked up the wrong article and exhibited it,
until the guffaws of one of the Opposition mem-
bers drew attention to the mistake" A friend of
the blind politician afterwards took his critic
aside—by the ear.
Editor Drew, .of Geraklton (W.A.) Fx-

on his return home from the gaol into which he
was thrown as the consequence of a successful

by Govt, spite, for the Express is the keenest

rejoicings at Drew’s return bode ill for Six-Family

dinner there was so infernally bad that another
venue was selected. The catering at the Insti-
tute was at one time among the best in London.
Mr. H. Palmer Abbott,
who would probably get most
votes as champion N.S.W.
Rugby footballer, was born
at Brisbane (Q.) in ’72. He
started the game in ’B7 as
a member of the Grammar
School first fifteen ; and
afterwards became captain of
the school both in football
and cricket. He quickly took
a prominent place among the
best football players of the
northern capital, and in ’B9
he played as wing three-
quarter back for Queens-
land against the Maori and
N.S.W. teams. In ’9O he
came to Sydney, joined the
University team, and estab-
lished his reputation as one of
the best all-round players
that ever donned a guernsey
’tvvixt goals. His team won
the premierships in ’9O, ’9l,
and ’93; was second in ’92 ;
third in ’94; and is third on
the list for the current sea-
son. Abbott’s position in
these matches was always
centre three-quarter back.
He was elected captain in
’93, and has held that posi-
tion ever since. He played
with Queensland against
N.S.W., at Sydney, in ’9O ;
with N.S.W. against Queens-
land, at Brisbane,' in ’9l;
captained N.S.W. against
Maoriland in ’93 ; and cap-
tained N.S.W. against Cen-
tral Queensland on 6th inst.
Abbott prefers wing three-
quarter to any other position,
and thinks that “a lot of
attractiveness is taken out of
the game by the system of
wing-forwards now in vogue,
which is rapidly ridding the
game of hard-working for-
wards. The system,” says
the ’Varsity hero, “incites
forwards to loaf with a view of waiting an open-
ing for a bit of ‘ gallery-play.’ It also encourages
off-side and an unfair interference with an op-
posing team’s half-backs—faults that can only be
prevented by strict and arduous umpiring.”
A London correspondent :—“ Governor
Hampden is tolerably well off for a peer, bis
income being .£16,000 a year, so he will be able to
entertain well. Personally he is exceedingly
popular in his ‘ se t.’ ”
One promi-

Premier Kingston was born to trouble.
When high up the political ladder, he figured in a
hot and costly love-affair; then came the absurd
duel, in which Kingston at least showed manliness
doubtfully possessed by his latest enemy. The
S.A. Premier sometimes ascribes all his troubles
to the fact that a lawyer’s clerk once committed
suicide against the office-door of Kingston and
Hall, and stained the floor with blood. Since
then his luck has been out.
Despite his youthful appearance, Pid-
dington, M.L.A., who ousted G. Republican
Dibbs from T.amworth, is a great deal older than
his years. Since his earliest days Piddington has
sincerely believed himself to be a genius, which

ENOCH FLEECER (bookmaker) : “ That’s business; you can put me

naturally solemn. There is no joke by Piddington
recorded, nor is it even rumored that he ever
spoke otherwise than earnestly.
Selector: “I am sorry to hear of Tren-
with's partial blindne-s. He was once a member
of my lodge of Oddfellows—and when once you’ve
exchanged mystic grips and sinister passwords
with a man you feel to know him. He used to be
a sby, sensitive chap, but warm-hearted in spite
of his reserve ; unostentatious, and never vulgar.
I always thought him better fitted for the Leg.
Assembly than for a workshop.”
Musical professor Marshall Hall and
attorney Marshall Lyle are continually having
their names mixed in error. The other day, the

IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

Snell: “Talk about fame! A reliable
friend tells me there is a (comparatively) new-
chum staying at his hoarding-house in a Melb.
suburb, who, until the recent N.S.W. elections,
firmly believed that Parkea was The Bulletin a
‘Mrs. Harris.’ Hearing the old man’s defeat
discussed, he exclaimed : ‘Whatl you don’t mean
to tell me there is really such a person as Parkes !
J’ve been under the impression that he was a
humorous creation of that fellow ‘Hop,’ who
draws for The Bulletin. ’ lam not a new-churn
myself, but I am not certain that this young man
is wrong. Seriously, is there or was there ‘ any
sich a person ’ as Parkes?” [No, there isn’t and
there never was.—Ed. B.]
• Another Tyson
story, “ I was school-
mastering in a small Q.
township, at the tail-
end of the 80’s, when
the long millionaire
dropped in in his usual
promiscuous, forgot-
my-Ciird-oase style. I
was just then rounding
up all the people who
had a spare pound for
subscriptions to the
school-fund, and I
thought Mr. Tyson a
most likely mark. So
I interviewed him. I
said, ‘Good day, Mr.
Tyson. I’m the school-
master here, and I’m
trying to collect the
local fifth part required
by Government belore
it Will call tenders for
the improvements ne-
cessary for the school.
Will you give us some
help ?’ ‘ What are the
improvements going
to be ?’ he asked. ‘ A
play-shed, a bell, and
a fence,’ I replied.
‘ Ha, ha,’—and it was
a horribly sari astic ha,
ha —‘a play-shed, eh?
You wanta play-shed,
indeed J Do you think
it p, proper thing to
accustom our young
Queenslanders, our
future carpenter-, bi.il-
lock-drlversj, shearers,
damainkers and theii
wives to be unfit for
work when the sun is
too hot or the weather
a bit wet? Nonsense!
And a bell,’ he con-
tinued, indignantly,
‘ what rubbish ! Set
them up with a bell!
What for? To have
them at school in
time? Haven’t they
got tiie laughing jack-
asses to waken them
up every morning as
they have me for many a day? Why not
give them valets or lady’s-maids and alarm-clocks;
Children ought to be taught the value of punctu-
ality in such a way that, bell or ho bell, they would
be there from a sense of duty, not only to others
but to themselves. Now, the fence is the only
really sensible thing of the lot. It will teach them
the rights of property and the illegality of trespass.
I will give you this (.£5) for the fence, and just
put it down from a friend—l don’t want my name
to appear. Good day.” The Bulletin believes
most of tliis story, which is characteristically
Tysbnian. The old man’s fetish is self-reliance;
also, when he gives away money, which he does
in plenty, you don’t read about it in the papers.
When G. Republican Dibbs was journey-
ing per night-train to Tam worth and the elections,
he discovered that his was a top berth in the
sleeping-car. Much troubled, he asked the con-
ductor to try and arrange wit h some gentleman to
change berths. A gentleman did oblige. “ Who
has been so kind?” asked the knight of many
damns. “ A Daily Telegraph reporter,” replied
the conductor. “First d thing the Tele-
graph ever did for the country,” exclaimed Dam
Chicago.
Albert Calvert, mining-promoter, de-
scribed as “the eminent Australian explorer” (!!!)
was banqueted at the Imperial Institute (to what
base uses !) the other day, and from pictures in
the Daily Graphic and New Budget, the Lon-
don correspondent of S.A, Advertiser gathers
that “the service of plate presented to the unspeak-
ably modest person aforesaid was of an excep-
tionally sumptuous and solid character. But
why, oil why, are the teapot and coffeepot, not to
mention the tray, surmounted by models of an
obese and long-necked goose ? Is the noble bird
intended to be typical of the promoter of, or the
investor in, Westralian mines, or was some subtle
compliment to Albert Calvert, M.1.C.E., in the
subscribers’minds ? On second thoughts, I have
come to the conclusion that the aforesaid bird
must be a swan and not a goose. The larger and
less savoury fowl figures, I believe, in the Westra-
lian coat-of-arma. ”

A MELB. SMOKE-NIGHT IMPRESSION.
An accomplished artist : " We are na fou!”
It is freely asserted in Melb. that the
bookies are lavishing their oish to bring members
44 to reason ” on the Tote Bill.
44 At a previous time, when this House
was not so disgracefully moral as it is now.”—
Frank Lawry, M.H.R., of Maoriland.
N.S. W. elections threaten to end with the
benediction. Dan O’Connor has been God-bless-
ing the electors who again rejected him.
“ The talk of the lips tendeth to penury.”
Modern and Australian version : Politics means
two things - Drunkenness and Insolvency.
Of the three parsons who stood at N.S.W.
general election, only one was returned. But
what on earth possessed Granville to again return
the weird and dismal "Smailes?
The Loud on
Statist, it is
cabled, is quite
sure that the
S.A, State Land
Bank 4 4 will lead
to much mis-
chief.” What mis-
chief it will lead
to, or how it will
lead to it, doesn’t
appear; neither
is if shown that
the- Statist
knows how the
Land Bank is to
be worked, or
what are the con-
ditions of the
country, or any-
thing else about
the flatter. More-
over; as England
d o e‘s n’ t own
either State or
private Land
Banks, the aver-
age j Englishman
knows as little
about the subject
as a Queenslander
knows about ice-
bergs. Further,
the Statist
hasn’t any great
reputation for
knowing much
about anything.
Nobody will
resign to let the
defeated Dibbs
into N.S. W; As-
sembly. Nobody
will resign in
favor of the de-
feated Parkes.
Resignation now
means something
tangible. The
man who, in these
hard times, re-
signed .£3OO a
year for his
party’s sake,
would, in tlo-
long run, find
himself sculp-
tured in marble
as ? 44 The Mar-
tyr ” and set up
opposite Parlia-
ment Houses.
Query ; Who is Mr. Deas-Thomson, and
why should he be appointed to N.S.W. Leg.
Council ? The Bulletin has heard of the original
Deas-Thomson ; but is the Leg. Council an heredi-
tary Chamber ?
More J.P.-isra. It appears that the other
day a police-opposed application for a hotel-license
was granted by a northern N.S.W. bench by two
votes to one—one of the two magistrates con-
stituting the majority being the father of the
applicant!
Parkes’s fierce charge against Reid of
44 interfering with the liberties of the people,”
brings to memory the shameful enactments pro-
posed (or supported) by the Grand Old Mendacity,
after lunatic O’Farrell’s shooting at Alfred of
Edinburgh.
Whispered that the Separation feeling in
Central and Northern Queensland will be tested
at next election by each elector receiving a ballot-
paper with the question 44 Are you in favor of
Separation-Yes or No?” The Referendum to
the front again.
The old law which required members of
N.S.W. Leg. Council to be sworn at the com-
mencement of each new Parliament was a most
salutary one. Were it in existence now, at least
four who hold the 44 honor ” and 44 the pass ” would
be officially effaced.
To appoint ex-Treasurer See as the leader
of the N.S.W. Parliamentary Protectionist party
would be ridiculous. Mr. See is respectable, but
he is dull and snapless as a canned oyster. When
choosing between the Devil and the Deep Sea,
always select the Devil.
The late N.S.W. elections were held to
decide 44 the clear-cut issue of Upper House
reform.” And now the Beer interest and the
cold-tea saints are busily engaged in proving
that the only issue ever thought of by the electors
was Bung versus Lemonade.
Under the current estimates, the total
expenditure on Vic. Parliamentary Library for
the year is to be .£2237, of which only .£450 goes
for the purchase and binding of books. The
salaries of the librarian and his assistants amount
to <£1787. The librarian at Melb. Public Library
gets £419 a year, and has a colossal and con-
stantly-growing collection of books to look after.
The Parliamentary Librarian gets .£546 a year,
and has practically nothing to do during half the
year.
Sydney D.T. berates the S.A, voter
generally because he 44 has not realised the dif-
ference between the importation of Asiatic goods
and the importation of the races who produce
them;” and then weaves wonderful bosh which
ends in asserting that, when the S.A. voter gets
wisdom, 44 he will not be found in opposition to
trade-reciprocity proposals.” Implying that the
Ereetrade D.T. itself is in favor of reciprocity.
Very queer. For a Freetrader is bound to be 44 in
opposition to trade-reciprocity proposals,” because
—(1) they break the nose of his economic god ; and
(2), even if he wants to reciprocate, he has noth-
ing whatsoever with which to reciprocate— i.e., if
he is honest and 44 makes it ” Ereetrade.
On the Vic. railways, despite the great fall
in revenue, the working expenses have been
reduced, since the close of the Speight era, from
70 to 59 per cent, of the receipts ; the actual cost
of running trains has been reduced from 3s. 9d. to
3s. 2d. per mile, and the cost of the railway work-
shops has been cut down almost one-half. The Age
was mainly responsible for the ejection of Speight
and Allison Smith, and these figures were" the
main reason why Speight and Smith’s libel-actions
against that paper came to so melancholy an end.
Money is so scarce in Melbourne just now that a
jury feels that almost any kind of language i-
justifiable when directed against men of larg-
spending capacity.

HIS REVERENCE : “I can't take your cab, Pat. I see your horse has been

PAT: “Arrah! yer Riverince, be aisy about that. The last place he had

religion.”
As illustrating the muddle-headedness of
the anti-Ministerialists in Bananaland Parliament;
Powers is introducing one Electoral Reform Bill,
Glassey another, and Hardacre is rumored to have
a bantling of his own in the background.
The best-abused man in Anglo-colonial
circles just now is Mr. G. H. Reid, writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent. 44 George
Dibbs and Protection ” used to be the bogey, but
now it is the other way about. Ji.s.d. again. The
teuderest point of an absentee is his pocket.
Is J. R. Carey, Sydney D.T. chairman,
really to be one of Reid’s M.L.C.’s ? If so, the
House of Kidney-fits will be brightened by the
presence of a real all-wool democrat. Mr. Carey
is also chairman of Sydney ’Bus Go., whose
drivers sing his praises from early morn unto
11 p.m.
N.S.W. Assembly will again pass the land-
tax and income-tax, and the Council, it is stated,
will again throw out the land-tax—on the alleged
ground that any exemption is unjust. It may
also throw out the income-tax, alleging that the
exemption is fixed too high. Then Premier Reid
will stalk off to England to arrange in that sodden
land for an alteration in the Constitution.

THE COMPARATIVE MOOD.
SNOOZER : " This beer is bad—very bad.”
BOOZER : “No sunk — hie! —thing as bad beer. There's good beer and
better beer.”
London Times regrets —and the faithful
“cable” re-echoes its regrets:—“ that -Premier
Reid’s majority is not sufficient to enable him to
lispeuse with the support of the Labor-party.”
Many people rejoice that the Labor-party’s posi-
tion is strong enough to enable it to dispense with
the support of the Times.
Many N.S. W. employers are starting to
discharge men by scores, and some by hundreds.
This, no doubt, partly owing to the immediate
prospect of their business being rendered unre-
mnnerative by the alteration in the tariff ; but
partly (in at least some cases) as the result of
a National Ass. conspiracy.
Public opinion will not be satisfied by the
release of the surviving Mount Rennie boys.
Justice, however tardy, must be dealt out in the
matter of their trial. That the public may be
fully informed as to the nature of that hideous
farce, the admirable series of articles in the Aus-
tralian Star should be republished in pamphlet
form.
a Bill legalising marriage with a deceased
husband’s brother has passed the Maoriland House
of Representatives. It went by a large majority,
but with an utter absence of enthusiasm. Plenty
of politicians feel like marrying a deceased wife’s
sister —especially her younger sister, but a de-
ceased husband’s brother Bill is not a person to
enthuse about.
The latest. Working men in Walgett
(N.S. W.) district, writes a Bulletin correspon-
dent, are now told that if known to possess
electors’ rights they will get no shearing or other
employment locally if the managers or big dum-
mies can prevent it. The idea being that as
under the secret-voting system one never can
be sure how a man will go, it’s best to make
certain by knowing that he doesn’t vote at all.
One or two of Q. Labor-leader Glassey’s
speeches on his return from America gave hope
that he was getting sense ; but the hope was soon
damped again. But for the accident of being first
in the field, Glassey would never be even thought
of as leader. He is honest enough ; but vain,
intemperate, injudicious, and intolerably long-
winded. His errors this session are more flagrant
than ever. Either Reid or Dawson would make a
much better commander.
“If,” writes Anarchist Andrews to] The
Bulletin, “Government honestly wishes to re-
move some of the obstacles placed during the past
century in the way of the people’s prosperity and
independence, why not facilitate the task of those
who wish to go upon the soil and draw their
subsistence therefrom ? We have a system of
4 miners’ rights,’ the working of which is well-
understood ; why not declare the remaining lands
inalienable, and issue land-occupation rights in
respect of them on a similar basis —shortly stated,
4 title to occupy for personal use, existing and
ceasing with such bona-fide use ’ —which would be
an incalculable boon to many and a hard knock to
the sharks?”
A would-be candidate, interviewed a well-
known light of the Sydney boxing-ring and told
him he would give him ss. each for 50 signatures
of voters in a certain city electorate to a requisi-
tion asking him to stand for Parliament. 44 It’s a
bit out of my line,” said the apotheosized pug. —
“you’d better go to Soandso, who will fix it for
you.” Soandso agreed to 44 fix it,” and produced
the needed signatures within 24 hours. He had
simply gone down to Devonshire-street cemetery
and taken 50 names off the gravestones. 44 I
really hope,” said the candidate while writing out
the promised cheque,” that, these men are all
right and will really support me.” “Nothing’s
absolutely sure in this world,” replied Mr. So-
andso, 44 but I think I may venture to bet that not
one oi them will work against you.”
A former representative of a Sydney con
stituency, now elected for a N.S.W. Norther*
district; 44 1 will never again stand for a seat
near home. My house was never free from in-
trusion, and every butcher and baker and candle-
stick-maker demanded my custom with, as it were,
political menaces.”
For a temporary messengership in Maori-
land Parliament buildings during session, there
were 130 applications in two days. The State
will never be debarred from extending its business
through lack of persons willing to enter its service
At present, mainly because of party government,
the business extends but slowly, and the greatest
enemy of a political party is the necessity for
supporting its own support - >-
Premier King-
ston calls his State
Advances measure
“ The Shylock Exter-
minator Act.”
The English
“Liberals,” the
Lowes, Oobdens,
Brights, Gladstones,
Harcourts, never
wanted Democracy.
The Tories were
ready to dabble in it
long ago, when Pal-
merston restrained
the Derby before last
from leaping in the
dark. The Tory -
Democrats look to
countries like Russia
and Spain, where
Monarchism could
not exist for a day
but for the devotion
of the masses. The
people want what is
tangible their old
Roman bread and
circuses. The Ger-
mans only crave, just
now, a Socialist Em-
pire. Democracy can
retain the old Tory
forms, but eat out
the insideofits enemy
—just as the white
ants eat the legs of
tables, all but the
outside shell. The
Monarchy is being
eaten by the ants ; by
and bye the nation
will take in its grip
those beautifully
turned and glitter-
ingly-varnished but
rotten table-legs.
Cr-r-uneh ! and a
mere cloud of dust.
The Tories see the
danger, but also that
they must risk their
only game. The Tory
card should now be
one - man-one- vote
even one - adult • one -
vote.
“The Queen’s Own” and “The Pope’s
Own” two antagonistic civil service secret
societies^ —have collided down South. In keep-
ing with tradition, anonymous threatening letters
have been flying round. Both societies are
influential in their own tin-pot way—an ex-
Premier and prominent politicians being members
of one or the other.
He had two scrutineers (paid by himself(
at the booth, and they were both electors; also,
they both swore to vote for him, their generous
patron. But when the poll was declared the
candidate found that not a single vote had been
cast for him at that booth, and that no vote was
recorded as informal. Each scrutineer had
decided to “sell” his employer, and each had
reckoned on the other not being such a thief as
himself. It was as good as a play.
Important Questions to the Public.
“Are you subject to indigestion, pain in the
stomach, flatulency and headache ? ”
If so, take Warner’s Safe Cure, which never
fails to promptly relieve these symptoms.
“ Do you have pains in the right side, or under
shoulder blade, a bitter, oily taste in the mouth, a
furred tongue ; specks before the_ eyes; suffer
from giddiness, nausea and drowsiness?” Sure
signs that the liver is inactive.
Then use Warner’s Safe Cure, which is a power-
ful liver invigorator, and sure cure for these ail-
ments.
“Are you subject to rheumatic pains, and swel-
lings of the joints ? ” An acknowledged result of
impurity of the blood.
Then resort to Warner’s Safe Cure, the only
reliable remedy, as experienced by thousands in
all countries.
“ Is your breathing laboured, have you lost the
florid colour, your appetite, flesh and strength ?
Do you suffer from palpitation of the heart ? Are
you wakeful at night and drowsy during the day ?
Do your ankles or limbs swell ? Is your eye-sight
failing ? Is there an occasional dull, heavy pain
over the loins, and deposits in the urine? ”
If so, the kidneys—these important organs—are
complaining. No time should be lost. Procure
and take Warner’s Safe Cure. A remedy which
never fails in these diseases, as proved by the
testimony of thousands.

There are two distinct stories of the King-
ston-Sparks encounter told in Adelaide. The
democrats have it that Sparks came quietly up to
Premier Kingston and set about him from the
rear, whereas Fat Man represents the aggressor
as a chivalrous land-grabber who would scorn to
win first blood on a foul. The Bulletin puts
very little faith in the fair-play of a man who goes
forth in cold blood to horsewhip somebody who
has spoken slightingly of him. As a rule, the
revengeful person makes up his mind to
1 administer a sound thrashing ” in the easiest
possible way, without risking the conse-
quences of a preliminary announcement. Sheriff
Boothby, who was with Kingston when the
latter was assaulted by Sparks, was utterly
unequal to the occasion, and a narrative of the
little scrimmage published in America would
cause disgust in the breast of every citizen.
Boothby’s duty was to draw his revolver, fire at
Sparks and hit Kingston, and then shoot care-
lessly at the whole crowd, muttering between his
clenched teeth : “ How now, Woolloomooloo
Jack ! I’ve struck your tracks at last!” A great
occasion lost.

Rumored that Victoria’s coming Governor
has stated in private letters that he intends to put
his foot down on indiscriminate entertainment,
such as has hitherto been the rule at Govt. House.
Two “ state ” balls a year, closely resembling such
functions at Buckingham Palace, and to be taken
quite as seriously and with as much preliminary
prayer and fasting, is all Melbournites, not abso-
lutely within the charmed circle, may look forward
to during the Brassey regime.

“ Lord and Lady Darley,” says S.M.

Four parsons officiated at the funeral of

Sec her tripping ’cross the street—
Swagger stockings, tiny feet !
Well she knows her ankles neat,
Or she wouldn’t show ’em !
But her sister —she whose shoes
Quaintly flop, like small caimes !
Watch her try, by cunning ruse,
Skirts to keep below ’em !
Thus it was since Time began,
Since Eve came to solace man.
Since, when nymphs for Paris ran,
Male things stood to con ’em.
Surely in those halcyon days,
Ere girls took to wearing stays,
Figures were beyond all praise,
Or—they’d had more on ’em !
M,HS.
the other day. How they do topple over each
other in their anxiety to officiate at the funeral
of a pauper pietist!
* • •
The Hopetouns, no doubt, will be really
grieved at the death of Mr. Tom Manifold, He
and all his clan were prime favorites with the
Countess, who singled out the younger branches
as the only local juveniles worthy to share in the
sports of “ Lord Hope, if you please.” Her lady-
ship’s last gift to the little Manifolds was the his-
toric goat-team and shay, which was to have gone
home with the original owners, had they not dis-
covered, at the last moment, that “William” and
mate would be slaughtered on board ship, and not
allowed to set foot on British soil. Whereupon
they were packed off to Camperdown.

Actang-Gov. Madden was on exhibition at
a recent Melb. Salvation Army fandango, and
delivered himself of the depressingly dignified
speech that has become habitual with him since
Ids elevation. He also asserted that he had been
in receipt of two letters from persons who
besought him not to degrade his gorgeous and
almost Royal condition by attending Salvation
Army demonstrations, and lending his glittering
countenance to the big drum and its blatant asso-
ciates—vulgar persons who disseminate the Gospel
in back lanes. His Vice-Excellency took his cor-
respondents very seriously, and was at great pains
to point out that his conduct even at a Salvation
razzle was carefully controlled so as not to com-
promise Her Gracious in any way. This is true.
Chief Justice Madden, in his gubernatorial
capacity, patronises the theatre regularly, and is
so extremely careful of the vice-regal dignity that
he never goes out for a drink between the acts,
but sits simmering through the long waits, with
the burden of his unwonted magnificence heavy
upon him, staring blankly at the curtain with
eyes that never deviate, and with self-conscious-
ness oozing from every pore of his carefully
cosmetiqued person. Dignity is Madden’s strong
point—he is clothed with it as with a boiler-iron
night-shirt.
• * *
Victoria is suffering from aggravated hero-
worship. Acting-Gov. Madden writes letter after
letter of fulsome adulation to men whose heroism
consisted in doing brave deeds as though all in the
day’s work. The effect will be that at the next
mining accident men will be hesitating whether it
wouldn’t be better to die with their mates than
live to receive such pumped-up epistles.
# m m
That divorce-case, perhaps more talked-
about and written-about than any other for 20
years, remains in abeyance through the advice
of the lawyers, who hold outno hope of the con-
summation desired by both parties.
• * #
At a Melb. branch-meeting of the A.N. A.,
last week, an illuminated Certificate was presented
to Justice Williams with the hope that “ the time
was not far distant when the Association would
be able to congratulate his Honor upon his eleva-
ting to the highest judicial position in the colony.”
Either a wild utterance, or an inspired hint that
the gorgeous Madden expects to represent Vic-
toria, or Australia, on the Judicial Committee
of the P.C. in London. Or, if neither of these
things, it, was intended as a suggestion that
Madden would oblige the A.N.A. by sending
in his resignation at an early date. They can’t
be looking forward to his sudden decease. In the
first place, Chief Justice M. is a very healthy
potentate, bred to stay, and in the second place
nobody would like the world to lose him in his
waxed and golden prime. He is much too amusing
for that.
* ♦ m
So desperate are things, getting in Bris-
bane, that single chappies, of the bank-clerk
brigade, are taking lessons at the Technical Col-
lege in tailoring and trouser-making.
• # #
The burning question of the place where
Gov. Brassey is to land, and the road by which he
shall enter Melb., is still unsettled ; it has proved
too weighty for Acting-Gov. Madden, who has
passed it along to the Cabinet. The seaside
suburbs have displayed so much feeling upon the
momentous point that it lias been suggested the
Sunbeam should come to anchor somewhere in the
Gippsland lake-i —whence Brassey could proceed
to Melb. by rail. But, in that case, civil war is
to be feared between the rival towns of Bairnsdale
and Sale. On the whole, it might be best in the
interests of peace were Brassey to land somewhere
outside Victoria and walk to the nearest railway-
station. No such interest about a distinguished
arrival’s landing and route has arisen since they
brought Deeming along from Westralia.
• * #
If Gov. Brassey lands at St. Kilda he
ought to skip one street. It was a busy thorough-
fare once, but now all that is left is two sides of
empty shops, their plate-glass windows inch deep
IS MARRIAGE A FAILURE?
MAUD: “ But marrying an officer, on the mail-boat, why you will only see your
husband once in three months.”
ETHEL: “ Well, isn’t that the chief advantage? Fancy the delight of a honey-
moon and a dicorce four times a year! ”
with old posters. A magnificent hall of commerce—
the spec, of a bygone boomer—commands one side,
having one of its windows let to a marine-store
dealer, who strews rusty flat-irons and cracked
kettles and leaky hose along the pavement.
Opposite is a hairdresser’s wherte Deeming—whom
the proprietor remembers—once had his hair cut,
and lower down is the ironmonger’s where he pur-
chased the tools and cement. These alone thrive,
but are clearly reserved for the tail-end of the
curse which has blighted the neighborhood.

The other day quite a pretty little woman,
with a plump face and fuzzy hair, promenaded
the main walk of Brisbane Botanic Gardens in a
really nobby pair of rough serge bloomers. Mem-
bers on their way up to the House stopped to gaze
in paralytic astonishment at the seductive waggle
of a shapely pair of calves, such as even a dancer
might envy. Luckily for the business-paper of
the Council, after about half-an-hour she got into
a cab and drove home.

Bucolic Kanakaland M.P., welcoming
Gov. Norman to open the local “show ” the other
day: “In short, in the long line of Governors,
there’s not one as liever did as much for the
colony, not one as—as —as was hever so much
beloved—not one as Was hever—hever—a—a patch
on Sir Hantiny Musgrave.” (Smothered laughter
and cheers from crowd.) The Governor turned it
off nicely : “My eloquent friend made an obvious
slip, but, after all, perhaps the eulogy of my pre-
decessor was not misplaced. Sir Anthony had
done as much for the country, was as well-
liked ” “ Not ’im !” interrupted the enthu-
siastic legislator. “Good fellow in his way, but
not a patch upon this exhibit, eh, Sir ’Enry?”
(slapping him familiarly on the back). “We love
you, my boy. Three cheers for Sir Hantiny ’Enery
Wylie ! ” Then the crowd rolled on the ground in
ecstasy.

The most conspicuously be-diamonded
people at the conversazione of the Royal Colonial
Institute the other evening, writes The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent, were the Victorian
contingent. Mrs. Rupert Clarke had a show
worthy of a Bond-street jeweller ; Mrs. Everard
Browne’s brilliants were the cynosure of neigh-
boring eyes ; Mrs. Cruickshank’s ornaments were
a perfect blaze, and another lady, the spouse of a
racing and mining man, was also resplendent.
These were the most conspicuous, but others, per-
sonally unknown to me, carried enough wealth
about them to occasion the remark that things
cannot be so very bad in some Australian circles.

Gaiety-Girl attractions, according to one
parson, consist chiefly in “ unsavory jokes and
liberal displays of anatomy ” —which is a lot truer
than his corollary that “a tide of nastiness is
swamping our national life.” Savoring of the
unsavory is an older institution than the parson,
and is no more likely to pre-decease him than to
culminate in that universal lubricity predicted by
the man with the long upper-lip every time he
gives to an “objectionable print’’ the minute
scrutiny which it receives from nobody else except
the more frankly prurient person against whom
he is continually taking up his parable. Man-
kind is no “nastier,” here and now, than it has
been always and everywhere.
* * *
Mr.. Gilchrist, the Sydney man recently
released from a Westralian prison, after doing
three months of an latterly undeserved three years’
sentence for alleged -“obtaining,” was directly
assumed to be guHty because temporarily unable
to prove his innocence. And it’s so, nearly every
time, despite the hoary lie to the contrary. Let
British “ fai-r-play ” once get you into the dock,
and you’re pretty certain to get the boasted
“ benefit of the doubt ” —against you !
Dear Bulletin, —lie that famous law of
Strzelecki quoted the other day. Strzeleoki asserts
that “aboriginal women, after intercourse with
Europeans, lose the power of conception on a
renew d of intercourse with males of their own
race.” The which so-called law is pure, unadul-
terated bunkum, and its complete disproof can
be seen any day in any aboriginal camp in
Central and Northern Queensland. I have con
versed with scores of men who know the blacks
well, and they all receive Strzelecki’s law with a
burst of laughter. Had Strzeleoki said the half
caste progeny are much more numerous than the
aboriginal, one could cordially agree with him.—

Various parties haggled over this document
in the law courts, and by the time they had
done haggling, and the Full Court had finally
upset the decision of the inferior court, there was
no estate left. All Thomas’s accumulations have
been swallowed up by the lawyers. Thomas spent
over 40 years in building up his little pile, and the
legal fraternity dissipated it all in just about 40
days. It is a very big estate indeed that can
stand the expense of an enquiry ,to find out who it
belongs to. An ordinary property disappears
under such circumstances like a pound of sugar

Here are some actually existing relation-
ships completed by two Tasmanian families—the
names are false, but the exact state of relationship
is as here set down. Also, each separately new
family has now a nursery attached, and if the
progeny intermarry with any like recklessness or
ingenuity, what sort of a maze of consanguinity
will be developed ? Imagine, first, two families
named (say) Cox. Also, imagine another family
named (say) Box. The Coxes with whom we
have to cfo are (say) John and Julia, first cousins,
These marry. The Boxes with whom we have to
do are three brothers (say), William, Robert and
James. Of these, James has married altogether
outside of this calculation, and actually had a
grown-up son, James, jun., before the problem was
hatched. Well, John Cox married his cousin, Julia
Cox, Julia thus never changing her name. Then
William Box married John’s sister, Emily
Cox. Whereupon Robert Box married one of
Julia Cox’s sisters, Edith Cox ; and James Box,
junior, married another of Julia Cox’s sisters,
Caroline Cox. So : John Cox is husband and
cousin to Julia; brother-in-law, in two different
ways, to both William and Robert Box ; brother-
in-law to his own sister, Mrs. William Box;
brother-in-law to Mrs. Robert Box ; brother-in-law
and unole-in law to Mr. and Mrs. James Box;
and, as he is the brother-in-law of his own nephew-
he is evidently his own nephew. Similarly,

The Late D. HUXTABLE.
A small Vic. boy, convicted of attempted
arson the other day, when asked why he tried to
burn down a neighbor’s cottage replied, “Oh!
you can get cheap firewood for your mother.”
That is the sort of boy who will drift into politics,
and want to build .£700,000 State railways for the
purpose of improving the value of his 40-acre block
away out-back.
Scandal even in a deaf and dumb asylum !
The officials of the local institution in Melbourne,
and many professional pietists connected there-
with, have been consternated by reports of giddi-
ness amongst the inmates. Male deaf mutes, it
appears, have been secretly visiting the female
quarters :
The proposal to locate Melbourne’s new
cemetery at the pretty village of Frankston, 27
miles from the city, is being violently opposed on
the ground that its location “would be incon-
venient to people desirous of visiting the graves
of friends or relatives.” The present writer would
suggest, in a tentative sort of fashion, that this
might be one of the best points about the arrange-
ment. Most of the people who pervade ceme-
teries don’t go to visit the graves of their own
friends, but merely wander among the tombs out
of a ghoulish love of mounds and epitaphs, and
to spell out other people’s inscriptions ; and these
morbid individuals require discouragement. There
are so many of them that when the real mourner
goes to visit his lost relative’s resting-place he has
often to wait until some complete stranger has
done with it. How bad this tendency towards
graves is in some people was shown in the evid-
ence at a Dunedin (M.L.) divorce-trial a few years
ago. “We were married,” said the plaintiff, a
girl-wife of 22 years, “on the 28th June. It was
a cold day and raining heavily. After the mar-
riage we went for a walk in the cemetery.” Ever
since then The Bulletin has been of opinion that
a cemetery should be as inaccessible as possible,
so that no ghoul can take his bride there on a wet
day to catch a lifelong snuffle among the ghosts
and wormy things, and to get rheumatism in the
cold draught that blows round the marble slab of
John Jones.

* One of the managers of a Melb. refuge
recently wrote to the papers acknowledging
various gifts which, he said, enable his proteges to
“lie down with at least the comfort of a full belly
to keep company with a sad heart.” A neat bit
of honest old Saxon, the like of which one rarely
meets nowadays.

In Samoa there lives a haughty potentate
who periodically sends away his elder boys for a
week to live—wash, cook and make their own
beds—in the stable at the end of the family five-
acre allotment. The boys’ bedroom there is right
over the horse and cow stalls, and looks down upon
the pig-sty and the fowl-roost. At the week’s
end the banished youths receive from their parents
a formal invitation to dine. They formally
accept. Then, arrayed in evening-dress, they
come down the ladder from their room, pick their
way out of the stable, past the pig-sty and the
hen-roost, and over to the house of their host and
hostess. Formal greetings are exchanged, and a
formal dinner is solemnly gone through. “ What’s
the object of all this d d fooling ? ” once asked
a fellow Samoan. “Aw,” replied the exiled
potentate, “it is necessary to keep one’s sons
thoroughly in touch with the formalities of polite
society. We hope one day to be able to—aw —
leave this beastly country.”

Up to a month or two ago the Melb. up-
holsterers used to gee old hair teased at the
Emigrants’ Home and the Benevolent Asylum at
a cost of 2d. per lb. Lately, however, the gaols
have reduced the charge to l|d., and at the pre-
sent time command a monopoly, while a few
dozen decent old men and women are thrown into
the streets simply because the semi-oharitable in-
stitutions can’t afford to keep them doing nothing.

and an icy wind blowing, and all was desolation
and slush, a picturesque procession went along a

main Melb. street. There was a cheap little
hearse first of all, with two black, bony horses
plodding along towards the cemetery. Next
there came one mourning-coach—empty. Then
came the rest of the show—one cab with a well-
known fat politician crumpled up in the corner
and fast asleep. His immense head hung one way
and his hat another, and his two huge, pendulous
knees shook like jelly with the motion of the
vehicle. His mouth was open, and a fatuous smile
covered his countenance. The crowd on a passing
tram-car caught sight of him and raised a wild
“boo-hoo,” but the blubbery mass only fell to-
gether a little and bobbed its hat dismally at the
crowd. And as the cab went by, the crowd on
the car could hear issuing from it a nasal sound
like “ gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r r-r-rmph ! ”

During ’94, 956,840 “franked” letters
were posted in Tasmania. The rottenness of the
system was revealed lately in the course of some
correspondence between the warden of a country
municipality and the Treasurer. Recently, too,
a large package containing washing or drapery
lay in Hobart P. 0., in full sight of the public. It
was addressed to a country lady, and franked by
an hon. M.H. A, Funny stories are told of the
abuses of the privilege, such as invitations for a
party being sent post-franked whilst the M.P.
whose stamp was on the letters was touring
across the Straits. Some members, too, effect a
great saving in telegrams by using the wires gratis
in their private business.

At Slowbart recently, a defending solicitor
was questioning a publican, witness for the pro-
secution. “You drink, don’t you? Were
you ever out of your mind through drink?
Then he struck a snag. “When did you have a
drink last?” The answer came pat: “At two
o’clock this morning with you in the
Hotel.” Cross-examination concluded.

The newest thing to be seen in Melbourne
streets is a very smart “ dog-cart ” driven by an
exceedingly massive blonde German lady, whose
driving costume consists of a long, bright-green
Melton coat with two rows of “penny” buttons
down the front, and a three-quarter bell-topper of
same shade of green, with a bright scarlet wing at
the side. Running through the front of the bodice
of this showy “rig-out” is a colossal gold dagger,
topped off with opals and diamonds.
Two Northern undertakers, who lately
took expensive lessons in the art of embalming,
proceeded to practise their new accomplishment,
on a nigger’s corpse. It was agreed that the
coffin should be stacked away for a certain number
of days, when the embalmers were to be present
and open the casket to see how the poor clay was
keeping. But, urged by curiosity, one of the
ghouls repaired alone to investigate on his own
account before the day fixed. He opened the
coffin to gaze upon the subject, and, “ horrible,
horrible and most horrible,” the defunct nig. ex.
ploded —in the interests of Cremation.

Mrs. Paxton, who died at Glebe Point,
Sydney, last week, during an operation, was the
only daughter of the late Joseph Paxton, of Hill
End mining fame. The deceased, a most charm-

wife of a popular and influential clergyman, whose
name she dropped after their divorce (at her suit).

During a recent municipal election in a
Melb. suburb, one of the candidates (a mighty big
swell) was vainly importuning the land!ady"of a
small hotel to vote for him. Her objection was
that she had no one to relieve her at the bar. The
difficulty was solved by the candidate uncoating
and going behind the bar himself, while the
liberated landlady went along to record her vote
for her pro. tern, barman (or one of the other
fellows).
DREAMS OF BEAUTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When day is gone, and ere the veil of twilight
Has fall’n on earth awhile,
I see her in the sunset’s crimson glory—
A ripe and joyous smile.
Upon the trembling wavelets dance the moonbeams
In throbbing cadence sweet;
And white upon the shimmering waters twinkle
j. . Her silver-bangled feet.
The shrill-toned creatures of the darkness falter,
To listen in delight
Her song of love, vibrating through the whispers
Of never-silent night.
When through the creeping grayness of the dawn-
ing
The reddened daybreak shows,
Upon the limits of the land of morning
Her passioned presence glows.
Dawn passes; blatant day glares unrelenting ;
The sensuous vision dies :
Yet in the deep-blue dome of Heaven lingers
The memory of her eyes.

He had no burning words to tell
The fervor of his flame, poor lad ;
And she—which proves it’s just as well—
Could not have heard them if he had.
Not for her ear the liquid lute,
No serenade could win him grace ;
They both were deaf and both were mute,
And yet, ’tis hinted, he must face
A rousing breaoh-of-promise case !

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,

My Dkab Moorabinda—
With a good floor and gallery attendance, and
dashing decoration, Tempo ball was really a great
success this time. Hut I wonder when ball-com-
mittees will learn that the spikey jama is not a
desirable adjunct, unless placed lift, above high-
dancing mark. To trim your pillars low down
with this dagger-edged plant threatens all sorts of
mishaps, from a gouged eye to a torn petticoat—
yet decoration-committees invariably include it in
their beautifying schemes. The dais and cosy
corners were handsomely upholstered—the supper
arrangements (cafe style) were a triumph, and the
decorations of wattle-blossom pretty enough to
excuse a lot of the bad “ puitry ” which is heaved at
this bilious, indigenous shrub. The music was
fairly good, the waltz-tempo suiting the Gaiety
style of ballroom dancing, which suggests the
gyrations of a sheet of newspaper in a brickfielder
rather than the dreamy style of rotating. Sydney
girls do not exactly crave to have the nicely-
tailored and haw-haw G. G. actors as waltz-
partners—they haven’t foot enough for these
johnnies. A “waltz” with a Gaiety “boy” is a
frantic rush down the room—a pause of four bars
while the inexperienced lady gets her wind—then
up the room, and repeat. It looks like the way
they train horses for a fire-engine.
Talking of dancing, as gallery crowds are a
fixed institution now at public balls, people will
have to be more careful how they trip it. To look
down upon a square dance and see some of the
performers “balancez” while others “chassez”
hardly looks as if the Sydney hop-and-skip pro-
fessors had reason to be proud of their pupils.
The Tempe ball was a very “ society ” and well-
groomed spectacle, with the Acting-Governoress
iu black and green and diamonds practically
demonstrating the advisability of having your
corsage cut V-shape dorsally instead of square if
you happen to incline to a fine figure. Miss Dar-
ley's dress suggested a good crushing—all yellow.
Mrs. Hutton, in good-looking black with biting
diamonds, carried a large bouquet of daffodils.
Mrs. Prendergast (lion, sec.) in pale blue, and Mrs.
Brennan (hqn; sec;) in pale-pink set one another
off admirably. Mrs. G. Russel I-Jones wore a
delicate brocade of up-to-date cut; Mrs. Rennie
was in sunbeam-yellovir silk, and so was Miss
-»l‘Donagh—but the evening dresses were rather
hustled by the fancy-set girls, who absorbed most
of the attention.
Mrs. Prendergast’s Gainsboro’ set bore away
the bell. The dress was a cream satin with Maud
Millett fichu of white chiffon—big black velvet
hat trimmed with feathers and pink roses, black
mitts and a black wand with pink roses and
ribbons on top. The Misses Fitzgerald and Mias
Nellie Hill all looked ch inning in the picturesque
garb (they were poudre, too), and the last-named
demoiselle’s skilful handling of her Aaron’s rod
must have made her partners rise up and call her
blessed. In one set a girl with a Maypole nearly
poked her partner's eye out—though, perhaps, she
did it on purpose? According to an old wives’
fable, you have to marry a person if you blind him,
and the general matrimonial outlook just now its
rather desperate. Mrs, Cape’s Shepherdess set
was rather lame about the petticoats.
The interest of Mrs. Harvey’s Army and Navy
set centred in the men who wore the gaudy garb
of (polite) butchering and buccaneering with good
wall-poster effect, but the ladies wore ordinary (in
one or two cases very ordinary) evening dress with
a slight draping of tricolor ribbon. Mrs. Delo-
hery’s “ Winter ” set was white with scarlet birds
and white wands topped with scarlet, and a “ pink
and blue ” set (more suggestive of delf than china)
and a floral set were the rest of the "fancy”
goods. One misguided but comely maiden, not in
the fancy sets, came as Lydia from “Dorothy,”
evidently imagining the occasion was “costume ”
throughout. However, I don’t suppose she
cared ; she possessed a very neat ankle, and per-
haps only felt grateful all the evening that her
petticoats were a good half-yard shorter thin any
other giil s on the floor. Only one Gaiety girl
turned up, so far as I saw—Laura Kearney, in
t rat outre black gaberdine of hers.
Very few flowers were carried at either the
Tempe or Masonic ball—the reason being: that the
frost and the drought combined have made flowers
a. golden luxury in Sydney lately. Roses a shil-
ling to eighteenpence apiece—daffodils threepence
each—carnations and gardenias almost as dear as
diamonds. No wonder the fascinating Gee Gees
aren't thrown enough verdure to make a Sunday*
size button-hole for the call-boys.
The big Masonic ball in aid of the Freemasons’
Benevolent Institution, held in Sydney Town
Hall on the 31st ult., was a scintillating spectacle
—the decorations running to scented fountains,
palms and other Sybaritish trimmings, although
bare walls would have passed unnoticed on the
occasion, seeing how gorgeous in themselves are
full-fig Masonic fetes. And the last ball was no
exception. The Grand procession, with the arch
of steel and all the rest of the historical pageant,
was certainly the gaudiest shilling’s-worth the
Town Hail galleries have got this season ; and
when the .lengthy Grand Master Abbott (they
always choose a large-size G.M., I notice—some-
body with a good physical frontage, as one might
say, so that the Masonic jewellery and fancy-work
will have plenty of shop-front) appeared with his
dress-suit almost hidden by his jewelled and
sparkling regalia, the mi se-en-scene was admirable.
George Kignold himself couldn’t havestaged things
better. Ihe steel arch was beautifully done,
though I must confess I had misgivings as to how
the shorter “chapters” would manage to preserve
the arc when such sons of Anak as the Acting-
Governor and the Gram! Master had to pass under
it after the style of “Oranges and lemons.”
However, nobody had to save his scalp by ducking.
Supper was comprehensively served at the lavish
hour of 10.30, and the music of the N.S. \V. Artil-
lery band, kindly lent by Major-General Hutton,
made poetry of the dancing. Altogether, the
Masonic ball - committee had reason to be
gratified.
There was every sort of dress on the floor, from
the Acting-Governoress’s magpie blend and the
Grand Alistress’s stand-alone black-satin with the
usual glittering fixings, to a lady in coffee-
color nun s-veiling with a cluster of silver
flowers, which she had evidently got off a wed-
ding cake. Some of the dresses were rather
daringly V-shaped, and I wondered (when the
transferment of Masonic regalia took place)
why those Alasons whose aprons decorated the
mure decollete didn’t hang the little blue hand-
kerchief-sachets round the ladies’ necks instead of
their waists? But, after all, women occupy a
back seat on these occasions—they always seem to
me to take up the position of the homely hen at
Alasonic outbreaks—because it is then that the
soberly-clad male bursts forth into the gorgeous
coloringwhich the barnyard monarch has appropri-
ated since the Garden of Eden. At such times you
can t help thinking that perhaps men have made a
mistake in leaving all the finery to women. Nature
never works that way—or only in rare instances—
and yet men disregard her example, and wear all
the snuffy hen-colors themselves, while women
have all the rainbow tailings and cockadoodledo.
Perhaps fine clothes are really at the bottom of
the Women’s Suffrage agitation—like the cuckoo
(I think it was a cuckoo) which stole a peacock’s
tail and fancied itself a lawn-bird on the strength
of it ! D
Apropos of balls, in justice to the Tempe ball com-
mittee-men I wish to say that they never requested
the patronage or presence of Alayor Lees at their
dance, and a recent report I made to that effect
was incorrect in detail—it was to the suburban
R.G. charity ball that Sydney’s Alayor refused
the light of his spectacles, though experts say the
result would have been the same anywhere.
Alayor Lees isn’t a ball-goer or giver. i have
only once seen him and his mayoress on the bees-
wax. and the rigid manner in which he confines
his official attention to, say, drainage questions
and that soit of thing, strips our hitherto rather
“smart” mayoralty of the lively air with which
ex-Mayors Bnrdekiu and Manning invested it.
\ tl ,(Jll ßht the most blood-curdling thing about
“The Shop Girl,” at Sydney Lyceum, was the
slip-slop get-up of Mr. Hooley (Alonkhouse), pro-
prietor of the Royal stores. Air. AI. evidently
dressed the part from English— not Australian—
models, but if “the drama’s laws the drama’s
patrons give,” Air. AI. should certainly evolute
into more dazzling linen and a white handkerchief
instead of a green one when essaying the part.
From a local d.o. point of view there couldn’t be
too much pompousness and collar about “ Alister-
ooley.” Convincingness was not with Air. Fred.
Raye s attire as Aliggles, either—who ever saw a
shop-walker in light trousers and a sac coat selling
perambulators to the aristocracy? None of the
men turned out smartly in “The Shop Girl,”
barring Bradfield—and he owjht to know whether
his clothes fit him or not, so I hear. Charles
Ryley sported very so-so apparel as the millionaire
—indeed he almost appeared to have conceived the
part a la Jimmy Tyson, who is probably the
most-plainly, though not the worst, tailored mil-
lionaire on earth. But the girls were in full
feather. Aliss Aloore, as the Shop Girl, hadn’t
the chance to what you call “dress,” but her
black silk frock, with vviiite collar and call's,
and shoes with big buckles, were quite the most
becoming things 1 have seen her wear. The second
act, “Flower Girl” gown—an impression of red
and green and spangles—was too bizarre to exactly
suit Aliss Aloore’s Quakerish style, though the
whole effect was charming, naturally. Decima
made quite a hit with “Hi Hi”—a triple encore,
with floral trimmings, following her arch render-
ing of the ballad of the ballerina.
Grace Palotta, in the meaningless part of Lady
Uodo, sang a delicately quaint song about the
“Naughty, naughty man in the moon,” which
was loudly re-demanded, and rewarded with some
garden-stuff. Allte. I*. sings it while wearing a
very dignified garment of white brocade, with
pearl and silver trimmings, and quite a Parisian
head-dress a huge half-star of “diamonds,”
punctuated vviih purplish roses. A posy of purple
flowers and ribbons went with the turn-out, which
was in the very best taste, and also presented a
novelty that women .’with fiddle-string gullets are
sure to copy slavishly—l mean the deep band of
the same material as the gown, and embroidered
with Pearls and silver, like the corsage
which Aliss Palotta wore round her neck. Lady
Dodo’s first gown, of pale lemon-color silk with a
white crepe underdress and a few artistic touches
of black, was a deserving garment, especially
when topped off by a piquant black velvet hat
and feathers. Apropos of Li Palotta (who is
married, by the way), a love-lorn youth wrote to
her for her portrait the other day—enclosing his
own as a guarantee of good faitli ! As he is a
married man, this line of proceeding was—er—
indiscreet, to say the least of it.
But, then, married men are not always careful.
I hear of a well-known muchly-married man—a
pillar of the church, and all that—who recently
sent a fatherly reply to a “distressed widow’’
advt. and signed his full name with a flourish !
While men persist in spilling documentary evi-
dence all over the place in this foolish way, the
adventuress of melodrama who gets board and
lodging merely for the trouble of showing her host
a little pink note now and then will never be
wiped out.
In the “Shop Girl ” (which wouldn’t sound half
so broadly vulgar if they all rattled through it as
Brad Held does) Maud Hobson wore one gorgeous
garment as Ada Smith, which was picturesque
enough at all events—mustard-yellow satin with a
cape of yellow lace and braces of brown fur, the
corsage further adorned with clusters of yellow
roses—just the sort of frock a shop girl would
select for a “trouser’’ out of Hooley’s emporium !
It was topped with a rather taking thing in
coal-scuttle bonnets tied under the left ear in a
big bow and trimmed with a yellow feather, but
though Miss Hobson is always radiantly lovely
—a big woman never looks so well in a Scoop
bonnet tied under one ear as a small woman,does.
The latter always reminds you of a baby, but the
former wildly suggests the lady who borrows
little Mary’s hat to go out for the beer. Madge
Rossell (she is only 18) scores her prettiest in the
charming Japanese dance —the chrysantheme
draperies of blue satin and scarlet exactly suiting
her. Her light and dainty dance on a sprained
ankle was a marvel of pluck. Mrs. Phelps sported
the most blasphemous garment in the play—a
loud-swearing combination of yellow, with streaks
of gravy red—as if somebody had been trailing
the grilled steak over the butter.
Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society hadn’t a
very enthusiastic turn-out for its concert on
Bank Holiday, in Sydney Town Hall. I thought
to hear Hazou applauded when he got into the
box—seeing it was his first appearance after his
voyagmgs—but not a heel-tap came from the
assemblage which nearly filled the big hall. Cer-
tainly the gifted conductor skipped into position
in a hurry, to play the Anathema ushering
in Acting - Gov. Harley and two daughters,
backed up by Captain Hangar—but there
was time for one round of applause. I
have often noticed that when an audience may
he generally described as having a flower in its
hair it usually isn’t cordial. Perhaps because its
clothes are too tight. The S. A.O.S. played
delightfully on th • whole, an 1 the highly-polished,
all-wool items contribute;! at intervals by Nellie
Young and Mr. DM gar 'cellist Strauss made excel-
lent diversion. The Eroica symohony was the
Society’s great card, and though the well-meaning
orchestra got in a few ear-achey effects here anil
there in the difficult work, it was still a success oil
the whole and most gratifying to Signor Hazon,
and to Rivers Allpress, who coached the society
in this great work during Hazon’s absence. The
Peer Gynt suite and the Tannhanser overture
were also very taking items on a most classical
bill. The S. A.O.S. is nothing if not classic. No
composer who isn’t positively blue-mouldy need
apply.
The second of the Esty-Marsh operatic recital?
in Sydney Centenary Hall, on Monday, would
have been a great success had manager Sykes
exercised his gift of accompaniment-playing for
the benefit of the co. and not left Herr Vollmar
to do so much. Accompanists are born, not
made. The operatic portion of the concert was
“ Maritana,” and Miss Esty scored a great success
with the “Scenes that are Brightest” recitative
and aria, but the debonair Mr. Marsh made the
hit of the evening with “In Happy Moments.”
For his modulated and melodious rendering of
that sterling old chestnut he was rewarded with
whistles from the gods and weird cries of “’cor !”
from the front seats, to which he was obliged to
respond. Ida Osborne made a welcome appearance
with the E.-M. Co. Her smooth voice and roving
dark eyes were great additions to the programme,
which also included Her Vollmar, who played a
'cello solo exquisitely. A very good house turned
up on both the first and second nights.
The distinguishing characteristics of the Mad-
den entertainments, ntMelb. Govmentouse, writes
my Melb. correspondent, are the air of friendly
hospitality which pervades them and the de-
butante show on the dais early in the evening.
The group of maidens, clad in white, standing
apart, undergoing informal inspection, strongly
suggests to the cynically-minded hong's picture,
“The Slave Market.” On Thursday evening last
the display of “comers-out” quite eclipsed that
at the previous dance. Some fourteen girls, each
more or less bewilderingly pretty, went through
the ordeal, and were rewarded by being intro-
duced by the hostess to the smartest and
most eligible youths in the room. In my
opinion, the “beauty cake” for that evening
would go to Miss Leura Lugg, an exceeding
dainty maiden in a Watteau-shepherdess costume
of white brocade flowered over with pink and blue
brightened up with silver sequins; to Miss Eva
Woolcott, radiant in white satin, lilies-of-the-
valley, and lace; and to Miss Singleton, a pretty
girl with what Ouida calls “tawny ” hair and a
cast of face adored by Burne-Jones. Judging
from the women present, it was easy to see that
during the coming season, which promises to be
very gay, there will bo a good stock of beauty to
draw on for smart functions.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Speaker Abbott has been elected president
of the N.S. W. Art Society, defeating Mr. Blox-
some, who has held the position for a year past.
The Speaker is not known to have manifested any
spacially-artistic sympathies, and the only reason
fur his appointment seems to be that he is a man
of political arid social influence. An organisation
which cannot keep within its own ranks any
honor which m iy attach to its presidentship only
invites the contempt of the public.

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
The first forfeits, just declared for Caulfield
and Melb. Cups, show very few non-contents of note.
N.S.'V. is still well represented iti Caulfield Cup by
Vanitns, Solarium, Alahee, Nobleman, ami Division—and
the absolute winner will likely spring from t his quintette
if it can beat the Victorians, Idolater and Tullamore.
• * * *
It is on the cards that the winners of both the
Caulfield and Melb. Cups were seen out at Moorefleld
(N.S.W.) and Caulfield (Vic) last Saturday, competing in
races the aggregate value of which amounted to £l5O.
The speedy and staying Vanitas, who won the Tramway
Handicap (6 fur.) at Moorefield, carrying Bst. 91h., is, as
yet, not nearly ripe, and with 7st. lOlh. he should run
very well in the Caulfield Cup.
J * » • *
Delaware, Mahee, Ronda, Coolalta, and True
Blue-witi do battle in Melb. Cup, and theirmost dangerous
opponents from the Southern province may lie found to
be Dreamland, Palo Alto, and The Admiral. The latter will
likely run better in this race than in Caulfield Cup, despite
the fact of his being now absolutely first favorite for that
raoe. Dreamland, Mirtculeux. Marshal Ney, Tullamore,
Eumarrah, Taurus, War Dance, and Carlton (Hales) ran
in ttie Balaclava Stakes (one mile), at Caulfield, and have
all accepted for the Caulfield Cut'. It one of these is to
win this valuable prize it may lie Tullamore, the property
Of a well-known Vic. surgeon, “Mr. T. Naghten.”
Eumarrah, Merman, Taurus and St. David are also ac-
ceptors for Melb. Cup. It looks as if Scobie, with Dream-
land, is going to adopt the “training in public” tactics
which were so successful with Patron last year. Palo
Alto, a Robinson Crusoe horse, is already whispered about
as a most likely outsider, and if he represent, Mr. Purdies
instead of Portsea he should be well worth watching.
*•• » ♦
Pilot Boy, Oxide, Milkmaid, Sunburst, Res-
ponse, Euroka, and Voluey at first sight seem the most
leniently treated in the Epsom (Randwick) Handicap.
Volney and Euroka, the second and third in this raoe last
year, may fill the first two places on this occasion, though
the best of Air. Forrester’s, probably Alilkmaid, looks
dangerous.
Oxide is even better treated in the Metrop., and,
if reserved for the race, should about win. Blue Cap
appears to have an undeniably good chance.
« » * *
Laundress, who will be ridden by Joe Tomlin,
is highly thought of for Caulfield Cup, hut Bst. 71b. is a
lot of weight for this speedy mare, who is more at home
over a short course than a distance.
* • * •
A compromise has been arrived at between the
two leading S.A. racing clubs and the bookmakers,
whereby reputable layers can do business on the “ tote
commission ” principle in the stands on S.A. racecourses.
The clubs have, in the opinion of many, made a serious
mistake.
• « • *
No democratic “sport ” was sorry to learn that
the V.R.C. dropped coin over its precious complimentary
meeting to Lord Hopetoun, the one and only meeting of
last racing year which didn’t show a profit to the club.
The farewell folly wou d have paid expenses hut for the
desire of Hopetoun’s worshippers to make it “worthy of
the occasion ”in the wav of stakes. The result proved
that they over-estimated the occasion’s worth by £460
11s. 6d.
• • • •
Unless anything happens to him in the mean-
time, Trenton's son, Dreamland, will likely remain
favorite for Melb. Cup until the dav of the race.
• * * •
It seems as if the V.R.C. G.N. dose is to be
repeated on the Caulfield G.N. double-event books. There
were enough defaulters over the first, and how will it be
should Daimio win the Caulfield Steeple 1
• • • •
Sep. Miller’s hi. f, Raak (Glorious—Eira),
winner of the V.A.T.C. Sapling Stakes, was the first Vic.
two-year-old victor of the year. Flintlock and Glencoe,
both Carbine colts, ran unplaced, Trenton being second
and third with Bright Eyes and Contempt.

They tried a locally-built starting-machine at
the first day’s racing of the Broken Hill Jockey Ciuh’s
meeting. In the second race one horse took the harrier
»in his month and another ran into it; and when the thing
actually did “go off,” only two mu. of eight horses went
away. Then the machine was discarded for the day.

The feature of Saturday’s Moorefield meeting
was Clive’s win of the Moorefleld H uidieap, wherein he
ran his mile and a quarter, with Bst. 71b., in 2.9 J.

W. R. Wilson didn’t, at time of writing, cotton
to the idea of closing the St. Alban’s lottery on Oct.
24th. Geo. Adams, who stands to lose all the cost of
advertising in addition to his com. if the sweep doesn’t
fill, is quite agreeable to the October date for drawing,
but the owner of the ’osses feels concerned about the
valuable racing engagements which fall due at that time.

Gibson Brothers, the twin owners of Daimio,
are generally understood to race their one horse purely
for the sake of sport and the stakes. However, a lady
correspondent has it that “they wager, hut when the
expenses to jockey, trainer, &c., have been paid, the rest is
sent anonymously to t he hospitals,” which, if true, is about
the oddest tiling iu charity schemes that Tub Bulletin
has ever struck.

Boxing has knocked out its own popularity in
America, and Corbett is going to take all the dollars he
can by exhibition-spars, hall-punching, &c., before he
risks meeting Jackson in the ring. Returned Australians
say that Corbett, now 23, has only to wait two or three
years to walk over Jackson, so quickly is the darkey age-
ing.
* • • * •
At Sydney Amateur Club, on Monday night,
there was a good boxing programme. Barron and Mason
opened with a willing four rounds ; next Ned Burden
boxed Richie ; Burden is in grand buckle, and his match
with Funnel!, next Monday night, should prove an exhibi.
tion. Mick Dooley and Tom Taylor, both fat as aider-
men, boxed four rounds of circus and smiles which
brought down the house ; the priestly face of Dooley,
and the wink ’av ’im, and the way he “shammed
frightened” and yelled “police!” was worthy of Elton.
There was a hush of excitement for the evening’s event,
the 10-round contest between Tweedie and Foster.
The moment the boys shaped, Foster worked Tweedie,
with deceptive, cat-like movements, into the corner of
the ring and ttien let go witli a bang. Tweedie covered
his vital spots with Ills arms and rushed his way out.
This first rqjmd was fast and fierce. The second round
was at lightning pace, and the hoys utterly exhausted
one another. The third round began like the second, lint
before it was over Tweedie was too exhausted to go on,
and the referee awarded the match to Foster.
• * * •
If Corbett and Fitzsimmons do meet on 31st
Oct. at Dallas, Texas, it will be the biggest boxing event
the world has seen. It is to come off in a huge amphi-
theatre capable of seating 50,000 people. Tickets one,
three, five and ten pounds each, with a few boxes at a
century. ’Tis a strange world. Who would have believed
it possible, a few years back, that the scarlet-headed
lamp-post—who could he seen any Sunday morning,
dressed-in-his Sunday best, walking down Glebe Point
Hoad (Sydney) alongside his wife, with a youngster in his
arms, would turn out so brilliant a gladiator '?
* * » *
Notwithstanding his many defeats. Creed on
must have fared well in the States to enable him to refuse
to meet one Butler on the score of “purse not big
enough.” Such is luck. Mick Dooley, who could thrash
a paddock-full of Crcedoits, would jump at the chance of
a smaller purse than Creedon refused.
• « * «
What an unfortunate fellow Dooley has been 1
None at his weight game to tackle him, he has been the
tryer-out for such cattle as Peter Jackson, Paddy Slavic,
and Joe Goddard. Dooley never went into the ring with
the idea of standing up to the black man, but his fights
witli Pad((y Slavic and O ddard were touch-and-go affairs,
Dooley being beaten in the end by sheer strength and
weight of metal.

The next Australian Eleven goes under the
auspices of the Melb. and Sydney Associations. Should
Giffeu try to dictate (as he did last time over brother
Walter), he himself may be left out, as he is not in Eng-
land the invaluable man he is in Australia. But the
omission of Giffen would, no doubt, mean the withdrawal
of the whole S.A. brigade, which would never do.
Many of the “certainties” favor H. Trott as
captain. “Trott, though a howler, does not expect, as
Giffen does, to get a wicket every ball ; he not only taxes
advice, hut asks for it, whereas Giffen will ignore the
unanimous wish of a whole side. Ami Trott is much
liked by cricketers—an important consideration for a
season’s tour.” Moreover, Trott is a fat man, and every
captain should he fat if it can he so arranged. In picking
the next team for England, the first step will be the ex-
clusion of drunks.
• * • *
King Giffen had decided that did South Aus-
tralia treat England in the return match he would
promptly and easily arrange for taking a purely S.A.
team to London. Even now he has not utterly abandoned
the idea.
* * * *
The Pirates and Universities were in great
fettle for the final Cup contest on Sydney Cricket Ground
last Saturday. Pirates were the favorites, but the
Universities showed the omens of victory two
fat men. Twice the Pirates were pressing up°n the
University line, and twice a University man had tlie
luck and skill to intercept a Pirate pass and dash
away with the Dali, once touching it down himself, and
another time passing it, at the last moment, to another
“ Uni ” who touched it down behind the posts. Then,
too, Nelson, the Pirate captain, kicked a field-goal, the
ball touching a player so slightly in its course that it
deviated not an inch, nevertheless debarring a score.
Pirates, in their eagerness, lost their heads a little, but
the team with the fat men played with cool science,
“Uni’’won by 8 points to 3, and the match is particu-
larly interesting since it proves that not even football is
free from the dire influence of the fat man.
The Challenge Cup has to be won twice in suc-
cession or three times in all, and has been contested for
the last four seasons. This is the order of wins: Rand-
wick, University, Randwick, University.

Essondon’s defeat by N. Melb., the weakest
senior team, seems inexpliotide. Possibly they will rise
up and heat Melb. to-day (Aug. 10).

A. A. Middleton (Vic.) won the Victorian 50-
miles road cycle race last Saturday in 3h. 23m. The first
half was ridden in the teeth of the wind, a condition

Grand Fianenr heads last season’s list of Ans;
traiian winning sires, twelve descendants of the unbeaten
horse having won races, value 19162—Patron and
Patroness's Melb. and Sydney Cups being mainly respnn-
sihle. Trenton is second witli 17 wins, totalling £7613;
and Sheet Anchor is third in the list. Then come
Robinson Crusoe, Nordenfeidt, Splendour, Marvellous,
Chester, Grandmaster, &c., the last-named having the
largest number of winners and victories, 26 of his stock
having pull-d off 66 races. Chester still holds the sires’
record with £17,872 won in 1889 90—a great performance,
considering lie did not “get” that year’s Melb. Cup
winner.
Piles Cured. —Owing to the fact that numbers
of people think piles are incurable, the proprietor
of the new “Cannalin ” remedies has given in-

pamphlets are to be sent to all applicants in the

even after years of treatment or from operation,
are specially invited to write to the dopfit for

SKIN DISEASE
CUBED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Burtner, Keezletown, Va,,
writes, as follows;
“ Shortly after leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it 'enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
»ver three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.”

•• It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Glftdvs has derived from
‘Bengera Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
wo should never he able to
rea r her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
“If every mother knew of
its value no other Would bo
used.”
The world’s morality illustrated. A S.A.
publican lately “ sacked ” a barmaid because, in
her joy at winning .£5 on the races, she got drunk.
The old Deutscher, in “ explaining ’’ the matter,
said : “ I minds it not zo mooch ov a girl gits
drunk on vine und help to make de poys shout it;
but ven she get drunk on my own viskey, den I
dinks it vas disgraceful.”
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
“ We landed at Cole’s wharf the day the
Sacramento went ashore. I saw the female
emigrants who had arrived by that ship. When
they landed they entered into conversation with
the men on the wharf, dispensing with the for-
mality of introduction, and showing no maidenly
coyness. At length an emigrant officer came and
marshalled the ladies in processional order, re-
pressed all indecorous levity, and retreated with
his company towards Flinders-street. . • The
descendants of those ladies may be seen in great
numbers, to this day, standing at street corners,
and are called ‘larrikins.’” —From Prairie and
Bush.
Sporting men will be interested to know
that a date has been fixed for the drawing of the
St. Alban’s lottery. The tickets have gone off so
well that Mr. Geo. Adams, who is conducting the
lottery, is confident that the whole 125,000 will be
sold within the next three months, and it has been
definitely decided to hold the drawing on October
24. This will be after the Caulfield Cup, but
before the Y.R.C. meeting, and Mr. W. R.
Wilson’s familiar livery will therefore be absent
from Flemington next November. The distribu-
tion of such a fine lot of rising three-year-olds as
those in the St. Alban’s stable at present may be
expected to slightly unsettle the market for the
next Derby and Cup.*
“You see,’' he said, “my mate and I
were droving, and we had a wild lot of bullocks
always breaking away and giving us no end of
trouble. One night while I was taking my turn,
standing in front of the fire warming my heels and
thinking of home (of course, I had my long dog-
poisoner’s spurs on), away went the mob without
any warning ; so, jumping on the old grey, I sailed
after ’em. But the old horse, the laziest that ever
kicked along, streaked like greased lightning,
regularly galvanised into new life. For a moment
I was downright puzzled, but, happening to look
back, I saw a stream of smoke coming from each
flank, and the mystery was solved. Hang me
if those blanky spurs weren't red-hot. Fact.”
“ Crom-a-boo,” that funniest of Irish comic
football songs, is selling faster than ever.*
The £5-bales and shopping by post, in-
augurated by Riley Bros. 21 years ago, made that
firm’s name a household word not only in N.S.W.,
but throughout Australia, Maoriland and Fiji.
This remarkable success brought out many imita-
tors, who, however, only partially adopted the
original system, sending goods only to railway
towns, whereas Riley Bros, sent the free
to any spot whatever. Once, in the infant days
of the system, the firm paid £2 17s. to send a £ 5-
bale to Mount Brown, which is away in the
extreme N.W. of N.S.W., on the “Burke and
Wills track.” Over 50,000 have already
been sent away; and, knowing perfectly the in-
dustrial and climatic conditions of every district,
and giving more attention than ever to the
bale and shopping by post, and having entirely
revised prices and brought out a new price-list
and illustrated catalogue (3000 useful articles,
with prices), the firm directly enables the remotest
back-blocks resident to take full and cheap ad-
vantage of an enormous and varied stock. The
price-list is sent post free on application ; articles
from Is. upwards will be sent by post; £2 parcels
will be sent free by rail or steamer; the famed
.£5-bale will be sent free to Coolgardie, Carpen-
taria, or anywhere. Although the principal part
of Riley Bros.’ business is in drapery, boots and
shoes, the firm executes any order for saddlery,
harness, ironmongery, tobacco, stationery—in
short, for any part of the stock of a large country
store. Not long ago a whole surveyor’s turn-out
was sent away—horses, carts, waggons, instru-
ments, tents, etc.*

South’ Wales do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows.: Whereas I suffered severely^from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was qmte unable to
attend to mv business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hopef obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal ‘ Alfaline Vitality Piels,
which I solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured MEwithinafow weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. Ihe Alkaline PILES also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.

mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr RASSMUSSEN.-Dear Sir, -1 think it my duty to

and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their

Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, wmcn
I do most heartily wish you. . T „

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both_ in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be moat happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr, E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills psinee then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish. Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and

Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full

Confidence is the very backbone of social
and commercial life, and confidence is only begot-
ten by fidelity. These apparent platitudes are
designed to describe the raison d'etre of the
Trustees, Executors, and Agency Company, Ltd.,
,of Melb., whose business announcement appears
elsewhere. The company acts as executor,
administrator, trustee, attorney under power, or
agent for absentees, &c., &c. The main advan-
tages offered to the public are absolute security as
trustee, &0., and economical and efficient repre-
sentation as agent. The company doesn’t die or
leave the country as an individual might. As its
profits are derived as commission it is not exposed
to ordinary risks of trade. Its position can be
ascertained at any time, and it is subject to the
constant supervision of the courts. Also, £lO,OOO
is invested in the name of the Treasurer of Vic-
toria as guarantee for the proper performance of
any duties undertaken. The management is
sound and good, and the company’s very poetical
motto, culled apparently from Tennyson, “ I go
on for ever,” may be regarded as fully justified by
the circumstances of the ease. *

the latest revival of “atrocities in Armenia” (a

Dear Bulletin,Curly Dick” Hunt,
who was knocked off a footboard at Ballarat
cattle-yards, the other day, by one of the beasts
he had slaughtered in thousands, receiving in-
juries which terminated fatally, was, in his
prime, one of the smartest butchers that ever
struck Australia. I never remember being roused
to a higher glow of sporting enthusiasm than by
the bullock-dressing match which took place in
58, 'for .£5O aside, between Dick and William
Mnthner, a young Sydney native. Th« match
came off near the site of the Eureka Stockade,
Walter Craig (of Craig’s Hotel), whose jockey
carried crape on his sleeve when he won the 1870
Melb. Cup with Nimblefoot, being one of the
timekeepers. The bullocks were killed and bled,
and each placed under a rope running through an
overhead block to a ready-manned winch. It was
a treat to watch the men when the word to start
was given. Hunt, with one bound, reached the
operating end of his bullock, slipped his knife
round the neck once, then, taking the instrument
in his teeth, he seized the horns with both hands,
placed his knee against the neck, gave one terrific
wrench, which only required a slash with the
knife to complete decapitation, and the head was
thrown by an outward shove that bumped the
ground and made the spectators hop to miss the
spatter. The same rapid operation was performed
at the joints of the legs, then a plunge with the
knife through the muscles of the hind-legs to
admit the ends of the camel, and, as Hunt gave
the word to hoist, he made two preliminary
slashes from the severed joints to the centre of
the belly, then, getting his knife under the skin,
he made one long upward cut the full length of
the carcase, and had the hide half-off by full-
length strokes before the bullock was swung.
Both men were ambidexterous, and about equal
with the knife; though Hunt made one left-
handed stroke in skinning that sent his arm clean
through the hide. But he showed marked
strength and superiority with the saw and bill-
knife. The match was won by Hunt in 9mins.,
Mutimer finishing Slsecs. later. It was anything
but a good performance for the winner, as he had
frequently done the same thing in Bmins. in prac-
tice.—Old Sport.

A NEW VIRTUE
Has been discovered in
Hum
tVhich will be welcomed by all who regularly
keep it in their houses ; in the first symptons of
Influenza, some Homocca, quantity immaterial,
applied in the nostrils has been found to check
the further spread of this distressing malady,
and In a very few hours the system is
able to eject the infection and prevent further
mischief.
ft will stop a painful Influenza
cold almost like magic.
A
r/
«
' * i
A cold begins with inflammation of the membra-
neous lining of the intricate little passages of the
nose (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
small scale). Homocea at once subdues the in-
flammation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
relieving the feeling of “ stuffiness.’’ Moreover, it
forms a protective covering for the delicate mem-
brane, and prevents cold air, fog, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play.
Not much is known about the way in which influ-
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
Homocea may,therefore, be confidently recomended
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
Stiff Joints, Pains in the Back, Lumbago,
Strained Muscles, Cramps, can be got rid
of at once by Homocea, which instantly
touches the spot afflicted. Homocea as a
pain relieving, soothing, and curative
lubricant has no equal in the world of
healing remedies; it is a specific for
Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Pa-
ralysis, Convulsions, Bruises, Strained
Muscles, Pains in the Joints, Aches and
Sprains, Eczema, Burns, Tooth-ache,
Face-ache, Chilblains, Piles, Boils,
Ulcers, Stings, Chaps, and all kindred ills
and complaints.
Henry M. Stanley writes : " Whitehall,
London. Dear Sir, Your ointment called
1 Homocea ’ was found to be the most soothing
and efficacious unguent that I could possibly
have for my fractured limb, as it seems to retain
longer than any other, that oleaginousness so
requisite for perfect and efficient massage. The
fault of embrocations generally, is that they
harden and require .warmth, whereas yours,
besides being particularly aromatic, is as soft as
oil, and almost instantly mollifying in the case
of severe inflammation.
“ Yours faithfully, Henry M. Stanley.”

Jacky.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With no child companionship, it was very lonely
for me, out at the station homestead ; so I was
more than delighted when father brought Jacky
home with him, one day, and told me he was to
be my playmate, and that I was to treat him
kindly, just as if he were a little brother.
At first we had to keep the little fellow a
prisoner, until he became acquainted with us, and
with his new surroundings ; but he soon got over
all shyness, and submitted kindly to the trammels
of civilisation. He and I became excellent friends,
and roamed together within the inner enclosure ;
beyond I was not allowed to go without adult
escort.
A victim to bronchitis, I had been a prisoner
in the house nearly all the winter, and our idle
rambles on those lovely spring days are among
my pleasantest memories. We could not con-
verse, as the little native was unable to connect
English words into sentences, although he readily
learned simple words and short phrases. Some-
times of an evening he would snuggle down in a
corner and hold quiet converse with himself in a
melodious pianissimo ; at others, he would whistle
fragments of tunes he had picked up, and, on
these latter occasions, he was always in excellent
spirits, and we would play with the kitten until
bedtime, when Jacky, by his own desire, was let
out for the night—one of his keenest objections
to civilisation being the habit of sleeping in-
doors. At the first peep of dawn he would
waken me by vigorously tapping at my bedroom
window, and we would go down to the bails and
superintend the milking of the cows—an operation
in which Jacky always took the keenest interest.
Although the cuisine of the house seemed to
suit the gastronomic tastes of my playmate, he
retained one objectionable appetite of his race—a
relish for wood-grubs—after a surfeit of which
delicacy he always wended his way to the creek
and “ topped-off ” with a dessert of watercresses.
On several occasions, after these debauches, he
was very ill, and father relieved his sufferings with
generous doses of castor oil. Jacky eventually
regarded these as a portion of the feast, and
signified (by lying on his back, with his legs
drawn up) that there were disturbances in the
interior, and that castor - oil was an urgent
desideratum.
One day we were roaming along the inner
boundary, when Jacky suddenly flitted over the
fence, and darted into the bush. He was off after
grubs. On these occasions he ignored all com-
mands, and I was powerless to detain him. It
was nearly tea-time when he returned, and by
nightfall he was in a sorry plight—lying on his
back and making strange guttural noises. The
usual dose of castor-oil was given him, and he
seemed to have revived by the time I was sent to
bed.
When I awoke in the morning it was bright
sunlight, and father was standing at my bedside
looking very grave. “ Where’s Jacky ?” I asked.
“Bad news, sonny,” said father. I knew in-
stinctively what it was and burst into tears, with-
out waiting to hear more.
How sorrowful were those after-days ! I have
mourned other and greater losses since then ; but
no grief of mine has been more acute or sincere
than was that for the loss of my only playmate.
Whether out of sympathy for me or for the death
of Jacky I cannot say, but both mother and Ellen
(our usually emotionless old cook) were reduced to
tears, and I think father was very near it.
A post-mortem revealed thirteen large, un-
digested grubs and a hard ball of watercress in
Jacky’s crop. We buried him in a candle-box, at
the foot of the big gum-tree, and it was many
weeks before I so far forgot my sorrow as to
neglect watering the flowers which mother had
planted on the little mound.
That was long ago—far away in the bush ; but,
on some days, I wish I could exchange the veran-
dah-posts of Bourke-street for the tall straight
trunks of the gums ; the jostling, impatient crowd
for the gentle, patient sheep; the discordant
street-cries for the hilarious laughter of the
’burra; and the monotonous, unyielding pavement
for the lawn of that station-farm of twenty years
ago.

Dear Bulletin, — Re paint - suggesting
whisky, here’s a unique experience. Well-mean-
ing person locks up in his room a “tanked” friend,
who fossicks out a pint of methylated spirit, and
therewith solaeeth his captivity to such purpose
that, when he further strikes what he takes to be
another pint of the same, he negotiates that, with-
out discovering that it is—kerosene ! And he

Eugene Robespierre, said to be a grand-
nephew of the “sea-green incorruptible” of the
Terror days, has been hauled up in Paris for
giving short weight in coals. Probably one of
Robespierre’s ancestors was fined for selling bad
butter. The man whose name overshadows the
earth is generally sandwiched in between a genera-
tion which sells bad butter, and another which
gives light-weight in coals.
Arthur Orton’s precious “confession”
brings out all the vanity of the man. He boasts
of his cleverness in answering 9,300 out of 12,000
questions, and attributes his nonsuit in the first
trial to his counsel, Sergeant Ballantyne, whom
he had insulted. The fact was that Ballantyne
asked for a nonsuit when his fat client was hope-
lessly and disgracefully beaten. Coleridge’s cross-
examination had proved Orton to be an absurdly
hollow impostor. The fellow had every oppor-
tunity to change himself into Roger Tichborne
before the trial commenced. The whole uneventful
life of Roger was shown to him. Dozens of en-
thusiastic believers tried to load him up with facts,
but Orton wasted the time that he should have
devoted to Tichborne studies in bloating his
carcase and shooting pigeons.

Strong and lacker, at Melb. Town Hall, the other
day, said, “They had shown much of the apostle,
but little of the financier. They were abun-
dantly endowed with the spirit of their Master
when He said, ‘Feed the hungry,’ but without
His power of multiplying the loaves and fishes.
Even if the fairly practical clergymen he was com-
plimenting were a couple of ignorant little bethel
bigots, Chief Justice Madden’s endorsement of
the loaves and fishes myth would not have been
excusable. He surely isn’t paid a large salary to
hold up the tattered banner of religious supersti-
tion between the public and the light.

so tangled-up that the prosecution seemed to get
lost among the masses of figures; and Jabez, whose
capacity for arithmetic is boundless, had every
one of the transactions of all his companies in his
large, greasy head, and tripped up the Crown
lawyers constantly. He was calm, and fat and
urbane as ever. During the police-court hearing,
he drew a gentleman aside with a soft, moist
hand, to ask how Grace’s score was getting on,
and when he heard that the veteran had made his
100th century, he beamed through his glasses
with a childlike gladness. If Jabez B. is con-
victed, he will go off to gaol with an unctuous
smile on his face, and a look of absolute uncon-
cern ; and he will be a model prisoner, and a com-
fort to all the other inhabitants of the gaol. It is
pretty safe to lay long odds that he won’t collapse,
like Wilde, when the trouble really comes._ lat
and snuffle are proof against almost every kind of
disaster. Fat and cynicism evidently are not.

Dear Bulletin, —Re your “Ethics of
Oscar” —all conceptions of abstract ethical right-
ness or wrongness must have reference, either to
a postulated inborn criterion, or to a code cate-
gorically prescribed by some so-called “divine
revelation.” But, to those of us who see in ethics
no more than the gradually evolved product
of social expediency, any ethical standard, outside
the “ majority-sense ” of the community, is a mere
figment of the imagination. Might is, for us, not
only, as you say, “practically right,” but also
right absolutely and finally—a principle upon
which the stronger individual would every-
where deal with the weaker, did not the com-
munity, for the sake of its collective welfare,
interfere with a yet superior strength. The
“rights” of the individual, in a word, do not
appertain to him qua individual, but qua unit of
a social totality.—Heretic. [This confuses right
in theory with right in practice. “Practically”
—in practice—“ might is right ”—i.e, might makes
right, sets a conventional standard of right. But
might is not right “ absolutely, finally ” — i.e.,
abstractly and ethically—for thousands of com-
munity-majorities have upheld at various times
differing and contradictory standards of right—
which cannot all be right “ absolutely and finally.”
To say that “might is right absolutely and
finally ” is to find a moral sanction for tyranny,
murder, and outrage—surely a monstrous con-
clusion. As Donisthorpe says, “morality must
be tested by expediency,” but how can it be
shown that the burning of a “ Heretic ” is expe
dient, even from the point of view of humanity ?
And, from the point of view of the “Heretic,”
which has equal ethical right to consideration, it
is probably inexpedient, and therefore immoral.—

A Maorilander just returned from a trip

was induced to try “the egg.” > Now an egg-
shampoo is not what “ colonials ’ are used to;
and when the shampee was passing out he handed
the girl at the counter a ticket, Saidtshe “ Egg-
shampoo— one dollar, please.” Well, said the

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh 1 the mountains speak of sadness,
There is gloom on ridge and spur ;
But they cannot dim the gladness
In my heart because of her :
All day long I feel her near me ;
To my soul her presence steals ;
When I whisper she can hear me
Through the rolling of the wheels.
I can see my gold-haired Freda
(By the dull world undescried)
As I steer the old brown leader
Deftly down the mountain side ;
As I chide the lazy shatter
Through the flower-bespangled dells,
None but I can hear her laughter
Chiming sweet as silver bells.
And at times I hear her singing
Softly when the west winds blow,
And the feathered pines are swinging
On the range-top to and fro :
Dreamily I drive my cattle,
Lulled to sleep above their reins,
By the wheels’ eternal rattle
And the clinking of the chains.
And her songs of love have stirred me,
And I’ve answered from the shaft,
Till the wondering possums heard me
And the kookaburras laughed !
Passion reigns the wide world over;
Prince and pauper own his sway;
And a lover is a lover
Though he drive a two-horse dray !
Days are long and wheat’s to carry
Now, but when the summer’s by
Fate allowing, we shall marry,
Gold-haired Freda, you and I.
When in stress of winter weather
Flowers are dead and skies are gray,
We’ll go jogging home together
Loved and lover in the dray.
Life is dull and toil unending,
But the voice of Love is sweet,
And the tide is always tending
To the tryst where lovers meet;
Life is commonplace and real,
Yet along its rock-strewn way
Each man sees his own ideal
As he dreams upon his dray !

A subscriber to one of the largest Vic.
circulating libraries asked the librarian if they
kept back files of The Bulletin. “No,” was
the answer. “Then why not?—you tile all the
other papers, and why not The Bulletin ? ”
“ Well, we can’t,” said the librarian, “ too many
people use it; it’s always too ragged when it
leaves the table.”
The Wedding at Our Selection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Kate was soon to be married. Joe said
that must have been why Sandy Taylor had
come so often and had carried wood for the girls.
We talked a lot about the wedding, and were very
pleased it would be held in our own house, because
all of us could go then. None of us could work
for thinking of it —even Dad seemed to forget
that the corn hadn’t come up and that Mick Bros'
nan was going to summon him for half the fence.
Mother said we would want plenty of water for
the people to drink, so Sandy yoked his horse to
the slide,- and he, Dad and Joe started for the
springs.
The slide was the fork of a tree, alias a wheel-
less water-trolly. The horse was hitched to th e
butt-end, and a batten nailed across the prongs
kept the cask from slipping off going uphill.
Sandy led the way and carried the bucket; Dad
went ahead to clear the track of stones ; and Joe
straddled the cask to keep her steady.
It always took three to work the slide.
The water they brought was a little thick—
Old Anderson had been down and stirred it up
pulling a bullock out; but Dad put plenty ashes
in the cask to clear it.
Each of us had his own work to do. Sandy
knocked the partition down and decorated the
place with boughs; mother and the girls cooked
and covered the walls with newspapers, and Dad
gathered cow-dung and did the floor.
m • •
Two days before the wedding. All of us
were still working hard. Dad was up to his arm-
pits in a bucket of mixture, with a stack of cow-
dung on one side, and a heap of sand and the shovel
on the other. Dan and Joe were burning a cow
that had died just in front of the house, and
Sandy had gone to town for his tweed trousers.
A man in a long, black coat, white collar, and
new leggings, rode up, spoke to Dad and got off.
Dad straightened up and looked awkward, with
his arms hanging wide and the mixture dripping
from them. Mother came out. The cove shook
hands with her, but he didn’t with Dad. They
went inside —not Dad, who washed himself first.
Dan sent Joe to ask Dad who the cove was.
Dad spoke in a whisper and said he was Mr.
Somebody, the clergyman who was to marry Kate
and Sandy. Dan whistled and piled more wood
on the dead cow. Mother came out and called
Dan and Joe. Dan wouldn’t go, but sent Joe.
Dan threw another log on the cow, then thought
he would see what was going on inside.
He stood at the window and looked in. He
couldn’t believe his eyes at first, and put his head
right in. There were Dad, Joe and the lot of
them down on their marrow-bones saying some-
thing after the parson. Dan was glad that he
didn’t go in.
How the parson prayed ! Just when he said
“ lead us not into temptation ” the big kangaroo-
dog slipped in and grabbed all the fresh meat on
the table while their backs were turned ; but Dan
managed to kick him in the ribs at the door. Dad
groaned and seemed very restless.
When the parson had gone Dad said that what
he had read about “reaping the same as you sow”
was all rot, and spoke about the time when we
sowed two bushels of barley in the lower paddook
and got a big stack of rye from it.
# # #
w n
The wedding was on a Wednesday, and at
three o clock in the afternoon. Most of the people
came before dinner; the Harailtons arrived just
after breakfast. Talk of drays! the little paddook
couldn’t hold them
Jim Mullins was’the only one who came in to
dinner ; the others mostly sat on their heels in a
row and waited in the shade of the wire-fence,
The parson was the last to come, and as he passed
ih he knocked his head against the kangaroo-leg
hanging under the verandah. Dad saw it swing-
ing, and said angrily to Joe: “ Didn’t I tell you
to take that down this morning? ”
Joe unhooked it and said : “But if I hang it
anywhere else the dog’ll get it.” _
Dad tried to laugh at Joe and said, loudly:
“And what else is it for ?” Then he bustled Joe
off before he could answer him again.
Joe didnt understand, , , „ n
Ihen Dad said (putting the leg in a bag): Do
you want everyone to know we eat it, you ? ”
Top understood
The ceremony commenced. Those who could
squeeze inside did so-the others looked in at the
window and through the cracks in the chimney.
Mrs, M'Doolan led Kate out of the back-room;
then Sandy rose from the fire-place and stood
beside her. Everyone thought Kate looked very
nice; and orange blossoms ! You’d think she
was an orange-tree with a new bed-curtain thrown
over it. Sandy looked well, too, in his snake-belt
and new tweeds; but he seemed uncomfortable
when the pin that Dave put in the back of his
collar came out.
The parson didn’t take long; and how they
scrambled and tumbled over each other at the
finish ! Charley Mace said that he got the first
kiss ; Big George said he did; and Mrs. M'Doolan
was certain she would have got it only for the
baby.
Fun! there was fun! The room was cleared
and they promenaded for a dance—Sandy and
Kate in the lead. They continued promenading
until one of the well-sinkers called for the con-
certina—of course, we hadn’t one, but Jim Burke
jumped on his horse and went home for his.
Dance! they did dance !—until sun-rise. But
unless you were dancing you couldn’t stay inside,
because the floor broke up, and talk about dust!
—before morning the room was like a drafting-
vard
y '» # *
„ , , , , ~ ~ i j
Sandy had no selection then, so he and
Kate lived with us, and occupied the back-room—
Dan and Dave slept in the front-room, on the
floor. Dad did up the back room for Sandy and
Kate—stuffed rags in all the cracks, and hung
some bagging for a door. It served nearly as well
as a wooden door, and made less noise, though it
didn’t keep little Bill from looking in.
It was a great wedding ; and though years have
since passed, everyone says still it was the best
they were ever at.

The Bulletin is now to be read in Yic.
Parliamentary library. Hitherto it has been ex-
eluded as an “ objectionable ” paper which might
corrupt the minds of such saints as Tom Bent A
petition to the library committee asking that it be
placed on the table was taken round by Dr.
Maloney and signed by nearly 80 members.
The lady-students at Melb, Dental College
make astonishingly rapid progress, and some of
them are already much more competent to fill a
tooth than the average male creature who passes
for a qualified dentist.
Malicious and hysterical females will please
note that Alice Brown, of Melb., who recently
told a circumstantial tale regardingabogus outrage
committed upon her, has gotthreemonths’imprison-
ment for perjury. It isn’t much, but it’s a begin-
ning. If a man had perjured himself in (Say) a'
divorce-case and been convicted, he would have
got three years.
A Maoriland widow is suing one Waters
for .£2OO damages sustained through his having
transferred himself to her by marriage contract
when he was not negotiable, as it were, he being
at the time another woman’s lawful property.
Defendant, in trying to disprove damages, cruelly
drew attention to the fact that plaintiff was a
widow.
An association is being formed in Mel-
bourne “ for the Protection of Children.” H. H.
Champion takes a prominent part, and the other
movers are mostly wielders of the holy and insinu-
ating gimlet. Considering that these latter’s last
protegee was proved to be a designing minx of the
deepest dye, a society for the Protection of Lone
Man would seem more in order. Under exist-
ing conditions it certainly is not well for man
to be alone. A timid man can only breathe freely
when in the company of two female witnesses of
good character.
Gray, M.L.A. (Vic.), having stated at a
pious provincial bun-struggle that he knew M.’sP.
in Melbourne who had wives and families in one
suburb and kept a string of mistresses in another,
has been busy denying it ever since and insisting
that the Vie. M.P". is the very pink of propriety
and always goes straight home from church. One
reporter after another, however, has arisen to
confound the good Mr. Gray with his own words,
and the unfortunate statesman is in the unpleasant
position of having told the truth inadvertently or
by mistake. Meanwhile his friends are a sore
trial to him with their imitations of Elton asking
the way to the harem.
The Prince of Wales is again in town on
Sundays, The Bulletin rejoices to hear, there-
fore, H.R.H. has resumed “the delightful Bohe-
mian evenings which his friends delight to arrange
for him, at which the champagne is dry, the cigars
first-rate, the music light, and the ladies —if any
are present—are pretty.” If no ladies be present,
the yarns are beautiful, no doubt. Royal birth,
according to the theosophical Countess Wacht-
meister, is the outcome of a furious ambition for
power in the soul’s previous state. Brood over
ambitious designs, concentrate your thoughts upon
the possibilities of attaining to monarchy, and
half-a-century hence you may have a little mob of
loving subjects loading you up with dry cham-
pagne, choice cigars, ballet music and beauty’s
smiles every calm Sabbath evening that you care
to stop in town.
