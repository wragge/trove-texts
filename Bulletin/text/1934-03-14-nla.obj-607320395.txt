Literary Estimates
Most nineteenth-century studies of
literature have assumed that national
cultures are national ; even, to an ex-
tent, in their origins. Taine would admit
little more than that latter-day artists
don't operate on tabula rasa; that Cor-
neille and Voltaire had models which
EEschylus, say, lacked. In his “History
of English Literature,” which begins
with an explanation of why Latin culture
failed to influence the Anglo-Saxons, the
Englishism of English writers is always
his theme. He believed in it as he
believed that Moliere (the “god of
comedy” who happened to come down
in France) was essentially a seventeenth-
century Frenchman.
More and more in the past half-century
critics have been insisting on the inter-
nationalism of literature. Legouis and
Cazamian’s recently published History of
English Literature (Dent; 10s. 6d.) begins
with an affirmation that Anglo-Saxon is
distinct from English literature. French
mediaeval literature was the chief in-
spiration of English writers after the
Norman Conquest, and three centuries
later “its aesthetic character reappeared
almost in its entirety in Chaucer’s English
works.” Italian voluptuousness influenced
Shakspeare, Marlowe, even the chaste
Spenser (“The most beautiful passages of
the ‘Faerie Queene’ are impregnated with
it.”). Not till the end of the classical
period, and the appearance of a literature
of the middle classes, did the writers of
England become conspicuously English.
And less than a century later the begin-
nings and successive stages of the French
Revolution became “the predominant
factor in the mental outlook of political
theorists, polemical writers, novelists and
even dramatists and poets.”
A History of European Literature, by
the late Laurie Magnus (Nicholson and
Watson ; 12s. 6d.), is inevitably a fairly
complete history of English literature
from Chaucer (the Anglo-Saxon poets
and chroniclers are ignored) to Kipling
and Belloc. Magnus believed with Bryce
that “In history there is nothing isolated” ;
that every master, however minor, in
every age and clime forms a link in a
grand chain.
An Encyclopcedia
The Dent publication is amazing in
its scope. It contains 1500 pages, and
an index of about 1300 names. Poets
as humble as Ambrose Philips and as
recent as Siegfried Sassoon are men-
tioned. It is really two books in one:
Emile Legouis, the famous old professor
of the Sorbonne, deals with the “Middle
Ages and the Renascence” (650-1660),
and his colleague Louis Cazamian, who
knows England as well as Maurois, is
responsible for “Modern Times” (1660-
1932).
Taine classified the writers of Eng-
land by environment: in this study they
are grouped in movements, as a rule.
The authors remark in an introduction
that there is no danger of oblivion over-
taking Taine, but the fact is their work
will help to make him inacceptable to
those who wish to know how intellec-
tual England strikes foreigners of intel-
lect. It is not that Taine’s examination
stops at Tennyson; his point of view is
out of date. To most Continental critics
of 70 years ago Byron was, as Taine
wrote, “the greatest and most English
of these artists [Keats, Shelley, Wo.rds-
worth]; so great and so English that from
him alone we shall learn more truths of
his country than from all the rest to-
gether.” The English have always identi-
fied in Byron a strain of un-English ex-
hibitionism which is apparent to few
foreigners. Cazamian, the part-trans-
lator of his own writings, sees Byron
with English eyes.
A deep analogy affiliates Byron with the
spiritual posterity of Rousseau —with the
Goethe of “Werther,” the Chateaubriand of
“Rene” —making him in his turn one of the
most active generators of a mental con-
tagion At the very centre of his being
there is an element of morbidity; the inner
life built up on the
full indulgence of
emotion and desire
reveals one of its
current forms of its
possible disintegra-
tion: the dispersion
of the personality
through the absence of an organic discipline
among the motives and the acts.
All the major criticisms are equally en-
lightened ; they show a profound under-
standing of the English mind and char-
acter.
Internationalism of Culture
Laurie Magnus died last year without
seeing the proofs of his book. It is a
companion volume to the other; and,
indeed, to any study of English literature.
The thesis is epitomised in the opening
passage of the epilogue, which contrasts
the position of Keats, who “enjoyed the
freedom of Greece and Rome,” and of
Petrarch, who, five centuries before, had
to implore Boccaccio to find “someone,
however uncouth, to decipher his precious
manuscript of the ‘lliad.’ ” Boccaccio
was able to do so, and the Hellenists
gathered- in Florence at the Platonic
Academy under Lorenzo de’ Medici. If
they hadn’t we might not have had
Shakspeare; we would certainly have
had a different Shakspeare.
Boccaccio, who was born about 30
years before Chaucer, inspired the “Can-
terbury Tales” —an English “Decameron.”
Erasmus, the educator of Europe, arrived
in England at the end of the fifteenth
century ; and free thought and democ-
racy, which had been lost to the world
since the downfall of the Roman Repub-
lic, came to life again. Inside a century
the Reformation had arrived, and Milton
had written that it was “lawful to call
to account a wicked King, and, after
due conviction, to put him to death.”
The Reformation—the German Renas-
cence —“filled Europe with song and
story.” Shakspeare, Jonson and Mar-
lowe, Bacon, Sidney and Lyly appeared ;
the kind of novel Petronius had written
15 centuries earlier was reborn.
It began, so far as we know [in Spain], with
an anonymous life of “Lazarillo de Tormes,”
and this little Lazarus of 1554 ascended
through various phases to the characters created
by Lesage, Fielding. Dickens, and to Gogol’s
Chichikov in “Dead Souls”: a distinguished,
even a splendid, company.
The grand age of Spain was respon-
sible not only for the picaresque novel,
Calderon and De Vega, but for “Don
Quixote,” .the model for the satirical
works at which English writers of all
the succeeding centuries were to excel.
The French satirists took their tone from
it, too. The Hon. Mrs. Skewton (“Those
darling bygone times, with their delicious
fortresses, and their dear old dungeons,
and their delightful places of torture”),
some of Swift’s grimmest characters, and
almost any of Anatole France’s political
and religious rogues might have been
created by Cervantes. England and the
Continent came closer and closer together
culturally in spite of war. Pope wrote
in 1733: —
We conquered France, but felt our captive’s
charms;
Her arts victorious triumphed o’er our arms.
The foreigners have been winning in this
sense ever since. There is a complete
absence of what Saintsbury called “the
sharp national distinctions of the Middle
Ages”; and, though they may come into
being again, as in the last war, when the
Allies refused for a while to listen to
German music, it can only be for a
while. Culture has become as inter-
national as the air.

In Defence of the Novel
A reaction seems to have set in against
the novel in England. Perhaps the ascetic-
ism of Shaw, appalled at the number of
people in England who “dawdle their
lives away over novels,” has been re-
peated in this newer, more rigid genera-
tion. It is a studious age, an age in
which a literate democracy is eagerly de-
vouring what information it can get on
many subjects, from relativity to cur-
rency reform. To-day the man who wins
through is the man who marshals the
greatest number of facts; the man who
knows, not what was done last month,
but what was done last week. In such a
world the intellectual feels the novel to

MADE IN ENGLAND
be an intrusion upon lives which should
be devoted to the pursuit of knowledge.
In this attitude there is the remnant of
nineteenth-century opinion. “Novels are
sweets,” said Thackeray. In his day it
may have been true. The novel then
was “of quick interest, that hurried on
for incident and was for the eye to glide
over only.” The national genius, to
quote Gosse, had “gone into poetry.”
But to-day the English novel form has
widened past belief. It reaches out on the
one side to such works as “World of Wil-
liam Clissold” and on the other to the de-
liberate use of incoherence by Joyce. It
takes in history, philosophy, music,
psychology, social criticism. It can be
a tract for reform like “The Jungle,” a
biography like “Ariel,” propaganda for
arms like the almost-forgotten “Riddle
of the Sands,” an elaborate study of
genius in the manner of “Jean Chris-
tophe,” a re-creation of the sights and
sounds and odors of the past as “Java
Head,” sheer history like a great portion
of “Inheritance,” or the speculations of
a mind primarily philosophical, like
“These Barren Leaves.”
Dickens campaigned against boys’
schools and prison for debt, Disraeli used
the novel to forward his political faith,
Thackeray painted the society about him
as best he could. But none of them
dreamed of the possibility of making a
novel out of the career of a researen
worker like Martin Arrowsmith, a com-
poser like Lewis Dodd or of two such
people as Constance and Sophia Baines.
The scope of the novel is wider because
the world is wider. But that does not
alter the fact that the growth has taken
place. One has to be either ignorant or
snobbish to ignore it.
Perhaps the greatest single force in this
enrichment of the novel has been H. G.
Wells. Wells, who foresaw aviation, who
foresaw modern warfare with its tanks,
who predicted the effects of modern
methods of investment and was first to
appreciate the possibilities of modern
advertising, and who even hinted at an
approach to relativity, was pioneering for
the novel, too. He took the novel, not as
a work of art, but one capable of didac-
ticism ; he pleaded for a “wider discur-
siveness” and greater negligence towards
form and plot; he claimed that the novel
should embrace ethics, law and politics
within its borders, and that it should be
“the parade of morals and the exchange
of manners, <he factory of customs, the
criticism of laws and institutions and of
social dogmas and ideas.” It was to be
the function of the novelist not to teach
but “to discuss, point out, plead and dis-
play.” Wells himself did all these things,
sometimes with less satisfaction to writer
or reader than might have been, but with
considerable increase in reputation and
revelation of the possibilities of the novel
form.
To-day, therefore, the thousands of
books which pour from the presses annu-
ally bear on their tide some works which
the man or woman who is really anxious
to be part of the times in which he or she
lives cannot afford to ignore. It is mere
stupidity to escape into the past when
the present offers good things by really
outstanding writers and one really feels
that one learns something of England
from Huxley, of Europe from Wasser-
mann and Feuchtwanger, of America
from Sinclair Lewis and Dreiser. Not only
that, but the modern novel explores every
cranny of experience, every possibility of
mankind. An art which brings together
under the one heading such works as “The
Magic Mountain” and “Last and First
Men” is an art fully as entitled to atten-
tion as the subtlest irony of Mr. Keynes.
QUENTIN POPE.
Is Mankind Progressing?
“M.G.S.” (B. 7/3/’34) is sure it is. He
has
just read a biography of Lenin by Maxim
Gorky. Lenin might be described as an artist
who used society as his medium. He would
have been amused at the suggestion that human
nature can’t be changed. He punched the
Russian proletariat into a new shape.
But has his punching changed the Rus-
sian nature? There is no evidence, so
far, that he has done any more than a
thousand previous prophets, religious and
political, did for their followers. Every
successful prophet offers a new religion
and treats his followers like putty. The
followers become “changed men and
women,” as the saying goes. In the first
flush of enthusiasm they will believe in-
credible legends, face appalling hardships,
work, fight or die for the faith. Particu-
larly if it is a regional one which admits
of the introduction, as a spur, of foreign
heretics.
The slump comes when the priests
start to get rich, and the heretics start to
conform in large numbers. Indifferent-
ism is followed by anti-clericalism, and
it is revealed that the faithful are the
same people at heart as their unconverted
forebears were. Putty can be punched
into any shape that is required, but it
remains putty. The same with human
beings.
One reason why religions like Lenin-
ism don’t make people better is that
mass wickedness is never punished
in this world. A few authenticated
cases, such as that of the Cities of
the Plain, might make all the differ-
ence. As it is, we find that periods
of moral corruption, such as the reigns
of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, Charles
11. and the Regency, Louis XIV. and the
Directory (to name only a few), didn’t
lead to the downfall of the nations con-
cerned ; they led to nothing at all. The
Romans were never so corrupt as at the
end of the Republic ; the glories of the
Empire followed, and the Empire didn’t
fall till it had been Christianised.
Over and over again we see the same
phenomena repeated. A London paper
recently reported the conviction of six
West End fortune-tellers. Superstition is
thriving there at the expense of religion
as it did in the capital of another empire
which had reached the limits of the
world. Mrs. Smith, of Hertford-street,
W., and her kind fill the roles of Mithras,
of the Etruscan haruspex, and of the Chal-
dean with his horoscope. Week-enders
are deserting the churches as the Romans
did their temples.
Everything that has happened in
Russia since Lenin first started to “punch
the proletariat into a new shape” has
happened before —the enthusiasms; the
sense of self-righteousness; the belief
that for the first time in man’s muddled
existence a true faith, a genuine
happiness-bringer, has been found. This
latter-day Mahomet has already been
installed in his tomb. Millions of Rus-
sians file reverently past it every year.
In “First to Go Back,” the author, who
approves of the new regime, has a lyric
description of a military parade.
A host appears, carrying a sea of red banners.
Now the first battalion of infantry is passing
Lenin’s tomb. They are saluting Stalin with
heads and eyes to the right.... The parade is
now in full swing; aviation units, navy units,
machine-gun units Excellently trained, per-
fect discipline A battalion of women. They
look like men; they march like men.
Now the cavalry is appearing through the
Eastern Gate. Riding en masse they gallop
past us, the horses’ legs wrapped in red cloth.
.... There are hundreds, thousands; they fill
the whole square. They are followed by
motorised guns mounted on caterpillars; heavy
artillery....
Aeroplanes are flying low in perfect forma-
tion in squadrons of six.
“No air force can compare with ours,” a
Communist acquaintance says.
It will hardly be asserted, says
“M.G.5.,” “that old Rembrandt was not
a more developed individual than young
Rembrandt, and if that is not progress
we will have to exclude values from the
universe.” A master irrelevancy!
Races are like Rembrandt. They start
with child-minds, develop and die. Rem-
brandt left no successors to carry on
from the highest point at which he left
off. The human race is no more liable
to produce a Homer, an Apelles or an
Aristophanes than it was when the liter-
ate population of the world was less by
hundreds of millions. The modern
world has produced no nations which
are the moral and intellectual superiors
of some of the vanished civilisations of
antiquity. On the other hand, its capa-
city for producing morons who are ready
to march about with red flags and howl
defiance at imaginary foes remains un-
diminished, if it isn’t on the increase.

The Pope and the Painter
Although not of his faith, I am in
complete agreement with the Pope in
some remarks he made recently about
modern art when opening a new gallery
at the Vatican. He declared that modern
art merely caricatured and profaned
sacred things; that some people defended
modern art by saying that it represented
a search for something new, whereas it
merely revealed incapacity and unwil-
lingness to learn, and that in the presence
of the masterpieces of Giotto, Raphael
and Leonardo he was moved to contrast
their devout labors with the contemptu-
ous indifference to values of the modern-
ists.
A painter who does not discard tra-
dition but believes that one can only
build on it would say the same thing in
slightly different terms. He would say
that the sacred thing to him is truth, and
that Nature reveals the only truth with
which he is competent to deal in color,
tone and form. Before this revelation
he stands in the same relation as the
earnest theologian. In theological terms,
he sees Nature as the visual speech of
God. It is a language that he has to
learn, so that he can interpret it to his
fellowmen. Corot said, “I have spelt
out a few pages of a book with an in-
finite number of leaves.” He also sajd
that when he looked at Nature he was
filled with rage at his pictures. The
devout artist is thus one who is humbly
conscious of his ignorance. He does not
claim that Nature’s speech is already
known but that he has to find out what
it is.
This is the antithesis of the modern-
ist’s creed. The modernist professes a
complete contempt for natural truth, and
he expresses his contempt by deliberately
trying to make his pictures as unlike
Nature as possible. This is quite an easy
thing to do. A picture will be most un-
like Nature when it can be likened to
nothing but itself, or to some quite
arbitrary convention. An efficient means
of attaining this result would be to tie
a brush to a donkey’s tail, dip the brush
in buckets of various colors, back the
animal up against a canvas and let it do
its worst. This was done by some art
students in Paris. The result was given
a suitable title, hung in the Salon, and
greeted with rapturous applause by the
leading modernists. I am at one with
the custodian of St. Peter’s keys in re-
garding Titian’s brush directed by Titian’s
mind as more an instrument of God than
a donkey’s tail.

"Freedom" in Art
,
W.s belief (R.P. 21 2/34) that when
Percy Grainger enunciated his theory of
tree music he only meant that rules in
any art were made to be broken by the
courageous is erroneous. Grainger de-
finitely seeks the abolition ot the rules ot
harmony, rhythm and tonal intervals.
Admittedly Bach, Schumann, Beet-
hoven, Mozart and many other com-
posers showed a splendid disregard for
the current rules of harmony on occa-
sions. But they adhered so rigidly and
so capably to the accepted rules normally
that when they did flout them the result
justified the means. Few musicians to-day
understand the rules so thoroughly that
they can afford to break them with im-
punity; were they to do so the result
would certainly not be music.
Similarly, the laws governing rhythm
have been broken at times, but never for
more than two or three bars at a time, in
order to gain a certain effect. A fixed
tempo is the basic framework of all
music. It constitutes the inflexible guide
by which other people are enabled to
interpret the work of a composer. With-
out such a guide one shudders to imagine
the frightful attempts at interpretation
which would take place. Herschel Hen-
lere’s efforts to jazz up the classics would
be melodious in comparison,
As for tonal intervals, the music of
men who restricted themselves to 11 in-
tervals in the octave will live for genera-
tions after that of people who mess about
with 23 or 47 or even 95 intervals has
been relegated to limbo. Violinists play-
mg impromptu without keyed-instrument
accompaniment are not as free as the air.
Their C may not be quite the true C, but,
their D is exactly two intervals above it,
and they are restricted to 11 intervals to
the octave, just as definitely as the pianist
or the harpist.
. This free movement would be annoy-
mg, if it were not so ridiculous. It has
not been confined to music but its
a .dherents have sought to spread its per-
vicious influence through practically every
branch ot art.
We have had a surfeit of self-styled
P a '" ers “j? f ul P'° rs Wlth a ™ ss *"

they lacked both the application and the
ability necessary to master form.
If we must have “freedom,” let us have
it in full measure. Let us have free love,
and free beer, and, above all, free permis-
s j on t 0 cranks who think that by
doing a little bit of conjuring with the
conventions of art they can become
g reater than Beethoven and Rembrandt
anc j shakspeare.

REX G. RIENITS.
Memories (Mainly Merry ) of Marcus
Marks (Endeavour Press; 55.). Mr.
Marks was formerly Supervisor of “Han-
sard” and Government Printer in M.L.
He began as a comp, over half a century
ago, and he has set type since then in
a good many parts of Australasia, includ-
ing Sydney (John Sands and the “Tele-
graph”) and Melbourne (“Age”). But
he was born in Wellington (M.L.); his
heart was always in his native islands,
and most of his best stories are about
M.L. celebrities. His book is as read-
able as it is original in form ; many of his
anecdotes only run to half a page, and
few extend to more than one page. The
stories are interesting as revelations of
character (his character); they are well
freighted with dry, terse wit, and there
isn’t a half-ounce of malice in the entire '
collection.

BACK TO BRUCE.
Australian politics are so chaotic that
the friends of Fascism and of Stalinism
may well be jubilant. Federal Labor and
Lang Labor have been wrangling for
years, and their latest “unity” con-
ference nearly collapsed on the first
day. The U.A.P. and Country party
are on the edge of more dogfights.
Every week or so the C.P. in Vic-
toria threatens to withdraw its repre-
sentatives from the Melbourne Minis-
try. Mr. Lyons has just emerged from a
“you-did-I-didn’t” schoolgirl bicker with
Dr. Earle Page, who has retired to the
fastnesses of the Upper Clarence, leaving
him the field. Over Perth hangs a thin
mist of hate through which rises the voice
of Collier defying the Federal octopus.
He is a secessionist there ; he demanded
more Federal grants-in-aid in Melbourne,
and he came on to Sydney to strive for
party unity and Australian unification.
In Melbourne with this versatile West-
ralian were heaps of other Premiers,
Cabinet Ministers, heads of departments,
“expert .advisers” and secretaries—l3o
altogether. The visitors have all departed,
though why some of the politicians did
not stay in Melbourne was a puzzle. Judg-
ing by their subsequent leisure for invec-
tive there was no work to bring them
home, and had they remained the
sight of each other would have stimu-
lated their vocabularies. Forgan Smith
may be excepted. He was the one confer-
ence casualty—he is suffering from an
illness which has been accentuated by his
own party worries. Others still strain at
their leashes, and snarl out pronounce-
ments which would be voted tactless in
the lower forms of a girls’ school.
Mr. Stevens celebrated his return by
attending a gathering staged in a safe
U.A.P. electorate, there to announce that
he is all for N. S. Wales and a firm ally
of Canberra. The audience sang “For
He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,” and Mr.
Dunningham said that “the press had
got the proceedings of the Premiers’ con-
ference from the wrong angle.” It is
possible, since it would have needed an
infra-red microscope to discover enough
straight lines in the thing to form an
angle. If Mr. Dunningham had said “the
wrong spike” it would have been better,
since what the conference resembled
most in nature was a prickly-pear leaf off
which every Premier leapt with a yell.
Mr. Stevens, of course, was the least
noisy. He has shown better leadership
than the others. His relations with the
Country party remain friendly ; his own
party’s faith in him seems unshaken and
he appears to be trying earnestly to do
his job.
The other Premiers gained nothing in
Melbourne. Mr. Stevens bore away
Loan Council authority for the establish-
ment of a body to get unemployment
loans for more sewers and the like. That
will help him in N. S. Wales electorates,
but Edward Mitchell, K.C., denounces
it as an evasion of the Financial Agree-
ment. W. A. Leitch, chairman of the
Victorian Associated Banks, says that
“if the electors permit such a thing
an orgy of borrowing can be looked for.”
It is refreshing to read this reference to
the electors. Nobody else seems to have
remembered them, or recalled that our
system of government, such as it is, is
based on their ultimate right to settle their
own problems. The average Premier, if
he has a conception of their status in the
current dogfight, sees them only as admir-
ing spectators of his antics.
Mr. Lyons could get the views of the
electors on a definite plan of constitu-
tional reform ; and he is beginning to
talk about it, as a year ago he talked
about summoning a constitutional con-
vention. But this mild Tasmanian
is the last man to do it, or, apparently, to
vision what the future holds for him. Yet
every day makes it more evident that
the enlargement of national powers will
be the main issue at the next Common-
wealth election, and that the screaming
medley of State branches which func-
tion as a Federal U.A.P. may find itself
at the polls with a series of provincial
policies tied to its tail. Every day, too,
it is becoming more clear that Mr. Lyons
will be an impossible leader in the fight
which is brewing. He declared for
general reduction of taxation as the
meaqs of restoring prosperity—and his
expenditure is heavier than last year. His
party is at sixes and sevens. His Parlia-
mentary followers do not even know
when they will be called together. No-
body retains any confidence in him, and
the moment seems ripe to suggest again
that he should step down and let Mr.
Bruce take his place.
Mr. Bruce at least would have a policy,
and he would achieve agreement with Dr.
Page, who was his associate for nearly seven
years. Moreover he has inspired good-
will and confidence overseas in quarters
where in September, 1931, people were
advised to take what they could get for
Australian stocks, and N. S. Wales 5 per
cents, sold at £46 7s. 6d. On occasions
he has been wrong ; but he at least has
strength and self-reliance. He would give
Australia leadership, and Mr. Lyons
can’t.
LET ROOSEVELT STUDY US!
Franklin D. Roosevelt is master of one
peculiar art —that of keeping the world
guessing wrong. His usual procedure
seems to be to wait till all the recognised
prophets have spoken and then to con-
found them with some scheme which out-
runs their worst fears.
In January the usually well-informed
Samuel G. Blythe prophesied that the
forthcoming U.S.A. Budget would keep
expenses down so as to provide a surplus
of £200,000,000 for debt-reduction. While
the “Saturday Evening Post,” in which
this cheerful forecast was printed, was on
the way to the bookstalls, Mr. Roosevelt
stole a march on it and its congeners
(after a Congressional message which
said exactly nothing) with a set of
schemes which included the floating
within six months of ten thousand mil-
lion dollars, the biggest peace-time loan
in history, three-fifths of it to be ear-
marked for national-recovery measures.
Brigaded with this embarrassing gift for
posterity was a three-year plan which
will add to a national debt already nearly
doubled since 1929 a new deficit of
£1,460,000,000 this year, and a further
one of £400,000,000 next year. In 1936
the Budget is to be balanced, and the
wretched taxpayers, whose national in-
come has fallen more than 50 per cent,
in four depression years, will carry the
accumulation as a permanent cross or
pay it off, which looks like a long job.
For immediate digestion by Wall-street
and the captains of commerce, the Pre-
sident announced a scheme of dollar
devaluation, linked with the establish-
ment of an exchange-stabilisation fund
financed by the commandeering of gold.
Since then there has been an intensified
labor policy of shorter hours and higher
wages designed to shift unemployment
from public to private shoulders. It
is a highly attractive programme to those
who won’t have to pay for it, or think
they won’t, and the effect on the con-
stituencies will be great. But three-fifths
of a dollar insists on being three-fifths
of a dollar, even when you call it a
dollar, as the exchange market has since
proved. Hence, unless the higher wages
meet the currency devaluation, they may
still be raised considerably and yet leave
the worker worse off than he was when
the dollar was worth 4s. 2d. in our
money. A reduction of the forking
week to 30 hours is now talked of. It
is merely the equivalent of what we call
“rationing.”
The nationalisation of the gold supply
is armor against both the internal and
external speculator. It has been sewn
up with a rigid system of licensing and
control of Stock Exchanges which goes
so far as to permit the White House to
oust members of Stock Exchange boards
of which it does not approve. It was not
received with enthusiasm by the thrifty.
They preferred their gold to the dollar
certificates which they received in ex-
change, and which are non-redeemable,
non-circulating and not based on gold—
just paper money.
The House of Representatives passed
the Gold Bill by 360 votes to 40 ; but the
Senate proved more difficult to deal with.
Following the recommendation of its
Banking Committee, it insisted on plac-
ing exchange control in the hands of a
board, and on limiting to three years the
period during which the President may
play with dollar devaluation. It is
probable that American citizens and the
world will have to thank the Senate.
Even yet the stunned Americans do not
seem to have realised how close and
universal a dictatorship has been estab-
lished over U.S.A. overseas trade and
financial relations, and there might have
been a very different reaction in coun-
tries whose war-debt contributions are
now in arrears £60,000,000 —if British
and Italian token payments are excluded
—had the scheme gone through in its
original form.
As it was, the new Roosevelt dollar
seems to have ruffled only the newspapers
in European financial centres, though per-
haps the existence of an alleged secret
agreement between London, New York
and Paris, now reported, has had some-
thing to do with this.
Had the New Deal emanated from
London, it would have shaken the world
from end to end. In London, actually, it
“caused scarcely a ripple” except .a
mechanical growth in the demand for
the new dollars and a gradual exchange
adjustment. The attitude of the elderly
gentlemen who put on their tailcoats to
address bank meetings in London every
January is tolerant. Their stand in gen-
eral is that the New Deal calls for no
enthusiasm, but that its failure would
cause a disaster which would react severely
against British investments. However,
Britons are more interested in that
unobtrusive phenomenon the British Re-
covery Plan. It was born without trum-
peting, and has been living a quiet but
profitable life, unmentioned save when
the Rooseveltian propaganda is not long
enough to quite fill the column, under
the sober guardianship of the Bank of
England, which is as disinterested as any
President, and far more stable and ex-
perienced in these matters.
Everybody seems to agree that it is
doing what it set out to do. Regi-
nald McKenna, chairman of the Midland
Bank, and a war-time Chancellor of the
Exchequer, declared that the monetary
policy signed at the close of the World
Economic Conference by representatives
of almost every part of the Empire has
succeeded
in maintaining the general average of
prices at a level which renders production
profitable.
He added that it would be falsely opti-
mistic to expect an immediate return to
prosperity, and that it was too early to
revive a universal world currency. At
the same time, the “trend was unmistak-
ably upwards, and the worst of the Em-
pire’s troubles have been surmounted.”
F. C. Goodenough, chairman of Bar-
clay’s Bank, said there had been steady
improvement, the future was hopeful,
and it was an opportune moment to de-
velop inter-Empire trade, since “it should
be possible for Great Britain to do more
for the Dominions in the way of finding
capital for future development.” That
doesn’t sound like depression!
The optimism of these men is backed
by figures. The index-value of Govern-
ment securities in London stood 6.5 p.c.
higher in 1933 than in 1932 and 16.5
points higher than in 1926. Home rail-
way stocks —a crucial index—doubled in
value between December, 1932, and the
end of January, 1934. Rubber shares in-
creased in value an average of 300 p.c.
in the same period, and all industrials
together 21 p.c.—they are four points
higher than the 1926 level in spite of con-
siderably lower wholesale prices, which
seem to be restrained by the limits of
national and world spending power.
U.S.A. industrials in New York are four
points lower than in 1926. The adverse
British trade balance has been improved
by £147,000,000 in a single year, and the
British Treasury has reduced its accumu-
lated deficits of £180,000,000 by about
£100,000,000 in the same period, and can
afford to retire large amounts of Trea-
sury bills. An issue of £105,000,000 at
4 p.c. will be prematurely redeemed in
April, apparently on money acquired on
10-15-year currency loans at 2\ p.c. last
September. The demand for investment
money is so strong that rates seem to
have reached their limit of cheapness—
any change in them will be upwards.
And what Britain has done Australia
is doing in concert with her. Both are
a couple of years ahead of Mr. Roose-
velt in the race for recovery. He seems
to be only at the stage which we reached
at the end of 1931. Instead of Mr.
Stevens sending junior statisticians to
study the Roosevelt plan, Mr. Roosevelt
might well send a few experts to study
ours.
WINES AND NAMES.
American experts have tasted our wines
and pronounced them good, particularly
the samples of port and burgundy ex-
hibited at the New York show. Their
favorable verdict doubtless influenced the
decision of their Government to increase
the Australian wine quota for March and
April to 100,000 gallons. But obstacles to
the development of a trade beneficial to
both countries will arise if the U.S.A. has
authorities as stupid as the English magis-
trate who fined a retailer for selling Yal-
umba “sherry.” Australia will have to
stand out for the right to use such names
as “champagne,” “burgundy,” “port” and
“sherry” when the International Union
for the Protection of Industrial Property
has its meeting in May.
There is no case in reason, equity or
tradition for the names-monopoly in
wines which is claimed by France
and Portugal. For example, the French
export “biere” (Ang., “beer”: A.-Sax.,
“beor”). England has never objected, and
the French would have ignored an objec-
tion if it had been lodged. The French
have for generations been selling some
of their light beer as Pilsener. When
Czecho-Slovakia, heartened by the re-
gional claims of France in the wine field,
argued recently that, as the possessor of
Pilsen, it had a right to a monopoly of
the name, the French agreed and offered
to back their allies. It was as safe—and
as disingenuous as the offer made
by Russia some years ago to disarm if
all the other nations would follow suit.
Every beer-drinking country in the world
makes Pilsener, and means to go on
doing so.
The chief objection to giving a mono-
poly of world-famous liquor appellations
to any one country is that the inevitable
effect would be to flood the world with
inferior liquor. The original whisky
countries (Scotland and Ireland) have
never asked for the sole right to the
Gaelic name “whisky.” They rely for
their export trade on turning out a more
attractive article than their competitors.
Portugal, under the Anglo-Portuguese
Commercial Treaty, has an exclusive
right to sell “port” in Britain. “Port”
means wine grown in the Douro district.
Actually, much of the “port” consumed
in Britain is Lisbon, as any knowledgable
patron of a London bodega will testify.
In cheaper resorts all over the U.K. mix-
tures are retailed as port which contain
neither port nor Lisbon. This is the boot-
leg stuff which every country that goes in
for any form of liquor restriction is
bound to be afflicted with in time.
France had the right kind of mono-
poly—particularly in regard to cham-
pagne, cognac, claret and burgundy —till
about quarter of a century ago: a mono-
poly of merit. The vignerons of the
classic wine-districts used to laugh at the
pretensions of overseas wine-makers who
had neither the right soil nor the right
climate, nor the proper technical
methods. Australia was the first to
appear as a serious rival. Australian
clarets, burgundies and hocks began to
establish themselves in many parts of
Europe as quality wines over a decade
ago. A few years later nearly all the
Australians who wanted champagne were
asking for the Australian product.
Meanwhile Australian ports and sherries
were improving fast.
If most of the ports and alleged ports
imported to Britain in the past half-
century were inferior, the overseas stuff
brought into this country was awful.
Nowadays few Australians drink the Lis-
bon which is still sold in a few clubs and
hotels as port. It is safe to say that not
one Australian in 10,000 ever so much as
tastes the French wines which so
popular throughout the Commonwealth
before the war; and French wines are
going out of favor in Britain. A reason
is that they are not what they were. It is
notorious that wines from Syria, Algeria
and Morocco are blended nowadays with
the produce of France, and sold abroad
as French.
If other countries are debarred from
calling their wines by recognisable names
they will lose vast sums while wine-
drinkers are accustoming themselves to
the new names. The monopoly countries
will be in a position during that period
to exploit their rivals as France is now
exploiting its African colonies — i.e., as
cheap-wine reservoirs. It would be a
calamity for the beverage-drinking world
and, in the long run, for France and Por-
tugal themselves. Those countries can
only survive as Scotlands of the wine
trade by producing and exporting the
best in fairly open competition, and by
satisfying consumers everywhere that
their products are best because they are
entirely French or Portuguese, as the case
may be.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Lang Laughs at Disunity.
It doesn’t worry Lang and Garden that
the latest Labor “unity” conference has
failed. The only kind of unity they want
is the kind achieved between the shark
and the bait. If the other sections of
Labor will turn themselves into inert
hunks of political meat which the Lang-
sters can swallow, after discarding any
dead bones of moderation which are
likely to interfere with a Red Socialist’s
digestion, so much to the good. Whether
or not, the wild men of Goulburn-street
are happy.
They feel that the odds are in their
favor. If Lyons does not come off his
pedestal, or if the U.A.P. does not secure
leadership which the C.P. will accept,
they expect to see the non-Labor parties
come back from the constituencies either
inferior in numbers to the Labor factions
or with a paper majority which, failing
agreement, will be untrustworthy and un-
workable. In such a situation, the game
will be in the hands of the most daring
and most unscrupulous Labor section.
There is no doubt about which one
that will be.
Beasley in 1931 showed his willingness
and ability to smash a weak Labor Gov-
ernment. His faction, with Lang at its
head, would delight in throwing its weight
where it would paralyse or slaughter a
U.A.P. Administration. Then the Scullin
group would have to support a Lang-
Beasley Government. Unless the U.A.P.
and C.P. agree to cease disagreeing and
are returned with an absolute joint majo-
rity which will allow them to work to-
gether, as they work in N.S.W. State poli-
tics, there may be years of disaster ahead
for the Commonwealth. As Mr. Lyons
seems incapable of achieving agreement,
the situation now doubly calls for Mr.
Bruce’s guiding hand.
Sold Up for Rates.
The Bulletin knows a Digger who
returned from the wars to discover that
some jack-in-office had fined him for not
sending in an income-tax return during
his absence. Another A.I.F. man who
used to be mayor of the Perth suburb
of Victoria Park learned, when he came
back, that, because he owed rates
on four blocks of land, the City Coun-
cil had sold them for £2O, a fraction of
their value —the successful bidder was
a Nationalist politician. In Perth again
after many years, the landless war-
rior has put in a claim for compensation
which the council will find it hard to
wriggle out of, especially if it is true, as
asserted, that the forced sale was held a
month before the Postponement of Debts
Act ran out.
Another forced sale for unpaid rates
is now presumably engaging the attention
of Spooner, N!S.W. Minister for Local
Government. It came out in the Equity
Court last week that the Kogarah Council
had at the beginning of 1929 put up
three cottages at Newtown and five
acres of land at Tom Ugly’s Point,
the property of an eccentric old rate-
payer, now deceased, and accepted a bid
of £20 —an odd coincidence. The bidder
was “George West Leighton, Town Clerk
of Kogarah, acting for himself.” Declar-
ing that the places were worth £2200, the
late owner’s sister asked the Court to
set aside the sale, and, after some well-
chosen remarks by Justice Long Innes,
the case was settled on terms not pub-
lished ; but unless all the energy has
oozed out of Spooner, the matter will
not end there.

The Disarmament Dud.
Nothing has been mentioned in recent
cablegrams about “Uncle Arthur” Hen-
derson’s Disarmament Conference, but it
is vaguely understood that the Sydney
ladies who celebrated its first anniversary
last year are arranging another little
birthday party. At the other end of the
world hopes that anything good would
come out of the conference or the
copious note-issue which has accompanied
its discussions have been abandoned.
Sir John Simon, the British Foreign
Secretary, whose position in the Ministry
is shaky, wrote a beautiful memoran-
dum on disarmament and arranged for
Captain Eden, the Lord Privy Seal, to
deliver it at Paris, Berlin and Rome and
engage in chatty communications on the
subject. At Berlin the visitor was told that
Germany had a “minimum” programme
for bringing its armaments to a level
with those of other Great Powers, and
would not budge an inch from it. At
Paris he was complimented by the
Foreign Secretary, M. Barthou, but was
politely told that he could consider the
Simon memorandum rejected. Musso-
lini was conciliatory, as always these
days, and the missionary was gratified to
learn that Italy is building no cruisers
this year.
Brussels was not visited ; but from that
city the author of the disarmament
memorandum received a rude shock.
The Prime Minister, Comte de Broque-
ville, said in the Senate that the makers
of the Treaty of Versailles had been
“under a great illusion” when they
thought to keep the Germans disarmed ;
that Germany was no longer a van-
quished country, but had recovered her
strength and importance—was, in fact,
entitled to rearm.
Belgium is prepared to accept the re-
armament of Germany. To wage a preven-
tive war would be worse than the evil the
treaty sought to cure. I refuse to launch
Belgium on such an adventure.
This from the country which felt the first
blow in 1914, and whose soldiers marched
alongside the French into the Ruhr!
In the sober mood produced by the
drastic change in Belgian policy, the
House of Commons considered the Army
and Navy estimates. There is to be no
addition to the Army, but three millions
is to be added to the naval expenditure,
making it 56| millions. The new pro-
gramme provides for the construction of
four cruisers, eight destroyers and three
submarines, among other vessels. It
does not seem much considering how
feverishly the Americans and Japanese
are building (the Japanese, their Naval
Department has given out, aim at having
6y 1939 six battleships, six aircraft-
carriers, 37 cruisers, 97 destroyers and
40 submarines) ; and when the Air Force
estimates, showing an increase of a mere
£135,000 to \l\ millions, were reached,
the Government was attacked from all
sides. Defending itself, it explained that
expenditure on air armaments had been
deliberately limited for 15 years in the
hope of securing a general agreement on
those lines. It would start “next morn-
ing” to seek a convention “limited to the
countries of Western Europe.” The
amiable Baldwin said that, and he con-
cluded :
If all our efforts fail, the Government
will see that in air strength Britain shall
no longer be inferior to any country
within striking distance of our shores.
Meantime, the Old Man has placed “a
substantial order” for Tiger Moths,
which can “carry comprehensive mili-
tary loads and perform every manoeuvre
in the repertory of the service
pilot.” Australia ought to place a
substantial order for these machines, or
for others more suitable if there are any
about, on its own account. Clearly it
can no longer afford to indulge in the
fond dream which moved its last Govern-
ment to declare for practical disarma-
ment and express its unfaltering confi-
dence in the League of Nations.

A New Financial Plan.
“El V.”: Mr. O’Keefe, M.L.A. for
Cairns, is deeply concerned because
North Queensland members have been'
approached by gambling bodies which
desire immunity from prosecution. He
thinks that the authorities “should take
some action,” and that “foreigners who
stoop to such practices should be de-
ported.” It seems that a gentleman called
on Mr. O’Keefe and asked for a letter
of introduction to the Police Commis-
sioner. Mr. O’Keefe replied that neither
he nor Labor stood for organised
gambling.
Most people who see the way the wind
is blowing will agree with Mr. O’Keefe
that the time is ripe for action. The first
step should be for Mr. Stevens in N. S.
Wales to take a census of southern agents
of that gilded haunt of chance the
Golden Brisket office, which pushes its
operations into States where the very
whispering of its name for practical pur-
poses is forbidden. Then Mr. O’Keefe s
deportation system should be put into
operation—but not in Queensland, which,
for export purposes, might be declared
“foreign” by the other States —thus com-
bining a good clean-up with a new immi-
gration policy for the North.
If all the people who are now selling
tickets in Mr. Forgan Smith’s lottery in
N. S. Wales at the solicitation of the
Golden Whats-its-name office were sent
over the Macintyre the population ol:
Queensland would double in a fortnight.
And if the N. S. Wales Government made
a point of making them pay railway
fares and freight rates on their posses-
sions—which naturally also would be
deported—the N. S. Wales railway deficit
would be wiped out; in fact, there would
be a surplus that would enable Mr.
Stevens to throw overboard his new
sewerage scheme, adopt the Douglas sys-
tem and give all the unemployed £3OO
a year each for life, so that they could
go on selling more Forgan Smith cer-
tificates and being more and more de-
ported.
Reciprocity might be established with
the Queensland authorities. When the
deportees reached Queensland they
would certainly show their chancy
natures by buying Mr. Stevens’s tickets
occasionally instead of the local ones,
and Mr. Forgan Smith could then re-
deport them southward, a process which
would settle his transport deficit for good
and all.
Foreigners of the overseas type should,
of course, be declared “black.” But there
would be no need to deport them. All
that would be necessary would be to
direct the flood of southern lawbreakers
to suitable areas, such as Cairns and
Gordonvale, and there would soon be
no room there for a Chinaman to park
a fan-tan table.
I think that Mr. Smith and Mr. Stevens
should combine to introduce this scheme
to the next Premiers’ conference. It is
quite as sound as some of the other
schemes put before the last conference.
I suggest that it should be known as the
Whiddon Plan to perpetuate the name
of a founder who already seems to rank
with John Macarthur and Farrer as one
of the Fathers of Australia.
—
Action and Wheat.
The Commonwealth Wheat Commission
looks more capable of arriving at con-
structive decisions than the Government
that appointed it. It includes Herbert
Gepp, an able industrial organiser ;
E. P. M. Sheedy, an experienced account-
ant ; the Victorian Professor Wadham
and knowledgeable W.A. and S.A. repre-
sentatives.
The main facts it has to face are
not purely local ones. There happens to
be a world of distressed growers and dis-
satisfied consumer-countries (some of
them now growing wheat themselves)
outside the three-mile limit. The figures
of any big financial institution should
tell the inquirers all they want to know
about the farmer’s plight. Overseas
conditions they can gauge from expert
summaries and market forecasts just as
accurately as they could do by any ex-
pedient short of a world tour.
The troubles of the industry have a
reaction upon the whole prosperity of
Australia. No ephemeral solution can
adequately cure them. What is needed,
as the chairman has said, is a “Premiers’
plan for wheat.” An incomplete handling
of the situation certainly might tide us
over the present year, but might leave
us worse off next season ; and a per-
manent solution which involves the trans-
fer of wheat lands to other uses would
not be hurriedly operable. In any case, it
might simply saddle us with one more
land industry which would have presently
to raise its voice with wheat and dairy
produce in an anguished cry for rescue.
The subsidiary concerns of the Bank
of England and the British Agricultural
Ministry have handled puzzles equally
difficult in moribund British industries.
There seems to be no reason why their
success cannot be repeated with Austra-
lian wheat,, even allowing for our addi-
tional difficulties which arise from our
being a small and remote supply-source
in world terms.
The most disturbing element of the
situation is the airiness with which Mr.
Lyons and his henchmen treat it. Parlia-
ment should be ready to sit instantly to
discuss wheat and inter-State finance the
moment the two problems are ripe for
treatment. But it is announced that, on
civil-service advice, there will be no
meeting till supply is needed at the end
of June.

To Hang or Not to Hang.
Henry Bateson has his say:
I don’t dispute the facts of the Glenore Grove
murder or the inferences drawn from those facts
(B. 28/2/’34), but the question of capital punish-
ment should not be judged on a single isolated
case.
Certainly the slayers of Clarice Murphy
selected Queensland as the scene of their foul
crime because it is a non-hanging State. But, to
my mind, she would have died as she did if no
State had abrogated the death penalty. The case
is no argument against the abolition of capital
punishment, save inasmuch as Queensland tax-
payers now have to pay for the keep of two
murderers who, had the law been uniform in
both N.S.W. and Queensland, would have been
tried, convicted and gaoled or executed, as the
case might be, in the Ma State.
It is true that a life sentence means nothing,
since a softhearted Minister may release the
offender long before his sentence has expired,
but what about mushy Executive Councils?
Most death sentences are commuted, thus pav-
ing the way for the premature release by soihe
sloppy Minister of the convicted murderer.
Bennett’s case was mentioned. He was given
a life sentence for outraging a child, was re-
leased after a few years, committed other
crimes, and finally dangled from a Victorian
gallows. Had he been hanged for his first crime,
he would not have committed his subsequent
offences. That’s obvious, but had the death
penalty operated for outrage in Westralia would
he not, in an effort to prevent identification,
have added murder to his first crime? When
the death penalty attaches to rape, robbery with
violence, or any other aggravated offence, it is
a direct encouragement to the commission of
murder, as is borne out by criminal statistics
from every part of the world.
I’m no sloppy sentimentalist, but I realise
that the arguments for and against capital pun-
ishment break even. The death penalty is effica-
cious as a deterrent only when it is certain.
The Ma State is proof of this; for, leaving out
foreign feuds among the polyglot population
of the North, non-hanging Queensland, on a
population basis, has fewer murders annually
than N.S.W. So I say, have death or life im-
prisonment as the penalty for murder, but
whichever you adopt make it certain, and per-
mit of no interference by sloppy Executive
Councils or mushy Ministers. It can be done
either by giving the trial Judge a freer hand, or,
if the responsibility is too great for one man,
by forcing juries to convict for first- or second-
degree murder. Hang, and hang every time,
cold-blooded fiends of the Noon and Deeming
type; gaol, and gaol for the full 15 or 20 years,
murderers less remorseless for whom some
extenuating circumstances can be found. It is
the certainty of punishment, the knowledge that
detection is sure and that there will be no re-
mission of the penalty, which is the greatest de-
terrent, and it is exactly in this direction that
Australian justice fails to-day. But I would
limit capital crimes to treason and murder; for
to make rape, robbery with violence or armed
burglary capital is to invite criminals to
perpetrate the additional crime of murder.
Marriage and Divorce.
“Pa wang” : The reason why discussions
on divorce, such as that at the Premiers’
conference in Melbourne, never come to
anything is that there are two irrecon-
cilable factors in the case. The civil
attitude is gradually tending towards the
idea that matrimonial laws should con-
form to biological realities. This would
tend to take the matter out of the hands
of politicians and deliver it over to the
scientists. The churches’ attitude is that
they should conform to God’s will, as
interpreted by the different denomina-
tions. This also takes the matter out of
the hands of the politicians and delivers
it to the theologians. The politicians are
consequently torn between two opposing
ideals and never get anywhere. A com-
promise I would suggest is that the
churches be allowed to make marriage
laws for their own members, provided
they did not interfere with the liberty of
others.
S. H. PRIOR MEMORIAL PRIZE
To recognise the services to Australian literature of the late Samuel
Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £lOO per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain all property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which
will not be opened until the judges have made their decision.
The judges’ selections will be final, and competitors must accept as
binding the trustees’ decisions on other matters arising out of the contest.
The trustees, whose address is 252 George-street, Sydney, reserve the
right to withhold the prize if no novel submitted is, in the opinion of the
judges, worthy of an award.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“El V.”: At this year’s Sydney Elec-
trical and Radio Exhibition a feature was
made of domestic gadgets, and, to attract
the fair to look at stoves, the committee
installed a “sex-appeal machine,” which
tells exactly how much “it” each lady
possesses. The result was that thousands
of young things passed every stove and
iron in the place with no more than a
scornful glance and made straight for the
love register, and (if possible) the guinea
held out as a bait. The night I was there
a large audience of anxious flappers stood
breathless lest a much-advertised movie
actress should fail to qualify as a man-
trap. The only sure gauge for that sort
of thing is human. Next year, if it wants
to make a real test, the committee itself
should line up and discover its effect on
the feminine heart. If it looks like the
average business men’s executive, the test
will be real.

“No-Hatter”: We of the Lidless Legion

out of our calm by the insults of the
president of the Hatters’ Union, who has
suggested that we should be scorned as

an Australian industry. If we were pro-
pagandists we might counter with an
incident which occurred recently in Syd-
ney. A boisterous wind blew off the hat
of a tram passenger and hurled it right
into the face of the driver of a passing
motor. The latter lost control of his car,
which swerved and tried to climb aboard
another. Three people went to hospital
and two cars to the repair-shop, all
because of the pernicious habit of hat-
wearing.

“Smike”: Whatever may be the result
of this Yanco Welfare Farm inquiry, one
amazing thing has come out. It has long
been the practice at this establishment to
hand over lads who have absconded and
been recaptured to what is known as the
“court-martialling” process, trial and
punishment by their fellows. The
punishment mostly consists of the cul-
prit having to fight one boy after another
until he should cry enough. There is
assuredly no prison in the Empire where
this sort of thing would be tolerated.

“Turl”: A telegram from Westralia
says that a nomad at Pilbarra recently
drowned himself in the Oak-
over River ; also that “nothing
was known of his history, the
only clue having been his Eng-
lish university accent.” It isn’t
much of a clue. The “Isis” has
declared that the miscalled
Oxford accent is emphatically
not a product of Oxford and
indeed is never heard there,
although there are numerous
places—London particularly—
in which it can be heard.
Hence the fact that a man
spoke with what somebody in
Australia regarded as an Eng-
lish university accent might
waken instant suspicion that
he wasn’t a university man. As
an Oxonian over 40 years ago,
I may say that I have never
succeeded in identifying any
fellow-alumnus by the alleged Oxford
accent, or, indeed, in discovering of what
it consists.

“Gilbert de Sleuth”: A man who has
spent the best part of a lifetime in the
service of a legal firm told me his queer-
est experience of how a man established
his identity. Thirty years ago a woman
quarrelled bitterly with her husband;
next morning he left her, taking with him
their only son, a boy of five. She never
heard from or saw either again. When
she was dying she instructed her two
daughters to try to locate them, as she
wanted them to share in her estate. The
two men were advertised for all over
Australia ; and one day a sunburnt bush-
man turned up at the lawyer’s office and
claimed to be the missing son ; his father
had died years before. But he had no-
thing whatever by which he could be
identified, and although the two women
questioned him at length they could elicit
nothing to satisfy them of his identity
Wasn’t there a single thing of his home
life that he could recall? Yes, there was
one thing, he admitted at last, a trifle
shamefacedly. “I remember my mother
smoking a pipe in the kitchen and hastily
putting it out of sight whenever she heard
someone coming, and eating a pepper-
mint.” His two sisters declared that was
sufficient; he was their missing brother
beyond all doubt. Their mother had
smoked a pipe in the house, but kept her
little vice such a close secret that not
even her closest friends ever suspected it.

“Chevroford”: Wellington - parade,
Melbourne, where cars pile themselves
up on safety beacons with monotonous
regularity, could be made safe for pedes-
trians and petrol vehicles so simply that
it is a wonder a proposal at present being
considered hasn’t occurred to anybody
before. The suggestion is to line the
tram-tracks along their whole length with
concrete-bordered lawns and shrubs up
to the safety zones. This would effectu-
ally prevent any more melancholy mas-
sacres which have been due to drivers
overhauling others, to the detriment of

“Wealsman”: Incredible as it may
seem, there are still Tasmanians who
resent any reference
to the island as “The
Speck.” This very
day, on our suburban
tram, we were discuss-
ing the everlasting
subject of the State’s
disabilities and the
Common wealth’s
hard-fistedness, when
a prominent citizen
butted in with “Aw,
what do the big main-
land States care about
us? They treat us
with contempt. Why,
their papers habitu-
ally refer to Tasmania
as the Speck! Dam’
insult, I call it.” His
indignation was so
genuine that we man-
aged to restrain our
laughter till he left the
tram, after which the
conversation turned to
the origins of apt nick-
names, and The Bul-
letin received its
share of notice. But
Tasmania was referred
to as a speck long be-
fore The Bulletin
came into existence.
The first novel pub-
lished in Hobart,
“Quintus Servinton,”
by Henry Savery, is
dated 1830, and
the preface contains
an expression of satis-
faction that, owing to “the extra-
ordinary progress made in this little speck
upon the Southern Ocean, it is found
easily practicable to print and publish an
octavo work in Van Diemen’s Land.”

“The Dip”: Whoever killed George
Washington Nott, the 6ft. 4in. Digger of
Pilliga (N.S.W.), and burned the body
overlooked, or was ignorant of, the fact
that enamel doesn’t burn ; and so in the
ashes of the fire teeth were found, enab-
ling the charred remains to be identified.
A like oversight led to the hanging of
“Snowy” Rowles for the Murchison
(W.A.) murder. Prof. J. W. Webster, of
Harvard University, blundered in the
same way in 1849, when the lab. furnace
failed to consume Dr. George Parkman’s
teeth. Actually, teeth may even be made
to disclose their possessor’s occupation.
Those of sweet-makers decay rapidly,
and the exposed dentine becomes dis-
colored through the breathing in of sugar
dust. A coating of dirty-green indicates
the metal-worker; a large rhombic or
diamond-like opening in the centre of
the teeth distinguishes the glassblower,
and a concave substance-erosion brands
the pencil-chewing office-worker. But if
the substance-erosion is semicircular the
owner is an upholsterer, while incisor
teeth with coarsely-jagged edges denote
a shoemaker, who uses his mouth as a
container for nails and brads of varying
sizes. Even the tailor and needle-worker
deposit characteristic identification marks
on their molars, the biting or paring off
of the thread prior to threading the
needle leaving slip-shaped grooves on
the cutting edges of the incisors ; accord-
ing to whether the grooves run from
right to left, or vice versa, an expert can
tell whether the possessor is right- or left-
handed. And yet murderers will persist
in leaving their victims’ teeth lying where
they’re sure to be found!

“4 x 2”: A revolver can scarcely be
rendered “safe” by removing one of the
cartridges and allowing the hammer to
rest on the empty chamber (B. 28/2/’34).
The act of pulling the trigger will cause
the hammer to rise and the chamber to
revolve, and place the next cartridge
ready for the fall of the hammer. A
much better way of preventing accidental
discharge is to let the hammer rest on
the cartridge next to the empty chamber ;
if this is done, two pulls will have to
be made before a shot can be fired.
Writer served for some time after the
war in the R.1.C., and this method was
compulsory in that force.

“Mako”: Maorilanders also show
you the site of a City That Never Was
(B. 7/3/’34). Cornwallis was to have
been built on the shores of Manukau
Harbor, across the isthmus from Auck-
land. The population was to have been
drawn from the passengers of the ship
Brilliant. On the plan, still kept in Auck-
land, the chief thoroughfare is Brilliant-
place. But the Manukau is guarded by
what is said to be the heaviest bar in
the world—on it was wrecked the war-
ship Orpheus in the ’sixties—and the city-
to-be was at once confronted with trans-
port difficulties that did not exist for
Auckland, growing apace on the Waite-
mata Harbor, five miles away. The
pioneers distributed themselves over
more favorable and accessible areas, and
Cornwallis, still bush and scrub, exists
to-day only on a yellowed piece of paper.

“Clerk”: “B-scale’s” Sydney laborer
(B. 21/2/’34) is not the first Australian
who has tried unavailingly to work in
unconventional attire. A man who had
been booked for a day’s work in Mel-
bourne railway goods sheds shocked the
foreman by shedding coat, waistcoat and
trousers and trundling his hand-truck in
a simple costume of long underpants,
shirt, socks and boots. He pleaded that
the work would ruin his suit and that
there wasn’t the remotest chance of
women seeing him; but the foreman,
blushing hotly, insisted on his wearing
his pants. He cast his truck from him
and told the foreman what he could do
with the iob.
DONNIGAN THE WINNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
N.S.W. District Court has been occupied with a
dispute between the Trefry and Flanagan factions
of the Dulwich Hill New Guard Auxiliary. Ellen
Elizabeth Trefry, president, said that Elizabeth
Flanagan was named secretary and Eulalie Mulligan
treasurer. She introduced Mrs. Donnigan as secre-
tary. Mrs. Flanagan refused to hand over the books,
and the meeting became uproarious.”
“Sec.” was Elizabeth Flanagan;
Treasurer, Eulalie Mulligan:

Types of unswerving devotion,
Though scarcely as silent as sea-fry.

“Hamer”: Beer containers, is it? The
biggest I ever emptied—jugs omitted—
is “the West Coast schooner” of Maori-
land. Almost as capacious is the Tassie
“sinker.” Apropos, I recall a lawsuit
in Sydney which led to the general post-
ing of a notice to this effect:
The Mugs Sold in This Bar Are Sold as
Mugs, Not Pints.
Jimmy Ryan (“Narranghi Boori”), who
was to die in America, spent a hilarious
week seeing that the notices were altered
to declare that the containers were sold
to mugs as pints.

“Beta”: In the little courthouse in the
N.S.W. North Coast township accused
had been formally charged with passing
valueless cheques. Mr. Pewter, who had
cashed the biggest of the pieces of paper
forming exhibit A, was in the box. It
was his first appearance as a witness, and
he was determined to be dignified and
terse in his replies. “Mr. Pewter,” asked
accused’s solicitor, “as there is no bank
you cash numbers of cheques at
your hotel?” “Yes,” witness admitted.
“No doubt, Mr. Pewter, you get, now
and again, a cheque marked N.S.F.?”
This airing of what, to Mr. Pewter, was
an exceedingly touchy subject shattered
his carefully rehearsed aplomb. “My
ruddy oath I do! ”he exploded. His
outburst was charged with such feeling
that no rebuke came from a Bench fully
occupied in striving to keep a straight
face.

“Verri”: The superstition that there is
something baleful about mysterious ring-
ing sounds is by no means confined to
seafaring men. A Sydney man on a fish-
ing jaunt returned to camp to find his
wife lying in her bunk, weeping pro-
fusely. “I’m going to die,” she wailed.
“I heard bells ringing this afternoon —
bells, and you know there isn’t one for
miles round.” He did his best to comfort
his spouse; but next day he heard a
bell, followed by a female voice up-
lifted in song. Convinced that the spot
was haunted, the pair packed up and
shifted camp. They related their uncanny
experience to a friend who was a wireless
expert. The friend was able to reassure
them so successfully that they returned
to their original camping site with cheer-
ful and scientifically fortified minds.

the deferred pay is all gone. A hank
of khaki sewing-thread is the sole relic of
first issue on enlistment. The cretonne bag
which received my personal effects at the
casualty clearing* station is still in action
as a first-aid bag for bandages and medi-
cal kit, though I have mislaid the label
which certified that it was “Presented by
the Ladies of England.” Unfortunately, I
lost my army-issue razor the day after
it was handed out, but I still have the
shaving-brush. I bought it at a B.E.F.
canteen at Hazebrouck in 1917, and have
used it for every shave since. Consider-
ing it only cost a bob, I should like to
congratulate the makers, if I only knew
who they were.

“Champignon”: Nearly a score of
hapless Filipinos met their deaths in Cali-
fornia the other day by eating poisonous
fungi in mistake for wholesome mush-
rooms. It’s a mis-
take quite likely to
be made by persons
unfamiliar with the
vegetation of a new
land. The whole
mushroom question
is a perplexing one,
in that growths reck-
oned edible in some
countries are labelled
dangerous in others.
There are several
species of so-called
“toadstools” in Bri-
tain which the un-
wary are solemnly
warned against, but
an Italian visiting
England once told
me that some of
these so - called
noxious vegetables—
or things so like
them as to be indis-
tinguishable were
widely consumed in
Italy without the
slightest ill effects. I
have heard exactly
the same thing about
English and Russian
mushrooms', one
country’s meat being
regarded as the
other’s poison, and
vice versa. A high
scientific authority
in Sydney says that the way to tell
whether a fungus is edible is to nibble
a morsel—if it tastes nutty, it’s all right;
if acid, spit.it out.
* * * *
“Strict Veg.”: The action of the Mel-
bourne jurymen who fasted for 6} hours
under the delusion that they were not
allowed to communicate with the out-
side world while they were considering
their verdict raises various legal ques-
tions. ’Sonah could not legally tell them
on their retirement that they could come
back into court and ask for a meal to
be sent in to them, because that might
carry the inference that their delibera-
tions would be lengthy. There is no men-
tion on jury papers about bodily sus-
tenance, and once inside the jury-room
twelve just men cannot be legally in-
terrupted, even by a knock on the
door or a whistle. Nor is it the
duty of any court official to advise
them of their rights in the matter,
In fact, there is no provision in law for
protecting them from the consequences
of their own ignorance, and one of these
days twelve unsophisticated men and true
may starve to death in the performance
of their duty,
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: Last time Wirth’s circus
visited Naracoorte (S.A.) the most ex-
citing turn was given outside the tent,
A pieman had rented a stand there, and
after he had taken his horse home was
told he had his portable cafe in the
wrong spot. “But never mind,” the
manager said, “we’ll shift it with the
elephant.” Jumbo soon towed it to the
right spot. But when he stopped the
pie-cart didn’t; its momentum carried it
on, with the result that the red-hot stove
was pushed hard against his rear eleva-
tion. Trumpeting madly, with trunk out-
stretched, ears standing out stiffly and the
crowd scattering before him, the elephant
“Got anything good in the fiction line, miss?”
“How about a mystery yarn where the policeman solves the murder?”
bolted, pies, peas, plates and gravy being
shed in his wake. When he was stopped
the inside of the pie-cart resembled a
cook’s nightmare. The proprietor was
wondering what his loss would amount to
when one of the Wirths came along,
stated that the circus accepted respon-
sibility and told him to present his bill at
the office.
* * * *
“Double Disc”: In “Grenade’s” par.
(B. 28/2/’34) about “Big Bertha” only
one gun is mentioned. As a matter of
fact there were four, each in a separate
emplacement. Owing to the terrific initial
velocity imparted to the shell by its pro-
pelling charge, the wear on the “A” tubes
was so great that 60 rounds constituted
the life of a gun. When “Bertha” started
dropping her pills in Paris there were
some extraordinary conjectures concern-
ing the calibre. One theory was that the
gun fired a shell of about 18in. diameter,
and that just before maximum height of
trajectory was reached the shell exploded
and drove forth from its interior a shell
of smaller calibre ; this carried on the
good work, and in turn pushed out the
projectile which landed in Paris. Even
a tyro in ballistics could see the absur-
dity of this, yet I knew senior artillery
officers who believed implicitly in the
theory. No one (Fritz excepted) thought
of the idea of pushing the shell up into
the stratosphere.
* * *
“F.S.”: I am interested in one of the
reasons given by Melbourne’s Curator of
Parks and Gardens for remov-
ing the copies of Greek statu-
ary which strike a pleasant
note of white amongst the
green of the Fitzroy Gardens.
“Diana’s goat,” says Mr.
Smith, “was disabled by the
lack of horns and a tail.”
Goats are admittedly not as
frequent a feature of the Vic-
torian landscape as they are of
Bananaland’s; still, there are
a few about. So, even if Mr. Smith is
more of a botanist than a zoologist, he
ought to have observed by now that
Diana’s animal isn’t a goat —it’s a
fawn.
* * * *
“Tabary”: A thing that always puzzles
me is the magisterial and even judicial
practice of telling a delinquent, as an
alternative to being gaoled, to inflict his
presence upon some neighboring locality.
The country magistrate gives an unwanted
sojourner 12 hours to leave the town ;
the city beak or Judge stipulates that
the undesirable, if not too notoriously
of criminal character, shall leave the State,
and neither troubles what extra work he
is likely to provide for other Courts. In
a Melbourne case the other day a police
sergeant said of the occupant of the
dock: “She is one of the worst women in
Sydney, but her last sentence of three
months was suspended on her undertaking
to leave the State within seven days and
to remain away for two years.” His
Washup rather cogently pointed out that
even the worst sort of woman, if she was
driven out of one State, had no choice
except to go to another, but the ser-
geant grumbled that “Sydney was putting
backwash on us.” No doubt, and Sydney
is equally likely to'get the same back-
wash from Melbourne or Brisbane or
Adelaide under the present muddled
system. I wonder what principle of juris-
prudence this vicious practice is supposed
to rest on. The householder who found
a dead dog in his yard and decided that
the simplest way of getting rid of it was
to heave it over the wall into his neigh-
bor’s premises would be justly repro-
bated. But our law administrators con-
tinue to heave their rotten eggs over the
border without the slightest compunction.
* * * *
“Billy See”: Fourteen years ago Abdul-
lah, an Afghan, 65 years old, was found
shot in his camp at Lawlers (W.A.). No
motive for the crime was apparent, and
no arrest was made. Now Mahommed
Bux, a Carnarvon camel-driver, has gone
to the police with a confession. It has
the elements of a stunning mystery story:
a wrong done to a girl; a brother’s three-
day tramp from Leonora to Lawlers,
intent on avenging it ; the shooting;
then 14 years of remorse, which cul-
minated in the dramatic surrender.
Incidentally, there is a baker in it who
thought he could pull teeth like a den-
tist. In this belief he broke Abdullah’s
jaw, and this complicated the issue ; the
fatal wound was also through the jaw
and led to a minor theory of suicide.
The self-accused man was born in Cool-
gardie of a Hindoo father and a white
mother.

A soliloquy:
“All right old chap come out to lunch and
bring all the idiots I mean the children jolly
glad to see you [hangs up receiver] you idiot
why did you tell me to invite them out to
lunch now you’ve done it confound you I
know exactly what will happen it’ll be 105 in
the shade I know it will hot northerly and all
the rest of it house like an oven and the blow-
flies buzzing everywhere and it’ll be the same
in their house and she’ll say to him why'on
earth did you say we’d come to lunch and he’ll
say to her why you told me to but anyhow we
needn’t go if you don’t want to and she’ll say
oh yes we needn’t go needn’t we just like a
man you are and she spends the whole morning
cooking a hot meal nobody wants to eat and
then we don’t turn up to eat it and so they’ll
come and we’ll all sit round and talk and after
half an hour we’ll be bored with one another
and it’ll be too hot to go outside and too hot
to stay inside and we’ll sit down to lunch and
overeat ourselves from sheer vexation and then
what with the beer and the heat and the flies
we’ll be so sleepy we’ll get half silly and pro-
bably get into a stupid argument and then the
kids will get excited and they’ll start bawling
and so it’ll go on I know it will look at her
there she is at her infernal cooking as cool as a
cucumber not a thought in her head about what
my feelings are if she only knew what I was
thinking about her she’d sit up and take some
notice and not be so dashed cheerful I hate
cheerful people.”
MY SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The moon was yellow as a plum,
The river made no sound,
That night I wove a song for you
And hid it in the ground.
But from the ground tall roses grew,
Ragged and sweet and red:
They built a wall against the song
1 sang for one long dead.
Perhaps the flowers, more wise than I,
Set up those perfumed bars
Knowing your dust had left the earth
And blossomed into stars.
QUEENSLAND.

POLITICAL POINTS
McPhee, the only remaining pre-
depression Premier, said at the week-end
that he would announce his retirement
from politics at a party meeting to be
held at Hobart to-day. It is expected
that Lee, his substitute at the Premiers’
conference, will take his place, and that
Neil Campbell will succeed Lee as Min-
ister of Lands and Works. Campbell is
one of the members for Wilmot, which
the Prime Minister represents at Can-
berra ; and Joseph Aloysius will be
charmed to see him elevated.
In Westralian Assembly last June there
were some acrid inquiries concerning the
whereabouts of Mr. Kenneally, who,
named Minister of Unemployment—a
full-time job, it was explained—had al-
most immediately made himself scarce.
It transpired that he had gone to Sydney
for the usual quarterly “unity” Labor
conference. Mr. Kenneally was in Syd-
ney again last week on another of these
fruitless missions. Possibly his State can
spare him, but some bigoted Tory might
ask whether, when thus engaged, he
waives his claim to Ministerial salary and
expenses.
On the last day of the “Labor unity
conference” Lang’s newspaper came out
with a prospectus of “Labor Motor
Funerals, Ltd.,” which was inset into a
report of the proceedings beginning with
the words “A day of vacillation ended
in confusion.” Members of all the Labor
factions grinned at the juxtaposition, but
delegates failed to see the joke. They
wound up their discussions with the sav-
age declaration that “the attitude of the
‘Labor Daily’ has militated against the
efforts of organised Labor to achieve
unity.” Thirty-four indignant gentlemen
supported the motion, and only two (the
Tasmanian Dwyer Gray and his leader
Ogilvie) were against it.
The Australian wine trade was in-
formed last week that its U.S. quota was
to be increased from 6000 gallons or so
a month to 50,000 gallons. A day or
two later came the news that the quota
system was to be dropped altogether;
and the trade doesn’t know what to make
of it —or of the President. That gentle-
man is bewilderingly addicted to chang-
ing his mind. Our winemakers ask for
nothing more than a fair spin in the
American market, and it is for the Gov-
ernment at Canberra to see that they get
it. So far they haven’t got it.
Because wool is up and wheat is still
down, A. H. E. McDonald, Director of
Agriculture, predicts a 25 per cent,
reduction in the area of wheat sown in
N. S. Wales. He said that to the Wheat
Commission the other day, and suggested
that a large number of landowners might
give up growing wheat altogether. If
they do there will be few share-farmers
left. Growing wheat on shares used to
be a brisk industry in at least two States,
but the price-collapse has almost settled
it.
A first-class row is developing in
Westralia over the restriction of jobs on
Government relief work to men with
A.W.U. tickets. Minister Kenneally is-
sued the ukase, and if he does not with-
draw it he will be called to account
when Parliament meets. Apart from the
wicked injustice of imposing this test on
men who must work or starve, the un-
employed have a union of their own. It
may not be much of a union, but at least
it is not likely to*extort a £1 levy from
its members for a daily newspaper in
Sydney, as the A.W.U. bosses did, and
drop £130,000 on it 18 years later.
Tas. Labor was represented at the
“unity” conference in Sydney by a dele-
gation of six, nominally headed by E. J.
Ogilvie but split into two factions. At
the instance of the Langsters, the State
A.L.P. seceded from the Federal body
last year, but the secession motion was
rescinded at the annual conference at
Launceston on Feb. 28. Ogilvie tried
to tack on a lot of Lang-inspired reso-
lutions demanding, among other things,
“the right to a regional tariff” and “suit-
able Commonwealth steamers in the im-
mediate future,” but he was snubbed.
Lyons does not measure up to the
requirements of a Prime Minister, but it
was an unhappy day for Tas. Labor when
Ogilvie took his place as State leader.
Edward Mitchell, K.C., Victoria’s great
constitutional lawyer, declares that, under
the Constitution as amended in conse-
quence of the 1928 referendum, the Loan
Council has no power to sanction the set-
ting up of a board to borrow for Gov-
ernment relief works, and that if enab-
ling legislation is passed by the N.S.W.
Parliament “it will be inconsistent with
the Financial Agreement,
and invalid.” Lang tried
to flatten out the Finan-
cial Agreement and failed.
Unless Edward Mitchell is
wildly wrong for once,
Stevens will be equally
unsuccessful in getting
round it.
The New Deal was a
year old on March 5. In
a birthday message to “my
dear fellow-citizens,” the
President informed “indus-
try” that its “immediate
“Wish I could split this wood as easy as them Labor blokes split their party!”
task” was “to re-employ more people at
purchasing wages,” which his offsider
Johnston interpreted to mean a 10 p.c.
increase in pay and a 10 p.c. decrease
in working hours. Mr. Roosevelt added
that his policies are called Fascist by
some critics and socialist by others, and
he feels amused. It is improbable that
amusement is felt by the people ordered
to find the 10 p.c. more pay for 10 p.c.
less work.
For threatening to expel Percy Pease,
the Minister of Lands, because he sacked
Government relief workers who went on
strike, the Innisfail branch of Queens-
land Labor has itself been expelled.
It talks of forming a Lang group.
In ordinary circumstances the offer
would be rushed by the Langsters
in Sydney ; but Innisfail has become too
exciting. An Italian was shot dead there
the other day, and the party with the
revolver explained that it was because the
defunct had cut his ears off. Instead of
tearing himself away from his Hawkes-
bury farm to visit such an unhealthy
region, Lang might order one of the
Lazzarinis to go —preferably the one he
threw out of his Ministry in 1927.
Last year’s Premiers’ conference went
through the empty form of appointing
a sub-committee “to examine the pro-
blem of double taxation as between
States for the purpose of procuring re-
ciprocal legislation.” N.S.W. Assistant-
Treasurer Spooner mentioned this when
introducing his Special Income Tax Bill
and gave it as an excuse for permitting
bushranging to go on. At the recent
orgy of chin-wagging in Melbourne, the
problem was just mentioned and that
was all. There are thousands of victims
in N. S. Wales alone, but they are scat-
tered, so their vote doesn’t matter.
The Westralian Parliamentary com-
mittee which is drawing up a case for
secession to be sent to London might well
round it off with an intelligent antici-
pation of the reply. It could be boiled
down to a few words—“ The answer is in
the negative,” or something like that.
The secessionists aim at establishing a
Dominion like Newfoundland. J. Bull
has had to take over the affairs of that
distressed offspring and pay a bill of
£274,000 for a start.’ He hasn’t to worry
much about the defence of Newfound-
land, but Westralia would be another
pair of sleeves.
A bit off the rates would be a welcome
gift to property-owners in the City of
Sydney, but they are not to get it. For
one thing, resumptions made in the boom
time are costing about £380,000 a year.
Some people did wonderfully well out of
resumptions, but it wasn’t the ratepayers.
Then a huge staff is maintained, and the
decree is that its pay and privileges must
on no account be reduced, even should
wage-fixers regard them as lavish. A
costly award obtained from Judge Cantor
has been held up on this ground by the
Labor aldermen, helped by Lord Mayor
Parker and Alderman McElhone. These
gentlemen were Civic Reformers, but
have ratted or recanted or something.
The British Post Office out of its sur-
plus has contributed £6,000,000 to Inland
Revenue this last year. Britons grumble
about the administration, but they don’t
know when they are well off. If Park-
hill’s concern were handled as well postal
rates and telephone charges could be
reduced and there would be enough left
for a substantial income-tax cut.
It is refreshing to hear a State repre-
sentative say, as the departing A. E.
Heath did in Sydney, that “fundamen-
tally Australian representation in Lon-
don should be Federal.” The Common-
wealth has had cause to thank its stars
that the loan-conversion job was in one
set of hands. Had half a dozen wrang-
ling and whispering As.-G. been on the
job, the results might have been vastly
different.
The new Rabaul “Parliament” lived up
to the best traditions when it opened its
second session with 35 bills. Most of the
honorables are officials, who are expected
to give block votes on matters vital to the
Government. That does not seem to stop
them from talking. While departments
spend hours weeping for their absent
heads, “Hansard,” extracts from which
now fill the main pages of the Rabaul
“Times,” finds itself as busy as a bar-
maid on race-day.
London County Council has just held
its triennial election, and Labor is in for
the first time. A defeat of this group
preceded the rout of the Labor parties
at the British and Australian general elec-
tions of 1931 ; but it is improbable that
the omen will worry members of the
MacDonald Ministry, seeing what the
victorious leader nas promised his fol-
lowers. He is going to provide “enor-
mous employment” by building more
bridges over the Thames, “new satellite
towns” and “200,000 workers’ flats with
roof , gardens, lawns and swimming
baths.” The gentleman reminds rate-
payers who were too lazy to vote that he
did not promise not to raise the rates.
T. R. Bavin has had the courage to say
this:
Many of the disabilities from which the
States are suffering are inherent in the Federal
system of government, which in itself is weak
and defective, and dependent for its successful
working.... on the reasonableness and self-
restraint of the authorities operating under it.
And in critical times it never works suc-
cessfully unless the man in charge over-
rides it. Lincoln had to do this before
he could put down a rebellion, and
Roosevelt has had to do it in order to
get results—whether or not the results
are worth while remains to be proved.
Perhaps Australia took the wrong turn-
ing when it departed from the British sys-
tem, under which Parliament is supreme
and unchallenged and national and pro-
vincial powers are for ever separated.
The British system works.
W. R. Warmington, who has been leader
of the Greater Brisbane municipal Labor
party since its formation in 1925, and
who before that was as firm a fixture as
Red Hill in the municipal landscape of
Ithaca, has been defeated in the party
ballot. He is appealing on the ground
of “irregularities.” In Fortitude Valley,
where a large element has always re-
fused to accept defeat with fortitude,
there are also ructions.
J. W. M. Laidlaw, chairman of the
Sydney Bench of stipendiary magistrates,
has been promoted to the Licenses Re-
duction Board at £1250 p.a.; with him
goes W. C. Geikie, at £lOOO p.a., and
T. W. Cohen remains a member at £3OO
p.a. —all less statutory salary-cuts. Cohen
was 65 last year. The Government laid
it down then that public servants were
too old at 60.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
William Freeman, of Adelaide, aged
104, thinks he is the only Crimean veteran
in Australia. He is a Scot by birth, but
has been a good Australian for more than
half his life.
“D.”: My confidence in the solidity
and commonsense of Premier Stevens rests
on a rocklike base. He is the only short,
fat man I have struck in recent years
who, having succeeded in life, has re-
frained from posturing as a reincarnated
Napoleon.
Tom Cheadle, S.A.’s member on the
Wheat Commission, has hitherto been
more of an authority on wool. He is a
director of the Bennett and Fisher Co.
and chairman of the Adelaide Wool-
brokers’ Association. He used to be a
keen golfer, and won the S.A. champion-
ship before he was 21.
Adelaide is sending Perth a good man
in J. H. Reynolds, who is to be senior
tutor at St. George’s, and lecturer in
history at the Uni. He was the S.A.
Rhodes scholar of 1928, and was brought
back from Oxford in 1932 to be acting-
head of St. Mark’s while Grenfell Price
studied conditions in the U.S.A.
Senator Bob Elliott is the only
member of the Federal Parliament who
owns a township. He bought Cundie’s
River (Vic.) in 1922. Most of those who
make up its small population are em-
ployed at the White Star lime works and
other local Elliott enterprises. Other
distinctions which Elliott can claim are
the finest collections of Orpens outside
the Kensington Galleries and a remark-
able father-in-law in Theodore Fink, of
the “Herald and Weekly Times.”
Arnold Sims is at last an official mem-
ber of the Adelaide City Council. The
ratepayers have just elected him. For
years he was known as the unofficial
member: he used to attend every meet-
ARNOLD SIMS. He has made his
hobby his business.
ing as an onlooker, an odd hobby which
often resulted in his being the only
listener-in there except the martyrs of the
press. When not at the council he super-
vises a big city factory.
E. H. Major, who has resigned from
“the Firm,” is the only secretary it has
had. He took the post in 1911, when
it was incorporated. This square-jawed,
upright, active customer, who looks a
cross between an actor and a soldier,
came to Australia originally to grow
fruit. His father was a Director of Army
Contracts at the British War Office.
Edmund Collins decided in early youth
not to follow in the steps of his father,
the late H. M. Collins, who laid the
foundation of Reuters in Australia and
wrote “From Pigeon Post to Wireless.”
Instead, he gravitated to Gilbeys. Once
decided to hold a private Royal Com-
mission on the Australian brand of gin,
and set out on an expedition across the
EDMUND COLLINS, wine merchant
and sportsman.
Nullarbor Plain to view her at first hand,
armed to the teeth with about half a ton
of magazines and newspapers to barter
with the local native. In his diary (not
so far in the Mitchell Library) it is re-
corded that he arrived at Perth exhausted
from parrying the continued attacks of
discriminating inhabitants who strove
at any cost to take his store of Bulle-
tins from him. He has now retired from
the exploring business and concentrates
on fly-fishing, shooting and a younger
Collins, who stroked the 1930 Melbourne
Grammar eight to victory in record time.
From “Inner Temple”:
The leaders in the “Rasputin” libel action
were both Laborites who became Attorney-
Generals and then got sick of the party. Sir
Patrick Hastings, who represented the plaintiff,
has had the most adventurous life of any mem-
ber of the London Bar. He fought in the
S. African War as a private, has served before
the mast, and worked as a mining engineer,
journalist, playwright and in other capacities
before he was called in 1904. There is no
better man with juries in England.
Sir William Jowitt, who led for M.-G.-M.,
isn’t nearly so popular with the profession.
Originally a Liberal, he suffered a sudden
change of heart six years ago when it became
obvious that his party was out of favor. He
turned Laborite, and was immediately rewarded
with the Attorney-Generalship and a knight-
hood. He became a P.C. in 1931, and has
since concentrated on his profession.
H. C. Cornforth, who has been head
of the Vacuum Oil Co. in Australia for
18 years, left on the Monterey for the
U.S.A. and England. In 30 years he has
seen the capital of the co. rise from
£lOO,OOO to £7,500,000. He inaugurated
bulk distribution of its products through-
out the Commonwealth; it led to the
spending inside five years of £5,000,000
on plant and equipment. When not work-
ing H.C.C. mostly plays golf. He is vice-
president of the Sorrento (Vic.) G.C., and
is well and favorably known at the great
Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide clubs.
Australia achieved a new centenarian
on Saturday—Thomas Gilligan, of New-
town, Sydney, who was born near Parra-
matta on March 10, 1834. He netted a
small fortune at Lambing Flat; added
to it in a droving enterprise which took
him south-north across the continent;
dropped a parcel silver-mining ; got it
back at gold-mining; and, generally,
made things hum in trade, sport and
adventure till he got too old for an active
life. He is an interesting example of
what solid toil, a temperate life and a
good heredity can do for a man; he
might be 20 years younger than his con-
fessed age.
The Vic. Taxpayers’ Association has
elected Charles W. Wilson as its new
president. As owner of Scott s Hotel, he
will have thousands of complaints and
miles of statistics laid on like tap water ;
as a director of the Australian Travel Asso-
ciation, he will learn tolerance from the
touring oppressed ; as a former head of
the Melbourne Scots society, he will
tackle his job with zest; and, as leader of
the delegation to Canberra which did
much towards getting the last million and
a quarter of land-tax reduction, he should
get to work in a hopeful mood. More
particularly since McKellar White, presi-
dent of the N. S. Wales Taxpayers’ Asso-
ciation, and likely nominee for the Fed-
eral presidency, is an ex-official of the
Taxation Department, and hence up to
every move in the game they will play
together.
Colonel Brinsmead, who died in Mel-
bourne on Sunday, never recovered from
the injuries he received in the Dutch air-
mail crash in Siam at the end of ’32. He
had a first-class military mind, and would
have had a great future with luck.
When the accident happened which was
responsible for his death, he was only
48, had an iron constitution, and was
Controller-General of Civil Aviation and
a member of the Commonwealth Air
Board. A cheery, iron-jawed, medium-
sized individual, he looked the typical
Digger, though by birth he was English.
He enlisted in T 4, won a commission
before embarking for Egypt, and landed
at Gallipoli with the 24th Battalion as
its adjutant. He collected an M.C. and
a bad leg wound at Pozieres. After com-
ing out of hospital he transferred to the
A.F.C., and soon proved to be as bril-
liant in the capacity of staff officer as
he was in the field. He made a number
of notable flights after the war, the best-
known being his round-Australia trip in
’24, and he went as a delegate to the Civil
Aviation Conference at Washington four
years later.
For the first four days of Sydney’s
humorously-named Labor unity confer-
ence a square-jawed, poker-faced stranger
sat in observant silence. “He has come
from W.A. to get the strength of Lang-
ism,” delegates told one another. On
the fifth day he cut loose with a devas-
tating attack on the Auburn idol and his
idolisers. (“There has been evasion and
shuffling by the Lang party ever since
Premier COLLIER, who came from W.
Aus. to give Langism the once-over.
we came here.”) Here he is—Premier
Collier. He began wage-earning as a Vic.
miner, and before he entered politics was
a corporation laborer at Boulder. He
has been in various W.A. Parliaments
for 29 years, and has been leader of his
party since T 6.
This is George Connor, the Indepen-
dent who won the Alexandra (S. Aus.) by-
election. His victory was a slap in the
eye for the Butler Government; and the
Premier’s airy remark that it had “no
significance” is regarded as the political
joke of the season. Connor triumphed
because many Liberals were disgusted by
GEORGE CONNOR, Independent

the extension of the Parliamentary term
to five years, by the Government’s admin-
istration of the Transport Act and by its
failure to help the dairying industry. The
new member has lived in the district most
of his life, and is a primary producer with
varied interests at Kangarilla.
Senator McLachlan, the South Aus-
tralian who becomes Acting-Attorney-
General during J. G. Latham’s absence
in Japan, held the job in 1926-27, while
the occupant was away at the Imperial
Conference. He is a barrister of nearly
40 years’ standing, with a keen interest in
insurance, Scottish affairs and football,
and he made the Ministry within three
months of taking his seat in the Senate
in ’26. R. G. Casey, who will take charge
of External Affairs, is a sure bet for the
permanent portfolio at a later date. He
is the best linguist in Canberra, was Ger-
man interpreter with the first convoy of
the A.1.F., and helped to question the
captured Emden officers.
Poverty Pointers will lament the death
of George Peterson, who had been
advance agent for Wirths’ Circus since

George Crowley, who had been chairman
and/or managing director for 43 years,
died during the last term. His place has
been taken by G. E. Bryant, who had sat
with him at the board table since 1916.
For many years the co. had claimed
to pay higher bonuses than any
other life office in the world. The
fatness in this respect was mainly the
result of high interest rates, following
a policy of mortgage and property in-
vestments on a rising market. Such
a policy proved to be very helpful
in securing new business at moderate
cost. The board, however, is now paying
more attention to Australian Consols.
The cut in interest on mortgages and
Government securities, growth of taxa-
tion and the effects of moratorium legis-
lation, together with the contraction of
property values, have affected the margin
available for bonuses as well as the book
value of some of the assets.
Still, subject to political developments,
policy-holders need not be apprehensive,
apart from bonus prospects. Whatever
gaps may still remain between the book
and market values of some of the assets
can be expected to narrow, or disappear
altogether, as conditions improve.
The £269,756 of cash bonuses declared
last year was equal to 39.2 p.c. of the
1932 net premium income as against
52.6 p.c. and 52 p.c. in respect of the
two preceding terms, and £233,183 of it
remained in the business as additional
insurance. The bonus rates, which were
still very handsome, ranged from £2 17s.
6d. p.c. to £4 ss. p.c. on whole-of-life, and
from £2 p.c. to £3 10s. p.c. on endow-
ment assurances. Indications are that
these rates will be maintained in respect
of the last term, though the actuary has
not yet definitely measured up the amount
available for distribution.
Excluding bonuses, the spring in the
year’s income (£1,003,147) was £14,463
—net premiums (£672,646) shrank
£14,445, the consideration for annuities
(£34,937) was up £14,334, and interest
and rents (£295,564) brought in an extra
£14,575. After paying all legitimate
claims and exes., and sending £lOO,OOO
to the contingencies reserve (now
£450,000), £228,669 was added to the
assurance fund, making it £6,754,893.
The slip of £1,037,997 in the amount
of new business written was more appar-
ent than real. Reversionary bonus addi-
tions, previously included with new busi-
ness figures, were excluded last year;
the amount involved was about £580,000:

Annuities . . .. 400 20,603 34,937
Interest, etc. .. 30,722 280,989 295,564
Again excluding bonuses, exes, took 14.9
p.c. of the year’s income as against 16.5,
15.7, 12.9, 14.5 and 13.4 p.c. back to
1928. Now that the outlook has bright-
ened somewhat, a more vigorous hunt
for new business can be expected.
The office assumes that its funds will
turn in p.c. After deducting income
tax, etc., last year’s net interest return
was a shade over 3* p.c. With the re-
duction in taxation the margin should
widen; much also depends upon the
resumption of interest payments by some
mortgagors.
The assets are in this form:

During the year the book value of mort-
§a§? s was reduced by £110,650, while
£285,977 was added to Government
securities, £107,045 to shares, etc.,
£60,513 to cash, etc., £11,626 to loans on
policies and £11,581 to the property item

not mentioned.

This seven-year-old offshoot of the big
Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co., Akron,
L.S.A.—the parent decided to manufac-
locall Y owing to pressure of the
tariff—which put up a factory and plant
;‘ a c “ st . of over £990,000, has paid
£Z00,898 in divs., and at Dec 31 last
had accumulated £365,775 of reserves
and a more or less liquid surplus of
£647,388. Of its £BOO,OOO of capital, half
a million ords. were taken by the parent
f°i cash, and 300,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
were snapped locally. Having stepped into
a ready-made trade connection, developed
by an importing agency, the co.’s output
soon doubled ; more plant, etc., had to be
installed, and the parent found the money
(over half a million at the end of 1930),
since repaid.
Slump gave sales a nasty jolt, of course,
and made stocks troublesome, while
casualties in the motor and ancillary
trades kept the debts question acute.
Hence the abrupt contraction in earn-
ings for the two years to the end of
1931. Then the tide turned. There were
28,000 more cars on the roads in Aus-
tralia at June 30 last than there were a
year earlier, and the number has in-
creased since. Imports of chassis during
1933 nearly doubled, and the demand for
replacement tyres increased, too. Further
the figures suggest that the co. stocked
up while rubber prices were low—best
plantation, which fetched no more than
1.77 d. (London) in the middle of 1932,
rose from 2.27 d. to 4.05 d. during 1933.
After making substantial allowances
for depreciation, etc., the co. was able
to exhibit £82,802 more profit last year,
notwithstanding cuts aggregating 17£ p.c.
in its selling prices. After allowing for
the pref. div., enough remained to show
23.3 p.c. on ord. capital as against 6.8,
2.4, 11.9, 45 and 21.2 p.c. back to 1928.
So, having consolidated the position, the
div. was lifted from 8 p.c. to 16 p.c.,
making the average 3.4 p.c. over the last
seven years.
As for the current term, primage and
the duty on raw rubber (they used to be
10 p.c. and 4d. per pound respectively)
have been halved, while sales, income and
other taxes have been reduced a little,
and there is more money about.
During the year, the board not only
repaid the balance of the debt to the
parent, but lent it £14,246 besides, and
added £252,274 to the cash holding:

balances by £25,275 and £104,947 more
was written off than was spent on fixed
assets, reducing their book value to 52.6
p.c. of their cost. The improvement in the
more or less liquid surplus (£647,388)
was £89,766.
Over the last 12 months the prefs. have
advanced from 265. 9d. to 31s. in the
market. The return at the higher figure
is 5.1 p.c., the co. having waived its
rights in respect of the 22\ p.c. statu-
tory cut. The cover is £3 17s. sd. in net
tangibles.

Since its inception in 1894 this co-opera-
tive concern has paid its suppliers on the
fertile N. S. Wales North Coast over
£30,400,000 for butter and nearly
£3,000,000 for pigs. Last year it handled
record quantities of both comfnodities —
16,396 tons of butter (up 2063 tons) and
60,080 pigs (up 1858)—yet butter sales
were £107,114 lighter, owing to the col-
lapse of prices:

Thus, although bacon turned in an extra
£18,203, £120,428 less was distributed to
suppliers. The average for butter was
8.38 d. per lb. as against 10,3 d., 12.68 d.
and 13.77 d. for the three preceding years,
and for A 1 pork 4.33 d. as against 4.4 d.
in 1932. The Paterson levy of lfd. per
lb. (=£267,804) took an extra £24,453,
and selling exes., etc. (£316,255), were
£5lOO heavier, being 15 p.c. of turnover
as against 14.2 p.c. in 1932. The spring
in the percentage cost is due to the fall in
prices. The year’s profit (£16,018), which
all came from the co.’s Sydney selling
floor, was 15.8 p.c. on capital as against
12.8 p.c. in 1932. The div. was kept at
5 p.c., £3145 was written off sharehold-
ings, and £3640 was sent to reserves.
The steady growth of production, and
other things, are reflected in the next
comparison of balance-sheet figures:

The year’s improvement in the financial
position was £11,163. Liabilities, mainly
amounts coming to consignors, exceeded
more or less liquids, excluding shares in
other cos., by £33,293 when the books
closed.
Despite various attempts to prop up
the market, the London price of Aus-
tralian choicest fell from 82s. per cwt
at the beginning of 1932 to 645. in April •
the figure rose to 110 s. in Sept., but was
back to 665. in Dec., and is now fairly
steady at 685.; local prices fluctuated
accordingly. At 68s. London the return
to the Australian producer is approxi-
mately 83s. 3d. This is made up of
selling price plus exchange (175.), plus
export bounty (285.), less c.i.f. charges
(13s. 5d.). In addition, the dairyman has
to pay a levy of lfd. per pound, or 16s.
4d. per cwt. Presently the voluntary
Paterson scheme will be superseded by
legislation, designed to regulate inter-
state shipments and the local price of
butter. Meanwhile, Australia and Maori-
land producers have decided to with-
hold 20 p.c. of the export surplus during
the peak period, the aim being to make
London deliveries more even.

There never has been much in it for
shareholders; a lone 5 p.c. in the first
eight years and an average of 4.8 p.c.
since the old Clarendon was taken over
in 1910. There was a short burst of 10
p.c. divs. during the boom ; but other
hotels sprang up, the Spit (Middle
Harbor) bridge failed to bring Manly the
business that was anticipated, and then
slump brought losses instead of profits.
During the last term the new shark-
proof swimming pool, put up on the
harbor beach at Manly by the ferry co.,
brought more people to the Village, and
things generally improved. Still, after
setting aside £750 for repairs and re-
newals, the board was able to show a
profit of no more than 0.3 p.c. on the
£35,000 of capital. The market, which
expects that the co. can do a lot better,
prices the pound shares at 13s. The re-
turn at that figure would be 4.6 p.c. on
the basis of a 3 p.c. div., which would
call for £lO5O p.a. Much depends upon
what the board has been able to spend
on repairs and maintenance out of re-
venue.

Over the half-dozen years to the close of

was £855. Liabilities include £20,000 5\
p.c. perpetual debentures, of which
£12,000 was the purchase price of the
Clarendon. While the co.’s funds con-
tinue to earn less than 5i p.c., these
debentures will remain a drag.

A 40 YEARS’ FRANCHISE.
A 40 years’ franchise, issued under Act of Parliament and Order in Council, has been obtained from the Queensland Govern-
ment, conferring the right to levy and collect tolls on the Highway.
The Government has no right of resumption until the expiry of 20 years and at subsequent five years’ periods.
In the event of resumption before the expiry of 40 years, the Government must pay the Fair Original Cost of the work, less
Sinking Fund. And in the event of such resumption—
a minimum Annual Income of 8 per cent, on the Fair Original Cost is guaranteed by the Queensland Government
under Act and Order in Council for the full period up to the date of resumption.
THE PROJECT DESCRIBED.
Designed to carry out a project of national importance, the plan aims at the construction of a viaduct 1 2-3 miles in length
over an arm of Moreton Bay, Queensland, together with short lengths of roadway. This will bring the popular seaside resort of
Redcliffe within 18 miles of the heart of the Metropolis and will shorten the one-way journey by nine miles—or a total of 18 miles
for the return trip. No railway to Redcliffe exists.
According to statistics supplied by the Town Clerk of Redcliffe, 3000 cars are parked in the area during average week-ends,
and 10,000 during special holidays, such as Christmas Day, Boxing Day, etc. These figures take no account of everyday traffic,
which is considerable. On principal holidays it is estimated that 40,000 to 50,000 persons visit Redcliffe.
The Toll Charge, fixed by Act of Parliament, for motor cars containing not more than six persons i 3 1/-. Rates for other traffic
range from 3d. to 2/6. '
With the completion of the Highway, Redcliffe will become a residential bayside suburb of Brisbane, thus greatly increasing
traffic, which will be further increased when the Highway becomes part of the Main Coast Road, leading to the splendid surfing
beaches and mountain resorts in the North Coast district.
The Logan Toll Bridge, between Brisbane and Southport, much farther distant than the Hornibrook Highway, in 1932-33
produced a toll revenue of £10,5 39, which was 8 per cent, greater than in the previous year.
A traffic census taken at Redcliffe for 1 5 weeks showed that the volume of road traffic to Redcliffe was twice that on the- Logan
Toll Bridge during the same period.
FINANCING THE UNDERTAKING.
The total estimated cost of the undertaking is £285,000, of which £lOO,OOO is to be provided by the A.M.P. Society in the
form of a first mortgage loan for 20 years at per cent. The Queensland Government has agreed to guarantee principal and
interest of this loan provided the present debenture certificate issue of £135,000 is first subscribed. Apart from the present issue,
debenture certificates to the amount of £50,000 are being taken up. These amounts, together with £135,000 to be provided by
the present issue, will make up the requisite funds.
ESTIMATED REVENUE.
Detailed financial estimates covering the first 1 0 years of operation are set out in the prospectus. According to the figures
supplied, gross toll revenue should increase by annual stages from £23,000 in 1936 to £34,900 in 1944, and net toll revenue, after
paying all expenses, including sinking fund and first mortgage loan interest, from £l 1,526 in 1936 to £15,871 in 1944.
DEBENTURE CERTIFICATE HOLDERS have majority representation on the board of directors.
The distribution of toil revenue is in the hands of the Public Curator in Queensland.
Adequate provision has been made for the redemption of the loan, and repayment of the debenture certificates, by the establish-
ment of a sinking fund.
CONSTRUCTION has already been commenced, and progress is outlined in the prospectus. All work is under the supervision
of the Main Roads Commissioner.

Though nature smiled in 1930, the col-
lapse of prices spoiled financial results,
and readjustment of the book value of
livestock produced another heavy loss in
’3l. Then drought, which broke towards
the. close of last year, stalked the runs
again, causing further losses of livestock
and adding to overhead. Still, last year’s
sales, etc., were £38,821 better, thanks to
the sharp rise in the price of wool:

Including the allowance for depreciation

net profit of £355 remained, an improve-
ment of £29,385 on the previous year’s
result. The dry spell for the prefs. has
not been broken since 1925.
A comparison of balance-sheet figures

ing to outsiders, mainly the bank, the

£21,228, plant by £1614, livestock by
£BBl9 and wool by £7854. The improve-
ment in the financial position was
£23,199, liabilities exceeding more or less

Hornibrook Highway, Ltd.
This is the concern which is building
a concrete-pile bridge across the mouth
of Hay’s Inlet, thus shortening the route
from Brisbane to Redcliffe, a very popu-
lar seaside resort, by over nine miles, and
connecting up with the main road north
along the coast. The original issue of
£300,000 worth of debentures failed,
mainly because the debenture-holders,
who were then asked to put up all but
a fraction of the cost of the whole ven-
ture, were given little or no say in the
control. This and other defects in the
original proposition have been reme-
died, and the response to the £135,000
of toll-bridge debenture certificates now
offered has been so good that the direc-
tors have decided to close the issue to-
morrow, March 15.
The capital construction is unique.
Shareholders have subscribed £lO,OOO, of
which £5900 has been paid. They have
the sole right to revenue from the sale
of land bought by the Co., rentals, adver-
tising rights, etc., but are not entitled to
any of the toll revenue.
The capital cost of the main undertaking
(£285,000) is being provided by a first-
mortgage loan of £lOO,OOO from the
A.M.P. Society at 4 } p.c. for 20 years,
together with the present certificate issue
of £135,000. The franchise is for 40
years, with the right to charge specified
tolls, chiefly Is. per car carrying not
more than six persons. At the end of
that time the bridge passes to the Gov-
ernment.
Government has the right to take over
the structure at the end of 20 years, or
each five years thereafter, on payment of
compensation, which ensures a return of
the certificate capital plus 8 p.c. p.a. Inci-
dentally, it has guaranteed both principal
and interest on the mortgage.
The position of certificate-holders is
that up to completion of the structure
(about Sept., 1935) they will receive in-
terest at the rate of 5 p.c. p.a. After
that they are entitled to the net proceeds
of toll revenue. This, after paying all
exes., including interest on the mort-
gage, and providing a sinking fund for
the redemption of the loan and repay-
ment of the certificate money, is expected
to return 6 p.c. in the first year and at
least 8 p.c. in the eighth and subse-
quent terms. Everything, of course,
depends upon the toll revenue. In
this connection, estimates, which appear
to be conservatively based upon official
traffic figures, are supported by indepen-
dent experts of repute. Distribution of
the toll revenue is subject to the appro-
val of the Public Curator of Queensland,
who is trustee for the certificate-holders.
The directors are knights Edward
Macartney and William Glasgow, A. G.
Noble, G. Packer, P. J. Symes, A. H.
Langdon and R. D. Kennedy. The first
three represent the certificate-holders,
who at all times are entitled to a majority
on the board.
There is nothing sensational behind the
pegging of prospecting leases at the Pin-
nacles, Broken Hill, says C. C. Freeman,
superintendent of Zinc Corp. Though
it is not yet interested financially, some
of the co.’s staff are assisting to run the
rule over the new areas; Hopes are that
British capital will be forthcoming for
a complete geological survey, and for
such prospecting as may be decided upon.
Thus far stone at the Pinnacles has car-
ried too much silver and not enough lead.
The formations, however, suggest possi-
bilities which warrant thorough pros-
pecting.

During February Bulolo’s three dredges
turned over 635,500 c.y. for 86360 z. of
bullion, containing 58140 z. of fine gold.
With gold at £8 10s., the value of the
output in Australian currency was
£49,419 ; the working profit was £34,060.
The bullion contains about one-third
silver and two-thirds gold. The value of
the silver just about pays the cost of
refining and freight. No. 4 dredge is
expected to begin digging in July, and
the new 4000-h.p. hydro-electric plant
should be ready about November. The
idea of duplicating the generating equip-
ment is mainly to provide against the
possibility of a breakdown, and partly
to gain additional power. J. W. Griffin,
the co.’s technical director, who recently
visited the field, is “confident that the co.
will pay divs. in excess of the prospectus
estimate of 28 p.c.”
* * * *
Mt. Morgan has declared its second
div., 6d. per ss. share, for the March
quarter, payable April 10. The board
anticipates no difficulty in maintaining
that rate, notwithstanding that a lot of
money is to be spent on enlarging plant
and equipment to enable 5000 tons of
ore to be treated weekly. Recently the
co. was handling only 3000 tons per
week. Bigger tonnages should mean
lower costs ; much depends upon whether
the price of gold in Australian currency
holds around its present level. At 21s.
1 Id. the return is a shade over 9 p.c.
on a 40 p.c. div. basis.
* * * *
According to S. L. Shepherd, results
obtained on the May Downs field,
Cloncurry (Q.), have not revealed any
lodes worth following, except on No.
1 Crescent lease. Here, at a depth
of 40ft., a 2ft. section assays 21dwt.
gold and another 2|ft. carries 10dwt.,
while, in the 100 ft. crosscut, a 4ft.
section carries 6|dwt. If these values
continue in the drive, the show should
stand up to the expense of a small mill.
Water, however, will have fo be provided.
Outside of the Crescent the discovery of
small auriferous leaders has prevented
prospecting from flagging.
* * * *
.Mark Eves and his mates, working out
from the bottom of the old opencut at
the Mt. Cobalt mine, Mt. Elliott district
(N.Q.), got 24 tons of cobalt ore, worth
£27 a ton. The lode has never been thor-
oughly worked, and their prospects of
picking up further bunches of cobalt
are good.
During the fortnight that Mt. Wandoo
(N.Q.) worked in January, it sent 150
tons of ore to Chillagoe for only 440 z. of
fine gold. This is much below the aver-
age to date. A body of high-grade ore
in the Carr shaft is now engaging the
management’s attention.
* * * *
Latest developments at Hawkins Hill,
Georgetown (N.Q.), augur well. The
lowest workings have disclosed a reef
about 3ft. wide, one section of which
assayed over soz. and two others 17dwt.
and 3dwt. respectively. It’s one of the
ventures of N.Q. Gold Development Co.

The Westralian Government is losing
two of its geological officials. One, Tor-
rington Blatchford, joined the Mines De-
partment soon after his arrival in Perth
from Sydney in 1897. After four years’
service, he started in private practice, but
rejoined the department in 1912, and,
when not on loan to Freney and other
cos., has been with it ever since, for the
last five years as Chief Government Geo-
logist. Now he links up with the Anglo-
Australian Co. The other, Dr. Lar-
combe, is leaving the job of lecturer in
geology at the Westralian School of
Mines to start on his own account. He
has been 27 years in the Government
service, and has made a special study of
the geological structure of the Kalgoorlie
Golden Mile.

Lake View’s purchase of the Asso-
ciated, on the basis of one Lake View
share for six Associateds, surprised West-
ralian mining men. For 20 years Asso-
ciated had been managed by canny Dun-
can McAulay, and not a saxpence was
wasted. After an 18-year spell, the gold
premium enabled the co. to pay a
couple of 12} p.c. divs. on a capital of
£120,000. When Carl Lindberg inspected
the mine in 1930 he declared that the
main workings were nearing exhaustion,
but that in the south end, towards the
Lake View boundary, there was scope for
exploration of the upper extension of
the Lake View east lode.

The Anglo-Australian Co., one of
Claude de Bernajes’s recent London floats,
is spending money freely on diamond
drills. Two are boring at Kundip, near
Ravensthorpe, two more are being sent to
shows on the Murchison, and others are
on the way from London to Marble Bar
to stab gold-bearing formations in that
distant locality. Meanwhile the co.’s
shares have risen to a premium of over
100 per cent, on the market.
* * * *
De Bernales’s latest float, North Kal-
gurli United, was rushed in London,
where 480,000 shares were offered
and over two million were applied
for. Shareholders have the right till June,
1935, to take up one new share at par
for every two now allotted. The co.’s
blocks, which are on the northern fringe
of the Golden Mile, comprise a number
on which little work has been done for
many years ; none has been explored at
depth.
* * * *
North Kalgurli (W.A.) has bought a
fleet of Diesel-engined trucks, fitted with
the largest balloon tyres in Australia.
Each truck will cart ore from the North’s
shafts to the new treatment plant on
portion of the Perseverance lease, a dis-
tance of about three-quarters of a mile,
and will do 25 journeys a day.

The New Venture, floated a few
months ago to turn old mines at Cool-
gardie and elsewhere to profitable
account, is battling with the Redemption,
adjoining Bayley’s Find. Official state-
ments indicate that, although several
thousand ounces of gold has been won
from the show in the past, one thing
after another prevented it from doing its
best.
* * * *
Ives’s Reward (W.A.) is “reorganising
its shareholdings and debts.” About
£16,000 worth of gold was extracted in a
few years from the co.’s old show, north
of Widgiemooltha, but it finally shut
down, owing to erratic values, short-
sighted control and weak finance. It
may have a chance now that the price of
gold is up.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (New) has extracted
nearly 80,000 oz. of gold from the old
Horseshoe dumps. Operations have been
in full swing for four years, and it will
probably take another two years to re-
treat what remains.

Ore milled on the S. African Rand in
1933 totalled 37,000,000 tons, nearly
2,000,000 tons more than the 1932 figures.
The yield, at 11,000,0000 z., was half a
million ounces less, the average extrac-
tion per ton being 5.864dwt. as against
6.47 ldwt. Revenue, at £66,854,000 ster-
ling, showed an increase of £18,000,000.
Working profit at £30,691,000 represented
an increase of £16,000,000, the profit per
ton being 16s. 6d. against Bs. 4d. Divs.
aggregated £13,600,000, an increase of
over £4,500,000. Revised ore reserves of
six of the biggest mines all show sub-
stantial increases.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(1) Size and sort of crucible to smelt about
jib. of gold specimens ? (2) What flux should
be used ? (3) What flux should be used for a
tin-ore dry assay ? —486.
(1) Use H. Battersea crucible or preferably a
graphite crucible of the same capacity, if speci-
mens rich in gold. Advisable to warm graphite
crucible before placing in fire with charge. (2)
Flux )lb. of crushed specimens with lib. of
sodium bicarbonate and £lb. of borax glass.
(3) For rich tin ore or concentrates, 10 grammes
of crushed sample requires 30 grammes of
potassium or sodium cyanide.

“I’m No Angel”
This film, which has for its heroine a
member of the world’s oldest calling, is
one of two that representatives of the
R.C., Episcopal and Methodist churches
in the U.S.A. objected to recently as vice-
propaganda. The other was “Design for
Living.” Hollywood’s inane defence in
both cases was that the themes, however
unpleasant, have been “handled in a
light-hearted spirit”! The worldling will
object on other grounds. Just as the men
in “Design for Living,” though good
actors, are not the kind who would share
a woman, so Mae West, though a good
actress, is not the kind who would attract
men in droves. She is too old. In real
life the female she portrays would long
since have graduated into the senior
branch of her profession, and would be
having periodical brushes with the police
as proprietress of a house of ill-fame.
Miss West’s chief appeal is to girls. There
was a noticeable preponderance of them
at the Prince Edward on the opening
night, and the women’s sections of the
Sydney papers have had many references
since to “glamorous Mae” and “seduc-
tive Mae West.”
She is first seen doing a danse du
ventre in a booth. Then she becomes
a lion-tamer in a circus. Her object, as
she explains, is to “get in with the silk-
hat crowd.” A handsome young silk-
hat wearer soon materialises and sets
her up in a flat. Then she meets Cary
Grant, who is even richer: he is on the
point of marrying her when one of her
innumerable previous lovers emerges
from gaol and causes him to back out.
She starts a breach of promise action,
appears for herself, and so confounds
Grant’s witnesses in cross-examination
that he is won round, and the fade-out
leaves them in each other’s arms.
Miss West is responsible for the plot
and all the dialogue. She is presented as
one who has fought life and the law and
won. Men are dirt beneath her feet;
putty in her hands. Nothing perturbs
her. The fiancee of one of her lovers
calls and implores her to give him up.
She throws the girl out, then strolls across
the room, head back, hips swaying, cigar-
ette-holder poised aloft. “Peel me a
grape,” she says blandly to one of her
adoring nigger-retainers. In the court
scene she dominates the Judge, enthralls
the jury, pulverises the witnesses—all as
easy as kiss your hand. She varies her
Rabelaisian quips at the expense of men
with sudden, irrelevant yowls of a senti-
mental nature —in short, she is consis-
tently the kind of philosophical old out-
law who may be encountered almost any
night at a certain type of British or
American night club, and almost any
morning at a police court.
“This Day and Age”
“Red Page” referred recently to the
English tendency to turn penny “bloods”
into 7s. 6d. novels. “This Day and Age”
shows the same idea at work in the talkie
field. In this Cecil de Mille production
a deal of money and technical ability
has been lavished on a boys’ story.
Charles Bickford is a small-town gang-
ster who murders a benevolent little
tailor (Harry Green). The boys of the
local high school start to investigate, and
the gangster murders one of them. Then
the entire school is organised against
him. The leading boys kidnap him and
extract a written confession in what looks
like an abandoned castle with all the
high school students, except the co-eds,
looking on. There is a love interest,
the pace is terrific, and the photography
is extraordinarily good.
“Orient Express”
Let’s hope the latest Capitol film is
the last we shall see of train films. On
this occasion the train runs from Ostend
to Constantinople. An international
flavor is given to the fantastic proceed-
ings by Herbert Mundin and Una
O’Connor (Cockney), Ralph Morgan (a
Communist, made up to resemble G. 8.5.)
and Norman Foster (an immensely
wealthy young American in the date
business who makes botanical references
to sex culled from his technical know-
ledge). In addition we have a crook
made up to resemble Adolf Menjou, and
several ladies, the most beauteous of
whom is Heather Angel. Having got a
job as a dancer in Belgrade or Stam-
boul or somewhere, Heather boards the
train without a ticket and faints from
sheer starvation as soon as she meets Mr.
Foster. The rest is easy. On the Yugo-
slavian border most of the characters are
arrested while Hungarian gipsies dance
through the train singing and fiddling
excerpts from Liszt’s Sixth Rhapsody.
Heather assists Ralph Morgan to escape
from a dungeon, and Mr. Foster drives
through the night amid forests full of
Californian vegetation until the time is
ripe for Heather to fall into his arms.
The Menjou-like person does a Sydney
Carton stunt to cover the escape. The
whole business has no more relation to
life than doorknobs have to eggs.
“Saturday’s Millions”
Another football epic. Millions of
dahlers are gambled on the result, and
the fathers of the players go crazy.
At quarter-time the youths are all laid
out and skilled physicians battle to keep
them going. Hero Robert Young plays
with a broken right hand, swoons from
pain periodically and drops the pass that
would have won his side the match. But
everybody (in the film) understands that a
100 per cent. American who wanted to
win a football match for his side would
go into it while utterly incapacitated, and
that the heroine (in this case, Leila
Hyams) would be unworthy of her noble

He instals her in a hotel, and even

The deception of the trio from Spain

N’Yark society men. Altogether a good

general level of the acting is high.

The cast is headed by Chic Sale, a
retired engineer who has a granddaughter
and a pensioned-off railway engine called
“Minnie” to keep him company.

Chic’s grandson’s life and falls in love

“Three-cornered Moon”
A most amusing Sydney Regent film
which takes its name from that of a
mine in which Mary Boland, widow, loses
her fortune when the depression descends
upon New York.
She and her four children are an
irresponsible crew. Mary Boland potters
about the kitchen, annoys the Polish cook
and haggles with the laundryman. Her
son (William Bakewell), a Harvard
graduate, cares for nothing but amateur
theatricals. His brother (Wallace Ford)
neglects his law studies for an inane
flapper. A third son (Tom Brown) is a
brainless college boy. The daughter
(Claudette Colbert) is engaged to Hardie
Albright, who thinks he can write,
despises work and lives on others.

“The Ghoul”
At .Sydney’s Civic —it has thrown over
its all-Australian policy, presumably
because of lack of material —is another
Boris Karloff film. Karloff is an
Egyptologist who believes that a jewel
which he owns will, if it goes to the
grave with him, procure him entrance to
Paradise. He threatens if it is stolen to
return for it. He dies with the jewel
bandaged to his hand. It is stolen and he
returns. Karloff is as terrifying as ever,
but the chief interest of the film lies in
two excellent characterisations —Karloff’s
lawyer (Cedric Hardwicke) and servant
(Ernest Thesiger), who steals the jewel
for his master’s heirs.
“Britannia of Billingsgate”
The proprietress of a cafe near the fish -
market has her voice recorded by accident
on a sound film. The director decides to
star her in a new picture and she becomes
famous overnight. The family, dad and
the two children, have a good time on
ma’s wages, and the rest is according to
samples seen dozens of times before.
Violet Loraine is the lady; Gordon
Harker is her husband.

Alfredo Catalani has a niche in musi-
cal history as the first Italian composer
of opera who distinctly showed the
Wagner influence. His “Loreley,” broad-
cast one evening last week by the A.B.C.’s
opera organisation, has never been popu-
lar outside Italy, and is nearly forgotten
there. It contains, however, some lus-
cious orchestration and some fine drama-
tic arias, to which full justice was done.
Soloists Madame Goossens-Viceroy, Eve-
lyn Lynch, Lionello Cecil, Walter Kings-
ley and Franco Izal found their respective
tasks congenial, and the choral singing
was fine.

Sydney’s Radio Exhibition, which
opened stodgily and incomplete, as is the
manner of exhibitions held in the
Town Hall, developed in its later
days some features intended to appeal
to the large mass of mankind that
takes no delight in the number of
valves in a radio. Best of these features,
from any point of view of the man in the
street, was the Pashometer. The instru-
ment registered sex appeal. The very
first afternoon it was installed there was
a miniature riot. The police were called
in to quell it. It seemed to be such a
very important riot that Metropolitan
Superintendent Mackay had a look at
it. Grasping the essential of the remedy,
which seemed to be a matter of lessening
the pressure round the machine by
barring at least half of the people who
wanted to get at it, Mackay waved them
all back. He submitted himself to the
test, and the dial registered 55 out of a
possible 100. The superintendent looked
at the diaU-hard —and delivered his dic-
tum. “Ladies only,” he said.

A neat notion, but one which will, of
course, kill itself in a day or two, has
been tried by the A.B.C. recently.
In between items over the radio a whis-
pered conversation is broadcast. “If you
take my advice, Bill,” says one whisperer,
“you won’t do anything silly. You want
to be cautious in a matter .like this. I
had a very sad experience.” Here the
whisper sinks to inaudibility and con-
tinues like that for several seconds,
emerging into daylight, as it were, with
“and now, whenever I want an overcoat,
I buy it at Snurkums.” That’s a branch
of advertising a newspaper can’t touch.

The Nelson Trio, engaged by the
A.B.C. to purvey chamber music, gave
their first recital one night last week, play-
ing together, as their most notable
achievement, Smetana’s G Minor Trio.
Chopin and Debussy numbers were given
by the pianist, the ’cellist played a Popper
tarantelle and the violinist played the
“La Folia” variations of Corelli. These
three girls, all under 20, have the sym-
pathy necessary to good trio playing, and
their recitals are well worth listening to.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Jackaburra”: Having made some
keen purchases, the old chap with the
twinkling eyes asked whether we would
deliver the goods free. It should have
been extra, but I said we would, and he
gave the address. “The carter has only
to ask anyone round about and they’ll
direct him to my place,” he said. “Been
there over 40 years.” After a moment’s
mental calculation: “Matter of fact, it’s
41 years and three months.” Suddenly
he grew more confidential: “It’s a long
time to live on the one place. Too long.
I’ll never do it again.”
“Jindivick”: A dark, dirty night, and
a strange scraping, snuffling sound in the
house. I crept out in my socks and
grabbed a chair for a weapon. Then my
fingers came in contact with a hard, hairy
object, which moved back out of reach.
A snort and a hot blast of moist, foul
air full into my face. I raised the chair
in both hands and smashed it down in
front of me. The intruder plunged
violently, collided with the table and
crashed through the door leading on to
the verandah. Grabbing a torch from
where it hung by the doorway I flashed
“I see Brown’s men beat us home again to-night, sir.”
"Don’t matter, lad — we’ll beat ’em out in the mornin’.”
it towards the outer darkness. Through
the open doorway there floated an indig-
nant “moo-oo,” accompanied by a spite-
ful “swish-crack” as a much-ruffled house
cow beat the verandah-post with her tail.
* * * *
“Chizz”: Looks as if M.L. will have
to cross off the native rat from the ex-
tinct list. A party of climbers saw a
strange animal in the Edwards Valley;
Canterbury, a small, rotund beastie with a
long snout and longish hair with a bright-
colored end. The description tallies with
that of the specimen in the Canterbury
Museum. Despite its rarity, the rat
showed no signs of timidity and dozed
within reach of the climbers as they were
eating a meal.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: “O. W. Waireki’s” Maori
bride (B. 21/2/’34) reminds me of a
N.S.W. North Coast abo. who arrived at
the local registry office and arranged for
a wedding. The parties were from Stoney
Gully Reserve, five miles out. “What
time do you want the ceremony?” asked
the registrar. “Oh, whenever Nellie comes
along,” was the reply. “I got a lift on a
lorry —she had to walk.”
He * * *
“X.”: A Goulburn man writes that he
has seen a brown snake 7ft. lOjrin. long
near the local weir and asks if it is a
record. That snake was only a worm,
though perhaps as much as can be ex-
pected of a region where the only bever-
age is water. On the McArthur River
(N.T.) I once killed one which was lift.
4in. from tip to nose, and that in a dry
region. One of my mates, however, said
that he had seen a serpent twice as long
in a Darwin pub, but it probably was not
a true brown. Anyway, it was noth-
ing to the kind which used to live around
the northern mining camps, and which
had to tie knots in itself in order to keep
its nose and tail out of the draught when
it slept full length under a fallen tele-
graph post.
* * * *
“King T.”: “Rather prosperous-looking
place you have here,” I said to the even
more prosperous-looking proprietor of
the hotel, “but haven’t you made a mis-
take in the name? You’ve called it the
Eight Seas, and everybody knows there
are only seven seas.” “That’s just it,”
he replied. “Things used to be rotten.
Everybody went past without stopping ; so
I decided to change the name of the joint.
It worked ; right away every person who
passed thought he was the first to see
the mistake. They began stopping their
cars after they had passed and coming
back to tell me about it while they
washed the dust out of their throats.
The joke eventually got into guide books,
but they still, like you, come in to tell me.
How’s business? Never better.”

“Wok”: Kookaburras in the Heyfield
district (Vic.) are fond of river mussels,
which are plentiful thereabouts, and have
made a family cracking-place along part
of a post-and-rail fence. Having fished
his mussels, Jack flies off to the fence and
there dashes the shells against the top
rail until the contents can be pecked out.
Crows adopt another method ; they drop
the mussels from a good height on hard
metal roads.
*. * * *
“Matilda”: “Tumoulin” falls over him-
self in his anxiety to prove Rod Quinn
wrong (B. 21/2/’34). It isn’t usual for
a man to pad up to 50 miles a day ; but
neither Frank Gaunt nor “Pongello”
Harry Clinton (I knew both) thought he’d
done anything wonderful when he’d
slung that distance behind him. “Pon-
gello” wouldn’t have horses —reckoned
they were too slow if he wanted to get
anywhere in a hurry. “Tumoulin” says a
man “can place a canvas bag of water
on the edge of a razor blade or on the
point of a needle without piercing the
canvas.” He can. He can also, ten
minutes later, accidentally brush the same
bag with the back of his hand and burst
it. I don’t hold a brief for Rod Quinn’s
technique; but I do say that before
“Tumoulin” can teach Rod anything he
needs to learn a lot himself.
“You can imagine how I felt, my dear. I DO think the Egg Board or some-
body should publish a book on ‘What Every Pullet Should Know.’”
“Wilfremon”: Dad went up to the
hotel clerk and asked for stationery. “Are
you a guest here?” the young woman
demanded. “No fear,” replied Dad.
“I’m payin’ 15 bob a day!”
“Larrapinta”: It used to be thought
that Binghi was ignorant of the art of
fire-making by striking flint, but Clarence
Long, last full-blooded survivor of the
tribes that used to roam over the swamps
and forests of the s.-e. of South Aus.,
has shown otherwise. Handed some flint
implements found near his tribal
grounds, he struck sparks from one with
the back of his pocket-knife, remarking
that his people made fire that way long
before the coming of the whites. He
added that there was only one stone
which would knock fire off the flint; it
was to be found near Cape Jaffa in one
particular spot. Long’s claim has been
proved correct by the finding, on the
site of an old abo. camping-ground, of
two rounded lumps of metal scarred all
over. Analysis proved them to be
meteoric iron. The scarcity of this metal
would explain why the art never spread
elsewhere.
* * * *
“S.M.W.”: The black - and - white
oyster-catcher is a well-known inhabitant
of our northern N. S. Wales beaches.
With red legs and long red bill it is
easily recognised. Whether it opens
oysters or not is questionable; but
it is an expert on pipis. At about
half-tide it hunts along the sand at the
end of the water, probing with its knife-
shaped bill until the latter is caught be-
tween the valves of a closing pipi. Then
the bird sits back and pulls, and up
comes the pipi clamped on the end of
the bill. It is promptly banged on the
sand until the beak is driven hard in
between the valves of the shell and
divides the muscles that hold them to-
gether. The shell opens out and the
bird eats the mollusc within at its
leisure. Try the experiment with a knife-
blade. But don’t push too hard or the
muscle will be divided at once.
* * * *
“Tom Thumb”: The cat with his nine
lives is in the kindergarten class com-
pared to a turtle. I caught a young
loggerhead, just hatched, and kept him
in a dinghy half-filled with sea water for
over three months before he turned up
his toes. And in the whole of that baby
life the poor little cuss never ate any-
thing. I gathered seaweed and all that
sort of stuff for him, but I might just
as well have offered him blancmange.
I didn’t know till afterwards, when I was
acting as foster-father to the next clutch
of loggerheads, that they didn’t eat sea-
weed, as all good little turtles are sup-
posed to do. Loggies prefer fish flesh,
oysters and other living marine crea-
tures ; they leave vegetarian diet to their
cousins the greenbacks, which are tinned
and labelled for aldermen.
* * * *
“Raeakiaki”: None of “Moseilikatse’s”
explanations (B. 21/2/’34) fits an ex-
perience of the late Elsdou Best, the
greatest student of Henare. Surveying in
the Taranaki bush, Best was told by a
Maori assistant that an Otaki chief
known to him had called in to say good-
bye when on his way to the spirit land.
Best noted down the time, and a wire
next day showed that death had taken
place a few minutes earlier than the time
at which the spirit was supposed to have
called. Telling me the yarn, Best de-
clared there was no logical explanation
to account for the news having travelled,
since his assistant had been in communi-
cation with no one and Henare at that
time did not send messages by trumpets
or flutes.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: A tenner was paid the other
day for a dingo scalp at Gordon Brook
(Clarence River, N.S.W.), where wild
dogs are again a pest despite a hundred-
year war on them and a ten-shilling
bonus for scalps. Some time back £6O
was paid at Tenterfield for a dog that
had eluded capture for ten years. The
Tambo Terror, a marauder that infested
the upper part of the Barcoo, was equally
valuable to the man who got him ; and
Old Snowy, another Barcoo notable, was
worth 44 guineas. The corpse of Bullock-
foot, a notorious W.A. killer, brought
£BO ; but the biggest price was paid for
a cunning brute that ranged the Bathurst
district. For his scalp harassed graziers
had subscribed £lOO. The man who
lifted it trailed poisoned treacle along a
sandy pad. Warrigal got some on his
feet and licked it off.
AFTERMATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Before the freshening sou’-west wind the scat-
tered clouds fleet past;
There’s a touch of chill and dampness in the
fingers of the blast;
O'erhead the sky is velvet black, with stars like
specks of light,
And moonshine over all, soft and white.
The storm, in impotent assault, has raged and
passed away,
A foe that roars but cannot harm, that strikes
but cannot slay.
Not desolation strews his path, but breeze and
soft, dim light,
And wild things singing through the night.
The northern sky is still disturbed by flash and
roar of strife,
But all around are peace and sound of re-
awakened life:
The bullfrogs in the *waterhole, the horsebells
in the lane,
And the fragrance of the earth after rain.
And through the night, in wondrous flight, the
bat and nightjar pass,
The merry crickets scrape their bows in every
tuft of grass,
The mopoke sounds his solemn note, faint
and from far away,
And the frogs toll the prelude of the day.

THE FIRST GUINEA.
Until further notice a guinea will be
added every week to the office cheque
for the “ Aboriginally” placed first by
the editor.
It goes this week to Vernon A. Lee,
Greenway-avenue, Hobart ( Tas .), for
the following :
The visitor to the assay office
seemed fairly intelligent. All the
steps in the assay for gold were
explained to him —the pot fusion,
scorification, cupellation and the
parting of gold from the silver.
The assay balance intrigued him,
so we weighed his name, written on
paper with pencil. He saw the final
gold prill from the assay weighed
and calculated to ounces per ton.
The gold prill was then emptied
into the small porcelain cup kept
in the balance-case for that pur-
pose. The visitor gazed thought-
fully at the collection of tiny prills
which just covered the bottom of
the cup. “How long has it taken
to collect that much gold?” he
asked. “About two years,” we
replied. “Good gracious!” he ex-
claimed. “Does assaying pay ?”


“H.C.M.”: On Kooba station (N.S.W.)
a large crossbred wether always leads
the mobs into the yards, through the
races, into the shed and finally right
up to the catching pens. He is
worth his weight in combs and cutters
because of the time he saves. Goats are
often employed as leaders, but this is
the first case I’ve heard of where a sheep
does the job.

“H.L.D.”: During the elections last
April a car bringing in some outback
postal votes became marooned between
two creeks some way out from Marble
Bar (W.A.). After the party had safely
crossed the first creek they found the
second running a banker and impassable.
As there was no earthly chance of reach-
ing the marooned car and occupants
(even the abos. refused to face the cur-
rents), Clerk-of-Courts Reynolds con-
ceived the idea of constructing and flying
a kite over the creek. This was done,
and the small parcel of voting papers was
attached to the tail and successfully
landed on the other side.

“Tooronga”: Chris Cotswold, keeper
of the lions at Melbourne Zoo, is making
walking-sticks from left-over pieces of the
hide of Bill the hippo., who ate a tennis
“You should speak to Edna. It isn’t decent the way she goes about since
she’s been to Palm Beach.”
“Have sense, woman! Think of the time she saves gettin’ dressed in the
mornin’.”
ball and died. The hide is cut into strips
and thoroughly dried; the pieces are
Pl ane d down. They are finished
off with fine glass-paper, highly polished
with a special mixture and mounted with
a silver top. It takes a long time to do
each one, but they look smart when
finished. There is a long waiting list of
buyers..
“Soso”: An electric train service is not
the only thing which rodents have dis-
organised (B. 21/2/’34). A few years ago
on two occasions rats got into the under-
ground workings of Broken Hill’s tele-
phone service, gnawed through the lead
casing of the cables and then made a nest
of the paper wrappings which insulate the
wires. In the process they put many
local ’phones out of order.
* * * *
“A.E.E.”: Horses appreciate the care
they get in military camps. When the
Tas. forces go into camp half
the neddies used are from the
remount depot and half from
near-by farms, whose owners
are awake to the value of in-
tense grooming, feeding and
exercising. At a recent camp
one horse was sent in very
much the worse for wear. On
the evening before breaking
camp he was taken six miles
home to the farmer, who ex-
pressed his delight at the trans-
formation. A fortnight in the
army, however, had convinced
Dobbin of the advantages of a
military career: and at six
next morning he was back at
his old post at the camp and
neighing for a feed. He got it.
* *
“Soustralia”: This placard
was beside a country pub’s
telephone: “If you write on
your own walls, please write
on ours. We want you to feel
at home.” The wall was un-
marked. It reminded me of
a friend who had been suffer-
ing from the depredations of
fowl-stealers. He tacked on the
fowlhouse gate a poster with
the words: “Please help yourself to
the fowls, but don’t wake the bulldog ;
its barking annoys us.” As the bulldog’s
kennel had been moved from its usual
position to a vantage point near the
fowlhouse, the notice had its effect.
Another devotee of the gentle art of
sarcasm was an Adelaide University pro-
fessor who remarked to the inveterate
latecomer: “I wouldn’t mind you coming
in late for lectures if you didn’t wake
the other students.”

“Te Babarantiko”: If the cocoanut
crab were touchy he would, I’m sure, feel
hurt at consistent misrepresentation of his
appearance and habits—by “Paumotus”
(B. 7/2/’34), for instance. Birgus latro
stores up fat, but not “under his tail-
flap.” He has no flap. His after-half
resembles the bulbous abdomen of a Gar-
gantuan spider ; the entrails are packed
in thick oil. Poke him gently in the
abdomen and his claws and legs will
stiffen with a sudden spasm. The Pacific
Islanders nowhere discourage the giant
land-lobster. He is scarce, is toothsome,
easily caught and duly appreciated. Strips
of tins and slippery pandanus-leaf are
fastened around palm-boles, not to dis-
courage cocoanut crabs, but to prevent
rats laying aloft,
* * * *
“Aug”: Here’s an even stranger case
than “Mako’s” (B. 21/2/’34). Some
Naracoorte (S.A.) lads made a car trip
to Broken Hill, and at one of the camps
en route two of them started a mock
duel with carving-knives. One stumbled,
fell and cut his nose off. The other lad
snatched the severed snout, put it back
into place, and the patient held it there
the rest of the drive to Broken Hill,
where a doctor stitched it on. It’s slightly
crooked to-day, but the victim says it is
quite all right, except that “I feel as if
“And after we’re married we’ll be able to go through life hand-in-hand.”
“’Cept when we’re milkin’.”
I’m going to blow me eyes out every
time I sneeze.”
* * * *
“Ben Nevis”: Blackberries stand in
high walls by the road at Robertson
(N.S.W.) and ramble over the fields in
massed formation. Sixty tons of the
fruit was sent off by rail last season. A
man bought a block of 200 acres covered
with the pest. “Good feed for goats and
sheep,” he declared. Swinging into a
veritable mountain of the stuff one day,
he crashed his hook through a glass
window. Further excavation uncovered
a cottage. Now he has a home among
the goats and sheep—and blackberries.
* * * *
“Wippegong”: Out-of-doors tea was
over, when a thick, shiny black beetle
about an inch long dropped on the table.
He plodded around
until we put a saucer
over him. Pause;
then the saucer began
to glide over the cloth.
We made it two
saucers. Another
pause ; then off again
at the original pace.
A cup was added,
then a large tomato ;
each time he stopped
long enough to feel
the extra load, then
on he’d go. After the
tomato had been
some time dizzily joy-
riding, we took pity
on the captive and
lifted the load. Grate-
ful? Not a bit. First
of all he rushed the
butter-dish and heaved
it inches. Then he
went for a big plate
and shoved it in the
opposite direction.
Fearing for the lamp,
we replaced the saucers ; these he hauled
to the edge of the table, where he crashed
to the ground and disappeared. Unlike
their small brown cousins, these black
beetles never arrive in numbers. Just
as well, perhaps.
* * * *
“S.W.K.”: The coast in the vicinity
of Montague Island (N.S.W.), which has
lately sprung into prominence, piscatori-
ally speaking, has always been noted for
great variety and plenitude of fish. But
it is even more noted for the number
of crabs trawled off there. The island is
literally the home of the shaggy sponge-
crab, that brownish-colored crustacean
which uses a sponge for a topcoat —or,
failing that, a colony of sea-squirts.
These crabs offer no resistance whatever
to capture, relying exclusively on camou-
flage to save them. The hooking of a
few more 4001 b. striped marlin will make
Montague Island a Mecca for big-game
fishermen.
“Dangie”: I hope the camel that tried
to get through the eye of a needle had
better luck than the six-foot-six black
crawler that tried to negotiate a l|in.
auger hole in a post the other day. When
he started there was nothing in the hole
but 12-gauge barbed wire, but after the
event it held a corpse which was pie to
a travelling photographer. Reminds me
of the commercial traveller who tried to
get into Heaven. He was a prudent man,
and had provided for a long drought.
His hip flask jammed in the gate, and the
Devil, who was outside, pinched it; so
then. Heaven being no longer worth while
to him, the poor lad turned sadly round
and went to the other place, where, at
any rate, there was a strong smell of
the crathur if none to swallow.
* * *
“X.S.”: A new use for metho. as a
beverage was explained by an addict at
a Melbourne court recently. He said he
would indulge again, however much he
was punished, because it was good for
his rheumatism.
* * * *
“Double Disc”: “Gumblegubbin” (B.
28/ 2/ ’34) reminds me of a well-authen-
ticated story of the bad old days in Fiji.
A chief had been on a raid in a seagoing
canoe. On the return journey a sudden
squall capsized the craft. Efforts to right
it proved fruitless, so the chief ordered
all hands to swim for the shore, about a
mile or so away, first forming a circle
and placing himself in the middle. Sharks
arrived and started to dispose of the
circle, which kept closing ranks as members
disappeared. Five men and the chief
reached the shore. I heard the tale from
the lips of the hoary old sinner himself
when at Sigatoka some years ago.
* * * *
“Barang”: During the hearing of an
opium-smoking prosecution an ancient
Chinese protested that he had smoked
chandu all his life, and mentioned that
Chinese were not debarred from buying
unlimited quantities of spirits, which did
his countrymen much more harm than the
daily pipe. While opium continues to be
manufactured the Customs will never suc-
ceed in preventing its entry, and the Gov-
ernment should permit the sale in small
quantities under strict supervision. Prac-
tically every Asiatic city has its chandu
shops, and statistics issued by the F.M.S.
Government show that less than one per
cent, of smokers suffer any ill-effects.
For three years part of my job was to
issue a quarterly ration of chandu to
each of 50 Chinese boys and coolies, and,
apart from a little extra indulgence for
a couple of days after the new issue, each
man invariably made his supply last the
required time. Once only did the drug
lead to trouble. Soo Hing was lucky at
fan-tan, and soon held all the available
cash on the island, as well as a lien on
the following quarter’s wages. Opium
became the stake of the losers, and Soo
Hing soon held all that, too, and would
only sell on exorbitant terms. Threats
were made, and one morning Soo was
missing, as also was the station doctor’s
new 22-footer. He took with him five
pounds of opium and a thousand dollars,
but, as we were 1500 miles from the
nearest mainland, I doubt if he made
landfall.

“It takes a mighty lot of blokes to make a
world,” confided Bung,
“And some go up and some go down, and

He poured some milk into his rum and toss’d

The Outsider.
BY P. A. DARBYSHIRE.
FROM the day Johnson joined the
staff of the Department of Rounda-
bouts (Steam) as a temporary clerk
I felt that he was never likely to be
really one of us.
Perhaps I should explain that the De-
partment of Roundabouts (Steam) is the
most important department of the entire
Ministry for Public Amusements and that
I am one of its higher officials.
We had been overworked and under-
paid for years, but finally Mr. Briggs,
our worthy chief, persuaded Mr. Hat-
chett, our Minister (of course, through
Mr. Jimson, our Permanent Under-Secre-
tary), to let us have help. We were
worked to death.
Mr. Hatchett agreed to a temporary
clerkship which was to be made per-
manent if the successful applicant proved
satisfactory. There was the usual
scramble for the job and somehow this
Johnson got it.
I found him waiting outside the office
next morning when I arrived to open up.
“Always open at ten past?” he asked.
“What of it?” said I.
“Pardonable curiosity,” he grinned.
“I’m one of the mob now.”
“Look, Mr. Johnson,” I said severely,
“so long as you are here on time don’t
worry about anybody else.”
I told Mr. Briggs when he came in.
“He won’t reign long here if that’s his
attitude,” said Mr. Briggs.
He instructed me to explain things to
Johnson and I decided to give him one
of the easier tasks first.
“Among the many jobs in this depart-
ment,” I said, “we collect a tax from the
proprietors of steam roundabouts. On
every roundabout there is a device which
records the. number of revolutions it
makes. Every month we get a return of
the number of revolutions for the month
from each proprietor, with an affidavit.
“We take that number and add it to
the proprietor’s previous grand total,
divide the result by the number of months
he’s had his license and call the result
his Monthly Quotient. In order to get
his Daily Quotient we divide the Monthly
Quotient by the average number of days
in every month since he got his license
originally. As an illustration, we’ll say
that it’s 30.327816. That’s near enough
for all practical purposes ; we rarely go
beyond six places of decimals. There’s
no use making work.
“We multiply the result by six, and
that gives us our Weekly Quotient.
“Once you have that, it’s fairly plain
sailing. We multiply it by whatever the
proprietor charges for a ride, making due
allowance for children —.637159 of an
adult. You multiply the result of that cal-
culation by the number of people car-
ried on each trip and you have the
amount of money the proprietor has
taken, theoretically, for the month. We
call it the Theoretical Monthly Takings.”
“Don’t you think, Mr. Sniggs,” he said,
“that it would be simpler and quicker
for him to make a declaration that he’s
taken so much for the month?”
“Mr. Johnson,” I said severely, “you
have been in this department exactly
forty minutes and already you are telling
us how to run it.”
“Sorry,” he replied.
“Now,” I said, “you have this Theore-
tical Monthly Taking—the T.M.T., as we
call it. Divide it by 960 in order to get
the farthings (we tax on so much in the
farthing) and then divide the result by
4.089672 and multiply that result by
3.78624 and you get what we call the
Taxable Quotient. The T.Q., not the
Q.T., you understand, although some-
times in fun we call it that.
“Stamper, a clerk of my own grade,
gets the Theoretical Monthly Passengers
by somewhat similar means. Then we
both take our individual results to Sprag-
gitt, our acting-sub-chief clerk, to make
the final calculations and arrive at the
actual tax payable. You will learn that
under Section CCLXXII of our Act
nobody under Class Vile is allowed to
declare the amount of tax.”
“Is that all?” he asked.
“For the time being,” I said. “Do
you think you grasp it?”
“Oh, quite,” he said flippantly. “Two
quites.”
We cease work at six past five, as you
probably know, and just as we were
going out that afternoon along came an
old fellow who runs some roundabouts
somewhere on the South Coast.
We ignored him, of course. I don’t
believe in being rude to the public, but
it must be taught to come in office hours.
I chanced to look behind me and
found Johnson talking to the fellow.
“No, this isn’t the Department for
Electric Roundabouts,” he said. “It’s the
Department for Roundabouts (Steam).”
“Show me which room it’s in.”
“It’s in another building in another
part of the city.”
“It is, is it? An’ where’s the Depart-
ment for ’And-driven Roundabouts?
I’ve got one of them, too.”
“That,” said Johnson with a cheeky
grin, “is in yet another building in yet
another part of the city.”
“Is it?” roared the uncouth brute.
“Well, if yer ask me, I’d say the depart-
ment’s run by a pack o’ lunatics.”
“I shouldn’t be surprised if you were
right,” said Johnson.
Every he showed plainly that he
would never do in such a department
as ours. He poked fun at everything and
everybody, and, although he scored some
cheap laughter from the juniors, most
of us senior men were disgusted.
To endure the man’s buffoonery in
office hours was bad enough, but one
evening he had the audacity to put me
in a terrible position.
It was a Friday evening and Mrs.
Sniggs and 1 were coming home from
the local market. As usual, I was loaded
up with the Sunday joint, a cabbage,
some nice little pickling onions, and
so on.
Suddenly I received a tremendous
thump between the shoulders. I looked
behind and saw Johnson grinning at me.
Obviously he was drunk, or nearly so.
“Hullo, Sniggs, old boy!” he said. “On
the strict Q.T., how are the little T.Qs.?”
“I am quite well,” I said shortly, feel-
ing rather disconcerted. Mrs. S. was
looking at me sternly.
“And this is the missus, I suppose?”
he chuckled, grabbing Mrs. S.’s hand.
“How are you, Mrs. Sniggs?”
“You have the advantage of me,” she
said icily.
“Why, I’m Johnson,” he said. “From
the office, y’ know. And, by Jove, talk-
ing of the office, I must say that your
old man’s the life of the place. You
should see him among the T.M.Ts. He
certainly makes ’em sit up and do tricks.
And as for the D.Qs. —well, they jump
when they see him coming.”
“Indeed?” asked Mrs. S., looking hard
at me.
“Did he ever tell you about the day
he tried to take Miss Sprightly’s pink
slip off her?” he roared. “She swore she
wouldn’t let him have it, but he got it
after a bit of a tussle. Oh, he’s got a
way with the women, all right.”
“Horace! ” cried Mrs. S., her eyes blaz-
ing at me.
“Well, cheerio, Mrs. Sniggs. Glad to
have met you,” roared Johnson. “Chin,
chin, Sniggs, you old roue, you!”
With that he gave me another violent
shove and I dropped the pickling onions.
As I was groping to pick them up I
heard Mrs. S. hiss: “If that’s true and
I can prove it, I’ll divorce you, Horace.”
It was a terrible situation, and it was
a long time before I could persuade Mrs.
S. that the pink slip was an official form
printed on pink paper, and that although
there had been some little argument be-
tween the girl and me it had been by no
means as violent as he had suggested.
Indeed, I am not sure even now that she
really believes me.
However, the three months passed
eventually, and I felt some satisfaction in
knowing that Johnson’s time was short.
There was no possibility of his appoint-
ment being confirmed, and it was no
matter for wonder. Certainly he did his
work well enough, but he simply did not
enter into the spirit of the department.
His calm air of confidence that he
would be kept on was rather amusing.
Mr. Briggs kept him on tenterhooks
until the end.
Johnson pretended to be not at all
anxious on the last day of his appoint-
ment, although he knew Mr. Briggs must
give his decision that day.
At five o’clock Mr. Briggs had still not
spoken, and we were just about to close
up when he came out of his room.
“Mr. Johnson,” he said sternly, “I
should like to see you for a moment.”
“A dozen,” said Johnson with a wink
at one of the girls. He went into Mr.
Briggs’s room, and as I had occasion
to go to the strong-room, which adjoins,
I happened to overhear them.
“Mr. Johnson,” said Mr. Briggs, “I
cannot recommend your appointment.”
“Have you any fault to find with my
work?” asked Johnson.
“Only in a way,” Said Mr. Briggs.
“But I do my work quite satisfactorily,”
Johnson persisted.
“Oh, quite,” admitted Mr. Briggs.
“But, you see”....
“Then, that being so,” Johnson cut in,
“I can give you two good reasons why you
should recommend my appointment.”
“By all means do so.”
“Well, the first is that Bill Hatchett,
our Minister, is the wife’s brother,” said
Johnson. “And the second is that old
Jimson is my dad’s cousin.”
“Oh,” said Mr. Briggs in quite a dif-
ferent voice. “I have the highest respect
and admiration for both Mr. Hatchett
and Mr. Jimson —the very highest, Mr.
Johnson. Tell me, Mr. Johnson, how is
Mr. Jimson’s sciatica?”
In other words, Johnson’s appointment
was recommended. Of course, it would
be unfair to blame Mr. Briggs.
However, there is always a silver lining.
Since his permanent appointment John-
son has gradually changed, and seems to
be realising the importance of being a
member of the Department of Round-
abouts (Steam).
Only yesterday I heard him say to a
member of the public who came in just
as we were going home: “I’m sorry, sir,
but it is after office hours.”
He had that finality, that touch of
authority, in his voice which hinted that
some day he might really be one of us.

another finishes suddenly in the middle
of a broken bridge. Most of the others
are just dead-ends ; still, the chief reckons
one of ’em’s O.K. Let’s hope we’re on
that. Anyhow, anything’s better than
standing still. We must let the passengers
see we’re making an effort. They’re
paying.”

“ ‘To travel hope-
fully is better

“You can tell the world that the
train will get through. My experts have
thoroughly mapped out its course, which
is being revised hourly to suit changing
conditions. Slight deviations from the
schedule have been found necessary, and
further alterations may occur at any
minute ; but that train will not turn back.
It will keep on and on. Somewhere, on
one of those lines ahead of it, lies Pros-

there, even if there’s nothing left

The idea might spread. The cotton
manufacturers of Calicut would be in
favor of it; likewise the crockery-makers
of China, the munition manufacturers
of Bayonne, the poultry-farmers of Mos-
cow, Leghorn and Turkey, the currant-
growers of Corinth, the livestock-
breeders of Angora and Jersey and the
manufacturers of knitted garments in
Jersey and Guernsey. Bird-fanciers in
the Canary Islands would doubtless join
in, and the Spanish onion-growers might
well complain. But the movement would
not be really successful unless it secured
a revival of catapult-making in Shanghai.

NOTHING TO LAUGH AT.
Talkies of the slapstick-comedy variety
delight me immensely. The antics of fat
men in particular I always enjoy. My
wife is often ashamed of my too voluble
appreciation of Oliver Hardy. Yet the
other day, during a comic picture, despite
the fact that it was excellent entertain-
ment, I could not raise a smile. I was,
in fact, decidedly bad-tempered, and I
felt worse every time I looked at the fat
man who was apparently suffering
from St. Vitus’s dance, though to any-
one else he may have appeared quite
funny.
It was just my bad luck to pick the
only vacant seat in the row right behind
him.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The autumn meetings in Melbourne
ended without definitely establishing the
superiority of any horse, young or old.
Sir John landed the Sires’ Produce Stakes
for Ned Moss, beating Pasha (winner of
the Maribyrnong Plate last spring) by
lengths; but Pasha whipped in the
field when Arachne romped home
in the Ascot Vale Stakes. It would
seem that Arachne is the best juve-
nile of her year, though bought as a
youngster for 75gns. The daughter of
Corban might have captured the Futurity
Stakes if Jack Donohoe had not been
compelled to give her a let-up after scor-
ing at Williamstown on February 10.
Arachne was kicked on one of her shins
while at the post on that occasion. She
made a good recovery, and was backed
down to 5 to 4 on for the Ascot Vale
Stakes, which cost her no real effort to
win. Corban, the sire of Arachne, is by
The Tetrarch. She inherits speed on
both sides of her pedigree, the dam being
Welkin Queen.
On the middle day of the Flemington
meeting Hall Mark vanquished Limarch,
who had dfead-heated with him in the St.
Leger. Their second encounter occurred
in the King’s Plate of 1| miles at weight-
for-age. Pike cannot ride at Bst. 21b., so
the mount on Kellow’s colt went to
Bej?t : Voure VERV CHANGEABLE.

Dempsey. Within a few strides of the
post Dempsey dropped his hands and
Hall Mark beat J. T. Jamieson’s candi-
date by a neck only. “He won nicely,”
Dempsey stated after the race. Kellow
shared in the elation of his trainer, Holt,
and Hall Mark is going to Sydney to
compete in the St. Leger and King’s
Cup ; he has been withdrawn from the
Sydney Cup. The Heroic colt is not so
fit as he was in the spring, and it will be
futile for him to challenge Chatham at
weight-for-age over a short journey or
take on Rogilla in the long-distance events
on that basis.
• •
Pike had an unpleasant trip to Mel-
bourne. Punters blamed him for Hall
Mark being beaten by Danilo in the St.
George Stakes at Caulfield, and when the
St. Leger dead-heat took place they made
an angry demonstration against the Syd-
ney jockey. After that every opportunity
was seized to make Pike uncomfortable.
Farndale cannoned into Curator at the
start of the Ascot Vale Stakes, and Pike,
who rode Curator, was unseated—his
second fall of that kind at the carnival,
Instead of feeling sympathy, a section of
the spectators commented bitingly on the
quality of his horsemanship. Such con-
duct by a racecourse crowd cannot be
defended. Pike has no superior in Aus-
tralia as a flatrace jockey, and before
the autumn ends it will be realised that
he was made to bear the burden of Hall
Mark’s backward form.

the C. M Lloyd Stakes looked the best
of good things for Closing Time, yet
Jacko went out as good a favorite. When
he won the Villiers Stakes in Pecember
Closing Time ran the mile in Imin.
35|sec., thus equalling Winooka’s Aus-
tralian record for the distance. On Satur-
day the Tippler stallion met Jacko on
101 b. better terms than in the Newmarket
Handicap. Why did big punters throw
reasoh to the winds and plunge on Jacko?
It was a one-horse race ; Closing Time
led from start to finish. As usual, Jacko
was slow to find his legs. He put forth
a splendid effort in the straight, but could
not get within striking distance of Clos-
ing Time, who won, easing up, by 2\
lengths, the heavily-backed Kuvera being
only a moderate third. J. T. Jamieson,
who owns Closing Time, also landed the
Farewell Handicap with High Degree, a
four-year-old gelding by Heroic. As
much as 20 to 1 was obtained about
High Degree. He firmed to 14 to 1, and
the stable made a nice haul.
There was no fluke about the vic-
tory of Heroic Prince in the Australian
Cup. If the race could have been re-
run he would have gone out a hot
favorite. Gippsland, because of his splen-
did win in the Brunswick Stakes on the
previous Saturday, was backed from 5 to
1 down to 3 to 1 on the course. Sea
Rover came next in request at 5 to 1,
while Heroic Prince —first favorite a day
or two before the race—eased to 8
to 1. Gippsland is merely a plug. He
can stay for ever, but, even over a jour-
ney of 2} miles, began to show his best
pace at too late a stage. Half-way down
the straight, Gippsland hung in under
punishment, and Skidmore ceased riding
momentarily in order to avoid colliding
with another horse. Gippsland finished
gamely to deprive Distant of third honors.
Heroic Prince cut down Peter Jackson
inside the two-furlong post and defeated
him very brilliantly by 2\ lengths.
C. B. Kellow must regret having sold
Heroic Prince, whose staying ability was
unsuspected when H. Leek acquired the
chestnut at auction in the spring of 1932
for 500 guineas. Leek always believed
that the gelding would prove himself
over a distance, and was fortified in that
opinion by the dam tracing back to
Crossfire, who was a sister to Arsenal
(Melbourne Cup, 1886) and produced
Alawa. Two seasons ago Leek tried to
win a Sydney Cup with Mira Donna, but
failed. His father, the late John Leek,
appropriated the Caulfield Cup of 1900
with Ingliston.
Rapsonia, in receipt of 191 b., downed
the Newmarket Handicap winner, Four-
some, in the Leonard Stakes, and ran
“six” in Imin. llfsec. Two days before,
carrying Bst. 51b., he got away with the
Bourke Handicap, seven furlongs, in
Imin. 24|sec. ; Skidmore rode him on
both occasions. On that form the son of
Curialis—Steel Wings looked like taking
no end of beating in the Doncaster with
7st. 121 b., but he has gone up to Bst. 51b.
* * * *
After many failures, Silver Scorn
showed her real form in the Westmead
Handicap at Rosehill on Saturday by
making hacks of Gloriole and Question-
naire. She was backed from fours to
6 to 4, and the result was not in doubt
from the turn ; she cleared away in the
straight, and won, pulling up, by three
lengths in Imin. 12|sec.—half a second
outside the track record for “six.” The
opening favorite, Leila Vale, eased to twos
when the money came for Silver Scorn.
Turbine was kicked at the post, and took
no part in the race, although he was
declared a starter, having being called
j nto fi ne j£e was f a j r j y we p backed at
sevens. His backers had reason to com-
p]ain, and the rule should be altered,

Trainer Booth regrets not having Tin-
galba in the Doncaster and Sydney Cup.
Backed from 9 to 4 to 6 to 4, he was
taken to the front nine furlongs from
home in the Club Handicap, and the rest
was a procession. Royal Tune was sec-
ond, and may have been closer had his
apprentice rider not been loaded with in-
structions. Satmoth, looking rather on
the big side, was third. Sassanides was
not suited by the slow pace in the early
stages ; nevertheless he was lucky to beat
Tingalba for second prize at Randwick
the previous week.
Ramadan, carrying Hugh Denison’s
colors, won the Rydalmere Mile in good
style fr° m R amr °d and Fleet. Early
backers got tens, but he closed at sixes,
This Rampion three-year-old colt has
7st. 21b. in the Doncaster, and, judging
by his smart run in the straight, looks
to be one of the picks of the lightweights,
The much-boomed Camargo was a hot
favorite. Webb took her to the front
from barrier-rise, but she was well beaten
at the Leger.

Tom Hannan brought joy to the
bookies when Winawin (20 to 1) an-
nexed the Granville Novice from Depar
and Rogavis. Winawin is held on lease
from pastoral* J. J Leahy. He stays
fairly well, and should pick up a subur-
ban handicap or one of the long races at
the mid-week fixtures. He is a brother
to Pentheus.

Randwick trainer W. Kelso has a
small filly named Misnomer, by Rossen-
dale from Lady Stewart, by Bezoman
from Sister Francis, by Seaton Delaval.
She Walked in at Menan S le Park > and

first-division of the Rosehill Juvenile at
sevens. She led all the way, and equalled
the track record for 4| furlongs. Ros-
sinver and Robber filled the places.
Marcana, a stable-mate of Ramadan, also
owned by Hugh Denison, completed a
double for that knight; she took the
second division, at sixes, from Faraday
and Blinking. Marcana’s dam, Mary
Betty, is related to Just Gold, who won
races for Canterbury trainer O. H. Hall,
The favorite, Wakoola, came from New-
castle well accredited, but he showed up
for a couple of furlongs only.
Two good track gallopers, Musician
and Old Master, won their respective
heats of the Maiden Welter. In the first
Musician (7 to 1) should have been fav-
orite, as he had run second in open
company, and was tipped by The Bulle-
tin on that performance. The second
division broke a run of bad luck for
trainer Dan Lewis. Old Master (7 to 4)
finished gamely to beat Happy Gift and
Rogarma. He is owned by E. J. Watt.
* * * *
As a youngster, Windbag was rejected
by more than one trainer because he
looked so mean, and when his racing
days were done he was neglected because
Australian sires were unfashionable.
Thus he passed into the hands of A. G.
Hunter, of Northwood Park, Seymour,
Victoria, who counts the day on which
the 1925 Melbourne Cup winner stepped
on his property as the most fortunate of
his life as a sportsman. Liberal, a son
of Windbag, won the Guineas and Derby
for him, and would have gone on to
greater victories but for the accident
which cut short his career. Now buyers
of yearlings go to Northwood Park as
long ago they went to St. Albans. Hunter
sent 13 Windbag yearlings into the sale
ring last week; they realised 5670
guineas, averaging a shade over 436. For
a bay colt by Windbag—Lutra, S. Masters
paid 1100 guineas. Another bay colt by
Windbag—Even Song was knocked down
to Frank Musgrave for 1000 guineas.
These are the best prices realised for a
batch of yearlings since the slump began.
“D.E.”: Years ago Perth had two
courses given over to pony-racing. Alick
Clydesdale, who controlled them for
Wren, negotiated an agreement by virtue
of which his track came under W.A.T.C.
jurisdiction; and pony-racing entered
upon its last phase. For a time Clydes-
dale put on handicaps for the ponies, but
these became rare, and in time the ponies
ceased to be seen on his courses or any
other in the neighborhood. History is
repeating itself in Sydney, and for much
the same reason. Ascot, Rosebery, Vic-
toria Park and Kensington, the pony
clubs “whitewashed” by the A.J.C a year
or two ago, still cater spasmodically for
the 14.2 class but the smaller animals
rarely get a look-in; and pony-racing,
once so prosperous, is obviously doomed.
An aggrieved deputation of breeders,
owners and trainers of ponies saw the
Chief Secretary about it the other day,
but he can do nothing,

Shop betting has now taken its place
as one of the established industries of
S.A. The Betting Control Board com-
mands greater reverence than the Gov-
ernment. At the beginning of the month
i t had issued 187 licenses, of which 119
wer e for shops in the former Holy City
and its suburbs ; and the regulations it
is putting forth threaten to rival those
of the Taxation Department. Book-
makers are not to bet with minors or
drunks. They may not accept wagers of
less than Is., but must lay the odds to
£l. There are numerous starting-price
limits: 33 to 1 where stake-money is
£lOOO or over ; 20 to 1 on other races at
Adelaide courses and at Caulfield and
Flemington ; 15 to 1 on races at other
Melbourne courses and Sydney courses;
12 to 1 on S.A. country races and 10
to 1 on Vic. and N.S.W. country races,
Possibly some day half the South Aus-
tralians will get their living by betting
with the other half.
M O. (and Rafferty) Rules
Wesley Ramey, who has a decision
over Tony Canzonieri, champion of the
U.S.A., outpointed Jimmy Kelso, the
Australian crack, in their match at Syd-
ney Stadium last week, but Kelso was
never once off his feet. This lad is
something of a boxing curiosity. His
record shows that he has been five times
knocked out—Al Burke, Rus Critcher and
Bobby Delaney did the trick in 1929 —
and it used to be thought that a pug was
never the same after one knockout. Yet
Kelso is not only a much better fighter
to-day than he was three or four years
ago, but the punchers he meets don’t
seem capable of battering him to the
floor, let alone putting him down for the
count. His showing against Ramey sug-
gested that he needs a spell; but he
probably won’t get it, being the Stadium’s
greatest draw.
* * * *
No more than a middleweight in
appearance, Martin Bucht was beaten by
Bill Beth at Leichhardt. A back-
slam put him out of commission in the
fifth round. A novelty was introduced at
Newtown, where Walter Browning and
Penchiff wrestled six rounds without
either scoring a fall. They didn’t even
punch the referee.
Ins and' Outs
It is now suspected that C. L. Bad-
cock is a better batsman than one or two
of those who are going to England. The
youngster scored a chanceless 105 against
the tourists in their first match together.
O’Reilly and Ebeling did not play and,
with the exception of Fleetwood-Smith
(5 for 108), the bowlers seemed harm-
less. Tasmania, batting at Launceston,
made 345 (Ferrall 47 and Morrisby 44);
Australia had 42 up without loss at lunch
on Monday. Badcock has now scored
1671 runs for the season. He has passed
the thousand mark in each of the last
four seasons and he’s not 21 yet.

A redesigned combustion chamber,
with new placement for valves and
spark plug, revolutionises the per-
formance of this new Truck engine.
In every respect, by every standard of
comparison, you will find that the features
of the new British Chevrolet Truck stamp
it as the unbeatable value for 1934. Here
are some of the modern improvements . .
ENGINE : The valve-in-head type engine has
many new refinements which give it more power,
speed, and smoothness and at the same time
effecting an increase in petrol economy.
CHASSIS : Both the 131 in. and 157 in. wheel-
base models have entirely new frames strengthened
with the new “Alligator-jaw” type cross members.
The front springs now have a threaded shackle at
the forward end which reduces wear and side-sway
to a minimum.
BODY : The 1934 Chevrolets are available in
two capacities : 30 cwt. in 131 in. wheelbase and
2 ton in both 131 in. and 157 in. wheelbases. Bodies
available include —Platform and Coaming, Drop
Sides, Tipper, and a new Semi-Trailer model.
Without doubt the cab of the new British Chev-
rolet is the finest on any truck regardless of price.
It is roomy and has every fitting for driver
comfort, including genuine leather upholstery.

ins and Outs
At Carlton’s valedictory to Woodfull,
the wild and whirling Kelly, of the Board
of Control, let himself go in this fashion:
If cricket is played in 1934 as it was
played by Englishmen in the time of the
Spofforths and Trumbles, Australia will
regain the ashes; but if cricket, or alleged
cricket, is played under the captaincy of a
man by the name of Jardine, I will strike
that out.
Perhaps these words reached Jardine in
some Indian jungle and made him
tremble. Anyway, he has sent word to
say that he won’t be playing for the
county regularly this year, and if he is
not available for his county he is un-
likely to lead England. He is to be
succeeded as captain of Surrey by E. R.
T. Holmes, and it seems likely that
Wyatt will take his place as skipper of
England.
* * * *
Australians learned with regret that
“Gubby” Allen had had to undergo an
operation—a consequence, it is thought,
of a blow sustained while the amiable
youth was playing deck tennis aboard the
steamer that took Jardine’s men from
Sydney to Wellington. The operation
was successful, but Allen is unlikely to
be able to play for his adopted country
till late in the season, if at all. He will
be a severe loss to the English Eleven,
for he has developed into an uncom-
monly useful all-rounder, and he has
never incurred the suspicion that he
bowled at the man.
* V * *
Grimmett and Wall had a day out at
the expense of the touring Westralians
during their return match against South
Aus. In the first innings Grimmett took
7-57, the visitors being all out for 140.
Wall had his turn when the Westerners
followed on, taking the first three wickets
for eight off six overs. Hill-Smith, who
finally went to Grimmett, top-scored with
30. Match drawn ; 287 to 140 and 5-93.
* * * *
“Kathor”: Frank Bryant is the first
Westralian to have scored two centuries
against Victoria. His first was six
years ago in Perth, when he made
113 not out; his second at Mel-
bourne on the tour just completed.
Hill-Smith’s recent 93 is the highest
ever for W.A. against the Ma State.
* * * *
“Nasalia”: Playing for Southern
Districts against Upper North in
Adelaide, O’Sullivan took the hat-
trick. Two victims were caught
behind and the third was stumped.
The ’keeper’s name is Grosvenor,
but he was called “Duckworth”
after that.
“Bumpk”: One of the prettiest dis-
plays of hard hitting for a long time was
that of R. Friend, batting for Camber-
well (Vic.) in the senior competition of
the 1.0. R. Association. Of his side’s
score of 146 he made 100 in 83 minutes,
smiting nine fours and five sixers. Then
he retired and rushed off to a wedding.
The Nineteenth Hole
“D.”: : Country clubs after the U.S.A.
model are springing up in all directions.
The latest is the Glenmore, near Pen-
rith (N.S.W.). It has started with the
advantage of a lovely clubhouse ; one of
those old places which were standing
when Lawson built his home in the
direction of Parramatta. , George Capel,
who is well and favorably known in the
Sydney and near-Sydney clubs, is the first
captain. He won the first stroke com-
petition with a 73 —78 minus 5.
* * * *
The N.S.W. team to defend the Kirk-
Windeyer Cup in Maoriland next month
consists of Eric Apperly (captain), W. R.
Dobson —who has had a lean time lately
—Cutler, Ruwald and Hughes. Ferrier
was unavailable and Withycombe was
passed over. A palpable blunder.
* * * *
“H.S.”: The mutterings of astonish-
ment over the non-selection of R. J.
Withycombe for the Kirk-Windeyer jaunt
had hardly died down when he put up
a performance which suggests that he
has few equals in N. S. Wales at the
moment. Playing at Kensington in a club
secretaries’ competition he equalled par
(70) with 35 each way. No one has
beaten this effort. In the afternoon he
went round in 72 and was unlucky not
to do better. He excels with his irons,
but he is a marvel in every department
of the game on his day.
* * * *
“L’Oiseau”: Three years ago a band
of enthusiasts braved the scorn of the
unemployed miners, decorated the stone-
and goat-covered hills of Mt. Morgan
(Q.) with plus-fours, and laid down a
very sporting, though rough, nine-hole
golf course. Mt. Morgan members scoff
at all authorities who stress the import-
ance of the left arm, for the local cham-
pion is a right-handed player whose left
arm is crippled. No ; it isn’t a case of
being the best of a mob of mugs. He
has played on other courses and lived
up to his local reputation.
* * * *
“Ex-Guardee”: Sydney “Sun,” which
is working itself up to such a condi-
tion of loyal fever on the subject of
Prince George that it threatens, unless
checked, to become frenzied, announced
last week that the young man was a
“champion golf player.” A recent cable
provided a line on his form: the Prince
of Wales, it seems, gives him half a
stroke. The Prince’s handicap is known
to fluctuate round 16 ; so you can work
out Prince George’s allotment for your-
self. In point of fact, no member of
the royal family is much good at any
form of sport, though they are all triers.
“What iron should I use now?”
“Try a grapplin’ iron.”
The Duke of York is the exception ; he
is a fairly sound horseman.
Racquet and Bawl
Hitherto no Australian girl has really
distinguished herself at Wimbledon,
although Brookes, Crawford and Patter-
son have won the highest honors there.
Joan Hartigan has excellent prospects
this year, for with the decline of Helen
Wills international form is not particu-
larly good ; then Miss Hartigan ranks
higher than any Australian who has ever
played on the centre court. Strongly
built, she is fast on her feet, has no
weak stroke and is learning all the time.
Again, naming no names, she is a good
deal younger than the best of the players
she will have to meet. Miss Hartigan is
a pupil of the veteran Edwards, who
has taught so many scores of good
players. Years ago, the pundits of the
N.S.W.L.T.A. fell out with Edwards and
gravely informed Miss Hartigan that if
she persisted in playing in a tournament
arranged by her teacher she would lose
her amateur status. She played all the
same, and although the threat that she
would be consigned to the outer dark-
ness of professionalism was held over
her for weeks the pundits eventually
thought better of it. Some of the old
gentlemen shudder when they think of it
now ; had they remained stubborn they
would have deprived their association of
one of its principal gate-money attrac-
tions.
* * * *
“Bournemouth”: That reference to the
abolition of the second service (B. 7 / 2 / ’34)
reminds me that the rules of tennis
might be overhauled in other respects.
The footfault rule in particular is the
cause of endless trouble between umpires
and players and is difficult to adhere to
strictly on the player’s part. The return
to the old usage wherein it was only in-
sisted that one foot should be on the
ground behind the line at the moment of
serving would be welcomed by all hands
and the cook, and would not affect the
conduct of the game in the slightest.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: That Japanese
storm-troop formation to capture the
Davis Cup (B. 21/2/’34) has already
started to come unglued. Nunoi
announces that he will be unable to make
the trip to Europe, because his mother
forbids it. Feminine influence in this
regard seems to be spreading. The
American team with us last year made
such a fuss at having to leave their
spouses behind that the Yankee authori-
ties promptly agreed to pay the cost of
transporting the ladies. In Australia we
have a case in point with Crawford. That
young man won’t go abroad without
Mrs. C., and the Australian L.T.A. has
to find the money for both. It only needs
our cricketers’ wives to issue an ulti-
matum of the same sort and the fat will
be in the fire with a vengeance.
Car and Cycle
“Wooden Rim”: British motor-manu-
facturers are experimenting with a new
system of valve cooling which, it is
claimed, will allow for an increase in
engine compression and power output.
Hollow valves are used and are kept cool
by the circulation inside of a stream of
oil. The oil is pumped down small pipes
inside the valve-stems and returns to
sump between the pipes and the wall of
the stems. The rise in temperature is not
more than three degrees, and bench tests
have been satisfactory.
* * * *
“Glenelg”: South Australia’s motor-
cycle heads have announced that they
will run a “Three States” trial at a date
to be shortly fixed. The route will be
from Adelaide through Mildura to
Sydney, and then to the finish at Mel-
bourne. Some 50 riders are already
reckoned on from Victoria, Ma and
South Australia. Queenslanders are be-
ing urged to give it a go, but the high cost
of getting down to Adelaide for a start
is likely to keep most of the Bananaland
fliers out of the show.
* * * *
“R. Volt”: A novelty exhibited in Mel-
bourne’s Town Hall at the Motor-cycle
Show is a wireless-set fitted to one of the
spidery vehicles. It is housed in the
sidecar along with the girl friend. The
next innovation will be pushbikes fitted
with superhets.
* * * *
“Kelutti”: Vic. Auto-Cycle Union is
sounding riders to see how many are will -
ing to go to England for the Isle of Man
races. The guarantee has been cut down
to £25. Of the Victorians, George Hanna-
ford is said to be willing, but the lack of
enthusiasm in other quarters is pro-
nounced.
Miscellaneous
“Datop”: A Tallangatta (Vic.) rifle-
man, R. T. Hempel, put up a splendid
performance at the Williamstown range
last week to take the David Syme grand
aggregate. Using a Lilhgow-made rifle,
he scored the possible 50 at each of the
three long ranges —700, 800 and 900
yards. The previous day he had dropped
eight points out of his 30 shots over the
short ranges, so that his score read 292
points out of 300 possible, a record for
the Syme aggregate. Second place went
to F. S. Nelson, a Ma-Stater, 289.
Hempel has been a consistent marksman
in club shoots, and filled 12th place in
the 1929 King’s.
Scoring the possible over each of the
last two ranges, H. S. Johnston, of
Wangaratta (Vic.), took the King’s Prize
with an aggregate of 341. Second place
went to C. Williams, of Melbourne, 340.
* * * *
“Kathor”: Victorian sprinter Howard
Yates —he’s only 20—is doing his best
to make the team for the Empire Games.
Twice in the last three weeks he’s been
clocked over 220 yards in 21 3-ssec„
which equals Jimmy Carlton’s Austra-
lian record for the distance, and early in
the season he did 9 7-10 sec. for the 100.
It looks as though Metcalfe, Golding,
Victorian Woodhouse and Yates are a
likely combination, with Jack Horsfall
already getting his eye in in the Cold
Country.
* * * *
“Nor-Nor”: Professional sprinter Aus-
tin Robertson is considering an invitation
from an English syndicate to run- there
in a proposed world’s championship:
distance, 100 yards; date, May 22.
Robertson is dubious ; he lost more than
he could afford on his American trip last
year, when he was unable to get a race.
Then he 'prefers a longer distance, 120 or
130 yards, and he won’t have much time
to strike form if he does go. The Vic.
centenary heads want him to stay.
* * * *
“Mphm”: That Victorian gentleman
recently mentioned who won a tennis
tourney and a woodchop in the one after-
noon was a mere dilettante compared with
another Cabbage Gardener, J. Armstrong,
who is iron quoit champion of his State.
While playing a billiard match of 250 up,
Armstrong simultaneously played eight
games of draughts and one of chess. He
won the billiards, and took four games of
draughts, drawing three and losing one
of the others, while he also drew in the
chess. Finally he took on J. Boyles, Aus-
tralia’s champion draught-player, blind-
folded, and drew with him.

Henry ford says:
"We use transverse springs in Ford Cars for the same
reason that we use round wheels because we have
found nothing better for the purpose ....
“Most people think that the only purpose of a spring is
comfortable riding. But springs, and even very flexible springs, can
cause discomfort as well as danger. A good spring must not only be
comfortable —it must be safe. It must also assist operation economy.
The spring we use serves all three purposes.
“A transverse spring—which simply means a spring set
crosswise—gives comfort. Road shocks are absorbed at the outer
flexible end. It is like the wings of a bird—the tips move most, while
the body remains steady. I cannot prove that in a letter, but you can prove
it in a Ford V-8. Any dealer will gladly allow you the opportunity.”
FACTS ABOUT THE FORD SPRINGING SYSTEM
With one front wheel raised 9" above the
ground, the body of the car remains per-
fectly level. Similarly when a Ford car encounters
a severe depression or rise in the road surface it
still rides with cushioned smoothness.
2 As the heavy or middle section of the spring
is attached to the frame cross-member while
the flexible or outer end is attached to the axle
close to the wheel, each Ford spring serves as two
separate springs working independently. Con-
sequently, one half of each spring absorbs the road
shocks on its side and end of the car without
affecting the entire frame or body.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STRFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
TOO MANY BREEDS.
“W.D.Mc.”: “Golightly” on “Wool
and Fats” (B. 7/2/’34) reckons I slated
the Dorset Horn, and “Anti-Dorset” says
I did not go far enough. I am surprised
at my own moderation. I once owned
an Angora billy who was 100 p.c. pro-
lific, but I never claimed that as a virtue
for him, although his mohair was worth
more than any»D.H. ever cut.
If “Golightly” wants a decent sheep
let him try the Ryeland, which has
come to stay and in a few years will be
one of the most popular of the British
breeds. My father, a station manager in
the early days, used to say that Australia
needed only two breeds, the merino and
the Lincoln, and that between the two
you could breed any type of woolly. The
success of the Corriedale in recent years
goes to prove that he was right—too
many breeds only lead to mongrels.
“Nord”: “Anti-Dorset” (B. 24/1/’34),
before condemning the Dorset Horn as
being a rogue, might reflect on these un-
deniable facts. Character, as in the
human race, is based in sheep on heredity
and environment. The especial trait of
character that the Dorset is a fine jumper
might well be attributed to environment.
“What is made of the lamb will remain
in the sheep.”
Too often do we see ewes grazing on
one side of the fence and the lambs
fossicking around upon the other side,
due to slack fence wires, improper spac-
ing of wires and so forth.
“Anti-D.” will find his remarks about
fence-negotiation applicable to all sheep
other than most merinos. If he manages
his Dorsets on the basis of training a
lamb in the way it should go, he will find
when it is old it will not depart from
him unless his fences are unusually weak.
THE CORRIEDALE SUCCEEDS.
“Sheepo”: Fat-lamb producers and
grazing farmers might go in for Corrie-
dales instead of experimenting with more
doubtful breeds.
Corriedale hardiness, coupled with the
undoubted value of the breed’s wool, as
well as its mutton worth, has placed this
Australian breed on a high plane.
Rightly treated, suckers will reach ex-
port weight (30 to 361 b.) and quality at
from four to four and a half months.
Two consignments of fat lambs killed by
Borthwicks for the same owner, Corrie-
dales and another long-wool breed,
showed that the former graded better
than the latter, with the dressed weights
almost the same. The Corriedale lambs
graded 79 per cent, firsts and 21 per cent,
seconds, with no rejects ; the other breed
graded 49 per cent, firsts, 45 per cent,
seconds, 6 per cent, thirds and rejects.
With no ban on the export of Corrie-
dales as with merinos, Japan, S. America
and Africa are buying large numbers of
ewes and rams, the high-yielding comb-
ing wool being the attraction.
A condition of acceptance of stud-
breeders into the Australasian Corriedale
Society is that all flocks must have proved
evidence of the origin being 50 per cent,
of both Lincoln and merino, with the
subsequent rigid adherence to this stand-
ard. All registered Corriedales are tat-
tdoed in the ear with the letter C.
Buyers should look for this before pur-
chasing.
WORKING SHEEP.
“E.J.D.”: All the dreadfuL noises made
with tins strung on wire, the yelling of
men, the barking of dogs and the cruel
prodding of sheep with poles can be
avoided.
Try this: Go to the head of the draft-
ing race, stand close to the fence, hold
the hand out and wave it slowly towards
the rear of the sheep. Move slowly in
the same direction, then return to the
head of the race. The sheep will follow.
In the yards, don’t approach the sheep
from the rear ; come towards them from
where you want them to go. They imme-
diately rush in that direction. Your dog,
or man, can then hold them in the rear,
whilst you proceed to the front of the
mob. If they are close to the mouth of
the race, work in the manner first de-
scribed. Go slow, keep returning to the
front, or where you want them to go.
Sheep always try to get behind you, and
they will scurry from under the waving
extended arm.
I have penned up for 30 fast-moving
shearers, and was never caught short. I
used no sticks, had no dogs or assist-
ance, filled sweating pens, and that some-
times from the big yard, and found the
job easy money.
There will be lots of little stops in the
easy flow of sheep, but be patient. If
you have to carry a sheep in as a coaxer
to the mob, lay it down on its side, and
it will stay that way all day if you
cover its eyes with your hat.
KILLING FARM MUTTON.
“T.E.L.”: Have sheep in the yard at
least three hours before slaughtering-time.
Rested sheep mean tender mutton. To
add to that tenderness do not, when
actually killing, cut the throat and sever
the spinal column and cord at the same
time; allow the animals to bleed well
before slitting the marrow.
Sharp knives are essential for good
workmanship.
Two are desirable —a thrusting and a
siding knife.
Keep the oilstone (never use a file)
handy and your killing gear clean. In
severing the knee from the shank do not
cut and break. To make a neater job,
locate the lower joint, near the shank
end, and slit cleanly through with a knife.
Peeling the entire shank is purely for
show purposes and a waste of time on
the farm.
Do not “punch” the sheep while on
the ground or the killing-board. By so
doing you are liable to tear the epider-
mis skin. Apart from appearances, an
unbroken epidermis skin assists in the
carcass setting firm.
Pull the brisket skin back a little way
and punch the skin off a few inches fur-
ther with the handle of your knife. Then
when the animal is strung up and the
skin opened down to the brisket and
parted from the carcass (with the knife),
at the thick flank and at the elbows, you
should be able to punch off the rest of
the adhering hide without further use of
your knife. If the hide is inclined to be
tough at the rump, the knife-handle may
be resorted to.
Before opening up, cut open the bris-
ket (a job that necessitates care), for by
so doing you eliminate the risk of rip-
ping the paunch, etc., and, after collect-
ing the caul-fat, allow the offal to fall
through in one clean piece.
Immediately after hanging sponge the
carcass over with a clean cloth dipped in
cold water and wash out the inner sur-
faces. A pine stick spreading the flaps
aids the air to circulate freely about the
meat, sweetens it and assists in the
setting.
When cutting down, always take out
the lymphatic glands in the point of the
shoulder and in the thick flank portion
of the leg. It will be noticed that it is at
these points putrefaction first sets in.
“Mustard cancer” developing in these
glands often passes unnoticed till the
joint of mutton is on the table.
HIDES FOR STATION GEAR.
“N.S.”: Fold the hide or skin when
fresh neatly into as small a bundle as
possible and bury it in sand or hot stable
manure until the hair comes off easily
with the fingers. Then spread it out
on an even surface and scrape all the
hair off. Peg out under cover, and while
drying brush in one quart of strong
vinegar at intervals. For a kangaroo-
skin use one pint of vinegar. The hide
is all the better if allowed to hang for
three months before using. Hot weather
is the best time to bury in sand, when
it does not need more than 48 hours
to loosen the hair. The above recipe is good
for all general-purpose hides, especially
those used for lacing or sewing any kind
of harness. Traces made out of hide
so cured are strong and durable, and
wear better than the ordinary tanned
leather.
RAPE FOR TOPPING OFF.
“Mixed Farmer”: The average small
holder finds a shortage of green feed
during the late autumn, winter and early
spring, and consequently his market sheep
lose condition. I have found that about
51b. of rape with a half-pound of mus-
tard per acre, sown even on mediocre
land, will give green grazing that will
top off all classes of sheep.
It is best to give the sheep, say, only
half a day on the cultivation, preferably
from midday onward when the dew is
off, and thus fed—with the corrective
value of the mustard —there will be no
signs of scouring.
As soon as the sheep are fat truck them
without delay, as their condition will be
lost even in a week off the rape. It is
the ideal agent for fattening gummies
and broken-toothed old sheep, as well as
lambs. With average season, the seed
germinates rapidly when not sown too
deeply, and should be about 6in. high
inside ten weeks.
It can be then grazed lightly, rested
and grazed again in rotation till the first
hot days of spring, when the lot should
be ploughed in, making the culti-
vation ideal for maize or cereal sowing.
Rape is a member of the turnip family,
and becomes aphis-covered with the heat,
but will grow in the coldest of winters,
giving fattening green feed.
MORE LIGHT ON LIMING.
“Hatter”: Probably no single cause is
more seriously limiting production and
nullifying manure results than is soil
acidity. There are extraordinary gaps in
our knowledge of the actual returns
likely to be gained from liming.
The Rothamsted report for 1932 quotes
an experiment carried out on a light soil
of an acid nature.
Crop, Sugar Beet.
Chalk, tons per
acre .. .. Nil. 1. 2. 3. 4.
Roots, tons per
acre .. .. 1.82 12.61 14.30 14.37 14.74
Sugar, per cent. 18.74 18.72 18.84 18.65 18.79
Tops, tons per
acre 1.44 11.79 12.01 13.50 13.32
In this test a moderate dressing of one
ton of chalk raised the yield from under
two tons per acre to tons.
Wherever the failure of the sensitive
crops, like lucerne, red clover, carrots,
sugar beet, mangolds, barley and mus-
tard, suggests lime deficiency, soil-acidity
tests should be made.
Potatoes will stand a certain amount
of acidity, and tomatoes, an allied plant,
do not usually respond either to lime or
super. Dressings of either may even
depress the crop. On the other hand,
peas and beans give poor results when
acidity is present, and cabbages and tur-
nips suffer from “club-root” or ‘'finger-
and-toe” diseases.
Dr. T. Wallace, in the British R.A.S.
Journal, states that
no critical experiment in England has ever
shown that liming is beneficial to fruits, though,
on the other hand, many cases are known where
calcareous soils are unsuitable for fruit-growing
owing to the development of lime-induced
chlorosis.
He adds that various fruits are seen to
thrive on slightly acid soils, and, where
poor results have been obtained, liming
has had negative results, whereas favor-
able potash fertilisers have been a suc-
cess.
SOWING LUCERNE.
“Lion”: Having sown hundreds of
acres of lucerne, I have found this the
best and surest method:
(1) Use a combine, adjusted so that the front
tynes cultivate the soil only about an inch
deep, but with the back rows of tynes out ot
the ground. Drag the usual light harrows
behind as for other sowing. Remove all tubes
from machine.
(2) Mix the seed thoroughly with at least
601 b. of super, per acre. For cutting purposes,
81b. to 101 b. of seed is ample, giving a thick
stand on all rich soil paddocks where under-
ground water is available.
(3) Do not put into the manure box more
than enough for an acre at a time. Watch
continually to keep manure and seed mixed.
(4) Mix as you require it. It is best to have
one man sowing and one weighing and mix-
ing. It is quicker and safer, for the mixer
has ample time to mix properly. The evenness
of your stand depends largely on the mixer, pre-
suming seed to be of uniform quality.
(5) Only sow the very best and cleanest
seed. Make sure it is free of such pests as
dodder and dock. Rich golden-yellow fat
grain is the strongest in germination. The
best pays. Sow locally grown seed, if possible.
(6) The seed can be sown in March or late
in August. I prefer the latter in districts hav-
ing heavy winter frosts. It does not pay to
sow a cover crop, unless you are sowing graz-
ing lucerne.
(7) For grazing lucerne, use similar methods.
From 21b. to 41b. of seed is ample. The poorer
the soil the less seed is used, remember —301 b.
of oats or 451 b. of wheat per acre is enough for
the cover crop. It is wise to use more super,
with a cover crop—what you can afford up to
lcwt. per acre.
I have tried broadcasting with fiddle
machines and “harrowing” in with light
boughs drawn behind a horse, but they
are not so good as the combine. Re-
member, never sow the seed deep —half
an inch should be the maximum.
PUTTING UP NETTING.
“H.C.M.”: “Michael Prior” (B.
14/2/’34) can do his netting in half the
time and faultlessly as follows:
Find the tight edge of the coil, and
unroll along the fence on the ground so
that the coil runs away from the fence.
The distance between the ultimate end
of a coil and the fence should be between
15yds. and 20yds., but no more. Unroll
by hand and not with a crowbar inside
and pulled, in order to let the tight edge
pull the unwinding coil away from the
fence.
Lay the next coil on the end to- stop it
flying back up the line.
Now, tighten the first end to the
strainer. Next, cut a long length of tie-
wire, remove the “twist” in it, and run
one end between belt and waist, leaving
the other to drag along behind you.
Proceed to the first post from strainer,
lift the netting from ground, and force
the tight edge against the wire on the
side of post furthest from strainer with
your knee. Holding it taut with the knee,
slip tie-wire under the edge of netting
and wire, grab with light snips, give two
twists, using hand holding wire and snips,
and tie is made.
Continue down the line of posts in
exactly the same way, until within 30
yards of end of coil. Attach new coil
and proceed as before.
The weight of the netting when forced
up as directed gives the most perfect
strain possible, and this tying system is
quick—approx, two seconds for each tie
for a man in the swing of it.

Bagging Linseed Oil Meal and Sheep Nuts
THE butter and eggs on your breakfast
table, the paint on your garden fence,
the roast lamb for Sunday’s dinner, the
cheerful linoleum on your floors . . . you’d
never think that such far-apart matters as
these could all be vitally affected by the
manufacture of various Linseed products.
They are . . . and that is why we say that the
industry carried on by Meggitt Limited is
woven into the very fabric of Australian
National Life.
Not only does it employ, directly, hundreds of
Australians in the manufacture of Linseed pro-
ducts; it also assists, indirectly, in providing work
for hundreds more in the transport of its goods by
land and sea, and in the many industries with
which it is allied in manufacture.
Australia’s Butter Exports
Meggitt’s Linseed Oil Meal has incalculable in-
fluence upon the quantity and quality of Austalia’s
Dairy Exports—which mean so many millions to
the Commonwealth. Dairy herd production com-
petitions organised by Meggitt’s—covering entries
of as many as 86 herds in one instance and 74
herds in another—have demonstrated, beyond
question, that milk production can be enormously
increased by scientific feeding.
The greatly improved prices of sheep have
brought to the attention of the wool grazier the
importance of scientific feeding, not only as to its
effect upon the fleece, but also for its improve-
ment of the carcass, resulting in better mutton that
will fetch higher prices in the world’s markets. In
the production of Fat Lambs, too, Meggitt’s Lin-
seed Oil Meal makes for a great improvement in
quality . . . and thereby of selling price.
Chilled Beef Possibilities
The attractive possibilities of the Chilled Beef
Market for Australia are just beginning to be
recognised, and very soon suitable shipping
facilities will be available. Rapid development

is to be expected in this industry. To compete with other countries
prime beef of high quality must be produced. Linseed Oil Meal
is recognised, the world over, as the best concentrate for this
purpose. In the countries producing the best beef, scientific feeding,
by the addition of such concentrate, is universally practised.
As the raw material of the great Paint and Varnish industry
of Australia, Meggitt’s Linseed Oil is, of course, acknowledged as
the standard of quality.
A Higher Income for Australia
Meggitt’s products play their part in the improvement of
Australia’s wool and mutton, butter and cheese, poultry and eggs,
resulting in higher prices overseas for Australia’s exports . . . which
means a higher income for the Commonwealth. This increase in
export values will develop more and more as the importance of
linseed concentrates in the feeding of stock becomes more widely
recognised.
Far-reaching though it has been, the educational work that
Meggitt’s have conducted in the interests of the grazier, during
the past few years, has only just begun, if the plans of the Company
are carried out. A year or so ago a special Advisory Department
was established, and inquiries are invited. If you have a feeding
problem, write to Meggitt Limited and place it before them. You
will receive, free of charge, expert advice with detailed ration
instructions.

THE “TRITON”
SATISFIED HIM.
One day a Guest-house Proprietor wrote us:—
“I want a power pump that nobody seems to sell. I want this
pump to be small, and inexpensive to buy and operate. It doesn’t
matter if it only gives three or four hundred gallons per hour, but
it must be absolutely reliable in spite of its smallness and cheapness.
It must not cost me more than £lO. What can you do for me ?”
Frankly, we were stumped for the time being. Among the
wide range of pumps we handled there was nothing quite
suitable in size and price. Then we took a chance. If one
man needed this type of pump, others might also. So our
Works designed and made the sturdy little “TRITON.”
At 300 r.p.m. it gives 360 gallons per hour through 1 in.
piping. It takes only J-h.p. to run it. It is trouble-free, and
practically noiseless. Only 19-J inches high, this powerful
midget completely satisfied our client. Since then the
“TRITON” has become one of our most popular lines.
If you are interested in such a pump, write for particulars.
Its low price will surprise you.

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“Strenuous”: Two strong sticks wired
to the handles to extend them two or
three feet make a single-furrow plough
easy to control in the roughest ground—
and save you a kink in the back.
“Khayyam”: It’s a sound plan to clip
Dobbin’s mane off to a point two or three
inches forward of where the top of his
collar comes. A tangled lump of mane
under the collar is a frequent cause of
sore necks.
“Fluoride”: Try these on your poultry
vermin: For lice, a good dusting of
sodium fluoride, repeated in 10 days;
for sand-fleas, carbolised vaseline rubbed
into the head parts ; for scaly leg, apply
two lots of solignum or carbolineum.
Remember tfi,at chickens which are
mothered by a scaly-legged hen are very
apt to suffer also.
“A.G.R.”: Stable, cow or fowl manure
is effective for bananas when dug in on
the upper side of the stool about two
feet from the plants. All trash and cut
plants (if free from pests and diseases)
should be cut up and dug in, thus in-
creasing the humus content and water-
holding capacity of the soil.
“Pick”: Until the wool has grown a
half-inch or so, skins of sheep slaugh-
tered for rations usually are thrown out
for burning. Squared, sewn together and
covered with canvas they make the best
of cow rugs.
“Agri”: Here is a simple way to make
contour drains. Before fallowing, peg out
the levels and mark them with one round
of the plough, making a “back-up.” Then
plough the paddock in the usual way.
The mark-outs for the drains will still
be discernible. While the soil is still
loose, build up the banks with a few
rounds of the disc cultivator. A Sunder-
cut will make a good job of it. The
Sundercut may be used later on to
repair or strengthen the banks ; but we
have used the disc alone for building the
banks with complete success.
“Artesian”: When compelled to leave
a half-shorn sheep, lay him gently down
and pull enough shorn wool to cover
his eyes. He will wait for you as faith-
fully as a tax-collector with a summons.
“Dimon”: The waste from burning
candles melted down and mixed with a
little tallow will preserve the threads
of bolts dipped in it before storage.
“Werrimee”: To hold small screws,
stick the screw through a strip of thin
cardboard. You can then hold it easily
in position while you give it a turn or
two with the driver.
“Willeroo”: Put a grindstone in a tub
of water for a minute or two before
pouring in the hot lead to hold the
handle. This ensures the stone against
cracking.
“Drayman”: Don’t discard a splitting
axe-handle. Take a lyin. strip of calf-
skin from the skirtings (either fresh or
dry) and soak it well in water. Then
with a broad-headed tack fix it about 2in.
below the split and bind it round the
handle, tightly right up to head without
overlapping. When dry, the hide will
shrink and hold the split firmly in posi-
tion. The handle will then be as strong
as new. The binding, properly put on, is
no inconvenience to the user. In fact,
it may be easier on his hands than the
wood.
“E.H.8.”: For “dry bible” in cattle,
the best remedy that I have found is
a bottle of stout, not beer. Stout con-
tains more gas.
“Louden”: When applying fly-dress-
ing to a struck sheep use a l|in. or a
2in. paint brush of medium stiffness in-
stead of a swab. It is easier to handle,
spreads the dressing more evenly and
economically, and will last a lifetime if
washed carefully after use.
“Strathmore”: To secure a cow’s tail
while milking, take a 2in. x lin. stick,
9in. long, and from half-way taper to
one end down to about %-in. Nail this
to the rail alongside cow, with the wedge
pointing to the rear. Put tail in the
narrow groove, and there will be no more
bother.
“Wayback”: To cure sheepskins for
mats, nail them when fresh on the wall.
Scrape until clean and smooth. Mix one
cupful of coarse salt and one tablespoon-
ful of saltpetre with a cupful of boiling
water. This should do for three dress-
ings. When cool, brush the solution well
over the skins once a day for three days.
Leave the skins tacked out for two weeks
in sun and rain. Take down, wash well
and hang on line to dry.
“D.A.G.”: When a stick makes a hole
in your radiator, chew thoroughly a bit
of newspaper and press the resultant pulp
well into the hole. If the job is well done
you never need to solder. Don’t swallow
your saliva while chewing the paper.
Printer’s ink is not tasty.
“Gundy”: Add about four parts of
baking soda to one of strychnine when
preparing baits for dingoes, foxes or
rabbits. This causes the bait to act
promptly, and the quarry will usually be
found close to the trail.
“E.H.8.”: Try this for cattle suf-
fering from toxic paralysis during the
first stages:
2 tablespoonfuls of rock ground phosphate.
3 tablespoonfuls of molasses or treacle.
1 pint of new milk.
Heat the milk and mix all the ingredients.
Give a dose every 24 hours. When the
animal can eat, give a few handfuls of
bran or pollard with a little chaff.
When it chews the cud it is a good
risk again. If an animal appears to
be a desperate kill-or-cure case, first
drench it with washing soda, dis-
solved in pint of warm water. If it im-
proves, drench with the rock-phos. mix-
ture 24 hours after.
“Louden”: All who keep dogs for
rabbiting and fox-chasing should include
one or two pointer-greyhound crosses in
the pack. The crosses are well-balanced,
symmetrical, excellent hunters, hardy,
game, fast, and have heaps of stamina.
Their short coats are assets in heat and
where grass seeds and burrs give trouble.
They are popular in the timbered hill
country in eastern Riverina.
“6T6”: I feed wheat (grain) to my
horses before the seeding and harvest
time, and in 13 years have not lost one
horse through wheat-poisoning. Thrice
in that time all the horses got to bagged
wheat, and, though they made a mess of
the grain, eating and spilling a number
of bags, there were no ill-effects. I start
with small doses, gradually increasing to
from one to two kerosene-tins to the team
of 10 horses.
“Langwang”: The following is a
Chilean method of harnessing horses to
pull with one trace: A band, or sur-
cingle, is buckled round the horse ; one
end of the trace is fastened to the surcingle
and then, passing around the animal’s
chest, like a breastplate, is fastened again
to the surcingle, and passes on to be
hooked to whatever the horse is required
to pull. The plan answers admirably for
single-horse ploughing or scarifying be-
tween orchard rows without risk of injury
to young trees. It enables a furrow to
be turned close up to the line of trees
without touching them.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What are the prospects for a man with
small capital farming and clearing scrub land
at Dalby, Queensland ? What is the land most
suited for, the general aspect and conditions
pertaining to that district, i.e., temperature, rain-
fall, liability to droughts, etc. ? —45.
Much would depend on the individual and on
the kind of seasons he experienced for the first
few years. Large areas of land in the district
are of good quality and suitable for sheep,
dairying and wheat. The average rainfall is
about 25in. p.a., but there are long, dry spells
sometimes. One of these might be disastrous
to a man with limited capital.
How much fresh milk (not skimmed) would
it require per day to feed a sow kept for breed-
ing purposes ? Would it be necessary to add
water to the fresh milk, and, if so, how much ?
The same questions for fattening porkers and
baconers. Which would give best results — two,
three or four feeding times a day ? With
milk, how much maize in husk is it wise to
feed 3—65.
The best results are obtained when pigs are
fed on a mixed diet —milk, grain and pasture.
Individual pigs need varied amounts, and the
animal’s condition is the best guide. When
used separately and as a sole diet, about Igal.
of whole cow’s milk would equal lib. of grain
or meal and about lgal. of separated milk
would have equal value. However, if milk
and grain are fed together the values of both
foods are increased. For dry breeding sows,
receiving only whole cow’s milk, use 3gal.
daily and watch results. Sows with litters, after
the suckers are three weeks old, could be tried
with sgal. of whole milk. Young growing pigs
should do well on 2gal. of whole milk daily
for each 1001 b. of their liveweight. Three-
times-a-day feeding is recommended. No water
should be added to the milk, but the pigs
should be given water to drink in between feed-
ing times.
HINTS FOR HINTERS.
In addition to space rates, £1 Is. will be paid
for the best hint of the week.
Don’t send a covering letter.
Write your name, pen-name and address on
the top of the first page. Then fire away,
writing on every second line. Don’t waste
words or trouble to begin: “-This is a hint
which I have used for 20 years.” Remem-
ber that 100 words is about the limit of length.
THIS WEEK’S PRIZE HINT.
The guinea has been won by A.
RUSSELL, Belalie, via Bourke,
N.S.W. :
To secure a compact skin pack,
cut two double wires to reach the
depth on each side and across the
bottom of the pressbox with twitching
length to spare. Now cut fouij sap-
lings to fit in the box parallel to the
“monkey.” Put the wires in the box
about three inches from each side,
ends to the top. Then two saplings
on top of them. Put one skin in
whole and tuck the corners under.
Then fold your skins in four head
to tail and then over again. Put the
corner of each skin in an alternate
corner of the pressbox. When the box
is full put another full skin over the
top with corners tucked under. Now
two more saplings on top and two
blocks of wood for the “monkey’
to come down on. Let the “monkey
down and press in the usual way.
When tight, bend your wires round
under the “monkey” and over the
saplings, and twitch. The result is a
neat bale. A piece of old bag may
be placed on top of the last skin and
under the saplings to brand upon.
About 30 full-wool skins can be put
in a bale.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, Etc.
The Wheatgrower’s Plight
C. A. S.. Hawker, the former Minister
for Commerce, who spoke before the
Wheat Commission last week, said a lot
in a short time. The wheat-farmer has
never been in a worse plight; even the
improved position of the woolgrowers,
through strengthening the exchange posi-
tion, threatens to hurt him. As Mr.
Hawker says, any lowering of the rate
must bring about a serious crisis.
But how is it to be avoided? If un-
pegged now, the London /Australia
rate would assuredly drop in favor
of this country. In Maoriland the
bonus to the exporter has been kept
at an artificial rate by a Government
monopoly; but artificial rates are un-
sound. In Mr. Hawker’s opinion
the conceit of re-establishing the Australian
pound at a parity with sterling or gold is just
as superstitious a fetich as the worship of
Moloch.
Many no doubt will agree with him. But
if £lOO Australian to the £lOO sterling is
too low, then £125 Australian to £lOO
sterling is too high. Supply and demand
must eventually regulate the exchange,
unless Governments or banks are pre-
pared to carry the risk. The only other
alternative, in the event of our favorable
overseas balance continuing to increase,
would be a managed internal currency.
Reduction of taxes, said Mr. Hawker,
would give relief to the wheat industry
out of all proportion to its effect on the
general revenue. “Dead capital” was also
mentioned. Wouldn’t it be better in the
long run for lenders to forego part of
their debts and hope for resulting
healthier business conditions to recoup
their losses? In the railways again, dead
capital prevented any worth-while reduc-
tion in freights. As for private capital
that is sunk and gone, the witness recom-
mended that the Federal Bankruptcy Act
should be suspended where it clashed
with any properly-considered State debts-
adjustment legislation.
Apart from the exchange, the ex-
Minister suggested direct assistance to
wheatgrowers. Bounties, etc., paid by the
Commonwealth did not equal payments
made by the industry to Governments
and public utilities. He recommended
the establishment of a grower-controlled
organisation “to regulate the home price
of wheat, which should not be high
enough to keep uneconomic farms going,
but adequate to assist the main industry.”
The recommendations of Mr. Hawker
should be considered with respect by all
those who are interested in the industry.
Objectionable as part of his proposed
remedy may be, thousands of wheat-
farmers must get assistance of some kind
or walk off their farms.
Chain Stores
“K.D.”: The nothing-over-two-and-six
stores, where well-managed, have made
large profits throughout the slump. Only
goods which required little salesmanship
were stocked from the outset ; nothing
which required fitting or altering could
be handled.
Manufacturers of well-established lines
have been able to resist the importuni-
ties of these organisations ; others make
for them large lots of special lines at
prices which leave specialty shops gasping.
Three or four years ago a pair of shoe
laces from a bootshop would have cost
at least 3d. or 4d. ; a Sydney bargain
basement now sells half a dozen pairs for
%
that price. A few striking savings like
that and people begin to drift to the
chain stores for any kind of haber-
dashery. But competition has resulted
in a frenzy of searching for the
cheapest markets ; and large quantities
of Japanese goods have been bought up
at job prices and passed on to the public.
Individual fancy-goods shops don’t
stand a show against the chains. Dozens
of small shopkeepers have been forced
out of existence as a result of their opera-
tions. The self-service principle in sell-
ing has also done away with many shop-
hands, and girl assistants have taken the
place of men even where ironmongery
is sold.
The chain stores, therefore, are not an
unmixed blessing. In America it was
found that chain organisations, with
large capital resources, could be opened
up in a town and goods practically given
away until the weaker individual com-
petitors were forced out of business.
Then the chain unit could charge its own
prices. There has been a great outcry
against the system in Germany, too, and
Hitler has taken action. Now rumbles of
“Does your wife believe in social credit, too?”
“Yes, she always insists on a month’s grace in paying her bridge losses.”
discontent are being heard in Australia
from the direction of grocers’ and re-
tailers’ associations.
“Taxpayer,” from Melbourne:
Re your taxation article (B. 28/2/’34).
Does The Bulletin seriously think that a
person living in Australia who sends his money
to a foreign country is such an exceptionally
desirable citizen that he should be encouraged
by a remission of all taxation?
No ; and The Bulletin never said any-
thing so foolish. But it did say, and still
says, that it is stupid to discourage over-
seas people from coming here by de-
manding Commonwealth income tax and
State unemployed-relief tax on earnings
already taxed abroad. It is an obvious
factor in the loss of population by migra-
tion: 225 persons last year and 3669 in
1932. We ought to be gaining instead of
losing.
* * * *
“Smiler”: The low price of copra is
being felt in New Guinea ; after gold it
is the chief industry. Mullaly, a planter
and a member of the Rabaul Legislative
Council, has been looking round for
someone to blame, and has picked on
Unilever, Ltd., the soap people, and asso-
ciated concerns. Levers are perhaps the
largest users of cocoanut oil in the world,
but they don’t represent the only market
for the product. Whale oil has been a
strong competitor lately, and depresh, of
course, has played the dickens. What-
ever the cause, copra prices are very low
—below the cost of production in many
cases.
* * * *
“King D.”: What is this Bracey plan?
I had a talk with Bracey and asked him
to “boil it down.” Here is his scheme in
brief, for what it is worth:
My idea is that every able person should
have the right to work. The only practical way
to give this right is to have a “Zero Unem-
ployment Total” as the internal base of our
currency—one founded according to the num-
bers and needs of the people. This as a base
acts as an automatic governor to the velocity
of the circulation of money. It is doubt or
confidence, whichever is uppermost in the public
mind, plus gold, which is at present our base.
In other words, a metal and an emotion. Issu-
ing currency for unemployment raises the ex-
change rate (pegged at intervals), which, acting
as a tariff and bounty, helps both the manu-
facturer and the primary producer, whereas a
tariff hurts the latter. Reduced imports and
increased exports will eventually and gradually
wipe out our overseas debt and give Australia
a credit balance on her national balance sheet.
As for danger of political control, an automaton
can be in charge of the system, as there are.
only two totals to be kept at zero—the “Un-
employment” and the “National Balance”
(what Australia owes or is owed). Both of
these totals are statistical and cannot very well
be juggled with.
This alteration to the base means no altera-
tion to the working of the present system. Issue
enough currency to give everybody work. Any-
thing beyond this would be inflation. The
change from gold to sterling was practically
unnoticed by the public, as no change took
place in the working. Nor would any more
change take place by altering from sterling to
a zero unemployment total.

“Fan”: Whatever the result of the
Film Inquiry may be, 1 think it’s high
time picture-theatre admission charges
were reduced. On Saturday nights at
almost any Sydney suburban show d.-c.
seats cost 2s. 5d., plus tax, while stalls
run into Is. 6d. Week nights are nearly
as bad. On Saturday nights children
have to pay full price. I won’t refer to
the charges of the city palaces, because
I know that depreciation and upkeep of
extravagant buildings have to be added
to the price of my ticket; but badly-
ventilated and -furnished brick-and-tin
halls in the suburbs have not lowered
rates since there was a uniform rise
about eight years ago.

“G.A.L.”: Although recent sales-tax
regulations declared patent medicines, for
some reason or other, to be free, the
authorities have not yet made up their
minds about what constitutes a patent
medicine. Tackled on the question by
several leading wholesale houses, they
were still undecided, and left the matter
to the discretion of the wholesalers them-
selves. Vaseline, lanoline, sulphur, iodine
and paraffin oil are taxable ; ointments
used for the same purposes, but sold
under a trademark, bandages and cotton
wool are free. The whole darn sales-tax
question is muddled out of all reason.
It is the biggest handicap Australian in-
dustry is carrying.
* * * *
“Lewlo”: There are some shrewdies
about these days. Gave one a cheque
for “two pounds sterling” in payment of
a £2 (Australian) debt. He demanded £2
10s. from the bank. It didn’t come off,
but the manager cautioned me to drop
“sterling,” as he believed the payee could
legally demand payment in sterling notes.
A client sent a cheque to America for 25
dollars. The bank paid in dollars and
debited the client at current exchange.
Appears that legally you can draw
cheques in any currency you like,
although banks would probably ask you
to go elsewhere if you made a habit of it.

“Wilf.”: I pay for a tin of fish
paste. If I buy about \\ times the quan-
tity in a glass jar I have to pay 10|d. And
I get nothing for returning the jar. Does
the cost of the glass container make all
that difference?
* * * *
“T. Total”: Don’t the Pure Food laws
admit of action being taken against shop-
keepers who pass off citric-acid substi-
tutes as pure fruit drinks? My digestion
was almost ruined by these concoctions.
There are concentrated cordials on the
market “prepared from fresh fruit only”
which would make the basis of easy pro-
secutions.
* * * *
“Double Ex.”: The Customs recently
discovered that numbers of American-
made firearms were being imported to
Australia in boxes marked “British
Proof,” or in wording which suggested
that the arms had been proved in a Brit-
ish Proof House. The British Proof
stamp marks the weapon as first-class
all the world over. All such imports
will in future be prohibited as goods
falsely described, unless actually passed
by a British Proof House.
* * * *
“Drawes”: Holidaying in a N.S.W. coun-
try district, I found that the local store,
which has a monopoly, was retailing tie-
pins of the kind sold in city bargain
basements for 6d. a dozen at ninepence
each, and back studs (penny or twopenny
value) at a shilling. Also butter, for
which the local farmers receive 6id. a
pound, is sold at Is. 4d., 2|d. more than
the Sydney price. Robbery or enterprise?

Dr. A. A. Seymour, who has been
killed by a Toronto tramcar, was in Aus-
tralia for many years and married here. A
Canadian D.D., he first occupied a Pres-

Then he moved to Adelaide’s chief
Scotch church, held many high offices
and helped to found the Scotch College
for boys, and another for girls. He went
back to Canada five years ago.

“Smiler”: “America produced the
largest bubble of artificial prosperity the
world has ever seen” (B. 28/2/’34). Yes,
and it was aided by some of the largest
concerns in U.S.A. During the boom of
1929 20,000,000,000 dollars was lent to
Wall-street by 17 big cos., chief of which
was Standard Oil. Still, Richard Whit-
ney, president of the N.Y. Stock Ex-
change, defends the operations of market
manipulators, and challenges the consti-
tutionality of Roosevelt’s Anti-Gambling
Bill.

“Comeback”: The only difference
between Jean Borotra and the average
prima donna is that the Basque doesn’t

before the public there is nothing to
choose between them. After countless
retirements Jean has gone to the U.S.A.
for the indoor championship of that
country. He rates England’s chance of
keeping the Davis Cup at 2 to 1, placing
America on the 4-to-l mark. Against
Australia he offers 100 to 15; against
France and Japan, 20 to 1.

“Para Prosdok”: “S. M. Herald” sums
up the brand-new Emperor of Manchu-
kuo: “He is deeply versed in Confucius

of the inscription on a tombstone in an
English churchyard: “He was a good
son, a devoted husband, an affectionate
father and a first-rate shot.”

“Centre Court”: Commander Hill-
yard, himself a fine tennis-player and
cricketer in the past and for many years
secretary of the All-England club at
Wimbledon, has watched 40 Wimbledon
tournaments, so must bring ripe judg-
ment to his job of picking the 14 best
players who have come under his eye.
In chronological order they are: The
Renshaw twins, Dr. Pim, the Doherty
brothers, Brookes, Wilding, Tilden, Bill
Johnston, Borotra, Lacoste, Cochet, Vines
and Crawford. Perry is put by for the

Suzanne Lenglen was in a class by her-
self.

“Kick Starter”: English motor-cycle
makers are considering ways and means of
beating the world’s speed record of 151.86
m.p.h. recently attained by German Ernst
Henne. Wright, of England, who has
twice won the record, and was the first
rider to top 150 m.p.h., is advocating a
streamlined machine with the sides com-
pletely closed. This he claims will give
a 25-per cent, greater speed in a machine
of 150 h.p. The A.J.S. firm, which built
Wright’s record-winning machine, has
sent experts to examine the straight 12-
mile road that runs along the top of the
new Zuyder Zee dyke in Holland. If
this comes up to expectations it is prob-
able a special machine aiming at 175
m.p.h. will be built.
* * * *
“Pawang”: The colossal amounts left
by millionaires for one object and another
are giving U.S. tax-gatherers concern.
There are over 300 such foundations,
ranging from the huge Carnegie grant
down to small amounts dedicated to pro-
viding orphaned cats with free milk, and
more than 800,000,000 dollars are tied
up in 108 of them. But the matter goes
further than the perturbations of the U.S.
Treasury. Most of these funds have been
left in perpetuity, which means that there
will be paid secretaries to administer
them until the crack of doom, even if
the object of their founders has become
superfluous. The anti-vivisection move-
ment in Australia largely depends on such
funds. Most of its propaganda is nonsense
and out of date, and is generally an em-
barrassment to scientific research, which
is already sufficiently controlled by law.
The Americans have a particular animus
against the Carnegie hoards because they
are used for propaganda on behalf of
the League of Nations and the World
Court, both institutions which Uncle Sam
abhors. One of the queerest grants is
that of a maiden lady who left £200,000
for the purpose of training the Chinese
in the doctrines of the Tennessee Funda-
mentalists. The result is that the story
of Jonah and the whale is being solemnly
taught as history by salaried professors
in elaborate colleges in the Flowery Land.
As the educated Chinaman is nowadays
more interested in Darwin, Einstein and
Bernard Shaw, the students have also to
be paid.
* * * *
“A. de G.”: What seems an unneces-
sary fuss is being made in the press
because two princes of the royal house
of Sweden have “sullied” their blood by
marrying “commoners.” It depends on
how one regards royalty. In 1810 the
Swedes, thinking to please Napoleon,
made Bernadotte their Crown Prince, the
King being childless and infirm. Before
he became a soldier of the Revolution,
Bernadotte had been a vigneron, which
to Frenchmen means “vine-dresser,” not
vineyard-owner. He succeeded to the
Swedish throne in 1818, after having
joined the Grand Alliance against the
man who made him. He did not die
until 1844. So Swedish royalty, springing
from French peasant blood, is only a
trifle over 100 years old to-day.
* * * *
“El V.” on a distinguished visitor:
Mr. Hendrik van Loon has kindly educated
us poor goldarned Aussies in the truths of
history and philosophy. But some of his wisdom
has been heard before. Mr. Van Loon, for
instance, “wants to .find happiness.” He has dis-
covered that “we are living in the most inter-
esting time in history” ; that “some people
want the millennium in their lifetime” ; that
“the world is paying for the folly of war,” and
that “the old gods are still worshipped and
the old values clung to, though people do not
believe in them any more.” A few thousand
Greek, Roman, Scandinavian, Chinese, British
and South Sea Island and aboriginal philo-
sophers and poets have said the same things,
but otherwise these dicta of Hendrik’s are
completely original.
The Roman Empire, according to Mr. Van
Loon, who lumps mere obsolete authorities like
Mommsen and Gibbon in a flux of “some
historians,” “no more fell than we did. It
changed and passed gradually.” So we may
write out of the history-books Attila and Gai-
seric and the barbarian mercenaries who sacked
the Empire centuries before Romulus Augus-
tulus threw in the towel in his letter to Byzan-
tium, and Gibbon’s statue may now be hauled
off its pedestal and turned into a figurehead for
a tourist ship.
“The world just runs,” says the great man.
“Everything will change, but the human race
will run on. As an optimist, I hope for the
best.” Strangely enough, other optimists seem to
have cultivated an equally bright outlook. Dr.
Van Loon, however, is unique in that his hope-
fulness moved the “S. M. Herald” to the fol-
lowing erudite diagnosis:—
He is a disciple of Heraclitus as well
as of Protagoras and Aristotle.
Protagoras, the most expensive teacher of his
time —he is said to have earned as much as £4OO
for a single course for a single student —until
he was drowned at sea (from which fate may
Mr. Van Loon be preserved!) believed that
men must follow their senses and therefore
might agree to differ. Heraclitus was known as
the “obscure philosopher” or the “weeping
philosopher” because he expressed himself
with difficulty and was for ever cast down by
the follies of mankind. Aristotle was a pre-
tentious person whom the modern world, per-
haps wrongly, regards as overrated —a dog-
matic sort of public auditor of the mind with
a staccato manner and a brain like a card index,
who, nevertheless, despised the practical. He
was greater than his modern follower —he wrote
122 books more than the latter.
So that if our visitor has achieved the feat
of following all three of these worthies to the
satisfaction of a great newspaper he, perhaps,
should not be grudged his little hour of
ballyhoo.

TIBETAN TRAGEDY.
I was telling the Dalai Lama of my
escape from the snow leopard. “As soon
as I struggled free,” I said, “I made
tracks”....
“You made what?”
“Tracks.”
“Tacks?”
“No, tracks!”
The Dalai Lama looked at the Pashi
Lama.
“He means ‘shacks,’ ” said the Pashi
Lama. “He’s a builder.”
“ ‘Slacks,’ ” said the Dalai Lama.
“He’s a tailor.”
“I said ‘tracks,’ ” I corrected, “and I’m
an explorer.”
“Tacks?” said the Dalai Lama.
“Racks?” said the Pashi Lama.
“Tracks, tracks, tracks,” I shouted.
“Oh, tracks! ” said the Dalai Lama
incredulously.
“Yes!”
“Tracks!” said the Pashi Lama omi-
nously.
“Yes.”
“Seize him,” cried the Dalai Lama.
“Grab him,” cried the Pashi Lama.
I was both seized and grabbed.
“What’s the meaning of this?” I pro-
tested.
The Dalai Lama looked at me coldly.
“We suffer no man to make tracks in
Trackless Tibet,” he replied. “Away with
him.”

neat polished armchair complete with
cool canvas coverings and a dinky
brass ashtray, to give the maximum
of comfort,” and a “substantial desk
with ample room for papers and
blotting-pads on which even legislators
devote considerable time drawing weird
designs.” The President, “keen-eyed and
alive to every move in the room,” sits
on a dais facing the assembled Solons.
Sometimes he “smiles tolerantly,” but
“his blue eyes glint when there are big
issues at stake.” On his left the Trea-
surer, who is a small civil servant,
is perched. His “immobile features
give no indication of the responsi-
bilities he carries,” nor is “his wizardry
at finances apparent as he sits” (O
shades of Westminster!) “sucking his
pipe.”
“Hansard,” we are told by the local
print, concentrates on “recording every
vvord that falls from the legislators’
lips,” and at times, “forgetful of Hoyle,
words do fall from various members, in-
terjectory, convincing, irate.” It needs
only to be added that there are three
pubs and a club round the corner to show
that Rabaul is indeed self-governed. The
“Times,” itself managed by an ex-civil
servant, rejoices that the city, 97 p.c.
of the population of which are China-
men and coons, at last boasts a chamber
where local civil servants will make laws
which hitherto have been “thrust upon
us nolens volens from stodgy satellites in
some law department in Canberra.”
The Trepangers
“Chloe”; The trepangers with their
long, sharp iron spears will soon be work-
ing the Rowley Shoals. They go guard-
edly, mostly nude, searching rock surfaces
where the giant sea-worm hangs, his pro-
tective coloring hiding him from all but
experienced eyes. Slung over each fisher-
man’s shoulder is a long, trailing rattan,
and on his back a wicker basket. He
transfixes the trepang when found with
one sure spear-thrust. Presently, the
searcher will have dozens hanging on the
rattan like a grotesque string of beads.
The trepang is 6in. to lOin. in length
and about sin. or 6in. round. It is tough,
like rubber, so that it is not damaged by
being dragged from reef to reef.
When his trepang-cane is full he trans-
fers his spoil to a handy schooner, on
which it is immediately plunged into a
vat of boiling brine for from 20 to 25
minutes. Then comes the task of gut-
ting with a knife —not so nauseous as
might be imagined.
The boiled trepang is drained and
dried, then put in a smokehouse until
the connoisseur declares it ripe for use.
The finished product is exported to
Chinese, Japanese, Malayan and to
Cochin China ports. A paying export
and a growing source of wealth, highly
nutritive, with something of the insidious
palatal charm of caviare to those who
have never seen the fat, wriggling worm
in its habitat. This latter sight cures
any appetite for the finished delicacy.
“Vic”: Tovarisch Stalin has not got a
stranglehold on the name Moscow, which
has been tacked on to a station in Cen-
tral Queensland. Its chief commissar,
Graham Fysh, has just been transferred
to Toolebuc. There is nothing Russian
about that, except the sheep, which, as
everywhere, form a perfect democracy—
docile, never critical and eminently shear-
able when funds are needed by the local
Treasury.

“Rastus”: Is wireless a boon? One
badgered M.L.A. would give a hearty
negative. A constituent, about 400 miles
away from the member’s home town,
heard a wireless account of a bargain
sale, and wired the shocked representa-
tive to buy him a cheap overcoat.
* * * *
“Towan”: A woman who arrived at
Ayr (N.Q.) the other day is surely the
champion long-distance Australian lady
vagrant. She had two little girls, 10
and 12 years old, and she said that they
had walked from Melbourne, friendly
motorists giving them occasional lifts.
Apart from the fact that she was hungry
and annoyed with the Barattas, which
she found too wet to cross en route for
Townsville, she seemed quite cheerful
after her 2000-mile journey. Yet I have
known Ministers of the Crown who,
to avoid a 200-yard toddle to the ferry,
had a Government car sent several miles
to bring them from home to their gilded
cages in the city.

Cooktown has lost its G.0.M., P. E.
Seagren, nine times mayor. He was a
Swede of ancient Sala (Vesmonland)
stock. A cabinet-maker by trade, he
reached Rockhampton in 1871, speaking
no English and with little money. He
joined the Palmer rush three years later,
but fell out of it at Cooktown with £5O in
capital. To him Cook’s city owes most
of its roads and footpaths, and during his
21 years in the local council he never
missed a meeting. He was 88 when he
died—one more victim of the dreadful
climate.

Alex. Leitch, a Murgon (Q.) resident
who died recently, would be a good entry
for the number of positions held by a
public man in a small country town. He
was chairman of the Murgon Shire Coun-
cil, executive member of the Queensland
Local Authorities’ Association, president
of the Wide Bay Rugby League, chair-
“By cripes, got it plenty door, plenty window, Jacky! Think it cold, eh?"
“Yowai, boss! Plurry draughtsman build it.”
man of Murgon’s School of Arts commit-
tee, president of its rifle club, patron of
its tennis club, coursing association and
cricket club, a committeeman of the
Murgon Show Society and the South
Burnett Dairy Association, delegate to the
South Burnett Chamber of Agricultural
Societies, representative of the local
authority on the Wienholt Hospitals
Board, president of the Kilkivan-Wondai
Rugby League and life member of
Queensland Rugby League.

“Murrungurry”: Lakes Eacham and
Barrine, in the Atherton district, are
to-day favorite pleasure resorts, equipped
with boats and a launch, but still they are
“mystery lakes.” They have neither fish
nor fowl; the water-birds apparently
have always avoided them. So have the
abos., who have regarded them for ages
as “debil-debil” holes. Abo. legends tell
of the time when they were craters
formed by “big pfeller fire that jumped up
out of the earth,” and was followed by
“big pfeller water.” The names Eacham
and Barrine are corruptions of the abo-
riginal Yeetcham and Barrang. The
holes, which are two miles apart, are sup-
posed to be connected underground.
* * * *
“Birdum”: There are two optimists in
Australia just now—in the wilds south
of Pine Creek (N.T.). Deserting from
H.M.S. Suffolk, flagship of the China
squadron, during its unobtrusive visit to
Darwin a few weeks ago, they jumped
the N.T.’s only rattler to Pine Creek after
announcing that they proposed to walk
to Sydney. As the distance is only 2900
miles, and there are sundry floods,
droughts and other phenomena in pro-
gress en route, they have not yet arrived,
but if they do not meet any police on
the way and their boots hang out they
should prove a welcome addition to
George Pearce’s attenuated navy when
it is hurriedly commissioned a day or two
before Armageddon.
* * * *
“Aaron Cohen”: I make this loyal
appeal to the old boys of Baxie’s Downs
School, Toowoomba, of the ’97 vintage.
Of the 60 who were there then, I suppose
about 15 are still on deck. Of that 15
I take it for granted that 14 cannot
spare the time. That only leaves me.
If those 14 among them will subscribe
the funds, including all first-class ex-
penses and the same terms as those
allowed cricketers on tour, I am prepared
to journey to Melbourne on their behalf
and there extend a welcome to our old
school friend “Ikey” Vanneck on his
return to Australia as Lord Huntingfield,
Governor of Victoria.

“Colonel Bungstarter”: If the Heaven-
born at Rabaul don’t acquire a little
breeding knowledge to preserve the native
labor stock, there soon will be none left.
In pre-white days pig, shark, man-meat
(on special occasions) and taro grew a
big, healthy population. Now there is
no use for the gurau, the pig-tusk chest
ornament of the graduated warrior.
Hence the pig-meat output is not a frac-
tion of what it was. Man-meat was only
an occasional treat, and there was sel-
dom enough to go round. Amongst
coastal tribes skill in catching sharks is
no longer regarded as a proof of prowess
among young men. With it have gone
the main supply of dried fish-meat and,
more important still, the oil from shark
livers, an essential hydrocarbon. Potatoes
have replaced taro —easier to grow but
far less valuable for carbohydrates or as
roughage. Money has meant store foods,
devoid of fresh vitamins. Shortage of
vitamins lessens resistance to local and
introduced diseases, and greatly lowers
race fertility. Moreover, the strongest
and healthiest young men are recruited
for service, so that the children born are
mostly those of old or unfit fathers.
Without reviving tribal wars or cannibal-
ism, much could yet be done to put
local food supplies and breeding habits
on the old basis ; but action must be
swift.

“Dourga”: Liston-Blyth (B. 28/2/’34)
has had at least four escapes from cer-
tain death other than those mentioned by
“Isee.” In a sailing race on Windermere,
his yacht capsized, entangling him. in the
rigging. After three hours in the water
he was revived. Motoring in Wales, his
car crashed backwards 40ft. over the side
of a quarry, pinning Blyth underneath.
He was unharmed, and when the car was
righted he drove it up the cart track
from the quarry, and then 100 miles to
his home. In Ireland, on a King’s Birth-
day parade, his charger took frjght at
the feu de foie and bolted. He was
thrown and dragged. The leather broke
just as the horse was rising at a stone
wall. In Jamaica, when assistant-adjutant
for musketry, a rifle exploded in his face,
causing the partial loss of the sight of
one eye. Again in Papua, an arrow was
coming straight for his heart, but his
brave native corporal, charging him in
the back, sent him head over heels, re-
ceiving the arrow in his own tunic. In
Melbourne a large touring car ran into
Blyth’s Baby Austin. He was thrown
through the windscreen over the bonnet
on to his head. Picked up by a police-
man, he had nine stitches put in and
then went home. Beat his record if you
can.

“White Wings”: It was a wise move
on the part of the Government to gazette
practically all the Whitsunday Islands as
bird and animal sanctuaries. Long
Island, at the bottom of the group, is
the southern limit of the migration of
the Torres Strait pigeon when it comes
south to breed. They used to arrive in
their millions, and at sundown or before
it white ribbons would be drawn across
the sky as they flew to their nesting-
places. Now they come in hundreds
only. Though it is a cruel sin to shoot
nesting birds, so-called sportsmen on the
mainland cannot be held back from tak-
ing toll. Before the birds were protected
on the islands other vandals slaughtered
them. Only last year a warship, with no-
thing better to do, and wishing to kill
something besides time, pulled in to the
Double Cones. The wardroom had
pigeon-pie that night, and God alone
knows how many wounded birds died on
the Cones while their fledglings starved
to death.
“Australia Jane’s’’ Budget
Pearl Bentley, who used to be a member of
Dalgety’s clerical staff, and who got herself a
job in Japan, has been over here for some
weeks on leave. She goes back to Nippon at
the end of the month after renewing friendships
which extended from Brisbane to Melbourne.
Margaret Birt, who arrived in Brisbane from
Asia'last week, has travelled ever since she left
her cradle. She has taught the young idea how
to shoot in such out-of-the-way parts of the
world as the Seychelles, East Indies and the
Philippines. Casual people who wish to in-
habit the Seychelles should watch their step, as
six months’ gaol is the penalty for pinching a
cocoanut.
The Orford carried away a large contingent
of touring Queenslanders. Among
them were Mrs. John Stitt and her
sister, Miss J. McLeod. Marjorie
Pace was the last hostess to enter-
tain them, and her cups were filled
at Finney’s, between bridge calls.
Mrs. E. R. Pace assisted daughter
Marjorie to entertain the guests.
The members of the Lyceum Club
held a farewell evening during the
week for Mrs. William Smyth and
Mrs. J. Barnard, who left for Eng-
land by the Jervis Bay. One of the
members brought along Pat Hanna
to talk to the mob. Pat talked most
enthusiastically about the British
Israelites.
The southern division of our
C.W.A. confers this year at Too-
woomba, and members of the asso-
ciation have converged on that
from all points of the compass.
Mrs. Edward Farmer is the presi-
dent of the southern division, and
Mrs. Graham Mylne, the State
president, also is keeping an eye on
proceedings. There are 50 rest-
rooms in the division, a thing which
only country women, coming occa-
sionally into a township for shop-
ping, or to visit a doctor or a den-
tist, fully can appreciate. The
cottages at Redcliffe and the moun-
tain cottages provide holidays for
many country families which other-
wise never would see beyond their
own paddocks.
Montrose, the home for crippled children
which was established by the Rotary Chib, now
has a school on the premises. Matron Peters,
who is in charge of the home, is the right
woman in the right place, and the kiddies, in
spite of their handicaps, seem happy and con-
tented.
Joan Budden, who was one of the attractions
of the Paddington Playground, has gone to Syd-
ney for a few weeks to finish gathering her
trousseau c The executive of the Playground
Association passed over an attractive china
lemonade set when they bade her farewell, and
many other delectable trifles have found their
way into her glory-box.
Croquet circles are aghast at the resignation
of Mrs. F. R. Hall, who for 18 years has been
president of the Windsor club. Mrs. A. W.
Bale takes her place. Mrs. Hall resigned
because she is doing a tour of Australia in the
Cathay.
Loma Blacklock, who recently returned from
a trip to England and the Continent, hands
the prize to Australian girls as the best-dressed
summer ladies she has met. According to her
Australian shoes were the best procurable.
Nothing new in that.
Dorothy Rae, recently appointed general
secretary to the Y.W.C.A., was welcomed to
Brisbane by Mayoress Greene, who passed the
brimming teacup in the City Hall in that lady’s
honor. Roses for the guest lent a touch of
color, and pale yellow and red dahlias beauti-
fied the tables.
Michael Erskine-Wyse, who is on Brisbane
“Telegraph” staff, has had a playlet accepted
by 4QG.
The Jervis Bay carried overseas a goodly
collection of representatives of various re-
ligious bodies. There were aboard her the
Rev. W. E. Hurst, president of the League of
Nations Union, and his wife; Mrs. J. Barnard
and Mrs. W. Smyth, who are to attend the
international meeting of the N.C.W. in Paris;
and George Cossart, of Toowoomba, who is a
leading light in Rechabite circles.
Mrs. Bruce Shearer, who arranged and stage-
managed many successful pageants in aid of
charities, has been elected president of the
Arts and Crafts Society. The lady is a Maori-
lander, and Brisbane likes her.
Officials in Burns, Philp scratched their heads
and had goofy sensations when an intending
tourist passed over 8640 English pennies and
£4 in English silver when paying fm a passage
to England. The payer was Miss M. Dittmer,
of Oakey, who, with her mother, intends leav-
ing for England by the Largs Bay next month.
She is a Melbourne girl and a qualified
chemist, and for the last two years has man-
aged a newsagency at Oakey.

Information Sought.
(1) How much did Gene Tunney and Maori-
lander Tom Heeney get when they fought for
the heavyweight championship of the world in
New York on July 26, 1928? (2) Was Heeney
knocked clean out ? —529.
(1) Tunney got 525,000 dollars and Heeney
100,000 dollars. (2) Tunney could not knock
Heeney out, but in round 11 the referee inter-
vened to award Tunney a technical knockout.
/ have always understood that Capt. Albert
Ball, the great British ace, of the 69th Squadron,
was killed in the air by Lothar von Richthofen
{brother of Manfred), but was recently told that
/ was wrong. What authorities dispute his kill-
ing by Lothar? —540.
His death was attributed by the Germans to
Lothar, but the truth of this account is ques-
tioned in the British official history (“The War
in the Air,” Vol. 3), and by Floyd Gibbons in
“The Red Knight of Germany.”
An Australian radio expert is reported to
have said that in ten years it will be possible
for one man to speak over the radio to
200,000,000 people throughout the world, and
that “when the human voice is mounted on
wireless waves it can travel 11,000,000 miles
a second." (1) How could the whole of the
world’s population be reached by radio ? (2)
Isn’t the maximum speed of wireless waves
186,000 miles per second, the same as light?
—482.
(1) Probably Mr. E. T. Fisk, who is reported
to have made the statement, meant no more
than that within a decade every part of the
world will be equipped to receive wireless com-
munication. (2) Yes. But what Mr. Fisk had
in view, undoubtedly, was the prospect of a
world-wide broadcast going out from a centre
over a thousand routes, the aggregate mileage
of which would total the figure he gave. The
maximum time of transmission, of course, would
be not one second, but about one-fifteenth of
a second.
What are the characteristics of the deformity
known as bow legs? What causes it, and how
can it be remedied? —460.
It is a separation of the knees when the
ankles are touching. There is usually outward
curvature of both femur and tibia. It may
occur in one leg only, but is generally found
in both. At birth all infants are bandy-legged,
and attempts to walk too early cause some cases
of the deformity. Another infantile cause is
rickets, which makes the legs unable to sup-
port the weight of the body. Another cause
is horse-riding habitually before the bones
have grown and hardened properly. Treat-
ment depends on cause of deformity and
patient’s age.
(1) What is Communism ? (2) Wherein does
it differ from Socialism ? (3) Which has Russia
adopted ? —382.
(1) Communism is a system which is based
on common ownership of all property. Its
advocates associate with its ultimate objective
preliminary stages before the ideal point is
reached at which all men are equal in posses-
sions and brotherly love. First, for instance,
a “dictatorship of the proletariat” must be
established to “liquidate” the employing and
owning classes —otherwise, to throw them into
the melting pot of the masses. (2) The Com-
munists have the same objective as other pure
Socialists, i.e., common ownership and the
brotherhood of man. It is in method of obtain-
ing their objective that they differ from the
milder parties, which advocate constitutional
methods instead of the violence of Communism.
(3) Both —adoption of Communism involving
acceptance of Socialism.
(1) Have the M.L. Government’s efforts to
establish the qiiinnat salmon met with suc-
cess ? (2) How far north have the fish
travelled since their introduction ? —568.
(1) Yes. (2) They have spread from the
Waitaki River, South Canterbury, where most
of the imported ova were liberated, to rivers
as far as the Waiau, North Canterbury. They
have also established themselves in the Wan-
ganui and Tarawera rivers in the North Island.
(1) Is the official history of the A.I.F. a
work compiled at public expense ? (2) If
such is the case how much has been spent to
date ? (3) Is the compiling still proceeding ?
(4) If a profit is shown on the publication what
happens to it ? —343. ,
(1) Like all official histories, the work is being
written for and paid for by the Government.
(2) About £70,000. (3) Three volumes of the
main twelve have still to be published. Of
these, two are in course of production. Of
two medical volumes, one (partly written) has
still to be published. (4) Any profits go to the
Australian War Memorial. These, however,
arise only in retailing or from sales of reprints
published by the War Memorial Fund.
Particulars concerning Carl Benz, who was
associated with the early development of the
motor-car ?- —443.
He was a German engineer born at Karlsruhe,
Nov. 26, 1844. In 1879 he designed a two-
stroke internal combustion engine and estab-
lished a factory. He later founded the firm
that makes Benz cars. His patents touched
on differential gears, ignition and carburetters.
He completed his first car in 1885.
What are the points of a chow-chow dog ?
—576.
Most characteristic is a black tongue. The
coat should be all of one color —black, red,
yellow, blue or white. White spots are ob-
jectionable, but the hair under the tail and
under the thighs may be of a lighter shade.
Head should be broad and flat; nose moderate
in length, but short tipped; nose and mouth
black; eyes small and dark; ears alert and
carried erect and well over the eyes; neck
broad and firmly set; legs strong, bony and
perfectly straight; feet round and cat-like;
chest broad and deep. The chow has a deep
ruff round the neck and a hairy, full tail,
curled over the back. It should weigh from
461 b. to 551 b.
What were the main features of the Channel
Tunnel Co.’s proposal for a tunnel between
England and France? —ssl.
A tunnel 30 miles long (20 miles under the
sea) costing about £30,000,000, and taking five
or six years to build. There were to be two
traffic tubes 18ft. in diameter. It was esti-
mated that gross revenue would be about
£4,000,000 and net profit £3,000,000 p.a.
Who was Christopher Pemberton Hodgson,
author of “Reminiscences of Australia,” and in
what way was he associated with Leichhardt,
the explorer ? —5BO.
He was a brother of knight Arthur Hodgson,
Queensland landowner and member of Par-
liament. Christopher spent some years at
Etonvale, his brother’s property near Too-
woomba (Q.), and was a member of Leich-
hardt’s first expedition (1844-45). At Leich-
hardt’s request he returned to Brisbane about
a month after starting, as provisions were run-
ning short and the party’s numbers had to be
reduced. As a rumor reached Sydney that
the expedition had been massacred, Hodgson,
in July, 1845, started with a relief party to
ascertain the truth, and followed Leichhardt’s
tracks for seven weeks through scrub and
ranges into open plain country, returning with
the assurance that ‘the massacre story was
baseless. Hodgson then returned to England,
and published his book.
When did the Dutch first land in New
Guinea? When did they take possession of
the western half, and when did the\y first
colonise that portion ? When were the boun-
daries fixed between Dutch New Guinea and
the British and German portions? —47l.
The first landing of the Dutch in New
Guinea, made by Le Maire and Schouten in 1616,
was no more than accidental; and, although
their trading relations with the Molucca Islands,
to the north-west, commenced very early in
the seventeenth century, the Dutch did nothing
further in New Guinea until 1678, when a con-
tract was made with the Rajah of Onin. Even
so, it was not till 150 years later that the
Dutch took formal possession of that portion
of New Guinea west of 141 deg. East longitude,
and colonisation began. The northern half of
the boundary line marking the eastern frontier
of Dutch New Guinea was fixed as between
Great Britain and Germany in April, 1885, but
it was never the subject of a treaty between
the Netherlands and Germany. The southern
half of the boundary was determined by a
treaty between Great Britain and the Nether-
lands, dated May 16, 1895.
How is the academic year at the Sydney
Uni. divided and what are the commencing and
closing dates of the terms ? —535.
Lent term commences on the ninth Monday in
the year and ends on the Saturday before the
twenty-first Monday, with a recess at Easter
not exceeding nine days. Trinity term com-
mences on the twenty-third Monday in the
year and ends with the Saturday before the
thirty-third Monday. Michaelmas term com-
mences on the thirty-sixth Monday and ends
on the Saturday before the fiftieth Monday.
I propose establishing a garden round a house
at Wentworth ( N.S.W. ). The climate is dry and
hot, but ample water supply is available. (1)
What shrubs would be suitable? (2) Suitable
type of hedge ? (3) Suitable and quick-grow-
ing shelter trees? (4) Time to plant trees and
shrubs ? (5) Would hydrangeas do well here,
and time to plant? —4B4.
(1) Buddleia (purple sweet-scented flowers),
arbutus (strawberry-like flowers), callistemon
(red bottlebrush), oleanders (many colors), hakea
(crimson blooms), daphne and hibiscus (ever-
green variety, various single and double flowers)
should do well at Wentworth and other places
where it is hot and dry. (2) Depends on size of
hedge. Privet (green and golden, mixed alter-
nately, which can be trimmed to any design),
duranta (blue flowers), lantana, laurustinus and
veronica are suitable. A wire-netting fence on
which can be grown such perennial plants as
antignon (pink flowers), lathyrus (everlasting
pea), bignonia (all colors), thunbergia (golden
and blue flowers), manettia (orange and red
bells) and the ivy pelargonium would make an
effective “hedge” if erected where hot winds
will not scorch them. (3) Any of the flower-
ing gums, camphor laurel and pepper-tree
(Schinus molle). (4) Any time in March or
April, which will give them time to become
established before the summer comes. (5)
Hydrangeas would grow under the shelter of a
verandah or in tubs and boxes; but they would
soon burn up in the open and are not suitable
in your climate.
Can camellias ( shrubs ) be raised from seeds
or cuttings ? If not, by what method ? —504.
Camellias are not raised from seed; cuttings
from year-old wood placed in a glass-frame
will sometimes take root. The best method is
to layer the low-growing limbs. If they are
too far from the ground place a tin or box
on a stand under the shrub and bend the limbs
into it. Cut the limbs with a slanting motion
where they bend in the soil, and pin them
down. Keep the soil continually moist. If the
foliage remains green after two months you
can be sure that the layers have struck and
the limbs can be severed from the parent shrub.
It is not advisable to shift these layered shrubs
into the open garden until they are at least a
year old.
(1) When did the Lang Government impose
its tax on N.S.W. newspapers, and what was
the nature of the tax ? (2) Did it cause the
Sydney dailies to raise their prices, and to what
extent ? (3) By what means was the Govern-
ment compelled to lift the tax ? —76.
(1) In December, 1926; the tax was |d. per
copy upon every issue of a newspaper whose
circulation exceeded 15,000 and the charge for
which Was less than 3d. per copy. The Act
came into force on January 1, 1927. (2) The
price of daily newspapers was increased by one
halfpenny. (3) A test case was brought before
the Full Bench of the High Court on March
3, 1927. The Bench of five Judges decided
unanimously that the tax was an excise duty
within the meaning of the Commonwealth Con-
stitution Act, and therefore could not be im-
posed by the N.S.W. Parliament.
(1) / am considering the opening of a circu-
lating library in a large country town. Could
it be made a payable proposition, if properly
worked, with 1500 volumes ? (2) Could the
above quantity of recently published volumes
be purchased at an average price of 4s. ? (3)
Names of books dealing with the setting up and
conducting of circulating libraries ? (4) Names
and addresses of the local representatives of
overseas publishers ? (5) Would a newspaper
book-reviewer be a satisfactory person to com-
mission to compile a list of recent publications
to the extent required ? —366.
(1) Doubtful whether anything more than a
very small living could be made out of such
a venture unless it was worked in conjunction
with some other business, such as a bookstore
or a newsagency. (2) Reprints and cheap edi-
tions could be got for less, but, for the library
to be effective, books in current demand would
have to be purchased besides, and these gener-
ally cost about 7s. 6d. each. Non-fiction works
are considerably more expensive. (3) Write to
the Country Readers’ Section, Public Library,
Sydney. A “Library Primer,” by J .C. Dana,
should be helpful. (4) A fairly full list will be
found in “The Australian and New Zealand
Writers’ and Artists’ Year Book” (1929 edition),
but the publishers’ advertisements in such maga-
zines as “Booksellers’ Journal” and “Books
Monthly” should be consulted from time to
time for changes of addresses, etc. (5) Such a
person could give valuable assistance, but local
conditions would have to be studied.
How much do unemployed single men in
N.S.W. receive for food? —468.
In areas where the local government authori-
ties have adopted the emergency relief work
scheme, by arrangement with the Government,
single men are provided with six hours’ work
per week, for which they receive 9s. sd. Where
emergency relief work has not been adopted,
and the Public Works Department has not
instituted a work scheme, food relief is, pro-
vided to single able-bodied men by means of
orders on traders, which are valued at ss. 6d.
per week. In certain remote parts of the State
the rate ranges from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 3d. per week.
(1) Is there a brass musical instrument called
a sousaphone 7 (2) If so, when was it invented,
and by whom ? —344.
(1) Yes. It is circular, and when played is
carried across the body from the right shoulder
to the left hip. The bell is attached to the
main portion of the instrument in an adjust-
able socket, and can therefore be placed at
any angle. The usual position is frontal. (2)
Can’t say. It is a development of the old
circular bass which still is part of the equip-
ment of mounted regimental bands. J. P.
Sousa was the first to introduce the instrument
into American military band equipment.
I employ a charwoman to help with my house-
work, not regular days, sometimes once a fort-
night or once every three weeks. Must I have
her insured under the Workmen’s Compensa-
tion Act ? —2BO.
If there is no permanent arrangement, the
charwoman being engaged separately at irre-
gular intervals, the employment is casual within
the meaning of the Act, and no liability will
attach to you.
Charges involved in bringing a touring car,
in the 15 -h.p. class, from England to Brisbane ?
Difference in customs charges between a new
and second-hand car ? —385.
Packing and freight would cost approxi-
mately £45. In the case of a second-hand car
some allowance is made by the Customs in
respect to the value of components dutiable
ad valorem. Value is generally proved by the
receipt for purchase money. Parts subject to
specific rates of duty must pay those rates even
though value has depreciated by use.
I have a fair knowledge of massage, but I
am not a registered masseur. I am going to
M.L. shortly. Is there a Masseurs’ Registra-
tion Board there and what is the fee for regis-
tration ? —554.
Under the M.L. Masseurs’ Registration Act,
1920, and amendments, there is constituted a
registration board consisting of the Director-
General of Health, a registered medical prac-
titioner and two practising masseurs. The
board deals with all applications for registra-
tion (fee, £2) under the Act. To obtain regis-
tration it is necessary to possess approved cer-
tificates for (a) massage, (b) medical electricity,
(c) remedial exercises and other branches of
physiotherapy. Under the Finance Act, 1932-33,
an annual practising certificate (fee, 10s.) is
required.

THE PALETTE.
The exhibition of contemporary British
paintings on the top floor of Farmer’s
(Sydney) is disappointing. George Lam-
bert’s picture of Talmage, R.A., on horse-
back (Lambert gets in, posthumously,
because of the “British” and despite the
“contemporary”) is the most outstanding
piece of draughtsmanship in the show.
The rest of the stuff ranges from pretty-
pretty to very pretty, with an exception in
the case of “The Girl in the Yellow
Jacket,” by Augustus John. The girl,
poor soul, was probably no more to
blame than the similarly swarthy young
lady painted by Harold Knight, A.R.A.
Knight painted his girl as she looked.
John painted his as he thought she
deserved to look, and the result is un-
pleasant. There are some beautiful
things on the walls: a poster by Orpen,
an impression of boskage by Lamorna
Birch, a water-color by Walcot, “Liner
in Liverpool Docks,” that says almost
everything that could be said on the sub-
ject, and some dry-points by Russell
Flint—much sought after because,
although he is a very good anatomist, he
makes his women resemble ants. But if
this is contemporary British art it is time
a commissioner was sent to London with
some specimens of contemporary Aus-
tralian art.
Mrs. John D. Moore remarked on
opening an “Exhibition of Contempor-
ary Art” at the Pakie Gallery (Sydney)
that Australians shown such works are
required to jump 30 or 40 years in one
afternoon. Mrs. Moore was modest in
her estimate of the gulf to be bridged.
It must be at least 30,000 or 40,000 years,
and it’s a backward jump. One young
gentleman produces a study of the sort
that was barred from public exhibition
just as soon as the human race acquired
the rudiments of civilisation. Another is
so overcome by the beauty of a jugful
of canna-lilies that he draws the jug as if
the potter’s hand had slipped, the table ,
as if the joiner were drunk and the j
flowers as if Nature had mixed mud with '
their colors and deprived them of their
proper curves. A third is represented
by nudes which ought to be purchased
and widely circulated by the ecclesias-
tical gentlemen who say that nakedness
is a sin. The rest is mostly slushy and
obscure.
Artistic Brisbane is still puzzled over
the sudden acquisition (out of the skies I
as it were) of a marble worth about i
£2OOO. It represents Lucrece stabbing
her way out of her troubles. The sculp-
tor was the Italian G. Ginotti, but mys-
tery surrounds the donor—an R.A.F.
officer, Adrian Clarke, a beneficiary of
the late Mateo Clarke. There is no
evidence that he has ever had any con-
nection with Queensland!
Herbert R. Gallop (Fine Arts, Melb.)
sees Sydney through the spectacles of a
convention, but varies the recipe a trifle by
making some of his pictures decorative
in parts and impressionistic in others. He
thus lays traps for the unwary eye, which,
finding in his foregrounds no more atmo-
sphere than is to be perceived in a lino-
leum design, looks for the same formula
in his distances and is surprised by the
suggestion of real air. The result is cer-
tainly a stereoscopic effect, but it smacks
less of Nature than of the stage.
“C.Q.”: Contemplating the stiff and
meaningless classic frescoes by Napier
Waller on the walls of Melbourne Town
Hall, I am set wondering why civic coun-
cils and suchlike corporate bodies invari-
ably let themselves down. When the
Town Hall was being rebuilt after the
great fire, it was rumored that Norman
Lindsay, a Victorian-born artist not un-
known to fame, was to be invited to do
the job. If this had been done it is true
that the designs would almost certainly i
have been somewhat unconventional and
their subject-matter out of the common
run. They would have given right-
thinkers a painful shock; there would
have been an uproar in the press, and
the worthy councillors would have had
palpitations of the heart for a few weeks.
But when the noise had died down the
city would have had something to show
centenary visitors that they wouldn’t have
seen anywhere else. As it is, the inno-
cuous decorations are only recognised,
if they are noticed at all, as stodgy
replicas of a convention that has been
outgrown in Europe for a hundred years.
It is the timidity and herd-mindedness of
persons in authority which cause them
always to achieve the commonplace. The
same thing is about to happen in the
Fitzroy Gardens, where the old decrepit
statues are being removed to be replaced
by “more modern works.” The old
figures had their faults, mainly due to
overclothing in whitewash, but they did
represent a period when one person in
authority had a bit of courage above the
man in the street, namely, Pericles (died
429 8.C.).

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The picturesquely situated No. 11
Onslow-avenue looked very Neapolitan
when the Victoria Leaguers farewelled
Hugh Denison’s lady. The party hap-
pened on a day when the mercury went
whizzing up to the roof of the world, and
perched there, leering down on damp
flesh and melting make-up. But the
Leaguers to a woman wore their white
kid gloves and best frocks, and had to
stiffen their shoulders to deportment to
correspond. Up the red-tiled path, past
the green lawns, out beyond which North
and South Heads could be glimpsed, soft
through the motionless blue veils of air,
walked the guests, glad at length of the
cool gloom of hall and reception-room.
Almost every second guest was a
knight’s wife. The Fuller lady and
the Cook dame did the honors
(deputy-president Miss Macarthur Onslow
is away among the apples of Tas-
mania), the first-named flying a dash-
ing little hat of blue and white diagonal-
striped crepe, a cut off the material of
which her smart frock was made. The
tea was a special effort, and there was
nothing for the afternoon’s guest (who
was a member of the hospitality com-
mittee) to point the finger of scorn at.
Anyway her hands had been filled with
red roses, which contrasted with her
beige georgettes, from which rich laces
dripped in cape effect. A cascade of
white ostrich fronds about Mrs. Roy-
stone Davey’s neck blew gently in the
breeze from many palm-leaf fans. Helen
Scobie’s grey eyes were cool above wave-
green frocking. The Sheldon and Hughes
ladies were among the best-dressed.
Mrs. Walter Swinson’s black crepes
bloomed with blue and gold field flowers.
Lily-of-the-valley gleamed against the
leaf-green of Mrs. H. Dransfield’s frock ;
Mrs. Scrivener, proud of a soldier son
who has just attained his majority in the
Indian service, added powder-blues to
the shimmer of color, and among those
who listened to Elsa Corry’s soaring notes
was Samuel Marsden’s grand-daughter,
Miss Betts.
The Be-Kind-to-Animals Week has
two sides to it. In hundreds of suburban
homes the pampered Terrys, Tozers and
Bonzos have been given titbits in the
form of ice-creams, sausages and French
pastry, and a crop of resentful livers is
the result. The Silkies and the Poms
and the Pekes have to vent their spleen
on somebody, and, too kindly to do so
on the hand that directly feeds them, they
take it out of the butcher, the baker
and the grocer’s boy in snarlful curvet-
tings and frenzied yaps. “The dizzy
limit,” the baker’s boy growled to this
Letter ; “the ginger Peke came bounding
out of the flat opposite just now, and
when I lifted the bread-basket away from
his nose he rounded on me and nipped
a bit from me trousers. And his owner
looked at me as if I were to blame. ‘Oh,
baker,’ says she, ‘can’t you wear trousers
that haven’t been cleaned in petrol in
Be-Kind-to-Animals Week. Petrol disa-
grees with Fido’s stomach! ’ ”
The Forum Club, of which she is a
foundation member, gave a lunch to
congratulate Sarah Hynes, Australia’s first
woman scientist, on her recognition by
Buckingham Palace. The small guest of
honor, beside a prima donna’s cargo of
flowers, made a speech in reply as clear
and incisive as her own remarkable mind.
There was a great rally of clubwomen,
from the presidential Storey lady down,
and a guest of interest was Mrs. F. Aron-
son, who, as a girl, came to Australia
from Sweden on the ship captained by
Miss Hynes’s father.
The opening of the Murray Fuller ex-
hibition in the Blaxland Galleries was
a social omelette of at least 12-egg
capacity. Tag the word “Modern” or
“Contemporary” to an art show and the
modish will come running. In addition,
Mrs. Murray Fuller had bagged the Gov-
ernor to make the opening remarks.
Maoriland was strong among the groups,
and talking earthquakes and aesthetics
were Estelle Beere, artist Violet Bow-
ring and her mother, Mrs. Nelson, and
just-arrived Enzed newspaper woman
Miss Jones. Mrs. Rodney Dangar and
sister Bea McDonald did the walls ; Jean
Cheriton, in coolly patterned blue and
white, had a young platinum blonde, Enid
Board, under her wing, and lingered
before Dame Laura Knight’s “Whitesand
Bay” and Webster’s “Caprice.” Veteran
Julian Ashton, his fine face and sensitive
hand looking like some delicate pencil
sketch, Lute Drummond, of opera-broad-
cast fame, and Dr. Garnet Halloran’s
small wife, who is off to Europe in a
week or two, were others who talked of
line and color.
Daphne Harpur, the Sydney pianist,
who went to London for further study
last August, writes to say that she has
been accepted by 8.8. C. and will shortly
play in an Empire broadcast. She intends
to stay in England till the end of the
year, when she will go to Paris and later
to Leipzig, thence returning to London,
where she intends to settle.
Preparations for the Governor’s Ball
are stirring Sydney to its foundations.
The Governor and Lady Game are going
as Macquarie and his wife. Behind them,
through the doorway of the model of old
Government House, Parramatta, which
will occupy the stage, will step a com-
pany of Blighs, Fitzroys (Police Chief
Childs and his daughter will wear the
raiment of Sir Charles Augustus and his
unlucky lady), Kings, Brisbanes, Phillips
and the rest of those who governed the
colony in its early days.
The Town Hall will represent a city
square as it might have been designed by
Francis Howard Greenway. Hung about
the pillars will be the coat of arms of
every N.S.W. Governor. Artist Norman
Carter’s brush is already busy on this
task, and he and Prof. Wilkinson are
designing the scheme of decoration. Jean
Ranken, the subject of this Talma pic-
ture, who has a string of money-spinners
to her credit, notably last year’s Nautical
Fair, which brought a cargo of gold into
the hold of the Rawson Institute, is lay-
ing the foundations of the dazzling
facade. A model of the Town Hall,
electrics and all, as it will appear on the
night is now on view.
Sydney went to the dogs last week —
“The Gay Dogs.” This revue wasn’t
nearly so abandoned as it sounds, for the
Fairfaxes and the Knoxses turned up in
force, and one member of the C.S.R.
family even handed out programmes in
exchange for the general public’s silver
bits. The revue ran for one afternoon
and two evenings, and drew big houses.
Our maimed and stray dumb friends will
benefit thereby. The programme was
long, glittered with fair women and
brave men, and ran the usual applauseful
way of the amateur show. There were
a “Dream of Fair Women” pageant, a
bicycling scene from the gay ’nineties,
a classic ballet, a Russian scene (notable
for the good singing of Charles Nicis and
Alice Prowse and the harping of Eliza-
beth Rathonyi) and Hebridean songs by
the nice, fresh-faced Gillespie girls.
Therese Desmond ran some one-act
sketches, and Maybelle Markell was one
of the beauties of a “living pictures”
interlude. Clever Mrs. C. V. Baily was
the organiser.
At least the A.B.C. has given Sydney
listeners the chance to hear two operas
hitherto unknown. They are the lovely
and delicate “Iris,” done a week or two
ago, and Catalani’s “Loreley,” sung last
week. After “Loreley” exhilaration
among the principals ran so high that
there were two supper parties, at which
champagne was produced.
This is Sydney architect Mrs. Florence
Taylor, a life member of the Town Plan-
ning Association, who put up a strong
plea a few weeks ago for turning the
Martin-place extension into a civic square.
Now the lady, who is president of the
Arts Club, is working for the permanent
inclusion of grand opera on national
broadcasting programmes at least once a
week or so, and a few days ago she
headed a deputation which bearded the
A.B.C. in its lair. A Dorothy Welding

The cooing of the doves and the chir-
ruping of the birds were drowned when
Mrs. Hugh Munro’s C.W.A. clans met
in the Botanical Gardens to wish her
godspeed. She went off on Monday to
join the other Australian emigrants in
England. All the countrywomen in
Sydney must have been baking all the
morning for the event, judging by the
odor of delicious home-made cakes that
floated out of the rotunda to mingle with
the sweet smell of newly-cut grass. Mrs.
Jimmie Ashton did the mustering, and
headed off those who wanted to mono-
polise the beaming guest of honor. Every-
one had the chance of a word with the
clever lady, whose devotion to an ideal
as well as years of solid organising
work helped to build such a far-reaching
organisation as the C.W.A. Daughter
Nancy Nivison was there in a fresh linen
frock which repeated the pink bloom in
her cheeks.
Last week there was such a rush to
view the picture of Sydney’s first mayoral
fancy-dress ball that shillings positively
poured into the box, and the bell of Dr.
Abbott’s rooms, where the ball com-
mittee is installed, nearly succumbed
from exhaustion. The picture shows an
1843 revel in the old Victoria Theatre.
It tore Social Sydney asunder. There
was great rivalry for the cards, and
families which received them no doubt
felt as puffed up as their neighbors who
did not felt deflated. The picture, which
hangs in the Pioneer Club, is married to
a printed and framed list of those who
really were at the ball. (They knew how
to deal with gate-crashers in those days!)
But the elect didn’t have it all their own
way ; the excluded Peris got busy and
ran an equally ornate (and probably
jollier) ball on the same night.
Clee Villa, one of the oldest homes in
Neutral Bay, is looking its last from its
attic windows, perhaps wringing its
hands a little to think that its long and
useful career as a home is so soon to
end. Clee Villa had its beginnings in
the old whaling days, and proof that
it was mixed up with that trade is a har-
poon which the present tenant, Miss
Swann, found in the rambling stone
cellars under the house. Leading to these
cellars, four big rooms with open fire-
places, is a steep wooden stairway, and
there is a story that from the cellar to the
waterfront there once ran a secret sub-
terranean passage. The old house (which
was later the Mann home) is of grey
stone, its walls very strong and thick, its
windows made up of little panes. In the
garden there’s a magnolia-tree as high
as the modern three-storey house next
door ; there are also a mulberry-tree and
a plum-tree that still persists in fruiting,
though the heart of it has been eaten
away by white-ants. A loquat-tree that
draws all the youngsters of the neighbor-
hood still, and a lemon-tree which flaunts
gaily ripe and green fruit and blossom
all at the one time, are some of the
other joys of the overrun garden that
was planted before 1863. Flats and
bungalows are soon to replace the pic-
turesque, vine-grown bit of old Sydney.
The Queen Victoria, one of the first
women’s clubs in Sydney to be founded
to the glory of music, opened its 1934
season with a bang. The Arts Club was
crowded out, and singer Carrie Lanceley
and Mrs. Walters helped president Mrs.
Arthur Scrivener keep the affair run-
ning with brisk smoothness. Mayoress
Parker, the afternoon’s honored, brought
dove-grey georgettes to a table on which
pink roses and pink carnations lan-
guished. Pianist Carl Budden-Morris
added his artistry to the music pro-
gramme.
There’s a new robot come to town, a
weighing machine. As you step on the
brute, it not only registers your weight,
but in loud, callous, soulless tones
announces your avoirdupois to the world.
Men lend themselves frequently to its
embrace, but ladies, unless of the herring-
bone contour, shudder violently when
they approach, and hurry past on tremb-
ling knees. How could a woman ever
live down the public announcement that
she was 11 stone 131 b. Boz. when she
had always told even her husband that
she just tipped the beam at 10 stone?
There’s still another item tucked into
the list of happenings timed for Prince
George’s visit. The yearly flower festi-
val and war of the roses for the Indus-
trial Blind Institution is to be staged in
time to let the prince have a royal
sniff. A ball whose chief adornment will
be a pageant of the rose queens will
probably be part of the money-raiser.
To a city ballroom on a recent even-
ing came a lady, tall, fair and dressed
in black. The fabric was lace; there
were pleatings of tulle, and it was obvi-
ously as fresh from Paris as the wearer
herself, who was on a world tour. From
the orchids on her shoulder to her little
gold shoes, she was the last word in
fashion. She danced beautifully, and
every woman present glanced her,
not once but several times. “Ah,”
she thought, “they are trying to remem-
ber the details of my model frock so
that they can have it copied.” She danced
more beautifully than ever because she
felt so pleased with her appearance.
Judge then of her horror when she dis-
covered afterwards that she had been
wearing the gown wrong side out!
Tennis champions Harry Hopman and
Nell Hall will be married before instead
of after (as was their original intention)
the Australian players go out in search
of the Davis Cup. March 19 is the
date decided upon.
The Bridge is still a source of conver-
sation to travellers sitting on the outside
seats of ferries. Two women, homeward-
bound for the North Shore, were gazing
at it one afternoon last week. Said the
first: “It’s no use the Government put-
ting up barbed-wire entanglements. What
I say is if people go there to commit
suicide, they’ll do it.” “Oh, but you can
make it too easy,” demurred the second.
“The Gap never became so popular.”
“Ah,” said number ope, “I wonder why. ’
“Because,” said number two, triumph-
antly closing the argument, “the Bridge is
so central.”

There was the attraction of a picnic
meeting about the polo at Moonee
Valley. Cars were parked on the in-
side track of the racecourse and onlook-
ers could either sit in their cars or
on rows of seats placed side by
side on the grass. Sandwiches, cool and
tempting, cocktail-shakers packed in
ice and thermos-flasks supplemented the
fare in the impromptu restaurant on the
“flat.” A fiery north wind blew on the
final day, when the Adelaide team won
the Stradbroke Cup from Melbourne
. Hunt. Lieut.-Governor Irvine presented
the large trophy to C. T. Bray, who
promptly filled it with champagne in
celebration of his team’s first win since
1923. The Irvine lady was a brown-
and-beige figure with a shady hat. Mrs.
Aubrey Gibson emerged from her sedan
in a blue-grey frock and white hat with
a split brim. Mrs. A. V. Hiskens wore
white gardenias upon her black hat and
a silver stripe in her black dress. Mrs.
Teddy Collins was one of the lucky ones
who sipped from the cup. Her daughter
Norme was with her in cherry and white.
Mrs. Norman Cozens, Mrs. C. C. Moore
and Shirley Campbell belonged to the all-
white brigade. Phyllis Bray, in blue, was
one of the most thrilled at Adelaide’s
win. Her father is captain.
Parties and yet more parties were sand-
wiched between a mid-week race meet-
ing and polo every day at Moonee
Valley. For all these festivities there was
not a day cool enough to wear new
autumn clothes with comfort.
Golfers who played at the Metropoli-
tan links in aid of St. Vincent’s Hospital
deserve a special decoration for valor —
only the most virulent species of golf
bug will survive a temperature of
105 deg. There was a large entry list and
proceeds should be substantial. Gengoult
Smith was a competitor who couldn’t
afford to slack up, for his partner was
Mrs. Sloan Morpeth. The Mayoress re-
mained in the vicinity of the clubhouse
and patronised the various verandah
stalls.
Melbourne Hospital had its support
from other self-sacrificing souls on the
same sizzling day. Stalls sprang up like
mushrooms on the lawns surrounding
the J. S. Balderstones’ home in Mont
Albert-road. One could buy knick-
knacks (especially china, of which Mrs.
Falconer Heale had some choice speci-
mens under her care) to keep in readi-
ness for birthdays. Folk dances were
performed in leafy settings, ponies were
there to be ridden, and a picture gal-
lery got its fair share of visitors. Mrs.
A. Schreinder and Mrs. A. B. Collocott
extolled the attractions of competitions
they were managing.
Mrs. Ernest Poolman lit her rose-
colored candles, which were reflected
with scarlet flowers in the ballroom’s
many mirrors, and made the young things
welcome at a dance in her home at
Domain-road. Daughter Audrey, melt-
ing into daffodil pleatings (with a burnt-
orange cape attached to a fichu sash),
and son John saw that long cold drinks
were accessible on such a hot night.
Guests in the house for the week were
Ann Gordon, of Sydney, in white ripple
cloth mingled with gold threads, and
Dorothy Shaw, in a cloud of rose-beige
tulle.
Betty Macpherson and her nine brides-
maids stepped in all-white pageantry up
the aisle of St. John’s, Toorak. The
’groom was Clive, only son of the late
Lieut.-Col. Clarke. The bride, who is
the second daughter of the Leslie Mac-
phersons, wore her gown high and square
across the throat, with wrist-length sleeves
and a decollete back. The beautiful lace
veil, worn by mother at her wedding,
fell from a Russian headdress of leaves
and buds, and more buds trailed from
a bookmark in the bride’s prayer-book.
Her three sisters, Margaret, Ketha and
Kathleen, Betty Clarke, Monica Grant-
ham, Diana Knox, Frances Winter-Irvmg,
Rosemary Knox and Mignon Munro
had each a fish-tail train, a silver twist
beneath the brim of a halo hat and the
escort of a ’groomsman or usher. Wed-
ding tea was served in a marquee in the
bride’s parents’ garden.
When Mrs. Wills-Cooke turned her
thoughts upon next week’s wedding of
Gwen Blogg and Keith Mcßoberts, she
decided that the ’groom should have his
little hour. Accordingly her party, jn lieu
of the conventional “hankie” or “some-
thing pink,” was sherry, and guests
brought something liquid for the newly-
weds’ cellar. At the eleventh hour Mrs.
Wills-Cooke was unable through illness
to be present, but her sister, Mrs. H. F.
Ransford, at whose home the party was
held, rose to the occasion. Among the
stock of bottles brought was everything
from beer to champagne.
Another party on a hot late after-
noon pivoted round Enid Cooke and Dr.
lan Wood, a couple who became engaged
recently while they were both in England.
Mrs. Jim Paxton was hostess, and an
attractive figure in peach-blossom-pink
crepe. Among guests were Vice-Admiral
and Lady Hyde, Mr. and Mrs. Raynes
Dickson, Dr. and Mrs. Alan Mackay,
Marie Greene, Janet Downie, Enid
Riddle (of Sydney), lan Heath and lan
Chauvel.
This is an Austin-Murcott picture of
Mrs. Nicholas O’Donohue, who was
admitted to the Victorian Bar last week.
Mrs. O’Donohue is the first woman in
the State to have completed her law
course after marriage. She will practise
with her husband, who is a partner in
the firm of O’Donohue and Brew. The
couple have a son and heir aged 18
months.
The Richard Thomas couple held their
cocktail-shaking at their home in Glen-
ferrie-road, Hawthorn. The Louis Nel-
kens had theirs at Kyalite House, in one
of those flats with seemingly elastic-sided
walls, for 100 people accepted invitations
to call after the polo.
The Albert-street Con.’s annual record-
ing, which mid-way in the afternoon
shakes itself free of business worries and
becomes a garden party, took place at
the home of Miss J. M. Campbell, in
Kew. Fritz Hart, in absentia, was re-
presented by son Basil, who presided over
the minutes. Miss Campbell, in a mingling
of sky blue and battleship grey, poured
tea in the slightly tempered atmosphere
under the spreading trees.
Madame Gaston Saint is making
another of her periodical visits to Mel-
bourne ; this time she is accompanied
by her daughter, Madame Roger Fort-
homme, and a young grandson. The
figure “Meditation,” in front of the
conservatory in Fitzroy Gardens, about
which there blew a breeze of comment,
was Madame’s gift to the city of Mel-
bourne on her visit here last May.
She is Australian by birth, but since her
marriage to a Frenchman has had her
home in Rouen.
The Vic. railways intend to feed their
patrons with fare primarily intended for
health and well-being. To that end Betty
Wilmot has been chosen from 62 quali-
fied applicants to superintend chemical
processes in the railways’ kitchen. Miss
Wilmot’s science degree, with her special-
ties in biochemistry, bacteriology, path-
ology and zoology (for which she won
the Baldwin Spencer prize), is not reck-
oned sufficient qualification for the man-
agement of the public’s digestion. She
must go to St. Vincent’s for a year’s
special course in dietetics.
The Hebrew Ladies’ Benevolent Society
embarked upon its 81st year of good
works with 60 tables of bridge in Myer s
Italian grill-room. Sales of sweets, cakes
and nuts augmented the funds.
Cupid has victims in Joan, daughter of
the late Rev. J. F. Macrae, and John,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Bellair,
of Harcourt-street, Auburn.
The comparatively new profession of
almonry was introduced to this city four
years ago, when a trained almoner was
engaged by the Melbourne Hospital. So
successful has she been at smoothly dove-
tailing the hospital’s various departments
that an assistant has been appointed. She
is Dorothy Bethune, recently immersed
in hospital and sustenance work at Ben-
digo.
Tulla, the lissome and attractive only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Keating,
is one of the 12 passengers on a Nor-
wegian steamer bound for Dunkirk. Miss
Keating, who pushes a fluent pen in Adel-
aide journalism, has been making the
most of a few days with her parents in
Melbourne. She intends to see as much
as she can of England and the Continent
before returning within a year.
The Shiplovers’ Society has shaped a
centenary suggestion of a windjammers’
race. If the idea matures it will be a very
powerful attraction of the festive season
for there’s no more magnificent sight than
a ship under full sail. If the vessels have
cabin accommodation they won’t want
for passengers.
When you see “The Street of London”
as a film it will probably be winter, so
the snowstorm off-stage and the players’
shiverings and pangs of hunger will fit
neatly into the picture. But some of the
shots were made with the mercury
wobbling above the century, while the
cast nearly died of heat apoplexy
and the ravages of perspiration upon
their make-up. Wattle Path is a torrid
barn at any time, but powerful arc lamps
make it a heap more unpleasant
A death-knell rings for the old man-
sions. Norla, of twenty rooms amid
three acres of venerable trees, was
handed over to the wreckers and reduced
in a few days to a shell of its former
glory. Knight Simon Fraser purchased
the property in 1889. On his lady’s death
last year it passed to her son Neville,
who sold his bequest; for what use is an
old mansion with an expensive upkeep
to a pastoralist? Ten residences (flats
excluded) will rise from the ashes of
one. Careful planning will save many
of the trees.
From Adelaide, in the midst of its
hottest spell for 64 years:
Bowlers say they revel in hot weather —the
hotter the better. The thousand or so of the
clan that besieges kitty now visiting our fair
city had a chance to make good that boast last
week, when for five days the mercury soared
above the century in the shade and the average
was 107. The Queenslanders said they didn’t
mind the heat in the day time, but they were
used to cool nights, and we have been putting
up a record for hot ones.. Bowlers from other
States just panted. Their appetite for cool
drinks was blamed for the city’s ice shortage.
The visitors and their wives were entertained
en masse at the Town Hall on their first morn-
ing, and in the afternoon Mayoress Cain,
assisted by her daughter, Mrs. H. Dunstan, had
a huge tea-party in the banqueting room for
women visitors, who numbered about 300. The
municipal gardens provided a wealth of gor-
geous flowers for decoration. Mrs. Cain wore
petunia chiffon velvet, with a small hat to
match; Mrs. Dunstan chose a beige wool de
Chine, with a touch of blue and green, and a
small beige straw hat. The inter-State women
are very dressy, a different toilette for each
occasion. Bridge and croquet parties have been
given for their entertainment.
The Parsons-Cudmore wedding was at the St.
Peter’s College Chapel, with a reception after-
wards at the North Adelaide residence of the
bride’s grandmother. The bride, Colleen
Mary, elder daughter of Mrs. Roland H. Cud-
more, of Medindie, looked charming in a
princess gown of dead-white satin. The tulle
bridal veil, as long as the train, was held in
place by a narrow coronet of pearls that had
been worn by Mrs. Collier Cudmore, Colleen’s
aunt, when she was married. The bridesmaids
—Margaret Cudmore, Marjorie Hawker, Phil-
lippa McFarlane arid Katherine Bonython—and
the little trainbearer, Patricia Cudmore, were
frocked alike in soft pink georgette with deep
frills of tulle of the same shade over taffeta.
The bridesmaids wore pink tulle veils held in
place by pink pearl bandeaux. The bridegroom
is a son of Justice Angas Parsons. The young
couple left in the Strathnaver on a honeymoon
trip to Noumea.
An afternoon with the thermometer at 107
saw two large cocktail parties—the Goodman
lady was the hostess of one, at her residence,
Palm Place, North Adelaide, and the Dudley
Turners, who leave shortly for England, fare-
welled friends at the other.
Only those keenly interested in tennis have
been able to face the roasting in the un-
covered stands at the Memorial Drive. His Ex.
and Lady Hore-Ruthven were present one after-
noon with their guest the Countess of Shannon.
There was a good attendance at Morphettville
for the Tattersall’s Club meeting. Chairman
Allan Morris and his wife entertained at lun-
cheon and afternoon-tea. Mrs. Morris managed
to look cool in a white linen tweed suit and
large white straw hat trimmed with monkey
fur. Mrs. A. V. Benson wore a white-and-
navy figured silk and a navy straw hat. Mrs.
F. A. Tennant, who never misses a meeting,
chose a black georgette toilette and a becom-
ing black straw hat.
Betty Skottowe’s show of commercial-art
designs at Preece’s Gallery was most suc-
cessful. Forty of her drawings were sold the
first afternoon. She goes to London for
further study.
Perth’s record of an ovenlike week:
Bookies sweltered ’neath their striped brollies
at the headquarters’ March meeting, and
feminine punters were almost too hot to care
how they looked. What breeze there was blew
fitfully through Mrs. Henry Cook’s nut-brown
laces. Pat Sanderson’s outfit matched the
lawns; the square-cut low neck of Mrs. Lionel
Wills’s criss-crossed marocains was concealed by
a discreet neck bow; Mrs. Lyon Johnson's
ice-blue flat crepe was banded with patterned
marine blue; lobelia-blue scrolls ran the length
of Mrs. Harry Vincent’s caped white marocain;
and Mrs. Howard Gwynne’s red and grey
stripes converged diagonally.
To swell the coffers of the Kalgoorlie Relief
Fund Mrs. Rischbieth converted her garden
into fairyland for a Caf6 Chantant. Rainbow
lights twinkled in the trees, music filtered from
Edward Black’s instrumental trio; Linley Wil-
son’s pupils spread butterfly wings in graceful
dance; Alison Lee moved dryadhke across the
lawns wafting wispy scarves of tulle to strains
from Scriabin; fortunes were foretold, flowers
sold and refreshments served, all under the
direction of a black-satin-gowned Kitty Gillies
and peach-ninon-clad Mrs. Mason.
A cordon of Boy Scouts was flung around
St. George’s Cathedral to keep the crowd from
swamping the bridal party at the Cameron-
Cockram knot-tying. With their right eyes
completely concealed by tulle Dolly Varden
hats, Mrs. Robert Jacka, Betty Smith, Mar-
jorie Tindale, Alison Abbott and train-bearers
Beverley Cockram and Natalie Skinner minuet-
stepped the length of the aisle, frou-frouing
swirls of white organza festooned with trails
of fern-embellished milk-white roses. Ena’s
central position in the procession was marked
by lily-leaf fronds of silver tissue, held shield-
wise before ivory duchesse satin so heavily
damascened with silver myrtle as to represent
coat of mail. The chinked and gauntletted
brassards left the shoulders bare; the hauberk
was fretworked with ninon and the surcoat was
elongated into a couple of yards of train
sparking with crystal dewdrops. The diamente
on the tulle veil scintillated at the Esplanade
during rejoicings.
Balingup saw an influx of visitors from the
city and surrounding districts for its tennis
week-end. The Braziers and Hawters housed
about 20 guests apiece and shouldered the bulk
of the organising. The attendance at the dance
in the local hall constituted a record. Nancy
Parker brought her fur-edged pink crepes from
York; Bunbury’s Mrs. Herbert Davies sprinkled
organdie flowers over her white matelasse;
Phyl Hawter swished floral taffetas; rhinestones
studded the halter of Dorothy Kirby’s mush-
room satins; Gwen Brazier’s “dirty”-pink blis-
tered crepe sprouted angel’s wings; sister Phyl
was enveloped in flowing violet silks and Mrs.
Reg Hester gyrated in royal blue satin.
In spite of the heat Pleiades Club members
rolled up with their friends for the dramatic
department’s opening effort of the season. “The
Understudy,” with Dorothy Fallowes, Nancy
Rogers and Viola Bathgate in the main parts,
roused applause and laughter. Veronica Lake
and Mrs. Taylor trilled ditties, Joans Smith and
Fry simultaneously tickled the ivories and Billie
Dingwall wielded the fiddle bow.
Perth Golf Club associates inscribed their
names in an autograph book under their favor-
ite golf tips, and handed it, with a healthy-
sized travelling-bag to Mrs. A. G. Lovell, their
first life member. President Mrs. Hubert Evans,
ensconced behind roses and zinnias, wished the
departing guest a pleasant sojourn in England,
St. Hilda’s O.G.A. put on a high-and-white
tea for Mollie Munroe and Lorna Bird, soon
to enter into life partnerships. Joan Smith wqn
the literary salad competition and the gift dis-
tribution was sandwiched between the musical
items.
The Speck sends a few lines:
His Ex. and Lady Clark motored to New
Norfolk, where Sir Ernest opened the new
Psychopathic Home. The Premier and all the
high lights of the administrative world, the
Bishop, the Mayor and Mayoress, knight John
Gellibrand, representatives of the Red Cross
Society and a big throng of others gathered
for the ceremony and inspected the institution
afterwards. The building is tastefully fur-
nished, and if there is a remedy for a mind
diseased this place should help.
Mrs. L. Hungerford wound up her share of
the season’s entertaining with a party at her
pretty home, Hathaway House. The long
drawing-room was cleared for _ dancing and
decorated in a charming design in fuchsia and
blue shades. The dining-room was set out
for bridge, and supper was served in a marquee
on the lawn, where the stone bird-bath, filled
with water-lilies, made an original addition to
the scheme, and the tables were gay with
sunset dahlias and sprays of copper beech, ine
Lieut.TGov. and his lady were among the guests,
and the officers of the Canberra and Australia
gave their quotas of dancing men. Frockmg
was gay and smart, and the affair went on
very well. Mrs. Hungerford, with her daughter
Mrs. A. N. Lewis, flitted for the mainland with
the Cullens (S’William and his daughter) two
days later.
Vice-president James Murray took charge of
affairs at the Kingston Beach Golf Club on a
day when he and Mrs. Murray dispensed tea and
eatables to a big muster of members and friends.
Visitors from the Royal Hobart, Claremont.
Tea-tree and Huon Clubs joined in the mixed
foursomes handicap.
A committee of 44 girls, town and country,
with Mary Harbottle as hon. sec. and Joan
Scott-Power as treasurer, ran a dance at the
Continental. In the musicians’ gallery, a
scheme of frosted greenery on a white back-
ground was carried out; the rest <of the effects
were in blue agapanthus and variegated bam-
boo, with warmer shades for the supper tables.
Four debs, made their appearance: Noel Brain.
Margaret Burgess, Joan Skeeles and Pat
Gulline.
Both north and south ends of the. island
staged highly successful aerial pageants. For

Consummation.
BY E. MARY GURNEY.
IN the foothills, where the grey of the
tussock breaks against the silver-green
of the bracken, an old mare,
stunted and ungainly, gave birth to off-
spring as stunted and ungainly as her-
self.
The mother-heart of her glorified it
into a thing of supreme beauty, and broke
because the get of her body was dead
before ever it breathed.
Pokaka was old, too old even to be
of any further use to her Maori owners ;
and, as she would not breed, she had
been turned out into the hills, to glean
a scant living, and die, as many a better
horse had died before her.
But, for the curiously blotchy white old
screw, Nature had kept a trick up her
sleeve. In the hills she joined up with a
mob of wild hill ponies, led by a stunted
but virile little stallion ; and Pokaka, so
named because her queer color faintly
resembled the unearthly hue of the blos-
som of the pokaka-tree, had got in foal
to him.
As in some women, so in some beasts,
the mother-instinct transcends all others.
All through her life Pokaka had
mothered things—nickered after other
mares’ foals, suckled poddy calves, and
even known pangs of dumb ecstasy at
the puling nibbling of young lambs at
her hairy legs.
So now the fact of her motherhood
transported her, filling her with an
ecstasy that was akin to agony ; and it
was long before she would face the truth,
and cease to encourage her heart to
deceive her mind.
Then her grief was a human thing,
and terrible to behold.
The dim valley, with its drift of starry-
flowered manuka, rang with her wild
sorrow.
Far down the slopes of the foothills
the herd she had been running with
caught the echo of it, and wheeled into
the wind, standing with heads upflung,
with nostrils distended, staring, wide-eyed
with unease, towards the sound.
Rata, the little red stallion, sensing the
urgency of her calling, the anguish and
fear, asserted his leadership, and went
racing up through the dense, curling
fronds of the bracken, bent on suc-
coring her. In his wake, like the multi-
colored wave of some resistless sea,
surged his tiny herd. A queer, motley
herd, in whose van toiled an aged rene-
gade near-thoroughbred mare; in the
rear a small, jet-black Shetland pony, also
renegade, strode freely, with her lovely
microscopic colt foal skipping gleefully at
her side.
As they ran, some of the wild mares
cavorted and played, but for the most
part, they galloped stolidly, having come
too late to their freedom to know joy.
For them their lives of bitter bondage
had taught them to accept with dumb
endurance, without joy in the present or
hope for the morrow. And yet their pas-
sage through the breast-high bracken was
full of dignity, and tinged with the glory
that is the imperishable heritage of horses.
Perhaps their numbers enhanced the
illusion, crowning them with that wave-
like sense of irresistibility. The spring
sun was lambent, brilliant and soft, so that
the bronze fronds of the bracken were
burnished, and the grey of the manuka
was silver-white. Beyond, the snowy
caps of the mountains scintillated and
gleamed, and the bush-clad lower slopes
were dark-green lands of cool dreams and
pure delight.
Over the silver-grey slopes of the foot-
hills the wild horses galloped, and the
drumming of their hoofs was an accom-
paniment heady as sparkling wine to the
song of a myriad skylarks. The breath
of their passing was pungent with broken
turf, and the little grey rabbits fled before
them, and stole back timidly, to squat,
pop-eyed, in the lane of broken bracken
that they left behind them.
But for Pokaka, the brilliant, breathless,
hushed loveliness of the spring day was
clothed in darkness.
The herd poured up over the last slope
and slid, with many snortings and play-
ful squeals, down through the manuka
grove to the valley bottom, where they
split like a wave against rock, scattering
turf and stones and the flakes of frost-
splintered shale, as they drew up and
formed a ragged circle about the old
white mare.
The snortings and squealings gradually
died away, and the beasts stood
motionless and silent, as though they were
suddenly become aware that they were
face to face with tragedy.
Pokaka stood above the dead foal, with
her ears laid to her neck, her eyes wild
and white with the madness of her grief.
Her muzzle, outstretched, dripped saliva,
and, above the heavy breathing of an
old, broken-winded mare and the uneasy
snorting of the higher-strung near-
thoroughbred mare, the threatening
champ of her worn teeth was clearly
audible.
Rata broke the motionless hush, nip-
ping at the broken-winded mare, who was
crowding him, and moving forward gin-
gerly, with a placating whinny of inquiry.
Pokaka did not move, but the whites
of her eyes turned slowly red, and the
little stallion, sensing the change in her,
paused, still whinnying and weaving his
lowered head, ears flickering nervously.
Then he stepped forward again, moving
on his toes, and ready for instant flight.
Pokaka lowered her head, pricking her
ears, and lunged forward with a swift-
ness amazing in a beast so old
and emaciated. Rata, with a snort
of indignant surprise, plunged away,
so that her worn teeth merely scored
his flank; but his movement preci-
pitated a general stampede. In the
space of a couple of heart-beats the tiny
valley was once more empty, save for
the half-mad mare.
Up the slope was the sound of the
herd’s wild crashings through the
maniika ; and then they emerged into the
bracken and the sunlight, flashed in a
multi-colored stream over the hill’s crest,
and were gone.
Pokaka, alone once more, turned back
to her dead, pawing the earth beside it,
and calling with an urgency that seemed
to hold the very earth in an uneasy hush,
so that tFie black-and-white fantail flit-
tering back and forth in the manuka
boughs stilled his eternal scolding.
The sun swung up to its zenith, and
slipped down towards the west, catch-
ing the hills in a net of luminous splen-
dor. No bird, not even a skylark, mur-
mured in the drowsy stillness. The glassy
slopes of the mountains were sparkling
yet mellow, so that peak melted into
peak, mistily clear against the tender
blue. The bush-clad ridges were motion-
less, cool and silent as eternity.
One by one the wild horses came drift-
ing back, moving leisurely through the
loveliness of the late afternoon towards
the waterhole and their bedding-down
ground.
They went round the ridge above the
valley where old Pokaka mourned. As
they passed, they paused and stared down-
wards, ears pricked, nostrils blown a
little, eyes lambent with a dumb beast’s
unnamed fear and unformed wonder.
Trailing as ever, a few yards in their
rear, came the little black Shetland,
mothering her tiny red foal.
Her companions were descending the
further slope before she gained the crest
of the ridge, with her colt gambolling
beside her. On the top she paused to
stare down fearfully ; and Pokaka snorted
suddenly from the depths, and called
again and again. The pony mare snorted
back, prancing; and the foal, with a
sudden squeal of impudence, swung
round, and went bounding down into the
valley, paying no attention whatever to
his little dam’s fanfare of commands and
protests.
Like a dull, red shadow under the over-
hanging boughs of the manuka, Puriri, the
little red colt, sped, with the ebon shadow
of his mother hot on his footsteps ; but,
though she strove with nerve and sinew,
she could not head his wilful flight.
Down and down to the valley bottom,
out of the covering manuka and straight
and swift as a gunshot into the mad
mare’s flanks! Neighing distressfully, the
Shetland mare managed to swerve aside
and bound on up the opposite slope,
calling wildly as she went. But the foal,
dazed by his sudden stoppage, wheeled
this way and that, answering his dams
distracted calling, but bewildered as to
her whereabouts. And, while he hesi-
tated, Pokaka paused in her transports
of angry pawings and snortings, and
began to nose him inquiringly; began to
lip his flanks and whinny in her throat,
as she would have lipped and whinnied
to her own foal.
Puriri. recovering from his daze and
feeling the warmth of her lips against
his hide, turned to regard her search-
ingly, realised that she was not his
mother, and kicked dexterously, so that
his tiny hoofs buffeted the old mare’s
knee. Then, squealing with mock fear,
he made back up the slope he had just
descended, with the old white mare trail-
ing him with her urgent calls ; with his
Shetland mother, in an ecstasy of anxiety,
pattering frantically in the rear, and call-
ing no less urgently than the demented
old Pokaka.
Up the slope and over the crest, with
Puriri, now thoroughly alarmed, several
lengths in the lead! Old Pokaka fell
back, and the Shetland, giving her a
wide berth, passed her, and presently
succeeded in racing alongside her terri-
fied offspring. When at least he realised
her, he promptly forgot his terror, and
fell to nipping her painfully ; nor would
he keep moving, as his dam desired, to
join the herd, but fell to bucking and
playing, thus giving old Pokaka time to
overhaul them again. Sighting her,
Puriri remembered his terror and fled
headlong, with his mother, no less
fearful, at his side. Over the next hill
they rejoined the herd, which, sensing
the approach of something unusual, stood
grouped about the waterhole, prick-eared
and uneasy.

-BUREAU OP-
The mare and foal raced in among
them, and Pokaka, exhausted but ter-
rible, lumbered after.
Before her the herd parted like chaff
before wind, but, in spite of their un-
ease, they did not leave their accustomed
bedding-down place.
Leaden-footed, but with deadly, un-
relenting purpose, Pokaka followed the
pony mare and her foal. No matter
how they dodged and ran, she gave them
no rest. The sun went down, radiant
death of a radiant day. The dusk was
luminous, with a light that lingered on
the high, white crests; night was a
sudden benediction, crowned with a
diadem of stars.
About the waterhole the horses stood,
dark phantom shapes, tense with un-
ease ; and, here and there, the little Shet-
land mother, desperate and wide-eyed,
fled before the white horror that dogged
her steps. Beside her, Puriri floated,
whinnying with a terror he did not un-
derstand—a terror that lit his big, soft
eyes with a little red flame, that damped
his flanks with dewy sweat.
The drama ended suddenly, for, find-
ing that she could not rid herself of the
menace on her heels, the Shetland pony
turned up the hill. Straight as a sped
arrow she went, with Puriri at her flank
While they twisted and dodged in the
circumscribed space Pokaka kept them
on the move; but now that they
were flying in earnest, tiny as they were,
the old mare was no match for them!
She was not half-way up the slope before
they vanished over the crest. When, tra-
veiling at a staggering jogtrot, she reached
the crest, they were lost to sight under
the stars 5

Dumbly now, with head drooping and
eyes glazed, Pokaka wandered on. The
sun shot up over the mountains, so that
tnetr Jigged peaks were gilt with light,
lhe shadows of the grey tussocks were
long, dark pools of mystery, and Pokaka’s
own shadow danced before her mon-
strously. Rabbits came out and sat sniff-
ing the pure, cold air. Before her, the
skylarks soared, shrill with ecstasy.
The sun was high before she came on
water; nor until she had plunged her
muzzle deep into it did the old horse
realise how parched she was, how weak
from want of food. Yet, in spite of
her starved condition, her madness and
her excess, so urgent was her motherhood
that her dugs were distended with milk.
Under the vast stillness of the night
some of her madness had gone from her ;
but still she ached with an intolerable
ache to mother young
All through the day she wandered on
towards dim horizons that for ever re-
ceded before her; but as night ap-
proached she came suddenly on a wire
fence, and beyond it, through the dusk,
sbe : < J see a faint swathe of green,
a ? d beyond the green a tiny light that
nickered like a red, low-hung star,
. Snortmg a little, Pokaka turned and
ionowed the fence. She knew that the
w . as no star but the light of man’s
habitation, arid the sight of it stirred
within her faint memories of a bitter
bondage. Yet, mingling with those bitter
memories were other memories.
Where there were men there were
horses.
l“ e f ence ended as abruptly as it
began, and, trembling a little with eager-
ness a P d ear and fatigue, the old mare
broke into her staggering jogtrot,

Crazy with fear, the little beast plunged
away against the fence. The slack wires
gave way? jetting it through, and though
it was badly cut it rolled to its feet, whin-
nying with terror. Pokaka answered it,
ran to it, shouldering it away. Dazed
with fear, it followed her.
For two miles, staggering with her
weariness, but transported with her joy,
the old mare led the foal away. When
presently he began to recover from his
fear and to realise that he ran away with
a stranger, she stopped, calling to him
urgently, nosing him and pushing him
round towards her flank,
Parched with his fear, he hardly hesi-
tated. His own dam, overworked and
underfed, had been hard put to it to
supply his needs. He was husky and big
of bone, and old Pokaka had the where-
withal to keep him satisfied,
Presently, sighing with repletion, he
ceased to tug at her teats, and began to
nip playfully at her flanks,
With soft, throaty calls of ecstasy,
Pokaka turned and led the way towards
the hills.
Dan and Uncle Cross the Macintyre.
BY STEELE RUDD.
THOUGH it was a long, long way to
Sydney, Dan and Uncle kept mov-
ing along—slowly, it is true, but
surely. Each successive week saw them
nearer their goal, if only by a mile or
two.
I “The worl’ wasn’t made in a day,”
I Uncle would squeak in his thin voice
| whenever Dan talked of speeding up ;
“an’ th’ man was never born who could
work his way down th’ rivers to Sydney
faster than we’re doin’, not even in the
days of the Isredites. And they walked
by night as well as by day, an’ had
movin’ fires to go by whenever it was
too dark to see.”
To settlers about Tallwood they gave
their services, for which they were paid
by all who engaged them, except one.
He was a corpulent, complacent China-
man, a ringbarking contractor, who
thought they had only been seeking work.
When made to understand that they also
wanted money he broke out in a frenzy
of “No savees” and queer gesticulations.
“Oh to the devil with y’!” Dan said
after persevering with him in vain for an
hour. “Keep your money and take it
to China with you in your coffin when
y’ die. It smells, anyhow.”
Uncle didn’t fret over the loss of it,
either. Uncle’s wasn’t a mercenary spirit,
any more than Dan’s, though a bankroll,
however small, would make him feel like
a moneylender.
“Well, you needn’t make sich a song
about it,” was all Uncle said to the per-
turbed Mongolian, “even if you can’t
savee. Y’ worse than the plague of
grasshoppers, you are.”
So, turning their backs on Tallwood,
the travellers headed for Kunopia, doing
a long, dry, uneventful cross-country
stretch. The morning of the day before
they hit the Macintyre River was not so
uneventful, though. It nearly was a
tragedy. Dan never knew anything “to
go so near happening without hap-
penin’,” except “when he was best man
at Bill Thomson’s weddin’ out west, and
th’ fool parson had half-married him to
the girl before thinkin’ what he was
about.”
At night they had pitched camp beside
a mighty log which once was the trunk
of an old-man gum-tree. As well as a
barricade to the door of the tent, it served
them for a dining-table. So when rolling
himself in his blanket for the night Uncle
lay with his head and shoulders inside
and one foot elevated against the rounded
face of the log.
One of Uncle’s legs was subject to
cramp, and at night he liked to rest it
as comfortably as possible. In this posi-
tion, with only half a sock on his
crumpled foot —the other half had worn
out —he felt really comfortable.
“Would you believe,” he mumbled to
Dan, dozing off, “I can —feel the warmth
of the fire —cornin’ —right—through—
the log—into me —foo-t?”
Dan’s only answer was a slow and
prolonged snore.
At daybreak as the light flooded the
tent Dan sat up. Dan liked to gaze at the
crimson and purple streaks in the sky
and commune with himself before jump-
ing out. After a moment his eyes left
the crimson and purple streaks and
roamed over the sleeping form beside
him.
Uncle’s foot was resting high against
the log, but little more than the toes was

The capitalization of the Bank of New South Wales
is a striking example of how our whole financial
structure has been built upon the thrift of
individuals.
The Paid-up Capital of the Bank is £8,780,000 and

visible. On a second glance Dan saw
that a brown snake was coiled round
Uncle’s ankle, the coils reaching to the
calf, looking as if he had a muffler or a
skin-protector on. The tail was hanging
over the log ; the head lay flattened on
Uncle’s shinbone. It looked snug and
comfortable in that position, as if Uncle
was its mother and was suckling it.
It was an awkward position for Dan.
He couldn’t warn Uncle not to stir, or
not to snore, or not to do anything that
would disturb the snake till he found
some way of rescuing his venerable rela-
tive. If Uncle woke up he’d think he
was leg-ironed and start kicking, which
would be fatal.
But Dan was a quick thinker where
snakes were concerned. Barefoot and
trouserless he crept softly out without
alarming Uncle or the snake. Gliding
round to the other side of the log, he
reached over for a grip of the reptile’s
tail, and with a sudden pull jerked the
thing away, nearly pulling Uncle’s ankle
out of joint, and bringing the half-sock
with it. Next instant he swung the
astqnished snake round in the air and
cracked it like' a stockwhip. Then he
tossed it from him with its neck dis-
located. and its bottom jaw shattered
and bleeding.
Never in his life did Uncle wake from
a night of peaceful rest so suddenly or
with such a look on his face. And never
did he find his feet so quickly.
“Here, what mad trick are you up
to at this hour?” he squeaked indignantly.
“Pullin’ a man outer bed be th’ leg—
you ought to have more sense, Dan!”
His little eyes flashed in anger. “Do you
know you’ve nearly broke my leg?” He
began rubbing it, and feeling it with his
hand. “The one thet was paining me all
day yes’day, too.”
“And do you know,” Dan answered,
calmly lifting the snake and holding it up
to display the full length of it—more
than five feet —“that I saved your life by
pulling this thing off your ankle when
I woke up? It was coiled round you?”
Uncle went white. Without speaking,
he lowered his eyes and began searching
his legs for fang-punctures.
“You needn’t be frightened about it
now,” Dan assured him ; “it didn’t bite
y’. I yanked th’ cow off your leg too
quick.” He tossed the lifeless thing over
the log to the tent, then hopped across
himself. “But you had a hell of a lot of
luck, let me tell you,” he went on,
taking up his pants and looking to see
where his boots were —“a hell of a lot! ”
Power of speech returned to Uncle,
and he was about to say something when
Dan let out a yell, at the same casting a
boot from him.
“One in me boot!” he shouted. ‘‘Look
out for it.” And, dancing round, he stood
ready to attack the fresh intruder.
Uncle scrambled on the log as the snake
glided from the boot. Stepping to the
side of it Dan deftly lifted it, too, by the
tail, but, instead of cracking it, started
swinging it round and round in a spirit
of devilry. Each time he completed a
revolution with it Uncle, crouching in
alarm on the log, was nearly struck with
the head-end of the whirling thing.
“Don’t throw it, Dan! Don’t let it
go! ” he cried. ‘‘Kill it! ”
Dan killed it.
“What was y’ frightened of?” he
grinned. “Did y’ think I’d throw it round
your neck?”
“No, but you might have let it slip.”
Uncle shuddered, leaving the log and
“goose-stepping” about the camp lest
there were still others lurking there.
There were no others, though, so both
finished the rest of their “toilet” in peace.
“That’s enough of this place for me!”
Uncle murmured decisively a little later.
Then it was that they crossed the Mac-
intyre.
There was no water in the “river” at
the spot where they happened to cross.
Only a few bones lay there. When they
scrambled up the southern bank and
were resting, Uncle became cynical.
“An’ thet’s what they call a ‘river,’ ”
he said, shaking his head and looking
down at its emptiness.
“They call it that!” from Dan.
“ ‘The hole was dry, the bed was
bare,’ ” Uncle, remembering some lines of
an Australian poet, murmured, “ ‘the
bones of a wild dog rotted there! ’ ”
“What, libellin’ Orstralia again?” Dan
grinned. “Can’t y’ think o’ somethin’ to
say about th’ birds an’ the wildflowers?”
“Yes,” Uncle squeaked—“birds with-
out perfoom, an’ flowers with no song.”
“Birds or flowers,” Dan said, taking up
his burden again, “won’t buy the baby
a frock. Let’s travel.”
Coming over a rise in the landscape to
Kunopia—Dan reckoned it would be
Kunopia, but Uncle had his doubts, be-
cause the spot wasn’t marked on the map
that he had made himself —the travellers
sighted a signboard by the roadside.
“Butchery. Carl Lossberg, Proprietor,”
was nailed over the door of a small
detached room of a farmhouse.
“Queer place for a butcher’s shop,”
Uncle said as they came nearer.
“Whatever it’s been, we’ll see if Mr.
Lossberg, whoever he is, ’s got any
sausages.”
With that they stepped on to the veran-
dah and, dropping their swags, entered
the shop.
Dan rapped on the counter —a piano-
case supported on two gin-cases.
“He hasn’t got much meat hangin’
up,” Uncle, gazing round, observed, “and
it doesn’t look too fresh, either.”
“Sweet enough, though,” Dan said,
sniffing at what remained of a shoulder.
“But I s’pose he won’t have any
sausages.”
“If he ever saw —saw a s-sausage!”
Uncle began sneezing.
“Don’t sneeze on th’ bloomin’ meat!”
“I’m not s-s-s-sneezin’ on it.”
Taking up a butcher’s knife and steel
Dan, mimicking the ways of a butcher,
rattled one on the other and advanced
menacingly on the hanging shoulder.
“How much did y’ say?” he asked of
Uncle. “Two an’ a half o’ rump?”
At the same moment Carl Lossberg
himself rolled in. A full-faced, fat, fair,
good-natured man was Carl. He was in
shirt-sleeves, and wore a faded greasy
apron and a happy smile.
“Oh! Eh! You help yourself, mine
friend?” he said, understanding Dan’s
little joke ; “but vatch you don’t cut your-
self.” Then he laughed.
“By Jove, it’s a good job you came,”
Dan replied, putting down the knife and
steel, “or I’d have served my friend here
with all he wanted, an’ put the money
in me pocket.”
“I don’t dink dot,” said Carl, “but I
make you vait too long, eh?”
“Not you.” Dan shook his head.
“There’s lots of time. This is the land of
lots of time, y’ know.”
“I dink not —not for vork,” laughed
the other, giving his knife a rub on the
steel; “I run away for time from my
dinner to come here, so now vaht can I
do fo’ you? Some steak? Salt beef?”
“Got any fresh, good sausages?”
Uncle croaked.
“Der sassige?” Carl Lossberg smiled
pleasingly on Uncle, but shook his head.
“You vould haf to make some for your-
seluf, I dink so.”
“By th’ Lord Harry,” Dan put in,
“we’ll very soon do that if you’ve got a
machine about you and some skins ready
—l’m an old hand at th’ game.”
“Oh! You peen a putcher? Dat why
you go to help yourseluf yust now?” And
Carl laughed again.
Uncle saw a chance to give Dan a lift
up. “He’s been in the butchering line
all his life,” he lied. “There’s nothing
he can’t do, from makin’ sausages to
cutting up a bullick and salting it—and
if you happen to want a man”
“Know der peeziness, hey?”
Dan wagged his head modestly and
tried to change the subject “Cut us a
coupler pound of that shoulder for our
supper to-night as you’ve got no saus-
ages,” he said, “an’ cut it thick.”
The side door opened again and Mrs.
Lossberg entered. She was stout and
jolly. Carl cheerfully made the presence
of Dan and Uncle known to her as
though they had been old acquaintances.
Indicating Dan, he said, “He know well
the putcher peeziness, and he make the
sassige.”
“That’s nothing to be able to do,
missus,” Dan said modestly; “anyone
can do those things.”
“No! No! No!” she protested—“not
anyone.” Then, attracted by a patch on
Uncle’s vest, Mrs. Carl Lossberg moved
round to him and inspected it.
“You mend der coat yourseluf?” she
asked, smiling.
“He can mend anythin’, he can,
missus,” Dan lied, “and make anythin’.
He’s a wonder with th’ needle —
makes whole soots of clothes, women’s
as well as men’s. He made my best that’s
packed up outside. An’ he’s won prizes
for needlework at th’ big exhibitions,
beatin’ all th’ women into a cocked hat.”
Uncle blushed miserably, but Dan
hadn’t finished. “And listen to me,” he
concluded, “if you’ve got anything in
the sewin’ line that wants doing now’s
your chance ; give it to him.”
Mrs. Lossberg had abundance of sew-
ing to do, patching and mending and
making that had long fallen in arrears ;
for she had a family of growing boys,
and did much to help her husband on
the little farm and in the shop. Besides,
she had a baby.
Her eyes beamed again, and she looked
inquiringly at her lord.
“Yah,” he acquiesced, nodding and
smiling over the steak he was slicing up.
“Very well, dot is right,” Mrs. Loss-
berg said to Uncle. “You come to-
morrow by der morning and I gif you
all what I haf to sew.” She laughed
sociably.
Uncle looked stunned.

“And about making these sausages,”
Dan put in, “or doing anything about
your killin’-yard?”
“Or if you want a man of experience,”
Uncle interposed, “to buy bullicks to
kill at a profit, he’s the one to buy them
for you. He’s been buying fat bullicks
for the big meatworks in the north for
years”
“You don’t say dot?”
“Well, I don’t talk about it myself,”
Dan drawled.
“Never mind dot! You come and
make me der sassige to-morrow, an’ clean
der killin’-yard, und then we talk about
buyin’ der bullick, eh?”
“I’ll be here at daybreak.”
“Und how much vage you dink you
vant?” Carl asked, pulling a solemn face
for the first time and holding his head
sideways with his ear close to Dan.
“We’ll fix that after I get a good start.
Now, what’s th’ damage on the steak?”
“Oh, dot!” Carl laughed lightly.
“Never mind him either till you get a
go at him too, eh?”
“Cripes, you’re an all-right sort of
butcher,” and Dan wagged his whiskers
appreciatively.
Carl and his wife, standing together,
smiled on Dan and Uncle as if they saw
in them a pair of social-credit saviours.
Selecting Uncle for special notice, Carl
said: “You know some man who him
be like, eh, Rosie?”
Rosie eyed Uncle over and over again,
but could only answer in a puzzled laugh.
“I know who it is you mean,” Dan
broke in, “but see if th’ missus knows
before I tell you.”
Again Rosie laughed.
“Veil, who you say?” And Carl turned
to Dan for his answer.
“Oh, I know,” Dan affirmed, “but you
tell us who you reckon he’s like first.”
“Veil,” the butcher smiled, placing his
hand on Uncle as if blessing him, “he
is yust like Billy Hughes.”
Mrs. Lossberg laughed joyously.
Dan gaped in surprise and said:
“That’s not who I was going to say, but
you are like him, Uncle, boy.”
Uncle himself rose to his feet looking
indignant. “Makin’ a comparison like
that,” he wheezed, breaking into a cough,
“is a bit person-el, ain’t it?”
“Struck it rich that time, Uncle, boy,”
Dan rejoiced when they were outside.
“I don’t know about sewing and mend-
ing clothes, Dan,” Uncle said gloomily.
“It wasn’t me who put this patch on this
vestcoat —it was Sarah. And I never won
prizes for sewing.”
“And it wasn’t me,” Dan countered,
“who was good at making sausages ; and
I never was a buyer of fat bullocks for
meatworks in th’ north or anywhere. But
what does it matter when we’ve got this
bonzer steak?”
These Wives!
BY P. B. SLOCIM.
THERE was a big hooray when Joe
was pulled out of the mob of “emer-
gency-relief workers” and given
charge of a gang. Joe was a good sort;
and, besides, he had a tribe of young-
sters, so the extra threepence an hour
he’d get would come in handy.
But the men who lived near him lost
their eagerness to be in his gang when
they found him asking for jobs on streets
far distant from his home. One by one
they drifted away to handier work until
only Dave and Jack of his original gang
were left. Dave and Jack, too, were
known to live “somewhere the other side
of the suburb,” but they seemed content
to stay with Joe.
The defections didn’t worry Joe ; there
were always plenty of men willing to
work with him. Joe was no slave-driver,
and his watch could stop conveniently at
smoke-oh or lunch-time. But what
appealed to his men most was the habit
he developed of “bogging-in” now and
then. More than one told incredulous
mates of how Joe had grabbed pick or
shovel from him and put in ten minutes’
solid toil.
“Jist keepin’ me hand in,” was Joe’s
explanation of these outbursts of activity.
He was in trouble with his timebook
one day.
“You’d think we were a lot of con-
victs,”‘he complained to the timekeeper
who came to help him out. “None of
us has got names, only numbers. There’s
only two in my lot that I know even the
first names of, and they don’t know each
other’s second names ; I asked them both
this mornin’. Yes, I know ‘A’ means a
single bloke, and ‘B2’ a married bloke with
two kids. If I had ’em in me book ‘Bill
Brown’ or ‘Tom Smith’ there might be
some sense in it, but when you come
lookin’ for ‘A6O6’ and ‘B4 plus A, plus
A99’ ”
With a warning to his men not to
burst themselves, Joe retired to the kerb
and sat in the shade of a tree.
He still had his nose in his timebook
when a lady hove in sight. She paused
awhile watching the work, then stalked
towards the gang. She was a large
woman, and her mien was unprepossess-
ing—so much so that one of the gang,
looking up and catching her eye, returned
hastily to his labors, muttering “Hell!
What a dial!”
She halted behind the unconscious Joe,
glared at his bent back, and blazed forth:
“Get up, you lazy brute! You see those
poor men slaving away, and you sit there
reading a book. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself! Go and help them
at once or I’ll tell the boss about you.”
Joe leapt up. “Don’t do that, mum,
or I’ll get the sack. I was only restin’
a minute.” Seizing a pick from an
astonished worker, he began belaboring
the roadway.
The lady watched him for some
minutes, then stalked away.
“That’s my missus,” said Joe when she
had disappeared round a corner. “And
youse blokes go crook at a man for
gettin’ far away from home! It’s the
first time she’s caught me, though. I’ve
sighted her cornin’ before, and I’ve always
had time to get busy doin’ something.”
“But doesn’t she know you’re not sup-
posed to work, you bein’ a ganger?” came
at him from all sides.
“By cripes she doesn’t!” snorted Joe.
“She’d clout on me trey an hour if she
tumbled. She knows what the other
work’s worth, because she always looks
at me docket to see if I’m trickin’ her;
and she cops the lot. Won’t give me even
a deener for terbacker. Reckons smokin’s
a luxury, and if I must have terbacker I
can grow it in the backyard. As for
beer!”....
“So that’s why Joe picks his possies,”
said Jack to Dave at lunch-time.
“It suits me to be far away from
home,” said Dave.
“Me, too. My wife is responsible for
it, but not in the way Joe’s is. She says
’tisn’t fair to the youngsters for me to be
doing laboring work near home. I’ve
always had a collar-and-tie job in the
city, and they don’t know I haven’t got
it now. I leave home early in my best
togs, and go to the wife’s sister’s place
and change into this rigout; I’ll change
back again on my way home. I’ve never
done this sort of work before, but it’s a
dashed sight better than that dam’ dole.
Still, you know what kids are. The ones
whose fathers are working would be
slinging it up at mine pretty quick.”
“I know,” Dave said. “My little girl
was on hand when I brought those new
boots home, and she asked where I’d
got them. I said Mr. Stevens gave them
to me. Next thing, the kid’s out in the
street telling her mates that I’m a great
friend of the Premier’s and he gave me
a pair of boots! My missus is a bit
like yours ; she thinks it’s a come-down
for me to be working on the roads. She
packs me off every morning with a bit
of lunch, and when I’m not working
here I tramp all over the place.”
“I’m out every day, too. Get fed up
with it sometimes. My wife says it’s
for the youngsters’ sake, but I often think
it’s more for the benefit of a neighbor
who’s always telling her how well her
husband’s doing. He is a builder and
has some big jobs up Narromine way.”
“Narromine way, eh!” said Dave. “I
know that part well; I’ve not long come
from there. You can tell your missus
that woman’s talking through her hat.
There’s no big jobs going on up there—
or little ones, either. What’s the woman’s
name?”
“Barclay.”
“Barclay!' That’s my name. There’s no
other Barclays up there.”
Suddenly Jack laughed loud and long.
“Where do you live?” he asked.
“In King-street, about half-way along it.”
“And I live in the next street, about
half-way along it; so that your back
fence is my back fence.” Jack laughed
louder and longer.
“What’s the joke?” asked Dave.
“It looks as if our wives have been
pulling each other’s legs. I’ve heard my
wife say that Mrs. Barclay’s brother is
staying with her”
“There’s no one staying with her”-
“I know that now. You are your wife’s
brother, and her husband’s doing well up
Narromine way—and I’ve got a good
job!”
“Damn’ fools women are!”. Dave ex-
ploded. “I’ll talk my missus out of that
rot when I get home.”
“I wouldn’t say anything about it if
I were you,” said Jack. “Look here, our
wives are having a tough spin, and if
they think they are keeping up appear-
ances telling little tales like that it’s
up to us to help them. It doesn’t hurt
us. We might have to get up a bit earlier,
and tramp about a bit more; but what’s
that to what they have to put up with?”
Dave thought awhile ; then he said:
“You’re right. It is rough on the women.
We can get away where nobody knows
or cares a damn who we are or what
we do ; but our wives have got to stick
it out at home. We’ll let them keep on
with their little joke, eh, and you and I’ll
go back to taws? You don’t know my
name or anything about me, and I don’t
know you from a bar of soap.”
“That’s the ticket,” said Jack.

Are you one of the thousands of men and
women who either through their class of
occupation or some physical disability are
compelled to lead a more or less seden-
tary life ?
If so 7 you will no doubt find such a
method of living prevents sufficient exer-
cise being obtained and a constipated con-
dition naturally exists. In cases of that
type something is needed to assist nature.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are excellent for this
purpose. You will find them used and praised far
and wide. They stir the Liver, cleanse the Stomach,
and stimulate the Bowels, thus opening and toning the
clogged-up system and making it better able to combat
Life’s Little Daily Ills.

Worms
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN
HOW TO TREAT IT.
Worms, by their movements and the inter-
ruption they offer to the contents of the
Bowels, generally occasion pain or uneasiness
in the Abdomen, sometimes spasmodic, some-
times gnawing and biting, and not infrequently
of a vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the Nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is charac-
teristic of the affection. The Bowels are often
disordered, sometimes relaxed, as in Dysentery.
The appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently alter-
nating with another. The Abdomen is often
hard, swollen, and tympanetic, the breath heavy
or foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and
disposition to grind the teeth during the sleep
are other characteristic symptoms. The effects,
however, often extend beyond the Alimentary
Canal, and various derangements of health
are experienced in consequence, either of the
direct irritation of the worms or of the dis-
ordered digestion which they occasion. Amongst
the most common of these are nervous affec-
tions, such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturbed sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ment of the eyelids, dilated pupils, perverted
vision, temporary blindness and deafness.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to recog-
nise the fact that their little ones are suffering
intense pain and distress, and are practically
irresponsible for the outbursts of temper, rest-
lessness and peevishness, and until some more
serious symptoms appear nothing is done to
alleviate the distress. The symptoms of this
disease arc somewhat variable, but generally
they are so characteristic that no mother
need have any doubts. The best proof of
worms is worms, and if the general conduct
of the child is such as to give the slightest
suspicion a careful watch' will afford ample
proof.
A child who is affected with Thread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an
indifferent state of health. It becomes peevish
and irritable in its temper. Another point
to which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to
start in its sleep, its repose being in the way
of a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation com-
pounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties which
destroy the worms, but cause no injury to
the Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in the
form of a confection or lolly, have no dis-
agreeable taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they would
an ordinary sweet.

The Celebrated NEWCASTLE STEEL is used in the production of
“WARATAH” WIRE NETTING
100% Australian from the iron ore to the fence. “Waratah” wire-netting protects sheep, pigs, poultry and pastures from the ravages of rabbits, wild
dogs and other vermin. Rylands stand behind all “Waratah” products. Every roll of netting and coil of wire bears their identification disc. Preserve this,
it is your protection. Rylands have a suitable product for every fencing purpose, and if you are in doubt as to the right type of materials for specific
uses they invite you to avail yourself of their technical service. Keep Australian workmen employed. An assured home consumption is your best market.
Australians consume 60% of the total primary production of the Commonwealth. Four Australian workmen and their families lose their livelihood for
a week every time a mile of imported netting is used. Specify Rylands “Waratah” wire-netting, and see that you get it.
