SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Aut Diabolus Aut Nihil is the title of a very
remarkable short story which appeared in
Blackwood’s some years ago, and which
now supplies a name for a collection of
stories by the same author. All are good
and clever ; and the diabolical one, in par-
ticular, has a haunting power which has
very rarely been paralleled. Cloth, 4s.
Fromont Younger and Risler Senior is a
good translation of Daudet’s well-known
book. The work was crowned by the
Academy, but the suffrages of readers had
anticipated the honor. “Fromont Jeune
et Risler Ain6” is in the author’s best
manner—simple, dramatic, truthful, and
strong ; for Daudet never forces his effects.
Beautifully illustrated ; cloth, 6s lOd.
Heine’s Book of Songs, translated by
“Stratheir,” is into a second edition
(cloth, 4s). The translation is one of the
best (or, rather, least worst) obtainable,
and about the cheapest.
The Wages of Sin, “ Lucas Malet’s ” very
striking novel, is into a 12th edition
(cloth, 4s).
Pudd’nhead Wilson, by Mark Twain (cloth,
4s), may be read ; but the author’s inspira-
tion grows obviously scanter.
Round the Red Lamp is the title of Conan
Doyle’s new book of tales (paper, 3s. ;
cloth, 45.). The stories are carefully
worked, but there is considerable loss of
interest as compared with the fascinating
yarns about Sherlock Holmes.
Thomas Hardy receives sympathetic treat-
ment from Annie Macdonell in a critical
memoir (cloth, 3s, 9d.). Here is a com-
ment-sentence worth remembering : “The
only real immorality possible in art is un-
truth.”
A Child of the Age, by Francis Adams,
appears in the “Keynotes” series (cloth,
4s. 4d.). A peculiar intensity of workman-
ship makes it interesting, and it is one of
the works on which the author’s reputa-
tion must finally rest.

THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, hut know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ’’
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use but now arrangements have been completed to make
its ’merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic oases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRV
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors.

Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried

several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-

after taking six bottles 1 was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.” *

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
The Editor’s Departure .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He had sat him down, the able
Tanktown editor to think :
Bottles twain were on the table,
And in one of them was ink.
He’d sent out his quarter’s bills, and
He had patiently sat through
The anxiety that kills, and—
The return was one pound two.
He thought sadly of the day when
Up to Tanktown first he came,
And ’twas, “ What's your drink?” and “Say
when ”
Each man wild to sign his name.
Then how fair his hopes did blossom,
Dreaming how with wealth he’d bloat—
Till one brought him an opossum,
And another brought a goat—
(Each in lieu of proper payment
Of subscriptions for a year).
Then he went and rent his raiment,
And got paralysed on beer.
Now he felt in all his fibres
Thirst for slaughter great and grim,
As he thought of those subscribers,
And the game they’d played on him.
Eor he had been lured to Tanktown—
To his most exceeding hurt—
As a festive and a frank town,
Where folk looked on coin as dirt.
Well remembered he the frenzy
Of their joy when he got there ;
And how Fighting Bob Mackenzie
At the banquet took the chair ;
And the speeches that were spoken,
Saying now that he had come,
And the ice was fairly broken
Tanktown would be sure to hum ;
And the fearful kind of asses
Which they all became that night,
With the chairman smashing glasses,
And inviting him to fight.
Well, he’d done his duty fairly
By the district since he came,
And if folk would not act squarely
Surely he was not to blame !
He had brought his fine and high-wrought
Style, that Buskin’s self might please,
Down to writing pars on dry-rot,
And on foot-and-mouth disease.
He had tried—a vain alliance !
To enlighten and amuse,
With the latest things in science,
Deftly mixed with local news.
Thus an article on solar
Spots would head a par. to note
Simpson’s babe had cut a molar,
And a dirge on Duggan’s goat.
And with snake-yarns he had peppered
O’er the Times, the tastes to please
Of the mad and lonely shepherd,
And the bushman in D.T.’s.
Freedom’s fight he’d fought defiant,
As a pen-armed Paladin,
And had pierced, like Jack the Giant-
Killer, many a tyrant’s skin.
As a plotter and garotter,
And a pirate full of guile,
He’d denounced the local squatter,
In a fiercely-scathing style.
Oft he had, too, when left stranded
By his staff, in drunken spleen,
Brought the Times out, single-handed
Bullocking at the machine.
It would tax a strength like Milo’s,
And an iron brain, to keep
Up such strain—to write on silos,
Politics, and scab in sheep.
Thinking thus within his tiny
Office, tears began to flow—
But if he had known his Heine,
As a journalist should know,
Then the words he would have spoken
Would have been, in whole or part—■
‘‘l retire with sword unbroken,
But, alas, with broken heart!”
But he said —“ This life debases.
I must chuck it —though disguised
I should go—l’m sick for faces
Of folk somewhat civilised !”
Vainly Tanktown in the morning
For its editor did ask—
He had gone, and left no warning,
Save an empty whisky-flask.
Days may come when pressmen clever
May respect for Tanktown feign ;
But the Tanktown Times will never,
Never come to life again.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 26, o.
A Fallen Idol.
A pew days ago a brief paragraph in the
daily papers announced that an almost-
furgotten person named Thomas M‘llwraith
had again left for England in search of
health. Nobody took any special interest in
the event ; hardly anybody attended to
witness the departure of the man who was
once, for a brief season, the Tribune of the
People, and who was almost within measure-
able distance of being first President of the
Australian Republic. The idol was so utterly
fallen that scarcely anyone remembered
what he had once seemed to be, and what
be might have been ; if Dagon, when he fell
from his pedestal in Ashdod, had then and
there been broken up for road-metal, his end
would have been no more commonplace than
that of MTlwraith. All that was visibly
evident of the once great Dictator was avast
old man, prematurely shattered and very
feeble, sad of countenance, and otherwise
the mere wreck of his former self. But the
pathos of it lay in the fact that no single
individual, save a few conventional friends,
sympathised with the fallen politician. It
is the common belief that his political career
is over that he will never again be
strong enough, either physically or men-
tally, to appear in the Legislature where he
used to be almost absolute master ;. and he
shuffles off the stage as wholly unnoticed as
if he had been only a super instead of a star
actor of his day. In the period of his great-
ness M‘llwkaith sold his party, and his
alleged Republican principles, and his
country, and his political honor, for a price,
and the price remains unpaid to this day.
And his reward is that the nation which
once held him as a demigod is almost as
unaware of his nresent existence as if he had
never been.
» * *
It is a common saying that the Democracy
is ungrateful, and so undoubtedly it often is.
But, compared to the ingratitude of the
aggregate Fat Man, that of the Democracy
counts for nothing. MTlwraith sacrificed
his whole career for the sake of his own Fat
Man instincts and his fellow Fat Men of
Queensland. Ten years ago he was the
statesman who annexed New Guinea, and
who might possibly have held it if he had
been sufficiently in earnest. It was he who
sacked one British Governor, and compelled
another to knock under in a humiliating
fashion on a question of the rights of the
people’s representatives against those of the
imperial figurehead of state. He asserted the
sovereign rights of Queensland again by .arrest-
ing an Imperial naval officer on board the ship
which he commanded. None of these things
were of any real value to the country, but
they showed the strength of the man and
what he might be and do Were he so in-
clined. He was the first avowedly Republi-
can Premier who had ever held office in
Australia. This was the high-water mark
of his popularity. The country knew him
as a man who was strong and fearless and
capable, and who could do great things if he
chose, and for a little while he 100 .ed as if
he was really going to do something great.
During the period when he stood on the
topmost pinnacle of popularity he might, if
he had cared to say the word a id his party
had been only reasonably faithful to him,
have abolished black labor, founded a btate
Bank, ejected the foreign usurers who now
prey upon the country, imposed a graduated
land-tax which would have broken up the big
estates and rescued the finances from the
slough of despond in which they have been
embedded ever since, and abolished foreign
borrowing. He might even have done some-
thing tangible towards the Federation of
Australia, and if he could have brought it about
the Premiership of the Commonwealth
would have been his almost to a certainty.
There was one supreme moment in
MTlwraith’s career when he might have
done almost anything if he had been a Demo-
crat, as he professed to be, or if he had even
possessed sufficient acuteness to be a Demo-
crat by self-interest.
• * #
But the instincts of the huckster and the
commission-agent were in his soul, and he
did nothing of what was expected of him.
Higinbotham, Avith such power in his hands,
would have aimed at being the greatest
democratic statesman in Australian history,
and have tried to found an ideal state which
would have been a shining example to the
world at large. MTlwraith only saw an
opportunity to be the biggest land-jobber in
Australia ; to gridiron the country all over
with land-grant railways, and make a
stupendous boom, in which there would be
unlimited pickings for the Fat Man in gene-
ral ; to hustle great areas of fertile country
into the market, and make another boom ;
to borroAv large sums for alleged public
works, and make some more boom ; to start
importing cheap nigger-labor on a larger
scale than ever, and to live in an atmos-
phere of financial razzle-dazzle generally. He
quarrelled with his ministerial colleagues
chiefly over a remarkable “ deal” in certain
mining shares. Then he coalesced with his
bitterest opponent, Griffith, in order to
carry through his stupendous scheme of
jobbing away all available Queensland to
railway syndicates. He employed the public
finances to prop up the unspeakable Queens-
land National Bank. He acted as Griffith’s
evil genius wherever that flashy, ambitious
lawyer was not already his own evil genius,
and helped him along the downward path
until Griffith, who had intended to be the
deputy-Providence of Queensland, found
himself the most execrated public man, save
one, in the country, and retired to the
Supreme Court bench to escape from politics,
and his partner, and himself. And then
MTlwraith himself suddenly crumbled
away and no one noticed that he was gone.
* # *
He was never even paid the price of his
apostacy. His land-grant railways were
never built, for the expected British syndi-
cates were not forthcoming. His share
transactions were mostly unlucky. His un-
speakable bank suspended, and reconstructed,
and now leads a feeble existence as a mere
shadow of its former self. His borrowing
policy came to grief through the stringency
of the British money-market, and the land-
boom which was to make all the Fat
Men of Queensland rich didn’t eventuate.
MTlwraith to-day is vastly poorer than
he was in his proiesiedly Republican days,
and his comparative poverty, like that
of Queensland in general, is mostly caused
bv the great schemes for which he aban-
doned his Republicanism and deserted the
National Party. His further reward consists
in the fact that, while he was still remem-
bered of the people, he ivas the most widely-
execrated man in the North and in political
oblivion.
* * *
MTlavraith, a few years ago, rejoiced in
the reputation of being the one essential
man in Queensland politics. Had he proved
the Democrat that he professed to be he
would have been essential, for it was he who
brought the National Party together,
and in his better days he the
only alleged Democrat Avith sufficient
influence to keep that motley political army
in a state of discipline. The belief that he
Avas an indispensable force in Queensland
public life was pleasant to his vain and
inflated soul, but when he abandoned his
ephemeral creed that distinction went with
the rest. M‘llwraith, the Democrat, was
indispensable, for there was no other man
of sufficient strength who was prepared to
take the leadership under the same condi-
tions, and to profess the faith that he then
professed. MTlwraith, the unsuccessful
railway syndicator, the land-boom apostle,
the advocate of borrowed money and nigger-
labor and Imperialism, the magnate of an
unsuccessful bank and the director of an
unlucky tinned-meat company, was nobody.
Every Fat Man in Queensland was ready
and willing to take Ids place, and even the
most ordinary Fat Man was able to fail —
under the same hopeless conditions - just as
successfully as he did. Therefore, when
sickness compelled him to drop out of the
race he did not even create a vacancy. The
sun rose and set, and the shares of the Q.N.
Bank dropped steadily, and the land-boom
didn’t come, and the cheap nigger-trouble and
the shearing riot and the deficit all arrived
regularly, just as before. Parliament allowed
the fallen Dictator to draw his Ministerial
salary —as a sort of charitable allowance —-
for work which he didn’t and couldn t per-
form, and which he will probably never per-
form again, and which really doesn’t matter
in any case seeing that latterly it consisted
mostly in helpless waiting on the Fat Man’s
Providence ; but except that his name still
appears as a nominal member of the Cabinet
he might as well have never existed.
* # *
The moral of MTlwraith’s career, is that
political apostacy doesn’t pay, and that the
Fat Man is a worse master to serve than
even the Democracy. If the fallen potentate
of Auchenflower had been true to his trust
he might have done a great work, and when
he died he would have been followed to the
grave by the ephemeral regrets of all Aus-
tralia, and the people would have promised
him a stupendous monument of polished
marble, which, as likely as not, would never
have been forthcoming. As it is he will be
regretted by no one, and his monument
would be the curses of the entire nation, if
it were not that the unstable community has
already forgotten what he was, or what he did,
or what he left undone. His apostacy
shortened his lease of power ; it paid no
cash dividends ; it filled his life with bitter-
ness ; and, so far as his political importance
went, it made him a nothing. When he dies
he will be as little missed as if a cart-
horse had dropped on its daily round.
Therefore, The Bulletin repeats the solemn
warning—a warning which should be written
large over the door of every House of Par-
liament, and over the Speaker’s chair, and
the seat of the President of the Legislative
Council, and embossed on the Parliamentary
notepaper, and engraved on a brass-plate on
the Premier's door, and written everywhere
where every politician can see it—Apostacy
doesn’t pay.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Patriotism of Running Away.
As a fine sample of a purely Australian variety
of patriotism the following, from Sydney Tele-
graph, is worth quoting :
The Turner Government, instead of expiring with some
remnants of dignity clinging to it, is fattening itself on a
vegetarian diet, with a view to prolonging its graceless
days in the land. In other words, it is voraciously
devouring the leek flung in its teeth by the Legislative
Council, and asking for more. . . “1 1 view of the
attitude of the Legislative Council, it has decided to drop
its land-value taxation proposals for the present.” That
is the candid confession of the trembling officeholders
who are now administering Victorian views. . . Of
course the Government could hardly be expected to resign
over such a mere trifle as having forfeited the confidence
of Parliament. . . So the Government is on all-fours
before the dominant House of Have, and hopes, by
“going through” the public once more, to get enough
revenue without needing to finger the big private money
ba >-g. . . The already shrivelled and shrunken muni-
cipal subsidy is to be reduced by £lOO,OOO, so the country
districts will be filled with almost impassable roads, along
which unemployed maintenance men will flounder vainly
from place to place seeking work.
This is how young Australia is taught his poli-
tical duty by the particular darned fool who is
set up as his instructor. That the facts in the
above shriek are wrong in every separate
particular doesn’t matter so very much. The
Turner Government hasn’t forfeited the
confidence of Parliament; it has still a big
majority in the People’s Chamber, and it never
had, and was never expected to have, the con-
fidence of the Chamber of Property. It hasn’t
44 dropped” its land-tax proposals £ the situa-
tion is simply that the forms of Parliament
prohibit them being brought forward again this
session, and something must be done in the
interim. Also the reduction of the municipal
subsidy of £lOO,OOO means ,£lOO,OOO more land
and property tax, for the local bodies will have
to make up the loss by levying extra rates.
But the matter which calls for most execration
is the assumption made by so many cheap and
nasty patriots that a Government can only
show its purity and disinterestedness by re-
signing at the earliest opportunity and leaving
the country in the lurch. The Turner Cabinet
was returned with a large majority in the
Assembly, for the express purpose of squaring
the finances. It hadn t a majority in the
Council, for the nation, under the present con-
stitution, couldn’t give it one, but it had the
biggest support that the nation could give
it.° Then, being defeated in the Council, its
duty, according to the doctrine of cheap and
nasty patriotism, is to leave its majority, and
the country, and the finances in a worse state
than before, aud fly in order to save its
own mean little dignity. Its retirement
wouldn’t help the land-tax in any way, for no
Government which attempts to pass a laud-tax
will get any more support in the Council than
Turner’s has done ; it would only increase the
existing confusion and make the deficit worse,
and deprive Victoria of the services of about
the best Government which can be formed out
of the existing materials. The Telegraphs
theory which, unfortunately, is also the
theory of most of the ignorant demagogues of
Australia —is that every Government holds
office only for the sake of the salary, and never,
by any chance, has even a semblance of a desire
to help its country in any way ; and this cheap
and nasty variety of patriotism is one of the
many things which help to degrade Australian
politics. Victoria gave the Turner Govern-
ment a distinct mandate to stop the awful
accumulation of deficits. It tried to do so in
the best way possible—by levying a land-tax ;
but being blocked by an obstacle which even the
nation hasn’t the power to overcome, it proposes
to try what it considers the second-best ex-
pedient instead. Whereupon the Tory press,
and also a section of the press which calls itself
Liberal, declares that the only pure and truly
patriotic thing to do under the circumstances is
to bolt, like a Chinese army, after the first
defeat, and leave the country to the mercy of
Fat Man, without a second effort. Common-
sense would say that, so long as the Popular
Chamber supports him by a strong majority, it
is Turner’s duty to keep up his end of the
fight against the House of 48 Rich Landlords
to the bitter end for the sake of the country ;
but, according to the Telegraph and the rest
of the Fat press, the politician who stays to
see the trouble through is a sordid money-
grubber, and the only true hero is the politician
who runs away.
Borrowed Money and Produce-Prices.
Editor Bulletin, —Of the four propositions
you give me to consider the last shall be first : —
(4) “ The fault ia with the principle of the loans—not
the interest.” Which is exactly what Tub Bulletin said.
Why should “ F.” argue at such length and so indignantly
to prove that he agrees with this paper ?
As to argument, you heeded it, and that
absolves its guilt and pardons its error ; as to
indignation, that always goes with conscious
virtue, and I repudiate it. You set forth a
good test-question thus :
(1) When a country has to pay a fixed debt with pro-
duce that is steadily declining in value, how can produce
help being a fair criterion ?
Produce would be a fair criterion if the amount
of exertion needed to produce it remained
constant, and all monopoly - premium were
eliminated. Wheat, for instance, was 565. in
’73, and is only 265. to-day—but the difference
does not represent loss to the farmer, or we
would be face to face with the proposition that
in ’73 a profit of 30s. a quarter was made on
wheat. If we say that the farmer in ’73 made
15s. a quarter, and that the cost-price remains
the same—then the farmer of to-day is losing
15s. a quarter. (Vic. Tories are saying at this
moment something like this, so it may be taken
as disproved). There are at least four causes
for the drop in selling-prices of produce :
(i a) Increased competition.
(6) Cheaper and better machinery.
(c) Cheaper and quicker freight.
(d) Cheaper domestic supplies.
The latter three cheapen the cost-price as well
as the selling-price. The very influence which
cheapened our prices has enabled us to increase
our output. Here are figures showing the leaps
and bounds of the New South Wales wool
exports, not only in weight, but in value :
1872 .. 50,233,45311)8. .. £3,342,900
1887 .. 224,295,2091b5. .. £9,200,071
1892 .. •• £10.211,456
In wheat-production Maoriland sprang in 20
years from 3,391,634 bushels to 8,378,217
bushels, and Victoria from 4,752,289 bushels to
14,814,645 bushels. Queensland, which owned
1,343,093 cattle in 1873, owned 6,591,416 two
years ago. The New South Wales tallow
export, worth .£176,798 in ’72, sprang to
£432,322 in ’92. Till ’79 the exportation of
killed fresh meat from Australia and Maoriland
was nil, and now it is what it is. The average
Australian butter-export was 1494 pounds
avoirdupois during ’Bl—’9o; in ’94 it was
£500,000 sterling for Victoria alone. These
figures seem to show that if the interest is to
be paid in produce, then the produce is avail-
able. The joke of the tiling is that the people
who own the produce escape taxation for the
most part. In the past Australian Treasurers
have depended on
Revenue-taxes at the Customs, which penalise the
wage-earner principally ; . ,
And land-sales, which are a mortgage of posterity s
birthright.
To-day the Customs revenues are shrinking,
and the land is giving out. The time is come
for direct taxation. I do not think that the
land-tax would decrease production—in fact, I
think this almost a flaw in the land-tax. Aus-
tralia will regret going in so heavily for frozen
meat and dairy produce exports. In the matter
of wheat, Australia got a bad bargain. There
are other countries that can more easily feed
Europe. Argentina’s wheat product jumped
from a nominal amount in ’Bl to 3,986,000
bushels in 1884. And as it was with wheat, so
it will be with meat and butter. What is
wanted is an Australian National policy that
will eschew the export trade for its own sake.
Let exports be the accident, not the aim of
Australian industry. Protection (not revenue
customs) and Federation can give us an autonomy
free from the sweating vices of inferior races.
Then :
(2) Tub Bulletin never said that interest should drop
with the price of produce. If interest did, then it would
follow that the principal should drop also.
The Bulletin is poking fun at me. If produce
were a fair criterion of value, then a quantity
of produce fixed in accordance with values at
the time of floating the loan would be a just and
equitable return for both principal and interest.
If produce were a fair criterion, then, as the
gold-value of the produce dropped, the gold-
value of principal and interest should drop too.
(3) If The Bulletin had said so, still it doesn’t follow
that wages should drop also.
Employers are already attempting to use the
“fall in prices” to “bear” wages, and it is
because of this that I took the liberty of dis-
cussing my aspect of a certain Bulletin para-
graph. —F.
A Rousing Fight:
Several N.S. W. Legislative Councillors reckon
on stirring results from Attorney Slattery’s
proposed reference of the local Payment of
Members Act to the local »Supreme Court,
If the court sustain the interpretation now
sought to be given to the words of the Act, a


situation of unparalleled difficulty may be
easily created. And a strong faction in the
Council is determined to make the most of the
opportunity. This faction, regarding a struggle
with the Lower House as inevitable in the near
future, prefers to strike on a question which
will give it the advantage of defending the
supremacy of locally-administered law. If the
den mcrats of the Lower House insist on appeal-
ing to the Privy Council, they will put a rod in
pickle for their own backs afterwards,
and if they draw their salaries while
the appeal is pending they will father a prece-
dent of an obnoxious kind. There is no doubt
that the will of the country sanctions payment
of members, and that the Lower House repre-
sents the country in that particular ; hut the
soul of the constitution under which Parliament
lives is that the Lower House can give elfect to
the will of the country only along certain lines
of procedure. If Reid goes on paying and
“ never minding ” the Supreme Court decision
in a matter affecting his own pocket and the
pockets of his fellows, why does he not act simi-
larly in a host of other matters which involve
the interests of the community, but which are
at a standstill for want of legal sanction ? If
he re-introduce the Bill, it is certain it
will be rejected by the Upper House. It
passed that Chamber on the last occasion
by a majority of only one, and that one,
John Davies, declares he will now oppose
the measure tooth and nail. Then if the (pies-
tion be remitted to the country there will be
witnessed the weird spectacle of Reid, who
still asserts that he is opposed to payment of
members, calling on electors to remodel the
Legislative Council because it also is opposed to
payment. Nor is Dibbs in a better position,
aior is Parkes. Both are pronounced opponents
•of payment. The three chiefs of the Lower
House will consequently have to agree before
the constituencies—first, that payment of mem-
bers is wrong in principle; second, that the
Upper House is, in condemning it, also wrong ;
and, third, that they three who believe it
wrong, but who at the same time want it
‘carried into law, are the true saviours of the
•country. The rough and ready plan of paying
members, notwithstanding the adverse decision
•of the Supreme Court, will expose the members
•so receiving pay to prosecutions both protracted
•and expensive, and it is certain that those
prosecutions will be started as the Council’s
•reply to the move; while, as for creating a
batch of new councillors, there is confidence that
fthe new Bill, or the desired amendment of
'the Act, will be rejected by such a majority as
will make it impossible for Reid to swamp it.
Altogether, the situation appears to have been
•cunningly planned by a party which comprises
'some who fight for fight’s sake, others who
ifight in hopes of blocking legislation now in
band, and still others who fight because the
battle will provide rich spoil for the bandits of
(the bar and their hungry little jackals.
Queensland Separation.
'Ogden, Labor M.P. for Townsville, Q., counsels
“downright obstruction” until the Southern
majority in Parliament agrees in disgust to
'Central and Northern Separation. Well, any-
thing rather than the present policy of
•apathy—which to outsiders seems to justify
MTlwraith’s boast that “ Separation is dead.”
The burden of keeping up the agitation is now
•cast on the Labor-members, in spite of the dis-
inclination of the Southern Labor authorities to
•do anything which may lessen their influence
by creating equal and independent authorities in
the Centre and North. It is plainly of no use
for Separationists to trust to genteel silver-tail
politicians, whom it is easy for the Govern-
ment to nobble with a lectureship or a port-
folio, like Black and Philp, or to frighten
through the banks. Yet the desire and need
for Separation grow every day more obvious.
The only two journals of importance, north of
Brisbane, which oppose or would delay
it, are the Northern Miner at Charters
Towers, piping to the order of a capitalistic
proprietary ; and the Townsville Bulletin, a
timid exponent of monopolistic dread of the
Labour-party. Hardly another newspaper fails
regularly to point out that the revenues
of the Centre and North are being every
year misappropriated to make up the deficit
of the South; that Southern Government
of the Centre and North is unfair and
incapable, and must always remain so ;
and that the longer things are left as at pre-
sent, the greater will be the debt that is being
piled up by the South for Centre and North to
liquidate. The Labor-party, and Central and
Northern politicians generally, are making a
great mistake when they let Separation slide in
the anticipation that “ the justice of the cause”
will some day move the Imperial Government
to interfere. Separation should be put in the
forefront of the battle; it should take pre-
cedence of almost every other question ; and it
should be shouted in season and out of season
until the South is forced to yield assent to the
creation of two new independent self-governing
provinces to divide with it the immense terri-
tory of Queensland.
Tiie Rue Australian Resurrection.
The Rue Australian wheel is round again to
the old credulous notch, and a fresh consign-
ment of devotees is off to be sacrificed on the
altar of Lane. Some of them are wives whose
husbands are already in Argentine bilboes ;
others are belated pilgrims who paid their
cash down a year ago without getting a
passage, and have now borrowed more to
ensure it; and the remainder are people
who have apparently slept right through the
newspaper commotion about the jiggers, and
the flies, and the fever, and the vermin, and
the lost ideals, and the blank and utter desola-
tion of settlement life, and are sailing off into
the unknown with the old eternal hope of
better things in which the first emigrants
exulted before experience had taught them
sense. This sudden resurrection of the
Rue Australian corpse, after every sensi-
ble person had definitely interred it,
shows that no one should ever presume to
imagine he has plumbed the depth of native
folly in average humanity. To most people
Rue Australia was a very far back number, and
the only question of pressing importance in
connection with it was—when were the Aus-
tralian Governments going to bring back the
stranded mates ? Anil now the Sublime Crank
rises up and proves once more that the ordinary
rules of logic don’t apply to him, and that the
evidence of failure which convinces everybody
else is not enough to convince him, and that he
is, in fact, just the same old simpleton that he
always was. This perfectly natural and per-
fectly unexpected behavior has for a first result
just this : that the lone lorn Rue Australians
who have been represented as wringing
their hands on the South American shore,
and weeping for their passage-money back
to Australia, may continue to wring and weep
until further notice. For it is now plain that
until the horrid Rue Australian corpse admits
itself that it is dead, and washes itself, and sends
for the undertaker, it is of no use whatever
for any Australian Government to find the cash
for burying it. If it will persist in getting up
out of its grave and dancing in its shroud, it must
simply be permitted to dance until it is ex-
hausted. When there are found people so
obstinate or so stupid that they persist in going
oil to Rue Australia without in the least know-
ing how they are to get back again, it is plain
that, once a safe return is guaranteed in case
of emergency, half the Australian population
might wish to undertake the trip. The spectacle
of the Rue Australian Association continually
sending new adventurers away while Govern-
ment is continually bringing the old ones back,
cannot be contemplated with satisfaction by the
taxpayer who is asked to stump up a salvage
fund for the derelicts. Evidently Rue Aus-
tralia must stew in its own juice a little while
longer before it will deign to appear reasonably
grateful for being lifted out of the fire.
The Brotherhood of “Loyalty.”
The gilded Mr. Henry Wrixon read a paper
lately at the Colonial Institute—subject: “ The
National Significance of the Ottawa Confer-
ence ” (where he figured as a delegate from
Victoria) a dull, platitudinal, drivelling,
grovelling sermon upon the beauty of “ silken
bondage,” as understood by the Wrixon frater-
nity. “To my mind,” droned the oppressive
knight, “ the significant feature of the Ottawa
gathering was the warm feeling of common
brotherhood towards the Australians that it
evoked from the Canadians —a brotherhood
founded upon the fact that they were all sub-
jects of the same gracious Queen.” It goes
without saying that a person who drags the
fiction of Y.R.’s “graciousness” about with
him is a constitutional libeller of national char-
acter. The worthlessness of Wrixon’s evi-
dence is betrayed at once by the greasy
little word “gracious.” Nature has ordained
that Tory loyalty shall be blind to the
absurdity of its pet phrases, and deaf to the
titter which they provoke from the world at
large. The lack of all sense of the ridiculous
in “ loyal ” cant and customs is bound to hasten
monarchy’s doom—but this by the way. Mr.
Wrixon libels Canada most outrageously with
his assumption that the country greeted him as
a subject of an old lady in Great Britain.
Forty-nine out of every fifty Canucks cared no
more about Wrixon and the other delegates to
that Ottawa Conference than Australians in
general cared about a certain Parkin, who
came out here from Canada some years ago to
push the Imperial Federation League. Parkin
(the only man who ever wore a belltopper in
Far Northern Queensland) was banqueted and
cheered by little knots of Freetrade blather-
skites. He, too, revelled in the Wrixonic
delusion of a brotherhood based upon inter-
national reverence for the same gracious Queen.
He misrepresented Canadian sentiment among
people who entertained him with an exactly simi-
lar perversion of the truth as regards Australia’s
feeling towards the “mother country ” and its
figurehead. Parkin subsequently read papers
to imperialists who were ready to swallow his
“facts.” Wrixon has been doing likewise.
Also, it was a significant feature of the recent
Colonial Institute meeting that the opinions ex-
pressed by Wrixon’s paper tvere warmly
endorsed by Parkin aforesaid. The circle of
“colonial” drivel and grovel is so very small
that when W rixon had his yarn to tell Parkin
was beaming in the immediate vicinity. He
personified the w'arm feeling that the other
man spoke of. The Canada known to Wrixon
is almost entirely inhabited by Parkin, whilst
the Parkinian Australia is chiefly the land of
the late “Money” Miller’s son-in-law. The
two countries, as known to their respective
masses of population, are held loosely together
by ties of blood and language, especially bad
language re Messrs. P. and W., but the gracious
Queen is no factor in their mild friendship.
She is merely a link between Parkin and
Wrixon, nor can the brotherhood of those
dreary romancers be fairly called “ common.”
On the contrary, it is a highly genteel sort of
fraternity, attired in West of England cloth,
and remarkable for its regular attendance at
church.
Fat Man Finance.
Mr. Wynne, of Vic. Legislative Council,
was seized the other day with a great idea
whereby the province, he reckons, can save
.£150,000 annually and thus obviate the
necessity for any more land-tax for years to
come. Victoria is paying about £260,000 per
annum to a number of pensioners of the average
age of 63 years. If the country borrowed
£2,250,000 at 4 per cent, it could with that
amount either pay each man the cash-value of
his pension in a lump sum, or else, if he refused
the lump sum, buy him an annuity in a first-
class insurance society, and thus get rid of the
whole crowd. The interest on the loan would
be £90,000 per annum, and by adding 1 per
cent, for a sinking-fund the debt would be
extinguished in 50 years, the total cost of in-
terest and sinking-fund being £112,500 a year.
Probably it would be rather less, 4 per cent,
being an outside estimate. The country, as
already mentioned, is now paying £260,000 per
annum, so Wynne demonstrates that by this
great financial scheme he would save £150,000
every year. What he does not point out is that if
the province staggers on as it is doing at present,
most of its pensioners —almost all of them being
persons of great age—will be dead in ten years,
and the burden will be lifted for ever; while
under the new scheme it must go on paying for
half-a-century. The choice lies, practically,
between paying ,£260,000 annually for about 10
years (equal to £2,600,000), or £llO,OOO
annually for 50 years (equal to £5,500,000). It
is only one more development of the mean,
foolish, thriftless system of passing on the bill
to the next generation, and The Bulletin
hereby denounces Wynne as a financial ass and
a Micawber of the worst description. “ It is
right that posterity should bear part of the
burden,” says Wynne. Why is it right ?
The Cloven Hoof.
Thus the Argus on the present position in
Victoria :
The one task of the day is to put the interests of the
land in a healthy and prosperous condition, all other con-
siderations beiiijf subordinate to that.
This is a fairly frank and honest statement of
the Tory position, for the Argus. The re-
sources and energies of almost every community
can be bluffed into making the dominant
interest more dominant, and if bluff can win in
Victoria the Argus holds a handful of trumps.
When popular opinion is excited it declares
itself bound by democratic principles, and then
when re-action, which is languor, sets in it
asserts, without arousing derision, that the land-
owners’ cause is the cause of democracy. To
suggest that the State shall come to the
assistance of the men who have made bad
speculations in land is not midsummer madness
—in Victoria. It is magnificent bluff; and the
chances are that it will win for the present.
In the past the land-monopoly has had the
cream off Victoria’s milk —and now it wants
the skim-milk as well. The land-boom was
the Tory gospel of monopoly and greed put into
practice; the reconstruction-time was a fanatical
repetition of the same fanatical gospel—and
now, in the hour of her repentance and abase-
ment, Victoria is asked to re-affirm the hideous
lie that the community belongs to the land.
“ The one task of the day ” is to put the com-
munity into a healthy and prosperous condition.
It should be protected, in the first place, from
its inveterate enemy, the land-monopolist—and
the instrument to cut the creature’s claws is the
Land-tax.
Honor among Spiritualists.
Mrs. Besant’s excuse for not exposing the
cheat of the bogus Mahatma —that “she pre-
ferred to suffer under a charge of fraud rather
than divulge private documents ” —shows a
total misconception of “the point of honor.”
It is a misconception very much akin to that
which accuses Mr. T. S. Henry of ungentle-
manly conduct because he exposed the Mellon
spook trickery in Mrs. Mellon’s own house,
and without giving her warning, though he
had previously been on the very best terms
with the whole spooky fraternity. Yet
Mr. Henry unquestionably did right, and
Mrs. Besant as certainly did wrong. The
code of conventionality was never intended
to shield fraud. Nobody has any right, for
example, to become party to a crime by con-
cealing it, simply because knowledge of the
crime came under a pledge of secrecy. The
etiquette of private communications, of hospi-
tality, of friendship, is merely a kind of low
morality, by which those who cannot do chival-
rous things of their own motion are trained to
do them by force of habit and for the sake of their
fellows’respect. Butitcannot claim tohamperor
supersede the higher morality which forbids to
injure others by hiding from them truth which
they have a right to know. To see one’s best
friend engaged in gross deceit, gaining by that
deceit money or esteem from credulous persons,
and to make no sign, is to take the guilt of the
deception upon one’s own shoulders ; and the
friendship which demands such a sacrifice is
not friendship, and can never claim friendship’s
privileges. Would any man, knowing that
only by exposure he could save the victims,
hesitate to expose a friend who was a deliberate
poisoner ? And should there be more regard
for one who poisons men’s bodies than for
another who poisons men’s minds ?
The Logic of Tallow.
A person calling himself “ Storekeeper” writes
to the Sydney Telegraph to state that some
time ago he sent a quarter-cask of tallow and a
bundle of sheepskins 134 miles by rail, and the
freight (165.) nearly swamped the proceeds.
Therefore, Commissioner Eddy is a failure, the
system of State ownership is a failure, and if the
railways “ were worked by private companies
the Government would gain and the public
would be served in a far more efficient manner.”
This faith in private monopoly on the part of a
man who is presumably intelligent enough to
run a store is touching in the extreme. Aus-
tralia has more railway accommodation in pro-
portion to population than any other country
on earth—it has six times as much as Great
Britain, Ireland, France or Germany, about
eight times as much as Austria, Holland,
Belgium and Spain, twelve times as much as
Italy, fifty-three times as much as India, and
considerably more than the U.S. or Canada.
No country where railways are built solely by
private enterprise is one-third so well-served
as Australia, and yet the Government is con-
sistently cursed for not serving it better.
Despite this lavish service, in New South
Wales, last half-year, the expenses were cut
down lower than in almost any other country
in the world —much lower than those of the
United States, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland,
France, Germany, Russia, Austria, Italy,
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium,
Switzerland, Roumania, India, and South
America. And, as there were no dividends to
pay to any private shareholders, the rates were
also cut down as low as they could be cut —so low
that even with all this extraordinary cheapness
of management they didn’t quite pay interest
and expenses. And yet “ A Storekeeper ” who
believes that the world revolves round his own
quarter-cask of tallow, hasn’t' the slightest
doubt that “ private enterprise” would be a
vast improvement on this state of things. His
logic is that when a very small quantity of a
very low-priced product can’t be sent a very
long distance profitably, something dreadful
must be wrong with the whole system ; and he
never even dreams that in “ private enter-
prise ” countries there are abundance of pro-
ducts which can’t be sent profitably by rail for
exactly the same reasons as in N.S. Wales. A
good many Australians evidently don’t know
when they are well off.
*
The New South Wales railways and tramways
report for the half-year ended December, 1894,
is probably the last which will be issued under
Mr. Commissioner Eddy’s management. It is
also the best of the series. The revenue has
increased by £20,000 when compared with the
corresponding half-year of 1893, and the expen-
diture has diminished by £75,000, making the
net profit £95,000 better than it was a year ago.
The railways are now worked for the amazingly
low expenditure of 46J per cent, of the total
earnings—which is very nearly the lowest per-
centage in the world. A few years ago Com-
missioner Speight declared that it was impos-
sible to work the Vic. railways for an
expenditure of less than 05 per cent, of the
gross earnings, and the fact that Mr. Eddy
has reduced his expense account nearly
20 per cent, below this estimate and
has still kept the lines in splendid order
is a striking testimony to his business capacity.
The present New (South Wales Commissioner
has doubled the net earnings of his department,
chiefly by economy and skilful management, and
his total value to the province has been some-
thing like two and a-half millions in cash.
Under these circumstances it would be worth
the Government’s while to offer him <£lo,ooo a
year to remain. Or if he won’t remain, he
should be asked to nominate some man as like
himself as possible to be his successor. One of
the most abjectly pitiable aspects of the situa-
tion is the proposal, by the rule-of-thumb
“retrenchment” party —mostly consisting, by
the way, of notorious party politicians—to
reinstate Mr. Goodghap as sole commis-
sioner, chiefly on the ground that his appoint-
ment will save two or three thousands per
annum in salary. The prospect of saving .£2OOO
or £3OOO annually, and losing possibly £lOO,OOO
or £200,000 or £300,000 through feeble and
inefficient management, is not attractive to
anybody save that kind of retrencher whose one
idea is always to get the cheapest man, no
matter what his qualifications or want of quali-
fications may be. So far, Eddy is the one
thoroughly successful railway manager Aus-
tralia has had, and the only one who seems to
know what a railway manager should be.
At a Melb. suburban police-court lately a
woman proceeded against her husband for fail-
ing to pay up the maintenance-money agreed
upon under a deed of separation. The husband
offered instead to take her back and provide
her with a home, whereupon the wife explained
that she had refused to go home because her
husband was keeping another woman in the
house, and she would not accept the position of
housekeeper to her husband and the strange
female. The crowd in the court guffawed
cheerfully just here as at something humorous.
The defendant offered no denial of the charge,
but simply demanded that his wife should
come home. Then the Bench informed the
plaintiff that it was her duty to go
home to her husband—and live at peace
with the “other woman ” apparently. It was
pointed out that the husband had agreed
to the separation, and had pledged himself to
pay a certain sum for maintenance, and that
the court was only requested to enforce the
agreement, but all the court was prepared to
say was that it was “ her duty ” to go home.
Then the case was dismissed, and the wife has,
presumably, to choose between starving and
living peaceably with the other woman afore-
said. The New Woman has evidently not
arrived yet in that Melb. suburb, and the old
woman is still looked upon by the local police
authorities as a chattel and an article of mer-
chandise. Melbourne Herald, by the way,
called it “An Amusing Case.” God help the
Herald’s ideas of amusement !
It has been carefully explained in half-a-score
of leading Tory journals that Victoria is very
lucky to get Brassey for Governor, and the
Argus and S.M. Herald laid particular stress
upon the fact that the millionaire was quite
content with the honor and glory of the job,
and wasn’t at all particular about salary in the
crooked state of the province’s finances. So
Vic. Assembly cut the pay down to £5OOO a
year, which is still about 1000 times as much as
the job is worth ; and the indignant Brassey,
who, it is explained, doesn’t care for lucre, but
has a large fund of amour propre, has imme-
diately cabled out that if the figures aren’t raised
to at least £7OOO, he probably won’t come at
all. As this would relieve Victoria of much
worry, and save money which can now ill be
spared, The Bulletin exhorts Vic. Assembly to
stick to its resolution. Then, if the enraged peer
continues to sulk, the Colonial Office can be
informed of the ghastly truth that the Governor
is of no public utility whatever, and that a
junior clerk at £l5O a year can do all that is
needed in the way of transmitting documents.
The following, from Melb. Age, deserves to b e
reproduced in all its naked innocence :
A protest by the British hatters against the Victorian
duties on hats has reached the Customs department,
through the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord
Ripon), who asks the Government to report on the mail er.
The Hat Manufacturers’ Association, representing the
British trade, has appealed to the Board of Trade, asking
that representations be made to the Victorian Govern-
ment, with a view of securing a “ rearrangement of the
tariff on a more equitable basis.” They complain of the
duty on silk hats, and particularly that on felt hats, and
quote figures up to 1892 to show that each increase in the
tariff has reduced this trade with the colony, and the last
increase has been practically prohibitive, reducing the
importations from 23,000 dozen a year to about one-third
of the quantity. It is remarked that the tariff is evidently
imposed purely for the benefit of the Victorian manufac-
turers, and not for the purposes of revenue, which was
considerably larger when the duties were less. With fur
and wool on the spot, the Australian manufacturers should
be sufficiently proteoced with 12s. or 15s. a dozen duty in-
stead of 365., but an ad valorem duty for revenue only
would be the most equitable.
J. Bull “remarks that the duty was imposed
purely for the benefit of the Victorian hat
manufacturers.” Whose benefit, in the name of
all that is wonderful, did he suppose it would

be introduced for ? And the British hatter
writes to tell Victoria that a mere revenue duty
would be “ the most equitable,” because it
would damage the local industry to such an
extefit, and wreck so much Victorian capital,
and throw so many Victorians out of work,
that there would once more be a favorable
opening for imported British hats. J. Bull’s
idea of equity is blissfully candid, ab all events,
and the spectacle of the British hatter giving
fatherly advice to a young nation is eminently
picturesque. “ Mad as a Hatter ” must be of
British origin.
A Single-Tax Community.
Certain of the agricultural districts of England
have arrived, by accident, within the last few
years, at something approaching that blissful
condition at which the Freetrade-cum-Single-tax
party aims, and the results are interesting in
more ways than one. England, so far as agri-
cultural produce is concerned, is a purely Free-
trade country, therefore one of ’the required
conditions has already been attained. In
Essex, a reasonably fertile county lying at the
very back-door of London, agriculture has
reached so low an ebb that good farms can now
be obtained rent-free, the sole consideration
being that the tenant will relieve the owner of
rates and taxes, and will cultivate the land and
prevent it relapsing into a state of utter desola-
tion. And even on these terms the land, in a
vast number of cases, cannot be let; where it
is fit only for wheat-growing purposes it cannot
be let in any case whatever. The taxes on
land, which the Essex farmer is so utterly
unable to pay, represent, perhaps, one-
third of his share of the total public and
local expenditure as it would be under the
Georgian policy; under the pure Freetrade
and Single-tax regime they would be at least
twice as heavy, and the agriculturist would
have to compete with foreign producers on
exactly the same disastrous conditions as at
present. The additional tax could not he
deducted from the landlord’s rent, as there
is absolutely no rent from which to make
deductions, therefore it must come as an addi-
tional burden on the tenant who is utterly
unable to meet his present burdens. Under
these conditions it is absolutely certain that
Single-tax-and-Freetrade would be the last
straw on the agricultural industry in England,
As a theory they are attractive in many
respects. As a reality Freetrade is disastrous
to all countries save those where wages are the
very lowest, and the Single-tax leaves the
ruinous pressure of cheap foreign competition
just where it was before. The Henry-George-
ites, who believe that a pure Single-tax system
would end all the woes of the industrial com-
munity, are hereby invited to consider the con-
dition of a class which, by a series of accidents,
has come to enjoy all the advantages, and only
half the disadvantages, of their proposed
system, and whose condition, nevertheless, is
one of general bankruptcy.
Queensland sugar output for the season just
closing is estimated at 92,000 tons—about
14,000 tons better than for ’93-4. The co-
operative mills have again done splendidly.
The small farmers rely almost equally with the
big planters on cheap colored labor, so their
gain profits the white employee almost as
little. But the joint stock mills have per-
formed good service in teaching exactly how
much it costs to make a ton of sugar—know-
ledge which the planters studiously concealed.
Hence the enormous profits of the sugar in-
dustry, in spite of low prices, can be seen ;
and advocates of “ Australia for the white
man ” are in a position to prove conclusively
that greed is the only thing which prevents
that industry from paying white men’s wages.
The veteran Saul Samuel is doubtless rubbing
his head in astonishment at the cloud which
has so suddenly risen on his peaceful horizon.
Saul is 75, but he looks likely to hang on to
New South Wales Agent-Generalship until he
is 95, unless interfered with; and Premier
Reid has given him a broad hint that
other feet are itching to fill his shoes,
and if he doesn’t gracefully retire he will
be brutally retired. It is an open secret
that G. ex-Republican Dibbs yearns to see his
friend Wales again and puff more big cigars,
and hankers badly after the billet. Premier
Reid is anxious to build a bridge of gold for the
flying enemy, reckoning that things will be
made much easier at home ; and the Reidian
organ smooths the way by pointing out Saul
Samuel’s disqualifications in a lengthy leading
article. Next, it will be proved that G. R. D.
is the only possible man for the job, and an
attempt will be made to raise the screw, to suit
his large ideas.
The Argus has broken out in a fresh place :
“ We would wish that the British Government
could see its way to provide for the payment of
colonial Governors. The cost would be little
. . . and no step probably would do more to
consolidate the Empire.” The treason of the
Argus is not often so deep. Australia does
not want England to provide the hire of her
Governors, because she does not want Gover-
nors at all, and does not care a rap about the
consolidation of the Empire. To abandon the
“privilege” of finding the Governors’ wages
whilst the monarchical spooks are foisted upon
us would be to throw over the one thing that
gives us a satisfactory feeling of bossing the
job in a sense. Certainly the Governors pro-
vided and paid by the ’Ome authorities would
be much more the puppets of ignorant and un-
wieldy Imperialism than those at present in-
flicted upon us, and any objections on the part
of Australia would be more likely to be regarded
as beastly impertinence by “ that man Rogers.”
The Argus idea is to enhance the consequence
of the regal effigies by elevating them above the
criticism of disloyal and unmannerly persons in
our Parliaments who are always mauling over
vice-royalty to see if it is worth the money.
By all means let us pay our Governors. The
less the better, but pay them.

Postmaster-General Cook, of N.S. Wales,
continues, with varying success, his efforts to
make the community moral by bursting open
and reading betting correspondence at the
Post Office. A number of the biggest and most
honest of the bookmakers are “ prohibited,”
and several dozen small, and often shady, ones
are not, therefore one result has been a mere
transference of the wicked gambling business
from one man to another. A few more have
been driven into Queensland, along with a num-
ber of “ sweep” promoters, and, P.M.G. Cook
nob being able to stop correspondence addressed
to another province, the business goes on as
prosperously as ever, the only change being a
serious loss of revenue to N.S. Wales. Mean-
while, the Post Office continues to carry the
correspondence of the obscene medical quack,
and the person who advertises for a lady to ac-
company him in an immoral capacity on a trip
to Melbourne, and the female horror who sells
mysterious compounds to ladies only, and that
Dutch firm which floods New South Wales with
obscene price-lists of obscene photographs, and
many other objectionable persons ; and the
saintly Cook hasn’t applied to Parliament for
authority to suppress any of them. This shows
a lop-sidedness and want of finish about Cook
which is aggravating to all right-thinking per-
sons. If the public morals can be improved in
any way by stopping letters ab the Post-office,
it is Mr. Cook’s obvious duty to go the com-
plete moral hog and do the work thoroughly,
and his failure in this respect is a cause of grief
in pious circles.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNES SHOWS FOR DOMINO WEEK.
Her Majesty's “The House that Jack
Built.”
Lyceum “Sowing the Wind.”
Theatre Royal “Span of Life.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR DOMINO WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “Beauty and the Beast,”

Theatre Royal “Aladdin.”
Bijou “ The Foundling.”
Last week The Bulletin regretfully men-
tioned that it didn’t know Mr. Paul Grey, whose
“ superior comedy co.” had announced a season at
Sydney School of Arts hall, and the appearance
of that gentleman only cast more obscurity upon
him. There was a smattering of people present
on the opening night, and a scanty company, only
two of whom the present writer ever heard of
before. “The most original story yet seen upon
the stage,” as the advt. put it, proved to be a
straggling, hashy thing concerning a girl who was
engaged to a baronet, and who attempted to test
his sincerity by announcing that she and her
family had suddenly lost all their money. Where-
upon the noble-hearted baronet married her, despite
her alleged poverty, and the story came to a
sudden end at half-past nine. The aud'ence was
stunned in the early part of the performance, but
later on it recovered somewhat, and amused itself
by applauding furiously and cheering the company
on to destruction. When the show came to an
untimely end it called loudly for the author, out
of a natural anxiety, no doubt, to inquire where
he got that hat, or something to the same effect;
and in response a misguided young person, who had
played the part of a flunkey, fled across the front
of the stage without stopping to explain whether
he was the author or not. He certainly looked
very like a man who might be the author of such
a piece, but this is mere theory. Most of the co.
didn’t know its part, but the audience kindly
helped it out with suggestions at critical moments,
or else cheered until the stranded one got in motion
again. After everything was over, some of the
audience even went round to the back-door and
wanted to give three cheers for the author, and
one for the noble-hearted baronet, and another for
the piece generally, but these enthusiasts un-
fortunately lost their way in the back premises of
the building.

In this issue appears an excellent portrait
of Miss Riy Jones, the leading lady of the panto-
mime “Cinderella,” at Sydney Lyceum. This
clever little woman is a native of Maoriland, and
has been a resident of Australia for six years
past. She was a pupil of Professor Ure and of
the late Madame Lucy Chambers. Her first
public appearance was at Prahran (Melbourne)
with the Philharmonic Society, when she played
the part of Selina in the cantata, “ Endymion.”
Miss Ray Jones was well-known as a singer at the
promenade concerts at Melb. Exhibition Building
in the boom days, and at many concerts held in
Melbourne Town Hall. She has also played a
long list of leading operatic parts, among them
being Germaine in “ Les Cloches de Corneville,”
Phyllis in “ lolanthe,” Gianetta in “ The Gondo-
liers,” Mabel in “The Pirates of Penzance,”
Josephine in “Pinafore” (with only three days
study), and Gretohen in “Rip Van Winkle.”
Altogether a remarkable record for so young an
artiste.

The Brough and Boucicault co. will re-
appear at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday, after a
long and painful absence. This is one of the
events which form a bright oasis in the great,
gritty desert of existence, and which are as re-
freshing as a cold tombstone on a hot-wind night.
Theco. includes all the old crowd which this com-
munity has revered in days gone by—notably
Brough, Titheradge, and Miss Grace Noble, whom
it has revered even more than the rest—and four
or five new personages engaged by Dot Boucicault
on his recent visit to the cold, damp bosom of his
mother country. The Sydney season is to last 12
weeks, and during that period it is intended to
produce half-a-dozen plays never yet seen in the
city of Parkes. “ Sowing the Wind” is announced
for the opening night, and after that come the
“New Woman,” the “Ideal Husband,” “John
A’ Dreams” (by Hadden Chambers), the “ Mas-
queraders,” and the “Case of Rebellious Susan.”
This is a powerful list, especially considering that
Australia has seen comparatively little save re-
vivals for the past year, and if the Lyceum doesn’t
have an outbreak of great prosperity, then there
is no justice left on this earth.
** * *
The “House that Jack Built” (at Her
Majesty’s) and the “Span of Life” (at Sydney
Royal) are both prospering exceedingly, and no
reports of a change of programme are heard from
either house. The same chaste and original remark
applies to the Kinetoscope exhibition, which is
still at its old address in Pitt-st., opposite the
Strand, and to “Nana,” the rather disappointing
picture of the lady in an absent bathing-costume,
which show, if The Bulletin remembers aright,
has been doing its very last week for three months
past, previous to which period it was going away
immediately. It is still doing its very last
week, and will probably continue so until further
notice.
The Sydney suburban tour of “Charley’s
Aunt ” commenced at Manly on Monday night,
as already announced, and very respectable busi-
ness was done in that eminently superior locality.
At time of writing the comedy was announced to
make its appearance at North Shore on Tuesday,
from which The Bulletin presumes that the
company successfully negotiated the boggy track
to the Spit, and succeeded in putting matters in a
favorable light to the ferryman. To-night (Thurs-
day) the show appears at Petersham, and as the
tramway arrangements are so wonderfully elabor-
ate that nobody from Petersham ever gets into
the city it ought to strike entirely new ground
thereabouts. Ashfield, a place where nothing
ever happens, except typhoid, is to be visited on
Friday; on Saturday the Aunt will make one
successive appearance at Wollongong ; and the
same estimable lady is due at Leichhardt on
Monday.
** * *
Woodloch’s Circus opened ab Redfern
(Sydney) on Thursday night to a vast audience,
and acquitted itself well. The Bulletin swore
off circuses some time ago as a species of enter-
tainment which only appeals to those who lightly
turn to thoughts of horse ; to a paper which
doesn’t yearn after horse, they are all very much
alike. Viewed from a serious and misanthropic
standpoint, however, Woodloeh’s is a remarkably
good circus. It contains nearly everything that
the writer has seen in every other circus, and as
the performers are mostly persons of much ability,
the results were all that any audience which is
fond of circuses could desire. The Bulletin’s
representative woke up frequently during the per-
formance, and every time he woke something good
was going on. The things which left a most
vivid impression on his mind were the gambling
pony, which won all its opponent’s money at
poker ; the house-breaking pony, which un-
fastened its hobbles with its teeth and then went
round and released its companions ; and the spec-
tacle of Rogers tearing round the ring on a ball
three feet in diameter, somewhat after the fashion
of Satan when he created sin by leaving his dirty
footmarks on the earth.
** * *
“ The Foundling,” which lately missed
its mark in Sydney, was played with much better
results at Melbourne Bijou on Saturday. No
company could make “The Foundling” appear
bright and original as regards dialogue and char-
acter drawing, but the present performance is for
the most part lively. Also it promised, on the
first night, to gather velocity as it went along and
achieve a passing reputation for simple naughti-
ness. This farce is at least consistent in its con-
tempt for realism. Each character in turn strikes
out an impossibly erratic line of conduct for him-
self or herself. When several lines cross one
another at a given point, they form a crazy situa-
tion, and a scene of wild disorder ensues. Upon
the spirit in which everybody rushes to a situation
and meets it when the point is reached, the laugh-
able absurdity or gloomy nonsense of “The
Foundling ” seems to depend.
« tt •
The Bijou people are sufficiently suc-
cessful, even though some of them chiefly succeed
in showing how their parts might have been
better played. Wilfrid Shine is the mitherless
bairn who stops out all night to oblige a lady, and
seeing that he has a voice in everything which
happens lie deserves much credit for keeping his
audience in good humor. All the same, Mr.
Shine is badly tailored, and much too rasping,
and a trick of dabbing: his physiognomy with a
colored handkerchief is very uncalled for. More-
over, be is slow in method as compared with,
say, Everard, the original young man of the
B. and B. company. Everard being a memory
of the past this comparison is not odious.
The Hucklebridge cad is a humorous inter-
loper in tiie important person of Elton, and
Miss Isabel Stuart, as the Tricky Maybud, is so
joyously comic at times that the extravagance of
her little ways can be forgiven. Besides, she
scores with a song and dance. John Forde and
Miss Clara Thompson will do better when they
tone themselves down. Miss Pelham and H. H.
Diver are well-placed in smaller capacities, and
the damsels, Miss Harrie Ireland and Miss Hardy,
again prove themselves a pair of well-contrasted
sunbeams. Sometimes Miss Ireland is called
upon to act, in addition to looking delicious, and
then she acts up to her appearance, which is say-
ing a good deal.
# • •
The run of “ The Foundling ” will be in-
terrupted next week, in any case. Lord Yar-
mouth has promised, under pressure, to give his
renowned entertainment at the Bijou for a season
of two consecutive nights—probably Thursday
and Friday—before he travels North. The un-
sympathetic tone of certain beastly newspapers is
not yet forgotten by the youthful earl, but in the
interests of his less fortunate fellow men he has
consented to appear again as aforesaid. For the
benefit of distressed actors and another local
charity the amiable Yarmouth will shake his legs,
and The Bulletin hopes he will derive as much
honest satisfaction from hH show as he will give
to the people who get the profits, which are likely
to be large.

“ Beauty and the Beast ” leave the
Princess’s after Saturday of this week. The ele-
gant theatre will then remain closed for six days
and renovation and cleaning, and on Saturday
(Feb. 2nd) “Cinderella” is to come along froim
Sydney.

David Cope, junr., got himself married last week to. one
of the members of the Seraphina orchestra. This was
little David’s fate from the very moment when he and
Cope ptre undertook to preside over a bevy of highly

young Australian’s heart-strings as she sat modestly
squeezing her British concertina. Heigho !
It is now said, in all seriousness, that a recently-married
actress intends to sue for a divorce, on the ground of her
husband’s delicate health, or something to that effect.
The story doesn’t sound very true. But evidence that they
have ceased to form a united family is strong enough to
warrant the purfesh’s belief in a case to come.
Mary Anderson (Mdme. de Navarro) must look back
with regret upon the days when she thought she had
become “wedded to her art’’ and would never commit
bigamy by accepting a flesh-andblood hubby. Marriage,,
from the start, has been a failure, physically speaking,.
with beautiful Mary. At latest dates she lay dangerously
ill at her London residence, where she gave birth to a i
baby which lived only a few hours. For the past three or
four years, says an English paper, this once-envied actress <
has been a great sufferer.
A mediocre concert-singer was asked in Adelaide to’

other prominent actors are going to take part.” “ Pooh,,

Luscombe Searelle is alleged to have said at the recent'
London dinner at the Anglo-African Writers’ Club, that

Bulletin. Mr. Searelle may have heen on the Stockwhip, .
but, so far as is known in The I’ulletin office, he was never
in any way connected with this paper, save to the extent
of having once threatened it with a libel-action. More-
over, the Stockwhip didn’t become The Bulletin -which
has never been mixed up in any way with any other
paper. The Bulletin, fortunately, had no parents ; itt
simply “ growed.”

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

The Melbourne Age now endorses the idea
which The Butletin advanced many months ago, and has
been advancing ever since, that the State should come to
the assistance of the reconstructed banks for a fair con-
sideration. It points out that the British Government
once issued *5,000,000 in State paper-money to assist a
crisis, ami made a profit out of the transaction, and that
the plan “ proved an enormous success.” Also, the
British Government has over and over again authorised
the Bank of England to pour out an almost unlimited
note supply foe the same purpose. “We are confronted
with the fact,” says the Age, “that between the years
1897 and 1901 the Australian reconstructed banks have to
meet demands amounting to £44,000,000,” and the fact
that they can’t settle the bill without State assistance is
tolerably obvious. But if there is to be State assistance
there should also be State supervision, and if the State ia
to give its valuable security then there should be a
reduction of interest, for State paper at 3 per cent, is
quite as good as hank paper at 4J, and 4J with a national
guarantee is simple extortion.

The Commercial Bank of Australia’s balance-
sheet looks better in some respects than its predecessor,
and is probably about as good as any that the big bank
has produced since it started out in its own peculiarly
disastrous fashion to “restore confidence.” There is very
little to choose between it and the last one, and what
difference exists is partly for the belter and partly other-
wise. With £135,000 more capital the bank contrived to
earn just £62 more gross profit in the half-year, but by
hard economy expenses were so far reduced that the net
profit is £13,350, against £7900 for the previous six
months. The cash on hand has diminished by £300,000,
and now stands at £816,000; the note circulation has
increased a little, and the new deposits and current
accounts—which are, in a great degree, the measure of
public confidence—have dropped badly, from £1,772,000
to £1.492,000. The directors report that they have
“practically” paid off deposits falling due in 1898 to
the amount of £soo,ooo—not In cash, but by accept-
ing deposit-receipts in satisfaction of debts “ other-
wise doubtful,” from which it appears that the
C* mmercial of Australia only accepts its own securi-
tiis in settlement when it is dead sure that it can’t
get cash. There is no div., and the board has given up
the hollow pretence of apologising for its absence, which
is one good feature in the case, for the Commercial needs
to swear-off all divs. for five years, anyhow. As the whole
profits would only pay 15s. per cent, all round, the
advisability of saying nothing on this painful subject is
sufficiently apparent. The £53,000 which was fooled
away a year ago to keep up the pretence of paying a div.
on preference shares was the worst mistake this bank
ever made. Nothing is said, either, about releasing any
of the old fixed deposits, and no serious progress seems to
be made so far towards providing for the great mass of
liabilities which fall due in ’9B, ’99, and 1900. The interest
payable on deposits for the half-year is £17,000 less than
it was a year ago, but this relief produces no visible effect
on the profits. Also, the liquidation of the old bank gets
on rather slowly, there being still six-and-a-half millions
of its nominal assets which the new bank hasn’t taken
over because of their (at present) unsatisfactory condi-
tion. On the whole, things look, we are glad to see, a
little better than they did, but it is too soon to indulge in
any pleasant prophecies about Gyles Turner’s unwieldy
institution.

The A. J.S. Bank proposes to pay off during the
current half-year one-half of that instalment of the recon-
structed deposits which falls due in June, ’97, on condi-
tion that the depositors grant a renewal of the other half
until 1902. In other words, it proposes to pay one-half
two years in advance on condition that the other half is
postponed for five years-which is equivalent to asking 18
months’ more time on the whole amount.
This either means that the A. J.S. is in rather a
oad way, or that it has a brainy set of directors who see
further ahead than most of their kind. In the first
instance it would simply mean that the bank couldn’t
meet the first batch of its engagements without further
concessions from its creditors, and nothing more, in which
case it might seem that the prospects of the other nine
instalments were none too bright. On the other hand, it
is already an admitted fact that very few of the recon-
structed banks can meet the immense mass of liabilities
falling due in ’9B, ’99, 1900 and 1901, and many of them,
when their heavy payments fall due, must ask for an ex-
tension. Therefore, it may be that the A.J.C. directors,
being far-sighted men, propose to pay a large proportion
of each instalment long before it falls due, as a reasonable
equivalent for an extension of the other half.
If this latter is the case the action is a wise one,
as they will certainly get better terms than those institu-
tions which have to ask for concessions at the last
moment without anything to offer in return. Every-
thing depends on whether the present move is part of a
well-ordered system, or merely a device to stave off the
first difficulty without any consideration for what lies
beyond, and as no independent authority can give a
definite answer to this question no reliable inference can
be drawn. A State audit would throw some light on the
matter, but nothing else seems likely to do so.

The Q.N. Bank brags that it has reduced its
tremendous debt to Q. Govt, by £1,163,650 since the 1893
collapse. But what has become of tins £1,163,650 ? Has
not the Govt, immediately handed all of it and a lot more
public money to the bank to take care of? If so, many
people would stigmatise the transaction as a mere piece of
ledger jugglery. For the hard fact is thatwhile the bank’s
indebtedness to the Govt, is being decreased, the
Govt, deposits in the bank are being steadily increased.
When the bank stopped payment, in May, 1893, it had
£2,442,000 of Govt, moneys in custody. On Dec. 31,
1894, the amount was increased to £3,600,000, including
£242,000 worth of Treasury notes. Thus the bank has
paid the Govt. £1,163,650, and the Govt, has handed
back to the bank about £2,321,000 ; and the bank is
just about £1,160,000 cash in pocket. So far, the re-
payments of the bank appear to have consisted in waiting
till the Government pays a sum of money into general
account, and then transferring part of it to the recon-
struction account and taking immense credit for present-
ing the province with a little of its own money. Mean-
while, the bank has charge of the money, or of the figures
which represent it, all the time, and “ gets there” with
the same old regularity.

The Bank of Victoria goes on the even foolish-
ness of its way as heretofore. For the half-year ending
31st Dec., ’93, it made a net profit of £31,600, and
“blewed” it all save £4OOO in paying a 5 per cent. div. to
preference and ordinary shareholders alike. For half-year
ending June, '94, it made a profit of £30,000, and spent it
all but £l6OO in the same fashion. Last half-year it earned
only £21,000, and spends it all but £6OO in paying 5 per
per cent, to preference and 2J per cent, to ordinary share-
holders. The profits are large considering ail the adverse
circumstances, and, if due allowances have been made for
possible losses, are evidence of fhe real soundness of the
bank ; but still these profits are obviously declining, and
the showy div. of last year can’t be kept up, and, in
any esse, a reconstructed institution with no reserve-
fund, a huge liability coming due in a very few years, its
pref rence shares at nearly 50 per cent, discount, and its
ordinary shares unsaleable, has no right to spend more
than half its profits at the most, in divs. The available
cash (£1,500,000) shows a substantial increase, and why
this enormous am unt of coin is kept on hand without
some attempt being made to release the first batch of
reconstructed deposits (due in June, 1898), and thus
reduce the htavy interest charge, passes comprehension.
The amount on hand is equal to all the possible immediate
liabilities twice over, and the fund is not only earning no
interest, but half of it is absolutely useless,

The Bmk of Western Australia has declared a

In one reconstructed bank only one director is
a preference shareholder. All the others, while assuring

most oases, a director is either a preference shareholder or
a first-class liar.

As already intimated, the Balmain (Sydney) old
Steam Ferry Co. has decided to voluntarily wind up
under court inspection. The resolution to this effect will
be confirmed on 30th inst., after which date, it is under-
stood, the co. will cease operations. The directors’ report
is a most melancholy document; but it should be remem-
bered that they only took charge when the late directors
no longer possessed the confidence of the shareholders on
account of their obstinate blindness in failing to see the
trend of opinion among (he co.’s customers generally.
The losses for '93 and ’94 were £4049 10s. 2d. and
£4865 7s.—total, £8914 17s. 2d., or a net loss, after
deducting the '92 credit balance, of £6205 15s. Id.
The paid-up capital is £29,250, and liabilities such ns
debentures, deposits, and creditors come to £15,333
19s. 3d. Against this total of £44,583 19s. 3d., the co.’s
steamers are valued at £28,000 (apparently far too high),
whilst its other properties and sundry debtors bring its
complete assets to £38,378 4s. 2d. However, allowing for
depreciation, and granted can ful nursing of assets with
judicious liquidation, the co. ought to manage without
calL, and may, with luck in the sale of stermers and free-
hold, pay a few shillings in the pound to the unfortunate

For years past Maoriland’s exports have ex-
ceeded her imports to a greater extent than those of any
other province except Queensland. Here are the figures:
1888 excess of exports £2,911,355
1889 „ „ 3,955,714
1890 „ „ 3,480,581
1891 „ „ 2,521,310
1892 „ „ 2,628,839
1893 „ „ 2,667,206
It is estimated that Maoriland should export to the value
of £3,330,000 per annum more than she imports, in order
to meet her liabilities to outside creditors and absentees.
■Therefore, during six years in which she has been the one
bright example of economy in Australasia, she only
twice managed to meet her liabilities out of her own
resources. As an essay on the general hopelessness of
things this is worth thinking over.

with those securities and bills attached to another party
who must be paid, as “ he is without the bowels of com-

imputation, and brother Alick(not In the Ministry), while

to know the extent of brother “ Aliok’s” interest on the

W. A. Mercer, of Bewick, Moreing & Co., a
fashionable London firm of mining engineers whose name
is seen on every W.A, prospectus in the Big Smoke, has
come to Sydney, apparently to push the Coolgardie boom
along. He starts with: “There is a great future before
Coolgardie.” Amongst other things, he proposes to build
a 1000-head battery on the Swan and run a number of
subsidiary railways to feed the battery with ore from the
Coolgardie fields, some 300 miles away. This was con-
tractor Millar’s idea, so Mercer has merely revived a
scheme which will never be carried out. It is cheaper to
talk of a 1000 - head stamp mill than it is to
put up one of 10 heads. Mr. Mercer admits
that the mines are undeveloped; hence it is too soon
for the erection of great stamp mills. He also talks of
the difficulty of salt-water in amalgamation and of the
necessity of a thorough system of recovering gold from
the ore. The great want is more gold— there is no trouble
about saving it. In 99 cases out of 100 the gold is rough
or absent. Some months ago Moreing, of Bewick, More-
ing and Co., was reported to have declared, and repeated
in London, that there were 2ft. retfs at Coolgardie half
solid gold ; and this junk of heavy boom talk has since
been reprinted on a dozen Coolgardie prospectuses. Per-
haps Mr. Mercer can-explain how his friend came by that

3oz. Well, the writer has seen it, and happens to know
that it has been condemned by several people because it
does not promise loz. average. Of the Croesus, the
S.M.H. man says it will go 4oz. (shareholders expect 10),
and, of Lake View, that the crushing then commenced
would go 6 to 9oz. It went a little over 2oz. ! He says of
the Golden Eagle (White Feather): “This is another
very rich property.” It is not thought so locally. “The
Nrraesis was sold for £3OOO and l-6th, hut if the bargain
was made after a certain shot was fired the price would

Hitherto it has been supposed that only £12,000
gold has been taken from the alleged Wealth of Nations
mine. A recent interview with prospector Dunn gives
another version. “ The first camel’s load I took in con-
sisted of about £B5OO worth of quartz gold, and the second
£13,000. The total value of the stuff brought in was
£22.000, and it includ'd one stone which weighed 1591 h.,
and contained about S00"z. of gold. We have npf ned the
lode up in three different places for a length of 12 chains
along the outcrop. One of the shafts is now down at 83ft.,
showing a well-defined lode 9ft. thick from wall to wall,
and carrying splendid gold all through. All the author-
ities w ho have examined the ground agree that the Wealth
of Nations is one of the best-defined lodes in Australia,
and the geological features are very favorable for a con-
tinuance of it to—any depth. It is schistose and diorilio
rock, striking north and south, and underlying west.”
Then Mr. Dunn went on to talk about the, “very good
property which he called the Brilliant” and sold to the
Messrs. Millar. Mr. Dunn apparently forgot to say what
happened to the Brilliant.

Efforts are being made to again start Parker’s
United, Gordons (Vio.), over which many thousands have
been spent, many fortunes made and lost—the two
opposite results being due to the fact that the stock has
for the past ten years been a Ballarat Exchange gamble.
For instance, a week before the old co. was sold up by
the London bank were run from 4d. to Is. 4d.,
and this sort of thing always occurred when the bulls and
bears had little to do. One of the weaknesses of
Parker’s lay in the weekly reports, which were con-
sistent in that each week saw a flat denial of that of the
preceding one. For three years, according to these
reports, the co. has only been 50 feet off gold, and this is
the main argument in the new prospectus. Strange to

There are versions of the wherefore of the
appointment of Mr. Alex. Stewart to the assistant-general
managership of the Proprietary which do not agree with
the directorial pronouncement. One of these connects
director Knox with -’a precipitate appointment to
the Mt. Lyell managership, ratification of which was pre-
vented by the subsequent obstinate refusal of that show
to boom. Color is lent to the story by the practical cer-
tainty that had the Mt. Lyell borm not jibbed at the
critical point, Mr. Stewart, as manager of the Tharsis
(Spain), would have got the billet. But Mt. Lyell may
boom heavily yet.

tons for 4540 z. at £3 4s. 9d. per ounce. Proportionate
expenses, however, are somewhat heavy—battery at

stuff enough in sight to give two years’ work at least.

Mr. A. E, Barnes, Albury-street, Murrumburrah,
N.S.W., who writes on June 13th, 1893 I have
been subjected to indigestion for over twelve
months. Symptoms were headaches, w r ant of appe-
tite, a drowsy feeling, especially a few hours after
meals, and a heavy feeling on the chest, also a
want of energy. Hearing so much of Clements
Tonic as an invigorator and nerve strengthener, I
tried it, and am happy to say that in a very short
time all disagreeable symptoms vanished as if by
magic. I have never had a recurrence of the old
disagreeable feelings since. I am only too happy
to send tin's short testimony as to the great cura-
tive properties of Clements Tonic. Not alone
have I been benefited myself by the use of Clem-
ents Tonic, but a number of my friends have been
using it for some time with life great st success.
I recommend Clements Tonic <>n all occasions.—I
remain, yours truly, A. E. Barnes, storekeeper,

Henry Thom, of the N.S.W. Public Works
Department, aged 25 years, who, with J. M. Folk-
hard, was last Sunday drowned at Narrabeen,
near Sydney, while bathing, was a grandson of
ex-Premier Parkes.
Among reporters Premier Turner is the
most popular Minister who has held office for
many years in Victoria. His orders are that the
pressmen are to see him first, no matter how many
M.’aP. are waiting.
The scowling ex-Premier Patterson keeps
—or rather used to keep, for they were all stolen
the other day—canaries ! History repeats itself.
Couthon doted on a pet spaniel in the Reign of
Terror, and Marat kept doves.
F. W. Ward, editor of Brisbane Courier
and Observer, rather likes simultaneous occu-
pancy of a pair of chairs. When in Sydney, he
edited simultaneously the Mail and Echo, and
for a time the Daily Telegraph and Tribune,
and at both periods often complained that he
hadn’t enough to do.
The death of the “Hon, Went-
worth 0 a venagh-Main waring,” of
“ Whitby Hall, Staffordshire,” is cabled.
Formerly he was plain W. Cavenagh,
and was a land-agent in Adelaide, but his
wife succeeded to the Mainwaring estate,
worth about =O5OOO a year, owing to her
four brothers dying without issue.
Cavanagh was a mediocre person, and
at one time sat in S.A. Assembly and
was Commissioner of Crown Lands. The
present heir to the estate, J. G. Main-
waring, is an Adelaide solicitor, and
awhile ago made a sensation by contest-
ing Yatala for S.A. Assembly as the son
of his father, polling about 30 votes.
I was reminded of the flight of time
(writes an Australian in England to This
Bulletin) by seeing the other day two of
the sons of the late W. B. Dailey, one of
whom is studying for the Bar, and the
other coaching for the army. They are
rather small in stature, but possess some
of the “ ginger ” for which their father
was noted in his early career. They are
dare-devil horsemen and good drivers,
and were lately summoned for furious
riding in the Park ; but with W. B, D.’s
plausibility they managed to get off with
a caution—the policeman having des-
cribed them as “ nice, civil-spoken young
gentlemen.”
Grainger, M.P. |(S.A.), tells this
story against himself. When a young
man he had long flowing curls and
thought himself an Adonis. He was
bathing in the Thames one day when he
suddenly caught the sound of feminine
laughter. Ashe was in shallow water, he
rapidly bent down so that only an eye,
a nostril, and some ringlets were above
the surface. A boat, in which sat two ladies
and two gentlemen, drifted lazily past, and one
fair damsel, pointing to his floating curls, cried
out: “Oh, look at the nasty dead puppy. Pull
away quick!”
M‘llwraith has lost flesh and grown a
beard, and, save for silver streaks and his evident
great debility, looks the M'llwraith of the

Dr. Marshall McCarthy, it is cabled, has
passed the examination for F.R.C.S., Edin. The
doctor will be remembered as the benevolent and
self-denying young man who, in years gone by,
did so much for the Sydney newsboys.
That fine old salt, Capt. Wm. Stuart, who,
when in command of the old liner Tweed, had
in his charge so many wives and prospective
wives en route to Australia, died at sea on Sept.
20, while captain of the ship Loch Etive.
Who is “the dearest, most charming man”
amongst N.S.W. politicians—the man who is
“ nicest to the ladies?” Well, that is the gentle-
man chiefly responsible for dead-heading all those
“distinguished” ladies over the State-railway
lines.
Bishop Cowie, of Auckland, has appointed
his son to be his chaplain, and, of course, to be
paid out of the diocesan fund. It thus appears
that a father’s heart beats as strongly in the
bosom of a bishop as in those of the son-associate
judges of Australasia.
A correspondent tells The Bulletin that
a brother of Adam Lindsay Gordon (who proved
by papers his relationship to the poet), died a few
days ago in a Riverina hospital (under an alias).
But had A.L.G. a brother? Till now, we had
only heard of his sister.
The good old sectarian cry had at least a
Pule to do with the prominence given the Tich-
borne case. The Tiohbornes were an old R.O.
family, and Exeter Hall and Little Bethel were
more or less behind the Claimant. The friends
who believed in him to the last, such as Whalley,
Newdigate, & Co., were among the most bigoted
men in English public life.
Said Captain Milner, late aide-de-camp to
Lord Kintore ; “It’s deuoedly unpleasant, you
know, to be at the beck and call of the Governor,
whoever he may be. But really, you _ know, I
couldn’t stand that fussy Mr. Way again.” So,
although he acted during Lord Kintore’s recent
flying visit to England, he now accompanies the
Earl back to the land of snow and fog.
Mills, the actual finder of the London-
derry mine, makes out of his strike just on
£70,000, of which he has already got at least
£50,000 in good red gold. One of the first things
he did after his return to the East was to marry
the woman of his choice, a little Victorian country
girl, to whom he became engaged long before he
hung his hat on those memorable knobs of gold.
The rumor that N.S.W, Railway-Com-

mail, has just succeeded in kindling the ashes of
one of the oldest Bohemian clubs in London, the
“Vagabonds.” The first dinner under the new
regime was held last week, and brought together
a most wonderful array of novelists, artists and
journalists. F. W. Robinson was the chairman,
and Frankfort Moore the honored guest of the
evening. Ho made a most chirpy speech. Amongst
other things he defined a novelist as being “ a man
who tried to live by writing books that won’t.”
The pocket chronometer worn by Nelson
at the battle of Trafalgar is said now to belong to
Mr. Redmond, of Sydney, who claims blood-
relationship with the celebrated Admiral. It is
open-faced, with a silver-gilt case, and about twice
the size of the ordinary modern watch. The inner
works —cog-wheels, plates, &c. —are of brass,
heavily gilded, and, with the exception of the
main-spring (a quarter-inch broad), the works are
well preserved. Its maker is Arnold, of London,
and, great as is its age, and although it has not
gone for 21 years, a scientific amateur, a friend of
its owner, very easily succeeded in making it
again keep time.
FREETRADE MURRAY SMITH.
The forlorn hope of a [?] cause.
Mistah Pursey Chirnside delivered his
maiden speech in Vic. Assembly, on Wednesday
night week. He was beautifully arrayed for the
occasion, and had quite an array of pretty women
—including the divinely-fair Mrs. Percy—in the
gallery to hear the oration. The subject was the
reduction of the municipal subsidy. Specimen :
“ In mai constituency there is a great twaffic on
the—ah—er—woads, end if this wetwenchment—
er—is cawwied out—ah—we shall not be able to
wepair the woads, and that will be a dweadful—
er—state of things.” Pursey has a thin, gentle,
claret-and-lemonade voice, and a parliamentary
manner suggestive of an imminent intention to
ask the Premier if he may have the pleashah of the
—ah—next darnse.
Ivo Bligh, the captain of the English
cricket-team which visited Australia ten years
back, had a unique experience on his wedding-
night. He and his handsome bride, Miss Florrie
Morphy, went to a picturesque cottage on the side
of Mt. Macedon for their honeymoon, and, after
dinner, Ivo strolled out into the bush for a cigar.
His smoke finished, he started back, but, after
half-an-hour or so of an endless procession of gum-
trees, he was forced into admitting that he was
lost. He then made desperate endeavors to find
his way back, but only got further and further
into the bush. He had no matches to light a fire,
and all his hollering for help failed to bring assis-
tance. The upshot was that he had to sleep in the
scrub like a big babe in the wood, until the morn-
ing light enabled him to locate his residence, and
join his disconsolate and weeping bride.
The late ex-N.S. W. Chief Justice Alfred
Stephen, whose will has been probated for .£15,630,
was, like Parkes and Barton, very fond of the
phrase “For I am a poor man.” Journalist
Harold Stephen, who when he had thirty shillings
in his pocket felt as well as the Mikado, once
wrote to his uncle in reprobation of this habit.
“If you are poor,” wrote Harold, “keep it to
yourself. Hide it all you can. If I let the world
know exactly how I stand, I’d get nothing and be
despised besides. And, whatever you may say
about your own poverty, I beg you, when talking
to Ministers of the Crown about me, not to say I
am poor. The first thing asked when a man enters
Parliament is : ‘ Has he much stuff ?’ If they
think he has, Ministers and fellow-members go
out of their way to serve him ; if he hasn’t, they
leave him alone.” Alas, these were the days of
non-payment of members.
Mr. George Mayo, F.R.0.5., who died in
Adelaide the week before Christmas, had watched
the progress of South Australia almost from its
establishment. He was born at Seend, in Wilt-
shire, on January Bth, 1807; became a member
of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1829; and
reached Adelaide in the Lady Emma in 1837, a
year after Colonel Light and the first surveyors
arrived there. He returned to England, but finally
settled in the province in 1839; living and
dying on one of the original town acres. Mr.
Mayo did some volunteering in his middle life, and
retired as Lieutenant-Colonel from the command
of the Adelaide regiment in 1865. He took to
bicycling with enthusiasm; but when he reached
80, he added a third wheel, and, within a year of
his death, negotiated a 12-mile ride before break-
fast on the tricycle. A sturdy, sensible, old
fellow ; a quiet, peaceful, useful life.
The very latest N.S. W. land-resumption

Felix Faure, the new French President,
seems to be a moderate man whom nobody very
much likes and nobody very much dislikes—which
ia the recommendation of a weak character rather
than of a strong one. He is the third 1 rench
President in seven months.
The young N.S.W. barrister, J. de Lacy
O’Reilly, who recently died at the early age of 28,
was, some time ago, a frequent and esteemed con-
tributor to The Bulletin over the pen-name
of “A. C. Fontaine.” He was formerly a pupil-
teacher in a N.S. W. State-school, and from that
humble position he qualified for the bar by his
own unaided efforts, and was admitted to practise
only one month before his lamented decease.
The official documents forwarded to the
Swedish consuls in Australia by last mail from
Stockholm show that little Norway with its two
millions of people would welcome a row. Nor-
way and Sweden are the typical examples of
Home Rule, each country having a Parliament,
but both Parliaments being under one king. But
even there the demon of discord appears to be
getting in his work. The animosity revealed in
the instructions lately received (which, indeed,
though emanating from the Swedish throne, were
written in French) looks, at this end, to have a
very small base, the consuls being simply informed
that their official title is “ Consul of Sweden and
Norway,” and that when Norwegian authorities
write to them as “Consuls of Norway and
Sweden,” they are to manifest their allegiance by
eturning the letters unread to Norway.
It is stated that a Chinese Hill End
(N.S.W.) doctor has successfully treated a case of
mouth-cancer. “Some months ago, an enginedriver,
after having a tooth drawn, developed a cancerous
growth which ultimately destroyed his palate and
spread over the right side of his face. He was
treated by medical men both locally and in
Bathurst, without receiving relief, and was admit-
ted into the Alfred Hospital, Sydney, in October.
He suffered terrible agony, and as nothing could
be done to help him, he was advised to return to
Hill End. There the Chinese doctor visited him
and applied a poultice to his face. Thereafter he
suffered no pain, a hard core has come away
through the roof of the mouth, and now the flesh
on the inside of the mouth seems to be healing,
and the flesh on the face looks healthier. The
patient eats heartily, though with difficulty, and
keeps in good spirits. He has of late taken a
short walk daily, and is so rapidly gaining
strength that he hopes co be at work before the
end of the month.” It will be interesting to note
the future history of this case. The Alfred Hos-
pital authorities say that the poor man was un-
doubtedly suffering from cancer —and add that if
he lives two years they are prepared to make
obeisance to the Chinaman.

GALLAWAY, the N.S.W. Cricketer .
Ed. Bulletin, —The correspondent who
refers to “ The Song of Father Duchesne ” quotes
some lines of a song which he heard in Tasmania
years ago. The lines he quotes are from the old-
time song of ‘‘John Hall, Chimney-Sweep,” which
details the sayings and doings of one John Hall,
condemned to death in the days of Jonathan
Wild. It is generally supposed to be the song
which gave such offence to Colonel Newoome (in

“MAN WANTS BUT LITTLE, NOR THAT

It was the above clever saying of Edward Young,
which brought about the conception of Erossard’s
Ca vour Cigars. It is indeed better to have a small
and good cigar—the packet of eight is sold for one
shilling—to enjoy its mild aromatic smoke, and
have done with it, than to puff away at a thing
like a telegraph pole, where you have quantity
instead of quality, and pay three or four times as
much.

In 1881, for every 10,000 native-born
Victorians of the age of 21 and upwards, 550 were
arrested. In 1891 the proportion was reduced to
39(5 for each 10,000. Hayter should not be allowed

be allowed to state facts that bring down con-

Reid, the softgoodsman, made the best
sp ech delivered in Vic. Upper House against the
land-tax during the recent debate. The fact that
it was the best is interesting as showing how

connected whoop about the greatness and glory of
England, with a peroration concerning the Union
Jack.
The Eddy (N.S.W. Chief Railway Com-
missioner) resignation evolves the following
alternatives : (1) Double Eddy’s screw and keep
him. (2) Let him go and appoint Oliver. (3) Let
him go and appoint Fehon. (4) Let him go and
appoint Goodchap. (5) Let all of them go and
appoint Goodchap. As the country will, if Good-
chap be appointed, be able to squash his pension
(*B6O a year) agreement this last solution awakes
a host of eager supporters. The N.S.W. railways
and tramways cost =£36,000,000, and what the
country appears to be most ly worried about is how
to get the cheapest possible man to muddle this
gigantic property into chaos.

The grim and grisly Patterson has been of
late so agreeable to the Turner Government that
people would like to know what billet the ex-
butcher is after, or what mischief he is concocting.

Some people are urging Patterson’s claims to

Can it really be true that N.S.W. Works
Minister Young lias been guilty of the gross in-
decency of retaining his own son in a permanent
position in his department while dismissing many
married men longer in the service ? If it is true,
then the merits of Mr. Young’s son are quite
beside the question, for no man can be a com-
petent judge in his son’s cause.
Ministers of the Crown have practically
carte blanche for travelling expenses when away
from the metropolis, and with some past minis-
terial excursions in mind it will be worth while to
ask the amount of N.S.W. Minister Garrard’s
bill when he returns from Maoriland. The infor-
mation he seeks could have been collected under a
shilling’s-worth of postage-stamps.
The Govt, arrangement with Chief-Justice
Way is that he is to act as Governor for .£5OOO a
year (the salary drawn by Lord Kintorejand fore-

Australians think that they have now seen the
last of the imported vicegerents. Adding together
his different spells of office, Way has now
“ Governed ” South Australia for over two years.
Moral ?
Those members of Vic. Assembly who
loyally opposed the reduction of Governors’
salaries, because the community would suffer “in
consequence of the diminished circulation of
wealth,” were all eager enemies of the minimum-
wage, and delighted in brandishing the knife that
cut down the seven-bob a-day State servants. The
circulation of wealth is a splendid thing—when
I atman is made the circulating medium.
Some weeks ago the owners of the Zig-Zag
colliery, Lithgow (N.S.W.), issued an order to
their men to work on Sunday. Eighteen of them
did so, and were promptly charged with breaking
the good old Sabbath of Charles 11. If they had
refused to work they would possibly have been
“ sacked.” As they did work they were fined.
The owners who compelled them to break the law
weren’t lined—in fact, they weren’t even sum-
moned.
Compare Australian and French judicial
salaries. The President of the Court of Cassation,
the head of the French judiciary, receives 30,000
francs (£l2OO a year), the remuneration of the
other Judges of the Court varying, according to
rank, from £lOOO to £720. The President of the
Court of Appeal receives £lOOO a year, and the
other members from £550 to £440. Appeal
Judges in the provinces, £2OO. Magistrates in
Paris receive £320, and in the country from £2OO
to £72 per annum.
Payment of Members, in Victoria, was
precipitated by the Quieting of Titles Bill. This
measure secured a lot of shaky squatting titles to
land. A heap of members were bribed, as was
shown before a committee. One member, accused of
being instrumental as briber, was expelled; another
cautioned by Mr. Speaker. Three squatting
agents were put in gaol by Parliament, and
liberated by the Judges; but the Privy Council,
on appeal, upheld Parliament. Nevertheless, the
offenders were not again “lumbered.”
“Timotheus ” (Argus) gives the following
Ministry as the probable outcome of the alleged
alliance of labor and legal members in Vic.
Assembly :
Premier and Treasurer .. Shiels.
Attorney-General .. ... Higgins.
Lands .. .. .. Longmore.
Chief Secretary .. .. Trenwith.
Customs .. -.. .. Hancock.
Mines .. .. .. Prendergast.
Victoria has had worse Ministries. But when the
Radical Ministry comes it will include Deakin
and Trenwith ; possibly Higgins and probably
George Turner.
Labor-member Hancock suspects, with
good reason, that Victoria will get very little pro-
gressive legislation from a Premier who represents
a “Fat” constituency in Parliament. George
Turner, fighting on the winning side in each
instance, has had only a 10 per cent, majority at
St. Kilda poll when opposed by second-rate Tory
novices, and at last election he dared not breathe

word land-tax at bis meetings. If be honestly
desires to be a Radical, Turner must find another
seat; indeed, he is already doomed to “ get the
run ” from St. Kilda, and it is a ghastly fact in
Victorian politics that the best of men, being
rejected at one place, couldn’t find a member for
any other place ready to vacate his seat for the
sake of the cause.
Sydney Daily Telegraph, arguing for
reductions in the salaries of Australian Governors,
seeks to efface the word salary altogether, and
makes it appear that the allowances of the past
and present were voted merely to meet incidental
expenses. _ Why is it that professing democrats
are so anxious to call by some other name what is
truly salary or wages ? When the bill for payment
of members was brought into the N.S.W. House,
one Radical after another declared the sum set
down was not to be considered payment for par-
liamentary services, but a sum towards meeting
expenses incurred, and the Act still carries some
such roundabout caption. The State should know
only a man’s work or his needs. If he needs, it is
his helper ; if he works, it owes him wages ; if he
neither needs nor works, it doesn’t notice him.
Workers, professionals, capitalists, land-
owners, and middlemen are thus represented in
Vie. Leg. Assembly :
One baker, one japanner, one butcher, two printers,
one sawmiller, one gardener, one paper-ruler, one boot-
maker, one miner, one engineer, one miller, one con-
tractor, eight graziers, seven farmers, one physician, two
surgeons, four merchants, two diapers, one bookseller,
one surveyor, three storekeepers, one arbitrator, three
licensed victuallers, two journalists, 13 lawyers, seven
agents, nine auctioneers, and 16 nondescripts who prefer
to leave their occupations unstated.
The actual workers number about a dozen-and-a-
half. The rest are capitalists, lawyers, and go-
betweens generally. It is the Labor-party alone

I've had to keep it down by narnin'[?] it off—same as they

that keeps Parliament from being a mere Assembly
of auctioneers, agents, lawyers, and “gentlemen.”
“ Steele Grey ” writes thus ;
Dear Bulletin,— When, a few weeks back, I sum-
marised in your columns the present state of knowledge
in re a possible antidote for snake-poison, I had no desire
to raise the wrath of the apostle of the strychnine treat-
ment. As, however, Dr. Mueller has chosen to attack me
in Tub Bulletin, and to become offensively personal, I
claim the right to reply. (I) Does snake-poison act upon
the blood only, on the nervous system only, or on both ?
Dr. Mueller says: “It is no blood-poison at all," by
which, I presume, he means that it acts on the nervous
system only. But, amongst other observers, Weir-
Mitchell, Reichert, and Brainard, in America, Fayrer, in
India, Halford, in Melbourne, and Martin, in Sydney, all
note that in most fatal oases of snakebite the blood
remains fluid after death instead of coagulating. Does
not this point to a chemical change in the blood due to
the venom ? Also, Dr. George Harley, of London, after a
post-mortem on a dog bitten by an African puff-
adder, says, “everything pointed to blood-poisonin.'.”
Dr. Martin, of Sydney, likewise remarks, “some of the
haemoglobin is dissolved in the plasma.” Moreover,
Dr. Mueller himself (on Snake-Poison, p. 23) states that
the blood becomes surcharged with carbonic acid, loses
its haemoglobin, and is thin and dark after death. All
this evidence proves that snake-poison does act on the
blood. (2) That snake-poison affects the nerve centres is
also perfectly true, but, to use the words of J. Arthur
Thomson, of Edinburgh, “snake-poison acts through the
circulation on the nerve centres, and also affects the
blood itself." (3) Dr. Mueller derisively queries, “ Who
ever heard of snake-poison, when injected into the blood-
stream, causing blood-clots to form, that fill up the cham-
bers of the heart?” Well, I, for one, have seen intravas-
cular clotting ; but, since Dr. Mueller maj' think ray
evidence worthless, I will quote others. Brainard, in 1854,
wrote: “ Wtien death occurred immediately in animals
bitten by rattlesnakes, the blood was found at the post-
mortem. examination to be clotted.” This was confirmed
by Weir-Mitchell in 1860. Here also are a few sentences
from a paper by Dr. Martin, of Sydney University, in vol.
XV. of the Journal of Physiology, on the effects of poison
of the Australian black snake: —“ In my previous experi-
ence with rats, rabbits, guineapigs, and dogs, the blood
post mortem was always coagulated. . . Immediately
after the introduction of the venom, coagulability in-
creases, and culminates in intravascular clotting of
greater or less extent. . . Intravascular clothing is
produced most readily if the dose be rapidly thrown into
a vein near the heart . . . the blood in the left ven-
tricle and aorta being solid. . . The moment of clot-
ting in the arteries is indicated on the tracing by the dis-
appearance of the heart-beats. . . The same dose [of
tissue-fibrinogen] given to an animal in full digestion pro-
duced clotting extending to the general venous system,
the right heart, and even into the arteries: I have shown
reason for believing that the blood of animals in full
digestion exhibits the same increased sensitiveness to
the venom.” All of which means that snake poison
can produce dotting in the venous system and
heart, thereby producing heart-stoppage. (A) All the
above evidence justifies my contentions— (a) that snake-
poison may kill by stoppage of the heart's action either
by paralysis of the nerve centres or from clotting of
blood in the heart and vessels ; (b) that, since venom not
directly injected into the blood stream acts chiefly on the
nervous system, in such oases a nerve-stimulant like
Mueller’s strychnine would be appropriate treatment ;
(c) that, since venom injected directly into the blood-
stream acts chemically on the blood, in such cases a
chemical antagonist like Calmette’s chloride of lime
would be appropriate treatment; (d) that, since in any
given case of snakebite it would be practically impossible
to say whether the venom was injected directly into the
blood-stream or not, the best thing to do would be to use
both strychnine and chloride of lime. (5) Coming now to
Dr. Mueller’s personalities. As to my “ bits of knowledge
picked up promiscuously,” the worthy doctor isatfault.for
I have not only read a good deal on the subject, but have
also been an eye-witness of many experiments on rabbits
and dogs both by Dr. Martin, of Sydney, and Professor
Halford, of Melbourne. As to my being “jealous of the
success of the strychnine treatment," why should I he
jealous? It is just this, Dr. Mueller claims that strych-
nine is a universal antidote to snake-poison, but this is
denied by the majority of scientists, ( a) because strychnine
is only a nerve-stimulant, and could not counteract the
chemical action on the blood ; (6) because Dr. Mueller’s
reasoning is not logically sound, being open to the accusa-
tion of post hoc ergo propter hoc (or, as Dr. Mueller doesn’t
like ray ‘ ‘bits of Latin,” let me rather say the fallacy known
as “false cause’’); (c) because Dr. Mueller has not proved his
case scientifically, his conclusion being based on clinical
observation and not sufficiently verified by experimental
research. As to his assertion that lam mentally asinine,
1 take leave to point out that the apostle of strychnine is
passing a hasty ex pat te judgment on a man whom he
has never met and of whose identity he is entirely
ignorant ; also, that I am quite as well justified in agree-
ing with such men of light and leading as Weir-Mitchell,
Reichert, Brainard, Fayrer, Harley, Thomson, Calmette,
Halford, and Martin as I would be in adopting the “ not*
proven ” theory of, to use Dr. Mueller’s own description
of himself on page 79 of his hook, “ an obscure Australian
country practitioner.” — Yours truly, Steele Grev.

The first public airing Vic. of trousered
women, which took place in recently, did not create
a very favorable impression owing to the general
bony and unshapely aspect of the legs revealed,
and the palpable home-made atmosphere which
hung around the bifurcated The suc-
cess of this dress-evolution depends entirely on the
choice of pretty, well-built pioneers with limbs of
stately grace. It is a bad thing, by the way, for
the bloomer brigade that Dudley Hardy’s dashing
and very feminine picture “Oh that Girl!” has
been so extensively-circulated in Australia. Men
mostly like their girls in that shape and dress.
However, many Melb. women are keen to
substitute baggy breeches for cumbrous skirts.
The originator of the recent “rational-dress”
picnic to Fernshawe declares that directly he
mentioned the matter to his female friends they
accepted the notion enthusiastically. Since then
he has been besieged by “revolting’ maidens,
who want to show their legs at the Easter picnic,
which, it is expected, will be attended by at least
thirty rationalised females. Dressmakers are
anticipating the craze by advertising patterns of
the double-barrelled garment in all sorts, shapes
and sizes.

The Girl of Yarmouth, who, according to
a London paper, has come here “to acquire a
larger acquaintance of men and manners than is
obtainable in the militia or in London ballrooms,”
has put up at Squatter Armytage’s Toorak man-
sion, which is now the converging point of gush-
ing Melb. femininity. The other day lie arranged
a ladies’ cricket-match. The moneyed maidens
rolled up in hordes, in anticipation of seeing the
youthful earl display his noble legs under a
shimmer of petticoat-lace, but expectations were
sadly dashed when the titled visitor went on to
bowl (left-handed) in ordinary every-day cricket
breeks.

The collapse of the Australian Eleven on
New Year’s Day is now said to be at least par-
tially connected with a certain promise made by
them to see the old year out at the ancestral home
of a fellow-player. They failed to appear, but
about 5 a.m. next morning, the cook, who had
cried herself to sleep at the thought of a fatted
calf and trimmings overdone to tinder, was
awakened by a belated chorus of “ We won t go
home.”
The experiences of a
milk-condensing company
in Illawarra (N.S.W.) dis-
trict form cheerful reading.
The manager talks of sus-
pending operations because
the dairymen cannot be
induced to supply clean
milk on any consideration.
“We find fowls’ droppings
in the cans,” he sadly re-
marks ; “ also corn, and all
sorts of rubbish.” Then he
tells a weird tale of a
farmer who puttied the
holes in his milk-tins with
soap, and, on being remon-
strated with, told the ob-
jector that he was fat too
particular for Illawarra.
There are also histories of
“ manure sinks,” from
which the cattle drink in
dry seasons; and, on the
whole, it is made pretty
clear that the sooner that
pending discovery of science
is consummated, and milk
is made direct from grass
without the intervention
of either the cow or her
proprietor, the better it
will be for the wretched
consumer of the unmen-
tionable abominations of
the milk-can.

In a certain Southern
district the mortality
among children suffering
from, say, diphtheria, be-
came alarmingly great.
One doctor, the leading
local practitioner, attended
95 per cent, of the cases.
The increasing loss of life
aroused suspicion as to his
method of treatment; and
the medico, without any
publicly - assigned reason,
ceased practising. Shortly
afterwards he died ; and it
leaked out that for 18
months previously he had
been insane, and had
treated his diphtheria
patients on a new and
original plan evolved out
of his insanity—hence the
funerals.
The alleged seduction, under peculiarly
Lusty circumstances, of a Sydney society lady by
the usual dashing militaire has formed the subject
of a military enquiry on which Gov. Duff will
decide the action to be taken. And now a naval
hero (some say, however, that the Lothario
belongs to the mercantile marine) is alleged to
have eloped with a well-known Sydney lady very
much his senior. Nothing like “ a well-considered
system of national defence ” as a school for society
scandal.

Complaints are still rife re the alleged local
feminine fondness for the English cricketing
colours. After all, it seems that the so-called alien
badge is a combination of the M.C.C. and N.S.W.
Association colours, adopted by the visitors as a
compliment to those who brought them out.

Because the Chief Justice insisted on
taking the chair at the citizens’ farewell to Gov.
Kintore in the Adelaide Town Hall, on Jan. 14,
the Mayor and all the Corporation stayed away.
To save expense the militia were not called out,
but the escort and guard of honor were formed of
policemen, some of whom had been on duty the
whole of the night before. There was no extra
pay.

The Braw Kintore leaves South Australia a somewhat
sadder man than he entered it. In one of his first

panied him from Home was a blow from which the

A Northern “society ” family lately placed

Another contingent of Rue Australians, 31
in number, has started for the land of the mando-
line, and the orange-groves, and the strange beasts
that bury themselves in your feet and have to be
dug out with a fork. Some of them are wives
who were left behind in the scrambling exodus of
1893 ; and one is a man who paid £274 into the
funds of the ill-fated colony and didn’t get Ins
passage after all. He has now paid £l7O more
and expects to really get there this time, so alto-
gether he will have paid £444 to arrive at a place
which is hardly worth half that amount all told.
Another squadron of emigrants is expected to go
out in March, so it would appear that the Hue
Australia myth isn’t quite dead, even now. Lhe
new arrivals are going by steamer via Monte

The cautious S.M. Herald on the decay
■of the Australian aboriginal (he is getting to be
chiefly a half-caste now, and thus is fulfilled the
myall prophecy, “ Go down blackfellow, jump up
wbitefellow ”)
As a half-caste he bears evidence usually of a social
relation which we condemn.
“ Usually ” is excellent. In Aug , 1882 there
were in N.S.W. 8919 “aboriginals (4494 i pure-
bred adults, 1546 pure-bred children, 1108 ha t-
caste adults and 1271 I.alf;-caste chi clren). in
1893 the figures were —I all-blooded adults, 2838,
children, 1144; half-caste adults, 1462; children,
1811. Total, 7255; decrease, 94. -The falbiig-
away, as per actual figures, looks small until the
tremendous decrease of pure-blood and increase o
mixed blood is noticed.
The estate of poor “ Champagne Beaney
suffered to the tune of ,£853 through the appeal
to the Privy Council, which reversed Vic. lull
Court’s decision re the famous Canterbury bequest.
How much more money was mopped up by the
two sets of proceedings in Melbourne the lawyers
only know. And now it is suggested that the
Canterbury £llO,OOO will not be devoted to the
founding 1 of a Beaney Institute at all, in which
case the Melbourne charities will take action to
obtain the aforesaid bequest for the “residue.”
But this sounds like too much joy for the wigs.
The Canterbury Corporation can scarcely be such
fools us to dream of departing from the terms of
the dead man’s bequest, seeing that they would
thereby risk an order for the restitution of mis-
applied funds, and costs, out of their own pockets.

young man, in fact, is always on
hand. The Cardinal, however,
has never yet been seen to speak to
that young man or to anybody else
in public. It’s a beastly thing to
have to Vie always dignified ; and
what a slow time that young man
must have! We have seen him
hundreds of times with the Car-
dinal, but we have never once met
him in the bald-heads’ row in the
theatre, or on the lawn at the races,
or gaily footing it round with his
coat off at a Chowder picnic, or
doing the kitchen-lancers at'Cony's
pavilion, or swinging his girl round
at Clontarf. Never has he been
observed by any member of the staff
blowing the froth off the sanctified
tanglefoot brewed by Sir James
Toohey, K.S.G-. And yet that
young man has gladsome
aspirations in his heart of
hearts, for we lately saw
him carrying round a copy
of The Bulletin—carefully
wrapped up in the Sydney
Morning Herald.
It is no secret that Chief-
Adulator Way is in hopes of some
day becoming “Lord Way, of Montefiore,” and
also Chief Justice of Federated Australia.

Phil May and Ugo Catani are said to be
working up a Bohemian Club in London on
strictly temperance principles. No drinks, no
cards, no billiards, no nothing save lounging-
cliairs, and tobacco, and intellectual repose. It is
to be called “ The Long Livers’ Club.” The idea
was probably suggested by George Ashton to
Catani in the first instance, the dapper little
Italian carrying it along to May, who thought it
rather a good joke. George Ashton, when in Mel-
bourne, always preferred a feast of reason and a
flow of tea to a splitting headache next morning,
and Catani, whose studio was on the same floor,
used to drop in and gaze at his friend’s healthy
appearance with sincere admiration. The thought
that he himself didn’t look robust seemed to haunt
little Cat., though the society girls took kindly
to his feminine complexion and were apt to call
him “ quite a darling.”

Dear Bulletin, —“ Samuel Ballarat ” ap-

old ecclesiastical assumption that the conscience
is something more than “artificial.” How’s
this for an analysis ? Mental kink, due to early
inculcation, '5O. Unreasoning amenability as
gregarious animals—to the prevailing opinions of
our kind, '2O. Imaginative self-presentment of
general reprobation, T 5. Superstition—an intel-

Editor Bulletin, —A week or two ago,
the curtain fell upon the last act of one of those
mysterious and characteristic tragedies which com-
pose almost the only history of the solitudes of
this vast continent. The steamer Nile was en
route tor Balranald, and when a few miles up the
Murrumbidgee from its junction with the Murray,
the helmsman observed a man, whom he took to
be asleep, lying on the broad of his back, not far
distant from the bank. A gun lay across his
shoulder, a dog by his side, and a boat at the
water’s edge. No particular notice was taken
of those signs, but when, on the steamer’s
return a fortnight later, they remained
almost unaltered, a party put off to investi-
gate. The dog, the only evidence of life,
welcomed them with delight, and led the way to
his master’s corpse. Part of the remains was
missing. A deep indentation on the side of the
head, round which a handkerchief was tied ; and a
discharged gun-barrel, pointed to the probable
cause of death. There was plenty of food in the
boat, with the exception of meat; there were also
a few song-books, but no papers or anything else
likely to lead to identification, save perhaps the
name of the boat. That, distinctly painted on
the bow, was “ God Knows Who.”- —F.M.L.

KINTORE’S FAREWELL.
The Lord Kintore from Austral’s shore
Has tore himself away ;
Before he went that raw-boned gent
Found lots of things to say.
On either hand a chosen band
Assisted at the scene,
When Kintore sly, witli humid eye,
Said : “ Never try to break the tie
That binds you to the Queen ;
I mean
Your Mother Country’s Queen.
“ If, soon or late, you federate,
Still prate about the Throne ;
For, bless my heart! you mustn’t start
A nation ‘ on your own.’
Meantime, restrain your liking vain
On Parliament to lean.
And do, I pray, by night and day
Take heed alway to sing or say
‘ God save our Gracious Queen,
Serene,
Our Mother Country’s Queen ! ’
“ That raggy- 1 gag,’ the British Flag,
Should drag your trade in tow ;
In fact, in short, you must import
From Hingland, d jnoherknow.
Now, fare you well ! I go to dwell
Where aye my heart has been.
Oh, do not cry, or sob, or sigh,
But loyally maintain the tie
Which binds you to the Queen ;
I mean
Your Mother Country’s Queen.”

Minister Carruthers attributes the failure
of Pitt Town (N.S.W.) settlers to “badland,”
Now, the land was chosen by one Govt, expert,
approved by two others, and consistently praised
by Board of Control, superintendent, and settlers,
until it became evident the settlement was
doomed. Dr. Roseby’s famous panegyric of the
“ beautiful, simple, Arcadian ” life was illustrated
by a variety of vegetables posed in triumphant
proof of the quality of settlement soil—which, in
parts, is at least as good as that from which un-
subsidised settlers around have carved out com-
fortable homes. But any excuse serves to cover
up the hideous deficiencies of the pauperising
settlement system.

The latest Tichborne legend is that the
real Roger, heir to over £30,000 a year, lived and
died in a stealthy sort of fashion as a pauper at
Geelong (Vic.), apparently for no other reason
than that he liked to be a pauper. The story rests
on the assertion that he communicated his secret
to a priest in his last illness. Which reminds the
present writer that many years ago an old man, in
his last illness, acknowledged to him that he was
really Queen Elizabeth. Probably the Geelong
pauper of the fifties was Queen Elizabeth also.

Ed. Bulletin,—lt is high time the police

such resorts as Mosman’s Bay and Coogee. One
black-bearded ruffian, who carries a heavy crop-

hands and knees, creeping about Coogee shore-

jury it was a case of murder, when all the time
they know it to be simply an execution. —N.S.F.

analogy is unhappy, from whatever standpoint it
be examined. But what will the archbishop say
when, as in the course of time must come to pass,
the courts will give audience to all men competent
to discuss the matters in dispute, irrespective of
wig, gown, or a “ call in due order ?” Will the
right the archbishop claims now expire with that

The Saturday half-holiday, say the police,
is highly appreciated by a sodden section of the
Sydney community. Between noon and midnight
numbers of swollen-faced men get drunk three
times, sobering up by a sleep in the park after
each bout. They do not carouse or expand in
jollity or cultivate excitement ; they simply swal-
low (mostly beer) till drunk, stagger into the
park, sleep themselves back to reason and repeat
the process.

O. Mason : Well, and suppose “ the Protestants” did help
to inaugurate the secular education system whereas the
Roman Catholics opposed it, what does that prove, in the
light of the present? Does it prove that “the Protest-
ants” favored secular education solely in the interests of
their own religion, or as a means of aiming a blow at the
Pope? The alleged orthodox religionist who encourages
secular education saws at the larynx of his Joss. The
squabbles of rival creeds have advantaged the general
community, which wants its children to meet on a common
ground... Daubigny: Letter posted. Only one available.

Thomas Castro, whose mother was a Provenq il, and lady’s

whose mother was one of the Ortons, and housemaid in

larrikin was ever, or will ever, be flogged. The lash is

therefore be strenuously resisted by every democrat. (2)

A commercial dictionary, date 1819, shows
that Protectionist England levied a duty of 6d.
per lb. on imported bacon. The duty on striped
linens was ,£172 10s. per the £lOO value, if allowed
to enter the country at all. Some kinds of linen
were seemingly prohibited in England at this
time. Cotton threads and woollen piece goods
were subject to 50 per cent duty, and pictures,
ranging between 2ft. and 4ft. square, paid £6 16s,
each at the Customs. Eor anything over 4ft.
squ ire the tax was £6 16s. There were no oleo-
graphs to offend the eye in those days, which, by
the way, were the good old days, so much admired
by Australian Freetraders as a rule.
Dear Bulletin, —It was unnecessary for
the late Judge Stephen to remark that Mrs.
Stephen “ didn’t always err on the side of mercy.”
We have only to listen to the feminine gabble
over any great crime to be convinced that woman
is a vastly more unmerciful animal than man;
partly because the emotional is crueller than the
logical, and partly because an inferior power of
generalisation and a narrower contact witli human
nature render the average woman infinitely less
Capable than the average man of making with the
offender that imaginative exchange of individu-
ality without which there would be uo such thing
as mercy.—A.M.

My Dear Moorabinda—
It was deeply interesting at Bong Bong (Moss
Yale) races, which were the social event of last
week, to see how happy the ’Ome brigade looked
splashing round in the mud, which is, after all,
an Englishman’s native element. Gov. Duff, in
baggy riding breeches and long yellow boots, stood
out in the Scotch mist, on Bong Bong Cup day,
looking as much at home as a duck in a frog-pond.
Lady Duff, in a Wonga-pigeon-colored suit with a
white vest and a toque hat weirdly reminiscent of
the pinky-topped cake you meet at a birthday-tea,
also ignored the dew-drops ; but Lady Hopetoun
(all the men were loud in admiration of her
granite-blue-colored serge suit with pale-pink
necktie and neat white sailor hat with a pink band)
spent most of her day in the judge’s box—a toll-
bar like structure with only one opening. This
strikes me as being a most humane idea for vice-
regal accommodation in public places—on the
well-known principle that a man can always fight
beat with his back against a wall.
Seeing how sloppy the day was the dresses on
view at this little sporting fixture—generally as
dressy as a little Melbourne Cup, although the
lawn is only about the size of a pocket-handker-
chief —were not very fussy, though, as most of the
gowning was strictly suitable, it was necessarily
in good taste. Mrs. Archie Young, who enter-
tained the vice-regal party at luncheon, wore a
black gown with bands of white silk covered with
black insertion topped off by a wide black hat,
and her sartorial antithesis was a lady gotten up
in green satin covered with black net—a lace
hat in black and pink, a pink chiffon ruffle, a big
pink rose, all alive oh ! (as Bland Holt would say)
in her bosom, and a grey fur boa. Fur, lace, and
flowers. You can see for yourself how the com-
ponent parts of her get-up absolutely swore at one
another. A pretty girl in a heliotrope pongee silk
gown and a leghorn hat was a most fetching mem-
ber of the budding brigade. From Sydney came,
amongst others, Miss Maude Roberts in navy-
blue, and Miss Bessie Tarrant also in dark blue.
Two pretty girls in cinnamon-brown riding-habits
of the “ box-bottom ” cut, which looks so dashing
up, but reveals so much on the near-side when
Diana is afoot, suggested the first phase of the
New Woman in N.S.W. when you saw them left-
side on. I also wonder why a very tall girl dressed
herself in vine-green ?
Captain Wallington was there. I hear he joins
the Duff household after he has superintended the
embarkation of the Hopetouns, and Governor
Duff should shake hands with himself thereupon.
“Pipple say,” indeed, the captain is subsidised by
the British Government to hang about down
under as bear-leader to strange Governors feeling
their official feet, and, considering that he came
with the Caringtons and has pottered about Aus-
tralia ever since, it really looks as if there was
something in the rumor. At any rate, it is signi-
ficant that Captain Wallington has never been
associated with a vice-regal frost, and if Gov.
Duff doesn’t appreciate him he is a doomed poten-
tate.
Captain Wallington aforesaid, in ginger cheeks
and bright yellow leggings, on Bong Bong lawn
was a sight for the gods; but, indeed, all the men
were in mufti, and I shall never forget one local
nabob in pale emu-green with a sallow-colored
necktie to match his complexion and yellow
leggings on his spider shanks. He could have
gone to any bal masque and made a great hit as a
canvas-back duck. Though, perhaps, the funniest
man was a well-known youth in cream-colored
pants, light coat, big pearl buttons on his vest, a
pink shirt, black tie, tan boots, and a burnt
cabbage-tree hat the shape of a strawberry pottle.
He was a novelty, though, of course, every true
Australian knows that cabbage-tree hats (often
costing many guineas apiece) are like meerschaum
pipes—the dirtier they are the more distingue.
Still, the ensemble of this festive youth suggested
the title-page of a comic song.
A novelty at Bong Bong this year was the dis-
play of the prizes, which'were, for once, not all
jewellery. Is it a sign of the times that the club has
taken to crowning the victors with silver salad-
bowls and entree-dishes —utility as well as
ornament?—set out in glittering array on the
grand-stand. The ladies’ bracelet—a rather ugly
gold curb-chain, set with four jewels, was carried
off by Mr. A. Cordeaux, who won the Bong Bong
Cup (a massive silver service) with the same horse,
“Clive.” Talking about horses, the French of a
prominent sporting man must be very staggery, or
was it the printer’s fault that Mr. Blank Dash’s
chestnut mare, “ Merveilleux,” figured pro-
minently in the pink programme?
The second day at Bong Bong came down even
a worse soaker than the first. No vice-regalities
turned up (not even Lady Hopetoun), but still the
races were a success, if only for the champion
opportunity the many rnud-puddles afforded for
Bowral belledom to exhibit its credentials for the
front row of the ballet. One strawberry blonde,
in gas-green with tan stockings, was especially
careful of the hem of her frook. The girl with
lemonade-bottle legs is always much less of a
draggle-tail than the syren who goes through life
on a pair of axe-handles.
There was only a pinch of dressing on the second
day. The prizes were given by Mrs. Young
in the absence of Lady Duff, and then the
curtain fell over the annual sporting carnival of
the Moss Vale district, which was quite a success,
in spite of the naughty weather. The only draw-
backs I could see were the absence of music (even
a concertina would have been thankfully received)
and the presence of the whitewashed lawn-fence.
Anybody in dark colors wrecked her appearance
for the day if she leant against it.
From the general atmosphere, Gov. Duff seems
to be about as popular in his Sutton Forest retreat
as he is at the top of Bent-street. Ever since
his speech (it was at the first test cricket-match,
wasn’t it?), in which he alluded in a vague and
puzzled sort of way to his suite having once
played a game with the Moss Yale butchers, he
believed—said “butchers” being the ultra-fashion-
able Moss Vale and Bowral Club men—he has
seemingly seen fit to regard these gay and festive
blades (who rather enjoy the situation, I believe !)
as the “ butchers ” hereinbefore alluded to.
At a cricket-match at Hill View, last week, for
instance, between the aforesaid club (whose pretty
club-house and grounds are one of the neatest
things in Australia) and the Government House
young men, guess the amused surprise of the
former when, instead of being asked to meet Lady-
Duff and Lady Hopetoun and the rest of the
feminine interest at afternoon tea, the gilded
youths aforesaid were forced to refresh themselves
with coarse mugs of tea set at tables draped in
newspaper ! However, the visiting team should
be humbly grateful for even that little improve-
ment. All reforms move slowly. Last year, it is
averred, His Ex. served them out “colonial ’’ ale
in watering-pots.
The Sydney military scandal (I understand that
the full particulars are too Zolaesque for publica-
tion) is doubtless a very disgusting affair, taken on
its merits, and yet there is a comical side to the
whole thing. I allude to the ill-concealed un-
easiness of a great many gallant warriors (andl
possibly a great many gallant warriors’ sisters,
cousins and aunts) at the unparalleled attitude
taken by the Chief Military Authority in the
affair. It has always been tacitly understood in
barracks that all scandals should (if the thing was
humanly possible) never be allowed to go beyond
the sentries, and for a Commandant to set his own
private emissaries on to the case and even inter-
view the lady in proper person is absolutely with-
out precedent, and is a very worrying develop-
ment in his general r6le of martinet.
The wife of a well-known “ river ” Lothario
lately got to hear of certain alleged proceedings
of I)is, and set out one evening in a surprise-party
of one for the usual trysting spot. Mrs. Lothario
left the steamer at the wrong place ; and, seeing a
shadowy girlish form looming sylphlike in the
twilight, she never paused for further evidence, but
broke her best brolly over the hussy’s head strictly
on the Irish principle. But imagine her horror
when she found she had been fruitlessly damaging
the young and innocent che-yild of a resident
official !
Touching on the Flossie subject, a correspondent-
reminds me of the pantomime ladies who are fairy
queens and other diaphonous creatures in the
coming pantos., and who are beginning to throng
the streets on their way to and from rehearsal o’
mornings. “ What becomes of them,” mournfully
queries my correspondent, “ when they lose their
juvenility, when old age creeps on them and
wrinkles take the place of the curves of beauty ? ”
What becomes of them?—the same thing that
becomes of dead donkeys. You never saw an old
ballet-girlout of a job in your life —they are all in the-
back and middle rows. People in search of strik-
ing instances of sprightly longevity and models of
a green old age are advised to apply at the stage-
door during the run of any show with tights in it.
Indeed, when you come to look at the thing all
round, the chorus is the only place of safety for
aged females with something of a kick left in
them. And, as to the query about how they keep
body and soul together in the off-season, I can’t
help thinking that’s nobody’s affair. You see
books which promise to tell you how a ballet-girl
wears diamonds on 30s. a week, but that goes with
the wicked-Jook yarns. The plain work-a-day
coryphee is mostly a well-meaning old lady who
knits babies’ boots in the greenroom and takes in
washing between her glittering engagements.
An interesting agony advt. from a Sydney
daily :
rpALL Lady, grey dress, came late Rev. ’s
meeting Sunday evg., please write 1. J.W., Q.P.O.
If there is much more of this sort of thing, the
bare benches of the evangelical enthusiast will be
as promising a happy hunting-ground for the
golden-haired brigade as The Strand after Bp.m,
The suspicious wives of “business-men ” will look
askance at hubby when he wants to get his little
soul insured seven nights a week, and the wise
matrons, who go along too, will spend so much
time in watching to see whether the plump en-
quirer in pink really winked at Thomas or not
that they might as well be at a music ’all, for all
the spiritual benefit they get out of it. That is
the worst of large public gatherings, with no sort
of espionage at the door. A nice young man is
never sure that the demure, strange damsel who
shares his hymn-book with him won’t persist ia
calling him “ ducky ” under cover of the music.
Max O’Rell’s far-fetched story about the pro-
cession of hansom cabs with drawn blinds has
stirred Potts Point to the very depths, because
Max describes the criminals who travel in these
dubious vehicles as belonging “ to the superior
classes.” Max says the procession moves at 10
a.m., as a general thing, and that the women are
closely veiled. But what about the men? Are
they veiled, too? Or does the frisky fat man (the
local Lotharios are generally bald and fatherly) go
out brazenly in the myriad-eyed morning with a
mysterious female in a common cab, and risk his
pansy-blossom appealing to Judge Windeyer ?
I don’t mean to argue for a moment that Sydney
is altogether innocent of the true use and applica-
tion of a cab with the blinds down. I would say
so if I thought anybody would believe me, just to
give the moral prestige of the city of the Beautiful
Harbor a lift; but it is certainly a fact that blind-
drawn cabs aren’t so wholesale as Mons. Blouet
was led to believe. You can nearly always tell a
dubious cab by the attitude of the cabman. He is
generally flat on his face collecting evidence
(which, to do him justice, he hardly ever uses,
these little affairs being professional secrets) while
the horse drives itself along the bushy suburban
road. I know it isn’t much use bringing forward
the fact that in only one Sydney cause ce!6bre the
blinds-down hansom played a prominent part.
Cabmen, like waiters, are not as other witnesses
are, but still the fact goes for something when you
consider how hungrily the private ’tec. haunts
Venus and Adonis nowadays.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
When Giffen won the toss in Adelaide, Stoddart
gave the Australians 400. “ They are a weaker team than
the ones we met in Melb. and Sydney,” said Stoddart,
“ because they have only one bowler ; but they can hat,
anyway.” George Giffen was delighted at the heat of the
day, but he never dreamt of the disasters that came.
Bruce gave M‘Laren a catch —he dropped it. “ Now he’s
right lor 100,” said Briggs, but he played a ball on to the
wicket next over.
Trott was run-out while batting beautifully.
Then Iredale, Darling, Gregory, Harry, and Worrall were
out for 15 runs between them 1
On the first day there was only one fine catch,
but it was worth going miles to see. Jarvis, who was
batting well, stood up and drove Lockwood hard back,
and the bowler sprang at it, catching the ball in one
hand. It was the catch of the match.
With 9 wickets down for 157 the Australians
were given 160. “It must be a bad wicket,” was the
verdict of the crowd. Then Albert Trott and Callaway
trounced the bowling, especially Lockwood. Ten after
ten mounted up until Callaway, who carries a stone and
a-half more flesh than he did a year ago, became com-
pletely exhausted and collapsed to Richardson. 239 all
out.
Blackham said the Englishmen would not make
200 on the wicket, which was a little fiery. Giffen gave
them 250 at the most. They would have made 300 only
for brilliant fielding. First, Bruce electrified the crowd
by catching Ward ; then Harry male a wonderful one-
handed catch, dismissing the dangerous Brockwell. Later
Worrall made a unique catch, a contortionist act which
alone was worth the admission money, and the same
brilliant player caught Richardson beautifully. The
Australian fielding was voted by the Englishmen the best
they have seen anywhere, and they frankly admit their
inferiority in that respect.
Giffen clean-bowled Stoddart, in Melb., for 173.
In Adelaide he clean-bowled him for one. It was a real
duel for supremacy, but very brief. Stoddart played
two balls confidently, two gingerly, and the fifth clean-
bowled him—a plain, straight ball, but it was “ Giffen’s
fast ball."
Perhaps not for safety, but for brilliancy,
Bruce’s 80 was a beautiful innings, and was almost as
rapidly made as Lyons’ great score at Lord’s, in ’94. It
was the most brilliant innings the writer has witnessed
on Adelaide Oval, and he has seen Lyons make most of
’ his big scores there. Bruce, when set, was dragging Peel
from the off-stump to square-leg with impunity.
* * * »
The Bulletin estimates that a good half of the
Adelaide victory comes through relying, for once, on men
rather than on reputations. Their performances showed
that several of the old heroes (who have done nobly in
their day) should have ceded to others the place of pride
.in the two previous test-matches. But they were picked
(or picked themselves) on the strength of their glorious
past, and cut a very poor figure in the inglorious present.
The justification of the new policy is its brilliant success.
* » * *
Dear Bulletin, — One Australian characteristic
—perhaps, after all, it's a general human charac-
teristic—is to take a beating badly and to be over-exultant
In victory. I was in Sydney when Beach beat Hanlan,
and remembrance of the wild delirium that ensued will not
soon fade away from my memory. If you ventured a
word in Hanlan’s favor it simply meant a plug in the eye.
1 think we have all been a little too cock-a whoop over the
Adelaide win. Let us comport ourselves with moderation
in the presence of so game and modest a sportsman as
Stoddart.—Emin.
* • • *
It is noteworthy that the Adelaide wicket, on
which the Englishmen have twice been badly beaten, is
the fastest in Australia, and consequently the one most
opposed to English conditions.
* ♦ ♦ *
The three test-matches have all been sensa-
tional, and the greatest sensation is the performance of
A. E. Trott in the last one. He scored 38 (not-out) in
the first innings, 72 (not-out) in the second (110 in all
without losing his wicket), and then as a bowler sent
eight Englishmen to the right-about for 43 runs.
» * • * *
When an Australian bowler does wonders, Aus-
tralia wins a test-match, and Trott's performance merits
the hope that the phenomenal bowler that Tub Bulletin
prayed for the other week has indeed arisen in his might.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
If Blaekham’s wisdom be commensurate with
his years, he will now resign the wicket-keeping premier-
ship. Age cannot be denied; and the father of modern
wicket-keepers should, after his brilliant 20 years, retire
in favor of younger men who, having learnt the art from
him, have the vigor of youth to enforce their claims.
Jarvis has certainly proved himself in the third test-
match to be more adroit than Blackham is now.
« ♦ • »
Dear Bulletin, —If Donnan comes off in
the Interprovincial match, New South Wales v.
Victoria, it will be hard to keep him out of
the Australian team for the next match. When
Donnan played with N.S.W. against the English, he
played two faultless innings for 37 and 39 respectively,
and secured two wickets for 44. Why Donnan was not
picked to play in Adelaide against the Englishmen is
rather a puzzle, for since the ’9O-’9l season he has come
off in the interprovincial matches there to the tune of
50 runs an innings. Last time he scored 24 and 48 not
out, against Giffen and Co., and Blackham, speaking of
this, said that of all batsmen he knows, Donnan is most at
home with the great Giffen. —W.
• * • •
Umpire Briscoe, representing N.S.W. in the
recent interprovincial matches against Victoria and
South Australia, had thus the best of opportunities for
forming an estimate of A. K. Trott. “Heis a grand bats-
man," says Mr. Briscoe, “ and a most wonderful field ;
if I wished to praise a cat’s nimbleness I should say it was as
j nimble as Trott when he brought off his two marvellous
catches in our match against the Vies. But, as for his
bowling, I think that his 8 for 43 against the Englishmen
is no criterion of his real merit; it only shows that it was
his day out. Give me Giffen, who got 2 for 57, far in
preference to Trott. Trott is the beat of the Vic. bowlers;
I saw him get 5 for 55 against our men in the Vie. match.
He holds the ball similarly to the generality of bowlers
who bowl an off break ; but his best ball, perhaps, is his
fast yorker, which is often red-hot. He is employed on
the ground by the East Melbourne Cricket Club, looking
after the ground in the morning, and in the afternoon
doing professional work for the club. Twenty-three or 24
years old, he is the embodiment of strength and supple-
ness.”
• * • •
Umpire Briscoe says that Callaway is in splendid
form, and although Adelaide ground suits his bowling, he
deserves all the wickets he seemed, even his 5 for 37
against the Englishmen. Briscoe thinks that the hall
which hit Ulinman oti the mouth won the match for
Adelaide against N.S.W. Callaway sent Blinman a fast
one which, gliding off his hat, struck the batsman with
great force in the mouth, knocking him s useless. Had
the ball missed Blinman's face, it. would have been caught
and Blinman would not tiave made bis fine stand. As it
was, no one could reach the ball in time. Blinman, when
he recovered consciousness, never thought of his wound,
which split botli Ids lips for three-quarters of an inch ; he
only asked, “ Am I out ? ”
» * » *
Syd. Gregory lias been quite ill of late; “ too
ill to play,” so his father says.
* ♦ • ♦
Adelaide ground, with its low brick wall in
front of the grand-stand, and its asphalt path encircling
it, is very severe on cricket balls. In the int [provincial
match, N.S.W. v. S.A., the first hall used was knocked to
pieces after 47 runs had been scored.
♦ ♦ * ♦
Lord Sheffield’s eleven came out with the avowed
intention of enlivening Australian hatting, and, in a
general way, they scored about 40 per cent, faster than
our men. Matters are quite otherwise with the present
team. Stoddart has slowed down surprisingly, and the
new dashing batsmen of the company, Ford, MacLaren
and Brockwell, are apt to get out as soon as they try to
dash much.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
The insobriety of one of the Englishmen is said
to have called forth Capt. Stoddart’s threat to oust the
offender from the team, under the behavior clause in their
agreement, unless he steadies himself.
* * » *
The rather absurd appearance given to Syd.
Gregory’s testimonial by his batting subsequent to his
big Sydney score hasn’t deterred a number of hysterical
busybodies from attempting an Albert Xrott testimonial.
This sort of thing justifies new-chum sneers at Australian
“ blow.” Time enough for gilding young Albert T. when
he has repeated his big performance in the next two
matches. What has become of the fast ball that Briggs
used to bring out occasionally in days of yore?
* * * *
Says Umpire Briscoe, of N.S.W. : “Ask me
who is the best of Australian batsmen, and I shall say
George Giften. Ask me who is the best of Australian
bowlers, and again I shall answer George Qiffen. George
Giffen is no more nor less than a phenomenal combination
of cricketing backbone and muscle. He will commence
to bowl at 12 o’clock and, keeping on till 5, his arm will
then come over with as tireless a swing, and his length
will be as good as at the day’s commencement. His pre-
cision is magical. In the interprovincial malch in
Adelaide, when Callaway came in, Giffen, knowing Calla-
way’s excellent off-stroke, said to me, ‘lt won’t do to
pitch them on the off to him.’ Nor did he; every bA.II
he sent down to Callaway was pitched on a line between
the batsman’s legs and the wicket. Then again, Moses,
during his long stay for 77, never got a ball from Giffen
to cut.
• • ♦ ♦
Giffen fought hard to secure the inclusion of
Lyons in the Australian team for the third test-match, bui
Turner and Blackham were obdurate.
♦ ♦ * ♦
As Worrall went out to field on the Saturday in
the first innings of the Englishmen in the Adelaide test-
match, a ragged little urchin standing near the pavilion-
gate called to himl ‘‘Now, then, Jack, catch three of
them out to make up for your duck.” When the Austra-
lians returned, three hours later, aftr the foreign stumps
had ail fallen for 124, the same juvenile prophet cried out
encouragingly; “What did 1 tell you, Jack?’’ The
happy cricketer smiled on his barracker benignly.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Umpire Briscoe places N.S.W. batsmen in this
order—Gregory, Moses, Iredale.
* * « *
A. E. Trott bowls an off-break, which, on a real
good wicket, doesn’t nip back more than two or three
inches. Howell, of N.S.W., with the same medium-pace,
same good-length ball, comes back an inch or two more.
♦ ♦ * *
Callaway, of N.S.W., is one of the best-tempered
cricketers alive, and is, therefore, one of the most popular
with cricketers themselves. He plays the game with an
earnest fun ; if a fieldsman drops a catch off him, he will
laugh at the blunder, and bowl away once more as merrily
as ever. Turner, on the contrary, shoots a glance at a
delinquent fieldsman which causes the blunderer to pray
for the earth to yawn and take him, and the climax of
thundering scowls is reached when Turner drops Donnan,
or Donnan drops Turner. These two bowlers, however,
are singularly unfortunate, and Dorman’s luck particu-
larly would at times ruin the temper of an angel.
* * * •
On their Adelaide performance the English men
haven’t a 5 to 1 ohance of winning the fourth test-match.
The all-round completeness of their failure on the big
Oval is, in fact, the best excuse that one can offer for pre-
dicting a win for them in Sydney. They were too much
beaten the other week. Young Trott and Callaway had
previously bowled against them without remarkable suc-
cess. They seem to be unduly frightened of Giffen, yet
they have scored heavily in Adelaide, Sydney, and Melb.
when Giffen was on the job. The bowling of the Aus-
tralians is the thing to be most considered in estimating
the chances of the next game, for phenomenal fielding,
such as they showed in Adelaide, doesn’t get much oppor-
tunity to assert itself when the batsmen are fairly at ease.
No catch of importance was missed whilst Stoddart and
co. njade their 475 runs in Melbourne ; the trouble was
that the Australians didn’t get enough chances. Nor
can the batting of the Australians be expected to win
them this fourth match—upon the Adelaide “form.”
The bowlers are their best card, and if that doesn’t collar
the other side’s batting it will be anybody’s game. Thus
far, the Australian scores have always been benefited by
the Britishers’ loose fielding, but they may presently im-
prove in the catching department. After saying all which,
we find ourselves remembering the old sporting truism
that “ Latest form is the best form to judge by.”
* * * •
Blackham, when he advocated Albert Trott’s
claims for the test-match, said, “ He’s a coming chain-
Sion.” “Yes,” said Giffen, “I’ve batted against his
owling, and he’s batted against my bowling, and I think
the same.”
• * * *
The best fieldsman in the third test-match was
Brown. He is the finest point yet seen in Australia.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
The Australians have made a bowling record.
In the first English innings, Trott was taken off and then
Callaway and Giffen bowled unchanged. In the second
innings, Callaway went off and Giffen and Albert Trott
secured the ten wickets. Where is there such a record
for a fine-weather match ?
♦ » * »
The Englishmen still stick to it, that Turner is
even now the prince of Australian bowlers.
m * ♦ *
Moses surprised everybody, and no one more
than himself, by his brilliant fielding in Adelaide.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
Certain prominent and high-toned barrackers
for the English cricket-team should certainly have better
taste than to openly ascribe the Adelaide defeat to “ the
sale of the game by those demned professionals.” One
good point about the Australian sport—it is free from the
everlasting snobbery which pervades the Hinglish article
from root to branch.
* * * *
- Peel scored a pair of spectacles in the last test-
match—the first made by any member of the team in
the tour.
* ♦ * *
Coningham complained to a Brisbane inter-
viewer that he was not given a show to bowl by Giffen,
who only allowed him two or three overs at a lime. He
declares he will play no more under Giffen.
* * * *
In the three test-matches, Australia scored 1857
runs and England 1579, leaving 278 runs in favor of ,Aus-
tralia. The Australians’ batting average is 28 per man,
and the Englishmen’s not quite 24.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Govt. Printing Office has turned
out a fine enlarged photo, of the first test-match, por-
traying the playing-on Deo. 15 when Blackham‘and Syd,
Gregory were batting. It is 15ft. in length.

cretionary Investing Clients of a 1 fiver' on that day

IS?” And. finally. PRESS OPINION of Feb. 6, 1894.-
“ These Discretionary Investments undertaken by Mr. A.
W. STEEL must perforce be better than backing

takes such Commissions when desired), and also better
than Sweeps, where the chances are 1000 to 1 against you,
whereas here the chances are all in your favor."

taken by Mr, Steel on ALL the Races, and he is so
operating, and anticipates a SUCCESSFUL time at

When the Bth man goes m how many wickets
are there to fall? ” This innocent query has caused much
trouble In Melh. lately. The cricketer who answers “3 ”
is met with hilarious scorn, and the following argument
usually convinces him that “4” is the proper answer:
When the Blh man goes in one “ not out” man is already
at the wickets—the 3 “ not out ” men still in the pavilion
make the total up to 5 4 wickets are, therefore, still to
fall. This argument is, of course, fallacy if we say “ Bth
ram in ” with the usual signification. The “Bth man in ”
is really the 9th-seeing that "2nd man in” follows 2
others and is the 3rd. The correct cricket answer to the
query is 3.

H. : “ Hear me out over cricket. I call it a
boy’s play-game. Suppose we heard the Americans had
gone balmy over a baseball match, what would we think?
In a parlous time like this, in poverty-stricken Melbourne,
it is absurd to see the population smoking its pipe round
a cricket-ground. Cricket is not a healthy game. No
very eminent cricketer has been long-lived. The knocks
received are mischievous. What, after all, is the great-
ness of a Giffen or a Gregory ? In the latter half of life
it is followed by blank disappointment and futility of
existence. All of us can recall examples.”

Ned Gregory has been caretaker of Sydney’s
chief cricket-ground since the inauguration of the Associa-
tion 17 years ago. His caretakership dates back for really
aquarter of-a-century, in the old “civil and military”
time. Gregory has tried many different soils in the pre-
paration of his famous wickets. Soil has been brought
from Kiama, N.S.W., and proved none too good; from
Merri Creek, Vic., whence to this day comes the soil for
the Melb. wicket; from Richmond, N.S.W. (it was on a
wicket of this that Murdoch compiled his 321 against Vic-
toria), and this Richmond soil always made a durable
wicket. The soil now' used, and which has been used for
the past three seasons, was brought from Bulli, N.S.W.
It is a brownish clay, and when sown with couch-grass
makes the best of wickets. Gregory says "It absorbs the
water like a sponge and lets it percolate ; it won’t let the
sun in and doesn’t crack.”
Gregory uses couch-grass on the wicket in pre-
ference to the combination of English rye and clover,
which makes the Melb. and Adelaide wickets faster than
his. "It is the couch, not climatic, influence, which makes
my wicket slower; but then mine is ever so much more
durable.” The fielding-ground isalso clothed with couch,
although varied with many patches of clover. The wicket
is rolled with a 36owt. roller, and mown—Gregory can’t
say how often. The fielding ground, as a rule, is mown
once a week, except in the month of February, when,
with ordinary good seasons, the grass grows more rapidly
than at any other time, necessitating mowing twice a
week. The ground is elliptical, its longer diameter being
176 yards and its shorter 165, and to mow it takes a little
over a day. The elliptical curve is flattened most in front
of the grand-stand ; this was done for the sake of the
grand-stand lawn.
Gregory’s horse is one of the most familiar
cricket patrons in Sydney. He dates his ser-
vices from the advent of the Cricket Association itself, so
that for 17 years Gregory has been his master. He was a
Maitland colt four years old when he commenced his
cricket-ground career, so he has now 21 years opposite
his name. Gregory’s house is at the ground, but the site
being low, and a large, foul-smelling pond being near,
two of his sons (including batsmen Syd.) and all his
daughters have at one time or other had typhoid.
Gregory says he has two splendid wickets in readiness for
the interprovincial and international matches.

If rowing is dead in Port Jackson, sailing is
very much alive, taking a line from the number of craft
which turned out on Saturday to witness the first inter-
provincial 22-footers’ champion race. Nineteen boats
started —five from Queensland, and fourteen from N.S.
Wales, the Esmeralda, Irex, and Vanina, all local boats,
finishing first, second, and third. The wind was fluky,
veering from South-east to East. The boats meet again
next Saturday at the Anniversary Regatta, when it is to
be hoped there will be a wholesome North-easter to give
the flyers a fair test “on the wind.” The Esmeralda was
built by James Hayes, of Balmain, and was sailed by
" Billy ” Bead.
* * * •
“Nick” Johnson, who owns the Sydney 22-
footer Irex, and lias sailed her with such signal success,
looks after his boat with the most scrupulous care. He
keeps her covered up in a shed at Lavender Bay, and
every day goes all over her with chamois leather, to
remove the faintest trace of damp. If he has been sailing
her on a Saturday afternoon and intends to sail again on
the coming Sunday, he nevertheless pulls her up into the
shed and covers her up for the Saturday night.

Sydney Rowing Association has notified that it
will object to any oarsmen who may have cycled for
money prizes being included in the next Vic. Inter-
provincial eight. This objection is unmistakeahly aimed
at Dawson, the brilliant how of the Melo. Mercantile’s
senior four, for, though many of the Vic. oarsmen who
have rowed, and still row, without question as amateurs,
are also cyclists, none but Dawson stands a chance of
inclusion in a representative crew. Technically, the
Sydney Association is right. Victorian cyclists, though
they may term themselves "cash amateurs,” are never-
theless professionals distinctly ; but the question arises
whether it is right for a man who is a professional in one
sport to he debarred from competing as an amateur
in others. The rule of the Vie. Association is
just as stringent as that of N.S.W., hut, as a matter of
fact, it is never enforced any more than that of the Foot-
ball Association, which, on paper, prohibits the profes-
sional peds. and pugs., that sprinkle every team, from
taking part.
As amateur cycling is dead as Julius Cassar in
Vie., and any bov who can sit a machine properly imme-
diately enters the pro. ranks, the sooner this regulation
is changed the belter. Under its jurisdiction a man bom
at Hannan’s who lias won a 10s. wood-chopping competi-
tion, and who has probably never seen more than a panni-
kin of water all at once in his life, would he deemed a
professional oarsman and unfit to associate with the tony
amateurs of the Eastern cities. Let amateurism and pro-
fessionalism he kept as much apart as possible, hut don’t
let the former make a bigger fool of itself than it can help.
The bedrock of imbecility was reached by the rowing
scribe of the Australasian, who asked for certain oars-
men to be disqualified because they took part in an
amateur walking contest for a trophy, which happened to
be held on the M.O.G. the day of the Austral wheel race.
The N.S. Wales League promises the biggest
cycling show ever held in Australia in March next—£4oo
to be given away in prizes. Properly worked up, the
show should revive the boom of the Lee, Wood, Bennett
period of upwards of a decade since.

Young Rome, son of Tom Rome, so well-known
in Queensland, is a tine specimen of a young Australian,
writes a London correspondent to The Bulletin. He is
at Sandhurst, and is going for a commission in the
cavalry. He is the best rider, football player, runner,
cricketer, boxer, and all-round athlete at the College.
He has just been made an under-officer, vice one of the
Teck boys, and is so popular, and has such a name in the
service, that he has been offered the choice of three crack
regiments. Young Rome is a strapping fellow of six feet
one.

Dear Bulletin, —Re “G.W.M.’s” quotation
from Gatlin. The Mandan Indians’ swimming stroke is
nothing more or less than the “double-overarm” of
civilisation. Gatlin can’t have known the first thing
about his subject or he’d have known that it is the very
severest and the hardest to sustain of all styles, while the
ordinary breast-stroke, which he considers puts “ a
serous strain upon the chest, ’’ is the least-fatiguing one
in -lie. As a proof, it is the one used by all long-distance
swimmers throughout the world, however they may
revert to the more fanciful styles when spurting.—
Yours, F.

The unwearied efforts of the Melb. Sabbatarians
have at length produced fruit. The Vic. Ministry has
issued a proclamation prohibiting the pursuit of fishing—
with a seine nejt—on Sundays. But mark the duplicity of
this Godless Government! It does not forbid the Bad
Boy of the Sunday-school books, who goes out fishing on
[ the Sabbath and is drowned, from fishing as usual. On
the contrary, it conserves the fish for him, because there is
nothing said in the proclamation against the use of rod
and line. We want to be a boy again 1

Leishman, a German sailor, was fined £2 at
Willijinistown, Vic., the other day, for wanting to fight a
person named Smith with revolvers. Leishman informed
the Bench that he could not use his hands, and carried
the revolver to fight Britishers with. Leishman is deserv-
ing of sympathy. Some day, perhaps, it will be illegal for
a man to be able to use his hands.
At Goolma (N.S.W.) race-meeting recently, a
denizen of far-back took the odds on a horse and offered
the bookie a dozen wallaby-scalps in lieu of cash. These
were refused with many contemptuous colored adjectives,
to the great surprise of the bushman ; for no resident ever
dreams of refusing scalps at Goolma—not to mention
Goolmangar, Gooup, or Goonoo Goonoo.

The unlawful popularity of totalisators in Mel-
bourne is wonderful, and, from the proprietors’ point of
view, entirely satisfactory. A mere youth down Colling-
wood way, once a leading athlete, who, two years ago,
threw up his billet to run one, has on his own showing
cleared £5OOO each year. He views with equanimity a
matter of £3OO which has gone in fines and legal expenses.
One evidence of the general faith in his straightness is
the fact that every week hundreds of artisans and others
walk long distances to plank their shillings and half-
crowns on the machine—and then walk back again to save
tram-fares.

The death of one of two Englishmen who lately
had a water-drinking match is recalled by the recent

after being carried home, died the following day of peri-
tonitis.

It was very shocking of the M.C.O. captain to
declare an innings closed after wickets were down in
order that the other side might do some more batting on
soft ground. But didn’t Stoddart’s tail-end men play a
reckless, forcing game in the first innings of the Melb.
test-match, with the result that there was enough time
left for disposing of the Australians before the Sunday
rest enabled the wicket to get quite dry? However, the
cases were not on all fours. The Englishmen, having
batted first, couldn’t be accused of “besting” their
adversaries, anyway. If they made haste to get out after
luncheon it was a fair piece of generalship.
The success of the new Cannalin remedies

CARBINE.
Because his racing days are o’er
Shall we so soon forget
Those laurels that he won and wore
Are his for wearing yet ?
Because we’ll never see again
The blaze-face forging through
When the wild cry of “Carbine wins I"
Shakes all the vault of blue ;
Because they say that times are hard
And money bad to get,
When Carbine comes into the yard
Shall we so soon forget ?
If we should hold our pearl too cheap,
There’s some beyond the sea
Will dare to dip their Angers deep
To purchase such as he.
Then stand to Carbine, sportsmen true,
And rally round the ring,
And bold and high make bid and buy,
Whatever price he bring ;
For it will be a scorn and shame,
A dire disgraceful day,
If honor fail and gold prevail
And Carbine’s sold away.

A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big! Our Store is Big !
Our Ideas are Big!
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the p rev i° us Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.

IMPRISONED ON A SHIP.
The steamship Normannia, from Hamburg,
arrived in the port of New York on Saturday,
Sept. 3rd, 1892, with cases of cholera on board.
Many of the ship’s company had died on the pas-
sage. At Hamburg and elsewhere in Europe the
disease was raging. The authorities in America
were alarmed lest the scourge should be introduced
into that country. Hence they quarantined the
Normannia, with every soul of her passengers and
crew. The writer was a passenger. It was an
awful time. Death was among us and on all
sides of us. Nobody knew who next would fall.
We were imprisoned. Liberty never seemed so
fair, nor so far. We could neither fight nor fly.
There we were—hundreds of us —perfectly well,
and yet bound together as with chains, that the
health officer of the port might see whether the
plague would not yet break out in our midst.
When at last—after weeks of this —we were set on
shore, men lifted their hats and reverently said,
“ Thank God ! ”
This was being shut up under conditions to
make it horrible and fearful. Yet, any form of
incarceration is bad enough. Here is a woman,
for example, who says, “i never moved a yard
r>m my own doorstep for twenty weeks! ” Her own
house was a prison to her. Who had sentenced
her? A judge? No; a power greater and more
pitiless than any judge.
Her tale runs thus : In April, 1882, whilst living
at Lasher’s Farm, Old Sampford, Essex, a fire
broke out, and the family were burned out of
house ami home. We have no call to remark on
such a calamity. The very thought of it is fit to
make one shiver with dread. For most of us it is
like the world coming to an end to experience such
a disaster.
Well, what happened after that the lady shall
tell in her own fashion—the best of all fashions,
because it is plain and straight to the point. She
says; “Owing to our bedding being damp from
exposure, I took a bad cold, which brought on
rheumatic fever. For fourteen days I was con-
fined to my bed, and for twenty weeks I never
moved a yard from my own doorstep. After a
time the fever abated, leaving me weak, languid
and low. At first I had a sickening taste in the
mouth, and a poor appetite. No matter how
simple and light the food was, I was afraid to eat,
for it was sure to give me pain at the chest and
sides ; so I often had to loosen my corset and un-
dress mys ‘lf during the day. I could not bear the
weight of my clothing.
“I was constantly spitting up a sour, frothy
fluid, and had a gnawing pain at the pit of the
stomach—like hunger, and yet different. It was
with difficulty I voided the kidney secretion, and
my bowels, ankles and legs began to swell. I got
worse; I was in agony night and day, and could
not put my foot on the ground. Soon afterwards,
a husky cough took me, and my throat filled with
a thick phlegm. I could not sleep, and was never
easy. Later on, I had often to sit up in bed, fori
felt as if I should choke.
“ Year after year I continued to suffer in this
way, growing worse and worse, until I despaired
of ever being well again. But who can tell when
trouble will come, or when relief? A wonderful
Providence is over all.
“One day in June, a book came by post de-
scribing Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup and what
it had done for many poor sufferers. I got a
bottle from Mr. Suckling, medicine dealer, and
after taking it for a short time all pain left me,
and I gradually gained strength. By taking an
occasional dose I have since kept in good health,
and can eat and digest any kind of food. (Signed)
Mrs. Lydia Gkkkn, Moor End, Great Sampford,
via Braintree, Essex, Aug. 24th, 1892.”
Now, in order that Mrs. Green’s clear and
truthful statement may be of use to others (as
she desires it to be), we must add a word or two.
The bad cold she caught at the fire no doubt
“brought on” the rheumatic fever (as she
relates), but there was something back of the
cold, for a cold never causes rheumatism. The
r leumatio seeds, or poison, must already lie in
t ie blood ; and that poison is always created by
p -e-existing indigestion and dyspepsia, whether
the sufferer knows it or not. This is proved by
the fact that Mrs. Green’s chief ailment for ten
years after the fire was not rheumatism, but
indigestion and dyspepsia and dropsy, which is
one of its results and symptoms. When the
digestion was finally righted by the remedy she
alludes to, all her apparent maladies ceased
together. Why? Because she had but one, as we
have said.
Ah, yes, Disease is a stern gaoler. And how
sweet (and cheap) is liberty, obtained by Mother
Scigel’s help.
Winter’s Tail Melb. Standard staff.
A Melb. suburban boarding-place is called
“ Heaton House.”
Policeman X., defending himself from an
everyday Australian aspersion : —“ Let the papers
say what they likes about our watching the back-
doors of public-houses on Sundays, while thieves
make off with overcoats from the halls of the
boardinghouse-keepers—we’re doing the best thing
for the country. If we catch the publican, it's £3
fine into the State Treasury ; if we catch the thief,
it’s a month’s gaol or thereabouts, which means
£3 loss to the Treasury. I count hiding in the
back-yard of a pub. on Sundays the most patriotic
duty a number av the foorce can discharge. D’ye
moind me now?”
Dear Bulletin — Be the “Collins” and
“Salt” controversy, “Brigham Brown,” the
trenchant, doesn’t appear to have noticed that I
based my support of the saline end of the stick on
the ground that, whereas the gallant “Titus”
used the term “immorality” with reference to
mere breach of arbitrary conventions, the doughty
“Tom” had apparently in his eye that fulfilment
of sex-function which, as “Dr. 8.8. ” himself
admirably puts it, is no more inherently unclean
“ than the sparkle of a dewdrop or the rustle of a
leaf.” Excess—being abnormal —is, ipso facto,
injurious, but there may be an excess of repression
as well as of freedom, and the undue mortifica-
tion of any natural impulse is physiologically as
much a vice as its super-gratification. To
“Dr. B.B.” it will doubtless be no news
that while the “fasting,” for instance, of the
religious ascetic may, by diminishing vital force,
diminish, pari passd, certain physical appetites, it
balances matters by increasing to wolfish pitch
the not any less animal desire of hunger. Asceti-
cism, in a word, if it spiritualises with one hand,
brutalises with the other; and those atypical
persons to whom the exercise of the reproductive
function is professedly abhorrent stand—not, as
they flatter themselves, upon a higher plane of
evolution than their more normally constituted
fellows—but upon a lower ! They belong, in pro-
portion to the extent of their psycho-physical
aberration, to the domain of teratology, and are
far more akin to the two-headed calf than to the
elemental spirit. The octogenarian vigor of such
an abundant propagator of his species as the
just-dead De Lesseps is but one of many proofs
that rationally-exercised sexuality is a wholesome
thing, and that to unduly avoid the transfer of
vitality is not the best way to conserve it. —

The ex-legislator had long been a notorious
teetotaller—a reclaimed brand plucked from the
alcoholic burning. He had been noted as a boil-
ing geyser of vituperative eloquence, and could
move human masses with his platform oratory.
When election time came around, he was asked to
contest a much-coveted seat. He didn’t want to,
but a political agency dangled before him the bait
of <£loo for election expenses. The chance was
too tempting, so he resolved to cut in. He was
Mentor to a Telernachus, but for the nonce he
chose to reverse their mutual relations. Having
induced Telernachus to buy for him a bottle of
brandy and a pannikin, the pair retired to a
secluded spot in a popular reserve. “Telernachus,”
said Mentor, “I’ll tell you a secret. The public
credits me with possessing a strong stream of con-
vincing oratory. The public, as usual, is wrong.
I can’t spout worth a crow’s croak unless I’m
stoked up with alcohol. Sober, I experience stage-
fright in public. But I have now been a teeto-
taller for two years, and I’ve forgotten how much
brandy it takes to bring my eloquence to Plim-
soll-mark. I want you to note the number of doses,
and to mark the variations in my conversational
brilliancy. I will imagine you to be a public
meeting ; you may interject as impertinently as
you choose, and I will retort as the spirit inspires
me. This is not giving way, mind you, to the old
tyranny of alcoholism; this is merely using
liquor for a defined purpose. Now, for my first
dose.” . . . Six snifters, each three fingers
deep, had been imbibed. Mentor was rhapso-
dising on the inevitable and glorious destiny of an
Australian Republic. “Bah! you’d sell your
principles for a title and a pension,” sneered
Telernachus. “The long-eared idiot who inter-
jected that remark has no principles to hypothe-
cate,” retorted Mentor; “he has pawned his
lickspittle psychological conundrum for the husks
of a slavery which he is not intelligent enough to
despise ; he is a congener of the cheap, yellow
Chow, and of the murky Hindoo, and his filthy
soul is as grimy, as greasy and as odoriferous as a
blackfellow’s carcase.” “ You’re a blank—dash—
parenthesis asterisk exclamation liar, and a
” “I’ll break your this-and-that,”&o. . . .
Telernachus and Mentor were each next morning
“ fined £l, or ten days,” for “langwidge” and
drunkenness.

“ If every man had a home, what would
the landlords do for a living?”
“ All the reasonings of men are not worth
one sentiment of woman.” But which woman?
“ During the past session' Queensland has
been ruled by a majority of one—and that one was
drunk.”— Ogden, Q. M.L. A.
Webb, M.L. A., Yic. : “Paid Governors I
are the leaders of Australian extravagance.” Yet I
they are not always without saving grace.
“To Antiquarians. This Window for
Sale.” Notice on the big painted window, at
Whilom John Cleeland’s Melb. Albion Hotel.
Someone writes in S.M. Herald lamenting
the disappearance of Sydney harbor's primeval
beauty, “as Captain Cook saw it.” Now, Cook ,
never set eyes on “our beautiful harbor,” i
/The N.S.W. elopement-case, in which a|
young blacksmith marched off with the mother of |
ten children, one of whom he was allegedly court-
ing, recalls a Bulletin story in which the hero,
having married his mother-in-law, became known
as “ the bold McShane.”
In Australia, anyhow, King Cophetua,
who marries and bediamonds the beggar-maid,
mostly repents of his bargain in the long run.
The Bulletin has been counting up the Aus-
tralian Cophetuas on its fingers and toes and is
very sorry for them. As a generalisation—
Never educate a woman. Let her educate you.
The N.S.W. Railway Chief Co umiAfoner-
•hip question has now been settled 1 y Mr. Eddy
accepting 84000 a year for a further terra of seven
years—this arrangement t> be su ! ject to Parlia-
mentary ratification. The bargain is one of the
best things which has happened to N.S. W. since
the date of the Chief Commissioner’s original
appointment.
The Oountesa of Warwick— late Lady
Brooke, A. Edward’s beautiful friend — says that
it is a mistake to say that the British aristocracy
is rich. “ Many of us are deadly poor,” she says,
“little better than splendid paupers.” A little
while after she said this, she accidentally left her
gable cloak in a carriage. It was valued at .8800.
A Melbourne man was arrested at Ballarat
last week on a charge of abducting the children of
a Chinaman, with whose wife he had eloped. An
interesting case. The Australian matron couldn’t
relinquish her Chow unless she took their children
away with her—and the other man didn’t jib 1
True Love is indeed a great institution.
Charters Towers, writes a correspondent,
badly wants a democratic d uly paper, and is quite
able to support one. Tha ieus O’Kane, of the i
Miner, is long dead, and the old man’s hat doesn't
fib the crowd who now wear it.
Two men tried to smuggle spirits from the
ship Oambuswallace, stranded near Brisbane.
Both were caught by the Customs. One was a
big commercial magnate, who used his “ yot.”
He was fined .£5. The other was a poor devil in
pay of a publican. He was fined .£50 —£5 for
smuggling, and £45 because he did it in a hired
skiff.
To meet an insistent demand that this
characteristic Australian book should be procur-
able in more permanent form, “A Golden
Shanty,” by Bulletin writers, is now supplied in
neat cloth binding at 25., post free to any address, j
lb contains some of the best and most original
work which has helped to make The Bulletin
famous, and no Australian library is complete
without it.
The other day, at a very representative i
Melb. R.O. meeting, Archbishop Carr in the chair, [
an aggressive young barber denounced the local j
Catholic press. “Its only characteristic,” re- I
marked that barber, “is its well-ground scissors
and its well-filled gum-pot! ” Lo and behold, the
very next number came out with a two-column
report of a deputation to Dr. Carr himself, clipped
from the local Presbyterian organ !
The complainant in a late Melb. mainten-
ance case stated that upon one occasion when her
husband threatened to shoot her, she had been able
to save herself only by pointing to a new costume
lying on the bed and imploring him to “ let her
wear it once before she died.’ 1 It was probably a
Bloomer suit. The husband was weak enough to
grant her wish, and now, instead of being a cold
corpse, she draws 15s. per week from him for main-
tenance. Moral (an old one): Never draw unless
you mean to shoot.
A beautiful case of family affection was
seen the other day in a Melbourne police court.
A small boy, aged 11, was in trouble for burglary
and other misconduct, and his two smaller
brothers, aged nine and five respectively, turned
up in court and wanted to cheer and otherwise
express their gratification. Being ejected, they
hung round outside until the heir was despatched
in a cab to the reformatory, and then they ran
alongside the vehicle as far' as their short legs
would carry them, and told him how glad they
were generally. The scene was a valuable moral
lesson to any man who thinks of getting married
and becoming the father of three small boys.
“ It is a reflection upon the Lower House when people
exclaim, ‘ Thank Heaven for our Legislative Council I ’ ”
says Melb. Argus. Under the land-taxation circum-
stances to which the aforesaid newspaper referred the
reflection was decidedly cheerful. Robert Harper seems
to be the sole authority for the statement that certain
oeople did thank Heaven, and he forget to mention that
their gratitude is chronic. Harper and his little bunch of
admirers never go to bed until they have said “Grace "
over their h’Upper ’Ouse.
Commissioner Coombs is understood to
aspire to the generalship of the Salvation Army.
The S.M. Herald’s amusing par. showing
how the U.S. Associated Press exposed the tele-
graphic pilfering of the United Press is weak
reading alongside the late Thadeus O’Kane’s ex-
posure of similar pilfering on the part of a Queens-
land contemporary.
Quotation from a Hobart dressmaker’s
circular :
The Earl of Yarmouth has much pleasure in saying that
Miss Ashworth gave every satisfaction in the way in which
she made several Dresses for him for stage requirements,
besides doing all that was necessary in the smallest amount
of time,
“Handsome Charley” Lett, writes Mr. A.
0. Torrens, from London, “is one of the redeem-
ing points of the Imperial Institute, for he is
apparently the only man about the place who
knows anything about N.S. Wales, or other parts
of Australia. He works like a nigger, especially in
the interests of the N.S. W. meat-trade, and his
services are in great request by visitors.”
A sensible labor suggestion has been made
with the New Year. The executive Council of the
Australian Workers’ Union are asked, at the ap-
proaching Conference, to abol sh the practice of
appointing publicans as resident-agents of the
A.W.U. There is no goody-goodiness in this;
it is the common-sense prudence of sane men, who
don’t want to mix their labor reforms with their
liquors.
At the instance of Cr. Banfield, Ararat
(Vie.) borough Council has adopted a minimum-
wage, which has been fixed at ss. a day for
laborers and 7s. a day for artisans. It was over
this question that the feud arose between the
Hamilton Council and its Mayor. The latter was
in favor of the minimum-wage, whereas the Coun-
cillors opposed it tooth-and-nail. Since then the
Mayor has grown into a sort of local hero, and in
years to be—if, in the meantime, he does not be-
come asphyxiated by a rush of glory to the head —
he may be regarded as the tutelary demigod of
Hamilton.
Dear Bulletin, —Re “Slewed,” in a
recent Bulletin. J. J. Miller, the well-known
trotting man, has a private track at his residence,
Bayswater, Vic., and as it is situated on an angle
of a rough bush road strangers frequently do a
preliminary of two or three miles before they find
out their whereabouts. When a village settle-
ment was planted in the neighbourhood the poor
settlers on their way home from the Gully pubs,
spent many a weary night walking round and
round, until at last the compassionate J. J. had
movable hurdles put up to stop them. But some
of them wouldn’t be stopped, and one man next
morning told how he had lost his way home, and
had climbed at least 100 shaky fences, and he
didn’t think much of the men that put them up.—

President Faure is the first Protestant
ruler of France since the apostaey of Henry IV.
St. Stead : “ London always seems to me
one of the most risky experiments that God
Almighty ever tried.” It is impossible to rival
the grotesque blasphemy of a truly pious person.
Mr. J. W. Johnston, the new Sydney
city alderman, should form a very decided addi-
tion to the brains of the corporation. Mr. John-
ston is an accountant of the deepest dye and a
level-headed business man, whose quickness and
concreteness of expression have given him a front
place in all the numerous and successful com-
mercial enterprises with which he has been as-
sociated.
Is Anthony Hope, author of the sparkling
“Dolly Dialogues,” related to Gov. Hopetoun ?
His portrait in the last number of the Idler shows
a most marked resemblance.
John Earle, a Scotchman, bom 1779, is
the oldest living man in Britain. Ha is a High-
land shoemaker, and has three unmarried daughters
with him, aged respectively 91, 87, and 79!
“Queen Victoria,” says a snow-dropping
London weekly, “has written several books, and
you cannot flatter her more adroitly than by
affecting to treat her as a member of the republic
of letters.” Disraeli, like the wily Israelite he
was, once started a sentence : “ Authors, madame,
like your Majesty and myself.”
This is a time for giving thanks
To Providence —this is a time
When managers of brittle banks
Sing cheerily a song sublime.
An angry country may condemn
The Premier who dropped his Bill—
That matter matters not to them ;
Thank Heaven they’ve a Council still !
A gathering of forty-eight
Large representatives of Land,
Four-dozen pillars ”of the State
Who lovingly united stand
To block the course of simple right
And set aside the common will.
Whilst Harper, on his knees at night,
Thanks Heaven there’s a Council still !
“ All hope abandon,” Fat Man cries,
In warning tone, with frown severe ;
“ All hope abandon, he who tries
To pass direct taxation here.”
As well one might expect to see
A river winding up a hill.
To cast it forth they all agree—
Thank Heaven they’ve a Council still !
Thank Heaven for this chance, indeed,
To show the mass of careless fools
How Justice bows the knee to Greed
In places where old Fat Man rules,
And all the People’s voting strength
Is suddenly reduced to nil;
The sight shall make them rise at length
Thank Heaven they’ve a Council still !

Tins (from an autograph copy) is the sorb of
thing Caldwell, M.P., inflicts on his brother b.A.
legislators :
They are coming 1 they are coming I
Every day we see them come I
And in the Speaker’s gallery
The ladies seem at home.
Although their dresses look so gay,
Their faces look so charming,
Their presence in the Chamber now
Is pleasantly alarming.
So gracefully they sit and smile,
Those fascinating wenches;
They lure the very Ministers
From off the Treasury Benches.
The learned doctor often leaves
His colleagues when he's seen them,
And Jenkins, too, onr G.P.W.,
Glides off and sits between them.
But will they be contented there,
I wonder more and more ?
Or will the dearies soon demand
A seat udoii the floor?
If so, farewell to serious thought,
As Paddy Coglin said,
Men will no longer have control
Of either heart or head.
Dear ladies, you are very dear,
While still you smile afar ;
But, in the interests of mankind,
Oh, do not cross the Bar 1
Caldwell is the member who proposed emascu-
lation as a remedy for certain offences—evidently
not seeing that the chief argument against the
scheme is that it might bring down a lot of
people to the Oaldwellian poetic level.

The assertion that the Prince of Wales has
left Russia on excellent terms with the new Czar
provides The Age with a new argument in favor
of the monarchical system :
In international relationships the opportunities pos-
sessed hy the throne are of great and peculiar value. In
the intimacy and mutual regard of royal houses there are
abundant means of softening the roughness of official
strife, and restoring a friendly tone to diplomatic inter-
course.
Unfortunately for this pretty theory the mutual
animosities of royal houses have been directly
responsible for most of the bloodshed modern
Europe has seen, and the little differences of mon-
archies, instead of being settled in the backyard,
are fought out all over the continent.
Nervous sufferers will dud it worth their

THE EARL OF GARRICK
Has successfully tried “ Homocea.” Writing
from Mount Juliet, Thomastown, he says
“It is the most wonderful stuff I ever came
across. Please send me three boxes. 1 -gave
some to a labourer of mine who had a bad boil
>n his leg, and was quite lame. I saw him after
our days, and asked him what the “ Homocea
lid for him. He said he was entirely cured ; his
ivife, besides, had had a pain in her elbow, so
;hat she could not bend her arm for a year, and
it cured that. I also gave some to a woman with
a bad leg, and it is doing her good."

.
You need not put off your canter
for the sake of a premonitory cold,
with Homocea as a protector.'
A cold begins with inflammation of the membra-
neous lining of the intricate little passages of the
nise (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
snail scale). Homccea at once subdues the in-
flammation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
relieving the feeling of “stuffiness.” Moreover, it
farms a protective covering for the delicate mem
brane, and prevents cold air, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play,
Not much is known about the way in which mflu
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
Homocearoay.therefore, be confidently recomendedi
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
HOMOCEA v. RINGWORM CURED.
Hoylake, 19 Aug., 1893.
“Dear Sirs, —I want to thank you for that
wonderful preparation, ‘ Hcmocea,’ which we
use for about everything; but lately my little girl
had a bad ringworm on the head, and my doctor
said her hair would have to be cut close. But I
preferred using the ‘ Hcmocea,’ and in four days
it was quite well, and the doctor said I ought to
give ycu a testimonial, and I think so too.—
Yours truly. “ M. Aldred."
Lady Keane has much pleasure in recom-
mending Homocea as an invaluable remedy for
rheumatism, cuts, bruises, piles, sprains, &c. ;
she thinks so highly of it that she would not be
without it in the house, as it has entirely cured
her of rheumatism and other ailments. She can
also testify to the healing properties of *‘Hippacea’
for stable use.—Hillside, Bracknell, Bucks.

cea upon myself for Rheumatism. I found it did
more good to me than any embrocation I have
ever used, and several of my friends have bene-
fited by its use.

EPSON'S
Diaphragm Free Pump,
With Side or Bottom Inlet.
This Pump is designed for use in
Ships, Sewers, Cesspools, Pumping
from Water-holes on Stations, Irri-
gating, and all places where a ijood ,
low-priced, large, easy-working and
durable pump is required. It is com-
pact, strong, simple and effective. It
has simple valves, without the usual
working box in a cylinder. There is
but little wear, tear or friction. It is
double-acting in its delivery, giving a
steady stream. In short, it is the
cheapest and best free pump ever con-
ceived for the srrvice designed. For
verification we refer to any or all the
parties having them in use.
A Boy can pump 3000 gallons per hour
with one of these Pumps.
These pumps are operated usually
’by hand with a long iron handle,
1 which is supplied, but they can be
operated by steam or wind-power very
nicely in pairs, and for Irrigation,
where no forcing is necessary, no
better arrangement of pumping could
be made.

Marie Luella claims „to be a medium, or somethin? in

Fred. Belton, when in Sydney, used to relate that when
an Edinburgh panto, manager, he engaged the best
woman in the profession for the fairy. When she turned
up only at the last rehearsal, he was horrified to find her
a doubled-up, mumbling witch, looking like a mere heap
of clothes. At night, she bounded on, a thing of beauty
and a joy for four hours. Geo. Vandenhoff had a similar
experience, after rehearsing with ugly Miss Cushman for
the first time.
“Cronky ” writes ; “Alice Simmons’ is incomparably
the best voice in ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ though she
may be nothing more. On the opening night, the only
song of this Australian girl was placed in the first scene,
and gained a furious encore, while no other piece of sing-
ing obtained a genuine one. So (he song has been trans-
ferred to t,he last scene, while the transformation is being
arranged behind, and the audience are supposed to be
pumped out. Nevertheless, the encore comes again, and
the song is more brilliant than ever, like a refreshing
shower on faded roses. The Australians are so fond of
the English, you know.”

Irving, remarks The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
had a great ovation in Dublin, which, judging by the
newspaper accounts, could only have been equalled by
that received by Madame Ristori, in Sydney, the biggest
thing I ever knew in that line. That occasion will never
fade from my memory, as John Bushelle and “yours
truly,” at the request of the Marquise (who didn’t speak
a word of English), took it in turns to address the
enthusiastic crowd, at the Exchange Hotel, in the purest
Tuscan, as taught by that marvellous old polyglot,

Novel playbills for “The Judge,” at Melb. Bijou, are
blue writs issued by attorney Phil Stuart, in the suit of
William Elton and Co. v. “You.” They are quite genuine-
looking articles in their folded form, so much so that a
number of bank-clerks turned ghastly pale when a man
came round with a bag and solemnly served them across
the counter. In several oases the unhappy “tellers”
denied their identity on the spot, and told the supposed
limb of the law to—haw I—be d d. By the time he
had served all the available customers and heaved a
dozen or two up among the ledger-keepers, the writ-man
lost his terrors. Adolphus and Ferdinand smiled across
their lofty collars and thought it a splendid advt. But
imagine their feelings when the real writs arrive, at the
instance of a brutal tailor, or a beastly boarding-house
proprietor! The dear chappies will grab the documents
greedily, expecting more jokes, and O, what a difference
in the morning!

India presents a unique example of Free-
trade. When a five per cent, ad valorem duty
was levied, for purely revenue purposes, on im-
ports, cotton goods—which are now largely
manufactured in India —\vi re exempted, lest the
tax should encourage native industry and damage
the British importer. Now, as the result of much
pressure, an excise duty of five per cent, has been
placed on cotton goods locally manufactured, so
that the British importer is protected to that ex-
tent against the native manufacturer ! Evidently
the British importer isn’t a Freetrader save by
necessity. What he would like everywhere, as in
India, is Protection against the local producer,
but not being able to get it he contents himself
with preaching the iniquity of Protection in
general. Everybody is a Protectionist where his
own interests are concerned, only the avowed
Protectionist is willing to protect other people’s
uterests as well.

JOHN. A. MoCALL, President.
New York, Ist June, 1894.
The Hon. George S. Merrill,
Commissioner of Insurance, Boston, Mass.
Dear Sir,—On the 3Jtb of June, 1894, it will be three years since the “ Special examination ”of
this Company by the New York State Insurance Department. _ ■
Being strong in the belief that great public trusts, such as lifeinsurance companies, should be periodi-
cally investigated, at least every three years, as now required of domestic companies by the law ot your
State, and knowing that the New York State Insurance Department is, and will be, very busy with
other insurance companies this year, I invite your department conjointly with those of Kansas, Ohio,
Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Texas to make a “special examination” of this Company
as of 30th June instant, in such manner and with such expert assistance as you may
deem necessary, with the full assurance on my part that I desire the fullest and freest pub-
licity of everything connected with the Company, and for such purposes all books and all transactions
are open for your inspection and examination.
I desire at this time to mention that the coming year 1895 will be the “golden year ” of the Com-
pany, it having commenced business in 1845, so that it will be undoubtedly satisfactory to our policy-
holders, to the public, and to the insurance departments, to enter upon the year with a certificate of a
“ special examination ” by seven of our great States. —Very truly yours,
(Signed) JOHN A. McCALL, President.
Commissioners’ Certificate.
New York City, November 28, 1894.
WE, the Insurance Commissioners and Superintendents of the States of Massachusetts, Illinois,
Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Texas, pursuant to the invitation of the President of the
Company, dated June 1, 1894, do hereby certify that we have been for the past four mouths engaged
in a thorough and searching official investigation into the affairs of the New York Life Insurance
Company of the City of New York.
We further certify that each Stock and Bond owned, each Collateral Loan, each Bond and Mort-
gage Loan made, the Cash and each Bank Certificate of Deposit, was carefully examined, checked ami
verified ; that the Policy Loans and Premium Notes were examined and checked with the Reserve on
each Policy ; that Interest and Rents due and accrued, unreported and deferred Premiums, were also
verified ; that the values of Stocks and Bonds owned, and Real Estate owned, were individually and
closely scrutinised and conservatively made; that the title to each piece of property secured, and
Bond and Mortgage Loan made since the 1891 New York State Ihsurande Department Investigation,
was examined and found satisfactory. That the Policy Reserve was checked and verified by tin
Actuaries of our several State Insurance Departments, and that every Policy and its Reserve, on the book-
of the Company, was checked individually with the Valuation Policy Registers of the Massachusetts
Department; that all Sundry Liabilities were also verified; that each debit and credit entry in th.
Company’s books was checked from the date of the said New York State Investigation ; and that, :e-
a result, on the most conservative basis of valuation, we found the Company possessed of ASSJEki. -
satisfactory to us, amounting to
£31,986,302 4a. 2d.,
And that, after providing for all possible Liabilities, including £27,789,771 16s. 2d. for outstanding
Policy Reserve, as per the “ Combined Experience Table of Mortality,” with 4 per cent, interest, tin-
total of the same amounted to £28,420,650 19s, lOd.
We further certify that, by the severest test, the net surplus to policy-holders, after providing fui
every Liability, and deducting Agents’ Balances, was, on June 30, 1894,
£3,565,651 4s. 4d.
In Witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our respective names, in the City of New
York, the day and year above written.

During boom-time a builder erected a row of
workman’s cottages. He wished to sell at £2OO each, but
could not, so got an advance of £225 on each from a
building society, collected the rents for two years, and
never ma le a single repayment. The society took posses-
sion at the end of two years and—still holds the pro-
pe ty. Of course, liquidation has overtaken that society;
O.ie is almost tempted to inquire “ who was the sleeping
partner in the transaction ?”

Banks are institutions supported by Tom, Dick

ever a new co. starts. The knowing traders only accept
mist T.P. Co.’s reports as truthful when corroborated
by their own inquiries ; in fact, many houses are dropping

The English life-insurance companies are be-
ginning an invasion of Australia. The London and Lan-
ershire is now doing business in Victoria, and others are
expected to follow. The L, and L. is a proprietary office,
which sends a large amount of the profits to the share-
holders in dear old Hingtand, and the policy-holders get
what is left, instead of getting the lot as they do in the
mutual life societies of Australia. It issues a moderately
liberal policy aicording to English ideas—a conservative
life insurance policy, according to English ideas, is one
which is void if you commit suicide, if you are hanged,
if you take to drink, if you go to sea without permission
an 1 without paying an extra premium, if you travel on
land beyond the limits of certain specified countries
without permission and without paying an extra pre-
mium, if you engage in any one of a long list of
baza dous occupations without permission and payment
of an extra premium, and if you do a number of
other things. It has a reputation for fairness in the
matter of contesting claim lat law. When it does contest
a claim, however, the fact that its headquarters are in
England gives it first-class facilities for carrying appeals
to the Privy Council and bursting up plaintiff in the
matter of costs. Also, its entire belongings in Victoria
are set down as worth £12,425.

It is well-known that when an undesirable
tenant gets into a house, and has not enough furniture to
diitrain on, it takes the owner three weeks, according to
legal process, to get rid of him ; but in a certain police-
court list week it came to light that there is a shorter
and more effectual method. The agent for a lot of house-
property told an official that he never took out an eject-
ment-warrant, as lie had a cheaper way. “I grease the
fi igers of the policem in on the beat, and the tenant’s
always gone in twenty-four hours !’’

The law of distraint should be abolished, if only

Wyalong blew them back to Sydney with a plug of
dynamite. However, a large and indignant meeting has
been addressed by a much-respected and trusted soli-

and asked for proof, which the meeting was not in a posi-

old enough to die and be buried awhile. Some men, it is
true, have phenomenal luck, hut, on the average, on
settled fields, a man gets out of mining a reward in pro-
portion to what he puts in, and the fact that profits go
into few hands generally proves that pluck and per-

The Australian Gold Recovery Company are

battery made by the Austral Otis Engineering Co., with a
cyanide plant for the treatment of the tailings.*
The 20-head battery for the United Brothers
Gold-mining Company at Glen Wills, Gippsland, is now
being erected by the Austral Otis Engineering Company,

American principles, and will serve as a test of the advan-

.. » „ ~ Old Plant .. .. £176
This, and the reduction of the cost of chlorination by the
Hall-Riohards process, should enable the company to
treat profitably the two million tons of low-grade ore now
lying on their mullock heap.*

Johnson’s Antidote .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Down along the Snakebite River, where the
overlanders camp,
Where the serpents are in- millions, all of the
most deadly stamp ;
Where the station-cook in terror, nearly
every time he bakes,
Mixes up among the doughboys half-a-dozen
poison-snakes ;
Where the wily free-selector walks in armour-
plated pants,
And defies the stings of scorpions, and the
bites of bull-dog ants :
Where the adder and the viper tear each
other by the throat,
There it was that William Johnson sought
his snake-bite antidote.
Johnson was a free-selector, and his brain
went rather queer,
For the constant sight of serpents filled him
with a deadly fear ;
So h • tramped his free-selection, miming,
afte noon and night,
Seekii g fo some great specific that would
Cm., the serpent’s bite.
Till King B ily, of the Mooki, chieftain of
the flour-bag head.
Told him, “ Spos’n snake bite pfeller, pfeller
mostly drop down dead ;
Spos’n snake bite old goanna, then you
watch, a while you see,
Old goanna cure himself with eating little
pfeller tree.”
“That’s the cure,” said William Johnson,
“ point me out this plant sublime,”
But King Billy, feeling lazy, said he’d go
another time.
Thus it came to pass that Johnson, having
got the tale by rote,
Followed every stx-ay goanna, seeking for the
antidote.
*•••••
Loafing once beside the river, while he
thought his heart would break,
There he saw a big goanna, fighting with a
tiger-snake,
la and out they rolled land wriggled, bit
each other, heart and soul,
Till the valiant old goanna swallowed his
opponent, whole.
Breathless, Johnson sat and watched him,
saw him struggle up the bank,
Saw him nibbling at the branches of some
bushes, green and rank ;
S iw. him, happy and contented, lick his lips,
■as off he crept,
While the bulging in his stomach showed
where his opponent slept.
Then a cheer of exultation burst aloud from
Johnson’s throat ;
“Luck at last,” said he, “I’ve struck it!
’tis the famous antidote.”
“ Here it is, the Grand Elixir, greatest bless-
ing ever known,
T .venty thousand men in India die each year
of snakes alone.
T.iiuk of all the foreign nations, Negro,
Chow and blackamoor,
S ived from sudden expiration, by my won-
drous snakebite cure.
It will bring me fame and fortune ! In the
happy days to be,
Men of every clime and nation will be round
to gaze on me—
Scientific men in thousands, men of mark
and men of note,
Rushing down the Mooki River, after John-
son’s antidote.
It will cure delirium-tremens, when the
patient’s eyeballs stare
At imaginary spiders, snakes which really
are not there.
When he thinks he sees them wriggle, when
he thinks he sees them bloat,
It will cure him just to think of Johnson’s
Snakebite Antidote.
Then he rushed to the museum, found a
scientific man—
“ Trot me out a deadly serpent, just the
deadliest you can ;
I intend to let him bite me, all the risk I
will endure,
Just to prove the sterling value of my won-
drous snakebite cure.
Even though an adder bit me, hack to life
again I’d float ;
Snakes are out of date, I tell you, since I’ve
found the antidote.”
Said the scientific person, “ If you really
want to die,
Go ahead —but, if you’re doubtful, let your
sheep-dog have a try.
Get a pair of dogs and try it, let the snake
give both a nip ;
Give your dog the snakebite mixture, let the
other fellow rip ;
If he dies and yours survives him, then it
proves the thing is good.
Will you fetch your dog and try it 1 ” John-
son rather thought he would.
So he went and fetched his canine, hauled
him forward by the throat.
“Stump, old man,” says he, “we’ll show
them we’ve the gen wine antidote.”
Both the dogs were duly loaded with the
poison-gland’s contents ;
Johnson gave his dog the mixture, then sat
down to wait events.
“ Mark,” he said, “in twenty minutes
Stump’ll be a-rushing round,
While the other wretched creature lies a
corpse upon the ground.”
But, alas for William Johnson ! ere they’d
watched a half-hour’s spell
Stumpy was as dead as mutton, t’other dog
was live and well.
And the scientific person hurried off with
utmost speed,
Tested Johnson’s drug and found it was a
deadly poison-weed ;
Half a tumbler killed an emu, half a spoonful
killed a goat,
All the snakes on earth were harmless to that
awful antidote.
Down along the Mooki River, on the over-
landers’ camp,
Where the serpents are in millions, all of the
most deadly stamp,
Wanders, daily, William Johnson, down
among those poisonous hordes,
Shooting every stray goanna, calls them
“ black and yaller frauds.”
And King Billy, of the Mooki, cadging for
the cast-off coat,
Somehow seems to dodge the subject of
the snake-bite antidote.

Consolation.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There was moonlight on the water. The wind
blew cold from the south east and sent a gleaming
ripple across the bay. Far out the dark outline
of an island stood in relief against the sky; and
from the sands came the plaintive cry of a curlew.
A narrow jetty ran away out to the deep water.
From it a man sat fishing; his line loose in his
hand and a deep frown upon his forehead.
Fate had been cruel that day. The man had
told himself in the morning that he would confess
his love to the most adorable woman on earth,
and ask her to be his wife.
But circumstances had conspired, and he had
found no opportunity to speak with her alone.
And now, as he sat looking down at the shadows
on the water, he heard voices—a man and a
woman were singing, away up at the hotel on the
cliff. The voice of the man was that of his dearest
friend, and the woman's voice was the voice of her
he loved.
Hushed by the distance, he heard the deep
tones of the man as he sang—
one, dost thou love me true?
Tell me true, tell the t rue! . -
And her voice, how sweet it was I
Must I, then, my secret tell?—•
Yes, I love thee well.
Then their voices blended :
We are pledged to love for ever.
Let the world say what it may
Nought but death our hearts can saver.
Love with life shall pass away.
And the man on the jetty sighed.
The music ceased ; there was a sound of a door
opened apd closed ; and the figures of the singers
came down the hillside together. And the fisher-
man in the shadow heard their voices as they came
toward him. They spoke of music, of poetry, of
love ; and he knew as he listened that he had only
dreamed of happiness.
After a while the woman said, “How cold it
is !” and gave a little shiver. And the man by her
side took off his coat and threw it over her shoul-
ders. She protested, but he fastened it about her
throat.
As his fingers—a man’s fingers—fumbled at the
button-he said : “ Let me keep you from the cold
—dear —for always.” And she looked up at
him, and he clasped her in his arms and kissed her
lips.
The man sitting looking into the water felt that
there was nothing left for him t 6 live for. Now he
had not even a friend. But he kept the line in
his hand.
Back up the hill went the lovers with arms
entwined. And he was alone with his grief.
Presently his line tightened with a jerk. He
rose quickly to his feet, and hand over hand he
drew it in. The strain was great, and the frown
disappeared from his brow. Steadily now he
hauled in—cautiously—easy—ah ! Before him lay
the great shining scaly fish.
He smiled. His face was lit up with the smile.
He baited another hook, threw in his line, and
sitting down again looked fixedly into the water.
There are many good fish in the sea.

Dear Bulletin, —A word re your article
on “Imperial Zollverein.” The Farrer-Ecroyd
you mention was sometime M.P. for Preston.
He is considered the ablest and most successful
manufacturer in Lancashire. A few miles away,
on the Yorkshire side of the hill, lives Sam
Cunliffe Lister —now Lord Masham—perhaps the
ablest manufacturer in Yorkshire. These two led
the Fairtrade movement —Protection. On the
other hand, the Freetrade leaders, notwithstand-
ing your article, never amounted to much in trade.
Bright was not an active member in his Roch-
dale firm. I know the little Sabden mill where
Cobden failed when millhands rose to influence.
He ended as he began—a bagman. T. B. Potter
lives on the Freetrade movement. This little cir-
cumstance struck me directly I went to live in
Lancashire, and helped to convert me from Free-
trade.—Yours, V.

There are 250 compositors and 60 jour-

A little Yic. detective was specially
appointed to the force because he looked less like
a“D” than anything else. So effectually was
his identity disguised that, the other day, when,

“D” as the suspect, and let the spieler go, under
the impression that he was a plain-clothes con-
stable.
One day recently, just as N.S.W. Execu-

demned Frenchman Grenon, a black rat was
caught in the Council chamber. The omen was
sure. They decided to hang Grenon. But if it
had been a white rat Grenon would have been sent
to death all the same, under the savage Stephen
cod s, for the commission o' an offence which
would not be capitally punishable in England or
in America.
The French Government comes down on
the absentee with a heavy hand. Under the new
succession duties, any alien who dies possessed of
property in France is taxed, not only on that, but
on all his worldly possessions, no matter where
they may be. The heirs of an Englishman who
dies leaving .£1,000,000 worth of goods in England
and £5OOO in France must pay legacy-duty on the
whole million—which duty would, in some cases,
amount to £3oo,ooo—or else the French property
is forfeited for unpaid duty. They don’t love the
absentee in France as they do in Australia.
A Melbourne chemist, H. H. Browne,
seeks “the bubble, reputation’’ (and gets it, too,
in a local paper) on the strength of the death
of his elder brother, and of being one of a number of
other sons of a virile sire. As thus: “ John Robert
Browne, late of Betworth Park, Sussex, England,”
having recently died in his 81st year, the world is
informed that he was the eldest son of the late
John Browne of Norton Hall, Norfolk, whose
wife duly presented him with 2ti children—
-22 boys and 4 girls. Upon which South Melbourne
is duly informed by the local society paper that
it “should be proud of its chemist.” It is further
recounted that the 22 boys of the original John
Browne, of Norton Hall, were all six-footers.
Another policeman has been officially
killed in Maoriland —an up-country slave, who
did three men’s work and seldom had time to eat
his meals. He was on duty continually in his
own and surrounding districts, was clerk of the
Court, process-server, bailiff, tax collector, labor
agent, and eight other things besides. He applied
for assistance in vain, then asked for leave of
absence, which he didn’t get till it was too late.
When he did get it he had to be arrested as a
howling maniac, the victim of overwork. Then
he was committed to*an asylum, and on the way
there tried to jump out of the train. Before he
reached his destination he was stiff in death. A
mild rider from the coroner’s jury, and a news-
paper paragraph saying that “much sympathy is
felt for deceased’s family,’’complete the chronicle.
Samuel Deering’s C.M.G.-ship on Jan. 1
is generally supposed to be a hit at the Kingston
Ministry. Deering was until lately S. A. assistant
Agent-General, but was retrenched by Treas.
Playford. When Bray fell ill, Deering was men-
tioned as a good man to succeed him ; at any rate,
it was regarded as a certainty that he would be
asked to act temporarily, although then on leave.
But Tom Playford appointed Wicksteed Acting
Agent-General, and went to London himself at
£l5OO a year, although Deering would have been
a better man at £lOOO. Deering was much
aggrieved, and it is asserted he had a sympathiser
in a very prominent Adelaide official, with the
result now announced; But accursed is he who
maketh his brother a C.M.G.
One Victorian Fat Man, Coutts, M.L.C.,
announced, when the Land and Income-Tax Bill
came before the House of the Forty-eight Rich
Landlords, that “if called upon to vote at once
he would have to vote against the Bill, but with
time for consideration he would be able to give an
intelligent decision.” Coutts, you see, knew that
his vote against the Bill wasn’t an intelligent
decision, and, knowing that, he must have known
that a vote in favour of the Bill would be an in-
telligent decision. Yet if he was hurried over a
matter which had already been before the public
for over two months the old man deliberately
announced his resolve to give his unintelligent
decision out of pure cussedness. After all, how-
ever, it is questionable if a person who gives him-
self away so badly as this ever had any intelligent
decision about him.
Editor Bulletin, —Sir, allow me, as a
professional shorthand Writer, to state that, as far
as my knowledge of Sydney goes, the statements
contained in a recent par. are quite inaccurate.
The fee for professional writing in Sydney is and,
I believe, always has been £2 2s. a sitting (occa-
sionally modified to £1 Is. after the first day), and
Is. a folio of 72 words. It is the same in Victoria,
where the charge is regulated by Act of Parlia-
ment, and where anyone can practise in the Su-
preme Court and charge the price named, provided
he can pass a test of 150 words a minute. This,
however, is not the case in Sydney, although it
ought to be. It is quite possible that shorthand
writers may be found who will write shorthand for

glad to do it ; but there are shorthand writers and
shorthand writers. For one who can only write
100 words a minute,- £2 2s. a day would be too
much, but for an experienced and trustworthy
writer, who could, if required, pass the test named,
£2 2s. a day plus the foliage is, in my opinion,
none too high. Your correspondent implied that
a judicial decision had been recorded against the
shorthand fees named above, but I challenge
him to name the case.—Yours, etc., Percy R.
Meggy, 24/11/94.
[The decision was given by Mr. Delohery, P.M., of
Sydney, in (Jorlette v. Burcher. Mr. Meggy is arguing
against established facts, inasmuch as N.S.W. Govern-
ment now refuses, in more than one case, to pay “foliage
it merely gives £2 2s. a sitting and pays the type-writer.

LIFE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
How far, to tired and bloody feet still seems
The star that flickers far away, then gleams
With scornful light and, mocking, seems to say,
“This height thou’lt gain long ere the break of
day !”
How sweet—when after pains, and wounds, and
tears,
The feet have reached the goal of weary years—
To think : “ Alone I scaled the rugged steep,”
And drink the nectar of eternal sleep !
Yet mad it were to wish that all were bright
And glad ; for darkness ever makes the light,
And rest, sweet rest, is beautiful to-day
Because dark agonies beset life’s way.
Each soul toils ever on and on to reach
Its goal, and by the way the white bones bleach,
And gaunt and hideous faces ever gaze
And taunt the fainting traveller with praise.
Oh, God, on earth, in air, or stars or wind,
If God there be, show to each puny mind
That he who tries another’s grief to leaven
Finds for himself the shortest road to heaven.
A.P.
A Donkey Ride in Egypt.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Evert passenger by P. and 0., Orient, Mes-
sageries, or Nord-Deutscher-Lloyd boats, will
swear to the truth of the following narrative.
After nine days of monotonous roasting between
Colombo and the Suez Canal, on an outward-
bound liner from Australia, we were turned loose
for a few hours at Port Said, and scrambled
ashore in a roomy boat propelled by two dirty
Arab boys.
Port Said is inhabited by the scum of Europe,
shaken up with the scrapings of Asia, and
sprinkled with the seourings of Africa —of both
sexes.
The main street consists of a long, narrow
thoroughfare, containing principally photo-
graphers’ shops, where indescribable pictures are
offered for sale. Further on, there are two
casinos, where the bands, composed of fat Dutch
women and boys, discourse sweet music by the
sweat of their brow. Side-rooms are available for
roulette, baccarat, or jietits chevaux, and the
weary “ Faites vos jeux, messieurs ” and the chink
of coin reminds one of Monte Carlo, or any Con-
tinental kursaal.
H re in the casino, the passengers sit and drink
muddy Turkish coffee, warding off meanwhile the
obscene photo.-vendor, the bagnio-tout, the pro-
fessional gambler, and the insidious youth who
invites you to accompany him to see the can can
danced.
Sametimes the passengers from three or four
different liners are let loose together while their
boats are taking in coal—boats from India, China,
Japan, going and coming.
Port Said is justly celebrated for its donkeys.
They are the longest eared, mildest-eyed, and
most obstinate of their species.
Our ears were assailed on landing with the
shouts of the donkey-drivers
“ Here jei are, best donkey in Egypt.”
‘‘ Two lubby black eyes.”
‘‘ Lottie Collins, here y’are.”
‘‘Want a ride? Good donkey. Mrs. Langtry;
Sir Charles Dilke.”
Then a sharp boy ran up to me and said, “Here
y’ar, best donkey in Egypt. Srenrypark ! Won’t
y’hab a ride on Srenrypark ?”
I am a Protectionist. I said—“ Which is Sir
Henry ?”
He pointed him out, and I gazed on him with:
real curiosity. He was the most melancholy-
looking donkey I ever saw. If ever a donkey
wore a look of abject apology it was this one.
The irony had entered his soul. He looked up at
me with two great sad, pathetic eyes, containing
a soul-repding appeal. They might have called
him Pharaoh, or Moses, or Alexander, or Antony,
or Ptolemy, or Augustus, or even De Lesspps.
But he had been labelled Parkes. He felt it
keenly, and his knees trembled.
I hired him on the spot, and rode him full tilt
through the town, and up to the Arab quarters, >
with two small Arab boys belaboring him from
behind, and my long Australian legs trailing in
the desert sand. We saw the smellfnl mosque. I
had one soul-filling peep at the blue Mediterranean
and—in spirit—at the world of tradition, legend,
romance, gods and goddesses, beyond.
Then we rode back, all that was left of us, for,
one small Arab boy remained behind on the line
of route to fight another Arab boy of equal size.
It was only when I had dismounted and paid
that I discovered the imposture—Sir Henry
Parkes was of the female gender.
When I came through the canal, some six
months later, I saw Sir Henry again. She was
much altered in appearance, and appeared more
settled in her mind. The weight of care was lifted
from her brow, and she seemed as happy as any
other donkey.
This time she was called Mrs. Annie Besant
which, perhaps, accounted for the alteration.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-streot, Mel-
bourne. His ntvme has become almost literally a house-
hold word ; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life ; if you are suffering frop these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.
