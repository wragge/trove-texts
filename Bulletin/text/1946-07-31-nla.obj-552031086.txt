LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
The National Liberal Club.
A LTHOUGH the National Liberal Club was founded in 1882,
its palatial house in Whitehall Place was not opened until
June 20th, 1887, three years after W. E. Gladstone, the first
President of the Club, had laid the stone. The architect was Alfred
Waterhouse, R.A. The building houses the Gladstone Library
founded “as a permanent memorial of the services which the Right
Honorable W. E. Gladstone has rendered to his country.” The
library contained many thousands of political and historical works
and was one of London’s greatest, at the time of the Queen s
Jubilee. In the time of Queen Victoria, political receptions and
unofficial party meetings were held at the Club, which, however,
had no official status in the British Liberal party organisation.

"THE ROARING NINETIES."
Katharine Susannah Prichard’s The
Roaring Nineties (Cape; Australasian
Publishing Co.), a long novel stated to be
the first volume of a trilogy, is principally
concerned with the adventures of Sally
and Morris Gough, who bear a close re-
semblance to the Mary and Richard of
The Fortunes of Richard Mahony.
Sally, like Mary, is hardly a character
“in the round” ; or at any rate not in
herself an interesting person; a sort of
mythological embodiment of the Ideal
Wife. She is cheerful, - long-suffering,
loyal, democratic, virtuous and, in spite of
Katharine Prichard’s earnest attempts to
breathe life into her, colorless and syn-
thetic. The interest in such a character
is not the fascination of a richly indivi-
dual personality—such as, for instance,
Sarah Gamp—but simply in what hap-
pens to her. Since she is, essentially, a
dummy or lay-figure representing Every-
woman, every woman can identify her-
self to some extent with her experiences;
marriage, disillusion, temptation sternly
resisted, childbirth, the difficulties of a
hard life on the goldfields, the compensa-
tions, the gradual development of resist-
ance to —even domination over—the
husband ; and, in this case, the emergence
into an active interest in politics.
Sally, it should be said —insofar as her-
personality is worth discussing—is not
such a noodle as Henry Handel Richard-
son’s Mary; nor is she quite so deeply
sunk in those commonplaces of domestic
existence which (unless warmed by humor
or lit by drama; when they make the
richest material for the novel) remain
merely commonplace; life, perhaps, but
not art. But if Sally is livelier than
Mary, Morris is a much less interesting
creation than Richard Mahony.
For, as a compensation for the madden-
ing reiteration of Mahony’s madden-
ing weaknesses, Henry Handel Richard-
son does in the end reward the reader by
sending her hero mad. But Katharine
Prichard’s gentleman—unless she intends
to do more with him later —finishes in a
most peculiar way as a comparatively
contented and successful undertaker. It
may not be altogether kind to regard the
profession of undertaking as irresistibly
comic; but Katharine Prichard, though'
she does permit Morris a smile or two at
himself, is too much inclined at all times
to regard her characters as seriously as
they do themselves.
Morris, a stiffnecked Englishman—the
Honorable Morris Fitz-Morris Gough—
is really extraordinarily like Richard
Mahony. A victim like Mahony to
dreams of easy success, he has left
Sally behind to try his luck on the
goldfields and, on meeting her again,
is furious with her for having helped
with the work in a hotel:
“You’ve got a good home here when-
ever you want it, dartin’,” Mrs. Fogarty
called. “Bill’ll even give you a bath —
when we’ve had a drop more rain.”
“You needn’t wait for the rain, ma’am,
if that’s any inducement,” Bill called.
“Damned cheek,” Morris growled, whip-
ping up his lean horses. “For two pins
I’d drop the reins and go over and give
Bill Fogarty a piece of my mind.”
“Goodbye! Goodbye everybody!”
Sally cried, feeling a little weepy and sorry
to be leaving these kind people, although
she had known them only a few weeks.
“They’re so good-natured, Morris,” she
explained soothingly. “Only joking to
cheer me up.”
“I find jokes of that sort, about my wife,
in execrable taste,” Morris remarked coldly.
“You must not allow people to presume on
your lack of dignity, Sally. A woman’s
reputation up here is not worth a straw if
she permits any sort of familiarity.”
And into the inevitable coolness that
develops between Sally and Morris steps
the same sort of attractive scapegrace as
forms the third corner of the triangle in
Richard Mahony : Katharine Prichard’s
Frisco, interchangeable for Henry Handel
Richardson’s Purdy. Sally has not the
fantastic innocence of Mary—who en-
courages her admirer for months without
for one moment being aware that she is
attracted to him —but nonetheless she
rejects Frisco ; a most inartistic way to
behave, for —if one is to believe what the
author has told one of Sally’s charm —
the development of the story has made
it inevitable that they should be lovers.
It is inconceivable, really, that Frisco
should spend, as he does, years of his
time in pursuit of such a nonentity ; in-
conceivable, too, that Frisco should take
for his “mate” on goldseeking adventures
so wholly repellent a character as Morris.
For although we are told that Morris had
his moments of charm, he is never charm-
ing. Richard Mahony, meaning so well
and doing so foolishly, wins a measure of
sympathy that carries the reader’s interest
along through the vast trilogy ; but there
is no “sympathetic bridge” to Morris
Gough. He is a personality in a way
that Sally is not; but neither as a wholly
detestable character or as a man with his
moments of amiability is he fully realised,
fully projected.
Basically, the faults of The Roaring
Nineties are caused by the author’s mis-
taken approach to her art. The book is
less a novel than a history of the gold-
fields; and less a history in the end than
a political tract. Masses of raw material
gathered from historical research are
shovelled heedlessly into the story, not
only clogging the flow of the narrative
but robbing the author of both time and
space in which to develop her characters.
And for the sake of this material—for
the sake of political and documentary
interest —everything relating to art is most
ruthlessly sacrificed.
The writing itself (the novelist attack-
ing her own art at its very roots) is
damaged ; the dialogue is queerly clipped
prose that in a few passages of land
scape is smooth and lovely is broken to
a crude colloquialism or changed out o:
recognition into political journalese. Not
only are the principal characters unsatis-
factory, but minor characters —a black
girl named Maritana, an urchin namec
Paddy—who are very pleasantly port-
rayed are hardly ever on stage. Principal
and secondary narratives are alike dis-
jointed ; the construction a mere muddle
And the political and documentary writ-
ing is not even as interesting, for its own
sake as it should be ; told with such par-
tisanship, written so awkwardly, set *in
such a jumble.
It is the sociological and documentary
approach again that is responsible for the
introduction from time to time of a
narrator named Dinny, mentioned in the
foreword as an actual person who sup-
plied the author with much of her
material. Every time he is brought in as
narrator —“Dinny used to say,” “Dinny
said,” and so on —the novel loses all con-
viction as a work of art; in precisely the
way a stage play would if the author
walked on in the middle of the action
and announced, “This is a play I wrote”
or “Dinny told me it happened like this.”
There are, of course, patches of
genuine merit in the novel, glimpses of
the Katharine Prichard of old. There are
gay scenes, dramatic scenes, bits df good
prose and a great deal of interesting
history. A colorful film could be made
from it. But, on the whole, and be-
cause the directors would be forced to
use the artistic weapon of selection. The
Roaring Nineties provides one of the very
rare instances in which it would be better
to see the film than to read the book.
Linklafer's Italians.
All races are somewhat maligned in
war-time, but the Italians have been ac-
cused by friend and foe alike —who be-
came somewhat mixed in the latest war —
of being runners rather than fighters. In
Private Angelo (Australasian Publishing
Co.) Eric Linklater has chosen a hero
who is a speedier pedestrian than most.
The first words in the book show Angelo,
panting, as it were, after a brisk gallop,
and discussing the anatomy of courage
with his commanding officer.
“The trouble with you, Angelo,” said the
Count severely, “is that you lack the dono
di coraggio
Angelo frankly admits this fault;
pointing out that his lack of courage is
his great misfortune, for which he can
hardly be blamed. But the Count is stern.
Angelo is a soldier, he says, and it is his
duty to be brave. At that very moment,
perhaps, his comrades are driving the
English into the sea. And Angelo has run
all the way from Reggio to Rome.
Angelo replies that only his superior
fleetness of foot brought him to Rome
ahead of his comrades. Soon, if the
Count will only have patience, he will
see the rest of his command.
Having thus introduced Angelo and his
patron the Count (the two are, in reality,
the best of friends: the Count having
been at one time the lover of Angelo’s
mother), Linklater sets them off on
separate picaresque rounds of adventures.
They are pursued, imprisoned, involved
in affairs of the heart, shot at and
generally imperilled. Angelo, after a
time, finds himself back in Rome in
company with an old comrade-in-arms.
Sergeant Vespucci, who is a “Free Dis-
tributor.”
Everywhere in the streets there were
Romans who applauded the passing troops,
held their hands high and clapped them
loudly, tossed flowers into jeeps and tank
turrets, and boisterously demanded in ex-
change caramels and biscuits and cigarettes.
The Americans were hailed as actors in a
gala performance and responded very
graciously. Like artists bestowing their
autographs they threw cigarettes, caramels
and biscuits. Sergeant Vespucci complained
loudly about this prodigality.
In brief, there are the major elements
of comedy, or tragedy. The American
conquerors, the Italian crowd, Angelo
the observer and Vespucci the black-
marketeer. But Vespucci is the merest
shadow of a person, a vehicle for Link-
later’s whimsicalities. And that, of
course, is Linklater’s major failing. He
seldom creates character, only vehicles.
And when their cargo is truly funny all
is well. But of late years Linklater’s
writing has fallen away from the high
risible quality of his early books, reveal-
ing, when he tries to be serious, that he
is not really a master of character, or
even a good journeyman of prose. But
his peculiar gift is the ridiculous, and
there, at his best, he is inimitable.
Private Angelo is not nearly as funny
as Juan in America. But there are
flashes that show Linklater is taking
steps back towards his early style.
One of the virtues of the admirable Juan
was the unexpected little scenes one
stumbled upon, by chance almost, as the
hero wandered around the U.S.A. And
here, again, only a few lines away from
the picture of the generous G.ls. in
jeeps, Angelo and his businesslike friend
come upon another spectacle—a group
of American generals on a balcony con
fearing.
“What are they looking for on their
maps? asked Angelo. “Do they not know
where they are?”
“It is always the same with generals”
said the sergeant. “They and -their man’s
they are like a woman with her knitting’
When there is nothing else to do. out it
comes.”
There was a sudden commotion in the
small crowd as two cars drove up and
from them, before they had stopped, sprang
a dozen men so fierce of aspect, so pon-
derous yet quick in movement—they ran
with a jungle-stoop—that Angelo caught
his breath in a momentary gasp of fear
Some of the photographers, disdaining
the marble staircase, ran up the balus-
trade that curved like an elevated bow
high above the fountain, and presented
their cameras at the generals on the bal-
cony as if they had been highwaymen and
were holding them to ransom. The generals
affected disregard of their presence but
assumed a more intense interest in their
maps Then, to placate the photographers
who had arrived by the normal route they
turned attractive profiles in their direction
and put on expressions of sapient authority.
Then, when Angelo’s mind is still full
of the photographers, their bloodshot
eyes, and maniacal expressions, and long
simian arms, he hears a voice behind him,
turns, and lo! it is his old friend and
patron the Count, fresh from the dun-
geons and full of great tales. And that,
of course, is always the way of things in
picaresque novels.
But in all good books of the kind there
are also hosts of fleeting characters whom
the hero comes across a few times only,
or, perhaps, once. There is General
Hammerfurter, for instance, to whom
Angelo becomes tutor.
With his native regard for order and
authority, the general preferred the smooth-
ness of monologue to the ragged give-
and-take of ordinary conversation, and
rarely would he consider any topic not
of his own choosing. “I wish to explain
myself to you,” he would say. “I have a
remarkable character, and you will be
deeply interested to hear about it. I am,
for instance, equally capable of tragic per-
ception and Homeric laughter. Intrinsically
I am a nobleman, very simple and honest
and kind-hearted, a true aristocrat of the
old sort'. But also I have a modern under-
standing so subtle that often I am amazed
at myself. But how German! you will say.
For you, being intelligent yourself, know
how typical of the German soul is its uni-
versality. How do you say, in Italian, ‘the
universality of the German soul’?”
Linklater appears to enjoy writing
about Germans. Sometimes the satire is
somewhat heavy-handed ; still, it serves,
and the pictures of a type of zealous Ger-
man are faithful, beneath their exaggera-
tion.
But Linklater seems incapable of
viewing Englishmen engaged in the
solemn and patriotic business of waging
\*ar with a humorous and unprejudiced
eye. A Captain—or Major—Telfer, for
whom Angelo conceives an extravagant
admiration quite out of keeping with his
character, is a typical artificial product.
Resembling, as much as anything, a cross
between the most romantic of Buchan’s
hearty young English aristocrats (Buchan
himself was Scotch and middle-class: and
although he had, for a time, been a man
of action, an incurable and naive
romanticism kept creeping into the best
of his work) and Lord Peter Wimsey, the
creation of some minor British novelist.
Private Angelo is essentially a book
about Italians. And none of his Italians
really approaches the Italians in Eve
Langley’s Pea Pickers. Nor, on the whole,
is the portrait of Angelo comparable
with that of the Italian in “The Enthusi-
astic Prisoner,” a short story by E. 0.
Schlunke published in The Bulletin
last year. Another Schlunke story,
“Around the Traps,” also deals with an
Italian, in character somewhat similar to
Angelo. So, it would seem, in Australian
literature we have a special interest in
Italians. And this, of course, is fitting.
They gave a good deal of vividness and
humor to a great native novel, and
during the war our troops saw something
of them in the Middle East and stay-at-
home folks saw something more of them,
particularly in the country districts. And
with all marks given to humor and fan-
tastic situations, it must be stated that
Linklater has failed. Partly, perhaps, be-
cause he has made Angelo too obviously
a national type. A poltroon, something
of an artist and a lover. When he is freed
from all warrior duties Angelo settles
down quite comfortably with two fair
women, and is visited by his old friend
the Count, who has become a sewing-
machine salesman. And there Linklater
should have been content. But, feeling
perhaps that the general and national
Italian typified by Angelo has not been
given a fair showing l —after all he is a
co-belligerent—Linklater tries to prove,
by some very specious reasoning, that
Angelo has the dono di coraggio after
all, since he is setting up house so opti-
mistically. And that, true or false of
the nation, is a mistake about Angelo,
and a mistake in this novel.

S. H. PRIOR PRIZE
AWARD FOR 1946.
The S. H. Prior Memorial Prize for 1946 goes to BRIAN JAMES for
his collection of short stories “COOKABUNDY BRIDGE.”
Brian James receives £lOO, leaving £2OO to be carried forward, so that
with the annual £lOO from the fund added, the total prizemoney available
for next year will be £3OO.
Conditions for the 1947 award will be the same as for 1946; that is,
no submission of manuscripts is called for, but the Prize will be awarded
to the author of the book considered by the trustees to be the outstanding
contribution to Australian literature published in Australia between June 7,
1946, and June 6, 1947. As before, the terms “Australian” and “Australia,”
for the purposes of the award, include New Zealand. The total prize-
money may be awarded to one book or may be divided among two or
three, but in no circumstances will the award be less than £lOO. If no
work considered of sufficient merit is published, no award will be made,
the prizemoney in that case being carried forward and added to the next
year’s award.
Previous winners of the Prize have been: 1935, Kylie Tennant
(“Tiburon”); 1936, Miles Franklin {“All That Swagger”); 1939, Miles
Franklin {“Who Was Joseph Furphy ?”); 1940, Eve Langley {“The Pea
Pickers”), M. H. Ellis {“Lachlan Macquarie”), Kylie Tennant {“The
Battlers”); 1941, Gavin Casey {“lfs Harder for Girls”); 1945, Douglas
Stewart {“The Fire on the Snow”). •
Brian James’s prizewinner should not be confused with “The Coqka-
bundy Chronicles,” a later work now running in short-story form through
The Bulletin. “Cookabundy Bridge” is a collection of short stories
written over the last four or five years. It is a richly humorous work,
bulking as large as a novel, and as distinctively Australian as Henry
Lawson’s stories or “Such Is Life.”

ON AUGUST 6th
We hail with pride our Anniversary. $
In years, we long since passed our century,
Numbering to-day a further twenty-three;
And many useful decades still foresee.
With institutions, as with men, the test
Of worthy life is not self-interest,
But how we may give others of our best:
Our talents for the general good invest.
This to have done, is to have lived full well,
As countless records of man’s progress tell;
And though none may a happy fate compel,
With honour, truth, fair dealing, all may dwell.
With service to our fellows as our creed,
We pledge our energies to meet their need;
And in a world from war’s encroachments freed.
Trust that our work may prosper and succeed.

Some information about the “free selection
without survey” law?
John Robertson when first elected to the
N.S.W. Parliament in 1858 was an advocate of
free selection over all public lands. While he
was a private member he endeavored to have
inserted in a land bill a clause providing for
free selection over all land “surveyed or un-
surveyed.” This move received little support
and was abortive. Later he became Minister
for Lands in the Cowper Ministry of 1858.
In 1860 there was a dissolution and Robertson
appealed to the people in favor of “free selec-
tion without survey.” After his election his two
measures “for regulating the alienation of
Crown lands” and “for regulating the occupa-
tion of Crown lands” were carried. He suc-
ceeded in excluding any limitation of selection
to proclaimed agricultural areas; Robertson re-
signed his seat in the Assembly and went to the
Upper House in order to advocate his bills
there and pilot them through safely. They
received the Royal Assent in October, 1861.

Some facts about the ancient Druids?
They were priests of the old Celtic races of
Gaul, Britain and Ireland, and their religion
was made up of nature worship, symbolism
and a belief in special deities. These Druids
were greatly venerated by the people and,
in addition to matters of religion, were en-
trusted with the administration of justice. They
regarded the oak as the symbol of the Supreme
Being, while the mistletoe was held to represent
man’s dependence upon God. Human sacrifices
were part of their religion, and the serpent was
one of the objects of their worship. Stone-
henge and other circles of huge stones are held
to be Druidical remains.

Some information about the Colosseum ?
This amphitheatre at Rome was begun by
Vespasian and finished by Titus in a.d. 80.
It is 607 ft. long, 512 ft. broad and 159 ft. high.
On the ground storey there are 80 vaulted
openings. In the arena of this structure gladia-
torial displays and mimic naval battles took
place before 87,000 people.

Meaning of the term “brachycephalic” ? .
A term applied to skulls the breadth of which
is more than eight-tenths of the length. The
heads of most individuals of civilised races are
brachycephalic, and the development of width
in comparison with length in the skull has been
generally taken to indicate increasing brain de-
velopment.

(1) What is a picaresque novel ? (2) Meaning
of picaro ?
(1) The autobiography of a real or fictitious
personage who describes his experiences as a
wandering parasite, and who satirises the society
which he has exploited. The type is Spanish,
but the most widely-known example is the
French Gil Bias. (2) Spanish for vagabond.

(1) What is the Koran? (2) What doc-

(1) The holy book of Mohammedanism, a
record of the revelations given to Mohammed
by Allah and compiled after the prophet’s death
by his secretary, Zaid-ibn-Thabit, by order of
the Caliph Abu Bekr. The earliest scripts are
in Arabic, and consist of 114 suras or chapters,
which are arranged according to size, the
longest first. (2) The chief doctrine is Unitarian
—one God, one true faith (Mohammedanism)
and a day of judgment. The Koran concedes
Moses and Christ rank as prophets, but lower
than Mohammed.

What is the reason for the variation in the
spelling of the Christian names of Governor
King, his son (the explorer ) and his grandson?
Captain Philip Gidley King, R.N. (1758-1808),
Governor of N.S.W. from September, 1800, to
August, 1806, and his grandson Philip Gidley
King (1817-1904) both spelt their first Christian
name with one “1.” Governor King’s son,
Phillip Parker King (1791-1856), the explorer,
was christened “Phillip” because of his father s
great admiration for the Governor of that
name.

What are the Magellanic clouds?
Two oval cloudlike patches of nebulous fight
near the Southern Pole of the heavens, named
by the navigator Andrea Corsali after Magel-
lan. The major is in the constellation Dorado,
and the minor is situated in a blank space be-
tween Hydrus and Toucan. The greater number
of the variable stars of the heavens is found
in these clouds. The greater nebula covers an
area of about 42 square degrees, and the lesser
about 10 square degrees.

In agony writhed
And sank from view.

Although government ownership in Australia
has proved a costly blunder, more and more
activities are coming under government control.
If this socialisation continues, the day will come
when everything, from shoes to ships, will be
government owned. We’ll find ourselves
regimented employees, wearing, eating, read-
ing, doing what bureaucrats dictate. Initiative
and ability would be curbed, individual liberty
crippled ... if government ownership were
allowed to go its full socialistic way.
THE LIBERAL PARTY will put national
interest before nationalisation . . . Australian
liberty before bureaucratic dictatorship,,
The Liberal Party believes in equality of oppor-
tunity and the development of free enterprise.
It maintains that healthy competition is the life
blood of business; that industries, large and
small, should be encouraged without the fear
of government intrusion.
A LIBERAL GOVERNMENT will stop
unwarranted interference with individual and national

FLASH FELLOW
By STANDBY
AT the Lower
Crossing Con-
st a b 1 e Roy
Hardy sat
down at the foot of
a cabbage-gum and
waited. He had
never visited the
blacks’ camp, but he
knew it was across the stream, less than
half a mile away. Two things prevented
him from approaching it yet; the tide
was out, and the wind was blowing the
wrong way. If Big Albert was expecting
him, it would be at low-tide, when the
crossing was only knee-deep. Once the
tide swirled up these mudflats the risk
of being taken by a shark or a crocodile
prevented even the blacks from crossing.
As for the wind —the land breeze was
blowing now, straight from the camp.
Constable Hardy knew blacks and their
habits. They might all be sleeping
soundly, but blackfellows’ dogs never
really slept. Some half-starved cur would
seen! him before he got anywhere near
the camp and start a yapping and snarling
that would arouse every black for miles.
Some time between now and dawn the
breeze would change—it always did —
and blow gently in from the sea. It
might come in half an hour or it might
not come until an hour before dawn;
but come it would. Better to wait for it
than risk working round to the other
side of the camp, and being caught by
the change of wind.
For hours he sat there, slapping at
mosquitoes and listening to the noises of
the night. Hoarse croaking of frogs,
eerie, plaintive calls of curlews, rustlings
and whirrings and, above all, the un-
ceasing thin whining of mosquitoes.
SOONER or later, it was inevitable that
he should fall foul of Big Albert, he
thought. When he first came to Wandoo,
a small, one-pub, one-store town over a
hundred miles north of Cooktown, most
of the local lawbreakers took him for
an easy mark. He grinned so easily.
And, lean and brown, he looked like an
average casual bushman. But he put an
end to Steve’s cattle-duffing, and he
forced old Ben to close his sly-grog
business and depart for another district,
two things his predecessor had never been
able to do. Cut he had been warned
about Big Albert, who had considerable
fame.
Big Albert was a three-quarter blood
abo. and ugly. Flat nose, bloodshot eyes,
thick lips and a look of arrogance. He
was powerfully built, and for a year he
had toured the country shows down south
with a boxing trdupe, pitting his strength
and cunning against rough-and-tumble
bush fighters. When he came back to the
Gulf Country he was undisputed cham-
pion of the north, a flash blackfellow who
could, and did, boast that he had belted
every white man he had fought. He
worked when he felt like it.
For three months after he came to
Wandoo Constable Hardy had seen no-
thing of Big Albert, who was away
droving.
Big Albert appeared in town one
Friday afternoon, trailed by an admiring,
not unattractive gin. A half-caste piob-
ably, Constable Hardy thought, judging
by the paleness of her skin and the regu-
larity of her features.
Constable
Hardy, leaning
against the ver-
andah post of
Harrison’s store,
studied the pair.
Big Albert
walked a little in
advance of the
woman, strutting.
No doubt about
it. Big Albert was
“flash fella.” He wore grey jodhpurs and a
white silk shirt On his head was a large
black sombrero tilted forward over one
eye at an excessively rakish angle and
from the heels of his tight elastic-side
boots a pair of bright, long-necked spurs
trailed, kicking up spurts of dust- and
leaving grooves in the soft ground as he
walked.
By comparison the policeman was
small and shabby. His khaki shirt and
trousers needed pressing and he was recog-
nisable as a policeman only by the police
force badge and the light pugaree on his
ancient felt hat. Big Albert nodded, a
condescending, contemptuous nod, and
tossed a “Gooday” in the manner of a
personage acknowledging the presence of
an inferior. His bloodshot eyes took
stock of the policeman and his thick lips
curled into a sneer. Constable Hardy
ignored the greeting.
“That’s Big Albert ,” Harrison informed
him in a hoarse whisper. “He’s a bad
nigger, that bloke. You want to look
out for him.”
“If there’s anyone who wants to do any
looking out in this town,” Constable
Hardy announced, not bothering to lower
his.voice, “it won’t be me.”
This town’s not big enough to hold
that nigger and me, he told himself as he
walked back to the police station. 1
think Big Albert’ll be leaving before long.
He had a visitor that afternoon. Tail,
good-natured Geoff Sutherland, manager
of Saltern Downs station, arrived in look-
ing as if he’d been in a bad smash. One
eye was black and completely closed and
there were several strips of sticking plaster
across his face.
“That bloody nigger!” he spluttered.
“I’ll get him if I have to take a gun and
blow”
“Take it easy,” Constable Hardy
soothed. “What about telling me what
happened before you start any shooting?”
AFTER a lot of preliminary cursing
Sutherland explained. Big Albert, he
said, called in at the station on his way
back from his droving trip. He was
riding one horse and leading another and,
without asking the Boss’s permission, had
let them go in the horse paddock and
camped the night. Sutherland knew no-
thing of this until the following morning
when Timmy, one of his best blackboys,
came up to the homestead with a long
tale of woe. Big Albert had picked a
quarrel with him and, after givmg him
a hell of a belting, had camped the night
with Stella, Timmy’s wife. Worse still,
Timmy wailed. Big Albert \yas taking
Stella away with him. They were over
at the horse yard now, saddling up.
Timmy was a mission boy and had
married Stella at the mission church in
proper “white fella fashion,” but Suther-
land was more annoyed at this big black-
fellow making free with the station hospi-
tality without even asking for it than he
was at the theft of a gin. Evidently the
girl was going with him quite willingly,
but Big Albert wasn’t going to blow
along and treat station property as if he
owned it.
He should have known better but he
was too annoyed to think clearly. He
reached the horse yard just as Big Albert
was girthing up and angrily demanded
what the hell the nigger thought he was
doing. Big Albert was quick. He
dropped the girth, spun round and hit
in one swift movement. The fight didn’t
last long.
“But I’ll get him! ” Sutherland finished.
“No nigger’s going to do that to me and
get away with it.”
“Take it easy,” Constable Hardy
repeated. “This is my job now. I’ll
handle this buck.”
“Right-oh; I’ll give you a hand. I’m
in on this, too.”
“You stay right out of it, Mr. Suther-
land.” Constable Hardy was grinning
easily. “You’ve had your whack and I’ll
probably want you as a witness when I
bring him in.”
“You’re not going after him by your-
self, are you?”
“Yes,”
“He’il eat you; belt the socks off you.”
“I don’t think so. Unless I’m slipping
badly I’ll have your man in here tomorrow
morning. Don’t say anything about it and
if anyone asks you what happened to
your face say your horse ran you into a
tree.”
“Some tree,” Sutherland growled.
“Right-oh, Hardy. I’ll be waiting for
you.”
At ten o’clock that evening Constable
Hardy, armed only with a pair of hand-
cuffs, had closed the police station and
started off on foot. A rough bush road
led in the direction he wanted to go but
he kept well off it. There was just a
chance that he mightn’t succeed tonight
and he was leaving no telltale tracks in
the dust. For three miles he followed the
tidal creek, taking care to keep on the
grassy ground above high-water mark,
till, finally, he reached the cabbage-
gum, where he now waited for the change
of wind and tide.
AT last the moon rose, and with it
came the tide. The man in the
shadow of the cabbage-gum watchad the
steadily-widening stream, listened to the
plop-plop of leaping fish. In the distance
a blackfellow’s dog greeted the moon, a
high-pitched mournful howl, ending in a
long, quivering note. Then the sea-
breeze came, and Constable Hardy
stripped. Holding his clothes over his
head he waded in.
The water was up to his chin in mid-
stream. It soothed his mosquito bites,
but he was glad when he was safely
ashore on the far bank. Fighting off the
hordes of mosquitoes that attacked his
wet, naked body he dressed and moved
quietly off, placing each foot carefully to
avoid the slightest noise. The grass was
knee-high here, and the trunks of the
cabbage gums shone white and ghostly
in the moonlight.
A few hundred yards further on the
timber thinned out and the long grass
ended. Constable Hardy paused and
sniffed. The camp was close now ; he
could smell the faint odor of blacks and
the tang of smoke from their fires. Drop-
ping to his hands and knees he worked
his way cautiously to a stunted bush.
Very slowly he stood up. He was in sight
of the camp now,
a collection of
miserable bark
gunyahs. Here and
there the dying
embers of fire
glowed dully. But
in between him
and the nearest
gunyah he saw
what he was look-
ing for —a white
oblong patch. For the first time since
he’d left the township Constable Hardy
grinned with real pleasure.
That white patch was a mosquito net,
one of the camp nets used by all bush-
men in the North. No ordinary black
would use one, but Big Albert would; it
would be just another way of showing
his superiority to his newly acquired
bride. One other thing the policeman
noted. The morning star was just show-
ing above the tree-tops. Daylight was
not far off and there was no time to be
lost.
With the care and silence of the wildest
myall he wriggled forward, handcuffs in
hand, until he was within three feet of the
net. A light snoring told him where the
heads were and he dived. His shoulder
tore through the net and he landed on top
of two naked bodies. He smelt the stale,
bitter smell of unwashed blackfellow,
heard a startled grunt drowned by the
shrill squealing of the gin, and the hand-
cuffs were on, not in the orthodox place
certainly, but exactly where he intended
them to be. Tearing the net from his
head and shoulders he scrambled up and
stepped back.
Big Albert was on his feet in another
second, and for a man rudely awakened
from a sound sleep he acted with amaz-
ing speed. He took a half step forward
and led with his left. It was a wicked,
carefully acquired straight left that had
floored many a man, but this time it
missed and, without realising why, Big
Albert fell forward. He didn’t fall all the
way. Constable Hardy saw to that. He
stopped the big blackfellow’s fall with
two beautifully timed hits to the face.
Instead of falling Big Albert sank to
his knees, but he was by no means beaten.
Stella was wailing in terror, but as her
partner scrambled to his feet her wails
rose to a piercing shriek. Once more Big
Albert lunged forward and once more
Constable Hardy scored two hits before
his man crashed to the ground. Dogs
were barking and snarling now, gins were
cackling like excited hens and the whole
camp was in an uproar. A snarling
mongrel flew at Constable Hardy and was
stopped by a well-aimed kick. It landed
on top of Big Albert and took its
revenge by sinking its teeth in the
exposed bare buttocks of that sadly in-
jured man. Big
Albert added his
yells to the uproar.
It was only then
that he discovered
the real cause of his
downfall. The des-
pised new “John”
had him well and
truly hobbled, his right ankle securely
handcuffed to Stella’s left leg. He couldn’t
move without her, and Stella showed no
inclination to move. She lay on the
ground, hugging the tattered remains of
the mosquito net around her naked body,
wailing as only a gin can wail. The whole
camp, from the oldest buck down to the
smallest piccaninny, had gathered round
by now.
In the cold light of the approaching
dawn they recognised the Law in the
wiry figure of the new policeman and
kept back. Not one of them had any
intention of interfering, not only because
they feared the law, but because they did
not approve of Big Albert’s latest
escapade in bringing another man’s lubra
into their camp.
Constable Hardy touched Big Albert
with the toe of his boot.
“Get up, you;” he ordered. “I want
you.”
Big Albert silenced Stella with a hefty
clout on the side of the head.
“Shut up,” he snarled between rapidly
swelling, bleeding lips, “You altogether
talk too much.” Seizing her by the hair
he dragged her to her feet.
Constable Hardy stepped back a couple
of paces and said, “Come here.”
"THE handcuffed pair shuffled awk-
• wardly forward, stumbled and
straightened up facing the police-
man. From somewhere in the audi-
ence a gin’s laugh sounded, a high
nervous cackle. Another and then an-
other joined in until the whole camp was
laughing with the shrill infectious laugh
of the aborigine. Constable Hardy looked
at his victims and grinned. Things were
turning out even better than he’d hoped.
Ridicule would hurt Big Albert more than
a six-months’ term in jail. He would
never live this down. And no wonder
the camp laughed at the spectacle of this
hobbled pair—Big Albert, black, naked
and massive, the half defiant scowl on his
ugly face completely spoiled by his cut
lips and one fast closing eye, and Stella,
lighter of skin, wailing, cowering and
frantically trying to hide her nakedness
behind her escort.
But Big Albert was no gallant knight
wishful only to shield his lady love. He
swung a backhander that caught her
across the mouth and knocked her sprawl-
ing. Unfortunately for him her fall
brought him down too. The camp was
delighted ; the laughter rose to an even
higher pitch. This was the best they’d
seen for years. Constable Hardy found
himself joining in and checked hia
laughter abruptly. He walked over to the®
wrecked nuptial couch and examined the
few articles ■of clothing. It was light
enough to see everything clearly now.
Big Albert’s white silk shirt was there,
and also a scrap of printed material that
must be Stella’s frock. He kicked the
two garments towards his captives.
“Put ’em on,” he ordered.
Still whimpering Stella slipped the
frock over her head. She was decently
clad now but not so Big Albert. The
morning breeze kept fluttering his shut
up around his waist.
“The trouser, boss,” he pleaded meekly.
“Gibbit trouser.”
“Never mind the
trouser,” Constable
Hardy snapped,
struggling to keep a
straight face. “You’ll
do like that. Now
get going, the two of
you. Straight up to
the police station.”
It was after break-
fast time when they
reached the township.
Either Sutherland
had not kept his word or someone had
spotted them coming, for the entire male
population was gathered outside the pub
when the trio passed. If the laughter
was not as loud as it had been in the
blacks’ camp it was only because the
blacks outnumbered the whites by three
to one.
Big Albert stumbled along ’ in an
attempt to suit his stride to Stella’s. One
eye was closed completely. The other
glared, bloodshot and sullen at the ground
in front of him.

“DANGER TO PEACE.”
(Condensed from a N.Y. "Times” article.)
All free and honest elections in Europe
ftave demonstrated that the European
peoples are at one in holding fast, in their
great majority, to the traditional political
and ethical values that have created
modern European civilisation. And the
greatest of these values are liberty and
ie dignity ot man.
ihis choice was guaranteed to them by
war-time pronouncements of the United
Rations and wherever the Western
rowers have any influence that guarantee
as been redeemed. But, to use the
words ot Winston Churchill, there is be-
hind an iron curtain a broad band of
rrit / P I ] I<^ s stretching from the Baltic to
Adriatic and containing nearly one-
mird ot Europe s population, apart from
Russia, as well as the great capitals of
.astern and Central Europe, where that
is not the case—where, as in Hungary,
tic will ot the people already registered
is being nullified, and where instead of
P®, P r o mise d democracy there are being
installed new totalitarian police Govern-
ments as tyrannical as those we fought to
overthrow.
inis is m itself a danger to peace,
Ihere is no reason to assume that the
people ot these ancient States and nations
are less eager for or less capable of de-
mocracy than are the peoples of India,
Indonesia or Korea, or other hitherto
dependent regions now seeking self-gov-
eminent. And there is even less reason
to underestimate their stamina or their
vitality. Though still suffering from the
war, they are bound to strain against
their new shackles as they have strained
against past ones through the centuries,
In some countries, as in Poland and
Yugoslavia, they are already astir, and
are either in open conflict with the new
regimes or are biding their time for a
better opportunity to strike. There is no
need for further proof that any European
conflict has the tendency to spread.
This whole region is being ruled or
actively directed by Russia, which has ad-
vancfed her frontier to the Elbe and the
Adriatic, and is Sovietising and integrating
the regions east of it into her own poli-
tical and economic system. It is this
which is spreading new anxiety through-
out the world. Mr. Churchill, with the
force of the prophet proved right before
has charged openly that it is in Eastern
Europe, if anywhere, that the seeds of a
new world war are being sown, and sown
by Russia. In uttering these words he
merely voiced the fears of the whole
Western world.
JAP RETURN TO ASIAN MARKETS.
(From an article by a Manchsester "Guardian" special correspondent.)
Before the war the' Japanese had, of
courp, a lion’s share in the imports of
South-east Asia, and the appetite of their
exporters grew with eating.
Ihis was not all at the expense of rivals,
It was to some extent the creation of new
and veiy cheap markets. There is today,
all over South-east Asia as elsewhere, a
desperate shortage of things to buy. If
rice production as a cash crop is to be
encouraged and tin and rubber are to
come back, then there must be a corres-
ponding increase of imports on which the
cultivators and miners can spend their
money. How far will this demand be
met if Japan does not return to something
hke her old activity in export trade?
How far can Lancashire gain? Is it desir-
able from anyone’s point of view that
Japan should be kept down?
These points are keenly debated all
over South-east Asia. People whose first
thought is of war insist that Japan must
never again be allowed to become an in-
dustrial nation. Others reply by pointing
out that the Japanese population is much
too large and is increasing much too fast
for it to escape starvation unless it has the
money to pay for imported food—which
means, of course, having an export trade,
Emigration from Japan on a large scale
is ruled out because nobody would accept
the emigrants. Increased food produc-
tion within the islands is also ruled out
as being impossible on an adequate scale
for reasons of soil and climate. Nobody
is optimistic about the chances of birth-
control really affecting the issue A
visitor turns his back on Singapore con-
vinced that the majority of responsible
British observers from there to Hong-
Kong accept as inevitable Japan’s re-entry
into all South-east Asian markets within
five years at the most.
U.S. CONGRESS REPORT ON RUSSIA.
(From a report by an equal group of Republican and Democrat Congress members who visited
and travelled extensively in Russia.)
From our studies, travels and observa-
tions in Russia, the following facts seem
to be demonstrably clear: —-
The military outlay of the Russian Gov-
ernment continues on a huge scale. They
are embarking upon a programme of ex-
panding the heavier industries to the
neglect of the manufacture and procure-
ment of goods for domestic consumption.
It has become very evident in Moscow
tfhat each time we [U.S.] have taken a
Rtiffer attitude and refused to yield to
every Soviet demand our Embassy has
found it increasingly easier to deal with
Russian officials. In the Politbureau there
are those who are more favorable than
others to the United States. Each time we
yield we lay them open to ridicule and
give the others cause to argue that talking
tough to America is the most productive
policy. Thus by appeasement we alienate
those who are most friendly toward us
within the Government group in the
Kremlin.
The present leaders of Russia are a
group of exceedingly able and extremely
self-confident men, who evidence no dis-
position whatsoever to depart in any
degree from the established Communistic
system. They are concerning themselves
first of all with keeping an iron control
over the populace lest the first symptoms
of possible discontent should grow, in-
creased by the contacts their armies have
had with the easier ways of living in the
capitalistic countries. The present Gov-
ernment in Russia is a dictatorship com-
plete and effective. The Russian leaders
freely admit that the brand of Com-
munism now prevailing in Russia is a
marked departure from the theoretical
concepts of the Communism preached by
Marx. The evolution of today’s Com-
munistic methods was described to us as
follows by one of the top officials: “Marx
gave the ideology, Lenin interpreted it,
and Stalin is applying it and making of it
a Russian phenomenon.”
In direct response to a question we
asked Mr, Vishinsky, he told us that there
are 5,000,000 Communists in Russia,
This means there are 185,000,000 non-
Communists, since the present population
of the pre-war borders of Russia is
190,000,000. The Communist party is
the ruling class of Russia. It operates
under the direction of the Polit-
bureau, composed of 14 men, who in-
elude Stalin. The Politbureau through
its representatives in the Communist
party controls the entire administrative
machinery of the [Soviet] Empire.
Russia today is definitely being operated
as a tightly policed State. Freedom as
we understand it does not exist in the
U.S.S.R. In complete opposition to the
concept of freedom dedicated, as ours
is, to the theory that the individual is of
importance, that his rights as an indi-
vidual shall be protected against inter-
ference even from his Government, and
that he shall have the right to criticise and
to oppose the Administration in power,
the present “Russian phenomenon” con-
trols all things with an iron hand.
The Communist party as the ruling
class of Russia provides many special
privileges for its members. Conspicuous
among these is the price-system which
operates in the State-owned stores where
non-rationed goods are sold. This carries
down from Politbureau members through
the military, the theatre, the scientists,
etc., to the lowest-paid worker, and
creates new and severe class divisions.
The system of stores now operating is
as follows; All are owned and operated
by the State:
(a) The ration store: This is the so-called
closed store, operated by the Government,
and to which the workers go with their ration
books. Prices are cheap in these stores but
supplies are limited. Workers in many dif-
ferent industries and categories have stores
designated as the ones in which they are sup-
posed to trade.
(£>) The commercial store: This is the so-
called open store, which is a new develop-
ment and part of the mechanics by means of
which a definite system of class distinctions
is developing in Russia. These were not
opened until April, 1944, and evidence rather
dramatically the changes that are developing
under Stalin’s application of Lenin’s interpre-
tation of the Marx theories. It is in these *
stores that the privileged classes Carrying dis-
count cards are able to buy mercandise
much more cheaply than those having no
such discount cards. One of the unannounced
reasons for these stores is to provide a means
for siphoning the excess roubles circulating
in the country back into the hands of the
Government; thus prices arei extremely high
in these stores for people without Govern-
ment discount cards.
(c) The peasants’ market: This is the open
market or a so-called Government-run black-
market where people are permitted to sell to
one another from stalls or stands rented from
the State. The prices in this market are
usually a little bit above those of the com-
mercial store so as to encourage people to
buy things at the commercial store. N.K.V.D.
[secret police] men circulate around among
the throngs to see to it "that goods are not
being purchased for resale, or from stands
not rented officially.
(d) The commission store: Here people
can list second-hand merchandise for sale
and by paying a 15 per cent, commission as
a brokerage fee to the Government they can
sell their second-hand supplies to other people.
(e) In the peasants’ market, we found a
crowded, cold, damp, muddy place with un-
tidy stalls where were displayed good-looking
carrots, tomatoes, cabbages, potatoes, cucum-
bers and so forth, as well as bread, eggs and

dispose of as he pleased.

ously supplied with every sort and description

ated came to recognise that they must
develop professional, scientific, artist,

We, therefore, find there is an intricate
system of incentive payments not only in
the factories, but on all levels,

THERE WAS A CASE FOR MIHAILOVICH.
(Condensed from an American “Mercury” article by Walter R. Mansfield. During the war
Mansfield served as a U.S. Marine Corps captain in the Office of Strategic Services [O.S.S.] and
after parachuting in to Nazi-held Yugoslavia spent six months with Mihailovich.)
During 1942-43 Mihailovich was
acclaimed as a gallant patriot who fought
on with his Chetnik guerrillas against
Nazi occupation forces despite all odds,
when the rest of the world was verging
on collapse under Axis pressure. Sud-
denly, in September, 1943, he was
dropped in favor of the Communist
guerrilla-leader Tito.
Why this about-face? America has
never heard the truth of the matter,
Yet from 1943 until December, 1944,
when the charges against Mihailovich
were first being made, there were several
American O.S.S. missions with him. All
of them travelled widely and unhampered
through guerrilla-held regions of Serbia
and Bosnia; unlike Tito, Mihailovich
urged them to make wide contacts with
the Yugoslav people everywhere. What
facts did these Americans find?
They found that in April, 1941, the
Nazis had blitzkrieged Yugoslavia in a
quick conquest facilitated by treacherous
Croats who deserted the Yugoslav Army
for German promises of an independent
Croatia, Mihailovich, a well-educated
Serbian colonel, was in charge of one unit
on the Bosnian front. He, along with
thousands of others, fled to the woods
and mountains determined to keep on
fighting as best he could. During May
and June, 1941, the Nazi occupation
forces, joined by treacherous Croats and
Ustachi, who were determined to wipe
out any thought of resistance on the part
of this liberty-loving people, carried out
one of the greatest blood massacres in
history. Hardly a Serb family did not
lose at least one member.
Great numbers of Serb peasants with-
drew to join the soldiers in the w^oos-

Mifiailovich, commanding one unit in the
hills of Ravne Gora, gradually became
recognised as their leader. After organis-
ing them, he struck back with a ven-
geance, and during the balance of 1941
and 1942 his men used their rescued arms
to attack German garrisons throughout
central Serbia and elsewhere, destroying
enemy communication lines and then be-
sieging whole cities, such as Valjevo and
Kraguevac. This timely resistance sapped
the Nazis’ drive into Russia by forcing
the Germans to divert troops to the Bal-
kans.
During this period, when Rommel was
in Egypt and Bataan had fallen, the only
Allied aid Mihailovich received was loud
cheers. Possessing inadequate arms, liv-
ing off the land and freezing in their now-
tattered uniforms, his men were finally
stopped by systematic German counter-
attacks. Once again the Serbs were deci-
mated by Nazi reprisals and the taking of
thousands of innocent hostages. Mihailo-
vich had learned his lesson. Henceforth
his programme would be to try to hold
his organisation together—midst these
hardships—until the great D-day (“Jus-
tanek”) when the Allies, preparatory to
invading Europe, would send him arms.
After Russia was attacked Tito
organised some of the Yugolsav Com-
munists, now called “Partisans,” and
started a campaign for control of the
loosely organised Chetniks. His guerrillas
began to attack Chetnik groups in an
attempt to take over or disrupt them.
British missions, to which Americans
from O.S.S. were attached, then para-
chuted in to Tito. According to many of
these American officers Tito was a master
salesman, winning over visitors like Ran-
dolph Churchill, who had important con-
nections.
Americans with Mihailovich saw how
false was the information being issued by
Tito and published by the British. They
never saw him collaborate with the Ger-
mans in 1943 and 1944. What they did
see was his men fighting, killing and cap-
turing Germans with what meagre arms
they had, and at the same time trying to
hold off Partisan attacks. They found
that Chetnik forces as well as the Serbian
peasants had a deep, burning hatred for
the Nazi. Mihailovich was adored by his
people because he represented that hatted.
The Serbs felt that they faced another
evil just as great as the horrors of Fas-
cism. That was Communism, as repre-
sented by Tito and his Partisan forces,
who were determined to impose it upon
the Serbs. American missions found that
the Chetniks were being constantly be-
sieged by the Partisans, whose primary
objective seemed to be to wipe out the
Chetniks first and the Germans later.
After the invasion of Normandy
Mihailovich’s forces began an offensive
designed to clean out all German garri-
sons in north-east and north-west Serbia
and cut all main enemy communication
lines south and west from Belgrade, so
that the German forces could be bottled
and annihilated. American officers saw
many of these attacks.
Wherever they went, the American
missions found the Chetniks being
attacked by Partisans. The record shows
scores of protests by Mihailovich to the
Allies about the Partisan attacks. He
begged us to parachute in to him many
more American military observers who
could verify the situation. Are these the
acts of a traitor or collaborator?
In 1944 Mihailovich, co-operating with
an American air rescue team under
Lieuts. George Muselin and Nick Lalich,
rescued over 425 Fifteenth Air Force
flyers who had been forced down by the
Germans. Chetniks, sometimes under fire,
graded by hand a field near Ravnfe Gora
where American C.47s landed to take the
rescued airmen back to Italy. We have
the names, ranks and serial numbers of
these Americans, who are eternally grate-
ful to Mihailovich for their lives. If he
was collaborating, why did he not turn
these airmen over to the Nazis? Accord-
ing to A.A.F. estimates, 40 bomber crews
cost about $10,000,000 to train. Think
of the German arms he could have re-
ceived for these airmen!
In the lignt of tnese facts, the charges
against Mihailovich crumple. If local
truces and limited arms transactions con-
stitute collaboration, then virtually every
guerrilla group in the world has been
guilty of it, including the Partisans. While
in command of a Chinese guerrilla force
I myself sent an agent to barter with the
Japs for badly-needed quinine rather than
lose my best men to malaria. This hardly
meant that I did not hate the Japs. The
Serbs’ hatred of the Germans was just as
evident.
Mihailovich stuck with his country
,from the start to the finish.

with Belgium and the Netherlands. Certain
steps are already being taken to harmo-
nise the armed forces of those countries
with the British.
A British naval mission is in Brussels
to advise on the construction of a new,
small Belgian navy and to provide British
training for Belgian naval personnel. A
Belgian air mission, is to arrange for
British training for the Belgian air force.
The Belgians still in the R.A.F. are to be
detached and enlisted in the Belgian air
arm.
An agreement has been reached for the
dovetailing of Belgian and Dutch indus-
tries. It has been agreed that each should
refrain from creating new industries
which would compete with existing in-
dustries in the other country. Both Bel-
gium and the Netherlands are said to be
trying to purchase some small warships
from Great Britain. Concerning Ger-
many, Belgium and the Netherlands are
marching closely in step; their policy,
especially regarding the future of the
Ruhr, inclines strongly towards Britain’s
plans.

bloc, which may be fastened together if
further efforts to come to terms

“I would not have thought it possible that,
in a single year, the Soviet should have been
able to do themselves so much harm,” says
Winston Churchill, proving once more that
no figure in the international scene can even
get close to him when it comes to punch lines.
At the end of the war Russia had everybody’s
goodwill. The world was even toasting Joe
Stalin. But if Moscow had hired skilled press
agents to promote hard feeling it couldn’t
have done the job better or faster. Stalin
reminds me of a famous comedy routine by
Jim Barton, the old burlesque comic. Barton
used to portray a fellow constantly looking
behind him and taking wild swings at imagi-
nary foes. And every few minutes he would
cry “He pulled a knife on me.” — Dave

It is a fundamental principle of the Cath-
olic Church —and therefore of Catholics —that
it accepts and respects whatever form of gov-
ernment may exftt in any country provided
the rights of Christian conscience are safe-
guarded. Neither the Vatican nor the Cath-
olics, therefore, had any religious reason for
preferring the monarchy to the republic tin the
Italian elections], and so far as is known the
Vatican made no effort to influence
opinions one way or the other. The victory
of the Christian Democrat party, which
polled 35.2 per cent, of the total vote in the
election, proves that Catholic opinion is very
strong in Italy. Though this party has no
outward ties with the Vatican it nevertheless
supports Catholic doctrines and is therefore
in a certain sense the mouthpiece of the Vati-
can in Italian politics. The fact that the
Christian Democratic party rose to a position
of eminence at the very moment when the
monarchy was being voted out of existence
shows that kings may come and kings may
go without in any way affecting the position
of the Vatican.—Rome correspondent, N.Y.

An inescapable conclusion from my recent
trip to Europe was that what we call the free
enterprise system or capitalism is in a bad
way there. In Europe, the State still is
threatening to become supreme—just as if
Adolf Hitler had won. Whether it can do so
without some new epidemic of dictatorship is
doubtful. That’s the big question which the
next decade will see answered. The whole
present tendency in Europe is to let the State
do it. There is one other tendency equally
strong—to get Uncle Sam to help the State
do it. — Edward T. Leech; editor Pittsburg
“Press:”
With the exception of Czechoslovakia, when-
ever the people of Europe have had an oppor-
tunity to vote freely, they have turned down
the Communists. The French and Italian
elections established beyond doubt that this
is no haphazard instance but marks a trend
characteristic of me Europeans. Reports
from Poland indicate that if a free, unham-
pered election could be held in that country,
the Communists would be snowed under. The
Russians respond to this normal attitude of
the Europeans by attacking what they call
’the Anglo-American bloc. All their instru-
ments of propaganda are aimed at the United
States and Great Britain, the object being to
stimulate hatred for us among Europeans.
They will succeed only if the United States
and Great Britain give the Europeans direct
cause for opposition to us. For it is obvious,
certainly in Western and Middle Europe, that
the Russians have run their gamut, and that
most of the people in the various countries of
these areas, having witnessed the Russians at
work, prefer Western civilisation. — George E.
Sokotsky; N.Y. “Sun.”

Turkey was one of the few countries which
we [U.S. Congress members] visited which
made no representation or request to us for
financial assistance. She wants a great many
American products, including automobiles,
trucks, farm machinery, machine tools and
American scientific and technical assistance.
However, she desires to pay for the products
through an exchange of produce which she is
able and ready to sell to us. It was our defi-
nite impression that Turkey can well become
a great focal point' for American influence
and the advancement of American culture and
American ideals in this part of the world. Of
all the countries in the Russian orbit, the
people of Turkey have most successfully and
steadily resisted the inroads of Russian Com-
munism and Russian influence. They propose
to continue this resistance.— From the report
of a group of U.S. Congress members who
extensively toured Turkey, Russia and other

Mr. Truman vetoed the Case bill, providing
permanent curbs on organised labor by sub-
jecting them to laws from which they have
been exempted by Congress and the courts,
but which govern all other groups and organi-
sations in the nation. If a current plan
matures to return a modified form of this
measure to him as a rider on what is left of
Mr. Truman’s temporary programme of labor
restraints, it is predicted he will also veto
this bill. Unless a Senate-House conference
restores to the Office of Price Administration
certain authorities which have been eliminated
in both branches over the President’s protest,
many prophesy he will veto that measure,
too. The House, by the narrow margin of
five, fell short of the two-thirds required to
override Mr. Truman’s veto of the Case bill,
which meant that Congress had sustained it.
The same result may follow the other vetoes
if these two items of legislation go to the
White House with provisions that persuade
him to nullify them in their entirety. But
even if Congress sustains him on these
measures, a large majority will be the more
solidified in its opposition to executive pro-
grammes. And whenever that has happened
in American history the party in power
usually changes and a new man enters the
White House. — N.Y. “Times” Washington

Come October, it will be three years since
Russia, Britain and the United States agreed
in Moscow that “Austria, the first free country
to fall victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be
liberated from German domination.” That
pledge, part of the pact of Moscow, was taken
on the initiative of Cordell Hull, then Secre-
tary of State. Parties to it were British
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Mr.
Molotov. “They,” said the joint communique
issued at the time, “regard the annexation of
Austria by Germany as null and void....
They wish to see re-established a free and in-
dependent Austria and thereby to open the way
for 'the Austrian people themselves —as well as
those neighboring Slates which will be faced
with similar problems—to find that political
and economic security which is the only basis
for lasting peace.” Instead of living up to
the pledge, the Big Three, plus France, now
occupy Austria precisely as they do Germany.
Only 32,377 square miles in area, she has been
still further partitioned, for occupation pur-
poses, into four parts, each garrisoned by

lieve Russia is holding up fulfilment of the
Moscow pledge to free Austria because she
wishes to tie that area into her expanding
sphere of influence whose boundaries have not
been fixed. The Soviet demand for 70,000
acres of rich farmlands in her zone, it is
feared, may be for permanent colonisation pur-
poses rather than merely to provide food for
her army of occupation. Austria, of course,
is one of the key Danubian States. — N.Y.

No. 4: “ Jack a dull boy”
The Daily bread
.... and What Else?
Apart from a man’s effort to get
“the altogether indispensable, the
daily bread,” there is immense satis-
faction, an increasing satisfaction
that becomes real happiness, in the
pursuit of a genuine and worthy in-
terest in his leisure time. This is
particularly true if the interest is
one that adds to a man’s intellec-
tual and moral strength. There is
perhaps no brighter prospect for a man
than that of meeting each successive
year with increased strength in him-
self. There is no kind of external

There are twenty-four hours in a day. For
easy understanding of the argument I will assume
that a man spends eight hours sleeping and eight
hours working. The remaining eight hours are
not all leisure. Possibly three hours are given
to travel, eating and toilet. One hour should be
given to thought and reflection so that experi-
ences can be carded and the material of judgment
sorted. What Jack does with the four hours
left makes him a dull boy or a bright fellow.
The week-end will be a reflection of what he does
with his leisure from Monday to Friday.
Hobbies, games indoor and outdoor, reading,
study, social intercourse, the theatre, cinema,
lectures and concerts, church work, service on
committees of all kinds, membership of clubs,
lodges and societies are all fruitful employments
of leisure. But time is not expandable, so choice
of interests should be the subject of thought.
What is done should give pleasure; it should be
something to look forward to: something that
employs our aptitudes and gives us a feeling of
growth and accomplishment.
We may experiment with some interests,
but, as intimated in a previous note, before join-
ing a society, committee or group with a purpose
we should be sure that our sympathies are really
inclined that way. The threads that bind us
to previous generations are many, and their
activity is often unpredictable. They make one
man a hot-tempered Christian and another the
mildest man that ever cut a throat. It is desirable

What Pelmanism Does
The first thing Pelmanism does is to quicken the perceptions so that we are more intensely aware
of what is around us and about us. We see more and we see it more quickly and accurately. In
consequence there is a great access of confidence in our ability to acquire exact knowledge, remember
it, and recall it as required. We learn to trust our sense perception.
The way to development of inherent qualities and aptitudes is then open and relatively smooth
and easy for the normal man and woman. The more important of these qualities are:—
Observation
Will-power
Decision
Self-confidence
Organisation
Judgment
Concentration
Social Ease
Initiative
and a THOROUGHLY DEPENDABLE MEMORY
for faces, figures, names, appointments, prices and useful data of every kind.
The exercises are pleasant, and each has its special purpose. The Pelman Course is a real
training, its primary objects being to create good habits of mind and memory in place of careless and
slovenly ones, to train the conscious and the subconscious so that every faculty will, when called
upon, contribute its share in making a good performance of anything that has to be done.
THE SERVICES: Discharged or Serving. Members and ex-members of the Services are accepted

"LABOR" AND YOUR PURSE.
It is nearly five years since the Fadden
Government introduced its one and only
Budget, which was quite a good one as
- Australian Budgets go.
Mr. Fadden, obliged to increase in-
come-tax, and very properly rejecting the
temptation to increase excise and sales-
tax (he said “I am very unwilling to im-
pose any taxes that will raise prices”),
proposed to get another £5,500,000, mak-
ing the total £50,550,000 —much less than
a third of “Labor’s” exactions in the first
post-war year, allowing for the “reim-
bursements” to the States —by reducing
the exemption and raising the rates. He
proposed also what he called “a national
contribution,” a form of post-war credits,
from which he expected £25,000,000 in
the first year. Though tacked on to in-
come-tax, the national contribution was
to be reckoned as a loan repayable after
the war, plus simple interest at 2 p.c. It
was to be assessed on what was left after
payment of current Federal tax and the
previous year’s State tax.
This “national contribution,” if adopted,
would probably have led to a uniform
income-tax vastly superior to the clumsy
one now in force, from the proceeds of
which N. S. Wales and Queensland have
received inordinate shares while the three
States with small populations have had to
appeal to Canberra for massive additions
to their special grants. It would have
sugar-coated the pill for honest taxpayers
and have given the other sort some in-
centive to be honest. It might have
allayed “industrial unrest.” Certainly it
would have operated as a check on ex-
penditure, the lack of which is painfully
evident to everyone who gives impartial
consideration to the Auditor-General’s
reports and Mr. Chifley’s financial sur-
veys, such as they are.
The Fadden-Menzies Government was
defeated on its Budget. Defeated by the
Labor party, to which the electors had re-
fused a majority in each House at the
previous year’s election —of 18 contested
Senate seats it won only three, the
N.S.W. three —and by Mr. Coles and Mr,
Wilson. Neither of these Independents
had any particular objection to the
Budget, which, in fact, incorporated one
of the points, “compulsory savings,”
which Mr, Coles had presented to Vic-
torians —others, to which his new allies
were then opposed, were “compulsory en-
listment and training of men and women
for defence and civilian protection” and
“conscription for service overseas.”
Accused of voting against the Govern-
ment because he had been refused a
portfolio, Mr. Coles gave the Prime
Minister the lie, saying he had told Mr.
Fadden that “he could not regard me as
a Government supporter ‘unless I am
satisfied with the policy of your Govern-
ment and the membership of your
Cabinet; I am not seeking any prefer-
ment for myself.’ ”
Mr. Coles is enjoying “preferment”
now. Both he and Mr. Wilson have re-
tired to comfortable and lucrative posi-
tions prepared for them by the gentle-
men whom, in an evil hour for Australia,
they voted into office. At the by-elections
their seats were lost to the Opposition
by large majorities. They seem to have
had a lively apprehension of what
was coming, and the same applies to
Ministers Beasley and Makin and appa-
rently to Minister Frost.
It has been reserved for Mr. Fadden to
inquire how income-tax collections are
shaping. He must have had long and
sarcastic thoughts when Mr. Chifley re-
plied that £42,000,000 was outstanding on
June 30 —£11,500,000 more than the in-
creased contribution proposed in 1941,
of which £20,000,000 was returnable to in-
dividuals and £5,000,000 to companies, in
each case with 2 p.c. p.a., after the war.
To the £42,000,000 there have to be added
many more millions in respect of assess-
ments unissued at the end of June, 1946.
The amount is incalculable, but there is
evidence that these unissued assessments
are more numerous and add up to a
greater total than ever before. People
who have paid income-tax for 40 years,
always on the due date in the first or
second half of the year in which they
furnished returns, have not yet received
their 1944-45 assessments. In many cases
honest people owe unclaimed taxes for
two or three years, which means that they
don’t know how they stand or whether,
because of private distresses, they will be
able to pay. At least part of the money
due will never be collected.
Whoever or whatever is responsible, the
Taxation Department seems to be in as
great a muddle as the “Government” it-
self, though in respect of many of the
unissued assessments, it is probably act-
ing under orders. With stacks of un-
issued assessments on hand, it has
“launched a blitz against racketeers,
blackmarketeers and snide operators, who
are believed to owe upwards of
£6,000,000” in N. S. Wales alone. The
words are from “Truth,” one of the
Government’s favorite newspapers and
media of inspired communications, and
“Truth” gives a list of “dodgers who are
all to be questioned”:
The hotelkeeper who sold beer through
the back door, blackmarketeers, the shop-
keeper who charged blackmarket prices for
goods in short supply, the tobacconist who
made a huge additional profit from the
cigarette shortage, the s.-p. bettor and many
others.
Nothing about the shopkeeper or taxi-
driver who fleeced Americans, or the
chevalier d’industrie who, by various ex-
pedients, extracts hundreds above the
fixed prices for cars, or the medico, regis-
tered or unregistered, who doesn’t give
receipts or who charges more if a receipt
is insisted upon—it rarely is. The betting
business has its own blackmarket, and into
it, as is common talk, has gone a great
deal of the money made in other black-
markets, though perhaps not as much as
has been transferred to the racecourse.
But, according to “Truth” and the Taxa-
tion Department, “the man who does not
make a business of punting has nothing
to fear.”
If he wins £lOOO on a double and is
questioned about it he will not be likely to
have forgotten the name of the bookmaker,
the date of the meeting, the names of the
horses or the odds; and no bookmaker
would fail fo show such a loss on his bet-
ting sheets.
It would be advantageous to the book-
maker to show “such a loss”; thrice
advantageous if he got £lOO to £5OO for
showing a “loss” thtat was never in-
curred. Honest taxpayers, while wonder-
ing why there has been such a
lack of departmental curiosity as to huge
wagers in cash or on credit and prodigal
purchases of horseflesh, can expect little
from this “blitz.” The new rich will
laugh at it, unless there is a wholesale
examination of private hoards and safe
deposits.
British Chancellors of the Exchequer
and their Canadian counterparts make
a point of introducing Budgets in the first
month of their financial year. Mr. Chifley,
addressing the House on the twelfth
day of his financial year, had the face to
declare that it was “not practicable to
bring down a Budget, with detailed esti-
mates ahd papers,” before the general
election, which is to be held on the last
Saturday in September or the first Satur-
day in October. “Not practicable” to
give the people precise and detailed
accounts of the actual and proposed ex-
penditure of their money, taken from
them by the highest taxation in the world,
so that they may form their own judg-
ment before going to the polls! Under
“Labor” misrule, Parliamentary control
of the public purse has disappeared,
and now we see the people deprived of
material for imposing their own check,
though examples of prodigality occur to
them every time one of the fleet of Minis-
terial fluid-drive Chryslers flashes by or
a minor “Labor” politician boards an
airliner for another useless overseas jaunt.
Instead of the Budget it was his solemn
duty to produce, Mr. Chifley presented
what he was pleased to call “a statement.”
The statement gives merely “main heads”
of revenue and expenditure, estimated and
actual, but even so it convicts Mr. Chifley
of being a false prophet and a bogus
philanthropist.
Mr. Chifley made a great song about
his 1945-46 income-tax and sales-tax
“concessions” and the devastating effects
they would have on revenue. On
his own showing sales-tax receipts
(£33,600,150) and income-tax receipts
(£214,593,577) exceeded his estimates by
£5,600,150 and £3,593,577 respectively.
He underestimated tax-revenue from all
sources (£360,151,012) by £17,151,012. As
Mr. Fadden points out, unassailably, col-
lection of overdue taxes and issue of
overdue assessments would have pro-
vided far more than the £17,500,000 “con-
cession” announced in the “statement”
(to Mr. Chifley, who reluctantly yielded
to an election-fearing caucus, “a
second substantial cut”), and of which,
trifling as it is, wage- and salary-earners
are not yet receiving the benefit—they
are to wait for refunds till the chaos in
the Taxation Department subsides.
Next to the restoration of the rule of
law in industrial affairs, with imprison-
ment of homegrown Communist saboteurs
and deportation of the imported variety,
a sweeping measure of tax-relief is Aus-
tralia’s greatest need. But very obviously
Australia won’t get it without a change of
Government.
The New Disloyalty.
With the general run of Australians,
loyalty, if it came to a’ final test, would
be first of all loyalty to Australia. There
would be always a strong current of the
same feeling for all that “Britain” signi-
fies, as there could be also for U.N.O.
if it can be made to work. This would
hold good, too, for the bulk of people
in other parts of the Empire. It does not
hold good for Communists in any part of
it. To Communists such a conception
of loyalty would amount to rank heresy.
Their conception is the new disloyalty.
Nothing to date has more clearly ex-
posed that Communist concept than the
Canadian Soviet spy trials. Examining
witnesses after the Russian Embassy clerk
Gouzenko had given the pretty game away,
the Canadian Royal Commission found
that some of them readily admitted to “a
loyalty which took priority over the
loyalty owed by them to their own coun-
try.” That applied to subverted Cana-
dians, placing their Communist ideology
above everything, but no less dangerous
to their country than its foreign spies in
the Russian Embassy or the Polish-born
Communist member of the Canadian
Parliament known as Fred Rose.
In sentencing Rose to six years—seven
years was the maximum, but Rose had
four more charges to face in September,
each carrying a similar penalty—Justice
Wilfred Lazure commented: “Instead of
showing deep gratitude, you have be-
trayed the land of your adoption,” The
comment alone indicates the wide diver-
gence between the normal and the Com-
munist concepts of loyalty.
Rose himself pointed the difference
replying: “1 never did anything against
the interests of Canada, and no matter
what has been said 1 still insist that that is
so.” It is the reply that any Communist
caught at similar practices could be ex-
pected to make. Much the same defence
was made by Dr. Nunn May, who,
caught in Britain, affected to be serving
some high scientific concept, A weak-
ness in both cases is the damning coinci-
dence that the secret information was
going to the one country. Nunn May
was not publishing what he knew of
Britain’s atomic secrets to the world at
large; they were being sent as important
military secrets secretly to Russia. At any
time in history that has been the rankest
disloyalty; in the Communist concept it
is what passes as the only true loyalty.
Actually Nunn May, instead of being
the lofty-minded scientific idealist some
Australian dupes have accepted and
others among them have pretended to
accept, was proved beyond question to
be a participant in the same conspiracy
that Rose or Rosenberg was involved in.
Rose was charged with “lining up”
Government employees, especially in
scientific work, to deliver information to
Soviet agents operating under cover
through the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa.
On the evidence supporting these charges
it took a jury of 12 just 31 minutes to
return a verdict of guilty.
That Rose —or Nunn May, for that
matter —felt as guiltless as he pretended
under the specious “higher loyalty” plea
is something for dupes to believe; Com-
munists would know how to value the
claims, lying being as much a part of the
creed as is disloyalty to any country not
Communist-controlled. But Canadians
cannot say in Rose’s case that they had
not invited trouble, any more than Aus-
tralians can say the same regarding their
own disruptionist specimens of the breed.
In 1931 Rose was convicted of sedition
and did a year’s jail for it. Despite that,
in 1943—when, of course, Russia, and
therefore. Communism as well, were
riding high on the wave of romantic
sentimentalism conjured up by Corns.,
dupes and fellow-travellers everywhere—
Canadians elected their ex-jailbird to their
House of Commons, where he was the
only Communist member, and to where
he was again elected in 1945.
Looked at merely on its own —as aside
from the world Communist conspiracy—
all that has happened in Canada comes
down to a comparatively simple issue. It
is the old business of spying and sub-
verting. Canada happened to have, and
be sharing in, military secrets which
Soviet Russia wanted to lay hands on.
Gouzenko testified that he knew when he
left Moscow with Colonel Zabotin—
since dead of “heart failure” —that they
were going to Canada as part of a spy
plan. They were not going to an un-
prepared field. Communists were estab-
lished there as a fifth-column waiting to
give their aid. It was not, as has been
broadly understood, atom-bomb secrets
alone that were sought. One of the Nunn
May brand of “lofty-minded” scientific
idealists. Professor Raymond Boyer, has
testified that he “furnished Rose with
some secret details of the production of
the explosive RDX for transmission to
Russian agents.”
Taken merely on its own, the exposed
game in Canada was securing military
secrets; and spies, with the assistance of
fifth-columnists, have been at that game
for ages. A great difference now is that
Communists—who served so effectively
in the fifth-column role in Canada—are
flourishing wherever they are permitted
to flourish ; and hence the real question
raised by the Canadian spy trials is
whether Canada or any other democracy
can afford the risk of such fifth-columnists
in its midst. The argument* invariably
put up when this question is raised is that
in democracies there must be political
freedom—a very nice arrangement when
Communists turn out, as they have done
in Canada and elsewhere, to be active
fifth-columnists ready at a drop of the
hat to do a foreign country’s bidding.
Hitler never had anything like the wide-
spread planting of fifth-columnists that
Russia now has. It raises the further
question of what is the state of the world
that Russia most desires today? For a
variety of reasons what Russia desires —
outside Russia, where the Communist
police control is still strong enough to
keep order —is disorder and disruption,
strikes and confusion, as widespread as
fifth-columnists can possibly manage. It
serves a number of purposes. In every
country where the rule of disruption
operates that country’s return to normal
peace-time conditions and advance to
further progress are prevented. The
longer this continues in all countries the
longer it will take to settle the war-torn
and war-unsettled countries down again.
Every ton of coal not mined in Australia,
America or elsewhere ; every shipload of
food held up ; every industry that can be
slowed down or shut down —it all helps.
What it helps is the Soviet hope of build-
ing up to an overwhelming greatness —
a dim hope, in actual fact, but that is how
the Kremlin views the world.
That such a view persists is not so sur-
prising. While the countries of demo-
cracy are willing to encourage in the
name of political freedom active fifth-
columnists who hold disloyalty to them
as a leading principle of their creed the
Kremlin has sound enough cause to look
on them with contempt. How long the
democracies —including Australia —can go
on putting up with the fifth-columnists is
another matter. Canada found that it
has its dangers, and those particular
dangers might yet prove to have been
comparatively minor. In the war without
arms that is now in progress who would
say that Communists are not playing the
part of active fifth-columnists in the
Soviet interest? How long can the demo-
cracies stand the defeats they are taking
through this new disloyalty?
PLAIN ENGLISH
Mass Murder in Jerusalem.
There is frightful irony in the coincidence
of the latest and worst Jewish outrage
in Palestine with the last stage of the
Nuremberg trials. The bombing of the
King David Hotel, Jerusalem, in an
attempt to destroy almost the entire British
administrative staff —many are dead
and others were horribly maimed, and
British soldiers were among the victims
—was as cruel as any single Nazi crime
committed against Jews, with ferocious
ingratitude added.
For years Isaac Isaacs has been warn-
ing fellow-AuStralians of his faith against
supporting extreme Zionist organisations,
going so far as to point out that these
organisations were applying in Palestine
the Nazi master-race idea, were adopt-
ing Nazi methods and were on the way
to the perpetration of Nazi crimes. For all
this he was attacked by Professor Stone
in newspaper articles, some of which were
republished in a book, and as late as the
present month he was denounced at a
meeting of Sydney Jews, many of whom
“hissed and jeered every time his name
was mentioned,” especially when Rabbi
Schenk called him “a lone wolf.” It is
not in his nature to exult in the discom-
fiture of his detractors, but all men with
open minds can now see that he was right.
Respect for the person and services of
Isaac Isaacs and the memory of John
Monash should forbid any surging up of
anti-Semitism in their country. It would
be an act of Christian charity for Aus-
tralia to take a number of orphaned
Jewish children from Europe for admis-
sion into decent Australian homes. But
Mr. Calwell should certainly be placed in
the position of having to explain and
account for the Jewish immigration
policy with which he has identified him-
self while carping at the arrival of one
English family—“these English people.”
The Lyons Government sought and
obtained Parliamentary sanction for the
admission of Jewish refugees before the
second German war. On his own
authority Mr. Calwell has sanctioned the
immigration of 2000 Jews without stat-
ing where he is bringing them from, much
less giving any assurance —for what any
Calwell assurance may be worth —that
among them there are no Communists or
sympathisers with extreme Zionism. This
is not the time or place for any adapta-
tion of “Abie’s Irish Rose” sentiment.


To Paris!
Representatives of 21 countries are
meeting in Paris to do something about
the pacification of Europe, the Germans
having laid down their arms nearly 15
months ago and the Italians in 1943.
Australia is, of course, “represented” by
its lion abroad and lamb at home, Her-
bert Vere Evatt, with Senator Donald
Grant making his second trip to Paris as
observer-adviser —an appointment which,
in view of this politician’s record and
sentiments, which have never been Aus-
tralian, is an insult to the nation.
Said Mr. Menzies, protesting in the
House against the one-man-band busi-
ness: “I do not understand how one
man, who has been in Australia very little
of late, can assume to know and express
Australian public opinion when the
matters to be discussed have not been the
subject of Cabinet instruction, let alone
Parliamentary instruction.”
If the same technique is pursued in all
other countries, the peace treaties will repre-
sent not a settlement between nations but
the personal views of half a dozen men.
Undemocratic principles of this kind are
out of harmony with the principles for
which the war was fought. .
Unanswerable; and the reference to
the peace treaties looks like being borne
out in part at Paris.
The one-man-band and 16 other dele-
gations have been invited there to ap-
prove of compromise arrangements made
by Messrs. Molotov, Bevin, Byrnes and
Bidault for Italy, Finland, Bulgaria,
Hungary and Rumania. In utter con-
tempt of the Atlantic Charter, to which
Stalin has committed himself at least
thrice, Finland, Rumania and Hungary,
stripped respectively of Petsamo, Bes-
sarabia and Transylvania, and required
to pay indemnities to Russia (and, in
Hungary’s case, to Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia), are to be placed under a
So iet hegemony. The terms for Bul-
garia are obscure, but Italy is to be de-
prived of all its colonies and compelled
to make territorial concessions to Yugo-
slavia and France, though —also in con-
tempt of the Atlantic Charter —it is to
retain South Tyrol. Population-pressure
in the unfortunate country —certainly a
cause of the late war—will be worse than
ever, and there is to be a new Dantzig,
this time on the Adriatic. The beginnings
of a new Unredeemed Italy agitation are
already observable.
For Germany nothing has been agreed
to by the so-called Big Four, though
there can be no pacification of Europe
without a German settlement. The
country is still divided into four zones,
and the British zone is costing the British
taxpayer £80,000,000 a year, mainly for
food to keep the inhabitants alive. Their
numbers have been swelled by Germans
expelled from Czechoslovakia and
Poland, the state of which country seems
as horrible as the state of Germany as
reduced under the Potsdam agreement, in-
terpreted by Soviet imperialism, and
what is going on behind the iron curtain
in the parts of Germany annexed by
Russia can only be guessed at.
Such of the little Leftist editors as are
not appalled at the claims and aspect of
the new Russian imperialism are blithely
predicting that when the peace of ex-
haustion has teen written Russia will be
supreme in Europe and Asia, the
mightiest empire in recorded history.
Perhaps it will; but will it last? Nobody
could have imagined in 1940-41 that little
Norway would have a greater survival
value than Nazi Germany, but it had.
And the chances are that peaceful
Switzerland and Sweden will have a
greater survival value than the new empiie
of the new Tsars.
"Labor" Generosity.
Mr. MCEwen is not humorous in appear-
ance and has rarely been the cause of
humor in others, but in the debate on fhe
Wheat Stabilisation Bill he said a thing
which must have made many a farmer
laugh, though grimly. He was referring
to “Labor” operations with their wheat:
In the course of a few weeks the Minister,
Mr. Scully, sold wheat out of the same silo
at ss. 2d. a bushel for bread, at 3s. lid. for
power alcohol, at ss. 6d. for the United
Kingdom and ports east of Suez, at
3s. IHd. for a gin distillery, and at 3s.
KHd. for pigfeed. ,
After this the deputy leader of the
Country party became inquisitive as to
the Scully negotiations with Maoriland
Labor. His curiosity was not satisfied,
but in a statement to the Parliament at
Wellington Mr. Sullivan, the Minister of
Supply, was fairly explicit. First, he
denied that his Government was paying
9s. 3d. a bushel for Australian wheat,
saying that it had “agreed to pay world
parity for this year, 9s. Id. a bushel”
world parity is more, and there is every
sign that it will rise much higher. But
there was another arrangement;
Australia will supply our Dominion’s
requirements for the next four or five years
at ss. 9d. a bushel. That is to be the
ceiling price, and if there is any fall in
world parity or any factor justifying a re-
duction in the next four or five years New
Zealand will get the benefit.
Then there was a bit about the domestic
situation:
When this Government came into power
[ll years ago] wheat was 4s. 7-Jd. a bushel.
Today it is 7s. Id. The 7s. Id. has been
guaranteed to growers for the 1946-47 and
1947-48 harvests. I think that is very
reasonable for both sides.
Mr. Sullivan also said that his Govern-
ment had “promised the executive com-
mittee of the wheatgrowers’ organisation
to set up a commission to examine costs.”
This has so far been refused to Australian
wheatgrowers by Mr. Scully and his
“Government,” and his “stabilised” price
for bagged wheat of the 1945-46 and
1949-50 harvests is ss. 2d. a bushel at
ports. His rosiest anticipation of what
growers of 1945-46 wjjeat may expect,
with “concessions,” Is “6s. 7d. a bushel
f.o.r. at ports, bagged.” In short, he is
forcing wheatgrowers to be generous to
other people (though not to the British)
at their own expense, and what with
drought and “Labor”-caused afflictions
they naturally object. And they all have
votes, far more than in 1943, in which
year many farmers and farmers’ sons
were away at the war, while there had
been a wholesale “reservation” of city
and country unionists and the entire band
of Communist secretaries and organisers,
many of them of military age, whose
numbers increased.
With votes in mind, Mr. Scully was be-
trayed into what looks like an invitation.
When the second reading of his five-and-
tuppence measure was being forced
SEEING A MAN ABOUT A HAT.
“Senator Hattil Foil, who said 17 months ago that ‘General Blarney should resign ...the
best service he could render Australia,’ has been excluded from the Queensland Liberal ticket."
“Mister, here’s your hat, with a soldier’s farewell.’’
through, he said “Unless the States pass
supplementary legislation there can be no
stabilisation plan.” It is doubtful whether
the Westralian Parliament, for one, will
pass it. With an election of its own
coming on, it must have a keen sens? of
the fact that the 1919-20 export value
figures in the Commonwealth Year-Book
at 9s. a bushel and that, having relatively
more to export than the wheatgrowing
States with much larger populations,
Westralian growers received from that
year’s pool round 10s. a bushel at ports.
And even before Mr. Scully came out
with his stabilisation scheme, Westralian
Labor had lost a wheat-and-sheep elec-
torate, Greenough, to the Liberals, who
hadn’t won Greenough for upwards of
30 years.
One Ex-Servicemen's League.
“A.1.F., N.G.,” is for it:
Growing evidence that the “Labor” Gov-
ernment’s preference to ex-servicemen legislation
is merely a sop to sentiment, to be brusneo
aside and overruled whenever it conflicts witn
preferment to party hacks and hangers-on,
gives emphasis to the opinion that there should
be but one ex-servicemen’s association.
By virtue of its seniority, its recognised posi-
tion in the community and its work during the
almost 30 years of its existence, that body
should be the R.S.L., but up to the present the
League has shown a reluctance to accept the
honor on the ground that to do so it must
change its make-up so completely that it would
become a different league.
At present the main barrier to the League
becoming the sole instead of merely the chief
body concerned with the interests of ex-ser-
yicemen is the emphasis placed on the word
“returned,” both in the name and in the spirit
of the organisation. An association of volun-
teers it has always been, but it is a little
incongruous that a concern that between the
wars consistently supported the principle ot
compulsory military service should debar from
membership militiamen who were compulsorily
called to the colors.
The A.1.F.-Mililia question, bitterly argued
in 1942-43, is now almost ancient history, and
many A.I.F. men in the League feel if is time
all barriers were scrapped and that service
in the armed forces, with an honorable dis-
charge, should be the only qualification for
membership of the fine organisation built up
by the Old Diggers. Others, while not going
the whole road in this direction, urge that at
least the ranks should be open to all who
volunteered —irrespective of whether they served
outside Australia or not.
When the matter was last before the Federal
Congress of the League a decision was de-
ferred pending demobilisation, so that soldiers
of 1939-45 would be able to express an opinion
on the subject. In some States this opinion
has already been expressed; at recent confer-
ences Queensland and Tasmanian congresses
passed resolutions supporting the admission
of all “who volunteered and were accepted
by the armed forces.” South Australia has
unfortunately voted against any alteration m
the terms of eligibility. Westralia takes a vote
during August. .
Leaving the question of luck out of it there
is no doubt that many thousands of A.I.F.
volunteers —the Armored Divvy men are the
outstanding examples—and many more thou-
sands of R.A.A.F. volunteers chafed within the
bounds of Australia throughout the tvar and
were, through no fault of their own, prevented
from going overseas. These men, in sentiments
and principles, are at one with their brothers
who fought in the Middle East, Malaya and the
Pacific; flew ’planes over Europe or Burma;
fought their ships on every ocean. They need
the R.S.L. and the R.S.L. needs them.
In the coming years it is going to be difficult
enough even for a strong centralised league
to achieve anything tangible for ex-service-
men. Half a dozen minor bodies will achieve
less than nothing. The gulf between them will
I inevitably widen and their differences will be
seized upon by unscrupulous politicians as an
excuse for scuttling what small degree of pre-
ference has been so far gained.
When the R.S.L. was founded the issue
of the “returned” qualification for membership
was relatively simple. Not only were the battle-
fields half a world away, but apart from the
most elementary stuff even the training was
carried out overseas, so that with the excep-
tion of a few last-minute enlistees the A.I.F.
all went overseas. But even then it might
have been better if the founders had allowed
these in and placed the emphasis on volun-
teering rather than on returning. No Old
Digger would claim that any particular merit
attached to returning, whatever virtue they
might claim in going away. In the first World
War 60,000 fine Diggers who left our shores
never became eligible for membership of the
R.S.L. They were never allowed to call them-
selves “returned soldiers.” They did not re-
turn. They were buried in Gallipoli, Palestine,
Flanders and France.
Thunder on the Left.
Since his dickering with fellow-dictator
Perdn of Argentina, Pal Joey Stalin’s
name has become mud in some surprising
quarters in the U.S.A., one of the most
thunderous outbursts occurring in the
Leftish New York “Post.” That daily’s
Edgar Ansel Mowrer let fling at Joey in
the language of the Chicago ‘ Tribune
attacking British Royalty.
Declared Mr. Mowrer: “Soviet Russia s
renewal of diplomatic relations with
Argentina is so immoral that it is funny.
To match the spectacle of Dictator Presi-
dent Juan Perdn physically embracing
Soviet Trade Mission Chief Constantive
Shevelev you have to go back to 1939
and Stalin greeting Hitler in the name of
their ‘friendship sealed in blood.’ ”
But there’s one thing about these bright
boys of the Left —they certainly know
their sometime beloved Soviet. Mr.
Mowrer declares that “in the Soviet glos-
sary. ‘Fascism’ is just another word for
hostility to the Soviet Union; once a
German, Bulgarian, Rumanian or Argen-
tinian ceases to oppose Moscow he be-
comes a ‘democrat.’ ” “The truth,”
further declares Mr. Mowrer, “is that
Bolsheviks have always got on better with
‘Fascist beasts’ than with democrats or
even with capitalists. Totalitarians natur-
ally gravitate toward one another.” By
way of illustration, Mr. Mowrer draws
on a hitherto veiled or bowdlerised gem
of recent history:
. There was that inspiring scene at the
Moscow railroad station when Stalin, took
tearful leave of his friend Matsuoka [now
no more] —both tight as ticks.
A Gallup poll taken after the Stalin-
Peron deal disclosed a clear majority of
Americans now convinced that Russia is
trying to build itself up to be the ruling
Power of the world. On that Mr. Mow-
rer comments: “From seeing through this
ambition to stopping it is not too long
a step.”
The Argentinian deal must have been
very galling indeed all along the Left.
A New Outback Occupation.
Farmer Fordcubbin makes a night of it :
You hadn’t taken much notice of the novelty
of being able to hear the Commonwealth
Parliament in session. The missus said she
was delighted with Dame Enid Lyons, and
the boys asked a silly question about whether
Mr. Chifley spoke with his pipe in dais mouth,
and you got off a good one when you replied,
“I dunno, but I’ll bet most of ’em speak with
their tongues in their cheeks”; but what with
getting ready to shear the wethers and chasing
round looking for a coil for the tractor and
worrying whether some rain would come in
time for the wheat, you hadn’t much chance
to listen to a lot of politicians yapping.
Then Morley rang up to ask if he could
borrow your scarifier to touch up a bit 9!
fallow, and after you said he could he came in
with “Bet you’ll be all ears tonight, Jack.
You waited, not saying anything, because
Morley is one of those coves always out to
catch you, but he comes back with “Yairs,
they’re debating old Scully’s five-an’-tuppence
a bushel at ports—four-an’-six that’ll be to
you. They’ll be on the air with his bill at 7.20.
After tea you say, “Now, there’s to be no
arguments or anythin’ tonight, because I want
to list'en-in to Parliament. You can play
crib if you like, but you gotter be quiet.
There’s a barney at once; young Tom wants
to listen to a junior-farmer talk from the
regional, and Jack has sent in a query to a
quiz and expects to hear it tonight. You asseit
yourself, however, and scold the missus when
she murmurs something about she didn t think
you had time for radio politics. ,
The boys keep on grumbling and there s
snarling and backchat until the missus, ever
the peace-maker, suggests that they take the
car and go to the pictures. You hand Jack ten
bob and tell him to be careful with the car.
The missus purses her lips and looks slightly
suspicious when you offer to do the washing-
up. You canfi explain that you want to get
rid of her rattling and clinking of dishes. She
lets you do it, but you know by her silence
and preoccupation that she’s expecting you to
spring a confession or something on her. You
do it; then you bustle round and get the fire
going, put a magazine and some knitting where
she can’t fail to see ’em and, with everything
set, tune in and wait. .
An orchestra fills in time. Outside the wind
drops twigs and leaves faintly on the iron
roof; the cat yowls to be let in; the dogs
rush madly round the house and back again,
barking as though they’d sighted seven devils;
you brood on whether the grass on the back
road paddock will hold out and “We are
now crossing to Parliament House b-r-rp
scowch yarwark skeeoo-ow.”
You fiddle with the controls and the voice
of Archie Cameron (Barker, S.A.) comes over.
“Ah-ah,” you think, “Arch’ll pour it into
’em.” You-sit back. Arch, his determined
voice rising above a barrage of coughs,
mumbles and snorts, announces that he intends
to review the history of the wheat industry.
Arch’s rolling r’s ripple round the room. He
rolls into 1910 and rolls out again. He knows
his onions and makes some telling points.
Suddenly Arch is finishing. He wants amend-
ments. The missus wants some tea. Ihe
fire needs more wood. Next thing you know
Joseph Ignatius Langtry (Labor, Rivenna) is
spitting words like a machine-gun, his aspirates
falling like rain, his indignation at once having
carted wheat to Strathmerton or somewhere
being almost too much for him.
The missus sighs and the wild wheatgrower
from Riverina demands a vote from all farmers
for Labor, the Farmer s Friend. Die missus
goes to bed as the slow, careful voice of
Charles Frederick Adermann (Country Parly.
Maranoa Q) takes up the debate. You re
alone no’w and somehow you listen the more
closely. Charles Frederick traverses the faults
thp hill as he sees them, and Arthur
Neiberding ’Fuller (Labor, Hume, N.S.W.)
gets going with fine, flowing phrases. You
know he’s reading them and you listen closely
Art is dead certain that no farmer would be
sillv enough to vote for the Country party.
Against the bill is the. Honorable Percy
Claude Spender, K.C. (Liberal, Warnngah,
NSW) Percy sees a lot of political turpitude
in it and that reminds you that you should have
got the boys to pick up a drum of turpentine.
Percy wants to get some figures in. He does.
Nothing happens. It’s a pity you forgot that
turpentine. P Then comes . Donald Alfred
Mountjoy (Labor, Swan, W.A.), and Donald,
forgetting for a moment the Marvellous Soviet,
takes to Bob Menzies. Bob you visualise
sitting there almost as sleepy as you are, and
you wonder if Bob is worrying about turpen-
tine or a tractor coil or Mountjoy and you
open your eyes slightly as Donald Alfred cries
to the listening world to vote Labor—and
Stalin? No; he didn’t mention Stalin.
The Speaker gives the call to the member
for Wi'mmera, but the debate is adjourned.
You look at the clock and near y jump three
feet. It’s 20 to 12. And so to bed, as some-
one said.

POLITICAL PONTS
A piquant situation will arise if the
electors make the next House a 37-37
affair, giving Blain the odd vote—if he
can vote. What is certain is that the
Opposition will be united against Rose-
vear. It objects to his descending from
his place to make rankly partisan speeches
in committee, and it hadn’t got over his
suspension of Tommy White when Holt
was suspended for raising a point of
order. “A clear breach of Standing
Orders,” said Menzies on a motion of no-
confidence in the Speaker. It was gagged
and defeated, after Fadden had been
called to order for a reference to “arrant
humbug,” terms which, he pointed
out, had been used by the Speaker him-
self in one of his rankly partisan speeches.
Large-scale N.S.W. coal stoppages pre-
ceded and followed the introduction of
the Coal Industry Bill by Dedman, who
characteristically blamed the mine-
owners for nearly everything. The
scheme looks like an extension of the
“control” measure under which there
have been huge revenue losses as well
as many strikes and much loafing at
Coalcliff. Meantime Victorian industries
have been coal-less for weeks, Adelaide
has to go without Saturday trams, Sun-
day trains, gas—except at intervals —and
heating for baths and coppers, and N.S.W.
goods-train services have been cut another
25 p.c. And with Melbourne asked to
use 20 p.c. less gas the “Labor” Govern-
ment has had a wonderful idea —it is
going to “take over” the gas companies.
The secretary of the Overseas Shipping
Representatives is out with a statement
that wharf robberies, particularly at Bris-
bane, have become worse than at any
time before the war or during the war.
This is astonishing. Didn’t “Labor”
appoint a Cabinet sub-committee, with
Dr. Evatt to attend to the legal measures,
that was to have wiped out wharf rob-
beries in jig-time?
Casey’s decision not to stand in Sep-
tember was announced in manly and
graceful language which put a lot of
liars to shame. He said he had “ap-
peared on the scene too late to offer my-
self for an appropriate constituency,” and
had declined “several offers” from
Liberal candidates for “constituences
with specialised interests” for which
“they are better suited than I am.”
Should a suitable by-election occur his
hat will be in the ring. Meanwhile, he
“will willingly and enthusiastically sup-
port the Liberal party and its leader, Mr.
Menzies,” with whom, and with “the
office-bearers of the party,” he is “in the
most cordial relations.” The indications
are that he wifi be kept busy as a
speaker.
Crawford and Foil entered the Senate
together in 1917 as Nationalists from
Queensland, and by the irony of circum-
stances they are to leave it together.
Crawford did not seek nomination for an-
other six-year term. Foil did, as a Liberal
this time, and was turned down in favor
of Neil O’Sullivan, a lawyer of many in-
terests who was in the R.A.A.F., and Miss
Annabelle Rankin, whose father was a
politician. Old Digger Senator Cooper,
who has made good in public life, will be
their team-mate and No. 1 on the ballot
paper. He was that in 1940, and he
topped the poll.
Foil took his exclusion badly, making
an invidious reference to the Catholic and
women’s votes, on second thoughts water-
ing it down. The truth is that Queens-
landers have had enough of him and of
Crawford and their stupid old feud,
which, unconcealed even in Parliamentary
debates, has operated to the advantage
of the other side.
In the frenzy of rejection Foil talked
of coming out as an Independent. It
would be very foolish, for since preferen-
tial voting arrived his personal vote has
been very small—only 2322 on one occa-
sion with upwards of 400,000 electors
voting. He has a couple of directorships
and perhaps his friend Romano will sell
him a share in Bern borough.
No doubt Casey has grown accustomed
to reading nonsense about himself, but
he must have been amused at this bio-
graphical note in a Sydney Sunday paper:
He is married to a daughter of Surgeon-
General Sir Charles Ryan, Liberal member
in the House of Representatives for the Vic-
torian seat of Fawkner.
If that were true, Charles Ryan would
make Billy Hughes and Joe Silver Col-
lings feel like puling infants. It is 70
years since he was a surgeon in the
Turkish army; 30 years since he was a
terror to A.I.F. leadswingers; just on 20
years since he died. It is his son Rupert,
himself 62, who is M.H.R. for Flinders
—not Fawkner —and a daughter of
Charles Ryan—called “Plevna” till he be-
came “theGutzer King”—is Mrs. Casey.
The day bread rationing was in-
troduced in Britain the Attlees suffered a
rude by-election shock. In Bexley, a
Kentish division, its general-election
majority was reduced from 11,673 to
1851. ' i
From “Outback”:
It took many weeks to obtain even 1143
bales of wool for the first (and last) wool
appraisement at Moree (N.S.W.) in the Scully
store. The store was “officially opened” by
Scully the day before the war-time appraisement
scheme ended, and he had a lot to say about
the establishment of country wool appraisement
centres being “a real contribution” to “the
welfare of the wool industry and the economic
stability and development of Australia.”
Tenders have been called for the erection of
a store in Rockhampton (Q.), the principal
town in Capricornia, Forde’s electorate. On
two occasions in Parliament Fadden asked
for the names of woolgrowers or woolgrowers’
organisations that were in favor of it. He
was finally informed that it was “Government
policy.”
Victorian industry has now become de-
pendent on the weather as well as the
caprices of N.S.W. coalminers. A week-
long gale and mountainous seas along
the coast dislocated shipping, and the
battle of three colliers to make port —
they were loaded with 14,350 tons of coal
for gas and industrial purposes—became
a matter of absorbing public interest.
Their arrival or non-arrival made all the
difference between employment and un-
employment and whether the citizen
would get the gas to cook his dinner.
The censorship position is one that
would not be tolerated in any other
country. The Commonwealth has powers
of censorship over imported books, but
none on books published in Australia.
Censorship over local books is vested
in the States, so that if one bans a book
all the others can rush and read it. This
may react to the benefit of the author,
but it absolves the Federal authorities of
all responsibility. There is a story of a
Commonwealth Minister who was asked
what steps his Government was going to
take about a certain novel, “It doesn’t
have to take any,” he replied, “Where
can I buy a copy?”
Sole survivor in public life of the
Labor members who followed W. M.
Hughes into the conscription camp in
1916, James Cornell has been named
president of the Westralian Leg. Council
in succession to J. W. Kirwan, the first
M.H.R. for Kalgoorlie. Cornell had
been chairman of aommittees for 20
years. After 1916 he went off to the
wars, and since his return he has been a
pillar of the R.S.L.
The Sydney “Government’s” brick-
works venture has been under way for
over a week and there hasn’t been a
strike. There are five kilns, but with
coalminers so busy fishing and dog-
punting only one will be in action. Pro-
duction is estimated by Minister Cahill,
as per the “Sun,” at “26,000,000,000
bricks a year,” and Premier McKell is to
perform the ceremony of taking the first
brick out of the kiln early next month.
The second brick is expected sometime in
November,
Prospects of reform of Victoria’s liquor
legislation are more remote than ever.
The Cains want the Libs, and Agrarians
to join an all-party committee. The C.P,
won’t play until the Government says
what sort of legislation it wants and
forms a select committee. The Libs,
want an all-party committee but think
the Government should institute the in-
quiry. There are votes to lose or gain in
all directions. Lud Mayor Connelly’s
beer garden dream will have to wait for
the Millennium.
“Under the wool-purchase arrangement
with the United Kingdom, growers
received the Ml contract price.”
Thus Chifley, defending “the appropria-
tion to a trust fund” of “profits on skin
wools, tops, noils and waste and deferred
price on wool content of manufactured
goods exported”—admitted to be “more
than £7,000,000 and expected to reach
£10,000,000.” These “arguments” satisfied
Caucus, but suppose the wool-purchase
administration had been handed over to
Goldsbrough Morts and they had
claimed the £7,000,000 to £10,000,000 on
the ground that growers had received
“the full contract price,” how Chifley and
his crowd would be roaring!
When Joe Abbott, M.H.R., referring to
the Canadian spy-ring disclosures, asked
whether the Government was doing any-
thing to investigate Communist activities
here and whether it was taking any
counter-espionage measures, “poor old
Holloway” promised “some sort of reply”
if notice was given. “Some sort of reply”
was afforded a week later when Holloway
refused to disclose whether the Govern-
ment had or had not investigated Com-
munist activities or had or had not under-
taken counter-espionage work. “Rea-
son”: it would not be in the public in-
terest to disclose the information. If
“Labor” did decide to look into Commo.
affairs it would probably appoint a sub-
committee consisting of Thornton, Healy
and Sharkey, with Donald Grant as
observer-adviser.
With only 12 delegates out of more
than 400 dissenting, a Victorian conference
of R.S.L. sub-branches upheld President
Holland’s ruling that Communists were
debarred from membership of the
League, There was a howl from the few
Commos who had managed to infiltrate
into the League, which stands for most
of the decent things they profess to
despise and which has been an “Imperial”
League from the beginning, but 99.9 per
cent, of the Diggers will support the de-
cision.
Keon, M.L.A., “debating” with Flana-
gan, of Thornton’s Red Racket, the
proposition “whether or not the Iron-
workers’ Association and the Communist
party are a menace to Australian trade
unionism,” at the Richmond (Vic.) Town
Hall, met a yelling mob of 5000 whose
opinions were as divided on the subject
as their ideas of the rules of debate.
Hitler salutes were directed with fine im-
partiality at both speakers: coats, hats,
handkerchiefs and papers rained upon
those who only wanted to listen, and the
strains of “Ferdinand” mingled with the
“Internationale.” Words like “Toorak,”
“Communist,” “Russia” and “Menzies”
produced demonstrations lasting from
three to 15 minutes, and a tussle between
the two contestants for a Union Jack
which hung above the platform resulted
in a draw, some patriot rescuing the piece
of bunting before it was torn to pieces.
Flanagan got approximately 20 words in
edgeways in a speech lasting 35 minutes,
and Keon squeezed in about an equal
number.
Now that the last of the Dutch ships
held up since September by Communist
brigandage have got away, though with-
out the Australian cargoes they would
have carried, one of those Labor Councils
has tried to make a virtue of humiliation
by lifting the ban as it
port of Sydney. The Perth-Fremantle
carpenters were the first to declare it off
It transpires that paint- and plate-work
was done on the Tasman in Sydney in
spite of the Communists, and a delegate
from the shipwrights said the ban had
“made Australia look ridiculous.” “l n .
famous” would have been a more appro-
priate word, but the delegate was on the
spot when he said that “the Communists’
Indonesian comrades were fighting side
by side with the Japanese against the
Dutch, so Australia should be on the side
of the Dutch.” Had the troubles occurred
before Australia began to be infested
with Communists, no other side would
have been thought of.
“Oh, God, put back Thy universe and
give me yesterday!” was the prayer of
a character in a forgotten play. Pity a bit
of it couldn’t be put back long enough to
admit of “Australian” Communists who
make allies of brown savages and
encourage white Australian girls to con-
sort with buck niggers to be deposited
for an hour on Lambing Flat as it was of
old. A sentiment like that uttered by
Healy, the Communist boss of the water-
siders, “My urlion maintained the ban on
the Dutch ships at the request of Indo-
nesian seamen,” would have earned the
utterer a speedy exit from Lambing Flat
adorned with feathers and tar.
The population of Maoriland at the
census of September, 1945, has been
finally reckoned at 1,747,679, Maoris in-
cluded, an increase of 11 per cent, on the
1936 census total. Excluding Maoris and
migratory persons, the urban population
is figured at 63.12 p.c., up 3.58 p.c., and
the rural population at 36.88 p.c., down
4.42 p.c,—a serious matter for a Do-
minion so dependent on its land indus-
tries ; during the 10 years North Islanders
increased by 128,256 to 1,146,292 .and
South Islanders decreased by 232 i. to
556,006. These particular calculatibns
do not take into account 45,381 service-
men overseas on the census date, but it
is held that their inclusion “would not
materially alter the ratio.”
J. F.. D. Scarborough, a Melbourne
architect recently returned from Sweden,
recounts the way a Swede goes about re-
lieving his housing shortage. He gets all
his relatives together, they begin working
furiously on the site of the prospective
dwelling from early morning until mid-
night (in those northern latitudes the light
is still good enough then), the timber is
delivered to the site already cut and all
the domestic builders have to do is to fit
the pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle.
Scarborough offered the idea as a sugges-
tion to Barry, the Housing Minister, on
the assumption that only the weather is
likely to prevent such methods being
adopted by this country. Scarborough
doesn’t realise the strength of the trade-
union interest.
Reported that Britain is sending recruit-
ing officers to Eire to persuade 10,000
young Irishmen to work in British mines.
If the recruiters meet with any success
Chifley might borrow them to do a bit
of persuading among the N.S.W. miners.
Professor Einstein is no doubt a great
authority on relativity, but his latest pro-
posed solution of the atomic problem is
not impressive. He says that conditions
must be established that guarantee the in-
dividual State the right to solve its con-
flicts with other States on a legal basis
and under international jurisdiction, and
that a supra-national organisation sup-
ported by military power exclusively
under its control must prevent the indi-
vidual State from taking aggressive
action. After the first world war this
was supposed to be the function of the
League, but the League could not pre-
vent even minor wars. Every nation
had its military forces in those days.
None of them called them forces of
aggression; they all called their own
armies defence forces and those of their
neighbors aggressive forces.

“Curtain Raiser”; Music-lovers who
deliver such confident opinions in the
foyers of concert halls little know how
much other senses besides the ear can
come into our judgments. Todd Duncan
was due to give a recorded broadcast,
and the radio was turned on at a Mel-
bourne party. The voice that rolled
forth was dealing with Handel, Brahms
and other European song composers.
Everybody voted Todd’s performance

young lady, “it is splendid for a negro,
but all the same you can clearly recog-
nise the note of the Congo in it.” Then
the announcer chipped in: “You have

cast of Harold Williams, the Australian

“Macnell”: Rabaul con-’
tinues to offer surprises in
the way of ammunition
caches undeclared by the
Japs. What promises to be
the biggest yet was dis-
covered by a fossicking
Chinaman behind Tunnel
Hill. An overgrown en-
trance no bigger than a
cabin door leads into a maze
of tunnels, cross channels,
bays and galleries in which
lie a vast quantity of ex-
plosives and weapons. The
passages are earth, with
arched roof, the main one
running straight into the
hill. At regular intervals
cross tunnels branch off, to
be again interconnected by
passages parallel to the
main. So far located
are 24-inch torpedoes by the hun-
dred, tons of 8-inch and 12-inch naval
shells, neat long rows of 20001 b. bombs
and every conceivable type of s.a.a.;
field guns, machine-guns, stacks of rifles,
smoke floats, mortar bombs and wireless
sets by the score —these last vindictively
bashed to pieces. The naval Rendering
Mines Safe unit has taken over the huge
dump, and it will be deloused. If they
slip old Matupi’s volcanic effort will be
pop-gun calibre to the convulsion which
could slam Rabaul back to the shambles
from which it is now slowly emerging.

“Spokeshave”: Queer trades? A friend
breeds blowflies for a firm with a new
fly spray. When asked what the blow-
flies are for he says they are to test out
the fly spray, but I fancy he is trying to
breed a race of super-blowflies that can
resist all sprays except the one his firm
sells.

“Penelope’s Mate”: A book could be
written about the sabotage practised by
Diggers while Jap prisoners. A young
loot who was put in charge of our wharf
party one day just didn’t understand. It
was his first appearance and he was all
at sea, and not a little scared by what he
saw: busted crates, “scrounging,” trading
with natives, sand in engines, “accidental”
derailments, and so on. Our little team
of Aussies had punched nail-holes in
petrol drums and there were nice leaks.
Imagine our feelings when the loot called
a Jap stevedore and protested that it was
dangerous for men to be working where
petrol was leaking. Fortunately the Jap
was boneheaded. He plugged up a hole
in one drum and disappeared.
“McGlum”: In nur prison camp the
M.O. probably had cause to hate the
Japs more than anyone, but the only
way he had of blowing off steam was to
employ a blistering vocabulary which
sometimes convinced even the Japs he
was displeased. One day, having finished
his long round, he was taking it easy in
his quarters when a Jap officer unex-
pectedly looked in. The Doc let forth
a torrent of abuse and went back to his
reading. The book was gently but firmly
removed from his hands and he heard the
Jap say “H’m! Bernard Shaw. What
language he employs!” No, the Doc
wasn’t bashed. He copped a slashing
salute from the “taisa,” who put down
the book and went on his way.

“R. Volt”: Eastern Extension, to be
made a public service by the Telecom-
munications Bill, had its vicissitudes in
its pioneering days. When the Cocos-Fre-
mantle-Adelaide cable was laid it was
decided to establish a depot at Port
Adelaide to save the long wait that
occurred while a repair ship came from
Singapore to mend a broken cable. Land
was leased above Jervois bridge, the
channel was dredged, a wharf, sheds and
cable tanks were erected and the ship, a
brand-new one, was due to steam into its
berth. Then the shore staff got the horrors.
The bridge was a swinging one and no-
one had thought to measure the gap. An
anguished superintendent, his electrician
and engineer hired a cab and galloped
round the town looking for some author-
ity who could give them the dimensions,
but nobody could be located. When the
“Now, perhaps, you’ll stick to your mouth-organ!’’
ship steamed into the gap there were
hundreds of spectators, the mayor and
councillors included, but three men were
particularly interested in the proceedings.
There was eight inches to spare on each
side and all the ship lost was a few
square yards of paint. The crowd got a
magnificent display of seamanship, plus
the luridest exhibition of bad language
ever heard even in Port Adelaide. For
that skipper was famous from Shang-
hai to Darwin for his vocabulary of pic-
turesque phrases.

“Half-clad”: Visiting a tailor who
advertised “preference for ex-servicemen”
I found I couldn’t have a suit made
under four months. “But,” said the
snip’s offsider, “try on one of these un-
claimed jobs.” It didn’t fit. The assistant
assumed the expression of one about to
tell me where I could get cigarette papers.
“Come back Saturday,” he whispered.
“We’ll have another batch of unclaimed
suits in. But be early—they go like hot
cakes.” Ned Kelly was a gentleman.

“K.G.C.” on a Melbourne centenary:
Port Phillip Settlement was not long in ex-
istence before the medicoes, under the guidance
of Patrick Cussen, first Colonial Surgeon,
formed the Port Phillip Medical Association.
The date was July 29, 1846, and meetings were
held at the members’ houses. At first they
were more convivial than scientific, that on Sep-
tember 7, 1847, Dr. D. J. Thomas, M.R.C.S.,
read a paper “Some Remarks About the Use
of Ether.” This paper, now yellowed with age,
describes the first operation under an anaesthetic
in Melbourne. The first ether operation in Eng-
land had taken place only ten months before.
Dr. Thomas had tested the drug on himself,
and he decided to try it on a patient when
James Egan, a settler on the Campaspe, was
brought to Melbourne with his right hand
shattered through the bursting of a gun. In
the presence of four other doctors, Thomas
administered ether through an oral tube. Dr.
Wilkie, who was feeling the pulse of the patient,
gave the signal to proceed with the operation.
Dr. Thomas cut his flaps and amputated the
arm in record time—4o seconds.
While the bleeding vessels were being tied with
horsehair the patient recovered consciousness
and was surprised to find his arm off. The
unsterilised flaps were stitched by unsterilised
fingers, needle and horsehair. This was rein-
forced by sticking plaster, covered with a warm
linen cloth, oiled silk and a bandage, Egan being
given a large dose of opium and brandy. These
doses were repeated for three days, when the
stitches were removed; but the sticking plaster
left. Egan was taken off brandy and opium
and put on food and two bottles of stout daily.
His arm was treated freely with caustic and
chloride of lime. He progressed so well that at
the end of a month he rode home with his arm
quite healed. Our pioneers were a tough lot.

“Bethune”; I was travelling on a late
train from Adelaide to the Port, the only
occupants of the compartment half a
dozen British sailors. One of them came
over to me and asked if I objected to the
pipes. A couple of them were smoking
and, rather surprised at such unusual
solicitude for the feelings of a fellow-
passenger, I hastened to assure him that
I had no objection, pulling out a cigar-
ette myself to make him feel quite at
ease. He rejoined his mates and I re-
sumed reading my paper. A few minutes
later I was rudely interrupted by the
skirling of bagpipes—and didn’t they
skirl! The pipes may sound inspiring
when the Scots play them upon their
native heath, but until you’ve heard ’em
in a small railway carriage you’ve never
really heard them at all. I bore up man-
fully, but next time I’m asked if I mind
the pipes I’ll tell the inquirer my name’s
Cumberland.

“Uco”: Malnutrition, as “Melbn”
points out (B. 24/7/’46), is not confined
to families on or near the breadline.
A few years ago I knew a young couple
who were bringing up their only chick on
—so they thought—strictly scientific lines.
They stuck rigidly to diet scales and
timetables, could speak with authority
about vitamins and proteins and were
honestly trying to do their duty by the
child. But they overdid the job. If
they went out visiting for the day they
carried with them enough paraphernalia
to equip a Baby Health Centre. Not
content with carrying the infant’s rations,
they also brought saucepans, jugs and
spoons, lest germs should lurk in their
friends’ kitchen utensils, waiting to spring
out on their ewe-lamb. When the nipper
reached the age of three or four, his con-
dition began to worry them, so a doctor
was called in. His diagnosis didn’t take
long—malnutrition.

“Junius Jr.”: I hope Frankie Forde
always gets as truthful a reply when he
calls for a report as one I heard him re-
ceive, Before embarkation for the
islands we were lined up at Townsville
for inspection by the Army Minister.
Owing to a breakdown in transport, he
was late in arriving, and the long wait in
the hot sun did not improve the mob’s
temper. Walking along the ranks, Frank
pulled up at a young chap near me and
inquired affably “Well, I suppose you’ve
been waiting for this for a long time?”
“Yes,” said the young fellow sullenly.
“Nearly two hours.”

“King’s Pawn”: What standards do the
press-boys employ in their selection of
news to wire from their own city to
other States? The recent radio ’ chess-
match in which the Australian players in
Sydney and Melbourne defeated a crack
French team in Paris and Marseilles
might be regarded as big news. Apart
from other considerations, the transmis-
sions were a triumph for Australian Beam
engineers, who handled the world’s
longest-distance match without a hitch.
It was Australia’s first participation in
an international chess-match and, as a
congratulation from America said, “Aus-
tralia in one stride has entered the ranks
of the big chess-playing countries.”
Sydney and Melbourne papers gave the
event plenty of space, but the lads who
go through the copy before publication
to select bits for their papers in other
capitals evidently missed its importance.
From two State capitals the Chess
Associations had to wire to the Chess
Federation secretary for results,

“Bondi Beachcomber”: I was walking
along a dark street when a young woman
approaching from the opposite direction
stopped six yards off. “Stop! ” she cried,
and produced something which glistened
menacingly in the moonlight. I stopped,
waiting for the army of thugs I imagined
would leap from the shadows. None
came. The lady carefully manoeuvred her-
self in a semicircle to the middle of the
road, then back to the footpath some
yards behind me. Replacing the knife or
whatever it was in her handbag, she ran
on her way, while my heartbeats returned
to normal, I’m all for ladies protecting
themselves in dark streets, but this one
must have had an adventurous journey
if she went though the same routine with
every pedestrian she met.

“Exkewex”: “Jasby’s” lance-jack (B.
10/7/’46) reminds me of Barney, whose
sense of dignity grew proportionately to
the amount of grog consumed. A 1914
Digger, he had a two-figure number in
the last show and I first met him when,
as a lately transferred sergeant, I had
charge of an evening-meal parade at
which he turned up late. “Sharjunt,” he
requested, holding his figure a lot steadier
than his voice, “jus’ call the troops to
attention, please. There’s no corp. on this
parade and I’m definitely the senior,
private present.”

“Gresham”: According to cables, the
Hungarian pengo has reached one hun-
dred thousand billion trillion to the pound
sterling, I don’t believe it. To express
that figure in numerals requires 1, fol-
lowed by 35 noughts. There wouldn’t be
room for them on the notes, even if the
State Printing Office had enough noughts
in its press. Three years ago the
total pengos in circulation (coin-
age and notes) could be expressed
with the use of only nine noughts.
On the present figures anyone
with a perfectly good farthing to
invest could, in theory at any
rate, take over the whole Hun-
garian National Debt, savings
banks deposits. State railways, the
year’s exports, and all the house
and factory property in Hungary.
His main difficulty would be in
getting his change, as the value of
his farthing in pengos would be
1 and 32 noughts. Incidentally,
the pengo itself was born of in-
flation ; instituted 20 years ago, it
represented 12,500 paper coronas.
Any country that calls its unit of
currency by such a ridiculous
name as pengo deserves to see its finances
go to pot.

“Oliver Filter”: There’s no rest for
heroes once the fierce limelight of the
Press is turned on them—even canine
heroes aren’t exempt. Paddy, the Alsatian
who helped to save a little boy from
drowning (“The Falcon,” B. 17/7/’46), has
received a medal from the R.S.P.C.A.
The presentation took place at a
toney Sydney hash-house, was reported
in all the dailies, and the modest hero
was forced to pose for photographs with
his paws on the Society’s 73rd birthday
cake. Paddy—his stud-book name is
Brutus of Kerryvale—is doomed now.
Next thing he’ll be given a screen test,
Hollywood will grab him to play the title
role in a life-story of Rin-tin-tin, he’ll
have a series of ro-mances, and he’ll end
up by being brained with a bottle swung

“Pip”: Forgetful travellers? The chap
who left £lOOO in notes in a Victorian
train is in a class of his own.
He had come down from Shepparton
■bo transact business in Melbourne.
The deal fell through, and on the home
journey he called into Seymour refresh-
ment room for a bite. Then off he went
blissfully on his way leaving the boodle
under one of the tables, where it was
found by the manager’s wife. Th e
cash was in a kitbag, and on top of it
rested a loaded revolver. The forgetful
traveller got his thousand pounds back,
but on charges of having an unregis-
tered pistol and carrying it without a
permit he copped fqrty quid. A thousand
pounds is a bit out of the ordinary, but
an average of two purses is found in
Victorian trains every day. Frequently
they contain a tenner or more,
AFFLATUS.
What makes a genuine poet, Dad?
What gives a chap the status
That Tennyson and Wordsworth had?
Well, far as I can judge, my lad,
It’s what they call afflatus. «
No bays around our brows we’ll twine,
No laurel wreaths await us.
Beyond the pale, without the line,
We linger, lacking that divine
Boon that is termed afflatus.
It blows from where the Muses set
Their magic apparatus;
A breeze from off Parnassus let
That many crave but few may get,
That’s, in a word, afflatus.
You must he preordained at birth
A bard, poeta natus.
Before you’re ever reckoned worth
A sniff of what’s so rare on earth,
A touch of real afflatus.
Between the crowd where we belong
And all the master sons of song
Is interposed a barrier strong,
A definite hiatus.
Though metre never means a lot
To them, and rhyming not a jot,
It’s plain they’ve got—what we have not—
Afflatus, son, afflatus.

“Sextant”: The old Waterhen had left
Alexandria for Tobruk, and a young
seaman was playing a piano-accordion.
Just before dusk dive-bombers came at

“Jasby”: Mention by “Captain Pintle”
(B. 24/7/’46) that the Moshulu’s run of
91 days from South Australia to Eng-
land has only once been beaten since
1920 shows how poorly the last of the
windjammers compare with the clipper
ships of last century. Wool clippers often
broke 70 days for the trip, and I fancy
the old Torrens —Joseph Conrad once
trod her decks —clocked 60 one year.
Rivalry among the wool ships was
equalled only by the competition for
first home among the China clippers
which raced across the world with car-
goes of tea. The most famous race of all
took place in 1866. On May 30 of that
year Ariel, Taeping and Serica left Foo-

“Bo”: A Sydney “cat” burglar who
had precariously scaled a drainpipe to
gain access to a second-story window ex-
pended one of his “lives” in peculiar
fashion. He was disturbed by the lady of
the flat, and started to decamp. Instead
of screaming and pulling the clothes over
her head she leaped out of bed and went
after him. Seeing the thief was bidding
fair to make his getaway, the lady hoisted
a full bottle of brandy from a tray-mobile
and let fly with it. He must have dodged,
because it hit him fair on the dome. A
regrettable feature about the incident is
that a lot of good brandy went to waste.
If that burglar has any nous, next time
a dame heaves her household chattels at
him he will stand perfectly still.

“Pawang”: What Freud said (B.
17/7/’46) was that no mistake is innocent
—all are unconsciously motivated. The
classic example was the one he himself
made when, wanting to see the Rem-
brandts at Amsterdam and not wanting to
visit his brother in Paris, he failed to see
the Paris train on the Brussels station
and missed it, and then saw the Amster-
dam train, so got what he unconsciously
wanted. The difference between Fieud
and most other people is that he started
worrying about it, and it was his worry-
ing about it that started him on the path
of his discoveries in the realm of the
unconscious. The average citizen makes
similar mistakes daily, but never doubts
their innocence, a la the geology pro-
fessor, who, wishing to describe the stony
shores of an island he was approaching
as being littered with “erratic blocks,”
wrote “I noticed that the beach was
covered with erotic blacks.”

shallow crates containing one layer of
eggs packed loosely in sand. The crates
were carefully disposed in warm spots
near the ship’s funnel, and, next morning
on arrival in Singapore, 1 found that the
eggs had hatched during the night.
Freight on eggs was just half of the
freight on chickens.

A sufferer defends his fellows:
As an ex-victim from asthma, I can assure
“Nakh” (B. 10/7/’46) that those who have
never had the wretched complaint cannot visual-
ise what it is like. From childhood I suf-
fered from chronic colds; removal of tonsils,
nose operations and other treatments brought
no relief. Later the colds gave way to attacks
akin tQ severe influenza . as % result T cou i dn ’t
hold a city job and finally went outback. There
I enjoyed good health as long as I kept as
far from human contacts as possible, but if 1
went to a dance or anywhere else where human
beings congregated, travelled in a train or went
to the city for a holiday the old symptoms re-
turned at once and I was a shivering, pasty-
faced, red-eyed wreck. Came to the city to
enlist in 1941; became ill within a few days.
Saw a doctor ; be ran his finger across
tbe bare sk j n G f m y c hest and a red and angry
weal arose at once. He sent me to a specialist.
Skin tests showed I was allergic to the dander
of human hair and skin, feathers and street
dust. He started a course of injections to de-
sensitise me; within three months 1 knew what
it was like to be born again. For the first
time since childhood 1 breathed freely through
my nose; gone were all the stuffed-up head, in-
flamed eyes, lassitude and chills which were once
inseparable from life in a city. Have been
desensitised twice since and have had nothing
worse than a common cold or two since Christ-
mas, 1941, though forced to herd with thou-
sands of human beings in the Army. In
America people are allergic to the pollen of
ragweed, a plant which is a pest there. Whole
“That's enough for this morning, Miss Trim —you may relax now!"
communities are stricken at times; factories in

psychological complaint. Today nothing so
annoys me as the sight of non-allergic people
laughing at the misery of somebody who is
coughing, gasping and choking because a cat is
brought into the room, or ignorantly referring
to somebody who is sneezing and running tears
in the presence of wattle blossom as a psycho-
logical case. It’s about as psychological as
malaria.

the transport congestion, but people seem

“L. de R”: No, “Viz.” (B. 17/7/’46).
The point I tried to make was that the
arbitrary spelling of English words makes
them symbols which have no more rela-
tion to the sounds an Englishman, a Scot
or an American gives them than the
Chinese character. The Chinese character
was once a picture of the object symbol-
ised ; “man” still has its two legs, though
it has lost its arms and head. I have often
listened to a class of Chinese youngsters
yelling in unison. They learn by rote
precisely as our own youngsters do. But
they have the advantage that their char-
acters don’t ape the sounds. English
spelling bears some resemblance to the
spoken lingo, but it is generally so remote
as to make confusion worse confounded.

“Redfern”: Discussing one evening the

reading more than 25 years ago Ann
Veronica on the beach at Kurnell
(N.S.W.). Tess of the D’Urbervilles I
read at Oakdale, a fruit-growing district
on the road to the Burragorang Valley.
A book of essays by Lafcadio Hearn was
read one Sunday afternoon at Kurrajong,
Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle at Berowra,
Borrow’s Lavengro at Leura and Le
Sage’s Gil Bias at Collaroy. During the
same period I must have read hundreds
of books at home, the contents of some
of which I can recall more vividly than
the ones quoted, yet I have no recollec-
tion of the actual reading. I was puzzled

“Puyyaka”: Why should a smack on
nose s t ar t a flow of blood from the
„ nnnt a much harrW
average snout whereas a much harder
clout on an ear or eye results only
in braising or surface abrasion? The
explanation is that the nose-interior pos-
sesses a large and complicated blood-
supply system, whose delicate vessels are
easily broken ; the twofold purpose of the
liberal blood-supply is to warm the enter-
ing air and to extract any dust and
bacteria which it contains. So efficient is
the latter process, as scientific tests show,
that the air in a crowded room soon be-
comes almost free of bacteria owing to the
collection by the noses of the inmates of
the suspended matter on which they are
conveyed. The world’s biggest-nosed
races are the Semitic peoples, who have
evolved their characteristic hooked beaks
in order to catch the fine dust of their
original desert, and the Nordic stocks
whose broad, straight gnomons provide
a maximum area of warming-surface for
the icy breezes of an Arctic winter.

“Lord Luvus”: According to Major-
General Farrell, one of the Bikini obser-
sers, the atom bomb is only at the begin-
ning of its development; bigger and better
ones can be expected, and those already
in existence are large enough singly to
destroy any ordinary city. The statement
sets me pondering on the fact that this is
the age, not only of bigger and bigger
atom bombs, but of bigger and bigger
Empires, and I can’t help reflecting on the
fate of the dinosaurs. These reptiles of
gigantic size and tiny brains dominated
the planets for ages. Then some little
animal, which was better adapted to the
changed conditions because his tradition
was smallness, came along and inherited
their pastures. Possibly the world that
the major-general won’t see will consist
of such tiny nations that none of them
will be able to afford to make atom
bombs and, the big ones having blown
one another to pieces, the atom bomb will
have automatically provided its own
solution.

“Libra”: A correspondent in an Ade-
laide paper suggests that, in emulation or
the American intention to carry back
to the U.S.A. the bodies of all Ameri-
cans killed in the war, Australia should
undertake a similar project with our own
dead. It would be quite out of step with
all British sentiment regarding those who
die in their country’s service. It is one
of the glories of our race that its sons
sleep in every land; 'that their bones are
washed by every sea. Even in this age
of materialism and debunking surely there
is more nobility and beauty in the “some
corner of a foreign field” notion than m
the Chinese custom of carrying shiploads
of corpses home for burial. The War
Graves Commission sees to it that war
cemeteries abroad are well cared tor.
Can this always be said of private graves
at home? To those who lost loved ones
in the war, Libya, Malaya, New Guinea

WHAT A QUESTION!
“Mr. Oalwell, Minister of Information, expressed
himself amazed and confounded to learn that one of
his departmental officers had issued a questionnaire to
boys under 16 in a number of Victorian schools con-
taining the query ‘Have you any steady girl friend?
So, Bill or Jack or Jim or Tom or Eddie,
You were expected frankly to assert
Whether, despite your tender age, already
You’d shown yourself sufficiently alert
And up to date to have conceived a steady
Attachment to some piquant bit of skirt,
Pigtailed perhaps, and bobby-soxed as well,
But not a bit the less susceptible.
Was there, they asked, no radiant apparition,
Flapper or, preferably, fiapperette.
To waken in your breast a premonition
Here was a girl with whom you’d like to get
In much the same delectable condition
As Romeo concerning Juliet,
Or Abelard along of Heloise,
Or any pair of turtle-doves you please?
Had you no adolescent Dulcinea,
The sort that youthful chivalry secures
To be a stand-by and a panacea
In aught untoward that a lad endures?
No maid whose heart, you had a firm idea,
Beat in an even unison with yours?
No name was necessary. All you’d got
To say was whether there was one or not.
Had you not lit upon in your vicinity
When school was out or, quite as likely, in,
Some charmer with a touch of that divinity
Characteristically feminine,
And savored the mysterious affinity
Between two souls discovering they’re twin
That poets have romantically sung
With ardor ever since the world was young?
In short, didv you possess a tried and trusty
Girl friend? Supposing that you did confess,
Though some old notions need to be adjusted
Concerning juvenile precociousness,
This Nosey Parker wouldn’t have been disgusted
Had you replied with an emphatic Yes.
The very naivete that he employs
Suggests he thinks it quite O.K. —for boys.

THE SERVICE MAN
Forgotten Men in Japan.
“Ek Dum”: In its “arrangements” for
the comfort and recreation of the officers
and men of the occupation force in Japan
“Labor” has run true to form.
Its treatment of troops almost every-
where has drawn bitter protests, but its
boastings of what it proposed to do for
the occupation contingent left the impres-
sion that it had learnt its lesson and would
take seriously its responsibilities there.
These were infinitely greater because the
occupation contingent had the task of up-
holding not only the prestige of Aus-
tralia among a conquered people but the
reputation of the whole British Common-
wealth among strongly competing allies,
one at least very keenly observant of
Australian military standards and dis-
cipline.
Before these troops even left Australia
there were grumbles, particularly on the
subject of the uniform. Since then visitors
to Japan have returned appalled at con-
ditions, but as it appears to be the custom
of Australian visitors abroad to be
appalled at the arrangements their “Gov-
ernment” makes, not much notice was
taken.
However, a letter from General North-
cott, who retired from the command of
British Commonwealth troops in Japan
when named N.S.W. Governor-elect,
places the position question. The
letter was quoted by Alderman Chandler,
the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, as having
been addressed to the Australian
“No smoking — it's dangerous!”
Comforts Fund. General Northcott
wrote:
I am concerned that these men should
have the maximum recreational facilities in
their camps, which are, almost without ex-
ception, in burnt-out and devastated areas,
and which completely lack normal ameni-
ties. I use the term “in their camps” to
underline to your committee the fact that
conditions which existed in the jungle
virtually exist now. Taking a conservative
estimate of the period of occupation as
three years, total funds required are
£45,000. I therefore earnestly request your
committee to make a grant to fulfil a
pressing need.
Alderman Chandler .said that for years
“Labor” had shown no consideration for
the soldier. He declared that food supply
in the islands was so bad that it had be-
come a public scandal; so bad, indeed,
that it had even forced admissions to that
effect from Mr. Forde.
“And now,” the Lord Mayor continued,
“we have this letter from General
Northcott, which will be a revela-
tion to the people. The Australian
force is living outside one of the
two cities which were atom-bombed.
They have poor housing and food,
and no amenities; no organised
sport facilities, no real opportunities of
enjoying entertainment.... Had these
troops been a group of "wharflaborers or
other unionists, every possible amenity
would have been provided for them;
hundreds of thousands of pounds was
provided during the war for men who
already had all the comforts of civilisa-
tion. But these soldiers, who are up-
holding our prestige abroad, have noth-
ing.”
The Comforts Fund sent two commis-
' sioners to Japan to investigate General
Northcott’s report. The report they made
was so horrible and revolting that the
Comforts Fund has reconsidered its first
decision that the supply of occupation
facilities should be left to the Government.
The Government has done nothing. Some-
body must undertake the task.
The scandal is the more glaring in view
of the fact that Mr. Chifley himself
visited Japan and the troops.
Of course Mr. Forde called for a
report. It seems to have been supplied
by Mr. McKerihan, president of ,the
N.S.W. Rural Bank and Federal Admini-
strator of the A.C.F., who “indicated” to
Mr. Forde that “reports of lack of
amenities were unwarranted and mislead-
ing,” proving it by asking his board
for £45,000 for “cafeterias and non-resi-
dent clubs,” foui’ of which had been
provided, while equipment for others had
arrived or was on the way. “Leave
centres” to accommodate “650 personnel”
and “buffet trains” had also, or were to
be, provided. Mr. Forde had also “dis-
cussed amenities at length with General
Northcott,” but the drift and substance
of the discussion he did not reveal.
But this Minister made one artless
revelation which is characteristic and
significant:
With the ending of lend-lease American
amenities were withdrawn from troops of
other nations in Japan, and there has been
some delay in replacing them.
It might have been made the occasion
for another “without any inhibitions”
message. “Without any inhibitions we
appeal to the Yanks to go on doing for
our officers and men what we didn’t think
to do for them ourselves.”
Second Bikini Test.
“Oliver Filter”: The two atom bombs
exploded at Bikini —the first on July 1—
had at least three things in common.
Both produced the same characteristic
mushroomlike pillar of cloud, both did
less damage than “famous correspond-
ents” predicted, and both blew Sydney

different matter from explosion in mid-
air—the enclosing waters give a force a
foothold, as it were, and it lashes out
with a much greater punch. The first
Bikini bomb sank five light or medium
vessels ; the second accounted for some
heavier stuff. The food craft from
which the bomb was suspended naturally
vanished immediately.
The large ship closest to the explo-
sion was the 26,000-ton battleship
Arkansas, completed in 1912 and recon-
structed in 1927. She went down, stern
first, in a few minutes. The 33,000-ton
carrier Saratoga, completed in 1927, sank
seven and a half hours later, and an oil
tender and three submarines went to the
bottom. Ships damaged included the
battleships New York and Nagato,
the cruisers Pensacola and Salt Lake City,
the destroyer Hughes and the transport
Fallon.
Generally, the second Bikini explosion
seemed to confirm the results of the first
—that blast and radio burns are the most
evil effects of the bomb ; that it is as
much an anti-personnel weapon as any-
thing, and that its effect on morale could
be as telling as its physical effects. The
tests at Bikini were not, as some corre-
spondents seemed to think, a bigger and
better fireworks display aimed at sink-
ing as many ships as possible. They
were a carefully planned scientific ex-
periment to discover what battleships
could withstand, what modifications they
require and what effects the atom bomb
has on a collection of materials, organic
and inorganic—the test ships were
crammed with everything from animals to
radio equipment, from paints to protective
ointments. It will be months before full
results of the experiments are known.
The bombs certainly didn’t prove the
obsolescence of navies or any other like
nonsense —as long as man moves on land,
sea and in the air his need for navies,
armies and air forces will remain, no
matter what weapons are designed to
make their progress more terrible.
Russia and Tokyo.
“Ek Dum”: Russian radio stations
have been devoting more than their
usual attention to General MacArthur’s
policy. Their attitude is unfriendly.
The propaganda divides itself into two
branches. One deals with the position
on the Asiatic mainland. Moscow
the world listens for its opinions on cer-
tain phases of world politics. It sends out
a tremendous splurge of nonsense which
skates along the edge of the subject with-
out actually clarifying it. Then a few
sharp and arresting sentences, sometimes
very rude, are slipped in.
The general purport of these disjointed
sentences at the present time is that
Manchuria has been “safeguarded” by
being stripped of munitions, industrial
plants and supplies, because if this step
had not been taken some Fascist in-
fluences —unnamed, but quite obviously
intended to be interpreted as British —
might crush further the “colonial slaves
of imperialism.” Therefore Russia —
irrespective of agreements, of course —
has put these “resources” out of harm’s
way. The Japanese prisoners in Russian
hands, it is suggested, are being kept be-
cause they wish to stay behind and learn
the doctrines of the brotherhood of man,
and particularly because they fear that
they might be “enslaved” to fight the
battles of brutal Fascism or might be
“persecuted.”
In Korea, it is suggested, the popula-
tion has been converted in bulk to Com-
munism and prefers Russian to Ameri-
can methods.
The position in Japan is that the Rus-
sians, with virtually no responsibility for
the management of the country, have a
delegation in Tokyo larger than all the
other delegations. Nobody knows what
the army of gloomy fellows does or what
its purpose is, but it grows.
It has a busy press bureau which is
given over to Communist propaganda
when not devoted to setting the
Japanese against the Allied Admini-
stration by devious means. Its propa-
ganda is growing rather in basic resources
than in actuality. At the present stage
it appears to be engaged in assaying and
boring operations, to determine the re-
sistance content of General MacArthur
and the absorbent qualities of the
Japanese people. This is in direct opposi-
tion to the general Allied policy and to
the orders which most Allied missions
have received. For its own purposes the
Russian mission, moreover, seeks to
draw on Allied funds in Japan. , This
looks somewhat like asking the turkey to
sharpen the axe.
Its requisition in April was next to
nothing, in May 6,000,000-odd yen, in
June 9,000,000 yen. All attempts to dis-
cover how this huge sum is to be spent
have failed. The Muscovites ask for a
blank cheque. So General MacArthur
closed down supplies pending some ex-
planation.
Moscow immediately countered with
a demand for the suppression of all
Fascist, militaristic and anti-Allied propa-
ganda.
The sting is in the tail of this demand.
Anything which is not in line with world
Communist policy is anti-Russian, and,
therefore, anti-Ally. Anything which is
in favor of the Chinese National Gov-
ernment, in certain phases, is classified
in the same way. But General Mac-
Arthur is proving a tough nut to crack.
So the Russians are busy in the Kuriles,
where the Red Army is ensconced on a
large scale, and where the population is
supposedly engaged in continual rejoic-
ing at its liberation from the yoke of the
Japanese, to whom most of its inhabi-
tants are related by blood and race.
Horror in the Holy City.
“Ek Dum”: Events in Palestine, com-
bined with the provocative attitude of
Moscow, intensify the blackness of the
international outlook.
The Palestinian outrage smacks of
Communist terrorist technique. The
terrorists stole into the King David
Hotel, so well known to many A.I.F.
men, overpowered the guards and blew
up most of the hotel with fused bombs
which they set in the basement.
The method employed was exactly
that which has been applied from time
to time in the Balkans. The outrage was
on all fours with the blowing up of Sofia
Cathedral in 1925, an enterprise carried
out under the personal direction of the
secretary-general of the Comintern, a
Bulgarian Jew named Kolarow, whose
signature authorises the original charter
of the Australian Communist party, and
who now is virtually Russian Governor
of Bulgaria.
The Jerusalem terrorists had the same
sort of bad luck as the Bulgarian Com-
munists, though they exacted a bloody
toll of innocent victims almost as great
as that of Sofia,
In Sofia it had been planned, by min-
ing the cathedral before the funeral of
a murdered Minister, to destroy the King
and his entourage and the whole of the
military command. But sickness kept
two of the military commanders away,
and the King was absent at the funeral
of his aide-de-camp and escaped. But
123 victims —largely innocent women and
children —were buried in a common
grave.
In Jerusalem the bloody-handed
ruffians who arranged the bombing were
unfortunate in that they missed killing
the British High Commissioner, General
Cunningham, of Abyssinian campaign
fame, and General Barker, the British
G.O.C. But the loss of life was terrible.
Most of the central portion of the
splendid building in which the British
command and administration had its
headquarters was blown sky-high, and
106 persons—some high officials, some
lowly and with no responsibility whatever
for British or any other policy, some
long-standing friends of the Jews, some
Jewish by birth and religion—were
destroyed and 46 injured.
The rescuers found victims pinned in
the debris, these including the Assistant
Chief-Secretary, Mr 1 . D. Thompson.
The only element in the world which
seemed able to approve the terrible affair
was Moscow, which depicted what had
happened as “the natural outcome of
British proceedings in the suppression of
the freedom of an unwilling people.”
The fiendish outrage will do immense
harm to the Jewish cause in Palestine,
and came as a tremendous blow to
those persons in America and other
countries, Australia included, who have
been backing the Palestinian agitators
through thick and thin.
It will also have a general effect on
British policy throughout the Middle
East.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Lieutenant-General John Northcott, on
whose shoulders the mantle of Lachlan
Macquarie falls this week, is the first
Australian to become Governor of an
Australian State, although James
Mitchell, as Lieutenant-Governor, has
occupied the Perth Government House
since 1933. General Northcott is
the first serving soldier appointed to
Sydney Government House since 1855,
when Lieutenant-Colonel Denison, of the
Royal Engineers, took over the post,
although Robinson and Carrington had
had some military experience in their
GOVERNOR.
youth, and Wakehurst was a Gallipoli
veteran, Hore-Ruthven’s distinguished
military career was several years behind
him when he came to N.S.W. from South
Australia. The new Governor, after
commanding the Armored Division and
2nd Aus. Corps, became C.G.S. Aus-
tralian and Allied Land Forces in 1942,
and was last year appointed G.O.C.
British Commonwealth Forces in Japan.
He assumes the vice-regal dignity at 56.
Landing burning aircraft and getting
away with it is a habit of Flying-Officer
B. D. Bancroft, of Pennant Hills, Sydney,
who has been awarded the George Cross
for his second effort. He was pilot of
a Dakota transport taking gliding equip-
ment from India to Southern Burma with
a crew of four and three passengers
when he crashed the burning aircraft in
Southern India. He dragged the other
victims free from the burning aircraft
and walked four miles through very
rough country for help. He gained the
D.F.C. for a similar stunt when he
brought a damaged Halifax back to Eng-
land from a bombing raid over Ger-
many and landed it in spite of fire. Both
jobs cost him a spell in hospital.
T. W. White, M.H.R. for Balaclava,
suspended from the House of Reps, for a
week after a clash with Speaker Rose-
vear, was a Bulletin paragraphist—he
wrote under the nom-de-plume of “Avis”
—before World War I. After getting into
khaki in 1914 he continued his writings
and sent reams of copy from the Persian
Gulf, where he was stationed as an air-
man, including a delightful story of a
performance of Shakspeare with varia-
tions at Basra. When he was taken
prisoner by the Turks, The Bulletin
expressed its regrets that it wouldn’t be
hearing anything from him for a while.
Not long after a small'cylindrical parcel
arrived addressed to “Mr. E. Ditor, 214
George-street, Sydney.” It turned out to
be a sheet of paper several feet wide
with half a dozen lines of writing across
its width. The Turks had limited letters
to six lines and had forbidden them to
write direct to newspapers. That was
how Tom got over the difficulty of getting
in touch with The Bulletin. He eventu-
ally escaped from the Turks and wrote a
fine book. Guests of the Unspeakable,
based on his experiences. When the late
S. H. Prior received news of his escape
he remarked “It’s what I expected. Re-
member his father was a locksmith in
Little Collins-street.”
Blackmarketeers are believed to be re-
sponsible for the burning of W. F. J.
McCann’s house —investigation showed
that it had been deliberately lit in five or
six places. McCann is Deputy Prices
Commissioner in S.A. and he received
threatening letters and ’phone calls be-
fore and after the fire. Threats are not
likely to worry the man who joined the
10th Battalion in August, 1914, was one
of its C.S.Ms. at “the Landing,” won his
commission four months later and finished
up the war as C.O. of the 10th, collect-
ing as he went a D. 5.0., 0.8. E., M.C.
and bar, two mentions in dispatches and
a couple of wounds.
“Becks” on an ex-ambassador:
John Gilbert Winant, U.S. delegate to U.N.O.
Economic and Social Council, is no stranger to
the type of problem the council has to deal
with. He went to Geneva as delegate to 1.L.0.
in 1935, and during the next few years was
assistant-director and, later, director of the
organisation. Sandwiched in somewhere be-
tween those jobs was a spell as first chairman
of the Roosevelt Social Security Board. Earlier
he had been Governor of New Hampshire for
three terms, during which that State introduced
much social legislation which anticipated by
several years similar Federal enactments. Earlier
still he had been a graduate of Princeton, a
campaigner for Theodore Roosevelt in I eddy’s
unsuccessful 1912 campaign, a student and
teacher of history and, in World War I, a
squadron-leader in France. Hitler’s war found
him at Geneva, but early in 1941 he was sent
to London as American Ambassador. The story
of His stay in Britain is best told in the words
of prominent Britons when he left a few months
ago.
Said Churchill: “Mr. Winant has always
given us the feeling, impossible to resist, how
gladly he would give his life to see the good
cause triumph. He is a friend of Britain, but
he is more than a friend of Britain —he is a
friend of justice, freedom and truth.” Said
Bevin: “He shared our sorrows and our rations
and never once would he allow himself to go
beyond what the Britisher had to go through
during that period.” Eden: “Winant can look
back upon an embassy which has few paral-
lels and which is nowhere surpassed in the re-
corded history of our two peoples.” Winant
himself said he had never felt himself a foreigner
in Britain. He would always feel himself a
Londoner. He felt he had really lived the most
of his life in the years he had spent there.
If there is such a thing as racial
memory, Eugene Goossens, British con-
ductor, sketched here by Mcßeath, ought
to feel at home in the Fitzroy Gardens,''
Melbourne, where Captain Cook’s cottage
stands. On his mother’s side he is de-
scended from the navigator whose father
built the cottage. From the same source
Goossens is descended from still another
figure in Australian maritime exploration
—Captain Furneaux. In the process of
conducting concerts he has seen some
blue water himself, having crossed the
Atlantic 36 times. His love of the; sea
he attributes to his inheritance from these
two seafaring worthies, but his ability in
repartee is probably native to him.

press interview in Melbourne, he pricked
his ears up when a woman reporter
blurted: “Have you ever struck a woman
conductor, Mr. Goossens?” “Good
Heavens, no!” retorted the virtuoso.
“Why should I want to hurt them?”
Return of Max Meldrum as a trustee
of the Melbourne National Gallery fol-
lowing on the retirement through sickness
of Napier Waller, the one-armed Digger
artist, caused the usual rumpus in the
newspapers, Chief-Secretary Slater being
accused of having made the appointment
without calling, so to speak, for public
tenders. Slater, who admires Meldrum’s
work, retorted that there was no need
when a man of Meldrum’s capabilities
was available. Meldrum preceded his
appointment with a speech at Castle-
maine in which he made a hot attack
on modern art, with some pointed refer-
ences to recent purchases by the Gal-
lery of which he is again a trustee.
“Craiser”: Every Australian city has
its sightless people who astonish citizens
by the confident way they get about in
trains, trams and across busy intersec-
tions, without assistance. F. R. Chapman,
chairman of directors of a British firm
of importers, now visiting Australia, is
even more unusual. He claims to be able
to find his way about any Australian city,
from North Queensland to Westralia,
without any of the traditional aids
to the blind. He has done 15 trips from
England to these parts and can “feel” in-
stantly any Australian town he is put
down in. An acute visual memory since
he lost his sight enables him to do it.
An ojd key-tapper writes:
Although Cable and Wireless has become or
is on the eve of becoming a nationalised service
it is likely to be manned for a long time by
the men who laid and worked the cables
years before political interference was thought
of. Four Australians will shortly proceed to
Asian stations as managers over districts
where they previously had as dreadful experi-
ences as any human being had ever suffered.
George Lawrie, of Adelaide, who was super-
intendent of Labuan when the Japs arrived,
and had third-degree methods vainly applied
to him to make him work the cables, returns
to that station. J, T. Ryder, of Sydney, who
barely survived his internment in Java, goes
to Batavia and E. T. E. Meredith, who escaped
the Japs for three months in Borneo and then
starved for three years at Kuching, reopens
the Hong Kong station. G. J. Feakes, of
Sydney, goes as manager to Penang. He was
in Singapore during the evacuation. Ordered
to embark, he decided to return to the office to
see if anything further could be done there and
missed the escape ship. He spent three years
at Changi. The ship he should have caught
was bombed and, of twelve of his colleagues
aboard, only one has since been heard of.
Most ex-servicemen found their war-
time taste of the tropics sufficient to last
a lifetime, but some are looking for
more. Bill Forster, who went to Malaya
with 2/19 Battalion and spent years
in a Jap prison camp, is going back
there to establish a business, and takes
with him Edmund Coleman, who as a
R.A.A.F. man flew on numerous sorties
over New Guinea and the islands. The
two were studying Arts at Sydney Uni.
under the rehab, scheme when the urge
to go north came to them. They managed
to secure several agencies, and have left
on the venture in high hopes and high
spirits. Forster is a son of H. Gregory
Forster, secretary of Northern Collieries.
Tassie’s Deputy Director of Posts and
Telegraphs, John Elliot Monfries, at 72,
is still going strong after 57 years with the
P.M.G.’s Department—a long-service
record. Born at Gumeracha (S.A.), he
joined the local P.O. as a messenger, but
soon stepped up to become junior tele-
graph operator at G.P.0., Adelaide. He
was clerk in the accounts branch in 1900,
when Federation made State postal ser-
vices a Commonwealth concern; hence
the retiring age of 65 does not affect him.
Monfries was S.A. representative on the
staff of central administration, Mel-
bourne, in 1901, and returned to Adelaide
as chief clerk in 1914, thence to a
similar post in Sydney 10 years later, be-
fore crossing Bass Strait to his present
post in 1928. He’s an old-time cricketer
and lacrosse player for Victoria and S.A.
A. V. Thompson, who can book his
passage for Canberra to succeed Makin,
had to win from 20 other aspiring law-
makers the nomination for the safe Labor
seat in Hindmarsh (S.A.). Makin has
enjoyed it for 26 years. Thompson sits
in S.A. Assembly for part of the same
electorate, and was returned unopposed
at the last election. He is a member of
the Housing Commission, and popular.
Pianist Noel Mewton-Wood, who,
when still in his ’teeps, performed the
feat of conducting an orchestra at the
Town Hall, Melbourne, has made good
in England. He recently played the solo
part in the first performance in London
of Prokofiev’s Eighth Sonata and is billed
to do the same for Benjamin Britton’s
new concerto, with the composer in the
rostrum Not bad going for a lad still
in the early twenties. Some of his music
will be heard in Australian theatres with
the release of “Tawny Pipit,” an English
picture.
Recently a “Red Page” writer made a
plea for several sorely-needed Australian
reference books and included in his list
a national biographical dictionary. Angus
and Robertson have arranged with Perci-
val Serle to publish such a work. Serle has
been engaged on the project for a number
of years and it is nearing completion.
His most important contribution to
Australian literature is his Biblio-
graphy of Australasian Poetry and
Verse, published in 1925. An Australasian
Anthology, which he edited jointly with
R. H. Croll and F. Wilmot in 1927, was
recently revised. After 20 years in a life-
assurance office and then chief clerk and
accountant at the Melbourne University
Serle retired a quarter of a century ago to
devote his time to literary research work.
Colin Cowan, drawn here by Prior,
hails from Paisley, where, in addition to
shawls, they make good ships, good en-
gines and good engineers. He served in
the Boer War as a trooper in the Imperial
Yeomanry and came to Australia a few
years later, joining Burns Philp as an
engineer. He’s still with them and has
just been awarded the 0.8. E. “for meri-
torious sea service in the South West
Pacific Area with the merchant service.”
The citation, of course, refers to the war
years, but Cowan’s service as chief en-
ENGINEER.
gineer extends over 35 years. During
the first war he kept Morinda’s propellers
turning; the last one found him pushing
Montoro along. At 64 he is as well
known at B.P. ports of call as the Mon-
toro herself and has a host of friends
in the islands.
Into the silence:
In London, George Gollin, an original
member of Gollin and Co., of Adelaide. He
opened the Melbourne branch in 1889 and the
London branch in 1904. He retired in England
in 1922.
In Brisbane, at 91, John Mowbray, bom at
East Brisbane, in the area now known as Mow-
bray Park. His father was the first Presbyterian
minister in Victoria.
In Melbourne, at 64, George Herbert Cow-
ling, professor of English at Melbourne Uni-
versity. Born in England, he served in the Great
War and canie to Melbourne from Leeds Uhi-
versity. He published an original work on the
dialects of Yorkshire, and edited editions of
Shakspeare, Chaucer, Blake and Shelley.
In Melbourne, Mrs. Amy Marguerite Frances
Osborne, widow of Harry Osborne, of Curran-
dooley station, N.S.W. She was the eldest
daughter of former Chief Justice Madden;
sisters are Mrs. M. H. Baillieu and Mrs. Louis
Nelkin.
In Adelaide, at 83, the Rev. T. G. White,
born in Vic., but in S.A. for the last half-
century. Had been secretary and president of
the Methodist Conference, and was prominent
as a church architect.
At Dunedin, M.L., at 88, Willi Eels, to whose
benefactions of works of literature and art the
Scotch by terian city is indebted. His gifts to
the Dunedin Museum total close on £25,000;
Polynesian, Melanesian, Maori and Oriental
collections made by him found their way to
Dunedin institutions. Pels was a classical
scholar and gathered a vast collection of Greek
and Roman coins and medals.
In Sydney, Mrs. B. E. Minns, widow of
The Bulletin artist who was unequalled in the
depiction of the Australian abo.
In Brisbane, at 83, John G. Warren, Queens-
land’s oldest practising conveyancer, last foun-
dation member of the Sandgate Bowling Club,
chairman of the City of Brisbane Building
Society, and a member of the Dickens Fellow-
ship, in whose activities he enjoyed portraying
Pickwick.
In Adelaide, at 83, A. H. Skinner, formerly
of the Customs and one-time president of the
Public Service Clerical Association.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Women racegoers at Moonee Valley
deemed tweed suits the best bet for the
day, with lowering skies and a nip in
the air to give the lie to the early spring
blossoms that bordered the lush lawns of
that delightful course. One pleasing suit
was in the shade a former generation
termed -“crushed strawberry.” With it
went a small felt hat in a slightly brighter
tone. Well suited to the day was Mrs.
George Mendes, whose grey suit was
worn with a matching veiled hat. The
softness of blue pastel was charmingly
displayed by Mrs. Frank Watts, who
topped it with a tailored black coat and
blue-feathered hat. Mrs. A. A. Lord,
personal secretary to Lady Dugan, chose
a black Persian lamb trimmed coat.
Latest news of Sir Winston and his popu-
lar lady is that they will return from
England in September. With Mrs, Lord
was her mother, Mrs. Dalton, over from
Tasmania on holiday. Mrs. Laver wore
her all-black ensemble with . a brilliant
cyclamen rose-trimmed hat, Audrey
Howell, of Albury, and her hostess, Mrs,
Hugh Mafsland, wore Basque berets with
their suits.
At the Firbank Old Grammarians’
Association dance at Brighton Town Hall
10 debutantes frocked in shell-pink crepe
were presented to Mrs. R. W. Tovell,
whose oyster crepe gown and bolero were
embossed with silver. President of the
Association Mrs. J. Macartney, wearing
a white crepe, gold sequin-embroidered
gown, received the official guests. In the
party were Mr. T. White, M.H.R., and
Mrs. White, headmistress of the school
Miss M. M. Cameron, senior members of
the teaching staff *and vice-presidents of
the Association Mrs. E. Toner and Misses
D. W. Tonkin and Gwen Johnson.
Honorary secretary of the Association
Mrs. E. Philpott chose a deeply-flounced
frock of midnight-blue crepe.
“Sinfonietta,” by Eugene Goossens, had
its Melbourne premiere with the Sym-
phony Orchestra, the composer conduct-
ing. Dressing of the audience was a
mixed bag ; maybe the fact that it was a
Friday night had something to do with
the casual clothes worn. Mrs. Eugene
Goossens was an exception. Always a
smart dresser, her full white cr£pe was
patterned in black with a deep band of
black crepe set in at the hemline.
Latest engagement is that of Clayton,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. C. G. Beck-
ingsaie, Allenby Place, Glen Iris, to
Anne, only daughter of Mrs. A. J.
Phillips and the late A. J. Phillips, of
Toorak. Clayton, ex-R.A.A.F., spent 2f
years as a p.-0.-w. in Germany after
having been shot down over Crete. Anne
was a petty officer in the W.R.A.N.S.;
she has since been doing kindergarten
work. Marriage will take place in the
C. of E. Grammar School Chapel in
October.
At a late-afternoon party at the Aus-
tralia a score of friends said “Good-
bye” to the popular Van Rijn couple.
Lieut. Gerald van Rijn has been recalled
to Batavia, and wife Joy will follow him
later. Secretary to the Netherlands Lega-
tion Mr. de Ranitz, Colonel Alan
Cameron, A.1.F., Pat Hoogveld, who had
been secretary to Lieut, van Rijn at the
Netherlands Government Information
Service and is now secretary to his suc-
cessor, pretty little Dutch dancer Esmee
Monod, Mrs. Harry Greenfield and Air-
Commodore Allan Walters were among
the guests.
J. A. Malcolm, Maoriland’s Trade
Commissioner in this city for the past
12 years, and his wife Jean were caught
up in a swift round of farewells prior to
leaving for Montreal, where he is taking
up his new post, via Maoriland, where
grandmother, Mrs. Mary Malcolm, is
waiting to welcome the family. At the
party given at Haeremai House, president
of the N.Z. Association presented to the
guests of honor a silver salver, engraved
in N.Z. fern fronds. As patroness of the
N.Z. branch of the Red Cross, Mrs. Mal-
colm was presented with a leather writing
case. Brigadier Tovell, M.L.A., and
Captain Curmi, Commissioner for Malta,
made speeches.
It was in a happy frame of mind that
Mrs. Wallace Mitchell greeted her guests
at a small luncheon party she was giving
for Mrs. Jack Dunstan, who was leaving
for an extended visit to Brisbane, for she
had just received a telegram telling of
elder daughter Jean’s engagement to
James Bowater Gordon, of Sydney,
youngest son of Mrs. D. V. Gordon, of
Perth, and the late Mr. G. M, Gordon.
Jean, who was the 50th W.A.A.A.F. to
enlist in Victoria, was in that service for
almost six years, rising to the rank of
flight-officer. With her sister Betty, re-
cently discharged from the A.A.M.W.S.,
she has been living in Sydney, and it was
there she met her fiance. Preparations for
a party to greet the newly-engaged pair
are in the air, for they have arrived in
Melbourne to see the whole of the family
—and it’s a large one. There are six boys
and two girls who bear the name of
Wallace Mitchell.
In’ their lovely home in Glenferrie-
road, Toorak, M. and Madame Modesti
at a late-afternoon party gave guests an
opportunity of seeing the many colorful
canvasses which later were to comprise
with others the exhibition which M.
Modesti held at George’s Gallery,
with the Minister for France, M.
Auge, as ceremony opener. Madame
Modesti, who is perhaps better known as
Madame Norma the opera
singer, wore some lovely costume
jewellery with her smart black ensemble.
Among the guests were M. Loubere, Vice-
Consul for France, Professor Maurice
Belz and his wife, who tied her smart
black hat under her chin with yards of
veiling, Mrs. Redvers Bate, who had a
yoke of glittering diamente highlighting
her simple black frock, and Rita Miller,
whose snug brown coat was trimmed with
brown marmot fur. Bonnie McCallum,
A.B.C, personality, swathed her small
brown sailor hat with veiling in deep
creamy tones. Edna Glasscock, who is
assistant to Robert Haines, Director of
George’s Gallery, chose a simple suit and
matching hat. Included in the works by
M. Dominique Modesti is a painting of
Friedlind Wagner, a descendant of the
composer. It may be recalled that
Madame Norma Gadsden achieved fame
in Europe before the war as a Wagnerian
artist.
When Associate - Professor Keith
Macartney decided to produce Shak-
speare’s “Antony and Cleopatra” for
Queen’s College, at the Union Theatre,
he set out to attain a colorful simplicity
in the presentation, with suggestion
rather than accuracy or elaboration of
costume and setting; and although, of
necessity, the play was cut, the general
shape and movement of the drama was
well sustained. Desmond Connor’s light-
ing, scenery and stage direction helped
to make this presentation a delight to the
big first-night audience. Students of the
Emily McPherson College of Domestic
Economy made the costurrjes.
To the role of Cleopatra, the
lady whom age could not, wither
and whose infinite variety even
custom couldn’t stale, Gwen Izzard, whose
portrait by Ritter-Jeppersen you see
here, brought grace and a lot of histrionic
skill. She beguiled Antony in the open-
ing scene in a long parma violet chiffon
gown with lime-green scarf as contrast.
In private life Gwen is Mrs. lan Potter.
In the audience was Leontine Sagan,
who, since she has been in Melbourne,
has seen every amateur theatrical com-
pany at work; she was accompanied by
Matt McDougall. Barbara Sellick relied
on a sparkling diamente necklace and
clips to highlight her simple black suit.
With her was Bill Ryall, well-known as
a member of the Tin Alley Players.
Among others who enjoyed the play were
Mrs. lan Morrison, who shortly leaves
with her two children for Singapore to
join her husband, who is London “Times”
representative there, and Janice Hender-
son, who recently made her debut at the
Gloucester Ball.
From Sydney
Everything is happening this week: The
new Governor is arriving, last night was
the Hector Bolitho lecture, and tomorrow
is Wattle Day!
Over 1500 people addicted to the law
went off to the Trocadero last Thursday
night, and lawyers and intending lawyers
found the ballroom and its approaches
named after the addresses of their
working day. There was the de-
positions clerk who took the cloaks
and coats. Official receivers took
the tickets, and the dullest didn’t need to
ask what was granted in the licensing
court. There was a mock trial in which
the “Chancellor” of the University was
charged with overcrowding the Law
School. In fact it was as jolly a Law
Ball as Sydney has known. There was a
judicial dispensing of music from a be-
wigged orchestra. The Lieutenant-
Governor and Lady Jordan were there,
and were welcomed by the president of
the Law Society, Bowen Thomas, and by
vice-president Gina Christie.
Party of the week for dog-lovers was
the 73rd anniversary afternoon of the
R.S.P.C.A. This was in Prince’s, and
the hundred or more guests clapped
loudly when Paddy, a brave and loving
Alsatian, was decorated for helping to save
his small master from drowning in the
Nepean. The young owner of the dog is
Russell Johnstone, and he received the
warfn smile of welcome, too. A great
iced cake, decorated with a horse and a
dog, was admired by all.
Everybody remembers the Gillespies,
who brought the real breath of the heather
to Vaucluse, where the old home and its
ballroom echoed to Scottish song and
Scottish dance. The tnoughtful-looking
lady of this picture is Mrs. H. V. Stan-
ford London (formerly Jean Gillespie),
and she, of course, is very active about
the Folk Lore Festival. She is on the
advisory council of the association, she
is Australian representative of the Coun-
try Dance Society of Scotland, and the
founder and director of the Sydney
Scottish Country Dance Club.
Behind the Folk Lore Festival, which
will bring a wealth of national costume
and customs to the Town Hall on the
fifth and the seventh of August, is a belief
in the minds of the promoters that a
knowledge of folk lore will be a factor
in world peace. Certainly when countries
begin to know the traditions, the joys and
sorrows of their neighbors expressed in
dance and music and poem, they begin to
know that apart from geographical boun-
daries the human heart and brain beat
and feel much the same everywhere.
Anyway, if you aren’t bothered much
with the thoughtful side of the festival
you will love the color and the animation
of it. This will be a “Round the World”
flight of song and dance. The costumes
are true to the last inch of ribbon, to the
last frill of lace. Clement Hosking, new
president of the Association, who knows
more about folk lore than any other man
in Sydney (he’s a Bard of the Gorsedd),
is one of the designers of the gay pat-
tern. Secretary of the Association Mrs.
Edith Murray has learned in the twink-
ling of an eye to cast her thoughts from
Greece to Wales, from Yorkshire to
Holland, from Ireland to Czecho-
slovakia, from Poland to the Hebrides.
It’s all going to be great fun and it is in
the cause of Legacy. The Duchess of
Gloucester will attend.
The Australian-American women’s
group has found a new lunching place.
It is in the assembly-room of the
G.U.1.0.0.F. Last Friday the usual mid-
day fare was served to a vast multitude
of women and one or two men. Baritone
Todd Duncan was the guest, and he gave
a most stirring address. President Florence
Taylor was easy and natural in her in-
troduction, and Aileen Fitz Patrick re-
turned thanks. Secretary Mrs. Ted
Scorfield was both attractive and effi-
cient. Her hat was one of those new, off-
the-face styles. Mr. Duncan told to his
fellow-guests the story of the small girl
at his concert the previous night. She
sat on the stage, her little legs not nearly
touching the floor. Throughout the pro-
gramme she sat with her parents still as
a mouse, and very erect—-“like a little
queen,” Mr. Duncan said. After the last
group of songs the singer went across,
lifted her small hand and kissed it. The
whole thing was so spontaneous that this
writer, who saw it, and all the audience
clapped applause.
America’s Consul - General Earle
Russell and his wife were the guests
of honor. Aubrey Halloran was the
master of ceremonies, and the party
in the Lyceum Club was still an-
other of that evergreen Josef Kretsch-
mann Society. The room was packed
with members, who listened with rapt ear
to the reading of Omar Khayyam by Ross
Buchanan, and later the singing of Liza
Lehmann’s music to the poem. Mrs.
Arthur Scrivener, who spends much of
her time in the Blue Mountains, was in
town to be one of the hostesses. The
Macnicol lady was an interested listener,
but even she, in the front row and all,
was not able, as the poet sings, to “turn
down an empty glass.” Glasses were
out, full or empty. Coffee-cups were the
only currency.
Last week his Eminence Cardinal Gil-
roy received 160 bright-faced debs, at the
Catholic Ball. It was capacity house at
the Trocadero, and the little ceremony
was so well rehearsed that it took little
more than half an hour for the girls to
bow and kiss the Cardinal’s ring. Mrs.
J. C. Crowe presented the debutantes.
The profits of the ball will go to a
church charity.
Twice last week the Tuis put on a good
show. They did a programme of Maori
song and dance at the Overseas Club, and
on Wednesday night they charmed a
crowded ballroom at the Enzed Services
Club with their entertainment. Their
flax piu-pius (skirts to you) rustled, their
bare feet stamped, and their wrists and
hands wove the graceful motions of the
Poi dance. They sang, too, the sweet,
rather plaintive notes that accompanied
their actions. In addition they had the
music of pianist Pat Gharlegros to give
atmosphere. Their “Canoe” song was a
vivid piece of miming. There was a
haka, too, and the finale was, of course,'
the “Maori Farewell,” in which all the
company added their tenors, basses, con-
traltos and sopranos. The leader of this
group is Mrs. Ziele, and Mrs. Fethney is
the manager. Lynette Levisohn, Audrey
and Betty Fitz Simon and Ellen Ferris are
others of this group. Last week’s party at
the Enzed Services Club aided the spastic
centre for crippled children.
Anybody who gets a letter from Hugh
McCrae treasures it. His~screeds flower
here and there with sketches, sometimes
black and white, sometimes delicately
colored. Even the writing on the
envelope has charm. One that floated
down from Hugh’s possie on Olympus
last week brought news of Lady Stone-
haven, who had just sent him her port-
rait in a gold frame, with a quotation
from his “Columbine”: “So all the birds
have flown. Of what more use am I?”
This was in reference to the marriage of
her youngest daughter, who recently be-
came the wife of Colonel Keith. Lady
Stonehaven is leaving Rickarton House
and will make her home for some time in
a flat in London.
There was almost an air of U.N.O.
about the Maurice Gulsons’ dinner-table
at Prince’s last Thursday night. Included
in the 10 or 12 guests were Mr. and Mrs.
Gwok Sun, of Shanghai, their daughter,
Mrs. Choy, who is on her way back to
America, and Mrs. Gulson’s sister, Mrs.
Alouche, who is departing for England
by way of Egypt. Son Lennard helped
mother and father to entertain.
The second big yabba-yabba on the
Australian Woman’s Charter will com-
mence on August 4 and end on August 11.
Last Friday the rooms of the United
Associations were buzzing with industry
as secretaries whacked their typewriters
into frenzy getting out typescript about
the aims of the Charter and highlights of
the life-story of overseas delegates. These
include Miss Kapilla Khandvala. This
lady holds the job of deputy-director of
education in the province of Bombay.
Kapilla has spent a bit in boat fares. She
has travelled in Europe, Russia included,
Tokyo, China, and has studied and taught
in U.S.A. Then there are Miss Hwang
Yen from China, Mrs. Mithan Jamshed
Lam, Catherine Beers of the University
of California. At 68 Lena Stern is taking
the voyage from Moscow, where she is
Director of the Physiological Institute.
Last Friday no decision had been made
about who would open the conference,
Dame Constance D’Arcy being unable to
do so.
Count your telegrams, count them one
by one is an up-to-date theatre axiom.
Max Oldaker, now in Melbourne playing
Rudi in Ivor Novello’s musical play
“The Dancing Years,” got exactly 100
on the opening night of the show. On
the second night Ivor Novello had boxes
of flowers sent to producer Leontine
Sagan, to Max (who takes the part
originally played by Ivor Novello him-
self), to Viola Wilson, Elizabeth Gaye
and Borovansky and members of his
ballet.

Formed in Melbourne 73 years ago, this
one of Australia’s five big mutual-life
offices writes ordinary, industrial and acci-
dent and sickness contracts throughout
the Commonwealth, Maoriland, United
Kingdom and South Africa. Outstanding
features of the latest accounts are the
record amount of new business put on
the books and a lift in the rate of bonuses
paid to policyholders—there are no share-
holders.
Total amount of new business written
was £18,573,974 (up £4,482,011), of which
£15,359,081 (up £4,134,749) was ordinary
and £3,214,893 (up £337,262) industrial.
In the ordinary department the average
per policy was at the high level of £lOOB,
as against £770 for the previous year.
The growth of group assurance has been
a big factor in swelling the figures. It is
a line that the co. pioneered, and has be-
come popular among commercial organi-
sations as a means of providing staff
pensions, and costs less to secure and
handle than would a similar number of
isolated contracts. There are also other
sound reasons why expansion should be
the order of the dry. One is the rise in
prices, which calls for a larger volume
of assurance from all classes. There is
no substitute for the protection afforded
to the individual by a contract with a
sound life office.
The forcing down of interest rates dur-
ing the war resulted in an all-round
lowering of the scale of bonuses paid to
policyholders. To help soften the blow
and protect the co.’s bonus-paying
capacity, the management has accumu-
lated substantial reserves to support and
assist the assurance funds. This will
enable liabilities under policies to be ulti-
mately calculated on the assumption that
the future rate of interest earned on in-
vestments will be not more than p.c.
net. To date the co. has assumed that the
rate would be 3 p.c. net. Last term the
net rate of interest realised (after deduct-
ing taxation) on the mean assurance funds
of the three departments combined was
£3 16s. Id. p.c., compared with £3 17s. lid.
for the previous year and £4 3s. 9d. p.c.
in 1940.
Surpluses available for distribution (ex-
cess of assurance funds over liabilities
under policies) compare as follows:
1940. 1943. 1944. 1945.

Total 1,004,418 1,187,824 1,352,709 1,238,852
Growth in the figures up to 1944 was
due partly to amounts carried forward
on behalf of members of the U.K. branch.
Last term the contraction in the overall
surplus was £113,857. In the ordinary
branch the amount distributed was
£804,299 (up £41,964), which includes
£240,000 for U.K. members in respect of
1943 and 1944. Actually the majority of
members will receive increases in bonuses
ranging up to 33 p.c. of the amounts de-
clared during each of the war years.
Bonus rates, however, are still well below
pre-war levels, which aren’t likely to be
reached again for some time at any rate.
Gross income from all sources for
1945 was £7,202,763 (up £656,828), of
which £5,624,328 (up £550,869) was from
premiums and £1,578,435 (up £105,959)
from interest, etc. After paying all legiti-
mate claims and exes., and sending
£llO,OOO to contingency reserves (now
£1,000,000), £4212 to the guarantee fund
(£24,806), £33,000 to the staff fund and
writing £30,592 off the book value of
premises, etc., £3,042,802 was added to
the life and accident funds, raising them
to £39,116,313. The mortality experience
was well within expectation, despite the
strain on war account —during the war
claims as a direct result of hostilities
totalled £BOO,OOO. Leaving taxes out of
the reckoning, exes, took 13.3 p.c. of
premium income in the ordinary branch
as againsf 13.4 p.c. in 1944. In the indus-
trial section the ratios were 28.8 p.c. and
28 p.c. respectively.
Since war began all available funds
have been channelled into the Treasury on
terms increasingly favorable to the Gov-
ernment. At end December last public
securities, etc. (up £3,442,491), amounted
to 63.6 p.c. of total assets as against 48.4
p.c. five years earlier:
1944. p.c. 1945. p.c.

and debentures £22,859,179 60.0 £26,301,670 63.6

In future more attention is likely to be
given to home-purchase business, which
should give a slightly better net return
than is to be had from Government
securities at the moment, as well as being
very helpful in the writing of new busi-
ness. Were it not for the inequitable in-
cidence of Federal land tax, “the Society
would construct a large number of
homes.,. .and would finance their sale as
completed,” the chairman says.

There isn’t the profit in shipping that
there used to be. Pre-war the co. operated
in a free market, and the length of its
manifests was governed largely by
seasonal conditions, which affected the
volume of farm and dairy produce
shipped to city markets and the quantity
of supplies backloaded for storekeepers
and others. During the war the fleet
passed to Government control, the co.
acting as managing agent. Charter fees
were insufficient to cover increased costs
of maintenance and repairs (which have
more than doubled since 1939), plus de- •
preciation on the pre-war scale, and still
leave the old margin of profit.
Only by scaling down the allowance
for depreciation—£l6,ooo (down £800)
last term as against £33,389 in 1938—has
it been possible to meet increased taxa-
tion and other costs and pay a model ate
but reduced rate of div. Over the last
half-dozen years shareholders have aver-
aged 7.6 p.c., and the payments have in-
volved a net reduction of £25,970 in re-
serves. Average net profit for the six
years to the close of last accounts was
£28,819, or 6.4 p.c. on capital. For the
half dozen years before that the average
was £40,579, equal to 9.1 p.c. on capital.
Last term the figure was £27,015, or only
£393 more than the 6 p.c. div. called for.
Ships of the fleet which had been re-
quisitioned by the Navy have been returned
to the co., and have been put back on the
old runs again. Still, a different set of
circumstances is at hand from that which
prevailed pre-war. Costs have rocketed,
owing to lifts in wage-rates and prices
for fuel and stores. And the Federal Gov-
ernment has announced its intention of
continuing control of coastal freight
charges and passenger fees, and of reserv-
ing the coastal trade for Australian-built
ships, which will not be licensed after
they are 25 years old. What profit the co.
will be allowed to earn will depend partly
upon Government policy, and partly upon
the effects of Communist-fanned indus-
trial trouble on the waterfront and among
the seamen and miners.
All that can be said definitely is that
the co. is well equipped, financially and
otherwise, to earn whatever profits are to
be had from the trade. Here are balance-
sheet figures:—

Though the co. emerged from the un-
settled conditions which followed initia-
tion of voluntary liquidation into what,
under war-time difficulties, was a satis-
factory phase of productive activity, the
board experienced some heavy weather.
At the annual roll-up in London on July
4, 1945, a resolution for adoption of the
report and accounts for 1944 was rejected,
and the second and third items on the
agenda—declaration of a final div. of
12y p.c., less tax, and election of a
director—were not proceeded with. Dis-
sension centred mainly in - the elec-
tion of a director. After some stormy
meetings and a poll, the matter was re-
solved in October last, when Col. N.
Shand Kydd (managing-director of Shand
Kydd, London, wallpaper manufacturers,
and a relative of Boulder’s chairman of
a year ago, Alfred Sim), who was sup-
ported by Claude de Bernales, was elected
in place of the retiring director, J. C.
Gardner (a partner in Chalmers, Wade
and Co., accountants). At the same time
payment of the 12£ p.c. was passed, and
the dividend warrants sent out.
Meanwhile, R. Ellerton Binns (min-
ing engineer and director of Wiluna Gold
Corp.) was elected chairman in place of
Alfred Sim (chairman of Colombia Rail-
ways and Navigation and Anglo-Brazilian
Stores). Here is the constitution of the
old and new boards:
Old Board. New Board.
Alfred Sim R. E. Binns
(Chairman). (Chairman).
R. E. Binns. A. M. Coulson.
A. M. Coulson. W. Grundt:.
J. C. Gardner. Col. N. Shand Kydd.

Then, to avoid the expense of trial of a
heavy action which had dragged for some
time, the co. paid *£25,000 to plaintiffs
(Apley Estates and Miss Ackernly) in full
settlement of their claims against the co.
With litigation out of the way and the
trouble on the board resolved, the direc-
tors are now in a position to give their
undivided attention to stepping up ore
production and to development of the
co.’s property on the Westralian Golden
Mile.
Increased production lifted gross re-
ceipts for 1945 to £619,067 (up £57,498).
Including £30,245 written off for develop-
ment, £20,024 for depreciation of plant,
etc., and £41,000 reserved for taxation,
exes, amounted to £597,051 (up £61,239).
But taxation recoveries, etc. (£28,000 as
against £9OOO in 1944), sent the net
amount available for shareholders to
£50,016 (up £15,219), or 20 p.c. on the
£250,000 of capital. Three divs. of \l\
p.c. each, less tax, were paid, making
37£ p.c. ( = £48,437) for the year. Aver-
age distribution for the last three years
was 25 p.c. p.a., and better need not be
looked for over the next two or three
years, the board says. That is because
special expenditure of £BO,OOO has been
planned—£so,ooo to bring the 35,000-ton-
a-month treatment plant to pre-war
standard of efficiency, and £30,000 to
deepen the Edwards shaft and cover
special development.
Treatment figures over the last two
years compare as follows :
Working
Ore Assay costs,
treated, value. Yield, Recovery, per ton.

1944 . . 274,720 5.16 65,833 92.8 S 3 7.59
1945 .. 306,212 5.05 71,563 92.6 34 4.94
Last year’s rise in working costs and the
small drop in grade and recovery more
than offset the benefit from treatment of
11£ p.c, more ore. In 1944 there were
‘ two stoppages at the mine extending over
a total period of six weeks. Since war
began there has been an increase of 34.7
p.c. in the cost of electric power and of
68.4 p.c. in the cost of firewood.
At end 1945 ore reserves were figured
at 2,392,426 short tons, averaging 5.3dwt.,
of which 409,423 tons, averaging sdwt.,
was classed as probable. The year’s over-
all shrinkages in quantity and value were
16,075 tons and O.ldwt. respectively.
Deepening of the Edwards shaft from
2650 ft. to 3100 ft. is “expected to open
up a large tonnage” of new pay-ore, and
a lot of lateral development has yet to
be done on several lodes above the
2650 ft. horizon. Preliminary work at the
3100 ft. level has shown that the lodes
persist in strength, but so far values have
been low. However, it is too early yet
to say whether the fall in values here is a
permanent feature.
When the books closed the co. was
holding £76,666 in cash and bullion, and
£BO,OOO in tax reserve certificates. The
amount coming to sundry creditors, plus
final and unclaimed divs., was £55,691.

Wellington Alluvials (paid capital
£250,000 in 2s. shares), floated in 1936
with the blessing of 8.H.P., records a loss
of £1074 for the year to end April last, re-
ducing the p. and 1. credit to £38,382.
That was after allowing for office exes.
(£404) and for depreciation (£3433) at
the rate of 4 p.c. p.a. during the 11 weeks
the electrically-driven 3,000,000 c.y. p.a.
dredge was in operation. Owing to war-
time shortage of labor the dredge shut
down on Dec. 5, 1942, and didn’t start
up again till Feb. 8, 1946. Operating
results from the start compare as follows:

Up till the time the dredge stopped re-
coveries averaged 1.91 gr. per c.y., worth
9.16 d. a yard, of which working costs
(excluding p. and J. items) took 5.5 d.,
leaving a working surplus of 3.66 d. a
yard. Comparable figures for the 11
weeks from Feb. 8 last to the close of
accounts were 1.65 gr., 8.12 d., 6.99 d. and
1.13 d. respectively. For a short period
after resumption the yardage dug and
gold recovered were both low, owing to
inexperienced labor. The tractor and bull-
dozer impressed by the Government in
1943 are to be replaced. The co. has paid
two divs., 4d. and 3d. per share respec-
tively in 1941 and 1942. Original esti-
mates were that there was about
60,000,000 c.y. of payable wash available
with gold at £8 an ounce. The co. will
need to make a much better showing to
justify the current market price of ss. a
share. For the 11 weeks to end April the
dredge appears to have been in lower-
than-average ground, and costs, which
had been got back to 4.96 d. a yard in
1941, were approximately 7d. a yard.
With everything dearer than pre-war,
costs promise to be a tough nut for the
management to crack.

west of Stanthorpe (Q.), have failed to
reveal the presence of radio-active sub-
stances. Professor Kerr Grant, Uni-
versity of Adelaide, says that long ex-
posures—over three weeks —under a
photographic test gave extremely faint
indications of radio-activity, from which
it could be inferred that radium content
was less than 0.05 p.c. Other samples
sent to England were declared not
uranium ore and not of the slightest in-
terest as a source of uranium. It is in-
teresting to note that Dr. C. F. Davidson,
official geologist of the British Directorate
of Atomic Energy, says “it is generally
agreed by experts in the analysis of radio-
active ore that for this class of metal
spectrographic analysis does not give
satisfactory results and is definitely less
sensitive than two other techniques that
can very readily be employed—fluores-
cence and a radio-metric method.”

From London; Younger men with ex-
perience are in demand for seats on the
boards of Westralian goldmining cos.
domiciled here, but it is difficult to find
them. Most of the present directors of
these concerns are old, some very old,
men. One is 92, another died the other
day at 88, and some others are 80 or over.
There is a vacancy on the Lake View
board, caused by the death of Cordner
James, and if a suitable young man can
be found his chances of appointment are
considered bright. Two of the present
Lake View directors are nominees of New
Consolidated Gold Fields of South
Africa, Ltd., a big shareholder.

A. H. Telfer, Under Secretary of Mines
(W.A.), estimates the value of gold re-
ceived at the Perth mint and exported in
1945 at £A5,010,541, or 84 per cent, of
the value of all minerals won in the State
during that year. Dividends paid by Wes-
tralian goldmining cos. in 1945 totalled
£458,479, a decrease of £356,236 com-
pared with 1944. Of other minerals pro-
duced in the West in 1945, coal realised
£572,896, pyrites £102,053, asbestos
£44,641, arsenic £41,771, .alunite £23,902,
silver £22,757 and tungsten £8946.

SUNDRY SHOWS
AT THE TALKIES.
Hollywood films are rarely better
than when they are about America or
Americans, a point well made in “They
Were Expendable,” at Sydney Capitol.
The film was written, directed and, in
parts, acted by ex-U.S. Navy men and, if
it weren’t for the smooth, professional
quality of the acting, plus an occasional
touch of heroics, it would almost pass
for' a newsreel account of its subject—
the story of the squadron of U.S. Navy
P.T. boats which fought it out to their
last boat with the Japs in the Philippines.
The documentary nature of the film calls
for several crises and peaks of action,
disallowing the usual skilful dramatic
construction of director John Ford, but
there’s an almost uncanny realism about
most of it and the tumult of battle scenes
is splendidly recorded. Robert Mont-
gomery and John Wayne play the main
roles with quiet subservience to the narra-
tive.
English film producers seem to depict
Americans more accurately than Hollyr
wood portrays the British—although it’s
not unlikely that American audiences
hold the opposite view. Anyway, the
American types in “The Way to the
Stars” (Sydney Embassy) seem a deal
more natural than some of the British
characters dished up in Hollywood ver-
sions of war-time Britain. The film is a
war-time romance of a British airfield
and the characters thereabouts. Michael
Redgrave is the flight-lieutenant who goes
in over France, leaving a wife (Rosamund
John) and child ; John Mills is the flying-
officer convinced by Redgrave’s fate that
aircrew types shouldn’t marry; Renee
Asherson the popsy who can’t follow his
reasoning; and Douglass Montgomery
the American pilot who comes to the air-
field when the Americans take over.
There’s a pleasant mixture of comedy and
sentiment and a complete absence of
heroics.
The American producers «are not so
comfortable with the British characters
and British story of “The Green Years”
(Sydney Liberty), It follows the usual
A. J. Cronin pattern of oppressed
childhood —a Catholic Irish orphan
comes from Dublin to his Scottish
Presbyterian grandparents and endures
the usual Cronin brand of persecu-
tion and hardship before he achieves his
ambition to study medicine. His chief ally
is his great-grandfather, a drunken old
braggart played with reckless abandon
by Charles Coburn. Possibly Hollywood
could handle this kind of thing better if
they switched it completely to American
characters and an American setting—
Hollywood sentimentalism and a dour
Scottish scene blend as effectively as ham-
burger and haggis.
Hume Cronyn, who gives a capable
performance as the grandfather and
assistant sanitary inspector in “The Green
Years,” turns in a much better stretch
of acting as the lawyer in “The Postman
Always Rings Twice” (Sydney St. James).
He is the one credible character in the
film —Cecil Kellaway as the roadhouse
proprietor who is murdered by his wife,
Lana Turner, and the hobo, John Gar-
field, have all been polished and disin-
fected to make a sentimental romance
of the story of a crude and vicious crime
and the penalty for it.
Possibly because they’re more honest
in intention and performance, murder
mysteries are maintaining a better
standard than most films. In “The Dark
Corner” (Sydney Mayfair), Clifton Webb,
owner of an art gallery and a beautiful
wife, discovers that the lady is dallying
with a young lawyer; he hires a thug to
dispose of his rival and pins the crime
on a private detective, one-time partner of
the legal man. The sleuth is kept very
busy extricating himself.
The action of “The Spiral Stair-
case” (Sydney Plaza) takes place in
one night in an oppressive old man-
sion ruled over by a bed-ridden
matriarch (Ethel Barrymore) and occu-
pied by her two washed-out sons and a
clutch of servants. On previous evidence,
the murderer is apparently obsessed with
the idea of removing anyone suffering
from any kind of deformity, and his next
obvious victim is the dumb attendant to
the old lady. The dumb girl is played
most expressively by Dorothy McGuire,
who uses the restriction of silence at
every opportunity to emphasise her help-
lessness and terror.
In “Miss Susie Slagle’s” (Sydney Vic-
tory), Miss Susie (Lillian Gish) is a
fragile and over-sweetened spinster who
runs a boarding-house for medical stu-
dents. The film depicts the aspirations and
behavior of half a dozen of them for four
years, at the end of which time most of
them achieve their ambitions, medical
and romantic. There’s a similar note of
sentimental melodrama in “My Reputa-
tion” (Sydney Taller), in which Barbara
Stanwyck, a widow with two sons, finds
that her recent bereavement doesn’t pre-
vent her from falling heavily for an
army major (George Brent). As an
actress, Miss Stanwyck can whip froth
on to almost any syrup, but she is flat out
to hold this piece together \yhile the
major changes his mind and complete
reconciliations are effected all round.
Charles Laughton is equally extended
to carry the load of “Captain Kidd”
(Sydney Empire); he has his moments of
greatness but scuttles himself before be-
ing sunk by the Gilsullivan doings of the
piece. Sydney Lyceum has “Renegades”
—technicolor derring-do in the wild west
with outlaws brought to heel by an honest
young medico who wields scalpels and
six-guns with equal facility.
Melbourne Concerts.
No break is evident in Melbourne’s
musical weather and audiences are grow-
ing larger. This was conspicuously the
case with Schramm, the Polish pianist,
who, coming unheralded and minus the
auspices of the A.B.C. or other estab-
lished entrepreneurs of music, played to
small houses until music-lovers got to
hear about him and packed his final con-
cert.
Another outstanding event, musically
speaking, was the Austrian Chamber
Concert sponsored by Friends of Demo-
cratic Austria. Nobody cares much now-
adays as to whether Mozart, Haydn and
Schubert were democrats or Calathum-
pians, but they certainly could write
music. A feature of the performance
was the exquisite clarinet playing of Tim
White in the Mozart quintet for strings
and clarinet, and in Schubert’s “Shep-
herd” with contralto Winifred Gardner
and pianist Peter Langer.
English conductor Eugene Goossens put
the Symphony Orchestra through its paces
at the Town Hall in a brilliant exposition
of Strauss’s “Merry Pranks of Till Eugen-
spiegel” and followed this musical jest
with a broad and deep rendering of the
First Symphony of Sibelius. William
Herbert, the Melbourne tenor, sang ex-
cerpts from Haydn and Mozart.
One-acters at Killara.
In balancing the glittering but shallow
nonsense of Noel Coward’s “Hands
Across the Sea” with Barrie’s “The Old
Lady Shows Her Medals,” at Killara, the
Kuring-gai Theatre Guild showed nice
judgment. Too much of Coward at his
frothiest is apt to pall, and Barrie, charm-
ing as he sometimes is, is apt to make the
average mortal squirm at his patches of
sheer sentimentality. But, taken together,
they are not so bad. And the inclusion
of a workmanlike comedy by the Aus-
tralian Lionel Shave gave the evening’s
entertainment the required symmetry.
Taken all round, the acting was good,
and full justice was given the plays, which
will be showing again tonight at Killara
Hall. Isabel Monaghan was outstanding,
within the rather sugary limitations of the
role, as the Old Lady, and Joan Watson
Smith was impressive as the maid k
“That’s Murder.”
Sculpture in Sydney.
Australia is well represented in most
branches of creative art, but in sculpture
we have little. Therefore there was a
special interest in the exhibition by three
sculptors, Daphne Mayo, Arthur Fleisch-
mann and Lyndon Dadswell, at David
Jones’s Gallery, Sydney.
At first glance the contribution is disap-
pointing. Daphne Mayo has a large
bronze female, “Suzanna,” conventionally
treated, and, without being actually mis-
shapen, stiff and ungainly ; Dadswell has
some rather grotesque figures, and
Fleischmann, although he has nothing
typically Australian, has some small and
charming terracottas of Balinese subjects.
But, although both Daphne Mayo and
Dadswell have uneven collections, there
is a vitality about some of their work
which is distinctly promising. Daphne
Mayo, obviously, is interested in charac-
ter. This is plain in portrait heads of
“John Young, Esq.,” and “Dr. J. V.
Duhig” in bronze, and her striking terra-
cotta, “An Allied Serviceman,” which is
a strong study of a negroid type. Her
weakness, as has been seen, is in larger
subjects. But in “Bronze Girl” she seems
to have harmonised character with
beauty.
Dadswell’s work is exceedingly uneven,
as though he is yet groping for technique.
An Australian touch is present in his
strongly impressionistic “Abo,” a head in
bronze. And his “Man and Horse” is,
with limitations, impressive. Here the
struggle for expression is more obvious,
and has taken the form of deliberate dis-
tortion. Despite its obvious faults, the
figure has vitality. The horse’s head is
raised, as though neighing, and, seen from
a certain angle, it seems about to leap
forward. Which, combined with its
blocky strength and the slouching pos-
ture of the rider, at once relaxed and
alert, makes its total statement consider-
able.
The eighth annual exhibition of the
Australian Academy of Art at the
Athenaeum, Melbourne, looks as if it had
been hastily rushed together. Of the two
or three portraits in it, none is distin-
guished, some of the pictures are marked
“unfinished,” and some aren’t catalogued
at all. In “Against the Light” John Farmer
has a sensitive still-life, Alan Moores
“Afternoon, Frankston,” has some quality
about it, W. G. Grant sends a lively
sketch from Queensland and E R. Jones
shows a clever study m The Sale Room.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
As in the Grand National Steeple, Tente
found his weight a shade too much for him in
the well-endowed A. V. Hiskens Steeple over
2 miles 31 furlongs at Moonee Valley on Satur-
day. He made a great race of it, but just failed
to overhaul another game old fencer. Victory
March, with Jocularity putting in a very prom-
ising-looking finish to get third. Tente (11.10)
was giving the winner a stone and third horse
a bit over 2st. It looked good form on the
part of all three of them for the Australian
Steeple on Saturday week. The Hiskens carries
a fourth prize of £lOO, which went to Gold
Watch, one of the South Australian contingent.
Scratching of Solvent and Gyrone prevented
the Brunswick Hurdle from being a similar
guide to next Saturday’s Australian Hurdle. It
went to the much-improved five-year-old Gay
Lothario gelding Red Alder, half a length to the
hot favorite First Aid, with Llandrillo third.
Red Alder had shown a glimpse of form when
beaten by David Star at his previous start,
but' went out at 25 to 1, Victory March com-
pleting at twenties a disastrous double for
punters. If Red Alder is saddled up for the
Australian Hurdle he must have a chance with
bottom weight, but there seems doubt about the
Brunswick Hurdle form. Quite a number fell
by the way, and the field altogether looked on
the weak side, particularly as First Aid has
consistently failed since coming over from S.A.
Solvent has had a fair rise in the weights,
and is also reported doubtful for the big Hurdle.
If he goes to the post on Saturday he will
naturally take a lot of beating, but there doesn’t
want to be anything wrong with the best of
them on the Australian Hurdle course. A
pick from the field before acceptances: Hiatus,
1; Solvent, 2; Gyrone, 3.
Hiatus and Tente were this page’s picks for
the Nationals double; both ran second, and
both could make amends in the coming big
double. They are solid and consistent battlers
over the jumps, which cannot be said for a
good many of the others.
As well as the battering they took in the
two jumping events, punters had a torrid time
generally at the Valley. There was fairly solid
support for the Valiant Chief colt Glenfern,
winner of the six-furlongs Derrimut Handicap
first division, but it was mild to the backing of
A. Breasley’s mount Delina, beaten for second
money by the outsider Edward John. Proving
himself one of the most brilliant sprinters of
the winter racing, Glenfern had set up an un-
beatable lead at the turn, and was going easily
over three lengths in front at the finish. He is
an ex-picnic performer.
The only other well-supported winner was
the Kinderscout gelding Despatch Rider in the
mile Cooee Handicap for two-year-olds, but
there was solid backing also for the equal favor-
ite Rossfield (second) and for Tulaki (third).
The backing of Tulaki could be taken as a
pointer; the Tudor King filly came down from
twenties to 5 to 1.
The rest of the bill was unrelieved disaster.
The jumper Boondale (33 to 1) downed the
hot favorite Skyway and Contact in the 12-
furlongs Glen Orla Handicap; country per-
former Burnevoke (50 to 1) beat even-money
favorite Reperio, with Sir Change third, in
the Derrimut second division; and Spanish
Legend (at twelves) completed the rout by get-
ting there narrowly from Night Fighter and
Space in the Sunset Welter, with solidly-
backed Medicine, Gayness, William Tell and
Three Wheeler among the others. It was an
extra-good run by Night Fighter.
* * * •
A. Breasley finished the Melbourne season
with a run of outs, but was still, for the third
time in succession, a very easy winner as jeading
jockey—s 2 firsts and a dead-heat, with H.
Badger’s 29 firsts the next best. F. W. Hoy-
sted, with 21, trained the greatest number of
winners, though three others —T. Lewis, E. J.
Willmott and L. Robertson, in that' order —led
him in stakemoney won.

In Sydney the 1945-46 racing season con-
cluded with an S.T.C. meeting at Rosehill, and
here punters were given a chance to get a bit
square, a well-fancied runner winning almost
every race. Unlike last season, there was no
close finish to the jockeys’ premiership, Mulley
having an unbeatable lead a couple of weeks
before the final meeting. Cook was again
runner-up (42 wins against Mulley’s 57), with
Thompson, who won it last year, next.
With Sajakeda, who hadn’t raced in months,
the best of only five opponents to Civic Pride
in the Flying, the disappointing Ajax filly was
given an ideal opportunity of winning a race.
She and Sajakeda started equal favorites at
5 to 4. The filly won, but her supporters
wouldn’t care to have the experience over again.
As usual, she took up the running from the
start, the question being only of her ability to
see out the seven furlongs, and the reply nega-
tive seemed likely when Sajakeda tackled her
near the distance and drew ahead. Then, sur-
prisingly in view of some of her displays in the
past, Civic Pride came again and superior racing
condition prevailed; Chatlock was third.
Course scratching of the dual acceptors Mar-
lume and Farm Hand reduced the S.T.C. Han-
dicap field likewise to six starters and gave
Royal Peer a chance of improving on recent
minor placings. He started favorite and never
looked in doubt, taking the lead a furlong from
home and going on to hold off Sir Neith, with
Gallant Law a distant third.
For the Two-year-old Handicap there was
little in the betting between Man At Arms,
Clipper and Double Mint, quoted at about fours
and 9 to 2. In the running Rafferty tactics
were highly popular; Double Mint, under a
steadier of 9.1, was unable to make up the
ground lost in a series of scrimmages. Clipper,
carrying a featherweight 7.11, finished strongly
from a long way back to account for the grey
Denali and Man At Arms, the latter a full
brother to Nobleman by the Derby winner
Rivoli.
Despite having his fair share of weight and
being drawn wide out at the seven-furlongs bar-
rier, Young Veilmond (G. Moore) was marked
a good thing for the Three- and Four-year-old
Handicap and duly justified his 7-fo-4 favoritism.
Never behind more than three horses, he took
charge confidently when Moore let hini go m
the straight and won comfortably from Yankee
Lad and Pearl Trader. Young Veilmond is a
three-year-old colt by Veilmond from Little
Mutt, dam of the speedy Trimmer.
Ridden again by Thompson in the 10-furlongs
Trial, the Kuvera gelding Thrums added another
good win to his recent successes. His backers
obtained 7 to 2, a good price owing to the
presence of Johnny Zero, who. flattered with
6-to-4 favoritism, finished ahead of only three
others. Komadil and Adept were m the minor
money. . . . •
Torment (A. Ward), who carries the dark
blue silks of A.J.C.. chairman A. G. Potter
scored a popular win in the Fixed Weight
Maiden race. By Genetout from the im-
"If I'd had big spurs , boss , he might've run SECON D-lasi!"
ported Rossolis, Torment has shown promise
at hils few outings and shared favoritism with
New Cashmere and War Loan. New Cashmere
was closest at the finish, followed by San-
cherie. ....
The last race on the card, a nine-furlongs
Welter, brought the bookies some relief, being
won by Cisco, rather neglected in the betting
at sevens despite a record of consistency.
Neither Etching nor Marshal Tito, who filled
the places, was much fancied.

They certainly try to have ’em run straight
round Hollywood. By what’s called the Post
Observation Method an observer chosen by lot
watches each horse in every race from the
minute he walks on to the track for the post
parade till he is led away after unsaddling.
These observers talk into a mike that is slung
under their necks and their remarks on every-
thing that happens to their horse goes on to
records for the enlightenment of the stewards
and officials. As well, they have Telefilm
Control, by which a movie is taken of every
part of every race, and can then be run over
either normally or in slow motion. The idea
has spread to New York, where they now film
them front-on, side-on and rear-on, the films
being ready to run through for the benefit of
officials in about seven minutes.

V.F.L. football form is about as easy
to follow as a frog over stony country
on a wet night. Nobody would have ex-
pected St. Kilda to beat Footscray, but
it did and ’Scray lost its top place in
the “four,” leaving Essendon up there
alone. Last Saturday the Dons were
swamped in a torrent of Melbourne
points, 9.24 to 10.13, Footscray made
hacks of the tough South Melbourne
team, 12.12-4.7, and Geelong astonished
itself and everybody else by beating
Fitzroy, 9.9-5.7. The other three games
went according to Hoyle—Collingwood
beat North Melbourne, 17.19-9.16,
Carlton beat Hawthorn, 15.18-10.11, and
Richmond beat St. Kilda, 16.16-9.9.

In inter-State Australian Rules matches
on Saturday, a Queensland team beat
N.S.W. by 19.27 to 21.11 at Brisbane, and
against S.A. in Adelaide Vic. ran away
in the last quarter to win by 16.21 to
11.14.
“Sturt”: Club football in Adelaide
adjourned, for the return match against
Victoria, with Norwood 22 points on the
season —only one match lost, and that to
Port Adelaide—Port next with 16, with
West Adelaide, Sturt and West Torrens
tying at present with 14. Norwood and
Port are old friends as well as rivals;
when they meet both flags are flown over
the pavilion, and the secretary of the
losers afterwards hauls theirs down.

N.S.W, v. Queensland was a hard
fought but unspectacular R.U. game, the
deadly tackling of the Northerners’ backs
giving the N.S.W. flyers little room to
move. The Queenslanders led 8-6 at half-
time, and at that stage looked as if they
might last long enough to win. In the
second half, however, they failed to
register a point, and their tackling relaxed
sufficiently to enable the N.S.W. hacks to
pour through and run up another 14
points: N.S.W. 20, Queensland 8. In an
earlier game N.S.W. II overwhelmed
Southern States 57-23, winger Stone scor-
ing four tries for the winners.
“P. McM.”: The inside backs for the
N.Z. tour are proving a quandary for the
Australian Rugby Union selectors. On
Saturday, clubmates Cawsey and Cremm
failed to set the N.S.W.
moving snappily and against fast breaking
All Black forwards they would have been
frequently caught in possession. Burke
and Bannon are being given a trial in the
Australia v. The Rest game. Burke is
snappy and elusive though somewhat
light, but Bannon will have to improve his
handling and positional play to beat
Cremin for the pivot position. The only
other halves of possible international
standard are Boland (Parramatta), Camp-
bell (St. George) and Schulte (Queens-
land).
M.C.C. v. India second Test:
Manchester’s weather upset the India v. Eng-
land Test, and with the worst of the conditions
India did well to make a draw. In ideal con-
ditions on the first day England hit' up 236 tor
four wickets; from then on it was a struggle
through the rain. England’s six other wickets
fell for 58; India floundered for 170; England
“declared” at 153 for five wickets; and India
hung on long enough to make 152 for nine
wickets.
Compton, who blurred his consistent county
scores with a “duck” in the first Test, redeemed
with 51 and 71 not out; Washbrook got 52 and
26, Hutton 67 and 2, and Hammond 69 and 8.
In the match Bedscr took 11 for 93, Pol-
lard, of Lancashire, 7 for 87, and Voce 1
for 46. With 11 for 145 on the hard wicket
in the first Test' at Lord’s, Bedser’s wet-wicket
performance labels him a fine all-weather
trundler.

Bromwich, Quist, Pails, Brown, Sidwell
and Brodie have been selected by the
L.T.A.A. to form a Davis Cup practice
squad. It is not a final selection of “pos-
sibles” ; others can play their way in—
or out. The choice of Bromwich, Quist,
Pails and Brown was to be taken for
granted, though Quist, who is the oldest
of them at 33, has not yet reproduced
his pre-war form and Pails (25) dis-
appointed in his overseas tour. Bromwich
(27) holds the Australian title, and Brown
(22), with his fine efforts at Wimbledon,
has shown that he has the right spirit for
international play. Sidwell (26) was Aus-
tralian junior champion in 1939 and repre-
sented N.S.W. in inter-State matches.
Recently he won the Victorian hardcourts
title in good style. Lionel Brodie (29) is
ranked No. 7 in Australia, beat Brown
and Crawford in inter-State matches last
season, and was runner-up to Sidwell in
the hardcourt championship.

Combining boxing with business once
more. Hockey Bennell outpointed George
Elliott at Leichhardt. Allowed to get
away with holding and hitting in every
round, Elliott was on his feet at the end
of the 12th, but had been a badly beaten
pug rounds before. Yet the decision for
Bennell was hooted!
With every advantage over his oppo-
nent except a fighting heart, Les Sloan
failed against a Melbourne welterweight,
Sel Hamilton, at the Sydney Stadium.
Sloan’s superiority in boxing stood out
early, but when the Victorian kept attack-
ing, despite stiff punishment, the heavier
man went into a smother. It proved of
little avail against Hamilton’s left leads,
which brought a copious flow of blood
frojn Sloan’s mouth. In the 12th and last
round Sloan took the offensive, but his
rights nearly all missed, and there was
no argument against the decision for
Hamilton.

Investments, Taxes and Industry
The Treasury has relaxed its controls
over new capital issues by industrial and
business enterprises since the end of the
war. Small issues of up to £lO,OOO a year
may now be made without Treasury con-
sent, while larger flotations permitted in
1946 include Bitumen and Oil Refineries
(£750,000 Australian, £500,000 overseas),
Bruck Mills (£550,000 Australian,
£170,000 overseas), Burlington Mills
(£350,000), Bradford Cotton (£370,945),
Conpres Printing (£600,000), McPherson’s
(£483,714, including premium), William
Adams (£105,000), and Gordon Edgell
(£149,500, including premium). In addi-
tion, Felt and Textiles in the later half
of 1945 put out £1,000,000 of 4 p.c. de-
benture money and Australian Paper
Manufacturers £2,250,000 of 3| p.c.
stock.
A decided change has thus come over
the industrial and investment outlook
since the end of the war. These new
issues indicate that industry in many of
its branches is planning new peace-time
enterprises, while also showing that even
the Canberra Labor Government sees the
necessity for allowing private industry to
take up the responsibility of giving more
employment and expanding essential pro-
duction. It is a pity that the Government
does not further assist in gaining these
objectives by a more helpful taxation
policy and a contraction of its socialistic
experimentalism and costly vote-buying.
Last year the Commonwealth Govern-
ment levied a record £327 million in taxa-
tion, compared with about £76 million
in 1938-39 (income-tax levy then only
£l2 million, compared with £lB2 million
last year). It claimed to have spent £5lO
million, but that figure was calculated
after deducting credits that in no way
represented an offset to the year’s spend-
ing. The true expenditure figure was
nearer £6OO million, which represents
about half the total national income.
Australian industry and taxpayers will be
the better for it when more people re-
gain the privilege of being allowed to
spend or invest the greater part of their
own income. Present huge Government
spending (and taxation) is an obstacle to
recovery in productive capacity and liv-
ing standards. The spending competes
with private industry for labor, materials,
etc., and the taxes dull incentive.
Company taxes remain at their highest
war-time rates. There is a flat-rate tax
of 6s. in the £ on the net income of all
companies, with a super-tax of Is. in the
£ on profits in excess of £5OOO earned by
public companies—mutual-life offices and
co-operatives excepted. Public cos. pay
2s. in the £ on undistributed profits, while
private cos., on undistributed profits, pay
at the rate applicable to their individual
shareholders as though all profits were
distributed in dividends. Public cos, also
pay war-time (company) tax on all profits
above 5 p.c. on capital employed. The
">&> ji«* “> P- c - * h f n m ° re
P c - » ra F ned on . em P 1 J?°
concern is required to pay o
tlme (company) tax and super-tax _
Mr. Dedman, speaking in Mr. Chifley s
absence, told taxpayers’ representatives
this year that he held out little hope of a
rebate of tax paid by companies being
allowed when profits are passed on to
shareholders by way of dividend. Prior
to the war a rebate was allowed share-
holders up to the company rate, thp
offsetting, to some extent, the double-
taxation of dividend income.
Net profits of over 500 companies, as
recorded by the Commonwealth Bank,
have shown a decline from an average of
6.8 p.c. on shareholders’ funds in 1939
to 5.9 p.c. in 1945. Allowing for the
depreciation in the value of money (for
example, the basic wage has been lifted
23 p.c. in the period), the fall in com-
pany profits over the war years has been
heavy.
Price-ceilings and price-control still
operate against industry, though serving,
on the whole, a useful purpose. Industry
can rarely recover full cost increases,
hence cases of declining profit on larger
turnover. Mr. Chifley in his financial
statement in Parliament on July 12 said
that the inflation danger had abated very
little: “Current earnings are running
high, and behind them are the unspent
balances and reserves built up during the
war and augmented in recent months by
the large disbursements of deferred pay
to servicemen. The Government will con-
tinue to use price-control as an instru-
ment for the protection of consumers and
the preservation of balance within the
economy so long as the need remains.”
But consumers, including industry, are
given very little protection against strik-
ing coalminers and the like who are doing
grievous damage to our whole productive
system.
Ceilings still operate in the Common-
wealth on the prices of listed shares. In
no other country are share-dealings so
restricted. Bank of N. S. Wales shares,
selling at £39 in New Zealand, are pegged
at £33 in Australia. Wilcox, Mofflin, 17s.
6d. in Maoriland, is restricted to 13s. 6d.
here. Other comparisons are: G. J. Coles,
89s. and 80s. 3d.; 8.H.P., 51s. and 465.
3d.; Woolworths, 28s. lid. and 245. 9d.;
Felt and Textiles (Aust.), 665. 6d., 475.;
Morris Hedstrom, 565., 31s. 6d, ; and
Burns Phiip, 825., 655. There are many
other similar illustrations of the under-
valuation of stocks in the Commonwealth,
while many Australian stocks not quoted
overseas are also obviously undervalued.
Iji London New Broken Hill sells at the
equivalent of 40s. 6d., against 225. 3d. in
Australia, North B.H. at 665. 6d. (595.
6d.), and Zinc Corp. at 101 s. 6d. (,925. 6d ).
The difference in both New Zealand
and London prices is the result of the
arbitrary pegging of share-price levels by
the Treasury, a practice which penalises
persons forced to sell their scrip for taxa-
tion or other reasons. It is still required
that a person buying listed shares shall
retain them for at least five months be-
fore reselling.
An Australian possessing sterling funds,
or able to acquire such funds privately,
may now buy shares in London. But
little, if any, sterling is available for this
purpose in the ordinary way. The New
Zealand Government still strictly controls
the outflow of N.Z. money, with the
result that shares on an Australian
register cannot be sold in Maoriland and
the proceeds brought to Australia. It has
been impossible for N.Z. shareholders to
take up their rights to Australian issues in
many cases.
Though still controlled by the Treasury
in a way that creates the glaring anomalies
already quoted, there has been a letting-
ou ‘ P nces , o£ ™ ny f ar “ “i't!
extent that those forced to sell now might
in some eases show a profit on their
original investment, especially where
“averaging up” Swas availed of in the
depressed days of 1940 and 1942. Where
a profit is shown it should not be subject
to taxation unless the seller is classed by
the authorities as a trader. If dividends
on the shares have been taxed at the
property rate over the past few years (as
distinct from the personal-exertion rate)
the evidence is that the shareholder is
classed as an investor, not a trader, and
casual profits on sales will not be taxable,
There is a strong demand for Austra-
lian industrial shares today based partly
on the desire of many people to change
their money into industrial equities of
real economic value, and to this extent
the rise in share-prices often represents
no more than a measure of the deprecia-
tion in the buying-power of our money,
The rise, too, has been assisted by the
artificial forcing-down of interest rates.
On the other hand, granted a sympathetic
taxation policy and a reasonable attitude
by trade-unions (based on a desire to
raise all living standards) there is un-
doubtedly a big future ahead of essential
Australian industries.

Bank-credit Debt
At long last it has been dragged out
of Mr. Chifley that only 46 p.c. of the
“public” loans (£lOO6 million) raised dur-
ing Federal Labor’s term of office was
contributed by persons, firms and com-
panics. The 46 p.c. would include contri-
butions from life-assurance and other
insurance concerns, leaving 54 p.c., or
£543 million, as the subscription of banks
and Government funds, but particularly
the savings banks.
This makes nonsense of Mr. Dedman's
claim that Australia used only £47 a head
in bank credit up to 1944, compared with
Canada’s £72 and Britain’s £67. Mr.
Dedman quoted a figure of £155 a head
for the United States. Actually, during
1942-45 banks of all kinds in the United
States subscribed for only 45 p.c. of the
total interest-bearing debt created by the
Government—a figure which, in the
United States, is nevertheless considered
to be inflationary.
. r u -r, „ ■ j- . +l ,_ + Uo«irc onri
, M . r ‘ Chifley in f . ,
the like have taken .s4 pc. of the loans
taised m Ausri
office in 1941. To be strictly comparable
with the United States the Australian
floating debt has to be included; on
May 3l this stood at £360 million, all
taken by the banks. Including this we
find'that nearly 66 p.c. of the fncrease in
the public debt during Labor’s term of
office was taken by banks, and that the
otot- of £123 a head-it was closer to
to £47. As is «/ ua l with Labor-party
financial
tentions are patent misrepresentations.
Taking the peculiarities of our exchange
rate into account and the lower value
, m ° ne X * n ., Cnitcd States, it is
probable that the bank-credit debt earned
by Australians is as high as that ar
by Americans,_ while the proportion
bank-credit debt to total borrowings m
Australia s case is the highest in
English-speaking world. Canada and
Britain both have much sounder figures
ro show than either Australia or the
U-S.A.
The low number of subscribers to Aus-
tralian war loans gave the first indication
of the position that is now revealed,
The danger in the extensive use of
savings-bank deposits indirectly to
finance public loans is that the deposits
are still available for spending by the
depositor after they have been spent on
war waste by the Government. This
danger of double spending does not arise
when the depositor withdraws his money
and invests it himself, especially when he
is barred from raising an overdraft on his
bonds. Mr. Chifley is well aware of
the inflationary menace inherent in this
kind of finance ; it is what he is referring
to when he exhorts the individual to “be
a saver, not a spender.” But he has
defended the practice in the House not-
withstanding that it involved contradict-
ing himself.

Mr. Chifley, replying to Mr. Fadden,
gave some information in Parliament
concerning the numerous mixed-up
“credits” applicable to the 1945-46
Federal income and expenditure figures.
The Prime Minister said gross war expen-
diture for the year was £452 million, while
“credits” totalled £74 million, as follows: ,
Disposals, £15.6 million; repayments of
advances to trust accounts, £l6 million;
repayments by the British Government on
supplies and services later admitted as
lend-lease, £l2 million; supplies and ser-
vices for forces of other Governments m
Australia, £7 million; and miscellaneous
credits and repayments arising from war
expenditure, £23 million.
Deducting all these “credits” from “war”
spending, the net “war” figure for
1945-46 becomes £378 million, which is
the amount the Government likes the
people to think it spent on “War” last
year. But few of the credits appear to be
truly applicable to last year, so that
“war” spending was much higher than
the net total. Mr. Chifley said that re-
coverable expenditure during 1945-46 on
behalf of other Administrations was
£46.6 million, of which £43 million was
recovered, leaving a net debit of £3.6
million. In the Budget estimates (Sept.
7, 1945) it was reckoned that £8 million
would be spent on behalf of the British
Government and other Administrations,
while £2B million would be recovered,
leaving a net credit of £2O million.
Nearly £39 million more has been spent
this way than was originally expected,
and only £l5 million more was recovered ;
assuming that there was £2O million net
due to us at the beginning of the year,
more than £2O million is now owing. But
Mr. Chifley says we owe Britain £2O
million, apart from £8 million due to the
United States under the lend-lease settle-
ment. There is no good reason why the
£2O million credit alleged to be due to
us on July 1, 1945, should have been a
mistake in bookkeeping. If Mr. Chifley
really knows what the position is he
should explain it without further delay.
Government bookkeeping methods are
undoubtedly peculiar, but they shouldn’t
be that peculiar.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
showed a profit of £540,920 for the year
to March 31, and the lot has been passed
into Consolidated Revenue. The board
reports that the present comparatively
high level of net overseas funds is be-
cause of the difficulty of getting needed
imports, unsatisfied orders for which have
been piling up. Sterling holdings increased
by £17.5 million to £65.6 million during
the year. The curbing of inflationary
price tendencies to some extent depends
on adequate imports coming forward.
The board comments that an important
consideration, becoming more widely
recognised, is that wise monetary
measures make their best contribution to
increased living standards and economic
security only if they are allied to an ex-
panding production of goods and ser-
vices, the enjoyment of which is the real
test of prosperity,
* * * *
The textile industry in Australia faces
a period of great expansion provided
adequate labor is available to attend to
spindles and looms. There is a world
shortage of textiles just now —woollen,
cotton, silk, rayon and nylon—and before
the war all Australian textile mills except
woollen were taxed to capacity. Now
even the woollen mills cannot cope with
demand, but the leeway here is likely to
be made up more by additions to labor
forces than by extension of plant. The
cotton industry, however, still sees room
ahead for considerable general expansion,
especially on the calico and shirtings side,
and rayon-weaving is now making its
first really big appearance. Burlington
Mills is already turning out cloth at
Rutherford (N.S.W.) woven from im-
ported yarn, and Bruck Mills has taken
over a former munitions factory at Wan-
garatta (Vic.), where rayon will be woven,
dyed and printed. Burlington has U.S.
affiliations, Bruck has Canadian. Each
concern has an issued capital of about
£700,000. Courtaulds, the world’s lead-
ing rayon-yarn producer, is considering
setting-up an Australian factory, but
double-taxation and industrial problems
are holding back final plans. This ven-
ture would involve an outlay of millions.
The re-clothing of servicemen and the
lag in the clothing position generally have
put Australian worsted-makers in a very
strong position for the time being. New
Zealand has been receiving a portion of
our production, and we could even sell
to America, but the Australian market is
so undersupplied that the export trade
has aroused some political opposition.
Unless an export trade can be build up—
and maintained —it is doubtful if our
Woollen and worsted mills can hope to
maintain full production in years to come
°n local demand alone. Our plant capa-
city is greatest on the woollen side,
worsteds not being so extensively pro-
duced, though in peace-time subject to
British competition.
In its shipping branch last year the
Commonwealth Government showed a
debit of £3.7 million, compared with £2.2
million in the preceding year. What
credits, if any, are to be offset against
these debits the accounts do not reveal.

Government members “answering”
Opposition criticism of the Wheat Indus-
try Stabilisation Bill made much of what
the Liberal and Country parties hadn’t
done for wheat in pre-war years. There
is an essential difference between pre-war
conditions and those now prevailing.
Before the war “stabilisation” involved
subsidising the industry, whereas today
the Labor Government’s proposal is
purely one of taking money away from
the wheatgrower, with only a speculator’s
chance of his getting his - own back. Apart
from present “stabilisation” plans, the
wheatfarmer, like the miner and the
woolgrower, has been letting the Aus-
tralian consumer have wheat at under the
cost of production, this being a conces-
sion to price-control.

The war ended with Great Britain’s
internal debt standing at £22,500 million
sterling, compared with £7,284 million
in June, 1939. The war just about
trebled the burden. The United States
Federal debt grew from $45,895 million
to $262,566 million in the same period—
a multiplication of nearly six times. The
debt has since risen to just short of
$280,000 million,' The U.S. floating debt
is now more than one and a half times
the total pre-war Federal debt. But there
are chances that the United States will be
operating on a balanced national Budget
much sooner than either Britain or Aus-
tralia. That, at least, was the position
before strikes reached their worst pitch
and before the break in price-control.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Lub”: Mick was boasting of his
crackerjack sheepdog, which kept its dis-
tance from the other assorted mongs and
had eyes only for the jumbucks and Mick’s
signals. Old Robbie watched the pro-
ceedings approvingly. “Y’ haven’t had
him long,” he observed. “No,” Mick
replied. “I got him orf Mrs. Tingale. Y’
wouldn’t know her. She’s had a pretty
bad spin lately, with her husband clearin’
out with the flash piece from the pub,
leavin’ her an’ three kids t’ battle f’r
themselves. Darkie useter be his dawg,
an’ I slung her a tenner f’r him. Pretty
crook Harry treatin’ her like that. He
must be an out-an’-outer.” “Yair,”
agreed Robbie thoughtfully. “He’d be a
low-principled sort o’ bloke t’ leave that
champeen dawg behind.”

“Betcha”; When he wants to get over
a fence, a fox mostly prefers to climb
cat-like on to a post and down the other
side. Met one that took a netting-and-
barb fence in his stride. The dogs had put'
him up on the flat some distance away,
but after a few repetitions of the old trick
of diving into a patch of fern, waiting till
the dogs had made the other side, then
doubling out where he had entered,
Johnny gained enough headway to make
the fence. Over he went with inches to
spare, and without pause set an angle
course up the fence. With the dogs over
and closing in once more, he altered his
course and again cleared the fence, gaining
precious seconds while his heavy pursuers
got over. Five times he made use of the
fence in his dash for the safety of a
scrub belt that was over half a mile
easy running from his starting point. Just
another instance of fox brains against
canine speed.

“X.E.D.”: Finding bee-trees comes
easy to an expert, and I’m one who
doesn’t mind passing on the secret. Tools
required are a small balloon and a two-
foot length of cotton. Lassoo a bee with
the cotton, tie the balloon on the other
end and relea'se quickly. The bee im-
mediately heads for home and it’s quite
an easy task to follow the course of the
balloon in tow. Should, however, a
severe tail-wind be blowing at the time,
the flight may be lost and the bee, on
entering the hive, will become enraged
at the balloon jamming in the doorway
and retaliate sharply. It should be no
difficult task for a bushman to locate the
spot from the indicative blast of the
balloon.

“Fang”: Tommy Rogan lives alone in
a shack near a string of lagoons, and I
hadn’t seen him for years till I called the
other day. There was a large notice board
on his gate proclaiming:
NoTis To AnGlers

TreSpaSSers ConFiscaTed
All Fish ProseCuted
“What’s come over you, Tommy?” I
asked doubtfully. “Anyway, there never
was a fin or a scale lifted from any of
those lagoons. Tryin’ t’ keep visitors
away?” “No fear,” grinned Tommy. “It
got sort d’ lonely here on me own. Y’d
hardly believe the number of visitors I git
since I painted that sign. Scarcely a day
goes by without someone callin’ t’ explain
me error or laugh about the notice. And
in summer mobs of campers an’ sports
drop in to ask about the likely holes f’r
fishin’, an’ more’n likely they bring some-
thin’ t’ try me bottle-opener on. They
never get any fish, o’ course, but they
seem t’ enjoy themselves. An’ I git all
the company I need.”

“Salmon Gums”; I’ll support “Dicky
Beach’s” statement that whale meat as
food goes back “a thousand years 01;
more” (B. 26/6/’46), but it wasn’t con-
fined to the northern hemisphere. I once
saw a whale washed up on a compara-
tively remote part of W.A.’s sou’-west
coast. Though it stank already it was
disposed of by blacks, who ate their way
through it till the bones lay clean-picked
on the beach. Now those abos.’ ancestors
had for far more than a thousand years
w'atched the annual northerly migration
of whales with a lively interest, and it’s
safe to bet that any beached whale was
made the occasion and means of such a
feast.

“Gravelsnateher”: The birds of the air,

ish carousals in small cleared patches on
moonlight nights. But I was unprepared
for the evidence that awaited me one
morning after a number of rabbit traps,
laid with an ingenuity bred of several
unsuccessful attempts, had accomplished
their purpose. There, awaiting merciful
dispatch—they were chloroformed with a
hammer—were a vixen and a massive
Persiah tomcat. The cat was easily iden-
tified by its owner, from whom it had
absconded after being caught red-handed
in his chicken run, and the vixen was
suspected of being the mate of a fox
caught some months previously. I’m pre-
pared to believe that, both bereft, the
one of a home and the other of a mate,
they joined forces and pooled what be-
came an almost unbeatable accumulation
of cunning and intelligence. But I’d like
to know, what must for ever remain a
mystery, how far their friendship had
developed and whether they were any-
thing more to each other than mere
partners in crime.

“Sarina”; As the grassfire burned
along the spear-blady grass ridges, I
noticed that no butcherbird, magpie
or jackass was on hand to pounce on the
insect and reptilian fodder that was flee-
ing before the flames. Then I saw the
reason: hawks of all sizes came dropping
out of the saplings in twos and threes.
Yet strangely enough wood swallows in
hundreds wheeled and dipped above the
flames, and congregated in groups on the
trees right under the murderous beaks of
the red-brown buccaneers. I therefore
crave enlightenment: are wood swallows
and hawks habitual friends or are the
former too stupid to keep away from
birds of prey?

“Edjudina”: Perhaps they breed pros-
pectors tougher nowadays but my ex-
perience of men perishing from thirst
differed from that of “S.G.’s” engine-
driver (B. 26/6/’46). Here is actually
what happens to the perishing one.
Eight hours without water in the
broiling heat of the desert and a
man’s mouth is so dry that he is beyond
even spitting chips. Soon his tongue be-
gins to swell, protruding until it lolls
down over his chin, so that actually it
becomes sun-scorched. Intense stomach
pains have started long before this ; then
the stomach begins to swell. Soon
delirium supervenes and the victim starts
to shed his clothes. Thus sunburn is
added to the other agonies. Finally
comes the illusion of cool, clear water,
and, flinging himself down, the poor
devil drinks, filling his mouth with the
burning sand. As to the way back —
well, my policeman started by dripping
water on the swollen tongue by squeez-
ing a wet rag. He finished by feeding
tepid water with a spoon.

“Timothy Tywire”: Stephenson viewed
a possible train-cow collision as “awkward
for the cow.” Near Gladstone (Q.), re-
cently, a collision betweeq a rail motor-
tricycle and a wallaby proved awkward
for all concerned. The marsupial was
killed instantly, the “trike” was smashed,
it capsized, and two of the three men
aboard were injured. No blame for the
occurrence is attachable to the present
high price of ’roo skins.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: “Dash-me-Buttons” Brown,
a stranger to most of us, set up a camp
a couple of miles down the river and
began* to cut and cart to a woodpile for
steamers. A mousey little bloke, he never
said much, leaving the talking to his large
and sturdy missus. She ran the camp and
reared their three kids, what time “Dash-
me-Buttons” hurled his Bst. 101 b. at the
timber and juggled the logs on to his
wagon and from that to the woodpile.
He toiled from dawn to dark and would
have toiled on Sundays but that his
missus objected. Some of us thought
privately that it might have been fairer
if she’d taken the axe and left the little
man to run the house. One Saturday after-
noon, when we were idling about on the
back verandah, Bill peered down the river
and said, “Somebody headin’ this way
in a boat.” About a half-mile down the
reach, pulling towards us against a four-
knot current, was what appeared to be
“Dash-me-Buttons,” and we lazily started
betting on how long he’d take to reach us
and why he wasn’t working. As he drew
closer we saw him lose his oars and
lean forward on the thwart; and the boat
begin to drift. Bill and I raced down to
our own boat and went after him. The
bottom of his boat was awash with blood,
there was a great gash down his shin into
his foot and he was barely conscious. We
got him tied up and revived, and while
Bill got out the car to run him into the
doctor I asked what happened. “Was
tryin’ for that bit o’ timber just this side
o’ me camp,” he confessed. “Went up in
the boat t’ do a day’s cuttin’ an' cut me
ruddy leg.” “Yairs,” I said, “but why
didn’t y’ make home, instead o’ tryin’ t’
pull a mile and a half up here?” He
looked abashed. “Aw, didn’t want t’
scare the missus an’ kids,” he mumbled.
* * * *
“C.E.”: The new rider was an admirer
of wild life, and when the dogs put up
a young ’roo he bellowed himself hoarse
in a vain effort to call them off. “Gripes,
they’ll kill the thing,” he yelled, and
digging in a heel raced his nag after the
chase. A series of plunges down the
steep slope, a hidden wombat hole, and
the nag crushed awkwardly, landing his
rider headlong into a patch of nettles.
The animal-lover rubbed half a dozen
places and was surveying his lamed nag
when the barking broke out with renewed
vigor “They got him stuck up,” old
Ted called encouragingly; and, grab-
bing a waddy, the would-be rescuer
limped off to the melee. “You blood-
thirsty devils,” came his voice, as he
whanged right and left. “Killing a poor
helpless creature that hasn’t done you
any harm! Go on, get!” Belting off
the dogs, he turned to the half-grown
’roo that was flat out alongside, and
tried to up-end it. The ’roo struggled,
caught sight of the newchum, and let
out with both feet. It was some yards to
the creek, but our naturalist made it
in record time, dropping the last 10 feet
on to the thin ice of a large pool. Wild
life? Gripes, our wild fauna had nothing
on that new specimen when he eventually
crawled out.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: We hit the
Fitzroy River at Yeeda Crossing in time
to see a huge crocodile calmly swimming
up-stream against the floodwaters. The
cobber hadn’t seen a croc, before, so he
rushed off down to the river to get a
close-up. In doing so he took off over
a six-foot bank of sand to reach the
water’s edge, and when in mid-air he let
out the most awful, piercing, blood-
curdling scream I’ve heard. It was as
well he did, for two saurians snoring on
the sands below and on which he was
going to crashland made off like greased
lightning, even more scared than my
petrified mate.
• * * *
“Colonial Cove”; Perusing some his-
tory of early Botany Bay, I learned that
officials interested in the meagre flocks
and herds brought out in the First Fleet
were dismayed on observing that the
progeny of these animals showed an in-
ordinately large proportion of males. For
years the same tendency was noted,
though when it came to the improvement
of sheep flocks and valuable rams were
imported, this tendency to breed an over-
proportion of males was welcomed. Do
imported stock still show the same ten-
dency, or have the hormones now become
blase on the mere matter of moving to
the Antipodes?
* * * *
“Dick Tafone”; Queensland is under-
going the most erratic and destructive
> winter in its whole history, particularly
in southern and south-western areas. The
May-June rainfall—49 points in Brisbane
—was the lowest ever recorded. Frosts
in June —17 in Brisbane and more in some
outlying districts —have put up another
all-time record, and have done extensive
damage to sugar-cane and small crops
over many hundreds of square miles. A
dry spell of 51 consecutive days' is the
second-longest on record. In the southern
high country the heaviest falls of snow
for 46 years have caused serious losses
of crops and stock, and the south and
central west are undergoing one of the
worst droughts that they have ever ex-
perienced. When Brisbane’s coldest day
for three years was followed, just one
week later, by the hottest July day since
1898 public opinion became confirmed in
the idea that them weather blokes must
either be goin’ dotty or out on strike.
* * * *
“Zake”; Ants have long been held up
to humanity as models of intelligence and
industry. Industrious they may be, but
intelligent—well, who hasn’t seen a big
meat-ants’ nest built fair in the middle
of a country dirt road? They slave away
to build their subterranean city, and
every time a lorry, car, buggy or trap
traverses their roof-top the ants, gnash-
ing their teeth, rush out, shake their
antennae furiously at the sacrilegious
humans and set about carting their
mangled brethren to decent burial before
starting to patch up the wrecked
thoroughfares and build a new town hall
in which to hold indignation meetings.
And they just about get half-way through
that job when another Neddy comes
along and planks a hoof flush on the
ancestral home ; then the beefeaters, livid
with rage, tear out again looking for
stoush. Although this will go on for
year after year, those meat-ants will never
stir up the grey matter sufficiently to
shift over near the roadside fence where
they won’t be disturbed.

“Propalong”: “Vets!” snorted Danny.
“The ol’ bush stuff was better ’n all this
scientific gyvo. If y’d come t’ me instead
I coulda, fixed y’r horse with soap an’

even dror money from a busted bank
account. Remember one time I had a
little roan mare. Biddy gets rubbin’ round
a fence’r somethin’ an’ cuts a helluva gash
on her rump, just on the top o’ the tail-
When it swells up an’ festers I mixes up
a good oT dose’r soap an’ sugar with a

THE GAP.
Oh, there were nights around The Gap when
lighted campfires glowed
And reached like lines of city lights far back
along the road:
And, groomed and armed, the troopers rode
from barracks in the town
To guard the loads of precious gold the mining
fields sent down.
And on their way to Bendigo the slow teams,
laden full,
Were rested at The Gap before they faced the
uphill pull;
The drivers, as the shining tyres a while from
turning ceased.
Regaled themselves at shanties there that
“welcomed man and beast.”
And in the rough-built shanty bars o’er-hung
by old-world signs
They watched the diggers pay for drinks with
nuggets from the mines;
And some from distant northern fields a fortune
with them bore
And spent or lost it in The Gap, then started
back for more.
The stage-coach thundered through The Gap,
the lights flashed on ahead,
And crowds around the shanty doors stood
cheering as it sped,
And up the Bald Hill watched it go and dip
behind the crest,
To change the team three miles away, down at
the Diggers’ Rest.
On camping grounds where tents were pitched
and resting teams were fed,
Untrodden now by heavy feet the thorns and
thistles spread;
The grim old hills above The Gap sleep on in
smoky haze,
And undisturbed the timid sjieep come down
the slopes to graze.
VICTORIA.
DOUBLEGEE.


“Bo”: When his shack was burnt down
in a bushfire, “Gundy” Grahame, an old
bachelor who eked out an uncertain live-
lihood with a few scrub cows and a hand-
ful of dubious sheep on a block that was
mostly blackberry and bracken, set about
building a new one himself, independently
declining help that had been offered
promptly by his neighbors. As a tem-
porary home he pitched an ancient tent
he’d had from his fossicking days and
then from the stunted scrub on his pro-
perty he started hewing his new residence.
It was about five months later that he
drove the last nail in and stood back to
admire his handiwork. As he did so his
uplifted gaze fastened on an object, then
he swore and rushed inside for his gun.
A few seconds later there came a rending
crash. It was Roberts, his riverside
neighbor, who, hearing the noise, rushed
over and extricated “Gundy,” practically
unhurt but swearing luridly, from the
ruins of his new “house.” Roberts asked
what had happened. “Gundy” looked up
at the sky and shook a gnarled fist.
“The adjectival swine! ” he quavered. “A
man’d expect a wagtail, a butcher-bird
or even a coupler maggies to git on his
roof, but who’d ’a’ thought o’ makin’
allowance fer a blasted pelican lobbin’
on it!”
* * * *
“Goldie”; We were sloping a block
with a small vein of quartz pretty enough
to decorate a jeweller’s window. The
ground was big and flawed. One lump
of about 10 tons was resting gingerly
against the reef, and it was holding back
enough rock to keep a quarry going for
some time. The mate and I were awake
to rhe danger, but couldn’t resist gadding
out a few more specimens. Came a light,
warning creek ; then an explosive cr-a-
aclc I Dunno who passed who up the
ladder, but we both got out with marks
of hobnail boots on our faces. Though
that was a year or two back the slope
hasn’t caved in yet, nor has anyone been
down for the tools we left.
"What's the good of her bein' able to yodel if she can't milk?"
“Mat’s Mate”: We’d landed a job pull-
ing out the canes behind the pruner on a
big Mildura vineyard and the boss gave
us a two-roomed hut alongside his house
for a camp. We took our meals in his
kitchen and pretty soon Mat began to get
tit-bits on his plate that weren’t on mine.
We made no comment, but he kept a
wary eye on the daughter of the boss
and took care never to be alone within
her sight. Then, in the lunch-hour and
at other odd times when we rested and
smoked on the hut verandah, she took to
appearing in shirt and shorts and banging
a tennis ball up against the blank brick
wall of the house which faced us. It was
remarkable the number of times she mis-
hit that ball so that it bounded our way,
necessitating her coming for it or one or
other of us picking it up for her. Mat be-
came silent and thoughtful.
Presently we began to have
her company in idle moments,
while she talked about tennis
and sought our opinions about
building a court. Mat de-
veloped gloom. A couple of
mornings later he suddenly
regained hi s cheerfulness,
asked the boss for an hour or
two off for “important busi-
ness” and hiked it into the
town. That evening he even
sought the lass out for a yarn,
a performance which sat me
back on my heels and made
me dashed curious. But he
only grinned maddeningly and
went happily to bed. Next
morning, as I struggled to
keep up with him as he joy-
fully threw canes about, the girl
came to us and, with a singular expres-
sion on her face, said, “There’s a tele-
phone message. It’s to say that the police
know where you are and won’t worry as
long as you keep out of trouble.” We
finished the job in peace.

“B. 4”: Here is a variant of “Horse-
less Horseman’s” yarn (B. 3/7/’46)
anent the origin of fire. An island Adam
and Eve desirous of preserving the gift
of fire whilst battling with sharks as they
swam to the mainland, bound a lighted
brand to Toby’s tail, enjoining him to
keep it alight. Toby played his part vali-
antly, holding the torch aloft even though
the fire worked down and sizzled some of
his rudder. Landing safe, Toby lay
near the blaze, hoping that the missing
portion of his caudal furniture would
turn up. His progeny have inherited and
continued the habit ever since. That is
their reward for their ancestor’s fortitude
when bereft of his wagger.

Will Lawson: Before the railways
came two small vessels, the Natone,
driven by side-paddles, and the President,
a screw steamer, ran from Brisbane to
Southport with passengers. Among the
cargo fleet was the Maid of Sker (B.
17/7/’46), then a stern-wheeler, which
made her home port in Nerang Creek,
near Southport. I’ve seen her going out
over the Nerang bar between the southern
end of Stradbroke Island and the main-
land, in rough weather, a sight which
stuck in my boyish memory for years ; in
fact, I wrote about her in some verses.
Two Rivermen, which ended like this:
She staggered when she felt the bar
And quivering rolled again,
Stern-lifting with her cranks ajar
And screaming with the strain '
That was taken from seeing the old Maid
years before. She staggered right enough.
How she ever got over the bar with a
stern-wheel was miraculous, for half the
time the wheel was in the air, as she
lifted over the rollers. On such voyages
her destination was Tweed Heads.
Natone and President were owned by
rival firms and fought fiercely for the
trade by making fast passages. In day-
light they used the Boat Passage, turning
off near Lytton, which cut off miles. But
at night, even when moonlight, this was
risky. I’ve seed the skipper of the Natone
right on the iron canopy of the high
bridge, shouting orders to the helms-
man. When they passed Deep Water
Point we used to swim out and dive deep
as they passed to hear the thunder of
paddles or screw. The Natone won fame
in ’93 by being washed into the Botanical
Gardens by the flood, along with the
gunboat Paluma and the liner Eurimbla.
A contract was to be signed to have them
hauled back into the river. But a
“’ Any's always dropping 'is Haitches."
second flood happened overnight and all
of them floated involuntarily into the
river, the Natone to be swept down to
New Farm, where she sank.

“Lub”: Andy, putting up a fence on
Perkins’s hill paddock, struck rock-bot-
tom while sinking postholes. Perkins
supplied gelignite, fuse and detonators
and a drill to jump the holes in. “How
much fuse do I need f’r each charge?”
Andy asked, after the process of loading
the holes was explained to him. “About
18 inches should be safe,” Perkins said.
Andy was tack, bleeding, covered with
dust and with torn clothes, soon after the
roar of the first shot had reverberated
over the flats. “It’s no good t’ me,” he
told Perkins indignantly. “I got 10 holes
bored, charged the first one an’ lit it, an’
was sittin’ down loadin’ the next when the
first went orf nearly in me face. Git
someone else t’ fire them other nine or I
walk orf the job!”
* * * ♦
“Lower Tops’l”: Windjammers making
Australia were usually compelled to sail
from west to east (B. 10/7/’46) because of
prevailing winds, and in the latter days of
sail this was instanced by the voyage
of the Invemeill from Melbourne to
Bunbury (W.A.) in 1919. The little 1470-
ton British barque cleared Port Phillip in
ballast; striking a hard succession of
westerly gales she was forced to the east-
ward and later put in to Sydney. On her
next attempt, when within 1200 miles of
her destination, the westerlies came in
harder than ever, so her skipper put the
vessel before the wind and decided to
make Bunbury by “running his eastings
down” via the Horn and the Cape of
Good Hope. Cap’n Shippen estimated it
would take 95 days—the Invemeill,
which was eventually hulked in 1926, was
built to carry and not to sail —but it took
only 76, averaging 192 miles a day with
a best day’s run of 266. Occasionally,
however, sailers made Australia west
about, around Cape Horn. The first
Yankee whalers came that way, and if
A. S. Allison’s poem refers to the maiden
voyage of the barque Archibald Russell
he’s right. This fine four-master —as one of
the Erikson fleet she’s due in Australia
this season —first left the Clyde in ballast
and came out “west about” to Iquique in
101 days, after which she loaded nitrates
for Sydney, arriving there in December,
1905.

“E. 2”; We used a long, springy sapling
as a bridge over the creek, and though
at times it got a bit slippery with frost
we managed tolerably well without a
handrail. The big yellow dog crossed at
a couple of bounds. Over-excited one
morning, he got tangled up with Charlie’s
heels and they took the dive together to
the deep, icy pool 10 feet below. After
that the dog, whingeing and unhappy,
made a blind rush to get across each
time and fell in consistently. His loss of
confidence was nearly as bad as that of
Charlie, who hoofed it a mile further
each day to cross by the traffic bridge
downstream.

“D.R.H.”: A couple of times a week
the missus performs a miracle. She takes
a bowl of flour, a spoonful of salt, some
tepid water and, from a bottle, hop-
water and boiled spud, and presently there
are appetising golden-brown loaves on the
kitchen table. The stuff in the bottle
makes the miracle possible. The potato-
and-hop soup is merely tucker for a few
million microscopic plants. When it’s
“working” nicely the tiniest drop of the
liquid, smeared on a glass slide, shows
thousands of oval cells, many or most of
.them budding into new cells. But the
yeast cells, although plants, are very dif-
ferent from those lords of all creation
the green plants. Having no chlorophyll
they depend for their tucker on food
manufactured by the verdant vegetables,
and this the missus provides for them in
the form of boiled spud, which is mostly
starch, which, in turn, is the most con-
venient food storehouse the plants have
devised. A minor ferment in the yeast
bottle turns the starch back to the plant
sugar it originally came from and the
yeast cells reach for their knives and forks.
But yeast can’t “breathe” oxygen, as do
most other plants and animals, to burn
the energy content from the sugar. In-
stead, it makes the energy concealed in
one part of each glucose molecule get to
work and release the energy from the rest.
This is a rather clumsy way of feeding
and some of the tucker gets spilled. In
other words, there is some chemical
waste: the yeast gets some food from
each molecule, but lets some escape to
form a liquid, alcohol, and a gas, carbon
dioxide. When the missus kneads the
yeast into the flour the cells go on work-
ing and the resultant gas “raises” the
sponge.

“N. Sylvester”; That the dingo is a true
dog and not a minor sort of wolf was
early shown by his capacity for inter-
breeding with the European dog gone
bush ; for, despite all the romance of
fiction writers, dog and wolf will not
interbreed. Not so much because of
any natural bar but because the in-
herent animosity between the two canine
tribes is too intense even to be recon-
ciled by the instinct towards mating.
But the odd thing about the wild dog,
which may be only quarter dingo, is that
he never seems to acquire the faculty
of barking, that vocal lack being one of
the main characteristics of the true
dingo ; shared also by the dingo’s nearest
relative the Dhole, the wild dog of
northern India. Another characteristic
that the mongrel wild dog always seems
to inherit is the dingo jaw, that appara-
tus like a steel trap that snaps and pulls
away, bringing out a big gout of flesh and
leaving the victim to bleed to a state of
weakness that will permit of its being
pulled down.
* * * *
“Blime”: The half-grown pup disgust-
edly took in the fencing operations, till
a movement up the hill sent him investi-
gating. An enthusiastic charge and grab
put him back on his haunches, wailing
tragically and rubbing a paw over his
nose. Presently, as the noise crescendoed
to an indignant and unduly prolonged
challenge, the old dog made the trip,
glanced at the porcupine, threw a
scornful look at the pup and retired. Pup
sat down to work it out. Then, as the
porkie dug in, his challenger commenced
operations alongside, Down went porkie
and in went pup, grimly sticking to the
job of digging first on one side then the
other, and edging always nearer bis well-
armed foe. During his short spells he
turned a surprised nose downhill, as hour
after hour passed and no help offered.
About midday the porkie’s bank col-
lapsed, and in a heroic manoeuvre the
•pup turned him over on his back. Then,
with cocked-ear watchfulness and an ac-
companiment of low threats, began a
wary and thorough investigation of the
short, moving legs and mysterious head.
Followed a few contemptuous pawings,
and pup returned downhill, satisfied he
had done all a dog could do in the matter,
and if I wanted anything further the next
move was up to me.
THE FLOOD.
The sand-drift silts in the stable
And the green creeps stealthy in
Beneath the sag of the rafters
That lean towards their kin
Who lie, in fruitful burial,
Half-rotted in the sand,
Forgetful now of the axemen,
Glad to rejoin the land.
Before the flood there were men here —
The ghosts of red-armed men
Are between the stack and the chaff-chute —
But the flood has come, and again
The land lies quiet - , maternal,
Brooding drowsy-eyed
On the nudge of suckling grasses
That press against her side.
Before the flood, in the old days,
Men drove the land in chains,
And, strong with the strength ihey
plundered,
Were lords of all the plains.
Until the land, exhausted,
All gaunt and sterile lay,
And from her reddened bareness
The men were forced away.
Then came the floods and, laughing,
With every sun that shone
The land grew stronger, greener—
But the men, the men were gone.

When the older “No. 3” and “S” types and
the hotboxes of still earlier vintage were
in general use, an expert had to carry a
tool-kit weighing about a hundred-
weight to cope with repairs, and in addi-
tion the machines had to be sent to the
city for complete overhaul once a year.
As far as actual performance goes,
modem machines shear no better than
the old ones ; on tough sheep the old No.
3 puts it all over the modem machine. In
every other respect, however, the chicken-
foot handpiece represents the only out-
standing advance in shearing machinery
in the past 30 years.
For handpiece repairs, the expert can
get along comfortably with a very small
proportion of the tools he once had to
carry. A screwdriver, cog and bush key,
hammer, pliers and fulcrum post gauge
are the only necessities. With these and
the station vyce, any expert worthy of
the name should be able to keep modem
machines in perfect order.
From the owner’s point of view, cost
of upkeep is only a fraction of what it
used to be. The life of the old-time fork
seldom exceedecl one season without one
reconditioning at least, and a good supply
of new ones had to be included in the
parcel of duplicates forwarded at shear-
ing time. The chicken-foot fork, on the
other hand, will last for years. Hand-
pieces which have shorn over 30,000
sheep still carry the original fork, and
some records go even better. Some wear
will develop in the yoke sockets after a
time, but, contrary to some theories, the
ballrace wears practically not at all.
Fulcrum and tension-pin cups wear
quickest, but their life may be prolonged
in some types of machine by turning
them round to give a new seat to the ten-
sion pin or fulcrum post. Hundreds of
pounds are wasted every season through
tension pins being changed needlessly.
The ball points should show unmistakable
flattening before they are scrapped.
Sliding sleeves, or pistons, will also
stand up to years of work, but they must
be kept oiled, or, better still, have heavy
grease put into them each day. Fulcrum
posts will continue to function even
though they show a lot of wear.
More yokes are discarded through
ignorance or worse than from honest wear.
Never grind down the cutter pins and
don’t let shearers do it. Some would-be
“guns” grind down the pins to make
cutter-changing easier, but they invariably
grind off the points that fit into the small
holes in the cutter. This is liable to
cause accidents through the cutter being
thrown out of the machine.
The performance of a handpiece de-
pends more on the condition of the
backjoint or wrist-joint than on any other
part. Various types of machines have
devices to take up wear, but the back-
joint must be watched and washered-up
when it shows any wear. Neglect leads to
cogs getting out of alignment, and to other
troubles. Before they get too badly
worn, send joints back to the manufac-
turer for reconditioning. The short
spindle should also be washered to take
up any slack.
The secret of getting the best out of a
handpiece is to give it plenty of oil, lack
of which leads to undue wear and over-
heating, The shearer who is always in
trouble with his machine is invariably the
one who won’t take time to oil it pro-
perly.
It is impossible to lay down any hard
and fast directions to cover the amount
of duplicates you will require to see
shearing through. Everything depends on
“Them coal shortages must be 'ard on the city folk, Ma—no gas
or ’lectric light.”
the season —dust and sand are the chief
causes of wear—on the condition of the
sheep, and on the expert.
Most experts shy off the job of putting
new felt covers on machines. Unless lace-
on rugs are obtainable, the handpiece has
to be stripped completely before the new
cover can be slipped on. Even so, it is
not easy unless one knows how, and it
is advisable to bind the new rug tightly
with sewing twine in front of the inspec-
tion hole and behind to keep it from
slipping.
Some modem machines have done
away with the fork-stop peg and use other
devices to keep the fork from rising and
thus locking the machine. Where such
an accident does occur and the fork-stop
peg is driven out, usually stripping the
thread in the shell, you may have to send
the handpiece back to the city to have the
fork fitted with some alternative device.
This is perhaps the only job that can’t be
done on the station by any competent
expert. The rest is only a matter of re-
placing worn parts with new, and the
good expert knows just how much wear a
part can take.
Don’t clean handpieces after shearing
by blowing them out with steam. This
only rusts them and necessitates replace-
ment of all wearing parts before they can
be used. At the end of shearing or
crutching, get the expert to supply a list
of duplicates required for next shearing
and see that they are ordered in time.
The Mules Operation.
“Progress”; It is now beyond the stage
of experimentation, and as an effective
method for reducing and almost eliminat-
ing fly-strike is an outstanding success.
The operation requires the clean re-
moval of a single strip of skin from each
buttock with flagging shears. It’s important
to note that not only is the medial fold
removed, but this strip is removed from
all sheep without respect to position or
size of fold. Start an inch above and to
the side of the tail and continue to just
above the hamstring, on the last 4in, roll-
ing the shears inwards. Pull the skin
towards and upwards to the shears with
thumb and forefinger and avoid jagged
edges, leaving a clean wound cresccnt-
shaped and about 2{m. wide on a level
with the vulva. The bare area around
the vulva should not be cut, and the
width of skin left directly below the vulva
and between cuts should be approxi-
mately two fingers wide. The operation
aims at stretching the bare area and re-
moving the wrinkles and slack skin so
that the wool is drawn away from the
“mid line” and consequently from the
staining of urine.
Careful operators only should be
allowed and attention paid to sterilisation
of shears, which should be about sm.
in the blade with the points preferably
taken off and the heels, if desired. The
points are dangerous to the catcher. Keep
shears in antiseptic when not in use, and
dip them after sharpening or doing a
dirty sheep. Avoid dusty yards, and
dodge the fly period if possible, more
particularly where the small bush fly or
house fly is active. Choose satisfactory
weather with no flies. The sheep should
be allowed to draw away themselves im-
mediately after the operation into their
paddock. It is advisable to operate at
weaner stage and with not more than six
weeks’ wool on the sheep.
Use no dressing on cuts, as this acts
merely as an' irritant and retards healing.
The edges of the wound will join in three
or four days, and complete healing occurs
in about three weeks. After the first week
a white patch is visible only. Under no
consideration should sheep be disturbed
during healing. If healing does not pro-
ceed quickly the following causes may be
present; an attack of the small bush fly,
long wool clotted to wound, inflammation
due to fly-strike before operation, use
of dressing or faulty and careless cuts.
Should the owner, after three weeks,
consider he should dress for fly-strike
due to any of the foregoing causes of
backward healing, it is a good idea to
remove from the flock sheep requiring
dressing and treat with a bluestone mix-
ture about sky-blue strength.
Stimulative Bee Feeding.
“Bumble”: The apiarist with an early
honeyflow in sight should endeavor to
build up his colonies to take full advant-
age of it. Provided pollen supplies are
available, judicious feeding to stimulate
early brood-rearing will be amply repaid
later on. It often happens that a dearth
of nectar occurs simultaneously with
early spring pollen supplies, usually
copious where there are wattles; the
stores are quickly consumed and sea-
sonal development of the colonies is re-
tarded till nectar-producing plants blos-
som.
Stimulative feeding, given irrespective
of hive stores, is carried out for two or
more weeks, doses of a pound or so of
thin sugar syrup at blood heat being
placed in feeders inside the hives daily.
Once the colonies get to full working
strength they will go ahead rapidly, but
feeding should be continued if stores are
below requirements. Frame feeders are
very convenient for the purpose.
Rein Control.
“Haute Ecole”: For teaching the young
horse or correcting the hardened sinner
have two single reins each Bft. 6in. long,
one end stitched back in a loop to take
width of girth. Thread girth on near side
through loop; cross rein over withers to
off side, pass through offside curb ring on
bit, back to withers. Buckle to corres-
ponding opposite side rein. This is known
as the patent safety rein, or cross rein.
The many ways in which this acts is
almost equal to re-educating your horse.
In it the animal is no longer heavy in
hand: it will stop an inveterate puller, is
a firm check on an inclination to buck,
does away with that sudden plunge which
is usually the prologue to a bolt, and
teaches the horse to carry himself as he
should —neck arched and head placed
exactly where you want it.
Of course, this contrivance is not foi
the use of the mutton-fisted. Light
hands are required. Any suggestion of
yanking or unsympathetic pulling will
only upset the animal, which will then
begin to back, there being no other way
he can go ; and if this misuse is persisted
in, a rear will result, so that, in correct-
ing the other faults, he will have been
taught the worst fault of all.
According to Major H. Barrowcliff
pllis, an Englishman of high repute as
a horseman, bad cases of bucking can be
cured by the addition of a crupper
joined to these reins, which pass under
the saddle instead of being attached to
the girth, seeing, of course, that they
move freely.
I have successfully used the cross reins
even on a six-year-old, wise beyond his
years and experienced in dodging work.
Water for Sheep.
“Hux”: Sheep are often stubborn re-
garding the source of supply. They take
a fancy to a bore, riverhole or tank and
refuse to drink anywhere when th £
water gets low and dirty. Impure water

OFTEN BRING
Sleepless Nights
Doctors say your kidneys contain 15
miles ol tiny tubes or filters which
help to purify the blood and keep you
healthy. When they get tired and
don't work right in the daytime, many
people have disturbed nights. Fre-
quent or poor kidney action sometimes
shows there is something wrong with
your kidneys or bladder. Don't neglect
this condition and lose valuable rest-
ful sleep.
When disorder of kidney function
permits poisonous matter to remain m
your blood, it may also cause nag-
ging backache, rheumatic pains, leg
pains, loss of pep and energy, swell-
ing, puffiness under the eyes, head-
aches and dizziness.

LIFE ASSURANCE
—How does it work
for you?
What is Life Assurance?
How does it work ?
Life Assurance offers every
man and woman in good
health a plan (policy) that
enables him or her (the
policy holder) to join a large
group of people (the Life
Assurance Office) which
promises to pay a sum of
money to his family at the
time of his death, or to
him if he be alive on a future
named in the policy.
This promise is given in re-
turn for the policy holder's
promise to pay a sum of
money (the premium) regu-
larly to the Life Office.
Like any other co-operative
movement, Life Assurance is
purely voluntary. No one is
compelled to invest in it
against his or her will. Those
who become policyholders in
a Life Assurance Office are
free to arrange for just as
much security and protec-
tion as they feel they need.
Life Assurance will begin to
work for you just as soon as
you say the word.

London wool
sales to start again
in September
NEW COMMITTEE FORMED
Auction sales of wool will be resumed in the London market in September, and will
continue at regular intervals as before the war. Six firms of London Selling Wool Brokers have
formed the Committee of London Wool Brokers to handle wool consigned to the London
market for sale.
Although the constituent firms have pooled their resources for the most efficient conduct
of wool sales, yet each firm will preserve its separate identity and will continue to maintain its
individual relationship with its clients.
The organisation will be run by an executive committee drawn from the constituent firms,
and will be staffed almost entirely by employees of these firms.
The opening scries of sales can hardly include any new clip wool, but the London Brokers
look forward to the early re-appearance in their catalogues of wool consigned to this market
for sale. All Shippers will continue to receive the individual attention of Brokers as they have
done in the past.

contains enormous numbers of bacteria.
When a sheep’s system is undermined by
lack of food, the foreign matter in dirty
water irritates the digestive organs with
more dangerous results than in normal
seasons. Sheep are more liable to gastro-
intestinal troubles in a dry time and bac-
teria-charged water helps develop it.
Watering by a trough is better at all
times. In dry areas wells can be sunk
and water raised by windmills, and water
of this type is better than tank reserves..
Minus sediment of mud and dung, it s
fresh and clean. Sheep watered from
troughs don’t suffer from the parasitic
worms picked up in open tanks. Watei
with a heavy mud content can be purified
with chloride of lime —one part to every
million parts of water. Water is rarely
stagnant in bore drains.
Sheep need regular watering—particu-
larly when on dry feed. When they re
being handled, they’re likely to stand
round waiting for their rations and miss
the exercise gained by grazing. If daily
travelling to the water isn’t excessive and
the animals are not weak, they’ll beneiit
by the walk. Letting them have ready
access to water at all times is better still.
New Line of Exports.
“Bomba”: C. Minasi, of Wentworth-
ville (N.S.W.), pioneered an entirely new
line of Australian exports when he
started sending chickens to the apparently
inexhaustible market in Asia.
The chickens go from Minasi’s Davina
hatcheries by air to Singapore, and take
so well to it that the first batch of 400
Rhode Island Reds and others since have
arrived there without a single loss. A
standing order to fly 1000 of the chickens
on every available airliner has been
lodged with Qantas, and some 7000 will
probably be sent weekly towards re-
establishing the poultry industry in
Malaya alone.
Other parts of Asia are reported to be
a ready market for big consignments, and
Minasi’s orders include one for a con-
signment of Leghorns for Moscow.
There’s a touch of poetic justice on
the personal side of Minasi’s pioneering
of the Asian markets. The Japs are re-
puted to have eaten pretty well every
chicken in China and other parts they
overran, and in the war Minasi was in
an Australian anti-aircraft defence battery
by way of doing what he could to keep
the Japs away from here.
Hints for the Farm.
“Milton”: This is for sand-crack
(split hoofs). Procure a sharp lin.
or Hin. thin wood chisel, about
the thickness of a flat file; insert
a long hardwood handle (about
18in.), and, using a heavy hammer, trim
hoof—if long, starting from heel-to the
toe, cutting inward at an angle of about
45deg. and just below sole of hoof; where
flie crack touches the ground, cut off the
points on each side to make a large in-
verted Vto relieve pressure. Cauterise,
or use bluestone water in crack ; keep
Stockholm tar on coronet, and with atten-
tion the crack will grow out.
“Bail Up”: It’s a rum thing that a
bloke like “Rooster” (B. 3/ 7 / ’46), who
knows so much about how to run a dairy,
should fall down on something the little
children know. Where did he see cows
which perspire?
“Old Bill”: The cheapest and best food
for fattening table poultry is green maize
chopped small and mixed with a bind-
ing of pollard. Take any piece of land ;
break up anyway; broadcast the maize
seed ; rake in, and then cover liberally
with the cleanings and top layer of an
old poultry yard. Maize will grow to
anything up to 10ft., but is best used at
half-growth when it is succulent and
sugary. Ducks fed with the mash will
be rolling in fat and possess a distinctive
epicurean flavor of the maize. t
“B.”: If you value your dog, don t
let it sleep on concrete, because these
hard floors are always cold, and likely to
cause colds. Straw or clean bags make
ideal bedding for the kennel.
“Bennie”: When soil has been pro-
perly prepared for annuals, no manure
will be necessary until the plants are com-
ing into bloom. As soon as that period
approaches give applications of cow or
stable manure mixed with soot, using it
in liquid form of a very weak nature.
Water the ground thoroughly, then apply
the manure. About an hour later water
the foliage in case some of the manure
splashed on it.
“Xob33”: Germination of hard-shelled
seeds can be greatly assisted by soaking
them in warm water and kerosene for
about 24 hours before planting. Sow
immediately they are withdrawn from
the water.
“Rank-and-File”: A simple and effec-
tive method of sealing small leaks is to
mix quantities of ordinary wood ash and
fat together till the mixture is thick
enough to stick ; then liberally smear over
the hole. The cement-like substance seals
the hole and is effective even for long
periods. Incidentally, this same mixture
on a larger scale, when used on top of an
earth floor, sets like cement and makes
quite a good flooring for outhouses, etc.
“Will C”: Plant watermelons now in
warm districts. The best soil is a sandy
one, but heavy soil is better if you can’t
water freely as it holds moisture longer.
A fair amount of nitrogenous manure is
beneficial, but I’ve seen numerous in-
stances of luxuriant vines that bore little
fruit. The variety Klondyke V. 7 is miles
ahead of all other kinds where flavor is
concerned; it’s a big, striped melon.
Among the long green ’uns, Irish Grey,
Tom Watson, Kleckley Sweet and Sugar
Stick are excellent.

From Satan’s point of view
too many people have been investing their cash in
Bonds and Savings Certificates lately. It’s pincliing His Satanic Majesty’s
exchequer. So he’s trying to do something about it.
Of course, he doesn’t really need a million careless spenders—a few thousand will do,
Reckless spending forces up prices, whether it’s fried fish or fur colts which are in
short supply. Reckless spending is like a toboggan ride down a dangerous snow-
covered slope; it’s easy to start, fun while
it lasts, but the inevitable spill on the
rocky track at the bottom makes it far
too hazardous for sensible people.
But His Nibs doesn’t worry about your
neck—he is after your cash. He wants
to smash Price Control before produc-
tion catches up with demand. Don’t fall
for this trick.
Unbridled spending can have only one
outcome —a shortage of goods, inflated
prices, and more black markets. That’s
the kind of spill you’ll get at the end of
Old Nick’s toboggan slide.
You earned your money the hard, honest
way. Don’t let it slip through your
fingers like water.

To find a jewel somewhere and admire

Or to dress for a day in a gay outmoded

Pursued an ageless quest, untied a sack
To discover, not truth, but ancestral and

never believe it.
Though I walked through the city, and
boarded a tram to the Quay,
None of the crowd looked, swore, or

I conclude there was nothing strange that

NANCY KEESING.
MR. W|lSON'S ISLAND
By J. H. M. ABBOTT.
NORFOLK ISLAND, to which Mr.
Wilson has been appointed as
Administrator, lies in a lonely
waste of water about 1000 miles
north-east of Sydney and 400 or so north
of Auckland, and in its history and its
people is one of the most interesting islets
in all the South Seas.
Part of its war-time history has been
placed on record by Major-General
Charles Rosenthal, of Mont St. Quentin,
who preceded Mr. Wilson. “Old Rosey”
said that because it had been decided,
“for some reason or other,” that Aus-
tralian soldiers “should not fight east of
a certain line,” he, the Administrator of
a Commonwealth territory, had to see it
brought into the New Zealand zone and
garrisoned by New Zealanders, with the
admiral an American.
Most people know the story of the
mutiny in H.M.S. Bounty, and those who
don’t should make amends by learning
it, for it is an enthralling narrative of
romantic fact, told particularly well in
The Mutineers, by Louis Becke ana
Walter Jeffrey.
The tyranny that provoked the desper-
ate seizing of a King s ship, the amaz-
ing achievement of Lieutenant Bhgh in
navigating an open boat, with the few who
stood by him, some 3600 miles to Timor
in the Dutch East Indies, and the strange
story of the mutineers themselves give
material for one of the most interesting
yarns that have ever been written.
How the mutineers went back to
Tahiti, chose wives from among the
natives, went on to little Pitcairn Island,
burned the Bounty, founded a unique
community, quarrelled, fought, killed one
another, and finally multiplied until Pit-
cairn couldn’t sustain them, and then were
transplanted to Norfolk Island by the
British Government in 1857, between 60
and 70 years after the mutiny—it has all
been told. But it has never been told
quite as well as it might have been.
The descendants of the mutineers, who
today inhabit Norfolk Island, are as
strange and singular to the visiting out-
sider as an Australian abo. is to a Lan-
cashire lad. They have a curious lingo
of their own, made up of Tahitian,
eighteenth-century sailor slang and Eng-
lish. In grammatical structure it must
resemble the South African “Taal.” Their
gentle, soft, caressing voices, intensely
musical, recall their Tahitian extraction,
and their natural courtesy and kindliness
would seem also to have derived from
their Eastern Pacific origin. They will
possibly attempt a little legpulling (Mr.
Wilson, beware!), and they may laugh at
a stranger behind his back ; but they will
never be rude to him.
In a number of ways they are strangely
contradictory in character, but to a man
who takes them as he finds them, and
treats them decently, they cannot fail to
seem wholly charmiag and attractive.
Theirs is a truly independent little com-
munity, with its own separate existence as
a dependency of the Commonwealth—
except, of course, in war-time. The popu-
lation is well under 1000, with a slight
excess of females. For these are provided
all the equipment of a civilised State—
a good school, a chaplain, a lands official, a
postmaster and a police department. There
is (or was) an Executive Council, with a
President, whose name may be any of
those that were on the Bounty’s muster-
roll—Adams, Christian, Quintal or Buffet.
By way of taxation, every fit man has
to work for so many days each year upon
the fine roads which cross the island in
every direction —relics of the old convict
days—or find someone else to do the
job on his behalf at a fixed rate of pay.
They live by farming, grazing, fishing
and whaling. Every year, and always
about the same date, the whales turn up
off the island. Some time in May or
June they may be expected with certainty,
and they remain in the surrounding
“Do you own any property?”
“Just the family vault.”
waters until October or November. The
islanders hunt them enthusiastically, and
a day’s whaling with these super-boatmen
is a fine experience. But it isn’t so en-
joyable assisting to tow the whale back.
Some idea of the island’s extraordinary
tertiiity may be gamed from the fact that
during its convict era it supported nearly
3000 prisoners, officials and soldiers. It
is a paradise of peace and beauty nowa-
days, but a hundred years ago was such
a hell-upon-earth as has seldom been
matched anywhere. It was a dumping
place for the scum of the penal establish-
ments in Australia and Tasmania. The
ruins of the old prisons and barracks and
workshops still stand as reminders of the
sordid miseries and cruelties of the bad
old days. But that sad and dreary chap-
ter in its story is closed.
It would be hard to exaggerate its
beauty. It is like a lovely English park
planted down in the wide waters of the
Tasman Sea. From the top of Mount Pitt,
in the centre of the island (1000 ft.), it is
possible to realise its richness, and the
view is something you cannot forget. AH
around, like the view from a ship’s mast,
lies the vast blue circle of the sea, and
everywhere grows the tall pine (Araucaria
excelsd ) which makes the island famous.
Oranges and lemons, luscious guavas and
wonderful strawberries and every sort ot
European fruit are more than abundant.
And then, of course, there is Mr. Wilson,
who looks for guidance to Mr. Ward.

Another Comrade-Genius.
“A report from Russia reveals that a young
engineer who claims to have invented a car
that costs nothing to run has been hailed as the
Soviet’s potential Henry Ford. The car has no
engine, no gearbox, no fuel-tank.”
—“Sunday Sun.’
The short, stocky figure seated in the
chair that looked remarkably like a
throne leaned back and looked up.
Severe austerity was the keynote of
the modest 80ft.-iong room in the Krem-
lin where the Beloved Leader worked.
The floor was completely bare save for
a thick pile wall-to-wall carpet. The great
polished table, plate-glassed with utter
simplicity, bore nothing but a beaten
gold writing pad, several diamond-studded
gold fountain-pens, ivory telephones and
engraved boxes of cigars and tobacco.
The simple opal-and-ormolu encrusted
sideboard contained a meagre 120 kinds
of liquor. The sole mural decorations
were a giant mirror immediately facing
the Filhrer’s table, and about 100 oil
paintings that had once rested in the
galleries of Berlin, Vienna, Warsaw and
Budapest.
Everything, in fact, bespoke that
simplicity of his way of life which
the Propaganda Department had been
telling the world about continuously for
a decade. Even the statement Joe made
now was a simple one.
“The whole world will assuredly be-
lieve after this that the U.S.S.R. leads
in science and invention,” he said,
“Positively, Comrade-Fuhrer,” the
Commissar for Corruption agreed. “This
young inventor, Ivor Scroolewski, is in-
deed a genius—far greater, 1 truly believe,
than even that Comrade Nutski who
gained immortal fame for Soviet science
in the dark days of the Fascist invasion by
inventing the pushbike. In fact, 1 would
even go so far as to say his invention bids
fair to rival for sheer mechanical in-
genuity and world-shaking achievement
that of Comrade-Inventor, First Class,
Tomski Suisidovitch, who, you’ll re-
member, amazed the world by inventing
false teeth for cows.”.
“Well,” went on Joe, “by this mar-
vellous invention we have gained a great
industrial lead on the thieving, decadent
Western plutocracies. It is well. We can
now promise a cheap People’s Car to all
of our subjects—and the world will quake
to know that they now number 250 mil-
lions, including my Fifth Column in Aus-
tralia.” Here the Fiihrer leaped to his
feet, clenched his fist and cried “Ah! If
only I could rely on the loyalty of my
subjects inside the Fatherland as I can
on them /”
“The inventor estimates, Comrade-
Fiihrer,” went on the Commissar timidly
after the Beloved Leader had stopped
frothing at the mouth and resumed his
throne-seat, “that his car will cost only
1800 roubles to produce.”
Joe did some laborious calculations on
his pad. “Goodski!” he said at last.
“Draw up an edict for me to sign inform-
ing the people that every comrade-citizen
must voluntarily pay a deposit of 100
roubles on a car which will become his
after 35 further payments of 100 roubles.
“I shall invest the comrade-inventor
with the Order of the Brass Cigarette
Holder, Sixth Class, and one of the wire-
less sets looted from those workers’ flats
in Vienna. In the meantime order four
super de-luxe models for presentation to
myself and the first million de-luxe
models for army officers and party
officials. The rabble should start to get
their own ordinary models around 1980.”
A week later the Commissar for Corrup-
tion again appeared before the Beloved
Leader. He seemed agitated.
“My Comrade-Fuhrer, about that
engineless, fuelless, gearless car invented
by Comrade Scroolewski,” he began. “The
N.K.V.D. has ferreted out that the
young inventor is guilty of false pre-
tences.”
“In what way?” asked Joe angrily.
“Does it then take fuel to run the car?’
“No.”
“Well, if it goes without fuel, where
are. the false pretences?”
“It goes right enough, Comrade-
Fuhrer, although only on the level or
downhill. You see, the car is a high-
slung model and the motive power is the
legs of the driver, who runs along in a
hole made through the centre of the floor.
He claimed it cost nothing to run —that
constitutes false pretences. What about
bootleather?”
Joe took a savage swipe from a dipper
of vodka beside his elbow,
“Arrange for him to die of a heart ail-
ment,” he screamed, “and get the Polit-
buro to announce to the world that the
happy, contented citizens of the U.S.S.R.
will shortly enjoy cheaper and more
efficient private cars than the Americans.”

Timberworkers
President Dunphy, of the Westralian
State Arbitration Court, on a recent visit
to the Pemberton district, mentioned that
“the timberworkers did a good job
through the war.” Indeed they did and
only a few realise how good.
The vital timber needs of this State are
supplied by a mere handful of men, and
on their shoulders rests the responsibility
of all the highly-colored Government
building programmes and kindred enter-
prises.
The faller, the man who actually gets
the wood down, is a bush craftsman. He
must be skilled at doing up his tools, and
must store up' a knowledge of timber
and its ways, without which he would be
working in the dark. A good deal of
clotted nonsense is given forth about the
conditions under which coalminers and so
forth have to work, but in no other in-
dustry can you find such conditions as
are endured by the bushworker.
More often than not, he camps in a
tent, with a rough bark humpy slapped
up for shade. In the summer he must
cook all his stock at once to prevent it
going bad, and heat it up for subse-
quent meals. Coming back to camp after
knock-off he must splash in inadequate
water supplies and then cook his meal
over an open fire with the heat of the
day still making things unpleasant. All
his perishables suffer in the heat: butter
is frequently grease, bread dries up, and
it’s hard to keep tobacco in a decent,
smokable condition.
In the winter the picture is less en-
trancing. Nothing can be more miser-
able than a “wet camp,” and only those
who have worked hard in the rain can
know just how bleak a prospect this is
around daylight.
Fallers sometimes spend whole weeks,
perhaps months, without seeing “town.”
Sometimes this is deliberate to keep “off
the booze,” but the whole tenor of their
life is far from inducive to careful saving.
Danger is always present in the bush. It
works alongside the faller as he swings
his axe or pulls the saw. A few weeks
at a stretch give him a thirst that only
a bender can satisfy, and he generally
returns flat broke, possibly with a bottle
or so to taper off.
It would be an object lesson for some
of those “workers” striking against bad
conditions to spend a few days in a bush
camp. Efforts are being made to improve
them, but no company can run up blocks
of flats in the bush. The job of file bush
faller and his mates will always be a
pretty tough one. It was said of the old
windjammer days that they were days of
“wooden ships and iron men” ; the same
qualities of wood and iron survive in the
timber industry.—R. H. G. (W.A.),
Iron Ore for Japan?
Japan will need iron because the ore
reserve of Japan proper is only about
40,000,000 tons—enough to keep the U.S,
steel industry going for about one year
or the smaller Australian iron and steel
furnaces supplied for 12 or 14 years
Manchukuo is generally regarded as the
natural source of iron-ore for Japan,
but Manchukuo ore is of low metallic
content and, averaging only 34 to 37 per
cent, metal, it is unprofitable to work.
Australian iron-ore reserves are estimated
at one thousand million tons, and, al-
though all of this may not be economi-
cally workable, we have large reserves
and would afford to sell a fair annual
quota without endangering our future.
The most potent cause of war is refusal
to sell the raw materials which other
nations need for reasonable economic
development and well-being. The most
essential condition of a secure peace is
access by every nation to basic materials.
A fair proportion of Australian iron-
ore is at Yampi Sound, and a reasonable
quota could be shipped from there to
supply the Japanese market as readily as
wool can be shipped from Brisbane,
Sydney or Melbourne. — Alpha (8.C.0.F.,
Japan).
TJie Dutch
In all references to the failure of Aus-
tralia to help an ally by refusing to load
and repair Dutch ships, attention has been
drawn to the part played by Dutchmen
in the Pacific war. Apparently the suf-
ferings of these people in Europe have
,been forgotten. What about Rotterdam,
and the vain but costly effort to stem the
German invasion?
The Dutch people’s loss in the cause of
humanity is not measured in lives and
suffering alone. Much of their country
went back to the sea. Polder lands, which
had been reclaimed with long and
patient effort, were sacrified in thousands
of acres, first to keep the Germans out,
second by British bombers to harass the
German occupation, and finally to assist
British and Canadian troops in clearing
the enemy out of the Netherlands.
We, who have survived the war with
our people prosperous and our lands and
homes intact, should feel nothing but
shame for refusing to help an ally whose
sufferings were great, and who endured
the horrors of German ocupafion.
—D. J, H. (N.S.W.).
R.A.N. Pay
Any changes in conditions of service
in the post-war R.A.N. should in-
clude a revision of the pay system.
During the war the R.S.S.A.I.L.A. advo-
cated the adoption of paybooks in place
of the old ledger system, but there was
little result —paybooks were issued to
certain ratings, chiefly those who served
in defensively equipped merchant ships
and in ships attached to the Eastern
Fleet, but they were only a small pro-
portion.
The ledger system proved particularly
unsatisfactory when men were drafted
from one ship or establishment to
another. Frequent delays in the dispatch
of pay documents, containing Such de-
tails as pay due, allotments and daily
rate, condemned the unfortunate rating to
a series of “casual” payments, often re-
stricted to two pounds a fortnight. Need-
less to say, signal traffic requesting the
missing documents was pretty heavy.
Again, the wayfs of the “pay-bob”
were not appreciated by the matelot serv-
ing in small ships and stations whose
ledgers were borne possibly hundreds of
miles away at a major base. It was not
unusual for such ratings to get only one
small payment over a period of months.
The greatest confusion was experienced
with “demob.” routine. No statements
were issued with the final pay, and it
needed a financial genius to separate
outstanding pay from subsistence, cloth-
ing allowance, active and deferred pay
for leave due, and so on. The secre-
tariat staff was hard pressed, and could
not time off to separate the various
items. All Jack could do was scratch his
head and hope all was well.
The R.A.N. now consists largely of
new entries, including the secretariat
staff, and transition from the old system
to a more satisfactory method could be
accomplished without any great trouble,
—Ping (Vic.).
Military Law
Despite tinkerings with this or that
section, the Army Act (B. 3/ 7/’46) as a
whole is framed to discipline an army of
bygone days when social caste determined
a man’s rank, and when the rank and file
were recruited from rustic chawbacons or
the offscourings of the cities.
Today an army must be a keener and
finer instrument. The individual is in-
creasingly important, and an army needs
the very best of young manhood. It can
never reach this peak while the rank and
file feel that they have no rights and few
privileges, and while discipline is external
and forced on the soldier from above.
A strict set of rules of procedure for
orderly-rooms should be laid down, and
the C.O. should be the president of a
“Unit Court-martial” instead of the sole
arbiter. The remaining members of the
court should be drawn from* a panel of
exemplary soldiers. And the maximum
penalty should be expulsion from the unit.
District courts-martial also should have
at least one member of the court of the
same rank as the accused.
It may sound unworkable, but if the
hoodlum and criminal elements were
rigorously excluded from combat units
and a greater degree of responsibility for
personal and corporate welfare given to
the members of those units, the system
would work and pay dividends. The
urger, the scrounger and the bludger could
sometimes hoodwink officers and even
n.c.os., but his fellow-soldiers had no
illusions about him.
Detention barracks are not worth the
cost of their upkeep. If a man with the
makings of a soldier falls from grace he
should be given a chance to rehabilitate
himself in a refresher course, followed
by a remuster if he wanted it.
It may be objected that this system
would keep the waster and hoodlum out
of the line while his betters risked their
lives. Just so. But the present system
does exactly that without acknowledging
it. Men who would be liabilities in any
army are carried on the muster rolls.
They seldom see battle. They cause more
worry and disorganisation than so many
casualties and they constitute a menace
to the discipline and efficiency of the
whole show. They are unfit for soldier-
ing and that fact should be recognised.
The general idea at present seems to be
to get them into battle if possible in the
hope that they will see the light at the
last moment. It never comes off.
Military law, as we know it, has failed
because it was framed to fit circumstances
that no longer exist, and because, as it
stands at the moment, it needs the lash
and the firing party to back it up. What
we need is a new army and a new code
to regulate its 1ife.—82069 (N.S.W.).
“Snarlers”
“Snarlers” is the serviceman’s apt term
for discharges endorsed “Services no
longer required.” They were given to
men who cost their country the same
per head as the fighting men, plus the
cost of trials, courts-martial and their
keep in compounds or detention barracks
with attendant guards.
For such men the services meant some-
thing for nothing and a chance to see the
world at no expense. Their feet grew
cold with the approach of actual fighting,
they developed all manner of complaints,
tried for behind-the-line jobs, and de-
serted. The fighting men were glad to
lose them.
Some good jobs in action were done by
men who had an A.W.L. record. But the
average Digger has an infinite contempt
for “Snarlers”!
Mr. Forde should explain why all
these fellows were not fully penalised
and given bad discharges; why deserters
were not hounded systematically till
caught, and punished instead of having
their discharges so kindly forwarded to
their last known address. —W- S. B. (Q.).
A.W.L.
Soldiers are not cold, inanimate things
like Victoria Barracks desks. That is why
I’m amused at “Peter Mike’s” poor view
of the prevalence of a.w.l. during the
war (B. 3/7/’46). According to an
earlier letter he saw service as an officer,
and officers had the opportunity of taking
home leave every six months. Most of
them did. Other ranks were granted leave
once a year—if they were very lucky.
I knew men who served in the islands
for 30 months before getting leave. Most
of them took an extra week and paid the
piper before beginning, for all they knew,
another 30 months. Except to anyone
with a routine order where his heart
should be, this was understandable.
“Peter Mike’s” charge that certain types
sought detention in order to dodge cam-
paigns would not have been made by any-
one with the slightest knowledge of what
a detention barracks was like. As a
driver whose job took me the rounds of
those detestable places, I know that a six
months’ jungle campaign would have been
preferable to a week in an army jail.
There were easier ruses open to the
dodgers, anyway. If “P.M.” has any
knowledge of L.T.D. procedure he’U
know about them.
Finally, his scorn for the attitude that
“I DO wish you 'd come into dinner—I cant keep it hot!”
“viewed every man in uniform as a
national hero” smacks of being wise after
the event. During the war that attitude
was encouraged by every public figure
from Mr. Churchill downwards. — Bondi
Beachcomber (N.S.W.).
Objection Noted
That Bulletin cartoon (17/7/’46) of
Q.M.S. J. B. Chifley is an excellent piece
of craftsmanship. But, as an Old Digger,
I protest most strongly against the P.M.
being cartooned in any garb which re
motely suggests an association with the
A.1.F., either first or second. — Sandpatch
(N.S.W.)
“No Moral Wrong”
On whatever system a country may be
rpn a code of morals as understood by
ordinary people is a necessary basis f or
conduct in all aspects of life. To treat
stealing from a private employer as be-
ing different from stealing from, say, a
Socialist Government is muddled think-
ing and very dangerous.
Holding an ordinary man’s view about
property I was staggered to read in a
Socialist rag that the editor “sees no
moral wrong in the petty and large-scale
thieving from the employing-class thieves
which is rampant and a part, of every-
day life.”
The appetite grows with what it feeds
upon, and one can hardly imagine a
wholesale conversion to honesty following
right on the heels of a change to Social-
ism.—Zabut (Vic.).
Preference
It is not sufficient for servicemen to
sit back and say that employers must
carry out the preference principle and
that the Government should see that they
do. What about the man who starts on
his own in a profession or business?
Isn’t he entitled to expect preference from
his former comrades-in-arms?
Every day I notice lawyers who had
no service appearing for ex-service
clients, dentists who were never in uni-
form attending to ex-servicemen and
their families, non-service barbers cutting
hair once cut in the field by a “unit
barber,” and bakers, butchers and grocers
competing successfully against ex-Diggers
for custom of ex-servicemen.
In some instances there may be reason
for it, but other things being equal those
who expect preference should assist in
making it a universal matter— El
Capitan (S.A.).
In this Queensland coastal town a
number of ex-servicemen have returned
and, without any fuss or bother, are
quietly rehabilitating themselves. They
have made no plea for preferential treat-
ment. Some have jobs in banks, the post
office and the town council; some have
started up independently— two painters,
an accountant, a general carrier, a
mechanic, a boot repairer and a fruiterer.
Bill’s case is typical. With a small
utility he began a door-to-door green-
grocery service, and, working round the
clock for a six-day week, he has built
up a sound business.
Local sentiment towards ex-servicemen
is reflected in the fact that an ex-R.A.A.F.
man was elected mayor at the last muni-
cipal elections with an absolute majority
over his two rivals.
People who imagine that the ex-service-
man must be wrapped in swaddling
clothes and gently nursed on to his feet
have the wrong idea. Such an attitude
tends to undermine rather than strengthen
self-reliance. Local ex-servicemen illus-
trate that rehabilitation is essentially a
matter of courage. If ex-servicemen
generally show the same spirit there will
be no rehabilitation problem.— Blue (Q.).
Rehab, and Pensions
An ex-Digger I know applied for a £250
loan to start a business. He was told
that he was not eligible because, having
been discharged medically unfit, he was
not considered fit to run his own business.
So he applied for a pension, and after
about six months was told that his dis-
abilities didn’t warrant it. He has thrown
that at the rehab, mob, and is waiting
with a broad grin on his dial to see what
they’ll do about it.
He doesn’t want the loan now —he got
it months ago from a bank that con-
sidered him a good enough risk."
Gravelsnatcher (W.A.).


Jews and the British Commonwealth
In 1940-41 Germany tried to win over
Palestinian Arabs by promising them all
the Jewish possessions. The apportioning
was thorough: every Arab village knew
which Jewish settlement it was to plunder
if Britain were defeated and individual
Arabs knew the share they were to re-
ceive. Male “Yehoodi” were to be
slaughtered. Females were assigned to
prospective Arab masters. A Jewess in
Beer-Tuvya told me she knew the Arab
from Masmiya Al Kabira by whom she
would be claimed if Germany won.
The blood and guts of Tommies and
Australians, Kiwis and Springboks saved
Palestine. Many Jews showed their warm
gratitude to us. Our men were enter-
tained in their homes and in their settle-
ments. I saw a Jewish soldier punch a
Jewish taxi-driver who had blasphemed
in Hebrew against some Australians after
having been caught overcharging them.
Evidently all this is forgotten.
Even when Palestine was threatened
with German invasion, and the blood
spilled in defending the Jews from the
Arabs had barely dried, the Stern gang
was active and British policemen were
being murdered. At that time the Stern
gang was condemned by most decent
Jews. Yet it now appears that great
numbers of Jews in English-speaking
countries are on the side of the ruffians
who have declared a war of assassins and
dynamiters against Britain.
What is to be achieved by them is not
clear. If it is the withdrawal of British
troops and administration, then the Jews
are trying to commit suicide. In the case
of an open conflict, Jewry would be up
against the whole forces of Islam, and
even if settlements were successful in de-
fending themselves for a while they could
not stop their crops from being destroyed
or their stock driven away. In any case,
the Jews would have to fight a defensive
battle, which would be a losing one in
the long run.
Viewing all the hateful proceedings in
Palestine and the reactions of Jews in
other parts of the world, with honorable
exceptions like Isaac Isaacs and Sol Bloom
and their followers, one must come to the
conclusion that the Jew is his own greatest
enemy.—M. JC (N.S.W.).
Never Idle
Although it is eight rfionths since I re-
turned from a Jap prison camp, I’m still
hearing of things that are new to me.
The other day I picked up a newspaper
dated October 6, 1944, and was most
interested to see a headline, “£200,000,000
Plan to Give 50,000 Men Farms.” The
news item went on to say that it was
intended to settle 50,000 ex-servicemen on
the land, that 6000 applications had been
received in N. S. Wales alone, and that
2000 had been approved. The plan
probably fooled many a serviceman into
thinking he would really get a farm.
Another headline on the same page
reads, “No Early Move Likely on Drink-
ing Hours.” In the body of the news
item was the cryptic statement, “The Gov-
ernment admits that some reform is
necessary, but wants to act at the appro-
priate time.” Apparently the “appropri-
ate time” is some time in the nebulous
future.
It is a great satisfaction to know that
while one was locked up the present
Government was never idle. It has
bundles of plans to prove it. — Tidak

Incentive to Farmers
Forde, M.H.R., recently cast up in
Rockhampton and proclaimed that Aus-
tralia is home on the pig’s back if we
get a good season. He blathered that
“incentive had been given farmers by
way of the Wheat Stabilisation Bill.”
Had Mr. Forde essayed to sell his
incentive to wheat men on the
Darling Downs he would have been
asked what incentive there is in
legislation which demands of growers
both the wheat and the “dough” for
the stabilisation fund. He would have
been asked what incentive there is when
wheatgrowers will have to take about 4s.
3d. a bushel for wheat at country sidings
when wheat prices throughout the world
are the highest in history and more likely
to rise than to fall. And for a certainty
he would have had to explain where the
incentive comes in when the Stabilisation
Bill will grab close on half the proceeds
of the 1945-46 harvest and put it into a
fund for the assistance of growers in
years to come.
Wheat men fervently hope the Capri-
cornian optimist is right in his prediction
that “Australia is likely to produce a
surplus of 120,000,000 bushels of wheat
for export.” As they are more ex-
perienced in weather signs, they are in-
clined to grin at his further prophecy that
“Australia will be shipping wheat to
the full capacity of her inland transport
until November, 1947,” a prediction he
qualified by saying “the Government
hopes to ship 150,000,000 bushels of
wheat and flour during the next 18
months.” “This,” he added, “represents
1500 full shiploads.” Fifteen hundred
full shiploads in 18 months! Twenty
ships a week! Mr. Forde must have an
option over the whole Soviet fleet.
Queensland’s “flourbag,” the Darling
Downs, is experiencing its driest and
coldest winter for years. Scarcely an
acre of wheat has been sown, nor has
there been planting of oats, barley or
canary seed. The next few weeks will
decide whether Queensland will have to
import its domestic flour requirements.
Queensland meat production has gone
“mulga” because of drought and illegal
strikes. Cattle which should have been
slaughtered weeks ago have deteriorated
to store condition. Still Mr. Forde’s
brother-opportunist Mr. Scully blithely
opines that cattle which could not be
slaughtered will retain their prime condi-
tion when he extends the killing season
into September.
In Mr. Forde’s own electorate butter
production is lowest for 12 years. The
Darling Downs Co-operative Butter
Association made 729 tons of butter dur-
ing last February ; for June the manufac-
ture dropped to 232 tons and for July
it will be smaller. Toowoomba butter
factory pasteurised and processed into
cheese 22,000 gallons of milk daily in
February; for June only 8000 gallons
of milk daily was received. The
whole of southern Queensland and
the Northern Rivers are experienc-
ing similar falls in production, but
Mr, Forde bravely expects that “Aus-
tralia’s export of foodstuffs in the next
12 months may well exceed 3,000,000
tons, including 70,000 tons of butter and
45,000 tons of cheese and milk products.”
Of course he has already begun elec-
tioneering—Arden (Q.).
The Gratuity
The Commonwealth Government has
just informed me of the amount of
gratuity to which I’m entitled, and, as
income-tax returns are due, I’ve been
doing a few calculations. On the present
scale my weekly tax deduction is £1 Bs.,
or nearly £73 a year. As I pay a fair
wad of life assurance, the net result can
be calculated at £350 in the five years for
which the gratuity is payable. The
gratuity, plus my deferred pay with in-
terest, is almost exactly £350.
I was never much impressed by the
Government’s song and dance about the
gratuity, but isn’t it time someone on the
Government benches honestly admitted
that the ordinary hard-working returned
serviceman is being asked to pay his own
gratuity plus a fair slice of his army
pay?— Exkewex (Q.).
The Professions
“Professor’s” remarks on the profes-
sions (B. 3/ 7 / ’46) should be a warning
to the thousands of ex-servicemen and
others who seem to think a profession
the way of making money. They can
only bring disappointment and trouble to
themselves and danger to the community,
because the inevitable result of over-
crowding in the professions is a reduc-
tion in ethical and technical standards.
This is particularly true of the law,
which is the cheapest and, therefore, the
most attractive of them all. The pub-
lic’s ideas of legal income, based on the
fantastic figures of a few English
barristers, is laughable, particularly in
the poorer States. The number of S.A.
solicitors (as distinct from barristers-
and the distinction can be made in spite
of the amalgamation of the two branches
of the profession) who have a constant
income of over £lOOO a year could be
numbered on the fingers of both hands.
Magistrates (some of whom are the
equivalent of the County or District
Court Judges of the Eastern States) re-
ceive from £750 to £lOOO a year, accord-
ing to their status.
Recently a Government department
called for a solicitor at £5OO. Two men
were eventually appointed—one had been
practising for 14 years, the other longer.
Both are competent and highly regarded
by their colleagues. Such is the standard
of legal incomes.
In the Eastern States the fees, for ex-
ample, on land transfers increase on a
sliding scale according to the value of
the land until they reach the hundred
pound vicinity. In S.A. there is a flat
fee of 305., and licensed land brokers are
qualified on equal terms with the solici-
tor. There are, of course, higher fees
to be earned at the Bar, but success at
the Bar is slow, the going is strenuous,
and few can survive. Even that success
is not in proportion to the effort. The
fingers of both hands would also num-
ber the barristers who earn more than
£2OOO a year.
The implications of these facts are
illustrated by the state of the legal pro-
fession in the U.S. during the depres-
sion. In one State 700 lawyers were
admitted to practice on one day; com-
petent men, after 15 years’ practice,
could not earn £lO a week. Said one of
the more successful:
The competition is terrific. Lawyers
scurry about' like newsboys in an effort
to drum up business. Under prevailing con-
ditions, legal ability is not a prerequisite
to success; the lawyer without connections
is a business-getter, or he rots in his office.
The glamor of the professional career is
worn and cracked, and the arts and wiles
of the market place have supplanted ethics.
The forbidden practices of barratry, cham-
perty and maintenance flourish extensively,
often in ultra-modem form. So boldly,
indeed, are ethics flaunted that we have
had in recent swift succession a receiver-
ship scandal, an ambulance-chasing scandal,
and a jury-fixing scandal, besides a series
“Any of you hots pinch my cigaretle papers ?”
of minor eruptions The insecurity and
harassments which have made the practice
of the law so dismal today are due princi-
pally to overcrowding.
The youngster who is suited by apti-
tude and inclination to a profession
should not be dissuaded. For him
struggle, with a chance of success, is
sufficient prize, (and there is the still
limited room at the top. But for those
who are thinking in terms of income a
small business would be more profitable,
—Nisi Primus (S.A.).
“Not Reliable Records”
One lesson learned from Queensland’s
industrial trouble was that union books
are not reliable records of membership.
A secretary of one of them blandly ad-
mitted as much when making excuses for
opposing the secret ballot. Imagine the
secretary of a public company saying to a
Board meeting that his lists of share-
holders were incomplete! Of course, any
excuse is good enough for the rank and
file and the public, but it raises the ques-
tion of exactly why these secretaries draw
salaries. If they don t know who is en-
titled to union benefits, and who is sub-
ject to compulsory levies, what do they
do to earn their money?
Some “village Hampden among the
strikers has been inquiring as to what
check is made at mass meetings to ensure
that all those participating in shows of
hands” are entitled to do so. So far he
has been met with a wall of silence, but
it is to be hoped that the Arbitration
Court will take notice and insist on an in-
dependent audit of union records with
appropriate penalties for carelessness or
falsification
Leaders of Church and State are agreed
that most of the industrial trouble is
generated by a small, foreign-inspired
minority with no interest in the welfare
of the worker. So there is hope that
Queensland—which once had the repu-
tation of being the most socialistic of the
States—will come to believe in the old
concept of “a fair day’s work for a fair
day’s pay,” with the Arbitration Court
as umpire —Five by Two (Q.).
TWs and Universities
1 «r gS tfv uiv f i ar,ri
Wouldn t the abolition of slums nd
the institution of free, compulsory uni-
versity education go a long way towards
eradicating prevalent larrikinism and
thuggery? It would cost plenty, I know,
but where’s the sense in improving parks
and streets while slums and children of
slums still need attention?
Young people can’t be expected to
grow up in slums without developing
cramped minds. Their normal youthful
energies must have outlets, and police
clubs and the like are not enough. The
slums breed violence, because the poorly
educated mind, combined with fiercely
energetic bodies, almost inevitably pro-
duces anti-social behavior. Improved
living conditions and a higher school-
leaving age are the cures.
Higher education should not be limited
to the moneyed class or to the outstand-
ing minority who can win free tuition,
Almost anyone, if started along the right
educational paths, will find some subject
of absorbing interest and leam the re-
finement of better manners. Slum kids
leave school as soon as possible, taking
the first job offering, or none if dis-
honesty seems to present quicker and
easier means of living.
Even with higher education there’d
still be men who’d prefer other than
white-collar jobs. But a wharflaborer
with a university education isn’t a ridicu-
lous thought—he’s human and entitled to
the best in mental training. Bad men
are the result of bad homes, bad living
conditions and bad education. — Eve
Merritt (N.S.W.).
Golden Dream
Alex. Strachan definitely stated (B.
1/5/’46) that Mounts Madden and
Buchanan are at the head of the Palmer
River, with lodes 100 feet wide which
would bulk lOdwt. per ton. Actually,
Madden and Buchanan are 40 miles from
the Palmer head. Geological reports
by the late Robert Logan Jack state
that Madden is 200 feet high at the
most. The so-called lodes show no direc-
tion in trend, and are much faulted,
Practical miners generally believe that
the whole formation is a mass of loose
boulders. If samples taken over 50 years
a S° did assay from 15dwt. to 47dwt. its
a wonder mining companies did not
operate. D. Gavin (Q.).

Loans on rolicies
“Onlooker” (B. 15/5/ 46) might have
added that loans on life-assurance policies
before August 11, 1944, pay six per cent.
interest. Rates should have been
decreased automatically after that date
to the legal rate of per cent,
The simple way to counteract this
practice on the part of insurance corn-
panies is to transfer the policy to any
bank. The latter will charge 4f per cent,
and charge it on a daily balance. There
is thus an incentive to pay off the pnn-
cipal in any small sum which ma> be
available from week to week.
There is the further advantage that a
policy-holder can at any time draw to
the limit of the security covered by his
policy—and no extra lees are involved,

“SHELL TELLS”: No. 4 of a Series.
SHELL
designed and constructed a system for
PIPING PETROL
all over blitzed Englaifd
In 1941 it was decided to
lay a great network of oil
pipelines in England, since
half her blitzed ports could
not be used, and her road and
rail transport was under
terrific strain.
The responsibility of design-
ing and constructing the whole
system was given to Shell.
Innumerable difficulties
were overcome. All the pipe-
lines shown by the thick lines
on the map were ready three
months before D-day, supply-
ing high-octane aviation fuel,
motor spirit, and kerosine, for
the great air offensive and the
vast invasion army.
Shell did it—was able to do
it because Shell is trained to
serve !
