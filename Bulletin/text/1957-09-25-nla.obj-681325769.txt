DURHAM'S CASTLE GATEWAY
IN medieval times the Bishops of Durham were temporal as well
A as spiritual lords and they ruled and defended the north of
England with the powers of a viceroy sovereign. Ihe bishops" seat
Mas the massive Durham castle, which was.' founded by William the
Conqueror in 1072 and which is separated from the cathedral by
Palace Green.
The castle commands the narrow neck of the loop formed by
the River Wear, which almost surrounds the steep bluff on which
both castle and cathedral stand. William the Conqueror, when
journeying through the north of England, realised the natural
advantages of Durham’s, location as a fortress against the northern
invaders. His fortress withstood all attacks and resisted every siege.
As a result he and his successors encouraged the growth of a strong
self-contained community. The Prince Bishops of Durham had
their own parliament, armies, mint and courts of law. .Today, the
Durham Chancery Court is a relic of those days and state apartments
within the castle are reserved for the Judges of Assize when on
circuit.
Since 1836 the castle has been occupied by University College,
which is part of Durham University. The castle is approached by
a path nhich marks the site of the ancient barbican and moat,
leading to the impressive entrance gateway, shown in the accompany-
ing illustration. It still preserves softie of its Norman features and
the core is Norman but the upper part and the external casing are
the work of James Wyatt in the late eighteenth century.
Among the many interesting features within the castle are the
vast kitchens dating from 1499, and one of the tables still in use is
400 years old. Above the minstrels’ gallery is a fine collection of
Cromwellian armour. Some of the finest examples of early Norman
Sculpture can be seen in the small in the crypt, which is
similar in style to the Chapel of St. John in the Tower of London.

IN WILDEST ARNHEM LAND
“Long live the wild and the wilder-
ness yet!” said Gerard Manley
Hopkins, hoping that even the British
Isles would not become too urbanised;
and any Australian who may be
tempted to utter a similar prayer
should be considerably consoled by
Wilbur Chaseling’s Yulengor: Nomads
of Arnhem Land (Epworth Press), for
it is a very wild country he describes,
wilder than most of us know.
It is even, apparently, still possible
to be bitten here by cannibals: for
Chaseling, though he is not always
specific about his dates, went to
Arnhem Land in 1934 (as a Methodist
missionary after there had been a
massacre) and writes of quite recent
times:—
I saw hordes beyond Boucaut
Bay practising a form of cannibal-
ism and eating their dead. A wealth
of tradition lies behind this custom,
which originated with the eating of
their tribal ancestress.
It is also possible—at least it was
instantly upon Chaseling’s arrival with
his wife—to receive a friendly visit
from a pack of murderers (or perhaps
they should be called officers of
justice):—
A dozen men and boys paddled out
in their big dugout canoes and came
aboard somewhat diffidently. How-
ever, they were soon squatting round
the hatch exchanging news with the
crew, all the time passing the one
and only bush pipe backwards and
forwards and drawing deeply the first
tobacco-smoke they had tasted for
months. Most of them were strong
and well-developed, with bushy hair,
but not too clean. As a concession
to the white man they had donned
strips of bark on string waistbands.
r .... .After the visitors had cast-off
in their canoes a crew-boy mentioned
that our visitors had just returned
from killing a man in revenge for
the death of another in the hills
behind our anchorage.
And it is possible, again, though
perhaps not for missionaries, to have
twenty-six wives:—
Some families have as few as three
members ; the largest I saw was that
in which Wonggu had twenty-six
wives and fifty children .
Polygamy is an ancient custom and
has an economic basis, for the
women are the chief food-gatherers
and are coveted as assets and never
regarded as expensive luxuries.
Those who are inclined to envy
Wonggu the simple restfulness of his
existence will envy still more the ease
with which they keep their wives in
order:—
Stone Age man is expected to
control his women..... Old Barat-
juna reclined in his camp whilst
his wives prepared for the hunt.
Some were going to a distant swamp,
others were to forage near by. One
wife wanted to go to the swamp but
her husband told her to stay in the
camp and mind the young children.
She complained for a time, and,
seeing that she provoked no response,
she made a move to go to the swamp.
But before she had taken a dozen
paces her husband threw his stone
axe at her and broke a rib; that, as
far as he was concerned, ended the
incident.
It should be added that, despite such
incidents, Chaseling denies that Arnhem
Land women are treated with “constant
brutality.” On the contrary: —
Women join in all camp disputes
—indeed, with their gossip they often
cause them —and their voices can be
heard above the din of shouting men
and howling dogs.
There are times, it is true, when
amidst all this howling wilderness
Chaseling rather disappoints our
appetite for wonders. He is severe on
message-sticks, which he says are
merely aids to memory, not a form of
written correspondence as they are so
often claimed to be by popular
romancers; and he won’t have it that
smoke-signals are anything more than
the ordinary beacons lighted by all
peoples without other means of long-
distance communication:—
Probably the most popular of all
delusions concerning the nomad is
that he sends messages by means of
smoke. I am not aware that any
aboriginal has ever sent any coded
signal by smoke ; yet, on the other
hand, they will interpret smoke-fire
as indicating the presence of visitors
and will light fires for an easily
understood purpose or in accordance
with a prearranged plan.... Smoke
is sent up as a warning signal when
anything untoward happens, and a
passing lugger is enough to start a
line of fires The rapidity with
which detailed messages are passed
from one camp to another has led
to the assumption that information
has been sent by secret smoke-
signals. But the message-carriers are
human.
It is a pity to be robbed of our fairy-
tales; but at least there is an extra-
ordinary account of the sign-language
by which the Arnhem Landers hold
silent and secret conversations—
“ Reference to police is made by placing
the wrists side by side and holding
them in front to suggest handcuffs.
Macassar proas and sailing-boats are
indicated by stretching an arm forward,
clenching the hand and raising the
thumb for a mast.” The sign for a
white man, one is grieved to learn, is
“bending the elbows” ... an extremely
equivocal gesture which Chaseling,
mercifully, believes is related to firing
a gun.
There are stories of the aborigines

Men of the Morning Mist
1.
They knew life in the mornings of mist
as they took the iong-helved fork
and walked silent through the soaking
grass
past cattle of softly-sculptured chalk
until they came to where they could
stand
and hear low whispers as the sea
soothed, with long smooth lingers, sand
on a desolate mist-barren shore.
2.
Sea and mist, and the mew of the gull
cascades through the heart
and mind; the listener turns to hear
again *
the whisper of the sand, and start
the chorus ringing, singing, through the
mist; then
gossamer-thin on the branches of night
it circles the hills and lodges again
near the gull and the mist and the
sea.

THE SKY THE LIMIT
THE Graziers’ Association has
demanded an inquiry into the almost-
vertical rises in the pay and numbers of
Federal civil servants, and if ever an
inquiry was needed it is here.
Ministers frequently point out that
civil-service pay represents only a
tithe of the Budget, and for that
reason they seem to think that a few
millions here or there don’t matter.
But the fact remains that what Sir
Henry Parkes held is true —give a
civil servant a table by himself in a
passage and before you know where
you are he has created a department.
The departments now fairly teem
with persons attached to massive titles
like director, assistant - secretary,
economic adviser, liaison - officer,
extensions-officer and archives-officer,
and every department is split-up into
sub-departments, divisions, branches
and whatnot.
Parliament itself sets the pace both
in the extravagance in salaries and in
the steady and steep rises in the
standards of remuneration which have
become meat for general public
indignation.
With the exception of a few officers,
there are no toilers in Australia with
easier or less-onerous jobs than the
officials of the House of Representa-
tives, and more particularly the Senate.
The Sergeant-at-Arms in 1953-54
received what appeared to be the more-
than-adequate salary of £1626 a year,
which was about twice what he
received before the war. He now gets
over £2lOO a year, and that is only
peanuts on the Parliamentary staff.
The clerks of the House of Representa-
tives and Senate each get £4250 a year,
against the £2400 they received in
1954. The clerk-assistants in each
House have gone up from £2210 to
£3200; the second assistant-clerk has
£2546, the Usher of the Black Rod in
the Senate gets the same as the
Sergeant-at-Arms in the Lower House,
and the Parliamentary Librarian
receives £3750, and is one of the few
among the lot, save the Clerk of the
Reps., who has responsibilities com-
mensurate with his pay. Total salaries
of the clerical and attendant staff of
the two Houses have jumped from
£43,200 in 1953-54 to £64,000-odd in
1957-58, with three more officers on the
payroll.
These, of course, do not exhaust the
higher-bracket officials of the Parlia-
ment. The chief Parliamentary reporter
gets £3500, which is the same salary
as is paid to the Australian Ambassador
to the United States. He has a second
reporter at £2BOO-odd, a third-reporter
at £2600, three supervisors at an
average of £2500, and 17 reporters
who get an average of over £2200 a
year—the lowest salaries seem to be
on a level with daily-newspaper men
of top-grade status and national
reputation.
The Treasury is a magnificent
example of what is going on in the
realm of the great salary-ramp. In
1954 it was managed by a secretary at
£4lOO a year, “inclusive of allow-
ances”; it had a central secretariat
controlled by two administrative officers
drawing between them £2757.
In the past three years the salary
of the secretary has gone up to £6OOO
a year—not too much for that particu-
lar job—and the two administrative-
officers have had a joint rise of £l3OO.
A new addition, “Deputy Secretary,”
draws £4500. There were eight main-
headquarters sub-departments in 1954
whose heads were drawing from £2122
to £2804, which seemed enough in all
conscience.
The same officials designated
variously have been raised to a salary-
range of from £3400 to £4300 —the
majority get over £4OOO a year. And
an advertising division has been added
with a director and deputy-director
drawing £49oo—and controlling three
typists.
These, of course, represent only the
front-line of the Treasury parade of
opulence.
Three years ago the Prime Minister’s
Department used to get along somehow
with a secretary at £3350 and four
deputy - secretaries getting £B7BO
between them. Now there is a secretary
at £6OOO a year, and seven (instead of
four) deputies drawing £22,869. The
chief economic adviser’s pay has gone
up from £2494 to £4lOO, and there are
49 in the deputy-assistant class drawing
an average of £l5OO a year, though
some of them are only clerks and
assistant-inspectors. The Deputy High
Commissioner in London has gone up
from £3OOO to £5OOO, plus exchange,
£1268; his official secretary has had a
rise from £2lOO to £3200. The one
assistant-secretary of 1954 at £1639 is
now two at an average of £2200.
It would be monotonous to reiterate
the theme of expansion and increase
that has gone on throughout the service
and the useless offices that are kept up
and which have no real justification
save to find a job for somebody.
The idea of maintaining an
Ambassador to Burma at £25,800 and
a Legation to Cambodia at £15,000 is
not likely to be attractive to taxpayers
however it may inflate the ego of the
External Affairs Department. But it is
even less attractive when the effects of
its example are studied.
Three years ago the Department of
Commerce and Agriculture was a
union, which seemed sensible in view
of the nature of the export trade. But
the department has now been split in
two—a Department of Trade and a
Department of Primary Industry, with
part of the Department of Trade and
Customs tacked on to the former. And
whereas in 1954 the combined jobs of
the two departments were managed by
a secretary at £3350, two first-assistants
at £2200, plus three ordinary assistants
at about £2OOO each, the Trade
Department now has a secretary at
£6OOO, the Primary Industries Depart-
ment one at £5OOO. Trade has a deputy-
secretary at £4500. P.I. has now two
first-assistants, average £3550 each.
Moreover, the departments have
mutually ballooned in the most
awesome manner. The Trade Depart-
ment has built its own foreign service
in emulation of the External Affairs
Department, calling it a “commercial
intelligence service,” which reaches out
into every comer of the world whether
there is any trade or not, but which
has had to send a delegation to Indo-
nesia to find out why the devalued franc
has taken Australia’s flour-export trade
away! Central Africa has our trade-
mission headed by a £3OOO-a-year
potentate; the British West Indies is
similarly endowed; there are three
trade-commissioners at around £2900,
plus three assistant trade-commissioners
and a consular clerk in India main-
tained at a cost of £31,000 a year,
against the £12,000 spent three years
ago, and against the £lB,OOO now spent
in Japan and the £14,000-odd spent in
the United Kingdom.
There are so many trade-missions
that it is now necessary to maintain a
special department to hold those who
are employed in “relieving-work and
transit”—there are twelve full com-
missioners and assistant-commissioners
with average salaries well over £2OOO
a year in this section alone.
A royal commission is certainly
needed—one without public-service
connections and one which will inspire
the confidence of the country. The
position is a ramp which is not confined
to any single department. It runs
throughout the services. And the same
is becoming true of some of the State
Administrations.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Cleansing Sydney Council
There’ll never be any unemployment
problem in Australia if the principle
adopted by the Sydney City Council
becomes common practice. It’s very
simple. If two men apply for a job
and you can’t decide between the two
you just split the job in halves and make
’em both happy. It isn’t known yet
whether the principle is to be adopted for
all council jobs ; it is being tried out first
in the cleansing department.
The bright idea seems to have come to
Lord Mayor Jensen after his Labor
caucus had been deadlocked for three
weeks over the appointment of a successor
to the retiring assistant-superintendent of
cleansing. The Lord Mayor and four of
his party colleagues supported the
application of the chief clerk, S. Donnan,
who also had the approval of the super-
intendent. Deputy Lord Mayor Byrne
and four other aldermen preferred J.
Sonerson, cleansing-supervisor, southern
district.
Donnan had seniority in council
service and had passed local-government
examinations. Non-Labor aldermen were
unkind enough to suggest that Sonerson’s
Labor League membership was his chief
qualification for the job, but the Lord
Mayor refuted this by saying that both
men were “outstanding applicants.” He
said that Sonerson was qualified to con-
trol field-operations, but had no experi-
ence of internal management. Donnan’s
position was the reverse.
Solution: Donnan becomes principal
assistant, cleansing department; Soner-
son becomes senior cleansing-supervisor.
Both posts are new and each carries a
salary of £1566. The old post of assistant-
superintendent rated £2020, so the Lord
Mayor’s bright idea will cost the rate-
payers £lll2 a year (plus payroll-tax and
superannuation contributions on that
amount).
According to Lord Mayor Jensen’s
calculations this is not so ; he claims the
council will actually save on the deal.
Anyone who wants to believe that is
welcome to.
Still, the solution is a brilliant one,
whatever the cost. And the cleansing
department was the obvious one in which
to pioneer the plan for extra staff. If ever
a municipal council needed cleansing it’s
the Sydney City Council.
In Doleful Dumps
Much of Labor’s Federal Budget
criticism consisted of doleful stories of
unemployment and forecasts of more
unemployment, with the charge that the
Government had either caused it or was
favorable to its continuance. It was not
a new charge ; it has been tossed about
in Parliament and on the hustings for
the past eight years ; the “unemployment-
pool” myth was, in fact, the party’s
principal theme-song in the 1949 election-
campaign, and, despite its failure to
impress the electorate, it has never been
abandoned.
The idea, apparently, is that if it is
repeated often enough it will eventually
come true. The hopes of the Evatt-
Ward party rose during the 1952
“recession,” when there was a temporary
rise in unemployment figures which
they thought might continue long enough
to carry them back to office.
It didji't continue. Despite the influx
of hundreds of thousands of migrants,
no real unemployment - problem
developed during the succeeding four or
five years. But the chorus didn’t give up
hope. They kept humming the theme-
song, just in case. Early this year a new
wave of optimism swept through the
ranks of Labor when for several months
in succession the official figures showed
a rise in the number of people unem-
ployed. In comparison with even the
most prosperous pre-war years the actual
numbers out of work were very small
indeed; the disturbing thing was that
the trend was steadily upward. This was
the cue for the piping trebles and sturdy
basses of Federal Labor to dose them-
selves with throat-lozenges in prepara-
tion for bursting into full song on their
favorite theme in the course of the
Budget debate.
Unfortunately for the choristers,
something went wrong with the score.
Any sting the tuneful attack might have
had was nullified by the fact that the
Commonwealth Employment Service
figures for August were released at about
the same time and showed, for the second
month in succession, a slight improve-
ment in employment.
The recovery was not great —the
number of persons receiving unemploy-
ment-benefit dropped from 20,291 to
20.175 during the month, and the number
registered for jobs from 53,108 to 51,262
—but the essential point is that it was
an improvement and that it followed a
similar improvement in July. In the light
of this trend —and in winter, at that —
it was hard for even the Wards and
Camerons to sound as if they believed
themselves.
No doubt the chorus will continue its
theme-song, for it knows no other. But
it must be very discouraging to have to
keep on singing doleful forecasts of
increasing unemployment when unem-
ployment refuses to increase.
Burdekin the Seventh State?
The third convention of the New State
for North Queensland Movement met at
Charters Towers last week in an atmos-
phere much more hopeful than on
previous occasions, though many of the
150 delegates seemed a little bewildered
at the sudden change of wind. They
have for years been talking New State
in terms of a faraway ideal; now they
have been abruptly confronted with the
proposition that if they want autonomy
the next move is up to them. While
Labor was in office there was no chance
of separation, but the leaders of the
C.P. and Liberals have both stated in
the past that they would give favorable
consideration to a request for a referen-
dum if it was presented with sufficient
backing.
This promise was reiterated at the
Charters Towers meeting when T. A.
Gilmore, M.L.A. for Tablelands, read
a message from Premier Nicklin giving
an assurance that if his Government was
petitioned by North Queensland (or by
Central Queensland, where there is also
a separatist movement) for a referendum
it would grant one.
U. R. Ellis, author of New Australian
States and a member of the Constituent
Assembly of New England, told the con-
vention that their most urgent task was
to adopt a petition “couched in terms
which conform to the traditions of
Parliamentary procedure” and to secure
for it as many signatures as possible in
order to demonstrate “without a shadow
of doubt that the people of the North
positively wish to exercise the rights of
self-government.”
From a batch of nine names—•
Burdekin, Carpentaria, Cook, Endeavour,
Kennedy, Macrossan, Northland, North
Queensland and York —the convention
chose the first. The proposed State of
Burdekin would include all Queensland
north of a line drawn from Cape
Palmerston (just below Mackay) westward
to the Northern Territory border. It
would comprise 272,000 square miles
with a population of about a quarter of
a million.
Forming a new State entails much
more than presenting a petition and
choosing a name. The sponsors of the
movement will have to demonstrate
that their proposed State would be
economically viable and politically
stable. They will have to convince a
majority of people in the area that their
proposals will benefit the North. They
may have to convince the people of the
rest of Queensland that the whole State
will benefit by subdivision. Their cam-
paign to do all this will be watched with
interest throughout Australia.
1.L.0. and Lib.-C.P.
|From Canberra]
It was ironical that the Menzies-Fadden
Government, elected on a vigorous and
healthy policy of anti-Communism,
should have been attacked last week for
having aided and abetted the election of
Communists to certain offices in the Inter-
national Labor Organisation.
The Associated Chambers of Manu-
factures claimed that despite entreaty
from the Australian employers’
representatives at 1.L.0., the Govern-
ment voted with the majority in favor
of granting the Communists deputy-
membership of three technical committees
of the organisation.
The A.C.M. pointed out that the 1.L.0.
is a tripartite body consisting of two
Government-, one employer- and one
worker-delegates from each of its 77
members.
The problem now causing the heart-
burning in Canberra first arose in 1954,
when Russia joined 1.L.0.
The employers in the free world


claimed that the so-called “employer”-
delegates from Russia and its satellite
countries were not free but mere puppets
of their Government, who must act and
vote as they were told.
The free employers have consistently
refused to accept on the technical com-
mittees the delegates who carry the label
“employer” from the Iron Curtain
countries.
Each time this occurs the Russians
appeal to the plenary session of the
conference to be placed on the technical
committees.
It was at this stage at the recent 1.L.0.
conference that the Government delegates
—Labor Minister Harold Holt and two
officials of the Department of Labor and
National Service —and the manufacturers
came to the parting of the ways, and the
Government delegates voted for the
admission to membership of the three
committees of the Communists.
What is angering the Australian manu-
facturers so much is that they believe
the 1.L.0. is drifting away from its
original concept and becoming political,
and that the Australian Government’s
support for the Communist countries is
contributing to this “unhappy situation,”
and the Communists are not slow to
exploit it to the full.
The Opposition in the House wasn’t
slow to seize on the point, either, and was
in the delicious political position of being
able to attack the Menzies-Fadden
Government for leaning towards
Communists!
Harold Holt, who had the distinction
of being elected chairman of the 1.L.0.
at the recent session, and other Ministers
were clearly embarrassed.
"Count Me Out"
[By “Ek Dum”]
Germany was battered in World War I.
It was such an invalid when the depres-
sion came that the body which was to
watch its behavior and keep it disarmed
gave up the ghost because it looked as if
it were likely to break-up under economic
stresses. That it could rearm seemed
fantastic.
In four or five years it was the focus
of European thought and fear;
in seven, every great nation round it was
forced to build up its defences in a hurry ;
in a decade it had put itself on such a
basis that it took the world nearly six
years to subdue it in the field.
It finished World War II a heap of
battered ruins without a Government, its
great cities rubble, its industry beaten
into the ground, and what factories it
had in being were mostly in Western
hands or were carted off to the Russian
zone. Those of its main leaders who had
not suicided or fled were hanged or sent
to the prison of Spandau. It appeared
to have ceased to be a nation.
All its agricultural area of the East,
with 17 million of its nationals, were in
Russian hands, including most of Berlin.
The Russian zone reached, and still
reaches, to the Elbe. Western Berlin is
only an island. The Ruhr, in 1945, was
mostly like Hiroshima. Shipping, com-
munications, industry, port facilities, ship-
building facilities, capital had all gone.
"CUCKOO! CUCKOO!"
West Germany, too, was cut up into
zones. The only government was carried
out by the heads of conquering armies.
Today, Western Germany is the
strongest and most prosperous country in
Europe ; next to the United States and
the U.K., the most stable and powerful
industrially in the world, Russia not
excepted. It has achieved this under the
political leadership of an indestructible
old man, who was Lord Mayor of Cologne
as far back as 1917 and who was one of
the nuts which Hitler failed to crack.
Much of its new prosperity has arisen
from the fact that it has industrial know-
how and coal, a central position and none
of the huge defence burdens which have
weighed down other Western nations.
The whole world would have to come
to its aid if it were attacked by the one
nation likely to attack it. And it does
not care how long this condition of affairs
continues.
Nothing in the politics of the modern
world has formed such an astonishing
spectacle as the German elections just
over. One would expect in a country
whose natural eastern half and national
capital is in foreign hands that external
affairs would comprise the great issues.
In a nation of great defence potential and
national pride (Deutschland ueber alles )
one would have expected passionate
patriotic aspirations to be aired.
There has been nothing of that sort.
The foreign-affairs election platform of
all large parties in Western Germany
could be summed-up in the terse phrase
“Ohne mich ” —“Count me out.” The
outlook was wholly domestic.
Germany has dragged hard on the leash
of the Nato agreement—and the French
especially seem to like it that way.
German taxpayers are not anxious to
see a position change under which a
country carrying a population of about
51 million and in the very centre of the
European whirlpool with at least 40
Russian divisions within a few hours of
its borders last year spent on defence only
a little more than half the amount
budgeted for in Australia —the year before
that it was only £2,000,000 Australian.
It is quite content for the United States
to make its foreign policy in the most
astonishing way, because it feels that so
long as the U.S. makes it, the U.S. will
have to defend it and pay for it. It is
probably this which has affected in some
degree the outlook of other European
countries.
The sacred thing in Germany is the
economy. Its real dictator is the
Economics Minister, Professor Ehrhardt.
Everything is subordinated to develop-
ment of exports. The trade-unions are as
captive to the Government as those of
Russia. The Government has not allowed
them to politicalise themselves and has
met no real resistance. One might have
expected them at the'election to support
the Social Democrats, who were the Gov-
ernment’s main opposition, but even Dr.
Evatt’s admiration for the breed could not
tempt them to endorse that hopeful party
—partly because of Dr. Adenauer’s atti-
tude and partly because it has a smell of
the Communist underground about it.
Thus, in a country still with depressed
living-standards in strong contrast to the
growth of industry and export-markets
and booming foreign reserves in dollars
and gold, there were no issues at the
elections between master and trade-union.
It was difficult indeed, watching the
German press, to decide what the real
issues were—or if there were any. Social
Democrats seemed to be fighting on a
platform consisting of the words, “Have
a Beer.”
The electors apparently agreed. The
Christian Democrats, with 50 p.c. of the
votes, came back with 270 seats —15 more
than in the old House, giving them an
absolute majority of 42. The Social
Democrats (31.8 p.c.) hold 169, as against
143 at the last poll. The Free Democrats
gained five seats —total 4L The only
largish party which really lost ground
was the German party, whose 33 seats
was halved. The German Reich party
polled only 1 per cent.
The new German seems to know when
he is well-off.

“Mugga Way”: When the Duke of

dedicate the Shrine of Remembrance in
Melbourne innumerable photographs of
the elaborate ceremony were taken and
published. Yet when a pending publica-

performing the dedication it was dis-
covered that neither the trustees of the
Shrine nor the State executive of the
R.S.L. had one. Remarkable that the
trustees, at least, should not preserve at
least one such record of this major
occasion in the history of the £250,000

happened to come out. She gave one
terrified squawk and flew inside. I
casually followed, took the phone out of
her shaking hand and, bidding her not
to assume the worst on such little evidence,
led her to the kitchen. Opening the after-
noon paper I had brought home I
pointed to the photo of a statuette of a
pin-headed, faceless, handless, sexless
nude figure. “That,” I said, “is one of
six ‘Oscars’ which the Federated Cloth-
ing Trades Council is to present to the six

and suck up some coffee,” he said.
“Coffee and buttered toast. ’Course, I
have me tea when I get home. This coffee
is just a racket, but I gotta do it. All the
fellers meet there every night. We reckon
to get a free cup at Christmas-or some-
time.” He pulled a black revolver out of
his pocket, pulled the trigger and picked
out a cigarette. He flicked the lighter in
the nozzle, then decided against it. “No.
I’ll split it in half and put the tobacco in

“The consideration that the kangaroo and

“Of all the silly things to do!”
The Emu told the Kangaroo.
“To compromise our lucky charms
Upon the Australian coat-of-arms
With what? A Pomeranian Rampant?
A Miner or a Fettler Campant?”
“1 rather think they’ve come to deem
you,’’
The ’Roo responded to the Emu,
“Of little value to their shops,
While l — l’m always on the hops.
They say they want to symbolise
Not only farms, but factories —
A hammer, maybe, and a sickle . . .!”
This proposition seemed to tickle
The stately symbols of the masses ;
They roared with laughter like jackasses,
With tail and feet they thumped the
ground,
With paws and wings they clapped and
clowned;
Then, all at once they seemed to be
Aware of loss of dignity
And soberly resumed their job,
And when I saw my last two-bob
They looked more likely, and more fit
Than I was, to hang on to it.

/"''AN anybody tell me what race of
people speak lban? My literary
agents in London have advised me that
an edition of my Meeting Pool is in the
offing “in a language called lban.”
According to my dictionary one of the
chief dialects of the Philippines is lbanag,
spoken principally in Northern Luzon
by the Cagayanes. I have never met a
Cagayane, but I often met the Ibans. They
are a race of Dyaks who took to the
water to escape the attentions of their
headhunting . neighbors, and they
frequented the south-west coast of Borneo
in their long pakarangans with double
outriggers and piratical-looking lateen-
sails, on which craft they lived, with wives,
children, pigs and poultry, doing nothing
more piratical than fishing and gathering
trepang. They are a gentle people, but
I can’t imagine that they have acquired
such a thirst for culture as to yearn to
read a book of mine. Whoever speak it,
I am proud to know that I am probably
the first Australian author to be trans-
lated into lban. — M. G. Skipper.

“Chumley”: When the A.B.C. (Sydney)
referred to two South Australian towns
as “Yanton Abbey” and “Wye Rulla,” it
was some seconds before I realised that
the announcer meant Yantanabie and
Wirrulla, on S.A.’s far south coast.
There is a gazetteer'of Australian place-
names complete with phonetic pronuncia-
tions, but the A.B.C. doesn’t appear to
make use of it. I expect that the home-
town pronunciation of any place-name
must be regarded as the correct one. If the
Yanks call Arkansas “Arkansaw,” the
English Berkshire “Barkshire,” and most
Croweaters their capital city “Adlid,”
there can’t be any fixed rule. The biggest
fluff I’ve heard was by an announcer
attempting “moiety” ; in the end he simply
gave it up.

crook cheques. As they were mainly for
small amounts he considered the advertise-
ment was worth the loss. He made a
gallery of the cheques that had bounced,
pasting them up on the wall of the bar-
parlor, some dated years before. Then
one of three visitors drinking in the
parlor and looking over the exhibits
noticed that one of the unpaid cheques
was his own. He was a man who had


gone bankrupt, got an honorable dis-
charge and subsequently made good—the
publican received a letter from a solici-
tor in which libel was mentioned. The
case was settled out of court for a nice
little sum, and the exhibition of com-
mercial art was hurriedly closed to the

Spanish from waterless welljn the court-
yard to wrought-iron lantern on the
synthetic adobe walls. Home architecture
followed the lead. The owner of a
Spanish-type home was as modern as the
minute and proud indeed of it. Today,
such is the fickleness of architectural
fashion, the skillion- or butterfly-roofed

Antarctica wasn’t a patch on the frigidity

“All great portraits evoke a psychological

Dobell’s portrait of Dame Mary Gilmore.
It must now be gravely doubted
That when Cromwell the Protector
“Sat,” he had, to him who wielded
brush and maul,
Thus incontinently spouted
In the harsh tone of a Hector:
“I must insist you paint me, warts and
all!”
It% more probable, we fear, he
Took a dictionary with him
In the interests of obtuse grandilo-
quence.
Thus to shape his anxious query
With an ear to lilt and rhythm:
“Will it evoke psychological ambience?”
When in Gallery you are gazing
Round and come upon the picture
Of a very shapely* beautiful young gal,
Encomiums don’t be phrasing.
The correct thing is to resist your
Charm-awareness. But be analytical.
Not just touching on the beauty
Of her lips, or the suggestion
That her eyes are mirrors of her
innocence—
No! Your plain aesthetic duty
Is to ask yourself this question:
Does it evoke psychological ambience?
It might well evoke some laughter
Were some bloodstock owner willing
(As a gesture to the Fourth Estate) to
name
His promising gelding after
Such a phrase. I’d risk a shilling
Or two each way, in plunging on the
t same.
Thoughts are better for the masking,
P’r aps, than instant recognition; ,
Yet it’s possible I may be much more
dense
Than I thought. Well, then, I’m asking
For a clear, plain definition:
What the hell IS “psychological
ambience”? $

TOM MALONE
Old Tommy rode a chestnut horse
The days I knew him best,
And he knew as a lover knows his love
The stock-routes of the west.
He’d knuckly hands and blue, blue
eyes,
The short-stepped horseman’s stride,
And horsemen knowing him would say,
“Ah, Tom Malone could ride.”
And squatted on his spurless heels,
He’d tell of trips he’d made,
The bridle-rein looped on his arm,
His dogs in the horse’s shade.
Three kelpie dogs; sometimes the old
Grey-muzzled bitch would poke
Her head beneath his crooked arm—
He’d pull her ears and stroke
Her ribs; unknowing, fondling both,
The action worn with years,
His eyes caressing horizons;
His hands, the bitch’s ears.
And when he spoke of them, the creeks
And rivers flowed and moved
As sweet and cool amongst his words
As over the land he loved;
And flowers from forgotten springs
Would bloom for him again,
The everlastings’ rustling drifts
Snowing the endless plain;
And home was in his bridle-hand.
Wherever his campfire shone,
A wandering camp of bells and stars
Was home to Tom Malone.
Oh, Tommy, now I’ve yarded you
Within a web of rhyme,
Take good hold of your chestnut horse
And crack your whip at time.

He accepted the decision. Apart from the

wants often isn’t practical politics. The
practical politics in the decision were that
some master-retailers alleged the change

Liberal backbenchers in swinging seats

“Hay Diet”: There’s keen competition

Haylen, who won the honor recently,

criticised in caucus for failing to make

the Budget, but after. beginning with an
assertion (right off the beam) that the
P.M. hadn’t dealt with the Budget he
proceeded to ignore it himself, and ride
his hobby-horse about the interlocking
“octopus companies.” The Menzies case
was a reasoned one, even if it had omis-
sions which Labor wouldn’t notice or
mention, but Ward’s vituperation was so
commonplace that it could have been
picked up out of almost any Hansard in
the last decade. It’s about time this

According to Melbourne sources, the
most piquant debate at the A.C.T.U.
congress in Sydney will be on the efforts
of the militants to back-pedal on com-
pulsory-unionism and get it replaced by
preference-to-unionists, an issue made
thornier still by the fact that it is held
in Sydney, capital of a State which has
adopted compulsory-unionism.
The changed attitude of the militants
is due to the painful discovery that com-
pulsory-unionism has brought into the fold
some uncompromising Right-wingers who
not only vote the wrong way at union-
election time, but also attend union
meetings to hear what’s going on and
vote the wrong way there, too.

. S.A. Labor wasn’t quite so gentle in its
treatment of Cyril Chambers as the
Westralian branch was with H. V. John-
son, who had also said things about the
Doc. that no good Labor man can say
and live. Johnson wasn’t expelled, but
was merely told that his endorsement
would not be renewed next election. As
the member for Kalgoorlie had already
stated that he didn’t intend to stand again,
the verdict was a kind of kid-glove smack.
The Adelaide man’s case wasn’t so simple.
He hadn’t said anything about retiring.
The executive decided it was a case for
the axe.
Chambers will now sit on the cross-
benches as an Independent Labor member,
while Johnson continues as a party
member (though with the' black spot on
him). Chambers hasn’t decided yet
whether he’ll run for Adelaide again as an
Independent, but he says that whoever
gets the Labor nomination will find a
hard fight ahead of him. In the mean-
time he has the consolation of knowing
that Johnson isn’t by any means the only
man in caucus who thinks the same as he
does about the Doc.
In Sydney on Sunday Father Adalbert

Snippet from “Hansard” report of
Menzies’s speech in the Budget debate:
Mr. Clyde Cameron (.Labor, Hindmarsh,

Mr. Menzies: Is that so? Well, after
the Lord Mayor’s procession—
The Chairman: Order! There is too

From political events in Newcastle it
can be deduced that the great liberal
who leads the A.L.P. in the Federal Parlia-
ment cannot fight a plebiscite in most
Labor electorates, much less an election
in the one he has held for 17 years. So
soon as it was evident that there would
be a contest for the nomination in New-
castle the aspirant back-pedalled into
Hunter. There’ll be no plebiscite in
Hunter if he graciously decides that he
can win it. Even though the sitting mem-
ber was so friendly with the Communists
during the war that he used to sign his
telegrams to them “Old Rowley,” a
correspondent of Molotov would have
priority with the local A.L.P. —if it can
be called an A.L.P.

After discussing the affair of Aider-
man A. J. Cahill and his fine the N. S.
Wales executive of the A.L.P. expelled
him from the party. This was right and
proper though it had by no means been a
foregone conclusion that the executive
would take the action.
Cahill’s expulsion reduces Labor repre-
sentation on the 21-man Sydney City
Council to 10, thus losing its absolute

majority. However, on most questions
Labor can rely on the'votes of Communist
member Wright and probably also of
that of the expelled alderman.
Alderman Cahill’s position on the
council is rather anomalous. He has
been convicted of what amounts to
corruption, yet he remains a member of
what should be an incorruptible body and
according to the Minister for Local Gov-
ernment nothing can be done to remove
him. Council may not be able to demand
his resignation, but hi# fellow-aldermen
can at least remove him from elective
committees. If they don’t do so they
will be condoning the action for which he
was convicted.

Another Liberal has resigned from the

Queensland Treasurer Hiley will intro-
duce his Budget on Thursday—the first
presented by a Liberal Treasurer since
1931. The debate which follows will be
a novel one for both sides of the House,

proposed expenditure and C.P.-Liberal

consecutive Budget debates argument
went the other way.

Sydney’s little war over late-shopping
continues. On Friday night more than
30 shops remained open after the statu-
tory closing-hour—most of them in the
Imperial Arcade, and at Caringbah, a
growing suburb near Cronulla. Inspectors
booked most of them, and Minister for
Labor and Industry J. J. Maloney says
they’ll all be prosecuted. Moreover, he’s
talking of increasing the penalties for
after-hours trading.

Senator Spooner, Minister for National
Development, phoned S.A. Premier Play-
ford offering to go to Adelaide to discuss
S.A. grievances against the Snowy waters
agreement. Playford told his Parliament
he had rejected the offer.
I asked him quite bluntly what there was
to discuss, as the water had been signed
away by the Commonwealth on Wednes-
day. I had to tell Senator Spooner that I
thought the time for discussion was before
the signing.
Playford was repeatedly rebuffed dur-
ing the negotiations between the Com-
monwealth, Victoria and New South
Wales when he asked to be shown a copy
of the agreement. He now intends to
start legal proceedings on the grounds
that the pact is an infringement of the
Murray Waters Agreement.


PERSONAL ITEMS
When Donald Mackinnon goes to
Brazil as Australian Minister in succes-
sion of C. V. Kellway he will start off
with two advantages Australian envoys
to South America don’t usually have —
he knows that jpart of the world and he
can speak Spanish and Portuguese. He
lived in Argentina from 1929-46, is an
expert on the meat industry and has been
a member of the advisory council of the
C.5.1.R.0. since 1952. He’s a brother of
E. D. Mackinnon, M.H.R. for Coranga-
mite, and was president of the Victorian
Liberals in 1949-50. Educated at Geelong
Grammar and Melbourne and Oxford
Universities, he served in King Edward’s
Horse, 1914-18, and was wounded at

Sydney, which has its own native
troubadors —who don’t sing, but just sing-
out “Fez please!”—has been enjoying the
art of a troubador of another variety.
William Clauson calls himself a “balla-
deer,” and instead of moving leisurely on
horseback from castle to castle, as did
the medieval poet-musicians, he whizzes
by DC7 and Constellation from country
to country.
Bom in the U.S. of Swedish parents,
Clauson was seized early in life with a
yen for things musical, first studying the
fiddle; then, while at high-school, he
took up the guitar, learning it from the
master Jose Barroso. He had voice-
training from Victor Fuchs ; and, thus
equipped, he hopped into the movies,
appearing in films with James Stewart
and Abbott and Costello. Army service
BALLADEER
followed, and when he tossed aside the
tin-hat he plumped for the life of the
troubador. Since then he has roamed
the two Americas, the British Isles and
the Continent, and the Far East —in all
parts keeping an eye peeled for folksongs
to add to his repertoire. He sings all
these folksongs in the language of their
origin; and he is a virtuoso on his
guitar.
Clauson, who under the A.B.C. banner
is doing a high-speed 13-weeks tour of
the Commonwealth entailing 43
appearances, has a light tenor of admirable
timbre ; he is a “natural” at song-making;
and backs up both with a personality
which fairly leaps across to the audience.

ball, and kicked plenty of goals as a nifty

lan Connell, president of the Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce, isn’t sure whether
he’s a Scot or an Australian, a wholesaler
or a retailer. Bom in Melbourne, he was

Connell and Co., Ltd., wholesale grocers.
WHOLES A LE-RETAILER
Connell’s grandfather founded the busi-
ness in Melbourne in 1853, opened a
London branch in 1866 and spread to
N. S. Wales by buying the business of
Cramsie, Bowden and Archer in 1878.
lan Connell returned to Australia in
1936 and became sole managing-director
of Connell’s the following year; chair-
man in 1941. In 1946 the company
acquired the S. E. Dickins chain of
retail-grocery stores —pioneers in Victoria
of the serve-yourself system—and since
then has shifted its emphasis to the retail-
trade, although it still operates as a whole-
saler in N. S. Wales. Connell claims
that the self-serve shops, by making the
grocery-trade more keenly competitive,
have kept a brake on household-bills in
a period of rising costs and prices.

In Melbourne to begin a series of
lectures arranged by the University exten-

Chancellors of some Australian uni-
versities is Dr. Harold Willis Dodds, just-
retired president of Princeton University,
New Jersey, authority on political science,
and one of those Americans deeply con-
cerned with the higher education of young
people. In view of the alarm expressed
by eminent academic Australians at the
loss to early, profitable employment of
brilliant or promising students, Dr.
Dodds’s visit is probably not coincidental.
From Melbourne, Dr. Dodds, who was
president of Princeton for 24 years, will
go to Canberra and Sydney to lecture and
talk privately with those concerned with
Australian education.

Albany Bell, dead in Perth at 86, will
be remembered by an older generation
as the owner of the largest chain of tea-
rooms in Perth, with branches in Kal-
goorlie and Boulder. He migrated from
South Australia in 1887 and set-up a
confectionery-manufacturing business in


1894. The original factory in Dargan
Street still stands, though it has been used
for many purposes since he vacated it.
Shortly before World War I he built a
modern factory at Mount Lawley, and
carried on his confectionery- and baking-
business there till about 1924. During
World War I he was in England and
France with the Y.M.C.A., of which he
was made a life-member. After retiring
Bell bought a property at Roelands, about
100 miles from Perth, and helped
establish a mission-station for half-castes
at Seven Hills. In recent years his chief
interest was his 10-acre citrus-orchard at
Roelands, which he ran for the sole
purpose of supplying children, both white
and aboriginal, in missions and institu-
tions ; he gave away about 2000 cases of
oranges, lemons and grapefruit every
year. The Silver Chain district Nursing
Association was another of the many
charitable organisations with which he
was associated.

New Presbyterian Moderator-General
the Right Rev. -David Flockhart was
sketched by Ovenden at his induction at
the Assembly Hall, Melbourne. Many
churchmen expect the quiet, persuasive
lecturer at St. Andrew’s College, Sydney,
to further during his term the long-time
prayer for union with the Methodists and
Congregationalists in Australia. In his
induction address he issued an open
MODERATOR-GENERAL
invitation for such a move —a departure
from previous delicate overtures. The
Moderator-General’s 38 years’ service
with the Church includes 30 as resident
minister at Wahroonga, Sydney, chaplain
of Knox Grammar and a war-time
chaplain to the 2/21 Battalion. He is
chairman of the N. S. Wales Education

With the retirement of Eric Furnival
Griffin from the boards of--Oil Search,
Ltd., and Oriomo Oil, Ltd., the oil-game
in Australia has lost a respected and
colorful figure, and the press will miss a
ready and always-reliable spokesman for
those enterprises. At a time when Aus-
tralian oil-ventures were considered sus-
pect in Britain, he was instrumental in
arranging the existing partnership between
Oil Search—of which he was managing-
director and chairman —and Vacuum
Oil and BP. Since that partnership was
formed, Oil Search has been able to retain
its 10 per cent, interest in the partner-
ship through what can only be des-
cribed as very difficult times. During his
20 years of office, the issued capital of
Oil Search has increased more than twelve-
fold to nearly £3jr million.

Sir Leslie Munro, newly-elected Presi-

been New Zealand’s Ambassador in
Washington and permanent delegate to
the U.N. since 1952. Before turning
diplomat he had been a lawyer and a
journalist both of which professions
call for a certain amount of diplomacy.
He lectured constitutional law and
Roman law at Auckland University
College for many years and was Dean of
the Faculty of Law and a member of the
N.Z. Law Society before becoming
associate-editor of the “New Zealand
Herald” in 1941. He edited the “Herald”
from 1942 until Prime Minister Holland

Few men could be better qualified to
present the needs of his State to intend-
ing British migrants and the general
public of the U.K. than 59-year-old
Edward Knight Hoar, newly appointed
Agent-General for Westralia in England.
Born at Luton (Bedfordshire), he joined
the Royal Engineers at 16 and served in
France and Palestine. Lighthorsemen
from W.A., whom he met in hospital,
gave him the . impulse to migrate to
Westralia. Arriving in 1922, he took a
job as a mill-hand in the State sawmills,
went from that into the Lands Depart-
ment, but returned to timber, and for 11
years was on the executive of the Timber
Workers’ Union, of which he was for
some time vice-president. He entered the
Legislative Assembly as member for
Nelson (now Warren), and has been
Minister for Lands and Agriculture since
1953. He has proved himself an earnest
and painstaking administrator, but
perhaps his best qualification for the
new post is that expressed in his own
words: “I’ll be a fair example for
English people of what can happen in
Western Australia.”

M. F. Dixon: Few newspapermen have
received so many and varied tributes as
veteran country editor Archie Rodgers,
who has vacated the editorial chair of the
Nepean (N.S.W.) “Times” after 38 years.
Archie, long known as the “thirteenth

for the regularity of his attendance and
the faithfulness of his reports, was the
subject of a minute by Mayor Fowler
recording the council’s “sincere affection
and appreciation” of his personal qualities

Exhibition to be held in Adelaide next

and the integrity of his work, and the
council voted £lO towards a fund the
citizens of Penrith and district are organis-
ing. Some of the money will probably go
towards buying Archie a new hat; for it
is reckoned that he has worn-out three
times as many ha,t.s as any other man in
the district through their being used as a
ballot-box at the annual election of officers
of organisations he has regularly attended.
Archie Rodgers served in World War I,
joining the Nepean “Times” soon after
discharge in 1919. The only country
journalist I can recall with a longer record
is W. H. Willard, who was on the editorial
staff of the Maitland “Daily Mercury” for
more than 50 years.

“A 1 Pal”: After a pretty fair issue of
rain, the boss and his offsider set off up
the black-soil stock-route per sulky and
blue sulky-mare (a stubborn jib when the
mood took her) to collect mail and stores ;
this being the only way possible at the
"I told YOU to stay home!”
time—the combination of water and black
soil being what it is. The going got tough
and the inevitable happened—the mare
jibbed. Gathering the reins together the
boss began laying on the leather till the
mare changed her mind—suddenly.
“Hold on to her! ” yelled his mate, which
he did —over the splashboard, and for
about 40yds. through the gluey mud and
slush, till his 16st., plus copious quantities
of said goo adhering to and inside his
shirt and trousers, finally anchored her —•
the sulky being still where he’d left it.
As far as I know there are still a couple
of pieces of comparatively good harness
up there for anyone who can find ’em.
“Q. Ree”: A seaman fell overboard in
the dark from a ship bound for Fiji.
Nobody noticed he had gone until about
four hours later. The ship steamed back

There had been too much swell for him to
float and he had trod water for nine
hours until picked up. First thing on
reaching Fiji he went for a swim.

“West End”: One of the attractions of
Bullen Bros.’ circus when it was lately
in Brisbane was the team of six large
geese which, when not in the big-top
doing their act, strolled about Musgrave
Park as if they owned the place. They
were frightened of nothing—not even
small boys with sticks or the pack of
town dogs which frequented the park,
and which occasionally made the mistake
of advancing too close to the feeding
geese, whereupon the gander, assisted
by his harem, soon
put them to flight.
The geese made no
attempt to leave the
park, and they
quidkly got into top
gear when the cook
banged the big dish

circus-hands’ meal-
time, the birds lining-
up with the rest for
their handout. You
could have no doubt
that those birds
really knew they
were a part of the

SHIRALEE
A SHIRALEE is primarily a swag, and
Webster’s Dictionary gives this
meaning, adding “Australian slang.”
My own research on the matter
amplifies this: a shiralee was a particular
type of swag, one shaped like a leg of
mutton, carried over the shoulder by
a strap or rope, which usually balanced
some other load, probably a tucker-bag,
on the chest.
I have two pictures from the ’sixties
which show this plainly, one of Bendigo
miners on the way to the fields, the other
of Gabriel’s Gully miners (Otago, N.Z.)
also on the way to the diggings. In each
case the captions say these, men are
carrying shiralees. One man is carrying
as well the ordinary dtum-type swag.
In another picture I possess, of
American miners en route to Pike’s Peak
(1854), several men carry shiralees as well
as other baggage, pudding-swags, shovels,
picks, etc. This type of swag, then (no
matter what its name was), was known in
Colorado, and could have been brought
here by the American goldminers present
in great numbers on our own and N.Z.
fields.
Various guesses have been made at the
origin of the word. There seems reason
to believe it is Irish in derivation. It
sounds Irish. On the other hand it could
well be ai corruption of some foreign
phrase. If the swag originally contained
only bedding the two last syllables could
perhaps be a lit or au lit.
I have used this beautiful and
mysterious word in its intrinsic meaning,
a swag, a burden, the swagman’s load,
which in Macauley’s case was his
unwanted companion, his child.

to be lowered when a mourner exclaimed:
“Wait! Don’t plant him yet! That’s
likely-looking wash down there. Got
your dish handy, Jack?” In no time the
grave was overfull of miners and their
tools. They struck good color right away,
and excitement was rising high when
someone asked, “What about Joe?” “Eh?
Oh, yes, Joe. Can’t plant him anywhere
about here, he’d be dug up inside a week.
Some of you blokes take your tools up
the hill, where there’s no chance of strik-
ing gold. Let us know when you’ve got
a hole dug, and we’ll come and plant him
there. Right? Here, gimme that dish.”
So Joe rested in peace and oblivion on
the hill, and his first grave turned out a
bonanza, which was named, not after him
but, far less aptly, after the Queen of
Sheba.

“Kros”: Stratospheric rocket-tests held
in August by the U.S. Air Force research-
centre at Cambridge (U.S.) confirmed the
existence of a vast reservoir of solar
energy chemically stored way up above
the earth. The U.S. scientists concerned
in the experiments believe that a rocket-
engine could be invented which could
utilise as fuel this powered sunlight.
Provided the materials that would be
needed for such an engine would not be
too v rare and difficult to obtain, the
harnessing of this solar energy should
certainly result in very cheap rocket-
propulsion. Whether this will be for the
good or bad of mankind would make a
fair sort of campfire argument.

“Pegasus”: After my first day’s work
as a drover’s offsider I settled down near
the campfire for a read. Noting that the
drover and the cook apparently had noth-

“I know I’m mad,” he declared, “but I’m
not that far gone yet that I’ve started
to read books!” The drover had the
same sentiments. Presently they settled

his wrist-watch under Bung’s conk and

“A.E.P.”: Those triple-barrelled guns
(B. 21/8/’57) were common in Germany
50 years ago. I bought one when going
to the Congo in 1910. It was a hammer-
less gun, two 16-bore shot-barrels on top
and a rifle-barrel tucked in below;
barrels all 28iin. long, weight about
81b.; two triggers only, the rifle being
cocked by pressing the front trigger for-
ward, and carried this way you were
ready with either a rifle-bullet or a shot-
cartridge. The rifle-cartridge was similar
to a .303, but more powerful, being 3f5
(Bmm.). I shot a lot of game with it, but
it had the disadvantage of a single-shot
rifle —time lost in reloading. I had one
■“occasion to be thankful for its multi-
purpose qualities. Walking through high
grass I heard a rustling and hissing, and
a black-mamba’s head reared up nearly
sft. off the ground and faced me at about
syds. Even as I fired I realised it was the
rifle-bullet, but the shot-cartridge
followed before the mamba had time to
move, and the spreading shot settled its
hash! That death-dealer was lift. long.
Incidentally, when I was in Germany two
years ago these guns could still be bought.

“8.A.H.”: In November, 1955, Major
E. T. Towner, V.C., presented to the
Commonwealth twelve healthy young
bottle-trees, which had been carefully
raised oh his property near Longreach
(Q.). The trees were moved to Canberra
by road transport and planted at the
nursery at Westbourne Woods, but,
despite the special scientific care that has
been lavished upon them, only two of the
twelve have survived. The experts say
the local severe winter conditions have
been too much for the trees, and that the
remaining two will die during the coming
season. Although indigenous to North
Queensland, bottle - trees have been
successfully grown in the milder climates
of Melbourne and Adelaide ; but it seems
we won’t be seeing them in Canberra,
where English oaks, elms and beeches ;
North American firs and cottonwoods ;
Mediterranean cypresses, as well as
thousands of Australian eucalypts,
wattles and kurrajongs all flourish.

“Carlyle”: Any member of the Council
know who imported the first hares and
the first sparrows into Australia? An old-
timer of my acquaintance maintains that
Frederick Row, founder of the Melbourne
FALLOW DAY
Now in this winter sun the heart lies
fallow,
Unpossessed by harvest or the seed
Stored in love’s fertile granaries of pain.
There is no poignance in the earth’s green
daggers
Stabbing through lost seasons to the sun.
Not in this still of air and rest of trees
Will the dead stir or the long avenues
Narrow beyond my sight where the blood
moves
Into futurity . . .
This winter bell of day
Hangs silent in all time’s towers, nor peats,
nor tolls.
Still tree, still bird, deep furling of the
rose
Are tapestried, dimension falls away,
And fallow, fallow in the sun, the heart
Incurious as a leaf absorbs the day.

wool-firm of Goldsbrough Row and Co.
(now Goldsbrough Mort), brought both
the first hares and the first sparrows into
Australia in the early 1880’s. My infor-
mant’s father, Michael Sutton, carted them
from Melbourne in his bullock-wagon and
saw them released at Row’s country resi-
dence at Scoresby (Vic.), at the foot of
the Dandenongs. The sparrows escaped
when they were being transferred into a
cage, and Sutton later carted another
consignment.

“Kesem”: Though the late John
Wharton Cunningham (“Long John” to
his war comrades), of Strathmore station
(N.Q.), is reported to have regarded large
snakes with more than ordinary casual-
ness when he was on active service in
New Guinea, his father, A. H. W.
Cunningham, had good reason not to love
the reptiles. Fifty years ago “A.H.W.”
paid an exceedingly high price for a
blood entire from the south. The
valuable animal had not been running
loose on Strathmore more than two weeks
when a snake ended his career. “A.H.W.”
was the man behind the plan which made
the Scartwater property, or its profits,
available to returned soldiers and their
dependants.

“Glen Park”: Touching on recent court
assessments of the value of a wife, at a
little hotel on the South Aus. west coast
early in the piece a man exchanged his
wife for a team of bullocks, and then,
maybe as compliment to his bride, handed
over a gallon of wine as well.

“W.P.T.”: What has happened to all
the birds and animals once common on
the Blue Mountains of N.S.W.? Twenty
years ago you could see hundreds of
parrots of various species, including the
pretty Blue Mountain parrot, right from
Glenbrook to the Jenolan Caves ; down
at the Caves the parrots were so tame
that the drivers of the tourist-coaches fed
them by hand—indeed, watching the
parrots come down to near the Caves
House to be fed was one of the attrac-
tions. Even 10 years ago rock-wallabies
were to be seen near the Grand Arch in
dozens, taking scraps from visitors;
today you see only an occasional one.
It can’t be the bushfires —there have
been bushfires ever since Blaxland,
Lawson and Wentworth crossed the
mountains. There must be some other
reason.
THE GILT DRAGON
A COUPLE of spear-fishermen, opera-
ting from a boat south of Lancelin
Island, about 70 miles north of Fremantle,
sighted something looking like a wreck in
about 20-30 ft. of water, investigated by
means of aqualungs, and spotted what
looked like some old cannon. The
“wreck’s” about 150 ft. long and is
encrusted with coral and weed, indicating
something of its origin and a long rest
in its present position ; and it’s assumed to
be the Gilt Dragon. The finders have
taken the necessary legal steps to safe-
guard their salvage-rights, notified the
“Ah, come on! Don't he such a Jonah!"
Official Receiver of Wrecks, and made an
offer to the Dutch Government.
The story of the Gilt Dragon has been
told a hundred times ; the bare bones are:
A Dutch trading vessel, a valued member
of the Dutch East India Company’s fleet,
she struck a reef somewhere around
latitude 30 (the master’s estimate of his
position placed the spot about 40 mile§.
from where the present wreck lies) and
went down with 118 of her crew of 193.
Of the 75 who survived, seven manned the
only remaining boat —a cockboat —and
sailed or rowed to Batavia, from where
search-parties were sent to pick up the
other survivors. Neither wreck nor party
was sighted.
The Gilt Dragon was carrying eight
boxes of gold and silver coins reputedly
worth 78,600 guilders. Seems to be some
confusion about the value of the coins ;
it has been placed variously between
£lOO,OOO and £2,000,000 ; anyway, it was
sizeable, because the D.E.I. Co., which
wasn’t unduly extravagant, spent a lot of
money and risked several ships chasing
the wreck ; and for decades their skippers
were instructed to keep a lookout for it
and for the castaways.
It has been assumed the treasure was
brought ashore, but the assumption
hasn’t much sound backing. Most
historians don’t mention anything about
the coins except that they were on board ;
but the seven who reached Batavia were
reported to have said that the rest of the
survivors were left in charge of valuables
and merchandise, which suggests that
something was salvaged.
In any case, the ship hung on long
enough for 75 people to reach shore, and
enough provisions were landed to stock a
boat facing a long trip to Batavia and
leave the remaining survivors’ immediate
needs provided for. The country around
there, and tor miles inland, is poor by
anyone’s standards. Even the aborigines
scratched hard for a living there, and at
the end of summer—the wreck occurred
in April—game would have been prac-
tically non-existent. The castaways could
never have provisioned a boat from the
land. Their supplies must have come
from the ship.
Stores drifted ashore? Could be. But
that suggests a fairly complete break-up
of the vessel, in which case this wreck —
still 150 ft. long—isn’t the treasure-ship.
Its finders are confident that it is, and I
hope they’re right; but it could easily
be any one of the scores, possibly hun-
dreds, of old sailing-ships that have gone
aground on our west coast during the
past few hundred years.
Say that it is the Gilt Dragon—what
are the chances of the treasure being
within finding-distance of it now?
Gold is heavy, but gold coins are easily
distributed, and anything left in a sunken
ship, on a western seaboard in stormy
latitudes, with thousands of miles of
open ocean behind it, becomes subjected
to some of the greatest moving forces in
nature.
Three centuries of storms and tides
have pounded and churned those waters,
despite the protecting reefs, and any coins
would have been mixed-up with a lot of
sand. Old coins that could have come
from the Gilt Dragon, or from any other
wrecked ship of that vintage, have been
found at various spots, notably near the
mouth of the Moore River, a few miles
south of where this wreck lies.
My personal view is that, if the Gilt
Dragon’s treasure is ever found, that’s
how it will turn up—in odd coins along
a big stretch of coast.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
ADVANCE ON A WIDER FRONT
-ENCOURAGED by trading
results for 1956-57 that
have been mostly better than
expectations, and by the
“dramatic improvement in the
health of the Australian
economy” remarked upon by
Dr. Coombs, governor of the
central bank, there has been a
strong upward movement in
many stocks on the Australian
’Changes.
This movement is now on a
much broader front than has
been the case for several
months past, when a favored
few of the front-liners were
given almost exclusive atten-
tion. A prickle of interest is
now running almost right,
through the share-lists, but with
particularly striking rises in
good second-liners that had
previously remained dormant
This attention being given to
sound second-liners with results
to exhibit is more easily under-
standable than the bobbysoxer
type of devotion that has been
shown towards any other stock,
usually in the front row, that
was suspected of being about to
make a bonus-issue for any
reason whatsoever.
The Bonus Bellbird
In the long-run an investment
is worth what it will yield, and
yield is the only thing that can
be counted on to sustain its
market-price year in and year
out.
But for the present the
market fashion is to chase
after “top” stocks because they
had strong rises during the
period of investment uncer-
tainty earlier this year. One
rise has attracted another rise,
and the rumor of the bonus-
issue, sometimes as elusive as
the call of the bellbird, has
become the inspiration of
sharemarket bidding from a
well-heeled type of speculator.
The prevailing boom in first-
class stocks, when yields,
present or prospective, appear
to have become a secondary
consideration, is almost as
dangerous for the speculator as
was the recent boom in rutile-
producers. Fashions in share-
market behavior can change
rapidly and unexpectedly, and
a more soberminded share-
market certainly would not find
acceptable so many yields that
are nearer to 3 p.c. than to
4 p.c.
Even the B.H.P. denouement,
where the bonus-issue of two-
for-nine has been the signal of
a reduction in the div.-rate on
new issues of B.H.P shares,
has not shaken the market’s
adoration of “top” stocks. And
the blow to the hopes of
supporters of Henry Jones
shares after the directors’
announcement of a few weeks
ago seems to have been almost
forgotten already. After fall-
ing to around 575., these shares
"Let's get this straight , K.B.—is this a proposal
or a proposition?”
have been bid-up to 635. 6d.
again.
Yield 3.3 p.c.!
No doubt Australia’s market-
leaders are high-quality invest-
ments. But whoever buys
them at present prices should
be well prepared to wait for
benefits. The future of a
stock now yielding only 3.3 p.c.
has been heavily discounted,
and to count on a yield of
5 p.c. will call for an increase
of over 50 p.c. in effective
dividend-rates. And, after all,
5 p.c. is the present bond-rate.
Sound Australian industries
seem to have a bright and
expanding future. But in a
country gravely short of capital
greater emphasis in future will
be placed on profit-retention
than on profit-distribution.
This shortage of capital is no
brief, passing phase. It is
almost as fundamental as the
inflation problem, and is just
as difficult of cure by our own
efforts. Yet the more we are
able to cure it ourselves the
greater will be our attraction to
overseas capital.
To speak more particularly
of the buoyancy in Australian
sharemarkets at present, one
of the heavyweights to move
up swiftly has been Bank of
N.S.W. shares. These twenty-
pounders went above £4l. This
represents a rise of over £ll a
share since the last new issue
of shares.
Illogical
A stock to which attention
was drawn in The Bulletin
when it was at 40s. a few weeks
ago is Kandos Cement. It has
an almost identical equity in
almost identical assets with
Australian Cement, Ltd., which
concern, however, has con-
sistently had a higher market-
value than Kandos. This
consistency is just another of
those illogicalities of share-
market behavior at the present
time.
The Victorian end of the
jointly owned Kandos-Aus-
tralian Cement enterprise is at
present the chief investment-
attraction in the cement
industry. Very shortly capacity
at Geelong will be increased by
about 150,000 tons (to 450,000
tons), and the increase is only
50,000 tons short of the total
capacity at Kandos. But
Kandos Cement has a
50 p.c. equity in the Vic-
torian plant, and it was in
keeping with the afore-
mentioned illogicality that
when Australian Cement £1
shares rose vigorously to
545. 6d. last week Kandos
shares should follow only as
far as 48s. Still, that is Bs.
above the price prevailing
when the scrip was recently
mentioned here, even if it is
still 6s. 6d. short of the Vic-
torian co.’s price.
Apparently the potential of
the jointly - owned cement -
plant is more obvious to Mel-
bourne investors than it is to
those in Sydney.
Spectacular Rises
Among the many spectacular
rises in second-line stocks has
been a lift in Cyclone from
28s. on July 24 to 325. 6d. last
week. Lift in A.R.C. Industries
in the same period was from
295. 3d. to 325.
Repco has risen from
595. 6d. to 635. 3d., Rocla
Pipes from 575. to 655. 6d.
Melbourne “Herald” has moved
up from 245. to 265., H. C.
Sleigh from 455. 3d. to 525. 9d.,
John Fairfax from 20s. 9d. to
235. 9d., Newbold Refractories
from 535. 6d. to 635. 6d.
A front-liner, 1.C.1.A.N.Z.,
has gone up from 495. 6d. to
54 s. 3d. in the two-month
period.
A variety of smaller rises has
spread through the stock-lists,
including some in shares, such
as Morison and Bearby, that
have been almost dormant for
several months.
Odd Disappointments
There have been some dis-
appointments and setbacks, too,
such as in Reichhold and
concerns thought to be
threatened by the trade-agree-
ment with Japan. But, on the
whole, the movement is upward,
based, as previously mentioned,
on trading-results better than
expected in cases where figures
have been published, and on
anticipations of other better
figures when additional
accounts come out; on the
leport of the central bank;
and onThe spread of optimism
form the glamor front-line
stocks to those among the
rank-and-file.
In this rather strange market,
at a time when economic con-
ditions throughout the world
wear an uneven look, and when
Australia’s fortunes have
changed for the better with
“dramatic” suddenness, it is
especially necessary to consider
the income angle, present and
potential, when buying shares.
“Living on the Market”
There is more than a trace of
speculative excitement, typical
of Australian markets from
time to time, running through

the present boom —and it is
undoubtedly a boom —in top-
class shares. And quite a
number of speculators are
prepared to “live on the
market” rather than to base
their expectations on dividend-
cheques.
It has been almost invariably
the case in Australian Stock
Exchange # history, among
mining-shares or industrials,
that “living on the market” is
a precedent to a lot of people,
mostly latecomers,. being left
holding the bag.
The New Bank Rate
T IFTING of its discount-rate
- L/ from 5 p.c. to 7 p.c. by the
Bank of England has followed
a series of shocks to sterling,
the first almost a year ago at
the time of the Suez crisis, the
second less of a shock than a
build-up of pressure in the
shape of increasing trade-
competition from West
Germany and the European
Customs Union countries, and
the third the devaluation of
the franc, which has hit
British trade no less than it
has affected the Australian
flour-export business (which is
plenty).
And while attempting to
cope with all these problems,
Britain has been trying to
promote the Welfare State on
a scale that the national produc-
tion does not justify. There
has also been much grumbling
from the trade-union move-
ment regardless of the grow-
ingly competitive nature of
world trade, and management
has not always been up to the
mark. Australians who have
shown a preference for British
goods have not all had reason
to feel satisfied with the quality
or the service they have received
in recent years.
Behind the question of pro-
ductivity, service received and
quality of management, there
is little doubt that the heavy
burden of British taxation is a
most important consideration
in the matter of all-round
incentives. Many British prices
and charges paid by Australians
are clearly loaded with British
company-tax, and the effect
must extend to other customer-
countries as well.
German and Swedish hand-
tools have collared a large part
of the world’s markets in these
things at the expense of
British manufacturers. And
while the British Government is
at all times hindered by the
Opposition and its backers (the
trade-union movement) in any
attempts to cope with the posi-
tion, the Opposition’s only
answer to the inherent problem
is vituperation and socialisa-
tion!
The present lift in the bank-
rate has been sudden and
extraordinarily steep. It aims
to check the outflow of nervous
money from England and to
attract the investment of short-
term foreign funds in London.
It has no virtues other than
those of emergency, and cannot
be counted on to do other
than provide a breathing-space
for panic to subside and for
economic forces to be
marshalled. While it operates
it imposes a burden on the
export trades through the
higher cost of finance, and adds
to the already inflationary
situation that has been worry-
ing the Treasury for years past.
Britain does not want again
to be forced to devalue the cur-
rency, as in 1949. Australia has
a vital interest in Britain’s
effort.

Learmonth No. 1
[From L.. Owen]
■yuAPET’S trek, once more
. westwards after years of
indecision, is all to the good,
particularly as it is preparing
to drill below the Birdrong
horizon, which, for a long time,
appeared to hold a mesmeric
attraction for the co's. well-
locators.
Learmonth No. 1 well is to
be drilled with a T 32 mobile
rig and it is hoped to attain a
depth of 7500 ft. by employing
“slim-hole” methods. Such a
technique entails the use of
drill-pipe and bits smaller and
lighter than is usual; un-
fortunately, it does not produce
large-diameter cores which are
so valuable in geologically
difficult country.
It is amazing that the pro-
posed westing should have been
delayed nearly four years in
time —and at least four-million
pounds in money—in the test-
ing of this structure.
The new site is stated to be
the result of “new geological
interpretations” which are
derived “from integration of all
the geological and geophysical
work carried out in the area.”
The well is being drilled with
the object of evaluating these
“new” interpretations.
I’m glad that the -co. does
not describe Learmonth 1 as a
developmental well, and I
doubt whether the current
geological interpretation can
correctly be described as new.
For years past I have been
suggesting that Wapet should
“go west,” and much of the
justification for that advice was
derived from what was known
of the Exmouth Gulf geological
history from outcrop data and
from water-wells drilled into
the Birdrong long before
Rough Range 1 was spudded-in.
Learmonth No. 1 location is
about 4| miles nor’-nor’-west
of the airstrip and 1} miles
from the coast. It would thus
be in flat country practically
on the Vlaming head-station
track. That is not so very far
from where I would have
located an exploratory bore,
immediately following the
striking of the Rough Range 1
fossil oil-seep.
Geologically, however, there
would have been important
differences. Nevertheless, it is
comforting to note that, at last,
Wapet appears to have realised
that surface anticlinal axes in
the Exmouth Gulf area have
little significance at depth.
When the young geolo-
gists who left on a “three-
months advanced-training visit
in the United States and
Canada” return to W.A., they
will possess, between them, a
total of almost three man-
years’ experience of producing*
oilfields. This is not much, but
they will have acquired, at least,
the knowledge that Canada —
in its difficult areas—is revert-
ing from geophysics to
geology for final structural
analyses. They will thus be
inclined to treat geophysics as
a useful tool rather than as a
dictatorial master.
Currency Devaluation
[From “W.B.”]
ACCORDING to Geo. F.
Davidson’s reasoning (B.
28/8/’57), the U.S.A. and
Canada should now be
“wallowing in another depres-
sion.”
The £N.Z. was restored to
parity with sterling years ago:
no sign of any depression in
New Zealand. The further
depreciation of the £Aust. in
December, 1949, is widely
recognised as a most costly
blunder. The Swiss franc and
Venezuelan peso set the
standard for stable currency.
Trade Follows the Ships
[From "^Lookout”]
D ECENT developments in
_ trade to the Far East
indicate the extent to which
trade will follow regular
shipping opportunities. One
example is the rapidly expand-
' ing market in Japan for New
Zealand frozen beef. With 80
per cent, of the Australian pro-
duction going to British coun-
tries, leaving a mere 15,000
tons for non-Britishers, the
Japanese market was wide open
for other producers.
Until the Nitto Shosen Line
resumed regular sailings to and
from New Zealand, Australia
had the added advantage of
frequent and regular sailings.
Then there was insufficient
refrigerated space in the Nitto
Shosen ships; they were
augmented by refrigerated
whale-meat carriers of between
450- and 800-ton capacity.
Climax was reached in June
when the Timaru Star landed
a record shipment of 4500 tons
at Yokohama. In four months
10,000 tons of New Zealand
beef had arrived, compared
with 730 tons during the pre-
ceding six months. Timaru
Star was soon booked for
another load, while Port Line’s
interest was indicated by the
fixture of the Port Townsville
to load this month. These
companies will establish six-
weekly sailings from New
Zealand if the trade is main-
tained.
They won’t take all the
cargo. Nitto Shosen’s three new
5700-tonners will soon take
their share with monthly sail-
ings ; and the 2800-ton Danish
motorship Argentinean Reefer
has been diverted from her
regular South American service
to make an experimental
voyage this month.
Coincidental with the
Japanese development is the
increased demand for N.Z.
frozen foodstuffs in Malaya—
an increase traceable to the
Australian waterfront troubles
which forced Shaw Savill’s to
abandon their East Africa-
Australia direct service last
year.
New Zealand cargo from
East Africa, lacking a direct
connection, was transhipped at
Sydney. Singapore was the
logical alternative when the
Australian trade ceased. Royal
Interoceari Line, with ships
plying between Africa and
Singapore, were also interested
in the Malaya-N.Z. Confer-
ence, even though they had
not resumed on that trade after
the war.
Union Line of N.Z. and
8.1. Line had maintained
approximate monthly sailings
between Singapore and N.Z.
Naturally averse to giving all
the additional African tran-
shipments to their rivals, Royal
Interocean diverted two of
their own ships into the N.Z.
service. Competition became
keen as sailings were doubled.
More frequent and well-
established Australian connec-
tions had, until then, adequately
covered Malaya’s food require-
ments. But Malayan buyers
were quick to take advantage
of the frequent and regular
arrival of high-quality meat
and dairy-produce from N.Z.
It wasn’t long before hold-
space, as well as the limited
refrigerated-capacity, from that
country was fully booked,
despite the additional sailings.
Both Royal Interocean and
the Union Line are now build-
ing new tonnage for the trade.
They will have increased
freezer and some deep-freeze
space. Next year the Dutch
company will arrange regular
six-weekly opportunities, while
Union and 8.1. will guarantee
monthly fixtures.
Another aspect of these extra
sailings was their effect on the
Queensland canned-pineapple
trade to N.Z. Sailings from
Brisbane had been irregular,
forcing buyers to favor the
Malayan market. Although
the Queensland product was
generally accepted as being of
superior quality, their N.Z.
sales fell appreciably. They
have recovered since the Union
Line announced regular sail-
ings from Brisbane.
Just another example of
trade following regular sailings.
Melbourne Real Estate
ALTHOUGH it was offered
on Kathleen Mavourneen
terms of £lO,OOO deposit,
£90,000 next March and the
balance in 1962, there was no
bid for the “Argus” building
in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne.
The building has five upper
floors, a basement, a frontage
of 212|ft. to Elizabeth Street
and includes the site of the
Mission of St. James and St.
John.
Yet office-space in Melbourne
is so expensive, and rents for
new buildings so prohibitive
for smaller shows, that many of
them, including professionals,
are moving to St. Kilda Road
and Queen’s Road, East and
West Melbourne, and Jolimont.
Apparently even the very
rich, who might be expected
to bid for a big, comparatively
modern building such as the
“Argus” structure, like every-
body else, simply haven’t got
the money—or the incentive.

Atom Show
Making his usual annual visit
to the Royal Show in Mel-
bourne The Bulletin man this
year decided that the best time
to see it was before it opened
and before the public had been
admitted.
There seemed to be more
cars, trucks, Martian monsters
on wheels, sheep, cows, pigs,
horses and people than on a
regular show day. There were,
however, no spectators except
pressmen, the World’s Fattest
Lady, who was maintaining
her condition in a cafe, and
the World’s Smallest Giant,
who was washing down a four-
’n’-twenty in ?l milk-bar. The
rest of the army of occupa-
tion was feverishly engaged
putting the final touches to the
40-acre canvas.
The Bulletin man, who has
an associational love of tradi-
tional farming methods, went
looking for the Clydesdales,
but they had either not arrived
or had all been made into pets’
meat. This thought so saddened
him that he couldn’t bear to
look at the tractors, stabilisers,
earth-removers and other
symptoms of the new industrial
era, beautiful, glittering and
majestic as they .were.
He drifted through the
portals of the Centenary Hall
Which was in a state of
immense confusion. He was
about to beat a retreat when
he observed a tiny island of
order amongst the prevailing
chaos. “ATOMIC ACHIEVE-
MENT, Britain’s enterprise in
a new field of Human
Endeavor,” it was labelled. He
approached it and was examin-
ing the model of an atomic
factory covering many acres
when he was pounced on by a
trade-commissioner, a public-
relations’ officer and a 24-year-
old nuclear scientist who
promptly drowned him in
nuclear science and - then
resuscitated him with Scotch
whisky. '
The Bulletin man was then
shown a film in Eastmancolor,
suitably accompanied by the
music of the great composers,
which told in ecstatic language
the history of the nine research-
stations, the 19 power-stations
and the sundry other colossal
undertakings in nightmare
shapes which Britain’s Atomic
Energy Authority has erected
or is determined to erect
between John o’ Groats and
Land’s End —a £3350-million
programme. By 1965 they will
be pumping one-quarter of
Britain’s electricity require-
ments into the national system ;
by then a single unit will cost
two-thirds of a penny, while by
1970" the figure is likely to
have dropped to under a half-
penny. “By then the coalminer
is likely to be as extinct as the
Clydesdale,” remarked The
Bulletin man. “Very likely,”
said the nuclear scientist.
“Very likely.”
Other figures mentioned
were temperatures of 300-
million degrees, which was
difficult to grasp in the
temperature of the Centenary
Hall, which was round about
50. Having taken his fill of
radioactive isotopes, fissile
piles, Australian uranium
mines, cyclotrons, fast-breeder
reactors and Scotch, The
Bulletin man stepped out of
the Centenary Hall into a
world which seemed as hope-
lessly old - fashioned as
Grandma’s bustle.
The only thoughts that
cheered him were in a few
days’ time into the arena would
be pouring all the animal life
of the country ladies on
Garryowens, Clydesdales in
brewery-wagons, pigs, goats,
Friesians, Aberdeen Anguses
and Jerseys ; that in the wood-
chopping stadium axes would
be ringing, and that the largest
mangelwurzel in captivity
would be demonstrating the
atomic energy of Nature in
the agricultural pavilion. And
he will boil his hat for soup and
drink it if it won’t be the same
in 1970, when the new
industrial revolution will have
supplanted the old industrial
revolution. *
Stage and Music
“The Bartered Bride”
A fault in the mechanism of
the revolving stage (which
caused a knock like a car-
penter’s hammering) and some
ragged work by the chorus gave
an indifferent start to the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s
Sydney production of Smetana’s
charm ing folk-opera of
Bohemian village-life. But all
faults were duly rectified, and
the opera went on to notch a
resounding success.
The bustling beginning of
Act 111, where the travelling
show arrives in the village and
the preview of their acts given
by the various members cul-
minates in the famous “Dance
of the Comedians” was the
highlight of the opera.
Elsie Morison was a capti-
vating and vivacious Marjenka,
and brought-off some lovely
singing in the more reposeful
episodes; Vashek, the stutter-
ing gauche son of the wealthy
landowner, was sung by Ray-
mond Macdonald, who
cleverly adapted his tenor to
the puerilities of the role; Nflil
Warren-Smith used his fine
bass with style as Ketzal, the
greedy marriage-broker whose
schemes are confounded; and
Max Worthley, though rather
hobbled in lus wooing, sang
well enough, except for a
crack on one high note, in the
role of the shrewdheaded lover
Jenik. ,
❖ ❖ ❖
Ricci and Infantino
The entire Italian population
of Melbourne is at present to
be found nightly at the Town
Hall, where Ruggiero Ricci is
alternating with Luigi Infan-
tino. Luigi has a big voice
in a big body and its size is
equalled by its richness. It is
so rich at times as to overwhelm
the contents of the songs, but
when it sings “Santa Lucia”
all Naples floats up into the
mind’s eye and the bravissimos
are deafening.
His expatriate fellow-
countryman Ruggiero extracts
from his fiddle an extra-
ordinary amount of feel-
ing. His instrument laughed
and lamented through the Saint
Saens B Minor Concerto, more
like the human voice than an
affair of strings and catgut, and
again the applause was deafen-
ing, though some of it certainly
went to the Victorian Sym-
phony Orchestra for its sensi-
tive accompaniment under
Nicolai Malko’s masterful
direction.
The Russian conductor’s
baton steered the orchestra
through a glittering per-
formance of Sibelius’s Second
Symphony and a noisy render-
ing of a noisy “Rodeo,” by
Aaron Copland.
The gem of Ricci’s last recital
was the wonderful Bach
Chaconne for unaccompanied
violin. In it Ricci and Bach
were at one, and the result was
a complete world of beauty.

Kurt Woess in Brisbane
After several years away
from the concert platform in
Brisbane, Kurt Woess has
made two reappearances. Of
the two concerts, the one given
to a youth audience had the
more vitality, and showed once
again how the liveliness and
enthusiasm of an audience can
get the best out of a conductor
and his players.
Haydn’s “Oxford” Sym-
phony may be centuries away
from the imaginative world of
its listeners in the 20th century,
but its gaiety wears well what-
ever the age of the music.
Even the protracted nostalgia
of the slow movement of
Schubert’s “Unfinished” Sym-
phony seemed to find a ready
response in the audience, which
is, after all, not so remarkable.
TTie moods of youth change
with wonderful suddenness
from extreme tension to reflec-
tiveness, and the “Unfinished”
has a faint melancholy which
never becomes self-pity.
There was plenty of tension
in a lusty account of “Don
Juan,” by Strauss, and finally
there was Ravel’s “Bolero.”
The constant repetition of the
same little phrase would be
maddening if one did not have

the unkind pleasure of wonder-
ing what might happen if the
players let their heads go too
soon and found themselves
without wind or strength to
gasp out the rest of the gradual
build-up of sound.
A subscription programme
began with the first piece of
12-tone music to be heard
locally. Rolf Liebermann’s
“Furioso” was a short piece,
as fast and furious as the title
suggests. It was highly-strung
music, even in the quieter
moments. A younger audience
would have felt spine-shivers
from it, but as it was, the
reception it had was chilly in
extreme.
The programme then settled
into the depths of musical con-
servatism as though to atone
for the cheekiness of the open-
ing piece. Mozart’s “Linz”
Symphony had an affectionate
performance, but Tschai-
kowsky’s Fourth did not get
the same attention. No other
symphony has so many oppor-
tunities for raucous playing,
and Woess let the brass drown
out everyone else far too often.

Dobell’s Mary Gilmore
Dobell’s portrait of Mary
Gilmore is, of course, a carica-
ture, or at least set in some
twilight borderland between
reality and distortion. Of
course, too, it is a strange
contrast with the excellent
straightforward likeness which
Joshua. Smith painted some
years ago; and an even
stranger contrast with the
charming Tom Roberts por-
traits that one passes on the
way to it at the N. S. Wales
National Gallery.
But then a girlish charm was
not exactly what Dobell was
aiming at in this portrait. Nor
was a straightforward likeness.
Nor can it be proved that
caricature is not art, or even
that Dobell’s work finally
crosses the indefinable border
between caricature and
portraiture.
The painting is, in fact, much
more of a likeness than news-
paper reproduction can
indicate. So much, for example,
can be said by a pair of clear
brown eyes, which you just
don’t see in a newspaper. And
so much more, when you see
the full proportions of the pic-
ture, not cramped in a repro-
duction, can be said by the
proud set of a head.
It is undoubtedly a very
queer painting—the queerest
which Dobell has exhibited for
years. But it is not merely
repetitive ; the handling of the
drapes is extraordinary. The
final effect is to make Dame
Mary look like some sibyl of
the cave, some tribal
ancestress: a most striking
impression, and true enough at
that.

G. K. Townshend
A departure into a lighter
key than usual gives a general
effect of freshness to G. K.
Townshend’s exhibition at
Sydney Grosvenor Galleries;
but except for “A Northern
Behch,” where people wade
very softly to shore through
blue, iridescent shallows, his
strongest and most decisive
statements still come from his
more sombre watercolors.
“Farm Barns, Gerringong,”
with maroon rooftops manifest-
ing themselves with quiet, rich
color through shadow and
foliage, is the sort of thing he
can do perfectly ; likewise the
massive, dark-green spreading
pinetree of “Near the Home-
stead.”
“Chaos,” with lightning-
struck trees and a grey cliff in
swirling mist, is an extremely
powerful gouache; and “The
Boatman’s House,” where an
underlying pen-stroke rein-
forces the wash and firmly
delineates the white fence con-
verging on the white house and
white sails over the rise, is
something of a tour-de-force of
technique.

Sali Herman
It is much to Sali Herman’s
credit that after years of per-
sistent painting he has
persuaded the most conserva-
tive if not the most revolution-
ary of us that Sydney’s slum
tenements are so charming in
their quiet colors and simple
forms that they should never be
pulled down ; or at least well
deserve immortalising before
they go.
In previous shows Herman
has demonstrated that he can
range beyond these narrow
streets to cope with the
equally bare and simple forms
of humpies in the outback
plains, windmills and country
railway-stations.
But in his current show at
Sydney Macquarie Galleries,
because of the naivety of his
draftsmanship and the lushness
of his color when Nature does
not control it, his departures
are not so successful. His
band-rotunda is rococo; his
Barrier Reef fish are fuzzy ; his
dogs look wooden and his cats
look drunk.
But the slums —“Surry Hills
Street” and half-a-dozen others
—remain. harmonious and
lightly charming.

“A Hatful of Rain”
“A Hatful of Rain,” from
the Broadway success by
Michael V. Gazzo, has an
innate vitality, intelligent
direction by Fred Zimmerman,
and sensitive portrayals of its
four leading characters.
The addict is a young man
returned from the Korean War,
where, drugged to ease the pain
of his injuries, he got the habit.
His pregnant wife, unaware of
his addiction, blames his
ineptitude on an affair with
another woman ; frustrated, she
encourages her husband's
brother, who, as well as having
his brother’s secret to keep, has
had to provide the money for
the drugs. When their father
visits them, the drama sparks,
rising to a climax when the
young addict, prompted by his
brother, discloses to his wife
and then to his father that he
is a “junky.”
Not as concentrated on the
actual lust as was Sinatra’s
“Man with the Golden Arm,”
the film is, therefore, not as
ugly ; simply and honestly told,
it is imperative in its manner of
probing. Zimmerman is as
effective when he is playing the
drama to concert-pitch as when
he side-sweeps on New York
life for his atmosphere:
burrowlike tenements, hazy
sidewalks, bleak playgrounds,
tin-can living and high-pressure
office efficiency—some forlorn
quality to it all.
As the addict, Don Murray
rises to the occasion in a diffi-
cult part, and suffers with a
fine sense of proportion. As his
wife, Eva Marie Saint is at
once sweet and compelling.
Lloyd Nolan gives a clever
interpretation of a difficult
character as the querulous
father who refuses, or is unable,
to see the span of remoteness
that exists between him and his
sons.
But it is Anthony Franciosa’s
brilliant portrayal of the
brother that gives the film its
character. He has a rare
command of virile emotions, on
which the role makes big
demands not the least in a
drunken scene, which he does
with refreshing vagary.
At Sydney Mayfair.

“The Postmaster”
Filmed in Agfacolor—which
does full justice to the
brilliant indoor scenes ,of
Army-society life in Tsarist
St. Petersburg—this film (with
English sub-titles) is an excel-
lent example of German
craftsmanship, with the Pushkin
story given a fine emotional
sweep.
The postmaster of a little
isolated Russian village hears
that his only daughter, who
had ostensibly gone to St.
Petersburg to marry a hand-
some Army-officer, has simply
become the mistress of several.
In a towering rage he. goes to
the city, but, one of the officers
getting wind of his coming, he
is fobbed-off with a plausible
tale of delayed nuptials. The
officer arranges a mock
wedding-ceremony, and the old
man does himself proud at the
resultant festivities and returns
home happy.
The film is lit by a com-
passionate and human per-
formance from Walter Richter,
as the simple old man whose
life is bound up in his daughter
and his work, while Eva Bartok
portrays the varying emotions
of the daughter with sympathy
and insight. Ivan Desny fills
in neatly the role of the blasd,
pleasure-seeking captain. At

“The Seventh Sin”
This remake of Somerset/
Maugham’s “Painted Veil” has
Eleanor Parker as the un-
faithful wife who, for punish-
ment, is manoeuvred by her
medico-husband into going
with him from their Hong
Kong home to a cholera-
infested Chinese village, where,
at last finding respect for the
husband she has despised, she
works out her own salvation in
selfless work. *
Miss Parker handles the early
scenes of guilt and sullen
resentment more surely than
she does those of her rehabilita-
tion, and Bill Travers, burly
and surly, never quite gets to
the core of the doctor’s
character. George Sanders,
beginning as one .of those
phlegmatic, whisky - swilling
English-exile boundahs, veers
off at a tangent halfway along
the celluloid track and emerges
as quite a noble-hearted fellow
who is really attached to his
beautiful Chinese wife.
Ronald Neame’s direction
gets its best effects in the
scenes in the convent which
is turned into a temporary
hospital to cope with the out-
break. At Sydney Liberty.
“Jacqueline”
Gently sentimental drivel
about a slum-father who keeps
getting drunk because he has
to work in a Belfast shipyard
while craving for life on a
farm. His schoolgirl-daughter
works his redemption through
the grizzled old shipmaster
who isn’t really as hard-
hearted as he first appears.
John Gregson does his best
with the script, but he must
have shuddered at the assign-
ment. At Sydney Lyceum.

Elder, Smith and Co., Ltd.
the largest woolbroker and stock-
and-station agent in the country, the
Elder Smith organisation handled 15.43
p.c. of all wool received into store by
individual brokers last season, a 10.6 p.c.
improvement in the parent co.’s earnings
reflecting the increase in both wool prices
and the size of the total wool-clip—the
two chief factors in determining the co.’s
income.
Expanding rapidly in the post-war
years, Elder, Smith and Co. has, over the
last two terms, absorbed the Common-
wealth Wool and Produce Co., Ltd.
(Sydney), N.E.N.C.0., Ltd. (Newcastle),
and Moreheads, Ltd. (Brisbane), the group
operating at eight of the 10 major main-
land selling-centres.
Paid capital, in £1 ords. paid to 125.,
reached £5,305,637 early last term follow-
ing the issue of-521,837 shares in exchange
for the £lBO,OOO share-capital of More-
heads, the transaction, with share-issues
to the staff, bringing in £285,732 of pre-
miums. Shareholders were last invited to
increase their holdings in 1955 when
2,826,300 £1 shares paid to 12s. were
offered (three for five) at 18s., the uncalled
liability, in all cases, being regarded as a
reserve. The co. has failed to make an
annual distribution only once in 118 years
of trading, divs. over the past 10 years
averaging 11.2 p.c. A cut in the div.-rate
in 1956 (from 12 p.c. to 11 p.c.) was
restored last term.
Last season, for the third successive
year, Australian woolgrowers produced
and sold a record quantity of wool, Elder,
Smith and its subsidiaries handling
748,982 (up 125,786) of the 4,886,561
bales sold during the season. Although
primarily a woolbroker, the co. derives
a sizeable share of its earnings from its
activities as stock-and-station agent and
general merchant, the following table

departments of the business:

The conservative book-value of fixed
assets dropped by £165,790 during the
term (despite the opening of 18 new
branches), long-term finance for the
extensive building programme now in
progress being obtained through a
recently-formed property-holding sub-
sidiary.
The purchase of the general-agency and
store business of N. M. Loutit, Ltd. (Alice
Springs), following the absorption of
N.E.N.C.O. and Moreheads (completed
early in the term and partly responsible
for the £1,214,574 addition to the value
of shares in subsidiaries), giving the co.
its first branch in the Northern Territory.
Although continuing to establish new
branches (seven have been opened in the
current term, bringing the total to 186)
consolidation, rather than expansion,
appears to be the main aim of the board,
with further integration of parent and
subsidiary operations as the immediate
objective.
. After some weakness at opening sales,
wool prices in the current selling-season
have recovered to a level roughly 7 ±
p.c. below the values ruling at the close
of the preceding series, forecasts of yet
another record clip encouraging hopes of
a profitable season and the maintenance
of a high export-income.
Net tangible backing for the 12s. paid


on the co.’s £1 ords. is 225. 9d. (parent’s
accounts only), a continued 12 p.c. div.
giving buyers at 265. a return of 5.5 p.c.
John Mcllwraith Industries, Ltd.
HIGH earning-power characteristic of
the John Mcllwraith Industries busi-
ness since it was floated into a 'public
co. in March, 1951, has now been
translated into higher dividends. After
distributions of p.c. p.a. for each of
the past five years, the final for the latest
term was lifted to 15 p.c. p.a., making
13| p.c. for the full year, and it is the
“present intention of the directors to
maintain a dividend-rate of 15 p.c. p.a.
providing conditions in the building
industry remain reasonably stable.”
Net earnings last term represented
27.5 p.c. on capital, compared with 27.2,
28.9, 22.5 and 17.6 p.c. back to 1953.
The increased div .-rate therefore looks to
be well within the co.’s resources, subject
to the directors’ qualification, and the
liquid position won’t be strained in
meeting it.
The business has been established for
over a century, and there are now a
parent co. and 11 integrated subsidiaries,
operating in all States. The business
depends on activity in the building and
chemicals industries; the group manu-
factures or handles a large range of
builders’ and plumbers’ hardware,
specialising in the production of lead pipes
and fittings used in acid-plants, batteries,
etc., as well as in general plumbing,
plumbers’ brassware, and c.i.p.e. baths,
sinks and basins.
There have been a number of additions
and extensions to the co.’s functions in
the past few years, and additional land
has been bought at Coburg and Dande-
nong in Victoria, also at Brisbane. The
company seems to have a well-balanced
assortment of enterprises, and makes no
complaints about conditions that, over
the past two years, have set some others
in the builders’-fittings trades back on
their heels ; the board does say that trad-
ing conditions throughout Australia have
been extremely competitive, but con-
siders the co. has had a satisfactory year,
and dt “looks to the immediate future
With confidence.”
Trading profit for the past term was
£5078 higher than in the preceding term
at £687,436. Provisions, including
£55,514 for depreciation and £256,588 for
taxation, showed little change, and net
profit was £4553 higher at £371,346:

As much as was distributed in the
increased div. was left for reserves, which
in the books are now rapidly reaching
for the level of paid capital, but which are
subject to intangibles of £497,042. A few
more massive additions to reserves such
as have been a feature of the past four
years, and the reserve position will begin
to look really healthy.
Though there have been some
moderate increases in stock-valuations
over the past two years, probably due
to price-increases, the most significant
movements in the balance-sheet have been
in buildings and plant:

Book-value of plant, up £350,809 in two
years, has slightly more than doubled
in the time. Movements have been
mainly in respect of a brass-extrusion
press, extensions to the c.i.p.-enamelware
factory in Sydney, and the new Dande-
nong store. These extensions of a capital
nature have been financed without
recourse to shareholders (except that
previously some outside businesses were
acquired by share-issues), and the earn-
ing-potential of the undertaking seems to
be steadily expanding, subject to a con-
tinuance of favorable trading conditions.
The popularity of stainless-steel baths,
sinks, etc., may in the end affect sales
of the co.’s c.i.p.e.-ware.
For several years John Mcllwraith 10s.
fully-paid ords. have been among the
most stable industrial investments in the
Commonwealth f showing little variation
up or down, and usually to be bought to
yield about 6 p.c. Following the div.-
lift the shares have risen to 265. 9d., to
return 5.6 p.c. Market estimation of the
stock has obviously been heightened by
the fact that the co. has, in a dividend
sense, “come good” in what has been a
comparatively difficult year for others,
and it has done so despite the fact that
its earnings, visibly, were not as great as
they were in the record 1955 term.
A. Goninan & Co., Ltd.
npHE 12s. shares in A. Goninan and Co.,
-*• Ltd., Broadmeadow (Newcastle,
N.S.W.), are among the highest-priced
industrial stocks on the Australian Stock
Exchanges. At 575. they are nearly five
times their par-value. Among the few
other concerns in that Stock Exchange
price-class are W. H. Soul and Melbourne
“Herald,” as well as the two leading N.Z.
insurance cos.
At 575. the shares of A. Goninan yield
4.2 p.c. on a 20 p.c. div. basis. The back-
ing in both assets and earning-power is
exceptionally high for this type of
business.
The co. was formed in 1905 to take
over an established iron-foundry, manu-
facturing and structural-engineering con-
cern. The co. now describes its opera-
tions, apart from its structural activities,
as “manufacturers of rolling-stock, skips,
mining and rubber machinery, boilers,
drop-forgings, iron and brass castings,
gear-cutting—spur, helical, worm and
bevel gearing.”
In the depression, when even Broken
Hill Proprietary, also in the Newcastle
area, missed its div. for three years (Goni-
nan’s depend on B.H.P. for much of
their work), Goninan’s had a thin time,
too, and Bs. was struck-off the £1 shares
in order to wipe-out trading losses and
a debit arising from the writing-down
of fixed assets. After an eight-year break,
shareholders received a 2? p.c. div. in
1936. By 1940 the rate had risen to 10
p.c., and it was maintained for the next
decade. Since then nothing less than 15
p.c. has been' paid (20 p.c. for the past
four years), and capital has been more
than doubled by four separate capitalisa-
tions of reserves.
The spectacular movement in Goninan’s
profit-earning is partly to be seen in these
figures covering a 10-year period: —■

In addition to those earnings, last year
there was £24,832 of 1956-57 undistributed
profit in Engineers and Colliery Supplies
Co., Ltd., in which Goninan’s own
94,992 Of the 95,008 £l shares.
In the preceding year the undistributed
current profit of this subsidiary was
£35,339, and the year before that the
figure was £42,438.
Taking the contemporaneous earning-
figures of the subsidiary into account,
there would seem to have been a steadying
of the advance in overall profit-earning,
as disclosed.
Last term, after including £9500 received
from the subsidiary (nothing was passed
on in the two preceding years), gross
profit of the parent increased from
£346,230 to £384,545. Allowing £113,000
for taxation (up £11,500) and £23,876 for
depreciation (up £6419), and charging
administration exes., net profit was
£16,700 higher at £177,184. But including
the undistributed profit of the sub-
sidiary it was £6193 higher at £202,016,
and equal to 54 p.c. on paid capital—a
slight improvement on the preceding year.
Shareholders, of course, have been
more than compensated for the Bs. a
share struck-off in 1935, and since then
no issues have been made for cash. The
entire expansion of the business has been
financed out of profits, retentions and
normal trade-credit —not even an over-
draft last balance-day. The extension of
plant-capacity should have been economi-
cally .carried out in view of the part the
co.’s own works played in it. Always
regarded as having been in the books at a
conservative figure, in the 1956 term the
co.’s land and buildings were written-up

Though the holding in the sub-
sidiary, Engineers and Colliery
Supplies Co., appears at par
(£94,992), this concern had
reserves of £163,059 at balance-
day, and most of them belong
to the parent also. Including
them, net tangible backing, on
conservative book-values, for
the parent’s 12s. shares amounts
to about 425. 6d.
The general - engineering
industry in Australia, which
received a fillip from the
recovery in city - building
activity, has levelled-off, and
competition for business has
lately grown keener. Boiler-
construction has been sustained
and demand for railway-rolling-
stock has been steady.
Goninan’s, with their spread
of activities and their traditional
associations with B.H.P. and
Howard Smith, should con-
tinue to fare better than most.
The co.’s strong financial posi-
tion should also be of great
value at the present time.
The big B.H.P. expansion
programme, under which £lOO
million is to be spent in five
years, should already have had
an effect on Goninan’s figures,
and no spectacular increase is
likely to enter profits from that
quarter during the current
year, unless completion of
work-in-progress has been
unduly prolonged. Some coal-
mining - machinery orders
should have reached their
peak also. Under the taxation
concessions extended to coal-
mining cos. in recent years
very large sums have been
spent on mechanisation of
collieries on the Newcastle and
Maitland coalfields.
Thabawleik Tin Dredging
CHAREHOLDERS in
Thabawleik Tin Dredging,
Ltd. (which indicated its inten-
tion of going into liquidation
last year), will be asked at a
general meeting next month
to approve resolutions relating
to the winding-up of the co.
The directors expect that the
full amount of the paid capital
will be returned in an initial
distribution following “almost
immediately” on the accep-
tance of the board’s proposals,
with the liquidation being
completed within the next
twelve months. The last div.
(Is. a share, less Burmese and
Malayan taxes) went out in
September, ’56.
After treating tailings for
some time the co.’s dredge
ceased work at Thabawleik
(Lower Burma) at the end of
November, 1956, operations
resulting in a loss of £7178
for the year to June 30 last.
After allowing for excess tax-
provisions, Burmese super-tax
of £17,002 (paid under protest)
and the net loss (£11,008) on
realisation of certain assets took
the total deficit for the year to
£37,043. (All figures are shown
in sterling.)
At the end of the term the
balance-sheet disclosed fixed
assets estimated to realise

SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
to Policyholders of
The MUTUAL LIFE and CITIZENS’
Assurance Company Limited
• Increased Bonus Rates for 1956
Rates of bonus allotted to participating policies in the Ordinary
Branch for the year 1956 have been substantially increased
by amounts varying, according to the class of policy, from 11%
to 19% of the rates declared for the previous year. Provided
no bonuses were surrendered during 1956, the bonuses allotted
to policies for 1956 are therefore at least 11% more than those
for the year 1955
# Bonus Certificates
To facilitate the considerable re-organisation necessary in the
change-over to modern mechanical and electronic methods of
record-keeping, and also on account of the acute shortage of
office space up to the time of the recent occupancy of the
Company’s new Head Office building at North Sydney, bonus
certificates will not be issued this year. In 1958, however, a
certificate prepared by the new methods will be forwarded to
the holders of all participating policies, showing the total bonuses
existing both at 31st December, 1956, and at 31st December,
1957, including the bonus allotted for each year.
The Company is confident that policyholders will, appreciate
the reasons for the temporary departure from its normal prac-
tice and will accept this statement as a guide to the bonuses
allotted until the -bonus certificates are issued in 1958.

[From L,. OwenJ
•READERS of the “Wild Cat
Column” are not likely to
have any uncertainty as to the
evaluation of the gas—much
less the oil—prospects of Dural
No. 1.
That bore reached 5203 ft.,
at which depth it was
abandoned after striking two
insignificant showings of “low-
pressure gas consisting of 97
per cent, methane” —a normal
expectation just above, or in,
the coal-measures.
Unless some very promising
information —none of Which
has been published—has been
withheld, the drilling of Dural
No. 2 well, about two miles
to the west of No. 1, is diffi-
cult to justify. However, it
will serve to keep the co.’s rig
occupied, and will thus delay
the commencement of drilling
operations on what appears to
be the even less hopeful Kurra-
jong Heights bore, where work
was suspended some years ago
at 4755 ft.

London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
'T'HERE is nothing strikingly
new in this year’s Radio
Show (Earl’s Court). Electronic
novelties, once a source of
wonder, are passed by with a
mere word of recognition ; the
printed circuit is now an
accomplished fact; transistors
have, as yet, their limitations ;
magnetic-tape recordings and
their concomitant, stereophonic
sound, have appealed only to
the few; the reception of
,VHF radio, introduced to
overcome Europe’s badly-
congested wave-bands, has
proved disappointing (although
within reach of 87 per cent,
of the population, not more
than 5 per cent, have changed
over to it); and color-tele-
vision is still a distant prospect.
But the glossiness, virility
and (to the layman) technical
virtuosity of the industry are as
astonishing as ever. Much in-
genuity has obviously been
applied in meeting competitive
demands. Despite increased
costs, prices have been held
stable, even reduced. With
bigger screens and better con-
struction, prices of sets are
only slightly higher than they
were in the early post-war
years. The most popular size
of screen is 17 infches (compared
with 9 inches 10 years ago),
and this type of set retails at
about £BO sterling. All the
time the tendency is, naturally
enough, towards the bigger
screen, and manufacturers
expect increased sales of the
21-inch size, now retailing at
upwards of £lOO. As the view-
ing-area increases, so does the
proportionate size of the set
decrease. Thanks to technical
skill, a 90° deflection angle has
been attained (originally it was
55°) and a deflection of 110°
will be reached soon; this
means, of course, a much
shallower model.
Both TV and radio sales
appear to have' reached their
peaks (in both instances, at
about \\ million a year). One
manufacturer offers a portable
TV, with a 9-inch screen, at
45 guineas—as a secondary set,
for use in another room “to
avoid family squabbles.”
At present, one household in
two has television and, of these,
two out of three prefer the
commercial programmes.
Although the 8.8. C. emphati-
cally declares its intention to
maintain sound-broadcasting,
there has been a noticeable
falling-off in dynamic, and in
quality, during the last two
years or so. The Third Pro-
gramme is to be cut and part
of its time, the “peak” hours
of 6-8 p.m., is to be devoted
to hobbies and' pastimes with
a view to gaining a new,
regular audience:
It promises to be a losing
struggle, both to the corpora-
tion' and to the listener. The
tendency is away from sound
and, as the TV programmes
improve, so must more and
more households, at present
loath to become “tqjly-gawpers”
(a Yorkshire expression), yield
to the inevitable.
Sales-talk
Television-advertising, after
heavy initial losses, is steadily
recouping itself. Although only
one adult in four views “com-
mercials,” the advertising
appropriation is 9 p.c. of the
country’s totals. Moreover, the
fact that contractors have
chosen to reduce their cost, per
1000 viewers is a positive sign
that they expect higher returns.
While the 8.8. C. prefers to
consolidate and build -up
slowly, I.T.V. i s expanding
fast, possibly at some detriment
to long-term considerations. It
is held that much wastage of
viewers’ money, in the form
of expensive adaptors and
alternative aerials, might have
been avoided by better co-
ordination between the Post-
master-General, the 8.8. C. and
the I.T.A.
Although television is a time-
and-money-saver to industry,
again the pace is too fast. So
far, only the large concerns
have adopted the new tech-
niques, which record the
happenings in such diverse
spots as atomic piles, wind-
tunnels, photographic manu-
facturers’ dark-rooms, hot-
strip mills, smoke-laden cities,
traffic-jams and diamond-
mines. The smaller firm is cost-
conscious and, maybe, too pre-
occupied to be aware of the
boon of the electronic eye ; and
there is no sales organisation,
either to find new markets or
to demonstrate its wares. But
cheaper cameras and accessories
are on their way, and the time
may be reached when no fair-
sized workshop is properly
equipped without a small
closed-circuit television.
Exports, particularly of
domestic radios, have been
maintained fairly steadily,
despite the import-restrictions
on the part of Commonwealth
countries. British manufac-
turers have managed to over-
come these difficulties by form-
ing subsidiaries and by joint-
production agreements. They
have also benefited by the con-
sequent increased exporf of
components. Here they have
the advantage over their
fiercest competitor, Western
Germany. On the other hand,
thpre are complaints that the
credit-squeeze has enabled the
Germans to capture a large
share of the luxury market, for
their terms of credit are so
generous that the dealer can
obtain all the instalment-
payments before he need
settle his account.
One outstanding development
is the export of sound-reproduc-
tion equipment, including
amplifiers, record-changers and
all that iqay be loosely
grouped l as “Hi-Fi.” This
market is still asking for more.
Damned
The current production at
the Arts Theatre has an added
insistence by virtue of its
accidental coincidence with the
Wolfenden Report on sexual
error. It is a serious play, if
not an exceptionally good one,
as wholesome and free from
corruption as a “pi-jaw.”
Indeed, “A Lonesome Road”
(by Philip King and Robin
Maugham) has much the same
effect, expounding the wages
of sin with an overemphasis
that is both didactic and
terrible.
A playwright, obviously
under a grievous shadow, has
hidden himself away in
Sussex where he avoids all
people other than his help-
housekeeper and his literary
agent. The authors reveal that
he has not long been released
from prison but shy at the
precise nature of his offence,
which eventually turns out to
be an isolated homosexual act
committed one afternoon when
drunk.
The first half of the play is
taken up with his evasion of
the noblesse oblige incumbent
on a man of letters in an
English village: the gushing
but kindly attentions of the
vicar’s daughter; the gauche
hero-worship of her young
brother ; and the persistent call
of the Women’s Institute for
his services as producer or
lecturer.
His embarrassed resistance
(for at heart he is generous
and sociable) provides conflict,
as do the alternate reassuring
and bullying of his agent,
determined to nurse his charge
back to success under another
name. But the characterisation,
humor - and villagery are
commonplace and the con-
struction is absurdly laborious
and premonitory.
It is not until the denoue-
ment, when the vicar (whose
professional veneer conceals a
waspish, uncharitable nature)
taxes the playwright with his
guilty secret, that the play
begins to grip. But this is soon
lost. The boy commits suicide
(he, it is learned, was expelled
from school for the same
offence as the playwright), and
the subsequent general con-
fessions of guilt at indirectly
causing his death are over-
drawn, detracting from the
central message.
This —the heartbreaking im-
possibility of being accepted by
society after an isolated aberra-
tion—comes through power-
fully and compassionately.
Best in an uneven cast of six
are Michael Atkinson as the
victim and Kenneth Edwards
as the accuser.


PIONEER WOMAN
By HAL PORTER
TEAR by exiled tear, un-
prophesied task by task,
long day by long day
. . . three years went by.
Tears-had soaked the loam
of patience until contentment
burgeoned sheltering and
spicy shrub ; tasks had revealed
their surprising felicities ; days
had become too short for all
that had to be done ; where, oh
where had her white hands
gone?
Trees were now trees to her.
Three years ago, straight
from English trees with their
cumuli of airy leaves supported
on subservient trunks, she had
been disconcerted by a reversal
of balance: Australian trunks
were not secondary pedestals,
but dominating pillars, two
hundred feet high, bestial,
shaggy. From these verticali-
ties peeled flakes and hair-
fringed wedges of hide, narrow
pelts, parchmenty scrolls, scabs
of bark. In England the leaves
had changed color; darted
away, fallen to reveal elaborate
w icker - work stuck with
deserted nests. Here, the leaves
were permanent, scanter by
millions, tough, acrid and
heavy ; they flashed and sickled
crudely, far up, dead-green.
Not real trees, her gentle
heart had said, not trees, not
trees. Not dust, her soles had
hissed through the mica-salted
sand ; not dust soft as bran.
No: a glittering earth where
all was perverse, extreme,
sensational and sinister—fly-
shaped brown flowers smelt
like white ones ; the water
spoke in palasographic patois ;
elegant birds emitted slum-
cries; insects of charm stung
like treachery; animals that
made her recoil with horrified
ejaculation from their night-
mare, Presences rebuked with
S^ nt gaze anc l f° r gi vin g'y
°ff ete d gloved frail hands,
All this the impertinent
heaven outstared, an immense
eye, unblinking, tearless, a lens
through which an unimaginable
mind vibrated down with
numbing discernment so that
she and the makeshift spilling
°f thirty-odd colonists crept
antlike and as though naked
through draughts of fear,
through silence that was now
and then lightninged by a nitric
shriek from the inner land, an
outrageous comment or warn-
mg from . . . from what? And
then, more powerfully, silence
iesumed under the unshattered
burning-glass of the sky.
But cough by cough the axe
ate a space in silence, the saw
geometrised peevishly and
inexorably, the hammer pecked
and pecked, tent became room
and room house, the brilliant
spring and its chalybeate soul
was welled-in, bones of dead
trees post-and-railed their own
slaughter-yard, the foxlike fire
was carried from where it
snapped in its nest of branches
under the alien stars to purr
and flutter like a winged cat in
its chimney of stones. The
immigrant cat licked the odor
of ocean and bush from its
wrists and posed Englishly
before the tamed flames. Soon,
the cows, the bull, the hens and
roosters, the boar and sow,
lifted eyelids in proper confines
and no longer had the sidelong
squint and demented voices of
creatures decrying ejection on
Ararat.
Crate after crate of England
and breeding were unpacked.
Again under a roof, her
voice no longer feared itself.
“Here! ” she called clearly, and
“Here!” and she gestured and
helped lug and lugged alone
and arranged and rearranged
the rosewood chairs, the side-
board, the bed, the Sheraton
looking-glass ; here, dresser and
bread-crock; here, silver
candelabra, Coalport dinner
service, nutmeg-grater; here,
the Bible, the bellows, her tea-
caddy ; here, the hook for the
lea-caddy key ; here, order,
sweetness, polish, custom, pat-
tern, solace, home and life.
Finally the oil-painted por-
traits were hung, some family
silhouettes and, from a rafter,
the chandelier one dared not
light beneath the thatch of
sedge.
AT first, because she was wife
to Major Hilton, Resident
Magistrate of the outrider
settlement, she was helped by
servants they had shipped with
them, but after fifteen months
these had gone.
“You cannot conceive,” she
wrote to England, “how
republican this Frontier
becomes; the Servant is now
indeed the Master. A Month
ago the last of our Rascals
wheedled Assignment to the
main Settlement which is to this
as London might be to
Penzance. Their Indentures
were up and they had not the

as obtains here. In Adversity

Montagu Island
Official tardiness as well as bungling by the original con-
tractors caused long delays in building the lighthouse on
Montagu Island, which is one of the best-known lights on
the New South Wales coast.
In 1873 an official decision was made to erect the light
"with all reasonable expedition,” yet four years passed before
the N.S.W. Government made the necessary money available.
In 1878, the contract was let to J. Musson and Co., but the
builders began badly. In defiance of the express orders of
the Colonial Architect, James Barnett, an explosive shot was
fired in the large boulder on which the lighthouse was to
stand. This shot detached a large mass of- rock and caused
the site of the tower to be shifted several feet.
After this unhappy start, nothing went right for the con-
tractors. The work progressed so slowly that the builders
abandoned the task and gave up their contract.
Fresh tenders were called in 1880. The new contractor,
W. H. Jennings, pushed the work ahead rapidly. The light
was put into operation on November 1, 1881.
The light is 262 ft. above high water and stands in a 63 ft.
tower, which is conspicuous in daytime to vessels passing
either inside or outside Montagu Island.
Two lights were installed—a fixed light of 7,500 candle
power and a flashing light of 45,000 candle power. The
flashing light was strengthened in 1910 to 250,000 candle
power, and the power of both lights was raised in 1923.
The fixed lights is now of 24,500 candle power and the
flashing light has been increased to 357,000 candle power
with a visibility of 20 miles.
An area of 310 acres on Montagu Island is reserved as a
seal rookery, and the National 1 Trust in co-operation with
the lightkeepers guards the island as a sanctuary for flora
and fauna. Visitors are not permitted on the island with-
out the joint permission of the Trust and of the Department
of Shipping and Transport.
Montagu Island is 7£ miles from the mainland town of
Narooma and is 150 miles from Sydney by sea. The position
of the light is latitude 36“ 15' south, longitude 150° 14' east.

its Defects. Though perceiving
their Attachment to us was
feebler than suspected, neither
Hilton nor I should care to
block the Path of those think-
ing to better themselves; but
their wholesale Departure is
provoking, and new Servants
hard to come by. Accordingly,
we diminish Plans, and I
increase my Burden of Labors
by many not foreseen, and
Skill in which I must immedi-
ately gain, for there is only
intermittent Help procurable
and that for Tasks obviously
beyond my physical Powers.”
Ariadne Hilton became her
own servants-: housemaid, char-
woman, baker, cook, milkmaid,
dairymaid, washerwoman,
gardener. Since she' was barren
she had not to be nursemaid:
doll’s house, hobby-horse,
tops, slates and skipping-ropes
remained unpacked. If she did
not bear, everything else did;
beneath the impertinent sun
and startling moon everything
else conceived, fattened, threw
out lovable descendants —she
became godmother, learning
from them and happy so. She
milked the cows to feed calves
and piglets, divided and spaced
the primroses in generations,
watered the pioneer seedlings,
spread her wings above the
outfanned wings of the hen sail-
ing the barbed grasses with its
furry wake of chickens. Solitary
often, for her husband was
often away from the settlement,
she had no unused time to
cultivate the anguishes of lone-
liness.
Meantime, hardworking as
she, the other settlers slaved,
bickered, suffered, exulted, bore
children, and inch by inch
Anglicised their fragments of
primitive vastness, noticing
their transplantations, their
children and themselves take on
imperceptibly different qualities
from a nourishment of strange
rains and soils, a diet of wilder
airs and new customs.
Sometimes, at night, alone,
she heard the others, drunk
with rum and feverish with
nostalgia, shouting and singing
in the distance. At such times
she was conscious of the unique
nature of her loneliness, and
could write:
“It sinks me most that there
is no Female of my own Rank
with whom to enjoy the
Niceties of civilised Inter-
course. I had had great Expec-
tations when Lieutenant Ost,
himself a Person not without
Breeding and who had arrived
six Months before his Wife,
acquainted us that she was en
voyage and fast nearing this
Strand. She had delayed her
Departure to give Birth to their
third Child. I made Prepara-
tions for her Greeting as hand-
somely as our limited Resources
allow, and was quite aflutter.
Alas! It would be tedious to
narrate how my Expectations
jvere cruelly blasted.
“I write kindly when I pen
that the Lieutenant, in plucking
a showy Blossom for his
Boutonniere, has soiled his
Boots —in short, has wedded
much below his Station. Not
only is his Wife too patently
of the lower Orders, but of the
worst Sort; she is vastly vulgar
and, although boldly beautiful,
has a vacant Mien, a giggling
Habit and a common Voioe —a
Combination not to be borne
no Matter what unrevealed and
admirable Qualities may hide
beneath the unseemly Bushel.
There can be no Thought of
our Acquaintance progressing
beyond merest Civilities. This
Disappointment saddened me
to a little Exhibition of Tears
in Front of Hilton, who agrees
with me in Regret, for he and
the Lieutenant are closely
bound by their Position here.
To make the Situation more
distressing, the Osts are our
Neighbors—a scant Half-mile
separates us: no Distance at all
in the Colonies.”
“To my embarrassed Amaze-
ment Mrs. Ost has appeared on
my Threshold twice. I was, of
course, cool to her, and did not
—could not —bring myself to
ask her in. Privacy is a sacred
and precious Necessity. She
and her Savages of Children
were difficult enough to be got
rjd of even from the Doorstep,
for she possesses an uncouth
Stubbornness which could be,
given Opportunity, offensive
and dangerous.”
“However, five Weeks have
passed ; she. has not troubled
me since nor do I expect her to
again. I have discussed the
Matter with myself to the Con-
clusion that it would be
improper to encourage an
Intimacy productive only of
Dilemma and Heartburning,
for we have Nothing in Com-
mon. Indeed, she alarms me by
a malevolent Staring as though
she appraised the Thickness of
my poor Neck with the Eye of
a Tricoteuse at the Guillotine.”
CjO, choosing loneliness,
Ariadne Hilton used up
loneliness alone—pruning and
planting, butter-making and
scrubbing, hammering, chop-
ping, baking, mothering the
cat and the natural creatures of
whom nothing could be
expected except natural
behavior. Piecemeal, and
exhilarated by it, she came to
understand what this or that
cloud intended, how to circum-
vent the wickedness of frost or
willy-willy, how to translate a
wind or soothe a disconcerted
animal. In the candlelight she
played her piano and sang,
darned, embroidered, or read
her poets.
Now and then she filched
time to sketch, but always her
representations of Australian
scenes had an Englishness;
dewy northern greens came
from her paint-box; snow
could fall on her gumtrees dr
crocuses appear under their
oakish outlines. She portrayed
a landscape which existed no*
v/here, a country with a
fluctuating soul set at naught,
Her painted beach was static
and bland, unlike the real one
whose waters even at their most
sensual exhaled a ceaseless
complaint of pain,
If the trees she drew were
sometimes romantically Gothic
that was as far as she saw ; the
trees into which the settlement
fitted like rooms of air in an
enclosure of menace were irre-
vocably imperial, cruelly up-
right, bastions of dread from


\vhose very substance naked
natives advanced meanly and
secretively as children, acrid-
smelling, with carved bellies
and clay-dotted faces. These
were the shoeless and house-
less, whose only cups were the
stinking hands they held out
lor potatoes, sugar and flour—
their toes stealing while hands
demanded from behind a
glistening veil of flies. A race
of hunters with uncontrollable
minds, they could have been
their own earliest ancestors who
left no monument except
bodies to be decorated, muti-
lated and satisfied —no more
than that.
Ariadne Hilton was terrified
of them but would not consent
to show terror, just as for
Martha Ost she was too
disciplined to show distaste.
Martha Ost belonged to a
tribe almost as different from
Ariadne Hilton’s one as the
native tribe was. The two
women were white ; they had
nothing else in common except
a language in which they could
just understand each other
enough to say ... to say what?
'V7 r ET, suddenly, Ariadne
Hilton was compelled by
her own nature and training to
talk with, to entertain daily, for
weeks, the other woman with
her repugnant habits, her pro-
fanities, her searing and deli-
rious giggle, her malicious
glances. Gratitude was an
entertainment Ariadne Hilton
dared not, for the sake of the
truth of her breeding, deny
Martha Ost.
The relation began one
summer evening when the two
husbands were absent at the
main settlement.
All day the silent gongs of
heat had been struck ; the up-
rights of the cliff of overlook-
ing trees had seemed to inter-
fuse like melting glass; all
day, from mid - morning,
cicadas had cynically drilled
the air; all day Ariadne Hilton
had slaved. Before sunset she
had finished her tasks —animals
and birds were fed, the cows
were milked. She-washed her-
self, changed her dress
sprinkling a little Mousseline
Extract on its bosom.
Bonneted, carrying a basket,
her parasol up, she walked the
half-mile to the beach. As she
collected cuttlefish or sponges
for domestic use, the tide-lines
of sea-urchins crushed like
macaroons beneath her sole;
the water was a looking-glass
in which the zenith confronted
its own dispassion.
Her basket filled, she stuck
her parasol in the sand,
unbuttoned her boots, decor-
ously held up skirt and petti-
coats and paddled, singing
songs of the cold country, a
pioneer woman all alone on the
fringe of a mystery-haunted
land. Presently the plaque of
the sun tipped the horizon. At
this touch the sea shivered like
a zither of gilded wires. It was
time to return.
As she stepped from the cool-
ing sand her foot trapped itself
in a hoop of root. She felt a
violent pain as she fell heavily
to the ground. She fainted.
When her eyes opened she
knew there was an arm about
her, she smelled sour sweat,
she heard a voice more terrible
to her than Madame Death’s.
“Mrs. Tlton,” it shrilled. “Ow,
Mrs. Tlton, pray wake, pray
speak.”
It was Martha Ost.
SEVERAL weeks later she
wrote a criss-cross:
“The Ancle was not only
deeply cut, despite my Boot,
but wrenched and enormously
swollen ; I assure you it was
blue as Indigo. I was quite put
about in Matters domestic and
had to call on one of the Men,
who-eould ill spare Time, to
deal with the Farmyard. Most
irksome however is that I am
under Obligation to Mrs. Ost.
As I could not walk unaided
she supported me Home, and
I was constrained to let her
cross the Threshold. Really I
had rather have crawled, and
preserved thus my Privacy.
She, having me disabled,
caused me infinite Distress by
flatly refusing to leave on the
Ground that her Ministrations
were necessary.
“Do not misread me: I am
and must be grateful to the
Creature, and certainly
expressed Gratitude. I gave
her a coral Brooch and Ear-
rings, much treasured though
never worn, intending to indi-
cate net only the Sincerity of
my Thanks but also their
Finality. She has not, either
from Obtuseness or for some
imprudent Purpose of her own,
taken the Hint, and haunts me
daily. Daily ! These unbearable
Intrusions which I must bear
she cannot justify by pleading
Loneliness: she is persona grata
with other Settlers, particularly
with the Wife of one whom
Hilton has had to clap in the
Stocks outside the Barracks for
Inebriation of a violent
Nature.
“Why she pesters me I am
terrified to think, but cannot,
of course, consider being no't
at Home to my Good Samari-
tan and will not give dear over-,
worked Hilton who some-
times finds me weeping after
her Visits —the real Reason
for my Tears. It is a bitter Cup
of Persecution which ultimately
must pass from my Lips but
which, in the Meantime, I
must daily sip.
“O, if you knew how her
Coarseness revolts me and how
I suffer at the Approach of my
Tormentor you would pity me.
I feel that she pretends an added
Coarseness to vex me, for she
can find no Pleasure in my mild
Company unless it be in
frightening me, which is a
corrupt Sport. I do not know
why she has taken this painful
Fancy except in Revenge for
my initial Coolness. I do begin
to fear for my Peace of Mind,
and know the Scar to my
Nature will be more marked
than that on my injured Limb
which has now resumed its
proper Proportions.”
Fearful as she was of the
natives who slid from the infer-
nal twilight of trees to beg with
the arrogance of the mad, she
was more fearful of the dirty,
sniggering woman and her
unbridled children, and desper-
ately employed her useless
defence of manners and con-
trol before an insulting gaze
not to be bought off with
potatoes or flour.
Nothing to do but pour tea
and be gracious, to sugar
despair, to butter increasing
fear.
/~\NE day, as she watched
Martha Ost and her
children approaching, it
suddenly seemed sane to bar

I am going mad, she thought;
I cannot sustain this misery ; I

But her stronger self admon-

door, heard the clock ticking
more slowly as it always did

Swiftly the others were upon
her, buffeting about like beasts.
She smiled, and the distorted

from him, and held it to her
nose, and rolled her eyes,
“La!” she said. “Pretty.”
Ariadne Hilton felt two
badges of hate burn into being

THREE HORSES
The three draught-horses took no notice of me,
As I walked towards them slowly down the hill ;
Just stretched their necks in rest across the fence ,
Moved their heads for comfort, and were still:
Like three old men leaning on a rail,
A small community of quiet thought,
Looking out at nothing but the sunset.
They had the power to break the fence right down
And leap straight forward, but then they would have been
No longer thinkers or masters in that hour.
The fence held them in to a wisdom they had found . . .
There was a stopping-place for every one
Before the end and the beginning out beyond,
And he who did not stop could not sum up
And bring all life to a fence, and with this know
There was no further need at all to leap.
The three old horses did not notice me.

Scientists and Engineers—
Do We Want More?
*tI!7HEN Professor Messel announced
his plan for a Summer School for
Science Teachers as part of a long-range
plan to overcome the shortage of
scientists and technologists in Australia
he said that in this country we must
accept one basic and fundamental fact:
the raising of our standard of living and
the development of our primary and
secondary industries depend upon our
being able to make up by a superior and
advanced technology what we lack in
population.
This problem of shortage of technical
brains is not peculiar to Australia.
Britain and the United States are also
acutely aware of deficiencies in. this
respect. A couple of years ago America
began to survey the actual and potential
position as regards scientific manpower in
Russia and the Western world. Accord-
ing to U.S. Government statements made
last year universities and technical insti-
tutions in Russia were then graduating
engineers in numbers about two-and-a-
half-times greater than were American
institutions. In March, 1956, the Congres-
sional Joint Atomic Committee reported
that the combined total of engineers and
scientists in the United States and 15
Western European nations was about
1,150,000. The Soviet total was 890,000,
which was bigger than America’s and more
than three-quarters that of the whole
Western world. Moreover, it was antici-
pated that in the decade 1950-60 the
Soviet would produce 1,200,000 trained
engineers and scientists, compared with
America’s 900,000.
Experts for Export
Apart from the obvious effect of this
on the productive-capacity of the two
countries, there is another implication, as
U.S. Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles has pointed out. The Soviet’s
capacity to “farm-out” scientists and tech-
nologists to the backward countries of
Asia and Africa may surpass that of
America and the Western Powers.
A Harvard* University research-
associate who has. been studying this
problem wrote in the U.S. “Military
Review” that only half the high-school
graduates who were potential science or
engineering students actually entered the
universities. And of those who did enter,
only half completed the course.
This amounts, in fact, to an 80 per cent,
wastage of potential engineering- and
science-talent. For, of every ten high-school
students with theoretical capacity in science
and engineering, only two actually earn
the degree.
It is rather astonishing for those who
think of America as a mechanised nation
to read that half the U.S. high-schools
teach no physics or chemistry and that
much of the mathematics and science is
taught by teachers untrained in those
fields. Also, that although the numbers
of students in U.S. high schools increased
by 16 per cent, between 1951 and 1956
the number of qualified science-teachers
declined by 53 per cent.
The Harvard researcher felt that a
major cause of the shortage of qualified
men was the economic factor. University
education had become more expensive
and, although there were more scholar-
ships, their buying-power had declined.
It is clear that this aspect of the problem
can be solved only with increased financial
aid from private corporations, the educa-
tional foundations, individual donors and
the Federal and State Governments. Surely,
the Federal Government’s role will have to
be a major one in the provision of
scholarships, teacher-training physical plant.
He also felt something would have to be
done to revive the decreasing interest in
mathematics, chemistry and physics, the
subjects basic to the study of science and
engineering at university level.
In Britain similar concern at the lack
of scientists and technologists has been
expressed, and although the percentage
of university students in these fields rose
from 26 per cent, in 1939 to 34} per cent,
last year it is felt that this is still not
high enough. Last year the U.K. Govern-
ment announced a £lOO-miilion-plan for
technological education.
Australia’s Position
The trained-manpower position is worse
in Australia than in either America or
Britain —and this in a double sense,
because whereas those two countries are
fully-developed industrial nations whose
problem is to maintain and improve their
standards, Australia has only recently
entered the industrial field. It has a big
leeway to make-up and in addition has a
vast programme of development and
immigration making additional demands
on the pool of trained men.
Stressing Australia’s urgent need,
Professor Messel pointed out recently
that although this country, on a per capita
basis, has twice as many university
students as Britain and America
we are turning out on a per capita basis
only half the number of scientists and
technologists as Britain. In relation to
America, one-third; to Russia, a quarter.
Basic Shortage
University enrolments have increased
considerably since 1939 but the percentage
of students studying science and engineer-
ing has declined. “In the University of
Sydney today, we have nearly as many
students entering upon a medical and
pharmacy degree as scientists and
engineers put together—a situation which
surely does not exist in any other notable
country in the world.”
As in America, there is a basic
shortage of science-teachers:
There are about 745 science-teachers in
departmental schools in N.S.W., and of
these only-about half have a science degree.
The Office of Education has estimated that
our Australian schools will require a yearly
intake of about 450 additional mathematics-
and science-teachers during the next few
years—yet in 1956 there was a total output
for all purposes in Australia of only 350
science-graduates.' This can mean only one
thing—rather than alleviating the position
in the schools we can expect a further
decline in the teaching of science and
mathematics and hence a further deteriora-
tion in the scientific- and technological-man-
power problem.
Like the Harvard man, Professor Messel
sees the root of the problem as largely
economic. But he considers the com-
munity’s attitude towards the scientist is
responsible for this —“for instance, our
medical man is looked up to in the
community, yet the scientist and tech-
nologist is mostly subject to indifference
and sometimes almost tQ scorn.” Calling
for a new approach, he says:
Let us not fool ourselves. Science is a
tough discipline and therefore the
encouragements given for one to enter into
it must be high. A salary scale which
treats all professors and/or schoolmasters
alike, however well or badly qualified they
may be, is bound sooner or later to drive
the best professors and schoolmasters from
the profession, leaving it manned entirely
Hr its least useful members ..
But even in industry the rewards* for
scientists and engineers are not so high
as might be expected in an age* of tech-
nological progress.
A survey of professional incomes con-
ducted by the Melbourne University
Appointments Board showed that the
highest-paid professions in Victoria were
Medicine, Dentistry and Law. Among
the lowest - paid were Engineering,
Chemistry, Physics and Agricultural
Science. It must be assumed that that is
the community’s assessment of the rela-
tive importance of the professions. Is it a
good one? A healthy mind in a healthy
body is a good ideal for a man or a
nation, but over-preoccupation with
bodily ills is not usually considered praise-
worthy. Are we becoming a nation of
valetudinarians?
At the annual convention of the Royal
Australian Chemical Institute speaker
after speaker commented on the poor
inducements offered to scientists in com-
parison with other professions and of the
difficulty of keeping ambitious young
graduates in Australia. They deplored
the attitude of Australian industry which
spent very little on research and “put
scientists on a level with clerks and sales-
men as far as pay was concerned.” The
convention decided to ask the Prime
Minister to appoint a committee to
examine science-teaching in Australia and
to recommend ways of increasing the
supply of scientists.
The lesson of all this seems to be that
although there is general agreement that
the country needs more scientists and
engineers, the community is not yet willing
to pay the price of getting them. Pro-
fessor Messel is probably right in suggest-
ing that unless the community reassesses
its values it may expect not only to find it
difficult “to hold the few good scientists
and technologists we have, but to lose in
ever greater numbers our best upcoming
young men as well,”


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
T he Horses—Sydney
VETERAN owner E. A.
Haley was at Rosehill to
see his three-year-old Tulloch
easily win the Guineas from
Prince Darius and Turkestan,
and he now looks forward to
his greatest ambition —a Derby
success. The remarkably con-
sistent Tulloch has had 15 starts
for nine wins and six seconds,
tallying £21,107 in stakes. He
was secured by his trainer, T. J.
Smith, in New Zealand in
January, 1956, for 750gns.
• •• 9j •
Tulloch’s sire, Khorassan
(imp.), a son of Big Game, won
in England to a mile-and-a-
half ; while his dam, Florida,
by Salmagundi (imp.), was
successful in New Zealand to
11 furlongs and was placed
at 12 furlongs. Since he is
easy to ride, and so capable of
taking up any desired position
in a race, Tulloch should be
untroubled by the 12 furlongs
of the Derby.
• • • •
Though Turkestan finished
only third to Tulloch in the
Rosehill Guineas, trainer
Gordon Brown is hopeful his
colt will fit well into the Derby
pictt*re. Brown, from long
experience, knows what is
required of a horse in staying
events. One of his best,
Murray Stream, twice won the
Metropolitan. Turkestan’s sire,
Turkaris (imp.), won twice in
England at 12 furlongs, while
his grandsire, Turkhan, won
the Irish Derby and finished
second in the English classic.
The colt’s dam, Tregazza, is by
Le Grand Due (Fr.) from
Delta’s dam, Gazza. On breed-
ing Turkestan should run the
Derby distance right out.
• • • •
The Rosehill meeting next
Saturday will be the last city
fixture before the opening of
the A.J.C. spring carnival,
which could prove one of the
most successful for years.
Redcraze, in winning the
the weight-for-age Hill Stakes
at Rosehill last spring, ran the
8£ furlongs in 1.43 9/10, which
is the fastest time since the
distance was changed in 1941.
Redcraze, again among the
nominations for next Satur-
day’s race, defeated Somerset
Fair and Empire Link. Somer-
set Fair had won the Hill
Stakes the previous year.
In previous seasons the Hill
Stakes has been won by such
grand performers as Phar Lap,
Chatham, Peter Pan, Gold
Rod and Limerick—all five
had dual success. More
recently, Redcraze, Prince
Cortauld, Hydrogen, Bernbor-
ough and Shannon added the
Hill Stakes money to the
thousands they won in stakes.
• • • t
While nominations for this
year’s event include Landy,
Teranyan, Monte Carlo, Baron
Boissier, Cambridge, Zariba,
Caranna, Tulloch, Todman and
Young Idealist, it’s difficult, at
time of writing, to say which
“Missed!"
of them will face the starter.
But it’s a sure bet that those
left in will provide a winner
worthy of the tradition of the
race.
On the same programme
further guides should be
found to Epsom and Metro-
politan prospects from the run-
ning of the seven-furlongs
Theo Marks Quality Handicap
and the mile-and-a-quarter
Rosehill Cup.
Grand Charles galloped his
way into the A.J.C. Metropoli-
tan picture with a stylish win
in the Rosehill Handicap,
running a race-record for
the 10 furlongs. The big chest-
nut has 7.8 in the Randwick
contest, lib. less than he
carried at Rosehill ; he could
be dangerous if N. Sellwood
again has the mount. Sell-
wood got the best from Grand
Charles at the Hill: he came
from a rearward position to
win running away.
• .•]
A few weeks ago not many
form students would have con-
sidered six-year-old Prince
Jambo an A.J.C. Epsom hope:
he had been regarded as a
smart sprinter, with ability up
to seven furlongs. He may yet
find eight furlongs too far on
Epsom day, but he has raced
himself right into the market
for the big mile with con-
sistently good form.
• 9 9] 9'
Since July 27 Prince Jambo
has had five starts for three
wins and two seconds, his
successes at six furlongs only.
Strongest Epsom pointer was
his neck second, at w.f.a. with
8.12, to Tulloch in the Warwick
Stakes. On Saturday he
carried 9.5, and drops to 8.3
in the Randwick mile. How-
ever, looking at the Rosehill
Flying, it is likely that My
Kingdom (third) will also come
into the Epsom picture (he was
blocked at a critical stage), as
will fourth horse Teranyan
(much better off at a mile than
at six).
• •! '•] •
Gallant Lee, easy winner of
the £3OOO 11-furlongs New-
castle Cup, with 7.7 (which
included 21b. over), has 7.2, or
21b. above the limit, in the
A.J.C. Metropolitan. He looks
a lightweight show, especially
should the going be on. the slow
side. Winner of several events
last season, Gallant Lee is a
good - type middle - distance
galloper. In June he won in
runaway style at Randwick,
over 10 furlongs on a dead
track.
• '•] '») •
This time last year a colt
named Tulloch won a
Randwick two-year-old barrier-
trial by 10 lengths. D. Segen-
field, owner of the T. J. Smith-
trained The Wensum, wouldn’t
mind if his speedy Newtown
Wonder (imp.) gelding proved
another Tulloch —The Wensum
the other day won his Rand-
wick two-year-old barrier-trial
by 10 lengths, and ran 48.15ec.,
l/10sec, outside the best for
the session, run by another
quick Newtown Wonder geld-
ing, New Dapto (to be raced by
his breeder, D. Chrystal). As
usual, trainer Smith has his
two-year-olds well forward in
race condition; he looks cer-
tain to figure in the early
juvenile stakemoney, on offer
from the first week in October.
•] :•] •
The 15 Randwick trials
included the usual mixture of
high and moderately priced
youngsters. One winner,
Mighty Kingdom (raced by
Adolph Basser), cost 5000gns.
—equal top price at the
Randwick auction. The colt is
i>y Star Kingdom (imp.) from
Rare Pleasure. Generally, the
two-year-olds didn’t appear to
have the potential of last
year’s batch (now the best
three-year-olds for many
seasons); but, with youngsters,
first impressions can be
misleading.

Results of the Randwick
trials indicated from the
feminine angle that the M.
McCarten-trained Cherry Bank,
Bright Apple (trained by T. J.
Smith) and Demanica (H. T,
Walsh puts the polish on her),
might quickly show to advan-
tage in races. Cherry Bank is
by Bob Cherry, who is getting
quite a number of winners;
she ran her heat in 48 9/10,
Bright Apple took a second
longer; Demanica ran 49J,
Bright Apple and Demanica
are by Newtown Wonder,
whose two-year-olds are noted
for speed. An interesting trial-
winner was Leaflet, to be raced
by Dr. John Gearin and Jack
O’Riordan. This filly, trained
by Peter Lawson, is by
Emperor (Fr.) from Leaf by
Hua. She was bred 1 by Dr.
and Mrs. Gearin and reared
at Sledmere Stud, Scone.

In the six years it has been

scored in 1953. Bill Williamson
won on Fetlar in 1952. Oddly

Sydney jockeys Sellw o o d,
Moore, Thompson and Weir
have accepted mounts. Out-
standing Victorian apprentice
Geoff Lane, who has ridden
over a hundred winners in the
metropolitan area, will be
pitted against the senior riders.

The £2OOO w.-f.-a. Under-
wood Stakes is on the same
programme; unless Sailor’s
Guide accepts, which, at time
of writing, seems most unlikely,
Syntax should be untroubled to
win.
♦’ •’ *' •
The most disappointing
performance turned - in at
Flemington last Saturday was
that of the four-year-old
Queensland gelding Book Link
in the mile-and-a-half Septem-
ber Handicap. The race
attracted only seven starters,
and none of them, apart from
Book Link, had any claims to
be a Cup horse. Racegoers
freely laid odds-on the Queens-
lander, who seemed likely to
repay that confidence when he
ran to the front halfway up
the straight. However, he gave
in meekly when challenged by
Andonni, an aged gelding who
has never been more than a
winter handicapper. On that
run Book Link would seem to
have little chance in any of the
important spring handicaps.
• • • •
Sailor’s Guide had little
more than an exercise gallop
to win his second successive
Craiglee Stakes at Flemington
last Saturday. Syntax did not
accept for the race, and
“Sailor’’ was the only genuine
weigh t-for-age horse in the
small field. Nevertheless, the
manner in which he trounced
such opposition as there was
confirmed the impression he
gave at Caulfield when narrowly
defeated by Syntax—that he is
probably a better horse now
than ever before.
By the same token, it
becomes more apparent that
the New Zealand champion is
a mighty galloper. The opinion
was freely expressed at Flem-
ington after the Craiglee that
Syntax would not again defeat
Sailor’s Guide —a view not
held by this writer. Their next
clash is likely to be in the
Turnbull Stakes at Flemington
on October 5.
His win in the Craiglee took
Sailor’s Guide’s stake-winnings
to £48,494, gained from 13
wins and 26 minor pjacings in
44 starts ; only Redcraze, of
horses still racing, has won
more.
• • • •
Fighting Force, well favored
for the Melbourne Cup, ran a
fair race in the Craiglee. He
was forced to lead in the
middle stages of the race, and
was just beaten out of a place.
An out-and-out handicapper,
he will not lose any friends on
the run.
• •, •
The heavy track at Fleming-
ton made the 10 furlongs of
the Burleigh Handicap a solid
staying test for three-year-olds
engaged. Surprisingly, the
race went to Starry Eyes, who
had shown his best form over
sprint distances. Riding to the
instructions of owner Dave
Whiteside, Geoff Lane held
Starry Eyes back in the field
until heads were furned for
home. Given rein, the colt
finished with great dash to win
comfortably. Starry Eyes is a
Caulfield Guineas and Victoria
Derby nomination, but despite
last Saturday’s win he will
confound breeding students if
he reveals enough stamina to
win the Derby. His sire,
Smokey Eyes (imp.), found six
furlonjjs as much as he could
manage. Hot favorite.in the
Burleigh, Tuki, who had been
rated one of Victoria’s best
Derby prospects, put in a bad
run to finish out of a place. He
would have to show great
improvement to warrant a
Derby start.

Albhry studmasters Messrs.
A. E. and J. P. Wallace had
good reason to be elated over
the success of Dight’s Hill in
the six-furlongs Exford Handi-
cap at Flemington. They bred
the colt, who is named after
their property, and they bred
his dam, Miss Persia. The
winner, whose main mission
during the spring is the Caul-
field Guineas, showed tons of
speed to defeat a strong field
by four lengths. Second place-
getter Western District was
successful at his last start, in
open company, which speaks
well of Dight’s Hill’s ability.
The colt has all the brilliance
required of a Guineas winner,
but he may find the last two
furlongs of the rich Caulfield
race too much for him ;
especially against the calibre
of horse that should be about
in this year’s event.
S. G. Morgan, 'owner of
Tudor Hill, impressive winner
of the 10-furlongs Kingsford
Highweight at Flemington, is
an English businessman who
has seen his horse race only
once last January, when
Tudor Hill beat Hellespride to
the post and lost the race bn
protest. He has promised
trainer N. A. Francis that if
Tudor Hill’s form warrants a
Caulfield Cup start he will fly
out for the race: he looks like
making the trip. Saturday’s
win was Tudor Hill’s third
from his last five starts.
Capably handled by Alan Yeo-
mans, the Ottoman horse
finished very strongly to win
the Kingsford running away.
He drops from 8.11 to 7.6
in the Caulfield Cup, and while
the opposition he will meet in
the Cup is altogether different
from a Highweight field, Tudor
Hill has at least earned a start
at Caulfield.

On Saturday Melbourne
racing goes to Moonee Valley,
where the feature race will be
the rich Moonee Valley Stakes
—a mile event, in which colts
and geldings carry 8.9, fillies
8.4. All the Victorian classic
hopes are included in /the
nominations, as is the flying
Adelaide filly, Cherete.
If she can reproduce her
autumn form, Cherete, who
has won eight races straight,
should again prove too nippy
for the colts. The race will be
Good Summer's test for the
A.J.C. Derby.

The Tasmanian Racing Club
backed a winner, it seems,
when it permitted a drive-in
theatre company to operate on
the inside of its Elwick race-
course. The company, which
began operations about a year
ago, had to July 31 last paid
£2123 in rent. The club’s
annual report stated that with-
out the drive-in the year would
have proved costly, as opera-
tions over the last financial year
resulted in an £ll excess of
expenditure over receipts. The
Apple Isle club, spurred by a
live-wire executive and a smart
secretary in Brian Osborne, is
first in with a sideline that may
well interest a few mainland

Needing the win to qualify
him for the £5OOO Spring Cup,
to be run on Oct. 19, King
Ranji, the black horse from the
bush, took on a tidy field of
pacers in the. Harold Park
Handicap, and beat them in a
manner that will have earned
him many supporters for the
big race. No horse could be
more workmanlike: when he
is about to mow down a half-
dozen rivals with a scorching
sprint there is no preliminary
toss of the head or high-step-
ping action ; he knuckles to the
task with a low, sweeping
stride ; the nose that carries the
sunburnt shadow-blind
ominous.

Football Round-up
T* EQUIRING no more polish
than they’ve had in the
majority of matches through-
out this season, St. George
dominated their S.C.G. grand-
final against Manly 31-9, and
showed-off to 54,399 Rugby
League fans a pack of for-
wards that has old-timers
reckoning hard to remember
the like of it. The St. George
XIII is, in fact, probably the
best club side at its code in the
world. (The premiership was
the Saints’ fourth —their previ-
ous in 1941, 1949 and 1956.)
r .... .Before a crowd of 100,324,
Melbourne, with its greater all-
round strength, easily bombed
Essendon by 61 points (17.14-
7.13), to win the V.F.L. grand-
final and its third successive
premiership. The Demons
convincingly reversed the
Bombers’ win in the second
semi-final. Melbourne is the
first club to win three-times-
running twice ; its previous trio
were 1939-40-41 Playing
their third grand-final in the
last four seasons, the St.
George Rugby Union team
won Sydney’s Rugby Union
premiership for the first time,
with a 21-3 victory over
Gordon, last year’s premiers.
It has been, in all, a big year
in sport for the St. George
district.
On the Wallabies
With the usual post-mortems
over, and Bob Davidson and
his youthful team now well on
the way to Europe, followers
of the old code look forward
with interest to the opening
matches of the English tour.
Much has been said about
the kinds of grounds over
there, and many think that
most of the games will be
played in slush and rain—con-
ditions detrimental to the type
of Rugby played by Aus-
tralians on tour in N.Z. or
South Africa ; but it would be
quite wrong to imagine that the
English winter is always wet or
that the fields are incessantly
muddy or frozen. South of the
Midlands, especially, early
winter can give week after
week of ideal conditions for
fast open Rugby, and presum-
ably it is here that the
Wallabies will get their land-
legs. Up north, it will probably
be different, and there will no
doubt be plenty of heavy ruck-
work and few chances for
speedy wingers to do their
stuff.
As to the opposition the
Wallabies will meet, it is sure
to be tough. Ruby Union is at
its numerical top in both
England and Scotland. In
England there are more than
twice the number playing the
game now as were playing
in 1945 ; and the Union code
has made strong headway in
the north, traditional home of
the League game, which, in
England, is not played outside
that area.
In Scotland and Ireland the
game has also gained in
strength. Last year the Scots-
men were considered to have
slipped in the standard of their
play, but they brought home a
shock to their critics by defeat-
ing a national French side
when they met them towards
the end of the season in Paris.
The Welshmen are always
capable of putting a dangerous
XV in the field, although of
late they seem to have lacked
the galaxy of stars which at
times has placed them at the
head of the Rugby world ; and
across the Irish Sea there are
plenty of young players of
promise who may produce
some surprises when they meet
the Wallabies.

Some details of the Australian
Army’s subsidy plan for medical
undergraduates ?
The Army has a plan under which
it will pay Service salaries, approved
tutorial fees and fees for lectures,
demonstrations and examinations,
supplying, as well, some textbooks
and instruments on loan, to medical
undergraduates prepared to serve for
a short period in the Royal Aus-
tralian Army Medical Corps. Under-
graduates are eligible to apply for
the subsidy if they will be taking the
first, second or third clinical-year
course in 1958. Until the comple-
tion of the resident-year, Army ser-
vice is not required of them, except
for a course of about two weeks at
the School of Army Health, Heales-
ville, Victoria, in January each year.
Those entering the scheme during
their first or second clinical years
will be appointed lieutenants. They
will be required to serve for four
years as medical officers in the
Regular Army, after the completion
of their hospital resident-year. On
commencing the resident-year
officers are promoted to the rank of
captain. Applications will also be
accepted from undergraduates who
will begin their hospital resident-year
in 1958. Those selected will be
commissioned with the rank of
captain. They will be required to
serve for two years after their
resident-year. A commission in the
R.A.A.M.C. offers opportunity of
service in Australia and overseas as
a regimental medical officer, or in a
hospital. Provision is made for
attendance at civilian hospitals and
clinics during military service and
for refresher-training after comple-
tion of service. Applications, which
close on Nov. 15, should be
addressed to the Army Command
Headquarters in the applicant’s
home State, where further particulars
may be obtained.

I understand there was a sport of
“bull-leaping v in the ancient world.
Is this so ?
Several of the frescoes unearthed
by Sir Arthur Evans at the palace of
Knossos (Crete) showed “bull-leap-
ing” by the Minoans, the inhabitants
oi ancient Crete. The representa-
tions picture acrobats grabbing tne
horns of a charging bull, using the
horn as a purchase and then back-
somersaulting on to the back of the
Lull. Some of the acrobats shown
performing are girls. Modem
investigators are sceptical. To quote
Leonard Cottrell, in The Bull of
Minos (1953), “Professor Baldwin
Brown showed the pictures to a
veteran ‘steer-wrestler’ from the
American Far West, who refused
to believe that it could be done.
‘You couldn’t catch hold of the
bull’s horns for the start of the
somersault,’ he said, ‘for there’s no
chance of a human person being
able to obtain a balance when the
bull is charging full against him.’
The bull, he added, is three times
as strong as a steer, and, when run-
ning, ‘raises his head sideways and
gores anyone in front of him.’ ”
Cottrell points out that, as no one
has put the matter to a test, the
mystery of the “bull-leaping”
lemains one.

Details of the overseas engineering
scholarships offered by the Federa-
tion of British Industries?
The Federation of British Indus-
tries, in co-operation with the
Federal Government, offers scholar-
ships providing practical training
for selected Australian engineering
graduates and diplomates in indus-
trial works in the U.K. Candidates
must be graduates or diplomates in
engineering of recognised uni-
versities or technical colleges and
must, if selected for an award,
undertake to return to Australia
within six months of completion
ol training, to practise their pro-
fession in Australia for at least
three years.
The scholarships are of
three types. Type “A” and “B”
scholarships are designed for
recently qualified engineers with not
more than two years’ practical or
industrial experience, including
experience gained during their
engineering course. Applications
are also invited from final-year
students who expect to qualify for
a degree or diploma at the end of
the year and whose practical experi-
ence does not exceed two years.
During the two-year scholarship
period the scholar receives practical
training with a firm or industrial
undertaking engaged on the type of
work in which he seeks experience.
Scholars are not paid by the firms,
but receive from the Federation a
maintenance allowance of £5426 per
annum; this allowance covers the
ordinary cost of living of an un-
married scholar.
Type “A” scholarships also cover
cost of travel to and from the U.K.
and the payment of a shipboard-
allowance of 10s. per day. Type
“B” scholars must pay the cost of
their passages from and to Aus-
tralia. They do not receive a ship-
board - allowance. Type “C”
scholarships are for more experi-
enced applicants with not less than
five years’ industrial or practical
experience. They provide training
tor from six to twelve months and
the major part of living expenses.
They are designed for the benefit of
practising engineers whose
employers, whether public or
private organisations or Govern-
ment departments, are willing to
release them temporarily and
support their applications. While in
training, type “C” scholars receive a
maintenance-allowance of £SSOO per
annum, to which they are required
to contribute, before leaving Aus-
tralia, at the rate of £SIOO per
annum. Type “C” scholars must
pay the cost of their travel to and
from the U.K.
General conditions of the
scholarships: living allowances are
payable from the date of arrival in
the U.K. and end with the scholar’s
departure, provided this takes place
within a reasonable time after the
completion of training; payments
are made monthly, in advance, and
are free of income tax in the U.K.;
scholars are entitled, while in
Britain, to free medical treatment
under the National Health Insurance
Scheme; other things being equal,
priority will be given to single
scholars (where married scholars are
recommended, they will be
required to produce evidence of
private means adequate to maintain
their families during the whole
period of the scholarship). All
applications must be made on a
prescribed form (in triplicate),
copies of which may be obtained
from the Australian Selection Com-
mittee, F. 8.1. Overseas Scholarships
Scheme, c/o Commonwealth
Office of Education, Commonwealth
Bank Building, York and Market
Streets, Sydney (Box 3879, G.P.0.,
Sydney). Applications, together with
three certified copies of the
candidate’s academic record, must
reach the committee by October 25,
1957.
Brief Answers
Widower: Probate-duty and
Federal estate-duty depend to a
large extent upon the class of per-
sons who would normally succeed
to the estate (whether widows,
children or strangers) and also to
some extent on the situation of the
property. If you can give these
details, we can answer your ques-
tion ; but even then, only

crete floors must be suspect in
regard to sweating or damp, but the

Justice Clyne, who conducted an
inquiry in 1944-45 on the Australia
First cases, it was “difficult to resist
the conclusion, however strange it
may seem, that they were planning
tc assist the Japanese who were
threatening to invade Australia.”
The arrests of the 16 in N.S.W.
were “justified,” said Mr. Justice
Clyne, but more caution should have
been exercised and a proper
investigation immediately instituted.
Mr. Justice Clyne found that there
was no reason whatever for the
detention of eight of the N.S.W.
men, and in his judgment stated
that each of these eight men was
entitled to compensation, plus “a
public declaration that they were
in fact wrongly detained and were
not disloyal/’ The detention of
eight other N.S.W. men and a Vic-
torian was justified, his Honor
held. (2) Among other references,

the same, 20. If, however, he plays,
say, 30 innings for 600 runs, his
Test-average remains the same, 20,
but his total runs have risen to 600.
In your lottery question, if you buy
only one lottery-ticket, your total
chance of winning the lottery is one,
with your average chance one in
100,000. Each one more ticket you

As the following comment

points appears to be the British
industry’s inability to deliver
the Bristol Britannia in suffi-
cient numbers to satisfy both
home and U.S. orders.

every long flight, there comes a
point of no-return, when a
pilot must go on because he no
longer has enough fuel to turn
back. Aviation in Britain has
reached such a point, set on a
course from which there can be
no retreat. It is a course that
not only leads across the tech-
nical gulf that separates
manned aircraft from missiles,
but into a region of less Govern-
ment finance for aircraft and
more Government criticism;
less home-support and more
international competition ; but
also less outside interference
and more freedom of action. It
may be the kind of stimulus
that the industry has needed to
lift it out of the discouraging
doldrums of the middle nine-
teen-fifties. In some parts of
the industry— not all—it is
already taking effect.”

develop no new fighters or
bombers, but to concentrate
exclusively on guided-missiles,

at the stroke of a pen, for new

production. It means that huge
factories will be left totally
empty when their present

31st ANNUAL REPORT
THE GAS SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED
1957
REPORT OF DIRECTORS
The Company’s affairs are in a very sound condition. During the year
the Branches which have been operated for many years have progressed, and
improved; the Branches taken over in recent years have had many
improvements carried out; and we have recently taken over the Hamilton
Gas Co., Ltd., in Victoria.
Although a good deal of effort has necessarily been diverted to the work
of improving the recently acquired Branches, the results of the Company,
as a whole, show the progress that has been made over all Branches.
I Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet:
The consolidated accounts, which include the financial record and progress
of all of the Company’s affairs, show the following results:
The increase in the profit, before
tax, to £180,839 from £150,331 is
very satisfactory, as the Capital
increased by only £20,265. This
Capital increase is due to the shares
issued to complete the transfer of
the Ballarat and Bundaberg Com-
panies and to the issue in exchange
for shares in the Hamilton
Company.
The proportion of assets in each
State is now—Queensland, 31% ;
blew South Wales, 22% ; Victoria,
47 <v
In spite of the increase in all costs
for Plant and Distribution, the total
Capital invested per 1,000 cubic feet
ol gas sold is 20% less than at the
pre-war date of 30th June, 1939.
Reference to the Statistical Review
on page 8 will best illustrate the
Company’s progress. It will be seen
that over the. past five years:
Shareholders’ Funds have
increased by £532,772 = 75%.
Total Assets have increased by
£1,092,835 = 91%.
Net Profits, after tax, have
increased by £59,580 = 129%.
It is satisfying to note that the
proposed appropriation to Reserve
Account has risen to £25,000 for the
year, after providing £75,000 for
Income Tax.
Other than as mentioned, the
results of the Company’s operations
have not been materially affected in
any abnormal manner.
SALES:
Sales of gas (excluding Hamilton)
were 3% ahead of last year. Sales of
appliances and residuals were also
well ahead of any previous year.
In industry, gas increases in
popularity. Bakery firms have
installed conveyor-type ovens for
bread baking after investigating the
merits of electricity and oil. These
ovens have consumptions up to
1,500 cu. ft. per hour, and an output
of 750 loaves per hour. The demand
for this type of equipment is grow-
ing and orders are in hand for a
number of ovens at various centres.
In motels and drive-in theatres,
gas is the popular fuel, and gas
equipment for cooking, water heat-
ing and space heating has been
selected.
Industrial organisations, including
heavy industry, have installed several
gas-fired furnaces for a variety of
purposes, such as —the drying of
sand moulds and earthenware
pipes; the heat treatment of steel;
the degreasing of metal; heating of
crucible and muffle furnaces;
biscuit tin drying; as well as space
heating. Many industrial and com-
mercial heating problems are solved
by designing special gas burning
equipment.
In the domestic field, gas con-
tinues to progress, as household
appliances are being' constantly
improved. In our areas of supply
in all States, we install gas in prac-
tically all houses built by the Hous-
ing Authorities —a recent example
being at Cairns, where 84 Commis-
sion houses were each equipped with
a Gas Cooker, Bath Heater and
Wash Copper.
In addition to the increasing
numbers of residential customers,
the large number of commercial,
cooking and heating appliances
installed in hospitals, schools, cafes
and hotels gives us confidence in the
future development of all Branches.
The residuals, Coke and Tar, con-
tinue in strong demand.
HAMILTON:
In April an offer was made to the
Hamilton Gas Co., Ltd., to exchange
its Issued Capital of 12,200 Ordinary
Shares for 12,200 Fixed 6% Cumula-
tive Preference Shares in The Gas
Supply Co., Ltd. This offer was
accepted by all shareholders, and the
Company is now operated as a sub-
sidiary. The Hamilton Company’s
accounts are included in the con-
solidated accounts now published.
A fair amount of capital will need
to be spent to rehabilitate the under-
taking and extend its activities, but
increased sales and revenue are
assured because Hamilton is the
centre of a very wealthy district of
Victoria, and has a population of
9,000 people. In due course, this
acquisition will add strength to the
Company.
PLANTS AND DISTRI-
BUTION SYSTEMS:
With increasing sales of gas, it is
necessary to be continually enlarg-
ing the capacity of plants and
extending mains and providing
services and meters. Most Branches
have shared in this, but the main
projects have been the provision of
a complete new carbonising plant
at Bundaberg, the final cost of which
will be about £70,000; the com-
mencement of a new 500,000 cubic
feet capacity Storage Holder at
Ballarat, which will cost about
£90,000 and extensions to the exist-
ing gas making plant at Broken Hill
costing about £20,000.
It will be necessary to provide
further capital in the near future to
take care of the expansion of the
Company’s business.
EMPLOYEES:
Our future success depends on the
quality of people in our organisa-
tion, and we are fortunate in having
throughout tlje Company a very high
proportion of employees who are
keen, loyal and competent and who
share a great pride in the reputation
and progress of The Gas Supply
Co., Ltd. The results we are able
to report to you have only been
achieved through the united efforts
of employees at all Branches, and 1
am glad to have this opportunity of
expressing your thanks to them.
- The Provident Fund continues to
grow. There are now 270 members
and the invested funds amount to
£135,000. In addition, members are
insured for £46,000 in the Provident
Fund Group Insurance Scheme.
Fighty-one employees are share-
holders in the Company.
THE GAS INDUSTRY:
It is not perhaps generally known
that the Gas Industry is one of the
steadily increasing industries in Aus-
tralia. The Capital invested amounts
to £75 million, and the number of
separate holdings of shares and
debentures is 70,000.
The number of customers using
gas in Australia is approximately
1,300,000, and the Gas sold to these
customers increases year by year at a
fairly steady rate.
THE FUTURE:
The Company’s business continues
to prosper and increase and we look
forward to this being continued in
the future.
For and on behalf of the Board,
R. A. SCHUCHARD,
Chairman.


Guardian”: “Since the war,
only three types of British
transport aeroplane the
Viking, the Bristol 170, and the
Viscount —have so far been
sold in any numbers to civil
operators. Of the three success-
ful British airliners, only the
Viscount was of sufficiently
advanced design when it
appeared to be fully competitive
with contemporary American
types. As a result, it has sold
in numbers similar to those
of the most successful American
aircraft.”
• •*- • •
The same: “It is now clear
that the first was the most
important and fundamental of
our [Britain’s] mistakes. The
proposition that we could ‘leap-
frog the opposition’ completely
ignored the basic fact that
satisfactory . transport aero-
planes can be produced only
by a long, slow process of
progressive development and
design evolution. Steps forward
in basic design, when they have
to be made, should not be too
revolutionary nor involve too
many innovations. From bitter
experience, airline operators are
conservative people. Trans-
port - aircraft manufacturers
must also blend conservatism
with their natural enthusiasm
for technical innovation. The
other mistakes which we made
followed largely from the first.”
# * *
London “Daily Telegraph ” :
“The British aircraft industry
has led the world for many
years in the production of pro-
totypes, but has too often fallen
behind in putting the new
machines into service whether
military or civilian. What is
most badly needed in the
British aircraft industry is not
ingenious ideas, of which there
are plenty, but a competent and
single-minded organisation to
translate the good ideas into
saleable products before the
good ideas become obsolete.”
Cost of Suez
The cost of clearing Suez
(estimated at $8,600,000) is up
for debate in the U.N.
Assembly, although, comments
Edinburgh “Scotsman,” Egypt
already has “a simple solution
to the whole problem, namely,
that whoever pays it will not be
Egypt”:
“But against this must be set
the fact that it was Egypt that
blocked the canal and that there
was no necessity for her to
do this. Egypt holds Britain
and France responsible for
blocking the canal, and one of
her suggestions is that they
should pay for the damage.
“Another idea is that an
increase in the transit dues, for
a temporary period, would
meet the cost. This would be
to put the burden on the
shipping-lines and merchants
who in no sense caused the
Suez crisis or desired that the
canal should be blocked.
Besides, surcharges on tolls,
thus encouraged, might become
an unwelcome feature of future
Egyptian financial policy.”
Largely in agreement with
— N. Y. "Herald Tribune ”
HARVEST MOON
that comment, London “Daily
Telegraph” adds that the bill
has “been paid already, but this
happy circumstance, instead of
solving the problem, has
bedevilled it” :
“Ten shipping countries
including the United States, but
neither Britain nor France —
contributed $10,822,000 as a
loan for this purpose. The
total bill is unlikely to come
to more than $9 million.. So
there is a surplus which will
have to be repaid, presumably
in proportion to the original
contributions.
“The Egyptian press is once
more calling for the total cost
to be debited to the ‘aggressor
countries,’ who were ‘respon-
sible for blocking the canal.’
But if one point in this tangled
and controversial history is
certain, it is that the ‘aggressor
countries’ were not in any way
responsible for blocking the
canal. That was a decision
taken by Nasser himself, and it
was carried out with a
thoroughness which far sur-
passed the limits of what even
the most pro-Egyptian nations
can have thought necessary.
Among the ships sunk were the
dredgers essential to keeping the
canal. in good working order.
It is hard to resist the con-
clusion that Nasser was trying,
by a kind of Luddite re-
insurance policy, to protect his
new canal company from
criticisms of incompetence.
“However the cost may ulti-
mately be spread, the Egyptian
suggestion that a 10 per cent,
surcharge should be added to
canal dues is both cynical and
aggressive. Nasser must be well
aware that the bulk of this levy
will have to be borne by
British shipowners, who pay 40
per cent, of the existing tolls.
From the long-term point of
view, all users of the canal
must reflect that it is much
easier to impose a surcharge of
this kind than to remove it.
Egypt will advance every
possible excuse for retaining it
permanently.”
Russia's Rocket
In what is possibly the most
excruciating pun of the week,
“Manchester Guardian”
describes the Russian claim to
a ballistic rocket of intercon-
tinental range as “flexing a
missile”:
“If the Moscow reports are
true—and in the past they have
generally proved to contain the
seeds of truth, although clothed
in careful ambiguities—then
the firing shows that the
Russians are well forward in
research.”
The Russian claim, the paper
adds, could be at most “a warn-
ing that the Soviet Government
may have batteries of long-
range rockets perhaps three
years before the United States.
Even so, that does not end the
strategic stalemate”:
“The deterrent has not gone
up in smoke, nor will do so
when the Soviet batteries are
ready. It will continue until
one side or the other has
enough weapons of assured
accuracy, to blot out all, or
nearly all, its opponent’s means
of retaliation.
“For Russia, today, that
would call for enough
bombers or missiles to
neutralise immediately the
American bases throughout the
world, the British bases in these
[British] islands and in Cyprus,
and the carrier forces of the
Sixth and Seventh Fleets in the
Mediterranean and the Pacific.
“It means striking simultane-
ously at points as far apart as
Dhahran in Saudi Arabia,
Thule in the Arctic Circle, and
El Paso in Texas. Further, it
means locating fleets at sea and
putting their chief units out of
action. It is a military task of
immense magnitude. Unless an
attacker could be sure of
accomplishing it, his homeland
would be open to devastating
attack from one quarter or
another.”
Diamonds and
Colonialism
Ramifications of diamond-
mining and -marketing being
what they are, it is possibly
not altogether surprising that
the discovery of rich and exten-
sive fields in Sierra Leone —“a
few days’ hard work can bring
the reward of a handful of
stones worth several thousand
pounds” (Frank Harvey in
London “Daily Telegraph”)—
should be bringing the colony
as much trouble as affluence.
The diamonds can be found

We are living in days of amazingly rapid
change. And that, after all, is to be expected.
Every growing thing changes during its life.
Even the inanimate objects around us are being
constantly remoulded by Nature or transformed
by the actions of Man.
When I was talking in Sydney to Dr.
Lundquist, the Swedish economist, during his visit
to Australia he used an arresting term to describe
this process: he called it “destructive creation.”
It means that everything in this world is
subject to change. The old gives place to the new.
To cite a purely material example: coal is burnt
and produces power for industry, oil is consumed
in an engine and provides us with tractive energy;
and so on.
This “destroying to create” is one of the laws
of life, and the interesting point is that it does
not dissipate strength but actually makes it.
As an instance of the quick changes that have
taken place in our time, look at how the whole
concept Of Defence has been altered by production
of the atom bomb. Defence no longer means the
maintaining of vast standing armies.
And —here is a compensating factor—trained
technical men can be released from the armed
forces of many nations to supplement manpower in
creative industry.
I mention this in passing, because it seems
very important to me that Australia should be
making the utmost use of her skilled manpower
and adding to their numbers wherever possible.
It so happens that just when the pace of life
everywhere is accelerating under the changes
brought by modem discovery, the true extent of
Australia’s wealth-potential is beginning to be
revealed. Only, the best employment of our human
resources will suffice to meet that double demand.
In all things in this country the future is going
to depend on our ability to address ourselves to
Change; on the way in which we meet it, welcome
it for the impelling force it is, and rise to its
great opportunities.

illicit miners can easily cross
the borders to ready markets
for smuggled gems ; and these
conditions, comments the
“D.T.” editorially, “have caused
a ‘diamond-rush’ against which
the Sierra Leone Selection
Trust [a subsidiary of the Con-
solidated African Trust] has
found it impossible effectively
to protect its Government
monopoly. Two years ago the
trust agreed to restrict its con-
cession to a smaller area, in
return for compensation
amounting to £\\ million. This
enabled the Government to
issue licences to the newcomers,
and so attempt a measure of
control. It failed, and last year
some 50,000, French Africans
had to be deported. Their
place was quickly taken by
Sierra Leone Africans from the
north, and the recent riots in
the Yengema area show that
the problem has become even
more intractable.”
London “Time and Tide,”
however, suggests that these
troubles “need cause neither
surprise nor undue alarm”:
“If diamonds are to be had
for the picking they will be
picked and all the Queen’s
horses and all the Queen’s men
will not bring the colony back
to sobriety until the diamond
crop is exhausted. If the
sudden outcrop of wealth has
created poverty and inflation
in the colony, that is a paradox
which will hardly surprise
economists.
“Sierra Leone is, in some
respects, the final exposure of
the colonialist myth. It is a
product neither of Imperialist
greed nor of commercial ill-
greed. When the British
Navy was pursuing gunboat-
diplomacy by liberating the
victims of the slavers, the
missionaries persuaded the
Government to establish
Freetown as a trading-post for'
the rescued. The Colonial
Office, unwilling as usual to
take on any added responsi-
bilities, fought a stubborn
rearguard action when the
traders, backed by the mis-
sionaries, asked for the hinter-
land to be taken into care and
protection, so that they should
be sure of markets and civii
peace.
“Thus Sierra Leone was
born, an uneasy amalgam of
expatriates and native tribes.
The two groups have nothing
in common, except the unity
which colonial administration
imposes. Some day the cry for
a disastrous and totally mean-
ingless independence will be
raised with such fervor that
Sierra Leone will start on the
short trek back to chaos. It
is a pattern that has been
wearily repeated, but Sierra
Leone is likely to provide • a
particularly rich example.
“When the history of the
British Empire comes to be
written a century or so from
now, it may well be found that
in the great climacteric of their
destiny the British sacrificed
civilisation in the name of
Progress, and the result was
barbarism.”
Various Voices
J. D. Ormond, chairman of
the New Zealand Meat Board :
“Britain will remain our main
market. If Britain is placed
under a severe handicap in
trade with Europe, we, in turn,
are affected. I believe Britain
must participate in a European
trade plan of one kind or
another. The integration of
West European States into an
economic association or union
seems inevitable, but we need
to consider whether the
Commonwealth can in some
way participate and whether it
cannot strengthen economic co-
operation within its own
membership.”

Sir Thomas Williamson
(president of this year’s Trades
Union Congress ): “Peace in
industry is not a political issue
nor should it be made into one
by the Government, the em-
ployers or ourselves [the trade-
unions]. As a movement we
renounce any challenge to the
sovereignty of Parliament. If
we dislike a Government, and
I am certain we have no affec-
tion for this one, we resist the
temptation to dislodge it by
industrial action. In a demo-
cracy trade-unionists, like all
other citizens, have political
rights. But we cannot and
ought not to claim political
privileges because we are
trade-unionists.”
.* * #
Jo Grimond, leader of the
British Liberal party : “We are
all faced with the need of this
country [Great Britain], and
all countries, to accept some
abatement of sovereignty. It
is absolute criminal folly for
the Western world to remain
disunited in foreign policy and
defence and to attempt to main-
tain a nineteenth-century con-
ception of sovereignty. I do
not believe that the victory of
the West will come through
force and power. It will come
through the attraction of ideas
and a more successful civilisa-
tion.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Education
Two days before the school
holidays began my young in-
vestment in the future brought
home a dodger with a specious
argument on why I should
support the teachers in their
blow-for-blow fight with the
State Public Service Board.
Considering the family holidays
are two weeks at Christmas,
I’m afraid I wasn’t in the mood
to rush out and sign a petition,
but I can give ’em all a piece of
advice.
If school classes are too
large in N.S.W., let's cut down
the number of kids attending.
If parents want to have “super-
vised play” for their youngsters
between five and six, let ’em
pay for it. Kindergartens are
nice for “Education Week,”
but those healthy young
teachers could be doing some-
thing a bit more useful than
teaching little Billy nursery-
rhymes and how to sit still.
And what’s this crazy notion
that an 11-year-old can’t cope
with high-school first-year?
Twenty years ago, the same
lessons, except in languages
and science, were taught in the
top primary classes. If an 11-
year-old is bright enough to do
well in the last primary classes,
the theory these days is that
he or she should go on to
“opportunity - classes” before
going to high school. As
opportunity-classes are few
and far between, the youngsters
languish in sixth class for
another year—and enlarge the
class.
Next, consider the school-
leaving-age of 15. Any child
worthy of it should sit for
and pass Intermediate and if
possible the Leaving Certificate.
Those with ambitions for
tertiary education can be
catered for. But not all
children want to face the Inter-
mediate. Any teacher can tell
you of the children who are
only at school because of the
law. There could be no more
disheartening job than trying
to teach the child who is
counting the weeks to his or
her birthday and freedom.
A person is not second-rate
because he is not “academic.”
He can be clean, kindly, con-
scientious, honest and patriotic.
He may know a lot more about
film-actors than about poli-
ticians’ pledges, but he can still
do a darn good job of being a
first-class citizen without certifi-
cates. Why fence him in when
he would rather be sweeping a
factory floor and being paid
for it? Let him out at 14 and
let the teacher turn his atten-
tion to the willing pupil who
can use what the teacher has
to give.
If schools decided to teach
and be damned to you, as the
old-timers used to do it, and
threw out both the frills clutter-
ing-up the system and the un-
necessary pupils, the kids might
not enjoy it, but they might
find themselves acquiring know-
ledge in such a way that it
would stick to them all their
lives.
As a parent, nothing bores
me so much as “projects.”
These precious time-wasters
seem to be more important than
the most elementary spelling,
history and geography, but if
the knowledge gained by
collecting folders and making
scrapbooks sticks to the kids,
I’ve yet to see it.
It may not be important to
know the names and dates of
Marlborough’s victories any
more, but my kids’ historical
knowledge lurches from know-
ing all about the 'Medes and the
Persians to knowing nothing
about the Battle of Hastings.
The only people in Australian
history they seem to know are
Dirk Hartog (why him?), Cook
and Phillip. And as for Cook,
his voyages, apart from arriving
at Botany Bay, could be on
another planet for all they know
of world 1 geography.
I’ve four kids at school, and
the new, let-the-individual-
grow theory of education
leaves me stone-cold-frozen.
When they leave school, they
will learn they have to 1 fill-in
the blanks in their education
the old, solid way if they want
to master a trade —and I mean
blanks, no matter what certifi-
cates they might gain, and no
matter what teachers are paid.

There was lately, at Goulburn
(N.S.W.), a seminar held under
the auspices of the N.S.W.
Department of Education to
acquaint primary schoolteachers
with a method of teaching
spoken English which the
department, in collaboration
with the A.8.C., has been send-
ing over the air to all primary

As broadcast, these lessons
take the form of visual exercises
in which squads of youngsters
are used to present sentences,
of which each child represents
a word —the position of the
individual corresponding to the
relative importance of the word.
The system, as I see it,
eschews all tenets of accepted
“educated” English, including
correct pronunciation, pho-
netics or clarity of diction. It
concentrates the juvenile atten-
tion upon grouping of words
and emphasis—such instruction
as is given relative to pronunci-
ation accepts as correct such
otiose interpretations as “uv”
for of, “frum” for from, “und”
for and, “me” for my, etc.
It is the avowed aim of this
system to foster among children
attending State schools a form
of English typically Australian,
but any reasoning student of
philology and the evolution of
speech knows that this objective
would be reached far more
satisfactorily through natural
development than by a
deliberate attempt to induce
slovenly speech over a limited
section of Australia’s juvenile
population.
I understand that the cult
of a specifically Australian
brand of English has the bless-
ing of an advisory committee
which includes Professor
Mitchell of the Faculty of
English at Sydney University;
but, according to Professor
Mitchell’s published ideas on
this subject, Australian speech
will later, if not at present, have
two different types: “educated”
and other. Which of the two
will be “Australian,” however,
is not made clear. It is interest-
ing to speculate upon what
might have happened in IJ.S.A.
or in London when Bronx and
down-east Cockney were in
their formative stages, had they
taken the ear of artificial-
speech carpenters.
Incidentally, at the seminar
mentioned, there was a surpris-
ing climax when the principal
exponent of the new system
made his summarising speech in
“educated” English, even to the
correct pronunciation of the
despised monosyllables.— Fred
Aarons (N.S.W.).
Motor-car Design
As an experienced and long-
suffering owner, I can only
agree with “C.E.G.” (B.
4/9/’57), but as a draughtsman
I must assure him that we are
practically voiceless in the
matter of motor-car design.
The man who provides the
capital for manufacturing
wields the power, and has the
most influence over policy and
design. His refuge is that most
used by newspapers: “We give
the public what it wants.”
The modern car represents
most that is deplorable in
design and function. Compared
with, say, the aircraft industry,
the auto.-manufacturers are
still hanging from trees by
tails. Unfortunately the buying
public is so gullible that it still
believes that price and shiny
bad taste are substitutes for true
service.
The modem car is surpris-
ingly useless when searched for
good points. It is extraordin-
arily cluttered with fetishes, and
there is little built into it that
didn’t exist practically when
the Wright brothers made their
first flight.
Most of the new models on
the market are functionally
retrograde and more expensive

Manufacturers in both America
and England should know
better than to offer these
modern expensive millstones to
people who wish to travel at
reasonable cost.
The situation may well cure
itself. American manufac-
turers, who took the wrong
road after the war, are now
alarmed to see how many of
their employees travel to work
in small foreign cars which are,
in fact, functionally superior
to the brand-new heaps made in

“Moonlighting”
It was to be expected, I
suppose, that the nation which
has enriched the English
language with such expressive
terms as “speakeasy,” “stool-
pi ge o n,” “skyscraper,” and
“undercat,” should come up
with a picturesque new word to
denote the holding of more
than one job at the one time.
“Moonlighting,” in the
United States, means double —
or mu 11 ip 1 e —employment,
which is rapidly increasing. An
American industrial - research
organisation estimates that
there are “several million”
moonlighters in the United
States today.
Probing into the reasons for
the popularity of moonlighting,
the researchers opine that “the
motive in almost all cases is the
desire for additional income to
offset the high cost of living” ;
but evidence indicated that the
shorter working-week and the
extension of automation were
aiding and abetting the practice
—the first by providing addi-
tional “leisure,” and the second
by reducing work-fatigue to a
minimum.
In spite of the stern dictum
“one man, one job” being still
official policy in Australian
Labor circles, moonlighting
has become pretty well
established in our own country,
and for the same reasons. If
you doubt this, reckon up the
number of your own acquain-
tances who carry on some
activity, whether it is a part-
time job or some more-or-less
profitable hobby.
Even where terms of employ-
ment strictly prohibit engage-
ment in off-duty hours, as in
the public service, moonlighting
is now prevalent—just how
prevalent, probably no one
knows or Is likely to discover.
Many employers raise no
objection to the practice, so
long as employees do their job
with reasonable efficiency.
Why should anyone object?
“Moonlighting” in itself is
neither good nor bad ; if a man
cares to work longer hours
than the short, standard work-
ing-week, why shouldn’t he be
encouraged to do so rather
than fritter away his leisure in
useless or wasteful pastimes?
Diehards may assert that no
man can do justice to himself
by engaging in more than one
job ; sticklers for professional
ethics may infer that it is
beneath a bank-officer’s dignity
to act, say, as a totalisator-clerk
in his off-hours ; Labor leaders
may claim that the man who
takes on two jobs is keeping a
fellow-unionist out of one —
though in the higher circles of
the Labor organisation plurality
of jobs seems the rule rather
than the exception.
But moonlighting is here to,
stay. The 40-hour week has
made sure of that with the
increase in living-costs that it
entailed. — Ardoyne (Vic.).
Living on the Pension
Far be it from me, young
and well-fixed financially, to
decry the current propaganda
for higher pensions for the
aged, particularly if the poor
souls are in the penury alleged.
But are they? Or need they
be?
Politicoes have always made
a stalking-horse of the pension-
able—it is good sob-stuff —
but wouldn’t their cause be
better served if they were helped
to make-do on their £4 7s. 6d.
a week, rather than have added
to penury the humiliation of
being a theme-subject for
political opportunists?
As an accountant I have
been supervising the affairs of
a pensionable couple, aged 81
and 78. Country folk, the
husband retired because of ill-
health, and they moved to the
. city to be near married children.
They had household furniture,
effects and napery; a stock of
garments and footwear which,
if frugally used, would sec
them out; and money enough
invested to bring in a little
under £lOO a year.
They had not bought a house,
and proposed “living on their
fat” (capital savings), and
asked me to prepare them a
pattern for living and a system
of finance. Above all, they
(especially the wife) wanted to
avoid the horror of “going on
the pension.” Neither drank
nor smoked, nor cared much
for films or live entertainment.
They read a lot and enjoyed
the radio.
At their request we made a
plan whereby they should con-
trive to live within the pension
sum (£8 a week), drawing
more of the “fat” if that did not
cover their needs. Adhering
strictly to this premise, we
did it comfortably, if not easily,
and with one of the couple on
an invalid diet.
For four years they paid £3
a week rent for a flat. This
covered hot water and refrigera-
tion, but they had to pay also
for gas, electricity, phone rent,
replacements and insurance,
and out of their little £lOO a
year income they gave always
“a tithe to the Lord.” Their
cost of living, including papers,
postage, writing - materials,
radio-fee and phone-calls,
averaged £6 11s. a week.
A year ago their flat was
sold over their heads and they
had to get out. Their next flat
(a half-house) costs £5 a week,
but this includes gas, electricity,
hot-water, refrigeration (their
own frig.), toll-phone and a
little handyman-service. They
surrendered life-policies that
had been costing them £l5 a
year and added the capital
amount to their “fat,” earning
interest of £l3 10s. a year. For
this year their cost of living
has been £7 ss. a week, as
against a new pension-rate of
£8 15s.
I have checked figures
actuarially and know they are
correct. The old people have
not had a stiver of money-aid
from the family—nothing
beyond a milk-pudding or a
cake now and then, and a little
laundering of big linens.
I confess I am mystified, not
by my old friends’ figures, but
by the widespread outcry that
pensioners must needs perish
on £4 (or even £4 7s. 6d.)
a week.— R. D. Kerley
(N.S.W.).
The Gaza Strip
Syria and Jordan appear to
be the danger-spots in the
Middle East today ; but another
real tinderbox is the Gaza Strip,
so much in the news earlier in
the year though now barely
heard of.
Gaza has its place in history.
It was the southernmost of the
five cities of the Philistines
(Askelon, Ashdod, Ekron,
Gath and Gaza); it was in the
strip that the Philistines
settled after the failure of their
invasion of Egypt. In 1188 b.c.
Pharaoh Rameses 111, calling on
every able-bodied man in
Egypt, hurled back the pre-
viously irresistible Philistines
in a battle of “prime significance
in world history” (Keller, The
Bible as History).
It was in Gaza that Samson
pulled down about his head
the pillars of the Philistine
temple; as, many centuries
later, the Macedonian Christian
fanatic St. Porphyrius tore
down the temple of Gaza’s
tutelary god. In between, Gaza
had been completely destroyed
by Alexander the Great (332
8.C.).
Coming back to the present,
the Arab population of the


strip is about 300,000, of whom
two-thirds are refugees. The
permanent inhabitants are
naturally finding the going
tough—for one thing, much
of what was their best land
is across the armistice-line in
Israel. However, as historian
Arnold Toynbee said after a
recent visit, “at least they still
have something to live on and
something to do. The refugees
have nothing to do but to
brood over injustice.” They
blame Israel for all their
troubles and openly demand
land from Israel as a solution.
This could never be, of
course ; and would not be right
or justified. Yet, as a matter
of “prime significance,” some-
thing should be done for these
refuge e s. If not As
Toynbee further remarked,
after recalling Samson and
Porphyrius, “There are plenty
of fanatics and plenty of
prisoners in the Gaza Strip
today. Their tempers are on
edge, and some desperate act
of demolition could still bring,
not just a single temple or
theatre, but the whole of
civilisation tumbling in ruins
about the ears of the human
race.”— Kejokada (Vic.).
Tobacco
I appreciate “R.G.V.’s”
support for the product which
he grows (B. 18/9/’57), but the
consensus of opinion, both lay
and expert, is that the best
Australian tobacco-leaf lacks
the quality of imported stands.
Local manufacturers back this
opinion in their blending.
Apparently the axis of the
argument has been moisture-
content, on which flavor largely
depends. Because of its natural
dryness (due mainly, according
to experts, to the fierceness of
our sun), the best Australian
leaf does not respond to “proc-
torising” or reconditioning with
rum, molasses, etc., in the
factory as does the best
Virginian or imported. The
Australian leaf does not retain
moisture to the degree necessary
for good smoking (especially as
cigarettes) unless blended with
a leaf, such as Virginian, which
certainly does. —P.O.M. C.
(N.S.W.).
My Budget Speech
After listening to a good
many of the Budget speeches
from Canberra I have to make
my speech-in-reply, or bust:
Mr. Chairman: There are a
good many points about this
Budget which have been over-
looked or deliberately avoided
by speakers on both sides of
the House. My chief concern
is that while the Government
is drifting away from the
Liberal principles on which it
was first elected it is confronted
by' an Opposition which is
quite unwilling itself to speak
for taxpayers, and which
merely wants more and more
of the “social-service benefits”
which are now a major politi-
cal stock on both sides of
politics.
First, let me point out that
the Prime Minister did not
reply to the point made by the
Leader of the Opposition that
a far greater number of people
in this country are not consum-
ing a proportionately greater
amount of food. This may be
a good thing. A lot of doctors
say we over-eat, anyway. But
the fact that we are spending
less per head on food and
clothes does suggest some
lowering of the standard of
living, even if we are buying
(on time-payment, of course)
more cars and refrigerators.
And it wasn’t quite honest for
the Pripie Minister to cite the
figures for liquor and tobacco.
We may be paying more for
those things (are they luxuries
or necessities?), but only
because of the higher and
heartless taxes. In other words,
we are paying a lot more

money for a lot less beer —and
the Prime Minister, who
doesn’t drink beer, knows it.
The plain fact is that the
indirect taxes are having an
increasingly serious effect on
our living standards, and it’s
a crushing effect on the smaller-
income families.
The Opposition isn’t- likely
to point out the fallacy under
which the Government takes
taxes from us to finance works
which should be financed out
of loan-funds. The Prime
Minister proclaimed that this
was being done because the
States got all the proceeds of
loan-funds and more (that
more included your taxes and
mine), and therefore the Com-
monwealth had to finance its
own works, including the
expanding postal services and
the Snowy scheme, out of
revenue—which again is our
taxes. But why should I, who
will get no benefit from the
Snowy scheme, have to pay
for it? My children and their
children, who , will benefit, I
trust, should bear the costs,
including the sinking fund.
The Prime Minister says it is
because people won’t subscribe
to loans. Why won’t they?
It isn’t only the comparatively
low rate of interest, although
that is partly the reason. The
real reason is that the average
wage-earner has so little left
after paying the present savage
direct and indirect taxation
that he is quite unable to buy
bonds. He puts a few pounds,
if he’s lucky, in the savings-
bank against rainy weather and
has perforce to ignore the
allurements both of the
Treasury flotations and the
high-interest floats of the hire-
purchase companies. Reduce
taxes properly and more money
will soon flow into loans.
There are two major reasons
why these taxes are so high.
One is the growing cost of
welfare payments and the other
is the immense and unchecked
increase in the cost of the
Federal public service. (There’s
also the costs of our ineffective
defence services, but I’ll skip
those for now.)
The welfare system, with a
means-test and without any
provision for any form of
national insurance, is the joint
responsibility of both sides of
politics. I can recall the
Prime Minister, a good many
years ago, extolling the virtues
of thrift and providence which
were lauded by his parents
(and mine), and practised to
an extent which made the
taking of “the pension” an
unthinkable humiliation, to be
guarded against and provided
against at all costs to immedi-
ate pleasure and easier living.
Those virtues have not only
been discouraged, they have
been destroyed.
Isn’t it time that someone
got down to assessing which
classes of people must be
helped at all times, such as the
hopelessly and chronically ill,
and those which must again be
encouraged to help themselves,
“Where WAS I last night?"
and- given the financial incen-
tives to do so?
In the public service we
have the spectacle of the
Treasury men loving the feeling
of being the real power in the
land,’ telling the departments
they can’t spend too much, and
in the next breath assuring the
Prime Minister and the
Treasury that there is “an
irreducible minimum” (how
they love that phrase!) below
which the costs of administra-
tion can’t be reduced. What a
lot of rubbish this is. And
how the heads of departments
defy any minor Treasury moves
for economy by getting their
Ministers to fight in Cabinet
for larger and larger alloca-
tions, which will increase the
prestige of Minister and depart-
mental chief alike.
The public service, or at
least that unproductive section
of it which is not engaged in
the “business enterprises” of
state, has some hard-working
men and a great many loafers.
I have been in many depart-
ments in Canberra, and I know
of thousands of public servants
who spend the first half-hour
at least of every “working”
day reading their papers and
talking football or races.
The answer is to suspend all
recruiting for the service—and
I mean all, permanent and
temporary, youths and maidens
—for two or three years. The
departments would lose staffs
by the attrition of retirement,
and they would be compelled
to manage with those smaller
staffs, and without overtime.
This would pierely make their
employees knuckle-down to
something like the amount of
work expected from the staffs
of commercial enterprises,
although they would still retain
that blessed boon of “security”
which so many of them seem
to prize so highly. In the
meantime, far more youths
would go into productive
primary and secondary em-
ployments, and the public-
service wages-bill would go
down by an amount that would
enable some real cuts in direct
and indirect taxes. —Ex-ACT
(N.S.W.).
Sauce for the Goose
It’s not always sauce for the
gander, particularly when that
bird happens to be a Merino
sheep. The chairman of the
Australian Wool Growers’
Council has said that Australian
industries which have little hope
of selling their goods at com-
petitive world prices no longer
deserve protection at the
expense of Australia’s trade
with Japan. He added that
many Australian industries
have grown up behind the pro-
tection of import-restrictions
which have become a greater
protection to Australian manu-
facturers than tariffs in many
cases.
It all depends on the point
of view. Many years ago Aus-
tralia was saddled with a high
London exchange-rate, put on
largely to assist the struggling
man-on-the-land, woolgrowers
in particular. That artificial
rate is paid for by the whole
of Australia, is highly infla-
tionary and has never been
reduced and never will be so
long as the Country party, led
by Sir Arthur Fadden, has a
say in things.
Nobody can maintain that
woolgrowers need that arti-
ficial bolster, yet there would
be mighty protests in C.P.
circles if any attempt were
made to reduce it, even
gradually.
Any competition which Aus-
tralian wool has to face is
negligible compared with
what our manufacturers have
to contend with in overseas
markets. It’s very easy to
look with equanimity on the
arrival of cheap Japanese
goods, secure in the knowledge
that the Nips cannot grow wool
and ship it here. — Ceg (Vic.).

"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
ADELAIDE ROYAL SHOW
By CHRIS GRIFFITH
TF anyone ever doubted the
seriousness of show com-
petition the place to dispel
those doubts was the sheep
pavilion at this month’s
Adelaide Royal Show.
Ten Merino sheep, including
a ram which won the reserve
grand-championship at the
Sydney Sheep Show last year,
had been banned from the
judging ring. While the un-
concerned sheep stayed in their
pens all day, their owners and
other sheepmen heatedly
discussed the action.
The sheep had been banned
by the technical reference
committee responsible to the
S.A. Stud Merino Sheep
Breeders’ Association. Each
year since 1947 this three-man
committee has inspected Show
sheep the night before judging.
Any entries not complying with
published show standards were
prevented from entering the
ring. Of course, dissatisfaction
at time and method of shearing
In some regions of
the Transvaal sheep
are reared exclusively
for mutton, the
country being unsuit-
able for woolgrowing
because of humid
weather conditions
and excessive growth
of thorny bushes.
Scientists are now
trying to breed a local
type of sheep with a
sparse hairy coat
instead of fleece!
Even in the case of
such a breed the
marking and tailing
of the lambs by “Elas-
trator” Rubber Rings
would be advisable
because lambs marked
and tailed in this way
suffer little, if any,
set-back and thus
maintain prime con-
dition.
often lay behind disqualifica-
tion, but the committee never
gave a reason when it banned
a sheep.
In previous years the odd
animal had been blackballed,
but never had the committee
“And even if it DOES rain , the grass'll get so high , come a
bushfire , We'll still be ruined!"
singled out such a great
number, or sheep of such
quality. Three were top Merino
rams from studs with impressive
show records.
One stud, S. Kidman Co.’s
Eringa Park at Kapunda (S.A.),
had three or four rams banned,
but went on to take both” the
ewe grand-championship and
the ewe reserve grand-
championship. Last year it
had won the ram grand-
championship.
Mr. Murray Thomas, of.
Stradbrooke Stud, Clare (S.A.),'
owned the reserve grand-
champion ram at Sydney last
year, which was also banned.
Thomas said he would not
show at Adelaide again unless
official inspection at shearing
was introduced in S.A.
“Apparently the committee
was not satisfied with the shear-
ing, but you cannot tell a
year later when a sheep was
shorn,” he said. Well-known
breeder Mr. G. E. Kirkby, of
Success Stud, Moree (N.S.W.),
who had judged the Thomas
ram at Sydney, commented on
the action:
“The S.A. system places the
inspection committee in an
unfortunate position. As the
reasons are not disclosed, the
public reaction is always likely
to be uncertain. I think the
Sydney system of post-shearing
inspection is preferable. This
guarantees that the sheep are
shorn satisfactorily at the right
time. Better still, it could well
be left to the judge himself.
After all, if a judge thinks a
sheep has been incorrectly
shorn, he will pass over it,
selecting another for the
ribbon.”
The night after the judging,
the issue was raised at the
annual S.A. Sheep Breeders’
meeting. With little ado, and
with good humor prevailing,
they voted to introduce a
system similar to Sydney's,
beginning with the next year’s
Royal Show.
The incident in no way
detracted from the success of
the 1957 sheep section. It was
a triumph for L. M. Rayner, of
The Bluff, Hallett (S.A.), who
won the Merino ram grand-
championship with a ram which
had earlier been judged strong-
wool champion. He also
paraded the reserve grand-
champion Merino ram. His
grand-champion was the son of
the 1955 Adelaide grand-
champion, and the grand-
son of a 2550gns. purchase
from the Collinsville Stud, Mt.
Bryan (S.A,).
Rayner also claimed the
Adelaide equivalent to Sydney’s
Stonehaven Cup—the Jubilee
Challenge Trophy. All told, he
walked off with eight champion-
ships and a host of class-prize
ribbons. Yet his show team,
consisting of 17 sheep, was the
smallest he had ever brought to
Adelaide.
Highlight of the Poll Merino
section was the double win of
new breeders R. V. and N. S.
Rzeszkowski, of Balaklava
(S.A.). They won both medium-
wool and strong-wool ram-
championships with Donara
(S.A.) bred sheep.
Both Poll-ewe champion-
ships -went to R. W. Lehmann
and Sons, Flairville, George-
town (S.A.).
The growing popularity of
Poll Merinos was later reflected
jit the sales, when 31 were
offered and 26 head sold for
an overall average of £231 14s.
This exceeded the overall
average for Merinos this year,
which was £203 Is. for 249
rams - a South Australian
record. The Poll sale included
an S.A. record - breaking
lOOOgns. Poll Boonoke (N.S.W.)
ram which was bought by T. J.
Bailey, of Somme Brae, Boobo-
rowie (S.A.).
Not to be outdone, John
Collins and Sons set an

a Merino ram. They obtained
3250gns. for their first ram,
which went to H. C. Nitschke,
of Willogoleeche, Hallett (S.A.).
They sold another for

Hallett (S.A.). During the two
days, Collinsville had a remark-
able sale. They offered 23
rams —the largest catalogue—

average of £1055 12s. This is
also an Adelaide record. Last

averages at £647; the year
before they averaged £493 19s.
Their aggregate comprised one-
third of the total turnover at the

The Sad Plight of
Agricultural Science
A SURVEY by the appoint-
ments board of the Uni-
versity of Melbourne shows
that, of all the university-
trained men, agricultural
scientists are at the bottom of
the list when it comes to
salaries.
This news hasn’t had the
impact it might have had,
possibly because many people
have suspected it for quite some
time; yet in a country where
prosperity depends on a
thriving agriculture and com-
petitive prices on world
markets it is very serious
indeed,

point that, without our cheques
from the export of wool, meat,
butter, and other agricultural
produce, Australia would soon
be bankrupt. Even the manu-
facturing industries would soon
starve for the essential raw
materials which make up the
bulk of our imports
Except for wool, Australia is
finding it very difficult to sell its
main exports at competitive
prices, and this position will
probably get worse before it
gets better.
If our primary industries are
to stay in the race with other
countries more favorably
endowed with soils and climate,
they must concentrate more
on quality and efficiency, or
risk losing markets. Here is an
enormous task for the agri-
cultural scientist, with the
future wellbeing of Australia
as the stake.
The solution of this number-
one problem facing Australia
is expected of the Cinderella
of the sciences. In other words,
our poorest-paid scientists are
expected to do the biggest job
of all.
There’s not much incentive
there, yet agricultural science
has a second-to-none record
of achievement in Australia.
For a start, it has one major
disadvantage compared with
most of the other sciences. It
cannot make as much use of
similar research being done by
overseas scientists. Chemistry
is chemistry, whether research
is done in Sydney, London, or
Moscow, and the same applies
to many other fields of
research. Australian agricul-
tural scientists, however, have
to tackle problems peculiar to
Australia, and, in contrast with
most of the countries which
are competing strongly for our
markets, have no backlog of
trial - and - error experience
gained by farmers over many
generations.
In little more than a cen-
tury they have had to graft a
completely new concept of land-
use onto this continent. How
many of the livestock grazed
or the crops grown today grew
naturally in Australia before
the white man dame? Trans-
plantation of the old-world
agriculture onto a new and
untried continent hasn’t been
an easy business, and science
has had to take the place of
many years of experience.
When you are trying to
catch up in a century, what
has been developed over far,
far longer periods in other
countries, you have to learn
your lessons and solve your
problems quickly. Add to this
the hazards of a country with
perhaps the least and most
unreliable rainfall, and the
poorest natural soils, and you
get some idea of what has
already been achieved, and
what is yet to be done,’ in
unlocking the productivity of
Australia.
The extra income for the
people of Australia due to the
effects of myxomatosis has
been conservatively estimated at
£5O million a year. That’s
more than the C.5.1.R.0. has
had to spend on agricultural
research in the whole of its
lifetime.
Offer to sell a landholder a
secret that will make his land
ten times as valuable and he
will borrow money to buy it.
Yet discovery of the fact that
a few shillings worth of trace-
elements to the acre will boost
carrying-capacity enormously
has done this to many millions
of acres in Australia, and will
do it for many millions more.
Plant-breeders and soil-
scientists have brought produc-
tivity to enormous areas,
formerly written-off as com-
paratively useless, at a minute
fraction of the cost that
countries like Holland spend to
cadge a few acres back from
the seas.
The survey of professional
salaries revealed that the
highest went to doctors,
lawyers and dentists, in that
order, and it is understandable
that people will pay well when
they are in trouble. The big
difference is that the symp-
toms of the trouble you take to
a doctor, lawyer or dentist are
far more obvious and urgent
to the individual than those
which need the aid of an agri-
cultural scientist.
It’s also understandable that
the agricultural scientist should
be puzzled at the general lack,
of interest in investing in the
best investment in Australia.
He can see the enormous
potential of Australia if science
is used as the key to unlock it,
and it is unfortunate that the
average person cannot see it
also.
Farmers, somewhat sceptical
at first, are now realising just
how much this research means
in increased productivity and a
better understanding of the
problems they meet. Only in
the last year or both the
wheat- and the wool-industries
have voluntarily asked the
Government to place a levy
on their production to finance
further research into their
industries. There is every
indication that the meat-
industry will do likewise before
long.
In the last year or two, some
business organisations have
contributed money to the Aus-
tralian Institute of Agricultural
Science to help it recruit more
young naen, but this is still only
playing with the problem.
Until the general community
realises how much it owes to
the technical advances in agri-
culture in recent years, agri-
cultural science will remain
the Cinderella of the sciences
—a science with so much to
offer, but with so little
encouragement.
The Australian citizen
recognises in a general way
that Australia is riding on the
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(12/9/’57)
Queensland may have only patchy rainfall during
October, although good rains are likely in the north-west,
Gulf country and north coast. Apart from reasonably good
rain in the south-east, the State will probably have only
patchy rainfall in November.
Moderate rain should occur on the coast, tablelands,
north-west slopes and plains and south-west of N.S.W.
during October, although elsewhere it will probably be
patchy. November should also be a month of patchy rainfall,
with good rains during December.
Reasonably good follow-on rains are likely in Victoria
during October, with the best falls in East Gippsland.
Similar rainfall may occur during November, with patchy
rains in December.
The agricultural areas of South Australia should receive
moderate rains below average during October, with light
rain in the Murray Valley, west coast and interior.
The south-west and south coastal areas of Western
Australia should receive moderate to good rains during
October; light and patchy elsewhere.

Bulk Barley
“Yorktown”: There are
several difficulties in the way of
bulk-handling of barley. One of
the major ones is that barley
is separated into several grades
necessitating several partitions
in each silo. And before
barley is bulked its moisture-
content must be tested —tfie
grain sweats if stored too
damp.
Too many customers, such as
local maltsters and Japan,
prefer delivery in bags, and
some small orders are better
shipped in bags than occupy-
ing only part of a hold in bulk.
The Australian Barley
Board’s current experiment
should yield valuable results,
but it seems that the industry
will need bag-sewers and
lumpers for a few years yet.
Useful Bunnies
“Hudson”: While scientists
are doing their best to wipe out
the common field rabbit with
myxomatosis, etc., they are
also making use of bunny’s
cousins from Holland and
Flanders —the ones with the
long ears —for identifying plant
diseases.
It works something like this:
You inject the virus you want
to test into the rabbit’s blood,
wait a few days, drain off some
blood, and the red corpuscles
are then separated from the
colorless serum.
A drop of this serum is then
mixed with a drop of potato
sap. If the mixture is colorless,
the potato is healthy as far as
that particular virus is con-
cerned. If it goes creamy, the
spud’s got the disease all
right, even if other symptoms
are not obvious.
This method saves scientists
much time and labor.
"Royal Jelly"
“B-herd”: Demand for
“Royal jelly,” third product of
the beehive, is increasing. In
other countries, very high
prices are being paid and
supply lags ; one or two U.S.
firms are currently advertising
for supplies in the “Australian
Beekeeper.”
A Westralian concern which
cannot meet demand is offering
£5 an ounce. That, to the out-
sider, may sound quite a price,
but to men producing a
thimbleful from a hive it is too
low to command interest. One
or two others, queen-breeders
normally, are advertising Royal
jelly along with their queens.
A couple of years ago they
would have been laughed out
of the journal; at present, all
producers accept the trend and
look for further developments.
There is, however, a section
throughout the beekeeping
world which protests at this
burgeoning of trade in Royal
jelly and urges that, until
scientific evidence is advanced
to support the experimenters’
claims", the whole thing may
rebound adversely on bee-
keepers.
Whether or not the bee-
keepers in other countries are
hopping on the wagon and
supplying the elixir willy-nilly
to the highest bidder is not
known, but in Australia bee-
men only supply Royal jelly on
request and with diffidence,
Price, too, is about the sanest
in the world. One Queensland
supplier asks a modest 30d. a
cell —cheaper than cough-
medicine. This man is a
commercial queen-raiser and if
he allowed the larvae to stay and
emerge as a queen he would
get 15s. for it. If that’s not
diffidence, what is?
No professors are delving
into the stuff here, but at least
two American universities are
working on Royal jelly. Bee-
keepers everywhere are waiting
on their findings.

CANBERRA
Springtime brings with it a number of
conventions to Canberra, when the
capital certainly looks its best with
millions of trees in full blossom. A con-
vention which created much interest was
that of the Royal Australian Chemical
Institute officially opened by the
Governor-General, Sir William Slim, at
the Hotel Canberra. As most of the 200
delegates were accompanied by their
wives it was a gala opening, before getting
down to the serious discussions on the


agenda. Following the opening, after-
noon-tea was served on the lawns. Visit-

Governor-General of the seventh British
Commonwealth Forestry Conference,
held for the first time in Canberra, a
ladies’ committee arranged an afternoon-
party to entertain wives of delegates at
Forestry House, Yarralumla. Mrs. M. R.
Jacobs was one of a group of hostesses
who welcomed the guests. Lady Gosling,
whose husband, Sir Arthur Gosling, is
director-general of the U.K. Forestry
Commission, was a visitor, also Lady
Champion from England. Noted also
Lady Carrington, wife of the U.K. High
Commissioner, wearing a lovely flowered
hat in pale-blue with her black suit; Mrs.

The Pan-Pacific and South-East Asian
Women’s Association gave a late-after-
noon reception at University House to
entertain delegates from inter-State.
Guests were welcomed by Canberra
president Miss N. Burbridge, who wore a
pretty pink hat with her silver-grey
brocade suit, and by Senator Agnes
Robertson, world vice-president and
national president of the association. Miss
Jessie Robertson, the Senator’s daughter,
was a visitor from W.A.; she is national
secretary. Other visitors were Rev. W.
Kiek, from South Australia ; Mrs. G. L.
Byth, Queensland president; Mrs. N.
Cameron from Victoria ; Mrs. T. Kirkly
representing N S.W.; Mrs. F. L. Weiss,
South Australian president; Miss R.
Gallagher, N.S.W., and Miss N. Weaver,
Tasmanian president.

TV cameras and bright lights empha-
sised the dramatic quality of the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Ball held at the Troc.
during the week. The Governor, Lieut.-
General Woodward, and Mrs. Woodward
were present, and the world of fashion and
theatre was well represented. Eightsome
reels (arranged by Miss Nuttie Mackellar)
were danced. Mr. Mervyn Horton wore
the most original mask (it represented the
Opera House), Mr. Graham Johnson was
judged the best-dressed man, president
Mrs. Dekyvere wore a white sheath-dress
embroidered with a scroll-design, Mr.
Hugh Hunt made a speech (but it was a
bit too late in the night for this Letter
to take it down in shorthand). The dress-
ing was “fabulous.” Examples: Mrs.
J. K. Schartl’s harem-skirted satin
ballerina ; Mrs. Bob Mclnerney’s pearl-
pink sheath crystal-embroidered with
panels of cream and pink ; Mrs. H. C.
Coombs’s short violet - colored dress;
Miss Gillespie’s white Dior - inspired
Grecian-line; Mrs. Norman Rydge’s
long violet dress; Mrs. Hans
Tronser’s Spanish model patterned
with medallions in heraldic colors ; and
Mrs. Margaret Fountain’s gold-patterned
brocade, with a mask of abstract design to
match. There were about 800 at the ball,
a swift-moving and colorful affair. Pro-
ceeds, naturally, are in aid of the
Elizabethan Theatre.
Miss May Pillinger, well known as
principal of the Family Welfare Bureau,
has a part in the recently-made film on
housing which is to be shown at the
Trades and Labor Conference in
November. The bureau concentrates its
work on helping people so that the
family-unit may be happy and secure, and
Miss Pillinger considers that housing is
of top-line importance in achieving this
result. The latest development of the
Family Welfare Bureau, by the way, is
the establishment of its first suburban
branch (at Wahroonga), with Mrs. Arthur
Davis as president and Mrs. Donald
Coburn as secretary. Their first function
is to be a luncheon-party at the home of
Mrs. Phillip Rudder next Friday
(Sept. 27). Miss Pillinger's photo is by
Norton Trevaire.
Always the most springlike of the
season’s dances, the Lady Mayoress's Ball
once more transformed the Town Hall
into a garden of fresh-flowering blossom,
with a bank of real daffodils on the stage
and baskets of flowers slung between the
pillars. The Governor and Mrs. Wood-
ward were present, the Premier and
Mrs. Cahill, Air-Vice-Marshal A. L.
Walters and Mrs. Walters (Air Force
cadets escorted the 16 debs). The dress-
ing was colorful, the Lady Mayoress’s
bouffant primrose organza very spring-
like. Noted Mrs C. M, Guiney’s intri-
cately draped grey chiffon, Mrs. Henry
Gunson’s cream lace over pink, Mrs. Tom
Bateman’s ice-blue satin appliqued in a
leaf-pattern. Two ex-Lady-Mayoresses
were present, Mrs. E. O’Dea (who was
the first to hold this ball) and Mrs. P. D.
Hills (in a striking brocade dress sashed
with green satin).

The Forget-Me-Not Ball at the Empress
Ballroom was as pretty as its name, with
its decor of pale-blue and primrose
balloons, blossoms, bluebirds and spring
flowers. As it was organised by the
younger sets for the Crippled Children’s
Society, the dancers were youthful in the
main and really a decoration in them-
selves. The prize for the most beautiful
blue dress brought a really lovely display,
and was won by Margaret Rauch. Sir
Kenneth and Lady Coles were guests-of-
honor, welcomed by John Oborne, whose
partner was Shirley Stedman. Other
dancers included Mary and Margaret
Tancred, Allan Johnston and Richard
Raiss.

Author Gladys Lister, whose “Little
Round House” books made her beloved
by a generation of children and
whose social and charitable work
won her troops of friends in this city,
passed into the silence quite suddenly last
Sunday. As Mrs. Jan Sopoushek she
worked on many committees and was
particularly interested in the theatre. Her
dramatisation of the “Little Round
House” at the Independent had just
begun and her opening-night party was
one of the week’s events. Right to the
end she lived a full and happy life. She
will be greatly missed.

A literary luncheon which provided a
pleasant way of imbibing knowledge as
well as nourishment during the week was
that held in aid of the Crippled Children’s
Society. Historian Malcolm Ellis spoke
on Elizabeth Macarthur, who was
the first educated woman to come
to this country and who was, apparently,
the real business-manager of the
Macarthur affairs. Mr. Richard Fitz-
hardinge introduced the speaker, and
also present were Professor Mitchell, Mr.
and Mrs. Barton Foster, Mrs. Michael
King (full of fervor about the Gaylord
Hauser diet, which prefers skim-milk to
cream), Miss Barbara Knox (back from
abroad with pleasant memories of a
sojourn with the McClure-Smiths at The
Hague), and three youthful beauties:
Mrs. Roger Dunlop, with her “My Fair
Lady” hairdo ; Mrs. Malcolm Coppleson,
and Mrs. Ludwick Berger, whose blonde
hair was done in the fascinating ne\y
“modernised Grecian” style.

a needless and foolish vanity.
Let the child keep the little
bottle.”
Tick.
Martha Ost said nothing,
closed one eye in a frightening
wink. Then she held the bottle
towards the boy. As he reached
for it she whipped back her
hand and tucked the bottle into
her bodice. Immediately the
boy bayed with temper and
began to beat on the table with
a silver spoon.
Tick.
The little girl snivelled on
the floor; the clock ticked;
brazenly the mother regarded
the cheeks of her hostess,
giggled, watched and watched,
sucked her lips, lazily spoke:
“Partial to noise, ain’t ’e,
Mrs. ’Eton?”
“Children are usually . . .”
she began, but as the boy
struck a cup to the floor, cried
out, “Oh, my Spode!” Her
face whitened ; it had been im-
possible not to cry out; she
knew she had made an error;
she heard the clock, louder its
sounds and; darkening its
seconds.
Still staring intently, her face
throbbing, Martha Ost said,
“Don’t . . . break . . . Mrs.
’Eton’s . . . tay-cups.”
She said this elaborately,
suggestively, without looking at
the boy, not ceasing to look at
Ariadne Hilton, who under-
stood that her hatred was
matched, that the mother with
her greasy chemise showing
through her half-buttoned
bodice meant, “Break, my
son! Break and smash! Smash!
Destroy!” and that she was
waiting, too, for the darkest
moment.
But the boy was a boy and,
though he therefore caught
what his mother meant, she,
too, was enemy. He threw the
spoon away, giggling in the
same hideous manner as she.
Her face rippled with anger, she
flew at him, defrauded, scream-
ing, “ ’Ow dare you!” and
flailing with her hand at his
head: “Dare you! Dare you!
Bloody little snot! Why didn’t
you do as Mam said?”
There was no doubt now.
Ariadne Hilton had been told.
So—the boy having run to
squall outside —she straightened
her back. She waited. The
two women waited — Tick—
while the clock continued its
dark output; the house shuffled
smaller; the trees stepped
nearer.
T ANGUOROUSLY Martha
Ost moved to a chair,
fluidly arranged herself, became
deadly still. Her fingers with
their black-edged nails weighed
down on her lap with the
inertia of coming appeasement.
The child on the floor absorbed
stillness from its mother, ceased
snivelling, also turned its
mother’s eyes on Ariadne
Hilton.
Tick and Tick. What next?
Not this ominous halt on a
road already travelled too far.
Smile? So smiled, and,
“Would you take a cup of tea,
Mrs. Ost?” said the hostess.
Martha Ost shook her head,
calculating, ruminating, as
though an effort of speech
would minify the quality of
staring.
“I . . said Ariadne Hilton.
She stopped. No more. No
more must be said. With terror
she felt her own hatred explode
into fiery blossom within her;
a cyclone from the equator of
murder shook and tossed this
preposterous plant of flame so
violently that it lit her face like
a lamp. God help me, she
thought, and crushed a desire to
wring her hands, God help me.
She averted her eyes from the
watcher lest the inner glare
burst through their trans-
parency. God help me, what
must I do?
“Play,” said Martha Ost,
richly and calmly, unblinking
as the paralysed sky. “Play the
music, Mrs. ’Eton.”
She scratched under her
armpit, opened her mouth,
showing her white tongue and
separated teeth. “Play pretty,”
she said. “Hi like pretty.”
White as bone, white as
torture, without a word,
Ariadne Hilton went to the
little piano and willed her
fingers to obey her and obey
inquisition, to execute melodies
she learned in a safety behind
successions of doors that could
be bolted, locked and chained.
The mid-afternoon baked the
flimsy house with its thatch,
its carpets of clay and one
lockless door; the sea moaned
feverishly of its burning and
unrest, but Ariadne Hilton
forced snow from the piano, a
curtain of snowy sounds, snow
that sprinkled itself on waxed
and carpeted parquet, thickened
on Chinese wallpaper branches,
slid like dazzling tears from a
flannel heaven near enough to
fondle . . . how cold was the
unwatching, undemand-
ing snow, cold, compassionate,
layering down deeper and
deeper peace . . .
“Sing,” the command came.
“Sing, Mrs. ’Eton.”
In the inferno where snow
had never come and never
would, she heard another voice,
her own, say, “Yes, Mrs. Ost.”
It had come to that.
From the vortex of her hell
she sang:
“Out of the deep I call
to Thee, O Lord, to thee;
before Thy Throne of Grace 1
fall;
be merciful to me.
Out of the deep l cry,
the woeful deep of sin,
of evil done”
There was a crash. She
turned. The Spode teapot lay
broken on the floor.
Martha Ost was erect, magni-
ficent, radiating a stench of
heat, smiling. Her eyes glow-
ing, with a flourish she pointed
through the open door to where
the boy trampled and tore the
garden.
“Stone-thrower! Varmint! ”
she lied 1 ringingly. “If I tell
the Lieutenant, ’e’ll w’ip the
little snot, ’e will.” She giggled.
“If I tell ... if I tell . . .”
she chanted. The baby on the
sofa began to wail.
Ariadne Hilton knew she
was defeated, would not cry
out, but pleaded:
“If you . . .please, Mrs. Ost
... I have ... I have a head-
ache.”
“Poo’ dear Mrs. ’Eton,”
smiling, smiling, no movement
other. “Would ye-e-ew teek a
cup of tay, Mrs. ’Ilton?” she
mocked. “Shall Hi pour it out
of the taypot?” She began to
giggle outrageously, could not
control herself.
“If you could please go now,.
Mrs. Ost. . . my head.”
"lyrO movement, none. No
reply. The baby was
screaming angrily—or was it
joyously and ruthlessly?
“Please, Mrs. Ost. I should
like to lie down for a while.”
“Lie down then, do. Hi shall
wait. Baby and me shall wait
’ere.” She sat down.
“No, no. I could not permit
that. .It would not be . . .”
“Baby wants to wait.”
“But, Mrs. Ost, I . . .”
“Don’t take on, Mrs. ’Eton.
Your ’eadache may be the
honset of a fever from your
poo’ ankle.”
“No. It is a usual ailment.
A spell of quiet will . . .”
“La! You might ’ave bled,
to your death.”
“Pray, Mrs. Ost . . .”
“You might ’ave bled to
your death,” she waggled her
finger, “if I ’adn’t kindly
’elped you.”
Ariadne Hilton began to
tremble. Now the house in
which there was nowhere to
hide enclosed her like a reek-
ing cell. Her Mousseline
Extract served no purpose. The
clock had ticked too far and
too darkly and too late. What
crime was gratitude fostering
with elegant manners, evasion
and weakness?
Suddenly she thought, I must
lie also, I must become an
animal in a forest, or a native,
a begging beast.
Falsely and with cunning
charm she said, “On second
thoughts, Mrs. Ost, I have
always found that a stroll
relieves the condition. I shall
... let us walk.”
And swiftly she left the
house; before Martha Ost
could protest or hinder she left
the house, the traitor clock, the
spilt and smashed treasures;
she saw the significant bluff of
trees, the clamped-down sky,
the havocked garden of her
contentment; she heard the
fretful pain of the enclosing
sea.
Presently, slowly, surly, wary,
Martha Ost appeared with baby
and child.
“I feel improved already,”
said Ariadne Hilton brightly
and quickly. “Let us walk.”
The group moved, Martha
Ost guarded and watching.
“Do you not think, Mrs. Ost,
that the view in that direction
is an exquisite one?”
And though the mother did
not turn to look, Ariadne
Hilton quickly moved, ran, ran,
ran, reached her house, barred
the door, double-barred it with
the crucifix of her body.
Silence.
Then there came the whinny-
ing laugh, the boy echoing his
mother in dreadful duet. The
mother shouted, “Might ’ave
bled to your death! But to-
morrow you’ll sing and play
pretty. Tomorrow!”
Silence, silence.
When she was sure they had
gone, after a long while, the
woman behind the door released
the vulgarity and shame of
her sobs.
Night is the time for plans
which day miscolors to dreams,
wild dreams and vain.
TyEVERTHELESS, the next
' morning Ariadne Hilton
put on gloves and bonnet, took
the basket of toys she had
packed at hopeful midnight,
and began to walk to Martha
Ost’s.
For a while the cat followed
until contempt of the too clear
truth of day overcame curiosity.
It turned attention to its own
delighting fur and sat to test
and clean it. So the woman left
the animal behind in the sun,
and with it the well-phrased


pleas midnight anguish had
dictated to her as irresistible.
She told herself that Martha
Ost would relish and mock and
deny her requests but walked
on, lonely, lonely, and lonelier,
her eyes set in dark circles,
each step tarnishing one more
night truth to a morning lie.
I cannot go on, I must go
back, she thought, I must not
be derided further, but the road
of duty moved under her feet,
the trees went by, the house
with its chimney-smoke gush-
ing perpendicularly came in
sight and, for the first time, she
faltered. Stopped.
As she stopped, ahead of her,
noiselessly as an unclean spirit,
a native detached himself from
the bush.
From his tallness and a
sliding limp she recognised
the native who most terrified
her of the near-by tribe
he was the strangest, the
most solitary, the most
demoniac in appearance with
eyes that were those of an idol
of carnage, the whites blood-
steeped to crimson, the irises
glaring purple, shot with cruelty.
A statue of terror, she saw him
lope with wolfish purpose
towards Martha Ost’s house,
nothing abject or of the sidling
beggar in his motion. His body
was striped and circled with
muck ; feathers were plugged in
his filth-clotted ringlets so that
he seemed to wear a feminine
pompadour whose quaking
fragility was hideous above his
brutal masculinity, the feral
silence of his muscles, the
rigid convexity of his belly.
As she stood, movement for-
gotten, her mind suddenly
startled her with delight, a
sickness of pleasure pervaded
her, she wished to laugh, an
ecstatic sweat soaked her
gloves and bubbled deliciously
out upon her forehead. This
striding death and lust was the
unwanted guest she had bitterly
and remorsefully determined
not to pray in the direction of
Martha Ost; this was hatred's
windfall; this was the body
and spear to hunt down a
huntress, and this was the
ultimate darkness a clock could
knit if one waited. “Go on,”
her lips and her heart whis-
pered. “On ...on.. .on .. .”
Thus might an effigy of Malice
have passionately exhorted
through moveless lips.
The house did not disin-
tegrate before the approach of
catastrophe; it remained neutral
In the neutral sunlight. Against
the Great Wall of trees rose a
Wordsworthian smoke from the
altar of domestic simplicity.
No priestess appeared. No jimp
housewife appeared with a
pewter jug. No Martha Ost
flaunted to the open door.
Meantime, meantime, no
interfering dog or angel gave
warning.
The whispering statue
remained a statue: “On, on.
On, on, on.”
The native stopped. He had
seen.
Agape in the potato patch
was the boy who had wasted
her scent and trampled her
English flowers. Among his
father’s plants, too, he had
lashed and ravaged with his
five-year-old body but now
stood sated, interested in the
new arrival. Was he grinning
in the ordinary light and the
usual morning hour? No
sound in the world, and both
boy and man transfixed as she.
Then, with a complete and
graceful movement whose
power and lunacy shocked her
like a blow on the heart’s very
substance, the native threw the
spear. She heard the faultless
knock as it smashed into the
creel of the boy’s chest,-hurling
him to earth. The spear, a
vertical and leafless plant,
vibrated in its plot of flesh.
What wind shook and
thrummed it? What wind
precipitated Martha Ost to the
door?
HTHE mother’s appalling
scream, acquainting Nature
with her deprivation, itself
speared and gouged the
exquisite air, piercing the
entrails of heaven, demanding
cessation from all, rebuking
the living to an eternity of
refrigerated postures which
nevertheless instantly disjointed
themselves to movement.
With her crazed mother’s
arms aloft Martha Ost hurtled
towards the murderer ; he leapt
to meet as though she were
fulfilment.
Behind him, the statue on
the road also moved, began to
race noiselessly, a gloved and
bonneted huntress whose thighs
seemed to her to slice vividly
through her petticoats and
skirt as though she wore air.
As she skimmed nearer to the
centre of the grisly arena she
heard the hoarse and savage
groaning of the hideously-
wrestling mother, the glut-
tonous barkings of the man.
Which one was death? As he
tore at the neck of her dress,
ripping downwards the bark
of bodice so that the large
white breasts sprang about,
Martha Ost hooked her
maddened claws into the
coiffure of feathers and
rubbish. He kicked her,
thrashed her to the ground with
his devil’s arms. At the same
moment his nerves told him of
the huntress at his back. He
wheeled.
Late, too late.
Ariadne Hilton was already
killing with the axe she had
snatched up, the blade was
already there; it sliced across
his nose. and eyes as into a
crisp-rinded melon. Metal and
bone a moment married; next
the rancid body and the reeking
blade parted . . . flesh to earth,
axe to air. With no thought of
anything, ratifying justice with
fervor and strength, she swung
the blade down on the painted
earth-fallen arm, across the
wrist so that the hand leapt
away among the potato-plants,
and blood spouted after it in
a last connecting arc which
broke and fell instantly.
Finis, and finis so quickly
that the native still seemed to
occupy her vision, tigerish,
arched, twisting to scald her
with his blood-drowned purple
look of astonishment, his
ladybird-spotted snarl, brilliant
fangs and criminal childishness.
Then she saw again the
vacancy of chaste air behind
which shone the house, and, at
its door, the second child
laughing uproariously at the
game of slaughter.
Ariadne Hilton swooped to
the woman who had tortured
her, began to lift her, enfold
her in pity-empowered arms,
soothe and control the con-
vulsed swastika of limbs and
life.
Sorrow volted her: “Please,
Mrs. Ost,” she said. “Please,
Mrs. Ost, calm yourself. I am
here. I am here.”
When the two horsemen*
husbands returned several
hours later the native’s body
lay where it had been struck
down, shimmering verd-
antique with a coating of flies
and resonant with their eulogy.
But Ariadne Hilton had tidied
everything else up.
The rinsed axe stood out-
side the door of calm.
The boy’s body had been
cleaned, too, was plugged and
laid out correctly beneath a
table-cloth, the eyelids kept
down with shells.
The kettle sang, the smoke
rose, the luncheon-dishes were
washed, a magpie gargled
melodiously, the living child
broke up peacefully the toys
the visitor had given it, the
mother in another dress suckled
her baby, Ariadne Hilton sewed
firmly at the torn bodice. Noth-
ing to say, nothing—suckling
and sewing, each woman might
have been alone, settled to a
task never to end, in a bliss
nothing could taint.
"OUT the instant the horses
were heard, both of the
women lifted their heads, which
seemed weighted, faced each
other, looked into each other s
eyes without passion.
Then Ariadne Hilton ceased
sewing, stuck the needle in
the cloth, removed her thimble,
folded the garment on a chair,
put on bonnet and gloves,
picked up her basket and
walked to the door. There she
said what she had come to say
and what her eyes had already
said and what the other had
already understood :
“Should you need further
help, Mrs. Ost, there is nothing
more that I can do for you.
There are other females than
I. While I shall not deny aid
in a crisis, pray understand”—
and here her voice took flight
and flashed its knifelike wings
—“pray understand that from
this day forward I shall not be
at home to callers. Not at
home, you understand. Good-
bye, Mrs. Ost.”
The door empty.
Gone.
Gone lightly, swiftly, un-
shackled, humming a song,
towards the house both women
knew Martha Ost would never
enter again, for she, now and
tomorrow and always, was as
hobbled and gagged by grati-
tude as her victim had been.
The flies on the native’s body
set up a roar as Lieutenant Ost
passed it running to the door;
hearing him his wife began to
scream, and he thought he
understood why.
THE MIRROR
Tomorrow and tomorrow and your face
{moon of the sky or weeping asteroid)
here in my dreams looks every hour away—
the mirror floats your image like a wish.
The mirror floats your image till the eyes
stare from the deep, the Neptune-crowded sea —•
a drunk man stands like Hamlet, thinking, while
Ophelia in the mirror lives and dies.

eating their seed-potatoes and conse-
quently starving, dressing themselves
in floral pyjamas which they never
washed, wearing two strands of bush-
string as a cure for backache, camping
on a “midden” in the Crocodile Islands
twenty feet high and five hundred
square yards in extent, harnessing
ghosts to help them in their hunting,
making tolerably nourishing food out
of poisonous yams which give them
headaches, getting delirious on cycad-
cakes, catching fish by poison or
herding them in grass fences, curing
snakebite by catching the snake and
hanging it in a tree . . . and with their
arts and crafts and songs, their magical
practices and their myths it all makes
an exceptionally authoritative and
comprehensive picture of the Arnhem
Landers’ way of life.
In style and method the book errs
a little on the side of modesty. There
are not enough of the personal
adventures and impressions of the
Chaselings, which, besides doing justice
to the missionaries, could have made
the story more vivid and immediate.
But it remains pleasantly readable and
often enough, in its quiet way,
astonishing.
Nutmeg and Ebony
The elegant and capricious Muse of
Ethel Anderson, who has sung of
Australian stockmen named Eustace
and Silas, of pioneers in the near-
Sydney countryside, of “Sunday at
Yarralumla” and of a famous swearing
cockatoo, is occupied in The Song of
Hagar to the Patriarch Abraham
(Edwards and Shaw) with the ancient
Biblical tragedy indicated in the title:
Hagar, Sarah’s handmaid, who bore a
son, Ishmael, to Abraham, and then
was turned out into the desert by the
ungrateful patriarch.
Mrs. Anderson is a subtle and a wily
writer, and it never does to take her
too lightly. When she seems at her
most guileless in her pastoral poems
she is always likely to be giodelling
herself upon Horace and writing some
Latin metre as intricate as it is rare.
Here she seems to follow Ezra Pound
in the opening lines:—
In a bright light, the exchange of
crowns,
In a-bright light, the Invocation of
the Seven Blessings.
In a bright light, the wine-cup—
and, of course, the “Song of Solomon”
in:—
Your body was ivory, nutmeg and
ebony,
Your body was the clamor of
siroccos and whirlwinds . . .
There may be other sources too
numerous or too recondite to mention.
But the proof of the most exotic
pudding is in the eating; and “The
Song of Hagar” eats with a nice
crunch and then, too soon, dissolves.
On the one hand there is the charm
of cadence and incantation:—
Your left foot was a cooking fire, a
flame among the date-palms,
The Pascal Lamb’s savour, the smoke
of the Trespass Ram,
In the Wilderness,
In the desert sand.
And your right foot was frost,
And your right foot was frost,
In the Wilderness,
In the desert sand.
And on the other hand there is the
impression that this is really rather too
easy a way of writing verse once you
have got the knack of it.
On the one hand there is the beauti-
fully clear, simple language and the
colorful Eastern imagery:—
Your love was the murmur of bees
in the almond trees
And of sparrows singing in the
Hasty - tree you planted in
Hebron,
Your love was the rock-thrush that
sits alone on the house-top.
Your mouth was the yellow crocus
in the valley of Sharon . . .
And on the other hand there is the
feeling that all this has been done so
often before; is all contained indeed,
however surprisingly Mrs. Anderson
may vary it at times, in the “Song of
Solomon.”
On the one hand, again, there are the
variety of the verse-forms and
the declamatory representations of
emotional states (which, combined,
have presumably moved John Antill
to compose for the poem a full
orchestral and vocal score); and on
the other hand there is the lack of
individual portraiture which alone can
give true dramatic movement.
It is a pretty piece of work, and
there are moments of force; but it has
neither the compelling interest nor the
solidity of Mrs. Anderson’s prose in
the “Indian Tales” and the Parramatta
stories.
"This Is Australia"
This Is Australia, edited and pro-
duced by Oswald Ziegler (Ziegler
Publications; Angus and Robertson),
is a compilation so enormous, so
beautiful (in many respects) and so
harrowingly commercial that it puzzles
a reviewer to know why it was made
and what anybody is expected to do
with it.
Printed on art-paper and decorated
with line-drawings, photographs, some
color-plates and some ingenious photo-
montages, it opens with an account of
the aborigines, then the discovery and
development of Australia, then the
capital cities, a survey of various indus-
tries, a word or two on the theatre,
something about sport and the Olympic
Games, a special chapter on New Aus-
tralians and finally a note on scientific
research and “Australians in the
Future.”
It mentions that admirable institu-
tion the Sydney Water Board (which
has not yet taken its sewers to St. Ives);
it mentions the Sydney Opera House
(which it hopefully calls a “National”
opera house); it roves to the Antarctic
and New Guinea; it discusses the
Snowy River scheme: altogether a
pretty comprehensive survey of the
national life, though the innocent
reviewer must continue to wonder why
one kind of blankets is mentioned and
not another, one kind of stockings and
not another, one pub in Melbourne and
one in Brisbane out of all the scores
of desirable hostelries that adorn the
capital cities.
Perhaps these are typical industries
and hotels; perhaps they are leading
ones. Perhaps the whole book would
do very well as a picture of con-
temporary Australia. But, then, to
grasp the picture you have to be able
to read the letterpress, the style of
which might be exemplified in one
resounding sentence, “Australia may
justly be proud of her canned-fruits
industry.” It varies from the chatty:
There’s an astonishing amount of
culture in Australia. We have poets,
writers and artists of world class.
We have actors, dancers, singers,
playwrights and producers. There
is, in our make-up, a definite respect
for letters, and a definite love of
good literature ...
to that of the official handout:—
While the N.S.W. power system is
largely thermal in character for its
base load operations, hydroelectric
power is also developed from water
stored mainly for irrigation
purposes . . .
and to the frankly commercial: —
Visitors from all parts of the world
are made welcome at this modern
factory “by mountain and sea”
where they are able to view the wide
variety of Cadbury Chocolates—
Dairy Milk blocks, Milk Tray
boxes . . ,
What’s it for? You can’t take it
home and read it, unless you can read
official handouts. Perhaps you could
distribute it to overseas embassies, but
that seems a little unkind to the
thousand-and-one commercial firms
who don’t get a mention in it. Perhaps
you could display it as a bait for New
Australians, but it really seems unfair
to tell them (whatever may be said to
be lurking in the Oberon dam) that
they can habitually catch 141 b.
and 161 b. trout in New South Wales.


Children would love to cut it up for
their “projects,” but they would hardly
be welcome to cut up a book priced at
£2 10s.
It would, no doubt, make a hand-
some gift-book for a businessman. It
would lie elegantly upon a dentist’s
waiting-room table. It must be intended
to serve some such worthy purpose;
but in a country where we have “an
astonishing amount of culture” one
cannot help feeling that it should have
been infinitely better written. Even a
survey of industry and public works,
even advertisements for chocolates,
cars, silk-stockings and hotels, can be
written with charm and grace.
Algeranoff and Pavlova
Algeranoff’s My Years with Pavlova
(Heinemann), though it is almost a
town-by-town account of his tours, is
fascinating mainly for its study of the
great dancer who, to him and the other
members of his troupe, appeared some-
what as a goddess and not a little as
the kindly headmistress of a finishing-
school.
For, of course, the new members of
her company had to be trained to her
style and satisfaction, to when she
would say, at the end of a rehearsal,
, “All right.” Algeranoff, when he
joined her quite large company in 1921,
an English boy who was immediately
given his present name by Pavlova’s
husband and manager, M. Dandre, had
still a great deal to learn, and is shown
studying Russian dances under Russian
members of the troupe. And not only
this, but during their tour of Japan,
Pavlova went to great pains to have
him study Japanese dancing under
Japanese masters, and even took some
lessons herself.
But as with most great artists,
Pavlova was less anxious to learn a
complete new style and repertoire of
dancing than to find something in
foreign dancing that she could adapt
to her own style; and if “Butterfly,”
which gives the most beautiful photo-
graph of Pavlova to this book, was
derived from something she saw in
Japanese dancing it could hardly have
been more than an impression. Her
Indian dances, on the other hand, seem
to have followed more closely Indian
style and dressing, except that Algera-
noff leaves one with the impression
that the Indian dancing the Pavlova
company saw in India was so poor
that they were able to create almost
completely what are now recognised
as Indian dances.
Present everywhere in this book as
a kind of goddess, visiting rehearsals
to make only an occasional and for
that reason much-valued comment, and
then vanishing back to first-class suites
or staterooms out of sight of ordinary
dancers, Pavlova seems to have had a
singularly laconic charm, handing out
cigarette-cases, or watches, or, in India,
a trip to the Taj Mahal, as Christmas
presents, turning 64 fouettes to inspire
a practising girl with her contempt for
them, watching over the public com-
portment of her people:—
“Last night, Algy, we go to Opera,
and in interval I say to Liza, ‘Look,
this crazy person wear pink tie!
Look like Algy!’ and Liza say, ‘lt
is Algy.’ Really, you should know
better, Algy, if not in evening dress
at least must wear dark tie.”
But she was quite capable of
disorganising her company just as the
curtain was due to go up with
a full-scale imitation of Charlie
Chaplin. In her lovely white tutu she
jigged up and down swinging an
imaginary walking-stick and raising
an imaginary bowler-hat. The curtain
went up on a somewhat ragged
corps de ballet. ... .while Madame
herself remained in the wings cheer-
fully grinning at our discomfort.
His finest description of her dancing
is of Giselle in Chicago, when her acting
of the mad girl was “terrifying,” and
rehearsals were “electrifying”:—
Once she was so possessed that
she took hold of one of the peasant
girls and gripped her by the throat.
Her hands tightened until the poor
girl’s eyes began to bulge Joan
.. ; . .had to hobble over the stage and
separate them. I shall never forget
the terrible emptiness in Pavlova’s
stare —so intense that it seemed to
fill the theatre.
Although he became Pavlova’s
partner, Algeranoff never tries to take
the stage for himself in this book, a
rare spirit of humility which affords
the reader a plain and unaffected view
of a ballet-dancer’s life, full of extra-
ordinarily interesting details of life on
tour in Europe, America, Africa, India,
South-eastern Asia and, of course, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. Sydney was
then, about 1926, as possibly now, the
appropriate place in the book to
reflect:—
And how dull Sunday can be with-
out friends in a city where there is
nothing to do!
It was also where he went to Paling’s
Buildings to give a lesson to “a pale-
faced young man with sleek black hair
and rather prominent eyes,” and to
advise him to call himself “Robert”
instead of “Bobbie,” and add an “n”
to “Helpman”—although, he says
darkly, “I’ve heard it said that it was
given him by a gipsy—a nomad would
have made the story more exact!”
And in Sydney,
When “Bacchanale” ended the
curtain came down without a single
hand-clap. Expressing my surprise
to a Sydney acquaintance, I was
told that the subject of the dance
was unpleasant!
Was it any wonder they had six-
o’clock closing?
THE CORNER
The lover watches the corner
Round which his mistress ought to come,
Wondering what can harm her,
Who makes the odd or even sum
Of minutes, seconds, dragging,
Into a round and perfect thing.
He does not care for angles,
When right, to him they seem most wrong;
Height walks for him on ankles
And distance lies however long
It is since he has seen her,
For love makes all perspectives leaner.
The corner chops its segment
Of mystery out of all his days;
Although the World's a figment
Of his own sad or happy gaze
Its roundness, or her own,
Will never bend a corner stone.

Reviewed Briefly
On the Beach: Nevil Shute (Heine-
mann). The little group in Melbourne
who await annihilation by the radio-
active waves after an atomic war are
really stock types from Nevil Shute’s
pen, but here they take on significance
as being ordinary men and women
facing an extraordinary situation; The
story is depressing, but the suspense is
well maintained and there are amusing
incidents and characters, especially the
old General, who is determined to
drink up all the club’s port before the
end of the world and who strongly
disapproves of opening the trout-season
early. “I think it’s a terrible proposal,”
he says, “quite irresponsible. I’m sure
I don’t know what the world’s coming
to!”

The Art of the Dramatist: J. B.
Priestley (Heinemann). This was the
inaugural lecture under the Hubert
Henry Davies fund given at the Old
Vic in 1956. A good deal of it looks
rather like special pleading; e.g., Mr.
Priestley’s suspicions of the poetic
drama and his belief that it is a mistake
for English companies touring over-
seas always to present Shakspeare—
whose plays, indeed, he thinks are too
much presented in London. Still, he
makes his points. It is an interesting
survey of the present state of the
English theatre, with, at the end, a
strong argument in favor of the estab-
lishment of “arena-theatres.”

Wasted lives. Y<w <"///<?/• 3><w our had roads are contributing to accident after accident.
Scores of Australians are being killed or permanently injured. To cope with the ever-
increasing flow of modern fast-moving traffic, today’s roads must be straight and wide
so that both pedestrian- and motorist can enjoy greater safety.

Wasted time, Bad roads cause costly delays. Frustrating
delays in congested traffic, at rail crossings, on long slow
hauls up steep narrow inclines . . . these and many other
faults in our road system help push up the prices of
goods and services which are ultimately passed on to
you forcing up your cost of living.
Higher food bills. 76 c fo of all freight is carried by road
of which food is a major item. It is estimated that the
cost of freight is 6/- in every pound you spend on con-
sumer goods. Good roads would substantially reduce this
freight cost even by half.
YOU ARE PAYING millions of pounds a year for
Australia’s thousands of miles of crumbling, out-moded
roads and congested city streets. Lives are lost every
day through unsafe rail crossings, narrow bridges,
dangerous crests and other hazards. Don’t you agree
it’s time we did something about it ?
Australia has the engineers, the manpower, the
ingenuity and all the means to build good roads. Now
we need a blueprint for further action.
Ail Australian National Roads Authority, a single
body backed by the necessary powers and funds, could
be the first step in bringing our roads into line with
today’s ... and tomorrow’s requirements. Such an
Authority could co-ordinate the plans of existing state
and shire road-making bodies who are doing their
best under great difficulties to keep our roads open
so that our road construction programme keeps pace
with other phases of national development.
Good roads don’t cost they pay !
