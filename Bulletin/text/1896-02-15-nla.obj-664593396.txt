J. M. Barrie’s new novel, “The Story of Senti-
mental Tommy,” which commences in Jan.
Ss'iiiisNER S, does not promise well. It is not
sp nit me. m<. and in the over-elaboration of trivial
incident t a- desired haven of humor is missed
Notes.
One hardly looks to Pinero for originality of
thought, but he frequently compasses originality
of expression. Here are some bits from “The
Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ’’
How many “coming men ” has one known? Where on
earth do they all go to ?
Oh, Agnes, the agony of success to a nervous, sensitive
man ; the dismal apprehension that fills his life and gives
each victory a voice to cry out “Hear, hear! Bravo,
bravo, bravo! But this is to be your last —you’ll never
overtop it! ’’
Oh, these modern nurses, in their greys, or browns, and
snowy bibs! They have much to answer for, dear Lucas.
Ah, Duke, when you all carry out your repressive
legislation against women of evil lives, don’t fail to in-
clude in your schedule the Unsympathetic Wives. They
are the women whose victims show the sorriest scars;
they are the really “ bad women ’’ of the world : all the
others are snow-white in comparison !
Men don’t relish, I suppose, being cast off by women*
It’s an inversion of the picturesque ; the male aban-
doned is not a pathetic figure.
Dear Bulletin, —“The Old Ma’m’selle’sSdcret’’
is a German novel, the title in the original being
“Das Geheimniss der Alten Mamsell ” (“The
Old Maid’s Secret ”). It is written by a woman
named Marlitt, who is, in the delightful native
phrase, a highly-successful-and-by-the-public-
deservedly-much-beloved. authoress. The story is
chiefly concerned with the adopted daughter of a
respectable shopkeeper, who inconsiderately dies
and leaves her to the tender mercies of.hjj widow.
The girl is badly treated by the family, but ulti-
mately turns out to be a sprig of nobility under a
cloud, and marries the inevitable German pro-
fessor amid a hailstorm of Du and Dieh, there-
after bearing children with true Teutonic rapidity.
In point of literary excellence, Marlitt is about
on a par with Miss Braddon, whom she somewhat
resembles, as far as a traditional German style
can resemble anything. However, she affords a
relief from the eternal “philosophy” of many
German novelists. — W.
“ Back from the- Jaws of Death,” hy “ Yarro-
wee” (Is. 3d.), is a-sensational Sydney publica-
tion which has some ingenuity of construction and
a liberal allowance of blood. The Domainer’s
method of going to bed may be compared with
that of Louis XIV. :—
A pile of papers stood by his side as he sat in the grass,
pipe in mouth. Then Carefully, but deftly, he commenced
operations on one leg ; wrapping around it sheet, after
sheet of paper, commencing at, the foot upwards, in much
the same way that a doctor binds up a broken limb with
lint after the splints have been fixed in their place. This
done, his other leg underwent a similar operation. Then
each having been dialt with separately, both were
encased together by more sheets of paper on the
same principle. The body next received attention. By
a dexterous wriggling of the arms, quite astonishing
to one uninitiated in the process, in a few moments the
task was complete. Many of these paper parcels, with
heads showing up at one end, can be seen in the Domain
during any summer night. Their only pillow is a friendly
elevation of the ground, or the sack in which they have
carried their papers. From the head of each of these
figures in their paper couches, little rings of white smoke
curl up as, at regular intervals, they puff away at the
soothing weed.
Anarchist Andrews issues, at Melbourne, the
first number of Reason, “ a monthly magazine of
social and general philosophy ” (3s. 6d. per year),
which contains more hard thought to the square-
inch than any other periodical on the continent.
Andrews is a purist in style as well as in ethics,
and his reasoning has lucidity and pith.
Sydney Telegraph of Jan. 25 notes in its
“ Books up to Date ” column that—
MacMillan’s [sic] introduce us to the first volume of the
“ History of the English People,” now being written by
John Richard Green, M.A., Fellow of Oxford ; of which
the style is so attractive that the remaining seven will be
looked f<'r, even by the general reader, with genuine
pleasure.
Poor Green ! His “ Short History ” was pub-
lished in ’74 ; his “History ” in ’77-’80. He is a
text-book; a classic ; reprinted a score of times ;
surfeited with the applause of the multitude, the
esteem of critics. And a “great Australian daily
newspaper ” pats him approvingly as a rising
author with an attractive style! If only free
Govt, trains carried the Telegraph across the
Styx, how his ghost (over since ’83) would
chuckle !
A leading Sydney firm furnishes the following
list of books in order of greatest wholesale demand
during February :
1. Corelli's “Sorrows of Satan.”
2. Paterson’s “Man from Snowy River.”
3. Crawford’s “Casa Braccio.”
4. Haggard’s “Joan Haste.”
5. Gould’s “On and Off the Turf.”
6. Du Maurier’s “ Trilby.”
7. Kipling’s “ Second Jungle Book.”
8. Turner’s “Seven Little Australians” and " Family
at Misrule.”
9. Maolaren’s “ Days of Auld Lang Syne.”
10. Crookett’s " Sweetheart Travellers.”
Roll Boldrevvood’s next story will have Western
Victoria as a background. Browne used to know
the country very well indeed in his younger days,
but has not been there for many years. He is
now refreshing his memories. Western Vic.
has not hitherto cut much of a figure in literature.
Gordon used t<> ride in steeple-chases there : “ On
the fields of C tier line there’ll be labor in vain
before the Great Western is ended ’’—and so on ;
but the fiction wf -the-distrfct is, so far, limited to
ex-Premier Shields famous Casterton speech with
its unrealised programme.
Henry Lauson's Poems.
Henry Lawson joins “The Banjo” in Angus
and Robertson’s admirable Australian series. In
these two writers, with all their imperfections, we
see something like the beginnings of a national
school of poetry. In them, for the first time,
Australia has found audible voice and characteris-
tic expression.
* * * *
Passing a few verses scattered over our litera-
ture’s single century, the name of Kendall is the
only one to be cited in opposition to this view.
Domett and Gordon were aliens in birth and
thought. The same is true of Stephens, happily
still with us. Their poems are not Australian
poems, but poems about Australia —or Austral-
asia, if it be objected that Domett’s epic deals
wholly with Maoriland (though the literary limi-
tation of “ Australia ” to the continent has doubt-
ful validity). Naturally, they reflect their acci-
dental environment. Domett, feeling the poetic
impulse, apostrophises the Maoris just as he would
have apostrophised Red Indians had his lot been
cast in America. Gordon’s “ Sick Stockrider ’’
might easily have been a “Sick Gaucho ” ; he
could have ridden “From the Wreck” without
leaving England, and with a few verbal changes
he could have written it there. Take away the
title “Convict Once” and the constellations, and
Stephens’s masterpiece is cosmopolitan.
*■ * * *
But Kendall ? Kendall comes closer to the
heart of Australian things, yet does not quite
reach it. For he preserves always his indivi-
duality : not Australia, but Kendall, strikes the
dominant note in Kendall’s verses. So susceptible
a soul could not, indeed, fail to be influenced by
the voices sweet and stern which called him on
every hand. But though these thrilled, they did
not fill him. Australia colored, beautified, some-
times inspired his poems, but never swayed,
mastered, wholly possessed the poet.
* * » *
With Paterson and Lawson it is different. The
men are subordinate to their themes. In Ken-
dall’s best verses —the sonnets: “ To a Mountain ; ”
the personal lyrics—the interest is subjective, it is
brought by Kendall himself. Even in bis descrip-
tive pieces— “ Moohi,” “ < >rara,” “Coogee”—we
are less concerned with tlie scenery than with the
poet’s relation to the scenery. But Paterson’s
and Lawson’s best verses are objective, imper-
sonal. The interest is in the poem, not in the
poet. Kendall, Paterson and Lawson have each
held a mirror to their native land. Kendall’s
reflects his own image and Australia’s ; Paterson’s
and Lawson’s reflect Australia’s.
* * * *
This is true of both, but it is more true of
Paterson. Yet, though Lawson’s later verses are
largely colored by bis own thoughts and emotions,
the bulk of his book is Australian, and it is
when he is most Australian that he is most happy.
This amounts to saying—what is perfectly true—
that his earlier poems are among his best. It is
curious to note the contrast between Lawson’s
optimism of seven years ago and his pessimism of
to-day. In 1889 “ The Ghost ” vanished
. , . as a purer brighter presence trained my side—
“ Heed him not 1 there’s truth and friendship in this
wondrous world,” she cried,
“ And of those who cleave to virtue in their climbing for
renown,
Only they who faint or falter from the height are shaken
down.
At a cynic’s baneful teaching let your lip in scorn be
curled!
‘ Brotherhood and Love and Honor ! ’ is the motto for the
world! ”
In 1895, “ The Ghost” has returned—to stay.
And is it for this damned life (1) vve praise the god-like
spirit that died
At Eureka Stockade in the Roaring Days with the days
when the world was wide?
* * * •
The change of note from Hope to Discontent,
the change of view from impersonal to personal,
have not improved Lawson’s poetry. The less he
broods the better he writes. It was before he
soured that he wrote “ Andy’s Gone with Cattle”
(1888), “The Glass on the Bar” (1890), “When
the Children Come Home ” (1890), and “ The
Drover’s Sweetheart ” (1890), and there is nothing
in his book superior to these. “ The Vagabond,”
which may be taken as typical of Lawson’s later
attitude, is a fine piece, with some splendidly
sonorous stanzas, but—there are so many sucking
Byrons busy at monotonous variations of the
bitter old theme. And the Lawson who wrote
“ The Drover’s Sweetheart ” is unique.
* * * *
Lawson’s shortcomings are obvious enough.
His mental scope is narrow ; he is comparatively
uncultured ; he iterates the same notes, and rarely
improves his thought by elaboration; he wants
harmony and variety of metre; his work is bur-
dened with many weak lines and careless tags.
But how graphic be is, how natural, how true,
how strong ! How he feels, and makes his readers
feel, in poems like “Out Back ! ” when phrase by
phrase is painted an imperishable bush picture.
Lawson’s shortcomings are obvious; but, for
Australians, they are as nothing beside his merits.
And it must be remembered that his verse repre-
sents only half of his work, and perhaps not the
finer half. His prose, brimming with humor and
pathos, is of the best produced in Australia.
* * * *
Lawson’s keen sympathy, his knack of observa-
tion, are characteristically feminine. His sense of
humor, his talent for vivid portrayal, are as
characteristically masculine. Yet it is the woman
in him, as in others, that makes his talent glow
to the white heat of genius. Intell et is great ;
emolion is great; but, for a poet, the greater of
them is emotion. This it is which fires dull
words, turns ore into gold, and, Pygmalion-like,
draw's .with passionate ardor from cold stone
warm, pulsating life. This
adds the gleam,
The light that never was, on sea or land,
The consecration, and the Poet s dream.
His <j .plenty for emotion is Lawaop’s best gift.
It i- because he feels so deeply that he writes so
strongly. His life has been a struggle and it is a
struggle still; but, mayhap, had fortune been
easier, his work would have failed so to move
us. For the oases of literature are watered with
tears and blood, and a people preys upon its poets’
vitals.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON- |
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from wtiich I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tainworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly' and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

THE
Angelus Symphony.
fPHE Symphony is a keyboard instrument for general use, and
is also an automatio instrument reproducing mechanically
the notes of any music supplied. Thousands of pieces have been
prepared for the instrument and new selections continually
added, embracing the writings of the celebrated composers of
the past and composers of the present day, combining classical,
operatic, saored, dat.ce and popular music, all of which can be
peiformed upon the Symphony by a person having no know-
ledge whatever of music. While this is a wonderful advance-
ment over any m< chanical instrument heretofore made, therejs
in connection with the Symphony additional possibilities which
commend it to the educated musician.
The Symphony is fast becoming a factor in the conservatory
of music. The correct reading of a difficult passage in a vocal
c r instrumental piece can be taught more readily to the pupil
from a demonstration upon the instrument than by any other
method of instruction. Practice has proved this.
Every Set of Reeds in the Symphony is operated by the Key-
board ; also every set is brought into use by the Automatio
attachment, whereby the full power of the instrument is
obtained if used either way.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT THE BACK O’ BOURKE.
Where the mulga paddocks are wild and wide,
That’s where the pick of the stockmen ride,
At the Back o’ Bourke,
Under the dust-clouds dense and brown,
Moving Southward by tank and town,
That’s where the Queensland mobs come down,
Out at the Back o’ Bourke.
Over the Border to and fro,
That’s where the footsore swagmen go,
At the Back o’ Bourke ;
Sick and tired of the endless strife,
Nursing the bones of a wasted life
Where all the sorrows of Earth are rife,
Out at the Back o’ Bourke.
Whether the plains are deep or dry,
That’s where the struggling teams go by
At the Back o’ Bourke,
North and Southward, in twos and threes,
Bullocks and horses down to the knees,
Waggons dipped to the axle-trees,
Out at the Back o’ Bourke.
That’s the land of the lying light
And the cruel mirage dancing bright—
At the Back o’ Bourke ;
That’s where the shambling camel tram
Crosses the Western ridge and plain,
Loading the Paroo clips again,
Out at the Back o’ Bourke.
That’s the land of the wildest nights,
The longest sprees and the fiercest fights,
At the Back o’ Bourke ;
That’s where the skies are brightest blue,
That’s where the heaviest work’s to do,
That’s where the fires of Hell burn through,
Out at the Back o’ Bourke.
That’s where the widest floods have birth
Out of the nakedest ends of Earth,
At the Back o’ Bourke,
Where poor men lend and the rich ones borrow;
It’s the bitterest land of sweat and sorrow,
But if I were free I’d be off to-morrow
Out at the Back o’ Bourke.
GLENROWAN.
A REFLECTION ON BRERETON’S “RE-
FLECTION ON LAWSON’S POEMS.”
“ Seasons bloom and seasons wither; dark or
bright, they cannot last; ”
I suppose, my noble Brereton, you think that
patter “ fast; ”
But it’s stale as hash-house “resurrection”remnants
of the past.
Let the seasons slide ? Of course, sir; ’cos you’ve
got to and they will 1
Not the seasons are the matter, but the chances
that they kill;
He’s a fool who dreams past chances are the pre-
sent chances still!
Go it, merry, Brerry gallant, go it rattling while
you’re young,
Tell the girls their kisses bellows-up the love-songs
on your tongue,
Tell your mates, and fool yourself, too, that “we
never can go bung.” >
Look around you, Brerry songster, where the
friends are of your past;
Men whose gifts of brilliant promise limned a
future ne’er outclassed;
Read that future in their present. Don’t it make
you stand aghast ?
Dux, who should have been a Potentate, by future
then read clear,
Lurks at corners on the roadway of the daily path
you steer,
Tugs your elbow softly, humbly, as he tries to
“ bite your ear. ”. ...
Same with Vox and Jus and others, who were
leaders in their prime,
And who held, like you, my Brerry, that the pre-
sent is a chime,
That the flow’rs and girls and rainbows are a
merry pantomime.
’Cos their hearts were light and open, opened they
their purses, too,
’Cos they whooped the whoop of “ Now’s-the-
time,” they paid the reck’ning due,
Let us hope, my Brerry buster, such a fate won’t
happen you.
“Seasons bloom arid seasons wither ! ” Yes, but
Man has only one
Set of seasons in his lifetime— Spring and Summer
—then he’s don^j
Then comes harvesting and winter ! Where’s his
chance of future fun ?
If he’s grabbed his pile and kept it, shut his ears
to woes of peasant;
Made his joys from others’ sorrows, shut his eyes
to things unpleasant;
Then he may (if glut permit it in the bloated !)
“ sing the present. ”
Men don’t bloom again when once they start to
wither; Winter’s blast
Never starts the Spring’s soft zephyr in a life once
overcast —
And the wrecks—that’s all the Poets—thus can
only “ sing the past.”
Blood is ichor ! marrow’s callous! present out-
looks make us freeze—
Sing us Wine and sing us Women —time has
always room for these ;
Let our sinned joys boil to thrill us. Sing the
Past; its Memories !

“Socialism in Our Time.”
The feud which has arisen between the
Queensland Labor-party and the nominal
Opposition, and which seems likely to ensure
the Boodle brigade another long lease of
power and plunder, is a regrettable evidence
of the want of practical common-sense among
the men who preach “Socialism in our
Time.” Concerning their sincerity, their
patriotism, their honesty of purpose, and
their courage and enthusiasm there seems
little doubt ; at least, so far as all the avail-
able evidence goes, the Queensland Labor-
party holds, in these matters, the best and
cleanest record in Australia. But it is
seriously lacking in generalship, and, unless
things in the North are very different from
what they seem, it will find, after the
preaching elections, that it has fooled away
a great opportunity by a too uncompromising
adherence to all its principles at once. This
is, of course, only a probability, not a
certainty ; the Labor-party, despite the fact
that it has virtually thrown overboard its
only ally, and decided to play a lone
hand against the most powerful and
unscrupulous Government in the seven pro-
vinces, may come out victorious, for nothing
is so unexpected that it is dead sure not to
come to pass. A-lso, it might have lost even
with the assistance of the Opposition, for
there is hardly anything so probable that it
may not fail to arrive just when it is most
expected. But if the Labor-party wins its
victory will be much less decisive, and if it
loses its defeat will be more overwhelming
by reason of its present attitude ; and there
is just a fair probability that its lamentable
want of generalship may turn what might
have, been a narrow victory into a decisive
overthrow. The present is not the time
when the Queensland democrats can afford to
quarrel over small—or even moderately large
—differences of opinion, and it is the very
worst time in all the history of the province
to demand “ all or nothing.”
» * * *
The odds in favor of the Government are
very heavy. Its party bosses the biggest
financial institutions of the province, and if
the man who opposes them is indebted to
any of these institutions —which have a large
proportion of Queensland in pawn—he is
liable to be sold up if he doesn’t promptly
cease his opposition. All the people whose
souls and assets are mortgaged to the mone-
tary concerns which the Ministerial party
controls understand that they must vote for
the Government candidate, and work for
him, and boycott, as far as possible, all the
people who work against him. The sugar-
planting interest is bound to the Govern-
ment, for on it depends the supply of cheap
nigger-labor. The pastoral interest is also
with the Government, because the Boodle
Ministry is always ready to put down with
the strong hand real and imaginary labor
“insurrections,” and if it promotes these
alleged insurrections in the first place, in
order that it may put them down afterwards,
and thus win the gratitude of the pastoral
class, that fact generally escapes notice. ■'A
long list of “ proposed ” railways has been
dangled before the electors, and the country
knows its Boodle Government well enough
to understand that while the electorate
which votes for it may get its line,
the one which votes against it certainly
won’t. The Queensland Political Association,
of which Premier Nelson is the head, has
been at work for years past, objecting to the
vote of every Democrat who could possibly
be removed from the roll on any pretext
whatever, and the Revision Courts, which
are merely the instruments of the Boodle
Government, have wiped off nearly every
man whom the Political Association objected
to. Public attention has not been much drawn
to these matters in Parliament because Speaker
Cowley —a Government nomi nee, by the way
—appears to promptly silence, or suspend,
or eject any member who too violently calls
attention to the shady doings of the Ministry.
The Government manages the elections on a
mysterious plan of its own, which somehow
seems to give the Boodle candidate a much
better show than the other man ; and among
all these devices the Democratic Party in the
North has a remarkably hard row to hoe.
* * * *
If the Democratic Party can show that it
has a reasonable chance of winning, it will
gain many adherents who won’t throw in
their lot with it while it is merely a forlorn
hope. In any other of the Australias,
save perhaps W.A., the man or the con-
stituency which adheres to the losing
cause seldom comes to serious grief
thereby, except perhaps that the man
who votes with the Ministry has a better
chance of being appointed a policeman than
the other man. In Queensland the man
who openly supports the Labor cause, or is
suspected of supporting it in secret, is
promptly struck off the roll on the ground
that he is dead, or something of the sort; if
he has a billet he probably loses it ; if he
has an overdraft in an institution which can
be “ influenced ” he is probably sold up ; if
he is a merchant or tradesman the loyal
crowd are very likely warned not to support
him in future; if he runs a paper the
Government advertising is apt to leave him
very suddenly. Therefore, a large number
of people, who would gladly support
the good cause if it were managed in
a way which gave it even a reasonable
show of success, will otherwise stand out.
And the conduct of the Queensland Labor-
party, in breaking up its alliance with the
Opposition over some small points of differ-
ence, reduces its chance of success so much
that the people who have something to lose
by offending the Boodle Ministry will at
least give it no open assistance. The aver-
age man doesn’t want to risk his life in a
forlorn hope, and the Labor cause, as now
managed, practically is one. A party which
throws away its chances so recklessly doesn’t
inspire confidence in its own future.
* * * *
The proposed coalition between the Labor
men and the Oppositionists would have pre-
vented them running candidates against each
other, and would have concentrated the
voting power of the two pai’ties everywhere
upon one candidate. Also, it would have
meant that they would return to Par-
liament to present a solid front to the com-
mon enemy ; and as the Labor element
would constitute probably two-thirds of
the coalition it would have much the
better end of the bargain. Now there will
be no mutual support, and the two
parties will fight against each other
at random, and in this miserable divi-
sion of interests the Boodle Government
will almost certainly score a great success.
The cause of the division was that the
Opposition would not give in its adherence
to the whole policy of “ Socialism in our
Time.” It was ready, however, to give its
solid support to the principle of “ One-Man-
One-Vote ” and to the abolition of nigger
and Kanaka labor. Therefore, if the coali-
tion returned with a majority, it could have
abolished the property vote, given the
suffrage to every male white adult in Queens-
land, and sent a bunch of Democrats to the
Upper House to break up the solid Tory
phalanx there. And then, when the next
general election came round, if the country
wanted “ Socialism in our Time,” every man
would have had a chance to vote for it, and
bring it to pass. The Labor-party holds that
the masses in Queensland want its programme
in its entirety, and if so, the only thing which
prevents that programme becoming law is
the plural vote, and the property-qualifica-
tion, and the wholesale disfranchisement of
the people who want to vote in its favor.
The Labor men cannot remove these dis-
qualifications themselves because so many of
their adherents are disfranchised ; therefore,
to secure their removal they should coalesce
with anybody or everybody who can be ie
upon to support One-man-one-vote, and th
give their party a fair chance to assert itse
Their utter inability to see this obvious fact
is such a pitiable instance of stupic l y ’
the cause of the Queensland Labor-party—
unless it gets a new set of leadeis may e
fairly set down as hopeless.
* * *
If the party takes up its present uncom-
promising attitude because it has pledge
itself to insist on its whole policy and on a
its policy at once, as the price of its alliance
with any other political section, then 1
may as well give up the ghost no poli-
tical body ever got all its policy at once, it
it desires simply to show its incorruptible
honesty, then it would be much more useful
if it was less honest and more politic. If its
reason is that its bosses won’t share the
leadership with anybody else, then it is sacri-
ficing the country to its own selfishness
as well as to its own crass stupidity.
And if, as seems probable, it is travel-
ling on the maxim that the truth is mighty
and must prevail, and that because its cause
is a good one it is bound to come out
uppermost sooner or later, and that a year
or two, or a lost chance or two, don’t matter
while time and Providence are on its side, it
is throwing its priceless opportunity away for
the sake of a threadbare moral wheeze
taken out of a copy-book. The truth is
reasonably mighty and it prevails now and
then. The good cause, if it is well-managed,
comes out on top about as often as the bad
one, but the world is covered with the
wreckage of good causes which, not being
well-managed, didn’t come out on top, and
look as if they never would. If the bad
cause has the best generalship behind it, it
has just the same chance of victory as any
other. If the Queensland Labor-party fools
away this opportunity of upsetting the
Boodle Government, its time may come again
in six months or three years or a century—
no one knows. Possibly in the interval of
waiting the Ministry may find some means
of suppressing the Worker, and may
enact a new franchise which will wipe out
most of what remains of the Labor-vote, or the
nigger-laborer may starve most of the balance
of the white workers out of the country, or
the Japanese invasion may begin in real
earnest, and a big Japanese vote may arise
to down the party which wants Queensland
for the white Australians. Or, again, the
cry of “Socialism in our Time” may die
out, as so many other political watchwords
have done ; and the Labor-party may go to
pieces for no visible cause, as other parties
have done, when they had lost their oppor-
tunity. If the country believes in the Labor
programme, then the first, last and only
thing the party wants is manhood suffrage
pure and simple—that gained, the com-
munity will do the rest at next election.
* * * *
Therefore the Labor-party, if there was
even a fraction of ability among its leaders,
should be willing to sink everything else—
even “ Socialism in our Time a thousand
fathoms deep and out of sight for the present,
and go for manhood suffrage alone, with the
help of anybody who will coalesce with it
on that basis. If it fails to do this the
inevitable public conviction must be that
the party doesn’t want to succeed because
success is the worst thing that could happen
to it. In other words, the public idea will
be that it has no constructive ability and is
aware of the fact; that while it is out of power
it can live on the tale of what its leaders
would do if they were in power, whereas if
they were in power their incapacity to do
anything would inevitably break up their
following, and, therefore, they consider it
better to stay where they are. Anyhow
unless some kind of an agreement can be
arrived at with the moderate men of the
Opposition, the present prospects are bad
A great part of the public has learned from
the Government and its lying organs to
regard Socialism, either in our time or in
any other, as synonymous with blood and
butchery, arson, riot, disorder, and whole-
sale destruction of property. If the Labor-
party announced its willingness for the
present to go for manhood suffrage only, and
to leave the rest to the electors afterwards
it would gam many adherents and make a
good beginning at reform. Its insistence on
its whole programme or nothing only scares
the dull, middle-class element into alliance
with the present Government, for fear that
the only alternative thereto is a GovernnS
ral 6 imaginary gory shearer from
the vv est with a leavening of the incendiary
swagman and rouseabout thrown in. J
Melbourne University Once More.
Ed. Bulletin, -In Oct. last Labor-member
Maloney, in Vic. Assembly, speaking on
the University estimates, advised Educa-
tion-Minister Peacock to bring pressure
on the University so that it might offer
100 scholarships m return for its prim
cipal source of revenue, viz., the Govern-
ment grant and subsidy. Peacock adopted
fbe L folf YS - sug . gest,on > with modifications, and
the following is an extract from the Depart
menial letter to Chancellor Brownless ._! P t_

To the common intellect, Peacock’s proposal
was clear e.,0ug1,-but the cultured brahi o
Brownless found it mystifying of

ment would pay the fees of scholars, or whether the Uni-
versity was to forego them.
At present, the Government provides for 12
scholarships for State-school children each
year, and if Peacock simply wanted an exten-
sion of this practice, he would have said so.
Brownless further went on to say that State-
school scholarships were class scholarships, and
by that fact against the policy of the University
—but lie did not say why such abominations
were already tolerated. As the State-schools
are open to every child in the province, and as
every grade of alleged society uses the State-
schools, it is obvious that the use of the word
“class” with the meaning of exclusiveness or
differentiation is a gratuitous misapplication of
terms. Judge a’Beckett concurred in the mis-
use of the word “ class.” He said :
It would be impolitic to send an illiberal response, but
he thought they might shunt it altogether by pointing out
that it was opposed to the policy of the University to
offer prize money to a limited class.
The precious Council concurred, and carried a
motion accordingly. It is to he seen whether
Peacock will coolly endure such a trumpery
piece of special pleading on behalf of the chief
tool of close corporations.

The Chancellor was aide to show that con-
siderable sums of money had already been
declined in the same terms :
It was against the policy of the University to grant
class scholarships. For that reason the council had
refused an offer of £30,000 from Dr. Graves to endow a
scholarship for Oddfellows and their sons, and an offer
by Mr. Cameron of £20,000 to endow a scholarship for
pupils from the Western district.
It was not stated that the Government was
consulted before this ,£50,000 was rejected, and
the presumption is that Chancellor Brownless
and the council did it “on their own.” I have
no special sympathy with Oddfellows, and my
soul does not yearn for the “ pupils of the
Western District,” but if some benevolent mono-
polist offered my university twenty or thirty
thousand pounds to educationally benefit girls
with strawberry-marks on their left elbows, or
to provide intelligence for bald old gentlemen,
I would have to find some very special reason
that I don’t know at present for refusing.
The University did not refuse to be the go-
between for Salmon Wilson and his knight-
hood—it took the Wilson .£30,000 and built
the Wilson Hall as a standing monument to a
greedy grabber for class distinction. It lays
itself open to grave and frequent accusations of
being nothing more or less than a tool for
accentuating class distinctions with its degrees
and diplomas. For such an institution to inter-
pose pettifogging obstruction to proposals made
by a duly-authorised officer of the public, is to
abuse a trust it is supposed to hold solely and
wholly in the public interest. For persistence
in such a course of action there is only one
remedy.
» * * *
The official University Calendar is very
considerably a record of class distinctions
beginning with the theological colleges and
ending with the University Masonic Lodge.
Such institutions are paraded and advertised
out of the University grant—but the admission
of certain picked pupils from the State schools
to the existing lectures (a matter that would
not entail extra expenditure of one penny) is
something to be fought tooth and nail as savor-
ing of “class.” To what tricks would Melb.
University treat itself if Parliament did not
hold the purse-strings ?-

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Raid on the Transvaal.
Australians are aware that the messages sent
from this country to London by the cable-
agencies are frequently misleading—partly be-
cause few people have the genius to compress a
great situation into a few words, partly because
the despatchers generally take their cue from
the dominant party, or the party which shouts
the loudest. South African cables are more
misleading still. It is a part of the policy of
Rhodes, the would-be dictator, to deliberately
influence public opinion in favor of his projects
by means of the press, and he has systematically
brought under his control, or partial control,
the leading newspapers and telegraphic agencies
of South Africa. The result is that it is
extremely difficult for facts prejudicial to his
policy to filter out at all, while facts favorable
to his policy receive extraordinary prominence.
In connection with the recent attack of Rhodes’s
lieutenant, Jameson, on the Transvaal, for
example, the cables gave the impression
that Johannesburg was seriously threatened
by the Boers; that the grievances under
which its citizens smarted were intoler-
able ; that women and children were
m danger, and that Jameson marched only to
protect life and property. But democratic
outh African papers like the Johannesburg
Diggers News, now to hand, put quite
another face on the story. So far from Jame-
son s incursion being the result of a sudden
impulse, it was arranged weeks previously and
meditated long before. Johannesburg feel-
'nS~as the decision of the Australian meeting
to take no part in hostilities hinted—was
strongly adverse to the raid. Jameson relied
on ie promised assistance of the gang of specu-
lators— the leading spirits are Jews-Iwho rule
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. These

landers’ main grievances are removed. Natur-
ally, the Boers resist the attempt to make them
cipheis in their own country by means of repre-
sentative institutions : if a more numerous
Boer population swooped suddenly down on
Australia, Australia would do the same. The
Boers have many unattractive qualities, and
some bad ones. But they are brave men fight-
ing for home and country, and their courage
and their patriotism are worthy of all honor.
The Same Rag Again.
Melbourne Beacon, the Foreign-trade and
Single-tax organ, still raves about its alleged
fact that the people of New South Wales are
much better fed than those of Victoria owing to
the blessings of Foreign-trade in the former
province. This paper showed from Coghlan’s
Statistics (page 300, volume I. for 1894) that the
statement in question was a hollow invention,
and the Beacon now returns to the charge and
says The Bulletin’s figures are not there.
Picking out one or two items it says :
Coghlan, on whose statistics The Bulletin scribe pro-
fesses to rely, gives it (the wheat consumption) at 3001bs.
and 3901b5. respectively. . . . Similarly Coghlan gives
the consumption of sugar for 1892 at 93’51bs. for New
South Wales and 90‘7511)3. for Victoria, thus again stamp-
ing as a pure invention the statement alleged to be made
on his authority that “the balance on the sugar item is in
favor of Victoria.”
Now, on the page to which this paper referred
the Beacon’s garbled statistician, and which he
refuses to look at, the wheat consumption is
given as 3601 b. for N.S. W. and 3381 b. for
Victoria, which is a great difference, and the
sugar consumption is returned at 94Jib. per
inhabitant per annum in Victoria against
91 Jib. in N.S. W., which is a distinct balance
in favor of Vic., though the Beacon says it
isn’t. If the Beacon professes to deny the
existence of these figures it makes no differ-
ence ; any one can find them on page 300
of Coghlan’s 1894 Statistics, and to deny the
existence of figures that are open to everybody
is mere drivel. The same table shows, to any-
one who cares to add it up, that the general
assertion about the Cornstalk being better fed
is merely an attempt to play upon the assumed
ignorance of the public. The old table for 1892,
to which the Beacon now refers, if added up,
shows the same thing. All the same, this
fiaper lends its tribute of admiration to the sub-
ime audacity of the Melbourne Foreign-trade
rag. A paper which can flatly refuse to admit
the existence of figures that are open to the
inspection of everybody who is within reach of
the local Public Library, and can denounce the
statement that they do exist as “pure inven-
tion,” and which represents N.S. W. as being a
Freetrade province in ’92 when everybody
knows it was nothing of the kind, has a great
future before it.
A Tory’s Dilemma.
Melb. Argus is fairly “stuck” for a policy.
It would like to be Freetrade, but absolutely
dare not face the abolition of Customs revenue,
and the consequent necessity for direct taxa-
tion. It would like to be Protectionist and
champion the cause of Protected Fat Men, but
to do this it would have to throw over the Free-
trade Fat Men of Flinders-lane. In its dilemma
it flounders from one extreme to another. For
instance, one Bedggood, a boot-manufacturer,
made a complaint against Factories’ Bills—the
Argus at once slavers Bedggood as a heavenly
person. Two days afterwards it says factories
legislation is necessary and Bedggood’s class
are sweaters :
Argus, Feb. 3, 1896.
Praise of Protected Manu-
facturers.
Manufacturers who spend
capital in erecting and
equipping factories become
suspected persons when
they seek to obtain men and
women to work for them.
Tlie harassing espionage to
which they are subjected
might be borne by long-suf-
fering persons (oonscious of
their own desire to do wrong
to no one), but when the
Chief - Secretary wants to
regulate their businesses in
vital particulars the time
comes for protest. Patience
and meek submission then
cease, to be virtues. On
Friday last Messrs. Bkdg-
good and Co. told in our
columns how they were
actually prevented from
carrying on their work by a
Minister of the Crown. . . .
What can the Chief-Secre-
tary possibly know of the
secret intentions or policy of
a trading firm ? They are
the best judges of what is
required in their own busi-
ness, and a Minister who
interferes runs the risk of
looking like a fool.
Argus, Feb. 5,1896.
Attack on Protection.
Factories legislation of
some kind has been admit-
tedly rendered necessary by
the utter and deplorable
failure of the High Tariff to
give the promised abundant
work and good wages in the
trades. The rule has
worked out that the heavier
the duty the greater the
sweating,
As a further complication in its tangled policy,
the Argus adds the 25 per cent, reformed
tariff. It occasionally tells the Freetraders
that this is only a halfway-house to Freetrade,
but it also tells Protectionists that it is the ideal
Protection, because it allows competitive goods
to come in and produce revenue. The Argus
faces North by South, and blushingly confesses
to being an ardent Protectionist, who believes
that a Factories’ Act is required to prevent
sweaters from being interfered with. The
Argus cannot see that the establish-
ment of Protection is something more than
barring the foreigner from our markets : it is
a measure that is incomplete till it provides a
fair wage for work done under fair condi-
tions. Protection implies a bargain with the
manufacturer for equitable conditions of work
and wages —if the bargain be broken by one
party to it, the other has a reasonable grievance.
The Vic. Sweating Board’s report proved con-
clusively enough that inequitable trade-condi-
tions existed in the Protected tailoring and
boot-making trades—though not as badly as in
the non-Protected baking and underclothing
trades. The Assembly passed a Bill designed
to meet all these cases, and the first person
to squeal is the Protected person Bedggood,
with the effect of seriously upsetting the Argus
policy for the current week.
Party Government.
The Tory papers in Victoria and Maoriland
are just now busy abusing their respective
Ministries because each one is accused of being
what the other is not. Premier Seddon runs
his Government, as far as possible, on strict
party lines. These lines are, briefly, that if a
man belongs to the Ministerial party he must
always vote with the Ministry whether it is
right or wrong, and if he belongs to the Opposi-
tion he must always vote against the Ministry
whether it is right or wrong. Any private
member caught thinking for himself is a traitor
and a turncoat. When the Government in-
troduces a Bill it is its duty to insist
on its party voting for it blindly and
consistently, else the Government will resign
and hand over the job to the Opposition,
which will be quite as unmanageable and quite
as autocratic. The private member doesn’t
legislate, has no control over the State finances,
has no opinions except the opinion that he
should say ditto to his leader, and when he
gives up saying ditto to him he simply goes
over and says the same blind, sheep-like ditto
to another man. He isn’t allowed to amend any-
thing, or reject the bad features of a measure and
retain the good ones, or throw out the fool of
the Ministry and keep the other men ;he isn’t
a man—only a ditto. This is Party Govern-
ment in its full state of development, and
Seddon runs his Ministry to a great extent on
party lines. Therefore he is unanimously
denounced by his Tory opponents as an autocrat
leading a “ servile majority,” a tyrant, and a
man who is destroying the principle of Parlia-
mentary Government. Premier Turner., of
Victoria, on the other hand, has practically
abolished the party system. He makes no
demands on the blind allegiance of his fol-
lowers ; he holds that every member has been
sent into the House to express his independent
opinion and act on it ; and he allows his own
party, as well as everybody else, a free hand
to criticise the Government measures and
amend them if they can, and he hardly ever
attempts to oppose an amendment with the
crude argument that he will resign if it is
carried. As long as his party follows him on
general principles he is content ; his measures
are mostly discussed on their merits, not passed
under compulsion with the threat that other-
wise the House will be subjected to the horrors
of a MTntyre Government; and the Minis-
terial majority is made up, as often as not,
with votes from the Opposition corner, or even
with a few from the direct Opposition. There-
fore, Turner, because he doesn’t perpetually
bang down the statement that he will resign if
his party doesn’t support him whether right
or wrong, is described by the Vic. Tory press
as a weak-kneed individual, who is also
destroying the principle of Parliamentary
Government. The party system is really a
howling tyranny, and no politician nowadays
dare carry it out in its entirety, else he would
be overturned in a month. But, still, he is
supposed to carry it out, therefore he is cursed
if he does attempt to enforce it and cursed by
the same people if he doesn’t. And by good
fortune these twin curses are gradually killing
the useless, antiquated system. A thing which
can’t be done and yet can’t be left alone is an
anachronism.
Another Ass Programme.
The S.A. National Ass. has announced its pro-
gramme for the coming elections, and the S.A.
voter is hereby requested to consider it in its
beautiful entirety and see what the Ass has to
offer him :
1. Taxation.—(a) Against the single tax. (6) Against
the progressive and absentee taxes, (c) Against any in-
crease in the land tax.
2. Federation. —In favor of intercolonial Freetrade and
Australian federation.
3. Electoral Law.—(a) Against any reduction in the free-
hold qualification of the electors in the Legislative Coun-
cil. (6) In favor of extending the leasehold qualification
to Crown lessees owning improvements of the value of
£2OO. (c) In favor of the occupying qualification being
extended to joint occupiers whose respective qualification
is over £25 each.
4. Land Settlement. —( a ) In favor of liberal land legis-
lation to promote pastoral or agricultural occupation. (6)
In favor of the sale of Crown lands.
5. Northern Territory.—ln favor of developing the
Northern Territory by permitting the introduction of
suitable labor for sub-tropical cultivation. Encouraging
pastoral settlement and the mining industry, or, in the
alternative, requesting the Home Government to relieve
the colony of its responsibility.
6. Government Economy.—( a ) In favor of reduction in
Government expenditure. (6) Abolition of payment of
members of the Legislative Council, (c) Reduction of
the education vote by the discontinuance of indiscriminate
free education, (d) Reduction in the cost of railway ser-
vice, having due regard to efficiency.
7. State Interference. — (a) Against unnecessary State
interference with production and industry. (6) Against
State interference with the Savings Bank.
8. Open Questions. —Temperance legislation, effective
voting, religious instruction in State schools.
The Ass is definite on some points and lament-
ably indefinite on others. With regard to the
definite ones, it wants to abolish the absentee
tax and the special tax on big landlords, there-
fore the people who live in the province and
the working-classes and the small farmers will
have to pay more to make up the shortage thus
created. It wants to keep the Legislative
Council as close a corporation as possible, and
by abolishing payment of members to ensure
that only ricli men shall be able to sit there—in
other words, it wants to make the Upper House
a strict Tory organisation which will squash the
progressive measures of the People’s Chamber.
Further, it wants to introduce cheap nigger-
labor and Chinamen and leprosy into the
Northern Territory, whence they will slop over
into South Australia proper, as well as into the
adjacent provinces, and gradually oust the
white agriculturist and the white artisan. As
an alternative to this, it desires to make the
Territory a Crown colony, or a colony run by a
British syndicate, which would make the
Federation of all Australia wholly impossible,
and would probably introduce into this continent
a little irresponsible filibustering power of the
African Chartered Co. variety, which might
have one day to be resisted by the other pro-
vinces with armed force. Likewise, it proposes
to abolish free education, and cultivate national
ignorance, and re-establish and consolidate the
fine old banking monopoly and the system of
10 per shent mortgages. It doesn’t promise
to assist the Bible-in-schools party, so there is
no reason why the religious crowd should
rally round it. Also, there is no reason why
the teetotal crowd should rally round it, as it
distinctly refuses to commit itself on the grog
question. And its promises of economy don’t
amount to much, partly because every party
promises economy, so in this respect it offers
nothing that the province hasn’t got already ;
and chiefly because it doesn’t state a single
specific instance in which it is going to econo-
mise, except by saving a miserable ,£4BOO a
year off payment of members and economising
on the spread of knowledge, against which it
proposes to sacrifice a great deal in land
and income tax. Moreover, it doesn’t even
definitely promise to reduce expenditure, it is
merely “in favor of” a reduction, and it is
presumably also in favor of the millennium,
which is quite as definite and quite as much to
the point. It is also “ in favor of ” Federation
and intercolonial Freetrade, but as the Demo-
cratic party and the present Democratic
Government are on that side too, the Ass here
also offers nothing that South Australia doesn’t
already possess. Moreover, as it proposes, by
its Northern Territory policy, to make Federa-
tion practically impossible, this item might just
as well have been left out.
The Bitter Cry of the British Manu-
facturer.
The following pamphlet (written by Bryant
and May) is now interleaved in several English
magazines that come to the Protection-cursed
and Protection-blighted Australia
THE QUESTION OF THE HOUR.
It there be one question of greater importance than any
other, it is
How are Working People to be kept Employed?
Down at Bow, in the East-End of London, is the largest
match-factory in the world, where constant employment
is found for nearly two thousand workers, mostly of the
female sex.
Notwithstanding the best efforts of an energetic staff
to encourage the demand, large numbers of applicants
for work are turned away every day, solely through the
increase of foreign competition.
More than £400,000 worth of foreign matches have been
purchased by inconsiderate consumers in this country
during the last twelve months.
When shall we wake up to the importance of Supporting
Home Industries in matches?
assert that if all consumers in Great Britain and
Ireland would use only their matches, they would be able
to pay one thousandpounds weekly in wages to additional
workers in the East-End of London.
This is the outcry of one of the worst-paid
and most unwholesome of all London’s bad
trades. The firm cries from the deeps of low
wages and low standard of living. A
touch of absurdity lightens the tragedy in
the wretched manufacturers’ howl : “Why
should we not support Home Industries in
matches ?” Just as Reid is Freetrade in every-
thing but sand-shifting and sugar, so these
fellows dare not be heterodox in anything but
matches. But it is significant that in the
country and century of Cobden and Bright
this miserable trade should report the triumph
of foreign competition and the discomfiture of
miserable cro\vds which hang round English
match-factories for the sweater’s dole without
getting it.
The recently-published annual report of N. S. W.
police department upsets several teetotal asser-
tions. In ’95 there were four pubs, less in
Sydney than in ’94, yet there were over 300 more
convictions for drunkenness. This tends to
disprove the case for Local Option, which rests
on the assumption that drinking is in pro-
portion to the number of publicans, or, to use
the pump phrase, “ the consumption of alcohol
varies according to the facilities for obtaining
it.” The hope that, in consequence of depres-
sion and want of employment, drunkenness
would diminish, has proved unfounded, adds
the report. This bears out the anti-teetotal
contention that poverty, instead of being the
result, is oftener the cause of drunkenness.
Lastly, despite increased drunkenness, there
has beeu a diminution in serious crime. The
serious criminal, like the wide-awake gambler,
is generally a water-drinker.
Dear Bulletin, — Be those two similar episodes
in the careers of Mr. Blake, Q.C., and the late
Mr. Aspinall, Q.C., let us charitably suppose
that the miserable little cabal which refused the
use of Melbourne Town Hall to the masterful
Edward Blake did so in ignorance of the man
and his career. Blake was for many years
Canada’s most powei ful political orator. The
rumor, “ Blake is going to speak,” was suffi-
cient to fill every seat in Ottawa House of
Commons. There are no useless frills, there is
no Irishism, on Blake’s rhetoric. Clear, calm,
logical, convincing, he holds his audience from
start to finish. During his Canadian political
eareer he was the one man really feared
by that wily Tory leader, Macdonald.
When the notorious Pacific Railway scan-
dal was unearthed, and Macdonald was
convicted of having drawn on Hugh Allan,
the Montreal steamship man, for large sums
with which to bribe the constituencies, Allan
to be afterwards repaid with the Pacific Rail-
way contracts, it was Edward Blake, with his
powerful denunciations of the corruption of the
Government, and his fervid appeals to the
honor and patriotism of the people, who was
mainly instrumental in thrusting Macdonald
from power. After that chieftain’s overwhelm-
ing defeat, when Blake might have had any
post he chose, from Premier down, he was with
difficulty induced to accept a seat in the Cabinet
without portfolio. Premier, Chief Justice, High
Commissioner for Canadain England—allof these
have been in his grasp, and at his disposal.
The knowledge of this fact has sufficed him.
He has never sought office. He has bestowed
it on others, and probably derived more gratifi-
cation from making premiers and judges and
ambassadors. As for the clap-trap titles that
all the butchers and bakers and candlestick-
makers of Australia are grasping after, a know-
ledge of the number of times that Blake has
brushed contemptuously aside offers of these
“ honors,” so coveted by them, would turn the
whole mongrel pack green with envy. Blake
has never been “ for sale ” either for position or
title, and if for no other reason, he was most
cordially hated by the Tory clique in Canada.
The mouth of Edward Blake, scholar, jurist,
statesman, orator, patriot, padlocked by a
parcel of fat and greasy citizens of Gonebung-
borne !— Kanuck.
Adelaide runs its sanitary department on
much the same basis as Sydney. The accumu-
lated rubbish of the city is mostly taken out to
a piece of waste ground behind the cemetery
and conveniently adjacent to the city, and
there piled up in a mound 150 ft. long and as high
as the man with the shovel can make it. It
has; been gathered there for many years.
When the mound gets too large and offensive
some of it is carted away, no one knows exactly
where, and the process of accumulation starts
again. An unclean hermit has scooped out a
cave for hitnself in the oldest and soundest part
of the awful pile, and lives there gathering
infection in his long hair and his matted beard.
Sydney cultivates a similar mountain of horrors
at Moore Park, and the accumulated rags and
dead cats and meat bones of the city are
shot down there in the hope of a blessed resur-
rection by-and-bye. A few weird outcasts, like
the Eaters-of-Unelean-Things thatdwelt outside
ancient Carthage, live and sleep and dine among
this dreadful accumulation of offal, and gather
infected rags from the heaps to sell to bedding-
factories. Also, pigs root and burrow among
them, and no one knows for certain that the
lank and leprous hog which provides his morn-
ing bacon hasn’t mooned its life away in this
lamentable spot and gnawed the ordinary dead
dog of commerce. Likewise, cows haunt the
same locality and stir up the tuberculous rags
of the dead consumptive and the clothes of the
deceased cancer patient, and bring away
samples of them in the milk. And neither
Adelaide nor Sydney seems to have any definite
idea of abandoning this dirty, primitive system,
and destroying its refuse by fire—the only
reasonable guarantee against the spread of in-
fection. Both cities are only in the second
stage of development. The first stage is that
in which man lets everything drop on the floor.
The second is that in which he throws it out of
the front door to a variable distance and leaves
it there, and after a century of progress a
great part of Australia still throws it out and
leaves it there.
S.M. Herald heavily censures N.S.W. Labor-
party for appealing to the State for “ class
advantages.” “ Already your class is educated
by the State,” it reprovingly observes. What
about the State-paid train which carries the
Morning Herald gratis every day over the
country ? What about the University, largely
supported by the State, and whose hours of
instruction are so distributed that the Herald
class obtain most of its advantages ? What
about High Schools and various other subsi-
dised establishments which, again, the Herald
class take first and longest pull at ? And what
about Government House ? Governor after
Governor has stated that all he gets from the
State he spends in entertaining a class among
whose swallow-tails and inane faces Herald
people are regularly found. “ Class ” advan-
tages, indeed !
“ K.” writes from Tasmania :
Dear Buri/btin, —The writer of “ An Alleged Plan down
South ” evidently has little knowledge of C. H. Grant, of
Tasmania. He says : “They (Vic. Ministers) went to the
most melancholy of Australian railway systems and took
a man front it who, as ministerial head, knew least about
it.” Now, as a fact, Grant has never been connected
with the Tasmanian railwa3' system, the one referred to.
Grant came to Tasmania 20 odd years ago to manage the
Hobart and Launceston railway (known as the “ main
line”) for the English Tasmanian Main Line Railway
Company. From its opening in 1876 until its pur-
chase by Tas. Govt, in ’9O, Grant managed it with
success. For some months previous to its purchase
by Govt., the latter had been engaged in litigation
with the co., during the conduct of which it became
more and more apparent to the Tas. taxpayer that
Grant, a man of many parts, shrewd and business-like,
was, in almost every respect, superior to the successive
Ministerial and Crown Law officers of the province. The
Government lost a hopeless case, and Grant emerged
from the witness-box with his reputation for skill in his
profession and for general outside practical knowledge
enhanced above any other in the island. Then the
Attorney-General sailed for England to conduct an appeal
to the Privy Council; but, meanwhile, the awful
superiority of Grant filled the minds of the rest of the
Cabinet with a fear that he would proceed to score several
more points upon them in unexpected quarters, and a
hurried bargain eventuated in the Government purchasing
the line from Oct. 1, ’9O, at a very profitable figure for the
co. Grant began his Parliamentary career in June, ’92,
when he was elected one of the M.’sL.C. for Hobart. Two
months after his election he became Minister without
portfolio in the Dobson Ministry, and since its downfall in
April, ’94, he has been a private member. The writer of
the article, tabulates the average railway losses of the
various Australasian provinces for ’92-3, showing Tas-
mania’s as the highest, and after pointing out the high
ratesof Tas. railway fares andfreights continues: “Theonly
knowledge that Grant could claim was, therefore, the
knowledge of a bad system for the badness of which he
was in a remote degree responsible.” During the years
’92-3, Grant had no connection with railways in Tasmania
other than that of Minister without portfolio. And that
is the nearest connection that has ever existed between
him and the Tasmanian railway system. On the purchase
of the Main Line by Govt, it fell into the “ system ” under
the management of the Government General Manager of
Railways (Mr. F. Back). It is still worked without loss,
as is also the Western line. It is such white elephants as
the Oatlands, the Derwent Valley, the Chudleigh, the
Sorrell, and the Apsley railways, that more than eat the
profits of other lines. Those are the bad parts of the
system, and it is precisely with them that Grant was
never connected, and for the badness of which he cannot
be even in “ a remote degree responsible.”
Hear Bulletin, — Re rifle-companies as a
means of producing sharpshooters, I doubt the
experiment proving a success, as wherever such
companies are formed, the local solicitor,
bank - clerk or civil - servant will officah
the corps, and social distinctions will keep out
the very men likely to become expert with the
rifle. I refer to the bush-workers. The high
prices at one time obtainable for marsupial
scalps and skins turned thousands,of our bush-
men’s attention to the use of modern firearms,
and the skill then acquired under the most
favorable circumstances for bringing out guerilla
riflemen is still with the men who wander
throughout the interior; for, although the prices
now paid make the trade none too profitable,
it is still followed up in the slack season
after shearing and harvest. Moreover, up-to-
date rifles are to be found in almost every bush
hut now, where, 12 years ago, one might occa-
sionally only see an obsolete muzzle-loader, so
that the younger generation are familiarised
with good weapons as soon as they are strong
enough to hold them straight. In the boom-
times I travelled over most of N.S. Wales for a
skin-buying firm, and visited hundreds of
camps, and often witnessed magnificent shoot-

generally, such as one reads so much of at
the annual military shoot, as, whether the
shooters were located in the misty valley,
on the windy heights of New England, or the
glaring North-western plains, the writer saw
enough to convince him that in these men,
hardy, keen of sight, and used to shooting suc-
cessfully under all sorts of conditions, we have
riflemen equal to Boer or American backwoods-
men, and, like them, pursuing a policy of non-
interference until the aggressor comes fooling
round their gates.— Scalp.
A glance at the just-to-hand M.L. statutes for
’95 session shows that the local democrat is up
and doing. Most noticeable, and probably
most far-reaching in its consequences, is the
Adoption of Children Act drafted on the lines of
Roman law. Besides its ordinary use, it will
probably be widely resorted to as a means of
removing the effects of illegitimacy from chil-
dren. The act is a deliberate slap in the face
of English common law, which has always
fiositively refused to recognise adoption (per-
rnps for good reasons, who can say ?). The
Family Homes Act does for the poor what the
marriage and other settlements already do for
the rich—saves the Home from the mortgagee
and assignee, on an equitable basis. The
Wages Attachment Act keeps small wages from
the garnishee. The Servants Registry Offices
Act should prove a useful leech-killer and might
well be adopted in Australia. The Corrupt
Practices Amendment tries to limit Parlia-
mentary election expenses to £2OO. The
Evidence Amendment contains novel clauses
defining “proper” and “ improper” questions
with reference to the bullying cross-examiner.
It also protects confessions to “ ministers ” and
medical men, but rather injudiciously extends
the admissibility of confessions extracted by
detectives, &c. The Property Law Consolida-
tion Act contains a most useful provision allow-
ing payment of mortgage money to the Treasurer
when the lender is out of the country. The
Reprint of Statutes Act is a preliminary to an
extensive consolidation. But it contains
references,to “obsolete” statutes. Are there
any such ? If so, should there be ? How draw
the line between “ blue ” laws and laws not
blue ? Adulteration, shop assistants, and cre-
mation are also legislated on. Altogether, the
most interesting and progressive set of Aus-
tralasian statutes of the year.
Sir Tit-bits Newnes lately bought London
Weekly Dispatch with a view to converting it
into a “ good ” Sunday paper. English Sabbath
journalism up to now has always been more or
less radical— i.e., evil —in its tone. Newnes, the
glorified pirate, will endeavor to furnish an anti-
dote to the jioison, and earn a peerage.

Hawke’s Bay (M.L.) Herald of
Jan. 14, which doesn’t like The Bulletin
and loses no opportunity of saying nasty
things about it, steals without acknowledg-
ment from this paper five paragraphs,
occupying about half-a-coluinn of space.
The leading article moralises on “ inter-
mediate prisons,” which seem very fitly to
have cast a shadow over the editorial
sanctum.
A Geraldton correspondent tells The
Bulletin that he has just sold a full-sized
billiard-table, &c., to a party of Germans
who are taking it to Lawler’s, 2fco miles
past Cue goldfield. “ I have never heard,”
he says, “of a billiard-table travelling so
far by road. From Mullewa, the end of
the line, to Cue is 220 miles, from Cue to
Lawler’s 260—in all 480 miles by road, and
not a good one for water. The Germans
deserve to make money after such an un-
dertaking.”
Here is Frank Mahony’s idea of
Henry Lawson—the bard of the Man Who
Walks, as “Banjo” is of the Man Who
Rides. The Bulletin doubts if Lawson
was ever on a horse in his life, but he has
“ humped bluey ” over many a sultry
stretch of country “out back.” Mahony
has caught him in the act, and the presenta-
tion is lifelike —though the dog, this paper
fancies, is a bit of romance ; it doesn’t look
like the dog Lawson writes about. “In the
Days When the World Was Wide and other
Verses,” Lawson’s book of poems (to which
Mahony’s sketch is prefixed), is now ready
(ss. 6d. post free from this office), and Aus-
tralians who like reading some of the best
Australian verses ever written can only do
better than buying a copy by buying two.
The scandal of overcrowded passenger-
steamers has at last increased to such a pitch that
the owner-ridden Australian Marine Boards re-
luctantly take notice of it. Two or three captains
have, therefore, been fined about «£2O apiece—
which, distributed among, say, 200 passengers at
£5 per head, amounts to a risk of exactly 2 per
cent, on the gross returns. Auy intelligent cap-
tain, therefore, who has be a in the habit of
carrying 100 passengers more than his certificate
permits, will in future carry 104—and pay his
over loading insurance premium by further over-
loading. This paper considers that the ‘ ‘ fine ” for a
second offence should be one month without the
option. But probably the Marine Boards won’t
look at it like that.
Sydney, February 11, 1896.
My Dear Moor ybinda—
The gushing old maid who hugs a wheezy pug
to her bony bosom had better take notice of a late
suburban excitement. Two stalwart policemen
unearthed a box of bones in the back-yard of a
lady who had moved away somewhere else, and
who was at once suspected of being a disciple of
Mrs. Makin. The bones were reverently carted
to the proper authorities, who held on to them
with a stern expression until the city coroner
arrived, and solemnly handed them over to a
medico. He was getting ready to deliver a long
Latin opinion, Yvhen a breathless neighbor arrived
with the news that, some time ago, the pet-dog of
the occupant of No. 6017963'021 died, and was
buried in the yard. Even then, the bones were
viewed with the cold eye of legal suspicion until
the doctor discovered a tail among the remains.
The moral is that, if you yvill give your pets Xtian
burial, be sure the tail is included.
Apropos of buried animal pets whose skeletons
engender suspicion in the mind of Policeman X.,
it once fell to the late W. B. Dailey’s lot to prose-
cute a woman for infanticide, based on a myste-
rious collection of bones discovered in a front-
garden. The case was going very badly for the
accused, and symptoms of rope were visibly appa-
rent in the countenance of His Honor, when
zoologist Krefft turned up in an excited state with
an explanation, which, not being able to put it into
POET LAWSON ON THE WALLABY.
“ For time means tucker, and tramp you must , where
the plains and scrubs are wide,
With seldom a track that a man can trust, or a moun-
tain peak to guide,
All day long in the flies and heat, the men of the
outside track;
With stinted stomachs and blistered feet, must carry
their sioags Out Back.”
coherent English, he was obliged to express in
pantomime. So he drooped his hands ala mar-
supial’s fore-paws and hopped about the court, to
everybody’s amusement, until the befogged Bench
saw the application of his gymnastics and let the
defendant go.
So that recent suburban case has historic prece-
dent, and will probably happen yet again.
Nobody who has a pet buried on the premises can
feel really certain that she isn’t on the eve of
being arrested for some Makinesque crime. The
only safe way to bury a pet is to have witnesses to
the ceremony, and signed certificates to the effect
that Grimalkin has been well and truly laid under
the apple-tree; people who haven’t taken these
precautions tremble in their tan hoots. I know
I do. I have the mortal remains of Toby, a pet
wallaby, buried under the rose, and Heaven only
knows what may happen if ever his bones are
spaded up—especially if any of his tail-joints are
missing.
Sydney Anglican cathedral, beautifully deco-
rated for the occasion, was crowded to the doors
on 4th inst., when pretty Miss Maud Roberts
became Mrs. Stanley Meylius. The sacrificial
robes were of cream satin, with trimmings of real
lace and a lower-cut bodice than one usually sees
at a wedding ; while a necklace in floral enamel set
with diamonds, and a handsome bridal posy (the
bridegroom’s gift) made becoming etceteras. Her
four maids wore strawberry-pink and green silk
respectively, the two elder bridesmaids, wearing
Gamsboro’ gowns with large Gainsboro’ hats in
black velvet with pink and black feathers, and
carrying floral crooks. The bridegroom, who is
fair-haired, wore a deeper shade of mauve in his
tie than is usual —English fashion, I suppose. The
going-away gown was an artistic combination of
heliotrope figured crepon, with fixings of cherry-
colored silk and ecru lace ; and a hat of toast-
colored straw with crimson flowers completed a
stylish ensemble.
A Maoriland hen-convention (it calls itself a
“ Women’s Social and Political League ” on its
notepaper) came to one sensible conclusion at the
end of a year’s jaw-jaw, when it rose and hurled
its anathema at “ the great injustice caused by
wealthy ladies working articles for bazaars and
sales of work, thus depriving their needy sisters of
a means of livelihood.” To carry the war into the
enemy’s camp, copies of this anathema were sent
to a baker’s dozen of local clergymen, none of
whom had enough sophistry to invent a plausible
excuse—at any rate, no answers have been
received up to date. The Church in Maoriland is
peculiarly easy-going and rapacious. It doesn’t
object to holding a show in aid of its special brand
of soul-cure on the stage of an ungodly playhouse,
for instance. Most parsons restrict the amateur
high-kickist (who shows a great deal more of her
petticoat than the other sort) to the holy platform
of the Sabbath-school.
Apropos new woman—if the Bloomering cycliste
gets over 14th Feb. without wanting to break
somebody on her wheel it won’t be the fault of the
ugly-valentine artists, who have turned out a par-
ticularly strong sample of invective against the
female Ixion. She is called indecent, insane,
ugly, old and ludicrous in more or less blistering
samples of verse, and I pity the husband of the
wheelswoman when the postman weighs in with
the mail on St. Valentine’s Day.
Sydney is to have a French library under the
auspices of the Alliance Franjaise, and the
Consul-General, M. Biard d’Aunet. It is to
be temporarily housed (from Ist prox.) at
the French Consulate, and will be well stocked
with French fiction, classics, history, travel, and
so forth. For five guineas one becomes a per-
petual member; one guinea per annum is the price
of full membership; and there are no extra charges.
And, talking of French, Madame Juliette Henry’s
Cercle hasn’t lost ground during the short holidays
—her first re-union of the new term last Wednes-
day was largely attended and a great success.
New-chums like to rub the saltpetre in occasion-
ally. A Johnny-come-lately was unusually com-
plimentary, even effusive, over the evidences of
money observable in Sydney. But he carried the
usual sting in his tail. “ Ai’m not a bit surprised,
yer know, at the money some of your trades-
lieople make. Ai quite expected to find your
ocksmiths, for example, in quite a flourishing
state, ’pon me honor. ”
From W. H. Paling and Co. comes a piano solo,
“Memories,” by Florrie Clarks, and dedicated to
Lady Clarke. “ Memories ” is a study in common
or garden arpeggios, but without the bedrock of
melody which separates the “ piece ” from the
“exercise.” As good practice in straddling all
over the gamut “ Memories ” has much to recom-
mend it. ‘ ‘ Sowalde ” waltz, by Helen B. Harding,
is a somewhat insipid and purposeless dance-tune,
running to eleven pp., and more or less in five flats ;
and a song, “Forget Me Not,” sung by Ada
Colley, and composed and written by J. R. Gor-
ing Thomas (not A. Goring Thomas, the English
song-composer), depends for its success on the
amount of passion in the voice of the singer.
“ Forget Me Not ” is rather see-saw, I regret to
say. Why doesn’t a genius come along so that I
may gratify my inherent longing to distribute
nothing but marmalade? I don’t want to find
fault with people’s music—-I want to be kissing
my hand at genius once a week.
Apropos of music, the Triad is a Maoriland
journal which dedicates its little self principally to
the worship of Euterpe, and issues a high-class
musical supplement with each number. In the
two which reach me are included a Mazourka of
Chopin ; Sarabande (Corelli), and a duet from the
Fairy Music of Mendelssohn, besides one or two
classic songs. The Triad evidently has music in
its soul, and I hope it will meet with every
success.
Weigel’s Journal oe Fashion for February
naturally hasn’t much news to impart, for Autumn
isn’t within cooee yet, and summer fashions are a
novelty with the edge off and a coating of dust on
the hem, so to speak. The journal announces in a
depressed kind of way that basques will be smart
for winter—but the greatest horror in the book is
that cardboard fancy-work is coming in again.
Of all the useless tricks in the realm of fancy-
work, cardboard-teasing is the worst. A night-
mare of my infancy is a cardboard “ travelling
purse supposed to be a fitting receptacle for one’s
cash en route. It had cardboard sides feebly
designed with a struck-by-lightning sort of flower
apiece and joined with pink silk veiled in tulle—a
silk card provided the handle—making a most
useful article to put firmly away in a drawer. I
thought the feminine world had got beyond show-
ing such flabby and useless results of so much time,
but it seems that the era of glorified band-boxes is
on us again. How I pity all engaged young men,
who may now expect cardboard-braces and smok-
ing-caps !
Talking of engaged young men, it may interest
a certain tuneful and attractive comic opera singer
now appearing with much “ eclaw ” in Australia,
to learn that the Australian novelist, Guy
Booth by, is now a Benedict with a rich wife.
One time the warbleress above-mentioned was
engaged to Mr. 8., to whom she gave the merci-
less mitten —but that was before his books began
to sell. And I see that Gilbert Parker, the man
who dramatised “Faust ’’and gave the devil all
the limelight, and didn’t write that memorable
S.M. Herald introduction to a Melb. Cup report,
is newly-married to a gilded Yankee girl. All
literary America was at the wedding.
The Sydney Town Hall meeting of old volun
teers brought to a head by ex-Premier Dibbs, tc
which flocks of back-number warriors came dis
playing their medals, reminded me of the crone’s
chorus in “Dorothy,” altered to “ Sogering isn’t
what it used to be.” . . . . “Better than
that we can fight you’ll see.” And on top
of all comes a cold douche of criticism from
“a high military authority.” “ The value of the
proposed volunteer reserve would be practically
nil from a military point of view.” And then the
H.M.A. goes on to blightingly remark in print
that if the late Premier had always been of so
belligerent a humor he mightn’t have found it
necessary to enrol himself and his rusty gun.
Evidently the rough passage the military esti-
mates had through Parliament is neither forgiven
nor forgotten. At the same time, High Military
Authorities are to be received with caution. The
H.M.A. kind of man used to laugh at the Boer
militia, for instance, because its goose-step wasn’t
perfect.
The officers of the naval and military forces
purpose entertaining Major-General and Mrs.
Edward Hutton at a valedictory conversazione
at Sydney Town Hall, on Tuesday, 25th inst.,
with Gov. and Lady Hampden at the prow. A
brilliantspectacle isa foregone conclusion whenever
the picturesque military and naval element organ-
ises a function.
Not a playgoer all over Australia but will feel
an intense desire to dress in sackcloth and ashes
on hearing that the Brough and Boucicault partner
ship dissolves at the fag-end of June next, when,
in all probability, the gifted “ Dot ” hies him tc
Lunnon, which is about the right-sized village foi
an actor of his ability. I have only one fault tc
find with Dion, junr. ; occasionally he pronounces
“Mrs.” as “Mishes” —as if he had a cold in his
head.
I hope that the dissolution of partnership won’t
deprive us of the solace of the B. company. 1
write in a solemn spirit with a crape-wreathed
pen on this most serious subject. The B. and B.
co.—in spite of a dogged preference for one lead-
ing lady, whether the part to be interpreted fits
her like a glove or a No. 10 Wellington boot—is a
charming aggregate, with plays always up to date,
and smartly-dressed into the bargain. Mrs.
Brough, by the way, patronises the same Sydney
frockist whom Maud Hobson overwhelmed with
her hunger for gew-gaws. But when you come to
realise that, if Mrs. B. doesn’t hold the co.
together, we have only W. and M. left between us
and the deep sea of over-painted melodrama,
where the villain evidently goes to bed in full
evening-dress, and individual attention is given to
the groans of the wounded—then you feel that, if
Boucicault is permitted to escape to the Big
Smoke, somebody ought to hobble Brough as a
guarantee of good faith.
The “ wibble-wobble ” is becoming the curse of
our vocalists. Introduced by a lot of ill-taught
singers, under the title of tremolo or vibrato,
it has insidiously destroyed more good voices
than enough. Santley detests it, and says,
“Whenever I hear a singer introducing the
tremolo, I know that voice is on the sure road to
ruin—nothing can save it.” The disease is parti-
cularly bad in Sydney, and is daily getting
worse. In nine cases out of ten it is nothing
but a senseless affectation, which soon becomes an
unconquerable habit, utterly destructive of purity
of tone and voice. How is the awkward fact tc
be got over that Patti, Melba, Yere Sapio,
Antoinette Trebelli, and dozens of the musical
planets hate and abhor it, and seldom, if ever, ust
it, unless to illustrate certain degrees of expres-
sion ? But Sydney vocalists know better than the
greatest of the great of the musical firmament.
The wibble-wobble is practised—and performed—
by sopranos, contraltos, tenors, and basses—they’re
all in it! J
Hobart young men, I am told, are much enraged
over some recent local dances, to which none of
them were bidden ; maledom being represented
by officers off the warships now in port. When
dancing commenced there were hardly any officers
present, and the ladies had to sit and look on —
some even went home again. The lady of the
house went round and apologised for the non-
appearance of the men. And now a number of
the Hobart youths declare they will refuse the
next invitation they get.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

That dear old friend, the man who called
about a hat, is in evidence this week at Sydney
Criterion. It is years since Bosco Blithers
last called about a nat in Sydney—except when
some casual amateur co. has grievously mauled
Craven’s fine comedy—and “ Mixed ” has become
new again to a great number of modern play-
goers. It also bears the reputation of being a
lucky comedy, and deservedly so ; more than one
season that was fast going to decay has been
restored to prosperity by the arrival of the
astonishing Blithers in search of his hat. Mr.
Wilson has staged the piece remarkably well;
the Cri. is just large enough to hold it, and
not so large that the maundering of the professor
of elocution gets lost among the vasty recesses
of the roof ; and the co. is evidently getting accus-
tomed to play together and works remarkably
well. Ralph Roberts’s Blithers is very nearly as
good as that of the lamented Phil. Day, and his
metallic voice suits the character. Shine, as the
parent who dined out with a midnight female and
afterwards struck a stranger with his eye, is a
good elderly prodigal, and a wild Irish person
with red hair excites a good deal of approval.
Some of the ladies whom The Bulletin com-
plained of earlier in the season have retired, over-
whelmed with this paper’s just disapprobation,
and the new ones are a decided improvement.
Altogether, Blithers should keep on calling about
his hat to good business for the next three weeks
at least.

“To the West,” the perfectly new melo-
drama which was staged last Saturday at Her
Majesty’s, is not a production which the public is
expected to take seriously. It is a wildly incon-
sequent affair which perpetually breaks out where
it is least expected, and it goes with a furious
whiz from beginning to end, like an escaped
elephant rushing a dynamite factory, with
Coherence running for its life in front and the
mangled remains of Probability trailing behind.
Nobody with any semblance of a sense of humor
could help enjoying it right through its five acts.
It is one long, painted razzle-dazzle, with joy—-
not always the kind of joy that was intended,
perhaps—in every line. It is utterly irrespective
of time and space, and climbs over everything that
comes in its road, except those things that it goes
straight through. It shows Dampier in evening
dress on board an ocean liner; Dampier in gaol
doing 14 years ; Dampier delirious in the desert
finding gold in the vicinity of Coolgardie; Dampier,
later on, as a miner in a caved-in shaft; Dampier
as a sundowner with a mosquito-net round his hat
and a vacant expression in his eye ; and Dampier
as many other things. A big audience welcomes
him with enthusiasm as all these things, and is
especially enthusiastic when Dampier, with a
<£soo reward on his head, holds forth at con-
siderable length, and with an expression of mild
drivel on his open countenance, re the subject of
sheep to the villain who is out looking for him.
There is a lot of genuine comedy in Dampier’s
essay on sheep, and when he isn’t holding forth
on sheep he makes the impossible hero look as
possible as circumstances will admit, which is
saying a good deal. Still that hero might look a
lot better, but on the opening night everything
went awry, curtains came down sideways or else
refused to come down, and the things that didn’t
come down sideways mostly hung fire and wouldn’t
explode.
* * * »
A lot of other people ramp round along
with Dampier in the sandy-blighted land of West-
ralia. Alfred Woods does another excellent
aboriginal. Rolfe, Johnson Weir and Hodson fill
sundry miscellaneous characters creditably, and in
place of the usual funny man, this prodigal drama
turns on three —Tolano, Watson, and the always-
gratifying Leston, besides others who drop into
comedy incidentally. Also, the beautiful Mrs.
Harry Marshall makes her first appearance at Her
Majesty’s, and in addition to playing her part
admirably in a cheerful, butterfly fashion, she
throws in a musical voice which is always audible,
even above the riot and moral combustion. On
Saturday night the shilling place fell in
love with Mrs. Marshall on the spot, and the
eighteenpenny place-held itself back with diffi-
culty. The rest of the co. is mostly swept jtway
in the excited rush of the drama, which is a large
and improbable shriek about everything, with an
explosion in it, and a dreadful tragedy on a cliff,
and a ship, and a row in a gaol, and deserts,
horses, salt lakes, condensers, sheep, and a general
tearing-up of the uni verse by the roots. And when
one gives up trying to find out why everything
happened, which he naturally does, as nothing
seems to be the cause of anything, it is a very
interesting production which everybody should
see, with a wet towel round his head as a pre-
caution against delirium and sunstroke.

“Mrs. Ebbsmith” and the 8.-B. Co.’s
season at Sydney Lyceum end together this week.
The co. will re-appear in Sydney some time in
April and will run a season at the Criterion until
June. Then this valued firm dissolves, Boucicault
going to England in search of a wider field for his
talents, while Mr. and Mrs. Brough run a re-
organised co. on their own. Australia will drop a
tear as large as a grand piano over this regretable
severance. Brough and Boucicault have run for
many years the best co. in these parts, and one of
the best to be found in these or any other parts, and
though it will probably still be the best co. in
Australia under the senior partner’s sole manage-
ment, still half the,firm isn’t the whole of it, and
Boucicault’s place will be very hard indeed to fill.
Moreover, if the firm gets into the habit of going
away to England the disease may spread and the
whole concern may go away bodily some day, and
when that happens this country will no longer be
worth living in. Therefore, The Bulletin proposes
organising a society for the forcible detention of
Boucicault, and taking up subscriptions with that
laudable end in view. The society will guarantee
Dion G. a pension of .£1000 a year over and above
his earnings so long as he continues playing in
this country and sticks to comedy, and an 8-ton
granite monument, and a tremendous funeral, and
a most beautiful obituary when he dies. And if
he insists on going, despite this offer, the society’s
masked emissary will have orders to slaughter him
in a dark place oh the night of his farewell, so
that if Australia can’t have its Boucicault no one
else shall. The committee which organises the
farewell benefit wjll secretly make a chalk-mark
over the beneficiary’s vital spot, while it embraces
him on the stage,.so that the emissary, who will
plug him as he goes out, ,ean make no mistake as
to the place to aim at. Australia has lost so many
things of late, including four big banks and J. B.
Patterson and Carbine and its faith in the efficacy
of prayers for raili, that it won’t part with its best
comedian without a struggle.

The ever-welcome Comic Opera Co. com-
mences a six weeks’ season at Sydney Lyceum on
Monday with the “ Yeomen of the Guard ; ” the
“ Gondoliers ” and “ Ma Mie Rosette ” to follow.
Also, the Firm promises “Miss Decima,” which is
altogether new to Sydney, and probably “La
Belle Therese.” The co. is unusually strong this
time, including Courtice Pounds, Wallace Brown-
low, Lauri, Howard Vernon, Bracy, Florence
Young, Juliet Wray, the long-lost Flora Graupner,
Marietta Nash, May Pollard, and a host of others.
The “Work Girl”—the drama with the
partially naked Jew in it —is in its fourth week at
Sydney Royal and still doing well. The manage-
ment now advertises it as “the great ladies’
drama,” which is probably its amusing way of
putting things.
* * * *
Sydney Music Hall has laid on a new
ventriloquist, who can represent the ocean moan-
ing on the sands, or a lost dog in the next street,
or a person in an adjacent suburb pounding on a,
Eubhc-house door and trying to get a drink after
ours, or a fat man jammed under a gate, or
almost anything else down to a fried egg in the
distance, or the sound of the editorial gum-pot in
the far West. The other 14 or 165 artistes are all
keeping well and conducting themselves respect-
ably.
* * *- *-
Alice Leamar re-appeared at the Tivoli on
Saturday, and John Coleman—he of the wildly-
improbable legs—is to show there next Monday,
and, in consequence of these things, Sydney now
takes its vittles a good deal more regularly than it
did last week.
* * * *
Some verses suitable for “Djin-Djin”
were offered to the Firm last week through the
post. The writer suggested that they should be
introduced by Miss Young at the end of the first
act, in which case, as he also suggested, the
management might wipe out the obligation with a
couple of tickets for the show. To this end the
poet wound up with his name and address, taking
care, however, to give the G.P.O. as his address.
Perhaps he was anxious to keep his dwelling-place
a secret lest newspaper interviewers should come
bothering him for his photo. These are the
verses :—
Up to now the devil Djin-Djin hasn’t been assisted
by a page, but presuming that a page were worked
into the libretto, the above ballad set to dreamy
music ought to make a sensation. J. C. William-
son states that literary ability has never been so
marked in Melbourne as now. Every post brings
about half a cwt. of bright ideas in prose and
verse, all for Djin-Djin, and each of them offered
in exchange for two tickets or one private box.
In fact, he has often thought of having an authors’
night at the Princess’s, when the lr use would bo
crowded with people who have forwarded little
things of their own.
* * * *
“The Sixth Commandment,” at Melb.
Alexandra, is about the most lurid and blood-
thirsty outcome of Dan Barry’s management, so
far as The Bulletin can remember. It is rumored
that two or three bishops formed themselves into
a syndicate for writing the modern drama in
question, which probably explains why the plot
revolves on a vicar’s awful villainy. Ordinary
playwrights continue to believe a good deal in
parsons. Sometimes they depict an unhappy
chaplain with a bottle to his lips, or permit an
aged rural dean to refer to his unhallowed early
career, but such cases are rare on the stage, and
when found they are associated with deep peni-
tence. When bishops collaborate in drama-
tic literature, they, being better informed,
have no compunction about placing a mur-
derous apostle in the foreground and leaving him to
work out his own damnation. Augustus Glover is
the soiled sky-pilot of this brisk narrative. A
long-lost will and all unsuspecting child stand
between him and wealth, therefore Rev. Augustus
devotes all the time he can spare from church
business to the task of tracking the coveted papers
and destroying the infant. Frequently the bet-
ting is six to four on Augustus. For instance, ho
flings the prattling babe into a steamship’s
furnace, besides making a prayerful effort to get it
swallowed up by a whale. Either of these mis-
deeds would be crowned with success but for Dan
Barry, who plays the part of evil genius to the
gent in holy orders. Daniel plucks the little
brand from the burning, and hauls it from the
cradle of the deep. Also, he thwarts the shep-
herd in a base endeavor to spoil a prize-fight at
Coolgardie, by administering drugs to the Game
Chicken, and finally the good young man of the
piece comes into his own. Marine disasters, bike-
races, “comic relief,” and scenery of a deserving
nature have been crowded into this epic poem.
The details of the Coolgardie prize-fight are super-
intended by Professor Miller, and a vigorous com-
pany of seasoned Alexandra artists does the best
possible with an entertainment which promises to
fill the Haleck with exceeding joy for some nights
to come.
* * * *
Charles Godfrey, who made his first
Australian appearance at Melb. Opera House
on Saturday, may be written down a tolerably
huge success. The audience received him as a
vocalist and character-sketcher of more than
ordinary ability, which he certainly is, and in
return for this general mark of confidence the
new-arrival gave them three or four good samples
of his quality. The recent cooling down of
that sore-eared monarch, Emperor William,
is unfortunate for Charles Godfrey to some
extent. Just now “Balaclava” is received
on its bare merits as a descriptive song sup-
ported by clever spictacular effects, instead of
being a red-hot iiomtive to jingoism. All the
same, this expensive laborer in the Rickards
vineyard will prove worthy of his hire. Lively
Florence Wilton is filling in some last nights at
the Opera House previous to returning ’Ome, and
the company in a number of unspecified respects
is much the same as usual.
* * * *-
“Djin-Djin” will be reluctantly withdrawn
from the Princess’s on Friday (14th). The Melb.
public feels truly sorry to part with this mascotte
pantomime, so m order to soften the blow of its
leave-taking, the Firm has arranged to adminster
two goes of “Djin-Djin” (afternoon and evening)
on the date aforesaid.
** * *
Saturday brings B. and B. back to the
Princess’s. “ The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith,”
fresh from Sydney, will open the campaign, and
restore Mrs. Brough to the admiring gaze of every-
body lucky enough to find a seat on such a very
particular occasion.

Rev. Haskett Smith, the parson w T ho has
paid dozens of visits to Jerusalem, and been buy-
ing groceries at Nazareth any time these last
twenty years, finished a second lecturing season
in Melbourne last week, and is now exploring the
holy land of Adelaide. The name of R. S. Smythe
no longer adorns the programme, but under Hugo
Fischer’s management the reverend member for
Palestine prospereth none the less. He still finds
proof of Bible inspiration in the fact that many
places mentioned m the Book have been actually
beheld by Haskett Smith, and the faithful don’t
want anything more convincing. Also, he has in
view a personally - conducted tour through the
countries he knows so well and talks of so fluently.
Therefore, all persons desirous of dabbling in the
Dead Sea and getting to the other side of Jordan,
are advised to keep Rev. Haskett Smith in view,
and on no account to set out for Canaan without
him. He is undoubtedly the first authority in
Christendom on all matters connected with holy
cities. He has studied the fleas and crawling
things of each historical district, and knows which
sort of insecticide is most suitable in every case.
My heart and brain with fire rage
For the love of Iris' fair ;
I’ll brave the Devil and his page
For the sake of winning her.
For she is young and beautiful,
Fairer than the brightest star ;
For stie is good and dutiful
To her royal old Pa-pa.
At Poverty Point .
Melbourne playgoers particularly were beginning to
wonder what had become of NinaTulloch, “IT he Magpie,”
of Frank Clark’s old Silk Stockings co., and news comes
of her death in South Africa. Nina was a Tasmaniarv
girl of good family. Her imitations of the magpie’s
morning call were extraordinary in their fidelity, and
made a startling chorus to Nina’s one small song.
Melba is said to have cleared £3OOO a-week during the
American concert tour recently completed. Not bad for
the diva’s first venture “ on her own.” At Christmas she
joined the opera co. in New York.
Miss Marie Elster, whose engagement with the Carl
Rosa Opera Co. terminated after one appearance in the
“ Bohemian Girl,” has not since been heard of, although
much inferior artists are raved over every night in Lon-
don and the provinces.
Clever Lardelli has not made the headway he expected
in London. At a late date, he had not got anyone to take
up his opera, “ Katherine,” and his fugitive work is not
more than sufficient to keep him going. Lowenfeld made
him an offer of some kind, but, evidently, nothing has
come of it.
Decima Moore (who, by the way, is a cousin of Signor
Lardelli) is quite charmed with Australia, writes Tiie
Bulletin’s London correspondent. Her father keeps a
bicycle-shop in Brighton.
Mrs. Hugo Gorlitz (Amy Sherwin) is now located at a
very pretty house at Hampstead, London, where she dis-
penses hospitality to a host of friends. Her Xmas enter-
tainment was most successful and quite German in style,
with a huge tree and no end of presents, great and small,
for her guests.
Australians try in vain to remember Barnato tumbling
with Wilson’s Circus. The reason is that Barnato never
did tumble with Wilson’s, or any other circus.
Frances Saville is claimed as “ the Californian prima-
donna” because she was born in Cal., and two of her
brothers still live there. A ’Frisco paper comments
severely on the impudence of Australia in annexing her
as an “Australian prima-donna” merely because her
parents brought her over here when she was too young to
protest.
George Coppin forgot to mention something in his
jubilee panto, speech at Melb. Royal the other week.
This is also the jubilee of his first “retirement” from the
stage. In 1846 he and his wife, both of them on the
sunny side of 30, took a farewell benefit in Melbourne.
If Ada Crossley and Belle Cole are singing in the same
concert company, which of them has choice of position on
the programme ?
The theatrical profesh. is very mixed in its recollections
of the laws of Moses. Dan Barry announced “ The Sixth
Commandment ” as his next drama for Melb. Alexandra ;
whereupon his friends and acquaintances came to him,
one after another, saying, “ So you’re going to give them
something spicy?” They took it for granted that the
sixth was the “ adultery” commandment.
Miss Gillespie, a niece of Premier Kingston, is regarded
as a coming sensation in Adelaide musical circles. The
lady is said to have declined a probationary engagement
with W. & M. recently, and intends to shortly swell
the Australian circle in London.
Luscombe Searelle, who has retired from South Africa
with a fortune, and has a strong literary bent (he once
published a volume of respectable verse) has two books
on the stocks—one a gossipy volume about South Africa,
the other his own experiences in various parts of the
globe, with anecdotes of people he has met and known.
He was wise in clearing out from South Africa (writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent), as there is every pros-
pect of the theatrical business being overdone. Gus.
Harris contemplates sending out companies, and several
other impresarii will do the same, including George
Edwardes, who is to be lessee of the gorgeous new Johan-
nesburg theatre now being built by Barney Barnato’s
Investment Co. —the land upon which it is to stand cost
£40,000. Sass is to be Edwardes’s local representative.
May Fortescue had a tolerably successful tour in South
Africa, under the management of our old friend Searelle.
She did wonderfully well in the various coast towns, hut
was rather a frost in Johannesburg, owing to her
imperious ways. She wound up by coming to logger-
heads with Searelle, who had to remind her of the differ-
ence between running a co. “ on her own ” and being lead-
ing lady simply (call it “ star,” if you will) under an
impresario. She did not capture the expected mil-
lionaire.
Nellie Stewart plays the title role in “ The Shopgirl ”
in America in the place of Ellaline Terriss, who has shifted
to London to replace Ethel Ilaydon. Nellie, so far, has
got poor press notices in the Land of Wooden Hams.
At Richmond (Melb.): “Grand Minstrel and Variety
Show. Admission —a silver coir, i r three bottles.”
The new quartet by Prof. Marshall Hall, which has
lately been performed gmd praised in England, is the work
which nearly got lost in a drain-pipe last year. The Prof,
was going home late at night from a suburban party,
when he fell into a gutter and broke his collar-bone; the
MS. of his quartet, which he was carrying in his hand,
floated down the drain, and was stopped in its course by
the corpse of a cat.
Flo Young is alleged to possess the proper Trilby foot.
Joe Sweeny should make an efficient Svengali, and Alfred
Dampier ought to fill Taffy. George Lauri, with a judi-
cious song or two thrown in, and the necessary bad
French, shoukl shine as the Laird o’ Cockpen, whilst the
difficult part of Little Billie might suit New Boy Roberts.
The question (writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent) was recently asked—“ Has Ada Crossley realised
the hopes and expectations of her friends?” I, for my own
part, must say that she has not. Whether it is that the
friends aforesaid overrated her ability ; whether they
spoilt her by undue adulation ; or whether the rather
chilly lady has really no love or taste for her profession (I
suspect this is at least partly the cause), she has not come
to the front as was expected. Of course she started by
making the mistake of throwing over Santley for Mar-
chesi, and though the great baritone is too chivalrous to
bear malice towards a lady, and raised no cabal against
her, there is little doubt that a kind of adverse prejudice
was created thereby. Anyhow, be the reason what it
may, she has, to put it mildly, been parlously near want
of success all through the piece. It is said that she made
a success with Harrison’s concert co. in the provinces,
but I have not read a single criticism which might not
have been written about any ordinary singer/ I believe
she is to sing at the next Patti concerts at the Albert
Hall, and that means something.”
Another version. “The Brookmans, of Adelaide, who
put Ada Crossley in Great Boulders, have recently pre-
sented her with a parcel of Oroya shares. Ada has
returned to the method of voice-production favored by
her Meib. teacher, Madame Simonsen, and through that
or something else her voice is daily improving. She sang
again at the Queen’s Hall on 4th Jan., when Clara Butt
and Belle Cole were once more pitted against the Aus-
tralian, who more than held her own. Miss Crossley’s
great chance comes in March next, when she sings with
Patti in the Royal Albert Hall.”
Adey Brunei and her husband, pupil and manager,
leave London in April for America. Adey is a niece of
a distinguished gentleman, who, besides being a physician
to Queen Victoria, is also a brother of Her Most Gracious,
so that Miss Brunei is really in the happy position of being
able to call the Queen her aunt.
Vic. Assembly has passed the third reading of the bill to
prevent Sunday performances at the theatres. The bung-
ness of the times has already pretty well effected that
pious purpose, but an amiable desire to give the churches
a show prompts Respectable members to prepare for a
possible revival. Framing the measure so as to exclude
churches was found somewhat awkward, and it is not
quite certain now that the Rev. Deuteronomy Jones will
be justified under the Act in sending round the church
dinner-service.
Mesmerist Kennedy claimed to be the original of Du
Maurier’s Svengali, the hypnotic musician in “ Trilby.”
Kennedy had a circumstantial story about an incident in
a N.Y. drawing-room when he and Du Maurier were pre-
sent, which he worked off on callow interviewers. Du
Maurier, in a recent interview, declares there was no
original for Svengali—the character was purely imaginary.
The rush for seats for the first week of Robusto God-
frey’s season induced Rickards to shove up prices 6d.
Godfrey can rip jingo songs off his chest with more gusto
than any other man living, and throws so much patriotism
into his melodious bellow that his presenoe in Melbourne
during the recent loyal frenzy would probably have led to
the gutting of every 7 German-sausage shop in the city 7.
In the future policemen on duty at Melb. theatres are to
be changed regularly. The peeler who is always there
grows sympathetic towards the House and usually 7 lends a
hand in loading the gallery and leading the applause.
Possibly, too, fewer Melb. ballet-girls will marry police-
men now.
Augustus Harris offered the part of Cinderella in Drury
Lane pantomime to Ethel Hay 7 don, but George Edwardes
would not release her, and is about to send her to America
to play with one of his companies there. The “ woodiness
of ankle,” which The Bulletin noticed when Ethel played
in Melb. Princess’s pantomime, is the only thing that
prevents her from thoroughly setting the Thames on fire.
Henry Stockwell’s wife and family have joined him in
London, and are now settled at Fulham, where Leminone
also lives. Mine. Sherwin, who introduced them both to
Sydney audiences, has lost none of her interest in them,
and often secures engagements for both. T. M. Jackson
is another who owes much to the Tasmanian singer’s kind
intervention. Jackson and George Clutsam both live with
Mme. Minna Fischer and her mother in St. John’s Wood.
Clutsam is said to be turning out music which “ must one
day bring the world to his feet.”
Florence Wilton’s Catherine wheel must be a reminis-
cence of her “ Jack-in-the-Box,” which she played at the
Strand Theatre some years ago. She isn't quite as agile
a Catherine-wheeler as her predecessor in the part,
Fannie Leslie.
Extract from letter from “ pro.” to “ pro.” :—“ Lie back
in your chair and think of the solvent managers in Aus-
tralia, and if you know as much as I do you will be able
to count them on one hand without the slightest argu-
ment with yourself.”
Professional play-pirates still exist in N.S.W. and the
other provinces. A correspondent was offered the scrip
of one of Lestocq’s most popular comedies, the other day,
mb rosa, for £l. If “Plain Bill” Holloway could only
cast his eagle eye on that pirate !
“ Plain Bill” Holloway and his co. are doing huge biz
in Johannes urg. His daughters, Theo and Juliet, who
are both acting with him, are unusually pretty girls,
Juliet especfffily, who much resembles “ our Essie ” but is
of fairer complexion.
Florence Young has lately taken very seriously to the
study of music and voice-culture with a view to higher-
class engagements in the future.
At Hobart recently the girls of the Comic Opera Co
played a cricket-match against the officers of the Orlando.
How the Hobart girls did glare at the poachers on their
preserves ! The Hobart girls think they have a mortgage
on anything 7 wearing brass buttons.
The advt. of Miss Polly Emery’s farewell benefit at
Sydney Royal announced that the performance would be
supported by Brough and Boucicault’s famous co., Alfred
Woods’s talented co., also Westmacott’s co., Rickards’s
co., and the Criterion co. Further, it differentiated
between Mr. C. B. Westmacott, who assisted with his co.,
and C. B. Westmacott, Esq., who lent the Royal for the
occasion. Consider the nice gradations—the famous co.,
the talented co., the three other co.’s, and the man who is
partly Esq. and partly not !
Purves, they say, doesn’t like Champion. The story
goes that they first met behind scenes at a B. and B. per-
formance -both at the invitation of B. the Second. Before
they had been introduced, Purves chanced to make a
remark on the subject of the drama which Champion
thought silly—and said so. Boucicault sought to draw a
herring across the track by introducing them to each
other. Quoth Purves, “So you’re H. H. Champion !
Well, you may know something about the Labor-question,
but you know very little about the drama! ” Re-
joined Champion, “So you’re Purves, are you? Well,
you may know something about law, but you know
very little about manners ! ”
Q. Govt.-party saj sprayers night and morn-
ing for Glassey—“ the best friend Boodlewraith
has. ” Glassev’sdefenders lay continual stress on his
incorruptibility—“ lie’s an ass, we grant you, but
look what a phenomenally honest ass ! ” As the
effect of his honesty is to keep the party of dis-
honesty in power, the country pines for a little
more capacity and a few less scruples.

One of the tragedies of the “heat-wave”
tvas played on the Bourke-Wanaaring track to-
wards Mt. Brown, in one of the hungriest parts of
the far north-west (N.S.W.). J. P. M‘Cann,
partly losing his eyesight, lost also a Gov. billet;
but instead of sitting down while his wife went
washing for a living, or worrying the Minister for
an allowance, he bought a wheelbarrow and a
magic-lantern and started for Bourke, pushing
through the shearing-sheds and way-back towns.
The liberality of the bushmen soon enabled him
to buy a horse and sulky, and with these he
started out to “do ” the N.W. corner of N.S.W
and the Queensland border towns, taking his nine-
year-old son with him. Twelve miles from Tin-
neroo bore, in one of the hottest days, he left the
sulky (the horse was “done”) and made a
desperate struggle to find a tank which he believed
to be somewhere near the track. He failed,
dragged himself to the sulky, and insisted upon
his boy moistening his own lips with the few drops
of water which the latter had saved for his father..
Then they drove the horse on, and reached the
bore; but the man died within a few hours.
POLICY.
“ You have dirtied your jacket. What ever will your mother say? ”
“If mother says anything about it, I'll change the conversation.”
Concerning deaths from heat-apoplexy or heat-
stroke in the bush, it is remarkable how few there
are. When the sun is gone, the average traveller
assumes the danger to be past, and throws himself
on the hot ground, as likely as not without unroll-
ing his blankets, and prepares to sleep. Out in
the far West (N.S.W.) the thermometer has fre-
quently run up to past 100 in the shade at
nights ; and at these times even healthy people,
lying in hammocks, have felt a strong inclination
to “ let themselves go to slide into unconscious-
ness. Add the heat of the ground, and the temp-
tation would be often absolutely irresistible. This
may, perhaps, explain the phenomenon of two
men, who had apparently been suffering from
thirst, being found dead under the one tree on
Nundora, without any trace of a final struggle.
* * * *
During the recent hot weather in the
South the North has been, by comparison, beauti-
fully cool. While Brisbane sweltered, Bourke
broiled, and Thargomindah stewed, Northern
towns, like Townsville, the Towers, and Hughen-
den, smiled a smile of placid peace and thanked
Heaven they were too far North to catch the heat-
wave. Wragge wrath fully predicted Sheol in the
shade, but the North only smiled —the prediction
was out of it.

New South Wales prayed for rain and got<
a little sprinkled over those parts of the province
where it was least required, and then the drought
started again. Victoria prayed for rain and got a
little, but not enough to save its grain-crops from
being more than half-ruined. Queensland didn’t
pray for it, and it came down in oceans in quite
an unsolicited way, and washed away a good part
of Townsville, and nearly drowned a Supreme
Court judge, and swamped the local daily paper
to such an extent that it couldn’t publish for two
days, and it partially drowned Rockhampton, and
left half the province with hardly a dry shirt for
twp weeks, and reduced the Central Railway to
such a state that passengers have to be conveyed
long distances in boats over an unexpected inland,
sea. And this is what people call the Efficacy of
Prayer.

The Bulletin notices that that little tin
Windeyer, the snappish Judge Docker, has been
sitting from early morning until about midnight
at Bathurst Criminal Sessions. It must be the
Judges themselves who are responsible for such
outrages on justice; for if they objected, the
Crown Law Department would not dare to insist,
at the risk of having the matter publicly dis-
cussed.

There will shortly be published by a well-
known managing-clerk “A guide for litigants ab
the Courts of Petty Sessions, Melbourne district.”
This will enable one to know what justices can be
approached and how; also the solicitors who are
friends of certain magistrates, and before whom
they always bring their cases, thereby scoring
wins, and in civil matters getting liberal costs
awarded; also how to pack benches, and the
attorneys keenest at the game ; also what justices
can be approached privately for bail and judiciously
squared by being handed a sov. or fiver (according
to the gravity of the case) to pay cab-hire, and not
be asked for the change. Price 215., of all book-
sellers.

The moral of the big pastoral law-suit, on

ticular reason why he should continue to respect

The Bulletin would like to know whether
a certain leading Melb. solicitor was ever ap-
proached, previous to appearing for defendant in a
police-court case, by a certain honorary justice ?
And whether the J.P. came to the solicitor with a
distressful story re his immediate necessity for a
.£lO cheque, whieQ the solicitor, groaning like a
dentist’s victim, reluctantly supplied ?

Gov. Hampden has said, in almost as
many words, that he doesn’t see why he should be
bothered to attend every paltry church-bazaar and
missionary-meeting. All reasonable people will
sympathise with H.E.’s determination. The
system he has found so galling chiefly dates from
the reign of the unspeakable Gov. Carington, who
was so grovellingly anxious to propitiate every-
body that he would attend with all his suite at the
opening even of a box of sardines.

Melbourne Herald abuses Prempeh, of
Ashantee:—
Meanwhile, the obstinacy of this petty young savage
has been attended with mischievous consequences, the
ultimate reach of which we do not yet know. Prince
Henry of Battenberg is dead, and the Queen’s favorite
daughter left a widow.
And all because a mischievous nig hoped to save
his country from the clutches of the omnivorous
Bull. The point is that no savage should go to
such a length in defending his possessions as to
afford one of Queen Victoria’s German relatives an
opportunity of getting his feet wet in the service
of the Empire.

The antiquated tele-
graph system of Westralia
seems to have definitely
broken down under the
strain of extra business.
Some of the messages lying
in the office at Perth are
now 15 days old, and
could have reached Mel-
bourne or Sydney much
faster by steamer. Perth
officials acknowledge that
they have given up all
hope of ever overtaking
the accumulation, so it
seems that the business is
to remain in arrears until
the Day of Judgment. The
pile of ancient messages
will probably be packed in
a barrel shortly, and sent
East by steamer, or gradual
brig, or started across the
continent per camel, and
then things will be a little
easier for a while, but in a
week or two the trouble
will be in full blast again.
“Urgent” messages are
abolished now in the West,
as it is a mere mockery to
call a message “urgent”
and then take a fortnight
to deliver it. The born
Westralian can’t move fast
enough to get out of his
own road; he is a person
who sleeps in his velocity,
arid doesn’t hear of his own
death till three months
afterwards ; and a tortoise
in ballast would overtake
him any day and bite him
from behind for obstructing the roadway.
-Re Gov. Brassey’s announcement to his
Ministers that he intended to proceed to the
prorogation on horseback. The somewhat simple
old man began by explaining that although he had
bought Hopetoun’s gaudy State'carriage and
trappings, he did not intend to use them. He
trotted them out with six horses at Ballarat Exhi-
bition opening, but felt uncomfortable all the
wlnle. Ihe thing was too much like a circus.
He, therefore, intended to strike opt a new line
for himself, and ride to Parliament House “ On
a bike, sir ! anticipated Peacock, with his wild
hyaena laugh. “No, sir,” continued Brassev
solemnly, upon a horse.” “Yes, yes; with the
staff on bikes, put m the Premier encouragingly
Oh, no. said the Gov., “they can hire a
carnage “ Why not let them have the police
van . chipped in Duffy to Turner, sotto vocc, and
so on. Although Ministers received the old
gentleman’s ultimatum with official courtesy, thev
were greatly disturbed by it. On horseback, wilh
20 troopers behind and 20 before him, Brassey’s
progress was pictured in their minds as some-
thing similar to the entry, under heavy
escort, of a captured bushranger. The change,
which the Akgus described as “important,” is
believed to be the outcome of Brassey’s persistent
abhorrence of conforming to precedent. He only
has to be told how a thing has been done, to
determine to do it differently. This would be
laudable if it only went far enough. For instance,
if H.E. had said : “I don’t want any carriage, or
any escort. I’m going to the prorogation on a
thrippeny tram,” the Democracy would have
howled its great heart out with joy.

Two cable thrills :—
A sensational rumor was current to-day that Viscount
Milton, M.P., for Wakefield, had been killed while hu 1 ting,
his horse having been frightened by a train and thrown
him over a bridge. The rumor, however, proved to be
unfounded.
The Queen kissed Prince Alexander, the eldest son of
the late Prince Henry of Battenberg.
The S.M. Herald’s idea of foreign intelligence
for the enlightenment of Australian readers, is
that tlie Queen kissed somebody that hardly any-
body ever heard of, and that somebody whom no-
body ever heard of isn’t dead. And if that news
hadn’t come this country might have gone on
blindly imagining that the man it never heard of
really was dead, or that he had never been alive :
We offer up a thanksgiving because he isn’t dead.

At a Melb. inquest witness stated that
deceased (his wife) had had a ohild which lived a
couple of days. When it died the body was
placed in a box, and a boy in his employ put it
under his arm, and carried it to the cemetery, and
left it there. “ This is not singular,” commented
the coroner, “they simply put them in any hole
they come to. ” 1 rugality—few Melbournians cap

The most important; point for the consideration
of all persons who desire to possess photographs
of those nearest and dearest to them is with regard
to permanence rather than price. No photograph
that will turn yellow, break out in spots, or vanish
into nothingness within a few weeks can have its
value expressed in figures. When delivered, it
may shine like the enamelled mystery on a soap-

come to the surface. This may be regarded as
one of the certainties of cheap photography at per

topper. The noble owner had left his boiled Sun-
day hat on board, and the fact being discovered
at the last moment a breathless messenger sprinted
harbor to recover the lost adornment.
The Sunbeam had got her anchor up and was
about to make sail when the agent was seen fran-
tically waving himself round his head on the
beach, so the vessel was hove to and a boat sent
to fetch him. Then there was a long search for
the box with the desired article in it, and by the
time it was found and delivered the Sunbeam had
drifted so close inshore that she couldn’t get out
again. After she had gone aground the hat
was found to be still on board, the messenger
having departed with an empty box. It is a char-
acteristic yarn; the average Briton would go
back to the gates of perdition for his bell-topper
if he had accidentally left it there. If the Light

hat on, and had dropped that plug hat in the

The usual girl turned up the other day in
Melb. District Court with the usual story 9f
assault committed by a bold, bad man, but in
cross-examination her story got badly mixed up,
and finally she acknowledged, also as usual, that
her tale of wrong was wholly imaginary. The
bench dismissed the case “without any com-
ments,” and nothing further has been heard about
it up to date. The blessed theory that it is the
privilege of any woman in a state of moral dis-
repair to bring any kind of accusation against a
man, and then, when her tale collapses, to own up
and go away without being arrested for perjury,
still seems to hold good in Australia.

Hysterical Ethel Wright, the Gunnedah
(N.S.W.) girl who caused a sensation by accusing
a man of putting poison in the family flour-bin,
and who was sentenced to four years’ imprison-
ment for perjury, is shortly to become a mother,
and was married the other day in Tamworth Gaol
to the father of her child. As, therefore, she was
enceinte at the time of her offence, the case appears
more than ever one for medical enquiry.
Tasmania’s latest girl-horror has broken
up in the way such horrors usually do. The young
woman who cast herself head-first out of a railway-
carriage because the only other occupant, a man,
had taken out a bottle of cough-mixture, and
then turned up in a bruised state and gave him
into custody for attempting to chloroform and
outrage her, owned up in court that the said man
didn’t attempt to do either. He simply took the
cork out of a bottle, but he didn’t offer her the
bottle, or attempt to do anything whatever, and,
apart from the fact that there was a man and a
bottle, the story arose out of her own diseased
imagination. The Social Gimlet kind of uneasy
morality is responsible for a lot of incidents of
this sort. It gets hold of a nervous girl and
teaches her that she has to be always on the wild
high shriek to protect her modesty from imaginary
assaults, and some day, as a consequence, she
throws herself screaming out of a railway-carriage,
making a great exhibition of two open-work stock-
ings and a pair of calves as she goes but, and falls
on the line in a dishevelled state with her skirt
over her head, and the people in the rear carriages
view her from the windows as they go by.
Down South, the other day, a lot of New
Women shrieked and sobbed over the mournful
(inquest) case of a young lady who, poor innocent,
had been seduced and had a child at the early age
of 2G. The villainous seducer was a ruffian of 18
years. The same afternoon the same set of
humorists went and interviewed members of
Parliament on the congenial subject of the Age of
Consent—as regards women.

Surgeon O’Hara, at Auckland Medical

So long as scrofulous children were produced they must
expect tuberculosis as a disease to flourish. He had
known a flock-owner to give five hundred guineas for a
stud ram, and marry his daughter to a broken-down
strumous object.
The marvel is, not that O’Hara, who always has
the courage of his opinions, should have said this
thing, but that the S. M. Herald should have
published it in an un-Bowdlerised cablegram.

There are only three English importations
amongst the entire Wesleyan clergy of Victoria
and Tasmania. A patriotic example to the
Anglicans—by which they are not likely to profit.
A common Australian parson is not good enough,
as a correspondence-clerk (in holy orders) between
God and themselves, for ever so many high-
toned, so-called Australian Church of England
congregations. In that very phrase Church of
England lies the root of the whole trouble. Church -
members of a muddily-logical turn of mind deduce
from it that a Church of England must necessarily,
wherever situated, be manned by English parsons.
Hence these importations, of which members of
the Australian - Anglican clergy complain so
bitterly. As well say a Holy Trinity of England.

This isquite a common trick among certain registry -
keepers. They obtain a man a situation, charge
him a fee equal to at least a week’s wages, and
then cold-bloodedly try to get him dismissed for
their own benefit.

And there I kissed the Book.

The Wild-Cat Column,
The Commercial Bank of Australia has decided
to appeal to its reconstructed depositors for a reduction
of interest, and probably an extension of time also. The
announcement was made by the same old James Service
who, less than three years ago, foresaw that the Com-
mercial’s preference shares would soon sell at £lO each,
and the deposit-receipts would be as good as gold, or
nearly so. Old James was brave to the last; even when
he announced that his big bank was once more in very
shallow water he pointed out that the institution had,
since ’93, paid off over £2,000,000 of its liabilities, and the
fact that it had done so largely by taking deposit-receipts
inpayment of overdrafts, &c., was judiciously left out.
Also, he added that the total liquid assets of the “ new
bank ” were equal to 60s. in the £ of the “ new bank’s ”
liabilities—which they are, only unhappily these assets
have also got to cover a lot of the liabilities of the old
bank, about which nothing was said at all.
The cause assigned for the proposed re-construc-
tion is the impossibility of paying 4J per cent, on fixed
deposits, with interest at its present low figure. As a
matter of fact, the Commercial of Australia has now only
£7,888,118 of old deposits on hand ; it pays 4J- per cent, on
£5,773,778 of these, and on the other £2,114,340 (converted
into preference shares) it pays nothing at all. Therefore,
it only pays about £260,000 a year in interest, which,
spread over the whole amount owing, means that the
rate is £3 6s. per cent. And when it can’t earn that,
the Commercial of Australia must be in a pretty bad way.
According to its own showing, it appears to have actually
realised last half-year only some £58,500 gross profit on
the £6,150,000 of the old bank’s unliquidated assets, equal
to less than 2 per cent, per annum. Assuming that this
£6,150,000 is supposed to be lent out at only 4* per cent.,
this would mean that about £3,500,000 is returning no
interest at all, and, if so, it seems probable that a good
deal of the principal is lost as well as the interest. The
£4,000,000 of paid-up capital, and the other £1,100,000
that has yet to come in should be more than sufficient to
provide for everything, if concessions can be obtained in
the meantime, but a big writing-down seems inevitable,
unless the Commercial can get very large concessions in-
deed from its creditors.
One way out of the difficulty would be to make
no more hard and fast agreements with the depositors.
A good form of compromise would be to provide that,
say, £50,000 a-year should be devoted out of the actually
realised profits to paying off depositors, to be selected by
ballot; that all the remaining profits should be devoted to
paying interest on deposits up to the agreed upon 41 per
cent, that of any profits realised over and above the 4-i
per cent., and the £50,000 paid in reduction of deposit
principal, one-half should go to a reserve fund to be in-
vested in Government securities, and the other half
should also go towards paying off deposits. Under this
scheme, if the bank gets no worse, the depositors would
probably receive 3£ per cent, in the immediate present,
and as the amount of their claims was reduced by the
acceptance of deposit-receipts in payment of debts and
by the repayment of £50,000 a year in cash, and by any
other repayments which might be possible, the interest
would probably rise again by degrees to the old 4J per
cent. Another device is the plain, crude idea of asking
for a reduction to 2£ or 3 per cent.—the same request
which the irate British shareholders sat upon so heavily
in the City of Melb. case. Another, and the best of ali,
would be for the Vic. Government to offer 2 or 2£ per
cent, debentures, redeemable at its own option any time
within, say, 20 years, in lieu of the reconstructed deposits,
to put the bank under the strict supervision of a State
auditor until all the guaranteed claims are paid in full,
and devote the £lOO,OOO or £130,000 a year thus saved to
writing off the bad assets, with the capital to fall back
upon for further writing-off purposes if absolutely neces-
sary. There is hardly the remotest possibility that the
State could lose by this process, and probably even the
shareholders would lose nothing in the end. And the
one thing to be kept in mind is that Victoria doesn’t want
to run even the most outside risk of any more big liquida-
tions just now under any circumstances.

The Sydney and Suburban Hydraulic Power
Co. shows a steadily increasing business and pays a div.
for the half-year at the rate of 7J per cent, per annum,
and, after making liberal allowances for depreciation, &c.,
it ends the year £737 better off than it was at the begin-
ning. One remarkable feature of the balance-sheet, how-
ever, is that £1539 of the assets consist of an unsettled
law-case—£939 of a claim upon a guarantee co. which is
carrying the matter to appeal, and £6OO of law expenses
which will be recovered if the appeal goes the right way,
while if it goes wrong they won’t be, and the Hydraulio
Co. may also be struck with the other party’s law-bill.
Considering the awful uncertainty of law, this £1539 isn’t
much of an asset and should be regarded with grave
suspicion. Another asset is “ Parliamentary rights and
concessions, £15,000.” Probably they are worth that
money, but the co. did not pay £15,000 for them so
far as the public is aware, and yet the sheet would show a
serious deficiency if the amount wasn’t there, and, in any
case, the practice of squaring a balance-sheet by the in-
sertion of a more or less undefinable item for goodwill is
always questionable. Further, the Hydraulic Co., though
distinctly prosperous and with a most promising future
before it, seems to be declaring a £2812 dividend with
only £2l ss. cash in hand and a £123 overdraft to pay it
out of.
* * * *
The Ballarat Banking Co. has a net profit for
the half-year ended 31st December of £3463, against
£3449 last half, and after paying the usual div. of 5£ per
cent, per annum there is £1125 to add to profit and loss,
making the balance carried forward £3409. The Ballarat
Bank never attempts nowadays to get beyond its un-
obtrusive 5£ per cent., and if it is well-advised it will
remain at that and keep adding to its reserve-fund for
many years to come. The cash and Government deben-
tures amount to £80,300, equal to nearly 36 per cent, of
the liabilities to the public. It has no costly branches, so
the total expenses average only £2500 a year, no note
circulation, and no English deposits ; if it liked to call up
the remainder of its little capital it. could pay off its entire
liabilities in cash, even if all its investments went bad
together ; it has kept out of Melbourne, and consequently
out of the boom; it has only £3650 worth of modest
premises and furniture; and by its strict avoidance of the
policy of wanting to own the whole earth, it is now the
most distinctly prosperous of all the Victorian banks.

Scrap of evidence in the Mercadool land-cases :
“Jeremiah Roberts, of the Assets Company, was then
called and his examination continued. He said that the
company lent money on conditional purchases, and also
on conditional and homestead leases. The charge for
interest varied, according to the nature of the security,
sometimes the company charged as high as 20 per cent.,
and sometimes as low as 10 per cent,, their charge on an
average being about 15 per cent. In addition to this
they charged 2$ per cent, to 5 per cent, commission." An
average of 15 per cent, and 2J to 5 per cent, commission!
When is the State Land Bank coming along ? On this 15
per cent, average the interest on a £5OO advance would be
£75 a year. And with a decently-managed State Land
Bank, £85 a year would cover interest and also repay the
principal in about 25 years.

The Metropolitan Mutual Permanent Building
and Investment Association shows a loss for ’95 of £3658,
whioh seems to be about its normal condition nowadays.
Some of the items in its revenue-account are calculated
to make the Association feel rather serious in its mind.
One property, which is valued at £12,060, seems to have
returned £272 in rents—equal to a little over 2 per cent.,
and £226,000 worth of property seems to have yielded
about 2£ per cent, all round. These properties are care-
fully moored down by £100,000 worth of mortgages, which
apparently swallow up all the rent-receipts, and perhaps
a little more. If the Metropolitan had been content to
own just as much property as it could pay for, the fall in
rents would simply have meant a reduction in the profits,
but it tried to own a lot more, and now the interest ap-
parently eats up the rent and a lot of the profits
of the ordinary business as well. The curse of building-
society business in Australia has been the desire to have
£100,000 capital and to borrow £100,000 more on deben-
tures, and then, with that £200,000, to buy a £500,000
property and owe £300,000 of the purchase-money on
mortgage, and carry on the rest of the business by getting
£80,000 of deposits.

That good old Tory paper, the Australasian,
by way of pointing out the evils of a State Bank and a
State note-issue, and the beauties of the private busted-
reconstruct-15s.-in-the-£-boom-smash-revelations system,
remarks : “ While we in Victoria were passing through
our recent financial troubles not the slightest anxiety was
felt about the bank-notes, nor was there any rush to
change them into gold. Even the Federal Bank notes
were always worth par.” So they were, after the other
banks agreed to give 20s. in the £ for them and take the
risk themselves in the hope of averting a panic. But in
the very brief interval before that consummation Federal
notes were sold at 18s., if not less. And when the
Oriental Bank broke a large quantity of its notes changed
hands at 16s. And when the bank panic was in full blast
in Sydney the writer went to spend a Saturday afternoon
and Sunday in a decent-sized town 60 miles from the city,
and nearly had to camp out in the street because he had
no gold with him and the local Goths wouldn’t offer more
than 15s. in the £ for notes, and didn’t really want to
take them at all. Said notes, too, were those of a bank
which, after all, didn’t close or reconstruct.

The very newest thing in small finance. Bal-
main (Sydney) New Ferry Co. calls for tenders for a new
steamer. Any persons proposing to tender must first send
in their names and a deposit of £5 5s., “which will be
returned on their submitting a bona fide tender, i.e.,
within 15 per cent, of the one accepted.” If it isn’t
within 15 per cent, of the one accepted, the money, pre-
sumably, will be confiscated by the co. And, as a suc-
cessful tenderer may come along who submits a pheno-
menally low offer, because he means to swindle the people
who supply the materials, or because he is going broke
anyhow, and is, therefore, reckless of consequences, or
because he intends to build on shoddy principles, or
through sheer blundering in his estimates, the result may
be that the £5 5s. of every honest tenderer will be for-
feited.

To put an end to certain misapprehensions

apparently 17,000 bogus ones—not that he had that mis-

He has the misfortune to be the man who has to sort

Bendigo Electric Lighting Co., a local concern,
has made for the last year a profit equal to about 12 per
cent, on the capital. As it has to compete with the gas-
supply its prices are necessarily moderate, and the above
12 per cent, was made not by extortion but by good
management. The Sydney people who want to job away
their far bigger electric-light concession to a British co.
should think hard over this. The local corporation wants
the profit quite as badly as any British co. can do.

There is trouble ahead for the dealers in railway
and steamer tickets. It has been customary, when a
name was marked on a ticket, to alter the sex by adding
“a” to Mr. or scratching it out, as the case might be. A
scalper is now under committal in Melb. for this offence,
described as “ forgery.” Perhaps it technically is forgery,
but, seeing that the value of the ticket (which is a con-
tract to carry an adult) is not altered, the crime is a very
venial one. ' It is also hinted that the N.S.W. Railway
Commissioners may bring forward an action for con-
spiracy. But surely the commissioners and steamship-
owners can grasp the situation without going about it in
such a round-about and expensive way? They could
make the dealer shut-up shop at once by buying back,
less (say) 10 per cent, discount, unused halves of return-
tickets. Some steamship-owners do this, which is the
only equitable way out of the difficulty, and but a just
acknowledgment of the equitable rights of a ticket-holder.

cost £2755, material, £2276; wages, £3780 ; and freight,£7B.

Since the passing of the N.S.W. amended
Superannuation Act, enabling civil servants who feel that
way to cease being contributors to the fund —a concession
of which the lady-teachers have largely availed them-
selves—the Govt, offices and public-schools have been
simply rushed by life-assurance canvassers. What a big
chance the N.S.W. Govt, has missed by not inaugurating
a State Life-Assurance Dept, before amending the old
Act, and compelling civil servants to insure in the State
office ! By the way, it is not generally known that,
should a c.s. wish to resign the service, it is necessary for
him to give notice of withdrawal from the Superannua-
tion Fund before forwarding his resignation. Should he
resign first and then apply for his contributions to the
fund, he gets “ nix.”

The gross weight received by Sydney Mint for coinage
during 95 was 760,1210 z.—the smallest record since’B9.
In ’93 and ’94 the gross value of gold topped the three
million mark, but for ’95 it is only £2,768,447. This raises
a query as to whether the policy of the Mint in making a
high coining-charge is justified. Gold raised in N.S.W.
is charged 6d. an ounce for coinage, in lots under
500 oz- a rebate of one penny an ounce being allowed
on “ foreign” gold. Vic. Mint charges 2d. an ounce
for similar lots to all comers. Sydney Mint misses
about 100,000 oz. of the annual N.S.W. production
but practically every oz. of Vic. gold is minted in Melb.’
The Sydney policy of penalising the local producers in
favor of the Bananalanders and Maorilanders is a
peculiarly ignoble method of financing. Melb. and Sydnev
mintage rates compare as follows
In the matter of silver contents of gold Svdnev
is nominally more liberal than Melbourne-Sydnev retain-
mg 2 per cent, and Melbourne 8 per cent. l'n the present
state of the silver-market, this amounts to practically
nothing. The coming charges should be overhauled, and
as the regulations are subject to the Governor-in-Council’s
abouHt ’ SOmethln§: can be done if the authorities care
’95 is the record year for Melb. Mint with
1,092,5200 z. gross mintage, the value being £4,288,356. Of
this amount it issued £4,165,869 in sovereign* nearly 30
tons. Sydney’s coin issue was £2,758,000.

two months the weekly yields dropped badly—poorest,
306 tons for 320 z.— as the good 15ft. stone above the 300 ft.
level dipped underfoot, and the co. is now shaft-sinking

POLITICAL
POINTS
A Boer view: “ Ring ’’-land, Roam and
Booty.
All the Labor members who sat in last
S.A. Assembly are to be nominated by the party
at the next elections.
Premier Seddon, it now appears, has not
appointed himself a salaried, but a purely gratis,
liquidator of the B.N.Z. Estates Co.
During ’95, not one Australian province
changed its Ministry. Not even South Australia,
the province of six-months’ Cabinets.
Byrnes’s chance for North Brisbane with
remainder to the Premiership has been to some
extern, scotched, or rather Irished, by the recent
controversy re sectarian appointments to the Civil
Service.
Donald ion is Opposition candidate for N.
Brisbane, chief stronghold of Property, and the
lair of the plural voter. But Queen-street prefers
a safe Tory numskull to an able man free from
the hide bound theories of the Ass. Here’s luck,
anyway !
Two ex-sneriffs are walking about Mel-
bourne hale and hearty (retired because they were
over 60). Another man is paid full salary to do
their work, but an economical Government thinks
these two too feeble to do aught but draw heavy
pensions.
Max Hirsch has been treating Melb. to his
views of a Federal Constitution for Australia.
But since Ernperor William took to tweaking the
Lion’s tail, Max has resumed his former appearance
of a “darned foreigner,” and his eloquence is
under a cloud.
Sangster, M.L.A. (Port Melbourne), stated
recently in Vic. Assembly that when people in
Australia wanted “a crawling thing” like a
clergyman they sent to Scotland for it, but when
they wanted fighting men they imported them
from England. Sangster may now say farewell
to the haggis-and-whisky vote.
BEWARE OF CHILLS.
BOURKE. —It is much cooler to-day. The thermometer is down to 117 in the
shade.— Weather report daring heat-wave.
Sister Jessie (to brother Bill, the bullock-puncher): “Bill, ain’t yer better take
yer overcoat an’mutfler? It might go down to one hundred this afternoon
an’ you’d be froze! ”
The Turner Gov. opposed the proposal to
establish a minimum wage of 6s. a-day for male
adults casually employed in Vic. Railway Depart-
ment. If carried, the amendment would force
the Gov. either to raise the necessary money by
increased taxation or sack the cheap old men and
get better ones and less of them, asid the Pre-
mier. Which implies that a great many of the
men in the employ of the department are not get-
ting 6s. a day:
Quite possible the Turner Ministry will be
reconstructed. The move is to retire Williams
from the railways, and give the brainy Peacock a
chance of knocking that octopus dept, into com-
mercial shape. Also, another Minister may be
got rid of—the man, too, the Vic. public nave
least thought of in this direction.
Bananaland is desperately police and
soldier ridden. It costs that sultry province
<£234,710 a year to pay police and military ex-
penses. Nearly 200 police are stationed in Bris-
bane alone, while Northern towns of from ten to
twenty thousand inhabitants are often stuffed
with from ten to a score of constables.
And here is S.M. Herald talking in a
leader of the United States as “a nation of
70,000,000 Anglo-Saxons.” Say 9,000,000 Ger-
mans, 10,000,000 Irish, 10,000,000 niggers, 1,000,000
or 2,000,000 each of Scandinavians and Italians—
besides Spaniards, Dutchmen, Russian and Polish
Jews, and all the rest. Anglo-Saxon !
Max Hirsch has been thrown over by
Melb. Freetraders since the discovery by the
A.rgus of one West, a Freetrade gabbler without
Single-tax trimmings. Freetrade has slumped
heavily in Vic. farming districts, the recent bad
season having convinced most wavering agricul-
turists of the advantages of a home market.
Again the Jap. The sugar-refining indus-
try of Hongkong is likely to receive a death-blow
now the Japs own Formosa. The Chinese Sugar-
refining Co. of Hongkong at first paid divs. of 8 to
12 p.ei, and in 1889, 25 p.c. Formosa grows plenty
of cane, and already the Jap. is busy raising re-
fineries. Another rival for the Bananaland planter.
If the Labor-members of Vic. Assembly
would like to reveal a very ancient scandal they
might call for ‘ ‘ papers ” re the Government sale
and purchase of sundry fine freehold properties
lying south of St. Kilda (Melb.) Cemetery. Old
inhabitants remember that the original cemetery
reserve included many acres of land which some-
how or other got diverted from burial purposes.
Legal bills go through Parliament without
the slightest discussion, as a rule, save by interested
legal members. And this although important
changes of principle may be involved. Such a
recent piece of legislation as the Married Woman’s
Property Act is surely not too recondite for the
ordinary member to master when changes are
being made. Vic. Assembly has just passed an
amendment of it, trusting to lawyer Duffy’s
assurance that there was “nothing in it.” Per-
haps there isn’t, but in 1884 Parliament thought it
advisable to confine the liability of women on
their contracts to cases where they actually had
property at the time of the contract. The new
bill alters this altogether, and greatly extends
their liability.
Maoriland
has long been
pondering over
the possibility
of a ship canal
from Onehunga
to Auckland,
right across the
province, which
just there is
only six or seven
miles wide. It
is level country,
the work would
be easy, and it
would bring
Auckland a
good 300 miles
nearer to Syd-
ney, and boom
the West Coast
immensely.
Now the old
wheeze comes
along that
“ British capi-
tal ” may possi-
bly be invited
to take the
matter up.
When these
provinces aren’t
leaning against
a lamp-post
anyone who
wants them in
a hurry can
always find
them leaning
against British
capital. What a
blessed relief it
would be to
hear of some-
body or any-
body doing any-
thing in Aus-
tralasia without
the assistance
of British capi-
tal! The “colo-
nial’’can hardly
fall downstairs
without the aid
of British capi-
tal.
Coolgardie
district has one
member and a
population of
many thou-
sands. Yet the
members of the
Forrest Govt, are elected by a few hundred votes.
The Bulletin earnestly invites the
opponents of payment of members in Melbourne
to calmly contemplate their unpaid magistracy—
including Mr. Kelly.
According to the cable, the United States
Congress is solemnly passing a Bill for the
abolition of the blood-stained Sultanate of Turkey,
and the establishment on its ruins of a kind of
republic with a Christian president at its head.
And Abdul-Hamed, who even now can probably
muster 400,000 of the hardest-fighting soldiers in
Europe, will tell Uncle Sam to come along with his
army of 2(5,000 men and shift him out of the
Caliphate if he can.
MISS NEW WOMAN: “ Well?”
Johnson, the alleged perjurer, who was
sentenced to three years’ imprisonment over the
notorious Butler case, while the influential Rofe,
who was admittedly a worse offender in the same
matter, went free, had the remainder of his sen-
tence remitted, according to the S.M. Herald,
because of “ the peculiar nature of the surround-
ing circumstances of the case.” Now that the
Herald has admitted their existence, will it give
its opinion as to what these peculiar surroundings
consist of? The fact that the surroundings were
dreadfully peculiar has already been admitted by
almost everybody else.
Yic. Minister of Health recently referred
to directions issued to the police to set the con-
tagious diseases part of the Health Act in force in
special cases only. Is this constitutional ? Isn’t
it perilously near a “ high crime and misde-
meanor,” in fact the same “suspending” an Act
of Parliament for which James 11. was kicked out
of England ? Several instances of such repealing
of statutes by Ministers have lately occurred ;
notably in connection with the Lunacy Acts. It
will not be long before we have the interminable
discussion re “ blue laws ” raging here as it is in
America. But Ministers must not be allowed to
be our legislators.
The Yic. Homestead Bill appears to omit
the important provision of the Act from which,
in the main, it is copied, limiting the amount of
land to which an indefeasible title can be got to
=£lsoo worth. It is doubly important that this
should be inserted, seeing that the Bill is being
introduced by a decidedly Conservative section of
the House. Its omission would mean the securing
of enormous areas or values of untouchable property
to the magnates of the next boom after its collapse.
The Bill is wise in principle, but its details need
careful attention to prevent the possibility of the
long chain of evils that necessitated, in Ireland,
the passing of the Encumbered Estates Act.
The S.A. National Ass is most active in its
election work, and money is being spent hopefully
in the attempt to capsize Premier Kingston and
party. So far, Works-Minister Jenkins is the
only Minister threatened in his own seat, and
much disgust is felt by Ministerialists at the
action of the Central Labor Executive in urging
the local labor committee to run two direct nomi-
nees for the discrict (Sturt). Relations are much
strained between Chairman M'Pherson, of the
U.L.P., and Premier Kingston on this subject.
Australian Labor-parties in general seem en-
amoured of the examples of the Boy and the Nuts
and the Dog and the Shadow. Who in his pro-
vince has done, and is doing, so much for demo-
cracy as Kingston ?
The other afternoon a sanctimonious hatter,
T. Smith, arose in Vic. Legislative Assembly to
ask the Minister of Railways a grave political
question. He wanted to know, did Smith,
M.L.A., whether it was an established fact that a
foreman in one of the railway goods-sheds had
become addicted to the crime of borrowing loose
silver from his mates. Smith apparently is one of
those highly respectable and always prosperous
citizens who nev-ev borrow and nev-e r lend.
Gov. Brassey, talking
of Protection to Melbourne
audiences, reminds one of
the stereotyped house-agent
advt. “ Hot and cold water
laid on. ”
William Copley, a col-
league of Kingston in Play-
ford’s Ministry, and who
later held office with Dow-
ner, was one of the origina-
tors of free education and
payment of members in
S.A. Copley was rejected
at the polls two years ago
because he went back on
his Democratic ideas, and
joined the Ass. crowd.
Now, William is again try-
ing to get into S.A. Assem-
bly as an opponent of free
education and payment of
members, and the one thing
the Democratic party badly
wants to do is to keep
“ Turncoat Bill ” out of the
Legislature.
Ex-Gov. Hopetoun was
pleased, some time ago, to
express his high vice-regal
approval of Victorian cham-
pagne, and now Governor
Brassey declares Victorian
ehablis to be “equal to
anything he has ever tasted
in any part of the world.”
Likewise, Victorian brandy
is now supplied to the
British army, having beaten
all competitors in a fair
trial. And it would seem
as if the Victorian, in con-
sideration of these high
foreign opinions, had re-
signed himself to drink his
own “ colonial ” liquors to
some extent, instead of
always loudly demanding
an inferior foreign article
at an advanced price. Any-
how, the imports of spir its
dropped from <£482,000
worth in ’BB to <£14(5,000
worth in _ ’93, and in the
same period the wine im-
ports declined from <£184,000
worth to <£30,000 worth.
Possibly Brassey’s enthusi-
asm on the subject may now
make them decline still fur-
ther ; if it does, then even
Brassey has his uses.
The cable :
The British residents in South Africa consider that the
amalgamation of the two nationalities would be hastened
if Great Britain controlled the African seaboard.
True. If J. Bull manages to so block in the Boers
that they have no chance of getting an opening to
the sea by way of Delagoa Bay, then they will be
practically imprisoned in the paunch of and soak-
ing in the gastric juices of J. Bull aforesaid.
Great is the power of Bung and his XXX
At the last annual licensing meeting in Welling-
ton, M.L., the only hotel-licenses cancelled were
those of “ untied ” houses. The police apparently
dare not seriously prosecute a “ brewer’s house ”
for breaches of the Act; so, to justify his exist-
ence, Roberto must attack the other. This spells
ruin to a publican who refuses to be tied by XXX.
and Co.—unless he happens to be prominent in
secret-society or pious circles. Clearly the State
must brew its own beer.
The latest rumor about Boodlewraith is
that Nelson, who is unwell and tired of politics,
will take the Agent-Generalship, MTlwraitb’s
condition being too bad even for this “ soft snap.”
Byrnes aspires to leadership, and will stand for
North Brisbane if he thinks the seat is sure; he
has issued what may be considered a valedictory
address to his Chinese and other supporters at
Cairns, but is trying to keep the back-door open
in case he’s routed down South. And Tozer is
working up the Orange faction for the expected
wrangle for Nelson’s place.
The true inwardness of Jameson’s cam-
paign, or “outrage” as the press would term it
were the nationalities reversed, is to be read
between the lines, not of the reading matter, but
the advts. of the South African press.
burg Star in a recent issue, containing about 15
columns of fulsome adulation of Dr. “Jim,” has
among its “ Outlanders’ Arise ” advts. one giving
the subscription - list towards the Outlanders’
defence-fund. This list opens with Eckstein
<£lo,ooo, Barnato <£lo,ooo, Neumann =£lo,ooo, and
gradually diminishes until the item “ Johannes-
burg Hebrew congregation, £100,” is reached.
Also, the medium contributors are mostly named
Abraham, or Woolff, or Cohen, or words to that
effect. Who doubts now that the whole “ patrio-
tic ” action was nothing more than a cleverly-
planned job on the part of Barnato, Rhodes and
Co. to rig the London Stock Exchange ?

Gerard Smith is a very poor success as
SV.A.’s alleged Governor, the real Governor being
Forrest. Smith says his greatest ambition is to
have people say of him, “Smith is an English
gentleman.”
An individual who figures as a shining
Geographical-Society light in Smellbourne, is the
hero of a story bearing on his knowledge of foreign
lands and peoples. A friend, speaking to him
about some white-haired, pink-eyed young ladies,
remarked that they were certainly albinoes.
“Now you mention it,” said the geographical
authority, “ I believe they do come from Albania.”
M. B. Stark, for 24 years clerk at Melb.
Police-court, who died the other day, was a re-
porter on Melbourne Heeald 35 years ago when
it was a morning paper owned by George Collins
Levey. He was visited in his last hours by
Father “Frank” Murphy, the Jesuit (aged 90),
who had taught him his A B C in Dublin 50 years
before.

Phil May, on hearing that a nugget closely
resembling the drawing over Sappho Smith’s
letter in The Bulletin, had been found at Cool-
gardie, and was to be presented to him, im-
mediately asked, “ Is it life-size ? ”
A prominent Pitt-street (Sydney) trader,
when banking his takings, daily entrusts the ple-
thoric bag to a messenger whom he follows closely
with a loaded revolver in each coat-pocket, his
hands firmly grasping the weapons.
Phil May’s modesty allows few people to
know that he has a most agreeable and sympa-
thetic tenor voice, which he uses very effectively.
Mrs. Phil May is an accomplished mandolin-
player, and now speaks French like a Parisian.
Circumstances alter cases. N.S.W. grog-
secretary Bevill now fights tooth-and-nail against
Woman-suffrage, because likely to interfere with
his paymaster, Bung. Yet he was once a foremost
champion of the Primrose League—really founded
on petticoat politics.
Westralian Gov.. Smith’s son, who at the
time of his father’s appointment was on an Argen-
tine cattle ranch, lately reached Perth and was
immediately appointed aide. He did not hold the
essential military copimission, but that difficulty
was got over by making him a second lieutenant
in the bloodthirsty Perth Volunteer Artillery.
Miss Morgan, daughter of Mr. W. Prit-
chard Morgan, M.P., who has lately been visiting
Coolgardie with her father, is his “right-hand
man ”in Welsh electioneering. W. P. M. himself
having come to Australia in his early youth, and
stayed here 25 years, has practically forgotten his
mother-tongue, but his children have been taught
Welsh, and Miss Morgan has more than once
appeared on the platform to deliver an oration in
the Cymric tongue, to the great delight of her
father’s constituents.
Old man Parkes’s furniture is once more
in the market, and attached to the auctioneer’s
advt. of the tables and chairs appears a letter
from the poor patriarch as follows :
Annandale,
January 25th, 1896.
Dear Sir, —Referring to our conversations concerning
the disposal of my effects, I hope you will do all you can
to give publicity to and make adequate arrangements for
the sale.
The things must be sold. I have no other means to
satisfy the claims against myself and to provide the neces-
saries of life for those dependent upon me.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) HENRY PARKES.
When Westralian Gov. Gerard Smith
stood to represent Hull in the Commons, during
the 1892 elections, he was a virulent Unionist, and
at a mass meeting, on the eve of polling-day, he
unfurled a gigantic Union Jack, and waved it
amidst great anti-Home-Rule enthusiasm. But
suddenly the cheers changed to laughter; a com-
mittee-man snatched the flag out of his hand and
tore from its folds a large placard marked “For
Sale,” which the shopkeeper from whom the
bunting was bought had forgotten to remove.
Next day Smith was defeated, a fact which he
always ascribes to that careless shopkeeper.
Eady, the Tasmanian cricketer, has been
put into the Australian Eleven more for what he
promises than for what he has done. He is a 24-
year-old athlete —cricketer, footballer, swimmer—
and a six-months-old lawyer. He stands 6ft. 4in.,
and is an unassuming giant of good nerve and
stamina. He can begin bowling top pace at noon
and at six be still bowling it. Herein he differs
from Jonah Jones, whose first six overs come like
cannon-shot, and who gets slower and slower till
his best is the pace of the old-man game of bowls.
Still, Eady’s fastest is far from Jones’s best rock-
’em-in-uns, and is about the pace of Albert Trott’s
wind-jammer. Eady is a good field and bat as
well as bowler ; his big performances are two cen-
turies in Tas. v. Vic. second eleven last season and
156 against M.C.C. the other day. His pace
should make him a dangerous bowler on fiery
English wickets, but on good English wickets
Grace, Shewsbury, Gunn, Stoddart, Ward, Abel,
Reid, Jackson—used to the scientific fast bowling
of Richardson, Lockwood and Mold—will probably
smile if Eady’s side has the temerity to play him.
The relatives of Dr. Lang are of opinion
that the time has not yet arrived for the compila-
tion of his biography from his family papers. If
the family wait until the old warrior’s ‘ Life can
be issued without giving offence to some one or
other section of the community, it will wait till
Lang’s statue descends from its pedestal in Wyn-
yard Square.
A recen) sxd event up North recalls (by
contrast) a story related of the late Mr. Justice
Higinbotham. A young lady, a friend of the
family, once said to him at his residence late on a
wet night as he put on his hat to see her to the
train : “ Never mind, your Honor, the housemaid
will come.” “You forget, my dear,” said the
considerate old Judge, “that the housemaid is
a woman.”
Gov. Brassey had real bad luck on his
Tasmanian trip. Crossing the Straits he got a
bit of funnel in his eye, which had to be extracted
in Hobart. On landing, his daughter was thrown
from her bicycle. At Norfolk Bay, the sea was
so rough that he could not communicate with
Admiral Bridge, though he badly wanted to. The
Sunbeam had to be towed up the river like a
mud-lighter, instead of putting on style. He and
the Chief Justice got lost in a fog on the
“ploughed field,” Mt. Wellington. Finally, the
Sunbeam ran aground, and scraped copper off her
bottom.

came back with a flea in
his ear, and a demand for a
senior clerk and a police

Hickman Molesworth,
now Judge of Insolvency
(Vic.), once defended a man
for stealing a neighbor’s
cow. The case was as clear
as day against accused, but
he was popular, while pro-
secutor wasn’t. Verdict,
“Not guilty.” “How-
ever did you come to let that
fellow off ? ” the Crown-
Prosecutor afterwards
asked the foreman of the
jury. “Faith, didn’t he
have to pay Counsellor
Molesworth 20 guineas to
defend him, and isn t that
enough for any man’s cow ? ”
When last heard from, N.S.W. Attorney-

The readers of the S.M. Herald’s leading
article on the Armenian question the other day
received an electric-shock. For once “ Granny ”
took a decided attitude with regard to a public
question, and came out with a leader strongly con-
demnatory of Salisbury’s policy. It certainly was
not from the pen of any of the usual contributors ;
that is proved by the style, the quality of the
matter, the decided view taken, and the distinctly
Gladstonian bias of the whole—moreover, it con-
tained an apt poetical quotation. Who wrote it
then?
H. C. E. Childers, ex-Victorian pensioner,
on every occasion when he was thrown out of
British Ministerial office, almost on the instant
notified the Vic. Agent-General that “ he desired
again to be pleasantly remembered by Victorians.”
This was his way of suggesting that he was once
more a parasite of the Cabbage-garden. One of
Childers’ claims, valid, but least recognised (his
position in the matter was championed by G. W.
Rusden, the historian, whose advocacy is enough to
damn any cause or any man) was to be the founder
of Melb. University.
Tagli Mahomet, the Afghan merchant
murdered at Coolgardie by a countryman whilst
at prayers, was a wealthy man. He and his
brother, Faiz (who came on to the funeral by
special train from Geraldton), owned about 1200
camels, and land in Bayley-street, Coolgardie, at
Hannan’s, Geraldton and other places. The
Mahomet Brothers did much good for the fields
generally, and were both very popular. At the
grave silver pieces were distributed to the
Europeans, who attended in large numbers.
Thus Rudyard Kipling on “ The Banjo ” :
“ The Travelling Postman ” is new and catching to me,
and I like it; and so do 1 like all the descriptions of
droving and shearing and tramping. I confess I am not
as fond of broken-down gentlemen (who generally deserve
all they get), or miraculous horses and men who can’t be
bricked off under any circumstances. ... I want Mr.
Paterson to write more about the man who is born and
ored in the land, and say what he does, and what he
thinks, and how he manages his affairs “ Till
I drink artesian water” is good, and real, and that is
the kind of thing most folks want to know about. . . .
There can’t be too many men in this world singing about
what they love, and want other people to know and love.

The shores Cornstalkian that we tread,

If the Junction North had the Junction "Body
in its “ full strength,” the shares, instead of going- to
the £, which is predicted, would be dirt cheap at £5.
Not that the loae may not bulge again in the Junction
North ; but the chances are that the property will not
have length enough of it to allow of this. The B.H. lode
is a lenticular vein—“ making ” and narrowing, yielding
in one section the Block 10 kaolin bulge, and in another
the disappointments of the British ; in one section the
wealth of the Junction western development, and in
another the comparative sterility of the B.H. North at its
upper levels.

B.H. Proprietary ceased to use the British Co.’s
furnaces on Jan. 27, after leasing and running them for
three years. This in consequence of the blowing-in of its
own southern nest of furnaces, thrown out of use when
the fire broke out. At one time cheaper work was
possible at the British, but general-manager Stewart has
made several sterling economies about the furnaces.
Apropos which Chief Metallurgist Kohler lately publicly
said (replying to the toast “The Americans,” at a B.H.
banquet) that Mr. Stewart, though not an American, was
the best manager the co. had yet had, by reason of his
extraordinary capacity for mastering detail.

Various parties are at work on the old Solferino
goldfield. The Band of Hope and Lombardy ground
has been taken up by John See and party, and three
men have begun operations in the old workings, with a
view of picking up the continuation of the rich reef which
started the Solferino boom 30 years ago. Over 200 men
manage to get a living in the neighborhood of Solferino.
The wash runs from Jdwt. per man a-day upwards. A
number of the diggers have left Yulgilbar freeholds, but
there are about 50 still at work ; sinking, 5 to Bft.; gold,
flaky and light, with occasional nuggets.
A small party is making tucker on the Cangie
Yulgilbar boundary. At the junction of the Mitchell and
Clarence there are a few men sluicing the sand in the bed
of the Clarence. At first they were getting 2or 3 dwts.
a-day, but it has now toned down. Along the Clarence
men are cradling the sand in the bed of the river. The
yield goes but little above tucker. 30 men are on good
gold, in a small gully running into Nogrigar Creek, the
continuation of Solferino. All the ground taken up and
not expected to last long. The old Tooloom diggers,
forced out for want of water, are all making back again
since the rain. Tooloom is described as “ a flash tucker
field.” The Gov. Geologist reports favorably on the cin-
nabar discovery near Solferino. Assays go up to 65 per
cent., with good, healthy lode.

Tarrawingee Flux and Tram Co. paid during
last half-year 3s. per share (£11,310 18s.), and another
div. of Is. (£3770 65.) was declared at the half-yearly
meeting; £7039 14s. 6d. was carried forward. Of the
profit, £12,000 was on flux. The reserve fund of the co. is
now £22,200, or nearly 6s. per share. Owing to the
drought and the closing of the river a good deal of wool
came down by train that in ordinary seasons would go by
water ; and by this the co. profited during the half-year.
Though, as the directors’ report says, the fire in the B.H.
Proprietary somewhat reduced the flux demanded during
the half-year, yet it is doubtful if a much larger quantity
will be averaged in the future ; apart from the reduction
of smelting by the big mine, the obvious trend is towards
less local furnacing all round ; while the mining co’s are
now keeping their eyes open for all properties from which
they may draw part at least of their own flux supplies.

At next meeting of B.H. Water Supply, Ltd.,
or on the first opportunity, the directors might be asked
whether the water-mains between the head works and the
town show any marked change from their original condi-
tion. Though it is only with difficulty that anything
relating to this co’s affairs can be ascertained, the action of
the water upon the pipes is said to be quite as serious a
matter as the at one time dreaded silting of the reservoir.

look like a div.-payer.

working the old stopes crushed 92 tons for 109 oz. So, if
this crushing is a guide, the old and should-be-worked-out

ground. Why is this thus ? By the way, what was the
reason for so much excitement over the recent election of
managing-director between the supporters of Smith and
Barnfield 7 Smith won.

The Ashcroft sulphide co. has closed for a large
estate at Waratah, Newcastle, where its extensive
works will be erected. The Broken Hill co. has done, or

Newcastle.

Sensational newspaper references are made to
the rich crushings taken from the Dodger claim, Crow
Mountain, N.S.W. The owners have so far averaged 420 z.
to the ton, and they have taken out some thousands of
pounds. Nothing, however, is said as to the length of the
ore-chute, on which the value of all gold-mines depends.
Baker’s Creek, Mitchell’s Creek, and two or three others
in N.S.W. have long ore-chutes ; hence their permanency,
With most other ore-chutes, a 10-head battery would
exhaust a dozen of them in a year.

Rockvale (N.S.W.) Freehold Co. emerges from

She is simply the Phoenix, and has been bought right out
bv a tough party of three-R. Amos. B. G. Watkins, and
George Smith (of Baker’s Creek fame, who takes the
management). The 30-head battery is a nearly new one,
and the new owners get for a song the benefit of the
immense amount of Adelaide money spent m making a
never-failing dam and providing a most complete plant.
Some frue-vanners have been attached, and crushing

been mined a(id broken for the mill. Reef is now 3ft.

is highly mineralised, and it yet remains to be seen if con-
centration is the proper treatment, or whether chlorina-
tibn or cyanide will have to be resorted to.

Coolgardie —“ The Londonderry battery will
now resume crushing its own stone, running full time.
There is plenty of water.” Perhaps ; though that is hard
to believe; but is there plenty of payable stone ? A co.
with a capital of £700,000 crushing other people’s in pre-
ference to its own stone is a grim satire. The Plunder-
derry has been crushing for Burbank’s Birthday Gift,
situated about three miles away; 500 tons produced
nearly 2000 oz. If anything like this average can be kept
up it will be a div.-payer, notwithstanding its ponderous
capital. Burbank, a little man, found it on his birthday.
He was knocked out, fell asleep, dreamt of finding some-
thing rich, and when he awoke he found on an outcrop
some specimens. He thanked Heaven, and, as it was his
birthday, he so named the mine. That’s his own story,
anyhow. Burbank lived to see the mine floated for a big
sum in London, and the other day, in Perth —he got
married.

The Great Boulder jumping-case has been with-
drawn. “ Counsel for the company made strong remarks
against Zollner, the jumper.” Zollner has had his joke,
anyhow. That is the quickest way to amend the law re-
lating to jumping. The curse of Australian mining is
the system giving the whole mine to the successful in-
former. The N.S.W. Mining Conference might consider
this matter.

Mr. Barclay, who has been appointed consult-
ing manager (at a salary of £5OO a year) to the Ernest
Giles W.A. Gold-Prospecting Co., reports from Coolgardie
that “ the prospects of the mine are still favorable, and
he hopes to be able to effect a sale of the property at an
early date.” The manager’s report consists of two para-
graphs. No. 1 shaft has been sunk to a depth of 18ft.
No. 2 shaft 38ft., and a windlass has been fixed. There
are about 20 tons at grass estimated to crush about 2oz.
to the ton. In the equipment of the expedition £1457
10s. 6d. was spent, and of the 10 camels costing £770 five
are dead, and one sold for £37. Salaries and wages on
the field, £607. Office expenses, £590. General expenses,
£712, including £313 for travelling and hotel charges. So
the finding of the Nellie Farren has cost this co. £3776.

Experienced Vic. miner: “To take the W.A.

In a leading article headed “ God send us a
fool-killer,” Coolgardie Mining Review trenchantly deals
with the W.A. Govt, water-supply to the goldfields :
“Premier Forrest might have allowed the experience of
others to be a guide to him. He might have looked at the
dams excavated on some of our mines and he would have
known that they had never held enough water to pay for
the tobacco smoked by the overseer of those works. How
much water has there ever been in the splendid and costly
dams on Bayley’s Reward ? How much will there ever be ?
Dams or tanks are next to useless here. Does he know
that to fill the 7,000,000 gallon dam at Niagara it will take
a rainfall of lin. over 24 miles of country and every drop
will have to be conserved ? The water policy of the
Premier is on a par with the rest of his actions. He knows
well enough that we have no rainfall to make the dams
valuable. If his best effort is a dry dam, then his best
effort is dam bad.”

“Outis,” in Sydney D.T., says that Dr.
Schmeisser made no secret of his conviction that the
world’s gold-supply is going to be very appreciably added
to by the land of the Black Swan. The writer has heard
lots of stories put into Dr. Schmeisser’s mouth by people
interested in the W.A. boom. It will soon be known that
he condemned a vast number of well-advertised W.A.
mines and praised precious few.
“Moses,” in London Truth, referring to the
condemnatory report of Dr. Schmeisser on the Black Flag
mine, says the chairman of the meeting wisely tore it into
shreds as soon as he read it. Reference is then made to
the mining superiority of Mr. J. Gifford, who also reported
on this mine, and whose report, it is assumed, was much
more favorable. Schmeisser is now described as a “ mere
theorist.” In a little while we shall hear the Coolgardie
weaklings howling at the Professor. The question is, did
Gifford know when he reported that the Black Flag was
going to be loaded with a capital of £600,000? As it
happens, he did not.

Premier Forrest —“I hope we shall always be
loyal to the Great Mother Country. (Prolonged cheering
and waving of hands.) I hope that we shall never forget
that the Grand Old Country is the home of our fathers,
and I hope we shall be true to the traditions of our race.”
(More cheering.) The Grand Old Country will realise the
meaning of all this when the W.A. gold-boom is being
cleaned up. No more boom, no more lbyalty. “No
more blanky rum, no more blanky hallelujah.”

The Tasmania, the boss gold-mine of an island
of that name, 4520 tons, 33060 z. Quantity and quality.
“ Bravo ” Jones having failed to sell the mine in London,
the directors have now decided to sink the present work-
ing shaft another 200 ft., and to start a new main and
pumping shaft, to be sunk 1000 ft before opening out.
This mine has a great water difficulty—too much water.
At one time it was thought that the Tamar River was the
source of it. It was mastered after the expenditure of
£50,000 in pumping-gear and after many failures. The
deeper they go the more water, and they are now prepar-
ing in the right way to meet it.

insr-off. Total crushings were 2726 tons for 42060 z.

in her statistical methods long since advocated in The
Bulletin, will make a nominal advance of 40,000 ounces.
All this will tend to make the gross yield for Australasia
of a very cheerful countenance. The yields for the last
two years will compare something like this :

J. J. East, ex-Registrar of S.A. School of Mines,
and now manager of Hannan’s Central, explains the Kal-
goorlie gold formations : There are four occurrences of
gold here, which I classify as follows : 1. Slug gold— i.e,,
nuggets or vein gold. 2. Pepper gold— i.e., very fine
rounded seeds or pellets. 3. Leaf gold-i.e., thin plates
in the partings. 4. Mustard gold—i.e., an amorphous
powder looking like mustard. No. 2 appears to have been
the earliest and No. 4 the latest of the formations, and so
far as present developments have gone this theory fits in
with observed facts. I consider the origin of the gold in
the first place to have been in pyrites which occur in large
nests and bunches in sedimentary rock. Intrusive rocks
tilted the whole up nearly vertically, and then surface
waters percolating down decomposed the pyrites. Capil-
lary attraction returned the water to the surface, carrying
the iron with it and leaving the gold behind as pepper
gold ; subsequently cross Assures occurred into which hot
waters carried true quartz and the slug gold (these
are the ‘ leaders ’). The main lode is poor where
these leaders join. The leaf gold has the same
origin. The mustard gold is at present an obscure
subject, and is usually a shallow occurrence. It will
thus be seen that all the lodes here must be regarded as
contact deposits, and mining in them will be very' erratic
and at times unsatisfactory. The oxidation of iron in the
intrusive rocks also simulates lodes, and has in some cases
caused much disappointment. Especially near the lakes
has disappointment been met with, where the deposits of
swamp ironstone have been mistaken for lode formations
and Aoated into mining companies. From a miner’s
standpoint, the value of a mine is the softness of the
ground and the number of leaders workable. The whole
must be excavated, and the prosperity or otherwise of the
mine is dependent on the average value in gold of the
material raised. There are known to be 24 square miles of
formations as described in this Aeld, and its future is
established, but a dump must come , however, because
anticipations are at present so extravagant.”

Kauri gum—which is unearthed only in two
districts, the M.L. northern peninsula, from Auckland to
Cape Maria Van Diemen ; and Coromandel peninsula,
from Thames to C. Colville—is one of the main causes of
Auckland being the most populous town in M.L. Since it
Arst became a marketable commodity, £8,000,000 worth
has been extracted. The return for ’95 was £412,830,
which is nearly double the value of Auckland’s gold ex-
export, and more than the value of the annual output of
coal for the whole countrv. The average price is £54 per
ton, and most of the fossil goes to New York to be made
into varnish. It is got from swamps and bare ranges,
from which the parent trees have for long ages disap-
peared ; also, among the roots and between the limbs of
living trees—but the latter sort is of an inferior quality.
To the broken man and the ex-prisoner the gumAelds
afford a means of pulling-up and making an independent
living, the tools needed being merely a spear and a
spade. The same industry also often supplies the poor
settler with a welcome Aver.
The Kauri Timber Co.—which holds about
27,000 a. of freehold on the Coromandel Peninsula, bought
from the Maoris for a song in the old free-trade-in-land
days - has sold out to an English co. for half-a-million, of
which £250,000 is to be spent in prospecting and
machinery. On the Whangapona and Mercury Bay
blocks good shows have been found, but the co. demanded
such high royalties that these tracts were practically
unworked. Formerly the land was purchased for the
sake of the timber, and prospectors were warned off on
the plea of danger to the bush from Ares. Now that the
timber is nearly all cut the co. is going in for gold-mining
—with J. Bull’s capital. In various other places mere
speculators hold blocks of auriferous ground which is left
unimproved, but if a prospector Ands anything good on
it the owner is down on him instantlv, and he has to
clear. Since ’7B the Govt, has reserved all mineral rights,
and may resume auriferous land on paying the holder
compensation for the agricultural or pastoral value.

It is found in Maoriland that in the dry-crushing
operations incidental to cyanidation the Ane dust soon dis-
ables many operators. Several Waihi miners have gone
under to this, and others are in hospital at both the
Thames and Auckland.

Near Coolgardie is a mine called “The New

Proposed once more to agitate for the building
of a railway-line from Broken Hill to Menindie, on the
Darling, about 65 miles by an available route. The fall to
the river would be about 500 ft.; but no engineering diffi-
culties whatever stand in the way. This is in lieu of the
Cohar-Wilcannia-Broken Hill line, approved by N.S.W.
Public Works Committee, but scouted by Parliament as
quite impracticable in the present circumstances of the pro-
vince. The line to Menindie, while connecting the mines
and the river, would still serve as a possible section of a
line to Sydney, for it is in the track of the alternative
Lachlan Valley route. Around the Menindie Lakes is
much excellent land (of course requiring irrigation), and
near it good timber, of which Broken Hill is sorely in
need. Of course, Silverton and Tarrawingee tram interests
will oppose.

Latest Northern share trick. B. pawned a big
parcel of 3s. scrip with his banker for an advance a frac-
tion under market rates. Bank notiAed co. that it held
the stock. Few days after a call was made. Banker
refused to pay, mortgagee ditto. B. promptly got the
shares forfeited, and at auction bought his security back
for a few pence. But he gets no more loans from that

The wages of the British miners employed at
Johannesburg were raised from 10s. to 15s. a day during
the crisis, ostensibly to “ protect” the mines.

The well-boring activity of the Westralian
Govt. chieAy means that a number of very, very inAuen-
tial people have bought the local rights for the Calyx
drill, and that they are now Aoating their concession into
a huge company, out of which they draw a pile by way of
a start. Up to date, practical well-borers have little faith
in the artesian possibilities of those arid regions ; it looks
as if either the ocean-water must be brought to the Aelds
or ore taken from the Aeld to the ocean. The latter course
would be by far the cheaper and quicker, but it would in-
volve a railway to Esperance, and, if the Coolgardie Aelds
are going to stay, that railway will have to be built.

Over 1000 persons were on board the steamers

It will be of fearsome interest to several
people just now to learn that the penalty provided
by N.S.W. land law for employing a dummy is
forfeiture of pastoral lease and two years’ im-
prisonment.
South Australian horses knock spots off
the Maoriland animal working in W.A. In the
timber country the S.A. horse sticks to his jinker

Brisbane Courier is trying to arrange a
coalition between Boodlewraith and the Opposi-
tion. M‘II wraith swallowed Nelson: why shouldn’t
Nelson swallow Powers ? The game is too thin,
however, and the Govt.’s political stench is too
great.
The secretary of the N.S.W. Society of
Artists writes, with reference to a recent Bulletin
paragraph in re the proposed withdrawal of the
State vote for art instruction from N.S.W. Art
-Society, that the-Society of Artists as such has
taken no action whatever in the matter: —
Those of its members who took part in the deputation
to the Minister for Education did so in their private
capacity, and not as representatives of this society.
No doubt. The position of the artists who were
on the deputation is that of Dr. Jameson. The
Society of Artists in this matter plays the part of
Rhodes and the Chartered Company. Not that
The Bulletin blames it.
On dit that the reason why N.S.W. Lands
Minister Carruthers did not pay his projected
visit to Norfolk Island was that he wished to
await developments in the big Mercadool land-
case.
To properly appreciate the cable-liar, a
man must read the foreign press. Cape Times of
11th January gravely prints a London wire to the
effect that an anti-German meeting had just
passed off with much enthusiasm in Melb.
Q. Attorney-Gen. Byrnes, returned from
his Honolulu trip, lays stress on the importance of
the Japanese factor in Hawaian politics. Hardy,
intelligent, and 2.>,000 strong, the Japs, now
demand the franchise, and promise eventually to
boss the islands. Byrnes has visions of a New
Japan within a fortnight’s steam of Australia,
and in the direct track of Canadian and American
trade; and he professes to be uneasy at the
neighborhood and its possible results. Yet,
though it is declared that Queensland will not
come into the Japanese treaty, the Q. Govt, has
thrown no obstacle beyond a mild diplomatic re-
monstrance in the way of Jap. sugar-laborers
and pearl-fishers, and it shirks Federation because
Federation means the abolition of colored labor.
“ Whether it is (writes Sydney D.T.’s Lon-
don correspondent) that Sydney air favors the
development of fictional talent or that Sydney
editors are specially perspicuous in discerning pro-
mising beginners, I don’t know ; but quite a dis-
proportionate number of literary Australians
seems to have made their mark first in your
colony. Ernest Favenc and Louis Becke are
recent examples. The latter has achieved a big
hit in England and America this last year.
Magazine editors will take all he can write, and
his two books sell exceedingly well. Mr. Clement
Shorter, of the Illustrated London News, is a
great admirer of Mr. Becke’s work, and this week
the author of ‘By Reef and Palm ’ commences a
serial story in Sir William Ingram’s paper.
He has also a grim tale of revenge called
‘A Boating Party of Two’ in the January
English Illustrated Magazine. Mr. Faveno
has not been quite as fortunate as Mr. Becke.
He fell into the hands of old-fashioned publishers,
who have neither the inclination nor facilities to
push a new man as Unwins and Hutchinsons do.
Nevertheless, all who stumbled across his ‘Tales
of the Austral Tropics’ wexe much struck with
them, and the boys’ book he published through
Blackie obtained good reviews.” Considering
that pretty nearly every Australian daily paper
makes it its business to suppress the fact, it may
be as well to remark that both Becke’s “By Reef
and Palm” and Favenc’s “ Tales of the Austral
Tropics ” were reprints from The Bulletin.
St. Kilda (Melb.) Salvation Army has been
troubled lately with internal dissensions, which
culminated in a free-fight outside the Salvation
barracks, one “ sister ” being badly slapped in
the melee, and a “hrother” severely bitten by
another “ brother.” A scrap of evidence :
Matilda Richardson gave evidence bearing out Mr.
Gaunson’s statement. Witness admitted having slapped
Collis first, when he sneered at her. He had ruined and
deserted her.
Mr. Gaunson : Did you consent to your ruin ?—No ;he
pulled me into the room and locked the door. A meetng
was going on in the barracks. The captain was reading
the Bible. The door in the partition was unlocked.
What was there to prevent you calling out ? —I could
have called out.
Was that the only act of impropriety you allege against
this young man ?—Yes. He had attempted to assault me
before. I know “ Captain ” Freeman. He was in the
habit of giving me a “ kiss of peace,” perhaps twice a
week.
Was this kissing public or private?—Well; he didn’t
kiss me before everybody.
The “ kiss of peace ” has burst-up more religious
movements than almost anything else on record.
When a church gets to the stage at which the
brothers begin to paw the countenances of the
younger and better-looking sisters, it is going
downhill.
One of Melbourne’s wealthiest and least-
obtrusive citizens is appearing just now in the
character of an alcoholic missionary, free from all
appearance of guile. This unique identity is
T. W. Stanford, brother of the late Senator
Leland Stanford, erstwhile Governor of Cali-
fornia. He preaches the gospel of Vina brandy,
on behalf of a noble cause. The late millionaire
Leland Stanford and his wife (still living) built a
University at Palo Alto, California, in memory of
their only son, who died, and gifted an estate of
50,000 acres for maintenance of the same. It is a
solid educational establishment, where “mechani-
cal and other arts, requisite to fit out young
women and men for the business affairs of life, are
theoretically and practically taught, as well as the
higher subjects generally associated with a univer-
sity career.” Already 1000 students, including
300 girls, are domiciled on the premises. They
pay about £1 a week for board and lodging, all
other expenses, amounting to some .£45,000 per
annum, being met by the Endowment Fund. The
Vina Ranche, nestled in the heart of the Sacramento
Valley, 200 miles north of San Francisco, is a
choice estate of 59,000 acres, and of this philan-
thropic territory a vineyard, the largest in the
world, covers six square miles. The rest of the
soil is mainly grazing land for 30,000 sheep and
cattle, whilst alongside the irrigating ditches 30
miles of fruit-trees are dedicated to the advance-
ment of human knowledge. The entire income
from the estate flows into the University Fund.
Leland Stanford’s widow has control of the
business, which, at her decease, will be managed
by trustees. T. W. Stanford, a trustee in
prospective, undertook to introduce Vina brandy
to the Australian public, not from any personal
commercial motive, but for the benefit of the
university that honors the name he bears. It
seems that wine brandy, rather than wine simple,
is the great product of the Sacramento vineyard.
The Government has a bonded warehouse on the
ground, where enormous quantities of spirit are
released, upon payment of duty, and sent along to
New York. As far as genuineness can be guaran-
teed, the Vina (why not call it “University”?)
brandy is above suspicion. The shrewd philan-
thropist who created the industry forbade any
sort of adulteration or misstatement of the liquor’s
age. To preserve the character of this cognac un-
spotted before the world is a duty to the dead.
“ The public may fairly assume,” says brother
T. W. Stanford, in his interesting circular, “ that
the industry is being carried on under auspices,
and for a purpose calculated to give the
utmost confidence that the quality and purity
of the brandy will be honorably maintained,
and, if possible, improved upon.” Without doubt,
the Vina brandy—whether circumstances permit
it to “ catch on ” in Australia or no—is a valuable
subject for local consideration. Its first value, the
present writer fancies, is in the absence of fusel
oils. The Californian cognac has not, thus far,
a quite convincing aroma or flavor, but it displays
the true “feeling” of maturity, and makes the
consumer happy on arriving at its destination.
And the vines that yield this tonic are rooted in
good ground. Even a conscientious teetotaller
might lower a bumper of Vini brandy (and water)
to the health of Sweetness and Light, coupled
with the name of Senator Stanford, deceased.

RABBITS OR SHEEP.
Mr. John Cooke, of frozen meat celebrity, speak-
ing on the rabbit question at the recent wool-
brokers’ dinner at the Australian Club, Melb.,
urged the woolbrokers to provide their travellers
with TOXA, the famous rabbit destroyer, so that
when they were passing through infested country
they might lay baits for the voracious rodent,
This is a good, practical suggestion.*
Eno’s “ Fruit Salt ” (one of Nature’s own pro-
ducts) keeps tire blood pure, and is thus of itself
one of the most valuable means of keeping the
blood free from fevers and blood poisons, liver
complaints, &c., ever discovered. As a means of
preserving health it is unequalled : and it is, more-
over, a pleasant, refreshing and invigorating
beverage. After a patient and careful observation
of its effects when used, I have no hesitation in
stating that if its great value in keeping the body
healthy were universally known, not a single
household in the land would be without it, nor a
single travelling trunk or portmanteau but would
contain it.—J. C. Eno. Sold by all chemists and

The first issue of this paper was printed and published at
107 Castlereagh-street, Sydney. The Bulletin was never
published at Melbourne. On observing The Bulletin’s
success some Melb. people got out a paper called The

and inglorious career, and was finally buried in the
stomach of Melb. Punch, “ with which is incorporated the

«I had a'pair of your boots 16 months ago, and I must

they are still quite good, and will last another six months.”

The New Photography.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Jan. 30.
Much interest has been aroused by a recent remarkable
discovery in photography and its application to medical
science. The medical profession in London is utilising
Routgen’s process of photographing through opaque sub-
stances with astounding results. By means of this pro-
cess it is_ claimed that gallstones, stones in the bladder,
and injuries to bones in the body can easily be seen.
There are certain possibilities the future has in
store
For the photographic snapper with his swift
snap-shot.
With his perky little camera he hopes soon to
explore
The “ innards ” of the citizens he may chance to
spot.
If your liver’s out of order he will photograph the
thing,
At your corrugated stomach he will have his
merry fling ;
He will show a startled public, by his dark and
gruesome fad,
The tracks of all the whisky and the tanglefoot
you’ve had.
You may wear a double overcoat to bar his little
game,
But he’ll photograph you through it and will get
there just the same.
And even if you’re in a house the task will not
appal
The photographic pirate—he can get you through
a wall.
He will picture all the lesions in your liquor-
joggled nerves,
He will show degeneration in your cerebellum’s
curves ;
When your bile is biling over, or your ribs are on
a spree,
He’ll serve ’em up per camera and let the public
see.
Or, if you are a gorger and your teeth their duty
shirk,
The portrait-fiend will show your sweetbread doing
double work.
There is a pleasant vista though, in which the
fancy sports,
Perhaps some day they’ll find a way to photo-
graph our thoughts.
And when they catch ideas in the sources where
they’re lodged,
The Reign of Truth will come at last —because it
can’t be dodged.
The humbugs of all kinds and sorts will see their
saddest day
When once the mind-photographer gets fairly
under way.
No more in court all truth and law the perjurer
will chaff:
They will not ask him then to swear—they’ll take
his photograph.
The parsonry and legalry to dodge the thing will
try
(But journalists will welcome it— they never tell a
lie).
In that day when the light of truth shall glare on
mental smutches,
The best photographer will be the one who best
retouches.
And when men see the mischief that the photo-
graphs will make,
They’ll sadly mourn the happy time when they
were all opaque.
And many a trusty citizen will get his gun and
pot
The photographic pirate with his swift snap-shot.

“Banjo” Paterson, after a spell on and
about the Gulf watershed, has return d to Sydney.
“The Bulletin, of Syd
ney, the most popular journal
under the Southern Cross.”—
Saturday Review (London),
Dec. 28, ’95.
Johns, the wicket-keeper of
the Aus. Eleven, is a fair-haired
athlete 28 years old ; scaling list.
41b. and measuring sft. llJsin. He
is a Melb. native and Melb. solici-
tor ; he takes the present trip
because a man gets only one great
holiday in his life, and Johns’s
turn has come early. When Stod-
dart and his Englishmen were here
they said Johns was the first
Australian wicketkeeper ; and, in-
deed, he did keep wicket against
them very brilliantly. Johns keeps
wicket for University in Mel-
bourne, and altogether he has been
“keeping” for 12 years, six in
junior and six in senior cricket.
He has never received any serious
injury while wicket-keeping—but
has had three knuckles knocked up,
and in Vic. v. N.S.W. last time he
got a thumb disjointed. In that
match, too, he received an injury
which upset him altogether - the
insults and hoots of the Sydney
mob which thought that Iredale
was out stumped instead of caught.
Johns thinks that Trumble is the
hardest bowler to take —for he
bumps them down so. He is not
the least concerned about taking
Eady and Jones —“straight fast
bowling is as easy as any ; I can
take A. E. Troct’s fast ones as
easily as I could wish; they are
just as fast as Eady’s or Jones’s.
The hardest bowler to take would
be Englishman Richardson; you
never know when his fast one is
coming straight on or going to
break back.”
Nathan Herman, of the Misfit Parlor,
9 Wynyard-street, Sydney, publishes in this issue
a few letters from enthusiastic customers testify-
ing to the wonderful value of the famous £2 bale
of clothing and other articles, and sceptical per-
sons who feel inclined to do business are invited
to remove their doubts, in the first place, by in-
specting the originals of these and many other
testimonials at Mr. Herman’s premises. In addi-
tion to the £2 bale of men’s clothing Mr. Herman
now offers for 20s. a parcel containing all material
for three dresses and linings complete ; also several
other 20s. parcels of such magnitude that only the
advt. can do full justice to their contents. The
watob, clock, tobacco, furniture, carpet and lino-
leum, crockery, and other departments are all in
good working order, and everything, from the
7s. fid. watch and chain upwards, is selling at the
same extra ordinarily low prices as heretofore. The
man who u ndertakes to supply suit of clothes, four
shirts, six pairs socks, six handkerchiefs, two
jieckties, two collars, studs ? hat, braces and boots
for 405., and pay freight into the bargain, natur-
ally reckons that he can beat creation at almost
anything.*
SPORTING NOTIONS.
“ Gundagai ” Purves wrote to the Age suggest-
ing the advisableness of selecting the future Australian
Elevens by means of the referendum, and proposing that
two extra men be so selected, each voter sending along Is.
for the man he fancies—all the money so collected to go
to the elect. The idea failed to catch on—shillings are
scarce in Melbourne.
* * * *
Since the early days of Australian elevens, when
a well-known stonewaller was paid a lump sum before an
Australian eleven began its tour, no one else was similarly
treated until a certain Melbourneite asked for, and re-
ceived, a guarantee of £4OO ere he would sign the articles
of the last team. Yet he is now indignant at members of
the ’O6 Eleven wishing to take Lyons on the ground that,
as a big hitter, he would attract gate-money.
* * * *
“ Lightning ” Jones, who has always been
cracked up by his club-mates as a batsman, on Saturday
week against North Adelaide made 87 runs in 50min.
“Jonah” will be far from bottom in the Aus. Eleven
batting-list if he shows his true form in England.
* * * »
Eerris (now a clerk in the Commercial Union
Insurance office, Adelaide) played for Norwood against
Adelaide Feb. 1, and bowled nearly all day, taking two
wickets for 49 run's. He has filled out a little since he
left Australia, and seems to have deteriorated in .bowling
and marvellously improved as a batsman.
* * * *
Melb. Sports Co. displays a photo, of the
lustrous Australian cricket-team of ’B2 for England :
Murdoch, Spoiforth, Black ham, Giffen, Palmer, M‘l>onnell,
Massie, Bonuor, Horan, Bannerman, Boyle, Garrett,
Jones. Giffen has not held out quite so long as Black-
ham, but as the survivor of this lot he should be proud.
* * » «
“Jack” Worrall, playing for Carlton against
Melb. University last week, carried out his bat for 415
runs, an Australian record (as is also Carlton’s innings of
924). Two Saturdays were occupied in compiling the big
score. In 1892 Melbourne scored 82S against Essendon,
and last Saturday E. Melb. knocked up 876 against Rich-
mond, and Melb. scored 633 against St. Kilda.
»—* « *
Worrall went ’Ome in ’BB, but shaped indiffer-
ently. On his record he should have been picked in the
last Vic. team that beat N.S.W. His omission was, in the
light of former and subsequent events, a glaring mistake.
A big number turned up on Saturday to see
Turner bowl on Sydney Domain. Rain came along as his
side was taking the field, and the crowd went home dis-
appointed.
• * * *
Will the Australian Eleven team really play an
eleven picked from those left out? It had better be
careful. Defeat would utterly ruin its ’Ome prospects
financially.
* * » *
Already the Great Australian Thirst is dogging
one of the Australian representative eleven.
« * * •
A Williamstown junior cricketer, “ Yorkey ”
Dyson, took four wickets with four consecutive balls,
playing with the A.N. A. team of his suburb against the
Hamilton branch last Saturday.
* * * *
The much-mashed female who worships the racy
cyclist was more in evidence than ever at the recent
Melb. L.V.W. carnival, some of her even going to the
length of pelting the particular hero with flowers. A
couple of bunches of the gaudy vegetables placed well on
the track would provide material for a thrilling tragedy.
The ground officials should keep an eye on these young
women, and let them restrain their impetuousity until
the evening stroll with the demigod of their fancy.

The statement that Zimmerman means to con-
fine himself henceforth to the making of records is very
amusing. A man who can make records might as well
race against men, as well as against time, whilst he is
about it. But Zim. will break no more watches, anyhow.
* * * *
Small boy MTnnes, said to be only 18 years old,
looks like and rides with the judgment of a veteran
jockey. In the L.V.W. Cup he was an easy second in his
heat, and though the heat was the slowest of the five, yet
he got off his machine with such a 16in.-collar smile that
the writer would not be surprised if in the final he had a
bit up his sleeve.

How much muscle ! how little head ! The
writer heard Parsons say a few days ago—“ Most of us
can sprint one round of the M.C.C. Ground (a quarter of
a mile) at our best, but when Porta starts to go the
second lap from home it tears the bowels out of us.” And
yet in the final of the International Scratch Race (one
mile, run in 2min. 51 2-ssec.) Parsons, who had won his
heat in 2min. 31sec., allowed the first two laps to be a
crawl, and was not amongst the first three.
* » * *
Martin wanted Porta to “ join the party ” for
Maoriland. Porta’s reply was characteristic : “ Porta big
baby—Martin know everytink—me no go, Martin.”
* * * J*t
Scharp, the veteran Vic. cyclist, rode home
a winner of £lOO in L.V.W. Cup last Saturday on a
Melbourne-built machine. Scharp weighs 12st. 71b., and
his mount scaled under 201 b.—a record which it would be
difficult for the foreign firms to surpass.
* * * *
The Bulletin’s prediction that the winner of
the L.V.W. Cup would spring from the four bikists placed
in the fifth heat was quite borne out. One of the
quartette, G. Irish, came to grief in a scrimmage. Two
out of the remaining three, L. B. Scharp and Hill,
finished first and third respectively. A protest by Hill
against Scharp was dismissed.
Another dismissed protest came from Porta,
who fInLL-d a wheel behind M‘Lean for the 10-Mile
Championship race. The Italian complained that M Lean
and Ken. Lewis, the third man, had attempted to bring
him down by wobbling their wheels. In the opinion
good many onlookers, he (often blocked . , ?
journey) was unlucky to get beaten, to sa J’ ) ~ d t
it, and any ardent Victorian who might feel inclinwf to
match M’Lean against Porta over 10 miles would easily
find somebody to put up money for the foreigner.
No particular reason was given for the of
Parsons in last Saturday’s “ Championship race at We id.
Cricket Ground. He rose holding his head, as
badly shaken. The crowd hooted a little. Then Vaisons
re-mounted and came along ahead of one of the fo
men, actually easing off in order to do the paco-niaKit
for him. Moreover, the field seemed anxious to ™e
much-overrated Victorian a good show, and w'hen Poi ta
tried to get away and increase the gap between himself
and Parsons, he (Porta) appeared to get blocked. Put it
was all to no purpose. Parsons was all out and incapable
of improving the opportunity given to him. ProDaDiy ne
was distressed before he fell.

Two ladies in Melb. train. No. 1 : “ Yes, my
dear, I assure you they are a very clever family. No. * ■
“In what way clever? ” No. 1: “ Well, the eldest son is
one of the leading cricketers in Yarraberg, and Will, tne
next one, got a prize at a bicycle-match the other day,
and ” The train stopped here and the listener had
to get out. But what he had heard was enough to show
him that the Australian young man who thinks he will
become the rage amongst Australian young women oy
going into business as a poet, a painter, or piano-pounder,
has come to a goat’s-house to buy wool.
Be it known to all men that Thomas William
Garrett, veteran cricketer of N.S. Wales, is Registrar of
Probates in the said province, and has no connection witn
the Dept. for the Registration of Births, Deaths, and
Marriages.

A London cycle co. is turning out machines
with handles, tubing, and forks of bamboo, and steel
joints. They are light, durable and cheap.
Give the cash-cyclists plenty of rope and they’ll
hang themselves, just as surely as did the over-petted
cronk pedestrians. One utterly evil influence is the Pro-
fessional trainer, whcTbids his man win or lose as he (the
trainer) thinks fit. t
They whisper in Melbourne that the joke of the
O’Halloran-Ohainpion case is an opinion expressed (and
overheard by strangers) by Brewer to “ Carslake Jones,
re the running of Dowry. But, then, uniortunately for
one of the parties to the libel-case, what Brewer allegedly
said to Carslake isn’t evidence.
Champion’s cross-examination of O’Halloran a,t
Melb. City Court seemed very weak, but since it couldn't
make any difference to the result (committal for trial
being a foregone conclusion), Champion wasn't likely to
show his hand —presuming that he has some cards worth
keeping dark.
Yet Champion’s conduct of his case struck
people as fiabh.y, and came as a disappointment. Purves,
who prosecuted, made a most offensive and personal
speech, ca.ling the defendant all sorts of things; but
Champion, who can be sharp-tongued when he chooses,
took it all quietly. To the average man the temptation
to pour salt into one or two of Purves’smany open wounds
would have been irresistible. Champion had better not
be his own lawyer at the higher tribunal. His best
possible move would be to hire David Gaunson, who is
just spoiling for a go at Purves, and let Nature take its
course.
In opening for O’Halloran, Purves said there
was nothing but legal redress for slanderous attacks, and
that physical chastisement was not practicable. Which
unfortunate remark at once recalled the “O’Hara’’in-
cident.

Another jockey has been done to death on

Member Gaunson’s turf-reform proposals were
hopelessly rejected by a V.R.O. special meeting. Not
surprising, seeing that Melb. papers, always anxious for
reform, whooped against Gaunson because he wasn’t an
experienced, practical racing-man. The paid-steward pro-
posal, advocated by all the papers, wasn’t even seconded,
though 100 were present. A conservative club that works
on a minimum expenditure, and ties string on to press
complimentary tickets in. place of the boom-time blue
ribbon, couldn’t be expected to go back on its honorary
stewards and appoint paid officials in their places. Gaun-
son should modify his proposals, and get some special
meetings called to show that Vic. racing is mainly a
swindle and not a sport.

After all, the reputation of a racehorse-owner
for straight-going depends chiefly upon his trainer’s
reputation. If the trainer is a highly-respected trainer,
then no doubt the owner’s horses run honestly. They
wouldn’t be in an honest trainer’s stable if they ran
“cronk.” On the other hand, if a trainer has a fishy
character as a horse-manager, his employer would, rightly
or wrongly, be spoken of as “ fishy ” also. Men are judged
by the company they keep.

The Foliage stable is apparently making no

way in the matter of betting on the V.R.C event

When Auraria was trying to get clear in
straight to make her winning run in Melb Cun I m l
Richmond blocked the way. This horee is Vhe C n?A o t ?rd

might be worth remembering in connection with Aus. Cup.

Running wide in the straight and finishing
right under the judge’s box seems to be a peculiaHn n g f
some horses. If they do it once, they’ll always do f and
the vagary often loses races. Animals de a
course have been known to break for the gate during a
race, so as to get to their stable, but such cases are rare.
Jockev Stevenson’s disqualification for spread-
eagling his fingers at a noisy crowd bothered the owner
of Auraria not a little. The V.A.T.C. refused Mr. James s
reauest to reconsider the matter and set Stevenson free,
so he is casting round for another pilot for the mare in
the Autumn. * * *
Now that proprietary racecourses are springing
up like mushrooms, some one should urge the authorities,
in the interests of humanity, to test the safety of the
tracks. Every week jockey-boys are mangled to make a
gambler’s holiday. » * *
An infatuated public is always ready to back
good cattle, whether they’re under a cloud or not. The
acceptance of 2 to 1 about Auraria for the Champion,
though lame, is a case in point, and shows what Adelaide
folk think of the mare. She pulls up dotty after her
long-distance exercises; but, as owner Jones says it’s
merely soreness, she may see the post after all.
* * * *
Whakawatea hasn’t won a race since his unex-
pected Oakleigh Plate win with 9.13 up, a year ago. A
great weight-carrier, he has only once won with under Bst.
up out of 17 successes. Were he prime he would shake
the Newmarket badly, though Bungebah is the only horse
that has ever got home with his weight, 9.3.
* * * *
The oldest horse in Aus. Cup is the light-
weighted, not-up-to-much nine-year-old Taurus, who has
raced in all sorts of company and has scored 15 times
among those of his own set.
Idolator, third in last year’s Newmarket, has
risen 31b., and Laundress, the winner, 151 b. The chest-
nut, now six years old, has but two races to his credit,
and it's time he brought off something good.
Clever people are keen on the Ballarat double,
Idolator and Elswick. The latter has never travelled a
distance, but there seems no reason why he shouldn’t.
If he can stay a fast 2j miles a big coup will be landed,
according to all accounts.
* * * *
Of the 15 three-year olds left in the New-
market, Challenger, with 8.13, is adjudged the best of the
bunch, according to the handicapper. It’s a big weight
for a youngster in an assorted field of seasoned and light-
weighted sprinters. If Wilson's horse is 101 b. better
than Thunder or Foliage, he must be a good ’un. The first
named, as a two-year old, gave Auraria 231 b. and a beat-
ing. Challenger has a stone less in Oakleigh Plate, and
may spin for that.
* * * *
The best three-year old that ever ran the
V.R.C.’s big dash was undoubtedly Cranbrook, who
carried 8.12, and put up 1.144 record, which still stands.
* * * *
Three-year-olds have won Aus. Cup 10 times in
33 years ; aged horses eight, four-year-olds seven, and
five and six-year-olds four each. This year, the field will
likely be small, but, so far, nine four-year-olds, seven
three-year-olds, four five-year-olds, and four six-year-olds
grace the bill. The only aged horses are Admiral and
Taurus, who may not -tart.
* * * ♦
Tour and five-year-olds appear to be most suc-
cessful in Newmarket Handicap, eight of the former and
nine of the latter having annexed the stake. Three-year-
olds have won on four occasions, and a six-year-old once.
* * * *
Havoc is thought in some quarters to be quite
equal to repeating last year’s performance in Aus. Cup,
though he has a stone more. Malua won with 9.9, but he
was an exceptional horse. Woodman was the only animal
that ever won the event twice.
* * * *
Lists of Melb. Cup and other winners invari-
ably omit the sex of the animals. How is a new-chum to
know whether such as Pearl, Haricot, Wollomai, and
Calamia were colts or fillies? Many lists of handicap
winners forget to state their ages.
* * * *
Of the four best three-year-olds in the Spring—
Auraria, Wallace, Osculator, and Waterfall (written out
of order)—one has been lame, the second has got rheu-
matics, the third has broken down, leaving Waterfall, who
gallops lustily and revels in his work. Oxenham’s colt
may yet prove to be the best handicap horse of the crowd.

If the V.R.C. abolished the assumed-name
regulation as proposed, a number of bankers, &c., who
race contrary to regulations, would have to give up the
little game, or let their trainers assume ownership.

The Sydney police, in closing the tote-shops
about four months ago, would seem to have exhausted
themselves. Several of the shops, which have remained
empty ever since, are now being reopened by their old
proprietors. The tote-keepers know they are carrying on
an illegal business through sheer cheek and bluff ; but
they also know the police are slow in moving, and that
money can be coined meanwhile.

.The handicapping has much to do with the un-
satisfactory nature of the trots at Lady Robinson’s Beach.
Everybody but the handicapper seemed to see that the
marks on which Lady Eva, Regina, and Katie M. were
placed made the races which they won foregone con-
clusions in their favor, and the betting was paralysed
accordingly. Ihe handicapper at Lillie Bridge brought
Greyskin, Rosebud, and DaptoMaid together last Wednes-

One of the pleasantest, coolest, most
central and best-appointed restaurants in Sydney
is the Manhattan Dining Room, ‘situated in the
basement of the great Equitable Building in G eorge-
street, Sydney. It is in the middle of the busiest
portion of Sydney, and is in every respect a high-
class establishment with good cooking, good at-
tendance, a lavish bill of fare, and luxurious
fittings and furnishings.*
Messrs. Hordern Brothers, of Sydney,
have secured the contract for carrying mails be-
tween Sydney, Norfolk Island and Lord Howe
Island during 1896. Their schooner, the Alice
May, will make the round trip every six weeks,
carrying freight and passengers, and the latter
will have a week or a fortnight, as the case may
be, on shore at the end of the trip, consequently
the new arrangement makes these solitary islets
Eossible holiday resorts, which has not previously
een the case. Board and lodging in these lone-
some regions cost only 15s. or £l a-week, and as
the islands are the most peaceful, secluded and
absolutely restful spots within reach of Sydney—
spots where the daily-paper-horror ceases from
troubling, and the canvasser is at rest, and where
the dun and the mother-in-law, and the New
Woman, and the sex-problem drama, and the Salva-
tion band are all shut out—they should be the best
place imaginable for the man whose nerves are
shattered and his constitution run down.*
Scrubb’s Cloudy Ammonia is an article
which serves more good purposes than almost any
other fluid on the market. A few drops will
soften the hardest water; therefore, Scrubb’s
Cloudy Ammonia should invariably be added to
the bath and toilet basin, not alone for its soften-
ing influence, but for the invigorating, beneficial
effect on the skin, producing freshness and
buoyancy in lieu of languor and weariness. If a
couple of tablespoonfuls are added to a hot bath
the effect will be almost as beneficial as a Turkish
bath, while the cost is something under a penny.
In small quantities, Scrubb’s Cloudy Ammonia also
forms a good wash for the hair. Its antiseptic
properties commend it to the sickroom, while as
an ordinary cleanser it is perfect, brightening
plate, jewellery, oilcloth, &c., and saving no end
of trouble in the laundry. It renovates dress
fabrics, and even grease-spots yield to its influence.
Also, it is cheap and has a pleasant fragrance, and
various other advantages.*

At the last sitting of the Land Court at
Darlinghurst, John Moonan appealed against the
appraised value of his conditional purchase, No.
93-26, Burrowa. Mr. James Carroll, land agent,
appeared for the appellant. The land in question
has been part of a special area, and, under the Act
of ’95, the appellant had it re-appraised, when ttie
local board reduced the price from .£3 to £2 10s.,
and part of it to £2 15s. per acre. Mr. Carroll now
argued that the valuation was still too high, and
that it should be reduced to about <£l per acre,
as the appellant found he could not make a
living out of it owing to the inferiority of the soil
and the absence of water. He selected the land
before seeing it. He had expended .£250 on the
farm, and would inevitably continue to lose. The
Court reserved its decision.*

Why?
Why do I have this drowsy, lifeless feeling?
Why does my back ache ; my food cause distress?
Why have I frequent headaches ; and difficulty
to secure rest at night? Why do I lose flesh, or
pass fine sand or gravel ?
Because your blood is filled with uric acid poison,
which must be eradicated before you can regain
health. Your liver is too-weak—run down, ener-
vated and torpid—to properly excrete the bile
which accumulates and poisons the blood, the
system and the kidneys—these great blood-purify-
ing organs are failing to perform their normal
functions. This is “ Why ? ”
Warner’s Safe Cure quickly restores health. It
quickens and invigorates the liver to a healthy
action. Tens of thousands have witnessed to this
fact. Be wise. Frederick the Great said, “ Facts
are Divine things. It is only the foolish who
doubt facts.” Mr. R. Bell, of Brisbane, says :
“ For years I have been suffering from liver com-
plaint and its consequences, which I may say has
almost entirely disappeared after a course of treat-
ment with Warner’s Safe Cure and Safe Pills. In
my opinion, anyone who gives it a fair trial will
find relief when suffering from any form of kidney
or liver complaint.”*
Pinaud’s Sapho Soap may fairly be set
down as the crowning effort of this great and
world-famous perfumery firm. Pinaud’s firm has
been in the business for many years, and what it
doesn’t know about toilet luxuries can hardly be
worth mentioning ; and as the Sapho Soap is the
latest result of its long experience and study—is,
to some extent, the fulfilment of its destiny—the
good qualities of that article may be safely reckoned
as beyond all question. Pinaud’s perfumes are
already familiar all over Australia, and their ex-
cellence is too well-known to require mentioning.*

A 1 in the salle-d’iscrime. He had to take his turn of
military service, but it was soon seen that he was physi-
cally unfitted for a soldier’s life. He got leave of absence
on the ground of sickness, and immediately the Radical
papers declared he had bribed the surgeons who gave the
certificate. Each time he got a short spell of leave
attacks were made on his commanding-officer for granting
it. All the while he was surely dying of consumption,
and eventually, when symptoms of typhoid unmistake-
abiy showed themselves, he was taken to a miserable, so-
called military hospital, where he breathed his last. In
any civilised country but France he would tune at once
obtained his discharge from the army —as indeed he
would, even there, had he been a poor man—but because
he was very wealthy tan unpardonable offence), and as
such a butt for the radical press, the military authorities
were pusillanimous enough to shut their ears to the
claims of humanitv.

The recently-issued annual report of the N.S- W.
Police Department allu les to the powerlessness of the
law to cope with the Sunday-selling publican and the
tote-promoter, but omits to state that some of the most
successful practitioners in these lines are ex-policemen.
For instance, an ex-“cop” lately had to shut up his tote-
shop, but carries on operations all the same in a city
lane. The crowd became so troublesome that he soon
employed a bruiser to keep them. It would never
do to call in the aid of the police and the d’s. It
was quite sufficient if they saw and heard not. But the
tote-man has applied for permission to swear the bruiser
in as a special constable—presumably to “stoush” dis-
satisfied tote-patrons.

Corbett’s real reason for not desiring to meet
Fitzsimmons is now known. He had good reason for
quitting the ring, being physically unable to stand train-
ing. His friends assert that if he re-entered the arena,
any first-class heavy-weight would make a mark of him
after the first few rounds. His mode of living—well,
Corbett is now a Has-been. All ring champions go the
one way.

Some turfmen assert that, from an owner’s
standpoint, bookies are better than the tote. Yet Gollan,
O’Brien, and other Maorilanders have tried Australia and
returned convinced to their old home. Experience favors
the mechanical system of gambling.
A Vic. sporting writer, in conversation with a
well-to-do casual acquaintance once, was asked the tip for
a certain race. “ Oh, So-and-so can win, but is being kept
for the handicap, run in a fortnight. I got it from
the stable.” “Indeed! Well, that’s worth knowing,
anyhow.” But the horse won that day, and the scribe
averred that they were a cunning crowd, and must have
changed their minds. At every subsequent meeting
when that particular neddy was running the scribe’s
friend asked for the tip and got it, and it wasn’t until six
months afterwards that the pressman accidentally dis-

The number of women-backers is a feature of
the irrepressible Australian gambling mania. They send
along their money to the silver bookies, back their pretty
fancies like seasoned punters, and dread “ a bad day ” as
they do the weekly wash.

Jockey John Watts will retire from business, it
Is said, after he has fulfilled next season’s engagement to
royal “ Wales,” who stands a reasonable chance of
winning the Derby. Watts has enjoyed a good long
innings, and will come out of it with a lot of money and
a pretty strong constitution. He was a heavy-weight (as
jockeys go) from the first. About 20 years ago Lord
Dupplin, in the hands of the Jews, was somehow or other
unable to start his horse Petrarch for the Two Thousand
Guineas in a style worthy of the ’orse. Petrarch, instead
of being a warm first favorite, started at an outside price,
and a well-grown stable-boy, instead of a crack jock, had
the mount. Petrarch was considered a dead ’un. How-
ever, the stable-boy brought him home an easy winner,
establishing himself as a first-class rider in one act. Watts
was the boy.

In 1895, 3087 horses ran in England for prize-
money aggregating £487,888 Is. Bd.

At Trentham, Vic. the other day, a party of
three shot 300 rabbits, a hare, a fox, and a big black snake
in three hours
* * * *
A one-time Vic. editor, whose horse-reporter
was away “ on his own,” found that tips were required for
some forthcoming races, and, knowing nothing about the
game, drew the names out of a hat, assisted by the office-
devil. Three came off, and the boss was delighted.
Subsequently, when more races were on, and the horse-
reporter was again away, the editor decided to repeat
the process; but this time the devil went back on his
chief. The imp cut a list of runners out of an old paper,
and the' boss next day confidently tipped three that were
never entered, two that had been dead six months, and
one outlawed for life a year previously.
* * * *
Up North, the other day, a man owned the only
two starters in a race. He was clever, and told the
favorite's rider to run off the track. He did so, but
the other horse ran off too, and an uproar followed the
palpable- swindle. The neddies turned back, and the
favorite had to win. The owner was glad to get off the
course with his skin —and the stake. But the stewards
were clever also. They declared the race void, and dis-
qualified owner, jockeys, horses, saddles, everything.

“Delaware,” of Sydney Truth, doesn’t think
much of the Musket strain. “We read,” he says, “about
the glorious Musket blood, but we are not likely to hear
of the hundreds of rotten-legged Muskets that are
manuring Maoriland. Brutes with big, ungainly bodies
too big for their weak, soft pasterns to support. Musket
got a few good horses, but he got them out of the
grandest lot of mares it was possible to get together.
With the exception of Carbine, all his good horses came
from proved good Australian stock. His sons who have
so far been successful at the stud came from hardy old
stock whose ancestors made the Australian horse famous
for its stamina. Instead of improving I hold that the
Musket has weakened them by introducing bad feet,
weak, soft pasterns, and a general softness all round.
Who ever heard of a good (bar Carbine) Musket after he
was three years old ? Trenton raced on a bit, but he was
all to.pieces at four years. The time will come when the
Muskets Will be dubbed rotten instead of incompaiable.
The most remarkable feature about Musket was his
potency, his ability to get twins and bad-legged, tender
horses. Among all the beautiful, high-priced English
mares imported by the Stud Co., he got nothing really
first-class except Carbine, who takes after his mother’s
family. Carbine’s grand-dam, Clemence, is by Newmin-
ster from Imperieuse’s dam Eulogy, a daughter of Martha
Lynn, the dam of Voltigeur. Such a bred mare ought to
throw a racehorse to a Berkshire boar. Locket, Pulchra,
Pearl Ash, Madcap, Sweet Cicely, Miss Laura, Rangi,
Petroleuse and Atlantis, all produced foals to Musket, but
I doubt if one of the said foals eould win a pony-race
nowadays, especially if Bulleraria was in the field. All
the above mares were selected regardless of cost, their
tabulated pedigrees make one’s mouth water, yet the
‘ incomparable ’ Musket couldn’t knock a real good horse
out of the lot; but other stallions could when they got the
chance. Musket’s fame rests solely on Carbine and his sons
and daughters whose dams descended from Yattendon or
Fisherman, or Yattendon’s sire, Sir Hercules, and hardy
old Tradueer. The latter has done far more good for the
M.L. thoroughbred than ever Musket did. He laid the
foundation of a hardy, sound breed, but unfortunately
Musket came along and poisoned it. Manton was once
thought to be better than Carbine. He is out of a
Tradueer mare, named Gitana, who was by Sir Hercules.
Raupo, a grand-daughter of Sir Hercules, could throw a
horse like Mata to Dead Shot, but I never heard of her
producing a winner to Musket in the three seasons she
visited him. Atalanta threw winners to all sorts of sires,
except Musket; and Atlantis threw King Ban, Happy-Go-
Lucky, Pride of the Ocean, Henry 11., Bower of Bliss, and
St. Leger to different sires, but her three visits to Musket
only produced Happy Land, who would never have been
heard of had she not been mated with stout Ingomar, and
produced Hova.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
did for the Invalid Daughter of a Prom-
inent Lowell Tradesman.
“My daughter had for a long time been
troubled with violent headaches and sleep-
lessness. She was pale, had no appetite,
and was losing flesh rapidly. She took
various remedies for her trouble, but re-
ceived no benefit until she commenced using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. After taking half a
bottle, she began to feel better. By a con-
tinued use of this medicine, her appetite re-
turned, her cheeks began to fill out and show
color, she gained in strength, her headaches
disappeared, she slept better, and now says
she feels like a new person.”_F. P. Cogges-

Mrs. Andrews, the handsome little Mel-
bourne lady who has constituted herself champion
of the Old Woman as contrasted with the New,
declares : “ Women defame their own sex from
motives of jealousy, man defames women from no
motive whatever.” Wrong again. Men defame
women from motives of vanity.
Mow Sang, of Melbourne, was tendered a
bogus £5-note by a visitor to his “store,’’and, being
doubtful of its genuineness, asked the customer to
wait whilst he went “to see.” The heathen went
to see a policeman, who came back with him and
arrested the note-holder. The note-holder (re-
manded for a week pending enquiries) states that
he received the worthless thing in good faith from
a bookmaker, and offered it to the Chow in pay-
ment for “ a lottery ticket, which he had taken out
and marked.” Interesting to see if anything
“ legal ” will happen to the alert Mow Sang.
Melb. Cyclist : Riding from Violet Town
to Melbourne the other day I encountered 20
“ travellers,” of whom two were women, and one
of these barefooted. The latter told me she was
going to Sydney ! She had just arrived in Mel-
bourne from Ballarat, and was looking for work
when she was arrested “under the vag,” and let
off conditionally on leaving the city at once.
What she will do on reaching Sydney is not
known ; probably the magistrate will give her 12
hours to start back to Melbourne—and so on ad
infinitum. The swaggy is the only true profes-
sional pedestrian. He lives by walking and
nothing else.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Dear Bulletin, —A stupid criticism of the
Australian Girl was published a while ago in the
Sketch, a London journal mainly occupied just
now by full-page portraits of third-rate actresses —
the first and second-class ditto having been pic-
torially played out—and untruthful puffy para-
graphs relating thereto. Comment on any subject
emanating from the illustrated jam-factory in
question is not worth making, perhaps. But
since this particular article has been reprinted
in one or more Australian newspapers, at the
instance, no doubt, of some local simpleton who
sent it ’Ome, a protest seems permissible. Here,
then, are a few selections from the Sketch’s
inaccurate summing up of the Australian girl
It is in the exquisite contour of her figure, in the small-
ness of her hands and feet, and in the perfect moulding of
her features that the daughter of the Sunny South is able
to hold her own. . . . The innate shyness of the
English girl has no place in her temperament, nor does
she pay much regard to the culture, the self-contained
dignity, the gracefulness which sit so easily—[As though
gracefulness could sit uneasily!]—on the girls of
the West. . . . To her, art, literature, drama, and
politics are unexplored regions. Dress is the dominant
note of her character. ... In her domestic qualifica-
tions she is unapproachable. Hard-working, industrious,
economical, capable with her needle, good-tempered, and,
above all, generous, the Australian girl makes an ideal
wife. . . . The life of the average Australian girl
seems to he made up of around of social functions—balls,
“ at homes,” parties.
These statements the two last should be
bracketed together for their absurd inconsistency
—are apparently the work of an English-born new
chum, resident in Melbourne, regarding himself
as an irresistible devil among the women, for he
says in the course of his judgment—
In her affections, she dearly loves an Englishman. She
doesn’t stop to enquire about his character ; if he comes
from the old land, he has the key to her heart.
The critic’s Melbourne localism is suggested by
his reference to dress ag the dominant note of
Australian girl-character, and his nationality
obtrudes itself without apology. The Australian
firl, as I find her, is very apt to be Scotch, or
rish, or Jewish, rather than English at heart, in
either of which cases her lack of ‘ * innate shy-
ness ” is not attributable to her Australian
education. Her disposition to extravagance in
dress, as compared with her “ English ” sisters,
is not strongly marked outside of Melbourne.
“The exquisite contour of her figure” is falling
below the British standard for girls in easy cir-
cumstances, and the average London milliner
(how she makes Max O’Rell’s mouth water !) is a
more trimly and comely-built creature than her
Australian-born cousin, who begins to look rather
narrow at the shoulders and hips. Art, litera-
ture, drama, and politics are more explored by the
ordinary Australian girl than by the same class of
damsel at Home. She reads the news of the day
more persistently, she has more ambition to sing,
play the piano, or paint; in fact she is more
artistic. If she doesn’t read as soberly it is
because she hasn’t any long British winter
evenings to while away. Her chief domestic
qualification is her vivacity. As the childless wife
of a man who doesn’t lay too much stress upon his
meals the Australian girl is a treasure. But she is
neither hard-working, industrious, economical
(except in the way of not putting much to eat
before her friends), nor capable with her needle—
not as a rule.— Northerner.

Two small farmers at Wangaratta (Vic.)
broke up a long friendship recently through a
fowl getting over a fence and some other small
matters, and went to law. The first man claimed
,£lOO damages for trespass by the second man’s
horse and cow, and the second man claimed £ 100
for damages done by the first man to some wattles
and gum-trees. Each was full of the old illusion
that when you win a law-suit you come away with
a lot of damages in a bag, while the other man
pays everything, and so thejr went at the matter
gaily with two firms of solicitors, three barristers,
and'an immense quantity of blue paper. When
the case got fairly started after much preliminary
legal expens 3, it boomed along all day and most
of the next day, by which time the lawyers
evidently felt that they had about used up both
agriculturists in costs. So one of them suggested
that apparently the damage done was about equal,
and amounted to something like 40s. on each side,
and nothing was likely to come of it except
an order that each man should pay his own costs,
and he proposed that plaintiff and defendant
should drink beer together at the adjacent pub.
and talk things over. They did so, and agreed to
pay the costs between them, and say no more
about the cow. Then they went home to put in four
years’ extra hard work to cover the expense of two
days’ law, and peace supervened once more.

In one case, when three hunters and trappers
were travelling about the ranges near my place on
the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”

To Herr Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —i hereby beg to certify that having been-
a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to

so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with whioh
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A.. ]VC A R K S,
HAIRDRESSER,
19 Hunter Street, City,
Wishes to intimate to his numerous customers
'hat. in addition to the above, he has just started
a Hi^h-class CIGAR and TOBACCONIST
STORE, next Empire Hotel, llunter-sLreet.
There is an extraordinary similarity between
the face of old Francis Longmore, M.L.A., the Vic.
squatter-baiting radical, and the portraits of
lhomas Paine, the author of the Rights of
Man, about whom much is being said in London
just now apropos of an exhibition of relics. It
may be that Longmore is a re-incarnated and
christianised Tom Paine, for the old man is very
pious. In both men the sharp jaw, prominent
nose and deep eyes are the predominant character-
istics. I heir intellectual bent is also comparable :
though Longmore would never have intervened
to save the lives of aristocrats, as Paine did.
Pum em ! ” Longmore would have said.
Robert Howard (“Nosey Bob ”), the N.S.
Wales Govt, man-butcher, was previously a cab-
K'fT’ ® n d became official strangler because,
though he was always neat and clean and pro-
prietor of a good turn-out,” ladies didn’t like being
driven by a noseless man. Howard, who is now
well over 60 years of age, lost his proboscis through
an accident, nature unspecified. “Nosey,” who
has hanged about 80 persons (he “has never
reckoned the total ”), in 20 years has made as
many corpses as would reach to the top of Sydney
Post-office tower and half-way down the other
+ e ‘j.' , ? ls has very long arms and sub-
stantial feet, and as, strap-in-hand, he presents
himself m the cell to tie up and un-iron the
cowering victim who has never seen him before,
ne must look like the most hideous fiend in all
lophet arrived in his capacity as drummer for the
Devil to grab the soul of the condemned—for there
surely can be on earth no more blood-icing sight
than that of the big, brawny, noseless man-choker
who has come for you.” The whole world
shudders at the noseless—it has been reserved for
the fiendish ingenuity of Botany Bay justice to
make the condemned’s last glimpse of earth a
view, as it were, of the chief janitor of Gehenna.
Une evening a year or two ago, in an Australian
theatre, while the lights were up between the acts,
on a vice-regal command night, and people were
taking and looking round, a tall, large, fashion-
ably-dressed young man came in and stood for
haif-a-minute at the top of the dress-circle’s centre
aisle, the most conspicuous place in the house.
His sinister presence was accentuated by his size
and by the obviousness with which his monstrous
deformity preyed upon his mind, for, as a hush
fell upon the crowded assemblage, and all eyes
were fixed upon him, the poor human chimpanzee
passed his open right hand over the spot where
hl u . nose . should have been as if to feel
whether it was not all a horrid nightmare—
whether a new nose had not begun to sprout. In
a recent interview a Sunday Times man says that
hangman Howard “ lacks nasal adornment, but
you very soon get used to that as you talk to the
quiet, kindly owner.” The spider’s flies, how-
ever, don t get more than three minutes to get
used to him. When Botany Bay appoints anew man-
choker, it might be decent enough to pick one
whose appearance appeals less luridly to those of
the dying who believe in Hell, and so on. “ Nosey ”
hangs his prey with 3in. manilla, and doesn’t go
in a bullying, bouncing way, but performs his
task as kindly and tenderly as circumstances will
permit. “What sense is there,” he asks, “in
being harsh with the poor unfortunates ? A young
man as an assistant is no good ; he may boast about
his nerve, but unless he has had some experience
of life ’’—Nosey, of course, meant Death—“ or has
naturally a strong nerve, he fails at the critical
moment.” The hangman lives by the sea, at
Bondi—which should put up Bondi allotments by
at least £2 per foot as long as he stays there—and
has a flow T er-garden of which he is proud. The
Bulletin remembers that when it interviewed
him, years ago, he said : “ Next time you come
bring the missus, and I’ll give her a nice bokay.”

A Tree that Grew Awry.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long ago, in the dark dawn of our history,
a man and woman met and married in Sydney
settlement. They had been convicts, but specious
liberty, in the shape of a ticket-of-leave, was
granted them on their union. They built a little
shanty on the Western road, just outside the
settlement, and there they made a home.
A few months after there began in them a moral
revolution. Perhaps it was due to some far-ott
Puritan forbears, with white blood and starved
desires, that these people suddenly recognised
that life for them was a foul and loathly thing.
A twelvemonth afterward a girl-child was born.
On the night of its birth, the father came to
the mother, some seeds in his hand.
“Wife,” he said, “these are from the crooked
gum-tree on the hill. Shall I plant them as we
agreed ? ”
“ Plant them,” she answered, “ I will abide.”
He kissed the mother and the child, and took a
spade and went away. Where the soil was soft
he dug a hole, put in the seeds and covered them
up. Then he came back.
“Wife,” he said, “ it is done. I have given
them a fairer chance than the parent, and as the
tree grows we will do.”
The wife said nothing, but clasped her hands
across her eyes, and perhaps prayed.
This man and woman were said to be half-
witted. It was held that a long life of crime had
sapped their reason. They were called the ‘ ‘ Crazy
Couple.” And yet some there have been of whom
the same was said who saw great truths and
gathered them for their maligners.
A year after, the seeds had sent up a sprig to
the height of a foot, and the girl could just walk.
She was a pale little creature with a few pearls
under her lips.
Every evening the parents took her hands and
led her to the young tree. There they would
stand, with beating hearts and bowed heads,
watching it for an hour at a time. Sometimes
they smiled and were happy, but once the wife
drew a curved line in the air with her finger, and
went away weeping.
Up and down the road in front of the house
went a good deal of traffic. Once the Governor
rode by, in his naval uniform and cocked hat, and
with a sword at his side. By him rode his lady,
and the man, the woman, and the child came to
the door and looked at her. She was a pale,
sweet being, and had done many good deeds.
“ If the tree grows straight! ” said the woman,
and sighed.
Another time, as they stood outside, they heard
shouts and songs, and up the long road came a
party of cursing men and a drunken woman. The
husband and wife looked at the woman, but let
the men pass unnoticed. She was a grand crea-
ture, rich with spoilt beauty, delirious and song-
ful. As she passed, she turned and laughed at
the couple for a curious pair, and went round a
bend in the road with her arm about a convict’s
neck.
“ Wife, if it should grow crooked ? ” said the
husband.
* * * *
Three years passed, and the youngster had
grown a strange child. Children of four are
usually full of prattle. She was silent. Those
who met her described her as uncanny. It seemed
as though she knew that Fate, in the semblance
of Nature, was shaping her destiny. She had an
old soul in a'young body, they said. Perhaps
they were right. Children of this description are
rare. They are beings of the twilight, and live in
a grey world. When they cry it is as if an old
anguish deepens their sobs. When they smile a
wintry white gleam shines from a distance. Yet
it may be the child’s unchildishness was due to her
environment. On one side was the great grey
forest where the shadows moved with the sun, and
the silent ants crept to and fro in long files. On
the other was the bloated human world, scarred
with crime and malice, with which she must not
mix. How should the young life shape between
these ?
At length came a day in the summer when the
husband said to the wife —“ The young tree grows
awry. ”
The wife answered, “ Nay, it is no time to
judge. Let it strengthen—it may grow straight.”
But the man replied : “Put on your cloak and
come. There is something I would show you.”
Then they walked through the gum-trees, the
child between them. As they neared the settle-
ment others joined them. The man, the woman,
and the child were very silent; but of those that
joined them many danced and more sang.
They looked so merry as they journeyed on that
the woman, turning to her husband, asked what
festival was being celebrated.
“Wait and see,” replied the man, and said no
more. But a convict, hearing the woman, shouted,
“A festival, aye a festival, and Old Merriment
dances her last dance.”
The man and woman, slackening their pace,
endeavoured to draw apart from the crowd. But
a brazen woman with thick blue lips came and
kissed the ex-convict’s wife and held rum to her
mouth. She thrust the creature aside and spat in
the dust.
“Hush!’’she said, covering the child’s ears
with her hands, “for the little one’s sake be
quiet! ”
When the woman had gone the husband and
wife looked into each other’s eyes, and a heaviness
was there.
“ Husband, it is an ill world.”
‘ ‘ Aye, wife, and shame to keep it going. ”
Towards noon they came to a camp crowded
with soldiers and convicts. On a scaffold stood a
big woman with yellow hair and round, red lips.
It was the same, that some time before had passed
the ex-convict’s home.
“Who is that ? ” said the ex-convict. (And to
his wife, “ Listen.”)
“The Wife of the Regiment,” answered a
soldier.
“ Old Merriment, we call her,” added a convict.
“Hold your tongue, Swiper, or I’ll slice it,”
said the soldier.
“Why do they hang her?” asked the ex-convict.
The convict made a coarse joke and ducked his
head to avoid the soldier’s musket. But the mili-
tary man laughed, nevertheless, and called the
convict “a damned scurvy nag.” Everyone
seemed happy except the man, the woman and the
child.
“ She struck the sergeant with his bayonet.”
And now all eyes were turned on the grand
animal standing on the scaffold and the pale
chaplain beside her. As they fixed the rope
about her neck, the chaplain whispered in her ear.
She paid no heed to his words, but threw back her
golden head, swept the crowd with her large eyes,
and sang a song of the “ Currency Lass.” In this
wise they shoved her off the scaffold. They did
things rudely in those days. But they do the
same things now. It is only in the polish they
have added that the difference lies.
When the crowd had broken up and gone the
husband said :
“ She was once a girl.”
“ And perhaps innocent,” said the wife.
“ Nay, never that.”
“ Who knows ? ” the wife answered—“ some are
born white.”
“Yet, whether or no, it is better she hangs
there,” replied the husband.
“ Had fairer things happened, husband, she
might have been a good woman. ”
“They did not,” said the man; “but instead
the wind hailed always from the one quarter, and
blew the tree awry.”
Then they looked at the child, and a chill
blackness swam before them. The woman clenched
her hands.
A strong nor’-easter blew, and the sky was
marbled with a stretch of cloud. They turned
about and faced homeward.
That night, as they sat by the open door, the
man and woman talked.
“ Wife, are you satisfied ?”
“ Is there no escape ? ” she asked.
“None.”
“ No God ? ”
“ Nay, I do not know,” said the man, “ I have
never seen Him, nor felt His hand.”
The sky had grown black as ink. One level
leaden cloud roofed the earth. As they paused,
staring at each other through the dark, they felt
the nor’-east wind was dying. It was soughing
like a lost wind with a low, dreadful plaining that
hinted of unquiet waters and dead men on frothy
seas.
The man rose.
“ Wife, cursed be the hour that made the thing
necessary ! ”
“ Husband,” the woman answered, “ we were
thoughtless. ”
“ It is no crime we do, they cannot call it crime.
The crime would be in not doing it.”
“ Husband, perhaps we are wrong.”
But the husband took two steps towards the
little room where the child slept.
“ Wife,” he said, “shall I ? ”
“ I love her,” the woman answered.
“ And I,” said the husband, “ else there would
be no need for this.”
The wind was dead now, and no leaf stirred.
The man and woman heard their own breathing,
and it was quick and loud.
Again the husband said :
“ Wife, shall I ? ”
The wife answered :
“ She is young and pretty.”
“Remember the Wife of the Regiment,” said
the man.
“ Do it,” said the woman shortly.
* * * *
An hour later they came to the settlement.
“We have killed our child,” they said.
“Why? ” asked an officer.
“ Because a tree grew crooked.”

patch of the unemployed to “ thin forests ” on the
Murrumbidgee. The men worked on the butty-
gang system, and were not educated up to it, each
individual being frightened to do more than his
share. Much valuable time was lost in arguing
the question of equity. Fifty per cent, of the
members of many gangs bad never been in the
bush before, being mostly bootmakers, building-
laborers, smallgoods-men, ex-breadcart-drivers, and
clerks. Except the clerks, these men were a curse
to the gangs they belonged to—always growling
and whining ; they didn’t know how to use an
axe, and wouldn’t be shown. Any rat of a man
can, if he uses his axe properly, bring a three or
four-inch pine sapling down with two or three
cuts, but these fellows had to make five and seven
cuts. The gang said to have made most money
only cleared 15s. 2d. per week per man, after pay-
ing for railway fares, food, and tools ; had they
worked properly, they could have made nearer
255. The Lands Dept, intended that the men
should earn 7s. per day, but, at the prices fixed,
none save expert bushmen (in many cases, not
even they) could have done it.— Hermes.

At the Wheel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was sick of Wellington and hard luck, so he
shipped on the old Celestia for the run to Dunedin.
He would go rabbiting in Central Otago, or gold-
washing on the river beaches. All he had was the
clothes he stood in, and his blankets; but he
knew it was only a three days’ run with decent
weather.
The Celestia slid out through the Heads on a
mild winter evening, but in the Straits she struck
a wet sou’-wester, and had to thrash against
lumpy seas and savage squalls. He was wet to
the skin from the first hour on board, and things
were bad all round. The cook, in a drunken fit,
threw all the fresh meat overboard, swearing that
it was poisoned. The two casks of salt-horse,
kept for such an emergency, were found to be
putrid. His watch-mate Bill was a born loafer,
the mate was as sullen as a Norseman can be, and
the skipper was in a state of bitter exasperation.
It was “bout ship and bout ship” continually,
and the rain drove with every squall.
He was not dry even in his bunk, for the
fo’castle head leaked like a sieve, and dirty water
dropped on his face while he slept; and when he
awoke it was to jump into wet clothes and to go
out to labor in wind and rain. He cursed some-
times in the night-watch, but he was not an
ordinary growler, and Chantler, the only fellow
he chummed with on board, had to swear for him
occasionally.
Under the seaward Kaikouras the clouds broke,
and they saw giant mountains rising blackly from
the water to dazzling heights of snow. The
vessel rolled about there through a dead calm
winter’s day, but towards night a North-east wind
sprang up, and with it came a cold sea drizzle.
With the wind on the quarter and all sails set
the Celestia drove southward —past the Amuri
Bluff, past Banks Peninsula, down by the Ninety-
mile Beach. The old craft, coal-laden and water-
sodden, went stiffly before the wet breeze. The
patched sails were set like carved boards, the
grimy shrouds and stays were white with the
clinging mists, and as she rolled over the black
sea her hungry crew blessed her as if she were a
clipper.
The wind fell light, the mists were split with
sunshine, and through these splits the glaciers of
the Southern Alps were seen, and further south
the green downs about Oamaru and the white
stone houses of that tax-bound city.
He and the mate were taking a pull on the
maintopsail halliards : they had the handy billy-
tackle on the fall of the halliards, when ‘ ‘ crack ! ”
and the big four-sheave block whizzed past him
and a fathom of rusty chain grazed his head and
knocked him senseless to the deck, the chain
cutting a gap from the bone of his temple to the
nape of las neck. The mate washed the wound
with salt water, cut off a furrow of hairs, and he
went to work again, but slept in his cap that night
for fear the fluff off his blanket should get into the
wound.
The three days’ voyage had extended to a week
when Bill the loafer saw the loom of Port Chalmers
Heads and swore he would have a drink ashore
that night; but almost as he spoke there arose
before them over land and sea a dome-shaped
cloud, black-green, fringed with white streamers ;
and a gale from the Antarctic smote the vessel.
Savage captain, sullen mate, loafer Bill, drunken
cook, and Scotty worked like devils to get in the
sails. lie was at the wheel, and smiled with the
wrong side of his mouth as he saw the entrance
of the harbour close behind a wall of rushing rain
and foam.
The two staysails blew away, the mainsail and
foresail were split to rags before they could be
clewed up; only the topsails held good. They
lowered the main topsail, but before they could
lower the fore it split with a great noise and rib-
boned out to sea.
All hands went up to reef the main topsail,
loafer Bill leading; and the skipper following
hard. He at the helm watched them lay out on
the yard and struggle with the stiff, wet canvas.
To enable them to manage this sail he must steer
up into the wind, so that the canvas flapped
loosely. He shifted the wheel a spoke or two,
holding his eyes open against the driving wind,
when to his horror he saw that the lee braces were
loose, and that a single inch too much in steering
would bring the wind abaft the sail and send the
yard back with a shock that would hurl his mates
into the sea.
The captain, with his yellow beard blown over
his mouth, looked downward, shouted a useless
oath, and motioned the order “Bring her up in
the wind ! ” but the steerer, knowing what such an
order meant, shook his head and pointed to the
braces. The captain heeded him not, for at that
moment a fearful squall with hailstones big as
marbles burst on the ship. He who steered must
hold up his face to this and keep his eyes open to
see that even in that mad rolling and rushing,
that mad dash of wind and ice, he steered just in
the teeth of the wind and no more.
The squall tore off his cap and left the gaping
new wound open to the stinging hail and spray.
Hailstones smote to the depths of the rawest cuts
—struck eyes and cheeks agonising blows ; still he
looked up, for he must steer by the wind.
With a delicate reel of the helm he brought the
sail so near the direction of the wind that the men
were able to haul it on the yard and reef it; and
then they hurried down on deck, the skipper lead-
ing this time. He came on the poop with a gleam
of fury in his china-blue eyes. “ Damn you !” he
said, “ why could you not keep her shaking, you
skulking ? ”
“ The lee-braces weren’t fast,” was the answer—
“an inch too much helm and you and the rest
would have gone to blazes. ”
The skipper looked at the speaker’s face, pricked
with a hundred tiny wounds, saw the blood trick-
ling from that open gash over the temple. Then
he said, quite softly, “Go forrard and turn into
your bunk for awhile, and I’ll send you a glass of
grog.”

A Melbourne bride sued her Romeo for
maintenance, the other week, under circumstances
of considerable interest to the “Wild-Cat Column. ”
She and her adorer got married on the day of
Lord Brassey’s arrival, since when they have lived
unhappily. The wife started by pawning her
wedding-ring for 125., probably because her hus-
band, on his own admission, can only allow her
ss. a week, a small amount considering that he
hasn’t provided a home for her at present. He
is floating a mining company, and has to “spend
money to induce people to take shares. ” If they
don’t take shares the mine will not float. There-
fore, it will be doing the lady a kindness to take
shares and place the would-be floater in a state of
affluence. Meanwhile, the wife of his bosom
exhorts him to “ leave the Stock Exchange and
work on the sewerage.” Shares can be obtained
in the street on application.
“But Lost Labor.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sharp rap of the hammer resounded
through the burning, breathless atmosphere, and
to one man the noise was as joyous as Ins marriage
bells. He paused in his work, kneeling. on the
roof and balancing a strip of corrugated iron, as
he glanced at the place where he had lived so long.
The fruit colony is full of quaint dwellings, but,
in this one, the ridiculous was lost in the pathetic.
On a rude wooden framework were stretched
pieces of torn, weather-stained sacking, often all
too small for the gaps they were intended to nil.
These, where the winter winds had perhaps swept
in too cruelly, were patched with pieces of old
kerosene-tins, or wood from packing-cases, so that
one read, “ ’s Lager Beer,” upside down ;
above, “ ’s Scotch Cream Whisky.”
All available money and labor had apparently
been extended on the fruit-drying house—a neat
little wooden erection over which a passion-vine
climbed. The block was clean and free from
weeds, and the little channels for the irrigating
stream had just been dug out, close by the rows of
healthy trees. The man’s look, as he pushed back
his slouch hat from his damp, sun-scorched face,
was full of contentment. The discomfort, the
alternate extremes of heat and cold in his miserable
apology for a tent, had never troubled him. He
had always had this present moment before his
eyes, and now, as he looked with pride on his
almost com [lie ted three-room cottage, his eyes
grew dim with the thought of swiftly-arnvmg
bliss. The toil of clearing and ploughing, the
agony of disappointment when the one expected
year s exile from wife and baby slowly lengthened
into four, the bitter rage when he discovered how
the nursery man had cheated him in his plants,
the despair when the workmen struck and there
was no one to work the pumps, the loneliness and
the starvation, all were forgotten now. His navel
oranges had carried off a prize, and the Melbourne
market had demanded more of his own brand of
dried apricots, and now his loneliness would end.
He wrote home, as he began to build, and for the
first time his letter spoke the whole truth. It
would be a lonely life and a hard-working life.
There would be struggles and uncertainties, but —
and to him that but redeemed all—they would be
together. “Then come,” he wrote, “I am already
counting the hours before your dear feet can touch
Australian soil.”
To-day’s mail might tell him when she would be
starting. Perhaps she was already on her way.
When he heard the five o’clock whistle, he would
knock off work and ride into town for his letters.
* * * *
Down the river bank on the way to the
old homestead was the only place where he oould
have solitude for thought. The water was whirl-
ing down mid-stream, and nearer the banks were
little eddies and whirlpools and counter currents,
where the white foam swirled round stalwart
eucalyptus trees. A treacherous river and a deso-
late, and the man needed that dread desolation to
help him to think. In his ears was a surging
noise that was louder than the river. Before his
eyes all was vague and uncertain, for his sight was
thrown inwards on his brain, and there he saw—
chaos ! He took out the crushed letter again and
tried to read it. There must be some mistake.
What was it ? What did it mean ? “I am afraid
to face such a life. . . . The child is not very
strong. . . . Could you not come home and try
for some employment here ? ” These sentences
stood out black and cruel, but he could read no
more.
* * * *
There were voices behind him as some
men ran down the bank.
“ Come and have a swim,” said one who came
close. “ Hullo, old man, are you ill ? You look
ghastly. ”
“ I’m not bad,” said the man. “ A dip will set
me up.”
It was hard work battling against the strong
current. All his life he had done nothing else. He
was tired of it —very, very tired. So he gave up
the fight.
* * * *
Next mail brought another letter for him.
“You had better read it, doctor,” said the post-
master, “as you are settling up the poor chap’s
affairs. ” So the doctor read :
“I had a dreadful dream about you last night.
It frightened me so much, and made me think
how selfish and cruel my letter must have seemed.
Please forgive me. I was anxious at the time
about the child, but now I have decided to come
to you, and, if necessary, to leave her in Eng-
land. I shall be on my way when this reaches
you.”
The doctor tore the letter in pieces, for now he
understood.

drops round about dinner-time on Sunday, and be

cook, in a state of whisky, derisively laughs and
waves her weekly pound-note over the back fence.

NATHAN HERMAN, “ Misfit Parlor,” Sydney.
Dear Sir —Your Bale and other goods to hand some time ago, but
through the past dry weather I have been kept so busy that I have not
had the opportunity of writing before. Referring to the the <£2 Bale
of fit-out I must mo.-t certainly say it is the best value I have ever seen
or heaid of the suir. being an admirable fit, and you may depend that
in future whatever I require in any way I will procure at your house,
and will advise as many as possible to patronise you. As lam well-
known in the district, no doubt you will obtain a good many orders, as
I will do my utmost to secure you patronage. You may, if you choose,
put this into any paragraph or translation you choose and publish it if
it is of any service to you, as no one once purchasing from you will ever
deny the fact of the cheapness and durability of the articles purchased.
Enclosed please find 7s. 6d. in stamps, for which please forward by
return of post one of your Watches and Chains, as I want it for one of
my boys. Trusting you will favor by return of post,
I remain, yours faithfully, W. H. COCHRANE.

NATHAN HERMAN, Esq.
Dear Sir —I am just in receipt of your favor of 22nd instant, and
the Watch, for which accept my best thanks. I think I will be able to
give you an order for one or two more shortly. My own is still keeping
splendid time. By all means publish my letter. I think the general
public should know what good value you are giving for the money. I
am well-known here and in Armidale and Melbourne. —Believe me,
yours sincerely, JOHN M'BEAN, Senr.

Dear Sir, —Yours of the 11th inst. to hand, and am much pleased
in replying to it. For two years I have been purchasing teas from you,

superior to tea that before I had given 2s. a lb. for in Bathurst, and
you are quite at liberty to make use of this as a testimonial. —Yours
truly, SAMUEL STOW.

These proofs of what can be got at the MISFIT PARLOR are
positively genuine, as some of the know-alls may shake their heads
and perhaps doubt it. For the information of those who perhaps may
not be aware of the fact, I assert that no newspaper will publish any
letter without the Original Copy, and I am willing to hand over =£soo
to local cha ities if anyone can refute the veracity of such testimonials.
