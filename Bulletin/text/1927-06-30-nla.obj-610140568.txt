Genius
The spark of genius! Many have been
fascinated by it and some have sought to
understand it, to discover what it is that
fans it into flame, that gives its fortunate
possessor clearness of vision, unerring dis-
crimination and creative power. The ex-
planations offered for genius are numerous;
most contain elements of truth, none is
wholly adequate. One would have us regard
it as indicating—nay, almost identical with
—degeneracy and insanity. Another denies
any such derivation. Yet another look
upon its manifestations as the substitute
for early infantile desires. Whatever ulti
mate view is taken of genius as a whole
all must admit that there is an initial some
thing—something given by Nature, the
capricious, the elusive and the incompre
hensible. The way in which this motive
power, if it may so be called, is brough
into action and allowed free play has been
considered by Arthur C. Jacobson in Genius
Some Revaluations (Adelphi Company, Ne\
York).
According to Jacobson’s thesis,' genius i
the manifestation of the unconscious mind.
The genius is a superman whose creative
spirit resides, not in the primary self, bu
in the secondary personality. Genius canno
become effective until the primary self i
suppressed, until the shifting of the gear,
has been effected. Several means o’
shifting the gears are considered by the
author. Thus of alcohol, there has nevei
been a time when it has not played a part
in the intellectual activities and cultura
progress of the world. Horace wrote
“Bacchus, whither art thou hurrying me
full of thy power? I will send forth
noble strain, new, as yet unuttered by other
lips.” Since that time a multitude of
writers, even up to the present time, have
done their best literary work when wine has
in the words of Francis Grierson, “sharpenec
the wit and given power to the wings o'
genius.” Sufferers from tuberculosis are
compensated by Nature by an extreme
optimism. But a few hours prior to death
they will make plans for the future—what
they will do when they get well and how
much they will enjoy this and that. This
spes phthisica, as it is called, with its
associated psychic excitation, has been
means of quickening genius, and has pro-
duced literary fruit of the highest order
Jacobson gives as an almost sure recipe foi
producing the highest type of creative mine
tuberculosis added to an initial spark of
genius. In Robert Louis Stevenson is founc
a striking example of the spes phthisica
De Quincy’s great intellect was modified by
tuberculosis plus opium. Keats and Shelley
were both tuberculous and produced theii
most brilliant work while in the last stages
of the disease. Francis Thompson, “the
greatest achievement of Catholicism in the
nineteenth century,” typifies the tuberculoiis
genius of the highest order. Thompson was
not a drunkard or in any way depraved
When destitute and desperately ill, he
became a victim to laudanum, and this
enabled him, as it did De Quincy, to cope
with his neuralgia and tuberculosis, to give
free play to the spes phthisica.
An individual of fairly pure ethnic strain
will not reveal incongruous traits assign-
able to different personalities. A thorough-
bred, be he human or canine, is an individual
who can be expected to behave in particular
ways in certain circumstances, according to
influences transmitted by thousands of
ancestors. The mixing of dissimilar breeds
compels the progeny, when confronted by a
situation in which two or more lines of
ancestors would have proceeded differently,
to think, and thinking gives rise to new
ideas.
A. G. Stephens, writing in the Red Page
some years ago, stated that, generally speak-
ing, a mind’s class is fixed by heredity and
its place in the class by environment. Gener-
ally speaking, this is so. A mind of superior
grade is a sine qua non to the develop-
ment of genius. The heredity is not always
obvious. Genius is a rarity, and in the
majority of instances springs from places
where its origin would be least suspected—
from the abnormal, the defective, even, from
the criminal and insane. At the same time,
the genius often rises superior to his environ-
ment.
Is genius, then, to be considered part and
parcel of. the abnormal, the defective and
the criminal? Is it identical with these
conditions? Jacobson says no:—
“Degenerate stock manifests an affinity for
the genius which normal breeds lack. This
is only a putting of peculiar soil to glorious
use. This soil cannot be identified with the
flower that it bears. It is thrillingly peril-
ous horticulture; the most precious thing in
the world has. to be entrusted to gardeners
whoso aspect is of a most sinister character
but who seem to be the luckiest of husband-
men. Commonplace stock, on the other
hand, can never be put to any but common-
place uses. Genius is a supernormal endow-
ment resident in a tenement of dubious but
affinitive antecedents.”
Instinctively there come to mind the
words of Francis Thompson:—
Ah! must—
Designer Infinite!—
Ah must Thou char the wood ere Thou canst
limn with it?
Jacobson sees the practical application of
his ideas. The care for the unfit and the
elimination of conditions giving rise to
abnormalities will deprive the world of
geniuses. The worshippers of hygiene and
of eugenics, and those who strive for social
betterment, would not recognise a genius
and would make it impossible for him to
develop.
P.B.M.
America’s Coming of Age
No country is receiving more publicity
that the United States. Travellers’
sketches and publicists’ impressions literally
pour from the publishers. And, beside all
else, there are the native American exposi-
tions, the meticulous realism and excruci-
ating detail of Dreiser, the brilliant charac-
terisations of Sinclair Lewis, the epigram-
matic flagellations of Mencken. And
withal we are little the wiser. It has
remained for a stranger who is not Anglo-
Saxon at all to explain America to her
neighbors both east and west. Professor
Siegfried has the qualifications of a great
expositor, for he combines the objectivity
of a scientist with the psychological subtlety
of a countryman of Proust.
His description of Post-War Britain was
the most outstanding essay on that subject
by any writer north or south of the Channel.
Now he has turned to America, and in
America Comes of Age (Cape, London)
has drawn Uncle Sam in the manner of a
great portraitist, “warts and all.” It is
even more fascinating than the picture of
John Bull.
More than a generation ago Lord Bryce
taught, America that English scholars were
capable of justice. Now Professor Siegfried
teaches them that French scholars are cap-
able of brilliance, penetration and subtlety.
In some respects he has the advantage of
his illustrious predecessor, for Englishmen
are just kin enough to America to lose the
advantage of the “outsider’s” eye. Canning
“called a New World into existence to
redress the balance of the Old.” This
author redresses the balance of the New
World by recalling the existence of the Old.
Firstly the book deals with the racial
and social problems of modern America.
Then follows a brilliant survey of the pre-
sent economic situation. Finally there
comes a picture of the political scene. The
thread connecting all is the problem of the
“assimilation” of the foreign races.
Professor Siegfried does not see the
States as a “melting pot” from which will
pour forth a new product combining the
qualities of the ingredients in a homogeneous
new metal with characteristics of its own.
The nearest metaphor is that of a river with
tributaries. The main body of the stream
is made up of the Anglo-Saxon Protestant
strain which originally peopled the colonies,
and still maintains the tradition of leader-
ship. Flowing in from different directions
come other streams, Irish Catholics and
Jews, German Lutherans and French
“cynics,” and the whole host of Southern
Europeans graphically classified as Dagoes.
Socially the problem is to dam back these
streams until they shall have lost their
peculiar characteristics and may mingle with
the main flow without discoloring it. This is
the central problem of America. Prohibi-
tion, Fundamentalism, immigration restric-
tion and the Ku-Klux-Klan all are reactions
to it.
Driven from the Atlantic littoral the
“real American” now holds the vast area
of the Middle West, the area between the
Alleghanies and the Rockies, and fights to
retain his grasp. Most of the issues upon
which he meets his enemies are to be ex-
plained in terms of race. Look at a map
of the population showing the areas where
there are less than 50 p.c. native Americans.
Then look at the map showing where pro-
hibition enforcement is lax. The coinci-
dence is not a mere accident. The German
still clings to his bock, the French, the
Italian and the Greek to his wine. Where
are the anti-evolution laws being promul-
gated? Again the population map pro-
vides the answer. In the realm of politics
the same situation emerges. Here for the
first time the great political parties of
America are made understandable to the
outsider. These are not, as the author ex-
plains, collections of people who agree upon
particular political doctrines. They are
largely racial collectivities. The battle of
opinion is fought out by propaganda groups,
which penetrate and influence each party,
and which mould and formulate public
opinion. On the whole, the Republicans
represent the Anglo-Saxon tradition, the
party of stability and American culture.
The Democrats collect the oppressed minori-
ties, the new-comers, the groups who, in
O’Neill’s expressive phrase, “do not belong.”
By a curious irony the South, a stronghold
of the older civilisation, votes solidly Demo-
crat. But the negroes explain this. By a
more curious irony, this party finds its
political centre in New York, the polyglot

centre of foreign penetration. That is why
A 1 Smith, the Catholic, Tammany, Wet
Governor of New York will be the next
Democratic candidate for President, and
why the “Dry” descendants of cotton-grow-
ing Virginian Anglicans will vote for him.
Over everything the author sees the
terrific force of regimentation which the
Americans call assimilation. Mass pioduc-
tion has escaped from industry to society.
Concerning that industry, of which the (put-
side world hears so much, the author is a
little doubtful and a little afraid. Even
prosperity has its dangers. “It is,” he writes,
“a materialistic society organised to produce
things rather than people, with output set
up as a god.” Again: “In America the
greatest possibility of becoming rich does
not lie in the subdivision of existing wealth,
for it is easier to create new wealth.”
His greatest admiration is reserved lor
America’s financial policy and her wise re-
straint in her handling ol the monetary
situation. But even here there are dangers.
In the growth of the “creditor psychology”
may lie one of the most insidious forms of
demoralisation which can befall a nation.
Nevertheless, he realises the enormous suc-
cess with which America has moulded her
economic system since the war, both in
the direction of efficiency and increase of
output. His' final comment is suggestive.
“Germany,” he writes, “is the only other
country that has tackled the problem with
the same forethought, method and daring.
England, in spite of her excellent craftsmen,
is hindered by her trade unions, and France
by her politicians.”
P. D. PHILLIPS
On Choosing School Prizes
Everyone, I suppose, has heard of the
Scotsman who declared that he believed
in Liberty, Equality and Frugality. Now
I have sufficient of the Scot in me to make
me desire to spend even other people’s
money to advantage. I had the disposal of
£l5-ss. to buy prizes for those heading the
list at the Leaving Certificate examination,
and £lO for prizes awarded for improvement
in sport, half the amount being for the'boys.
Picture me, therefore, with eight or ten
catalogues, luxuriating in their closely-
printed pages and whetting my wits against
those of the compilers so as to spend the
money to advantage.
For the senior boys who received a guinea
or so I chose in one case a complete edition
of the “Poems of John Masefield” (10s.
6d.), a copy of “Men, Beasts and Gods,” of
which a creditably produced edition has
just been locally issued at 6s. Of this amaz-
ing book, by Ferdinand Ossendowski, I
should like to hear some authoritative
opinions; I have read it long since with
avidity, and bear witness to its undoubted
fascination, but how much of it is true? My
friend Nathan F. Spielvogel, the author of
“The Gumsucker oh the Tramp,” unequivo-
cally brands the author of it as a liar—
and he. ought to know! The rest of this
lad’s guinea was devoted to a copy of the
“Collected Poems of Henry Newbolt”
(Nelson, 2s. net), one of the most treasured
of all the boys’ books known to me, and a
half-crown copy in “Everyman’s Library”
of R. L. Stevenson’s “Virginibus Puerisqus,”
and “Familiar Studies of Men and Books,”
both in the one volume. The best of
Stevenson is now available in “Everyman’s
Library,” that altogether satisfactory col-
lection of the world’s best literature.
The other lads’ books consisted of the
Australian edition of “With Lawrence in
Arabia,” by Lowell Thomas (Bs. 6d. net), a
highly interesting book about the modern
Richard Burton; Curie’s stimulating and
provocative “To-day and To-morrow; the
Testing Period of the White Race” (Curie
spent his boyhood in the Riverina and has
much to say that is of interest to the thought-
ful. Australian youth); the half-guinea
edition of J. M. Barrie’s charming comedy,
“Quality Street,” with colored plates by
Hugh Thomson that are worthy of the play
itself; and, fourthly, Harrap’s beautiful
edition of Emily Bronte’s “Wuthering
Heights,” probably the greatest novel ever
achieved by a woman. This fine piece of
bookmaking, priced at Bs. 6d. locally, con-
tains about 16 beautiful colored plates.
In choosing books I have tried to select
those that are not only of present attrac-
tion, but also of permanent interest. Too
many school prizes are as the grass that to-
day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven.
Present mirth hath present laughter, and
youth will be served. I tried to obey both
these dicta by allotting one small boy
Norman Lindsay’s lavishly illustrated
volume, “The Magic Pudding,” wherein are
narrated the amazing adventures of Bunyip
Bluegum, a native bear; Sam Sawnoff, a
penguin; and Bill Barnacle, the sailor. “The
Magic Pudding,” issued originally at a
guinea, is now available in a cheap yet
beautiful edition at 4s. 6d.
For the girl who had secured not only the
best Leaving Certificate pass in the school,
but also the record for the whole Riverina,
I wanted to select H. G. Wells’s “Outline of
History,” in two volumes, at 255. This
with Hilaire Belloc’s attack and H.G.W.’s
spirited answer, and Hilaire’s further reply,
should have provided her with a souvenir
of probably the most sprightly literary
squabble of the present century. Here I
was over-ruled by the sportsmistress, who
chose padded leather poets, Longfellow and
“The Golden Treasury.” The beautifully
illustrated “Myths of Greece and Rome”
(Harrap; 12s. 6d.), like their illustrated
novels such as “Adam Bede” or “The Cloister
and the Hearth,” each with its 16 beautiful
color plates (Bs. 6d.), is excellent value for
the money and needs only to be seen to be
desired.
We were next faced with the problem of
selecting 20 boys’ prizes at about ss. each
for sport. Here there was a wide range of
taste to consider. A couple of the lads each
chose “Pears’ Cyclopaedia,” a book which,
if not equal to the “Brit.annica,” at least
holds information that I have sought for in
vain in the larger work. A book of which
upwards of two and a quarter million copies
have been sold needs little recommendation;
issued originally at one shilling before the
war, it now sells at 3s. 6d. and would be
cheap at a guinea. Each of these lads in
addition received a copy of the perennial
“Tom Sawyer,” the blood-drenched “Nada
the Lily,” or that enthralling historical
romance, “A Gentleman of France” (Wey-
man; 2s. lid.—a queer price). One boy,
having read “Sard Harker,” chose Mase-
field’s “Odtaa” (ss. 6d.); while for another
we chose Ernest Raymond’s manly and
touching war story, “Tell England.” A
couple of Sabatini’s at 3s. 6<l.—“Scara-
mouche” and “The Snare”—delighted an-
other lad, and the two volumes of “Monte
Cristo” in the “Everyman” collection formed
a judiciously expended 4s. 6d. for another.
“Marguerita de Valois,” “The Queen’s Neck-
lace,” “The Three Musketeers” and “Twenty
Years After,” all in the “Everyman’s
Library,” bear testimony to my affection for
Alexandre the Great. “Lavengro” and “The
Romany Rye” made a pair that ought to
introduce a grateful reader to that strangely
fascinating Bible colporteur, George Borrow.
Instead of these pairs of books_ at half a
crown each, in some cases we chose leather-
bound copies of “The Last of the Mohicans”
and of “Lorna Doone” in the same library
at 4s. 6d. No fewer than three lads chose
“For the Term of His Natural Life.”
I should like to have included more Aus-
tralian books. Australian girls are excel-
lently catered for by their own fellow
country-women; not so the boys. Apart
from Dr. Leach’s useful “Bird Book.” the
only Australian book I wish to mention is
“Out of the Silence” by Erie Cox (Vidler,
7s. 6d.). This Australian romance is novel,
mysterious, ingenious and enthralling; our
boys literally love it.
ALEX. C. WELSH.
Anthony Trollope’s Autobiography
Michael Sadlier has , performed a fine
achievement with his recently issued Trol-
lope—A Commentary, a contribution to the
recovering interest in the noted mid-
Victorian novelist which will probably super-
sede all other authorities on the subject.
In its compilation, Mr. Sadlier has had, as
he freely owns, the aid of Anthony Trol-
lope’s “Autobiography.” Yet he has been
not a little embarrassed by that very re-
markable book which, despite the reserva-
tions imposed on its author by his essential
modesty and good breeding, is still, in all
probability, the most honest book that was
ever written for publication.
Very properly, the commentary follows
the model of the autobiography in neglect-
ing such details of the novelist’s life as are
not relevant to the public’s understanding
of his work. One of the finest passages in
the older book reads:—
“It will not, I trust, be supposed by any
reader that I have intended in this so-called
autobiography to give a record of my inner
life.... If the rustle of a woman’s petticoat
has stirred my blood ; if a cup of wine has
been a joy to me; if I have thought tobacco
at midnight in pleasant company to be one
of the elements of an earthly paradise; if
I have now and again somewhat recklessly
fluttered a f5-note over a card-table; of
what matter is that to any reader? I have
betrayed no woman. Wine has brought me
no sorrow.... I will not say that I have
never scorched a finger, but I carry no ugly
scars.”
In these few phrases, a mere paragraph in
a two-volume book, Trollope dismissed all
that part of his life which he thought of
no public concern.
For the rest, he was superlatively honest.
Of course he told of his wonderful mother,
Frances Trollope, who began to write books
at the age of 50 in order to retrieve the
family’s fortunes, so sadly dissipated by her
loving, cultured and upright, but very wrong-
headed, husband. She succeeded in her
efforts. Anthony tells also of his wretched
boyhood, during which —and this is im-
portant—his miseries forced upon him a
belief that he was an inferior sort of being.
We learn, too, of his entrance into the post
office, his further years of wretchedness in
London, and of his ultimate transfer to the
rural districts of Ireland, where he at last
found content and happiness and began to
write novels. For 12 years he essayed this
latter task with sturdy persistence through
continued failure, until he- had his first
success with “The Warden” and “Barchester
Towers.” Success grew till with “Framlev
Parsonage,” written on Thackeray’s invita-
tion for the opening numbers of the Corn-
hill Magazine, he actually “arrived.”
Thenceforward his career as a novelist was
hard-working but prosperous. On the death
of Thackeray in 1863 he became the leading
novelist of England, which position he en-
joyed till the ’seventies, when, with the
dawn of a new epoch in history, his vogue
began to decline. When he died, in 1882,
his obituary notices were, as Mr. Sadlier
tells us, “at best tolerant, at worst con-
temptuous.”
But it was his own “Autobiography” that
finally slaughtered his reputation. Its post-
humous publication was in the charge of
his eldest son, Henry Merrivale Trollope,
to "whose memory Mr. Sadlier has dedicated
his “Commentary.” The “Autobiography,”
as its editor once told me, was at first well
received, being taken in the spirit in which
it was written. But a new generation was
arising to whose pseudo-sensitive ears Trol-
lope’s blunt honesty was anathema —a
generation of sentimental aestheticism and
pretentiousness, the generation of Oscar
Wilde, a generation whose absurd posturings
were so admirably satirised in the Gilbert
and Sullivan opera, “Patience.”
Trollope’s “Autobiography” told with per-
fect candor —nay, with pride—that he wrote
his novels for the material purpose of mak-
ing money. He gave his own very just rea-
sons for doing so. And, with his mother’s
example before him, his impecunious youth
behind, and the spirit of creativeness
stirred by his original experience of friend-
lessness, what wonder that he should choose
such a channel? Perhaps he overstated his
case in his anxiety; to reveal himself and
in his innate modesty. He never regarded
himself as a genius, and frequently ques-
tioned if he had merited the success that
had come to him. The habit of underesti-
mating himself had persisted from the, earlier
induced belief that he was of an inferior
make-up to other men. Why he should
not write for money is a wonder to us in
our age of carefully protected copyrights,
rigorously exacted royalties, schools of
journalism, and authorship accepted as a
profession. Perhaps we have something to
thank him for in this regard, and we can
surely admire the prodigious energy which
earned for him out of writing as a secondary
occupation the handsome fortune of £BO,OOO.
His autobiography quoted a little short of
£70,000, but he published 10 books after
that was written. “Comfortable but not
splendid” is what he called it lest he gave
impression of boasting.
But it was the statement of his methods
that shocked the elegant poseurs of the
’eighties and ’nineties. For the greater
part of his writing career he maintained his
postal appointment, and he hunted enthusi-
astically besides. In order to accommodate
the public of his day, who demanded plenty
of substance for their money, he rose to his
literary labors at 5 a.m. (his mother used
to start at 4 a.m.) and before 9 a.m. he
demanded of himself a daily average toll
of words, frequently writing to his opened
watch a set quota of 250 words to the
quarter-hour. He wrote in trains and he
wrote in ships, often between bouts of sea-
sickness. “Doctor Thorne,” perhaps his
best novel, was written in this manner. On
his voyages to Australia he had a desk
built into his cabin.
All these drab realities he told openly in
his “Autobiography.” Small wonder the
unreal and insincere generation which read
the book revolted against him. But in
the sophistication of broader and better
knowledge, and though his inimitable “Bar-
chester” novels be ever beloved, the “Auto-
biography” of Anthony Trollope is such a
monument of manliness and honesty that
it may yet come to be regarded as the
greatest book he ever wrote.
GORDON TROLLOPE.
A Satchel of Books
Sea Nymph, by It. Iv. Weeltes (Bios).
When spring came the thoughts of a young
man lightly turned towards Majorca, where,
according to this novel, lived a very desir-
able sea nymph. But marrying a sea nymph
may lead to sad consequences, as this tale,
full of picturesque bits and wildly-idealised
love-passages, duly sets out.
Looking Forward, by Booth Tarkington
(Heinemann). “‘You keep on believing
there’s a top rung where you’ll be happy,
said the doctor. ‘Where you'll be happy,’ the
patient repeated, and lie laughed. ‘Yes; I
guess that’s what’s behind everything else
in every life when you get right down to it.
Nobody ever does anything except try to
be happy. Well, if that’s true and every-
body is trying to be happy, it means that
nobody actually is happy. If you’re trying
to get to a place, you certainly aren’t there.’
This extract from “the hopeful pessimist ’ is
a fair sample of the blend of humor and
thought that informs the six sketches in dia-
logue which make up the contents of the
book.
Bold Bendigo, by Paul Herring (Sampson
Low; Robertson and Mullens). A century
ago the P.R. was a British institution having
for its supporters men of influence such as
the Duke of Wellington, Lord Palmerston
and Sir Robert Peel. Jem Belcher, Tom
Cribb, John Gully (progenitor of a popular
Speaker of the House of Commons) and
William Thompson (“Bendigo." shortened
from “Abednego”) were among the notable
prize-fighters in or about that period. Round
the career of the last-named the author has
woven a tale packed with excitement and
reproducing.'tire color of the day with iidelity-
Besides essential love interest the book does
not want in entertainment.-
The Three Waiters and Other Poems, by
A. M. H arbor d (Palmer). Rough stuff
about commonplace people and the souls
they possess. The verse is colloquial, but
it is more satisfying than the usual, pretty
fancies of which much modern verse is com-
posed
But Jack was looking quite nice to-night in his
white tie and his tails,
And she was rather pleased with herself in me
dress she found at the sales;
And all around were a lot of folk that she’d simply
have loved to know,
And really she’d quite enjoyed herself, and wasn’t
it time to go?
Theirs was a house on the Croydon Heights, they
knew its form so well,
That neither knew as she opened the gate that she
opened the gate of Hell.
For another week there was work to do and nowhere
at all to go
Till Friday next, when they’d do the' same. It was
better they didn’t know.

This Abbey Boot, designed
on a special last, fits without
strain—right from the start.
No risk of cramping the
foot—of hampering free
movement. The upper is
slightly curved at the lacing
to fit comfortably over the
instep arch. At back of ankle
it is cut lower—which pre-
vents any bulging there. The
smart-shaped toe is roomy
and strongly reinforced.
The boot naturally pre-
serves its good shape and
wears better, because it is not
strained in fitting.

Flight.
The hour has come, the crescent moon
Hangs pendent in the darkened sky;
One last look at familiar things
I J 1 take before I say “Good-bye.”
(O heart, wdiy do you sigh!)
It seemed so easy yesterday
„To say, “We’ll go to-morrow night.
\\ atch for the new moon in the sky
Ami when it’s risen take our flight.”
(Ihe moon is'silver dight.)
I thought that I could go at will,
M ithout desire to longer wait;
But. somehow, now the time has’come
My feet move at a leaden gait.
(I dare not to be late.)
Each evening as the wind goes by
The petals from this rose-tree fall,
And Johnny loves to pick them up
And spread them out and count them all.
(Dear John! so round and small.)
And John—but there’s no time to think,
The crescent moon is sailing high ;
My lover waits me at the gate
Unthinking of my last “Good-bye.”
(O heart, why do you sigh!)

Fantasy.
By marble balustrades
The purple peacocks gleam,
And palaces with white facades
Beside the river dream.
The sea is pale as milk.
For mast a peeled white rose,
A little ship with sails of silk
Moves out; where,, no man knows.
Slim turrets of delight,
Of jade and ivory,
With tiny, twisting stairs of white,
Beckon bewitchingly.
Down flowery woodland ways, •
Nude nymphs and sun-splashed fauns
Dance lightly where the syrinx plays
Along unshaven lawns.
Pale mosques and minarets
Of some lost Samarkand
Dream where the camel-driver sets
His face unto the sand.
Across the sunset sky
My soul has sped afar
To radiant realms, remote and high,
And found the first frail star.
A myriad sights I see
In this strange sunset-world,
Here, with my fancy floating free,
Each eager sail unfurled.
I shall come back to earth,
With all its fume and fret,
With all its foolish counts of worth—
But not, ah no! not yet!
A little longer here
To dream the hours away,
Where night—dark flower without compeer—
Buds on the stalk of day!

Immunity.
Oh. I’ve been hurt, so have no heart at all
To e’er be hurt by loving. Break your
spear
Against the citadel. No battle-call
Can shake the avails I builded in my fear.
Oh, I’ve been hurt. To wake at dawn and
know
Terror descending like an eagle’s wing;
And then the long day’s agony, the slow
Sinking to darkness, where the grey ghosts
cling.
Oh, I’ve been hurt. So now, when love comes
down
Clad in. his velvet and bright silver slioon,
I know him ragged—just a sorry clown
With empty fingers clutching for the
moon !

My Lady Life.
Out on the blue, foam-petalled sea.
And on the white flame of the day,
She gazes from her balcony,
Then turns her languid eyes away.
She gives me not one glance ; the road
I tread grows hateful, and I seem
A slave predestined to the goad.
And she some princess of a dream.
Yet sometimes unawares she slips
Her hand in mine; and I have known
Her kisses on my tired lips,
With wilder passion than my own.
To-day she yawns—Love’s April rule
Put by, as is my lady’s way—
Queen of Caprice she laughs: “O fool!
I have forgotten yesterday.”
And yet I am content! I know
Some dusk, when flame with shadow
blends,
Her lips on mine, will murmur low,
And make my heart divine amends.

For a happy horoscope,

Bevelling in blows and scars ;
Fighting youth is ruled by Mars.

With their, wine-cups come between us,
Young men’s thoughts are turned to Venus.

And he’s still a bachelor.
He is done with love and war.
Love is never what Love seems.

He will have the realm of dreams.

Early Wattle.
ould you credit that summer was here la.-:t
night?
The sky is grey, and along the street
You can hear the clatter of winter’s feet.
Yet I can prove you the rumor right.
For summer has besom of purest gold,
And here and there in the silver trees.
With a pert protest at the westerlies,
With a sunny smile where the earth is cold,
Are straws of the broom that summer swept
Over the land in the dead of night.
They have rimmed the wattle with lines of
light
And the boughs grew glorious while we-slept.
I heard her sandals in Blakeney-street
And caught the musks of her leafy gown,
And I guessed how the empty twigs leaned
down
And made their prayer to her flying feet.
As she hustled the world with her broom of
gold,
Or rode like a witch on its shining stick—
Oh ! the sly young branches were bold and
quick
Stabbing a straw through a grey leaf’s fold!
Summer went over the hills last night;
She had rendezvous in a sparkling sea.
But her besom caught on the wattle-tree
And crowned its branches with scent and
light!

The Question.
A round white moon is rising up,
Its night-long reign begun,
While in the west, its reign at end,
Coes down a round gold sun.
Across a saltbush plain they stare
With rounded chins at rest—
The moon’s upon the eastern verge,
The sun’s upon the west.
Full faced, across green miles and miles.
Watched by the muted earth,
They gaze, one at its golden death,
One at its silver birth.
As thus they gaze, with leagues between—
Leagues stirless, leagues agleam—
Like one that questions, and like one
That answer makes, they seem.
Spelled by the wonder it beholds
The landscape holds its breath—
Amazed by that mysterious birth
And that mysterious death.
Xo wind-notes rise, no songs of birds
From bush and herbaee come;
For silence, strange and absolute.
Strikes all sound-makers dumb.
No stir is there, save that on high,
Betwixt the sun and moon, .
Black waterfowl, fast-flying, seek
Some lake or far lagoon.
South, south they speed, but ere they fade,
a speck in skies serene,
The moon, man-higli, soars in the east.
The sun no more is seen.
Beneath round skies, that moonlit seem
A milk-filled spacious bowl.
South, south they speed, that vanished flock.
Sure-flying to their goal.
Yet this I seek to know, though none
May tell me late or soon—
What was the question of the sun,
What answer gave the moon?

THE MAKERS OF UNEMPLOYMENT.
Australia is alleged to be entering on a
period of widespread unemployment. The
trouble isn’t equally diffused, but no State
is free from it, and the newspaper heading
about “Acute Distress” becomes common.
Further details will be lacking until the
March-June returns are available, but the
deputation which has brought its mattress
with it and camped on the Ministerial door-
step says that the position is going to be
worse. The wonderful lOU boom which
began about the end of 1921 is still going,
or at least it was recently when Slang of
N. S. Wales found another five millions in
New York, and there have been public
works galore. Yet the unemployed, accord-
ing to the trades unions which sent in
reports, reached 103 per 1000 unionists at
one period in 1924, and 102 per 1000 for a
quarter’s average in 1925, which weren’t
encouraging figures. If there was anything
in the illusion about the building up of
prosperity on a credit basis, N. S. Wales
should have a long lead, for its Government
of primitive ideas and Stone Age manners
has just completed the unparalleled feat (un-
paralleled for a single State) of beguiling
£14,000,000 in less than a year out of the
twin Uncles in London and New York. In
reality the first quarter of 1927 shows it
as having the worst out-of-work record of
the six States. Sundry visitants waited the
other day on Assistant-Minister Whang,
Premier Slang being away on an urgent
financial expedition, and told him that a
herculean effort must be made to invent
a lot more work, productive or otherwise,
or at least a lot more wages. To which
Assistant-Minister Whang replied that more
was already being done than in any other
State or by any previous Government to
invent work, productive or otherwise, or
at any rate wages, but if more effort was
demanded by reason of the misery of a
much-borrowing community, no deputation
would cry in vain. His colleagues Bang
and Clang would join him in finding wages
somewhere.
Simultaneously with this deputation the
Australian Industries Protection League cir-
cularised the entire Federal Parliament with
an elaborate statement of a cheerless sort,
and, so to speak, left the accusing corpse
to accumulate on the legislative doorstep.
As it put the case, if a country with a
great external debt borrows part of the
money, or all the money, abroad to pay
the interest, then it is able to get imported
goods in return for its exported goods,
whereas otherwise it might only get a
receipt for its liability. And if it borrows
abroad not only enough to pay the whole
interest bill, but a lot more, as is Australia’s
case, it is able to get imported goods for
its exported goods and a lot more. People
can’t import an immensity of foreign goods
and yet find well-paid employment in making
the same goods, which should be obvious
enough, though there are even Freetrade
university professors who appear unable to
see it. Wherefore a period of big external
borrowing has attached to it a period of
big imports, closely followed by a spell of
depression in the labor market. It doesn’t
matter much whether it is held that the
loans cause the imports or that the imports
necessitate the loans. The lack of employ-
men, somewhat mitigated by the construc-
tion of works which are often a permanent
burden on the community, is a result which-
ever way the matter is put.
The Child Endowment question may
introduce further complications. The basic
wage, combined with day labor and other
matters, gradually created a remarkable
situation. The wage, calculated in a loose
sort of way as sufficient for a man, wife and
two children, was the same for a man with
a, wife and six children as for a man with
only a wife or one with no wife at all. The
amount that industry, and especially a
strictly regulated species of industry, can
pay being rather limited, it followed that,
when one man got more than he required
out of the wage fund, another, who was a
much more useful citizen, had often to do
with a great deal less. In countries where
payment by results is the habit wherever
possible, the position is less difficult, for
the father of a family is often able to earn
more than the hobbledehoy by reason of
greater experience; but the Australian
system objects with great intensity to him
earning more. Many efforts have been made
to think out a way whereby the man with a
wife and children to support could get an
extra allow T ance for each child while the
bachelor man would still be paid for the
offspring he doesn’t possess and may never
possess, but the impossibility of finding the
money loomed up on every hand. In its
struggle to find a way out the N. S. Wales
Government took, the energetic step of in-
structing A. B. Piddington, Industrial Com-
missioner of the State (sometimes described
as “Good old Piddo”), to suggest such a basic
wage that the child endowment could be
superimposed on it without wrecking the
wage fund and industry with it.
Providing his friends with something to go
on with, the Ma State’s Industrial Com-
missioner indulged in an outburst:—
“When it is known in England that the en-
dowment of families is guaranteed by law in
Australia it will he an economic attraction
for migrants comparable only to that which
sprang into being witli the discovery of
gold.”
It, is devoutly to be hoped that “Good old
Piddo” is over-sanguine. Until the indus-
trial system .is radically altered so as to en-
courage production in every way, instead
of surrounding it with a wealth of intricate
restrictions, such a rush of population, either
to all Australia under a Federal scheme or
to N. S. Wales only, would have surprising
results. This would be especially so as
“Piddo” contemplates a rush of families,
whereas the great original gold rush was
mostly composed of bachelors and spinsters.
In a spacious country which is able to supply
its own needs and have something consider-
able over for export, it is possible that 1000
new producers would create enough wealth
to support 1050 or more. In Australia there
is a suspicion that they might produce
enough to support 950 or less, and that
public works would have to be found for
the rest. And the provision of public works
in such circumstances is a good deal like
eating your supper in the morning to nmkc
good a shortage in your breakfast.
ELECTORAL NARKS.
Oxe result of the war between the two
Labor factions in N. S. Wales is an exposure
of the folly of keeping separate State
electoral rolls when Commonwealth regis-
ters of the same body of electors could
be utilised. The idiotic business is a
nuisance to the people, who are compelled
to enrol in and notify changes of address
to two departments, neglect of the ridiculous
repetitions being punishable with fines; and
the cost of duplicating the various opera-
tions is, of course, considerable. Nor have
the victims of this waste the satisfaction of
knowing that the State departments, which
are all politically controlled, do their use-
less work well. ' The N.S.W. excrescence,
for example, was caught so unprepared for
the general election of which it has had
repeated forewarnings that the infliction of
the Lang Government, which represents 22
members in a House of 90, will be need-
lessly prolonged for months. Lang tendered
his resignation to the Governor (in effect,
dismissing Mutch, Lazzarini and the other
“moderate” Ministers) on May 26, and was
recommissioned on the understanding that
he would go to the country “at the earliest
possible date.” And “the earliest possible
date” may be in August, but is more likely
to be in October.
Yet the Slang Government could have
arranged for the use of the Commonwealth
rolls, as Vic., South Aus. and the Speck have
done, greatly to their advantage. There
are up-to-date Commonwealth rolls for
subdivisions corresponding to the new
N.S.W. single electorates; these could have
been adapted to State requirements in half
the time it will take to issue 1927 State
rolls, which are almost certain to be con-
gested, and with no large-scale disfran-
chisement such as will be necessary if the
Government falls back on the 1926 lists.
The Commonwealth rolls are continuous;
there is an incessant canvas by postmen in
metropolitan districts and by registrars and
agents in the country. At the last general
election a vote of 91.3 p.c. was recorded,
which indicates that the system produces
rolls which are reasonably clean. It also
has the virtue of being expeditious; during
the referendum period last year the N.S.W.
branch of the Commonwealth Electoral
Department had rolls in the printer’s hands
three days after the referendum was decided
upon, and the job was all finished in eight
weeks. The State rolls in N. S. Wales,
Queensland and Westralia are periodical,
not continuous, the collections being made,
for the most part, by the police. The police
do as well as men with a multitude of other
duties can be expected to do, but it is
notorious that these rolls contain the names
of many thousands more people than the
census-takers can trace (in Westralia, 210,949
were enrolled for the recent election,
although the total population, as estimated
by the State Statistician, was only 380,012)
and that the Commomvealth percentage of
votes polled is not even approached. It is
equally notorious that in the States which
insist on making up the rolls themselves
there is a marked tendency to practise elec-
toral “jokes,” a form of humor from which
the Commonwealth and the States which
have accepted joint rolls are refreshingly
free.
“Another serious defect of the periodical
collection” (the words are those of a Com-
monwealth select committee) “is that the
rolls may not be ready for an. emergency
election, and that old and unsatisfactory
rolls may be used. This was the experience
in N. S. Wales in the unexpected election
of 1925, when about 70,000 names which,
according to the more up-to-date Common-
wealth rolls, were wrongly on the State rolls
were traced by the Commonwealth electoral
officials.” The. word “unexpected” is mis-
applied, for the election was the normal
triennial affair—as a matter of fact, more
than three years elapsed between the 1922
and 1925 elections—but the select com-
mittee’s version is otherwise correct. It got
its information from E. B. Hakkness, Chief
Electoral Officer for the State. That gentle-
man frankly admitted the faults of the
system for which he and his fellow-officers
are blamed, though the politicians are re-
sponsible—the same is true in Queensland
and Westralia also—and said just as frankly
that he had “always advocated the principle
of a joint roll, but it was a matter for
Government action.” The select committee
in question was composed of four Nation-
alists, four Laborites and a member of the
Country party. It took voluminous evi-
dence on electoral law and procedure in
the six States and arrived at a unanimous
report. Some of its remarks are subjoined:
“The evidence on the subject of joint rolls
was overwhelmingly in favor of that sys-
tem. As a result of its operation printing
is facilitated, simplified and cheapened, and
electors are not exposed to the mistake they
frequently make, where State and Federal
rolls exist, of thinking they are on both
when they are really on only one. It was gen-
erally agreed that the Federal roll was
cleaner and more up-to-date than those of
the States. It is moreover a continuous roll,
whereas the States accumulate much dead
wood in the long interval between collection
by the police and publication by the electoral
authorities. In Victoria, South Aus. and
Tasmania the joint-roll system is now in
operation, and the results obtained are
admitted both by the State and Common-
wealth authorities and also by members of
political organisations of all parties to be
eminently. satisfactory. As a result of its
inquiries in N. S. Wales, Queensland and
Westralia, the committee can see no reason
why the system of joint rolls should not be
introduced in those States, and therefore
recommends that negotiations between the
Commonwealth and those three States should
be pursued until this very desirable system
is made uniform throughout the Common-
wealth.
The Bulletin's idea is that the negotia-
tions have been pursued long enough
(they have been going on for years) and
that it is a case for an ultimatum. This
should be to the effect that persistence in
refusal to accept so obvious a reform will
be taken as proof of cussedness or crooked-
ness. or both, and that the offending Gov-
ernment, be it Labor, Nationalist or
Nationalist-Country party, will be deprived
of a substantial proportion of its Federal-
aid money until it mends its ways.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Big-Family Fetish.
The Premiers’ Conference on Child Endow-
ment having produced nothing more excit-
ing than a nicely-balanced speech from Mr.
Bruce proving that something ought to be
done but nothing can be done, a gallery
speech by Mr. Lang and the promise of
yet another Royal Commission, it may be
assumed that the politicians really have no
clear ideas on the subject. It may be
assumed, too, that a Royal Commission will
not find very much material not already
at the disposal of politicians out of which
they can mould conclusions. It will take
men of a broader vision than has been
disclosed in recent conversations to cope
with a question whose ramifications run
through the whole of modern civilisation.
In earlier and less complex societies than
ours, the big family flourished for three
good reasons; it meant greater honor,
strength and security for the parents; both
men and women regarded parenthood as
one of the solid joys of life; and Pan
could not be cheated of the price for listen-
ing to his piping. Those three reasons have
now well-nigh vanished in civilised coun-
tries.
There are, of course, in even the most
highly-developed societies, folk without the
forethought necessary to apply limitations
to the number of their offspring. These
people are usually very poor; but, forming
quite a large proportion of the population,
their votes are of value. Their children,
to put it bluntly, are not likely to be of
the highest type of citizen if they inherit
their parents’ easy-going lack of responsi-
bility. And so Jong as the lower types of
humanity multiply more rapidly than the
higher types, the result must be a lowering
of the average of intelligence and character.
Of course all the people who have large
families are not poor; all the poor large
families are not unintelligent or lacking in
character. Poor lads with many brothers
and sisters who climb high on the ladder
of fame are a commonplace of every con-
temporary social life. But the exceptions
don’t disprove the rule that the unintelli-
gent breed more prolifically than the intelli-
gent. To grant a dole to poor people in
proportion to the number of their children
doesn’t therefore seem likely to help the
situation either.eugenically or economically,
even if the money is found by direct taxa-
tion, while if the dole is made a tax on
industry it cannot avoid becoming a posi-
tive evil.
Priminister Bruce breezily remarked that
there is a universal public opinion that large
families are desirable. If that were so, large
families would be more numerous, unless
some subtle distinction can be made between
public opinion and the private opinions of
those who form it. As a matter of fact,
very few people nowadays consider that a
large family, in their own particular case,
is desirable. Most Australians arc in favor
of a substantial increase in the population
of their continent, but few regard themselves
as being bound, as a matter of duty, to
add to the population as many of their
own descendants as possible. Nor can the
duty convincingly be preached by Australia’s
leaders of thought and opinion, political or
ecclesiastical. It is possible that civilisa-
tion, having got to the end of its circle,
may some day swing back to more primi-
tive notions than at present prevail. It
may be even possible for some bold spirits
to preach a renaissance based on the joys
of fatherhood and motherhood, but it is a
rather unlikely movement.
Public opinion being what it is, doles
to wage-earners with children, however
helpful to the beneficiaries, won’t do much
to increase the population. But the divorce
between the value of work performed and
the price paid for it will be advanced a
further stage if a man’s wage is made to
depend upon the size of his family; and so
far as the effect on industry is concerned,
it could be no worse if it depended on the
size of his feet
—
Domicile,
When Jones says “I live in such and such
a State and there I have my domicile"
he thinks that ends the matter. It seem?
so obvious; yet “domicile” is one of the
most complex and difficult tasks of adjudi-
cation.
In general terms domicile means the place
or country which is considered by law to
be a person’s permanent home; and by
country is meant the whole of a territory
subject to one system of law. One of the
multiple difficulties that arise out of this
question of the permanent home is to
what extent a man who leaves his original
domicile in one State by shifting into an-


other is still bound by the obligations that
may have been placed upon him by the
State lie leaves. Can he shake oft the
dust of the State in which he is domiciled
and at the same time the encumbrance of
Ainslik thought he could. In
1919 he was domiciled in Perth. He had
not only his permanent home there, he had
his wife also. In that year the lady made
a complaint in Perth alleging that her hus-
band had deserted her, and the Court made
an order, to which her husband consented,
that she should no longer be compelled to
cohabit with him and that he should pay
her £2 a week. Under the Westralian law
such an order has the effect in all respects
of a decree of judicial separation.
In 1922 Ainslie left Perth and went to
Sydney, and in 1925 the bright idea struck
him that once outside Westralia its decree
no longer affected him. He was, he fancied,
a free man so far as it was concerned, and
that £2 a week without marital compensa-
tion was an affliction. So ho made his way
to Justice Owen, who presides in Sydney
over the boring business of Divorce, and
there petitioned for a decree for restitution of
the conjugal rights he had disposed of in
Perth. The learned Justice saw no sound
reason why ho should not have his decree,
and granted it. It was quite clear to
his Honor that the decree of judicial separa-
tion had no effect outside the jurisdiction
of the Court that decreed it—Perth cer-
tainly could not poke its nose into Sydney.
So Archibald, having got his decree, sat
down to await the arrival of his wife in
the character of a submissive penitent,
amenable to the law of N.S.W., or, failing
that, to obtain a divorce.
But the lady did not take it thus; instead,
she carried the matter to the greater wis-
dom of the N.S.W. Supreme Court, The
Bench heard much argument, and finally
by a majority decided that the Judge in
Divorce had come to a wrongful decision.
Then Archibald carried his point to the
High Court. The question to be answered
by that august body was stated by Justice
Gordon, of N.S.W.: —
“Whether a decree of judicial separation
or an order having the same effect pronounced
by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
country of domicile of the parties will be
recognised as binding on the parties by the
court of another country in which they may
happen to be?”
The N.S.W. Supreme Court had much in
favor of the view that the Perth order of
judicial separation should be recognised by
the Sydney Judge in Divorce as binding on
the parties. The English courts have recog-
nised as having extra-territorial validity any
decree of divorce which is also recognised
as valid by the courts of the country of
the domicile. In an American case the
principle was carried still further. There
the domicile was in the State of New York,
but the divorce had been obtained in the
State of South Dakota, where residence
for a certain period and not domicile gave
jurisdiction to pronounce a decree. The
divorce so obtained was held to be valid
in New York. Divorced in South Dakota
meant equally divorced in New York. A on
could not be regarded as a divorced man
in the one State and a married one in an-
other. By a parity of reasoning Archibald
Ainslie could not claim to be judicially
separated from his wife in Westralia and
judicially united to her in N. S. Wales.
And so in effect the High Court held.
“On the whole.” said the Chief Justice, ‘I
am of opinion that the question should be
answered in the affirmative.” And in this
opinion a majority of the Bench concurred,
thus proving that there is no judicial separa-
tion between law and common sense.

Mutton Export.
“Hoki Mut”: That the Country party has
decided to encourage the mutton-export
trade (B. 16/6/’27) does not surprise me; it
merely adds to my feeling of nausea at
this common brand of political economy.
The last thing the mutton-export trade
requires is encouragement; any need for
worry as to the disposal of the State’s sur-
plus of sheep is uncalled for. The industry,
it. must be remembered, is working under
1927. not 1902, conditions; smaller paddocks,
better water supplies and railway facilities,
fodder conservation, and the top-dressing
of pastures all play a steadily increasing
part in reducing drought effects. Further,
the local demand and consumption of mut-
ton is a steadily improving factor; for the
year ended June 30, 1926, Homebush sales
totalled 2,333,263 sheep and lambs, exports
being 305,260 sheep and 381,716 lambs; for
the year ending June 30, 1915, sales were
2,796,525 sheep and lambs; exports, 1,529,702
sheep and 552.569 lambs. It is the local
demand that rather requires encouragement.
With a certain addition to the number of
secondary industries, an even higher stan-
dard of living, and a consequent increase
in population, the final extinction of the
mutton-export brand of political economist
is assured.
The red herring of comparison is always
drawn into a discussion on this question—
we are always told to consider what Maori-
land is doing. But M.L. remains a mutton-
producing, while Australia is a wool-produc-
ing, country. Any Australian attempt at.
having your cake and eating it is doomed
to failure. Incidentally, a study of the rela-
tive' figures reveals that, the peak periods
of Australian mutton export synchronise
with droughts, and consequent depressed
wool-production. This position is natural,
but it does not hold any argument in favor
of the export trade.
If Dr. Page and his party desire to lead
the producers back to the good old pre-
war days, they are proceeding on sound
lines. But that will mean—wages, 255. per
week; rations, “a quarter, half and two”;
sheep values, 10s. for fats and “Pray to
God” for stores; properties, unimproved,
overstocked, mortgaged and foreclosed.
That period saw the export companies earn-
ing boom profits. Do we want to sec them
doing it again at the price?
O
Bondi’s Council of Ten.
The N.S.W. branch of the National Federa-
tion goes in for pre-selection by so-called
electorate councils, representative or alleged
to be representative of members enrolled at
a shilling a head. The system gives an
obvious advantage to candidates who are
“in with the clique,” and accounts for the
party being cumbered with so many depress-
ing hacks. When an official or ex-official of
the organisation aspires to a seat the advan-
tage is overwhelming. This was illustrated
when the vacancy occurred in Warringah;
as soon as it was known that Archdale
Parkhill, general secretary of the Nat.
Federation, was after the nomination,
several other aspirants, one a former Mini-
ster, withdrew. Now ten members of an
electorate council at Bondi have selected
Miss Preston Stanley, a former employee
of the Nat. Federation, as Nationalist candi-
date for the Bondi seat in the State Leg.
Assembly, rejecting the superior claims of
H. V. Jaques.
Jaques and Miss Preston Stanley are
two of the five members for Eastern
Suburbs, which has been cut up into single
electorates under the law passed last year.
The gentleman has been member for five
years; the lady for two years. Successful m
1922, when she was unsuccessful, he was the
first of the three Nationalists to be elected
in 1925, getting 12,468 votes; she was the
third, with 9995 votes. There is no reason,
to suppose that Jaques has forfeited the
confidence of the constituents who have
twice returned him. He has been a good
member in every sense of the word, and a
faithful follower of Bavin, as the division-
lists show. On the other hand, Miss Pres-
ton Stanley was publicly rebuked b.v a
Nationalist M.L.A. for being frequently
absent from Parliament when her presence
would have been useful. That was in her
first year; her attendance record has im-
proved since.
Bondi is so predominantly Nationalist
that it would be perfectly safe to endorse
both Jaques and Miss Preston Stanley
and let the electors decide between them,
even though preferential voting is optional.
The course decided upon by the 10 ladies
and gentlemen of the electorate council is
patently dangerous. Jaques is a returned
soldier who left a leg in France. He is not
the man to ask for consideration on that
account, but if he is forced out of the
field, or branded as an Independent by the
Nat. Federation, thousands of Diggers will
want to know the reason why.
«
’Ops.
“Imported hops, £30,200,” mentioned in
“Superfluous Imports” (B. 2/6/’27), have
brought many small growers in Tasmania
face to face with bankruptcy. There are
about 3000 bales of the present season’s crop
unsold —and unsaleable.
Cut out of dense forest by years of toil,
the holdings in the Upper Derwent Valley
are too small to yield a living by general
farming. Many other hop-growing districts
are in the same position. With their money
all used in producing a costly article that
nobody wants, the growers are in desperate
straits. Yet it is no new story; it has been
going on and gradually getting worse for
some years. The Tariff Board, which fell
down on its job of restricting hop importa-
tions. knows it well. The Bruce Ministry is
also well aware of it, for growers’ deputa-
tions have worn holes in the departments
running backwards and forwards asking for
relief. Just to keep them warm on the grid-
iron. one of Mr. Bruce’s numerous Com-
missions is over in the small island preach-
ing increased production—right enough
where there is a profitable market, but, to
the swamped hop-growers, not bread, but a
stone.
Meanwhile the breweries, protected up to
the hilt against imported beer, contentedly
pay fat dividends and send the foreign seller
of cheap hops rejoicing on his way with
£30,000 a year in his pocket. That the Aus-
tralian grower is skittled in the process, is
neither here nor there.

Liquors and Flickers.
“Sol Malaprop” : The United States de-
clares that it can do without alcohol, and
even Australian brandy, which is the best
in the world, is rigidly excluded. In the
circumstances, I don’t see why Australia
shouldn’t do without United States picture-
show films and shut them out. Alcohol
is a much older and more deeply-rooted
institution than films, and brandy has a
medicinal value which films don’t possess.
It may be a source of crime, but the
violent and cowboyish film is one also, and
it starts to corrupt the rising generation
at an earlier age than alcohol usually does,
and keeps on at the work long after the
pubs are closed. Australia’s expenditure is
so vastly in excess of its income that unless
it learns to work a lot more it must begin
to do without things, and dispensing with
U.S. films wouldn’t be bad practice. If
would at least show the Yankee abstainer
that the Australian is no sybarite or molly-
coddle, and can swear off too.
Some of the evidence recently given be-
fore the Films Commission was a repetition
of the old story about how Brother
Jonathan dodges payment of Australian
income-tax, the simple process being for
the boss-man on the other side to charge
the agent or dummy here such high prices
on paper that no matter what profits he
makes he shows little or none to pay tax
upon. Another device is to insist that the
Australian buyer shall enter into long con-,
tracts, so that he can’t get the necessary
film unless he ties himself to the Yankee
supplier. The short way out of this diffi-
culty is to declare by law that the U.S.
article is wholly unnecessary, like Bourbon
whisky in the U.S. itself.
A curious item of evidence ran this way:—
“The United States Government has estab-
lished a motion-picture division of the
Department of Commerce to check, by
counter-action, attempts made by foreign
countries, including Australia, to limit the
importation of American films by legisla-
tion.”
If that is true it is a high-handed and
interfering act and should be a reason for
prompt retaliation. I believe in retaliation.
In many commercial matters, indeed, I hold
that Australia should retaliate first, and
let the other fellow follow suit if he likes.

Poison in Binghi’s Hands.
“Oombool”: Northern Territorians who feel
uneasiness about aboriginals being too so-
phisticated in the use of poison may be
largely to blame themselves. Since the
introduction of the Dingo Ordinance, which
made each scalp worth 55., whites have be-
come careless in handling strychnine, and
in many cases give a native poison to go out
dogging, and there is no way of preventing
him concealing a quantity. I feel certain
that no storekeeper in the North would sell
poison to a native, but it may occur that
a trusted boy is sent away poisoning, or
given a small quantity to get a few scalps
when he goes for his spell out bush, and no
matter how faithful and honest an abo. is
occasions are likely to arise when he cannot
resist the temptation to trade. On one
Northern station the boss had a round of
tins of fat tied beside the cattlepads, and
would send a “boy” round regularly to refill
the tins and collect scalps.
There is more reason for alarm, however,
in Central Australia, where it is common for
half-caste and full-blooded aborigines to
purchase poison openly, and nearly every
half-educated native who has been shaken
hands with and made a fuss of by foreigners
who are ignorant of the ways of natives
has a tin of strychnine in his swag, besides
a gun or rifle and cartridges. In most parts
of Australia the signature of any person who
purchases poison is required, and a record
kept; but laws and ordinances have a bad
habit of relaxing in places where population
is scan tv and authority is weak.
The Unconvincing Invader.
The periodical scare over the surreptitious
invasion of Northern Australia by hordes
of Asiatics having been given another trot,
the Home and Territories Department has
been constrained to say there is nothing in
it. And that seems just about right. Occa-
sionally there is evidence that a prohibited
immigrant has come in by this route, but
nothing has ever been heard of even a
moderate-sized incursion.
Apart from its isolation the wilder section
of the N.T.. which would naturally be
that preferred for secret landing parties, is
inhabited by hostile Binghis whose record
in the matter of butchering crews of stray
pearling and bcche-de-mer luggers is a
strong deterrent to adventurers. But the
best evidence of all is found in the decennial
census reports. The last of these, taken
in 1921. shows that the number of full-blood
non-Europeans in Australia was 18.03 per
cent, less in 1921 than in 1911. During
the intercensal period the Asiatic races most
concerned in the argument declined; the
Chinese by 5596, Japanese by 749 and
Hindus by 418. There is no reason to
presume that the northern littoral is less
under supervision now than it was in 1921;
and it. is certain that the visitors who come
in that way don’t stay there —they trickle
south, where the census can’t miss them.
So the marked decrease in the returns
forbids any possibility of the story of a
large-scale infiltration being true.
Hollywood.
Hollywood has just been elevated to the
dubious eminence of an international pro-
blem, like the Bolshie and the Turk. The
Council of the League of Nations has de-
cided to send a questionnaire to the Govern-
ments of all countries regarding the effect
of the movies on the cosmic kid.
This important matter isn’t agitating the
mind of the Australian parent only. The
Hindu paterfamilias is asking for a more
rigid censorship of films, although last year
16 of Hollywood’s masterpieces were con-
demned and over 60 mutilated by the local
censor’s scissors; the Javanese press is com-
plaining of the way social bonds are being
loosened by too much divorce and adultery
on the screen; and even in war-sozzled
China there is a native organisation which
aims at preserving the local brand of morals
from the onslaught of the film. Japan has
achieved the largest measure of success.
There the indigenous production is rapidly
overtaking the torrent of imported stuff.
The present situation is unique in history.
The virtues of Clapliam have always been
vices in Martaban. Each country has got
along comfortably with a code of conduct
which other countries have regarded as
dangerous and inapplicable to themselves.
Even small attempts to alter the standards
of a race have always been resisted, with
thumb-screws, spears or guns. It has re-
mained for Hollywood to try to standardise
the ethics of the entire globe.
♦
Children’s School Age.
“N.Q.”: The age at which a child should
first attend school, queried by “Country
Fed.” (B. 2/6/’27), depends on what alter-
natives offer at home. An only child needs
to go to school early, if it is not to grow
up seeing everything through the eyes ol
the previous generation. Children bring
each other up enormously. Kindergarten
schools, for children under six (and kinder-
garteners would like to keep children up to
eight years), are simply excellent substitutes
for a very good home-training. If brought
up in the Bush, such a child can develop
almost all the aptitudes so artfully stimu-
lated in the fixed surroundings of the
kindergarten. He has contact with flowers
and beasts and jobs, and can easily be
taught to read and write and count.
Count? Ah, there’s the rub, or one of
them. If it were not for arithmetic, it
would hardly be so necessary for a family
of children to go to school even at eight.
It is almost impossible, though, to teach
children arithmetic without set hours, many
of them, and competitive drill. Other sub-
jects can be more or less mastered in
kangaroo hops, appealing to the child’s
interest; but sums mean adding brick to
brick, day after day. In the State school
whose curriculum I have watched, then 1
is always half an hour, morning and
afternoon, for arithmetic. What is not right
in the morning is done again in the after-
noon, or else new work is tackled. There
is no possible leak in the method. It would
take a mother or father of almost super-
human tenacity to teach a child at home
with the same success. Besides, except in
a large and very coeval family, there would
not be the stimulus of competition.
All this is written on the assumption that
arithmetic, when brought to a pitch of
mechanical smoothness, is a valuable accom-
plishment. It probably is, when well
counterbalanced by the humaner studies of
language and history. For intensive work
in subjects other than arithmetic, a child
can probably learn much more quickly at
home with a zealous teacher, parental or
otherwise: but this means missing the
experience of school-life, the politics and
parties and humors of that queer little
commonwealth to which they rush off
through frost or dew every morning.
By the way, in the present state of our
Education Acts, parents who wish to experi-
ment with keeping children at home till
eight will do well to build over a mile or
so from the nearest school: otherwise the
choice of attendance will not be in their
power.
“Prop”: Drovers at Homebush (Sydney)
and practically everywhere else in Australia
brand the fat cattle sold to the butchers with
gas-tar. each buyer’s cattle carrying a dis-
tinctive daub. At, Forsyth’s tannery, Wil-
loughby. I saw the tanned hides, and in
every case where the tar had been used the
leather was burnt through and ranked as
damaged. Apart from the economic loss, the
beast must suffer considerably. Perhaps the
S.P.C.A. could force a remedy.
♦
“Crcesus”: Surely with its varied climates
Australia could grow dates somewhere! A
few trees bear fruit here and there in
Queensland, northern South Aus., and in the
Murray fruit districts, but as they are
usually isolated and untended, they furnish
little evidence of possibilities. Abdul B.
Abdullah, Mesopotamia, exports so much
of his country in each box of dates that
one wonders how long it will stand the
drain. Boxes are found to be half plain
dirt, and retailers find themselves obliged
to pick over every pound of the fruit, The
dessert dates in cartons look cleaner, but
when we know the insanitary conditions
under which they are packed, there is little
inclination to give them the benefit ot the
doubt, Dates are a serious competitor of
Australian raisins, and the dried-fruit
growers have asked for an increase of duty
on the imported fruit, If a sufficiently
stiff increase is made to substantially reduce
the consumption of the unpleasant goods,
both the public and the Australian grower
will benefit.
*
“Ess”: A North Coast (N.S.W.) farmer
was a frequent applicant for the partially-
trained Government-farm boys. None of
them stayed with him long; at the first
opportunity they drifted back to the city,
their zest for the land gone for ever. This
man had able-bodied sons, but they were in
the city, too, the result, no doubt, of their
farm experiences under father. The point
is that placing boys on farms without
closely investigating the sort of place and
boss they arc going to is apt to defeat the
object of the training. A farmer who real-
ises the position of the boy in his new en-
vironment takes him steadily at, first until
he gets used to the place and his muscles
are trained to the work. But some start
him off at heavy pressure to see what he
is made of, and he goes to his bed the
first few nights with a sob in his throat
and a heart-sick yearning for his city
haunts.

POINTS
If countenance is given by Vic. Labor
Cabinet to Preudergast’s proposal for rein-
stating the 1923 police strikers the Ministry
will be challenged on the first bill (one to
provide a month’s supply) on July 6.
Ilogan’s team is between the devil and the
deep sea. If it does put back the ex-police
it will risk defeat in the Assembly; if it
doesn’t it will incur the wrath of the pan-
jandrums of the P.L.C.
There is a strong feeling among the new
Lang Government’s faithful supporters in
the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly that one of them
should be appointed to the post refused by
McKell. If that were done, it is pointed
out, the party would be perfectly balanced
in the only House that counts, for there
would be 11 Ministers and 11 non-Ministers.
And in the event of a dispute arising in
Caucus between Ministers and non-Ministers,
the Premier, as chairman, would have a
casting vote; thus the dictatorship conferred
on him by the Seale conference would be
preserved. It is recalled that the Hughes
party in the House of Reps, after the con-
scription split consisted of a whole 14 mem-
bers, of whom eight were named Ministers.
The Government thus constituted carried
on for three months.
The meeting of the second Irish Free
State Parliament was spectacular and emo-
tional, but so far as the Republicans were
concerned it wasn’t profitable. The De Val-
era people demonstrated at the doors and
shouted through the windows that they
wanted to legislate without taking the oath
“to a foreign king,” or wanted it abolished,
or something. As their coming into the
House would almost certainly have meant
the Cosgrave Government going out of office
the Cosgraveites showed no desire to oblige.
Impassioned appeals to commit suicide left
them unmoved. Afterwards the irreconcil-
ables paraded Dublin in waggons, but that
didn’t help much.
The Broken Hill Prop, is reported to be
turning four of its cargo-tanks into oil-
burners, so that they will use imported fuel
instead of taking Australian coal at New-
castle, though they touch that port on every
voyage. The object is to eliminate the fire-
man, and a good many shipowners are mov-
ing in the same direction with the same
object in view. The type of hard-drinking
shoveller who holds up ships periodically and
indefinitely could be coerced by his union,
which has powers of fine, suspension and
expulsion, and with careful treatment he
might become a prohibitionist. But as the
union never becomes active the inference is
that it approves.
It is not so easy to draft a Greater Mel-
bourne Bill as Labor imagined when it took
office in Vic. Apart from the franchise
stumbling-block (it will be impossible to get
adult suffrage through both Houses), there
will be the bother of taking over municipal
liabilities if there is to be one council instead
of 26. It will not be surprising if the
measure is merely trotted out for an airing
iu the session which is to begin on Wednes-
day, July 6.
A difficulty that wasn’t foreseen when
Canberra’s land laws were drafted lias
cropped up. Under the ordinance only
British subjects can lease the soil of the
Territory; and no provision has been made
for the needs of foreign consuls. The U.S.
Government, for one, proposes to erect build-
ings at a cost of £100,009.
The British House of Peers has started a
movement for its own reform. Some of its
members have realised that it is an anach-
ronism, and that, like a left-over pterodactyl,
is apt to attract the attention of sportsmen.
For one thing the House is too large. There
were 176 peers in 1685 ; now, with the Irish
Free State left out, the number is 740. Most
of them, however much they may like being
peers, think legislation a bore, and it was a
record in recent years when 268 were got
together at once. If Britain's Upper House
can reduce itself to reasonable dimensions,
and scupper' the hereditary principle, and
scramble on to some kind of representative
basis, it may renew its life, but regarded as
the biggest legislative absentee on earth
something requires to be done to it.
Sydney’s Labor aldermen, who are in pur-
suit of a coal mine or mines, have relieved
the monotony of the search by cancelling a
resolution to buy a British motor-car for the
End Mayor. On a previous occasion one of
them mentioned with artless candor that he
had a friend in the foreign motor-car business,
so the resolution was inconsistent with this
declaration and with the municipal Labor
party's general policy. A pity no cars are
being made in Russia. The council would
be a regular customer—other things being
equal.
STRENUOUS TIMES AHEAD.
“A Royal Commission is to inquire if and how Australian industry can provide the £22,000,000
which would be required for the Child Endowment scheme.”
THE BRUCE-PAGES : “Goosey, this is the size egg we leant you to lay, and this old
gentleman will decide whether your constitution can stand it.”
Melbourne Town-Planning Commission is
battling for the prolongation of its pre-
carious existence. The organisation costs
about £5OOO a year and makes an average
of six recommendations a week, any one of
which, if carried out, would save the con-
gested city tens of thousands in the years
to come ; but they are never put into effect.
Most of the opposition to the Commission
comes from suburbs like Richmond, where
the 20-foot frontage flourishes. The pathetic
body would do well to hand in its resignation
as a protest against its own powerlessness.
Asserting that the cost of the standard
of living, as fixed by himself, lias gone up
lOd. a week since December, A. B. Pidding-
ton, the N.S.W. Industrial Commissioner,
has increased the living wage for adult males
from £4 4s. a week to £4 55., and that for
adult females from £2 2s. to £2 6s. Under
the endowment scheme rushed through last
year married workers on the £4 ss. mark
will be entitled to an additional ss. per
week per child up to a maximum of £5 155.;
skilled workers who earn more wages will
get less endowment or none at all—they are
to be penalised, in fact, for being skilled.
And as the cost of living will inevitably be
shoved up still more to meet the tax on
industry, thousands of the State’s most use-
ful citizens will, in effect, have their wages
and salaries reduced. The endowment law
is supposed to come into force on July 1.
But Piddington’s arithmetic and Lang’s
arrangements and the attitude of the unions
are so, clouded with doubts that there will
be no' great surprise if the whole scheme
crashes and a new basic wage is declared
in a few months.
The dropsical star of Soviet Russia
seems to be sinking. At one time it was
thought the meddlers had taken complete
charge of the revolution in southern China,
and probably they thought so themselves.
But General Chiang Kai-shek and his friends
grew tired of them and began to make a
clearance. Now the few Bolsheviks who
hung on at Hankow have received permis-
sion to “leave the country on holiday.”
British trade-union leaders, who once viewed
the Soviet push with awe and admiration,
have expressed their disgust at the execution
of innocent people without trial for fear
guilty people should shoot: a Commissary or
two, and there is coolness all round.
Of two things Vic.’s new Labor Ministers
have become painfully aware: (1) that many
of their fellow-citizens are unblushing beg-
gars for subsidies; (2) that when a billet is
vacant, whether it be the Agency-General or
a registrarship of births and deaths, there
is no mock-modesty in applying. The Uni-
versity, members of Parliament, hospitals,
municipal councils, teachers, civil servants,
all want something, and the only way to
find the extra coin is to tax somebody—par-
ticularly somebody earning more than £7 a
week.
The U.S. has sent representatives to
Geneva to try to arrive at an agreement by
which it and the British empire shall be
limited to a certain and equal size and ton-
nage of war vessels, with Japan third, the
proportions being 5—5—3. J. Bull natu-
rally points out that if both countries were
effectively blockaded against foreign food
supplies the U.S. could hold out as many
centuries as the U.K. could weeks. The dif-
ference between 35 inhabitants to the square
mile and about 500 has a remarkable effect
on the food problem. Also blockade would
cut the Bull parent country off from 991 per
cent, of its empire, which might then be
lost by instalments, leaving only about
121,000 square miles. A similar catastrophe
wood sever Uncle Samuel’s motherland
from only about 20 per cent, of its empire,
and would leave it 2,973,776 square miles.
Japan shows no particular tendency to sign
Uncle’s agreement. It consists of 505 islands
and a bit of mainland with hostile neigh-
bors, and it thinks that a lot of sea defence
may be wanted some day. Perhaps it might
add: “Especially now that Uncle has come
to live next door.”
Old Jack West, M.H.R. for East Sydney,
has come out with a proposal for a Common-
wealth research institute, station and farm;
he would plant the thing on 20 square miles
of the Canberra territory. An annual research
congress and a triennial congress to which
outside scientists would be invited is part of
Jack’s scheme, and a million is suggested as
an endowment fund. One obvious drawback
is the Canberra climate. Soil analyses can
be made anywhere, but ’Berra temperatures
are considerably below the continental aver-
age. State Frighters will also protest that
the plan, if adopted, would be a move towards
Federal control of agriculture; but Federal
control of agriculture—sufficient, at least, to
prevent repetitions of the over-production fol-
lies committed under the six State regimes—
will have to come.
The Wireless Commission in Sydney has
been told that beam messages were received
well in U.S.A. when the ray was working
either way round the world to London.
There is a report that messages are being
picked up regularly in Japan as well. The
new method is cheap and useful in time of
peace; but for defence purposes the Com-
monwealth will have 1o stick to its expensive
cables until wireless has solved the problem
of lack of secrecy.
Priminister Bruce was flabbergasted when
Premier IJogan told the Federal-States fin-
ance conference how deeply Vic. was in the
mire on the financial side of its soldier-
settlement scheme. The Commonwealth.
Hogan said, had granted Victoria a sop of
£1,560,000, but that was no good; and he
asked Bruce to provide £387,000 a year for
30j- years to meet interest in excess of
5 p.c. and establish a sinking fund to ex-
tinguish the debt of £22,353,000. Even if
this were done, he added, Vic. would have
to furnish £315,000 a year for interest and
administrative expenses. Part of the scheme
is the writing down of liability to
£15,000,000. Hogan contended that Vic. was
merely the Commonwealth's agent in the
matter, and the other Premiers, who have
similar troubles (though the Diggers who
took up wheat-farms in Westralia have done
pretty well), nodded in sympathy. The con-
ference decided to make soldier-settlement
finance the main theme for the No. 2 session
it is to hold in Sydney on July 21.
A good deal has lately been written about
unemployment and acute distress in and
around Melbourne, and the executive of the
Trades Hall Council has taken the usual
simple and thick-headed course: —
Resolved: That we urge the State Ministry to
request the Prime Minister to take immediate steps
to stop the flow of migrants to Australia until a large
number of those already here have been absorbed in
useful employment.
While fleets of other people’s ships loaded
with what should be “useful employment''
for our own people come here from all parts
of the world with unfailing regularity it
is difficult to see where the relief is to come
from.
The Federal Cockies’ tariff resolution
reads: “That the Australian primary indus-
tries be safeguarded by legislation placing
them on a more equal footing with secon-
dary industries, and ensuring them against
competition detrimental to the White Aus-
tralia policy.” The Bulletin heartily agrees
that farm produce should be protected as
well as manufactured goods, but if the tariff
is not distributing its benefits fairly the
Cocky members are partly, if not chiefly, to
blame. There are import duties on butter
and substitutes, cheese, preparations of milk,
eggs in the shell, dry egg albumen, honey,
bacon and hams, poultry, fruits (fresh and
dried), many varieties of vegetables, barley,
maize, oats, wheaten flour, cornflour, oat-
meal, rice, hops, broom millet, nuts, seeds,
sugar, tobacco, wine, brandy, cider, perry,
and other articles produced, wholly or in
part, on farms. Such duties as are not
sufficiently protective can be made so when-
ever the Country party cares to move.
Members of Vic. Parliament are not
elated at going back to the old home in
Spring-street, as they felt comfortable in
their temporary establishment —the Rath-
down-street annexe of the Exhibition build-
ings. There was no stair-climbing, and
plenty of elbow-room. At the same time
there ought to be space enough for 99 mem-
bers where 143 in pre-Federation days used
to accommodate themselves. Whether the
nearness of Parliament House to the public
offices will increase departmental trotting
remains to be seen.
BLESSED IS HE—

“Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid
to a Labor leader is to find himself venomously
abused by all the anti-Labor factions in the country.”

The proletariat’s sacred rights to guard
When you observe, ’cause of the wrongs
you’re righting.
All other sections of the House uniting
To curse you hot and hard.
Such onslaughts hearten you and keep you
smiling
More than the warmest acclamations
could;
You justly take this orgy of reviling,
These imprecations on your head they're
piling,
As proof you’re making good.
When half your erstwhile followers, in
addition,
Still fiercer gibes and insults at you roar,
Consigning you to bottomless perdition,
You’ve tributes surely that no politician
Could ever boast before.
If truly blest is lie at whom the curses
From front and rear impartially hiss
And somebody from every side asperses,
You may thank Heaven for its crowning
mercies.
Yours must be Perfect Bliss !

“Windsor”: At last a Melbourne constable
has had a reliable test of sobriety sprung
upon him. Early the other morning he
stopped a driver who was proceeding along
Bourke-street in a series of eccentric spurts
and suspiciously asked him what lie had
been drinking. “The very best, constable,”
replied the motorist feelingly, “but I’m not
drunk.” The John took leave to doubt the
statement. “I’ll prove it,” said the driver,
springing out of the car. “Jos watch me.”
He then upended himself on his hands and
walked in that fashion to and fro along the
pavement fronting the Palace Theatre. Visi-
bly impressed by the test, the constable
stayed his hand; he even helped to pick up
all the money and keys which had trickled
out of the motorist’s pockets while he was
proving his innocence.

“C. Coral”: Several unsuccessful attempts
have been made at different times to locate
the records said to have been buried on
Possession Island by Captain Cook. There
is a story of a South Sea native, Avho was
working on the island at the time of the
gold-rush there, having found a bottle with
coins and papers therein; after examining
the contents, he replaced the bottle and
reported his find, but the place could never
be located again. There is also a persistent
tradition amongst the natives of Cowal
Creek (just opposite on the mainland) of
a bottle having been found on the top of
Dayman Island, close to Possession. Is it
possible that Cook placed his records on
Dayman and not on Possession? There is
another Possession Island with the prefix
“North” about 80 miles to the north-west,
where Blig'a landed and hoisted the colors
in 1792, taking possession of all the islands
in Torres Strait for his Britannic Majesty
George .111.

shared the same wire with several others.
Listening in as we know it hadn’t been in-

spare time at the instrument, absorbing any
conversations that drifted her way, and there-
by kept her boarders always supplied with
the latest news of the neighborhood. One
Sunday morning Little Mat and I blew in
to breakfast to be told, before the tea was
poured out: “My word. I gave that Susie
Tombs a knock last night.” As Susie lived
about 12 miles away it was obvious that the
missus was speaking figuratively and we de-
manded further details. “Yes,” she con-
tinued, “I just went to the ’phone and I
heard her talking to Mudd, the cane inspec-
tor at the mill. He says to her: ‘Tell me
about it now.* She says, ‘I can’t.’ He asks
her why, and she says, ‘Because Mother
Sudds is bound to be listening!”’ “My
oath !” commented Little Mat, sympatheti-
cally, “that was pretty rough. Missus. And
what did you say?” The victim of suspicion
hacked two slices off a 21b. loaf as viciously
as if they were bits of Susie before she fin-
ished impressively: “I says to her, I says,

“Momokeni”: I wonder where “Goose-
flesh” 18. 16/6/’27) got his idea -that the
Germans permitted mixed bathing* in the
nude at watering - places
on the Baltic. Whilst a
student at Heidelberg and
Jena, I spent a summer
vacation on the Baltic
coast, and never once did
I see or hear of such a
thing. I can guarantee
it was equally unknown
at the Swedish -watering-
places on Lake Maelar.
Outside Russia, the only
place in Europe where I
saw nude bathing in pub-
lic was at Cambridge,
England, where at the
’Varsity boatsheds on the
upper river the students
dispensed with trunks
and bathed in the buff,
calmly ignoring passing
canoes and rowing-boats.
II was considered bad
form to glance at that
side of the river when
passing. In Russia, of
course, they manage
things quite differently.
There I was often invited
to join the mixed throng
in the village vapor bath-
house, with a roll in the
deep snow outside as a
grand finale to the weekly debauch in cleanli-
ness.
“Loco”: Whatever doubts may be cast on
the efficiency of the emergency buttons in
N.S.W. trains (B. 16/6/’27) there- is no
argument over the Vic. communication cord.
This is connected with a tap on the Westing-
house brake air pipe. As soon as the cord
is pulled the tap is opened, the compressed
air escapes, and the brake is applied through-
out the train. The driver could not con-
tinue travelling very far even if lie went full
steam ahead. If somebody pulls the cord
“just for fun,” the compartment can be iden-
tified, for the cord will be hanging loose there.
If the cord is pulled while on a bridge or
other undesirable stopping place, the driver
may, by placing his brake handle in “re-
lease” position and working his pump hard
and his engine “full bore,” keep going, but
only for two or three hundred yards at most.
No sane driver starts on his journey without
making sure that his Westinghouse is con-
nected right through his train.
“Wang”: The deadbeat who received the
China eggs from a kindly housewife (!>.
16/6/’27) can hardly have been more dis-
gusted than the subject of this paragraph. A
few months ago a grocer in our suburb, who
was giving his place a general clean-up, sent
a cart-load of unwanted stuff, mostly dummy
food advertisements, to the local destructor.
As the vehicle was passing in front of my
office window a ham dropped off the back. A
minute or so afterwards I was mildly enter-
tained to see an eminently respectable citi-
zen walk over to the jetsam and, after looking
round to satisfy himself he was unobserved,
place it under his overcoat. Then he walked
rapidly away and left me rather envying him
his windfall. An hour or two later I chanced
to be over at the destructor, and was amazed
to see the stokers hurling several hams into
the furnaces. At least they looked like
hams, but investigation showed them to be
dummy bags filled with sawdust. I am still
wondering what the respectable citizen
thought when he dug into his spoil.

“Riverina”: George Bragg, a Stewart
Island (M.L.) resident, recently picked up
a bottle containing papers on the shore of
Doughboy Bay. Investigation showed that
it had been dropped overboard by Captain
Neville, of the, s.s. Wailiora, near Hobart, on
June 22, 1895, on behalf of the Brisbane
Weather Bureau, with the object of ascer-
taining tiie ocean drift from that part of
the Speck. The papers bore the signature
of The Bulletin’s old friend Clement L.
Wragge.

“Macess”: “The Berlin correspondent of
the Times states that the Steel Helmets.. . .
are taking action on the question of war
guilt. This organisation has drafted a bill,
which will be" presented to the Reichstag.
This provides penal servitude for Germans
and expulsion for foreigners who say that
Germany caused the war.”
“Kick anybody? God forbid!”—
Bill Bludgeon’s face was writhed in pain—

“I’ll use the boot again!”
UP-SIDE-DOWN-ADAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\Y lien I was very young indeed ’twas Man,
the Gay Deceiver,
Who cultivated “mutton-chops” or “Picca-
dilly weepers,”
And anyone who chaffed him or ejaculated
“Beaver”
Was likely to be treated to a pair of
“mourning peepers.”
My mother wore her hair in curls that
tumbled to her shoulders,
Or, later on. the bold chignon which
pleased the comic artist.
And father’s crop intrigued the most fastidi-
ous beholders;
Their friends said they were jiggered if
they knew which looked the smartest!
But in these days of “up-side-down” it natu-
rally follows,
When ladies smoke and drink and swear
and gentlemen “do pretty,”
When men make up like Venuses and women
like Apollos,
It's sometimes hard to tell the two apart;
and that’s a pity!
Still, as a rule, you won’t be wrong if, judg-
ing by contraries,
You come to the conclusion, when you
see a batch of friskers,
That those are boys whose locks arc long,
as once were Kate’s and Mary’s,
And all the other things are girls in imi-
tation whiskers.

“M.G.S.”: With the conver-
sion of H.M. Colonial Ship Pro-
tector into a lighter at Wil-
liamstown (Vic.), the last relic
of S. Australia’s Navy passes
into honorable retirement. As
a boy I was impressed every
morning with the Protector as
• the nation’s bulwark against the
Russian (he was the bogey man
in those days), because I could
see her from my bedroom win-
dow acquiring barnacles in
Largs Bay. Later on I became
editor, printer and producer of
a cliromographed monthly known
as the Semaphore Search-
light/ and though our circula-
tion was only 80 copies, when
the Protector sailed away to res-
cue the Legations from the
Boxers at Peking, she carried
our special representative in the
person of the gunner’s mate. His
despatches were somewhat dis-
appointing, being mainly de-
voted to the distressing sea-sick-
ness of the crew when they
struck a typhoon off Manila. The
calm waters of St. Vincent Gulf
had not prepared the jolly tars
for that sort of thing, and when
they did finally land a party in
China it was only to find that
a European contingent had got
in before them. They never even
joined in the looting of the Sum-
mer Palace at Peking. However,
they returned with a. memor-.
able achievement to their credit.
They coaled their little craft so
expeditiously in Hong Kong
that the admiral hoisted the sig-
nal “Well done!”
❖ ❖ ❖
“P.P.”: A curious matrimo-
nial adventure was outlined in a
recent case of child-stealing in
Sydney.. A woman who had
been a frequent customer in a
little shop was always admiring
the baby and one day offered to
help the busy mother by taking
the infant for a walk. She failed
to return and a distraught
mother was presently invoking
the assistance of the police, who
eventually retrieved the child,
which had been well cared for
in every way. The explanation
which the Court heard was that
the acquisitive lady had been
long separated from her hus-
band ; meeting him one day and
finding him not unwilling to
return to her, she played what
turned out to be a winning card
by informing him that he was a
father: her baby was boarded
out, but she could get it back at
any moment. Having invented
the baby she had to find one;
hence the kidnapping. The
Judge, while impressing on the
culprit the gravity and cruelty
of her offence, decided that
binding her over for 12 months
would be a sufficient penalty; thojigh
S’On ah didn’t say so, he probably hoped that
the exposure of the fraud hasn’t interfered
with the lady’s prospect of domestic happi-
ness.

“F.S.” : A little daylight was let into the
jury-squaring business as practised in Vic.
"'hen a contractor named McGaughay was
committed for trial at Camberwell for unlaw-
fully inciting Daniel McMichael to conspire
with him “to defeat the ends of justice.”
According to Daniel, who was due to stand
his trial for manslaughter arising from a
motor accident, he received an anonymous
letter asking him to call at a certain address.
There, according to his statement, he found
McGaughay, who proposed, in return for
a deposit of £25, to fix things for him with
the 12 good men and true. According to
the accuser, McGaughay showed him news-
paper cuttings and index-cards containing
records of previous successful operations and
instanced one case which cost £175, out of
which two jurymen had each received a
tenner and a third £5, while the rest went
in “expenses.” Eventually Daniel returned
with the deposit in marked notes lent him
by the police, who claim subsequently to
have discovered them in McGaughay’s pos-
session.
“Bihai”: “Bouragi” is behind the times
in his statement that Papuan mission natives
have to be content with “an inward glow
of satisfaction” in lieu of wages for their
labors for the Church (B. 26/5/’27). One
of the first cocoanut plantations in Papua
to pay its way is the property of a mission
society, and it is worked by natives under
contracts of service similar to those of
any secular company. In inspecting L.M.S.
schools I found the missionaries preaching
the gospel of indentured labor to their pupils.
The one and only objection the missionaries
have to it is the recruiting of too many boys
from any village at the one time, this tend-
ing to decrease the birthrate. A buffer is
never a popular person, and missionaries
often act as such between jnatives and those
who are only too ready to exploit them.
That such a buffer is necessary has been
abundantly shown by the Royal Commission
recently held in N.-YV. Australia.
“Nakhoda”: I don’t know whether there
are people who are impervious to malaria
(B. 16/6/’27), but I once lived on an island
where the entire white population thought
it was. The anopheles swarmed, but there
NOT MUCH RELIEF FOR THE POOR DONKEY.
“The British press applauds the new Sinking Fund .scheme of the Australian Government, and
believes that the provision for paying off old loans will make it easier to raise new ones on the English
loan, market.”— Cable.
JOHN BULL: “Ah, that’s right; unload some of the bricks and then I’ll be able
to pile the stones higher.”
hadn’t been a case of human infection as
far back as anyone could remember, which
moved the P.W.D. man, an ex-greaser, to
light his pipe with Governmental instruc-
tions re prevention and jeer scornfully at
the theories of Sir Ronald Ross. Then a
man arrived from the West Coast of Africa
who was filled with the pest, and within a
few weeks every white person was down
with it. The island has never been able
to shake it off since and never will until the
mosquito is suppressed. There is a moral in
this for cities like Sydney, which has the
anopheles in abundance and malaria sub-
jects arriving from the North by every boat.

“Ibn el Issar”: The northern-frontier
tribes who have long supplied British regi-
ments iii India with periodical occupation
and military training must be coming to
the conclusion that the sahib is losing his
sense of sportsmanship. A week or so ago
15(X) tribesmen crossed the border into the
Pesbawur district and attacked the frontier
posts. In the old days that would have
meant a local mobilisation and a campaign,
with presently a new medal for the expedi-
tion. All that was done this time was to
despatch 19 aeroplanes, which routed the
insurgents In a couple of days with bomb and
machine-gun fire, at no cost to the Sirdar but
the petrol bill. Even before this the hillmen
must have had an uneasy notion that times
were changing. During the Great War
Britain fenced off the border between the
Pesliawur district and the then insurgent
Mohmand territory with a barrier carrying
highly-charged electric wires. After a few
dozen Mohmands had been frizzled up trying
to crawl through at night, their comrades
lost their tempers and sent a message across
asking the sahibs to revert to their old prin-
ciple ot fair fighting and shut down on these
insidious and invidious modern contrivances.
The appeal fell on deaf ears, however, and
there was nothing left for the rebels but to
go home.
* * * *
“F.T.K.”: Consider the tough luck of
Sergeant Williams, of the First Division.
London born, he soldiered all his life, serving
for a long time in India and then in South
Africa. After the Boer War he joined up
with the French Foreign Legion. Obtain-
ing his discharge when the Great War broke
out, he crossed to Egypt and enlisted with
the Australian troops, regarding six bob a
day as preferable to the poorer pay of a
Tommy. His military experience soon won
him his three stripes and he served on the
Peninsula from the landing to the evacua-
tion. Next he found himself in a Cairo
Hospital, where it was soon discovered that
lie was an advanced t.b. Pie was boarded
promptly, and made frantic efforts to be
sent to England, but without success. To
Australia he had to come, although he knew
no soul in this country except the men with
whom he had served. His discharge soon
followed, and a few months later he died
in a N.S.W. country town. To the very last
he clung to the hope of seeing his homeland
again, but it was not to be.
* * * *
“Coot”: During the past few years the
Roman Catholic Church has acquired for edu-
cational and other purposes many stately
dwellings throughout Victoria besides
Rppertswood. Archbishop Mannix lives in the
imposing edifice erected by the late Henry
Wrixon in Ivew; the Chirnside man
sion at Werribee is now utilised by the
Corpus Christi College for the training of
priests; Mandeville Hall, Toorak, is a con-
vent ; Holyrood, John Higgins’s late resi-
dence at Camberwell, houses the Dominican
Fathers; and Studley Hall, Kew, has become
the preparatory school in connection with
Xavier College. In most instances the land
on which the buildings stand has increased
substantially in value since the purchase.
* * * *
“Windsor”: It is surely unusual for a per-
son who has unsuccessfully attempted self-
destruction to draw pointed attention to his
failure. A man staggered into the Ballarat
West police station the other day and an-
nounced gloomily that he had just tried to
commit suicide, exhibiting his drenched cloth-
ing as proof of his assertion. He added a
harrowing story of having waded out some
60 feet into Lake Wendouree in a vain search
for deep water. Finally he got so cold that
he decided not to drown himself after all.
A phlegmatic constable heard him out
patiently and then formally charged him with
offensive behavior.
* * *
“Lao-dah”: A quaint institution is the
Anti-Suicide Bureau, a branch of the Mel-
bourne Salv’army. Intending self-immolators
are encouraged to come and lay their griev-
ances against the world before the officer-
in-charge. On e turned up the other dav
with self-destruction in his aspect, but five
minutes’ conversation changed his mind.
Then lie disgorged enough lethal weapons
and potions to serve a regiment of prospec-
tive suicides. They went into the bureau’s
museum, while their erstwhile owner went
to the Prison-Gate Home at Abbotsford.

“1.D.”; While in Darwin last March 1
visited the public school and was horrified to
see little white girls sitting cheek by jowl
with Chinese boys and half-castes of all
kinds. In one instance there was a solitary
girl in a class of boys. I asked who was
responsible, and was told that it was an idea
of one of the inspectors, who wished to give
the Chinese every chance of becoming Aus-
tralianised. What about the Australian
youngster’s chance of becoming Orientalised 7
* * *
“Elgar”: Among the cranks who pervade
Melbourne is one whom nobody seems to
have ever succeeded in identifying. For quite
20 years he has been wandering round
after dark with a paint-brush and
a bucket of lime-wash and adorning
fences, rockeries, blank walls and such
like with the single and solemn
word “Eternity,” always
scrawled in the same fist. What
purpose he thinks is served
thereby nobody knows but him-
self ; it seems a shocking waste
of lime as well as time. Another
- —or it may be the same-
cheerful idiot periodically sticks
on the walls of lavatories little
pieces of paper bearing the some-
what hackneyed statement “God
is Love,” but as the gum he
uses is washy stuff, the informa-
tion drops off almost as soon as
it is stuck on.
:!=
“0. Coral”: A party of pic-
nickers sailing round Endeavour
Strait the other day came across
a small cave at Port Lihou (on
the south side of Prince of
Wales Island), wherein were
stored some painted skulls,
doubtless relics of the head-
hunting days of half a century
ago. The Prince of Wales
Islanders were a bloodthirsty
lot, as several shipwrecked
crews discovered to their cost.
Near where these relics were
found is the grave of a white
woman who was one of their
victims. In 1869, her husband’s
ship, lying at anchor near Fri-
day Island, was attacked by the
natives, and the two Europeans,
with their son and a Chinese
crew, were taken to Prince of
Wales Island, where it is be-
lieved that all except the woman
were killed immediately. A
cutter*, the Lizzie Jardine, re-
turning from a periodical trip
to Booby Island, where she left
stores for shipwrecked mariners,
saw a canoe on the beach with a
coil of new rope and a log-book
therein. Information was taken
to Somerset, and a search-party
was organised from native police
and crews of ships which were
after beche-de-mer in Torres
Strait. Landing at Port Lihou
under cover of darkness, they
found the natives engaged in a
big dance round the camp-fires,
with the woman still alive in
their midst. The position was
rushed at dawn, but the unfor-
tunate woman had just died.
Summary vengeance was exe-
cuted on the natives, and a
great slaughter took place.
X ❖ ❖
“Strict Veg.” : The other Sun-
day a Melbourne motorist appro-
priately named Spry recognised
a passing car on the Beach road
as one which had been stolen
from a friend. Accosting the
youth (plus girl) in temporary
command he got evasive answers,
and no policeman being handy,
it looked as if he would be com-
pelled to see the suspected
thieves slip away. Just at that
moment Spry’s brother chanced
along; whereupon the two con-
ceived the plan of blanketing
the stolen car along the crowded
road until they reached a police-
station. Ranging themselves
one on each side, they shepherded the
young man into Elwood, 10 miles away.
Every time the fugitive attempted to turn
up a side street, one of the Sprys interposed
an insistent bonnet, and every time he tried
to shoot ahead they were just a wheel in
front of him. The angry clamor of about
a million motorists, anxious to cut in from
behind on the three cars, did not shake
the purpose of the brothers, and finally,
by skilful coaxing, they forced their quarry
up a narrow drive to a service-station where
they nabbed him.
Hs sjs >!:
“Feng-Shui”: Touching immunity from
malaria. Millions of natives occupying the
damp tropical islands to the north of Aus-
tralia are impervious to the sort of malaria
the white man suffers from. Centuries of
infection from A. quadriniaculatris has appa-
rently made them tolerant of their host-,
just as a Scotsman is tolerant of whisky and
a Dutchman of gin. I have seldom seen a
Malay in the grip of a genuine ague, but.
whereas a white man may be playing tennis
a few hours after an attack, the native will
remain in a state of somnolent subjection to
the disease from the cradle to the ghat. And
surely this is natural, since the severity of
the symptoms are a measure of the body’s
resistance to the assault.
THE HUM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Pozieres and Passcliendaele,
Moquet Farm and Poelcapelle—
All your stories, lad, are stale,
Find some newer tales to tell.
Find a fresher dish to serve,
Try some more arresting plea;
Empty sleeve and broken nerve
Long since lost their piquancy.
Once men paused to take your hand,
Men were proud to call your name.
Can’t you, won’t you, understand,
You have long outlived your fame?
In your eyes a wondering stare,
Puzzled lines upon your brow.
Ah! it’s far from Pozieres,
And your glass is empty now.
Once the hero of the batt.,
First across the parapet,
Now you’re merely part of that.
Which the world would fain forggt.
Hide your empty sleeve away,
Weak the market now for flesh,
And the gaping crowd to-day
Ever turns to something fresh.
Mouquet Farm and Po-
zieres—
These must suffer their
eclipse,
Who cares now if you were
there
When the nations stood at
grips ?
Who cares now for Pass-
chendaele
Or to hear of Poelcapelle?
Lad, your stories all are
stale.
Find some newer ones to
tell.

THUMP! Down dumps a ton or so of rocks and clay.
Thump! Down it comes again. So the relentless steam
shovel vomits forth its load. This goes on day in, day
out —sometimes for 24 hours on end.
Surely it is the test. Only the Truck with the frame—
the axles and the springs that have been built for the job
will operate at a profit. Therefore, it must pay to buy
not a Truck for a price, but engineering for a value.
Since 1875 Brockway have been building Commercial
Waggons.
Experience—years of it —is being offered to the Truck
user in the Brockway machine —stalwart Springs—Radius
Rods—quality Frame Construction —in fact all the out-
standing features you must have and which you won t
find in most jobs of to-day.
Study the picture below. Here is a masterpiece in
Brockway Engineering skill—a real Truck a ruggedly
strong job—a profit-earning machine excellent in work-
manship—si job built for the work, NOT to a price.

“J A. Caranda”: Mary Manus, a dainty
little bit of colored Dresden, had taken for
better or for worse, mostly worse, one Tarbo, a
lazy, plausible rascal, employed at th e Pub-
VICTIMS OF A NATURAL LAW.
“Goodness! Fancy the FitzBasins
being divorced. They took their
marriage so seriously.”
“Yes, they fell out from sheer force of gravity.”
lie Works Department, Rabaul. Tarbo’s
duties took him away from home for several
days, and the young bride sobbed bitterly
as she resigned herself to a separation, how-
ever brief. However, Kalapoi, a cobber of
Tarbo’s, assisted to lighten Mary’s loneliness
with such success that upon Tarbo’s return
a complaint was laid before the O.C. Police
and Kalapoi was duly sentenced to receive
10 fella strokes and to pay a fine of 10s.
. to Tarbo by way of compensation for his
interference with the latter’s domestic bliss.
With the 10s. Tarbo bought a pig, fattened
and killed it, then gave a feast to which
Kalapoi was invited as an honored guest.
Thus is the eternal triangle squared—in
New Guinea. <
“The Amateur Gentleman” : Which is the
most cosmopolitan city in Australia? I
nominate Broken Hill, where representa-
tives of every European nation and quite a
number of Asiatic ones may be found. In
South Broken Hill there are about 1000
Southern Europeans, mostly Jugo-Slavs and
Italians, and in the town itself, notably at
the rear of the main street, are whole colo-
nies of Greeks and Maltese. When an
operatic company visits the Barrier adver-
tisements in English and Italian appear in
the local papers, and one enterprising tailor
has begun to advertise his wares in English.
Croatian or Jugo-Slav and Maltese.
“Oilskin”: A particularly thick-skinned
impostor was haled before the Melbourne
City Court the other day for drawing a war
pension to which he wasn’t entitled. It was
shown that he had bluffed Repat. with a
bogus gunshot wound (a facial depression
left by an abscess) and drawn a pension
from 1918 onwards. What made the fraud
more remarkable is that the pension was
reviewed from time to time, which meant
that the alleged wound was repeatedly passed
by the doctors. It further came out in
evidence that the impostor (he belonged to
the 13th reinforcements, 7th Battalion) had
evaded his battalion and managed to dodge
service from the jump to the finish. Prior
to being handed three months for fraud he
shed copious tears in the dock. In most
armies, on the same record, lie would have
had a poor chance of escaping a firing-party
"C.Q.” : The hero who drags his exhausted
companion through the snowdrift is familiar
to every cinema-goer, but the real thing
has been done by Frank Spargo, inspector
of the patrol cottages in Victoria’s Alps. lie
and his assistant left Hotham Heights for St.
Bernard Hospice the other day on skis and
struck a terrific snowstorm. Coming back
the assistant collapsed, and the other man,
after vainly struggling to support his friend
on the long boots, discarded them and
tramped through the snow. Spargo can
almost smell his way in the dark, and he
reached the Diamantina hut eventually with
a half-dead mate. It took him six hours to
do the four miles.
“Arthur R.”: General Blarney is out to
improve the marksmanship
of the Victorian police;
every member of the force
has to spend some hours each
week in revolver practice at
l lie range adjacent to the old
Russell-street gaol. The tests
have shown that a few of the
men are expert shots, but
with the great majority Bill
Sikes would have something
more than a sporting chance.
“Centurion” : Some recent references in the
Sydney dailies to the “Angel of Durban”
prompt me to ask who it is that bestows
such titles on kind-hearted women who have
done great tilings for soldiers in war-time.
Miss Campbell, this particular “angel,” was
held in high regard and esteem by the num-
erous Diggers to whom she acted as hostess
HE KNEW WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM.
“Put him outa your mind, Becky. Since he heard that gentlemen prefer blondes he
won’t look at broonettes.”
and guide when the transports touched at
Durban. Yet one ventures to assert that not
one or those hard-bitten youths ever even
thought of his benefactress in terms of angels,
while certainly none would have given the
maudlin sentiment words. The journalistic
trick is as old as it is sloppy. It began, in
modern days, with Florence Nightingale. No
one in his senses imagines that the army per-
sonnel of that day referred to that great-
hearted woman as ‘‘The Lady of the Lamp”
or “The Angel of Scutari”—titles fastened on
her by a press then less given to blithering
than now. In the South African War a
titled lady who ran a “society” hospital ship
was paragraphed as the “Angel” of something
or other. What the maddened Atkinses pri-
vileged to experience society ministrations
called her and her ship, rty pen, like that
of Miss Squeers, would blush to repeat.
“Lao-dah”: There was an echo the other
day of something that happened during the
march of the U.S. sailors through Melbourne
two years ago, when a verandah
in Bourke-street collapsed with
its human load upon the layer of
spectators underneath. An elderly
onlooker who took a considerable
portion of the onslaught on his
head claimed £3OOO from the
verandah owners, Hoyt’s Pty.
(not the same co. as Hoyt’s
Theatres), and the jury awarded
him £l5OO, which should deter
people who own verandahs from
allowing them to be used as
grandstands. How quickly and
completely the accident was for-
gotten was shown during the late ducal visi-
tation, when half the shaky shop-eyelids in
the city were packed with people.
“T.R.H.”: The reason why there are so
few sleepers-out in Melbourne (B. 16/G/’27)
is that there are many more cheap doss-
houses there than in Sydney. One lodging-
house in Little Bourke-street provides accom-
modation for several hundreds at Bd. per
night; the Salvation Army in Latrobe-street
accommodates several more hundreds at 4d.
per night. In addition there are several mis-
sions which hand out free bed-tickets for
all sorts of cheap doss-houses. In Sydney
prices are substantially higher, though the
Salvation Army has ‘an eightpenny doss-
house in Foster-street. But the Sydney cli-
mate makes sleeping-out far less of a hard-
ship than it is in Melbourne.
“Almanac”: The Salvo officer’s who found
only two dossers-out in Melbourne parks and
open spaces during three nights (B. 16/t>/'27)
couldn’t have looked very closely. Aoout a
month ago I happened to go through some
of these potential sleeping-places at day-
break and I found the results harrowing.
In one corner of Royal Park four men were
sleeping on and under newspapers; a fifth
was luckier in having an ancient bran-bag
for bed-clothes. Richmond Park panned out
four in similar case, and Fawkner Park
seven. In the Domain I came on two, and
near the Yarra four sleepers were huddled
under a tarpaulin. Any railway man on
night duty can tell you of scores who find
night quarters in horse-boxes and cattle-
trucks, and there are more for whom a rail-
way platform provides a room o’ nights. And
my experience has convinced me that very
few of these men want charity; all that
they ask for is work.
“G.F.M.”: Talking of street names, the
Sydney suburb of Epping is surely the most
robustly English in Australia. The place
itself is generally understood to have been
christened because of some real or fancied
resemblance to Epping Forest, near London.
The principal streets are all named after
English counties, viz., Dorset, Surrey, Somer-
set, Derby, Chester, Pembroke. Essex, Oxford.
Cambridge, Norfolk, Sussex, York and Kent.
The adjoining suburb, Eastwood, may claim
the distinction of being the most martial in
the Commonwealth. Its thoroughfares com-
memorate the battles of Agincourt, Vimiera,
Balaclava, Sebastopol, Alexandria, Culloden.
Crimea, Abuklea, Khartoum, Corunna,
Waterloo and Alma.
* * * *
“Riwaka”: The streets in one part of Kew
(Vic.) are. named after notable Victorian
judges, vis., Willis, Barry, Fellows,
a’Beckett, Stawell and Molesworth. In most
cases the Christian name has been utilised
for a second label.

“XS” : The colloquial Australian ! Asked
what he had been doing in the country, a
witness in a Melbourne case replied “Digging
mud-oranges.” “And what are they?” asked
the magistrate. “Spuds, of course,” said the
witness scornfully.
THE KISS OF JUBILATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"The co-respondent admitted having- occasionally
kissed the respondent, but added that they were
merely ‘snap’ kisses and she sometimes resented them.
.... The respondent deposed that the co-respondent
had kissed her when he was excited, as he was apt
to be when his football team, Collingwood, won a
match.... The C.J. found misconduct had not been
proved.”
He kissed her —parenthetically, whether
’Twas strictly right is not for me to say.
It didn't mean a thing or matter a feather;
When lips touch lips real passion to convey
The couple's spirits, too, will rush together,
Tis obvious, in the Tennysonian way.
These snap salutes that sometimes left her
snappy
Just served to indicate that he was happy.
lie kissed her now and then —not hotly,
madly,
As an impetuous Lothario would.
But merely as a chap will whistle gladly
When Fortune smiles on him and things
go good.
Twas an expression of contentment, sadly
And most outrageously misunderstood
By persons apt to place a wrong construction
On almost any sort of labial suction.
Tot homines —so many ways of showing
Glee at some glad event or pleasant scoop.
While one his hat into the air is throwing
Another will emit a smothered whoop,
A third betake him where the beer is flowing.
Intent on shouting for a goodly group.
For him all such expedients lacked attraction
As means or registering satisfaction.
He might have started hip-hurraying
In moments of exceptional delight,
Or danced a pas dc seul, or fall’n to playing
The giddy ox some other way—too right!
He might have turned some handsprings, no
gainsaying,
Or stood upon his head —of course he might,
lie didn’t, finding kissing more congenial,
And surely in the circs, ’twas just as venial.
He kissed her merely on occasions glorious,
Such as the days of Collingwood’s success.
Ah! why are folk so cruelly censorious
-Vs to mis-read a jubilant caress?
And why were Collingwood so oft victorious?
For otherwise he might have kissed her
less.
lie kissed her, but ’twas only as a sister
Who has to share fraternal joys he kissed her.

The disclosed profit was well under the
record of the previous year. On that occa-
sion inner reserves amounting to £lOO,OOO
were brought to light, which added lustre to the
achievement. Last year a matter of £143,420,
being surplus on realisation and on maturity
of Government and other securities, gave a
nice lift to reserves, which also benefited by
£75,857 —balance after the payment of divs.
At the 1920 meeting Chairman George Elliot
announced that a long-term loan department
was to be created with a capital of
£1,406,250, and the bank would have power
to raise debentures to three times that
amount. The branch was started during
the term and the balance-sheet shows
£374,197 of capital in the department, of
which only £97,900 had been placed at March
31. Loans are to be at 0 p.c. with currency
up to 301 years. The “C” long-term mort-
gage shares (issued to the M.L. Government)
bear 0 p.c. and the “D” 7£ p.c. p.a. Two
years ago an extra £1,125,000 of new capital
was raised. It was advanced to the Govern-
ment for a period of 10 years at 51 p.c. for
use of the Advances to Settlers’ Department.
Over that period the bank will have to find
the difference between that and the div.-rate
—now 141 p.c. The long-term mortgage
department is, of course, a matter of un-
certainty. It will be an achievement if the
bank can add much to profits from this
branch. The facts that inner reserves were
brought into the light in, 1924 and 1926 and
that substantial profits realised on the sale
of securities have been disclosed are fairly
definite intimations that the management is
completely satisfied that its provision for
contingencies is ample.
The M.L. Government’s connection with
the Bank of N.Z. dates back to the ’nineties,
when Dick Seddon saved the bank by advanc-
ing it £2,ooo,ooo—the £529,988 of 4 p.c.
guaranteed stock is the reminder of that inci-
dent. Its interest, apart from the stock, now
consists of the £500,000 of 10 p.c. non-cum.
“A” prefs. and £1,375,000 of “B” prafs.
(under an arrangement, these receive the
same as ordinaries). The Government shared
in the 50 p.c. bonus issue in 1921; its portion
was £375,000. In divs. it received last year
£231,250, plus the amount it took of the
£350,740 paid out in rates and taxes. The
utilisation of the bank in the matter of
advances to settlers and long-term mortgage
loans suggests that the last has been heard
for a long time of Government purchase.

*Less provision for contingencies.
Lessened exchange business must ha ve played
a part in the diminished earnings, for the
B.N.Z. does probably 7.7 p.c. of the exchange
business of the Dominion. Expenses were
heavier, but as the bank is still expanding
throughout the Dominion, and as its activi-
ties are widening, this is to be expected.
Taxation was a shade lighter, the decrease
being the fifth in line. Liabilities and
assets make the following comparisons:—

The decrease in deposits is symptomatic;
with the exception of 1922 they are at
the lowest point in the last 10 years.
Advances show the opposite movement; the
increase over the 12 months was £1,262,283,
the figure being inferior only to those regis-
tered in the peak years of the post-war boom.
However, the bank’s position was extraordi-
narily strong: total funds at March 31
amounted to £10,138,840, while outside liabili-
ties totalled £37,445,882. The bank therefore
held only £3 13s. lid. of the public’s money
for each £1 of its own funds —far below
what it could be without nearing the safety
limit. And, despite the diminution, the
proportion of outside liabilities held liquid
was 63.8 p.c., much in excess of necessities.
The balance was covered by the advances,
and by premises in at £520,877. Four years
ago premises were in the books at “nearly
three-quarters of a million less than the land-
tax valuation.”
Maoriland isn’t having a very happy time.
Imports for the 12 months ended March
31 were lighter than for the previous year,
but they were in excess of exports by 2}
millions. Worse, though, than that is an
exodus of North Island farmers from blocks
mortgaged to the hilt. There is warning to
finance cos. in the fact that in many cases
only sufficient has been realised to cover the
first mortgage. The South Island is fairly
free of trouble, though the over-capitalised
freezing industry is still making heavy
weather. That Maoriland needs to take a
pull in expenditure, particularly on luxuries,
is evident. As the management—four direc-
tors are appointed by the M.L. Government,
two elected by shareholders —has been promi-
nent. in pointing out the danger attending
the inflation in land values, and the neces-
sity of limiting expenditure so as to maintain
a favorable trade balance, it is unlikely that
it has neglected to provide for the contingen-
cies which it has so clearly foreseen. The
ordinary shares are worth £3 on the market,
at which price they yield under 5 p.c. There
have been such choice pickings in the past
that the shares are strongly in favor; and
the fact that Australian income-tax is not
collected on the dividends of the co. adds
to the value of investments in R.N.Z. shares.
There may, of course, be further issues of
shares at par; but profits will have to be
a good deal better to justify them. Last year’s'
dividends took 91 p.c. of the visible profit.

Tli£ increase in the div. rate surprised the
market, which had decided that the 8 p.c.
would continue for some time. Certainly, 2
p.c. was labelled bonus. The question is
being asked: Is it wise? In the circum-
stances, one glances at the management. The
directors are men who know the business
from the. inside. They are hardly likely to
have recommended the extra 2 p.c. for the
half-year had they not been completely satis-
lied. On the other hand, the solid figure
at which goodwill appears in the accounts —-
£118,074 —cuts the accumulations to a tiny
sum compared with paid capital of £600,000.
In the introductory table reserves included
are: General reserve, £150,193; leasehold,
£502; contingencies, £4000; and unappro-
priated balance, £527. In addition, there is
a taxation reserve of £23,966—drawn on for
xjl3s during the half-year. Some profit may
be hidden there, seeing that “provision for
taxation” is made a direct charge against
the half-year’s earnings. Depreciation is
also charged, probably on the liberal side.
Gross profits for the six months were £4744
less than in the preceding term, and a few
hundreds less than at March, ’26. The
directors nevertheless report that “business
during the half-year made consistent pro-
gress. and the resultant profit is satisfac-
tory.” Expenditure was cut back by £2306,
but still was £1346 greater than ' for the
corresponding half of 1925-26. Putting the
two statements together, it looks as though
there is nowadays a larger turnover but less
profit in it.
Balance-sheet movements were distinctly
in the right direction:—

Mortgages were only a shade lighter, but
the bank overdraft was cut down by a sub-
stantial sum and sundry creditors further
reduced by £15,356. The expansion in the
premises item was due to the completion of
the Brisbane warehouse and the alterations
made to the Adelaide building. Of £lOO,OOO
of new capital raised in 1925-26 the greater
portion has gone into premises. Freeholds
represent more than a third of capital, but
they appear in the books at a conservative
figure, and the management has been credited
with looking at the stock with a cautious
eye. Sundry debtors were reduced by more
than £50,000. The 100,000 prefs. have no
fear as to their 8 p.c. and the half-million
ordinaries can be given 10 p.c. without
effort, judged by recent profits. It is not
so long since the position was far from
comfortable, and although the co. has done
remarkably well since, continued attention to
reserves is still necessary. Latest sales were
at 28s. 3d.

Considering the restricted area in which the
co. operates, the expansion is surprisingly
good. Much of its territory is becoming
industrialized, and that is an important fac-
tor. The co. started in 1908 and subse-
quently branched out into the western
suburbs under franchises which still have
from 15 to 40 years to run. The big City
Council enterprise covers the surrounding
territory, and service within the present
areas appears to be the co.’s limit. Although
its charges are controlled by law, or by
agreement with municipalities outside Bal-
main, the co. has shown consumers the
utmost consideration. In 1925, for instance,
Justice Campbell, as a Royal Commissioner,
found that a reduction of price was not
justified. Later in the year, however, it
became evident that reduction was possible
and of its own accord the co. cut back its
prices. And in August of last year it again
voluntarily reduced rates by one-tenth of a
penny. The co. is under bond to give the
municipalities covered by its franchises treat-
ment equal to that given by the City Council
to its customers, which means on the one
hand a definite restriction as to charges, and
on the other, since the management’s desire is
to maintain the div. at 10 p.c., an incentive
to economical working. These figures show
its progress from another point of view :

Fixed assets increased by £68,140 —£14,574
of it was in plant and machinery and
£39,849 in mains and services. The amount
written off for depreciation of plant and
machinery was £27,700, compared with
£26,150 in 1926. The provision looks liberal
and the depreciation reserve of £167.292
sufficient. The co. is doing all that it is
required to do, and more; and its activities
are not likely to have legislative interference
so long as the management is maintained
at its present quality. The £1 paid shares
are steady at about 335., at which pric>
they show a return of 6 p.c. The return
is not glittering, especially in view of the
fact that the value of net visible and tangible
assets is only about 215.; but past issues
of shares have been at par, and there is
always the possibility of historv repeating
itself. _

Net premium income (that is, premium
income after deducting re-insurances) in
1925 was £26,055, in 1926 £50,820 and last
year £53,027. The growth is good. The loss
rate, however, though still favorable, is
moving fast the wrong way. In the co.'s
first year it was 16 p.c.; in 1924, 33 p.c.:
1925, 23 p.c.; 1926, 33 p.c.; last year, 35.2
p.c. Costs, considering that the co. was
formed more or less under the wing of the
Vie. Auto. Club, are high. They are not to
be arrived at with the greatest accuracy and
certainty, but apparently they were about
70 p.c. in 1924 and over 60 p.c. in 1926;
last year’s were 45 p.c. With the increase
in the business the old loss rate is not likely
to he achieved ; rapid growth .of motor transit
must inevitablv increase the risks to cars
and to dll traffic. No complaint can he made,
therefore, on the score of increased loss-
rate. But costs are too high. The directors,
nevertheless, remark that they could have
done much more business if they had been
prepared to buy it. If the expenditure of
nearly half the premium to get it is reckoned
cheap business, there is something rotten
with this motor-insurance trade.
New premises, remodelled and added to,
now house the enterprise. That portion of the
building -not used by the co. was “well let"
for the full term, but the accounts do not
disclose the amount received in rentals. The
position was improved during the year, gilt-
edged securities {plus accrued interest) in-
creasing by ±SOOO-odd to £30,281. Other
assets were cash and deposits, £6OOS; free-
hold, £36,973; sundry debtors, £13,650; and
field and office equipment written down to
£3700. _ Stationery should be written out; it
shouldn’t appear in the balance-sheet of a
concern which pays S p.c. divs. Liabilities
totalled £35,433 —-£18,000 owing on the free-
hold; £13,407 sundry creditors; and £4026
claims outstanding. The balance-sheet is
clear of intangibles. But it is doubtful
whether the reserve for unexpired risks is
sufficient; if it isn’t, then the profits claimed
to have been made have not been made. Capi-
tal increased during the year by £2155: at
April 30 there were 5000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 24,810 ordinaries, all £1 shares paid to
10s. A premium of 2s. was imposed on an
issue made during the term.

The transfers to capital have not drained
reserves, which still are greater than paid
capital, so that total funds have to earn
only a shade more than 7 p.c. to pay the
present 15 p.c. div. Needless to say, the
scrip is well held. At the end of April
£7222 was owed to the bank, and, as usual,
a heavy amount —£92,843 —of outside money
was being used, mostly in connection with
trust estates. This Column has hitherto had
a word or two to say on the co.’s practice
of listing “debentures” as an asset without
indicating their nature. It now shows the
amount as Government debentures, £10,350;
“local body,” £9200. Mortgages and deposits
are in at £28,425; premises, etc., £6568.

The investor is well supplied with lists
which show him what dividends the cos.
named therein are paying and what the re-
turn will be on the market price. But there
is another very important point—the amount
of net assets behind each share. In the
Wild Cat Monthly to be published on Sat-
urday a list will be found supplying this in-
formation, and investors will find it a valu-
able assistance in deciding what stocks
should be bought or sold. In addition there
will be the usual reviews of companies and
stocks; the mining section will include much
information regarding Malayan tin cos.; the
“Business Biography” of the month will be
devoted to Farmer and Co. (Sydney) ; and
in “Points for Investors” an attempt is
made to ascertain the basis on which share
investments should be effected. The

Since Hampton Plains (W.A.) boom pro-
spectors consider the chance of receiving Cash
or marketable scrip from option-seekers by
way of deposits for leases about on a par
with that of drawing a winner jn Tatts. How-
ever, Hughes and Moreton, owners of the
Glenelg Queen, are not doing badly in this
way. In the first instance they received from
Jack McDermott £4OO plus proceeds of gold
won from the treatment of trial parcels of
ore; then, on the show being returned to
them, they handed it to the Monte Carlo Co.
for £5OO cash as deposit plus a bundle of
Monte Carlo scrip. On June 15 they were
paid a further £l5OO on account of purchase
consideration.

Sons of Gwalia Co. (W.A.) decided the
other day to fire most of its hands, pick the
eyes out of what is left in the mine and
clear out. Since then the State Labor Gov-
‘ernment has promised to advance £5OOO to
tide over immediate difficulties and will give
further financial assistance later on. The
Gwalia was the one Westralian gold mine not
embraced in the damnatory clauses of the
Development and Migration Commission’s
report. On the contrary, the Technical Com-
mittee, on whose expert investigations the
Commission’s report was based, was quite
complimentary to the management. The
Gwalia plant and equipment, both surface
and underground, were declared to be
efficient and the management economical. In
this encomium the Technical Committee fol-
lowed Kingsley Thomas, who, reporting as a
Royal Commissioner a couple of years ago,
held up the Gwana as a shining example to
“wasteful and extravagant” companies of the
Golden Mile. To date the Gwalia has pro-
duced nearly £6,000.000 worth of gold and
paid £1.128.488 in dividends. There is still
much gold left in the mine, and with the
promised State assistance the show looks
more valuable than the present price of
shares suggests.

Dr. Keith Ward, Director of Mines in
S.A., has shot to pieces the prospects of
obtaining petroleum by deepening the bore-
hole of the Southern Ocean Oil Co. in the
vicinity of Kingston (S.A.). This was the
only hole drilled for oil at Kingston after
Tom Whaley failed to strike oil in a hole he
drilled for a Brisbane syndicate starting in
1913 and leaving off in 1914. Ward inspected
the hole last March and found it had reached
1760 feet, and now reports that it was
proved a dud at 484 feet from the surface
and ought to have been abandoned. The
rock is pre-Cambrian, of an age not known
to carry commercial supplies of petroleum
in any part of the world. Moreover, the
steep inclination of the grey limestone beds
between 484 and 1760 feet indicates disloca-
tion fatal to the occurrence of oil. No
geological survey was made to find out a
proper structure for the accumulation and
retention of petroleum. It was a blind stab
on level country lacking domal or anticlinal
structure. Ward advises the stoppage of
boring. So much for another drilling failure
achieved through pure ignorance. The trouble
is that these repeated blunders hurt the
raising of capital for bona fide sui’veying
and drilling for oil.

There is more than a touch of pathos in
the account of a meeting of Rockhampton
and Mount Morgan citizens called to urge
Federal aid in keeping the great mine alive.
Prime Minister Bruce is to be requested
to grant a bonus on copper and gold pro-
duced, “with a view to preserving the virile
mining population.” A bonus on production
of this type is simply robbing Peter to pay
Paul. As to the virile mining population—
well, it is no carping to say that it has
itself been no slight influence in the demise
of the once-golden goose, since it forced im-
possible wage rates.

Prospects for the reopening of the Jumna
mine, near Irvinebank (Q.), are promising.
Fred Reid, of Chillagoe, has the option on
behalf of a northern syndicate, and driving
on the 100 ft. level has disclosed a strong
body of ore going underfoot, samples from
which have prospected from 3 to 10 p.c. The
bottom of the underlay shaft is in 3 p.c. ore.
A trial crushing is being taken out, and if it
is satisfactory a battery will be erected at
the mine.

The Ouartette dredging lease, on the
lower Severn, below Stanthorpe (Q.), has
been sold by Joe Dempsey and Jim Mann to
a Brisbane co. Geologist St. Smith reported
on this area prior to going to Burmah. Of
an area of 100 acres he reckoned that 30
acres could safely be estimated to carry 70
tons of recoverable tin, with probably fur-
ther payable areas in depressions near the
river banks. The co.—Birch Tin, Ltd. —in-
tends starting operations next month and is
installing a Hughes alluvial concentrator as
well as a sluicing outfit. Bucket dredging
is out of the question.
The preliminary reports of Dr. Jensen on
the Mt. Spurgeon and Mt. Molloy alluvial
tin deposits (N.Q.) have been sufficiently
favorable to attract Brisbane investors.
Options have been secured over approxi-
mately 500 acres in these districts. Areas
sampled run 21b. tin. Investigations are
still in progress and finality as to ground to
be treated and values has not yet been
reached.

Queensland’s gold yield for May was bet-
ter than for May, ’26; but most of the
increase was due to Morgan’s recovery from
dump residues. Still, there has been a small
increase in production from alluvial and
reefing finds. From January 1. to May 31
73060 z. valued at £31.034 was won. an in-
crease over the corresponding 1926 period
of 36950 z. and £15,696.

“Northerner” on a recent “new” find: —
The gold-reef find reported (B. 26/5/’27) from
the outskirts of the old Palmer aluvial field is an
old friend, the property of Bob Dowell, on the Dain-
tree, five miles from the Lode Hill tin mine. A
small rush took place there about two years ago.
Men who have worked on reefs up here all their
working days believe Dowell has a good thing. He
has been prospecting the show for years. The area
has nothing in common with the Palmer. It is
70 miles due south from Cooktown, on the divide
of the Roaring Meg and Bloomfield Rivers, well
watered but covered with dense jungle. Arrange-
ments were made some months ago for the State
battery at Charters Towers to crush five tons of stone,
but I do not know whether that was done. A report
by Walter Colley should now be available.

Toonalook, a lode-tin show near Mullen-
gandri, in the Riverina, reports payable ore
in a gossan formation 6ft. wide between
slate walls. Five tons at grass is estimated
to go 3J p.c. and three tons from the cap-
ping 9 p.c. A big outcrop is now being
opened on, and a bunchy lode formation has
been proved off and on for 1000 feet. How-
ever, the proof will lie in the battery re-
turns, and a parcel is now being forwarded
for treatment.

The annual report of Maoriland’s biggest
gold-producer, the Waihi, presented in Lon-
don _ in May, shows that during 1926
211,530 short tons yielded gold and silver
worth £356,798; sundry receipts raised this
to £383,890, as against £398,694 for 1925.
Local and London expenditure took £312,279,
taxation (British and Dominion) £18,973
and depreciation of plant and machinery
£9257, leaving a net £43,381, plus £22,724
brought forward. Two divs. of Is. each
(November and May) absorbed £24,795, and
£16,514 is carried forward.
Development fell short of depletion, re-
serves being 558,000 tons, a decrease of
53,000. The mine’s lowest level (No. 15, 1880
feet) having proved a disappointment thus
far, the board’s policy, in place of deeper
shaft-sinking, is diamond drilling. Results
are yet inconclusive. The most encouraging-
discovery on this level to date is in the east
drive on the Martha lode north, where
values for 10ft. average 835., the ore being
3ft. wide, and' for 25ft. 945. 6d. in ore
wider than the drive. Later advice is that
the next 50ft. assays 31s. 9d. The labor
situation is peaceful; at any rate, the local
miners’ union has agreed to the battery run-
ning an extra shift weekly, enabling an addi-
tional 1000 tons a month to be crushed.
The co. is working under agreement with
its neighbor, the Grand Junction, which has
fallen on evil days; Waihi has a free hand
to deal underground with the Junction’s
property, sharing any profit on a fifty-fifty
basis. A few spots in the Junction are
regarded as worth testing, and some of its
ore is more accessible from the Waihi.
Waihi’s original half-million shares have
been reduced to ss. each by the return of
15s. capital. On this account £3382 remains
unclaimed by shareholders, some of it since
1921. The financial position is strong:
Investments total £341,462, a miscellaneous
lot, including Commonwealth loans, Aus-
tralian State and M.L. Government stocks,
and other gilt-edged securities in Britain
and abroad. Hora Hora hydro-electric works
appear in the sheet at cost, £159,535; for
these, in 1931, the M.L. Government has
agreed to pay £212,500. In addition, £64,000
is invested as an “exploration account,” to
be used for new enterprises, and the co.
values its interest in sundry mining ventures
at £5985. London holds a larger slice of
the scrip than M.L. and Australia, yet a
big gain would result from a transfer of
headquarters to M.L. Since its modest be-
ginning in 1893, Waihi has paid £5,470,353
in dividends and also £812,620 in income
and profits taxes. The co.’s palmy days were
1900 to 1911, when from 10s. to 18s. a
year was distributed. That prosperity never
will be repeated, but the mine has by no
means reached the end of its career, apart
from what the co. has in the savings stock-
ing. Latest quotation, about 18s.

Tongkah Harbor, in Western Siam, is the
daddy of Australian tin dredging proposi-
tions in Malaya, having been founded in
1906 by Captain Teddy Miles and the late
Henry Jones and his partners in the I.X.L.
jam co. (The original syndicate was called
the 1.X.L.) Since the first dredge started
in 1907 to the end of the financial year,
September 30 last. 17,295 tons of tin oxide
has been won, valued at £2,084,551, and divs.
totalling £640,000 or 85s. per £1 share have
been paid. Directors have now decided on
a reconstruction owing to the abandonment
of Bang Tao, the purchase of land at
Bidor and Chelong Bay, and the equip-
ping of these latter areas with modern
plant at a total cost of £210,000. The two
dredges from Bang Tao have been cutting
out for removal to Tongkah Harbor, and
the No. 2 dredge at Bidor will not be work-
ing till early in July, making three dredges
non-productive since last September. Earn-
ings have been reduced and the big expen-
diture had to be faced to reinstate full earn-
ing capacity. The co.’s original issued capi-
tal was £150,000. This was increased in
October, 1925, by the issue of 50,000 shares
at 255., a premium of 55., and in September,
1926, by the issue of 25,000 shares at a
premium of 20s. This left 25,000 shares,
which the directors have decided to issue
at a premium of 55., one for nine held, thus
completing the total capital provided for.
Apart from Tongkah Harbor itself and the
now abandoned Bang Tao area the co. will
have two dredges in operation shortly on
the Bidor property and two on Chelong Bay.
From the latter ground up to Sept. 30 last
277| tons of tin oxide had been recovered
from 784,300 cubic yards, averaging 0.791 b.
per c.y. The return was 13.786 d. per yard
and working costs 5.512 d. per yard. With
the new plants in order and fairly running
the directors anticipate handling a much
larger quantity of material than at any time
in the co.’s history.

Pungah Tin, Austral Malay’s pup, has
been heard from again. There was some
trouble over the leases for the area of 993
acres in Siam, but these having been over-
come the co. was duly floated a couple of
months ago in Malaya. Capital is £500,000
in £1 shares. Of these the parent co. took
100,000 f.-p.’s, 330.000 were offered for sub-
scription and 70,000 reserved. The staff of
Austral Malay was offered 80,000 shares, at
par, of the 330,000 above-mentioned, and the
balance of 250,000 shares were to be avail-
able to Austral Malay shareholders, five for
two. It is now announced that the latter
lot may be applied for at par on July 11.
The offer expires on July 30. Prospectuses,
application forms, etc., will be available with
the arrival of the Dutch mail from about the
middle of July. Three modern dredges were
to have been put on the property under the
original scheme. The 993 acres have an
average depth of 33 feet, containing
53.240.000 cubic yards, and the average
value is estimated at .831 b. tin oxide worth
72 p.c. metallic tin.

“A Large Shareholder” writes: —
I am trying to find out if the Marshall-Longton
and Lucknow North Extd. groups at Lucknow
(N.S.W.) produce periodical reports of operations or
balance sheets. I took 200 shares in May, 1924, and
subsequently a further 2000. There have been inci-
dental reports of a rich find in Marshall-Longton
and Lucknow North Extd. In fact, I received two
telegrams. One said: “Struck immensely rich gold
to-day, details later,” signed “Pritchard.” This
was on May 20, 1925. The other came on Sept.
12 from the Marshall-Longton: “Pinhead specks in
reef.” On another occasion “Pritchard” reported that
one of the directors was very excited: he had a
specimen that would go up to 12oz. to the ton of
reef, and 2s. shares had sold in Melbourne at
SS. Another report was that the whole of the
Lucknow Amalgamated Mines were being taken over
by an English co., giving us 2s. a share cash, and
the same number of 2s. shares f.-p. as we now hold.
This was on Jan. 15, 1926 —18 months past. Also
bonus shares were offered as inducement to take up
further shares in the Condobolin Mine. I have written
for information re the sale to the English co., but
can get no information. I was told 18 months or
two years ago to expect early dividends, but there
has been nothing but calls so far. Shares were
going to be listed on the Stock Exchange. Apparently
nothing has been done yet in that line. A Sydney
weekly said Lucknow North Extd. was showing. 80oz.
gold to the ton. A boom was anticipated. It is
slow in arriving. The directors have a battery, but
I have not seen any results of crushings. If we
can’t get anything else, surely we are entitled to a
full statement of the position.

A View from Elanora Lookout—the site of the proposed Country Club
It lies just to the north of Lake Narrabeen, and a few minutes’ detour from either the Lane Cove or Manly-Palm Beach roads
will bring the motorist to the spot.
Place together panoramas 1 and 2, and get an idea of what it looks like. Imagine a glittering blue sea in front, and sunlight
over a sweep of some of the most beautiful coastal country in N.S.W. from Bondi on one side to Pittwater on the other.
Here on Elanora Heights, from which the photograph was taken, is the ideal situation for a country club such as is so imperatively
needed to place Sydney on an equality with other cities of her size in social and recreational facilities,
LAND, PROPERTIES AND INVESTMENTS LTD.
Have acquired the Property of 518 Acres on which the Elanora Lookout stands
It is the first move in a series of operations which are calculated to yield to shareholders handsome returns. On the basis of
property experts’ valuations, it is estimated that this property alone will earn for shareholders an amount in excess of that covered by the
issue of 100,000 £1 shares now announced—an exceptional return from an investment protected all the time by solid land value.
Elanora land will be offered later by the foot, but in the meantime the opportunity is offered the public of participating in the
profits of buying by the acre. . ,
Included in the estate is an area of 200 acres which Mr. D. G. Soutar, the well-known golf architect, says is ideal for golf and the
other purposes of a country club.
“IT WAS A REVELATION TO ME,” reported Mr. Soutar, “to find a site of this description commanding the views and having
the soil of the Elanora estate.”

Land, Properties and Investments, Ltd., has been formed for the purpose of carrying on the business of buyers and sellers of land and
property and as an investment, trust and finance company. The company is in a position to secure remunerative business, and the present time is
considered favorable for the commencement of operations. A substantial revenue is anticipated from the business immediately to hand.
The shares offered in this company provide a medium through which the individual investor may secure a wide distribution and
a high return on his capital. The company will be in a position to secure business which is not open to the private investor and will
often be able to acquire investments on underwriting terms. The Elanora estate, which cost £70,000 and an option to subscribe for 30,000
shares at par, is valued for subdivision purposes to yield £300,000 gross, or £130,000 net. The return should be at least equal if part of
the property is utilised for a country club.
The Directors are very conscious of the important part a country club would play in furthering the interests of Sydney. Indica-
tions are in evidence of the great interest of golfers and their friends in Elanora, and its possibility of providing a long-felt want of a country
club. Naturally, if such a club as is projected is established, first regard must be given m its formation to golfing shareholders in Land,
Properties and Investments, Ltd.
The company does NOT intend to create a selling organisation for its disposal in subdivision, and thus enter into competition with
firms specialising in land sales, but prefers to hand it over to one of them for disposal, and in the above estimated returns the necessary
provision has been made.

James McGuire, one of S. Aus.’s Railway
Commissioners —W. A. Webb is Chief—has
gone where trains won’t worry him. He
was in his 71st year. At 20 McGuire was
stationmaster at Port Pirie, then a very
small station. It was his good w r ork in
handling a rapidly increasing business which
hoisted him 12 years later into the job of
traffic and locomotive superintendent in the
south division. After that his rise was
steady, and he became Commissioner on July
1, 1917. Four of his eight sons fought in
the war, and only one, who saw it right
through, came back.
Aldermanic confr&res will carry the
Nationalist banner in what used to be the
old Randwick electorate; H. Goldstein, who
was M.L.A. for Eastern Suburbs, has the
Coogee end and looks like a winner; E. P.
Tressider takes Randwick, where he may
have to fight hard, especially if the Govern-
ment rushes several hundred devotees of
Douglas into the district “to fix up the rifle-
range for home-building sites,” as it is
called. Both men are aldermen of Rand-
wick, and have taken turns at chain-wearing
for a dozen years.
Denis Morley Rooke, who was reported to
have abandoned his solo flight to Australia
after an unfortunate landing in the dark at
Karachi, but says he will carry on, has been
in most of the States, particularly Westralia
and Vic. For a couple of months he was in
charge of tractors and soil-stirring plant for
the Vic. Closer Settlement Board on soldier-
settlement allotments in the Tresco district.
Adventure is a passion with Rooke, and the
Karachi misadventure won’t discourage him.
He was, of course, in the Big Scrap, and
held a captaincy.
Vincent P. Taylor, who left Australia as
a youth and developed a flair for balloon-
ing, was back here when the war broke out.
He enlisted in the A.I.F. and The Bulletin
suggested that he ought to be useful in air
work; but Red Tape decided that, being
over 30, he was ineligible for service in the
heavens. So the artillery got him. Since
the war Taylor has been at his old game
in various parts of the world making a
living out of balloon flights with parachute
descents. At present in ’Frisco, he dreams
of an international balloon race in Sydney.
T. E. Wyatt, of Vic. Lands Department,
who went to London nearly four years ago
to become immigration officer, has been re-
called because the lull in bringing out
settlers left him little to do. The British
Government wants conditions for migrants
which the Closer Settlement Board cannot
supply. Wyatt, who is 61, draws £715 a
year as well as exes, at the late of 255.
a day or thereabouts. If he doesn’t care
to come back to office work in Melbourne
he can retire on his pension of £475 a year.
Nearly half a century ago Cardinal Moran
invited Mother Mary Clare Dunphy, of the
Callan Missionary College, Ireland, to come
to Australia and found a branch of the
Convent of Mercy. She selected Parramatta
as a base for headquarters, and from
thei’e she established branch orders through-
out the Commonwealth. She died at 78 the
other day, and her requiem music was played
by the orchestra which she helped to found
and which is composed of pupils and ex-
pupils of the parent convent.
Bank-manager Lipscomb, of the Union,
who died lately, used to tell a yarn about
a predecessor of his at Rochester (Vic.).
The managers of the township’s banks
were enjoying a game of 100 at the only
pub late one Saturday night when an inspec-
tor turned up. He put his head in the bar
parlor and said to one of the players: “I’ve
come up to count your cash—let’s go over
to the bank.” “No need to do that, sir,”
said the manager, “here it is, and the treas-
ury cash as well, in this little black bag.”
And so it was, except what was being used
to finance the players, one of whom was the
late J. Tilley Brown, afterwards a Vic.
M.H.R. That manager resigned on Monday.
Premier Lyons’s dash across the Straits
from the finance conference in Melbourne
to see his newly-arrived son in Hobart re-
calls how another politician, the late Wil-
liam Knox, let a fortune go so that he might
continue his voyage to Melbourne from
Albany to hold his first daughter in his
arms. Knox, who owed his wealth to luck
in mining, was met at Albany by friends who
urged him to come along up to Hannan’s
Find and take a hand in the best game going.
As he was on the point of yielding, a tele-
gram was handed to him. It announced
the birth of a daughter (the other kiddies
had been boys), and he decided that Han-
nan’s (Kalgoorlie it was soon to be known)
should do without him. Bill told an audience
at Hawthorn (Vic.) one night that he pro-
bably cast aside anything up to £150,000
by that decision, but hadn’t repented.
BARONET GEORGE CLIFFORD, of
Christchurch ( M.L. ), lawyer by train-
ing, financier by occupation, and sports-
man by choice.
It is reported from London that Allen
Stoneham, who “claimed to have been re-
sponsible for the introduction of electric
trams into Westralia,” left estate valued at
£70,000. The claim was never disputed in
Stoneham’s lifetime ; he not only introduced
the trams into Perth but sold them to the
Scaddan Labor Government. Being some-
thing of a humorist as well as a financier,
after securing a price which was at least 50
p.c. more than the enterprise was worth, he
wrote to Premier Jack Scaddan congratu-
lating that worthy on having got a bargain.
Jack triumphantly produced the missive in
Parliament by way of crushing a critic.
Tully, who represents Goulburn in the
N.S.W. talk factory, is likely to be opposed
at next election by Jack Garry, a Digger,
owner of Garryowen station near Yass, and
a Bachelor of Engineering. Garry ought to
be acceptable both to the Nats, and the
C.P. Tully has looked after the roads and
bridges side of his job, but he’s too far out
of Sydney not to suffer as a follower of
Dictator Lang.
W. E. (“Billy”) Finucane, dead in Bris-
bane at 83, was a man of the most varied
interests and activities in his long acquain-
tance with Queensland, which began in 1865.
Born into the army in the then British
island of Corfu, he was an accomplished
linguist, speaking half a dozen European
languages. Queensland will best remember
him as chief clerk of the Police Department,
but his knowledge of Levantine tongues
later caused Hugh Nelson to appoint him a
touring commercial agent in southern
Europe, a job he filled with conspicuous
success. Earlier Government service in
North Queensland gave him opportunities
for making a unique collection of aboriginal
weapons, etc. Italy, for whose subjects
he did much good service in the early days,
long ago decorated him with the order of St.
Maurice and St. Lazarus. In odd moments
Finucane devoted himself to painting, music,
sculpture and writing—he helped to found
Queensland Punch at Ipswich. Not a
moment of the busy old Irishman’s long life
was wasted.
Edmund Drake-Brockman, the fourth judge
of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, was
given a tough contract on his first appearance
in Sydney—an application for a new award
in the clothing trades. Some of the industries
involved are tailoring, dressmaking, straw
hats, sewn hats and caps, cleaning and dyeing,
furs and umbrellas; and the union has named
6000 employers as respondents. A feature of
the ease is the appearance of two ex-union
officials on the other side. B. A. A. Fullar-
ton, formerly of the Clothing Trades Union,
speaks for the Queensland Chamber of Manu-
factures, and George Lewis, who has lived in
nearly every union office in Goulburn-street,
Sydney, is mouthpiece for the Ma State’s
Chamber of Manufactures. Lewis was showm
the door in 1916 for being a conscriptionist.
Ned Hogan, Victoria’s new Premier, is
showing tremendous energy. With the fond
ambition of exhibiting himself to the largest
part of the State in the smallest possible
time, he is tearing over the scenery deliver-
ing amiable orations, patting babies’ and lis-
tening to innumerable deputations. Already
it is said that Hogan i s over-exercising hini-
sett, and a proposal has been made that he
should pass one of his portfolios to a
colJ.6cigu6. CL his, however, he will pro-
bably not do. You can’t suggest overwork
to a man who spent Ileaven-knows-how-manv
hours a day digging spuds in his youth.
Sam Page has reported to Peter at the
age of 90. His grandpa settled at Jericho
(Tas.) in 1819, aiid the descendants
amassed the biggest block and the biggest
flock the Speck can boast. Sam inherited
Pages coaches, which ran between Hobart
and Launceston till the railway came. The
121 miles were covered in 14* hours, with
an express service of 10 hours, and the
train hasn’t made much difference. Horses,
of which 300 were kept in work, were
changed every 10 or 12 miles, and three
trips were made daily each way. Sam's
father was one of the founders of the Tas.
Racing Club and Sam himself bred and
raced many horses. In his last years he
wrote a good deal about the early days.
Drakeford and McKenzie, two of Labor’s
latest Parliamentary recruits, are to move
and second the address-in-reply in Vic.
Assembly at the opening of the session.
McNamara, an ex-Minister, and ICiernan, a
candidate for the Agency-General, are to
submit a similar motion in the Uppah
Chambah. _ They are the only two Laborites
available in the Legislative Council; the
other four are Ministers.
David McNair Dingwall, who recently
died at Auckland (M.L.), left almost the
whole of his estate for the founding of an
orphanage for children of any race or creed
who might be left destitute in Maoriland.
The amount was reckoned in the first place
at a bit over £lOO,OOO, and the trustees have
been told there is another quarter of a
million coming to them. Dingwall was an
accountant, but a builder-father laid the
foundation of the big fortune the son, a
bachelor, handed over at 82.
The oldest native-born R.C. priest is
Father Tom Ivelsh, who had a diamond jubi-
lee the other day at Westbury (Tas.). Ho
was born at Hobart in 1843, was baptised
by Father Thierry, and was ordained in
Rome 60 years ago. He has served under
every R.C. crozier that has ruled the see of
Hobart.
Rabbi Brodie, of Melbourne, is going back
to England to take a tutorial position at
Jews’ College. The young man, who waited
in England to get his rabbinical diploma
after signing on for Melbourne, has been
four years in Australia, and his going is
a shock to the Melbourne Chosen, who reckon
it gets harder every year to find a qualified
rabbi.
Maxwell Gumbleton has been succeeded as
Anglican Bishop of Ballarat by Phillip
Charles Thurlow
Crick. The new
Bishop, a Cam-
bridge man, previ-
ously wore the mitre
a t Rockhampton :
before that he was
a Bush Brother in
N.Q. This is the
second transference
of a prelate from
Rockie” to Balla-
rat in recent years.
Bishop Higgins,
one-time coadjutor
to Cardinal Moran,
went from there to
succeed the mitred
Moore.

David Davies, one of the Papuan pioneers,
is dead, at 73. He battled up to Bulolo.
and was working a claim on Merri Creek
when he fell ill. He was carried down to
Wau Creek on a stretcher, taken to the
coast by aeroplane and borne to Salamoa by
launch; but no nursing could save him.
In the early days of mining on the main-
land Davies, a white companion and several
natives were carried out to sea on a raft.
The natives swam ashore; the whites drifted
nearly a hundred miles before they were
picked up by a German ship off Finchaven.
The honest fellow’s dream was to get at a
patch of osmiridium of which he knew in
the bed of the Aikora, but the floods beac
him every time.
ON THE BALMAIN FERRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yo-lio, you poor suburbanite
Of Mosman and Cremorne!
Slink back and forth by day or night
To end as you were born!
But I roam round the endless sea,
And round and round again;
For I’m the wanderer bold and free
Who ferries to Balmain.
Black ants who make your silly run
From south to northern shore,
Know you how Sydney’s work is done
Outside the office door?
Where Darling Harbor’s derricks creak,
And crates swing up and down,
There only should a wise man seek
Who looks for Sydney town.
My girl she lived on Mosman Heights,
And I in Darling-street;
So we had different appetites,
And tastes that could not meet.
I left her to her flannelled sports,
Her chevaliers of tea,
Who lived upon their tennis-courts
And never sailed the sea.
They never saw the South Sea tramps
Bring phosphate from Nauru,
Nor smelt the smell of mountain camps
On some Norwegian crew;
They met not every little while,
As I meet every day.
The logs that rode twelve thousand miles
To swim in Johnstone’s Bay.
They hailed a braggart battleship
That bore a prince along;
But I know every hooker’s trip
To Tathra or Wyong;
And I can feel in bone and joint
And sniff with nostrils wide
The oil that drifts by Ballast Point
With every rising tide.
CANON CHARLTON, of Sydney.
Put the nor’-easter in my teeth
To row from shore to shore
With thirty fathoms underneath
The splashing of the oar;
The petrol rafts are ’thwart my course,
I see the tanks as well —•
My Pyramids, whose pent-up force
Would blow the town to Hell.
At Milson’s Point a train I found,
And God knows where I went:
I think I played a nine-hole round
With some Killara gent.
And oh! I found it passing hard,
Till out I steamed again,
Re-greeting, in the chandler’s yard,
The world that is Balmaiu.

“Jimmy Possum” : I have never seen myrtle
used for tool hafts; but a youngster of about
an inch and a half at the base is much fav-
ored by Bananaland bullockies for whip
handles. Apart from springiness and tough-
ness, and having just the right weight, a
myrtle whip-handle tapers in a way which
gives the rod a good balance, and the notches
left at evenly-graduated lengths on both sides
where the branches have been cut away
closely give the whip-purchases an ornamen-
tal appearance. I have known professional
(loggers go miles to secure a good myrtle
handle.

“J. McG.”: Coming down from the back
of Bourke to the railhead with 500 fat
lambs I noticed that one little fellow always
walked near my dog.
I was amazed when
putting the lambs in
camp to see him come
out from the flock and
lie beside the dog.
That animal got up
and settled somewhere
else, to be immediately
followed by the lamb.
At length the dog and
lamb rested close to-
gether, and that con-
tinued for the whole
journey. In fact, on
longer acquaintance
the dog so approved of
the arrangement that,
after finishing his sup-
per. lie was wont to
throw himself down between the lamb's legs
and snuggle up to it for warmth.

“Fisherman”: Although there are myriads
of eels in the eastern rivers of Australia (I
never heard of them on the other side of the
continent), after the spawning season little
account is taken of them. At periods when
Prospect Dam (N.S.W.) overflows thousands
of eels from 210. to 151 b. are released into
George’s River and elsewhere; but they
don’t seem to do the damage here that their
cousins are responsible for in Maoriland. A
reason is that we haven’t so many trout
streams. In one district in the North Island
the local Acclimatisation Society started out
to clear the rivers of eels, and in a seven
months’ campaign one man alone tallied 1002
heads. The heaviest catch weighed 111 b.

“Tamornie” : I can’t say whether animals

Guinea there is a species of butterfly that
does. The tiny aviators appear shortly before
the north-west monsoon and may be seen
on the beaches alighting on sand that has
been recently wetted by spray. Close obser-
vation shows that in every case the extended
proboscis is thrust into the wet sand.
Bad Australian”: “Gregor” (B. 9/6/’27)
may be correct in his suggestion that the
eucalypt is not strictly indigenous to Aus-
i T it his generalisations on the pro-
bability of its natural occurrence from Cali-
fornia to Chile are unconvincing. Had the
tree originated in either North or South
America, the desert of Atacama and the
great sterile tableland of Bolivia would have
presented an impassable barrier to its fur-
ther progress. Of course, it might have
spread in either direction on the eastern side
via the Gran Chaco and the immense “sel-
vas” of the Amazon Valley, but it has never
been found in either of those forests.
A SLIGHT ERROR OF JUDGMENT.
LARRY: “They tell me Pat got smashed up like that at Jim Fegan’s juneral. What
happened to him?”
MICK: “He told the widdy that Jim had gone to a happier home.”
Gregor's Giant might have been introduced
by one of the “forty-niners" who rushed this
country when gold was discovered. The
seed of the first eucalypt grown in N.
America was in all probability taken home
by some of the whalers who frequented our
coasts in the very early days. As for those
in S. America, any enlightened Chilean will
tell you that they came over in ships which
carried grain from Chile to Australia almost
from the beginning of Australian settlement.
During 14 or 15 years’ wandering in S.
America I saw thousands of eucalypts, but
not one ot them was growing in the primeval
forest. The only similarity to Australian
flora I noted was in the case of the ferns,
mimosas and palms.

“Hori”: Here’s a recipe for freeing dogs
from ticks (B. 10/0/’27). Break up quarter
of a bar of Kiltie soap and boil it in a
kerosene-tin of water until the stuff dissolves.
Place the dog in a tub and bathe with por-
tion of this emulsion diluted in half water,
taking care that it reaches the skin and does
not merely run off the hair. Work quickly,
so that the dog may have a thorough soak-
ing, but do not leave him in the mixture
more than two or three minutes. Repeat
every 7to 10 days. When clusters of ticks,
form in the ears, plaster them liberally with
axle-grease. Kerosene is sudden death to
ticks, but it scalds the skin, causing the hair
to fall out and sores to form where the
dog scratches the tender parts.

“Simon”: I nominate bunny as the best
all-round dish and the hardest to classify.
My wife has several times rung him in on
us as fowl. Once at a tony hotel an
eloquent M.P., with whom I was travelling,
selected from the menu - “Braized duck and
oyster sauce.” He was doing the dish jus-
tice when suddenly he made a discovery.
Calling a waitress, he said : “Since when has
a duck had a hind leg like that?” I’ve
learnt since that braized duck is a common
disguise for bunny in the trade, but is gen-
erally limited to the rib portion.
$ $ . $ He
“Sea' Nomad”: Ships invariably carry
stowaways. Snakes, lizards, mice, rats, cen-
tipedes, beetles and humans are the main
varieties. The life found down the dark
hold of a big ship is surprising. Boats seek-
ing the treasures of the Indies, the Straits,
Java and the tropic isles are favored havens
of these voyagers. They come aboard mostly
in crate and bale cargoes, many of- them
having already travelled over mountain,
jungle, and swamp. I remember the conster-
nation caused down the hold of a South
American tramp when a monkey leapt from
the darkness and clung round the neck of
the bos’n. The man screamed like a maniac
and only the mate’s tripping foot prevented
him from leaping overboard. But it is gen-
erally smaller fry that are thus shanghaied.
Aboard one of the big oil-tankers a lizard
recently selected his quarters in the chart-
room. He ventures into the light only occa-
sionally, but is heard every night chasing
cockroaches. The stowaways quickly make
themselves at home in their new environment,
where they live under ideal conditions of
darkness and warmth and fascinating smells.
For tucker they have the cargo and them-
selves.
* * * *
“Te Ilipi”: I have known of several cases
of albinism amongst birds (B. 20/5/’27). 1
have seen a white blackbird and, what must
be extremely rare, a white cuckoo. White
starlings are less uncommon. My experience,
unlike that of “Momokeni,” is that starlings
take no particular notice of the exceptional
color of a cobber.
“Outback”: Albino specimens of almost
every kind of bird have been recorded in N.S.W.
On the other hand nature sometimes sup-
plies an excess of certain pigment with sur-
prising results. Thus a surplus of yellow
pigment gives the xanthic variety, and when
black pigments predominate the melanic
variety is the result. These variations are
especially noticeable among rabbits, gener-
ally when the pests reach the peak in
phenomenal seasons.
“Sucre”: On the Atherton tableland
(N.Q.) is a species of acacia-tree that is
one of the wonders of plant life. Nobody in
the district knows its correct name. It grows
to a height of about 7ft. and coils up its
leaves at sunset. If touched after the sun
has gone down the tree shakes itself violently.
An odor is thrown off by it sufficiently
strong to give an over-proof headache. What
is its name?
* * * #
“Mulgo” : The spring-mattress idea seems
to have originated among the farming folk.
I knew many farmers on the Richmond and
Clarence rivers who made their own bed-
steads, the frames of which were strongly
constructed of split timber, trimmed with axe
and adze, or with just round timber cut in
the scrub. Small holes were bored all round
and fencing-wire run through them, length-
ways and crossways. When strained tightly
they made a better bed than the present-day
spring-mattress, which is always slackening
and sagging. The bedtick was filled with
corn husks, shredded with a table fork. Such
beds were soft and comfortable to lie on, but
made the devil of a noise every time you
turned over. An old selector, after visiting
a farmer friend, complained that he threw
the rustling thing on the floor, and then
found that he had been given a panel of a
wire fence, laid sideways, to sleep on.

THE FLIGHT OF THE LOST SOULS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ere nightfall comes, a sunless west
Is splashed with sullen red ;
The gathering shades bring murmurs weird
And rustlings overhead.
Forth from some unknown bourne they come.
As dull, grey day retires,
The restless souls, the vagrant souls,
To drone upon the wires.
The sky is flecked with flying clouds
Like Argos scudding forth ;
A wind that cuts you like a knife
Comes howling from the north.
The women draw the window-blinds
And stir their kitchen fires,
While down the chimney comes the dirge
That’s moaned upon the wires.
A mongrel dog is cold to-night
And whining on his chain ;
A restless ewe that’s lost her lamb
Is bleating on the plain.
And by the road where poplars grow
In graceful-tapered spires
The lost souls moan amongst the leaves
And sigh along the wires.
The township lights seem farther off,
The road wind-swept and white;
The drooping lines on either side
Sway to and fro to-night
From pole to pole, from arm to arm,
Bike strings of ancient lyres,
Where lost souls seeking peace and rest
Are crooning on the wires.
The stars are pale and far between,
The Cross is hanging low—-
A beacon pointing out a way
Where weary souls may go.
And with the restless, racing wind
That wavers not nor tires,
The vagrant souls, the tortured souls.
Are pleading on the wires.

Why every motorist
should know the meaning of the word
ALEMITE
ħ
Alemite-Zerk Ford Set
Ford owners should equip their cars with
the Alemite-Zerk Lubrication System. A
complete set of fittings and compressor
gun costs only a small amount of money
and saves costly bearings. You can easily
install the fittings yourself in place of the
grease cups. Makes Ford lubrication
easy and positive.
h
Alemite Transmission
Lubricant
An entirely new type of lubricant for
gears and transmission. Reduces friction
to a minimum. Means from 1 to 1%
more miles per gallon of petrol by actual
test. More pep and power, longer life for
gears. Two-finger gear shifting in cold
weather because it does not harden or
“channel.” Made without fillers. Have
it put into your transmission gear boxes
every 2500 miles and say good-bye to
rear-end troubles.
ALEHSTC
fabriainr ;
Alemite Chassis Lubricant
Made especially for use with the Alemite
System. Will stand up under 3000 pounds
pressure. Ordinary greases break down
at 200 pounds. Resists heat up to 400
degrees Fahrenheit. Will lubricate prop-
erly at 30 degrees below zero. Equally
valuable for farm implements, motor-
boats, etc. In convenient 5-pound tins.
ĥ
Alemite Gas-co-lator
A device for filtering the petrol as you
drive. Takes out all the water and dirt
particles that clog the carburetor. Re-
moves the cause of practically all trouble
from excessive carbon, oil dilution, pitted
valves, hard starting, stalling. Sold on a
30-days trial. Satisfaction or money
cheerfully refunded.
ħ
Alemite Spring Protectors
For good looks and easy riding. Made to
fit every model and size of motor car
springs. Snug fitting, nickel trimmed.
They keep out mud and grit, stop
squeaks and give added tyre mileage.
Last for years. The surest preventive
against broken springs.
h
Alemite Penetrating Oil
A graphite lubricant designed especially
for use where extreme penetrating quali-
ties are essential. Unexcelled for lubri-
cating motor car springs. Works in
between the spring leaves without jack-
ing up the car. A perfect lubricant
wherever a light oil is needed. Dissolves
rust, prevents corrosion. Speeds up dis-
mantling work by loosening tight bolts
and nuts. Sold in pint and gallon tins,
and large drums. Can be sprayed OO
with a special sprayer equipment.
“Alemite” is the name of a simple, easy posi-
tive system for the lubrication of the 20 to
60 hard-working, dust-exposed chassis bear-
ings of a motor car. Its full name is the “Ale-
mite High Pressure Lubrication System.”
It was designed to make the lubrication of
these chassis bearings so easy that there
would no longer be any excuse for neglect-
ing lubrication, and so positive that the
lubrication would always be effective in pre-
venting friction and wear.
That there was and is an urgent need for it,
is shown by the fact that 80% of the repairs
on the moving parts of motor cars are due to
faulty or neglected lubrication.
That Alemite meets this need is proved by
the fact that the System is in use today on
more than 10,000,000 motor cars —by the
fact that 93 out of every 100 American-made
cars are equipped with the Alemite System
before they leave the factories.
The Alemite System is
extremely simple
It consists in placing a small, dust-proof
Alemite fitting on each chassis bearing in
place of the old-fashioned grease or oil cup.
The lubricant is forced under high pressure
through these fittings entirely through the
bearing, all the old, worn-out gritty grease
being forced out at the same time. The
lubricant gets to the bearing and stays there,
protecting the bearing perfectly against wear.
The work is done by merely twisting the
handle of the Alemite compressor gun which
holds the lubricant, the gun being placed
over each fitting in turn.
Your car can be Alemite-equipped
at small cost
If your car is already equipped with this
money-saving system, use it every 500 miles
and you’ll cut the cost of operating your car
anywhere from a half-penny to a penny
half-penny per mile.
If your car is not so equipped, the instal-
lation of Alemite fittings can be made quickly
and at a surprisingly low cost. A fitting
costing only a few pennies will save a bear-
ing worth many pounds.
In case your regular service man cannot
supply you with these fittings or any of the
Alemite products shown at the left, write to
any of the distributors listed below and your
needs will be taken care of promptly.

When Jazz first burst on an astonished world it was crude, rough,
disordered. Its producers did not understand it ; nor did the
players, nor did the public.
But a decade of development has made Jazz "something else again.” It fills its own
appointed place in the musical scheme of things. Now, there are many fine exponents
of Jazz, on the piano. And the greatest of them all is Lopez.
When this harlequin of the keyboard plays for the Ampico, his performance is caught
exactly, unerringly The re-enactment through Beale-Ampico is the real Lopez. Ask
him for an,encore, when you will. He’ll give it again and again. Not a bar, not a
note, not a shading ever different from the original.
Great to listen to, greater still to dance to—jazz is a tonic and an exhilaration. Not till
you hear Lopez do you know it at its best. And he plays it only for the Ampico.
As fine a master in his own sphere as the leading exponents of the orthodox, Lopez is a
possession always within your reach. Use him, when and how you will. He’ll beat a
rhythm into your blood that will set your feet a-cruise on a blue sea of delight. He’ll
make you tingle with the joy of living.
BF.ALE-AMPICO
brings this priceless service to devotees of the dance, home-makers and others. It offers
all the latest dance music played by the ablest exponents of rhythm, including (in ad-
dition to Lopez) Ferdie Grofe, Adam Carroll, J. Milton Delcamp, Ralph Reichenthal and
others who record their playing exclusively for the Ampico.
NOT ONLY DANCE MUSIC
Of course dance music is not the only thing that
the Beale-Ampico provides it brings also the
playing of the greatest pianists in the world,
Godowsky, Rachmaninoff, Levitzki, Ornstein,
Schnitzer and hosts of others.
INVITATION TO HEAR IT
It is impossible to describe the Beale-Amptco—*
you must hear it to appreciate how marvellous it is
—come at your convenience and spend a pleasant
half hour listening to a programme of your own
choosing, in the Beale Salon or at any of our
Branch Addresses.
Exchange your piano for a Beale-Ampico
The Beale-Ampico may be yours to-day. A moderate initial payment, and the
value of your present instrument deducted from the price, and the balance
arranged on easy terms, makes possession of the Beale-Ampico possible for
almost anyone.

“Topee”: Mac was booked for a shearing-
pen, but arrived three weeks too early for
roll-call. The boss, however, found him a
temporary job looking after an out-back pad-
dock. Mac, who was a champion go-slower
when on wages, camped in the hut, ate, slept
and read a heap of old magazines lie found
there; put in the time quite enjoyably, in
fact, till one day the boss came out. “Sheep
all right?” he asked. “Doing fine,” was
Mac’s reply. “How’s the little tank at the
end of the paddock holding out?” Mac made
a blind stab at it. “Pretty low; I pulled
three woollies out only yesterday.” “Did
you,” the boss retorted. “Hut your traps in
the car. I won’t have a pen for you this
year.” “Why not?” asked the surprised
Mac. “The man who can pull three sheep
out of a hundred-gallon iron tank,” the boss
said, “is too damned clever for me. Hurry
up!”
NO TIME FOR HALF MEASURES.
SHIFT BOSS: “Mawther, get candle, quick — caan't ’all-'ear manager in dark.”
Jimmy Susu's tragedy, as told by “C.
Coral” : “My word, dose up my wife, Gada,
she finish die. Gada and that small girl they
go along bush for look some wangai [native
plum] ; me, I got work for clean garden. 1
stop little way more far. By-’n’-bye I hear
Gada holla, she sing out big one. I run
quick, I look ’long Gada. My word! One big
carpet-snake, fathom and half long, he bite
her ’long neck, and he trying for fix his tail
so lie can squeeze neck belong Gada all same
like he do for curlew or fowl. Me, I catch
hold that snake, haul him come. Blood!
My word! Blood lie come out from neck
all same like when you cut turtle. I take
piece stick open mouth belong that snake,
and put some dirt inside from my pipe—you
know, that dirt after you bin finish smoke
long time. Proper poison that one. That
snake he jump, then he go stiff, finish die.”
* * * *
“Mulgo”: It is generally thought that
Ballina, on the Richmond River (N.S.W.),
was named after a
place in Ireland, but
the site was known to
the abos. as “Boolli-
nah,” which means
“plenty of oysters.”
Great beds of old
shells may still be seen
there, where the clans
of the surrounding dis-
trict and from far in-
land foregathered and
feasted. The locality
is a good place for
oysters still, but in
those days the shellfish
were as large as
saucers, and tons could
be got with little
trouble. It was also
a good place to fish,
and swamps a little
way inland provided a
great variety of water-
fowl. So Boollinah for ages and ages was
a camp of feasts- and corroborecs.
* * * *
“Colub”: The sea-snake mentioned by
“Nakhoda” (B. 12/5/’27) as a visitor to the
Westralian bathing beaches is not the reptile
commonly known by that name in tropical
waters. The true sea-snake (Enhydrina val-
akdim) is, proportionately to its size, one
of the most venomous creatures in existence.
Its usual length is from two to three feet,
but occasionally a specimen grows to six or
seven feet. In nor’-east New Guinea waters
these snakes may be seen in hundreds during
the breeding season. They flock in colonies,
and frequently in a patch of calm water a
number of them knot themselves together
into a seemingly tangled mass and lie bask-
ing in the sunshine. As a rule they keep to
the sea, though now and again some wander
inland several miles.
“Momokeni”: The account by “Up Top”
(B. 26/5/’27) of cultivated trees and plants
running wild on deserted Bananaland gold-
fields does not square with my own experi-
ence. Roaming round the Louisiades I
never found a small island, other than native-
owned, where there was enough wild food
to nourish anything save a goat. Deserted
native gardens go back to bush in an in-
credibly short space of time, and taro, mani-
oca, sweet potatoes and even the white man’s
beans, when left untended, develop a poison
which has proved fatal to both human beings
and domestic animals. Merely picking the
fruit seems to have some influence on orchard
trees in retaining their characteristics under
cultivation. On Misima Island, where miners
planted oranges and lemons many years ago,
though the trees are entirely surrounded by
bush and not cultivated in any way, the
fruit is gathered by the natives and the trees
continue to yield eatable crops.
THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW.
COUNTRY J.P.: “Young feller, the Court doesn’t believe your excuses. It considers
that you made a bona-fide attempt to swindle the complaintiff.”
“Whynot”: I have had no experience in
electrocuting centipedes (B. 26/5/’27), but
can testify that a frill-lizard does not enjoy
the same immunity from the effects of the
electric current. Recently I connected 240
volts to a garden fork and touched the lizard
on the back of its head. It gave a convul-
sive leap and dropped dead. This, however,
was on damp ground, which provided an
effective earth. Seeing a dog standing on
concrete I stroked him on the back with one
of the prongs. The hair must have acted as
an efficient insulator, for he did not stir.
But when I touched the skin he jumped for-
ward and hit the wall in front of him with
a dull thud, and for days afterwards he
sneaked about with his tail between his legs,
whimpering softly from time to time. All I
have to do now is to produce the garden-
fork and he is soon a speck of dust in the
distance.
* * * *
“Biro”: I give the belt to spiders for
sagacity in the selection of home-sites, and
for building and repairing their homes when
made. In shale country it is common to
see the bits of shale or slate in a slanting
position, the line thus forming a natural
cave for spiders. Here the insects dig cir-
cular burrows, helping each other. Appa-
rently it must be the females only who work;
I have never known males and females to
work together. These spiders form forked
burrows that are always under shelter. No
lids are needed here, but in grassy land lids
are a feature of the burrows. They are very
thin hut tough, have no hinges, but lift up
and down like a piece of paper. But for
being left slightly ajar, they are indistin-
guishable from the ground. On a bare sur-
face the spider constructs a stout mud lid
for her dug-out, and close examination dis-
closes its silken hinges. It has bevelled
edges and a heavy rim is made on one side
so that it may close securely after its owner.
Spiders that live in webs go over their nets,
repairing them constantly and biting off
rough bits.

“Anthony Gloster” : There’s only one cer-
tain cure for girth gall in a horse. Treat
and ride him every day until he recovers.
Turn a horse out with a girth gall and get
him in again with a sound skin, and he will
only gall again immediately. When the
gali is noticed, bathe it in water as hot as
the horse will stand for five to ten minutes.
This will get the swelling down and clean
the raw surface: dry thoroughly and grease
the sore well before adjusting the girth,
which should itself be cleaned and also soft-
ened with oil or kitchen fat. A galled horse
ought never to be ridden fast. Ride slowly
and with as loose a girth as possible. And
when you bring the horse in, wash the sore
with hot water, wfipe it and smear with
kerosene and fat. A gall responds to this
treatment immediately, and will grow hair
within a fortnight.
“Topee”: Forty years ago most of the
“whalers” up and down the Darling used to
have slices of cork dangling on string from
their hat-rims for fly-protectors (B. l)/(>/’27).
These contraptions were known as “waga-
toos,” after the Queensland hospital for the
insane, for which institution their users were
popularly supposed to be qualifying. 1 recall
“Wheelbarrow Jimmy,” a little but wiry old
man who pushed a long, narrow wheeled box
from Wentworth to Bourlte and back again,
as regularly as the coach journeyed. The
barrow contained old iron and other rubbish
and also two kerosene-tins which, he said,
were useful for dry stages. The first time I
met him he was resting under a tree. After
securing some tobacco he yoked up, saying
that lie had 14 miles to do before reaching
his night’s camp. “But, thank Gord,” he
added, “I haven’t to carry my swag like some
poor coves!” One afternoon a station-hand
found him dead in his barrow. He was
buried in it.
“Sebrof”: Cork-liat millinery wasn’t a
myth when I was. a nipper living at Tar-
coola station, on the Darling. Old Taffy, who
drove a poison-cart, had a plentiful supply
of bottle-stoppers around his hat, and it was
the ambition of mv life at that time to have
a “lid” similarly decorated.
“Anthony Gloster”: “Prop’s” luck was out
when he was looking for a swaggie with
corks round his hat. I saw one'on the road
between Moree (N.S.W.) and Mungindi some
years ago in a particularly troublesome fly
season. And at the last Tenterfield show
there was a queer old greybeard with an
antique cabbage-tree hat from which dangled
17 corks on strings of varying lengths.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: a. peculiarity of the goanna
is that it runs up a tree on the side
opposite to the person watching it. In a
fair amount of travelling on bush tracks, I
don’t think I have seen more than a couple
of goannas that have not done this. Their
usual procedure when a car or other vehicle
approaches is to cross the road leisurely and
make for the nearest tree, streaking up it
like lightning. Curiously enough, although
one sees scores of goannas ascend a tree, one
rarely sees one descend. Probably the go.
makes sure before descending that his way
is clear.

“The Welkin”: Pelicans abound on the
Murray, where annually they devour great
quantities of fish, and despite efforts to destroy
them still exist in numbers. I have shot
many of them, and find the trouble of skin-
ning them well worth while, as the breast,
consisting of a closely knitted mass of snow-
white small feathers, is a thing of beauty.
On an average it measures a foot square.
In addition to the feather breast the bill-bag
could be commercialised, as it is similar in
quality to the best kid leather.
❖ Hi Hi Hi
“D.M.T.N.”: I kept an orb-spider under
observation. It was loaded on back and logs
with spiderlets, and I wanted to test the
statement that these dots later on become
aeronauts. One day, when they seemed fit
to emigrate, I opened a window that created
an outward draught. Soon the specks were
seen throwing out the finest of silken clews.
These almost imperceptible threads grew
longer and longer, and all of them extended
towards the window. At last they became
long enough, and away went one little spider
after another, each at the end of its thread.
THE LIKELY BIT OF COUNTRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though its boundaries are hazy, and they
never can agree
On the shortest way to reach it, or its true
locality,
All the tales of all the travellers can no
finer land disclose
Than the likely bir of country every old
prospector knows.
Though its worth no man has tasted, you
will never have a doubt,
Should you hear the old chaps talking, that
there’s plenty gold about,
For the surest indications are apparent to
the eye
In this likely bit of country that they always
mean to try.
Some were making for the island, and their
water-bags were low
When they passed their land o’ promise in
the very long ago ;
Some were heading for Wiluna, some were
on the Lawlers track,
But they one* and all intended to prospect
it coming back.
Still, how frequently it happens that the
thing which you intend
Shall be first upon the programme gets
deferred until the end.
Something’s always come to stop them, but
a gleam is in their eyes
As they gaze across the distance where the
likely country lies.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGR
SUMMER AND WINTER FALLOW.
“Glenfield”: Summer fallowing in the
Mallee (Vic.) has not shown any greatly-
increased wheat yield over early winter fal-
low so far on the official experimental plots;
but there is no doubt about its advantage
over winter fallow on the farm. Apart from
distributing the work of cultivation more
evenly throughout the year, the benefit of it
is particularly marked in this unusually dry
season in providing sheep feed. Although
less than two inches of rain has fallen during
the last six months, the free germination of
weeds on the summer fallow, and particularly
wild oats on the older country, is in strong
contrast to the stubble land alongside, which
is almost bare of greenness. Care should
lie taken not to summer fallow more land
than can be handled properly, otherwise in a
normal year the vigorous germination and
growth of rubbish may make a second plough-
ing necessary, and that seems to decrease the
quality of fallow.
FOOTROT.
“W.R.” (Maoriland) : One-third of our
run was heavy undulating clay and the other
part level peat swamp. Our sheep on the
clay were pestered with footrot, especially
after rains. When the “clay” sheep were
changed on to the peat the footroot disap-
peared without medication ; neither did the
peat sheep acquire it. This happening after
a change-over or two, I examined more
closely the feet of such of the “clay” sheep
as limped and found a pellet of dry clay
wedged between the hooves. On picking this
out we saw that it had blocked the small
teat-like vent present between all sheep’s
hooves. To test whether this blockage might
have caused the rot I fixed a moist pellet
by lashing the two halves in such a manner
that the pellet remained in place and awaited
events. In due course that previously sound
foot got the rot. Upon this we concluded
that the cause of footrot was the closure of
this vent pendicle. We therefore changed
the sheep from clay to peat frequently. This
ended our footrot.
Pigs also have these foot-vents. But theirs
are a row of about four or five holes on
the inner side of the lower part of the
front legs. My curiosity to note whether
their closure, by means of wrappings, would
cause hog-footrot was not so keen as to test
it.
PEANUTS.
“Penfield”: The Commonwealth Govern-
ment having prohibited the importation of
peanuts, plants or seeds, except by permis-
sion of the Minister for Health, there ought
to be something doing. Importers have been
warned to get Susy on encouraging the culti-
vation of the vegetable and advised that
permits to import will be given only in
exception al cases.
At present Australia’s requirements are
about 1500 tons a year; if we used as much
per head as the U.S.A. does we should re-
quire 25.000 tons. And quite as many nuts
as the U.S.A. markets are not marketed —
at least, not in nut form. These are crops
on to which hogs are turned to “root or
die.” A nut diet is not, however, a good
one for pork unless it is supplemented by
something harder. Then it is first-class.
Since it is practically impossible to get out
all the nuts, it is a good plan to turn pigs
into the nut paddock after the harvesting.
They will do the gleaning all right.
The N.S.W. Department of Agriculture
is keen on the subject and has published a
ninepenny pamphlet on the best methods
of cultivation, etc., and the best sorts to
grow. A Sydney firm offered for the 1926
crop of White Spanish nuts, grade 1 (not
less than 70 p.c. sound No. 1 kernels),
per lb.; grade 2 (65-70 p.c. No. l’s), 4d.;
grade 3 (60 p.c. No. l’s), 3fd.
A farmer who has a patch of ground that
will grow maize might do a lot worse than
experiment. Even if the crop is not an Al
success, he will have grown some good pig-
feed which the porkers will harvest for them-
selves.
HINTS FOR THE POULTRY YARD.
Dub or cut off the combs of all light-breed
breeding males of the single-combed varie-
ties. They do better for it.
Classify all your growing stock as they
develop, keeping the early layers apart from
the late layers. Be systematic.
Make size or weight of egg the principal
factor when selecting hens to be used in the
breeding-pens, thereby maintaining quality of
produce.
Most poultry-breeders have birds which
they favor during the period of growing, but
their real worth is proved by their perform-
ance in the single testing-pen.
Infertile eggs should be the aim of all pro-
ducers who grow eggs for table or commerce;
they keep longer in any weather, which gives
the consumer confidence, and that means
higher consumption and greater demand.
The male bird at the head of your breed-
ing-pen should be medium-sized, bright, active
and healthy, thoroughly masculine in appear-
ance and always ready to keep his end up
where another rooster is concerned. Avoid
any male bird that is flat-sided and weak-
kneed.
Always bear in mind that the chickens
hatched this year will be your main producers
and layers next year, so exercise all. the care
necessary in growing them well. Don’t force
them along too much. Give them ample room
and exercise. Don’t expect them to lay at 4|
to 5 months old, as only small eggs and poor
development are the result of this method,
with consequent loss of vitality.
WINTER FEEDING FOR FOWLS.
“M. 11.” : Let the early-morning feed con-
sist of bran and pollard mixed with warm
water in which chopped meat, liver, etc.,
have been boiled; midday, green feed such
as lucerne, kale or cabbage-leaves; evening,
a ration of two parts wheat, one part each
of maize and oats. The value of the maize
and oats is that it is heat-forming. Clean
water (with a little Epsom salts added once
a week) and grit should be always avail-
able. Make the houses free from draught,
with easterly aspect, and shut the birds off
pasture grass until the dew is gone. Where
frosts are prevalent, heavy-combed breeds
often suffer from frost-bite, which affects
laying and fertility of eggs. Apply vaseline
or lard to the frost-bitten combs, and do not
set any eggs until one month after treat-
ment.
WHEAT-GROWING IN QUEENSLAND.
“Peter P.”: Owing, among other things,
to the Queensland rainy months being dif-
ferent from those in the South, our method
of tillage has to be somewhat different also.
As soon as our wheat is harvested by reaper-
thresher the straw is burned, it being im-
portant to get a good, even burn over the
whole area. Better results are obtained if
the ground has a nice rain on it between
harvesting and burning. It is then turned
over as quickly as possible and the land
kept clean and worked after each rain, prin-
cipally by harrowing. The bulk of the
sowing does not take place until mid-June
and then the fastest wheats are sown. In
practice it has been proved that the shorter
the time between planting and harvesting
the better the results. It 'has been proved
also that farmers who follow these methods
can show as good an average return as those
southern farmers who practise fallowing.
The only wheat grown in the Darling Downs
these bad years just past has been grown
by these methods only. The reaper and
binder has fallen out of favor, not that it
is too costly, but that it lessens the chance
of a return the following year because it
does away with the stubble fire.
THE TURKEY.
“Jack Point”: Turkey-raising is not all
beer and skittles, as “T..J.” says (B.
2/6/’27), but it isn’t so much on account
of their proclivity for roaming as because
the dread blackhead disease is liable to break
out any time and wipe out the flock. Pretty
well everything is known about the disease
except how to cure it; as with nearly all
poultry ailments, the only satisfactory cure
is prevention. Recent American experi-
ments seem to prove that this is not at all
impossible. The disease is caused by a para-
site which is taken in by the turkeys with
their food ; but this parasite finds it much
easier to enter the turkey’s blood when
the intestines have been punctured by
another parasite, the caeca! worm, which
is only present when fowls are kept in the
same locality. So the first step in prevent-
ing blackhead is to get rid of the other
poultry. This was attended to in a recent
experiment at the Minnesota' Experiment
Station (U.S.A.), and the results have been
wonderful.
The keynote of success in turkey-farming
is just the same as in any other kind of
poultry-farming—absolute cleanliness and
still more cleanliness, sound feeding methods
and sensible breeding. Let the yards be
arranged so that the birds move to fresh
ground frequently, the old ground as they
leave it being planted with lucerne, rape,
etc. The feeding is practically the same as
for chickens, and special attention should be
paid to green feed, lucerne being the most
desirable. They are then easily reared.
There is a myth that turkey-eggs can’t be
hatched in incubators. Provided they are
not more than 10 days old, it is much better
to hatch them artificially, for exactly the
same reasons as it is to hatch any other
eggs that way. They should be hatched in
as big batches as possible, for it is no more
trouble to brood 50 than 20.
Of course, the market must be carefully
studied with a view to selling at the best pos-
sible prices, because this is practically the
sole source of income in turkey-farming. For
anyone within easy distance of a city there
is a nice little income, the only catch in it
being a rather common one—you have to
work for it and pay a lot of attention to
details.
VALUABLE ORCHARD WEEDS.
“Poncirus” : The best weed I know of in
the N. S. Wales coastal orchards is the
common yellow Cape weed —said to have been
introduced in chaff. It was well cursed for
years by the local orchardist, and vigorous
efforts were made to rid the orchards of it; but
now it is being blessed in many quarters. It
is excellent as an orchard green-manure crop,
making a dense mass of soft vegetation. Once
established it persists year after year, ger-
minating only in autumn after the heat of
summer, and at a time when the fruit-man’s
worries of cultivation and the conservation
of soil-moisture are over. If ploughed under
in early spring a huge mass of vegetable mat-
ter is added to the soil, thereby keeping up
the humus content and fertility. Usually
sufficient of the weed is missed in the first
ploughing of spring to re-seed for the follow-
ing autumn. Why buy grey peas, tick beans
or other green crop seed at high prices, with
the added expense of preparing the land and
planting, when here is a weed that does the
whole outfit at no cost? In some localities
the orchardists are actually top-dressing Cape
weed with sulphate of ammonia or nitrate
of soda to ensure a good crop.
SHEEP-STEALING BY MOTOR
TRUCK.
“N.G.”: Never before was sheep-stealing
so general in Australia, and it is the motor-
lorry that is the thieves’ accomplice. News-
papers applaud the up-to-date squatter who
adopts the petrol-waggon to move sheep
about. They know nothing of the parasites,
in the person of alleged rabbiters, who,
having removed the skins of many sheep
and buried their carcases, take the pelts in
their own lorries to the railhead, and there
consign them to firms that ask no questions.
Only this week I allowed some rabbiters
with a lorry to camp at a tank where sheep
come in—water being scarce on the run —and
warned them not to lay baits for foxes, it
being near mustering-time, when working
dogs might get poisoned. Next day I found
that they had laid poison, getting some foxes
and two sheep. I told them to burn the
sheep; this they disregarded, and used them
for bait. Later I found they had killed and
skinned a good many sheep, and had also
removed a lot of deal wool. They did not
at any time ask for meat—just killed their
own, so to say. “Their own,” in this case,
cost me a pound a head. No small pasto-
ralist can stand against such repeated depre-
dations. He spends his day pulling scrub
to keep sheep alive for the shearing; the
rabbiter spends his night killing and skin-
ning as many of them as he thinks he can
get away with. A good skin is worth Bs. to
10s.
Another point wants looking to. No
check is kept on sheep going from N.S.W.
into S. Australia. I once took a mob in,
right to the saleyards, and nobody asked
where they had come from. Undoubtedly
sheep are collected alive on big lorries from
squattages in N.S.W. and taken to some
quiet spot, from which they are driven to
market in South Aus. Not long back 500
were lost in this manner from one place, and
they were not missed in time to be recovered.
As sheep and wool are the staple products
of Australia—the credit on which Govern-
ments get loans—it seems to me that the
time is due for the stockbreeders to demand
a return to the old-time penalties for sheep-
and cattle-stealing—three, seven and ten
years.
THE DRIED-FRUITS INDUSTRY.
“Croesus” : That the Australian dried fruit
comes on the London market at a time when
the product of the Levant is getting stale
and grub-infested is one reason advanced by
“Fiat Lux" (P». 9/6/'27) for the soundness
of the Australian industry. But the Levant
stuff arrives when our# is stale and grubby
and in time to catch the most brisk trade
of the year. Further, the Greek stuff has
only half the distance to go.
Another reason put forward to support
the same contention is the flO-a-ton prefer-
ence tariff in England. But that is merely
a prop and only goes to show that the
industry cannot stand on its own founda-
tions.
Certainly the Australian pr?duct is the
cleaner. That, however, is but a small selling
point; it would be a difficult matter to per’
suade the average English working man
to refuse Greek fruits for his pudding by
telling him they are less clean. We cannot
induce the Australian public to give up buy-
ing dates, though they are really filthy. '
In reply to my suggestion (B. 14/4/'27)
that crops like tobacco, rice and cotton
should be tried as substitutes, “Fiat Lux”
says these three will not grow in Sunraysia.
If they will not, then other crops will. But
who knows that they will not, when the
only one that has been tried at all is cotton,
and that only in what did not amount to
much more than backyard experiments? It
was considered only as a side-line and was
discarded as much as anything for the reason
that it required attention when growers
would be busy with their vines. As a sub-
stitute crop it has not been properly tried,
the different varieties not having been experi
mented with, nor chemical analyses of soils
made in its interest. Anyhow, there has
been too much loose talk about what will
not grow in these districts. When I came
to them six years ago I was assured that
many things could not be grown there—
flowers, especially roses; passion-fruit; vege-
tables, particularly cauliflowers; and so on.
Now they are all grown. In fact, if seems
to me that the soil will grow almost any-
thing—given water and the necessary fer-
tiliser to make up a deficiency here and
there.
“Fiat Lux” admits that substitution of
crops is necessary and says that all growers
can do is to replace currant and gordo vines
with sultanas. But sultanas would also be
a losing proposition were they to lose the
artificial aid they receive from tariff prefer-
ence. They are an unsound substitute for
that reason. Further, it is difficult enough
now to get quit of the pack at satisfactory
prices, and it may be impossible if a greatly-
increased tonnage of sultanas is produced.
AN AUSTRALIAN IN SOUTH AFRICA.
“Warian” (S’Africa) : Australian sheep-
breeders need not have sleepless nights on
account of what is being done here. Cer-
tainly there has been wonderful progress
since the Boer War 20 years ago; but, then,
anyone could have improved the sheep of
that time with a few importations of decent
rams and ewes. The writer, coming from
Australia, has been mixed up with the indus-
try. throughout that period and knows every
stud in the Union. And the truth is that,
whilst South Africans, as a whole, are fair
sheepmen, a few being almost as good as
any in Australia, the rank and file are a
long way below the average, and the lack of
skill and knowledge have led them into many
mistakes. When they thought their sal-
vation lay in breeding rams carrying strong-
wool fleeces, they overdid it. Nothing could
be too strong for them; the result was in
many parts sheep carrying fleeces of 56’s and
58’s qualities, and being bred on country
heavily impregnated with lime they did not
get finer, but went coarse and harsh. They
have been trying to breed it out, but a big
quantity of this harsh, coarse wool is still
produced. The fine wools you hear the Brad-
ford people saying so much about is limited
in quantity, and it has a very low yield
compared with similar quality grown in
Australia. Owing to the veld having no
shelter, the wool picks up large quantities of
dust, and the weather, beating down. on the
backs of the sheep, in some parts gives the
wool a feeling as if it had been dipped in
tar and dried. There are no wools grown
equal to Tasmanian, Western Victorian or
New England, and never will be, as the
country can’t do it.
Then again, breeders have tried too many
“short cuts” to get what they want, and
there is hardly a stud with one pure line of
blood in the whole Union ; consequently one
sees such a mixture of blue, black and brind-
led that those who buy from these studs
soon become as bad. On top of this every
farmer who has a few fairly good sheep
thinks he is a stud breeder, and some of the
runts that are sent up to the annual sales
would be a reproach to any country.
The winters are the chief drawback to
sheep-breeding, as little, if any, provision in
me way of artificial feeding is made, and
then only by a very few. On the Karroo,
which is similar to the country in Northern
South Australia and Western N. S. Wales,
there is feed all the year round, if the
locusts don’t get it first; but the high alti-
tude in most places makes the winter very
severe.
Taken all round, Australia’s safety in the
wool business lies in the fact that, with
normal seasons she can feed her sheep well
all the year round, and has the advantage of
cleaner veld, a better system of paddocking

Its advantages over ring-oiler system
After 10 years’ use of the ring-oiler type of bearing in the bracket, the Lister changed to
the sight-feed lubrication system. This alteration was made purely as a result of an
appreciation of the conditions under which shearing machines usually work. The bracket,
from its position, is liable to be “out of sight, out of mind ’ —with serious results to the
bearing when the oil supply has run out. The bottle-fed system shows at a glance the
state of the oil supply and there is no excuse for overlooking this vital point.
Then, too, the Lister bracket does away with oil-splashed roof, floor, shearer and sheep
and slipping friction leathers, inevitable with the leaks from the ring-oiler bearing. In the
Lister bracket an overflow pipe conveys all surplus oil from the hanger-bearing to the
friction arm and thence to the friction spindle hearing by positive siphon-feed. This is
superior to the “needle-feed” used in some brackets, as there is no needle to jam and
block the oil.

Combs and Cutters
Lister Combs and Cutters are preferred—first, for the
exceptional steel from which they are made and
secondly, for the unique finish which distinguishes Listers
from all other Combs and Cutters. Points are fine, but
velvety smooth-—all ready to enter the wool. Combs are
thin enough to ensure clean cutting, but still have
sufficient metal to give long life. In any case Lister
steel keeps its edge longer, therefore loses less time and
money on the grinder.
Shearers or Shed-owners alike, ask for Listers!

lastly, she gets far higher yields from her
sheep and generally speaking better grown
wool with more tensile strength. -The who c
face of South Africa will need to be changed
before she can become a serious menace to
the woolgrowers of Australia.
FODDER OATS ON THE FARM.
“Glenfield”: Oats as fodder can be profit-
able on the Mallee farm as well as on the
sheep-station. In the Mallee there is on y
one sure way of harvesting oats, and that
is with the binder when the purple is in the
straw; then you get the lot. In a climate
where oats ripen rapidly and high winds are
frequent, T 5 per cent, of the ripened grain
can be lost in half a day. Once the hay is
cut and stacked the most profitable way to
get rid of it is to feed it as chaff to sheep;
the cash return is sure, and that way there
are no bad debts. With a hundred-acre pad-
dock sown with oats for pasture, and 200
acres of fallow to clean up, together with
six or eight portable self-feeders placed in a
sheltered spot and kept filled with oaten
chaff during the dry period, 250 lambing
ewes can be carried with safety on a 640-
acre block, where otherwise it would be
risky to carry more than 60 or 70. The sale
of the fat lambs phis the wool cheque from
the ewes makes a better propositilon than sell-
ing the chaff. And add to that the saving
of work on the fallow and the manuring by
the sheep.
RYELAND SHEEP.
“Tropex”: Australian and Maoriland
sheep-graziers are beginning to take a larger
interest in these sheep. Two important ship-
ments of the pure-breds have been made to
Victoria from England in the last 12 months,
and the Shaky Isles now carry a considerable
number.
The Ryeland comes from Plerefordshire,
and for centuries was counted as the best
wool-producer in the old land, the staple
being finer and denser and shorter than the
average of their breeds of sheep. Besides
this the mutton was of excellent flavor.
Density and compactness of both wool and
meat are the two outstanding qualities of the
breed; smallness of frame is its greatest
drawback. But want of size is not so very
great a drawback if the sheep is judiciously
crossed with other classes. A number of
Maorilanders find that the cross with some
of the bigger-framed sheep with tlie longer
wool gives an excellent progeny, particularly
the Romney Marsh cross. The infusion of
Ryeland blood does not seriously affect the
size nor the quick maturing quality of the
Romney: the carcase dresses a bit better
than expectations on account of the solidity
of the mutton; the wool from the grown
sheep is a very good sample of crossbred. The
Ryeland strain tends to shorten the staple
of the Romney, which usually grows too
long for its fibre quality, but the weight of
the fleece does not deteriorate because of the
added density.
In our fat-stock market, where the medium
weights are more saleable than the prime
weights, the Ryeland should be a success.
THE BLACKBERRY PEST.
“J.M.R.” : The greatest pest of settlers in
the hill country of Victoria is the black-
berry, which despite all efforts to combat it
continues to spread. Goats have been tried,
with a certain amount of success; but in
most cases their inability to get at the roots
makes their success only temporary. The
department has tried about 30 methods of
destruction, but one only promises anything
like eradication —the application of a solu-
tion of lib. each of arsenic and caustic soda
in five gallons of water. It costs about £4
an acre, and it promptly destroys 80 per-
cent. of the growth. It is the only mixture
that kills the deepest roots, and is applied
straight away, without any preliminary mat-
tocking.
SHEEP THAT MINE FOR A LIVING.
“G.G.6”: A recent Australasian To-
ported that a mob of Riverina ewes, about
1000, lately dug up the surface soils to a
depth of four or five inches over an area of
500 acres. This they did in search of roots
of edible plants, though there seems to have
been dry feed enough on the area.
The description of the sheep at work, dig-
ging up the soil with a forefoot, eating down
on the root, and then digging again till the
whole had been taken out, and raising clouds
of dust in the process, is most interesting.
But in saying that the instance quoted is the
only one on record the Australasian isn’t
correct. Here is another.
By the middle of 1899 the grass on the
blacksoil river-frontages to the Balonne, on
Noondoo station in s.w. Queensland, had
vanished—this was in the beginning of that
devastating drought which did not break till
four years later. Heavily carpeted in good
seasons with blue-grass, this country was
now as bare as a cinder-track, but was
pitted with holes five or six inches deep
where the tussock roots had been followed
down by the wretched sheep, as described
in the Riverina case. By that time all scrub
had been cut, and since conditions were much
the same up and down the river, and indeed
throughout Queensland —there was no rail to
Dirranbandi then —-nothing could be done
but watch tlie pitiful “mining” until the end
came with exhaustion.
PUNTS FOR THE FARM.
“Nota Bene”: For the best fire-beater you
need an oblong of green hide, about 20in. by
about 12in., and a light strong handle about
4ft. 6.in. long with a slot 6in. long sawn in
one end. The green hide, the 12in. side, is
slipped into this, and two rivets right
through stick and hide clench it tightly.
This can be used by horsemen. A grass fire
can be followed much more quickly on horse-
back, and the beaters, being light, can be
used from the saddle with one hand. On
our place the stockmen and boundary-riders
were furnished with two each man, the
second being for emergency or a volunteer.
“Spud” : The life of a farm horse in the
newer Mallee is surrounded by pitfalls dur-
ing summer and autumn. There is the risk of
sand being taken in with the scanty grazing.
It lodges in the pit of the stomach, forming
a solid mass, and is the cause of many
deaths. A healthy horse, which rolls heartily
on his back, will in most cases dislodge the
sand; but the low-conditioned animal which
has to scratch for a living has all the odds
against him. The best way to prevent the
sand lodging is to keep the horse in good
nick by supplementing the feed he is getting
in the paddock with good chaff mixed occa-
sionally with a little bran and Epsom salts
to keep the bowels active.
“S.”: Smutty chaff, although looked
on by most horsemen as harmless, has
this dry season almost wiped out some
teams. Chief Vet. Kendall (Vic.), who
investigated the matter, stated that ID
years out of 20 the same chaff would
not harm stock, but through these
horses being fed exclusively on it they had
contracted fodder-poisoning. The peculiar
feature of this poisoning was that all the
ordinary functions seemed normal, but when
the horse went down sick it could not rise
again.
“Kirk”: We have had the merits of
various fencing posts and droppers discussed.
Now what about staples, particularly those
used for split wooden droppers? Most con-
tract fencers prefer a light galvanised staple
cut to a fine point: but if the landholder
knows his business he will specify bright
staples. The galvanised staple will drive
into the droppers easily, but it also comes
out easily, while the bright staple, especially
if driven into green timber, will rust there
and be practically immovable.
“Kirk” : If slugs or other earth pests wolf
up the tasty carrot seedlings, try spraying
the ground previous to sowing with a solu-
tion of phenyle.
“Leo Lear”: The straight tip for count-
ing sheep given by “Two Seas” (B.
9/6/’27) needs one important addition —
stand well back; no one can count success-
fully when the woollies rush under one’s
nose. Also experience is not everything;
some men will never count; ’tain’t in ’em ;
others are good from the jump. But tell the
newclium this—don’t start on lambs; they
do need a humanised ready-reckoner.
“J.G.”: Sometimes a strong cable is
wanted for the forest devil, or stump-puller.
Make it out of fencing-wire. Got four, five,
six or any number of wires according to the
strength of the cable desired, and cut a
little longer than the length of cable wanted.
Fasten one lot of ends to a tree, fence, stump
or anything firm; the other lot to a dray-
wheel, one wire end to each spoke. Now
jack the wheel up, and turn it round and
round until the wires have been twisted into
a neat cable. The breaking strain of six
No. 8 wires thus twisted is tremendous.
“Buttenderry”: Those who argue that,
because they find it more difficult to poison
dingoes than foxes, the dingo must be more
cunning than the fox, probably go about the
job in the wrong way. Dingoes hunt in
packs, and almost invariably the leader of
the pack will keep his followers at a respect-
full distance while he eats his fill. Should
his meal be poisoned, his fate will warn the
others. To get over the difficulty, cut 50
or 60 hunks of meat from the carcase, poison
them all and scatter them about, thus allow-
ing all the dogs to feed simultaneously. The
manager of a Northern River station and I
treated an old “lumpy” in this way, and next
morning counted 27 dead dingoes within a
very small radius.
“,T.G.” : Here is a useful method of bind-
ing a split fencing-post, or a broken fence-
rail, or even a split tool-handle. Get a
piece of wire a little longer than required
to go twice round the object to be bound.
Now double the piece of wire and pass it
round, say, a post that has split; hold the
two single ends of the wire in one hand;
bring the loop end over the tw r o single ends;
place a short bar of round iron, such as
an old bolt, in the loop and twist it round
and round the two single ends of wire, which
are firmly held in the left hand. If properly
done, this tie will bring two objects together
as well as any bolt and nut and in some
cases make a better job. The surplus ends
can be cut off after the splice is made. Care
should be taken not to twdst too far. other-
wise the wire will break; stop twisting as
soon as the two objects have been drawn
tightly together.
“Rab Haw”: “X2X” (B. 2G/5/’27)
parades that fabulous monstrosity the
jumart, and writes with the conviction appa-
rently that such an animal exists. lake
the unicorn, the Holy Grail, and Jason’s
Golden Fleece, the jumart was conceived in
the brain of man, and duly born. It will
live for all time, but not in flesh and blood.
These it has not possessed and never will.
$ * * *
“Bendee”: “X2X” (B. 26/5/’27) on
jumarts reminds me that many of the Indian
“mule-Johnnies” on Anzac assured us that
it was not an unheard-of thing for their
mules to reproduce themselves, provided they
were of the stallion-Jenny cross, but that
the donkey-mare cross never did so. Can
anyone verify this?
* * * *
“R. J.”: The Hawkosbury College is
credited with £275 from a quarter-acre of
tomato plants, and a Bathurst grower took
£lOl3 off an acre. The largest return, so
far as I know, is claimed by a Victorian
grower, who made £BOO from a quarter-acre.
This seems incredible; but. then, tomatoes
have been known to yield up to 3000 half-
bushel cases per acre, and prices for the
early crop soar to over £1 per half-busliel.
In a test conducted at Bowen (N.Q.), under
Government supervision, a yield of three
half-b'ishel cases per plant was obtained.
* * * *
“Spud”: I think “Glenfield” (B. 9/6/'27)
is wrong re sowing or waiting during this
dry spell in n.-w. Mallee (Vic.). The man
in the best position is the one with all his
ground nicely worked up and not a grain
sown ; for when the good rain does come it
won’t take him long, especially if he has
a combine, to whip his crop in, and he will
know that what he sows will come up. If
it does not rain in time to sow—well, he
will still have his seed and manure on the
stand, and a good start with his fallow for
next year. Fallowing will not be delayed,
for whilst waiting for the long-delayed wet-
ness, a preliminary canter can be taken over
the land to be fallowed with the springtooth,
scarifier or whatever implement is available,
and while things are dry it will be as good
as summer fallow.

He met me in King-street one evening,
and in his apologetic way spoke his little

“I am sorry, my friend,” I replied; “there's
. a restaurant across the street,” giving him
the needful.
A few evenings later a voice that I seemed
to have heard before said, “Pardon me, sir,
have you ever known what”
“See here, my friend,” I interrupted, “you
want to vary your introductory remarks.
There’s a pub on the corner and you’ll be
in time, if you hurry,” giving him the small
coin necessary to allay his thirst.
Not a week later lie crossed the street
diagonally so as to meet me accidentally
on the other side.
“Pardon me, sir,” said the familiar voice,
“have yon ever known what”
“Ah,” I said —“it was hunger first time
thirst the next. What is the Great Mis-
fortune this time?”
He looked at me sadly. “Not merely
hunger,” he said; “not merely thirst. Twins
this time” —and he hold out his hand as one
assured of success.

Linked tram-cars crawl to Dulwich Hill;
The same cars go to Marrickville—
For all I know they’re running still.
Though Dulwich Hill may put on frill,

For they are linked, for good or ill.
More people live in Marrickville.
But residents of Dulwich Hill
Reside in pride and take their fill .
Of living out of Marrickville.
But Marrickville has no ill-will
Against the folk of Dulwich Hill;
And Jack and Jill do not instill
Into the lads of Marrickville
A hatred deep of Dulwich Hill.
But I am troubled greatly still
Why people live in Marrickville,
Or why they live in Dulwich Hill.
Some day I’ll venture on a thrill
And take that crawling tram, I will,
And I’ll discover Marrickville,
Interrogating Jim and Bill
Why they should live in Marrickville,
And why they do not put on frill.
But no, that impulse I shall kill
To re-discover Dulwich Hill.
Anticipation’s better still
So I shall gladly wait until
My dying day, when I shall fill
My mind with thoughts of Dulwich Hill,
With —intermingled—Marrickville,
That I have never seen, nor will!

This, in brief, is Old Court’s story.
Never is a drop of this fine Australian

Lying Reports.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PATROL-officer Jimmy Tupper liad hardly
become accustomed to the novelty of
having his boots cleaned by a fierce-eyed,
hook-nosed savage in uniform when fortui-
tous circumstance and the exigencies of the
service made him acting-assistant resident
magistrate at Gabatumu. Iviwai corporals,
Gosiago lance-jacks and privates from the
Barnu no longer referred to him slightingly
as the “small-fella Gov’ment,” but stepped
out smartly and unexpectedly from odd cor-
ners of the parade-ground, clicking their heels
and saluting him as Number One with un-
mistakable cordiality. Even Sergeant Siosi,
to whom new-chum patrol-officers were very
small fry indeed, reacted in divers ways as
flattering as they were embarrassing to
Jimmy Tapper's altered status. A very
wise, very far-seeing old bird was Sergeant
Siosi of the Armed Native Constabulary.
Tapper’s predecessor, a long-legged, liard-
eyed, "walk-about” magistrate of the old
school, had given him much friendly advice
before leaving for Port Moresby.
“Don’t spend too much time on the sta-
tion,” he had said, “and don’t worry the
mountain people for a while, at least. I’ve
taught ’em to fear the Lord and love the
Government, and they’ll give no trouble.
Keep a tight rein on the Akuaku crowd —
they want a new village constable, by the
way—and don’t fall foul of the missions. The
white men are all good fellows, but the South
Sea teachers are sometimes a little —er —
difficult; but treat ’em gentle. As for
Sergeant Siosi,” he had wound up, regarding
that imperturbable old warrior speculatively,
“I don’t know whether to recommend him
for a rise or to knock his block off! Perhaps
you may weigh him up.”
“Akuaku!” To Jimmy Tupper the mere
name was a lure, an enticement, seeming to
breathe the very spirit of primitive Papua.
He cleared his throat loudly.
“Sergeant!” he called.
“Sail!” Sergeant Siosi stumped in and
saluted.
“How far Akuaku, sergeant?”
“ ’Bout three-four day, sail,” answered
Siosi.
“Good! To-morrow sun-he-come-up we go
Vkuaku. Round up twenty strong village
.'.en for carriers.”
So it happened that on the fourth day
Tupper and his detachment marched into
Akuaku. Grass-kirtled women, laboring
patiently in the gardens, straightened their
backs and gave them “Tinanihi” [good dayj
shyly. Spindle-shanked little boys with dis-
tended stomachs lay basking lazily on the
shingle in the tropic sunshine. Pigs rooted
among the garbage which littered the street;
mangy curs of fearful and wonderful breed
yelped under the grass-tliatclied huts; but of
the menfolk there was not a sign.
“Go, Baragi, Ahobu, Asiai!” he called to
the police.' “Tell the hanua taudia [village
people] that the Government is here.”
In groups of twos and threes the villagers,
their eyes heavy with sleep and the chewing
of much betel-nut, drifted to the rest-house,
and lounged about in sullen silence. In half
an hour, the male population was crowded in
the compound and the air became heavy with
the reek of sweating, unclothed bodies.
“You savee these people’s language, ser-
geant?” asked the magistrate.
Siosi elevated his eyebrows, expressing a
bored affirmative.
“Tell them that I am going to appoint a
‘hanua policeman’ [village constable] to
wear the Government clothes, carry the Gov-
ernment book and the Government hand-
cuffs.”
Siosi translated the message, and, after a
noisy discussion, a crafty-eyed old rascal
shouldered his way through the crowd and
climbed to the verandah. He squatted on the
split-palm floor, discharged a stream of crim-
son-flecked saliva to the ground below, and
wiped his mouth with the back of a dirty
hand. Siosi glared, and the candidate
scrambled hastily to his feet.
Tupper, like most young Austral-Papuans,
believed himself to be a profound Motuan
scholar. Actually he had only a few vag-
rant phrases of the bat spoken by the police,
and he loved to parade them. He took from
his despatch-box a manuscript book bound
in oiled cloth, and opened it at the first
page.
"Now, my boy,” lie began. “Oi diba Motu
gada?”
"10, taubada,” answered the native.
“Goodo!” breathed Tupper, and he wrote
clearly: “Speaks Motuan.”
“Oi diba taukorokoro gada?”
“My word!” was the prompt response. “I
savee too much white man’s talk.”
“Fine!” said Tupper. And he wrote,
“Speaks English.”
“Name b’long me Kadoa,” volunteered the
man. “More better you put him ’long book.”
Tupper entered the name, blotted the
entries carefully and handed the book to
Kadoa. Sergeant Siosi disdainfully tossed
him an unbraided blue-serge sulu and jumper.
Then he removed a pair of handcuffs from his
belt, passed the key to Tupper and tossed
the at Kadoa’s feet.
“Speak to Kadoa the words of the Gov-
ernment, sergeant,” ordered Tupper. “Tell
him in his own tongue that he is the ‘hanua
policeman’; that he is to make clean the vil-
lage and rebuild the rest-house; that he is
to keep order in the village, prevent fights
and riots, weed the roads, and arrest all evil-
doers. Warn him also to deal ‘strong’ with
all who spread lying reports, thereby making
trouble amongst the people, and wearying the
Government with false tales.”
The sergeant leaned his carbine against the
sago-spathe wall, and called Kadoa to atten-
tion.
"Oh, Kadoa, and you Akuaku men!” he
began. “Hear the commands of the magis-
trate who speaks wise words. Kadoa is a
thief and a great liar, nevertheless he is made
hanua policeman. He shall not wear the
Government clothes until lie has washed him-
self with soap. He shall bring taro, yams,
sugar-cane and betel-nut when the sun goes
down, for the police are hungry for New
Guinea food. To-morrow he. shall cause you
to clean up the village because of its vile
smell; also, he shall sell me a young dog—
cheap—good for pig-liunting. Kadoa will
put the handcuffs on men who fight, and on
women who talk too much, and the police will
beat them with sticks, maybe. Kadoa is a
fool and the son of a fool; nevertheless, if
evil men spread lying reports about the Gov-
ernment, or about the- police, or about the
people, they shall be arrested and put in gaol.
Eor all these things Kadoa will receive money
at the end of twelve moons, and shall give
TRAINED TO THE JOB.
“That new cove ain’t going to give much trouble, Dave — he’s a good, steady milker.”
“My oath. He’s been well cowed.”
me a present of betel-nut whenever I come
to Akuaku. Also the magistrate wants two
young fowls, for which he will pay six sticks,
or three sticks if they be old and stringy.”
Siosi stopped, and turned to Tupper.
“I bin tell him everything you said, sah,”
he reported.
“You savee good, Kadoa?” asked Tupper.
“I savee,” answered the new “V.C.” “I
savee too”
“Shut up!” interrupted Siosi rudely.
“Bring the betel-nut to the barracks, for my
belly is sore with much talking.”
The villagers tiled out of the compound
and dispersed to their huts in chattering
groups. The police rigged Tupper’s stretcher
and mosquito-net, and prepared their camp
in the barracks. Tupper sat on a tucker-
box and unwound his puttees thoughtfully.
He felt that his first administrative function
had passed off very successfully, especially as
the Akuaku tribe bore an evil name amongst
the coastal people.
“Treat them with tact,” he thought, “and
don't come the bounce, and one can do
anything with natives.”
“Good-day, mister,” bleated a voice from
below, and a portly Samoan mission teacher,
clad in a spotless white loincloth and cotton
singlet, climbed up the steps, breathing
heavily and smiling expansively. He thrust
out a podgy brown hand and shook Tupper’s
warmly.
“Who the dickens are you?” asked the
magistrate.
“Ah, mister!” replied the visitor, “I am
Ezekiel, the teacher for these people. They
are very bad people, mister.”
“So I am told,” answered Tapper. “What
can I do for you, Ezekiel?”
“I am very good friend for the Govern-
ment, mister,” replied the teacher. “The
Government likes for village people come
church; but these people no come. No, mis-
ter ! I ring bell; I talk strong English
swears, mister, but these people say ‘Go
’way! we no savee. Besides, you fat, like
pig!’ I very sorry for these people, mister;
they very bad people.”
Tupper laughed. “I’m afraid I can't
order them to attend church, Ezekiel; but
I'll see what I can do for you. I'll talk to
Ivadoa, the new ‘V.C.’ Perhaps he'll be able
to help you.”
Ezekiel raised his fat hands in horror.
“Ivadoa, mister!” he wailed. “My good
gracious dashitall! Ivadoa is very bad man,
mister. I married to his sister, and still I
owe Ivadoa one pig; I no pay yet, but by-
and-bye—perhaps.” lie stuck out his finger
and poked Tupper in the chest confiden-
tially. “Mister,” he whispered, “you the
Government magistrate; suppose you talk
Ivadoa I no pay this pig, hey? Plenty pig,
plenty armshell, plenty tobacco I pay for
marry this girl. Everything I pay up square
except this one pig, and Ivadoa he very wild
for me.”
“I should think so. too,” snorted Tupper.
“Why don’t you keep your word, and pay
the man his pig?”
“Ah, mister,” replied the teacher, “you no
savee these people all same I do ; they very
bad people, I tell you—very bad.”
“They must be,” agreed Tapper drily.
“Thank you, mister,” replied Ezekiel as he
rose to leave. “Some day I come station,
and we talk again about this pig. You
Government magistrate, and Kadoa he hear
your talk. Suppose you say, ‘All right,
Kadoa! Ezekiel no pay; everything square,’
Kadoa he too fright for make trouble, and
we two very good friends —see?”
“Get out,” snapped the magistrate, “you
—you dashed old humbug!”
=i= * :|! #
Tupper had been tax-collecting. On his
table were little stacks of shillings and bundles
of discolored notes. From the parade-ground
came the hoarse voice of Sergeant Siosi, drill-
ing the police. Suddenly the sergeant’s voice
ceased, and there came a roar of laughter
from the squad, followed by the sound of a
scuffle and an expostulating voice bleating
tearfully—a voice which to Tupper seemed
vaguely familiar. He walked out on to the
verandah to see a strange procession headed
for the office. In the lead was Kadoa, the
village constable, his new uniform torn and
dust-stained. By his side, weeping and per-
spiring, was Ezekiel. And he was hand-
cuffed to the village policeman. Sergeant
Siosi, the laughing police, half a dozen out-
raged convicts and the station cook brought
up the rear.
Tupper returned to his chair and waited.
In a few minutes the procession reached
the office. Siosi ordered the police to dis-
perse and the convicts back to work, and
led in Ivadoa and his tearful prisoner.
“What’s the troubleV” asked Tapper.
“Oh, mister!” wailed Ezekiel.
“Shut up!” grunted Kadoa. “You pri-
soner, savee ?”
“Out with it, Kadoa !” rasped the magis-
trate. “Come on, quick time!”
Kadoa straightened himself, took a deep
breath, and commenced:
“Taubada, this man owe me one-fella pig.”
“I know,” said Tupper. “Go on.”
“Ezekiel say, ‘Why for you no come
church? You come church or I talk Govern-
ment, and you losem clothes [get dis-
missed].’ ”
“Yes?” queried Tupper. “Go on.”
“One day I go church with my new clothes
and book and handcuffs and everything. All
the people go, too. I think, maybe, Ezekiel
pay me this pig, s'pose I go church.”
lie paused, and Ezekiel, seizing the open-
ing. took up the tale.
"I make sing, mister; and all the people
sing. I make talk, mister —strong talk —
and all the people hear me.”
“What kind of strong talk?” asked Tupper.
“Good talk, mister. I say, ‘Suppose you
Akuaku people no come church every day,
and sometimes twice, big trouble will come.
The devil will get you some day, and you
Akuaku people will all burn up together.’
And when Kadoa hear me,” Ezekiel’s voice
broke, and tears came into his eyes, “he put
handcuffs on me, mister, and drag me tliree-
four day to the Government station. I
want law, mister, good Government law for
this Kadoa, who is very bad man.”
“Why did you arrest him, Kadoa?” asked
Tupper curiously.
“Because you bin talk all same, taubada.
Ezekiel say s’pose Akuaku people no come
church, by-and-bye one big-fella devil he
come burnem up altogether man, altogether
woman, altogether piccaninny. I hear Eze-
kiel talk this fashion, I make him fast ’long
handcuffs one time, and bring him ’long
you.”
Tupper looked puzzled. “But why, man?
Why?”
Ivadoa’s thick lips moved slowly as if re-
hearsing unfamiliar words.
“For—for —se-preading lying reports, tau-
bada.” he shouted triumphantly.
“Holy suffering cats!” gasped Tupper.
Sergeant Siosi grinned. “My word, sail,”
he remarked blandly, “now we catchem big-
fella trouble, I t’ink so.”
He moved to Tupper’s side and spoke to
him earnestly in a low voice. A doubting
expression chased across Tupper’s face, and
he frowned, shaking his head emphatically.
Siosi’s voice became lower, more insistent,
and presently the magistrate smiled, then
laughed aloud.
“Righto!” he said. He counted out five
one-pound notes from the bundle lying on the
table. “It is in my mind, Ezekiel, and you,
Kadoa,” lie continued, “that the matter of
the pig must be made square, that there
may be no more trouble between—-er—
Church and State at Akuaku. The Govern-
ment will pay Kadoa for the pig, thus can-
celling Ezekiel’s debt, and Ezekiel will forget
that lie has been arrested wrongfully for
—er —spreading lying reports.” He handed
the money to Kadoa. “Now, buzz off!” he
rasped.
When they had gone Jimmy Tupper,
A.R.M., settled back in his chair with a sigh
of relief. If the story of Ivadoa’s mis-
directed zeal had leaked out. and Ezekiel
had refused to be squared, he, Tupper, would
have received a severe reprimand from head-
quarters. Lucky indeed if he were not dis-
rated. Spreading lying reports! As lie
made good the shortage in his cash from his
own slim wallet he marvelled at the astute-
ness of Sergeant Siosi. He would have mar-
velled still more if lie had seen that canny
warrior and his late visitors in a secluded
corner of the parade-ground a few minutes
later.
“Kadoa,” the sergeant was saying, “if I,
Siosi, had not counselled the young magis-
trate with wise words, you would have got
-—what?”
“Nothing, sergeant,” answered Kadoa
promptly.
“\vrong!” corrected the sergeant. “Six
months would have been your portion for
bringing shame upon the Government.” lie
turned to Ezekiel.
“And you. Man of Fat? What”
“I am well content,” wheezed the teacher
hastily.
“Then.” said Siosi, deftly flicking the notes
from Kadoa’s pouch, “is it not just if I claim
a reward for my good works?” He pointed
to the chevrons on his arm. “One pound
for each stripe and two for Kadoa, hey? Is
it not just?’
Kadoa swallowed hard. “It is just, ser-
geant,” he admitttd.
“Most just indeed !” said Ezekiel.
Siosi twisted the notes into a slim cylinder
and thrust it through the pierced septum
of his nose.
“My oat’ it is!” he agreed handsomely.
“Dis -miss!”

A cure for chilblains. —713.
When a chilblain is threatening the best
application generally is belladonna liniment
and turpentine liniment mixed in equal
parts. Brush it over the skin and allow it
to dry on. A plan that may be tried is the
following: Soak the feet or fingers for two
or three minutes every night in a cold
saturated solution of rock salt. Then rub
with cold towels until the skin feels warm.
I have seen in the press that Garavonica
and Sea Island cotton are drought resistant
and require little cultivation. I have applied
for a small area to test the proposition. (1)
Do these varieties merely require holes 1 ft.
sq., Tin. deep and sft. apart, with three seeds
in each hole, and little attention except prun-
ing for the first two years? (2) Has any
grower in Australia got these varieties under
crop ? —<>32.
Sea Island is not a drought-resistant
variety. It is a small-boiled cotton, grown
along the sea-coast under ample rainfall con-
ditions. When grown inland the fibres be-
come harsh, weak and nearly worthless. Cara-
vonica is a tree-cotton variety, formerly
grown in the Cairns district, but is not a
commercial cotton now. Where cotton' is
grown in any manner approaching that de-
scribed the yields arc low and the cotton is
grown by the lowest class of native labor,
such as that found in the inland districts of
Brazil.
(1) Will tobacco grow and show a profit
in a coastal district where the rainfall is
between 70 and IXfi'n. p.a.f (2) Can leaf be
dried in aforesaid climate, or would buyers
buy the leaf straight from the plant? (3)
What is the process for drying? Is machinery
necessary? (4) What variety is recommended
by buyers? —63l.
(1) No attempt has yet been made to
grow pipe tobacco-leaf commercially in a
Queensland coastal district with rainfall be-
tween 70 and 90 in. p.a. The conditions
existing in such localities are likely to produce
nothing but a coarse, low-grade leaf. (2) Air-
dried leaf is not favored by manufacturers.
Flue-curing is essential. Buyers don’t as a rule
purchase leaf straight from the plant. It
must be cured and graded. (3) Dept, of
Agriculture and Stock, Brisbane, will supply,
on application, a pamphlet on tobacco-
growing and -curing. No machinery is in-
volved in process of curing. (4) Tobacco-
seed of choice varieties is imported from
U.S.A. by Dept, of Agriculture, Brisbane,
for sale at 3s. per oz., post. paid.
Tell me how to tan hides. —706.
Should the hide be dry or salted soak well
in cool, clean water. When it is soft, free
from blood and salt, place in a suitable con-
tainer —do not use iron unless none other
is obtainable —cover with water and add lib.
unslaked lime for every 5011 i. hide. If sul-
phide of sodium is available use fib. lime and
2oz. sodium. The soak is finished when the
hair readily comes out. Scrape with any
blunt instrument. Wattle-bark ground finely
should now be spread over the hide lightly,
covered with water and left for a week. Put
the hide in a weak liquor of bark and water,
21b. to 20 gallons, for the first week and the
succeeding weeks increase the liquor up to
71b. to 20 gallons. The tanning for light hides
takes eight weeks. The longer in the liquors,
the better the result. Now dry in a shady
draughty place. The rolling of the leather
needs a fast revolving weighted roller; but
as this is not obtainable outside tanneries, a
heavy log, round and smooth, will produce a
finished article. But without a good roller
much care and hard work is required to get
the leather firm and hard.
Wishing to become a naturalised Austra-
lian citizen, how do I proceed? —694A.
Apply to Dept, of Home and Territories,
61 Spring-street, Melbourne. Declare (a)
your intention of settling in the British
Empire, and (b) that you have resided within
the Commonwealth continuously for one year
and within the Empire during four of the
eight years preceding the date of application,
(c) You must abjure former allegiance and
take an oath of allegiance to the reigning
sovereign. (d) You must advertise your
intention to seek naturalisation, produce
certificates of good character, declare
certain personal particulars and satisfy the
authorities that you can read and write
English.
Book on the dentition of sheep. I want
to fatten some old broken-mouth sheep and
will hare to treat incisors and molars as
i cell. What instruments will he necessary
and from whom obtainable and cost ? —691.
The Chief Veterinary Surgeon, N.S.VV.
Dept, of Agriculture, states that there is
no work known to him on this subject, nor
does lie know any instruments that can be
obtained for the purpose. Improvise your
own instruments, he suggests. The molar
teeth might be rasped, using a piece of wood
for a mouth gag.
/ bought a house and erected a boundary
fence. After 10 years tire adjoining land
■was taken up and built on. I received no-
thing for the fence\ Present occupier says
he owns half of it, as it became his when he
bought the house. How do we stand? —004.
The Dividing Fences Act 1902 (N.S.W.),
provides: “If any person encloses his lands
before the lands immediately adjoining have
been duly granted by the Crown or other-
wise held as private property, the owner of
lands so enclosed may claim and recover
from tile person who afterwards becomes the
proprietor of such adjoining lands one half
of the actual value of the wall, hedge or
fence forming the dividing line or fence
between the said adjoining lands.” Provision
is made for the actual value being determined
(in the event of disagreement between the
parties) “by the arbitration of two persons
to be mutually chosen by the parties.”
I have (in N.S.W.) a vacant block, My
neighbor erected a fence without my know-
ledge, and only notified me after completion.
Price asked then was too high. I wrote offer-
ing to pay half usual cost. But am I liable,
seeing notice of erection was not given?
Would I be liable if erector allowed six
months to elapse, and then made claim t —665.
The owner of the adjoining land before
putting up the fence should have served a
notice on you to assist in equal proportions.
The Dividing Fences Act of 1902 (N.S.W.)
allows you six months in which to comply
with this notice. After the lapse of that
time, should you not have complied, he may
carry out the job himself and recover from
you. As no such notice appears to have been
given, it rests with the neighbor to show
what, if any, claim he has against you. If.
as an act of grace, yon decide to pay half
the cost, you should do so only on production
of receipted account for work and material.
Would country store doing turnover £lOO
week ( rent 255.) keep man and wife, male
assistant and. lady ditto? —535.
A good profitable country business should
show 19 or 20 per cent, gross, but canvassing,
delivery, etc., frequently run 15, 16 or 17 per
cent. Whether the business you refer to
would show 20 per cent, gross is unknown.
Many of these businesses in selling make a
parade of their turnover, but neglect to say
what proportion of the turnover consists of
produce, sugar, kerosene and similar lines,
carrying very small profit. Presuming the
business shows 20 per cent, gross, this would
be £lO4O gross p.a. Expenses to be reckoned
on (inc. figures given) would be: Wages,
£364; rent, £65 ; ins. of stock, £25 (country
rates run up to 50s. p.c.) ; horse and cart,
£100; bad debts, say, £5O; sundries (rates,
etc.), £100; total, £704. This would be con-
ditional upon the 20 per cent, being earned.
The purchaser might make a living out of it,
but conditions would have to be very favor-
able. Incidentally, the wage for a senior
hand is £4 15s. in the city, and is generally
not less in the country.
What are the distances in professional
revolver-shooting competitions? Size of bull’s-
eyes? Existing records for Australia? Arc
there any regular competitions in Australia
open to the public? —6Bo.
The National Rifle Association used to
hold such competitions, but they were discon-
tinued on account of lack of patronage. The
dimensions of the divisions of the targets used
at Bisley (Eng.) are: At 10yds. : Ist circle,
14in.; 2nd, 3in.; 3rd, 44in.; 4th, 6in.; re-
mainder, 134 sq. in. At 20yds.: Ist, 2in. ; 2nd,
3iin.; 3rd, 54in.; 4th, 74in.; remainder,
134 sq. in. At 50yds.: Ist, sin.; 2nd, Bin.;
3rd, 12in.; 4tli, 16in.; remainder, 24 sq. in.
No Australian records are available, but in
England competitors have frequently scored
the possible.
Where can I buy subterranean clover-
seed ? —6S4.
Yates (Sydney); Brunnings or Daw
Sumner ( Melbourne) ; or to go to the grower,.
C. Howard, Mount Barker (S.A.)—orders
may be booked with Dalgety’s, Adelaide.
Prices from 3s. to 2s. 3d. per lb.
Where could I find out particulars of an
old English will? —688.
Write Principal Registrar of Wills, Somer-
set House, London ; ask for a certified copy
of the will. The charge is 9d. a folio (90

help, too.
An Edinburgh boy (18), keen on farming,
wants a job in Australia. Do you advise
training at Agricultural College, Edinburgh,
or going straight to Australia? (b) Where
can further information be obtained? Has
no capital. —67o.
(a) Come straight away and adapt himself
to local conditions. Since 1925 Federal and
Imperial Governments contribute towards
assisted passages for approved persons, bal-
ance being paid by the immigrant or his
nominator. In the case of this boy, £ll
would have to be paid, (b) Further infor-
mation from Director of Migration and
Settlement. Australia House, London; or
Deputy-Director. Immigration Office, Collins-
place, Melbourne.
Any forestry openings in Australia for
a B.tic. (Forestry) of Edinburgh University;
one year post-graduate work at Oxford and
six months in Malayan Forest Service?
Where may further information be sought ?—
670 a.
N.S.W. Forestry Commission says that, in
view of lack of local experience, there is no
opening at present, Australian forest condi-
tions being totally unlike those of other parts
of the world. Federal Government is train-
ing men at Australian Forest School, Can-
berra, the different States nominating a cer-
tain number of students annually, who must
have completed a science course at one of the
universities; so the prospect for outsiders
does not seem bright. No harm would be
done, however, in making application to the
Forestry Departments of the other States.
Motor-driven crosscut saws used to be
advertised, but have apparently dropped out.
Why? Are they still sold? —689.
“New Record'* (Buzacott’s, 7-11 Market-
street, Sydney). “Hercules” (Moffat-Virtue,
Palmer-street, Sydney) ; “Wade” (W. G.
Watson, Ltd., Kent-street, Sydney). The
“Vaughan” used to be but is no longer on
the local market. The “New Record” is the
only Australian-made saw among them.
How can I make sure that I am building
a 10 x 10 room square, with only bush tools?

care to keep both nails the same distance
from the edge of the timber. To one tie
a piece of string 6ft. long, to the other one
a piece 10ft. long. Then make a triangle
of the timber and the two strings. The
short string will be at right-angles to the
timber.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The crowd at Moonee Valley (Vic.) on
Saturday witnessed a good Grand National
trial when Woolpack (7 to" 2) ran away
with the Windarra Hurdle, two miles, in
the course-record time of 3min. 38|sec. Tan-
tram’s gelding had finished a good fourth in
the Toolambool Hurdle at Caulfield the pre-
vious Saturday, but most backers went for
the unlucky Jollity, who closed at 2 to 1,
Glen Costa being at 4 to 1 and the rest
(11 of them) at double figures. Woolpack
took the lead at the seven-furlong post, and
thenceforward gave nothing else a chance;
he won by six lengths from Nelanjie (20 to
1), with Jollity three lengths away. The win-
ner carried 31b. more than his National
weight, 10st., and his price naturally short-
ened after the race. Still, hurdlers that put
up dashing two-mile performances rarely
shine in the more arduous three-mile race at
Flemington.
There were some top-notch fencers among
the 11 starters for the Travancore Steeple,
2 miles 8 chains. Nyangay went out a solid
favorite at 5 to 2; the Caulfield winner,
Derision, was next in favor at 5 to 1, and
Glentronie followed at 6 to 1. There were
few inquiries for Mendit, who was making
his first appearance in Melbourne. The race
was a spectacular affair, with Nyangay and
Glentronie the cleverest jumpers. The latter
had too much pace for the favorite, and,
going to the front six furlongs from home,
was never afterwards headed, beating Nyan-
gay by 3 lengths and Welcome Stranger (8
to 1) by another 5 lengths. Mendit did well
until he came a cropper at the last obstacle
but one. He was not hurt, nor will he lack
friends for the Grand National. Glentronie,
who had scored at Sandown earlier in the
week, is an aged gelding by Governor Bligh
—Rathburn, and is in the big Flemington
steeple with 9st. 31b., 71b. less than he bore
to victory. He was ridden by Don Zeally,
whose followers had a good day, for he had
been successful on Woolpack. The time was
4min. 22isec.
There was a plunge on Deauville (3 to 1)
in the Jumpers’ Flat, but long-priced ones
filled the places, George Leonard’s mount
Royan (20 to 1) winning from Leura Rose
(14 to 1) and Pixie Lad (15 to 1). Royan
is a half-brother to Rivoli, and did his. early
racing in Sydney. He is not engaged in the
National. Sailing Home (5 to 1) made some
atonement for many disappointments by
leading all the way in the Deep Creek Han-
dicap, 10 furlongs, but he had only a neck
to spare from an outsider, Segna (16 to 1),
Dukedom (6 to 1) being a poor third.
Pytchley (20 to 1) beat a hot favorite, Swit-
zerland (7 to 1), in the Chandos Handicap.
The only crumb of comfort backers of favor-
ites obtained was when Ilonorium and Rug-
byean, each 4 to 1, dead-heated in the Green-
vale Welter, the owners dividing. Rugbyean
is a brother to All Sunshine, and Erie Con-
nolly has stuck to him in spite of many
failures.
Hs * *
T. M. Burke, who had set his heart on
winning the G.N. Hurdle with the nicely-
handicapped Bombard, had to put the pen
through his horse’s name on Monday, the
injury sustained at Caulfield not having
yielded to treatment. Another who dis-
appeared from all engagements was J. E.
Brewer’s Micronesia. With Roisel (list.
51b.), Pildin (list. 41b. 1 and Grosvenor
(list, lib.) in the field there will be no
lack of class, and lightweights like Woolpack
(10st.), Jollity (9st. 101 b.), Tclarno (9st.
111 b.), Seafit (9st. 51b.) and Nobility (9st.
21b.) will test the 11-stoners. Grosvenor
proved himself a first-class hurdler at the
recent Randwick meetings, and his appear-
ance suggested then that he could still be
improved. Victoria’s best representative will
perhaps be Telarno, who has won over the
distance, has been running on in recent
races, and will carry the Holt polish. Selec-
tions for the first day at Flemington:—
Grand National, three miles: Grosvenor,
1; Telarno, 2; Jollity, 3.
Kensington Steeple, about 21 furlongs:
Mendit, 1; Nyangay, 2.
Iramoo Welter, one mile: Segna, 1; Rug-
byean, 2.
Winter Handicap, one mile and a half:
Valwyne, 1; Cairncross, 2.
* * * *
Horses from Maoriland made their pres-
ence felt at Moorefield (N.S.W.) on Satur-
day ; and three of those that failed lost
no friends. Clarus (Lucullus —Llamberrus)
was favorite at 7 to 2 for the first division
of the Flying Handicap, and had he skipped
out with the bunch —he. Indus and Golden
Grist were badly left —lie would probably
have won. As it was, Prairie Belle (5 to
1) got the best of a fine finish with Biavon,
Pearl Sea (each 20 to 1) and Bongula
“DOING” HER BIT.
(7 to 1), thanks largely to Pike’s horseman-
ship. Le Choucas. who was bred in Aus-
tralia (lie is by Magpie—Ki Ivi), was sent
out at 3 to 1 for the second division, lie
also was poorly served at the start, but it
is doubtfu. whether lie could have beaten
Reference (6 to 1), though he was only a
neck away at the finish; Reference’s rider
had a bit in hand. Judging by the betting,
Breezy (Swift Flight—Gipsy Martian) was
not fancied for the- Kogarah Stakes, which
went to the hitherto unlucky Beelgah (10
to 1), a Magpie mare who shapes like a
stayer; but there was a bit of money at
tens for Breezy’s half-brother and stable-
companion Stormy (Quin . Abbey—Gipsy
Martian), though he had failed at a down-
the-line meeting during the week. Stormy
improved remarkably on that showing, and
finished too well for the Lanius stallion
Garrula (5 to 1), who was being tried at
10 furlongs for the first time; Dion (5 to
1) was a good third and Nan Kourgan (10
to 1) fourth; the time, 2min. 7Jsec., was
relatively the fastest of the day. Lastly, The
Thorn (Absurd —Rose Queen) was backed
for the Hurstville Mile, at 2 to 1 and 6 to
4, as if it were all over, but he had to take
on too many challenges in the course of
the journey, and went under by a length
to the more patiently-ridden Gladshot (5 to
1), Mak Siccar (5 to 1) being a good third.
Gladshot comes from the country, and is
by Valfdo —-True Shot. Though getting up
in years he is still useful.

Weights for the A.J.C. Epsom and Metro-
politan and the two Gups came out at the
beginning of the week. The horses here
named seem to be possibilitfes, so far as can
be judged such a long time ahead:—
Epsom (October 1) : F“uji San (9st.
131 b.), Don Moon (Bst. 81b.), Vaals (Bst.
71b.). Wedding Eve (7st. 131 b.), Vallino
(7st. 121 b.). Land of Leisure (7st. 101 b.),
Cimon <'7st. 101 b.), Bravery (7st. 51b.),
Spaghetti (7st. 41b.), Pigeon Pie lost.
111 b.). The handicapper obviously has a
good opinion of Vaals, who has only s!b.
less than his Doncaster weight, in spite of
his numerous failures in the autumn. That
good opinion may be justified.
Metropolitan (October 3) : Pantheon (9st.
111 b.), Amounis (9st. 31b.), Coin Nut (Bst.
111 b.). Bacchu • (BsK. 81b.), Royal Sun
(Bst.), Tibbie (7st. 131 b.), Bicolor (7st.
121 b.), Luddenham (7st. 101 b.), Beedos and
Sum King (7st. 71b.), Triplex (7st. 51b.),
Rawhetu (7st. 21b.), Octember (7st.). A
risk has been taken with Amounis, who
may develop into a stayer, as Speciality did.
Coin Nut and Bacchus are not well treated,
but both are good horses; and Luddenham
was going very well in the Sydney Cup at
a mile and five furlongs.
Caulfield Cup (October 15) : Commenda-
tion (Bst. 131 b.), Spearer (Bst. 71b.), Star
d’Or (Bst. 51b.), Royal Sun (Bst. 21b.),
Bicolor (7st. 131 b.), Cimon (7st. 91b.), Au
Fait (7st. 81b.), Sum King (7st. 61b.).
If Commendation is as good as Limerick,
as many Maorilanders say, he has been given
a decided chance —in the Epsom he has 9st.
7lb. and in the Metrop. 9st. 51b. Royal
Sun is a rapidly-improving English-bred
horse whom a race like the Caulfield Cup
ought to suit.
Melbourne Cup (November 1) : Pantheon
(9st. 71b.), Limerick (9st. lib.), Commen-
dation and The Banker (9st.), Piastoon
(Bst. 91b.), Bacchus (Bst. 51b.), Coin Nut
(Bst. 21b.), Naos (Bst.), Valwyne (7st.
101 b.), Royal Feast (7st. 81b.), Killara (7st.
71b.), Au Fait (7st. 51b.). Piastoon is
rather well treated with 111 b. more than
in the Sydney Cup, and he is big enough
to carry it. And Pantheon has only 41b.
more than when he ran that great third to
Spearfelt and Naos, who has gone up a
stone. Certainly he is rising seven years,
by Australian reckoning. Killara, the hope
of Adelaide, has a great chance to prove
himself another King Ingoda.
* * * *
“Carpet”: Jack Higgins, chairman of the
A..T.C. stipendiary stewards, lias fluttered a
lot of racing dovecots since his return from
India, and his subsequent appointment at
liandwick headquarters, a few years ago.
After the Easter meetings lie was reported
to have turned in his resignation, which,
it was said, would take effect at the end
of the racing year. What he did, appar-
ently, was to give six months’ notice; his
resignation has been “accepted with regret”
as from October 16. So the wholesale dis-
qualifications in the Songgift affair, which
included the horse, the trainer (S. B. Kelly)
and one of Australia’s finest jockeys in James
Munro—appeals have been lodged in each
case —may not be the indomitable “stipe’s”
swansong. An odd feature of the Songgift
business is the intrusion of the political
element; O’Halloran, M.L.A. for Eastern
Suburbs, butted in with a defence of the
jockey. As the case is sub judice it was
a gross impertinence, but the offender repre-
sents a racing constituency and is tragically
in need of votes.
* * * $
“Bouragi”: Papua is evidently plunging
deeper into the morass of gambling, and I
am wondering what the missionaries are
going to do about it. The Papua Turf (Club
held its second meeting the other day out-
side Port Moresby, and everyone, from the
Lieutenant-Governor to the other end of the
social scale, was represented. There were
some useful prizes too, the Rona Handicap
of £6O being a cut above a lot of the purses
offered by the proprietary “country” racing
clubs that roost, like expectant crows, just
outside the edges of the big Australian
metropolitan areas. T. L. Sefton, who seems
to be the C. B. Kellow of those parts, col-
lected three of the four races, including the
£6O event. The show must have been an
edifying moral lesson for our Papuan brother,
whom the Government fines and jugs for
gambling in any shape, though the one it
mostly takes is an insane form of beggar-
my-neighbor with cards, beside which black-
fellows’ euchre is as highbrow auction bridge.
Footbrawl
A crowd of 56,000 saw the N.S.W. Rugby
League XIII defeat Queensland at Sydney
Cricket Ground on Saturday by 14 points to
10 —two tries four goals to two tries two
goals. Though the standard of the League
game in Sydney has recovered this season,
the Queenslanders were solid favorites, and
they flattered their supporters in the first
half-hour, when, with a brisk breeze behind
them, their big forwards, in spite of numer-
ous penalties, overran the opposing van-
guard, and gave the N.S.W. inside backs
little chance to open up the game. In the
second spell, with the Maroons leading by
10 to 4, N.S.W. took the upper hand. The
Queensland forwards were slowing up, and
though the fortunes of the game fluctuated in
exciting fashion the local men had all the
better of this spell. A try by Wearing and
a penalty by O’Rourke brought N.S.W. to a
point behind their opponents, and Finch, on
the other wing, was all but over twice.
Four minutes from time full-back Righton
kicked a great field goal. Then a passing
rush from the N.S.W. pack resulted in Root
diving over for a try, and it was all over.
The Queenslanders were well beaten for
the ball in the scrums, Justice (St. George)
hooking in great style. In the Red backs,
Gorman was hardly at his top, while Caples,
at full-back, was not up to past northern
performers in this position. The veteran
Craig, once of Balmain and University, made
a good all-round showing, and Hughes, the
new five-eighth, will do better with big-match
experience. The Queenslanders have a find
in King, a pacy, clever winger from Towns-
ville ; his side-stepping of Blair and in-pass
to Leibke, to score his side’s first try, was
attractive football. The star turn of the
N.S.W. side was undoubtedly Kelly’s show-
ing in the forwards. The St. George man
gave an exhibition of clean and vigorous
rucking such as is not often seen in the
League game, while he was as übiquitously
effective in other directions. O’Rourke was
the best of the Blue backs, and Finch . and
Wearing played great football on the wings,
while Blair, badly worried at first by the
Queensland “spoilers,” openecj up some
pretty movements in the second half. An
early match between City and Country teams
was won, 19—10, by City.

CUTTING OUT THE GRACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Rugby Union has agreed to the team which
wil] shortly leave for England being designated ‘The
Waratahs,’ but has stipulated that war cries during
the tour shall be eliminated.”
Play up and play the game, you stalwart
fellows,
Nor take it hard authority compels
You to discard preliminary bellows
And can chaotic yells.
No more shall Cockneys pale at some fierce
slogan
That might conceivably in days of yore
Have rolled from leaping myalls on the
Bogan
Or Maoris out for gore.
No more shall Geordies hear a fearsome
canto
Rise, as the field you enter cap-a-pie,
That might for all they know be Esperanto
Or baffling Cherokee.
Even the Taffies, used to words that splinter
The teeth and chorussed howls that split
the skies,
Will give you welcome just as warm this
winter
Without your battle-cries.
Play up and give old Britain’s best a
dressing-
Down, and your triumphs with acclaim
we’ll greet.
Only eliminate that savage blessing
Before you have your meat.

unusual heights. University’s good team-
work gave the students an easy win over
Western Suburbs, Uni. totting up 26 to 3
in the first spell and ending with 36 to IL.
A. W. Ross, the international full-back,
kicked 6 goals. Randwick went down to
Eastern Suburbs, which scored 14—0. G'ebe-
Balmain’s forwards got a much weakened
side home against North Sydney by 8 to 3,
“Pup” Raymond, the N.S.W., Oxford and
England rep., turning out for G.-B. and
playing a fine game at full-back.

The final Soccer test against the Czecho-
Slavs at Sydney Showground suffered from
the attraction of the Dig League match next
door. A fast game ended in a draw—4 goals
each. Queensland supplied the half-back
line and the centre forward; the rest of the
Australian side were N.S.W. players. Clai’k,
at centre, was a poor substitute for Masters,
of Balgownie, and gave his wings few open-
ings. Leading 3-1 at half-time, the Czechs
faded at the finish. A good and clever side,
displaying fine teamwork, the visitors never
quite accustomed themselves to the pace set
by the Australians, particularly in the New-
castle district and Queensland ; still, with a
win and two draws, they had a shade the
better of the tests —if tests they can be
called.

In the Australian code Newtown checked
the triumphal march of the unbeaten pre-
miers, Eastern Suburbs, the clubs drawing
50-50 —East 6-14 and Newtown 7-8 —after a
fierce game at Erskineville.

The meeting of Carlton and Collingwood
drew a 35,000 crowd to Victoria Park on
Saturday and the game was worth it, being
exceptionally fast, with good system and
flashes of fine kicking and marking. At
lemon-time ’Wood had a 3-point lead, but
after that the Magpies tired while the Blues
stuck grimly to it. At the end Carlton had
95 points to ’Wood’s 83. But for the bril-
liance of Duncan, Carlton’s half-back, many
a Magpie attack w r ould have been rammed
home; the chief initiator of those attacks
was Beveridge, who dominated the centre
line. Hawthorn surprised the Richmond
Tigers, and by close play and fine marking
held them until near the close; then a couple
of forced goals saved the game, but it was a
close call: Richmond, 74 points; Hawthorn,
60. Similarly, Footscray staggered Mel-
bourne ; it was mainly the latter’s knowledge
of tactics and its long experience in tight
fixes that pulled it. through, with 73 points to
’Scray’s 51. The despised Fitzroy Maroons
went down to Geelong and frightened a year's
growth out of the local XVIII; a few fierce
rushes in the closing minutes gave Geelong
the victory, but it was touch-and-go ; Geelong,
87; ’Roy, 80. St. Kilda beat North Melbourne
by 97 points to 88; and Essendon went down
wallop for the eighth consecutive time, South
Melbourne doing the fell deed with 99 points
to ’Don’s 84. _
“Hotham” : “Sonny” Elms, a famous Vic-
torian footballer of the ’eighties and ’nine-
ties, has fallen on evil days, physically and
financially. South Melbourne cricket and
football followers have organised a campaign
to raise at least a thousand pounds for the
gallant old wearer of the red and white,
who was a strict amateur throughout his
half-century’s association with South Mel-
bourne sport; and outside sympathisers will
not be barred. It is high time that the Vic.’
League established a fund to meet such cases.
It is wealthy enough.
* ' * * *
“Drop Kick”: South Aus. footballers are
complaining because their State League does
not permit the carrying of the goal-kicking
contest into the finals, as is done in Perth
and Melbourne. The Wheatfielders feel that
they have in Dayman. Logan and Owens
kickers who could stay with the best in
Westralia or Victoria, given the same num-
ber of chances. Campbell, of East Perth,
held the record for Australia last year with
89 goals in 20 matches—lS in the minor
round and two in the finals. Coventry, of
Collingwood, put up a Victorian record with
83 in the same number of games. Incident-
ally, he promises to outdo those figures this
season..
“Clare” : C. F. Young, of the North Adel-
aide club, will manage the South Aus. team
in the Australian-rules “carnival” at Mel-
bourne in August. Young began as a football
official 27 years ago, and has been 13 years
secretary of North Adelaide. He has had
many trips to Westralia and Victoria, and
was in Sydney with a North Adelaide team
as long ago as 1913. He was also in charge
of the South Aus. side which beat Westralia
at Perth in 1925. the first South Aus. team
to down the Gropers on their own stamping
ground.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The best fight seen at the Sydney Stadium
for many months w 7 as that on Saturday night
between Merv Williams, white Australian
(list. 51b.), and Charlie Long, American
negro (list. 21b.). As usual when an Aus-
tralian is engaged, the attendance was
shamefully meagre, and, also as usual,
“clever” people laid as much as 5 to
1 on the coon. Yet, after the first
round, in which Long’s fury carried him oft
his feet, Williams never gave the colored
ge’mman a look-in. In the second round
he started what became a long series of
terrific right uppercuts with a beauty which
steadied the coon. The third was a hurri-
cane affair from which Charlie emerged with
a cut and bleeding tongue, the effect of
uppercuts. In this and every subsequent
round Long resorted to clinging with the left
and banging heavy rights over the kidney.
This blow has been barred (on paper) by
Stadiums, Ltd., but only once during the
furiously-contested 15 rounds did the
referee expostulate with Long, although
Mcrv’s left loin w r as scarlet, and!, even
bleeding, before the end.
In the sixth round Long’s adroit butt
opened a small cut on Williams’s left eye-
brow, but luckily the blood ran clear of
the eye itself. O’Donnell patched the cut
during the spell and it did not bleed again
till the tenth. Long looked disheartened
after the referee’s reprimand in the seventh.
Two rounds later, in evading a wild swipe,
Williams slipped on the new canvas and
came down heavily on his face. Rising
briskly, he smashed rights to the ear and
jaw, and his rights to the body in the fol-
lowing round were frequent and forceful.
In the eleventh and on to the end the Queens-
lander resorted to straight lefts, many of
which reached the nose; for these Long
had no guard. Full of confidence, the white
man went on increasing his lead, and lie was
cheered for minutes after receiving the ver-
dict. Long fought pluckily and the wonder
is that he was on his feet at the end of
the fifteenth. Like most Australian boxers
of his time, Williams has received little

DRYVER: “Yes, but I wonder what it’s like under the bonnet.”
encouragement from promoters and specta-
tors, but it will be impossible to keep him
out of the big money now-.
* * * *
“Mitt Shover”: Time was in the U.S.A.
when a defeated champion pug passed at
once into black forgetfulness. It is different
now, for the cable tells that Jack Dempsey
has been guaranteeed £50.000 for his scrap
with Jack Sharkey on July 21. Sharkey is
to get a quarter of the receipts—-it is esti-
mated that these will total £200,000 —with-
out any guarantee. Max O’Rell once sized
up the Yanks as “mostly colonels.” They
seem nowadays to be mostly “mugs”. when
the pug-exploiters are getting in their fine
work.
* * * *
Having had a taste of orthodox wrestling,
the Melbourne Stadium crowd was glad to see
Billy Edwards back on the mat last Satur-
day night. It loves his rough work and
gets an added pleasure out of hooting him
for it. The Canadian, who scaled 12st.
1011 b., took the hooting and his share of the
purse—a fat one —with equal composure. His
opponent was Al Ivarasick (12st. 811 b. 1, who
gave his best and most willing display in
this country. When William introduced his
methods of barbarism, the Russian retorted
in kind, and things became so animated that
Bridges had to drag them apart. Al’s head-
locks proved more effective than the Canadi-
an’s, and lie used wristlocks and toeholds
in profusion. For a time, indeed, he was all
over the Canadian, but in the fifth round
he himself fell into a toehold that was very
nearly a winner. In the seventh the Muscovite
clapped on a series of reverse headlocks that
made Edwards reel to the ropes, but, going
in to finish the job, A 1 was met with a raised
knee. It caught him on the stummick, and
Edwards, recovering magically, pounced on
him and was on the point of putting him
down on both shoulders when Karasick sur-
rendered. It was the only fall of the match,
and Edwards was crowned. The populace
howled at the knee artist and cheered the
unfortunate Russian —in fact, it went away
quite happy.
“Stellsby” : When 3LO switched over to the
Melbourne Stadium to broadcast a descrip-
tion of the Thye-Yokel wrestling match (B.
23/6/’27), the boxing preliminaries were
still in progress and observer McCance
whiled away the time giving a description of
the bouts. Listeners derived more amuse-
ment from the comments of the spectators.
One gentleman, whose beerily plaintive voice
tvas wafted to Broome and Cairns, appealed
to the referee to show him something more
thrilling. “W’y don’cher put on a pair of
performin’ birds?” he asked. McCance guf-
fawed into the microphone, and shut down
until the wrestlers appeared.
Racquet and Bawl
Sixteen-year-old Betty Nuthall is the lead-
ing attraction at Wimbledon this year; she
lias taken the limelight from even the mighty
Tilden. To the delight of a nation which
has grown accustomed to seeing its best
players beaten year after year, the girl
defeated, among others, Mrs. Mallory, of
American celebrity, Mrs. Hill, the English
covered-courts champion, and Fraulein Aus-
sem, the “German Suzanne.” The speed
and accuracy of her cross-court and line-
driving are described as excelling anything
seen from the Lenglen, but that may be
pardonable exaggeration. Among the men,
the Americans and Gauls took six of the last
eight places, others to qualify being Kozeluh,
the Czech, and Timmer, of Holland. Con-
don. the South African, went down to
Lacoste. while Borotra. Kozeluh and Tim-
mer accounted for the remaining Britons.
Tilden gave a masterly display in beating
Brugnon 6-3. 6-1. 3-6, 7-5. He took
his shoes off in the fourth set to gain a
better footing, and. hitting with tremendous
force, wore down his scarcely less brilliant
opponent.
“Linesman”: Betty Nutliall started her
tennis as a small kid at Ivingston-on-Thames,
where her papa was a caterer. Despite all the
cabled talk of Betty’s precision and dash as
a volleyer. she is, like all female stars, a
baseline artist. The only Tilden wins all his
battles from the same position, and Betty is
well content to pursue the safer and less
spectacular game, relying on the drive off
both hands for all her winning points.
Women are physically and mentally unfitted
for net-rushing tactics in singles. It needs an
alert mind and a magnificent pair of feet to
sail in for the anticipatory game, and even
Lenglen at her best never did this. Helen
Wills also smacks everythine from the back
of the court.
Jj: Hi sfc
Jack Crawford and Harry Hopman put
up a surprising performance in the inter-
district tennis matches at Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday. Playing for Western
Suburb? against Sydney I. the youngsters
flattened out the N.S.W. title-holders, A. L.
North and N. Peach. 6-1, 6-1, giving a great
display of all-round tennis. They also dis-
posed of R. 0. Cummings and J. McCaus-
land, 6-0, 6-1, winning, in all, 4 sets 24
games to 3 games against good opposition.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Colonel B.”: It is surely time we had
all-Australian golf clubs in the shops. I
have tried several irons the heads of which
were drop-forged in Melbourne, and as far
as 1 could see the heads were as good as the
best hand-forged Scotch club-heads. The
shafts of these clubs were American hickory.
A pattern-maker I know has what I believe
to be the only set of all-Australian clubs.
The driver head was cut from a tough piece
of mulberry; the brassy head is of apricot
wood, and the shafts were split from selected
pieces of mountain-ash grown near Mt.
Kosciusko. The heads of the irons were
forged from Hoskins’s bayonet steel. My
friend states that the clubs have given him
every satisfaction, except that the heads of
the irons show a tendency to work loose in
the summer.
* * * *
“Snowy”: Qualifying rounds for cham-
pionships have become too crowded. At least
half of the 90-odd players who stepped out
at Rose Bay (N.S.W.) recently could only
have qualified if the age of miracles returned.
Such aspirants clutter up the fairways to
the detriment of those who really have a
chance. As partners are drawn by lot it
sometimes happens that one of these dead-
weights is paired with a man who can really
play, with the invariable result that the
good man cannot do himself justice. One
competitor this year took 100 blows to com-
plete the course; result, his partner, a Maori-
lander who should, on previous performances,
have walked in with strokes to spare, was
numbered among the also ran. That was
the most glaring instance, and there were
others.
* * * *
“Brassy”: The horrible seriousness with
which some people take what they call their
pastimes is shown in a story about a golfer
which has been engaging the attention of
Sydney scribes. The gentleman, it appears,
gives his caddy a special retainer to repeat
at each stroke “Keep your head down.” This
does not apply, of course, on the putting-
green, since the wastage in massacred caddies
would be irreparable. With 75 players out
of a hundred it would do no harm to add
the advice “Keep your eyes shut.” That is
a golden rule for recovering lost confidence
in one’s wooden club shots —once the address
has been made, of course —and one much in
favor with old-time coaches. The writer,
having been much exposed of late to the
average club golfer, is of the opinion that a
general observance of the rule, in any or all
circumstances, would bring about results as
satisfactory as any obtained with the eyes
wide open.
* * * *
“Ploughman”: As to those hole-in-one com-
plications (B. 9/6/’27), Queensland has sup-
plied a case which has flummoxed the rule
and tradition experts. Mrs. R. H. Tanner,
playing on a Brisbane course, took the
fourth in one. Had a man done it, the rest
would have been simple; but there is a cer-
tain delicacy in insisting that a lady should
set ’em up for the crowd. The only way out
of a trying situation was to present the
fair record-maker with a trophy, and this.
is being done.
* * * #
“Mid-Iron”: There have been some inter-
esting revelations in England as to the
extent of gambling on golf. The thing is
rampant in many clubs, especially the expen-
sive ones near London. Recently there was
£3OOO hanging to a private match at one
of these clubs, and at many others it is
hard to get a game without anything from
a fiver to a pound on the result. Still, the
craze will probably die. Sixty or seventy
years ago. cricket matches were still being
played for stakes up to a thousand pounds
a side. “Vere is dot puntin’ now?”
i\i * * *
“Hecli. Sirs”: The usual Scotsman has
turned up as winner of the American open
championship—Tom Armour, a pro., who
abandoned his native links for the more
lucrative lies of the United States. News-
papers describe him as the world’s greatest
player with the long irons, and relate how
he won the midwinter championship in 22
strokes under fours. With a brither Scot,
Oruickshank, Tom recently beat Walter
Hagen and Jock Hutchinson, a great pair.
The continuous success of Scottish golfers in
America, and their increasing numbers, is
the strongest possible proof of the failure
of prohibition.
* * * *
“Minus-plus”: Legh Winser, the South
Aus. amateur champion, has augmented a
good record by winning the Royal Adelaide
club championship for the sixth time in suc-
cession. Winser can claim an unusual
double for a golfer, for he kept wicket for
the South Aus. XI several seasons ago. And
lie has made public appearances as a polo
player.

“Queenslander”: Doubts about Frank
Pearce’s motor-cycle records (B. 16/6/’27)
may now be set at rest. On June 16 Pearce
put up new world’s figures in two cases on
the grass at Deagon (Q.) racecourse. On
a 2|-h.p. Harley Davidson' he covered 5 miles
in 4min. 8 2-ssec., obliterating Tom O’Dea’s
grass-track record (4min. 39sec.) for this
class of machine; his average speed was
1 2.464 m.p.li.—hair-raising for a small-
powered cycle. On a 7-9-h.p. H.D. Pearce
then went after Spencer Stratton’s 5-mile
figures of 3min. 58sec. for machines under
1000 c.c. A bad skid spoilt the first attempt,
but he did the trick at the second try in
3min. 56sec.; average speed, 76.27 m.p.h. In
each case there was electric timing. The
young Bananalander has been riding only a
little over two years.
“Garry”: liadfields, the steel founders,
whose works at Alexandria, Sydney, are
turning out a lot of material for the Harbor
Bridge, have bought the Bean motor busi-
ness. This is one of the few English con-
cerns that have been intelligently reaching
after “colonial” trade. Birtles is at present
driving a Bean from London to Sydney, on
a route that doesn’t include a great deal of
sea, to demonstrate that the car is well up
to pioneering stunts. Another evidence of
Bean concern for Australia is the produc-
tion, under the Hadfield wing, of a 30-cwt.
commercial truck, especially designed for
Australian service.
“Migrant” : The English motor trade is
up against the problem of the used car. In
nine out of ten sales there has to be an
allowance for the old ’bus, and traders are
tired of outbidding each other on that end
of the deal. So the trade associations have
got together, made a list of all cars and old
models, and fixed a fair average price for
every item on the list. It doesn’t matter
whether you’ve run your Rolls-Royce Phan-
tom or Prince Henry Vauxhall off its legs
or kept it in a glass case, so far as the
theory goes. But what can’t be done at the
front door can be done at the back.
* * * *
“Tappet” : Here are the figures, made up
to the end of last year, showing the car
and motor-cycle registrations in relation to
population of various countries: U.S., 1 to
5 persons; Maoriland and Canada. 1 to 12;
Australia, 1 to 19; Britain, 1 to 4S; France,
1 to 51; Germany, 1 to 247 ; Italy. 1 to 367.
“Binei” : F'ew of those who remember the
Papua of a generation ago would have betted
heavily on the development of the motor
trade in that upended country. Yet a trav-
eller interested in the petrol trade has been
JIMMY MUNRO, one of Australia’s
leading jockeys, who has been disquali-
fied for 12 months by the A.J.C.
stipendiary stewards over the running
of Songgift at Canterbury Park. He
is appealing.
telling Sydney newspapers that thr lumber
of motor vehicles ir those benighted parts
is surprising. There is only one real road
in Papua, that from Port Moresby to the
Ilona Falls in the hills; it is 20 miles or
so in length, and is as much utilised by
motorists as is the only decent road in
N.S.W.—if there is one. Motor-tractors and
lorries are also in evidence on the planta-
tions. and since these are mostly clustered
within c-00-eo of “Port,” the latter is the
leading _ motor metropolis of the Territory.
Samarai is also mentioned in this connection,
though how a car has room to move on that
-50-acre islet it is hard to imagine. The
writer can recall a sports meeting held there
when the stewards had to wait till the tide
went down before there was room on the
wet sand beach for a 100yds. dash.
Miscellaneous
“Coot” : The Vic. Cricket Association has
distributed dividends of £l7O among district
and £B5 among subdistrict clubs, increases, of
£7O and £35 on last year’s divs. In addition
each of the district clubs received £97 from
the receipts of the final and semi-final games.
The association’s building in Flinders-street
has been a great financial success; before
long it will be clear of debt.
“Shrewsbury”: Backyard chat between
the N.S.W. Cricket Association and the
Board of Control still goes on at intervals.
Recently the State body acidly asked whether
the Board was doing anything in the matter
of the suggested visit of an Indian XI next
season, and added that if the Board felt
tired it would take on the job itself. The
Board has replied, in the manner of a fat
man speaking into a half-empty pintpot, that
it is looking into the matter, also that the
projected tour is entirely Board business,
and one that any dashed State would do well
to keep its sticky beak out of. The N.S.W.
body, apart from breathing heavily through
its nose, has, as yet, made no reply.
* *. *
“Bad Australian” : The boys were chatting
round the galley fire and the conversation
turned to cricket. “My countlee playem
clicket,” said Ding Bat the cook. “Wotcher
think o' thatV” said Jimmy the Larrikin. “I
alwiz thort the Pongs wouldn’t come at enny-
tliinK but fan-tan an’ pakkerpoo.” “Oh
yesli.” Ding replied ; “fan-tan, pak-a-pu, welly
good—clicket numbali wun, mo’ bettah.”
“Well, howdjer play yer Chow game, Ding?"
demanded the Larrikin. “Playem all li'.
Lallikin,” Ding explained ; “catchem wun,
two clicket, inittem longa clockcly basin.
Him fight dam’ quick. You bet ha’p-pinny,
ha’p-clown, ha’p-sobbelin ; all li’. Clicket fight-
em two, tlee minute. Bimeby my clicket

wun pong. By eli, Lallikin, my countlee
alia time playem clicket.”
“Centurion”: When the footballers from
the Maoriland Universities were in Sydney
they were so struck with the gathering of
’Varsity crews from the six States of Aus-
tralia on the Nepean that some of them
resolved to put in hand the formation of
University rowing clubs on their return.
Maoriland Universities do not bulk large in
respect of the numbers of undergrads, attend-
ing them; still, when such secondary schools
as Wanganui and others can make a feature
of rowing, the Universities, especially Auck-
land and Christchurch, should be able to do
their bit. The Australian Universities’ race
for the Oxford and Cambridge Cup is rowed
in every Australian State in turn. The
inclusion of Maoriland would add greatly to
the interest already taken in the event.
“Slide” : The N.S.W. Rowing Association
has turned down the suggestion of the Aus-
tralian Rowing Council for a sculling test
on the Yarra in October. The council's
idea was that such a race, with Cecil Mc-
Villy of Tasmania, great sculler of other
days, as selector, would be the best method
of choosing a sculler to represent Australia
at the Olympiad next year. The N.S.W.
body considers that its own representative,
R. Pearce, should be selected without further
test. Possibly Pearce is the best sculler in
sight, but at Hobart he met Tasmanian and
Victorian representatives only. Who is to
say that Queensland, which has produced
such fine scullers as Mick Slack and Baynes,
or South Aus. or Westralia doesn’t hold
someone capable of lowering his colors?
Certainly not the N.S.W.R.A. Its man may
be as good as it thinks, and probably is, but
it is the Australian Council’s business to
decide that.
“Swivel” : Major Goodsell was always will-
ing, when in his native Australia, to take on
any challenger for the title. Since he has
been domiciled in America he seems to have
acquired the habit of hanging on to the
lucrative label till the last possible minute.
Young Barry, of England, has been after
Goodsell's seal]) for some time, but Major
(who is not a major) has been dodging a
definite acceptance. Then he declined to con-
sider a challenge from Maorilander Hannan.
Now Burns, another Australian, has paid
the necessary deposit on this side and
demands to know Goodsell's intentions. That
gentleman seems to be coyly hovering between
Burns and Barry, for beyond stating that he
wants the race, when it is fixed up, to be
rowed at Oakland, California, he has declined
to commit himself.

“Hayband” : At Rooty Hill (N.S.W.) last
week Carter Bros.’ Terminus added to his
remarkable record in coursing classics. In
four seasons in N.S.W. and Vic. this speed-
model has won four Waterloo Cups (two in
each State), and only once has he been led
to the hare; that was when Buckley’s Bril-
liantshine showed the way in the deciding-
course for the 1924 Dewar Cup. Terminus
fought out the final with Buckley’s champion
puppy, Big Booty. The contest w r as any-
body’s till they were within striking distance
of a fast hare; then the puppy tired, and
his stouter opponent wheeled puss a bare
length ahead. “A half-point,” said the judge,
and that modest margin put £lOOO in the
Carter pockets. Incidentally, Buckley was
in second position last year, when Punty
failed to match Terminus’s all-conquering
drive. Andy was the unlucky dog of the
stake. He led his opponent (Flying Foot-
R. KING, a speedy and clever wing three-
quarter from Townsville (N.Q.), who
played his first inter-Stqte match at
Sydney on Saturday.
steps) in a semi-final by the length of a ship.
But the hare didn’t know the way home, and
heavily-run Andy was outworked. It was his
fourth outing in two months.
“ ’Gabba”: An outbreak of greyhound-
racing threatens to occur in Queensland,
where the trustees of the Brisbane Cricket
Ground on the “south side” are asking leave
of the authorities to lease it for the purposes
of Australia’s latest gambling craze. The
B.C.G. was originally intended to rival the
Sydney C.G. The writer was one of 300 opti-
mists who sparred up a life-member’s fee each
to start work on the new proposition in the
1890’s. Though a fair amount of big and
little cricket has been played on the arena,
it has for years been the stamping ground
of such uplifting sports as pony-racing and
professional running. Like the Sydney
ground, it was originally intended for amateur
sport only, but it seems to have strayed even
further from rectitude in that respect than
its Sydney sister.
“Blade Sight” : The X.S.W. Rifle Associa-
tion’s annual meet at Anzac Range. Golds-
worthy. in October will be the biggest thing
of its kind yet staged, after Bisley. Prize
money will amount to £6500. The principal
event will be the Commonwealth match, won
at Melbourne last year by Victoria ; Maori-
land is competing for the first time since
1920. The King’s, w r ith a first prize of £lOO,
as against £6O last year, wall be another star
attraction, while rifle clubs, freelance
shooters and trainees are liberally provided
for.
“Amateur Urger” : Being; in Rockhampton
(Q.). Melba gave some of the heads the
office that she wanted to see a goat-race, and
put up three guineas—none of your quids—
for a prize, \vhen Rocky goat-racing circles
had found out what a guinea is—most of
’em are more used to racing for the odd
three boh than the other sixty—the biggest
entry in local history lined up outside the
Diva’s hotel. This being on the big esplan-
ade along the river front, the police hopped
in and forbade the banns. When the crowd
had gone, and Melba had come from behind
her handkerchief, it was suggested that she
should hand the three guineas to the local
agricultural society, which specialises in
goat-races, flower-show’s and things of that
sort. This was done, and I expect to hear
any day of the Dame singing “Home, Sweet
Home” to the nippers, after decorating Boro-
nia Billy (or something like that) with the
blue ribbon of the Melba Goat Derby.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Trumpeter’: There’s money in fish and
chips. A few years ago a man landed in
Port Adelaide with his discharge from a
steamer and a few pounds. He risked the
few pounds in a humble fish-and-chips enter-
prise. The other day he bought a valuable
block of buildings in Adelaide.
"F.S.” : Some firms have surprisingly short
memories. Two or three in Melbourne,
whose patriotism during the war was famous,
have recently achieved some small economies
by putting off limbless soldiers as lift atten-
dants and placing girls in their places. The
winged soldiers cost £4 10s. and the flappers
£2 10s.
“Churn” : Cow-cockies on the Ma State's
South Coast are realising that the day of
the tiny co-op. concern is done. A central
dairy factory has been erected at Merim-
bula, the port, and a number of little district
factories have closed down. Management
and working expenses have been cut in
halves, and the butter gets to the city quicker
and in better condition.
"Devonport” : Some Tassie sawmillers have
asked the Government for the right to work-
-150, 000 acres of West Coast timber country,
south of the Arthur River, for 99 years.
They undertake to plant as well as cut, and
to erect sizing machinery and a seasoning
plant. There’s to be a nominal capital of
half a million, the promoters taking up
115,000 fully-paid-up £1 shares and receiving
a like amount for their mills, leases and
tramlines, which will be thrown into the
pool.
* * * *
"To Hipi” : “Nikko” (B. 12/5/'27) is
right. Maoriland-grown tobacco can command
a home market. An Auckland firm puts up
good mixtures for both pipe and cigarette.
The flavor is slightly dift'ex-ent from that of
the Virginia article, so the stuff takes a little
while to get used to, but that doesn’t matter,
as S’African experience shows. Magaliesburg
leaf has an even more distinctive flavor, and
burns about three times as fast as Virginian,
but the Yankee-grown stuff can’t stand up
against it in the Union.
“Gregor” : It’s about time Australia hopped
into the aniline dye business. At present only
a email proportion of coal-tar is treated for
its by-products and only the cruder kind of
these are extracted. The rest goes to waste.
Australia imports some millions’ worth of
drugs and dyes derived from coal-tar, though
enough raw material is available to supply
the lot and have a margin over for export.
The U.S.A., since the Big War, has built
up a big coal-tar dye industry—behind a
tariff wall, of course. The tip to Australia
is plain enough.
V Jf. :«c
“Huftin Guffin”: All this talk about over-
production of dried fruits makes me tired.
When I buy some currant buns and find
about one currant to the cubic inch of bun
I wonder if Mildura is only a dream. Yet
I know it is not a dream. I was there some
months ago when the fruit crop gave promise
of being a record. A Mildura man then told
me that if the grower could get 3-Jd. per lb.
he would do very well. Fourpence would be
affluence. Yet Mildura dried fruits cost us
Is. to Is. 2d. per lb. only 250 miles from the
orchards. It is the leakage between the pro-
ducer and consumer that needs plugging up.
“F.J.E.”: Another of the Queensland
Labor Government’s dreams of a successful
State enterprise vanished when it sold the
interest in the Yampi Sound (W.A.) leases
it acquired from Jock Thomson, a former
Westralian M.L.A. The leases were to have
furnished iron ore for works to be established
at Bowen, but McCormack shied at the
prospect of adding another white elephant
to Queensland’s menagerie. So the Govern-
ment turned over its rights to Hoskins, of
Lithgow, for £33,000, the price that was paid
for them, and the Hoskins Co. is certainly in
a position to do more with them than Queens-
land Labor could have done.
“S. Gumm” : Australia bought £37,234,000
worth of U.S. goods last year, and the
Americans took £9.953,000 worth of Aus-
tralian goods, exclusive of £3.000,000 in gold
specie, which was presumably on account
of interest and purchases. The balance was
really heavier against this country, for the
30,394,000 feet of cinema film imported was
valued at a mere £220.703 (less than 2d.
a foot). or only a fifth or sixth part of
what it would realise. The imports from
America included £1,599,000 worth of boots
and shoes, £2,135,000 worth of apparel, tex-
tiles. etc. (there was even £12,705 for
blankets), and £2,535.000 worth of tobacco
and foodstuffs of vegetable origin. There
is hardly an item in these classes, and others,
that would have to be imported if Aus-
tralians took advantage of their opportunities
and gave preference to the first-class produce
of their own Commonwealth.

When the G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven
dropped into Graythwaite one crisp morning
last week everyone was delighted to see
them except the parrots. To each of the
40 war-stricken lads his Ex. had some-
thing to say which brought smiles and laugh-
ter to suffering-worn faces; what do you
think he talked about? Mostly races and
sport! Lady Stonehaven did the rounds of
the wards in the brightest little green straw
hat that seemed to shout “Spring is coming.”
Of course she also wore a coat —black satin,
collared, cuffed and edged in soft, mink fur.
Her Ex. tripped into the kitchen, opened
the oven door, and nearly bumped his Ex.
as lie hopped out from an inspection of the
pantry. Both fell in love with the old gar-
den and the beautiful outlook, but they
seemed most intrigued with the soldiers’
pet birds. The little canaries responded to
her Ex.’s cooings of admiration with trills
and roulades* but the parrots were obstinate
Bolshies. They fluffed out their feathers and
sulked, and the usually most loquacious
cockatoo cocked his eye at the lady’s sweet
blandishments and gave a grunt which might
have been interpreted, “You might get a
shock if I did air my vocabulary.” The
guardian angel of Graythwaite, Mrs. Cecil
Hordern, and Matron Horswill led the vice-
regal tour.
Lady de Chair, back from a country tour,
was at Friedman’s Saturday concert, but
no one got a chance of seeing her gowning—
she wrapped her gold and black coat more
firmly round her as the evening advanced,
and snuggled deeper into her fox shoulder-
wrap. Elaine enjoyed the music from the
fortification of a natural musquash coat
with a skunk collar. Mrs. Walter Swinson’s
cherry velvet wrap was as warming to the
eye as Friedman’s music seemed to be to her
soul. The gent-attendants of the vice-regal
party shivered through the first number and
then covered their sartorial perfection with
thick tweed coats buttoned to the neck. The
Board of Health ought to make it compul-
sory for the civic fathers to provide curtains
to shut off the icy blasts that creep between
and beneath the doors.
Lady _ de Chair was at the ball of the
University Women’s Settlement Committee
at the Ambassadors on Monday night. Her
old-rose and gold gown made a pretty pic-
ture next to fair Elaine’s bright jade and
gold lace frocking. Eleven debs, dropped
their curtseys under the smiling approval
of learned professors, Professor MacCallum’s
lady, Mrs. Peden and Mrs. Muscio.
Rudyard Kipling knew human nature
when he wrote his “Recessional.” Only
such a few seem to remember that boys they
sent away to war with cheers and music
returned pitiful wrecks who could never get
back into ordinary employment again. The
Red Cross had these men taught handicrafts,
and they can turn out pottery, leather-work,
basketry, toys and all kinds of attractive
articles ideal for gifts on all occasions ; yet
they have to beg a market. To sharpen up
public interest the Red Cross Handicrafts
opened a little shop in Angel-place last
week. Russell Sinclair officially opened it,
and asked a forgetful public to reflect that,
apart from the profit the men might make
from their work, the occupation was a vast
relief from the monotony of hospital and the
tedium of suffering. But, alack! his audi-
ence consisted mainly of the stalwarts of the
Red Cross. Such splendid work, too —it
should not have to beg a buyer. If any of
you are needing charming and unusual and
really cheap gifts, slip down into the lane
between the Bank of Australasia and the
National Bank, and you will be surprised at
the variety and excellent quality and origi
nality of the stock.
What a wonderful meaning there is in
that word International! One got a hint of
it at the International Cabaret at the Went-
worth last week. Tne younger set arranged
the frivol to get funds for the forthcoming
International ball, and when the charming
representatives from Sydney’s foreign com-
munities decorated the steps of the palm
court to welcome Beppie de Vries with frag-
rant sweet peas and violets, the canaries in
their gilded cages approved the beautiful
sight with bursts of song. Henriette Segaert
allied Belgium’s force to the French and
Lebanon stall, presided over by the youthful
wife of the French Consul-General, who re-
warded every purchaser of a posy by pin-
ning it in with a beaming smile —the cour-
teous little action immediately brought a
brisk demand for buttonholes. Miss Aboud,
Ade Scarf and Queenie Betar looked after
the Lebanon section. Germany was next
door to France; there Lotta Schneider and
Hanna Tadsen, in the quaintest peasants’
costume, did a thriving trade in novelties.
China showed entrancing goods but more
entrancing maids to sell them, with Essie,
Dulcie, Greta and Vera Quoy and Olga Towl
dressed in the gay silks and embroideries of
their forefathers’ land. These clever little
Chinese girls also arranged a graceful East-
ern dance, while a charming Grecian, Miss
Atsipapa, in flowing draperies, arranged a
folk-dance which suggested that the glory of
Greece has not all departed. Dorothy Lyne,
a former _ Federal Minister's youngest bud,
and Cassie Ford arranged a wattle-tree in
Australia’s stand and had the honor of enter-
taining Mme. Pompadour at tea.
Mrs. Spencer Watts has inherited some
of the business acumen of her clever mother.
Besides a professionally-audited balance-sheet
she handed a cheque for £722 to the Ivari-
tane Mothercraft Centre, with the intimation
that the Government subsidy would double
the amount. The wad was the result of
the Karitane Ball at the Wentworth a couple
of weeks ago; the fact that Mrs. Watts
organised and managed it and did the col-
lecting herself probably accounts for the
promptness in winding up. Of course Mrs.
Maclurcan gave the dinner and the music,
so she had a strong push-off.
The new military Commandant of Tas-
mania, Colonel Cox-Taylor, takes over his
new job in September, following General
Jess, who goes to Westralia. The colonel
has spent most of his life in Sydney; in the
days of Lord Jersey he was one of Govern-
ment House’s extra aides.
Betty Wilson, only daughter of David
Wilson, of Yandooya, Rose Bay, is announc-
ing, with a diamond sparklet, that she will
share S. M. Herald dividends in the near
future as the bride of Warwick Fairfax,
only son of J. 0., the knighted grandson of
John, the founder of the family fortunes.
Cecilia, second daughter of the peppery
little man whom Hobart, Perth and Sydney
knew as Governor Strickland, is engaged to
Hubert de Trafford, a captain in the British
army, Cecilia is remembered in Australia
as a nice, quiet girl who helped with the
entertaining -when her mother (who died in
1918) was too ill. One of her paternal
ancestors bore the banner of St. George at
Agincourt. Perhaps ade Trafford was there,
too —the family is old enough.
Shore Grammar chapel saw another of its
old boys through on Saturday night, when
Dr. Wilson, son of William Wilson, of
Greenwich, married Eileen Foote, of Bris-
bane. Sisters Lorna and Muriel attended
the lace-frocked bride. Lieut. Gordon Wil-
son. R.A.N., and Dr. Victor Best were
groomsmen. The party was held at the’*
Wentworth.

the other day;
and herewith
is a little pic-
ture of the
charming lady
who shared
the congratu-
lations with him.
Howard Saxby, who used to be president
of the Undergrads’ Association, won a favor
from Gwendolyn Aubrey at St. Stephen’s
last Thursday night. The bride was an
ethereal vision of satin, lace and tulle, with
the merest blush of pink in her bouquet.
Her sister Nance, Eleonora Bosgard and
Dr. Jean Healy enhanced the wedding dis-
play in shell-pink taffetas frocks with bright
blue velvet ribbons streaming from their
shoulders. Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey gave the
wedding supper at their home, Burrougli
House, Darlinghurst.
Madeline Munro, of Cremorne, arranged
her tulle veil like a soft fan over her dark
head, so that it fell in misty cascades about a
cloth of silver robe with a termination of dia-
ment-encrusted tulle, when she dressed for
the marriage ceremony with John Fisher,
of Mosman, at St. Mary’s Cathedral on
Thursday night. The golden-clad brides-
maids were Eily, Molly and Belle Fisher
and Mavis Armstrong. The healths were
drunk at the Wentworth.
John Drayton’s only son, John, who is
following in father’s inky footsteps, took
to himself a wife at St. Mary’s Cathedral
recently. The little bride, Moya Craner,
blushed in faintest pink georgette and white
tulle. Her sister Muriel ’maided her in
powder-blue taffetas and a black picture-hat.
Looking like a daughter of the Vikings
in her crystal-encrusted frock, silver gleam-
ing train and cloudy tulle veilings, Helga
Halberg became Mrs. Keith Spanswick in
the Shore Grammar chapel, the Alma Mater
of her bridegroom. Her sister Edna and
his sister Muriel and Tuppie Doolan, frocked
in turquoise and gold, were the attendant
maids. The wedding-feast was at the Hal-
berg home at Wollstonecraft.
Sydney’s good citizen Kelso King finished
his 50th year with the Mercantile Mutual
Insurance office the other day; and all
hands c o m-
bined to give
him a Long-
staff painting
o f himself—
alongside is a
little reproduc-
tion of part of
it. There were
days when Mr.
King was
known chiefly
as (1) a sort
of advisory
shadow of
Walter Rus-
sell Hall and
(2) one of the
very few men
in Sydney who
habitually wore
silk hats. But
as the years
wore on Kelso
King, having
a little more leisure perhaps, disclosed him-
self as a man of very large human sympa-
thies ; and the number of good works to
be credited to him and his wife and his
daughter Olive would take a big tablet to
record.
The recent sale of Ililder pictures at
Farmer’s realised £2581. The unsolds have
been returned to the bank, and the blue-eyed
widow T has taken the few personal not-for-
sales back to her home.
Agnes Goodsir is back again for her show
at the Macquarie Galleries with part of her-
self in a sling. After 20 years’ absence her
native city gave her a warm welcome artis-
tically, but a cruel one physically—she broke
her arm through falling when alighting from
a train in Malvern. The artist did not recog-
nise her Melbourne, where she spent many
hours in the National Art Gallery, yet she
does not think the contents of that expensive
place are half as well chosen as those in the
’ Domain treasure-house. By the way, Agnes
Goodsir and Bessie Davidson (S.A.) share
the distinction of being the only Australian
women to have the title of Socibtaire des
Beaux Arts, an honor which entitles them
to send five pictures of their own choice each
year to the Paris Salon. Mrs. Hilda Rix
Nicholas is an associate des Beaux Arts,
which entitles her to send three.
Agnes Goodsir was given a tea party at
the Royal Sydney Golf Club on Saturday
afternoon to meet the elect. The hostesses
were the three Milne girls.
In the mess-room of old Victoria Barracks
on Friday evening Staff Corps officers gave
a hop under garlands of roses and chrysan-
themums and pink-tinted lights. Colonel
Lorenzo brought his lady and two daughters;
others on the roll were Major Locke and
wife, Colonel MoColl and his tall lady, Mc-
Kenzies, Campbells. Robertsons, Major John
Chapman (son of the late Austin) and
handsome Mrs. John and a host of subs. —-
amongst them Lieutenant Chalmers, who
saw to the ultimate oyster patty, and Lieu-
tenant Thompson, sec. of the committee.
The Independent Order of Oddfellow’s has
a pretty way of doing things when there is
a pretty incentive. It had 25 debs, at its
annual ball at the Australia Hall on Friday
night; gallant Oddfellows in full regalia held
arches of fragrant flowers for the young
ladies to walk beneath to be introduced to
the Mayoress by the wife of Grand Master
Newton.
A delightful dance was given by students
of the Women’s College at the Louisa Mac-
donald Commemoration Hall on Friday
night. Beneath royal blue and white
streamers principal Susie Williams beamed
approval in black jetted draperies, and her
smiles were rewarded with a bouquet of
pink roses. Senior-student Edna Mackenzie
helped to receive the guests, including repre-
sentatives of all the other colleges.
Croydon P.L.C. Old Girls had a good time
at the Ambassadors on Friday night, where
they garlanded the stairways and covered up
the ivory and gold with red flowers and red
and white ribbons, and flow the red and
white device of the college. The frivol is
an annual affair, arranged for profit, the
spoil maintaining a cot in the Children’s
Hospital. Miss Allen, superintendent of the
college, was the honored guest of president
Mrs. J. R. Hooton.
The Wentworth witnessed the annual jazz
of St. Catherine’s —the original Clergy
Daughters’ school —a particularly joyous revel
this year. Matrons were as prominent as
maids among the ex-students. Miss Lenthall.
principal, was chief hostess.
Sydney Grammar, although an academy
for the embryo man, does not disdain fem-
inine help. The recently-formed ladies’ asso-
ciation gave its first dance in the big school
hall on Saturday night. Radiators helped
a little, but the patrons had to dance ener-
getically to keep off the freeze.
The North Sydney Rowing Club tripped
its annual measure at the Ambassadors,
bringing the club pennant and house flag
to brighten up the palm court. Vice-Captain
J. A. Littlewood had a ladies’ committee to
share the organising arrangements; Mrs.
H. S. Aylwin was president and Mrs. A. J.
Ellis lion, secretary.
When Kirribilli Y.W.C.A. Hostel’s ten-
nis devotees decided to hold a dance, the
enterprising little secretary sent a bundle
of tickets to the Y.M.C.A.. They were
returned with the notification that the
Y.M.C.A. did not encourage dancing. Never-
theless. the young Christian girls chanced it
last Friday night in the new Y.W.C.A. llall,
which seems to have been planned specially
for dancing, with its beautifully-polished
parquet floor. They had a joyous time and
(shocking as it may be) whips of partners.
St. Ignatius College chose its colors as
happily as its Old Boys chose the date
of their annual ball at the Wentworth, for
it enabled them to pay a pretty courtesy to
their feminine guests. Each one was pre-
sented with a Avristlet of white hyacinths
and violets tied with blue and white ribbons.
Most of the tables were displaying the col-
lege colors in the same fragrant flowers.
President A. W. d’Apice and his wife, in
pink georgette and crystal, entertained at
their table representatives from all the Great
Public Schools.
Domremy ex-students had their annual
ball at the Ambassadors, where eight of
the very newest ex-students announced their
arrival into the social whirl by dropping a
curtsey to Mark Sheldon’s lady, who smiled
approval in black velvet secured with buckles
of diamente and jet. President Mrs. 11. L
Taylor presented the girls ; they brought to
mind a freshly-iced cake, the half of them
in white and the other half in pink, with
pink and white posies, and pink and white
tulle bows tied demurely under their round
chins. They were Eileen Aiken, Marie
Nicholls, Patricia Sheils, Annie Ferney.
Vonnie Cain, Jean Sutherland and Millie
Webb, the last the luckiest, for she won
the silver gift, a reward for holding the
lucky number among the silver balloons
which the debs, received.
Waverley Christian Brothers’ College did
not find the Palais Royal too big. They flew
their colors, blue and gold, in flags, ribbons
and flowers. Mrs. Arthur McNiven intro-
duced the debs, to the Mayoress, who looked
like a nice summer dessert in apricot and
crystals. The silver- and white-clad 16,
holding the insignia bouquets of the freshly-
arrived, were Lily Dunn, Olive Hudson.
Kathleen McDonnell, Elsie Miller, Julie
Furlong. Angie Hill, Monica McKeon, Renie
Carey, Lai Osborne, Connie Horne, Mary
McGrath, Doris Veney, Patricia Mofifatt.
Kathleen Heydon, Millie and Bessie Hart.
Coogee Life Savers held their I.4th annual
hop at the Wentworth last week, when the
Venuses of the surf showed that they could
look just as fascinating in georgettes and
laces ; but rubber surf-sirens on every table
testified that the best-loved costume was a
one-piece swimming suit. President H. A.
Rose entertained Mayor Mostyn and his lady
and Randwick’s civic heads, R. M. Dunning-
liam and his wife.
Tresillian Mothercraft Training Centre
had a little bid for financial uplift on Satur-
day, when some admirers of its good work
gave what they termed an “American tea"
—you pay for yourself and as many others
as you feel inclined to; you bring things
to furnish stalls and buy them back again.
But then at Tresillian they always manage
to have at least one prize baby who has
been restored from delicate health, and what
greater reward does anyone need for attend-
ing even such a “tea” as that? Matron
Carmichael and the sisters presided over the
tea-serving, and Mrs. W. P. McElhone pre-
sided over one of the stalls which made a
market of the spacious verandah.
Slim little Con Seaver’s American accent
has charmed tall Jimmie Riddle into the pro-
duction of a platinum and diamond soli-
taire. Grand-dad Captain Riddle was a
popular Hobart salt.
Dr. Howard Bullock has gone abroad to
discover what fresh laurels he can add to
his surgical fame. He transplanted his wife
and very young family, a trio of babies,
the youngest two months old, and a
few nurses by the last outgoing American
steamer. Mrs. Bullock was Miss Macken—
one of the Mark Foy Mackens.

The Breatheable Remedy for
COUGHS, COLDS,
& BRONCHITIS.
j
\i
PEPS fumes are breathed through (1)
the nasal cavity (2) month, carried
over the tongue (3) into the throat (4)
whence they pass down the windpipe
(5) into the lungs, Liquid mixtures
simply go down the gullet (6) into
the stomach.
HTHE only safe and effective method
of treating Coughs, Colds, Sore
Throat and Bronchitis is to take Peps,
the breatheable medicine that goes
direct to the root of the trouble in the
bronchial tubes and lungs.
pEPS owe their remarkable
potency to certain volatile
chest-strengthening medicines
which are concentrated in
handy tablet form.
When you remove the silver
wrapping and let a Peps tablet
slowly dissolve in the mouth,
powerful healing and germicidal
fumes are given off. These Peps
medicinal fumes are (as the
ibove diagram shows) carried
with the breath down the
throat and bronchials deep into
the lungs and not simply into
the stomach where liquid medi-
cine goes.
%
Peps clear, disinfect and
strengthen the entire respiratory
tract, and destroy mischievous
germs. They heal sore, inflamed
membrane, quickly dispel the
symptoms of coughs, colds and
bronchial trouble and help to
avert threatening complications.
Peps contain no laudanum,
chloral or other dangerous
drugs. Peps have solved the
problem of treating throat and
bronchial ailments in a safe,
direct and rational way.
Peps are as indispensable to
the traveller, theatre-goer and
schoolchild as they are to
patient and nurse in the sick
room.
Dr. GORDON STABLES,
M.D., C.M., says: “Peps are ex-
ceptionally suited for the treat-
ment of Bronchial ailments,
owing to their direct influence
on the membranes of the
bronchi and their .freedom from
laudanum, chloral and other
risky narcotics.”
THE HANDY TABLET MEDICINE
PEPS are recognised as the safest and best home
treatment for coughs, colds, catarrh, bronchitis ,
wheeziness, bronchial asthma, sore throat, laryngitis,
influenza and infectious throat troubles. Peps are
obtainable of chemists everywhere; family size, 3f-.

Chatter
Attendance at Moonee Valley races on
Saturday was big' enough to bring smites to
the faces of committeemen. The new stand
in the members’ reserve was used for the
first time, and was as crowded as the others.
The grounds were looking particularly fresh
and green, the wattle-trees about the car-
parking area were tipped with yellow bloom,
and the hedge of roses bordering the lawns
showed cheery glimpses of red and white.
Skies were ‘ leaden and lowering, but there
was no rain. It was a case of covering last
year’s frock with a top-coat, preferably a
fur one, and a felt hat. The G.-G. was
there, with a look in his eye that denoted
the student of form. Some of the dressing
struck a new note. One maiden wore a
one-piece frock that had a top of natural
kasha, the skirt of nigger brown, and sleeves
of fur from wrist to elbow. An attractive
get-up was a long coat and felt hat of
powder blue, allied to grey silk hose, and
shoes with blue heels. A mink coat inlet
with gathered bands of chenille embossed
georgette was another effective notion. The
popularity of civet fur upon tailored suit
and coat Avas a feature of the apparelling.
A kid coat in tones of grey attracted. The
Odell Crowther lady was a study in deep
wine tones. Dr. Eleanor Keam, who hails
from Maoriland and is our only woman
osteopath, was suited in navy blue with felt
hat of enamel green-hue. The Gus Hiskens
couple, the Stanley Argyles and Dr. Murray
Morton, perking up for the first time after
a serious illness, were seen in the saddling
paddock. Mrs. Philip Glass wore mushroom
pink, fur trimmed, with a beige felt hat.
Mollie Ryan, back from Europe, showed what
could be done with velvet in a dress and
toque of bottle-green shade. Dorothy Bridges,
Jean Hunter, Mollie and Phyllis Walsh and
Peggy Essington King were among the
smartly- and comfortably-clad bachelor girls.
The first of the Hunt Club race meetings
was that of the Melbourne club, at Sandown
Park. This suburban course, though only
about half an hour’s tram-ride from town,
is in quite a back-blocky neighborhood, lying
in picturesque country between Caulfield and
Dandenong. The course is sheltered by a
natural break-wind of gums, tea-trees and
tall pines. The chief interest of the after-
noon was the Melbourne Hunt Steeplechase,
won by M. Oliver’s Flowering Gum, the
favorite, with E. O'Connor up. A cattle-
dog, misunderstanding the hurry, joined the
chase in the straight and was well up at
the finish. Weather was, grey, with a sky
that was inclined to the tearful, so top-
coats and furs had an outing. Plush-House
president Frank Clarke’s wife was there in
a tailored suit of dark grey, topped by a
felt hat of the same tone. With her was
Mrs. Robert Knox, whose orange-hued jersey
frock made a splash of color in contrast with
a wrap of natural kasha cloth and millinery
combining shades of putty and brown. Mrs.
Embling was accompanied by her daughter
Lorna, who showed a black eye as result
of a recent fall in the chase. Mollie Wall
was a bright speck in a cherry-red frock and
hat; the Mackey lady enlivened a black
tailored suit with a jade-green hat; Marie
Mackinnon was green-coated and red-liatted
and Joan Chirnside had a felt hat of beige
hue allied to a long and handsome coat of
beaver. Nell Wimpole, Mrs. Albert Weigall,
a couple of Madden girls, Violet Farmer,
Peggy fliskens and Mrs. A. F. Joyce were
glimpsed among the crowd.
Ten charming maidens made a triumphal
entrance into the social whirl of Colling-
wood the other evening at the Mayoral ball.
Prettily frocked alike in white taffeta, with
full skirts that slipped from tight-fitting
bodices and were hemmed with deep pink
tulle, and carrying posies of water-lilies and
pink blooms, their approach was announced
by heralds. One of the debs, was the Mayoral
Ivanes’ daughter Maisie. Mrs. Kane, who re-
ceived the guests in a ball-room that was a
glowing symphony of royal-blue and gold,
Shimmered softly in a robe of opalescent
pailettes mingled with a ray or two of purple
that blended with a bouquet of shaded pan-
sies. Some of the Ministers and their life-
partners were there.
The spectacle of a secretary of Girl
Guides and a barrister with shingled hair
pairing with two brave youths and stepping
out the old folk dances of Merrie England
was part of a programme given at Scott's
by the English-Speaking Union the other
evening. Folk-music and -dancing were the
themes and Fritz Hart spoke about them
with vocal illustrations by Jean Hambleton
and Millicent Osmond, Ida Scott being at the
piano. Agnes Gloyne, a representative of
the English Folk Dance Society founded by
Gecil Sharp, talked about the old dances.
She came to Australia some months ago and
has been stimulating South Australia to an
interest in the traditional measures. She
did a couple of morris dances.
The Geelong Church of England Gram-
mar School had a red-letter day on Friday,
when a war memorial to the 88 ex-students
who didn’t come back was dedicated. This
tribute from the old boys consists of a
cloister of Gothic architecture that curves
from the chapel doors to the main quad-
rangle. Within the curve, upon a tall, mas-
sive pedestal, is raised a bronze group de-
signed and sculptured by artist George Lam-
bert. It depicts two war-worn soldiers
crushed by the weight of an eagle, above
which rises a figure of a nude young war-
rior, who has transfixed the bird with a
sword. The G.-G. unveiled the memorial,
and the dedication service was conducted by
Archgaiters Lees. Present-day boys in the
khaki of the citizen forces formed a guard
of honor, and a squad of buglers, in cream
flannels and pale blue sports blazers and
caps, sounded the “Last Post.” The white-
surpliced choristers were a younger group,
and there were hundreds more in the grey-
uniform of the school. About 1500 guests
also assembled to honor the dead. Dr. E. It.
White, president of the old Geelong Gram-
marians’ Association, handed over the mem-
orial to the school.
Picked out in rosy lights that culminated
in a golden crown, the Fitzroy Town Hall
looked like a York welcome on the night of
the Mayoral hop. Mayor T. M. Foley
and his wife couldn’t shake hands with all
of the 900 guests. The Mayoress carried a
bouquet of pink blooms against a green-blue
gown a-glitter with gold and silver. Her
daughter, still at school, dangled two plaits
over her much-tucked white frock. Besides a
whole raft of Mayors, Aldermen and Council-
lors and their belongings were Forestry Min-
ister Beckett and his wife, she with black
and berry-red bead embroidery upon her
black robe, and T. Tunnecliffe, Minister of
llaihvays, whose better half had fuchsia-
liued georgette allied to silver lace. Mrs. J.
Foley came to the party in covering of
golden tone, and Kit Foley was arrayed in
filmy-black lace.
The spirit of the pioneers inspires Sister
Muriel Peck, formerly head of the Victorian
Baby Centre.
The Govern-
ment has now
made her Dr.
Vera Scantle-
bury’s assist-
ant in the work
of saving the
babi e s. Re-
jected for war
service, Sister
Muriel was put
in charge o f
the State’s
first Centre
when it was
opened at
Richmond 10
years ago:
since then she
has lectured
a n d demon-
strated inde-
fatigably. Her
book, “Your
Baby,” has reached every outback settle-
ment. She invented a safety cot which doc-
tors are enthusiastic about. She took charge
of the baby welfare section of the Better
Farming Train, and the carriage was all
too small for audiences that often were
assembled from all parts of a district 100
miles wide. Fellow workers at Melbourne
Centre recently sent Sister Muriel a present
of books.
The A. S. Austin couple’s home at Toorak
was the scene of a dance for the Church
of England Boys’ Home at Canterbury on
Thursday evening. Mrs. Harold Clapp, who
heads the committee of the institution,
induced a number of young people to sell
tickets, and there was a good muster. The
floral setting was a blending of _ pink blos-
soms and mauve irises. Unfortunately the
chatelaine of Eilyer and her husband were
under the weather with colds, so their
daughter Hope, who was ticket secretary,
had to do the honors. She was in white,
sparkling with silver and crystal beads. Mrs.
Clapp covered a fussy taffeta frock of
petunia hue with a cape, of magenta velvet.
The James Purves matron, who was robed in
hyacintli-blue georgette, traced with fanciful
glitterings, was one of the managers, aided by
Mrs. S. J. Sfaughton, whose pink gown was
veiled with fine black lace. Among the
dancers were the two good-looking Shackell
girls, Aimee in geranium pink and Betty
in a foam of lime-green georgette; Aileen
Taylor, in combined silver and blue lace, with
pale pink georgette; Chic Dickenson in
cherry-red georgette; and Elsa Andrew,
whose fairness was set off by sky-blue taffeta.
Florrie Green, Iris Connoliy, Margaret Gil-
ruth and Mrs. Robert Hamilton also arrested
the eye.
Here is Monte Luke’s impression of Doro-
thy Stanward, the clever little Caulfield girl
who is play-
ing Tondeleyo
i the Firm’s
‘White Cargo”
touring com-
pany. Not long
ago she was
one of the star
performers at
the Con., where
one o f the
Taits saw her
and put her on
with Mosco-
witch. Then
Leon Gordon
chose her to
umlers tudy
Judith Ander-
son in “The
Green H a t,”
but before that
play was pro-
duced she was
sent post haste
to Sydney to take up her present role. The
company has done the not-so-smalls as far
North as Cairns, and will soon be seen in
the larger Victorian towns.
A mixed musical menu was served at the
Assembly Hall on Thursday night by stu-
dents of the Albert-street Con., when a repeti-
tion by the Melba Gonservatorium Ladies’
Choir of “Natural Magic,” a recent, composi-
tion by Fritz Hart, was the main dish. Out-
standing pianistic talent was shown by Viva
Clarke in a Liszt “Rhapsodic,” to which
Harold Elvins contributed a second piano
background. Myrtle Frazier, Eleanor Clap-
ham and Pearl Yates were players, too, and
Ida Walker, Jean Lewis and Lily McMahon
raised their voices in song. Mary Gaskins
and Nellie White tucked their fiddles under
their chins and drew forth sweet sounds. Ida
Scott was a good accompanist.
At Caulfield’s mayoral ball Mayor and
Mayoress F. W. Porter greeted 600 guests.
The hostess was in phlox-pink with much
sparkle. A dozen bonnie debutantes, in
white frocks with floral adornment, danced
a minuet as curtain-raiser to their first
public foxtrot. Hazel, the flapper daughter
of the host and hostess, who was at the ball
in a soft white frock, though not out yet,
trained the buds for their stately dance.
Nuptial Mass, with Archbishop Mannix to
do the knot-tying, featured the wedding of
Pat Cody and Kathleen Dillon on Thursday
morning at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Early
wattle glorified the sanctuary. Carrickma-
cross and Limerick lace with a gleam of pink
beneath formed veil and train over the
bride’s gown of vellum-toned moire, with em-
broidery of pearls and diamente. Her sisters
Muriel and Mollie attended her in gowns of
coral pink chiffon velvet, topped by felt hats
of the same color. They carried muffs of
tulle, dangling orchids and other blooms.
Captain Feakes, who put in his Australian
term in the healthy but select locality of
Flinders Base, is now in Geneva as Aus-
tralia’s spokesman on the Naval Reduction
Commission. Mrs. Feakes, who went to the
Cold Country with him, was left in London
to enjoy a family reunion and set up a new
home.
King Butters, of Canberra, who is here
on holiday after more than two years’ exile,
came down determined to wipe the Terri-
tory out of his mind, but fate willed it other-
wise. He gets so much attention from
people who want to grind a little axe in the
capital that lie now turns a grim, pained
smile to those who give him kindly greeting
or an unexpected slap on the back.
Only another Royal visit could shake us
out of the lethal slump that followed the
Yorks’ exit, and the unexpected is about to
happen, without fanfare of trumpets or
gaudy decorations. He is the heir-apparent
to the throne of Siam. Somdet Char Sukom-
bandhu is part of a name so long that no-
body can remember it. He speaks more lan-
guages than the average citizen thought
existed, was educated at Harrow and Oxford,
wears the uniform of a major-general and is
quite the Beau Sabreur. His visit will be
brief.
An engagement is announced between Alli-
son, eldest daughter of the A. S. Drurys,
Ballarat, and Harold, youngest son of the
Harry Davies pair, of the National Bank,
Richmond.
Janet, only daughter of the D. A. Millies,
of Geelong, has got herself engaged to
Ronald, youngest son of the late D. 11. Sal-
mon and Mrs. Salmon, of the same town.
Seemingly, there are not many musicians
with an eye on the hereafter, for players
of the harp are unobtainable in this city.
Since Hilda Roberts was forced a couple of
months ago to take a holiday through illness,
her place as harpist in the “Rose Marie”
orchestra has not been filled. The absence
of the instrument is felt.
At the Norman Brookes’ home on Thurs-
day, over 11 o’clock tea, there was talk
about the programme for Animal Week. The
fancy dress matinee dance for children to
come on at St. Kilda Town Hall on July lt>
was reported to be well in hand. To collect
gifts for a lucky tree, Mrs. Brookes is engin-
eering weekly sewing-bees. A hop arranged
by Mrs. Harold Clapp is to be staged at
the Embassy on July 5.
The latest venture of the Royal Victorian
Institute for the Blind is a hostel for blind
girls who have no other home when they
have finished with schooling. The house
with its green roof and wide verandahs has
accommodation for 10 or 11 girls in airy
bedrooms with two or three beds in each,
and radio is laid on. S. W. Hedger, matron
Mrs. Biggs and the architect put their heads
together to make moving about in the hostel
as simple as possible for the sightless
boarders. On an afternoon last week the
place was gay with Iceland poppies and gum-
tips for an official opening, and the matron-
in-charge, Mrs. Blake, was getting things
ready for her charges. The land was given
by tbe Government, and donations from other
sources have paid for the building and
furnishing. It is the intention later on to
erect on a part of the land a similar hostel
for boys, and there’s room for additions. At
the opening, president J. L. Carnegie gave
greeting to Mayor Morell and his lady and
others. Vice-president Jim Angus and some
other speakers told how the thing was done,
and the tea-cups clattered and tongues chat-
tered.
Mary Allen is having three meals of art
each day on her leisurely rambles through
Europe. In Baris she fan across the Novars
—not in the Batin Quarter—and that kindly
couple invited her to the autumn party at
Raitli, their Scottish homestead. The Aus-
tralian abroad, who is the Allen lady's elder
girl, has a fancy for painting which she
hopes to nourish.
Our Governor-General’s lady is just a
trifle peeved at the mouthful most folk here
make of her name. Victorians drawl
“Stone-liay-ven,” whereas the acceptable way
of it is “Stun-rr-vun.”
Those kindly folk who give up so much of
their leisure to transcribe books for the
Braille Library for the Blind have placed
the Melbourne institution third in the world
in respect of the number of works available.
The voluntary workers include members of
the Time and Talents Society, who have
stitched and prepared the sheets for the
bookbinder. A sideline to the library is the
teaching of sightless folk to read and write
Braille. Last week the committee, headed
by the secretary, Miss M. Crabb, and Mil-
licent Ritchie, the entertainments secretary,
held a sale of articles made by folk who can-
not go to the Blind Institution for instruc-
tion. There was a good array of cane and
raffia baskets and other articles, and lots of
knitted woollen garments. In connection
with the library is a fine hall warmed with
hot-water pipes. The stage has a quaint
fireplace and artistic stained-glass windows,
a memorial gift from one of numerous)!
friends. The library and hall were made
possible by donations from two benefactors.
The Victorian Association of Braille Writers
also supports a small seaside holiday home
at Chelsea.
The National Council of Women has been
exercising itself over the exploitation of
children on the stage tor gain. The subject
was brought on late in the evening, after a
lot of other things had been settled, and as
no one seemed to be primed with instances
of wrong-doing, it was decided to hold the
matter over until some more light broke.
Members of the council who subscribed to-
wards a golden wedding gift for Lady Aber-
deen have the satisfaction of knowing their
contributions helped to purchase a motor-
car presented in unison by branches all
over the world. Mrs. H. Fossctt, the Mel-
bourne secretary, has had to call a halt
from service for a few months owing to ill-
health, and Mrs. Peter Tait has taken over
her honorary duties.
Mollie Beer smiled on the crowd bidden to
Old Admiralty House to celebrate her arrival
at the age where one may vote. The younger
set held the floor for dancing, but the older
generation had their hour later, at a supper
served at the Elsternwick home, where
Mollie’s dad spends his brief hours of
leisure away from patients in Collins-street.
The A. A. Sachses and the Legges helped
with the entertaining.
Mrs. Louisa Smith has made the Little
Arts Club happy by the gift of a slice of
ground adjoining her Kew rooftree. All the
society now needs is a theatre to plant on
the allottment, and ways and means are
under discussion. Performances are at pre-
sent given in the Queen’s Ilall, where the
stage is hardly suitable for dramatic pur-
poses.

able performance, Republic bridge-strong chassis
frames are always ready to stand the racket of
continuous capacity-carrying under even the rough-
est of road conditions. Husky—scientifically cross-

rugged carrying strength, they are the strongest,
toughest, most sturdy frames that money can buy.
Every inch, from the front axle to the rear cross
members —even right down to the rivets —has been
designed to keep the truck everlastingly on the job
—to cut down to a minimum repairs and replace-
ments— TO WORK AT A PROFIT under Aus-
tralian conditions.
The whole job, with hbeam rear axle, powerful

Brisbane.
The Press Institute asked our new Gov-
ernor and his wife to a luncheon at the
Cecil, with the M. L. Readings at the head
of an array of tables decked with golden
early wattle. There were special souvenir
menu cards, advertising some of Queens-
land's charms, and there were only two
speeches, both good. President M. L. Read-
ing made one and his Ex. made the other.
The newcomer rather upset us by saying
that the view from Brisbane's One-Tree Hill
irresistibly reminded him of the Himalayas
—we didn’t think it was as desolate as that
—but he salved the wound by saying that
he'd read Mrs. Forrest’s books and liked
them, and had heard of our veteran, journal-
ist Spencer-Browne and of Cumbrae Stew-
art, K.C. Tessa Reading, in figured crepe
de Chine with ivory furs and blue hat, pre-
sented a posy of violets, pansies and golden
roses to Lady Goodwin, Avho wore a navy
tailormade with fur stole and black velvet
hat. Mrs. Reading had a gown of navy
charmante and fringe, with brown furs and
hat of black and turquoise. Mrs. N. A. 11.
Campbell, who was with the Government
House party, set off her fresh complexion
with navy and beige, worn under skunk furs.
Lady Goodwin and Mrs. Campbell went
on to a welcome arranged at the Women’s
Club, which was radiant with wattle and
poinsettia. Mrs. F. H. Wedd handed over
a bunch of pink sweet pea and gerberas.
Mrs. Espie Bods, Adeline College and Vada
Jeffrey made music, and Rhoda Felgate
recited. Golden-haired Eunice Cochrane
arranged the programme.
In the evening the new vice-regents went
to the Grammar boys’ breaking-up concert
in the Theatre Royal, which was packed.
Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were with them.
The Bousfields received, and Lady Goodwin
got yet another bouquet of sweet peas and
roses.
The Presswomen gathered in Rowe’s to
tea The Bulletin’s Nora Kelly at a table
decorated with Iceland poppies and tango
and kewpie dolls, and she was handed a posy
of red roses. There were no speeches but
there was much chatter.
Pretty Mary Macdonald, of the long eye-
lashes, was married to Walter MacTaggart
at St. Andrew’s this week. The bride was
in white crepe de Chine and veil of white
tulle, and Mrs. Ross Philp was matron of
honor in pale pink.
“Katja” and “Frasquita” had a splendid
run here. With the company, understudying
Warde Morgan, is Michael Foran, who used
to sing tenor with the Pat Hanna Diggers.
He is something of a find for the Firm, as
added to a good stage appearance he has
a sweet and powerful voice. He was gassed
in France, but got over it.
Melba had a concert in the Exhibition,
and even against the outside wall hung the
people like flies after the honey of the Voice
inside. On her return journey she is giving
two popular concerts.
Died on June 19, Marie Agnes Deshon,
widow of Dr. F. Deshon, of Victoria, and
mother of Mrs. Hannibal King, whose hus-
band manages the Bank of ’Asia here. She
kept her good looks and her keen interest
in Australian literature to the end.
The Wright-Moxon wedding at St.
Thomas’s, Toowong, was staged amid white
flowers and greenery. Herbert Alan Wright
is second son of A. C. Wright, of Brisbane,
and the bride is May, daughter of the Thomas
Moxons, of Toowong. The bride was in
ivory satin broidered in silk, and seed pearls.
Her tulle veil was fastened with orange-
blossoms, and the IToniton-lace train, over
a century old, was lent by her sister, Mrs.
M. D. Briggs. Rose Doak and Sybil Lucas,
in pussy-willow, patterned in pink roses and
forget-me-nots, ’maided.
TASMANIA,
Hobart.
The Cafe Chantant at the Town Hall for
the children’s branch of the Public Library
was a big affair, with 37 tables. Music was
made by Mrs. Douglas Nettlefold and Mrs.
If. Gibbons, Mrs. Helen George, the Scott-
Powers (father and daughter), and others.
The wife of Chief Justice Nicholls, pic-
tured here by
Jack Cato, is
one of the stal-
warts of the
Child Welfare
movement in
this State.
Somew h e r e
about 1917 she
and Mrs. Edith
W ater worth
formed an as-
sociation, o f
which the
Mother craft
Home is the
outward and
visible sign.
Mr s. Water-
worth was its
first secretary,
and the other
lady was, and
still is, presi-
dent.
When Bessie Lauda, the 'cellist, married
Dr. IT. Barnett of New Town at the
synagogue, she wore a dress of ivory panne
velvet with inset of frilled ivory georgette,
the folds caught with a big rhinestone clasp.
The long veil had a border of silk and silver
embroidery, and a half-circle of orange blos-
som made a tiara-like effect across the front
of the head. She carried a mascot in the
shape of a silk-covered horseshoe on a white
ribbon, as well as a posy of white roses
and sweet peas. Daphne Benjamin ’maided
in turquoise-blue georgette, and carried a
small posy with long streamers.
Henri Segaert, Consul-General for Bel-
gium. and his wife spent a couple of days
in Hobart while the Norwegian motor-boat
Tancred, on which they had taken a trip
to the South Sea Islands, was in port. There
was no formal entertainment, but the Tom
Murdochs dined and tea’d them, and the
C. W. Grants took them to their mountain
fastness, High Peak.
Captain Ilendriksen. of the Norwegian
motor-ship Tancred, gave a dinner on board
here, and introduced his guests to a meal
served in Scandinavian fashion. A feature
of the banquet was that, though light wines
were served with all the courses, a large
goblet of beer was kept constantly replen-
ished at each place, the wines being to please
the palate and the beer to satisfy the thirst.
About 300 guests answered the bidding
of the wardroom officers of the Naval Re-
serve and went to a ball at the Continental.
His Ex. and Margaret O’Grady and the
C.J. and his lady were there. Mrs. Mac-
farlane wore jade-green. Mrs. Jess was
attractive in red, and there was a big crowd
of folk with naval and military connections.
Premier and Mrs. Lyons have welcomed
number seven. It’s a boy. • The Speck is

WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Three one-act plays staged by the Reper-
tory Club gave members and their friends a
jolly evening. “The Bishop’s Candlesticks,”
by Victor Hugo, offered Nan Smith her big
chance, and she took it. “No Servants,” pat-
ted into shape by Barbara Dale-Smith, con-
tained a scene in which a chicken was
roasted* —a really, truly chicken and a really
truly roast. “The Lost Silk Hat” was the
third offering.
This is Bardwell Clarke’s portrait of
Marcia Hodges, whose sweet mezzo-soprano
got lots of
praise last
e i s t e ddfod,
where she won
the champion-
ship for sing-
ing and one of
the three spe-
cia 1 gold
medals
awarded fo r
marked talent.
A pupil of
Rose Atkin-
son, she is a
good pianist
as well as a
warbler of
promise. She
has appeared
several times
in amateur
t h e a tricals,
and is, besides,
a gra dua t e
with honors of Perth University.
Mary Williams took trunk-loads of filmy
trousseau to Singapore. Her marriage with
Bob Hawson will take place on July 11, and
the couple will start housekeeping in a bun-
galow in Malacca. They first met at the
Perth ’Varsity, where the bride-to-be gradu-
ated in Arts and he learned engineering.
“The Girl in the Taxi,” chaperoned by the
Concert Artists, arrives on July 1 for a 10-
nights’ visit. “The Devil’s Disciple” is to be
staged with a Repertory cast of 30 at the
Assembly Hall.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
The Citizens’ Committee for the Royal
visit wound up its affairs with £l4OO in
hand. The money is- to pay for a children's
playground—the Princess Elizabeth. This
will give us in all about half a dozen within
the city boundaries. The scheme originated
when Mayor Glover ruled the city, and three
of the grounds are directly due to him.
Victor Harbor is pluming itself on having
Victorian vice-royalty on its visitors’ list.
They have golfed and motored and seen
the approved sights, and Lady Somers set
the final seal on her popularity by dropping*
in at the Girl Guide bazaar with an appre-
ciative word for the troop and its captain,
the Frank Douglases’ daughter.
There was a good attendance at the open-
ing of the Syd Long exhibition at the Dun-
ster Galleries. Archibald Strong said the
opening words. He had a retrospective
glance at Australian art, and praise for its
freedom from the faddism and cliqueism of
older countries.
Mrs. Kenenth Duffield, brown-eyed, brown-
haired and charming, was among the South
Australians presented at the last drawing-
room. The Gordon lady (wife of David J.)
and Mrs. Villeneuve Smith were her fellows.
Except for private entertaining, graziers
have kept themselves solidly to business
while they’ve been conferencing, but there
was a vast theatre-party for their wives,
hostessed by Mrs. E. A. Brooks, whose hus-
band is the conference’s president.
There has been fox-hunting from Marino
on the coast back through the low southern
hills to the Happy Valley reservoir and on
to the head of Tapley’s Hill —a run that
gave some tricky going (there was a maxi-
mum of falls with a minimum of damage)—-
while road-followers had an excellent view
of pink coats stringing across the country
and a close-up of a good many road doubles.
If its popularity as a spectacle increases,
the club will have to issue a book of etiquette
for road-followers. The congestion of motors
at the doubles is amazing, and they don’t
always make sure that all riders are through
before cutting across to the next jump.
The Kindergarten Ball, in the hands of
a committee headed by Mrs. Lav Bonytlion,
scored its usual success. An item of the
decorations was a huge Dutch windmill, from
which some of Nora Stewart’s pupils de-
scended for a Dutch dance. There was a
solo dance, too, by Betty and Ada Bony-
thon and some specialty dancing by Mrs.
Harry Armstrong and J. M. Robertson.
Earlier in the week the Presbyterian Girls’
College had its annual dance —the decora-
tions the school’s blue and gold.

“Up North": The northern busliman can
now earn a crust by snake- anti alligator-
hunting. Thousands of crocodile skins are
imported to Australia yearly, though there
are plenty of crocs, in our own waters. A
sft. tanned skin is worth about £2; any-
thing larger is unsuitable for present uses.
Tanning is a difficult job, and there is a
knack in the skinning. The ’go’s overcoat, is
also of value, and a well-marked snakeskin
is worth 2s. a foot. It must be broad —not
k a thin strip.
THE INKY WAY.
“Croesus”: Sunraysia Daily, founded by
C. J. De Garis in Mildura and run for some
time at a loss, is now on its feet and re-
cently there was a 14-page issue. Earle
Page and P. G. Stewart, now own
a substantial share.
“Vaurien”: Charles P. Smith, who has
been war correspondent, chief of staff and
assistant general manager of the Abgus,
leaves Melbourne for Perth next month to
become managing editor of the West AUS-
TRALIAN.
“G.D.M.": “Peter A.” (B. 23/0/’27) men-
tions that he has bought The Bulletin at
the same shop every week for 27 years. 1
claim the record for the number of places
in which I’ve got mine. I bought the secoivl
number in Bendigo 47 years ago, and I
don't think I've missed a dozen copies since,
though I’ve had to pick them up in all parts
of the world.
“Jalan Dawat”: London Punch should
polish up its geography. On the occasion
of the Canberra frostivities it came out with
a cartoon by Bernard Partridge depicting
“Miss Canberra” as a debutante exposing
arms and shoulders in a diaphanous costume.
Furs would have been more in place. One
recent week the thermometer at the capital
stuck at 11 below freezing, the Molonglo
was hard enough to skate on and the radia-
tors of motor-cars burst with the cold.
“ J. 8.”: It is a rare thing to find a
printer’s error in The Bulletin, but a tri-
lling one slipped through the other week in
some verses I had written. I happily men-
tioned it to Rod. Quinn. He brushed it
aside contemptuously. “That!” he said—
“that’s nothing. I one time wrote a set of
verses headed ‘The Blithesome Bird,’ and
when I saw it in print the heading read,
‘The Blithered Bard’.”
“Harold Hardupp”: Passmore struggles
gamely along with a conversational little jour-
nal in a cheap setting,, and sees nothing humor-
ous in jokes about the circulation of his rag.
“Things must be looking up with you, Tom,”
said an Inky friend who met him the other
day. “I saw a man buy a copy of the
Tittle Tattle last week.” Passmore flushed
angrily. “Our circulation may have gone
down a little,” he admitted, “but there was
a time when the Tittle Tattle went into
tens of thousands of homes, and it'll do it
again.” The other grinned, and gave the
steel a twist.” Do you really think the
Government will ever again let the butchers
wrap their meat in newspaper?” he asked.
“Hamer”: Sydney Uni. gets £lO,OOO of
the £12,270 which the S. M. Herald collected
from Lang's ha’penny tax on newspapers be-
fore the High Court declared it illegal; the
balance goes to country hospitals. The abor-
tive tax ihay supply a more accurate estimate
of the bona fide circulation of Sydney dailies
than is to be derived from auditors’ reports.
Odie Herald's distribution figures show
5.880,600 ha’pence collected over 53 days,
which means an average daily sale of
111,124; but, as 10 per cent, for tax collec-
tion by agents was allowed, and the paper
is retaining enough to pay income-tax
charges, its circulation may be placed as
well over 122,000 daily—even during the
three-ha’nenee period. With that and the
goldmine in its advertising pages, the
Hunter-street journal should have been able
to afford more than £25 for a prize poem;
still, most other dailies in similar circum-
stances would have taken the opportunity
to make a nauseating brag about the figures.
Granny may be mean, but she is still
ladylike.
“Wodgil”: The imported craze for news-
paper beauty competitions is dying in an
atmosphere of hysteria and mudslinging. The
Smith papers ran what they called a “Miss
Australia” competition and exultantly
started another; but months ago it became
evident that people were sated with back-
page photographs of half-naked flappers.
Some of these works of art were exhibited
at a pony racecourse, and an obliging bag-
man made a book on the event, while a
Smith reporter dutifully took down the re-
marks of pony grandees on the contestants;
hut even this failed to arrest the slump.
Then the N.S.W. winner mysteriously with-
drew, and the runner-up was as mysteriously
set aside, the prize being awarded to the girl
placed third. The public is now being re-
galed with another of those Pott-and-Slurk
controversies which ennoble the journalism
of the Million City.
“TJramao”: John Hardcastle, a good all-
round performer on the M.L. Inky AN ay.
dropped out the other day', aged 81. Origi-
nallv a schoolmaster, he joined up with the
Timaru Herald in 1879, remaining with
the paper till his retirement four years ago.
But the flair for writing possessed him to
the end ; on the evening of his sudden death
lie had just returned from handing in some
copy at the Herald office. As a diversion
John dabbled in geology, and a book of his
on the geology of South Canterbury is
regarded as authoritative. All three sons have
following in dad’s footsteps, Harry being a
special writer and Allan a reporter on the
Wellington Post, while John is associate
editor of the Auckland Star.
“Spare Sub”: The recent outbreak of
shooting cases in Sydney leads one to won-
der why the daily press invariably refers to
the weapon used as a “revolver,” whether the
antiquated instrument with the revolving
“tumbler” which gave it its name is really
one. or actually the much more popular
modern automatic pistol. The revolver, even
of the smallest size, is heavy, impossible to
be properly concealed, and is hideously in-
accurate. even at close range. Moreover, its
penetration is wanting, a thick suit of
clothes sufficing to let the target off with a
flesh wound in nine cases out of ten. The
automatic, flat, light and fitting accurately
to the person—some efficient makes will fit
in a waistcoat pocket—is as accurate as a
rifle up to any distance necessary for shoot-
ing one’s acquaintance in the street, while
its high-velocity bullet will penetrate the
hide of a M.L.A. at a distance of 100 yards.
None of the flash lads who habitually hump
“guns”—a term for which we must thank
Hollywood—would ever hold his head up
again if he was arrested with a “revolver
on him. As for bringing one into play, even
in an informal social shoot —why, it simply
isn't done.

If to-day’s American picture fiend were
shown a film of 15 or 20 years ago he would
probably guess that dad was a soft mark
to pay money for it. But he couldn’t have
got to-day’s productions if he hadn’t had
those of 15 or 20 years ago ; and Australia
can’t expect to start just at the point that
Hollywood has reached. It won't be so
long attaining the perfection of technique,
of course, because it will have other coun-
tries’ experience to help; but in its early
big efforts there are bound to be flaws, and
naturally, if the pictures deal with Aus-
tralian life, we shall have less difficulty in
spotting them than we should in films deal-
ing with somebody else’s life. So it happens
that while the Australian can detect a few
anachronisms and absurdities in “For the
Term of llis Natural Life,” the American
will pass them unnoticed, while lie no doubt
sees plenty of American pictures that strike
us as perfect.

The story itself is so well known in these
parts that its presentation on the screen may
seem to ramble; but in this respect it is no
worse than a hundred others which we have
received with great applause. And, if there
are times when we miss the thrill that
Marcus Clarke gave us in his book, there
are other times when the film makes the
tragedy more vivid—the pathetic scene in
which the twm boys, despairing of their
“THE GHOST TRAIN,” AT SYDNEY CRITERION.
Teddy (Basil Radford ) sees the humor of the station-
master’s ghost-train story, hut Miss Bourne
(Laura Smithson ) is chilled to the marrow.
fate, link hands and throw themselves over
the cliff is one bit of genuine drama. The
tortures and the miseries of the chain-gang
(taken at too swift a tempo) are well pic-
tured too; and the beauties of bush and
beach, of mountain range and river are
vividly reproduced. The characters are gen-
erally well chosen. Rufus Dawes (George
Fisher) is a manly fellow; Eva Novak a
pretty heroine; Gabbett’s teeth flash evilly
in the cannibal scene and there is excellent
acting by others. As a whole, no doubt,
the picture is less Australian than we could
wish. It has been said, indeed, that Aus-
tralia merely provides the “location.” But
it may be not the less true for that. Did
Australia provide much more in the original
drama? The actors did not become what
to-day we should regard as Australians be-
cause they happened to have been dragged
across the Line a few months before. And
if the cast is more American than we shall
expect casts to be a year or two hence—
well, the business has to get a start. Even
the business of running a gaol had to get
a start with imported “leads.” The picture
is showing in Sydney at the Crystal Palace,
and is due for the support of all that big
section of the population which has been
crying aloud for an Australian .film-industry.
The King’s Hall, Sydney, is proving alto-
gether too small for the crowds which want
to hear Alexander Watson. On Saturday
night the house-full sign was posted at 25
minutes before the opening, and a continuous
stream of people was turned away. The
veteran elocutionist, now making his fifth
visit, opened to the packed audience with
a clever abridgement of Barrie’s “The Little
Minister,” covering the thread of the love-
story between the dour parson and the
spirited “gipsy” girl with a delightfully-
whimsical realisation of the characters. Rud-
yard Kipling, Masefield and A. A. Milne
provided the items for the rest of the pro-
gramme, one of Milne’s being that master-
piece of child-like nonsense, “The King’s
Breakfast.” Perhaps because he does not
wish to bring tears, Watson gives an impres-
sion of being short of tear-producing quali-
ties ; but his humor is captivating, and his
clear diction helps the spirit that goes into
such items as Masefield’s “Ballad of Cape St.
Vincent.” The elocutionist changes his pro-
gramme nightly. Dickens has not been neg-
lected, nor have Kipling and Barrie. To-night
scenes from “Romeo and Juliet” and “The
Tempest” make Sliakspeare the star; “The
Little Minister” is to be repeated on Mon-
day.

“Rain,” by Somerset Maugham, will pour
upon the stage of Sydney Theatre Royal on
Saturday, Judith Anderson having decided
to discard “The Green Hat” after only a
short run—eight nights following the season
of eight matinees which the management at
first considered was all Sydney would stand
of a play that has won scant approval in
Australia; The bright ballets in “Sunny”
will kick their legs about for the last time
in the Sydney Empire on Saturday week;
and the theatre will go into recess till “The
Student Prince” arrives a week later. The
production is & friend of other days, the
play “Old Heidelberg”—in which Nellie
Stewart was Ivathie —-in a musical-comedy
dressing.

“Madame Pompadour,” on the strength
of its quality, the charm of Beppie de Vries,
and the humor of Arthur Stigant, should have
a long reign at Sydney Her Majesty’s ; “Cradle
Snatchers” is still sending Palace audiences
home happy; and “The Ghost
Train” delivers its cargo of
thrills nightly at the Criterion.
“The Sheik” may be relied upon
to fill the St. James for the
three weeks before the arrival
of “Lady. Be Good!” and
although Frank Neil has some-
thing else ready, “Getting Ger-
tie’s Garter” is providing such
good sport at the Grand Opera
House that the change is being
deferred.

Friedman’s audiences at Syd-
ney Town Hall have grown
with his season. He seems to
invest the piano with orchestral
qualities, and the absence of the
gymnastics usually associated
with piano-playing makes his
performance more impressive.
His courtesy to late-comers and
interval-laggards is extraordi-
nary ; he nlays them to their
seats with soft snatches of
melody. His programmes have
sandwiched the best of Beetho-
ven, Gluck, Schumann and
Chopin with the moderns, and
when it comes to tickling the
ears pleasantly and soothing the
senses the ancients have it. To-
night is Sydney’s last oppor-
tunity for hearing this genius
of the piano. Brahms, Schu-
mann, Liszt and Rubenstein
will vary the modernists’ works, which will
include a couple of Friedman’s own com-
positions.
** * *
Efrem Zimbalist is due to fill the Sydney
Town Hall with melody and people on Sat-
urday next. The violinist had a remarkable
series of triumphs in Maoriland. which must
have been highly gratifying to New Concert
Tours Ltd. management.

Fuller’s audiences, always the most voci-
ferous in Sydney, roar a greeting to Amy
Rochelle which recalls the applause ac-
corded by a football crowd to a winning
goal. The lady with the tricky eyes and
the heavy, hard voice is a genuine favorite
with Sydney vaudevillites, who seem to adore
her voice most in its foghorn moments. Her
liveliness is undoubted; and, with Stiffy and
Mo still going strong, audiences appear to be
satisfied that they are getting very full value
for their money.

Some good comic pantomime is being pro-
vided this week at Sydney Tivoli by the Bri-
an ts, who give a wordless act which they call
“The Dream of the Moving Man.” The delight-
ful work of the silent performers matches that
of “The Jerry Builders.” A surprise return
of Lee White, with Clay Smith, enabled last
Saturday’s audience to show its appreciation
of an old favorite. Alexander Carr still

Art and Architecture in Sydney:—
A number of pleasant faces are smiling from
the walls of the Macquarie Galleries, Bligh-street.
They are the friends of Miss Agnes Goodsir, painted
with remarkable breadth and surety. The lady
artist has returned from a long stay in Paris; from
her studio there she successfully invaded the Royal
Academy and the Paris Salon. She paints with a
vivacious sympathy excellently displayed in the eyes
gleaming from the shadow of a hat in the admirable
“Portrait Study” (No. 40), “Modern Type in Latin
Quarter” (No. 1), and “Spanish Shawl” (No. 11) ;
but occasionally there is a coldness in the flesh
tones, and the “Girl in Chemise” (No. 10) is a
thin-legged specimen. A portrait of Count Leo L.
Tolstoi, son of the philosopher, is a study full of
character of a man not even a blind mother could
call handsome; but one feels that the artist’s “Miss
Ruth Putnam” would be a delightful person to
meet. There is fair work in almost all of the
oils, and something less in quality in the water-
colors ; seemingly Miss Goodsir needs human interest
in her pictures to shine at her best. The flower
studies are stodgy; but a big picture showing a
room reflected in a large mirror is clever work.
Something in the line of educational art is dis-
played in the exhibition of the Institute of Archi-
tects at the Education Department’s gallery; the
designs, some of them attractive as pictures, show
how man’s handiwork can be harmoniously blended
into the natural features of its surroundings, and a
mask of beauty put upon even the most prosaically
utilitarian things. An international character has
been given to this show, with the result that there
is rather much of it; but all of it is interesting,
even the German section, which is mainly devoted
to harsh practical efforts to solve the housing
problem by tenement dwellings. Sir Edwin Lutyens’s
design for the new Midland Bank and the Winchester
College Memorial by Sir Herbert Barker are two
good overseas contributions; but local work stands
out with a revelation that we have brains with
the capacity for making our cities dreams of beauty.

Miss Unlucky Starr, having failed to
stampede the town with a bad selection of
modern pieces, meagrely staged and presented
by a mediocre crowd of players, resurrected
dear old “East Lynne” in a fit of despera-
tion. On Saturday, when this Showman saw
it, there wasn’t a dry eye in the Princess’s,
but, with few exceptions, they were tears of
laughter. In fact, there were more giggles
over the death of Little Willie, the consump-
tive, than over the artless humors of police
constable Bullock ; and the marvellous wooden-
ness of Lord Mount Severn (Charles Law-
rence) provoked almost as many titters as
the genuine burlesque of Connie Carlyle, done
by the excellent Mildred Cottell. J. B. Rowe
(one-time of “The Best People”) struggled
manfully to stem the rising tide of gross
irreverence with a sober and austere render-
ing of Archi-bald, the unbelievably noble
lawyer, but his efforts were brought to
naught every time that Carl Lawson, as the
villainous Francis Levison, intruded his
stout frame and false moustaches into the
proceedings, or Desmond McMinn staggered
on disguised as George Lambert; and the
habit of all concerned, including Wilson, the
maid, of holding up the action with long
bhakspearean soliloquies left most of the
younger playgoers, used to modern realistic-
methods, gasping with astonishment.
Even on the commercial boards the plav-
goer seldom sees a comedy as difficult to
perform as “Little Mary,” or as competently
produced and played as Gregan McMahon
and the Melbourne Repertory produced and
played it at the King’s on Saturday, under
the auspices of Tait. With one exception,
a lady brought over from Sydney to fill a
local gap, the amateurs handled with a rare
and refreshing naturalness Barrie’s fragile
fantasy of the old Irish chemist who aspires
to cure the ills of the British nation by
restoring the stomachs of the old nobility.
The most glowing figure of the evening was
Moira Loney, the drug-mixer’s unsophisti-
cated daughter, done to the right degree of
sweet faith and hesitation by Joy Gwyn.
Charles Tobin appeared to contribute slices
of his own personality to Cecil, the peer’s
son who falls in love with Eleanor the
actress through having too much phosphate
of iron in his blood—she was brought tear-
fully to life by Mardi Dillon. Normau
Atkyns and the engaging Eardley Turner
drew a fetching joint caricature of the medi-
cal profession, and Terence Crisp disguised
Ins manly figure in the knickerbockers of the
Earl of Plumleigh but failed to dissemble
the maturity of his laugh. McMahon poured
all his art over the senile pharmacologist,
and W. H. Chandler, as the Earl of Carlton,
did his best to reconcile the audience to his
union with a girl apparently 40 years his
junior, but failed through no fault of his
own. The surefire Barrie whimsicalities
kept a crowded house continuously absorbed,
though the total impression, when all was
over at a quarter after 10, was as satisfying
as a dinner composed entirely of mdringues.

A garish painting of a damsel in a circus
qostume in front of Melbourne Majestic this
week advertises that the winner of a long-
forgotten beauty competition is on show with-
in, but the lack of popular excitement over
the event suggests that the vogue of these
alleged darlings of the nation is as brief as
that of summer flies. The wraith of Pauline
Frederick, in a social drama entitled “Jos-
selyn’s Wife,” is a second feature. Hoyt’s
is anticipating criticism by launching a
Better Movie Month. An item promised for
“LITTLE MARY,” AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Gregan McMahon as Terence Reilly.

"Slide, Kelly, Slide,” a baseball comedy, and
“An Affair of the Follies” are the present
pabulum.

Rich, who provides a remarkable exhibi-
tion of advanced decay, and Adair, who feeds
him with the raw material of jests, are the
best portions of Melbourne Tivoli’s present
show. Dick Henderson continues to mar his
popularity by throwing in a chestnut here
and there. The Pastelle ballet is a new
addition which well earns the small print
accorded it by the management in the advts.

“Rose Marie” is at His Majesty’s in Mel-
bourne; at the Royal “The Ringer” keeps
the ring; and the only change on Saturday
will be Heifetz and his fiddle at the Audi-
torium. Next Friday, however, Moscovitcli
will doff the dressing-gown of Mr. Meister
and assume the beard and piercing eye of
Svengali, moving across to the King’s on
Saturday. The Royal will thereupon pro-
ceed to consider “Frasquita” and Marie
Burke with a lighter heart. The AthenEeum
is still able to announce that it is scientific-
ally heated with boiling water and Zillah
Bateman.
Carter the Great continues to perform
marvels in bloodless surgery at Melbourne
Palace. The magician’s show has more
amusement value tuan any spiritualistic
seance this Showman has attended; and
though Evelyn Maxwell’s alleged thought-
reading may be unscientific, it, too, is highly
entertaining. Her peeps into the future are
made at so furious a pace that the young
bachelor who is told he will be a father in a
week hasn’t time even to raise a blush, much
less a protest.
** * *
A Melbourne art medley:—
The latest emotions from the brushes of John
Rowell, Louis McCubbin, W. B. Mclnnes, Percy
Reason, Charles Wheeler, A. E. Newbury, Harold
Herbert, E. W. Syme and other workers are on view
at the New Gallery. A Herbert water-color, showing
Balmoral Beach, Sydney, has a patch of wet sand
and equally wet sea which is in the nature of a
masterpiece. Mclnnes contributes two children who
are as usual on their best behavior. Wheeler’s land-
scapes are nicely felt. Newbury’s feet, which once
promised to take him far, have mounted the tread-
mill of a pretty style. Rowell has taken the
rather jaded Meldrum tradition and given it a bath
of exhilarating sunshine. McCubbin is becoming too
ponderous to be interesting.
The first production in Australia of Gil-
bert and Sullivan’s “Ruddigore” was wit-
nessed by a crowded house at Adelaide
Theatre Royal. It was James Hay’s first
attempt as a producer, and he rose to the
occasion nobly. Charles Walenn was the
hero, Robin Oakapple, really a baron of
the accursed Murgatroyd line, doomed to
commit one crime per day. Charles made
a capital juvenile lover, and his song “My
Boy, You Can Take It From Me” was one
of the hits of the piece. James Hay, as the
sailor, Richard Dauntless, foster brother of
Robin, was in good voice and footed it
featly. Strella Wilson scored in the r6le
of the village maiden Rose Maybud, left at
the workhouse as a baby with only a change
of linen and a book of etiquette, winning
special favor with her number, “If Some-
body There Chanced To Be.” John Ralston
was realistic as the bad Sir Despard Murga-
troyd. Winifred Williamson portrayed
Rose’s aunt, Dame Hannah, with a deal of
spirit. _ The frocking is early-Victorian.
At the Prince of Wales, strong men grope
for their handkerchiefs when, in “The World
Against Her,” Agnes Keogh is turned out
of her home into the snow in thin slippers
and a small shawl. George Cross plays
the husband who finally comes to realise
the lady’s worth ; Hilda Dorrington and Guy
Hastings are the good friend and the villain.
At the Majestic, the Deloraines give a won-
derful equilibrist act with some amazing
trapeze work; and the Bandbox Revue Com-
pany provides an amusing musical revue in
“The New Landlord.” At West’s, Lilian
Gish may be seen as Hester Prynne in “The
Scarlet Letter” and a beautiful old-world
setting. The Wondergraph features Thomas
Meighan in “The Canadian Pioneer,” a
screen version of Somerset Maugham’s “The
Land of Promise,” which portrays the
struggle of a young couple in a back coun-
try.
Adelaide Art shows :
Irene Acraman has been holding an exhibition of
water-color paintings at the Society of Arts Gallery
in North Terrace, Adelaide. It is four years since
her last show. The artist is at her best in the
many charming peeps of coastal scenery, Encounter
Bay and Normanville furnishing material for some
of her best sketches. Nearly all the landscapes show
good draughtsmanship and a delicate treatment of
light and shade; the portraiture does not make
quite the same appeal.
“Wigs”: The widely-boomed activities of
the New York police authorities in “cleaning-
up” the stage merely amuses Broadway. The
raids on the theatres took place amidst the
cheers, laughter and applause of mixed
crowds, with camera-men busy at every
vantage-point. A play called “The Virgin
Man” was the first to he raided. The cop.
in charge of the proceedings remarked
genially to the manager, “You’re in luck,
young fella.” For the piece was on its last
legs, and advertised to close down. Owing
to the publicity given to it next day the
run was announced to continue indefinitely.
Poverty
Point
COULDN’T POSSIBLY CROWD IT IN.
“Wouldn’t you just love these old costumes to come back into fashion?”
“My dear, I simply couldn’t afford it. My allowance will only run to a baby single-
seater.”
“McWhustler” : With reference to “Curtain
Raiser’s” remarks (B. 2/6/’27) on the func-
tions of criticism, a critic was recently asked
by a producer what he was going to say
about comedian So-and-so. “To tell you the
truth,” said the critic, “I didn’t think he
was worth a notice.” “My oath, he is.” the
entrepreneur said. “Give him Hell! He’s
due to renew his contract and lie’s asking
for an increase!”
“A.F.”: Phillips Film Productions,
Limited, of Sydney, will shortly have its
first effort on the market. The film is
based on a story by Steele Rudd, and to
secure the exterior scenes a company of 20
persons was sent to Murgon (Queensland).
Isaac Moore lent his Barambah station and
the. State Government permitted the producer
to make use of the aboriginals on the Bar-
ambah Settlement. The Phillips co. aims at
turning out six feature films p.a. Except
for Eva Novak, the casts will be entirely Aus-
tralian, and a small army of technicians,
scene painters, carpenters, propertymen and
electricians will be needed for each produc-
tion. That is one reason why the unions
should assist the Australian-film movement,
instead of trying to retard it, as at least
two of them have done.
“L. do R.” : Unlike Edith Crane, who origi-
nated the part a quarter of a century ago,
Byrl (or is it Bryl?) Walkley (or is it
Walkeley?) won’t require a “singer off”
when she does Trilby. She has a decent
warble of her own, though not quite up to
the novelist’s description. Even Melba never
had a voice like that.
“The Amateur Gent.” : Old hands on the
Barrier gave a special welcome to the G.
and S. Co. because of Strella, daughter of
Harry Wilson, one time engineer on the
Prop., and of the lass from the Burra whom
Harry married in Broken Hill. Strella’s
voice is better than ever and she has become
slimmer. Apropos, a waitress at the Soldiers’
Hostel asked a local jazz performer if he
knew any of the members of the co. “Why,
I know them all!” he said. “Gilbert and
Sullivan especially. Gilbert is staying at
the Grand and Sullivan is at the Masons.”
“Caul Boy”: During one of his earlier
visits to Australia, Carter “the Great,” who
keeps girls floating in the air at Melbourne
Palace without difficulty, had to stand by
and watch a child fall down four flights of
a spiral staircase at Lennon’s Hotel in Bris-
bane and break its neck at his feet. That
is the ironical jest Fate loves to play on stage
magicians.
“Trichord”: Some tactless worshipper of
Beethoven has published extracts from his
diary dealing with his female servants. What-
ever the cause, the ladies seem to be one
long procession of May Beattys in ‘No,
No, Nanette” —their slogan was “I’m leavin’.”
“April 17,” he writes, “the kitchen-maid
came. ” May 18: “Gave notice to the kitchen-
maid.” May 19: “The kitchen-maid left.”
July 1: “The new kitchen-maid came.” July
28 : “The kitchen-maid ran away in the even-
ing.” September 9 : “The girl entered ser-
vice.” October 22: “The girl left.” Decem-
ber 12 : “The kitchen-maid entered service.”
December 18: “The kitchen-maid left.” Poor
old Beet! No wonder, as I heard someone
say at a Paderewski recital lately. “He’s not
as bright as Mendelssohn, do you think?”
“Stellsby”: Claude Dampier, sometime
Fuller’s "professional idiot,” _ is making
London sit up. Says one critic: _ “Claude
Dampier is the drollest entertainer the
Colonies have yet produced. His vacuous
smile will become as famous as Cirock’s
chuckle.” I hope so. for Claude’s sake. Still,
when he struck Perth before the war he
was billed as an “English” comedian.
“Caul Boy”: An all-Australian picture
called “Environment” is to be projected at
Melbourne Palace. Among the actors will
be Beth Darvall and Hal Percy, now with
Moscovitch in “The Ringer,” and Phyllis
Best, the daughter of Knight Robert. An
Australian orchestra playing Australian airs
and native throats warbling indigenous songs
will accompany the thing. The projector
engaged was made in Australia, too. Vaughan
Marshall, of Advanced Films Pty., a Vic-
torian concern, is the producer. The co. is
offering £lOO for the best scenario by an
Australian on an Australian theme.
“T. R. H.”: “Phelps’s” note on “Trilby”
(B. 23/6/’27) reminds me of Dorothea
Baird (afterwards Mrs. H. B. Irving), the
original Trilby to Beerbolim Tree’s Sven-
gali. Dorothea was no great actress at any
time, but she looked the part, and her bare
feet and ankles were delightful. Bare ankles
were a novelty 30 years ago. Dorothea was
very friendly with E. T. Cook, then editor
of the London Daily News, and his influ-
ence was a powerful factor in her success.
She was never much good in any other part
—but she was Mrs. H. B. Irving!
“Cine Ma”: The old tin “school of arts”
with the slab roof, the white-anted piano and
the incomplete edition of the Encyclopcedia
Britannica in the library will soon be as
dead as the pterodactyl. A new movie house
shortly to be erected at Burnley (Vic.) is
to have an ancient Egyptian courtyard and
a facade colored in the vivid primary tints
affected by the defunct Gyppo kings. Inside,
the walls will be decorated to resemble a
hypostyle; there will be a gigantic pylon
inscribed with hieroglyphics that Rameses
could read; the British lion will be sup-
planted by Tut’s more fantastic beast and
the roof will be made to resemble the reflec-
tion of hot desert sands on a moony sky.
The local sheikhs will feel more at home.
“C. Raiser”: Marie Ney, mentioned as
having made a niche for herself in thought-
ful parts in London, was born Marie Fix.
Her father had a fame which was as worthily
earned, though not so international. He was
Wellington’s (M.L.) most popular chef.
“Lever de Rideau”: To-morrow (July 1)
Victoria’s new law compelling producers to
show 1000 feet of British and 1000 feet of
Australian film comes into force, and already
straws are showing how the wind will be
tempered to the poor Hollywooden lamb. One
manager announces that his full American
programme will be unrolled, and that the
compulsory quota will be run off as a pre-
lude or epilogue while his patrons are stamp-
ing to their seats. Unless something more is
done the Australian picture will become
merely a house-emptier such as is used in
continuous vaudeville shows in England.
There the first evening programme begins at
6.50. At 8.50 the management has to clear
the theatre for the second programme at
9 o’clock. So it introduces a dud comedian
or a frightful dancer, and if the audience
doesn’t evacuate the house those performers
get the sack.
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: Due here soon is the
muscular Louis Bennison, who, when he
was in Australia five years ago, was better
as a cowboy than as either the tempera-
mental musical star of “The Great Lover”
or the Italian sculptor in the play built on
a Cellini adventure. An American actress,
Margaret Lawrence, will help him to play
“Grounds for Divorce” and some other pieces.
She has risen quickly to prominence on the
U.S. stage since she joined it a dozen years
ago.
“Hamfat”: Sydney Tivoli, after making
recent tests with a portion of ? the pro-
gramme, has accepted the “revue” idea of
serving vaudeville; and the “Tivoli Follies ’
will shortly be introduced. There were
“Tivoli Follies” years ago, _of course, with
Vera Pearce, but the new idea is different.
Instead of the programme being broken dully
into segments by curtain-falls on each act,
the more solid acts will swim in a sea of
dancing girls and songs, one item dovetailing
another right through the two parts. Billie
Lockwood, Syd Beck and Herbert Browne
will take part, and Blackman, of Madame
Pompadour,” will produce the shows. Sus-
picion points to Harry Hilling, who was in
charge of Melbourne Tivoli publicity,_ and is
now both publicity man and manager in Syd-
ney, as being largely responsible.
“T.P.O’C.”: It is strange that the Wil-
liamson-Taits, who now control the Sydney
Tivoli, don’t find a better shop for vaude-
ville. The old playhouse is a source of
profanity to many patrons, owing to pillars
and other obstructions; and side patrons in
the d.c. miss a lot. The back stalls are
execrable, and the “gods” are as in Harry
Rickards’s day. A bigger and more •com-
fortable theatre would increase the box-omce
pressure, as the show is generally worth the
tariff.
“Santander”: “The Transit of enus,
showing the gyrations of a frivolous woman
around an innocuous A.D.C. in a desert set-
ting, is the newest thing at London Ambas-
sadors. Frank Harvey has a minor role,
but Nigel Playfair plays lead. And Playtair,
a man of many Shaw and Pinero parts, is
particular about his casts.
THE AUSTRALIAN COMEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Harrison Owen, the Australian playwright,
has scored a success in London with his comedy, ‘The
Happy Husband.’ ”
The Kangaroo threw out his chest,
His tail was pointing north.
“Trot out,” said he, “your very best;
Ay, bring your champions forth.
I’ll match ’em for you, one by one,
And equal those not quite outdone.
“A prima-donna, did you say,
Fit for the topmost place?
A dozen, sirs, I could display,
But one will prove my case.
Hear her? No, not in Melbourne now;
In London docs she make her bow.
“A painter? One whose eye undimmed
In some God-given light
Sees Beauty bare, and holds her limned
For lesser mortals’ sight!
Ay, he— No, not in Sydney town ;
In Paris does he find his crown.
“A dramatist whose biting pen
Etches the very earth,
The pomp and poverty of men,
Their weakness and their worth !
Eh? —No. not here did he make good;
New York, or was it Hollywood?”

CC W/"HY is it that a fife and drum corps
W reproduced on a Stromberg-Carlson
makes you want to march? Why are Strom-
berg-Carlson listeners impelled to beat time
when they tune in a “jazz” orchestra? Why
can a symphony move one as deeply through
a Stromberg-Carlson as when seated before
the actual musicians”?
What is this Stromberg-Carlson secret of
Realistic Reproduction?
The answer is simple, yet scientific. The
tones that make you feel in music—the tones
that are needed to give completeness to a
composition, are all included in Stromberg-
Carlson tonal range, from the shrilling fife
to the booming bass drum.
This comprehensive tonal performance is
made possible by audio transformers of
refined design; precision of workmanship;
and scientific “Total Shielding” of the coils

Care for your Skin!
KEEP AWAY WINTER’S ILLS
by using REXONA—
The Rapid Healer—
A Reliable Remedy
Winter winds play havoc with the s'kin. Chapped lips, rough
faces, chilblains, cracked and bleeding hands all result from
exposure to the wind and weather and cause an unnecessary
amount of suffering—unnecessary because Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, prevents just these discomforts by healing the injured skin
and protecting it from the evil influence of disease germs. A small
abrasion may become the germ-infected area that threatens
health itself. A timely use of Rexona prevents small injuries
from becoming painful, and its action is so prompt that Rexona
has made its name known all over Australia as the Rapid Healer.
The triangular pot, with its healing, soft, green ointment, should
be kept handy on the dressing-table, so that every member of the
family can have access to its wonderful healing power.

Where Hebron Sleeps.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM broken walls and crumbling keeps
The soft mist rides where Hebron sleeps
' On Judah’s highway winding white
By rock and rue and terraced height;
Where hoary olives, silver-grey,
Hold council through the grieving day
With leaves that whisper stories old
And garnered wisdom manifold.
Through gliding years they fondly heed
The earnest march of man and steed,
The rapture of the morning lark,
The hooting owl that wings the dark,
The message of the sandalled feet
That speeds the hoard of rye and wheat—
All bounty of the sun and rain
From tillage on the lowly plain.
In rustling syllables they tell
The secret of the holy well,
The fervid verse the pilgrim prayed
Deep in the solace of their shade,
The tears the maid forsaken wept,
The trust betrayed, the promise kept,
Martial advance and slow retreat,
The tides of conquest and defeat.
Grey hills,. that watch the swift years fly,
Reflect the moods of wind and sky,
Echo the thunder’s cannonade
Across the ways of stagnant trade,
Sorrow in veils of winter mist,
Rejoice in robes of amethyst
When spring proclaims her festive reign
And fragrant blossom wakes again.
Oh, hills of Hebron, scarred and sage,
Echoing chords of every age,
The pagan calls, the chapel chimes,
And tones of dead, forgotten times!
Your terraced walls have watched the plight
Of nomad tribe and Israelite,
Swart hosts of old prophetic years
And Moab’s broken battle-spears.
Through morning mists you echoed them
Thundering south from Bethlehem —
The Roman legions marching down
To rear white ramparts of renown,
And columns set in long array
On ancient Petra’s Appian Way;
The Saracenic tide of sin ;
The swarthy troops of Saladin.
Grey hills and olive branches old,
All steeped in wisdom manifold,
But yesterday you saw them ride
Out of the south with careless pride-
Tall horsemen from a land of light
Across deep seas of day and night,
Squandering mirth as up they strode
Over the broken Ilebron-road !
Their steel-shod hoofs like torrents fell
Cleaving the haze of Hebron’s spell.
Up from the lowly plain they sped,
The grey hills echoing back their tread,
Marking their hopes that scorned all fears,
With wisdom wrought of elder years—
Seeing them as in ages gone
Strange hosts they likewise gazed upon.
By crumbling wall and tower and steep
The grey old olives nod and sleep.
Heedless of wealth and power and pride,
Triumphant march or conquest ride,
Nor coveting the victor’s spoil,
Content with ample corn and oil,
A sage declares, with half-shut eyes,
"Fickle is peace and false her guise,
But Hebron’s ways are old and wise.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UPON the bright and sunny morning of
January 25, 1808, Mr. Richard Atkins,
Judge-Advocate of his Majesty’s Terri-
tory of New South Wales, woke up with a
headache, an ill-content liver, a boiled eye
and a most prodigious and Sahara-like
thirst.
In addition to these disturbing symptoms
there was present in his befuddled mental
processes that vague fear and apprehension
of something disagreeable impending that
occasionally even besets those whose habit
of life is clean and unblemished by excess.
When it looms vaguely in the early-morning
consciousness of such as do not eschew
sack, and live uncleanly, the problems of the
day are apt to present themselves con-
fusedly as almost insurmountable difficul-
ties pregnant with nightmare terrors and
misgivings.
It was so with Mr. Atkins this pleasant
summer morning, as he blinked painfully
at the glare of sunlight malevolently stream-
ing its way across the room in two brilliant,
narrow bands between the parted curtains
of his half-darkened windows, whilst he
sought to collect and classify the confusion
of facts and fancies surging in his drugged
intellect, which were tinged with the un-
happiest sense of coming calamity. What
it was did not readily explain itself to his
disordered intelligence. He groaned a little
as he swung his fat legs uncertainly off the
sofa, where he had been sleeping in the
dishevelled raiment of the day before, planted
liis stockinged feet upon the floor, and, with
his aching temples between his hands, sought
to realise what was the matter.
But the faculty of understanding held
aloof, and only dimly did he grasp the situa-
tion when he raised bleary eyes to the littered
table, where all that was mortal of a defunct
feast—untidy plates, empty bottles and
fragments of food—reminded him nauseat-
ingly of too much to eat and drink.
“God/” he muttered hoarsely, as lie rose
unsteadily to his feet. “Governor Bligh—-
hue—Geor’ Orossley—the six officers—John
Macarthur —and me! Oh, Hell and damna-
tion! What a pickle! What a damned
pickle! Heaven preserve, us!”
He moved unsteadily into the adjoining
bedroom, lifted the, water-jug to his cracked
lips, and drank deeply. Then he came back
to the disreputable table in the dining-
room, and examined the bottles with shaky
hand.
“A/i,/” he sighed gratefully, as he dis-
covered onn with something in it “Rum.
My God, I need it! A life-saver, by George!
Lord, what a stew I’m in!”
He filled a dirty tumbler, not even troub-
ling to rinse it clean of the heel-tap it
contained, and took a great gulp. He fin-
ished it in two more gulps, and poured him-
self out another. Then he sank into a
chair beside the table, and began to recover
his wits.
There was the most accursed trouble
brewing over this affair of that son of a
dog John Macarthur and his infernal
schooner Parramatta. Tremendous trouble!
How it was to end he did not know. And
that fuming, furious volcano of a man, Cap-
tain Bligh, the Governor—what was he go-
ing to do? Some devilish unpleasant thing,
without doubt —something raging, some-
thing drastic. Something infernally quarter-
deckish!
“Oh, ye’ve woke up, ’ave ’ee ! Ye stinkiu’
barrel, ye boozin’ sot! A nice sight
you be, drat ye! Ain’t ye nothin’ to do
to-day, a-settin’ there a-swillin’ rum at
eight o’clock i’ th’ marnin’? Gawd stiffen
ye, but ye’re a credick, a credick!”
Mrs. Fanny Twemlow, his Honor’s “house-
keeper,” stood in the doorway and looked
with disfavor upon the head of the judiciary
of New South Wales, her buxom bosom
heaving with indignation, and her coarse, red
lips pouting with annoyance. Mr. Atkins
made a deprecatory gesture with his fat
right hand, re-clutched his glass with it and
drained it to the dregs. He was wider awake
now, and the intolerable gibes of his woman
annoyed him.
“To the Devil with you, you hussy! Look
ye, Fanny, I’m in no proper mood to brook
your insults. I’ll return ye to the women’s
barracks if I have any of your confounded
impart’nense—Understand that, now, you
trollop. Leave me this instant, I say. I)—n
you !”
The lady merely poked out her tongue at
him.
“No, that ye won’t, ye fat lout! Blood
an’ bones, I knows too much for ye—that
I do. Come out in th’ yard, an’ I’ll pump
water on y’r fat head. ’Tis on’y that’ll do
ye any good. Me for tli’ barracks — -me! If
I go back to barracks, ’tis you'll go to gaol
in Sergeant-Major’s Row. So there, now!
’Tis Fanny Twemlow knows too much for
Mister Dick Atkins to be a-talkin’ th’ like
o’ that. An’ well ye know it, ye over-
growed louse, ye!”
The quarrel might have continued to its
usual conclusion in the abject retreat of
the Judge-Advocate had not a sudden knock-
ing on the front door resounded through the
house. Unsteadily his Honor rose to his
feet, his fishy eyes goggling with apprehen-
sion, and pointed a shaking forefinger to-
wards the door.
“Go, see who ’tis. Enough of your
accursed tongue, woman. See who’s there,
and tell’ em I’m not at home. Say I’ve
gone for a ride — anything!” he whispered
hoarsely.
The woman scowled at him, and went out
into the hall.
“Mr. Atkins—l must see his Honor. Busi-
ness of the utmost importance, my good
woman. Be pleased to tell your master
’tis Mr. George Crossley, from his Excel-
lency. Most important business—will not
brook a moment’s delay. Come, now, take
my name in to him, do.”
Mr. Atkins recognised the half-wlieedling,
half-bullying tones of the possessor of the
best legal brain in Sydney—the ticket-of-
leave attorney, transported for perjury, who
was his mainstay and buckler in all matters
relating to the laws of England, of which
the Judge-Advocate was supremely and
extraordinarily ignorant.
“Oh,” he called out, “come in, my dear
George, come in. Egad, there’s no one I
was more desirous of seeing! Show the
gentleman in, Mrs. Twemlow.” He retreated
into the bedroom. “Take a seat,. George.
I’ll be with you in a minute or two. I’m
not quite dressed. Pray, take a seat.”
“Him ! Huh !” grunted Mrs. Fanny Twem-
low, as she retired to the kitchen.
* * * *
A little later in the morning there met
together at Government House three gentle-
men who cordially detested one another. The
Judge-Advocate could detest and dislike any-
one who summoned him early from bed
after a previous night, and Mr. Crossley
habitually detested too obvious honesty of
purpose; but his Excellency Captain William
Bligh, R.N., Captain-General and Governor-
in-Chief in and over his Majesty’s Territory
of New South Wales, had a detestation of
both of the gentlemen whom he had sum-
moned to this conference —a detestation that
was positively venomous. His need of them
was sore, but he found it utterly impossible
to be civil to them. He walked up and
down the floor of the drawing-room at Gov-
ernment House, glaring and snarling at
them, as they sat upon the edges of their
chairs, contemplating the raging sailor with
dismay, and wishing themselves anywhere
but where they were.
Richard Atkins we have sufficiently seen
to be able to gather some inkling of the sort
of man he was. Governor Bligh knew him
to be nothing other than a drunken, muddle-
headed incompetent, of no morals and dubi-
ous honesty. But in the crisis that con-
fronted him the Judge-Advocate, unfortu-
nately, could not be done without. He was
entirely ignorant of his duties, and nobody
in the settlement had the slightest regard
or respect for him; but he was the distracted
colony’s Chief Justice, its promulgator of
precedent, its enuneiator of decrees, and
could not be dispensed with, so far as his
presence on the Bench and his signature to
legal documents were concerned. He was
an unfortunate necessity.
And his Excellency knew well the story
that accounted for George Crossley’s pres-
ence in Sydney—the diverting tale of how
he. had placed a pen in a recentlv-dead man’s
hand and a fly in his mouth, and had guided
the corpse’s hand in forming the letters of
his signature to a will, and had subsequently
sworn in court that the testator had life in
him when he executed the document dis-
posing of his worldly affairs. But there was
nobody else available to whom Bligh could
turn for the simplest legal advice—the only
law lie knew himself was contained in the
Articles of War and the Mutiny Act.
“Damme, Mr. Atkins,” he was bellowing,
“what’s it got to do with me whether you
owe Macarthur £5 or £500? What the devil

do I care about your private affairs, or his?
’Tis none o’ my business. But ’tis my busi-
ness to see that you discharge the duties of
your office —and, by God, I’ll take care that
ye do. Lookye now, ye’re so infernally
drunk, at nine o’clock in the morning, that
.ye can hardly d —d well sit up! But ye’ll
preside over this wretched Court that meets
at ten, and I’d see that ye did so were ye
at the point of death. I know well ye’re
no use on the Bench, but without you the
Court can’t be constituted; so ye’ll be on
the Bench, if ye have to be carried thither,
and held up in your seat. By Heavens, ye
will! Mr. Crossley’s informed us the Court
cannot be a Court without ye, so ye’ll
go straight from here and preside over
it.”
“But —but, your Excellency,” mumbled the
Judge-Advocate, pawing his slack mouth with
uncertain lingers, “I—l don’t think—that
is to say, I’m afraid the six officers will
refuse to sit with me. Scurvy rascals, your
Excellency—but that’s what they'll do. In-
deed, ’tis—’tis a very unfortunate business.”
“Unfortunate be d —d!” exploded Bligli.
“It will be unfortunate for them if they
don’t. I’ll not stand their damnable impu-
dence. They will be compelled to constitute
a court, just as you, the Judge-Advocate,
will be compelled to preside over it. Let
me tell you that, Mr. Atkins. I’ll have none
o’ their nonsense —damme if I shall. Cross-
ley, here, says I can proceed against ’em
on a charge of treason if they refuse to
act, and I’ll do so. They’ll not get to wind-
ward of me ! You be off to the court-house
—’tis getting on for ten o’clock —and see
you do your duty. I’ll take no excuses.
The Act says no criminal court can be con-
vened without the Judge-Advocate, or sit
without him. You say that’s correct, Cross-
ley?”
“Perfectly correct, your Excellency,” agreed
Mr. Crossley obsequiously. “The Judge-
Advocate is appointed by natcnt, and may
not be dispensed with, your Excellency.”
“Very well, then. Let me hear no more
of this nonsense. You’ll make your finding
in accordance with the evidence, and I’ll
see ’tis confirmed. That’s all there is about
it. Go about your business, sir. Mr. Cross-
ley. I have somethin o ' further to consult
with you about. Good morning, Mr. Atkins.
Oh, dammit, man, tell my stewand to give
ye a nobbier, as you go out. God knows
you look as if you need it! But only one,
mind ye—only one!”
Mournfully and shakily, his Honor rose
to his feet, and moved towards the door,
turning to bow totteringly to the Governor
ere he groped half-blindly through it. Bligh
watched him go, with disgust plain in his
face. Mr. Crossley grinned deprecatingly.
But lie knew better than to make any com-
ment. Bligh turned to him as the door
closed.
“And now, Crossley, about these d—d six
officers —sink their souls!”
# -f ® $
Mr. Atkins sat in the twilight drinking
rum, and in much distress. He had sent
the amiable Mrs. Twemlow out into the
night to study how the world of Sydney
wagged, and to procure more rum—for there
was grave danger of a shortage in the Judge-
Advocate’s establishment, many refreshers
having depleted his stock during an anxious
and harrowing day. He had forbidden her
to light the candles in the dining-room, being
fearfully undesirous of attracting to himself
any attention from the riotous elements
abroad in Sydney that evening, so that his
cottage lay in darkness, and he had only
sufficient light to make connection between
bottle and glass from a dim illumination
supplied by half a moon that only sufficed
to make darkness not quite visible, as he
sat by the table in fear and trembling.
It was the evening of the 26th of January
—the twentieth anniversary of the founda-
tion of the colony—and, from the ominous
sounds that drifted up to his cottage on
the lower slopes of the Rocks from the
valley of the Tank Stream, he judged rightly
that Sydney was in a state of disquieting
unrest. Loud shoutings and songs of a ribald
sort disturbed the usual tranquillity of the
early evening, and the glare from the bon-
fires lighted at the corners of the principal
thoroughfares—probably at the orders of the
rebel officers of the Corps—made a flickering
shine through the open windows. He was
very apprehensive of serious disturbances,
and did not know what to do. In fact, he
had decided that it would depend on Mrs.
Fanny’s report whether or not lie sought
refuge upon some vessel in the harbor, or
fled into the country beyond the Brickfields.
Extraordinary and terrible things had hap-
pened during the day—most disconcerting
things. Yesterday the six officers summoned
to form the Court for the trial of Mr. Mac-
arthur had upheld his protest against
Atkins’s presidency of it, and the Judge-
Advocate had adjourned the Court. But the
Court had refused to be adjourned, and had
carried on without him, and released Mac-
arthur from custody. The Governor had
called on Major Johnston to come into Syd-
ney from his place at Annandale and confer
with him as to laying a charge of treason,
or mutiny, against the six officers, and the
Major had excused himself on the ground
of ill-health. But he had come into some
purpose to-day—the Governor had been
arrested and deposed, and God only knew
what was happening! There were rumors
of all sorts.
Atkins was very upset, and uncertain
what to do. Why the devil didn’t that bag-
gage of a woman come back? This suspense
was intolerable. He helped himself, tremb-
lingly, to more rum, and as he did so heard
Mrs. Fanny laughing at the gate in the little
picket-fence surrounding his untidy garden.
She had evidently been drinking. He felt
indignant with her. It Avas wrong of her
to indulge during such anxious times. He
would send her about her business.
“Ho, ye lousy, fat tub,” shouted the gentle
lady as she came in the door. “Settin’ alone
i th’ dark, are ye? Frightened for to show
a glim, I’ll go bail. Pshaw! ye fat coward,
let’s have a look at ye. I’m done wi’ ye,
I am. Ye can go to Hell, Dicky. I’m
a-goin’ to take on wi’ a better man. Where’s
that tinder-box?”
Muttering curses upon her master, the
“housekeeper” at length succeeded in light-
ing a candle, and held it aloft to inspect
him, a contemptuous leer in her sensual, red
face.
“I got a frien’ outside,” she said, thickly.
“A goo’ boy ’e is. A sojer—a brave sojer.
Norra stinkin’ tub like you, Dick Atkins.
Could eat you, Jem could.”
“Tell me, woman, what’s toward? > What’s
happening in the town? Is it safe for me
to remain here?”
“Don’ matter about you, Dicky. Nobody
cares ’bout you now. Out of a job, you
are. Don’ count ’tall.”
She stepped up to him, and caught him
a smack across the fat jowl with her open
hand.
“There!” she shouted. “That’s for you
-—an’ it’s long been owing. Here, Jem”—
she raised her voice louder —-"Wine iii hel-e;
Here’s this —- fool insultin’ Of me. Come
on in here, ail’ help me turn him out. He
don’ count no longer-. I’m done wi’ him,
I am. Come Oh ill, an’ we’ll teach him.” .
“Ali’m a-coomin’, lass. Ah’ll lam ’im.
We Won’t stand none o’ ’is nonsense. No,
that we won’t. Ah’m a-coomin’.”
His Honor started up in alarm as an
immense soldier appeared in the doorway—
one whom he immediately recognised as hav-
ing the reputation of being the very worst
of the rank and file in that collection of
King’s bad bargains, the New South Wales
Corps. The fame of Private Andrew Pol-
warne was well known to his Honor the
Judge-Advocate. His Honor had himself
dealt with him, and somewhat harshly, as
he trembled to recall. Now he was very
drunk indeed, very bellicose, and very much
disposed to make short work of such a rival
in the affections of the gentle Fanny as lie
saw huddled up fearfully before him in his
armchair on the other side of the table.
“Eat him up, Jem!” screamed the lady,
as the big soldier stood gaping down at the
fat and fearful object before him. “Eat
him up. He done you dirty, once. Now’s
y’ time, laddie, now’s y’ time!”
“Hie!” gurgled Private Polwarne. “Now’sh
me time, by Gawd! Now’sh me time!”
Whereupon the huge soldier made to ad-
vance upon his Honor, but by the blessing
of Bacchus stumbled over a chair, measured
his length upon the carpet, and was unable
to rise. So, making the best of a bad job,
he sang a version of “The British Grena-
diers” —-the inspiring air that had played
his battalion into action in the afternoon,
when it crossed the Tank Stream and sur-
rounded Government House. With haste
and precipitancy, his Honor fled through
the open door into the night.
Dawn came at last and found his Honor
shivering wearily under the uncompleted
walls of Fort Phillip, up on Flagstaff Hill.
Over the far barrier of distant South Head,
stretching like a grey wall between the wide,
steely waters of the harbor and the yellow-
ing sky, the coming sun sent a warm glow
up into the zenith, and all the loveliness
of Port Jackson lay revealed at his feet.
He sat upon a rock, and gazed disconsolately
down at the little village in the hollow,
reflecting miserably and soberly—he was
more sober than he had been for months'—
upon the mutability of human affairs. Yester-
day morning, though physically distressed,
as he remembered, by the effect of the previ-
ous night’s potations, he had been of some
consequence in the settlement. Now what
was he? An "outcast, a refugee, a homeless
wanderer who had to shun his fellows lest
they inflict upon him such violence and
indignity as he had so narrowly escaped last
evening! And lie was Richard Atkins,
Esquire, Judge-Advocate of his Majesty’s
Territory of New South Wales! Truly
the ways of Fate were beyond man’s under-
standing. Shudderingly he thought of the
not-so-distant French Revolution. Would he
also be a bloody sacrifice to radical unrest?
These and a score of other unhappy
thoughts he cogitated dolefully whilst the
sun came up, and the glorious spectacle of
land and water below him became bathed
in glowing radiance. He was infinitely
wretched; he was miserably fearful of what
was to happen, when the town woke up.
Already, from one or two chimneys, the
little thatched, pipeclayed cots that were the
main architectural features of Sydney were
sending up blue spirals of smoke into the
blueness of the sky. Dogs were barking
as doors were opened. From the Barracks
—where his enemies were—the clear notes
of Reveille echoed down the valley and across
the harbor. From behind a bush near by
a blear-eyed man was roused by the bugle-
call, and stood contemplating sleepily the stout
and miserable personage seated upon the rock.
With a shudder the Judge-Advocate recog-
nised the hangman. And he saw that the
hangman recognised him.
The evil-looking fellow lurched across; to
him, and slowly drew a black bottle from
the inside pocket of his fustian jacket. He
proffered it to Mr. Atkins.
“Drink ’earty, y’r Honor,” he said, in a
kindly fashion. “Ye looks cold, that ’ee
do, an’ a soop’ll do ’ee good. I know y’r
Honor’s lost y’r job; but never say die.
Take a long pull ; things’ll seem better arter-
wards, that they will. I’m so.rry for y'r
Honor —many’s th’ bit o’ bus’ness ye’ve put
in rny ’amis. But it’s a long drop that
ain’t got no end. Them fellers i’ th’ Corps
won’t stan’ in need o’ my sarvices, so be
as they’s give enough rope for to ’ang their-
selves, that they won’t. Drink ’earty, y’r
Honor, drink ’earty.”
With fervent gratitude his Honor drank
heartily.

A curved red gum-leaf, wet with dew:
And “See,” said she, “how my colors blow
Gay. defiant, so men may know
That undefeated and proud I pass.
With my fading flowers and my withered

Death is king, but his reign is brief,
For by the curve of this crimson leaf _
I give you my message, clear and plain:
I go, but I shall return again.”

■ II Aforo.7 MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASCU.
, The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tehnis, and bnwling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c.
it is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “Atco,” thanks to the scientific precision of its con-
struction, is remarkably low. Ah operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
With the object of making this ALL-BRITISH MOWER more popular on
the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
prices. Firil stocks on hand.
PRICES:—I4in'. ‘ cutters, £47/10/-; 16in., £57/10/-; 18in.,
£67/10/-; 22m., £B2/10/-; 24in., £93/10/-; 30in., £llO each.

Fellow Art Unionists! I’ve come back! Three months ago I started off scratch to search
for gold to buy the Prizes in the Firemen’s Art Union for the Hospitals and Ambulances. After
days of travelling I neared the Bay of Dogs, and with one bound I landed in New Guinea, where I
rocked the cradle for two months. I’m here again, loaded up with prizes for the Lucky Dog that
looks me in the Green Eye. My Slogan is: “A Ticket in the Art Union is worth Six in the Tram.”
Every Pocket has a silver lining. Try your luck, and turn the lining into gold. Remember me!
