AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eument o
Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent abnormal
fermentation of the food, thus allowing the
natural digestive ferments to act, and if
taken regularly-after meals they so improve
the digestion that a strict diet becomes
unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes
are most useful to those who suffer from
Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

presenting as a reality what is only an
appearance. .. .But movement and rhythm
are realities, not appearances. When I pre-
sent rhythm and movement I’ve done some-
thing. I’ve made reality appear.”
jt
Then comes the war to snatch from this
jealous mother the last of her children’s in-
terests. Nicholas, whose picture _as a boy
is done in the most 'charming vein of May
Sinclair’s art, enlists —and is killed. Michael,
who fiercely disapproved of the herd-soul
that would submerge his own individuality,
desperately goes on writing poetry ; but the
death of his younger brother is more than
argument, and he, too is drawn into the
vortex.
This many-sided book ends on a mystical
note. Nicholas writes home from the Front
trying to tell his mother what meeting death
in a charge is like: “When you’re up first
out of the trench and stand alone on the
parapet it’s absolute happiness. And the
charge is—well, it’s simply heaven.” Dis-
missing the theories that this exaltation is
a form of sex-madness, or simply submerged
savagery bobbing up to the top—a hidden
memory of having killed, or that there’s
nothing in it but a “ration of rum,” Nicholas
points out that these theories make the exal-
tation depend upon killing ; and not on your
chance of being killed. “You’re bang up
against reality—you’re going clean into it—
and the sense of it’s exquisite.”
And after Nicholas’s death Michael experi-
ences the same ecstasy: “It is absolutely
real. I mean it has to do with absolute
reality. With God. It hasn’t anything to
do with having courage or not having
courage It isn’t excitement; you’re not
excited. It isn’t a tingling of, your nerves ;
they don’t tingle. It’s all curiously quiet
and steady.. . .Your body and your nerves
aren’t in it at all. Your body may be moving
violently, with other bodies moving violently
around it, but you’ve still. But suppose it
is. your nerves. Why should they tingle at
just that particular moment, the moment
that makes animals afraid? Why should
you be so extraordinarily happy? Why
should the moment of extreme danger be
always the ‘exquisite’ moment? Why not
the moment of safety?
“Doesn’t it look as if danger were the point
of contact with reality, and death the closest
point? You’re through. Actually you lay
hold on eternal life, and you know it.
Another thing—it always comes with that
little shock of recognition. It’s happened
before You get the same ecstasy, the
same shock of recognition and the same
utter satisfaction when you see a beautiful
thing
“It’s odd to have gone all your life trying
to get reality, trying to get new beauty,
trying to get utter satisfaction, to have
funked coming out here because you thought
it was all obscene ugliness and waste and
frustration, and then to come out and to find
what you wanted.”
May Sinclair, losing a little of her earlier
brilliancy, has gained solidity and poise.
The Tree of Heaven is a modern novel,
weighty, various, complete.
May Sinclair
In her latest novel, The Tree of Heaven
(Cassell, per Dymock’s Library), May
Sinclair is preoccupied with Motherhood and
what the world —and, ultimately, the war—
will do with it We meet Frances, a happy
wife and mother, at the age of 33, safely
immured in a world where nothing ever hap-
pened, where “things did not change; they
endured; they went on.” Her picture of
England’s Parliament and of her imperial
policy was, of course, her husband’s; and it
ran like this: “There would just be more
speeches and more strikes, and still more
speeches, going on for ever and ever at
home; while foreign affairs and the British
Empire went on for ever and ever too, with
no connection between the . two lines of
sequence.” And being so profoundly happy,
Frances didn’t want anything to change. But
the world nagged at her. Children have the
annoying habit of growing up.
“For the awful thing about your children
was that they were always dying. Yes,
dying. The baby Nicky was dead. The
child Dorothy was dead and in her place
was a strange big girl. The child Michael
was dead and in his place was a strange big
boy. And Frances mourned over the passing
of each age. You could no more bring back
that unique loveliness of two years old, of
live years old, of seven, than you could bring
back the dead. .. .She did not yet know that
the mother of babies and the mother of boys
and girls must die if the mother of men
and women is to be born.”
The children grow up, Life sweeps them
away from their mother; they are caught up
into the vortex of life. Dorothy is swept
away into the Feminist vortex; but she
wears her Suffragette colors with a differ-
ence. And Michael becomes a poet, and
Nicholas comes a cropper and marries the
wrong woman. And the mother hides her
fea/rs and has to stand idly by and let the
world and the war do their worst to her
brood.
May Sinclair has evidently studied the
Suffragette soul: she draws a remarkable
picture of that quaint historical outbreak of
the feminine herd-soul. Dorothy is sent to
gaol after a raid, and on her release attends
with her fellow-prisoners a reception by the
Woman’s Franchise Union. As Dorothy and
the others entered, the audience cheered them.
“From the 350 there went up a strange, a
savage and a piercing collective sound,
where a clear tinkling as of glass or thin
metal, and a tearing as of silk, and a crying
as of children and of small, slender-throated
animals were held together by ringing, vibrat-
ing, overtopping tones as of violins played
in the treble. And now a woman’s voice
started off on its own note and tore the
delicate tissue of this sound with a solitary
scream; and now a man’s voice filled up a
pause in the shrill hurrahing with a solitary
boom That collective sound was fright-
ful.”
Michael, of course, becomes a Futurist
poet; and May Sinclair obliges with a bril-
liant exposition of the aims of the Futurist
in art : “Futurist art is simply art that has
gone on, that has left off being static and
become dynamic. It expresses movement,
because it presents objects directly as cutting
across many planes. To do this you have to
break up objects into the lines and masses
that compose them, and project those lines
and masses into space on any curve, at any
angle, according to the planes you mean
them to cross, otherwise the movements you
mean them to express. The more planes in-
tersected the more movement you get. By
decomposing figures you compose movements.
By decomposing groups of figures you com-
pose groups of movements. Nothing but a
cinema can represent objects as intact and
as at the same time moving; and even the
cinema only does this by a series of decom-
positions so minute as to escape the eye.
“You want to draw a battle-piece or the
traffic at Hyde Park corner. It can’t be
done unless you break up your objects. You
want to carve figures in the round, wrestling
or dancing. It can’t be done unless you dis-
locate their lines and masses, so as to throw
them all at once into those planes that the
intact body could only have traversed one
after another in a given time. By taking
time into account as well as space we pro-
duce rhythm. The Dancing Faun and the
Frieze of the Parthenon do not express
movements; they express movements arrested
at a certain point.... Arrested motion is a
contradiction in terms Your medium
limits you. You have to choose between the
intact body which is stationary and the
broken and projected bodies which are in
movement. That is why we destroy or sup-
press symmetry in the figure and in design.
Because symmetry is perfect balance which
is immobility.
“If I draw a perfect likeness of a fat,
pink woman, I’ve got a fat, pink woman
and nothing else but a fat, pink woman.
And a fat. pink woman is a work of Nature,
not a work of art. And I’m lying. I’m
Of Interest to Obituary Bards
The saddest thing about this war is not
the death of Billjim, but his obituary notice
in the morning papers. He deserves his
country’s remembrance and his widow’s or
his girl’s tears, but not the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald’s doggerel. Billjim dies for his
country, and all he wins is a wooden cross
in France and this hackneyed epitaph :
In a soldiei s grave he is lying,
Somewhere in France he fell;
Words cannot tell the loss
Of the
(father
husband
son I
brother
mate
loved so well.
Or his mourning friends are told: —
His fresh young life could not be saved;
He slumbers now in a peaceful grave.
Every issue of the morning press contains
rimes of an equally deplorable quality.
Somehow, as a correspondent remarks,
these poor tributes do scant justice to the
man and the occasion, and they fail—-at
least, it is to be hoped they fail—to reflect
the true feelings of those who pay for their
insertion. But the morning press has no
concern either for the dignity of its “Roll
of Honor” or the slight it allows inarticulate
love and grief to put upon a dead hero.
Occasionally, it is true, the mourner adds
an epitaph that is beautiful and appropriate.
From the too-long daily columns of deaths,
degraded by blatant doggerel, one can some-
times pick simple inscriptions like these:—
He fell—open-eyed and unafraid.
Greater love hath no man than this.
He died as he lived —a man.
He played the game.
A young life nobly ended.
And sometimes we get an authentic personal
touch, though seldom adequately expressed:
While the stars were shining overhead,
Five brave and loyal lads were carried by their
soldier mates
To rest in peace, they said.
Not only there lie sleeping the mates whom they have
But the’ hearts of women weeping are buried neath
_ the cross.
And it must be confessed that the “Roll of
Honor” epitaphs seldom sink to the level of
the usual “In Memoriam” efforts. Appar-
ently once a year every dead mother in
N.S.W. arises and, per The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, thus lectures her offspring from
the grave:—
A mother’s love is a blessing:
Never treat it with scorn ;
Cherish her while she is living,
For you will miss her when she is gone ( V gorn).
Heed her when you are in childhood,
For when she is old and grey
You will never know her value
Till she is lying beneath the clay.
Having got that off her chest, at a shilling a
line, each aged mother gets back to the clay
for another 12 months. Probably it is to
disarm any suspicions that the clayed de-
ceased might justifiably harbor that on the
anniversary of her death her children assure
her—and their neighbors—publicly that they
are mourning her privately :
We mourn for you in silence, mother,
But not with outward show;
For the heart that mourns sincerely
Mourns silently and low.
But the grievances of mothers beneath the
clay and children who mourn without the
assistance of brass bands are, after all. pri-
vate concerns. The epitaph of Billjim
is, or should be, a public duty. This page
hereby disclaims any desire to raise the
literary tone of the “Roll of Honor” columns
of the morning press; it is not in the inter-
ests of the Epitaph Department of the
Herald and Telegraph that it feels im-
pelled to intervene; but Billjim deserves a
nobler send-off. It isn’t as if the morning
press published these puerile but pathetic
tributes to our heroic dead free; —though
there seems no reason why the morning press
shouldn’t. Consider: Billjim has given his
life for his country, for the ci’owd that buy
the newspapers ; his name is printed free in
the casualty list; but not in the “Roll of
Honor.” To get into that nobly-named
department costs the next-of-kin a shilling
per line, “poetry extra”—also at a shilling
a line. That is an excellent rate for poetry;
it is a remarkable rate for doggerel; but the
Herald doesn’t pay that rate; it charges it.
Otherwise there would be good times ahead
for the Epitaph Bards and Obsequies Laure-
ates Trades Union. The Epitaph Depart-
ment does not discriminate between good and
bad poetry: there is a flat rate for every-
thing, even when it doesn’t rime. And,
frankly, the poetry that the Herald prints
isn’t worth a shilling a yard.
Here, then, is the job for our Obituary
Bards. Let us write Billjim the epitaph ne
deserves. It must be brief, for the Herald
charges a shilling a line for grief. But it
can be nobly expressed for four or six shil-
lings. Half a guinea will be paid by this
page for the best epitaph for Billjim re-
ceived by April 27.

Anzalian
The Bishop of Willochra, Gilbert White,
writes Round About the Torres Straits, a
record of Australian Church Missions
(S.P.C.K., London. 25.). Th; history is
given of the Yarrabah, Forrest River, Mit-
chell River, Roper River, Moa, and the Nerw
Guinea Missions. “I have always felt that
the aboriginal was the Lazarus of Australia.
Poor, ragged and sick with the sores which
are the result of contact with the diseases of
the white man, hungry because he has been
driven from the, waterholes, where alone he
can obtain food, in order that the cattle may
not be disturbed, unable to defend himself
against the wrongs which may be inflicted
upon him, he lies at the gate of Australia,
so rich, so comfortable and so well fed. It
is largely due to the real if tardy efforts
of the Church that the nation is slowly
awaking to its duties and responsibilities in
the matter.”
Henry Tate in Australian Musical
Resources (Endacott, Melb.) suggests “a
possible starting-point for a constructive
school of Australian creative music.” His
scheme includes a- “deflected scale” based on
the ordinary major scale, and “figure and
melody developed from Australian bird
calls.” His essay, which is admirably illus-
trated with passages from the composer’s
works, has been put forth only for whatever
suggestive value it may possess. “Our com-
posers may find in its point of view or in its
specific ideas a suggestion which will lead in
the direction of distinctively Australian
work.” An admirable ideal. Our composers
should be interested.
A copy of The Yandoo, a Billjim dug-out
paper, illustrated and printed by a type-
writer, has reached this page. What or why
a Yandoo js we don’t know ; but we’re glad
to make its acquaintance. Evidently the
censorship forbids The Yandoo mentioning
its place of residence or the number of its.
brigade. It is full of Billjim wisdom and
dug-out wit.

Dr. F. Truby King, of M.L., is the author of a
valuable common-sense book, The Story of the Teeth
(Whitcombe and Tombs, M.D. ; Bd.), packed with
good advice. His conclusions may thus be briefly
summed: Much of the harm done to our teeth is
worked before birth, owing to the mother not taking
sufficient care of her health; the baby when born
“m <st work for his living"’; he must be breast-fed;
he must not be allowed to let his liquid food drain
down his mouth —suckling is hard work, meant by
Nature to be hard work ; if the baby must be bottle-
fed, it must be made to suck through the smallest
teat, and the bottle must be pulled by the mother to
stimulate tugging and activity; from six months
onwards the baby must be gradually habituated to
munching and chewing, given a bare bone, tough
crusts, etc., instead of being pap-fed ; “feeding exer-
cise is the most primitive, fundamental and essential
of all forms of exercise” ; soft foods must be avoided
as much as possible. Finally, the author justly
insists upon the preservation of the teeth *as a
national duty.
“Wait”: While the Red Page lias been
collecting fairy-tales for the Australian kid,
apparently the Yankee kids of fairy-tale age
write their own poetry. Here are a few
samples taken from the Chicago rnagazine,.
Poetry:—
THE FORFEIT.
She was holding up the big green leaf
Over my head, and she said,
‘‘Heavy, heavy hangs over thy head.
What shall the owner do to redeem it?”
"Climb up the world
And bring me down the moon.”
The moon was a white lily bud
That hadn't grown to a flower yet.
When she picked it
All the little raindrops flew off
And made stars.
Betty Orr (5 years old).
GREY MORNING.
The grey-faced sky lets me look at it,
And the timid rain upon my face
Is softer than sunshine:
Some people are like this gentle morning.
Elmond Franklin McNaugiit (8 years old)..
WATER.
The ’world turns softly
Not to spill its lakes and rivers.
The water is held in its arms,
And the sky is held in the vyater.
What is water,
That pours silver
And can hold the sky?
Hilda Conkling (6 years old)'
TO A SPARKLING PIECE OF CRYSTAL.
0 thou white and yellow stone,
How dost thou make thy nest and breed thy
young, in a rock?
Art thou brother of the ruby red,
Which is more like Mars than the Pleiades seven
That sit in the heavens high,
Or the t.ailish comet that circles the sky ?
O thou crystal bright as Venus
Shining in the twilight grey!
Frank. M. Schoonmaicer
(who is a comparative Methuselah of 10 years old).
You will notice that they are all up-to-date
enough to write in vers libre.
Many suggestions for renaming our birds
have arrived in response to our request
(R.P. 14/2/’18). These will later be sub-
mitted to a committee of birdologists and bird-
hards. Meantime, as a specimen of the sort
of suggestions we need, this charming letter
from Dunedoo is printed :
I hope some name may be found for the
cuckoo-shrike other than summer-bird. That
is the name by which the white-browed
wood-swallows are universally known in
this district. Our own children (aged four
and three years) named the regent honey-
eaters “The Beauty Birds.” It is a genuine
child’s name, but you may consider it too
babyish! I send it in case no better names
are suggested.
The following names are those we prefer
to use to the scientific terms for the birds we
know best: —•
Australian Brown Flycatcher: Jacky Winter.
White-shouldered Caterpillar Eater: Peter I Peter!
Spotted Ground Dove: Doo Poo.
White-fronted Chats: Little Nuns.
Pardelotes: Witty Dicks.
Bell Magpies: Currawongs.
Regent Honeyeaters: Beauty Birds.
A jury of 50 representative American-
critics selected the best books of 1917. The
voting naturally shows a bias towards Ameri-
can books. Thus, The Life and Letters of
E. E. Hale (an American bloke) received
the greatest number of votes! The voting
in fiction was remarkably light, and again an
American novel topped the poll, His Family,
by Ernest Poole—certainly the best Ameri-
can novel of the year. Kipling’s A Diversity
of Creatures followed, then The Banks of
Colne (Phillpotts), and Christine (Alice
Cholmondeley). The second and. third most
important books were also biographical,
Mark Twain’s Letters and Morley’s Recol-
lections. More Americans follow, then
Fabre ( Life of the Grasshopper), Gosses
Swinburne, Gorki’s Jn the World and Rodin,
the Man and his Art, get a look in.. The
poet laureate of the year was Wilfrid W.
Gibson ( Collected Poems). The only
humorists mentioned were also Anferican.
Franklin P, Adams and W. E. Hill, who
were jointly responsible for Among Us Mor-
tals. No Anzalians were represented.

Indented Steel Bars in- the Ship's Bulwarks.
Prow View of Ship gives Idea of the Vessel's Size.
The above photographs, reprinted from the “Engineering News Record,” January, 1918, show the
latest application of reinforced concrete and Indented Steel Bar reinforcement to shipbuilding.
The brains of the Indented Bar Co.’s engineers have ever been to the fore when new problems had to
be faced—and solved.
Our Indented Steel Reinforcing Bars, rolled in Australia,
are used in all the Government Wheat Silos in N.S.W.
Reinforced Concrete Construction by means of INDENTED STEEL BARS makes possible lighter-
weight structures that are absolutely Fire=safe and everlasting.
They save time in erecting. They ensure permanent construction. They mean a big saving in cost.
Architects, Engineers and all others interested may obtain full particulars from us.

SYMPTOMS OF KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
ARE YOU IN DANGER
THROUGH IGNORANCE?
Nearly all of our readers suffer from
aches and pains of some kind at one time
or another. Aches and pains very often
mean kidney troubles. Such symptoms as
Constipation, Backache, improper action
of the bowels, pains in muscles and joints,
nasty taste in the mouth first thing in the
morning, swelling of the feet, cloudy
urine, a general feeling of weakness and
irritability, all these are symptoms of
kidney trouble.
They are caused by the poisonous acid
in the blood which the kidneys should
remove, but they do not owing to their
being in a weak state.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the cause —the
poisonous Uric Acid. Remember, to do
this, a real remedy must pass through the
kidneys and the bladder, and not through
the bowels as most kidney pills do. When
you see the urine change to a muddy bluish
colour—a feature which distinguishes De
Witt’s Pills from all others—you know
beyond all doubt that they have put their
healing touch on the right spot—the
kidneys and the bladder. A wonderful
pill—straight to the kidneys—that is the
reason why De Witt’s give such amazingly
quick relief every time. A permanent
cure follows in almost every case.
You should go to your Chemist at once
for a box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills, and prove for yourself that within
twenty-four hours these wonderful pills
have commenced their healing work. Do
not put off, because weak kidneys very
often means Bright’s Disease in the end,
but be sure you get genuine

in large blue and gold boxes. De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills are sold by
Chemists and Storekeepers everywhere,
2,9 and 5/6 per box. Large size contains
two-and-a-half times as many as the 2/9
size—most advantageous. If you have
any difficulty in getting genuine De Witt’s
Pills— with the blue seal on the cork —send
your money to E. C. De Witt & Co., Ltd.,
42-44 Pitt Street, Sydney, who will gladly
supply by return. TRIAL BOX FREE

Storm.
The banner of the wind is out —
Hark to it surge and strain
In kingly folds that, flapping high,
Fill with delight the ringing sky,
Above the squadrons bearing by
The lances of the rain.
Where glittering ranks swoop down and
down
In swift, triumphant bands,
By passion heaved, by frenzy bowed,
Thrilled by the pageant rolling proud,
The quivering forests cry aloud
And beat their swarthy hands.
And wide and free above them all
The billowing banner flies;
With gust of song and clash of steel
The marching troops swing toe to heel,
The drums exult, the trumpets peal
In splendor to the skies.
Deep laughter, crackling lightning, swift
Leaps down the rhythmic train;
Where the long lines their chorus raise
Eyes eagle-fierce intrepid blaze,
And high and shrill a courser neighs,
Tossing his rippling mane.
Oh, all the lawless gods of old,
Whose blood no ruth has thinned,
Stoop through the swirl of steely rain
To tread the smitten earth again
And follow with a shouting train
The banner of the wind.

What shall it be that Memory brings

M. FORREST.
The Holy Thing.
It was a palmer, hand on staff,
Came back from Holy Land.
He trolled a song, I heard him laugh
Along the yellow sand.
The sun was drowning in the sea;
And of good heart he bore
A token found in Galilee
Beside the ancient shore.
Fair was the wood and smooth and black,
Dovetailed and square and true;
The box was strapped upon his back
For Christian men to view.
The palmer, with his staff and shell,
The bench and workshop sought,
That Christian carpenters might tell
How fair the joints were wrought.
“What thing is this that he would show? —
God’s love’s the Devil’s loss! —
This is no wood, as well we know,
Nail-marked of holy cross!”
“No wood of holy cross,’’lie cried,
And paused that all might see,
“ ’Tis wood of holy sweat and pride
Hand-wrought in Galilee.
“Of holy nride and holy sweat
And skilful hand it came —
More price upon this sign I set
Than on His cross of shame.”
He trolled a stave, I heard him laugh;
Of all good heart was he,
The palmer leaning on his staff
Beside the sunset sea.
“Oh, holy sweat and holy breath! —
God’s lore’s the Devil’s bane! —
Oh, holy saw of Nazareth !
Oh, holy square and plane!
“Stooped at a bench below a tree
He wrought it fair and true—
Look, Christian carpenters, and see
The work the Lord could do!”

ABOUT FINISHING THE OLD JOBS
FIRST.
“Nationalisation under democratic control of all
hanks in order to finance public works without loans,
create Socialistic industries and nationalise the means
of production and distribution.” — Proposal from
N.S.W. Laborites to be submitted to the great trien-
nial conference in June.
It is a good general rule to finish the old job
first. Now, the above-quoted proposition
represents in part an old job of the Labor
party. Yet what has Labor really done of
all the things that it could have done
easily? The production of plenty of ships
and the distribution of food by means of
these ships represent two nationalised and
Socialistic enterprises which have been cry-
ing—even screaming—for attention during
years past. They don’t involve the taking
over of any big and hostile private under-
takings. They don’t mean a fight to a finish
with capital, bloated or otherwise, for no
one is more anxious than the capitalist to
see the wheat and wool and wine and frozen
rabbits shifted to the European market. The
business that is required to make big profits
is there ready to hand. In one State at any
rate the necessary workshops are also ready
to hand and practically idle: not ordinary
workshops either, but the very finest thing
in the Southern Hemisphere. Yet Labor has
done its share, by the wealth of deep con-
sideration which it has given to every detail
of the scheme, to prevent anything being
done, and it hasn’t once given an energetic
shove to the dilatory politicians, who have
done their share by much waste eloquence
and hot air. In the way of Socialistic
enterprise and control of production and
distribution this was the easiest job of all,
because of the lack of competition; and it is
the most unfinished job on the list, for it
hasn’t really begun. # ,
Public ownership of land is essential to
public control of the means of production,
and it is a great and profitable business if it
is in the hands of men who know how. There
is an ideal unfinished job in the Federal
capital. The materials to work on are a
territory which belongs wholly to the people
and which can be indefinitely enlarged if
the powerful Labor party means business;
a Federal city—the only one in the world
which is the metropolis of a whole continent
with the people as sole ground landlords
and rent collectors; also a seaport town on
deep water which can have almost unlimited
room to develop if the potent Labor party
resolves to get the room. Of this also the
people will be sole ground landlords and col-
lectors of ground rents. True, neither the
city nor the seaport town exist because they
are denied the railway facilities which should
bring them the trade of southern N. 8.
Wales, and because nobody seems to care,
and because they are disconnected, some fools
or knaves having supplied this continent with
a metropolis in two fragments 100 miles
apart. Rut the intervening territory could
be acquired if Labor said that it wai t to be
acquired. Then the way would be open for
public control of land and production and
distribution. Only utter ineapables could
make the work a financial failure, unless
they wanted it to fail. It would be a com-
paratively small experiment, for so much of
the land is already acquired, and with the
special advantages attached it would be n
matter that even a very tired party could
handle. Ahd there are other good ports—at
least two 6f them in N. S. Wales —around
which much land could be acquired for a
song, and which, with railway facilities,
could become the sites of more seaport cities
with an assured future and the community
as sole collector of ground rents. Then
public control of land, production and distri-
bution would flourish like the bay-tree, with
every prospect of easily-earned dividends,
and Labor could stick out its chest and feel
that it had proved the soundness of its prin-
ciples on a good wicket, and shown that it
isn’t a mere dreamer and borrower and pro-
moter of strikes. Also by keeping its belated
promises of decentralisation it would show
that its word can be relied upon if the
country waits long enough.
* * * *
Still there is no reason why the proposed
“democratic” banking device shouldn’t be
tried. Presumably the idea is that the Com-
monwealth Bank and the Federal and State
savings banks don’t fill the bill because,
though they belong to the people and are run
successfully for the people’s benefit, they are
managed by a small oligarchy of experts,
and not by popularly elected committees of
enthusiasts. In that respect they are not
“democratic.” Yet to be “democratic” and
nationalise all the banks at once would in-
volve either one of the biggest loans (about
£36.000,000 would be required to buy up the
capital and reserve funds even if no allowance
was made for goodwill) or the biggest steal
ever carried through by a peaceful nation. A
suspension of payment might be necessary
after the purchase or steal, for if depositors
became alarmed at the new departure and
started heavy withdrawals and burial of the
money they would exhaust the stock of cash
in short order. And it is difficult to see how
money could be provided for public works,
etc., “without loans”; for if the advances
made by the “democratic” banks weren’t
loans bearing interest in the dull old way,
they would have to be gifts, and if they were
gifts the “democratic” assets would all van-
ish in a very brief space. In any case there
is only £23,000,000 or so of coin in the banks,
which wouldn’t go far for public works loans.
Socialistic industries and nationalisation of
distribution and production, in addition to
working the ordinary business. As for the
paper money, it wouldn’t be worth. seizing ;
as easy to print a new lot.
* * # *
It might be better to try it on one bank
to begin with. A comparatively small but
vigorous institution might perhaps be
acquired, or better still a new institution
might be started. With the blessing and
deposits of Labor Governments, trades unions
and Labor supporters (who number about
half the community, so that the remaining
20 banks would only have the other half to
depend on) it would spread like a vine and
overshadow all rivals. And when success
had vindicated the system the way would be
open for a larger movement, and opposition
would be disarmed. In this manner the good
work could begin almost at once, while to
wait till it is possible to go the whole hog in
one bite might mean waiting for the Millen-
nium or the Revolution or the Resurrection.
* * * *
The bank is only one possibility among
many. A great deal might be done in the way
of purely “democratic” enterprise—which
presumably means management by the people
in a general way and not by hired expert
autocrats who may make money for the
people but lack real sympathy with the
I.W.W.—if the beginnings were not too
ambitious. But the old jobs, such as the
ships and the wheat, the opening of the
closed ports and the Australian capital, with
its splendid possibilities of public land owner-
ship, production and distribution (the pro-
duction of new cities and their distribution
in the vacant spaces is a worthy ambition),
should be completed first. It is an untidy,
slatternly and scrappy business to leave rem-
nants lying about. Also it- looks ignorant
and incompetent.
THE MILLS OF GOD AND 600 M's.P.
Referring the other day to a proposed revi-
sion of the Labor platform by inserting a
plank labelled “Abolition of State Parlia-
ments and their replacement by an improved
system of local government,” Sydney Tel-
egraph demanded to know whether the
Liberals were going to produce a similar
plank, and if not why not. It is, the Liberal
paper can see, simply no use pretending to
be afraid of unification any longer. The
world is being shot to pieces, and what is
going to be done with the various fragments
makes a problem not peculiar to the Com-
monwealth. Reconstruction there must be,
whether people like the idea or not. and the
citizen’s yearnimr for change is not going to
turn upon whether he is a Liberal or a
Laborite.
* * * #
Pressure of the problems incidental
to public and private finance is alone going
to force alterations in the method of govern-
ment. If Australia was as rich as the place
referred to in ancient fable, the country
would be brought to beggary by a system
which permits seven Parliaments to go on
from year to year, each regardless of the
others, borrowing, taxing and spending.
Before Federation we were lured on by hopes
and prophecies about the cost of government.
That the hopes and prophecies have all been
exploded by experience matters very little.
The crux of the business is that the hid-
eously increased bill has been paid, or passed
on till to-morrow, without yielding any
observable benefit to the people. The State
Parliaments, shorn of their greater respon-
sibilities, have degenerated into mere narks.
The Federal Parliament, impeded by the
States in all directions and consumed by a
hankering after an authority which no Par-
liament was ever competent to discharge, and
as applied to the Australian continent would
be the wildest experiment with disaster, is
not much better. If the States bungled and
muddled before, they go on doing the same
thing now. If they were recklessly extrava-
gant originally, they have been even more so
since. If the issues and responsibilities that
were flung into the Federal arena were pre-
viously in a condition of chaos, their latest
aspect is, on the whole, still more tangled.
To-day Australians find themselves tied up
in a knot, suffering exploitation, with a
superstructure of government having no
parallel on earth, and national affairs made
the sport of caucus wirepullers in two or
three cities.
Whether the best or the worst happens
over yonder where everything that is vital
to the future of Australia is being deter-
mined, this country is going to have plentiful
reasons for doing some hard thinking and
close figuring. The maintenance of 14
Houses of Parliament, with all the attend-
ant officialdom and flunkeydom, and of seven
armies of Red Tape is not only indefensible
on economic grounds; judged by results it
is a sure method of obtaining confusion,
waste and debt. They have to go. A unifi-
cation that would consist of merely rolling
this stupendous outfit into one, vesting it
with the same sort of authority as is pos-
sessed by the State Parliaments —of putting
every city, town and camp in the Common-
wealth into the position of being a beggar
on the doorstep for doles of backsheesh —is
almost as shuddersome to think of as per-
petuation of the existing mess. But a unifi-
cation that would allow the people to deter-
mine the broader issues of national policy
through a National Parliament; that would
carve the existing unwieldy States into
halves and quarters and permit of real self-
government and responsibility being
shouldered by the inhabitants of these divi-
sions; that would give Australian industry
and development opportunity to strangle the
incubus of centralisation —all this could be
understood and given three cheers. Liberals
know this as well as Laborites. But both
will know more still when the full effects of
the bill begin to hit them.
OPEN ORDER.
A gun with a 75-mile range is dropping
shells on Paris. It is the latest development
of the hellish business which goes by the
name of modern war and is possibly designed
by Providence, or whatever looks after the
thinking arrangements of mankind, to drive
home a large and serious lesson to the
world. At the time when lighting and
throat-cutting seemed the regular occupation
of the races of men, battle was as neighborly
as a football scrum. Warrior met warrior
knee to knee and whisker to whisker and
banged, and cut until something yielded.
Then invention got to work and devised
weapons of precision. Guns began to shoot
straight, and the whole shape of war has
altered. As far back as the Peninsular
wrangle Wellington won victories by
developing the line against the column. It
was a mode of fighting by which the artil-
lery of the day was made less effective and
one man behind a musket was enabled to do
the work of three if his discipline and cour-
age could stand the test. The soldiers in
column had the moral support of the densely
packed mass of men among whom they
moved : but those in line must fight indi-
vidually without such support. British
troops took to the new mode, and the result
was that victory was secured against the
tremendous forces of muddle at home and
military genius in the field. But the thin line
of Wellington was still a frightful target
for the instruments of destruction, and
weapons of precision were further improved.
When death came dropping in from a dis-
tance of several miles the wider the space
that separated the targets the better their
chance of escape. Hence open order was
the maxim which ruled the new military
tactics; and although the German, by terri-
fic sacrifice of his own troops, has secured
advantages in the old way, there can be no
doubt that the Wellington idea was cor-
rect. The less dense the mass the smaller
the loss—this must remain axiomatic, even
though on special occasions the massing of
men for slaughter may achieve something. By
opening out the ranks the army is made
larger, provided its will-power and courage
will stand the strain. The thing comes to
be prettv much a matter of moral values.
One man behind another has some additional
armament of moral support; two men stand-
ing apart and firm in their own strength
can deal a double blow.
All this is equally true in an economic
and commercial sense when dealing with the
distribution of population. The theory that
congestion means progress is one of the
insanities of modern civilisation. In most
cities of the world to-day the great bulk of
the people are merely standing in the road
of one another and blocking the aim of the
man here and there who really wants to do
things. The waste of time, which might
be profitably spent otherwise, in merely
waiting for trams and trains in any modern
toVn represents a sum of money which, if
properly spent, would easily abolish all the
poverty in that town; while the moral sup-
port of the strap-hanger, who rides home to
tea on your corn or breathes early-morning
beer upon you as you think out the pro-
blems of the day. does not appear to be of
the value it is cracked up to be. More than
that, the greater number of those who make
the morning rush from their suburban homes
to the town are merely going there to dupli-
cate the work of .others. Draper's shop
stands in the road of draper's shop and
factory in the road of factory, and keen
competition causes trickery to replace plain
business method. It is impossible that the
trader should think of the public good and
aim at it where there are a dozen or fifty
rival traders blocking his view. The town
stands for the old advance in column as
against the open order which would be
represented bv a properly-organised com-
munity with its effort widely and effectively
applied by a proper distribution of popula-
tion. Once that town was something like a
necessity. It held together mainly for
defence. Within its walls trade and indus-
try could be conducted with comparative
safety, while outside every road was infested
by brigands and the blood of the unpro-
tected individual citizen was shed at every
cross-road. But the safety and protection
offered by towns has gone long ago. Life
and property are safer in districts where the
population is widely spread: and trade is
only on a sure basis where it meets actual
needs without overlapping and all the intri-
cacies of competitive intrigue. All the worst
miseries of poverty belong to the town, and
disease has always its stronghold there;
wlule the moral support of masses of men
amounts to so little that it is admitted on
all hands that the race deteriorates in the
closely-packed places and requires the revivi-
fying streams of the country-bred to keep
it up to normal. In a word, the modern
city is a plague-spot that can find no better
excuse for its existence than that it is a
progressive development of the walled vil-
lage in which civilisation had its start.
* * * *
And now modern war has produced a gun
that can strike a city at a range of 75 miles.
That gun cannot lut a haystack nor pen-
etrate a fort at that distance except by the
merest accident; but the huge city lies wide
and helpless before it, with the city’s chil-
dren waiting to lie murdered in their beds.
Such a gun fired from a position far beyond
reach and sight, of Melbourne could be
trusted not to hit any particular military
spot in or about the city ; but it would be a
source of calamity and bitter loss to the
general public. The first shot might drop in
Kensington, the next in Kew, the third in
Carlton ; but every shot would mean a wail
of horror and despair. Hitherto there has
been a shadow of doubt about the extent
of the danger from bombardment of the
coastal towns; now there is none. In a
plain military sense, a single unnecessary
building in a trading centre of any kind is
now a danger to the whole; and the aboli-
tion or reduction of cities becomes a matter
of political urgency. Decentralisation has
long been talked about and the issues con-
nected with it purposely clouded by the
insincere talker for votes; now the matter
is being forced home with fire and steel.
The geographical shape of most Australian
States lends itself to the creatioji of a num-
ber of deep-sea ports with a network of
smaller but closely associated trading centres
at some distance inland. The whole ques-
tion must be tackled with a new earnestness
in the light of the latest military develop-
ment. Decentralisation is the first step in
our strategy of defence; and the politician
who merely plays with the subject to catch
a chance vote is not only a trickster but
something dangerously like a traitor. There
are, of course, land-owners and brick-
owners who would fight for congestion even
if it meant the murder of thousands of
women and children and the loss of all we
live and hope for; but these, though noisy,
are a small minority. The deadly danger is
close and terrible and in the light of it
divisions should cease. The gun now mur-
dering sleeping babes in Paris might reach
our own crowded centres far sooner than we
think; and to be forewarned is to be pre-
pared. if only the talk can be silenced in the
interests of doing real things.
THE PRISON FARM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Except for the merits or otherwise of the
system of administration one Australian
prison anywhere is monotonously like
another anywhere else. A more or less im-
posing gateway, high surrounding walls, and
ranges of cells geometrically built about flat
yards. Everywhere spotless cleanliness,
the smell of soap-suds and fresh paint, and
occasional flower-beds of a mathematical pre-
cision. Everywhere pallid men with scraggy
beards, who give no indication of the posses-
sion of high spirits. Everywhere uniformed
warders, locked gates, steel bars and the
jangle of keys. There is no scenery except
the sky. And always an atmosphere of
constraint, of watchfulness and of some-
thing unnatural. Every prison is suggestive
of a socialistic state, where each man gets
his share, where laws are equal and inevit-
ably administered, and where the dullest is
as good as the brainiest and infinitely hap-
pier. After you have seen one, so far as
a cursory inspection goes, you have seen them
all. But when you go to look over the
prison farm at Emu Plains (N.S.W.) you
will see something different, something that
is as little like the conventional gaol as it is
possible for any place to be where prisoners
are housed, fed and worked.
To understand the peculiar usefulness of
the Emu Plains establishment, it is necessary
to consider the system of classification in
vogue in the N. S. Wales Prisons Depart-
ment. Inmates of the gaols are divided into
10 sorts, as follows :
(1) Prisoners under sentence to penal servitude,
or to imprisonment with hard labor, for two years
and upwards.
(2) Prisoners convicted of felony and misdemeanor
and sentenced to hard labor for lesser periods than
two years.
(3) Prisoners under sentence of imprisonment only
(other than 9th class prisoners) and persons detained
during his Majesty’s pleasure.
(4) Prisoners awaiting trial or under examination.
(5) Lunatics, comprising persons supposed to be of
unsound mind.
(6) Debtors, comprising persons confined for con-
tempt upon civil process.
(7) Male prisoners under So years of aye at the
time of their conviction, undergoing sentences not
exceeding IS months’ imprisonment, with or without


hard labor. Prisoners of the first and second classes
under 25 years of age at the time of their conviction
may, on completion of separate treatment, be dealt
with in accordance with the 7th class regula-
tions, and for such periods as the Comptroller-General
may deem necessary.
(8) Prisoners who are treated as appellants unuei
the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act of 1912.
(9) Prisoners committed to gaol under the provi-
sions of Sections 8 and 11 of the Deserted Wives and
Children Act 1901, or Sections 5, 15 and 18 of the
Infants Protection Act 1904.
(10) Prisoners convicted of misdemeanor under
sentence of imprisonment without hard labor, and
who, upon the recommendation of a Judge before
whom they have been tried, have been ordered by the
Minister to be placed in this class.
The paragraph above that is printed in
italics deals wholly with the class from
which the prisoners employed at Emu Plains
are selected. They are all young men,
who have not as yet had “inside” oppor-
tunity to graduate as gaol-birds of the sort
that you may see in the convict prison at
Parramatta, or, less unmistakably, at
Bathurst. Nearly all of them have come
from the ranks of the first offenders who are
interned at Goulburn, or, for special leasons,
in the Penitentiary at Long Bay. A few are
serving the whole period of their sentence
at the farm. At present there is accommo-
dation for about forty.
The peculiar excellence of the Prison Farm
lies, of course, in the fact that these young
men are out of the gaol atmosphere of the
regular establishments, and are away from
any chance of association with older prisoners
whose room is more desirable than their com-
pany. But, apart from this, the mental
stimulus must be very great. They are not
shut out from the world by high walls. They
can see that it is still a good place to be free
in. They can look at it across green fields
—which is a more inspiring way of looking
at it tlian by means of mental processes that
are limited to a recollection of conditions
of life unbounded by a cell door, by the steel
bars of exercise yards, or by the prison gate.
And the work that they do is healthy, inter-
esting, and shows its results.
The prison buildings are made up of a
quadrangle of some 40 little huts, each about
the size of a large cell, with cook-house,
store-rooms, offices, bathing-places, and the
cottages of the staff and officers. There is a
large reading-room, where games such as
draughts, chess and dominoes may be played
after working hours. Meals are eaten in the
huts. Only at night is there any locking up ;
at nine o’clock every man must be in his
residence, and an armed patrol mounts guard
until daylight.
The enforcement of discipline by means
of punishment is unnecessary, since a pris-
oner knows that he is at Emu Plains only
upon good behavior, and that the slightest
breach is liable to be rewarded by a return
to gaol. It is hardly surprising to find that
breaches are very rare. In each hut is dis-
played a printed communication, signed by
the Comptroller-General, “To Men Employed
at Emu Plains,” which is worth quoting as
indicating in some measure the spirit in
which the place is run :
The changed conditions under which you now find
yourself will, I trust, appeal to you and to your sense
of honor, and that you will realise that a special
opportunity is now afforded you to improve yourself
in every way, and to cut away from gaol life for
good and all, and that you will show by your conduct
during the remainder of your sentence that you appre-
ciate in the fullest degree the efforts made to enable
you to regain your self-respect and to fit you for a
fresh start in life along better lines than those that
caused your temporary lapse.
You can see, and no doubt realise, by your new
surroundings what is before you in the great change
effected for your welfare ; and with yourself rests the
effect of it upon your future.
It is scarcely necessary, 1 hope, to remind you of
your duty and conduct while finishing up here; of the
respect and obedience to those in authority above you,
and the strict adherence to rules and regulations,
which are simple, clear and for the general benefit
of all. Cleanliness both in mind and body, as also in
the manner in which your living-place and articles
are kept, is looked for as a matter of course ; and I
trust that results will be shown in the future of
your life that will be in accord with my best wishes.
Of the working of the place as a farm
there is not space to say any more here than
that these 107 acres beside the Nepean River
are fairly profitable to the Department.
Between pigs and asparagus there is a wide
scope of husbandry, and it is easily to be
recognised that land that would normally be
attended to by a father, a couple of grown-up
sons and some unfortunate kids can be cul-
tivated pretty intensely by two-score young
men who are personally interested in not
going slow. Going slow means going rapidly
back to gaol, and that is the least desirable
thing on earth to these agriculturists. They
are, in a sense, on their honor—but they are
given completely to understand that this
honor system has its limitations. “Be good,”
it says, “and you’ll find it pays. Don’t be
good—and you’ll find yourself back in quod.”
They are very good at Emu Plains.

Two Voices, a Telephone and a Vision.
The great advantage of dreams is that they
can’t be censored. Also a person may admit
to himself in a dream things lie would be
afraid to say even to himself —let alone to
the other fellow—in his w 7 aking hours. He
can be frank and valiant on his pillow: the
ostrich slumbering on its brass bedstead in
the night may allowably have a vision that
it took its head out of the sand and "looked
the whole situation in the face, though it
would not —not for bags of gold—suggest such
a thing by day. At this point The Bulletin
mentions that it had a dream. It concerned
a wonderful telephone connecting Australia
with England; and the plaintiff was there
and the defendant was here. And the con-
versation was something like this: —
That Voice: You know that we have reached a
crisis at which soldiers are wanted as they were
never wanted before since our history began. Yet
food is wanted even more urgently than soldiers.
We are almost driven to tell our biggest ally that
we will try to make shift with a few less men, bad
as affairs are, so that there may be more ship room
for food. You have enough grain on hand to feed
all Britain for a year or more. Why don’t you send
it?
This Voice: Well, you see, we haven’t the ships.
That Voice: Why haven’t you built the ships?
Why aren’t you building them now?
This Voice: We can’t.
That Voice: Don’t be a liar. Don't tell me that
people of British descent can’t build ships. The good
God wouldn’t allow such a race of degenerates to
cumber the earth.
This Voice: We had such a lot of labor difficulties
to begin with
That Voice: But you have Wages Boards and
Arbitration Courts and all sorts of agreements, mostly
devised by the Labor people themselves, to prevent
strikes and other troubles.
This Voice: Yes, that is so. We have about COO
Boards sitting, but all the same there were more
strikes in the last two years than ever before.
That Voice: Are you a crowd of d —d Huns
that your industrial agreements are only scraps of
paper? Does nobody enforce the penal clauses of
the Labor Acts? Does nobody use the War Precau-
tions law? Doesn’t somebody do anything?
This Voice: Any Government that did much would
lose votes.
That Voice: Well, I heard that when a big pri-
vate company arranged with a State Government to
build wheat-ships the Central Government interfered
and the business was stopped. So it seems you can
do things so long as they are the wrong things.
This Voice: I heard something like that.
That Voice: Do the Germans pay these people who
always seem to prevent you doing anything worth
having in the way of sending us food ? Are you
traitors or Bolsheviks or only degenerate loafers?
This, Voice: Your language is shocking. You
aren’t the only people w'ho are suffering. We have
lost millions through not getting our foodstuffs away
while the foreign prices were high.
That Voice: Does that mean that you would
rather lose millions than not oblige the Hun by
failing to send us your available food ? Or what
does it mean?
This Voice: I told you we had labor troubles
That Voice: Tell me something more. If your
people’s signature is of no earthly value at the foot
of a labor agreement when it suits them to repudiate
it, will it have any more value at the foot of a bond
or debenture when it suits them to repudiate that —
say when they can’t get any more loans so that it
isn’t worth while keeping up their credit?
This Voice: You might make allowances
That Voice: 1 do. You publish statistics alleging
that you are the richest folk on earth in proportion
to population, yet one of your Premiers was creeping
round here the other day—the other day, when I
have had to borrow over £500,000,000 in the United
States myself to help along the war —and he was
asking for money to build permanent and reproduc-
tive works. And I made him an allowance of
£3,000,000. I’ve made you more than
£100,000,000 of allowances since the war started.
To change the subject, if you don’t find money and
won’t find ships and fail to find food, what about
men ? I know you did splendidly at first, but what
about now?
This Voice : Well, we’re keeping the matter before
the public. We had two referendums about compul-
sory service, and the political campaigning was won-
derful, and the speeches would have done your heart
good. And we had a big political crisis. The Min-
istry resigned because it was pledged not to hold
office unless compulsory service was carried, and it
took office again the same day to show that it rose
superior to defeat.
That Voice: Just another scrap of paper. Well,
tell me, why do your State Governments want so
much loan money now, at ruinous rates ? Is the
idea to find plenty of easy, highly-paid work for able-
bodied men so as to induce them not to join the
army? Is it another Hun dodge?
This Voice : Loans are simply a leading feature of
the settled policy of the country, like settling people
on the land and not settling up when a loan falls
due but asking for a renewal. I assure you we are
not idle or unaware of our obligations. For instance,
the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy
are going to England shortly if the Huns don’t drown
them on the way, and
That Voice: Speaking of the navy, supposing the
next Wolf or Wolves should attack your big coastal
cities and your coastal shipping, what coastal defence
ships and submarines and airships have you to meet
the danger?
This Voice : Dunno !
Then the sun rose, and the Voices died away,
and the Censor resumed work at the old
address, and the morning paper arrived with
all the strike news, and the ostrich put his
head back in the sand.
♦
Suppose the Answer is “No.”
Treasurer Watt has risen in his might and
declared that the thing is impossible. “Any
idea,” said Treasurer Watt, “of Australia
repudiating its loan obligations is too silly
to talk about....lf any persons are saying
anything to the contrary they should be pro-
secuted.” Well, the idea of repudiation,
which is saying “I won’t pay,” is unthink-
able, unless the Bolshevik party, of which
that Russian alleged Consul-General
Simonoff is allowed to be the prophet, should
get possession. But default, which is saying
regretfully “I can’t pay,” is quite another
matter. The fact which Watt ignores is
that, unless we make a stupendous change in
our methods, our ideas, our whole political
outlook, we have no voice in deciding whether
we will default or not. The position is that
the State loans repayable in London in gold
are about £240,000,000. These are not war
debts, which are a separate aqd purely Fed-
eral matter, but liabilities incurred through
laziness, luxury, shirking; through the evil
counsel of importers who preached for their
own selfish ends that it was better to import
than to manufacture, even though constant
borrowing was required to keep up the gold
supply necessary to pay for imports; and
through the shameless treason of Foreign-
trade papers and politicians who did the
importers’ dirty work. The swelled head in-
duced by the comfortable assurance that this
borrowing land was the richest coun-
try in the world, and that our assets
amounted, at inflated loan boom valuations,
to £1,872.922.672,312,832,502.602 2s. 2d.,
also helped. So the fact stands out that
unless we make a radical reform we don't
know whether we will default on our British
debt or not. It doesn’t rest with us. When
a big gold loan or batch of loans falls due in
London all we can say is: “We have made
no provision to meet this liability. We
depend on you to lend the money afresh.”
If the answer is “Yes”—so far it has always
been “Yes,” though the last time we heard
that glad monosyllable the rate of interest
was of per cent, or more, allowing for ex-
penses and sundries —well and good. If the
answer is “No” the difficulty might perhaps
bo surmounted once. It could hardly be sur-
mounted twice unless we did something really
astonishing in the way of stopping imports
and the consequent drain of gold, and did it
in good time. It isn’t far us to say that we
will never defaultj we hare yot into a situa-
tion where the other fellow decides. There
are five reasons why the other fellow may
say No: (1) The State credit is depreciated
in the ordinary course of things by the con-
stant increase of debt; (2) ditto by the
dreadful reputation we are getting for
revenue deficits; (3) by the obvious neglect
to cut down ordinary outgoings in this time
of stress; (4) by the stupendous borrowings
of the Commonwealth for war purposes;
(5) by the fact that Britain has had to raise
some five thousand millions or so for herself
and her Allies. Our situation may be
summed up briefly like this: —
In 1916 we exported nearly £10,000,000 more
coin than we received (some later figures will be
available shortly). All this was payment for im-
ported yoods.
The gold and other coin in the Australian banks
was about £23,000,000 when last heard of, against
£36,000,000 31 years previously.
All the gold in the N. S. Wales banks wouldn’t
have paid off that N.S.W. loan of £12,648,477 which
fell due the other day.
All the £03,000,000 or so of paper money which
is doing so much to create a local boom wouldn’t
have paid the odd £477, let alone the other
£12,648,000.
During the 4$ years from December, 1912, to
June, 1916, Australia’s imports exceeded the
exports of merchandise by £34,465,000, the
result of too little local manufacturing. And
that kind of balance has to be settled in
yold. What wonder that, when the British
debt payable in gold falls due, we have to
hint to the creditor that unless he finds the
money and gives us a new loan his chance
may easily be Buckley’s? And why should
we utter bounce to the effect that we will
never default, if we stick to the policy which
leaves us hardly any voice in the matter?
The Problem of the Cocked Hat.
Some remarks made the other day by
Assistant-Minister for Justice Fihelly, of
Bananaland, about the status of the Cocked
Hat, gives the impression that that aggres-
sive young man would be satisfied if the
decorative effect was a local product and
“accepted the advice of his advisers” on all
occasions without remonstrance. “No im-
ported person,” he explained, “has a right to
dominate Australian democracy.” The point
of Fiiielly’s criticism seems to be that the
substitution of a functionless local marion-
ette for an imported official who has at
least some authority over the persons pull-
ing the string would yield new and enlarged
freedom. This paper has no liking for
Cocked Hats as Australia knows them now,
but it would have just as much distaste for
the millinery visualised by Fihelly. It is
no use exchanging one calamity for another;
and it is no use supposing either that the
mere rooting out of Governors is an act
complete in itself. Australian experience
shows that, when it comes to a question of
dominating the Parliaments and the democ-
racy, the evils done by their Exes, are not
a circumstance compared with achievements
in a similar direction by Ministries. If
The Bulletin had to choose to-morrow
between the present system and one that
would leave the public wholly a prey in
State and Federal affairs to the perform-
ances of party Ministries, it would vote for
the former every time. The legitimate ob-
jections to the Cocked Hat system are
these: (1) That the thing is an extrava-
gance; (2) that it is imposture to the extent
that it is an inadequate protection to the
public against Ministerial abuse of authority;
(3) that its social influence and example are
pernicious; and (4) that the connection it
maintains witn a monarchical system is, if
not fictional, wholly grotesque. Now, put-
ting a local individual in the same attire,
stripped of constitutional authority to do
anything except nod his head and take his
pay—and it is inevitable that the job would
fall to some adroit party heeler —would
leave the situation unchanged except for the
worse. The solution of the thing is to abolish
the office and simultaneously to establish a
direct system of control by the people through
the Courts over the eternal yearning of
Cabinet to set up in business as a collective
autocrat and take the electors down. This
yearning is ineradicable. There are times
when the democratic politician can be the
most irresponsible individual on earth, and
on those occasions he can be relied on to be
a very ardent advocate of just as much
reform as would give him a bit more rope.
The question for the people is not what
“advice” might be given by the “advisers”
of an imported or local Hat. but what
advice these persons might give to them-
selves if then was no one to pull them up.
The case for getting rid of a superfluity is
stronger every year, but the case for control
of machine-made politicians is more powerful
too. And it is not a bad test of a politician’s
faith in an undominated democracy to see
how far he will go in one direction and how
little in the other.

Motherhood.
Dear Bulletin, —Many of “Dysistrata’s”
remarks (B. 21/3/’18) are quite correct;
others are so naive as to be silly; or perhaps
it is only our old friend shirk masquerading
as indignation, a disease common in this
country. “What more natural,” she asks,
“than that women [in wartime] should wish
to avoid the further anxieties and perils of
pregnancy?” Has she no heart or imagina-
tion for the anxieties and perils faced by
our men in the trenches? They’re doing
their job there; why should not women do
theirs at home? Both jobs are vital to the
nation. Her talk about degenerate stock
is beside the mark, for, on her own showing
—the showing of “a healthy, normal woman
of 26”—the determining factor in restric-
tion is not that. “Is there,” she asks, “amy
sound reason in the world for having chil-
dren except that one wants them?” Is
there, indeed! Has it never dawned upon
“Lysistrata” that society is possible at all
only because it has some sort of moral
conscience—that, till man rises into
some kind of consciousness of the equal
rights of others with himself, there can be
no such thing as society V And what is the
selfishness so naively advocated by “Lysis-
trata,” the shifting of the social burden to
others for a frivolous private advantage—
what is this but a most dire infringement of
the law of equality? Moreover, to think
further along her own lines, why should men
have to provide the means of existence for
just such wives as our friend speaks of? All
shirkers, men and women, are national para-
sites and deserve little of the nation.
“Lysistrata” smiles at “the girlish sim-
plicity’’ of a Methodist conference. God
knows such conferences are generally simple
enough; but the brick in this case surely
breaks one of her own windows. Women are
all right; what they need is a little real
education in the meaning of society and in
themselves. Listen to this: “It [a preven-
tive] entitles the man to indulge a completely
illegitimate sexual appetite [with a prosti-
tute] with impunity, while it forbids the
woman [his wife] the satisfaction of an
indisputably legitimate one:’ (Italics mine.)
Sexual intercourse, even among married
persons, if it be for purely selfish
ends, is not recognised by any decent
system of social morals as legitimate.
As modern writers put it, marriage
without progeny is legalised prostitution. It
is high time the Government was compelled
to print and distribute some sensible litera-
ture touching on this matter. That candid
and useful book “National Notes,’’ by Wil-
liam Blocicsidge, ought to be more widely
known. In conclusion, let me bid a cour-
teous adieu to “Lysistrata.” 1 take off my
hat (nguratively—it’s a soldier’s hat) to the
mother of one son, and feel sure that her
native intelligence will prompt her to further
good deeds. She will not fail us.—Yours,
etc., F.R.C.S.

The Decay of the Railways.
A deputation which applied to the N.S.W.
Railway Commissioners for a better railway
service between Sydney and Newcastle
received the sort of reply that had to come
sooner or later. It was told that there were
likely to be less trains instead of more, and
it was hinted that they were likely to be
inferior trains dragged at a slower pace by
worse engines. The first cause is the de-
crease of rolling stock and the increasing
venerableness of what rolling stock there is.
A fool people has listened too long to the
glozing lies of Foreign-trade rags like the
Argus and Courier and Herald and Tele-
graph, which bade them stick to the great
natural industries of growing wheat and
freezing raobits (both now a drug in the
market), and rely on British ships to carry
them away (which they have ceased to do).
Also the fool people were instructed that it
wasn’t worth while to put our soul into such
skilled industries as the making of our own
ships and locomotives and land and marine
engines, and steel plates and softgoods. be-
cause these could always be inmorted on
British ships, and that the manufacturing
habit wasn’t worth cultivating while Ilun
goods were cheap, and that there was
lots for our people to do at building rail-
ways, for the British loan would always be
abundant and chean. These Foreign-trade
theories being all lies, the Commissioners
broke the news that the helpless people here
haven’t learned to build their own rolling
stock except on a small scale and to a great
extent with imported materials, and that of
materials ordered abroad three years ago
not one ounce has been received yet. There
is no prospect that they will be received till
a good while after the war is over, and long
before then, unless this country gives up
having a strike twice a week and gets to
work, many of the lines may be closed and
the rest worked by derelict trains that look
like ash-barrels on wheels.
A. Man Who Is Afraid He Must Burn
Something.
“Sassafras” : Having read acres of hot print
about the wickedness of the men who burn
thousands of pounds’ worth of timber just
to clear the land for a few cows, I decided
that when I got a block I would do some-
thing else. This is the plain tale of how I
fared. First of all, I thought that I might
do a bit for our small-arms factory, so I
wrote to the N. S. Wales Forestry Depart-
ment offering all the timber on the land, vir-
gin bush, to be tested as to its suitability
for manufacturing gun and rifle stocks. In
due time I received a reply stating that my
communication had been received. I waited
weeks and weeks for a further reply, got
tired, and then wrote again. Then I re-
ceived another letter asking me for the local
and botanical names of the timbers growing
on the area. I forwarded a list as desired,
and received a reply asking that samples be
sent to Lithgow. I cut samples measuring
2ft. Gin. in diameter and 3ft. in length, and
arranged with the railway people re freight.
Mai] day arrived bringing me a letter from
the Department informing me that samples
would not be taken which exceeded 3Mn-
in diameter. I wrote pointing out that
timber of that size would consist of three-
parts sap, as the trees would be young and
immature. I added that the samples I
already had were cut from old and mature
trees. I did not receive any reply for a
month or so. I again wrote, and then received
a reply stating that the manager of the Lith-
gow Small Arms Factory had gone to America,
and the matter was postponed indefinitely.
A friend then advised me to write to furni-
ture-manufacturing firms offering white silky
oak, stave wood, yellow wood, ash. hickory,
myrtle (a beautiful polishing wood with an
exquisite grain), beef-wood, leather-jacket,
sassafras and other varieties. All the furni-
ture-making firms turned the business down
as they had “large stocks of imported timber
on hand.” I then wrote to the sawmilling
cos. in Sydney, and they regretted they could
not do any business, as my timber would cost
them more, than the imported. I still consider
it criminal to fell and burn such a valuable
national asset. But lam afraid I will have
to make a big fire one of these days, if our
National Government does not put a red-hot
duty on imported soft-woods. My timber, by
the way, is only five miles to deep-water
shipping and six miles to a railway station.

The German Punch.
All of the stuff that has been handed out
during the last week or so about the Ger-
mans having '“failed in their objectives” and
their advance having been ‘‘less rapid than
the time-table provided for,” and so on and
so forth, in the strain made familiar since
the days of Mons, should be put aside as
irrelevant. The facts are that the enemy had
within a week thrown back the British army
for distances varying from two to thirty
miles, and that after this stupendous effort
he was still strong enough to push on the
attack. It was not a surprise assault. It
was not even one that had only been expected
for a day or two. It had been prepared for
in advance, and, unless everything that has
been said is rank perjury, it was awaited
with confidence. Obviously what had not
been anticipated was the weight of the Ger-
man’s punch. That he was frightfully mauled
appears certain. Nor is there any good
reason to suppose that the British and
French forces escaped similar treatment.
There is abundant evidence that the troops
which stood up to the fiery blast the German
let loose fought with supreme courage and
endurance. But the crux of the thing is
that they have been on the reverse gear, that
their line has been greatly lengthened and
therefore weakened, and that the German is
certain to press on with his effort. Broadly
speaking, his object is to either break or bend
back the line of defence in the direction of
Amiens, and, immobilising the British by
envelopment in the North, push down the
valley of the Oise to Paris. It is too early
yet to talk about the danger of this having
passed: as Lloyd George reminds us. the
struggle is only opening. It is for a mastery
which, if gained by the enemy south of the
Bomme, would throw the whole Allied battle-
line into confusion. Meantime, supposing
the Hun is blocked again, there will still be
the job of holding him down. At the best it
will be a task calling for strong men and
many of them. Are xve going to trust to
luck and making stump speeches to reinforce
our army? This paper long ago gave up try-
ing to answer that question. Also, it long
ago came to the conclusion that the question
never will be answered so long as the com-
munity is doned with trash about the German
being on the verge of collapse and the Allies
being on the eve of overwhelming victory.
The position is one of extreme peril. It is
madness to call it anything else.
The Bulletin’s old friend “Jimmie
Pannikin” (Donald E. Fraser) shocked bis
friends early this week by dying suddenly at
bis home, near Sydney. A fortnight ago
Fiaser sat down and discussed himself. A
big. exceptionally vigorous Australian, he
bad never been able to do tilings bv halves.
Tie toiled hard first as a N. S. Wales State-
school teacher and then as an inspector;
and when he left off toiling hard for the
Department it was only to toil just as hard
at something else which he called recrea-
tion. “It wou’d have been all right if I
could have kept under 50: but I crept past
if. and then —to my horror—l was ill.” lie
did not know how ill: and his death from
heart failure at 54 was unexpected. There
was never a more devoted Australian than
Fraser. He loved his land with the fervor
and whole-heartedness of a bridegroom ; and
he was the same lover whether he was
Donald Fraser. Inspector of Schools, or
“Jimmie Pannikin,” writer of fugitive Abo.
paragraphs. Next to Australia he loved the
child ; and if there is no child slavery in the
Cow Country, as the dairymen now insist,
it is mostly because Donald Fraser and
Jimmie Pannikin joined their forces to make
it unpopular.
“Bad Australian” (from S. America) : Of
course we know that the South American is a
tired and generally unreliable person, and
that Ire is a firm believer in putting things
off until to-morrow. Nevertheless, a few
davs ago a Chilean firm launched a steamer
of 1000 tons displacement, the biggest for
Chile to date, and all done since shipping
became scarce. When this is considered in
the light of Chile’s limited resources it looks
as if shins to relieve the present pressure
<an be built almost anywhere provided the
country has a little ginger in its composition
and isn’t governed by German gold. By the
way. how many steamships of 1000 tons has
Australia launched?
“Star” : As one who knew John Madden
personally and professionally, let me assure
“Fax” (B. 21/3/T8) that he does the
deceased judge a great injustice when he
suggests that his attitude towards a prisoner
was ever influenced by consideration of his
social position. Madden was admittedly a
weak lawyer, but he was also and always
a man of undoubted integrity, and. far from
favoring the “well-connected” criminal, pos-
sibly no judge on the Victorian bench ever
rated that class of wrong-doer more severely.
Anyone who met him in his judicial capacity
would certainly have made a grievous error
if he had tried to trade on the fact of having
been acquainted with him gubernatorially.
On present appearances tlie Phewsion will
get its second nasty clout on Saturday,
this time in S. Australia. It won’t he a
knock-out like it was in Queensland; but
party will improve its position
out of all recognition. After the Referen-
dum smash there were auout four official
Lahorites left in the S. Aus. Assembly; but
having inspected the liberals at close quar-
ters more than half the men who left the.
Labor party will have no more to do with
them, and will either run as Independents
(like ex-Premier Crawford Vaughan) or
stand down altogether (like ex-Lands Min-
ister Goode). A few of those who play a
lone hand have a hope owing to the fact that
several S.A. electorates return three mem-
bers apiece.
“Unpontius Pilot”: Labor’s big win in
Queensland demonstrates one outstanding
fact. The Nationals, if they want to do
anything with the Democratic donkey, will
have to dangle the carrots in front of his
nose and not tie a tin to bis tail. The sort
of argument that condemned the Labor
party, not for its attitude on Conscription,
but because the Premier was a capitalist
who could wear three pairs of boots while
the union secretary could only afford two.
and which openly declared by whole-page
advertisements that if the Labor Govern-
ment was returned to power everybody’s
banking account would be confiscated, de-
served what it got.
Tin* mysterious Federal Police that are
straying about Bananaland. keeping an eye
on the eggs, were conspicuously missing a
week or two ago. A deliberately worked-up
run on the State Savings Bank followed the
return of the Labor Government, to power,
and the public telephone was largely em-
ployed in the villainous campaign. People
were rung up and advised to withdraw their
deposits from the State Bank because it was
shaky and the Ryan Government could not
meet its liabilities. The message was anony-
mous and was always from a “friend” who
declined to mention his name. The panic,
for which there never was an atom of ex-
cuse. was serious for several days—-the
crowds could not all get inside the Bank
and the police had to line them up. The
State police, that is; as before remarked,
the Federal police were so conspicuously
absent that it looked as if the misuse of the
telephone to wreck a bank was a matter of
no concern whatever, so long as the bank
was Ryan’s bank.
The Australian Government has declared
its fixed resolve to send a cablegram to blood-
stained Europe stating that this country
“has every confidence” etc., and that “what-
ever needs to be done will be done.” And if
a small, fat messenger boy goes climbing
over the innumerable dead and wounded, and
(lie ruins and the gas and the rush of ammu-
nition vehicles, to convey that glad assur-
ance' to Haig and Foch and Pershing, and
a shot from the Hun’s 75-milc cannon strikes
him on the fourth button of the waistcoat,
one more widow may lose her only son
through utter political futility.
There was once an airman whose machine
collapsed at a height of 10,000 feet, and as
he began to fall he resolved to buy a prayer-
book and lead a better life. Also there is a
Socialist party in Russia which declares that
it will resume the war when it has better
men in office than the comic-opera Trotsky
and the musical-comedy Lenin. But the days
are gone and dead when the fiery cross can
be sent out and an army raised, and if
Pompey stamped his foot to-day and the soil
grew soldiers it would be no use unless
Pompey could grow 8000 big guns with his
other foot. No one can get drunk with the
whisky that is past.
Percy Russell, who has contested several
seats as a Laborite —latterly as a follower of
the “official” body—is suffering from the
aftermath of his strenuous campaignings, the
last of which was against Irvine of Flinders.
Russell is very ill indeed and has lately been
taken to a hospital run by Dr. Frank Drake
in the high country at Mitcham (Vic.),
where he is now engaged in a desperate
struggle with the Reaper.
“Australia Jane” waves her old friend off:
Died last week, aged about SO, “Lady” Barrett, a
queer old soul who pervaded Brisbane streets in the
wreck of a sulky behind the ruins of a horse. A
few years ago she used to ride a pantomime nag,
wearing a habit which had been built by a London
tailor, long since gone to Asphodel. At one
Federal election the old lady insisted on standing
for the Oxley seat, and addressed several meetings.
A convulsed and packed audience at the Exhibition
one night was wooed with song—she said it was
“Annie Laurie,” but it might have been anything else.
However, she retired before nomination day. It is
to be hoped there are horses wherever Mrs. Barrett
is taking her rest, for she would be very lonely
without them.
“S.S.” : In a Swanston-street bar the other
afternoon somebody shouted for a newly-
returned soldier. The first gulp went wrong
in his throat. “There,” said Billjim, “it’s
so long since I had one it’s forgot the way!”

’Tis in the Land of Make-believe and Mushy Senti-
ment,
Where hungry poets snub the toffs who pay their
garret rent
And millionaires are hoggish dolts, anil everybody
makes
A practice of persisting in most obvious mistakes,
The Cinderella Man abides, a bard with views
supernal,
An illustrated hero from the dear old London
Journal.
And o’er the housetops, through the snow, to phase
a sudden whim,
A millionaire's young daughter comes, a maiden spry
and slim :
Her nature being clean and sweet
She comes along on fairy feet
To bring him dainty things to cat.
But leaves her heart with him.
Oh, honey bees and turtle doves 1
Oh, simple, artless plan !
The interesting lady loves
That Cinderella Man.
The hero with the lovely eyes and legs divinely long
Accepts the girl as someone else, nor deems her eon-
duct wrong.
No thought lias lie for aught lint work, his special
line is verse ; •
Whilst dreaming of his Hue career he nukes Ids
mash his purse.
He thinks her quite the nicest piece of skirt he ever
met-o,
Because she feeds his daily needs and types his
great libretto,
Yet treats her only as a pal, an undesigning mbs,
Anel never ceases writing verse to snatch a willing
kiss.
The present poet never knew
(And, in his time, he’s met a few)
Another bard so cold and true
And circumspect as this I
Ob, Shade of Mrs. Potiphar 1
Oil, Maudie, Flo and Nan !
Not many verse-providers arc
Like Cinderella Man!
The haybag who collects the rents (and keeps the
lodgers good)
Detects the bard at dinner with the nymph who
brought his food,
And bids them leave her shabby home, where virtue
is the word !
Then doth the Dollar Queen depart, her soul with
anguish stirred.
She stays at home to brood upon this incident
dramatic,
And learns that Anthony (her sainf) has sought
another attic.
A musical composer then the hero’s fortune founds —
lie wins the Great Libretto Prize, and nets two thou-
sand pounds.
His heart (date, his brain awhir),
No longer a self-centred churl,
He breathes his passion to the Girl,
And happi ,w s abounds.
Oil, crude molasses ! Nectar pure I
syrup in a can!
The dollared syren marries, sure,
The Cinderella Man.
* * * *
“The Cinderella Man,” staged at Melbourne
Royal last Saturday night, is not such an
artless play as the story sounds. Many ele-
ments of popular success are in it. There
are no knots in the thin thread of interest;
the appeal to the sympathies of the uniniti-
ated has no interruptions. Plot, - dialogue,
little jokes and glaring inconsistencies are
all in harmony. The atmosphere of incon-
sistency, with its perfume of theatrical
roses, is maintained throughout. The char-
acters are innocent of all suspicion of real-
ity—-the self-made millionaire who roars like
a tactless simpleton; the travelled girl who
lias flirted for weeks abroad with an atrocious
ass without discovering the mean stupidity
which he reveals in two minutes when he
brings the engagement ring to her father’s
house; the impossible young poet who ob-
jects to borrowing the price of his rent;
the virago landlady who turns money away
from her garret; the nice men in minor
parts. They amount to a hunch of fictions,
tied together with pink ribbon. Nevertheless
the false coinage rings pleasantly, and girls
will mostly think the play pretty. Kathlene
Macdonell makes a winsome angel visitor
to the beauteous young man who is in love
with his career in the attic, and M aldron
might stand for a portrait of high-minded-
ness on stilts. Roy Redgrave tills the con-
genial billet of a white-haired philanthropist
hovering around the doves; Styan is the in-
credible parent who seems to have amassed
great wealth by uprightness and cranky
irascibility; Kily Malyon is the viragoic
daughter of Mother Grundy; and Frank
Hatherly (with song). Greenaway.
Plumpton Wilson, Brampton and Cambourne
assist to carry four short acts across three
long intervals.

In real life, when a man, returning unex-
pectedly late at night, finds liis bed occupied
by a feminine fellow-guest, he merely
says “My mistake!” and discreetly retires.
Matters might not be so simple if the man
were in love with the lady and the lady rather
liked the man. And if the man, having been
rejected by the lady, had engaged himself to
a nice flapper, and the lady had divorced her
husband and now rather wanted him back,
the man would fly without giving himself time
to say “Sorry !” But complications might arise
if the lady had gone to bed in a nightie “that
simply invites catastrophe,” and if the man
had been drunk or a Hun. Marie Tempest,
in “A Pair of .Silk Stockings,” produced at
Sydney Criterion on Saturday, must plead
guilty to having worn the sort of night attire
that seems absurd unless it is to
be seen by some man; but, as Cyril
Harcourt, the dramatist, makes her re-
mark. “Women do wear that sort of
thing” even when they are divorced.
And the Major, who at midnight burgles his
own bedroom, is a decent chap, after all.
On the American stage this bedroom incident
would develop into hilarious farce with a
French accent; but as Cyril Harcourt is an
English dramatist, all he provides is refined
comedy and arresting drama. For there are
the further complications of the divorced
husband secreting himself in the bedroom for
the purpose of winning back his wife; and
the appearance, at the wrong moment, of the
nice flapper to whom the Major is engaged.
But the bedroom scene remains entirely in the
hands of the lady ; and the dramatist has done
excellent work in the dialogue between_ the
two, in which, moreover, Marie Tempest’s

lightest inflection of voice carries tremen-

when the situation depends solely on a look,
a tone, a gesture; and Marie Tempest’s art
triumphantly carries her through. But
from the moment when she arrives at the

when she takes back her husband, the artist
is beyond criticism. A new note, however,
is here added to her gamut: there are
moments of sincerity of which, hitherto, this
critic had not thought Marie Tempest
capable.

It is for this aspect of the star’s art and
for the clever work of Graham Browne that
the public should see this comedy. For the
work of the dramatist is banal, except for
his subtle dialogue and brilliant character-
drawing. The first act is fatuous and
filled with superfluous males, and its
comedy falls flat with a heavy thud. But
Cyril Harcourt has depicted a whole com-
pany of real people. They are English, of
course, but they are not mere types: there
is keen observation behind the dramatist’s
dialogue. A minor part, Irene Maitland,
well played by Gwen Burroughs, is as
truthfully conceived as that of the genial,
good-natured, delightful fool, Sam. Sam, so
pathetically lacking in nous , could never be
taken for an Australian. And Graham
Browne presents that absurd, altogether
honest English chap with a wealth of unob-
trusive detail that makes Sam almost
painfully alive. One wonders how Graham
Browne gets and fixes on Sam’s face that
look of thick bewilderment and of a vague
grievance against the world; and the final
trick of the portrait is his pathetic efforts
to stop himself blubbering. Sam’s blubber-
ing is as enchanting as Molly’s nightie.

Sidney Stirling is admirable in his part
of the burglar-catching Major. Eileen Robin-
son has not had the experience necessary for
her big opportunity at the “curtain” of the
bedroom act. The rest of the support is
good. The staging is tasteful, but for a
gentleman’s bedroom the furnishings and
decorations seem quite too feminine and
dainty. Still, the dramatist knew that bed
was going to be occupied by Marie Tempest.

A new Southern Cross Film Co. is giving
a trial run at Adelaide Royal to “The
Woman Suffers,” nearly all (except for the
Melbourne Cup scenes) of local preparation.
The story is of a very small boy who gets
lost in the bush and is adopted on a strange
station. The growth of Philip and the other
children is indicated by relays of Adelaide
kiddies. When they are grown up the two
men are played by Roland Conway and Boyd
Irwin, the heroines by Lottie Lyell and
Evelyn Black. The scenes are supposed to

MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Quintard, the poet (Charles Waldron), tells
Jerry Primrose (J. Plumpton Wilson)
that his opera is worth ten thousand
dollars.
bo in Victoria, and Adelaide audiences
(packed twice a day) have welcomed with
amused delight an occasional railway station
or villa or waterfall that is recognis-
ably local. The scenery is charming, and
altogether the play is a marked success. But
the later part of the story calls for the axe.
A boyish visitor seduces Philip's sister, and
Philip, as a suitable revenge, swears to
seduce his. It is done as easily and quickly
as it is planned ; the first drive together is
enough. In each case the acquaintance is so
slight that neither girl’s family knows whom
to suspect. The only possible moral is that
every Australian squatter’s daughter must
be chaperoned with a 19th century European
strictness, or she will fall a prey to the first
comer. Which is absurdly libellous.
Scenic-artist W. It. Coleman painted some
fine old English cloths for “Dick Whitting-
ton,” now Lord Mayoring at Her Majesty’s,
(Sydney. The one of the Thames, showing
clumsy old fourteenth-century ships an-
chored in the stream, is particularly striking,
and it seems a waste of background not to
have a better story in front of it. After
the amiable Dame and Idle Jack have robbed
Alderman Fitzwarren’s till and put the tup-
pence in Vera Pearee-Whittington’s peggy-
bag, the thread of the old story is pursued
in some way until Miss Pe-Whit. is discovered
in a beautiful Coleman wood with old Lon-
don dozing in the purple distance. Then
the rising tide of modern irrelevaneies
smothers the plot, and there is little but
dancing, music and spectacle for the infant-
critic who is checking the show by the story-
book. But compensations are numerous.
The big stage is filled as often as possible
with girl, the dressing is bright if not start-
lingly original, and the ballets with Maggie
Dickinson and partner Sidney Yates twink-
ling in the foreground are ambitious evolu-
tions done with dash and finish.

Vera Pearce, ex-Queen of the Tivoli
Follies, returning to Sydney in principal-boy
tights, surprises most people by her subdued
methods. Pauline Bindley (Alice) looks
dainty and scores heavily whenever she
sings. Dame Arthur Stigant is at his best
as the pottering old lady who casually pours
the bowl of washing water into the drawer
of the table, pulls down the tablecloth and
resumes the conversation with the other old
fowl. Harry Roxbury (Idle Jack) is an
eager comedian looking for employment most
of the time, and Ernest Langford gets
through a long evening as an impossibly tall
boy who roars for chocolate. All the
comedians are severely rationed and the bee-
robbing scene doesn’t score like the building
of the fowlhouse in last panto. Villiers
Arnold, conscientiously horrible as regards
make-up, is a demon rat who gnaws at the
fortune of old-friend Howard Vernon
(Emperor of Morocco) and worries Pearl
Ladd, his very placid white daughter who is
a singer without a song. Constance Cayley
exhibits her trim figure and does nothing in
particular very gracefully. Freda Mitchell
is a charming little girl with a song of her
own. Le Brun is the good Cat with enor-
mous eyes, and when he has killed Arnold
Villiers somewhere off stage. Vera Pearce
has money to invest in the War Loan, and
the show is over.
“Canary Cottage” is again open to all-
comers at Melbourne Majesty’s, but the list
of guests is much the same as it was before.
The most notable change is in Dorothy
Brunton’s old room. Cecil Bradley now
occupies this : but Cecil hasn’t Dorothy’s zest
for hot and tireless flirtation under the most
exuberant comedy conditions. Another
change is in the matter of Maud Fane’s
mamma, who has become an extremely youth-
ful lady named Lusk, and maintains her
position with the greatest difficulty. Among
the old crowd Connie Ediss gives a petulant
repetition of an amorous cook sustained by
the memory of an inflammable kiss. Also
her freak hubby, Alfred Frith, stalks
Futurist fantods in his green pyjamas, while
William Greene continues his promiscuous
cuddling and heliographs his ardor with
flashes of gleaming teeth. Eminent in the
revival, further, is Madge Elliott, the brilliant
canary who is just as lovely as ever, though
her bright yellow tights are throwing
out a caution against overcrowding. The
divinity seems to be getting solid with too
little work. Next Saturday, “So Long,
Letty,” for five nights; after that “The
Bing Boys” bang in.
“The Woman Thou Gavest Me” is still
being pawed over at Sydney Opera
House; but the part that Omnipotence
played in the giving has not become plainer
after a week’s pondering. As far as this
critic can see. the woman had been given in
marriage to the wicked Lord Raa, but when
she gave herself to Martin Conrad she needed
no help. However, the aurora australis is
still working well, and the blizzard blizzes
first rate.

At Sydney Playhouse, which lurks in

“Aladdin” and the Lamp have been filling
Sydney Palace to overflowing twice a day,

The title “I Love You” is a finger-post to
the special at Sydney Strand. It is a charm-
ing variant of the old, old story, with Alma
Rubens as the sweet Italian heroine. At the
Crystal Palace Petrova has a part suitable
to her statuesque beauty, and as a “Daughter
of Destiny” thrusts a finger in the pie of
European trouble prepared by Wilhelm the
Mad Cook. Hoyt’s and the Haymarket tap
out “The Seven Keys to Baldpate,” with
old-favorite George M. Cohan as the lead:
and on the same screens “Anton the Ter-
rible” holds more than one gasp of horror
over the intrigues that rend the bosom —not
to mention the bones—of our ex-ally, Russia.
The Wirths were joyously hanging on to
their sector of Sydney last week, all

of the hippodrome and the bear remains in
great heart.
“THE MILLION DOLLAR GIRL,”
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Charles Albert as the Prince in the “Do You
Remember?” Ballet.
“Samples,” at Melbourne Tivoli, with
Workman in the mainstay character that
Phil Smith filled when the revue was first
staged in Sydney, strikes this average per-
son as being a better-class entertainment
than The Follies of old. Workman, Celia
Ghiloni and Frank Greene impart a sem-
blance of musical comedy to a series of
scenes some ,of which are humorous, and
several of the vaudeville items have a bite in
them. The Garden of Eden, with Jean
Keith as premiere pierrette (the bill calls
her Eve for no apparent reason), is as
quaintly novel in conception as the art of
the young dancer is beautiful. Jean is
otherwise useful in a Scotch dance with a
band of kiddies, and in a coon-song turn in
which the cutest of the youngsters are
delightfully funny. The words of the ditty
would seem hideously unsuited to tender
years if they really mattered, but the interest
is in how, not what, the nippers sing. On
the other hand the words of a dualogue be-
tween Workman and Celia Ghiloni matter
a lot. The two alleged old women exchange
malapropisms concerning the soldiers at the
Front, more or less painful to all save the
most hardened slackers. The carpet dancing
of the Magleys is a feature of the show,
likewise the bright warble of Nellie Leach
and the more sober vocalisation of Eileen
Boyd. And Mabel Holmes deserves a good
word for her happy sense of absurdity in
grotesque attire as a turkey, or what not.
Probably a what-not. Marie Eaton and
others may be mentioned in due course.
“The New Henrietta” takes a place at
Melbourne King’s on Saturday. The forth-
coming farcical comedy-drama is by the
author of “Turn to the Right,” and the co.
also will own (or disown, as the case may
be) the same parents as the cohort which
has been responsible for the performance
now passing hence.

The cause of various Melbourne infants
burgling their money-boxes during the week-
end was the appearance of Charles Chaplin
at the Melba Theatre on Monday. Charles
repeated himself in one of his reckless farces,
“The Property Man.” More entertaining
to the older hands was Mary Pickford in a
charming collection of her smiles called “A
Mender of Nets.” To-day the Melba switches
George Walsh into a Fox patriotic film,
“The Pride of New York.” At the Britan-
nia “The Sudden Gentleman,” who derives
his suddenness from William Desmond, has
been pushed into the void by Montagu Love
and Dot Kelly in a story of artistic Bohemia,
“The Awakening.”
George M. Cohan is standing well up to
the camera in his own version of “Seven
Keys to Baldpate,” at Hoyt's. Melbourne,
this week. The mystery that shot surprises
at Melbourne audiences during the Niblo
' season is enlarged in the film by the addition
! of new scenes, and is further quickened by
‘ the presence of a lively personality. Judged
by mere visual effects, Cohan is more art-
lessly volatile than Niblo. A clever leading
lady, Anna Q. Nilsson, and a carefully-picked
cast of Yankee favorites help to rush the
story to its giggly conclusion. In the second
feature, “Anton the Terrible,” Hoyt’s turn
the searchlight on the methods of the old
Russian Secret Police. The story has dag-
gers and dungeons in quantities and makes
recent Russian history read like an Argus
leaderette.
The Lasky production of “Joan the
Woman,” at Melbourne Auditorium, con-
tains a heavy religious atmosphere and pays
profuse compliments to the spirit of France.
Geraldine Farrar, the American opera star,
whose face is suitable for the expression of
Joan’s dove-like devotion, carries her hordes
of ironmongered warriors from triumph to
triumph against the English. The attack
on Orleans by a staggering quantity of
supers is a thrilling picture of combat.
Nearly half the movie is scrimmage, but
there is still plenty of room to sketch the
events that led up to the heroine’s interven-
tion. The photography is the work of an
artist, the first part of the film including
some exquisite interiors and outdoor scenes.
Wynne Jones’s orchestra of 20 supplies the
necessary musical footnotes with capital
effect.
The success of “Robinson Crusoe” at
Melbourne Bijou has compelled the Fullers
to add two more storeys to the office safe
and. provide treasurer Carroll with a steam
shovel. The show has properly caught the
fancy of Fuller’s public, and, judging by the
investment of the ticket-office in War Loan,
seems destined to put the Mint into tin l chil-
dren’s money-box class. The panto, is now
being staged twice a day, but if business
continues at this absurd rate it will have to
become a serial and run round the clock.

Good Friday brought the usual crop of
concerts in Adelaide, with Peter Dawson at
the Town Ilall. The Humoresks find the
autumn evenings cold at Austral Gardens.
At the Majestic the old “Revue” team of
I> Blanc and Mack have come back, and the
alleged mystery of Phrozo has been revealed
at last. The Anderson crowd at the Tivoli
has the old Bad Girl for the Easter holidays.
Wondergraph shows “Seven Keys to Bald-
pate” on the screen, which helps to make up
for the play never having come to Adelaide:
West’s have some clever players, but

“Hiram Muldoon” gives the facts: —
“T.O.T.’s” statement (15. 28/3/’18) that Francis
Abigail was the Minister who caused the removal
of the J.P. signatories to the Redmond address leaks
badly. The culprit was the then Premier Alexander
Stuart, egged on by Parkes, the Orange lodges and
the S. M. Herald. The address did not contain
any reference to “a foreign monarch.” It certainly
did protest against Ireland’s misgovernment by “a
foreign Senate.” Which is different. For Home
Rulers, at least of that day, accepted Grattan’s for-
mula—that “the King, Lords and Commons” were
the legitimate instruments of constitutional govern-
ment in Ireland. Poor little Abigail suffered so
much for his own sins that I cannot allow him to
be indicted for a fictitious offence.
“Copy Boy”: So much prayer has been

elections that the affair threatens to assume
the aspect of a religious controversy. J. .T.
Hall, a pushful* young man who had the
support of the cow and hayseed interests,
was declared elected by four votes; but
Bennington, the sitting member, prayed for
a recount. The Elections and Qualifications
Committee hearkened to his prayer and gave
him a majority of 34. Hall, having experi-
enced the comfort of the green benches for a
week or two and made quite a passable
maiden speech, is not inclined to return to
his secretarial job without a squirm, so now
he has offered up a prayer that the Elec-
tions and Qualifications Committee should
be sat on for having admitted as first pre-
ference votes ballot-papers marked with an
‘ X.” instead of the numeral “1.” Inciden-
tally he raises a doubt as to whether some of
the people who voted were the free and in-
dependent electors they represented them-
selves as being. As the House is now in
recess Hall will not know whether to believe
in the efficacy of prayer until next session.
Just-dead Colonel Legge, the old Artillery
officer who used to be Commandant of Tas-

For instance, it took him a year or two to

had been a base usurper and that Ben
Lomond was, and is, the highest mountain
in the island and probably had never been
anything else.

MINCHINBURY
MIMI : “Do you think I will he able to make
a living as ze model in Australia after
ze tear?”
BILL : “You might. I can give you a letter
to a eobber who makes a specialty of
painting old women."
“Copabella”: This is indeed a dreadful
war. A padre noted for his wowserism
while stationed in our Melbourne suburb
came back the other day and positively
revelled in having been called an “old bas-
tard” by the hard-cases of his battalion. “I
never appreciated a term of endearment
more!” he told his shocked audience, using
the word openly. Another padre handed out
this yarn. A great prelate was visiting one
of the hospitals, ana there found one of his
flock very much smashed up. “My poor
fellow, my poor fellow !” said the kindly old
man. “Oh. this is a bloody war!” “Yes,”
said Billjim, cheerfully, “it’s a fair .”
# * # *
“Tapu”: Among the ooys there is a feel-
ing that brass “A's” on regimental colors,
gold “wounded” stripes, chevrons to denote
years of service in a firing line, good con-
duct badges, ivions stars anti so on, are a bit
overdone. In one division of the A.I.F. the
wearing of “A’s” is forbidden by orders,
partly because it takes too long to prove a
man was actually at Gallipoli, and partly
because it is unnecessary, (fold "wounded ’
stripes are another mistake. Some men wear
two, three and even four of these who have
had, say, two slight wounds and two slight
gassings and never been in a stunt or
more than perhaps 14 days in any firing-line
altogether. The solid battler, who puts in
full time in all stunts and gets war-weary
and broken down at last, and goes away
sick, wears nothing, and the friends he
makes in England fancy he must have been
with the Pay Corps. War chevrons as passed
by the military high command in England
will partially obviate this; but as they will
be issued to men in a “proclaimed war area”
they will decorate military policemen, traffic
constables, It.T.O.’s, town majors, staff men
at Cairo, Alexandria, etc., M.L.O.’s and the
i 5 per cent, of the army which keeps the
other 25 per cent, where it can get hurt.
“Macko”: Years ago I employed one of
those baffling females who explain away
their misfortunes by saying that six masked
men broke in and did it. Believing her to
be unattached I began to notice that it was
high time she showed a wedding ring. She
told me a truly pitiful story. One Saturday
night when returning from a prayer-meeting
a wild man had seized and outraged her in
our back lane. I enquired, “Did you
screamV” “No! I was too frightened,” she
said. I: “Why didn’t you rush back and tell
us so that we could put the police on his
track?” She: “I didn’t like to disturb you
and the master.” I: “Then why on earth
didn’t you mention it next morning?” Her:
“To tell you the Gord’s honest truth, I for-
got all about it!”
“Fax” : Within the present decade Britain
has experimented with a couple of rotten
precedents. The first was the release of
“hunger strikers” on humanitarian grounds.
It was always clear that if a prisoner’s
refusal to take food was only to be met by
forcible feeding, and if forcible feeding was
to count as cruelty not sanctioned by the
legal penalty, the prisoner could beat the
law every time; and as burglars
and murderers were as much en-
titled to a hunger-striker’s privilege
as the suffragettes, the rule that
served the purpose of Mrs. Pank-
hurst and her friends was soon
dropped. The Law couldn’t pos-
sibly continue to be made an ass of
in that way. The other rotten pre-
cedent was the acquittal in London
of a returned officer who shot his
wife’s paramour. This case was
soon followed by that of a returned
corporal who murdered his wife in
bed because she penitently con-
fessed to an indiscretion during his
absence at the war. lie was just
bound over in a fiver to come up
for judgment when called upon.
The Law is now confronted with
the certainty of a plentiful crop of
murders of the same class, and it
is doubtless wondering how it can
best break the precedent’s neck.
The strange thing is that the
women haven’t already made an
outcry. For the new license law is
their funeral; judges would be
rough enough on a wife who mur-
dered her husband home from the
war on learning that he had ex-
changed endearments with a French
girl. Moreover, a license for
hubby to shoot the other fellow
with impunity gives that other fel-
low an excuse for shooting hubby
in self-defence, as he was apt
to do in the days of duelling. And women
don't want that any more than they want to
go to gaol themselves.

"Oh, no —Billy will apologise, and there's a new hat and a box o' chocs, in it.”
part of Tasman’s Peninsula this tomb owes
its ill-sounding name to an incident as yet,
I fancy, unreported in print. The vault was
constructed in Port Arthur’s early days for
the burial of high officials, but was patronised
by only a single coffin. In 1822 a murderer
called “Bang” Owens escaped from tbe settle-
ment. Soon afterwards the vault acquired
its haunted reputation. Ridiculing the
rumor, the English chaplain visited the tomb,
but never returned. A company of soldiers
was sent to raid the vault by night. They
found it occupied by two chained and leg-
•ironed youths who told their rescuers that
Owens —who was a sexual maniac—made the
tomb his headquarters. He often left them
for days at a time, but they were well sup-
plied with food which the boss stole on his
excursions. A new boy was sometimes among
his booty, whereupon he fed a discard to the
Point Puer sharks. Although Owens was
taken by surprise by the soldiers on his re-
turn two days later, he disposed of two of
them with an iron bar before he himself was
stiffened. For nearly a century the gloomy
apartment with the horrible history has been
kept closed, and the public refused admis-
sion. Recently, however, the embargo has
been removed, and the alacrity with which
Hie oportunity of inspecting the chamber
has been embraced proves conclusively that
the gruesome things are formidable rivals, in
the fancy of visitors, to the beautiful and
fair.

“Three Cows” : Following the roar of pro-
test in Melbourne against the display of
Sinn Fein colors in St. Pat’s Day nroces-
sion, Bendigo has been having its own joke.
The local A.M.P. building was flying a red.
white and green flag, hoisted at. the request
of the committee of the Bendigo Charity
Queen Competition. The A.M.P. representa-
tive, however, was persuaded that it was a
disloyal emblem, and demanded its removal.
A. J. Curran, the organiser of the competi-
tion, denied that it typified disloyalty, but
had to take it down. When it was explained
that the colors were those of the Queen of
Railways in the competition, and repre-
sented the guiding lights on the semaphores
—as the railway man’s rhyme has it:
White is “Right,” red is “Wrong,”
Green is “Steady, come along”—
the Mayor promptly flew the calumniated
banner from the Town Hall. Then the
A.M.P. agent offered to retract, but there
was fierce talk about demanding apologies;
and, in the midst of the commotion, somebody,
remembering that red, white and green are
the national colors of Italy, declared that an
insult had been offered to a gallant Ally.
But the Italian consul has a sense of humor,
and the whole thing ended in a cackle.
“W.F.8.” : Bill can still pump up a new
lie for being A.W.L. One of our chaps,
up at orderly-room for being adrift for a
couple of days, said he didn’t turn up be-
cause he’d heard that peace was declared
and he reckoned he was out of the job.

LITTLE WINDOWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Have you seen the little windows looking out on
lonely highways,
Looking out into the forests and the green of tangled
leaves ;
Little windows where the shadows of the street and
narrow by-ways
Keep the sunshine from the chamber where a white-
haired mother grieves?
Little windows, little windows of the dear homes
here and yonder—
Ah, you speak a pensive language to the world’s
unlist'ning cars ;
But I see you and I hear you, as in bush and town
1 wander,
Calling o’er the sea-swept distance and adown the
lonely years!
Calling ever for lost voices and the sight 'of war-
worn faces,
Of the men who knew those windows in the happy
long ago—-
And some are lost for ever in the war-field's desert
places;
Others feel the wingless longing for the windows
that they know.
Darkened windows, curtain blinded, where the little
children praying
To Heaven to guard the absent through the tumult
and the stress.
“O God, bless the poor dear soldiers!” you may hear
them softly saying,
While a white-lipped woman listens in the hush and
loneliness.
Yes. 1 see the little windows waiting while the red
day closes,
Waiting through, the busy daytime and the long,
long nights of pain ;
Those that see but stricken gardens, those that see
the bloom of roses,
Those that see their vigil ending, those that wait for
aye in vain.
And I love the little windows all so fraught with
wond’rous meaning,
Like the eyes of spirits seeking for some lost known
paradise,
And they know the land’s own secrets, and they’ll
see the harvest’s gleaning
When the nation reaps in glory what it sowed in
sacrifice.

SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE. NURSE FRANCIS, V.A.D., writes of Clements Tonic.
The proprietors of one of the leading weekly newspapers, Wellington, N.Z., whose letter can be seen if necessary, writes: —
“ Nurse Frances has just returned from the firing-line in France and used your Clements Tonic there. I’m sure her
testimony is of very great public value.” Nurse Frances herself writes; “1 should like to tell you how very
pleased I am with your Tonic as a nerve restorer. 1 have used it with very beneficial results. Several of our
nurses in France have also proved its worth. I can highly recommend it to any one suffering from brain-fag.”

“8.T.D.”: Some tract-distributors are
banding a nasty jolt to the women of “y
ultra-respectable Melbourne suburb. They
have left at every house a colored tract
which tells about the lady in the Scriptures
who was told to go and sin no more, and
ends by remarking: “Perhaps you, sister,
into whose hands this will fall, have sinned
and fallen.”
“The Old Soldier”: For mercy’s sake im-
plore the old State’s new Governor not to
add himself to the overwhelming army ot
military critics. He is, on his first appear-
ance, more unfortunate than the rest of
them. While talking to the Edith Cavell
Memorial Association he tried to cheer them
up about the Hun attack on the British lines
in France, and this was how he did it: —
But what is very certain is that this dash, which
up to now has cost the Germans half a million casual-
ties, will lose its impetus and be brought to a stand-
still. Then comes the time when, with fresh troops,
we will counter-attack, as Wellington did at W ater-
loo, and I trust that the parallel will be a true one.
Waterloo was a defensive battle from
beginning to end, and Wellington had no
fresh troops for a counter-attack, except a
cavalry division, which he sent forward to
charge the French Old Guard when it was
being driven down the hill by the British
Guards. Wellington’s only “fresh troops”
were Blucher’s Prussians, who began to
arrive on the Field of Waterloo late in the
evening and took up the pursuit of the
French. Ilis Ex. trusts that this will be
paralleled. Well, every man to his own
fancy.

Allan Whittington sends the yarn from
Shongweni, Natal: —
Here’s my own experience of war-meetings.
My brother and I were born in Sydney. The elder
of us served in the Matabele Rebellion of 1896, was
in the old Natal Mounted Police, served in the Lang-
berg campaign 1897, then in the Boer War, sailing
from Sydney in October, 1899. He was captured
and was a prisoner of war at Pretoria; escaped to
Delagoa Bay; returned to Australia, eventually sail-
ing again to Africa and serving with Warren’s
Mounted Infantry and then leading 25 Cattle Rangers,
all Australians and bearded like pards.
When the elder was captured the younger (I’m
the younger) joined up, and also served in S. Africa.
Returning to Sydney we met for the first time in
11 years. We had walked past one another without
recognition. We were together for 24 hours only,
as the elder was just sailing again for S’Africa.
The Great War-broke out. The elder, now married
with two children, left Rhodesia in August, ’l4, paid
his own passage to England, joined up and was
serving in the trenches in Flanders in December, ’l4,
with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. On a return of
malarial fever he was invalided out; but, determined
M—WELL!
CAY DOG : "Women and wine, Cissie!
They're hard to beat, aren't they?
Especially if the wine is good."
CISSIE: "Why, Harry, what about the
women? Don't you like them to be
good, too?”
to carry on, he sailed for Australia, enlisted with
the Australians and served in Egypt. Invalided out
in November, ’l6, and desirous of returning to his
home in S’Africa by the nearest route, he sailed from
Alexandria on a transport which called at Dar es
Salaam, German East Africa, to pick up returning
S’African troops for Cape Town.
The younger, now also married, joined the
S’Afrioan Forces in August, 1914, served during
the Dutch Rebellion and then in German
East Africa. Wishing to hand a parrot to a
member of the crew for safe-keeping on the voyage,
by devious alleyways he found his way to a gloomy
cabin, and getting into talk, the chap inside said
he’d take charge of the bird. After conversing in
the semi-darkness for a while he found that he’d
handed the bird over to his brother!
We had lost track of one another and had not met
this time for 16 years.
THE SCENE-SHIFTERS.
ARTIST COVE: “There used to be some fine landscape round here, but it's nearly all gone
now."
COCKY: “ It’s them damn rabbits — they've eat it alii"
Almost the last administrative act of
Victoria’s Bowser Government has raised
more dust than all its other acts put to-
gether. This was the purchase of the well-
known Studley Hall, in Kew, together with
three acres of land, for £5OOO, as a Hospital
for Women Suffering from Venereal Diseases.
Dr. Robertson, Chief Health Officer, re-
ported that it was the “only suitable place
he had discovei-ed.” The good Wowser
agrees cordially: it lies between the present
abodes of Dr. Mannix and ex-corporal John
Wren, and brings the World, the Flesh and
the Devil all nicely together.

“Copabella”: Two noteworthy Melbourne
divines met in Collins-street during “Boomer-
aug’’ week. One, who runs a big suburban
church, was sporting the popular tin boomer-
ang on his coat lapel. “Ah, brother,” said
the other, a Collins-street star, “I’m sorry
to see yon with that emblem of sin on your
coat!” “Emblem of sin /” gasped the aston-
ished s-burbanite. “Yes !” continued Collins-
street, solemnly. “Don’t you know every one
of those boomerangs carries a chance in a
prize? Gambling in its most insidious form!”
Suburbs was quite upset. “My dear ,”
he protested, “I never gave it a thought. I
was asked to buy it by the daughter of one
of my best people, and I took it in simple
good faith ! What could I say—what would
you have done?” Collins-street gave a most
unclerical wink. lie turned back the lapel
of his own coat and disclosed four of the
sinful emblems. “Under the lapel, brother,
under the lapel!” he chuckled.
* * * *
At Bendigo a wife who the other day
claimed maintenance from her husband was
found to be his niece. Both are young and
have been married only a few months. The
question of consanguinity being raised, the
Bench dismissed the case on the ground that
the marriage is void, and the maintenance
matter rests until a higher court gets to
work.

“Clutter”: Port Hedland (Nor’-West
Australia) pounces on the hat “Mookingah”
(B. 24/1/T8) throws down on behalf of
Tibooburra (N.S.W.). With a white popu-
lation in Hedland of 70 and another 150
in the surrounding district for 100 miles in
any direction you like to go, it raised for the
patriotic fund, in a single effort, by a two-
days’ picnic race-meeting and trimmings.
£l2OO. That represents more than £6 per
head and makes Tibooburra’s £2 per head
look like a society rag’s picture of the bride-
groom at a wedding.
* * * *
“F.S.S.”: The Sydney dailies have dis-
covered still another centenarian: this one
is 102. “He was born on board the ship
Red Rover, outside Sydney Heads, on June
2. 1816.”- Now, the shipping lists up to
1817 fail to show any ship named Red
Rover as arriving in Sydney Harbor. But
on August 13, 1832, the Red Rover, 372
tons, Captain Chrysty, arrived from London
with 202 free female immigrants and two
children, one of whom was born on the
voyage. This isn’t conclusive evidence that
the latest centenarian is actually under 90,
but it is conclusive enough that the claim has
holes in it somewhere, as is the way with
most of them.
MITIGATING CIRCS.
“Ain’t you and Darkie playin' speaks?”
“No; lie says I chip every hoy on the
beach.”
“Well, there aren't ever many hoys on the
beach now.”
“1372”: Casual Billjim again. I tvas
standing in the Strand whilst the girl was
busy at some shopping, when a Queenslander
walked up to me and asked me if I was do-
ing anything. I explained my position. “Oh,
it doesn’t matter much,” he said. “I only
just wanted a witness to my wedding. That’s
her over there waiting on me.”
* * * *
“Cherokee”: Let none complain hereafter
of the lack of zeal of P.M.G. Webster’s De-
partment. A Melbourne girl went on a trip
to Maoriland, and instructed the local post-
office to re-direct her letters. The command
was obeyed with thoroughness, every letter
addressed to any . member of the family being
re-addressed to her. She was bombarded
with dadVgas bills and cigar invoices ; ma’s
bridge invitations, Red Cross literature and
household accounts;
and all the varied
correspondence
which should have
been sacred to her
brisk young sisters,
including letters
from soldier-boys
at the Front. Even
her own letters home
were sent back to
her, and the more
she protested the
more she got them
on the ricochet.
Meantime the home
she had left was a
rude, unlettered
place, and growing
ruder daily. As
her dad said, it
might have been
the office of a
bowled-out agent
f o r Tatt.’s. She
wrote home ex-
plaining matters;
but her explanation
was pro mpt ly
thrown back at her.
A t last a letter
which had whizzed
back and fort li
across the Tasman Sea like the shuttle of a
weaver’s loom eluded the barrage, and the
mystery was explained. Of course Dad
swore to have satisfaction. But he is still
swearing.
ON THE BALL!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Football is to be resumed this year by all the
leading clubs in Melbourne.”
They slumber on Gallipoli, they rest in ancient
France;
No more that brave, brown iegion may repel the
foe’s advance.
Yet shall their fighting spirit die, their glory be
forgot
And time bedim the prowess of our brothers who are
not?
Ball up! Let’s boot the bladder, lads, o’ Saturdays,
and so
We’ll keep our cobbers’ mem’ry green—we blokes
who couldn't go!
This is the sport for those who wish to give the Kuis.
the knock,
A really useful job for men of sound Australian
stock,
Thumping the ball from here to yon, bumping it
back once more.
While 20,000 idle soi ls upraise a frenzied roar
And make, with verbiage rich and ripe, the skies
resound again.
Ah, here indeed is proper work for loyal-minded
men!
Still strain the war-scarred cohorts to approach the
greater goal.
Still strive the old battalions while the big guns
take their toll;
So while the talent, rain or shine, comes forward
with the dough,
We'll stick it, too, downhearted not, however things
may go.
Yes, while our struggling Billjims play the game on
fields afar.
The boys will throng the M.C.C., close handy to
the bar.
Ball up, then, boys! We’ll try to keep the old
traditions clean,
Playing the game to suit the sports about the greasy
green—
The swarming sports who meet to make mad noises
in their necks,
With language, plain or colored, as their heroes
please or vex.
We are the patriots, pledged to help the Austral
spirit grow,
And keep the nation’s pecker up—we blokes who
couldn't go 1

PERSONAL
ITEMS
National economy should get a good go
from AUctoria’s new Cabinet if Ministers act
up to their breeding. Of 12 members eight
are Scotchbyterian, and Lawson, the chief,
is a son of the manse into the bargain.
Hewitson, the new S.M. in S. Aus.—he
starts work at Mount Gambier —has had
most of his experience at Port Augusta, at
the other end of the State, where he was
mayor for eight years and practical man of
affairs for nearly 20. He is 63, spent his
boyhood on Tarrangower diggings (A r ic.),
started school-teaching in Adelaide when he
grew up and kept at it till Kingston advised
him to study law and gave the youth a berth
in his own busy office. Adelaide University
was just starting to teach law then, and
Hewitson claims to have been its first law
graduate.
A hardy old boy is septuagenarian J. Tay-
lor, B.Sc., F.C.S., father of Griffith Taylor,
of Melbourne weather bureau. He reached
Melbourne a week before Easter after riding
a push-bike from Sydney—nearly 600 miles.
The journey took just a fortnight, barring
CAPT. J. LYNG, Government Printer and
Interpreter, British Military Occupa-
tion, Ralaul.
Sundays, when he rested. Under sft. fiin.,
and weighing Bst. 31b., this ardent roadster
came from England 25 years ago, as Govern-
ment Metallurgist for the Ma State. Uately
he was munition-making in England, SO
hours a week, for more than a year. He lives
on two meals a day, and eschews meat, but
in four years his bike has carried him 7000
miles.
The war continues to supply women with
quite unexpected jobs. Corporal “Jim”
Vaughan, Attorney-General in his brother’s
Ministry, has been renominated for his Leg.
Council seat in S. Aus., and in his absence
his wife is doing the public speaking on his
behalf. Airs. Crawford A r aughan was known
to be a brilliant woman and a keen politician,
but this other development is new.
“De F.”: The first crop grown in A’ic-
toria, apart from the green peas and other
garden truck raised at Collins’s short-lived
Sorrento settlement, was not put in at Port-
land, but at AVesternport, according to Pro-
fessor Scott, whose job is Australian His-
tory. In 1826, eight years before the
Ilentys went to Portland, Captain AAYiglit
found that the sealers who had settled at
Settlement Point had two acres under wheat
and some maize patches around their huts.
Scott does not even leave the Ilentys the
distinction of being the first to build at
Portland, for he says that in 1832 AVilliam
Dutton had a
cottage there for
himself and huts
for his men in
the sealing busi-
ness. Scott con-
cludes that the
first explorer to
enter Gippsland
from the North
was a Hobart
m a n named
George McKil-
lop, who (in
1835, the year
Batman came
to Melbourne)
pushed through
from N. S. AVales
looking for
cattle country,
and got as far
as Omeo.
SAMUEL
HORDERN,
President of
R.A.S., awaits
the Vice-
Regal party
(N.S.W.)
Melbourne Uni. has just given the rare
Doctor of Letters degree to C. AV. Atkinson,
a Methodist parson of Fitzroy (AUc.). In
its 58 years the Uni. has only conferred this
degree seven times —on G.-G. Tennyson,
Baldwin Spencer, Sugden (Principal of
Queen’s) and three other Australian profes-
sors. Atkinson, a brilliant classical and
philosophical scholar, is the first Australian-
born to get it.
The only member of the new AHc. Cabinet
without previous Ministerial experience is
Hugh Campbell, the old-established member
for Glenelg, which is to say Portland and
lhe country at the back thereof. Campbell
is an ancient landmark, having storekept at
Portland since the days of his youth. Ilis
family has put up a fine record of war-ser-
vice ; but Campbell himself, considering the
length of his M.L.A.-sliip, has raised little
dust. His margin at the last election was
narrow, which helps to make it look as
though the honorary-portfoolishness was
merely a little parting gift from Liberalism.
This sort of thing is very affable and all
that; but it isn’t running the country as
Campbell would run his store.
Massey Greene, who is going to assist
Senator Russell to assist Jens August Jen-
sen to manage the Department of Trade and
Customs with the assistance of “two first-
class business men,” is one of the bright
chestnuts of the Federal House. Greene is
a vigorous young man who used to be a
clerk in the Bank of N. S. AVales at Kal-
goorlie, and on being transferred to Lismore
(N.S.A\ r .) saw that lots of men with less
energy and brains were banking more butter-
money in a month than the bank paid him in
a year. So he went cow-farming himself
and made butter-money, too, and then bought
other farms and now gets share-farmers
to bring in the butter-cheques. Nearly
every other man you meet in a motor-car at
Lismore does that.
Gordon Carter, lieut.-colonel in the A.I.F.
and one of the latest batch of D.S.O.’s, is
the eldest son of 11. J. Carter, many years
mathematical master at Sydney Grammar.
Young Carter was schooled partly at the'
Grammar and partly at King’s, and got his
engineering degree with first-class honors.
Before the burglar-alarms rang in Belgium,
he was an electrical engineer in N.S.W.
AVorks Department; and as he was one of
the young Sydney ’Varsity men who had
shown practical patriotism by helping the
compulsory-training movement as area-
officer, he was ready for a commission when
the real thing began. He was through Gal-
lipoli from landing to evacuation, and when
that tragedy was over he was set to organ-
ise and instruct a “pioneer” battalion in
Egypt, afterwards taking it to Flanders as
its colonel. A brother —also an engineering
graduate—was killed as a sapper in Gal-
lipoli ; another brother is a medical officer
with Australian troops in France; a sister
was till lately a staff nurse at Cairo.
Gone topside at Darwin, E. AA\ Ramsden,
a landmark of the Northern Territory. Since
ISBB he had been Warden of Goldfields, and
in the palmy days of mining in the Far
North used to lay down the law ruddily to
white and colored alike. “Rami,” as he was
known to all, passed out at 55. He was a
sprig of an old Yorkshire family, but his
breed and the doings of his great-great-
grandfather didn’t worry the Northern man,
who could never be fined for having Debrett
or Burke on his shelf. A happy soul, gifted
with irrepressible humor, in his earlier days
he skipped over the ground where the Ilun
has run amok. California, AVest Indies,
Mexico and Panama were on his visiting list
before he landed in Mackay for an English
sugar co. Then for a while he cavorted on
a big grey horse in the Adelaide Mounted
Police, and in ’BB hit the Territory. After-
wards, except for one trip to the Big Cold
20 years ago, he never left it.
“F.N.T.”: The late George Broughton,
who squatted in the forties of last century
at Lemon Springs, and in other fair parts of
AA r estern A r ic., was probably the actual
pioneer rabbit-fancier of his State. Brough-
ton always regarded bunny with affection
as a provider of sport and meat, and there
was a threatening gun waiting for anybody
who dared to get out after the mob without
his permission. Nowadays such of the old
man’s grandchildren as are not Hunning in
far fields spend a good deal of their time
between meals wondering what to do next
to bunny. There is a Broughton war-widow,
by the way, also engaged in rabbit pursuits.
This is Mrs. Stanley Broughton, of Toolang.
She used to be Grace Mackiehan, whose dad
managed the Union Trustee Co. for many
years. Mrs. Broughton now runs the place
herself, and dresses the boss-part in suitable
clobber.
Just dead at his old home and birthplace,
Cullenswood House, Tasmania, aged 77,
AVillianr Vincent Legge, retired Lieut.-
Colonel of Royal Artillery, which service
he joined in 1862. He became connected
with the Australian forces a few years later,
and assisted in the military reception of
the Duke of Edinburgh at Melbourne in
1868. Then he was in Ceylon, and while
there produced the standard book on the
birds of the island. Returning to Australia
he took command of Tasmania's little
defences and as a side-line became presi-
dent of the Australian Ornithological Union.
JUST DRIVEN TO IT.
PHYLLIS: “ Frank has dedicated his latest
look to me—put my name on the flyleaf
large as life, and then had the whole
thing copyrighted."
GRACE: “ Well?"
PHYLLIS: “Well, you see, now I must marry
him —I can't use my own name."
“E.J.M.” gossips about the Old Man: —
Alleged at one time to be the youngest Colonel in
the Australian Army, Colonel A. Windeyer Ralston,
son of Ralston, K.C., of Sydney, is known to the
rank and file as “Squeaker” by reason of his high-
pitched voice. He’s a martinet, hut he’s this sort.
When we marched out of Bapaume to entrain for
St. Omer last July we had dozens of “drop-outs.” It
was a dreadful time. At an early stage Ralston gave
up his horse to an elderly warrior, carried another
man’s rifle, and personally' hoofed it all the jour-
ney'. Never suspected of being emotional, the hard-
faced colonel of the 20th proved a delinquent after
the Bullecourt attack when an N.C.O. handed him a
roughed-out list of casualties. He knew it would
be heavy—as indeed it was for the whole division ;
but the solemn record of each company, showing it
would have to be re-formed in all sections, settled
his fortitude completely'.
Aubrey AA T alker is one of the few Tas-
manian-born able to get a decent job at
home without first graduating as a grand-
father. llis European and American experi-
ence has worn out the narrow insular view,
whilst fairness is not
confined to his com-
plexion. Having com-
menced hi s legal
training in ’96,
AA'alker should by
now be fairly well
versed in the lore of
the gentry who want
one-third of a flimsy
for telling you some-
thing you know in
language you don’t
don’t know. Four
years as Parliament-
ary draftsman should
also assist him in in-
terpreting Acts. His
chief amusements
are amateur theatri-
cals.
AUBREY T.
WALKER, LL.B.,
the Speck's new
Police Magistrate.
Ex-king Tino of Greece has had his pen-
sion of £25.000 a year stopped because even
now he can’t leave off dabbling in Hun con-
spiracies. There was a time when seven
Hapsburgs or half-Ilapsburgs were living on
the poor rate in Vienna because Francis
Joseph had taken the huff and stopped all
allowances. Tino may come to that—or
opening oysters.
On a matter of no consequence:
Re the early Australian career of the original
Mullins, father of lately-deceased Dr. Lane Mullins.
A friend of the family says the correspondent’s yarn,
given on the authority of an old Bulletin paragraph,
that Mullins started hereabouts as groom to Arch-
bishop Polding, is a “malicious invention.” Some-
body else writes that he had his first Australian job
among Australian horses at Mrs. Prosper de Mestre’s
homestead on Shoalhaven River. A third party men-
tions that a former Chief Justice’s father was ccjgch-
man to Governor Darling. And “The Oldest Inhabi-
tant,” who sums up the whole matter, says that
“whatever Jimmy Mullins’s early vocation may have
been he made good use of his time, and was such a
devoted son of Mother Church that at his interment
in the family vault in the old Devonshire-street
cemetery the late Archbishop Vaughan attended in
full canonicals, with mitre and crozier, and read the
burial service as the coffin stood on trestles in the
vault. Mullins had been one of the treasurers of St.
Mary’s building fund.”
Thomas Farrenden, old Northern battler
whom Charters Towers has just seen out,
served a seven years’ apprenticeship on the
Victory, Nelson’s flagship. He has been
fossicking and adventuring in Queensland
since 1861, when he was one of a party that
explored the Dawson.
The 14th—Jacka’s battalion —has its own
Cocoa King. Outside the royal circle he is
the Rev. F. AV. Rolland, M.A., a Presby-
terian who has been mentioned in despatches
for gallantry and good work. He is tall and
gaunt, and what he does six days o’ the week
makes them all ready to listen to what he
says on the seventh. An active 40, he con-
siders himself just the right age to make his
way through any kind of flying ironmongery
to hump a kerosene-tin full of hot cocoa to
the lads in the trenches. He started as
captain, is now a major, and, in the opinion
of his hard-bitten flock, is a brevet-archangel.
IF ANYONE CARES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“For the benefit of-those who are interested in such
matters it may be added that Ilindenburg is now
within about 55 miles of Paris.” —Sydney Telegraph.
It may be worth while to remark,
If anyone here cares at all,
That the German’s a bit of a nark
And is feeding ns wormwood and gall.
In fact, though we still can resist
And will probably hit him again,
We are feeling the weight of his fist,
And the size of it gives us a pain.
In case there are some care to know,
We are now in a pretty bad case,
For the brutal and truculent foe
Holds the whiskers that sprout on our face ;
And some may wish even to note,
Though it scarce will occasion surprise,
That the nuisance is cutting our throat
After gouging out one of our eyes.
I may also remark as I pass
That as likely as not very soon
Our graves will be covered with grass,
Which his cows graze on under the moon ;
And a still smaller truth I observe,
With apologies ample and due:
The only troops left in reserve
Are some other tall shirkers and YOU.

Lven during wartime there are lots of things
that pay better than whale-hunting at
Bourke. But this co. has a habit of thriv-
ing on misfortunes. In 1913 it mourned over
an outbreak of smallpox in Sydney and a
prolonged waterside strike in M.L.; next year
there was, of course, the war to grieve over;
if 1915 had sorrows they were like a worm
i’ tin l bud and the directors bore them in
secret; 1916 had the coal strike; and in 1917
there was a three-months’ strike “causing
practically a total cessation of trade and
serious loss to the co.” However, there is
no talk yet of the co. going out of business.
Its profits in the past ill-starred year were
made up as follows: —
Surplus as per P. & L. account . . £87,746
Added to Reserve Fund .. . . 19,433
Ditto to Insurance Fund . . . . 33,466
Total as per table . . . . £140,645
This growth of the reserve fund is presum-
ably profit on the sale of Melbourne’s old
paddle-wheel friend Hygeia “and other
assets.” To what extent the insurance fund
is true reserve, and what proportion of the
£33,466 is true profit, The Bulletin isn’t
prepared to say. The fund may be only an
accumulation of premiums to cover risks
that are still current; all depends on what
risks the co. carries. Last year the co. had
one loss—the tug Nyora, with all hands —
and the insurance fund didn’t seem to suffer;
so it looks as if the insurance fund is a con-
venient stocking to pour profits into. Be-
sides that, there is another whose accretions
haven’t been regarded as profit for the pur-
poses of the table: “Reserve for contingen-
cies, taxation, depreciation of property and
shares in other cos., repairs and mainte-
nance, boilers and renewals, superannuation
fund, etc.” Last year this grew rather less
than usual—only £8122. But as steam-
ships, plant and properties are taken in “at
valuation,” it is pretty clear that deprecia-
tion is allowed for without reference to this
and.
You can get another view of the remark-
able prosperity of this co. from the follow-
ing table: —■

Three years ago assets other than ships,
plant, properties and shares in other cos.
were £245,528. They are now £512,483, an
increase of £266,955. Meantime, of course,
the dividends have been paid. This paper
isn’t prepared to swear that all that £266,955
is profit in excess of the dividends. If it
was it would be equal to an average of nearly
18 p.c. p.a. on the ordinary shares. A few
odds and ends have been sold during the three
years-—the old Hygeia, before mentioned,
and the almost equally patriarchal Burrum-
beet. But meantime the turbine steamer
Nairana has been taken over for the Mel-
bourne-Launceston trade, and no doubt paid
for, and some payments were certainly made
during the period on account of the steamers
Goulburn and Ilebburn, which were added
to the fleet in 1915. The fleet therefore may
be pretty safely regarded as worth quite as
much now as it was at Dec., 1914. Even
the accounts don’t profess that these and the
“shares in other cos.” (mostly, no doubt,
Ilebburn Collieries) have shrivelled more
than £16,846 in the three years. So it
seems fairly safe to say that there isn’t a
great deal of the £266,955 that isn’t surplus
profit made in the past three years. Well,
The Bulletin isn’t going to complain so
long as the right people are taxed to repay
the loans to the scattering of which this
phenomenal profit is mainly due.

Well, it is to be hoped Carmichael makes'
a better fist of recruiting than he did of the
N. S. Wales Gas Bill of which he had charge
five or six years ago. Granted that the Fat-
man’s House mauled it, it was one of the
rawest measures thrown before an Aus-
tralian Parliament for very many years. As
passed it caused trouble which we shall
probably never see the end of. The mischief
it did can’t be undone, because the water
which the law allowed the gas cos. to put
into their capital can’t he pumped out again.
The best the amending Act, passed lately,
could do was to reduce the standard rate
of dividend from 10 p.c. to 8 p.c.; but in
return for that it had to concede to the cos..
in effect, the right to charge a higher stand-
ard price for gas. In short, the cos. had to
give up shadow in exchange for substance—
the right to pay a dividend which they were,
in practice, unable to pay, in exchange for
the power to make larger profits and dis-
tribute them. Chairman G. ,T. Cohen wept
a little over the amending law at the half-
yearly meeting of shareholders. If directors
did that sort of thing, it would have been
much more fitting to call for three cheers.
Certainly the co. shows for the half-year
a profit of only £26,341 and it takes £38,000
to pay a 5 p.c. dividend all round. But note,
first, that owing to the stock-watering sanc-
tioned by the Act, a 5 p.c. div. now is as
good as 71 p.c. was before the principal Act
was passed. But that is not all. Note the
amount that has been written off, ostensibly
to cover depreciation, in addition to the
amounts spent on repairs and renewals: —

So, though nominally the profit*' is £13,000
less than it was in the previous half, it
would have been £13,000 more had only the
same amount been written off. The Bul-
letin does not know what is a fair amount
to write off: but if £34,744 is the fair thing
in one half it would be a hard job to justify
£60,256 in the next half. And, as mentioned
just now, this is exclusive of £55,747 pro-
vided out of revenue during the six months
to pay for repairs, maintenance and renewals
plus £11,719 for repairs, renewals and fixing
and refixing of gas stoves, etc. No doubt
some provision should be made for the decay
and obsolescence of plant, etc., apart from
the regular outlay on repairs and renewals ;
but it is very doubtful whether £lOO,OOO a
year is wanted for the purpose.
But, however you put it, the co. didn’t do
well last half-year; and in view of industrial
trouble couldn’t be expected to. Jt is quite
a. mistake, however, to assume that extra
direct labor costs have made all the differ-
ence in the co.’s profits. This comparison
shows the principal sources of revenue and
the main lines of expenditure:—
1915. 1916. 1917.
Reven ue —
Gas . . .. £377,134 £390,902 £396,107
Meter rents . . 8,954 9,293 8,903
Residuals . . . . 48,807 50,591 05,364

Management, .. 9,392 10,717 11,322
Renewals, etc. . . 64,205 78,989 67,465
The other exes, are rates and taxes, law
charges, lighting and repairing of public
lamps and a few sundries of no consequence.
Compared with 1915 revenue from gas sales
and residuals has increased 9 p.c. The bill
for wages and salaries is 11 p.c. higher; but
coal, oils, etc., have cost no less than 36
p.c. more.
Apart from ordinary trade accounts the
co. owes £344.476 raised on temporary loans;
but it holds £335,000 of N.S.W. Government
debentures, received in payment for resumed
properties. It owes also £1.100,000 on deben-
ture stock. The old works are now out of
use; but the new works are not sufficient
to cope with the prospective requirements,
and there will shortly be an issue of capital
in some form to pay for extensions. As
the new law provides that 8 p.c. may be
paid on all ordinary shares and 7-} p.c. on
pref. capital, there will be no difficulty in
getting the money.

It is not much use going back beyond that,
because as at December 31, 1914, the old
Howard Smith Co. formed two new cos-, Aus-
tralian Steamships, Ltd., and Caledonian Col-
lieries, Ltd., and reconstructed itself. For
some years prior to that date Howard Smith,
Ltd., had £500.000 5 p.c. pref. capital and
£250,000 in ordinaries, and the dividend on
the latter had crept up to 20 p.c., which
was calculated to provoke remark. Before
the new co. was formed assets were revalued
and it was decided to issue (1) £500,000 0
p.c. cumulative pref. capital, these share-
holders thus gaining 1 p.c. on the deal; (2)
£1,250,000 in £1 ordinaries, being five shares
for one; and (3) £250,000 in £1 ordinaries,
but paid only to 45., being one for every one
of the old ordinaries. Thus for the old ordi-
nary £1 share holders got five new ones fully
paid to £1 and one paid to 45., and the direc-
tors were authorised to receive the other 16s.
“either as called up for the purposes of divi-
dend or as bearing interest at such rate as
may be agreed upon.” Nearly 200,000 were
paid up at once, and since then the total
has been brought up to 244,378. The direc-
tors are paying the full dividend on this
capital. Thus the only money put into the
business by shareholders in the new co. is
the £195,50(3 paid on the 244,378 shares;
yet the profits are very much in excess of
those disclosed by the old co. For the four
years prior to the first war year they were:
1910, £123,543; 1911, £98,199; 1912,
£120,048; 1913, £151,455. That the shipping
business in particular has done extraordi-
narily well since the war is certain ; but it is
probable that before 1913 the old co. was
stuffing a good deal of undisclosed profit up
its sleeve. This is proved by the fact that
in 1912 it shook £772,779 out into reserves.
With the development of its numerous
coal properties, the Caledonian has called
for more capital, and “shares in other cos.
(at valuation)” now stand at £2,029.314 as
against £1,704,100 a year ago. Meantime,
however, the “debtors” item has been re-
duced from £337,537 to £174,273. Twelve
months ago Caledonian Collieries owed this
co. £221,006; now this co. owes the other
£28.694. Apart from the shares, the
“debtors” and £190,000 in War Loan, the
co.’s assets total £155,256, consisting of free-
holds and leaseholds, plant and gear and
(about half of the total) stocks of coal and
general stores, these last, no doubt, held in
connection with the co.’s old-established
retail coal business. On the other side the
co. owes £387,281, about half of it on deposit
—chiefly surplus money of the affluent ship-
ping co. Altogether a great money-spinner
this, though interested almost wholly in
businesses which nominally suffer more'than
almost any other from labor disturbances.
It suggests that it isn’t the employers who
pay for these disturbances, but the public.

This co. was formed to take over the coal-
mining business of Howard Smith Ltd., and
make further purchases. Its mines include,
among others, the West Wallsend, West
W r allsend Extended, Waratah, Aberdare and
Aberdare Extended, owned formerly by the
Caledonian Coal Co., of which Howard
Smith’s were principal shareholders and
managing agents; and Howard Smith, Ltd.,
are still practically in that position. A lot
of money has been spent since the co. was
formed, as this comparison shows:—

Development has been proceeding at various
collieries, and very fine additional coal sup-
plies have been proved, especially at Aber-
dare. There have, of course, been the usual
labor distractions; and no doubt the c-o.
"iH watch the result of the attempt which
Associated Smelters, Ltd., is making in S.
Australia to reduce industrial troubles by
supplying employees with holidays on full
pay as a bonus for sticking steadily at work.
Half the little strikes on the coallieids are
due, probably, to the sheer boredom of work-
ing underground without a break. Still,
considering the heavy capitalisation, tin*
Caledonian didn’t do badly last year, thanks
to the increase in the orice of coal; and
the directors thought quite ivell enough of
the prospects to' issue another 113,062
cumulative pref. shares and 226,133 ordi-
naries. Nearly all the ordinariesobelong to
Howard Smith, Ltd.; the prefs., which were
mostly taken by Howard Smith shareholders,
are 6 p.c. cumulative, with the right to an-
other 2 p.c. when there are enough profits
to pay all hands that much. But the prefs.
stop at 8 p.c. The co. has people with a
big pull behind it; and in the coal trade
that counts for a great deal. It handles a
commodity which is going to be wanted more
and more as Australian industry expands,
and it isn’t the sort of business that a com-
petitor can start anywhere. A mine is a
wasting asset certainly; but this co. has
very big reserves. Incidentally it recognises
that when a mine is worked out it is a mere
hole in the ground; hence something (size
unknown) is struck off profits to provide for
the return of capital. So far. however, the
co. has wanted money so badly to develop
its mines that this fund is used in the busi-
ness.

Twelve months'TTgp this co. calculated that
£136,000 was a fair thing to put aside for
War Profits tax on the basis of more or less
authoritative talk up to "that time. But it
didn’t know this Phewsion Government and
it didn’t know the strings that were being
pulled in Melbourne. Since then it has been
shown that this and other cos. which have
made vast sums out of Britain and the
Allies by selling them metals at about 10<>
p.c- above pre-war prices, have been
relieved of war-profit tax; so the £136,000
which this decent co. was prepared to pac-
has been passed back to reserves. This
explains two recent lines added to the table.
Partly because the employees of this co.
have for many years worked under a profit-
sharing scheme, wages being governed or at
least influenced by the price of copper, the
big strike of last year closed the mine for
only one week, and that was through the
coal supplies running out. But subsequently
the poor quality of the coal supplied, coupled
with the impossibility of replacing power
plant which had worn out. affected the out
put. And increased costs affected the profit
still more. The yield from the co.'s own
ore was 6716 tons, and the profit, exclusive
of earnings from investments, but inclusive
of profit on handling purchased ore, was
£126,736, equal to £lB 17s. per ton. The
directors say that “the average price real-
ised for ‘Wallaroo’ copper for 1917 was
£ll6 14s. 2d. at Wallaroo”; and this means
that costs were no less than £97 17s. per
tou. Seeing that copper in normal times is
worth, say, £65, the figure is enough to. give
shareholders a cold feeling along the spine.
Still it is possible to say a few things for
their comfort. (1) Extraction costs have
been altogether abnormal. What this added
to the charges The Bulletin doesn’t know;
probably 30 p.c. or more compared with
1914, when costs were £5l 18s. 3d. (The
average price in that year, by the way, was
£6l 11s. I0d.). (2) It would he a fair thing
to add £51,089 to the profits for the past
year and then show that amount as written
off; for the directors say: “The special ex-
penditure for the year on account machinery,
plant and buildings amounted to £51,089.
and evidently all this has been charged up
to working expenses, because “mines and
smelting works, with buildings, plant aud
machinery.” stand now in the balance-sheet
“as valued at December 31. 1916.” This
£51.089 =£7 12s. per ton of copper. (3)
Besides spending this money on plant, etc..
a fair amount of development was done, and.

The manufacture of the Australian “Skandia” Crude
Oil Engine continues apace, and Nelson & Robertson
report inquiries from mining, dredging and other in-
dustries. The economy in the running cost of these
engines combined with the small amount of labor
required appeals to all power users, and all interested
are invited to forward particulars of their require-
ments. “Skandia” engines are designed for both
industrial and marine work, anrl the stationary type
is unrivalled for pumping, hauling, compressors and
all mining and general work. — Advt.

as general-manager Hancock says in opening
kis report, “the continuance of a favorable
price for copper made it practicable to take tun
advantage of ore-ground which would othei-
wise be unremunerative.” Moonta has a his-
tory of 58 years behind it; and, though it
was the first Australian mining-field to pay
a million in dividends, it isn’t run on the
new copper-mining rule: “Make money while
you can and shut down when you can t,
lienee this policy of working poor ore at a
time when poor ore will pay and leaving
some of the rich ore to work when the poor
couldn’t be looked at alone; likewise the
making of provision in fat times whereby
the poor stuff may be more cheaply worked
in lean times. From several points of view
S. Australia may very well be proud of its
old co.
What it doesn’t do is to tell what its ore
reserves are; if it did, shareholders might
again have that cold feeling about the spine.
But it plugs away, and S. Australia has
almost come to regard the mines as immortal,
though Wallaroo has started to poke about
at very nearly 3000 ft. Moonta’s deepest
working is nearly 2000 ft.; but the ore down
there when last worked was unprofitable, and
the operations in this mine are now at a
much shallower level. In addition to the
mines the co. had on Dec. 31 £421,045 of net
assets (this includes £130,586 of stores) ;
and there are 100,000 shares. At Dec., 1914,
the surplus was £171,973, so in the three war
years the co., besides paying £280,000 in
ilivs., has added £240,072 to its net assets,
plus the very considerable sum spent on
plant. Dividend plus additions made to
deposits and Government stocks amount to
£50,000 more than the capital. There are
not many mines in Australia that can hope
to do things like that after nearly 60 years’
steady exploitation. And this co. wouldn’t
have done it either if the country had a Gov-
ernment that had a soul of its own.
* -X- * *
The Australian newspaper-reader knows a
lot about the country’s strikes. But he
doesn’t know much, as a rule, about the
strike that isn’t listed as a strike, though, on
the whole, perhaps, it is more disastrous.
Hundreds of employers wouldn’t mind if
their men unanimously knocked off toil for
three weeks now and again—say once a year
—so long as they worked regularly the other
49 weeks. It is doubtful, though, whether
in mining and the bulk of the factories the
average attendance is more than 85 p.c. In-
quiries made a little while ago in the
Northern coal district indicated that the
absentees averaged more than 20 p.c. That
is to say, as an average every man knocked
off work every fifth day. In some factories
the figures are worse: in the bottle-making
business, for instance. And there the
irregularity is particularly disastrous because
of the necessity for keeping the heat in the
furnaces.
The same thing occurs in a larger way
at the Associated Smelters’ works at Port
Pirie —the smelting plant that handles the
output of all but two of the Broken Hill
mines. Like other centres where this job
is carried on, Port Pirie isn’t exactly a para-
dise ; and the job itself is mostly hot and
strenuous. This has been one of the diffi-
culties in the way of establishing the spelter
(zinc) industry in Australia and of re-
establishing it in England: actually half of
the employees at the Seaton Carew works
when the war started were Belgians and
Germans. The Associated Smelters have
had an expert on to this problem lately; and,
acting on his advice, the co. has now
adopted a scheme of regular-attendance
bonuses.
It is admitted frankly that the men must
have a break in the monotony of their job.
Half the strikes in the coal trade at any
rate are simply the result of the men’s hun-
gering for a spree—not necessarily on drink ;
just something to displace their boredom.
The men at Pirie are six-shift-a-week and
seven-shift-a-week men. The former are
allowed six absent shifts in six months; the
others eight. Overtime is counted in reduction
of the absences: for instance, if a man works
16 hours o.t. in the six months it is equal
to two days, and if he has been absent six
days it counts as only four. Absence on
sick leave is disregarded; but there must be
a medical certificate —obtainable without fee.
Absence for a day without leave is counted
as absence for a day and a half. Those who
go through the six months with less than
six (or eight) absences, calculated as above,
are to be entitled to one week’s leave on
full pay. Most of the men are seven-shift-
a-week hands at 11s.; that means for these
men a bonus of £4 2s. 6d. (they get time and
a half for Sunday). Each man will be given
liberal notice of the time when he can take
his leave (his convenience will be consulted)
and he will be handed his bonus before the
leave starts. Further, in order that the leave
may do him (and the works, of course) the
greatest possible amount of good, the co. is
establishing a permanent holiday camp on
the other side of the gulf, in a picked posi-
tion, and accommodation will be provided
there for the families of the men and for
the supply of necessaries at cost price. The
scheme is experimental; and the result of its
operation will be watched with great inter-
est throughout Australia.

“Mustard Gold”: One time Westralia
rushed ’Murkan mining men to manage its
mines, and particularly those of the Golden
Mile, but the breed is not numerous there
now. Only one is visible at present along
the Boulder belt —Vail, of the Lake View
and Star, who, years ago, was brought from
Yankeeland by W. J. Loring. He formerly
managed the Lancefield, which utterly failed
to be prosperous while worked by the old
co. and its imported bosses. Under purely
Australian management it has, however,
beaten all mechanical and treatment troubles,
and is now declaring profits for the Moss-
Ridgway-Hamilton syndicate, which took it
over after liquidation. Really the ’Murkan
was in demand chiefly because he was a
whale on accommodating the market. Lake
Views, as an example, soared once to nearly
£3O per share on returns that touched
30,0000 z. one month as the result of manager
Callaghan’s raids on the rich shoots of the
mine. Callaghan eventually left with a bag
full of money, and the View, being pretty
well denuded of its high-grade ore, has since
been a gradually-diminishing proposition.
Callaghan’s departure was the commence-
ment of the Yankee manager exodus. The
Australian has proved himself quite as skilled
in handling a mine, and may be relied upon
not to slog out flash yields for speculative
purposes, wherefore he gets most of the min-
ing jobs going nowadays. The four big mines
of the Mile are all managed by Australians —
Hamilton, the Great Boulder; Sutherland,
the Horseshoe ; McDermott, the Ivanhoe ; and
Black, the Kalgurli.
* * * *
Westralian Mines Department recently
issued a list of 3000-odd abandoned leases
which had yielded nearly 3,00G,0U00z. line
gold. Many of these, worked by cos. and
syndicates years ago, were equipped with
costly plants. All that remains are water-
logged shafts, caved-in workings and old iron.
Some of the derelicts are reckoned to be
worth a further trial. In order to give tribu-
tors and prospectors a chance in similar cases
in the future it is suggested that the Gov-
ernment should have the right to purchase
the winder on any show about to be aban-
doned, and so provide access to the workings
for anybody who may become interested.
In the case of the Boulder Persever-
ance, for instance, it is considered that
it would be folly for the Govern-
ment to allow the co. when it shuts down to
strip the lease of the hoisting plant and
leave no means of communication with the
underground workings.
* * * *
To the end of 1917 Westralia paid
£26,718,125 in dividends out of gold won.
* * * *
Central and West Boulder, now chiefly
interested in Nigerian tin ventures, issued
an annual report in London the other day.
The co. has nothing for shareholders at
present, but hopes to give them a taste later
on. Meantime an appeal is being made for
funds to finance development. A few tribu-
tors are at present rooting and burrowing
in the co.’s Kalgoorlie property, and when
the war is over the Board promises to try
to further liven up things. The accounts
show a loss for the year of about £lOOO.
Pumping is the chief feature of operations
at Westonia just now; mining and treatment
having become matters of secondary import-
ance. For some weeks the 385 ft. and 480 ft.
levels o'f the Edna May have been flooded,
with the result that the Edna May yield for
March is likely to be the lowest the co. has
had for some years. Deeps apparently does
not intend to sink its main shaft further.
No doubt the ore below the 566 ft. level will
be mined by means of the winze which has
been transformed into an internal shaft.
Such a system of mining necessitates double
handling of ore, but Deeps has some rich
ore below the 566 ft. level and apparently
does not mind the extra cost of getting it.
Regarding water troubles, Deeps is well
placed, as Edna May and Central keep
the water off its workings. If, however, the
water be permitted to rise in either show, the
outlook for Deeps will be depressing. At
present the position at Westonia is that Edna
May is stuck at 385 ft. level, Central at
321 ft. and Consolidated at 210 ft., while
Deeps, at present, is able to mine ore from
the bottom of the winze below 7 566 ft.
“Oof Bird” : For the 75th time the Wes-
tralian Government is asked to do some-
thing towmrds the suppression of lying min-
ing reports. There’s no doubt of the neces-
sity, for instances of misrepresentation are
constantly occurring. Some time ago I met
on the Perth railway-station two directors
of a much-advertised Melbourne-owmed show,
and both were astonished that I did not
know the manager, Captain Blank, or his
works. They lauded his technical ability,
declaring that he was one of the best mining
men in the West. Finally I was urged to go
and see the mine. I did, and found the pro-
perty, which was reported to have dividends
in sight and only needed the completion of
the partly-erected mill to get them out, to
be a 24-acre block on which one small pros-
pecting shaft had been sunk and a few short
costeens dug. So far as I could see the
show hadn’t a ton of payable ore ready to
be crushed. As for Captain Blank, he
proved to be a former skipper of a small
coastal boat, and had never worked near a
mine before. The venture was soon after-
wards abandoned, and the Captain went
back to the sea. Asked how the Board came
to put such a man in charge of the property,
one of the directors explained: “Well we
wanted to make a market, and Blank was
recommended to us as a fellow who would
help us.”
Victor Leggo, of Bendigo, has taken over
the Transvaal mine at Southern Cross
(W.A.). He proposes to work the show
mainly for arsenic, and grab all the gold he
can as well. An outlay of £20,000 is con-
templated, and when operations are in full
swing as much arsenic as the Commonwealth
knows what to do with is expected to be
produced. Some leases at Randalls, which
turned out unprofitable gold-mines, are also
to be given a trial as poison producers.
* * * •
Kalgurli (W.A.) lingers on. Speaking
at the recent annual meeting chairman Staf-
ford said: “We cannot have much more pro-
fitable ore in sight, but latest accounts from
the mine show that a crosscut at the 420 ft.
level has reached a point at which the dia-
mond-drill indicated payable ore, and has
revealed 12ft. of payable stone.” The extent
of the find, however, has yet to be deter-
mined. Although the co. will have made no
profit for the year ended this month, it will
be called upon to pay income tax amounting
to about £45,000.
* * * *
Devon, Linden (W.A.), is winzing on
stone worth 151 s. per ton. And yet it may
not be a mine. The office measures up 140 ft.
of shoot, and crushings give £3 15s. per ton,
of which 465. is in the concentrates and
tailings. Even if a bit has to be shaved off
for loss in treatment, it looks as if the co.
has a fair prospect. But eyes must be kept
off the winze ; also further cash must be put
into the till. Imagine a manager having to
admit that he has been so hard up that, when
men were available, he could not put them
on to speed up development!
* * * *
111-luck sticks to the mines on the “Blue”
formations at Bendigo. Central Blue quite
fails at depth, though some fair grade stone
is still available in the shallow levels. Red,
White and Blue Extended, to the north, is
trying to get a shoot anywhere between 800
and 1020 feet. At the bottom the legs of
the ’ saddles are thin, but the presence of
minerals and a color or two justify some
rising, which is being done. Spurry country
exists at the 960 ft. level, but the quartz is
small and unprofitable. Better-defined for-
mations are being opened up at 800 ft. off the
east crosscut, where rising is being done to
test the cap and the west leg. Even small
cheer of this sort is very welcome nowa-
days at Bendigo.
Hope still blossoms in the ample chest of
George Buchanan over Ajax North, Dayles-
ford (Vic.), and also anchors Arthur Vickery
and Dal Dalrymple to the Board table. The
stone broken has been averaging 28s. —just
enough to keep the co. off the call list. Most
of the values lie in flat makes above No. 7
level, as the vertical formations there and
underfoot are patchy and poor. Manager
Hansen intends to slog out into new country
between Nos. 5 and 8 levels to see if the
slates there have hidden treasure. He is
also going at the eastern country in the north
end of the mine. There he thinks his chance
of cutting payable stone is good. With such
poverty at depth in Daylesford it takes a
big heart to make a vigorous prospector.

prove that as the lead deepens tin contents
ease. That loss is at present being made
up by the splendid market for tin. Conse-
quently the Gibbs-Bright crowd pouches 4s.
in divs. for the half-year.
Briseis (Tas.) had a low record for the
December quarter of 63 tons oxide against an
average of about 90 tons for the previous
three terms of last year. Converted into
metallic, the mine output for the year was
240 tons, worth £56,737, or £236 per ton.
In 1916, the co. won 331 tons metallic tin,
which it sold for £60,643, or £lB3 ss. per
ton. The difference of £53 per ton must
have got Lindesay Clark out of a tight
corner, and it incidentally shows the de-
pendence of the mine on the jump in prices.
After June or July, Clark will be delving
in his new paddock towards Ringarooma
Hill. His side-show, the Wallace gold-
dredging leases, in Victoria, yielded during
1917 gold worth £14,893, or £5OOO less than
in 1916. It is an open secret that the
agreement with the vendor was such a snap
for him that the Briseis has never made
much out of the enterprise.

Sydney, April 1, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
The G.-G., with Lady Helen, the sub-regal
Davidsons and a galaxy of political splendor,
strolled about the ring enclosure, led by pre-
sident Sam Hordern, on the opening day of
the Easter show. Lords and ladies of still
higher degree in the Beef peerage simultane-
ously . made their solemn pilgrimage round
the big green sward. Not without protest,
of course. Our best hulls resented the vul-
garity of the proceedings and ungallantly
made a toss or two in the direction of Lady
Helen’s lorgnette. The staff—Haskett Smith
and Clifford, reinforced by the State Gover-
and Clifford—threaded their way gin-
gerly amongst the wild animals and their
bellows. George Fuller and his tall wife,
Minister Beeby, Joynton Smith and officials
of the Agricultural Society, these last hung
with symbols of their magnificence, ambled
after the Distinguished Persons.
Evie Morton, taking her steed smartly
around in the amateur equestrienne race, was
an easy first. Dolly Fogg caught the judge’s
eye as No. 1 in another flat competition—
the “Walker and Hall” event. Amongst the
nippers on horseback Una Nilson won a
special. One girl, mounted on J. R. Glen’s
jumper Wellington, came a nasty cropper
at the sod wall; then, after a breathless
moment, the crowd cheered as she got up
and walked off the ground.
This year Alice McCulloch, the Victorian
amateur high-jumper, and her handsome nag
are not clearing the show-ground timber.
Neither is Mrs. Stace amongst those who
also jump. For once the plucky cross-
country horsewoman admits to being'unequal
to the strain, and her firm seat on the side-
saddle—which she maintains is safer for
women over the hurdles —is missing for the
first time for 20 years or so.
A Mosman girl has discovered how to
become her Excellency. Her husband, who
is here now on leave, is Military Governor
of Jerusalem. This war-time his Excel-
lency is Captain Eric Hyman ; and he took
advantage of his brief return to Sydney to
capture and carry off a Mosman girl. Of
course, I don’t suppose that Captain and
Mrs. Eric Hyman will be called their Excel-
lencies, even in the ancient Hebrew lan-
guage ; but her job will be quite as nerve-
racking as that of our State Governor’s wife.
Captain Saltmarche, of the King’s Rifles,
and Captain Stanham, of the Buffs, the new
young gentlemen in attendance on Governor
Davidson, have arrived. His first pick—from
the Coldstreams —were recalled to the West-
ern Front. For British soldiers, like our
own hard-pressed Billjims, must go back to
the slogging almost as soon as the “wounded
and in hospital” notice comes down.
Verbrugghen stepped ashore last week,
after a trip, partly in search of professional
talent, to U.S.A. The talent couldn’t be
cajoled to come at the‘price. The director —
who is just getting his complexion back after
being a very sea-sick voyager—adds “as I
expected !” Then why the expense of going
to look for it? Anyhow, the little thread of
musical fervor got a warm welcome at Good
Friday night’s classic concert in the Conserva-
torium when he stepped into the conductor’s
pen. The highbrows drank in the solemn
Bach Magnificat (no applause till the end,
by special request), the soloists being Philip
Wilson, Marjorie Beeby (both tenor and
contralto were most effective), Dulcie Hux-
table, Rosa Alba, Dorothy Toppin and Nel-
son Illingworth. A huge audience breathed
freely in the interval after the final Amen
to the Gloria Patri. The G.-G. and Lady
Helen, with a Help or two, were in the
front seats and got the breeze from the con-
ductor’s coat-tails. Verbrugghen threshes
every quarter-ounce of music out of his team,
and in the doing of it gyrates like a willy-
willy.
While sub-regal ladies wear their skirts
well down over their ankles —this was
noticed during their perambulation in the
Show ring—our Most Expensive people still
give short shrift to their garments. At
Saturday’s races silk stockings made a great
parade, with hems reaching to the feminine
calves —“heifers” in some cases, a big Show
exhibitor insisted. But the shadow of the
Frightfulness in France fell upon the
ordinary woman's love of frills. Winter coats
and skirts —possible on an exquisite autumn
afternoon—and the last muslins of summer
were, on the whole, sedate, and without the
wild millinery of a few years back. Hats
are wide or narrow, sugar-loaf or pudding-
basin in design. Coats and skirts in the
lightest colors are heavily frogged with mili-
tary braid, or weighted with fur in black or
dark brown.
All hail the blouse! For those whose
slender lines can let the lacey drapery flutter,
as it were, all over their frontispiece, it is
an elegant garment. In the members’ stand
a fair-haired young woman in a wonderfully-
cut blue satin striped skirt, a cream lace
blouse and the neatest of small roundabout
hats, with more blue satin stripe swathed over
its crown, achieved one of the most charming
outfits. The lady was a stranger, but every-
one wanted her skirt! Two pretty Mel-
bourne sisters, Elizabeth (cream) and Myra
Fell (fawn), walked the lawn with father.
The charmers’ uncle, John Jamieson, of
Temora, down for race-week, had his best
girl to look after. She’s Mrs. Paterson, a
good-looking young widow, who intends to
make bachelor John the happiest of men
some time in June.
For slender ankles no lady on the lawn
could beat the Maoriland belle, Desert Gold,
as she flashed past the winning-post in the
Autumn Stakes! Owner Lowry watched his
beauty run away from the field, and add
another nugget or so to patriotic funds.
Then he had to dodge the rush of congratu-
lations. From Queensland A. H. Whitting-
liam and Dr. and Mrs. Connolly came to the
carnival. Osborne Norris and his wife, Mrs.
A. E. Hughes (in a dream frock of creamy
cloth flecked with brown), and the Tom
Lipscoinbes were amongst the keen sporting
crowd. Mrs. Gaffney—a sister .of Marie
Narelle —in one of the delectable ivory-
tinted tailor-mades, had cousin Edie Ileffer-
nan (Junee) to chat to. Mrs. Floyd brought
a pretty daughter; and the Philip Mortons,
Mrs. Leslie Macdonald, L. K. S. Mackinnon
and E. L. Baillieu, Mrs. Jim McMaster (in
a demure black tailor-built), and half the
town that wasn’t fighting in France or
mourning at home or getting dog-tired at
the overflowing Show spent Easter Satur-
day at Randwick.
G.-G. Fairguson unveiled an actors’ roll
of honor in the Association’s club rooms in
Elizabeth-street the other day. The list
mentions about 70 names, with Dartnell,
V.C., killed in action, in the lead.
Captain J. T. Rolls —he who pilots the
Niagara across the Pacific —has fine reason
to be proud of the ship’s patriotic funds. In
the last two years £31,891 has been handed
over—collected chiefly at concerts and auc-
tion sales. There’s a Niagara hut now in
France, and recently £BOO was gathered in
for its upkeep.
This year the hitherto unremarkable
Women Painters’ Show is remarkable for two
virile oil exhibits.
Unheralded and
bearing an unknown
signature —“K.
Thynne”—they are
survivors of a col-
lection which, so it
is gravely said, was
for the greater part
cast out because
the frames —heavy
wooden ones—were
frowned on by the
committee. So we
are left with “An
English Farmer” and
“An Italian Study”
to represent the art
of Kate Thynne of
Brisbane.
Years ago, this
Queensland girl spent 12 months with Julian
Ashton. “During 10 years’ study and travel
in Europe,” she says now, “I did not meet
a finer teacher!” Leaving Sydney the
Bananaland woman got to work in Paris in
the Delacluse and Colorossi ateliers, with
summer sketching tours in Brittany. Then
on to Italy. “With a party of eight art
students I shared rooms in the old monas-
tery of San Antonio at Tivoli —a historic
place built on the site of Horace’s villa.
Rome, Naples, Perugia, Assissi and Venice
followed. After that some months of study
in Florence. Then back to England to a
flat in Chelsea.” Here the Australian
joined classes at the London Art School and
worked there for three years, the teachers
being Brangwyn, Swan and other leading
London artists, and did some study besides
at the Chelsea Polytechnic. With summer,
came the Brangwyn sketching class to Brit-
tany ; then to Holland with Alex. Robin-
son’s students; and to St. Ives and Newlyn
in Cornwall. In this home of the fisher-
folk she worked and painted for months,
sharing a studio with a Canadian friend, and
joining the classes of Stanhope-Forbes. So
the Brisbane artist sums up 10 years of
arduous study in the world’s most famous
art centres. To those with eyes to see it all
materialises in that Italian, head hanging
to-day in the Sydney Education Building.
Lawrence Campbell is delighting the Corn
Bags who wander into St. James’s Hall
these nights. “The Sentimental Bloke is
the cheerful feast he offers them.
John Shirlow, just nominated as Associ-
ate of the Royal Society of Painter-etchers,
London, is over having
a holiday glimpse of
the city in which he
sees endless “sub-
jects.” Though the
Victorian Art Gal-
lery has never
shown any signs of
recognising his ex-
istence, John’s fame
as an etcher is now
more than all-Aus-
tralian, though Shir-
low, most modest of
men, is still wonder-
ing how the British
Society came to hear
about his hobby.
A student of long
ago under Folings-
by, and later of
McCubbin, he was regarded as a youth with
a kink when he introduced red-clmlk for
life studies (now it’s a vogue) to the earlier
Victorian art classes. In 1893 Melbourne
bought the Whistler etchings. They got
into Shirlow’s blood. He began reading up
the process, made the press, the tools and
the etching-grounds and got to work, using
the backs of obsolete copper-plates. His
hours at this task were usually from G a.m.
till the breakfast-bell rang. There were also
Saturday afternoons and (hush!) many
Sundays in which he gradually perfected his
art. In working hours he is one of the Mel-
bourne City Council’s electrical engineers,
and in odd moments he is examiner in draw-
ing and art at Melbourne Uni. For the pur-
pose of this little picture he faced Judith
Fletcher’s lens during his Easter trip to
Sydney.
“Tit Bits”—snacks from this and that—
filled the Repertory on Saturday night, and
repeated its financial success on Monday.
With seats from 10s. Gd. to a guinea, there’s
plenty of profit from this amateurs’ bright
little show for Light Horse and Camel Corps
Funds. Brigadier Jack Antill brought some
merry men from Menangle (the camp is
likely to be closed almost immediately) to
line the stairs and make a manly background
on the stage. Graceful Mrs. Owen Dibbs was
chief warbler in a patriotic chorus. An un-
certain spot-light brought a wondering flight
of tiny white moths into the darkened
theatre, and occasionally plunged a star into
total darkness. Otherwise, the snacks went
very well. Mrs. Buckland, Barbara Gordon,
Mrs. Leslie Walford —in costumes that in-
cluded a 40-guinea glitter of black and silver
—the Macarthur twins. Captain McVean,
M.C., Gunner Tony Street and Bertha Scott
(a dainty vision in cream and gold) were
in the highly-ornate programme.
Willie Harper and his lady have called
in on the way home to Vancouver. He’s a
son, you know, of Robert Harper, the old
Melbourne merchant, who has just had a
“golden wedding.”
Brisbane has been preparing to welcome
a lieut.-colonel of 33, who is coming back
with the D. 5.0., won, with a mention in
despatches, at Pozieres- He is A. C. Fewtrell,
of the Engineers, the Mining Corps (where he
had Prof. David under him), the Pioneers,
and the Anzac Light Railways. Though a
Townsville boy, with a dad in Brisbane, be-
fore the war he was an engineer on the N.
S. Wales railways.
A Svdney woman, Mrs. Herbert Nelson,
writing from Los Angeles, the film-city
where daughter Gwen is acting for the Fox
movies, mentions that “Enid Bennett was
married yesterday morning (Feb. 25) to
Fred Niblo.”
In the midst of the general uproar there’s
a cafe ehantant on Thursday (April 4) in
the Wentworth Hotel. Cash goes to the
Alexandra Hospital for Sick Kiddies.
“Down for the Show,” James Lee, of
Larras Lake, now, at 87, the last of the
sons of that fine old pioneer, William Lee,
of Kelso. William Lee helped to make the
first road across the Blue Mountains, and,
being for his great services given a grant,
took Kelso. Looking round on his family
of boys he soon wanted to have more elbow
room for them, so he went out to the Bogan
—and was ordered back lest the blacks
should devour him. Of all the big Lees—a
half-dozen or more—only one went off the
land. He was a barrister. And even he
loved his stable better than his library.
“Dad” Bailey acquired a curio lately—
“our selection” done by Miss Kelman, assist-
ant in Nelson Illingworth’s studio. No, it
isn’t a piece of statuary; it is done in odds
and ends of chips and cardboard and cork
and I don't know what besides; and when
you see Dad at the sliprails and Mum in
the doorway and Dave and the others about
the place, you quite expect to hear the
irascible old man impart valuable informa-
tion about the goodfornothingness of things
in general.
Away back in the early seventies of last
century, E. P. Lindsay, a young Canadian
six-footer who had had a taste of soldiering,
landed in Sydney, and looking round for a
job enlisted in the Permanent Artillery. He
reached a sergeant’s stripes, and then in
1881 he took a billet as drill instructor and
general disciplinary official at the old King’s
School, Parramatta. The job suited
Lindsay; headmasters came and went
—six of them all told —but “Clobs” stayed
on as a fixture, giving pack-drill to embryo
colonels and generals, punishing budding
M’s.L.A. and squatters for surreptitious
smoking, and checking the amours of future
parsons and judges with the flappers who
hung round the school fences. Meanwhile
he saw one of his old boys (Stacy Waddy,
now chaplain with the A.I.F. in Palestine)
come back as his headmaster. “Clobs” taught
his boys soldiering to some purpose; over
500 of them, ranging from brigadier-general
to private, have helped to keep Australia’s
end up in the present war. The other day,
after 37 years in the job, he reckoned it was
up to someone else; but to a few thousand
old boys the school won’t seem the same place
without him.
The 30th Battalion bees hive in the Suttor
Pavilion dining-rooms during the coming
year; which means that, from Easter on,
they will be ready to feed the public there
whenever there’s anything to lure the multi-
tude to the Show Ground. For the Easter
dash they’ve engaged a first-class chef —a
returned soldier.
At the Show this year the committee of
the Surry Hills Free Kindergarten is run-
ning an exhibition and sale of useful work
done by tiny hands. The kiddies eagerly
added their ounces to this punch, whose
object is to knock up a new Kindergarten
building in the crowded “Hills” area.
Writing from France about the desperate
loss of life amongst the young children,
chiefly from malnutrition owing to war
conditions, Miss Soubeiran says :
Here (in Paris) there is an American nurse who
speaks of the wonderful results obtained from dried
milk, i.e., cow’s milk of the best quality dried on
hot cylinders. The discoverer is a Frenchman with
a rather German-sounding name —Auerbacher. The
U.S.A. nurse is full of faith and has a backing of
rich friends, so she starts at once, to use her own
expression, “with 25 beds and the sickest babies she
can find.”
Amongst new knights on the other side is
Captain Connor Guthrie, of the Grenadier
Guards. Badly damaged in action (1915),
he is now representative of the Director of
Transports in the U.S.A. His wife was Eily
McEacliarn, daughter of the late Malcolm,
Australian shipping man.
In Vancouver they’ve got a New Idea for
raising comforts funds. It’s called a Travel
Dance. Several householders lend their
homes. Each is a.station. The guests take
single or round-trip tickets. The latter are
punched by. “porters” in the professional
way at each station. The mangled remains
with most holes in it is the prize-winner, of
course. There are musical titbits on the
journey. Sydney women are occasionally at
their wits’ end to hit up a novelty. Why not
a Travel Dance —say at Darling Point, with
a prawn narty, at so much a head ? The tails
could be left for puss.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

**The Instrument of To-day that supersedes the Gramophone of
Yesterday.”
This splendid musical instrument is an extraordinary improve-
ment giving unlimited pleasure and entertainment. Appreciation
intensifying the more the VOCALION is heard, now replaces
the ready tiring of the indifferent music coming from the ordinary
talking machine. You have a constant delight if the VOCA-
LION is in your home. All ages, both sexes, are ever eager
to sit and enjoy the excellent entertainment it provides.
Easily played—and this is the only instrument with the patent

My Dear Yarrie, —
Apple Islanders visiting here are simply
raving about their Governor folk. The new-
comers are so. friendly that they enter witli
enthusiasm into even the very insular affairs
of the Tasmanians. They also put a dash
into their ways that gives delightful shocks to
the prim State. The Newdigates have two
daughters, with the varied names of Lucia
and Susan. Susan is the young one. At a
recent Government House party all the
electric lights were suddenly doused. His Ex.
exclaimed forcibly and hurriedly in a stage
whisper something that sounded remarkably
like “D ! That’s that Susan again!”
And sure enough it was the merry youngster
who had managed to find the main switch.
Some of the visiting feminines of the
Commerce Congress have hurried home to
search for mother’s etiquette l book (1859
edition). Governor Stanley, at his own gar-
den party, wore his hat all through tea-
time; and it was a soft grey hat, too. Also
(sh-ii-h!) he did it with his elbows dug
into the table and the aggressive hat pulled
down over his eyes.
Freda Sternberg drops a line from N’York :
Since Eve bit the apple there’s never been more
conversation about food than can be heard now in
America. “Tucker talk” has been with me across
the Pacific. On the boat the monotony was relieved
by a Chidley disciple—Ernest Darling. Clad in a
fish net, he spoke in phonetics, pleading with his
fellowmen to “eat only when hungry, and mostly ov
unkookt food, nzing litl or no salt (a klogger
and stifner),” At Honolulu around a luncheon
table in an American home food was talked in
major and minor tones. I’ve never seen such food
as appeared at that table. And disappeared, too.
Here in New York every hotel, restaurant, cafe —-
and they are legion—implores its patrons in the
boldest-typed poster to observe the wheatless, meat-
less, baconless days. Somehow it reminds me of
the Hebrew Day of Atonement. Every good Jew
fasts 24 hours on that date, and thinks all the time
about the food he’s to cat when the sun goes down.
Food seems to be quite as sacred to the Yankee as
the dollar.
Freda, who lias resumed her private pencil-
ling for Melba, was just off to California
with her Queen; when that tour jvas over
the Victorian girl hoped to push into jour-
nalism in N’York.
Probably the proudest stepfather-in-law
in Melbourne to-day is Arthur Collier, whom
a former generation knew as a lightweight
boxer. Years agone, a widow with two little
girls, Mrs. Collier used to keep a popular
tavern at Hamilton, chief town of the West-
ern District. After Collier came into the
family they all moved up to Melbourne, and
when the "girls grew up Billy Watt chose
one of them to be the future Acting Prime
Ministress.
From a friend of ours:—
I was staying with a Castlemaine girl, when one
morning a much-burdened baby toiled up the dusty
roacl to pay a morning call on his aunties. On inves-
tigating his cuddled plaything it was found that
baby had been to his father’s most sacred storehouse
of treasures and had captured daddy’s first public
speech, printed on white satin, the gift of admiring
fellow-townsmen. Baby and the manuscript were
both restored to their proper abiding places, but the
worst may be feared from Baby’s early choice of
playthings. And I didn’t tell you until now that
dadda is Harry Lawson, new Premier of Victoria,
Melbourne lost one of its best-known
horsewomen when Brig.-General Johnston’s
1 ducky wife—a slight blonde, quite unlike the
typical equestrienne—was thrown at Caul-
field, receiving a knock on the head that
robbed her of consciousness which was never
regained. After negotiating hundreds of
fences the lady met her fate while jogging
along a quiet suburban road. Hubby, who
only recently returned from France, has just
been appointed Administrator of the cap-
tured Hun possessions in the Pacific. Before
her marriage to the military furniture-mag-
nate Mrs. Johnston was Margaret Hobson.
Captain C. E. Hobson, master of the Oak-
lands Hounds, is her brother.
Mrs. George Johnston’s death was probably
due to her retention of the side-saddle: when
her nag shied and she came down the poor
lady was helpless among the flying hoofs.
This is the second fatal accident in the ranks
of the Equestrian Club. Arthur Clarke was
the previous victim.
Lieut.-Colonel Sommens, who is official
guardian of game and fish, announces that
lie is going to make himself unpleasant to
any of us who Haunt egret feathers. The
beautiful birds are in danger of becoming ex-
tinct, and the nestlings suffer terribly when
the parent birds are shot. The amending
Act prohibiting the wearing of the feathers
came into force at the beginning of the
year, but no prosecutions have taken place
up to now. At Flemington a few weeks ago
many egret decorations were visible; in a
number of cases double plumes were on show,
which means that two birds had been
slaughtered to disfigure one hat.
The widow Staughton gave a great party
at the National League club rooms. ‘•Fight-
ing Mac” talked of war, and Mrs. Fleming—
the newly-imported expert in clinics—talked
of babies. The hostess always encourages
drawing-room music, So Miss Krorne, Jessie
Smith, Dollie Hayes and Minnie Peck helped
with a programme.
Chilian Consul Burros got his auction
fete going at last in the Town Hall on
Wednesday, and all the precious overdressed
Dolls of the Nations were knocked down to
the highest bidder. Barros is so shy a
bachelor that he always provides himself
with a chaperone. Mrs. Davidson helped
him out this time.
Sandringham got busy on its Boomerang
Fete last Saturday. .uelrose-street was
closed to all except foot traffic and followed
the Oollin's-street lead in making a block
bazaar. There was a fancy-dress procession
and decorated motor-cars. Dr. Pat Leary
Carried off a first prize, and Champion ran
some tableaux in the open Mr. Pots of
money are being counted up for Our Boys’
funds.
Lesley Madden is nreparing a lingerie
show now for Adelaide. She lias some preci-
ous Fortuna garments—priceless gold-sten-
cilled things in ninon and crepe from Ven-
ice. It has been a sad and weary month for
Lesley. Her partner was forced into hospi-
tal for an operation, so all the work fell on
the girl who had just been bereft of her
beloved dad.
David Etheridge has bought Questa, one
of the St. Kilda Esplanade mansions that
have been roared out of homeliness by the
beach shows. He is remodelling the place
into flats, with a big foodery attached and
some cunning Maryanntic device so that
tenants may avoid the wash-up tin.
Women in Melbourne are trying to work
up a club for clerks and stenographers—a
place with dining-, reading- and sitting-rooms,
where they can feed away from the noise
and rush of city cafes and have a place to
rest and brush up between office hours and
evening frivols. There is also a strong move-
ment in favor of a gymnasium. Miss Hale
and Miss Doolin, 413 Collins-street, are
anxious to hear from probable supporters.
The A.N.A. has been' having its annual
series, of debates —at Bendigo this year. The
affair lasted through three solid days of
talk (from 9 a.m. to midnight each day)
and wound up with a smoke-o in the base-
ment of the Town Hall! One of the import-
ant Natives is Morris Phillips. This ener-
getic young man, not having missed a single
hour of the oratory, is so exhausted that he
is off on a motor-trip through the Western
District. By the way, in spite of his pride in
his wife, he absolutely refuses to be known
as ‘‘the husband of the authoress, Ray
Phillips.”
Mr. D. H. “Canadian” Ross blushes to
find himself in the Christmas number of
“The Log.” which is the occasional journal
of the Circumnavigators Club of N’York.
Having been asked to send along a typically
Australian item to this elegant and select
publication, he forwarded a copy of some
shocking old Bulletin verses, entitled “The
Great Australian Adjective”—and there it
is, with its glaring omissions of unprintable
language, advertised as furnished by Mr.
Ross!
The villagers of Frankston have been the
first to move in the matter of a memorial
to the late John Madden. A committee has
been formed and the hat is to be sent round
Victoria.
The suave Eles, who represents Italy in
a beautiful costume, has been promoted from
Cavaliere to Officer, which means, I am told,
that he will be “Dr. Eles” and his party
dress will be more ravishing than ever.
A crowd of cultured matrons and misses
assembled at the Lyceum Club the other
evening to extend the glad hand to Dr. Con-
stance Ellis, just back from the Wilson
States, Avhere she has been studying the most
up-to-date methods of dismembering the
human body in a friendly way.
Of course, my dear, such things are quite
common in war-time Blighty, but here the
sight of a girl driving a taxi is novel enough
to turn our heads. This Pamela Brown,
linguist, musician and business girl, pre-
ferred the wind and the weather to an office.
She felt the lure of the wheels, and, fol-
lowing the example of her pal Alice Ander-
son. who runs her car for hire in the Heales-
ville hills, she catches city passengers who
are looking for bargains in taxi-rides. Eve
Waddington. the Gippsland girl who once
drove a hansom through Melbourne for fun,
is eclipsed at last. But Pamela’s taxi will
not be available for the frisky evening jaunts
in which these vehicles delight.
Some Melbourne women, who honestly
believe they're charitably-disposed, still have
a bad habit of forcing professional musicians
to give their services for nothing, though
the practice was frowned on very blackly by
King and Queen over a year ago. The poor
pros, are scared to refuse, though, because
Mrs. Awfully liich and Mrs. Neverworked
may be offended and never engage them
again for their At Homes; and that’s what
makes it such a cowardly trick.
Adelaide rings up :
The Commonwealth Club met on Tuesday to fare-
well its founder and first secretary, S. 11. Skipper,
who exchanged law for the A.I.F. some time ago.
Ho was the Club’s hon. sec. from 1910, when he
launched it with 100 members, to the date of his
enlistment, when its membership stood at 000. J.
Hayter Heed has taken up the pen he dropped.
The South Aus. Soldiers’ Fund has evolved a
scheme whereby it hopes that members of the A.I.F.
and the Australian Naval Forces may be insured in
the event of death occurring during their war ser-
vice. The next Australia Day appeal, which is
fixed for July, will be for the specific purpose of
establishing the insurance fund.
Three Military Crosses have fallen to the sons
of W. A. Horn, once a well-known Adelaidean. One
of the winners is in the Lancers ; the other two in
the Tt.F.C. Two more brothers are also at the Front.
Not a bad record for one family.
The Heturned Soldiers’ Association’s building
fund appeal—booked for April—has had a generous
start of £lOOO from Svd. Kidman. Friday’s Hutton
Day brought in about £l5OO towards furnishing
the hostel which the State War Council is building
at the rear of the Cheer-up Hut.
The finalised accounts of the March Show reveal
a loss of nearly £250, and an attendance of 11,000
less than in the palmy days before the war. Adelaide
for Decent Feeling.
Captain F. T. Bruce, who resigned his post as
sec. to the State Recruiting Committee to make way
for a returned soldier, has been made vice-chair-
man of that body in place of Agent-General Lucas.
The star item on the programme of Good Friday's
sacred concert was De Giorgio’s “Ave Maria.” sung
by Clara Serena. Time was when De Giorgio was
well known to musicians here, and his old friends
rallied up to hear his work. The composer’s profits
go to the Italian Red Cross Society.
Mr. Gale, appointed second in command of Syd-
ney’s new’ grammar school, is an old St. Peter's Col-

sion to inquire,” given him by the S.A. Government,
has been a key to many places: he has been over
some of the Fleet, has been taken down in a sub-
marine (not in the way that you and I have been
taken down in a swell liner), and has flown across
from England to British headquarters in France. As
to personal damage—he had his bedroom window-
broken by a bomb.
News from Warrnambool that Peggy,
youngest of the late Police-Magistrate
McCormack’s family, has promised to say “I
will” to McFarlane, a local resident. He is
said to be out of khaki only because he is
beyond the present age limit. Fiancee Peggy
is one of the best-liked and cheeriest girls
in the seaside city.
Mrs. Clive Leonard’s frocky sister, Phil
Reynolds, has at last unveiled her guilty
secret. In England she agreed to become
one with Wilfred Hunter, the fashionable
youth who fluttered here last year from Cal-
cutta, where he decorates the best business
circles. Being delicate he sports a reject
badge. Grand-dad Hunter was a N.S.W.
woolgrower, and one of Wilfred’s paternal
aunts is the Charles Rome widow who once
tied with the late Mrs. Donald Wallace for
local beauty honors.
The Archie Black lady has gone home to
Tarvvin Meadows, in Gippsland, with a new
baby, captured while she was staying with
her mother, Mrs. Mackie.
The Osbornes have gone back to Sydney
and Nan O’Hara Hill and her bridegroom
are taking in the Sydney races on their way
home to Bananaland. So the O’Hara wed-
ding party is broken up at last.
Flight-Lieutenant Clarence Flere, reported
missing in France, took over the management
of George Kelly’s Western District wool
patch when Charlie Kelly went to England to
get a commission in the Artillery. Subse-
quently manager Flere handed the woolly
job to an understudy, and steamed off to join
the airmen.
Ancient knight Arthur Snowden has given
place to Jimmy Dyer as president of the
Liedertafel —hoeh der —well, Go’ save the
King. This Vic. singing-concern after
nearly four years of warfare still chooses
to call itself by a Hun name. James, by the
way, is the bullion-encrusted importer who
married Louise £ f Smith ; and, by a coinci-
dence, he is partly in the dye-business, repre-
senting the British Dyewood Co.
Artist Pen Boyd returned with the last
batch of khaki invalids. After coming sec-
ond in the competition for a picture of Yass-
Dryberra, Pen went to Paris to study, and
when only 19 had a picture hung on the
line at the English Academy. Then gun-
powder ousted paint, he became a sergeant
and was gassed in the fighting at Passchen-
daele. A book of his war sketches is to be
published in London.
The Art Gallery trustees have appointed
W. B. Mclnnes to succeed the late Fred
McCubbin as teacher in the drawing school.
The appointment is for the period of Arma-
geddon, after which the position will again
be open.
Mary Allen, daughter of the knighted pro-
fessor, is making a little stir as an artist.
Anyhow, she has a duck of a studio, the one
in Dudley House that belonged to Fox and
then to Will Longstaff, and after him to
Meldrum. The walls are hung with dove-
grey and the floor is stained jet black. She
has just put Edward Goll on canvas.
Under the terms of the Felton Bequest
£3OO has been voted by the Art Gallery com-
mittee to buy war pictures by Streeton.
Wheeler and Crozier, the job of selecting
them being entrusted to R. B. Ross, art
critic and biographer of Oscar Wilde.
Squab raising is catching on among Mel-
bourne women. One is managing a squab-
bery of 1000 birds at Preston, although she
lets a man clean the pens and slaughter the
stock for market. Another girl, broader in
the jaw, sits down with a basket of squabs
and wrings their necks and plucks them.
Miss Armytage, of Como, who set the new
fashion, has a loft of 1000 at Beaconsfield.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty.
—“Taming of the Shrew,” Act V, Sc. 2.
“Try Fluke”: Friend o’ mine up at Puna-
ruka wanted a hefty young Maori to go back into
the Parepare bush and cut a couple of hundred
totara fencing-posts at £5 a hundred, fair average
pi ice. But Tuki made many excuses, each of which
"as demolished in turn. At last he came out
bluntly with the real reason for not wishing tP
leave the raupo domicile: “S’pose I go ’way out
lime to Parepare, that feller Tommy Tikera he
marry my missus ’ (only he didn’t say •‘marry*’).
“Oh, well,” said the settler lightly, “that won’t
do her any harm.” Tuki didn’t see it in that light
at all. Nevertheless the money tempted him, and
a few days later, when we rode up Parepare way, we
found his plump, tattooed missus dressed in a tat-
tered red petticoat and very little else, boiling
lukis billy. The loving husband presently explained,
showing a key that he wore around his neck
on a flax lanyard: “I settle that feller Tommy and
my missus, my word! I bring her here on te
horse and I bring te box on te packhorse, and I
lock all te close in te box all excep’ what she wear
now, till I finish te contrac’. She te proud missus,
all right; she no go home wit’out te close. She
stick to me t’is time all right, my word.”
* » * *
“Bouragi”: I agree with “Yannatherra”
(B. 7/3/’18) that the crocodile is a dumb dog. This
after years of experience of the chequered reptile
in North Queensland and Papua, in localities where
they are almost as plentiful and much less dangerous
than mosquitoes. Living or dying, the crocs of my
acquaintance have always maintained a gentlemanly
reticence, although one, which I met in a fish-trap
at Darn, went through all the motions of furious
and unrestrained blasphemy. Other crocs, noosed
with liana and yanked out of ancestral creeks by
Mambare natives, also declined to make any dying
depositions. My impression is that the fearsome
bellowing ascribed by museum naturalists to the
< rocodile are really those of bitterns, which com-
monly haunt the same localities. The bittern is
heard only at night, and it is much easier to credit
to the ungainly ’gator than to the shy and beautiful
bird his hair-raising and lugubrious bellowing.
* * * *
“Frilled Lizard”: Here is the recipe for
“Tarwhine” (B. 7/3/’18), who wants to tan his bush
mansion. Take the bark off in strips from a green
tree and let it dry in the sun until it begins to
curl. Then either cut it up very fine with a sharp
tomahawk or run it through a chaffcutter. Next soak
the bark in just enough water to cover it. Three
or four days later strain the liquor off into a wooden
trough or cask and soak the tent-fly in it. After
two days’ immersion wring out into the cask, and
add fresh bark. A couple of days afterwards take
(he bark out and soak the fly again. Repeat this
process until the required color is obtained. The
tanning properties of ironbark, I think, are far
below those of wattle, sally-wattle, bloodwood or
mangrove. While on Tucka Tucka station, Yetman
(N.S.W.), I successfully tanned fur skins and also
made good leather with brigalow bark. Some pines
are also tiptop. ■
“Wart”: Launceston Museum now pos-
sesses a unique specimen, the only skeleton in the
world of a A ototherium, one of Australia's strangest
giant marsupials. It most resembles a tapir, but
has portions of three other marsupials in its anat-
omy—the wombat, native bear and kangaroo. The
skeleton was dug up from the Mowbray swamp, at
Smithton, on the Speck’s north-west coast, some
seven or eight years ago. Previously the creature
had been known only by odd bones. The articula-
tion has been done by Curator Scott, and only one
small piece is missing from the skeleton.
OBSERVING THE PROPRIETIES.
MISS: “ ’Ave you such a thing as a black costume tint fit suit me?”
MADAM: “No; but we could make you a peautiful one in a few duns.”
MISS: “No good ter me. Yer see, we only ’card this trio min’ that me brother teas killed,
and I wanter go to the dornce ter-night .”
‘Barcoo”: “Merrigal” (B. 28/2/T8) is
mistaken when he says that the unrobing' of the
Dunlop station jumbucks in 1894 and 1895 was done
with shear blades. When the Wolseley machine was
put on the market in the late ’Bo’s, Sam McCaughey
was the first squattocrat to embrace the new
method, his Dunlop station being the first big show
to instal the gear. The whir of the clippers was
heard there in ’BB or ’B9. Shearers and sheepowners
alike were then still predicting awful calamities to
wool and sheep.
* * * *
“John Thursday - ’: Different varieties of
discolored brudder have different kinds of saluta-
tions. Binghi meeting Binghi after a long separa-
tion remarks “Yah!” or something to that effect.
Torres Strait Islanders grunt their greetings. Some
Papuans raise their arms, others shout the name of
the newly-arrived. Javanese are 'fond of a long,
complicated address of welcome. In some South
Sea Islands noses are rubbed, in others the hands
are held up palms outwards. But all cotton' on to
the white man’s fashion of shaking hands. Once,
when I was travelling along the beach near the
N’ailala River (Papua), a wrinkled old heathen
rushed out from a small village, placed himself
directly in my path, spat on his hand (presumably
to clean it), held it out and said “To-morrow!
to-morrow!” Farewells are often impressive. In
south-east Papua they have a so-long that acutely
conveys the idea of sadness at parting. It is.
“F, o-o-o, Eo-o-o-o!” and when half-a-hundrcd arc
chanting it the long-drawn-out “o” is one of the
saddest sounds imaginable.
“Leo Lear”: “H.V.E.” (B. 14/2/T8)
omits mention of the commonest venomous reptile
of Southern Victoria, i.e., the copper-snake. This
gent, is often mistaken for the black snake, and
no wonder, for sometimes he is as black as Wilhelm.
The copper-snake attains this hue in thick country
and around swamps ; in the open land the color is
much lighter. He is far more dangerous than the
black snake, which is seldom seen south of the
Dividing Range. The most reliable distinction be-
tween the two is in the scales between the vent and
tip of tail: the black cuss carries a single row, the
copper a double.
Barcoo”: The Bananaland jumbuck’s
fleece shows some peculiar colored patches in very
prolific seasons like our latest. On the top of
the shoulder, the neck and down the sides of the
overcoat are sections of bright blue or dark green—
the peculiarity is observed both on the rolling downs
and on the desert country. In the latter area, in
many instances, patches of pink- or coral-tinted
wool is prevalent. These spots never appear except
when vegetation is very prolific, and they are not
a vegetable dye or wood stain, as they will scour
out as white as snow. The fleece freaks seem
peculiar to Queensland, and samples sent to wool
experts puzzle the best of them. Personally I main-
tain that colonies of minute living organisms are
the cause.
“H.W.F.” : The best birds to indicate the
locality of water in summer months are the galahs.
These pink and grey cockies go regularly to drink
morning and evening, from sunrise till an hour after,
and from an hour before till sunset. They seem to
frequent the one drinking-place each season, and as
they are mostly within a few miles of it, are easily-
followed. I have seen half an acre of flat that was
closely packed with galahs, all drinking. This was
in 1885, 51 miles N.AV. of Bourke (N.S.AV.) and
near to an artesian bore which left an inch of water
over the flat. Other birds—bronze-wing and other
pigeons, for instance—go regularly to water, but are
not so easily seen or followed as the galahs.

“C.S.A. ’: At Kandos (N.S.W.), where
they are making some of Australia’s abundant lime-
stone, shale and coal into first-class cement, they
begin to understand a bit more about the Pacific
Islander's process of turning his fuzzy black head into
a yellow mop. Cement-making is a dusty job, and
ONE WINTER'S EVE IN FRANCE.
“Heigh! Shut the door, you dopey cows!
How dg you think a man's going to get
the rodin warm?"
the workmen who are employed in the neighborhood
of the place where the limestone is powdered are being
assured by the mis.sus that their hair is turning to a
faint red. It is at least possible that the missus
isn’t mistaken.

THE GREAT DECEPTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]

We ’limped our blueys, thirstin’ till we breathed a
kind of smoke,
’N’ struck all of a sudden this ’ere big, brown-
whiskered bloke.
Brown Whiskers he was standin’ side o’ somethin’.

Sez Dunn: ‘‘So ’elp me gracious, Bill, I do believe
it’s beer!”
It was a barrel, anyway, ’n’ four foot high, ’n’

'the other shares I mean to sell to thirsty men,” he
said.
We bought a share a-piece, ’n’ then we waited by the

He went, ’n’ there we waited. Every minute

FOSTER’S LAGER
“Machete”: Let “Shepherd” (B. 7/3/T8),
in his turn, listen to a lecture on ibis nests. He
says that the ibis does not nest on swamp timber
but in reed swamps, “the reeds being trampled down
for a floor.” As a matter of fact, the ibis prefers
the lignum bush to all other varieties of the earth’s
whiskers. Mr. and Mrs. Ibis build on the tops of
these bushes, which are low and matted, growing in
from two to three feet of swamp water. On this
rather precarious platform the youthful ibis lives
an ! has its being—if it doesn't get tangled up in
the bush or fall overboard. A very considerable pro-
portion of the ibis family do both, and papa and
mamma never make the slightest fuss about it, " nor
any attempt at a rescue. As a consequence, the atmo-
sphere of an ibis rookery is even more melodious
than the general run of such places. As for trampling
the average reed-bed down to a floor—well, a mob
of moas might do it.
* * * *
“Ornis”: The plea by “E.S.S." (B.
14/3/’18) that native trees be planted along all our
main roads, reminds me that a few years ago many
of the chief country roads in Tassv carried magnificent
silver wattles, either in clumps or singly. The same
can be said of but few now, for certain of the
councils had the trees stripped and sold the bark.
Thus for the sake of a few pounds trees that were
things of beauty w»re put to a slow death and their
whitening limbs left as a reproach to the Bumbles.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: Want a cheap, sure way
to keep bugs and fleas away from the beds? Tie
two or three small bunches of fennel to the mattress
and leave them hanging towards the floor. One
bunch will do service for about a fortnight. If you
hang a bunch above your head you will hear the
mosquitoes cursing in the distance
“Ivan Pentland”: The existence of “donli-
gahs,” the wild men covered- with hair of whom
“Te Whare” writes (B. 't| /’ 18), was firmly believed
in when I was a boy on the N. S. Wales South Coast
30-odd years ago. And not only in Binghi circles
either. Superior persons who wanted to account for
Douligah without assenting to his reality used” io say
that some of the kanakas brought by Ben Boyd to
his whaling station at Twofold Bay in the ’forties
had “gone bush,” and had given rise to the legend of
a wild tribe living in the coastal ranges. Maybe:
but only a few years ago a “hairy man” answering
to Douligah’s description was alleged to have been
seen on several occasions near Talbingo (N.SAV.), in
the rough country between the headwaters of the
Tumut and Murrumbidgee—not so very far from the
South Coast gullies. By the way, has any Aboliar
come across the wild camels believed in the middle
of last century to be running in the scrubs between
Merimbula (N.S.W.) and the Vic. border? They, of
course, were also said to have been brought by Ben
Boyd. In fact, either Boyd or Dr. George lmlay
(locally known as “Emily”) was at the bottom of
pretty well everything on the far South Coast of the
M< State when my dad first struck it in the ’fifties.
“Diomed”: Let me apologetically dig up
for the last time that old vexation about the birth
of the Too. The photograph enclosed bar-
racks strongly for the teat theory. Mamma Too was
caught in my presence, and 1 took a 'graph just to
simplify the payment of Wagers. It shows the embryo
on the teat clearly. The embryo was about a month
old. Charley Raven and Jim Baldwin, two Tooers
“MISSING."
THE MISSUS : “You look so strong and well
— it’s hard to believe you’re a wounded
soldier.”
THE MENDICANT : “No. lady, I’m worse’n
that—I am one of the ‘missing.’”
of 2't years’ standing, definitely state that they have
seen the young ’un on the teat no bigger than a
mole on a pretty girl’s face. They declare that the
infant is attached to the teat until the connection or
cord of life withers, after which it hops in and out
and feeds itself.
CLEARING UP THE DOUBT.
INTELLIGENT CONSTABLE (giving evidence in a case of Sunday trading): “Oi entered
the bar, your Worship, percaicin’ six glasses av a liquid nature on the counter.
On drink-in’ the contents av the glasses, your Worship, I kim to the conclusion
that they had contained beer.”
“S.P.Q.R.”: Mrs. T. Puller, wife of a
60-cow cocky, reproves me:—
Dear Teacher,- —[ wish you woddent scold my
Bill for missn his lessns, as it worry’s him, and me.
Also his father, and interfeers with his milkn. We
don't want him made a scollar, but just like his
dad and uncles. He says,. he don’t like lessns —
espet illy Dictaton —so please; teacher, give him a
spell.
.Tim Rogers, old-age pensioner, rouseabout
•and'beer-shark, was sitting in his boss’s jinker out-
side the Cowslip Arms, when a pair, attached to a
heavy waggon, bolted. The waggon cannoned into
the jinker, and old Jimmy shot straight up and landed
headfirst on the road. Unconscious, he was carried
into the bar and the doctor was ’phoned. Just as
Sawbones arrived Jimmy' opened his eves wonder-
ingl.v. Gazing’ round lie noticed the familiar
bottles and shelves, and his face lit up with a
smile. “Mine's a beer,” he said.

“Yanna tlierra” : Verily the blight of the
missionary is like unto the X disease. Recently I
dropped off the toy Howard Smith boat calling at
the Palm Islands (N.Q.), and soon was sad. There
used to be an abo. settlement on Blackfellows Bay.
The boys toiled moderately for enough and more,
whilst the gins bore families of happy, healthy little
piccaninnies. I knew them there when the curses of
civilisation —beer, tobacco and disease—were un-
known. The abos. were all Island-born and bred
and finely-built samples of mankind, who lived
naturally and wore clothes only on festive occa-
sions. Then the blight arrived, laden with rags
and ragged ideas. The abos. were removed to a
further-north mainland mission-station. Decorated
with chemises and blouses, the gins contracted
disease with great enthusiasm. In pants and shirts
the boys soon learnt to discriminate between Carlton
and Tooth’s. Now they are dying off fast —eight
are reported dead in the last few months. But
what does that matter? They can sing hymns and
are. Christians now.
* * * *
“Murrabit”: That indefatigable worker
among Australian historical records, Ernest Scott, of
Melb. Uni., has unearthed rather a curious mistake
or falsification in connection with the name of Aus-
tralia's Central Mount Stuart. John McDouall Stuart
reached this spot on April 21, 1860, in his attempt
to cross the continent from south to north. Then, as
related in his published journal, the party erected a
cone of rocks and hoisted the Union Jack, a silken
gift from the young ladies of Adelaide. A bottle
was played in the pile holding an inscription, giving
particulars of the discovery and the name which
Stuart bestowed on it. This name was given as
Central Mt. Stuart in the published journal ; but
when Scott recently procured the original paper from
the bottle in the Adelaide Library he was astonished
to find that the label allotted to the eminence by
Stuart was Central Mt. Sturt in honor of his old
leader in former expeditions.
“McNortb” : A year or so after the estab-
lishment of the mission-station on Mornington Island,
Gulf of Carpentaria, The Bulletin printed a par.
of mine pointing out that the Chief Protector’s report
for that year contained a statement that whooping-
<ough and measles had appeared on the island. It
was the mere casualness of the statement and the fact
that the appearance of foreign diseases on the island
was not given the emphasis of block headings (hat
impelled me to write and urge that the matter should
be treated as important. It is hard to get behind a
nigger's mind and discover real causes for many of
his actions ; but despite what is brought forth at the
trial of the alleged murderers, old hands who are
credited with a working knowledge of Black Brud-
der and his ways assert that the most probable cause
of the recent Mornington Island tragedy is that
Binghi attributed the presence of the strange diseases
to the missionaries, resented it, and avenged himself
accordingly. That is the sort of thing that doesn’t
come out in alleged courts of justice.

“John Quill’': “Ititasun” (B. 14/8/’18)
asks how many voting ones a black snake has at
one birth, and instances the lady-reptile with 45
near Elmore (Vic.). At the beginning of this year
a black she-devil with 49 snakelets was captured near
Triinkey (N.S.W.). But T. Pye, of Judds Creek,
Bathurst district (N.S.W.), eclipsed these captures
many years ago when lie got one with 56 youngsters
hanging to her apron-strings. •
“Wandi”: For Murray cod the Severn
River (Q.) is the best place 1 ever threw a line.
The mailman used to buy all the fish he could get at
3d. a pound, taking a load every week to Stanthorpe
and Goondiwindi. A mate and I bought a lot of
salt and got busy. There was no trouble in capturing
the fish ; they almost asked to be pulled out of the
water. Each day we carried to camp as much on
a long pole as the two of us could stagger under.
Even then we had once or twice to tether a cod in
the river till morning. By the end of the week we
had a square stack as high as our tent. Then we
interviewed the mailman. He shook his head
gravely. No, he wasn’t taking any more. The
market had dropped; besides, his cargoes went bad
on the road this hot weather. He had to throw his
last lot overboard, and the stench of it was so
powerful that the stock-inspector had threatened to
prosecute him for creating a nuisance. Next morn-
ing we left very early. We also left the fish.
“Silas Snell'’: “We ’ad a sorter clog wot
used ter paddle under the cart,” said the travelling
tinker. “I dunno wot breed iv dog he was, but he
looked like somethin’ or another with a dash iv
tiger in it. He was a great eater o’ sheep. Used ter
eat all the bark off ’em. He’d run aside five mile
to kill a sheep ’n’ strip it, ’n’ we orter hung him
long ago, on’v ’Airy was attached to him. ’Arry
was the sort iv feller would get attached to
a gohanner. One day a bound’ry-rider from Bardon’s
ranged alongside our camp, ’n’ swore our dog had
bin killin’ Bardon’s sheep, ’mong others a ole rani
wot could trace its descent from the ’Ouse iv Lords
or somethin’. ’Arry wouldn’t ’ave it—said his dog
didn’t never kill sheep, couldn’t ’n’ wouldn't. ‘’E
’ates mutton,’ sez ’Arry. ‘Very well,’ sez the boun-
d’ry-rider, ‘l’ll bring a sheep ’n’ I’ll bring witnesses,
’n' we’ll try him. If he’s a killer there’ll be trouble
for you, that’s all.’ The feller rode off ’n’ ’Arrv got
to work on his dog with medicine. Back come
Bardon's bound’ry-rider, with a constable ’n' an-
other bloke, and draggin’ a nold sheep. Well, they
shooed that sheep round ’n’ loosed Tige; but Tige's
stomach was goin’ back on him, ’n’ he 'ad no inter-
est in sheen. Instead he was very ill —I never
see a dog iller. ‘There!’ sez ’Arry. ‘Wot ’id 1
tell yeh? He's fair sick at the sight iv a sheep.'
But Bardon’s bound’ry-rider ’n’ the cop downed
on the dog, ’n’ they pinched ’Any. Whaffor ?
Well, yeh see, the dog had give up a ’ole lot ’iv
wool. That wool was reproduced in evidence agin
Enery, ’n’ he ’n’ the dog was fined guilty.” “But,”
said the storekeeper, “that’s absurd. The wool in
such circumstance wouldn’t be evidence against your
friend.” The travelling tinker sighed. “It was,”
be said finally. “You see, it had Bardon’s brand on
it.”
“A.Y.11.” : A bulloi’ky packing up outside
a pub store in Kimberley, requiring some protection
for his bottled rations, turned to his blackboy: “Get
me some straw envelopes quick fella.” .Tacky dived
inside and returned with pincers and claw-hammer.
“No more that one, blast yer! Straw envelopes!”
Next minute the bewildered .lacky fetched a screw
wrench. The cowpuncher hopped in himself and got
an armful of covers. “There, you Myall.
Tins one envelopes.” .Tacky glared. “What the
matter you no bin vabber ‘trowsis belongs bottle’?”
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : Generally bushmen cling to
Binghi’s nomenclature, but when the aldermen or
some town official cun get in with the signbrush
first, the euphonious appellations of the old people
are ignored. The Water Conservation'and Irrigation
Commission made a notable departure in the naming
of the streets in the new town of Griffith, in the
Murrumbidgee irrigation area. All the names, having-
somel reference to water, are appropriate, such as
Kuttamulla (water or small stream), Makkri, Kook-
ora, Palla, Nukkoru, VVakaden (all of which mean
rain), Bonna (water), Warrainbool (flood-water in a
swamp), Kooyoo (fish); and Coolah (a tree with
water-holding roots). The jarring note is struck in
saddling the town itself with such a name as Griffith,
and it will be a thousand pities if the Commission
doesn’t change it to something that will conform with
the street designations. The streets of a couple of
Western Queensland towns are all named after trees
and flowers, preference being shown to those growing
in the district. This is a good idea, too. Besides
striking an original note, it proves a stimulus to
children in studying the botany of their neighbor-
hood. In its street nomenclature Broken Hill also
set an excellent example; but when the little aider-
men arrived they introduced the old habit of naming
thoroughfares and places after persons whom most
people know nothing about, and nobody but their
intimate friends want to remember. However, Broken
Hill got a long start of the little aldermen, and thus
its older streets are called Argent, Cobalt, Oxide,
Bromide, Chloride, Sulphide, lodide, Crystal, Beryl,
Kaolin, Talc, Gossan, Blende, Mica, Wolfram, Galena,
etc. But after that arrived Ryan and Gaffney and
Williams and Creedon —small aldermen and the like,
long since utterly forgotten.

“Exile”: Last year I wrote about the
cafeteria restaurant system of California,
under which one helped oneself to a
tray, knives, forks, spoons, serviette and
iced water, with any other items not requir-
ing to be carved or served. There were sev-
eral waitresses to carve meat, supply vege-
tables or tea and coffee. The rest of the
waiting was done by the guest, both time
and money being saved. Now the system has
been applied to a grocery. All the buyer
does is to supply a basket, pass along
shelves and counters and help himself to
packets of anything. All prices are clearly
marked on the packets. Having finished
your shopping you escape by the only exit,
where a cashier calculates what you owe by
glancing through the basket and takes your
money. The cost of running such a grocer’s
shop, called a Figgly-Wiggly, is 3 per
cent, on the turnover, as compared with 20
per cent, where shopmen are duplexed.
“Oyo” : “87” (B. 34/3/T8) mentions how
a case of whisky was tampered with. But
why go to the trouble of opening the case
and leaving marks of pillage? Here’s how
wliarfies get a free refresher. Drop the
case hard enough to break one or more of
the bottles, grab the case immediately, and
hold it over a bucket or some such vessel.
The case then shows no outside signs of
shortage, and is what is known as a
jingler. A little of the spirit is lost, but
the gargle is there for consumption a lot
earlier, and in such instances speed mostly
counts. It did when 1 was there.
“ILD.”: It happened in Hob Speight's
fizzy days at Thorpdale, the terminus of a
Victorian cockspur line 11 miles from Moo.
570 ft. higher and separated therefrom by 21
river bridges. The train was due to leave
daily at 7.50 a.m. One morning the 7..‘10
breakfast bell at Day’s saloon aroused the
engine-men, who raced past the waiting pas-
sengers on the station to mount the footplate
of a cold, fireless engine. Here was a mess;
but with others I levered the loco, from the
engine-shed on to the main line and the verge
of the down descent; likewise the carriage
and van after passengers, mails, etc., had
been loaded, xhe impact of the carriage and
van pushed off the engine, and away went the
train on its downward journey, practically
on time, thus avoiding all unpleasant ex-
planations, yet without enough fire on the
grating to make smoke.

“Sr” (B. 2S/2/T8) wants to
know if dropping a banknote to snare a
larger sum is an old trick. Twenty-five
years ago an Adelaide stockbroker was in a
King William-street bank. It was just on the
tick of three o'clock, and he had drawn
£2OOO in notes of small denomination, which
he stuffed into a brief bag. lie was about
to lift the luggage from the counter when the
polite stranger tapped him on the shoulder
and pointed to a note on the floor. The
broker picked it up and, thanking the man,
grabbed his bag and hurried off. When he
opened it in his office it contained old news-
papers. While he was stooping a similar
bag had been substituted.

“Amber” : Cyclones and white ants play up
with Bananaland telegraphs. But the most
persistent pests are the cockatoo and the
flying-fox. A mob of cockatoos comes to rest,
on a span of wire and weighs it down until
it comes into contact with another wire ; then
that wire becomes useless until the meeting
is over. Again, cocky loses his temper, takes
the wire in his beak, and swings, cutting the
wire till it breaks, or so weakens it that the
first strain brings it down. The flying-fox
gets tangled in the wires, and forms a
“cross,” rendering one or more wires useless
until the lineman comes along and removes
his carcase. This is a daily occurrence in
the summer season. The most peculiar in-
terruption I have met with was on the
Apollo Bay (Vic.) line. This was caused
by spiders’ webs spun along the line. When
the dew settled on them they provided such
a good path to earth for the current that the
line was completely unworkable.

The S. Aus. Supreme Court isn’t keeping
up the reputation it had in Way’s time ror
not having its decisions reversed. The
Licensing Court proposed to consider an ob-
jection that a certain hotel was not required
for the accommodation of the public. The
licensee argued that the last Local Option
poll was against any reduction in numbers
for that district, and that this settled the
question. The Supreme Court upheld that
view. The High Court has decided against
it, and directed the Licensing Court to go on
considering. lint, when it started, counsel
warned it that there is a Privy Council as
well as a High Court.

yell the Federal politicians. Then a Bun-

cal instruments have been supplied to it

“McN.”: The nor’-west season is going
full lick up here (.Thursday Island) and
the beche-de-mer, trocluis and pearl-fishing
fleets are lying up in harbor. For eight
months in the year the favorable wind and
fine weather of the south-east season allows
the boats to go their hardest; but the re-
maining four moons are mostly windy and
rainy, with tides that run the wrong way.
Also, the sea is muddied by freshes from
mainland streams and by slime and weeds
stirred up from the bottom. So from Decem-
ber to April the craft lie in harbor and over-
haul, and the bare masts of the acres of
anchored luggers look like a ringbarked for-
est. Thursday Island has a busy appear-
ance at this time. Jap divers and tenders
clatter along the street in their curious
wooden sandals, Malay and Papuan crews
and pump-boys stroll along bare-footed, and
from the boat-slip come the banging of
hammers and other noises of industry.
Thursday is lucky to have a busy appear-
ance just now. When the row in Europe
started the bottom fell out of the mother-o'-
pearl market, and had it not been for the
discovery of uses for trocluis shells —the
spiral cones that lay unregarded more or
less abundantly about the reefs—-the Island
would have been broke by this. A little
pearling is still being done, but trochus
shells saved the situation.

“R.M.”: I went up to Sydney G.P.O. this
morning at a quarter past 10, asked to be
put on to Tamworth, and paid my 3s. sd.
At 10 minutes past 11 I suggested to one of
Webster’s Own that he might see if he could
get a move on. He put his hand to his
mouth and whispered, “Patience, brother.”
I humored him. At half-past 11 I sug-
gested that man was only mortal and he
countered with his old wheeze. At 20 min-
utes past 12 I got the gratifying report that
Tamworth wanted me on No. 1. The first
exclamation I got from the young lady when
I went in the box was: “You ought to be
more patient; you do no good trying to
hurry us up !” They’re a candid lot.

“Kopai”: The Hughes Government is very
busy chivvying the little trader who dares to
get an extra thrummer a tin for kerosene, or
sells jam at B|d. instead of Bd., but it never
seems to notice the big thieves. A short
time ago-works were built to compete with
imported iron pig and bar. When it started
out, pig was being landed at £4 a ton, and
bar at £7. It was confident it could easily
meet oversea competition at those prices.
To-day’s quotation for Australian pig is £10;
for bar £25 ! Now, we’ll admit wages have
gone up a little ; so has coal; so have ship-
freights. But have any or all of them gone
up enough to make a commodity, the raw
material of which is on the spot, leap up'
from £4 and £7 to £lO and £25 V But this
thing being controlled presumably by the
wealthy men whom Hughes wailed about at
Bendigo the other day. nobody notices it.
Meantime a hundred little foundries that
could be establishing businesses in minor
castings are starving for pig, and a set of
horseshoes costs ten bob!
* * * *
“Te Whare” : I wonder if any commercial
use can be made of the dye-matter contained
in shells? A large shell-fish, shaped like a
sea-slug, and, I think, of the same order,
exudes a dye of a deep violet color. I
have found it bogged in the mud-flats of our
eastern tidal lakes and estuaries. A pelagic
shell commonly cast up on our beaches after
heavy weather also contains a violet dye-
stuff. It is the violet ianthus and some-
times comes ashore in quantities. The
common limpet-shell secretes an acrid fluid
which stains the skin pink and won’t wash
off for days. The odor is most unpleasant,
but the stuff which exudes from the violet
ianthus and the slug-like creature aforesaid
does not stink. Were not the togas of
Roman emperors dyed with material from the
purple mu rex—a Mediterranean conch, I
think?

“A.G.”: Ted, Snow and Jerusalem, with
four sound legs among them, minor damages
and three days’ unexpired leave, debated the
question of finance in Trafalgar Square.
They were nearly as stiff as Nelson on the
column. Jerusalem scratched hard and said
lie had a remedy. They-boarded a ’bus to
reach a Tommy camp in Surrey where Jeru-
salem had a “sugared” acquaintance. Un-
fortunately the intended victim was out, and
a big sports meeting had cleared the camp.
Their chance looked dismal —until Snow
spotted a hawker in the camp. Instantly he
got eloquent and imaginative, and persuaded
the man to buy an empty marquee for two
pounds. The hawker got his receipt, and
the trio were just far enough away to over-
hear the uproarious argument that com-
menced when the guard pulled up the hawker
driving out with the purchase.

What wonderful mothers tlie Bush does

“Dusk,” from a previously-unknown contri-

it turned out that they were the work of a

away up at Rossville, which you reach from

“Evoe”: Ada Kidgell Holman couldn’t

“V.”: Three members of the Queensland
A..T.A. were out for Assembly seats at this

The third, Raudoloh Bedford, just missed
Carnarvon. Still there is the gold pass of
the M.L.C. waiting to be picked up when lie
returns —if he wants it. And he seemed to
love it. That Ebenezer Sizer should betaken
and Bedford left is really a joke. Bedford
is Australian to the last bead of sweat
on his dome; Sizer is a young immi-
grant whose want of knowledge of Austra-
lian conditions and ideals is equal to that
of any other two men in the A.J.A. James
put up a fine performance, capturing Imgan
from the Liberals after they had held it 2b
years.

W. H. Braine, who passed out the other
day in the 80th lap, was the veteran inky-
wavfarer of N. S. Wales South Coast, where
lie had lived for over half a century. In the
’seventies he started the Bega Gazette in
opposition to William Neilly’s Standard,
and ran it for 30 years till his health failed.
The Gazette’s radicalism didn't always suit
the cow-worshippers of those parts, and sale-
days used often to see a procession of Straw-
berry’s owners toiling up Gipps-street to
Braine’s office to “stop the rag”; but they
soon missed Braine’s pepper, and mostly
came back to renew. The Gazette had
some strenuous days, and it didn’t bring its
proprietor a fortune ; but it kept the demo-
cratic flag flapping in a citadel of conserva-
tism so long as the old battler was on deck.

“S.T.S.”; “0.K.,” who finds “rotten” in
Sliakspeare, but is “not yet on the track of
‘blooming’ ” (B. 14/3/’3B), should have no
difficulty in overtaking it. Meanwhile, lie
can make a note of the still more modern
“blinking.” _ In the casket scene of the
“Merchant,” the Prince of Arragon pulls
out disgustedly “the portrait of a blinking
idiot.” But there —if you start looking up
a correct use of words now used wrongly,
or differently, you can go a long way. It
stands on record in a Charles Wesley hymn:
“Blast the blooming works of grace !” Only
Charles did not use the capital B, or the
exclamation note; he merely said that
Satan’s agents w r ere trying to do a bit of
dynamiting.

“O. Blin” : Clemenceau, who takes the helm
in France after nearly half a century of
active politics, is now 77. He has punc-
tured more reputations perhaps than any
other journalist. His paper w T as lately
L’Homme Libre ; he satirically changed it
under the Censorship to L’Homme Moins
Libre, and finally finished up as L’Homme
Enchaine. Clemenceau has often given
President Poincaire a scorching reminder of
his powrnrs. But Poincaire, too magnani-
mous to ignore his ability, called this best-
hated politician in France to form a Minis-
try, and the ferocious old patriot received a
vote of confidence that could be heard in
Berlin.

Of all Australian penmen Boyd Cable

experiences as an airman into “Over the

land when the gong sounded, has been in
khaki—most of the time as an artillery
.officer—for over 3-1- years.

S. S. Smith, who came to the end of the

POLITICAL
POINTS
There is a glimmer of hope for better
things in the fact that the new Lawson Min-
istry in Victoria doesn’t pretend to be all
of one mind about everything. Ministers can
think what they please on the eternal Bible-
in-schools question, for instance, and about
the tote, and a few other matters. In the
good days to come Ministers won’t be asked
to pretend to agree about anything. As a
matter of fact they don’t really agree about
anything, except, perhaps, that office is very
desirable, and the mere exercise of pretend-
ing agreement makes hypocrites and hum-
bugs of them all.
MOSTLY.
“Fishin's a cruel sport , though.”
“ Yes, it's full of disappointments.”
Counted with care, Sydney could produce
no more than 23 Cabinet Ministers one day
last week. Great Britain has (or lately
had) 21 all told.
Some extracts from Prime Minister
liughes’s great speech amid the cows and
the pumpkins at Sydney Show Ground: —
Ravages of war.... glorious men. .. .blood freely
....bloody fight. .. .sacrifice.,. .hundreds of thou-
sands of lives. .. .blood of men. ... BONES... .Arma-
geddon .... holocaust... .sacrifice. .. .b100d... .bitter
end.
In fact, the speech contained everything
except entrails. Entrails were unfortu-
nately left out. But there were heaps of
“sacrifice.” And how sad it is to reflect
that, if the Government had held no foolish,
costly, time-wasting referendums, but had
risen in Parliament and staked the blood
and bones of its billet on the compulsory
service issue, this country might have Arma-
goddoned to more purpose and had a better
show of being there at the bitter end. As
it is, the undertakers will look in vain for
Hughes’s bloodstained portfolio among the
dead.
THE SOFT ANSWER.
ANGRY ACTOR : “Well, I never stole another
man's brains.”
CALM DITTO: “ Maybe that’s the trouble.”
The Governor-General to the Commercial
Travellers in Sydney last week :
The restriction of imports and of markets for
certain raw products—due to the war or to our
inability to build ships to provide freight—should
stimulate local manufacture.
If the Governor-General wasn't a very un-
comfortable man as he made that speech he
ought to have been. Why is Australia un-
able to build ships? Why is the Broken Hill
Prop, not building ships at this moment?
Because, refusing an appeal to the people,
after they had defeated what the Govern-
ment declared was an indispensable part of
its policy, the Governor-General retained in
office a Prime Minister who stood in the way
of the co. going ahead with the business.
Next to Hughes, no man in this country has
to carry a heavier load of responsibility in
connection with our failure to start ship-
building than the Governor-General himself.
To say that the unions have held this busi-
ness up won’t hold water. The complete
answer is that the Broken Hill Prop, was
prepared to go ahead.
So Frank Anstey, the one Labor man
whose tongue Hughes really fears, has fore-
stalled Hughes in his departure for England.
While the little man was packing a hand-
bag with big-sounding platitudes, Anstey, a
seaman in his younger days, quietly slipped
away before the mast, with a passport from
the Federal Government in his pocket. He
had been on the water for a week before the
papers missed'him. Then the roundsmen and
the Trades Hall reporters got busy ; but all
they could elicit was that he had gone to
England to visit his aged mother. The Labor
party knew nothing. The Socialist party’s
secretary denied that lie had gone as its
representative. In fact, nobody could say
anything except that Frank had just gone
home to mumma.
There are 350 different proposals to be con-
sidered at the coming Labor Conference.
They embody every kind of theoretical wild
cat —tortoiseshell, black, grey, tabby, striped,
plain backyard cat and midnight cat on the
roof. But nobody suggests that the richest
country in the world (on paper) should find
its daily crust without floating the eternal
loan in London.
If it is content to go crooked Labor will
not change the Bananaland electoral divi-
sions. In all about 164,UU0 people lately voted
for Labor, whilst 139,000 went for the
Nationals; yet in the new House
have, say, 49 members against, say, 23 on
the other side.
Those politicians who used the war to
camouflage their rush for office continue to
get hard knocks from the fighting men. Now
it is Lieut. Denny, M.C., formerly Attorney-
General of S. Aus., and re-nominated for his
Adelaide seat, who cables from hospital:
“Totally repudiate slightest association with
alleged Nationalists. Urge all to vote solid
Labor.”
“Mustard Gold” looks down and weeps:—
Westralian Premier Lefroy, whose amiability is
almost his only qualification, pilots a Ministerial
crowil as ordinary as himself. Since Wilson went
there is no shining intellect in the boat, nor can
you find among the whole Westralian political crew,
with the possible exception of Collier, Opposition
leader, any personality such as used to
bring the crowd to hear the debates in
the House. Even Tommy Walker’s
wildly-gleaming eye and whirling ges-
ticulation no longer impress the multi-
tude, for Tommy lacks the sense of pro-
portion to such a degree that his
fiercest anathema may be levelled at the
smallest mosquito. Westralia lacks a
robust politician to steer a course, and
could well dispose of many of the old
Parliamentary salts who still hold the
electors. Give Lefroy his due, he
acknowledges his demerits, apologises
for his ineptitude, and perhaps would
gladly get out of public life altogether.
Greatness is thrust upon him, not
sought. In a past Administration,
given the portfolio of Mines, he
with an experience wholly pastoral
frankly admitted that he knew nothing
about mining. “But,” brightening up
and gathering confidence, “I've been
down a well”; and thus equipped he
plugged along with the task of keeping
the goldfields on their feet. A man on
the Nationalist side fit to succeed him
as Premier and strike the high note of
leadership is not apparent. Robinson,
Attorney-General, has ability and a gift
for handling the finer mechanism of the
political machine, but he has none of
the qualities which would get the crowd
to follow him. In short, Westralia is
governed by hopeless mediocrities, whose
calibre is about on the plane of the
common municipal council which en-
dorses the minutes of the previous
meeting and votes further sums for the extension
of the local drain.
Latest figures issued by N. S. Wales
statistician covering manufactories in the
State: —•
1913. 1916-17.
Hands emploved .. .. 120,400 117,732
Value of plant .. .. £14,861,670 £19,372,430
Raw materials . . . . 40,537,476 56,332,156
Output 65,072,495 85,452,138
Value added per employee .. 197 229
Average wages .. .. 109 124
Value of output per employee 567 751
Average wages went up 14 per cent., while
the value added per employee increased 16
per cent, and the value of output 32 per
cent. The cost of material, fuel and wages
in relation to the production of 1913 was
80 per cent.; in 1916-17 it was 84 per cent,
apparently fl 6s. had to be paid last year to
get the raw material which could be
acquired for fl three years earlier—an
advance of 30 per cent. But whereas be-
tween 1913 and 1917 workers’ wages in-
creased 14 p.c., the purchasing power of
those workers’ wages declined, according to
Ivnibbs, by 22 per cent.; so it looks as if
purveyors of raw material were on a sub-
stantially better wicket than the industrial
worker, and that, in spite of a lot of loose
talk, capital has been getting very fair
nourishment.
From a Southern correspondent:—
“No one knows if Dr. Kent Hughes ever got into
the blood-stained capital [Petrograd] or argued
with the Bolsheviks,” said Johanna, in a recent
Melbourne letter. Well, he didbut the capital isn’t
as blood-stained as it’s cracked up to be in the
cables. Hughes, who has been with the Anglo-
Russian hospital in Petrograd, says the upheavals of
July and November, which followed the real up-
heaval in March, 1917, were organised by Hun
agents. There is, he asserts, no solid party in
Russia under the name of Bolshevik. Any larrikin
soldier is so dubbed. Cohesion is a thing of the
past, and there is more bad feeling between North
and South than between either of them and the
Germans. Russia will not be able to put another
army into the field—the peasants are an undisciplined,
uneducated mob, their gods gluttony and immorality.
Stories of murder and pillage are absolutely unreli-
able, and where they actually occurred the mur-
derers were in many cases Germans dressed as
Russians. During the revolution Bird’s hospital
was 400 yards from the storm centre. Three patients
were admitted, and three men were brought in dead.
That was the lot!
If the Vic. backbloeks don’t get a fair deal
and a trifle over, it isn’t because they never
handle the cards themselves. The State’s
very newest Cabinet contains only three Min-
isters who represent metropolitan mobs—
Treasurer McPherson, Public Works Robin-
son and Hon. Minister McWhae. The other
nine hail from the country. In Bowser’s lot
there were but three city reps., and Pea-
cock’s had the same number.
A text is a safe card to play in Adelaide.
Peake, the S.A. Premier, being interviewed
on political chances, admitted that a Labor
Ministry may come in after the general elec-
tion, but recalled cheerfully that neither
Verran nor Vaughan lasted out a Parlia-
ment. “I think.” said he, “I have read
somewhere that ‘the wicked shall not live
out half his days.’ ” Which is bowdlerising
the Good Book anyway. “Wicked” is not
what it says at all, hut perhaps Peake
thought lie knew his S. Australia too well to
risk the vigorous Saxon of Psalm lv, 23.
PLAIN PROOF.
BILLO ( from Melbourne) : “These two
prisoners I've got ’ere's both mad. One
says lie's from Brunswick bat he don't
know Sydney-road, and the other bloke
says he’s from Heidelberg and never
heard of the Yarra.”
DEFEAT—MARCH 20, 1918.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fields are full of slaughter arid red flatne;
Our ranks are thinning in the grim retreat.
So vast the avalanche of death that came
No courage could the wild steel-horror meet.
We pause, breathe hard, and fear and face —defeat!
Not yet, not yet! A thousand times those lands
Of France resounded to the victor shout
Too early raised. Then hearts seemed less than hands
Till stubborn valor fiercely turned about
And swept the faltering triumph into rout !
Not yet we fail! Mauled is the lion’s mane;
But who, while yet he lives, shall sell the skin?
Sore stricken, we shall rise to strike again ;
And where the fainting ranks in blood grew thin
There shall be greater fields to fight and win.
But if we fail?... .If the lights flicker low
And the great blackness come upon us all,
There shall be little pride for that strong foe
Who drove our legions bleeding to the wall;
For from the sod their blood shall call and call.
That calling men shall hear—each rebel heart
Straining against the menace and the might
Of murder that has torn the world apart;
And ever at the breaking of the night
There shall be valor for the endless fight.
Truth shall not fail before a staff of steel,
Though mighty armies perish in its name!
The little kings upon their thrones shall reel
And glory wrought in blood be one with shame
Ere man to this machine of war grow tame.
Take heart of grace! Not yet we bow the head.
The purpose of the world knows no retreat.
The trumpet at the mouth of all our dead
Blows only victory ! The ages greet
With scorn the whimper of a world-defeat!

It may have been from anxiety to see
Desert Gold. Or people may have wanted to help
the national war effort. Or again the public may
be just daft over horse and decided to arise and
awake and have a flutter in case the powder magazine
blew' up before another Cup could be run. Anyway,
there the fact is—the A..T.C. Autumn mooting opened
at ltandwick on Saturday with more people on the
premises than had over been there before, and on
Monday they all rushed back and brought reinforce-
ments with them. The sweating', jostling crowds
packed the stands and swarmed over the enclosures
in broiling sun and gammoned they liked it. But
most of them wished the rest had gone fishing. It
was ltandwick at its worst —the turning of a day’s
sport into a penitential pilgrimage. Going a-racing
in a mob so thick that the citizen who tries to keep
tab of the riders and sera tellings in each event and
have a look at the nags has about as much chance
of getting a view of the proceedings as the late
lamented Buckley. But there was some really good
racing to be seen, all the same; and on the second
day the books reckoned it was the most peauteeful
they had noticed for a long while. The favorite in
every race went down—bang!
There were 23 in the Doncaster this time and
most money for Dame Acre, Cetigne, Panacre and
Pah King. After her two wins at Rosehill a fort-
night before, the mare had been resolutely backed
from 20’s down to 4’s. On that running she was, of
course, entitled to much respect, though there still re-
mained room for reasonable doubt whether an animal
which had hitherto been no more than a pretty smart
sprinter would run a mile right out from the barrier
to the lino. Between Rosehill and Saturday the mare
convinced the stable on that point, and her trainer,
Booth, made no secret of his confidence. Well, the
end of it was that she won and won well, in record
time for the race. Cetigne drew a bad marble —next
hut one to the rails. Dame Acre and Poitrina were
8 and 11, Panacre next, Pali King 16, and Shadow-
land, who carried a heavy wad of Melbourne money,
well out. Poitrina was early to work and hopped
away into the front from Dame Acre, Panacre and
Satin Bird close handy. Cetigne had commenced
badly and been chopped right back. Dame Acre
closed on the leader on the turn and they struck the
straight together. At this stage Panacre was holding
bis own, and Lordacre and Redfern were in the pic-
ture. Of the others all had punctured except Cetigne,
who broke free by coining round on the outside. A
fnlong further Dame Acre had shaken off Poitrina
and opposite the Leger drew away. Here Cetigne
began to move up closer, and for a moment or two
looked like coming on, but the mare was out of
reach by him. Panacre made a run at her from the
half-distance and was probably going the faster in
the finishing strides, but the lady refused to feel
tired and hit the line a length to the good. A fine
gnl lop and an unexciting race,.
It is no use saying that anything could have done
better than the winner had the race been differently
run, nor any good supposing that had Panacre made
nn earlier effort to get. up he would have worried the
marc down. It is more than likely that he would
have been the first of the pair to crack. But the
merit of Cetigne’s third was, in point of actual
nilining', little less than that of Dame Acre’s win. She
and Panacre had saloon passages throughout. Cetigne
was tangled up in the ruck nearly all the way, and
at half-distance he was nearer the rear than the front.
No one would have taken 1000 to 1 about his chance
then, and in running round the field and coming up
the straight at a speed which carried him within a
couple of lengths of the leader he did something
very remarkable. His time over the last three fur-
longs must have been phenomenal. Of the others
Pah King, King’s Bounty and Shadowland were con-
spicuously out of it. The very tired Poitrina and
tlie moderate suburban performer Cerise Colors saw
them comfortably home. Running miles in “38” is
a serious business.
Desert Gold is a daisy and one over. The field
in the Autumn Stakes, 11 mile, w.f.a., was just about
as good as can be produced these days. Of the 11
starters at least nine would be in tlie first dozen of
any distance handicap framed in Australia. The
maie made no race of it. Not at any time did she
look anything but a winner, nor at any stage did one
of the others look like arguing the point. The Maori-
lander won by four ’lengths from Thana in “33.”
She could have won by a dozen.
Last year Scobie came over from Melbourne with
Thrice and annexed the best of £5OOO by winning-
the Sires Produce Stakes and the Champagne. This
year James Wilson appeared with Outlook and did
it again, and then sold tlie juvenile money-spinner
to Seobie, acting for S. P. Mackay, for £5OOO. Tlie
eolt won both races in rare good style. Yet £5OOO
seems a lot of money to push over all in a heap.
What hits the eye first about this year’s Sydney
Cup is that there were four imported horses in the
race and of these one (Gadabout), joint favorite
with Westcourt, finished without a kick and the
other three concluded first, second and third. The
result sent all the tipsters and dispensers of inside
information and authorities on form clean up in
the air. For the fourth time in six years a rank
outsider took the cash and well-backed favorites
were hopelessly beaten long before the trip was over.
Prince Viridis, after his win in the Leger, carried the
%
hopes of Old King Coal, who also gave Wallace
Isinglass a run. Westcourt and Gadabout were
soundly backed, Red Pennant’s people were confident
that the psychological moment had arrived at last,
and Thana seemed more than a possibility. The
story of what happened is merely about Prince
Viridis running to the front at a mile after Kara-
naud King had got the stitch. With five furlongs
to go the little fellow was well in the picture. At
the turn Rebus ran up and half-way down the
straight had the three-year-old settled and set sail
for the post with a three-lengths lead. At the
Leger Lanins and Shadowland started out to run
him down. They were really fighting for places,
for the leader stuck to his job and ran out a winner
with a good length to spare. The Prince arrived
just behind the tiring Lanius, with old Scoutmaster
and Bronzetti next. The rest were never in the
hunt. The most favored ones finished like Brown’s
cows.
* * # *
The winner of this year’s Sydney Cup was
the longest-priced animal with one exception—-
Moorilln, 1912 —to get away with the proceeds. He
paid a totalisator dividend at the rate of 40 to 1
and in the ring 50 to 1 was on offer. There was
practically not a bean for him. Very few fielders
wrote his name on the course, and the totalisator
investments were obviously those made by the cheer-
ful individuals who go specking for places. To most
double merchants his win came like a gift from
Heaven. The nag’s owner, bookmaker Jack Lemon,
had backed him to win about .£lO,OOO at long
prices a week or two previously, and as John is a
bold fielder he got a nice lift both ways. Itebus
had let him down badly two or three times before,
and Lemon was not among those who gave three
cheers over Cetigne’s win in the Newmarket. But
this time it all came back, and Israel rejoiced and
was exceeding glad.
There was nothing about the appearance, perform-
ances or track work of Rebus to suggest that he
had a hope over two miles. He is a rather mean-
looking customer that had shown exceptional pace
at the end of mile courses and a great facility for
running second. His record and performance on
Monday deserve to be remembered as a very fine
illustration of what may happen in handicaps. In
March of last year Rebus broke his status as a
maiden in a seven-furlong event at Rosehill. In
December he beat two home in the Flying at Canter-
bury Park. In January he ran second at Randwick
to Trinobantes in a Welter Mile and was third in
the Trial Stakes to Assouan and Franzac. Last
month he was just touched off in the last stride
of the Rawson Stakes at Rosehill by Westcourt, and
on Saturday appeared to have had enough before
the last couple of furlongs in the Autumn Stakes
had been covered. The Rosehill effort was not
altogether without merit, but the Autumn Stakes
display was as ordinary as the earlier struggles.
Wherefore it was that the odds lengthened from
15’s away to any old price at the death. The only
person who had any confidence in the winner getting
the journey was probably Z. Murray, who broke
Rebus in as a two-year-old and has handled him
since. Murray, a former pony trainer, never wav-
ered in his belief that the disappointments would
end in a blaze of glory.
* * * *
It is wonderful what a long price can
sometimes be got about a good horse at Randwick
—-provided something else happens to be rushed
with sufficient impetus. The Flying on Monday
gave the opportunity. In this Poitrina, weighted at
9st. 41b., was reckoned a certainty. Had she not
led the Doncaster field for that distance? Of course
she had —and Ike was nearly knocked off his perch
by the crowd that wanted to get on at 6 to 4
and evens. Owing to the hurry very few noticed
that Eulacre was a starter with Bst. 101 b. aboard
or remembered that this mare is a top-class sprinter.
Wherefore 20 to 1 was on offer about a nag that is
as smart over the distance as anything on four
legs around Sydney and carries weight without
grumbling. It was Eulacre* that won and the even-
money chance that collapsed half-way up the
straight.
The totalisators at Randwick handled
£38,877 on Saturday and £57,802 on Monday, an
average of £6479 per- race the first day, when per-
haps fewer than 60,000 people were on the pre-
mises, and £9633 on the second, when somewhere
about 65,000 butted in. These figures show sub-
stantial increase on the last struggle to pick ’em.
That an increase in attendance of many thousands,
mostly of individuals who seldom visit a racecourse,
would push the arithmetic up was natural. But to
speak of the figures as proof of growing popularity
of the 1,2, 3 method among punters is nonsense.
The money that talks at a race meeting was all in
the ring, and on the two days Ike did more business
than ever before on Randwick. Compared with Maori-
land meetings, where there are no books, these
figures, on the basis of attendance, are trumpery;
and if compared with the turnover in Israel they
represent only a fractional part of the cash that was
played up on the course.
On both days the rush of the small bettor to the
machine was enthusiastic and continuous. Long
queues were formed before the pay-in windows opened
on a new race and the curses of the numerous indi-
vidual who was shut out when the event started
were loud and long. On the second day some good
dividends were handed out for 10s. There was
£9 16s. on Eulacre in the Flying, with £7 17s.
on the second nag, Warspite; £2O 12s. on Rebus in
the Cup; £5 3s. on Coominya in the Steeple;
£2O 13s. on Millie Kenilworth in the Nursery,
and £4 ss. on Lordacre in the Tocal Handicap.
As good, and in several cases a long way better,
prices were available from Ike for a win and in the
majority of cases for a place. For instance, in
the Cup Shadowland paid 5 to 2 a place. From
the fielders 4 to 1 was obtainable. Lanius paid
7 to 2 a place; 6 to 1 could be negotiated at the
right place next door. In the Champagne stakes
backers of Outlook on the machine got 3 to 1 for a
win. Dealers with the ring got 4’s and 7 to 2.
Backers of Sweet Lady lost 6d. a ticket when she
ran second. Meantime it may not be long before
it dawns on the A.J.C. or the Government or some-
one that the sooner a straight-out single-dividend is
added to the existing outfit at Randwickf the sooner
will the punter who is there to either win or lose
get a show.
Although their positions at the start may
have a lot to do with the chance of many of the
horses in a Doncaster or Epsom, it is certain that the
best of them are not greatly advantaged, or other-
wise, by the draw. True, it isn’t often that the
favorite wins as Dame Acre did on Saturday, but
the record for the past eight years shows that a
flier down the straight six furlongs at Flemington
is likely to be there or thereabouts in the big mile
race at Randwick a month later. Cetigne, winner
of the Newmarket, carried his extra 121 b. into third
place in the Doncaster. Polycrates, last year,
ran first and second for the same two events. In
the previous year Woorak ran second for both ; but
Woorak, it may be admitted, was a wonder for
rushing to the front however he might have been
situated at the barrier. Jolly Beggar, beaten a head
for the Newmarket of 1913, won the Doncaster the
same year, and Broadsword, in 1911, won the Don-
caster after running third for the Newmarket. Luck
has a comparatively small say in the successes or
failures of the top-notch sprinters. Bad luck couldn’t
stop Cetigne from beating 20 of the crowd last
Saturday.
* * # *
The bookmaker who follows place-betting
can always beat the tote because he stops when he
has laid enough of the favorite, and then gets to
work on the next liorse. The tote doesn’t stop till
the bell goes, and it is here the farce conies in. If
a horse is at 2 to 1 “on,” straight out and wins,
the tote punter forgets that a 9s. 6d. return for fln
outlay of half a quid is generally a good bit more
than he is entitled to when the sum total on the first
three horses is aggregated and his share handed out
on the pro rata basis. Backing odds-on favorites
on a 1 2 3 tote is a brisk way of committing finan-
cial suicide so long as the machine apportions the
winning moneys the way it does. Going back to
the 1 2 with 75 per cent, to the first horse is the
second most-wanted change.

Amongst the bloodstock listed for sale at
Sydney is an imported English two-year-old filly by
Myram out of a mare by a son of Petronel. This
lady introduces a strain of Musket blood that got a
start in England before the big hackney-shaped
Toxopholite horse came here. Petronel (by Musket)
won the 2000 guineas and was contemporary with
Carbine, and it was claimed by the late Bruce Lowe
that these two in their day were the finest living
examples of the No. 2 family. It will be interesting
to students of breeding to see what happens if this
filly later on is put to Mountain King.
A few months ago a well-known and
capable Sydney jock was unshipped for two years
after a flagrant exhibition of interfering with the
intention of his mount to arrive first. Last week a
couple of leaders in the profession were passed out
for two months for “interference.” In these latter
cases the offence consisted of putting impediments
in the way of other riders and nags during a couple
of races at the Hawkesbury. Whatever may be
thought about the two-years penalty there is not
much room for doubt that the two-months sentences
were absurdly lenient. Interference—a gross offence
—is rampant on N. S. Wales courses, and stipes and
trainers and owners know it. Is it likely that
giving a man now and then two months’ holiday will
stop it ?
* Lf%l * * *
A little publication, “Totex,” now on the
market, will help the N.S.W. citizen in deciding
whether to accept the odds on offer by the tote or
take them on the blind and squeak afterwards.
“Totex” shows the dividend on any number of in-''
vestments for first, second or third, whether the
system be one dividend, two, or 1, 2 and 3. For
instance: A punter notices that 4800 tickets have
been sold, of which 1760 are on the horse of his
choice. At 1,2, 3 what are the odds? “Totex”
shows at a glance: 7 to 4 “on” for a win and ss. 6d.
back out of 10s. on 2 and 3. That looks like some-
thing to avoid like poison. Turn to A grand total of
6080 and a horse with 450 investments. There the
odds are 6 to 1 and 6 to 4, and the blood is on your
own head if you make a mistake. “Totex” doesn’t
arm the punter to the teeth, but it is certainly a
useful thing for him to have in his pocket.

repute, the aged gelding Hawkwing, has surprised
his owner, A. J. Lord, by getting over two miles of
the big timber on the “old course” (Victoria Park,

Australia’s old friend J. N. Crawford,

89, 6 for 30. Another bowler thereabouts, W. Brice,
has been assaulting the bails with much emphasis
too. In one match he took 5 for 13 and 7 for 2.

“Bogie”: Alec Wickham, who, as “Prince
M ickyama,” is the big gun in Wren’s ambitious
attempt to kill amateur and quicken professional
swimming in Melbourne, has one trick that puzzles
even such experts as Beaurepaire and Dick Gavill.
He admits that it is a trick, but he keeps the
secret of it, arid has the webfoots guessing. At the
Abbotsford baths a lifebuoy was thrown into the
water, and two strong swimmers were asked to sink
it. Their utmost efforts could not submerge it
more than a foot, and it sprang quickly to the sur-
face. Then Wickham took hold of the buoy, sank
to the bottom with it and did not reappear for 10
seconds.

“Spot” : Captain Alex. Ellis, former sprint
champion of Victoria and Melb. ’Varsity, has been
showing fair pace in France. No championship
medals were awarded him, but he has been handed
a D.S.O. honor to go on with. Alex, was previously
a State-school teacher at Vermont, a few miles out
of Melbourne. Lieut. George Sproule, former Rhodes
scholar and winner a few years back of a champion-
ship for dashing across five miles of Vic. in the
vicinity of Ballarat, was lately handed a Military
Cross. Jack Lamond, a former prominent performer
among the Essendon harriers, turned up again in
Melbourne the other day minus a few lingers and

“Pick”: Geo. L. Hobson, who argues (B.
21/3/’18) that rifle practice is a farce because the
rifleman has sighters and his shots marked, is un-
reasonable. But it would be a farce if a range shooter
practised without learning the results. Dave
McAlister, the King’s winner and champion who
recently went under in France, became expert in all
weathers by being constantly shown on the targets
where his bullets hit. When he made a bad shot
he didn’t let it go at that, but experimented on
until he found out the reason. The talk about
artificial aids and slings is outside the question.
Anyhow, hundreds of expert rifle-shots entirely dis-
card aids, and decline to operate with a rifle except
under service conditions. They judge their altera-
tions of elevation and windage by aiming off the
target, and it is arrant rot to say that in battle
such men would be just as useful had they never tried
to hit the bull in the eye.

A widely-distributed yarn to the effect
that Walter Rutt, the German bikist, who raced in
Australia some years ago, was one of the Hun’s most
intrepid airmen, has been exploded. Rutt, who had
won his phantom reputation on a plane of incredible
size and speed, is stated to be doing’ nothing nioro
desperate than earning a few marks on an indoor
track. It seems that he revealed medical defects
when mobilised in 1914, and was given the billet of,
a chauffeur charged with carting the brains of an
army corps behind the Front. Subsequently he was,
released altogether, on account of lung trouble, and
on partial recovery returned to the bike as the only
means of winning the daily bread and sausage.

The £lBl7 referred to as written off has
long been in suspense. The Commissioner
of Taxes claimed this amount, and the co.
has for many years—over 10 years certainly
—regarded it as an asset by reason
of the appeal of which notice had
been given. As the appeal has been
at last formally abandoned, the item is
struck out of the assets. The co. has been
suffering pretty badly from the disturbance
of oversea shipping. Adelaide is a few
hundred miles off the track from Fremantle
to Melbourne, and to a great extent has been
cut out; even the State’s reinforcements are
mostly embarked at Melbourne. For the 3|
years since June, 1914, the net profit has
been £5158; in the 31 years preceding the
war it was £24.912. And probably some
even of the profit of £3882 shown as made
in the last half-year isn’t true profit.: at any
rate, the directors transfer £lBOl of it
to a special reserve. But so far as one can
judge the directors haven’t been tempted to
improve the look of things by neglecting to
write off profits against depreciation. This
shows another aspect:—

Liabilities . . . . 1,477 913 1,237
Surplus ..£32,156 £29,432 £37,345
In the first 31-year period, however, a steam
lighter that cost about £17.000 was bought
for the Broken Ilill flux trade ; while during
the last 31 years three or four small lighters
have been sold —two of them during the last
term, which no doubt explains some of the
recent improvement in the cash position.
Still, as indicating that, as suggested above,
depreciation hasn’t been neglected, the steam
lighter has been written down during the
last 31 years from £16,761 to £14,087. And
the war won’t last for ever.

Before 1912 shares were all of one denomi-
nation. For many years they had carried
10 p.c. and the co. was in the habit of
showing anything up to £15,000 surplus
profits, which was considerably more than
the dividend amounted to in those days.
But the true profits were less than the
directors probably thought they were at the
time; and when they had to face the ques-
tion of remodelling their plant and found
that it would be better to build new works
and dismantle the old, the directors were
faced with a very big writing down. The
table shows that in two years over £56,000
of the reserves were discovered to be no
longer represented by assets. And there
would have been more than that to write off
if the directors hadn’t written up the land
by £34,000 to make it tally with the Gov-
ernment’s modern valuation. Taught by the
past the directors are now establishing a
depreciation fund and declare that it is
necessary to put by £ll,OOO a year, on the
basis, apparently, that gas plant has an
average life of 25 years. It is a compli-
cated business. Probably it is a fact that
the average life is as stated. But it is
practically indefinite if the co. charges re-
pairs and renewals up to revenue account
year by year. If this co. pays for renewals
out of revenue, as most cos. do, then there
is no justification for further charging
revenue with a large sum for depreciation.
Prudence calls for nothing more than the
laying by of a comparatively small sum to
provide for special replacements. For the
present, therefore, the £11,398 set aside last
year is included in the table as profit and
therefore as a reserve. Then there is a
further £lO.OOO which has been transferred
from P. and L. to a reserve for taxation
1918-19. a.s revenue account has already
been charged with the past year’s rates and
taxes (£13,615). the £lO.OOO must plainly
be included with the year’s profits and be
shown with the reserves.
So the co. has not done badly during the
year, takinsr into account the high price of
coal and local labor disturbances —better
than the ordinary shareholders might have
supposed when they found their div. cut down
by half. (P»y the way, it will be noticed
that the 1915 div. called for a less amount
than usual. That was because the directors
deducted income tax in the second half of
that year.) Of course things wouldn’t have
worked out so well as thej> did if the price
of gas hadn’t been lately pushed up from ss.
to 6s. Bd. As, however, the last Is. 3d. was
only put on in October, the co. had for most
of the year the benefit of only an extra sd.
on the old ss. rate. What the extra coal-
bill was isn’t ascertainable: unlike big Aus-
tralian cos. tlrs one lumps its receipts and
also its outgoings. But this year’s prices
are not likely to be so much in excess of
last year’s that the extra Is. 3d. won’t give
the co. a pretty fair return. Five per cent,
isn’t a fair return, especially as many of
the shares have been bought from the co.
at a premium. ------

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped,
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
1107: No, and the people over here are not
to be allowed to know, either. The things that made
the majority of the rank and file vote “No” also
make them anti-recruiters in Australia; yet, though
the Government professes to want to know why
recruiting is now a failure, it won’t allow Billjim to
say why he voted No, which would also explain the
other thing. The most informing article The
Bulletin ever saw on the subject was censored....
John O’N.: Look again. “Firefly” wasn’t throwing
bricks at the colored man who accepted the child,
but at the white crowd (Government included) who
had no use for it... .Stylo: Good subject, but too
rough in places. Try it again... .Ileah lleah:
Hasn’t a hope of getting through... .The New Poet:
Obvious fake. How do you know how to punctuate
j'our letter if you can’t write better than that?....
W.E.8.: Glad to know he’s “happy among the angles.”
Personally we should prefer to be among the curves.
. ...1.M.L.: Poor verse... .J.R.: If the Standard
prints that we suppose it deserves t 0... .It.A.: Sorry ;
no use. .. .M.H.M.: Get her to write of something
she knows about. Short-story writing can’t be
taught. The people who profess to teach it arc
frauds... .W.H.L.: Not up... .P.W.: The verse spoils
it... .M. 8.5.: Very lame stuff... .T.W.S.: You want
to know its weakest spot. It is all weakest....
C.D.S.: Avaunt.... M.W.: We don’t reprint and
wouldn’t have it if it was original. ... E. 0.: Not
enough meat there... .H.W.S.: “Mathinna” is poor
stuff. The sonnets are good, but not good enough....
V. 8.: Not nearly up... .Mag: Verse too rugged and
idea small. . . .Yvonne: Bumps badly. . . .8.C.:
“Trails” not up.... A.D.8.: Doesn’t grip anywhere.
. ...H.1.M.: Sorry,- but hardly enough interest....
K.W.: Not enough to carry it past the basket....
1t.M.8.: When did yon ever see anything like that
in this paper?... .J.M.: “First Appearance” and
“Orders” very poor. . . .E.R.P.: Nothing at all there.
. ...L.R.: “One Man's Story” is a painful attempt
to show that snobbery is better than misery....
C.D.C.: Sorry, but it is not improved.... E.E.: “The
Gallant” doesn’t convey any clear picture or story.
....C.D.C.: That “nobly”-“see” rhyme smashes it
from the first stanza.... K.S.: “Dinkum Mate”
doesn’t thrill... .Kewpie: The “Politician” may be
nolTle ; but. the verse shouldn’t wobble and bump like
that. .. .Gunner Kum: It doesn’t raise a smile....
1L8..J.: Sorrowful series of prosy jumps. .. .Brrundie:
The “editor of the Bible” couldn’t easily decide
whether to put it in the Book of Lamentations or the
basket. The basket scored.... Uloola: Not im-
proved ....Z.P.: Pleasing, but rather thin. . . .W.W.:
You’ll have to learn the game. This is very crude
stuff... .Ephraim: And do you really think it
humorous that a girl in Palestine should blow her
nose?... .O.B.: A fine tribute to a noble creature: —
As you all know, and are quite aware,
That we have so many slaves on our Continent;
To do their work and more than their share,
Of which we know they are quite competent.
For the slaves we know are the splendid old draughts,
The horse we see every day in harness and shafts ;
A nobler animal there never was to stick to his
graft;
Put him where you like he works as straight as a
shaft.
Now this noble animal he has always been our best
friend ;
May he ever be blest until his end, at rest.
For he is the best of all to recommend.
As he has proved himself to be one of the best.
. ...J.T.C.: Not nearly up....J.N.: Crude....
G.S.: “Zoob” doesn’t thrill. .. .A.D.: Miserable
stuff... .J.H.: They’re pretty enough; but you must
get to grips with something that matters... .Jon-
murra : Weak. . . .M.E.P.H.: Just the usual sort....
J.M.P.: Sestet has two false lines. .. .8.K.: You
say “Hearing that you wanted a person to compose
poetry for your paper I thought I would like to offer
myself.” Sorry; but on the sample we couldn’t
accept the sacrifice, though we like your name and
handwriting. ... L.C.: (1) Results of Photo-play
Scenario competition will be announced on Red
Page as soon as completed. (2) If stamps have been
affixed to MS. unsuitable MS. will be returned.
....Mrs. Percy Xernot: Red Page would be obliged
if you forwarded a copy of the book for review. It
would be returned.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.C.M.: Sorry can’t use any of second batch....
Eric T.: Yes, pockets were invented for young
artists to hide their subjects’ hands in. ... J.R.L.:
No value here. .. .C.S.: You lose yourself in detail
and get outlines wrong. .. .J.M.: Not a winner....
F.M.: An also ran... .T.R.W.: Our regrets... .Miro:
Idea is unsuitable, drawing is uncertain and pink
lettering on a black-and-white production is out of
place. .. .Jack D.: A few years’ earnest study re-
quired. Seems worth it. . . .D.C.: Far too rough....
P. 8.: First experiments, aren’t they? Give yourself
time. .. .Bert E.: One poor jest doesn't seem to war-
rant two bad illustrations. .. .Masters: Old stock idea
feebly treated.
It is time somebody in authority took the
Eastern Extension Cable Co. into a quiet
corner and asked what it has to say about it.
Five or six weeks now commonly elapse
between the acceptance of a message and
its delivery; and this doesn’t help recruiting.
Everything that adds to the distress and
anxieties of the Australian parents of sol-
diers in Europe is an obstacle to enlistment;
wherefore it is time somebody or other was
kicked good and hard.
The anti-strike part of N.S.W.’s latest
Industrial law condensed :
Any union that strikes without giving 14 days’
notice may be fined than £5Ol, which will per-
haps mean 6d.
Any person who instigates or abets an illegal
strike may be fined less than £5l (possibly 4d.).
Any newspaper which encourages an illegal strike
may be fined less than £lOl (say eighteenpence).
Picketing, etc., may lead to a fine of less than
£lO Is. This may pan out at 9d.
Any union or individual declaring a commodity
“black” may be fined less than £lOO Is. and £lO
Is. respectively. This may signify 2sd. in each case.
If the responsible Minister refuses to prosecute he
will be fined nothing.
If he systematically remits penalties he will be
fined the same.
The Bulletin suspects that the whole
thing is vanity.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Hough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease. In
Anaemia—or bloodlessness—
the red corpuscles are more
or less deficient. Thus the
blood cannot provide suffi-
cient nourishment for the
body. Therefore the face
becomes white and “ pasty ”
the eyes become dull and
“heavy”—and a feeling of
intense weariness perradis
the whole system. To over-
come Anaemia, the blood
supply needs recharging with
red corpuscles. And it is
here that

Perfection at last!
The world’s famous artists need no longer be misrepresented by
inferior imitations of their finest efforts.
The NEW EDISON
does full justice to the most perfect voice, re-creating to the
extreinest degree all the overtones upon which all music is
dependent for its sweetness.
This marvellous instrument, so different from ordinary talking-
machines, omits in its reproduction no shade of expression or detail
of technique, but presents the work of the artist as though he
or she were actually present.
The NEW EDISON stands m much the same relation to the
student and lover of the highest forms of musical art as the Art
Gallery does to the aspiring painter; the advantage being with the
musician who can have one of these superb instruments always at
hand.
You ought to get The NEW EDISON for YOUR home.

“Fax”: The late Chung Ling Soo, the
Seotch-American, killed on the stage in
London, was the most unassuming of show-
men, both on and off the stage. It was
his quiet mock-Chinese method of working
his illusions and tricks that counted as his
chief asset, whilst his legerdemain feats in
private seemed the more uncanny because
the conjurer had no professional frills about
him. I happened in at The Bulletin
“ Pierrotland ,” at
Sydney Playhouse.
W. P. Turner supplies
some patter.
office in Sydney
one midday to find
that he had dropped
in, too, among the
linotypes and was
giving the boys a
show of their own.
To see Soo stick
little bits of paper
on either side of
the blade of a table
knife with saliva,
and then make
them disappear and
reappear as though
by magic, was to
marvel at the cas-
ualness of the
man’s dexterity.
Strange that the
two most likeable
conjurers in Aus-
tralian records
should both have
died of gun acci-
dents. Dante was
f a tally wounded
whilst out rabbit
shooting in N. S.
Wales. Chung Ling
Soo was shot in
the ordinary way
of conjuring busi-
ness, probably by an accidental missile in the
barrel of a gun which was supposed to be
unloaded.
“M.P.A.” from the inside: —
Chung Ling Soo was William E. Robinson in pri-
vate life. He used to be chief mechanist to
Herman the Great, the finest illusionist of his day.
In the profession Robinson was known as a top-
notcher behind the curtain long before he became
a performer. As a matter of fact he jumped the
original Ching Ling Foo out of the business
by collaring his fair-dinkum C'how tricks and
improving on them, having a better grip of the
mechanical end of the business. The real China-
man was, however, a marvel at the legitimate
sleight of hand and the smaller-apparatus stuff,
which required very skilful handling. Robinson
Soo made a tour of the Asia coast last year, and
had arranged to come to Australia for the Fullers. Rut
things went all to pieces with him. He lost his
assistants, a very serious matter for a performer of
his class. Besides, he was getting very nervy.
Chung did the Linking Rings, Rice Bowls, Gold
.Fish and all the accepted Chinese hanky-panky;
hut his long suit with the public was the bullets
fired by volunteers from the audience and caught
on a plate. The Ham Fats with the guns had to
be watched closely lest they should slip a swan-drop
or a piece of metal down the barrel. Some of ’em
thought he could really catch the lead. After
Cluing left Australia Ilugarde went out on the road
with a Chow show and the bullet-catching act, and
he found he had the same' trouble with the mugs,
who were always trying to slip a chunk of some-
thing in the gun. Perhaps it was in this way some
fool caused the little chap’s death.
Chung Ling Soo, always experimenting, devoted
a good deal of time trying to place me under
hypnotic influence, so that he could make me sway
backwards or forwards while preserving my bal-
ance. In return I had the pleasure to teach him a
throw in three-card monte that he had never
before seen. lie was a fine showman out of the
theatre. In meeting amateur conjurers he was
always kindly and encouraging, but was death on
pirates and cribbers, though most of his own acts
were a Chinaman’s, and he even pirated the Chink’s
name. lie never forgave Caleb Cheong, of Mel-
bourne, who toured with him in Australia and subse-
quently joined Ilugarde, because Ilugarde was work-
ing his (Soo's) business. Claude Guest, who did
several mechanical jobs for Soo, subsequently put
a Chinese act together and later went on the Fuller
circuit. Guest worked as Wong Toy Sun, and any-
where except in Australia his act would have made
the public take notice. Unfortunately for Guest
he was too well known as an Australian from Middle
Park. Guest was a pupil of the late Arthur Rus-
sell, the founder of Hoyt's Pictures, and a pal of
Soo’s. Chung’s wife worked in his act. She is a
very little woman —a German-American.
“T. 0.1.”: In February, 1913, veteran J.P.
West, who has just passed out, wrote me a
sort of good-bye letter in which, amongst other
things, he told how he became an actor. It
was in 1856, when G. V. Brooke was play-
ing in Sydney. At that time Andy Donohoe
(Sheil Barry) and himself frequented the
pit of the theatre at which Brooke played,
coming in at half-time and at half-price—a
system long since discontinued. Soon they
made a friend of a door-keeper, who managed
to get them in earlier. After seeing Brooke
as Othello, they made up their minds that
they would be actors, and accordingly con-
sulted W. 11. Stephens, a comedian, then
lessee of the York-street Theatre, where the
Sisters Gougenheim were playing. Stephens
heard them, told Andy that his forte was
comedy and West (otherwise Devine) that
his was tragedy. He advised them to get a
number of friends together and form an ama-
teur dramatic circle- So the Kemble Club
was formed, West being general- and stage-
manager. Amongst the members were Dono-
hoe, Al. Park, Billy O’Brien (who as a pro.
called himself Stafford), J. Shaw (drowned
a few months later), William Kennedy, J.
Lucy, George Bowden, Thomas Golden and
others, about 23 in all. Amongst the ladies
was Julia Corcoran, sister of Kate, a popu-
lar favorite of the time. At the same time
another club was playing, The Garrick, of
which the late William Andrews, comedian,
was the head. Their place in Sussex-street
was called The Theatre of Arts. Presently
the clubs shared this theatre, taking three
nights each. The Garricks played “The Lady
of Lyons” ; The Kembles “Virginius,” with
J. P. West in the title-role and Donohoe in
the east, the first appearance of the pair on
any stage. Al. Park, who, I think, is now
the sole survivor (at any rate, he had a sort
of billet in the Taxation Department not
long ago), played Appius Claudius and Miss
Corcoran was Virginia. J. P. West said
they all considered themselves G. V. Brookes
that night. A few months after this show’
J. L. Byers took West with him to Maitland,
where he played juvenile lead. Returning co
Sydney he joined Julia Mathews and } rought
some of his amateur friends, including Dono-
hoe, to support her. Crossing Hyde Park
one night to Wolloomooloo, Devine and Dono-
hoe sat down on the steps of old St. Mary’s
and discussed a change of name. Devine rose
up J. P. West and Andy Donohoe thenceforth
was Shiel Barry. The latter when he
flourished proved very ungrateful to both his
early friends, W. H. Ford and J. P. West.
The yarns of an old campaigner:—
l would point out to “Mat” (B. 21/3/’18) that all
the European theatres in India have special boxes
with mosquito and other blinds for zenana ladies.
While playing Chung Ling Soo at the Excelsior
Theatre, Bombay, we reserved the whole of the boxes
and dress-circle for the Nizam of Hyderabad and his
300 wives, etc. All the boxes were curtained off, and
while the harem was being drafted into the seats
there was enough giggling and chatter to cause any
fretful actress to smash a hundred mirrors. Things
were just settling down again when the mysteries
of the illusionist got too much for the women, and
a riot nearly happened, the discovery being made that
they were lifting the netting to get a better view,
and thus exposing themselves —a very serious offence
for a native woman of high caste. While giving a
special private performance of Government war films
to the wives of a Maharajah in Kashmir, we had to
fix the sheet in the hall of the palace. Attendants
drove nails into most gorgeous mosaic pillars, which
vandalism didn’t seem to worry anybody but our-
selves. The operator was locked in the box until
the women were all seated, and was kept there while
the hall was being cleared. When it was discovered
that some inquiring wife had cut a hole in the
sheet to find out where 11le figures came from, the
Maharajah was very upset and gave me a cheque
for rupees 750 ( £5O) to get a new sheet. Wish I
could find a few more specs like that.

“Digger,” from Salisbury Plain:—
In mid-January Julius Knight, his best Beaucaire
smile, an opossuni-skin coat and three helpers,
reached our camp at the foot of “The Pimple” to
entertain us with a three-act comedy, “The Mollusc.”
Even Ikey’s November birthday party at Flemington
could not draw a crowd so territorially representa-
tive of the Commonwealth as that which the ushers
packed into tlie Y.M.C.A. hut that night. The little
shoulder-colors of battalions from every State could
be picked out. Young officers gave the welcome an
Anzac touch by bringing Sister Maoriland along
from the, hospital, further round “The Pimple,” and
beyond the spot where the Aussies have carved a
huge rising-sun badge deep into the hillside to re-
mind future Englanders of our share in Hun sup-
pression. Julius pleased mightily. Even a Major
who is just out of his teens told the actor that the
show “was better than we generally get.”
For several minutes Julius had to stand and wait
before he could say “Bojs, I. am glad to be with
you. I hope to meet you again ; if not here, out in
our own sunny Australia.” The bed-boards seemed
softer that night.
“Macko”: A small theatrical co. was
showing in our town. A married couple,
playing the heavy and adventuress respect-
ively, had a squabble off-stage, and the
frenzied female determined to upset her part-
ner in his great scene where the lines were
as follows: —
He (firmly) : “You had a child.”
She (looking away): “Yes!” '
Whereupon the man goes ahead with his fat
speech. This was what happened:—
He (grabbing her savagely by the wrist and hiss-
ing): “You had a child!”
She (sarcastically, and wrenching her arm free) :
“I think not!”
He (ignoring the trap): “Well, think again!”
She thought and had it.
“Masetto”: The claim that “Prince
Wickyama’s” dive of 205 feet into the Yarra
is the best on record makes me put
in a claim for the
late Charles Peart,
who was killed in
Sydney 20 years
ago, through strik-

ing exl) i b i tions,
and, flushed with
success after a

“J.F.H.” (London) : Five o’clock in the
afternoon is an unearthly hour for the pro-
duction of a new play, yet it was the one
chosen for launching “Loyalty” at St.
James’s. The strictly anonymous author was
alleged to be a high personage in the politi-
cal world, and there had been so much
guessing about it all that it had come to
be known as the “mystery play.” In the
best-informed quarters Sir F. E. Smith.
K.C., the Attorney-General, is the reputed
author. A large contingent of the Commons
turned up to lend an applauding hand to
what they no doubt all believed to be the
work of a clever and much-admired col-
league. The St. James’s is one of the most
old-fashioned theatres in London, and pos-
sesses only two private boxes. One of them
was occupied by Asquith, Mrs. Asquith and
a family party; the other by Mrs. Lloyd
George and a group of friends. Lloyd
George intended to be present, but urgent
war business kept him elsewhere. “Loyalty”
turned out to be talk, talk, talk, with
hardly anything in the nature of dramatic
action or plot. The characters are divided
into two opposing sets, pacifists and loyal-
ists, and the author has prepared exhaust-
ive briefs for both sides. They argue and
answer one another just as if they were in
court —good talk at times, but far too much
of it. Most of the palaver takes place in
the editorial office of the New Standard,
a pacifist paper, whose proprietor is con-
verted from the error of his ways by the
martyrdom of his own son at the hands of
the Huns. Of course at curtain fall the
pacifists are routed by facts and arguments
and the loyalists finish up with a triumph-
anP' cock-a-doodle-do and a sworn determi-
nation to knock out the Kaiser at all costs.
War has meant something more than Red
Cross matinee performances for Mrs. Pat
Campbell. Her first husband was killed in
the S’African War. Their son, Lieut.-Com-
mander Alan Campbell, fell in action three
months ago.
From London :
London’s oldest and most historic theatre, Drury
Lane, has had a bad year. At the annual meeting of
shareholders a loss of £5901 was reported. The
chairman said the new entertainment tax had hit them
very badly, and he was afraid still worse was loom-
ing. The tax had driven many people from the higher-
priced seats to the cheaper parts and had caused
them to visit the theatre less frequently. The stop-
page of private motor-cars and the severe restrictions
on the use of taxis had also militated against them,
and a further adverse influence was the raising of
railway fares by 50 per cent. Nevertheless, in spite
of all, Old Drury burst out into its customary gor-
geous panto., with Australia’s own Madge Titheradge
as principal boy. Nellie Stewart was principal boy
at this house 20 years ago, but she broke down in
the middle of the season. Panto, at Drury Lane is
no .joke. Two performances a day—from 1.30 till
5.30 and 7 to 11.

When you buy your next
car, consider the trans-
action an investment.
Use the same care and
caution in making this
investment that you
would if you were going
to spend or more
in any other investment.
Farseeing people who buy
cars as an investment
buy cars with a reputa-
tion like the Studebaker.
They buy them with a
clear view of the ultimate
return.
Almost any car runs good
and looks good, and is
good, in its fresh paint
and shining metal work
when it is new. Consider
it six months later —a
year later or two years
•—and on this basis the
Studebaker IS a sound
investment.
The original cost is mod-
erate ; if you want to sell
your Studebaker later on
the price on a. used
Studebaker is as high in
proportion to first cost
as any car in the world
—much higher than
most.
Of much importance is a
car’s durability —that
quality in the car which
keeps it running month
after month, and year
after year, at low up-keep
cost. This quality in the
Studebaker has made it
the selection of the mail-
contractor, the taxi-cab
driver, the commercial
user, where a car must
stand up day after day
and give continuous,
uninterrupted service.
Th rough shortage of ship-
ping our stocks are not
being replenished, and
no more shipments are *
expected before August;
so if you want your
money’s worth select your
Studebaker while stocks
are available.
Stocks of Studebaker Cars are at present held by our State distributors and by 200 Studebaker dealers throughout A ustralia and New Zealand.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amspkll, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
Grey Hair-—Home Remedy.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable, and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you should
have grey hair if you do not want it. To turn
the hair back to a natural color is really a
very simple matter. One has only to get from
the chemist two ounces of concentrate of tam-
malite and mix it with three ounces of bay
rum. Apply to the hair with a small sponge
for a few nights and the greyness will gradu-
ally disappear. This liquid is not sticky or
greasy, and does not injure the hair in any
way. It. has been used for generations with
most satisfactory results by those who have
known the formula.
Blackheads Fly Away.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into gen-
eral use in the boudoir. It is very simple,
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler full of
hot water. After the effervescence lias sub-
sided bathe in the liquid, using a
small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
come right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at, intervals of four or five days
to ensure the permanence of the result.
Emergency Complexions.
Even a complexion which is hopelessly dull
or greasy can be made beautiful in a moment
by a perfectly harmless home recipe. If you
have no cleminite in the house, get about an
ounce from your chemist, and add only
enough water to dissolve it. The process de-
fies detection, and the result is an immediate
appearance of velvety, youthful “bloom”
which every woman desires. The effect will
last all day under the most trying conditions,
indoors or out, and renders powdering quite
unnecessary. This simple substance is also
very good for the skin, and no possible harm
can come from its regular use.
Effectually Killing Superfluous Hair.
Many women know how to remove ugly
growths of superfluous hair temporarily, but
few kwow how to remove it permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered plieminol may be
used. Get about an ounce from your chemist
and apply a little directly to the objection-
able hair. The purpose of the recommended
treatment is not merely to remove the super-
fluous hair instantly, but also to kill the hair
roots completely in a comparatively short
time.
How Nature Makes New Complexions.
It is well known that the human skin is
constantly undergoing a tearing down and
building up process. With advancing years or
waning vitality this tissue-change lags: the
lifeless, soiled surface skin stays on so long
that its owner gets a “poor complexion.”
Commonsense tells us this dead skin cannot
be enlivened or beautified by any cosmetic,
lotion or powder. The natural thing to do is
to actually remove the offensive skin—remove
the bad complexion It has been found that
ordinary mercolized wax completely absorbs
the devitalised skin, in minute particles, so
gently, gradually, as to cause no inconveni-
ence. Mercolized wax, which any chemist can
supply, is put on at night like cold cream,
and washed off in the morning. If you would
have a brilliantly beautiful and youthful com-
plexion, just use this simple treatment.
How to Have Thick and Pretty Hair.
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved
in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair bril-
liant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp com-
pletely, and greatly stimulates the hair-
growtli. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the
chemist only in sealed quarter-pound pack-
ages. which retail at about four shillings.
However, as this is sufficient for 25 or 30
shampoos, it really works out very cheaply
in the end. H
It was a railway guard, Riordan, who at
last shifted the Independent party from the
Queensland Assembly. For years past the
entire caucus of the Independent party has
consisted of W. S. Murphy, of Burke, the
last, lone remnant of a crowd that once was
strong enough to run a fairly stable Gov-
ernment. Riordan is a brother of the M.L.C.
who is Queensland president of the A.W.U.
We have moved a little. When John
Redmond visited Sydney in 18S3 to advo-
cate Home Rule, he couldn’t get a theatre
or hall in which to hold his meetings, preju-
dice ran so high. At length the lessees of
the old Scandinavian Hall in Castlereagh-
street agreed to let it, but only on condition
that £lOO was put up to cover damages in
the expected row. There was no row, of
course, and Bernard Gaffney, the guarantor,
didn’t have to “part.”
“Pull-through’s” grievance:—
The Home Service man who does his little bit,
carrying a rifle on guard, thereby releasing a younger
man to go to the big scrap, is not getting a fair deal.
One such, who had exceptional Boer War papers,
fought for 18 months to be allowed to go, but was
two years over the limit. On such good fighting
papers as he carried he was, however, placed in the
Permanent Guard. After six months he was invalided.
The Government paid him for the month he was off.
He then went back to work and put in another six
months, mostly night duty, when a breakdown sent
him once more into the hospital for three weeks. Dur-
ing that time his pay was cut in halves: his wife
and four kiddies had to live and pay rent on 3s. lid.
per day. Now, I say this: nobody would dream of
docking Bigjohn, though he has been off his job
half his time for a year past; why, then, this other
public servant? For no other reason than that one is
a very poor man of no “social” consequence, while
the other is rich and a baron.
Two wounded Anzacs, John W. Henderson
and John M. Stone, were invalided home
soon after the Evacuation and discharged.
Henderson had a mind to become a civil
engineer and go for a degree, but found that
unless he could take the day course and give
all his time to his studies the Melbourne
“shop” could do nothing for him. The two
mates decided to see what Woodrow Wilson’s
country could offer them. They struck Pitts-
burg (Pa.) first and found the classes in
recess. But the college authorities reckoned
these were two young men worth looking
after, so they found them jobs at £3 3s. a
week. When the term opened they were
provided with billets in the Westinghouse
Brake works at £5 ss. a week each and ad-
mitted to the college courses. That was in a
Protectionist country run by men of action,
not by muddlers filled with gassy schemes
warranted to achieve nothing but their own
unearned salaries.
“Lahma”: The drivers in the big Pales-
tine hunt accomplished wonders, keeping
ever on the heels of the mounted men. The
Tommies have adopted many of our horse-
saving ideas; but after the first week the
difference was increasingly apparent. Bill-
jim’s strong points were (1) letting the
animals pick their pace, (2) driving as
much and as many from the box as possible,
(3) successful foraging, and (4) making hos-
tile Bedouins disclose the concealed wells.
Even then the teams often worked without
water 50 and 60 hours, and in odd cases 72.
But the Bedouin quickly learnt that a slouch
hat and perishing horses spelt brimstone
unless water was promptly discovered.
“Centurion”: “Whist,” in saying (B.
14/3/T8) that a man never hears the shell
that gets him, is out. You can hear a
howitzer projectile coming long before it
arrives, and since even a Gin. howitzer shell
makes a row like an express train, only a
deaf ’un could possibly miss the tip. Some,
not all, of the high-velocity field-guns,
notably the French 75, deliver the goods in
a terrible hurry. Even then, if the fire is
light enough for one to hear the gun, there is
often time enough to drop. With many guns
in action, the chance is, of course, wiped
out. The quickest thing I have met was a
Turkish battery of anti-aircraft guns, which
were used for ground shooting in the rear-
guard action at Bir-el-Abd, in Sinai, after
the smash-up at Romani. They fired four
101 b. shells in quick succession, h.e. and
shrapnel alternately, and the shells arrived
at the same time, practically, as the sound.
“Tarago”: The returned Billjim who lives
in the bush finds a few awkward corners to
turn when he comes to the Vic. State War
Council. One of him arrived there lately
and put his name on the card for a job. A
weary staff-sergeant handed him a paper to
fill in with his military history; then de-
manded his discharge to verify the particu-
lars. Tvyo hours later the applicant’s name
was called and more questions were asked
as to his credentials. These being satisfac-
tory, the clerk told him that he would have
to report twice weekly until the job was
forthcoming. Billjim wanted to know how
thell a man living in Backrabingy could
report twice weekly in Melbourne. The
clerk said he didn’t know, but unless this
condition could' be carried out Bill’s name
would have to be struck off the roll. Bill
told him to strike, and left. The same thing
applies to monetary assistance. Returned
men-domiciled in the city can get up to £2 per
week; but how is a man in the bush, on a
pension of, say 7s. Od. weekly, to receive the
same help? In many cases it would not be
worth his while to borrow his railway fare
and apply (requisitions for concession fares
are only supplied at the city end). Under
these restrictions it would be more honest to
stipulate the bush out of bounds, A.W.L. or
something. All returned men cannot live in
the city on their militiary pensions—with
the counter lunches cut out.
“Try Fluke’s” illustrious friend :
In a M.L. Hot Lakes settlement there is a patrician
brown lady of 65 known as “The Duchess.” When
the Duke of Edinburgh toured the Rotorua country
in 1870, under Arawa military escort, the lady,
being the pick of the tarts in the kianga, was
selected by the tribe to entertain the “Tiuka.”
That was the customary Maori courtesy to a guest
whom the tribe delighted to honor. When the
Galatea sailed from M.L. the tribe regarded the
Duchess as a pearl of infinite price; and the old
lady is still willing to talk of the great event of
her life.

forcibly is the thoroughness of its construction* The smallest bolt or nut
has the same great factor of safety for its work as the massive frame or
the sturdy axle.
Denbv trucks, therefore, are practically immune from the so-called minor
troubles that do so much to affect the satisfactory service of a motor-truck.
And Denby trucks will carry their maximum load in any kind of going at
a remarkably low petrol consumption.

“Block 10”: At present N. S. Wales Edu-
cation Dept, is supplying a Senior Geogra-
phy by A. «T. Herbertson to High School stu-
dents, and is also recommending the same
•work as a text-book for teachers. Here are
a few gems from the Australian section:—
Gold is mined at Goulburn in the Bine Mountains.
Owing to many sunken reefs and islands it [i.e.,
the water inside the Barrier Beef] can only be navi-
gated by day or with the aid of a powerful search-
light at night.
The main Southern Railway (N.S.W.) follows the
coast to the lllawarra, ascends the Blue Range, a.nd
sends branches to the goldfields of Bathurst and Gold-
burn. These unite farther west and follow the base
of the Eastern Highlands, crossing the Murray at
Albury.
Will someone tell me how contracts for the
supply of such books are obtained?
“J.F.H.” (London) : The London Mis-
sionary Society announces that it has ap-
proved the formation of a company or asso-
ciation to take over and develop on industrial
lines the district of Kwnti in Papua. As
this district was assigned to the Congrega-
tional body for missionary purposes, it is a
bold and highly contentious proposition.
Capital to the amount of £lO,OOO is to be
raised and a Board of Directors is to be
appointed, some of whom, it is added, will
be residents of Australia. The new associa-
tion is to have five aspects —moral and spirit-
ual, medical, educational, mechanical and
agricultural. The experiment is defended
on the ground that “the Papuan race _is
threatened with extinction through the im-
pact of Western civilisation, and the new
scheme is designed to meet this crisis by de-
veloping the industrial work that has been
carried on for some years by the missionaries
at Ivwati.” The Papuan boys are to be
taught “boat-building and other mechanical
crafts,” and how to cultivate cocoanuts, while
the girls will be initiated into the mysteries
of laundry, plain and fancy sewing and the
manufacture of basket-ware. The London
Missionary Society alleges that the scheme
has been carefully planned and tested, and
has received the endorsement of two ex-
Governors of Papua—Maegregor and Le
Ilunte.
The Defence Department, like the Edu-
cation Department, is piling up a fine store
of quaint records in the shape of letters from
the unlettered ladies of the land. Billjim s
missus is very sincere, especially in regard
to Jimbill’s back pay. Samples :

am I to do to get his back pay, or his Father will

Officer in charge Sir—About that medal for my
brother which you say you have given to his mother,
you make us sine our names before a witness and you

Once there was a far-seeing servant-girl
named Sarah Bouncer. She was inclined to
pessimism and always had an eye to the
future. One day she was missing when she
should have been cooking the dinner, and
there was but a scrambling meal that night
in the family of Billjim. After three hours
intermittent search Sarah was found pros-
trate with grief in the darkest part of the
coal cellar. Between her sobs she explained
things. It had occurred to her that some
day she might get married, despite her
homely countenance, and become the mother
of a family. Also that she and her husband
might go to live on the edge of a river, and
the baby might fall in and be drowned, and
Sarah saw in imagination the little corpse
laid out on the table in the living-room, and
as a result she was too broken-spirited to
work. Sarah would have made a good Fed-
eral Prime Minister —the kind who is full
of alarm lest Australia shouldn’t be properly
organised to take commercial and industrial
advantage of the great peace that will follow
when the great war is won. As Prime
Minister Sarah would naturally get so busy
building a huge new department to ad-
vise about getting our frozen rabbit to Eng-
land in 1920 that she wouldn't have time to
find men and ships in 1918 to help in assur-
ing that there will be any rabbit or any 1920
so far as we are concerned.
“Silas Snell”: This is a true and touch-
ing story of gratitude. Last Christmas seven
nurses attached to various private hospitals
in this city (wherever it is) went out to
camp in the hills and the trees by the run-
ning brooks, and all that sort of thing. The
picnic was for women only, and the under-
standing was that if the animal man should
turn up he must “get brusher.” _ On the sec-
ond day Mary found a man in the creek
whence they drew their water. This was an
intrusion; but as the man had all the
symptoms of the apparently drowned the
point was not urged. The other girls were
called and the rules for the restoration of
people found in creeks were applied. Then
Henry was put to bed. They called him
Henry because that was the name inscribed
on somebody else’s shirt which he happened
to be wearing. The nurses kept Henry in
bed for five days, nursing, feeding and com-
forting him, at the end of which time the
restoring process was a triumphant success.
Meanwhile the girls, having burnt Henry’s
shocking clothes, as the most efficacious way
of removing a nuisance, had clubbed together
and bought him a new slop suit. It being
time for Henry to get up and get, he pre-
sently came forth in his new plumage, a
renovated man, and stood before his benefac-
tresses with a frowning brow, displaying
himself in angry protest. “See here, yous,”
he snorted, “these ain’t me own clothes. I
want me own clothes. If you’ve done away
with ’em you’ll have to give compensation.
How’s a man goin’ to get a livin’ in toffy
fchiDvs like these?”

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALBURY, the City of Trees, green and
quiet by the Murray, is best at
dawn. One is fresh from rest, and
the break of gauge is very modest in . the
morning and says never a word. At night,
early birds feel that break of gauge as a per-
sonal affront, they wishing to be abed before
eleven; and if the-“ Limited” be full it is
twenty minutes or more past eleven before
one goes to bed in the second division. But
even in the hot nights of midsummer Albury,
in its green casement of gum, poplar, oak
and plane, seems cool enough for sleep, and
Kenilworth opposite, with its little wood and
meadow, is always peaceful.
It was a hot night —so hot that the red
of the danger-signals and tailrlights appeared
purple and Japanese. T had booked too late
for the Limited, and it was the second
division for me. Mrs. Brisk Umpire was
there, and it was the second division for her
too. She felt it keenly, and demanded that
a fifth sleeper should be kicked on to the
Limited, asking indignantly for “the mana-
gah of the railway company,” whereupon an
official had perforce to laugh. With her were
two companions, one a leggy, petulant Eng-
lishman who seemed to have learned deport-
ment at a dance of brolgas; the other a dog
or what had been once a dog. Now he was a
swollen, puffy animal, so fattily degenerated
by unearned A T ictuals that he could only
cough asthmatically when he intended to
hark.
Mrs. Brish Umpire turned on the more or
less human native companion and demanded
of him assistance. Her three chins insisted
on it; her haughty eyes said that if first aid
—and that adequate —was not immediately
rendered. Downing-street should be cabled at
once to send a warship to put these upstart
Australians in their places. The real and
all too delicate laces rose and fell on her
agitated and ample bosom like weed upon
the sudden tide in Flores Sea. Her balloon-
ing hips demanded help. Every atom of her
shrieked for first aid or a British gunboat.
The conductor stood at the car entrance,
submissive to the storm but quietly deter-
mined that Fido should not sleep to-night
not in a sleeping-car for human people, any-
how.
“Rew-pert,” said Mrs. Brish Umpire, Ay
tell you that Ay will not permit Blossom to
travel anywhair but in mai berth in the
vagon-lee!” .
“Mai dair,” said Rewpert, looking as if it
were unnatural for him to stand on more
than one leg at a time, and appearing more
like a brolga than before, “yew heard what
the —ah—man said !”
“He!” retorted Mrs. Brish Umpire. “Do
you think for one moment that Ai will
permit Blossom to tra-vel anywhair but in
mai berth in the vagon-lee?”
“In the dog-box, ma’am,” said the conduc-
tor.
“The dog-box! Blossom in the dog-box.
Ai tell you we are nevali — nevah separated!
Blossom is such a well-brought-up and edu-
cated doggie! He always sleeps in mai
rume!”
“He can’t to-night, ma’am. The rules are
fixed. Nobody can break through them.
And, if I could, the other passengers would
object.”
“Object to Blossom — mai Blossom?”
“They would, ma’am !”
“But he is quayet —so small —so gentle-
manly!”
“They’d object to him’ as much if he was
an illiterate elephant, ma’am. Y"ou can’t
get past it. There’s the regulation: ‘No
dog shall travel in a passenger .train except
in the box set apart for that purpose'.’ ”
“The awful dog-box!”
“The dog-b.ox. ma’am —but it isn’t awful.
The dog will he more comfortable there. If
he could travel in the sleeper somebody
might kick him.” ~ , . .
‘‘Kick Blossom! I would have him
arrested !”
“You couldn’t do anything to them,
ma’am, if he was in the wrong place. Pub-
lic opinion as well as the regulations would
be with the man who threw him out.”
“The wretches! But Ai tell you Blossom
must travel in inai sleepah ! Now, my deah
man, there’ll be only maiself and mai hus-
band in ouh section of the vagon-lee —mai-
self and mai husband and Blossom.”
“You're not in the same cabin as your
husband, ma’am. He’s upper A 2 in the
smoker, and you are in H with three other
ladies.”
“Separated from mai husband! How
dared they?”
“You booked too late for a two-berth sec-
tion, ma’am.”
“But whai didn’t the hotel people book
befoah?”
“I don’t know, ma’am. It’s a full train
and you’re booked for A upper 2 and II
upper 3.”
"Supposing you overlook that, may Ai
have Blossom in mai birth?”
“No, ma’am. I’ve nothing to do with it.
The Commissioners make the regulations.’
“Could these —ah —Commissioners sus-
pend the rules?”
“Yes, they could. I can’t.”
“Whair are they?”
“In Sydney.”
“Could you wiali them?”
“If I wired them, asking them to suspend
the regulations for—er —what’s his name —
Fido”
“Not Fido—Blossom !”
“Blossom then. Well, if I did. they’d wire
to suspend me from duty and have me ex-
amined by two doctors.”
“Shall Ai wiali them?”
“Yes, you can wire anyone from the tele-
graph office. But they’re all in bed now.”
"Then who is to give Blossom his beef-tea
in the morning?”
“You could have the dog-box opened at
Moss Vale, where we stop for breakfast.”
“But at what fame?”
“Somewhere between seven and eight.”
“Seven or eight? It won’t do! —it simply
won’t do! If Blossom doesn’t have his beef-
tea at six o’clock lie is faint. Ai carry a
spirit-lamp to heat it.”
“Even if he travelled with you, ma’am
(which he can’t), you wouldn't be allowed to
light a spirit-lamp in a berth section.”
“Well, it’s tyranny—sheer tyranny! Rew-
pert! You remember that person we met at
Biarritz —lady chairman of the W omen’s
Liberal League, or something of the sort—
she told us of the tyranny of these Labah
people. And it’s true —every word of it s
true! For you, mai man, Ido not wish to
be hard. This may not be your fault—but
you are in charge of the train.”
“Not while she’s on the station, ma am.
The station-master owns her till she gets the
right-away.” ‘
“Then Ai shall see him! Rew-pert: Tala
Blossom’s lead! Come to the station
mastah !”
“But you know.” protested Rewpert, it s
a rippin’ dog-box, A-y’m told. Top hole,
Ay’m told.”
“That is not adl! We are separated by the
regulations, too!”
“But Ai say. train’s full, you know.
Cawn’t be helped, you know, Flo! What’s
use makin’ bobber-ay?”
“ Rew-pert! Take me to the station-
mastah at once. No! Ai simply must!
Take Blossom’s lead! (Go with Papa, petite
c-herie!) Be careful of him, Rew-pert! You
know he isn’t strong, and this dreadful argu-
ment has agitated him.”
“Oh, well, I say, you know —it’s a top-hole
dog-box, y’ know !” But, as if he knew argu-
ment to be futile, he descended to the plat-
form hastily, and the bloated cur, feeling the
pull of the lead upon his swollen neck,
attempted to ju m P the eighteen inches from
the carriage to the platform, wheezed, fell
untidily on his side, and rolled to his gouty
feet shaking. The fat lady shrieked at Rew-
pert’s criminal carelessness and followed him
up the platform, still scolding.
I followed them to the S.M.’s office, which
faced the second-class section of the train.
They entered grandly and patronisingly as
if they were Emperor and Empress calling
on the poor to present a pair of last year’s
old boots. The door closed behind them, and
I had no ticket for the farce I knew was
being played within....
“Now! Let Dickie have a drink! A gio,
dear! — that’s - mumma’s boy! Drink.
Dickie !... .Yes, dear. You’re tired. I know,
but it will be cool directly, and we’ll all go
to sleep, and when morning comes we’ll all
be with Daddy.” I turned and saw, in a
hot. second-class compartment—made to look
hotter by the black American leather of the
upholstery—a young woman —dark, unruffled,
tender-eyed, handling hey charges placidly,
giving a little to that stubborn child and a
little to this; but always quietly, and ulti-
mately imposing her own will on them. She
was the mother of four and bound to sit un-
right for the whole of the hot night—to soothe
this one and pet that one to sleep, as well
as to suckle the dozing baby at her breast,
and keep intact that wondrous temper that
came of a good heart and a clean body and
a calm bra'n.
“Go to sleep, sweetheart, and Daddy will
come with the morning.”
The office door opened and a grimly-offi-
c:al stationmaster came from the argument,
weary but decisive. “In the dog-box.
Aladam —it’s the only way !”
And so the wretched and despicable Rew-
pert became the whipping boy as he led the
swollen, wheezy cur to his airy dungeon in
the baggage van. Rupert’s mamma and pro-
prietor scolded him viciously until he left
h n ’ - at the door of Section 11. Then he
returned aft and gloomily seated himself in
a deck chair near the lavatory, there to burn
a fat cigarette.
As the wheels began to turn, the obscene
Blossom was heard to yelp protestingly from
tlm doe-box astern, and the conductor grinned
unfeelingly. I grinned, too. because I hoped
the smothered and asthmatic yelp was Blos-
som’s worthless imitation of Gelert’s Dying
Yell. And then I thought of. the quiet Aus-

ZAM-BUK is Cooling, Soothing and Healing.
The maddening smart of a bum or scald (and the fact that the action
of the air is injurious) calls for the immediate application of Zam-Buk.
Keep a pot of this soothing first-aid in the most-get-at-able place The
kettle may boil over or lurch from the hob at any moment, and there is
daily risk of similar mishaps to men, women and children alike
Lighting one s pipe isn’t always safe and painless; lifting dishes from
the oven and washing up have their own warm surprises; and the von no
sters learn many painful lessons about playing with fire
“A burnt child dreads the fire”—but if mother
has applied Zam-Buk it loves this pure, healing
balm ever afterwards. Zam-Buk is soothing and
cooling, and besides subduing pain and inflamma-
tion it helps to grow new skin. Much tissue is
often destroyed, and those who have watched a
burn or scald heal up under Zam-Buk’s beneficent
influence have often marvelled at the wonderful
work resulting from the application of a balm
which works hand in hand with Nature so har-
moniously and effectively.
FOOT SCALDED WHILE COOKING.
Miss F. Douglas, of Sussex Street, Lower N. Adelaide, writes
“While engaged in the kitchen I had the misfortune to scald in
foot. I applied different ointments, but at the end of a mont!
my foot still remained bad. One day I bought a pot of Zam
Ruk, and after a few applications mv foot showed .
signs of healing, and in a little while it was
completely well. lam exceedingly grateful

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
m ARAKOI had nosed about the beauti-
ful estuary of the Swan until those
charming haunts had palled on her
and she grew restless for the open water.
She is scarcely a deep-sea cruiser. She was
built for smooth-water racing, after an
American design, by enthusiastic and loving
amateurs. She is 28 feet over all and her
spoon bow and great overhang aft make her
wet in a short sea. She is very flat on the
floor, but her wide beam and a ton and a
half of outside lead make her stable in a
breeze.
Outside tlie Mole there was now nothing
but a light head wind to test her quality.
She was unhappy. She climbed up and
down the big surges with dizzy indecision,
coming down on the shorter ones with a
shattering crash which threatened to disin-
tegrate her. Four hours of this uneasy
progression brought her only six miles to
Garden Island, where Governor Stirling, in
1829, made his first experiments in the
acclimatisation of imported seeds. That
first garden has gone under the sand, but
tlie island still earns its title every Spring
when the native wattle blazes out' in such
a flood of gold as almost overwhelms the
senses.
Under the lee of Garden Island we over-
took a boat which had started three hours
before us. This boat carried the stores,
mainly beer, on which Mandurah, the old
settlement 40 miles down the coast once
famous for its fisheries, depended for its
subsistence. Her owner was the complete
optimist. We had met him the day before
tod to a wharf in Fremantle waiting a.
favorable wind. lie carried four tons of
cargo in an open 22-footer, whose rotten sail
flapped like a broken wing, and whose
s'-ams gaped at the ocean. Thirty years ago
this same boat had been sailed around from
Melbourne. Summer and winter, rough or
smooth, her owner steered single-handed his
lonely course down the coast, his main obses-
sion to keep his cargo dry. He made light
o" our adventure. We would be all right
if we got through the Passage, and outside
we would be all right if the southerly didn’t
catch us. We would get into Mandurah
all right if there was enough water on the
bar, if the tide was with us and if the bar
wasn’t breaking all over. The last two
men who had had his job had been drowned,
one after 10 years, the other after two. He
had been at it 18 months.
A map of Westralia gives the impression
of a long barren coastline, unbroken by
harbors, rivers or islands, without shelter
for hundreds of miles. An Admiralty chart,
however, discloses a perfect welter of reefs,
rocks, spits and bays. From Fremantle to
Mandurah stretches a line of big and little
islands linked by breaking reefs inside
which, except for three stretches, is shel-
tered water. That water is covered with a
wilderness of flats and shoals, weed-banks
and reefs, amongst which a shallow-draught
boat may safely manoeuvre, but which must
have presented to the old sailing-ships a
horrifying problem. The bones of many
good vessels lie scattered here, from the
Vergulde Draeck, which sank with a rich
cargo in 1656, leaving 68 survivors to be
swallowed up forever by the great continent,
to the Orient liner Orizaba, whose salvaged
cargo made the fortunes of half the haber-
dashers in Perth. They turned the hose on
their old stock and sold it at enormous
profit.
The sou’-easter dropped, and with its cus-
tomary precision, suddenness and determina-
tion the sea breeze came in. This wind is
the historic Trade, which has borne on its
wings the business, adventure and rascality
of the world for centuries. Further north
it blows steadily day and night. Here it
comes in on top of the land breeze with
almost unfailing regularity every afternoon,
and the Jaded city-dweller, degrading its
high destiny to his suburban uses, calls it
“the Fremantle doctor.” For centuries it
filled the questing sails of Dutch voyagers,
who, unnoticed by history, have nosed along
this coast in great numbers. The record of
their discoveries was suppressed by a Gov-
ernment jealous of competition. It carried
Dampier along the N.W. coast and Vlam-
ing into the Swan. Doubtless it filled the
square, befigured sails of the Portuguese
Menezes who in 1527 first sighted the Abrol-
hos; and doubtless the same wind blew
Pelsart the Dutchman on to the same
islands a century later, thus wrecking a
Dutch scheme for colonising Australia.
Had ever barren islands uninhabited from
the dawn of time so brief and so dramatic
an appearance on the stage of history? On
June 4, 1629. Pelsart’s ship was wrecked
upon them. The next day their census rose
from nil to 180 persons. Pelsart started on a
fruitless journey along the coast of the main-
land in search of water, eventually reaching
Java. In the meantime, the supercargo, Jerom
Cornelis, filled with the lust of power,
planned a revolt, intending to massacre all
of the survivors who would not join with
him to seize whatever vessel came to succor
them. The ship’s company was distributed
amongst three islands. One morning the
vast empty sky witnessed the strange spec-
tacle of civil war. Cornelis and his fellow-
conspirators butchered 40 of their com-
panions on their own island. Then, turn-
ing to the next, they slaughtered its
entire population except five women and
seven children. Only the third island,
where were 45 unarmed men led by one
Weybhays, stood in the way of this new
world-conqueror. He organised a navy of
two shallops, and sent expedition after
expedition against them, but was beaten
off with staves studded with nails. Cornelis
in the meantime had consolidated his king-
dom. He had drawn up a Code yapoleon,
had taken to himself the style and title of
Captain-General, and had formed a com-
pany of guards, their uniforms of scarlet,
with a double lace of gold or silver. Be-
tween the laughing sea and the incredulous
sky the mad game went on, Cornells making
a treaty with his enemies and afterwards,
in the way approved in the best royal circles,
tearing it. up—until one day Captain Pel-
sart arrived in the Sardam frigate. Pel-
sart came immediately to an anchor and
was going ashore, when a boat from Wey-
bhays boarded him and apprised him of the
true state of affairs. When the navy of
Cornelis arrived at the ship’s side they
found the game was up and surrendered.
The Abrolhos Islands had seen murder and
rapine; now they were to see justice. A
gallows was erected and 40 mutineers wei'e
swung from it. In four months the lonely
rock had seen the whole gamut of human
passions run through, had seen 70 persons
drowned, 127 murdered and 40 hanged. Then
they returned for 200 years to their primeval
solitude.
* * * *
Within five minutes our full mainsail was
too much for us, and, wet from stem to
truck, we were thrashing for shelter to
Rockingham. The optimist had disappeared
in a mist of flying spray towards Careening
Bay.
Rockingham is a dead port galvanised into
temporary life by a military isolation-hospi-
tal. Enormous jetties, built of Westraljan
jar rah, push their iron-like frames, on which
the steel tram-rails are melting away, out
into the harbor. They testify to the old
importance of the timber-trade, when a dozen
sailing-ships at a time were anchored in the
bay. The waters have lost their foisson
too, and a hale old man who talks freshly of
1870 tells us how he and a mate drew 18.000
tail of snapper out of one school in the bay
and took the haul by sailing-ship up to
Batavia, where they sold it for £l2 a ton.
At midnight the familiar flapping of the
optimist’s after-leech awakened us: He had
come across when the wind dropped and had
kept his cargo dry. We were glad of his
company. At daybreak the whining of his
sheaves aroused us, and, backing our jib to
keep pace with him, we stood out for the pas-
sage around Cape Pcron. The passage is
narrow and beaconed by shoaling reefs on
which the full weight of the Indian Ocean
falls with magnificent sound and fury.
Out amongst the big seas Tarakoi shook the
bit out of her mouth. The optimist, one
hand on the tiller and the other on the pump,
sagged to leeward. We saw him once on top
of a swell waving a cheerful adieu ; then the
immense surges seemed to bury him, and b.v
the time we had made the passage into Warn-
bro* Sound, his sail showed very tiny six
miles down the wind. A barrel of beer, he
told us afterwards, had shifted on top of his
centrecase and jambed the board.
The ghosts of many ships visit Warnbro’
Sound. Once it possessed a wonderful har-
bor. It is described in a letter, recently
unearthed, written to the Secretary of the
Admiralty in 1845. The writer recommends
it as a site for a naval shipbuilding yard.
Jarrah and tuart instead of oak were to be t
used. The harbor is marked on the old
charts. It was “a most secure and beauti-
ful little harbor about a mile long, land-
locked and at all times as smooth as a mill-
pond. It has six, seven, and even nine fathoms
of water in it. Four American whalers have
been anchored there at the same time....
their bowsprits overhanging the strand.
About a mile across is a fresh lake very-
deep, which would furnish an inexhaustible
head of pure water.” “On this plain,” he
adds, “in my humble opinion, the capital of
Western Australia ought to have been
placed.” The harbor has completely dis-
appeared, and the lake is as salt as Lot’s
wife.
A freshening breeze blew off the land and
Tarakoi, her dinghy hoisted on to her
counter, began to cheer up. Footing the long
surges splendidly, she dashed forward in a
dazzle of foam, drenching her deck occasion-
ally with a sparkling comber and burying
her lee-rail well under. The coast slipped
by, looking as empty and barren as when
Vlaming sailed along it in search of the
survivors of the Riddegschap van Holland!
in 1696. The old Dutch voyagers, used to
the lush growth and teeming populations of
their tropical colonies, and lacking Cook’s
prophetic vision, were not attracted.
The bar at Mandurah. with four feet o
water on it, was breaking badly, as the
optimist had said it might be. Tarakoi
luffed for a moment, uncertain whether she
could do it; then, seeing a momentarily
clear patch, she went at it. A great swell
took charge and lifted her giddily; she
seemed to lose her feet in it; it rushed her
forward triumphantly, and then scornfully
abandoned her. She seemed to slide back-
wards towards a breaking sea that was com-
ing up behind. The next moment she was
gliding up the estuary in water as smooth as
a tabletop. A couple of hours later the opti-
mist blew in and started nonchalantly un-
loading his cargo alongside of us.
FENG-SHUI.
History.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE sits alone within her storied chair,
With heavy silken gown and broidered
sleeve;
The glory of the ages crowns her hair;
About her seat the winds of passion grieve,
The voice of poets weaving lyrics sweet;
Mem Ties, great clashing trumpets, surge at
flood.
While there _ she waits grave-eyed, meek-
lipped, discreet.
Her taper fingers foully dipped in blood.
She sends kings spinning with a careless
glance:
Forgotten heroes who have slumbered long—
She fires old names with splendors of
romance,
thril,R morning with a golden song
And yet, methinks, inscrutable and wise.
How oft she throws the dust into our eyes*
QUEENSLAND.

If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
their Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., more attention might
be paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can be effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must be of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall's Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 15% Asbestos—-the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only—and in
addition possess innumerable advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newall’s Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty, N.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the Ultimo, White Bay, Melbourne, Perth
and Canberra Power Stations.

'isfeß 2-Stand Shearing Plant
The Outfit that “Swept the Poll” in the 1917 Season.
F. D. McMASTER, Esq.., Dalkeith, Cassilis, writes, under date 24th January:
“i have pleasure in stating that I have given both of the 2 Stand Portable
Crutching Plants I purchased from you an exhaustive trial, and with the
utmost satisfaction. They are handy to move about, economical to run, and
the Fairbanks Morse Engine is simplicity itself. Crutching at the different
sheep-yards is, in my opinion, a far better method than doing the work at
the woolshed, as the saving for the lambing ewes in driving alone is very
considerable.”

"THE LEAKPROOF VALVE”
Has been adopted by the U.S. A. Government for three immense munition plants, costing 90,000,000 dollars
—6B 16in. valves and thousands of smaller sizes.
Australian chemical manufacturers are waking up. We are now making seven special alloy valves
to control nitric acid for a large chemical and explosive works in Melbourne.
Marine engineers are realising what an immense relief “Everlasting’’ Valves offer, and are now installing
them as a stop=valve beyond the feed checks. They want a valve that actually will
shut off every particle of steam.
