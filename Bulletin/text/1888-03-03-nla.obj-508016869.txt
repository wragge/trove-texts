SATURDAY, MARCH 3, 1888,
The Chinese Freetrader.
The ever-rising tide of Chinese immigration has
at last brought the New South Wales Foreign-
trade party face to face with a problem which
promises favourably to undermine all their
cherished doctrines and to leave them adrift and
helpless on a trackless sea of theory. For nearly
30 years the Mongolian Question has been waiting
a solution, but the statesman who was prepared
to do more than tinker feebly with it has been
conspicuously wanting. The Chinese curse has
served so long as a rallying cry for politicians that
many would regret to part with the old, time-
worn war-whoop, and would find it a matter of no
email difficulty to supply its place. The moth-
eaten watchword, “ The Chinese must go,” has
done much good work at a multitude of elections,
but the men who depend most upon it are suffi-
ciently aware that when the Chinese have gone,
it will be impossible to find another political shib-
boleth which will go so far to supply the place of
brains, education, and common honesty, and so
the Asiatic still remains and is still preached
against and anathematised as of old. He
has been the mainstay o’ all sorts and con-
ditions of demagogues, and the increase in
his numbers holds forth good promise that
he will fulfil the same mission for their sons and
grandsons for many years to come. The old
Chinese anathema is now undergoing the process
of being hashed up afresh, and Parkhs, who has
found bread and cheese in so many other public
grievances, has, in his desperation, taken up the
subiect of the obtrusive leper, but the result bids
fair to be the same as in many previous agitations.
If the Chinese curse proves a convenient political
weapon then the -Chinaman will remain till
Parkes is done with him; if, on the other hand, it
falls flat on the public ear, then it will drop with
a dull thud into the grave of oblivion to await the
next convenient resurrection. In either case the
Mongol is tolerably safe so long as the Frestrade
party remains in power. He cannot be expelled
without the utter annihilation of that cherished
creed, for the leper is part of the great doctrine
which Pabkes cadged, without understanding it,
from Cobdbn ; and the fan-tan house and the
opium- den are built on the everlasting rock of
commercial freedom. Sir Henry himself, unless
all his latter-day theories are a hollow lie, holds a
brief for each Ah Sin who sleeps in a gin-case in
Lower George-street, Sydney, or Little Bourke-
street, Melbourne, Mr. Wise, as his devoted ad-
herent, is buttoner for the tribe of pak a-pu
sharps ; and the whole party must either stand by
the Chinaman or fall with him and be over-
whelmed in the ruins of the shanty which Bung
Hi has built in the land of his exile.
* * *
The reason for this is sufficiently plain. The
Chinaman is the living embodiment of the Free-
trade theory, the unconscious, unassuming, yet
eloquent, symbol of a great political doctrine 1
Stolid and ignorant as he may be, the dull-minded
heathen who plods around with the “spling callot”
and the * ‘ lettucee ” is the outward and visible sign of
the boasted commercial freedom on which the
present New South Wales Ministry has traded so
long and so successfully. The ports of Australia,
according to Pabkes, should be open to the com-
petition of all the world, and the Chinaman conies
to Australia and competes accordingly. Cheap
goods, in the words of the same apostle, are the
great want of this "Continent, and ao long as the
manufactured products of Britain and Germany
are lower in price than those of Australia they
must be admitted on the great commercial prin-
ciple which bids us buy in the cheapest market;
and the Mongolian slave learns this lesson, and by
dint of living upon rice in a dog-kennel he under-
sells alike the Briton and the German, and is con-
sequently more to be esteemed than either. Pro-
tection, in the gospel according to Parkes, is a
barbarous and futile attempt to keep up wages to
an unnatural figure instead of permitting them to
find their own natural level, and. the respon-
sive Mongol fixes the level at half-a-crown
per diem, and the white man who declines to ac-
cept this amount must starve so long as an Asiatic
can be found to fill his place in the great market
of labour. The ideal State, as Parkes declared a
hundred times during the last general election,
is that in which the Customs-house is utterly
abolished and Customs duties are unknown, and
the Chinese poll-tax is a Customs duty—a tariff
on leprosy, vice, and human degradation—and,
therefore, ranks among the imposts which must
be swept away before New South Wales can enter
upon the Golden Aga of industry in which every-
one is to be unemployed. Everywhere the China-
man is interwoven with the policy of Freetrade,
and when he lays a sacrilegious hand on the fel-
low exile Park Ks is sawing through the pillars of
the tabernacle, and dragging it dowil upon his
own insolvent head.
♦ •
But the Chinaman in Australia is, after all,
only a secondary item in the Freetrade pro-
gramme. The Cheap and nasty Mongol has, it is
true, done much for the cause by reducing the
price of labour, but still he is only beginning to
mate himself felt. Under the present regime, no
white man can obtain work so long as a China-
man is unemployed, and as the Chinese increase
and multiply, the time comes nearer when no
white man will obtain work at all unless he
chooses to accept the ra"e of wages for which his
yellow competitor is prepared to labour, but even
this outlook is nothing compared to what lies
beyond. The cheap Mongol who harasses the
workmen of New South Wales will shortly be
succeeded by a cheaper Mongol still; the ex-
patriated Chinaman who is willing to toil for 15s.
per week will be succeeded by the Chinaman at
home, who gladly accepts one-third of that
amount, and the competition of the thousands of
Asiatics who infest Australia will be lost amid
the competition of millions who swarm in the
Central Flowery Land. China is fast becoming a
great manufacturing country, Englishmen, guided
by the Frestrade axiom which bids them buy
everything—labour include!—in the cheapest
market, are establishing factories and teaching
the yellow artizans the secrets of their trades.
Australia itself is, more or less, educating
thousands of leprous aliens every year in
her arts and industries, and in a few years,
if Freetrade lasts so long, the ports of New
South Wales will be choked with products
of all descriptions, landed at half the cost of
similar goods produced by Chinese labour in
Australia. Free competition, according to Parkks
and his supporters, should be the sole factor
in fixing the rate of wages, and when
New South Wales begins to fejl the full
pressure of the competition of 300,000,000
souls all ready and willing to labour for
a few pence daily then the white man's wages
must descend to the same figure or Protection
must come. Chinese Imports are a danger ten-
fold greater than Chinese immigration in its worst
form, and so long as Asiatic goods find free access
to the ports of New t outh Males, Parks s’ dia-
tribes against the presence of the aliens are a hol-
low mockery, as devoid of all substance as the
famous Kiama Ghost.
* * *
Even in the midst of his anathema at Camper-
down, Sir Henry paused to admit that the alter-
native lay between Protection and a Chinese in-
vasion, aad deliberately and coldly the hollow-
hearted renegade declared his choice, “ I would
rather have a Chinaman than a rabid Protec-
tionist any day,” he declared, and if the daily
papers are to be believed the miserable audience
of Freetraders answered with “ cheers.” And
for once, and only once, there is no doubt that
Parkes spoke the truth. The Chinaman ram-
pant is the banner of the party wh'ch insolently
declares itself to be that of “ commercial free-
dom,” and the leader of that party, in the fulness
of the bigotjd ferocity, selfishness, and tyranny
which have marked every stage of his career,
openly announces that rather than the Calico
Jemmies who have politically bought him
should lose one cent of their profits, he is
prepared to see Australia overrun by the leprous
brotherhood of Ah Sin and Chow Lee. And,
indeed, Sir Henry’s choice could n:t well be
otherwise. The latter-day prophe : of Freetrade
cannot grant Protection against Chinese labour
and Chinese goods without to utterly sacrificing
that gilded fiction which he terms his “ prin-
ciples ” that no Calico Jemmy would ever vote for
him again. Freetrade, as he has declared a hun-
dred times, means free competition and the free
interchange of commodities; and the Chinaman
is the apotheosis of free competition, and the
living embodiment of the principle which keeps
Parkks out of the Benevolent Asylum. If the
Mongol trader cannot come to New South Wales
fr.e, and trade freely within its borders, then
what, in the name of Eternal Truth, is the mean-
ing of Freetrade ?
* • *
Again Sir Henry speaks :
I have always done my utmost to keep this f fir country for
the people who come from the three kingdoms, and 1, more
than any other man, have resisted the influx of ths Chinese
into ths country. Not that 1 join' in the senseless cry
against these people as being so very inferior to us. On the
contrary, I oppose them on account of their individual vir-
tues. They are a law-abiding, industrious, prudent,
plodding, careful people, and it is because they have these
qualities that I fear their introduction here, seeing that
behind them there are 400.000,000 of them
In the face of these words, we ask again : ‘‘ What
is Freeirade ?” According to Parkes’ own show-
ing, he objects to the Mongol—not on account of
his immorality and his filth, not on account of the
infection whifii clothes him like a garment of
curses, or the opium which he introduces to steal
away the white man’s brains, or the brothels into
which he lures children to their ruin, or the fan-
tan and pak-a pu dens where he defrauds and
plunders his victims; but the representative
Freetrader demands his expulsion in half-hearted
phrase because of the abilities which make
his competition felt in a land that takes free
competition for its wa'chword- -because he is
eminently qualified to be a trader In the country
which elected Parkes that he might make trade
free to all the world, Chinamen and every other
cheap-labour alien race included. Yet, if Free-
trade New South Wales is to be protected against
the Chinaman simply because he is a dangerous
rival, then it must likewise be protected against
the German and the Belgian who possess all the
virtues on account of which Parkes would drive
the yellow man into the eea and shut out the
100,000,000 competitors of the Central Flowery
Land ; and the Englishman and the Scotchman,
the American, the Frenchman, and the Italian,
must all go for the same reason. The Apostle of
Freetrade and of unlimited rivalry in the fields of
industry proposes at one fell swoop to shut out
the trade aad the industries of one-third of the
entire human race, and when he advocates such
wholesale Protection as this there is no reason
why he should not strain his elastic principles a
little further and shut out the remaining two-
thirds of the world’s inhabitants as well,
* * *
But Parkks’ reasons grow even weaker as he
proceeds;
I want to keep Australia for Englishmen and Scotchmen
ana Irishmen. I want the people to be so thoroughly on an
equality that they may all stand shoulder to shoulder as
Australian citizens; and one reason why 1 am opposed to
the introduction of the Chinese or any inferior race is that I
only want people here who can stand on one common ground
of equality. (Cheers.) When I see a man advocating the
introduction of the Chinese I am always inclined to ask him
if he would like to have a Caiuaman to marry his daughter
(Hear, hear, and laughter.) I want no man hare who cannot
enjoy our righti or intermarry with the rest of tha population.
Surely such Protection as this no man ever heard
of before. The Frenchman, the German, and the
American, Aocbrdirg to PArkes, are "not good
enough to tread Australian soil and to compete
with the Australian ia his own land, yet the prin-
cip’e to which the ancient political sham owes his
oleva*ion and almost his existence declares that
these same outcasts may compete with the Aus-
tralian to any extent in their own factories and
workshops. They may take the bread out of the
mouth of the colonial workman, hut they must
not come between the wind and bis nobility ;
their goods are welcomed, but their presence is
declared to be intolerable ; the articles which they
make are sold in the colonial markets, but the
men who make them are so much lower and
meaner than their productions that they are
warned off th?s9 shore?. They are to bo treated
as being on a level with the Chinaman who may
not marry our sisters and our daughters—and
here we pau-e to ask why in the name of
Freetrada the Mongol may not marry Parkes'
aunt should he and she feel so inclined ? The
vary essence of Freetrade is free competition ia
the marts of industry, and how can tile competi-
tion, which is so commendable in the factory and
the workshop, become a thing to be avoided with
loathing at the altar ? Frary theory and axiom of
Freetrade declares that all the world -Chinamen
Included--may struggle With the white Australian
for the wages on which his wife’s support depends,
and why, then, should all the world not compete
fairlyand hoaestlyfor the possession of ihe lady her-
self ? Let the Chinaman marry Parkes' maiden au at
if he and she are so inclined. Freetrade demands
that he should be at liberty to do so, and for vary
shame the Bmmmagen renegade da-e not turn
traitor so soon to his new faith.
* » ♦
I', is impossible for Parkes to head an anti-
Calnese crusade. His faith forbids him, even as
the hereditary creed of the pawnshop forbids the
Threebill Abigail to touch pork. The Freetrader
cannot afford to establish Protection against the
Chinaman and his indust ies ; the old Mongol
curse has been merely resurrected as a possible
weapon in a future election ; “ tha Chinese
must go” is the war-whoop of the future,
but the Chinese will not go so long as Parkes
can gain a single vote on this mrth-eaten
battle-cry, for the sufficient reason that when
they are gone the cry will have had its day
and its service will be ended. The New fc-'ou h
Wales Freetrade Orangemen and the Mongol are
brothers by nature, and a yellow feeling makes
them wondrous kind. The yellow flag is a power
in the land, and under its shelter the Asiatic has
come to stay. His house is built upon the rock of
Freetrade, and until Protection becomes the creed
of New South Wales his position is, at least,
theoretically, invulnerable. He is ths emblem of
a boasted creed ; the outward symbol of the most
widely-advertised of modern shams ; the visible
image of a huge political lie ; and the divinity
which hedges him in is greater than that which
environs a king. Knowing this, the Mongol is
content. -He has come to grow up with the coun-
try, and New South Wales must get rid of An
Sin and Ah Parkes together if the incubus is
ever to be really shaken off.
Speculative Profits.
Closely akin to the land question is that of
profit—we mean as regards a certain class of mer-
cantile and trafficking operations. The bull and
bear of the share markets are justly criticised as
suspicious characters, but the bulls and bears of
commerce are too commonly surrounded with a
halo of sanctity. These individuals do,not repre-
sent the genuine trading which consists in the dis-
tribution of the world’s supplies, and the profits
arising from which, like those of any less dis-
guised storage and transport, or of production, are
in kind, if not always in amount, fair and equitable.
They, on the other hand, rather obstruct than
facilitate the response to the world's requirements,
by speculating, like the land-kings, in scarcity
values, and from their position, which gives them
power to work their will unrestrained except by
the conflicting interests of others of the same
genus, or by the depletion of the public upon
which they prey, they may well be said to gamble
at the general expense, with a suit of trumps con-
cealed in each sleeve.
-* # •
It has well been pointed out that periods of
great bankruptcies, though disastrous to indi-
viduals concerned in them, go hand-in-hand
with renewals of social freedom and prosperity,
simply because the public, being exhausted of
their funds, cannot pay the monopolists, who, in
turn, cannot pay their fellow-monopolists, and
thus the depleting process is temporarily stayed,
the money is indirectly returned to the people by
insolvent prices and other powerful influences,
and, in short, the machine has been screwed up as
high as it will go, and has dropped down ready
for the screwing-up process to be commenced
over again. This fact alone should indicate one
of the fundamental errors of our social system.
* * *
As an illustration of the moral character of thin
kind of dealing, we will suppose the object of
traffic to be a loaf of bread. The profit made by
the individual baker ia fair in kind, as being in
the nature of wages for his labour. So is that of
the master baker, although the division of that
profit afterwards into his share and that of his
employes may be open to question. So is that of
the storekeeper who procures bread and sells it to
his customers in the ordinary course of things.
But all these are profits (or indeterminate wages)
upon labour or care in some form for the benefit
of those who wish to consume bread. The profits
of which we speak in connection with the mercan-
tile world are, however, profits upon mere trans-
actions, or as between the immediate parties, a
price paid for the “right” of monopoly trans-
ferred, and as between them and the general
public, a price paid by the latter (ultimately) for
what the* ought to be paid instead of paying for
—the control by someone else of goods in course
of distribution, with a view to the party so
favoured making the public, who pay for their
privilege, pay also more for the goods, because
by reason of the privilege they are difficult to be
had. These profits on mere transactions may be
likened with perfect justness to keeping a six-
penny loaf from a hungry man until he will give a
shilling for it, or, at best, taking ad vantage, of
his hunger to obtain a shilling. 1
If the world’s wheat supply is defle’ent, the loss
in wheat falls upon the world. The mere difficulty
of procuring it causes it to be used lees freely.
The producer sustains a money loss by the non-
return of what he has invested. It is precious
little scarcity value that comes to Mm, although
he is the most justly entitled to it on the mere
principle of making the product cover the cost.
But in the processes of distribution and the ex.
change of wheat for money, the wheat gets into
the hands of certain middlemen. What the pub-
lic lose in wheat is increased by the raising of
prices for monopoly value, so that they have to
use still less owing to the dearness and pay more
for that. In short, the logs which normally falls
Upon the world increased to the masses to give
a gain to the middlemen. The position is then this
—that, considering the wheat and money as inter-
changeable equivalents, these middlemen, when
harvests are small, get more wheat, counted in
money, than they would have if it were plenti-
ful ! The smaller the general loaf is the bigger
the slice they can cut off as their share !
• * *
The sum and substance of this “ great trading,
this “ mercantile occupation of the higher sort, ’
this anything but what trading normally is' and
ought to be, and yet regarded with more respect
than it, what is it hut “I came in the way of
JoitES buying from Brown for a thousand pounds,
paid Brown his thousand or less for what I did
not want for the supply of my customers, if I have
any, and made Jones give me five hundred extra
before I would let him have it. Jones will
have to get the five hundred out of the public,
and so I am being supported by the public for in-
(erfering with their getting their wants sup-
plied.” The amount of brain-power and other
work expended upon getting money by extortion,
nstead of getting it by applying the same labour
to some useful end for which the money could be
had in fair exchange, is simply appalling. Lost—
and worse than lost, destructive —to what an ex-
tent might it not advance the social world if but
applied to increasing the average store, instead of
lowering it by these private levies !
* * *
Fortunately the increased facilities for distribu-
tion wi!l gradually throw up obstacles to such a
system. The duty of everyone with the true
principles of social right at heart is in the mean-
while to discountenance, by ever y means in his
power, traffic of this class, and for himself to re-
gard it with tha abhorrence due to its actual
character, so that he will endeavour to make his
living by production or—ia the true sense of the
woids—legitimate trading, and no more con-
descend to the wiles of the Merchant Kings than
he would to the tricks of “bookmaking,” or the
profitable impostures of sham doctors and patent-
medicine quacks. The matter is one with which
the-State is almost powerless to deal, and the
education of the moral perceptions and inclina-
tions must be the ultimate remedy for the evil, I
Protection and Laud Nationalisation.
TiiE Litiigow (N S.W.) Enterprise writes with-
sorrowful anger concerning the Bulletin’s views
on the dual subj act which forms the caption of
this article. Oar youthful ally in tha crusade
against landlordism has, for one day only, left off
smashing “the robber who takes all that is lefc,"
in order to do a M a - nre3o >- M‘L l i k ()ne tilt with
our noble selves. It is a regretful thing that such
a temporary estrangement should have occurred.
Had it nob been for Bulletin advocacy of
Georgian principles in the past, the cause would
not to-day have had an organ so able as the Lira-
sow Enterprise, and the big chance is that it
would not have had any organ at all. And at
present the Sydney Herald and Telegraph are
not more in harmony in supporting land monopoly
than are the Enterprise and Bulletin in de-
nouncing it. The Li hgow paper possesses the
heart—the “heart alone which bsats responsive
to onr own”—and therefore ths present attack is
the more to be deplored and lamented. It
angers our ally that we should have si ated
the accomplishment of land nationalisation to bo
yet afar off. And, in denial of the assertion,
are reprovingly told, as a proof of the proximity
of such accomplishment, “ that no reform has
ever stirred up se much interested opposition,"
Precisely. And ‘it is the very fierceness and
strength of this “interested opposition” that we
fear as a barrier capable of resisting for a long
time the efforts of the reformers whose aim it is
to "burst land monopoly into more pieces than
there are threepennies in a Cathedral collection-
plate. Moreover, the Enterprise scoffs at our
query as to tha fate of the working classes while
the struggle against monopoly is proceeding.
“ This implies,” we real, “that the world will
stand still until the issue is decided.” Not at all;
that is not any stiller than at present. But, view-
ing the forlorn condition of the masses now ex-
posed to the crushing inllnonce of foreign compe-
tition, The Bulletin holds that, even supposing
Land Nationalisation to be capable of consumma-
tion by, say, 1898, it would yet be necessary to do
something to alleviate the misery of the masses in
the interim. Further, we are told that land-
owners, terrified by the spread of the Georgian
faith, will bo compelled, “ for their own advan-
tage, to put their land to use.” We don’t
seem to fully grasp the purpose of this statement.
If it means that landownoiT"would accept a less
rent for their land than cultivators would will-
ingly give, we have no hesitation in saying that
local landlords “ain’t built that way.” But, sup-
pose they did, the result would be to draw good
red gold from the proprietor’s coffers and put it
into the pocket of the tenant. This would be a
gratifying and beneficial reform in the matter of
wealth-distribution, but no greater sum total of
national wealth would be created. Wages would
receive more, rent would receive less; or rather


tho rent would be divided between landlord and
tenant. This has been done to a large extent in
Ireland, but we have never heard anyone contend
that the equitable measure in force there has been
directly productive of an accession to the stock of
the community’s wealth, except by reason of the
fact that the revenue whi:h used to be spent in
Belgravia is now appropriated and retained in
t he land wherein it is produced. About two
columns further along in his article, our lovingly-
reproachf ul mentor takes eloquent exception to The
Bulletin’s assertion that were Australians to work
for 12 hours per day in place of eight, and for the
present day’s wage, the immediate necessity for
protection would disappear. “ The increase in
the hours of labour,” he says, “would simply
signify an addition to the numbers of the unem-
ployed.” On this point we are distinctly at issue,
for it seems certain beyond dispute, that if labour
in this country were £0 per cent, cheaper articles
could be produced at a very much cheaper rate ;
foreign competitors would lose a portion of the
overwhelming advantage now enjoyed, and the
number of new industries thus called into exis-
tence would cause a huge local demand for labour.
Although every worker would do nearly 60per cent,
more per diem the increased demand for labour
would far more than counterbalance the increased
supply of work added to each man’s day. In
numerous classes of articles the difference bo-
tween the cost of production in (say) England and
Australia is not more than 10 por cent., and if
labour were 50 per cont. cheaper it would be im-
possible to import such commodities as
cheaply as they could be locally produced.
Such an addition to Labour’s burden would
be equivalent to a dime were our community
to permit it, but that it would for a time banish
unemployment is demonstrably certain. Another
matter in which it is our sorrow to differ from the
Enterprise is as to the advisableness of dropping
Protection in order to devote all our energies to
the work of dynamiting land monopoly. This is
not solely a matter of strategy. Consideration for
the pressing necessities of the now-distressed
masses must be a primary work. They must be
protected as against Bung Hi and Co., else their
means of existence will become more obscure
than at present even. And strategy also demands
that Protection should be enacted with the least
possible delay. For Land Nationalisation will find
its chiefest champions in the masses, and if they
are reduced to wretched dependence who shall
take their share of the coming attack on the
monopoly-privlPgoi classes? And, besides, the
community now has become educated up to Pro-
tection, while the Evangel ff land reform is but
slowly carrying its influence through the country.
The “ interested opposition ” has not as yet ar-
rayed itself to do battle with principles which it
does not so far find it worth while to formally re-
cognise. And it is only by successive stages that
Land Nationalisation can be won. At first none but
the larger proprietors will oppose the movement,
but as it advances land-owners of leaser importance
will also array themselves against it, until at the
last every owner of a 20 by 40 allotment will bring
his Partingtonian broom to stem the tide cf
Georgian principle. Land Nationalisation shall
be made possible by aid of the power accruing to
independent wisely-protected workers; without
hat aid its progress must bo slow, uncertain, and
ndeflnite,
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Ration of Shopkeepers.
Napoleon I. spoke with the voice of prophecy
when he denounced his British enemies as a nation
of shopkeepers, and in the shopkeeping instincts
of the Englishman lie the ultimate ruin of his race.
The day has long since come in Britain when
wealth accumulates and men decay, and un-
happily the check which the accumulation of
wealth has received, of late years has done nothing
to retard the dry rot which is eating away the life
of the once sturdy Anglo-Saxon people.. Three-
quarters of a century of prosperity has almost
utterly wiped out the hardiest portion of the
nation, and the past few years of disaster and
poverty have only accelerated the process of
extinction. Since the days of the Napoleonic
wars the peasantry of the three kingdoms the
section which supplied the vast armies that did
and suffered so much in the great Peninsular
struggle—have been replaced by a horde of knock-
kneed, attenuated men, who deteriorate in the
atmosphere of overgrown cities, and the agricul-
tural districts are fast degenerating into a tangled
wilderness. The Highlands of Scotland- erstwhile
the home of the bravest and hardiest men who
ever breathed —have poured their population into
the cities of the Lowlands, and from them the
Celts have drifted away to foreign lands.
They have been driven by thousands from
their homes, and their farms have been
turned into grouse moors, on which the
vulgar Smiths and Robinsons of the Stock
Exchange, the pot-bellied money-getters whose
patriotism is measured by commission and the
state of the financial market, roam about in ridi-
’ culous garments and make uncouth efforts to
shoot birds ; and the able-bodied inhabitants of
these once-teeming lands now number little
more than the soldiers whom they sent to
Waterloo. The Highland regiments of the pre-
sent day-are filled with weedy youths picked up in
the slums of Glasgow, and the men, who were once
the main defence of their country, are gone for
ever. The warlike peasants of Ireland have been
weeded out till the entire population of the island
is little more than half its former number, and
still the Government watches the process of
national decay unmoved, and advises the scanty
remnant of the nation’s life-blood to migrate, and
j leave Britain to her fate. When the Crofters of
Lewis appealed recently to the “ blue-bloc ded ”
female who professes to own their native
island, and asked for some concession to enable
them to live in the land of their valiant fathers,
she replied that they should go abroad and abandon
their empty country to the kites and crows, and
when the Tory Government was invited to inter-
pose it replied through the mouth of Butcher
Balfouh, the Chief Secretary for Ireland,
that the only remedy for the evils under
which the impoverished Celts laboured was
emigration, and that they should use their strong
arms to enrich and defend some foreign land. In
this peculiar madness Britain stands solitary
among the nations of the earth. She alone en-
deavours to get rid of her defenders, and seeks,
by sending away her hardy peasantry, to turn
herself into a nation of clerks and shopkeepers
and bowed-down, spirit-broken factory operatives.
Not only in the mother country does wealth accu-
mulate while men decay, but the process of decay
is urged on by the Legislature of the nation, and
the producers are driven out to make room for the
non-producers—the agriculturists are expelled by
the greasy traders, and the mongrel race of stock-
brokers and jobbers. London, where the impove-
rished blood of the citizens was formerly recruited
from the cart-horse and the plough, is now overrun
by thieving Greeks from the Levant, and by German
and Hebrew adventurers, and a nondescript race
is arising to succeed the men of the mountains
who once fought Britain’s battles so success-
fully against the world. The mother country
offers a premium for national decay, and sedul-
ously cultivates the dry-rot of greed which makes
money take the place of men and which crowds
the sinewy peasant out of the land to make room
for the stunted cotton-spinner and his lazy master,
and as she sows the wind so she will reap the
whirlwind. The gradual extinction of the pro-
ducing classes of Britain must inevitably end in
the bottomless pit of national ruin. There is not
room in this world of stnfe and aggression for a
nation of shopkeepers.

i Hand red v. Three Millions.
Life, an English Tory organ, run by a grovelli -:g
German, and not unfrequently quoted by the
Argcs correspondent, thinks that “ skilly and a
plank bed, relieved by oakum-picking, are excel-
lent things for curing Socialistic tendencies," and
wants to have them prescribed more freely for
that complaint. It doesn’t seem to think, how-
ever, that the same thing would suit a bloated
Tory who enjoys annually an income equal to the
wages of 8000 workmen each with a wife and a
family of, say, three children—in other words,
who absorbs the means of keeping 40,000 people
from starvation, and does so simply because a
villainous old thief somewhere far back stole the
inheritance of the nation and kept it. There are
plenty of such aristocrats in England, but skilly
and oakum-picking are not in their line. The
Duke of Westminster, for instance, enjoys are-
venue of some £400,000 a year, mostly unearned
increment, for which he neither toils nor spins
This amount, derived chiefly from ground-rents in
London, is constantly increasing. In sharp con-
trast to him is the labourer whoso wage 3 in times
of prosperity seldom exceed 20s. weekly, and who
now earns perhaps a fourth of that sum, who
would think himself rich if his paltry £52 per
annum could only be made secure against the
fluctuations of the labour-market, and who, when
Fortune smiles on him, contrives somehow to keep
a family—which, by the irony of fate, is generally
a large one —on his pittance in tolerable content-
ment. The incomes of a hundred of the wealthiest
landowners—or land-thieves—in England would
almost extinguish the present sufferings oE this
class, and would restore to nearly every one of
the swarming, starving unemployed his full rate
of wages; the confiscation of a hundred great
estates, stolen centuries ago byfoice and fraud,
would wipe out hunger and famine, and stay the
anguish of a whole nation; the abolition of a
hundred titled drones would raise some
three million men, women, and children
from the depths of abject misery to
what they would regard as comfort and
happiness, but the prescription instead is skilly
and a plank bed and oakum-picking, and as the
nation endures all this, what wonder that curses
should be heaped in millions on the heads of those
whose rapacity has doomed a whole people to
such untold sorrow 1 Life is a worthy supporter
of this worthy class ; it is the organ of bigotry
and Tory greed, run by a Dutch German, the
descendant of a bottle-gatherer; and ol this
ignoble defender of an ignoble faction it can only
he said that the cause and the advocate are de-
serving of each other.

The Newtown Election.
The election which took place last Saturday, at
Newtown, according to the showing of the
Foreign-Traders themselves, furnishes a melan-
choly pro if of the deo’ine of the shoddy cause in
New South Wales. Some three weeks ago the
electorate was polled on the question of Protection
for local industries v. Protection for the English-
man, the German, and the Mongol, alias Free-
trade, and the former cause scored 1809 votes
against some 1200 a year previously, thereby
showing that 12 months of Freetrade had driven
600 electors into the opposite camp. The victory
of the Foreign-trade faction was almost as dismal
as a defeat, so tremendous was the falling eff in
their roll-call, but the importers and their satel-
lites consoled themselves by the oft-ropeited
fiction that the Protectionists had voted to the
last man, while only a handful of the Foreign
trade party had gone to the poll. “It was known
that every Protectionist vote in the electorate
would be recorded at least once, and a glance at
the number got together proves that this was
done," said Sydney D.T. oa the morning after the
battle, and the other organs of Chinese industry
followed in the same groove, and sounded the tom-
tom of joy over their success. But last Saturday
the Freetraders put forth all their strength to crush
for ever the hydra-headed monster of Protection,
and, instead of rolling up in thousands to whoop for
leprosy and shoddy, they showed a total of only
174 votes more than at the previous contest,
while the Protect! mists, who, according to the
Freetrade organs, had polled every available man
three weeks before, scored an advance of 108 on
their former figures Either, therefore, the oft-
repeated assertion of the Dead-House party was
an unblushing falsehood, or else the national
cause has gained in this one electorate an acces-
sion of 108 converts in the space of 23 days. In
the latter it might be worth while for Parkes
to figure oub in pencil on the back of one of Mac-
NAMARA’s letters about the lease which he paid
Sir Henry for, and which ho is unable to get, how
long it will take for Protection to score a solid
majority throughout New South Wales, and
Francis Abigail might kindly check the calcula-
tion on the fly-leaf of that unpublished report
about the morals of his mysterious “bank.” The
only substantial consolation now left to the New-
town Freetrader lies in the repetition of the old
garish libel that the Protectionist muster was
enhanced by double-voting and personation, and
that the dead were resurrected to vote for Smith.
But, somehow, people have ceased to put much
faith in this hoary departure from the truth. The
same moth-eaten tale did some good ser-
vice at the recent contest at Paddington, but
when put to the test the frauds proved to
be sole'y on the side of the Fxeetrade party, and
the Protectionist majority was increased to nearly
three times its former dimensions. The reward
of £5 which Abigail offered, at Newtown, for the
arrest of one of his enemies in the act of persona-
tion still remains unclaimed, and when an indig-
nant e’ector openly accused a member of Mr.
A bbott's committee of having rolled up 80 sham
votes, at a cost of 10s. a-piece, it was thought
best to let the accusation pass in silence. Even
the Escaped Haynes did not think it safe to de-
mand an enquiry end a great, overgrown libel
action, though he wrote to the D.T., with his cus-
tomary vim, to state that
Tfce men who ere urging this country to Protection are
mostly strangers— half of them are Victorians, and not a
handful of A ustralians are to be found among them. Few of
hem have ever set foot outside Sydney.
Parkbs himself confined his efforts on behalf cf
his faithful follower to gin era! abuse and the
declaration that he never could understand Pro-
tection. Figures, however, show that there are
in Newtown 700 more men who can understand
the creed which Sir Henry himself used to follow
without comprehending it than there were 12
months ego, and it remains to be seen whether
these 700 are all wrong, and the dotard who is
paid for being too dense to know anything about
their arguments alone is right.
. s.
flic local Option Fizzle.
In common charity members of the community
should bestow whatever compassion they may be
able to produce upon the Local Optionists of New
S.uth Wales. These energetic and verbose en-
thusiasts have made so much noise recently as
to deceive themselves into the lelief that they
are a numerically important section cf the people.
They persuaded Mr. E. J. H. Knapp, that widely
self-advertised phi’anthropist, to this same belief,
and (he result was that he went within an ace of
subscribing £lO to the national shortage. As it
is, he has since bis magnificent defeat had some
occupation for his spare moments, trying to per-
suade some of his delufiers into paying up the
shortage of £2OO or so which his electioneering
expenses left as a memorial of his adventurousness
in coming forward. He seems to have thought that
the Local Option vote was strong enough to make
him M.P., but voters generally used whatever
Local Option they had on hand to keep him steady
on an emphatically back seat. And now that the
Local Option vote has been taken on the question
of public-houses, it has been manifested that the
number of adherents of the principle who thins
their faith wor h the small trouble of voting for,
is absurdly unimportant. The enormous deputa-
tions which assemble occasionally to worry
Ministers of the Crown with dog-eared arguments
and second-hand statistics of the miocene period,
must comprise most of the rank-and-file, as well
as all the leaders of the anti-liquor agitation. If
it is as true as the hydropathic politicians aver,
that 90 members of the New South Wales as-
sembly are in favour Of Local Option, the members
of that organisation must be just about the best-
represented men in the community. “Every
man his own representative ” must be the pre-
vailing rule among the cold-water-cure political
party. That is if the microscopically small figures
credited to Local Option in the recent New South
Wales ballot is any indication of the number of
adherents to be credited ta the cause. There is
one consideration which must be accorded to these
romantic reformers, and that is the state of
weather prevailing when the vote was re-
corded, Heat such as that then prevailing is a
sore test of teetotalism. When a man carries
in the throat of him a rebellious thirst which it is
mere mockery to attempt to assuage with tea, his
convictions on the liquor question are apt to
undergo a temporary hut radical change. The
blue ribbon must he kept in a cool place if its
presence is to inspire the advocates of salvation
by lemon-squash with genuine and permanent en-
thusiasm. The 90 Parliamentary advocates of
Local Option would do well to pais an amending
Act directing that the annual vote shall be taken
when the thermometer is under 80 and over 60 in
the shade. Then their evangel may be effectively
propped up by the votes of the faiihful, who now
find their enthusiasm scorched to a moral cinder
by the backsliding torridness of February heat.

When the Milburn Creek swindle was before
the New South Wales Parliament some years ago,
and the vote for (hat famous wild-cat fraud
seemed in danger, Parkbs announced that either
the money must he forthcoming or he would
resign. The money was forthcoming. Last week
that other and still greater fraud, the Centennial
Dead-house, was tottering on the verge of
oblivion, and Sir Henry rose on his hind legs and
said sternly that unless the £300,000 which is
wanted for tbe erec ion of his great cold meat
show was voted out of the scanty funds of a semi-
insolvent colony, he wou’d appear no more as
Premier. The money turned up in this caso also.
Same old Parkbs. No one ever knew Parkbs to
re-ign upon a principle, hut he is always prepared
to offer himself up as a burnt sacrifice on the
altar (f his country rather than a daylight politi-
cal robbery should miss fire.
Sir Henry Parkbs last week addressed an
earnest appeal to the electors of Newtown, and
urged them not to vote for the party of “ deserters
and turncoats.” This means, of course, that they
are not to vote for Parkbs, who is himself a
turncoat Protectionist; nor for Three-ball Abi-
gail, who is also a deserter from Protection ; nor
for Clarke, G arrett, Sdthbrland, or Roberts,
who are turncoats everyone from the same cause ;
nor for Mitchell, the Foreign-trade candidate,
who poses as a supporter of labour, and who, all
the same, assisted the owners of the Zealandia
against their white employes when the latter
protested against the Chinese crews by which the
Pacific steamers were manned. It is an eloquent
warning also to keep clear in future of Abbott,
whom the Newtown electors returned only a few
weeks ago, and who stated in the Assembly that
he wms opposed to the scheme for fooling av ay
half a million on a Dead House for people who
had been of no account when they were living,
but that he meant to vote for it at Parkes’ bid-
ding, all the same; and it is a definite hint to
extinguish the Escaped Haynes, who for years
wrote down Parkbs as the lowest, meanest,
and narrowest of human beings, and then>
turned his coat and grovelled at the feet of
the man who said he didn’t want either his sup-
port or his acquaintance. Further, it is rough on
O’Connor, who has always advocated Protection,
though he votes for Pabkes and Foreign-trade ;
and it should serve as a warning to the people of
the adjacent electorate of Redfern who, if they
follow the advice thus given, will ask for the
resignation of the renegade fcCHEY who turned
Lis coat at last election and is preparing to do it
again at an early date. Parkes’ observation is
also a nasty jar to most of the other members of
his party, who follow him on the principle o£
howling for the dog that is uppermost, and a few
more such appeals would stand the great Foreign-
trade faction on its head for good.

“ Accept my thanks for clearing away the futile
buzzing of the Victorian colony of insects which
now infest King-street," writes the courteous Sir
John Robertson in a recent issue of Sydney
Evening News. 1 his remark is apropos of the
Sydney D T.’s criticisms upon John’s abusive
letter on the general damnableness of everything
on the south side of the Murray and the heavenly
description of everything north of that river,
and having thus cleared the ground the old
gentleman once more wades in. John’s pre-
sent object is evidently to promote a war
between New South Wales and Victoria, and
his whole great vocabulary of slang is taxed
to the uttermost for that end. The old
prophet’s cuss dictionary is one of the largest on
record, and, if it is possible to start hostilities
upon the strength of a sublime flow of language*
the venerable Billingsgater will trample in gore
at an early date. At present he has the cordial
support of the E. News in his undertaking, and
Alfred Bennett whoops up the public ani-
mosity, but Alfred’s support is mainly a matter
of stomach. He is privileged to lunch every day
at the Reform Club, Sydney, where Sir John
Robertson is king and drivels in the corner and
curses everything from Sheol to breakfast and
back again, and the honour of associating with
this great man is cheaply purchased by allowing
him to curvet in his wrath over the pages of the
News, If Alfred Bennett, Esq., lunched
somewhere else, the News would be run in the
interests of peace and good-fellowship, and old
John’s curse would have to be inserted at adver-
tising rates. It is thus that history is made.
♦
It is now a dead certainty that Mr. C. A. Good
chap, the present Commissioner of Railways, wi 1
be chairman of the new New South Wales Rail-
way Board. This may or may not be all very well;
anyhow, it cannot be denied that Mr. Qoodchap
is a man of brains and experience. But what can
be said of the proposed appointment, as his col-
leagues, of Messrs. Sydney Smith and Jacob
Garrard ? Mr. Smith is a legislative donkey
who has always brayed to the order of hia
Balaam ; while Mr. Garrard, though he may be.
a decent tradesman, and well worth 15s. a dap
while working at hia handicraft, has been a dis-
mal failure in the field of politics, where his only
distinguishing features have been a readiness to.
shear himself when the wind blew too warm for
his alleged principles, and a first-class stock of
cast-iron cheek. The appointment of two such,
parsons to help control scores of millions of pro-
perty will be the foulest job ever perpetrated in
Australian politics,

That awfully moral Premier who closed the
Sydney theatres on Sunday in the interests of re-
ligion, and the rising generation, and who is sup-
posed by the Sabbatarian party to scan the Sun-
day concerts programmes every Saturday in order
that nothing demoralising shall be presented to.
the public, ought to see how much the tone of the
theatre is lowered on Sundays since he drove the.
Secularists out of it. Serio-comic speeches are,
made, comic songs sung, and repartee and banana?
skins pass freely backward and forward between,
stage, and gallery. Finally, the infuriated audience,
demands its money back, and chases the manager
round the neighbouring slums in a vain attempt,
to reo iver. Premier Parkes’ policy always has
an elevating effect on the community. So has
back-blocks rum.
+
A great fuss is being made about the erection of
dwelling-houses on the tenement system for the
Sydney working men. In the Australian climate
these huge barracks would be hells on earth.
What our workman wants, and is entitled to, and
will have in the long run, is a detached cottage
with an attached piece of land. Fancy an Aus-
tralian working man tramping up four or five
flights of stairs on his way to bed ! Fancy the
atmosphere of such a menagerie, the smells of 50
dinners, some hundreds of dirty pairs of boots,
of soiled clothes, of gutter-gambling children !
Faugh ! Tenements for working men 1 So Eng-
lish, you know. Just throw us in a poorhouse,
and a hereditary aristocracy, and then it will be
time for the worker to enquire about the longitude
of some other “ paradise for the working man."

HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
I Bub the troops did not march until John
icarthur again came on the scene. Thor gh
ijor Johnstone was too ill to write to the
ivernor, he wrote an order to the gaoler at
dney, bidding him to deliver up the body of
at troubles me individual, and to "fail not, as
u will answer the same at jour peril 1” When
a gaoler received that hint he released Mr.
acarthur, who joined the officers in time to
ceive the Major when he came to town. No-
ing could be done without John Macarthur.
a drew up a requisition to Johnstone, in which
i said that “the present alarming state of this
lony meaning, doubtless, of Mr. John Mac
thur—“ induces us most earnestly to implore
iu instantly to place Governor Bllgh under
rest, and to assume the control of the colony.”
ic hollowness of this artifice will be apparent
hen lb is remembered that Macarthur was re
ased from prison by Johnstone so that this inc-
ident lie might be concocted in time. That the
fioers fully understood the lawlessness of their
ition is evident from what followed: “We
edge ourselves, at a moment of less agitation, to
ime forward to support the measure with our
rtunes and our lives.” It is quite needless to
Id, as we shall presently see, that they never did
lythlng of the kind.
* * *
Then the Major wrote to Bligh and lightly
Id him he was called upon to execute a most
linful duty. “ You are charged,” he said, by
te respectable inhabitants with crimes that render
ju unfit to exercise the supreme authority
iother moment in the colony and went on to
id, “ I therefore require you, in His Majesty s
,cred name, to resign your authority, and to sub-
it to be arrested, which I hereby place you
ider by the advice of all my officers, and by the
ivice of every respectable inhabitant of the
twn of Sydney.” The tone and style of this
recious document are so much like those of the
tiers of Mr. Macarthur, that the suspicion of
Is having drafted it at ones suggests itself ; few
ion in the colony at that time had such a facile
ift of lying as he possessed. We have progressed
nee, however.
• * *
lb was about 9 o’clock in the evening
rfcen the soldiers marched up to the cottage iu
ligh-street which served as Government House,
uards had been placed on the road to Parra
latta and elsewhere, and no one was allowed to
ass. Rum had evidently been served out to the
ien, as many of the soldiers were drunk. “ Three
undred men under martial law loaded with
all,” as Bligh characters ically expresses it,
armed the party, and, on arriving at Govern-
lent House, these braves, flushed with patriotism
nd rum, were met at the gate by the Governor’s
aughter, who tried to arrest their career of
lory with her parasol. The Corps rallied gal-
mtly to the charge, however, and, after a spirited
,ttack the stormlng-party succeeded in effecting
,n entrance. Lieutenant Bell was on duty as
;uard, and when he saw his accomplices approach-
ng he ordered his men to prime and load, and
hen joined the marauding gang. He was after-
vards a ncminee member of the Legislative
Jouncil of the colony.
. » •
Biigb had a number of the magistrates of
;he colony at dinner when this Irruption of rum-
lushed ruffianism took place and interrupted
ffie proceedings. The formal notice, signed by
Major Johnstone, was merely a blind, intended to
?lve his action an appearance of fair seeming in
the event of future enquiries being mad?. The
only intimation Bligh received was the approach
of the Corps, as he wrote, “ with colours spread,
and playing the ‘British Grenadiers.’” Bligh
thus describes what happened next: “ I had just
time to call to my orderly sergeant to have my
horses ready, while I went upstairs to put on my
uniform, the family being then in deep mourning;
when, on my return, as I was standing on the
staircase waiting for my servant with my sword,
I saw a number of soldiers rushing upstairs with
their muskets and fixed bayonets, as I conceived
to seize my person. I retired instantly into a
back room, to defeat their object, and to de-
liberate on the means to be adopted for the
restoration of my authority, which, in such a
critical situation, could only be accomplished by
my getting into the interior of the country adja-
cent to Hie Hawkesbury, where I knew the whole
body of the people would flock to my standard.
To this situation I was pursued by the soldiers,
and, after experiencing much insult, was con-
ducted below by Lieutenant Minohin, who told
me that Major Johnstone was waiting for me.”
Johnstone repeated to Bligh what his letter has
already told us, and placed him under arresL
Then the house was ransacked, and the Governor’s
commission, instructions, and other papers and
reports seized, and a guard was set round the
house to prevent Bligh's escape. This is his own
account; the officers maintained that he was found
concealed under a bed, from which he was ex-
tracted at the point of a soldier’s bayonet. There
Is nothing inherently incredible about this version,
but comlrg from the source it does the statement
is probably a l'e. The civil magistrates were at
once placed under arrest.
* * *
Then a reign of terror set in. If any
doubt existed as to the character of the officers of
the New South Wales Corps and their leading
splr t, Mr. John Macarthur, as well as of the real
nature of the revolution they effected, the events
that now followed rapidly dispelled it. The
officers had everything their own way, with no re-
sponsibility for tteir actions, and under these
favourable circumstances they soon showed the
kind of material they were made tf. On the day
following Bligh’s deposition Major Johnstone dis-
missed the magistrates from their offices, and
took proceedings against the other opponents of
bis rule. The attorney Crossley, who prepared
the Indictment against Macarthur, was sent to the
coal mines at Newcastle for seven years. The
officers of the Corps were appointed to the vacant
magistracies, and Judge-Advocate Adkins was
dismissed in favour of Captain Abbott, the same
officer whose nose was pulled for his insolence by
Lieutenant Marshall. It is probable that Atkins
would have been sent to the coal-mines with
Crossley, but the officers presently found that he
might be useful to them ; to they showed him a
document found amorg Bligh’s stolen papers,
which we have already quoted from, charging him
with drunkenness and incapacity. When Mr.
Atkins read this little paper he at once threw in
his lot with the officers and was again appointed
Judge-Advocate by those congenial spirits. As
the holders of the King’s Commission the officers
knew that his acts would have a certain legality
which theirs wanted, so they were content to
bury the past, and possibly to persuade Mr Mac-
arthur to refrain from spurning the Ju*ge-Advo-
cate now that he had the opportunity. The Com-
missary, Palmer, was also dismissed, as
aUo was Robert Campbell, the naval
officer with whom Macarthur had quar-
relied. Macarthur was tried again before
the new Judge-Advocate, promptly acquitted,
and chaired through the streets of the town by
the foldlers, who throughout these proceedings
enjoyed themselves very much indeed.
* * *
It would be ridiculous to expect that the
officers of the New South Wales Corps progressed
so far without invoking Providence Their ras-
cality was of too finished a character for that
One of Johnstone’s —or Maoarthur’s first steps
was to suspend ihe chaplain, but the interests of
religion were not to he allowed to suffer by such a
step as that. A person named Crook, whom
Holt described as a barn ranter whom nobody
would listen to, was appointed to preach, but the
duties of ordinary were discharged by no less a
person than the vivacious Mr. John Macarthur.
This man’s cense of humour was of suoh subtle
fineness as almost to elude the eye He intro-
duced a prayer into the Liturgy for Major John-
stone, styling him Lieutenant-Governor, and
issued a proclamation calling on every well-
disposed Inhabitant ” to join in thanks for the mer-
ciful interposition of Providence in their favor by
“ relieving them without bloodshed from the awful
situation in which they stood before the memor-
able 26th inst." But the finishing touch to this
revolting hypocrisy and squalid caricature of the
ordinances of religion was put by the appoint-
ment of Captain Kemp—whom we have seen
forcing his men to submit to be robbed by Mm
under threat of tbe lash —to celebrate marriages
in the town of Sydney ! Then Mr. Macarthur
was made a magistrate and Colonial Secretary,
and, to quote Dr. Lang, “ the military and grog-
sellers of Sydney were quite vociferous in praise
of the new regime; celebrating the accession of
Major Johnstone with bonfires, laudatory ad-
dresses, and the other customary manifestations
of joy.” In the eyes of this portion of the com-
munity a great moral revolution had been con-
summated, and the right of those concerned to
make and sell rum amply vindicated.
* - *
Bligh was confined in a subaltern’s
I quarters in tbe barracks for twelve months. All
his regulations respecting the King’s stores and the
sett'ers’ supplies were abrogated, and matteis
brought back as far as possible into the con-
dition which existed before the power of the
Corps b?gan to decline. Rum was supplied freely
to the friends of the new Government, with as-
signments of convict-labour and grants of land.
To secure the goodwill even of the convicts, cer-
tain free pardons were made out and given away.
All public meetings were prohibited, except for
the purpose of addressing the new rulers, D'.
Lang gives an instance of the weekly meetings of
Presbyterians being stopped by Lieutenant Ball in
pursuance of tMs order. Persons were asked to
sign the requisition under which as-
sumed the Government, and although only “six
or seven names had been affixed to 'he paptr
when the troops marched from the Barracks,”
about 100 were afterwards found on ic. Of these
many signed through timidity or fear. Mr.
Arndell, a magistrate, who signed an address to
Major Johnstone, addressed a private letter to
Bligh at once, saying that he had done so under
the influence of fear. #
But the climax was reached by Major
Johnstone’s
“ Proclamation !
“ The public peace being happily and, I trust in
Almighty God, permanently established, I hereby
proclaim the cessation of martial law. I have
this day appointed magistrates and other public
functionaries from amongst the most respectable
officers and inhabitants."
“ In future no man shall have just cause to
complain of violence, injustice, or oppres-
sion ; no free man sbaU be teken, imprisoned,
or deprived of his house, land, or liberty but by

The first steps after this noble declaration were
to arrest the settler Snttor and the ex-Provost-
Marshal Gore. The former protested against the
i illegality of the action of the Corps, and the other
had Macarthur for an enemy. Suttor was im-
prisoned for six months in the condemned cell
in Sydney, and Gore for 11 weeks and four days,
after which he was sent to hard labour in the coal
mines of Newcastle for four months. TMs latter
part of tbe sentence was added, possibly, to give
the hapless Provost some idea of what a “just
cause to complain of violence, injustice, or op-
pression" might happen to be. There was an
addendum to this proclamation—all through which
Macarthur’s hand is plainly traceable—which was
addressed to the rank-and-file of the Corps, in
recognition of the bravery and high spirit shown
by those gallant men throughout the trying time.
It was couched in the heroic terms which some of
the generals of history have affected in addressing
their victorious troops after a decisive engage-
ment :
“Soldiers t—Your conduct has endeared you
to every well-disposed inhabitant in this settle-
ment. Persevere in the same honourable path,
and you will establish the credit of the New South
Wales Corps on a basis not to be shaken.
“ God Save the King I”
There is a rough, blistering irony about this, the
force of which further words would only weaken.

One of the first steps taken by Johnstone
was to communicate with his commanding officer,
Colonel Paterson, then in Van Diemen’s Land
He informed him oi what had been done, and it.-
vited him to come ard assume the supreme autho-
rity. But that astute officer too well knew the bind
of warriors he commanded, and what they wore
capable of, to put his head in a noose like that.
He had quite enough of the wisdom of the serpent
to keep him out of harm’s way ; so ho sent back a
reply, informing Major Johnstone’s party that, as
they had begun a revolution they might finish it
amongst themselves. So Johnstone continued to
hold office until the arrival of Colonel Foveaux,
who returned from England whither he had been to
attend an enquiry into his action as gaoler of Nor-
folk Island. Still later, Paterson came over from
Van Diemen’s Land, when he thought that step
could be taken with perfect safety, and suspended
Foveaux. During the term of the officers’ rule
more land grants were given away than under any
previous ruler, and the officers were careful to
make hay while the sun of their prosperity shone.
The settlers and the general population fell back
into the misery from which Biigh had but tem-
porarily rescued them. And this was tbe Revolu-
tion of 1808.
The Wail of Ah Haynes.
We have learned for the first time that the ram-
pant Haynes, is a Chinaman. We
would never have guessed it had he not revealed
the fact himself, but the following paragraph
from the Sunday News, a humble sausage-wrap
whi'h John edits, places it apparently beyond
question
Mr. Alfred Miller fought well in the Newtown con-
test, and made a fearful exposure of Traill, editor of
Toohey s denominational or;*an, in regard to nis emp os m<
Chinese at The Bulletin office. By the way, The Bul-
letin people are atiout to publish an Anti- Jb. inese numt e ,
It in amusing V> n te that the very tables on which the papers
will be packed were made by Chinamen, to the order of Mr. W.
H. Traill, who got them sneaked into the office when all
the white workmen had gone away
It chances, unfortunately for the Escaped John s
argument, that the fittings of The Bulletin
office, including the tables aforesaid, were erected
entirely by his own brother. The gentleman in
question certainly looked like an Irishman ; he
used to tell agreeable yarns about the Gold Sad
while he was superintending the work; he bad a
brogue instead of a pigtail, and he never wor-
shipped Joss—or at all events, if he did so it was
in secret, and he was never known to burn incense
to any heathen deity on the premises. We cer-
tainly took him for a pleasant little gentleman
from Cork, and it comes upon us as a sudden
shock to learn that he was, after all, a dis-
guised Chinaman. The firm employed by Mr.
Haynes to do the vork under his supervision
was that of John Wright and Sons, Kdgeware
Road, Bnmore, Sydney, and the members thereof
have always worn the outward aspect of white
men, both in their countenances and their deal-
ings. It remains, therefore, for Mr. John
Haynes, M.L.A., either to disown his own
brother or to admit that he himself is a China-
man, and if the brother in question refuses to be
disowned we would like to know what John is
going to do about it. We have some delicacy in
offering thin explanation, nob being accustomed,
like Ah Haynes, to write about ourselves, and
we have some delicacy also in writing about Ah
Haynes since we have discovered him to be a
Chinaman, but if we had the time and inclina-
tion to set down all we know about that
gentleman we could supply a remarkable
chapter of Australian political history. As
to Mr. Haynes’, M.L.A.’s, denunciation of Mr.
George Dibbs as a “ hollow-hearted failure," we
need only remark that the journal in which Ah
Mudgkb Js privileged to write comes out under
the auspices of Mr. John Shepherd, the deadly
personal enemy of that same Mr. George Dibbs
who, when Mr. Haynes and the present editor of
The’ Bulletin were in Darlinghurst gaol for un-
paid cosbs, was the first and foremost man to
stand their friend.

Messrs. Branton and Sons, the well-
known millers of Victoria and Queensland, opened
their splendid mills at Clyde, N.S.W., last week,
with a stand-up banquet, A large and voluble
crowd was present, the baking fraternity espeol-
ally mustering very strongly on the occasion.
Messrs. Roth and Co., the Sydney agents
for Delbeck’s champagne and Marie Brlzard’s
wines, gave a Delbeok champagne banquet at
Frank Smith’s grounds at Botany one evening
last week. The guests were unanimous in their
approval of the brand, and a large quantity was
consumed in the course of the proceedings.
"“During 1887, 52 mining companies were
floated in Great Britain to work Australian mines
with a total nominal capital of £7,508,000. The
largest established mine of the year was the
British Broken Hill Proprietary, with a capital of
£1,200,000. This money is largely the cause of
the silver boom, most of it having been, in mining
parlance, “ banged in again.”
Sydney D.T. has discovered that Dibbs,
who lately stated that he had been a Freetrader
“from his youth up,” said not long ago in public
that “when joung he was favourable to Pro-
tection." Having thus pilloried Dibbs, the D.T.
had better double-column the various utterances
of Parkes, Garrett, Clarke, Roberts, Abigail,
Sutherland, &c , on the same subject.
T here have of late been statements in the
Sydney papers, to the effect that severe action
was to be taken by the Reform Club in the matter
of the Dibbs-Garrett slanging-match. To enable
the public to iudge of the qualifications of the
Reform Club as a oersor of morality, it may be
stated that it is the boast of its members that
they drank the Club out of a heavy debt in a few
months.
It is stated that in the island of Gomera,
one of the Canaries, the inhabitants have a
whistle-language by which they communicate
with each other across gorges. We can beat that.
Some of our members of Parliament and aldermen
and other eminent guzzlers have a bicoup lan-
guage by means of which, on festive occasions,
they communicate with each other —also across
gorges.
When, the other day, Sir Robert Wisdom,
of N.S.W., announced his conversion to Protec-
tion, lt]was understood that the change of opinion
had come about in consequence of what Robert

in t raat Britain, Wisdom defended the Freotrade
policy of New South Wales, and that, immediately

he badly wants, but which wouldn’t do him much

Mr. Charles Warner, as was foreshadowed
on his debut night, is crowding Melbourne Royal
in all parts except the dress circle, where the
finest acting is unappreciated unless the actor
wears purple and fine linen, or sings a song.
There is little fault to find with the setting of this
dramatic gem, and, although Coupeau is the only
human character in “ Drink,” many of the others
contrive to throw in touches of nature which
make the whole thing gee. As far as a well-nur-
tured form and full, rich voice will allow, Mies
Isabel Morris represents Qervalse. If she can t
look lean, or talk as though she only gets meat
one * a week, wo must saddle ths blame on Natur.
Miss Watt-Tanner makes all she can of Virginia,
the woman whose one ambition is to destroy the
body and soul of a plumber because his wife
whacked her in a wash-house so “many years
ago.” The way in which Virginia dodges about
Coupeau for half-a-dozen acts seems preposterous
upon calm reflection, but the lady mentioned
throws a glamour of possibility round her wicked-
ness with a light artistic hand. There is
fire in the Gorget of Mr. Herbert Flem-
ming and a genuine ring about the
backhander with which he impresses the beauties
of temperance upon boozy Mea Bottes. Mr.
Alfred Phillips, who came out as aide-de-camp to
Warner, plays this part sufficiently well, and

Years ago in the simple, unsophisticated
past, the people of a certain Inland town in N.S. W.
teSolved that they wanted a railway. They had a
gaol already, but they refused to be satisfied and
were pre-eminent in grief. So they started to
agitate, the leading grocer and his chum-in-woe,
the tailor, taking up the cause valiantly, and at
last they got what they wanted, and a new line
was constructed right through the town. The
grocer hoorayed when the first train started, and
concluded that his fortune was made ; to day he
blasphemes instead, and offers rewards to any-
body who will tear up the line and remove it In a
wheelbarrow. In the old days his customers
used to pay—sometime ; but now they run up a
score till they can’t get any more credit, and then
they take a return-ticket and buy their supplies
in the next town. This sort of thing went on till
the shopkeeper’s intellect became so undermined
that even the exertion of keeping his own
hair on was too much for him, and then he
started out on the warpath, and said It was
his day to whoop. There is only one
train per diem in these latitudes, and when
it starts the grocer is on the platform
with his ledger under his arm, and, walk-
ing along the line of carriages, he reads out ths
amount each passenger owes him, with particu-
lars about the difficulty he experiences in getting
the money and the reasons he has for not expect-
ing to get it at all. The butcher, the baker, and
the tailor follow his example, and help to make
things eminently agreeable. At the Centennial
time half the local insolvents were going to Syd-
ney in a body, and the other half were seeing
them off, and the four tradesmen stood on the
platform reading off the list of bad debts as hard
as they could gabble. Even then the grocer
couldn't get through the catalogue In time, but he
ran beside the train for In If a-mile whooping out
the over due accounts, till at last the steam-horse
left him behind, and then, as he fell from utter
exhaustion, he fired his final shot by screaming
after the retreating excursionists, “ Twenty-two
other accounts will be read out at the next oppor-
tunity." Times are bad in N.S.W., but still we
have an impression that that man will ultimately
get his money. Perseverance and industry
seldom fail to achieve their reward, as instanced
in the case of Parkes, who started life with a six-
pence, and has gradually risen till he owes more
money than he ever saw.

The Executive Committee of the Melbourne
Exhibition Commission have rolled their eyes in
fine frenzy over 257 “ Opening Cantatas ” sent in
on approbation by 257 candidates for two prizes.
Poetry turned out by competitive examination
bards on the off chance of * ‘ knocking ” an Exhi-
bition committee is not likely to bo much better
than Tennyson's odes executed to the order of his
gracious Queen. Nevertheless, a glanca at the
three Cantatas which were placed (two getting
prizes and the third saving his stake) impresses
one with a notion that a particularly thag-bag
field started for this event. Or else—as the third
is distinctly superior to the second, and the second
knocks spots off the first—perhaps the worse Can-
tata scooped the 50-guinea pool. A local Congre-
gational parson—Rev. William Allen—is the
happy man, and here is a piece of his priza Can-
tata
“ Said of old the mighty master
(Speaking he of halls Infernal,
Where the lords of hell assembledK
That from earth the enormous fabric
Rose up like an exhalation !
So arose the stately structure,
Rose the temple walls supernal,
Of the commonwealth Australian.”
It is naughty of the parson to remind us that
civilised JVusfcralia has been constructed on similar
lines to the Infernal halls of Sheol, and it is incor-
rect to talk about a “commonwealth” while Her
Gracious continues to billet her representatives on
this devoted young country. The rest of the
screed is remarkable for nothing except that it is
superlatively dear at twelve shillings a line, and
wouldn't be printed gratis by any paper bar
Sydney Hevenun Noose, The second prize can-
tata is stronger in sentiment than expression, but
may be regarded as dirt-cheap, comparatively, at
six shillings a lina. It’s argument makes out that
Peace and Freedom gave up the historic Old
World in disgust, and came to New South Wales
in answer to a song of welcome-warbled by
«• our first families,” presumably. Although the
Argos howls against the “ offensive tone” of this
cantata, it is a melancholy faot that the bard gets
feeble in his-final chorus, and asks us to
“ Weld Empire's links, as enterprise uproars
Australia’s record of a hundred years.”
T;hat smacks of Imperial Federation, and we like
it not. Mr. J. W. Meaden, who has previously
scored In this class of work, gets the barren
honour of a place for a composition which contains
several graceful fanoles put in graceful versa.
But this doesn’t fit in with The Bulletin’s
weekly record of grim facts—
“ Then labour leaped upon the strand,
‘Hoi’ merrily laughed he,
And beckoned, with his brawny hand,
To those across the sea."
I Labour never leaped upon the strand of Botany
Bay. It just loafed on, with its legs in irons, and
cursed at the soldiers who pricked It up with
their bayonets. No, all things considered, Mel-
bourne Exhibition had better open with a rousing
nigger chcras and let the Cantatas sl'cle down the
slippery slopes of obscurity into the dark abjss of

years ago that famous political economist entered
his indignant protest against Chine :e cheap

There is in Australia a certain holy city
which runs many charities, and it takes stacks of
money to keep them going. Collection-boxes are
hung up In every sinful public-house and in every
depraved, low. mean, wicked billiard-room, and
each blessed Y.M.C.A. has one in the vestibule.
The week before last the time came round for
hooking in the dross, and the collectors started
out. A young man with unimpeachable testi-
monials, who is so honest that if you left a lot of
money with him without counting it you would
find more than you expeoted when you came back,
was despatched with a sack to fake np the coin
f om the V.M.C.A , It being considered that the
fellow who csull be trusted with the most money
should take that part cf the duty ; and some other
young men, who! emorals s osd very high, though
they were not quite equal to the shining light
aforesaid, and who could be allowed to remain in
the same room with a sixpence with a reasonable
hope that the efin wou 1 d be recovered when they
were searched at the police station, were sent
round the hotels The results wsre not quite all
that wa’ expected. The radiant youth who went
to the V.M C.A, returned with six buttons,
two or three bits of stick, a bad penny, a brass ring,
part of a half-eaten apple, and a copy of a pro-
fane pamphlet, while the others brought a pound
or so from each wicked hotel. And now the ques-
tion of the day la—whether the blaaphe r ous bul-
lock-driver and tbe seedy billiard-sharp are really
so much more generous than the children of
light, or whether the moral young man who re-
turned the half-eaten apple and the other
wreckage as his entire gains isn’t really so moral
as he looks. He has been questioned on the sub-
ject, and says he is as moral as he ever was, but
a lot of other very moral peop’e have their doubts
about him.
It was Centennial night in Sydney, and
two men were drunk in a fashionable Club. They
were rot merely tight but drunk—weeping, wall-
ing drunk ; they both belonged to the first families
of N.S.W., and, as they leaned up against the
wall, they whooped at intervals, and said they
wouldn’t go home till morning. They had for-
gotten who they were and all about themselves ;
they ciuldn't even tell for certain whether they
were white or Chinese, but one of them said feebly
to the other : “ Cummerlong, ole filer, ’ave anor-
rerrer branny,” and his friend fixed a fishy, lustre-
less orb upon him and moaned: “ Gimmy glash
whish-hisky and zlg-hlg-gar,” Oatsi e a cab was
waiting for them, and the driver had also been
centenniatiog. One of the first families fell with his
head out of the window, and screamed in falsetto :
“ WhArly ’ave? ” and a voice responded through
the darkness, “ Bee-e-ehear.” It was sent out to
him, and ha fell off the box In his efforts to drink
it. Ultimately, he got most of it into his ear, and
then he lay still in the gutter, and for a while
there was a dead silence, in the course of which
you could hear the mud accumulating in the street.
The only sober thing in the crowd was the horte,
Presently, an uncertain voice was heard in the in-
terior of the Club ; the owner was drinking “ Gor
save—Aic—quea—yah,” and his companion ioiaed
in the sentiment, and said with borzy solemnity,
“Gor save—oh, lor I’ Then there ensued an
order to “Giver filer ouahlde norrerrer—noirer
be-er." It was given, and the cabman spilled It
down his back in bis efforts to find bis mouth.
“ IS’posh horsh like a dr-hink.” said the tightest of
the first families to the waiter. “Ashk horsh
wharlyave.” The waiter kept his countenance,
and said “ Yessir.” There was aiother stoppage.
At last one of the revellers awoke from a dream,
and s ‘id to hla friend confidentially, “ Shorge, y r
awfily drunk.” “Sho’s you.” An interval of
three-quarters of an hour followed, and then the
pair arose, and said, mutually, “Lesh gome.”
The funeral got as far as the doorstep, where it
srt down for 35 minutes, and then toe two
colonists lurched heavily over, and awoke the
cabman, and asked him who the doooe they were.
The cabman didn’t know, but he said he was the
Emperor of Shiny. When they had assimilated
this fact, a discussion arose as to which of them
was the cabman, and the younger of the two said
he wished he were a bird, and fell asleep with his
head on the pavement and his feet inside the
doorway. The waiter came along presently and
shut the door on h?s feet with a shook which
stopped the circulation, and the party woke up
end asked the flarksy to come out and flgbt
100,000 rounds Toe waitu- excused himself
however, and lifted (hem into the cab and the
daver hung on to the step behind and told (he
hoi S 3 to go to sheol. The horse went a few yards
on the way and then fell asleep In the next street.
The cabman dropped off, and whispering mourn-
fully that ha was the Emperor of Shiny and' that
ha wanted to be interred under a spreading tree
he also slumbered. The two passengers slept
heavily inside, and the night passed peacefully.
Next morning an early policeman woke up the
procession and took it back to the club where it
was put to bed, while the driver was jerked away
to gaol and fined 10s, That’s all.

“It is stated on good authority that

The Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus
Co., which is now one of the biggest things in the
world, is about to water its stock.
The man we are about to speak of is what
la commonly called a cool customer. But ho is an
uncommonly cool one. The thermometer Is
always several degress below zero in his imme-
diate atmosphere. He went Into Cole’s Book Arcade
in Melbourne one day, and asked an assistant to
find him a copy o! a certain valuable book. The
assistant found It and said pleasantly, after the
usual manner of the book-liar : “ You are lucky,
sir; this is the last copy we have.” “Ob it
doesn’t matter," replied the Iceberg; “ m ’not
Ceprive you of it. I’Jl just sit down here and
read it.” And he took a chair, and sat down and
read with an unruffled brow. The assistant
wiped his fevered forehead, and then went feebly
away to attend to somebody else. After a while
the Glacier called him over, and said, In a tone of
severe remonstrance, “Young man, what is the
meaning of this ? There are not more than a
third of the leaves of this book cut. You can’t do
business that way, you know. Cut ’em at once,
please.” This was too much, even for the mild
assistant, and the denouement of the affair was
that the Ics Hummock was trundled out of the
place, exclaiming all the time that “ This was no
way to do business."
DOWN UPON PARSONS.
Alas! the poor old parsons—though we like not
to revile ’em,
It seems they find us subjects for the lunatic
asylum.
Then better live unorthodox—on Bible matters
hazy—
Than die in Holy Orders, leaving children that
are crazy.
Alas! the poor old parsons—they are fond of
getting married.
So It’s time a resolution was unanimously carried
Forbidding such a practice, as the source of cruel
dangers
To their pledges of affection—thoss unhappy little
strangers I
Immoral William tells ua that this world is mad,
my masters—
So it doesn’t want assistance from its too prolific
pastors,
Wnose children (wo are shaking now our weary
head in sadness)
Inherit not that genius which is near akin to
madness.
Fare thee well. Most Reverend Barry,
You have got a “ call" to go,
Here with us you must not tarry,
Long ago wa told you so.
Well we know the ways of holy
Men who wear the sleeves of lawn,
Though the'r talk is mesk and lowly,
They high places must adorn.
They will tell with air so saintly
Of the ways of Providence,
That the thought will press but faintly
That ’iis “ screw” that “calls” them hence !
Fare thee well, but not in sorrow,
As with you, so with the next,
“ Here to-day and gone to-morrow ”
Surely is our Bishops' text!
Dreaming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Slowly, while the shadows creeping
Press the crimson from the sky,
Till the prisoned waters sleeping
Like a void of darkness lie,
And the night-winds rise and sweep on
Hill-sides that in blackness steepen,
Let me rove; while fancies deepen
All the scene’s solemnity.
Passing onwards, dreaming ever,
For a thousand visions glide
Weirdly down the vales that sever
Wooded side from wcoded side ;
And the feet grow still in wonder,
As the gloom is pierced asunder
By the mystic thoughts that under
Bush and crag In lurking hide.
And, adown the outlook, shimmer
Strangely upwards through the night,
L’ghts that gleam and lights that glimmer
Lurid on the startled sight;
And the town, in distance glowing,
Seems with stars and meteors flowing—
Seems through heaven its lustre throwing
Like some constellation bright.
Glorious, radiant, all-pervading.
As the twilight dies, it springs ;
And the hills, in darkness fading,
Draw from view their shadowy things.
And the only sight is laden
With the splendour of an Aldenn—
Looks a lone and lustrous Aidenn
To the glad imaginings.
Dreaming thus, and only dreaming,
For the shades are cold and dead,
And the lights are feebly gleaming,
And a pallid lustre shed ;
And the town is worn with scheming,
And its Aidenn but a seeming,
And the echoes round it streaming
Quiver with a sound of dread.
Dreaming I Ay, and therefore dreaming,
For the wakening comes too soon,
And the change from real to seeming
Is our life’s most precious been.
Yet, who knows ? There may be for us
That shall swell our thinkful chorus
Clearer than iu dreams th&t o'er us
Move with grand, majestic tune.
For our fathers dreamed before us,
And their dreams round ua are strewn.
Real, achieved, completed for us,
On the rocks of Being hewn.
And, of all the fancies teeming
With the light of gladness beaming,
Some, that now are evening dreaming.
May be more than dreams at noon.

aptly illustrate certain phases of colonial p ih.ics and life.
This will indeed prove a sweapicg advertisement
for the colony. Mr. Currey also adds that—
It is a characteristically curious feature of N S.W. poUtics
that a large majority of those worshippers who now laud and
magnify Sir Henry Parkes as little less than a demigod and
founder of the colony’s prosperity, would, five years ago,
have consigned him to summary burial, vehement anathe-
mas, and danced on his grave.
For laying a brain to gat material for

Samuel Vincent Winter, of Melbourne Herald.
Take this for example “ Sub-Inspector Larkin,
who was recently promoted from the position of
Sargeant, made bis first appearance In hla new

aoeepted as a c allenge by the Little Boarka-
street roughs-aa Mr. Winter well knows-and
there will be a torn uniform, a hair-stiffening
paragraph in the Her ald, and six months, where
there is no beer sold, for somebody. Who will get
up to deny tlie power of the Press, afcer this?

Alexander Fawkaer Sullivan, the Mel-
bourne Club man who was a co-respondent in the
great divorce suit, Malpis v. Maipas, heard in
Melbourne not long since bemre Chief Justice
Higlntotham, has just died in London. Stillivan
was a wealthy squatter, owning big stations on
the Paroo (K.S.W.) and Darling Downs (Q )• He
was well-known in sporting circles, and when the
events occurred, years sgo, on accmut "bids
he was made a party to the Malpas divorce suit
ha was a gay young spark of six-and- twenty, who
used to ride his own horses at country races.
Sullivan was found guilty of adultery by the jury,
but the case was carried before the Full Court,
aud a new trial was ordered on the ground that
th 3 verdict as it affected Sullivan was against the
evidence, The principal points raised against
this co-raspondent were that on one occasion
when Mrs. Malpas and other ladies were sleeping
in an apartment in whioh they were separated
from Sullivan’s only by a partition, Mrs.
M and Sullivan threw things across at
one another, and that on another occasion
Mrs. M, rode in a buggy with Mr. S. up-country
In N.S.W.. and overshot the station (purposely as
alleged! and got rid of the rest of the party travel-
ling wlch them. When the Full Court ordered a
new trial, Mr. Malpas agreed to dispense with
Mr Sullivan as a co respondent (Malpas a groom
was a second), and to state that he withdrew from
the suit without any stain on his character. Had
the verdict against Sullivan been sustained, his
share of the petitioner’s costs would have amounted
to £BOOO or £9OOO. As it was, the case cost him
only about £5OO. _

Down at Ballarat
there is an cld miner
who owns a dog, which
is alsr well up In years
and is the worst-kicked
animal in Victoria. Every
time the dog looms on the
horizon its owner gives
chase and he will run a
mile for the satisfaction
of landing his boot in
the faithful quadruped’s
ribs. The history of
this animosity dates hack
many years. At a time
when both the dog and
his master were a good
deal younger than they
are now the one was fos-
sicking near Ballarat and
the other was tied up to
a log in thenesr vicinity
He scratched out a deep
hole alongside the log in
course rf time, and when
his proprietor gave up
the locality in despair and
moved on, another fel-
low came alor g and drove
his pick into the shal-
low sinking which the
canine had left behind
him. Two inches below
the surface he discovered
a stupendous nugget and
rolled in wealth for the
rest of his life, and when
the miserable prospector
heard of it he curstd the
dog as the cause of his
undoing, and kicked it
ever afterwards for not
scratching that hole a
little deeper.
One of the most
touching little incidents
in the history of the late
experiments to remedy
the N.S.W. rabbit rest is
Mr. Stanley’s failure to
discover microbes. Drs.
Ellis and Butcher a e
scientists who have de-
voted their lives to the
minute investigation of
disease. Mr. Stanley,
however, is a N.S.W.
Government veterinarian
Ind in this capacity is, of course, in the mind of
rery right-thinking citizen, entitled to give an
pinion which knocks the evidence of scientific
(search into a cooked hat. He “only wishes
iat. he could give the doctors a more favourable
pinion,” and consequently they, if they know their
laces, will metaphorically wilt and die. It doean t
latter to Stanley that rabbits keep on dying; what
e requires is the festive microbe, and until one
alks up, grasps him by the hand, takes his bat
ff and mutters, “Mister Stanley, I presume!
e refuses to bo convinced. Then, again, he
zanders about the paddock at Tintinallogy cry-
ig, “ Bring out your dead. Trot out your exter-
ilnated rabbit-pest 1 Produce the extinoted
Pdent! ” The soft sou h wind rustling through
tie gum-leaves Is his only answer. Satisfied that
ae corpses are not r he retires, and then, ga c ping
ut their final sob, the rabbits crawl from their
übterranean homos, and, giving one last shiver,
le by hundreds ia the sunlight. It is a most
oculiar thing to note the down those rabbits and
licrobes seem to have on Stanley. They don C
eem to recognise what is due to a Government
eterlnarlan.

Something very rough has happened to

basis; and at Southwark (Bng.) another Home
Ruler has been returned by a majority of 1191
votes over the Tory howler of the hour.

You might say what wain’t true—
For instance, call ME Snob, which would be coarse.

teats, mangy dogs, are all subject to its removing power,
while it is sold at common soap price. The genuine testi-
monials which Mr. James has from ministers, missionaries,

S’kcj the Yogel Ministry collapsed In
N. Z. ic has been a cold day for the Civil Service.
Everybody has been retrenched within an inch of
his life ; the meat fer the offlce-cat is now de-
ducted from the salaries instead of being charged
to the Consolidated Revenue, the clerks have to
bring their lunch in a newspaper instead of going
out for i”, and the time spent in consumirg the
sandwich is estimated and valued and initialled
and then charged against the pension to which
each man is entitled when he has bean about 800
years in the servlca ; only the heads of depart
ments are allowed to assume two clean collars a
week lest they should demoralise the office by
becoming suddenly and violently autocratic and
by putting on airs ; and the boys travel by cattle-
trnck when they go away on their annual holi-
day. Consequently it is now the winter of the
Treasury dude's discontent, and be goes about
with his head hanging down and his legs trailing
sorrowfully behind him. The other day one of the
choice youths of the service, worn out by yanking
and straining and hauling at the machine of State
for 12 months, was starting for a fortnight’s travel,
and the affable Vogel met him cn the wharf and
shook hands in that pleasant, condescending way
of his which always breaks a man up so that his
eye-glass falls into the soup. “ Going South, Mr.
Brown, I suppose ? ” said Sir J alius with a smile
that a camel might have got through on his way
to the Kingdom of Heaven. “ Yes, Sir Julius,"
“Ah, Dunedin, I suppose,” rejoined the ex-
Treasurer, with a far-away look in his eyes like
one whose thoughts were turned back to the days
of old long since; “ Pleasant place, isn’t it ?
Beautiful scenery. I spent some happy years
there myself. You are going to Dunedin, aren’t
you ? ” “ Yes, Sir Julius." “ Ah, you couldn’t do
better. And, I say —— ” here Vogel’s voice sank
to a husky, impressive whisper expressive of
Christian sympathy and deep emotion —“ Red
Lion Hotel—Staffordetreet—Clean beds—one
shilling.” And with that he wandered slowly
down the wharf, and left a flabbergasted dude
gazing after him. That young man has now re-
solved to vote bis hardest for Sir Julius at next
election. During the days of the Vogel Ministry
he used to put up at the Grand, but a few months
of Atkinson’s rule has reduced him so low that
his old chief has to tell him with tears in his voice
where to get a clean bed for one shilling,

Duncan Gillie a told Baron Brassey that
all the Influential billets in Victoria were held by
gentlemen devoted to the British Crown, who
made a point of proclaiming their loyalty oh every
possible occasion, so as to keep Democracy well
covered up. When Duncan artlessly explained
how the Imperial game is played he never thought
Brassey would give him away to a London inter-
viewer ; but the dull Baron saw nothing singular
in Duncan’s admission. To him it seemed per-
fectly in accordance with grand old British prece-
dents that the growl of the many should be
drowned by the roar of an interested few. By the
way, isn’t it about time that Gillies was knighted ?

The Sydney Morning Herald states that

cousins who have made money by quicker if more
devious mems than the honest ouvrieres of
Sydcey employ? Even as it is, any “work
girl ” can, if her eoul be small enough and her
dress decent, attend her Ladyship’s “receptions”
and strut through Govlngment ’Onse side by side
with My Lord and My Lady twice per month.
Yet when she is invited to buns and flat pop under

stricken, that shs was given the run ot the front

word “even.’ It is indeed sublimely “Heraldic,”

Amongst the distinguished fraternity of
ex-colonial bishops, who honour London with
their pious presence, is Charles Perry, D.D., by
the Grace, &c., ex-prelate of Melbourne. Charles
came out to the Southern colony in 1847, and made
way a few years ago for Bishop Moorhouse. We
mention Dr. Perry just now because we are re-
minded by an old chum of a little speech delivered
by him a quarter of a century ago. One of his
clerical assistants was a worthy gentleman who
was reputedly a wealthy man, owning houses and
lands and other solid things not generally con-
sidered consistent with the poverty of the
Apostles. But, notwithstanding his wealth the
reverend assistant had no “official” residence,
and a meeting of parish! enera was called to take
the mat er Into consideration. At this meeting
Dr. Perry appeared and made a pathetic appeal
for funds to erect a vicarage for their “beloved
friend who had not a roof to cover his head,” &o ,
&o. Many of the congre ration sniggered at the
appeal, as it was a well-known fact that the
reverend landlord's ageat in collecting his rents
was accompanied regularly each Monday by a
bailiff, and if the co’n were not forthcoming a
“ man was lefo in possession.” Ah—j ust for form’s
sake, you know —ah —good morning, and God

Here is an obituary from the Jehoshaphat
column of a Southern paper
Loving father, true and kind,
He was to us in heart and mind.
Peaceful husband, too, as well,
When he upon this earth d ! d dwell.
“ Peaceful husband ”is a master-stroke. What a
world of meaning there is in it 1 “ Loving hus-
band” is tbs usual term in this old-fashioned
eleglao quatrain (you will at once perceive from
the turn cf the foregoing sentence that we have
been giving a good deal of our nights and days to
Addison lately). The lorn widow who paid half-
a-orown, or whatever the sordid charge is, for
the insertion of the above memorial, with the
light touch of genius made It human and natural,
and, so to speak, up to date. She knew thst the
loving husband of the obituaries la in the habit,
while alive, of breaking his wife’s bead once a
fortnight, or thereabouts, and then —with vinous
breath, and the ready tears that spring from rum
in his eyes—trying to kiss it well again. Mark,
too, the fine discrimination between the character
of the lamented as a father and as a husband. He
was a “loving” father, but only a “peaceful”
husband. Yet that was saying much as husbands
go in these times. He evidently did not Emash
the time-payment furniture or retire into a back
room to hack at his larnyx with the carving-knife
when there was no money fer beer in the house.
If there was no money for beer he simply tried to
get it on credit, and if that was a failure he went
to bed and drew the counterpane over his eyes
and was heard of to more that night. He
was, also, a silent drinker and never tore around
the terrace in the dead of night with a poker in
his hand howling for somebody to come out and
be killed. No ; when he drank till ho tould hold
no more, he gurgled out a blessing upon every-
body, hiccuped a prayer to heaven, and then, like
a gorged frrg, curled himself up in any odd corner
handy and made no more noise than a haystack
till morning. Also he was never given to tooting
on the trombone, nor seized with the flute-dieease.
He was exactly what the obituary says a peace-
ful husband who never made a noise, except when
he was eating. This is the sort of man who
deserves a more circumstantial tribute to his
virtues than that given by his poor sorrowing
widow. Pass the muffled Jews’-harp :
He never smashed the grand piano.
He never broke a pot or pan;
All, who read, by these lines can know
He was a very peaceful man.
He died as quiet as a goat,
And made no rattle in his throat.
We scarce had known that it was death
But that—we missed his robust breath.
By the way, when speaking of epitaphs, we
wonder what sort of a legend of gilded grief and

Governor Loch’s visit to the Queens clifl'e
(Vic.) Battery the other day led to something that
was pretty near a revolution, accompanied by in
subordination, riot, sultry language, and breach
of the peace, and aggravated by a tendency to
darn his Excellency's eyes. It was race-day at
Geelong, and the soldiers had hired a trap and in-
tended to Imbibe long beers on the course and bet
on the bobtailed nag, and then, just as they were
ready to start, Sir Henry came down, and they
had to march and countermarch and lug heavy
ordnance about under the solar rays, and haul at
bulky ammunition, and do all sorts of superhuman
shoving that there was no sort of necessity for.
Presently they begun to ask “ wot the old bloke
meant by this ’ere,” and why he didn't come down
and do the dashed job himself, and then there
arose smothered murmurs about shying mud at
’is ’ead, and at last half the corps arose with a
snort of sedition, and demanded to know where
he bought that hat, and uttered other disloyal sen-
timents They were promptly hauled off to the
guard-room to await their doom, and next morn-
ing at 8.40 they were blown up by an officer and
told that they must walk a chalk-line for the rest
of their natural lives. For our own part, our
sympathies are with the afflicted troops. We
don’t see why any Governor should come down
and make a lot of men at 15s. a week haul big
guns out, and then hanl them back again and do
the goose-step and perpetrate other fooleries ;
besides, the rules of civilised warfare ctmpel one
nation, before making an attack upon another, to
write politely requesting to be informed when
their de f enders will be disengaged and ready to
receive them, and Sir H. Loch might at least have
been as courteous.

This is not in every sense a strictly moral
item, but at a time like this, when the hog of
sin io wallowing in the spring of life, it is hard to
fix up enough moral items to fill the paper. It
occurred at Auckland (N.Z.), and the local organ
described it as an “amusng Incident." The
fellow who runs that paper has strange ideas on
the subject of amusement. It was the day when
the San Francisco steamer tailed, and a local
tradesman, having wandered down to the wharf,
thought he would step on board for a tour of In-
spection. He had one foot on the gangway and
the other in the air when a cheeky boy in uni-
form told him that visitors weren’t allowed on
board. Having an admiration for shipping, and
being buoyed up by the recollection that he had
left a swivel-eyed youth of great integrily to take
care of the shop in his absence, he next sat down
oa a coil of ropes and proceeded to run his eye
over the vessel from an outsider's point of view,
but his eye hadn’t run long before it concussed
violently against his wife, who was standing on
the deck. He gave her the usual meaningless
marital grin, to which she coldly responded with
a very formal bow. He then reared up and reared
through his hards, “What was she doing on
the ship if visitors weren’t allowed ?” The
lady only dived out of sight without a
reply, and her husband, with one wild
thought of how could he pay a housekeeper
to look after him, rushed the ship, and started cn
a search for the lady. He found her on all-fours
under the saloon table, weeping, and lifting her
out he asked her what was she doing, and why
didn’t she come off when visitors weren’t allowed?
She only wept on ; but when he told her to come
off with him, she dried her eyes on her bonnet-
strings, and led him to infer that wild horses
wouldn’t make her budge from the spot she stood
on. At that moment the last bell rang, and the
Auckland shopman, with a cold light in his eye,
seized his giddy better-half in bis arms, and ran
off the ship with her amidst roars of unfeeling
laughter. They went home together In silence,
and, on arriving there, he sternly lugged her up-
stairs and sent her to bed, after which he locked
up her bonnet, boots, and stockings in a cupboard,
not necessarily for publication but as a guarantee
of good faith, and also turned tae key upon her.
Then he went out to make enquiries, and learned
that, owing to his prompt action, another trades-
man was eloping alone across the ocean. How
that other man feels about it is not yet known,
but he will probably express himself on a post-
card when he gets to ’Frisco.

A lean and hungry-looking man was roam-

months society had been cantering on his pros-
trate form, and he was dead-tired cf a hay diet
and empty enough to eat a bull’s-tail raw if he
were only able to wrench it off. He had bis
hands in Ifis pockets and was whistling the tune
that the old cow died of, when suddenly he
observed a turkey hanging under a hotel veran-
dah, and, gently disengaging it. he fled down the
street. He sold it at the next hotel, and the land-
lord hung It under the verandah. Then he softly
annexed it again and ran round to a boarding-
house, where the landlady bought it after some
haggling and hung it under her verandah. It
was gone five minutes later, but it turned up again
In a public-house at some distance, where the

a nail at the end, and retailed it to a simple-
minded man who proudly deposited it on a plite
in the sink. A quarter of an hour later there was
nothing there but the plate. A storekeeper specu-
lated in the fowl shortly afterwards, and planted
it on a high at elf, and when he went to look for it
his remarks were of a chaste and lofty character,
and then the trader made a bee-line for his start-
ing point, and hung the turkey in its old place
under the original verandah. The owner, who
was out hunting for his lost bird, met him as he
was coming away, and wrathfully threatened to
give him into custody, but on his fowl btirg
pointed cut to him he apologised abjectly, and
gave the traduced stranger 5s to say nothing

Ihe paper naively goes on to remark : “There is
much unpleasantness in consequence.” We should
say so. Just think of the sentiments of the young
lady who wears the indlarubber chest-improver
when in the midst of her conquests and pride she
meets the steely glare of that boy; fancy the
anguish of the athletic tennis-playing girl when
that imp heaves in sight: he knows that she is

Consult Planco, a lively youth, now a

most unsober of the crowd he was promptly run
in, but his name and address being given, he was
taken home and served next day with a summons.
He was a larky youth, but not without strategy.
Therefore, he bribed a resident of that suburb,
who gleefully accepted a fiver as remuneration
for appearing to the summons and paying the cus-
tomary 10a fine. But when he was arraigned
before the beak he found that official to be some-
what wrathful. “ Young fellow,” he said, “ there
has been too much of this work down your way
lately. I must teach you a lesson. Three months
hard labour.” We may mention that Harry
Levlen told this yarn to a Campbelltown iury,

dray. Well, in ten days, he had swallowed dray,
bullocks, and all. ((Sensation,) “That’s right,

something to cover them if only leaves and flowers, like

A lady named Sbockwell has climbed on to

fair ladies, and dark ladies, and ladies that are

short, and all other kinds of ladies, down
to the party with hairy moles and a wart on
her nose, are subjected to a strain of temptation
at the FHnders-street terminus strong enough
to upset the equipoise of a brick house. The
whole of the tribulation Is based on the fact that
by dodging into the waiting-rcom taking a sharp
tu n to the left, following a narrow, dark pas
sage, and going up two steps, any lady can
obtain drinks long, short, neat cr mixed, at ordi-
nary rates, in a coty little rcom to which the eye
of man can never penetrate. This, Mrs. Stock*
well argues, is a menace (o society; no woman
ordinarily constituted can resist that sly little
passage, and consequently ladies dark, fair, and
of evary size and make, miss trains slipping in to
arrange their back hair, or bathe their templer,
or put a pin in something, and come out odorous
of square gin and Scotch whisky. We believe,

Dinny McGutnn, who, durirg the governorship of
Lord Belmore, was parish priest at Moss Vale,
New South Wales, and who was present at a
banquet given to H.K. Just as the victual-wolfing
was about to begin the Protestant Bishop rose,
and with great solemnity observed: ‘ ‘ Dear
Friends,—Permit me to say the Protestant grace
on this occasion. For what we are about to
receive may the Lord make ua truly
This pointed reference to the Protestant claim on
the p r ayer so disgusted Father Dinny that he at
once bobbed up, and by way of giving a Holy
Roman flavour to the proceedings staggered
the company by adding : “And may the souls of
the faithful departed, through the mercy of Gcd,
rest in peace. A men.”

At a certain Sydney theatre which wo

tenderness of her passion for the hero, and the
lights were turned down and a weird, thrilling
glamour enchained the audience, suddenly from
the recesses of the d.c.,rose a soft end plaintive

somehow, its melodious sonorosity was a dis-

to have arisen from a dramatis critic.

The Referee
Result of the sixth Australian Eleven
initial match, v. Lillywhite’s team :—Britishers,
first 173, Colonials, first innings, 75;
second, 3€, As events turned out, the Australians
had all the worst of sending their opponents to
the wicket first, a mistake for which the general
public gave Percy M'Donnell all the credit. As
a matter of fact, it was decided by a majority of
the team, and Mac. had no more to do with it
than any other member of the Eleven. M'Don-
nell is anything but the autocrat of the Australian
cricket field.
* * *
Thus the Sydney D.T, : “The English
Eleven fielded like Trogians
* * *
Will Moses go to England ? That is the
'question just now amongst the cricketers.
* * *
When the deaf and dumb-boxer, Mace,
In Newcastle, the other evening, struck a man at
a sparring-entertainment, the police insltted upon
a prosecution, notwithstanding the fact that the
stricken one wanted to let the matter drop. Why
don’t they follow suit in Matheson aad
M'Klhone’s case ?
* ♦ *
Would it not be better to allow the eight-
oar raos to fall through than send from N. S.W.
a crew without the ghost of a show of winning ?
Two of the N.S.W. Selection Committee have re-
signed, and matters just now are mixed.
It is ever thus. A few seasons ago the
two Kennedys and Johnstone would have
gone on bended knee for inclusion in the
Intercolonial team, but, owing to a dearth of
first-class amateur oarsmen in Sydney, they
have, for a season or tw >, scooped the pots in to a
considerable extent, so think they are now quite
justified in sticking the colony up and refusing to
row. Dobson, who has rowed stroke to the three
men named in a couple of winning races, is foolish
to refuse to pull, as he is throwing away a chance
which will never fall to his lot again. So far as
winning the races was concerned, any ordinary
maiden could have won with the Kennedys and
Johnston against the very ordinary crews they
had to meet, and, taken on his individual per-
formances, Dobson would not be picked in a lot of
twenty. men cannot render a satisfactory
reason for thiir refusal, the Association, no
matter how hard pressed for a crew in the future,
should never give the quartette a chance of row-
ing when it suited their oonven’ence.

Mr. Garner, of Melbourne, has made no
mistake in entrusting George Ellis, the well-known
boat builder ard sailor of Balm un, with his order
for a 20-ton crack. The leiden keel, weighing
15] tons, was oast last week, and Ellis’s contract
allows him until August to complete the job.
The Era's successes should make Mr. Garner
jubilant,
* * *
At Foley’s, on Saturday evening next, the
N.S.W. amateur champion pug. will, for the
second time, meet the American Martin Cos-
tello, the most cunning boxer who mounts
Foley's stage, in a six-round encounter.
* * *
Out of the 125 runs made by the Austra-
lians, Sydney men scored 82 against 43 made by
the rest of the Australian contingent.
* * *
lb is just now dawning on the cricketing
public that Percy M‘Donnell is a rather bad
skipper, his poor judgment throwing away many
wickets besides his own. Take, for instance, the
way he went out on Saturday. Fancy a man in
his right senses trying to hit a ball out of the
ground against a southerly gale ! The stroke was
a magnificent one, certainly, but he might as well
have tried to drive it through a deal board.
• * *
George Lohmann says Moses is the grandest
bat In Australia— an d the luckiest,
• * *
Trouble seems to have settled on the house
■of Colley. A few weeks ago “ Brickey,” the well-
known jockey, had his knee smashed eo badly that
it is doubtful if he will ever be himself again. On
last Friday week his nephew, a lad, nine years of
age, was killed through a fall from a horse at
Bathurst, and on the Friday after, the boy's father,
Mr. Anthony Colley, dropped dead, just as he had
finished a dance, at a ball given in the Oddfellows’
Hall. He was a very popular young fellow, and
one of the best rifle shots in the district.

A valued New Zealand correspondent sug-
gests that our sporting readers should not neglect
to have a little bit on the Maorlland filly, Pearl
: Shell, in all her autumn engagements. He says
she ia a regular daisy-cutter, and the best mare
ever bred at Sylvia Park. She had an unbroken
record at Auckland during the spring, and won all
her races with ridiculous ease.
* * *
The latest sensation in the way of sport is
• bicycle-racing for lady-riders only. In due time,
the darlings will take to hurdle-racing at Botany,
and then we may expect to find a few pairs billed
to fight to a finish at Foley’s. When the latter
• consummation comes off, Parliament will be dc-
sorted and our theatres changed into Salvation
Army barracks.

Bookmaker Nat Nathan recently played
very low on the Island Bay (N.Z.) Jockey Club.
He invested £3O on the totalisator on a horse
named Marlborough, and on thab game equine
filing to win, the astute Nathaniel promptly
served the Racing Club with a demand for the
return of his coin. The Club declining, Nat.
served them with a “ Ylotoria-by-the-graoe-of-
God ” and the beak has decided, under some
ordinance of the Charleses or the Georges, that the
bookmaker ia entitled to the £3O, as the demand
was made prior to the money being paid over to
the investor on the winning horse. This apparently
absurd decision is held to be perfectly good law.
and the totalisator In N.Z. 1s doomed unless an
amendment of the Gaming and Lotteries Aot is
obtained. Farnell, M.L.A , should make a note
of this.
* * *
The Australian batsmen In the recent
match made the bowling appear more difficult
than it really was, Turner proving it to them by
the way he played it. Many of them were
deaders before they went in.
# * *
The Bulletin’s prediction re the prob-
able result of the International match was, as it
proved, beside the question, seeing that the
Englishmen batted on a moderately good wicket
compared with that which fell to the home team.
Yet the miserable collapse of the newly-con-
stituted Sixth Eleven must make us pause. During
the present season no local combination has baen
able to score an innings of 300 against Lehmann,
Briggs, and Co,, and their power to keep down
runs on a good pitch is beyond dispute. Now they
have succeeded in taking 20 representative Aus-
tralian wickets for a total of 131 (no “run-outs ”)
It is clear that Turner and Ferris can give them
little start, be the ground as wet as it may—or
else that the Britishers have the pull in fielding
and batting. Unless we can lick the M.C.C. men
at Melbourne, things look unpromising for the
next English tour,

They say that St. Odille, who was one of
the fastest mares in training 18 months ago, la
going in her old form, and will nearly win the
Newmarket Handicap. If she is the St. Odille of
yore nothing can head her for the first half-mile.
She leaves the mark like a shot from a gun.

Midwinter says that the sixth Australian

THE land Is the best ever yet submitted by
subdivision around Melbourne, and it is
admittedly the acme and perfection of the most
fashionable, the healthiest, the most charming,
and the most romantic spot of Toorak, which, it
is needless to say, stands without a rival amongst
the suburbs of Melbourne, The Estate, which is
surrounded by Mansions, has a beautifully pano-
ramic view. For accessibility to the City the
Estate excels all other fashionable rosldentlalsltes.
By road it is about ii miles from the Post-office;
by rail it is considerably less. The Glen Iris Rail-
way branches off from Burnley, and after travel-
ling one mile and three-quarters reaches the Rail-
way Station to be erected on Mr. Fergusons pro-
perty at the Glenferrie-road. This St*tlon is two
minutes' walk from the GREAT TOORAK
ESTATE. By rail the City will be reached from
your breakfast-table comfortably in fifteen
minutes. The Toorak Tram, now in course of
construction, will take you from the heart of the
City to within eight minutes’ walk of the Estate
for Threepence, and the omnibuses from the Tram
Terminus to Malvern pass the Estate. Gas and
water laid on. Drags and Conveyances will meet
Intending purchasers at South Yana Station.

I A torchlight procession was held In honour
f the return from Australia to Canterbury of Mr.
nd Mrs. Hennlker Heaton. Henniker, In his
Beech, said “ that the Colonial Office was very
artunate In having such able men as reprMenta-
Lves of her Majesty In the colonies. At the
iresent moment they had men who were as
■enerous as they were able, and had the
Cleverness not to appear to interfere
msiness." Are you listening, Young Australia ?
A certain Sydney bookseller baa invented
a new method of squaring accounts. From time
to time a lot of very smart people go Into his
large library, and when they think no eye eees
them, they load themselves up (under their coats)
with books—stuff their clothes with them, in
fact. The bookseller catches these people ocoa-
sionally and brings them into his offlM. Then he
pulls down an account-book and puts the matter
thus: “Look here, sirs since last I caught a
book-thief and made him square up, I have lost
by theft- let me see—hum I Yes. Three volnmes
of a full-calf edition of Dickens, the set being
thereby spoilt; a copy of Mudies Felonry; a
couple of old colonial almanacs, worth a good
deal of money, besides a dozen other books, the
whole lot worth, say, £2O. If you now pay me
£2O you can stop out of gaol. If you don 11U cau
a nolioeman." As a rule, the bookseller finds
they pay up, and, says he, “It is much better to
pay £2O than go to gaol—better for mo, bettor for
them, and better for the country.'

Mr. G. W. Garrett, the well-known and popular
sub-editor of the Sporting Life, writeslt gives
me much pleasure to state that, having used St.
Jacobs oil for rheumatism, bruises from football,
as well as for cycling accidents, and after hard
riding, I consider it the most perfect remedy I
have ever used. I can strongly recommend it to
athletes everywhere."
Among the many marvellous cures performed
by St. Jacobs oil which have come under the
observation of Messrs J W. Henley and Co,,
patent medicine vendors at 513 Commercial-road,
London, E., is that of Mr. S. Digby, formerly pro-
prietor of The King's Arms, Stepney Causeway,
now of 31, Brook-street, Ratcliff, who was an
intense sufferer for years with rheumatic gout,
during which time he employed medical men and
tried numerous remedies said to be specifics in the
case indicated, obtaining but little benefit, until
he used St. Jacobs oil, the great conqueror of
pain. A few applications of this marvellous oil
completely and almost instantly removed the pain.
As Mr. Digby expresses it: “One bottle of St,
Jacobs oil did me more good than anything else I
ever tried.”

reasons why they are so difficult to cure.

Dear Bulletin,—You publish in a recent
number of your paper some rather tall mosquito
yarns. Here are a couple of tegular tealsira from
Murray Bank. Perhaps you hate heard them
before, but they’ll stand relating any way, so here
goes. By the way, I may as well premise that
these yams are as true as Gospel, and no “ kid ”
about it. Well, one day when I Was tacking
do vn the Murray in a little dingy with a leg o’-
mutton sail, a whole mob of mosquitoes, just like
a black cloud, came humming through the air,
and banged smabk against thb sail with such
force that they made ft, big hole through it. Next
day, it you please, When I was down on a visit to
Bilberry’s selection, near Kerang township, there
were those mosquitoes fitting in rows along the
top-rail of the wire fence with canvas breeches
on. On another ccoasicn I lost a valuab’e cow.
She seemed to have made tracks for the Golden
Shore and didn’t recur again nohow. Fotir years
elapsed. One day in the remotest Corner of my
selection, up amongst the timber, t found the
skeleton of that cow at the fBot of a boktree, and
looking up, there on the branches sat a big buck
mosquito, picking his teeth with one of the horns.

CATHARTICS.
Many people, and rightly too in many instances,
believe that the nse of cathartics is harmful, and
that if once commenced they must always be
continued. Snob are not the facts, however, so far
as Warner’s safe pills are concerned. They are
very gentle in action, do not gripe, are entirely
vegetable, and can be taken without discomfort,
being sugar- coated. These pills are especially pre-
pars d to act in conjunction with Warner’s safe cure
and other safe remedies, and other pills will not
answer as well. In fact otber cathartics might
entirely neutralise the good effects of the liquid
safe remedies. As scon as Warner's safe cure and
sale pills have removed the waste matter from the
blood, and restored the kidneys and liver to natural
action, nature will supply the needed cathartic,
bile, in sufficient quantity, and the use of the pills
can be discontinued. Unless the bowels move at
least once a day nature should be aided by the safe
pills, as without the constant action of the liver in
a hot climate ill health must soon result. Many
evil effects follow constipation such as piles, head-
ache, giddiness, rush of blood to the head, eta, all
indicating that the blood is being poisoned with
waste matter. Messrs. Warner & Co. have thou-
sands of testimonies from ladies and gentlemen
stating the great good they have derived from the
use of Warner’s safe pills. They are especially
adapted to ladies, and universally used by them.
Be sure and get the genuine which always bear a
picture of an iron safe on the outside of the wrapper.
This caution is not amiss when purchasing any of
Warner’s safe remedies—always look lor the trade-
mark, a picture of an iron safe on the wrapper.
A NOVEL IDEA.
ORIGINATED WITH A MELBOURNE
UNDERTAKER.
A report has been circulated throughout the
city that a combination of Undertakers are to be
formed to put up the price of coffins.
A meeting was held at the City Buffet Catering
Company’s premises last evening with a view of
ascertaining and exchanging ideas as to the beet
method for the advancement of the business Mr.
Melville presided and there was a large atten-
dance.
The chairman briefly referred to the ruinous
depression at present existing, the principal
reasons assigned for same being that of Sir
Henry Parkes' Intention of closing the Devonshire*
street cemetery, coupled with the fact that he has
given his word to our popular Governor that not
another body will be interred, therefore there will
be no more funerals there j but the most im-
portant and paramount reason being the Immense
importations of the famous life-giver, St. Louis
Lagar Beer which, if steps are not taken to sup-
press its importation into these colonies, means
“ the death-blow to our business as Under-
takers.”
The Mariposa was detained in quarantine a few
days simply because there was a single case of
small-pox aboard. This great care taken by the
public health authorities and the wonderful
quality and brilliancy of that far-famed St. Louis
Lager Beer compel us to state emphatically in the
words of Othello “our occupation is gone."
It was also stated at the meeting and from the
very best authority that it is the intention of an
enterprising firm in Melbourne to open an agency
in Sydney and offer prizes to promote its business.
A case of St. Louis Lager Beer, with a coffin—an
extra coffin and a cask of the famous St. Lou*
Lager Beer to anyone getting up a club.
The reporter left hurriedly, saying, “I suppose
your next meeting will take place Ressureotlon
Day.’’

PEOPLE I HAVE MET.
THE GENTLEMAN SUNDOWNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now-a-days, advancing civilization and the
pressure of bad times doing away with the exer-
cise of a too lavish hospitality, have somewhat
closed the door of this particular branch of In-
dustry to well-mannered and indolent young
gentlemen. But some years back It was a well
recognised and tolerably lucrative occupation.
Not exactly lucrative as regards the accumulation
of solid cash, but its exercise furnished a tolerably
easy life, with plenty of change and variety in it,
to those who elected to become members of the
profession.
• * •
In the old days of Queensland it
was usual to ask the well-dressed stranger
at your gate, who arrived at the sunset
hour, to stop and rest the night. If he turned out
to be a well-informed and companionable fellow
he would, if his horses looked tired, be probably in-
vited to remain a day or two, and then, ten
chances to one, the host would find that he had
entertained an angel un-
awares, who had no in-
tention of taking flight
under anything less than
an absolute request to do
so.
* * *
I remember one even-
ing, up North, we were
busy mustering up at
poor Ts. station (T. is
now one of the great
majority), when a travel-
ler put in an appearance.
We had just finished a
long day’s branding and
were all pretty dusty and
tired, and the neat get-
up of the new-oomer
seemed almost like a
studied insult to us in
our begrimed condition.
I, of course, made him
welcome, and at feeding
time we soon found out
that the stranger could
talk fluently on any sub-
ject, and in fact mono-
polised the conversation
and reduced us all to
comparative silence. But
he never made any refer-
ence as to the end or
purpose of his journey,
nor why the district had
been honoured by his pre-
sence. One by one the
tired men went off yawn-
ing to their beds, and
when, a couple of hours
afterwards, I looked out
on the moonlit verandah,
poor T our host,
who, out of politeness,
had remained to the last,
was fast asleep on his
back, and the new arri-
val, smoking his tenth
pipe, was holding forth
on the proper method
of speying cows. Next
morning I was down at
the horse-yard just after
the paddock horses had
been run in, and old
Charley, the stockman,
was drafting out those
that were not wanted.
I saw the two strangers
sent forth with a vici-
ous prod in the ribs
from Charley’s drafting
-stick; and mentioned lb
him that their owner
would probably want
them, to which Charley
replied with scorn, “ He
want them I Don’t I know
those blanked old screws,
why he won’t want them
until the boss kicks him
out. Why he was all
over the Burnett when
1 was there, and I sup-
pose he’s going to give
this place a turn now. j
* • *
As I was going
back to the bon se
met our visitor, wh
immediately drew my at
tention to the magnificent points of the two i
wretched nags which he was evidently pleased to
see had been ejected from the yard. Meanwhile
he indulged in a slightly depreciatory criticism
of the other horses In sight. After breakfast we
were all on the move, intending to oamp out that
night, and as Mr. Trombone (that, he informed us,
was his name), had intimated his intention of not
starting until after lunch, poor T. had nothing
else to do but express a hope that he
would make himself comfortable and say
good bye. “No blanked fear but what he’ll
make himself comfortable,” muttered Charley,
who was getting on his horse close by. It was
dusk before we had yarded the cattle the next
evening, and the first thing we saw as we rede
through the paddock slip-rails were the two
horses of the stranger. We found him up at the
house, clean, radiant, and smiling. We were all
dirty, bad-tempered, and hoarse with shouting :
yet still he tried one man after another with an
invitation to a discussion as to the existence of a
white race in the centre of Africa, but got nothing
but the surliest of responses. The cook was in a
sia.ee of mutiny at having had to serve up meals
in the house during our absence; and Mr. Trom-
bone, after explaining that one of his horses was
very lame, postponed conversation for a better
opportunity. After a week, during which,
although Mr Trombone was constantly ex-
plaining to us his theor of the right way
of working cattle, he nver gave a band
in any way, T. remarked pointedly to him one
morning that “ his horses were in the yard." Now
this was supposed to be the polite way of saying
“ Move on,” and the gentleman sundowner, who
“ acted as sich,” usually took the hint and saddled
up. It was a very hardened case whe required a
second reminder. This was a hardened case—be
merely remarked, 44 Yes, I saw them come in,"
and turned the conversation on to the beauties of
Byron as a poet.
* * •
The next morning T. put It so strongly
that he announced his intention of proceed-
ing, as though his departure would cause
sorrow and tribulation in our hearts, and having
got a pound of tobacco, a new hat, and some
rations out of the store, which he offered to pay
for out of a £2O cheque, which, of course, nobody
could change, he departed to the next station,
where he represented himself as a great friend
of T.’s, at whose place he had spelled a week
on urgent solicitation ! Even in those days there
were strong-minded individuals with narrow
views of life, who had the moral courage to in-
form the weary wayfarer that there was a good
creek two miles further on with capital feed on
it, or, as one well-known resident did when he
was saluted with the introduction of “My
name is De Cooper Jones,” replied, 44 Well, what
the Sheol is it to me if it is V and retired. But,
as a rule, the easy-going pioneers lacked moral
courage, and the G.S. had them at his mercy.
I have known instances where a long, protracted
loaf made the G.S. really consider himself part
and parcel of the station, and almost inclined
to send in a claim for salary. There was a
legend amongst the fraternity that one fortunate
G.S. was giving a station a turn, when an agent
from the Bank arrived to take possession, and
said agent being hastily recalled, and no one else
available, put the G.S., beguiled by his glib
tongue, in charge at a good screw on a twelve
months’ agreement; and on his utter incompetency

being discovered, he was only got rid of by being
paid up in full. But the gentleman sundowner
is almost a thing of the past. What he does for an
honest crust now I know not, but the places that
knew him, know him no more.
DELCOMYN.
Says an Adelaide paper :—“ The Aus-
tralian silver discoveries that are now only begin-
ning, which are in their very infancy, are more
extensive than any that have hitherto been heard
of. All the mines of Mexico, Pern, and California
sink Into mere trifles when they are compared
with these which are known to exist in the Bar-
rier Ranges, on the N.S.W. side of the Australian
border, and at Beltana, and otber places on this
side of that line.
In 1870 Freetrade N.S.W. produced 9J
bushels of malzs per Inhabitant; in 1887 the yield
had dropped to 3| bushels. For the three years,
1865 C-7, she produc’d 45 000 tons of potatoes: for
the three years, 1885-6-7, the return was 38,600
tons only. In 1877 the colony had 3217 acres of
vineyards; in 1887 she had 3131 only. The acre-
age under to>acco decreased from 1791 In 1881 to
1203 in 1887 ; the yield of barley fell from 148,000
bushels in 1870 to 133,000 bushels in 1887 ; and
the acreage under oats from 24,818 in 1883 to
23,947 in 1887. Freetrade is obviously a noble in-
stitution.
In describing the little memorial placed
in St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, by the Soudan
goat-hunters, to the memory of their comrades
who died In, or In consequence of, the Soudan,
Sydney Evening News says : “We are Informed
that the whole of the work was under the super-
vision of Messrs. Hanson and Co. The weight of
the tablet Is said to be 701 b., and it Is very pleas-
ing to find that such good results can be achieved
In the colony without Protection.” Freetrade has
Indeed come to a pass when it is openly proud of
its tombstones.
At Narandera, according to Mr. John
Potts, the Queensland Anti-Chinese delegate, a
white man Is employed in building a house for a
Chinaman at a contract price of £2, He has
been already five weeks over the job, during
which he reckons he will have made 6s. a week.
White men in that district are digging potatoes
for Chinamen at elghteenpence a day. Mr. Potts
sayfl (are you listening, Young Australia ?) that
14 Australian statesmen are too frightened of the
old country to put their foot firmly down on the
Chinese question.”
William Walter Thwaites, an aged Aus-
tralian citlzsn in low circumstances, suicided a
few days ago at Parramatta owing to the Inability
of an official to write a decent letter, and say
straight cut what! he meant. William Walter
was formerly a clerk in the N.S.W. Audit Depart-
ment, but latterly he was making a decent living
at Moss Vale. Possibly, however, he pined for
the old Government stroke ; anyhow, ha wrote to
the Colonial Secretary to ask for an appointment,
and received a reply effusively offering to him and
hia wife a 44 home for the rest of their lives.” Poor
Thwaites did not absolutely look for quail on toast
on the strength of this Invitation, but the pros-
pect seemed good enough to induce him to sell off
his furniture and resign his occupation and come
down to Sydney. Then be found that the 44 home”
in his case meant a cold berth in the Parramatta
Pauper Asylum, while his wife was to be sen
the poorhouse at Newington. The old pair, ho"T
over, declined to bo separated, and when the 11
money gave out, which it did in a few days, W. W.
Thwaites blew his brains out. “ Death through
being left with the key of the street after being
induced to give up his only means of livelihood.”
would have been the rationed verdict, but the
jury put It down as “ temporary Insanity," and
didn’t even add a rider to the effect that Govern
ment officers should try for the future to be less
homicidal In their grammar.
G. M. Reed, of the N.Z Herald (Auck-
land), on Spurgeon s secession from the Baptist
Church
Mr. Spurgeon, in his rigid adherence to the orthodoxy
which commended itself to the purblind searchers of cen-
turies ago, must necessarily believe that the babe that has
lived so long as to open its litt'e blue eyes and smile but
once in sweet and loving recognition, in the tearful face of
its mother, and then to close them in the last still sleep, is
taken away by watching devils and plunged in the blue sul-
phur blazes of a Miltonic hell, there to frizzle and fry and
scream in torture and in conscious and hopeless misery
through the endless, endless, endless ages of damnation.
And why? Not because the tender little cherub sinned
either against its loving mother or its Father in heaven, but
because a naked, filthy lubra, four thousand years ago, took
a bite out of an apple and gave the rest to her husband; and
they lived to be punished for this dread offence in the suffer-
ings of millions of millions of their descendants who, for
this act of disobedience are condemned, all uncon-
scious, and before they were born, to endless ages of woe.
This is orthodoxy, and this is what Rev. r Mr. Spurgeon be-
lieves, and must believe, if he is orthodox; and he believes
that every man that won’t believe it, even if he can't believe
it, will be taken when he dies, and plunged head foremost
into this same horrid lake of fire, and God, and the good
angels, and the brothers, and sisters, and fathers, and
mothers of the lost will look down exultingly from the
battlements of heaven, and rejoice and glory in the sight of
that struggling, writhing, screaming mass of beings rolling
in agony m that blazing sea for ever. This is what Rev. O.
H. Spurgeon believes, must believe if he is orthodox, and it
is to the worship of that fierce, vindictive, and relentless
Being, that causes all this misery as an act of Justice, that
Mr. Spurgeon would invite poor, oateworn, Buffering man.
And it us because ministers of religion do not present God
in this frightful light to men, and horrify the refinement and
gentleness of the nineteenth century by the bloodcurdling
stories that were required to shock and startle, and drive the
brutal creatures of 300 years ago from sin, they fail ia
spiritual life, and thin their churches.
The Orange Lodges of N.S.W. are now
sadly split up on the fiscal question. Abigail,
junior, states that there are many Protectionists
in his lodge and that it is very hard to make them
vote straight.
