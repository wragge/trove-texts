Eileen Duggan
Wondering why it has always been inevi-
table to speak of the poetry rather than
the verse of Eileen Duggan, I found myself
confronted once again with the whole ques-
tion: What is the difference between verse
and poetry? Allow a degree of competence
in each, and what distinction remains?
To begin with some negations. Poetiy
does not depend on the nature of its theme.
It is the mere verse-makers who, having
no inner-harmony, must look about for
“poetical” themes discovered by others. Of
two pieces on the subject of “Dreams” or
“Beauty,” one may be a poem, the other
a mere parcel of adroit verse, depending
for its effect on the atmosphere worked by
the word “Dreams” or “Beauty.” It has
always been my contention that such verse
should pay a heavy royalty for the use of
those august words. Again, it is not length
that makes a poem impressive: an inch of
verse does not become poetry by being
diluted to a yard: indeed, it will lose what
point it had. This seems obvious, yet we
know that a bulky bale of verse, such as one
of Masefield’s weakest long ballads, is often
spoken of as a “great” poem. Then does
verse become poetry if it is musical?
Hardly, unless the music comes from within.
And what have we left as a basis for poetry,
when neither theme nor bulk nor melody
can provide it?
Find a better word for it who can: I set
down the word “intensity” as the mark of a
poet. It is intensity 1 hat can bathe every
theme in a certain magic light; so that the
circle of life lit by poetry is constantly en-
larged. It is intensity that can do without
length, as in a tiny, inspired distich of
Blake’s, which can seem an answer to the
mediaeval proposition, “How many angels
can dance on the point of a needle?” Poetry
when intense enough can also sustain length,
so that, a poem like “Paradise Lost” may
be without weakness or longueurs. As to
melody, it is again intensity that counts.
In a true poem the form and matter, the
song and the thought, are so welded together
that we cannot feel either apart. The form
comes from an inner harmony like that of
the one spirit whose
plastic stress
Moves through the dull, dense world, compelling there
All new creations to the forms they wear.
In the slowly-growing poems of Eileen
Duggan, even in her book published half
a dozen years ago, and still more in what
she has written since then, there is nothing
of the facile verse-maker: there is the inten-
sity of a poet. Her themes are taken from
whatever interests her most. Her poems
have only such length as suits their nature
and unity: each begins and ends with its
own lyrical impulse. Her melody, varied
from poem to poem, comes from within.
Some of us, even those who had read her
book and knew her characteristic tones, were
startled by the grave beauty of this small
lyric, “Faith:
Once on a gallant morning,
With the blue sky blowing- apart,
Each bud broke on my eyelids,
Each bird flew through my heart!
I prayed for the faith of a starling
Under the tawny trees,
A child, or a holy woman—
What could be greater than these?
But .now on a heavy morning,
With the dull sky blowing apart,
When no flower blesses my eyelids
And no wing brushes my heart,
I, made surer by sorrow,
Beg what seems more to me:
The faith of a willow in winter,
Or a blind hound nosing the knee 1
But Eileen Duggan has also a kind of
robustness, even a humor, pervasive and
sustaining. One of the few modern religious
poets, she writes of religion not like a prose-
lyte, with strain and fatigue, but naturally
and warmly, as a man praises his home or
designs a colored window. There is her
poem on St. Peter, with the stanza:
I smile for that old, simple tongue,
So quick, so eager to begin,
That, snubbed and silenced o’er and o’er,
Could never lock its wonder in.
And there is the strange, vivid, ballad of
Quarantana, when the young Christ went
up to the temptation:
But as he passed, the little bees and blossoms
Were still with love and pain.
And every bird bent sideways in its sorrow
And whispered softly to Him as He went,
“My brightness, are You black and lost in anguish?
My sweetness, are You spent?’’
Young Christ came smiling down from Quarantana,
He blessed each bird along the broken lane,
And said, “My little pity, it is over,
My gladness, sing again.”
It seemed necessary to quote part of that
poem here, since I have only seen it in an
American anthology. Eileen Duggan’s work
is known overseas, and in the Irish Home-
stead her book was reviewed by “A.E.”
himself, who wrote:
She shows as much promise in this first book as
any poetess in Ireland has shown. She has entry
to the lovely places of the spirit, .and we hope she
will never because of environment cheapen her talent
or write easier things because they would be more
readily understood.
Eileen Duggan has not cheapened her talent.
She has not written “verse” in meaningless
lengths, like rhetoric/ scattering the wind.
Her few poems are all memorable, which
means that there is no waste, and her work
leaves a surprising impression of bulk.
Meanwhile, we wonder whether her next
and overdue volume will appear overseas or
in Maoriland, her home. Collected in book
form or scattered as it is now, her quiet,
beautiful work makes a touchstone against
which ordinary rhetorical verse can only
shrivel and die.
NETTIE PALMER.
Humor
I thank Bernard Cronin for his valiant
effort to kick back into the arena the ball
of humor which he alleges I have been
partly responsible for kicking out of bounds
(R.P. 14/11/’2B). I am sorry that, as many
another earnest spectator has done, he
merely succeeds in kicking it over his head
into the grandstand.
Briefly, the story so far is: After reading
a few hundred manuscript novels, I sug-
gested that most of them would have been
better for some humor, and added that there
was no good fiction that was without humor.
In reply, Mr. Cronin attacked me on the
second count, and asserted that there is good
fiction, as there are good men, absolutely
without humor, and he quoted “Wuthering
Heights” as an example of good fiction
wanting in what I think is an essential in-
gredient. The “good-men” part of his argu-
ment I will admit: there are good men
who are without humor—good citizens, good
Empire-builders, good plodders, and, good
God, what sort of entertainers! What an
uncritical, illogical parallel! The business
of fiction is to entertain; I think the hun-
griest boarding-house oracle on the quest of
gore will admit that. Mr. Cronin, as his
story “Bracken” will shortly prove to Bul-
letin readers, is a good novelist. I reserve
judgment on him as a debater.
I fancy that he thought hard and earnestly
before he advanced that freak novel
“Wuthering Heights” against- my conten-
tion that all good fiction has humor. He
says that “Wuthering Heights” has no
gleam of humor whatever. I quote from
Charlotte, sister of the author:— ,
There is dry, saturnine hurnor in the delineation
of old Joseph, and some glimpses of grace and gaiety
animate the younger Catherine.
It is not merely for purposes of debate that
I agree with Charlotte Bronte rather than
with Mr. Cronin. And I do not agree with
the implication that “Wuthering Heights,”
as it stands, is as good as it might be. I
am sure it would be all the greater master-
piece for a little more lightness in the
younger Catherine and a little more humor
in the making of Joseph.
But the points of debate that I make here
are, after all, only points. What is more
important is that all this Red Page argu-
ment about humor may lead some of the
more inexperienced of those who are at
work on their entries for the second Bulle-
tin Novel Competition into regarding
humor as the flour instead of the spice of
their fiction cake. I think that would be
a great mistake. I have tried to emphasise
that humor is an essential ingredient of a
novel, but more heavily would I emphasise
that it is an ingredient only. And the word
“humor,” I should also like to suggest, is
not confined to fallabout, custard-pies and
the slapstick. I believe the word embraces
everything that is opposite to serious, a
defining that is supported by the usage of
the phrases “light humor,” “broad humor,”
“dry humor” and so on. Also, I think, by
my pocket Oxford, which translates the
word into “facetiousness, comicality, jocose
imagination,” and by Webster, which puts
it this way:
That quality of the imagination which gives to
ideas an., incongruous or fantastic turn, and tends to
excite laughter or mirth by ludicrous images or
representations; a playful fancy; facetiousness.
Synonyms: Wit, satire, pleasantry.
“Humor,” in fact, is a fine wide word. And
when Australian novelists learn a little
better to play upon their instruments they
will strike the key of it more surely and
more often, and the tune will be great fic-
tion. So far, it is rather a great fiction.
CECIL MANN.
The Bush
The remarks of “Lalage” (R.P.
21/11/’2B) about my “unmitigated scunner
against the bush” are refreshing. I haven’t
come across the word “scunner” for ages,
and it is reminiscent of home and haggis,
not to forget “Auld Lang Syne.”
I can assure “Lalage” that I have no
objection to anybody liking the real wild
bush if he feels that way, but I have an idea,
strongly backed by the population map
(page 865 of the “Federal Year Book”), that
people greatly dislike most of it, and con-
sequently don’t go there. I am more than
willing that they should grow wheat there
and sheep also, but two other maps (pp.

Really and truly I don’t object to the
bush, and certainly not with the hatred
that Lawson put into his verses. I dont
even object to the desert any more than i
do to its brethren in Africa, Arabia and
Rajputana. No desert ever, did me an
injury, nor did I ever ill-use a desert, so
relations are friendly.
Of the white English-speaking nations
of the world I think the two that whoop
up their countries most aggressively are
the Yankees (always) and the Australians
(when the fit is on them). The difference
is that in a sordid worldly sense the
Yankees are the greatest success, and the
Australians, at least since the borrowing
craze came on them in all its intensity,
the most complete failure. Perhiips paint-
ing the desert and patriotically gilding the
dry waterhole may only aggravate the situa-
tion by making the Australian think him-
self richer than he is.

friendly scunner.

Radio v. Gramophone (2nd Round)
With Dr. Keith Barry’s contention that “the
musical taste of to-day is much higher than
it was just after the war” (R.P. 17/10/’2B)
I heartily agree, but he errs when he
asserts that this has been brought about by
the radio. Electrical recording of gramo-
phone records has done more for the appre-
ciation of better-class music generally than
all the radio apparatus ever assembled. As
a means of distributing news items the radio
stands alone, but in fostering a taste for
good music it is still waiting for some
inventive genius to furnish it with a throat
lozenge. On the other hand, the gramo-
phone is no longer a mere musical box.
It is a refined musical instrument.
AHAU.
Our Uncertain Constitution
The Australian Constitution, by W. ■A.
Holman (Printers, Ltd., Sydney), is Banana-
land University’s Macrossan Lecture for
1928. But there is nothing academic about
it; it discusses in the plainest language
events which have made most of this coun-
try’s history during the past 20 years.
Our system of government is liable to be
modified in three ways: (1) By evolu-
tion based on expediency (The change of
national status which gave Commonwealth
and British Prime Ministers co-equal rank,
and which enabled Australia to be repre-
sented directly at the League of Nations,
was really a constitutional change. It
altered the terms of our partnership with
the country whose Parliament was respon-
sible for the Constitution Act); (2) by
referendum; (3) by High Court interpre-
tations.
There has been one negatived referendum
after another, as happens wherever complex
legal questions are put to a popular vote.
When in doubt electors play for safety.
It has been different with the High Court.
In its short history the Commonwealth has
already had two Federal Chief Justices pos-
sessing great force of character, many other
elements of greatness and diametrically
opposite views. Griffith, C.J., was a State-
righter. His interpretations left the national
Parliament with very few powers, and he car-
ried a majority of the Bench with him.
Federal Acts were repeatedly nullified, and
the Federal Arbitration Court was reduced
to impotence. Griffith died, and Knox
took his place. Knox is a Federalist, an
Australian, and has a post-war mind. In a
series of judgments, which even those who
favored the sovereignty of the States had
to admit were unanswerable in law and
logic, he revei’sed most of the decisions
made between 1907 and his appearance on
the Bench. The Engineers’ case over-ruled
determinations which had been accepted
for years as the law of the land, and when
a certificate was applied for to enable the
case to be taken to the Privy Council it
was refused.
The present position of the States, as
summarised by Mr. Holman, is as follows:
(1) They cannot legislate with finality on
any industrial topic; (2) they cannot fix
with any certainty the salaries of their own
servants; (3) they cannot impose any direct
taxes on petrol, newspapers or similar
articles of sale; (4) they cannot (except
by consent of the Federal Parliament)
obtain any revenue from direct taxes
imposed upon their own citizens who are
Federal officers, or from their own citizens
who are holders of Federal stock.
The most dangerous flaw in the existing
system is its uncertainty. Trade and indus-
try may have to readjust all their methods
at any time because of a death on the High
Court Bench. And, in any case, govern-
ment by Judges—which is what our arrange-
ment amounts to—is an anomaly. As Mr.
Holman observes: “The spectacle of _a
community of 6.000,000 people finding their
ultimate authority on industrial matters
not in any Parliament, but in a Court, is
a striking one. So far as my knowledge
goes, no similar state of things can be found
m any part of the civilised world.”
He discusses three choices: (1) Unifica-
tion ; (2) an imitation of the Canadian
model; (3) amendment. Naturally, he
favors the last. Briefly, he would alter
Sec. 92 (and allow any State to say to any-
body, “You must sell your goods at such
and such a price, and under such condi-
tions”); he would insert a provision
enabling the State Parliaments to give their
views on proposed amendments; and he
would provide for a general right of appeal
to the Privy Council on constitutional mat-
ters.

A Satchel of Books
The Ritz Carltons, by Fillmore Hyde
(Methuen). After “fantasy,” there is no
more overworked and abused word in the
language just now than “satire.” According
to the publishers, anything that attacks is
satire; a 200-gun barrage would be super-
satire. Of course, it is ridiculous: satire
must attack, but it must attack indirectly—
it does not telegraph its punches from the
lap. The book is merely clever fiction.
Grammar for Great and Small, by Charles
C. Boyd (George Allen and Unwin). In
an unacademic, almost a racy, style the
author lends a helping hand to him who
would write sentences that the reader can-
not possibly misunderstand. He declares
that if everyone would read “The Kings
English” (Fowler) and Fowler’s “Modern
English Usage” there would be no need for
his' book. He is right; and his work may
serve the useful purpose of leading some
aspiring writers to add those two excellent
volumes to their shelves. Apart from that,
his little book is admirable in itself.
Jipping Street, by Kathleen Woodward
(Longmans). One of those books that even
a reviewer puts down unsatisfied —because
it does not go on. It is an autobiographical
fragment: the childhood in a London slum
of the girl whose mother was a washer-
woman, and who herself helped with the
washing, sang at street corners with a man
who played a harmonium, worked in a fac-
tory, and, with most of her girl acquaint-
ances becoming harlots or unchurched wives,
read and re-read the few books that she could
lay hands on, so educated heyself, broke away
in early womanhood from Jipping-street, and
a little time ago was selected to write
the biography of Queen Mary. Most of her
childhood was spent in basements, with her
mother supporting the sick father and the
five daughters : curiously—perhaps tragically
—these sisters of hers are mentioned only
once in the book, as having been born.
What became of them? The reader goes
through expecting them to crop up again
but they never do. If the natural assump-
tion is also the right one, that haunting, un-
told tale is not the least of the book’s great
qualities. Another remarkable quality is
that the author rarely refers directly to her-
self, but succeeds in keeping herself directly
under the reader’s eye through her associates.
In fact, the autobiography is even more a
biography of her mother: “Wash, wash,
wash; it’s like washing your guts away,”
and sipping her beer in the World On Its
Toes pub, and wiping the brown rim off her
top lip afterwards; of Nell, the barmaid, who
was “like a pawnshop in that she took in
anything”; of Lil, who used to paint her
cheeks by licking the red cover of a diction-
ary and rubbing the red stain on, with a
touch or so of whitewash from the wall if
it was too red ; of a dozen and more bril-
liantly-drawn characters. The book is hand-
somely bound, holds a fine woodcut by John
Nash, and is written with clear simplicity
and obvious sincerity.
Blackie’s Books for the Young. —How long
now have Blaclcie’s been sending forth
annual shiploads of fine, wholesome, vivid
and exciting books for the young? The
firm’s authors included the world’s finest
writers of fiction for youthful taste; not
writers like Milne and those others whose
work is equally, if not more, appreciated
by adults, but authors like Angela Brazil.
G. A. Henty and Percy Westerman, who are
peculiarly loved by adolescence and those
who dwell about its boundaries. Blackie’s
output this year is as good and as varied as
evert It includes the following fine school
and adventure stories: For Boys —“ln the
Hands of the Malays,” “Sturdy and Strong”
(ships and things), “Through Three Cam-
paigns” (Arabs and others), by G. A.
Henty; “A Lad of Grit” (pirates and smug-

THE GREAT ILLUSION.
W. J. Mcßride, the Australian who has
world-wide fame in the metallurgy of zinc
and lead, has been telling his homeland
about the progress which other countries
are making. In Germany, for example,
“expert and efficient” operatives in the
metal industries are working up to 12 hours
a day for 6d. an hour, and—much more im-
portant—the pay is “proportionate to the
cost of living.” Against the products of
such labor no doubt we might protect our-
selves at home by a Customs tariff of
200 or 300 per cent.; but how are we going
to compete abroad with countries that have
“expert and efficient”. labor at sixpence an
hour? And we must export because we
will import, and even if we didn’t we have
a tremendous foreign interest bill to meet.
* * * *
Bret Harte’s Californian workers dreaded
Chinese cheap labor, but our menace
is dear labor. Take the case of those young
citizens who are given an agricultural train-
ing at such institutions as the Burnside
Homes, outside Sydney. A boy from these
schools goes to a farmer at 16, and is accept-
able till he reaches 19, when he becomes
entitled under the Arbitration law to a
much higher wage. The farmer, whose
wheat is worth only what it will bring in
a foreign market, where it meets the com-
petition of labor that costs 6d. an hour,
simply cannot afford to pay this higher
wage, so the youth is sent back to the city,
and there the fact that he has specialised
in agriculture is a positive handicap. In
other days this type of loose-end worker
might have made good in domestic ser-
vice. But union effort has raised the pay
of waiters, valets, chauffeurs, gardeners and
the like to figures which can only be paid
by hotels and the rich. The response qf
most of those who once employed male as
well as female domestics has been to give
up living in houses with gardens and settle
in flats with labor-saving devices. The
latter are gradually exterminating not only
domestics of both sexes but subsi-
diaries, such as icemen. And the only
beneficiaries are a handful of people who
have the luck to be in work on the Arbi-
tration scale of wages, and a growing army
of foreign manufacturers and patentees on
whose devices the award-created shortage
of domestics has the same effect as a Pro-
tective tariff.
The destruction of perfectly good jobs
by the fixation of wages at an inflated
figure is going on all over the Common-
wealth and in all callings. At Malvern
(Vic.) last week a baker was fined for not
paying his “improver,” aged 16, £5 10s. a
week, which means, of course, that
that improver will be sacked. Thus
it is adding steadily to the armies
of unemployed with which all the
States are hampered. Even those who get
jobs and keep them are not nearly so well
off as they seem to be. The last report
of the N. S. Wales Railway Commissioners
contained this reference to the Sydney
trams:—
“Although there were substantial increases
in working expenses, due to Court awards,
shorter hours, family endowment, 44-hour
week, etc., they were more than offset by
the increase in revenue.”
The workers in other industries provided
the increased revenue, and they did it by
paying exorbitantly for their transport. It
costs from three to four times as much to
get about Sydney as it does to get about
London. Sydney’s civic electricity venture
is paying 50 per cent, more for much of its
work than it should—and prices are to be
raised against consumers. This will mean
that those who can will raise their prices
against the public. In order to administer
all these involved matters more and more
civil servants have to be engaged (the N. S.
Wales Premier mentioned in his Budget
speech that 2497 new officials had been
created in the last five years, with an in-
creased salary list of £1,059,748), and the
workers in work are paying for them.
* * *■ «
If Labor leaders and union secretaries
met and evolved a policy which included a
drive in the interests of increased produc-
tion, an abandonment of the rush for illu-
sory spoil in the form of higher wages, and
a banning of strikes, which last year lost
the workers of Australia 1,713,581 days'
pay, all classes would benefit. The aristo-
cracy of the proletariat would not have
half their wages confiscated in taxation
direct and indirect, seen and unseen, for
the purpose of paying for .wage-inflation
and its effects in other industries, and most
of the unemployed who are not unemploy-
ables would get work. But such a pro-
gramme is not dramatic enough for func-
tionaries who, like jungle witch-doctors, live
by convincing their congregations that they
can not only call the spirits of affluence and
leisure from the industrial deep, but make
them come.
SHALL IT BE A CROOKS’ PARTY?
There has been an unsuccessful appeal to
the High Court in the case of Silas Young
Maling, acting-general manager of Sydney’s
municipal electricity department when
Labor aldermen ran the Town Haul.
Maling was dismissed by the City Com-
missioners after a Royal Commissioner,
Harvey, J., had declared him guilty of tak-
ing a “present” of £10,600 from tenderers
for a power-raising plant, and sharing the
spoil with Labor aldermen; and a stipen-
diary magistrate ordered him to pay a fine
of £5OO and serve six months’ imprisonment.
The conviction was obtained under State
law, and it was argued on Maijng’s behalf
that the State had no jurisdiction, the im-
porting of materials for the plant making
a Commonwealth matter of the transaction
adjudged corrupt. Five High Court Judges
flattened out this contention, with costs.
An appeal to Quarter Sessions on other
points has still to be heard.
* s(: ❖
Meanwhile another Royal Commissioner,
Thomson, J., has reported on the City
Council’s coal transactions with a concern
called Byrnes, Ltd., which had the field to
itself for many years. R. Woof, sometime
superintendent of the city powerhouse, con-
fessed to the regular receipt of bribes for
a number of years from W. J. Johnston,
an employee of Byrnes, Ltd., and that per-
son (now dead) admitted having paid'them.
Johnston also swore that in 1920, when the
Labor aldermen gave Byrnes, Ltd., a three-
years’ renewal of its contract, against the
recommendation of general-manager Mac-
kay, he weighed in with £l5OO for Maling,
Woof and (as Maling put it) “the gang
down below.” The Commissioner believes
Johnston’s evidence, and says that if the
directors of Byrnes, Ltd., did not know
what was going on they should have known.
The Royal Commissioner also accepts sworn
statements to the effect that bribes were
paid by Nicol, Peacock and Co., Kirton
and Earnshaw and the South Clifton Co.,
and describes Woof’s version of the South
Clifton transaction—among other things the
gentleman said he “got £5OO for distribution
to aldermen, which was handed over to
Holdsworth in the presence of Stokes,
then Lord Mayor”—as “very convincing.”
Holdsworth, who was Labor M.L.A. as
well as alderman, as also was Stokes,
struck the Commissioner as “an evasive and
unreliable witness, and unworthy of cre-
dence.” This is mentioned apropos of evi-
dence that a corrupt proposal was made to
and refused by the Northern Collieries
Agency— “Holdsworth said he wanted 2s.
a ton to influence the acceptance of the
tender, and that £5OO was to be paid down.”
Ex-Alderman English also “impressed me
as a witness who, on matters affecting his
own actions and conduct, was quite un-
trustworthy,” though the transaction in
which English’s name was mentioned, along
with that of ex-Lord Mayor Mostyn, did
not go through.
What are ex-Premier Lang and the A.L.P.
executive going to do about these stagger-
ing judicial reports? So far, they have pre-
served a silence like that of the tomb,
though Stokes was a member of the second
Lang Ministry, and every Labor alderman
was “endorsed” by the executive. It is
several months since Justice Harvey ex-
pressed himself as satisfied that out of the
£10,600 £7500 or £BOOO had been paid by
Maling to Labor-Alderman Green for
division with other aldermen, and that
Holdsworth had asked for a separate
“cut”; but neither Holdsworth nor Green
has been brought to book. Yet Labor
men whose probity is above suspicion
(Senator Gardiner, for instance) have been
flung out of the party for refusing to be
puppets of Lang and the bosses, and both
ex-Premier and executive have boasted
mightily that they have thereby “cleaned
up the movement.”
THINGS THEY DO IN ENGLAND NOW.
It has been a convention many
Britons—particularly of the Little England
school—to be supercilious about the
Dominions, Max Beerbohm won applause
with “The only emotion with which the
mention of Australia inspires me is a deter-
mination never to visit it,” and G. B. Shaw
got a laugh the other day when he wrote
to an acquaintance in Australia and asked
where Tasmania was, adding that “he knew
it was on the earth somewhere.” A well-
known novelist of the younger school who
was here last year objected to the domes-
tics of Australia, and Dame Margaret
Greville, who followed him, to their em-
ployers. The Diggers, it was agreed in
England during the war, might be all right
as shock troops, but they were incapable
of learning the finer points of peace-soldier-
ing, which is an affair of manners rather
than of morale. Similarly, some of our
cricketers have been accused of failing to
measure up to the British amateur standard.
It is not a question of making money out
of the game (scores of amateurs admittedly
do that in the U.K., and have done it ever
since the days of Dr. W. G. Grace), but of
following unsuitable occupations. The true
Briton has always felt strongly about
offenders against his canons of behavior,
whether social, sporting or ethical, and he
has never hesitated to express his dis-
pleasure where it has been aroused; it is
one of the reasons why foreigners fail to
appreciate his many merit®.
* * * *
Bearing these facts in mind, it is soothing
to reflect on how much blacker the position
might be. Australia has a large number
of Judges who have either retired or are
on the point of doing so. Our Judges are
underpaid while on the bench, and, if they
are Federal Judges, they get no pensions on
retirement. Our clergymen of all denomi-
nations are also underpaid, as a rule. Sup-
pose they and the Judges took to sensa-
tional or society journalism as a means of
increasing their inadequate incomes, ex-
plaining that the end justified the means
since their families were large and expen-
sive. N.S.W.’s ex-Divorce Judge Gordon,
for example, would be in great demand as a
writer of destructive legal articles (the
arguments being supported by references
to cases which had come before him), or
of spicy gossip paragraphs about the not-
ables he had met. Australia has some
admirable clergymen-writers. Suppose the
best of them abandoned their ill-paid essays
on spiritual subjects, and struck out as
pungent critics of social and political dis-
orders. The type of Briton who deplores
our politics, strikes, clothes, accents, un-
soldierliness (when not soldiering) and
crude disregard of ancient convention would
be scandalised, and his reproofs would be
devastating.
Or, rather, he would have been shocked
and condemnatory a few years ago. Nowa-
days, it is England that is doing things
which are “not done” in Australia. Such
leading society journalists of Britain as Vis-
count Castlerosse, Lady Eleanor Smith and
the Marquis of Donegal are in the business
largely because they have secrets to give
away to the millions who wish to pry into
the private lives and characters of members
of the aristocracy. The latter resent some
of these disclosures—Viscount Castlerosse
has said so more than once—but the pen-
wielding members of the nobility and
gentry are unperturbed. Dean Inge, who
holds one of the most lucrative ecclesiastical
jobs in the kingdom, draws £5OOO a year
from an evening paper for articles which
are only acceptable to his employer in so far
as they are provocative—to Australians, to
foreigners, to the working classes and many
others. Lord Birkenhead is an ex-Lord
Chancellor, one who has been “the Keeper
of the King’s Conscience,” and he is en-
titled still to sit on two of the highest
tribunals in the world—the judicial com-
mittee of the Lords, which hears U.K.
appeals, and of the Privy Council, which
hears appeals from all over the Empire.
He has begun his career on a new London
weekly with an article on “the evergreen
subject of* oppressive divorce laws.” Every
weapon in the armory of guff is there, from
the florid headpiece of the writer in his
judicial robes to the tailpiece of a stricken
female wandering brokenly from the judg-
ment seat, short-skirted, cloche-hatted, and
alone.
* * *
Suppose Chief-Justice Knox stepped down
from the High Court bench to do a series
of exposures of the crooks of Australian
racing, or any of the other problems on
which he is able to speak as an expert.
He would be within his constitutional rights,
and the paper which published his writings
would get the scoop of a lifetime. But
what is the use of speculating about the
unthinkable? It is only in modern Eng and,
the place where phrases like “good form,”
“play the game” and “it’s not cricket were
born, that such outrages on decency can
happen.
A LADY IN SEARCH OF AN
ALPHABET.
A correspondent who gave the impression
of being feminine, and also very probably
young and beautiful, aired a legitimate
grievance recently. She had commenced
her career as typist and secretary in the
employ of a literary man who was par-
ticular about the orthodox orthography.
Therefore she spelled “honour” with a “u”
and “harmonize” with a “z” and “judge-
ment” with an “e” in the middle, and
“catalogue” with nine letters instead of the
Yankee seven. And when she moved to
the service of a bustling business firm, she
was told to drop these old-fashioned notions,
and had to learn her own language all over
again. As a result, she began to doubt
whether she had a language. If she had
devoted her life to the study of the Funk
and Wagnalls Dictionary, published in New
York and extending to 2956 pages, her
doubts might have been aggravated, for
that tome supplies alternative spellings for
as many words as possible and is very suc-
cessful on the job. As for pronunciations,
it even gives two noises for “Smith,”
though I can’t tell the difference. One has
a sort of accentuation over the “t” while
the other concentrates more on the “i.” And
there are two varieties of “Thomas,” two
of “James” and two of “butter.” Know-
ledge is always valuable and I like to have
a little of it about, but it may become in-
digestible.
Complaint is made that the language is
being “barbarised” (or “barbarized”). It
might not be amiss to carry the barbariz-
ation a little further by appointing an all-
British council of men bursting with facts
to decide which is the right dictionary and
which is the best kind of phonetic alphabet
—one which will take in all known British
sounds and some essential ones which are
non-British. If any person could tell with
almost unfailing accuracy how a word is
spelled by the sound of it and how it is
pronounced by the look of it, life would
be easier.
The old alphabet would, of course, be
preserved for a long time, first as a literary
necessity ami afterwards as a literary luxury,
even though business was conducted and
books, newspapers and magazines were
printed in the new one. It would be remi-
niscent of old days when England had a
variety of spoken and -written languages,
but not printed ones, for the time was not
then ripe. The old baron and his military
following used French, and some of them
had Latin for a side-line. The language
spread widely, especially in London, among
the commercial class, which supplied the
great man with goods and sent him bills.
He had no desire to communicate directly
with the masses who spoke Middle English,
were mostly serfs, and didn’t go to battle.
Any heated remarks he desired to make to
them might be conveyed per middleman.
But when Welsh longbowmen and other
strange types became essential parts of an
English army the baron was dragged almost
unconsciously out of his seclusion. He began
to unbend and mix in general conversation.
In fact, so many talked London English
and forgot the language of their ancestors
that the last of their faithful followers in
the Anglo-French provinces said they had
become incomprehensible, and bade our
ancestral peerage keep to its acquired island
and gibber there.
This shows that the introduction of a
new and improved language into England
didn’t make for permanent disruption, but
in the long run for greater unity. The intro-
duction of a new and improved alphabet
into the British-speaking world, including
Australia, should have the same effect.
J.E.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Square Deal for the Little Chap.
One of the axioms of politics that dates
back to the beginnings of representative
government is that in administering justice
and making laws the balance should always
be tipped in favor of the little man. Of
course you can tip it too far and upset the
apple-cart, as Lang in N. S. Wales, Theo-
dore in Bananaland and Hogan in Victoria
have discovered, and damage the small
people considerably in the resultant smash.
But the principle remains a good one.
Unfortunately the scales of justice in this
continent seem to be weighted pretty often
in favor of the rich. Income-tax evaders
on the grand scale go free, while lesser
offenders are severely punished. The orgy
of bribe-taking and corruption that has
swept the senior State in recent years has
made many men wealthy. Their guilt is
known, but not one of them is in gaol.
One who was sentenced to imprisonment
many weeks ago remains at large while
expensive processes of law are explored to
provide him with opportunities of appeal.
There are many very rich men in Australia
who have given no useful service to the
nation. The disparity between the incomes of
such people and those of decent hard-
working men and women is a cause of social
irritation. These are a few of the reasons


why Labor, with all its handicaps, polls so
well. , , „
Nationalism holds the Federal Govern-
ment merely because Labor is infested by
red ticks and pink fleas, parasites that it
may or may not be able to scratch on. But
unless something is done to convince the
mass of the population that wealth doesn t
count for anything in the eye of the Law,
the day may come when the ticks and the
fleas will rule Australia.
Rural Schools and Rural Conditions.
The draw of the city in Australia is due
to many causes, among them our educa-
tional system. The conditions in town and
country are so fundamentally different that
it is unreasonable to expect the same
methods to apply with equal success to
both. The present curriculum is arranged
to suit the town child, with the result that
the country child is given a twist in the
same direction.
There is no country in the world where
the rank and file of the farming community
are so scientifically trained as in Denmark;
there even the farmhands have usually
passed through the agricultural colleges, and
the small country’s success in primary pro-
duction is largely due to this fact. At the
same time, since 1739, when compulsory
free education was first introduced into Den-
mark, the danger of drawing the children
away from the soil has been recognised and
guarded against. The present law provides
that the pupils must be taught 18 hours per
week, but the local school board, on which
the farming interests are represented, allot
these hours to suit local requirements. The
children may have three hours each day,
but more commonly they attend for six
hours every other day; sometimes the elder
ones attend for four days during the winter
and two during the summer, and the youn-
ger children vice versa. On the off-days
they are free to help their parents in the
practical work of the farm, and so acquire
useful knowledge and often an early bias
towards agricultural pursuits. Tuition in
the schools is limited to elementary sub-
jects, but no pupil can leave at 14 until he
has learnt to express himself creditably both
orally and in writing, which is a far better
mental training than cramming the child-
ren with a medley of facts. Backward
scholars are kept at school for another year
or more.
Under this system it is found that the
rural children retain their country interests,
and thersi are more applicants for land and
farm work in Denmark than the area can
support. It is proved also that the shorter
school hours are sufficient to equip them
with the necessary grounding for higher
education. The People’s High Schools pro-
vide free evening instruction, principally
during the winter months, and are volun-
tarily attended by pupils after leaving
school; and at the age of 18, after several
years’ practical experience, the rural worker,
be he landowner or hired man, is free to
study the applied sciences at the agricul-
tural colleges. But it is insisted that a
practical training comes first.
We.are frequently informed that our edu-
cational system is a model to the world at
large. It looks like a complacency due to
insular ignorance.
The Beast in the Car.
The papers that report rape cases in detail
are having the time of their lives. Out-
rages startling in number and ferocity have
come to light within the past few months.
There have been few arrests, and fewer
convictions; it is notoriously hard to get a
conviction in these cases. If alibis are
inadmissible it can always be alleged that
the woman was a wanton, and willing. Pal-
pable ruffians have successfully pleaded
that the girl was a consenting party to pro-
ceedings that would sicken a savage.
Alarming as the known facts are, for
every case on record probably three or four
are kept dark. Fathers or husbands will
not let the victims undergo the agony and
shame of a public avowal when the prospect
of the guilty being punished is so poor.
Even if the girl escapes the mud-throwing
barrister she cannot escape the gloating
gutter-rag. Nor are the police exempt
from blame for this reluctance to enlist their
aid. In broad daylight not long ago a
Sydney factory-girl, on her way home from
work, was attacked by a beast in a motor-
car from whom she had thoughtlessly
accepted a lift —apparently most of these
fiends hunt in cars —and left unconscious
in the bush. While she was hovering be-
tween life and death the police offered a
reward for information that would lead to
an arrest —and disclosed the unhappy girl’s
name. One of its printed announcements,
with the name in bold type, was posted up
at the Central Station, where scores of
thousands of people must have seen it.
Incidentally, the S. Aus. Parliament has
decided that gloating gutter-rags are de-
generate and a cause of degeneracy in
others. Reports of rape cases —in fact, all
cases involving “immorality, vice or in-
decency”—are to be drastically restricted
in the Central State. They must not exceed
50 lines of space, portraits included. The
penalty for a first offence may be a fine of
£250; for a second offence £SOO or six
months’ imprisonment, or both.
British versus American Methods.
A test of what the British public thinks
about Prohibition will be applied if, as fore-
casted in London, the doctrine is financed
in 40 constituencies at the coming general
election.
“The trade” in the U.K. represents over
£300,000,000 of invested capital, and is spoken
for in Parliament by no less than 15 Peers
and 50 Commoners. Yet year by year
legislation is passed which has the effect of
increasing the price of liquor, guaranteeing
its quality and diminishing the hours during
which it may be consumed. Under the Scot-
tish Temperance Act any of the electorates
north of the Tweed can have Prohibition for
three years on a 55 per cent, majority, and
a few have made the experiment. The
Liquor (Popular Control) Bill, which is
sponsored by the Bishop of Liverpool, alms
at introducing a similar system into Eng-
land; its chief object is “to give to the
people in any area the right and responsi-
bility of deciding by their votes the extent
and' method of the sale of intoxicants in
their area.”
But there are stronger forces at work
than any that could be forged by Parlia-
ment —educational and social forces. In
England the elderly drunk is becoming an
outcast in all grades of society, and the
youthful drunk is practically never seen;
the stage inebriate is out of date, and
Punch has stopped publishing jokes about
drunks. Scotland has managed even to eli-
minate the closing-time drunk to a great
extent; because of its Time Limit legis-
lation publicans dread being found with a
drunk on or near the premises, since hotel
licenses are only granted by the year. New
Yorkers have to come to London now for
an object-lesson in sobriety, as well as for
liquor which can be relied on not to cause
sudden death, and for this change in what
used to be one of the world’s most drunken
cities emancipated women and democratic
churches are largely responsible. It is the
slow evolutionary British way as opposed
to the sudden methods of a nation which
produces more patent nostrums than any
other three countries in the world.
♦
Schools, Hospitals and Cockspurs.
The shelters furnished for those who have
the triple misfortune to be old, infirm and
poor in N. S. Wales are being described as
a disgrace to civilisation. The hospitals are
said to be shamefully insufficient and run-
ning short of nurses because it is difficult to
find trainees who will face long hours, exces-
sive work and sleeping'anything up to six in
a room. And it is officially announced that
last year 38,741 children were getting
compulsory education amid shocking sur-
roundings. The plea is advanced that the
pawning of Posterity even harder than usual
to remedy these defects is justified by the
urgency of the situation.
But while one lot of Ministers wail for
more loans and more expenditure, another
lot wail that so much has to be paid for
past unproductive loans that they are afraid
the old people must put up with their
misery, and the youngsters with their dis-
graceful overcrowding. A possible cause of
this is the craze for building branch, cock-
spur and dead-end railways on credit.
Face a few facts. It costs a ridiculous
price to raise loan money now. It costs
far more than it used to do to build a
mile of line? and to work it when it is
built. The area under cultivation was
160,000 acres less in 1927 than in 1917,
though the total railway was 1313 miles
more. The system has become unpayable
to an alarming extent. And the more
the country is nominally opened up by loan
railways, the more the One Big City pre-
dominates.
The Government is devising means to
raise the best part of a million more
revenue; yet neither the Minister of
Health nor his brother of Education appears
to benefit in the least. The ill-judged loan-
railway business seems capable of swallowing
the lot.

The Two Old Men of the Sea.
Reading about this tiresome and apparently
interminable Walsh-Johanson struggle for
the control of the Seamen’s Union, reading
it in the papers from day to day, week to
week, month to month, one might be
tempted to wonder if Australian seamen
ever have time to go to sea. Even if a
certain proportion must be afloat, appa-
rently there are hundreds left in every State
capital to hold meetings and pass resolu-
tions and exhibit every sort of noisy parti-
sanship with one of these two calamitous
persons.
If Bruce had only succeeded in having
the two irreconcilables deported after their
immurement on Garden Island, what a
benefactor he would have been to the Sea-
men’s Union, in the light of the last two
years’ events! The union can’t deport
Walsh and Johanson, but it might get rid
of both by definitely warning them off its
premises. Until it does so, it doesn’t look
as if it had much chance of getting on with
its job, which, after all, is seafaring, or of
presenting a united front to shipowners,
or of making itself a strong industrial organ-
isation, or even of accumulating a respect-
able bank balance.
Sindbad was, after all, more fortunate:
he had only to carry one Old Man of the
Sea.

New Times in New Guinea.
Dear Bulletin, —When civil administration
succeeded military occupation in German
New Guinea one soldier took over from
another; and for the first years there was
very little perceptible change. Uniforms
were grudgingly cast aside, and the same
captains and lieutenants “carried on” as
plain “misters.” The Expropriation Board,
the cumbersome Government machine that
took over and controlled all unofficial Ger-
man interests in the Islands, was merely a
collection of Diggers with little interest
in the ultimate welfare of the country, and
trying hard to get back into civvy life.
Private individuals and interests in those
early years were practically negligible.
Development work was at a standstill. The
needs of the Mandates Commission were
catered for in a voluminous report, and the
League of Peace’s questionnaire was
answered in detail with appendix after
appendix. The natives were happy; the
whites were apathetic.
Finances were the only thing that wor-
ried the new Administrator to any extent.
During the German Administration a sub-
sidy was received annually from the Father-
land to cover the current deficit; but such
a system was no good to Australia, so
increased taxation solved the question in a
most efficient manner. Nobody raised any
particular objection. The fact that the
export duty on copra during the German
time was 10 marks a ton and had been
raised to 25 shillings was a mere detail.
The Expropriation Board was the chief,
almost sole, exporter of copra, so why
worry?
However, that idyllic state could not last
for ever, and the Expropriation Board dis-
posed of the German properties. That
brings us down to the present day. The
board has faded, and in its place are a
hundred and one private interests that
clamor for rights of citizenship, reduced
taxation and recognition of the fact that
it is the planter who is mainly responsible
for a nice little surplus in the Administrative
balance-sheet.
The present and the immediate future
will be a test for the Administration. The
days of inactivity are past, and those com-
panies and individuals who have acquired
the old expropriated estates for some three
and a half million pounds will Hemand con-
sideration as well as the Permanent Man-
dates Commission. It’s not going to be all
beer and skittles. —Yours, Mandateite.

With the Empire glooming over the con-
tinued sickness of the King, it is interesting
to note the plea of the English press that
the monarch should follow the example oi
Queen Victoria and get into the habit of
putting in some of the English winter in
the milder climate of the French Riviera.
Why not go a step further, and, with an
eye to Empire-building, return to Australia,
which he has visited twice before? There
is no doubt that he is a sick man where his
lungs are concerned, and pneumonia is
a serious threat as the years mount up. A
six months’ stay on the Australian table-
lands should make a new man of the over-
worked Sovereign. With a Regent appointed
to take his place—as has been done a dozen
times before in the Sovereign’s absence from
the Kingdom—he could come here and re-
main here for the healing which he needs.

‘TJbique”: A Bulletin writer thinks Papua
wants more advertisement. Surely the
assaults by natives on little white girls and
women (including nurses), the murder of
Andy Doyle 15 miles from Port Moresby
and the pardon of the native murderer on
the eve of his execution (this through mis-
sionary influence), the killing of native car-
riers handcuffed to chains while carrying
Government supplies, and the Delta mas-
sacres are sufficient to advertise us. A
Royal Commission would furnish details
that are not in the reports forwarded from
time to time to Home and Territories by
a very humble and obedient Government
Secretary.
TIME’S REVENGES.
“Much of the wheat exported from South Australia and Victoria will be lifted by sailing ships, of which more will be seen in Australian waters than for many years."
HANS (to Ole): “Goot pioke, Yake Yohanson. He make shteamers opsolete.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Nationalist Governments in N. S. Wales
and South Aus. —and the Federal National-
ists lost in those States. Labor Govern-
ments in Queensland, Westralia and Victoria
—and F'ederal Labor was beaten in all three.
It generally happens that way when one
party or the other has been predominant in
State politics for any length of time. Queens-
land Labor lias been in office since June,
1915, yet every subsequent Commonwealth
general election —and there have been five —
has seen it horribly licked.
Nineteen twenty-five was Federal Labor’s
black year, and it has naturally done better
this time ; but it has not equalled its very
ordinary achievement in 1922. At that elec-
tion—quite a normal affair —it won 29 seats
in the House of Reps., a gain of four, and
11 in the Senate, all gains. This time it has
won 31 seats in the Reps., a gain of eight,
and seven in the Senate, a loss of four. But
it would have had no hope in one of the
captured electorates if the old member hadn’t
been too late with his nomination-paper; and
in three others its majorities were less than
130. And it would have lost another Senate
seat if one of the Vic. Nationalist candidates
hadn’t died.
A month ago Ley
(Barton), Manning
(Macquarie) and Dun-
can-Hughes (Booth-
by) were thought to
be in the running for
the vacancy in the
Bruce-Page Cabinet.
Now all three are "de-
feated members, and
Gullett has taken the
late Herbert Pratten’s
place, while Abbott
(Gwydir) and Tas.
Senator Ogden are
also in the Ministry,
Bill Hill (Echuca)
and, Queensland Sena-
tor Crawford having
obligingly made way
for them. It was
tough luck for Duncan-
Hughes to be beaten
by a mere 88 votes in
a poll of 41,498, espe-
cially as the Butler
taxes were to blame.
He will come again.
Duncan-Hughes.
The N.S.W. Leg. Council has made a
wreck of the Bavinshaw Government’s in-
come-tax, but some of its “amendments” are
worse than the original proposals. Even
Bavin and Stevens were willing to let tax-
payers who have had sickness in the house
deduct their medical and hospital bills where
the taxable income is less than £6OO p.a., but
reactionaries got the limit reduced to £4OO
p.a. The same crowd fell on the attempt
to make single men in the £250-£3OO group
pay a trifle, Carruthers saying “it would be
a recruiting-sergeant for the Labor party,’’
whatever that may mean. “Nationalists”
of the Carrutliers type never weary of fawn-
ing on Labor people, who only laugh at them,
and smiting the middle class, from which
they get their votes.
Vic. Premier McPherson struck difficulties
early. What he most wanted was seven
months’ supply so that he could close up
Parliament for half a year and think out
a policy. But the National party numbers
19, whereas the defeated Hogan had a fol-
lowing of 28, and the new man depends even
more than the old one on the support of
skirmishers and disagreeable friends. He
had to be content with a month’s supply, so
he will have to think in a hurry.
Persistent Fritz is to the fore with a new
suggestion—that he should pay reparations,
not as per agreement, but “on the strict basis
of the country’s capacity to pay, due regard
being given to the right of the German people
to maintain an adequate standard of living.”
Apparently Fritz would fix his capacity to
pay and pay accordingly. There is no rush
to do business.
In Maori land, where United-party leader
Joseph Ward badly wants to come in, while
Premier Joseph Coates callously neglects to
go out, the new House is divided into six
sections, or at least there arc six labels. The
hindrance to any compromise between the
two principal crowds is that Joseph Coates
has a tendency towards a mild form of
economy, while Joseph Ward wants to per-
form in the London money market like a bull
of Bashan. Besides, the two parties aren’t
on speaking terms. But if Labor, which
ranks third, is willing to make a deal, and
the Upper House doesn’t get in the road,
louseph Ward’s £70,000,000 loan idea may
get a trial. It will be a splendid experiment
to watch from a distance.
Dr. Argyle.
Public life, strenu-
ous as it is nowadays,
seems to agree with
Dr. Argyle, though he
entered it compara-
tively late—he was in
his 53rd year when
Toorak sent him to
the Yic. Assembly
eight years ago. He
was Lawson’s Chief
Sec. and Minister of
Health in 1923-24, and
Allan’s from Nov., ’24,
to May, ’27; now he
holds the same offices
under McPhairson.
Kyneton clainls him as
a son, and the Digger
as a brother—he was
in Lemnos and France
as a lieut.-col. in the
A.A.M.C.
There are fore-
shadowings of a vigor-
ous effort to remove
Scullin from the Fed-
eral Labor leadership
and replace him with
Theodore. It is the lot of the ordinary Labor
leader to live in an atmosphere of suspicion,
always with the idea that his best friend is
round the corner sharpening a knife with
which to cut his throat. When Lang
sacked his Labor Cabinet, he had no
difficulty in finding members ready to wolf
the vacant portfolios, and his case was only
a little worse than the average. Theodore
has no particular record, but has a capacity
for looking as if he had done something, or
was just going to do something. So his face
is half his fortune, the other half being in-
vested in good securities.
The. Diggers’ League, which has been con-
ferencing in Sydney, for the thirteenth year,
talked straight to the Bruce-Pages about
their slackness on such subjects as defence
and Protective measures against dumping. W.
P. J. McCann, a South Aus. delegate, gave
the Government beans for starving the
C.M.F., and the tragic imbecility found no
apologist. Conference emphatically declared
for an adequate defence force, and said the
money would have to be found somehow.
The Commonwealth did most of the money-
raising for the States last year, and the
Federal liability grew by £33,061,358; but
it wasn’t an even growth. The London-New
York debt increased by £37,842,947 through
new borrowing, while the Australian one
diminished by £4,781,589 by reason of
some repayments. This illustrates the
very limited usefulness of the Bruce-Page
sinking fund. Any surplus of Common-
wealth notes will pay interest or repay prin-
cipal of local bonds, and any sort of tax will
produce that surplus. But it takes a very
big surplus of exports over imports (gold
or saleable goods) to pay interest or repay
principal abroad. That requires harder and
better work.
There are two thankful souls among the
Queensland Labor Ministers. Alf Jones,
Minister of Mines, said he was going to con-
test the Maranoa Federal seat against the
C.P. member. Hunter. Then he announced
that he would oppose Donald Cameron in
Brisbane. In the end he decided to stay
where he was, and it was lucky for him
lie did so; Hunter and Cameron got in by
thumping majorities. And Jimmy Stop-
ford. Chief Secretary, was plunged in gloom
when “Roaring Dan” Riordan beat him for
the Kennedy nomination. It is now Daniel’s
turn to be plunged in gloom; Grosvenor
Francis beat him handily.
The Melbourne volunteers who stood by
the shipping cos. —and the public—during
the waterside troubles are complaining
already that the preference they w’ere pro-
mised is largely mythical. It is always the
way. The bulk of the employers honor their
promises, whether made to volunteer soldiers
or volunteer wharfies ; but a selfish and short-
sighted residue forget all but the business
of the moment as soon as the danger is
past. They make more Reds than an army
of Johnsons.
In Melbourne on Saturday night the direct-
actionists who have been operating with
bombs, blew up part of a Greek club in
Lonsdale-street, and two poor wretches were
maimed for life —one may not recover —while
others were more or less badly hurt. None
of them, it seems, had anything to do with
the wharf war, but the mere fact that they
were foreigners was enough for the murder
gang. The police have made several arrests.
One man they bailed up in a car, and it is
alleged that they found a bomb in it.
An argument worthy of Harold Skimpole
was used in an effort to disqualify a muni-
cipal candidate at New Lambton (N.S.W.)
on December 1. The council owed him £4
and declared itself too broke to pay; and a
solicitor was found to furnish an opinion
that the bad back debt made him a muni-
cipal contractor and ruled him out. If the
brilliant idea of Skimpole disqualifying his
creditors was a sudden thought, it' was at
least a remarkable one.
The A.L.P. ran 500 candidates for the
N.S.W. municipal elections—the first held
under adult franchise with a six months’
residential qualification—and the Labok
Daily prepared its readers for sweeping vic-
tories ; but somehow they didn’t happen. In-
stead, districts like Canterbury and Lid-
combe made almost a clean SAveep of the
Labor aldermen who used to run them, and
a score of other places reversed the Labor
votes they gave at the State and Common-
wealth elections, the localities which ex-
Premier Lang represents or has represented
being particularly emphatic. The workers
were again bidden to remember that “Bavin’s
going to take eleven bob a week from the
basic wage,’’ but evidently this had less effect
on their minds than the sickening rascality
at the Sydney Town Haul. At all events,
it is clear that the generality of people don’t
want Labor politics dragged into their muni-
cipal affairs.
The allegations of shady proceedings made
by ex-Premier Slang against the N.S.W.
Savings Bank and its solicitors have been
investigated by a Royal Commission, and the
report is that there is no truth in them,
ftiang didn’t come out from behind his Par-
liamentary privilege and give evidence. But
a lawyer made a fleeting appearance on his
behalf, and said that “his remarks were made
merely as an argument in favor of a point of
view which he was stressing in the course
of debate, and did not reflect on any indi-
vidual.” The same might -possibly be said
about _ the remarks made by Rabbito of the
Loo m the course of an assault on P.-C.
I latfoot. They were merely an argument in
favor of a point of view, which was that
all policemen are better dead, and weren’t
meant to reflect on any individual policeman;
Friends or foes of
Arch dale Parkhill,
M. for Warringah
(N.S.W.), 'started a
report that he would
he in the reconstructed
Minis t r y, but he
missed. However,
Bruce has a vacancy
for a Whip. Labor
members, though not
exactly admirers of the
former secretary of the
N. 1 Nat. Federa-
tion, would like to see
him a Minister—they
feel they could draw
the peppery little chap
into an argument
whenever the spirit of
mischief moved them.
Followers of Trot-
sky, the dethroned idol
of Soviet Russia, took
to holding meetings on
the anniversary of
the Revolution, but
they won’t orate again
about the blessings of
Archdale Parkhill.
Freedom for a while —perhaps an eter-
nal while. They were arrested whole-
sale, 100 in. Kiev alone, and deported
“unhealthy localities.” Many locali-
ties in Russia are unhealthy for any-
body, and the rest are unhealthy for people
who don’t agree with the Government, so
plenty of accommodation exists for all hands.
There is a sinister fascination about these
methods. What a majority the Bruce-Page
might have had if it had arrested all the
Opposition speakers as fast as they appeared,
and disqualified Labor voters in general, and
exiled Jock Garden to an unhealthy locality
—one where the only stumps are crocodiles,
for instance!
The renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alli-
ance, which was dropped after the Washing-
ton Conference as a friendly gesture to the
U.S.A., is being talked of in Tokio, though
it is altogether improbable that anything
will ( come of it. Japan has practically re-
annexed Shantung in spite of America’s more
or less benevolent interest in that Chinese
province, and is worried at the approach of
Red Russia through Outer and Inner Mon-
golia towards Manchuria. It is suggested
that in return for supporting Japanese claims
to Shantung (rich in coal and iron), Bri-
tain might receive valuable assistance against
the rising tide of Celestial nationalism, which
includes amongst its demands the return of
Hong Kong, Wei-lmi-wei and the Shanghai
Settlement. But the Old Man in London has
other factors to consider.
In his dominie days
Bayley, M.11.R. for
Oxley (Q.)» learned
how to keep unruly
boys in order, and it is
considered at Can-
berra that he would be
a more commanding
Speaker than Littleton
Groom. He has been
a stern and unbending
Chairman of Commit-
tees. But it has been
acidly pointed out that
he dropped half of his
1925 majority, while
Hunter and Cameron
increased theirs. The
Bayley family lias
American associations;
Oxley’s member was
called James Garfield
after the President of
that name, and is an
M.A. of Stanford Uni-
versity.
Another wail comes
from England about
Bayley, M.H.R.
the wickedness of Australians who are mak
ing more socks and stockings for themselves
and importing less—imports are now only
about £1,800,000 worth a year. The reply
is that the Australian isn’t a centipede, and
that he is still buying a great deal more
from J. Bull than he can honestly pay for;
the honor of being the second-best customer
(populous India ranks first) for Bull-made
goods is more than the profit. On the other
hand, in the July-September quarter, Bull
was a bad fourth as a customer for Austra-
lian flour, taking about one-tenth of what we
had to sell, and he came behind France as
a buyer of greasy wool.
Russian Sovietism has been much less
openly aggressive of late. A recent item of
news is that Boss Stalin sent for Trotsky
from exile and tried to enlist his aid, but
Trot refused to alter his attitude, whatever
that may be, and returned to his lodge in
the vast wilderness. Probably he won’t play
second fiddle to Stalin lest he should be in-
volved in the downfall of the whole orches-
tra, though lie may be willing, after that
event, to start a brass band of his own.
Coming so soon after the publication of his
book of denunciation in Germany, this im-
plies that Trotsky is a dangerous individual,
yet unsafe to hang.
It is stated that the N.S.W. Government
cannery will only be able to deal with one-
tliird of the fruit available this season on
the Murrumbidgee irrigation area, and that
no one is known to have any feasible scheme
for saving the other two-thirds. In 1915-16.
so far as may be dug out from the statistics,
there were 16,812 peach-trees in bearing on
the Murrumbidgee, Hay and Curlwaa settle-
ments, and 101,113 coming on. In 1925-26
there seem to have been 218,781 trees with
peaches on them and over 82,00.0 in the flap
per stage. Things have moved since the’
and if nobody took a thought for the limi
tations of the red-tape-bound cannery, trouble
wag inevitable.
“Clifford Snook”; A perfect volcano of
hate has blown up in Labor circles because
the Minister of Agriculture took a walk in
Sydney Botanic Gardens to see if his depart-
ment was spending a great deal of money
and getting little for it. The blowing up
of himself and family with bombs is about
the. mildest threat, while the worst is dam-
nation for three eternities; the sentences to
be cumulative. One Keegan, said to be a
brother of .nabor ex-Minister Keegan, is re-
ported to have lost his botanical job in the
muss-up, and certainly the ex-Minister is very
angry. Yet is the case of a Minister making
a casual inspection of one of his own depart-
ments much more reprehensible than that of
a vigilance officer inspecting waterside union-
ists all day. on a wharf?
[For matter which has to be signed, S. H. Prior,
J. E. Webb and James Edmond, all of 214 George-
street North, Sydney, share the blame.]
THE MARTYR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Prendergast declared his intention of sifting
the allegation that an ejected interrupter at an
election meeting was struck by a policeman with a
baton or a piece of hose-pipe.’’
Take him up tenderly, treat him with care;
What is this clot that has matted his hairV
Blipped with a hose-pipe, to stagger and flop,
Felled by the blow of a brutal John Hop!
Hurled from the hall just for chipping at
Stan —
Think of it, boast of it, laugh if you can!
Brave on the path of his duty he pressed,
One of a lorry-load, all of the best,
Waging a war that admits of no truce—
True to the slogan, “No hearing for Bruce!’’
Women were there with them, Amazons bold,
Eager the right of free speech to uphold:
Free speech for them ; for the others—per-
haps.
Yet they were outed by conscienceless traps,
Outed and belted with hose-pipes, I ween.
Look, through your tears, at the bruise on
his bean !
Blue-metal volleys, and bombs now and then
Wrecking a house or two, chivvying men
Down to the wharf-side and tossing them
in—
Such peccadilloes are scarcely a sin.
Dinkum democracy labels them fun,
But there are things that are simply not done.
Stern and impartial inquiry will sift
Which was the cop who so lawlessly biffed
Yonder brave democrat* bruising his dome

“Morkrnm” : The recent dismantling of the
old Sydney telegraph operating-room brought
to light a telegram lost 25 years ago—it
had slipped behind a skirting-board. It read :
“Aunt Nellie dangerously ill. Very little
hope.” At this late stage it. hardly seemed
that the message could be of interest to any-
one ; nevertheless it was posted to the P.M.
at the town indicated, with instructions to
deliver, if possible, with explanation. A few
days later I got on to that particular line
AT THE GARDEN PARTY.
WAGGISH CURATE ( introducing local doctor to the Bishop): "The FILLER of our church,
my Lord.”
" to as ]j the outcome “The addressee and
her husband died within a week of each
other 14 years ago,” tapped out the sounder,
“Their only daughter was drowned a few
years latm The old lady mentioned in the
telegram outlived all the younger members
of the family and died here of extreme old
a„ c in February last.” Another example
of the leaning tree. She for whom, allegedly,
the "rave was yawning in 1903 was not
finally tucked in till 1928!

“Shep.”: Talking of queer guards (B.
21/11/ ! 28). On Salisbury Plains, after our
final leave before embarking for Australia, I
saw prisoners guarding sentries. We had
two prisoners in the clink, both for overstay-
ing leave, and a daily picquet was told off
for their safe keeping. As each man was too
intent on getting home to dream of trying
to escape, the picquet were usually absent,
One night an orderly-officer commenced the
rounds of the camp, and word was duly
passed on to the clink. As the sentries were
missing, the two prisoners thoughtfully
dashed for the wet canteen and dragged out
two of the guard, shot to the world. In
the guard-room the drunks were dumped on
the floor and covered up with blankets. The
officer on arrival found one of the prisoners
armed with an entrenching-tool handle (rifles
were handed in in France) doing his bent
around the outside of the guard-room, whilst
the other, standing similarly armed at the
doorway of the room, sprang to attention,
rattled off his instructions and showed the
officer the sleeping “prisoners.” As we were
a composite draft from all units. Two Pips
departed none the wiser.

“Adelaide”: The Presbyterians in Adel-
aide, influential out of all proportion to their
numbers, find that their two city churches,
in North-terrace and Flinders-street, are too
much for a population that now lives mainly
in more or less distant suburbs. They have
decided that (1) they cannot hope to. fill
both; (2) they cannot make up their minds
yet which to part with; (3) for the present
both congregations will be expected to attend
Chalmers Church (North-terrace) in the
evening and Flinders-street in the morning
under one pastor. The elders haven’t yet
provided free ’buses between the two kirks;
but that will come.

“The Bat” : I once heard a navvy wager
£1 that he would drink a bottle of whisky
straight oft' and remain perfectly sober for
an hour. Before attacking the. spirit he
melted half a pound of butter in a basin
on the. pub stove, and then started opera-
tions on the bottle. After much coughing
and spluttering, he finished the whisky and
then promptly drank the melted butter. He
certainly remained on his feet for the speci-
fied time, but shortly afterwards lie was
a pitiable sight. The butter prevented the
whisky fumes from reaching his head, but
it was apparent that he over-calculated the
strength of his digestive apparatus.

■“Sleuth”: The police succeeded in killing
two birds with one long arm of coincidence
when a man went into a Sydney cafe the
other night and, sitting at one of the tables,
was overjoyed to find facing him one who
had been a fellow-traveller on the ship that
brought him to Australia. To emphasise
his pleasure at the meeting, the. newcomer
called for wine, which an obliging waiter
brought, although it was after hours; the
other, not-to be behindhand in cordiality,
exhibited the case he had with him, explaining
that it was full of samples which he had
“lifted.” Just about this stage the police
arrived. It then turned out that the wine
purchaser was a probationary constable put
up to pass a marked coin on the cafe pro-
prietor as a means of securing a conviction
for sly-grogging; the double haul was purely
accidental.

“Bill O’Costs” : When. I observe the horde
of women with short hair I think how ridi-
culous the whirligig of fashion has made an
old local cause celeire. Long years ago,
when I served as brief-porter to an important
barrister, I listened to a vast amount of
impassioned rhetoric expended over the
wrongs of a recalcitrant young lady of 13
or 14, an inmate of a girls’ reformatory,
who had brought an action, for false, impri-
sonment against the matron of the institu-
tion. The matron, in order to exercise con-
trol over the rebellious young party, had
shut her in a room, and then, partly as a
sanitary and partly as a disciplinary mea-
sure, had cut off her long hair. . Two 0 f the
most successful criminal and nisi prius advo-
cates of the day, Villeneuve Smith (father
of the present generation of Villeneuves) and
.Tosiah Symon, Q.C., fired their forensic guns
at each other and two courts before it was
settled. In the end the Supreme Court made
light of the “imprisonment,” but the cutting
of the girl s hair gave old Judge .Boucaut
(who was always a champion for liberty of
the subject) a chance to let himself go m
an indignant denial of the right of anyone
to deprive a woman of her “crowning glory.”
He carried the Court with him, the flapper
got her damages, and, no doubt, kept her
head well covered until the “glory” grew
again. Nowadays, I suppose, she would have
a right of action against any rash official
who compelled her to grow her hair,
* * * *
bmada”: As one of the <t>o passengers
who arrived from England at Australian
ports in the Moreton Bay, of the Common-
wealth and Aberdeen one-class line, I am con-
vinced that these fine ships are bringing) full
complements of hardy settlers to fill any empty
spaces we have behind the drapery-counters.
Approximately two out of every three girls
on that ship were heroically determined to
cultivate Pitt and Castlereagk streets for a
living as shop-assistants. From Bnxton and
Hammersmith and Ealing and the. outskirts
of London they had flocked in their mipper-
dom. smart girls fleeing from the restrictions
of “living in,” eager to obtain any . sort of
job in the big cities and rejoicing in their
anticipated freedom. They were just as
STICKING TO IT, ANYHOW.
“She says she is only twenty-five.”
“Yes, and I think it must be true, dear—she’s been saying so for the last ten years.
smart in tTieir attire as the home-grown Aus-
tralian ; and though their accents were amaz-
ingly mixed, they knew their jobs. I found
no eager yearning for the Backblocks ; they
did not know that there were any about.
During the war some of these adventurers
had deserted their bargain-counters for the
land ; but that was only a memory, a happy
and glorious lark. Anjdiow, I did not dis-
cover a single girl who would admit that she
had come as a domestic.
“Detonator”: “Mullarula” (B. 14/11/’2B)
says that “many Gyppos regard ‘gibbit’ as
English for ‘give,’ while probably many city-
bred Diggers look on the word as good
Arabic.” It may not be good Arabic, but
nevertheless it does mean “give” in that lan-
guage, and its resemblance to Binghi’s motto
is only a linguistic coincidence.
' * *
“Quack”: There is interest in the news
that W. Fitzsimmons, the famous ophiologist
at Port Elizabeth s
110-less famous snake
zoo in South Africa,
has perfected a snake-
venom cure for epi-
lepsy. The idea is not
new; years ago there
was an American pre-
paration from rattle-
snake poison named
croatalin on the mar-
ket. It did not act up
to specifications, and
was dropped. The new
preparation may do
better, and there is
some sort of a prece-
dent in the recent dis-
covery that malarial
poison will cure par-
alysis. The point is,
which of the two great
groups of snake poi-
sons, the viperine or
colubrine, have been
employed for the South
African specific? One
affects the nerve cen-
tres and the other the
heart and circulation,
to put it roughly.
Since many of South
Africa’s deadliest
snakes, such as the
puff-adder, are vipers, it is probable that the
poison employed is viperine.
“W.I.U.”: For the Australian champion-
ship Hebe at Broken Hill easily beats the
Perth barmaid, with her award rate of
£5 3s. a week (B. 21/11/’2S). The silver-
town’s lady of the long-sleever gets £5 7s. 6d.
a week, that amount being conceded as a re-
sult of the strike of a month or so back in-
stead of the £6 6s. a week she asked for.
The 4s. 6d. more is really better than it
looks, too, as the index figure of the June
quarter for cost of living was four points
lower at Broken Hill than at Perth.

“Roka”: The Maoriland _ flapper had no
occasion to scrape acquaintance with a
soldier (B. 28/ll/’28) ; they were sold for
thruppence apiece by a patriotic association
which undertook to find a correspondent for
any Digger requiring cheerful items from
home. The buyer agreed to write regularly
once a month, send a limited number of par-
cels a year, and generally endeavor to brighten
the lot of the absentee. Out of this scheme
came several marriages, more or less success-
ful. sundry engagements that ended at sight,
and one b'rcacli-of-promise case. One attrac-
tive damsel, who went off in high spirits to
meet her “thrupp’ny soldier,” returned home
in tears of disillusionment: she had been
enthusiastically claimed by an elderly person
with a bald head, who frankly admitted lie
had deducted 10 years from bis a,ge to get
-away. Another was met by an illiterate
youth who confessed that his impassioned
screeds had been penned by a fellow-gunner
of high scholastic attainments, and he
seemed to consider he had a grievance when
the lady transferred her affections accordingly.
But the most astonished young person was
one who found she had been corresponding
with a man she had known by sight tor
years, and whose wedding she had wit-
nessed when a schoolgirl. He had gone to
the Front on the death of his wife.

“Lex”: A swindler who appeared before
Judge Curlewis in Sydney last week
addressed the jury for four hours and was
convicted. Then he began a speech to the
Judge, though further oratory was demon-
strably useless. A sentence of three years
hard labor and a declaration that lie was
a habitual criminal having finally descended
on him, “I have £1000 in assets,’ he said.
"Oh! have you?” interrupted ’Sonah. “Then
I order the sum of £400 to be paid out of
it to your victim.” The first move of the
Society for the Protection of Malefactors, if
such a body came into being, would be to
have “Silence” inscribed on every dock. I
regard it as significant that I have never met
a dumb convict; but I have known many
voluble ones, and I am convinced that they
owe their social and financial ruin to their
incorrigible love of conversation.
“Bloggs” : Sydney offers a striking example
of the impossibility of enforcing unwanted
laws. An ancient Act, dating from the period
when any form of washing was regarded
with suspicion, makes it an offence to bathe
anywhere on its handiest foreshores between
6 a.m. and 8 p.m. But so many hundreds
bathe at Nielsen Park from morning
till night (on fine week-ends the foreshore
is a miniature Bondi) that the local council
has erected dressing-sheds for the law-
breakers. Recently some Elizabeth Bay resi-
dents began bathing from their beach.
But other residents with enough money and
leisure to motor to surfing beaches- objected,
and no-\f the police, who are generally hard
to find when crime is being committed on a
mammoth scale, are in constant and vigilant
attendance. Tt recalls the fact that surfing-
only came into being around Sydney be-
cause enough people were found with the
hardihood to break an idiotic law.

From Paris unto Darlinghurst,

And rain poured down the streets to

“Detonator” : Talking of service chevrons
(B. 14/11/’2B) the French had a much better
system than ours. A soldier who helped to
win the war in a behind-the-lines possie had
to wear wavy chevrons instead of the usual
angular ones, and the same ruling applied
to rank stripes. It is worth adding that
a volunteer wore a badge on his right shoul-
der strap to differentiate him from his con-
scripted mate.

“Knib”: The superstition in Vic. State
departments that the Minister who improves
his own office will soon have a political

It was made something approaching a penal
offence for anybody not holding the rank of
Cabineteer to enter the sacred precincts.
Common folk were permitted to knock at a
window something like that in the side-pas-
sage of a pub. The finishing touches were
hardly put on the so-called improvements
when the Hogan Government received its
quietus.

“Lao-dah” : Those who still retain a lin-
gering faith in the Chinese herbalist might
study the evidence adduced from a specimen
of the clan at Stawell (Vic.) in an inquest
on a five-year-old boy. The son of Ham said
that he had been practising the healing art
for 15 years, having graduated thereto from
a wholesale banana business and a country
fruit, sweets and fancy-goods store. Called
in by ignorant parents, he prescribed a
powder he had obtained from China, also a
gargle. He did not know what either con-
tained, but the directions on the label said
they were good for sore throat. The tragedy
of it is that the youngster was actually suf-
fering from diphtheria, the serum for which
is definitely proved to cure in at least 95
p.c. of all cases treated.
* * * *
“Avril”: The tale of the visitor who was
mistakenly put to bed in a country hospital
(B. 21/11/’2B) recalls the experience of a
young man whose occupation of
meter-reader to a gas company
takes him regularly round the
outer suburbs. At one new and
ornate bungalow he was greeted
by a pretty young woman, who
hailed him effusively and told
him the bath was quite ready.
He protested, but she over-ruled
him, remarking brightly that she
must insist on his having it
immediately, to which end she
engineered him along the pas-
sage and pushed him gently into
seclusion, while he agitatedly de-
cided the lady was slightly
deranged and would probably
be more manageable if pacified.
He was still lurking in the bath-
room waiting a favorable oppor-
tunity to get to the gas-meter
and make a rapid exit after
reading it when the man of the
house arrived, and the gasman
came forth relievedly. Explana-
tions revealed that the husband,
expecting a country caller who
was to arrive after an exception-
ally dusty trip, had impressed
upon his wife to offer the trav-
eller a hot bath, despite his pos-
sible protests about being reluct-
ant to give so much trouble, and
the lady had concluded the
meter-man, with his little bag
and dusty appearance, was the expected visi-
tor, and in a spirit of eager hospitality
hustled him to his ablutions.

“P.M.”: Talking of Diggers’ critical
remarks on the get-up of statues reminds
me of the memorial at Yarram (Vic.). It
represents a soldier with reversed arms and
stands in the middle of the main street. When
the local Diggers were asked if the statue
was 0.K., they wanted to know why on
earth it was facing north when the town-
ship’s three are all at the south end
of the main street!

“R.X.8.”: Broken Hill’s “Bomb-thrower”
(B. 21/11/’2B) may make an impressive war
memorial, but does any community want a
ferocious reminder of war in these times of
peace? There is something far more appeal-
ing, to my mind, in the new St. Stephen’s
Church at Mittagong (N.S.W.). “When a
man’s work is done he goes home and hangs
up his hat,” was the homely inspiration of
this memorial to Our Glorious Dead, which
will be a Digger’s hat hanging on a peg in
the church.
*S«
“Bouragi”: Some of the cabled evidence
in the inquiry into the sinking of the Vestris
dealt with the difficulty experienced in sound-
ing the well to see if the ship was making
much water. It recalls an experience of my
own on one of the famous old rust-and-
barnacle liners which used to ply between
Queensland and the Western Pacific islands
in the long, long ago. A mate, new to the
old tank, told the carpenter to sound the well.
Chips did so very gingerly, lowering the line
with the iron rod at the end an inch or two
at a time. “Hurry up, man,” said the new-
chum. “Let the dam’ thing dror>!” “It’ll
go right through th’ blanky bottom if it
docs,” returned the other morosely.

“Murua”: The craving of an injured man
for beer (B. 21/11/’2B) recalls that one of
the hardest jobs of the stretcher-bearer was
the keeping of liquor away from seriously-
wounded abdominal cases. Again and again,
while carrying a water-bottle. I have had
to hold a man’s hands so that he could get
no more than a sip. And there were always
a flock of sympathisers, with water-bottles
and issues of rum they were willing to sacri-
fice for the unknown sufferer. I remember
a case at Flers when a Digger who had an
even-money chance put it up to a mate to
get him a stiff rum. The mate ploughed back
through the mud to supports, and collected
the rum issues of six others. It disappeared
before we had a chance to hop in. We let
the Samaritan go back feeling he’d done all
AT THE ZOO.
BLUE: “I wonder what storks hold up one leg like that for?”
CURL: “Silly ass! If they held ’em both up they’d fall down, wouldn’t they?”
he could to give his cobber a fair go, but it
was the rum that finished the patient on
the trip down in the ambulance.

“Rigalt”: American tailors still specialise
in pistol pockets (B. 14/11/’2B), but of a
new sort. Ever since prohibition arrived the
almost-invariable query to a customer is,
“Pint or half-pint pockets, sir?” Which
somehow reminds me of the steward of the
Aquitania and his historic remark of “Last
round, gentlemen, please; last round! The
Statue of Liberty is in sight.”
* # * *
“Let Go”: The clink at Moascar was
generally full of hard cases, whose crimes
consisted chiefly of breaking leave, and one
of them hit on an ingenious method of getting
“fags” into the compound'. The scheme
was simplicity itself; with outside co-opera-
tion the big black desert beetles were used
as carriers. It was found that the beetles,
once put in a shallow trench, would not
attempt to climb the sides but would carry
on until level ground was met with. Such
a shallow trench could easily be made with
a stick, and there were always half a dozen
leading into the wire entanglement. At a
certain signal a cigarette was tied to the
beetle and he was despatched on his errand
of mercy. The heads woke up to the dodge
at last, guards were put on patrolling the
fence, and the blockade-running insect was
presently out of a job.
* * * *
“P.M.”: The Yankee habit of carrying
guns (B. 14/11/’2Bj isn’t altogether fiction.
In my young soldiering
days I was stationed on
guard at Victoria Bar-
racks, Melbourne, and
after the orderly officer
had gone a mate and I
went down South Mel-
bourne for a fish supper.
In Clarendon-street we
met a sailor, half-sprung
and with a bottle of rum
in each pocket. That rum
had a powerful attraction
for my cobber, and after
a conversation with the
matelot he began to paw
the bottles. Uncle Sam’s
nephew stepped back and
announced that he “came
from the country where a
man is taught to protect
his Gah-darm liquor,” and
produced an enormous
Colt from each trouser
pocket. We parted from him rather hur-
riedly.

“Horace Spenlove” : These are days when
even bailiffs must move with the times. I
have recently heard of a member of the pro-
fession whose services are in keen demand
for serving writs on hardened service-avoiders,
or for taking possession under process of
Common Law. He is comparatively young,
and his method consists in dressing well and
going about his occasions accompanied by a
well-bred terrier. When he knocks at a
door the preliminary reconnaissance through
the window-blind results in the complete dis-
armament of suspicion. If the clothes don’t
satisfy, the dog invariably does. With the
portals flung open and a polite inquiry as to
identity answered in the affirmative, the
matter adjusts itself almost automatically.
* * * *
“P.M.”: However severe the tests for
motorists may be in the TJ.K. nowadays (B.
14/11/’2&), there were none in 1917. Our
unit had 30 motor-lorry drivers in it. A
list was made out for licenses, and in view
of a possible shortage of drivers the trans-
port sergeant added the names of a few
motor-cyclists and others who had never
driven in their lives. My job was to type
out the list, and I added my name and
obtained a license, which I still have, though
I never held a wheel till 12 months after-
wards. Soon after these licenses were issued
a party of men was sent to London to pick
up a convoy of lorries and, several drivers
being on leave and in hospital, one of the
spare license-holders was included, a motor-
cyclist who had never handled a four-wheeled
vehicle. The 12-mile-an-hour governor on
the lorry annoyed him, so a few miles out
of London he undid it. Then he got half-
tight, and tore through four country towns
in succession with a four-ton Leyland at 50
miles an hour. In the fifth town the entire
police force of the district blocked the main
street and pulled him up. The local beak
made it a month.

“Hayes Kop”: Somehow I can’t help
wishing that one of the “Rising Suns,” left
as evidence of the A.I.F. occupation of 'the
Wiltshire Downs, had been suffered to dis-
appear and the “Kangaroo” had been per-
mitted to remain. The first, though a
war-time badge, is no more emblematic of
Australia than the Southern Cross; the
second is absolutely so 1 . And as one who
used to look every morning in the long ago
across the Avon Valley at the Westbury
White Horse, I would like to think that
lone beast bad a zoological mate somewhere
to the south on those chalk hills. This
particular steed—there are four or five
others in England—was cut, an old citizen
of Westbury once told me, to commemorate
the jubilee of George 111. in 1810. Periodi-
cally it is cleaned or “scoured” (as Tom
Hughes calls the process in the case of the
Berkshire White Horse) by a conscientious
countryside, and as a landmark—and to
some extent a barometer—its utility extends
far over the Somerset border.

“Sick Ada”: It was a Sabbath evening.
Mum and Dad sat on the front verandah.
From the chapel near by came the strains of
an anthem. Cicadas- shrilled in all directions.
The old couple were drowsily content. “Just
listen to ’em, Dad,” said Mum, as the choir
in the chapel reached its highest note,
“doesn’t it sound beautiful?” “Yes,” said Dad
sleepily, “and the wonderful thing about it is
that they do it all with their hind legs.”

“C.Q.” : “Spadassin’s” story (B. 14/11/’2B)
of the South Carolinian habit of providing
accommodation for a gun in making suits
for gentlemen recalls the narrative of the
Middle West swain who had just led his
soul-mate to the altar 1 . When the parson
came to the query “Will you take this
woman to be your wedded wife?” the
’groom glowered fiercely and muttered “Say
'lady’ ” ! When the parson insisted on re-
peating the set phrase the insulted hero
drew on him so quickly that the man of
God had no option but to shoot through his
surplice.
* * * *
“Ribemont”; General Huguet’s offensive
remarks about General French and his staff
at the Marne are matched by those of a
famous English soldier —Captain Liddell
Hart, the military expert of London Daily
Telegraph. Hart points out in his book
“Reputations” that Gallieni (not Joffre) won
the Marne, and that he had to waste three
priceless hours in a fruitless argument with
British H.Q. before starting on the job. It
was Gallieni who deduced the meaning of
the change of direction made by the advanc-
ing Germans, and formed the plan of a
counter-attack north ot the Marne. He went
to see French, but the British general was
absent from his H.Q. The staff officers who
received Gallieni “were hardly in the mood
to descry the underlying qualities of this
most unmilitary-looking military genius, be-
spectacled and untidy, with shaggy moustache,
black buttoned boots and yellow leggings.
Little wonder, perhaps, that one eminent sol-
dier with a pungent gift of humor remarked
that ‘No British officer would be seen speak-
ing to such a comedian.’ ” Supercilious
incompetence was an outstanding feature of
many of those who supplied the brain-power
of the “Contcmptibles” during their epic
retreat; it is not foreigners who emphasise
it so much as Englishmen.
NOT ONE QUESTION
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ruby,—Come at once, I will not ask one ques-
tion ; forgiven all. Love. Alf.” —Age agony ad.
Who hinted that woman was richer in
charity
Than man for an erring affinity’s lapse?
Who reckoned angelic forgiveness a rarity
’Mong those who use razors and hang on
to straps?
To correct the idea —or reduce the disparity
’Tween the sexes in this little matter,
perhaps—
Meet Alf, who can pardon in toto his fair
For the wrongs that she did him, whatever
they were.
Did she smoodge and philander glad day
after day with him
And then, as the Yankees say, give him the
gate?
Or, if they were married, why couldn’t she
stay with him?
Did she up and desert a legitimate mate
For a handsomer chap who had more of a
“way with him”
Than Alf, whom one features a trifle
sedate?
Did she leave her liege lord for a tertium
quid?
No matter! She’s pardoned, whatever she
did'.
There are arms opened wide and a heart
still aflame for her—
No wowser complaints or reproaches
severe,
Not even the mildly invidious name for her
That Arthur apnlied to the frail Guinevere
(Or Rawdon to Becky), no blame and no
shame for her.
Ah me! but a greater than Arthur is here.
Was it passion that lured her astray? Was
it bunce?
She can wipe the slate clean by returning at
once.
Forgive and forget! Yes, but doesn’t it
tingle one—
The same being a feminine trait in the
main—
When now and again you may mingle (and
jingle) one
He-man who outdoes the forgivingest Jane?
Not a ghost of a question he’ll put, not a
single one,
And what she’s been up to she needn’t
explain.
Ho! paladin Bayard, Round Table Sir
Ralph!
Can’t you send down the ages a “Good on
yer, Alf”?

PERSONAL
ITEMS
In John Spence N. S. Wales has acquired
an Auditor-General who may make the office
what it was in
Rennie’s long day.
That dour old Scot,
stiff-necked and in-
corruptible, strip-
ped the State’s
figures of all
veneer, and a man
who will do the
same thing now
and command an
audience may save
his State. Spence,
still only in middle
age, started his
working life in the
Education Depart-
ment. and of late
has been head of
the Public Service
Board. In the
years between he
graduated b r i 1-
liantly in Arts and
Law. and in his
working hours
specialised in ac-
counts and especi-
ally in Costs.
J. W. PENNING-
TON, Minister for
Agriculture in the
new McPherson
Government,
Victoria.
Aubrey Abbott, Bruce’s new Minister for
Home Affairs, belongs to an old N. S. Wales
political family, and was brought up with a
reverence for Freetrade, of which, as he
confided to an interested House, he has been
thoroughly cured. He was in khaki from
August, 1914, to October, 1919, going to
New Guinea first and helping to round up
Jacko at the finish. As a Country-party man
Abbott captured Gw.vdir from Laborite Cun-
ningham in 1925 and beat him by much the
same majority last month. A pastoralist.
he owns Echo Hills station in the Kootingal
district, and is rising 43.
There were four big brothers in the Upper
Hunter family which has given the Common-
wealth a new Minister. One was killed
early, and it is a marvel that others of them
didn’t break their necks—they were the wild-
est riders of those wild parts. And the
wildest of them all was T.K., who was after-
wards Sydney’s best-known stipendiary
magistrate and Aubrey Abbott’s father. The
other brothers were Parliamentarians—J.P.,
father of the story-writer, was Speaker for
many years, and W.E. (“Wingen”), the
latter the most inveterate letter-writer to the
press that ever was.
Jack Curtin, who succeeds benevolent old
butter-man Watson in Fremantle, is far and
away the brainiest of the new Federal Labor
members. Editor of the Westralian Worker
since 1915—he left Melbourne for Perth a
few months after a stout fight against Willie
Watt in Balaclava —he has been a force in
Westralian Labor politics, his tongue being
as persuasive as his pen. He is a highly-
strung fellow, and the protracted count must
have been a sore trial, but second preferences
put him well ahead.
It is rare for a retired Agent-General to
enter Commonwealth politics, but Hal Cole-
batch and ex-S.-Aus. Premier Tom Price’s
son Jack have managed the feat together—
Colebatch as a Westralian Nationalist Sena-
tor and Price as Labor member for Booth by.
They were in the London offices of their
respective States last year.
Ned Hogan (Vic.) has taken his overthrow
badly, and Macfarlan, the new Attorney-
General, predicts that he will go down to
history as “the squealing Premier.” As Pre-
mier, Hogan drew £1551, but had to shell
out £l5O or so for Honorary Ministers and
Whip, other Ministers contributing in pro-
portion. Long Ned gets £5OO p.a. as mem-
ber for Warreuheip and £2OO as Opposition
leader.
W. S. Kent Hughes, the McPherson Gov-
ernment’s secretary, has crowded a lot of
career into his 33 years. Captain and dux
of Melbourne Grammar School in his day, he
was named Vic. Rhodes Scholar in 1914, but
learning had to wait when the war drums
throbbed. From a private in the 7th Bat-
talion he worked up to D.A.Q.M.G. of a
division, was four times mentioned in
dispatches and intercepted a bullet at Gal-
lipoli. At Oxford he landed a B.A. with
honors in history. The young man bosses
the Ramsay Publishing Prop.
Baron Tennyson, second of his line, who
died last week at 76, saw something of the
“long wash of Australasian sens”; he was
Governor of South Aus. from ’99 to ’O2, and
G.-G. of the Commonwealth for the two suc-
ceeding years. He was an amiable and essen-
tially practical-looking person; though he
dabbled a little in the fine arts there was
nothing _ to suggest the poet in him, and
the waving whiskers of his inspired sire had
been replaced in his case by a beard of
formal cut. His son, who succeeds him in
the title, is best known as a cricketer; he
lias the remarkable distinction of having cap-
tained England against Australia in the
later Tests of 1921 after having failed to
get his Blue at Cambridge. At his best he
was, and indeed still is, a very dashing bats-
man.
Dr. Harris, who succeeds Cohen, K.C., as
unofficial leader of Vic. Uppah Chambah, is
a member of the Cocky party by reason of
his association with viticulture in the north-
east district. He took his medical and surgi-
cal degrees at Melb. Uni., and was a resident
at Melb. Hospital. An lion. Minister under
Allan, he looked after Works and Mines
when Goudie was ill. Nats, joined with
Cockles m promoting him to the position
that Sargood, Davies and Manifold held in
other years.
Owen Cox, M.L.C., who is leaving Aus-
tralia next month to settle in the South of
France, has cut a big swathe in N.S.W.
affairs since he came to Sydney from M.L.
30 years ago. He has directed many things,
from shipping cos. to the Nat. Association,
but he will be best remembered locally as
that rarity a pastmaster in the art of living.
He provided his friends with exquisite cook-
ing and wines, and had »a fine taste in pic-
tures, furniture and the like. He was born
m Wales 64 years ago.
William Owen, a South Australian, has
.lust had a ninetieth birthday, and is still
going strong. The old chap heard the church
bells tolling at midnight for Prince Albert;
remembers Edwards VII. as a very young
Prince of Wales in Canada; saw Blondin
-—a legend to the present generation—cross-
ing Niagara Falls on a tight-rope : and was
m the U.S.A. during the Civil War. And
as a stage carpenter in Melbourne he was
present at the earliest appearances of Maggie
Moore in “Struck Oil” and of Nellie Stewart.
William Tilley, who died last week in
Sydney, left a fine record for straight dealing
behind him. Shortly before he retired from
his old firm it underwrote an issue of Smith
and Waddington shares, and, things going
suddenly wrong, it was left with over £40.000
worth. William Tilley didn’t attempt to
unload the bundle with which he had been
stuck. He explained simply: “I could only
sell them to my friends, and my friends are
worth a lot more to me than that.” He was
in Charters Towers before he came to the
Sydney Exchange 29 years ago; but of late
he has been more concerned with the big
cos. of which he was a director—the Hotel
Australia (managing), Cumberland Paper
Mills (chairman), A.P.A., Toohey's and
others.
Memories of the Speight-Syme case have
been revived in Melbourne by the feat of
Robert James Matlieson, an engine-driver.
He spent 11 days in the Federal Arbitra-
tion Court giving evidence in a railway-union
plaint.
Broken Hill is 42 years old, and though
there are a lot of temptations to go some-
where else it still has an inhabitant who
was there before it was known that mines
were hidden on the premises. As a boy
Alf Orman was with the survey party
which measured the claims at Thackaringa
and Purnamoota, and the talk about them
led Charles Rasp to think the big, rugged
hill in the Mt.
Oip p s paddock
might hold some-
th i n g. William
Jamieson, who
threw up his ser-
veying work to be-
come first manager
of the new mine,
gave Orman a job,
and he has been
there or there-
abouts ever since.
ANDREW
FLETCHER,
chairman of the
Wellington (M.L.)
Chamber of
Commerce.
Captain John Bruce, of the Torres Strait
pilot service, is known throughout the Seven
Seas. He was piloting the Tai Yuan through
the Thursday Island waters when a
Dutch packet bore down on her in a narrow
part of the passage. Something was obvi-
ously wrong with the Dutchman’s steering
gear. Bruce calmly ordered the quarter-
master to shove the helm hard over, a
manoeuvre which brought the vessel within a
few yards of Hospital Point in a big tide.
Still the big Dutchman came straight at
them. “She’ll cut us in two!” roared the
Tai Yuan’s skipper. “Then go an’ get your
now uniform on,” Bruce retorted; “you'll
make a prettier-lookin’ corpse in that.” The
Dutchman shaved past with six feet to spare;
and all Thursday Island gazing on felt
cheated out of a sensation.
Phomas Saywell, who died at Mosman
(Sydney) recently, aged 91, originated the
p.e. steam-tramway system which for gen-
erations connected Rockdale and Lady Robin-
son s Beach. “Saywell’s trams” and those
which thundered along Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, 30-odd years ago were believed
locally to be the noisiest on earth. Saywell
knew every notability in N. S. Wales' half
a century ago—most of them bought their
tobacco from him—and he pioneered the now-
popular business of reclaiming sandhills and
similar waste lands and turning them into
expensive residential areas. He was the
father of Brighton-le-Sands, and in most
things saw 25 years further ahead than the
next man.
N.S.W. Premier Bavin was momentarily
embarrassed by an interjector the other
night while addressing a meeting at
Chatswood. He was explaining that unless
the Government raked in a lot more tax-
revenue there would have to be wholesale
dismissals from the Public Service, when a
voice interposed: “I’m one of the public
servants you have dismissed.” Bavin fal-
tered in his stride until he had a good look
at his interjector. “Why, it’s Mr. Kay!” he
exclaimed, and the audience roared with de-
light as it recognised the Domain orator
whom Slang promoted to the Meat Board
and whom Bavin sacked. Incidentally, while
Bavin was holding forth, his brother was
presiding at a council meeting in another
part of the building—the brother is Mayor
of Willoughby.
To keep 11. P. Brown, Director of Postal
Services, the Commonwealth Government is
raising his salary from £2500 to £4OOO p. a.
Brown went to England to see that Aus-
tralia got a fair spin at the cable-wireless
merger conference, and made such an im-
pression that he received pressing invita-
tions to stay. He has been granted an
honorarium of £lOOO for his work at the
conference in addition to a rise of £l5OO p.a.
Richard Hind Cambage, N.S.W. Under-
secretary of Mines for eight years, 1916-24,
is dead at 69. Born at Milton, on the
South Coast, Cambage helped to survey the
National Park when he was quite a young-
ster ; afterwards he was a mining surveyor.
Botany was one of his hobbies, and he was
a member of many learned societies and
something of an author; his “Exploration
Beyond the Upper Nepean” gained scientific
approval. \
The Spirit of Australia, in which three
adventurous' Aussies, Moir, Owen and photo-
grapher Hurley, hoped to fly from Sydney to
London in record time, struck misfortune
from the beginning, and the chapter closed
with a crash at Athens. Hurley was the
only casualty, though the doctors soon
patched him up, but the machine is a wreck.
Owen threw up his job in the Air Force to
join the luckless party. ‘
As a young Irishman, Frank McDonnell,
who died in Brisbane the other day, worked
as a draper’s assistant, and when he became
Labor M.L.A. for Fortitude Valley he
availed himself of his opportunities to help
shop assistants, some of whom had to work
72 hours a week. The result was the Early
Closing Act. McDonnell left the Assembly
in 1907, but was a member of the Leg.
Council until Theodore abolished it. His
active interest in secondary education
brought him a seat on the Senate of Queens-
land University.
John Cowling, of Daru and the Fly River,
has made life one long string of adventures.
He saw rough times at Broome (W.A.), and
as commodore in the barque Southern Cross
brought a fleet of 15 lugggers from Broome
round to Thursday Island for a Sydney co.
When disaster overtook the pearling industry
Cowling started cotton-growing on Moa
Island, but the Protector of Aborigines
blocked him on the ground that his “boys”
had not signed on for shore work. It was
Cowling who found the treasure of copper
ingots left by some unknown ship off Mau-
biag; the Customs claimed it as treasure
trove, but the Law decided in favor of Cowl-
ing. who sold the copper for a small fortune.
Nowadays he owns a fine cocoanut plantation
on Mibu Island.
Westralia has two long-distance legislators
in Harry Gregory, M.H.R., and Senator
Walter Kingsmill. Both entered public life
iii 1597, and neither has been without a Par-
liamentary pass for more than a few months
since. Both were Ministers in Groperland’s
first and second post-Federation Cabinets in
1901 and 1902. Gregory, always a fighting
politician, had a lien on the job of Minister
of Mines in every anti-Labor Ministry until
Labor dispossessed him of his goldfields seat;
Kingsmill, more placid, scholarly and per-
haps philosophical, gravitated to the Upper
House and had made his way 'to the Presi-
dency when an ungrateful electorate at last
went back on him. And now, after nearly a
third of a century of politics, they find them-
selves in close association at Canberra.
The Hogans (Vic.) sidestepped appointing
an Agent-General during the 18 months they
were in office, and let A. H. Wright, secre-
tary and accountant, run the show in the
London office. Now that the McPhersons are
in command there may be something doing.
Edgar, M.L.C., who was in the running
before Fairbairn returned, is willin’, and
that is one of the reasons why he did not
bid for the Works portfolio. When Taverner
and Mcßride had set their hearts on the job
they got it, and Edgar is as keen on it as
they were.
Consul for Spain
in Jerusalem dur-
ing the war, Don
Ramon Maria de
Pujadas was the
only diplomat pre-
sent when Allenby
entered the Holy
City, with the
Westralian Light
Horse at the head
of the procession ;
he comes now as
Spanish represen-
tative in Australia
and M.L. Since
the war he has
been one of his
country’s officials
in Egypt.
Senor RAMON
MARIA DE
PUJADAS, the
new Consul-
General for Spain
in Australasia.
The Furneaux family, one of whose sailor-
members is to be commemorated by a portrait
in Parliament House at Canberra (Captain
Furneaux commanded the Adventure under
the leadership of Cook in the Resolution),
belongs to a type that i s not often found
outside England. For two centuries practi-
cally all the male members have distinguished
themselves moderately (but only moderately)
in the church, the army and the navy. The
present head of the family is a Dean; his
brother, a well-known Oxford parson, had
a son who did very well in the war and a
daughter who is now Lady Birkenhead. The
heir to the Birkenhead earldom takes his
courtesy title from his mother’s maiden name.
PUTTING IT PAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Do you suppose,” I asked a dour
Sir Oracle I know,
“That Binks”—a friend of mine and his —
“Would stick at any crooked biz
To make a bit of dough?
D’you think he’d jib at smashing through,
Though with lost souls it classed him,
The Decalogue, from A to Z?”
He thought a while then grimly said,
“I wouldn’t put it past him.”
“Do you suppose”—l queried it
Of sweet and gentle Marne—
“ That angel-faced and pure-eyed Con
Would keep a suitor off and on
In hopes of higher game?
D’you think she’d jilt a dozen boys
And take for lord and master
A padded, smirking, ageing beau
With boodle?” “Well,” said Mame, “you
know
I wouldn’t put it past her.”
“Do you suppose,” 1 asked Next Door,
“These aldermen of ours
Who manage this suburban show
Are all as pure as driven snow
And sweet as springtime flowers?
A whisper that their palms were greased,
When next they stood would blast them,
I take it, in the voters’ eyes?”
He, too, replied in cryptic wise:
“I wouldn’t put it past them.”
Now, whosoever coined the phrase
(I hardly think it’s Yank)
Conceived a notable remark,
A formula that’s frankly dark
As well as darkly frank.
It meets me when I sit in trams
Or down on beaches cast me;
It rises from the city stones
Each hour and aye in meaning tones.
I cannot put it past me.
N.S.W.
IFORD.


AT THE BRISBANE TEST—A STUDY ON THE HILL.
Poverty
Point
“C.R.”: One sign that Allan Wilkie is
getting stale through an exclusive course of
Shakspearean drama is his habit when on
the stage of seeming to count the audience.
It is wonderful how this little trick destroys
the illusion for the onlooker. Instead of
feeling himself a participant in the hopes,
fears and horrors of Macbeth, he feels like
eight shillings, plus tax.
“Flaming Youth”: The Stiffy and Mo
partnership—which off the stage has never
been a happy one —will end again after the
present season at Sydney Fullers’, and the
sundering is to be for good. The partner-
ship has had a long run, and besides handing
the Fullers a fortune and giving them a lead
in exploiting similar rough-revue combina-
tions, it must have handed the pair some
big dividends. Stiffy (Nat Phillips) goes
into panto; Mo (Roy Rene), who has been
a sick man for the last few years, may take
a holiday.
“Horace Howie”: As an actor-producer of
some eminence in the Smalls, where my
public—ah, how it loves mah ! —insists, never-
theless, on having its marrow frozen, even
at 25., Id. and 6d., I join issue with my
esteemed contemporary Maurice Moscovitch.
On the eve of his departure for other lands
Maurice had this to say of modern' tenden-
cies in drama: —
Charlatanism, that’s what it is. Trying to
freeze your marrow and make your flesh creep.
Working up blood-curdling sensations —bah.
Why, what’s the matter with efforts to make
one’s flesh creep? In “The Silent House
and one or two other of Maurice’s money-
makers there was plenty of effort in that
direction, and as for “charlatanism the less
said about that the better, perhaps.
“Prog”: Isn’t it about time the myth that
a good singer can’t get on unless he hangs
an Italian name to himself was exploded t
A programme in front of me asks, “If Alfred
O’Shea had called himself Alfredo Shanelli?
and goes on for a whole page suggesting that
the answer would be world-wide acclaim.
Isn’t it really a fallacy nourished by the
press agents of tlie near-topnotchers, who
know that in such matters sympathy means
cash’ Alfred O’Shea, whatever way you
look at it, is a jolly good name for a
singer; it carries an Irish appeal that is
very powerful everywhere, and its vowel
arrangement is excellent. For sticking quali-
ties it knocks names like Madame Belmas
and Signor Minghetti into a cocked hat. Any-
way, John Brownlee doesn’t appear to be
doing too badly.
“Cine Ma”: The movies are responsible
for some incongruous happenings, but none
so curious as that in a London theatre when
the King appeared upon the screen sur-
rounded by a cheering multitude. As his
Majesty was then believed to be at death s
door, the audience was undecided whether
to join in the phantom acclamations or
advertise its anxiety. Finally, by one of
those curious impulses that sometimes sway
crowds, it stood silently until the monarch
had passed out of sight, and then resumed its
seats. A more or less parallel happening
in Melbourne was when a family stood up
in respect to the head of it, who by a
coincidence appeared in a gazette of a race
meeting a month after he had been laid in
the grave.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Florence Austral had
a warm welcome, heaps of lovely flowers
and all-round acknowledgment as the fore-
most soprano resident in this country on her
recent return to London. The voice ot
immense range and power seems greater than
ever: it is under perfect control, and even in
the most declamatory passages never loses
its smoothness. She devoted herself mainly
to German lieder, groups by Brahms and
Strauss, a very exacting choice; and as one
of her encores sang “110-Jo, To-Ho” from
“The Valkyrie,” with which she lately roused
American audiences to a great pitch of
enthusiasm. The only English songs she sang
were the old folk song “A Sprig of Thyme,’
arranged by Percy Grainger, and “Drink to
Me Only with Thine Eyes,” which showed
the lyric beauty of her voice to perfection.
Her only assistant was flautist John Amadio,
who entranced the audience.
“Lever de Rideau”: It was a gala occa-
sion. The auditorium was chastely decorated
with blue and white hangings. The pro-
scenium arch was gay with flowers. The back-
cloth depicted a smiling country-side, over
which a perfect road meandered towards a
lofty mountain range. The stage was un-
usual 1 . There were curtains at the side but
none in front, and an inclined way led up on
the prompt side and a declined way led off o.p.
The producer stepped up to the footlights,
and the small audience —composed entirely
of pressmen, for it was what the French
call a repetition generate, a special rehear-
sal—-thrilled with unjournalistic expectation.
In deep tones shaken with awe and pride
the speaker described the star, whom the
fourth estate was to be privileged to see
before the country at large was permitted to
feast its eyes upon her. Pie pictured her
glorious body, her noble rhythm. He spoke
of her voice, persuasive, gentle, yet instinct
with passionate desire. Then he touched a
bell. The theatre was plunged in darkness,
except for a soft amber light that played a
trembling circle on the centre of the stage.
A soft hum like the murmur of innumerable
bees arose in the wings, the curtains
swept aside and into the amber pool swiftly
glided—Gladys Moncrieff? No. A super-
six, straight-eight, underslung, limousine-
sedan Royce-Royce model 1929!
“Cauboy”: The official statistics of the
late J.C.W. grand opera season show that
£51.000 was handed out to principals,
£31.000 to orchestra, £ll.OOO to chorus,
£l6OO to the ballet, and to the theatre staffs
about £12.000, while £15,000 went to the
taxgatherer. The estimated expenditure of
£BOOO per week was well exceeded, so the
cost of the 23-weeks’ season was doubtless
nearer £200,000 than £150,000. As a bare
quarter of a million music-lovers —a sur-
prisingly large proportion of them dead-
heads —attended, and the average price of
ticket could not have been much above 10s.,
it is hard to see where the Firm could have
made much profit. Which tends to show that
opera in the grand style_ is getting more_ and
more financially precarious, and that if it
is to be continued some of the stars will have
to suffer a drastic cut in their fancy salaries,
as lately happened to Hollywood s film
babies.
“Fade Out”: The harrowing tales of men
and maids who go hungry in hundreds at
Hollywood are true enough, and are a natural
result of the working conditions of all big
studios in California. A screen aspirant
finds it hard enough to get a job of any
sort, but harder still to hold one, as studios
often cease production and close down for
weeks at a stretch. Everybody, actors and
office staff included, but excepting, perhaps
the heads, is thus heaved out of a jpb with
no guarantee of signing on again. Most or
the men pick fruit; the screen-struck nap-
pers wire to grandma for their fares back
home.
“Hamfat” : The last curtain has fallen, in
England, for Edward de Tisne, well remem-
bered in Melbourne and Sydney for his
good work with Harry Green in ‘ Give and
Take,” but better in Brisbane as the .head
of a company which put in a long season
there with weekly changes. De Tisne did a
lot of bush-whacking also. His wife, a
leading lady, was Yvonne Banvard, later
of the “Rose Marie” co., who divorced him
in Sydney —theatrically, the Reno of Aus-
tralia.
“Cauboy”: “Within the Law,” now
having a revival at Melbourne King’s, served
as the original excuse for introducing Muriel
Starr to an Australian audience, on Sep-
tember 25, 1913, at Sydney Criterion. The
piece was rapturously received, and ran tor
one week short of three months. It was
the first of a long procession of American
crook dramas, and by no means the worst of
them. The two survivors of the _ original
cast now performing in the revival are
Muriel Starr and E. W. Morrison.
“Craiser”: Nancy Weir, a 13-year-old
pianist-composer of Melbourne, should go
far if there is anything in the judgment of
Ignaz Friedman, the famous Polish pianist,
and of Shura Cherkassky, the Russian.
Shura, himself an infant prodigy, listened
to this Australian example play a Liszt
rhapsody and a Chopin prelude, and
declared that he knew of no other girl of the
same age in the world who could do it so
well. Nancy comes from a country town in
N. S. Wales and learnt her counterpoint in
the Presentation Convent, Windsor (Vic.).
She has had less than three years’ acquaint-
ance with the pianoforte.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Ray Longford, whose
Australian-made films include “Margaret
Catchpole,” “The Mutiny of the Bounty,”
“Taking His Chance,” “Trooper Campbell,”
“The Pioneers,” “Sweet Nell of Old Drury,”
“The Blue Mountain Mystery.” “On Our
Selection,” “Rudd’s New Selection,” “The
Sentimental Bloke,” “Ginger Mick” and “The
Dinkum Bloke,” now has in hand a scenario
of “Robbery Under Arms.” He proposes to
deal justly with the romance, instead of treat-
ing it as a mere essay in bushranging. Inci-
dentally, “For the Term of His Natural Life”
had raked in £50,000 at the end of last
March.
“Bally Rogan” : What becomes of Poverty
Pointers tired of “resting”? Those I know
include a prosperous house-and-land agent,
a bottle-washer at Tooth’s brewery, a cocky
(doing well), a hand at a meat stall in the
Melbourne markets, a peddler of envelopes
and toothpaste,_ an attendant at a city under-
ground convenience, a journalist in a gooa
job, a spruiker for a picture-show, and a
yardman at a country pub. But mostly the
Pointer out of collar just continues to be a
Pointer. A sprinkling of one-time good actors
got odd jobs supering during the recent
grand opera season at 7s. 6d. a supe, but
since then they are merely poverty-pointing
as usual. Art is never appreciated.
“Craiser”: An E. J. Carroll distraction at
Christmas will be “The Wrecker,” to open at
the Melbourne Athenaeum. _ This is another
mystery wallop enacted mainly in a railway
signalling cabin and is by Arnold Ilidley,
the author of “The Ghost Train,” the most
successful box-office draw E.J. ever sent us.
“Dargong”: “L. de R.” (B. 11/10/’2B)
errs in describing as a member of the Chapel
Royal Lough, the boy chorister whose render-
ing of “Hear My Prayer” has been broadcast
as a gramophone record with bumper _ sales.
Lough (whose voice has broken) was in the
choir of the Temple Church, the official
church of the Benchers of the Inner Temple;
hence the interest taken by these gentlemen
in the publication of this record.
“John B”: Lithgdw (N.S.W.) can give
Malvern (B. 29/9/’2S) a run in the many
musical performances stakes. The Lithgow
Orpheus (orchestral and choral society) has
been giving performances for 30 years or
more and has put on more than 200 shows.
“O Kay”: Tal Ordell, who wrote the
verse “Waitin’ ” for The Bulletin the other
day, was one of our earliest screen-mum-
mers, as well as being a worthy Have on the
stage. He played in “Selection” films years
ago, when Snowy Baker was stunting tor
the same business.
“A.E.”: Reg Long, formerly a J.C.W.
stage-manager, writes from London that
Frank Harvey has gone several rungs further
up the ladder over there. He has been rated
by front-rankers Fred Terry, Leon Quarter-
mayne and Frederick Ross as giving the best
acting performance in London m Many
Waters” at the Ambassadors.
“L. de R.”: Frank Bradley is a South
Australian who deseryes larger parts than
the Firm has given him during his present
sojourn. His performance of Dr. Puttock,
the fussy divisional police surgeon of Inter-
ference,” is a little cameo of realistic comedy.
Bradley has done equally as well in bigger
roles. He was an admirable Napoleon in
“A Royal Divorce” in London, and scored
successes in “The Glad Eye” and The
Chaperone” in that metropolis.
“L. de R.”: It may be, as a Melbourne
coroner seemed to infer lately, that it is per-
missible for theatrical managements to allow
their employees to risk their own lives, but
what about when they risk the lives of then-
audiences ? A girl who missed connection with
her offsider in a trapeze act not long ago hit a
wall, but in turn after turn at local variety-
houses a similar fugitive would hit a portion
of the audience. In a recent act the devoted
performer upended himself from the _ top of
a pole supported on the hooves of his com-
rade lying over the orchestra. Thy gent
above was obviously in difficulties with the
proscenium arch, and though some of the
wobbling of the pole may have been histri-
onic, it might be carried too far any day.
In another popular act a girl hangs head
downwards from a trapeze which swings
furiously over the auditorium. Suddenly the
rope appears to fray, she shoots downwards
and is brought up with a round turn a few
feet above the stallites, some of them, no
doubt, unconscious sufferers from heart . dis-
ease.
GOD SAVE THE KING!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Time and again upon our ears it fell,
With curtain dropped and houses emptying,
A formula some gesture to impel,
A ritual a pious hope to tell,
“God Save the King!”
The lipworn phrases and the hackneyed air,
What vibrant message could they hold or
bring?
’Twas but a sign to rise and heads to bare,
And hum, by force of habit as it were,
“God Save the King!”
Yet now, wherever He encompasseth
The lands we hold, the race wherefrom we
spring,
The words go up, instinct with vital breath,
Fraught with new meaning in the shadow of
death,
“God Save our King!”

for HER_
f
The Careful Hand at the helm of your household
.... how often you have wished that you could do
something to relieve her of the two greatest of her
housekeeping problems. . . .the preservation of per-
ishable foods, and the daily arrangement of appetis-
ing meals which must have variety to continue
attractive.
In Kelvinator electric refrigeration you will find
the answer to your wish.
With Kelvinator she can plan her menus days
ahead, knowing that the reliability of the Kelvinator
system assures perfect preservation and easy
preparation of every kind of dish for every occasion.

vinator there are 14 years of proved efficiency; a
record of service and dependability unequalled by
any other system of electric refrigeration for the
home.
.... Buy her a Kelvinator for Xmas.
Not only will her housekeeping problems be simpli-
fied. . . .she will have much more time for leisure,
and her entertainments at her own home will always
be delightfully different, because of the freshness
and attractiveness of the great variety of delicacies

tion and longer life.
Kelvinator has a reserve of cold a tank of brine
which doubly ensures “Cold that Keeps” by retaining
a low temperature long after the machine has stopped
working through failure of current supply, or for any
other reason. Less stopping and starting, therefore
less wear on moving parts.
Remember that Kelvinator is the pro-
duct of an organisation whose repu-
tation has been built solely on pro-
viding reliable electric refrigeration.
The whole attention of this organi-
sation for the past 1 5 years has been

“Double or Quit,” which on Saturday
night brought Sydney Palace
after its few weeks’ rest, is a laughable t
with all the elements of musicomedy except
the music, though even that vyas incidentally
supplied per medium of a skirted orchestra,
modelled on Ingenue lines, and a tip-top ntue
bunch of entertainers. They ushered in the
slender but hilarious piece with a dusk,
bright few syncopations, and gave a tune-
ful lightness to the usually dreary intervals.
It might not have damaged the rest ot the
entertainment if some of the girlish gusto
had infected those on the stage—it, say,
somebody had recklessly burst into song, i t
several points the farce needed some sucn
acceleration. Its incredibility is unimport-
ant, but it drags dangerously in places, mat
a young spendthrift aristocrat should, square
his account with a bookmaker by asking him
to a social evening; that the bookmaker
should there perform with blatant imbecility;
that, not to miss a fortune that will come
to him if he is engaged by a given date, the
scion of nobility should advertise for a
wife, and draw a reply and photo from,
among others, the bookie’s wife; that, imally,
an old actor should be engaged to imperso-
nate the advertiser and should succeed _ m
frightening off the applicants by reciting
passages from “Hamlet” with the enthusiasm
of a Wilkie—none of these things matter.
They prove that John Charlton, who made
the' play, is a pretty weak craftsman; on
paper his lines are wooden and his situa-
tions crude. But that does not matter,
either, for the band of players gathered
together by Leonard Stephens and I rank
Rutherford —two of the best actors of the
recent Gregan McMahon company are
strong enough to give Mr. Charlton a very
unmerited boost.

his brother, is the genuine article. Stephens
is a first-rate leader, and a good-enough artist
to make convincing a part which, even
accepted as farce, rings as untrue as a hol-
low two-bob. James Atholwood, the imper-
sonating actor, does not appear until the
last act, at a moment when the piece is
dragging, but to his credit lies the whole
success. lie lifts up and carries that act

way, as the heavy parent, and Frank Haw-
thorne, as the butler, are good supporters,
but Charles O’Mara badly overdoes the
bookie, not to mention the fact that a course
of Pelmanism would do him no harm and
spare the prompter’s brassy throat. On tne
feminine side the party is satisfactorily
strong, with three quite-good cmnedy-makeis

tendencies), Beryl Barraclough (a gushing
respondent to the advt.) and Sylvia Clifton
(the bookie’s attractive wife), and a neat

orchestra along; they are bright enough to
cheer up a cast-iron Buddha.
* H-
“All’s Well That Ends Well” was staged
for the first time in modern Melbourne, at the
Princess, 1 last w'eek. It is by W. Shakspeare
and to put it in the language of the tiont
stalls the gentleman seems to know hm
onion’s. It is a curiously uneven piece of
work. The man who wrote the secona
act doesn’t seem to be the man who wr -
thp first, though possibly he is the same,
grown older. Whoever he is he lias written a
last act which is extraordinarily moving.
Also the incident of Parolles, a military bra„-
wart’ going out to capture a drum and bem*
blindfolded and led back to Ins own camp
is as good farce as lias been played m any
Melbourne theatre for a long time. _ T 1 _
leading lady, Miss Hunter-Watts, misread
her part, in this Showman s opinion. A ri'l
who extracts from a king a promise that if
she cures him of a fistula he will give hei
an y young man about the palace, and then
selects as the medical fee Bertram, a young
hot-blooded noble still unappeasedwithlife,
a designing hussy. Miss W atts simpp
made of her a tournament of elocution with-
out any discoverable human idiosyncrasies.
Dennis Barry’s graceful Bertram was a more
plausible conception.. This paper s syrfl
pathies are all with Bertram, who shows
himself an honorable lad by leaving his
compulsory helpmate on the marriagenig ,
when many a man might conceivably hav -
staved at home and given her a daily beat
in/ The pertinacious creature then Pursues
■him and obtains his carnal favors on a dark
night by impersonating his mistress. That
this event should permanently reconcile the
couple is somewhat
hard to swallow,
but the author’s in-
tention, unlike that
of most play-
wrights who turn
theatres into, pul-
pits, is obviously
only to amuse, and
in that he succeeds
admirably. And
yet, although Ins
motive is only to
entertain, he has
an uncanny faculty
for making his
auditors feel that
they have added
something new to
their experience. If
there is any fault
to find in him it is
his habit of mak-
ing truly deplor-
able puns, but no
doubt he will grow
out of it.

Muriel Starr re-
vived “Within the
Law” at Melbourne
King’s lastweek with
yes-and-no results.
Part of the play
wears well, . but
more of it is
threadbare. It be-
gins under the best
auspices as the
story of the girl
who, wrongly
accused of theft,
falls into the
clutches of the
law, and when she
falls out of them
resolves to use the
law for her own
advantage e.g.,
she is careful never
to commit black-
mail except through a reputable firm
of lawyers. Up to this pmnt the
theme is clad in well-fitting dramatic clothes,
but by the third act it has stripped itself
and plunged unashamed into melodrama in
order to allow Miss Starr to have a frankly-
in credible love affair with Robert Ginns, her
robbed employer’s beloved offspring. Miss
Starr rattles through her part on top gear
and the same register, though she seems all
the time to be drilling ever harder and
deeper for the dinkum oil of genuine emo-
tion. The play has its moments, notably
when Joe Garson, the forger, having been
landed for murder, finds a silver lining to
the cloud in the fact that soon all the papers
will be publishing his photo. This throw*
a new and refreshing light on the value of
the rotogravure sections in the dailies. A*
Joe, his original
role, E. W. Morri-
son shows brains
and experience.
Robert Purdie is
a lawyer with
aplomb, but Charles
Lawrence’s Edward
Gilder is an
employer made of
wood, and a chip
off the old block is
Robert Ginns as
his infatuated son.
A critic’s heartfelt
thanks are due to
Vera Spaull, erst-
while of musical-
comedy fame, for a
bright and amusing
portrait of Agnes
Lynch, the confid-
encewoman. Mayne
Lynton, as Police-
inspector Bur k e,
reveals that the
worst horror of the
American constabu-
lary system is its
elocution. Still, as
a stage John Hop
he is effective.

“The Desert
Song” continues to
trip along its gor-
geous way at Mel-
bourne His Ma-
jesty’s, and Vir-
ginia Perry, Her-
bert Mund i n,
Lorna Helms et cie
continue to visit a
sheik living in a
desert replete with
every modern in-
convenience. Lance
Fairfax begins to
show the wear ami
tear consequent on 77 performances of
a part which demands frequent and lightning
changes from the character of a romantic
Riff ruffian to that of the weak-minded off-
spring of General Birabeau; but his singing
of the popular ditty from which the play
gets its name is still the event of an even-
ing running over with sensations, 1. Haw-
thorne remains a French general somewhat
deficient in the military virtue of mobility,
but Stephanie Deste makes up for that.

Accustomed to seeing bellowdrama there in
its native and untamed state, this Showman
received one of tlie minor shocks ot bis lite
at Sydney Grand Opera House on Saturday.
The offering, called “Sugar and Spice,
would satisfy an Aberdonian that he had
had his money’s worth. There are no less
than 27 separate acts, and scarcely one ot
them that doesn’t give the audience a reason-
able excuse for exploding into at least an
equal number of laughs. Moreover, there is
no dragging; the bill is too packed to pci-
mit even of encores, and the acts follow one
another at a pace that would make a vaude-
ville roller-skater feel giddy. Arline Pater-
son and Lula Fanning are responsible tor
most of the pace; Fred Bluett for most of
the laughs. He wears wonderfully well, old
Fred. How long exactly has he been Dog-
ging about now? Longer, at any rate, than
any woman would care to remember; and
he’s as jolly, as kittenish in an elephantine
way as ever. To mention others that do
their sundry bits satisfactorily would be to
repeat the bill —the shotgun method of criti-
cism can be used, nobody missed, without
any serious twitches of conscience. As a
straight-out producer of the sort of laughter
that damages the ceiling the show has not
been bettered at the dim theatre on the
ancient site for ages. It can last for only
a week or two, having to make room tor
nanto.: it deserves a clearer course.

An interesting Sydney show of last week
was a demonstration by the Columbia gramo-
phone people of their new electric-reproduc-
ing phonograph, recording Gladys Moncrieff.
The instrument is not merely unusually
faithful; it is wonderfully so. In orchestral
reproduction it gives expression to instru-
mental effects that all but the trained ear
would miss in listening to the actual orches-
tra. It is not, however, a miracle-worker,
and so it cannot capture the consonants that
Miss Moncrieff does not use. Still, her voice
is sweet enough to compensate for that curi-
ous slurring defect, and the fact that the
sales of her records average out at 2000 a
day does not represent flattery. She is as
charming an entertainer per can as she
is on the stage.

At Sydney Tiv. the chief attraction at
the moment is the Ingenues, who are holding
up the other end of a well-balanced enter-
tainment. The Ingenues give a Performance
quite worth seeing twice, and the others aie
up to Tiv. standards.

Muriel Starr will sink below the horizon
as far as Melbourne King’s is concerned in
three nights’ time, after a season in which
the “Within the Law ’ revival was the most
successful offering. The crime wave at the
Royal is also due to subside on Saturday,
when Leon Gordon follows “Interference
with “Scandal.” * *
Principal new picture offerings in Sydney
for the week are “Varsity and Do Your
Duty.” at the Capitol; “The Actress at the
Regent: “A Midnight Adventure, at the
Lyceum and Lyric; and Heart Trouble
and “Almost Human,” at the Haymarket.

and some odd days, “A Turf Secret was

Saturday. At the coming week-end I rank
Neil anil co. will contradict Punch at that
address by giving as its advice Please Get

happens to-night (Wednesday) at the 1 lay-
box where the Macdougallites will present
the comedy “Four People” and keep it going
nightly for a week. On Saturday week
the Vanboucicaults replace the ticklesome
comedv “On Approval” with Miss Nell o
New Orleans,” which is limited to a weeks
run. “The Vagabond King,” at Her

and “Good News,” at the St. .Tames, are
bowling along like Larwoods.

Arnold Bennett’s “Mr. Proliack,” played
for Adelaide Repertory by Harold Denton
(singing teacher at the Conservatorium), has
the basic defect of a middle-aged hero,
frivolous in misfortune, gloomy in joy and
a cheerful liar, who is a creature of the stage
alone, and cannot be taken seriously; yet the
play is not a farce. This is Bennett s fault,
and not Denton’s; he gaye a polished ren-
dering, ably assisted by Ethelwyn Robin.
Charles Langley and Thelma Baulderstoue
as the Proliack family, Mimi Mattm and
Minnie Baker as business associates. The
piece has drawn three big houses. Moscc>-
vitch has “The Ringer” at the Royal. It is
a poor play, though it does its duty by cover-
ing up a 'mystery till curtain-time, and so
is highly popular. At the Garden Theatre
Humphrey Bishop’s open-air co. had the
great luck to start with the city s first ho.
week, and prospers accordingly.

Despite duller trading coilditions, which are
partly reflected in a contraction of £2,055,471
in advances and a growth of £2,959,920 in
deposits, the year’s declared net profit was
only £41,304 short of the 1927 figure, and
was 15.8 p.c. on average capital compared
with 17.3, 18.3, 16.3, 14.1 and 13.8 p.c. back
to 1923. So the 12£ to shareholders was an
easy matter, though a “not-to-be-regarded-as-
permanent” label was again attached to the
last 24 p.c.
That the shrinkage in the year’s net result
was not more pronounced is largely due to
prosperous conditions in Westralia, where
the Wales stepped from fourth to an easy
first place amongst the trading banks when
it bought out its old friend the W.A. Bank
as from March 28. 1927. The deal, which
cost the Wales £875,000 in fully paids, equal
to £2,012,500 at the market value of the pur-
chaser's scrip when the offer was made, added
£600,851 to the visible strength, and a fat
sum was whisked away to inner reserves as
well. Since then the published reserves have
been further fattened with £587,488 of sur-
plus profits, making the total lay-by
£6,068,653 at Sept. 30. The purchase and a
par issue of £548,440 shortly before the close
of accounts in 1927 made paid capital
£7,500,000 when the last balance was struck.

Australian conditions were mixed last year.
Wool brought in 5:1 millions more than the
previous clip; but the wheat cheque was
over six millions less than it was for the
previous harvest. There was a slackening
in public loan and other expenditure, and
business turnovers generally were below the
previous year’s levels. All this was accom-
panied by a decline in imports. Thus
acceptances fell away £1,657,069 and depo-
sits, mostly interest-bearing, began to pile
up. The decrease in the note circulation
was on account of the Maoriland business.
There was all-round movement amongst
the assets:—

Last year nety-building operations added
£125,000 to the book value of premises—
construction is going on at 25 branches, and
a start has been made with the new head-
office premises in George-street, Sydney.
The decline in the bank’s advance business
is partly owing to trade conditions and partly
to the block of Commonwealth securities
that had to be lifted by the underwriting
banks during the term. At Sept. 30 the
ratio of advances to deposits had fallen back
to 79.6 p.c.; it was 86.7 p.c. a year earlier.
But since the close of accounts the demand
for accommodation has strengthened. The
underwriting business —almost a matter of
compulsion—again shows up in liquids, which
were £3,521,554 stronger than at the pre-
vious balance

When the books were last ruled off 46.6 p.c.
of the total liabilities to the public were held
liquid as against 42.4 p.c. a year before that,
and 22.1 p.c. was in cash and money at short
call. Also the bank was holding only
£5 6s. Bd. of the public’s money for every
£1 of its own funds; two years ago the
figure was £6 12s. That does not suggest
that there is any immediate need for more
capital.
The market, mindful of recent events, anti-
cipates the future and pays £5O 2s. 6d. for the
£2O paid shares; an advance, of £5 2s. 6d. in
the last 12 months. The return at the cur-
rent price is only 4.S p.c. on a 121 p.c. div.
basis. The visible backing is £36 2s. 6d. per
share in net tangibles.

The remarkable progress of the society is
exhibited in the growth of its income since
the million-pound mark was reached in 1919.
Last year the total gatherings were £3,312,151,
or £288,473 more than in the previous year;
£2,628,570 of it came from premiums and
£683,581 from interest. Thus in nine
years the management has more than
three times bettered the income which was
the result of 43 years of previous endeavor.
After paying all exes. (£811,483) and
claims (£1,050,772) £1,449,896 of the year’s
income remained in the business, making
total funds £12,717,601 at September 30.
At that date the actuary figured liabilities
under policies at £12,253,670, thus leaving a
surplus of £463,931, or £62,265 more than
was available in the previous year. All
but £20,561 of the surplus is to be distri-
buted amongst policy-holders as reversionary
bonuses —£303,422 in the Ordinary and
£139,947 in the Industrial department.
In the Ordinary branch new business writ-
ten was again a record. Here are some in-
teresting comparisons:—
1911. 1927. 1928.
Policies .. . . 9,665 21,150 21,870
Amount . . . . 995,987 5,217,523 5,304,552
New premiums . . 29,941 174,160 180', 187
Average policy .. 103 246 242
Average premium p.c. £3/17/10 £3/16/8 £3/16/10
The increase in the average amount per
policy over the last 17 years is 137 p.c.,
but most of it represents the decrease in
the purchasing power of money. To-day £179
is worth no more than £lOO was in 1911.
That the average premium per cent, then
was higher than it is now probably means
that a bigger proportion of whole-of-life busi-
ness is written these days.
Assuming that old business costs 7 p.c.
of the renewal premiums, and charging the
balance of the year’s exes, against new busi-
ness, then last year’s first premiums cost
78.7 p.c. compared with 79 p.c. and 78 p.c.
in the preceding terms. It is extremely un-
likely, however, that old business can be
handled so cheaply, in which case new busi-
ness costs would be less. But on the same
basis (7 p.c.) it is costing some of the young
offices 200 p.c. and more to write their poli-
cies.
Industrial business, which figures promi-
nently in the T. and G.’s activities, reflects
the generally quieter conditions that pre-
vailed during the term. For the 12 months
to September 30. £6,194,173 of business was
written under 126.752 policies, and that was
£71,867 less than in the previous year, when
1384 more policies were issued. The aver-
age amount per policy was £49 compared
with £49 and £4B back to 1926. But it
cost less to put last year’s business on the
books, the ratio of exes, to premium income
dropped to 37.6 p.c. as against 38.2 p.c. and
38.6 p.c. in the two preceding years
The next comparison shows what it costs
to handle each department as a whole: —

To policy-holders each drop in the rate should
mean better bonuses. That a tight hold was
kept upon exes, last year is obvious from
the cut in the rate in each department. An-
other factor contributing to the decline has
been the annually-expanding returns from
interest, etc. In this connection a steady
improvement in the rate of earnings has
helped to widen the margin available for
surpluses:—
Interest Earnings p.o. op Average Funds.

1922 .. 5 7 0 „ 1927 .. 5 13 3 „
1923 .. 5 7 6 „ 1928 .. 5 14 0 „
The office assumes a future net return of
3 p.c. and 3| on its funds; actually, these
brought in £5 14s. Od. p.c. last year. All
this and a very favorable claims experience
—it was only 35 p.c. of expectancy in the
Temperance section and 59.7 p.c. in the Gen-
eral section last year—must, of course, mean
better bonuses.
The funds of the two departments, to-
gether with the fidelity and contingency fund
(£105,000), deposits (£551,588) and out-
standing claims, etc. (£43,014) —total
£13,417,203—are invested in these propor-

Two years ago mortgages stood in the books
at £449,595; they were £1,572,012 at the
close of last accounts. Over the same period
£361,486 has been added to the book value
of freeholds (£1,235,279). For the most
part, the increase represents the outlay on
the society’s new head office premises, now
nearing completion in Melbourne, and on a
new building in Wellington (M.L.). From
the point of view of public policy, it is good
to see these big money-gathering concerns
making larger advances to home-purchasers:
but it brings in a shade less certainty about
future profits and therefore future bonuses.
And it certainly calls for a large provision
out of profits for a contingency or investment
fluctuations fund.

The purchase of Castlemaine in 1926 and
Emu in 1927 gave Swan practically a mono-
poly of the trade in Westralia. That and
the recent prosperity there, due to a suc-
cession of good seasons and the rapid growth
of the pastoral and agricultural industries,
must, of course, mean fat returns, though
for the moment the outlook is a shade
less rosy than it was. The net profit
for the last half was more than twice
the figure for the corresponding half of
1926, and an extra 4 p.c. has been tacked on
to the div., making it 20 p.c. The spring in
the declared net result for the 12 months to
Sept. 30 (£124,917) was £26,056, but that
includes £9147 profit from W. A. Glass
Manufacturers on the sale of some of its
assets. Incidentally, -the figure represents
exactly the book value of Swan’s holding in
the Glass co. 12 months ago.
A curious feature is that earning power
has shown marked improvement over the last
two years, notwithstanding the addition of
£117,259 to paid capital during that time.
After allowing for the prefs.—they call for
£3OOO p.a.—the balance of the year’s net pro-
fit was a juicy 28.6 p.c. on the average ord.
capital compared with 28, 23.7, 21.1 and -3.8
p.c. back to 3,924. One factor which has
helped tremendously toward the improved
showing is that reserves have expanded at a
greater rate than paid capital. That is
mainly because the recent purchases were
put through largely on the basis of an ex-
change of shares; as a result of this Swan
has been able to add no less than £124,779
to visible reserves. That was in addition to
£14,957 share premiums, £13,720 from the
sale of assets and £64,043 from ordinary trad-
ing profits, .etc. Moreover visible accumula-
tions have grown so corpulent that they were
£67,513 in excess of paid capital at Sept. 30.
And there may be. probably is, some true
profit in the £59,471 tagged “accounts in
credit, including goodwills accruing.”
Another factor that adds to the increasing
attractiveness of the position is the saving
in overhead that has followed on the heels
of the recent purchases. Exes. (£132,202, up
£27,222) took 44.6 p.c. of last year’s gross
profit (£295,861, up £61,856) as against
44.8 p.c. and 51.2 p.c. in the two preceding
years. A bigger allowance was made for
depreciation (£47,889 as against £31,438 in
the previous year), also the outlay on repairs
and maintenance (£21,508) was £6340
heavier than in the preceding year.
Incidentally, the family stocking is sus-
pected of being so full as to be almost over-
flowing. Here is as much as balance-sheet

plant stands at £160,622, up £12,586.
The increase of £102,057 in the book value
of shares in other cos. mainly reflects the
Emu purchase. That co.’s scrip appears to
have been taken into Swan’s books at
£15,900-odd less than its net tangible book
value at March 31, 1927. Treating accounts
in credit, etc., as a liability, the more or less
liquid surplus (£120,379), including mort-
gages and stocks but apart from shares in
other cos., was £67,608 stronger than it was
12 months earlier —the increase was in cash.
Paid capital is in 50,000 £1 6 n.c. cum.
prefs. and 340,359 255. ords. The market,
much impressed by the co.’s greatly-improved
position, obviously considers that benefits
cannot be long delayed. It pays 88s. for the
scrip, which buyers priced at 665. 12 months
ago. At the higher figure the return is only
4.5 p.c. on a 20 p.c. div. basis. The visible
backing amounts to 565. lid. per share in
net tangibles. The well-protected prefs. sel-
dom appear on the market.

Business last year showed marked improve-
ment, the board says, and figures support
the statement. The spring in gross profit
(£55,146) was £5514, but exes. (£41,557) took
£3928 of that, so net profit was only £l5BO
better. However, bigger allowances were
made for depreciation and taxation than in
the previous year. The net addition to the
depreciation reserve was £2600 as against
£l2OO in 1927, and £3OOO was added to the
reserve for taxation, which had remained
stationary for the preceding four years. But,
though net earnings were thus a trifle better,
after allowing for pref. requirements (£560)
the balance of the year’s profit was only
8.4 p.c. on the ordinary capital. In previous
years it had been 7.3, 6.2, 6.1 and 5.7 p.c.—
that goes back to 1924. They are not very
impressive figures.
Moreover they may not be quite all they look.

before building costs and city property values
took their war-time leap. The ords. got their
first div. (10 p.c.) in 1918. Splendid pro-
gress was made, and two years later the
assets were written up £54,414, and £75,000
of bonus scrip was handed out, thus doubling
the ord. capital. While the boom lasted
a few 10 p.c. divs. were paid, but for the
last half-dozen years—and they have been
far from lean ones—it has been a struggle
to make anything like a decent showing on
the capital as written-up. Since 1923 share-
holders have averaged 7.2, but it has taken
all but £355 of what the board has called
profit to do it. At August 31 the book value
of tangible assets was still £14,521 short of
the £163,000 of paid capital—£7ooo of it is
in 8 p.c. cum. prefs.—and the div., which
was lifted a point to S p.c., is running
perilously close to earnings.
These figures show the position from an-
other angle:—
1923. 1926. 1927. 1928.
Liquid assets .. £12,256 £10,250 £8,195 £9,847
Liabilities .. 31,442 36,912 38,611 33,120
Excess liabilities. . £19,186 £26,662 £30,416 £23,273
The year’s bigger earnings enabled the board
to wipe £5491 off the debt, reducing it to
£33,120, including £25,603 owing to the bank.
The more-or-less liquids, including stocks
(£5094), increased £1652; thus the excess of
liabilities was reduced by £7143. Still, apart
from fixed assets, shareholders were visibly
£4087 worse off than at the close of accounts
in 1923. The freehold is in at £161,358, un-
changed during the last three years. So,
all things considered, it is not certain that
the dividends paid during the last five years
have been wholly earned.
The market, which backs the management
and anticipates the future, values the ords.
at 255. A little over a year ago 225. was
paid, but the price eased to 19s. 6d. follow-
ing the publication of accounts in 1927. At
the current price the return is 6.4 p.c. as
long as the 8 p.c. div. continues, and it is
by no means secure. The backing amounts
to 18s. Id. per share in net tangibles—all of
it represented by premises.

The success of the co.’s chemical (super-
phosphate) works and, on the mining side,
bigger tonnages, higher recoveries and re-
duced costs together with a rise in the price
of copper—electrolytic averaged £67 per ton
compared with £62 11s. lid. in the previous
year and an average of £69 Is. lOd. for the
five years before that—were chiefly respon-
sible for the jump in last year’s figures.
After allowing for prospecting, development
and depreciation charges, shown as written
off in the table, the net result mounted to
15.4 p.c. on capital compared with 14.9, 12.1,
13.8 and 14.7 p.c. back to 1924. In .Tune
Is. per share was distributed; and share-
holders will get Is. 6d., including 6d. bonus,
on Dec. 19, thus lifting the div. rate to 124
p.c.
The bulk of the co.’s profits are won from
its extensive superphosphate interests, though
mining continues to represent a substantial
and, indeed, growing part of the activities.
Last year developments took place which are
likely to have an important bearing upon
future profits in the mining section of the
business. These were the completion of the
North Lyell tunnel and of the electrolytic
refinery at Queenstown. The refinery, origin-
ally to cost £75,000, was in the books at
£95,287 at Sept. 30. It was in commission
for only the last five months of the term,
and turned out 2454 tons cathode copper
and 30 tons silver slimes. This output was
treated at Port Kembla by the Electrolytic
Refining and Smelting Co., which co. hither-
to had also treated Lyell’s outturn of blister.
However, it should not be long now
before every operation from winning the ore
to the production of marketable copper is
being performed on the spot. All told a
saving of about £4 per ton of copper pro-
duced has been mentioned.
Chief developmental work was the com-
pletion of the North Lyell tunnel (total
length, 6952 ft.), which directly connects the
North mine with the treatment works by
electric tramway, thus dispensing with the
costly old haulage system and facilitating
other economies. But since the first train-
load of ore was only brought through the
tunnel on Sept. 4, the last accounts could
not have benefited much from the change.
The work, which cost the co. £60,000, figured
in the accounts at £40,310 at Sept. 30.
Last year 21,797 tons more crudes was
raised than in the previous term. Here are
output and recovery figures:—

The production of copper was the largest
since 1915, due mainly to the bigger ton-
nages of ore treated. Last year’s overall
copper recovery was 93.03 p.c. compared
with 92.55 p.c. for 1927 and 90.74 p.c. for
1924. The technical staff, which paid special
attention to flotation, was able to produce
a concentrate of much higher grade than
hitherto; the benefits of this are expected
to show up in the current year’s figures.
Amongst other things, it should help to re-
duce coke consumption per ton of copper
produced. Last year's consumption was 0.63
ton as against 0.96 ton in 1925.
During the term the diamond drill proved
the existence of large quantities of low grade
ore in the Prince Lyell and Lyell Tliarsis
leases. At the Comstock, where production
ceased about seven years ago, approximately
500,000 tons ore averaging about 31 p.c.
copper has been opened up. The board
has no doubts about being able to profit-
ably treat this. Ore reserves have not been
recalculated; a year ago they were as fol-
lows :

Because of alterations in the treatment the
production of pyrites at Mt. Lyell ceased
nearly two years ago.
The co.’s superphosphate interests were
further expanded by the purchase of a sub-
stantial interest in Australian Fertiliser
Pty., Ltd, which caters for the N. S.
Wales and Queensland markets, and in which
Cuming, Smith and Co. and Nobel (Aus-
tralasia), Ltd., are also interested. The works
are at Port Kembla. The deal is reflected in
an increase of £126,662 in the book value

Last year £25,383 more was written off than
was spent upon chemical works. The item
includes a holding in Mt. Lyell Farmers'
Fertilisers, Ltd., which took over the co.’s
Fremantle (W.A.) works in 1927. With a
view to further livening turnover and re-
ducing costs the Westralian co. —it paid 10
p.c. in its first year—recently bought the
super, interests of Cuming, Smith and Co.
there.
Despite heavy outlay on plant, develop-
ment and shares, the more-or-less liquids
were £46,517 heavier than at the previous
balance. But £195,264 was added to the
debt. Thus the more-or-less liquid surplus
was £148,747 lighter:—

Surplus £950,361 £983,730 £790,202 £641,455
Bigger turnover, a poorer wheat harvest and
the Moratorium Act in Vic. were mainly
responsible for the growth in book debts,
while shipping troubles helped metal stocks
to pile up.
Paid capital is £1,289,195 in £1 shares.
The market, impressed by the co.’s prospects,
pays 395. for these. After allowing for the
accruing div.. the immediate return at that
figure is 6.6 p.c. on a 12f p.c. div. basis. The
backing amounts to 41s. Bd. in net assets;
including the mine, 7s. lOd. per share.

New Guinea Gold and Osmiridium and
New Guiuea Goldfields Exploration of Lon-
don, whose interlocking of interests has
caused some heartburnings among share-
holders of both cos. recently, had a good old
joint pow-wow last week, and resolved that
both were opposed to the proposed amalga-
mation of Exploration with the Urquhart
Syndicate, which is being formed to develop
the Edie Creek field. It was'further resolved
by the two cos. to work the Golden Peaks
leases, a separate co. to be formed for the
purpose. Exploration will retain and work
the other group of leases, known as the
Golden Chance. Exploration bought the
Golden Peak leases from Osmiridium for
shares in the purchasing co. for every eight
in the vending co. The purchase scrip
(SO,OOO shares) is in Sydney, but cannot
be issued until 119,000 of Exploration’s
shares held in England are placed on the
Australian register. A special committee
has been apopinted to deal with the present
tangle. Whether those on Exploration’s
English register will agree with the Aus-
tralian action in turning down the Urquhart
offer remains to be seen.

Placer Development has issued an interim
report with reference to the testing of the
three leases on the Bulolo held under option
from Guinea Gold. Owing to the stony nature
of the ground, the upper portion of the
Southern leases has proved undrillable, so
pitting has been resorted to. The first line
of bores was 2i miles from this upper and
southern portion, and, as completed, indi-
cates a dredging width there of a little over
500 yards, the average depth being 24ft.
Values are said to “exceed expectations,” but
they have not been published. The next
line of holes, 20 chains further north, is
now being bored. Placer’s option is until
June 30, 1930, by which time it is hoped
some sort of a practicable road from the
coast to the goldfield will have been com-
pleted. The testing of the leases should
occupy another six months.

“Old Warden”: Messrs. Cogliill, Miller
and Reid are returning to Papua to develop
gold deposits located by them at the head
of the Lakekamu, on the western slope of
the range which divides New Guinea from
Papua. The Lakekamu was discovered over
18 years ago by the Prykes and other
Papuan prospectors with years of experi-
ence. Many thousands of ounces were taken
from the field, and the surrounding country
was thoroughly combed by dozens of men
who had been prospecting in Papua for
years. It may be that the enthusiastic new-
comers have found quantities of gold where
the Prykes and their mates failed to locate
it. but the death-toll of Papuan goldfields
has been a heavy one.

South Kalgurli, the lone div.-payer on
Ivalgoorlie’s Golden Mile, continues to treat
ore of 375. Gd. grade and make a profit of
7s. —a good margin where ore reserves are
considerable as in this case. While these
conditions last divs. of 2s. Gd. p.a. can be
expected. Sons of Gwalia is another well-
managed show, but the grade in this case is
only 255., which does not enable the co. to
keep above the breadline. Considering it
hauls its ore 4000 feet on the underlie, it
does well to keep running at all, even making
allowance for some Government assistance.

Wiluna’s new main shaft is nearly 200
feet deep, but it is a gruelling job. First
the sawn karri has to be railed 600 miles
and then carried 100 miles by motor-trucks.
The shaft is 25ft. by 7ft. inside of timbers,
divided into five compartments. Hauling
will be done by two winding engines installed
on opposite sides of the shaft.

Empire Extended, alias Lass of Gowrie,
has just replenished its till by selling 20,000
forfeited shares at 3d. Several blanks and
one unlucky miss are in its record to date.
Blanks include duffers and delusions on vari-
ous out-back Westralian fields; the miss was
at Yilgarn. Now, after unprofitable experi-
ences in other parts, it has gone back to
the latter field and claims to have got hold
of something attractive. A call or two will
probably follow this announcement.
* * * *
Although the Yilgarn goldfield is being
well tested over a length of 100 miles by a
width of 40 miles, the Radio, a privately-
owned show, continues to be the only con-
sistent profit-earner. Radio owners have
joined the numerous wheat-farmers now sur-
rounding their show, and give the battery
and harvester a run in turns. The latter,
by the way, is not perfoming up to expec-
tations this season.

An impression prevails in the London
market that a Gt. Boulder div. Is not far off.
It is years since the last was paid, and
until the advent of tributors, followed by
the discovery of gold in places previously
unsuspected, it looked as if shareholders
would never get another. The position of
the co. has taken a decided change for the
better during the past 12 months, and
finances are now good enough to warrant
a distribution being made at any time.

Great Fingal, once the best mine in W.A.
outside the Golden Mile, is a depressing
sight nowadays. The 40- and 60-stamper
batteries ar<> skeletons; all worth-while that
remains is the 105 ft. lattice-steel headgear
that stands like a wireless tower in an area
of desolation.
sj: * * :}t
The advisory committee of three recently
appointed by Mararoa directors has inspected
the mine and plant at Cue (W.A.). The
fact that the committee’s members are gen-
erally hundreds of miles apart seems likely
to prove a source of weakness in connection
with its activities.

Drilling for oil in California is entering a
new phase in which there is no set depth-
limit. The best oil-well at Signal Hill is
producing at 7800 ft., and machinery has been
perfected that will permit drilling to 10,000 ft.

OVER 40 years ago, the “Gluckauf,” of 3000 tons burthen, was
built and launched from our Tyneside Yards for carrying oil in
bulk across the Atlantic, being the first vessel of her class.
It was little realised in those far-off days of 1886 that from this
pioneer vessel, in fact, the originator of the term ‘Tanker, would
develop the world-wide oil transport service of to-day.
Only a few months ago we launched our 154th Tanker, “Scottish
Heather,” of over 10,000 tons d.w.
To-day, as 40 years ago, Armstrong Whitworth are pioneers in the
development of oil-carrying vessels.

“Pick”: “Eureka’s” yarn (B. 7/11/’2B)
about white ants making their way through
galvanised-iron is plain bunkum. On the
N.S.W. middle South Coast—a district
notorious for its white-ant depredations —
the termites in a few months will com-
pletely riddle any unprotected house built
of spotted gum, Oregon, or Baltic pine. Pro-
vided with ant aprons, though—inverted
dishes of gaivanised-iron over the box
foundation blocks —the buildings stand unmo-

lested for years. In 1907 at Central Tilba
a courthouse and a doctor’s residence
of similar materials were built side by side,
the latter with ant aprons and the former
without. In six months the courthouse was
eaten to a shell; the residence still stands
sound without a trace of the insects in its
walls.
“Phella": Re treacherous Binghis (B.
24/10/’2B). Never since an incident in Banana-
land have I worried an abo. at my rear.
Snowdrop was a full-blooded Northerner
who for over a year was my shadow. But
I always made sure the sun shone from my
back. One day I was dozing in a hammock
swung between two wild custard-apple trees
when something caused me to suddenly open
my eyes. I caught just one flash of a black
body shoot out of view above my head and
tire next second Snowdrop was dancing fren-
ziedly in front of me, gripping a wriggling
black snake immediately below its venom-
ous open jaws. Snowdrop killed the long
beast scientifically and roasted the flesh for
tucker. About a week later he referred to
the subject. “I say you boss,” he observed
critically, “you not mindit hell of a big
black snake behind you ; why you priten of
poor blackphella?”

“Bill Hooks”: If “Speero” (B. 7/11/’2Sj
will go to the Book Out on the Oaks-Yerran-
derie-road and look down into the Nattai
Valley, he will see Terrible Hollow: My
father often entertained us kiddies with
stories of the Hollow and of confederates of
Ben Hall, who lived in this valley.
“Delta”: Tell “Speero” (B. 7/11/’2B that
Terrible Hollow is situated at the Aber-
crombie Caves, on the Batlmrst-Tuena road.
If “Speero” takes a trip to the caves, m
company with “Robbery Under Arms, he
can trace the geographical details —the pre-
cipitous path, the creek bed, and under the
arch of the. cave to the Hollow behind.
* * *
“Bill R.”: “M. Brio” (B. 7/11/’2B) says
it has been convincingly established that the
immature ’roo, an inch long and with
developed limbs, is bprn and attaches itself
to its mother’s teat. Dr. T. T. Flynn’s
theory to that effect might convince M.
Brio,” but will be smiled at by every fur-
hunter and bush expert in Australia. Every
kangaroo-skinner knows definitely that the
embryo frequently is found attached to the
teat, quite shapeless and resembling a wart
the size of a pea. When detached it presents
a small round aperture at the point of con-
tact, from which a trace of blood exudes.

“Hamer”: A Darlingliurst resident who
keeps prize pigeons lost one of a particularly
valued pair in a recent gale which blew the
roof of the cage off. The hen bird, rising
out of the shelter of surrounding walls into
a fiercer gale, was swept away. Hubby re-
mained and did double shifts on the eggs his
mate had deserted, but after three days he
took the opportunity of. an open 'cage to say
good-bye also. The breeder found cause for
rejoicing when the pigeon came back 36 hours
later, bringing bis mate with him. Is the
male’s homing sense keener than the female’s,
that the hen did not return until the male
bird went to fetch her? Or was his long
absence due to the fact that he had to expend
a lot of time in expostulation before he
could get an erring wife away from a
feathered co-re?
“Cop”: Do birds understand each other?
We have a galah who, besides being able
to talk, acquired the habit of opening his
cage whenever he wanted to get out. This
meant that liis cage had to be placed with
the door against a wall to prevent his escape.
Lately we brought a king parrot and housed
him in a cage alongside the galah. He
THE WIDOW’S MITE.
MRS. HOGAN: “It’s a quare taste ye have, Mrs. Wilkins, to kape a hob-nailed boot on
your mantelpiece.”
MRS. WILKINS: “It’s all I got lejt of Wilkins. And ’tis a comfort to go up to it and
put me tongue out, and say, ‘Kick me now, ye old devil!'"
seemed rather restless in his new home, and
one day the galali obligingly opened the cage
door for the king parrot to escape. Three
days later the parrot returned and brought
with him another of the same species. As
these birds are only seen, on the Western
plains, it is a problem where the other one
came from. Anyhow, they both seem happy
in their cage, and the galah looks on with
the air of a successful matchmaker.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad” : It’s surprising what a little
thing will sometimes retrieve an apparently
hopeless situation. Just south of Tutu
Island we ran our lugger on a reef, bhe
swung amidsmps, and we
could feel her timbers
trembling with every
ripple of the outgoing
tide. In an hour, at the
least, it seemed a cer-
tainty that her own
weight must break her
back. We ran an anchor
out astern, and set the
, boys to the winch, but
their utmost efforts only
made the lugger shiver
slightly to the strain of
the chain. We had a
crowd of natives aboard,
bound for a mission
station. My frantic mate
ran them to the stern,
and set the whole mob
jumping upon the deck in
unison while he beat time.
We felt the lugger quiver,
and heard the coral under-
neath her grinding men-
acingly. The crew
strained at the winch, the
natives jumped and howled
with redoubled energy,
and inch by inch the lug-
ger began to slip back
towards the deep water.
The jumpers were becom-
ing exhausted when the
vessel’s weight began to tell in our favor,
and she went in a slow, crunching glide, slip-
ping back into the sea like a thankful
whale.
■j. * * *
“Bad Australian”: Some years ago I
caught a young wedge-tailed eagle that was
just learning to fly and took him home and
reared him. By the time he was full grown
he had developed such predatory habits that
I was forced to keep him tied up. A pair
of bantams with a clutch of chickens were
running in the same yard, and one aay an
unwary chick got a bit too close and the
eagle promptly grabbed him,, whereupon the
rooster waded into the big bird as if he just
loved the job. Handicapped with about five
or six feet of dog-chain, Wedge-tail, made a
very poor showing against the active little
rooster, who outed him in the sixth round
by driving a spur into one of his eyes and
half-way through his head.
“Billy See”: We were travelling through
the bus’ll in a pretty dry part of W.A. when
my mate suddenly spotted a big* wide-
spreading salmon-gum. “Here’s a chance, to
fill our water-bags,” he said. Searching
around the tree-trunk he soon found a wooden
plug which, on being pulled out, liberated a
stream of nice cool water. “Biuglii’s reser-
voir,’’ my' mate explained. Examining the
tree carefully, I found that the trunk was
hollow, and had been carefully caulked with
stiff clay, while down the upper side of
every branch a deep groove had been cut.
When it rained water was collected from
all over the tree and conducted to the reser-
voir, where it was held safe from evapora-
tion and thirsty animals. Binglii grudged
no traveller a drink from his fountain, but
it was an unpardonable offence to neglect
to replace the plug.
* * * *
“Esmond”: A young prospector named
Jackson at Fox’s Find (W.A.) was examin-
ing a rabbit trap when he was bitten on the
little finger of the left hand by a tiger-
snake. Having nothing with ’ which to
scarify the wound he promptly put the in-
jured finger to the muzzle of his gun and
blew it off. Then he walked back to his
camp, got his mate to apply bandages, and
the pair set off on foot for Boulder, 15
miles distant. On the way they met a motor-
truck. which gave them a lift to the hospital,
where Jackson received expert treatment.
He is now reported to be well, and the
medico who operated on the finger is of the
opinion that Jackson’s promptness with the
gun saved his life.
* * * *
“P.X.”: How much does cocky know?
This chap, one of the big white yellow-
crested variety, has been in the family for
five or six years, and has acquired consider-
able liberty. Though he has lived most of
his time in a cage, he has been allowed out
pretty often for a walk round. The other
day, feeling his wings when thus freed, he
flew off, and all efforts to locate him were
vain: he had got away into the bush that
surrounds his home suburb. Three cold
nights he was adrift; then he found his
way home —hungry, scrawny and bedraggled.
He" was fed and fussed over, and at last
shown the cage. Without a moment’s hesita-
tion he flew to it and pushed his way in; and
now he simply won’t come out. When his
mistress tries to lift him out in order to
clean the prison, he resists with beak and
claw. He has got his bars back, and he
isn’t going to take any more chances of
losing them.

“Pickax”: “Gemem’s” Madang archers
(B. 14/11/’2B) were an exception to the
rule. Prom my experience of New Guinea
archers I would say that they are rotten
shots'. Their arrows are crude; too long; too
light at the forward end, and, being un-
feathered, most erratic at ranges of 80 to
!)0 yards. Not long ago in the Papuan
hinterland my assistant on a Government
patrol shortened, weighted and feathered
some arrows, and, using them in the shortest
bow he could find, outshot all the old-
timers. They were not in the least amazed,
and, although grudgingly admitting their
defeat, took not the slightest interest in
the arrow alterations.
* * * *
“Emmak”: Recently shared some grub
and smoke with a swaggie on the Yanko, and
next day he gave me two fine 51b. cod. "I got
plenty for meself, too,” he said. Not having
much luck in that line myself, I asked
what bait he used. He said he got a small
spotted or black frog, tied it with cotton with
its back to the back of a double hook, leaving
the legs free to move. A very light sinker
was used, just heavy enough to hear hook and
bait toward the bottom. If there were no
bites, you didn’t leave your frog to drown,
hut hauled him up for air now and again.
Under proper management, said swaggie, the
frog would last a long time.
* * * *
“Hayband”: “Eureka” (B. 21/11/’2B) on
snakebite and finger-lopping reminds me of
a curious incident near Numurkah (Vic.).
An axeman had been nipped. Almost
instantly he pruned the finger-topi and
cleared for the town. An hour or two later
his brother went out to finish the job. Notic-
ing the piece of finger clustered with ants,
lie picked it up. An ant or two bit him,
but he took no notice. It wasn’t till he
began to feel deadly sick that he divined that
he had been bitten by proxy, as it were.
Shortly afterwards the local doctor was treat-
ing hiin for snakebite. Both brothers recov-
ered.
* * * *
“Emmak”: Brown and Jones were fishing.
Brown had a license; Jones hadn’t. After
bagging a few they spotted the bailiff in the
distance on horseback. A short parley, and
Brown made off as fast as he could. sprint,
but Jones kept on fishing. Mr. Bailiff set
sail after the fugitive Brown, overhauled him
and demanded liis license. Brown fumbled
in all his pockets, with one eye cocked to-
wards Jones, who by then was nearly out of
sight. Eventually Brown found his license,
and the bailiff, seeing it was right, asked
why Brown had run away. “I thought you
might be Ned Kelly or a razor artist,” was
the meek reply. Then the bailiff set off to
hunt for Jones; but he didn’t find him.
“Toonooba”: That the Australian abori-
ginal is black is a wide-spread misconcep-
tion. The English description, “They are
not really black, but of a dark chocolate
color,” quoted and questioned by “Oxmead’
(B. 14/11/’2B), is sufficiently accurate for
ordinary purposes. Whilst investigating the
skin-color of the Kamilaroi tribe and others
of Nor’-West N.S.W., I was surprised to find
that the skin-color of the full-blood men was,
in nearly every case, red-brown. The women
were appreciably lighter and were classed
Indian-red. The skin-tints were taken in
every case on the inner side of the upper
arm. Broca's scale was used. This con-
sists of eight plates, each of four tints, rang-

ing from pale-ochre, through red-ochre, red-
brown, greys to black, and is the standard
for such investigations. In the case of only
one man was the color chocolate-brown. The
black and grey-black tints found in certain
of the African tribes were not in evidence
in any case.
* * * *
“Cobar”: Very few students of bird life
will agree with “Murkali” (B. 14/11/’2B)
that the magpie is not a migrant. Le Souef,
the bird authority, maintains that the magpie
is as inconstant to his abode as a flatite,
shifting long distances at frequent intervals.
Laughing Jack is commonly acknowledged to
be the home-lover of the family, very few, if
any, moving far away from their birth-
place. Probably, as “Murwah” suggests, his
magpie does not move far for the same
reason as “Murkah” keeps his present job—
he knows where the tucker comes from.
* * * *
“Crowstoner”: I lived in crow country for
many years, and, like “M.M.E.” (B.
21/H/’2B) was long puzzled oyer their
housing arrangements. In the first place
crows build their nests near water. Having
found water, you have every chance of finding
a crow’s residential if you shin up the tree
with the heaviest foliage. The birds select
this type of tree to shield them from hot
westerlies and blazing sunsets. But you
won’t see the nest if you don’t take a gas-
helmet with you. A fact not generally known
about crows is that in parenthood they emit
an acrid vapor sufficiently dense to make their
bedroom invisible. The vapor causes both
eyes and nose to run; hence the need for a
gas-mask.
* # $ *
“Jacques P.”: The modern Papuan who
believes in tailed men doesn’t beat the
ancient European in the matter of cre-
dulity. Tyson, a seventeenth-century medico,
wrote an account of “Monstrous Sorts
of Men,” mainly taken from Strabo. He
described men who have no noses; men with
one eye in the middle of the forehead, dog’s
ears, and erect hair ; men who live for a
thousand years; men who have eyes in their
breasts, and men who have only one leg, and
lie on their backs, shielding their bodies
from the sun with their single hind limbi But
the nicest folk in the list are the Astomoi,
who have no mouths —“a civil sort of people
that live about the head of the Ganges and
live upon smelling to boiled meals and the
odors of fruits and flowers; they can bear
no ill-scent, and therefore cannot live in a
camp.”
“Maunga”: Does “Fisherman” seriously
contend (B. 31/10/’2S) that he has
solved the mystery of the Maoriland white-
bait with his theory that they become the
inanga? When whitebait are running they
pass up the river in untold millions, whereas
the inanga is comparatively rare.
* * * *
“Pick”: “Duckwing” (B 1.4/11/’2B) and
other recent pars, re cockfighting would make
it appear that the debarred sport is now
unknown in Australia. I know at least one
N.S.W, South Coast village where every
Sunday morning leading residents hie out of
town, many with a concealed game rooster
in their keeping*. I know them to be a
betting fraternity, and I am satisfied that
they do not take the birds to church. Also,
by the bedraggled appearance of their long-
legged charges when they return, I am
prompted to the belief that they have not
been out merely to view the scenery.
* * * *
“Sylvester” : “Spadger’s” tree that yielded
260 posts (B. 14/11/’2B) would be
used for a pot-plant at Kin Kin, Q’land.
There the giant kauri pine (Agathis robusta)
flourishes in the dense vine scrubs, though
on account of its commercial value it will
soon be a thing of the past. One that was re-
served by the Lands Department was blown
down, and when removed contained 13,000
feet of millable timber, and much better
sticks were brought to Cooran in the early
days. On the forest slopes there also grows
one of Australia’s premier hardwoods, known
as messmate. I have taped one 32 feet in
circumference and many must be over 40
feet. They have a tremendous length of
trunk straight as a gun-barrel'. This tree is
far superior to the N.S.W. messmate.

“Hayband”: The oddest weapon I’ve seen
used against a shark was a stockwhip. A
horse during swimming exercise on a New-
castle beach suddenly screamed, and it was
seen that a shark was at him. The animal
struggled inshore, but the terror hung on.
Instantly a good stockwhip-hand spurred liis
mount into the water and commenced to flail
the fish. But it wasn’t till the whizzing lash
tore an eye from its socket that the shark
released his grip. The horse recovered, but
could never again be persuaded to enter the
water. Previously he had been fond of it.
HOUSES’ HOOFS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Horses’ hoofs that are making home,
Clicketty-clack of the newly-shod,
Broad, blunt hoofs in the yielding loam
When the lark is breaking its heart to God,
Breaking its heart for the joy of things
That only the lark knows when he sings.
Horses’ hoofs on the lone bush trail,
Busy hoofs that are tired now,
The roofs of the valley huts gleam pale,
The red sun faints on the mountain’s brow,
Coming home at the end of day
From the mustering camp that is miles away.
Horses’ hoofs on a city street
(Too slow they seem to the rubber wheels
Where the motor-cars are so thick and fleet)
As though they beat on a heart that feels
A memory stirring of long ago
When they took the road to the country
show.
The mealy dust by the sapling grove,
The four-in-hand and the wliip-lash shrill,
Or a sodden dip where the waggon strove
And the harness strained as we climbed
the hill,
When the rising river was dark as mud
And the gums were islands amidst the flood.
Horses jogging behind the stock!
Dry as a bone is the land to-day.
There’s a low complaint from the travelling
flock
And the grass is brittle and poor as hay:
And over there where horizons reel
The earth is cracking, the skies are steel.
Horses! I love their racing feet!
On the old bush trails—or at Flcmington,
The hurrying force of that merry beat,
When the bookies shout and the odds
are on;
The breathless wait, then the sighing hush;
The signal given—the forward rush.
The tense, white minute; the ringing cheer
From a thousand throats, like a trumpet
call;
Down the straight now the jockeys steer,
Flash of color, a whip’s light fall,
The close-clenched fingers, the prayer to win.
Chance is a coin that the vain gods spin.
Daintily stepping by tower and mead,
Was ever a burden half as fair?
Pearl-caparisoned was the steed,
But the girl wore only her long bright
hair;
Shafts of sunlight on shadows blue
And shuttered windows as she rides through.
Knights of Malta with courage high ;
English kings on a bloody field;
A screaming mare and a bannered sky,
And a Roman soldier upon his shield.
Wraiths that fought for a queen—a gem—
The wild war-stallions keep pace with them!
DAD HOLDING HIS END UP, TOO.
“Arty, baby’s got a tooth in the front!”
“That’s nothing. I’ve just ’ad two at the corner!”
Horses’ hoofs down the path of years,
Battle charger or lady’s hack,
I cannot see you sometimes for tears,
For so well I know you will not come back,
Shelved by the mile-a-minute things,
Dear ghosts that lived in forgotten springs .
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.

Origin and significance of the old blue
willow pattern on china? —7472.
Willow pattern proper Avas first made in
Caughley, Shropshire, about 1780; it was
apparently a design by Turner, the potter,
inspired by tie decoration on Chinese porcelain
imported to Europe in the eighteenth century.
The willow has long been used by Chinese
artists in their landscapes, but there is no
evidence that it ever had any legendary or
emblematic significance. After Turner prac-
tically every potter of note in England copied
the design, and connected with it is a long
story of a cruel father, a rich suitor and
thwarted lovers ; but it is more than pro-
bable that the story has no Chinese origin.
I am doing social and other committee re-
ports for a Sydney suburban newspaper.
What is the award rate for this class of
ivork? —77B2.
There is no award for suburban papers.
Method of cutting and polishing malachite?
—7697.
It is scarcely a job for an amateur. The
dull or dead parts are first chiselled; then
they are rasped and filed with a triangular
scraper and smoothed with fish-skin or glass
paper. Soft and very fine sandstone is next
applied with water while the malachite is in
quick revolution, so that a body of mud is
worked up. This sludge is worked well in
with a wet rag, after which it is washed off,
putty powder and water being applied on
a rag until there is a gloss. The thing is
finished with a mixture of putty powder and
soap and water on a rag and wiped dry.
How to make boiled lollies? —7679.
Boiled sweets are made from cane sugar
and water boiled until a small quantity
dropped into cold water will set hard. Flavor-
ings and colorings are added to the hot mix-
ture, and different shapes are obtained by
pouring it into oiled moulds. For large quan-
tities of attractive sweets, considerable plant
and gear and a Beaume saccharometer are
required; experience also is necessary to
temperatures and boilino- time

Yes, provided the contractors do not sub-

Food placed in our ice-chest soon gets a
mouldy taste: what’s wrong?—' 7sB3.
Possibly the chest is kept in a damp, un-
suitable position ; if not, the insulation must
be faulty. If it has vacuum insulation,
breaks or cracks may have occurred to admit
damp air and water, in which case the chest
is useless. If the insulation is sawdust, and
it has become exposed to leaking water or
other damp, its consequent mouldiness would
account for the condition of the food.. Com-
municate with the makers or the people from
whom you bought the chest about having it
re-insulated; meantime, try washing it well
with hot water and exposing the inside to
strong sunlight for several hours, protecting
the woodwork from the sun as much as pos-
sible.

For two years Ug> healthy-looking tomato
plants grown here (N.Q.) have home no
fruit. What’s the trouble? —764s.
If plants and fruit are free from disease,
the only explanation is deficiency in the
soil. The ground should be well worked up
and fertilised with a commercial fertiliser
containing at least 10 p.c. of potash.
Mow to make ice-cream? —-7722.
Take 1 pint cream, £-pint milk, 6 eggs
(yolks only), lib. sifted sugar, 2 teaspoonfuls

Any information? —7727.
First decide on the number of tables you
will provide; four or five should be enough
for a small party. Invite guests by card,
letter or telephone; acceptances must be re-
ceived from at least 16 or 20. On arrival
each guest should receive a large card with
his or her name on it, marked with a letter
or symbol denoting the table at which he is
to play. The players should take their places
at their respective tables, cut for partners,
deal and proceed in the usual way. As soon
as a rubber is finished the winners should
move on to the next table and separate (that
is. each plays with a different partner) ; but
before leaving the table each player adds up
the number of points he has won, without
subtracting those won by the opponents;
this score is then submitted to one of the
opponents, who checks it. and after it has
been entered on the player’s score-card,
initials as correct. After each rubber the
winners move on to the next table, as already
described., till each has played 16 or 20 rub-
bers. The number of points won by each
player is then added up, the one scoring
the highest receiving first prize ; second and
third prizes may be given at the option of the
hostess. Before play is begun it should be
decided and announced whether the bidding
is to be “value” or “majority,” and whether
all the honors shall be counted, or only
four in one hand.

pay after 21 months’ service in the Terri-
tory. (4) Cadets are given a course of
instruction in the various departments at
Rabaul and then drafted out to district
officers for work in the field. In effect, they
are trained for positions in district estab-
lishments, their duties being concerned with
the extension of Government influence
among the natives and with the administra-
tion of the areas already brought under
Government control. (5) Home and Terri-
tories Department, Canberra.
(1) Where can I get information about
N.S.W. Institute of Actuaries’ exams? (2)

How to poison mice in a hayloft? —73B3.
A bait that can be recommended: Barium
carbonate (8oz.), oatmeal (10oz.), beef drip-
ping (8oz.), salt (ioz.). Make into a dough,
roll out and cut into half-inch cubes and
place in the infested area. Smaller quanti-
ties can be made.
A method of making parchment? Gan it
be made from goatskins? —7sl3.
Parchment may be made from skins, includ-
ing those of goats, by the following method:
Soak skin or skins for several days in a
solution of lime and water, and remove hair
by shaving with a sharp hnife. Then nail
the skin tightly, flesh-side outwards, on a
board and remove the rough and fleshy parts
with a close-set spokeshave and a steel
scraper. Next sprinkle skin with chalk and
rub it down with smooth pumice until smooth
itself, the refuse being washed off. Then
let it dry, after which it may be again rubbed
down with smooth pumice. It should now be
taken off the board and again nailed on, but
with the other, side outwards, the roughness
being smoothed out with pumice. The skin
should finally be removed and worked back-
wards and forwards over a round piece, of
wood until it becomes supple.
Where can I get a plan of my N.S.W.
farm, and what would it cost? —76l9.
If farm is held under one .of the Crown
land tenures, from the Lands Dept., Sydney ;
without particulars of the area, cost cannot
be given. If you are a freeholder you would
have to engage a surveyor.
A method of keeping pumpkins in bulk
through the winter for sale in late spring;
also the best types for storing? —76l.
The chief factor controlling the keeping
quality of pumpkins is maturity when har-
vested. They should never be lifted until
thoroughly mature; lifted immature, they
will rot after frost. Pumpkins desired to be
kept should be specially selected and have
portion of the stalk adhering. Before stack-
ing see that no bruised or immature ones are
included and that they are dry, and store
in a dry, well ventilated position. The various
selections of ironbark grown on the Hawkes-
bury are good keepers. A Queensland variety,
Beaudesert. is also worthy of trial.
(1) How many Commonwealth Senators
are there? (2) Does the number of Senators
increase according to increase in population,
or is it the number of Representatives that
increases with population? —7699.
(1) Thirty-six—six for each State. (2) No
State may have more than six Senators, and
each must have at least five Representatives;
but when the population warrants it
increased membership in the House of
Reps, is granted under section 24 of the
Constitution. This provides that “(a) a
quota shall be ascertained by dividing the
number of the people of the Commonwealth,
as shown by the latest statistics, by twice
the number of the Senators. ( b) The number
of members to be chosen in each State shall
be determined by dividing the number of the
people of the State by the quota; and if
on such division there is a remainder greater
than one-hair of the qqota, one more member
shall be chosen in the State.”

Why be satisfied with less?
SHARE in the benefits that P. & C. Assurance brings ! When times
are hazardous the company keeps policies in force ; a definite
sum is set aside each year for loan purposes. P. &C. policies
are planned to meet the special needs of the man on the land—these
are the things that have resulted from the co-operative basis of the
P. &C. The further fact that the company is linked with the most
influential co-operative bodies in the Commonwealth is yet another
factor in the stability of the company. When such advantages can
be obtained at no extra cost, why be satisfied with less ?

P HOS PH ATI C FERTI LI SERS.
“Hatter”: Phosphates rank next to nitro-
gen as the most important element of plant
food. Australia possesses no deposits of
natural rock phosphates similar to those
found in Europe and America, and in con-
sequence there is a relatively small propor-
tion in Australian soils. The production of
milk, bones and the grain of cereals makes
a continuous demand on the phosphates in
the soil in addition to the demand of ordi-
nary plant growth. Every 10 gallons of
milk contains not less than lib. phosphate of
lime, 57 per cent, of the bones of animals
consist of the same, and 91 per cent, of a
grain of wheat is phosphates. In virgin
soils a supply of phosphates has been stored
up by nature, and a first crop can be
secured with little cultivation, but a good
crop will exhaust the natural phosphates in
six months.
Phosphates may be used in four forms :
(1) The mono-basic or acid phosphates
(1 part phosphoric acid to 1 part lime), com-
mercially known as superphosphate, which
is soluble in water. In this fertiliser the
lime is in the form of gypsum, a sulphate
of lime, which is not soluble in the carbonic-
acid water of the soil and is of little prac-
tical advantage,
(2) The di-basic or “reverted” phosphate,
soluble in citrate of ammonia and carbonic-
acid water.
(3) The tri-basic phosphate, soluble in
carbonic-acid water and sold as bones, plios-
pliatic guano and rock phosphate.
(4) The tetra-basic phosphate, soluble in
citrate of ammonia and carbonic-acid water,
and sold as Thomas’s phosphate or basic
slag.
In the order of solubility in the soil they
rank as follows: Super., Thomas’s phosphate,
reverted phosphate, phosphatic guano, bone-
meal. rock phosphate, fine bouedust and
coarse bonedust. Useful quantities of car-
bonate of lime are present in bonemeal and
phosphatic guano, and of free lime in
Thomas’s phosphate.
In selecting fertilisers the rainfall, growth
period of the crop and type of soil must be
taken into account. For cereals on a loamy
soil phosphatic guano will give good results
with an average rainfall of 30 inches and
over. On stiff soils, poor in humus, 40
inches of rain would be needed. With a
rainfall of 20-30 inches Thomas’s phosphate
would be suitable on a loamy soil. Under
20 inches, super, should be sown with the
seed on any but a calcareous soil, but the
fallow or previous crop should have been
dressed with a phosphatic manure contain-
ing lime, because the presence of lime causes
a certain proportion of the water-soluble
phosphates to revert to the di-basic form,
soluble in dilute acid, which renders it slower
in action and less liable to be lost through
leaching.
The quantity of fertiliser used on the fal-
low should be proportionate to the crop
expected. Forty bushels of wheat per acre
requires 3cwt. of basic slag or phosphatic
guano, with 4cwt. super, at seeding. Lesser
yields require correspondingly less.
Super, is a most valuable fertiliser when
used in moderate quantities and in conjunc-
tion with others, but its use as a complete
manure in large quantities is doing incalcu-
lable harm in many districts. It acts prin-
cipally as a stimulant and helps the young
plant to get a good start and overcome the
weeds. It is particularly useful for quick-
growing crops like maize and roots, and
should always be sown with them in moder-
ate amounts, but its effect is lost from the
soil long before the period when it is most
needed by, cereals —when they are coming
into head. Plants, like animals, need feed-
ing throughout the whole period of their
growth. The application of super, alone in
quantities exceeding |cwt. provides a prodi-
gal feast for the first two or three months,
but unless the soil is naturally fertile or
unless much of the super, has “reverted,”
a famine is bound to follow. Feeding off the
crop by sheep when several inches high is
equivalent to a top-dressing of nitrate of
soda, but contributes nothing in the way of
phosphates.
PAINT ON THE FARM.
Like The Bulletin’s Service Department
the N.'S.W. Agricultural Department receives
so many inquiries about whitewash and the
painting of asbestos sheets that it lately got
its experts to put their conclusions in writ-
ing. It is inadvisable, they think, to apply
ordinary paint while the sheets are new and
not specially prepared for the job. It is
better to allow the sheets to weather for
about 12 months and then apply a coat of
equal parts of genuine turpentine and hard
oak varnish. If to this a coat of paint con-
sisting of one part of red lead to three parts
of titanium zinc is applied, a first-class
foundation will be provided for further
painting.
In the case of internal surfaces, a coat
of preparatory liquid will pave the way fox-
one or two coats of cold-water paint, or
the even more pleasing fiat oil paint, many
attractive shades of which are now available.
Cold-water paint may be applied externally
in lieu of oil paint if desired. For this pur-
pose it will be necessary to add about one
quarter of a pint of raw linseed oil to the
gallon of water paint.
For ceilings kalsomine is recommended in
lieu of cold-water paint. Guttering, down-
pipes, etc., are usually painted for appear-
ance immediately the building is completed.
It is better not to paint the roof iron, too,
until it has been exposed to the weather for
a few years. Because of the continual con-
traction and expansion due to the extremes
of heat and cold, and the want of a good
grip or key, ordinary house paint not
suitable. It is always advisable to use a
high-grade paint specially manufactured for
the purpose.
For whitewash obtain, if possible, large
pieces of fresh lump lime, place them in a
very large bucket or other suitable con-
tainer and into this pour hot water. Cold
water will do, but hot water is better, as
it hastens the slaking. The lime will start
to boil and break up. Keep it covered all
the time with about half an inch of water*.
This is important, for if whilst the lime
is slaking it is allowed to rise up above the
water in a dry powder it will “curdle,” a con-
dition tolerated only by inexperienced and
indifferent workmen. Before the lime com-
mences to boil fiercely add tallow or common
fat in the proportion of about lib. to 141 b.
of lump lime. This makes a good binder,
which will prevent the wash from rubbing off.
If desired, a little yellow ochre may also
be added, which will give a cream or buff
tint according to the quantity used. When
the lime is thoroughly slaked, it should be
stirred and rufficient water added to make
it a little heavier than, say, milk,'after which
it should be strained.
BEWARE OF EROSION.
“‘L’Fou” : There is a moral for landholders
in a problem now confronting Oxley (Vic.)
Shire Council. Four years ago flood waters
left a log in the bed of the King River two
miles above a bridge. Stones and other
debris were washed down and banked against
this till a sufficient wall was formed
to divert the water into a drain from a neigh-
boring hop-fidd. To-day the bridge, a modern
concrete structure costing £l5OO, stands use-
less over a dry water-course. The river is
flowing over rich flats, and has destroyed a
large portion of new road. It is expected
that it will cost £2OO to return the water to
its original channel. In the beginning half
a day’s work would have shifted the log and
kept the stream in its old channel.
Erosion takes toll of good land each year,
and a considerable percentage of this might
be saved if reasonable care were exercised.
It is a good plan to make a survey of all
water-coux-ses on your property at the begin-
ning: of winter. They may be only miniature
affairs or they may be bone-dry, but they
can cause damaging wasliaways. Study the
lay of the land, and put in a few days
straightening old channels. A load of stones
and a few 7 logs at the right place may save
half an acre of land. Think twice before
you disturb the natural vegetation on a
creek’s banks. Probably a crop of trees can
be grown there more profitably than any-
thing else. For holding up broken banks
willow is as good as anything; and it has
grazing A r alue. If old trees are available
from which large limbs may be lopped, tree-
guards wall not be necessary. Buffalo, couch
and grasses of such matting habits, too, are
great soil-savers along a creek-bed.
A NEW WHEAT PEST?
“Bii-o”: A fly hitherto unknown to us has
caused considerable damage to wheat crops in
Western N.S.W. this season. The damage is
done by the larvae, and affected wheat
has sometimes been thought to have been
attacked by “foot-rot.” Districts where
quail are very numerous are free from the
pest.
WINDBREAKS ON THE FARM.
“Eureka": On many farms the land has
been so thoroughly cleared of timber that
there is little or no shelter for the cattle.
The few remaining trees are tall with bushy
tops, but provide very little shade and no
protection from wind or rain. In each pad-
dock low. bushy trees with foliage right
down to the ground should be planted. Care
should be exercised in selecting a location
for these wind- and weather-breaks, because
cattle are strange animals and will suffer
untold discomfort rather than camp on cer-
tain areas. A good plan is to erect the
windbreaks at the spots where the cattle are
used to camping, running a line of trees
north and south and another east and west
in such a manner as to form a cross, so
that the cattle can shelter from any wind.
The result of this comfort in the case of
dairy cows will be reflected in the extra
amount of milk they will give in bad weather
and their good condition. In bad weather
shelter is as important as feed.
THE COW-COCKY AND 11.C.L.
“P.M.” : “Melos” tells me cow-cockies can’t
pick up half their living on the farm. Here
are some facts. For four years on a dairy-
farm my household expenses came to just
under £lOO per annum. During the next
three years, on wages, I averaged £235 per
annum, and found it impossible to save. We
lived at the same rate practically, except
that I had to dress a little better. You
can’t go to work in a six-bob pair of dun-
garees with the seat patched, such as you
wear in the cowyard. “Melos” says he
doesn’t gossip with his neighbors, and then
says he carts his cream a mile out to the
stand. I have seen enough time wasted hang-
ing around cream-stands yarning to cut half
the bracken-ferns in Gippsland.
As for the cockies’ consumption of butter
being small, I know better. For 18 months
I wrapped up and labelled butter-parcels in
a factory which had 320 suppliers, and my
experience was that the suppliers used more
than the townspeople. The cocky gets it 4d.
cheaper than the retail rate, and if he
churns it himself he saves another 4d. or sd.
per lb. Rising at 3 a.m. is a ridiculous
exaggeration. I have lived among dairymen
for a good few years, and I am satisfied not
more than 5 per cent, of them get up before
5 a.m., and that only in summer.
CLEANLINESS IN THE DAIRY.
“Butterfat”: Every cow-cocky knows, or
should know by this time, that absolute clean-
liness of all utensils that come in contact
with the milk is a first essential to the output
of best-quality cream, but there are a good
many of them who do not know how to effec-
tively remove all trace of milk. A thorough
sluicing with boiling water containing wash-
ing-soda appears as if it ought to do the trick,
but it won’t. For very much the same reason
that the housewife washes utensils that have
held eggs in cold water first, the first wash
should be with cold or luke-warm water; the
second wit-h hot water containing a small
quantity of washing-soda ; the third with boil-
ing water containing no soda.
It is essential to dismantle and cleanse the
vacuum tank of the milking-machine, and to
make sure that the inside of the milk rubbers
is thoroughly cleansed. The boiling-water
treatment is necessary to kill germs, remove
all traces of soda and to ensure quick drying,
which wards off corrosion and rust.
SIDE-BONES.
“Spike” : Side-bones, a disease of the horse,
is so named because they appear on the side
of the foot. Heavy horses are far more
prone to the complaint than the lighter
breeds, and it is more frequently developed
in fore feet than in hind feet. The seat of
the complaint is the lateral cartilage, two
strong bands of fibro cartilage surrounding
the wings of the os pedis, which by virtue of
their elasticity assist the frog and soft
structures of the foot to regain their natural
position after being thrust upward and out-
ward by the weight of the animal. This car-
tilage becomes ossified, the foot loses its
natural spring and the animal becomes stiff
in its gait. Although the complaint is very
prevalent, most horse-users appear to know .
very little about it.
The ossification is gradual, but as the
trouble progresses it is easily diagnosed by
placing a forefinger and thumb on the wings
of the os pedis and gently pressing and releas-
ing. If there is a distinct give and a result-
ant spring back the foot is sound so far
as the lateral cartilage is concerned. Should
the os pedis be impervious to pressure, the
ossification is complete and the side-bones
are very obvious.
The disease, though it stiffens the gait and
makes a horse slower, does not incapacitate it
for work. Many farmers refuse to buy any
animal which shows the least sign of a
side-bone, but a good sort with a side-bone or
two purchased at a reasonable price is a lot
better proposition than a brace of sound
squibs or jibs.
CATTLE IN THE FAR NORTH.
“W.M.8.”: “Wingella” (B. 14/11/’2B)
says Brahmin (zebu) cattle can be found in
thousands in the Northern Territory, running
wild all over Arnhem Land, and avers that
most of the cattle bred in the North have a
good deal of Brahmin blood in them, and so
stand up to sandflies, ticks and abnormal sea-
sons with impunity. Unfortunately that is
not the case.
A small herd of zebus, two bulls and 10
cows, was imported from India by the Cable
Company at Darwin. They became wild, and
established themselves on the Adelaide River
and crossed witli the Ilerefords; but the
strain has long since died out, and the hump
and other characteristics have entirely dis-
appeared. There is very little zebu blood in
the stock in Arnhem Land now ; but there
should be, because this is the animal most
suitable to the climate. Wherever the British
have settled in tropical regions the invariable
mistake has been made of trying to intro-
duce European cattle in place of those speci-
ally prepared by nature for such countries,
or of a suitable blend of the tropical and
European species.
It is a case of the survival of the fittest in
Arnhem Land. Both the zebu and swamp-
buffalo thrive and multiply there, while Euro-
pean stock have perished in tens of thou-
sands. Rcdwater was the primary cause, but
the buffalo-fly, which drives cattle and horses
to frenzy, has done its share. Numerous other
stinging pests combine to make Arnhem
Land quite unsuitable for European stock.
From a parent herd of 12 cows and two
bulls the buffalo have increased in the North
to over 300,000 in 120 years without deterior-
ating through inbreeding. This is a suf-
ficiently significant result in a land where
everything else has failed. Cecil Frere made
over £lOOO last year out of buffalo hides;
E. O. Robinson cleared £lOOO a year on Mel-
ville Island from the same source; and to-
day Vestcy Bros, are exporting young buffalo
from Darwin to Manila and raising buffalo
stock on commercial lines.
The European cattle only exist in such a
climate. They do not multiply and become
an asset to the country. They cannot with-
stand the trying influences of great heat and
prolonged exposure to strong sunlight, from
which, and from the numerous flies and other
pests, as well as the diseases of tropical cli-
mates, they suffer great misery and die in
large quantities. The zebu’s power of resist-
ing heat, sunlight, etc., is doubtless in a
great measure due to the fact that, while its
hair may be white or grey, its skin is black.
If Arnhem Land is ever to be profitably
developed Australia will have to get away
from the idea that a tropical country can
be treated as if it were in the temperate
zone. In Texas (U.S.A.) similar conditions
to those in Arnhem Land prevail. European
cattle would not thrive there. Consequently
in 1906 one of the cattle-breeders —A. 11.I 1 .
Border—carefully selected in India 46 bulls
and five heifers from five of the largest and
finest zebu breeds. These were mated with
scrub cows, high-grade Shorthorns and Here-
fords and cows with a slight strain of zebu
blood in them. The crosses have been so
successful that to-day they are the established
breeds of the country.
This blending of stock to suit a climate
has also been done with the utmost success
in the Charters Towers (Q.) district and
Fiji.
DROUGHT REPLACEMENTS.
“G.G.6” : Central and N.-W. Q’land sheep-
men are speculating on what they will have
to pay for store sheep to replace those lost
in the drought when conditions improve to
the extent of justifying their purchase.
South Q’land, in spite of fair to good con-
ditions, will not be able to supply anything
like the quantity needed, and a large num-
ber will have to be bought from N.S.W.
breeders. On the one hand it is maintained
that the inquiry for stock consequent on the
recent rains will raise prices. On the other
it is expected that the difficulty of. obtain-
ing money which confronts the graziers hard
hit by the drought will militate against any
large business being done until southern
sellers moderate their prices. Sellers will
probably realise this, and reduce prices as
an alternative to compelling the buyers to
stand pat and restock by breeding up.
Already in N.S.W. some breeders have been
offering young ewes for forward delivery next
autumn, with lambs at foot, on four-months
bills, the sheep to be carried by the seller
until delivery, subject to agistment ' fees.
This wouTd give the buyer a chance of taking
delivery of suitably-priced sheep after the
Q’land rainy season, with lambs in addition.
The only catch in the scheme is the possible
continuance of the drought throughout the
summer of next year, but that is against the
probabilities.

Branches throughout the Commonwealth and at London
handling dead wool should wear gloves, as
sores on the hands are likely to become
poisoned through contact with wool that is
probably full of disease.
When the wool has been gathered, either
press it and send it straight away to the
brokers, or store it somewhere away from
the shearing-shed. The former is the better
plan, as the stench attracts flies and the
wool becomes a breeding ground.
If possible, arrange for the wool gatherers
to burn the carcases after plucking. If
wood is handy this is easily done, but if not,
get them to take a few tins of liquid disin-
fectant in the cart, and spray each carcase
liberally.
Dead wool being light and carrying no
condition brings good value, and the small
expense of collection is well repaid.
FENCING ACROSS CREEKS.
“Deejay”: Much time is lost repairing
fences over creeks after heavy rains have
sent down rubbish that has piled up and
broken the fence. A lot of trouble can be
avoided by sinking two posts on the banks
(well away from the brink if the soil is
likely to crumble away), the fence being sus-
pended from a wire rope made of twisted
strands of fencing-wire. The portion of the
fence dipping into the creek should be made
with a few saplings in it, some near the bot-
tom, and the bottom should be attached by
a wire to a few pegs. When the weight of
water and rubbish gets on to the fence the
pegs will pull out, and the whole structure
will rise and allow the rubbish to How
along. When the water falls the fence drops
again into"Y)osition, and later can be repegged
to prevent the stock from pushing through.
A couple of saplings or battens and a few
strands of plain wire will make a suitable
contrivance for a small stream.
Bigger creeks require a heavier structure.
The posts that hold the wire rope must be
well stayed and well strained back to the
next post. After a flood has left rubbish
on the wires of a fence go along with a stick
or fork and knock it off as soon as possible.
It is a harbor for white ants and a danger
in time of fires. If cleared off it dries and
soon blows away.
If the posts are out of line or pulled over,
straighten them when the ground is wet and
ram them later on. In fencing low country
subject to flooding always use a plain wire
on the bottom, as barbed wire will catch
and hold passing rubbish. In laying out new
paddocks, arrange as much of your fencing as
possible in the direction of the current. The
branches of scrub felled for fodder should be
either burnt or carted away, as they cause
trouble when the rain falls. They get into
the channels, run into the dams and turn the
water off.
THE HOMESTEAD GARDEN.
“L’Fou”: The garden of a farm home-
stead is often in summer a melancholy ruin
which detracts from the appearance of the
property. Don’t say it can’t be helped.
Even assuming that water cannot be supplied
or much time spared for this department,
appearances can be kept up if you start right
and cut according to yjmr cloth.
All plants take up their food from the soil
in solution. In absolutely dry soil nothing
will grow. But there are degrees of- dryness
that plants will put up with, and many
plants have periods of suspended animation.
Plants inure themselves to dryness by (a)
deep-rooting systems, which tap distant mois-
ture; (b) minimised transpiration; (c) stor-
age cells for reserve water; (d) abstemious
drinking habits and instincts handed down
from ages past. Keep these points in mind
when trying to make a garden bloom in a
drought.
The greater the available depth of soil, the
greater is the storage capacity for rain water
and the lower the rate of evaporation. There-
fore, cultivate deeply. Sufficient depth of
soil in good physical condition enables roots
to entrench themselves before the summer
comes.
Like a pump, every plant, weed or other-
wise, sucks water from the soil. So eliminate
weeds and don’t overcrowd the other plants.
Hard-packed earth under the sun’s influence
acts as a water-drawing wiek, so don’t have
any more earth-paths than you can help. A
protective mulch (nutritive if possible) is
essential on the cultivated beds. Hedges will
help check scorching winds and look well.
Above all, plant suitable, hardy things.
Trees and shrubs once established will hold
their own, and these should be the backbone
of the garden. Many indigenous plants are
particularly adapted to dry conditions, and
Australia offers a wide choice o,f attractive
flowering shrubs. Quick-growing, gross-feed-
ing flowers such as annuals should be grown
only for the season when rain is assured, and
vegetables must be quickly grown. But if
sound dry-farming methods are used with
fruit trees, regular crops may usually be
had. Fine shows, too, may be had of winter
and spring flowering bulbs, which have a sum-
mer resting season.
Plants with ornamental bark or foliage are
a good standby, the maintenance of foliage
being far less strain on the soil than a
crop of blossoms. Trim borders and minia-
ture hedges help keep up an appearance of
well-being in hard times. A well-built
rockery, with deep, rich soil-pockets, is well
adapted to dry gardening. The foliage sys-
tem of creepers is usually large in propor-
tion to the roots and therefore extravagant,
but some native creepers, such as purple sar-
saparilla, are drought-defying. Trailing
things, such as mesembryanthemums, are
often worth space as living mulch.
The dry garden should be laid out on a
large scale, but as space is usually no object
out back that condition doesn’t offer difficul-
ties.
KIDNEY POTATOES.
“Noah Fraid”: As an . early and late
potato crop, the quick-maturing kidneys
stand alone. They require a rich, deep,
sandy loam soil, having (I write now about
my own Victorian district) an easterly aspect
to minimise the risk from frost. Some years
ago I obtained a pound of Sharp’s Express,
and at the commencement (to work up
stock) grew three crops per annum. Later,
only two crops per annum were garnered,
the tubers being culled by selection and re-
selection, then finally strengthened by heavy
manuring with potassium sulphate—3cwt. to
the acre in late autumn, the land being left
to fallow through the winter.
I ulanted whole immature seed (well
sprouted in trays) at the rate of 15cwT. per
acre in July, sowing 4cwt. of super with the
seed, and top-dressing between the rows with
lcwt. of sulphate of ammonia when the
plants were about 6in. high. Dug in October,
the tubers were greened off, sprouted and re-
planted in February. To keep the seed cycle
going two crops per annum are essential.
When cased, the potatoes are worth (in
Vic.) anything from Bs. 6d. to 12s. 6d. per
case (501 b.), and for seed £l5 to £32 10s.
per ton. Sharp’s Express are ready for the
case in nine weeks from breaking, whilst
other varieties, such as Earliest of All and
Ashlea, take 11 weeks, and the Fluke Kidney
12 to 13 weeks. Rainfall, 25in. per annum,
and we have irrigation.
THE FARMER’S POULTRY FLOCK.
“Bufforp”: The advice to farmers to cull
out all the crosses in their feathered flocks
requires a lot of qualification. The farmer
has fowls as .a side-line, and generally his
feeding costs are lower than those of the
commercial poultry-farmer, as the chooks run
where they like and get their fill at the barn
or round the stacks. Regular feeding is not
carried out. The eggs he does not sell to the
grocer may go to the city, and are sold as
country eggs at cheap rates; so it doesn’t
matter whether the chooks that laid them
were pure or otherwise. What the farmer
should aim for is to keep up the stamina
and size of birds in his flock by regularly
introducing new blood by a rooster purchased
from a well-known strain of good layers and
decent-sized birds. On the other hand,
if a farmer does aim for a pure flock,
there’s no need to scrap the present
stock. Buy purebred cocks of the desired
strain and use them for a couple of
years, never allowing crossbred roosters
to do duty at the breeding. Keep on year
after year introducing the new roosters,
which will ultimately transform the progeny
into practically purebreds. The system takes
time, but it can be worked if you are not in
a hurry to change over. What ruins most
farmers’ lien-flocks is inbreeding.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Con Greet’’: For making concrete blocks
for piers use petrol- or kerosene-tins with the
top and bottom removed. If tins are plentiful
leave them on the blocks. They make better
moulds than a wooden box.
“Bill R.”: Paintbrushes that have been
neglected after use, and have hardened with
the drying paint, may be softened and
cleaned by immersion in boiling vinegar.
Give them a good wash out with soap and
warm water afterwards.
“Bushman”: Soak your new axe handle
in raw linseed-oil for a week or more, and
you won’t be buying another for many a day.
“Silentio”: Indian wax scale, also known
as white scale, can generally be beaten by
spraying with a solution of common washing
soda. For a kerosene-tin of hot water allow
about of soda, and spray while it is
warm.
“Calo”: Sheep licks that contain a large
proportion of sulphur should not be given
regularly to lambs, particularly if the flies
are busy. Sulphur sometimes penetrates the
skin and forms a foul crust on the shoulders'.
When apparently healthy lambs are found
to be blown in these parts the licks should
be suspected.
“Cuchulain”: If a dog gets bitten by a
snake, throw him into water if it is handy.
If he goes in a creek, the swimming may
work the poison out. If at home and the
usual remedy of permanganate is not handy,
turn the bath tap on and having made an
incision in the wound keep the do'g in for
awhile.
“Bosso” : Growers in our district have no
early sown pumpkins this year owing to
frosts cutting them down and making a later
sowing necessary! Those from early sown
crops are the best for storage. But if the
rind is too hard to pierce with the thumbnail
they will keep through the winter, provided
they are pulled with the stalk attached, and
not bruised. Store them in dry, airy sheds,
“Metallo” : In the last three or four years
the tin coating on kerosene- and petrol-
containers has been reduced in thickness, so
that they rust more readily than they used to
do. When the tins are used for blowfly-traps
or for other purposes where unnoticed leaks
are likely to cause a lot of inconvenience, a
good safeguard is to coat them with ordinary
fat or tallow —better than tar, because the
sun doesn’t lift it. Melt half a cupful in the
tin over the stove, and then with a swab daub
the fat over outside and inside, paying par-
ticular attention to the corners and joins.
“Darcy” : To preserve your well tanks and
troughing, give them a coat of red oxide on
the outside and a coat of boiled oil and
cement, mixed to the consistency of paint,
on the inside. Coat the pump rods and the
insides of the delivery pipes with boiling
tar, and the outside of those delivery pipes
which come in contact with the water with
oil and cement. Repeat every two years.
“D..T.H.”: The safest and best time to
caponise cockerels is when they commence
to crow; when the combs start to shoot up
and show red. If a bird dies under the opera-
tion or just after, cut the head off and
bleed well, and he is good for human con-
sumption. Starve the birds before you get
to work, and have an assistant to hold them.
“Minto”: If it is necessary to remove a
branch or limb of a tree when the sap is up,
cover the cut area with wet mud 1 . This
plaster stops excessive bleeding, and when
it dries up and drops off the sap will have
ceased to flow and the bark will soon cover
the cut portion.
“C.C.”: There is no month in the year
when the Australian wheatgrower’s foreign
competitors are not harvesting a crop.

“BOOST, DON’T KNOCK!”
How to Do Ourselves Justice Abroad.
A returned traveller complains that the Common-
wealth is misrepresented in the overseas press. “The
quiet, everyday things are omitted,” he says, “with
the result that strikes, murders, bomb outrages and
civic graft appear to be daily occurrences.”
Some suggestions for an improved news
service follow: —
Sydney (N.S.W.), Monday.—The new tele-
phone directory is out. It is a handsome
publication. A few new names are in it.
THE CAT WINS.
PERCY: “Dogs are the best. Cats are no good. They don’t know
what you tell ’em.”
ANNE: “Mine does. I say ‘Clarence, are you going to be a good
cat or aren’t you?’ And then he is or he isn’t, just like
that.”
but one recognises with pleasure many of the
old familiars. Twelve Smiths have been cut
off, as against which 32 new members of the
clan have come on the strength.
It was mentioned in our last issue that
Sydney is situated on a beautiful harbor. It
is still situated on it.
Omeo (Vic.). —This placid mountain vil-
lage has not had a murder since the last one.
Adelaide (S. Aus.), Wednesday.—Several
new churches are being built in this city.
The trams ran along King William-street yes-
terday as usual.
Melbourne (Vic.), Thursday.—John Smith,
a popular city liftman, reports that his lift
is working well. It is several months since
this lift had to be stopped for inspection.
Dr. Strabismus, a frequent user of the lift,
states that he has not been accused of kill-
ing a patient for a fortnight. He attributes
this to the fact that he is steadily gaining
in knowledge and surgical experience.
Heidelberg (Vic.), Thursday.—This beauti-
ful town is the centre of a thriving real-
estate industry. Owing to the excellence of
the railway communications, it also conducts
a splendid trade with its friendly rival Mel-
bourne. Yesterday morning at 8.40 it ex-
ported 100 typists to that city, importing
the same number by the 6.5 train in the
evening.
Stop Press. Canberra, Sunday. 9.30 a.m.

Bruce) ate a hearty breakfast this morn-
ing. This is his seventh this week and his

STANLEY MELBOURNE BRUCE
IN AGAIN FOR THREE YEARS.
But What of Flossie Flapper’s
Aching Heart ?
Stanley Melbourne Bruce, whose malign
activities are well known to readers of this
journal, is back at Canberra. For three
years—his favorite term.
Stanley Melbourne is known to the police
as one of the nattiest men in Australia; his
spats, he proudly boasts, are the talk of the
Commonwealth. A great fellow this Stanley
—in his own estimation. But he is a pro-
fessional deceiver, one who lives by deluding
and bedevilling the honest, hardworking
people who form the backbone of this sunny
Austral land of ours. And we propose to
prove it without fear, and without ambiguity,
as is the wont of this fearless organ of public
opinion.
What have you to say, Stanley M., about
your conduct to innocent little Flossie Flap-
per, the belle of Belgrave (Vic.) ? Flossie,
a bright-eyed, vivacious Australian girl of
21, had her first vote to cast, and was wooed
by one of Stan’s accomplices. Then, three
days before the election, the immaculate
Stanley Melbourne put in an appearance.
(He usually works this way.) Poor little
Flossie was taken right off her feet. What-
ever Stan hasn’t got, he certainly has “it”
and spats appeal.
Floss asked Stan if he would impose a tax
on bachelors, and Stan told her distinctly,
in the presence of two Keyhole investigators
and about 500 electors, that he would “con-
sider the matter.” Now Flossie worked on
the idea that Stan’s oft'sidcr would fall
for her, if it were to his financial advantage,
and Stan’s promise of consideration made her
cast her first vote in his cause.
Well, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, what are
you going to do about it? You’ve be-m
back at Canberra three weeks. Does the
heart of this lonely girl who gave her all,
electorally speaking, that you might be saved,
mean nothing to you? Aren’t you ashamed
of yourself? Don’t you quiver in your
spats? The Keyhole has done its duty by
the public, as please God it always will, and,
if the police wish to act, all our informa-
tion is at their disposal.
Let the people judge.

She dropped her eyes to the ground as he
approached, and a second later his eyes fell
upon her.
That’s why they got married. Being
without their eyes, they were too blind to

THE FINANCIER.
“I have a scheme,” said Soames, “by
which we can make a vast fortune.”
“We could do with one,” I observed.
“My idea is to raise the
Australia. Strictly in accord-
ance with the Versailles
treaty, of course.”
“It wouldn’t do to bust
the Versailles treaty.”
“Certainly not,” he agreed.
“The cost of raising her,”
he continued, will run into
only a paltry seven thousand
quid. Then there will be
trifling amounts for patch-
ing, oiling, a new coat of
duco, towage, harbor dues
and wharfage, say another
couple of thousand. But we
soon get it all back.”
“How?”
“Well, first of all we’d
sell the oysters off her and
the other shellfish, also the
barnacles, which make excel-
lent soup; ana 'he crabs and
lobsters. Start a shop for
the purpose—probably on
the Circular Quay. Then
we’ll throw her open to the
public at a bob a head and
having shown her at all the
principal ports of. Australia
we’ll crack her up into
small fragments and sell
them neatly wrapped in at-
tractive cardboard boxes as
souvenirs. Then”
“But say the heads at
Versailles get nasty.”
“By the time they hear of the venture we II
have made all we want. If _ they get
really offensive we can always sink what’s
left of her —strictly in accordance with the
Treaty again. The film rights of the raising
and the second sinking will help considerably,
by the way, to swell our profits”
“I’m beginning to get hungry,” I said.
“It must be near lunch-time.”
“Well, there’s a water tap handy, said
Soames, “and if you’ve got fourpence on you
we’ll buy a couple of pies.”

“‘Hush, Jasper,’ she said in a flat voice. ‘You don’t understand.’”
CHAPTER I.
Jasper.
" TASPER!”
The heavy lids of the sleeping boy
* winced, as though the low, entreat-
ing voice alarmed his prostrate conscious-
ness; but the stertorous rhythm of his
breathing remained unchanged. He lay
upon his right side, with knees drawn into
the pit of his stomach and a hand hugging
the blankets to his chin. His mouth was
half open, revealing the healthy red of his
tongue and the white of his sturdy teeth.
A tangle of dark thick hair fell upon his
frowning forehead, giving his features an
oddly animal sharpness, and throwing into
relief the rust-colored freckles on his checks.
“Jasper! Jasper!”
He was dreaming of the bracken-lands on
the slope of Musk Ridge. He was standing
knee-deep in a foam of fern fronds; a
great, uneven pool of greenly-wet weed that
sent out a faint, sticky odor tinged with
the pungency of sweat. His head was dully
throbbing; the weariness of his body was
a physical pain. Each swing of the fern-
hook in his blistered hands required an effort
. of will so immense that he seemed to feel
the fibres of his brain bursting asunder.
There was that in the reaching
frond tentacles which filled him with a kind
of panic. They were like soggy fingers
writhing up the blade of his hook.
“Jasper! It’s past four!”
A little moan escaped him. The fingers
of fern were slowly dragging the hook from
his hands, were wining around his body,
were rising in a green and brown tide about
his face< He clutched despairingly at the
vanishing fern-hook that was really the
blanket being ruthlessly stripped from his
body. He was shaking with fear; the weight
of it was on his shoulder, like, a hand.
“Awake, Jasper?”
“Yes, Aunt. All right, Aunt.”
He heard her leave the room with the
queer, uncertain movement induced by her
shortened left leg. It was characteristic of
Ann Martin, that step. Its unbalance was
reflected in her voice, in her manner. The
whole woman was hesitant, fearful.
The b'oy slid to the uncovered slab
floor and drew off his thin flannelette night-
dress. The chill of it leaped at his brown
nakedness, driving the last vestige of sleep
from his eyes. Deliberately he stood a
moment poising himself half scornfully
against the shock. He was tall for bis
thirteen years, with lean barrel and flanks,
and a straight, beautiful back. His features
were irregular, and gave promise of strength,
rather than of looks, to come. He had a
short, blunt nose; his mouth was large and
his jaw square; his eyes were agate brown
and filled with little liquid lights.
He was clad presently in shirt and
trousers and rough woollen stockings, and
began to struggle with boots that were
frozen to the hardness of wood, with laces
stiff as wire. And at once his feet began
to tingle. The chilblains on his finger:)
made the tying of the laces doubly difficult.
His hands, too, began to burn and tnrob.
Later this hurt would turn to an intoler-
able itching. But he tried not to think of
that. For the moment he was more con-
cerned with his right heel, that had a sore
where the stiff leather had chafed through
the skin. His lower lip was caught between
his teeth while he made the first few steps.
He put on his coat and hat, and wound a
muffler about his neck.
Shortly he was fumbling to unchain the
dog from its kennel in the yard. The
animal—a half-bred Smithfield—whined its
approval, and tried desperately to lick his
face. It vvas mad with eagerness to escape
its sodden bed. Jasper blew upon his fingers,
the sceam of his breath spurting like smoke.
He saidi with chattering teeth: “Steady,

“Jasper.!”
“Yes, Aunt?”
“Jaspie!” She named him so only when
specially stirred. “Jaspie, your -uncle’s in
one of his black moods. Bea good boy.
Try hard not to to displease him.”
Jasper stood up awkwardly and held his
hands to the fire.
“All right, Aunt.... Aunt?”
“Yes, dear?”
“Aunt, can I have some hot water and
soda to do my chilblains with? Tod Harris
done his with that, and they don’t hurt
near so much.”
“Yours are cracked, dear. It wouldn’t
be any use. I’ll make some lard ointment.”
“Aunt please?”
Ann Martin said miserably: “Jaspie, not
now. Try not to mind them. You’ll be
late at the factory. Listen! Was that your
uncle calling?”
There were tears of torment and rebellion
in his eyes. “They hurt!” he said.
“Jaspie, dear. Jaspie— please!”
Suddenly, _ while he still held sullenly
silent, she joined her tears to his. She
began to stammer inexplicably: “Jasper,
why aren’t you older, bigger? Oh, if you
could only grow up quicker!’
He could make nothing of this But her
crying shamed his innocence, somehow. He
began almost to blubber. .

CHAPTER 11.
“
' . . Musk Ridge. _
The milking sheds were lit by, a hum-
cane lamp swung from a rafter. They were
constructed of slab uprights, with a roof
of shingle. Strips of bark had been nailed
down the joins of the slabs, but these
had long since split to the shrinking of the
timber. The floor was of slabs also. These,
settling into the earth, had become uneven
and insecure The slightest pressure fetched
a spew of vile slime from the joins.
The bails gave on to a yard that was a
morass of frozen filth, through which the
cattle stamped almost to the hocks. Their
udders were slimed with the stuff when
they came into the stalls; it had to be
washed off before milking could be
attempted.
The cows were a lean, mongrelly breed,
with the rough hides that flaunt a starva-
tion diet. Even in their flush they gave
but little milk; and this of poor account.
Their yield was reduced now to a mere
winter’s pittance. The whole herd of fifteen
barely filled the twelve and a half gallon
can that went each morning to the cheese
factory at Guruwa.
Jasper milked with his head burrowed
into a shaggy flank and his knees trembling
to the weight of a filling bucket. His feet
were blocks of ice, beyond reach of then-
former agony of irritation, or, indeed, of
sensation of any kind. The hot milk
soothed his hands, and for the time his chil-
blains were forgotten. He would remember
them only when anointing a sore teat with
petroleum jelly, taken from a tin at the
head of the bail. He would anoint his
fingers at the same time,
j n the adjoining bail his uncle was rising
to empty his own bucket into the strainer
se t j n the neck of the can. His milking stool
bad only a single leg. As is the fashion
in some parts of Gippsland, the stool was
strapped to his hind parts, so that as he
talked to and fro one had the absurd
impression that he wore a tail. He had need
oldy to assume a sitting posture, and the
ac t wag accomplished.
In mogt h the quain tness of it

cated observer; in the case of Hector

and he was tall and stooping, with overlong
limbs. He wore no hat, seeming impervious
to the cold, and his high head proclaimed
itself bald and shining, except for a ragged
circle of mouse-colored hair. From full
temples his face narrowed to a pointed
pepper-and-salt beard. His eyes were black
and deeply sunken; his nose fleshy and con-
gested; his mouth a straight slit. His was
the face of an intellectual marred by self-
treason; a swift, sharp, clever face having

Pen and Picture
Shadow Shows
Those who
have a passion
for dogs should
find plenty of
interest in “Al-
most Human”
(P.D.C.). The
dogs friendly
looking, clean,
lovable chaps—
are pictured as an audience to which another
hound tells what happened when he met an
out-of-work girl in a park, and presently
helped to introduce her to the famous half-
back whom she married, against the wish of
his raa, but left when she overheard him
saying lie regretted the step, to be joined to
him again when she realised it was all a
mistake.... and so on. The story reeks with
snobbishness. The half-back —that seems to
be his only claim to elevation —is represented
as having married below him in taking on
tiie out-of-work girl; and lie 4, is cut off by
his mother without a bob until the girl
proves that, though she may be only poo-or
her ’eart is kind and true. Very cheap sen-
timentalism, all of it, but-perhaps no worse
than can be found any day in the news-
papers of our own great democracy, which
sob slushily because our airmen don’t
get knighted. The leading people in the
film are Vera Reynolds and Kenneth Thomp-
son, but it is only the hounds that make it
at all out of the ordinary
It is a sufficient bouquet to hurl at “Hot
Heels” (Universal) to say that its private
showing packed the firm’s doll’s-house theatre
in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, and kept the
little bunch of usually apathetic onlookers
gurgling almost throughout. It is good
straight comedy*. Much of it is burlesque
of the bellowdrama, all the funnier because
the screen is so overcast with bellow; it is a
healthy sign when a sentimentalist can laugh
at himself. The first part—a cheap theatrical
company acting the old hero-heroine-villain
story—is uncommonly rich in good chuckles
and there is more good laughter in the ex-
periences of the stranded company at the
local pubbery, and later, when the liappi-
ness of the

of “Hot Heels.”
structed, however, that the drift is fairly
natural, and the don’t-care-a-damn wooing
of the hero and heroine saves it from
degenerating into slush. Glenn Tryon is
practically the whole picture. He is
a ding-dong comedian who can act, and
who spurns the temptation to imitate Chap-
lin or anybody else. Horsey folk will find
an added interest in the appearance of old
Tod Sloan, even though Tod can’t act for
monkey-straps and doesn’t ride Hot Heels.
Patsy Ruth Miller is the girl, and she works
admirably in double harness with Tryon.
“Two Lovers” (United Artists) is Fred
Niblo’s version of Baroness Orczy’s “Leather-
face,” set in Flanders of the sixteenth cen-
tury, and concerned with the Spanish in-
vasion of those blood-soaked flats, particu-
larly round about Ghent. The story is an
uncommonly good one for the movies, with
strong patriotic and love themes threaded
through it. There is also aii interesting
mystery figure, which, however, is not ex-
ploited as it might be, and there is ample
of the suspense that can he worked
through duels and the cheerful sorts
of torture that were fashionable in
those days. Baroness Orczy, as her title
indicates, was most concerned with Leather-
face ; Niblo, as Ms title indicates, is most con-
cerned with the love theme, to work out which
he lets history and continuity go hang. As
a false gesture of peaceful intent, the in-
vading Duke of Azar arranges the marriage
of his niece with the son of Ghent’s High
Bailiff. The marriage is rather cold, but the
damsel is beginning to realise that she has
drawn a jrnize, when she discovers that her
husband is the loathed Leatherface, who, sup-
porting William of Orange, has been playing
the dickens with the invaders’ little schemes.
She learns simultaneously that her husband
killed her former lover, and, in this situation
of what-is-a-poor-girl-to-do, she tells her
uncle. While Leatherface is being tortured,
she learns that her former lover was killed
for attempting what the dailies call “a
serious assault,” and she gets square with
her conscience by letting into Ghent the
secretly-organised army which overthrows
her countrymen. Ronald Colman, as Leather-
face, and Vilma Banky, as the girl, are about
as much Flemish and Spanish, as they are
garlic and tulips, but the strength of the
nlot carries them along. Noah Beery, as the
Duke, is much better, as, indeed, anyone with
such a name ought to be.
After swallowing the fact that once upon
a time there was a war in which America
played a superlative part, it is quite possible
to sit back and enjoy a run of good laughs
from “Plastered in Paris” (Fox). The
principal laugh-merchant is Sammy Cohen
(possibly a Jew), who injected pretty well
all there was to laugh at into “What Price
Glory.” The first score or so feet are de-
voted to a war that never was on land or sea,
but as only about 0.00007 per cent, of those
who will view the picture ever saw a war,
that rather increases the excellence of the
entertainment. It is all utterly impossible,
and nearly all funny. Cohen —first as a Yank
in the line, next as a Yank araons Paris
girls, next as a Yank in the Foreign Legion,
and next as a Yank in a Riff harem —is
humorous in a Hebrew way throughout, and
he is well supported by Jack Pennick, a
large young man with a face so honest that
it is laughable. The girl, Lola Salvi, won a
beauty contest in France a year or so ago,
and acts about up to the standard of beauty-
contest winners.
The Palette
There are so much futurism, primitivism
and astigmatism in Art nowadays that the
old-fashioned pictures of W- Follen Bishop,
R.8.A., and the late Florence Fitz Gerald,
R.B.C. (Decoration Galleries, Collins-
street), come almost as a staggering reve-
lation. Impressionism, post-impressionism
and post-post-impressionism have passed over
the heads of these two artists and left them
uncorrupted. You can count the leaves on
Florence Fitzgerald’s trees, and the flowers
in Mr. Bishop’s English cottage-gardens
could be catalogued by any competent
seedsman.
Robert Waden, who has secured the
Society of Arts Gallery, Adelaide, for a
fortnight, has buttressed his own show with
a strong borrowed lot. His work in oils is
rapidly gaining acceptance, and the Adelaide
Art Gallery has bought his “Summer Haze.”
Waden loves pasture-land, with brown trees
in the foreground, all with the rather hard
line that is seen also in the younger British
school. Victorians Knox—quite Strceton-
like at times —Herbert Rose and Newbury
arc well represented. Sturgess, Harold Her-
bert and Eldershaw stand out in the water-
color section; Gwendolyn Grant, from Q.,
puts in an unexpected appearance; Leslie
Wilkie has a pleasant Little Girl, and Cum-
brae Stewart shows the accustomed and
attractive vertebrae*. And the etchings by
Malcolm Helsby, an Adelaide man, are of
top class ; Adelaide Gallery has bought one.
“F.S.” : Before taking up his new job as
director of Sydney National Gallery, J. S.
MacDonald revealed that when Count Tam-
burini, the Papal painter who attended the
Eucharistic Congress, was shown the £14,000
Tintoretto portrait of the Doge Pietro Lore-
dano, purchased for the Felton Bequest, he
said he “knew the original.” His startled
guide asked where it was. “lii the collec-
tion of .T. Ross Delafield, of New York,” was
the reply; the Melbourne acquisition, the
Count asserted, was what is called a “studio
replica,” the sort the Old Masters’ pupils
painted, leaving the master to put in the
finishing touches. A reproduction of the
Delafield portrait, unearthed by MacDonald,
appears to confirm the assertions. The
Bulletin long ago pointed out that to
ascribe to Tintoretto everything in the Mel-
bourne “Loredano” was to insult an artist
who couldn’t answer back.
“Lao-dah”: The wrangle over the Vic.
National Gallery ceramics has reached a
point where some action by the Felton Be-
quest committee is called for. The criticised
pieces include what are claimed to be 35 rare
examples of ancient Chinese dynasties. Frank
Godden, a one-time local dealer in antiques,
asserted that some of these were modern, so
three were sent to the British Museum for
verification. They returned much humbled in
prestige. Godden has since extended the
charge of spuriousness to the rest of the
collection, and offered to back his judgment
for £lOO. The faking of old Ming goes on
as merrily in China as the copying of Old
Masters in Europe; at the same time there
is plenty of the genuine article, owing to
the Celestial habit of burying a good half
of the family wealth in the family sepulchre.
The Inky Way
“Lao-dali”: The curtest, as well as the
most irreverent, headline appeared in a W.A.
paper during the war, when W. M. Hughes,
then in the zenith of his glory, was reported
to be slightly indisposed. It simply said,
“Bill 111!”
“Hayband”: From the “For Sale” notices
in a Sydney suburban daily:—
A cosy furnished cottage, within gunshot of the
surf. Easy terms.
Probably we shall next hear of places a
mere razor-slash away.
“Zorro”: Francis Utting, editor of the
Wanganui Chronicle and formerly of Syd-
ney Sun, is issuing a section in Maori with
the formidable title of “Nga Take e Pa Ana
Ivi te Iwi Maori.” The innovation has
caught on with the natives, but it has pro-
vided another problem for the proof-reader.
“Centurion”: Somehow my mind ran back
to the dear old days of the Divisional Staff
when I read in the Sydney Evening News
that a one-time French soldier had appeared
in a Sydney police court sporting the ribbon
of the “Croix de Beurre.” Quite a lot of
butter” decorations were issued during the
war that was to end war, but the fact was
never so frankly stated before.
These Australians are everywhere. One
Cola Carrol] is a journalist in Berlin, and
doing well. His father, a German baron, came
to Tasmania many years ago, and married
Miss Carroll, of Circular Head; the young
Berlin journalist was born at Zeehan. He
had a queer war experience: an officer on the
Allies’ side, he was wounded, taken prisoner
and jugged close to where his father was
born.
“Lao-dah”: Melbourne Herald proprie-
tary is now the largest newspaper organisation
in Australia, perhaps in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, though some of the Spanish-American
concerns must run it pretty close. The huge
warren_ in h linders-street at present houses
upwards of 1200 workers, issues about a
dozen periodicals, and caters for all portions
of the community except the Socialists. It
should be an encouragement to artists to
know that chairman of directors Theodore
1 ink began life with the ambition to be a
painter.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
A filly called Luita, by Sir Dighton-
Berylacre, made a distinct impression on the
crowd at Canterbury Park, Sydney, on Satur-
day by the pace she showed in a division of
the Trial Stakes. Favorite at 6 to 4 on,
she bounded to the front in the first furlong,
and was apparently only going at half-pace
towards the finish of six, run in lmin. 15seo.
She is owned, and trained at Rosehill, by
William Booth, who, the story goes, ex-
pects to win the Carrington Stakes with
her. If this is so, it is rather remarkable
that he should have exposed her form before
the weights were issued; she has now been
handicapped at 7st, 101 b. instead of, per-
haps, 6st. 7lb. The filly is a half-sister to
Manacre, a very smart two-year-old in his
day.
Remora, the daughter of Rossendale —
Demeter, whom Marsden trains for the
Bricns, won the Flying Handicap almost as
easily; and in her case the time was llscc.
faster and the field of much better quality.
Hazel Boy (10 to 1), a poor second to
Remora, who went out at evens, would be
handicapped to give two or three stone to
anything that Luita beat. Remora is on
the same mark as Luita in the Carrington
Stakes; it is questionable whether either is
within 61b. of Whitta, 121 b of Karuma or
201 b. of Sion.
The betting on the 10-furlongs handicap
was remarkable: 5 to 1 Hard Chip, Chry-
sotta, Gwillian G., The Grindstone and
Frances Cyllene, and 6 to 1 Orange Prince
and Nimrod. And yet McShortodds
grumbled. Orange Prince showed that his
Warwick Farm success had been no fluke
by outstaying the others, of whom Nimrod
and Frances Cyllene did best. He ran the
11 furlongs in 2min. 21|sec., and as he is
in form and possesses stamina, he may have
a chance in the Summer Cup with 7st. 21b.
or in Tatt.’s Club Cup with lib. more.
Speechmaker (7 to 2), who was third to
Orange Prince at Warwick F'arm, was suc-
cessful in the Welter after a close finish with
the unlucky Valhalla (8 to 1), whose party
unavailingly protested.

The V.R.C. had delightful weather for its
Benevolent Fund meeting at Moonee Valley
on Saturday, and though the horses for the
most part were very ordinary they provided
some exciting racing. The crow 7 d found the
Fund Handicap finish particularly thrilling;
Ned O’Dwyer’s Red Dennis gelding Red Sea
(5 to 1) got the verdict by half a head from
old Tookarby (4 to 1), who showed a glimpse
of the form that made him moderately
famous, though his admirers would rather
see him in a paddock. The much-raced and
decidedly unlucky little Reputed King (7 to
2) was third. Scanlon rode a particularly
strong race on the winner. He is an especi-
ally good boy on a nag that is inclined to
loaf.
# * * St
Jeering at the judge’s decision seems to
have become a pastime with a section of
Melbourne racegoers, and a close finish in the
youngsters’ race gave some bad losers an-
other opportunity of squealing. To unpre-
judiced observers it was obvious that the
Treclare colt Barythorn (S to 1), from Dick
Bradfield’s stable, had beaten Lanneret (10
to 1), though the howlers affected to think
otherwise. The Claro gelding Claronga (5 to
1), well ridden by Harold Jones, followed up
his Epsom success with a victory in the
Welter, the ex-South Australian Double Duty
(7 to 1) being a close second; and Jack
Holt’s Lilyveil gelding Cobranveil (3 to 1),
who had failed at Epsom, made amends in the
Highweight, Quirk (9 to 2), whom Eric
Connolly imported, following him home;
Running Wild (8 to 1), also imported, was
third. In a division of the Welter Purse
the Menin gelding Barigi (7 to 1) completed
a double for Scanlon by leading all the way.

“Ivnib”: The bulk of the McPherson

introduced by the Hogans, so that measure
is to be dropped. It would have been slaugh-
tered in any case in the Plush House. Pre-
mier McPherson believes in a tote without

makers. This expedient may be tried if the

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
A willing and lively mill between Charlie
Purdy of Maoriland (9st. 131 b.) and Aus-
tralian welter champion Jack Carroll (lOst.
31b.). at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night,
resulted in Purdy getting the verdict on a foul
in the 11th round. Opening carefully, both
men warmed up and were soon swapping
stiff punches, Purdy marring his work by
excessive clinching. The ML. fighter com-
plained of being struck low in the sixth,
but “Box-on” was the order. Hard exchanges
saw matters very even when Purdy appealed
again for a low punch. This time the referee
upheld him and Carroll was disqualified.
Vigorous action characterised the • ) ' < a' l '.v
Gardiner (9st. If lb.) —George Hyland (Sst.
13f lb.) clash at Melbourne Stadium on
Saturday, but, as is usual when two local
lads are engaged, the crowd was of miserable
proportions. Before five rounds they had each
taken enough punishment to stop a bullock,
but appeared to be quite impervious to each
other’s bombardment, carrying on at an un-
abated pace. In the 6th, the veteran George
appeared to be getting the upper hand, but
the ex-sailor’s superb condition enabled him
to weather the storm, and to come back in
the Bth with a succession of rights that
had George floundering. Over the closing
rounds the punch-drunk pair disregarded
defence almost entirely. Hyland landed
oftener and cleaner, and thoroughly deserved
the decision in his favor.
The Ins and Outs
The 115th Test match between Australian
and English elevens began at Brisbane on
Friday last to the accompaniment of a
jazz symphony of press blatherskite which
has not been equalled in the long history of
these games. Chapman won the toss, and
Hobbs (49) and Sutcliffe (38) made the
usual staud till the Yorkshireman was caught
off Gregory by Ponsford, and Plobbs was
run out from a fine return by Bradman.
Mead went l.b.w. to Grimmett for 8. and 3
were down for 108. Hammond batted de-
lightfully for 44 till Woodfull took him from
Gregory. Jardine (35) was caught off Iron-
monger by Woodfull, and Chapman and Hen-
dren batted out time with the score at the
satisfactory figure, from an Australian point
of view, of 5 for 272. Chapman went early
next morning; for 50, hut Hendren, aided
by Larwood (70) and Tate (26), went on
to score a splendid 169 before Ironmonger
got him, caught by Ponsford, the innings
ending at 521. Gregory was in something
like his old form to get 3 for 142. Though
Ironmonger bagged two good wickets (Jar-
dine and Hendren) for '79, he rarely looked
troublesome. ICelleway provided some ex-
cellent batting practice for the visitors, and
Hendry got Larwood l.b.w. Ryder was also
ineffective with the ball. It is interesting lo
consider that one of the proven best bowlers
in Australia during the past four years, R.
Oxenham, was relegated to the pavilion as
12th man while the English batsmen pasted
the antediluvians who were preferred to him.
Disaster fell upon the opening Australian
batsmen. Within 10 minutes player-writers
Woodfull (0) and Ponsford (2) were out to
Larwood, the latter clean bowled. Kippax
was e'. and b. Tate for 16, and player-writer
Kelleway was bowled by Larwood for 8. One
player-writer blamed the shadows cast by the
stands as the sun set for the disaster. “Dusk
and the shadows falling” do not seem to have
in the least affected the non-literary Chap-
man and Ilendren in the same circumstances
the previous evening. However, Ryder and
Hendry appealed against the light, and
stumps were drawn with 4 for 44. There
was more trouble in store for the Austra-
lians on Monday, and, with Gregory unable
to bat, the innings closed for 122 (Hendry
30. Ryder 33 and Bradman 18). Larwood
took 6 for 32 —a splendid performance—and
Tate 3 for 50. England went in again after
lunch, the only question then being how
much it would win by. After every allow-
ance has been made, our men have been
beaten in every department of the game. Too
much mixing of playing with writing, per-
haps.
* * * *
With Ryder, Ironmonger and co. away
in Brisbane, the South Australians played up
with the bat in the Sheffield match in Adel-
aide, running up the tine score of 582. Victor
Richardson, again disappointed with 27, but
G. W. Harris played a great knock for 155.
The surprise of the innings was young B. W.
Hone, of University, who made an attrac-
tive 137 in his first Sheffield match. “Nip”
Pellew (64) and Whitfield (66) were other
contributors to a consistent score-sheet.

“Cash Amateur”: While on the subject of
the sins of the Sydney Cricket Ground
trustees (B. 28/11/’2B) it might be perti-
nent to ask who gave them authority to
lease the ground for long periods to the pro-
fessional Rugby League. The deed of grant
sets out that the area was vested in the
first place in the trustees as a ground
for cricket played under the mgis of the
N.S.W.C.A. In the second place it was to
be devoted to other games and amusements
at such periods as shall not interfere with the
game of cricket, viz., amateur athletic sports, base-
ball, bowls, tennis, handball, football, athletic sports
including the Highland Gathering and amusements
of that description, cycling.-
The Rugby League is not and never has
been anything but a professional sports
organisation. How it got control of the
amateur ground for so long is one of those
mysteries which seem to have no explanation.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Some time ago the English
Cricket Board of Control and the Maryle-
bone C.C. went into consultation on the ques-
tion of extending future Test matches in
England from three to four days. After dis-
cussion, the matter was referred to the
County Advisory Committee, which regulates
the county championships, and this lias
advised against the alteration. The objec-
tion to the extension is that it would utterly
disorganise the county programmes for the
season. After all, the county championship
is the principal thing in English cricket, and
no one can blame the counties for declining
to have their competitions turned upside
down for the convenience of overseas teams
visiting England. With South Africa, the
West Indies and perhaps M.L. all in the
running, in addition to Australia, Test cric-
ket of one sort or another promises to become
an annual affair in England, with the result
that any extension of the period of play
seems quite out of the question. Further-
more, any scheme to extend the already
sufficient agony of long-drawn-out cricket
calls for ruthless squelching.
* # * *
“Pads”: W. J. Bowes, a well-known Aus-
tralian cricket umpire, had something inter-
esting to say during Country Week in Sydney
on the eternal l.blw. discussion. The advent
of the Englishmen, past-masters at playing a
breaking ball with the pad, has revived the
agitation for a more liberal l.b.w. rule. The
authorities in England have been puzzling
over the same difficulty, but have so far
failed to reach a solution. Bowes simply
advocates the abolition of leg guards. The
idea has all that splendid simplicity that is
the hallmark of genius, but it is doubtful
whether modern batsmen would care to face
Scott or Larwood without armor plating. In
the great days of old, when pitches were
not as perfect as they are now, batsmen
habitually stood up without protection to
the bowling of such speed merchants as
Hayward and Freeman, the latter declared
by “W.G.” to be the best fast bowler lie ever
faced. C. I. Thornton, of a still later genera-
tion, scorned pads. But he was the last of
the line.

llow many a two-foot putt I hit
Goes trickling past the tin,
Or hesitates and halts at last
And looks forlornly in,
While through my twitching shoulder-blades
I feel the caddies grin!
How many a good hole has been lost
Because I moved my head.
Or tensed my arms or slacked my wrists,
Or felt much over-fed
And found the wretched putt I played
Was anything but dead.
But all these things are altered now,
No more I’ll miss my putts,
Or want to creep away and live
With Kaffirs in their huts,
Or hear the mutter of the crowd,
“Poor fool, he’s got no guts!”
The five-footers, the six-footers,
The most annoying sort,
I’ll hole like anything when at
This most upsetting sport;
I’ll hesitate no more when faced
With any putt that’s short....
I’ll know it’s dead because it’s in
The Telegraph’s report.

The Ins and Outs
The NS.W. country cricket week in
Sydney ended with a drawn game be-
tween a combined' eleven of the visitors
and a metropolitan team. Country s score
of 406 contained an attractive contribution
of 146 by G. Andrews, of East Maitland, who
is already being acclaimed another Brad-
matf. Metropolis lost 4 wickets for 20J, the
innings showing, as did the games,
that there was no budding Mclvibbm or
Turner visible among the countrymen.
sjs * *
The Queenslanders sustained a disastrous
licking at the hands of the Englishmen. Their
fielding went all to pieces on the Monday,
with the result that Leyland, dropped four
times, reached 114, the English total rising
to 293. Queensland again suffered a batting
collapse, and, though the North Queensland
lad Litster hit freely for 59, the innings
ended at 160, England winning by an innings
and 17 runs. Geary took 5 for 47 m Queens-
land’s second knock.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp” : Crossing Moore Park
from the Sydney Cricket Ground I pulled up
at a junior match, and noticed that my oni
friend Blotto was acting as umpire. Seven
runs were wanted by the batting side and
the last men were in. They were a. stolid
pair and only three runs came in five
minutes. There was a sharp appeal, and my
friend gave a l.b.w. decision. The next
minute he was hurrying me across to the
pub, ignoring a wild outcry from the losing
team’s supporters, and I mentioned that the
batsman didn’t seem out to me. “Of course
lie wasn’t,” said Blotto'. “But he deserved
to be out long ago—pottering like that, ihe
cow ought to have remembered that tne
pubs close at six’.”
* * * *
“G.E.”: The All England Eleven of 1874,
captained by the late W. G. Grace, drew a
sharp line between the Gentlemen and the
Players. The professionals were given a
second-class passage out and home, with 1170
and keep per man for the touil On arrival
at Melbourne the Gentlemen were sent to
one hotel and the Players to another, and this
rule was observed throughout the tour. At
one place the Players complained that they
were let out by the promoters, to whom they
were under contract, at 7s. 6d. per day,
“like a horse and trap.”
$ Sj! # *
“Gabba”: The sorrows of the man whose
fate it is to prepare a Test-match wicket are
many and varied; so much so that it would
seem impossible for any new burden to be
laid upon his shoulders. This has happened
in Brisbane however. Swallows are very
plentiful in the northern capital this season,
and nest-building is in full swing. The
constant watering of the cricket pitch at the
Exhibition Ground instantly appealed to
these ingenious fowl, the soaked earth of the
pitch being ideal for building purposes. Ihe
consequence was that the birds raided the
pitch in such numbers as to give rise to the
question whether there would be any of it
left for the cricketers to play on. It has
been necessary to put a guard on the watered
pitch in the daytime until the shades of
night brought security.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Tli e yelp that Freedom is
said to have emitted when Kosciusko threw
in his marble was nothing to that released
by the Sydney yellow press last week at the
rumor that Don Bradman had been offered
a job in Brisbane, and would in future play
cricket for Queensland. As one of the chroni-
clers despairingly cried, such a happening
would “be little short of a Tragedy.”
* * * *
“Everton”: George Duckworth, the little
English ’keeper, whose work has already im-
pressed Australian critics, is that rather
unusual person in a Dancashire XI, a Lan-
cashireman. Born at Warrington, where the
wire comes from, he first entered the
higher walks of cricket as a professional
with the Warwickshire Club and Ground.
He returned to Lancashire, and had the good
luck to figure in a minor match at Old Traf-
ford, in which that keenest of judges, A. C.
Maclaren, took part. From then on Duck-
worth figured as the Red Rose custodian,
and is probably the best man in the position
in England to-day.
**- * *
“Tenth Slip” : The collapse of tlm batting
in the England-Queensland match in Bris-
bane—for only villainous catching by the
Northerners enabled the visitors to at last
scramble up a moderately good score—is still
further evidence of the fact that the bad-
wicket batsman has vanished from among
us, in England as in Australia. Neither
side can boast a batsman of the tvpe of
Jessop and Maurice Read, or Harry Graham
and Jack Worrall, men who were at their
top when the wicket was getting in its dirty
work. The Brisbane match was not an isolated
instance. The same thing has happened a
dozen times in Australia of late years when-
ever the pitch has been queered by rain. That
it has not happened more often is due to the
obsession for covering the wicket. To that,
too, is due the fact that the great majority
of modern first-class batsmen are as helpless
as primary school kids when they face any
decent bowler who knows how to utilise a
tricky pitch.
“Lachlander”: This is .going to be a
bumper year for cricket, and I want to ask
one pertinent question. Why should a bats-
man be allowed to thump the wicket with
his bat in an endeavor to make rough places
smooth? Jf he may interfere with the
ground to his advantage, why not allow the
bowler to make a few holes in the pitch with
his heels, which may turn out advantageous
to him? It seems to me that all interference
with the ground by either batsman or bowler
should be forbidden'. The umpires alone
should have the right to meddle with it. There
is too much mollycoddling in this cricket
game for my liking.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: The petty spirit of disparage-
ment of Queensland cricket (B. 24/11/’2B)
is not confined to players only. In a final
spasm of rage at the idea of Queensland
daring to stage a Test match, visiting
experts from the South have been concen-
trating on the Exhibition Ground, and much
sarcasm has been expended on the fact that
pig and cattle pens are visible outside the
boundaries of the playing area. As a matter
of fact, the ground is one of the best
appointed in Australia, the stand accommoda-
tion being particularly good and up to date,
while the playing arena is fit to rank with
the best anywhere. Queensland has also
taught its southern sisters a lesson in
the financial aspects of the game. While
Melbourne and Sydney refused to entertain
the idea of reserving grandstand seats as
impracticable, the northern association re-
served 800, and charged 255. each for them,
in addition to the ordinary admission fees.
They have been snapped up like hot cakes,
and the sum guaranteed by the Cricket Asso-
A DISTURBER OF THE PEACE.

ciation was thereby assured before a ball
was bowled in the match.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: Harley Malcolm, lion sec. of
the Australian Tennis Association and
lately manager of the Australian women’s
team abroad, had some nice things to say
of his girls on returning home. They won
all 13 of the matches played, these being
against all the leading tennis countries save
America, and the score, 76 rubbers to 16,
was remarkable. Malcolm forecasts the
visit to Australia in November, 1929, of the
Englishwomen’s Wightman Gup team, after
they have defended the Cup against America,
while Borotra, Cochet, De Buzelet and
another junior have definitely decided to tour
Australia in the summer of 1929-30.

“Rev. Knucklebone”: The information that
the tours of the Davis Gup and women’s
tennis teams had resulted in a loss to the
Australian Tennis Association of over £2OOO
struck that body dumb with dismay. Not
even a moan of agony has yet been heard
from the sufferers, though the dreadful tid-
ings were published a week ago. The frozen
silence of the N.S.W. people is especially
alarming. The Davis Cup tour loss of £9OO
is bad enough, but when one considers that
• the flapper tour depleted the association
coffers of close on 1300 quid it is hard to
write for thinking of it.
ifc :j:
“Cut Shot”: There was a delicious touch
in an interview with one of the returned
Australian women tennis players which
appeared in a Brisbane journal. Talking of
D’Alvarez, the lady skated rapidly over her
tennis ability and reached the peak load
of admiration with “She always looks so
attractive, and her hair bandeaux are always
so novel.” How frightfully thrilling, what?
* * * *
Though Victoria was minus several front-
rank players in, the inter-State tennis match
with N'.S.W. in Melbourne, the latter, at
full strength, only got home by 11 rubbers
to 10, or 24 sets 253 games to 24 sets 231
games. Features of the match were the
2 sets to 1 defeat of Ilopman by T. K.
Fitchett in the singles, and the doubles vic-
tory of A. H. Hassett and JR. E. Schlesinger,
who beat Hopman and Crawford, 7-5, 6-4.
The Yarrasiders also tackled South Aus-
tralia, and won by 15 rubbers to 61
The Nineteenth Hole
“Old Q.”: Queensland has a caddie golf
champion it is willing to stack up against
the N.S.W. crack. “Mo” Cohen (B.
21/11/’2B). This is the 14-year-old N.
Vonnida, who recently won the Courier
Cup tourney for caddies for the second year
in succession with a card of 78. The win
also carries the title of champion caddie of
Queensland.
The N.S.W. professional golf champion-
ship resolved itself into a battle between
the brothers Don and Arthur Spence in the
final round on Saturday, the former winning
by 4 up and 3 to play at the 33rd green.
The game was played at the Australian
Golf Club course at Kensington. The
winner is professional at Leura (N.S.W.)
and his brother, who has been for some time
with the Royal Queensland club, is _on his
way to Melbourne to join up with the
Yarra Yarra club.
* * * *
“Glenelg”: Joe Kirkwood went on to Tas-
mania after his Victorian appearance and
then to Adelaide, where he has been showing
at Kooyonga with Ivo Whitton, Rufus
Stewart, Legh Winser and others. Sydney
will see him again on his return to catch
the boat for America. Joseph is donating a
cun for the professional championship of
Australia, a tourney that lias long been
overdue in Australian golf. Kirkwood de-
sires that the British and American method
of playing this class of competition, two
rounds stroke and the leading 16 to play off
under match conditions, be observed, and this
will probably be the case.
“Colonel Damurize”: We have had a lot of
fantods introduced into golf by Americans
lately; some of them, such as the woodeu
tee and the ball stamp, have been adopted
in Australia, I have just heard of another
which seems to have a lot to recommend it.
This is the stroke counter, an apparatus
which is fastened to the wrist and functions
after the fashion of a pedometer, remorse-
lessly recording every stroke made. Pro-
vided these can be turned back to zero and
sealed, I foresee a splendid sale for them to
officials of those misguided clubs which
specialise in tournaments for their associate
members. Checking the cards of this descrip-
tion of tourney has brought many a club
secretary to the cloistered seclusion of Callan
Park or Kew.
* * * *
“The McHaggis”: The question of what
constitutes an amateur in golf has been
receiving attention from the American and
British controlling bodies, with the result
that the present definition has been practi-
cally reaffirmed —that is that no amateur
may take money for playing or teaching golf,
or be associated with the manufacture or
marketing of any golfing material. No de-
cision has yet been reached as to whether
the age up to which a boy may carry clubs
for hire without infringing his amateur
status should be 16 or 18. St. Andrews is
said to favor the former, and America the
latter.
* * * *
“Long Ball”: Bobby Jones, writing in
Golfing, gives it as his opinion that the
reason for the alleged inferiority of English
golfers as compared with their American
brethren does not lie in putting, as is gener-
ally supposed, but in driving a long ball.
English players are quite as good with the
irons, too, but with few exceptions the
Americans can outdrive them.
* * * *
“Da Oil”: It is a curious thing that
though the Italians cut a very poor figure
among the golfing peoples of Europe, they
have bulked quite largely when transferred
to the United States. Joe Turnesa, who
tied with Bobby Jones for the American
Open two years ago, is an Italian, and
so is Henri Oinchi. Most prominent of all
is ’Gene Sarazen, who won the Open in 1922,
and is still in the very forefront of Ameri-
can professional golfers. He lias had a
wonderful run of success during the past
year, and has won one tournament after
another throughout the long American season,
which, starting in the north with the sum-
mer, goes south and west till it is time to
begin all over again in the north.
:& * * *
“Stymied” : The new golf clubs in N.S.W.
(and in most other States) differ from those
of Britain inasmuch as they have only 18
holes apiece. The licensing laws forbid the
nineteenth. The result is the managements
have to get revenue by charging green fees to
members, which is as though a theatrical
management took the money for the seats
and then charged patrons for pulling the
curtain up. Nothing is gained morally by
denying the newer golf clubs the right to sell
liquor to members; they are the last places
in which the privileges would be likely to be
abused, being frequented by the female
relatives of the players and being nothing if
not circumspect. My idea is that the State
licensing laws should be amended to allow
them to sell Australian wines, beers and
spirits, thus giving a valuable form of pro-
tection to the local article without adding to
the total of intoxicants consumed. At
present “wet” golfers get there just the same
by bringing their imported spirits along
with their clubs, as they are legally entitled
to do.
“Back Spin”: Add this to the welter of
argument surrounding the proposed new stan-
dard ball. Practising recently at Kingston
Heath,' Australia’s longest course, Rufus
Stewart required a brassey for his second
shot at only one hole, the fourteenth, of
535 yards. Nine other holes of this mara-
thon course of 6657 yards measure 418 yards
or more. Three of them run out at 489,471
and 452 yards respectively. When Rufus
and other human siege-guns are able with
the present-day ball to make even our longest
courses appear lilliputian playgrounds, is it
any wonder that our committeemen and
course architects are running about with wet
towels around their heads?
"*# * *
“Deejay”: Sleepy old Campbelltown
(N.S.W.) has now one of the best golf
courses that any country town can
boast of. It’s the second attempt the first
course having had the surveyor through it
turning bunkers and greens into farmlets.
Any Saturday 40 or 50 players roll up.
D. J. Chernich is the local crack, and twice
has holed in one, both times at the Pines
hole. They have just erected a decent club-
house, and the future of the club is rosy.
It’s a democratic club, too. Most little
country-town clubs are too cliquey for the
rank and file.

Car and Cycle
“Trembler”: The final contest of the
N.S.W. Royal Automobile Club for the year,
held at Robertson (N.S.W.), took the form
of a flying half-mile, a slow run and a hill-
climb. Twenty-five cars —13 4-cylinders, 11
6-cylinders and one 8-cylinder—scored more
than 210 points out of a possible 300. or
over 70 p.c. The highest points score was
made by H. Taylor’s 4-cylinder Alvis, with
282.71, or 94 p.c. L. D. Tasker’s 6-cylinder
American L.D.T. was second with 270.67,
and Hope Bartlett’s 8-cylinder Bugatti third
with 265.19. The teams contest was won by
the Alvis group of three cars, these totalling
718.93 points out of 1000, or 80 per cent.
Three Chryslers were second with 713.78,
and the Bugattis filled third place with
699.16. Of the 25 cars 11 were American,
8 British, 3 French, 2 Italian and 1
Canadian.
* * * *
“Low”: A fine hill-climbing performance
has been credited to a stock Auburn car
with all the usual touring equipment in place.
Driven by Wade Morton, one of the best-
known of American speed-drivers, the car
made the ascent of the Pike’s Peak
mountain in record time, cutting out 121
miles in 21min. 45sec., 141 sec. better than
the previous record by a stripped car.
There are 200 sharp turns on the mountain
road, the rise of which is about 1 mile
in 12. It was possible to drive the car at
high speed at two points only, but an average
of 35 m.p.h. was maintained in second. The
last two miles were through snow.
* # # *
“M.P.G.”: One of the new straight eight
Studebakers was tried out in Queens-
land, shortly after landing, and came through
a 1700-mile run in South-Western Queens-
land with flying colors. The route taken was
from Brisbane to Charleville, and thence
through Cunnamulla and Bollon to St.
George, and thence by Goondiwimli to Bris-
bane again. Ninety per cent, of the roads
traversed were the usual bush tracks, and
for the middle portion of the run most of
them were through heavy sand-ridge country.
The average run for the whole trip was 161
miles to the gallon, and the oil, which was
changed after 1100 miles, was indistinguish-
able from new lubricant. The car ran up to
73 m.p.h. without trouble, and 62 m.p.h.
was reached on second-gear on several occa-
sions, though no attempt at speeding was
made.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Frank Arthur, the Queensland
dirt-track rider who has recently returned
from a successful season in England, put up
some outstanding figures for a quarter-mile
dirt track at Davis Park speedway in Bris-
bane the other day, cutting out one lap in
18sec., a rate of 50 m.p.h. To this he added
two new mile records, his time from a stand-
ing start being 81 l-ssec., and from a flying
break 74 2-ssec. Brisbane seems even crazier
on dirt-track racing this season than it was
last, though improvements in the track have
eliminated some of the old thrills.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: While Alec Finlay failed in
his attempt on the world’s 24-hour motor-
cycle record on the road at Cowes (Vic.),
he put up some new times for smaller times
and distances, though these have yet to be
verified. The standing figures, 1114| miles,
were put up in 1920 by another Victorian
rider, Harold Parsons. He rode a 600-e.e.
machine on a 23-mile lap, whereas Finlay
made the attempt over a 6'.57-mile course,
riding a 4.93 machine 1 . Finlay is to have
another shy at the record shortly.
❖ ❖ ❖ *
“Sprocket”: Hubert Opperman, Aus-
tralia’s crack professional cyclist, cast up
again in his native Melbourne the other day
after some months of riding in competitions
in France and elsewhere on the Continent.
The Victorian pedaller will not be long here,
for he has received offers of contracts to
appear in four different departments of
cycling in Germany, France. Belgium and
Switzerland, and will accept them. In addi-
tion, he has been asked to join the Alcyon
and Louvet teams to compete in the next
Tour de France. These are two of the lead-
ing bicycle-manufacturers’ teams, and tp be
invited to join them is a signal honor for a
foreign cyclist. Opperman will race in Tas-
mania, N.S.W. and S.A. before leaving for
Europe in February.
* $ * *
“The Pacer” : Oscar Rutt, who is coming
to Sydney for the Christmas bike-racing, is
a son of Walter Rutt. who toured Australia
in 1905 and 1906 with Meyer and Elicgard.
Walter was a great cyclist, and Oscar has
proved himself as a sprinter in U.S.A. and on
the Continent; he has beaten men of the
calibre of Pete Moeskops and Jan Kauffman.
Miscellaneous
“Hotham”: The Australian Rules football
match between Oxford and Cambridge has
now become a regular annual event. This
year’s contest, staged at Queen’s Park the
other day, resulted in a victory for the Light
Blues by 78 to 40. So far. there is no talk
of a “Blue” being granted for the game, but
even that may come to pass. A London daily
got tangled in the game’s technicalities, and
reported the scores as: Cambridge. 11 goals
12 "beehives” ; Oxford. 5 goals 10 “beehives.”
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: Soccer in England is so
bound to professionalism that recent action
by the Amateur Associations of England,
Scotland, Wiles and Ireland is to be re-
gretted. In conjunction with the Inter-
national Football Federation, which controls
Continental Soccer, a committee has been
appointed to inquire into the possibility of
permitting payments to amateurs for time lost
from employment while playing football. If
adopted, the system will inevitably open the
door to professionalism as it did in the
case of the Northern Union, which originally
countenanced broken-time payments only, and
was expelled from the English Rugby Union
in consequence. In less than two years the
N.U. had adopted out-and-out profes-
sionalism.
❖ * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: The marbles cham-
pionship appears to have become a recog-
nised American sporting event; a photograph
in the New York llekalu showed (as well
as that journal’s photographs show any-
thing) a big gallery at the “grand final” in
Philadelphia. Apparently the Yankee is pre-
pared to support any foolishness for which
gate-money is charged; he believes that any-
thing he has to pay for must bo pleasure.
But he likes to make a quick-lunch of it; a
real game like cricket, because it is long
drawn-out, fails to gain any wide popu-
larity in the States.
* * * *
“Let G 6”: The high-class tin-hare grey-
hounds sent from Australia to South Africa,
with a view to establishing the robot racing-
game there were recently offered for sale in
Durban. All were practically given away,
and 15 of them averaged a shade over two
guineas each. A local dog, Coohban, of
high-class British pedigree, for which £BO
had been refused, topped the sale at
seven guineas. The Afrikanders, who hate
anything smacking of professional sport out-
side horse-racing, have made it plain that the
tin hare will not couch on their hearthstone.
* * :|: *
“The Gaffer”: The Maoriland amateur
athletic heads have invited Jack Standen, the
cyclist, and Wl M. Whyte, the middle-distance
runner, both of them Australian Olympic
representatives, to visit the Dominion for a
six-weeks’ tour. No date has been fixed, but
the trip will probably fit in with the M.L.
annual athletic carnival, which is usually held
about Christmastime. It is to be hoped that
Whyte, now resident in Sydney, will contrive
to be back in time for a meeting with Peltzer,
the German crack, in January next. Whyte
was unable to do liimself justice at the Olym-
piad, and a meeting with the flying German
would show us how good the ex-Victorian
runner really is.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Victorian Amateur Ath-
letic Association is' easily the most alive
of Australian organisations of the kind, as
OTTO NOTHLING, the burly young
Queenslander, whose bowling in the
England v. Queensland game in Bris-
bane has enhanced his Test-match
prospects.
may be seen in the immediate steps taken
to fill the vacancy caused by the withdrawal
of the invited xVmerican athletes. An invita-
tion was sent to Dr. Peltzer, after D. G. A.
Lowe the finest middle-distance runner now
on the track, to strip in Melbourne in .Janu-
ary next. The German flier, who is in Japan,
has accepted, and will be accompanied by F.
Cortz. one of the foremost German sprinters.
Whether he will appear in other Australian
States has not yet been settled, that being
largely a matter of finance, N.S'.W. in par-
ticular being emphatic as to the size of its
cut of the “gate.”
$ * * *
“The Gaffer”: Just when we all thought
it had sunk into an unhonored grave, the
“Olympic Team Scandal” has been yanked
into the light of day again. One journal, in
announcing the determination of the Olympic
Council to hold an inquiry, alleges that an
athlete absented himself from training for a
week, which he spent in Paris in the company
of “a seductive French lady.” while yet another
is described as being "flirt-in-ordinary to
Tom. Dick and Harry on the voyage,” which
sounds intriguing, if rather mixed. Whether
the scandalous rumors are true or, as is most
probable, utterly without foundation, the
unfortunate happening should put an end
once and for all to the “mixed-team” system.
FRANK ARTHUR, the Queensland motor-
cyclist, who has made an outstand-
ing reputation as a “dirt-track” rider
in England and Australia.
Passed over in Melbourne, Frank Brown,
sporting writer for the Saturday Globe and
most picturesque, versatile and lovable of
pressmen. Brown was that rare bird, an
expert on sport who was also a genuine
athlete. A born rover, he travelled the world
on his wits, and on one occasion found him-
self absolutely broke in Bei’lin. Learning
that an athletic meeting was to be held of
such eminence that two of the Hohenzollern
family would be present, he entered for the
star running event, in the hope that some
prize-money might help to pay for his
breakfast. He found himself pitted against
a celebrated runner. When the pistol ex-
ploded Brown dashed off, but, hearing no
following footsteps, looked back, and saw
that the Teuton champion had stumbled.
Being a good sport, he promptly returned
to the starting-line, and his behavior so
delighted the Hohenzollern princeling that
a special cup was handed to him. The Aus-
tralian had a desperate struggle to get out
of Germany without taking the mark of royal
favor to the pawnshop.
*:* * * *
“Backwoodsman”: President John Scott,
of the N.S.W. Bowling Association, has been
touring the country districts of N.S.W. as a
missionary in the cause, and has had some
uplifting experiences, the countrymen in
many centres being even more fervent wor-
shippers than their confreres of the metro-
polis. The president is inclined to award the
bun for keenness to Armidale. Recently a
carnival was started there at 10 a.m. and,
going on all day, was continued by electric
light until two o’clock next morning. It
seems almost impossible, from a bowling
point of view, until one realises that the
Six O’clock Drought Act is more honored
in the breach than the observance in many
country districts, and especially in those
with an addiction to bowls.
••is * * Sis
“Bias”: The ruinous effect which the culti-
vation of “the social spirit” in bowls is
having on this once-purposeful and forthright
game (B. 14/11/’2B) is becoming every day
more apparent. There is no place for women
in bowls proper, and their recent intrusion on
its sacred mystery in N.S.W. is being marked
by the most devastating departures from the
strict ethics of the game. As an instance, I
beg to quote the account of “an open-air
dance” held at a N.S.W. club quite recently;
they danced on the sacred green itself. What
it must have looked like after an evening of
prancing high heels I forbear to conjecture.
Can anyone imagine the trustees of the Syd-
ney Cricket Ground giving a dance on the
pitch held in readiness for a coming Test
match? The desecration would be no greater
in the one case than it is in the other.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“S.T.S.” South Aus. wheat harvest
prospects have taken a jump. Early hot
winds prompted an estimate of 20 million
bushels. The crops, however, have come on
wonderfully under two months of coolness
and moisture, and the official estimate is
now 32 millions; the Register makes it
34 millions.
* * * *
“Equites”: Horse-Breeding in Queensland
has fallen on evil days since the war. In
Charters Towers recently 30 good saddle
sorts were sold for 30s. the lot, while 20
young draughts from round about Roma,
a picked lot, realised £33 10s. the bunch at
Toowoomba. Another breeder in N.Q., after
selling 48 horses for the remount trade at £4
per head, cut the throats of 200 others as
not worth the grass they were eating.
v * »}• »!»
“High Street”: The vast, belt of ti-tree in
the mid-Richmond district (N.S.W.) is about
to be exploited by a co. which has its head-
quarters at Coraki. According to experts,
the essential oil of the ti-tree is eleven
times more potent than carbolic acid and is
non-poisonous; moreover, it can be utilised
commercially for 24 purposes. Already
orders for many thousands of gallons have
been received from abroad.
* Ms Mi *
“Up North”: Is it any wonder that
opium-smuggling continues? The recent
Geneva report estimates that over 2600
ounces of Government opium are sold per day
in Hong Kong. As for illicit opium, that can
be obtained as readily and much more
cheaply'. Three years back it could be bought
in Hong Kong for ten shillings a tin, and
easily disposed of in Cairns for at least
£7. The Geneva report makes it pretty clear
that opium was never more plentiful in Ilong
Kong than it is to-day.

“Percy Pawnticket”: A census of Britain’s
millionaires estimates them on the £50,060
p.a. basis (5 per cent, on a million pounds)
at 562, with a combined income of
£55,812.000 p.a.—138 hit more than the
£lOO,OOO mark. The tax-collector’s cut is
10s. in the £ on all incomes over £30,000.
There were only 19 millionaires in the
Cold Country in 1906, but a million meant,
relatively, a great deal more in those days
than now. Nearly a score of the newer
plutocrats have made their money ont of
the new generation’s craze for silk.
* ❖ * *
“Chevroford”: As a result of a judgment
in the State Full Court there should be
great signwriting activity in motor garages
throughout Vic. A man garaged his car for
repairs in a shop where there was the usual
notice, “Every Care but No Responsibility.”
The vehicle got into a collision when the
garage boy was testing it. and on appeal
the court found that “Every Care,” implied a
contract which “No Responsibility” did not
dissolve. To put himself on the safe side
the garage owner would have to add a
statement to the effect that he took no
responsibility for negligence.
:*c iji *
“Bill Ding” : Perth City Council, which is
at last opening up the splendid municipal
endowment lands fronting the Indian Ocean,
having spent £30,000 in sluicing and level-
ling sand hills, has ordained that the settle-
ment shall be a brick and stone area. This
when there must be 200,000 loads of unsold
sawn timber stacked within 60 or 70 miles
of Perth. Our irrational prejudice against
wmoden houses is not shared by the Ameri-
cans. The Ladies’ Homs Journal recently
took a plebiscite of its readers on the ques-
tion of preference for wooden, brick and
composite homes, an(t wood beat brick,
stucco, hollow-tile and stone out of sight.

Two steamers that have seen many years’
service in the Maori land trade, the Ma-
mari, 9372 tons, and the Arawa, a sister
ship, have been sold to foreign buyers By the
Shaw Savill Co. The Mamari, launched 24
years ago, has had adventures. Twenty
years ago she crashed over in an Auckland
dock and killed several men, and last year
she ran against an iceberg. The Arawa,
21 years old, saw war service as H.M.N.Z.

“Coot”: Churchill Island, near Phillip
Island, Westernport (Vic.), is for sale. On
this island the first cultivation of Victorian
soil took place in March 1801, when Lieut.
Grant, on an expeditionary voyage to deter-
mine how far Westernport was suitable for
a settlement, cleared a few acres with a
coal-shovel, and sowed a variety of seed,
including wheat, maize, peas and rice. The
seed had been supplied to him by a farmer
in the Cold Country named Churchill, after
whom he named the island. In the following
November the island was visited by Lieut.
Murray, who found the crops flourishing.

Chatter.
Tennis is our paramount sport just now,
with inter-State and championship contests
on the courts at Kooyong. The visit of
English players gives the championships
added interest. On the first day, Friday,
Lady Stonehaven, wearing spotted attire in
blends of brown, with a biscuit-colored felt
hat, arrived early accompanied by Miss
Gillett. Mrs. Norman Brookes and her
husband gave the v-r. lady welcome. The
Tallis lady, Mrs. Arthur ISprague, Mrs.
Gerald Patterson and knights Edward Miller
and Leo Cussen were among the enthusiasts
who looked on. The weather was almost
ideal.
The Kooyong Club house on Saturday
night was the scene of a dance given by the
L.T.A.V. to honor English and inter-State
tennis players. The new ballroom, used for
the first time, was much admired, and the
great decorative masses of mixed blossoms,
arranged by Vera dc Bavay and Gwen Bedg-
good, elicited warm praise. Mayor and
Mayoress Luxton, she in cornflower-blue
draperies, joined the trippers, and president
Norman Brookes, accompanied by Mrs.
Brookes, whose rose-pink frock gleamed with
spots of crystal and steel, looked after the
visitors. Mrs. Bindley Baker had a glimmer
of crystal upon pale-blue attire, and Mrs.
Clive Miller’s frock was hidden beneath a
black-and-silver brocade coat. Dr. Gregory,
Austin and Collins, the oversea champions of
the racquet, mingled in the dance, Austra-
lian tennis being represented by Mr. and
Mrs. Bob Schlcsinger, Mrs. Gerald Patter-
son, Mrs. Cyril MacGillicuddy, who sported
a handsome crocheted wrap worked with
huge pink roses and fringed with green ; the
Noel Brodribbs and others. Elaine Linton,
in floral chiffon, and Mollie Bannister,
frocked in green shot taffeta, were dancers
of the younger set.
The visiting English tennis team drank
tea with president Norman Brookes and the
council of the Lawn Tennis Association at
the Kooyong Club Plouse on Thursday after-
noon. Mrs. Brookes sported a fawn pleated
silk skirt with jersey of blending blue and
straw hat. Mrs. Clive Miller, who is visit-
ing her home town after nine years’ absence,
was one of the guests.
The Princess of Music competition, which
is likely to add about £lOOO to the Million
Shilling Appeal for a permanent orchestra,
came to jts grand finale on Friday night
with the coronation of the winning princess
by Mayoress Luxton at the Town Hall. The
ceremony was in pageant form, the charac-
ters representing music in dance and song.
Each princess made entrance to the ball-
room accompanied by the composer she repre-
sented, and a suite of attendants. Eileen
Ilallam, a striking Spirit of Music, headed
the procession Avith kindred muses in Grecian
robes; Leonie Levy was the herald who
introduced each group, and Mrs. Finley sang
Schubert’s “Ode to Music.” A regal-looking
student of the Albert-street Con., Joyce
Young, who walked with Mozart, received
the diadem and sceptre, the contribution on
her behalf being over £323. Schubert’s prin-
cess, Isobel Carter, of the Uni. Con., was
runner-up. To Florrie Green, who produced
the well-dressed show and whose pupils
blithely ti’ipped in dances old and new, went
the honors of the evening. Workers behind the
scenes included Mrs. MacGillicuddy, hoa.
organiser ; Esther Levy, hon. secretary, with
Kath Rogers Thomson and Bertha Schwartz
as assistants; Mrs. Herbert Brookes, presi-
dent of the appeal; and the Morell lady.
Mrs. Edward Stevens and Mrs. Reynolds
Lewis were two local composers who had
places in the spectacular show.
Moonee Valley racecourse attracted a fairly
large crowd on Saturday afternoon, when
proceeds were for the V.R.C. Benevolent
fund. The weather was on its best behavior,
and the course, with its well-kept lawns and
flower-beds, looked very pleasant. A fresh-
ness in the breeze made ensemble modes
more popular than airy georgette and lace
frocks. The W. Rogers Thomsons and Kath-
leen, Prof, and Mrs. A. Gunn, the Clive
Leonards and Dr. and Mrs. Murray Morton
were there; also Miss T. Fenner, who intro-
duced Lady Headley to the charms of
Moonee. Of course A. V. Kewney and his
wife and the Hiskens family were present.
The Rotarians’ president, Thomas Baker,
and his wife gave a garden party for mem-
gers and some others on Saturday at Morn-
ington, in the original home of the Grice
family. Gum-trees border the lengthy drive
that leads to a gorgeous garden sloping down
to the bay, and tame wallabies hop here and
there. Owing to illness, the host was un-
able to give the hand of welcome, but Mrs.
Baker and her sisters, the Misses Shaw,
made things pleasant for everyone. No in-
troductions were necessary, since each guest
was ticketed with his or her name. The
weather was perfect, and a band played
cheerily as tea w r as served beneath huge um-
brellas on the lawns. Fred Birks, the direct-
ing governor of Rotary, came from Sydney
for the party; and other folk who attended
were Prof. W. A. Osborne, the H. J. Man-
sons, Captain Davies, who went with Shack-
leton to the Antarctic, Commander and Mrs
Ireland and his wife, Commander and Mrs.
Creswell and their daughter Jan, the L. S.
Benjamins, the G. S. Sleights, and Colonel
and Mrs. W. K. F'ethers.
Lady Stonehaven gave the two-days’ Poster
Fair at the 1t.V.1.8. a push off on Thursday.
The aim of the show, which had Mrs. Jim
Angus at the helm, was to finance the estab-
lishment of a hostel for blind boys, similar
to the comfortable residence of the girls learn-
ing or employed at a trade at the institute.
Her Ex. wore flowered voile of jacaranda
blue and millinery to harmonise, and the
flowers handed her by Mrs. Angus blended
exactly. Mayoresses of many municipalities
presided over the stalls spread out on the
lawn, and several of the chorus of “The
Desert Song” co., in stage uniforms of the
French Legion and Spanish dresses, with
some Totem ballet-girls from Foy and Gib-
son’s, joined in the parade of living posters
and lent a hand with the sales. A sudden
shower of rain threatened to spoil the sport,
but it was short-lived and no damage was
done. Concerts at night by the blind pupils
helped to swell the coffers.
Mrs. Norman Brookes, wearing soft
fabric and lace of biege hue, was hostess
at a tea party at Mcnzies’ one after-
noon last week. The tennis champion's
wife, who is president of the Queen Vic-
toria Hospital, during her recent holiday
abroad incpiired into English hospital
methods and was much struck with the
thorough assistance given to out-patients and
discharged patients to enable them to carry
out medical orders. These beneficiaries are
known as almoners. Guests invited to chat
over the matter were drawn from councils
and committees of charitable institutions, and
secretary Love, of the Charities Board, who
has studied the almoner system, read exten-
sive notes on the subject. Many others, in-
cluding Dr. It. R. Stawell, Mrs. G. G.
Henderson and Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
promised xheir co-operation in establishing
something on similar lines here.
Since marriage gives a woman the nation-
ality of her husband, here’s a new Australian,
Mrs. John Brownlee, who up to November
2S was the Contessa Carla di Faletto of
Turin. Triple
ceremonies—a
civil wedding
and two church
services in
Paris were
necessary, t o
securely link
Geelong’s opera
star with his
Italian bride.
The baritone’s
contract at the
Paris Opera
House permit-
ted of only
three days’
hone ymoon.
Cables and
beam were
kept busy con-
vey i n g con-
gratulations
from Austra-
lian friends
who had rejoiced in Brownlee’s triumphs dur-
ing the recent grand-opera season in the
Commonwealth.
Ex-students of Toorak College and parents
and relatives of the pupils of to-day assembled
at Frankston for the formal opening of the
new school. Lady Someirs laid the foundation-
stone for the then well-advanced buildings
last April, and Lord Somers did the key-
turning. The school had no permanent
tenure of its former site, and was in danger
of extinction, but many friends interested
themselves on its behalf and brought about
the move to the wooded hillside overlooking
the sea, just outside the fashionable holiday
resort. Built on the most modern plan, the
new buildings provide accommodation for
130 boarders. There are 21 acres of land,
most of which is laid out in gardens and
playing fields, with a bit of virgin bush.
The property cost £50,000, and is in charge
of the three former principals, the Misses
Hamilton. Some of the folk in the limelight
at the opening were the acting-president of
the council, Norman Brookes, Mrs. Brookes,
George Russell, chairman of directors, Mrs.
Russell, the Donald Mackinnons, Mrs. Frank
Faulkiner (pres, of the 0.G.A.) and Mrs.
Oscar Lempriere.
Three charity organisations—Dame Nellie
Melba Free Kindergarten, the Women’s Hos-
pital and the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children—divided the proceeds
of a two-nights’ season of Eric Hudson’s
“The Unfair Sex,” produced at the Play-
house by Ray Whiting. Leading players
were Mrs. George Bell, Marjorie Kimpton,
Natalie Wood, Joy Turner, Keith Johns,
Ron Nettlefold and Esmonde Jones —the last-
named lately signed up with the Boucicault
co. The committee of management had
Mayoress Luxton as president and Mrs.
A. E. Kimpton and Mrs. H. S. Gullett, wife
of the new Minister of Trade and Customs,
as lion, organisers. Mrs. T. A. Tabart was
lion, treas. Mayor Luxton, Mrs. Herbert
Brookes, Mrs. J. L. Carnegie and Mavis, the
Morell lady, and Mrs. J. Purves, with
Valerie, were first-nighters.
Here is Beatrice, daughter of Commander
and Mrs. E.
M. Ilussey-
Cooper, of
►South Yarra.
The clever
young miss
was chief engi-
neer of the
bright show
“It,” given at
the Athenaeum
recently, which
added £155 to
the funds of
the Austin
Hospital. She
is shortly re-
turning to
England with
her parents,
and feels
rather sad at
the- prospect of
parting with
Australian
friends, for the family l-esided in Sydney for
seven years before coining to Melbourne. The
picture is by Spencer Spier.
Canberra Housewives’ Association, which
hitherto lias been lying dormant or couchant
or something like that, shook off dull sloth
the other day, and held a show of women’s
work which covered necdlecraft, baking, gar-
dening and every other home activity. Two
hundred entries were all that were expected
in the promoters’ rosiest dreams, but more
than a thousand came to hand. The Butters*
lady said the opening words, and Mrs. Brack-
enrig and other leading lights of the C.H.A.
were well to the fore. Mrs. Lane Poole, whose
talents have hitherto been devoted to house-
decoration and embroidery, has turnfed her
hand to kitchen-gardening, and carried off
prizes for beans, tomatoes and other vege-
tables. One result of the show is the resur-
rection by the menfolk of the Canberra Hor-
ticultural Society, which hasn’t shown signs
of life for about four years.
Though Thursday was billed as a gala
night of “The Desert Song” co. at the
Prince’s, with Lance Fairfax as host, theat-
ricals were conspicuous by their absence
from the party. Someone had forgotten
to post mummers’ invitations until the
eleventh hour. Stephanie Deste, wearing a
hooped lengthy gown of ivory flowered
taffeta, and the Red Shadow were the only
stage folk to respond. Visitors received num-
bered photographs of the star mummer.
Some numbers were lucky, and entitled their
possessors to dainty French dolls. The
maiden receiving a blue-dressed doll could
claim the first dance with the host. Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Wenman, she in black lace;
Mr. and Mrs. Major ; Kathleen Rogers Thom-
son, in frilled frock of cherry-red hue; and
Norma Brennan, clad in glistening white,
were dancers.
Mrs. Tom Hudson’s picturesque home at
South Yarra housed at the week-end an
exhibition of pottery by Merric Boyd.
Mayoress Luxton spoke the openings words,
and the potter’s small daughter Lucy handed
over the posy of thanks. The beautiful
wares were arranged in the lounge and bil-
liard-room, and included jugs, jars and bowls
of graceful form decorated with wind-swept
gum-trees and an occasional native-bear.
Mr. Boyd has deserted his once-favorite
greens and browns in favor of shades of blue,
pink and mauve and metallic effects.
The show and sale of goods manufactured
by Henrietta Walker and her assistants, at
the ballroom of No. 9, attracted much atten-
tion. She exhibited articles fashioned from
bark, moss, fungi, seeds, berries and other
products of our bush. Her mats and baskets
of plaited bark intermingled with flax and
raffia have been on the market for some time,
and she is always endeavoring to find new
uses for such materials. To the show were
added stalls containing the work of invalid
soldiers and nurses—mostly articles suitable
for presentation at Christmas. Lady Somers
being precluded from attendance by illness,
the Miller lady opened the exhibition, and
was handed a posy by Mrs. H. B. Higgins
The Anglo-American entente of the
E.-S.TJ. at No. 9 was an event of Friday
night. Mrs. Harold Clapp, in black velvet,
and Norme Collins, wearing a frock of pale
gold coloring, were mostly responsible for
the management of the hop, which 'vas
attended by the Consul for U.S.A., T. H.
Robinson, whose wife was in a pink robe
embroidered in white beads, and Trade-
Commissioner S. P. Peabody as official guests.
A knot-tying of last week was that of Alice,
fourth daughter of the late John Swanson
and his lady, and Rupert Douglas, only son
of the A. W. Reids of Geelong. The ceremony
took place at the Church of England Gram-
mar School chapel, and the bridal raiment
was white crepe satin with train of white
tulle over pale pink, topped by veil of net
and Honiton lace. A sheaf of water-lilies
was carried. Nancy Swanson and Grace
Reid attended in frocks having a glow of
faint pink beneath fawn silk lace, with har-
monising millinery.
Picture-actress Louise Lovely took her
second plunge into matrimony last week
with Bert Cowen, manager-elect of the not-
yet-finished Regent Theatre. When, as
Louise Carbasse of Sydney, she married Wil-
ton Welch, from whom the Law gave her
release over 18 months ago, the pretty mum-
mer was under 16, and she is still youthful.
Wearing ensemble of shell-pink and ermine
edging, with blending of felt millinery, she
looked charming as she made responses before
the Registrar. Dr. and Mrs. Barry Thom-
son gathered up a few friends and the bride-
groom’s relatives for a hurried after-celebra-
tion at their flat at Cliveden Mansions. Mrs.
Norman Menzies (Dorothy Vane that was),
the Charles Wenmans, Muriel Starr and May
Collins gave the party a theatrical flavor.
Almond-green frocks and large felt hats
of the same shade were worn and fans of
pink flowers were carried by the three maids
of Barbara Wilson when she exchanged vows
with Harry Watt at Scots’ Church last
week. The bride, younger daughter of the
C. Wilsons of Royal Park, dressed the role
in an almost full-length gown of white satin
with a tulle veil anchored to a wide brow-
band of orange buds and glitter.
This is a gentle reminder that to-morrow
(Thursday) afternoon there will be a bridge
and concert party at the Town Hall to pro-
vide Christmas fare and fun for patients of
St. Vincent’s Hospital.
Lord Somers showed his interest in bari-
tone Alban Whitehead by going to the
young student’s farewell ' concert at the
Town Hall on Saturday night. Mr. White-
head, who has Dame Nellie Melba’s influ-
ence to back him, is to study with John
Brownlee’s teacher. The Melbourne Sym-
phony Orchestra, under Fritz Hart’s baton,
contributed to the programme.
Banker Lord Hillingdon and his lady will
visit the Federal capital this week as guests
of the G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven at Gov-
ernment House. The Hon. Penelope Mills,
their 11-year-old daughter, has for the last
two weeks been residing at Canberra’s vice-
regal residence, palling up with the Stone-
havens’ small girls.
Many friends of Fred Hagelthorn, ex-
M.L.C., formerly Minister for Public Works
and Agriculture, felt a pang of regret when
they heard of the death of his wife last
week 1 . When Mr. Hagelthorn was a Minister
and lived in a stately home in Coonil-cres-
cent, Malvern, she was a friendly and
gracious hostess. The house is now St.
Benedict’s Private Hospital.
Hannah Michael, after spending the last
year in acquiring European impressions, has
returned to her St. Kilda home in time to
celebrate her 21st birthday in the family
circle 1 . She is a niece of popular Phil
Flnkelstein, and he and his wife helped to
swell the gathering at the Palms, at which
the health of the new elector was toasted
between dances.
The Repertory Society celebrated last week
the centenary of Leo Tolstoy. Dr. A.
Pat kin, a compatriot of the famous Russian
philosopher, read a paper, and several short
dialogues from Tolstoy’s plays were given
by director Frank Clewlow and mem-
bers of the society.
The Tivoli is now quite the smartest of
the J.C.W. theatres. Interior decorators have
glorified it with Oriental traceries in pigeon-
egg green and red and gold, and a purple cur-
tain banded with gold satin and adorned
with a couple of large baskets of creamy
blossoms parts gracefully to usher in each
turn.
Harry Osborne’s daughter Rosemary will
get her first impressions of life in the Orient
as a guest at the Indian bungalow of Colonel
and Mrs. Hartley, our visitors of last sea-
son. At the expiration of her visit she will
go to Europe to join her mother, who is wait-
ing. to pilot her only daughter through a
social season abroad. As Miss Osborne grew
up in the Grey Country, she will be greeted
by lots of friends on the other side.
Sister Blanch, lately returned after some
years abroad, found a profitable field for her
services on the gay shores of the Riviera,
where ailing rich of all nations sought her
ministrations. Finally she found herself
a patient in a nursing home, and has re-
turned to Australia to recuperate and to visit
her mother, a Mildura resident. Meanwhile
her trousseau, accumulated in France, is
being admired by many envious friends.

Dr. Louisa Garrett Anderson, known to
thousands of Australian 1 lingers as the sur-
geon in charge of the Endell-street Military
Hospital in London, was welcomed at a lunch
spread in David Jones’s by the Anzac Fel-
lowship of Women. Dr. Mary Booth was
mainly responsible for the gathering; and,
as most of Sydney’s women doctors and
writers had been anxious to meet the Over-
seas lioness, Dr. Mary deserves and now
gets a cheer.
Dr. Louisa, who is the daughter of Eng-
land’s first woman doctor, Elizabeth Garrett
Anderson, and a niece of Dame Millicent
Fawcett, the suffragette who stalked the
sleep of Prime Ministers and headed many
a procession in Hyde Park, is a slim handful
of a creature, with a quiet voice and tired
eyes. Her method of address is the direct.
Of the suffragette movement she said: “It
was a fierce furnace through which we
passed, but it welded women together.” She
told how Endell-street got a great share
of the A.1.F.-ers because they were so nice
with the women doctors and the V.A.D.’s.
They were, Dr. Louisa declared, the easiest
of all to manage, and without exception
physically the finest body of men she had
ever seen. Already some of her old patients
have linked up with her. One man saw her
standing outside 52 Macleay-street, and knew
her again. And messages of welcome have
been pouring in every day.
So brief and to the point wore the
speeches—Dr. Mary Booth, Dr. Lucy Gul-
lett and Mrs. Muscio were other speakers
that the lunch was over at two o’clock. And
if that s the result of votes for women,
then the suffragettes wrought a greater
reform than even they knew. The Premier’s
wife brought her Shirley to view the great:
and Dr. Constance D’Arcy, Dr. Mary Bur-
fitt, Dr. Harriet Biffin and Dr. Kate Knowles
were a few of the women medicoes who
murmured Hooray!
. The Royal Colonial Institute has changed
its name for the more spacious title of
Royal Empire Society. But there’s an atmo-
sphere about the christening of 60 years ago
that the modern one lacks. To match its
new name, and because the nice old rooms
in Bligh-street are no longer large enough
for the big yearly gathering, last week’s end-
of-tlie-year flutter was housed in David
Jones’s. Here, though friendliness reigned,
the sense of intimacy about the parties in
the society’s own rooms was completely shat-
tered.
A feature of the big rally is the presenta-
tion of the prizes for the school essays on the
Greatness of Empire. This year, as on the
previous two, the £5 ss. and the medal for
Class A were plucked by James Moffatt, of
Church of England Grammar. Australian
social and political ideals, their origin and
application, was the subject of the discourse,
and most of it would be news to many a
politician who has climbed far and held
long to office. Nancy Adams, of the Chats-
wood C. of E. Grammar, carried off the
second prize. Two youngsters from River-
view were the other successful essayists.
Lieut.-Governor Cullen handed out the
awards with appropriate words, and Hugh
Denison, who is the chief steersman of the
society, explained its inner meaning. Then
flashlights took pot-shots at the brightly-
plumaged covey, ginger-beer corks were
drawn and jazz flashed out its jagged rhythm
in invitation.
Hugh Denison’s lady, as usual, was belle
of the party, in amethystine velvets. She
was all lit up with pearls and diamonds, and
her georgette wrap was a trifle worth pawn-
ing. Black and silver enfolded Mrs. Bavin,
who was under the wing of son John; Ailsa
Cullen supported her father, in swaying
ivory laces; and Mrs. F. D. McMaster’s sky-
after-rain blue georgettes had a floating
shoulder-drape. American Consul Lawton’s
wife ruffled in black tulle and gold lace,
while the. bride of Dr. Joseph Foreman was
sheathed in beads of many colors, intersected
with, blazing lines of diamente. Civic Com-
missioner John Garliek’s wife and Mrs. Hugh
Armitage hobnobbed over the ices. Surgeon
Howard Bullock took the floor with Mrs.
Bullock, and the Harvey Suttons were an-
other medicated couple who showed their
fervor for Empire. Olive Kelso King and
sister Hazel made a pretty composition for
a. water-colorist in their softly-blending
pink-and-ivory frocking. Ruth Beale was
there, and Mrs. Richard Arthur. Sydney
hospital’s Matron Ivellett was one of the
handsomely-blacked. All the Consuls, in-
cluding him for Germany, made their bows.
Nile green, blue of the lotusi, gold
scrolls, silver anklets—they mingled and
broke apart and mingled and chimed as the
waiters and waitresses of the Wentworth
sped about the task of serving Thanksgiving
turkey to jubilant America on Thursday
night. To have a pretty lady of the harem
serve a discreetly dressed oyster caus'ed
many a hundred-per-cent. American an
exotic sort of thrill; to have Katalina in
coral-red trousers, ankle-length and very full,
hand out your favorite Egyptian or Turkish
made the land of minarets and mosques seem
the desirable place for a tired-out business
man’s next vacation. Waiters dressed as
sheiks charged across the floor, not for the
purpose of eloping with fair ladies, but to
minister Scotch and soda to men as dry as
the Sahara. For Thanksgiving Day itself
had been a breathless uncorker, and the
Wentworth was even as a well in the desert.
The whole cafe has been redecorated in an
Egyptian scheme, and from th e great blue
jars at the entrance to the Palm Court a
piling up of detail created the atmosphere.
Near the stage, all gold and rose, stand two
enormous gold jars—the sort that Ali Baba
found so useful- when he drowned the 40
robbers in boiling oil.
The wives, mothers and best girls of the
Americans in Sydney came in force and in
raiment that th e Queen of Sheba might
have envied. And their Australian friends
were not out of the race. Take the black
lace frock of Mrs. Stuart Doyle, for instance,
and her jewels, the ermine scarf of Mrs. A.
C. Berk, or the burgundy chiffon velvets of
the wife of the newly-arrived St. John of
the “talkies,” Mrs. Maclean. The Consul-
General and his wife held court at a great
round table at the end of the room, Mrs.
Lawton in mushroom-pink laces. The
fragile-looking Mrs. Audette wore lilac
georgette sprayed with crystal, and the tail
blonde Mrs. Mortimer Richards wore
black georgettes blazed with Masonic-look-
ing squares in gold sequins. Young Mrs.
Mark Foy was among the revellers, Percy
Hunter hobnobbed with Brigadier-General
Lloyd and Mrs. Liddell sat with a young
viking, who turned out to be her naval-
lieutenant son. Mrs. Hal Carleton danced
like a thistledown in layers of honey gold
tulle. Harley Moseley squired a party of
young society buds, notable among them
Jean Anderson, as slim a$ a lily stem in
her green swathings. Mollie Street, too, was
in this group in beflowered chiffons,
Audrey Hordern in black lace and Ann
Jamieson in rainbow-frilled tulle. Miss 1 Hill
an American visitor, was a guest of honor.
Pretty Marjorie Jacobson was as expen-
sively dressed as ever; and Mrs. Spencer
Watts proved that the dancing floor held
no more difficulty for her than the golf
course. John Kennebeck, secretary, treasurer
and acting president of the American Society,
supported by his wife, dispensed hospitality
to a great party, in which glowed the golden
head of actress Rowena Ronald. Captain
Trask, of the Sierra, dropped in for a bite;
and General Motors contributed an untiring
set of dancers to the floor.
“The King” was drunk with fervor, while
the bandsmen poured forth “God Save.” Later
came the inspiring “Star Spangled Banner”
with “The President”; And such was the
happy feeling of the night that Harley
Moseley, who supplies Eureka vacuums to
Sydney, drank the toast as fervently as
though the new President’s name was not
Hoover.
Dorise Hill (alongside) is collecting for
a library for the deaf and dumb children
at Darlington,
and books suit-
able for kid-
dies between
the ages of 5
and 16 are
eagerly sought.
No matter if
they have
torn covers,
for the kind-
hearted girl
has under-
taken to put
neat backs or
fronts or both
on them be-
fo r e sending
them to the
i n s t itution.
Miss Hill will
take delivery
at her own
library, the
Pickwick Club
in Her Majesty’s Building, Pitt-street. The
Girl in the Flat Opposite says the name
should be the Quickpick Club, because the
business woman can dash in there, change her
book and devour a sandwich and a cup of
tea all within the same room.
The outstanding things in the Christmas
exhibition of the Women’s Handicrafts Asso-
ciation opened by Mrs. Florence Taylor were
the stitchery and the shell flowers. Undies
so dainty and fragile they seemed as though
wrought by fairy hands were displayed by
several members of the society. Hankies that
a cold would desecrate flirted exquisite eye-
letted or embroidered corners at the passer-
by. One set of pale yellow crepe-de-Chine
pyjamas set this Letter burning for a pas-
sage to Europe by the Orford; anything less
luxurious couldn’t live up to that sleeping-
suit. But, then, if one had it, the only thing
to do would be to stay awake all night to
admire it. The shell-flowers bloomed on a
table in the centre of the room. It seemed
at a first glance that the daughters of Nep-
tune were holding a flower show at the bottom
of one of the rainbow lagoons of Papeete
beloved of Frederick O’Brien. However, the
shells have been picked up on the beaches
around Sydney, and some are centred with a
tiny pearl and some with a trembling wisp
of seaweed. Perhaps Mary Mary Quite Con-
trary’s garden bloomed in such wise, and
after that she wasn’t contrary at all. The
batik work of Vida Tait called forth loud
ohs of admiration, scarves of hand-painted
silk floated fi*om the stand of Mrs. I*. A.
Hilder, and the old, new-fashioned Barbola
work was a striking exhibit.
Say how-do-you-do to the caddies’ good
friend. She is Mrs. A. Spencer Watts, asso-
ciate captain of the Australian Golf Club,
Kensington, and it was she who organised
the Caddies’ match the other week at Moore
Park and made such a success of it. First
of all Mrs.
Watts had in-
t e n d e d t h e
match to be
fought out by
the caddies of
Ivensi ngto n
only. Bu t
when i't wais
decided tlia t;
the play would
be on the
Moore Park
links, she de-
cided to give
the budding
Kirkwoods of
the more cos-
mopolita n
course a chance
to display their
cunning with
the wood and
the Ron. So
that there
would be no sense of club rivalry, Mrs. Warts
decided on separate trophies, and that meant
double prize-money. Nearly 70 boys com-
peted, and as some arrived with their own
caddies Mrs. Watts was thankful for the
80 lunch cartons she had ordered.
Out to the Palais at Moore Park went half
(or so) of Sydney midway through last week
to help the appeal for the Picton Lakes T.B.
settlement. Because they had given their
name and their patronage to the dance, the
Navy, the Army and the Air Force were
strongly l’epresented among the dancers; and
so that jealousy might not tear the vitals
of any group of our defenders the committee
saw that representatives of each should be
guests of honor. Rear-Admiral Hyde and
Captain Cayley were there for the Navy, and
when they entered the stirring chords of
Rule Britannia smote the quivering air.
Brigadier-General Lloyd was the military
nabob of the entertainment, while Kingsford
Smith and Charlie Ulm typified the Air
Force. No doubt suitable outbursts from
the band heralded their approach, but this
Letter was too busy admiring the cannon of
red roses and cornflowers, the battleship of
lilies and the aeroplane of. red roses which
threatened death in the sweetest possible
manner to the enemy. After 10 long years of
the League of Nations, after disarmament
pacts and what not, even this gentle hint of
the nation’s claws can give the unrighteous a
thrill of danger held at bay. The president
of the committee was Dr. Maitland’s widowed
lady, and the success of the dance proved
again that whatsoever her hands find to do
they do well. Her wrap was a nocturne in
blue and silver; her sister was busy and
efficient in cool-as-morning-sands lace and
georgette. Mrs. Leo Quick was a swirl of
royal-blue georgettes, and lorelei green
enwrapped Mrs. Grant Hanlon, whose hus-
band is organising the appeal.
Last week’s hot days brought a recurrence
of the evening drought throughout the North
Sydney suburbs. Girls who rushed home
from shop and office ready to leap into a
bath before dashing out for the evening’s
fun were met by taps that gurgled and
cooed but refused to do the job they were
invented for. One young woman of this
Letter’s acquaintance prepared for a dinner-
dance with one small cup of water, a half-
bottle of eau-de-Cologne and a dash of gin.
The gin wasn’t for inside use either. The
Water Board, as arrogant as most elected
bodies with no election in sight, says that,
despite something (as usual) gone wrong,
there’s 95 gallons per day per head. But
does it matter to an irate, dusty and hot
female whether the Water Board or the
miserable worms she had thought her friends
with gardens on the lower levels are to blame
for her condition? Not a hoot!
Little St. Thomas's at Enfield, one of the
oldest Church of England tabernacles about
Sydney, was an island almost entirely sur-
rounded by flowers on Saturday. There
surely never were more wreaths at a Sydney
funeral than when William Tilley went to
his long home. Around the coffin they were
piled high; along part of the walk from
church-door to grave they made a fragrant
hedge; at the head of the grave itself they
were spread in wide beds. And not all pale
lilies, either. The widow’s wreath, which
alone accompanied the coffin to the grave,
was of fragrant dark-red roses; and from
other clusters of roses a fragrance spread
over the great crowd of city men who heard
the service first in the church and later
before the open grave. This was alongside
the narrow bed of that other great flower-
lover, Arthur Yates. For many years they
were neighbors at Burwood.
A gentle old lady, Mrs. Margaret Stuart
Moon, who died last week, had spent 94 of
her 98 years in this State. She arrived
with her parents in 1834 by the North Bri-
ton, and grew up in West Maitland, where
here father was the first manager of the
Commercial Bank. Her husband, whom she
survived by many years, was the late Dr.
John Moon. Her greatest thrill was being
one of the first women to travel by the old
Zig-zag railway over the Mountains; but,
most marvellous of all in this age of hot
novels and smoked glasses, she did the finest
of needlework until her last illness.
The theatrical Carrolls are making a
Christmas reunion in Sydney, whitner E.J,
who has been doing big theatrical deeds in
London, is coming for the occasion. Mrs.
John Carroll, mother of the family, is staying
with Dan at his Macleay-street address; it
is her first visit to Sydney. The old lady
arrived in Australia 05 years ago with her
husband, and, settling in Ipswich, stayed
there. E.J. and Dan, who started in the
produce business in the Queensland town, and
from an initial successful venture in pictures
have extended to their present big theatrical
dimensions, are only two of a large family
—there arc five other sons and three
daughters.
St, James’s, the fashionable marriage mart,
will spill out its red carpet on the 12th
for Crystal Gilder, of Byrnblc, and Charles
Grear, of Wellington (MX.). The Bishop
of Gippsland will tie this knot, and the cake
will be cut at the Wentworth.
Two sources of future income to the clergy
are Ellie E. Moses, of Ivillara, and Sylvia
Lundgren, of Drummoyne. Ellie is the
youngest daughter of the F. A. Moses couple,
and her just-proclaimed young man is Gavin
W. Cobcroft, of Castlefield, Edgecliff. Sylvia
Lundgren went further afield for ' her
romance; it was while travelling she met and
decided to marry Hans Snndstrom, elder son
of Admiral and Mrs. Snndstrom, of Stock-
holm, Sweden.
Still another of the marrying Watts sought
benefit of clergy at St. Martha’s last week.
This time it was daughter Joan who stepped
to the altar on the arm of Andy Watt, K.C.,
and Michael Meagher, son of the Mick
Meaghers of Bathurst, awaited her with the
ring. The wedding frock was built on the
Lanvin line, and was short in the bodice and
full and flowing in the skirt, which was
edged the whole of its ivory satin sweep with
Duchess lace. The Court train was swung
from the shoulders and spattered with
orange buds. A tulle veil of great circum-
ference and a sheaf of Madonna lilies helped ,
to make up the expensive whole. Following
her along the aisle blooming with pink gladi-
oli and soft hydrangea-heads, floated sister
Meg, Phyllig Bragg and Marian Lipscombe.
Their primrose chiffons dipped at the sides
in the newest way, and had dashing bolero
bodices. The Strathfield Town Hall was
needed to hold the multitude of guests who
came from three States, and the congratula-
tions were breathed amid a riot of roses,
gladioli and carnations, all in the palest pink
and blue. The bride’s mother deserves honor-
able mention for her beige lace and satin
frocking. which was worn with a hat of beige
felt appliqued in lace.
Two of Sydney’s girl tennis stars scintil-
lated at a Burwood wedding last week, when
inter-State-player Mary Elliott was the
bride and Daphne Akhurst led the brides-
maids. . A full bui’st of choral music greeted
the bride, at the door of St. Paul’s, and,
accompanied her begemmed white chiffons
and clouds of tulle to the altar, where
Grahame Edgar, of Summer Hill, waited.
The three ’maids were softly pink, from their
satin shoes to their Baku hats. Their rose-
pink begonia armlets cascaded to the hem
of their skirts. At the reception in the
Strathfield Tow r n Hall, the bride’s mother
wore black lace over pale-pink chiffon.
Last week St. John’s, at Darlinghurst,
blessed the link that binds Patricia Bowes,
of Bondi, to Alfred Goninan, of Newcastle.
Soft, white satin and georgette were allied
in the wedding-dress, over which flowed a
pretty lace veil, worked by the bridegroom’s
mother. Two bridesmaids, in cloud-like pink,
carrying pink gladioli and roses floated in
the procession. Romano’s spread the wed-
ding breakfast, under the direction of Mr.
and Mrs. L. O. Bowes.

Rheumatism
AFFECTS THE HEART
Backache Makes You Old
13 ‘
IN a Ministry of Health report, Sir George Newman says
that almost all deaths from heart disease in people
under 40 are due to rheumatic infection. Rheumatism,
is usually due to uric-acid poisoning, as also are most forms
of Backache, Joint Pains, Stiff Shoulders and Swollen
Limbs. These troubles make you look and feel old years
before your time —and they are often dangerous. There
are several good remedies, but the most effective is un-
doubtedly Harrison’s Pills

Harrison’s Pills act quickly on the real cause of the trouble, as
well as giving prompt, sure relief to the painful symptoms.

The Women’s Club gave a Christmas party
amidst clusters of holly berries, scarlet rib-
bons, garlands of evergreens and gay posters
of Christmas scenes. Mrs. F. H. Wedd was
Father Christmas, and handed down presents
from a Christmas-tree. Fancy dress was
worn by most of the members, some wearing
dresses copied from photographs of them-
selves as kiddies. There was a scene from
the Mad Hatter’s tea party, and Freda Bage,
in a juvenile role, gave a recitation.
The Schubert Centenary concert, arranged
by E. R. B. Jordan in conjunction with the
State orchestra and Austral Choir, came to
an untimely end. After the first half of the
programme the lights in the Exhibition Con-
cert Hall failed, and the audience amused
itself Avith community singing before filing
out. J. E. England uplifted his fine baritone
in “The Erl King,” G. Danniells tenored, and
Beatrice Pugh and Hilda Hobbs were the
women soloists. The Mayor and Mayoress
were there.
The seaside home of the City C.W.A. had
a big party to celebrate the third anniver-
sary of the settlement of Linga Longa as a
health resort for mothers and kiddies from
the West and other inland spots. Mrs. Peter-
son and Mrs. Plumridge received, and the
little Tweedale maid presented Mayoress
Jolly with a posy of carnations. Gay red and
orange cannas decorated, and the two-tiered
birthday cake was made and donated by Miss
Strong, of Highfields, Toowoomba. The home,
which when it began had three bedrooms,
now has 13 and several large sleeping-out
verandahs. Over 500 grown-ups and kiddies
have stayed there this year.
The Gonsalez Opera Co. opened its sea-
son at the Empire with “Lucia di Lammer-
moor,” and the crowd of first-nighters was
large and enthusiastic. In the audience were
Chief Justice and Mrs. Blair, Dr. and Mrs.
Donald Cameron, Mr. and Mrs. T. O. Cowli-
shaw, Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Edwards, Mr. and
Mrs. M. L. Reading, the Percy Reays and
Morgan Lanes.
James Osborne Yates, son of Mr. and Mrs.
J. M. Yates of Toowoomba, was married
to Meg McLean in St. Alban’s Chapel, the
High School, Southport. She is daughter of
the late Donald McLean and Mrs. McLean,
Southport. The headmaster, Canon 11. H.
Dixon, did the job for his old pupil, and
roses and lilies played their part. The bride
was in ivory lace over shell pink; her hand-
’broidered Limerick-lace veil had been worn
by her grandmother, the late Mrs. R. C.
Lethbridge, Forest Vale, Mitchell. Cream
and pink roses made the bridal bouquet.
Molly Lethbridge, Joyce Macmillan and Vena
Yates were bridesmaids in forget-me-not-blue
taffetas, with blue Baku hats.
Graceville Croquet Club had a big shivoo,
with afternoon tea in the pavilion amid
vases of shasta daisies and cannas. Mrs. T.
M. Hall presented the prizes in the interval.

T. G. A. Molloy and his daughter Mrs.
Hammond gave a farewell party in honor
of Captain and Mrs. Barrett. The Molloy
home, Daylesford, was aglow with colored
lights and flowers, and a huge marquee was
spread on the lawn, where over a hundred
guests toasted the popular travellers. There
was dancing in the drawing-room, bridge
in the dining-room and smoke-room, and a
buffet on the verandah. The hostess wore
cobwebby black lace over shell-pink; her
sister, Mrs. Barrett, was in pale pinks, georg-
ette silver-beaded and a chenille bridge coat.
Among the guests were Colonel and Mrs.
Wieck. Major and Mrs. Rowell, Major and
Mrs. Boas, Captain Hall and his wife, the
Paul Barretts and their daughter Nell, the
Dave Freecorns, the Bob Dicksons, the Ron
Oldhams, Mrs. Barnett and her son Cleve,
Mrs. Marillier, Mrs. Taaffe, Dr. and Mrs.
Roy Mitchell, Kathleen Ripper and John
Hargrave.
The J. E. Barretts were entertained at
many other farewell parties before boarding
the Maloja for England. Mrs. Taaffe booked
their last night but one in Australia for a
bridge and poker evening at the Palace
Hotel. The drawing-room was a bower of
sweetly-perfumed carnations. The hostess
wore a gown of lilac georgette and lace
draperies liberally sprinkled with dewdrop
beads, the graceful skirt falling longer on one
side than on the other. Mrs. Barrett chose
lemon georgette betucked and beaded in sil-
ver, and Mrs. Hammond ciel-blue patterned
in platinum beads. Among the guests were
Mr. and Mrs. John Walsh, Mr. and Mrs.
Krauth. Mrs. Holmes, Mr. Roy Taylor and
the Eric Bakers.
“Les Cloches de Corneville” rang out mer-
rily for nine nights at His Majesty’s, and
principals and chorus of the Green Room
Club did full justice to Planquette’s music.
Thelma Neil of the big brown eyes was Ger-
maine and vivacious Renee Esler played
Serpolette.
Matthew Wilson has been given a number
of farewell adresses and presentations on his
retirement from the headmaster’s desk at
the High School, and corresponding functions
were arranged for Mrs. Wilson, one of the
biggest being a bridge party at the Karra-
katta Club, hostessed by Mrs. Stowe and
Mrs. Newberry. Mrs. Wilson sailed by the
Maloja on a holiday trip to India.
On a recent Saturday shilling buttons were
sold in thousands by willing Red Cross

Hobart.
Mayor and Mayoress Wignall held a very
cheery and informal civic reception at the
Town Hall in honor of the British Dele-
gation. Speeches were brief. Sir Hugo
Hirst, being on the sick list, had to cut the
Speck out of his itinerary, and his better
half stayed with him. Lady Duckham dele-
gated the care of her hubby to her daughter,
and remained on the mainland also. The
delegates were whirled up mountains and
down valleys, shown. salmon fisheries, and
sung and played to at the Lyceum Club, and
they proved the most pleasant guests imagin-
able. A feature of the programme was a
motor trip for the ladies, which wound up
with tea at High Peak, the C. W. Grants’
place on Mt. Wellington.
One of the smartest functions in honor of
the delegates w r as the luncheon given at
Hadley’s by the Chamber of Commerce. The
wives and daughters of delegates were invited,
and several Hobart women were asked to
meet them. Mrs. Tom Murdoch, wife of the
president of the C.C., looking very chic in
black, with large black hat, sat, with Lady
Evelyn Malcolm and Lady Clarke, at the
head table. Miss Farquhar, Miss Duckham
and others sat with Miss Iveir Murdoch.
There were so many official receptions of
the Big Four that there was little room for
private parties in the programme, but on a
Sunday afternoon the W. B. Propstings enter-
tained some of the visitors from Blighty at
their home in Augusta-road. Both drawing
and dining rooms were ablaze with roses,
and the picturesque old garden was a mass
of bloom. Among the guests were Sir Ernest
and Lady Clarke, Lady Evelyn Malcolm and
her daughter (Miss Farquhar), Elliott Lewis
and his lady, Premier and Mrs. McPhee, the
Edwin Websters, the Mosers, Mrs. W. Wolf-
hagen and Mrs. Tom Murdoch.
The Kindergarten Ball at the Continental,
with Mrs. C. W. Grant, the president, at
the head of affairs, and Mrs. Montgomery
as secretary scored a big success. There was
a large crowd of dancers, augmented, after
an official dinner that had been switched from
Government House to Hadley’s on account
of the O’Grady’s illness, by the British dele-
gates and a large party.
The youthful sage pictured here is Eric
Waterworth, one of the Speck’s few success-

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Mrs. Lavington Bonytlion, who has been
holidaying in Melbourne for a week, came
back to hostess a party at the Town Hall
for the feminine belongings of the Big Four.
A flash of warm -weather brought out sum-
mer frocks. One of the coolest was Lady
Hirst’s almond-green crepe de Chine with
its hint of color in an embroidered jumper.
Mrs. Bonytbon’s frock was black and pink
georgette topped by a sweeping black hat.
For background there were masses of flowers
from her garden at Mount Lofty-—del-
phiniums and lupins. Ruth Naylor, this
year’s Elder Scholar, sang, and proved her-
self possessed of a delightful voice l .
The ex-pupils of Whinham College, once
one of the best-known schools here but long
since defunct, have been indulging in a
re-union. The idea originated in Scotland
with G. N. Beatty, and there was a
muster of over 220 in the Town Hall. Some
of the folk present had not met for 40
years. The decorations emphasised the
school colors—red and black —and were
undertaken by Mrs. C. Dashwood, Mrs.
Angas Johnson and Mrs, Frank Wilcox.
John Cowan, in the chair, was flanked by
Dr. Angas Johnson and Walter Young.
Lady Hore-Ruthven opened the Children’s
Hospital fete —a firmly-established charitable
enterprise and a much-needed one. In the
last few years demands on space have neces-
sitated a good deal of building, necessitating
much bigger annual spending. The takings
exceeded last year’s by over £lOO.
A concert at which Charlotte Grivell sang
Ariel Shearer’s setting of “The Lady of
Shalot” was a marked success. The ban-
queting-room at the Town Hall was full,
and there was tea for everyone afterwards
with Mrs. Bonython as hostess. Harold
Parsons contributed ’cello solos.
Lady Hore-Ruthven, cool in maize-colored
georgette with a wide-brimmed hat, was
at the Oval for the Croquet and Lawn
Tennis Club’s closing day and presented
tournament prizes. As usual the croquet
championships fell to May Hill (Miss Turn-
bull was her partner in the doubles). Miss
Hill is a sister of the redoubtable Ciem.
The Con. opera class staged “Lochinvar”
—music by its conductor, Winsloe Hall, lib-
retto by Stanley Bemisted and Sam Walsh,
and lyrics by H. Haig Brown. It was an
excellent show, particularly in choral parts,
and Mrs. Harold Davies and Madame
Delmar Hall had designed and evolved some
charming but inexpensive dresses.
Recently announced engagements are
those of Itty, third daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. R. H. Pulleine and one of the most
attractive of our younger set, to Leslie,
elder son of the Napier Birkses; and of Ellie
daughter of the R. J. Rutherfords, of Medin-
die, to the Alan MacFarlanes’ son Clive.

COONARDOO.
“THE BULLETIN’S” GREAT £500 PRIZE STORY.
By-Katharine Prichard.
Illustrations
C. H. PERCIVAL.
CHITALI, Bardi and the others pulled
the charred clothing from her limbs.
The flesh showed raw where the fire
had eaten into it. Coonardoo’s loose flow-
ing hair was burnt close to her head.
Bardi stooped over her, whimpering. Chi-
tali mixed ashes tvith a piece of fat from
the salt meat hanging beside his saddle and
plastered it over the raw, burnt places on
Coonardoo’s body.
All the night Coonardoo lay moaning and
as if she were asleep beside the camp-fire.
The embers had died down beside Hugh’s
fire. At dawn he rode into the camp.
He had caught the big chestnut he was
working, and saddled him bareback. He
saddled without looking at the boys, and
went about preparing his own breakfast.
When he had finished eating he called
Chitali, handed out bread, tea and meat
for the boys and Bardi and Coonardoo. But
his face was hard and stiff, his eyes empty.
The madness had died down in him. He
was sane enough, too sane, and spoke
harshly, in a way no one in the camp had
ever heard before.
“Send Winni and Toby along with me,”
he told Chitali, “we’ll muster up to the soak.
You spread out with the others. Meet at
the old yards down by the Gap. Bardi can
look after the packs.”
“Eeh-mm.”
Chitali took the food and went back to
the boys at the other fire.
There was no thought of failing to do
as Hugh had commanded. In a little while
Winni brought the horses and was waiting
to roll Hugh’s groundsheet and pack his
gear.
But the boy’s face was heavy and sulkjn
Hugh rode off and Winni and Toby fol-
lowed behind him at a little distance. A
dead calm seemed to have descended upon
him; he could not think. He felt wide-
awake, with a curious unsleeping quality
of brain, as if he had been drugged of
every emotion. He did not reproach him-
self, could not feel ashamed; scarcely re-
membered the madness of the night before.
He felt empty; hard and still inside.
All day the boys riding with him averted
their gaze. They were silent together,
riding after and rounding up cattle, head-
ing them from the hills to the yards in
the narrow valley of Koodgeeda Gap. As
though he were an evil spirit, possessed
of a nalu, the boys kept out of Hugh’s way,
fear and mistrust in their eyes.
When he reached the Gap stockyards sun-
set was flaming out beyond the dark bluffs
of the hills, and Chitali had his beasts
yarded. Fires were going and packs
spread out.
As stars glittered and darkness closed in
on the camp, Hugh realised, without search-
ing, that Coonardoo was not there. Where
was she? What had they done with her?
He did not ask. She would be all right,
he told himself. She was too tough, too
used to endurance to come to any harm.
Her fortitude was equal to anything.
He was aware that for the next few
days his instructions were being carried
out rigorously, with unsmiling exactitude.
The boys worked silently, as a matter of
course, without any of the usual gusts of
laughter and good-humored rivalry amongst
them. For the next two days Hugh
branded and earmarked calves, turned off
cows and calves and held fat bullocks for
the road.
Still Coonardoo did not come into the
camp. Where she was he did not know.
Her horse was missing. Hugh would not
allow himself to think of her, to ask ques-
tions about her. But he began to remem-
ber what had happened by the fire that
night, to be ashamed of the brutal way
he had treated her.
It was Geary he had to reckon with,
he told himself, coming along like that
and making free with his house and his
women. Well, that was done with, any-
how. There would be no more talk of
Coonardoo as his woman, no more fighting
the old hankering after her.
But what had the boys done with her?
Where was she? Hugh slept lightly; he
heard Winni steal off to make his way
through thick scrub along the ranges to
where Coonardoo had been left in the morn-
ing. Winni had ridden half the night to
find her, taken food and built up her fire.
He had found Coonardoo lying just
where the boys left her,.but with her eyes
open and gazing up amongst the stars. Winni
had crouched beside her, trying to bring her
mind from the dazed misery of her suffer-
ing.
He had ridden back and been in the
camp before dawn. Again and again he had
gone back to Coonardoo
at night; then Chitali
had made him sleep and
taken his place. Hugh
might have guessed what
had happened when lie
saw Winni sleeping on
his stomach at mid-day.
He looked over the
horses and saw that Dio-
nysus was jaded as
though he had been rid-
den hard, ridden all
night!
Vaguely Hugh won-
dered whether Coonar-
doo would be in at the
homestead when he got
t h e r e—w hetli e r she
would be standing on the
verandah in a blue gina-
gina, the dark, silent
figure she had always
been, and expect him to
forget, never to refer
again to that ugly night-
mare of the ranges.
He did not intend that she should stay
there. He would order her off the verandah.
Meenie could sweep and look after the
place. He acknowledged to himself that he
had been harsh and brutal. The more
reason for not having Coonardoo there to
remind him.
He did not doubt, even, if she was not
there when the musterers returned, that
Coonardoo would come back to Wytaliba,
wander in from the bush one day, very
gaunt and hollow-eyed, drift down to the
house or the uloo, and sit down there.
CHAPTER XXXI.
Hugh was droving the mob mustered
after the rains to the railhead himself. The
beasts mooched along feeding, although
they were a wild lot—had rushed two or
three nights running.
Billy Gale, with his boy Arra, rode into
the camp below Nungarra rocks at sunset
one evening. He and Phyllis were living
in the shack of mud bricks, roofed with
corrugated-iron he had put up on Catchy-
Catchy, as Bill still called the country he
held on Wytaliba boundary north and east.
Hugh had seen little of Phyllis since she
was married. She had ridden over once or
twice when Bill was going into Nuniewarra,
which he still worked for Geary. But she
was nearly eighty miles from Wytaliba
homestead, and was kept busy with the
wells they were sinking, the sheds and wind-
mills which were being put up about her
new home.
Hugh pulled in at the homestead for stores.
The boys killed the night they came in.
and Hugh himself saw to cutting up and
salting of the meat. He refilled the tucker-
bags and loaded his packs, gave Meenie
stores for the blacks, and put the keys in
his pocket.
There was a curious, heavy, quietness
about the women from the uloo; even the
men looked sullen and resentful. Bardi had
told her story of that night in the camp,
Hugh knew. And where was Coonardoo?
She had not come in as he expected. She
was not down at the camp. He diH not
want to think about her, to feel she would
not come along the verandah and stand
beside him, knowing what he wished to do
without his having to speak. He would
not remember what had happened. The
same heavy quiet was on him as on the
blacks.
Deeper, more implacable than his anger,
resentment had settled upon him. But he
did not doubt Coonardoo would come in
from the bush one day and five out the
life of her people down there beside the
creek.
No harm would come to her out in the
ranges. Was she not part of the place and
the life? But what a blank her being away-
made in life at the homestead where she
had been! Could you believe it? Could any-
body believe a man, a sane man, would
feel like that about a gin?
Hugh started, sweating from his stretch
on the verandah at midday. Sharply, in-
tolerably, he remembered how he had
pushed Coonai’doo away from him, how
she had fallen into the fire. He h,ad hit
out at the dark, pleading face, the an-
guished eyes. What possessed him? Was
lie mad? ITe could not understand the
fury which had consumed him.^
He was glad to be on the road again;
slept one night at the homestead, took the
packs on and picked up the boys with the
cattle. The bullocks were wild and rest-
less after they left Wytaliba boundaries.
When a night-horse shook his saddle, they
were up like one beast and raced for two
or three miles before they could be turned
back to the road again.
But hard riding and watchfulness were
better to Hugh than time to stand and
think, to lie and try to read, or sleep and
dream. The boys muttered and glanced
sideways at him. There was no doubt in
anybody’s mind that a narlu, some evil
spirit, had jumped into and taken posses-
sion of Youie. He was not the man they
had known. They had been used to a
fellowship, jokey and good-humored; a man
who laughed and sang as he rode round the
cattle with them. Sang his own long, wail-
ing rigmaroles and tried to sing theirs.
This morose and glowering fellow with
his gusts of ungovernable temper was some
one they did not know. The boys were
afraid of him, that he would run amok
again as he had done over Coonardoo.
They watched him from the side of their
eyes as he cooked his own meal over the
fire at night, and sat brooding into the
distance, smoking or reading, and cursing
the mosquitoes and ants.
Hugh slept poorly, waking at night with
startled yells. The blacks could see him
as they went round the cattle at night,
sitting up to put wood on his fire, walking
about, and always he was awake when
Chitali came to him with his horse for the
dawn watch.
When the cattle were restless he went
on with the boys all night, and his eyes
during the day were the bare blue of the
skies. Sometimes as he paced backwards
and forwards on his horse under the stars
the boys heard him singing:
“Towera chinima poodinya
Tower a jinner mulbeena.” .
Coonardoo’s little song that was, and
they wondered to hear Youie singing it
when he was so angry with Coonardoo. He
sang in a thin childish voice, as if it were
Coonardoo singing when she was a little
girl, and the boys exclaimed to each other,
fear in their eyes. They began to think
Coonardoo was dead, 1 and her spirit was
plaguing You for the way he had treated
her. But Winni would follow Youie’s sing-
ing, wailing and muttering. It was as if
they were calling Coonardoo, both of them,
calling and grieving for her, out there, as
they went round the cattle.
More often Winnie was heard intoning
a low, moaning melody with broken rhythm:
“Nungardie naju, karri chitar-aima warra
naju

If, as the poet sings, “Happiness is our being,
our end and aim, with pleasure, ease and
content,” then truly
THE AMBASSADORS.
is the perfect and most potent medium for
its realisation.
“All who joy would win must share it—
happiness was bom a twin.” Twin joys,
without canker or cark, are yours at—
THE AMBASSADORS
where there are creations to delight the most
fastidious palates, soft lights and softest colors
to delight the eye, a compelling orchestra,
and a dance floor on springs of unparalleled
resilience.
“At dinner-time, have in mind where we must
meet.” (“Merchant of Venice.”) Had Shaks-
peare lived in Sydney in this year of grace,
the meeting place would surely have been
THE AMBASSADORS,
where epicurean chefs sharpen with cloyless
sauce the appetite, where good company, good
wine, good orchestra and good welcome cheer
good company.
Pepys, in his famous Diary, has written. “But
that which did please me beyond anything in
the whole world was the wind-music.” And
so say all amateurs of the dance in Sydney
after a Dinner or Supper Dance at
THE AMBASSADORS,
where the Orchestra is as fluent as the sea,
the floor as resilient as a bow that is bent,
and the such and so varied gastronomic tastes
of all are gratified by the supreme skill and
craft of the cuisine.
“Give us the luxuries of life, and we will
dispense with its necessaries,” said a wise
man and a wily. The highest expression of
the luxuries of life is to be found at
THE AMBASSADORS,
where such sweet compulsion rests in the music
of the dance, glory of the kitchen, and the
allure and witchery of the mise en scene.
Here’s a metal more attractive.
The one thing finished in this hasty City.
Sit down. .. .and welcome to our table.
Where is the man who can live without dining?
Like, but oh! how different.
Our dinner is noble and enough.

I stand and wail for you, but 1 will return
and bring something pleasing for you in the
way of food.’”
“Oh, that’s it, is it?” Hugh replied
awkwardly.
The boys had heard him trying to smg
“Nungardie naju” too; but he could never
quite get the wavering air and broken
rhythm of the little old song they all knew
quite well.
In a rush beyond Nuniewarra forty beasts
got away.
“Never mind,” Hugh said. “Leave ’em
grow fat.”
But the mob had run off so much beef
by the time it reached Karrara, he took
£8 a head for the lot, and after a night at
the pub started back for Wytaliba again.
On Wytaliba, when Hugh and the boys
returned, the grass was a foot high, begin-
ning to fade and turn yellow already; the
wax bushes had small faded pink flowers,
the mulga tufts of new leaves. But down
at the uloo old Joey and the women were
having a bad time. Their flour and sugar
had given out, and they had been living
on bardies, bungarra and kangaroo, with
only women and children to hunt for them.
Coonardoo had not come in. The old
women were wailing for her at dawn as
though she were dead. They did not men-
tion her name.
The house stood blank and neglected-
looking. Fowls wandered over the veran-
dahs, roosting and leaving their dirty trails.
Red dust lay deep on everything.
Chitali came to Hugh. Winni was with
him, his eyes savage with misery and
despair.
“Go find Coonardoo,” Chitali said.
“Right.” Hugh filled their tucker-bags.
He saw the boys, Chitali and Winni, ride
out, taking a couple of horses each.
It was a month since they had come in
from the To-morrow without Coonardoo.
Hugh could not look at Chitali and Winni ;
he wanted to go with them. But he would
not, watching them with bitterness and self-
abasement.
“Rotten!” he brooded. “Rotten, that’s
what I am. There goes my son to look
for his mother—and I haven’t the spunk to
go with him. It’s beneath my dignity. My
pride won’t let me. They’re better than I
am. Simpler, more honest and kindly.
Warieda would have banged her about per-
haps; but not scared her to death, pitched
her into the fire. Coonardoo, my poor
Coonardoo, if you’d been a dog I wouldn’t
have treated you like that!.... And I
didn’t even say to them: ‘Bring her back.
See that you bring her back, boys, no
matter where she is, what she’s done.’ ”
There was plenty to do in at the station
during the weeks the boys were away.
Hugh worked up at the shed, tanning and
stretching hides, repairing one of the mills
which was out of order, making up his
books and stewing over accounts.
He had to cook for himself, although
Meenie washed and swept grudgingly with
a bad grace. Nobody forgave him really
for the absence of Coonardoo. After Hugh
had left, taking the cattle down to Kar-
rara, Joey and the women had gone out
to look for Coonardoo. They had walked
to the camp by the head of the creek where.
the boys left her, and found her fire; but
she was not there. They had followed her
tracks along the creek and lost them where
she crossed over. She was ill, and walking
crazily, the tracks showed. Bandogera
wailed for Coonardoo in the morning.
Meenie and she would not mention her
name.
It was a good season, the desert-pea scar-
let under the mulga. For miles it stretched,
flowing, the color of bright arterial blood,
under the grey-green trees and over the
plains, although there were stretches of
country where not a drop of rain seemed
to have fallen. Forests of dead mulga still
stood, shining silverly in hard, dry earth.
Chitali and Winni returned, but Coonar-
doo was not with them. They had searched
and tracked for miles, and could not find
her. At the top of the range Winni had
found the ashes of a small, lonely fire, and
there were bird’s feathers lying about. They
had picked up a track again crossing the
old northern stock-route. Other blacks
they fell in with had neither seen nor heard
of Coonardoo. She had covered her tracks
well.
Chitali was sure, however, she was not
dead; they would find her some day. She
had wandered a Iona way, joined an inland
tribe or gone into the uloo of some station
blacks. At the summer pink-eye he
thought some news would be gleaned of her.
Hugh rode over to Nuniewarra. He took
Winni with him, but would not go into
Geary’s house. Sam came out to meet
him. There was a row: Winni did not hear
what was said. Afterwards Hugh sent him
down to the uloo by Nuniewarra well to
find out whether Coonardoo was there.
But the -Nuniewarra folk had not seen or
heard anything of her. At musters, on all
the stations along his boundary, Hugh in-
quired for Coonardoo. Winni asked every
man he met, white or black, whether she
had been seen or heard of.
Once or twice a rumor of her was caught
and lost again.
A teamster coming down from Roebourne
had seen a tall gin with fairish hair.
“A dirty old swab come in from the bush
to Monty Blood’s place a while back,” he
said. “He’s got a hut back of Weelarra.
The ‘out station,’ they call it. All burnt,
she was. Monty washed her wounds out
with Condy’s for her. Took him two hours
a day. Beastly job. Made you fair sick
to look at ’em. You know Monty, damned
old hard case, one of the hardest doers in
the Nor’-West, but tender-hearted, by
God!
“The gin? Oh, yes, she lived with him
for a bit; then when Monty went off on
a spree into Roebourne she disappeared.
Monty went real sour on it. 'That’s the
worst of abos,’ he said. ‘They'Ve got to go
bush or pink-eye every now and then. You
can’t depend on ’em.’
“But this one he called Esmeralda, she
was a real good girl; could cook and sew.
All the same, there was something queer
about her. She was a bit gone in the upper
storey the way she’d start yelling and
screaming sometimes beside the camp-fire.
You’d think she’d got the jim-jams or some-
thing. She was scared stiff of fire. But
Monty was real fond of her. Queer, isn’t
it, how fond you can get of a gin? He was
cut up all right when she went away.”
Hugh rode over' to Weelarra, taking
Winni with him. He went to Monty Blood’s
hut to ask about the gin who had come in
out of the bush. He thanked Monty for
what he had done for her, having no doubt
who the woman was. But Monty did not
know where she had go,ne, or what had be-
come of her.
CHAPTER XXXII.
Years moved at their slow, even gait;
but although Hugh and the boys searched
north, south, east and west, they found no
trace of Coonardoo.
The bottom had fallen out of the market
•for horses. Mobs of three and four hund-
red roamed the plains and ridges. Hugh
mustered to brand, geld and rough-handle
the best of his young stuff: took what he
needed for running the station, changed and
worked fresh horses; but more and more
as cars and trucks made their way across
the inland tracks, horses were eating their
heads off, galloping in flocks as wild as
birds, and depreciating in value.
Hugh tried shipping drafts of the hardy,
well-boned Pluto and Hera strains to Sing-
apore and the Straits Settlements. He and
the boys took a mob to Port Headland and
shipped them on an old Dutch tub to an
agent who had been inquiring for Austra-
lian horses. The horses brought a good
price, but bucked and bolted, mad with
terror at the sights and sounds of a foreign
country. They gave the breed a bad name.
There was nothing for it, Hugh realised,
but to send a man with the next draft,
to show what handling and horsemanship
could do with fresh and spirited horses. And
Billy Gale was the man for the job. Billy
persuaded Sam Geary that the game was
worth the candle, and he and Phyllis went
with the next shipload of horses from Nunie-
warra and Wytaliba for British India. Hugh
arranged to keep an eye on Catchy-Catchy
while Bill was away, and Sam was pleased
enough to demonstrate that he could man-
age quite well without Bill Gale if he felt
inclined to.
Hugh .shipped two or three drafts of
horses to the Straits and India. Morose
and sullen-eyed, he mooched through
the wide street of northern town-
ships when he came through with horses.
As dirty as the boys he looked, his trousers
patched with the sharks’ teeth of gins’ sew-,
ing, his wide-brimmed hat weathered and
frayed at the edges, the band in shreds.
Men loafing about the whitewashed sheds
and corrugated-iron shacks, stores and pubs
looked after him as he walked, spurs clank-
ing on the road. Hugh Watt, of Wytaliba,
they told each other, and all the flotsam
and jetsam which hangs about country
towns would drift after him to cadge drinks
or a job. Teamsters and drovers who had
been through Wytaliba pulled up to yarn
with Hugh Watt, and Hugh shouted drinks
in bars up and down the town. He drank
a good deal himself; but no amount of
beer or whisky lifted the weight off his dour
sobriety.
Wytaliba was having a tough spin, it was
well known. Hugh was in up to his neck
with the banks. There was even talk of
foreclosure and of the place being sold over
his head.
For one good season there had been years
when Wytaliba registered falls of no more
than an inch or an inch and a half for
twelve months. Again and again Wytaliba
had missed the rains when almost every
other station inland below the twentieth
parallel had got it. Or a storm had broken
too early, and sun and hot winds blasted and
withered up the young grass and herbage
which should have lasted a season.
It was enough to break any man’s heart.
Yet Hugh Watt slogged on: no verandah
manager about him! He worked as few
white men worked, droving night and day
with the boys through a dry season. No-
body understood why he stuck out life on
Wytaliba without another white man or
white woman to speak to and do odd jobs
for him. Cock-eyed Bob and Ben Alsop
were about the only men who pulled into
the homestead. The work of the place was
done by blacks, as it had always been,
although Geary said even they were begin-
ning to be fed-up with Hugh. He worked
them too hard, and was so surly, given to
such outbursts of rage. The gins did much
as they liked with the food and about keep-
ing the place clean. White cockatoos
swirled round the house when it was empty,
roosting in a tree beside the verandah.
Hugh threw them scraps of meat and talked
to the cockies in an uncanny/way, it was said.

OBJECTS OF COMPANY.
The objects are set out at length in the draft Memorandum of Association and include (inter alia )
the following:—
(a) To purchase from the Vendors the whole of the Queensland assets of the Mount Morgan Gold
Mining Company, Ltd. (in Liquidation), as at 30th June, 1928, which include freehold
property at Rockhampton and Mount Morgan, mineral leases, plant and equipment, coal mine
at Baralaba and quarries at Marmor. ...
(b) To dispose of that portion of the plant and equipment which it is decided will not be
required in the future operations of ; this Company.
(c) To recover copper by precipitation process (see attached reports on this process).
(d) To treat a quantity of Tailings, estimated to be 250,000 tons.
(e) To recover all the accessible ore, estimated at 664,000 tons.
(f) To consider the question of working the vast quantity of remaining ore, estimated at
approximately 7,000,000 tons.
THE ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED.
It is provided in the Contract for Sale hereinafter referred to that the Company shall purchase
from the Vendors the whole of the Queensland assets of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company,
Limited (in Liquidation), for the sum of £145,000 payable as to £120,000 in cash and as to £25,000
by the issue of 25,000 shares of £1 each credited as fully paid up. These assets have been carefully
inspected by certain of the Directors and their experts, and the realisable value of the assets and their
nature are reported on as follows, namely: —
1. Plant and Equipment.
The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company’s equipment was considered a most elaborate and up-to-date
plant It stood on the Company’s books on 30th June, 1927 at £638,459.
The New Mount Morgan Company’s estimate of the value of plant and equipment is £169,220, which
figure is substantiated by Mr. L. Hinks’s report.
2. Copper by Precipitation.
The recovery of copper by precipitation in situ is not a new thing. Probably the best example is
that of the Ohio Copper Company of Utah, U.S.A., where the ore body is estimated to contain 38,000,000
tons assaying 88% Cu., while Mount Morgan with its 8,000,000 tons of ore assays 1.72% Cu. Thus
we have in the Utah Company’s mine 334,400 tonsof copper from 38,000,000 tons of ore, while at
Mount Morgan, with its only 8,000,000 tons of ore, we have 134,600 tons of copper.
Mr A A Boyd who has been Manager of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, Ltd. (now
in Liquidation) for’fourteen years, estimates that a net yearly profit of £25,000 with electrolytic copper
at £72 per ton could be secured from this source. Mr. Boyd’s figures have been endorsed by Mr.
W. S. Jensen.
3. Tailings.
The 250,000 tons of tailings is estimated by Mr. W. S. Jensen to yield a net profit of at least
1/- per ton (see report), a total of £12,500.
4. The Accessible Ore.
The quantity is estimated by Messrs. Boyd and Jensen to be 664,000 tons at an average value (at
tn-dav’s metal prices) of 40/- per ton. It is at present difficult to estimate the net profit obtainable
after treatment of this ore, but at the conservative figure of 5/- per ton it would mean a net return
of £166,000.
5. Labor Costs.
In connection with the foregoing channels of operations of the Company, Labor costs do not affect
the position to any marked degree, as a minimum of labor will be necessary to dismantle the plant not
required. palpitation is mainly done mechanically. The treatment of Tailings is also mostly
mechanical, while the quantity of ore referred to, 664,000 tons, is already largely developed, and it is

FOR "LATE NIGHT”
STOMACHS
A late night, with ever so little to drink,
is poison to many. Next morning the head
aches, the tongue is bad, and the stomach
is worse. What to do? Take Para-Pepsin!
Quick as a flash it calms the stomach;
freshens the mouth; sweetens the breath.
Appetite comes; irritability goes. It’s worth
a trial! Once a stomach sufferer tries it he
never goes back to harmful anti-acids. Para-
Pepsin is sold in tablet form, any chemist’s,
at 2/- and 3/6. For a real and quick return
to stomach health you must be sure to get
Para-Pepsin.
If any illustration in The Bulletin takes
your fancy, write to the Manager, who will

STOP
GREYNESS
Six out of eight are bald or grey at 40, yet
very few need be. The hair roots can be
stimulated to new life very quickly by a new
scalp-invigorating preparation known as “Vi-
Glo.” This acts on the growth and color cells
much as rain acts on a parched plant. So
long as the hair roots and color glands are
not dead (and they rarely die), “Vi-Glo” will
show remarkable results, growing now, youth-
ful hair and restoring color to fading hair,
in quick time. Ask your chemist for a 37-
package of “Vi-Glo” to-day, or send 3/4 for

The Lady of The Buffs.
By_ J.H.M ABBOTT.
ON a summer afternoon ninety-seven
years ago, Major Wilfred Thomas
Hinkle sat by an open window in his
quarters, and looked out upon the moving
crowd that thronged the Barrack Square.
The blare and crash of the band echoed back
from the long range of tall buildings that
stood on the crest of the gentle slope upon
the western side of the great rectangle en-
closed by the outer walls, and everywhere
on the grassy sward ci’ossed by gravel paths
that radiated upwards from the gates and
the guardroom moved little groups of men
and women who represented all that was
most select in the society of Sydney in 1825.
Gentlemen of the Civil Establishment, top-
hatted and silk-stocked, strolled about the
well-kept lawns in the company of dainty
ladies dressed in cool muslins and ginghams
with quaint coal-scuttle bonnets that en-
hanced pretty faces and helped to conceal
ugly ones. Stout, elderly merchants escorted
plump and comfortable matrons, and some-
what pompous landowners of the Hawkes-
bury and Nepean districts and those about
George’s River to the southward towed
wives and daughters in their wake. The
scarlet uniforms of officers of the regiment
and a few blue ones from the two warships
lying in Sydney Cove mingled with, and lent
color and brightness to, the assemblage that
eddied about the large circle of perspiring
musicians in red coats and tall shakos blow-
ing into instruments of brass and wood,
rattling upon drums and clashing cymbals
for the entertainment of the guests of the
colonel and officers of his Majesty’s 3rd Regi-
ment of Foot —the famous Buffs. In door-
ways and in windows of the main buildings
soldiers lounged in shirtsleeves, smoking clay
pipes, as they commented, with all the terse
and witty directness of Thomas Atkins, upon
the “Quality” that filled the parade ground
and went in and out of the officers’ mess in
twos and threes.
Major Hinkle was in full dress, and his
shako and gloves lay upon his writing-table,
where he had placed them when he came
in a few minutes before. Presently he rose
to his feet and began to pace up and down
the large room between door and window.
A fine-looking man—tall and spare and
active, with a clean-shaven face that was
clear-cut and strong, and had indications
of reserve in it. His dark hair was turning
to grey a little at the temples—most veterans
of the Peninsular and Waterloo were begin-
ning to show some signs of age by this time
—but in no other respect did he illustrate
his forty years.
There came a knock at the door.
“Come in!” called the Major, turning
expectantly as he came near the window.
He faced the opening door with his back
to the light.
A young officer entered the room, fair,
boyish and flaxen-haired.
“Ah, Jordan!” The Major greeted him
quietly.
“You sent for me, sir?”
“Yes. Pray find a chair. I have some-
thing to say to you.”
He seated himself with his back to the
light, his well-shaped head clear cut against
the glare without. The younger man re-
moved his shako, and sat down opposite to
him, resting the grotesque military head-
dress upon liis knees. Ilis blue eyes regarded
the Second-in-Cjmmand questioningly, and
with a little anxiety. After a short pause
the Major spoke.
“Well, Jordan, my boy, I have heard all
about it.”
Ensign Jordan blushed, looking, except for
his martial habiliments, extraordinarily like
a pretty girl. Major Hinkle smiled a little
as lie watched him.
“D’ye know, after a fashion I cannot help
approving of what you have done. But” —
and he paused as if to emphasise his words
—“it cannot be permitted. You understand?
You must not meet Mr. Montgomery. It
is out of the question.”
The young officer stood up. “But, sir,
my honor”
The Major motioned him with his hand
to be seated again, and with an air of pro-
test he grudgingly obeyed.
“Sit down, Jordan. I want to discuss
this business with you. I have only just
heard of it. In the mess. Charles Mont-
gomery told me of it himself. He said that
be had no option but to challenge you. No
option. Your attitude was such that it left
him no choice. Pray, now, what icas your
attitude?”
“Well, sir, since you insist. I had occa-
sion to —that is, I slapped his face.” He
was very red now, and more feminine than
ever.
“The devil you did !”
“I could do nothing else, sir.”
“Well, but why? There may have been,
alternatives. ’Tis a rather serious thing
to slap the face of the Governor’s aide-de-
camp, you know. Especially in New South
Wales. Fortunately, Sir Thomas Brisbane
is easy-going—so long as no one comes be-
tween him and the stars. From what I’ve
heard of Governor Macquarie I'm inclined
to think that you’d have been sent home
and cashiered had you taken such a liberty
with any of his personal staff. What made
you do such a thing?”
The boy hesitated, obviously embarrassed,
and fidgeted with his shako.
“Come, ‘My Lady’ ’’—the Major spoke
kindly and encouragingly—“you may as well
“‘Sir, will you accept my sincere apology for my familiarity this afternoon.'"
toll me. I am asking in quite a friendly
spirit.”
Ensign Jordan stiffened, and his pink-and-
white face lost something of its girlishness.
His reply had resentment in it.
“I struck him, sir, because—l struck him
for saying what you’ve just said.”
“What—for indicating that he spoke in
a friendly spirit?”
“No, sir. For his d—d impertinence in
addressing me as ’My Lady.’ ”
Major Hinkle covered his mouth with his
hand. but his eyes twinkled.
“Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Jordan. I
didn’t mean to he offensive.”
The boy raised his hand in protest. Oh,
indeed, you’re not, sir. ’Tis my nickname
in the mess. ’Tis not —not a bit offensive
from one of Ours, sir. Only well, I can t
very easily endure it from an outsider, sup-
posing, sir,” he said deferentially, he had
called you ‘Ramrod’? That is your title in
the regiment, you know, sir.”
The Major laughed. “Oh, yes, of course.
I know- what they call me. And perhaps I
might feel a little annoyed if anyone outs.d ■
ourselves were to address me by my title.
But surely, Mr. Jordan, from a fellow-soldier,
you know—Mr. Montgomery is a lieutenant
in the Sappers—it was not so bad. Now,
was it?”
“ ’Twas his manner of saying it, sir. ’Twas
what he said with it.”
“Well, but what did he say? How did
it come about?”
“He took me by the arm, sir, and then—
damn him ! —he put his arm. about me, and
—and was most obnoxious, sir.”
“Yes, yes. But what were his words?’
“Several of us were having a drink, sir,
when Mr. Montgomery turned to me, and did
as I have told you. lie said, ‘Damme, how
pretty My Lady looks to-day. But, I declare,
she is without her corsets.’ Unendurable,
sir!”
“Oh, well, yes. Cheeky, I’ll admit.’ _
“Insufferable, sir,” said Mr. Jordan, indig-
nantly.
"And then you slapped his face?
“Yes, sir— hard. And told him I was no
poodle-dog, at any rate.”
Major Hinkle smiled, but said nothing
for a little while. He seemed to be con-
sidering the grave affair. Presently he stood
up. “You have not yet received his chal-
lenge?”
“No, sir.”
“Good! Well, listen to me.”
“Yes, sir.”
“I am proceeding to Parramatta at once,
There has been some Slight trouble with the
detachment there. Over the canteen. The
Colonel wishes me to go and inquire into
it. And I want you to come with me. You
will please give instructions to my groom,
Hartley, to have the bay mare harnessed m
the gig immediately. We will start in half an
hour or so. Make your preparations—and
don’t go into the mess,. Let me see”—he
looked at his watch---” ’tis four o’clock. AY e
will leave at half-past the hour. D’ye un-
derstand, Jordan? I don’t want you to go
into the mess, and be ready to leave here
with me in half an hour.”
Tlie boy protested. “But, sir—’twill
look as though I am running away. Could
not another subaltern go with you, sir?”
“Nonsense! You have received your
orders, and are going away on duty. Duty
comes before private affairs. So be off with
you, and get ready. And don’t go near the
mess'.”
Ensign Jordan put on his shako, stood
to attention, and saluted stiffly.
“Very good, sir'. Since it is an order, I
have no choice.”
“No, you have none,” replied Major
Hinkle. “Kindly pull the bell-cord as you
go out. I want my servant.”
With sorrowful dignity Mr. Jordan, salut-
ing once more, turned about and departed—•
tugging at the bell-cord by the door as he
left the room.
* * * *
Major Hinkle and Ensign Jordan dined at
the half-way house at Homebush, and it wq,s
quite dark when the Major’s gig was brought
round from the stables, and they prepared
to resume their drive to Parramatta.
As they took their seats in the high cur-
ricle, old Tom Dinwiddie, the landlord of
the inn, obtruded his fat face into the glare
of the lamps. His usually smiling visage
had a serious look in it.
“I’ve but just had wo.r-rd, Mejor,” he
said anxiously, “that Paddy the' Goat’s a-
carryin’ on up th’ road beyont. He’s stuck up
a party this arternoon, nigh to tlr Clay
Creek bridge. Wouldn’t it be as well, y’r
honor, if ye was to wait till marnin’? YVid
tliim lights an’ all y’r like to be tuk
unawares, if that blagyard an’ his mob’s
a-bailin’ up trav’lers in th’ dark. He’s a
rale bad ’un, is that same Paddy*. I’ve
rooms for both y‘r honors if ye’d care to
wait till to-morrow.”
The Major laughed with good-humored
contempt. “Paddy the Goat? That’s that
fellow Cassidy, isn’t it?”
“ ’Tis that same, sorr. A desprit fellie he
is—wid a great grudge agin sojers, him
havin’ bin in th’ army hisself.”
“In the army! Not in the Buffs, was he?”
“No, sorr. In th’ 46th, whin Colonel
Molle was here. Desarted an’ was took in
a month, lie got two hundred lashes, an’
seven years on th’ roads 1 . Eighteen months
ago he bolted from tlie gang at th’ Stonequarry
an's bin ragin’ roun’ the coontry ’twixt
Liverpool an’ Emu Ford iver since. ’Tis
said he hides somewheres beyont Mulgoa, at
th’ foot o’ th’ Mountains. A rale divil, y’r
honor, a proper bitter divil —would think
no more o’ puttin’ a bullet into ayther o’
y’r honors than he wud o’ takin’ his tay.
Will ye not be for stoppin’ overnight?
’Twould be safest, Mejor dear.”
“Nonsense, Tom. You don’t think Mr.
Jordan or I would be afraid of such a raps-
callion? What do you say, Jordan —shall
we stay here? I don’t think the fellow’s
worth it myself. What d’ye think?”
“Oh no, sir,” hastily replied the lad by
his side? “Of course not. We have our
pistols. ’Twould never do for officers in
his Majesty’s service to give the highway to
such rascals. If they should stick us up,
I’m sure we could give a good account -of
ourselves —possibly make them prisoners. I’m
for going on, sir.”
“Quite so. Hear, hear. Stand away from
the mare’s head, will you, Dinwiddie —if you
please. ’Tis growing late, and a good seven
miles to Parramatta.”
“A moment, sorr,” the landlord said
hastily. “I’ve a fine new blunderbuss —loaded
to th’ muzzle wi’ buckshot. ’Tis a fine
weapon at close quarters, y’r honor’. But
just let me put it in th’ gig. Ye’ll mebbe
find it handy, an’ ye can lave it here on
y’r way back'to town. I’ll go get it, sorr.
Just a moment, y’r honor.”
“Oh, very well, Tom. If you insist. But
I don’t suppose we’ll see a sign of the vil-
lains. However, Mr. Jordan can hold it, and
imagine himself back in England, acting as
a Boyal Mail guard on the Dover Road, eh?
Thank you, Tom. We’ll be all right.”
Mr. Dinwiddie hastened into the lighted
house. Major Hinkle laughed when he/ be-
held the fearsome bell-mouthed firearm
which the landlord presently handed up to
Ensign Jordan. “By George, that ought to
settle any bushranger’s hash, Tom! Now
then, we’ll get along*. Good night to ye,
Dinwiddie. Tclik! old girl.” He flicked the
mare with the whip and they were away into
the darkness.
But Mr. Dinwiddie’s warning was not
without justification. For three miles the
splendid animal between the shafts drew
them rapidly along the surface of the fine
turnpike which Macquarie had made in place
of the rough cart track that had formerly
existed between Sydney and the Hawkesbury.
“A fast trotter, Jordan, eh!” the Major
had just remarked with pride as they were
tearing along a lonely stretch of the road
between two walls of tall timber that showed
dimly against the stars on either hand, when,

without any warning, the mare tripped over
some obstacle and fell with a crash and a
rattle of harness in the roadway. The Major
took a header over the dashboard, but Ensign
Jordan was more fortunate. He had been
holding the rail with his left hand, which
involuntarily tightened its grip when the
smash came, whilst, with his right, he
steadied the heavy blunderbuss between his
knees. A chorus of savage yells from the
darkness on either hand split the air as the
mare came down and lay stunned in the
roadway.
"Til’ rope, th’ rope s fetched em!

Men came running into the lamplight—
rough-looking fellows with hany face*. n.

conscious For a moment Ensign Jordan
was paralysed. Then a pistol shot made a
blaze of light in front of him, and the heavy
ball whistled past his right ear. This brought
him in

roar like a cannon the blunderbuss belched
flame and buckshot and destruction into
them. Mr. Jordan experienced such a kick
from the recoil that his right shoulder seemed
to be dislocated, and he was literally toppled
over the side of the curricle and fell to the
roadway. As he lay for a moment there he
heard an agonised voice shrieking:
~ , , ~ ,

He staggered to his feet drawing a pistol
from his belt with his left hand, and taking
a snapshot at a dark figure that came run-

Another pistol shot split the darkness, and

form he realised that the bushrangers were
scudding away. From thirty yards ahead in
the black darkness came the flash of a part-
ing shot, which smashed the offside lamp.
Almost immediately Mr. Jordan became
aware of galloping hoof-beats from behind
as four horsemen rode up from the direction
of Homebush. As Mr. Jordan reached the
Major and stooped over him they came
crowding about the scene of conflict, which
was also a scene of almost incredible car
nage.
“O my God, my eyes !” someone kept up
a perpetual sob in the darkness of the road-
side.
“What is it?” a voice asked quietly, its
owner peering down from the back of a big
black horse at Mr. Jordan and the Major,

Fighters All.
Now that the Barrier is gay
With everlasting-flowers.
Whose yellow sheen
Amid the green
Of herbage lights the hours,
I’d like to ride its quartz-strewn tracks,
Carefree, youth mine again;
Beside me saltbush wet with dew;
Beside me bygone men.
Big-hearted men, brave-hearted men!
Nothing could stay or stem
Their will to fight—
To them to-night
I lift my hat—to them!
Stern fighters all, grim wrestlers all,
They matched their strength with drought—
’Twas Death, ’twas Death alone, at length,
That met and sent them out.
The gold of everlasting-flowers
With smiling Spring departs,
Grows dull and pales,
But never fails
The gold of valiant hearts:
More precious than the gold of flowers,
Or that which end-of-day
And set-of-sun strews o’er the skies,
It shines undulled for aye!
Now that the Barrier is bright
With everlasting-flowers
On all its ways,
Thanks, thanks I raise
That such as they were ours!
Trackmakers, builders, hewers all.
Who gave their manhood’s best
Through years, stern years and arid years,
To tame the glaring West.

Summer Song to Love.
Time lias uo terror here,
Life has no wrong;
Only twin ecstasies —
Summer and song!
I too would be singing
The song I love best,
But the melody falters
And dies unexpressed.
O Lady, your laughter
Far down by the sea
Comes blown on the spindrift
And tarries with me.
The breezes are singing,
The birds and the bees.
And the sunlight is music
That haunts the hushed trees.
The whispering bracken
Has voices that call,
And the seas swinging shoreward
Are troubadours all.
Life's self has turned music
That chants to the blue
A many-voiced rapture
For you and for you !
Yet of all their brave singing
One song still is best:
T love you, I love you—
What matters the rest?
QUEENSLAND
J. HOLLWAY.
Siren.
From a hairy Aino’s mouth,
By the shore of Yezo flung
On a sea-wind screaming south.
To his whale-gut banjo sung;
From a waiting lover’s lip
O’er a shadowed, still lagoon,
Where impatient paddles dip
To a tender water-moon,
I shall voice my long desire,
1 shall call them unto me;
I who woo in calm or ire,
All who seek me —I, the Sea!
From my tepid, primal wave,
Over sound of claw and wing,
Loud the tribesman in his cave
Heard my wild witch-music ring;
And from pipes of reed he drew
Fancies crude and harsh in tone;
But the sullen songs he blew
Were but echoes of mine own.
Blood and sweat of long ago
On the westing ways of trade
Funic rowers, bending low,
O’er each heavy, dripping blade,
Lest I work their voyage w 7 oe
Humble invocation made.
Young Hellenes, lithe and brown,
Greeks and poets, lovers all!
Sailing summer seas adown,
flow their naked numbers call,
Still my magic and renown,
I who held their hearts in thrall.
I who gave their souls to song,
I their sea-born Venus, I
Who reared my happy shrines along
Their shores in dreaming days gone
by—
I hold ye to my bosom strong,
My singing sons: ye shall not die!
From their seven hills they tramped,
Clanging to the Tiber-side ;
And anon their legions camped
Scornful by the Jordan’s tide.
Or by the dark Thames dimly lamped
Their conquests and their pride,
Swarthy cohorts, grimly sped.
Loved me never deep nor long;
But my Norse- and Ersemen red,
As their war-boats swept along,
Voiced my olden charm and dread
In undying saga-song.
These, my lovers, fierce and rude.
From their creeks and fiords bore
Echoes of my Norland mood,
The eternal waters o’er;
I shall hold them and their brood,
Favored sons for evermore.
Care I not how rude and free,
Care 1 not how soft and fine;
I shall call ye unto me
With a magic, lovers mine.
Of a song that e’er shall he
Siceet. as honey, strong as trine.
By my siren voice a-tune,
Sweet as honey, salt as brine,
As the spring tides and the moon
hi a mystic wed Joel: shine;
By a seaward written rune
Ye are mine, aye, ye are mine!

That backache again!
Why not get at the cause?
MORE than likely your kidneys are to blame. Backache, head-
aches, dizziness, urinary disorders, sciatica, rheumatism,
lumbago, dropsical swellings, gravel and dropsy may all be caused
by harmful impurities which weak or sluggish kidneys have failed
to take out from the blood. Be quick to correct this! Don’t allow
the kidney weakness to go from bad to worse! You run too grave
a risk! Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, without any further
delay; they will not fail. Grateful people, everywhere, recommend
this special kidney medicine for relieving and preventing kidney
disorder and its many symptoms.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY
GIVEN HERE.
Mr. A. B. Cowell, “Halyeon,” Park Road, Mascot, Sydney, says:
“Some months ago I was suddenly seized with a terrible pain across
my back, just above the kidneys. It did not go away as I thought at
first it would, but on the contrary it. got worse, and I was soon so
bad that I was bent almost double. I ; was completely crippled, and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain. I could not
turn over without suffering acutely; in fact, no position was comfortable
for long. My secretions were affected, being thick and cloudy, with a
red sediment.’ I tried different remedies, but they gave me no relief
whatever. One day a friend suggested I should take Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and it proved to be good advice, too, for three bottles
cured me completely. I feel splendid now, and my recovery is due
solelv to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Eight years later Mrs. Cowell says : “My son is still well, Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all signs of kidney
trouble.”

PILES AND ECZEMA CURED
BY DOAN’S OINTMENT
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Eczema Cured.
Mr. H. Watson, sen., Bay Street,
Glebe, Sydney, says: “A couple of
years ago I bad Eczema break out
badly on my chest. It was very
severe and spread rapidly until I was
in such a state that the pain and
irritation nearly drove me mad. A
man I know advised me to get Doan’s
Ointment, saying that he had heard
of excellent results from the use of
this preparation. I thought it a
good idea, and obtained a pot. The
first few applications gave me relief,
and after that I got along splendidly.
Every time I applied the Ointment
there was a marked improvement,
and within a month I was cured, and
not one trace of the ailment remained.
Doan’s Ointment is a splendid pre-
paration for Eczema, and I recom-
mend it with every confidence to
other sufferers. Its soothing and
healing properties are wonderful.”
Piles Cured.
Mrs. M. Brown, Toronto, Lyons
Road, Five Dock, Sydney, says:
“Three years ago I used Doan’s
Ointment for a bad attack of piles,
and I am pleased to tell you it com-
pletely cured me. Previous to trying
this Ointment I used all kinds of
remedies, but they gave me little or
no relief. I was suffering terribly
when I first applied Doan’s Oint-
ment, and had little hope of it doing
me any good, but its soothing and
healing effects were noticeable almost
at once, and by the time I had used
one pot I was cured, all sign of Piles
having completely disappeared. I am
a great believer in Doan’s Ointment,
and consider it the best Pile remedy
known. It cured me after other
remedies had failed?”
Six years later Mrs. Brown says:
“I have had no return of my old
complaint since Doan’s Ointment
cured me about nine years ago.”

KEEP A TIN ALWAYS ON HAND
throat to an ecstasy of indulgence. At such
times he was without conscience. Ann
Martin and Jasper might starve for all he
cared to know —must have so starved but
for a careful and secret contrivance on
Ann’s part in more propitious season.
One of Jasper’s most startling recollections
in after years was of his aunt’s china-white
face as she turned to meet his unexpected
entry of her bedroom. Her hands clutched
a leather handbag, fringed with red glass
beads, that he had surprised her in the act
of taking from beneath a loose board under
the bed. She was terrified, shaking from
head to feet. When she realised that her
hoard was safe, that instead of her husband’s
angrily incredulous eyes she was confronted
by the innocent curiosity of a child, her
own eyes had seemed to spill themselves
into a white flame. She had fallen on her
knees, dragging Jasper to her bosom, bruis-
ing him in a tempest of grateful caresses.
Jasper was then six years old. He came
to Musk Ridge at the age of five days,
orphaned and sickly. On the day of his
birth his father, a clerk in a Melbourne hay
arid corn store, was killed in a street acci-
dent. The same gate that opened life to
Jasper swung shut on his mother’s, so nearly
simultaneously that their two souls might
have met in the passing. Husband and
wife went into the unknown, and a red-
faced, screaming brat journeyed to Gipps-
land in the starved, adoring arms of his
young mother’s sister, Ann Martin.
Those were the better days, while the
grain of his uncle’s soul still made showing
against the husk. Musk Ridge had been
barely selected; the air was one long in-
cense of burning woods; the bracken was
concealed against understanding of its evil.
The little savings of his father came in
handily in the making of Jasper’s new home.
All day Jong Hector Martin’s axe rang its
conquesting song. He came to his home
each night as a victor comes to the applause
of crowds; rather brutally certain of him-
self, of what he had done and meant to do.
He scarcely noticed the puling Jasper. Per-
haps if his own blood had run in the child
he might have been more humanly con-
cerned for this new-found responsibility.
And the bracken had come; first to the
selection; then, with infinite stealth, to
Hector Martin himself. One evil sought
compact with another evil. The soil of
earth found its analogy in the soil of flesh,
and the twain begat the beginnings of ruin.
Instead of going forward, Musk Ridge went
back. Payments fell behind, while the
struggling grassland slowly reverted and
the trees suckered. The night the bush-fire
came to Musk Ridge Hector Martin was
drunk, else he could have saved his tiny
paddock of stookcd oat-hay by burning it
round in a break. His house was saved by
neighbors. There was nothing left for him
to do but, get drunk again; and this he
did. In the meantime the child thrived.
He was christened Jasper, after his
mother’s father. Jasper John Leith. He
thought the name ugly, yet took a certain
youthful pride in contrasting it with the
Bills and Jims and Teds of his growing
acquaintance. Later, in his late teens, from
the soft lios of girls he was to find in it a
quality of color and rhythm vastly satis-
factory.
Jasper’s present thought was interrupted
by the discovery that his uncle had given
up all pretence of work, and was smoking
sullenly at the end of the shed. By Jasper’s
swift reckoning three cows remained yet to
be milked. But here, again, the boy ex-
perienced no fundamental emotion. His
uncle’s habits of work were as irrational
as his methods of living. They were simply
to be accepted. Hector Martin had milked
half a dozen of the easiest cows, and had
then lapsed into complete indifference.
Yet, as Jasper was aware, those warped
occasions knew an invariable after-procedure.
Presently his uncle would rise abruptly
from his seat and turn the herd out of the
yards. He would then harness the brown
mare to the milk sledge, whilst Jasper went
|to the house for a hurried breakfast. This
might be said definitely to close Hector
Martin’s concessions for the time being,
for in the closing stages of his aberration
he dissociated himself entirely from the
processes of the farm. These devolved upon
Jasper, with such aid as his aunt gave him.
Day was breaking through the green girdle
of the trees, with a fine mist spiralling from
the depths of the gully and a white blanket
of frost slowly emerging out of the shadows
on the flat. Soon there would come a
tiny wind around the shoulder of the hill,
and the air would seem to stiffen in the
first clutches of the thaw. A beam of sun-
shine would flash an exquisite iridescence
from the myriad facets of the frost, joining
them to the semblance of a great crystal-
and -diamond cobweb spun for earth’s
counterpane.
Jasper sensed small beauty in a world
so bleak. He hated the cold. The brutality
of it made his mind and body cower.
Always he yearned for the heat of summer:
that heavenly ichor which poured rioting
gold into his veins, spread a magic carpet
at his feet, and drenched his sight with
color and his hearing with melody. There
were wistful recesses of Jasper’s being
wherein the thought of summer glowed like
an altar fire, tending his innate love of the
clean and kind and comfortable. As the
boy grew up he found this flame so waning
that it came hardly to his recognition. At
times, even, it seemed to have died down
altogether. Already there was growing in
him an obsession to escape from a world
typified by Musk Ridge. To get on in life ;
to find wealth and pride and place, at
whatever cost!
His breakfast was set close to the heat
of the oven. He was presently gulping
watery, half-cooked oatmeal, succeeded by
a plate of corned beef, soda-bread and but-
ter, and a pannikin of tea. His hunger was
enormous and uncritical. On the table at
his elbow was his lunch. Jasper knew
exactly what he would find in it. There
would be thick beef sandwiches, a slab of
his aunt’s lard and currant cake, and two
apples. The apples were Winter Magetins,
stored from the trees at the back of the
sheds.
Whenever Jasper set his teeth in
one of these he was reminded of what
Mr. Hume had said when a boy had sneered
at his apple: “Don’t you mind him, Jasper.
It tastes nice, doesn’t it?”
There would follow for Jasper a vision
of Mr. Hume riding away from the school,
with his head sunk into his shoulders and his
toes turned extraordinarily inwards. Mr
Hume’s horsemanship was a standing joke
in Guruwa. His seat in the saddle was
preposterously awkward, and the least mis-
hap brought him to grief. In spite of this
he managed somehow to get over the rough
—at times almost impassable—roads in the
district.
But if he failed as a horseman Mr. Hume
succeeded indisputably as a man. He
had firm hold upon the respect and liking
of the settlers. Added to this, he was
fortunately possessed of a wife as cleverly
demanding of goodfellowship as he was
himself. They were, to their outspoken
regret, without children. There was ample
evidence that the loss sustained by these
good people was Guruwa’s gain, for while
Hume excelled in the role of foster-father
to the adults, Mrs. Hume indefatigably
mothered the small fry.
As Jasper rose from his breakfast, his
aunt said timidly: “I asked Mr. Sloan to
leave • half a bag of flour at the factory.
I expect he won’t, though. There’s his last
month’s bill owing. But you could ask.”
Jasper suggested: “Maybe we could bor-
row some from the Harrises. I could ask
Cora or Tod.”
“No. I expect I’ll manage.”
She followed him to the door, resting a
hand on his shoulder while she bent to kiss
him. The hand was broad and coarsened
with work, with dirt ingrained upon its
palm and thickened flesh growing at the
root of each fingernail. She stared at it
with knit brows as she said: “I always
have managed somehow.”
As though to a common impulse their eyes
met and held for an instant of supreme
commiseration, then turned aside to meet
the silent, sinister figure of Hector Martin
as he came slowly over the brow of the hill.
Jasper heard his aunt catch her breath,
and his cheeks suddenly reddened. He
stammered abruptly: “Aunt, if uncle....
hits you like he done last time... .don’t
you let him do it ....don’t you! I could
tell Mr. Hume, or or someone.”
“Hush, Jasper!” she said in a flat voice.
“You don’t understand. Run along, dear,
or you’ll be late.”
“It’s that that’s making me hate him,"
he said.
He gave her a queer look as he turned
away.
(To be continued.)
The Funeral.
To shroud me if you come, remember, dearest,
My heart was as a bird that breathed and
sung,
My heart that to your heart was ever nearest
Love-airs among.
I shall have then put by the breath and being
Of all things here ; I shall not hear you
come.
My eyes, too, will have lost the power of
seeing,
My lips be dumb.
Yet then, when I am past the tears and
laughter,
As in my shroud you coil and coffin me,
Kemember I was one who dreamed hereafter
Somewhere to be.
I who had passed, even as a bird that tarries
Awhile within a tree, and sings, and goes
Into the night then with the songs it carries
Where no one knows.

Waking.
The wind that blows the morning in
About my curtain lightly plays,
And then, determining to win
My wakened thought, it softly lays
Its fingers on my cheeks; and so
I stir to know a tricksy sprite
Has crept upon me to bestow
New gifts of fragrance and delight.
The world was weary when I laid
My hand upon the hand of sleep ;
Now. in the garb of youth arrayed,
’Tis all young joy, alert, a-leap !
And rising from the opal sea
Morn’s silken sails are pink and gold ;
And fragrant breezes waft to me
Promise of cargoes in the hold.
Last night, but yesternight, I dreamed
That life grew weary of its years;
Faded the lovely roses seemed
Beneath the dews that fell as tears;
But now I know that even death—
That longer sleep we dread to win—
Is kind, and after it the breath
Of morn will blow T new pleasures in.
