Stateliest of England’s
Stately Homes,
Chatsworth House
£HATSWORTH HOUSE stands superb
V/ and lovely in its vast park near
Bakewell in Derbyshire. This great
Palladian mansion, belonging to the
Duke of Devonshire, is known as the
Palace of the Peak. It stands upon the
site of the original Elizabethan Chats-
worth built in 1553 by Sir William
Cavendish and his famous wife, Bess of
Hardwick, who was the guardian of the
unhappy Mary Queen of Scots when she
was held captive there between the years
1570 and 1581. Her name is com-
memorated in “Queen Mary’s Bower,”
which she used to frequent; it stands
beside a graceful stone bridge oyer the
River Derwent, which flows through the
park.
In 1687 Chatsworth was rebuilt in the
lonic style by the first Duke of Devon-
shire and completed twenty years later,
a year before he died. The addition of
another wing ahd a new entrance in 1818
by the sixth Duke increased the magnifi-
cence of Chatsworth, which was visited in
1832 by Princess Victoria when a girl of
thirteen. She was greatly impressed by
the building and by its stately gardens,
which, even today, are unsurpassed in
England. Fountains, cascades, ponds and
broad walks lined with statues recall the
gardens of Versailles.
The main building is rectangular in
shape, three stories high and is built of
local amber-coloured stone. The Grand
Conservatory with its 70,000 square feet
of glass was removed in 1920. It was
built by Sir Joseph Paxton, who later
became famous as the designer of the
Crystal Palace, which housed the Great
Exhibition of 1851.
Palatial rooms within the building in-
clude the State Drawing Room, the State
Music Room and the State Bedroom,
which contains the bed in which George
II died in 1760. Among the many
pictures in the famous Devonshire
Collection are those by Holbein, Titian,
Leonardo da Vinci, Van Dyck and
Reynolds. The Library contains a
number of priceless manuscripts and
35,000 books of the greatest variety and
of considerable value.

NEW POWYS NOVEL.
Set in Wales in the fifth century a.d.
when the Romans have just gone out and
the Saxons are just coming in, John
Cowper Powys’s new novel Porius (Mac-
Donald) does nothing to remove one’s
suspicion that Mr. Powys is one of the
few contemporary novelists destined for
immortality.
True, it is an exceedingly difficult
novel. Opening even his masterpiece A
Glastonbury Romance with a blast of
mystical volubility that must have sent
many a reader reeling dizzily away, Mr.
Powys has never been an easy writer ;
and when in Owen Glendower he moved
away from contemporary rustic England
into the mists of history and Wales he
very nearly moved beyond ordinary
mortal approach.
One reason for the difficulty of Porius
is simply that it bristles with unpro-
nounceable Welsh names. Even such old
acquaintances as Merlin, King Arthur
and the sword Excalibur —no doubt to get
an effect of freshness and to escape from
their Tennysonian connotations —appear
as Myrddin Wyllt, Amherawdr and
Caledvwlch; and the names, as in
Russian novels, keep changing their
form, so that Merlin, though mostly
Myrddin Wyllt, is also Myrddin ap
Morfryn and Myrddin Emrys. Our dear
old friends the Piets are the Gwyddyl-
Ffichti; JuliUs Caesar is Iwl Kessar ; and
really one wonders how Llew ap Greidawl
Derwydd and Kymeinvoll Gwyddles and
the Derwydd of Ynys Prydein ever
managed to pronounce their own names
or to remember, themselves, who they
were.
And if readers who have learned to
find out who is who in Dostoevsky and
have stumbled valiantly into the wilder-
ness of Finnegans Wake should not be
deterred by a confusion of this sort, there
are further difficulties: the lack of swift
movement in the novel, which, rather like
War and Peace and also like The
Glastonbury Romance but without the
dramatic impetus of either, heaves itself
along like a giant caterpillar, like a vast
historical pageant, like an army on the
march, with people continually slipping
away from the main stream to worship
Mithras in a cave or to be seduced by
some aboriginal Welsh giantess on a
mountainside; the tendency of all the
people, at moments of tension and
excitement, to go into a trance, even to
fall asleep, so that Mr. Powys may
analyse their—or his own—private
mysticisms ; the doubts that must arise
as to the historical validity of all these
extraordinary saints and wizards and
hobgoblins; the overriding impression
that characters in a historical novel do
not become more real but less real under
the searching and meticulous psycho-
analysis to which Mr. Powys subjects
them.
But then Mr. Powys never has been
primarily a novelist, as the term is
usually understood today, meaning a
realistic painter of ordinary life. He
lives, and will live, chiefly for his nature-
writing, which is neither the usual
novelist’s pleasant description of scenery
nor the naturalist’s pleasant record of
odd facts but a wild plunging after the
tremendous mysteries behind the scenery
and the oddities. There is no other writer
in English, not even Wordsworth or
D. H. Lawrence, who can so powerfully
convey the feeling of some supernatural
force working through nature; and
Porius —the scenes, though so remote in
time, are drawn freshly from around
Cor wen, where Mr. Powys lives—is as
magically alive in this way as anything
Mr. Powys has ever written:
Instead of crossing this little stream as
Yssylt and the silentiary did, with a mind
too absorbed to catch the sound of its
dallying with its alternately sun-bright and
fern-shadowed pebbles, Morfydd paused
and turned and stared down in fascinated
wonder while a particular sequence of tiny
bubbles met and lost themselves m a larger
one till it came to resemble a subhuman
and at the same time a superhuman eye!
It became in effect the living eye of the
whole chemical substratum of planetary
elements, out of which water, earth and air
draw the fluidity, the solidity, the imponder-
able vacuity of their essential beings. The
girl bent down as they crossed this little
stream, and stared steadily into one of
these constantly-growing bubbles; and this
arbitrarily chosen eye of the whole
inorganic world stared back at her— the
eye of matter itself responding in sub-
conscious or perhaps superconscious indif-
ference to the eye in a human skull!
In a sense all Mr. Powys’s novels,
Porius included, are no more than this:
the eye of a great natural metaphysician
meeting “the eye of matter itself.” But
men and women are also “matter,” and
“matter” in its most variable, most un-
predictable and —except perhaps for
volcanoes— its most violently excitable
condition. So you have a metaphysician
of nature inevitably led to consider
human nature, and so to express himself
in the medium of the novel.
It is no use asking from such a writer
the characterisation “in the round” which
is the usual business of the novelist. Just
as he is not so much interested in the
facts of nature which engage the
naturalist’s attention as in the mystery
behind the facts, so it is the human spirit
in the abstract rather than the everyday
life of the individual that he is chiefly
concerned with; the volcanic 'element;
the extremes of the human spirit when in
oddity or violence it merges with the
daemonic content of the universe which
he sees and feels everywhere lurking
behind the commonplace surface of
things.
Thus the novel is not a history where
you have to worry about whether or not
such people as the indolent and mystical
Porius, descendant of the Romans,
actually lived in the Welsh mountains in
the fifth century (though at least Mr.
Powys must be right in reminding us that
the civilising power and influence of the
Romans did not instantly disappear when
the legions withdrew and the Dark Ages
began); it is not a novel of character in
which you have to worry whether such
wild creatures as the ferocious and
amorous Llew of the forest ever existed
anywhere: it is a gigantic dramatisation
—a fantasy, an allegory—of the forces
of nature and the’ forces of human nature
where they meet in the supernatural.
Easier at least in style than most of
Mr. Powys’s recent writing, less tangled
in italics and exclamation marks, more
approachable because of its very re-
moteness than Owen Glendower, which
was set too much in the realm of re-
corded history for Mr. Powys’s fantasy
to have complete freedom, this is as
strange, as profoundly weird a book as
you could ever hope to read: Merlin,
ragged and hairy, calling his familiar
animals to attend him ; the love-scenes
in the cave of the bald Druid; the
aboriginal giant who catches Porius with
his daughter, chases him with a tree-
trunk and is drowned with the girl in a
lake; the dead bodies wearing each
other’s heads ; the description of the bard
Taliessin and his poetry ; the vision of
the Styx ; the plunging of the great spear
into the lake in the ritual of the Fisher
King as the mountaineers dance in the
death-orgy of their race and their
religion . . . It is not only strange, teem-
ing with strangeness, but it works; while
it is happening you believe it; and when
Merlin calls an owl out of the air and
thrusts it under his cloak, near the end
of the book, and calmly changes the bird
into a woman who flies away to haunt
young men’s dreams, it seems the most
ytnfg( thing in the world.
In recent contemporary writing there
has been only one other novel you could
compare with this book, Thomas Mann’s
Dr. Faustus, which was equally difficult,
equally formidable, equally impressive
and, based in music instead of in nature,
much narrower in its general interest.
Otherwise, to find anything with the same
quality of mystical excess, you would
have to go to D. H. Lawrence, to
Dostoevsky, even to the storm scenes of
“King Lear” —the drive of a truly great
novel is lacking in Porius but not the
largeness and depth and originality of
vision that only a great mind can
display.
LALIQUE.
Iris, lilac, lily, milk,
Sketched on air and watered silk
The flaxen frozen paddocks He
Beneath the pearl-shell of the sky.
Between the furrows, orchid-
white,
Shadows green as malachite;
A filament river mauve and chill
Unspools below the muslin hill.
Scratched-on fences, in a net,
Gleam like cobweb rainbow-wet;
Plumbago mare with frosty mane
Now winces at the lark-far train.
Chalky shack’s still charmed, and
yet
Chimney smokes a cigarette,
And from the zinc-white roof
there stings
A smack of tin like glassy wings.
One wink more the blond-scape
stays
Curved in lalique, whorl of haze:
Iris, jonquil, fragile, spare,
Pricked on silk and champagne
air.
TASMANIA.
HAL PORTER.
Peach Blossom.
One of the extraordinary propositions
advanced in Ernst Lehrs’s Man Or Matter
(Faber) is the possibility of making bombs 1
out of peach-blossoms; or, at least, their
color, or the force that makes their
color:
The reason why this fourth and highest
metamorphosis of Light does not appear in
the ordinary spectrum is because it is of
too spiritual a quality to be caught by the
optical apparatus Stronger means are
needed than the mere optical transforma-
tion of light-filled spaces. This stronger
agent, according to Rudolf Steiner, is mag-
netism. With the aid of this it will be
possible to organise together round a
common spatial centre that part of the
activity of levity which escapes the optica!
instrument and thus remains cosmic, and
that part which appears by itself in terres-
trial space.
Once this is practically carried out, we
may expect a complete color-circle to
appear as already divined by Goethe. The
full circle consists of 12 discernible colors,
with the Goethean peach-blossom diametri-
cally opposite the green. It is in this region
of the peach-blossom that —again according
to Rudolf Steiner —we shall find a source
of actively working life sources, springing
from the fourth metamorphosis of levity.
Such is the prospect for research work
guided on the new lines.
Dr. Lehrs’s confidence that the unlock-
ing of this new force, if it exists, will not
result in any invention “detrimental to
the true progress of mankind” can hardly
be shared: as soon as man discovers any
new force capable of making an explosion
he instantly tries to blow his own
demented head off with it. But there is,
perhaps, some reason for optimism in the
probability that science is not likely to
take Dr. Lehrs very seriously; at least
not yet.
He is too much of a heretic for that.
Roundly declaring that light has never
been measured,” totally discounting Ein-
stein’s Special Theory,, and inclined to
believe that the scientists have “invented”
the atom which they have split with such
a resounding bang, and at the same time
attempting to find a fresh validity in
astrology and believing literally in the
existence of “the music of the spheres’
he is indeed an astonishing writer to come
Upon in modern times; and, if some-
times suffering from excessive enthusiasm,
by no means an unimpressive one.
He has, in fact, Eddington’s authority
for asking, “When Lord Rutherford
showed us the atomic nucleus, did he find
it or did he make it?”; science is with
him, part of the way, anyhow, in discover-
ing the “cosmic rays,” and for the music
of the spheres he has the word of Kepler
in science that “the universe is ordered
according to the laws of music” and, more
importantly, since Dr. Lehrs is one of
the few scientific writers prepared to be-
lieve that mystics and creative artists may
have more to tell us about the secrets of
the universe than the scientists peering
into their microscopes and telescopes,
there is the testimony of Shakspeare in
Lorenzo’s famous lines in “The Merchant
of Venice” and, even more emphatically,
the poetry of Traherne, who thought he
could remember a life before birth —
Then did I dwell within a World of Light
Distinct and seperat from all Mens Sight,
Where I did feel strange Thoughts, and
such Things see
That were, or seemd, only reveald to
Me , . .
... A Pulpit in my Mind
A Temple and a Teacher I did find,
With a large Text to comment on. No Ear,
But Eys them selvs were all the Hearers
there.
And evry Stone, and Evry Star a Tongue,
And evry gale of Wind a Curious Song.
When discussing Traherne, incidentally.
Dr. Lehrs several times pays tribute to
the researches of the Australian scholar,
Miss Gladys Wade.
On Dr. Lehrs’s own Curious Song the
present reviewer, who would sooner go
over Niagara Falls in a barrel than look
at a page of algebra or attempt to under-
stand a diagram, is incapable of giving
a worth-while opinion from any sort of
scientific viewpoint. Dr. Lehrs is a
disciple of Rudolf Steiner, who is himself
a disciple of Goethe, and the whole of
Man Or Matter may be described as an
elaboration and clarification of Goethe’s
theory of color as outlined in that de-
lightful book Eckerman’s Conversations
with Goethe and Goethe’s own scientific
papers: briefly, that color is not “con-
tained” in light as Newton taught but is
always the result of the penetration of
matter by light; and that the way to
learn the principles of the universe is not
to study this or that phenomenon isolated,
through a microscope—the “one-eyed,
color-blind outlook” characteristic of all
contemporary mathematical science—but
to “read the book of nature” so that in
one glance you see a plant, for example,
whole, as a spiralling, upsurging mani-
festation of the life-force, in continuous
movement from the seed to its own seed-
time, with the flower as the culmination
of its “spiritual being.”
It is a viewpoint which leads Dr. Lehrs,
as it led Goethe, to see spiritual forces at
work even in cloud formations and to
reject altogether the theory that life
appeared on the earth by chance or acci-
dent: “Mankind, and all the other king-
doms of nature, are bound up organically
with the earth from the start of its
existence. Moreover, just as the highest
plants, seen with Goethe’s eyes, are the
spiritual originators of the whole realm
of plants—the creative Idea determining
their evolution —so we see man, the
highest product of earth-evolution, stand-
ing behind this evolution as its Idea from
the first, and determining its course. The
evolutionary changes which we observe
in the earth and in man are in fact a single
process, working through a variety of
manifested forms.” Ruskin, from whom
Dr. Lehrs frequently quotes, said much
the same thing.
On the whole, in spite of the menacing
possibilities it reveals in peach-blossoms,
Man Or Matter is thus a stimulating
essay ; a step at least towards forming
that bridge between science and religion
which most people are looking for in this
bewildered age. And, in spite of a couple
of pages of algebra, it is very pleasant
reading, enlivened with many odd facts
from nature and science and doubly in-
teresting for its excursions into English
and German literature.
Mirabeau.
Mr. Oliver J. G. Welch , !
Mirabeau (Cape) as a “study,”
his readers in the preface th f “ifioufr
cast in biographical form, tb
not intended to be a full t . ;1
“Studies” of 340 pages are
lively easy to make of subject
written abotit as Mirabeau,
when there exists such documi
is contained in the vast sera
“mimolres” comprised in the life work
of Moodgny and such succinct analyses
of events bearing on the matter as the
works of Louis Madelin. Mr. Welch’s
book might be better classified as an
'interpretation” rather than a “study”—
a translation of a statement of Mira*
beau’s position in history into the
language and thought of the current
generation of students. What he attempts
to do is to make a “modern” approach to
facts already known and written.
The work traces the extraordinary life-
history of the son of the even more
extraordinary Friend of Man from the
cradle to the grave, and there is nothing
very much new in it except its author’s
viewpoint. The noisy, erratic, Gargan-
tuan, irresponsible, orderly-minded, dis-
orderly-behaved plagiarist-o ra t o r—he
is the same Mirabeau unde
Welch’s treatment whom five gen
have known: the overwhelming
tornado who lived for 40 years
attracting attention beyond a
circle save through his vice and e
city, and who then, in two years,
of those swept into the F r
revolutionary movement “by p
mortification or personal cupiuuy,
became its “v oi c e,” and made a
name which is known to every European
schoolchild a century and a half later,
without having achieved anything specific
except oratory or gained anything except
pain and frustration of purpose, if a
man whom Mr. Welch describes as a
“democratic monarchist” could be cap-
able of owning anything so specific as to
be called a purpose.
As a “democrat,” even by the defini-
tions of the time, he could scarcely have
been awarded a championship ribbon,
for judges in such matters are less im-
pressed by oratorical conformation than
by indiscretions such .as “I hate and fear

A BELATED BUDGET.
Despite a spate of spurious astonishment
and simulated panic in quarters which
thereby proclaim their various vested
interests in what the Commonwealth Bank
report calls “dangerous elements of in-
stability” in the national economy, the
Federal Budget is, in the broad and large,
a necessary infliction on a community
which has made perfectly plain that, from
top to bottom, it will do nothing to
combat inflation voluntarily and prefers
to be compelled by Government action.
Compulsion to the task being the
accepted process, therefore, the criticism
of the Budget—the only instrument for
such action which the Government
possesses—should be restricted legitimately
to the question whether it fairly spreads
the burdens. While some of the Budget
provisions are certainly severe, the best
evidence that the Treasurer has fairly
spread the burdens is the outcry from
all interests alike.
These interests, one and all, have been
warned for months past that taxation
would have to rise under (1) the obligation
to restore the nation’s fighting services
(notoriously neglected under the Chifley
Government) and (2) to reduce the volume
of spending-power in the hands of the
public which has been boosting inflation
by maintaining non-essential and waste-
ful enterprises. The public has also been
warned that these mushroom growths of
a post-war boom period where no foreign
competition existed to check them must
be sharply reduced in order to conserve
manpower and materials for the prior
demands of rearmament and develop-
ment of basic industries, those which form
the foundation of any national security
and development. The Budget un-
doubtedly hits excrescences, and the
Treasurer was in duty bound to see that
it did so.
The “Labor” Opposition, whose leader’s
chief interest in any Government pro-
posal is to distort it, talks about “horror”
and “a blueprint for depression.” Every-
thing he says against the Budget applies
equally to the report, published simul-
taneously, of the Commonwealth Bank
governor, erstwhile “Labor’s” white-haired
boy. Dr. Coombs’s diagnosis of the
condition of the Australian economy
differs in no point from the Treasurer’s.
He declares that prices have been soaring
as a result of:
Larger volume of imports which through
higher prices overseas exerted strong pres-
sure upon domestic prices and costs.
The basic-wage award of an additional
£1 a week.
Competitive bidding to divert scarce
labor and materials from basic industries
and developmental projects to consumer-
goods Industries.
The resultant “dangerous elements of
instability,” reports Dr. Coombs, are
rising costs of imports while export prices
are falling, rapid expansion of non-
essential production while basic materials
remain short, and the reckless pursuit of
increased money-incomes in these circum-
stances.
This is the structure of inflation which
the Government is pledged to attack,
which the country has demanded it shall
attack, and which might well have been
attacked in just this way last year. If
the Treasurer is to be reproached, it
should be on the grounds that his Budget
measures are a year overdue ; but with
general elections looming 12 months ago
the postponement, especially with the call
for rearmament against Russian aggres-
sion then only beginning to be heard, was
one in which any Government might have
sought a respite.
Treasurer Fadden is being charitable
to his critics in saying that they ought by
now to understand the national problem
in its real dimensions. They probably
do understand, but are merely asserting
those pressure-group tactics whose en-
couragement during the Chifley Govern-
ment’s regime was part of the corruption
under “Labor” of political sentiment in
the electorate. It seems to be necessary
to impress on this democracy, priding
itself as it does on its cultural equipment
for self-government, that this Govern-
ment —or any Government that might be
in its place—is committed to:
Engaging in the war in Korea.
Providing for re-establishment of the
fighting services against a threat of war
from Communist Russia which has set the
whole democratic world rearming for de-
fence.
Maintaining the “welfare State” and its
all-embracing programme of “social
security.”
Carrying out the sacred pledges given
by all parties for the care of incapacitated
ex-soldiers and the dependants of the
fallen.
The outcry is now going up from
vested interests in a way of life as in-
stable as a pyramid poised on its tip, con-
sisting of a five-day week, nominally of
40 hours and actually less ; cigarettes, ice-
creams and picture theatres all day long ;
lotteries in four States out of six, and
in one of them drawn daily six days a
week ; betting on commercialised sport as
the chief nation-wide preoccupation;
mass dependence for spiritual and mental
culture on the crooners and propagan-
dists of the radio; and one working-
citizen in every four or five relying on
Government employment as a chosen
existence. Nobody in his senses could
believe that White Australia can be
preserved in strength and initiative on
such an utterly false basis of existence.
The condition is one that requires shock
treatment, and in the regions where the
Budget administers that treatment it can
be nothing but salutary.
Imposts by direct taxation are not only
equitable over all —a welcome change
from the class taxation of the Socialists —
but comparatively light. Even on the tax-
payer, without dependants, receiving £lOOO
a year—the rank at which increasing
numbers of “wage slaves” are arriving—
the extra amount of income-tax is only
£l3 10s. a year, and for the citizen with
wife and two children on the same mark
it is only £lO a year—£lo3 in all. How
are higher pensions for aged, widows,
invalids and needy ex-servicemen (and
“Labor” says the increases are still far
too small) to be provided except from
the earnings of the working population?
Commercial companies protest that the
Treasurer is hitting them hard, but
“Labor” would perhaps have hit them
harder ; and while in some purely luxury
enterprises pruning had been obviously
required in these inflationary times, other
concerns, necessary to the work of the
nation, were also due to set their house
in order against the day of return to the
market of international competitors like
Germany and Japan. These, like the in-
dividual whose man-hour performance
pin-points the post-war deficiency in our
economy, have got to increase output —
under sacrifice of profits, if necessary—
for the welfare of the Australia that is
to be.
Taxpayers in this land are still on
velvet by comparison with those in any
other country in the world. Such de-
privations as we suffer in current shortages
that affect our unmatched day-to-day liv-
ing standard are nothing but our own
fault.
Unionism Most Peculiar.
The New South Wales State Branch of
the Australian Railways Union was one
of the first Australian trade-union bodies
to associate itself with Communism and
Moscow.
In 1924, after its officials Messrs.
Smith and Rymer had been in Moscow
with Mr. J. S. Garden, a Mr. A. E.
Chapman followed them home. Before
the war (according to the “Labor Daily”
of that period) Mr. Chapman had been
“associated with the syndicalist move-
ment.... was well-known in interna-
tional affairs and worked in close co-
operation with the German and French
syndicalists.” He had been “compelled
to leave England” and been deputed after
the war “by the Shop Steward Move-
ment to go to Russia and Germany for
the purpose of investigation.” He arrived
in Sydney and plunged into the organisa-
tion of Communist fraternals.
Immediately the Federal Executive of
the A.R.U. discovered that there was
something wrong with the Sydney
branch, deposed the local secretary—an
old moderate stalwart, Mr. Buckley—
charging him with every union crime in
the calendar in the usual Communist
manner, and though there were 49 other
applicants for the position, mostly Labor
men with long records of service, it
installed Comrade Chapman in the job.
In 1931 the A.R.U. applied for
membership of the Red International
of Labor Unions, the working army of
the Comintern formed for the purpose of
capturing the trade-unions. The address
of this sinister body was in a Soviet
Government building, Dvoretz Truda,
Solianka 12, Moscow, U.S.S.R. Its
secretary was Solomon Losovsky, after-
wards a commissar in the Russian
Foreign Office and chief propagandist and
Press-relations officer of the Soviet Union
during the war. The A.R.U.’s letter ask-
ing for affiliation declared:
My Australian council is desirous of
making known to railwayman tbe aims and
objects of the R.I.L.U. and seeks to enlist
their support. Co-operation at your end to
enable this to be done would be greatly
appreciated.
The N.S.W. branch of the A.R.U.
entered enthusiastically into this plan.
When the R.I.L.U. blossomed on a start-
lingly large scale and with great sudden-
ness in N. S. Wales during the depression,
and with a newspaper of its own which
was initiated with a page of greetings
from almost every top Communist party
in the world, the A.R.U. took a leading
part in its operations—in the formation
of a literature bureau which sold
exclusively Communist literature from
Moscow, in the formation of a “move-
ment against imperialist war and for the
defence of the Soviet Union,” in the
formation of a Workers’ Defence Corps
(on the lines of the Red Front, a military
Communist body organised in Berlin),
and in the propagation of the Leninist
slogan “Every factory, every ship, every
mine a fortress of Revolution.” This
slogan was used as the heading of an
article which announced the election of
the N. S. Wales R.I.L.U. executive in
1931. An A.R.U. representative on it
was Comrade J. A. Ferguson, then a
prominent member of the Communist
party and now the Federal president of
the A.L.P.
Upon the death of Comrade Chapman,
the A.R.U. secretary, the Communist
party and others accorded him a “Red”
funeral —the first held according to
Moscow rites in Australia. The A.R.U.
appointed in his stead Dr. Lloyd Ross, a
Communist officer who later succeeded
in being both a leading Communist and
a leading member of the A.L.P. at the
same time, and who was one of those
who saddled the N. S. Wales conference
of 1940 with the notorious “Hands Off
Russia” resolution. Mr. Rosevear
(Federal “Hansard,” 1940, p. 507) said;
The facts cannot be denied. Dr. Lloyd
Ross, the notorious Communist and secre-
tary of the Australian Railways Union, was
denied admittance by the federal executive
to the unity conference, but he showed up
at the Easter (N.S.W.) conference, which
passed the “Hands Off Russia” resolution
—he was one of the committee which drew
up the so-called war policy of the [Labor]
party.
Within a year Dr. Lloyd Ross had
left the Communist party, entered the
highest councils of the Labor party and
soon had become public-relations officer
of the Post-war Reconstruction Depart-
ment under Mr. Dedman, and was
employed mostly on the promotion of the
Socialisation-in-Ten-Years programme
formulated by the N. S. Wales Labor
party. He explained his defection from
the Communist party by referring his
critics to the dicta of Lenin, who advised
that missionaries should go where the
field for making converts was widest.
Dr. Ross was succeeded in the A.R.U.
branch secretaryship in N. S. Wales by
Mr. J. A. Ferguson, who had been on
the R.I.L.U. executive and who had been
chosen to join with Mr. William Orr, the
secretary of the R.I.L.U. in N, S. Wales
and a member of the Communist central
committee, to sponsor at the All-
Australian Conference of Trade-unions in
1934, under direct advice from Comrade
Losovsky in Moscow, a resolution to
abandon arbitration. Comrade Ferguson
presently left the Communist party, and
immediately rose to power and position
in the A.L.P. In 1946, in the chair at
the N. S. Wales A.L.P, annual confer-
ence he invited the Communist party to
disband and join the Labor party
en masse.
Mr. Ferguson now professes to be a
sterling moderate. The 1948 Triennial
Labor Conference which paved the way
for his presidency of the Federal Labor
body reaffirmed its repudiation of the
methods and principles of the Communist
party and declared by resolution that
there is such basic hostility and differ-
ences that no Communist can be a member
of the Labor party. No Communist
auxiliary or subsidiary can be associated
with the Labor party in any activity, and
no Labor-party branch or member can co-
operate with the Communist party The
Communist party’s methods and objects
aim at the destruction of the democratic
way of life of the Australian people and
the" establishment in its place of a totali-
tarian form of government which would
destroy our existing democratic institu-
tions and the personal liberty of the Aus-
tralian people.
But the matter goes further than that.
When the A.R.U. affiliated with
Losovsky’s Red International in 1931,
and Mr. J. A. Ferguson sat on its N. S.
Wales executive, there was no doubt
about the fact that its programme came
from Moscow. Indeed, in its letter ask-
ing for affiliation the A.R.U. asked
Moscow for instruction.
The Federal Executive of the A.R.U.,
which includes the majority of Australian
railway workers, is still a Communist-run
body. Its Federal president is Mr. J. J.
Brown, a member of the Communist-
party central committee. He has just
returned from Bucharest and Moscow,
and an abridgment of the speech which
he made at the National Congress of the
Communists last month has been printed
in the “Communist Review”;
I have been asked to express greetings
to this Congress from the General Confede-
ration of Labor in Rumania and from the
Central Council of Trade Unions in the
Soviet Union. In particular I have been
asked by the leading comrades in the
trade-union movement of the two countries
concerned to express fraternal greetings to
Comrade Sharkey, and you would have
been pleased to have heard the expressions
of interest and concern about Comrade
Sharkey’s health after his release from
Jail, which shows the interest in other
lands towards the leader of our party in
Australia.
Comrade Sharkey was sent to jail for
advocating that Australians should
traitorously welcome invading Russians,
but Comrade Brown devoted minutes of
his speech to assuring the locals that the
Russians were stunned and bewildered at
the spectacle of the Menzies Government
arming Australia, and could not under-
stand what the warmongers here could
be arming against;
In discussion with the presidium of the
central committee of the Central Council
of Railway Workers Union [of the
U.S.S.R.] they wanted to know from me.
But who does your Government say your
country should be armed against?” “How
does your Government try to justify the
disruption of the national economy by their
war preparations ?”
The N.S.W. branch of the A.R.U. is
under no illusions about what the union
membership of the World Federation of
Trade-unions, the successor of the
R.I.L.U. and a body run from Moscow
and Peking, means. At the conference
of the branch last week, with the Acting
Governor-General present at the opening,
Mr. J. V. Holt in his presidential address
said a “small section” in the union—it is
large enough, of course, to direct the
union’s Federal policy and secure that its
Federal heads are Communist officials —
was prepared to smash the A.R.U. and
destroy the economy of the nation, bring-
ing men, women and children into a
state of servitude and degradation in its
desire to have a foreign ideology and
philosophy. Mr. J. A. Ferguson, as the
State secretary—the first non-Communist
in a quarter of a century to hold the
office in the N. S. Wales branch, he
himself having been a Communis*
half his period of service with the i
—said that “Communist minoritie
cunning methods and skilful manipul
now controlled major unions, and
striving to control the N. S. Wales bra;
of the A.R.U.” He said, according
“S. M. Herald” report:
There is absolutely no doubt in my mit
as to the real intent associated with Com-
munist endeavors Vital political de-
cisions encouraging economic sabotage of
the democracies are handed down through
the various trade departments of the Com-
munist-controlled World Federation of
Trade-unions to form part of a major
conspiracy.
There could be no doubt in Mr.
Ferguson’s mind. As one who was in
the heart of Communist operations for
years such a statement coming from him
is not one of opinion; it is an utterance
of fact straight from the horse’s mouth —
from one who knows by past participa-
tion in Communist operations at a high
level.
Mr. Ferguson is Federal president of
the A.L.P., the policy-making body, the
disciplinary body, the politbureau. the
high court of Labor all in one. B
as a member of the Labor party £ r
union branch as a section of the
Wales branch of the Labor par
bound by a specific Federal con
resolution passed in 1948 which
them to “associate” or co-opera
the Communist party or any “Cor
auxiliary or subsidiary.” They are liable
to expulsion from the Labor party if
they transgress this rule.
Yet in the face of the specific instruc-
tion and ruling of the Federal conference
of which Mr. Ferguson is the current
president and spokesman, he himself is an
employee of a union of which the Federal
Executive is obviously a Communist
auxiliary, and which the Royal Com-
mission in Victoria found had lent itseh
to Communist purposes in the 1946
strike. He must associate in his employ-
ment in trade-union affairs with the
Federal president of his union, a Com-
munist official who has been acting as go-
between with Moscow and who
the policy of the uhion in its
aspects.
What does the Federal Executive of the
A.L.P. think of this peculiar position.
What does Dr. Evatt think of it? What
do trade-unionists and Australians in
general think of it in the light of the
fact that when Federal Labor is in pov- ei
Mr. Ferguson, as president of the A.L.I
Executive, is the de facto head ot tn
real Government of the country who>
orders the Labor Cabinet is pledged
carry out, and in fact does carry out.


PLAIN ENGLISH
In the Garden of Eden.
This week both U.N.O. (of which ironi-
cally a Persian delegate is president) and
the Attlee Government have their last
chances to maintain their prestige in
western Asia.
Last July, Dr. Moussadek’s hysteric
Persian Government having wantonly and
without notice cancelled its long-term
concession to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com-
pany, the British Government, as the
company’s majority shareholder, appealed
to the International Court, the highest
judicial authority of U.N.O. The court
issued a provisional injunction prohibit-
ing either party from subverting the rights
of the other under the agreement which
the Persians already had flagrantly
broken.
The Persians decided to ignore the
finding, claiming that the dispute was
domestic between themselves and a private
concern but at the same time belying
this view by negotiating with the British
and United States Governments. After
a series of insults, aggressions and threats
to invoke the aid of Russia, combined
with progressive invasion of the Abadan
refinery, the Persians forbade British sub-
jects to leave the country without special
permits, then issued notices of expulsion
against all Britons at Abadan, occupied
the works with a military division, began
to mine the environs of Abadan and
closed the Persian frontiers against
movement of British subjects.
All the Persian acts involve violent
flouting of the order of the U.N.O.
International Court, and, in the words of
the British Foreign Office request to the
Security Council to meet immediately,
have “created a situation which might
well be thought to justify the use of force
in order to preserve British rights and
interests.” The British Government said
it was “reluctant to take any steps which
might weaken the authority of the United
Nations, on whose principles” its “policy
is based,” At the same time it represented
to the Security Council that Persia’s open
defiance of the International Court’s
order “can only result in the substitution
of the rule of force for the rule of inter-
national law.”
Public opinion in England, slow to light
up in these days, is fast coming to life.
Mr. Attlee gives the appearance of firm-
ness. He Has announced that the Govern-
ment regards the products of the South
Persian oil industry as remaining the
property of the Anglo-Iranian Co., and
that he proposes to take all practicable
steps to prevent any attempt by the
Persian Government to sell it to third
parties. The cruiser Mauritius and three
or four destroyers are already in the
Shat-el-Arab River or near its mouth,
close to the site of the Garden of Eden.
Britain and U.N.O. have reached
the point where they must either show
their teeth and strength or give their
prestige in the Mohammedan world away.
Sydney Press Hysteria.
If they judged by the outburst —led by
“S. M, Herald”—in their daily papers,
Sydney people could have believed that
utter ruin would follow the Budget, that
buying of food and clothing would cease,
unemployment run riot, credit collapse
overnight, the banks close their doors and
the populace be reduced to penury and
starvation.'
“5.M.H.,” after columns of rubbish of
which this is a fair sample:
It is time to realise that if we wish to
keep the system of free enterprise, as
opposed to a complete and rigid Soviet
socialised State, there is a limit to the tricks
of this sort that can be played—
had the effrontery to tell the Prime
Minister that he ought to withdraw the
Budget and prepare another more likely to
please “S.M.H.” But the paper’s re-
porters, instead of finding panic on the
Stock Exchange, had to report that the
sharemarket showed no “discernible re-
action” and a “steadying tone was more
pronounced.”
The “Sun” listed increased prices as a
result of the Budget, declaring that suits,
shoes, shirts, socks, overcoats and dressing-
gowns would all be dearer. Whereupon
the president of the Apparel Manufac-
turers’ Association said: “Reports that
clothing prices will rise as a direct result
of the Budget are misleading and untrue.”
And an “executive of one of Sydney’s
biggest retail softgoods stores” said, “I
don’t think it wffl have very much effect
on retail stores such as ours.”
There was no hysteria outside Sydney.
Melbourne “Argus,” no friend of the
Menzies Government, said the Treasurer
had “taken a course proper to the cir-
cumstances of the day” and what re-
mained was to see if it would work as a
brake on inflation. Adelaide “Advertiser”
praised the Government’s courage and
called on everybody to “accept as neces-
sary the sacrifices which the Budget en-
tails,” stating further that “In budgeting
for the large surplus of £ll4 million the
Treasurer is making effective use of one
of the most powerful anti-inflationary
weapons at his command.” Brisbane
“Courier-Mail” pointed out that the
Budget “is not asking the people of Aus-
tralia to shoulder a greater burden than
the peoples of Britain and the United
States,” added that financial adjustments
in those countries “have not resulted in
a trade recession and unemployment,” and
said “There is no reason why Australia
should fear such consequences.”
Unions v. Communists.
The “Yes” vote made a pretty good fight
as the last few hundred thousand ballot-
papers were counted, and the referendum
was not lost by more than a handful
in nearly five million votes.
It has been the closest thing to a dead-
heat this country has seen in any
referendum yet. Quite obviously large
numbers of trade-unionists voted against
Communism and the “Labor”-party
directions, and the A.C.T.U. was
emboldened last week to demand that,
following its recent congress decisions,
certain unions shall now abandon
membership of the Communist W.F.T.U.,
or “be disciplined.”
Among the unions thus challenged
A.C.T.U. president Monk mentioned the
Waterside Workers’ Federation, the Aus-
tralian Railways’ Union, the Miners’
Federation and the Seamen’s Union. Mr.
Monk says “the position cannot be
tolerated.” AH these organisations harbor
as their head - executives notorious
Communists.
Others, like the Melbourne trammies,
the 8.W.1.U. and the Liquor Trades
Urfion, have been ejected from the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council, A.C.T.U.’s
Victorian branch, for some two years
past. Such “disciplinary action” as this
represents merely resulted in “disciplined”
unions withholding union contributions
from Melbourne T.H.C., though not from
the “Labor” referendum campaign. Still,
the “Labor” referendum-claim to be
able to deal with the Communists in
“the movement” in its own way must be
justified somehow.
In N.Z. the Holland Government,
meeting Parliament fresh from its re-
sounding victory on the Communist
issue, has announced in the Governor-
General’s speech legislation to provide for
compulsory secret ballots on strike issues
and to make strike-picketing illegal. It
has also forecast a bill to strengthen
the law against “subversive activities
which tend to stir up ill-will, disaffection
and class-hatred,” while safeguarding
“fundamental individual rights, legitimate
freedom of speech and liberty of
conscience.”
No powers have to be sought there by
referendum. Like the Australian States,
but not like the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, the N.Z. Government possesses full
powers to legislate against Communists
as part of the defence of the country.
That "Larrikin Strain."
The “Labor” Opposition under the new
Evatt leadership had a bad opening week
when Parliament reassembled.
Dr. Evatt’s intrusion of an adjourn-
ment motion just in advance of the
Budget —a defiance of all the traditions
of Parliamentary procedure—was not
only petulant but obvious waste of time,
and based on a demonstrably false
charge.
His motion was to protest against
certain public-service retrenchments. He
said the Government action was
announced “out of the blue,” without
cause or warning. The Prime Minister
in a few minutes’ reply completely floored
him, saying that, on notice of the move,
he had reminded Dr. Evatt that a full
statement was listed for the first sitting-
day this week, that there was no point in
anticipating the debate especially on
Budget Day, and that all members knew
the decision was made after exhaustive
committee inquiries during many months
in the departments, by departmental
heads, and finally by a Cabinet sub-
committee in consultation with them.
Next day the Opposition fell down
again on a series of questions framed in
political spleen and recklessly ill-founded
in fact. “Labor’s” campaign of distor-
tion succeeded in defeating the
referendum, but doesn’t wash when the
mirror can be promptly held up to it in
Parliament. TTie attempt to assail Mr.
D. M. Cleland’s appointment as a deputy
to the Administrator of New Guinea nose-
dived because the “Labor” benches
forgot that the gentleman had “qualifica-
tions without parallel,” as the Minister
said, from a long period of administra-
lion there as a brigadier-general during
the war years.
Then came a series of “Labor” ques-
tions on butter, inspired by allegations
from N.S.W. and Queensland “Labor”
Premiers that the Federal Government
had authorised export of 13,000 extra
tons or 20,000 extra tons (the latter Mr.
McGirr’s statement) of butter while local
people in those States were starved for
butter, withheld from consumers under
State price-fixing of butter at under-
production value. Official returns showed
that not only had less butter than ever
been exported during the past 12 months,
but that during the “Labor” States’
butter-war on dairyfarmers hardly any
butter had been exported at all.
After these knockouts the bodies of
these questions were dragged out of the
ring amid complete silence from the
“Labor” benches —and from the “S. M.
Herald.”
Erosion-control by Law.
Queensland Government’s move to make
soil-conservation compulsory is a bold
lead, made by a State which is not suffer-
ing from erosion to anything like the
same extent as N.S.W, and Victoria,
though the damage is bad enough.
Voluntary methods failed to control
noxious weeds, rabbits, tick- and lice-
infestation of sheep and cattle, swine-
fever in pigs and so forth, and laws have
long been in force compelling landholders
to deal with them. Quite evidently
erosion demands similar control, and the
Queensland measure could be a beginning
of the first importance to all Australia.
It provides for co-operation in control
between neighboring farmers, local and
State authorities; for the State to do
necessary work where the farmer or other
occupier is finable or unwilling to do it
and to charge the cost to the occupier ;
for appeal against orders of the control-
ling authority; for the Minister to
appoint any individual or body to
perform control work ; for proclamation
of areas of permanent pasture where
necessary ; for power of entry for inspec-
tion or survey or other control purposes
and to declare “soil-erosion hazard”
areas ; for resumption of land for control
purposes.
As the Minister admitted, the measure
is “exploratory.” It may not even
go far enough. Soil-preservation is linked
with stock and pasture management,
pasture improvement, fodder-conserva-
tion, water-storage and sundry other
things, including crop management.
Education and demonstration on these
lines should not only continue, but
expand. The mere passage of an Act and
enforcement of its provisions won’t be
sufficient. All the same, the Queensland
measure is the first taste of authority
exercising power in what is one of the
most serious of national problems.
A Church Resurrected.
October 7 will be a great day for exiled
Russians in Australia. A group with
nothing of their erstwhile country left to
cling to but their religion, on October 7
they are going to lay the foundation-
stone of a Russian Orthodox Cathedral,
named St. Peter and St. Paul, at Strath-
field, Sydney.
The Russian Church dates its founda-
tion from a.d. 988, when St. Vladimir,
Prince of Kiev, baptised his people in the
Eastern Christian Faith. It has always
been basically a people’s church, the
highlights in its history its rallying of
the peoples of Russia at the time of the
Mongol invasions, against Polish domina-
tion and during the Napoleonic invasion.
It is a church of martyrs, suffering its
final martyrdom at the hands of Lenin
and Stalin without being obliterated.
Indeed, after religion in Russia had been
stamped into the ground with both feet
by a ruthless Government for 25 years,
Stalin felt compelled to try to resurrect
the church under Communist auspices to
form, as usual in Russian national crises,
a point round which the nation might be
unified in desperate early 1942.
The Russian Church has since the
revolution lived abroad as an organised
whole under the government of a
Metropolitan and a Synod of Bishops,
who have recently moved their head-
quarters from Switzerland to the United
States. In Australia there have been
scattered Russian religious communities,
the most important in Brisbane. In
Sydney there has been the tiny church
of St. Vladimir in a private house. For
20 years past Christ Church St. Laurence
(Anglican) has allowed the great Russian
Church feasts of Easter to be celebrated
within its walls.
The building of the new cathedral has
been opposed by the Communists, who
have infiltrated committees to wreck the
project. At least twice the scheme
was nearly captured by Stalin’s unfriendly
emissaries.
In 1949 the present head of the
Russian Church, Archbishop Raphalsky,
arrived in Sydney with a number of
clergy, all of whom had passed through
D.P. camps in Germany; some also
through the horrors of Russian Com-
munism. Their growing congregations
are largely made up of New Australians.
Parishes are established in all the capitals
of Australia and Maoriland.
The archbishop is enthroned in Sydney
and a bishop in Brisbane. Sydney now
has a magnificent Russian choir, which
gave its first concert in the Sydney Town
Hall in July, and the cathedral,
designed by Mr. R. J. Magoffin, will give
the church organisation a central home
and provide another symbol of the tough-
ness and resiliency of gentle Christian
faiths of brotherly love under persecution.
The Russian Church will probably
continue to be a living force when the
Communist party has assumed its proper
place in history as a half-forgotten
criminal conspiracy parallel to Nazism,
Fascism and the Black Hand of Sicily.
Beer—Bottled and Barrelled.
Highlights of an inquiry:
Evidence heard in the second phase of the
Royal Commission on Liquor in New South
Wales —the first phase uncovered interests of
Tooths and Tooheys in hundreds of city and
country pubs, details of tied houses and
“gentlemen’s agreements” suggested that
licensees of some Sydney hotels are modest
violets who prefer to blush, if at all, unseen.
There’s the Royal Standard Hotel, in Castle-
reagh-street. Francis Charles Harvey told the
commission he bought the lease last July for
£19,860. He denied suggestions that he was
not the real purchaser. He had no partner.
Questioned regarding finance he said he had
had two or three thousand himself and had
borrowed the balance of the purchase price
from his mother. A week later Harvey was
again questioned. He admitted that he had
borrowed “about £8000” from a Mr. Parker.
Parker was now his partner, but had not been
a partner when he advanced the money. Asked
why he banked with an Ashfield bank instead
of a city branch Harvey replied that the
manager was a personal friend, so he thought
he would give him the business. Parker had
paid the money into the Ashfield account.
Mr. Dovey (assisting the Commissioner):
It was a Joan? —Yes. For how long?—
There was no mention of any specific time.
Was anything said in regard to interest? —
No.
Asked by the Commissioner (Mr. Justice
Maxwell) whether the Licensing Court had asked
whether anybody but himself had an interest
in the hotel, Harvey said he had been asked
and he had said “Nobody.”
His Honor: Would it be fair to »ay
this —that you carefully refrained from
finalising the arrangements with Parker until
after the transfer so that you could swear
to having the sole interest in the licence? —
Yes.
Earlier Mr. Dovey had suggested Harvey’s
evidence the previous week had been “a pack
of lies.” Harvey denied this and said “there
must have been a misunderstanding”; there
were too many questions; he was not used to
the witness-box and he was flurried.
Frederick Arthur Parker told the Commission
he had gone into partnership with Harvey a
couple of weeks after he had gone into the
Royal Hotel as manager.
Mr. Dovey: There was no talk of a
partnership before you went into the hotel?
—No. How much did you advance him
on his good name or whatever it was? —
About eight and a half thousand. How
much does that mean? —Really, £9250. Do
you think if I ask you again it might be a
bit more? —No.
Parker denied a suggestion by his Honor
that it looked as if it had been arranged
originally for himself and Harvey to be equal
partners. Asked whose idea it was that the
bank account should be at Ashfield, he said
he had introduced Harvey to the manager. He
and Harvey had agreed that his name should not
appear on cheques to breweries.
His Honor: Won’t you admit that you
put the clause in the agreement in order
that your name should be kept from the
brewery?—Yes; no ulterior motive —just
because they don’t recognise partnerships.
His Honor; You can take it from me
there is a very good reason for somebody
knowing who has an interest in hotels.
Parker was asked why he had listed his wife
and Mrs. Harvey as barmaids. He replied that
it was done “for easier reckoning and quicker
doing of books.”
Another publican whose replies to questions
varied on different days was Abraham Gilbert
Saffron. On his first appearance before the
Commission he said he was licensee of the Glad-
stone Hotel in William-street, and denied that
a Mr. Kincaid, a fellow-director of the Roose-
velt nightclub, had any financial interest in the
Gladstone. He denied that he himself had any
interest in the Hotel Phillip, of which his
brother was licensee, or in the Cumberland
Hotel, Bankstown, of which Mr. Kornhauser
was licensee. He had lent Kornhauser £2040,
and he had given financial assistance —£2000 or
£3OOO to his sister, licensee of the Mortdale
Hotel.
On Thursday, after he had engaged counsel,
similar questions were put to Saffron, and he
admitted that Kincaid had a 50 per cent,
interest in the Gladstone and had put up half
the purchase money. Kincaid also had a 50
per cent, interest in the West End Hotel when
he, Saffron, was licensee. Prior to that the
same arrangement had been in force in respect
to the Newcastle Hotel.
Mr. Dovey : Would this be correct then:
Between you and Kincaid, in respect of the
hotels which you are or have been the
licensee, he at all times has been financially
interested to the extent of 50 per cent, in the
lease, licence and goodwill?—Yes. I suppose
you will admit that Mr. Kincaid’s interest

was at no time disclosed either to the
breweries or the licensing police or the
Licensing Court? —Yes. Failure to disclose
this interest was done deliberately?—Yes.
Saffron also admitted on Thursday to having
a half-interest in the Cumberland Hotel, Banks-
town. Kornhauser, he said, had the other halt.
He further admitted to a two-thirds interest
in the Mortdale Hotel, Kincaid having the other
third.
Mr. Dovey: Using plain language, your
sister is merely a dummy licensee for you
and Kincaid? —Yes. You told your sister
what to say on the licensing questionnaire?
—Yes. You told her to give answers which
to your knowledge and her knowledge
would be untrue? —Yes. You know from
your own experience that she would be
obliged to verify them later on under oath
in the witness-box? —Yes.
Replying to questions regarding the Roosevelt
nightclub Saffron said he had no licence to
sell beer or wines there and he had not sought
one. The Roosevelt sold about 100 dozen
bottles of beer a week. About half this came
from regular suppliers. “A man named Carl
Muro, employed at the Roosevelt, was respon-
sible for getting the rest. Beer was bought at
l/8£ and sold at 4/6 a bottle. He denied
that on one occasion 60 dozen beer was taken
from the Cumberland Hotel to the Roosevelt.
It was taken to the Gladstone, in re
beer previously borrowed.
Carl Muro, asked by Mr. Dovey to
where he got the rest of the Roosevel
said it was delivered in a truck by a mar
George. He didn’t know George’s othe. name
and when he asked him for his phone numb
George had said he “didn’t do busine: th
way.”
Earlier in the proceedings another ....vaS,
Mervyn Alfred Francis, assistant general-
manager of Tooheys, Ltd., had also changed
his mind about the lease of the Cumberland.
He first told the Commission that Kornhauser
was the only person interested in the lease,
but later he admitted that Saffron, who had
been introduced to him by Toohey’s general-
manager, Mr. Calloway, was the guarantor of
the bank account and of the performance of
covenants in the lease. He knew Saffron's
carrier had been fined for taking away 60 dozen
bottled beer from the Cumberland, and he knew
of a report that analysis had revealed added
water in casks of beer at that hotel. In August
he had recommended a renewal of the lease to
Kornhauser, with Saffron guaranteeing all
accounts.
Kornhauser, registered licensee of the Cumber-
land Hotel, admitted that when he went into
the witness-box at the Licensing Court and
swore that no other person was interested in
the Cumberland he knew the statement to be
a lie. In regard to a report that an analysis
had disclosed five per cent, of water in two
large casks of beer at the Cumberland, Korn-
hauser said: “It is still beyond me. I K '’
been away in Melbourne and the .barman
me about it. It might have been some
of the plumbing.
Mr. Dovey: Water might have lea
in? — It might.
The Commission is not sitting this
Hearing will be resumed on Monday.
POLITICAL POINTS
By the weekend progress counting in
the referendum had reduced the “No”
majority to 61,009. This worked out at
50.65 per cent, of the votes then
counted. The Doc. professes he
would rather have won this referendum
than half a dozen general elections. Put
to the test he’d probably settle for one;
and he’d have to poll much better than
this time to get back on the Treasury
benches.
At the Caucus “Victory” meeting
Calwell proposed and Rosevear seconded
a vote of congratulation to Evatt for his
leadership in the “No” campaign. Both
men have been vocal in the past against
Communism ; neither has ever shown any
tendency to hero-worship the Doc. Bert
could take the incident as evidence that
his brilliant leadership had won over
two erstwhile rivals. On the other hand,
recalling that Arthur and Sol could hardly
be ranked among the most active cam-
paigners for “No,” he might have some
misgivings. Whoever gets credit for what
is now called a “victory” must be pre-
pared to be scapegoat if the party later
reassesses the campaign which saved the
Communists.
Agreeing with Calwell that the refer-
endum result is an instruction to the
Government to resign, Sydney “Tribune”
publishes a cable from Harry Pollitt, boss
of the Communists in Britain, to Sharkey.
It reads:
Congratulations on the defeat of Men-
zies’s attack on democracy. The victory
will encourage progressives everywhere to
intensify the fight for peace and freedom.
In the lexicon of Red Fascism democracy
means Communism, progressives are Com-
munists and fellow-travellers; “peace
and freedom” means Russian supremacy.
11 ttacks from all sides are an indica-
tion of a good Budget S’Artie’s is a
winner. “Labor” doesn’t like it; N.S.W.
Chamber of Manufactures doesn’t like
it; the Chamber of Commerce doesn’t
like it; the Retailers’ Association doesn’t
like it; Granny “Herald” and Teenager
‘Telegraph” don’t like it. It’s doubtful
whether Artie likes it much himself, but
at any rate he has produced it. None of
his critics has suggested a workable
lative.
Despite criticism of the Budget from
“spokesmen” of manufacturing and com-
mercial organisations. Stock Exchanges
did not show any unfavorable reaction
to the Fadden proposals. In fact, the fall-
ing tendency noticeable in recent weeks
appeared to have been checked and prices
were steady. The explanation offered is
that the market had anticipated a tough
Budget. A steady market suggests that
it was no tougher than expected.
There will probably be complaints
about the Treasurer’s action in modifying
the averaging provisions of the Income-
Tax Act, whereby the rate of tax payable
by primary producers was calculated on
the basis of the average income over five
years. The provision will now apply
only to the first £4OOO of taxable income;
beyond that figure the taxpayer will be
billed at the rate appropriate to his income
for the current year. The immediate
effect will be to deprive the man with, for
example, a big present income from wool
of the benefit his much lower income of
three and four years ago would give
him under the averaging system. Fadden
estimates the gain to this year’s Budget
at the huge sum of £47 million.
At first sight the averaging change
seems unfair; actually it is farsighted.
If a bad season or a substantial drop in
world prices hits the primary producer
a couple of years hence he would, under
the old system, find himself billed for tax
on and out of a much depleted income at
rates warranted by today’s inflated
figures. That is a prospect that has no
attraction for either the producer or the
Treasury.
On the figures in the Budget papers
“Labor” will find it hard to maintain the
ancient myth of the huge section of
greedy investors who live without work
on dividend rake-off from the hungry toil
of the masses. The Treasury’s dissection of
the income of all recipients gives out
of total personal income of £2,916,000,000
only £80,000,000 dividends and
£118,000,000 rent and interest. Cash
social-service benefits were £144,000,000
—only £104,000,00 1 in “Labor’s” last year
of office.
National Income figures show that since
1939 the class which has benefited least
by income rises are those who depend on
rent and interest. With a huge increase
of population the total has risen only
from £86,000,000 to £118,000,000.
Farmers’ income in that period increased
from £45,000,000 to £757,000,000 and
wages and salaries, etc., from £444,000,000
to £1,450,000,000.
Because of approaching general elec-
tions in Britain, brought about by the
Bevanites’ split from the “Labor” party,
the factions have “decided to bury the
hatchet,” according to a member of the
“Labor” executive. He added, with a
presentiment surely of defeat at the polls,
“But there is a string leading to it so
that we wifi be able to find it quickly.”
Chivvied by various people to declare
open seasons for possums, kangaroos
and wood ducks on the ground of their
causing “great damage to agricultural
production”, N.S.W. Chief Secretary
Clive Evatt (just made president of the
R.S.P.C.A.) remarked that applications
for permission to kill marsupials strangely
coincided with high prices for skins. Told
that wood ducks were destroying rice-
crops he replied that last year the same
plea was made and the rice-crop was a
record. “I am not overgenerous with
permits to destroy native birds and
animals,” he added. May he stay that
way.
Vic. Egg Board continues to amuse,
if madden, the people to whom it is sup-
posed to supply eggs. There was a row
among the members and somebody threw
a punch, whereupon Agriculture Minister
Moss said he’d call for a report. Mean-
time, a committee of inquiry is in Sydney
“studying the N.S.W. egg marketing
system.” N.S.W. has an Egg Board, too,
and the N. S. Welsh, like the Victorians,
have to regard eggs as luxuries.
A minor row broke out in America
when a Tennessee college sacked a pro-
fessor on discovering that he was presi-
dent of a nudist society. It led to claims
for a fifth freedom —to wear clothes or
not, as one pleases. To judge from some
people’s reaction to the Federal Budget,
we’re not going to have much choice.
Playing the Evatt-McGirr game, Ren-
shaw, the McGirr Minister for Lands,
came out with a long statement blaming
the Menzies Government for a £ly million
cut in soldier-settlement this year. There
was a lot of balderdash about “repudia-
tion of obligations” and so forth, but
what Renshaw didn’t say was that the
Commonwealth, sickened by the McGirr’s
confiscations of private lands at robbery
prices, had pulled out of the joint Com-
monwealth-States settlement scheme as
far as McGirr’s State is concerned. Nor
did he say that the seizure of good land
amounts to a shrieking scandal that, if
it were tried in the city instead of in the
country, would have caused violence.
West Australian Wheat Pool is donat-
ing £lO,OOO to the Institute of Agriculture
at the University of W-A. as basis of a
fund for soil-fertility research. The gift
is a tribute to the late Sir James Mitchell,
one of W.A.’s most popular Governors.
It is also a tribute to the commonsense
of the wheat pool. Out of all the money
made from wheat and wool in recent years
little has been donated for necessary
work such as this.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Martin has
amended his State’s Crimes Act so that
a motorist responsible for a road fatality
will be charged with “culpable driving”
instead of manslaughter. This will bring
great comfort to the victims in their last
moments.
External Affairs Minister Casey, back
from a five-weeks’ tour of South-East
Asia, told Parliament that the general
situation was “appreciably better” than
six months ago in the contest against
Communist bandit-campaigns in Indo-
china, Malaya, and the Philippines, and
that in Korea the U.N. forces’ position
was “vastly better,” He is recommending
to Cabinet an overhaul of Australian
diplomatic representation throughout
S.-E. Asia so that Canberra may have
full and direct reports on developments
for quick “diplomatic and other action”
if necessary.
In the throes of Budgetitis, Sydney
“Telegraph” ran across the top of a page
in black letters the streamer: Jobs
“Threatened” by Sales Tax. This was
followed by a two-column heading:
Reduction of Staffs Forecast. Then came
the introduction, in double-column width,
all in bold letters:
High sales tax imposed by the Federal
Budget on “luxury” goods threatened the
jobs of many skilled workers, manufacturers
said last night. They said the effect on
employment would be immediate.
On what was all this founded? Nothing
more than the statement of a Mrs. Max
Cornelius, described as “spokesman for
the Furtraders’ Association of N.5.W.,”
that, in her estimation, about half the
300 employees of the Sydney fur trade
would have to seek other jobs.
Canada’s Minister for Finance has
had a few words to say which might well
be studied by Dr. Evatt and other critics
of the Fadden Budget. Refusing, as our
own Government has refused, to accept
price-control as a remedy for inflation,
he says that the two main weapons against
inflation are a tough taxation policy and
an intense savings campaign. Canadians
would have to accept a temporary reduc-
tion in living standards as the price of
security, as the Dominion would have to
spend about five times as much on defence
as in normal times. They could not have
improved standards and expansion of
industry and at the same time have de-
fence, too. The remarks apply with equal
force to Australia. “Labor’s” answer,
presumably, is to do without defence.
Mrs. L. M. Grounds (“Labor”) won the
by-election for the Launceston seat in
Tasmania’s Legislative Council. Second
woman M.P. to reach the Tasmanian
Parliament, she succeeds her husband, the
late Dr. A. E. Grounds, who was elected
in 1948 in succession to the council’s
first woman member, Mrs. L. M.
Mclntyre, who died in the Lutana air
crash.
Federal Government has appointed a
receiver (Mr. Joyce, late Commonwealth
Auditor-General) for Glen Davis shale-
oil project to sell the assets of the show
by public tender. Minister Spooner said
accumulated losses were £4,000,000, trad-
ing losses are £25,000 a month, and it
would be further gross waste of public
money to go in for extensive building
there to house workers, of whom “40 per
cent, are already living under unsatis-
factory conditions.”
In an attempt to force himself on the
town of Heywood (Vic.), which had
indicated previously it didn’t want him,
Commo Bird, of the Seamen’s Union,
went back there last week with a body-
guard of 40 seamen and was run out of
town a second time. A third time would,
from the signs, be pretty unlucky for
somebody.
Many thousands of years ago, accord-
ing to one school of geographers, the
Atlantic Ocean broke through the Pillars
of Hercules to form the Mediterranean
Sea, then through the Hellespont into
the Black Sea. History is now repeating
itself ; the North Atlantic Treaty is to be
extended to include Greece and Turkey.

"AND IT'S PRINTED

“Becks”: Last word on an alleged
musical instrument. S’Artie Fadden’s
schedule of sales-tax increases refuses to
take sides in the dispute; it lists “jaw’s-
or jew’s-harps” among an assorted collec-
tion of noise-producers including “mouth-
organs, harmonicas, flageolets, ocarinas
and octarines, tonettes, canary warblers,
kazoos, whistles, magic flutes, calls and
blowhorns.”

“Macann”: At two minutes past seven
on bus-strike Friday morning (Sept. 28)
well-crowded old-style tram, bound for
the city, pulled up at the North Sydney
Station stop and a hatless, grey-haired
Digger on crutches with half a leg swing-
ing and a badge in his coat tried to get
hoard right where the young conductor
was standing on the footboard. The able-
bodied who did get aboard, and flappers
already on the tram, and seated and
standing men, and the conductor, all
looked at the crippled Dig., with the
boot of his good leg swung on to the
footboard, balancing on his crutches. He
swung the good leg back again, and the
young conductor, satisfied, pulled the bell-
cord and away they went without him. I
suppose even at that hour of the morning
a tramload of people could reasonably
be called, perhaps not what the crippled
Digger called them, but at least a repre-
sentative cross-section of everyday
Sydney.

“Will Hall”: For years I have been
putting small change into one-armed
bandits with very limited results. The
other day I struck a jackpot on a weigh-
ing-machine. It certainly was a surprise
when I put my penny in the slot to hear a
clatter and bang and have four cards
and ninepence come down the chute. To
top it off, one of the cards had a “fortune”
saying that I was coming into money.

“H.C.8.”: The word “up” must be
giving New Australians a few headaches.
In a way it dominates our lives. We
start the day by waking up, then getting
up. If we hold the bathroom too long
we are asked to “Shake it up.” Should
we have that before-breakfast feeling we
might tell the speaker to “Shut up,” and
if he feels the same way he might take
up the challenge. When we see he’s got
his back up, we’ll probably back down —
but square up, with the face-saver “Oh,
/.
“ Passionfruit —next counter , lady.”
turn it up.” We urge the baby to “Be
a good boy and eat it up,” though we
really mean “down.” Then we drink up
our cuppa, snatch up our hat and bolt up
the street to the bus. On the way to
town we strike up a conversation with a
friend, beginning with the weather: “It’s
to be hoped that wind doesn’t come up
again,” and getting on to “The way things
are going up.” We pick up the paper
and read of a tie-up on the wharves and
a hold-up on the coalfields; in fact, a
general mess-up in industry. It makes
us wonder why people don’t wake up to
Commos. We see that a taxidriver was
held up. We turn to the sporting page
and decide that Lollylegs should win next
up. We resolve to have two bob on him,
all up Nohope. In Europe we suspect
that Russia is up to no good, things seem
up to putty in England and the whole
world seems upside-down. There are
hundreds of other “ups” in this up-and-
down existence, but I dunno, I give up,

“Ex-Gunner”: Heth’s drawing of
the soldier warning the inspecting brass-
hat that his rifle is loaded (B. 26/9/’5l)
reminds me of an inspection comedy in
the regiment which once harbored me.
We used a rather neat routine for rifle
inspection, a combination of “Port Arms”
and “Examine Arms.” After the inspect-
ing officer had run his eagle eye over a
man’s rifle, and had poked his fingers in
the open breech to check that the spring
had been oiled, he would seize the weapon
just below the foresight with his right
hand and swing it towards him in order
to look down the spout. The owner of
the rifle would co-operate in the move-
ment by switching to the “Examine
Arms” position. One morning in
Moresby the lieutenant who was acting
as troop commander came along when
the sar’-major was brushing up our rifle-
drill and decided to carry out an inspec-
tion. Unfortunately he forgot to tell us
to unfix bayonets, with the result that
when he grabbed the first man’s rifle and
tried to swing it into the looking-down-
the-spout position only a most undignified
backflip at the last moment saved him
from cutting his own throat. Heth's
soldier, being a perfect gentleman, would
have warned him, but there weren’t any
gentlemen in our troop.

“Banker”: Another centenary was
celebrated on October 2 —the 100th
anniversary of the purchase by the Bank
of New South Wales of the site of their
head-office in Martin Place, Sydney, The
present building was completed in 1932,
and the inscription on its front porch is
almost a history of Australian banking.
It reads:
Bank of New South Wales established in
1817 at the house of Mrs. Mary Reiby in
Macquarie Place. The present site was
purchased on 2nd October 1851. The first
head office premises were erected thereon
in the year 1853 and added to in 1876. To
allow for rebuilding the old premises were
demolished between the years 1927 and
1929. The erection of this building was
commenced on 22nd August 1927 and com-
pleted on 19th March 1932.

“Bo”: Nothing is more calculated to
nark the buyer pursuing his usual routine
of replacing a commodity he is out of
than to be caught up in a panic rush
caused by expected scarcity or price-rise.
Worst part of it is the supercilious smile
of the chain-store salesgirl, a clear sign
that she thinks him one of those indi-
viduals who, on hearing the news, rush
madly from one store to another to save
about eightpence on a year’s supply of
the affected article, becoming so exhausted
in the process that he has to repair to a
pub and spend several bob on restoratives.
Down to my last razor-blade when the
Budget broke, and caught up in the herd
at Bullworth’s queue, I tried to look casual
when I asked for my packet, but I still
felt like a burglar unjustly accused of
doing a “job.” Yet I reflect that the fellow
who whizzed around and beat the gun
by buying a needed piano would be given
a smiling welcome and be regarded by
the salesman as a real shrewdhead.

“Bass”: Till now I’ve admired a
bloke in South Africa who first came
to my notice when he cabled a story of
two trees, a peach and a walnut, which
were growing side by side. They were
chopped down and became grafted
together, and the resultant fruits were
peaches, with walnuts instead of peach-
stones. That was good and, when I re-
covered, I liked it. He followed that with
a yarn about a native child which, left
by its mother at the edge of a crop she
was harvesting, played with a snake for
two hours —unnoticed by anyone. When
that one got through I conceded that the
bloke was a genius. I was a bit dis-
appointed with his tale of a lion which,
having lost its tongue in a fight, was
found lying on its back under a tap catch-
ing the drips in its mouth. Still, it’s
not bad. But now he’s come across with
the story of a thief who, using a rod
and a line, hooked a bloke’s trousers
containing £45 through a window. I’ve
heard that one before. Thus does litera-
ture decline.

“Hamer”: Hugh Maclean (B. 19/9/’5l)
had special qualifications for his work
as boxing writer and illustrator. In his
young days he won, two years in succes-
sion, Victorian amateur championships.
Years after that Hughie and I were en-
gaged in the pleasant occupation of find-
ing out what the bottom of beer-mugs
looked like when another patron of the
bar, in quarrelsome mood, tried to pick
an argument. Hughie ignored him until
he became too aggressive. “Look, I don’t
believe in fighting,” he said quietly. “But
before you start anything, you’d better
look at that.” “That” was a gold medal
he had won for his fistic prowess. Then
he turned his back and resumed his
research-work. The sharp slam of the
bar door indicated that the quarrelsome
bloke had gone for his life.

“Airs-crew”; Unusual war memorials
(B. 5/9/’51)? In Kadina (S.A.) stands
a 12-roomed high school built with money
(subscribed by district residents for a
memorial after World War I. The Kadina
Park Memorial High School, opened in
1924, is a tangible reminder to youngsters
of the sacrifices made by an older genera-
tion. With the consent of the Education
Department it was arranged that one
room should be maintained by the R.S.L.
sub-branch for use by its members. When
the Diggers migrated to larger quarters
in 1939 the room was converted into a
first-class library.

“Villefair”: That Gurkha who dropped
an officer with a stomach punch in order
to save his life (B. 12/9/’5l) certainly
deserved the medal —if only for his origin-
ality. For three decades at least Holly-
wood heroes have, with the most noble
of motives, been knocking out their best
cobbers, but not one has so far thought
of the solar-plexus hit —which would
produce the same effect without danger
of broken teeth, lacerated mouth, frac-
tured jaw or death from cerebral
haemorrhage. The scene has become a
prefab.: In spit© of the fact that the
thumpee has invariably won a former
fight after being knocked down at least
nine times with the most savage of round-
house swings, he needs but one clip on
the chin from the self-sacrificing hero to
put him to sleep. He usually gently falls
forward onto his mate’s shoulder, to be
reverently draped on a bunk. Five
minutes later he recovers and staggers to
the door—just in time to see the self-
sacrificer taking off to test the plane that
both know will fall to pieces in mid-air.
Somebody ought to explain to sc ri ~*-

collapse and the smiter will retur .
earth—to face a charge of manslaughter.

“Teeperce”: At Barce (North Africa)
in 1941, the provosts came to collect our
regiment’s bag of Italian prisoners. A
hurried dispatch of runners to all points
of the landscape resulted in a sizeable
swag of prisoners obligingly sauntering
back to the compound, and they were
handed over to the provosts with the pious
wish that the number would be something
like that shown on the official list. Some
hours later came a request to explain
why the number of prisoners was 30
in excess of our recorded tally. We could
do no more than suggest that the extra
bodies had joined their mates without the
formality of surrendering, while none of
those officially captured had seen fit to
leave the comfortable environs of their
durance vile, despite our easygoing
supervision.

“Vingter”: An urchin who received
fiercer, though more transitory, publicity
in connection with court circles than
“Boy Jones” (B. 12/9/’5l) was William
Austin, the central figure in “The Deli-
cate Investigation” which occurred during
the estrangement and separation of the
future George IV and his wife, Caroline
of Brunswick, Princess of Wales. George
ITT sided with his daughter-in-law against
his son in the frequent quarrels until the
latter dropped his bombshell accusation
that the princess had given birth to a
male child, which she was passing off as
the son of Sophia Austin, one ot her
serving women. The prince based ms
charge on information supplied by Lady
Douglas, erstwhile bosom confidant o
Caroline, that the Princess of Wales had
on several occasions hinted at her own
approaching maternity and had later been
seen performing for a male infant tas s
which would hardly have been expecte.
of a future queen in the service of a chi
of one of her serving maids. The learne
legal lords who sat on the Delicate in-
vestigation commissioned by George
took quite a time examining evidence
before they delivered their verdict that tne
child fondled by Princess Caroline was,
in fact, the child “William Austin,
of the body of Sophia Austin at the
Browlow-street Hospital on July *
1802.” William Austin’s subsequen
career remains as obscure as his opem »
years were highlighted.

“The Press has been quizzing the Man in the
Street on the Federal Budget; and the N. S. Wales
Premier, Mr. McGirr, has volunteered the opinion
that the Budget is ‘a tragedy.’' At the same time,
he announced heavy increases in rail, tram and bus
tares.”
If you’ve a theory, do not grudge it:
What d’ you think of Fadden’s Budget?
Chemists, carpenters and drapers
Get their photos in the papers:
“Taxing lipstick? Nothing worse is—•
This will lead to more divorces!”
“Raising ice-creams, sweets and toys?—
Boys no longer will be boys!”
“A thousand million Fadden’s done me?—
Didn’t know I had it on me!”
What the people think is news,
And they’re welcome to their views,
Though few will lose their beauty sleep
When profiteering merchants weep;
But when a Premier wants to jam
A fare increase on rail and tram,
Manoeuvring to put it over
Under the Federal Budget’s cover,
Then runs to swell the public cry
That Fadden’s pushing prices high,
The strongest stomach must demur:
“Is this the Premier James McGirr
Who started prices’ upward trek
By lowering the working week?
He’s like a child who makes a mess
All over her new party dress,
And, while her parents mop it up,
Shakes angrily her empty cup.
This, full-grown Premiers should not do —
It makes us want to vomit, too.”

“Clooter”: Whatever others may think,
the members of the South Australian
branch of the Liquor Trades Employees’
Union don’t agree that wine and women
go together, though they say nothing
about song. About 250 of them went on
strike against an award providing for the
employment of women in wineries, hold-
ing, on “moral grounds,” that wineries
are no place for women. The astonished
Winemakers’ Association remarked that
women were employed in wineries in other
States and there was no evidence that it
caused immorality. This seems to cast
some sort of a doubt on the character of
South Australian women, though whether
the strikers see it that way is another
matter.

“Blue Peter”: From Khartoum comes
news of what promises to be one of the
most unusual claims on record. The
White Nile has several small islands on
which crops have been successfully grown
for years. The massive railway bridge at
Omdurman spans one of these islands,
and farmers are claiming compensation
for land rendered unsuitable for crops
through being almost permanently in the
shadow of the bridge. When last heard
of lawyers were busy inspecting the
shadow.

“Lyle”; Selling a wife? The case
recorded in the J. K. Moir collection of
Australiana (B. 29/ 8 / ’5l) was not unique
in Australia. In 1811 a resident of
Windsor (N.S.W.) led his wife, with her
consent, into the streets of the town, with
a halter round her neck, and offered her
for sale. She brought £l6 and he brought
50 lashes and three months’ hard labor
in irons. The woman was sent to New-
castle penal settlement, and the buyer
lost his money. Police-superintendent
Martin Brennan described in his Remini-
scences a wife-sale he witnessed at Crown
Flat, when serving on the Araluen gold-
field in the ’sixties, A “dissipated miner”
sold his wife and children to the highest
bidder, “The woman,” says Brennan,
“was young and good-looking, and was
fortunate to fall into the hands of one
who treated herself and her children well
during the years they were under my
observation.” No mention was made of
any proceedings being taken against the
wife-seller.

“W.M.H.”; Discovery of a new type
of light-bulb which uses no electricity
should interest blackout-weary Sydney-
siders, A glow is produced by reaction
between mercury and phosphorescent
substances. The bulb lights up when
shaken and will bum indefinitely so long
as the magic mixture is agitated. Well,
there wouldn’t be any shortage of agita-
tion.

“Ex-C.G.”: A repair gang discovered a
forgotten basement under Melbourne
Parliament House the other day, almost
full of a lot of forgotten junk, including
“ Stupid , forgetting my mirror , Colonel!”
two plaster lions originally intended to
adorn the abutments which flank the steps
from Spring-street and a plaque which
seems to symbolise Victoria’s separation
from N.S.W., the 100th anniversary of
which Vic. is celebrating this year. What
doesn’t seem to have been discovered is
the notorious mace, which disappeared
in the long ago, was allegedly discovered
in a bawdy house in Little Lon., became
the centre of scandalised discussion for
some years and then apparently vanished
altogether.
“Cauboy”: My long-held belief —partly
due to the propaganda of Wirth’s Circus
and partly to a statement in one of D. H.
Lawrence’s poems that “the elephant is
slow to mate” —that the pachyderms live
to a great age has been shattered by an
advertisement in the London “Times”
offering a 20-year-old jumbo for sale as
being too elderly for the circus business.
I once wrote a fanciful par. for The
Bulletin in which I represented Suraj ah
Dowlah as having ridden to school on
the back of Wirth’s Queenie, but that is
apparently all wrong. The greatest age
that an elephant attains to is round about
40, and most of them are in the sere and
yellow at 30. Shaw didn’t cease to think
at 94, but an elephant, it appears, ceases
to think at 20. That is the reason why
the owner of the London specimen wants
to get rid of his 20-year-old beast —it is
too old to learn new tricks. She is offered
for sale as a pet, but a pet which eats
one hundredweight of hay a day is likely
to become as hated as my friend’s Great
Dane, which needs as much meat in a
day as the owner’s family can afford in
a week,

“Sebak”: In N.S.W. regulations forbid
a boxer to engage in a contest without
(a) police supervision, (b) a medical
certificate. The law is well-inten-
tioned, but I recall a time when I
thought a slight relaxation could have
been allowed. At our small-town stadium
two boys had just entered the ring for a
prelim, when the police-sergeant called
an official; he had no certificate for one
of the boxers. The lad’s trainer explained
that his charge had fought there the
previous week and he hadn’t thought
another certificate necessary. It was
necessary. Exit the contestant to be
examined. The other boy, keyed up for
his first fight, sat in his corner fidgeting,
looking out at the restless crowd and
generally working himself up to a blue
funk. After a long, long wait it was
announced that the doctor had left the
building, and the unexamined boxer had
gone to the surgery —about 10 minutes’
walk away. The bout finally came on
half an hour later. But it wasn’t the
pasting I got that has remained in my
memory all these years: it was that dread-
ful wait.

“Tom”: Besides being Jubilee Year of
the Commonwealth, 1951 is the centenary
year of the pillar-box. Pioneered by an
official of the British Post Office, novelist
Anthony Trollope, in 1851, the pillar-box
has shown substantial variation in pattern
in its century of existence. The earliest
type was hexagonal, and there was no
standard color. Then came square and
round wooden boxes. Later still, highly
ornamental ones were built. There were
19th-century examples in the form of
fluted classical columns. Some early
boxes could take parcels as well as letters.
Red was approved “as a special distin-
guishing color” by the British Postmaster-
General in 1884. Queen Victoria is
thought to have been responsible for that
color becoming standard.

“W.P.T.”: A swaggie called Rags,
who had been tramping about the
N.S.W. South Coast for many years,
was boiling his billy one morning
when a motorist stopped and asked
him if he had ever heard of a
Thomas Mclntyre thereabouts. “Never
heard of him,” replied Rags, “and I
reckon I know everyone for fifty miles
around.” “Well, I’ll push on,” said the
stranger. “I represent a legal firm, and
there are several thousand pounds wait-
ing for him, but if I can't locate him,
well, it’s just too bad.” Some hours later
Rags was tramping along the road when
he dropped the swag and jumped in the
air as if he had been bitten by a death-
adder. “Gripes, I’m Thomas Mclntyre,
he said to himself, “but nobody’s called
me it for thirty years.” It took
him a while to find the legal cove, but
in the end he got the money all right.
Rags continued as a swagman, but a
well-fed and well-clad one with always
a helping hand for less fortunate
travellers.

“Nunk”: I had asked a Sydney shop
to look me out a list of spare parts for
a model-construction set, and on dropping
in to collect found the salesman apolo-
getic: “I’ve got it half done,” he said,
“but I’ve had to stop to fix up a £lOO
lay-by of toys.” Must have been for a
bricklayer—it’s nice to think someone s
got money.
* * * *
“Bass”: Westralian trains evoke de-
rision from visitors from more favored
parts, but they’ll meet you in some un-
expected ways. Recently at 8.15 a.m. a
man dashed up to a suburban ticket-
office and gasped “Has the ten-past gone
yet?” “It’s been cancelled this morn-
ing,” the clerk told him. “But,” he added
as the bloke started to rave, “If you hang
on a few minutes you’ll catch the eight
o’clock. It ought to be here any time
now.”
* * * *
“Doric”: Happened to be in Avignon
(France) on a fete-day and expressed to
the hotel porter my enjoyment of the
procession of peasants in their native
costumes. “Ah, but you wait until after
lunch,” he said. “At two o’clock, five
wild bulls are to be let loose in the streets
—it will be very droll!” Luckily my
train for Paris left at noon.
* * * *
“The Missus”: Starting to write a par.,
I put “My former Lighthorseman
husband” ; then Joe’s ghost came to stare
over my shoulder and I hastily altered it
to “My husband, a former Lighthorse-
man.” Joe came from Spain and had a
working knowledge of English. One day
he asked me if I’d ever been to Queens-
land, and I replied “Oh, yes. I lived there
for a few years when I was first married.”
There was a long silence while he chewed
that over, and then he ventured, “I
thoughta this was your firsta husban’.
So you been widow, eh?” Sorting him
out was quite a task and, though he’s
been dead for years, Joe still does more
to keep my prose from having a double
meaning than all the schoolmistresses who
tried to do that for me.

“X.S.”: Russell-street issued its usual
warning to the public to be careful of
the con, men who descend on Melbourne
each year during Show week. They
should put a police guard on Captain
Cook’s cottage in the Fitzroy Gardens,
especially in these days of housing short-
age. It was once sold to a man from
the country who was told that the navi-
gator lived there when he was in Aus-
tralia and that Sir Joseph Banks laid out
the garden. .
* * * *
“Mickerman”: To “Jaw-harp v. Jew’s-
harp” (B. 29/ 8/ ’5l) and the frequently-
mentioned misuse of “decimate” I would
add “salvo.” In sailing days a warship
would save half a broadside of muzzle-
loaders so that while half the guns were
run in and reloaded, a long period during
which the slowly-manoeuvring ship was
still liable to take it from the opposition,
she would still be able to fire. Nowadays,
“salvo” means that everything you’ve got
is being thrown at the enemy. A group-
ing of words that has always puzzled me,
both for usage and origin, is “Now
then.” Now, then, what does it mean?
A DEPLORABLE TENDENCY.
“Too many novelists, when one of their characters
gets bad news, put a glass of spirituous liquor in his
hand, thus encouraging drinking habits among their
readers. In any case this simply perpetuates a
canard; real people find a cup of tea superior as a
restorative.” —Temperance lecturer.
See Gaylord Swift, the hero of the book,
Handsome of look.
Clean-limbed (he simply must be that, of
course,
Seeing it’s fiction),
With many a wave in his well-varnished hair,
So debonair
Of manner. Deep his voice; he has, perforce,
A perfect diction.
And yet this charming overall effect
May well be wrecked
When by a “blow of Fate” (you know the
kind)
He’s dominoed. A
Character-weakness shows up stark and grim
Then, when to him
Is handed—and it’s ne’er, you’ll note,
declined —
A ’skee-and-soda.
You’d say the cove who earns a modest crust
By writing, must
Know his world better than to loosely think
The man knocked bandy
By some misfortune seeks to dull its pain,
To ease the strain
(Thereby acknowledging he’s just a gink),
By “going” the brandy.
At Flemington and Randwick you’ll observe
Men with real nerve.
I don’t mean bookies, though they’ve got a
lot —
Those odds they slaughter!—
But punters who, on doing in their shirts
On various “certs”
Seek kindly balm, not in the fiery tot,
But lolly-water.
And he whose wife has robbed the old dak
chest,
And flown the nest —
Does he his freedom celebrate by tip-
ping the old rum-bottle?
Nay, nay! He simply to the kitchen hies
And there applies
The cup that cheers unto his bone-dry lip,
His cracking throttle.
Why is it the romantic novelist
Will still persist
In filling his shocked character with grog
To dramatise him?
Perhaps there is a reason for it: viz.,
To get more biz.
Distillers, sensing ads. in dialogue,
Now subsidise him!

ABORIGINALITIES
“Mac Fergus”: They know how to
breed them in the Cunnamulla (Q.)
country to take to the stock-routes as
young drovers. Leslie Capewell, 13, is a
boss-drover with a complete plant. He
delivered a mob of 190 bullocks at this
station, and we last sighted him heading
for the Bollon side to lift a mob of sheep
for delivery at Orange (N.S.W.). And he’s
the boss all right; he summarily sacked
a couple of his men. “No good to me,”
he said, “They’re only ‘yikes.’ I’d rather
have a couple of real old blokes about
30.”

“Waddlin’ Willie”: There’s a lake down
in Victoria’s rich western district called
Sullen Merri which holds a fish mystery
to which even the Director of Fisheries
(A. Dunbavin Butcher) can offer no
solution. Four years ago thousands of
young brown trout yearlings were liber-
ated ; for three successive years anglers
cast their lines but caught no fish. To
disprove claims that the fish were dead
Mr. Butcher took a boat out and cast a
net, and got plenty of big brown trout
Last year, as an experiment, he released
thousands of rainbow trout yearlings.
Result: This year thousands of trout are
being caught but they’re all rainbows.
The browns just won’t bite. Any reason?
* * * *
“Bamekaw”: The quiz contestant was
piling up points in the section on animal
life, until he was asked why should bee-
hives be placed at the foot rather than
at the top of a hill. Good reasons, such
as the shelter afforded against prevailing
winds, or the lusher vegetation on the
flats, seemed to be in order, but the
answer, which eluded him and astonished
me, was that the homing bee with laden
pollen-bags finds it harder to fly uphill
If the insect were a foot-slogger I could
understand it, but I had some hazy idea
that a winged creature, by keeping parallel
to an upward slope, found the extra
gravitational pull of little account. But
then I’m no scientist; neither, apparently,
are the countless wild bees who seem to
wilfully select the tallest tree in the pad-
dock as the ideal spot for a home. Or
perhaps such inaccessibility, serving as
a protection against honey-seeking
enemies, makes the extra effort of an
upward flight worth while.
* * * *
“Hoppy”: Recent Abo. pars on
chimney-stacks have aroused discussion
at Mt. Isa mine, where the 300-footer of
concrete has had its innards lined
with special imported bricks from
keel to truck. When we reached
top, some movement was experienced
when the stage was not chocked against
the walls, although the makers claimed
the black-and-silver landmark should
sway a bare 2in. in a force-eight blow.
Incidentally, on the day the lining was
being finished, a staff bloke appeared
through the hole in the platform on an
inspection tour, and was enlisted i; n
impromptu ceremony of the laying o he
last brick amid cheery comments of the
crew, who felt relieved the tough job was
over. 5 However, the stack’s official history
was not to begin until the following day,
when the boss arrived in a bit of a mod,
announcing, “Bert, get into that bucket
and up to the top, me boy. You’re to
yank out that last brick, ’cos the heads
are all coming soon, and —no smart com-
ments —they’re going to relay that brick
properly.”

“Wippegong”: It’s been a bit lone-
some in the garden today. The first glad
i ush of spring weeds being upon me,
instead of scratching about with spade
and rake as usual I borrowed a rotary-
hoe and stirred the soil in earnest —and
not one of my feathered cobbers would
come near me. The little hen flame-robin
“ Whacko , there it is, Sis!”
wnose beady black eyes are usually
within a yard or so of my boots
took one look from the fence and bolted ;
the pee wees deserted to my rival, Judd,
who was planting spuds ; the maggies,
who are nesting, took a good look at the
stuttering intruder, reckoned it couldn’t
fly or climb, and resumed their dispersal
of crows and kids ; Billy the wag. spent
the whole day with the cow, and even the
boy’s bantam and her clutch only came
on to the cultivation when I left it. I
wonder if the plough-following birds
are adapting themselves to the mechanical
age the way horses had to on the road?
It's a long time since I trudged behind
a mouldboard, the only sounds the
creaking of harness and the cpulter cut-
ting the sod, and behind me a feathered
train of wondrous diversity ; and both
the bays 1 drove, if on the road and a
car came along, would rear hysterically
and paw as though trying to scramble
for safety up some invisible tree. But
they got used to cars, and even to motor-
bikes ; so maybe when most of the
mouldboards are rusting by the fences
the rural fowl will have learnt to use their
ears as much as their eyes to find where
tupker is being turned up. Noise is one
of the prices we have to pay for
progress ; I wonder if any of the birds,
“They’re shootin'—pull yer head in!"
too, will wonder if it’s always worth the
price?
* * * *
“Laetitia”: Bathurst and Melville
Islanders may be the only Australian
natives to erect totem poles over their
dead (B. 12/9/’5l), but they certainly
aren’t alone in raising memorials over the
resting-place of the departed. Torres
Straits Binghi goes the whole hog in the
matter of monumental masonry, his
medium being a mixture of lime and
pulverised-and-burned coral, which, when
whitewashed, presents at a distance all
the appearance of marble. Each mourner
is his own craftsman, and an inherent
modelling genius is given full play, with
a biblical motif prominent in most
designs. Custom forbids a widower’s re-
marriage before he has erected a head-
stone to his late wife, hence the mushroom
appearance of a tombstone often
indicates, not an excess of grief, but an
interest in a sable successor. The in-
scriptions on the headstones are some-
times used for propaganda, as witness
the case of Rau, for long a factotum at
the Torres Straits district hospital, who
sought officialdom’s permission to in-
scribe on a deceased relative’s tomb the
touching message: “Erected by his loving
cousin-brother Rau, who has been a good
and faithful servant of the Thursday
Island hospital for 20 years.”

“Old-timer”: Old Jimmy was searching
the bends for elbows —redgum limbs
with right-angle turns which could be
adzed down to make boat foundations —
and ran into young Walker, “What y’
want t’ muck about with them for?” the
youngster sneered. “Y’ got to cut down
the limb, then saw both ends off, then
chip away at it —all that work when y’
could go inter Mildoora an’ buy some o’
them light metal brackets out of aero-
planes at the disposals stores an’ there’s
y’r elbows.” Jimmy eyed him silently,
then grunted “So-long,” unshipped his
oars and paddled inexorably away. Later,
as he helped himself from my billy, he
remarked in a brooding sort of way, “Ran
inter young Walker near the Cliffs. Know
him? Full of ideas. Get things done,
that’s him. Blimey, some o’ these young
fellers doan’ know they’re alive.
Reckoned I oughter buy some o’ that iron
stuff f’r elbows. Quicker, he says. Save
work, says he. ’Course it’d save work ;
doan’ 1 know that!” He imbibed some
tea. “Who wants t’ save work?” he
went on. “Strike me, a bloke goes
paddlin’ along the bends an’ up the
reaches, movin’ inter cricks an’ back inter
the river, lookin’ f’r elbows an’ seein’ all
sorts o’ things an’ thinkin’ things y’
couldn’t see or think of if y’ went inter
a store an’ out again. His way I’d have
me elbows in twenty minutes ; my way
it’ll take a fortnight t’ get ’em.” He
stared out at the darkening river, a small
glow on his leathery dial, and I could
see what young Walker was missing with
his hurry and short-cuts.

“Emjai”: I’m “Betcha’s” way (B.
29/8/’5l) in his debunking of the birds.
The blackbird lauded by the poets for
his gloating chortle in the small hours is
the worst offender of all, for he won't
scare, is multiplying like the sparrows,
and all fruits, berries and tomatoes fall
victims to his yellow bill. He has no
beauty, and his usefulness has been con-
fined to his appearing in a dubious pie for
a nursery rhyme. The crows, eagles,
hawks and parrots may rank with the*
bushrangers and pirates, but the black-
birds are the sneak-thieves, pickpockets
and con.-men that have wormed their
way, with a few siren notes, into the
mushy affections of poets and old maids.

“Dolmetcher”; Give the Maori his due,
he’s pretty quick off the mark for thinking
up a good excuse. Faced with the task
of explaining how the wallet of a
fellow-passenger on a bus happened
to get transferred from his hip-pocket to
Hori’s, he made a valiant attempt. “It’s
te rheumatism, eh, boss,” he informed
the sceptical magistrate. This bringing
no immediate response, Hori expanded
the theme. “Yes, boss, for years 1 suffer
te rheumatism and te doctors can’t help.
Tiss time on te bus I get a bad twinge,
eh, and my hand it end up in the pakeha’s
pocket.” “Sounds reasonable,” quoth
the Beak. “But I’m still waiting to hear
how the wallet got into your pocket.”
“Aw, just another twinge, eh”; and see-
ing that the magistrate wasn’t reacting
too benignly, Hori added, “and te wallet
was clamped in te fist, so I tink I’d better
put te hand in te pocket before I hit te
pakeha with another twinge, boss.” “Well,
why didn’t you ask the pakeha to take
his wallet out of your hand first?” Hori
was nonplussed for about 10 seconds, and
then made a last desperate gamble.
, “Well, you see, boss, no time.” “No
j time?” queried his Worship. “No time,”
reiterated Hori sadly. “You see, I got to
get off te bus at te next stop, and, by
korry, when I get home it take the
wahine a whole hour to massage te
fingers from te wallet, eh!”

“Solitude”: We were nearing our mid-
day camp. “Y* know, Sol,” mused
Seventyfiver, his eyes on the scrub where
a wallaby had disappeared, “the bush
animals in this country think o’ nothin’
but runnin’ away. Reckon they’re built
for it. Not like some places y’ read
about, where tigers is made right V tear
a man t’ bits, an’ bears crushes his bones.
Ours just run.” “Aw, I dunno,” I
parried. “A Too can put up a decent
scrap.” “Only the big’ns, Sol,” came his
argument. “An’ mostly only when he’s
pushed. Y’ got t’ admit his feet’s made
really f’r travellin’ fast. A dingo’ll bite,
too, if he’s cornered, but you uncorner
’im an’ he’ll
run like hell”
We reached
our tucker-
site and
swung down.
“No, our
livestock
ain’t built
for stoush,”
Seventyfiver
resumed, as
he put a match to some sticks and filled
the billy. “They don’t make no attack ”
“What about a flea, or a wasp, or a bull-
ant?” “Them things is diff’rent,” came
the indignant snort. “A inseck never was
nothin’ but a plain nark. But you take
animals. A hare, a wallaby, or a flying-
squirrel—cripes, they’re helpless as a
flamin’ rabbit. Yair, or a wombat even,”
he continued, unstrapping the tucker.
“A wombat’s built strong, but all c
wants is t’ run an’ hide hisself. The
trouble is our animals ’ye got nothin’
much t’ fight with. No line o’ defence,
y’ might say; an’ if a bloke goes about

cise moment the old cove sat on the

“Colonial Cove”: While “Mia-mia
was the abo. term for a temporary
dwelling pf boughs and leaves in south-
east Victoria, on the south-western
portion of the continent the native called
his temporary dwelling both a “wurbe
and a “gunya.” “Mia,” by direct
evidence, means in abo. language ot
Westralia a cave or a hole in the ground.
Hence the “Wilgie-mia,” that large
excavation in the Weld Range on the
Murchison goldfields (W.A.), where in
digging out wilgie (red ochre) for un-
numbered years the aboriginals have
sunk so deep that artificial lighting is
necessary to work the various faces.
Again, when copper was, around the
’seventies, worked on the Geraldine held
out from Geraldton, the abos were quicK
to name the hole in the ground Moneyj
Mia —to their minds the hole from which
the metal for the making of nenmes
came.
TURN TO THE TREES.
Turn to the trees at noon,
Pillars of living peace,
That soar above all hates
Hissing from human geese.
Here is the sky’s blue joy
In the leaves’ tracery,
Song’s home, and wonder’s grace,
A green serenity.
Beyond the rout and thrum,
1 drink the silent force
Welling through timeless earth,
Unseen, from its deep source.
As the air chills at eve,
And the lone trees grow cold,
I go to men's loud hives.
Whatever stings they hold;
Return to trafficking,
To laughter, work, desire,
To the warm hands of love,
To friendship by the lire.
Hermits are ghosts, and I
Must shoulder life's decrees;
Yet still at noon I seek
Communion with the trees.
My being's sun fulfils
Circuit of east and west,
Sharing men’s hardihood,
Joining with earth in zest.

“Wipp.”; Young Peterson has added
to his knowledge, though in a manner
disappointing to himself. Taking a look
round the place in winter we reckoned
we could fit in a couple of dozen more
shrubs, so off went the order, ensuring
the filling of the gaps and incidentally
acquiring merit on our behalf with the
Jubilee Tree-Planting Committee. When
the big bundle came from the nursery
we all downed tools except the painters,
who were then busy on the roof, and
lifted out the little trees, calling their
names, passing judgment on their con-
dition and generally behaving in the
irresponsible manner expected from
garden cranks ; when suddenly, for no
reason then apparent, young Peterson
dropped his brush, slid down the ladder
and joined us, expectation written all over
him. He looked at the array by the wall,
peered into the parcel, shifted some
papers with his foot and sniffed round
like a pup that had mislaid a bone. He
watched each horticulturist in turn, then
edged over and muttered “Where’s the
beer?” “No beer, Pete,” we told him,
“just plants this time” ; and with a grunt
he was up the ladder again. Straightened
the mystery out later, and now he knows
not only that there is such a tree as
liquidamber, but that slang can be
ambiguous.

H. A. Lindsay: All life reproduces by
egg-cells, and in the chromosomes of every
such cell are the genes, which govern
inherited characteristics. They determine
such diverse factors as the ability of some
seeds to withstand great extremes of
temperature, the instincts of animals and
the hair-structure, color of eyes and
build of individual human beings. Genes
cannot be preserved in specimen bottles ;
they can be kept in existence
only by preserving the plant,
the bird or the animal to
which they belong. When
any species becomes extinct,
its genes are lost with it and
nothing which the wit of
man can devise will ever
restore them to the world.
They are, in fact, creation’s
greatest treasures ; they con-
fer the ability to resist
disease, to live in a severe
climate and, in some
animals, the instinct to, say,
root under the snow to
obtain fodder or to seek
shelter when bad weather
threatens. Familiar ex-
amples are our modern
rust-resisting strains of
wheat, bred by crossing
this domesticated plant with
a wild grass, and the im-
munity of the zebu breed of
cattle to tick-fever. No-
body can say which par-
ticular genes may be needed
by plant- and animal-
breeders ; the only answer
to the problem is to
preserve all living things in
case their genes may be
needed some day. Present-
day American scientists no
longer state that wild-life
sanctuaries are needed in
order to preserve species of
plants and animals for pos-
terity, but in order to
preserve through them “those
precious, irreplaceable wild
genes whose potential
value to mankind is in-
calculable.” Hence those
who are striving to
preserve the flora and fauna of
Australia are conserving genes which
may some day aid in the work of
making additional areas of the earth’s
surface habitable and productive. It is
wrong to think that the extinction of some
plant, animal or bird is of small account
because it has no apparent economic
value; every such loss should instead be
regarded as a tragedy, for with its passing
the world loses, in its genes, something
which can never be regained.
“Blime”: Buff’s nag was as familiar
at the hitching-rack on Saturday after-
noons as Buff was at. the bar. The old
bloke drank late into the night, and it
was always the job of the last-goers to
shove him into his saddle and turn him
towards home—the nag knew the rest.
Then the boys at the pub got tired of
such uninteresting procedure, and tried
reversing Buff’s saddle. It didn’t fit so
well rear on, but they strapped it tight
and waited. Came time for the old bloke
to move off, and they shoved him aboard,
giving him the loose end of the crupper,
still on the nag’s
tail, in lieu of
reins. Buff started
home backwards.
In the know,
Robbie dropped in
the following
morning to see if
the inebriated one
had arrived safely.
He found him on
the woodheap, holding his head. “Get
home all right last night, Buff?” he
asked tentatively. “Yair, got home,”
came the reply. “She wus a snorter
though, weren’t she? Gripes, I never
seen such a dark night as that’n.” He
paused to shake his head wonderingly.
“Why, d’ y’ know,” he continued, “even
stretched along the nag’s neck an’ starin’
f’r half a mile solid, well, damn it, I still
couldn’t see the moke’s ears 1 ”

“Nakh”: A neighbor put her cow in
calf across the river for agistment. She
was amazed one morning to see an
animal standing on her doorstep. It was
a newborn calf which, immediately it
w'as born, had apparently left its mother
and swum across the river.
* * * *
“Apple Isle”: A boss I once had
would be just the bloke to fix those
magpies that unwind the telephone tie-
wires (B. 12/9/’5l). We were on a job
where the bare copper cables of a high-
tension line had to be connected to a
half-inch copper-rod at the terminal
tower. This was to be done with cast-
copper clamps. He told us that the clamps
were to be screwed to the rod, then drilled
and pinned, and then soldered! My mate
said “And will we tie ’em on with string,
too?” But that was when the trump
was safely out of hearing.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”; Something had started
us talking about music, and from that
we got to the yarn of Ulysses and the
sirens (with impolite variations) and from
“Put ’em down, and your skirt'll act
as a parachute!”
there to mermaids. “It’s a funny thing,”
I said, “how most of us sort of want
mermaids to be true, though I’m blowed
if I can see anything much good in a girl
with a fish’s tail instead of legs.” “Aw,
I dunno,” Mat commented. “Perhaps if
there was a few of ’em about more blokes
like me’d get married.” “What!” “Too
right. I wouldn’t mind havin’ a missus
y’ could dump in a waterhole whenever
y’ wanted t’ blow off for a while. She’d
hafter stay in the bloomin’ water until y’
got back an’ it wouldn’t be no good her
goin’ crook, ’cos a man could just walk
away again an’ leave her there. Gripes! ”
he concluded, enthralled with his vision.
It was the only time I ever saw him
starry-eyed over the prospect of matri-
mony.
* * * *
“M.S ”: Those blokes lifting the cattle
from the Roma yards (B. 5/9/’5l) remind
me of the time Tally went after the dingo
in old Thompson’s. The warrigal had
“First game of the season, and you haven't got your eye in yet, eh?"
killed a number of sheep, and Thompson
was hopping mad. “Same dog,” he
bawled. “Kills with the same throat-hold.
Anybody getting him is on twenty quid.”
(In those days 20 quid meant 20 quid.)
There were baits and traps out and blokes
riding the bush, but, as Tally said, this
wasn’t the sort of dingo to be caught like
that. The job needed brains ; and Tally
prided himself in that line. He looked
the area over carefully, built a small
railed yard in a lonely gully, and sought
Thompson. “Want you to shift all the
sheep from that paddock, except a dozen
to put in me yard,” he told him. “And
I’ll need about six men with rifles, for
an all-night sitting.” He posted his men
carefully, one on the ridge west of the
yard, one in a clump of scrub 100 yards
above, one in a hollow stump due east,
and so On, All night they watched.
“This’s about the time he’ll come,”
whispered Tally, crawling to his neighbor’s
position just before dawn. “Signal round
the line to make sure everybody’s awake.”
Slowly the hour passed. Tally peering
right and left as the smudge of light
spread on the horizon. At full light he
rose and shook his head, then, calling the
others, made for the yard. There he
found five of the decoy sheep with their
throats torn out.
* * * *
“R.T.N.”: Any long-distance drover
can tell you that a man can beat a horse
over a long journey. The late Duncan
Livingstone told me that when he and
his friend, T. Paltridge, set out from Mt.
Gambier (S.A.) to go to St. George
(S.Q.), where they acquired large pastoral
holdings, the first night out they camped
with a bagman who told them he was
going to the Queensland canefields. In
the morning they told him to put his
swag in the trap and they would give him
a lift to St. George, as they had four fat
horses. He declined, saying he was in a
hurry. At Broken Hill he was hard
behind them ; at Bourke he was a week
ahead ; and at St. George he was so far
in the lead that his passing through was
ancient history.
* * * *
“8.A.K.”; The magpies that nest in the
big box across the paddock have, at
various times, knocked my hat off, clicked
their beaks a quarter of an inch from my
ear, and generally startled the daylights
out of me ; but I’ve always seen their
point of view. I’ve even accepted their
one-sided arrangement that I have no
right to approach within 100 yards of
their home, but they can come scrounging
right up to my back door. In their latest
stunt, however, they are dealing with a
sterner character. The wife has installed
a dozen potential Christmas dinners in a
fowl-pen —Orpington chicks about a
month old. Although the pen is on
neutral ground beyond the deadline that
Maggie and Jacko drew, the chicks’ lives
have become a series of panic dashes into
the air-raid shelters as the black-and-
white dive-bombers . come swooping
down. Sometimes the enemy even lands
in the pen and abuses the skulkers from
the verge of the safety zone ; all of which
has embittered a normally most tender-
hearted spouse and caused her to hint
darkly about the shotgun. I try to point
out that magpies don’t eat chickens;
that if murder was their intention it
could have been committed long before
this, but she trumps me with: “Then
what are they trying to do?” I don’t
know; but I wish they’d stop doing it —
before I’m nagged into doing a regret-
table action.

“Sebak”: Recently heard three self-
rated authorities on snakes debating the
old one about wounded snakes biting
themselves. Two claimed to have seen
it, but disagreed as to the motive ; one
pushing the theory that the wriggler does
it to end his suffering, the other contend-
ing that a snake is immune to its own
poison and merely bites itself in reptilian
temper. The third debater swore he’d
killed hundreds and never seen one bite
itself; however, he conceded that he
always struck high up within a foot of
the head, which might defeat Joe’s
intentions. Without claiming to know
the answer, I recall a certain slowworm
(legless lizard). About 18in. long, it could
easily have been mistaken for a young
brown sn a k e—until the stick fell.
Immediately the thin body broke at the
point of impact, the two pieces writhing
on end. One contortion twisted the
bigger piece into a knot; instantly the
small mouth bit savagely at the raw but
bloodless other end protruding from the
tangle. As slowworms are non-venomous
the suicide theory is non-suited. Anger
looks to be the only explanation.

“Harbel”; It was a stiff climb, but a
very pleasant one, up this South Coast
(N.S.W.) mountain - range, where,
hundreds of feet above sea-level, we came
on a faint track that wove between the
columns of tree-trunks. Suddenly we
were standing
on the verge
of a small
clearing.
Four tree-
trunks had
been laid on
the ground to
form a
square about
24ft. across.
Obviously the logs had been there many
years. I thought of the cleared paddock
at the foot of the mountain and the utter
impossibility of anyone reaching this
spot unseen, then found myself thinking
of the days when bareknuckle fights were
fought in secret; perhaps this had been
the scene of—l got no further; the
tobacco- and cigarette-packets belonged
to current times. There had been
rumors of clandestine cockfights, but
neither feathers nor chook’s footprints
were visible in the trampled dust. A
flapper in the party spoke up: “Oh, isn’t
that nice? I saw something just like this
on the pictures last Saturday. These
people in this qut-of-the-way mountain
place used to hold church meetings sit-
ting on logs in the forest just like this.”
“Yair,” grinned the party’s realist.
“I guarantee they’re parked all around
these logs every Sunday morning, and I
bet they all raise their eyes towards
heaven, then bow their heads.”
TREE-TOMATOES.
Between their shieldlike leaves the tree-tomatoes
Hang on their slender stalks,
They are red, they shine
Secretly, suggesting something of evil:
The evil of too much beauty in the perfect line
From stalk to the tip of the fruit.
I have crawled under the trees
And touched their very smooth
Rinds, felt color before I picked.
I have bitten them, sensation on the tooth
And tongue is like a taste not known before:
The flavor of a kiss,
Lip-feel made manifest
By very aloof and recondite fruits
Hanging so still —not understanding rest.
Tree-tomatoes cannot know anything of anything
Yet —“Knowledge is love”
Is my creed and belief,
And I have known this most clearly
Seeing a pointed fruit hidden under its leaf.

The remarkable and very profitable
development of this robust 17-year-old
reflects the energy and foresight of the
management and the rapid post-war
growth and inflationary expansion of the
Australian economy. Paid capital
advanced from £170,000 in 1935 to
£1,730,333 at June 30 last by par and
bonus issues, shareholders received divs.
averaging 12.5 p.c. over the same period,
and when the books last closed visible
free reserves totalled £858,641.
Outstanding features last term were (1)
Rapid expansion of the capital account,
(2) erection of a new tyre factory on a
40-acre block near Brisbane, which came
into production ahead of schedule in
December, 1950, and (3) speedy growth
of turnover. The new factory will reduce
freight and overhead and cheapen
and quicken distribution throughout
Queensland and northern N. S. Wales.
To help meet the outlay and finance
expanding turnover, shareholders were
twice called upon to assist. Firstly, in
August, 1950, those on the ord. register
were handed 522,000 f.-p. ss. bonus
shares £130,500), one for four. The
gift was followed by par issues of 51,143
£1 5 p.c. prefs. and 1,305,000 ss. ords.
(£326,520). Then, in May last, a further
3,900,906 new ss. ords. (£975,226) were
also issued at par, and paid to 2s. 6d.
each when the books closed, leaving
£487,613 still to come. Meanwhile,
55,880 ss. employee shares (£13,970) were
issued to the staff—divs. on these shares
are limited to 6 p.c. p.a. All this lifted
issued capital at June 30 last to
£2,217,946, of which £250,000 carries
a cumulative 5 p.c. p.a.
Turnover went up with a rush,
approaching the £8,000,000-mark, the
increase being over 75 p.c., due partly
to lifts in selling-prices and partly to the
growth of demand for car, truck
and bus tyres and the shoeing of tractors
and earth-moving and other heavy
vehicles. The lift in selling-prices
followed rises in wage and other
costs, including the price of raw rubber,
sterling figure for which rose from 2s. to
ss. <&!. and recently dropped to around
4s. a pound.
The cautious board figured net earn-
ings £104,874 stronger at £317,799. That
was after reserving £200,000 against any
shrinkage in stock-values, allowing a
generous £177,132 (up £76,066) for de-
preciation, etc., and setting aside £450,000
(up £172,000) for current and deferred
taxation. The div, was maintained at
14 p.c, on capital employed, and more be-
sides. The final distribution of £117,418
(7} p.c.) included £37,406 payable on
scrip to be issued for purchase of
Beaurepaire Investments, Ltd. So the
£317,799 of profit claimed was enough
to pay Olympic’s own pref.- and
employee-share divs. and show 36.7 p.c.
on average ord. capital as against 38.8,
26.5 and 21.6 p.c. for the three preceding
years.
Completion of the Brisbane factory
and bigger trading at rising prices
again show up in net additions of
£186,624 to freeholds, £249,087 to plant,
£2,366,713 to stocks and £456,297 to
book debts:

To meet the outlay £878,976 of fresh
cash-paid capital was gathered, £1,590,100
was added to the overdraft and £382,108
to the amount coming to sundry creditors,
etc. Stocks appear at cost less a reserve
of £600,000, or 2s. lOd. in the £. The
improvement in the more-or-less liquid
surplus (£1,242,330) was £591,616.
Since the close of accounts all the
£375,000 of issued capital (£50,000 of it
was 7 p.c. pref.) in Beaurepaire Invest-
ments, Ltd., has been bought in exchange
for 1,995,000 Olympic f.-p. ss. ords.
(£498,750). The investment co. owns
two operating subsidiaries in the garage
business in Victoria and S. Aust. It
netted £54,129 for the year to June 30,
1950, and paid 15 p.c. Figures to June
30 last are not available. The deal, which
should be satisfactory to both parties,
will lift paid capital to £2,716,696, on
which pref. and employee divs. and
14 p.c. to the ords. will together call for
about £29,000 more profit than was
claimed last term.
Increased co, and other taxation, credit
restriction and rising costs can be
expected to damp down the relative
earning-power of funds during the current
term, but the figures will benefit from a
full year’s operation of the Brisbane
factory and from earnings of the garage
subsidiaries just taken over.
The market also notes the conservative
statement of profits, and prices the f.-p.
ss. ords. at 20s. to return 3.5 p.c. on :
14 p.c. div. basis. The pound prefs. at
225. 6d. yield 4.4 p.c. On capital as it
now stands net tangible cover is approxi-
mately £l4 6s. prefs. and 6s. 9d. ords.

The buoyancy of turnover and profits
and absorption of Murdochs, Ltd.,
shortly after the close of accounts, are
the main features of the co.’s recent
activities. The group—parent and three
subsidiaries —are vendors of short-term
credit, furniture and furnishings in N. S.
Wales, Victoria and Queensland, Time-
payment contracts and small loans con-
stitute the bulk of the business, followed
by furniture, etc., and cash-orders. Under
economic hot-house conditions, turnover
romped along from nearly £3 million
in 1947 to £6.5 million last term, when the
improvement was over £1.5 million.
A one-for-four bonus-share issue
(£131,662) in October last—paid from
a reserve of £145,330 created by writing
up the book-value of assets —was followed
by a cash issue of 548,591 new 12s. ords.,
one for two, at par (£329,155). Issued
capital at June 30 last was thus lifted to
£1,137,464 in 150,000 £1 10 p.c. prefs.
and 1,645,773 12s. ords,—there was
£27,218 still to come in. On that lot the
pref, div. and 15 p.c. to the ords. would
call for £44,363 less profit than claimed
last term.
After sending £20,000 to the staff fund
(same as previous year), and “making
what is considered by the board sufficient
reserves for taxation, bad debts and cost

were £87,188 stronger at a record
£207,482. That covered pref. require-
ments and 29.1 p.c. on average ord.
capital as against 25.9, 26.4, 23.9, 16.3
and 13.7 p.c. back to 1946. Maintenance
of the 15 p.c. div. was thus a comfortable
matter. Whether allowances for taxation,
etc., were enough to cover the Budget
increase and liability for long-service-
leave, etc., can only be guessed at by
outsiders. However, the board considered
the co.’s position good enough to transfer
£30,000 from an undisclosed stock
reserve into the open window.
Features of the parent’s balance-sheet
were net additions of £659,441 to book
debts and £309,519 to stocks:

The drop of £110,760 in freeholds sug-
gests that properties might have been
transferred to subsidiaries —a number of
suitable retail sites in the three Eastern
States were bought during the year.
Shares in subsidiaries increased by
£145,337 and in other cos. by £214,220.
The growth in cash-paid capital was
£330,772, in the overdraft £402,699 and
in creditors, etc., £217,994. The more-or-
less liquid surplus (£1,225,043) was
£547,101 stronger.
Murdochs, Ltd., whose 12-storied men's
and boys’-wear store faces George- and
Park-streets, Sydney, was taken over on
July 16, 1951. At end July, 1950, paid
capital was £649,324, reserves £42,736 and
goodwill £154,940. C.O.A. bought the
ords. at 255. 6d. each and the prefs. at
20s. each, thus paying £747,795 for net
tangible assets with a book-value of
£537,120 at end July, 1950. The freehold
then figured at £641,049, and is said to
be worth more.
To finance the deal and provide
for expansion, £1,100,000-worth of
4} p.c. first mortgage debentures
were issued early in July last.
Murdoch’s profit for the year to end
July, 1950, was £25,275 (3.4 p.c. on pur-
chase price) as against £37,192 and £41,456
for the two preceding years. With the
addition of furniture retailing, the busi-
ness is expected to “make a very valuable
contribution to profits of the co.”
The tightening of credit for home build-
ing, etc., and the impact of increased
taxation, direct and indirect, upon spend-
ing and saving, and the continued rise in
costs can be expected to react to some
extent upon the relative earning-power
of funds. Still, employment promises to
remain at a satisfactory level, and further
increases in the basic wage are expected,
which mean much as far as the debts
question is concerned. The market sums
up the risks by pricing the co.’s f.-p.
12s. ords. at 30s. 6d. (395. a few months
ago) to return 5.9 p.c. on a 15 p.c. div.
basis. The pound prefs. at 30s. 6d. yield

The buoyancy of last term's net earn-
ings was due to a number of factors,
including increased plant capacity and a
more continuous run of the machines.
For over a decade the co. has enjoyed
sheltered and expanding war and post-
war markets, and the board has seized
the new opportunities thus presented.
Over the last five years substantial addi-
tions and improvements have been made
to premises and plant at the main produc-
tion centre at Flemington (near Sydney),
where ladies’ and men’s underwear,
sportswear and industrial clothing are
turned out from cotton-yarns and
-materials produced on the premises.
The branch factory opened near Brisbane
in 1948 is giving a good account of itself,
and the small Auckland (N.Z.) subsidiary,
set up in 1943, netted £3962 (up £1059)
last term.
To help finance the growth the ords.
have put up £271,875 of fresh capital,
which brought with it £37,500 of share
premiums, since 1947. The last £140,625
was gathered in a one-for-two issue at
par in January, 1951, and was used
mainly to reduce the outside debts and
further expand the main factory premises
and plant, which now includes the co.’s
own generating equipment.
The emphasis has been placed where
it should be, namely upon quality and
style of output, the volume of which—
previously impeded by power-rationing
and blackouts—took a big leap last term.
At the same time new markets were de-
veloped by “forceful sales penetration,”
and turnover shot up by no less than
68 p.c., reaching a record £1,680,000-
odd. The higher costs of raw materials,
labor and distribution were also partly
offset by increased selling-prices.
The record £91,223 (up £56,521) of
profit was written after allowing £37,350
(up £15,435) for depreciation, £7o*ooo (up
£56,342) for taxation, £15,000 for the
new long-service leave liability created
by the McGirr Government, and sending
£6OOO to the staff fund. The £91,223
covered the pref. div. (£2000) and 24.4 p.c.
on average ord. capital as against 13.9,
11.6, 14.6, 14.1 and 13.9 p.c. back to
1946. The distribution, which dropped
from 12} p.c. in 1948 to 10 p.c. for the
two following years, was lifted to 12}
p.c. again, making an average of 11.5 p.c.
over the last 15 years. On capital as it
now stands, the pref. div. and 12} p.c. to
the ords. will call for £36,489 less profit
than shown last term.
A reserve of £150,000 was created by
writing up the book-value of land and
buildings, but exactly what the board
had in mind in this connection is not
mentioned. The bigger trading and rising
prices sent stocks up by £169,887 and
book debts by £98,280. To do this and
slash £108,204 off the overdraft share-
holders put up the fresh capital already
mentioned and £195,245 was added to the
amount coming to sundry creditors, etc.:

Ail epitome
of progress
The 1951 Annual Report of Australian Paper
Manufacturers Ltd. tells a story of a great
industrial adventure . . . the rapid growth of
the Australian paper and pulp industry.
During the last financial year A.P.M.:--
* Produced a record total of pulp, paper
and board.
* Enabled the parent Company, The Aust-
ralasian Paper and Pulp Co. Ltd., to pay
an ordinary dividend of 7%.
* Speeded up its construction programme
rate by 250%.
* Held its prices substantially below the
cost of similar imported products.
* Planted more than 2 million pine trees
as part of future pulpwood supplies.
® Enjoyed a year of industrial harmony
in partnership with its employees.
A.P.M/s existing mills throughout Australia are being ex-
panded greatly, to add another 40,000 tons of pulp and
100,000 tons a year of paper and cardboard capacity to
existing plant.
A.P.M. thanks all those who have contributed to its progress.

more -or - less liquid surplus
(£260,809) was £165,506.
Until more is known about the
nature and terms of cotton-
textile imports from Japan, it is
difficult to say to what extent,
if any, the co. is likely to be
affected on that account. The
possibility of local consumer re-
sistance, owing to rising costs
and prices and the stinging in-
creases in taxation just an-
nounced by the Treasurer, is a
factor not to be disregarded.
However, there was a wide
margin between last term’s earn-
ings and distributions, and de-
fence orders should help cushion
any jolt to sales in the civilian
sector of the market.
At 10s. (11s. Id. a month or
so ago) the ss. ords. return 5 p.c.
on a p.c. div. basis. The

Pioneer Scheelite, N.L.
Attracted by the high price of
wolfram and scheelite, this co.
has just been launched in Adel-
aide to acquire options and
leases over tungsten ore deposits,
covering some 110 acres, held
by Imperial Gold Mines, Ltd.,
near Hatches Creek, on the
Kurundi field, Centralia.
Nominal capital is £200,000 in
ss. shares, of which 125,000 paids,
together with £23,000 cash, go
to the vendors (R. McKenzie and
A. Crespan and Imperial Gold)
for leases, plant, etc., 450,000
contribs. are offered for cash to
those on the Imperial co.’s
register at July 28 last, and
200,000 contribs. (underwritten)
are available for public subscrip-
tion, payable 2s. application and
allotment, Is. in Jan. and an-
other Is. in April, 1952, leaving
Is. at call. The remaining 25,000
shares are in pickle.
The co. will thus kick off with
an issued capital of £193,750, of
which purchase price represents
£54,250; preliminary exes, are
estimated at £5542, thus leaving
an immediate working capital of
£36,458, to be supplemented by
calls totalling £65,000 in January
and April next. The lastmen-
tioned amount is the estimated
cost of additional plant, etc., and
of sinking a new inclined shaft.
Two shoots, widths 13|in. and
18in., have been developed to
depths of 120 ft. and 135 ft, re-
spectively. Above these levels
the mine is practically worked
out, and is now waterlogged
below 85ft. A drill-hole, put
down by the Mineral Resources
Survey in 1946, intersected No.
2 lode at 300 ft. from the surface,
the core assaying 5.6 p.c. tung-
stic acid (scheelite) and 1.13 p.c.
bismuth. E. Broughton Jensen,
who examined the property,
points out that “although it
would be unwise to attach too
much importance to one drill-
hole, there is nothing to suggest
that scheelite values will not per-
sist to considerable depths below
the comparatively shallow inter-
section at 300 ft. The geology of
the field suggests that wolfram
passes almost entirely to schee-
lite at depth.
It is proposed to develop the
property immediately to 235 ft.
Between this depth and present
bottom levels the following re-
sults are expected;
Quartz, Concentrates, WO3,
Lode. Tons. Tons. Tons.
No. 1 .. 3550 164.0 69.0
No. 2 .. 3000 • 143.7 74.5
The figures are based upon bulk
sampling of mine ore (3.5 p.c.
WO3) and other work carried
out by Mineral Resources.
With WO3 at, say, only £l6
per unit (London-average for
August was £S26 9s. 2d., equal
to £A33 Is. sd. per unit),
and assuming the recoverable
head value of ore to be no more
than 2 i p.c. WO3, the ore would
be worth £4O per ton. On a
monthly throughput of 500 tons,
costs are not expected to exceed
£l2 per ton. On these conserva-
tive estimates, the profit would
be £168,000 p.a. Plans are in
hand to deal with the water,
timber and labor problems.
The future of the mine lies in
developments below present
bottom levels, including the
opening-up of new shoots,
known but not yet proved, upon
what happens in connection with
the price of wolfram (now a
scarce and internationally-con-
trolled strategic material) and
upon the level of costs.
On the board are G. C. Camp-
bell, E. Broughton Jensen, F. W.
King and C. R. McArthur.
London-controlled Sons of
Gwalia, operating near Leonora
(W.A.), has been able, with the
assistance of the lift in the price
of gold in Sept., 1949, to more
than offset the effects of rising
costs and taxation by increased
production. Here are operating
results over the last three years:

* Including development, f After deduct-

Last year’s recovery (93.1 p.c.)
averaged s.ldwt. A rise of
475. 9d. a week in wage-rates,
etc., and higher price of stores,
were responsible for the growth
of ss. 7.2 d. in working costs,
which include development
(£13,487, up £6840). The £27,962
of profit was written after allow-
ing £35,000 (up £17,000) for
U.K. income (£20,000) and
profits (£15,000) taxes, and was
equal to 17.2 p.c. on the £162,500
of capital as against 12.3 p.c,
for 1949. The nominal rate of
dividend was lifted from Is.
to 2s. per 10s. share, but the
profits tax reduced the net rate
to shareholders to 10.5 p.c. as
against 5.5 p.c. for 1949. Ore re-
serves were 593,530 tons (down
8694 tons) averaging 5.54dwt.
For the first half of 1951 gold
production was down by 18400 z.,
due partly to breakage of the
crankshaft in the main winder.
It is hoped to recover part of
this loss during the last half of
the year. The hanging-wall ore-
bodies are not expected to be
extensive, but should yield a fair
tonnage of average-grade stuff.
When the books closed current
assets totalled £153,619 and cur-
rent liabilities £52,814. The Aus-
tralian market prices the scrip
at 14s. as against 16s. lOd. in
January last.

THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY.
The Federal Budget for 1951-
52 is a huge one, and is in many
ways a commentary on the times
in which we live and the way we
have chosen (or have been
forced) to live in them.
An expenditure of £9OO-odd
million is considerably more
than the whole national income
in 1938-39 —that is, if we accept
a 1939 £ as being the same as
the 1951 £. In the year to which
it applies the £9OO-odd million
will represent about a third of
the national income. In 1938-39
the total of Federal Government
expenditure was roughly a tenth
of the national income.
The proportions rather than
the money figures are a guide to
the extent to which Socialism
and the Welfare State have
penetrated our free-enterprise
economy. And even the propor-
tions are subject to allowance
for the extent to which, these
days, collections of taxation on
behalf of the States enter into
Federal Budget figures. In
SI the Commonwealth Govern-
ment handed the States £l2B
million by way of grants and
tax-reimbursements. For 1951-
52 the estimate is £l6l million.
And these figures represent part
of the gross sum which is, in
the Budget summary, called
Federal Government expenditure.
The Menzies-Fadden Govern-
ment was elected in 1949 with a
mandate to put value back into
the pound. It has been obstructed
in this purpose ever since by the
“Labor” Opposition—first of all
in the Senate, then by the
“Labor”-governed States of N.
S. Wales and Queensland, and
very recently in the successful
campaign waged by Dr, Evatt
and his followers against the
referendum proposals for dtealing
with Communism in the trade-
unions and the civil service.
Whatever may be wrong with
the detail of the Budget pre-
sented last week by Sir Arthur
Fadden, it has the general aim
undoubtedly of trying to put
value back into the pound by
monetary direction and control.
“That tricked you — she's a rear-engine job!"
It may be handicapped in this
respect by the failure of the
Government to get its Anti-Red
powers approved by the people.
On the industrial front more
may need to be achieved by the
secret-ballot legislation, and the
arbitration system may require
some revision. But a Budget
which aims at achieving a sur-
plus of revenue over expenditure
in a time of rampant inflation is
to be commended.
Indeed, many Keynesian eco-
nomists and those to the Left
in politics have favored the
“compensatory Budget theory”:
that is, in bad times you budget
for a deficit and bridge the gap
with bank credit; in good times
you “draw off” credit by budget-
ing for a surplus. Even the late
Mr. Chifley produced surpluses
in the later years of his reign,
though he blushed to do so, and
in one particular year disguised
the surplus as far as he could.
It may be argued that Mr.
Fadden is a year too late to
attempt budgeting for a surplus
of as much as £ll4 million,
especially as he has had to raise
both direct and indirect taxation
in order to do so at a time when
the boom, notably so far as wool
and other export prices are con-
cerned, has wilted perceptibly.
But last financial year was one
in which a general election had
to be fought in order to remove
“Labor” obstruction in the
Senate, and the Government can
perhaps be pardoned for giving
thought to things political as
well as financial during that
harassing period.
The 10 p.c. rise in personal
income-tax rates is not high con-
sidering that we are, in fact, at
war with Communism both at
home and abroad. Public-
company tax increases are hard
to justify in an economic sense,
seeing that shareholders again
pay tax in full, at the property
rate, on distributed earnings.
However, objections to the in-
crease (from, in effect, 7s. in the
£ to 9s. in the £) will be largely
removed if the Government will
only do something to prevent
current “capital erosion” by
making more liberal (and equit-
able) arrangements about de-
preciation allowances during
these times of high plant-replace-
ment costs. The abolition of un-
distributed-profits tax is only a
small concession in this direction.
There will be resentment in
many quarters against the de-
mand for an advance payment
this year of 10 p.c. of company
taxation. This resentment will
arise mainly from the fact that
some businesses have already
been financially embarrassed by
the central bank’s decision to
curtail bank advances generally.
But in difficult cases Government
economic policy may be
tempered with mercy. It was so
with the wool levy.
The cost of the Welfare State
is obvious in the estimated ex-
penditure out of the National
Welfare Fund in the current year.
The figure rises from £132,7 mil-
lion to £184.8 million, largely
because of increases in civilian
and war-service pensions and the
extension of medical benefits.
And it may be taken as a fact
that the cost of the Welfare State
by no means ends here. It is
generally admitted that the
swollen civil service has been
largely a consequence of the re-
distribution of income that is
so far the only motive force be-
hind our Welfare State. Redistri-
bution of income only—there has
been no greater per capita pro-
duction in order to make a reality
of our “social security.”
Ordinarily increases in in-
direct taxes —excise, sales-tax,
etc. —have an inflationary effect
on the cost of living. And it is
the aim of the Federal Govern-
ment to raise nearly £6O million
more this year by increased rates
of indirect taxation, apart from
higher revenue that is antici-
pated from an increased volume
of sales of taxable goods. Mosi
of the increases apply to gor is
not strictly essential, and, in the
motor-vehicle category, indus-
trial vehicles have been specifi-
cally exempted (rom increased
sales-tax.
The Budget may be judged in
some quarters to be a stiff one.
It is certainly something not to
be accepted lightly by anyone.
But if it brings home to the
community the serious nature of
our problems it will be doing a
service apart from the economic
one that is its prime aim.
It will be Mr. Fadden’s duty,
and that of all his departmental
heads, to see that the money
raised by taxation during the
coming year is spent wisely and
well, and that none is spent un-
necessarily. For it is axiomatic
that it is far better for private
enterprise to spend money on
capital goods, however inflation-
ary the situation may be, than
it is for a Government to spend
it wastefully on something else.
Misdirected Government expen-
diture is the most inflationary
factor of all.
Timber
As the gap between supply
and demand for New Zealand
native timbers grows wider every
year, Maoriland builders, millers
and timber merchants are weak-
ening in their old diehard atti-
tude towards pine, which was
once thought fit only for making
packing-cases.
Last year’s output of 160
million-odd board feet of insignis
pine was more than a third of
N.Z.’s total timber production
of 475 million feet, and was 16
times the pine supply of a mere
10 million board feet a couple
of decades ago. If output can
be lifted at this rate and sold
without glutting the market when
pine is still under a building
ban, what will happen when the
ban goes? Owners of pine
forests see demands rising in all
directions inside N.Z., and
beyond there’s an unlimited
export market. For them it’s a
bright and challenging prospect.
Pines cover 720,000 acres,
mostly former barren pumice
waste in the heart of the North
Island, and are seven-eighths of
M.L.’s exotic forests. With the
State owning half the total, and
private enterprise, backed by an
army of Australian shareholders,
controlling the other half,
Maorilanders are counting on
reaping a fortune in the next
half-century. Even railway
sleepers, now largely Australian
hardwood, will be pine, and
fencing-posts, too, as science
sweeps away obstacles and opens
the doors to markets until lately,
or still, barred and bolted.
Pulp and paper industries
should be among the best
moneymakers, and before long
newsprint will be added as an
extra goal to be won. Australia’s
ex-head of the forest-products
division of the C.5.1.R.0.,
I. H. Boas, told Maorilanders
last year they had a golden
opportunity to expand exports of
softwoods, and if they processed
the material first it would pay
them handsomely. Investors in
forestry cos. mainly Forest
Products, Whakatane Board
Mills and Matea Forests —are
rubbing their hands, after wait-
ing a long time for the tide to
come in.

Most people here agree that,
from an interest and entertain-
ment point of view, the Festival
of Britain has been stimulating
and successful.
Nevertheless, critics of the
project have not been entirely
disproved. They can truthfully
assert that Britons have shown
little tendency to be carefree or
festive. Their mood has been
one of serious but relaxed
inquiry with an hour or two
“off” among the attractions of
the Pleasure Gardens. The
theatres have had a leaner time
than was expected ; local cele-
brations up and down the
country have proved to be per-
functory, and of no more signi-
ficance than the usual garden
fete ; and the subsidiary exhibi-
tions in parts of London out of
reach of the tourists’ leisurely
stroll have been poorly attended.
The Festival of Britain has, in
fact, resolved itself into the
London Exhibition of 1951, de-
spite the higher claims of its
promoters.
Setting aside the international
outlook, political uncertainty at
home, and a fuel crisis as certain
as fog in November, even a
slight improvement in living
cpnditions might have infused
some lightheartedness into
British homes. But the food
situation, so far from improving,
has gradually deteriorated.
Housewives, remembering the
glut of eggs in the spring of
1950, looked forward to a
similar pleasure this year, and
were encouraged to do so by
the confident promises of the
From Herbert Holman
Minister of Food. The eggs did
not come. Now milk is becom-
ing scarce.
The reasons for the shortage
of both these commodities are
identical and easily found. They
are attributed to desk-planning
—or the lack of it. The
planners, desperately searching
for something to take the place
of meat, encouraged dairy-
farmers to kill the birds that
laid the eggs. And, in March
last, the Government announced
new prices to help farmers to
meet increased costs. The idea
was to add to the meat ration
by making available more home-
killed beef and also to stimulate
milk production. Farmers found
that the slight increase in the
price of milk was not worth
their while, so they slaughtered
their cattle to the extent of
100,000-head.
Trade-union Conference
The Trade-union Congress
was this year held at Blackpool.
Not in the strict sense a political
conference, its agenda seemed
nevertheless to be confined
entirely to political considera-
tions. Concern over an overt
rift in Labor-party unity was the
chief characteristic of the
congress.
The “platform” won on all
important issues, although one
resolution (calling for the
suspension of part-payment for
spectacles and false-teeth) was
only just carried —but the pro-
poser was so conscious of
“solidarity” that he carefully
dissociated himself from Mr.
Bevan. No Communist was
elected to the General Council
and the conference was behind
the Government on rearmament.
Anti-Communist feeling was
sharper than has ever been
noticed before. Fellow-traveller
resolutions were quickly sensed
and quashed.
The most noteworthy event
was the Chancellor of the
Exchequer’s hour-long address
on “Economics for Everyman.”
Certainly, there has been much
criticism to the effect that Gov-
ernment spokesmen avoid the
unpalatable truths, and that the
rank-and-file should be educated
to the hard facts of the economic
situation. Mr. Gaitskell, with
both courage and simplicity, let
them have it bluntly and firmly,
even to the financial self-
destruction that will inevitably
follow unrestrained wage-claims.
The delegates listened to him
in awe and respect—and, two
days later, ignored his counsel.
His speech is noteworthy in
this respect only; that he might
just as well have ascended Black-
pool Tower and lectured the
winds. The effect would have
been the same. For wage-claims
to the extent of another
£200,000,000 a year are in, or
on their way ; and the nation is
no nearer solving her economic
problems.
Unpleasant Play
The success of the contem-
porary Paris school of play-
wrights is the most remarkable
feature of the post-war theatre.
In particular, Jean Anouilh is
enjoying a succes d’estime that
bears comparison with the hey-
day of Shaw. His usual formula
is as simple and effective as it
is interesting. A traditionalist
rather than an innovator, he
directly follows the classical
school of Moliere and Racine,
using stock characters and “well-
made” plots.
The new French writers have
sensed that audiences are weary
of dramatic understatement and
of actors steadfastly avoiding
both acting and speaking-up. In
creating parts rich in histrionic
appeal they have realised that
the old models are the best.
Hence M. Anouilh’s gallery of
cuckolds, lovable rogues,
passionate lovers and so on;
also his employment of the
supernatural.
So far, so good. The reaction
from the cultivated tiredness of
the drawing-room mumblers is
like fresh air in a fug, overdue
and stimulating. But lately these
brilliant Frenchmen have shown
a tendency to overwrite. As if
conscious of their developing
technique and sure dramatic
skill, they have overstretched
themselves.
Particularly is this evident in
Anouilh’s “Ardele” (Vaudeville
Theatre), in which the buffo
stylism and intrigue goes
well enough in the first act
until the author changes his
mood to realism so unpleasant
as to be nauseating.
Jokes about physical de-
formities are never funny.
Here, centring on hunchbacks,
they are in outrageous bad
taste, and as shattering to the
sensibility as the detonation of
a stink-bomb in the aisle.
Added to this, two child actors
speak unchildlike lines and, in
their stage play, reflect the lust,
vice and infelicities of their
elders.
In his intention to write
an “uqpleasant” play the
author has manifestly succeeded.
And two gems of character
acting, from George Relph as
the lecherous general and from
Jane Henderson as the seamy
maid, undeservedly fail to
redeem the play from its
squalor.

This is the ninth instalment of the letters.]
Exmoor,
December 27, 1862.
My Dearest Etta,
I wrote to you last on the
ninth of this month. Biddulph
took the letters with him to Port
Denison, whence he meant to
start by the steamer for Bris-
bane, but after waiting a week
in the Port, which he describes
as the dullest, hottest and
gener "y most detestable little
1 o n. he er saw, it became
6 v*deni chat the steamer had
missed this trip, so he came
home last Monday, to our great
surprise, when we thought he
was at Rockhampton at least.
The steamer is expected again
next week, and he is going off
again tomorrow to meet her. I
hope he will be more fortunate.
It is very inconvenient that the
Murray is so uncertain, as it is
nearly 100 miles from here to
Port Denison. I expect you will
get several of my letters to-
gether, but if so you must be
sure and read those of the
earliest date first, and then they
will not be so stupid, but will
come in the form of a journal.
I am writing now chiefly to
acknowledge your seventeenth of
September letter, which reached
me on the thirteenth of this
month. You see, you may
reckon on your letters generally
taking three months to reach us.
Christmas Day is come and
gone. It was an unexpected
pleasure to have Biddulph back
here to spend it with us, and
though we were but a small
party we were tolerably jolly.
The shearing of the large flocks
on the other side of the river
is not over yet, so Mr, Devlin,
Mr. Robertson and Mr. Cressall
could none of them come into
the head-station. Mr. Taylor
managed to come over 20 miles
on Christmas morning, carrying
before him on his saddle a hind-
quarter of mutton, which he had
begged, borrowed or stolen from
somewhere for a Christmas
dinner. All attempts to shoot
ducks or turkeys failed. We
have had a great many lately,
but on Christmas Eve they en-
tirely declined to “come and be
killed.”
Mr. Woodward, a gentleman
who is camping with cattle on
the other side of the Broken
River, was invited over, and he
came early in the morning and
bestowed his company on us for
the day. He has been rather a
pleasant neighbor for the last
two months —riding over to see
us about once a week, and I am
sorry he is leaving the district.
He goes to Port Denison with
biddulph tomorrow on his way
to Sydney.
Well, he, Mr. Taylor, Mr.
Hedgeland, Beckford, with Bid-
dulph and overseers, made up the
Christmas party. We dined at
eight (we have got later and
later as the days have
lengthened). The mutton was
stu ff ed > and was rather approved
°A being the first we have had

a very superior plum-pud-
din S> apple-tart and custard, and
ai W quantity of tea completed
our din ner, which I have des-
cribed to you, that you may not
think we are starved in the bush,
Christmas Day was frightfully
hot, and there was thunder
about, which made it oppres-
sive J otherwise we do not care
much for mere heat now, but a
cool breeze sprang up in the
evening as usual, and we sat on
the veranda and were rather
merry, and drank to our absent
friends in limejuice, which the
gentlemen warmed with a little
brandy. Biddulph brought up
two bottles in his valise from
Port Denison for the occasion,
He sent some to the shepherds
in pickle-bottles.
I thought very much of you
on Christmas Day, and of my
last Christmas at home. Do you
remember how bright and cold
it was? And how we went out
on Christmas Eve and bought a
great branch of holly and
dressed the drawing-room? Here
we hung up over the pictures
some Australian mistletoe, a
pretty parasite, with bright-yel-
low drooping branches—like wil-
low in the autumn, which grows
in the gum-trees here. Beck-
ford Simpson, Mr. Devlin’s
nephew, nearly broke his neck
in climbing for it, as a branch
gave way, and he only saved
himself by catching the trunk
of the gum-tree and sliding
down.
On Friday Mr. Taylor and
Mr. Woodward departed again
after lunch, and tomorrow, when
Biddulph is gone, we shall be a
very small party —only Mr.
Hedgeland and Beckford in the
house besides Annie and me.
All the others are wanted at the
new sheep-station that is form-
ing on the other side of the
Bowen, twenty miles off.
You used to say at Danehill
that “Rachel cometh with the
sheep,” and you might say so
literally if you were here, for I
am generally to be seen walking
about with a quart-pot full of
milk and a train of nine lambs
after me. They are such gentle
helpless creatures that I am very
fond of them, though it is rather
a trouble to feed them three
times a day.
To my great horror one of
them broke his leg a few days
ago. Tom knocked down one
of the veranda benches upon
him as he was bringing in dinner
in the dark. Mr, Taylor bound
it up with splints and he hops
about on three legs and does not
seem to mind at all. Lamb’s
bones unite very quickly. The
lame lamb is called Absalom,
because he was found in the
creek caught in a tree, not by his
hair certainly, as it is of the
shortest, but by his legs. One
of the shearers found him and
brought him to me nearly dead,
but I got him round, and he
was very flourishing till this
accident befell him.
On the evening before Christ-
mas Day Annie and I were tak-
ing a walk in the bush, and Lion,
the great bloodhound, who
always goes with us, was trot-
ting along in front when he sud-
denly stopped and started back,
and right in the middle of the
path we saw a large brown
snake. It coiled itself up and
always faced Lion as he danced
round and round it in a frantic
state of mind between desire to
kill it and a wholesome dread
of its fangs.
I was rather afraid to go near
it, and still more afraid that
Lion would get himself bitten, so
at last I made a dive and dragged
him forcibly off by the ear, when
he yelped dismally and the snake
“Rachel cometh with the sheep."
took the opportunity of gliding
off among the grass.
He was about four feet long,
and those brown snakes are very
venomous. A black snake nine
feet long was killed at Port
Denison while Biddulph was
there, but the snakes are not very
numerous in this district. That
is the only one we have seen in
all our walks.
Our last pet was a young cur-
lew, which Mr. Taylor caught
and brought in one day. Such
a pretty creature, with long bill
and long legs and bright eyes
and grey downy feathers. We
kept it for some days and it was
getting tame, but one day Lion
lay down within reach of its
tether and I suppose it must
have walked over him, and he
put his great paw upon it, very
likely by accident, for we found
it unable to stand and it died.
Lion is very good-natured to
his fellow-occupants of the
veranda in general. The lambs
caper over him, and he only
utters a faint growl of remon-
strance. Sometimes he licks them
all over. He is a great terror to
us when we have clean dresses
on out walking, for he just cools
himself in a waterhole, then rolls
in the dust and finally becomes
affectionate and comes slobber-
ing up to be patted, and the re-
sult to a clean dress may be
imagined. He is a most
ferocious-looking dog, with his
deep bloodshot eyes and great
hanging ears and lips. I think
the very look of him is a pro-
tection if one wanted it.
Mr. Hedgeland has just been
making for the veranda two of
the easy-chairs called “squatter’s
delights.” They are made of
two straight poles, which are
leant against the wall of the
house ladder-wise. These are
held together by two cross-bars,
and to the bars is nailed a strip
of strong canvas, such as we
use for wool-bagging, and this
forms the seat and back of the
chair. The materials are simple
enough, but I think it is the
most comfortable kind of easy-
chair I know. American chairs
are nothing to it, as they do not
yield as the canvas does. Try it
if you want a garden-chair.
No rain yet, and the country
gets browner. Most of the sheep
have been sent across the river,
where there is better feed. We
think nothing of the thermometer
being ninety-five, as it generally
is that. If it gets to a hundred
we say it is hot. It goes down
to seventy at night sometimes,
as we know by Mr. Hedgeland’s
registering thermometer.
It is wonderful how soon you
get used to heat. I quite thrive
in it as if it was “my native air.”
Annie feels it more, but she is
quite well, and Biddulph does
not mind it at all. They say
this is a much hotter summer
than last was. I cannot think
how the trees keep so green, but
they are a most brilliant green.
The bush flowers are all over,
and we shall have none now till
autumn.
Your most affectionate sister,
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
January 27, 1863.
My Dearest Etta,
Biddulph came home on the
fourteenth not having been to
Brisbane at all, only to Port
Denison. He found he could
settle part of his business there,
so he then and there “sum-
moned” Mr. Palmer, the man
who had invaded his property ;
and Biddulph obtained judgment
against him that he was to leave
the territory immediately. So
Biddulph remains in undisturbed
possession of four blocks of fine
country. Each block is five
miles square. It was a most
iniquitous attempt of Palmer’s.
Biddulph bought the station in
question sometime ago, cheaply,
no doubt, and Palmer asked him
to let him “lamb-down,” as it is
called, on some part of his coun-
try as he (Palmer) had no place
of his own.
Biddulph gave him leave to
go on this new station for a few
months, and then the fellow
claimed it on the ground of prior
occupation.
Biddulph brought home with
him a Mr. MacDougall, a gentle-
man who is in treaty for the
purchase of the abovenamed
station, and I believe will buy
it. Biddulph does not want to
keep two stations in hand. Ex-
moor alone is eight blocks, or
forty miles square—not square
miles. Both Biddulph and Mr.
MacDougall came in sorely
afflicted with the “sandy blight.”
Biddulph could hardly see at all,
and rode in 20 miles with his
eyes shut, letting his horse follow
Mr. Devlin’s.
The day after they came in
arrived Mr. Williams, the lieu-
tenant of the Mounted Police,
with four of his troopers; he,
too, had the blight very badly,
so there were three blind men
here at once. Annie and I used
to read aloud to Biddulph all
day; it was so terribly dull for
him to sit in the dark doing noth-
ing. That sandy blight is, in
fact, the Egyptian ophthalmia,
and in summer people suffer
greatly from it. We have an
eye-lotion that soon cures it if
used in time, but it is extremely
painful while it lasts.
We were a party of ten in the
house for some time, and the
station looked quite gay with
the troopers camped about. The
blight got better and Mr. Wil-
liams and the troopers departed ;
they were in pursuit of two run-
away blacks, but on their way
back they are going to stop and
clear our station of wild blacks.
Mr. MacDougall also left, but
returned yesterday, and to-
morrow he, Biddulph and Mr.
Hedgeland start together for
Rockhampton overland. The
little steamer to Port Denison is
so very unpunctual and Bid-
dulph is so tired of waiting
about in the horrid little port
PEOPLE IN THE
LETTERS.
RACHEE HENNING, the writer of
the letters, born 1826, came to Aus-
tralia in 1854, returned to England
in 1856, and settled permanently
in Australia in 1861.
HENRIETTA (“ETTA”) HENNING,
born 1827, married Rev. T. W.'
Boyce, and remained in England.
ANNIE HENNING, born 1830, came
to Australia in 1853 with Biddulph.
AMY HENNING, born 1832, came to
Australia with Rachel in October,
1854, and in September, 1855,
married Thomas Sloman, a banker,
of Bathurst (N.S.W.)
BIDDUEPH HENNING, born 1834,
came'to Australia in 1853. Visited
his married cousin Eindon Bid-
dulph near Wollongong, then
leased a farm from Rev. Sparling
at Appin. Eater he bought 180
acres of Crown land near Rixon’s
Pass, Bull! Mountain, at 255. an
acre, and built a house there in
1855, He sold this in 1857 to Henry
Osborne. Bought Marlborough
station (64,000 acres, near Rock-
hampton) for £9OO in November,
1838. In 1862 he moved north to
Exmoor, on the Bowen River, near
Port Denison, his sisters Rachel
and Annie accompanying him.
[The foregoing were the children
of the Rev. Charles Wansborough
Henning, M.A. (son of Edmund
Henning, of Poxweli House, Dorset),
and of Rachel Eydia Henning (ne«
Biddulph). The parents were both
born in 1797, and married in 1825.
Charles died in 1840, his wife in
1845.)
EINDON BIDDUEPH and TRE-
GENNA BIDDUEPH were cousins
to Rachel Henning on her mother’s
side, and belonged to the well-known
titled family of the name. Tregenna
married in England in 1857 and then
settled in the Shoalbaven district of
N. S. Wales.

What’s the value of a tyre gauge? If It isn’t
accurate, it’s worthless. If it is accurate —and made
to stay accurate — it’s worth every penny of its cost.
That’s the Kismet for you . . . truthful every time
. . . which means a properly balanced car, comfort-
able to ride in, safe and easy to drive.
AND what price a Foot Pump? Or a Hand Pump?
Just ask your Garage Man to let you try a Kismet.
See how easily its double-cylinder action inflates a
tyre! Then examine it closely . . . note the fine,
solid Sheffield workmanship.
You’ll never grudge the little more you pay for a

that they prefer riding to Rock-
hampton, though it is near two
hundred miles further.
Biddulph has still to go to
Brisbane on some other busi-
ness, and then he will go on up
the Burnett River to buy more
sheep, so we shall not have him
back, I am afraid, for two
months at least. I cannot bear
him to be away, but business
cannot be neglected.
Mr. Hedgeland is going down
about selling some country that
he has, and we and the station
will be left in the care of Mr.
Taylor, Mr. Cressall and Mr.
Robertson.
We have had some heqvy rain
lately, and the country looks
quite green, the cattle and horses
are getting fat and my lambs do
not require nearly so much
feeding ; they run about and eat
grass, but I do nqjt like their
going very far for fear of their
being killed by native dogs. One
was killed the other day, found
dead by the creek. I believe I
cried ; I was so sorry. However,
I also vowed vengeance, and I
got Beckford to make a dozen
“baits”—that is a morsel of
strychnine put into a bit of suet
and each bait screwed up in
paper; then Beckford, Mr.
Cressall and I set out in the even*
ing, Beckford dragging an odor-
ous piece of meat by a string be-
hind him to make a “trail,” I
with my apron full of baits. Mr.
Cressall laid them at intervals
along the trail under convenient
trees.
Of course we tied up the
station dogs that night. Next
morning eight of the baits had
been eaten, so we had probably
poisoned four or five wild dogs.
The same process was repeated
yesterday, and seven baits were
taken. So I hope the lambs are
safe for the present. Those wild
dogs are a terrible plague to
squatters, but their numbers get
thinned by constant poisoning.
My writing is not assisted by
a little tame parrot which insists
on sitting on my
pen and biting
the nib. Tell
Constance it is a
pretty little thing with blue and
yellow feathers. It walks about
on my shoulder and sits on my
head, and eats bits of sugar out
of my mouth. The lambs, t»o,
are very tame; one follows me
everywhere, and is just now
lying under the table at my
feet.
We have heard of the case we
thought was lost. The agent
never forwarded it from Rock-
Pen-drawings by
Norman Lindsay
hampton, where it still is, so my
writing materials, summer
dresses, etc., will arrive in time.
The whole station is engaged in
saddlery just now. It is won-
derful how soon people learn to
do everything for themselves in
the bush. Mr. Taylor and Mr.
Hedgeland are now lining the
saddles, and Biddulph has made
a quantity of new girths, stirrup-
leathers and surcingles.
We have been doing a little
ironing lately, for our washer-
woman has departed. Her hus-
band, the carpenter, would not
work, so they are gone, and
Biddy, a black gin, washes at
present. The things are of
rather a remarkable color when
they come out of her hands, but
she does her best, and we wash
collars, etc,, ourselves.
We have such a very easy life
here that this does not hurt us.
We shall have another servant in
a month or two, as Biddulph will
get one at Brisbane.
Ever your most affectionate
sister.
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
April 27, 1863.
My Dearest Etta,
To begin with my principal
news: Biddulph is come home
again, I am happy to say, much
before we expected him. He
arrived on March 30, having
been absent exactly two months.
He had satisfactorily accom-
plished his business in Sydney
and Brisbane, but he had not
been up thp Burnett River, as he
was obliged to be back here in
April. He was looking very
well; all the better for his trip
and was in capital spirits.
He had a great deal to do
when he came back in arrang-
ing and setting things in order
on the station, particularly in
getting rid of a lot of idlers who
under the cook’s auspices had
quartered themselves in the
kitchen, some under the pretence
that they were
waiting to see
Biddulph about
wages or work.
One man said he was ill and
could not “move out,” another
that “he had met Biddulph on
the road, who told him to wait
here for him.” I was amused to
see the celerity with which four
or five of them were packed off
the next morning, and the re-
maining one was sent out to
“shepherd” that he might work
if he wished to stay. Mr.
Devlin, the superintendent, is a
“I dragged him forcibly off by the ear."
meek old gentleman, who said
he had “no orders” to send
people away.
Biddulph brought home with
him, as a sort of supernumerary,
a Mr. Julian, a lad of fifteen or
sixteen, whom he met with in the
steamboat. He was only just
arrived from England (Devon-
shire), 1 think he must be
related to those Exeter Julians
whom you remember in the old
days. He expected to find some
friends in Rockhampton, but
they had left, so he was very
glad to come with Biddulph and
learn “colonial experience” here.
Of course he gets no salary, but
is expected to make himself
useful for his lodging and board.
I am sorry to say that Bid-
dulph is leaving us again next
week ; he has bought 7000 sheep
at Dalgangly, in the Burnett
country, and has to go there him-
self to take delivery of them. It
is an overland journey of some
hundred miles, and he will be
absent for another seven or eight
weeks. r He means to take young
Julian with him, I believe, and
possibly Mr. Taylor, who is the
sheep overseer, to superintend
the driving-up of the flock. Of
course Biddulph will not wait
for that process, which will take
three or four months, but will
come back directly.
I told you some time ago
about the hopeful young lady
we had as a servant; she has
turned out much better than we
expected, however, and made a
very good laundress and house-
maid. She has been here eleven
weeks, and Tom the cook has
fallen in love with her and
announced that they were going
to be married, which would
have removed all objections, but
Biddulph, not knowing this,
hired in Brisbane an Irish
family, recently imported, wild
from the Galway bogs.
They consist of the father and
five children ; the father, a lame
old gentleman, apparently very
infirm, who scuffles about in
slippers as if he was walking on
hot eggs and always carries his
mouth open, a practice which, it
is prophesied, he will soon leave
off in this land of flies; a
daughter of seventeen, hand-
some, but who walks exactly as
if she was carrying a load on her
back. She says she can wash
and iron. A good-looking boy
of fifteen or sixteen, another
about twelve; and two little
girls, younger still.
I believe the old man is a
good blacksmith ; he shod some
horses very well, but Biddulph
set him to dig the garden a few
days ago, and he was seen still
in his slippers hoeing among the
wet weeds, for it was rainy
weather, till Biddulph ordered
him back to the house, for he
was doing no good, and only
catching the rheumatics.
“The family” came up as far
a s the Twenty Mile station in
one 0 f the drays, and from
thence Mr. Cressall went to
fetch them in a springcart. He
gives a most entertaining account
Q f the eldest boy getting down to
get a drink at a waterhole, and
presently they heard most
hideous yells and howls from
the scrub where he had gone,
jhe father and all the family
began to howl likewise and
wring their hands. “Oh Johnny’s
feilt entirely, to think of him
coming all this way to be kilt
and murdered!” But they never
made the smallest attempt to go
to the rescue,
Thinking that he had really
either seen some blacks or got
bitten by a snake, Mr. Cressall
took his carbine and went in the
direction of the shouts. He
found the boy with the perspira-
tion streaming down his face and
near ly frantic, as he said he had
I° st himself. The best of it was,
th e cart was in sight the whole
time if he had only looked in
the right direction,
We h ave n °t got your parcel
y et > but it is at the port. Bid-
dulph brought it up from Sydney
w ith him, but, as he rode up
from Port Denison, of course he
bad to leave it to be brought up
b y the drays. He opened the

THE WHIPSTICK ROOM
By RODERICK M. DAW
Since this story was accepted, the author has asked
us to include a dedication to Paddy Troy:
Once, when I was very young, I said, “I’ll write a
story about you one day, Pat." You chuckled, liking
the idea. “Put a couple of murders in every page,
because Pm a terrible ferocious fella." I demurred, so
you temporised. “Well, at least let’s have some stoush
in it somewhere.” I heard of your death the day this
was accepted. So here’s your story, Pat, and I’m sorry
it was a little late, old friend.
PADDY OTROY glanced
across at his young com-
panion. The boy looked
up and grinned happily.
Paddy said “It’s a wonder you
don’t put in your holidays at the
station, ’stead of out here ridin’
round in the wet.”
Jimmy Gaiter hawked and
spat the way he’d seen Paddy
do it.
“Aw, I wouldn’t swap, Pat.”
He guided his horse round a
stump and dug it in the ribs with
his heels so as to keep up with
old Hector. No, he wouldn’t
sw’ap for all the tea in China
and the station parties thrown
in. He was just exactly where
he wanted to be, hunting
kangaroos with Patrick O’Troy.
This was what he’d been think-
ing about all the last term.
What he’d been living for. And
now he was here, with Paddy
and Hector and Paddy’s pack of
hounds.
The best kangaroo-dogs in the
country, and everyone knew that
Pat was the best hunter. Some
said he was half-kangaroo,
that’s why he got so many.
Jimmy looked through the
dnzzle of rain out over the big
Ha:. The dwarf tea-tree brushed
against his legs and boots, but
hey were long since wet through
i he didn’t notice it any more,
ne flat seemed to go on and
on into the mist. Good ’rooing
country, too. You could gallop
a horse over it practically any-
where, except of course through
the whipsticks. The whipstick
tea-tree was too thick for a horse
to enter in most places. They
grew tall and straight and no
thicker than your thumb. Paddy
said there were a lot of ’roo
camps in the whipsticks.
For a time they rode on in
silence, the lean, hard, old man
and the pink-cheeked boy. The
dog Sandy was well ahead,
sometimes as far as half a mile,
when following a scent, always
moving restlessly back and for-
wards across the line of march.
A dog you could trust, Paddy
would say. A great, thickset,
swaggering broth of a dog,
without fear of anything. He
bossed the pack with the casual
efficiency of a born leader, and
Sandy would laugh at you after
a Too had been killed. He’d sit
on his haunches, look up into
your face and purely laugh. He
was no greyhound or staghound
or Queensland cattle-dog, but
probably the best blood of all of
them was in his veins. He gave
you the idea that he had far too
much commonsense.
The boundary-rider’s children
loved him, they could pull his
long, smooth tail and ride on his
yellow back until he became
tired of it. Then he would bump
them over with his big chest and
lick their faces when they were
down, and they would run
inside with screams of laughter
to get out of his way. He wasn’t
fast, of course, but then he
didn’t have to be very fast. His
job was to find the Toos and if
possible turn them back to the
pack. His deep bark had a
bell-like resonance, and down-
wind could be heard for four
or five miles.
Paddy rolled a cigarette and
cupped his hands as he lit the
match. He said “How’s high
school goin’? Got into any
fights?”
Jimmy didn’t take his eyes
from the white tip of Sandy’s
tail up front. “Had a couple at
the start. I guess it’s pretty
good though.”
“Did your cobber Blackwell
go up to high school, too, this
year?”
Jimmy said “No, he left after
the first year.”
It was an old story they had
talked over before, about Black-
well. He was two years older
than Jimmy and nearly twice as
heavy. He was the bully-boy
who turned young Gaiter’s
grade-school life into the kind
of hell that only small boys can
know, who are subjected to the
derision and torment which goes
with schoolboy persecution.
Jimmy said “No, I guess it's
pretty good without Blackwell.”
He looked up at Paddy. “I’m
going to lick him good when I
get big.”
The Irishman laughed. “Good
on you, mate, I hope I’m there
to watch.”
The boy smiled. It was nice
to be called “mate” by a man
like Paddy. Right then he could
have licked all the Blackwells in
the world.
"T HEN it came, the deep, full-
-1 throated bay from Sandy.
It was a thing to quicken a
man’s heart and send the blood
singing through your arms and
chest. The pack, which had a
second before been trailing
along behind the horses, appar-
ently asleep, was instantly at a
dead run. They saw him then,
the father and mother of all
kangaroos, loafing along fifty
yards or so ahead of Sandy.
Paddy’s horse stumbled.
“Damn you, Hector, to hell,”
he roared. “Don’t you ever do
nuthin’ but fall over?”
They broke into a brisk trot.
Jimmy was laughing at Paddy.
The Irishman’s anger and bad
language were all part of the
business, for Paddy cursed
Hector on all occasions whether
Hector needed it or not. The
horse and man had been to-
gether in the bush for fifteen
years.
Jimmy’s pony broke into a
canter and drew ahead. Paddy
said “There’s no hurry, he’s too
big to go far. The big ones can’t
travel. He’ll start to circle when
the pack gets near him, and then
he’s ours.”
As the pack drew near the
big Too swung a little to the
right and caught sight of the
dogs. Paddy said “There you
are, I told you he’d circle.” But
the old-man Too was heading for
the hills and moving like the
wind. Paddy said “Gripes, he
can go, can’t he!” He wasn’t
worried. The fast ones, the
flying does, couldn’t beat his
pack in the open.
A few minutes later Jimmy
proclaimed the obvious. “They
aren’t gaining on him too much,
Pat.”
Patrick O’Troy was silent.
He was seeing something that
he couldn’t quite believe. The
biggest kangaroo he’d seen in
thirty years was clearly leaving
his pack in the dust, or rather
the mud. They saw the Too
reach the hills at the end of the
three-mile chase. The pack was
beaten before then. They were
trotting back over their tracks.
Paddy stopped Hector for a
blow and looked at the boy.
“You saw it, didn’t you?”
Jimmy grinned. “Couldn’t
help it, I was watching.”
“Just as well you was with
me, because the old woman
wouldn’t believe me if I told her
on me own.”
A S the first of the dogs
trotted up: “Well,” roared
Paddy. “What do you think of
yourselves, you flaming dingo-
baskets? Don’t never look me
in the face again. Don’t never
come to me for tucker no more,
you half - slow, paddle - footed
lap-dogs, g’way, t’ hell with y'! ”
The fastest pack of dogs in
the whole country fell into a
crestfallen line behind the
horses. The white tip of Sandy s
tail was waving above the dwarf
tea-tree a quarter of a mile in
front as they turned for home.
Mrs. O’Troy came outside to
watch them unsaddle. She was
a tall angular woman, wrinkled
from sun and winds. A home-
made cigarette dangled from her
lips. She said “No luck, Pat?”
Paddy grunted and took the
bridle off Hector.
He gave her a peck on the
cheek. “No, hon, my poor
busted-up hounds can’t catch an
old man any more.”
Jimmy rushed to the pack s
defence. “Gee, Pat, he wasn’t
no ordinary old man they
missed, he was something
special. They didn t have a
hope.” , .
Mrs. O’Troy’s bright eyes
flickered back to Paddy. What
happened?”
Paddy bent his head to go in
the door. “They couldn’t catch
the biggest old-man Too I ever
saw, that’s what happened.”
Mrs. O’Troy put the kettle on
the centre of the stove.
a good start on ’em, did he,
Pat?”
“Start!” Paddy snorted.
“They caught right up to him,
and then he says ‘ta-ta,’ shakes
hands all round and runs ’em to
a standstill.”
Mrs. O’Troy was suitably
impressed ; so Paddy described
the encounter in more detail.
When tea was finished and
Jimmy had dried the dishes for
Mrs. O’Troy, they joined Paddy
in front of the great cement
fireplace. The big redgum logs
hissed and cracked as they
burnt. Outside the wind rose
and fell, howled through the
timberline and faded away up to
the hills and the high places,
tumbling the clouds in swift
chaos under the cold thin moon.
Hearing it, from his seat by
the fire, Jimmy involuntarily
shivered and was completely
happy.
The light from the oil-lamp
cast nervous shadows on the
O’Troys. Paddy was asleep in
his armchair, his long leathery
body relaxed and still. Mrs.
O’Troy bent her head over a
sock she was mending. Like
Paddy, her face was creased with
wrinkles, the lines of worry, de-
pressions and wars. And the
lines of laughter.
Jimmy thought she would be
a very good witch if she had
been sitting on the kitchen
broom. A very nice old witch
of course, the sort of witch who
makes cookies that melt in your
mouth. The kind of dear old
witch who looks after you when
you’re sick, like he was a year
ago when he came out and
stayed.
The black cat with the white
front arose from the hearth,
stood straight up, stretched and
went to sleep again, curled up in

ft round pink-nose ball. She was
going to have kittens again.
Her name was Jinny - Ann.
Paddy swore she was 17 years
old and had four lots of kittens
every year and nine every time.
Jimmy tried to work out how
many kittens she had borne, but
his eyes were heavy and he
nodded. It was a power of cats
anyway.
"■p HE rest of the week passed
f far too quickly for Jimmy.
Kangaroos were caught and
their hides pegged out on the
ground. One day their bag was
fourteen, including six big old
men.
The pack was in fine form.
Bluey, who was still learning,
rushed in to maul a big Too,
and was gathered up in the
animal’s huge arms and, before
Paddy could lunge for the tail,
the powerful backleg flashed
up and the dog fell with a flesh
wound from shoulder to loin.
Then Paddy had the tail, and
with a quick twist threw the
old man on his back, and a blow
with the “mashie” ended the
fight. Bluey was still whimpering.
Paddy rolled him on his side.
“Damn’ fools o’ pups always
come in at the wrong time,” he
muttered. “Hold his head while
1 darn him up.”
Jimmy held the dog’s head,
and after considerable searching
Paddy found the white cotton.
“It’s only a nick. Stop y’r
damn’ howling,” Paddy told
Bluey as he pulled the skin
together.
Paddy said “He'll be right in
a week, he can lick most of it.”
Jimmy opened his knife to
help skin the ’roo; he wasn’t
very quick at it yet, but Paddy
said it was only practice he
needed.
ON the last day of Jimmy’s
holidays they came to grips
with “Nightmarch.” Paddy had
called the big kangaroo Night-
march after the horse that won
the Melbourne Cup in 1929.
Paddy had backed Nightmarch
on that day and had won “a
swag o’ notes you couldn’t
jump over.” No horse after that
was ever as fast or as good, even
the mighty Phar Lap (“the one
them bloody Yanks murdered”)
was never quite up to Night-
march’s standard, the way the
Irishman looked at it.
They were heading up-wind
toward the long line of whip-
stick tea-tree when Sandy
jumped Nightmarch. The big
Too had apparently been asleep
in a thicket. Sandy plunged in
and reappeared hanging to the
old man’s shoulder.
For a few yards he held his
grip as the ’roo started away.
The pack was already up to him,
and this time there was no turn-
ing. As the dog propped to the
ground the kangaroo was in full
flight. It was more even this
time, and the pack was having
its first run of the day.
Paddy and Jimmy were left
well behind; the boy hardly
able to restrain his excited pony.
Hector had broken into a fast
canter which was his top pace.
Paddy alternately roared encour-
agement to the dogs and invec-
tive at Hector.
As the big ’roo entered the
whipsticks he was less than forty
yards ahead of the pack. Almost
at once there was a clamor of
barking. Paddy yelled “We've
got him, boy, we’ve got the big
blankard, the dogs ’a’ got him
stuck up.”
He reached down and un-
hooked his mashie from the
saddle. It was a murderous
weapon, about three feet long
with a knob on the end as big
as a man’s fist. The head was
black with dried blood and
weighted with lead. It had killed
more ’roos than Paddy could
remember.
The pack had followed the
’roo into the whipsticks and had
him bailed up in a clearing less
than twenty yards square. Of
the six dogs which entered the
whipsticks only three were on
their feet when Paddy and the
boy arrived. The brown bitch
was lying in a corner ripped
from lungs to crutch, she was
quite dead. Two more were
lying where they had fallen,
and one was limping out the
narrow doorway with his front-
leg nearly severed at the
shoulder. The black dog Satan
and Sandy, the wise old fighter,
were darting in and away before
the tremendous arms could
gather them in.
As Paddy tried to force
Hector through the opening,
Sandy hurled himself at the
’roo’s throat. The black dog,
seeing its chance, drove down-
wards for the butt on the tail.
Sandy’s slashing jaws didn't
reach the throat. The old man
caught him as he came, and the
force of the dog’s weight carried
them both backwards and Sandy
fell with terrific force on his back
on the ground. Instantly the
claw-like hands fastened on the
black staghound, but Satan, in
savage panic, tore himself free
and dived between He,ctor’s legs
to the safely of the big flat.
The kangaroo stood up* on the
tripod formed by his backlegs
and tail as Paddy urged Hector
through the opening. Paddy
paused.
Any big kangaroo is a formid-
able opponent for a man on a
slow horse. Without any dogs
to distract the animal's attention,
it can be a dangerous business.
In the brief second the Irish-
man paused, he knew the fight
was over. The kangaroo could
look down on him as he sat
there, which made him ten or
eleven feet high, which was, as
Paddy said later, “too b
big f’r me an’ Hec.”
One quick hop brought Night-
march almost to Hector’s nose,
but Hector was leaving. Having
been in a good many battles, he
had been scratched by the rak-
ing claws enough to have a
wholesome respect for them.
He backed a step and whirled
with his hindlegs tucked under
him. The next instant he hit
Jimmy, who had been crowding
in to see the fun.
Jimmy’s pony stumbled and
plunged away. That completed
the rout. Twenty yards away
Paddy turned his horse around.
The big ’roo was standing on his
tail in the doorway. For several
seconds he stood there making
sure that there would be no
further fighting, then he turned
back into the whipstick-room,
and they heard the whipsticks
rattle as he passed through to
the quiet safety of the big tea-
trees beyond,

Women’s Letters
From Sydney
The sober Town Hall could hardly
have known itself dressed up as it was
for the Lady Mayoress’s Ball during the
week. The whole stage bloomed with
white spring-blossom, white hollyhocks
and (literally) thousands of arum-lilies,
set against green foliage. All the pillars
and the back of the hall were decorated
with pink blossom and hollyhocks with
bows and streamers, while in the foyer
and at the front of the stage were rock-
gardens with pools, fountains, azaleas,
polyanthus and maidenhair-fern. The
special floral committee, under the guid-
ance of Mrs. Instone, had also arranged
Victorian posies on every table in the
hall and altogether produced the most-
striking flower decorations seen this year.
The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
(who was wearing floating pink chiffon)
welcomed as guest-of-honor the Lieut-
Governor, to whom the 12 debs were
presented. Mrs. J. P. J. McCauley was
matron-of-honor in georgette of varying
cyclamen tones. Mrs. James McGirr
wore orchid satin. Mrs. C. M. Guiney
said that her dress was called “anchovy”
after the sauce. Its color was a subtle
pink contrasted with jade. The Donald
Smiths and the C. M, Crofts were there.
The Dr. Frank Coynes, from Randwick,
presented their daughter Elizabeth, whose
dress was diaphanous nylon net with a
si Iyer embroidered bodice. Margaret
Power, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. T. F
W. Power, was another pretty deb. in
bouffant tulle with a petal bodice.
Randwick seemed to regain some of
its old charm when the spring meeting
opened up in a little bit of genuine spring
weather. The new layout, too, now
makes strolling on the lawn in front of
the official stand quite a pleasure.
There was little remarkable about the
dressing, except the hats, which were
divided about equally into the small and
the large. The smartest small ones were
decorated at the back with ribbons or
busticTbows. The smartest large ones
s' < on top of the head and projected over
the forehead. Navy was as ever very
popu ar, but the newest color was yellow,
particularly in combination with grey.
Shantung was one of the most successful
materials for racegoing, as it seems to
have both simplicity and style. Mrs.
Lionel McFadyen’s slim cream shantung
with the lapover front looked comfort-
able and elegant. Mrs. Ted Body’s navy
shantung was worn with a small navy-
andrwhite hat. Claudia Beazley’s wide
yellow hat lined with black was one of
the most striking. Dusters were worn, but
not too much. Coolie hats were fairly
popular, but not overwhelmingly so.
The Naughty Nineties Ball, held in
aid qf the Smith Family, consolidated its
position last week of being Sydney’s most
lively party. The A.C.I. ballroom and
entrance-hall had been decorated to look
like a Victorian theatre, with a gold-starry
sky, theatre boxes and all, by Sam Hughes
and John Richards, and the fancy dresses
of the dancers tied up with the gay days
of the stage in some way or other. Mrs.
Lennox Bode, as an 1890 beauty, in a
slinky black dress with a huge ostrich-
feather hat, made the present-day beauties
look as if they weren’t even trying. An-
other trio of beauties sporting the
colossal ostrich-feather hats were Mrs.
John Amor, Mrs. Peter Campbell and
Mrs. McMerrett. There were not so
many Principal Boys as expected to com-
pete for the prize, which was easily borne
away by Mrs. lan Jacoby. The American
contingent, represented by Mr. and Mrs.
E. S. Haas, were Old Mother Hubbard
and her children, who all looked like
Pilgrim Fathers and Mothers in red cotton
wigs and Simple Simon hats. Mr. Haas
won the prize for the best dame. Mr. and
Mrs. Mel Lawton were dressed rather
lustily as Cinderella and Prince Charm-
ing, and entertained in their party the
Michael Boggs and the J. Winchesters,
who were Maid Marian and Robin Hood.
The word must have gone out that
moustaches were to be worn, for they
were almost uniform (for the men) and
very funny indeed. The floor show was
the brightest, quickest, gayest seen, and,
really, so was the whole ball.
The famous international singers
Baroness Schroder and Mme. Sinding
Larsen were guests of the Queen Victoria
Club at a reception and musicale held
during the week at the Royal Empire
Society rooms. A feature of the recep-
tion was the magnificent bouquets of
orchids which were presented to the
singers and which had been grown by
Mrs. Iris Lanphier (she was Iris Webster,
the Shakspearian actress) and by Mr.
George Bardsley. The president of the
club, Mrs. George Bardsley, wore a grace-
ful dress of grey chiffon. Her daughter
Janet’s dress was pink net posed over blue.
Oliver King and Faunce Allman were
present, also Mme. Mathy and Mme.
Marotta, Mrs. C. Bridger, Mrs. R. Perkins,
Mrs. Alice White and Mrs. Hope Gibson.
Douglas Annand, when opening the ex-
hibition in David Jones’s Gallery entitled
“What Is Good Modern Design?” said
that most people tried their hands at
interior-decorating, but few knew any-
thing about it, and that the best thing to
remember was that a room was like a
garden in that it could only be kept in
good condition by constant weeding. The
exhibition itself looked as if it had been
weeded out rather thoroughly, as there
was an air of sparseness about it, which,
of course, does represent the present
trend of furnishing. People seem fright-
ened today of richness and decoration
because these have been abused in the
near past. But the tendency to depend
on mere simplicity is also fraught with
dangers, especially when the simplicity is
not accompanied by fine workman-
ship and materials.

bibits, “view purchase” perhaps, or per-

The New Maternity Unit of the Kiama
District Hospital is to be called Birrahlee,
which is the aboriginal name for baby.
It seems a good choice, soft, pretty and
appropriate. This is mentioned with some
modest pride as the name was among
those submitted by The Bulletin
(though not by this Letter) when the com-
mittee -of the hospital asked for sugges-
tions.
Adding to the usual scamper of life in
Sydney was the lowering of prices at one
of the biggest stores. People who had
just got used to not spending much
couldn’t resist the temptation of a
genuine bargain and joined the milling
throngs in every department. Buying at
sales is an art which is not easily
achieved. You have to choose your de-
partment, concentrate on particular
stocks, grab a salesgirl, tell her your
requirements and don’t take your eyes
off her until she has brought you some-
thing to look at. Never try to look at
everything; it’s fatal. You will find
yourself burdened with articles you
didn’t want and couldn’t afford, merely
because being at a sale exercises a strange
spell which makes it necessary for you
to buy something willy-nilly. It’s best
to concentrate, or exercise control and
not go to the sale at all. The latter course
saves money, but is too galling when
friends show the bargains they got and
exclaim at your foolishness in missing
out.
From Melbourne
The Governor, Sir Dallas Brooks, Lady
Brooks and their daughter Jeanette were
in the large audience at the Town Hall
when Rosemary Bassant, holder of the
Homewood scholarship for the past three
years, gave a farewell appreciation-recital
for the Homewood Memorial Pianoforte
Scholarship Fund. Lady Brooks wore a
sweeping black gown with swathings of
orchid-pink chiffon on the bodice;
Jeanette covered her pretty floral
georgette gown with a lynx-fur jacket.
The vice-regal party was received by the
Ormond Professor of Music, Sir Bernard
Heinze, and Lady Heinze in a black
French crepe gown and dyed-ermine
coat. Rosemary’s lovely frock was of
white and gold brocade, the overskirt
worn over a sheath skirt, and the short-
sleeved bodice gracefully shirred. Her
mother, Mrs. George Bassant, wore
black-and-white Chantilly lace, Mrs.
G. R. Nicholas’s laces were shell-pink.
A fitted full-length coat of black faille
was the choice of Mrs. O. Thring. Mrs.
J. Fitzgerald covered her wine-red
draperies with a grey squirrel coat. Mrs.
T. Allan McKay’s frock was of black-
and-midnight-blue-striped tie-silk. Mrs.
Guy Bakewell contrasted her black gown
with a scarlet chiffon drape.
A glance at this Dickinson-Monteath
photo makes it obvious that 21-year-old
Margaret Nisbett can face the gaze of a
big audience with perfect serenity;
that she has a voice to match her beauty
she proved by winning from over 700
entrants the rich Mobil Quest for 1951.
Hailing from Regent (Vic.), the golden-
haired young coloratura soprano has
been studying for only two years—a
remarkable achievement. She made her
bow to opera audiences at the Melbourne
Princess last February, when she appeared
as Rosina in “The Barber of Seville.”
Three months later she scored a resound-
ing success as Gilda when the soprano
scheduled for “Rigoletto” fell ill and
Margaret at short notice substituted.
Now touring the capital cities with the
other six finalists, she financed her studies
by doing part-time stenography.
Canadians met at a late-afternoon
party at Glendower, Queen’s-road, to do
honor to their High Commissioner, C.
Fraser Elliott, and his wife. P*ink roses
and veiling adorned the small navy hat
Mrs, Elliott wore with her navy suit.
Receiving the guests were Mrs. A. A.
Black, president of the Canadian
Women’s Club, who wore a black frock
and a colored sequined black cap, Mrs.
Clare Couse, wife of the president of the
Canada Club, in junior-blue suit and
matching coolie hat, and Mr. R. Howe,
president of the Canadian sub-branch of
the R.S.L. Mrs. Russ Carson’s frock
was of black-and-gold-striped faille. Wife
of the Commercial Counsellor for
Canada, Mrs. Frank Fraser, wore a black
French crepe jacket-suit which had gold
lame cuffs and collar; lime-toned flowers
were in her black hat. A black-and-
green-striped tie-silk frock and small
black hat were the choice of Mrs. H. C.
Chase. Mrs. F. Fenton’s bright rust
wool duster-coat was worn with a wide-
brimmed black velvet hat. Mrs. Roy
Blake’s gaberdine coat was dove-grey.
Mrs. C. Wilson’s turquoise-blue frock was
worn under a black caracul coat Mrs.
W : J. Neill contrasted her beige jacket-
suit with an emerald-green cloche.
A money-spinner for Prince Henry
Hospital funds was the millinery parade
organised by Mrs. J. T. Lennon, and held
at the Wattle. Hats were from the Patric
and Yvonne Whittam salon. Mrs. J. T.
Lennon’s own hat was a straight-brimmed
black straw with a large black taffeta
bow. President of the hospital, Mrs.
W. K. Burnside, was in grey angora
frock, mink coat and feather-tipped
brown cloche. A dyed-ermine coat was
worn by Mrs. Ralph Bryant over a
brown-and-beige-checked suit; her head-
hugging hat was of beige felt. Mrs. Les
Coleman’s suit was of hunting-green
wool, Mrs. W. P. Mein’s black hat,
brightened with pink ribbon, was worn
with a black suit. Mrs. A. E. Coates
wore a bottle-green felt hat with her
black suit.
Catherine Good, daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. R. N. Scott Good, was guest-of-
honor at a farewell party given at the
Lyceum Club by her sister, Mrs. Michael
Thwaites, before she left by air for the
U.S.A., where she will spend six months
as a guest of the Moral Rearmament
Movement. University and social-service
friends made up the bulk of those who
gathered to speed Catherine on her
journey.
To celebrate the engagement of their
daughter Annabel to Peter, second son
of Mr. and Mrs. L. V. Giles, of Sussex,
England, Mr. and Mrs. C. R. Murray, of
East Ivanhoe, gave a buffet-dinner party
at the Windsor. Guests included Mr.
and Mrs. G. Henderson, Mr. and Mrs. T.
Ring, the Bruce Wilkeses, Ken Giles, Mr.
and Mrs. W. Pattinson, Mr. and Mrs. F.
Shillabeer, Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Brown
and Mr. and Mrs. W. Paterson.
Beryl Taylor, who becomes director for
Junior Red Cross in Victoria in succession
to Grace Logan, who has resigned, is
no stranger to the ramifications of J.R.C.
work —for the past six years she has been
its secretary. Altogether she has been
with Red Cross for 11 years; she spent
the war years working at Heidelberg
Military Hospital.
A parade of old-world gowns, many
of historical interest, will be a feature
of the fete to be held in Melbourne
Town Hall on October 10 to aid the Play-
grounds and Recreation Association of
Victoria. They will be modelled by
members of the Country Women’s Associ-
ation. The fete, which will commence
at 11.30 a.m., will be opened by Lady
Brooks.
Mrs. Norman Lynch, of notable energy,
and who is never deaf to any charitable
plea, is giving a card-afternoon at 9
Darling-street, South Yarra, next Monday,
October 8. The proceeds are in aid of
the building fund of The Terricks,
recently purchased at Hawthorn to
accommodate the Young Christian
Workers arriving from Great Britain
under the Commonwealth Immigration
Scheme. Tables may be reserved by
ringing Mrs. P. Fogarty (XM1353), Mrs,
T. Culhane (LF9825), or the president of
the committee, Mrs. Leo Little (XM1744).
Bowls of many-hued spring flowers,
all picked in the garden of her University
home, were arranged by Mrs. George
Baton in the reception-rooms when she
and her husband, the Vice-Chancellor,
Prof, G. Paton, entertained members of
the professorial board at a late-afternoon
party. Mrs. Paton, whose black French
crepe jacket-suit was contrasted with
touches of aqua-blue at the neckline, was
assisted by her daughter Jeannine, who
looked the very spirit of spring in an
apple-green corded velvet frock. Lady
Heinze, who was with Sir Bernard, wore
with her grey suit a natty white sailor
hat finished with a red velvet band and
fine black veiling. Mrs. C. Scutt, wife
of the Uni.’s senior professor, also chose
a grey suit, her small hat being trimmed
with green-and-grey-striped taffeta.
Mrs. W. Prest, who, with her husband,
recently arrived from England, was trim
in grey tailored suit; pheasant feathers
finished her matching felt hat. Mrs. Boyce
Gibson contrasted her black Persian-lamb-
trimmed jacket-suit with a scuttle-shaped
natural Leghorn hat trimmed with black
straw pompons. Mrs. David Derhani,
wife of the newly-appointed Professor ot
Law, chose a black frock and a small
hat which was a combination of black
velvet and white feathers Mrs. K. F.
Russell wore a junior navy ensemble and
a swathed cloche of turquoise-blue gros-
grain. A tartan taffeta sash was a feature
of the junior-blue frock Mrs. Arthur
Francis wore with a pale-cyclamen felt
cloche.

Back among the friends his 14 years’
Governorship of Queensland made him,
Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, on holidays. In
Kruger’s war (severe wound, D. 5.0.),
Gallipoli (dispatches, C.M.G.), and
France (severe wound), the visitor still
has the military look, and carries it
mighty well, notwithstanding his 75 years.
“Macnell”: Moussadek’s decision to
kick out all remaining Britons should
remind Captain Wilfred Harrington,
D. 5.0., R.A.N., of better days. In 1941
Harrington had sloop Yarra (the midget
which was later to take on a Jap cruiser
squadron south of Java) in the Persian
Gulf. German infiltration of Persia was
causing concern—Nazi agents were every-
where, inciting riots, a preliminary to
the seizure of Iran and Irak oil once the
march east through Russia was com-
pleted. Tehran, though under pressure
from the British Government, would
do nothing. On May 4 the riots rose to
a climax. Yarra, under orders and clouds
of mosquitoes and sandflies, moved
swiftly up the Tigris, past Abadan to
Ashar, where a screaming mob was mill-
ing round the British Consulate. Harring-
ton slid alongside and laid all his guns
on the bravely-yelling herd. It vanished
like nomadic tents. Then the Gurkhas
took over. About a week later the Persian
Government ordered its warships to take
station at the mouth of the Karun River.
Harrington got to work. In an hour his
4in. guns had silenced the Persian Navy,
his boarding-parties jumped aboard and
secured it, while the landing-parties seized
control of Abadan,

the Kaiser’s crowd.
“Fitz”: Like Percy Lindsay (B. 26/9/’sl>,
Dr. J. S. Elkington, another veteran Bulletin
identity and original member of the old Ishmael
Club, Melbourne, had a birthday recently—his
80th. Before me as I write is a faded photo-
graph, taken in the late ’nineties, of a group
of Ishmaelites, including Percy, Lionel and
Norman Lindsay, Will and Ted Dyson,
Randolph Bedford and Jack Elkington, the only
bearded person in the group of young
Bohemians. A product of Melbourne Univer-
sity—-his father was Professor of History and
Political Economy—Jack studied medicine at
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and specialised from
the first in public health and tropical medicine.
He fought the plague in Melbourne at the begin-
ning of the century, was on plague duty in the
Punjab and was a special bacteriological officer
at the Imperial Research Laboratory in Bombay.
After combating a smallpox epidemic in Tas-
mania, he was appointed Tassie’s chief medical
Officer; then, for five years, was Commissioner
of Public Health in Queensland, later Chief
Quarantine Officer, and afterwards, till his
retirement, was Director of the Division of
Tropical Hygiene. Incidentally, Dr. Elkington’s
profession robbed The Bulletin and Australia
of a most promising writer. A prolific para-
graphist, his greatest service to this paper, how-
ever, was his persuading influence, which led to
Norman Lindsay joining the art staff in 1901.
Elkington had brought from Melbourne a set of
Lindsay illustrations for Boccaccio’s Decameron
for exhibition in the 1901 Society of Artists’
show. They were seen by J. F. Archibald; he
was so impressed that he asked Elkington to
coax the young artist to become a member of
The Bulletin staff. When I last visited Dr.
Elkington at his picturesque home at Mooloo-
laba (Q.) —from his veranda you can see the
brolgas dance on the flats across the Mooloola
River —he showed me Norman’s telegram
leaving the acceptance of Archibald’s offer in
EJkington’s hands. I was shown, also, many
rare samples of Norman’s early work—illustra-
tions for the “Rambler” and the “Tocsin,”
student’s drawings revealing an amazing
maturity, and early odds and ends that any
collector of»Lindsay items would sell his soul
to own. He and Norman married sisters, and
he delivered Norman’s first son, Jack.
The latest theatrical venture will be the
Arrow Theatre, once the Melbourne
Repertory Theatre, at Middle Park, and
the venturer will be Frank Thring, the tall
young actor who showed his mettle in
some excellent performances with Brett
Randall’s Little Theatre. He is a son of
the late F. T, Thring, who cashed his big
cinema interests in Hoyt’s to produce
Australian pictures and hired the burnt-
out shell of His Majesty’s to do it. The
first target of the Arrow will be Oscar
Wilde's ’‘Salome.”
*‘W.E.F.”: Bijj-wpf contributor and novelist
John Hardie, at 57 while visiting
Noumea for health reasons, was one of the
most unaffected figures to climb The Bulletin
stairs, and was regarded by members of the
literary staff more as a colleague than a free-
lance contributor. Hardie became a Bulletin
personality when his novel Cattle Camp gained
third place in the 1929 Bulletin competition.
Born at Troon, Scotland, and educated on the
Continent, Hardie came to Australia at 17.
A cattleman in the Territory when War I broke
out, he rode a couple of hundred miles to enlist,
but was turned down. So he rode several
hundred miles more and shipped to Canada,
where C/ ne joined a cavalry regiment. Finally
he served in France in the Tank Corps, and
later was transferred back to the cavalry, and
saw service after the armistice on the North-
West Frontier, collecting a commission. Return-
ing to Australia, he took on banana-growing
on the Tweed, but bunchy-top beat him and he
retreated to the wool and stock trade, for
which he’d been trained. For 12 years he
classed wool in N.S.W. and Queensland for the
Graziers’ Co-operative Shearing Co., of Sydney,
and in 1938 joined the permanent staff as a
technical services officer, where his specialised
knowledge was of considerable benefit to Aus-
tralian woolmen. He wrote, specially for The
Bulletin, a book on station management,
supervised the preparation of The Bulletin’s
card of standard wool types, and was a regular
contributor to the “Man on the Land” page
for 20 years. He wrote, as well, several short
stories for this paper, and three very readable
novels, Lantana (a novel based on his banana-
growing experiences), The Bridle Track and
Pastoral Symphony (first of an uncompleted
trilogy).

A well-liked clubman (Rotary and
Legacy), the new president was in France
with the field-artillery in War I, and came
home with a legacy of a stiff leg, which
in no wise impairs the solid game of
tennis he plays. His son Charles, now
in the throes of medicine, was Queens-
land’s Rhodes Scholar for 1947.
Lately passed on in Sydney at 89, Com-
mander F. W. Hixson, a company director
whose main interest was in blue
water. Son of a Royal Navy captain (who
fathered the Naval Reserve in N.S.W.,
when, in 1863, the colonies banded to-
gether in the face of the threat of roam-
ing Russian squadrons in the Pacific ; and
who led N. S. Wales’s troop-contingent
off to the Boxer Rebellion in 1900),
Hixson became himself a commander in
his father’s Naval Brigade, and ashore
made a forcible contribution to the wel-
fare of sailors; chairman or secretary to
several charitable bodies, in particular a
board-member of “Johnnies,” the R.A.N.’s
shoreside home for non-natives on leave
in Sydney.

Australian Literature. Here to study the
background of Australian writings, to
acquaint himself more thoroughly with
our idioms and slang and observe the
real Australian in his native habitat, the
professor hopes to run across as many
contemporary counterparts of Dad and

Rudd Memorial at Drayton (Q.), and the
Paterson Memorial at Yass (N.S.W.);
from the Gordon cottage at Dingley Dell
(S.A.) to the site of Lawson’s boyhood
home at Eurunderee (N.S.W.) and the
Essex Evans monument at Toowoomba
(Q.). Hp hopes to take back a large
assortment of Australian books hard to
get in America and to arrange for a
regular flow to America of books neces-
sary for his students. His own interest in
our literature gees back several years,
and in addition to lecturing he has
written on the subject for the Sunday
supplement of the “New York Herald,”
besides reviewing Australian books for
the “New York Times.” Dubois got him
on paper while the visitor sat yarning in
The Bulletin library to the “Red Page”
editor about American poetry.

well, the international friendships of
workers for humanity. The prof.’s
honors come from America, Sweden,
Belgium, France, Spain, Denmark, Fin-
land and Chile, in several of which coun-
tries he’s worked on cancer research.
Brigadier Jack (“Jo”) Mann (pictured
by Whiting) is about as modest and un-
assuming, and at the same time about as
daring and resourceful, a Chief Engineer
as the Australian Army has owned.
He is old enough to be a War I veteran
was an early-vintage Duntroon
man—and yet young enough to have been
ENGINEER.
an unusually young C.R.E. with the A.I.F.
in the Middle East in 1940, of the Ninth
Division in the next year. He was Deputy
Chief Engineer of the Western Desert
Force and earned a place in A.I.F. legend
by his refusal to be beaten by any
problem that cropped up in the darkest
days of the Tobruk era. In 1942-43
he served as C.E. First Australian Army
and he carried the weight of the almost-
insuperable problems of the New Guinea
Force in 1944 and of Second Australian
Corps in 1945. There were few technical
facets of War II with which he was not
familiar at the end. A Melburnian by
birth, he was promoted back to his
present job from Eastern Command in
1949.
Arthur Holden Lindeman, who died
recently at Maitland (N.S.W.), was the
grandson of a Portsmouth (Eng.) naval
surgeon, Dr. H. J. Lindeman. The doctor
established the first Lindeman vineyards,
on the Paterson River in 1840, building
the now historic Lindeman homestead,
Cawarra, from locally-quarried stone
lined with Hunter Valley cedar, which
stands today in almost perfect repair not
far from Gresford, Schooled at King's
College, Goulburn, and Hawkesbury
Agricultural College, Arthur furthered
his knowledge of winemaking with Linde-
mans. Ltd., Sydney, when that firm’s
cellars were at the old Victoria Markets.
With his brother Edward, he went into
partnership and returned to Cawarra,
where they ran some fine Herefords for
fats, but continued winemaking. Both
were in the Kaiser’s war. A fine cricketer
and a State representative tennis-player,
Arthur Lindeman was as well a good
judge of cattle and always a leading figure
in district church and citizenship spheres.
Into the Silence:
In Perth, at 75, Adrian N. Davies, who had
had 46 years in the W.A. Government Railways
and Tramways before retiring in 1941. Joining
the railways in 1895, he went over to the Perth
tramways, when the Government took them over
in 1914, as assistant permanent-way engineer,
rising to be chief civil-engineer. His two out-
standing jobs with the railways were a 546-
mile hike from Fremantle to Leonora to
resurvey the railway line and the reconstruction
of the Fremantle railway yards and buildings.
In Melbourne, James Gray, veteran Scottish
blacksmith who learned his trade in Dundee
at the turn of the century, came to Melbourne
and gave the city some of its finest wrought-
iron work. Among this was the now-famous
Monash Memorial gates at Scotch College. The
general was one-time dux of the school.
In Northern Maoriland, at 59, Sydney
Schofield, amateur radio-operator well known
iu the Australian ether. He was principal
lighthouse-keeper at Cape Reinga. the most
northerly point of New Zealand and the
hopping-off place in Maori mythology of the
spirits to their Elysian fields. His transmitter,
ZLICA, kept in touch with the Leda during
the Tasman yacht-race, and maintained a link
with planes searching for the missing Argo.
He was with the N.Z.E.F. at the Landing.
At 84, in Melbourne, Donald Mackintosh, in
his time a world-famous marksman. One of
his most remarkable wins was the Melbourne
Gun Club’s £lOOO handicap.

'"THE Irishman gave his horse
* to the boy to hold, and
hurried into the little clearing.
He moved the brown bitch with
his foot, then bent over the
young staghound. The dog
lifted its head and made a
feeble attempt to wag its tail.
A long rip down the belly dis-
closed the intestines. Paddy
sewed the edges together. He
was swearing steadily and
violently to himself.
Jimmy tied the horses to a
tree and came in to help. It
wasn’t exciting any more, not
with the dogs copping it like
this ; and there wasn’t much fun
when this happened. Sandy
walked over to the dead bitch
and sniffed.
Jimmy said “I wonder how
Sandy got away, Pat?”
Paddy was sitting on his heels
surveying the other dog which
had met the same fate as the
bitch. “S’pose he used his block
and jumped through the whip-
sticksj he didn’t pass me at the
door.” He got to his feet and
whistled the remaining casualty.
The dog was a half-bred Borzoi,
and the long hair under the fore-
legs was red with blood. Paddy
rolled him over, and the boy
held his head until the wound
was stitched.
Paddy looked round. “Now,”
he growled, “any more of you
awkward slobs got any
scratches?” He examined the
black Satan without finding any
signs of injuries.
It was a long ride home.
Paddy carried the sorely-
wounded Punch in his arms.
For i time they rode in silence,
then the Irishman, with an
Iris nan’s love of a good fighter,
grin ied ruefully. “The big
fella’s a grand boyoh in a
stoush, Jimmy. Y’ got to admit
that.”
Jimmy said “He’s a black-
hearted dog-murderin’ blankard,
that’s what he is.”
Paddy’s pack had ceased to
exist as a hunting unit. Two
dead, another nearly dead and
the Borzoi out of action for a
month. Two good dogs left out
of the six. “You want to carry
a gun next time, Pat, and shoot
him when the dogs stick him
up,” Jimmy advised.
Paddy shook his head, “I’ll
get him with the pack or I’ll
never get him. There wouldn’t
be no satisfaction in shootin’
him, boy. Anyhow, he’s beat
me fair and square and that’s
the way I’ll get him.”
FOUR years later the Irishman
and the boy were together
again as they always were for a
week in May and a week in
September. Only now the boy
was wearing the battledress of
the Australian Imperial Force.
On his arms were the double-
diamond insignias of the Aus-
tralian Commando.
There were other changes,
too. Hector was pastured out,
his place taken by Doll, who had
the same easygoing disposi-
tion and about the same pace.
She had not yet become quite
used to Paddy’s mock anger and
roaring blasphemies and would
quicken her walk when he swore,
her big ears turned back and
her head swinging half-round her
shoulder, trying to see him out
of the corner of her eye. At
such times the look of indigna-
tion and surprise she wore was
wonderful to see.
Paddy never tired of the game,
and several times a day he’d yell
“Doll! Damn you, walk, you
mule, walk !” just for the laugh
he’d get from seeing her face.
In Paddy there was no change,
he was just that many years
older. The pack had only two
of the old members, Sandy and
• Punch. Sandy was slowing up,
but his nose was as good as ever.
The boy was happy, it was like
old times. It was also his pre-
embarkation leave. His old
pony had been handed on to his
nieces and nephews. She was
old and gentle and cunning
enough to keep them busy learn-
ing to ride and fall off. The
horse he rode now was a lovely
thing. One of old Standby’s last
foals. And Standby had come
mighty close to winning the
Melbourne Cup. A gelding,
out of Lucknow, they called him
Mutiny. Mutiny had won every
country race they set him for,
and Jimmy was justly proud of
him.
One thing had not changed.
Nightmarch had not lost his hide,
although at times he’d been
hard pressed to keep it. As they
rode the slope of Black Hill
Paddy was telling Jimmy about
the big ’roo. “Not that I dodge
him, mind you. I’ve just stopped
looking for him as hard as I
used to. He’s too rough on the
pack, and a man’s got to live.”
Jimmy grinned. “I see what
you mean. No pack, no dough,
no good, eh?”
Paddy said, “If he gets in front
of me I have a crack at him,
but he’s so damn cunning now
I seldom see him at all.”
They reached the top of Black
Hill and stopped to look over
the vast expanse of the big flat.
They saw the horsemen im-
mediately.
AWAY to the left in a long
line were fifteen men on
horses. Each man was about a
hundred yards from his neighbor
and each man had one or two
dogs. All carried rifles across
their knees or under their legs.
Paddy said, “Kangaroo drive,
I’ve heard about these boys.
They give the proceeds to the
Red Cross and have fun at the
same time.”
Jimmy said “They haven’t got
permission from my old man to
Too ; so I better edge down and
see ’em.”
Jimmy’s father was against the
kangaroo drives because it
frightened the sheep over a wide
area, often forcing them through
the fences into the neighbor’s
property. With labor short and
a hundred thousand acres to
muster, it meant more work for
everyone.
As they watched a small mob
of kangaroos hopped out of a
thicket and for a second watched
the oncoming horsemen. The
next second they were away.
There was no mistaking the big
one. It was Nightmarch.
Paddy swore. “They’ll get
him, too. With all them dogs.
He’s a moral to stop in the whip-
sticks and fight.”
The big ’roo had swung across
and behind his mob of does and
joeys, drawing the dogs away to
himself. He was moving very
fast and two of the dogs had
seen him. Jimmy drove his heels
into the brown horse’s ribs and
Mutiny, unused to such treat-
ment, went down the slope at a
full gallop.
“The whipstick-room, the same
place we had him years ago.”
His words were lost as they
rushed through the thick scrub.
Behind him Paddy was crashing
out of the timber, calling the
dogs and cursing his horse. Once
on the flat the big brown horse
stretched out into his tremendous
racing stride. Sitting low in the
saddle Jimmy could see Night-
march with the dogs well be-
hind him. The big fellow had
nearly 150 yards on them. If
he didn’t stop he could get clear
away. But Jimmy knew that
once in the whipstick-room
Nightmarch would turn and
fight until sheer weight of
numbers would pull him to the
ground, and the slashing white
teeth would tear him to ribbons.
unc e as tbey galoped after
the dogs, but they were well be-
hind the two leaders. As the big
’roo approached the whipsticks,
Jimmy checked his horse to let
him pass and pulled Mutiny to
(Continued on page 32.)
VARIOUS VERSE
THIS EARTH.
This earth, on whose brown anxious breast, lay grass
In the eternally changing prayer of its way,
Swayed hither and thither by the priest-like wind,
Felt once a footstep blindly over it pass,
And held that curious blindness all the day,
Until the prayer, the day, the footsteps left behind,
Fled into night. Even then when the sad form lay dead,
The earth its lonely footsteps long remembered.

THE SAND CROSSING.
Right foot left foot—did I really know either one till now.
When their marks stretch out across the sand’s clean sheet.
And I’m half afraid I might be punished for it?
Right foot and left foot seem like old comfortable friends,
The only ones here but me,
Assuring me I am here, I do exist,
No matter how the sand and sea and sky
May try to cancel me as nothing, and deny
I ever made a furtive sand-dune crossing . . .
And stand alone, looking back over vagrant prints
That apologetically meet a bird’s pronged track,
Tangle with a weed or two, smooth a frozen ripple out,
And court eflacement in a giant’s drunken slide
Down a scornfully erasing sand-dune side.

Higher than sun or stone can climb.
And through their windowsi leafed in green.

A Natural Method
of Child-Planning
Now couples can plan to
have children when they want
them, by a simple method that
doesn’t violate the scruples of
any religious group.
In October Reader’s Digest,
Dr. Morris Fishbein explains
how and why this new method
works.
There are only about two
days each month when a
woman can conceive a child.
Dr. Fishbein tells how the
great majority of women can
learn when they can conceive
by keeping a record of their
daily temperatures.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Royal Art Society.
The painters of the N. S. Wales
Royal Art Society mostly go in
for reproducing the pleasant
aspects of the Australian coun-
tryside ; and this, up to a point,
those who fill most of the wall-
space at the Education Depart-
ment Galleries, such as Johnson,
Jackson and Langker, do
pleasantly enough. An essenti-
ally happy outlook is quite as
legitimate as a morbid —indeed,
preferable—and if you don't get
at this exhibition the feeling of
energy and struggle characteristic
of the less conservative groups,
you do get a higher level of
craftsmanship.
But when you come to such
paintings as Norman Lindsay’s
“Bandits at Soup” with its ex-
quisite passage of light and its
colorful figures set amongst
green foliage in the richness and
clarity of perfect watercolor-
wash, or Lance Solomon’s big
oil landscape “August Day,” with
its golden light filtering through
ragged saplings to rest on the
blue pools of a flooded creek,
you have art of quite a different
order from the bulk of the show :
in the watercolor, everyday
reality replaced altogether by
the dramatic imagination of
genius; in the landscape, the
mysterious transformation of
reality, within the confines of
exact observation and traditional
style, into something greater and
finer than itself, or greater and
finer than most of us, looking
at the countryside, can perceive.
These two paintings are no-
thing less than masterpieces, and
you cannot expect to find work
of that quality all round the
walls of a big, mixed exhibition.
There are, however, a reasonable
number of paintings which rise
above the average with some
special force or charm: notably
Percy Lindsay’s “End.of a Day’s
Ploughing,” suffused with purple
light, and two other small land-
scapes by the same sensitive and
lyrical observer ; two lovely bits
of flower-color and a rough and
vivid head of a Maori girl by
Mary Edwards; W. A. Dargie’s
‘.‘Swahili Maid,” Margaret Coen's
flowerpiece “September Morn,”
G. K. Townshend’s dramatic
white sail against the dark sky
in “The Haven” and, to come
back to a smaller Norman Lind-
say, the enchantingly gay “Sam
Pepys in Vauxhall, Gardens.”
John Baird’s cat and Douglas
Pratt’s pencil-landscape stand out
in the black-and-white section.
Howard Ashton has a sound and
hard Blue Mountains scene;
Garrett Kingsley is well repre-
sented by a landscape and a fine
portrait of a girl; there are some
thinly-pleasing Hayward Veals
from abroad ; Salvana’s “Farm
Out West”; J. H. Rousel's
“Coster Woman”; a couple of
fresh landscapes by Arthur Mc-
Neil and W. H. Hibble —enough
to make it, all round, a fair aver-
age Royal Art Society show: too
much weak stuff, too much wall-
space for the conventional land-
scapes and flowerpieces, not
enough adventure ; but a sprink-
ling of admirable paintings
throughout, and two paintings
of much higher quality than you
could hope to find anywhere
else.
Harley Griffiths.
“0.F.”: If there is nothing of
the scope and ambition to make
one think of masterpieces in
Harley Griffiths’s exhibition of
14 oils and 16 drawings at the
Grosvenor Galleries, Sydney,
there are, at least and particu-
larly about several of the oils,
a quiet, calm observation of
beauty and the faithful recording
of it with smooth, skilful paint-
ing and the selective vision which
transmutes such records into art.
Those qualities are particu-
larly evident in “Lyme Regis,”
a soft and lovely impression of
boats and water and an old
building, and in “Place Ger-
main,” an equally soft and lovely
painting of haze-shrouded build-
ings and a street disappearing,
with a hint of shadowed
mystery, between them. The
only thing one might question
about either painting—and others
in the exhibition—is a certain
dull flatness of the skies, as
though they had been filled in as
the last and least important parts
of the pictures.
“A Smithy” and two “Studio
Interiors” are rather what one
expects of such scenes, and are
concerned mainly with light
searching out color and shapes
in heavily - shaded interiors.
“Poppies” captures, in oil, some-
thing of the fragility of color
and form of Iceland poppies,
while “Highmoor” records its
green trees and grass, a cream
building and sunlight with the
translucent clarity of watercolor.
The one portrait—of a girl—has
depth both in observation and
in the quality of the flesh, and
in a “Still Life” —of pears—
the light admirably brings up
the texture of the skin and the
fullness of the fruit.
The drawings are all meticu-
lously executed and, en masse,
all very much alike, which rather
suggests a formula ; in “Canal,
Haarlem,” “Volendam” and
“Rive Gauche” the atmosphere
seems to break through the
recipe.
Jack Carrington Smith has a
small exhibition at the Mac-
quarie Galleries, Sydney—l 4
oils, seven watercolors and four
drawings. The oils are flat, light-
less and lifeless, and the drawings
undistinguished in observation
or execution, as though the artist
were ill at ease with the first
medium and too much at ease
with the second. The water-
colors fall somewhere between
the two—a facile, black line,
sometimes too sketchy and some-
times too heavy, lightly touched
in with color—and, particularly
in the case of “Mountain Land-
scape,” “Near Perth, Tasmania,”
and “Country Road,” give the
impression of light, straight-
forward impressions. “View of
Cambridge” has some of the
depth and distance of landscape.
Melbourne Show.
Everything in this Com-
memoration year had to be
bigger, including income tax
and the price of beer, and Mel-
bourne’s Royal Commemoration
Show was no exception. The
Royal Commemoration Clydes-
dales, though fewer, seemed
more stupendous and majestic,
the Royal Commemoration
Aberdeen Anguses looked fatter,
the moving pattern of tossing
manes, ladies’ habits and judges’
bowlers in the showring on the
first day was more amazing, the
hacks and saddle galloways had
shinier coats, the ponies and the
Shetlands were silkier and
prouder, and the babies on their
backs were more skilful and
more expensively accoutred than
at any previous show The
Bulletin can remember.
The only object that was
smaller—in fact, non-existent —
was the Royal Commemoration
World’s Largest Married Couple,
with the largest double-bed in
existence. Mr. Louis Monod, it
seems, still persists in maintain-
ing his ban on sideshows, unless,
of course, the Pin-headed China-
man and the Tailed Boy from
Borneo have been lured into
the ranks of the workers by the
high ruling rate of wages.
The Bulletin was thus
driven to contemplate the giant
mangelwurzel, and on the way
got lost in a welter of enormous
tractors, earth-moving equip-
ment and other manifestations
of this age of mechanisation, all
in the most dazzling colors, and
emerged therefrom to enter a
pavilion where Victoria’s lush
pastures were producing the
grandest performance in their
history in the shape of beef and
mutton.
It poured with rain on the
second day, and almost priceless
bulls and stallions appeared in
the grand parade with their
beauty cloaked, while some of
their leaders bore umbrellas.
But the weather wasn’t the worst
shadow cast over the proceed-
ings. E. H. Bruce, district
councillor at Korumburra of
the Dairy Farmers’ Association,
was heard over the air announc-
ing that under a 40-hour rural
week farmhands would earn
£914 p.a., made up of £543 Bs,
ordinary wages, overtime £3lO,
statutory public holidays at
double rates £l2 55., holidays,
plus 10 p.c., for casual labor,
£4O 175., and marginal loading
for clothing £7 16s. But the Red
Polls, Shorthorns, Poll Herefords
and Jerseys tramped on.
Borovansky Ballet.
The Borovanskys showed at
Melbourne His Majesty’s that
they have markedly improved
since their first beginnings. The
dancing in “Les Sylphides” was
superb, the ladies were lovely
and the men very wistful,
romantic and poetic. Kathleen
Gorham alternating with Peggy
Sager, Edna Busse alternating
with Dorothy Stevenson and
Miro Zloch alternating with
Charles Boyd were just as good
as one another.
As ballet is a sort of visual
art with motion, the scenery and
the lighting is as important as
the dancing, and in that con-
nection there was something
wrong with “Les Sylphides.”
The moonlit sylphs didn’t blend
with their dark surroundings,
and if they hadn’t moved around
they would have seemed
gummed on to the backdrop.
There was a lovely harmony
between the soft greys and
browns of the background, and
the whites, greys and browns of
the dqncers’ costumes in “Le
Beau Danube,” however, and it
was as easy to relax to the
ensemble as it was difficult in
“Les Sylphides.”
"Will Any Gentleman?"
Vernon Sylvaine’s “Will Any
Gentleman?” at Sydney Palace
is another of those light English
comedies—with a dash of broad-
ness here and there and a little
naughtiness which invariably
knocks ’em in the old Kent-road.
A sedate 50-year-old bank
clerk has his submerged natural
man brought out by a hypnotist
and proceeds to do and say all
the things which might be ex-
pected. It kept the first-nighters
tittering and some hearty cove
up the back guffawed with
earthy enjoyment.
Wylie Watson as the bank
clerk is competent as the
decent little man in constant
trouble, Roy Royston grimaces
too much, Roberta Hunt is too
wooden and June Owen too in-
frequently seen. Syd Loder’s
Mendoza, the hypnotist, is con-
vincing, but the evening goes to
Wilma Harrison, as a housemaid
with a remarkable resemblance
to Wendy Hiller’s Eliza Dolittle,
and to Malcolm Phillips for his
portrait of an absent-minded
and decrepit medico.
Music.
In complete contrast to his
symphonic writing, Eugene
Goossens’s First Violin Sonata,
Op. 21, is a work of consider-
able charm, its allegro fine-spun
but strong, its adagio of a
gentle melancholy which owes
nothing to sentimentality, and the
rhythm of the final movement
infectious. It was played at Syd-
ney Con. by Adam Kriegel, a
violinist with a refreshing
absence of mannerisms and with
a well-equipped technique, and
by Olga Krasnik, who brought
crispness to her work at the key-
board—the writing for the piano
is one of the work’s most attrac-
tive features. The two other
violin sonatas on the programme
were the B Flat Major, K 454,
of Mozart, all sunshine and
geniality, and the G Major Op.
96 of Beethoven, in which the
stormings against Fate yield, for
once, to placid musings.
4* 4* 4*
Henry Krips would probably
be voted the most popular con-
ductor yet to appear before
youth audiences in Queensland.
While most conductors seem
embarrassed by having to talk
about their music, Krips, at the
fifth concert of the Queensland
series, loved every minute of it.
He talked on and on about his
own taste in music, about Rafael
Kubelik, about the sombre
coffinlike appearance of the
City Hall piano—in fact, about
anything that came into his
mind. He also conducted a
widely-selected programme, in-

TITO ON PEACE.
In an editorial comment on
points of an extensive interview
which its Yugoslav correspond-
ent had with Tito, London
“Observer” singled out as of
“profound interest” Tito’s re-
marks on prospects and con-
ditions of peace.
It quoted him as saying, “with
blunt realism,” that the risk of
war “of course” exists, that a
peace settlement is still possible
on the basis of a “balance of
forces,” and, regarding Russian
propaganda for a Five-Power
peace pact, that this could be
achieved only at the expense of
the small nations. Also, he aligns
himself with Britain and
America in insisting that U.N.O.
is “the only organisation on
which firm and lasting settle-
ments can be based.”
Tito, the paper commented.

PRELIMINARIES TO AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE.
"France Amerique.”
“breaks new ground” in stating
as “the most important and
prime condition” of a peace
settlement, “that the Soviet
Union renounce all pretensions
to a right of interference in the
internal affairs of other
countries”:
“Hitherto the vital question of
what terms the West could pro-
pose that would provide for the
necessary retreat of Russia
within her own frontiers, and
would still be acceptable to
Russia without war, has usually
been left vague in official
declarations. Marshal Tito’s
formula is the first attempt to
fill that gap. It is a formula of
great simplicity, but of tremend-
ous implications.
“It must be read in conjunc-
tion with the Marshal’s opinion
that Stalinist consolidation in
the Soviet Union itself has
been ‘in the main’ achieved, but
that Stalin today dominates not
only Russia but also ‘the Comin-
form Communist parties outside
Russia,’ and that this ‘alien’
domination is even now produc-
ing ‘increasing difficulties’ in
Eastern Europe. It is also to be
noted that Marshal Tito postu-
lates the acceptance by Russia
of the principle of non-interfer-
ence as the pre-condition of a
peace conference.
“If all this is seen together,
the reasoning behind the Tito
formula for peace becomes
clear. Should Russia reject this
formula, she would be exposed
before all the world as sabotag-
ing peace through insistence on
domination of other countries,
and she might increase her
‘difficulties’ in Eastern Europe
to brea k i n g-point. If she
accepted it, she would come to
the conference table precom-
mitted to a liquidation of her
imperialist domination in
Eastern Europe and of her sub-
versive apparatus elsewhere. At
the same time, no question of
ideology would arise.
“Here,” the “Observer” con-
cluded, “is a possible way to
recapture the strategic initiative
in the great debate on war and
peace which now dominates the
world.”
On another important aspect
of this interview and one with
New York “Herald Tribune,”
the left-wing London “New
Statesman” sees Tito “feeling his
way towards a firmer relation-
ship with the West.”
Tito told the “Herald
Tribune” correspondent that
Yugoslavia “would instantly do
battle on the side of the West
in the event of a Soviet attack
anywhere in Europe, even if the
thrust should be miles away
from Yugoslavia’s own border,”
and the “Observer” that he had
proposed to the Western Powers
that Yugoslavia should join
Greece and Turkey in a “pact of
regional defence.”
“These statements,” com-
mented the “New Statesman,”
“suggest that Tito has felt it
necessary to move a long way
from the position of cautious
neutrality which Yugoslav
foreign policy always claimed to
have adopted after the break
with Moscow in 1948. While
insistent on the need for military
supplies from the West, Tito
evidently distrusts the atmos-
phere of ambiguous isolation in
which this cautious neutrality
has involved him. He would
welcome guarantees on the lines,
of Chamberlain’s to Poland and
Rumania in 1939,” He would
have much preferred the Western
Powers not taking Greece and
Turkey into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation, but instead
linking those countries both
to themselves and to Yugo-
slavia in a new Balkan Entente.
“On the home front this move
in foreign policy is reflected to
some extent by the Yugoslav
Government’s adoption of a new
economic programme that is
specifically intended to give a
new lease of life to private
enterprise. The three Western
Powers have meanwhile an-
nounced their intention of
advancing Yugoslavia a loan of
50 million dollars for the pur-
chase of raw materials.”
The Generous Treaty.
The Jap “Press” seems to
have no doubt about it.
“This unprecedently friendly
peace treaty” (Tokyo “Shim-
bun”),
“The current treaty is un-
precedently fair and generous”
(“Nihon Keizai Shimbun”).
“It is no exaggeration to say
that the peace treaty for Japan
is the most magnanimous and
unparalleled one that we have
ever had in the world history.”
(“Jiji,” one of a chain of
Japanese newspapers).
Far East expert O. M. Green
tin a London “Observer” article)
shares their view, with a doubt:
“In their hearts the Japanese
must realise that no terms so
generous have ever been given
to a defeated nation. They will
be telling themselves that their
Kami (the tutelary spirits of
Japan) have not deserted them.
Their natural pride is immensely
increased by the amazing ascent
they have made from the abyss
of 1945, and they will make all
possible use of their achieve-
ment, standing together for
Nippon as they have always
done, in peace and war alike.
They will not be easy to deal
with. Already voices are heard
saying that 86,000,000 Japanese
cannot exist in the four islands
without unrestricted trade and
movement abroad.”
Buyer Resistance.
British Press comment con-
tinues to note a “buyer resist-
ance” to woollen and other
offerings.
Finished goods at prices based
on wool values far below the
peak (a Yorkshire correspondent
has reported in the “Times
Review of Industry”) have met a
resistance from the British
public which is reflected in
reduced wholesale and retail
turnover: “It would seem that
wool goods were threatening to
price themselves out of the
market. Sooner or later the
man in the street, by deciding
what he will or will not pay for
goods, exercises an important
influence on the price which they
ultimately command. The wool-
using trades of Britain believe
it to be a good thing for wool
as a commodity that in the
season now opening prices
promise to be around levels
which may command greater,
public confidence, because that
is the mainspring of commercial
confidence.”
A “Times” report from
Manchester instanced a factory
there which turns out about
60,000 raincoats a year reducing
prices by up to 20 per cent,
“because of the falling wool
prices and the attitude of
buyers.” Directors were quoted
as expecting other similar firms
to soon follow the example.
They admitted they were taking
a chance but felt that it was
justified by the “buying lull.”
There is little doubt, says
London “Economist,” that
manufacturers are concerned
about the trend of retail sales.
The declining trend in sales of
wool textiles, it adds, is not
peculiar to Britain, It is also
happening in both the United
States and Canada, and in these
two markets British exporters
are beginning to feel the effect
of consumer resistance. In
Western Europe, too, retail sales
have fallen.
Trade Ban Hurts.
A “Yorkshire Post” writer
quotes Whitehall officials whose
job it is to interpret the signs
and portents to be discerned in
Russia as holding that the Soviet
Government is genuinely
anxious about the future of
trade relations between the West
and the Iron Curtain countries.
Also he quotes the Russians’
new English-language magazine,
“News,” as stating quite openly
that the Soviets need American
machinery. He adds:
“It is known that the Russians
are desperately short of tractors,
as a result of efforts to supply
them to Communist China.
Economic aid to China has been
by no means lavish, but it has
been found impossible to replace
the tractors which were sent to
Mao Tse-tung.
“There is no doubt that the
ban which has been imposed on
the export of strategic raw
materials by the Western Powers
is telling on the economies be-
hind the Iron Curtain. Many
of the large development plans
are being seriously impeded as
a result of the shortage of indus-
trial goods of all kinds.”
On the same theme a “New
York Times” economics corres-
pondent states that “Evidence is
increasing that the economic
pinch caused by the increasingly
effective Western ban on exports
to the Soviet Union is a major
factor behind the Soviet peace
offensive.”
German Trade.
The promised or, to some
quarters, threatened expansion
of German trade is materialis-
ing rapidly as German goods,
trade agreements and agents are
steadily spreading abroad.
Stimulated by European trade
“liberalisation,” by openings
presented by rearmament pro-
grammes, by freedom from allo-
cation and controls, and by a
fall in the demand of the home
market, German trade has, as a
London “Financial Times”
correspondent records it, “shown
a really noteworthy drive for
markets in underdeveloped and
semi-industrialised countries.”
Peru, Brazil and Mexico all
now have tidy trade agreements
with Germany,
Egypt is receiving German
optical goods, iron and steel pro-
ducts, cars, chemical prepara-
tions and finished textile manu-
factures ; other Arab countries
are being diligently prospected,
and 250 German firms will be
represented at this year’s Izmir
fair in Turkey. Further east,
“German concerns are once
more participating regularly in
all tenders for construction pro-
jects, and equally Germany is
represented at Asian trade fairs.
German trade and technical
publications are full of informa-
tion on import regulations,
quotas, customs duties and the
requirements of near-eastern and
south-eastern Asian markets.”
The trade agreement between
India and West Germany
allows for an exchange of
goods to the value of 53,000,000
dollars, and Pakistan and Wes-
tern Germany are signed-up for
the mutual exchange of
65,000,000 dollars-worth. The
value of pharmaceuticals ex-
ported to Asia in 1950 was
10,975,000 deutschemarks,. the
markets inclu d i n g Japan,
Thailand, Hong Kong and
Ceylon.
The one thing certain about
the battle for foreign markets is
that it will be intensified, and
British manufacturers, currently
being exhorted to increase ex-
ports, must face up to increas-
ing German competition in fields
which used to be largely British
preserves.
The Navy in Korea.
The war against Communist
China is, according to report-
ing, mainly of land and air. Yet
the navies of the United
Nations, most of them past-
masters in the art of blockade,
are pressing in a constant and
unrelenting circle of steel round
the Korean peninsula. Nothing
of enemy origin can move on or
under Korean waters without
danger of swift annihilation.
As a London “Times” special
correspondent notes in an article
putting the Navy share in Korea
on record, “there is a tendenc>
for the public, like Marshal
Foch in 1918, to assume that
navies have little or no part in
the victory.” The truth is that
Allied command of the seas

ling for ships which are not

patrols were not) is an indispens-
able part of the efficient opera-
tion of the land- and air-arms.
Ships alone can carry the
masses of men and material to a
foreign shore ; ships alone can
provide the parts and petrol
necessary to maintain huge
flights of aircraft airborne, even
though the planes can fly them-
selves in.
But the Allied Navies are find-
ing diversions from patrol-
monotony, and in doing so are
indicating what command of the
seas can mean to an Army com-
mander. Early this year (the
“Times” man reports) it was
estimated that some 85 per cent,
of enemy traffic heading south
from northern bases was using
east-coast roads and railways.
In the tradition of Captain
Hornblower (who liked nothing
better than a fair wind and a
well-filled coastal road), Allied
warships, among them Austra-
lian destroyers and frigates, slid
in, straightened up, and let loose
concentrated broadsides on
road-convoys, bridges, troop-
trains and enemy armor. The
result wag devastating—choked
roads, crumpled bridges, col-
lapsed tunnels, and a reduction
in traffic to 30 per cent.
Not only on the vulnerable
east coast: on the west near
Inchon, the Communists, pro-
tected as they thought by
treacherous tides (among the
world’s fastest-running), sand-
banks and an uncharted river,
massed for an attack. Seven
British frigates got the word.
Sending boats ahead sounding
(again in the Hornblower
manner), and conned themselves
by navigators who scorn the use
of pilots wherever water flows,
the frigate-flotilla nosed 30 miles
up the treacherous Han River,
and unleashed a tonnage of
four-inch shells on a massed
enemy taken completely by sur-
prise.
At Inchon, earlier, was made
that most important amphibious
landing, in which the Navy’s
part needs no stressing. As well,
there is its other long and
searching arm, Naval Aviation.
Carrier-borne aircraft have
ranged pretty well all over
Korea, taking care of what the
Fleet’s guns might miss, as well
as supporting troops actually
fighting. Recently British carrier
Glory broke all records for a
light-carrier in any theatre in
any war —in 24 hours her brood
flew 84 sorties, an outstanding
effort which culminated eight
days of intense activity, during
which her planes had averaged
more than 50 sorties a day.
In Korea “the Navy is here!”
as the boarding-officer from
destroyer Cossack shouted when
he jumped aboard the Altmark.
And Allied planes and men in
Korea owe their continued
presence there directly to that
fact.
London “Time and Tide.”
THE BIG DIPPER.
Can This Be J. Bull?
Already noted here (with
regret), acceptance of the idea
that J. Bull has slipped con-
siderably in prestige and status
since his last war is these days a
saddeningly widespread
phenomenon in the British
Press.
Anyone might think they’d
been thumped on the head with
a bundle of “Chicago Tribunes.”
As one more example, the
following is from a London
“Sunday Times” editorial:
“Nor is it nowadays only
from a Great Power or Powers
that we are threatened. Any
lesser dog in the pack may bite
our heels at any moment —now
Egypt, now Persia, or again
Argentina,
“The post-war years, during
which the present [Attlee
Socialist] Government has held
the reins, have witnessed a de-
cline in the respect felt for us
all over the world. Perhaps it
has never since Charles IPs reign
been lower than it is now.
“Yet we ended the war with
our prestige at its highest. From
what a height to what a depth
have we fallen. And why? Re-
read the series of official utter-
ances about Persia and the
answer is clear. It is expressed
in one word —spinelessness.”
And Can This Be Joe?
The “Church Times” (Eng.)
quotes a “new hymn of praise
to Stalin” composed for use in
Rumanian schools:
Thou hast lived for 70,000,000,000
astronomical years;
There is no end for Thee, Thou
livest for ever;
Atom force is a child’s toy com-
pared with Thee;
Thy power will transform the icy
pole into warm rivers;
Thy wisdom will remove moun-
tains;
Thou wilt make the world forever
fertile and mankind forever happy.
What, asks the “Church
Times” indignantly, can Com-
munists who call themselves
Christians make of this
“blasphemous nonsense”?
Dragnet Digest.
Energetic Uncle Sam. London
‘ ‘Times’ ’ editorial assessment:
“Taking Western Europe by the scruff
of the neck —and shaking her from
time to time —the United States
Government has picked her out of the
mud of defeat, set her on her feet
again, fitted her out with new clothes,
and is now pressing a rifle into her
hands.”
* * * *
Quiz. “If,” comments London
“Economist,” “there is one question
above all others that Mr. Molotov's
colleagues in the Politburo should ask
him, it is this: How have you
managed, within the space of three
years, to bring American soldiers and
money back to Europe and to kill
isolationism in the United States?”
* *
Uncle Sam in Formosa. —Quoting
the U.S. intention to provide large-
scale military and economic aid to
Formosa as one indication of
America’s “firm refusal to be pushed
around any further,” London “Ob-
server” adds; “It is a far cry from
the time, less than two years ago,
when the State Department was
resignedly preparing opinion for the
fall of that island, then considered
inevitable. It must now be taken as
an unshakable fact that America will
not tolerate the conquest of Formosa
by a hostile China, and her power
to prevent this conquest can no
longer be doubted.”
* * * *
Abadan Crux. —The really serious
consequences of Abadan, as far as
Britain is concerned, lie not in the
problems of physical supply but in
the dollar balance of payments (in
London “Financial Times’s” assess-
ment). The oil companies were the
biggest British dollar-earners; they
have been turned into heavy net
spenders of dollars.
* * * *
Cotton Catching Up. —The Inter-
national Cotton Advisory Committee
predicts that the world supply of
cotton should be very much easier
because of large production increase.
The U.S. crop forecast is 17,266,000
bales. World production is estimated
at between 35 million and 36 million
bales, compared with 27,500,000 bales
in 1950-51. Including carryover
stocks, the total supply for 1951-52,
at just under 47 million bales, will
be a post-war maximum, and roughly
three million bales in excess of last
season’s availability. Abolition of
restrictions on American exports,
together with the increase in world
production, should bring market
competition almost back to the pre-
war standard.
* * * *
Japs on the Fence. —As “probably
best reflecting Japanese opinion,”
London “Times’s” Tokyo correspon-
dent quotes this statement in
“Mainichi”: “Japan intends neither
to antagonise unduly the so-called
totalitarian nations nor to aggravate
the opposition between the two worlds
by joining the ranks of the free
nations.”
* * * *
Pearl Harbor and All That.
London “Times” on the San Fran-
cisco arrangement: “The treaty care-
fully avoids affronting Japanese
prejudices. In the light of what the
Japanese did during the War it is, in
fact, remarkable. It calls for no
admission of war-guilt; it makes no
reference to Japan’s unconditional
surrender; it imposes no crippling
material or psychological penalties.”
* * * *
Jap Army. —The majority of Japs
being “realists,” comments a Tokyo
correspondent of London “Daily
Telegraph,” “to them the menace of
Russia is tangible. So the raising of
armed forces, especially an army, is
likely to go ahead rapidly.”
* * * *
Differences in Japan. —ln the view
of Sir George Sansom, writing in
London “Daily Telegraph,” once the
treaty comes into force, strong differ-
ences of opinion on foreign affairs
will appear in Japanese political life.
Disputes, he believes, will centre
mainly upon rearmament, upon the
stationing of American troops in
Japan, and upon the future relations
with China and the Soviet Union.
* * * *
Indian Irrelevance. “New York
Times” comment on India’s having
declined the invitation to ’Frisco: “It
might even be suggested that since
the Congress party, now in control in
India, objected to waging a war
against Japan, and sought to obstruct
it with a giant civil-disobedience
movement in 1942, India’s attitude
towards making a peace is somewhat
irrelevant.”
* * * *
Cop This! — Squaring accounts for
anti-Americanism he has encountered
in England, the Dean of University
College, Chicago, in a London
“Observer” article, comments: “In
the United States there is not a pre-
ponderant body of opinion which is
anti-British; the problem is that there
is not a preponderant body of opinion
which is concerned with Britaih at
all.”
* * * %
Socialist Decline. —By no means a
merely hostile critic in this respect,
“Manchester Guardian” has com-
mented on the Attlee Socialists’ recent
statement of policy: “It merely con-
firms the common observation that
the impetus has gone out of British
Socialism; the belief in a general
saving panacea has faded. The same
fate has overcome Socialist doctrine
in other Western European countries.”
* * * *
The West’s Conscience. —Examined
by London “Economist” and found
0.K.: “The Soviet Union and its
allies are confronted not with a secret
conspiracy for their ruin, but with a
public and free defensive alliance
answerable to the United Nations.
The [West] allies can with clear con-
science go on with their programme,
whatever their relations with Moscow;
it will give them equal, not prepon-
derant strength; they are not setting
the pace in an armaments race, but
accelerating in low gear to cruise in
top.”
* * * *
P.-0.-w. in Russia. —San Francisco
“Chronicle” reports U.N.O. as esti-
mating that about 500,000 prisoners-
of-war are still in Russia, six years
after the end of the war. Ot er
estimates, it adds, run up to
1,500,000: “The various Governments
concerned can call the roll fairly
accurately on the numbers of their
citizens taken to Russia, and know
how many have been returned. The
uncertainty is in the numbers that
have died in the Russian slave-
camps.”

Of teaching rebels not to run
amuck ;
Of every ten attempting to resist

They chided nine, and butchered

Encouraged faith to take the

By having unbelievers burnt or

Or taught the Golden Rule by

The modern liberators like to

Spuds, butter, milk in short

(Of course, there’s bread and

And fish as scarce as sugar’s shy
And meat production slipping.
Gas under par and transport cut
And power blackouts daily
And candles hard to come by,
but
We meet such shuffling gaily.
Ships tied to wharves for weeks
on end
And mines more often idle
Than working, although wars
portend —
It’s plainly suicidal.
With forty hours a week we’re
set,
While things we’re short of
shorter get,
Our houses, food and clothing.
But we can’t spare the time to
fret —
We’re busy doing nothing.
P.O.M.C.
A Fantasy.
Everything was quiet and
dark in the drawer where all
the household accounts were
“All right, you're me uncle —so what?"
gathered together on the
bulldog-clip.
“Well, we’re still all here,”
said the Dentist’s Bill. “As the
oldest inhabitant, I’ve seen a lot
come and go, though more have
come, I confess, than have gone.
There used to be only a handful
of us on the clip in the old days
—nothing like the mob we are
now. I can even remember once
when there were only three of
us: a Municipal Rate Notice, a
Hire - purchase Account and
myself.
“We’d been there for some
time —our boss plays the neddies
you know —then one Saturday
afternoon he comes home all
jollo, dredges some ‘flags’ from
his kick, pulls the Rates and the
H.P.A. off the clip and says:
‘There! That’ll fix you two
blankards!’ And with a ‘You
can wait till the next winner,’
slams me back in the drawer.
“I know why I was left, of
course. He’d have copped a
ten per cent, slug if he hadn’t
coughed up for the rates, and
he’d have had to sit with the
window open listening to the
next-door radio if his own hire-
purchase set had been re-
possessed. I, being only a
Dentist’s Bill, of course, could
always wait —after all, nobody
pays his dentist until about the
fourth reminder, or until another
tooth starts to ache, and he can’t
very well go to get it either
plugged or tugged without spar-
ring up for the last lot. He
could go to a different dentist,
of course, but he'd have to pay
on the nail then, and the new
bloke might be a strong-arm
artist.
“Gripes, I was feeling lonely
there all on my pat in the dark,
I can tell you. Then he must
have got some snide informa-
tion, or perhaps he tried to pick
’em on form, for the bills started
to pile up again.”
“Well,” put in the Doctors
Bill. “I’m the second-oldest.
What I like about him is the
hearty way he curses whenever
he sees me. I rather enjoy the
paradox: the doc. gives him an
injection and thereby makes an
extraction —in theory at all
events; still, he may get paid
some day. After all, he stands
the same chance as the rest
represented here. Nobody can
say that the way he shuffles us
every pay-night and takes the
top two —it’s all the poor cow
can ever manage, these days—
isn’t scrupulously fair, although,
of course, there are a few
selected ones that aren’t in the
draw.
“For the first three months I
was here I wasn’t included in the
shuffle. Then one day he got a
letter which commenced ‘Dear
sir, Unless’ and after that
I went in. The quack’s still
whistling for his oscar, but even
he must admit he now has a
sporting chance.”
“Before the girl at the office
shoved me in the window-
envelope,” piped up the Depart-
ment Store Monthly Statement,
“she parked on me a little
gummed sticker in pretty red
print which started off ‘As this
account is considerably over-
due.’ 1 was real annoyed when
he pulled it off me. After all.
I’m only a plain statement, and
that embellishment lent me a
sort of tone, if 1 may say so.”
“Oh, he’s done that to all your
predecessors ever since I can
remember,” said the Dentist’s
Bill. “It’s just that it makes
him see red. You can’t blame
the poor devil, I suppose. How
would you like to be a human
these days? I remember once,
in a rage after getting a solicitor’s
letter about one bill, he hurled
the lot of us into the fire. We’d
have all met a horrible end only
for his missus, who gallantly
dragged us out quickly. As it
was, I got my ‘account
rendered’ badly scorched —very
humiliating, I assure you.”
“In view of my imposing
size,” complained the Tailor’s
Bill haughtily, “I think it’s
nothing less than scandalous
that I should be relegated to the
very back position. By rights I
should have pride of place in
front.”
“It’s your size that puts you
at the back,” replied the worldly-
wise Dentist’s Bill. “You’re like
me —about as popular as a
‘blue’ from the traffic-cops.
After all, he’s had his fangs
filled, and he’s also wearing the
suit. If he’s lucky your principal
might be paid for his chassis-
furniture before it reaches the
state of disreputability that it is
worn to the office only when,
cyclones are blowing, just as
I’ll probably be telescoped into
the bill my principal shoots in
for the full upper and lower sets
of ersatz dice the boss will need
when his own natural ones get
worn down to the gum-line.
You can resign yourself to a
rear seat for a long time,
brother.”
“Well,” cut in the Insurance
Bill, “I heard him selecting
Epsom and Metrop. doubles last
week. Dinkum, it was pathetic.
You can bet your life none of
us will be getting dragged off
the clip to be liquidated this
week.”
“Oh, won’t there?” grated
the Telephone Bill aggressively.
“My concern’s a Socialist
monopoly, see, and when I say
a monopoly I mean it. He gets
fourteen days like everyone else
to spar up, or his phone’s cut
off. There are tens of thousands
sweating on it. He’ll pay up for
me. pronto, or else!”
“Ignore the cad,” whispered
the Dentist’s Bill to the Doctor’s
Bill. “What else but such
vulgarity can one expect from
the New Rich!”

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
With the weather for once in accord
with the calendar, something of a
rarity over recent years, the first day
of the A.J.C. spring meeting found
Randwick at its very best —and that
is pretty well synonymous with racing
at its best. A crowd of 68,500 was
considerably short of Randwick
attendance records, but those present
shovelled a course-record sum of
£272,000 through the tote as though
they’d never heard of Sir Arthur
Fadden’s document.
Evidently the crystal ball was func-
tioning pretty well a few weeks back
when this page remarked (B.
19/9/’5l) apropos the Derby:
“The only fashion in which one
can really visualise Hydrogen being
beaten would be for some tearaway
bolter either to steal the race himself
or to so string-out the field that the
trailing Hydrogen would find it im-
possible to make up the leeway....
pie one Derby candidate who might
just possibly make matters difficult
for Hydrogen in this fashion is Tri-
zami.., .Trizami has the speed, and
his classic breeding suggests that he
may also have the stamina to be still
plugging on towards the end of 12
furlongs.”
That was precisely what happened
on Saturday, and, though he did not
win himself, Trizami was the culprit.
For a moment in the first hundred
yards or so it seemed that Trizami,
lying about fourth, was going to be
content to follow the leaders, but,
quickly sensing a move to slow down
the field, Ward shot Trizami up very
briskly to take the lead, and he pro-
ceeded to set them a merry pace.
Trizami never really got away from
the field, but was always commanding
a handy lead until they were well
into the straight. Meanwhile Hydro-
gen had been a long way back near
the tail of the field, but his sup-
porters, recalling his effort in the
Rosehill Guineas, were not unduly
perturbed, and they began to chuckle
in anticipation when the favorite com-
menced a run which saw him sweep-
ing round the field as they rounded
the turn and entered upon the run
home. Soon, however, it was clear
that Hydrogen, having got so far,
was getting no further. Channel Rise
and Montana, Both fairly well up all
the way, had closed on Trizami, who
looked then to have done his dash,
but was to surprise even the most
ardent of his few admirers by finding
another effort. For a moment, with
the post barely 50 yards off, the three
appeared to have equal chances, but
Channel Rise (B. Smith) prevailed,
and drew away to score by a length,
Montana just shading Trizami, after
whom there was a long gap to High
Law and Hydrogen.
Channel Rise is a very flashy looker.
When listed in Inglis’s catalogue for
the 1950 Sydney yearling sales, at
which he was purchased for the
modest figure of 600 guineas, he was
described as a brown colt; now the
racebooks refer to him as “brown or
black.” At the distance most race-
goers sight him he looks a fine glossy
black with the striking contrast of a
prominent white blaze and three long
white socks. Cut on somewhat fine
lines (though with no suggestion of
delicacy), he is a tallish colt in pro-
portion to his short-coupled back.
Channel Rise is a son of Channel
Swell-Heiress. It is rather odd, and
doubtless most pleasing for those con-
nected with the late Percy Miller’s
Kia-Ora Stud (N.S.W.), that the win-
ner of the Derby should have turned
up in a Channel Swell colt bred at
Kia-Ora. The early Derby favorite
had been the Sires’ Produce and
Champagne Stakes winner Ocean
Bound, whose failure to train-on as
a Derby colt had seemed to support
the notion that progeny of Channel
Swell would not stay. Nevertheless
it is most probable that Channel Rise
derives his staying ability from the
dam’s side of his pedigree, which is
liberally sprinkled with suggestions of
stamina, including an infusion of the
Carbine blood. Channel Swell was a
well-performed horse in England,
notching up a string of wins and
minor placings under thumping big
weights, but he was essentially a
sprinter.
Since he started at 9 to 4 on, it is
unlikely that Hydrogen’s failure really
inconvenienced many of the run of
small punters. However, Derby
favorites have such a habit of coming
unstuck that it is worth looking to
see if any lesson is to be gleaned
from this year’s case. Two possibly
pertinent observations can be made.
One is that when it comes to assess-
ing chances in the AJ.C. Derby, form
students actually have very little to
guide them. What they have is not
concrete evidence of stamina, but a
mere implication of stamina, based
on performances, for the most part,
over much shorter distances. By way
of Derby trials there are only the
9-furlongs Canterbury Guineas and
the 10-furlongs Rosehill Guineas, both
of which have pretty woeful records
as pointers to Derby prospects. Other
three-year-old events preceding the
Derby are over shorter trips, and it
is seldom that what are considered
to be the leading Derby candidates
tackle anything outside of these events
unless it be a w.-f.-a. race, such as
the 9-furlongs Chelmsford Stakes. By
way of contrast, the English racing
calendar offers a very different pic-
ture. Apart from the Two Thousand
Guineas, the Irish Two Thousand
Guineas and a swag of 10-furlongs
races such as the Sandown Park
Trial, Classic Trial Stakes, Druid
Stakes, Royal Standard Stakes and
Newmarket Stakes, there are preced-
ing the Derby the Dee Stakes and
Derby Trial Stakes, both over the
actual Derby distance, and also the
Chester Vase of 13 furlongs.
The other, and in some ways allied,
question which presents is whether
some of these strongly-fancied Derby
colts who miss out are really lacking
in actual inbred stamina, or, rather,
lack sufficient hard racing experience
to fit them for the gruelling Derby
test. Of course the trainer is the
best judge of this. Hydrogen, for
instance, has been a difficult fellow
to train, and his trainer was, under-
standably, very reluctant to risk over-
racing him. Hydrogen had only three
runs in preparation for the Derby.
He won twice against fellow three-
year-olds at level weights over
journeys of 7 furlongs and 10 fur-
longs. Betweentimes he was comfort-
ably beaten over 9 furlongs by Delta,
who, under the w.-f.-a. scale, was
conceding 231 b. Channel Rise, on
the other hand, has been in training,
and racing regularly, since he won,
first-up, the first race run at the re-
opening, on May 30, of the Claren-
don (N.S.W.) course, where he is
trained. Channel Rise had, prior to
the Derby, nine starts without any
appreciable let-up, and at the last
two, on the two successive Saturdays
immediately preceding the classic, he
tackled all ages over 10 furlongs
under Mixed Stakes conditions. Pos-
sibly Channel Rise’s trainer, W. W.
Chaffe, Jun., as the third generation
of training Chaffes, has inherited a
leaning towards “old-fashioned pre-
paration” methods, and it cannot be
denied they have brought him success.
Trizami, too, had a long and solid
preparation for the Derby. His record
comprised eight runs, dating back to
early April, without anything of the
lengthy let-up enjoyed by Hydrogen
between running in the Sires’ Produce
Stakes in March and the Hobartville
Stakes five months later. And Tri-
zami, too, tackled open company,
finishing third in the Chelmsford
Stakes and second, under open handi-
cap conditions, in a Rosehill Flying.
On the other hand the other Derby
placegetter, Montana, had much the
same preparation as Hydrogen; a
five-months break after the autumn
meeting, then three runs by way of
readying for the Derby; consistent,
but unlucky, Montana tackled the
Hobartville and both Guineas, and was
placed in all three.
Reverting to Trizami, his run really
impressed in that he did all the
bullocking, and then, after seeming
to weaken, came again at the finish
when one had thought him quite
done with. By Nizami out of an
Oaks winner whose granddam was
also a winner of the fillies’ classic,
Trizami is bred to be an outstanding
stayer, and bis Derby run suggested
that he is one. Yet it is surprising
how many people, including people
from whom one might expect better
judgment, are hesitant to admit stay-
ing ability in progeny of Nizami until
the said progeny have picked up an
odd Melbourne Cup or something of
the like. Casting back, we recall
Hiraji’s jockey expressing grave
doubts as to his qualifications as a
stayer after finishing second on him
in the Hotham a few days prior to
his winning the Melbourne Cup. Then
there was Grey Boots; before he won
the Doncaster it was declared he
wouldn’t see out a mile, and before
he won the Caulfield Cup there were
still many prepared to doubt him at
12 furlongs. Only a few weeks
ago present writer heard Trizami’s
Derby prospects unequivocally dis-
missed by a gentleman who happens
to have in his possession one of the
best proven stayers of Nizami’s get.
And after his excellent Derby show-
ing Trizami’s jockey was credited with
saying that the colt lacked stamina.
The Epsom provided two outstand-
ing examples of something many
punters seem never to learn: the vast
difference between w.-f.-a. and open-
handicap form. San Domenico was
heavily backed for the Epsom on the
strength of three successive w.-f.-a.
victories, and he ran just as he had
run on several previous occasions in
big handicaps; a good, honest plug-
ging effort to just make the first half-
dozen. On the other hand the New
Zealander Davey Jones demonstrated
precisely the same thing in reverse.
When Epsom weights were first issued
he was installed favorite in the light
of the very promising form he had
shown in the couple of handicap runs
he had had in Australia. Since then,
however, he had dropped right out
of favor because of two just-moderate
showings (placed both times) at
w.-f.-a. and one poor effort in a
handicap—a Quality handicap. Start-
ing at 14 to 1 on Saturday, after
20 to 1 had been available, Davey
Jones showed his real ability as a
handicap performer with a brilliant
win over rank outsider Rinkeno.
Consistent Golden Wedge finished
third, and equally consistent, but on
this occasion slightly overweighted,
Oversight, fourth. The favorite,
French Cavalier, looked to have the
race in his keeping with two fur-
longs to go, but had the bad luck to
break a leg, and was later destroyed.
This page’s selection, Humming Top,
was another who broke down; what
happened to him was not quite clear,
but Munro pulled him up to just
walk past the post, and he looked a
badly-distressed horse.
Four-year-old Davey Jones is a
son of two imported horses (Neptune-
Celebrity), and he is trained by Mc-
Carten. In all but one of his previous
Australian runs he had been ridden by
W. Cook, but on Saturday the Mel-
bourne rider Williamson, who last
year won the Epsom on Achilles,
switched to Davey Jones, while Cook
rode Achilles. Davey Jones has now
had seven starts in Australia, and
only once been unplaced. He has
contested two w.-f.-a. events and
two Quality Handicaps; in three runs
in open handicaps his record is
second, beaten a head, in the Don-
caster; third, beaten less than two
lengths, in the Doomben Ten Thou-
sand; and first in the Epsom.
The new crop of two-year-olds
made their first appearance in the
Breeders’ Plate, and one of those very
easy wins which one is accustomed
to seeing in Breeders’ Plates was
registered by Joy Lad (A. Ward). A
son of the Midday Sun horse Nice
Day, and out of the imported mare
All Joy, Joy Lad led nearly all
the way to win from Lucky Tea, a
son of Sea Tonic, and Prince Dakhil,
who is by A 1 Dakhil. Blond Val, who
was this page’s stab at the unknown,
was a trifle green, but when he finally
found himself he finished on well to
be fourth; he’ll do better.
* * * *
With one notable exception results
at Saturday’s Moonee Valley meeting
didn’t inspire much comment other
than of a sulphurous nature; the
favorites were beaten in every race.
However, the Friar’s Fancy colt
Friar’s Hope (E. Preston) did run an
excellent Derby trial in winning the
mile Moonee Valley Stakes (a special-
weights afiair for three-year-olds),
and, in view of the upsets to Sydney
three-year-old form jn Saturday’s
A.J.C. Derby, one is much inclined
to look searchingly among the Vic-
torian colts for a prospective Vic-
toria Derby winner. Of course, at
the same time, it must be noted that
Shoreham, the only Melbourne colt
who did go north for the A.J.C.
classic, failed dismally.
Trained by H. Wolters, who won
the two Derbies last yeaf with Alister,
Friar’s Hope on Saturday won very
easily from Diplomacy, El Sovino and
a field of also-rans that included
Usage, Beau Silhouette, Jana, Blue
Beggar, National Hope and Quite
Talk. Friar’s Hope looks an excel-
lent Derby type, and the manner in
which he runs his races should
enable him to cope with any tactics
the opposition might adopt in the
classic; he has the ability to main-
tain a handy position all the way,
with plenty up his sleeve for a strong
finishing burst.
Easiest winner of the day at the
Valley was the four-year-old Royal
Brocade (S. Ralph), who earned him-
self admission to the ever-growing
list of “Cup” horses with a six-lengths
victory over favorite Regent King and
the grey Durham in the 10-furlongs
Quality Handicap. Quite a good
effort on the winner’s part, but our
money will still be for Durham over
a longer trip.

Large lumps of the Victorian
Western District population invaded
Melbourne on Saturday to see Gee-
long, the only country team in the
V.F.L., win the premiership from
Essendon by 11.15 to 10.10. While
the big match was on a second match
was played between police and a
crowd trying to get in, the M.C.G.
gates having been closed at 12.30
p.m. with just over 84,000 inside.
One account reckons another 20,000
got through the police cordons, and,
inside the ground, thousands more
surged over the fence on to the boun-
dary lines. Geelong got away well,
and their 3.8 to 1.0 lead in the first
quarter would have been more but
for hurried kicking. Essendon got
going then, and had 6.2 to 4.10 at
half-time. In the third, Geelong
clapped on the pace and ran the
Dons into the ground to pile up 5.3
to two points, starting the last with
a lead of 3.9. Essendon pulled this
down in the last, but Geelong out-
stayed them, and were 11 points up
at the end.
All round Geelong has had a great
season. The team showed early form
in the competition, and went to the
top about half-way through the sea-
son, was displaced for one week only,
and finished minor premiers before
defeating Collingwood and Essendon
in the finals. The Geelong star for-
ward, G. Goninon, headed the list of
goal-getters with 86 and B. Smith, a
back man, won the Brownlow medal
for best and fairest player.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Keeping Up the Numbers.
“R.N.”: Under average Aus-
tralian conditions a Merino ewe
must lamb five times before she
produces her own replacement
in the flock, says the C.5.1.R.0.
This statement is based on a
careful analysis of the normal
breeding performance of Aus-
tralian Merinos. As ram and
ewe lambs are produced in
about equal proportions, two
matings must be allowed to en-
sure that on the average a ewe
lamb will be born.
However, as the overall lamb-
marking figures for the Com-
monwealth average only about
60 per cent, and death rates
amount to about 10 per cent,
between marking and selection,
it follows that each ewe annually
only produces on the average
0.27 ewe lambs which survive to
selection age. Consequently,
each ewe will need to lamb
approximately four times before
she bears a lamb to replace her-
self.
This is not the whole story.
During the period involved in
these four lambings it is
estimated that at least 5 per cent,
of the original ewes will die each
year from various causes and
these losses mean that some of
the flock must lamb five times
to provide sufficient ewe replace-
ments to maintain flock
numbers, whilst a sixth lambing
will be necessary if any appreci-
able culling is to be done.
This shows how low marking
percentages, early lamb losses,
and natural mortality of ewes
cause the culling programme on
so many properties to be
severely restricted or abandoned
entirely in order to maintain
flock numbers, although as an
alternative the owner may
continue to breed from old ewes
of less productive ages.
A C.5.1.R.0. survey shows
that the lambing percentage of
ewes rises steeply between the
ages of two and three years, and
continues to rise up to six years,
but thereafter declines. Pro-
duction of greasy wool, however,
invariably declines sharply in
ewes after three years of age,
and the fact that this decline is
less marked in dry ewes in-
dicates that it is basically due
to the effect of lactation.
Pastures and Lambs.
“Crossbred”: Although some
lamb-raisers changed to wool-
production when wool prices
rose, their numbers were com-
paratively few, and the swing to
lambs in the past decade or two
is not likely to be arrested.
In N.S.W. during the past ten
years the percentage of Merinos
has fallen from 84 to 75. Great-
est fall occurred on the western
slopes—78 to 66 per cent.
A change to lamb-raising in-
evitably accompanies improve-
ment of pastures. Sown pas-
tures, especially when fertilised,
raise the nutritive value, particu-
larly the protein content, con-
siderably above that of natural
pasture, and such feed is more
efficiently and more economi-
cally used for the production of
meat and wool by crossbred
sheep than by Merinos.
In the colder parts of the table-
lands, where pasture-improve-
ment is much less, the decline in
Merinos has been only from
about 95 to about 81 per cent.
Beats the Hoe.
“Foamar”: Anyone who has
used hoe or slasher on burrs,
blackberry, lantana, boxthorn
and the rest of them knows that
at best they’ve achieved a severe
pruning. Now what is called the
“paragun” method, using oil-
emulsified spray with the latest
ingredients, kills the whole thing
right down to the roots and de-
vitalises the seeds.
The stuff is deadly to trees,
weeds, flowers, vegetables,
scrubs, bushes, cereals, etc., but
not to grass, which is impervious
to it. A light spray of the
foliage, a shot on the stem or
trunk and it’s goodnight for the
victim, which is why care must
be used.
The same equipment, using a
special blowfly oil, is working
wonders on fly-struck sheep.
Equipment costs £l5, the
spraying oil 17s, 6d. a gallon-
enough for 1000 sheep or up to
1200 sq. ft. of area for weeds.
Saving in time and labor is
enormous, and, with weeds, the
kill is permanent.
The Farm Workshop.
“A-Jay”: A we 1 l-lighted
building with 300 to 400 square
feet of concrete floor space and
a 9ft. stud should prove
adequate for the average
mechanised farm. More space
and up to 12ft. stud may be re-
quired where large header

ment of hand tools.
Crofton Weed*.
Clem Lack: Crofton weed,
greatest menace to Queensland’s
coastal grassland pastures since
prickly-pear, is to be attacked in
the same way as was pear—by
insects. Importation from
Hawaii of the stem gall-fly,
which feeds on crofton weed,
will depend on results of tests
of the feeding habits of the fly.
A. P. Dodd, of Queensland
Land’s Department, is to study
the fly in Honolulu.
Crofton weed spreads with
terrifying rapidity. The se*d is
windborne and in some places
the weed has grown to a height
of eight feet, actually choking
lantana growth.
Dodd was principally re-
sponsible for the eradication of
prickly-pear. After pioneering
work by the late Henry Tryon,
Dodd, then in charge of the
Commonwealth Prickly Pear
Commission’s laboratories at
Sherwood, visited South
America. His mission resulted
in the successful introduction of
the cactoblastis into Queensland
in the egg stage. As a result
a territory as large as Ireland
was reclaimed from pear.
Wool Prices.
“Graz”; Wool prices took a
dive in September, and though
still at profitable levels a further
decline would seriously affect the
country’s economy. Production
costs have increased manyfold ;
shearing rates have risen from
435. to £7 145., woolpacks from
4s. sd. to 295. 6d. proposed for
next season, netting from £4 ss.
to £lB 10s. per 100 yd. coil, fenc-
ing from £l3O to £4OO per mile,
and rail freights have nearly
doubled, with further rises pend-
ing.
The healthiest thing that could
happen would be for prices to
stabilise round about the Sep-
tember levels for the rest of the
“Why the necklace, Strawb?”
season. Most woolgrowing
properties are not in good order,
particularly in regard to fencing
and rabbit-i nfestation. In
N.S.W. the accommodation pro-
visions for rural workers are very
stiff, and the shortage of mate-
rials and building labor is worse
than ever. Wages for station
hands has gone up from £3 3s.
in the early war years to over
£ll.
The wool loading added to
shearing rates and the wages of
all pastoral workers comes up
for review in March, when, on
present wool prices, it will cer-
tainly be lowered. It will be six
months before woolgrowers are
likely to benefit from any de-
cline in production costs. A
sharp increase in the output of
Australian-made wire-netting,
fencihg-wire, steel posts, galvan-
ised-iron and water piping, all
of which have been sold at a
reasonable price when obtain-
able, would benefit all hands.
Nutritive Ratio.
“Hortus”: It is worked out
in this manner: We know that
protein, carbohydrates and fats
are the essential nutrients or
digestible ingredients in a food
ration or a single food material.
The proportion of protein to the
fats and carbohydrates in a food
is a quick indication of the value
of that food in a ration. This
is the nutritive ratio, which is
the ratio of the amount of pro-
tein (digestible) in a given feed-
ing material to the amount of
digestible carbohydrates and
fat it contains. Fats yield 2\
times as much heat in the body
as carbohydrates. To find the
nutritive ratio, then, the amount
of digestible fat is multiplied by
2|. This product is added to the
total quantity of digestible
carbohydrates. This sum,
divided by the digestible protein,
gives the nutritive ratio.
For example, the digestible in-
gredients of corn are set down
as follows: protein, 7.14 per
cent.; carbohydrates, 66.12 per
cent.; fat, 4.97 per cent. To
find the nutritive ratio of corn
we multiply the fat content
(4.97 per cent.) by 2\. The
answer is 11.18. Addihg this to
the carbohydrates, 66.12 plus
11.18, we have 77.30. Divide
the latter by the digestible pro-
tein (7.14 per cent.) and we get
10.8. Therefore the nutritive
ratio of corn is one to 10.8 or
1:10.8.
A Saddle-pad.
“A.W.”: These days, when it
is so hard to get a saddle
counterlined, there is a cheap
and effective method to save
your horse a sore back.
Make a hair-pad the full size
of the lining on the saddle. To
do this get a sugarbag or other
light material to hold the hair
in position till it sets. Lay the
hair evenly inside, place under
the saddle and ride on it a
couple of days till it sets down.
If you want the pad thicker add
more hair. Lay the hair on
evenly, teasing out any lumps
or knots.
After the hair has set properly
remove the outside covering and
cut the pad down the centre.
Then tack the split pad on to
the panel, securing front and
back and to the side dees. This
will last indefinitely, as you can
take it off and wash it, fluff it up,
and put it back, and it’s as good
as new.
Preserving Eggs.
“Sarina”; Waterglass is better
than anything else for preserv-
ing eggs, but it has been off the
market lately (B. 15/8/’5l).
Melted paraffin-wax smeared
over the eggs works fairly well,
but before treatment the eggs
should be wiped with a rag
dipped in chloroform. The
chloroform gets into the pores
of the eggshell and kills the
decay-causing bacteria or fungi
that invade eggs as soon as they
are laid.
In overseas experiments it was
found that freshly-laid eggs re-
mained in perfect condition for
months after being momentarily
dipped in a fast-boiling boric-
acid solution. The boric-acid was
regarded as a germ-killer, and
the immersion served to “cook”
a narrow band of albumen in the
egg. This toughened egg-white,
it was claimed, served to keep
fresh bacteria out.
Ram Fertility.
“Archaps”: Dr. Neil Yeates,
B.Agr.Sc., Physiology School,
Queensland University, is accu-
mulating data which point to
April being the peak breeding
month for rams under Queens-
land conditions. Dr. Yeates is
working on an important dis-
covery, made at Cambridge Uni-
versity, relating to male fertility.
Dr. Yeates stated that Dr. T.
Mann (Cambridge) had, through
his semen studies, given a yard-
stick for measuring the male
hormone at any period of the
year. He had discovered that
the sugar fructose—rare in
animal tissues generally —was
plentiful in normal semen and
was directly related to the level
of male hormone. With this in
mind he (Dr. Yeates) had under-
taken a study of four rams at
Queensland University penned
under the same breeding condi-
tions.
While it was premature to
arrive at any definite conclusion,
especially with so few animaJs
of only one breed, there was
strong reason to feel that April
was probably the month of
greatest activity in the ram.
Skeleton-weed.
“Danny”: Skeleton-weed is
aptly named. Its long, branch-
ing, almost leafless stems dry
out in autumn to form a twisted,
stringy mass. A strong grower,
it easily beats cultivated crops
and will completely take over a
wheat paddock in a few years.
Once land is badly infested it
is generally useless to attempt
to crop again until the weed has
been controlled. It makes culti-
vation a trial, and during harvest
results in choked knife blades,
combs, elevators, sieves atod
drums. Chopped pieces of the
weed reduce the grain sample.
Some growers have had cause
to thank skeleton-weed when
other summer fodder has been
scarce and dear. Sheep do well
on it, despite the black noses
they get. In the Riverina, since
wool went up, sheep are being
turned in wholesale on to former
wheatland. But when the weed
dies out in autumn it is valueless
as fodder, and very little forage
is then available till next spring.
Control is difficult. Experi-
ments have indicated that long
spells under lucerne will even-
tually beat the weed—so will
sub-clover, but both methods
take time. Promise has been
shown in the new hormone
weed-killers, which make the
plant look very sick without
affecting the crop—but the cost
is prohibitive. Unless a quick
method is found, skeleton-weed
will continue to be a major
cause of diminishing wheat
yields.
For Protein Lack.
“Agric”: The problem of
substituting a portion of the pro-
tein used in feeding ruminants
by urea —a rather simple chemi-
cal compound which can be pro-
duced artificially—was discussed
at the Brisbane Science Con-
gress. It was suggested even in
1891 that ruminants might be
able to derive protein from non-
protein nitrogenous substances,
such as urea, through the propa-
gation of bacteria in the rumen.
Dr. A. W. Peirce said there
were gaps still to be filled-in in
the knowledge of the conditions
necessary for optimal conversion
of urea to protein, but recent ex-
periments with pen-sheep showed
that the minimum amount oi
starch which would bring about
increased wool productfon was

This big five-foot cylinder is the heart
of the ALL-CROP Harvester. The long
spiralled rubber-faced cylinder bars
reduce crackage and provide ample
shelling capacity for the heaviest of
crops.
Rubber-against-rubber shell-
ing contacts in the ALL-
CROP Harvester give a
natural shelling action, just as
you rub out a hr°d of grain
in the palm of your band.
The crop falls oa a wide,
rubberised draper and rides
straight to the full-width,
spiral bar cylinder in a thin
stream just as it greV in the
field. Rubber-cushioned
cylinder bars rub out the
grain or seeds against rubber
concaves.
This same gentle handling of
over 100 grains, seeds and
beans makes the All-Crop
what it is . . . truly an
ALL-CROP Harvester.

Kikuyu in the North.
“Tablelander”; “Bill Ding”
(B. 5/9/’5l) surely must be con-
fusing some other grass with
kikuyu when he uses such terms
as “pest grass,” “soil clutterer”
and “costly nuisance.” Our ex-
perience on the southern end of
the Atherton Tableland (N.Q.) is
that it is our standby for most
of the year.
If we had to rely on paspalum,
for at least half the year, our
returns would be very low. I
have 50 per cent, of my farm
under kikuyu and have had an
average production over the past
two years of I,llb. of butterfat
per day per cow off pasture. It
has been proved by analysis and
experience that young succulent
kikuyu is little, if any, inferior
to lucerne as a milk producer.
Admittedly it is a prolific
grower, and may be a source of
trouble near cultivation, but as
a pasture grass it has few rivals
where the soil is suitable.
Sorghum for Cows.
“C.S.”: Sorghum sown in late
December or January and
allowed to grow until frosts
occur will retain its sappiness
and sweetness until late July.
When cut and chaffed it supplies
an excellent bulk ration during
late autumn and early winter.
Farmers with silage on hand
need not open up their silos
until the sorghum is finished,
and thus can make their fodder
reserves extend over a longer
period than if sorghum was not
grown. Sorghum for use in this
wise should be sown in rows, not
broadcast, for row-sorghum
grows thicker in the stalk and
retains its moisture well,
whereas broadcast-sorghum de-
velops a thin stalk and dries out
fairly rapidly.
All dairyfarmers could grow
an area of two to four acres of
sorghum, depending on the size
of the herd, even if they have
no silos, so as to have bulk
fodder available when no other
annual grazing crop is giving
feed and when the pastures are
short.
A mixture of chaffed sorghum,
lucerne hay and maize grain
gives a very good winter ration
for milch cattle. In areas where
cow cane grows it can be used in
a similar manner to sweet
sorghum.
Native Cats.
“Sarina”: Australia wouldn’t
lose if the native cat became
extinct (B. 27/6/’5l). All it
does is prey on native birds—
when it is not entering fowl-
houses and destroying chickens
—sometimes even grown fowls.
It is a dirty, destructive and
vicious creature, when, as
frequently happens, it decides
to winter in a house. It’s a pity
those nature-lovers who are
afraid that this worthless pest
will vanish don’t get better
acquainted with it.
Spring-scouring.
“Koo-wee-rup”: It’s common
in cattle when pastures are lush
in early spring. Most Gipps-
land (Vic.) farmers are familiar
with it. It usually clears up as
summer advances, but recurs the
following spring. Animals
affected are certain to be
unthrifty.
The condition is always worst
when cattle have been pastured
on affected properties for several
seasons. On such land it be-
comes hard to raise young
cattle ; they become susceptible
to worms.
Tests in New Zealand revealed
that top-dressing pastures with
powdered bluestone, at the rate
of 51b. per acre, prevented the
trouble. Alternatively, bluestone
as a drench or lick is effective.
For Beekeepers.
“Pip Tok”: A warning to
beekeepers by Westralian Agri-
cultural Department says that
the codlin-moth has found a
new way of invading the State.
The department has just been
at considerable expense in
eradicating the moth from two
important apple-growing dis-
tricts in the south-west, but
there is still the danger that
codlin-moth larvae might be
carried west in beehives or
material for making hives from
other States. There is the possi-
bility that hives kept near in-
fested apple-, quince- and pear-
trees may contain the larwe, be-
cause the codlin-moth has a
nasty habit of overwintering or
pupating in any material near
the trees it has infested.
Hints for the Farm.
“Big Billy”: At least once a
year use a fork to loosen
between herbaceous plants,
shrubs and roses. Keep handle
low so that tines don’t go deeply
into the soil, which should be left
as lumpy as possible. This
practice, with regular use of the
hoe, will ensure a soil of a fine
crumbly texture.
“C.A.A.”: A successful
fertiliser mixture for potatoes is
2cwt. of sulphate of ammonia,
3cwt. of dried blood, 3cwt. of
blood-and-bone, 7cwt. of bone-
dust, 4cwt. of super, 3cwt. of
muriate or sulphate of potash.
This should be applied at 20-25
cwt. per acre and will get best
results from land under constant
vegetable cropping.
“Billjim”: To control woolly
aphis on apple-trees spray with
red oil one in 20. This must be
applied at high pressure to blow
away protective covering of the
waxy threads of the pest. In
the home garden use a paint
brush dipped in sump oil or
methylated spirit.
“Bass”; When the miniature
pumpkin is seen as a bulb at the
base of the dead flower wait
a few days, then nip off the end
of the runner from which it is
growing. If you start nipping
before that, the chances are the
flowers won’t set, the sap going
instead to making new foliage.
“Sarina”: Phaseolus lathy-
roides (Phaley-bean) has little
fodder value, although it is a
splendid legume for long-term
cover cropping (B. 15/11/’5O).
The seed is small, but the plant,
half creeper and half bush,
grows to 7ft., and is perennial
in the wet coastal districts of
Queensland. The bean is poison-
ous to stock. My experience is
that neither horses nor cattle
will eat it, but stock on flogged-
out pastures might act differ-
ently.
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
Weakening of southern sunspots occurs as they reach
their normal active position, and so far there is not much
definite sign of the cyclical change of September, 1880, now
due to be repeated on the main cycle. However, the change
is due and may have appeared by the time this forecast is
published. The change, when it comes, should give good
rams over the greater part of Eastern Australia south of
the tropics, but until then showery conditions are likely to
prevail over the southern areas of the continent.

pictures in Sydney and saw, and
was very much delighted with,
the likenesses. He thought the
children’s very pretty. I think he
wrote to you while he was away,
but I fancy it was from Rock-
hampton, before he got the
parcel. The drays were to have
come up before this, but we
have had nearly a week of rainy
weather, which has made the
roads heavy and swollen the
creeks and rivers so that they
have been impassable! It
requires a great deal of patience
to get things up here.
Annie has just made a pleas-
ing discovery in the garden. We
have a kitchen garden down by
the creek where things are begin-
ning to grow now that the hot
weather is over. Well, as there
was no work for Methuselah,
as the lame old Irishman I was
telling you of is generally called,
he was yesterday set to dig. Part
of the garden is covered with a
thick crop of weeds. She and
Mr. Hedgeland, taking a stroll
thither in the evening, discovered
that he had rooted out all the
watermelon vines, on which the
fruit was jUst ripening, a goodly
patch of Indian com and two
pines out of the three that
survived the summer drought!
Indignation is wasted upon him,
as he only opens his mouth
wider and ejaculates “Sure!” but
it really is very provoking.
April 28. Biddulph is come
back at last and has brought
your letter of January 23. I am
glad you received all our
Exmoor letters safely. I cannot
say we have anything to com-
plain of in the postal line. I
do not think, a letter has ever
been lost on either side since
we have been out here. 1 am
glad we gave you a pleasant
impression of Exmoor. It is
not pleasanter than the reality,
as I can still say after nearly
eight months here. The unavoid-
able “crooks in the lot” are too
small to mention, and a lovely
climate, easy life and good
health are no small elements of
happiness.
I like your picture of home
life, to know exactly what you
are all doing just when you are
writing.
Biddulph, Messrs. Devlm,
Taylor, Julian and Palmer came
home yesterday afternoon. They
had been detained for a week
on the other side of the Broken
River by a heavy flood, which
swept away the canoes and
entirely prevented horses from
crossing. There they had to wait
when every moment was
precious to Biddulph ; as it is he
has just this one day to settle
everything at home. Men have
to be dismissed and engaged, the
woolshed and paddock to be
arranged about and he is nearly
distracted. As it was, the party
crossed by swimming beside
their horses.

{To be continued next week.)
a sliding halt. He hit the ground
on the run, mashie in hand.
HP HE first dog leaped high as
* Jimmy reached the door of
the whipstick-room. The boy
paused, and hit the dog squarely
on the head as it came. The
second dog was too close and
Jimmy had a momentary glimpse
of an open mouth as the dog hit
him.
Man and dog hit the ground
with terrific force, the dog, mad
with excitement, looking for the
throat. Jimmy got his forearm
across as the dog lunged in.
Then suddenly there was no dog
at all, and, looking up, Jimmy
saw the great back leg rip down-
wards and the dog dropped to
the ground.
Nightmarch turned almost
slowly, his eyes red with fighting
madness, and looked at the boy.
Jimmy lay still —and saved his
life.
The big old-man Too crossed
the room in a single hop, pushed
his head through the whipsticks,
hopped again and was gone. The
only sound of his passing was
the dry rattle of the straight,
thin tea-trees.
I IMMY GAITER got to his
feet and walked outside.
The hunters were pulling their
horses to a halt in front of him.
Fifteen pairs of eyes watched
him roll the sleeve back to his
elbow and saw the red wounds
the dog’s teeth had made.
The initial shock of the en-
counter was wearing off and
Jimmy felt better. “Who,” he
said quietly, “organised this
hunt?”
“I did, you dog-killin’ .”
The boy’s blood raced to his
head as he looked at the man.
It was Blackwell. A big fellow
now ; the bully boy grown up.
The old fear came unex-
pectedly, tying his guts in a
small knot. The old fear of get-
ting another belting from
Blackwell, like the hidings Black-
well used to give him every few
days, for years when they were
at school.
With a clatter of hooves Paddy
and Doll joined the end of the
line. “Who gave you the O.K.
to hunt on the station?” Young
Gaiter’s voice was dry.
Blackwell snarled. “Never
mind about that. Half we get
goes to the Red Cross. We hunt
all over.”
Then, for no reason, the fear
was gone. A wild exultation
took its place.
Blackwell went on. “And
what about me dog? We all
saw you kill him.”
The man near Blackwell
leaned over his saddle and said
softly, “And what about my dog,
sport? Where’s he, too?”
Jimmy recognised Dansy, an-
other member of the Blackwell
mob.
He grinned and jerked his
thumb towards the whipstick-
room behind him. “He’s dead,
too ; the ’roo got him.”
Blackwell glanced at his mate.
“I think this boyoh is too smart.
I think we should do something
about this feller.”
Jimmy parodied an Army
verse.
And there was Mrs. Blackwell’s
boy,
A lad of about twenty-four,
Huntin’ ’roos on the Karalong,
Doin’ his bit for the war.
Might as well get him properly
mad; sometimes angry people
made mistakes. Paddy laughed
out loud. Blackwell’s face was
red clear back to the ears. He
and Dansy dismounted and
moved in.
Paddy hooked Doll’s reins
over a twig; in two strides he
was at Jimmy’s side. “Don’t
mind his mate, son, he won’t
do nothin’.” He moved in front
of Dansy, the murderous mashie
gripped in his right hand. “Git
back on y’r horse.”
Dansy stopped and Paddy hit
him with a straight left full in
the face. The man went down.
BLACKWELL came steadily
on. When he was a short
two yards from Jimmy he
rushed, as Jimmy knew he
would. The boy drove his left
hand into the man’s broad
stomach and crossed with a hard
right below the heart.
Blackwell said “whoosh” as
the wind was forced from his
body. He stood half-doubled
up, trying for air. Jimmy hit
him twice in the face, straight
left and right cross. It was fruit
off the sideboard. Blackwell
blew some teeth through his cut
lips. He said, “I’ll kill you now,
Gaiter.” He lunged in swinging.
Jimmy’s left hand found the
nose and felt the bones give,
and ran into a haymaking right.
It took him on the chest and
knocked him down. As Black-
well dived the boy rolled clear
and stood up.
Paddy said “Snipe him, mate.
Don’t mix it; he’s too big.”
The big man was blowing. He
walked in with his hands down.
Jimmy feinted, buried his fist in
the soft belly and stood clear.
As Blackwell turned he hit him
twice, faded, and twice again.
He knew he’d won then.
Blackwell was used to dishing it
out, not taking it. The fear was
in his eyes. They moved in
again, but it was one-sided now.
Then Blackwell, stooped and
came up with Jimmy’s mashie.
The boy grinned. The first
thing an unarmed-combat in-
structor teaches a rookie is how
to disarm a man swinging a
bottle. He barred Blackwell’s
arm with his left forearm as it
came down, twisted the wrist
with his right hand and forced
the elbow upward with his left.
Blackwell hit the ground hard
with his face. Reaching down
Jimmy took a firm grip of the
man’s hair and yanked him
screaming to his feet With
deadly efficiency he proceeded to
change the topography of Black-
well’s face. The man turned and
ran blindly for his horse.
Paddy said to the watching
men. “Maybe there’s a couple
more want to argue?” No one
spoke.
Jimmy said “Look, you blokes,
helping the Red Cross is good,
but not when it interferes with
a man’s livelihood. Paddy here
does it for a living. All right?”
The men said, “Yair, sure, we
didn’t know. Sorry t’ bother
you.” They moved off in a
bunch, calling to their dogs.
PADDY watched them.
“They’re all right, them
fellers. They was badly led,
that’s all.”
Jimmy rolled a cigarette and
handed the makings to Paddy.
He smiled. “We still haven’t
got old Nightmarch.”
Paddy hawked and spat. “How
the hell are we going to if you
go rushin’ round savin’ his life
all the time?”
“I’m not too sure, Pat, just
who saved who. Things got a
bit mixed up in there.” Jimmy
nodded to the tea-tree room.
“I think we both did a bit of
lifesavin’,”
As they rode home Paddy
said, “I’ll get him one day, that
big aster. One day I’ll tack his
hide to a tree.”
Jimmy said “Yair.” He
doubted it.
Come to that, Paddy doubted
it, too. He said, “Doff, damn
you, walk /”

One in three Australian families, on the average,
rely on the A.M.P. The A.M.P. has earned this
trust by service; service given in full measure for
over a century because the A.M.P. is, and always
has been, a wholly mutual society. There are no
shareholders, and all surplus earned is returned in
full to policyholders. Perhaps that is one of the
reasons why the Australian Mutual Provident

(1) How many gallons of Australian
wine are consumed in Australia each
year? (2) The quantity exported
annually? (3) What are the highest
and lowest alcohol contents of Aus-
tralian wines ? (4) What is the alcohol
content of the Vin Ordinaire of
France ?
(1) The quantity of Australian forti-
fied wine (sherry, port and the like)
withdrawn from bond for home con-
sumption during the year ending June
30, 1950, was 11,396,402 gallons.
Figures for unfortified wine (table
wine) are not available, but amount
to approximately 1,000,000 gallons.
(2) The export of wine from Australia
for the year ended June 30, 1950,
amounted to 1,101,834 gallons. (3)
The alcoholic strength of Australian
fortified wines ranges from 29 p.c.
proof spirit to 35 p.c. proof spirit
(16£ p.c. to 20 p.c. absolute alcohol).
The alcoholic strength of unfortified
wines ranges from 17 p.c. proof spirit
to 24 p.c. proof spirit (10 p.c. to
14 p.c. absolute alcohol). (4) The
alcoholic content of the French Vin
Ordinaire ranges from 16 p.c. to
18 p.c, proof spirit (approximately
10 p.c. absolute alcohol). Other
French wines are often higher in
alcoholic content.
* * * *
Which is correct, “forebear” or
“forbear”; and what is the ruling as ■
to whether such words should be
spelt with or without an “e” ?
“Forebear” and “forbear” are two
different words —the former, a noun,
means an ancestor; the latter, a verb,
means to abstain from or be patient
with. The prefix “for” derives from
the Anglo-Saxon, and has the signifi-
cance of out, off, apart, prohibition,
abstention or neglect. Examples are
forbid, forgive, forget, forgo (to go
without), forfend (to fend off).
“Fore” prefixed to a word has the
significance of before or at or near
the front —forebear (one who has been
before), forego (to precede or go
before), foretell (to predict). There
are one or two exceptions, foreclose,
for instance, which by derivation and
meaning should not have its first
“e,” but has been given the other
prefix. Some writers, it should be
added, prefer “forbear” for ancestor
as well as for “abstain,” but most
grammatical authorities recommend
that a distinction be kept.
* * * *
What kind of nest does the honey-
eater build, and what color egg does
it lay?
The nests are open, cup-shaped
structures, placed in trees or bushes —
usually in forks, but sometimes sus-
pended by the rims. They are
variously composed of grass or bark,
often interwoven with cobwebs, and
lined with finer materials, hair or
wood. The eggs, though sometimes
white, are more usually pink or buff
in ground-color, and are almost
invariably spotted with reddish-brown
or grey.
* * * *
What kind of fish are hair-tails,
and where do they occur ?
They are long, ribbon-shaped and
of the genus Trichiurus, silvery in
color and with the body drawn out
into a long, pointed tail. Several
closely-allied species occur in tem-
perate and tropical waters in both
hemispheres, one occasionally appears
in plenty off the coast of N.S.W.,
apparently coming from deep water,
and another swims in small schools
among the mangroves of northern
Queensland. The N.S.W. species is
commonly confused with the true
ribbon-fish and the frost-fish, but is
quite distinct from both.
* * *
Are there any limestone caves in
Tasmania ? Can glowworms be seen
in any of them ?
Caves in Silurian limestone are
frequent, both in northern and
southern Tasmania districts. Only
in the north have they been opened
up. These include the Chudleigh
caves, the Mole Creek series—Scott’s,
King Solomon’s, Bayard’s (Mara-
koopu) and Baldock’s caves, all
within easy distance of Mole Creek,
60 miles from Launceston —the Ulver-
stone caves at Gunn’s Plains, 16 miles
from Ulverstone, and the Winkleigh
caves near Beaconsfield. In some
caves (particularly those at Ida Bay
in the Huon district) there are
myriads of glowworms.

Were any Australian troops engaged
in France during World War 1 at the
time of the November, 1918, armis-
tice ?
After nearly a month in rest the
Australian Corps was, in early
November, on the march to the front
again when, after the Battle of Lan-
drecies, came the news that the enemy
was asking for an armistice. But
some Australian field artillery took
part with the British in the last fight-
ing; there were Australian tunnellers
in the advance-guard of the British
Fifth Army east of Lille, moving
towards Mons; and overhead the two
Australian squadrons of fighting
scouts were active to the last.

How many species of wombat are
there, and in what States are they to
be found?
Of the four distinct species the
common wombat (P. mitchelli) is
found in N. S. Wales, Victoria and
South Australia; the Tasmanian
wombat (P. tasmaniensis) is confined
to Tasmania; the Flinders Island
wombat ( P. ursinus ) occurs on Flin-
ders and Deal Islands in Bass Strait;
and the hairy-nosed wombat (P.
latifrous ) in South Australia. A fifth
species, the Queensland hairy-nosed
wombat (P. gillespiei), was described
by De Vis in 1900; though it is
apparently allied to latifrous, the
characters are somewhat contradic-
tory; according to Heber Longman it
should be regarded as a distinct
species, occurring near the southern
border of Queensland.

How to make an office-paste from
flour ?
Dissolve ioz. of alum in one pint
of warm water; when cold add flour
to make a creamy fluid; add boiling
water and stir till thick, then add pre-
servatives —four cloves, \ teaspoon
powdered resin and a few drops of
corrosive sublimate (bichloride of
mercury). For household work it is
better to make the paste as it is
required, in which case the preserva-
tives are not needed.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|d. per line; all others 2*d. per line.
Trans Diesels
I’m rather tired of reading about these
wonderful American diesel locomotives
for the Trans railway. The only apparent
fact is that the Commonwealth is buying
11 locomotives at the almost incredible
cost of more than £lOO,OOO each, most
of that figure representing borrowed
dollars. That means an increase of some
60 per cent, on the rolling-stock
investment during the line’s 33 years’ of
existence, and a 10 per cent, increase in
overall capital on which interest charges
have to be met.
What are we to get in return? Stream-
lined efficiency, 90 m.p.h. speeds,
schedules cut in half, trains fairly dash-
ing across the Nullarbor?
The Trans express running from Port
Pirie to Kalgoorlie forms a connecting
link between two other expresses, the
Melbourne-Adelaide “Overland” and the
Kalgoorlie-Perth “Westland,” and its
schedule is governed by their timing.
Nothing that can be done on the Trans
itself can alter that fact or reduce the
overall time below the 26-odd hours to
which we brought it before the war.
To which we brought it. Don’t forget
that. We Australians who can no longer
build anything, but must be content with
begging, borrowing or buying, did more
for the Trans then than anything
envisaged now or in the future. We cut
a full day off the trip. We eliminated
two changes of train and one break of
gauge. We designed, built and fueled our
own locomotives, and if they were a
rather poor effort —you’d have bought six
for the price of one diesel and their top
speed was no more than 80 m.p.h. at
least they did all that was asked of them
and maintained their schedule with ease.
I t reflects precious little credit on the
modern “industrialised” generation that
they’ve had to borrow nearly a million
quid’s-worth of dollars to restore this
service to the standard we reached with
our own resources 15 years ago.—Trans-
porticus (Singapore).
Rents
Inflation could be checked to some
extent by increasing rents to an equitable
basis. Many irresponsible persons are
buying gewgaws and redundant cars and
jewellery, while living on indigent pro-
perty-owners at preposterously meagre
and unfair rentals. Higher rents would
also give builders and owners the incentive
to build homes, flats and shops. Within
seven miles of Melbourne G.P.O. there
are 12,000 vacant allotments provided
with water, sewerage, electric power, gas
and transport facilities. These sites
would be quickly built on if our legislators
reverted to the 8 per cent, rental return
which obtained in pre-war days. —Pelm
(Vic.).
Hang the Cost
Mr. Menzies hit the nail on the head
when he told Victorian Premier Mc-
Donald he could not increase the Loan
Council allocation to Victoria because
State Government departments, compet-
ing against each other for materials, were
one of the main causes of the inflationary
spiral.
Competition between State Govern-
ment departments has become so strong
in Victoria that thousands of pounds are
being wasted just through the spirit of
competition. Over the last three or four
years several of the departments have
sought staff overseas, mainly from
Britain and European countries. But,
instead of the work being done by
immigration Department officials in
London and on the Continent, each de-
partment sent its own recruiting mission.
Last year missions from the State
Electricity Commission and the Railways
Department were abroad seeking staff in
the same countries. Now a mission from
the Tramways Board and another from
the Railways Department are roaming
Europe for staff. The Metropolitan
Board of Works has also voted to send
a mission to Europe immediately.
The quest for materials is much the
same. Some departments, like the Tram
ways Board, stick to the same old system
and advertise weekly for supplies.
Others, like the State Electricity Com-
mission and the State Rivers and Water
Supply Commission, buy direct and send
their buyers into the open market tc
compete against wealthy private enter-
prise for scarce materials. If they make
a purchase the cost is always high.
Shrewd, experienced engineers have
tried in vain to warn these departments.
The whole set-up is reminiscent of the
war years, and the old motto, “Get the
stuff, no matter what the cost,” still
seems to be the catchcry.— Waddlin
Willie (Vic.).
Birth Records
Australian States still paddle their indi-
vidual canoes with regard to legislation
on marriage and divorce, despite agitation
for uniformity in the Marriage Act.
Uniform action is also badly needed in
registration of births.
A glance through State registration-
forms finds curious diversity. Western
Australia, for instance, has two cards,
one for male registration, another for
females; the person registering must
make a solemn declaration as to correct-
ness and fork out a bob. Victoria re-
quires registration within 60 days (free),
but in the case of what is described as an
“illegitimate,” notification must be sent
along within three days if in a munici-
pality or seven days in other districts.
N. S. Wales also allows 60 days, but
in the Federal Territory, if 21 days have
“Must you CHEW this nailbrush when you do your teeth with it?"
elapsed after birth, a declaration must
be made before a magistrate.
Surely a common registration system
could be agreed on for all States. One
requisite should be that, when registering,
parents receive a certificate with a copy
of details registered. Another practice
due for a change concerns children
stigmatised as “illegitimate.”
There are occasions when it is neces-
sary to produce evidence of birth
ing school or college, enlisting, taking a
new job, entering for certain examina-
tions, life insurance, and so forth. The
question of legitimacy should not enter
into any of these. Except when it is
necessary to prove parentage and legiti-
mate birth for purpose of inheritance,
etc., it is the assurance of correct age
only that is necessary.
One solution would be the provision of
two forms of birth certificate —one con-
taining the essential facts of name and
date and place of birth ; the other, com-
plete with full details, to be available only
on the authority of a competent court of
law.—R.B. (Tas.).
Inflation
The wage-earner is staggered by the
soaring cost of living, but he’s all for a
higher basic wage; manufacturers and
builders are alarmed by runaway costs,
but work on a cost-plus basis which in-
creases profits as costs go higher ; com-
mercial interests are dismayed by sky-
rocketing prices, but keep chasing in-
creased selling-prices and more than a
comfortable margin of profit; politicians
are appalled by the vanishing value
of the pound but happy with
the growing volume of taxes on
growing profits and soaring wages. So,
except for pensioners and a few others
a minority which doesn’t pay wages, has
a negligible vote and little purchasing-
power—who gives a hoot about inflation ?
—G. A. Bailey (N.S.W.),
The Wool growers
I may be wrong, but it looks as though
this Wool Tax Deduction is going to be
continued. If so there will be consider-
able chaos, because there will very likely
have to be refunds, instead of collects,
from not a few woolgrowers. The Tax-
payers’ Association doesn’t approve ot
the tax, neither does economist Colin
Clarke
Professor Copland suggests that wool-
growers should put their stabilisation
money to be refunded and the J.O. funds
owed to them into a stabilisation fund.
Why the woolgrowers? According to
share indices published in dailies, pastoral
shares are the lowest and cattle prices
were never better.
Why pick on the sheepman? What s
wrong with having a go at the cattleman,
the breweries, hotels, retail and whole-
sale houses and the big industrial con-
cerns? This stabilisation scheme, on
which there was a huge No majority, was
doomed to failure from the start. Govern-
ment control was not the only thing
wrong with it. To my mind it seems im-
possible to stabilise a market which has
had a fluctuation from £7 to £3OO a bale
over a period of 20 years.
Assuming the wool market did fall
head over heels and this alleged stabilisa-
tion organisation had to keep on buying
and, of course, storing the wool, it would
mean an open go for the manufacture of
woollen substitutes and eventually the
wool would have to be sold at any old
price.
If, however, the wool were bought in
and processed, it would be a different
matter. The £45 million fund could be
the capital of a co-operative woollen
manufacturing company which could buy
its own wool, manufacture the goods and
sell direct to the public. Manufactured
woollen goods have always been dear,
compared with the price of the raw
material. Right in the middle of the de-
pression, when good Merino wool was
selling for 7d. per pound greasy, common
knitting wool was selling, retail, at 10id.
an ounce. A co-operative wool-processing
company would be able to sell manufac-
tured woollen goods much cheaper to the
public and would save a Government
subsidy on woollen goods.—J. C. (Q.).
The Cocky
Whv does the nation owe a debt to the
cocky'(B. 22/8/’51)? Wheat may be less
than market-value for bread and breakfast
foods, poultry and stockfeed, but it cer-
tainly is not less than cost of production.
When Mr. Menzies spoke in the Ade-
laide Town Hall during the last election
campaign a member of the audience de-
manded to know whether the Government
intended to do anything about an in-
creased price for home-consumption
goods. Mr. Menzies replied with his
customary courtesy that the question had
not been raised by any of the accredited
farmers’ organisations, but that the Gov-
ernment was always prepared to consider
any matter so brought forward. “You
would not say the present price is not a
payable one?” he inquired, and the man,
apparently a farmer, admitted that the
price is payable.
Some farmers may not have benefited
under the Debt Adjustment Act, but thou-
sands did, and it was the beginning of
hand-outs by the Government that marked
the beginning of the decay in farmers.
Why should the consumer raise his
voice when wheat was Is. Bd. a bushel?
We were paying a flour tax, which was
continued for years until the price rose
so high that even a farmer cquldn't
grumble at it.
The exchange rate was altered to help
the farmer —no, not for that reason alone,
but it did help him when prices were low.
Now, when prices are exorbitantly high,
there is no excuse for its continuance.
It is little short of a tragedy that land
men continue to moan as they do. The
incessant grumbling of dairyfarmers has
resulted in a 40-hour week for dairy-
workers in Victoria, and how that is go-
ing to help the industry I don’t know.—
Fodgie (S.A.).
The Color Problem
The first essential in any policy for
helping our aboriginal full-bloods is that
it should not be in the hands of metro-
politan ministers, women’s organisations
or uninformed idealists.
Most of these have a picture of our
black brother, his circumstances and
needs which is quite unreal. With the
best of intentions they would hasten his
ruin. Take this demand that the
aborigines should be given full citizen
rights as enjoyed by white Australians
who are not in jail. Such rights include
freedom to go into hotel bars and drink
alcoholic liquor. Anyone with first-hand
knowledge of our natives knows that
alcohol destroys them physically and
morally—it is nonsense to advocate giv-
ing them citizen rights without qualifica-
tion.
Our color problem has two aspects,
perhaps three —the full-bloods and the
mixed, and both living in settled areas.
As a basic policy, full-bloods not yet
completely demoralised by enjoying sur-
reptitiously the rights of the white should
be kept away from towns. The half-
castes should be given opportunities
gradually to take their places in white
communities. Camps and compounds
housing both.full and mixed bloods have
proved tragic failures.
Much has been made of the achieve-
ments of aboriginals like Albert Namat-
jira and Harold Blair; and there are
other remarkable exceptions to the
dictum that the Australian abo. is a
primitive, stoqe-age man. There are also
the boomerang and the sense of design
evident in the fashioning and decoration
of native weapons to suggest that the
aboriginal man has intelligence which in
some instances could be developed use-
fully. But a practical policy cannot be
based on the comparatively few excep-
tional facts that are known.
The abo. is a nomad, and it is very
doubtful whether he can be turned into a
farmer or made to stay put in
any regular occupation. He is a
good stockman —the variety and move-
ment of station work suit his tempera-
ment. , . .
In parts of the Murchison and m tne
north-west of W.A. the aboriginal native
is a valuable—almost invaluable—worker
on the big sheep-stations; but his is not
the cheap labor which metropolitan trade-
union organisers say it is. For every 1U
abo. stockmen or rouseabouts there are
at least 40 non-working dependants Kept
by the station. And, lately, pastorales
have had to pay fairly substantial wage.
With the extension of child-endowment
to the natives quite a lot of money come
into the wurley. This money is of httle
use to the natives, if, indeed, it is
harmful. Clothes and tobacco don t co.
much, and there is little to be done wit
the surplus. .
There have been exploitation and[dis-
creditable indifference to the welt a
the remnant of our abongma s
past; but in haste to make amends ther
is danger of proceeding to unpractical
extremes. Indiscriminate g
‘Tights” which have no real value
recipients and may prove rumou
attempts to turn the black in
by legislation and administration,
solve the problem. ,

New Editions of Two Best Selling Novels
SINUHE THE EGYPTIAN
by Mika Waltari.
Entirely authentic, it is written with a
literary excellence of which few historical
novels can boast. Events of war, murder,
passion, love and religious strife are re-
vealed as Sinuhe describes his often bril-
liant, often bitter, life.

MICHAEL THE FINN,
by Mika Waltari.
The author of “Sinuhe the Egyptian”
has now written the vivid story of
“Michael the Finn,” an illegitimate son of
the aristocracy who is brought up in Fin-
land by a peasant woman in the early
Sixteenth Century.

the mob.” As a monarchist, judged on
points, he would have found no more
favor if his pretensions had been
examined closely in the light of outbursts
which referred to the Royal family as
“royal cattle,” and which discussed their
“dementia” and opined that the only
man among the lot was Marie Antoi-
nette.
Judged for concrete success, there is
nothing to show except a part in a train
of drama which in all the circumstances
could have led to nothing save the
destruction by force of himself, whose
natural death in agony from nephritic
disease alone saved him from the knife.
From the beginning of his connection
with the revolution his lack of principle
was recognised, and in May, 1790, a full
year before his death shocked all Paris,
Freron’s Orateur du Peuple contained the
warning: “Mirabeau, Mirabeau, less
brilliance and more virtue, ou gare la
lanterne.” At the same time there never
was a greater demagogue or one who
established himself so quickly in the
affections of the mob with whose basic
ambitions and thought he was naturally
at loggerheads.
Mirabeau was in part-time a “Leftist,”
but he reached the Left as a deserter,
and there achieved pre-eminence one
would imagine rather by the fact that he
appeared to embody everything calcu-
lated to enrage and outrage the fastidious
feelings and good taste of the hated
aristocrats than through any direct com-
munity of interest with or sympathy for
the active body of his supporters,
described by Madelin as “that terrible
sediment that hides in the lowest depths
of society in our cities, artd even in our
villages.”
Hideous and thickset in figure—
“ Mirabeau the Barrel”—ponderous and
menacing in movement, furrowed of fore-
head and pock-marked of face, with
flaming, red-rimmed eyes and lips that
worked with passion, he was able to say:
“My ugliness is power.” In the face of
an infamous past, cynically dissolute
a venal nature, he had little in-
:-c out of the rostrum. He was a
t without shame both in his
a. ; - and in his oratory, but he had a
• -v / >f declamation which placed any
mb y to which he spoke as completely
s mercy as a rabbit in front of a
constrictor. He could argue with
what seemed to be the utmost logic and
he could sway with rhetoric or
beat down with scorn. He could set fire
to an assembly or turn a flicker of flame
into a raging holocaust of rage. He
was, in fact, on the platform “the torch
of Provence.”
Mr. Welch is unorthodox in his view
of Mirabeau’s achievement. He has
“written under the impulse of an opposite
belief” to the view of the great majority
of historians who “incline to see in him
a man of vast but perverted talents, who
mistook the popular movement, and who,
by seeking to divert it from its proper
-*nd, succeeded only in troubling its pas-
sage.” He believes that Mirabeau’s
attachment to the monarchy “had little
pf sentiment and nothing of mysticism
in it,” and that it arose from his con-
viction that the Crown was “the only
,r »«Mtution which could guarantee to
mce in fixture the unity it had given
ast.” This is a cloistered out-
ch a man. Little he cared
ice as such. The human
cnaiv ;• is that he would have backed
D.-‘. 1 mself with equal fervor if his
casoning had told him that the
* evil h the best chance of winning
ng his own objectives. He
came into the revolution not on the wings
of patriotism but on the raging tide of
circumstances—one of those engulfed in
it as a consequence of his own personal
history. It is true, as Mr. Welch says,
that “an undeniable splendor surrounds
his memory,” but few historians will give
him as much credit for honesty of pur-
pose as Mr. Welch does. Mirabeau’s
gifts were histrionic rather than the
patriotic emanations of a selfless nature.
Most opinion is likely to continue to side
not with Mr. Welch but with Madelin:
An actor formed by Lekain and Mile
Clairon, he would make speeches that had
been written for him, and yet seemed to
come from the very bottom of his heart.
He had admirable ideas on matters of
State; he was, indeed, the only great man
in the whole Assembly, though in the chaos
of that nebulous Parliamentary world he
was a useless and harmful force, which
was broken, indeed, at an early stage.
It might have been added that his
earlier private life, his escapades, his
love affairs and his father form together
a combination of material far more fas-
cinating for the most hardened reader of
romantic fiction than all his thunderings
on the tribune and mouthings of politi-
cal sentiments. He was as fascinating to
women as he was to Legislative
Assemblies. And they were just as
disastrous to him as his political
activities.
M.H.E.
Australian Literature.
As H. M. Green produced in Modern
Australian Poetry the only national
anthology we have with a firm and gener-
ally reliable critical standard, so he has
written in A ustralian Literature 1900-1950
(Melbourne University Press) the best
short survey of our literature this
reviewer has seen. It is a booklet of
some 5000 words which was commis-
sioned by the trustees of the Melbourne
Public Library as a Jubilee contribution.
There have been several similar
attempts recently to sum up our litera-
ture as a whole, some quite good up to
a point, but failing in the end either
through trying to include too many
writers or because of some literary or
political bias in the author. Mr. Green
keeps strictly arid steadfastly to writers
he considers of the first significance—and
most people will concur with most of
his judgments—and, seeking only for
literary value, whether or not it is speci-
fically “Australian” in expression, he is
without bias.
There are times, of course, when one
does not fully agree with him. A phrase
describing Steele Rudd’s humor as “crude
and insensitive” is the sort of generalisa-
tion that needs qualifying; there are
others of the same sort; and the
present reviewer, while yielding to no
man in admiration for the profoundly
rich and beautiful poetry of Judith
Wright, would hesitate to describe her as
“supreme among the lyrists of the second
half of the century” (M. Green means
the second half of the half-century he is
discussing) unless Kenneth Slessor is to
be classified in some different category
from the “lyrists” or pigeonholed in the
quarter-century before Judith Wright
came forward to take the lead in lyrical
poetry. However, it is clear enough that
Mr, Green admires both Slessor’s poetry
and Judith Wright’s ; and that is the only
point that really matters.
Two omissions should be noted, even
while praising the book for its compact-
ness : the failure to mention Edward
Dyson, whose short-stories are due for
a “revival” only a degree less enthusiastic
than the great Furphy furore of three or
four years ago; and the failure to
mention Nettie Palmer’s Henry Handel
Richardson —though this may have been
published too recently to have come into
the scope of the booklet. Nettie Palmer
is mentioned for her life of Henry
Higgins.
Finally, though one dislikes advancing
opinion upon unwritten work, one can-
not share Mr. Green’s apparently high
hopes for Robert S. Close as “perhaps
the most interesting” of the younger
novelists and “a promising member of
the tribe of Conrad.” Conrad would
doubtless never have approved of ban-
ning what was meant to be a work of
literature, but one would have thought
twice before asking the author of The
Nigger of the Narcissus to read Love
Me, Sailor.
But these are small points to bring
against a booklet so admirable in its
general balance. Mr. Green discusses,
among others, Paterson, Shaw Neilson,
McCrae, Mary Gilmore, Lawson, Vance
Palmer, Brian James, Henry Handel
Richardson, Furphy, Miles Franklin and
Brent of Bin Bin (making a distinction
between the two), Louis Stone, Katharine
Prichard, Eve Langley, Christina Stead,
A. G. Stephens and the past and present
Bulletin, Walter Murdoch; and, after
the poets, short-story writers, novelists
and critics, finds room for such descrip-
tive writers as Banfield and Jack
McLaren, and writers on history, politics
and science. His conclusion, to sum it
up in a sentence, is that we have a good
deal of major writing in Australian litera-
ture, distinguished by “freshness, sim-
plicity and energy,” but no one you could
really call a major writer;
In spite of the contribution of, let us say,
Brennan, Fitz Gerald, Slessor and Judith
Wright to world poetry, Paterson and others
to the ballad revival, and Lawson, Furphy
and Paterson to the revelation of the Aus-
tralian spirit, Australian literature stands
out not so much by reason of individual
achievements as of the mass of talented
work produced.
Mr. Green has, of course, special
qualifications for writing such a survey
as this. He makes an annual report on
the books of the year for “Southerly,”
he has published An Outline of Aus-
tralian Literature and is now working on
an expanded edition of that Outline.
Something should be done about his
booklet; it could be taken up in Aus-
tralian schools; and it could very well
represent Australian literature overseas
in any magazine, newspaper or encyclo-
paedia that might be interested.
