SATURDAY, AUGUST 19, 1882.
What do the People of New South Wales
live on?
We ask the above question for the third time
within three months. It involves a problem too
essential to be allowed to drop. The great
prosperity apparent on every side, the money
(to use a figure of speech not over-strained) now
running down the gutters, must eome either from
substantial profits, from increased value, or from
unwholesome inflation. In other words, we must
be living either on earnings, or on borrowings, or
on the squandering of our means. If on the first,
then our wealth is leal; if on the second, pay-day,
hjwover deferred, must come, and unless the
borrowed funds are being applied to really repro-
ductive uses, when it comes it will come with a
vengeance ; if on the last, then our next balance-
sheet will expose us, and we will stand before our
children in the character of fraudulent trustees.
Financial delusions have, long before our time,
created artificial prosperity which the people of
the day believed to.be sound. The tulip specula-
tion in Holland appeared to be so firmly established
that it began to be rated as one of the industries
of the country. A few years of profit, of busy
streets and well-filled taverns, are quite sufficient
to convince average observers that it is “all right,’*
and that things have gone on go from “ time im-
memorial,” but, nevertheless, in due time, through
the action of a law as sure as that of gravitation,
finance will recover its equilibrium through a re-
action reaching often the extremity of panic, fill-
ing the Bankruptcy Court with ruined schemes
and crowding the thoroughfares with a beggared
population.
• • •
If our wage-earners are supported mainly by
public expenditure, if the funds of providing the
moans for this public expenditure are got from
land —sales and loans; if the people who lend
this cash do so in the full belief that Now South
Wales is inhibited by a seP-supporting, wealth-
creating, and tax-paying-peoplo; if the success
of our lind sales depjnds on a string of ex-
ceptional circumstances, of which cheap money is
the principal,—then, the airy fabric of our for'
tunes may at any time be puffed away by a tremor
in the world of credit. Our foundation would be
much firmer if wa had a large rural population
like that of the United Stales, living in cheap
independence and household plenty; but pro-
bably, never in the history of New South Wales
were so few ot her people living this, the true life
of the colonist, as at the present time.
• • •
The first test that we used in starting this en-
quiry in May was taken from the census popula-
tion returns. These shewed that 5S per cent, of
our people live in the towns. The tendency to
urban life was still more strongly proven by the
distribution of the increase during the decennial
period. This increase of 247,487, about one-third
of the inhabitants of the colony, appeared as
follows :
In Sydney and Suburbs 89,451
~ Towns existing before 1871 51,221
~ Towns existing since 1871 61,792
Leaving for the increase of rural popula-
tion, including navvies and miners, only
18 per cent, or 41,010
217,487.
Regarding the employment of the people so con-
centrated in streets and villages, all that can be
said is, that we could hardly have manufactures
in operation sufficient to support these hundreds
of thousands of people without knowing it. Yet
they must live on something. What that some-
thing is the Goulburn Evening Post of the 18th
ultimo thus explains : —“ Government work is the
mainstay of the people, while private enterprise
is comparatively a mere nothing, and has hardly
an existence. What wa say of Goulburn, may be
said with equal truth of the whole colony. Land
sales and loans are the foundation of our wonder-
ful progress. When existing Government con-
tracts are completed, we Will have on our hands a
largo number of that very* undesirable class, the
unemployed. This is the position of things at
Goulburn, and the urgency with which most of
the other towns are importuning Government for
expenditure, points immediately to the inference.
that the description is widely applicable.”
• * •
The next test wo applied in The Bulletin of
the 15th July, was the commercia l position : the
returns of imports and exports. ' The incontest-
able conclusion was arrived at that merely to pay
oar way for the current year, each man engaged
to productive work ought to earn ,£212. This
did not comprise anything for interest on borrowed
money, or as a surplus to account for the
immense accessions of value in town and suburban
property, which, unless mere sham, wind, and
paper, must be based on surplus money got from
the grass, the mines, or the ploughed field. On
the other hand, the accumulation of deposits in
the Savings Bank, and the continued prosperity
of our great monetary institutions, may be cited
in proof of our sound and wealthy condition. The
Savings Bank returns merely show that a propor-
tion of the people will always lay by ; and as to
banking results, it is hardly necessary to point
out that the continued sale of land on Govern-
ment account, the deposit of the proceeds in the
bank, and the issue of the same again in fresh
discounts, to be used a third and fourth time in
new_ land purchases, shows not additional wealth
coming in, but only credit strained to an extreme
tension.
• * *
As fresh matter for consideration bearing on the
subject, wa now submit some figures representing
the returns of our great pastoral industry during
the past two years. The natural pastures of the
i colony are a direct gift from Heaven. Unsown,
untilled, perennial in their growth, they owe
nothing to human skill or care. Though but
partially fenced, insufficiently watered, and their
use hampered by unwise laws, they still
provide four-fifths of the wealth of Australia.
Half of our people’s food comes from them ; two-
thirds of our export} are produced by them, and
the whole of bur local and inland transport stock
is reared on them. We had, in 1880, 38,87*
holders, 395.931 horses, 2,580,010 cattle, 32,399,617
sheep, and we exported 151,871,832 pounds of wool.
In 1881 —36,097 holders, 340,675 horses, 2,161 495
cattla, 32,787,377 sheep, and 139,602,506 pound's of
wool were exported. So, during the past year, wo
have 9 per cent fewer stockowners than we had
the year before. We have 10 per cent, less wool,
we have 400,000 fewer cattle, and 45,000 fewer
horses. It appears singular that the number of
sheep returned shows no diminution, seeing the
palpable loss of wool, and knowing the tremendous
mortality which followed the drought of 1881 in
districts affected. In 1875. the sheep in New
South Wales numbered 24,382,000. By the year
1877, the number was reduced to 20,962,000. In
the ensuing years, a larger stock than ever was
put on, and the conclusion is inevitable that the
heavy stocking of runs, notorious of late, must
have entailed death or deterioration in large
numbers.
* * »
These figures do not lead to the belief in any
large pastoral surplus to account for present
prosperity. Our whole mining production, again,
is under the value of two millions in the year, and
it shows no sustained progress. Our agriculture,
(whatever its value may be locally, or as a topic
of electioneering, has yet attained slight national
importance. Of the produce of the soil con-
sumed in New South Wales, the value of
throe-fourths of a million sterling is imported
in excess of our exports of the same class.
We pay to growers outside the colony about
20a. per head of our people every year for
bread and vegetables. Are there any other
producing industries that employ many hun-
dreds of our people? If not, then the question
of ‘‘How do our people live?” has received no
satisfactory answer. But live they do, and live
well, and but few of them seem to put by money.
An accurate observer of the doings among opera-
tives employed on largo contracts, remarked that,
after food and rent were paid, every farthing went
in grog and haberdashery. This may go on for a
year—or, indeed, for as many years as the public
creditor asks no questions, and the patient people
supply the funds ; for supply them they do,
the score may be eventually paid in the
increased burdens fastened on their children, or in
the waste of the public territory. But all such
considerations are now, and will continue to be,
less than nothing to the politicians of Now South
Wales as long as money can be borrowed and land
can be sold. Even till “ the hand is seen writing
on the wall,” they will continue to shout at ban-
quets in honour of a system of Government buoyed
•up by a financial balloon and floating in an atmos-
phere of peculation and jobbery.
A Tainted Saint.
‘ In every Age,” says Gibbon, ‘‘ the absence of
genuine inspiration ia supplied by the strong
illusions di enthusiasm and the mimic arts of
imposture.” The insight of the accomplished
historian, and the aptness of his language, could
receive no better voucher than has been furnished
by the revolting disclosures in the District Court
in a recent trial for slander. In this case, an
individual who has raado himself prominent as an
apostl'j and expounder of the modern superstitions
religion known as spiritualism, prosecuted a
quondam associate and disciple, for charging him,
by printed handbills and otherwise, with infamous
immoralities. A verdict equivalent to acquittal
was returned by the jury, but the defendant
remains under detention during pleasure, on the
grounds that the evidence disclosed insanity on
his part. 'Jhe actual drift and purport of the
evidence was suppressed by all the dailies, and,
indeed, could not be published unless under the
decent cover of a dead language, only intelligible
to the learned, gome such record should bo pre-
served, since no more extraordinary disclosure of
delusion and frantio emotional disturbance is
known to science. There seems no reason to
doubt the sincerity of the leading actor in
this extraordinary affair. He appears to have
been actuated throughout by the strong
illusions of enthusiasm.” His excited imagina-
tion, triumphing over his weak intellect, seduced
him into receiving, as spiritual commands ant
moral injunctions, directions to debase himself
the most revolting practices. St. Simeon Stt
LITES was probably not more sincere than thi
modern victim of a monstrous hallucination ; am
St Simeon, primitive Christian though he was
was an extremely filthy creature, The hero o:’
the Sydney affair was unclean, to a degree whio.i
renders the surroundings of the pillared sain ;
pure by comparison; while the ardour of one
spiritualist, and the sacrifice ho was prepared t
endure in order to purge himself from fleshl;r
lusts, far exceeded the severest asceticism of thi
early confessors and martyrs. One has to go
back to the dimmest myths of extreme antiquity
to find a parallel for the self-immolation contem
plated by this wretch with the mind of a satyr, the
resolution of a hero, and the self-sacrificing deter-
mination of a saint. The story of Atys, alle
gorically treated by the Emperor Julian, and
thrown into poetic form by Catullus, will convey
a sufficient indication of our meaning to those who
have a right to comprehend.
* • •
Spiritualism has Jrpceived a curious illustration
by the disclosures at this trial. That the adepts
in this modern mysticism are able to produce
phenomena which contradict natural laws, so far
as these are ascertained (an important qualifica-
which paralyse ordinary‘explanation, is
perleotly well-known to candid investigators.
Phenomena have been produced under circum-
stances which rendered the hypothesis of imposture
impossible—phenomena which no known Jaw ac-
counted for. Physical demonstrations were odd
and inexplicable enough, but the spiritual mani-
festations far transcended the former in interest
and [reconditeness. The genuineness of some
“ mediums ” has been as far removed from doubt
as the imposture of others, especially public pro-
fessors, has been certain. A very slight degree of
study, and of reading, suffices, however, to estab-
lish the fact that convulsionary and epileptic con-
ditions do unmistakeably produce a sort of exalt-
ation, _ not readily, if at all, distinguishable
from inspiration and supernatural extension of
affinities into the spiritual world. The religions
revival, under the auspices of Wesley and Whit-
field, produced nearly, if not quite, all the phe-
nomena now remarked in spiritualistic mediums.
There were powerful operations of the spirit,
attended in multitudes of cases with trance, and
even prolonged physical agonies with insensibility
to what was passing around the sufferers.
Numbers of persons fell, during the revival services,
as if struck by lightning, and recovered only to
feel that a groat change had been wrought
in their minds. Some blasphemed and fought
with evil spirits for hours, till, as in the
days of Christ, the evil spirits “ rent them sore”
and quitted them. Some remained purified and
sobered for life. Some experienced but transient
grace. Some became hopelessly insane. Again,
the Irvingites, in more recent times, experienced
similar manifestations. They imagined themselves
invested with the gift of tongues ; and whole con-
gregations of serious, reverent, and sincere Chris-
tians, listened with respect and awe to the loud
gibberings of strong men, or to the shrill shriek-
ings of refined women, gabbling gibberish which
was solemnly aceepted as an unknown tongue.
• • •
Amidst these various ravings, there has never
failed to be a considerable proportion of out-
pourings of sterling morality and lofty philosophy,
and so has it been among Spiritualists. 'J hought-
ful men have long entertained the conviction that
while the modes of communication, when imposture
is not at work, defy present knowledge, the matter
of such communications can, in every instance,
be traced to the mind of some one person
present, or to the aggregate knowledge of
all present ; and, if not to what is obviously
known to the persona present, to information
or recollections unconsciously stored in their
minds, ordinarily latent and irrecoverable, but
capable of being quickened into available use by
peculiar excitation, under conditions sometimes
attainable, but not readily defined nor accurately
ascertained. This theory suffices to explain a
host of apparent contradictions and discrepancies.
It is generally known that Spiritualism is a self-
contradictory faith, and contains, in its own litera-
ture and history, records and statements which
mutually destroy one another. Thus, there are
Christian Spiritualists, whose phenomena are but
continuations of the apostolic miracles, whose
mediums utter nono but orthodox deliverances,
and whoso supreme guide and key to interpret all
figurative language or doubtful appearances is
the Bible. But, on the other hand, there
are Freethinking Spiritualists, whose mediums’
moat striking deliverances are what the orthodox
would regard as frightful blasphemies. And there
are other circles of every grade of thought and
belief, all receiving endorsement and encmxrage-
ment from what they conceive to bo their tffiniliar
spirits. In some circles the mediums breathe the

But WO had scarcely been prepared to realize the
correctness of the hypothesis that the spirits which
speak are not the disembodied spirits ot the dead,
but the disembodied spirits of the living—-that is
to say, of those present at a seance, and sufficiently
susceptible of the nameless influence which is
thrust upon us by the recent court expose, there
are, it seems, circles where the eructations of
coarse and brutal imaginations and sensualisms,
belch from the mediums, and signify their purport
through inanimate substances. Bettor evidence
of the human origin of these teachings and
phenomena could not have been afforded, than the
complex and inscrutable admixture of vileneas and
grandeur with, which only the inexpliuable, al
though ascertained, inconsistency of the human
disposition is compatible, which at the same time
urged a wretched votary to sickening atrocities,
and prompted him to submit, for his soul s sake,
to a sacrifice which when accomplished would
certainly, to quote again the words of Gibbon,
have brought in its train, “ a transition from the
wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint,
calculated to fill a man with pity, a eunuch with
despair.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Oath or Affirmation?
Tins French Chamber of Deputies has decided to
Modify the form of oath which has prevailed in the
law-Courts of the nation. The form has hitherto been
“ I swear before God and Man,” not nearly so impres-
sive ns our own form, ending “So help me, God,”
which is in fact an imprecation. The style decided
upon by the French Chamber of Deputies, and probably
by this time endorsed by the Senate, is “ On my honor
and word I swear,” a form which tacitly excludes an
invocation of Divine attention, and reflects the scepti-
cism of the intelligent classes in France. The Paris
correspondent of the Herald, commenting upon this
change, remarks that the new form of affirmation will
certainly weaken the value of evidence generally
Unless the Frenchman is infioitely more sensible of
religious obligations than the average Australian, it is
difficult to see how this can be. It is a matter of
common observation that our own solemn form of
oath has lost its influence. A very large proportion of
witnesses in our Courts swear to whatever suits them.
The Herald’s correspondent thinks that swearing on
one’s honour and conscience will be an absurdity. A
curious contradiction of this happened in our own
Supreme Court the other dav, when a witness, per-
ceiving that the cross-examining counsel was openly
discrediting his sworn testimony, suddenly, and at a
critical point, supplemented his oath by a declaration
“on his honour"—thus shewing that he regarded the
latter affirmation as likely to be recognised as binding
on him, even when the influence of his oath had been
doubted. The truth lies, probably, outside both
theories. Now-a-days, formal observances on the one
band, and cool sceptisismjon the other, have so sapped
the foundations of supernatural religion and the obli'
gatious imposed by it, that the man who will lie, as a
matter of business convenience, will generally swear to
that lie, if the occasion seem to justify the risk, not to
his immortal soul, but to bis temporal prosperity and
social standing. To an orthodox liar an oath is little
bond, save in ihe case of very debased intelligences
which have not shaken off superstitious terrors. Again,
a lying sceptic will negotiate on affirmation with as
much ease as bis orthodox rival will swallow an oath.
The form employed scarcely matters. If our French
brothers resemble our own generation of litigants they
will gain nothing by the change just effected. What
we have said before, we repeat again, that the only way
im which oar law courts can be preserved from becom-
ing machines by which unscrupulous rogues may
oppress conscientious men, and wrong trample upon
night, is by giving active effect to the laws against
perjury, and pursuing the villain suspected of giving
fab e testimony with the same determined scrutiny as
dogs the steps and investigates the antecedents of the
suspected murderer. To kill a man ie a terrible crime;
hut to assassinate Justice by the slow poison of perjury,
dealt out drop by drop, is an infamy and a wrong in-
finitely more atrocious and more grievous to society.
Timeo Danaos.
An intimation has been published by the authorities of
the Sydney University that the next matriculation
examination will taie place in March of next year. And
along with this announcement there is one which shows
tihat the policy stated by the Chancellor in the com-
memoration address is now an accomplished fact. The
subjects for the examination to which reference is made
are English, Latin, Arithmetic, Algebra and Geometry,
and all of the following subjects, namely Greek,
French, German, Chemistry and Natural Philosophy.
The Latin ex anination, by the way, will ho a stiff one;
the text is Horace's odes, hooka, and the Satires, book
2. There are in tha 3rd book 30 odes, totalling 1014
lines, and in the second hook of the Satires, 8 satires
totalling 1055 lines, in all 2097 lines of an author
who is not to he read by dullards. It
will be strange indeed if Dr. Badham doesn’t
make a stiff paper out of these, along with ex-
ercises. Heretofore, _ the natural philosophy and
chemistry have been alternative, hut still necessary,
subjects ; yon needn’t take both, but you must take
*ibher. But the Senate have proved the truth of
Yiroil’s saying-—“ Easy is the descent to Avernus;”
they have put Greek on a par with (“ Oh, soul of
Sir John Cheeke!”) gas-bottling. Now, again,
Germ in or French ranks with Greek, physics, and
ehmiistry, as an alternative subject. It might have
been well if German and French had been braoketted
together. All the science and modern languages
would not balance the Greek, the loss of which in a
University man will be loss indeed. The utilitarians
may say what they like—Greek and Latin should not
be separated, and their place cannot be filled in a
scheme of liberal education. The change has been
made, however, A man shall he able from next year to
go through Sydney University with credit to'himself ;
yat to him the sublime language of Plato, of Hosier,
«£ Aristophanes, of Euripides, of Sophocles, of
Xenophon, of the New Testament, may be a thing
unknown and unregarded. His, and the country’s, wil 1
ha the loss.
Me. Hd»h Taylor, ex-M.P., cannot be credited with
tho distinction of having originated the idea of coffin
selections. AU the honour that is due to him seems to
be the feat of helping to dig suitable corpses wholesale
out of the Government catacombs generally styled
asylums. The plan of utilizing moribund persona as
dummies is popular in many quarters. But it has been
customary to appropriate relatives for the elevated
function. Not long ago. for example, out West, a brisk
business man imported from other parts a consignment
of assorted connections, including his aged mother, ait.
about 70. This remarkable lady, albeit decrepid and in
failing health, had no sooner arrived than expiring
nature flickered into a bright flame, and she burned to
become a selector. Her loving son was not the man to
disregard the most sacred promptings of filial duty. He
provided the old lady with funds, drove her down to the
Lands Office, and, with the assistance of equally filial
relatives, carried the app'icant into the land agent’s
department, where she secured 640 acres. This accom-
plished, the old lady was able to die happy very shortly,
and it was but natural that so dutiful a son should be
her heir. Formerly it used to be the practice to drive
merely a coach and four through the laws. In Aus-
tralia, we have improved on that: we drive our hearses
through the statutes.
We observe that the conductors of the Dailt Tele-
graph have found it necessary to take notice of our
leader of last week, in a very characteristic fashion.
They can’t rise above their weaknesses. They deal
with us as they did with Mr. William Forster ; that
is to say, they call us names This is very unpleasant,
and hurts our feelings; but it would be still more un-
pleasant and would hurt our feelings still more deeply,
if the staff of our contemporary were to carry their
system of literary disputation a trifle further, and come
down in a body to stand in the street opposite our
office, bawl epithets and put out their tongues at us.
When they do make up their minds to display the
direction their literary talents take, the Telegraph
people might as well do the thixg thoroughly.
The country is now getting too suspicious as to the
legal acquirements of the present law adviser of the
Government. It now occurs to them for the first time
that they they never saw anything of it in their lives.
That “ Uralla ” business was as fatal to the A.Q. as was
the “ ring” business to the C.M.Q. Alas! the idols of
the people are breaking themselves to pieces. Some
morning they will rise and find Parkes, like Dagon,
fallen on his face. What a howl there will then be in
the high places of the secret societies! There is only
Parkes now left of this Ministry. The rest are all
condemned already. The “ six old men'’ and the “ two
hundred and seventy-nine” land-sharks, with their
twelve million acres of the people's laud, have done
for the Minister for Lands; the Colonial Treasurer,
like the Minister for Mines, and the Minister for
Education, never was anything; the Minister for
Justice has wrought his own perdition in pitchforkiug
the Government whip and teetotal stickler on the
Licensing Bench against the ins'incts of every fair-
minded man in the colony ; and the Uralla small-talk
has disposed (f Wisdom. Nothing but the rag-tag-
and-bobtnil; the lame, the halt, a.nd the blind; the
scrapings and refuse of certain religious and secret
societies in the present Parliament would keep this
Government in office one hour after the House meets.
Never before in the history of this colony were our
political institutions more incapable and corrupt.
This House was elected on a sectarian cry ; it has ful-
filled its mission, and is now dead. Pure politics is
foreign to its individuality. It has not enough life in
it to keep it from putrefaction.

Mr. Robert L. Tooth, M.P.
Our portrait in the front page this week is that
of Mr. K. L. Tooth, one of the members for the
Monaro. Mr. Tooth was born in Sydney in 1844.
Ha received his education in England, and, on bis
return to this colony, entered on the management
of the extensive business of the Kent
This enterprise was founded by Mr. Tooth s
father, and has been very successful. Mr. Tooth
was nominated for East Sydney, against Dr. Ren-
wick, the present Minister of Mines, on his accept-
inw office, but was defeated. At the last general
election, Mr. Tooth was nominated to a seat for the
rich and prosperous electorate of the Monaro, and
was returned with a very large majority. Iho
coming session of Parliament will doubtless afford
Mr. Tooth an opportunity of unfolding his pro-
gramme. [Our portrait is from a photo by .Free-

George Johnson, charged with perjury in the

Barton, declared his innocence.

months at liberty when ha commits a crime which
sinks his former misdeeds into insignificance.
The “ reverend” Father Leeming, who, when in
Sydney, swindled his slater out of her foitune, and
did a variety of other things, and who lately took to the
s'age in America, has now, we learn, been " converted
to Protestantism. Ho is stumping the country a la
Chiniquy. His reverence is one of that numerous class
of saints who never gain much honour in their own
country.
Miss Clara Morris is, as regards genius and
eccentricity, the Bernhardt of America. Audiences
have learned net to be surprised at anything she may
do. lu the midst of an impassioned outburst, phe will
walk aoro*B and regulate a lamp or gas-jet. She will
pause in a dramatic crescendo to pick up a pin, or to
place an ornament square on the table. Once, when an
actor was lashing himself into a stage fury to kill her,
she insisted on picking little hits of fluff off his coat;
at another time, in the middle of a passionate wooing,
she coolly readjusted her lace necktie. “It put me,
remarked the lover, "right off my stroke.
The shorthand squabblers of Sydney, may be
interested to learn that a Mr. Thomas Anderson, who
according to a London journal, “writes with
in his recently published “ History of Shorthand
“hails with satisfaction the present activity in;the
issue of new systems, regarding it as a sign that im-
provement may bo expected. Yet, so far as his own
experience goes, he seems to cling to a system now
nearly a century old; for, in condemning that of Pit-
man, he remarks that Taylor’s is still the heat for all
practical purposes, although theoretically and in some
cases excelled by that of Qnru*y. The book is full of
carefully drawn examplesof the different styles.
The London Daily Telegraph has come ou
in the entirely new light of a social entertainment.
From 10 o’clock. Fleet-street was blocked by an ex-
pectant crowd before the awning which had been erected
in front of the offices, and through which there ap-
peared a refreshing vista of ferns and flowers and
waterfalls. The building itself is very flue with marble
pillars, marble floors and carved oak wainscot, and it
was filled on the occasion by a numerous and dis-
tinguished company who marvelled much at the
deafening noise of the great machines that turn out
120,000 copies of the paper in an hour. There was the
Artillery Band, and some excellent refreshments, and
everything was splendidly done. The Prince of Wales
was present.
By the death of Rev. J. G. Stobbs, the Presby-
terian Church loses one of a group of four or five—the
late Peter Menzies, William Henderson, of Ballarat,
Strong, of Scots, and Brunton—who have tried
hard to drive into the heads of the Kirk some of the
results of modern knowledge, whilst keeping some-
where within the bounds of the Westminster logar-
ithms. They have just managed to persuade their
congregations that two and two are something le c s than
ninety-five; but, up to date, have had little effect on
the aged brethren of the assembly—the Cairnses, and
Duncan Frazers, and Murdoch M’Naebodies of the
last century. These old fossils stand in the way of
everything that smacks of sunshine, but we suppose
we may ring in the secular K.I.P. of R. W. Emerson
and say, “To-day the sun shines also.” Mr. Stobbs,
who was married but a few years since, was about 44
when he died, and was much esteemed by the Mel-
bourne public. He was a hard-headed, big-hearted
gentleman, utterly unconventional in his manner—so
unconventional that he was rot afraid to go to the
Melbourne Club and smoko his pipe among the mem-
bers.
The Owl Club roosted at the Cambridge Club
on Wednesday week, all the perches being occupied.
The hoot commenced at 8 30 and continued till nearly
midnight. Yellow Hammerand Mother Carey’s Chicken
warbled a duet sweetly, and Bedkreast articulated
"Good-bye, Sweetheart,” but he seemed to have a cold,
caused by too much night air. A visiting Crow of
rather lame pretensions essayed to recount the adven-
tures of an oyster expedition, which may have been
funny, but ho made a bad stew of It, and would have
been more at home behind the bivalve stall round the
corner. Wbogdoodlo was successful, and, assisted by
a crow from the green isle, kept up continued mirth.
Bullfinch warbled nicely a now refrain, the “ Dali of
Dreame” (written by Victor J. Daley, the music by J.
Delaney), which took the fancy of the audience ;
and the Lyre Bird pa riotically gave “ Here
Stands a Post,’’ with a grand finale of three flutters lor
the Egyptians. “ King Henry or Navarre” by a comio
soap man was well delivered, and so were several tune-
lul melodies by a crow, Mr. Hallewell, which caused
unusual flutter. Other birds shared in the hoot, which
was considered a success. A correspondent writes this.

I AM
THEGREAT
ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
TN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr, Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
•* I have found St, JACOB’S GIL a sure and certain
care, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains inths back, brought on by over-ex*
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.*'
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he Pays
that St. JACOB'S OIL aQJ good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

been made a C M G. t and, for reasons, it was con-
cluded at first that Mr. C. J. Roberts was tbe sufferer,
Honbts have, however, since arisen, and steps are

designed for Mr C. J. Roberts, Colonel Roberts (sow

the world of the utter falsehood of the accusation it ii

rare, too, as well as Messrs. J. D. Young and Jeremiah
O Connell. And pray who are these two men f Why,
brethren, they are two big Papists; and do you think
rot one moment that I would throw over a brother
Orangeman for 1000 Papists ?"
The late Rev. Dr. M'Qibbon was a fierce
opponent of the theatre. As an nltra-Calvinist, this is
not to be wondered at. Bat hi* antipathy was marked
by more than ihe usual malignance which clerics
manifest in regard to the drama. Nothing good oould
come out ef Nazareth. Now it came to pass that,
while on his way back to the colonies in the St. Oagth,
he had, as fellow passengers, the opera company of
which Ouadagnini and Paladin! were members. On
the first Sunday at sea the reverend doctor, of course,
held a service ia the cabin, whish was poerly attended,
most sf the male passengers prsferrlng to lounge about
the deck novel-reading, while the ladies went in for
faiicy work and flirtatio*. Some of the passing era who
••Jsotsd to the services prevailed on the lady who
played on the harmonium to demrt the doctor. Se
was a floe rage, and completely at a lose to know
what to do for mnsio, when Ouadagnini, the prima
donna, stepped forward, and. in delightfn! broken
■nglish, said, •• Me play for you, and sing.” And she
did, too, and nearly all the opera company look part in
the singing. Now, not only were these peopls wicked
actors and aotresses, but, herrors upon horrora’ head I
they were Bomsn Catholics. Therefore, they were
doubly damned in the opinion of the late lamented
doctor.
That giddy young nobleman, the twentieth Earl
ef Shrewsbury and fifth Lord Talbot (in tbs latter case
Premier la.rlnf England), who recently eloped with
Mrs. Miller Mundy (the Earl wee thrashed and the
lady divorced in eonsequones), hss at last married Mrs.
M , who appears to be his master as well as bis miHrets.
The wedding eventualed at a registry effloe in Mount,
atrest. The bride was beautifully attired, though not
in bridal white. The Earl’s solicitor and an elderly
female attended as witnesses. In “ Conlngsby,” Lord
•Beaooegfleid defines plnok as (according to Lord Mon-
month s idea) "a total disregard of public optnien."
If this is what it is. Lord Shrewsbury and his bride
must have a full share, for few people in their position
would have gone flaunting down to the family place,
having previously ordered •• demonstrations" to be
got up. Ir. appears that they were met by tenants who
escorted them from the station to the house; that there
were eight triumphal arches in four miles, and that
young ladies presented the bride with bouquets I
Thackeray's picture of the abject servility of the
British public is as absolutely true now as it was forty
years ago Suppose he is a nobleman of a jovial
turn, the public will sympathise good-naturedly with
ms amusements, and say he is a hearty, honest fellow.
Suppose he is fond of play and the turf, and has a fancy
to bo a blackleg, the public will fawn on him, and many
honest people will court him, as they would court a
housebreaker if he happened to be a Lord. Suppose he
is an idiot, yet, by the glorious constitution, he is good
enough to govern us; he may be an ass, and yet re-
spected ; or a ruflUn, and yet exceedingly popular ; or a
rogue, and yet excuses will be found for him. Snobs
will sti l worship him." Anyhow, the erewhlle belle of
JUerbyghire society—first Miss Palmor.Morewood, then
Mrs. Muudy— o?.n snap her Angers in the faces of her
thousand and one detractors. She has done what from

A RASPER.
HUNTING HIM TO HELL WITH A HATCHET.
Thii is a brimstone heading for a quiet paragraph
such as we are jast mow sitting down ou our little bed
to write. Bat it is a reiy clean-cut title for the conduct
or the iihabitanta of a certain South Australian town
with regard to a dead Chinaman the other day. It
appears John had.threngh some oversight or other, been
buried in consecrated ground. When the fact became
■
in that peaceful little bush town, except the deacon
and the thrum snareller, that did not stand up on its
end in holy honor. And the deacon and the thrum-
enaveller were bald. It is said—but wo believe this part of
the story is apocryphal—that a secret meeting of the
most orthodox members of the local churches was held
on the night whereon the discovery was made, and that
they solemnly shook in the hat to appoint two of their
Bimber to go and dig up the Chinaman’s remains. One
took a spade, tbo ether a hatchet. It was dreadful
work ', ■e«n»» »H the Christian dead who had con-
secrated claims of their own had clubbed together to
Ireeae the Chinaman out. In vain. They had jammed
Bheir bone-boxos against his but could not shift it an
mob wpwards. '1 he specific gravity of his own dirt,
taken together with tha» which it had gathered to
i “ ““ rIn K half a centnry’s pilgrimage through this
vale of tears, were toe much for them. They only sno-
•eeded in driving him down through the crust of the
earth. The man with the spade, when he
got to the bottom of the grave, found a
hole through which the coffin of the Chinaman
had suck. The man with the hatchet went down this
hole, hewing his way where the earth had closed In.
After along time he came to the surface onoe more.
But he was never seen to smile again. He infermed his
companion in a ghastly whisper that he had been on
the roof of Hell. He was on the track of the heathen's
bone-box all tbs time. There was a hole in the roof
through which it had fallen. After his eyes had become
accustomed to the infernal glare of the flames below
him, he looked down. There-he said-be saw a eight
that Bade his blood run cold even tu such a plaoe. A
long table of red-hot basalt runs right through the
•outre of Hell. On it were several unknown imple-
ments. These were attached to it by chains. This was
to prevent the souls of Sydney land speculators from
stealing them. All along one side of this table there
was an endless row of souls unpacking their bodies oat
of the various gin-cases in which they were planted.
Some of their faces ho knew by reason of having seen
photographs of them in the Town and Cocntut
JonaNAt. And he noticed that these who bad “died
in the odour of sanctity" and “regretted by all who
knew them, had the fattest bodies, but the most
awrm signs of secret agony in their souls. Bnt they
Had splendid plates on their coffins, and maguifl-
cent testimonials on the tombstones above. That
was a comfort, anyhow. At the eitreme end ef this
table the man with the hatchet saw the soul of the
damned Chinaman filing the bones of its body down
into dice. Subsequently he paw the heathen playing
Yankee pah with the devil with these very bonos. And
the heathen won. After losing half-a-doren games the
devil got up in a rage and slapped a new arrival on the
ghostly back, grinning over his shoulder at the same
time with a grin of desolate glee. The lately damned
was from Sydney. The devil shook hands with him,
and the man with the hatchet noticed that a peculiar
k, *t hard and fast—was exchanged between
them. Then for the first time he discovered that the
devil was a C.M.G. All the rest is blank. Prom that
elme forth this man has n- var attended a prayer-meet-
ing, and has passed the happy hours away in a per-
petnal drunk.” Wa had something to say about the
prevalent orthodox custom of cutting the earth up into
consecrated chunks, but we will have to defer this.
It seems that you may sin “at homo,”
And to it all are blinded ;
That ladies fair can giddy be.
And no one seems to mind it.
By sinning, Mrs. M. has got
Not chastened, sirs, but petted;
For giving Mr. M. the slip.
Behold she’s eeronetted!
When asked to marry her, ’tis said,
The Earl took it in dudgeon;
Bat after was persuaded by
A great big brother’s bludgeon.
They’re happy now j but soon, we trow,
His lordship will get surly,
And then, perhaps, she’ll wish herself
Out of the Barly.burly.
The tenants welcomed home the pair.
With joyous, beaming faces ;
(Morality is rather loose
In those small rnstio places).
They roasted oxen whole, and drank
Big barrels-full of cider;
Her ladyship addressed them, while
His lordship sat beside her.
** I dunno what ish all abontsh,”
The Earl then feebly bellows;
“But wbatsh she shays is ri‘, you betch—
Here pass sher wine, you fellows.”
Now, things thus nicely are arranged,
Society won't be surly;
’Twill soon be “ Marlborough House—The Earl
And Countess—Small and Early."

In times of bloom gone by.
For dimmer grows the pleasant seem
Beneath the pleasant sky j
The world is growing old, sixteen—
The weary world and I.
Ah, wonld that once again, sixteen,
A kuaine mouth had I:
The days would gaily go, I ween.
Though death should stand anigb,
I'E spring-time’s gresn were evergreen,
if Love wonld never die
And I were young as you, sixteen,
Anl you were old as I.
Little Tommy.
A BALLAD.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They were just a party of throe
Or, rather, a party of tour.
If you let. as humanity
Little Tommy the black boy score.
There were red headed Bill, Ben Bix,
And Archy M'Nab—bushed, away
Oa Waroop, in a frightful fix—
The last bit of strap chawed that day.
LitHe Tommy had vowed to go
Where he said was “ plenty tuck out,"
For frioasoed boots form, we know,
■Not a diet to brag about.
And, strange, while the whita fellows round
Q tc thin as a sweep in a flue,
Li'tie Tommy grew f».t, having found,
And kept to himself, some uardoo.
They noticed the fact and they sighed
And wept when they though of his greed.
And said though no good as a guide
Little Tommy would make a grand feed.
Then Archy alone interviewed
Littio Tommy j in spite of a cough
TJ ted arguments telling if crude—
During which a revolver went off.
Most wonderful I that very night
When they sat once more by the blase,
A savoury stew was the sight
Which gladdened their famishing gate.
They ate fat and lean, picked the bones,
Flats put a second course on :
Ne’er missed him, nor asked in ssd tones
Where plump little Tommy had gone.
Don’t take a censorious view
Of what is reported re shot,
Just because the rest of that stew
Made breakfast next day piping hot.
Refreshed ear friends pushed on their tramp.
And, seeing tome smoke from a brown
Hilltop, reached the hlaokfellows’ camp
AVhile Tommy's fond mater “ sat down.”
“ Little Tommy Tong you F” Where three
Worn waistcoats bulged out quick she pried
“ Mo smell um my Tommy” said she—
“ All gammon 1” they promptly replied.
“ Where Tm gone ?” The query rose shrill;
Keen scent gave her motherly pain ;
Came answer from red-headed Bill
** Little Tommy 'long nm Bed Lane."
" Where Red Lane—that fellow ?” With close
Mouths—silently—it appeared wise
To depart, lest seeming morose
Should any more questions arise.
Still his Me, a waddy in hand,
Awaits little Tommy, and grows
Impatient to quite understand
What led her astray in the nose.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Shakespeare’s “ sublime tragedy,” “Othello,”
drew large houses at the Gaiety last week. “ Othello"
may be a mighty old play from a psychological point
of view, but, from the common-fcase standpoint, it is
just sublime swashbucklerism and no more. When the
glamour of rich dresses and costly accessories is re-
moved, one awakens to the fact that Othello is simply
a mad buck-nigger. We don’t think Mr. Sheridin
acted wisely in choosing ibis part, nor that he acted
well after having chosen it. But Walter Reynolds is
the lago after our own heart. His power of facial ex-
pression is phenomenal—we counted at least seven
hundred different faces he made in fifteen minutes.
And each was uglier than the other. lago we imagined
to be a wily, soft-voiced Italian—not a teeth-gnashing,
grinning goblin. Miss Davenport made a lovely, but
not very fine Desdemona Mr. Frank Cates was a good
Cassio. The scenery was splendid.
* * * *
“ Ingomar,” which is modestly termed in the
programme “ Mrs. Lovell’s beautiful poetic play,” was
put en after “Othello." A full house justified the
msmagemant, and the work of the actors was well done.
W« don’t intend just now to enter into a minute
analysis of Mr. Sheridan’s performance as Ingamar.
Art is long and life is short, and there is a new kind of
beer-glass invented with a bottom two inches thick,
which makes us too hitter against human nature to say
a good word for anybody. This kind of deception
causes the iron to enter into our souls, when we could
hear of the hanging of Arabi Bey and tha burning of
Alexandria with a seraphic smile. Which reminds us
that on the way home from the Gaiety last night wo
met a noble Thespian who was trying to uproot a lamp-
post under the impression that he was carrying away
the Pyramid of Cheops. We content ourselves with
saying straight away —or as straight as we can after a
midnight debauch with a candidate for the vacant
Bishoprie—that Mr. Sheridan played Mrs. Lovell’s
Ingomar in such a manner as should have made that
ancient lady claw up the top-board of her coffin and
get out to applaud him. We are not sure now that she
didn’t, for wo fancied we heard, just behind our seat, a
sound’ like that of hones rattled together. Perhaps,
however, this was only the chattering of our own teeth
at the recollection of Walter Reynolds’ lago. When
we say, as we believe we said a few lines back—we’ve
mislaid the slip of sugar-paper we were writing on—
that Mr. Sheridan played Ingsmar well, we are paying
a great tribute to his patience and determination
to* be thorough. This is about all we can say
without being prolix, and prolix we mver are—except
when the publican over the way asks us to square up
the little-bill we owe him. By the way, when we say
we pay Mr. Sheridan a tribute, it might be just as well
to stats candidly that this is the only thing we have
ever paid anybody. Miss Davenport, as Parthenia,
was more beautiful than the Greek beauty of that name
could be even if she stood on one foot for a year to do
it. We want to say something about this paloeolithie
play before we touch upon the acting. We know very
well that it has been spoken of before, but, as we don’t
reckon we have long to live, having read a Daily Tele-
graph leader this morning, we are going to have ns
much say as we can before the sexton dabs the clay
into our eyes. In this particular page, let it bn always
understood, we never consult previous criticisms nor
deal with any aspect of any play except in so far ns
accords with our own wisdom.
• • •
Which is limitless. Ingomar is a savage man
got up to look as tall as Dave Bachanau’s talk
when he gets on the Protection racket and sports a
wig that looked mighty like the scalp of either a poet
or n jnrrah timber hnshmau. The latter comparison
is strengthened by the fact that Ingomar s stately
keame is draped iu n wallaby-skin cloak, and his legs
bandaged up in what appear to be a number of longi-
tudinal slips from the hide of a Chinaman. This gentle
•reature falls in love witl>. Parthenia, as any man would
who had eyes. But he doesn’t understand exactly
whether the new feeling Ihat surges up in his 48.iuch
breast is the tough part of the op ssum he ate ti e day
before, or a presentiment that jarrah timber is going
up. Parthenia sits down and her shock-headed lover
watches the dear creature twining a wreath of flowers
_. S otue of which he had culled a few minutes previously
off the mossv slopes of the prompter s basket behind
the second wings.
• * «
Mr. Ingomar lays down the shovel-handle with
a flat iron on top which he facetiously balls a “ spear,”
drops
That targe
Whose tin-tag studs and tough paste hide
Have death so often dashed aside,
and falls a victim to the charms of the fair Massilian
maiden. She immediately mounts the scooped-out
pumpkin which he feelingly alludes to iu several places
as his “ helmet,” and grasps the spear, to equal which
the tallest gum hewn on the Tumut hills to he the mast
of seme great mud-dredge were but a tandstickor match
of the flve-boxes-for-tuppence sort. And then she
meanders out and he follows her, adown the vale of
obscurity, with the cabbage basket in bis manly paw.
• • #
As the Timarch of Manilla Mr. Frank Cates is
fairly good. So is Mr. W. H. Leake as Polydor. We
haven t got time now to say what the rest of the oast
are, for there is a dog-fight going to take place in our
back-yard in a few minutes and we’ve got a hook on it.
Perhaps the “rest of tha cast” will be just as well
pleased that we have said nothing of them,
* * * *
“ Youth ” we have very little to say about,
except that it is growing old on the boards of the
Royal. It is a strong proof of the present popularity
of spectacular plays that this one has had such a good
run. This remark is intended as a sort of vague
generality to take the edge off the very short notice we
are able to give the Royal this week. The play itself
we hare said all we wanted to say about, and Goodie
and Solomon, having reached the apparent possible
aeme of splendour and suavity attainable iu this life,
we have nothing new to say about them. Consequently
we are well out of the trouble of writing a long para-
graph. The attendance at the Royal is still good.
* * *■ *
Business at the Opera House is getting a bit
brighter. Mr. W. Horace Bent has been secured by
Mr. Kollar to assist iu giving variety to the entertain-
ment And he does it with a vengeance. His stump
speech on the Comic History of England is funnier than
any we have ever heard Dan O’Connor make in his
gravest moments. It is a mass of absurdities from
beginning to end. The most high and mighty figures
in the history of our glorious mother-country are taken
by the beard and pulled around as a policeman pulls a
blind man off a crossing. This is fun, if you like. We
are pretty chary of recognising nay fun but our own,
yet in this instance we are obliged to admit that Horace
is ahead of ns. However, we can’t play Moscsonas for
ever—so we shall have to ride along.
* * * *
Miss Marion Willis’s benefit, at the Victoria
Hall, on Friday night, was well attended. The.pieco
pub on for the occasion was “ Lady Audley’s Secret."
We wish Lady Audiey had kepc this dark all along.
The novel is bad and the play is worse, so that the
performance was worried through under difficulties.
But where the Willis there’s the way. And on the
whole the play was, despite all the diabolical absurdity
of the plot, pretty fairly rendered Less we could say,
more we won’t.

The Pollard Lilliputian Opera Company open
in—we believe —"Madame Angot,” on Saturday week,
at the Opera House. After them the Montagne-Turner
Opera Company play at this house of the lyric drama.
They open on the 9th of next month. We shall be
there.
* * * *
We started about a dozen times to see “ Jack
Sheppard” played at the Victoria Hall by the brilliant
Keogh and the coruscating Steele, with other members
of that phosphorescent company that mi. rated from the
Queen’s a little while ago But we never saw It. Fact
is we met Jack Sheppard himself, and we reckoned it
better fun to shepherd him through a hot whisky than
to go and see him play. J his miriit have been mauvais
gout on onr part, hut it tasted well at the time. Any-
how, our opinion of the matter is that if Jack Sheppard
had not been hanged a hundred years ago or there-
abouts—mostly thereabouts —for we are not a dictionary
of dates, and don’t want to he —he would have hanged
himself it he had seen the drama that was gouged out
of his history. This is all we ve got to say.
* * * *
Jimmy South’s Opera Company opens at the
Victoria Hall with “Pinafore” on Mob day next.
Jimmy was Williamson’s original Major General in the
“Pirates,” and has played Captain Corcoran in “Pina-
fore ” for the same illustrious entrepreneur. Mrs. South,
who is a dear little woman—of course this is said from
a goggle-eyed, gray-hairo I dramatic critic’s point of
view—p'ays Josephine. Vernon Reid, one of the
finest light tenors that we have in these lands, plays
Ralph Rackstraw. Sullivan sings the bass part, Emma
Rogers plays Buttercup, and Charles Tyreil—Admiral
Porter. The orchestra is, we are told (by Whitting-
ton, the agent), a large and good one. Madame Anna
King is the musical directress. The scenery is new,
and the mechanism c spied from the original models.

Yesterday evening a benefit was given|to Charley
M'Carthy at the Vistoria Hall. We were not there,
but we will be, because to-day is to-morrow, and we
can't get an account of the thing jammed into this issue,
though we have tried to bribe the overseer with a little
Bible and a volume of Dr. Watts comie songs to quietly
smuggle it in. Casting our eye over this last sentence,
we perceive it is a bit mixed. Those who don’t get the
hang of it, might do so by standing on their heads, and

taken cum Leopold Fane de Sails, for we have stood

we hope Charles will have or has had luck.

Baylesa, ’Frisco, to Eeynolds, Sydney :—“Been
’Frisco eight days—overflooded with calls. Theatrical
business good, but could only visit four theatres.
Signed rough drafts of engagements with Fritz
Emmett and Murphy; former arrives in Australia in
April; latter, in June. Concluded with huge Minstrel
Company (Clarke and Byman’s) which will be a big go,
its singing quartette being same who went to London
with Haverly ; tenor spoken of by London Press as a
wonder—they arrive 25th August, and open Sydney,
Saturday, September 2. Also concluded with Elite
Comedy Co., same style as Salsbury’s Troubadours
—they have eight new pieces. The printing sent with
the Minstrel Company will cause a big excitement in
Australia—it was cut for Haverly to take to London.
They bring with them an Irish jaunting car and two
beautiful cream-coloured horses. Stay in New York
only ten days." Mr. Bayless has arranged for a four-
teen months’ supply of novelties, and speaks enthusi-
astically of the piospects of his people in Australia.

On Tuesday evening, August 22nd, a grand
dramatic performance will be given by the members of
the Shakespeare Dramatic Club at the Burwood School
of Arts iu aid of the building fund. The piece to be
put on will he Byron’s “Our Boys." This will be
followed by a miscellaneous concert by local amateurs.

Macoabe’s guardian angel, the seraphic His-

hampton to prepare a place for his great principal.
Fred Maccahe is scooping the last half-crowns from the
Capricoruiaos’ pockets, and spreading an epidemic of
pain in the side. An outbreak of the same complaint
may be expected on his reappearance here. All the

Mr. J. H. Tyreil, of the Gem Dramatic Co.,
has written ns four quarto sheets of mingled remon-
Btranoa and reproof concerning our remarks regarding
his troupe. Mr, Tyreil says some very hard things
of us wnioh wo are now doiug our little Best to boar up
against. He says that we have made a number of
“venomous innuendoes" against his company. We
humbly venture to differ. We would as soon
think of going out of our way to kick a blind man’s
dog as to do any injury to him or his banl of “ Thes-
pians." Super-susceptible people are, as a rale, in-
herently weak; and any one wao tries to “ put a
head ’* on another should first have “ put a
head " on himself. Mr. Tyrol! says some bitter things
of his people. For instance, ha informs us that “we"
(the company) “ have dramatised most of our own
repertoire ." This, though an appalling statement of
itself, is an unconscious “ recognition of the power of
the law in Northern Queensland to prevent bloodshed."
We have occasionally chaffed, but, to the best of our
belief, have never injured Mr. Tyreil or his friends,
whom we idon’t personally know; and it affords ns
more joy than we can express in half a column to have
the inestimable privilege oi printing the following
extract from a letter which, Mr. Tyreil says, the
treasurer cf his crowd received from the secretary of
the School if Arts and Town Clerk of Mackay.
Writes that Northern Chesterfield :—“ X deeply regret
that, owing to the inclemency ot the weather, you
have not met with the support you should have had. I
can assure you, jours is the only company from whom
I have received couiteous conduct. I have tried to
make everything agreeable tojou and your company,
and I have been met with civil and most gentlemanly
conduct. It has been a great pleasure to me,to meet
with such civility, and I shall ever remember it." The
fellow who, in North Queensland, can write so lovely
an epistle must be a Dune iu disguise.

The Bandmann-Beaudet-D’Orsay-Ogden Com-
bination appear to be having a gay old time in Hong,
kong. A paper there, the Telegraph, (a very lively
production, by-the-way, and a contrast, therefore, to
our sick pennyworth ot ’busmen’s guyrer I), goes for
the crowd straight. They said, it appears, that Daniel
couldn’t play Hamlet as well as Irving, and that riled
the greatest tragedian iu the world. But the paper is
not content with ordinary criticisms. It calls him
“ Herr Von Trompethlomer,” and talas of his “Ome-
let." His Borneo gets “ jarro," and his Narcisse
“fits." The paper wants—what would bo easy to find
at a certain Sydney theatre—a “full" dramatic com-
pany. D'Orsay Ogden writes defending Bandmann,
and Daniel kicos out a Telegraph boy he finds behind
the scenes. Then, next day, D’Orsay, who has married
Miss Helen Fergusson—here’s their wedding ad. in all
its glory—“ On Sunday, 28ch May, 1882, at 9.30 a.m., at
the Cathedral, Shanghai, by the Rev. W. L. Groves,
Richard D’Orsay Ogden, of Richmond, Va., U.S.A., to
Helen B. Fergusson, daughter of the late John Fergus-
son, M.D., Adelaide, South Australia. (Cousin of Sir
James Fergusson, Governor of Bombay.) The bride
was given away by Mr. O. N. Denny, Consul-General
for the United States. A breakfast and reception at
the Astor House followed the ceremony.’’—“ goes for ”
an actor named Donaldson, and he and the fair Hglen
are summoned to the Police Court, the results being,
says the China Mail, that “ Mr. Ogden was fined $lO,
or three weeks’ imprisonment with hard labour; and
Mrs. Ogden §5, or fourteen days’ imprisonment with
hard labour.” It seems that Bandmann has grown as
fat as Falstatf, and during the performance of Romeo,
tha gods would insist upon calling out “ butcher," and
asking for the latest sheep’s-head quotations. When
the Daniel left Hongeong, he shook the dust off his
seven-leaguers on the Quay, and the air was thick with
curses. We hear, however, nothing of Beatrice,
although there is a rumour that she is in Bengal some-
where, managing the establishment of a rajah. Fancy
the divine Davis with a buueh of keys at her girdle,
tripping about in the basement of the palace, and
counting the jam-pots. We haven’t got a palacejyet,
but when we have, if Miss Beatrice has got a sister she
can send her along. We will pay tram-tare both ways.

Thus our correspondent:—“No Mercy” had
very hard iuok in Adelaide, and it deserved good luck.
Wet weather set in directly this play was put on the
boards, and jusD as people weie ready tor me theatre
heavy showers fell regularly and rendered the streets
so sloppy, and outgoing generally so disagreeable, that
I usual playgoers were forced to content themselves with
dulcc domum. Thanks, doubtless, to Giacometti, “No
Mercy” possesses coherence, passion, and dramatic
strength, Thanks to “theVag," it is sufficiently
varied and locally lightened to suit the average Aus-
tralian. We do not imagine that the idea originated
with the adapter, but certainly the introduction of an
aboriginal as a pot »nt factor in making fan is, nathiess,
a happy idea. Tuo scene of the last act was well
wrought out, and staged in saoh a manner a« to present
an entirely Australian appearance. Mr. Dampier in
the second act, as iho unfortunate Gerald Eyton, really
seemed to be the man ho was supposed to repre-
sent, and this is a remark which, however mnch
one may desire to do to, cannot incessantly be applied
to Mr Dampier’s work. Mss Adcre, with much appro-
priate action and gesticulation, has a delivery which
tells fatally against the accomplishment of anything
approaching an overwhelming success. Gerald’s wife
is a repulsively unnatural person, as the author fashions
her, and Miss Ad era's art is not sufficient to charm the
character into interested acceptation. Mr. Poole’s
King Charley, the aboriginal, is, as “ 1 he Vagabond"
himself says, a capital attempt at realisation. “The
Black Flag” was hoisted rather too soon for our peace
of mind, but it has served to give Mr. Sam Poole a
chance, of which he availed himself fully. His Sim
Lazarus shows him to bo a low comedian who may some
day hold a (high place on the colonial stage. Of the
play iteelflperhaps the less one says the better. But the
scenery supp.ied is for the most part new, and Messrs.
Dam|d ir and Carey support Mr. Poole admirably
Aioninald Forbes has Immense audiences at the Town
Hall. Even the orohestn seats, which are not sup-
posed to be at the service of a public entertainer, were,
on Monday night, crammed uncomfortably. People
were forced to stand on the pDtform and almost jostle
the lecturer’s elbows. No doubt curiosity to see the
man himself has mnch to do with the attendance, hut
Forbes' lectures bear the hall mark of genuineness, and
one feels that the man who speaks is the man who has
seen the scenes so fervidly depicted.
We are delighted to learn from the S. F. News
Letter that the Mendelssohn Quintette Clwb has re-
turned “ from an unqualifiedly successful tour through
the Australian colonies.'* [1 II]; and we read in the
Wasp of the same city, with an equal amount of
pleasurable surprise, that “Mr. Bay lias has “gained
the name of the Haverly of Australia," and that the
Gaiety, the “Wallack’s of Australia,” “together with
the Opera House at Melbourne, which is its outlet, ore
at the head of the amusement enterprises of Aus-
tralia." We fire also told of Mrs. Bayliss (who has
never played at the Gaiety in her life), that—“As
directress of the Gaiety she finds little time to grace
the boards as of old, but for a few weeks in every year
she re-enters the field of her former triumphs." After
this, we shall be melancholy if we do not receive our
American exchanges regularly. We can only got really
reliable information from those journals as to how
theatrical matters are getting along here.

' Writes our correspondent under date 3rd Aug.:
—For Mr. Thomas’ benefit last Saturday “No Mercy"
was staged again, and witnessed by a very large
audience. After the performance ho, “ the Yag,” ex-
pressed his appreciation of the efforts the company had
made, and, not having responded from the stage when
called for ny the audience, thought well to advertise in
Monday’s papers as follows: —
[a card.]
THE “ VAGABOND," thanks his many
friends who crowded the Theatre Koyal on
Saturday night to witness the performance of
“NOMBEOY.” He is sorry that he was un-
avoidably prevented from thanking them in
person from the stage.
An adaptation of “ Michael Stogoil" formed the bill-of-
fare on Monday. It is in seven acts, but .the crowd,
beluga holiday crowd, exhibited no particular symptom
of revengefulness, though Michael held the n in durance
from 7 45 to 11 30 p.m. This is what soma peop'e term
a pathetic commentary on the boasted civilization of
the nineteenth century I 7 he acting panorama itself
mignt be farther improved by boiling down into
two acts. The first act might, as at,
present, show how the Czar appoints Michael
Strogoff, his courier. The second act might bo
I moulded much after the fashion of the existing lost
act with the addition, say, of some hundred lines
written in a bold flowing hand, with a copying pencil,
and declaimed by Michael Strogoff. In this passage,
rendered sublime by the genius of, perhaps, a much
travelled actor, Michael would recount the adventures
through which he had passed while fulfilling the ardu-
ous avocation of a ” slave of Duty." He oonld feelingly
dilate on his splendid impassibility in denying hunt,.- f
a mother. He coaid relate as a fact that any man who
levelled a revolver at five pairs, tired, and thought
such a proceeding would render Michael Strogofl’s
visaera inoperative was mentally mendacious. He
could stats that a shell, with the fuse burnt low, but
added to life’s enjoyments, when carelessly fondled and
then tossi d i outemptuously away by the lithe Ungers of
the Courier of the Czar “on the burst.” He could
assert himsslf as capable of pushing down the walls of
a battlemented fortress, and declare that n red-hot
sword blade applied to his eyes bat increased the
power of his naturally wonderful eyesight. Thus the
actor—that is, the thoroughly capable aator—would
gain, and bo would the audience. Espedill.y tha
audierce, for, bv the simple moans suggested,
“ Michael Btrogoff ’’ could bo satisfactorily demon-
strated as a stago-effect in two acts by 9 o’clock.
These hints arc presented gratis to the next adapter of
Jules Verne’s remarkable story Hard-working Mr.
Carey is to have a benefit in a fortnight, and it is not
definitely known when the Dampier season
ends, and the ’-limonsen begins .Mr. Arohi-
bald Forbes has had crowded houses at the
Town Hall at every leoture. He is further taking an
interest in Adelaide affairs, and wrote a letter to the
Register two columns in length concerning the ques-
tion ot a site for the new Houses of Parliament. A
man who makes so many thousands by lecturing can
afford to be generous in the matter of “ copy’’ now and
then.

The standard of American theatre-managers’
morality does not seem —judging by the following stony
—to lie much higher than an ordinary mortal might
roach if he sat on a dynamite keg with a lighted cigar
in his mouth. Mr. J. R. Rogers la “running" Miss
Minnie Palmer, a popular actress, through the States.
When the company were in Chicago, the Herald came
out with a long article descriptive of nn interview one
of its reporters had with this lady. It starts to describe
how “the little woman pulled off her stockings, re-
moved her dress and petticoats, disclosing her figure
robed in a short white something trimmed with lace,
and a pair of cardinal corsets. Under this was a low-
necked, short-sleeved merino edged with crocheted
worsted lace; getting her arms out of the vest, she
pushed the whole thingdown ” This will do for the
present. The worst of the thing is that after half the
theatrical journals of the East had commented strongly
on the indelicacy of the account aud the looseness of
morals that allowed a mau to be admitted into Miss
Palmer’s dressing-room, Mr. Rogers writes to these
journals to the effect that no man was admitted, but
that a lady interviewed Miss Palmer on behalf of the
Herald. Mr. Rogers is accused of having had this
account published, by arrangement with the Herald,
as though written by a man, “merely to create a seusa-
tion, and give him (Rogers) a chance to come forward
and get a cheap advertisement by sending his indignant
explanations to the Press.” The whole affair is charac-
terised as a “put-up job.” If Mr. Rogers is really
guilty, he has no business to stay in the States. Let
him come over here, and he will be made a Licensing
Magistrate as soon as he sets foot on the wharf.

A SHORT ODE.
[LONG OW[?]D.]
Great Archibald, most justly called
Prince of war scribes alive—a
Scribe we cry but beaten by
M'Gahan’s Steppes to Khiva.
Great Forbes, whose orbs
Flash fire and ire
Like military rockets,
While you declaim wild deeds of fame.
And fill your breeches pockets,
We here may obaunt without a vaunt
Your praises and your pluck, Sir;
Though this South Land’s gold-sprinkled strand,
Bo far as grappling armies stand,
Yon find quite in the ruck. Sir;
Of Rurope’s shores where squadron’d scores
Of millions mangle redly,
Not clothes but men, and close again
la grip of battle deadly—
In rapt amaze we note the blaze
Of half-a-dozen orders
fo dress-coat pinn’d, as squarely chinned,
Erect, thick-neoned, and circumspect
You lecture in our borders.
Again with Skobeloff and you
We occupy the trenches ;
View Plevna and see Osman true
Witbstand all Russian wrenches;
March throueh Afghanistan’s fell puss;
Tramp miles into Bucharest;
Tread Isandula's gore-feu grass
Grown rank o’er Britain’s fairest;
Share in the ‘ baptism of fire’
’Tween France and France’s Masters
At Saarbiilck, and those days most diie,
Metz and Sedan’s disasters.
Still, Archibald, ride on with yon.
That memorable Sunday
(Was it not f) when the fierce Zulu
Reeled shattered at Ulundi.
And, faith, you are a man of war.
Yourself a trooper truly.
As you narrate aaus any prate
How you did duty duly.
We grudge you not the thumping “ pot ”
Made by your fervid lectures —
Most folks protect cash rights, why not.
Indeed, should you protect yours P
We may confess your great success
Will ne’er give us the vapours—
Yet hold jour hand and understand
Ere scribbling in our papers.
We read your words, which fly like birds,
As you may safely guess, man.
And publish loud that we are proud
Of each a brother pressman.
So go your ways and win fresh bays,
And bank colonial money,
And tell them home the honeycomb
Is Australasia sunny—
Where grow the orange and the vino,
Strong sons and daughters ruddy,
Whose lives with ptaoe will safe entwine.
While you scan Europe bloody.
Salve et vale, Archibald I
An earnest man Occasion-called—
Heaven keep you e’er from plying
Your dreadful trade in Adelaide :
Or where our harbour lying
Stout Sydney's boast gems this oast coast.
And never make your hell-bourne,
Where rare and fair, and debonnair.
Young, rich, and proud sits Melbourne 1
Then go and write of siege and fight.
Free Pen by Land of Mac sent,
And tell your tale, deep-voiced and hale,
With homely Scottish accent.
Behold 1 our gold *s gladly rolled
Into your lap, and know, man.
We now declare you past compare
A splendid Soldier-Showman.

This is penned “ without prejudice.” Some time
ago a certain Judge (who, strange to ray, was mueh re-
spected) had a most intricate lawsuit brought before
him ; and, not wishing to see the parties interested
swallowed up, body and soul and clothes, by the long-
robed sharks, ho advised them 'to settle it outside.
Soon after they returned, and said they were willing to
refer the case to the arbitration of three houest men.
The Judge replied that the case involved some difficult
legal points, which would require one of the referees at
least to have some knowledge of law, and he would
therefore suggest the propriety of employing one lawyer
and two honezt men. When that Judge died, every
lawyer within a radius of 400 miles went to his funeral.
They wanted to make dead sure he was “planted" so
deep and firm that he would never be able to get up and
sit on a bench again.
Edward Baly, the swoet singer of the Even
Snooze, has followed poor Kendall beyond the grave I
with the usual “ In Memoriam.” The first verso rips
along as follows :—
HENRY KENDALL.
The sky was clear, the air was still,
A sound came booming o’er the hill
In mournful monotone;
1 knew too well that distant bell
Was ringing out the parting knell
Of Poesy’s gifted son !
Edward must have very long, and very imaginative
ears. Not a " sound cimo booming o’er the hill” at all
—nothing but a faint breeze, as sad and gentle as the
troubled spirit it bore aloft, marked the death of Henry
Kendall, The distant boll was as dumb as a baked
“ gohanna.” If some fat old bishop, with a cash credit
of £100.000, had died, or if some political plunderer
was forced to “step along,” then the bell would toll,
and the sound boom, and then would we cover our
Sawbath clothes with crape, and go moving around
with the dejected air of codfish crossed in love. But
Kendall was simply a son of Genius, and he died as the
sons of genius ever will—poor and neglected, save by a
few staunch friends.
Now York reporter interviewing the Czar of all
Australia. “Do you ever interest yourself in the
political or social questions of other empires beside
your own?” Sir ’Ear/: “Oh, certainly. For
instance, I devote two hours’ thought a day to the
Hegyptian crisis. It was I who advocated the bom-
bardment ef Alexandria, and what was tho result?
The heuemy lost about 55,000 meu, whilst the British
didn’t lose any more than we kill in oue day on our
tram-lines. Then again, I warned Gladstone if Caven-
dish was sent to Ireland, assassination would surely
follow. I have had experience. I was assassinated my-
self once up Kiama way; you’ve heard of that before,
no doubt. Hirish alfairs ooupy me sometimes as late as
dinner time. Lately, the advisability of my putting
Cetewayo on hia throne once mare has caused me much
anxiety, but I have conquered troubles worse than that
ere now—that iMilbura Creek affair, for instance.
Your own little country I find also requires the sage
counsel of an experienced leader—of what Carlyle
would call a Deutsoherswhieftoreingerfoostenl erg or a
'master mind.’ I will see what I can do for America
when I finish with • the Boer troubles.’ ” Reporter :
“ Thanks. And now one other question. What makes
your nose so flat?” Sir ’Enry (with great dignity) :
“ Well, I presume it was so made in order that I might
not bo able to poke it into other people’s business ”
That closed the interview, as the New Yorker suduenly
remembered he had to meet a man just round the
corner. #
I When a number of influential blackfellows give
a banquet to one of their leading men, the festive guests
sit round in a circle, a. and go for the rain-water soup,
baked 'possum, devilled snake, and grubtartf, and after
gorging away until they 11 bust their bingies, and each
savoury joint is fully discussed, the dusky lords throw
whatever is left to the row of expectant “ gins”behind.
When the ladies are through, they hand the remains to
the “ piccaninnies" ; when these are satisfied, they pass
the balance over to the dogs, and when the dogs are
full—that’s all about it. Now, this is precisely the
plan of the Parkes’ banquet, so that although we have
nothing to learn from Britishers we can copy with
profit from our own blackfellows.

How sad to think an editor—that inspired being
whoso gigantic brain, and whose refined and “ oul-
chered ” sensibilities are the levers, so to speak, which
raise weak, grovelling men from this filthy world to
the pure delights of heaven—should possess such a
«• demnition” common-place, vulgar thing as a
stomach ! '.Couching a recent ball, held in the Orange
School of Arts, one of the rojthetic knights of the
scissors and paste up there hoists his readers’ souls as
follows” In the hands of the Decoration Committee
the hall was converted into a perfect fairy bower. Bare
walls and an unsightly ceiling were converted into a
scene of beauty by the aid cf ever-greens, ferns, plants
and flawera. The stage wag metamorphosed into a
perfect grotto, inviting the weary dancer to rest, and
productive of soft murmurings sweet to the ear when
the heart responds to the breathings of love.” How
lovely and romantic the Orange scribe’s ..description I
How it leads one back.to the days when the troubadour
sang his plaintive tale under the shade of the castle’s
fowl-house: we almost hear his mistress’ heart “ re-
spond to the breathings of his love wa can almost
gaze on the ginger-beer bottle full of rum which trou-
badours generally carried about in their pants; we can
almost sniil the aromatic scent of the onions which
they chewed to hide the place of their tonic’s conceal-
ment; and we can almost sea the bullet-headed old
baron creeping behind the amorous yelper and splitting
him from top to toe like ha would a boiled pumpkin.
What a genius the man must be who, in a few short
words, can recall »uch tender recollections. It is pain-
ful to read from the same glowing page that “ the
tables ware most bountifully and exquisitely supplied
with every conceivable delicacy, which were dispensed
by ready assistants.” And that “in the matter of
liquid refreshments,” everything was all that even a
newspaper reporter could desire, and no doubt they
were subsequently tho cause of as many soft “ mur-
murings ” as the romantic allurements of the "perfect
grotto.”

A fact. Reginald do Yere Ponsonby Jones was
innocent—very. He was badly shook on a daughter of
a wealthy harristicrat at the P’int. Taking a lounge
thro’ the Arcade one day he spotted a pair of what ha
took to be the latest thing in bangles. “The very thing
for Angelica,” he sighed, and dived into the shop and
purchased. He thought he had “had” the sales women
when she only demanded a few shillings as payment,
but he didn’t notice the mild titter of the other assist-
ants. That evening, when sitting alone with the
adored Angelica, he, in accents sweet as the cooing o 4
a cockatoo in corn time whispered, " Fairest dearest,
I have brought thee a little gif t-a trifling

Somebody ia sadly wanted to write a tract about

by his ma to borrow a sum of money from his uncle.
Although the Herald’s correspondent doesn’t expressly

THE DUMMY ERYSIPELAS.
Ye gods ! here comes another scare
To startle us and cripple us !
’Tis not this time the Russian Bear.
’Tis Dummy Erysipelas!
Have we not leeches, swift and keen,
To cheat, to rob, and nibble us,
That Satan must in his vile spleen
Seud Dummy Erysipelas ?
Some men on flattery or on wine
Seek but too oft to tipple ns ;
But ****** why lay down this mine
Of Dummy Erysipelas ?
Is not great Davies’ scare enough?
Is’t such a trifling quibble, as
That you should thus the Land Laws “ bluff ”
With Dummy Erysipelas ?
In faith, you sought a lion’s lair.
And proved yourself a triple ass,
When you invested in tho scare

That “ Base the slave who pays is P”
Then why should not a tradesman bleed
To honour groat John Davies P
The virtue of an honest heart
To no stiff rules a slave is ;
Then why should he be asked “ to part,”
Immaculate John Davies ?
The plebeian soul that will not pay,
Undoubtedly a knave is ;
But rank him not with common clay.
The god-like saint John Davies !
“ The King can do no wrong," you know,
A maxim old and brave is
Then how dare you attaint him so,
His Maiesty, John Davies ?
His palisaded name and fame
Far ’bove the common wave is ; (
To mortals he is not “ fair game,”

Then, from amongst us vulgar throng,
All that wo truly crave is.
With generous Bradford’s iron s'.reng
You’ll palisade John Davies !

BAILEY’S BATTLE.
A BALLAD.
“ A fracas occurred yesterday between Mr.
W. H. L. Bailey, of the Temora Hebaid, and Hr,
Orbell, an auction ear, who is secretary to the Jockey
Club. The ground was very wet at the time, owing to
the recent rains.” — Sydney Wire.
Hail, gentle muse I and wing thy flight
On beams of bright Aurora,
While we sing of bold Orbell’s fight
With Bailey of Temora.
Now, Bailey has a little sheet
(It’s time he should be wary !),
And he wrote “things” we won’t repeat
About the Seer e-iary.
Then Orbell Bailey meets (small B.
Had but his “ umborella").
When Orbell “ up” his fist, did he.
And smacks B. in the “smeller.
B. strikes a blow, back to the wall
(It was not well-directed);
And to the winds are scattered all
The ads. that he’d collected.
Bang, bang, they fight, each man of wind
Too short a word to utter ;
“ Hurroo!” the crowd shrieks from behind.
As both roll in the gutter.
“ I’ll kill you 1” 0. does loudly yell.
As waged the battle bloody;
B. couldn’t speak, for it befel
His mouth was far too muddy.
“ Whoop 1 give it him 1 Now have his blood 1 ”
Tha misoreants all shouted;
Then thicker both got caked in mud,
And—that is all about it.
“ I’ve marked him well,” quoth little B.,
As, later, people washed him ;
“ That Bailey chap I long to see,”
Cried Orbell, “ how I've smashed him i ”
That night they both met in the show,
And each was in confusion.
For neither showed —it was a blow —
The tiniest contusion.

of money” protested that s’help him, he hadn’t more
than sheven roubles in the house, and besides the watch
wouldn’t go, and the gown had been turned. Anyway
Nicholas got the sum of money, and instead of taking it,
as he ought, straight to his parents, with the ticket,
he yielded to the voice of the tempter, and want to
church with the money on his person. The immediate
result may be easily anticipated. The evil associates
whom the erring lad founft at this haunt quickly re-
lieved Lim of his treasure. He was robbed in the
church or else swindled by aconfldenceman with a shaven
upper lip and a oollection-plate trick. On awakening
to a sense of his folly and misfortune, the wretched
Nicholas, afraid to confess that he had been robbed,
took a desperate resolution, and, with his little
hatchet—he seems to have been a regular George
Washington in the matter of hatchets —killed his
father. On hearing the sufferer grunt, the mother
entered the room, and, seeing the prostrate form,
sternly inquired of Nicholas—“ Who chopped down the
old mau ?" Nicholas hesitated for a moment. Then the
noble boy, drawing himself up to his full height, said
resolutely:—“ Mother, I cannot tall a lie, I out down
the old buffer, with my little hatchet 1” Having thus
spoken, he spat on hisjhands* and cleft his mother’s
skull, and, his sister entering at the moment, he
chopped her up too. Now, dear young friends,
what do we learn from this? If Nicholas had
returned straight to his parents, and had
avoided evil company, and shunned church,
his money would not have been stolen, be
would not have been insensibly led into the farther
indiscretion of killing his father ; he would not have
been caught in the act by his mother, and driven to the
sin of telling the truth to her—thus rendering it neces-
sary to open her mind with a tomahawk ; and his sister
might have been alive to this day, and married to the
local preacher—possibly the very man who had *' col-
lected" the money from Nicholas—so that the coin
would have bean kept in the family after all. There-
fore, dear young friends, after popping the flat-irons,
neHer go to church. Taka warning from the fate of
Nicholas—avoid the immoral enticements of Pitt-street
on Sundays—and take the tram to Botany, where
innocent intoxication and threo-up will pass the time,
and prevent the mind from dwelling on the enjoyments
of murder.
You have all heard about that strange Herber-
ton animal, dear readers, who had a fata like a bull-
dog, a body like a wallaby, and who lit his pipe with
the tip of his tail. He killed four dogs, and (so goes
the report) it took six revolver-shots to kill him.
Well, we’ve got at the secret of it at last. It seems
that a fancy ball was to be given—the first —in Her-
barton, and the editor of the paper, taking advantage
of a dramatic company being there, borrowed a lot of
*• props ” and wont into the bush to try them on. When
the dogs attacked him, they nipped his calves, and
died of their own accord. As they flaw at him, the
editor smiled. He knew what the effects of Queens-
land rum would be. As for the revolvers, six shots
were certainly fired at him, and they all took effect,
with wonderful [precision, in the neighbouring trees.
Then the shootists all fell down on their knees and
raid their prayers, when the editor suddenly disclosed
himself. On this, seeing that the laugh would be
against them, each sportsman bribed the editor with a
quarter’s subscription, down, to invent the animal
yarn. The newspaper man, of course, gladly con- I
sented, and is in high glee. It he only has the luck to I
have a few mere degs set at him, and be a target for 7
half-a-dozen more revolver shots, he will be in a 9
position to buy a new hat. Thus is the secret ont! S
“ Doctor, I want yon to tell mo what is the

When old Jack Backblock, of Greatgunbolt, was

district a big “blow out,” with (silver billies of “fizz” to
wash the stuffing down. Jack's health was proposed by
the boss beak. Two strong arms held Jack in his seat
during the delivery of the oration and the swilling and
singing that followed; bat when everybody was re-
seated, great difficulty was experienced in getting Jack
on his feet. Up, however, he at last got, glass in hand,
and after surveying his breathless guests, giving him-
self a shake together, clearing his throat and smacking
his lips, he said—” Here’s luck, lads,”

A certain reverend gentleman, who recently
loft the Northern colony, has boon entrusted by the
Queensland Government with the task of sending ont
from England to Ban anal and fifty tailors. We are
glad to find that the Church, and not the devil, is on
this occasion among the tailors. No donbt his
reverence has undertaken the job from rmrely patriotic
motives ; still, it must fee remembered that the average
parson, without his tailor, would, like the rest of us,
ha but a soiry spectacle. Tailors are scarce in bydney
just now, and it is with much ploisnre that we see the
Queensland Immigration Department taking staps to
provide us with sartorial talent.

This is a fact. Amongst the diggers on the
Turou there was a party of four, and one of them who
had been troubled with epilepsy was liable at any time

One night after two m-rnths’ proepeotiag and when
damper was getting dam cer-ably scarce, the motes

There’s a family at Darling Point who, since

The old Rockhampton Quarantine Station was
on Curtis Island, a re-uarkably healthy spot in Keppel
Bay. Some time back, however, a wise and paternal
Government oau-ed the station to be transferred to
Mackenzie Idaud at the month of the muddy Pitzroy.
Thin ohansre was [mainly owinir to the fact that the
Health Officer was a “ martyr” to sea-sickness, and, in
ocnseqaeace, suffered severely during his frequent trips
across the bay. As a proof of the benefit that unfortu-
nate “ new chums” derive from the “ change," it may
bo stated that whan the now buildings were in eourse of
erection, “ old hands” were unabie to work during any
part of the day without first lighting fires for the pur-
pose of raising a smoko to scare away the mosquitoes.
“ May every horror that over darkened the

ism and shrivel the processes of his life; may his body
be smitten with boils, which, in comparison with those
of Job, shall be as the festering corrosion of universal
corner to Elysium j may his children oome to the
gallows only to jibe at bis last struggles, and may the
rats of remorse gnaw at his heart for ever and ever,

in reference to the lodger down below who has been
murdering “ Long, Long Ago,” on a piano for the last

In one of the coaches to Springsure sat a judge,
his niece, and two tailors Mile after mile, and not a
word could the genial tailors get out of the dignified
travellers. At last a smash oame, and a tailor leapt
oat. Oa re-entering the coach, the lady, alarmed, said,
“Pray, sir, is anything broken?” “Yes, ma’am,”
replied Von Needle, “the monotony,” At the next
hotel, his Honor made some remark to the landlord and
our glasses clinked, and before the journey was over,
the tailors had ascertained that the lady was a beauty
and a wit. At parting, the tailors wrung the judg«» s
hand, and aswured him, over a last; drop of aonaefchink,
that they’d be hang >d if they ever met so good a judge.
And his Honor laughed and said he agreed with them.
“ They’d be hanged if they ever did.”
It was up North, and there was a show there—
the Imperial something of Star Artists. About nine

your people are in already, and they and their families
fill up the three first rows of the front seats. “ Well,
then! suppose I must pay,” said the paper man—" half-
price, though." And he put down half-a-erown, and
walked in. Later, the check-taker was congratulated
by his hoes upon his acumen In “besting a Woomin

heard saying to his clerk : “ Tack an extra half-crown

The proper place to die “respected by all who

of Terrors was busy in oar town during the week,
having laid his clammy hand on Mrs. EM, an old and
respected resident; ami also the infant daughtertf Mr.

painful; but having lived the life of a good Christian—
ever striving for that ‘ tabernacle not nr ade with hands,
eternal in tha heavens ’—the sad message was received
with joy, for as the soul winged its flight, a serene ex-
pression rested on onr departed sister’s face that pro-
claimed the unspeakable happiness that was now its

At Carcoar, Barrington Emmery, who was about

a kerosene tin and an iron-clad boot-heel constituted a

A man died recently in Oampbelltown. At tbe
inquest it was apparent that everything had been done
for him that was possible. “ A doctor’s" (wo quote
the paper) “ assistant had attended him several times,
and given him medio.ne;” and, in the coarse of her
evidence, his 'ister said : " X gave him three teaspoon-
fuls of the medicine produced and, when he became
worse, she " helped to lift him up and administer
stimulants (sic) j and applied hot fermentations (sic).”
In spite of all this—in spite, particularly, of the assist-
ant’s medicine —the patient died Whi-n he was dead,
however, the doctor came, and, at the inquest, tha jury
returned the t Bowing verdict:—” Syncope caused by
getting up too soon, and over-exertion while the lung and

Tbe very latest teetotal drink up Queensland

the lot with sulphuric acid, coal-tar, and pain-killer,
and boil over a slew fire for hal'-an-hour. Then add
one pint of nitro-glyoerine, two quarts of kerosene oil,
three gallons of the oil of vitrol, and a little turpentine
to flavor. Have ready in another boiler a few boa con-
strictors, the essence of three rattlesnake s, half a pint
of prussic acid, and a gallon of Farmer’s Friend, or
Potcie’s Highland Oil. Mix all together, stirring
briskly, ana then strain through a three-rail fence, and
bottle off when cooling. If required for immediate use,
sprinkle lo ozj. o( dynamite ov,r the top, and sweeten
with a little atafoetida This makes a moat pleasing

Whenever an immigrant ship arrives in Harvey's

Queensland this tender regard for female virtue on
tne part of Hurley and Sheridan is regarded as ex-

A good while ago now, a vacancy occurred in a
Sydney a gentleman belonging to the paper
having pa*«cd peaceful : y away on “the 11 ooks” after
having devoured his boot uppers and drank his last pro-
curable half-pint of kerosene. So one morning the
proprietor, after mueh brow-turrewing and little-flnger
smearing with a tongue accompaniment, prepared the
following manuscript, which he gave to his advt. clerk,
and requested him to have put immediately under an
“ appalling catastrophe,” In the inside page :—
*• Wasted, a Dramatical Cricket to make himself
general useful. Must know how to put french
words in, and rite a good hand.”
Next merning. three individuals presented themselves,
and wore ushered in. * Are vou coves the dramatical
cricket! ?” said the boss. “Yes, sir," said the two
flrsr, who were tall and gentlemanly men. “We bar,”
ejaculated the small, mean man in cloudy moles, who
brought up the rear. The boss shot towards him a
glance of approval. “ Now,” said the gifted litterateur,
“ what do you think is the chief duty of a dramatical
cricketP” “To wjp.o fearless and straightforward
nieces, infusing into the critiques a vein of satire or of
humour when the subject appears to demand it,” said
the first one. “ Whit’s yours,” continued he tojthe
second, faintly. “I cm only echo the sentiments of
the gentleman who has spoken,” he replied. “ And
yours ?’’ once more cried the proprietor, nodd ngtothe
third. “To prevail ou the proprietors of the thru res
to give the rag plenty o’ bloomin' hads,” was the
prompt reply. “Rightl” shouted the boss: “go up.
You’re engaged.” And five minntes later the new
recruit was merrily tripping through the streets to
fetch his new master’s noonday snack from the pie-
shop.
A correspondent of the D.T. says that Protec-
tion is what is wanted here—had we the Cabbage-garden
political panacea in full swing we’d net see so many
unemployed banging about our streets. The D. T ’a
correspondent has evidently not visited Cabbage-garden-
opolis for some time. The seediest loafers known in
any city are those who in the morning assemble round
the newspaper office ‘ boards,’’ and read the labour ad-
vertisements. and who in the evening stroll towards the
soup kitchen A man who insists on getting a free read
of a journal must be mean. Wt.ll, the fellows who in
Sydney road the papers “on the never," are in get-up
as Emperors unto hodmen when compared with their
brethren of the South. Sydney loafers are mostly fat.
The Melbourne loafer is i: scarecrow. He’s such a
mean creature that he’ll even take a free read of a
halfpenny newspaper. They have c halfpenny news-
paper over in Meli ourne, hue we of Sydney have not yet
fallen so low as that, though we have one paper which
isn’t worth a farthing. Some time ago a Sydney man
went over to Melbourne, and, seeing at The Argus
office two score of loafers industriously spelling out tha
“ Wanteds,” thought he’d tee what the crowd was
made of. So he pushed his way through the thropg in
a very business-like style, jelled out “Staud back
there!” and deliberately turmd the face of the board
to the will, saying: “ What do yon mean by standing
here t® read this newspaper P Why don’t you go and
buy it P The price of The Aeous is two-pence. Clear
ou‘, now, all of you—go away, or I shall call a polici •
man Don't you know men work all night to produce
the paper you’ie trying to read for nothing—now be
off I* Aad every mother’s son of them was off as fast as
his pair of pipestems could carry him.
The Canadian papers to hand give full details of
Hanlan’s hluess. On June 3rd he was very ill, and Dr.
Macfarlane, who was in attendance on him, gave it as
hi l verdict that the oarsman was not tnffnring from an
attack of any marked and decisive type. The physician
considered his patient was ill from a generally feverish
tarn, arising, in all probability, from tie chill Hanlan
took when, after rowing on the Harlem river, he, as
already announced in these columns had to wait sora j
time before he could get any clothes to put on, the
“ gentleman” who had them in charge having taken a
short walk and forgotten the ipoint to which he had to
return. Sunday and Monday, Juno 4 and 5, saw the
champion mending, and Dr. Macfarlane considered that
the fever was broken, but Hanlan continued very weak
and despondent at the postponement of the Boss race.
Wallace Boss, being asked if ho would postpone hia
race with Hanlan, set for July 3, said he was anxi >us to
do wkat was right, but he had been at a good deal of
expense in training, and found every penny of hte own
money, and was not then prepared to say exactly what
ho would dr. On the same day a more favourable
bulletin was Uened about the patient, who was said to
show farther signs of improving. Dr. Macfarlane, how
ever, in spite of this change, now made up his mind,
from the various symptoms pr< ant id, that Hanlan
had really been Buffering from an a tack of typfcoii
fever, A few days afterward?, on the Bth June, the
Winnipeg Begatta was declared off, and Hanlan thin
had hopes of being able to leave hia bed in the com so of
a week or ten days.
WHAT HE WANTED.
There lay upon a truckle-bed
(Of twelve ’twa? near the quarter),
A oag of shavings ’ueath his head,
A weary-worn reporter.
Lo, suddenly he ope’d his eyes.
And then a vision sighted ;
A fairy of the smallest size
Upon his conch alighted.
*< Choose what then wonld’st on earth,”
The fay, in musical tones, chanted i
“ Choose, mortal—never mind the worth—
For what, no if, hast bhon panted ? ”
Tbe aoribe then scratched his touzled head.
And gave his eyes a rub j
“ I only, swe'test fay," he a*.ld,
” B'unt credit at the pub.”

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
At a meeting of the Victorian Racing Club on
Bth August, Captain Standish was elected chairman
for the ensming year.
Mr. C, Roberts’ horse, Masquerade, is reported
to hare done a good gallop, and ia now first favourite
for the Hawkesbnry Handicap.
30,000 paople witnessed the second day’s play of
the match Australians v. Gentlemen, and, probably, a
larger attendance was never seen at a match in
London.
The printers are to have their Cup contests next
erieket season. A preliminary meeting has been held,
and employers are to bo asked to contribute to the
trophies.
The races for the N.S.W. Association Annual
Regatta, in October, are to he:—Senior Sculling Race,
Senior Sight-oars, Junior four-oars, Maiden four-
oars, Scholars’ four-oars.
The Queensland football team visited the Bine
Mountains on Monday, and were provided with a
special saloon carriage by the Railway Department.
An enjoyable day was passed—zigzagly so.
On next Thursday the Australians’ return
m&toh at Clifton with Gloucestershire will be com-
menoed and continued on Friday and Saturday. Next
Monday week the match of the season—England v.
Australia—will be commenced.
On to-day (Thursday), the Australians will play
at Portsmouth against an eleven composed of paat and
present University students. This match will be con-
tinned on Friday and Saturday. There is no fixture for
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
A wrestling match for -£lOO aside takes place
on Saturday at the Hippodrome, Pitt-street, between
William Hudson, light-weight champion of New
Zealand, and George Cowan, ohampien of N.S. Wales.
The catching is to be the Cumberland style.
The Victorian bicyclists object to the Sydney
Bicycle Club organising a race for the chamiponship of
Australia, on the grounds that there is no proper racing
track in Sydney, and that Melbourne is better situated,
and has all the facilities for a contest of that de-
scription.
The Wallaroo Football Club has [decided to
postpone th e sports meeting till next season, the date
fixed, next Saturday, being required for the football
match. Wallaroo v. Brisbane, and the Association
ground not being available at any other date for the
present season.
William Edwards has challenged Charles A.
Harriman, or any other walker in America, to walk six
days’ fair heel-and-toe, for from £2OO to £5OO a side, and
he offers £75 for expenses for the match, to take place
in Australia. As an earnest of his intentions, he has
deposited £lOO with the editor of the Melbourne
SrOIITSMAN.
The Balmain Rowing Club has been admitted
iato the N.SW. Rowing Association notwithstanding
that the club allow “ manual labour" men to row as ama-
teurs. However, in races under the auspices of the
Association, these “ amateurs’* will not he permitted to
row. though provision will be probably made for special
races for them.
The first meeting of the newly-formed Albion
Park Jockey Cub was hold at Wollongong on the
10th August. The Hurdle Race was won by first Try,
who also won the flving Handicap. The Maiden Plate
was won by Young Valentia. Jenny Lynne (late Light-
foot) won the Macquarie Handicap, and Arrow the
forced Handicap.
Our invincible Eleven are marching through
England, like Sherman through Georgia; or a war-
horse through bulrushes ; or a mower through a field of
standing oats; or a hurricane through timbered
country; or a bull through a china-shop; «r well,
we had just gob so far when the footman brought us a
wire about the result of the Players’ match.
Ramsay, who plaved such havoc amongst the
Australians’ wickets in the Cambridge match, is a slow
bowler, with a good break, and gets up pretty fast from
the pitch. The two umpires in this match were W. H.
Stephenson, who was one of the first All England
Eleven that visited Australia some 20 years ago, and S.
Carpenter, who was one of Parr’s team in 1861.
The contest for the twenty-five mile professional
bicycling championship of the World between F.
Wood, of Leicester, and R. James,of Birmingham, came
off on 24th June, at Leicester, and was won by James
by three yards in 1 hour 20 min. 15 secs., beating the
previous best on record made by J. Keen on 23rd
August, 1880, his time being 1 hour 19 min. 35 secs.
Recently a Muffs’ football match took place at
Albury, for the benefit of the hospital; or no, not
that—fur the benefit of its funds, we mean. It was
a groat success, though the ball had most of the
fun all through. No goals were kicked, and nobody
won, but there were 500 onlookers, who had a healthy
laugh over it, and the hospital will no doubt benefit
when the players get more used to the game.
June 3rd will probably long remain memorable
for the two amateur bests on record at a mile accom-
plished on that afternoon; W. O. George, at Lillie
Bridge, running a mile in 4 min. 19 2 5 seo., beating his
own previous record of August 16, 1880, by no less than
3 3-5 sec., and H. L. Cortis, on the Crystal Palace track,
riding a mile eu a bicycle in 2 min. 43 1-5 see., beating
easily both the amateur and professional record.
The Balmain Waratah C.G. held their annual
meeting last week. Mr. S. H. Hyam was unanimously
re-elected president; Alderman Kenniff, rice-president;
Mr. J. Burke, honorary treasurer; Mr. L. Julian,
honorary secretary, vice Mr. J. Kallian, who had re-
signed. Working committee: Messrs. M'Carthy, J.
tfordham, and Lewis. Mr. J. Franklin was elected
captain for the season, and Mr. G. Brittell vice-captain.
Layoook was not in first-class condition when he
rowed for the Sportsman Cup. Largan was no
better ; he went amiss the day before the race and had
to be dosed with brandy and port wine before he could
attempt racing at all. He told his friends not to back
him, as ho doubted his ability to go more than a mile
and a half. Nothing but pluck and courage sustained
him through the heavy race he hod to pull, and he
finally won by two lengths. At the start Laynock was
a hot favourite. The conduct of the two Australians
was severely commented upon by the pnblio.
The committee appointed to manage the con-
tests for the Francis Punch Bowing Trophy have fixed
the dates for Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, 3rd,
sth, and 7th October, providing suffioient entries be
received for three days’ racing; otherwise the contoets
will take place on the sth and 7th October. Entries
will be received at Punch’s Hotel, on Saturday, 16th
September, between 8 and 0 p.m. Laycook, Pearce,
Largan, and Kush have intimated their intention to
take part in the contest. Doubtless Triokett will also
take part. The prizes are £290, £7O, aad £3O.
Commenting on the race for the Sportsman Cup,
the London Sportsman says” Layoook, wo fear, is
not the man, so to speak, he was on the occasion of his
last visit to this country. Im rowing parlance, ke Is
“ finer drawn,” and his long sweeping stroke seems to
laek power. Up to Hammersmith he seemed to be
rowing well within himself, but then it became appar-
ent that he was tiring, and shortly afterwards he grew
very sick." Other papers follow in the same strain.
How easily the critics can find fault with a beaten man.
hut what a handful of dollars Layoook must have
scooped by his race with Boyd ! Wily Elias 1 Thou hast
spoilt the Egyptians.
The following regarding C. T. Studd, who has
been performing in a most remarkable manner in t ng-
land, will be of interest to our readers : - He is a fine
athletic young fellow, about 6tt hi*b, and, using his
long reach to the utmost, comes down on the ball with
a wristy and resolute stroke. He outs well, hits to leg
well, drives well, and is, in the opinion of many good
judges of cricket, second to bo bats a an in England. He
is twenty-two years of age, and besides being such a
splendid bat, is (said to be a “ thorough good fellow,'’
being a great favourite with everyone. He can also
bow), being a right handed, medium-pace, ovor-arm
bowler, with a slight break back.
On Friday, the Old Lady must evidently have
turned on the wrong Missionary. Of Thursday’* races,
the rev. gentleman says " Most of the races were won
bg outsiders ” In their report however, Eowley tells
ns that the Hurdle Eaoo was won by Last Try, a hot
favourite ; the August Handicap by Cetewayo, ditto,
ditto; the Corinthian Cup by Last Try. first again in
the betting; and the Selling by Why-Not, which the
11 books" would hardly lay against. Only the Winter
Handicap was therefore won by an outsider. However,
on consideration, small blame can be attached to the
paper. One can’t expect Missionaries to attend race-
meetings. At least, not openly.
The English papers, whieh have been prating
about the luck of orioket. and finding all sorts of
excuses for the defeat of the Gentlemen by the Aus-
tralians, have now a gloriens eppertunity of eating
their own words, or else of offering the same excuses
for the Australians’ defeat by the Players. The Gen-
tlemen were without their fast bowler (Evans), the
Australians lost the services of Sp'florth; the Austra-
lians went in first against the Gentlemen, the Players
won the toss from the Australians. It will bo amusing
to watch the tone ot ths same journals when they have
to comment upon the Players’ match. We shall
doubtless hear something more about ths supremacy
ot English cricket. That point has not teen touched
since the Gentlemen’s defeat.
It now seems that the Henley Regatta Com-
mittee were, after all, blameless in the matter of their
refusal to accept the entry of the Hillsdale (American)
crew. No one can censure the committee for refusing
again to take a post entry after the warning given by
the Cornell crew difficulty last year The rule that
foreign entries should bo made by the Ist of May in
each year was not passed without good reason, since
precedent clearly shows that the bond fidea of foreign
amateurism need sometimes to be closely investigated,
and the rule, having once been made, should be adhered
to. Last year there was some excuse on the part of the
Cornell crew; but for a crew from the same country to
again plead ignorance is very properly not recognised
by the committee as sufficient reason for again stretch-
ing a point by foregoing the rule in their favour.
“ Twopenny,” the aboriginal cricketer, who
made a name for himself some years ago, was, in King
street, the other day, asked by a Newtown man if he
was going to "shout." “ I don’t mind,” said "Two-
penny," at the same time letting out a terrific
•> Coo-e-e-e 1” About twelve months ago “ Twopenny ’’
was in Punch’s bar, where Professor Miller was about
to leave some heavy dumb-bells and cannon-balls for
inspection. Several present tried to lift a two-hundred
pound shot on to the bar but failed. “Twopenny”
stepped forward, and, with the greatest ease, landed the
shot. The hat was sent round, and about 7s. were
placed in it. Next morning "Twopenny" turned up
without the price of a “ shout," and, when asked by
"Ned” what he had done with his money, said: "I
wont down the bay and them black beggars robbed me."
The N.S.W. Coursing Club’s Metropolitan meet-
ing at Booty Hill passed off most successfully, with the
exception that some of the greyhounds were badly cut
and bruised owing to the hardness of the ground. The
attendance was not large. Mr. Pitt’s judging gave
universal satisfaction, and Pratt was very successful in
the alios. The Consolation Stakes was won by Messrs
Lee’s Larrikin, with Messrs. Hall and Kite’s Huntress
as runner-up. Mr. A. L. Park’s Pickerel won the Sap-
ling Dog Stakes, with Mr. A. Town’s Tamerang ae
runner-up. The big event, the Woollahra Cup, was
won by Mr. A. L. Park’s Patloeoo, with Mr. W. Cooper's
Captivity as runner-up. Messrs. Lee’s Latest News
pulled efl the Cumberland Stakes, Mr. B. Bladen’s Bird-
ling beiner rmmer-np. The Sapling Bitch Stakes was
wob by Mr. A. L. Park’s Past Hope, Mr. A. Town’s

understand Triokett He came to America, and was
taken in charge by Mr. Reed, of Saratoga, and no man
could possibly be treated better, and the same was the
case at Toronto and St. Louis, yet he was always _con-
plaining. At Toronto ho rowed in ths prof jssional
race, and made a good show, but was beaten by Courtney
and Conley, who are better oarsmen than he is.
Triokett is a very peculiar fellow, and, indeed, I should
not be surprised if he committed suicide. He would
row anybody it he could get the backing. Kmnedy,
Courtney, Davis, and Gaudaur are all better men than
Triokett, and could beat him easily. As to the English
senders, Boyd is by far the best of the lot, but we have
plenty of men who can defeat any of the present Bag.

The Tattersall’s Club August meeting passed off
successfully, at Eandwiok, on Saturday. The
Hurdle Race was considered a gift for Last Boy,
bnt Basilisk forced the running, and whoa the
former got on even terms with him in the straight,
he waslunable to land the money for his backers, Basi-
lisk winning by a head. 21 started for the Tramway
Handicap, Kaffir being slightly the favourite, but a
brilliant race ended in favour of Twilight, Hypatia
second, and Balmoral third. Kanaka won the selling
race easily by a couple of lengths from Balthazar, West
Country Dick being a bad third. 16 horse* started for
the Tattersall’e Two-year-old Stakes. Halifax, getting
the beet of the start, was never headed, the favourite,
Statesman, being second. 14 horses started for the
Lottus Handicap, for whieh Hypatia was made a strong
favourite. Balmoral, late Euchre, was well ridden by
Nicholson, and came home a winner by a length;
Hypatia, finishing gamely, ran second, followed by ,
Rupert, third, a couple of lengths behind.
On the 27th Juno, Wallace Ross challenged the
winner of the Laycook-Boyd race then pending, to row
over the Thames championship course three months
after signing articles for £2OO aside. Layoook, before
the race, declined, haring already taken his passage for
Australia, but offered to row Boss on the Parramatta
Hirer for from £2OO to £SOD aside, as well as meet him
in the race for the Punch trophy. Eoes rrjoined that
Laycock had noocaasion to reply, as he had challenged
the winner, and he wanted to hear what Mr. Boyd had
to say to it. Bespecting haycock's intentions or
arrangements ho wished to know how much praise was
due to haycock •* when ho (smoking a cigar, which
Alderman Walker asked him to put out) walked up into
Hanlan’s room at the Star and Garter on the Saturday
preceding the Trickett procession (May 1) and very
persistently challenged Banian to row for £2OO a side in
two months, in spite of the announcement in the
Sportsman and other papers that Hanlan had arranged
to leave on May ll—subsequently postponed to the
15th. Judging by Lay cook’s last performance on the
Thames, it was a lucky thing for him that Hanlan
could not stay here, and, as subsequent events have
proved, equally unlucky for Hanlan." But how about
“Mr. Boyd” now P
The Sydney Turf Club have hit upon an excel-
lent plan by holding their meeting before instead of
after the great metropolitan meetings. The interest
and excitement used to be moribund when the big
events were over, and the Turf Club racing was, in
every respect, “ flit.” But now, the flame is fanned
and more interest is taken by many who hope to get a
line for the Bandwick nmd Hawkesbury events. The
hurdle racers ought to consider these preliminary meet-
ings as a rort of sop to Cerberus to help them over the
“ sticks." Mr. Thomas Field’s Last Try won easily
the Hurdle Bace, Hr. Nash's Satellite being second. A
fast race took place for the August Handicap, which
was won by Mr. T. Brown’s Gateway©, Mr. E M’Carty’s
Vanquish being second, and Mr. J. Onus’ Bob Sawyer
a length behind, third. Last Try ea«ily negotiated a
second win in the Corinthian Cup, Mr. T. L. Baker’s
Decision being second, Mr. B. House's Spark, the
favourite, third. Mr. Q. Vaughan’s Why Not won
the Selling Plate rather easily, Mr. J. Cornwell’s West
Courtney Dick being second, and Mr. T. Ivory's Game-
cock third Twenty started for the Winter Handicap,
Saionara was freely backed, but he dropped back half-a-
mile from home, and a splendid race between Mr. J. J.
Pearce’s Balmoral (late Euchre) and Mr. J. Dalton’s
Twilight resulted in favour of the former by a head.
Mr. W. B. Hall’s Cunnamulla came with a rush at the
finish and secured third place.
The iustralians had splendid weather for their
match at Canterbury against the “ men of Kent.” The
attendances were large except on the third day. The
home team were as follow* :—C. P. Wilson, M. C.
Kemp, W. H, Patterson, B. W. Ford, Lord Harris, E.
S. Jones, F. A. M'Kinnon, E. F. S. Tylecote, Lips-
combe, G. G. Hearne, and Wotton The Australians
won the toss, and the first batsman, Bannerman and
Massie, made a long stand. Murdoch was stamped for
0. Blaokham and Jones played splendidly. The wicket
was lively and suited the Australians, who made 307
Blackeam, 62; Jones, 59; Massie, 51; Bannerman, 47;
Boyle, not out, 27; Giffen, 25; M'Donnell, II; Horan,
6; Garrett, 8; Palmer, 0; Murdoch, 0; sundries, 13
Wotton took two wickets for 78, and G. H. Hearns
three wickets for 51. At the end of the first day’s play
six of the Kent wickets had fallen for 84, but next day
the remaining batsmen brought the score up to 222
Tylsoote, not out, 100, Wilson, 57; Patterson, 19; and
Lord Harris, 17, being the principal scorers. Being 85
behind, they had to follow on, when they succeeded in
totalling 165—Patterson, 59; Wilson, 50; and Lord
Harris, 24, being the principal scorers. Tylecete was
bowled fer four. The Australians secured the 81 rune re-
quired with the loss of three wickets. Massie, 42;
Bannerman, 19; M'Donnell, 2; Murdoch, 14; and
Hsran, 1; were the not-ont men. In Kent’s first in-
nings Palmer got three wickets for 70 runs, and Gar-
rett six wickets for 62 runs. In the second .innings,
Garrett got six wickets for 58 runs, and Palmer four
wickets fer 44 runs.
A large attendance of spectators assembled on
the Association Ground, on Satnrday, to witness the
Intercolonial Football Match, under Eugby rules,
between the Brisbane players and a combined team of
Sydney. Although the Brisbane men played a good
and fast game throughout, it was apparent from the
very first that they were much overmatched. Play waa
kept close to tbs Brisbane goal nearly all the time, and
whilst onr men distinguished themselves by their passing
and following in an eminent degree, these important
qualities were conspicuous by their absenoo in the
Brisbane play. There was also a deal of off-side play,
which would not hare been permitted in a club match,
bat the umpire, Mr. Arnold, exercised a wise discretion
by not restricting the Brisbane men toe muoh to rules
with which they were obviously imperfootlylacqnainted.
It was noticeable that towards the finish the Brisbane
players, profiting by their experience of the Sydney
play, improved very much. Owing to this, they were
enabled to score a goal obtained by Fees, who was
passed the ball from a scrimmage, and made a splendid
run, dodging his opponents, and, by a splendid drop-
kick, scored the only goal to the credit of Brisbane.
His dashing feat waa performed amidst tumultuous
applause from the spectators. Fer the Sydney men,
Walker, Baper, Bennett, and Flynn did yeoman service.
The Sydney men secured four goals, flve-tonoh-downs
to Brisbane’s one goal. There were no serious acci-
dents ; one of the Brisbane players had to be assisted
to the pavilion at the end of the play, and another hnrt
his knee-cap—that’s all.,
The Australians have at length suffered a
second defeat in England. And this time we must con-
fess that our team has been defeated on its merits.
Looking at the results of other matches, the Cambridge
victory might be considered as one of those untoward
event) which may happen at any time in the uncertain-
ties of cricket. Bnt the Flayers of England are looked
upon as a partly representative team, and certainly as,
far and away, the bast men our boys have yet met at
home. The team pitted against them consisted of the
following cracks:—Barnes, Bates, Emmett, Flowers,
Lockwood, Morley, Peate, Shrewsbury, Ulyett. Bead,
and Sherwin. Spo (forth was unwell, and had, with
Jones, to bo left out of.the Australian team. The loss
of our crack bowler may have had muoh to do with the
big score the Players made. The Australian fielding
was weak and the bowling wav knocked about, the
Players totalling 322 runs—Bead 130, Barne* 87, Flowers
25, Emmett 21, Ulyett 12, and Sherwin 10, being the
priaoipal scorers. Palmer took three wiekete for 99,
Banmsrmaa two for 20, Garrett three for 106, Boyle one
for 86. The English bowling and fielding were superb.
The first men, Massie and Bannerman. retired for ail,
and the score amounted to 150—Horan 47, Murdoch 35,
Blaekham 17, M Donnell 12, Giffen 12, Bonnor 9, Palmer
(not o«t) 3, Boyle 1, Massie, Bannerman, and Garrett 0,
sundries 14. Following on, they were disposed of for
138—Massie 31, Giffen 23, M’Donnell 18, Murdoch 15,
Garrett (net out) 15, Bannerman 14, Bonnor 8, Horan
3, Blaokham 1, Boyle and Palmer 0, sundries 10. In
the first innings, Morley took four wickets for 39, and
in the second three for 31. The weather was line, and
the attendance on the Bennington Oval during the
three days was enormous.

A four-handed game of billiards was played at one of
the principal rooms last week with rather remarkable
results in the closeness of the play. The scores were

up to P 9, and then, at his third shot, he failed to score,
leaving the balls close together behind the baulk-line.
His opponent then made a canon, potted the white,
and in the next stroke gently hit the red, leaving both
balls in baulk. The next player went up and down the
table, but failed to hit either ball, thus giving a miss
and the game to his opponents. The players were a
well-known professional basso and au organist, against
an amateur tenor and a son of a lately deceased

off on 19th June at Windsor (Bng.j, between Mr. Page t

match were thus :—The competitors were to start from
the Victoria Barracks, and run through the town to
the water side, cross the Thames as they could, and
then take a beat aad row over the Etonian course, fre m
Windsor bridge to the Bushel, and back (about
three miles); and then run over the Winds* »•
bridge to the barracks, the running distance,
being about a mile. Mr. Paget was the first at thq
water-aide, and was ferried across, and ha got away in
a wkif gig before Colonel Milner h*,d landed. Colonel
Milner followed in a racing entrigger, Mr. Pag. t
having a good start of two hundred yards. Colonel

There was an air of romance about the marriage
of Sir Daniel Cooper’s daughter with Mr. Trevau-
ion, son of Mr. and Lady Trevanion. The bridegroom,
i inpatient at the obstacles pat in the way of the mar-
riage, took the law in his own hands, and ao had the
ceremony quietly performed, without anyone’s know-
ledge.

Now ia the time of year in the Burnett (Q.) capi-
tal, when baltw-and races predominate. Private and se-
lect parties meet on these festive occasions. Civil ser-
vants out the storekeeper .whom they cannot pay for
the clothes they wear, and give tesherche evenings at
home on accommodation notes. The bachelors, too,
give a magnificent ball, on the liberal principle of mak-
ing everyone pay a guinea who attends, aud the hungry
supers" crowd iu from the back blocks, and make a
fuiious onslaught on the publicans' fare. At the ball
they use language which, though stamping them of
high lineage, would bo blackguardism in leas distingue
personages. They have also a playful way of shying
pickle and porter bottles at one another, and, when
morning breaks, Aurora reveals them iu a state of san-
gu nary drunk. There is no town in Queensland pro-
greasing so fast as Baudaberg. All that it wants now

On July 23, the Loyal Western Star Lodge of
Oddfellows hisld their annual ball, in the Mechanic-’
Institute, Coonamblo. It had been twico postponed,
bat was, after all, one of the most brilliant affairs
that ever shed “a luminosity” over the interior of this
continent. In fact, now that the Parramatta Hole of
Arts has been seized by an inexorable (but still pure)
Government, there is never likely to be any other ntfiir
ia the annals of the colony to equal it. Emblems of the
order and evergreens decked the hall, rich attires w-ire
men on the ladies, the kerosene lamps had been care-
fully cleaned, and the gentlemen had all removed the
iron heels from their boots in order to get cn square
terms with the dances, and have a fair start. Mr. Rut-
land and Mr. George King played well-timed music on
the piano and concertina, and thirty brethren wore
their regalia. A procession, headed by the Noble
Grand, coon-ambled ronnd the room, and the orchestra
of two put high pressure on their instruments to give
the thing tone. Married ladies again took the lead
in gorgeoasness of dross, and such magnificence was
shown, regardless of outlay, that the leading families
have since done all their washing at heme. To a slight
young lady lof the married persuasion, in white satin,
trimmed with gold honeycombed satin, lace, flowers,
sprays and pearls, was accorded the title of honour.
A matron looked wall in a skirt of black silk velvet and
cream satin, cream and old-gold bodice ; and a young
lady, arfmired for her graceful dancing and exquisite
bust, in black satin and cerise, was observed to nave a
groat tendency to steel buttons—also to steal hearts,
and other uicnacs. A popular lady, ia black silk and
cardinal, took the palm for dancing; while another
Ldyin blue* silk, pink and flowers, could “ rub the
whiting off" any ordinary girl quite easily, with
chirms to spare. At midnight the guaats looted the
snpoer tables, and, after clearing off all the turkey,
tr.fls, and “ shivering jimmy,” returned to raise dust
and splinters with renewed ardour. Alcohol was
absent. Roger da Coverlay closed the ball at 5 o’elook.
The carpenters are now busy fixing up the gashes in

The first of the Aibury assemblies eventuated
last Friday week, ia the Mechanics’lnstitute. Owing
to the inclemency of the weather, there was an
i.(sufficiency of ladies; consequently, those present
wero above par. But they bore iheir advantage meekly.
P.nin and fancy. Two gallmts from Qermanton side
(ippsared ns Australian Youths, and boro themselves in
that gay aud jovial manner peculiarly their own. The
junior partner in the leading Aibury Commission
Agency posed as King William the Conqueror, but his
triumphs were of another sort, A young Albnry
solicitor took the suggestive character of a Fowler.
The local banks contributed the sine qua non, in the
shape of a dozen bachelors. And now the ladies—who,
iu imitation of a precedent in Canaan, are reserved for
the last. A tall, loretty blonde, in the character of
Venus appearing as a huntress to rEiieas, was very much
adinired„and, fair archer, she bent her beau quite deftly.
Another amiable young lady appeared as Lot’s Wife
after the “ transformation scene,’’ but she was infinitely
more sweat. A very fair and very young lady in cream,
tiughtthe meaning of the Emerald simile —like a straw
berry smothered in cream,” and made one’s mouth water.
The Commercial Bank sent the beet treasure it con-
tained in the always charming person of a married lady,
in black silk with steel laoe trimmings and cardinal
11 iwera. Prom the Customs came .a pretty figure in
blue silk, with maize trimmings of the same materia),
and lace. She was an exponent of “ the poetry of
motion.” Another very young lady (it pains us to
picture all the conquests of these demoiselles vivantes)
tripped fawu-like in blue silk, trimmed with white lace
and silver flowers. Two sisters, as Daphne but, let’s
cease, that means painting .the lily. Prom Wodonga,
also, came good costumes, and still better dancers.
Till morning they danced, aud now don’t know whether
to look with most satisfaction back on the last assembly
or forward to the next one.

The first of a aeries of private quadrille assem-
blies was held iu the Town Hall, Liverpool, on Wed-
nesday evening last week, and was a decided success.
The music was good, the guests were numerous, and
nicely dressed. A young lady from Granville was
charming in black velvet, trimmed with cardinal bows,
white lace and flowers ; two sisters in black attracted
mud attention. A fair maiden was captivating in dark
moire with gold and white Honiton lace Other dresses
wero tasteful, but too numerous to particularize. Danc-
ing was continued from 8 until 12, and all went home

At Pitt-atreet Church, last Thuraday, the Rev.
J. Jtfferis united two of his regular attenaants, Mias
Emily, eldest daughter of Mr. James Brierly, of
“Soudan,” and Mr. J. B. Watson. Flowered arches in
the aisle, and friendly faces all round the gallery. Mr.
Kent, M.A , presided at the organ. The bride was
lauuifuily dressed in cream satin, with trimming of
cr mm moire, lace, and orange blossoms. Misses Edith,
Louie, Fiorrio and Eva, younger editions, and Miss
Addie, who was of course an addie-tion, were all sisters
ot the bride, and helped as her maids. Taey wore
reqidctively, pink, blue, and cream nuu’s-veiling, each
trimmed with plush to match, &c. Mr. H. Gillam was
be.t man. Mrs. Brierly Wore rich green surah satin,
with shaded trimmings; Mrs. Robertson claret with
silk and plush; Mrs. Alderman Hardie, brown moire
aud silk. After the ceremony, a sumptuous repast waa
attacked at “Soudan,” the company clearing with
vigour, na ft guest said, “ Wats-on the table.” Mr.
Jetfaria felicitously proposedjthe;haalth of the happy
couple, aud other toasts ware given which we forget,
aud one which we’d like to, but can’t forget, because it
was about municipal affairs. Dancing and Binging
followed. Honeymoon at Blackheath.

The first Tradesmen’s Ball was held in New-
castle, at the City Hall, on the 9th August, Both plain
and fancy dress wars worn, and so tar as appearance and
attendance went, it was a fluacers. Also f>r conviviality,
It oodld not bo regarded as dull; hut the spread was
inferior, in fact, a failure. Dancing began at nine, and
lasted till late on Thursday morning, and never was it
kept up more spiritedly in the coal city. Same eighty
couples were present, and many costumes were both
expensive and handsome. Among those deserving of
special mention ware thefollowing Mrs. H. Alderton,
as vendor of fl iwers; Mias Burns, as Mabel (in “The
Pirates”); Mrs. Thomas Corrigan as Isabella of
Castille; the wife of the senior membir for Newcastle,
Mrs. James Fletcher, whq wore a magnificent cardinal
and brocaded satin, trimmed with black velvet and jet;
Mrs. J. Fletcher, jun., as Fern Girl; Miss Lily Farth-
ing, Polish Lady; and Mias Flynn, as a Lombardy
Peasant Girl. The dress of the evening, however, was
worn by the wife of Mr. J, Miller Sweet, of the New-
castle Morning Herald. This lady represented the
Press, and her dress was original and handsome. It
was composed of lovely white satin, on which
were printed several pages of the paper above
mentioned, each column being ia a distinct
colour, and every paragraph could be as easily read as
if on paper. On one side was a local scene, “ Shipping
coal in Newcastle," and on the other, “ Success to the
Tradesmen’s Bill,** in the centre of which were the
various flags of the Australian colonies—-each being in
a separate colour. The sleeves and other portions had
blocks representing various professions, etc., and all
were most beautifully blended together. The head-dress
was that of "Minerva,” the goddess of wisdom, and
looked lovely. It was also printed on satin, with a
hand, bearing the words “ The Press," surmounting
the forehead The dress was printed at the Herald
and Advertiser office, by the “ Gardiner " parti-colour
process (in one working), and richly deserved all the
encomia passed upon it and the fair wearer at the
ball. The costumes of the gentlemen were most dazzl-
ing, as a rale, though a few were fairly fanciful. Mr.
D. Dobie was Horatio; R. L. Levy, Touchstone; F.
Lockhead, Earl of Essex; Q. Ross, Mephiitopheles; J.
D Swanson, a Gvribaldian ; J M. Sweet, an English
Officer; Joseph Wood, Don Ceeiar de Bazin; and A.
Watt, Spanish Chevalier Mr. Colin Christie provided
music, and Mr. Hartnell, the seoreta -y. has since
handed over £26 to the hospital. Altogether, the
tradesmen had a floe ball, and the only sad retro-
spent is. it is whispered, that the local thnnderer didn’t
boom the ladies as the dear creatures deserved.

The second of the Narrabri winter dances
came off on Wednesday week, and, though not nn.
merously attended, the orime di la crime of district
society was there. Some of the ladies were neatly and
tastefully dressed, and others had evidently used their
utmost endeavours to make themselves beautiful for
ever. Tne supper and refreshments were of a more
solid nature than at the last ball, and there was plants
of coffee. Tae legal element was again to the fore in
every department, especially at the music and sapper
table. At these assemblies the aristocracy mix with
ordinary human beings quite freely. Big squatters
descend to bow to law, trade, and, in f»ct, to all
that make up society other than squatter. Tnose who
know, as every one should, that this country was
specially designed and created by Divine Beneficence
for squatters, will be thankful for this genial con-
descension. The late secretary to the dances was
obliged to resign because he spent 2s 91. without the
sanction of the committee : the most flagrant conduct
we have heard of since Davies bought those top hats.
But under the new regime this dance cost 10s., which is
a rather serious matter, and may lead to trouble. Some
of the claw-hammers looked terribly tight; that
might have beau the tailor’s [fault. Yet, by a curious
coincidence, many gentlemen who were at the previons
dance wero not at this; while many at this were not
at the previous one. Possibly, that might explain the
tightness of the claw-hammers. Among the ladies
there was a decided preference for white, suggestive
more of a confirmation service than what dear Father
Henneberry calls “ a device of the devil." We feel we
have scarcely done the ladies) justice, but, for the next
occasion, nous venom .

pended under the chandelier, aud, the gentleman being

will be privileged to express their gratitude.

“ Lynwood,” Glebe Point, was the scene of a
very pretty drawing-room wedding, last Thursday. The
bride was the eldest daughter of Mr. R. Fitz-Stubbs
and was tastefully attired in cream corded silk, richly
trimmed with Spanish laoaef same oolour. Tulle veil,
embroidered with white filoselle and wreath of orange
blossoms. The bridegroom was Mr. Eiklngton of
Balmain. The bridesmaids numbered six, and were all
members of the family—throe in French white and
1 hrea in pink. The wedding presents were unusually
handsome. In the evening of the same day Mrs. Fitz-
Stubbs gave one of her delightful parties in honour of
the occasion. The house and grounds wore prettily
and handsomely decorated.; the provision made for the
creature comforts of the guests being prepared
in tbo best and newest style. The music was
particularly good. At eleven o’clock the ballroom
presented a lively spectacle, all the dresses being rich
and elegant. The charming hostess was attired in rich
black satin-de-lyon, trimmed with flounces of real white
laoe, train of figured velvet, headdress of lace and
marabout feathers, the whole costume being pronounced
most striking and appropriate. A married daughter of
the house, of whom a bank manager up North is the
very fortunate possessor, was dressed in pale heliotrope
and white laoe, the oolour and style suiting much the
golden hair and fair skin of that youthful matron.
Mrs. H. R, Woods, in cream and cerise, looked remark-
ably well. In white nun’s veiling and satin hroobe,
two elder unmarried daughters of the house appeared
to advantage ; in fact, by many, one was considered
the belle of the ball; but amongst so many lovely faces
it would be a hard matter to decide. A young lady
from “Fairligkt," Manly, was particularly admired
for her graceful dancing. Mrs. Walter German, from
Woo lahra, in white corded silk, with plush body and
deep red roses, looked more than usually well. A
daughter of a Tamworth squatter, iu pale lavender
silk and pansy wreath, attracted attention. Mrs.
W. Broomfield, in pale Ipink, with satin to
match,, and another lady iu cream silk aud. cardinal
satin, "were noticeable amongst the guests, who
numbered over sixty. Only three blue dresses—
one, a pale llama with forget-me-nots ; another, a
sateen, riehly worked iu erewels, with Madras muslin
over-siirt and a wreath of small sunflowers ; the third,
a beautiful pale silk, worn by Signora Giorza, who
lookud charming. Not many would look so well as did
n young lady iu a simple white dress cut low to the
shomders with short sleeves. In this case, the arms
aud shoulders were exceptionally pretty. A young lady
from a red town in Queensland loosed pensive in cream
aud cardinal.

For some years past the employees of Victoria
House have had, among themselves aud friends, an
annual reunion, and the event of this year, in the shape
of a ball, took place at Nithsdale last Friday. It was 9
o’clock ere dancing oommcncfc’d.. The young men
were a'l ready half an-hour earlier; Kad usefully
employed the interval by stroking their gl«ve-*ogers
into superfine smoothness, hitching up thfllf Imma-
culate collars, and shedding sly glances of satisfaction
on their shining pumps ana lovely red aoeks. A man
is scarcely tt man, new, if he doesn’t wear red eo:ks
At last, however Farmer and Co.’s young ladies
tripped down. Now, aS to wh» w,s tfie'e, and what
was done The music was milch approved. Prom
Croajingalong, theta was a gentleman called by some
Squire Pye, but wrongl®. His proper name Is Fruit
Pye. Several small dots of girls were nOtlcsd,
and so were several small boys, at the sunper.
Among the ladies were two sisters from Stan-
more, and a pair from Pyrmont; while two
small girls nicely dresssed, and wearing hyacinths
chiefly adorned the centre of the room. On a little
chair In a quiet corner was established another little
chere, such a pretty blonde in satin plush and chen-
ille, all white—Miss Barber. Good dresses were those
of Miss Morey, of white satin and gold etcetera* j Mrs.
Carroll, cardinal satin; and a fair lady who wore thu
new ficelle—coloured satin, like a peculiar shade of
fawn. A Glebe lady displayed a brocaded silk of pretty
chocolate hue. trimmed with white lace. A very grace-
ful girl was Miss Jonkina, which is not a supremely
desirable name. we imagined
the young lady would have been called Georgians de
Pitzmontol it, or Agonisa Blueheathor, or something in
that style, and it made us rather sorry to hear— Jen-
kins. Miss Evans wore all white satin and laoe, a dress
of striking tastefulness, and attractive also was M>ss
Pisher, in blue cashmere edged in swanadown. The
belle of the ball in every respect was unquestionably
Mies King, a tall and remarkably handsome brunette,
costumed in ivory cashmere and satin, with roses in
her hair. The heads of the firm were prevented by
other engagements from attending the festivity, but
expreaso-i their good wishes. The fun was prolonged till
well on in the morning, and all agreed that annual
gatherings of the sort are not only agreeable at the
time, bat serve to extend mutual acquaintances and
good feeling among those who j >in in ahem, especially
