The people who had the good sense—and the artistic sense—to put White
Malthoid Roofs on their homes felt the benefit during the last hot spell.
White Malthoid has a skin or coating of Asbestos, and you know that Asbestos
is not affected by either heat or cold. A home with a White Malthoid Roof
is not only a handsome home, but a comfortable one. May we send you

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and
find themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and _ their antiseptic properties
prevent abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive
ferments to act, and if taken regularly
after meals they so improve the diges-
tion that a strict diet becomes unneces-
sary. Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes
are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dys-
pepsia.

C.HUDSON:
The Red Page
2d.
The death of Captain Scott and his Com-
panions thrilled the world; the story of that
fated expedition sent a pulse of pity round
the globe; and British hearts were proud
that the old race could produce so heroic
a manifestation of its traditional ideals. In
that dull old world of peace heroism still
lived. The chances for its display were
few; and often, as in this expedition, they
had to be deliberately sought for; yet when
the few opportunities were seized, how
nobly and how heroically men could die!
Men were still men: the old standards still
stood untarnished. Here was a needed
revelation that even in times of peace there
were hearts heroic, possibly foolishly heroic.
The great peaceful world, fattening slowly in
its pig-pen, felt the better for this vicarious
sacrifice. It applauded, sorrowed over the
death of such fine men, wondered a little
dully whether such exploits were worth
while, and then turned, with a better appe-
tite, to its dinner in the trough.
And now! Since August the world has
made a marvellous discovery. Heroism is
not the jealous perquisite of a few daring,
adventurous spirits. It is much more
widely distributed than we had imagined.
A million unknown soldiers have taken the
same risks with the same cheerful reckless-
ness,'have gone to their death with the same
gallant self-sacrifice, have proved the value
of a mere ideal with the same desperate
courage. Thousands of Captain Scotts
have fought with the same glorious tenacity
a losing fight with fate ; thousands of Cap-
tain Oates’ have deliberately dedicated
themselves to death in order to save the lives
of their comrades in the trenches. Hero-
ism? It is cheap. Life? It is worth tup-
pence. What soldier at the front would
weigh it in the balance with such tremen-
dously valuable things as the gaining of a
few yards of trenches, the capture of a
machine-gun, the destruction of some feet
of barbed wire entanglements? Captain
Oates was a noble figure staggering away
to death in the Antarctic blizzard. Private
Smith is just as noble a figure, charging to
certain death into a shrapnel blizzard.
Heroism has become almost a common-
place. Yet it is still heroism —-as was the
heroism of Captain Scott, The war has
merely given the world a chance to show
the fibre of a man —and one of the strands
of that fibre is an almost superhuman
courage. An immense discovery.
And, having discovered this noble fact,
humanity—the humanity that stays, like
you and me, at home- —gradually ceases to
feel the old thrill. The world is surfeited
with heroism. The soul of man cannot
react with the same intensity to repeated
shocks; it takes glory, self-sacrifice, daunt-
less daring—so common have they, happily,
become —as a commonplace. It can still
thrill; but it can’t go on thrilling indefi-
nitely.
J*
So human life, that in the old days had
a value that we now recognise as excessive,
has now reached its true worth —somewhere
in the neighborhood of tuppence. Human
life is the only commodity that since the
war has not increased in price. During
long years of peace the price of life had
been gradually inflated, until the death of a
few men, even men of the calibre of Cap-
tain Scott and his companions, was re-
garded by humanity as a tremendous loss.
Now not one day passes without the destruc-
tion of hundreds of lives just as noble, just
as valuable. And three of these lives are
worth about sixpence. The owners of these
lives recognise their value: they fling them
away with a careless recklessness that is
glorious; for to each one of us our own life
is worth considerably more than its fighting
value.
Reading history, one often had the
thought, “These old civilisations did not
seem to value human life at all.” Even to-
day there are huge civilisations, like that of
China, that seem to put no value at all on
the lives of their own subjects. One’s
astonishment at this low evaluation of so
precious a thing was simply due to a gene-
ration of peace. The low value of human
life is the normal value, the value it has
always had, except in the last generation
or so. Now the war has burst up the in-
flated values, and back the commodity goes
to 2d.
So it is that in reading The Home of the
Blizzardl, the story of the Australasian
Antarctic Expedition, 1911-1914, by Doug-
las Mawson (two lordly volumes, 365. in
England, published by Heinemann), one
fails to thrill over the exploits, sympathise
with the sufferings, and sorrow over the
deaths of Ninnis and Mertz as one would
have thrilled and sympathised and sorrowed
before August last. The hardships of these
men were nothing to the hardships of the
trenches in Flanders; the risks they took
are being taken every hour, and as part of
the day’s work, by every private in the
advanced lines; and the deaths of Ninnis
and Mertz were merciful compared to the
deaths of thousands of soldiers who are dying
at this instant. Not that the members of this
expedition were not brave; not that they
did not suffer hardship and death; but we
—who stay at home —are sated with
bravery, and hardship and death have be-
come commonplaces of this world of war:
we, who stay at home —you and I —are
sated with heroism. Before last August we
had time for those who go forth to seek
adventures for the sake of knowledge. The
loss of the Titanic shook the world with
horror: the loss of a British or German
cruiser has become merely a matter of re-
gret or of joy. Antarctic exploration seems
now like playing a game on the battlefield:
there is work of too grave importance ahead.
We have done with sport, even sport for the
sake of knowledge.
Thus, all that one feels inclined to say of
The Home of the Blizzard is that it iis
beautifully produced, that the photographs
by Hurley are the finest photographs yet
taken in polar regions, that the mere list of
illustrations fills many pages in the index,
that the color photographic plates furnish
the first authentic glimpse of the virgin
color of these regions, that the various nar-
ratives are vividly and succinctly written;
that Mawson’s own account of the death of
his companions and his terrible lonely
struggle back to the main base is of absorb-
ing interest, that the glimpses afforded of
life in these terrible surroundings are human
and picturesque, and that the book of our
own Antarctica has a clamant interest for
Australasians. Mawson has inscribed Aus-
tralia’s name on its far-south front door;
but 80,000 Mawsons are building a monu-
ment more enduring than brass —a monu-
ment of mere human lives —upon the
glorious muddy battlefields of Europe.
What is a german?
Too many competitors in their answers to
this question have mistaken abuse for a
definition. “E.B.’s” complaint that this
page inaugurated a “name-calling” competi-
tion is to that extent justified; but the in-
tention of this page was surely clear : what
was wanted, what was definitely asked for,
was a definition. And, considering the
great number of entries, the result was not
brilliant. Many of the competitors wrote
essays rather than made definitions. Thus,
one competitor defined a german as a Cad—
and took half a dozen pages to explain what
he meant by caddism. Another started off
with : “A german is a colossal composite of
genius leavened with brutality,” and failed
to leave it at that.
“Maroka” supplies tragedy :—■
A german?
’Tis he whose horrific name made the dumb suckling
infant flinch,
And flinching clench his teething gums upon that
sacred font, his dying mother’s breast.
A german ?
’Tis he who made the gentle mother pale .'with fear
Weep with alarm and endure the silent agony of the
fearfully defiled.
A german?
O God ! The heroic shot-torn father in the trenches,
seeking with muddied hand to stem the crimson
flood, sobbed once again that fierce horrific name,
A german!
And F. Oldman lightens the subject by a
little necessary irony :
Until the beginning of the war, being an un-
travelled person, my mind picture of a typical ger-
man was a spectacled, beer-drinking, barrel-shaped
trumpet blower, with a benign' expression and an
unpronounceable name existing on Sauerkraut and
Port Fritz and attached by the mouth to a huge
tobacco distiller when not engaged in his above-
mentioned trumpet-blowing industry.
Since William of the Withered Arm set out to
conquer the world, I have read the newspapers dili-
gently, studying sketches; and wading through some
of the leading articles, and have made the following
discovery:—
A german is a blood-thirsty, , plundering,
moustachioed retreater, accustomed to addressing
Jehovah familiarly and everlastingly in unreadable
broken English, and whose dreams are made'horrible
by visions of Kitchener. A swashbuckling miscreant,
because of whom Russian, French and all foreign
names are regarded with grave suspicion by the
unlettered but Patriotic Britisher.
This abandoned cause of the patriotic poem (being
massacred daily in his hundreds of thousands by the
press) must now be almost extinct, and at the pre-
sent rate of slaughter should trouble the world but
a few weeks longer. To conclude: my Aunt asked
me to say that she thinks all germans are abominable
wretches, and why doesn’t somebody kill the Kaiser
and stop the war?
A number of competitors despaired of a
definition. “Also Ran” ends his too-long
screed:—
Arrogance, treachery, cruelty, lust,
Murder and arson and sullen mistrust;
All these, personified, is he. So why
Ask to define him? Useless to try.
What is a german? Answer comes, pat:
A german’s a german! Leave it at that.
S. A. Perry remarks: “A german is a ger-
man —that’s all. There’s nothing else like
it, so no definition is possible, as a definition
always contains some element of compari-
son.” “Jimdick” finds it necessary to become
futuristic:—
1 man -]- militarism -j- brutality + (patriotism -
humanity) iron crosses one kaiser + (ambition
- honor) + many blunders (which are) X (his) Celes-
tial Ally = the german military caste.
“Von Gutz,” however, relapses into pure
Anstralese:—
In brief and with all reverence for the convention-
alities, The german is A “COW.” A dirty “COW.”
A dirty “COW.” The dirtiest of all
“COWS.”
B.J. suggests that the “man” part of the
word german should be cut out. What’s left
after that didn’t matter.
Some miscellaneous samples:-

ness of. destroying civilisation. It was last practised

until recently was mistaken for a dachshund.

the Scourge of the Saus-Ages.

The Peter Pan of Europe—the boy who wouldn’t

One who cultivates Literature upon a little salt-
petre.
But, after all, none of these definitions
really define. For the german is beyond
definition. The prize is awarded, in despera-
tion, to James Dalton, Auteuil, Loftus-street,
Claremont, W.A., for his typically exasper-
ated Australian viewpoint:—
“A german is—a german. Blast him!”
The Voyages of Captain Scott (Bell; 3s.
6d.), retold from Scott’s Last Expedition
and his previous book, by Charles Turley,
with an undistinguished preface by J, M.
Barrie, and some of the original illustra-
tions, makes an acceptable boy’s adventure
book.
The war has not taken all England’s spare
cash. The Medici Society, which specialises
in luxurious books, chose this Christmas to
put out a new Alice in Wonderland, with
the same old Tenniel pictures, but beauti-
fully got up at 155., lowest price, with better
binding at a guinea, and a luxury edition at
12 guineas! But then it charges £l5 15s.
for The Book of Genesis —with 10 illustra-
tions—and the copyright of this novel has
expired.
The indefatigable Arthur Wright obliges
sporting readers with another of his Book-
stall shilling novels, A Sport from Hollow
Log Flat, quite up to sample,
One of the biggest short-story contests ever
held has just been brought to a conclusion
in Uncle Samland. Collier’s Weekly
(New York) conducted it, and the first
announcement in connection with it was
made in April, 1913. It was open to the
world; stories had to be between, 1000 and
12,000 words, and the contest closed on Sep-
tember 1, 1913. The first prize was £500;
the second £2OO, and there were eight added
prizes of £lOO each. These sums were paid
in addition to Colliek’s usual rate of five
cents a word for the copyright of the stories.
So the contest was a valuable one. Stories
had to be submitted anonymously. The
judges were Theodore Roosevelt, Ida M. Tar-
bell and Mark Sullivan, editor of Collieb’s.
Over 8000 stories were submitted from all
parts of the world in this contest, and the
sorting and reading of them took several
months, the result not being announced until
October 3 last. The first prize went to
James B. Connolly, the well-known Yankee
author who is at present in England as
special naval correspondent for Collier’s.
His story, ‘‘The Trawler,” was a fine piece of
work dealing with the sea, and was placed
first by two of the judges and third by the
other. The second prize went to a writer
with the wonderful name of Ceylon Hollings-
worth for a story entitled “Saleratus
Smith,” dealing with a revivalist. The other
eight prizes went mostly to unknown
writers, and Collier’s generously threw in
four added prizes of £lOO each to the authors
of four other stories that had been favor-
ably commented upon by the judges. So
altogether the big New York weekly squan-
dered #9500 in prizes. It is interesting to
note that in prize money and payment for
the copyright of his story James B. Connolly
lifted £620 for “The Trawler.” Collier’s,
however, says it doesn’t regret the deal for it
considers it has got value for the cash.
Collier’s offered the big money with the
idea of unearthing “real gold,” and it looks
as if it has succeeded.
The second annual issue of Norman Lind-
say’s Book (N.S.W. Bookstall, Is.) is as
brilliant and original as its cover. The ver-
satility of Lindsay’s genius is obvious in
this collection of his work. He supplies
striking war cartoons, inimitable pages of
animal humor, brilliant illustrations to the
interesting letterpress, masterful ship-draw-
ings, and riotous humor-—and throws in, out
of sheer exuberance, a charming assortment
of Norman Lindsay Girl, whom we are sur-
prised and cheered to see existed in the
Valley of Elah, 1101 B.c. Her name was
Luta—that eminent antiquarian and Hebrew
authority, Montague Grover, is responsible
for these particulars-—and she wore little
more than her modern descendant in Sydney
does during the heat-wave. Luta herself,
even without her clothes, is worth more than
the shilling charged for the whole volume.
The contributors include, beside the eminent
Hebraist afore-mentioned, author of “Judah
and the Giant,” Lawson, C. J. Dennis, Louis
Stone, Edward Dyson and Charles P. Smith.
Chinese Lyrics
WILD GEE§E.
Hotv oft against the sunset sky or moon
I watched that moving zigzag of spread
wings
In unforgotten autumns gone too soon,
In unforgotten springs!
Creatures of desolation, far they fly
Above all lands bound by the curling foam;
In misty fens, wild moors and trackless sky
These wild things have their home.
They lcnoio the tundra of Siberian coasts,
And tropic marshes by the Indian seas;
They know the clouds and night and starry
hosts
From Crux to Pleiades. . / ,
Bark flying rune against the western glow —
It tells of the sweep and loneliness of
things,
Symbol of autumns vanished long ago,
Symbol of coming springs! ‘
Pai Ta-Shun.
ABSENCE.
The Spring seems distant with her jasmine-
flowers.
The gaunt, bare trees with icicles are
drest,
The snowbird in the cryptomeria coivcrs;
Yet —is Spring far when Spring is in my
breast?
And you seem far, too far for eye to see
Your lantern and your lattices apart —
So many moons, so many hundred li
Yet —are you far when you are in my
heart?

Self-Loading Shotgun, 12 Gauge
The Winchester Model 1911 Self-Loader is a wild-fowl gun par excellence. The
recoil ejects the fired shell, feeds a loaded shell from the magazine into the
chamber, cocks the hammer and leaves the gun ready to be fired again. In wild-
fowl shooting, the game often comes fast and when least expected. Shoot a
Winchester Self-Loader and you can always be prepared for a series of shots; for
the loading and firing of this gun are controlled by the trigger finger. As the re-
coil of this gun is used to operate the reloading mechanism, the “kick” of heavy
loads is minimized, making the gun very pleasant to shoot. It is a hammerless,
two-part, take-down, five-shot repeater, that works well with all standard loads.
The working parts being made of Nickel steel, make it strong and safe.
Ask your dealer to show you the Winchester that’s
LOADED BY RECOIL, CONTROLLED BY THE FINGER TRIGGER.

HERE are five reasons why you
should have a bicycle built of
Genuine B.S.A. Fittings in preference
to a cheap ‘pattern’ machine: —
1. You get far better value.
2. You get greater reliability.
3. You get an easier running machine.
4. You get economy in upkeep.
5. You get a much higher price for the
bicycle when you want to sell it.

The Riddle.
I am as one who wanders in a deep
And pathless wood, and feels through all the
place
Beatings of unseen wings, and on his face
Soft breaths like a caress. And, as in sleep,
Through his enchanted brain strange visions
creep
Of sorrowful dead lovers, whose high race
Died long ago. Nor can their import trace
Clearly, nor why he cannot choose but weep.
O Life, Life, Life! who knows what the
wood’s heart
May hold for him who follows unafraid
Whither thy spell may lead him? What
strange flowers
Bloom in the silence of thine inmost hours.
What secret spring murmurs its song apart?
What horn of faery wakes the hushed and
moonlit glade?
N.S.W.
FRITZ S. BURNELL.
An Idyll of Unemployment.
The simple rose had lifted up its head
In laughter to the sun ;
The populace on bread and dripping fed
.Sighed for the day begun,
And those who bought a morning paper knew
as much as the keen censor would let
through.
They read with what tremendous loss of life
We stayed the foes’ advance.
They scanned with joy the map that showed
where strife
Was loud and red in France,
And where embattled Russia, rank on rank,
t’ressed her hot spears upon the Austrian
flank.
It was a day to count my ready cash
And sadly spurn delight.
A single beerward step were all too rash
For one in my sore plight;
But Letty passed, and on her small, round
chin,
I saw the dimple that her smile drew in.
The sun had brought the snakes abroad to
view
The happy slopes of fern,
Where one tall tree a happy shadow threw
Our grateful thanks to earn.
But not one serpent of the crawling throng
Lifted a fang to do us scaithe or wrong.
The pleasant girl had roses in her hat
And both her eyes were kind,
As on the rustic simple ground we sat
With nothing to remind
Our bright twin souls that we were not as
free
As the young birds that twittered on the
tree.
Love is not quite as blind as some aver.
Her neck was soft as milk,
Her darkening hair was braided over her
Like perfumed silk ;
I saw her plainly, and I know that she
Was greatly taken with the look of me.
I ceased to be aware as there we stayed,
My arm around her waist,
Of various things that made my soul afraid
And she in the warm taste
Of my delightful lips put care aside,
And wore her well-darned stockings like a
bride.
The German might be full of pride and take
An extra size in guns.
It might be hard the serried ranks to break
Of creditors and duns.
Letty might sigh for her departed job,
And I for the sad right to earn a bob,
But there beneath the branches of a tree,
That greenly cast their shade,
We were as happy as two souls could be —•
A man and dimpled maid,
Who felt exactly like young gods who sat
With their pink toes on Ossa’s mossy mat.
We stayed a long time in that quiet place,
Then gently strolled away
To where, upon the harbor’s sandstone face,
The small, pink houses lay.
And there continued our delightful dream
And hallowed young affection with ice cream.
At last we parted sweetly at a gate,
With blissful kisses twain.
’Twas eventide. - We could no longer wait.
Far over stark Balmain
The dying sun was throwing, amber light,
And making garret windows jewel bright.
Next day I wandered through the weary
town,
One of the unemployed,
Guarding with care one lonely, last half-
crown —
My simple heart upbuoyed
By all the happy memories it bore,
Of sunshine, kisses and the day before.
My Letty would be dreaming now of me.
At the warm evening’s close.
Her busy hands prepared the household’s
tea,
Or darned the tattered hose.
Perchance she paused to sigh while cutting
bread,
And blushed across the butter, rosy red.
Perchance a soft tear glittered in her eye,
Or trembled on the lid;
Perchance she smiled when no one else was
nigh,
At that sweet thing she lnd,
Close folded in a secret place apart—
Oh, it was good to shelter in her heart.
But at that moment Tom was at the gate,
Kissing the girl good-bye ;
And Letty paused to nut a dimple straight,
And heave a little sigh.
Next morning Tom was seeking work like
me,
And Fred made love beneath the same old
tree.

THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1915.
ON OUR HABIT OF MISTAKING A
TIGER FOR AN ANGRY SHEEP.
Civilisation is mostly a matter of paints,
powders and limelight. A lot of the ape
and tiger-as well as the pig. porcupine and
adder goes to the rthlke-np of humanity.
The reality of a war in which five of the
foremost nations of the world are wrestling
in death grips has shown us with lurid dis-
tinctness the immense distance we have yet
to travel before we become what we pretend
to be. Individually, most of the German
people appear to be kindly, well-disposed and
industrious; yet Germany can violate
treaties, break all the rules of war, commit
all kinds of nameless abominations in con-
quered cities and, as a nation, descend to
depths Which, if we are to believe reliable
Roman writers, would have shocked to the
last whisker the rude forefathers of the race
2000 years ago.- Individually, Englishmen
are not brutal, but under the stress of war
Asquith, the kindest of Englishmen, speak-
ing for the nation at large, can decree a
complete blockade of German ports. Many
a Frenchman or Russian who, six months
ago, would have shrunk from striking a
private blow is to-day rushing forward with
madness in his eye, eager to disembowel men,
and entirely reckless of the asronies of human
creatures in torment. All this goes to show
that civilisation is mainly built upon con-
ventions, not upon any innate refinement of
the human race. While there is a set con-
vention. that killing men is not the. thing,
ordinary citizens will recoil in horror from
it: but the moment the convention is changed
and killing men becomes reputable and
praiseworthy, they take it as a matter of
course and go at it as enthusiastically as
Apache Indians.
* * * *
The conventions are fixed by nations. For
all the talk of individualism, of the rights
of private judgment and enterprise, the
single citizen is never allowed to far out-
run the community of which he is a part.
The world advances or retreats by nations
and in solid formation, not by the progress
of individuals in single file. In times of
quiet the communal mind is mostly asleep
and a man here and there may seem to do
almost any old thing he pleases; but in
hours of stress the nation wakes up, and its
mind, which is a sort of instinctive affair
produced by the more or less crude thinking
of all its component parts, is strongly as-
serted. Then the individual is swept along
in the main current of the nation’s will and
does all sorts of things he never dreamt
were in him to do. The differences be-
tween the conventions of peace and those
of war are very largely the differ-
ences between the thoughts of those
individuals who are in the nation’s lead
and the instinctive thought of the nation as
a whole. War such as that which now
deafens Europe would be impossible if civil-
isation were a reality and all men thought
as in times of peace the policeman compels
them to act. It is this very fact which
vitiates all the arguments of the Peace
Society. If the world consisted of kindly,
philanthropic old gentlemen in spectacles, the
nations could disarm at once. But the
world doesn’t. It contains a lot of people
with the instincts of the cave-man, a lot
more with the moral outlook of the old
vikings, a sprinkling with the ethics of the
modern housebreaker, a considerable number
who approach things much as the barons of
the Middle Ages did, and some others who
feel when they are roused like French Revo-
lutionaries in the Reign of Terror. When
all sorts and conditions of people get think-
ing together the result is the national mind
or spirit which makes war possible and the
Peace Society a voice crying in the world’s
coal-cellar.
Australia from its peculiar position is apt
to misunderstand these things. The people
of this continent have gone along for more
than a century without knowing what national
danger means. In the long peace which
followed the smashing of Napoleon at
Waterloo the various States of the Com-
monwealth came into existence. In the
one century out of the 30 of which we have
something like accurate knowledge—which
showed the largest amount of human pro-
gress and produced on the surface the
strongest humanitarian sentiment —every-
thing that we call Australian grew and
developed. The Commonwealth is the
world’s one favored nurseling which has
lived from first to last the sheltered life.
The minor shooting affair at Eureka Stock-
ade was our only taste of war; the problems
of wealth and poverty have never been acute
here as in other lands; the complex
machinery of modern life was ready to our
hands from the day we threw aside the baby’s
feeder and accepted the knife and fork of
responsible government; and always around
us was the helping and protecting sea —a
highway for commerce and a barrier against
encroachments. Australia has always seen the
best side of the world, and has always been
very much inclined to take it at its own valu-
ation. A product of the world’s most civil-
ised age, it has been inclined to believe in
civilisation, to rate human progress higher
than it deserves to be rated, and to accept
the sentiments of the world’s best thinkers as
those really governing nations of men. Such
an attitude of mind, while making for a high
standard of thought and feeling, is itself a
very grave danger. The tiger, however do-
mesticated in the menagerie, is still a tiger;
and once the bars are down he is as dan-
gerous in George-street as in the jungle east
of the Irawadi. Australia’s too-sanguine
estimate of world-feeling is coupled with a
too-sanguine estimate of itself. Having
known itself only in times of profound peace,
or at worst when there was a far-off echo of
tumult from the other side of the planet, it
has no notion of what it would really be like
when race-war and race-hate turned all its
conventions upside down.
Never are these things more apparent than
when Australian politicians babble about
Defence. Their every utterance makes it
perfectly clear that they have no sort of
conception of what an Asiatic invasion of
this continent would really be like. They
have treated Defence preparation from first
to last as if it were something in the nature
of play. Like the big French statesman of
the seventeenth century, who declared that
the first needs of the people were street
pageants, the men who govern Australia seem
to think that all we need is enough show of
military activity to allay the fears of the
public. For their purpose an armed school-
boy is quite as useful as a trained soldier,
and an alleged strategic railway from one
point that is comparatively safe to another
that is not in the least danger, fills all the
requirements of a political system whose be-
all and end-all is getting into office and
staying there. Andrew Fisher and those
who share his outlook must be shaken up
and made to see things as they are if there
is to be any permanent safety for this
country. Australia is not one whit safer
to-day than Belgium was 10 years ago, and
every wasted moment adds to our danger.
Belgium found a foe more ruthless than
had been deemed possible; but Australia may
have to face an enemy which on all the
showing of past history would be to the Ger-
man as a whole herd of infuriated tigers to
a pack of trained hounds. Asia on the war-
path is the most awful thing this planet has
known, and it is in the light of that know-
ledge that Australian defence must be
viewed.
If Australia’s probable invaders were the
people of a rival white State with whom we
had quarrelled about the right to trap whales
in Torres Strait, or whom we had goaded
into exasperation by claiming that we had a
divine mission to collect guano from one of
their outlying possessions, our arrangements
for defence would be bad enough, because,
barring miracles, the other State’s arrange-
ments for invasion would be better; but,
apart from the loss of life and the cash which
we would be compelled to hand over as in-
demnity at the finish, nothing of a very
appalling nature eouid happen to us. But
Australia has no hope of conducting gentle
parade-ground warfare of that kind. When
the blast of battle blows on this continent,
the other party will be a foe who has decided
that there is not sufficient room on this globe
for his needs and our abundance. The fight
will be to a grim and awful finish ; and if
once that invader makes good a footing, the
story of ravaged Belgium will be a nursery-
tale beside the record of deeds done on our
own shores. Yet in spite of this sure
knowledge we still palter and waste time.
Lately we have prepared a few men for for-
eign service, and we have seen that, after all
the supposed hard work in our local camps,
the British military authorities still deemed
it necessary to give them months of further
training before exposing them to the risks
of European warfare. Yet the men sent
on to Egypt were every wav more soldierly
than those who have been drilled in our child
armies for home defence. While things
remain as they are we stand to face a crisis
unparalleled in the history of a young nation,
with an inadequate number of insufficiently-
trained men, so placed that they have no
hope of getting within striking distance of
the danger point until the invader has had
time to make his landing good and his posi-
tion on our shores secure. And to meet such
a calamity as this Andrew Fisher proposes
to make a comic-opera railway from nowhere-
in-particular to anywliere-it-isn’t-wanted!
Could fatuity go farther?
THE TRUE AND HITHERTO UNPUB-
LISHED HISTORY OF THE TROJAN
WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tite cannon of a hundred kings,
Flamed with blue lightnings, scourged the
wall,
While aeroplanes on lofty wings
Let crimson streaks of ruin fall.
With charge on charge and yell on yell
Both armies in their millions fell.
The eight-foot howitzers were laid
On concrete bases firm and stout;
Each shot could murder a brigade
Or knock a tidy fortress out;
And all the night and all the day
Both sides were sternly kept at bay.
The line betwixt the east and west
Was eighteen hundred miles or more,
And eagerly to battle prest
Twelve gross or so of army corps ;
The cash of all the world was spent
In that terrific argument.
None living now can tell aright
The causes leading to the strife.
Some tale of Here’s holy spite
And Menelaus and his wife
That herdsmen and the like believe
The wandering minstrels tried to weave.
The actual causes were involved.
I .think the trouble mostly lay
With one large empire that resolved
By force of arms to spread its sway
Over the small and busy States
That ate baked beans at Asia’s gates.
The emperor of Turkestan
Had mobilised his Cossack spears;
An angry murmur westward ran
And hit pale Japheth’s listening ears.
A white book issued at Cabul
Explained the whole affair in full.
Damascus trembled with affright;
The daily press of Thebes declared
That Egypt, if it came to fight,
Was ready armed and well prepared,
With guns and ships and armored trains
And Zeppelins and aeroplanes.
The strong Siculian navies rode
On'peaceful seas their arms had won,
And every new-built dreadnought showed
With pride its ninety-five inch gun,
While ’neath the splash of wavelets green.
Prowled each attendant submarine.
The world was keen to hear and know
What Sicula and Greece would do.
On every wind that chanced to blow
Some wireless message fluttered through,
But the press censorship was such
It did not tell the people much.
At Tyre the Cabinet resigned.
At Carchemish the Ilittite powers
Some vast defensive works designed
With walls of steel and triple towers.
And then the Tartar empire spoke
And the red dawn of battle broke.
The Phrygian force was mobilised,
Field-marshal Hector in command.
The soldiers in his ranks comprised
Contingents drawn from every land.
The Asian shores with troops were lined
And all the nearer seas were mined.
The Greek Prime Minister arose—
Prince Agamemnon was his name—
“ Our long negotiation shows,”
He said, “the Tartars are to blame.
Egypt, Chaldea, Tyre and Troy
Combine to ravage and destroy.
“Should Greece be neutral in such case,
Now that the flames of war are lit,
The future Europe would efface
Our titles from the map of it.
Leagued with Siculian navies strong.
We stand in arms to right the wrong.”
Exactly what the wrong might be
Was never definite or clear.
Tempestuous war on land and sea
Arose to fill men’s hearts with fear;
In fact, our modern strife was such
Some people thought it hurt too much.
Ten fateful yeai’s the war went on.
The great guns launched their bolts of fire
Till every useful thing was gone
From Egypt’s hinterland to Tyre,
And all the world with graves was full
From scorched Etruria to Cabul.
The ships had all been sunk at sea,
The forts had all been smashed on land, -
Except where Illium proud and free
Remained with Hector in command,
And all the world had grown so sad
Most of the folk alive were mad.
It may be Paris stole a girl
Called Helen at this dreadful time;
It may be that her hair in curl
Was some excuse for such a crime;
I cannot tell, I only know
Troy was the last great fort to go.
The ammunition all was spent,
The guns and rifles all used up ;
Nowhere on either continent
Was found an Armstrong or a Krupp ;
The makers of each war machine
Were in small graves remote and green.
And here oM Homer’s tale comes in.
Mad fancies of this god or that
Were in the wasted brains and thin
Beneath the universal hat,
And mighty Ajax really threw
Blue metal at the Trojan crew.
Achilles really had a spear,
A dinner knife upon a pole,
And when an enemy drew near
He prodded him with all his soul
Until his reputation grew
For deeds peculiar, large and new.
But still the walls of Troy remained,
Great walls the guns had failed to crack ;
And from them loads of brickbats rained
As often as the Greeks came back.
At last the wooden horse affair
Took the defenders unaware;
Of course, a kid of eight or ten
By no such trick could well be had;
But everyone about just then,
As I remarked, was somewhat mad.
The horse once well inside the wall
The fated city needs must fall.
And then the Greeks went sadly hack
Across their little strip of sea.
East, north and west the world was black,
Black with the flames that burnt it free.
The iron shards of death’s machine
Rusted in weeds that blood made green.
The people who remained alive
Forgot whatever they had known.
No trade or calling could survive
That battle cyclone overblown ;
And so the crazy world began
Anew with satyrs, nymphs and Pan. .
In Arcady- they caught a cow
And milked her on a mountain peak,
But none remembered how to plough
And bread and wine were far to seek.
Dull, dazed and crazed, they turned the page
And stept into the Golden Age.
N.S.W.
PAT O’MAORI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bogus Hypothesis of a State Spiter.
Always a nuisance in Federal affairs, it
looks as if Holman wants to keep on living
up to that disastrous tradition. IDuring the
Referenda campaign he helped sprag the
wheel of progress, and now he seems to be
ready to do the same thing again. Return-
ing last week from the latest of his numerous
holidays, this bright young man, placing a
garland of thistles on his brow, proceeded to
launch a torpedo against Hughes’s observa-
tions on the scope and effect of the High
Court’s recent interpretation of the Constitu-
tion in the wheat cases. The torpedo was
disguised as a verbal poser, and on examina-
tion turns out to be filled with a large quan-
tity of rubbish. Supposing there was only
one Government, that of the Commonwealth;
and supposing a farmer at Temora (N.S.W.;
had 500 bushels of wheat; further sup-
posing wheat was wanted for soldiers at
Sydney. Then the nebulosity to whom this
mythical problem was put had to go on sup-
posing that the Temora cocky didn’t want to
sell his wheat at Sydney, but for a higher
figure which had been offered him at Mel-
bourne. Having supposed alb this, Holman
with an air of finality demanded to know
whether there was anyone outside a lunatic
asylum ready to suggest that the State should
be prevented in consequence of; the doctrine
of freedom of inter-State trade from seizing
the property of the supposititious hayseed, in
order that the famishing soldiery might be
provided with an adequate ration. The
answer to this labored hypothesis is, of
course, that no one has ever suggested that
the Commonwealth Government should not
possess those sovereign powers which the
High Court has found it does not possess,
but which still repose in the States. Nor has
the most blithersome of raving lunatics ever
said that, in order to maintain the free flow
of trade between the States, the Constitu-
tion should hamstring the national Parlia-
ment. What has been said is that. a Con-
stitution which leaves the States in com-
mand of trans-border trade, and the Com-
monwealth impotent to control either that
trade or the subject matter thereof, is not
the Constitution the people bargained for.
Holman pretends to think it is, and to
bolster up his pretence accuses Hughes of
“contending that, because freedom of trade
is guaranteed, the nation has surrendered
the Crown’s right of eminent domain and the
State should not acquire property.” There
has been no such contention, and Holman
must know it. The whole question is
whether the right of a State to hold up
trade in wheat, or peanuts or pumpkins, or
anything else, is not a negation of pre-
Fe'deration desires —whether the powerless-
ness of the allegedly national Government
to handle a peanut or pumpkin crisis is not
a revelation of constitutional imperfection.
Holman’s hypothetical friend with 500
bushels of wheat is a mere blot on the
landscape. But if he must be contem-
plated, there is this to be said about him :
i? the Commonwealth Government seized
his wheat but paid him less than he could
obtain for it in Melbourne or in Kalgoorlie,
it would be not exercising the right of
eminent domain, but committing an act of
robbery. Yet Holman can apparently see
nothing but what is beautifully symmetrical
in a Constitution which permits the peortle
living within certain lines drawn across the
map to treat the rest of the population of
Australia as outsiders entitled to no consid-
eration in respect to the produce of another
part. When will he make up his mind and
run away?
Australia Baked or Australia Boiled?
The idea that by taking some kind of eco-
nomic vengeance on Germany after the-war
Australian industry will benefit, and- that
action on these lines is likely .to afford a
satisfactory substitute for genuine tariff re-
form, appears to have gripped many people
so firmly that they can think of nothing else.
The consequence is that from all points .of
the Commonwealth come resolutions ranging
from “never more” to an emphatic declara-
tion that in future Billabong or Counta-
quid won’t buy its clothes-pegs or its rabbit-
traps from anybody but existing allies and
neutrals. All of which reduced to simple
words means that Australia should carry on
in the bad old fashion of to-day, with this
one small alteration: that, instead of re-
ceiving vast piles of German merchandise,
heaps of goods should be weighed in froni the
ports of other countries. Australian indus-
trial enterprise can receive no. assistance
from such a creed. If we must import hats
and chairs it doesn’t matter to Australia in


the economic sense whether these come by
way of Hamburg or Boston. In either case
the deal is equally bad. If instead of send-
ing to Berlin for socks these articles are
ordered from Madrid, the position of the
Australian weaving industry remains un-
altered, and the Australian citizen who
wears socks has a foreign covering on his
feet all the same. Refusal to. admit that
Australian industry should receive any con-
sideration can at least be understood; but
the suggestion that the nation can benefit
by throwing out imported manufactures of
one brand and laying in full stocks of the
same things bearing different marks is ridi-
culous. When a ship springs a leak at sea
the main object of the crew is to patch up
the hole—not to arrange that while one
watch checks the unwelcome inflow the other
works witli the utmost speed opening a new
leak, so that the sinking may go joyfully on.
What Australia wants, and must have, is
the protection of Australian factories and
workmen against foreigners of every kind—
not because the community wants to damage
an outsider’s industry, but because it doesn’t
want an outsider to come along and strangle
its own. Whether the outsider who does the
strangling is known as Hans von Schmidt
fir Guglielmo Macaroni, the consequences
to the victim are no less painful.

The Crime of the Falaba.
Knowing the manner in which atrocities
are apt to be manufactured by half-
demented refugees and imaginative space-
writers, most temperate people were dis-
posed to discount the excited stories of Ger-
man ruthlessness and beastliness circulated
during the earlier months of the fight. It
is obvious, however, that, loath though men
and women were to accept as trustworthy
the evidences of barbarity then placed before
them, no reason now exists for believing the
German to have been maligned. He may
possibly not be guilty on every count of the
voluminous indictment, but the strongest
possible corroboration of the testimony
against him on the charges of wholesale
murder, arson, rape and torture in Belgium
is afforded by his exploits in England and
a« sea. The dropping of bombs on unarmed
flfwns was not war, but wanton, profitless
dffetruction, and the torpedoing of the pas-
senger ship Falaba, the latest achievement
in this particular field of activity, was just
plain, cold-blooded murder, as brutal and
criminal as it could be. That it has
been received with horror by a world already
gorged on a diet of frightfulness may, con-
ceivably, comfort tbe Germanic mind. But
memory of a deed like this is going to make
it pretty hard for Germany as a nation in
the days to come, and mighty hard, too, for
German men .and women individually. It
is possible that Tf lie had a chance to make
“war” in this way the Turk would seize the
opportunity. ;At any rate, he was accus-
tomed to do so before he grew fat and lazy.
The Spaniard at one time in his glittering,
blood-stained career was a murderer of
defenceless enemies' and heretics. But the
place occupied by the- Dons and Pashas of
to-day suggests that a people who set out
on a campaign of' general butchery goes
bankrupt with unexpected suddenness. Con-
templation of that aspect of the matter is
not calculated to add an agreeable flavoring
to the sausages of Frankfurt, no matter
how piquant was the first taste of the news
about the Falaba. >
The Bureau of Prophecy.
From a veteran who established one of the
most important industries in Australia-: —
till The Bulletin’s Bureau of Prophecy is estab-
lished we are all doing the next-best thing: indi-
vidually trying to see and provide for the future.
Let me say what I think will happen very soon.
(1) The Commonwealth Parliament will at its next
meeting devote its attention to the tariff and rail-
ways. The Inter-State Commission will have sent in
its report, and full discussion will be given to a
scientific tariff. Particular attention will be be-
stowed on the quality and quantity of the raw
materials of every description in this great country.
Evidence will be given of our resources in oil
shales, coal, limestone, iron, zinc, lead, copper,
silver and other ores; of the capacity for grow-
ing wheat and other cereals, fruits of ever}' kind,
sheep and cattle of every description. Then the pre-
sent and future consumption will be considered, and
evidence will be given of the growth of population
of Canada and the United States during the past
quarter of a century, under certain fiscal laws. A
tariff will then be adopted and bonuses given, simi-
lar to the Canadian and U.S. laws, and we shall see
a similar increase in population. In addition, we
shall see the surcharge policy of Maoriland, as
adopted by Mr. Seddon. From the M.L. tariff list
I find that on certain articles where there is a duty
of 10 p.c. there is a surcharge of 20 p.c. on goods
from outside the Empire. With such a policy in
Australia I can see thousands of men in constant
employment at good wages, producing from our raw
materials the finished articles we are yearly import-
ing.
(2) The tariff to be passed next session will give
security to capital in money, brain and labor, and
such an era of prosperity in Australia as was never
before known or dreamt of. In order that capital of
every sort will be secured, officers will be appointed
to examine the balance-sheets of every employer for
taxing purposes. After the bank rate of interest for
overdrafts has been paid on money capital, the sur-
plus will be disposed of amongst all classes of capi-
tal engaged in the business. For instance, say, the
money capital is £100,000; salaries and wages
paid, £50,000; net profits made, £lO,OOO. Say,
6 p.c. on money capital = £6OOO, leaving £4OOO to
be divided on £150,000. The amount due to labor
will be spent in a percentage increase in wages dur-
ing the next six months. If at the end of the next
six months there is a loss, then wages will be re-
duced accordingly. The relation between Capital
and Labor will be altered entirely during the next
10 years. There will not be the millionaires on or.e
hand, or the very poor on the other.
(3) The whole railway system of Australia will be
put under the Commonwealth Government. Instead
of six sets of Railway Commissioners, with their
respective staffs and working systems, each engineer
having different views as to sizes and sections of
material to be used, there will be one uniform
standard throughout Australia, and uniform gauge as
far as N. S. Wales, Victoria, South Aus., Westralia
and Northern Territory are concerned. A uniform
system of charges will be adopted, giving the mini-
mum rates for conveyance of the products of the
soil to the market. All seeds and manures of every
kind will be conveyed free. The present system of
carrying live stock will be done away with entirely.
All conveyances for stock will be coupled the same
as passenger coaches are coupled, and the American
system will he adopted. The question of cheaper
and better transportation will he thrashed out and a
scheme adopted. lVe have not inland rivers always
navigable; therefore prosperity for a great part of
Australia depends on the rail transportation afforded.
(4) The development of Australia can be increased
only by extension of our railways; therefore the
Government will consider the question of deferring
the building of the capital city on borrowed money
until a more favorable time. The same argument
should apply to the building of the Sydney City
Railway. Defer it, and in the meantime economise,
doing away with the expense of State Governors,
among other things.
(5) The question of borrowing will have the
serious consideration of the thinking people of Aus-
tralia.
(6) Finally, I predict a bright future for Aus-
tralia. But it won’t just come —it will have to be
worked for.

The Headache in the Morning.
“Quill” refuses to be cheerful: —
It is cabled from London that the action of the
British Government in taking a proprietorial grip of
certain industries, whose output may be direetty or
indirectly required in connection with war, is viewed
by Socialists with great glee. They are reported to
regard the situation as the “realisation of their wild-
est dreams.” This explosion of joy is premature.
That the war will profoundly change the current of
politico-economic thought may be taken as certain;
but in what direction is not yet even moderately
clear. The world will not be quite the same when
the riot of bloodshed finishes; but exactly where
the changes will be found, and what they all will
lead to, can only be vaguely guessed at, since the
war is not going to end to-day nor to-morrow, nor
the day after to-morrow. But one positive fact that
sticks up in the midst of speculative doubts like the
spike on a Uhlan’s helmet is that all this orgy of
destruction and waste and bloodshed —this squander-
ing of what mankind can make, and of what armies
and navies need —will have to be paid for. The
bill will be delivered in due course, and must be
met. And when it comes in, humanity will for a
time be staggered by the bulk of the dead horse to
be worked off. The mighty burden will only be
got rid of by long years of toil and a courageous
resolution to take the right hard road instead of
the wrong easy one. The sole consideration at pre-
sent is victory in a struggle for life; and whether
the necessarily hasty and more or less reckless ex-
pedients resorted to in this crisis will be followed in
the later period of scratching round for dollars, is
not clear enough to cause joy. Prices, costs, conse-
quences —none of these things are being closely con-
sidered now, except from one single point of
view. Millions of borrowed capital are being flung
into the fiery furnace of war every week, and more
will be heaved in the same direction until the task
of clearing away the slag and cinders begins. It will
probably happen that in Britain the State may be
driven to take a greater share in the direction of
industry, thus following the lines proved so profit-
able by Germany ; but the step will be taken under
circumstances which, instead of “realising the wildest
dreams” of Socialists, may lead to the realisation of
their gravest fears.
_ «
The Regular Who Has Been
Side-tracked.
Before all the posts of honor and distinc-
tion in the new Expeditionary Forces have
been filled, the claims of Australia’s profes-
sional soldiers ought to be further consid-
ered. In peace time, these specialists, who
have dedicated their lives to tlioir profession,
have nothing to look forward to under a
system whereby an officer who has reached
the Retiring age gets no pension. With the
inevitable expenses of moving from station to
station, it is practically impossible for him
to save sufficient out of his meagre salary to
provide for his old age; consequently, the
outlook —save in one direction —is a blank.
The one possible way of escape from a penu-
rious old age is that a period of active ser-
vice will give the trained and competent man
a chance to prove himself and climb out of
the ruck. That is all he asks. It is safe to
say that in Britain no highly-trained regular
officers such as we keep manning the coastal
defences are left pining for active employ-
ment, while amateur and semi-amateur
officers with political pull and freedom to use
it are hoisted into high commands. While
the Scliarnliorst and other German cruisers
were afloat there was, no doubt, an excellent
reason for keeping the trained Australian
artilleryman close to his gun and his search-
light. The coastwise vigil was long and
arduous, and how well it was kept will
probably never be widely known. But now
that Yon Spee is dead and his ships sunk,
the look-out over these remote seas cannot be
regarded as much more than a military for-
mality. It would not only be safe, but it
would be merely also fair, to frbe for further
service and experience abroad the men who
have served us so well at home. They have
fairly earned their chance, and those
that survive will be all the more
valuable to Australia for the first-
hand knowledge they will have gained of
active-service conditions. Regarding the
whole thing solely as a matter of business, it
seems foolish to leave these valuable assets
to depreciate in idleness when employment
will make them so much more valuable. If
the Defence Department should in these days
unhappily overlook the men who have loyally
devb'ted their lives to soldiering, in favor of
those who have merely devoted their leisure,
it will not command the high type of officer
it wants in the future. Once let young Aus-
tralia get the idea the amateur soldier
who comfortably runs a bank or a ware-
house makes a good living, and acquires a
social “pull” is the man who gets the
chances, and Australia will presently have to
beg for second- and third-class men to take
on soldiering as a regular thing for the
wages of a senior clerk and the old-age pro-
spects of a hall-porter. No doubt we have
been fortunate in the many fine amateur
soldiers we have produced. But the more
highly-trained professional who has stood to
the guns during the long years of peace
when there was nothing in it but a pittance,
should receive first consideration now. He
shouldn’t be left sitting in a moss-grown fort
looking at the empty sea and waiting for
advancing age to push him out of the only
job he knows.
The Beer Pump in Maoriland.
As the official figures in connection with the
liquor poll taken in Maoriland last Decem-
ber have only just been issued, it looks as if
somebody knocked off work during the tally
to see a man about some dogs. But the
figures being at last on tap, Bung has again
retired behind a hogshead to gloat over the
verdict of the jury, while the brethren of the
water-waggon have assembled to ask one
another sadly what it all means. The figures
have no other meaning than that wowser-
dom got hit—hard. For 12 years, at four
successive polls, the percentage of the com-
munity who by their votes expressed a
desire to sweep drink off the face of the
earth (and by their aggregate consumption
of booze showed themselves to be liars and
whited sepulchres) had mounted steadily up-
wards, what time the army behind Bung
painfully diminished in bulk. But this
time the citizens —who voted in larger num-
bers than ever—-swung completely round,
stuck vine leaves in their cadies, gave three
cheers for malt, and chased the curate away
from the beer pump. For national prohibi-
tion the vote diminished 12,748 and against
the drought it grew 51,781, these figures
representing a change of 7 per cent, each
way. An explanation from which the anti-
liquor brigade pretends to derive comfort
is that “the war had an overwhelming influ-
ence” ; but as this is clearly meaningless the
conclusion must be that the wowsers are
feeling pretty dazed. Meanwhile, Bung
doesn’t bother about the psychology of the
crowd, mainly, perhaps, because his intelli-
gence isn’t keen enough ; but if he interprets
the verdict given by this poll as an indica-
tion that he can do as he likes, then at next
poll he will be smitten with equal violence.
The anti-drink vote in Maoriland has in the
main been an anti-BuNG vote, and the proba-
bility is that at last poll many electors who
had in the past voted no-license with a clear
conscience, on account of having a good-sized
cupboard at home, saw on this occasion the
possibility of nothing but water, and not
liking the dismal prospect, decided to give
Mr. Publiciiouse another chance. Bung
will be wise in his generation if he thus
interprets the situation, but The Bulletin
is almost prepared to risk the prophecy that
he won’t. Maoriland certainly has no desire
to go completely dry; but it rests almost

Bet the Germans Book After
Themselves!
It is time that well-meaning people who
plead for sympathetic treatment of indivi-
dual Germans in this country were brought
to a full understanding of the adage that
charity begins at home. At a meeting of
the Port Melbourne Labor League, the other
Sunday night somebody complained that
the local municipal council was employing
a German on a stone-breaking job whilst one
of the “old and regular” Australian smashers
of blue-metal was out of work. Whereupon
a local councillor said he knew nothing of
this particular case, “but if there were a
poor German out of work because his fellow
unionists declined to work with him, he
would be the first to try to find him employ-
ment, regardless of what portion of the
earth he happened to be born in.” The Port
Melbourne Labor League is a particularly
pro-British organisation; yet even it has
members who shrink from pushing patriot-
ism to logical conclusions. Millions of Ger-
mans may be worthy citizens, deserving of
humane consideration as individuals; but
in their collective aspect they deserve the
worst that could happen to them. 'The mili-
tary Government of Germany is what the
Germans have made it. If the Potsdam
policy of “frightfulness”—which means the
murdering of non-combatants on land, the
sinking of merchant ships with crews still
aboard them, the wilful burning of cities
and the dropping of bombs on baby visitors
to Scarborough—should vin in der long
r-run, its German admirers all the world
over will love their precious fatherland, more
than ever, and be more than ever contemp-
tuous of the liberally-governed Britain- Which
went under because of its inability to think
the Huns were the treacherous schemers
they have proved to be. The sons of the
empire that Bismarck created have there-
fore no national right to the pity of any-
body when their Potsdamnable Empire is at
war. Why, then, talk of “poor Germans”
when braggart missionaries are preaching
the word of Bismarck and his apostle
Berniiardi to the Belgian heathen? What,
in the name of logic, does Port Melbourne
want with a German stonebreaker who
ought to be at the war? What does any
British country want with any German,
other than a captured soldier? The Ger-
mans started this war with confidence be-
cause they knew that all the “frightfulness”
would be on their side, and all the humane
scruples and sense of decency on the other.
They are now waging war against British
passenger ships, because they have no reta-
liation to fear. The gentler civilisation of
the less military nations has been Ger-
many’s encouragement to plan the villainy
from which Europe is now suffering. There
was always too much Hague convention;
too much “pity the poor civilian.” Let the
Port Melbourne Labor Leaguers study Bel-
gium history up to date, and consider what
submarine and floating-mine warfare has
meant within the past two months. Then
they can ask themselves whether’any “poor
German” who isn’t fighting for his country
is any more deserving of an Australian
municipal job and a halo than the “poor
German” who is fighting for his country.
The State and Marriage.
In their protestations against the registra-
tion of re-marriages, the N.S.W. clergy who
deputationised the local Attorney-General
the other day are on sound ground. The
fact that a marriage may, after being legally
entered into, fall under suspicion by one
or other of the parties, or its mother-in-law,
as insufficiently blessed by Heaven, has
nothing to do with the State. From the State
point of view marriage is a civil contract,
which can only be entered into under cer-
tain fixed conditions, and may be nullified
or broken for certain reasons. Therefore
the State’s duty begins and ends with pro-
viding facilities for the making and regis-
tering of the marriage contract. If Phyllis
and Strephon enter into a contract which
in the eyes of the law is valid, that is the
marriage, and no subsequent “re-marriage”
should be recognised; nor can one be law-
fully recognised, since it merely repeats
something already well and truly done
according to statute. If the first marriage
is invalid because of some legal defect in
the contract the case is different, since then
there is no contract, and it is not a re-mar-
riage that takes place, but an actual mar-
riage. The circular issued by the Registrar-
General with respect to marriages “invalid
from a religious point of view” is without
shadow of justification. With that point
of view the State has nothing to do. Either
a man and woman are married according to
law or they are not, and if they are the
State is by its own law prohibited from
countenancin!’ 1 another marriage by either
party until the contract has been dissolved
by a Court or broken by death. No one
could object to people who have religious
sentiments to gratify or doubts to settle
going through a second or third marriage
ceremony; or even a dozen; but this is
purely a matter of personal choice. For
the State to take any notice of these eccen-
tricities or hobbies would be imoroper, since
they have no legal significance, their recog-
nition would be grossly unfair to children,
and to countenance them might very easily
amount to the encouragement of the basest
kind of deceit.

The feature of the N. S. Wales P.L.L.
conference, as far as it has gone, has been
the way in which the word-spinning of
Holman has again won him ascendancy
over a crowd of delegates who were to a
great extent hostile. They had every reason
to be hostile. Holman, where he has not
outraged the Labor platform, has ignored it.
Labor is pledged to the cessation of borrow-
ing, except under the most stringent condi-
tions. Holman’s borrowings make all
previous records look like the efforts of
feeble amateurs. No. I plank of the Labor
platform is the abolition of the Upper
House. Not only is the Upper House not
abolished, but it has been strengthened by
the inclusion of new members who are not
Labor men and who will not vote for its
abolition. Further, the Holman crowd, in
direct defiance of Labor ideas, liasNjjtered
into the unholy Norton
tract, has imported trawlers that might have
been made in Sydney at a time when work
was wanted there, has shown a strange kind-
ness to the middleman whom Labor seeks
to abolish, and has refused during the
war to go on with the Labor platform.
There were, therefore, many delegates who
went to Conference with the announced in-
tention of bringing the Premier to book ; and
the agenda paper breathed threats of nasti-
ness. But the fashion in which Holman
managed with his first speech to sway the
gathering, and win its applause, indicates
that he will be able to win a majority even
as he did at previous conferences held to
judge him over his conduct in regard to the
Referenda. That a mere word-spinner
should win shows a deterioration in the
quality of the P.L.L. In the. old times it
was often rash, foolish and ridiculous, but
it stuck to its guns and its principles, and 1
would not sanction their violation. Power
has weakened Labor, apparently; certainly
the Conference is sprinkled with delegates
who see bright visions of honors and jobs
and political prizes, and more or less un-
consciously put these before all else.

Now that Victorian Statist Laughton has
got in complete returns of last season’s har-
vest, the size of the disaster that has struck
the State can be seen. Though 300,000 more
acres were sown in wheat the yield was
3,940,947 bushels as against 32,936,245
bushels in the previous year—an average of
1.38 bushels, as against 12.84 bushels. It is;
the suddenest slump on record, and unfor-
tunately the drought that caused it is still
at work. Between now and next harvest there
is plenty of time for fat rains, certainly ; but
though that may mean a big yield per acre,,
the area under crop will be small, because
the ground has been too hard to work. The'
outlook calls for stringent economy,. especi-
ally in relation to every kind of. import;
otherwise in order to pay the bill—including;
the interest bill —the State, in the absence,
of merchandise, will have to ship its gold ;
and then there will soon be serious trouble.
Deputy-Premier Cann (N.S.W.) has had
figures prepared showing that day-labor jobs
cost ever so much less than contract jobs—
Newtown Infants’ School 15350, as against
£5577, the lowest tender, and so on. < But
that’s not the point. How much more do
the day-labor jobs cost than they would if
the present system of ca’ canny were not
in vogue, and men did the fair thing which
Cann himself admits they haven’t been
doing during the recent orgy of borrowing
and wild extravagance? Cann at a ban-
quet the other day professed to get comfort
out of the fact that, if they weren’t doing
a fair thing for the State, they were any-
how not doing any better for the private
employer. However much that may console
Cann, it won’t make things any easier for
the people who will have to pay the prin-
cipal some day, and meantime have to make
good the difference between what the work
earns and what the loan costs. If a work
costs £200.000 £9OOO will pay the present
interest bill. But if it costs £300,000 the
interest bill will be £13,500; and either the
users of the work or the general taxpayers
have to make up the extra £4500. •
A Melbourne P.M. lately expressed sur-
prise that meat which the inspectors had
rejected as unfit for export had been con-
sidered quite good enough for local consump-
tion, and had been placed in a freezing
chamber with that intent. Unfortunately,
or fortunately, it was so advanced that next
morning it fled away to the city desiccator.
If that P.M. will delve into the problem a
little below the surface, he will learn what
many countries —Japan in particular have
already discovered, viz., that in. order to meet
its obligations, a borrowing nation, if it keeps
on borrowing long enough, always must
export its best and use its inferior products
itself. It is one of the indirect but none
the less certain penalties of borrowing
abroad.

The muzzle seems to have been strapped on
over the war news more tightly than ever,
and the official communique is mainly re-
markable for even greater vagueness than
before. Of what- is happening now along
the dykes and dug-outs in Flanders the world
knows just about as much as it does of
occurrences in Poland—which is practically
nothing. News came along one day during
the week that the Huns had been rehearsing
a retreat through Liege; the next morning
there were circumstantial stories of Ger-
man reinforcements being hurried to the
Belgian front. The only certain thing ap-
pears to be that the whiskered von Tirpitz,
having decided that the Emperor’s navy
shall not fight another navy, is devoting
great attention to blowing up tramp steam-
ers and fishing smacks. The heroic German
sailors contihue chasing these harmless
’ objects of wrath with such marvellous cour-
age that the supply of Iron Crosses will soon
be exhausted. The position in South-eastern
Europe is just as obscure as elsewhere.
Bands of “irregulars” are reported to have
made an attack oil the Servian rear, and
others to have been in collision with Greeks.
Whether this means that the Bulgar is
taking the field with Turkey is not yet clear.
Meanwhile, Lloyd George is being bom-
barded with letters by the cartload about
beer; and)!! generally speaking, there are
indications that the great heart of the
Empire is going to be as much stirred by
discussion of booze as by struggling to un-
ravel confusing records of execution with
bayonets.
“If he were dying in the gutter, I wouldn’t
give him a brief,” said Richard Denis
Meagher of one of Holman’s barrister friends.
Of course Richard Denis wouldn’t. The
Full Court sees to it that Richard doesn’t
give anybody a brief.
The defeat of Premier Peake at the just-
past South Aus. elections was not altogether
unexpected. As Premier his dignity would
not allow him to drop the rocky Victoria
electorate and “contest” a Liberal strong-
hold. Had his party got a majority the
yarn goes that, in the event of the leader’s
defeat, young Butler (“Dismal Dick’s”
second son), who had one of the compara-
tively safe seats for Wooroora, was to resign,
and Peake was to take the seat, and thus
scramble back to office.
Among the last batch of appointments to
the N.S.W. Leg. Council was one Brown, a
barrister of some reputation in certain
branches of law. Brown, having voted
against some of the Holman measures, the
well-fed Mr. Richard Meagher removed his
cigar at the P.L.L. Conference, to “protest
against the action of the Government in brief-
ing this gentleman in several important
cases,” and to remark that if the aforesaid
Brown was “dying in the gutter I wouldn’t
give him a brief.” This malevolent outburst
rested not on any contention derogatory to
Brown’s capacity to give the Crown good
service as counsel, but on the preposterous
notion that Brown, when he became a mem-
ber of the Council, surrendered such brains
as he may possess to the custody of the men
who appointed him.
After the dust had subsided from the col-
lapse of Beard Watson’s five-storey Sydney
warehouse in March, 1914, the co. began a
healthy-looking lawsuit against its maybe
thoughtless or allegedly negligent landlord,
the Dixson Trust, for compensation. So far,
there have been a few preliminary canters in
the courts, but the suit itself is as far ad-
vanced as when the defendant filed certain
pleas in reply to the plaintiffs’ claim. There-
abouts, the plaintiffs delivered a demurrer to
the landlord, and the Full Court, having
dandled the newcomer on its knee, said it
was a fine child, and awarded it much costs
as its dowry. Then the High Court was
called in, looked askance at the demurrer, and
refused to bless or curse it. Instead, it in-
sisted on the parties getting on with the
original case, promising, in due course, to
take an interest in the demurrer. Already
the accumulated cost-s are up to where the
second floor was, and nobody knows whether
the defendant’s pleas are good or bad,
although seven Judges, four K.C.’s, and a
dozen barristers and solicitors and half the
pubs in Sydney have argued around them for
19 months.
J. 11. Finlayson has passed over at last,
in Adelaide. He was one of the most bril-
liant of the fine lot of scholars turned out
by J. L. Young’s school in the middle of
last century—C. C. Kingston and L. 11.
Sholl were among his contemporaries—and
the Register office snapped him up as a
youngster. In five years he was chief-of-
staff, in 10 acting-editor. From 1878 to
1897 he was editor, as well as part proprie-
tor. Then he made way for W. J. Sowden,
and put in 10 years in London as corres-
pondent there. Since 1908 he had been
back in Adelaide, latterly quite broken down
in health. lie ivas not told of the death
of his only son, Harvey Finlayson—by motor
accident in Melbourne, recently—and the

“Liberty Hall,” a pretty little machine-
made comedy by R. C. Carton, w-as revived
for the reappearance of Violet Paget’s cap-
able stock company at Sydney Little Theatre
on Saturday. The plot concerns a haughty
lady who almost faints at the mention of a
shop; a titled eccentric, the heir to The
Estate, who pretends to be a traveller
in soap; and the inevitable love
affair between the snobbish lady and her
aristocratic admirer in disguise. The Eng-
lish dramatist’s point of view can hardly be
expected to appeal to a community whose
aristocracy is shop. R. C. Carton’s charac-
ters soliloquise frequently, they speak in
stilted language, and the situation which
closes the third act —a man on his knees to
the wrong woman, discovered by the woman
he loves—is wantonly treated in heroics and
without the use of common-sense. This fault
of artificiality is, however, confined to the
hero and the heroine ; the subsidiary charac-
ters are delightfully real. Chief among
them is William Todman, a humble book-
seller, designed on Dickens lines, a dear old
man radiating good-nature and optimism,
booky in talk and kind of heart. This charac-
ter affords Arthur Cornell the opportunity
of a fine study; and he is to be congratulated
on having freed himself from certain man-
nerisms that had detracted from some recent
similar character studies. Gerald Kay
Souper does bis capable best with the stiff
material supplied for the part of the mas-
querading hero. Kenneth Brampton and
Victor Fitzherbert ably characterise two im-
portant minor parts —the latter actor is an
asset to this company. Violet Paget, who in
the absence of her husband, Hugh Buckler
—at the war —carries on the company,' has
a congenial part as the aristocratic lady
compelled to accept shelter in her poverty
from a person so low in the human scale as
to keep a bookseller’s shop. Her work is
always refined, and in this part she manages
to make even her stilted speeches sound
natural. The support of the company is
admirable. Here is a comedy that must not
be taken too seriously; but there is plenty
in it that will genuinely amuse.
“SINBAD THE SAILOR,” AT
SYDNEY A DELPHI.
Sinbad (Olive Mansion) and Comic Sailors
(Frank Crossley and Darcy Kelway).
A curious disarrangement of pomp and
circumstance prevents this paper saying all
that it would like to say of “The Lifeguards-
man,” announced as the last production of
the Julius Knight-Irene Browne season,
now nearing its end at Sydney Royal. If
the German Pirate King and old Franz
Joseph of Austria, acting in conjunction,
hadn’t forced the hand of Servia last July,
and so precipitated the great war now rag-
ing ; and if the Anglican Archbishop of Syd-
ney had not failed to vanquish his old
enemy, the Easter Cow, who defies Holy
Writ and keeps open on Good Friday; if
neither of these disjointed things had hap-
pened, then half the staff of this paper
wouldn’t have gone away to shoot strangers
or train for the performance; also, a few
thousand country Show visitors wouldn’t
have come to town to fill the theatres so
full that a critic who turned up on Saturday
night, only to find that his tickets were foi
the following Monday- night, would have been
able to get in somewhere instead. of going
quietly away and witnessing an irrelevant
picture show. As this paper’s representa-
tive couldn’t get in when he attended, and
couldn’t (for reasons before mentioned) at-
tend when he could get in, the paper lias, for
the present, no official knowledge of the
alleged soldier, and cannot vouch for him or
back his dramatic bill. As has been shown,
the unfortunate man is the victim of the
war, the Easter Cow and a few other things,
including the high price of full stops.
TWO OF THE “RED DANDIES,"
BRISBANE.
Claude Dampier as a sad Toreador , and Oliver
Peacock , the light tenor.
To speak bluntly, the reason why people
go to “Bought and Paid For,” at Sydney
Criterion, is that they want to see an
annoyed husband smash in the locked door
of his wife’s bedroom. All the rest —the
drunkenness of the husband (Charles Mill-
ward), though his condition is a mellow
work of art, the hysterics of the shocked
wife, and the almost pathetic comedy of a
New York clurk-—is but padding. Intending
patrons are advised to book seats on the
prompt side of the theatre in order to gain a
good view of the celebrated door-smashing
act.

For the sixth, or maybe it’s the twenty-
sixth, time Allen Doone has revived “Barry
of Ballymoore” in Sydney. The deed was
done on Saturday night at the Palace, and
Doone, Edna Keeley and the rest of the
co., reassembled after a few months’ rest
cure, were shown what the Irish-Australian
spirit can do in the way of welcome when
its favorite bhoys and colleens come to
town. Although “Barry of Ballymoore” is
a mere trifle (Doone in his announcements
properly describes it as “a pretty costume
play”), it goes better in Sydney than any
piece in the Doone-Keeley repertoire. On
Saturday the work of the cast and the danc-
ing kiddies (good business, theirs) was as
pleasantly performed as it has been hitherto,
and at the curtain there was a flower gala.
Anyhow, that’s what it looked like.
* * * *
“Cinderella,” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
is doing as well as can be expected by the
most optimistic manager this streaming
Easter. The indomitable country people
keep splashing along, and the cloak-room
gives off a dankness that suggests pawn-
shops and the dark days to come. But
inside all is merriment and complete sol-
vency and legs and sweet music.

“Sinbad the Sailor” does liis trick at the
Sydney Adelplii wheel these times in glis-
tening oilskins. There is a full passenger
list every trip, and the amazing youthfulness
of Sin.’s mother keeps the travellers amused
till the enchanted old craft reaches its
journey’s end and ties up to the clock. By-
way of variety there will be a matinee on
Thursday this week.
The week-end changes at Sydney Tivoli
include Rosa Hamel, a female cartoonist
who sketches as she sings; and Sterzelly and
his dog “Lucky,” a small, intelligent animal
that yelps in time to its own piano accom-
paniment. The writer has heard accredited
serio-chronics do worse. For the rest,
Alfredo, the respectable vagabond violinist,
makes a reappearance; Odiva describes
beautiful ■ curves in her tank; Thorne and
Leopold dance and sing; and J. W. Ripkaby
hands out laughs without any visible effort.
George Mozart finishes his season to-night

Wirths’ Circus pavilions, at Prince

gibber for goloshes; but the elephant is
quite cheerful about it —his time-defying
hide was built for wear in a more violent
age.

“Bill Adams,” which comes under the
managerial heading of “sparkling farce
comedy,” made its threatened appearance at
Melbourne King’s last Saturday. The
trouble with this inoffensive work of fiction
is _ that it sparkleth not, neither does it
shine. “Bill Adams” is just the simple
story of a hearty, noisy old liar, placed in
the centre of a small social circle of incred-
ibly credulous simpletons, who listen when he
talks. Considered apart from Bill they are
conspicuously foolish residents of an Eng-
lish village in the year a.d. 1865; but
whenever the shadow of Bill falls across
their lives they are as destitute of all human
sense of absurdity as a tribe of born idiots
in Arcadia. The two least inane characters
are a soft-spoken young man who loves
Bill’s daughter, but cautiously alludes to his
father-in-law-elect as a baldheaded impostor,
and a hairy, inopportune old mariner who
knew Bill as a youth, and remembers how
the arm which he didn’t lose at the Battle
of Waterloo was torn from his shoulder in
a sawmill. The witless farce has eight
characters. They live on their simplicity
through four short acts. One touch of cyni-
cism or a stroke of robust humor would
knock the narrative out in the second round,
but as nothing happens to disturb the puer-
ility of the proceedings the audience stays
to the finish.
»*■.*■*
Poor “Bill” is quite handsomely staged
and cleverly acted. Charles Brown plays
the name part with confidence and vigor,
and Knight utters the silly mala-
propian maxims of Mrs. Sawkins in a man-
ner that disarms derision. Carleton Stuart,
as the mariner who breaks Bill up, is an
impressive personality; Harry Paulton,
jun., is a likable low comedian; Herbert
Ford and Miss Macpherson are a pleasant
pair of lovers; A. Albert and Ethel Buckley
try hard to be amusing under difficulties.
Many a much better comedy has been not
nearly so well performed.
* *. * *
“High Jinks” is jinking along cheerfully
at Her Majesty’s (Melb.); The pretty
backgrounds and the industrious, gaudy
chorus are more than half the battle .in
this instance, and though there is nothing
new in the naughtiness of the story, it has
at least the merit of consistency in the com-
plications. Some musical comedies detach
themselves from the narrative in the middle
of the entertainment and wander aimlessly
around, but “High Jinks” never breaks
loose. The long arm of coincidence is
always round its waist, so to speak, and the
same perfume on which the Doctor goes
giddy at the outset serves to lull the sus-
picions of his wife to sleep at the finish. If
the attar of joy, which C. H. Workman dis-
penses from a small bottle., could be re-
tailed by every pharmaceutical chemist, this
would be a happy world.
Robert Parker started a series of con-
certs at Melbourne Town Hall last Satur-
and a fairly large audience welcomed
him as an old friend. Parker is not the
most richly tuneful or perfectly smooth
basso-baritone singer the city has heard
sing to a piano accompaniment, but he
is one of the most forcibly dramatic
and personally magnetic. So his airs from
opera, with ballads sandwiched between the
heavier numbers, roused the crowd to en-
thusiastic encores as a rule. Also Mrs.
Carmen Harris, whose voice has gained in
volume and lost a little in sweetness, sang
almost as well as she looked, and a very
interesting stranger (to whom Melba pre-
sented a bouquet) was Miss Florence
Scapini, a gifted young violinist in a short
skirt. The fourth of the Parker concerts
is to-night (Thursday).
“The Naval War,” which broke out at the
Glaciarium (Melb.), on Saturday (last
week’s Bulletin put it at the Auditorium),
seemed fated to suffer in its first appear-
ances from many sins of inexperience. The
city by the tranquil, tank-like sea, stretch-
ing nearly the full length of the building, was
a spectacular success from the jump. The

formance. But the effects of that bom-
bardment of the city were humorously lack-
ing in the horrors of war. Evidently the
defeat of the enemy had not been properly
rehearsed. The only incident that really
“knocked” the house was the chasing of a
liner "by a cruiser, the fugitive vessel ulti-
mately escaping with red fire blazing from its
interior. By the time these remarks come
to light the Naval War will probably have
acquired a lot of realism in the course of
practice. The novelty has a good business
future, without a doubt. All the materials
for a popular attraction being there, vigilant
stage management will soon work them for
all they are worth. A parade of vessels fills
in time before the War begins, and the show,
as arranged at present, lasts about an hour
in all. The two performances a day will
start at three and 8.15.

“HIGH JINKS," AT
HER MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
C. U. Workman looks
plaintive.
At the Royal (Melb.) the things that
never happened at the Baldpate Inn are
still taking place under false pretences.
The 200,000 that a supposititious Sydney
Stirling secreted in the safe continues t > be
flung into the fire by a mythical Edwin
Lester, and the fact that Niblo is sometimes
a real person, and sometimes the hero of his
own novelette, will dawn upon public intel-
ligence every evening at about 10.30 p.m.
until further notice.

Last Saturday’s revival of “The Monk
and the Woman,” at Melbourne Princess’s,
may be regarded as a suitable Easter offer-
ing, inasmuch as it contains a medieval
religious atmosphere and invokes the aid of
the Cross to get the hero out of a difficulty.
The hero, a beautiful young novice, cheer-
fully butts into trouble in the devoted
service of Liane, who has touched him in a
tender place. As the lady’s accepted swain
he bears the scowling enmity of her rejected
suitor, Henri de Montrale, and incurs the
poisonous regard of the royal effigy who
pretends to rule the realm in a sagacious
manner. It is while the holy youth is
frankly discussing the character of the royal
tyrant that he is confronted by the muskets
of the Palace Guard, and cleverly saves him-
self from extinction by flourishing the afore-
said sacred symbol in the faces of the cower-
ing soldiery. Afterwards he defeats de
Montrale in a bit of sword play, and borrows
the identity of that lurid ruffian to wed the
beauteous Liane in the Chapel Royal. Here-
abouts the naughty monarch favors Liane
with unseemly attentions, but a providential
earthquake and eruption transpire, and
apparently blot him out along with de Mont-
rale and their licentious supporters. Ronald
Riley plays the King and affords a distorted
picture of a tremulous gibberer who is seem-
ingly a victim to anaemia and want of sleep.
The wicked de Montrale, by John Kirby, is a
shriek of purple haberdashery frequently
drowned by the noise of a high-pitched fal-
setto and a. pair of heavy feet. George Cross
as_ the novice, Paul, is a lump of sugar roofed
with lovelocks and shod with sandals; while
Miss Renee seems chiefly short of physical
requirements for the large and important
part of Liane. Miss Jean Robertson robs
the character of the Comtesse de Salle of a
great deal of its alleged enchantment; and
Miss Hellmrieh is so far out of touch with
the role of Vernet that the two might be
said to be living apart. Maurice Nodin, as
Captain Armonde, however, is pleasing; and
Ward Lyons, as the monk Peter, is a study
of pot-bellied affability that is good to see.
The romance of “The Monk and the Fe-
male” will be celebrated until further notice.

The Strollers made another change of
programme for their third week at the Mel-
bourne. Auditorium, the latest lot of songs
and frivolities being, on the average, up to
their original standard. Everything in the
musical way is different except, perhaps, the
expression of the young man who mostly
plays piano accompaniments, but sometimes
conducts_ the orchestra; and the burlesque—
‘ The Nigger Minstrels” —is quite a new
departure.
The Tales of James J. Corbett will be
withdrawn from Melb. Tivoli bill after
to-night, but the clever Smith and
Nielson turn and the well-worn second
edition of the Follies go on as before, minus
Alfredo and his violin. Time deals kindly
with two or three items in the Follies. The
Russian dancer says npthing that has grown
stale by repetition, and his silence is always
eloquent. Vera Pearce is beginning to
acquire a more confident style than she
had, and the dancing of kiddie Jean Keath
grows more graceful every week. A great
little artist is Jean.

Phil Smith, assisted by Miss Jessie Bar-
lee, is taking a hand in the entertainment
at Melbourne Bijou this week. The former
J. C. Williamson comedian is now appear-
ing as a juvenile frivoller in an Eton suit,
while Miss Barlee shrinks from gaiety in
two or three lots of unbecoming apparel.
The Bradnas supply a! good, comedy act;
Phillips and Merritt and two others show
off in a farcical episode, “A German Inva-
sion” ; and employment has been found for
the large Hopwood-Foldi lady and a grand
piano. Reappearers who are getting a kind
welcome are Irve Hayman and Co., in a
divorce sketch, “The Decree Nisi”; and
Albert Toulouse, who laboriously piles fur-
niture into campaniles and balances precari-
ously on the top.

Hoyt’s handsome screen-palace in Mel-
bourne is providing “continuous” pictures
from 11 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., in addition to the
long evening bill commencing at 8. The pro-
grammes at the new emporium on Saturday
were the usual happy mixtures of comedy
and sensation, whereof “Woman” and “The
Trey of Hearts” held most thrilling moments.
The former was an elaborate bellowdrama
notable for a dancing episode, “The Tango
of Death”; the latter featured a paralytic
and his schemes of revenge. At the Olympia,
where Hoyt’s are pursuing the silver of the
populace with unabated energy, the screen
on Saturday had a good deal to disclose
anent “The Millionaire Brigand,” “Red
Regan” and “The Ranger’s Romance.”

Repertory Theatre performances are
due at St. Peter’s Hall next Satur-
day (10th), Monday and Tuesday.
Gregan McMahon’s bill is the same for
each night—“ The Convict on the Hearth,”
by Fenn, “The Taint,” by H. E. Oliphant,
and “Playgoers,” by Pinero. Each is a
one-act show, and some 20-odd repertorians
will get a look in at one or other playlet.
A longer session of Rep. performance is
booked for the Athenaeum Hall next month.

Irma Caron has the Athenaeum Hall
for the last three nights of this
week. Her name is in the public mind
just now, and she was advised to seize the
opportunity to give these concerts and dis-
play her versatile talent. She will appear
in various singing characters from opera,
introduce the Egyptian Invocation to Love,
words and music whereof are by her father,
the late Leon Caron, and play a couple of
violin solos.
“HIGH JINKS
AT HER
MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE.
Florence Vie (the
runaway wife) in
her bathing costume.
Adelaide shows passed through three brief
phases last week. During the first the most
prominent thing in sight was a new lot of
warlike pictures at the Town Hall, brought
along by manager Shephard, in kinemacolor;
not war, but warlike, being army and navy
pictures raked up from Durbar and manoe-
uvres all over the world. The second, or Hot
Cross Bun, stage saw general trimming of
programmes to mark the season. The most
notable thing was a boldly-conceived “Life
of Christ” at West’s. Then on Saturday the
Royal reopened with Gilbert and Sullivan,
and the Tivoli and King’s with good variety
bills. The winter season has begun.
Clarence Goode, who dislodged S. Aus.
Premier Peake from his electorate, is bro-
ther-in-law of Crawford Vaughan, who is to
dislodge him from his portfolio. Goode,
senior, was one of the State’s best-known
station-managers and sheep experts; a son,
Clarence, surprised people who didn’t know
the family’s leanings by accepting a Labor
nomination for a Northern seat in the Assem-
bly ; and a daughter, Evelyn, who has written
a rather brilliant book or two, married
Vaughan and helped him to become Premier.
In the recent jerrymander of S. Aus., things
were so arranged that Goode was crowded
out of his old seat; and he forthwith made
Peake uncomfortable by turning southward.
On March 27 the biter was bit, and Goode
jerrymandered Peake.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Will Dyson is meditating a holiday trip
homo when the European stewpan has sim-
mered down. His intention is to hold shows
of cartoons and caricatures in Sydney and
Melbourne, and deliver frivolous lectures lit
up with lightning sketches of British and
continental celebrities. Already an entre-
preneur is negotiating with Bill for the
Australian tour.
“Melb”: “Camille,” revived at the Prin-
cess’s, was first produced at the little
Theatre des Varieties in ISSO, with Fechter
as Armand and Doche, wife of the orches-
tral leader, as Camille. Both artists sprang
to fame; but the disagreeable play itself
was censured as the most immoral ever
staged. Australia held its breath and first
saw it with Mary Provost; and again there
was an outcry in Melbourne and Sydney.
“Camille” inspired Verdi to write “La
Traviata.” Queen Victoria, then a play-
goer, resolutely set her face against this
opera; but she could not quench it in Lon-
don, where Piecolomini was the rage as
Violetta. It is difficult to recall a suitable
representative of Camille in Australia since
Mary Provost, though almost every leading
actress' has had a shy at it. In my own
judgment Mrs. Potter came nearest the
artistic ideal.
“Jape” : Beaumont Smith is stepping out.
The stock company for Maoriland is to be
formed at the end of the “Glad Eye” tour,
and Smith is off to America within a month
or so to get American plays, and fix up some
sort of arrangement with one or two New
York managers. He has finished a new
Australian play called “The Old School-
house,” in which the children who make
Ethel Turner’s “Seven Little Australians”
will get more opportunities. The whole story
is told in a schoolroom. Smith is also talk-
ing with considerable interest about Adams’s
“The Rag Doll,” in which children appear as
dolls and adults perform as children, while,
to keep the proportions, everything on the
stage is built on the large size. Beau-
mont Smith looks worth watching. He
seems to want to do something with Aus-
tralian goods, anyway.
“Avon”: Tallis, Ward and Meynell have
the performers, costumes and scenery for a
reasonably good presentation of any one of
Shakspeare’s 36 plays. What treasures are
thus locked up! How much the aspiring
actors and actresses would rejoice if Sunday
evening performances of such were allowed!
And how the public would rejoice and flock!
Make a start for the Belgian Fund. Look at
the horrible trash poured forth every Sunday
night by the six or seven picture theatres of
Bourke-street, Melbourne. Officialdom can’t
persist in the strange delusion that this is
good and Shakspeare wicked. The German
barbarians, by the way, see all his plays.
“Theorbo”: A splendid move was made on
Good Friday by the Melbourne Philharmonic,
under fiery young conductor Zelman, in giv-
ing Elgar’s oratorio, “The Kingdom.” No
disrespect is offered to Handel or Mendels-
sohn ; but I hail a great living composer like
Elgar as I would an emulator of “Hamlet”
or “Midsummer Night’s Dream.” He indi-
cates that noble music is not bounded. Llis
first sacred work was “Lux Christi.” The
grudging public, with inevitable musical
Toryism, would not properly recognise this
until the composer had packed on other
works that made him famous—his “King
Olaf,” “Banner of St. George,” and “Carac-
tacus.” Then the really mighty “Dream of
Gerontius,” founded on Newman’s poem,
shone resplendent. Richter, greatest of con-
ductors, generously accorded this the warm-
est recognition. Germany endorsed Britain’s
verdict on this break-up of the traditions
built on “The Messiah” and “Elijah,” which
had hampered all such composers as Stainer
and Cowen. Next came Elgar’s “The Apos-
ties,” the second part of a trilogy com-
pleted by “The Kingdom.” “The Apostles,”
like Mendelssohn’s “Elijah,” was first heard
in Birmingham. Elgar’s Catholic glow carries
him to his loftiest in the immortal passage,
“Upon This Rock I will Build my Church,”
a thing of virile and almost unequalled
beauty.
“Bloore”: I have just hit up against a
remarkable “drummer.” Ilis line is souls,
and his outfit consists of (1) a bonzer
motor-car, (2) one brief bag inscribed “Be
ye reconciled to God,” (3) one soloist, and
(4) one harmonium. He was orating at
Manly, and his message was served up with
large chunks of patriotism and a rendering
of “Tipperary” by the very decent baritone.
The Reverend says he has jettisoned the old
respectable methods, and in place of tracts
left on the seats at gloaming there is to be
a distribution of passes to the local Picture
Palace. In this connection he invites me
to attend on Sunday, guarantees a seat
(adding that it is a “tip-up” one), and says
the subject will be “Manly after Dark.”
By way of padding there ■ will be a full
orchestra and a “popular” sing-song. I
don’t know if there’s to be a collection, but
I am assured by a. local beachcomber that
whether or no he has the other denomina-
tions beaten to a frazzle.
“0.K.”: Mrs. John Wood, a once-famous
London actress with a refined sense of
humor and a strong, stylish personality,
slipped quietly into the Shades the other
week. She was 84 and had scored two or
three successes in Pinero comedy and Drury
Lane melodrama after she was turned 60.
In her younger days her name was associ-
ated with Peabody, the Yankee millionaire
who spent a lot of money philanthropically
in England. She was said to have been one
of the institutions he endowed, and her first
appearances on the London stage were
remarkable for her expensive gowns. The
rich talent for character-acting showed later.
She became then the teacher of a genial
“grand lady” school of actresses —a mistress
in the arts of subtle gesture and voice inflec-
tion, rather than a clever, all-round mum-
meress of the Nellie Stewart order. The
late Fanny Brough and others picked up
their style and notions from the older special-
ist. But her air of distinction was her own.
“0.K.”: Surely the Pointer who speaks
of Oscar Wilde’s “Salome” and “La Sainte
Courtisane” as plays that “cannot possibly
be classed as decadent work” is protesting
too much on behalf of an unduly fussed-
over dramatist. Is there anything of Wilde’s,
from his unmanly cynicism to his mushy
sentiments in poetic piety, which isn’t deca-
dent? The very title is decadent. The idea
of a professional courtesan flying to the
amorous, simple life for Love’s sweet sake,
and then reverting to “gilded sin” in a
martyr spirit so that her disgusted lover may
get respectably married, is a decadent’s idea.
Intelligent men of the world know that acute
sexual passion is incapable of unselfishness,
and that a saintly feminine nature is in-
capable of mixed prostitution. And Wilde
was an observant, thoughtful man of the
world. He drew “La Sainte Courtisane”
from his diseased imagination. “Letusee”
(B. 25/3/’l5) says the play “is full of ten-
derness and of an understanding all the
wider and the fuller from Wilde’s own ghastly
weaknesses.” But the man’s understanding
of his own literary creation was essentially
decadent, and his tenderness was as fraudu-
lent as a harlot’s blush.
The 90-year-old veteran Thomas Bur-
goyne will be missed from the S. Aus.
Assembly. He did not retire, but put up a
brisk fight. Kirkpatrick replaces him, after
a long spell in London as Agent-General.
It will be a very youthful Parliament all
round, Verran, McGiJlivray, Larry O’Lough-
lin and David James (who won a Melbourne
Cup with Auraria) looking like veterans in
it. Richard Butler brings a son back with
him, and a son of the late Premier Tom
Price makes a first appearance. So does
Lionel Hill, the Norwood footballer —now
tramwaymen’s secretary. Some who come
back to the old scene after being out of it
for a term are Peter Allen, journalist and
humorist; Thomas Ryan, formerly chair-
man of an Education Commission ; and E. H.
Coombe, once a Gawler Bunyip editor of
independent views, and now editor of the
Herald, Adelaide’s Labor daily.
A discussion on the totalisator at the Syd-
ney conference of the P.L.L. this week was
mainly remarkable for the large quantity of
irrelevancy talked by Holman. The essence
of what this fly young gentleman had to say
was that the aim of their movement was the
uplifting of the worker’s soul, and he was
filled with a great disgust to find it suggested
that securing a better shade of odds on the
racecourse was to be the crowning achieve-
ment of Labor. The politician who can
babble about souls, denounce the totalisator
and by implication plead that things be left
to a demoralising gang of sharpers, would
be a novelty if his name wasn’t Holman.
MY PARTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When first we met and fell in love, my lot was
sweet indeed ;
Ours was a new romantic play, and lo! I played the
lead.
The other members of the cast gave way—she saw to
that!
And I swelled daily like a frog and revelled in the
“fat.”
Five years went by ere I woke up and saw the bill
was changed ;
Our little co. had settled down and things were
rearranged ;
I was the heavy father now in melodrama style ;
Our youngest kiddie was, of course, the leading
juvenile.
And when, in lonely days to come, they all grow
tired of me,
In clothes grotesque, with reddened nose, an old-time
star I see.
Then, while some modern struts the stage and patrons
vote him prime,
I’ll play the wicked uncle in the family pantomime.

WHEN "OUT OF SORTS” TAKE
“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
If fretful, .jverish, constipated, bilious
or tongue coated, take this delicious
“fruit laxative” at once.
The vague, general discomfort of being
“out of sorts,” when the stomach turns
against food, the eye is dull and the tongue
coated and heavy, can be banished in a few
hours by a dose of “California Syrup of
Figs.” There is no need to put up with these
things until to-morrow, waiting for bedtime
to take medicine. “California Syrup of Figs”
will begin to do you good the moment you
take it —at any hour—and cause no discom-
fort. . This pleasant-tasting, refreshing fruit
laxative cleanses the stomach, gently sweeps
away all accumulations of undigested food,
and stimulates the liver to assist in relieving
the bowels. By evening the tongue will be
clear again and the overflow of bile swept
away: you will be yourself again, with a
good appetite and digestion. This is the
medicine which does such wonders for chil-
dren of all ages; but it is every bit as good
for grown-up people, and there are full direc-
tions for every age with the bottle. Take
care to buy the genuine, as there are imita-
tions on the market. Ask for “California
Syrup of Figs,” and look for the name and
trade mark of the “California Fig Syrup Co.”
All leading chemists sell “California Syrup of
Figs,” 1/lj and 1/9 per bottle.

Let us pause and admire for a moment
the fine, large-hearted generosity of the
Maoriland Scot. Down Balclutha way
in Otago the local Sandies, who have
been getting Is. 3d. a pound for wool
and 7s. 6d. a bushel for wheat, felt their
hearts so stirred lately by the plight
of Belgium that they decided to do
something en masse and on up-to-date
lines. So they sought out the local M.P.—
one Malcolm, ye ken —and explained to him
that the district had on hand a lot of worn-
out horses which could be boiled down, and
the resultant toothsome, nutritious grub ex-
ported for sale to the liard-up refugees from
Antwerp and Brussels. They also particu-
larly wanted to know how many shares
brother Malcolm could get the Government to
take in the carrion enterprise. The braw
Malcolm, instead of smiting the rapacious
pang with his porringer, solemnly wired par-
ticulars of the project to Premier Massey,
and the heated reply came promptly back
that Massey would see the Clutha bluenoses
in the he at works before he would sanction
the State export brand being affixed to
potted geldings or petrified fillies. Then
Sandy Machaggis and Tonald McFeersun
consumed their brose gloomily ar.d alone, and
repairing to the kirk found solace in a Lug
discoorse on the atonement.
“The Eighteenth” : The arrangements for
the despatch and delivery of letters at the
Liverpool Camp (N.S.W.) are so bad that I
think they are a prize design. A letter from
Sydney—about 20 miles or so from Liverpool
-—bearing Monday’s post-mark, addressed to
Private Mulga Bill, No. 1280.50, 29th Com-
pany, 199t1i Battalion, Liverpool Camp,
might reach him on Wednesday or Thurs-
day, and then again it mightn’t. Maybe only
the part of him that returns from the war
will see that letter, and if none of him comes
back his spirit will have to wait till the
Dead Letters are resurrected. The Depart-
ment has a Postponement Office on the
grounds. Outside is a notice board with a
list of unclaimed letters attached. I saw
my name on the list one day, so inquired
politely (if one doesn’t inquire politely there
may not be anything), and got my letter.
Four days later I had a great desire for
another letter, so went to the notice board
and had the pleasure of seeing, the same old
list, with my name still in the same old place.
I asked the Postponement Master if there
were any letters for me, and was told that
only if my name appeared on the list would
there be for me. I explained that the
list was four days old, and that I had col-
lected the letter referred to; but would he
kindly tell me when a new list would be
made out? I was rather staggered to hear
that the next list would be drawn up when
there were enough letters to justify it! In
some cases this delay means a great deal, as
there are business and professional men in
training at Liverpool who are sacrificing all
they possess to answer the Call; and as leave
| s somewhat restricted they have to trust the
winding up of their affairs to the tender
mercies of this General Bostponement Office.

“Frearson” : Re the howl raised by “Medi-
cus” (B. 25/3/T5) against chemists who
dare to hand out medicine to venereal cases.
To begin with, how many men earning 30s.
or £2 per week are able or .willing to pay a
doctor 1(k (id find thereafter 2s fid or
3s. Cd. weekly "for medicine? To say that
any chemist with a knowledge of venereal
diseases regaids them as Simple is either
childishness or piffle. As for men marrying
whilst still in a condition where contagion is
possible, my personal experience is that
in some cases they deliberately refuse to
notice any advice, and a doctor can no mote
stop them than a chemist. Moreover, the
doctor isn't usually any more disposed to
try. Bringing the* whole thing down to a
fine point, the chemist has a better know-
ledge of the therapeutic action of drugs
than the doctor, and the only point of advan-
tage the latter has is in diagnosis. Where
the symptoms are well defined the chemist is
ts equal every time.

Bdly Blue : To-day (April 8) is the
98th anniversary ot the opening of the Bank
of N. S. Wales at a small cottage m Mac-
quane Place, belonging to Mrs. Mary Beiby.
For -years afterwards the bank observed the
day as a holiday. It was an important epoch in
the history of the. colony this opening of a
bank, and a military guard was put on
sentry duty over the premises night and day.
No person other than the secretary was
a’lowed to enter after sunset or before sun-
rise, unless in company with, or by leave of,
the proper authority. The authorised capi-
tal at that date was £20,000 in 200 shares
of £lOO each ; the subscribed capital, £12,000.
Now the paid-up capital is £3,500,000, and the
reserve fund £2,450,000. The first account
was opened by Jeremiah Murphy, a sergeant
in the 40th Regiment. Jerry lodged £5O.
John Harris, of Ultimo, opened the second
account with £l3B Ik. 4d., and William Red-
fern the third with £5l 15s. 7d. At the end
of the first year the personal balances
amounted to £1859 4s. Bd.; to-day the de-
posits at the bank exceed £37,000.000. The
bank led but a humdrum life fill the first
gold discovery. Then business boomed. In
ISSI the deposits amounted to £382,501; in
1802 they had jumped to £1,367,041 ; by
1853 they were £2,056.257. The profits in
1851 were £22,478. In 1853 they were
£178,196. Since then it has been one long
story of money spinning.

trade with the natives, prepared by C. E. W.

“Extra Master” : Maritime men are mysti-
fled by an advt. appearing in the Common-
wealth Gazette announcing a new, double-
barrelled billet under the Navigation Act —
Principal Ship Surveyor and Examiner of
Masters and Mates. Ship surveying is that
part of surveyor’s work which the engineer-
surveyor does not do. As most present-day
steamships are steel or iron, the ship sur-
veyor’s chief duty is to attend to wooden
clecks and bulkheads, steering gear, anchors
and chains, boats, life-saving appliances and
such. A man might be a pastmaster in all
these matters, and yet not know the first
thing about examining candidates for a second
mate’s ticket, let alone an extra master’s
certificate. Further, the principal examiner
must hold this last certificate himself, and
very few such have qualified as shipwrights,
which every ship surveyor under the Board of
Trade must do. Modern developments have
tended to exalt the examiner of mercantile
marine candidates, and to decry the ship sur-
veyor. The modern extra master wants a
thorough high-class technical and nautical
education. On the other hand, the ship sur-
veyor is essentially a practical man, on whom
“book learning” is mostly wasted. All the
text-books in the world won’t help him to
justly condemn a signal rocket. Therefore
the bracketing of these two branches by the
Federal authorities has caused as much sur-
prise as The Bulletin would if it advertised
for a man to edit the paper and teach boot-
making. The only feasible explanation is
that there is one individual s'omewhere for
whom the job has been made; and that’s not
the sort of thing to be encouraged.
THE NECESSITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The N.S.W. Necessary Commodities Control Com-
mission has decided that beer is a necessity and that
houses, books and soap are not.
We do not need a house at all,
The skies are broad and kind ;
Though suns should burn and rains should fall
We need not greatly mind.
A sheet of bark above us laid
Will turn the drops aside;
A rock or tree will give us shade
Lest we should scorch our hide.
Hence needless soap! Ten thousand years
Our rugged fatheis strode
To tribal battle with their peers
Bearing an earthly loach
Their cheeks were browned with more than sun,
They smote and banged and bashed,
And eheeis for primal battles won
Enthused the brave unwashed.
Books ! Let the ink and paper rot,
Let press and platen rust!
Garvice and Caine we scan them not—
Romance is gilded dust.
Who needs the dull, historic page,
The sage’s pose and bluff,
The crazy poet's rhyming rage?—
We cannot eat the stuff!
Yet though a withered fig-leaf be
Our simple autumn wear ;
Though houseless, bookless, soapless we
Wear gumleaves in our hair;
Yet, needful as our touch or sight,
As nose or mouth or car,
We still must hold the ancient right
To drench our souls in beer.
N.S.W.

PRACTICAL ECONOMY
—Peapes’ Perfected Tailoring: System
Despite the rising costs of woollens the House of Peapes is
producing Distinctive Suits to Measure at prices from
63/- to 84/-
A special workroom, with the most modern equipment, enables
us to counteract the rising costs. Good British Woollens are
used —so good in fact that we are anxious to send patterns so
that comparisons may be made. The cutting and making of
PEAPES’ ECONOMIC SUITS leaves nothing to be
desired, and a very appreciable saving in outlay is effected.
SUITS TO MEASURE, 63/- to 84/-
Early ordering is advised, as present supplies of woollens cannot
be easily duplicated.

“Pulex Irritans”: Surely an enemy has
clone this, thing! One might expect to find
such an item in the Donnerwetterblatter
or the Lokal Lagerspiller, describing the
conditions at Buckingham Palace, but when
the Melbourne press calmly makes the an-
nouncement, it looks as if there had been
dirty work at the cross roads. Here’s the
par.:—
Mr. Justice Ilood, sitting as a judge of the Prize
Court to-day, made an order condemning to the
use of his Majesty the King 30 cases of insect
powder that arrived here by the Norwegian s.s.
ttygja on February 11, consigned to John ILage-
mann, of Liverpool Buildings, Bourke-street.

Many flat-footed Australians are being
barred from joining the brigades which
are being prepared for the Front. A
man with a foot like a sheet of the
S. M. Herald ought to be difficult to
shift once he plants himself fairly on the
soil; but it is explained that he can’t march
to the right soil without jarring his heels.
Surely invention ought to come in here.
Couldn’t the flat-footed hero be put on furni-
ture castors or roller skates or something,
and towed to the right place? On suitable
wheels he •might be counted as a new sort
of artillery, supposing the infantry refused
to treat him as a brother.
EAGER FOR THE RECIPE.
BECK ( despondently): “I said something, my wife didn't like, and she hasn't spoken to
me for two days."
PECK (eagerly): “Can you remember what it was, old man?"
“Y.Z.”: A number of business firms here in
Melbourne are printing what they call scrolls
of fame, and hanging them on the outward
walls. The scroll consists of a gaudy pic-
ture of a swaddy with an expression of great
severity, standing in a defiant attitude, with
his head up against an exploding shell, and
with other evidences of martial ardor all
about him. Then comes the firm's name in
large capitals. Below is a printed list of
the names of those employees who have gone
to the war. It is a noble idea, and is in-
tended to thrill the spectator, and infuse him
with a righteous determination to trade with
the house that has made these heroic sacri-
fices for the Empire. In one instance I wot
of 33 per cent, of the men on the scroll were
participators in a strike that led to their
names being put on the firm’s black-list. But
that, of course, is a thing of the past. Much
may be forgiven to brave fellows willing to
lay down their lives for the firm.
The action seeking to cancel the registra-
tion of the A.W.U. has failed ; but there is
an understanding that the union shall amend
some of its rules before the end of May, when
final judgment wifi be given. The applica-
tion was made on many grounds, but the only
ones that achieved anything approaching
success were those which referred to rules
that seemed more or less up against the
Arbitration principle; and their amendment
will make very little practical difference.
The main grounds for the application rested
on the constitution of the union—it was
alleged that men were admitted to membership
who could not be classed with any of the
sections of employees which the union is sup-
posed to include. About 4UOO people were
objected to; but evidence was given concern-
ing only 300, of whom half were judged to be
misfits. As the worst cases were natur-
ally picked out, and as the A.W.U. has such
a mighty membership, that number didn’t
count for much. As a matter of fact, publi-
cans, storekeepers and others find it good
business to belong to big unions like the
A.W.U., and the Railway Workers, and in
many country pubs the union ticket of
Bung is pasted up so that even the blind
drunk can see it. It acts as a sort of union
label for the beer, even if the beer is bad.
And, generally speaking, the big chiefs of the
A.W.U. have such a poor opinion of beer
that they don’t even pretend to justify the
practice.
4 IIE Bulletin last week received its first
serious complaint from an Australian at the
front. Every other correspondent has been
cheerful in spite of wounds and mud and
delays hr getting a cut at William or Wil-
liam s proxy. This one was bitter. He
hadn t lieaid a decent swear since he had
been in the trenches. Every man he had
come across had sworn more or less, most of
them more; but every swear had been the
same disreputable old swear, one adjective
and one noun, the adjective the most bru-
COMPAPA TIVE PHILOSOPHY.

dividual woman."
tally overworked of the two; and if Kitch-
ener couldn’t introduce some variety to the
business, this Kangaroo wasn’t going to be
held responsible for the consequences.
“Vagabond,” from a hospital in England:
My opinion oi the discussion as to the failure of
black-and-white artists to illustrate war subjects is
that “Y.Z.” (B. 19/11/’l4) is wrong and “H. 0.”
(B. 10/12/’l4) is right. There are plenty good rea-
sons why the camera picture of war shouldn’t agree
with the artist who draws bombs and bayonet charges.
The main one is that the camera men rarely
ventures or is allowed in the sort of rumpus that
brings joy to the heart of a war artist. A certain
Lancer crush did exactly what “Y.Z.” ridicules, i.e.,
“tear madly athwart the landscape in an atmosphere
dotted with explosions.” Moreover, they tore right
in and trod on the enemy’s toes. I don’t recollect
any camera pictures of the incident, but that was
owing to lack of camera and not of incident.
My own particular job has brought me well within
snap-shot of trench-charges, bombs exploding, shells
bursting, and bullets obliterating infantry on the
charge. I’ve been unpleasantly close to magnificent
pictures, but have not a single photo, of one of them,
although / carried in my pocket a small camera,
which was practically never off me night or day.
The plain fact is that during these picturesque inci-
dents I was too busy to think of snapping them or
getting the gear ready. Still I could accurately
describe to an artist, or draw myself if I were artist
enough, the scenes I mention and others similar.
The great weakness of “the blood-and-thunder of
the Caton Woodvilles” is that it is hot one-tenth
bloody or thundery enough to represent the actual
article. Three weeks ago I was in some late German
trenches after they had undergone bombardment by
heavy explosive shells and shrapnel, and after bombs,
hand grenades, machine guns, bayonets and bullets
had exterminated the defence. If “Y.Z.” had seen
that picture of our infantry clambering out of the
trenches, floundering in greasy mud, stumbling
through entanglements, falling and dying or getting
up and running on, and “tearing madly athwart”
the score or two yards between the opposing trenches
in the wake of a few dirty officers, spitting revolvers
in hand, “Y.Z.” would agree with “H. 0.” that this
war provides enough frenzied war-artist picture to
satisfy the greatest glutton. The camera only gets
the big guns at work in peaeeful-looking fashion
because of their carefully-concealed positions. But
it doesn’t get the sort of scene of which I was recently
a highly uncomfortable centre —the middle of a
battery in action and being pelted with big and
little shells at the rate of about 30 a minute.
“Mary McG.” : I am not vindictive, but the
recent crimes of the Ilogman fill me with a
desire to see this war finished in the good
old style adopted by the ancient Assyrians
and practised as late as the days of O.
Cromwell in Ireland. I want to see Europe
emptied of Germans, and the race of Ger-
mans as Germans brought to an end. Of
course the contract would be a large one,
and tolerably expensive, but it would be
worth while if it
saved us from the pos-
sibility of ever having
to meet again in
friendship or war a
race that can muti-
late women and chil-
dren, to jeer at drown-
ing sailors. I hereby
move that a dozen or
two portions of the
earth’s unsettled terri-
tory he allotted to
expatriated Teutons,
and that the German
nation be run through
a race and drafted
into male and female
before exportation :
also that no German
male he permitted to
enter a female Ger-
man settlement or a
German female to set
foot in the country
occupied by German
males. Even the
Kaiser need not he
hanged. The neces-
sity of digging and
planting potatoes and
pigs and things to
sustain life would im-
pose quite sufficient
hardship upon him.
As for any sentimental
regard for family feel-
ing or attachment to
the soil of their father-
land, these things
surely need not be
considered in connec-
tion with the race that
lighted bonfires of re-
joicing over the ruin
of Belgian homes and
fired on defenceless
children along the Yorkshire coast.
Germany, having thus been cleaned no,
could be cut into desirable leaseholds
and offered to patriarchs desirous of
founding new nations, on the condi-
tion that any new nation found with a gun in
its hand should immediately be sent to what
was left of the nearest German settlement.
Nebuchadnezzar would have understood a
scheme like that, and Assur-bani-pal would
have carried it through.
* • * * *
“Wealsman” : I have lately seen a number
of picture-postcards of groups of German
sailors photoed on board their warships,
mostly commemorative of welcomes, farewells
and similar social functions. There is usu-
ally a blackboard in the forefront of the
photo, with particulars of the function
chalked thereon. An outstanding feature
of these inscriptions is the truculent
embellishment thereof. The favorite sign
appears to be a flash of spear-lightning. Sev-
eral German group-photos found on the
wreck of the Emden fairly bristle with that
vicious looking implement. Is the brandish-
ing of such threatening weapons (on post-
cards) a disease common among the naval
warriors of other nations? Or is it a purely
German throw-back to the savage who
sought to paralyse his enemies with fear by
painting himself to resemble a skeleton or
the Devil?
The new Harbors Board of S. Australia
is strongly suspected of sarcasm by the
Town Council of Brighton, an Adelaide sea-
side suburb. Its little old jetty, in the
shallow waters of the Gulf, will not take
anything but small boats at low tide, and
an extension to a depth that will accommo-
date small steamers was asked for. The
Harbors Board did some exploring, and
then remarked courteously: (1) To get
10ft. at low-water would mean extending
over 300 yards at “very great” cost; (2)
for £2OOO the jetty could be extended 200
feet, but “the soundings show that the
depth of water at that distance is one foot
shallower than at the present head of the
jetty.” After which “the Board would be
glad to know if the Council has any sug-
gestions to offer.” Naturally, beyond'guess-
ing that its grandfathers had built in the
wrong place, it had none. A mile or two
away are Marino rocks, off which is deep
water; but the gradually sloping sands that
make the fortune of a seaside resort are
about the worst possible place for jetty-
building, if you want the jetty to serve also
as a boat-pier.
THE FOREIGN LEGION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They must not tread on the soil of France,
Or the land of their hot, wild youth long
vanished ;
They have no share in the world’s romance,
They only live with the banned and banished.
Their ranks are filled with the world-wide scamps,
From the Melbourne crook to the fair Norwegian—
From the. Golden Gate to the Cossack camps,
They send recruits to the Foreign Legion.
They are only known to a mother's heart,
With a weight of years and sorrow on her ;
She only knows he will play his part
With a brave boy's grit and a black sheep’s honor.
She wonders where he is fighting now
(As the friends of the Legion often .wondered),
For the world and France, and a name disgraced
And lost to him when his hot youth blundered!
Somewhere down, I think, by the Suez banks,
In the burning sand of that torrid region,
She could surely find in the Allies’ ranks
Her well-loved scamp of the Foreign Legion!

PERSONAL
ITEMS
South Aus. has a remarkable new recruit
to the farming industry in a son of Josiah
Syrnon, K.C. He first studied law at Ox-
ford, then came home and went through the
Roseworthy College agricultural course,
carrying off cups and medals in the process.
Angas Parsons, the recent Attorney-General
of S.A., took things the reverse way—-Rose-
worthy first and law afterwards.
THE PATRIOT.
H E: “In a time like this one must not allow
personal considerations to obstruct the cause
of Emptah, don't you know?"
THE GIRL: “How splendid! You going?”
HE: “ Well, no; but I’ve given my chauffeur

Alfred Deakin, to an artist for whom he
was sitting a short time previous to his
departure to America: “You must let me

tion.”
Frank Suttor, President of the N.S.W.
Peg. Council since 1908, for 40 years con-
nected with politics and sheep, and in his
later days a knight, went to the last divi-
sion on Sunday. He was 75 when the bell
rang. He had occupied a seat in one House
or another of Parliament since 1875, follow-
-11*» hi s father, a member of the Legislature
of 1840, when Victoria and Queensland
formed part of N.S.W.. as the representa-
tive of Bathurst. A grandson of that
George Suttor whom Banks induced to settle
in Australia 115 years ago, Francis Suttor
was a member of several N.S.W. Govern-
ments, and was one of the first of the old
brigade to advocate a policy of Protection
for the infant State. For this he earned
the bitter hostility of Parkes, who had giv.n
him his. first portfolio. Of a jovial and
kindly disposition the old man was one of
the most popular citizens of the Ma State.
His big heart went wrong at the last, and
the argument with Death w r as only a matter
of tw’o or three days.
THE AFTER-PAINS.
The Kaiser has sent a message to the New York
World through its Berlin correspondent. “I did not
want this awful warr." he states. “My greatest
desire was to end my life without a German war.
Other nations brought on the conflict. — Cable.

They made me eat it! I always hated

Whitmore Carr —knowm to all his friends
as "Doc.” —has been elected president of the
Adelaide Stock Exchange for the 12th time.
Before he went in seriously for sharebroking
he was the Register’s sporting editor, and
nowadays is chairman of the A.R.C.
“Onoto” (San Francisco) : Two Austra-
lians who have won their spurs at the
Panama-Pacific Exposition are artist A.
Llewellyn Brindle, of Melbourne, and archi-
tect 11. E. Dakin, of Sydney.
To the order of the Australian
Commissioners, Brindle has exe-
cuted half a dozen water-color
panels, each 20ft. x sft., depict-
ing Australian methods of dairy-
ing, mining, wool-carting, wheat-
stacking, horse-breeding and
cattle-droving. These are showm
as a frieze in the Commonwealth
Pavilion. The boldness of his
brush work and the originality
of his color schemes have
brought local recognition in
the form of outside commis-
sions. He is now working
overtime for the U.S. Automo-
bile Association on five 24ft.
x 9ft. landscape panels illus-
trating motor highways in
American tourist resorts, as a
central mural feature of the
Palace of Transportation.
Dakin, who returns to Sydney
this year, confines himself to
tlie interior decoration of the Maoriland
pavilion, for which he is entirely responsible.
The work is effectively carried out in Corin-
thian style, chiefly of M.L. timbers.
At Kilmore (Vic.) John Hann, who said
he was 92 and looked a hundred, recently
sued a grazier for £3l for work done. In
evidence it was stated that whenever he
went to a job the old chap carried along his
coffin, and refused to stop unless the shell
was accommodated also. He had had it
made years ago. he told the Bench, and he
reckoned he would have a chance of using
it yet.
The late T. A. Browne (“Rolf Boldre-
wood”) was the first to sell cuts of beef to the
diggers on Ballarat. He was en route from
his station, Squattlesea Mere, via Geelong,
with a mob of fat cattle for Melbourne mar-
ket. Hearing of the gold find and the rush he
changed his mind, and decided for Ballarat.
In Geelong he bought meat-hooks, a saw,
block and tackle, etc., in case he should have
to start butchering on his own account. He
had with him an Englishman who called him-
self Mark Tapley, and a blackboy. The
sheep butchers on the ground made a “ring,”
and decided upon giving only a certain figure
for the cattle; but he borrowed a gun, shot
a bullock, and sold the joints, steaks and
prime pieces. He did a roaring trade.
After a few days Mr. Bath, afterwards of
Bath’s Hotel, made Browne a good offer for
his “shop,” fittings and bullocks. Browne
closed with the offer, and quitted butchering.
A somewhat similar first experience was that
of pioneer Arthur Hodgson, of Darling
Downs, who carried his legs of mutton on a
tray in Brisbane streets, and sold them at
a shilling each.
Old Baron Rothschild has died in London
after a surgical operation. He was pro-
bably killed by the war, for the family is
closely identified with European finance and
is to a large extent bound up with Austria.
This one, Nathan, was a Baron of the Aus-
trian Empire and a grandson of that Nathan
Rothschild who, getting in on the early
doors at London Stock Exchange after
Waterloo, bagged a million or so before
anyone else knew what had happened. He
succeeded to the title of uncle Anthony, but
got a peerage on his own account in 1880,
and, like most of the house, obeyed the in-
junctions of the old pawnbroker of Frank-
fort, who backed the p.n.’s of the Landgrave
of Hesse, and chose another Rothschild (a
German) for wife. Most of the money has
remained in the family, though Hannah, a
daughter of Meyer, carried a swagful to the
altar with Rosebery. Nathan’s baronetcy
goes to Lionel, who in his spare time of
recent years has sat as a member of the
House of Commons (Tory), raced some of
the best horses in England, and had scouts
all over the world gathering butterflies. Ilis
collection of New Guinea and South Sea
Island insects, made by A. S. Meek, is
easily the best in the world. A younger
brother’s specialty is fleas. The Roths-
child’s principal haunt is the Vale of Ayles-
bury, once the home of a thriving yeomanry
and the birthplace of many famous soldiers
and sailors ; but nearly all the old villages
have been swept away and financiers and
pheasants are bred there now.
Brigadier-General Owens, who was given
command of the Australian artillery a while

After really hard work for three years,
the Adelaide committee has got together the
£7OO needed for a statue of Sturt, the ex-
plorer. Adrian Jones, who did the striking
soldier-on-horseback by S. Aus. Government
House gates, is to have the commission, and
gets various hints as to costume from the
explorer’s daughter, who still, at a great
age, lives in England. The site is to be by
the G.P.0., right opposite McDouall Stuart,
who was another of the same plucky pion-
eering tribe.
The Law in N. S. Wales has laid its hand
on its principal witness in the Eveleigh rob-
bery case, and she goes to gaol for five years
for perjury. Kate Lee was years older than
the boastful Ryan whom she helped to dissi-
pate the fine haul of cash which should have
paid the railway workshops’ men’s wages;
but she was not too old to play Delilah to
Ryan’s poor Samson. For this she was for-
given many sins; but during the trial of
another of the Eveleigh men, Freeman, on a
charge of shooting with intent to murder, she
presumed too much, and went up for perjury.
Her sentence is the heaviest passed upon a
woman in Sydney for many years for any-
thing short of murder.
More about the father of a trade: —
Turned the last page, Charles Walch, bookseller,
head of the firm of J. Walch and Sons, of Tasmania,
a notable figure and for many years the oldest repre-
sentative of the trade in Australia. He was 84 when
he died, a frail old man, kept going through the
last years by indomitable will, but still mentally
alert and ready to thrust with vigorous and war-
like pen at any infringement of public interest. Keen
as his interest was in the welfare of the country, he
took no overt part in public affairs, and set most
store by his position of Sunday-school superinten-
dent. One of his brothers, the late Garnet Walch,
who wasn’t a Sunday-school superintendent, was well
known in Australian writing circles a couple of
decades ago. The Walch firm dates back to 1846,
when Major .1. W. H. Walch bought the business
from Samuel Tegg, who, six years previously, had
opened shop in the one-time White Horse Inn.
Returning to Tasmania from the Vic. goldfields on
the death of his father in ’52, young Charles Walch
went into partnership with his brother James, and
was sent to England to buy for the firm. Buying
was more difficult than selling at the time, for money
was plentiful and anything would “go.” Stuff was
sent out to Tasmania made up in lots ready for sale
by auction, and tradespeople went to the wharves
and bought eagerly in advance of published prices.
In his book of memoirs Walch tells of his early diffi-
culties in London—an unknown youth, dressed in a
manner “partly nautical and wholly colonial,” and
representing an unknown firm somewhere at the
Antipodes. A distant cousin, a Mincing Lane broker,
whom he asked for advice, said: “Go and see a
good tailor,” and the tailor and the cash basis on
which business was conducted helped to carry
things through. Then the Crimean War disorgan-
ised the Australian mail service, the British Govern-
ment needing every available steamer to get muni-
tions through to the Crimea, and mails had to wander
round the world in a sailing ship. Next year the
service was more regular, but freights totalled about
£2O a ton by the time goods were landed in Hobart,
owing to frequent transhipment and the carriage by
camel to Suez. By ’5B all was going well, and the
firm being established, Charles Walch returned to
Tasmania to command universal respect for more
than half a century.
AND WAR’S A GAME OF CHESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is now
attached to the staff close to the Front, and is busy
morning and night. lie is in the pink of condition,
and is perfectly happy because he feels that he is
-haring the actual life of the soldiers.
-—London Times.
The Prince of Wales is near the Front;
He’s busy night and morn;
He bears in mind the battle’s brunt,
And laughs the foe to scorn.
About his prowess and his nerve
The Times tells stirring tales,
And cynics! reading them, observe:
“Yes, very like a Wales!”
How “pink” and happy Edward seems ;
He dines with Marshal French,
But pots the Germans in his dreams—-
They’re crouching in a trench.
The glow of health, without a doubt,
Is on his youthful face ;
The Prince, in fact, has started out
To win the British race.
One sort of soldier’s life he shares—
Ah ! there are many lives,
And some are taken unawares
From mothers, sisters, wives;
And some are blighted ere they bloom ;
Nobodies lose their limbs.
But they are not the lives for whom
We sing our loyal hymns.
Fair Heir-Apparent to the Sov.,
I wish thy lot were mine!
I’d love to be a member of
The royal fighting line.
With fortitude could I endure
The buffets fate might bring ;
From shot and shell God’s pretty sure
To save Our Future King.
Well, war is as a game of chess,
Where pawns the King protect;
Knights, castles, bishops more or less
Maintain his rank and sect;
Him knights revere, and bishops bless,
And women all would fain caress—
Yea, pulpit, petticoat and press
Pay homage and respect.
And in all games, or slow or brisk,
The rules we must obey;
And some have got to take the risk
Whilst some for safety play.
VICTORIA.

This is one of the most unsatisfactory bal:
ance-sheets published in Australia, and the
directors responsible for it ought to be sen-
tenced to sit for a month on the broken
glass bottles which guard the tops of the
walls of the Adelaide gaol. The co.’s assets
total £633,724, and of this amount no less
than £490,041 is said to be in “freehold and
leasehold properties, machinery, plant, roll-
ing stock, goodwill, etc.” Goodwill is the
froth on the pot, and the Brewing Co. at
least knows that a pub which persistently
charged fourpence a pint for froth would
soon have no customers to charge for any-
thing. The plain fact of the matter is that
the co. may be hopelessly insolvent so far
as these accounts indicate to the contrary.
Liabilities amount to just over £240.000;
and apart from the composite item mentioned
above, and which may be nineteen-twentieths
goodwill for all the published statement
shows, there are only £143,683 of assets.
The few insiders know the exact position
as regards assets —know how much is beer
and how much is froth. The man who
doesn’t know more than the published
accounts tell him doesn’t know enough to
play any game wherein these shares are
counters.
The improvement in the published figures
during the past few years has certainly been
astonishing. For the three years 1903-4-5
the average gross annual profit on trade, was
£25,092; for the past three years the fairly
uniform figures have made an average of
£75,457. No capital has been got in during the
past 10 years, and no great changes have
occurred in S. Aus. There have been no
important mining developments, and what
political developments there have been have
been more hostile to the co. than otherwise.
Yet, with practically the same plant, etc.,
and with practically the same markets, the
co. shows that in 10 years gross profits have
moved from £25,092 to £75,457. During
the period A. E. Nott, formerly the
Broken Hill manager, and afterwards the
secretary, became general manager; but if
he is responsible for even half such an im-
provement he is a Better Nott than even
Wallington, guide of Governors, used to be.
Allowing that there has been a great im-
provement in the position of the co., the
change in the figures is so astonishing that
the accounts refuse to look as serious as
accounts should.
As for the future, S. Aus. has just said
that pubs should close at 6 o’clock ; and the
question is What is that going to do for a
co. which is not only the biggest brewer but
also the biggest wine and spirit merchant
in the State? And also, by the way, a big
landlord of pubs; rents (no doubt mostly for
hotels) average about £16,000 a year. As
the owner of pubs the co. must suffer; as a
wholesale supplier it will also suffer in the
draught beer trade; but it will probably
make a bit more as a wholesale dealer in
bottled goods. It is a remarkable thing that
the co. has been piling on profits during the
past few years in the face of decreasing pubs,
for there has been wholesale delicensing in
S. Aus. From that it is argued that the
co. may further fatten on further kicks. For
its own part The Bulletin has no confi-
dence in such anomalies. The changes which
are being made are likely to do the co.
much more harm than good.

The accounts of the Ordinary Department
have already been post-mortemed. The
Citizens’ was formed by shareholders, and
the profits (if any) in this Industrial
Department belong to. them. That is to
say, the shareholders issue a policy which
is a. definite contract to pay a certain amount
when the policy-holder dies or reaches a
specified age. If the co. works at a low
expense rate, or has unusually favorable
death experience (in other words, if people
don’t die who ought to, according to the
actuaries’ figures), or if the investments
bring in more interest than had been reck-
oned upon, the co. is that much to the
good. If, on the other hand, war or other
curse kills people before their time and the
bargain is a bad one for the co., the latter
must still pay up the full amount of the
policy, the deficiency being made good out
of the shareholders’ capital. The latter at
present amounts to £108,225 paid up; but,
since almost anything may happen to an
insurance office in the world’s greatest war,
this amount is being increased, and by the
end of the year there will be at least
£200,000 paid up and guaranteeing to policy-
holders the full face value of their policies
plus _ bonus additions in the case of those
policies which carry profits.
The constitution of the co. explains the
mention of dividends at the head of one of
the columns in the table. If all payments
made to persons other than policy-holders
are reckoned as expenses, the expense rate
last year was 41.7 p.c. Even including the
payments made to shareholders the rate is
therefore much under the Industrial insur-
ance average. It is of course nothing to
be jubilant over. There is nothing glorious
about an insurance system under which
rather less than 12s. in the £ paid in pre-
miums is available for actual insurance, the
other Bs. being absorbed by exes. Yet even
this is enormously better than the common
experience of a few years ago. And it is
unquestionably better that a family should
have insurance on these terms than on no
terms at all. The trouble is that Industrial
insurance catches only those people who,
through improvidence or other defect, or
misfortune, cannot or will not save up
enough to pay a quarterly premium on an
Ordinary policy. They have to be pursued
fortnightly for their few coppers, and that
means expense, and what goes in expense
can’t also be available for insurance.

This is one of the cos. in the Combine, and
practically all its assets consist of shares in
that concern. And that is a point which
must not be overlooked. Sometimes com-
bines and horrible understandings and such
like fall to pieces, and then there is worse
trouble than ever. But the Beer Combine in
Melbourne can’t fall to pieces and start to
fight with itself. Officially it is the Carlton
and United _ Breweries Co., and when it
was formed it took over all the plant of all
the cos. that it thought worth having. It
also leased what brewery properties it
thought it wanted. The plant which wasn’t
taken over has mostly been broken up. This
Foster Co.’s outfit was at first required.
When more economical arrangements were
made the C. and U.B. paid this co. £BOOO
to cry off. The property, being thus thrown
back on this co.’s hands, was sold—at so
much less than book value that a large sum
had to be written off. as shown in the table.
All that this co. now owns is its shares in
the Combine (£76,125) and a few etceteras
—deposits, balances on property sold, and
the like —totalling £9074. Its liabilities
amount to £1472. Against its capital of
£57,600 it has thus £76.125 of Combine
shares and £7602 net of other assets. The
Combine shares are largely froth—the
tangible assets don’t represent anything like
the full amount of the capital—but the profit
is all right. And, after all, that is just about
all you can expect from a brewery
co.; for even if it shows you that
it has three-fourths of its capital in
premises and plant and hotels you
can be pretty certain that, if the Trade came
to grief and the assets had to be realised, on
liquidation they wouldn’t fetch more than
perhaps half of the book value, though book
value may have been under cost. The
Foster’s holding of Combine shares being
much in excess of its own capital, and its
own exes, being very small —only £172 last
half-year—the Combine’s 8 p.c. allows the
Foster to pay a trifle more than 8 p.c. For
the past half-year a bonus at the rate of 2
p.c. has been added. Things will go on like
that while the Combine holds the trade ; and
so far it isn’t seriously threatened by com-
petition. But there are clouds in the poli-
tical sky. The old-style wowser was an ass
who tried to abolish Beer in one act. The
Trade’s modern enemy, well represented in
8. Aus.. knows better: he recognises that
the public is practically always prepared
to tie Bung up a little tighter, and the
over-fat person is being choked to death by
inches.

That looks like business. And the size of
the dividends in proportion to the profits
looks like prudence. Still, prudence isn’t a new
plant on this co.’s premises. For instance,
the articles don’t leave it to future directors
to decide whether or not goodwill and other
intangible assets shall be written down;
they say that until all the capital is repre-
sented by solid assets at least 10 p.c. of the
profits shall be put by. As a matter of fact,
the directors are doing much better than
that, with the result that in two years
nearly £13.000. or just upon 50 p.c. of the
profits, has been saved up. And it isn’t a
mythical saving-up either. Look at these
figures:—

Another testimonial to cash trading! Though
the turnover must now be very fine and
large the co. lias only £3499 on its books —
which means practically no bad debts to
provide for, while the heavy expenses of col-
lection are saved and, having the cash to pay
for its own purchases, the co. can take all
the trade discounts that are offering without
going to its banker for help. It no doubt
gives customers some of the benefit of all
this; but it would be an extraordinary co. if
it didn’t pocket a little alsp for itself. Any-
way, here are the facts: without getting in a
penny more capital the co. has in three years
added £lO,OOO to its stock and £2OOO to its
cash, besides paying off £4OOO of liabilities ;
and a co. which can do that on a capital of
£70,000 and pay a dividend of 8 p.c. (put up
to 10 p.c. for the past half-year) can be
pretty safely said to have not only the best
sort of connection, but also the best sort of
management.

In seven years this co., besides paying its 10
p.c. dividend, has added £55,316 to its re-
serves, £51,316 coming from surplus profits
and £4OOO from premiums on a new share
issue. In addition, large sums were written
off a few years ago ; but probably some of
that was restored when in 1912 £21,000
which had been set aside for contingencies
was transferred to reserves, the contingencies
having evidently obliged by not turning up.
At any rate, there is the comfortable fact
that in five years enough profit has been
added to reserves to pay an average divi-
dend of over 8 p.c., in addition to the 10
p.c. which has been paid. The 10 p.c. has
actually called for £59,500, and the profits
beyond that have been £51,316, after provid-
ing for the depreciation reckoned necessary.
But it is rather important to know how
undivided profit is represented. Many a
mining co., for example, shows (say)
£15,000 profit; but if you asked to be shown
the golden sovereigns you would be told:
“Oh, we haven’t got them. We made the
money, but we’ve spent it again in sinking
a shaft.” Also, there was once a co. of man-
ufacturing stationers and printers which
made profits; and when shareholders asked
where the very desirable things were, they
were told, “Oh, we’ve put them into stock.”
Part of the stock consisted of cases upon
cases called “stationery” in the stock-sheets ;
and when an inquisitive man one day thought
he would like some better description of
the goods and ripped the covers off, he found
thousands and thousands of Somebody’s trade
pamphlets, printed and for some reason un-
delivered 10 years or more ago, and utterly
valueless, of course. When that stock was
written down to the extent represented by
the valueless “stationery,” that co.’s profit
was gone altogether. So, as The Bulletin
said just now, before it wandered on to cer-
tain cases of stationery with which Wright,
Heaton and Co. have nothing whatever to
do, it is interesting to know, not merely that
there has been a profit, but what has become
of it.
In probing into that question in Wright,
Heaton’s case, this comparison may help:—

In the six years £lO,OOO of capital has been
got in. plus £4OOO of premiums. The co.
has added £15,414 of debt, and has accumu-
lated £14,089 of cash. Roundly speaking,
the additions to the debt are about repre-
sented by extra cash and net value added to
plant; the £lO,OOO of new capital is repre-
sented by additions to stock ; and the surplus
profit, including the premiums on new shares,
is represented by £34,852 more book debts
and £15,139 more invested in the McCulloch
Carrying Co. —a Victorian concern which
belongs to this co. The quality of the re-
serves therefore depends very largely upon
the book debts. Most of the clients are, no
doubt, squatters and cockies —gentlemen who
sometimes have a bad habit of reckoning
that cash means payment any time within a
couple of years, but who are as good marks
as any as long as you don’t rush them with
a demand to pay 15 bushels of debt with the
proceeds of a 5-bushel harvest.

As usual in Maoriland this co. is heavily
in debt. The M.L. farmer, as a rule, starts
off with little, and finds a co. to finance him ;
and the co. which finances him has to find
somebody to finance it. This shows more
of the innards of the concern:-
1911. 1914. 1915.

Liabilities . . . . 72,872 84,211 92,103

Stock 5,092 13,081 17,469
Cash 231 103 406
During the year some pref. capital was got
in; but that didn't reduce the liabilities—
it simply encouraged the co. to extend its
operations and finance more farmers. And old
customers probably needed a bit more help,
too, because the past year has been the
droughtiest known in the Waikato —the
most progressive agricultural district of the
North Island —for the last 30 years. Of
the liabilities no less than £48,272 is owing-
on current account; the balance is made up
mainly of fixed deposits and overdraft.
With such a miserable holding of cash, this
looks like pretty dangerous financing. It
is all right, no doubt, so long as the bank
is affable ; but the trouble is that at the very
moment when depositors would want to
draw their money out and it would be most
difficult to get money in, the bank could
least afford to be affable. The right policy
is to keep a tight rein on both dividends
and bonuses (the latter at present are too
generous) and strengthen the position by
more rapid accumulation of reserves.
Dr. Wade, talking about S. Australian oil
possibilities, says. that even as to the south-
east his reservation that petroleum may be
found there is “based on surmise and
no evidence.” The occasional presence
of asphaltum, he argues, shows merely
that petroleum has been there or there-
abouts in some past age, and some
found on the coast came from beds now
covered by the sea. His chief contempt is
reserved for those who say: “This looks like
such-and-such oil-bearing country elsewhere.”
“Such superficial comparisons are quite
valueless, and should be disregarded.” But
Wade can’t dismiss a man like T. J. Whaley
in that way. Whaley was born in oil and grew
up in. oil, and has never thought or talked
anything but oil. He has managed important
oil wells and refineries for some of the big-
gest people in the U.S.A. He didn’t come
to Australia looking for a job to boss a drill-
ing crew. He simply said, looking at a
map, that a continent as big as Australia
ought to give the best chances offering of a
new oilfield, and he spent his own money to
come and give six months to a look-round.
He examined the evidence available from each
State, and fixed on the south-east of S. Aus.
as offering not only the best chances, but in
his opinion exceptional chances. lie didn’t
go on to the Stock Exchange and make a
noise; he has persistently shooed off re-
porters : he and three or four friends simoly
and quietly sent to the U.S.A. for a boring
plant, spending their own money, and if they
don’t strike oil in the first hole they think
well enough of their chances to drill another.
#■ -x- * *
Dr. Wade writes to The Bulletin, re
its brief comment on his report, that his
examination of S. Australia for oil was
made in the same manner as that of Papua
—“most of our time in S. Australia was
spent in making geological surveys just as
in the Possession.” He adds that the
Bulletin statement, to the effect that there
are only two geological maps of S. Aus. —
both of small northern areas —is wrong; but
he throws no further light on that point.

With the amalgamation of all the coal-
mining unions of the Commonwealth into
one big federation, John Brown will have
something sizable to argue with. The new
organisation—the Australasian Coal and
Shale Employees’ Association —says it aims
at —
The improvement of the conditions and protection
of the members of the federation, by increasing the
proportionate share of wealth to the workers, and
endeavoring to educate for the complete abolition of
the present wage system and the substitution of
common ownership of the means of production.
So far all the unions in the Eastern States
and Tasmania are represented, and the
machine intends reaching out its long arm
shortly to try to drag in W.A. and Maori-
land.

New Life for Croydon Goldfield. —Deep-sinking
project. The Queensland Government has granted a
subsidy of £16,666/13/4 to Mr. F. W. Cuthbert, of
Croydon, towards the cost of sinking a deep shaft on
the Iguana Reef, Croydon Goldfield, on condition
that Mr. Cuthbert spends half that amount in addi-
tion. Mr. Cuthbert, who has had 28 years’ experi-
ence of mining on the Croydon field, and has struck
it rich more than once, is floating a company to take
up the concession, and Messrs. Charlton & Elliott and
Messrs. Corrie & Co., Brisbane, are now receiving
applications for shares for what may prove to be
the biggest mining proposition in the North for many
yeai's. The capital of the company is £lO,OOO, in
40,000 shares of ss. each. The whole of the money
subscribed goes to the credit of the company, and
there are no paid-up or promoters’ shares; all the
shares being contributing. The Iguana Reef at
shallow' levels produced gold to the value of
£233,658, and the late Air. Rands, one of our
greatest geological authorities, frequently expressed
the opinion that still more profitable ground w'ould
be picked up on the same reef at deeper levels. A
diamond drill bore has been sunk and has located
gold-bearing reef formation at 1219 feet, which sup-
ports Mr. Rand’s opinion, and it is alongside this
bore-hole that the shaft is to be sunk. It is in the
expectation of finding this opinion and evidence
further confirmed, by striking a good, payable, gold-
bearing reef, that the Government has granted the
subsidy, and Mr. Cuthbert is devotine- his energies to
forming a company. Charters Towers sprang into
new life and produced gold beyond the most extrava-
gant dreams of the shallow workers when the deep
levels were struck. There are great hopes that Croy-
don will orove a second, perhaps greater, Charters
Towers, both fields being situated in granite country
and having many strong features in common. The
names of Sir Robert Philp, Messrs. E. H. Macartney,
H. A. C. Douglas, G. L. Hourston and F. W. Cuthbert
as provisional directors are guarantees that the
management will be efficient. Mr. Cuthbert will be
managing director, with residence in Croydon.*

Ninety-nine out of every 100 of these finds
will be "squibs.” but if there s a hun-
dredth fairly permanent show, it will be
something solid to the good. Nothing like
a paying mine to give a lot of employ ment
quickly. # #
In Australia the manufacture of sul-
phuric acid and superphosphate has made
rapid strides; and a country that is con-
tinually urged to grow more wheat and feed
more stock is certain to require moie
“super,” and incidentally 7 more acid. It
was the use of chemical fertilisers in the
U.S.A. that so enormously increased the de-
mand for sulphuric acid, until at the pre-
sent time from three to four million tons of
sulphuric are manufactured in 12 months. On
the latest figures 2,839,300 tons are made
from pyrites, 292,748 tons from zinc ore,
about 270.000 tons from copper ore,
and a relatively small quantity from brim-
stone. The total U.S.A. production of acid
in 1912 was 3,402,108 tons. Compared with
this the Australian trade is a mere baby.
The Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A.) is reck-
oned a large producer; yet it turned out
only 5940 tons of sulphuric last year. The
B. H. Prop, produces a few thousand tons a
year, and several fertiliser and chemical
works produce acid of various degrees of
strength. The cost of production at Wal-
laroo is 17s. llld. per ton, and the selling
price to fertiliser works ranges from 255. to
30s.
A Sydney co., guided in technical matters
by H. Rowley, a chemist and engineer well
known in Tasmania and the West, is getting
to work on the blackboy and zamia palm—
two of the best-known and most common of
Westralia’s native vegetables. You can cut
either of them by the thousand ton;
and the Westralian Parliament has passed
a Bill granting the co. the right to do its
cutting on Crown lands, paying a very
small royalty on the crop. The pith of the
butt of the zamia palm is mostly starch;
and the co. proposes to extract that article,
and gradually work it into by-products, of
which Rowley 7 has produced a score. From
the blackboy a vegetable tar of very high
pitch value is first produced ; and from that
again a dozen by-products are possible. For
the present, however, the co. will confine
itself to varnishes and lacquers. It can
find a good local market for all the tar it
can produce for some time to come. Thus
far, in fact, tar is the only article the co.
has turned to commercial account; but
more extensive plant will materialise before
long, and the co. will then be on the
market against various foreign goods which
formerly were very largely supplied by 7 Ger-
many. Everything except cost of produc-
tion has been proved. The products have
been tested, and they are of very high
quality. Now it is a matter of d°monstrat-
ing things on a commercial scale. As a
pioneer not of one but of many new indus-
tries the co. at any rate deserves all the
help patriotic Australians can give it.

Mount David (N.S.W.) is getting near
the fateful hour when it will have to get a
move on or chuck it. A very sleepy and
dejected centre of population will about
fall off the map if the mine doesn’t start
again. The probability is that a bit more
work will be done. Mount David has been
too good a friend to market-gamblers to be
allowed to expire altogether, if there is any
gratitude in this world. Anyway, the
recently-reported finding of the main reef
looks promising at the present critical stage.
Even if it isn’t found, something else may
be by the couple of men recently put on,
if they keep on looking conscientiously and
are favored by luck. When it comes to
treatment, however, a fair bit of cash will
have to be spent in fixing plant up again.
Things about the battery do not altogether
represent the pink of perfection.

Mount Baring, formerly Dad’s Millions,
Oberon (N.S.W.), has again lapsed into its
chronic habit and shut down. This, how-
ever, has happened so frequently that the
local populace shows no signs of surprise.
Judging by previous performances, the pro-
perty, though by no means a non-starter,
can hardly be classed among the stayers;
but the present owner at least got as far
as a clean up, which is more than some of
its proud proprietors did.

White Crystal, Ardletlian (N.S.W.),
claims to have assets above liabilities amount-
ing to £11,482. During the past 12 months
the co. has spent £16,396. made up of £2349
on hand a year ago, £13.787 calls, £164
from forfeited shares sold, and an overdraft
of £96 at the close of the term. Plant cost
£5700. wages and contracts ran into £5724,
timber, etc., £2559, and some land was
bought for £749. Concentrates are valued
at £2OOO. All that looks quite nice. But
there’s this sting in the tail of the pretty 7
thing—the yield from 491 tons first crushed
?ave only 20 tons of tin oxide. That’s why,
when you mention White Crystal to a Bal-
larat shareholder nowadays, he immediately
thinks of arsenic or cyanide or strychnine.
Croydon (N.Q.) is battling for its life. It
can get a State subsidy of £16,666 towards
sinking a deep shaft on the Iguana line of
reef if it puts up £8333 itself ; and it is chasing
that money hard. After years of depression,
due to the working out of the shallow de-
posits, the field isn’t flush ; so it is calling
south for help. From the shallow levels of
the Iguana reef £233,658 worth of gold has
been won ; and from the deep levels Croydon
thinks it ought to repeat the history of
Charters Towers: —
The field broke out in 1872 and prospered for
some years. By 1884 the shallow levels had been
cleaned of their gold. Miners left. The town lan-
guished ; but suddenly gold was discovered at deeper
levels. The Towers began a new and remarkably
profitable life. Where the old shallow ground had
yielded a thousand ounces, the deep levels yielded
five thousand —and that is 30 years ago. In that
time over twenty-three million pounds’ worth of
gold has been won —practically all of it after the
shallow workers had abandoned the field.
F. W. Cuthbert is managing director and
nominally the promoter of the eo. But he is
the sort of promoter who “does not ask any
fee nor paid-up shares,” but “Will come in
as an ordinary contributing shareholder on
exactly the same footing as all other sub-
scribers.” This is a case where The
Bulletin hopes God will help one who
doesn’t help himself.
Black Range (W.A.) proposes to blot
itself out by handing itself over lock, stock,
barrel and cartridges to the Black Range
Pinnacles Co. The Black Range Co.,
although at the end of its tether, holds assets
worth about £12,248; and these, together
with some liabilities, will be passed over
for 72,500 £1 shares paid up to 55., or say
£18,125 worth of scrip. Besides this, the
owners of the option over the Pinnacles
group will take £5060 cash and £4OOO in
paid-up £1 shares, as well as £3500 in shares
to be paid to Hans Irvine for his options
over the leases. These latter payments tot
up £12,500, and represent, with the shares
allotted to the moribund Black Range Co.,
80,000 shares out of the 60,000 in the new
co. It seems to be a fair deal for both
parties, if the Pinnacles leases be as good
as Manager Tom Couper thinks they are.
Shareholders in the Black Range will
receive share for share now held by them.
Ivulamadau, Woodlark Island (Papua),
has had another disappointing half-year.
Disappointing in two ways. A while ago
it looked as though the mine would at last
pass into the hands of a co. with enough
capital and technical skill to give it a fair
chance; but, after examination. Broken Hill
Block 10, which had the option, turned it
down. In the second place, though 6592
tons of stone were crushed, not enough
profit was made to provide for depreciation
of plant. The working account was £421
to the good ; but 5 p.c. for wear and tear
required £623. Things might have been a
bit better had more cyaniding been done;
only 1350 tons were handled, and as a trifle
was spent in altering that plant it showed
a loss. Perhaps it would have shown a
loss anyway. Mining (6967 tons) cost
£7022, which is on the high side, and milling
(6592 tons) cost £2471, which was a great
deal too much. Very little work seems to
have been done at Nos. 4 and 5 north. Why
isn’t clear. No doubt the co. is badly han-
dicapped by lack of funds: there are “sun-
dry creditors” for £2508, and overdraft and
other liabilities amount to £1894. All the
same it is a pity the co. can’t somehow
scratch its way down to No. 6. Prepara-
tions for this job were made two years or
more ago.
About four years ago an abo. named
“Pluto” discovered gold at the Batavia River
(N.Q.). and a rush set in. The other day
the unusual “Pluto” made another discovery
about two miles from his previous find. A
30oz. lump is reported, followed, of course,
by the customary little scramble.
During March Ilampden-Cloncurry (Q.)
produced 622 tons blister copper, the larg-
est converter return for a very long time
past. But don’t be misled —the sudden in-
crease is due to the fact that the Hampden
smelter is now converting matte for the
Corella. It is the Hampden’s policy to
encourage gougers to send in ore by charg-
ing reasonable rates. The copper in the
Corella matte and custom ore amounted
to 169 tons, which leaves 453 tons of blister
for the Hampden Co. The half-year closed
with February, so the report explaining the
financial position should be soon available.
It will be found that heavy expenditure on
mine development has been a drag on so-
called profits.
* * * #
Associated Gold Mines (W.A.) has formed
one of its Canadian specs.—the North
Thompson—into a separate co.. with a capi-
tal of £200.000 in £1 shares. Seven directors
are to receive £lOO per annum each in fees
and to divide 5 p.c. of the profits (if any),
but the maximum amount that any member
of the Board can draw is modestly fixed at
£lOOO. The show adjoins the Hollinger at
Porcupine, and, if official reports are to be
believed, has good prospects-. It is signifi-
cant, however, that nearly all its neighbors
which were also alleged to be “really big
things” have proved disappointing. Nothing
is heard nowadays of Associated’s other
Canadian option—the Keeley—at Cobalt.
When the last puff about it appeared in the
London financial papers a 3in. silver vein,
estimated to be worth £(>00 per ton, was said
to be on view. Since then news has come to
hand that these narrow Cobalt bonanzas die
out very quickly, which probably acounts for
nothing more being heard about the Keeley.
The Mountain Queen, which controls the
Mountain Queen leases at Marvel Loch and
Transvaal leases at Southern Cross (W.A.),
is having the hardest of luck. First of all,
the oxidised ore at the Queen did not come
up to expectations and the sulphides pre-
sented a tough problem. The co. expended
about £lO,OOO of its Queen profits on the
Transvaal, and only «proved that the value
and width of the arsenical ore-body did not
persist with depth. During the past few
months both properties have been under ex-
emption, and one would have thought that
additional troubles would not be encountered
during such a period. But the unexpected
will happen. At the Queen the mine timber-
ing took fire a few weeks ago. and things
looked serious for some days; but the blaze,
whose origin is uncertain, was eventually
subdued. At the Transvaal two terrific rains
struck the mine in January, on each occa-
sion flooding the surface, and doing some
damage to the workings. The Transvaal has
been worked, off and on, for 15 years, and
it is poor luck to have two floods in one
month, each of greater severity than any
ever experienced previously.
* * * *
Yilgarn (W.A.) is looking well at some
of the outlying centres, and the recent heavy
rains may lead to extensive prospecting, and,
possibly, some new finds. But Southern
Cross, the principal town, is doomed so far
as mining is concerned. Fraser’s, which
always meant so much to it, is a drowned rat,
and it is doubtful if there are 25 miners
working within a radius of five miles. A
couple of cyclones struck the town recently,
and blew part of it to the rubbish depit;
and another part is being shifted to Wes-
tonia as rapidly as possible. It looks as
though in a few months all that will be left
of the Cross will be the pubs and the local
newspaper office. And the goats, of course,
At Weston’s (W.A.) things are progress-
ing, and the little shows recently located at
Boodalin Soak are already wearing boom
tints. Prospectors and option hunters are
busy, and a gold bearing outcrop is no sooner
located than it is snapped up. There is
sorrow ahead for many who have too much
to do with the Soak.
What sort of a wicket are the Deeps and
the Central mines on at Weston’s regarding
the unwatering of the mines? There is no
doubt that the pumping operations of the
Edna May are draining the three mines and
the Edna pays for the lot. Certainly it can
afford to; but, under the Act, the Edna May
could compel the other two to bear their
share of the cost. However, the Edna May
directors appear to be too busy signing divi-
dend cheques to bother about such a small
matter.
Lancefield. alias Beria Consols (W.A.),
has again changed hands: This time George
Ilidgway, late engineer of the Great Boul-
der and designer of Ridgway’s roasters, has
bought out the Kalgoorlie and Boulder Fire-
wood Co., which, although claiming to have
250.000 tons of 345. ore in sight, couldn’t
make a do of things. It will surprise most
people who know the mine if Ridgway can
do much better.
* * * *
A suspicious looking concern styled the
Westralian Mines Development Syndicate
has appeared in London and announced that
it has been “primarily formed to acquire the
Successful lease at Kalgoorlie,” recently held
by the Hannans’ Prop. As proof of its
desire to do a good turn to shareholders in
this twice-reconstructed and now partially-
liquidated failure, it offers to let them sub-
scribe for a limited number of ss. (credited
as 4s. paid) shares. As a special treat,
shareholders in another busted Westralian
concern, the Cosmopolitan, are also given
the chance of coming in. In fact, it looks
as though anyone willing to put down a bob
a share would be welcomed. A lot of in-
formation about the performances of other
properties on the field is given in the circular
sent out by the promoters, but not much
about what has been done on the Successful.
Great Poseidon, Poseidon North and
Poseidon King cos. at Tarnagulla (Vic.)
have agreed to amalgamate and form a new
co. The Mines Minister has promised a
subsidy of £5OOO. For taking up 000*0
shares at ss. when the market price was Is.
several shareholders will receive scrip in the
new co. paid up to 7s. Gd. The process of
freezing the shaft having been entirely suc-
cessful, it is likely the further capital will
put this group of mines on its feet without
further calls on the shareholders. Should
the new co. win through, there is plenty of
scope for a mining revival in this rich gold-
bearing district. Tarnagulla has never been
given a proper trial with proper machinery
and capital to a proper depth.
Chairman Harvey, at the Wallaroo and
Moonta meeting, made a bright speech in-
dicating that unless something unlooked for
happened there would be an immediate
return to the old scale of wages. The small
profit made from .Tune to December was
due to the fact that much copper had been
sold forward at low rates. The half-year’s
figures therefore don’t represent what the
co. can do under present conditions. A
dividend is expected in June if the market
holds.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, April 5, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Union rules have almost abolished the
Easter bun; but where it has been available
it has been devoured in comparative calm
this year, minor frivolities being swathed
in conversation about socks and war funds.
In spite of the impression that no one has
any money worth mentioning, the usual bevy
of Mutton Magnates paraded the Show and
the Randwick lawns.
The first race-day at Randwick was a
subdued monologue in clothes. In the
Government House pen, G.-G. Ferguson,
who has a Quaker fancy for grey, was
doubled, as it were, by Excellency Helen.
The lady, in a steel-grey turnout of a chilly
shade, like rain slanting off a slate roof,
wore, besides, her usual Scotchbyterian mil-
linery. The plumes of lesser women stand
up suddenly in front, but Lady Helen’s
feathers lie down quietly all round her hat,
and there’s never a loose tail to break their
calm. Miss Strickland got away from her
favorite blue frocks—which usually match
her forget-me-not eyes—to the extent of
wearing a silvery grey gown flecked with
the gentian tint. In the team of greys sat
hostess Eadith Walker, whose frocking was
a stern shade—something in the way of
macadam metal. Governor Strickland, with
the spatted feet of Help d’Apice pattering,
behind, bustled off to tea with the G.-G.’s
party. Mrs. Jim Burns, with the sauciest
red feather quivering in her small hat, and
one of the new red bows plastered on the
neck of her tailored suit, was included in
the sub-royal tea party. The plump Miss
Birch, who shadows the Strickland kinder-
garten, and the only Consul Wateeuw —
who represents Belgium in immaculate
attire —helped to swell the gubernatorial
chorus.
Sleeves that are mentioned by way of
courtesy,. since they are too thin to count
as covering, came from shoulder to wrist
on some of the gowns. A stout lady clad
in black gave her leg-o’-mutton arms such
an airing behind these transparencies that
part of her corsage seemed to fall into the
same bare patch. She was more comforting
to look at than a very thin lady who fol-
lowed the same style, and revealed to a
scoffing world two bare arms rather more
substantial than a canary’s legs.
Tartans in subdued shades, as either
coats or skirts, are the chief digressions
from the new long coat costumes. These
outline the waist with a broad band about
six inches below its proper address. The
small woman looks like a dark blue pillar-
box, but the tall girl has it all her own way.
Cocked hats are perched on every second
head. Some of them are as sharp as pre-
cipices, and give the hard-faced type the
appearahce of having acquired replicas of
North Head. The new veils, which come
to the edge of the top teeth, have obvious
advantages when light refreshments are
going round. The woman who is fighting
her way out of an entangled mesh of net
is thirsty long after the short-veiled girl
has drenched herself with tea.
Mr. Pudukota, the tall rajah of a ’way-
back Indian territory, had a hurried look at
mountain mists from the Hydro at Medlow.
He got back to town for the races, and ambled
round the lawn on Saturday under the brim
of fashionable green millinery which cast a
livery glare over his complexion. He has
been successfully roped in for a few gilded
feasts, and has already nibbled his way
through the menu in the Eadith Walker man-
sion.
Prime Minister Fisher, on view at the
opening of the Easter crush, wears better
than most of the Labor men in power, and
banquets have left his lean, greyhound figure
as active as of old. The Admirable King-
Hall used to say that “Andy” knew more
about art and literature than most politicians
who broke oysters at Admiralty House. But
you mustn’t tell Little Willie Kelly this—he
wouldn’t believe it, anyhow. Willie has shed
the light of his largest cigars on our Easter
races. On Saturday he strolled on the Rand-
wick lawn, clothed in importance, a sac suit
and a straw boater with the Oxford colors on
its band. Oxford, as you know, is greatly
insisted on by Little Willie. It’s a proof
that, he once rubbed shoulders with the
British peerage in the days when it bought its
first razor.
Australia’s great lawyer, Samuel Griffith,
looks good for a long stretch of birthdays,
though he reaches the Psalmist’s limit this
year. He was frisking on the sub-regal
fringe at the' races with the agility of a
young barrister in pursuit of his first brief.
A few screams paraded the lawn on
Saturday. Amongst them may be respect-
fully mentioned two hats that seemed to
turn everything on them up to Heaven, and
in doing so made heavy weather of the trim-
ming, which lurched over on one side at an
angle of 75 degrees. This millinery was
accompanied by glace silk gowns of weird
beflounced splendor. Mrs. Reddall, heavily
rugged in a check cape, which she clutched at
after the manner of 80-peep, and short
skirt of the same, was at least original.
Mrs. Willie Anderson’s rose-pink frock and
headgear of white water lilies, gummed on to
the new tartlet shape, were good to look at.
Doris Buckland trailed yards of black
coating over a tartan skirt. Mr. Tom
Hughes and his fine, upstanding missus—
the latter in something neat and indefinite
in dark brown —lcjoked very sprightly after
their Tasmanian trip. Mrs. Hope Osborne
was fiercely envied for a black frock which
was laid out in stratas of satin and em-
broidery. The Bjirdekin family, with Miss
“Burdie” in her inevitable pink gown, and
Mrs. Alex. Play (with diaphanous draperies
coming to a point, so to speak, in the only
20-inch waist visible in this muffled world
of capes and coats), took up a commanding
position on _the brink of the members’ stand
to say how-do to their acquaintances. The
youthful Mrs. Metcalfe Jackson, a Persian
kitten in fluffy grey drapery, was accom-
panied by papa Leonard Dodds, who carried
a heavy walking-stick—a male fashion of
the warlike hour. Mrs. Maxwell Allan was
heel-and-toe in the longest and latest notion
in navy coating serge. Stacks of Osbornes,
McMasters, a few Daltons of Orange, and
inter-State visitors—including Mrs. Geoff-
rey Syme, clad in raven frills —contrived to
make themselves happy in spite of the con-
duct of Wilhelm 11.
Political dames made a fringe for the
Society crush. Mrs. David Hall, quietly
turned out in mouSe-color, and Mrs. Arthur
Griffith, with the latest tailored cut in
sombre blue, were in the forefront of style.
The Dick Horsfalls —she used to be Miss
Fosbery—bustled this way after a holiday
in Geyserland. Mrs. Dick keeps up her
old record for showing the neatest pair of
ankles in the latest footgear on the Rand-
wick lawn. In consequence of the weepy
weather on Easter Monday, a stout pair of
goloshes was the wiser wear on the sodden
grass. But, with skirts ever, so many
inches off the soil, no smart dame would
dare to be rubber shod.
G.-G. Ferguson opened the big Easter
Show on a day that brought joy to the
heart of Hayseed—who was also present.
Before the ceremony, which always occurs
in a cane-chair annexe in front of the ram-
shackle old “grandstand”—his Ex. and
party looked in at the small official shelter.
Here the rain fell softly through occasional
holes in the roof, and only half a slice of
vice-regal splendor could safely seat itself
on its red velvet cushion at one time.
The Scotch Excellencies, with the Agri-
cultural Show President, the late Francis
Suttor (this was the cheery old man’s last
public appearance, and his usually rubicund
face was drawn and suddenly aged), fitted
in as best they could. A couple of Suttor
daughters, Mrs. Mayoress Richards, with
Mr. Mayor and Deputy-Town-Clerk Layton
in the rear, prospected and then sat down
carefully. Mrs. Layton slid gently into a
drought area of the stand, next to Mrs.
Harry Finn, who had to keep her best hat
out of the grass-growing weather. General
Finn bobbed up serenely behind. Mr. Harry
Morton, one of the most comfortable-looking
persons present, kept a sharp eye to the
wants of Mrs. Harry as the teacups flowed
round. “Flowed” is the correct word, for
several tipped over owing to some of those
present inadvertently putting a hand or a
boot into the crockery in its progress. Sec-
retary Somer, a busy man when the country
comes to town, appeared and disappeared
as circumstances required.
G.-G. Ferguson, who slipped off alone at
the Show, got lost amongst the exhibits, and
had to ask a policeman the way home. While
a worried Aide, Captain Fane, fled round
the agricultural trophies in search of a
lost sub-royalty, the Ferguson was stamping
steadily back to his billet under the wing
of the Law. The huge motor in waiting for
his Ex. had. by the way. a small silver figure-
head of a Bobby putting up his hand to stop
the traffic. One vassal in bottle-green livery
paced up and down beside this chariot,
while the second sat behind the steering gear.
A third retainer cast inquiring glances at
the Showground gates till the Ferguson was
recovered from the bellowing herd inside.
It takes quite a retinue to haul a G.-G. in
safety over the rocky road to Concord.
Mrs. James Ashton and Miss Consett
Stephen were mainly responsible for the
Red Cross exhibit. On judging day this was
housed in a tent. As the rain fell in tor-
rents little Mrs. Rouse (formerly of Bath-
urst) paddled round in charge, goloshed and
coated. Holding up a big umbrella, she used
her free hand to bale the water out of the
flooded stall. A move was made to the
shelter of an adjacent roof for the remainder
of the show.
The riding events on the opening day put
the Tasmanian, Dolly Fogg, in the front
place. She has shorn off her windmill hair-
bows since Easter, 1914, and has remodelled
her seat in the saddle after the style of the
brilliant Victorian horsewoman, Alice McCul-
loch —now in France or thereabouts. Mrs.
Stace, perched like a fly on the old-fashioned
horned menace, cleared the timber in a less
attractive fashion than the ride-astride girls.
Phyllis Elliot, the South Coast girl whose
mother used to skim the big hurdles like a
swallow, came out top in the amateur sec-
tion, with Miss E. Morton hard on her
horse’s heels for second place. The pluck of
all the riders is worth a gasp of admiration,
for the ground was as slippery as wet glass.
Sydney people will remember Mrs. Monro
Masters. Since she spent some time here
years ago, she has married again. Her
second choice was Captain Slayten, R.N.
When the uproar began he was in charge of
Greenwich Naval College; then he put to
sea under sealed orders. After desperate
suspense his wife read in the papers of his
shipwreck, and later on found that there
had been no loss of life. In the midst of
this excitement her eldest son, Trevor
Masters, a middy, packed up his jacket for
his post. The lad went to the bottom early
on New Year’s morning in a howling gale
in the English Channel. He was Austra-
lian born, christened by Archdeacon Lang-
ley (whose whiskers were once the joy of
The Bulletin end of Sydney) in St.
Philip’s. Godpa was an old friend of the
family—war correspondent Frederic Villiers,
who happened to be here at the time.
Mrs. William Collins, of Bananaland, a
relative of the Simon Fraser clan, has been
swirling her draperies in the Easter dress
parade. And when Mrs. Collins, who was
a Maorilander to start with, swirls, the
swirl is something considerable.
The N.S.W. Tennis Association will start
its inter-State matches in aid of the Patri-
otic Fund on April 16.
The Reggie White couple, of Muswell-
brook, are in town for the big Horns and
Hoofs parade.
The large and portly Clara Manning, a
daughter of the late knight William Man-
ning, is chaperoning her niece, Joan Tre-
garthen, in London.
Paderewski’s appeal to the prosperous
farmers of Australasia on behalf of Poland
is to get a public airing presently. Chief
Justice Cullen, waited on the other day by
Mrs. George Earp and a flying squadron,
gave a willing promise to preside at the
first meeting. This takes place in the
Queen Victoria Club on April 9 at 3 p.m.
Paderewski gives us the stunning news that
over 10,000,000 of his compatriots, chiefly
tillers of the soil, are without a crust or a
roof at the present moment. An area equal
to that of England and Scotland is a bat-
tered remains, and the enemy still rages
there or thereabouts with his accustomed
ferocity.
Laurence Godfrey Smith’s farewell recital
drew a full house of friends and pupils to
St. James’s Hall. _ Admiring flappers gloated
over the pianist’s record-breaking swoops
on cadenzas and other tricky wild animals,
and bursts of enthusiasm greeted his crash-
ing chords. The Spencer Bruntons were
in the audience —Mrs. Spencer is a musician
of some prowess. The usual array of lean
Society backs showed signs of returning
consciousness when Mrs. Hugh Ward swept
on to the platform in something Very New
in peacock draperies. The top terrace was
a shimmer of satin that fell over a soft
flounce of speckled moonshine. The singer,
in her best voice, was specially melodious in
Liza Lehmann’s delicate morsel, “Mirage.”
Mowat Carter shouldered his gun—l mean
his. fiddle —at frequent intervals in the
recital. Laurel wreaths to Smith, who goes
to help Our Friends in France, were surrep-
titiously passed along to the hero. But he
was too modest to crown the small bare
patch on top of his head with any of the
herbage, and went off meekly in a crescendo
of applause.
The J. L. Trefle memorial fund is slowly
ripening, and the joint hon. secretaries, T.
M. Shakespeare and Robert McMillan,
clamor for your help. The primary object
is to erect a home for Mrs. Trefle and to
pay for the education of the children. The
late Minister for Lands, being a straight
goer, died a poor man after supping
honestly of the sweets of office.
Mrs. Ted Edols, who used to live on
Burrawang station, in the Forbes' district,
is sheltering in the once-ambrosial area of
St. John’s Wood, London. The late Miss
Braddon lived thereabouts for years, and
it is still the favorite haunt of any writers
and artists who don’t happen to be in the
trenches.
One of the Glen Innes Ogilvie girls,
Eileen, will have promised to love, honor
and obey (with mental reservations, I sup-
pose) Alex. Anderson before this reaches
you. The groom also belongs to a pasto-
ralist family, I think, with flocks that graze
in the same district.
Sylvia Bremer, the amazing young woman
who has commanded recognition in her own
city of Sydney, is one of the daintiest mor-
sels of feminine charm on the Australian
stage. As Virginia Blaine, in “Bought and
Paid For,” at the Criterion, she steps into
the part Muriel Starr had to abandon during
a bout with appendicitis. Sylvia, who&e
voice trembles with emotion in the right
key, is a relief after a plethora of ’Murkan
accent, and she wears her dresses on a slim,
graceful figure like a dream girl in a Dana
Gibson sketch-book. She is a niece of the
late Commander Gordon Bremer, R.N.
Grandpa Bremer used to live at Bose Bay
in the days when snakes were wont to
ramble round the quiet old garden, and the
scream of seagulls was the only foreword
of the modern motor horn.
The Hon. Maud Pauncefote has been
holding forth on Australia’s charms to
London’s pale-faced work girls. The net
profit to us at present is a recent shipment
of 17 domestic servants for these shores.
But what are 17 amongst so many?, I
don’t know. I’m afraid you’ll have to ask
a policeman. I never loas any good at
fractions.
W. H. East, of Holmleigh, Bexley, has
added £7B to the Belgian Fund. This was
the profit of a fete in the grounds of the
East homestead, the expenses being only
£4 10s. Percy Hunter, one of the fund’s
hon. custodians, tore open the show, and
assured the company that the cash would
be disbursed by the American consul in
Belgium, so there need be no tremors lest
the enemy should buy himself champagne
with the money.
To lure still another copper or two into the
Belgian hat there’s to be a garden party at
the Wentworth Hotel on April 9. On be-
half of the directors, Mrs. Maclurcan puts
the premises at the disposal of the Women’s
Committee; and the Cullen dame is to be
high priestess of the show. It is said that
the £75,000 a month, which is Australia’s
suggested dole, will feed the hungry in King
Albert’s little paddock for one day in 30.
It doesn’t look more than Australia’s share,
does it?
Artist Norman Carter is to put on a cocked
hat and, other ancient upholstery and be
Captain Cook in the Art Students’ tableaux.
Norman, having rather a far-off expression
at times, ought to wear the ancient
mariner’s toggery with success.
Mr. Harry Chisholm had a cable from
Mrs. Harry to say that she wasn’t leaving
Egypt for home and gum trees so soon as ex-
pected. Pretty daughter Sheila is with
mamma, and Audrey Chirnside is, or was,
under the same wing. Like most other
Expeditionaries, Chisholm, junior, is yearning
to get to business on the Front.
Dances being apparently on the shelf for
the present, St. Margaret’s Hospital for
Women is going to put its faith in a bazaar.
This old-fashioned fixture has come to the
fore again, after having been for years in
the cupboard along with the forgotten anti-
macassars. The affair opens on May 20.
and the Hospital committee, which is in
the usual impecunious condition, hopes to
make a three-days’ raid.
The Arts and Crafts’ Society is on the
lookout for anything you can spare. Its
Easter show in Norwich Chambers is spread
out on a large table surrounded by caged
trophies, such as art jewellery and painted
china. Take the lift.
Governor Strickland’s eldest treasure,
Mary, can chat in fluent Italian to Papal
Legate Cerretti, and then break into con-
versational French for the benefit of Consul-
General Chayet. I haven’t heard whether
she is tackling the Jap. language yet, but
that may come before the war is o’er.
The Walter Bentley Players had their first
dramatic airing for 1915 in the Repertory
Theatre the other evening. Large and healthy
members of the audience observed with accla-
mation the increase in the size of the dress-
circle seats. Originally designed to hold
shadowy forms, they are now almost big
enough to contain an alderman. In “The Mini-
ster’s Daughter,” described as a domestic
drama, actor Bentley, who is a very big man,
had to struggle with a stage villain about
half his fighting weight. When his cries for
help brought a pocket assistant on the scene
the house rippled with mirth. A Young
Person whose attire was punctuated with
very stormy-looking red hair-bows, presided
at the piano, which was the orchestra. In
that capacity she fell headlong, with some
slaughter, through an overture of popular
melodies, and gave the “Barcarolle” a hearty
beating in the process.
“Melba’s Book” is in course of prepara-
tion. It is to follow the lines pursued in
“King Albert’s Book” for the Belgian funds.
Florence Rodway’s portrait of the skylark
will probably be reproduced as the frontis-
piece.
_ Rosina Buckmann, the Maoriland song-
bird, has been uplifting her voice for the
Belgian cause in London. After an enter-
tainment at the Mansion House —hard by
the habitat of Gog and Magog—Rosina was
patted on her plump shoulders for her suc-
cessful efforts.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORLIAN.

formerly of Stutterlieim, South
Africa, believed to have come to Australia
about the year 1907, or anyone knowing of
his whereabouts, is requested to communi-
cate with The Colonial Mutual Life Assur-
ance Society, Limited, 419 Collins Street,
Melbourne, in connection with a policy on
his life.
MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, April 5, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
I can’t help thinking that a lot of good
people are getting a heap of entertainment
out of this war. On liose Day,, for instance,
in Melbourne, there is to be a band of
ordinary suburbanites in masks, who will
sing and then collect for the poor Belgians.
The masks will hide the features of a few
social dames and others who migbft never
attract attention or excite curiosity under
ordinary concert conditions. I believe that
amongst them will be a curate or a canon who
is capable of something beyond the usual
incantations. If there were no poor Bel-
gians, this frolic would be impossible. If
more money is wanted, I wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see bishops in tights with tambour-
ines. Oh, I tell you there’s lots of fun in
the poor Belgians.
John Madden came back by the Morea,
which had on board a nigger with small-
pox, and was, of course, quarantined. Son
Guy, knowing nothing of this, hurried to the
pier, and waited for hours before learning
the facts. The waxcellency was taken down
to Point Nepean with the mailboat, and sen-
tenced to 24 hours without the option. At
first it was feared that he would have to “do
time” for 21 days, but, having been success-
fully vaccinated of late,, he was released,
with about 20 others. The C.J. is looking
more pleased with himself than ever. _ Per-
haps it is because he just escaped going to
Berlin.
Robert Parker drew all the music-lovers
who had stayed in town over Easter to the
Town Hall on Saturday night. Memories
of his Devil in the “Tales” even kept some
enthusiasts back from the hills and the sea.
When he actually arrived in the tlesh he got
a stirring welcome from a good house. Car-
men Pinschof Harris, back from her foreign
wanderings, aired a well-polished voice and
a white, shimmery lace thing looped up
with a tunic of eau de nil and a pint of
jewels. Melba, wrapped in a chinchilla fur
coat, was attended by her son and daughter-
in-law, the latter swathed in a scaly silver
scarf that left nothing else visible except
pale blue shoes and stockings. A dame who
evidently thought purple the only wear for
the end of Lent, revived sad memories of
public buildings during periods of national
mourning. Little Florence Scapini, the vio-
linist of the co., is still in short frocks, and
wears most of her dark locks hanging round
her jolly little face. Pianist Mrs. de Brandt’s
most striking garment was a vivid red skirt
which seemed to lose its way, but was helped
out by an inadequate undergarment of black
lace. Her music, however, was most satis-
factory.
When votes of thanks are being passed
out to those who are making sacrifices for
the Red Cross cause, the big Melbourne
Hospital ought to get a pat for its donations
of skilled nurses. Only devotion to Country
and Flag prevents Superintendent Tait from
breaking out into protests. A big gap was
made when Matron Bell left with a corps
of nurses, including five staff sisters. Then
the Defence people fixed their eyes upon two
more of the seniors and they were given up
to the new Police Hospital, which has been
set apart for damaged warriors. _ The in-
stitution was only getting into its stride
again after this raid, when two more of the
white-caps were called away to fix up things
at Osborne House, Geelong. Sister Tait
was Lady Assistant or First Lady-in-Wait-
ing to Matron Bell before that lady donned
her army uniform. She will have command
at the big healing shop till the ■end of tne
war.
Mrs. Davidson is now setting her traps for
a Carnival- —either Belgian or Red Cross —I
don’t know which—at the Salon de Luxe, on
the evening of April 17. There will be danc-
ing for the able-legged, and other dissipations
for those who scorn to learn the slinks and
scuffles of outrageous ragtime. Lady Helen
is to be there, so the riot is assured of a gilt
edge. Lesly Madden is in full sail and
will continue so until the post is passed,
stumps drawn and the curtain rung down.
Roma Clarke is rounding up the sweets-
sellers. Sister Vanda, having a fiance to
amuse, has scratched herself for this event.
The widow Staughton is bestowing the light
of her countenace on the affair, and Professor
Allen’s dame is suffusing it with University
limelight. A local charity-—the Girls’
Training Home—is to share the profits with
the other Cause. The word has gone forth
that the show will be “quite nice, y’ know,”
but a bit daring in a restrained way. I
don’t know what it means, but it suggests a
curate wearing winkers and a kicking strap.
The ancients themselves might have ap-
plauded the Spartan attitude of a pretty
Society girl who refused to wed with her
young man unless he swore to go to the
firing line at the close of the honeymoon.
The prospective bridegroom said he would,
so the confetti has been ordered.
Lieut. Finlay Champ, having lost his
appendix in Egypt, is being invalided home,
but hopes to make a second start presently.
The convalescing officer is a grandson of the
late Colonel Champ, who was one of the
social figureheads of Melbourne in the ’6o’s,
when his daughters were recognised as the
belles of the city.
Exchange-officer Major Manser has been
on the sick list, and looks as emaciated as if
he had done three months on starvation
rations. His worry is that his job is to
stay behind and tit up transports instead of
helping to smash the enemy in person.
A letter from an Australian nurse in
France mentions that artist Rupert Bunny
was at the hospital (wherever it is) the
other day. He has a job as orderly.
From my Adelaide correspondent:
Captain Allan Wright, whose death at the Front was
lately reported, called on brother Boer as a buglei,
and afterwards got a commission in the Royal Irish
Rifles. His mother and two sisters, Mrs. Hills and
Miss Helen Wright, are living in England, and his
other sister is the wife of H. P. Gill, one of our
best-known artists. Major Charles Clough is another
of ours to pay the toll of the war. He was. a son ot
Charles Clough, for some years resident railway
engineer at Mount Barker, and now one of the County
Council engineers in London. Both were old St.
Peter’s College boys.
The Elder Scholarship for the violin and the
Alexander Clark Memorial Scholarship have both been
annexed by Merle Robertson, a backblocks girl who
was brought to Adelaide to develop her talent foi
composition. She has studied under Eugene Alderman
and William Silver, and both of them have already
booked a place for her in the musical heavehs.
Governor Galway at the Murray Bridge Show made
a further -appeal for brisk recruiting, and told the
public what it has guessed—that he had appealed for
leave to temporarily vacate Government House in
favor of the trenches, but couldn’t get permission.
It is not an easy thing for a soldier to be held by
civilian duties at a time like this- and it can t :
make the thing easier when he sees scores of eligi-
bles imagining that they've done their duty when
they have hung flags over their motors and sung
Gor’save constantly and discordantly.
Angas Parsons was elected to fill the vacancy on
the University Senate created by the resignation of
new Agent-General Young. There were originally two
other candidates—W. R. Bayley, the new headmaster
of Prince Alfred College, and “Tommy” Ryan, but
Bayley withdrew before the ballot was taken.
Dr. J. B. Dawson, of Glenelg, left by the Mon-
golia for London to rejoin the R.A.M.C.
Thomas Scarfe, the hardware merchant, died worth
£600,000. His will contains a fine set of legacies to
the old employees of his firm —Harris, Scarfe and Co.
—up to as much as £lOOO in some cases.
Mr. and Mrs. Guy Makin left by the Mongolia
for England* and Italy. Mr. David Jones, Mrs.
Makin’s father, arrived from Melbourne by the
same boat on his way to London. Mrs. Mouchette
and Mrs. Lion, two of our best-known French resi-
dents,, have also booked passages. Australia has
been their home for years, but since the outbreak
of war they have been pining to get back to
their own country to do something—anything. Mrs.
Mouchette will probably make Paris her headquar-
ters ; Mrs. Lion hopes to .be able to give special
attention to the nursing needs of any Australian
troops who may be in France.
Our Belgian visitor, de Martin; and his wife, left
on Thursday for Maoriland en route for home, and
were farewelled in the Unley Town Hall. His lec-
tures have done a good deal towards helping along
local war lists, especially the Belgian Fund and the
Wattle Day Motor Ambulance Fund. Meanwhile, so
that w 7 e shall not perish from lack of lectures and
shut up our purses for lack of excuse to give, Prof.
Henderson has arranged to lecture us three times on
“The Great War.” Proceeds for Belgium.
Miss Howard, of Fullarton, has made a collection
of things to be sold by auction in the Mayor’s
parlor on April 16th, and on the Bth a sale of Belgian
flags will be conducted in the city streets from eight
till six. The city has been divided into blocks, and
everybdoy who is anybody is taking part. A couple
of processions have been arranged to lure people
from the safety of their homes, and masked singers
will make music and other noises at street corners.
A league has been formed to supply the 1000
pairs of socks that are needed per month, and on
Wednesday afternoon members of the committee are
available at the Town Hall to give instructions in
the strategic handling of knitting needles. This
practical effort" is in existence chiefly at the instiga-
tion of Mrs. T. E. Barr Smith and Mrs. Carew
Reynell.
Dr. and Mrs. Gething left during the week on an
excursion to Java and Singapore.
Colonel Rowell, who commanded the Fourth South
Aus. Contingent in the S’African War, is working
on the transport of troops from here to Europe. As
he must now quit Adelaide he was farewelled by
the committee of the S’African Soldiers’ Association
on Tuesday, with Captain J. A. Watt in the top
seat.
Canon Girdlestone, of St. Peter’s College, has
received cable news that his youngest brother, Capt.
M. A. Girdlestone, of the 41st Dogras Regiment, has
been killed. Captain Baynes, who was for a time
A.D.C. to the Bosanquets, has died of wounds;
and Lieut. Conran, a Westralian whose mining people
were at one time here, has been' wounded whilst
reconnoitring with a Flying Corps in Flanders.
The Walter Bagots and Dr. and Mrs. Cecil Corbin,
who were in the quarantined Morea, have been dis-
infected and released. Mr. Valentine Soul has also
been allowed to tear himself away from Torrens
Island, and is staying with the Charles Goodes, in
North Adelaide.
Died at Largs Bay, Capt. C. S. Elliot, R.N., who
was acting as District Naval Officer in Commander
Burford’s place. He was on the reserve list, and
was living in Sydney when the war broke out.
Offering his services, he was transferred here. Four
of his sons are on active service—two with the
Australians in Egypt, one in Papua, and the other
in the North Sea. He was a Scotchman by birth,
and after retiring from the navy 13 years ago was
Chief Magistrate at Norfolk Island.
Several parties of suburban amateurs have
lately visited the camp at Broadmeadows for
entertaining purposes. For the most part
they have not been deliriously successful.
Most of the vocalists have too marked a
fondness for “Mary of Argyle” and other
grand but doleful airs. The boys have
shown great patience and heroism, although
at times the officer in charge has to im-
plore them to “Listen to this song, and then
we will have some boxing.” (Loud cheers.)
Nobody has actually been presented with
the “bird”; but a rendering of “Home,
Sweet Horde” by a lady whose intentions
were honorable was received with wild emo-
tion that was too unbridled to be genuine.
The most popular performer is a bright St.
Kilda girl, who will “rag” as long as she
has any voice or hairpins left.
Take this story for what it’s worth, and
if it is underweight don’t blame me. Two
agonised squatters, who had cricked their
necks watching the dry heavens, sent an
appeal to Wragge to let them know the
worst or the , best. Wragge wrote back
“Ten guineas, please A’ The money was
promptly forwarded, and back came the
cheerless answer: “No real rains till June.”
Beastly 10 guineas’ worth, that.
Explorer Mawson’s wife (she used to be
Miss Delprat) is in Melbourne. She stays
with her mother at Linden, the Malvern
house, and pets the one lone dog that re-
turned from the ice with Douglas.
The youngest Sproule girl got married a
week or so ago at Flinders, of all places.
The local peerage motored down there and
bitterly cursed the roads, remarking forci-
bly that Flinders might be a good place for
a honeymoon, but was a poor pitch for
a wedding. However, they found on arrival
that the bride looked sweet, and had a lovely
frock, so they hadn’t the heart to charge
her time and a half for their professional
attendance.
These anomalous-looking consecutive items
from woman’s special column of the Age
have aroused the sex’s curiosity :
UPHILL.—On the 22nd March, at St. Kilda,
Tom Collins, loved husband of Tressy Uphill, aged
63 years.
UPHILL.—On the 22nd March, Tom C. Uphill,
Esq., of Pranjip Park, Murchison East, loved hus-
band of Nancy (nee Porter), of Punt-road, South
Yarra, father of Hector (First Australian Expedi-
tionary Forces, Egypt), Jessie, Ellen and Victor.
Some of the second-best suburban dressing-
gowns are still in consultation with the lady
next door with a view to elucidating the
matter.
Miss Elmhirst-Goode has changed her
final name to Anderson. The fate of the
Elmhurst hung in the balance; but as the
new husband thinks he understands, the
value of a double-barrelled name to a singer,
it will stand impressively as Elinhurst-
Anderson.
Mrs. Charlie Tait and Mrs. Scott are the
fatigue party sent out in advance to pre-
pare for Rose Bay, which is due on April S
—the birthday of the Belgian King. The
Commercial Travellers have lent a room
which will be the central depdt. It is a
huge apartment, and will be packed with
masses of blooms for distribution amongst the
selling depots. Attorney-General Hughes’s
daughter will be one of Mrs. Tait’s helpers,
and golf champion Patterson’s sister another.
The Patterson girl approves of the regula-
tion white dressing, for she has brilliant red
hair.
The Melbourne Davidsons have a niece
visiting these parts. The young person’s
name is Muriel, and her peggy-bag is burst-
ing with Grandpa Davidson’s money. Her
engagement to Dr. Tyree has just been pro-
claimed, and I believe that the fond medi-
cine man came to town specially to hear
the solemn words spoken. His fiancee sold
Belgian flags on ’Change during the recent
raid, and a sharebroker who should have
known better offered her £2O for a kiss.
The doctor was standing almost at the fair
seller’s elbow at the moment, and the
wretched man of stocks and shares got a
most awful look. I think his contorted body
was found later in a lane whither he had
crawled to die.
Mrs. Norman Tiernan and Mrs. Cyrus
Barlow are going to use the reckless old
sport of croquet to inflate the Red Cross
Fund. Mrs. Tiernan is lending her East
Melbourne garden for a gymkhana on April
10. There will also be minor swindles, in-
cluding games of chance that are, as a rule,
only met with at church bazaars and on race-
courses.
Frances Frazer squeezed £3OO out of her
jumble auction in aid of the Belgians. If
I had a trumpet by me, and could blow it, 1
would give a real rousing blast for Frances.
Long may she bushrange !
Mrs. Masseran, well known in these parts
at French festivals, has ceased travelling in
the U.S., and gone back to help her native
France. The patriotic lady was in the
siege of Paris, ever so many years ago, and
still remembers the taste of horseflesh.
All Woman’s World—including, of
course, the actor himself, who is part of it
—loves an actor. The minute you hear that
the immaculate Fred Niblo, traveller in
verbal softgoods, is to auction gifts for the
Repertory people, at the Club Rooms, on
Friday afternoon, April 16, you will there-
foi-e rush like a devoted lunatic. I will rush
like another. And we will meet on the
threshold with glad shrieks of recognition
and pour in together.
The Arthur Symes and their horses have
been disturbing the Easter mud in Sydney.
The farming Symes—Francis and Oswald
and their women-folk —have also been there,
as well as a few McAlisters. Mrs. Geoffrey,
of the Syme clan, took over some new short
frocks wherewith to startle the Rand-
wickians. They were winter garments,
eminently suitable for the disarrangement
of weather that happened along, so I guess
she was fairly happy.
There has- been a great gathering of the
clans at Cliveden Mansions to meet the
returned John Madden pair. Daughter
Ruby came down from the Willeroo station
for a visit, and Lesley bloomed in the fore-
ground. The reunited family retired to
Frankston for Easter.
The wife of lawyer Woolf has gone over
to Sydney to comfort her sister, the young
widow of pressman G. M. Redmond, the
victim of the Manly motor accident. The
sisters have always been inseparable chums.
They are daughters of old Bendigo mining-
man North.
Irma Caron is following up her Belgian
Flag Day triumphs with concerts at the
Athenaeum Hall —three consecutive nights of
them. The first is to-night (Thursday),
and it will doubtless get vice-regal and gaud-
mayoral patronage ; anyway, the petite artist
with the chic personality and the ringing
soprano voice has earned that encouragement
and more. To-morrow or Saturday should
be a Stock Exchange night. Miss Caron so
captivated the brokers on the Flag occasion
that she was asked to let them have word
of the first time she could be heard on
the concert platform, and they would attend
in force. And it isn’t every visiting
songstress they want to hear again, let me
tell you. The bulls and the bears are “con-
nusers,” in their Collins-street way.
Even the birthday of Divine William is to
be turned to Belgian Fund account. The
Shakspeare Society is arranging a Birthday,
Celebration, to happen at the Masonic Hall
on the 23rd. Meanwhile the members will
meet again at the Salon on the 9th, and
devote all the time to “Twelfth Night.” Why
don’t they give “Venus and Adonis” a turn.''
The Godfrey sisters are back in Melbourne,
fed up with exciting experiences—chief
amongst which was the Scarborough bom-
bardment and detention here, on arrival, at
the quarantine station. Life now is full of
trials for those who have money enough to
travel round in search of them.
Sylvia Little, the South Yarra belle, who
has both cash and beauty—two things excel-
lent in woman —has returned from her trip
to Canada engaged to James Webb, the doc-
tor on the boat she travelled by.' When Syl-
via left here last year Mrs. Rumor engaged
her to a well-known Sydney journalist. Of
course she lied. This latest engagement,
though, is definite and official.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
Charles; Walch, Hobart’s ancient book-
seller, who died at the age of 85 last week,
has been in the business for over 60 years.
He was the compiler of Walcli’s Red Book,
the only almanac and general directory the
Speck has needed since 1860, or thereabouts.
The late useful citizen was a mine of in-
teresting reminiscences of the early days. In
the ’so’s and ’6o’s books used to reach
Hobart from overseas in yearly lots. and
were sold at auction. A gross of “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin” (a shilling paper-cover edi-
tion) cost Walch at auction 50s. per dozen;
and he sold them all at ss. each, Bishop
Nixon being the first customer.
Dropped from S. Aus. Parliament: Peake,
Premier; Parsons, Attorney-General; and
Herman Homburg. who recently made way
for Parsons in office, but thought his Ger-
man name need not bar his re-election for
the Murray district. Electors thought
otherwise, and dropped also Pflaum, his
colleague. Duhst and another Homburg did
not stand again—wisely, no doubt. Murray
rubbed it in by electing at the head of the
poll the colleague who stood with Herman
Homburg and Pflaum (there are three
seats), along with two candidates from the
other side.

“McNorth”: The Papuans west of Port
Moresby treat crocogators with a good deal of con-
tempt. At the mouth of the Vailala River I saw
some women fishing with the cone-shaped basket
peculiar to that region. As one woman stooped
+n investigate her haul, a croc, appeared like a
flash and tore her right breast away. There was a
scatter; but after ( the injured woman had been
taken ashore, a crowd of villagers waded out and
beat drums for half an hour or so in order to
frighten the beast away. Then the fishing went
on as before. A cheerful savage of my acquaint-
ance once told me that in his village, in the Puari
Delta, they catch crocs, alive by a very simple
method. First the ’gator is located lying on the
bottom in clear water. Then a fleet of canoes sur-
rounds the spot, and the blacks kick up a row for
an hour by means of drums, yelling and beating
their bodies with the palms of their hands. When
it is considered that the horizontal devil is paralysed
with fear, a man slips over the side with a long
rope, at the end of which is a strong cane loop.
He swims dowm and slips the loop over the head of
his prey, and the rest is easy. It is always an old
man who is sent to do the looping business. You
see, an old man hasn’t got a| : ' long to live as a
young man, and if he meets with an accident the
inevitable has merely forestalled itself.

“ J.G.”: As lonely a death outback as ever
came under my observation was that of a woman
who resided in a big sawmill camp near the top of
Mount Disappointment (Vic.). One dark and stormy
night she left home ; and when she didn’t return in
a reasonable time the camp was roused and every
man, boy and dog searched and scrambled about
the mountain side till morning. Then the neighboring
townships were alarmed, and hundreds of searchers
went out and ransacked the rough country adjacent.
The search went on for several days, but not a sign
of the missing woman was seen. Eventually she
was given up as lost beyond recovery. Almost a
year afterwards a sportsman, scrambling about the
sides of the mount in search of something to shoot,
came across her remains under a limb of a tree. The
branch had fallen on her and had kept her a
prisoner until she died.
EXPERIENCED.
MINE MANAGER: “Done any minin' at all?"
A PPLICANT: 'A bit."
MINE MANAGER: “What sort?"
A PPLICANT: “Min'in' sheep."
“T. 0.1.”: How’s this for luck? J. A.
Gardiner held an annual lease, and his application
to convert it into an improvement-lease was recom-
mended by the Trangie (N.S.W.) Land Board; but
the Minister exercised his authority, over-ruled the
recommendation, and made the land available for a
homestead farm. Over 200 marbles were put in,
and J. A. Gardiner’s was the first out!
A REASON ABL E R EQUEST.
“Say, Miss, could yer shew us a bedroom? I wanter ’ave a wash aid a brush-up before
goin' in ter dinner."
“Snell”: Ilokeby sec-med a quiet, decent
sort; of fellow, and I wondered that Crowfoot, a
township not extremely particular in the choice of
its acquaintances, should have made something of a
pariah of him. He lived in the second house on the
left, going in, and was cut off from all neighbors.
He never did any mischief that I could see, yet no
one had a good word for him. He did not join in
the festivities at Park’s bar, he was not"an attendant
at the Sunday-afternoon Two-up School in Jasper’s
barn, and he absented himself from all raffles and
dances. When I questioned Jasper about the matter,
Jasper replied with a frill of profanity: “Oh, him!
He’s no sort of good. He’s a cow, that’s what. He
ran away with his mate’s missus.” “Is that the
present Mrs. Rokeby?” I asked. “Yes. She’s Tom
Delaney’s wife, ’n’ this swine ran away with her.
This was four years ago, and no one here’s had any
truck with him since.” I’d seen and heard some-
thing of the doings and sayings of Mrs. Rokeby—•
politely so-called —and thought Rokeby’s action sub-
stantial proof of unsound mind; but it did not
keep me from sundry business dealings with him.
One day he unbosomed. “You know,” he said, “they
all got me set here ’cause I took away Mrs. Tom
Delaney when Tom was off on a job at Pinetop ; but
if these cows is agin me, there’s others ain’t. Read
that.” He took a very worn letter from a tattered
and blackened envelope, and handed it to me. It read:
“Dear Artie, so you’ve Toped off with my missus,
and I now take up my pen to say how if I can ever
do you a good turn I’ll do it. I nevei* had a better mate
nor you, and never one done me better turns. God’s
truth, you won’t go back on it! Hopin’ you are all
well, as this leaves me at present, yours truly, thanks
from the bottom of my heart, Tom Delaney.”
Rokeby, watched my face as I read, and when I’d done
he said: “I’d ha’ sent ’er back long ago if it hadn’t
bin fer that. Now I ain’t got the ’eart to.” And
Artie is still despicable to all Crowfoot.
“Avis” : Sparrows were introduced to Aus-
tralia in 1863, when 120 of them were set a-flying-
in Melbourne Botanical Gardens, with accompany-
ing orations on the glory of Old England. Fearing
they mightn’t dp, 125 more were loosed in 1864,
and some more in 1866. In 1867 a number of the
pets were caught in Melbourne and sent all over
the State to make surer of the blessing. They began
to be noticed as a pest in 1880 ; now they are the
commonest of our birds. The starling was also in-
troduced in 1863, when 36 were liberated in Mel-
bourne. Smaller lots followed in 1864 and ’66, and
a last lot of 20 in ’7l. Even in that period they
had demonstrated that England need not furnish
any more. They long stuck to Melbourne, like the
present immigrants, but ultimately went bushwards.
Yet they got to Western Victoria only 12 years ago.
The Englishers there were in raptures. But soon it
was: “Oh, no, you mustn't touch fruit. You know
you don’t in England.” “Oh, but,” says the bird,
“your vermin is nasty.” Before long, the starlings
had driven out parrots, owls and kookaburras, con-
quering by mere numbers. Indeed hundreds cannot
find nesting places, and drop eggs about. Gold-
finches were introduced in 1863; also skylarks,
chaffinches, greenfinches and Indian minahs —re-
markable as peculiarly a city bird. Blackbirds
arrived in 1864. Many others have been tried, but
only thrushes have done at all well.
“Cordex” : A yarn brought in by a party
of Byron Bay (N.S.W.) amateur fishermen about
meeting a wallaby swimming a mile off shore has
been treated as if it were a statement by the German
Ambassador at Washington. I viewed it in that
light myself for a while, but I’ve been convinced
since by professional fishermen that it is no un-
common thing to see wallabies in difficulties in the
surf between Byron Bay and the Brunswick Heads,
where there is a large tract of swamp-heath adjoin-
ing the - beach. They are sure the wallaby is not
chased into the water by dogs, because various people
have followed back the tracks in the sand and found
them normal and leisurely, arid with no sign of dog-
spoor. The theory is that brother wallaby takes a
bath to get rid of vermin.

“Outcast”: The Papuan tribes who
make tappa have less finished methods thgn
those described by “Lagani-Namo” (B. 26/11/’l4) as
current in Samoa and Fiji. The Papuan cloth is
usually beaten out, without previous immersion,
from the bark of the white mulberry, hibiscus or a
species of nettle. ’Stone beaters are occasionally
used in the mountains. The fibre is lambasted until
all the moisture is extracted, and the product is
then hung up in the sun to dry. Decoration is
elaborate, and is always carried out by the women.
The designs are outlined by hand with a brush made
of the fibres of the pandanus flower dipped in char-
coal and water. Variety is added by vegetable dyes
of red, brown and yellow. Red is made by boiling
the twigs of a shrub which I cannot identify; yellow
is made from turmeric.

“GOT-A-FAG.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was tall and tough and stringy, with the
shoulders of an axeman,
Broad and loose, with greenliide muscles, and a
hand shaped to the reins;
He was slow of speech and prudent, something of a
nature student,
With the eye of one who gazes long across the salt-
hush plains.
Smith by name, but long forgotten was his legal
patronymic,
In a land where every bushman wears some un-
baptismal tag;
And, through frequent repetition of a well-worn
. requisition,
“Smith” had long retired in favor of the title,
“Got-a-Fag.”
Not until the war was raging for a month, or may
be longer,
Did the tidings reach the station, blest with quite
< unfrequent mails;
And, though still a steady grafter, Smith grew rest-
. less ever after,
And he pondered long o’ evenings, seated on the
stockyard rails.
Primed with sudden resolution, he arose one summer
morning,
Casually mentioned fighting as he deftly rolled his
swag;
Then, in accents almost hearty, bade his mate, “So
long, old Party!
Goin’ to do some Square-head huntin’. See you
later. Got a fag?”
Six long, sunburned days in saddle, down through
spinifex and saltbush,
Then a two-days’ railroad journey landed him at
last in town,
Charged with an aggressive feeling, heightened by
his forthright dealing
With a shrewd but chastened spieler who had sought
to take him down.
“Smart and stern” describes the war-lord who pre-
sided at recruiting.
To him slouched an apparition, drawling, “Boss, I’ve
got a nag—
Risin’ four. Good prad he’s counted. Better shove
me in the mounted.
Done a little bit o’ shootin’ —gun an’ rifle. Got a
fag?”
Two months later, drilled and kneaded to a shape
approaching martial,
Yet with hints of that lithe looseness discipline can
never kill,
With that keen eye grown yet shrewder, an example
to the cruder,
Private Smith (and, later, Sergeant) stinted speech
and studied drill.
“Smith,” indeed, but briefly served him; for his
former appellation
In its aptness seized the fancy of the regimental
wag,
When an apoplectic colonel gasped, “Of all the dashed
infernal”....
As this Private Smith saluted, with “Ribuck, boss!
Got a fag?”
What he thought, or how he marvelled at the
familiar customs
Of those ancient and historic lands that later
his eyes,
He was never heard to mention; though he voice
one bold contention —
That the absence of wire fences marked a lack of
enterprise.
Soon his shrewd resource, his deftness, won him fame
in many places;
Things he did with wire and whipcord moved his
Company to brag.
And when aught concerning horses called for know-
ledge in the forces
Came a hurried, anxious message: “Hang the vet.!
"* Send Got-a-Fag!”
Tfien, one morning, he was missing, and a soldier
who had seen him
Riding for the foe’s entrenchments bade his mates
abandon hope.
Calm he seemed, but strangely daring; some weird
weapons he was bearing
Built of twisted wire and iron, and a dozen yards of
rope.
la the morn a startled sentry, through the early
morn-mists peering,
Saw a dozen shackled foemen down the sand dunes
slowly drag.
Sore they seemed, and quite dejected, while behind
them, cool, collected,
at a busy sheep-dog, rode their drover,
Got-a-Fag.
To the Colonel’s tent he drove them, brandishing a
stockwhip featly,
Bristly calling, “Heel ’em, Laddie!” While the
warrior of rank
Sniffed, and then exclaimed with loathing: “What’s
this smell of burning clothing?”
Said the drover: “Got ’em branded: ‘A—-Broad
Arrow,’ off-side flank.”
“A, ’ he drawled, “stan’s for Australia, an’ the
Gov’ment brand's in order.
‘Crown—G.R.’ rpon the shoulder marks ’em for the
King an’ flag.
Hoped the blighters same as how we fix the calves
on Kinchacowie.
But it’s dead slow sorter must’rin’,” he concluded.
“Got a fag?”
When the weary war is over, back to his old cattle
station,
If luck holds, he’ll one day journey, casually drop his
swag,
Drawling, “Been up yonder—fightin’.... Not much
doin’. . . .mostly skitin’....
Ci’ me drovin’ for excitement.... Want rain dread-
ful. .. .Got a fag?”
But in that historic country, with its store of
ancient legend,
When they sit to talk at even, and grey beards begin
to wag,
Then amongst traditions hoary they will count the
wondrous story
Of that wild Australian savage known to men as
Got-a-Fag.

HOW I DARKENED MY
GREY HAIR.
Lady Gives Simple Home Recipe That
She Used to Darken Her Grey Hair.
S’or years I tried to restore my grey hair
to its natural color with the prepared dyes
and stains, but none of them gave satisfac-
tion and they were all expensive. I finally
came across a simple recipe which I mixed
at home that gives wonderful results. I gave
the recipe, which is as follows, to a number
of my friends, and they are all delighted
with it: To 7oz. of water add a small box of
Qrlex Compound, loz. of bay rum and a |oz.
•>1 glycerine. Use every other day until the
hh|r becomes the required shade, then every
two weeks. It will not only darken the grey
hair, but removes dandruff and scalp humors,
and acts as a tonic to the hair. It is not
sticky or greasy, does not rub off and does
not color the scalp. You can obtain these
ingredients from your chemist and prepare it
at home at very little expense,* [(5

“Bad Australian” (from Chili) : While
looking over a railway-construction job I stopped
to tear a bone with the man in charge. We were
busy on a cold roast armadillo and some goats’-
milk cheese, when a half-breed 'peon, loaded to the
muzzle, with ca/iia, reeled up, and after a few pre-
liminary remarks regarding the female ancestors of
the company, started to bombard the hospitable
board with ballast. My host immediately “pulled
his gun,” a small-bore automatic, and the invader
went down like the fusion crowd at the last
Federal elections in the land that drove me away.
As he was still alive, he was dumped on a light
engine and started off with another peon to look
after him, said peon being handed five pesos to
defray exes. The nearest settlement was called
by wire and told to have the ambulance to meet
them. Naturally, being in charge of natives, the
ambulance didn’t show up, and nothing further was
hea£d about the pair for two days. Then advice
reached the railhead that the wounded man was in
hosp:i(al, where the bullet had been extracted, anti
his mate was in the calaboose. It appears that when
they? reached town the wounded man had so far re-
covered that lie and his mate went on a jag with
the five pesos, and on being lumbered and over-
hauled the little blue ring on Pedro’s forehead led
-to inquiries and explanations. Pedro was back on
thejjob inside-five days, as well as ever, and nothing
mope was saicl about the incident on either side.
That's what I like about this country; it is always
possible for gentlemen to adjust these little differ-
ences; between themselves. I am still wondering
whether Pedro was the possessor of a phenomenal
skull, or whether the other man was a bad judge
of “guns.”
. * * *• *
“Lagani-Namo”: D’Albertis, who did a
heap of exploring here and there about Papua in
the middle ’7o’s, resorted to all manner of “circus
business” to give the natives the idea that white
folk were invulnerable to spears, arrows and pourri-
pourri. A favorite device of his was to don a suit
of, light steel mail beneath his ordinary garments, ,
and then invite the champion spear-throwers to
do their worst. The nigs hadn’t any doubts thence-
forward about D’Albertis, Some time after he
had gone two other European travellers pitched
camp at Yule Island. One day the natives decided
to ascertain “once and for all” whether this in-
vulnerability was the common attribute of the white
man, so a number of them strolled within easy
range of the visitors, and suddenly hurled their
spears. To their amazement the targets tumbled,
and gore gushed from every spear-hole. When
subsequently arraigned for the murder the accused
protested against punishment, and argued that, any-
how, D Albertis should be held as accessory before
the fact, for having “gammoned” them “too much.”
Ip . was a fair argument, but the Law had other
things to consider.
COUSIN JACK ORATORY.
“Ladies and gentlemen , befoore I start to
spake to 'ee I’d like to say a few words.”
“Tridit”: “Boronia’s” “cobbler” that
stung the tootsies of his pet girl and gave her an
uncomfortable sensation is evidently a relation of
% ! “bull rat” or “bullrout” of N.S.W. eastern
strjeanis. I’ve met this chap (lie’s not nearly good
enough to be called a bloke) on all the fresh-water
rivets from the Hunter to the Tweed. I’ve not yet
run across him in saltwater, but I expect he’s there,
tom! He is a smallish fish, about six inches long,
bufhheaded, tapering to the tail, and covered all
ovMj with small, nobby spikes, any of which can
stijng like the eye teeth of an adder. The fishbeast
resejnbles a gherkin, or pickling cucumber, with a
few ‘ fins erected at intervals. In colpr I’ve seen
hum a slimy green, mottled white, mud brown with
lighter brown spots, and reddish brown with greyish
mottle. The next best antidote to not being stung
is liquid ammonia.
INVIDIOUS.
SHE: "I have been expostulating with my husband about his goings-on; but it's no use
my speaking—he won't be sensible. I wish you would talk to him."
Sandy Blight”: I’ve just finished the
second trip in six months round Ivanhoe, Mossgiel,
Booligal, Hillston, Oxley and Hatfield (N.S.W.).
On the first trip there was water in nearly all the
tanks, a fair amount of motor and horse traffic, and
numerous gates to open and carefully close. But
the second tour—’strewth! We carried water on
the car to help us over the dry patches, 60 to 80
miles wide. In 10 days we saw no traffic —not even
a wheel-mark. We met two swaggies and kindled
their spark of life by quenching their thirst. Out-
lying settlers left their homes months ago. Nearly
every tank was dry and had 6ft. to 10ft. of sand
in it. Troughing from the tanks and 6ft. stakes set
alongside the line on our last trip were completely
covered. The gates that were not left open were
sanded up so that we ran the car right over them.
A bridge that was Bft. above the bottom of a gully
o. n * ri P No - 1 was sanded up so much that "only
six inches of daylight showed beneath it. The pub
at Mossgiel had a high verandah whose floor was
well above the street on our first journev. Now
there is a range of sandhills in the street and a
cutting down to the pub door. We struck a four
days’ dust storm. If we ran off the track we
Pulled up and groped for it on hands and knees. I
thought 1902 was tough, but it was not in the
same class as this lot,'
“Buck”: “Ibis” (B. 18/2/’l5) has his
doubts whether subsoiling- is worth the candle. On
the ground he mentions it certainly was not much
good, but up here on New England (N.S.W.) I
would plump for it nine times out of ten. I did
some about four years ago with a long-handled iron
plough, minus the mould board—and a dog’s job it
was! Now, for about two feet down towards
the nether regions , the ground is still loose. In
fact, on a still night you can hear the gnashing of
teeth and smell the hardened sinner sizzling on the
hob. Young fruit. trees were planted in this soil,
and there’s a big difference between them and
others interned in ground that was not subsoiled.
Gelignite is, however, doing the subsoiler out of a
job. It does better work, and is, I think, cheaper.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko”: Primitive means of
making fire in the South Sea islands have been almost
entirely superseded by the sulphur match. ' Only
where the white man has not penetrated is the old
friction method resorted to. I have sold magnifying
glasses to natives after showing their fire-making
power in collaboration with the sun, and I have seen
brown brother busy with the concave bottom of a
bottle. Also I have seen him use flint and an old
sawfile with a small bit of jackfruit tree pith to
catch the spark; but that dandy was showing off.
Most niggers can make Are both by the “rubbing”'
and the “drilling” stick; but they do it only to
amaze the gaping tourist and the new-comer. New-
comers are whales, for old tricks.
* * *
“Iola” : The Papuan lias bis own methods
of communicating with his brothers in the bush.
The members of a tr?be, of course, generally know
each other’s totems, and should one boy while on
the wallaby wish to let a pal know his whereabouts
he will place a stick on the track pointing in the
direction of his pad, and to that stick will affix his
totem, which in a great many cases is some form
of plant life. In the Chirima valley (Mount Albert
Edward) the nigs when hostile affix a spear upon
a tripod and place it in some conspicuous place,
with the point facing persons coming towards their
village or camping place. To pass that spear point
is to find biff without much delay. Should the point
not be in your direction the office is to follow the
line indicated. This method was used by friendly-
disposed nigs in the early days to advise Govern-
ment patrols of the whereabouts of bad blacks they
were after. In one village (Chirima) an invading
party found that a tribe, due for some hard words
had just cleared, but had left, tied to a pole, some
broken bows, arrows, spears, shields, some young
potato tops, young sugarcane shoots, and a bamboo
smoking pipe, which when read went
like this, “We don’t want to fight; see our broken
weapons. Our food has just recently been planted
as you will observe from the young tops, so don’t
loot our gardens; there is nothing to eat ” The
empty bamboo smoking-pipe, is, of course, a gen-
teel way they have in the Chirima of biting one’s
“X.P.D.”: Prison-warder Peuka, ex-
corporal of the Papuan Armed Constabulary, sta-
tioned at loma, Mamba River, carried an empty
meat-tin about with him, as a preventive of fatal
disease, while directing the labors of the prisoners.
He explained that the utensil was, used as a cus-
pidor for the reception of betel-nut after he, Peuka,
had finished chewing it. If he were to simply
throw away a spent quid, some prisoner who had a
“derry” on him might pick it up and so be armed
with a weapon of sorcery wherewith to insure the
warder or someone belonging to him a bad time.
Peuka’s white officer tried to reason with him, but
the warder held fast to his faith. “If I chewed the
betel-nut only a little,” said he, “they could not
do much harm. But I’m a man who chews his
betel-nut thoroughly, and a pourri-pourri man could
really cause me to die in great pain. So, when
no one is looking, I go out and bury what I’ve
chewed.”

“Boronia” : Jimbill was having a meal at
the school-teacher’s residence. When a basin con-
taining loaf-sugar was pushed across to him he
remarked: “By cripes, mister, the damp muster got
to yer sugar properly! ”
“ VAGUE LONGINGS STIR THE
SOUL!”
“Outcast”: Solomon Island tattooing is
somewhat elaborate, especially in San Christoval.
The patterns are, of course, conventional, and the
favorite ones are these:—Above the nose, a frigate
bird; over the eyebrows, certain lines which repre-
sent the evening sky; beside the eyes, circles which
represent a fruit; on the cheeks, circles which repre-
sent clouds and birds’ wings. When a youngster is
to be tattooed he is tied down firmly and his people’s
friends assemble for tire ceremony, which is per-
formed with the sharp bone of a bat’s wing. When
half the face is done, the patient’s cries are drowned
in a roll of drums, and the same signal announces
the conclusion of the operation, which occupies the
whole day. For weeks afterwards the patient’s face
is like a boiled elephant.

The Overland has the most ad-
vanced electric lighting and starting
system of the two-unit type. Each
unit is more efficient than is a single
unit performing two duties. Ignition
is by high-tension magneto without
batteries, independent of starting and
lighting.
The instruments are most con-
veniently placed in the cowl dash.
The appointments are complete and
of high quality. The Overland is built
in the Willys-Overland factory—the
largest motor-car plant in the world.
Thus we know that every part is made
as perfectly as finest materials, most
expert workmanship and most efficient
machinery can make it.
Intending car purchasers are urged
to see the highly-developed Overland
at the local show-rooms.

“Vera Tasma” : When red tape gets tied
in a knot great is the struggle to make the
tangle worse. Listen! When the Tas.
Government decided to build railways by
day labor not long ago, an engineer in charge
of one of the sections had to purchase three
draught horses. Result, three knock-kneed
brutes driven on to the job, while every
navvy promptly hid as much of a grin as
could be obscured by the flat end of a
shovel. The staff sat round all night dis-
cussing the calamitous quadrupeds with the
engineer, and at last the office genius had
a bright idea about one of the beasts, an
ancient, tottering mare. “Get her in foal,”
he suggested, “and then sell.” So the
engineer kept quiet about his three prads,
turned them out. and arranged for the nup-
tials. Expectations were realised, the sale
took place, and, as the possible loss had been
greatly reduced, the engineer reckoned his
troubles were over. They were only begin-
ning. An account rendered to head office
on behalf of the husband was returned for
explanation. Long report supplied. Ampli-
fication of part of report demanded. More
report sent in. Silence ensued for a time,
while expansive documents passed between
various departmental heads regarding the
“usual practice.” Engineer then written
to asking by what authority, etc. Replied
that he had acted for the best. More letters
to know by what rule he had acted for the
best. Said he couldn’t find any rule—and
so it went on for months. Then when the
afflicted engineer thought the enemy had
been driven from its last place of refuge,
and his hair was beginning to sprout again,
a ponderous envelope arrived from the
Auditor-General inquiring whether an ex-
periment farm was being opened up, and if
not would the officer kindly explain a most
remarkable charge against the public funds?
The poor devil was laboriously writing the
whole story over again when I left.
* * * *
“Dico”: When the perishables-by-post
scheme was loudly introduced last year,
cockies in the Vic. mallee and other con-
sumers of tinned-tack had visions of fresh
fruit and fish. Vanity, vanity! I called
in on old Ned, who keeps a “fruit” shop,
with cigarettes and sausages as side-lines.
There were on view some mortified bananas
and a few saveloys that might have been
brought from Darwin per bullock-waggon;
also some fly- and ant-eaten lollies and a
heavy, warm “hum.” I asked Ned what
fruit he had. “Well, as regards frooot,” he
drawled, “I ’ave only peanuts and onions.”
* * * *
“Late Bird”: A scheme for putting the
odor of saveloys to Christian use behind the
trenches looks like the inspiration of genius.
The notion is to equip a number of adven-
turous curates with pie and coffee stalls,
each joint having a convenient receptacle
for a surplice and other ecclesiastical mil-
linery. Then when Thomas Atkins rushes
up for refreshment the rector in charge,
having handed out cups of sustaining liquid
and pieces of food, will throw off the dis-
guise of a chef, hop into the garb of a
shepherd, and make holy remarks suitable
to such an occasion. The plan is so obvi-
ously capable of adaptation in times of
peace that it might be tried on the lost sheep
of Sydney and Melbourne with great hope
of receiving an encore —provided the coffee
was served out hot and good and the pies
were free.
“Matey”: “Milo” (B. 11/3/T5) says the
manufacture of casein is suffering a terrible
slump at Byron Bay (N.S.W.) owing to the
failure of the German demand, and the
butter-milk from which it should be manu-
factured is being wasted. Where do the
piggeries come in? Surely dairying and
pig-raising go together. And, anyhow, casein
need not absolutely slump. It is highly
nitrogenous, and as nitrogen is very valu-
able as a fertiliser, casein can be used just
the same as sulphate of ammonia, a by-
product of gas manufacture. Ammonia is
largely used on the canefields in Queensland
and produces prolific growth.

A northern N. S. Wales emporium adver-
tises its bargain sale :
Our sale must end on Saturday. Blank and Co.,

After that, no doubt, business, robbery, etc.,

The Repentance of Mr. Bung! While the
combined Sydney publican was recently de-
manding from sixpence to ninepence for a
drink, he found that many an embittered cus-
tomer had cut the bar out of his programme.
The hold-up failed, as first one and then the
other beer-pump reneged. Then it was a
case of Devil take the hindmost, and in the
scramble to get the business back, the best
bill that went up on a bar-front was this: —

“Rag”: Until recently several big North
Queensland firms had their own bank-notes
or shin-plasters, and thousands of pounds’
worth of the flimsies were in circulation.
It was a fine thing for the firms, because
their hard cash could be used for something
else. Also, when a fire or any other acci-
dent destroyed the notes, the firm that issued
them was that much to the good. One well-
known house must have made a nice dry bit
in this way in Papua and other South Sea
Isles. An artful German in Papua had a
set of dies, with which he made iron and
copper “tokens.” Whatever native pro-
ducts he bought were paid for with these,
and, since no other Europeans would recog-
nise them, the nigs had perforce to spend
them at his store. He was one of the
maddest men I’ve ever seen when one day
I dropped in on him with £3 of his metal
and demanded coin of the realm.
“Y.Z.” : My friend the professional beggar
tells me a further tale. “I’d like to damn
the war, if you don’t mind,” he said. “I
ain’t been able to collect more’n tenpence
in three weeks all along of these infernal
amachoors. The blessed place is choked
wfith ’em. Cadgers fer all sorts of funds fer
destichoot foreigners is swarmin’ and the
local poorenflicted ain’t got a show. All the
small money’s goin’ out o’ the country. Look
et me. I got one leg ’n’ two-thirds of a
hand, an’ when I appeals fer aid people
rounds on me, ’n’ tells me I ought t’ be
cursed well ashamed of myself to be beggin’
for myself, knowin’ the state the poor Bel-
jims is in. I’m now collectin’ fer a fund t’
send me t’ Beljum; but, gordelfius, I ain’t
got a dorg show!”
“Hamer” on a sinful business: —
A word about the sale of “businesses” and “part-
nerships” should follow The Bulletin’s warning
with regard to time-payment house-bargains. This
method of securing a crust has for years attracted
the activities of a gang of ramps and dodgers whose
unscrupulous methods are entirely without limitation.
There are always a number of poor simpletons who
for the sake of the job that is getting no more
plentiful are willing to part with their savings, and
it is on these inexperienced people—widows often
enough, sometimes men in broken health —that the
“commercial agency” with an obscure office and a
contingent of beery touts finds sustenance. The
plight of the man or woman who buys one of the
“businesses” peddled by these unclean rascals is one
of abject pathos. The purchaser enters into posses-
sion and stands around waiting for customers who
never come; drops into arrears with the rent, and
finally finds himself out in the street with neither
“business” nor home. One firm has or had a habit
of establishing, “businesses” by hiring a room and
hurling some cheap furniture in. It was provided
with various articles for sale, and advertisements
were published offering jobs to canvassers to sell the
goods. Of course as long as the canvassers’ boots
held out a certain amount of trade was done, and
on the strength of this the “business” was sold to
some trustful customer buttonholed by an ingratiat-
ing scout. It may be said, of course, that anyone
who buys a business without hearing what an
accountant has to say about it is raving mad. Maybe ;
but even the demented have a moral right to pro-
tection.
* * * *
“Askeaton” : If Holman’s scheme for mak-
ing a bushel of wheat grow at Trangie
where only a rabbit grew before proves a
gigantic failure this year, it will still have
been remarkable in other ways. It will, for
instance, have provided a free railway ride
to any unemployed in Sydney who wanted to
watch a Government loan getting through a
rabbit-proof fence. Men have been raked
together all over Sydney and sent up
scrub-clearing on the wheat area. They
are not told the price they are to receive till
they arrive on the scene of action. Then they
look at the pine, the rabbits and the dust,
and the more they look the more they want
to get back to Sydney again. Many blocks
have acres of real good trees, averaging 60
to the acre —pines much straighter than
the politicians who say a man shall be paid
4d. each for pushing the big herbs down and
burning them.

“Pick”: The tanning properties of blood-
wood and mangrove bark are not so little
known in Australia as “Vigilans” (B.
4/3/T5) seems to think, although, as com-
pared with wattle bark, their present mar-
ket values are practically nil. Likewise,
the bark of native hickory, she-oak, maiden’s
blush and dozens of others have astringent
qualities more or less. For certain specific
purposes the bark of the geebung is, how-
ever, the best of them all. It doesn’t burn
like wattle bark, and is the most suitable
tanning product our bush affords for lines,
cordage and fishing nets. When it can be
got in sufficient quantity, it is also the fav-
orite of rug-makers because of. the silky
softness and delicate pink color it gives to
skins.

And now across the Frozen Seas
The fortune-hunters’ eyes
Will see in dreams by swift degrees
This snow-strewn Paradise.
And from the sunlands of the North
The restless ones will follow forth
Where El Dorado lies.
The North will suddenly grow stale,
A place of scanty worth
To those who take the wander-trail
Through all the lands of earth.
And through the stinging of the snow
The Eldoraiders soon will go,
Unminding breed or birth.
The long-haired dogs will draw the sledge
Across the frozen waste;
And southward to the Furthest Edge
The lean brown men will haste;
The good and bad of northern years,
Unhaloed saints and buccaneers —
The diamonds and the paste!
The weaker men, the stronger men,
The men no land may please,
Will do the Scott heroics then
(Unhelped by sympathies
Poured out from ev’ry nation’s press)
Down there amidst the loneliness
Beyond the Frozen Seas.
Nonentities of low degree
And wastrels ready-made
Shall follow trails of misery,
And never be afraid ;
For strong within their breasts shall beat
The valiant hearts that daunt defeat —
Adventurers by trade.
This hotch-potch of humanity,
These men of no abode
Shall take whatever they can see,
So long as it’s a road.
And if there are no roads to take,
Then they new roads shall swiftly make —-
With Gold their god and goad.
The sun shall glimmer in their wake,
The Northern Stars grow pale,
When southern blizzards wrap and shake
The canvas by the trail.
And heroes deaf to War’s loud drum
Will hear the sii'en voice say “Come!”—
The whisper in the gale.

One of the worst results of dyspepsia and stomach troubles is
loss of appetite. You must eat to live, and if you begin to feel you
can’t eat, bad times are coming unless you begin quickly to take
Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver —they restore
appetite and relieve stomach troubles.
It is of the most vital importance to you that you do not allow
dyspepsia, stomach or liver troubles to get a firm hold on you, for
they will surely shorten your life.
The one remedy which is guaranteed to increase the flow of
bile, purify the blood, strengthen the stomach, tone up the whole
digestive apparatus and give you a relish for your meals is

TAKES THE FAT OFF!

LET US SEND YOU A FREE SAMPLE.
QVOrfclt Excess fat injures your health, impedes
P . your movements, and makes you the
®OP*©butt of your unfeeling, normal-weight
friends. People who are excessively fat never feel
well and vigorous like normal folks. You know this
is true. People who have been fat, and are now re-
duced to normal, think other people ridiculous.
Excess fat also impedes the heart action, rendering
the functions difficult, and interferes with the breath-
ing. Not alone does excess fat injure your health
and endanger your existence, it absolutely destroys
your figure and makes you a ludicrous sight. Why
do you stay fat?
“TI-SARRIN ”
positively removes excess fat and will restore your
spoiled figure to decent and pleasing proportions;
it is always a sure and lasting cure for obesity and
corpulency. A few doses improves your breathing
wonderfully, and the course of treatment will cure
you. It is the only successful and, at the same
time, harmless fat-reducer that has ever been dis-
covered. Its efficacy has been undeniably demon-
strated in thousands of successfully treated cases.
It is totally and absolutely non-poisonous, and can
in no wise work any injury to the general health,
even though it often reduces excess of weight by as
much as a pound a day. On the contrary, improved
conditions in the general health become noticeable in
less than a week after its use is begun.
“TI-SARKIN” is not a patent pill sold regardless
of individual symptoms, but it is a scientific treatment
in each special case. Obesity cannot he cured by
drastic purging pills. They invariably injure.
Manager, Watworth Co. Cuprona, Tas.
Bear Sir, —In replying to your kind inquiry as to the
permanency of my reduction from the use of “Ti-sarkin” I am
pleased to tell you that the results are far more satisfactory
than I ever anticipated they could possibly he. “Ti-sarkin” has
produced a wonderful improvement in my health and condi-
tion. When I began its use I weighed 13st. 31b., and I began
to lose weight after the first few doses, and continued rapidly
for the next three months, by which time I was quite satisfied
that I was thin enough, having lovt a stone a month. Before
taking “Ti-sarkin” my wor,i was always a burden, but since my
reduction it is just the reverse, and now I am able to take real
pleasure and interest in all about me. My friends all marvel
at my rapid loss of weight and vast improvement in my,
general health. They say they can scarcely believe their eyes,'
and they, as well as myself, feel very pleased, and your:
methods gained many warm advocates from the success in
my case.
I hope that many faltering women whose excess weight is
a burden to them, will be convinced by my experience, and my
earnest advice to all my fat friends is to have a course. Now I
eat heartily and enjoy my food, and find no cause whatever
for complaint.
You are at liberty to make whatever use you may choose
of this letter. Yours sincerely,
(Signed) Mrs. A. CARR.
It does not matter how far away you live, we
can treat you and reduce you successfully by
post. We want you to see what hundreds say
of “Ti-sarkin” after using it. We want you to

WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENT.
STOMACH AND THREAD WORMS EX-
PELLED BY COMSTOCK’S “DEAD
SHOT” WORM PELLETS. AFTER
MEDICAL TREATMENT FAILED.
Still another instance of the efficacy of
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets is
the case of Nell Brett, whose mother de-
scribes in the following statement how this
little girl was unsuccessfully treated by
several doctors, but that, after taking half a
tube of Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm
Pellets, she passed a quantity of both
stomach and thread worms.
Mrs. J. W. Brett, of Van Diemen’s Land
Terrace, Wellington Street, South Burnie,
Tas., writes: “My little daughter Nell,
three years of age. was treated with Com-
stock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets, as she
was troubled with worms. After taking
about half a tube of worm pellets I was
astonished at the number of worms she
passed, about eight in all, comprising
stomach worms, measuring from 4\ to 10|
inches in length. She also passed a number
of thread worms. I had my child under
several doctors, and after much treatment
proved of no avail. As a last resort vour
great remedy, as stated above, accomplished
the work most successfully. You may use
this testimony for publication.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation
for the eradication of worms in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers, price 3s. 6d. per packet, or six
packets for 205.; or will be sent post paid at
the same price by The W. 11. Comstock Co.,

POLITICAL
POINTS
Hoyle, Assistant Treasurer of N. S.
Wales, leaves on April 11 to look at the
places along the coast north and south of
Sydney from which ocean trade is excluded.
Ilis mission is apparently to see if any of the
inlets require a boom across them to close
them more effectively. Anyhow, there is a
proposal to hand over all the ports south of
Port Jackson to the Sydney Harbor Trust
and to constitute a similar trust at New-
castle to deal with those north of the great
coalscuttle; and while Sydney and New-
castle boss the rest of the coast, the chance
for any scheme of decentralisation isn’t pro-
mising.
What is to become of Geo. Reid when he
has abandoned his present glad eminence as
Pie Commissioner? There is a suspicion
that, one Jo Cook is making anxious in-
quiries. A while ago George was heard to
lament that, although a Cook had discovered
Australia, Australia had not yet discovered
a cook worth mentioning. Joseph is said
to be wondering whether Reid’s cryptic
observation was gastronomic or merely
political.
My theory is that the wowser
and the Socialist are individuals of the
same class operating in different mental
spheres. The wowser wants State oversight
of morals and his business left alone. The
Socialist wants State oversight of business
and his morals left alone. They are equally
vociferous in enlightening the world as to
the one and only path to salvation. Unfor-
tunately for their good endeavors, they re-
present the opposite ends of a see-saw. The
general public is merely the log the plank
balances on.
THE TORTOISE SETS OUT FROM
ADELAIDE ON A TOUR OF AUS-
TRALIA.
In attempting to explain the extravagant
price paid by the Government for 30,000
quarters of beef requisitioned by the British
War Office a N.S.AV. Minister (Flowers)
said: “It would have been an everlasting
disgrace if we had said to exporters that
they should put no more meat into store
until they had supplied all we want at our
own price.” Well, this is the same Minis-
try which said to the wheat men a few

stirs up an unsavory smell when lie
discourses on the stability or seaworthiness
of the Federal trawler. The effluvium ap-
pears to have been always there; but the
official nose did not allow that any odor
except attar of roses was about. Now
the Queensland Marine Board is asked to
analyse the smell and furnish a report. You
ask. Why Queensland? Well, probably
because Queensland is the State furthest
tiom V ictoria, the habitat of men who might
reel inclined to tell unpleasant tales, or
because the Q.M.B. is a somnolent body less
liable than any other to locate decayed
matter, and therefore not very likely to dis-
cover the shortcomings of the Federal yacht.
On the face of it, it isn’t a creditable busi-
ness, and seems to suggest that the Govern-
ment is desperately anxious to get some sort
of a report to justify it in treating meanly
the dependents of the lost crew.

Customs Minister Tudor has promised a
deputation of orchardists to favorably con-
sider the question of placing a stiff duty on
canned fruits. The application was urged
on the ground that California had placed
an embargo on the im-
portation of fruit. But
that doesn’t matter.
The quite sufficient
reason is that the

fruit-canning indus-

“Quineecha” : If this is not a farce I don’t
know what is! At the recent elections in
Aus. there was a referendum regarding
the earlier closing of liquor bars. Now
the abos. on Point Pierce mission station are
franchised, but the supplying of intoxicating
liquor to them is unlawful. Also any Binghi
found in hotel bars or parlors is liable to
imprisonment. In spite of this they were
allowed to vote on the referendum. Prob-
ably their votes didn’t affect the result, as
the six o’clockers had a thumping lead. But
that doesn’t make it any less a farce
that people debarred from entrance to bars
should have a say as to what hours those
bars should be open.
Attorney-General Hughes is a busy man
these days. Prosecutions ■ have just
been begun against four Sydney mer-
chants who are charged with trading with
the enemy, and nearly a score other cases
are under consideration. Thus is Hughes
paying for his own old offences. If
he hadn’t given so much encouragement to
the importer in times of peace, the relations
of the importers with their foreign houses
wouldn’t have given him so much trouble
in times of war.
Under a N. S. Wales Local Government
regulation the clerk to a council whose income
exceeds £lOOO per annum must hold a cer-
tificate under the Act, the idea being that
at least one person on the premises shall
know his business. Some of the councils
persist in evading the regulation, either be-
cause they are hungry to pay sweating wages,
or because some influential alderman wants
a job for a friend. They can make a tem-
porary appointment, “in case of emergency,”
for three months, and some of them continue
the appointment for several three-months.
At these the Local Government Clerks’ Asso-
ciation has now hurled a boihb. It
declares that notices issued by a council can-
not be valid in law unless they are signed
by an officer duly appointed under the Act
to do that business; and as these “tem-
porary” clerks are not duly appointed there
are three army corps of aldermen who are
arguing frantically about the rate notices
that have been issued at various times.
The N.S.W. Amending Health Act, which
has just come into operation, will discipline
many a i ax municipal and shire council,
should a council be slow in doing anything
that the Health Board ; con-
siders necessary to save the
Public from infection or disease,
the Board can tear in and have
the necessary work performed
at the Council’s expense. The
Health authorities may also iso-
late cases of small-pox, plague
and cholera. Hitherto this
power extended only to Federal
officers in respect to quaran-
tine.
According to the garrulous
Griffith, Minister for Works in
N.S.W. until he was lately
shifted _ and told to look after
Education, the unification of
the railway gauges < f Australia
would be the “least justifiable
use to which public money could
be placed,” and ought “not to
be seriously considered.” This
is the hardy battler whose
muddlings with brick and lime
works and other things have
made of public enterprise in the
State a shrieking jest; whose
calamitous calico shacks deface
the landscape near Botany ; who
is under suspicion of having
plunged the State into enormous
losses over a Sydney sawmill
and joinery works; who has
flung away on wasteful railway
construction and other works hundreds of
thousands of Cohen’s hard-earned money.
Griffith also calls himself a “Labor” man ;
and as unification of gauge is one of the
main planks of the party’s Federal pro-
gramme, he seems to be a stalwart of great
nerve and thoroughness.
While tens of thousands of animals are
dying of starvation in Victoria, thousands of
tons of hay and chaff are held up at Albury
on the N. S. Wales side through the conges-
tion caused by the different gauges. In
fact, the yards at the border town were so
blocked that on March 10 the S.M. notified
that he would accept no more such goods
until March 29. It was during this period
that Fisher burred about a “strategic” rail-
way from Nowhere-in-Particular to his own
back yard, while Griffith asked scornfully
what a few minutes’ delay at Albury and
Wallangarra mattered.
Lloyd George is gaining the necessary
courage to break off diplomatic relations
with Bung. He admitted last week to “a
growing conviction that nothing but root
and branch methods were of the slightest
avail in dealing with drink.” Conviction
grew rapidly enough in Russia and France,
but how long' the plant will take to arrive at
legislative maturity in George’s land the
British Beerage only knows.
Confronted at a public dinner last week
in Sydney with a cable message stating that

George Reid’s knife and fork. Andrew
Fisher lost his block. One interviewer was
told that “lie didn’t care whether they
played bagpipes” and another that “it was
a d—d scandal to use the press in this
way,” and he wasn’t going to have his leg
pulled. Asked to explain this outburst about
prehistoric musical instruments when a
simple yes or no would meet the case, the
infuriated Andrew remarked “Bah!” and
turned to eat again. How is it that every-
thing connected with the High Commis-
sionership of this young nation centres in
Food?

Clem Hack, a fugleman of the A.N.A. in
Victoria, stands up in that Protectionist
body for the antique in Freetrade notions.
Says he: “We are not at war with indus-
trial Germany but only with the Junkers.”
The truth is that we have been at war with
industrial Germany all the time, and only
began to fight the Junkers last August. But
the most important thing to nail in our
heads is that under our fiscal system Ger-
many has been winning steadily for 20
years. England discovered the aniline dyes,
and Germany snatched them under glorious
Freetrade; then it slaughtered the British
electrical trade, the glass and porcelain
industries, and many others once profitable.
The fight now. put up by Germany was
only made possible by victories in the long

but with all its wealth of raw material.

In spite of the castigation they suffered for
their recent turning down of an Australian
tender for machinery in favor of imported,
one of their pestilent committees reported
in favor of buying an imported, instead of
a locally-made pump—a common boiler-feed
pump—because of an apparent saving of
£l9 in about £lOO. But the Council, having
to decide the matter openly, wouldn’t sup-
port the anti-Australian policy, and referred
back the recommendation. What is the
inducement for this perpetual barracking for
the importer in camera?

I sought out Peace, for she had flown
From ken of men, it seemed to me,
Beyond the livid fighting zone
To some green, lisping, distant lee.
She was not in the ranges fair,
For there the iron mortars frown.
She was not in the clouded air,
The airmen fierce had caught her there,
And with their guns had brought her down.
She was not in the city shops,
Where,' gaunt men mouthed their bitterness ;
Nor in the fields that grew no crops
But dead men, grey and numberless.
I sought in vain the ocean wide
Where submarines their murder slip...,
I found her nested, dreamy-eved,
Soft cradled by the Baltic tide,
On William’s biggest battleship!

IN MEMORIAN.
Joiixson. —In memory of our well-begloved brucl-
dev Jack, who gave lip the ghost (may it never walk
again for him) after an over-helping of unboned
aowhov, at Havana (Cuba), on April 5, 1915, aged
37.
We shall meet, but we shall miss him
From his angle in the square,
No more will the fans caress him —-
Jack’s is sure a vacant chair.
» Once more the heavyweight championship of the
world has changed hands, and this time the hands
that hold it are white. It happened at Havana, in
Cuba, on Easter Monday, the scene of operations
having been transferred from Juarez (Mexico) on
account of unpleasantness with somebody apparently
i(i .'authority there for the time being. The oblitera-
ter of Jack Johnson, Jess Willard, is a Kansas
lighter of the cowboy breed, with a dull record.
Many good judges opined that, even throwing in the
black's age and lack of care of himself, the white
naan had contracted for the impossible. On the
other hand, Jack Curley, the promoter of the fight,
hhd no doubt about Willard winning. lie backed
him heavily. In the 25th round Willard, a much
fresher and stronger man than his big opponent,
dropped Johnson to one knee with a smash on the
mouth. That settled it. The black came out a sick man
for, the 26tli, Willard hit him a terrific blow as he
broke away from a clinch, and Massa went to the
qold, cold ground.
, Jess Willard is 28 j'ears of age, Oft. 7in. in
height, and fights down to about 2281b. The best
man he fought before defeating Johnson was Gun-
boat Smith, two years ago. The naval party won in
20 rounds. Johnson is 37 years old, 6ft. 0]in. in
height, and weighs 1951b.
Les Darcy amused himself punching Ileuri
Demlin for four rounds at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day evening, and was working hard on the same job
in the fifth when a demonstration with the towel
in the Belgian's corner caused the referee to tear the
belligerents apart. From no point of view had the
lhatch anything to commend it, and the exhibition
was quite as sorry as most people expected. Demlin
could neither box nor fight his more speedy and
powerful opponent, and from the outset was a mere
popping block. He averted the full consequences
Jf Darcy’s greater skill with some success for a couple
of rounds by hanging on and smothering, but after
that was clearly demoralised. Darcy has some claims
. v to be considered of Championship class, and can
therefore be more usefully employed than battering
men of lesser calibre. He can probably get as
much of this kind of exercise in private as is neces-
sary to keep him healthy ; and in anv case, if he is
good enough to put in the ring with men like Jeff
Smith, Mick King and Fritz Holland, he is too good
to publicly put third-raters up against, be they ever
io plucky.
Hardwick and Mick King argued the
point over 20 rounds at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day, and Hardwick got the verdict. Several of the
rounds were inexpressibly dreary, but some were
good to watch, and in the sixteenth the tension was
so acute that the crowd was moved to the wildest
cheering. King showed himself just as quick and
Ineffective a boxer as ever. Had be been able to
hit with even reasonable force, the bigger man
would have gone out, for at close quarters the
middleweight had much the best of things, and
landed many a disturbing smack —but that’s all
they were. Hardwick has improved since meeting
O’Donnell. At times he boxed very well, but it was
only when lie went in and fought that he had a
really marked advantage. On these occasions King
got badly handled. Hardwick missed many chances
of annihilation with his right, and will have to im-
prove his method of using that weapon to do any
good with it.
Brisbane pug patrons got one more help-
ing of hard metal for their pelf on Saturday night,
when abo. Jerry Jerome was plunked up against Les
Q’Donnell. When the gong said “Go!” Jeremiah
hurled all the bones he had in both hands against
his learned friend’s countenance. This tended to
make his learned friend very cautious, and urged
him to take no familiarities in Jeremiah’s vicinity.
In the second round black brother suddenly lashed
low, or appeared to. Anyhow, down went O’Donnell
as if in great pain, and the referee ushered Jeremiah
out of the ring after fully one and a half rounds of
assault. On Monday Hector Melville sought to tear
the Australian featherweight laurels from Jimmy
If ill. He thought better of it at the close of the
sixth round, and flagged surrender.
At Perth on Saturday uiglit IIis Majesty’s
Theatre bulged with the crowd that poured in to
encourage- Alt' Morey (Vic.) and Fred Kay (IV.A.) to
eat each other according to the etiquette of the
Marquis of Queensberry, The proceedings went the
ftill 20 rounds, and the local bone-trader won on
points. He had his meal well in hand from the
sixth round when he dashed it to the floor for eight
seconds.
j * * * *
| At the first day of the A..J.C. Autumn
Meeting at Rand wick on Saturday the favorite won
id three and went down with a tlujd in three. As
usual, the public tolerated absurdly short prices, and
though the ring moaned with familiar nasal bitter-
n|;ss about losses on the day, the bagmen went home
bearing their usual burden of plunder. With the
pjiblic taking odds of 2, 4, 5, 6 and" 7 to 1 in a
1,0-horse hurdle race, the chances of anyone winning
except McNoses are about as remote a contingency
ds the Kaiser backing the winner of the next Mel-
bourne Cup..
. On Saturday a regiment of reckless individuals
took 2’s about Clontaft, and then had the pleasure
qf witnessing the leniently-treated Hallmark win all
the way. ’Twas a bad beginning, but the cheerful
pjlnter at once proceeded to take evens about Ulva’s
I|le for the Autumn Stakes, and again immersed
himself in the soup. This race afforded a painful
illustration of the difference between the tote and
the bookmaker. Given an even-money favorite on the
machine and the third favorite winning, as was the
else here, then if the number of investors bore the
same relation to the total as the betting odds indi-
cate in this race, the dividend would be in the
vScinity of £20. The yield derived fronv the philan-
thropist with a loud voice and a bag was £7 or
8. Further, on the totalisator, dividends of £120
would have been possible. Ikey wasn’t doing any-
thing like that.
With 32 horses running, Bar Von and Co. could
afford to view with satisfaction the rush to pick the
winner of the Doncaster. For Woorak, already
heavily backed, money came along in shovelsful, and
at the close the best price on offer was 6’«, with
Garlin and Portrush at B’s. Giru was on sale at
12, Imshi at 14, Traquette, Hush Money and Amata
at 16, Brattle 100 to 2 and 3. The public got it in
the neck again with emphasis. Woorak, Portrush
and Giru carried the great weight of punters’ cash ;
the support for Garlin came in the main from the
stable connection and friends. All of which merely
gives further point to a very ancient moral, for
woorak, Portrush and Giru turned out to be rather
less reliable than politicians. Garlin won with
something in hand, the neglected Spurn conducting
him to the post. The time (lmin. 39sec.) shows
only three-quarters worse than Broadsword’s record,
and coupled with Garlin s win at Hawkesbury makes
him out a rattling good miler.
For Woorak’s display there is only this to be said
-—that he got well away, ran in the lead or there-
abouts for six and a half furlongs, and then refused
to come on. The suspicion that the liberally-white-
washed son of Traquair is an arrant rogue is not
likely to be much disturbed by this exhibition. He
won’t gallop under pressure. As soon as Garlin and
Spurn came at him he shut up like a knife. Traquette
ran clean over him, and moved like a racehorse. Her
position (fifth) was, under all the circumstances, dis-
tinctly creditable.
Garlin, who notched his second win for John Wren,
cost that enterprising person 2000 of the best, but as
a yearling was secured for 80. In last Caulfield Cup
lie finished seventh with a feather-weight, was then
spelled for a while and prior to winning the Welter
Mile at Hawkesbury, ran last in the Rawson Stakes
at Rosehill. Wren threw in for a good win and
landed the bacon on his birthday. It was such a
good, fat piece that he handed over the stake
( £2125) to the Belgian Fund.
Giru, greatly fancied by his connections and
favored bv many shrewd judges of track work, ran
like a carthorse. Brattle and Spurn both showed
a surprising turn of speed. Portrush had a look in
at the proceedings near the turn for a moment or
two, but quickly decided that it was no place for
him.
Ulva’s Isle, for a long time favorite for the Cup,
went out a strong order for the Autumn Stakes, a
mile and a half. Five to four was the best price on
offer, but evens had been freely taken. Sir Alwynton,
starting at sevens, ran in a rather easy winner. The
gelding, who had been trying to jump out of his
skin in the paddock, was never started in better
condition. He ran a good honest race throughout,
and won with a good deal more to spare than was
represented by the difference in the Cup weights
between him and Ulva’s Isle. It was just doubtful,
however, whether the trial was quite conclusive.
Ulva’s Isle appeared to be taking things rather too
leisurely at the start. St. Spasa’s third could hardlv
be taken as an indication of anything great to come.
HOOD, Sydney Cup winner.
Cetigne won the rich Sires’ Produce Stakes in such
workmanlike style that he must be regarded as quite
the best of the youngsters. Lying handy throughout,
the colt soon got rid of Two coming down the straight,
and the length and a half by which he won from
Westcourt, who arrived late, might under greater
stress have been increased. Two had every oppor-
tunity of asserting himself, but seemed to have had
enough. Never having won before over a greater
distance than five furlongs, some doubts were felt
about Cetigne being able to get the additional quar-
ter of a mile. The gallop showed that these tears
were without justification. Red Signal, who, after win-
ning the Maribyrnong Plate (live furlongs), had won
over six furlongs in the V.R.C. February Sires’ Produce
Stakes, was solidly backed by the Victorian contin-
gent. The showing he made was not impressive.
After being upsides with Cetigne and Two for three-
parts of the journey he left the issue to be decided
by others. Two was tiring badly at the end.
Cetigne stayed it out manfully.
Mountain Knight had an easy job to settle Carlita
in the St. Leger, and Silver Lad had the Welter won
in a field of 30 at the turn.
On Saturday four races went to the sons of im-
ported sires. In the other two events the seconds
were the progeny of animals brought over-sea.
It was understood in Melbourne a month
ago that John Wren had backed Garlin for the
Doncaster Handicap, to win him more than he
netted bv the Caulfield Cup victory of Murmur in
1904. Anyhow, the Garlin coup is his biggest thing
since then. His luck with expensive gee-gees—
notably in the ease of Solution —has been pretty
, rotten, meantime.
Sydney Cup was a procession. Scotch
Artillery (7st. 211).) hopped to the front, stayed
there with sometimes a gap of 20 yards between him
and the next, and, though tiring at every stride,
lasted out long enough to stave off a determined
challenge by the Queensland candidate Frasca. Cer-
tain, apparently, of his mount’s ability to stay,
Flood rode a good race. Some of the other: horse-
men judged the pace rather badly, and delayed until
it was too late, under the impression that the leader
would come back. Frasca might have been brought
within striking distance earlier; and Onazer, too,
could with advantage have been asked to move up
sooner. Frasca’s run down the straight was well
worth going to see. He galloped with the greatest
resolution, and with a couple of lengths further to
go would have won. To the ring the finish was a
grateful spectacle. Neither horse had been backed
except for a relatively small amount. Ulva’s Isle
and St. Spasa, both solidly supported, were hopelessly
beaten; Moonbria, the favorite, had broken down —
and most of the double books revealed a skinner.
\H 0 f the moderately well-backed horses on the
day stood coupled with Garlin on the Doncaster
and Cup—and not one of them had a look in. Ikey
felt once more that the world was a good place to
live in. Scotch Artillery was backed a little at
20 and 16. With a totalisator he would have paid
the best part of a century.
Woorak again let his friends down —this time in
the Flying. He had his nose in front turning into
the straight, but as soon as the pace began to im-
prove he declined the invitation to move along, and
finished in the ruck. Traquette (9st. 51b.) was a
good fourth. Spurn and Amata ran disappointingly ;
and Brattle, who made such a good showing in the
Doncaster, found 9st. a steadier after running well
for five furlongs.
Two had a runaway win in the Champagne Stakes
of six furlongs, the distance and heavy going being
both acceptable. Cetigne had a bad passage. Mr.
Clarke’s colt is likely to develop into a more than
ordinarily smart sprinter. A hot favorite went down
cn Icon "in the Steeplechase after being backed at
2’s. The field was taken along at a great bat by
Home Rule, who faded out in the last half-mile, and
finished in record time, with the old familiar Miser
shepherding the homeward run from far behind.
In all six races the favorite was beaten, and
except in one event the animal next in public
demand failed. The winners started at B’s, B’s, 16’s,
6’s, 25’s and 7’s. Ikey went home at peace with
all mankind.
“0.K.”: A Melbourne paper lately threw
out the iin-portsmanlike suggestion -that amateur
jockeys should be debarred from riding among- pro-
fessionals, on the ground that they are “encroaching
on the livelihood of our professional horsemen and
gaining an experience which the really sporting-
amateur denies himself for more reasons than one.”
Also, the strenuous reformer asserted that in all other
branches of sport an amateur loses his status if he
competes among professionals. He was forgetting
cricket, in which wealthy amateurs have always
played among the best professionals and have cap-
tained the best teams. As a matter of fact, an
enthusiastic “gentleman” jock, riding his own horse
in a steeplechase—such as, say, Claude Grice on
Swedish Lad —is the most truly sporting feature of
a race meeting on a metropolitan course. He is the
one owner of a competing nag who can depend on his
jockey. And if he is up on another man’s horse
what’s the objection to his risking his life in the
way of recreation and glory, rather than in an
ordinary way of business? Supposing- an amateur to
be less expert and more cautious than the profes-
sionals he is bunched with, why shouldn’t he go
to the best school of experience to gain confidence?
He is subject to the same racing authorities as the
pro., and there is a better guarantee of his honesty
in the facts that (1) he must he a real enthusiast
to have taken on the game, and (2) if he is riding
to lose he probably can’t pull the horse or fall off
it intentionally without making his dishonesty appar-
ent to all observers. An amateur is the more likely
to be a trier always because he doesn’t earn his
living by riding to orders, and the pity is that he
rarely, if ever, is small enough and sufficiently
expert to be given a mount among professionals in
flat races. There would be fewer swindling coups
if he was.
The promise of the totalisator in N. S.
Wales has brought another squeak in favor of the
betting monopoly. The other day, the Clerks’ Union
protested that the wiping out of the “books” would
cast between 1000 and 1500 clerks on the sea of
unemployment. Which, no doubt, is quite possible.
Still, it’s a poor- choice to offer of two evils. Much
unemployment followed the suppression of the betting
shops, and a lot of bullock-drivers were thrown out
of a job when railways were invented. But that
wasn’t considered good enough reason for hanging
on to bullock waggons.
That game and dexterous horsewoman,
Mrs. K. M. Stace, topped a fire show-ring career at
Sydney Agricultural Ground on Easter Monday by
lifting her mount, Emu Plains, over the 6ft. 6in.
bar at the first attempt. Another gallant rider,
M'iss Myra Smith, put Bandolier over the stick at
the second attempt. As far as the records show,
these arc world’s figures for a horse navigated by a
lady, and the performance is the more meritorious
because of the fact that, owing to rain, the take-off
was deplorable. Only two riders in the competition
escaped a fall. The previous record was 6ft. sin.,
by Rattler, ridden by Miss Folev, at Cunnedah
(N.S.W.), in 1908.

The recent passing of Lord Londonderry
revives a weird happening at the Curragh (Ireland)
racecourse in 1910 wherein his prad, St. Dunstan,
figured. This horse was one of three starters in a
race which he won, but for which he was disquali-
fied. The second horse was navigated by a jockey
who could not comply with the conditions of the
race, so that settled two of them. The third boast
settled himself. He collided with a post and dropped
dead.

Another cricket freak. In a match at
Bathurst (N.S.W.) the other day two bowlers named
A. Brooker and IV. Wood cleaned out the opposition
in the first innings for 10 runs. Brooker’s tally was
seven for two, and Wood’s four for seven. In the
second innings the former howler got nine for 16
in a total of 55. As his side knocked up 71 runs
at its first batting it won by an innings and six
runs.
A. E. Stoddart, who decided to go West
with the aid of a pistol bullet in London this week,
was in his time one of England’s finest players of
cricket and football. Australasia knew him well in
both games, and his name as a good sport is guaran-
teed over the Commonwealth and Maoriland. He was
52 when depression, cahsed by financial difficulties
bi ought about by the war, got him down.
Coach J. N. Crawford’s Colts annexed
the cricket championship of Dunedin (M.L.). They
went right through the season without being de-
feated, playing 17 matches, winning 14 outright and
drawing three. It was a great performance, and the
tail of the cricketing youth of the city of whusky
and haggis is mightily exalted these day?:
A really sporting event, played right under
the shadow of the tomb of Cheops, was a lacrosse
match between South Aus. and (Queensland. It was
the more interesting because all the tools of the game
—bar the goal posts, which were manufactured on
the spot —were lent try a Territorial regiment from
Manchester. That happens to be the stronghold of
lacrosse in Britain, and the Lancashire men, an-
nouncing that 60 players had enlisted in a body and
they could command practically an all-England team,
were anxious to take on all Australia. The above-
named match was the first attempt towards selecting
a test match XII. South Aus. won it comfortably.

The latest communique concerning the
suggested race between Felton and Charlie Towns is
that the latter sculler has accumulated the stipu-
lated stake of £2OO, and will get busy as soon as
Felton blushes an assent. Richard Arnst, also, who
has been churning up and down the Parramatta
for some hitherto-obscure reason, has notified the
Consul for Maoriland that he intends to further per-
plex the mind of William Webb with a challenge to
row him on Sydney’s classic stretch of water for
£250. Arnst offers £5O to the other old stager by
way of expenses or bait or something.
The N. S. Wales skiff championship money
was collected at Port Jackson on Saturday by L.
Steel and crew, from Newcastle, in their craft
Britannia. It was no gift, though. Skipper J.
Moppett, of the ; Valeta (Port Jackson Club), was
on the heels of the northern galleon from start to
finish, and just missed snatching the sugar by
28sfec.

There was a big meet of riders at Goul-
burn (N.S.W.) at the week-end under the auspices
of the Sydney Bicycle and Motor Cycle Club, the
occasion being the annual championship contests.
The 000 C.C. State championship race (60 miles)
was won by IC. C. Walker (Vie.), on a 31-h.p., in
SOmin. 37 2-ssec. Second and third places were
occupied by H. J. Nesbitt (Young, N.S.W,), on a
31-h.p., in 81 min. 2 2-ssec. ; and R. Williams (Syd-
ney), on a 2f-h.p., in 88min. 19sec. The 100 miles
open State champion turned up in J. R. Booth (Vic..)
on a 3|-h.p. His riding time," lhr. SOmin. 30sec.,
was lOmin. ahead of last yearns record. Two other
Victorians, J. Dixon and J. A. Gunn, were second
and third.
E. S. Douglas, Maoriland’s open golf
champion, will swing a club at the Australian
competitions in Sydney next September. If he
operates up to form there will be something for-
midable to beat. In the two'years he has spent in
the country since he arrived from Scotland this is
his record: Open championship of M.L. (1913-1914),
professional championship of M.L. (1914), Christmas
Tournament at Trentham (1914). He holds the
records for the Dunedin links, 71 ; Nelson, 70; and
Wanganui, 71. When he was 19 he battled for the
Scottish Professional Championship, and in a field
of 200 came 15th.

N. S. Wales Rugby League is going to
detach 5 per cent, of its gross takings at representa-
tive matches this season and pass the amount over
to the Belgian Fund. About £lO,OOO is expected
to be taken at these games. Last year the sum
was £12,500. Individual clubs and the Referees’
Assoc, arc also putting in a whack of what’s coming

“Bias”: The Sydney bowling community
is awaiting April 10 with some impatience to see
which of four clubs will qualify for the semi-finals
for the 191-1-5 pennant. The contestants arc Mos-
man and Chatswood and l’andwick and Ashfield.
City club and Lowlands, a Newcastle chib, have
already qualified (a coalopolis club is allowed to
compete in the Metrop. Championship). Bowls is
an apparent]}' peaceable sort of pursuit, yet it can
raise more arguments than any other. The clubs
are at present divided into two hostile camps as to
what is a “neutral green.” The rules require that
all semi-finals and finals be played on “neutral”
greens. The Pennant committee takes the fairly
obvious stand that a “neutral” green is a green
not the home of one of the playing-off clubs ; but as
some clubs have a liking for particular greens, and
know their idiosyncrasies, they argue that favoritism
lias been shown by the selections made (Balmain
and Victoria Park) and demand that the tests should
be on greens upon which none of the teams engaged
has played during the season. This seems a much
strained reading and impossible of execution, but
the disgruntled crowd has got quite heated about it.
Saturday’s wrestling bout at Wollongong
(N.S.W.) was between J. Lawson, from Balgownie,
and O. Betton, from Corrimal. It was announced as
a. contest for the lightweight championship of the
South Coast; arid the Corrimal man won four out of
the seven falls agreed upon. Style, Cumberland
and Westmoreland.

The Royal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition,nutritive value and digestibility,
and are al solutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 momhs
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards

valuable addition to baby’s dietary

Rusks are specially useful during ih *
troublesome time of teething. When

ment, and represent the most

What the whole Empire
uses for all forms of
KIDNEY TROUBLE.
Just a little exposure to cold or damp and
you liave got a pain in the back. Agony to
bend or move in any way, bad headache, pufli-
ness under the eyes, these mean for certain
that you have kidney trouble. Then you
should look out for deadly Bright’s disease,
which creeps on unawares.
It is positively dangerous to trifle or play
with the most simple form of kidney disease.
The moment any symptoms of kidney
trouble are detected a very simple and sure
remedy should be tried without delay.
What the Boers and other nations use
for Pains in different parts of the body.
You should use one which millions of people
are using throughout the wide world —one
which English sufferers have faith in, and so
have Scotch, Irish and Welsh people. Not
only these, the people in New Zealand. West
Africa, China-and India, in their millions,
swear by it.
The people of Holland, the Belgian, the
Frenchman, yes, and the German, too, all
know that it is the only one certain remedy
for kidney trouble. Canada’s and America’s
millions use and recommend it daily, and now
in Australia the sale is growing enormously—
the sure remedy they are all using is De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.
Why are all these millions of people using
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills?
Because they have proved by experience
that these wonderful little pills are really
life-savers.
If they are so good, if these multitudes of
people in every corner of the world are using
them with such great success, do you not think
it would be wise for you to give them a trial?
If you have such symptoms as a nasty taste
in the mouth first thing in the morning, con-
stipation, general feeling of weakness, and
m
Kidney&BladderPills
i These Pills also act on the liver 4
The Little Magic Box in Blue and Gold.
irritability, aches and pains in the muscles or
joints, puffiness under the eyes, or bad head-
ache, you certainly need De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills.
Or if you suffer from backache, rheumatism,
gout, sciatica, lumbago, stone, gravel or
in the bladder, muscles and joints, you are
foolish to yourself if you do not commence to
use these little wonder-workers immediately..
Many remedies claim to cure, and do, with-
out doubt, give relief for a time, but the one
remedy which will give you quick relief, and
most probably a permanent cure, is De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills, for whan once
cured by these wonderful little pills our
readers say they are cured for ever.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills can be
obtained at any of the branches of Washing-
ton H. Soul, Pattinson & Co., Ltd., Sydney;
Longmore’s, The Melbourne Pharmacy, Bourke
Street, Melbourne; and all leading chemists
at 2/9 and 5/6 per large box. The 5/6 size is
two and a half times as large as the 2/9 size,
and contains enough doses to last you three
weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above and the
goods will be sent by return, post free.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the cause—the
poisonous Uric Acid. Remember, to do this,
a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder, and not through the bowels
as most Kidney Pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy, bluish color —a fea-
ture which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills from
all others—you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right spot
—the kidneys and the bladder. A wonderful
pill—straight to the kidneys—that is the
reason why De Witt’s give such amazingly
quick relief every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue color.

Practically nobody buys these shares as an
investment: there are only 27,783 issued (£1
fully paid), and there are no less than 8665
holders. The thing most desired is the very
substantial bonus on purchases; and to enjoy
this it is only necessary to have one share.
Considering the turnover —about £350,000 a
year—the co.’s funds are extraordinarily
small; yet the liabilities, including a mort-
gage, amount to only £32,957. It couldn’t,
of course, be done but for the fact that
almost all the trading is for cash. Since the
co. sells for cash it can also buy for cash,
and thereby it last half-year collected £1783
in discounts —more than enough to pay the
10 p.c. dividend. If nothing else, the society
is an object-lesson in the art of making a
little capital go a long way. The Melbourne
society . wouldn’t have fallen into such a
mess if it had followed the same track.

From that table it looks as though the co.
is adding a fair amount to reserve after
paying the dividend. But this puts a
different view :
Jan., 1905. Jan., 1915.
Liquid assets ..£20,119 £20,898
Liabilities .. 512 1,288
Surplus ..£19,607 £19,610
In other words, the co. is in just the same
position, so far as liabilities and liquid assets
are concerned, as it was 10 years ago. _ Any
profit which has been made and not divided
has been put into plant or stock; and this
investment appears to have done very little
more than counterbalance adverse influences,
such as higher working and maintenance
costs. Surplus profits during the past two
or three years certainly have been a shade
better than usual; but there isn’t anything
to suggest the probability of an improved
dividend. In fact, conditions must keep
pretty good to justify the present 12 p.c.

“Disillusioned” (W.A.) : A word of
warning about Westonia. Gullible and
greedy fools still rush forward to try to
make money out of its wild cats, and hordes
anxious to follow suit are pressing at the
back of them. Most of the recent floats are
mere potholes. Nearly all are confident of
getting some leg or wing of the Edna May
reef if it goes down, and some claim to have
good reefs of their own; but not one of them
has yet had its prospectus values, etc., con-
firmed by an uninterested mining engineer
of any tonnage. All are absurdly over-valued
by the market. In fact, only those who
don’t care a hang about a mine’s value, and
rely solely on having the luck to get in on a
soaring market and to get out before _it
tumbles, should have anything to do with
the litter.
* * * *
Associated Northern shareholders met in
London on Feb. 10, when Herman Landau,
who has grown old in the co ; ’s service, held
forth on the prospects of its various in-
terests. The Victorious mine at Ora Banda
was declared to have a fair stretch of good
ore showing at No. 6 level, and with that
blocked out in the workings above should,
according to the Board’s advisers, return the
cost of the recently-installed sulphide plant
and a few thousands profit besides. The
patchy and generally disappointing nature of
the ore exposed at the 7th level was ad-
mitted ; also, the presence of arsenic at
depth. The treatment troubles caused by
this nuisance were, however, being over-
come, he said. But his observations on this
point must be accepted with caution. Cos.
annoyed with arsenic generally reckon
things are better than they really are. The
Iron Duke lease was admitted to be “near-
ing the end,” and the El Refugio (Mexico),
when last heard of, was looking as well as
could be expected. The Goodenough lease,
Menzies (W.A.). which proved the death ot
the Queensland Menzies Co. some years ago-
had, according to Landau, been sampled with
satisfactory results, and a limited amount is
being spent to see how prospects are at depth.

instance, Fricke, who is spruiking for Vic-

dim past he was appointed to induce farmers
to throw up their prairie lots for the rich
pastures of the Sunny South. The mission
seems to have been a tremendous success—

worn when last century was an infant, and
which John Thomas had the taste (as he
believed) and the courage to wear in the
twentieth century, or very close to it. For
a generation he was the only man in public
life in Victoria, and probably in Australia,
who stuck to the ancient fashion.

I Was Bald
and Grew New Hair to its
present length in 40 Days.
MR. CRA VEN BURLEIGH.
(From a recent photograph.)
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business man.
My hair began to grow thin about the time I reached the
age of thirty. When I had reached the age of thirty-five
the top of my head was quite bald. I had considerable
pride, and sought for something to cause renewed growth.
I invested in every preparation that I could see or hear of,
and here let me say that not only did I try all the English
so-called restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many sover-
eigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came not. I had
given up the idea of ever growing hair again. One after-
noon, while enjoying a brief business respite by an Alpine
trip, I fell in with an old collegiate chemist, whose hair was
particularly plentiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished
he could spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led
him to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a for-
mula and suggested that I have a quantity of the compound
prepared. I did this a few days later. I was astonished
to see the hair coming forth after several applications, and
within six weeks my head was covered with a firm, yet
soft, growth of hair. Since then the hair on my head has
been as luxuriant as when in my school days. Having
arranged for the legal right to do so, I have for some time
been privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. X hold over one thousand letters from people who
have actually grown new hair through the medium of my
true hair-grower. I do not pretend to, say it is the only
hair-grower in the world —I am not interested in deciying
others—but Ido assert that it is the most reliable, and in
the end by far the cheapest.

Dear Sir, —I ant enclosing, herewith one ol my
photographs, to give you some idea how my hair has
improved since using your True Haip „
Before I commenced its use my hair was falling in
handfuls and I was also greatly troubled with
dandruff. However, I am glad to say that my hair
has now stopped falling, the dandrufl conip ete y
been removed, and my hair has grown inu h t P !^ r
and longer. My friends are astounded at the diner-
ence in my hair, so I have a splendid opportunity
of singing the praises of your wonderful preparation.
You can use this letter and my jdiotograph in any
way you think fit, and you can rest assured that 1
will do all I can to induce my friends and acquaint-
ances to give your treatment a ’
I am, yours truly, RITA HUDSON.

IN
BANANA LAND
“S.G.” : Turn from the war for a minute
to hear of one of the heroes of peace. Sev-
eral years ago a boy, just getting into his
teens, was gripped by leprosy and sent to
Peel Island. A man who had made a play-
mate of the child begged to be allowed to
go with him, that he might tend his little
friend and any others who required aid. He
was given the leave and has been in the lazar-
ette ever since. The allowance he receives
is 10s. a week, and the whole lot goes to
charity. Brisbane Hospital Board knows
about it, and the other day added the name
of Charlie Owen to its roll of life sub-
scribers.
There’s no doubt about it, the climate of
the North saps the strength out of men.
The other May at Cairns 10 weaklings (in-
cluding two small boys) were, upset in a
squall. Being enervated by the climate they
were unable to right the craft, and could
merely hang on to the gear. That was on
Saturday afternoon at four o’clock. 'No
help came, and the dark and terror of the
night were up to time-table. All through the
long hours before daylight they hung on and
drifted. The dawn brought relief. They
saw they were being driven ashore, and at
eight o’clock they scrambled on to a spit
where they were picked up and hustled
home to get some breakfast. A local paper
went so far as to say that they were “little
the worse for their immersion,” but, then,
that’s just the Northern way of cracking
hardy and covering up the local infirmity.
Two ultimatums appeared simultaneously
last week concerning preference to unionists.
One was from the Denham Government, and
was delivered to the Federal Government.
Minister for Works Barnes declared that
the Queensland Government was willing to
co-operate with the national Government in
regard to Commonwealth works in the
northern State, on condition that preference
was not given to unionists. So indignant
was Barnes’s Government at any such
scheme as preference that, if it were in-
sisted on, the friendly relations between the
two Administrations must, he said, end with
great suddenness. Cheek and jowl with
that buzz was Kitchener’s ultimatum in con-
nection with the formation of a battalion of
dockers for home defence: “Only unionists
will •be enrolled.” Still, Barnes’s troubles
about Kitchener!
“Old Man” Barlow, who lagged super-
fluous on the political stage of Bananaland
till Nature relieved the situation, was of
that type of Parliamentarian which justifies
the elective system. He was a whale for
office, and held to it no matter what the
price. As a result he was an almost con-
tinuous Cabinet Minister: he could accom-
modate himself to any leader. Morgan, Kid-
ston, and for a time Denham always got
him to represent the Premier during their
absence from the State, for no better reasons
than that he was dumb to the press and
others, and would do no damage because he
would do nothing. Even in his own office
lie used to daily wave the reporters off by
saying in a cold voice, “Nothing to-day.
gentlemen,” until the men habitually passed
by liis door. Not that they missed anything,
for Barlow had no views of any value.
Certainly, he nursed a crude and
childish hostility to Federation all through
the piece; but that merely proved his medi-
ocrity, if it did anything. This hatred of
the union induced him to spend enough cash
on the blue pencil with which he voted
against Federation to mount it in gold, and
he wore it in front of him. Ilis other
choice antipathy was George Reid, and that
was based on the tremendous ground that
on one occasion the jocund globe had re-
ferred to him as “Old Billy Barlow.”
After considering Premier Denham’s Jingo
utterance about Australia being determined
to “share her last beast” wit* England, Melb.
Age decided that the time was ripe to give
him the boot. This from the left: —-
Tlie Denham policy is dictated simply and solely
by the beef-exporting interest.
This from the right
In Mr. Denham Australians can have no confidence
at all, for he has shown himself both blind and
indifferent to the larger interests both of his con-
stituents and of the nation.
The echo of those two thuds is still rum-
bling uj • north.
After years of battling the Australian-
owned company fishing for pearlshell in the
Dutchman’s Aroe Islands has called in its
fleet and obtained permission to return and
work in Australian waters. Shell has been
getting very scarce around the Aroes ; hence
the desire to return even to a country where
the nigger has to be paid a living wage.
The fleet comprises 92 boats, and is manned
by an alien mixture which is rather tougher
than the usual lot, so Broome and Thursday
Island are likely to get some choice addi-
tions to their polyglot population. Clark
and Munro, of Brisbane, and Captain Geo.
Smith, of Sydney, are the chief owners of

Treasurer Barnes will have a hard row to
hoe this election. His seat (Bulimba), once
a Tory fortress, is now a stronghold of the
workers, many hundreds of whom, employees
of the Meat Trust, are his hostile consti-
tuents. Barnes, however, is a battler, and
the man who takes his scalp will have to
fight for it.
The Party Joss is on the wobble. Said
Hugh D. Macrossan a few days ago:—
Owing to party politics being the controlling force
in the last Parliament, I have sat with my best hand
tied behind my back. On the other side matters
are just as bad. I do not therefore propose to re-
submit myself unless I can have an absolutely free
hand, untrammelled by ties to any individual. I
favor elective Ministries, and think-that throughout
Australia the interests of the State are being sacri-
ficed to party exigencies. I personally cannot see
my way to accept Mr. Denham’s endorsement.
Quite a number of Australia’s best men sit
not only with their “best hand,” but with
both hands, tied behind their back owing to
a corrupt and stupid Party system. Mac-
rossan deserves credit for his plucky rebel-
lion.

My ladye’s lippe, a curving bowe
Of corail redde, it hides a rowe
Of purest pearles that sometimes shine
And mock in merriment divine
When jeste or song arise and flowe ;
I knowe not whye it takes me soe,
But dailye seems the charme to growe
That haunts with fragrance fayre and fine
My ladye’s lippe.
But when the stormes of anger blowe
And heave her bosom to and fro,
How hotte dothe wax this herte of myne
To note that sweet and dajntie line,
To marke what tempestes surge belowe

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 3, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
Our new Excellencies are getting into the
way of doing the little odd jobs for which
they were imported at great expense. Last
Friday Lady Goold-Adams went to the Red
Cross" rooms, and looked at samples of the
various garments made there in the Good
Cause. Her Ex. was manifestly pleased,
for she wrenched sufficient time from her
engagement book to repeat the visit this
week. It’s quite surprising how the band
of workers multiplies on the occasion of a
vice-regal call. Besides the busy bees who
roll up to the hive day after day, some dozens
of drones buzz in on these special occasions.
To see them hovering eagerly around the
tables you might almost be deluded into
suspecting them of work.
Mrs. Cecil Palmer has promised to lend
her elegant home, Palmarosa, to the Hamil-
ton branch of the Red Cross Society on
April 27 for the purposes of a card and
gossip fete.
The death of Kenneth Chambers, a hand-
some lad of 17, brought Mrs. Chambers and
her daughter Ida home from Sydney about
a fortnight ago. They return next week,
Pa will travel with them on his way to Mel-
bourne, where he will attend the annual
meeting of the Federal Council of A'rchi-
tects.
The Commercial Travellers’ Association
of Australasia is holding its annual pow-
wow in Brisbane. Yesterday the handsome
Mrs. Bowcher entertained the visiting
ladies at a motor drive to. Sandgate, and
q-ffpi'wnni* lim* IIOTTIP 111 tllG
artei waicls at tea at net orne in me
evening a paity of about 60 saw the citj
from a tramcar.
To-day a cheerful At Home was the
extravagance. It was staged at the Com-
mercial Travellers' Club, where Mrs Bow-
cher received the guests on behalf of Mrs.
Richards, the president’s missus, a brace of
Powell girls, Mrs. Richards’s sisters, lend-
ing an industrious hand. Mrs. Bowcher,
always perfectly gowned, looked extra entic-
ing in a saxe-blue outfit, with the new
tightly-fitting bodice and a military hat.
To-night the Black and White Pierrots
are supplying, the music at another “com-
plimentary,” and on, Monday President and
Mrs. Richards will foot the bill for a motor
party to Cleveland.
Last Saturday night at His Majesty’s
Theatre, when Violet Paget (Mrs. Hugh
Buckler) and her co. bade farewell to the
local youth and fashion, there were 24
recalls at the final curtain of “The Man on
the Box,” and it required at least two vans
to trundle away the vegetation that was
heaped on the stage. ' Lady Goold-Adams,
acting on behalf of Mrs. Buckler’s Brisbane
friends, handed her an address and a gold
wristlet watch. Colonel Goddard read the
illuminated language, and Mrs. Fred Barker
and Miss May Fitzgerald (who were re-
sponsible for working up the surprise)
glowed with satisfaction.
Excellency Goold-Adams wasn’t at the
theatre. He was being done proud at the
Queensland Club. Of course, mere females
are taboo there, but a German spy told me
that there were very nearly a hundred
courses. Perhaps the scoundrel meant
toasts.
Mrs. “Billy” Carr tea-ed a number of the
sex on Wednesday afternoon at Ascot. The
usual competition was fought out among the
teacups, and was won by Miss Chapman,
who sails in a couple of days for England
and duty. She is to join the R.A.M.C. Mrs.
Carr’s mother, Mrs. Cohen, and her sister,
Mrs. Percy Cowan, helped to keep the peace.
Arthur Morgan and son Rowley contem-
plate a flit to San Francisco to inspect the
al-mighty Exposition. Probably on that
account a new acting-private-sec. has been
installed at Government House. He is Tom
Thatcher, a pressman who has made many
friends among the inkstained tribe in Bris-
bane.
R. B. Shears, of the Royal Bank, who is
about to visit England, was dined on
Wednesday night by a number of business
men. The guest was handed a souvenir.
Miss Pollard, who made a lot of friends
in the North when she was matron of the
Rockhampton Children’s Hospital, is now
lion, matron of the hospital for wounded
soldiers at Gifford House, London. The
Duchess of Westminster vacated the
premises to make way for wounded Tommy.
The marriage of Hilda Love, youngest
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Wilton Love, to
Ewan Spence, youngest limb of the Lock-
hart Spence family tree, will, according to
warnings issued, happen on April 14.
John Patrick McNamara, of the Justice
Department, and acting-private-sec. to
“Jimmy” Blair, is the latest victim to the
treacherous surf at Southport. A few
months ago a brother was killed at South-
port by a motor-car. One of those useful
lives might have been saved if, on the Main
Beach, in addition to the life-lines, there
were - life-guards. The latter are only
employed in the holiday season, and some
reckless people will persist in having an
ocean bath on other occasions.
Brisbane women are waiting to welcome
back their Martha Burns, who when she is
at home whizzes round in the intervals of
her dental practice. With a long record of
good works in every cause behind her. she
left us to attend the international
dental congress in London. The con-
gress having been dislocated by the war,
Martha took the job of nursing sister and
dental surgeon at Lady Dudley’s war hos-
pital at St. Nazaire, France, and worked
herself into a breakdown. Invalided home,
she is circling thither by way of America,
Maoriland and the Cabbage Garden.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Brisbane Courier has a hard row to hoe
these days. It has been chattering to the
effect that, even though Denham mightn’t
be much good, they must put up with him
because of the dreadful tiger which the
Labor party keeps on its premises. Thus: —
The prime danger to the State just now is not the
possession of place by ill-placed individuals, but the
risk of a Socialistic triumph.
And then, when the poor, old Courier had
said that Denham’s only virtue was his anti-
socialism, along came Denham with his
policy :
(1) State water supply for settlers,
(2) More State education.
(3) State encouragement of fisheries.
14)' State insurance* against unemployment.
(5) State organisation and support of agricul-
tural bureaus.
(6) State control of the oil industry—if State
experts decide that an oil industry is possible.
(7) More State railways—and he was proud to
have opened 908 miles of line during his four years
in office.
(8) State legal assistance for the poor.
(9) A Greater Brisbane, permitting municipal
Socialism in trams, water and sewerage, fire-fight-
ing, lighting, abattoirs, etc.
(10) Any other State assistance that any sufficient
number of voters care to ask for.
As there was no merit in the men of the
Denham crowd, and as there is now none
in their measures either, the Courier is
busy looking them over to see if it can’t
detect some overwhelming virtue in the cut
of their hair or the way they wear their
waistcoats.

Maoriland’s Rhodes scholar this year, H.
S. Richards, M.A., is a bright product of
Canterbury College, and the Dominion Univer-
sity’s star in pure and applied mathematics.
He is the first Christchurch man to get
away with the scholarship, and local satis-
faction expressed itself in the form of a
purse of sovereigns, a bundle of books and a
steamer ticket to England.
Call Ernest Alfred Vizetelly, one of the
English war-correspondents who was through
the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. In
bis' book, “My Days of Adventure,” he de-
scribes the taking of a village named
Chateudun
The fierce fight was followed by terrible scenes.
Most of the Francs-tireur who had not fallen in
the engagement effected a retreat. On discovering
this, the infuriated Germans, to whom the mere
name of Franc-tireur was as a red rag to a bull,
did not scruple to shoot down a number of non-
combatants, including women and children .... In vain
did the Germans strive to gloss over the truth. The
proofs were too numerous and the reality was too
dreadful. Two hundred and thirtv-five of the devoted
little town’s houses were committed to the flames.
Women were assaulted, and a couple of German
princes disgraced their exalted station in a drunken
and incendiary orgy.
Can a leopard change his spots or a hog his
hoggishness?
From “Bad Australian,” who buys his
Bulletin in Argentina :
From an article in the Railway Gazette
(2/10,/’l4) entitled “Jubilee of the Queensland Rail-
ways,’’- it wpuld seem that Bananaland has gone from
Greenland’s icy mountains to India’s coral strand in
search of people to run its narrow-gauge roads and
keep the white ant out of its little locos. The list
runs like this: Chief Commissioner, nationality not
stated, but apparently a Welshman; Deputy Com-
missioner, Scottish ; General Traffic Superintendent,
English; Chief Engineer, Scottish; Chief Mechanical
Engineer, Indian. I wish it to be distinctly under-
stood that 1 make no comment on the Ram Chunder
part of the show. But why so much McTavish and
so little Billjim ? What is the matter with the
Australian? Outside Australia he is doing the world’s
best work in pioneer railroading and in mining.
Generally starting off scratch, with the handicap of
having to do business in a foreign lingo, he invari-
ably makes good. One of him, during his last days
in Australia, tore a crust out of the teeth of the
Bent Government in Victoria by grafting like an
infuriated devil to keep an axeman’s job in a survey
party at six bob per day. The job finished, he went
up to Newcastle, and shipped before the mast in a
coal crate bound for Callao, where ho got a start
with a Yankee outfit as “transit-man” on a survey
in Upper Peru, Since then he has never looked
back, and when he, goes out on a job the aggressive
legend “Reservado” blazoned on his private car pro-
claims to whom it may concern that he has made
good. Yet only a few years ago Australia had no
use for this man other than for the slavery of a
bushwhacker. An exalted Personago was some months
ago reported to have said that many of Australia’s
useful men were forced to pursue the bubble in
foreign parts for want of opportunity at home. He
was further stated to have laid stress ol the necessity
of keeping these useful folk at home, and he was
understood to ask what Australia proposed to do
about it. Good! It is time Australia left off
nosing round the railroads and paddy fields of the
world for folk to run her business when she has the
best kind of material on the doormat—material only
requiring a fair deal to keep it from reaching for
the coal-shovel which franks it to China or Peru,
to the nation’s immediate loss and the standing dis-
grace of those responsible for a deplorable exodus
of useful sons.

*i«r ,i to Mrs ’ Dishragge on her day out:
Well tar-tar f’r the present! I’m goin’ ter
bring home a few centipedes an’ a snake or
two f’r th’ children ter play with,” I could
hurry round )to the police-station and take
out a summons or a writ of habeas corpus.
But there is no remedy whatever if the hired
lunatic decides to bring home germs—which
are much harder to avoid than anything that
creeps or crawls. Last week, despite Mrs.
Disliragge’s shrill warnings, our stipendiary
ass went oft to spend most of her alleged
day-out in the stuffy sick-room of a relative
who was dowif with influenza. The ass loft-
ily informed- Mrs. D. that whatever other
people might dp, nothin’ would keep ’er from
her auntie s side. And so she went. She
came homeby a late train thoroughly
pleased and itifected, and next day she was
earning her salary by sneezing in bed, while
her enraged vemployer was doing the house-
work with fftne hand and making gruel with
the other. We are now denouncing the germ-
b ringer under our breaths, and waiting
miserably Mr; our share of the curse that
• j-i! een ll Pon us. Mary Ann’s savage
lndifferencMo infection is, I think, due to a
ceitain brffrßl. ofi religion—-the self-righteous
leligion that teaches its adherents to believe
that only the wicked “catch things.”
Pallanza’s” tale of the last voyage :—-
“Chips 1 Chips !”--veiled the First Mate, from the
starboard rail. “Where’s that blasted carpenter?”
Dunno, sir,” replied the bos’n, peering into
the gloom. ’ere a couple of minutes back.”
( lle skippgjfe P'oar boomed down from the bridge:
Now, the** Ajister Baxter, what’re you waiting
for?” Sly
Aye, shouted the First Mate, and turned
to the bos’n. . ' “Heave her up, easy,” he said, and
stared Over the:rail to watch the chain.
The head vibrated with the clattering of
the winch, sajid a stream of water from the hose held
over the rajL smashed the clinging mud from the
ascending links. - In the midst of the uproar, the
banging of the ancient winch, the spitting of escaping
steam, the dull clinking against the hawse-holes,
and the spluiteriug of the hose, an extraordinary
sound rcaohedjythe bos'ri’s cars. He nearly released
the controlling handle in his surprise, for the sound
was a scream, and he could have
sworn that the'-ljbise ca u me from between his feet.
He looked drnftS and around him in the darkness,
but the man was coiling a rope 10ft. away.
Then a sudden idea dispelled his bewilderment. Of
course, a link scraping in the chain-pipe beside him!
Ten minutes later the anchor was up and lashed.
The First Mate was descending the ladder to the
fore-deck, when an excited apprentice rushed up
from below and gasped a message in his ear.
“Bos’n! Bos'n —lamps—quick!”
The three hurried down to the chain-locker. The
carpenter’s bag was outside and his lamp was hang-
ing on the hook.
“Out with the chain, bos’n—all hands!” said the
officer.
Twenty minutes afterwards a pulpy horror was
extricated from beneath a ton of anchor-chain. . . .

Anaemia
Frequently Unrecognised
The Importance of its Detection
The Symptoms of Anaemia (Poorness
of Blood) are Difficulty of Breathing, Lack of
Energy, Depression, Pallor, and Exhaustion after
Slight Exertion. Many people fail to recognise
these symptoms of Anaemia— the disease creeps
on, obtains'a firm grip of the system and eventually
becomes-chronic. If the symptoms are recognised
at the beginning' it is a very simple matter to enrich
•the blood and so effectually check' the. disease.
enrich the blood-renew vitality
After taking IRON ‘JELLOIDS,’ the blood becomes
enricliecl ahd"slreng'thehed, the distressing symptoms ot
Anaemia quickly' disappear, giving place to a state ot
vigorous health and buoyant spirits.
DR. ANDREW WILSON wrote “It can be definitely stated
“ that Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ constitute the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”
A fortnight’s trial ( Price 1/6 ) will convince you.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the' result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new. life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action,, and cleanses and in vigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared jor emergencies by always keeping a
bottle .in the house.

“Potts and Shirk’’: Not content with the
joint service obtained from C. E. W. Bean,
Australia’s official war correspondent, Argus
and Age each sent a member of its own staff
with the troops to Egypt. Charlie Smith
went on behalf of “Jeames,” as the Age per-
sists in calling its contemoorary; and “Pip’
Schuler, a son of editor G. F. H. Schuler,
represented Syme’s paper. The work done
by these rival boys has evidently inflamed
the ardor of those left behind. When Dr.
Dave Officer’s motor-car caught fire in Col-
lins-street the other night while _ Dave was
taking a temperature, or something, in the
Savage Club, the flames were put out by a
wideawake person with a hand-extinguisher.
Writing up the blaze the Syme roundsman
said: “The successful fire-fighter was Mr.
John Hanks, an employe of the Age office.”
The Argus man observed : “The flames were
noticed by an employee in the Argus _ office,
who ran down with a hand fire-extinguisher.

“Scribe”: Something else needs to be said'
concerning that Melba-Petersen scheme -for
a Melba gift-book to help blood-stained Bel-j
gium. With the aid of a manifolder 200 to;
300 appeals have been sent to Australian
writers and artists, asking them to prepare
contributions. It has not occurred to Melba
to take the trouble to, even sign the request.
One man I know to whom Melba (or Peter-
sen ) sent this circular memo, from the mani-
folder has a reputation in three continents.,
This is scarcely the way in which one artist
should treat another. #

to see him perish at the altar. Evidently
ashamed of it himself, the ceremony was

casting derision on young Peterson, of the
Argus staff, in his capacitv as editor-elect
of the Melba Gift Book. I want to enter
a caveat. Peterson has had a university
education, ''Writes three languages, has
already printed some excellent verse, and
has never in his life been suburban corres-
pondent for a daily paper. In any case, his
work on the Gift Book will be more secre-
tarial than editorial, and few will envy his
job in rounding up dilatory artists and
writers. The effort is honorary and honor-
able, so why crab it at the start because of
the disgruntled protests of people who haven t
been invited to paste their advt. on the
Belgian tombstone? I know enough of the
goodwill of Australian writers to be sure
that they will make the thing a success, not
for Peterson’s nor Melba’s sake, but because
they want to help a race which, doing its
highest duty, has suffered as none ever
suffered before.

“Dog Tired”: The travelling boot-
merchant and the tripping draper who give
their “impressions” of the whole round earth
to a gaping daily have always been a severe
trial; but in this time of war, when people
are aching to know tilings, the mental
returned-empty who has suddenly become
an authority upon everything by virtue of
a steamer ticket and a file of foreign hotel
bills comes as an extra curse. The trouble is
that the owner of the boot studio knows
that he is more likely to seem “superior” if
he says that Australia is lagging behind:
so he says the banal 'thing. And the paper
keeps ■ one eye on the bootnmn’s. bad gram-
mar and the other on the good space he pays
for in the advertising ‘ columns, and the
banal thing is printed. Apparently the boot-
artist and the shoe-licking artist are both
incurable. But I do think that, every time
a newspaper mentions one of its persistent
advertisers it should also mention the fact
that he is an advertiser. As: “Mr. Ezekiel
Webclaw (advt.), the well-known bootsmith,
returned from Europe yesterday. Mr. Web-
claw (advt.) said”—. Then the public
would be on guard.

“Rangan”: “Sr.” (B. 28/1/T5) speaks of

This writer was once connected with a
Bananaland outback paper, in which a nup-
tial announcement appeared under the head-
ing “Crimes and Accidents.” Next morning
the enraged bridegroom, who was the local
butcher, chased th« editor four times round
the pub. with a meat axe.

The Mother’s Letter.
“My little boy and girl, 4 years of age (twins), were suffering severely from
Whooping Cough, almost choking with phlegm, the coughing fits causing them to
turn black in the face and greatly exhausting them,” writes Mrs. E. Arundale, 2<
Russell Street, Dunedin, N.Z. “We could get no remedy to relieve them, and we
had tried a great many at considerable expense, but they were of no curative
value whatever. A lady friend mentioned Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, to us as
a sure remedy, and from the time they started taking it they speedily improved,
and in a very short time indeed they were completely and permanently cured,
thanks to Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, for which we are very grateful, and will
recommend it on all possible occasions.”
Safeguards the Home.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a safe and certain remedy for children’s
winter ills, and has brought health and strength to thousands of sickly children.
It can be relied on to check the cold so quickly that the rosy cheeks time
to grow pale, and the little brain remains clear and sensitive for the day s study.
No coughing at night when Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery has been taken before
bedtime, but deep refreshing sleep to fit the children for another day of school.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery has become the Australasian mother’s refuge in
relieving and curing Croup, Whooping Cough, Influenza and Bronchitis.

The Weaker Sex.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DURING the nights when the burglar
' boom was loud in the land the
general topic at the dinner table at
Alstonleigh boarding establishment was of
what should he done should bad characters
hushrange those pleasant premises. Jaikes,
the journalist, impressed upon the company
the extreme foolishness of trying to oppose
an armed brigand or land pirate. Said he:
‘‘Be as cool as you can and, if possible,
pretend to be asleep all the time. To scream
or shout is to invite attention with a jimmy.
To get up and block the way out is to in-
vite artillery practice. To spring out and
close with him is to get worsted through
having your toes trodden on. No bare-
footed man can light one wearing boots. So
altogether, it is better to let the jewellery go
than lose both jewellery and life.”
“Just lie still and let the wretches get
away with all your pretty things—not me!”
said Miss Talbot.
“Yes, certainly; most certainly in your
case. Any burglar with an ounce of good
taste who caught sight of you would leave
the jewels and take the lady,” said the glib
journalist.
Miss Talbot blushed, The other ladies
made mildly sarcastic remarks.
“There’s a lot in that,” said Morrison
ambiguously. “But I should only play
’possum till he was leaving, and then when
his back was turned I’d leap out of bed and
give him the water-jug across his napper.”
“xlnd get shot for your trouble!” snapped
Pearson, a burly youth of 22.
“What would you do?” inquired Miss Tal-
bot of her youthful brother, who had just
started to flourish a pen in a shipping office.
“I’d follow Jaikes’s advice to the letter,”
said the brother.
“I remember once,” said Jaikes dreamily,
“a burglar came to my room and started fos-
sicking. I was awake when he came in, but
pretended to be asleep. Then I pretended, to
wake up, and speaking in a whisper said:
‘lt’s no good, Billy, you’ll find no matches
there. Had to come to bed in the dark
myself. Don’t make a noise. They’ve shifted
the little sick kid to the next room; and
she’s pretty bad. Sneak off quietly, like, a
good boy.” He replied in a faint, indistin-
guishable whisper and stole off. All he took
was a middle-aged overcoat and a youthful
umbrella he found in the hall, having decided
that a house with a sick child was not a
healthy site for a thriving burglary.”
“A most excellent bluff, Jaikes; a most
excellent bluff —or lie,” said Marshall. “How
many burglars have —er —interviewed you?”
“Three lots altogether,” said Jaikes, more
dreamily still, stirring his tea with a stick
of celery to the passionate amusement of the
women. “I had to kill the second one. The
third got converted and joined the Salvation
Army.”
The table tittered.
Morrison dug his hand laboriously into
his hip pocket and after many struggles pro-
duced therefrom something that looked like
a badly-battered carpenter’s square, and
flourished it in the gaslight.
“An automatic pistol with 14 cartridges
stowed away in the handle; and the first
burglar that comes in this house gets the
lot heaped at him; and all in one act.”
“Great Scott!” said Jaikes, hurriedly.
“Say, is that thing loaded?”
“You bet your life!” said Morrison.
“Then put it away before it explodes,”
said Jaikes. And as he spoke there was a
sudden stampede from the table. Then
Jaikes went on :
“Shooting-irons are all right, provided
you don’t lose your block. The trouble is
that it is usually the wrong person gets shot.
There’s not a wall in the house those, bullets
wouldn’t pass through, and perhaps kill some
of us. Take my advice and pawn it. One
can always get rid of a thing by pawning
it.”
“I won’t lose my block, old man!” said
Morrison sagely.
-:(•***
Talbot was awakened by someone kicking
a tin trunk ; and as he woke the young man
could hear a stealthy movement. The room
was very dark and Talbot remembered the
advice of Jaikes. Making a noise as though
turning over he commenced to draw long
deep breaths. But he kept his eyes.and ears
wide open, and after about five minutes he
saw a tiny ray of light proceed from some
point and roam over the dressing table.
The sweat broke out behind Talbot’s ears.
There was a burglar in the room, and he
had collected quite a nice little lot of loot. Sud-
denly Talbot’s nerves gave way and with a
loud howl he bounded out of bed and dashed
into the hall, slammed his bedroom door
behind him, held the handle tight, and yelled
for Morrison. He heard Morrison bound
out of bed and rush to his door —and then
he heard Morrison slam his door and lock
it.
“Ring up the police, Talbot —rush out
into the street and raise the alarm; but look
out he don’t pot you!” bawled. Morrison
through the fast locked door against which
he industriously piled his luggage with heavy
thuds.
Miss Talbot rushed into the passage.
“Come away from that door at once—he
may fire through it!” she screamed, waving
a candle over her head, and spilling grease
from the attic to the kitchen.
Talbot took the advice, and sprang to the
door of Pearson, found it locked, and clam-
ored to bo admitted.
The door of Jaikes’s room flew open and
Mrs. Jaikes appeared with a candle and lit
the gas. . ,
“There’s a burglar in my brothers room.
Mrs. Jaikes,” screamed Miss Talbot. Then
she and her brother dragged Mrs. Jaikes
back to her bedroom, and slammed the door.
“And my husband’s not home,” said Mrs.
Jaikes. “Whatever will we do. I wonder if
he is armed?” .
“Sure to be. He has an electric torch,
said Talbot. , ,
“Did you bring out your, watch and
chain?” suddenly demanded Miss Talbot.
“No fear—l just got myself out,” said
Talbot.
Both ladies uttered a piercing scream,
dashed into the kitchen and seized a set of
flat irons. Miss Talbot threw open the door
of her brother’s room, and revealed a
shadowy figure with a frame of motor
goggles over the top of his face and a black
handkerchief tied round his chin. With an
oath he stepped towards the two peering
women ; but as he stepped a flat iron rocketed
into his chest and sent him with a thud
against the chest of drawers. Then another
one banged through the mirror just over
him ; and a third made a dent in the floor
within an inch of his head. A water jug
scattered right over him, clean through the

KEEP ZAM-BUK ALWAYS BY YOU
AIX classes of workers stand in daily need of Zam-Buk’s soothing and
healing aid. A cut, bruise, knock or pinch may not seem of much
account when the first pain lias passed away, but unless the injured
place is dressed with Zam-Buk there remains the great danger that dirt
and disease germs will get into the wound and set up inflammation,
festering, blood-poison, or skin disease, that may mean months of suffering
and compulsory idleness.
If, however, Zam-Buk is at once smeared over a cut or bruise, the
balm’s juices soothe the pain, fortify the injury against germ atttacks,
and ensure rapid and perfect healing.
As an insurance against festering and poisoned wounds, a pot of this
powerful germicide and healer should always be kept handy in cupboard,
tool-bag or pocket.
ENGINEERS PAINFUL WOUND.
Developed into Inflamed, Festered, Running; Sores.
Mr. P. Walter, of 108 North Terrace, Adelaide (S.A.), who is an
engineer, says: “I sustained a severe burn on my arm by coming in
■ contact with the side of a furnace. The injury
caused me intense pain. The wound became
inflamed, and soon was in a terrible state.
Complications set in and festers started, and
the inflammation increased. I applied many
well-known remedies, but things grew worse.
“Little blisters formed, which gradually
merged to great running sores, from which
matter flowed freely. My arm was in a very
bad state when a friend recommended Zam-
Buk. I followed his advice, and felt a sooth-
ing sensation after the first few applications.
The excessive pain ceased and the burning in-
flammation died away. I continued with Zam-
Buk until the wound was completely healed,
and I was able to use my arm again. Since
that time I have often used Zam-Buk for
burns, knocks and cuts, and it has not failed
me once.”
Zam-Buk is invaluable for eczema, piles,
ringworm, ulcers, bad leg;s, sores, old
wounds, diseased ankles, blood poison,
cracked skin, sore feet, scabs, itch, sore
heads cuts, burns, bruises, scalds, etc. All

“Yes, It Gives a Queenly
Complexion Quicßly, Surely.
TOILET TALKS.
THE average woman of to-day is usually
satisfied if her complexion is passably
pretty, little knowing that an exquisite skin
is now within hen reach, providing she has
the good sense to stop using cheap made-up
preparations, and • adopt what has now be-
come known as the mercolised wax habit.
It is a pity that every woman in the land
cannot be apprised of this simple method.
The few to whom its virtues are already
known have complexions that are the envy
of all their friends, and, as is usually the
case, the majority of them refuse to divulge
the secret. However, the formula has now
been verified, and is known as
mercolised wax. Enquiry at
several chemists’ shops has re-
sulted in ascertaining that this
substance has been known to
the select few for some years as
a complexion beautifier, but it
is only until quite recently that
it has been used to any extent
for this purpose. It was also
explained how mercolised wax
renews the complexion, but as
this is rather technical it is not
proposed to repeat it here. It
will be sufficient to say that
through some peculiar action the
wax absorbs the dead and dis-
colored outer cuticle, revealing the fresh
young complexion which every woman has
underneath. The process occupies about ten
days, and the change is so gradual and im-
perceptible that no discomfort whatever is
caused. The treatment is perfectly harm-
less, and the wax may be used as often as
desired. . , .
HVTOW what about that shampoo? Pre-
sumably like a good many others you
follow blindly in the beaten track, without
a moment’s thought as to where it will
eventually lead you. It is an impossibility
to expect the, same make ,of slrii pno to suit
each individual .head of hail’. In softie cases
it would take out too much of the natural
oil, and in others not enough. Fair folks
require a milder shampoo than those with
dark tresses; therefore the logical course to
d
pursue is to make your own shampoo and
graduate the. strength according to the sus-
ceptibilities of'i your’ hair. The brush will
tell you whether you are treating the. hair
properly. Like a plant in congenial soil the
hair will grow and flourish providing the
conditions are right; but abuse it as most
women do by washing it with some strong
alkaline solution and the effect is practically
the same as if you poured weed-killer over
growing plants. Before leaving the subject
I should like to mention that a few months
ago my local, chenlist recommended me to try
ordinary stallax in place of the usual made-
up powders, and I must say that
this substance, to my mind,
forms an ideal medium for the
purpose mentioned. If anything
it makes the hair rather too
fluffy and wavy, but some folks
prefer it so.
IT is astonishing the number
of women who suffer from
the humiliating affliction of
superfluous hair, and I am sorry
to, say that through ignorance
or wrong treatment, the majority
of them have made matters con-
siderably worse by causing the
hairs to grow more quickly and
stronger than before. . It only requires
a little thought to realise the folly
of it all. Removing the surface growth
for, a few days may give temporary
relief, but in order to obtain per-
manent results the hair roots must be
killed. Caustic depilatories are worse than
useless, and on no account should the
hairs be pulled out. Apart from the
electric needle, which is a, costly and pain-
ful process, any chemist , will tell you
that the best home treatment is pure pow-
dered pheminol, which has a devitalising
effect upon the hair roots, in addition to
which it removes all trace of the objection-
able hair in a few .seconds, and the
recommended treatment gradually, but surely,
dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. [.

voices, rushed for more ammunition.
It was his one chance. He sprang for the

in the rear and helped him into the garden.
Then the screaming stopped, both ladies
having lost breath.
Jaikes lowered himself groggily from the
all-night tram, and zigzagged gallantly to-
wards his gate. He felt that it would be the
right thing to take off his boots and get to
his own room without awakening anybody.
Next morning he could bluff his wife that he
got home a little after 1 a.m. He didn’t
notice that the faint screams he heard came
from the house towards which he was
making. Neither did he notice that his home
was a blaze of light. He went up the steps
that led from the street to the garden and
took the whole passage way as he went.
He had just negotiated the third step
when something happened. To Jaikes it
seemed that a meteorite weighing about 10
tons had struck the top of the steps and thou
bounded down them, and hit him, Jaikes, all
over. With an oath he crashed against the
wall behind him, and then rolled down the
steps with something that clawed, kicked
and swore, and threatened to “cut his flaming
neck.”
“Good Godsli!” gasped Jaikes; “Ttsli th’
tigerish got out of Zoo. Well. I be dashed !”
But the object had gone and Jaikes found
himself sitting in a small puddle at the
bottom of the steps. He got up with diffi-
culty and felt himself all over. This inter-
esting and important operation took some
time, and then the shaken journalist toiled
to the top of the steps and found there were
lights gleaming from every window.
Puzzled at this glare and wondering if
the house was on fire he lumbered to the
door and tried to insert his key. More
screams from inside, and a flat iron flew
through the colored glass front. At a side
window someone fired a volley, and the bark
of the automatic pistol was accompanied by
a smashing of glass, shouts of women and
roars from the houses opposite.
“Watsh up—damn it. I say, watsh up
inside there. » Opensh door an’ stop frowin’
thingsli. Shtop at onsh! Morrislion put
that gun ’way, at onsh! Hear me,
Morrislion, blast you!”
There was a patter of feet on the hall,
and the door being suddenly wrenched open
from the inside Mr. Jaikes. fell into his home.
Later he heard the story four different ways,
and suddenly a heavenly light overspread
his countenance.
“Thatsh must have been him bumped me
on stepsh !” he said brightly.
THE RAKE.
The Fairy Godmother.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE were thousands, possibly mil-
lions, of women more virtuous , (bait
Mrs. Nicholls who were not half as
good.
•After the fashion of- female- relatives who
consider they have a right to guide,.your"
moral footsteps, a female relative, wlnwcaihe
to see me some little time after I had estab-
lished myself in lodginsrs at Mrs. Nicholls’s
house, declared that she was an awful
woman, and that I ought not to stay another
hour in the place. My relative announced
that, anyway, she would not come to see me
again, and she kept her word.
I kept my lodgings.
From my noint of view Mrs. Nicholls was
a woman with some peculiarities, but of sur-
passing good nature and good humor. I be-
lieve that, whatever her troubles, she would
have refrained from grumbling for fear that
her complaints might disturb the Almighty.
A plump-figured, plain-faced woman, her
countenance had no unpleasant lines, and its
cheerful good nature was good to look upon.
On the morning following my; arrival she
reached my room with a cup of tea and
some toast. This wasn’t at all in our bar-
gain.
“Oh, it’s no trouble,” she said. “I was
making some for myself and thought you
might like some. I hope you weren’t dis-
turbed last night.”
I said I wasn’t; but as a matter of fact
I had been. In the next room there appar-
ently lodged the tragic-faced girl I had
passed on the stairs. She had come in very
late. in the night, which, anyway, was no
business of mine, though my female relative
might have, considered it her business. Then,
shortly, I heard the sounds of restless toss-
ing, and moans and sobbing. Soon there
was a burst: “Oh, why aren’t I dead too?”
and “My little love! My little darling!”
After that more sobbing.
“There’s a girl in there, poor thing,” said
Mrs. Nicholls, "and I think she’s had a baby
and lost it, and can’t get over it.”
It was then tliat I really began to like my
landlady, because a previous one, instead of
havinc sympathy in her tone when mention-
ing a similar fact, had said that it was much
better as it was, and she thought she must
get rid <>f the girl.
“She’s a day waitress, and gets nine shil-
lings a week. I call that wicked,” she
added. “I don't think such things should be
allowed.”
“She may get over it in. time,” I said, not
knowing what else to say. “She’s very young
yet.”
“Yes; in the bright. Mexico of youth there
is no such word as ‘Nil Desperandum,! ”
sighed Mrs. Nicholls, as she went.
That rather staggered me; but I learnt as
time went on that one of my landlady’s
peculiarities was lengthy misquotation on
every possible occasion. Where she got hold
of the quotations she misused, or, how, having
got them, she got them all wrong, I cannot
say.
Still, the grief in the next room • remained
a nightly occurrence. And the tea came in
the morning and the conversations. I asked
her once if she had any children.
“I had one,” she replied—“by my first
husband.”
“Oh. you’ve been married twice, Mrs.
Nicholls?” T said.
"I’ve been married lots of times.” was her
surprising answer. “At least With my
first, I was only a girl_ at the time. The
week before we were going to be married
we bought a house and furniture, and Jack
said we might as well start straight off.”
This rather rattled me; but Mrs. Nicholls
pursued her theme with no embarrassment.
“So we stayed. You see, I thought he
might be disappointed. And then I did not
like to worry him by reminding him, and
time went on. Then the little boy was
born.”
“But you were married then?” I sug-
gested, awkwardly.
“He wouldn’t have been any better if we
were,” she said. “It wasn’t Jack’s fault,
anyway, but his wife turned up, and he went
back to live with her. He had to —there
were four children.”
“Is the little boy alive?” .1 said, hastily,
anxious to change the conversation a little.
“No, lie died,” she sighed, with genuine
sadness.
“That’s sad.”
“But I had him for eight years,” she said,
bravely, with a return of her cheeriness;
“and he was such a dear little fellow. I
can always think of his little ways! Reg
was awfully fond of him. Always when ho
got a shilling or so from me he gave him
threepence, or sometimes sixpence.
Beg was one of my lodgers—l married
him afterwards. He was a born gentleman,
and a clever man, too, but he couldn’t make
money, somehow ; and you couldn’t expect a
man brought up like he’d been to do hard
work. He owed me a lot of money, but I
couldn’t ask liim to go, of course. Then he
kept asking me to marry him, and I thought
we misrlit as well. It saved a room, anyway.
And , sometimes the poor man was hungry, I
know, and it saved that.
“It’s a strange thing how some people can
make money and others who are really clever
can’t. Now, I’ve always been able to, and
I’ve saved, and if a lodger couldn’t pay for
a while I didn’t have to bother about telling
him to go. %
“But Mark nearly got me into trouble—
Mark was the man who married me after
Reggie died. He was what yon call a smart
man; but he didn’t mean no harm. He put
in fifty pounds, and he got me to take a
bigger place; and we did well. But Mark
was fond of horse-racing, and he got into
trouble. A man is likely to get desperate
when he gets into trouble like that, and you
can’t blame him; but if it hadn’t been that
the people he .had sold the place to were very
good about it and rented the house to me
cheap, I’d have had a bad time that year.”
“But he couldn’t sell the place without
your signature,” I said. “You could have
fought them.”
“Oh, but they treated me very nicely. One
of them came and lived in the house. He
was; a nice man although a Jew, and his wife
had left him. He was always talking about
his loneliness, almost crying over it, and he
liked to be comforted. But, of course I
couldn’t marry him, we being both married ”
I’m sorry about -the little bov,” I said
hastily.
"I’d like to have’ him,” she sighed. “And
(hat’s why I’m sorry for that poor girl. I’ve
asked her -not to worry about the rent, but
Jo go about and enjoy herself a. hit,, and pick
up'her strength—and not to go out at night.
Lhat sot’t of thing’s a. mistake. But, as you
say, it takes a child to make a woman
happy.”
“Some women,” I said, “have many chil-
dren dnd are not happy.”
“Oh. some people go'too far.” she replied.
Later on I learnt about others who had
imposed on her. There was a ship’s captain
who wept over novelettes, and explained that
it was an awful thing for a man to have a wife
thousands of miles away from him in Eng-
land. He seemed to have lived free of board
for at least a year. And there was an actor
who complained that Art was unappreciated,
and swore repeatedly to kill himself in des-
pair. Mrs. Nicholls described him as a man
with a heart bowed down with weighty
woe.
When I left her house Mrs. Nicholls made
me give her a promise that I would return.
“ In spite of the proverb being about fields
and pastures new from which no traveller
returns, you must come,” she said.
I did go back; but it was months later,
lho door was opened for me by a laughing,
happy-faced woman whom it was difficult to
recognise as the tragical girl who had sobbed
m the room next to mine.
“Why. it’s you !” she cried. “Mother, look
who s here !”
Then, as Mrs. Nicholls came rushing out
with the sort of welcome that belonged to
her nature, the girl was for dashing up the
stairs again.
“I’m going to show him something!” she
called back gaily.
. “It’s, her. ( baby,” said Mrs. Nicholls. “It’s
.lust what she wanted, and she’s happy as
the day.” Then, afe an afterthought:
“Fred’s going to marry her next month. He’s
the lodger who came after you, you know.
He was as miserable as anything with doines-
tic trouble, and was drinking no end. But
they made up and they’re both happy now.
He couldn't marry her until his divorce was
absolute, you know !”
“Look at mv dinky little babekins.” said
the girl, bursting in upon us. “Aren’t I a
lucky mother?” ;
“And you,” I said to Mrs. Nicholls. after
I had ■ expressed the required enthusiasm,
"are grandmother,, I suppose? Or does
fairy godmother suit the case better?”
* fif- -* *
Before I left. I met a Captain Blake, an
elderly seafaring man. who. in spite of an
accident that had invalided him. looked very
much df home, and called Mrs. Nicholls
Linda. Perhaps that was the reason.
I met the proud mother with her babv in
the. city 1 some months later. She refused an
invitation to tea, because her husband didn’t
like-her having tea with other roen ;
“Well, how’s Mrs. Nicholls?” .I said.
“Oh. my husband and I hav'e taken a
place out,,at Habe.rfield.” she said rather
stiffly: "“I haven’t seen Mrs. Nicholls for
quite a long time.”
' There must have been something in the
look on my face that caused her to flush
with sofnething like shame.
“You,know, she’s not very respectable,”
she said defiantly.

The
Importance
Of
Efficient
Insulation!
The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test. and. further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has' been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
