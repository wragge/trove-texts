SATURDAY, MARCH 3, 18S3.
Mr. Redmond and his Critios.
More than a weak before Mr. Redmond, pirlia-
mcatary representative in the House of Commons
for New Ribs, and a member of the Irish Land
League, addressed a public aulienee in Sidney,
tne daily papers begj.ii a campaign against him.
Ths Bulletin remained silent. Mr. Redmond
was on his way hither, and an opportunity would be
afforded in duo course of hearing in full what he
had to say for the organization ha represents and
the cause he advocates. Comment founded upon
mere telegraphic condensations was to be regarded,
under the circumstances, as premature and un
stable. Tne people of the colony have had a
surfeit of telegraphic condensations of Irish affairs,
and it was a matter of common knowledge that
one object of Mr. Redmond’s visit was to en-
deavour to counteract the effects of telegraphed
information which the Irish contend is invariably
derived from partial and prejudiced sources. To
comment upon telegraphed condensations of his
remarks would, therefore, have been nugatory,
and would at the same time have given evidence
of a determined prejudice on one side or the other.
That the precipitation of the dailies was due to pre-
judice, has by this time been sufficiently demon-
strated by the almost frantic passion of their denun-
ciations of the man and hia cause, and the entire dia-
abloment of their faculty for reasonably analysing
his arguments, which that passion has occasioned.
That it was wise and just to wait until Mr Red-
' mond s arguments and all attendant facta were to
be learned direct and without trusting to inter-
mediaries is testified by one fact. Mr. Redmond s
lecture in Adelaide was succeeded by a lecture by
a Mr. Bilby, respecting which the Herald and
Daily Telegraph, each had a pretty full tele-
gram. That published in the Herald was so
framed as to convey the impression that Mr.
Eiley’s audience was an important one, and
representative of the p iople of South Australia
without distinction, and that the resolutions
adopted at hia lecture, and the ready applause
which was accorded to his arguments, represented
the feeling of disinterested colonists. TUe Tele-
gkaph’s message gave quite a different com-
plexion to Mr. Riley s meeting. It afforded the
information that “ There was a very meagre
attendance, and the proceedings throughout
were of a most partisan character, the
Orange feeling predominating." The circulation
of tne Daily Telegraph is so limited that
unfortunately this exposure of suppression
of essential facts by the Herald’s correspondent
could have small effect in correcting the false
impression conveyed by the Herald. The dis-
crepancy furnishes abundant evidence how im-
proper and unreliable have been comments founded
upon reports received from correspondents of
whom one or other was clearly so steeped in pre-
judice as on the one hand to suppress, or on the
other to invent, circumstances pregnant with signi-
ficance.
« * *
But it is a work of supererogation to demonstrate
that the dailies have been blinded by prejudice,
and swayed by passion. Of the hysterical wild-
ness of the Daily Telegraph, it is scarcely
requisite to speak. That journal has never
managed to exert any influence, and its profoundest
expressions of emotion have long since ceased to
excite any sentiment save amusement. It is, how-
ever, really remarkable to notice how tremendous
must be the prejudice and excitement which has
actually had violence sufficient to lash into a
splutter of passionate epithets the ordinary heavy
immobility of the Sydney Morning Herald.
ihat journal, which could find no stronger expres-
sion for the destruction of youth and female inno-
cence at Clontarf, than “ unbecoming," abso-
lutely foams at the mouth when confronted
with the task of answering Mr. Redmond s argu-
ments, and, in the course of au article of
singular incoherence and inconolusiveness, even
lor a Herald leader, apiti at Mr. Redmond
accusations of being “ saturated with passion and
®*xggeration,” and “ hot with human nate.” The
Herald futher signalises its fury by two very
thinly-veiled suggestions of the " Don t put him
under the pump " order. There is quite a flavour
0 disappoiutment in the remark, that ‘‘contrary
® expectation, there was no disturbance ”
■ “lr. Redmond’s meeting; and the hint at the
080 °fthe leading article, that— “If Mr. Reo-
ond hunself does not succeed in provoking dis-
1 fl 6r lU Sydney, w iH due, not to the want of
thrown down, but to the
n08s an( * self-restraint of the population,”
hid scarcely be broader.

cm °K S^6r^ the cause of Irish landlordism
iHorG-c j° °P no °lvable stretch of imagination be
Q 0 b.^ n , t b the actions of the population of
(South Wales, who assuredly do not regard
themselves as responsible for the infamies per-
petrated by that caste for their own advantage
upon the Irish people, it was strikingly absurd tor
the S.M. Herald to pronounce, as it did on
Saturday last, that Mr. Redmond bad no cause
to complain of the obstructions which ware
placed m the way of hia addressing the public,
" because the direct tendency of his oratory is to
stir up ill-feeling between the English and Irish
settlers in Australia.” The Wnglisu people have
not been particeps criminis in tna spoliation of
Ireland and the oppression of her people. How
many are there among our settlers who regard
themselves as responsible for the cruelties and
extortions of the laot four centuries—cruelties, be
it noted, which are nistoriual a id undeniable, and
extortions which are admitted by the legislation
of the last two years, expressly framed to moderate
them when it had become evident that they had
exasperated the victims to the point of rebellion?
It is not the English people whom the Land
Leaguers charge with iniquity, but the aristocratic
order, and plutocrats—the landlords —native as
well as foreign, resident as well as absentic.
The English and bcotch settlers of N.n.
Wales are perfectly aware that Mr. Redmond
is not accusing them of extortion and in-
humanity ; and wny it should be assumed
that they will begin to hate their Irish
fallow-colonists because an Irish member enlarges
upon the grievances duo to the selfishness of a
class which in all parts of the world presses more
than is just upon the industrious poor, is quite
incomprehensible. Mr. Redmond commenced
hia mission at a most unfavourable time.
The discovery of the assassins of Lord
Frederick Cavendish, and the disclosures
of tfie infamous Carey were announced
simultaneously with his appearance in this part of
the world. It has suited reverend editors to
accept every declaration of the informer as gospel,
and to refuse credence to a single statement wnioh
does not tally with the sensational disclosures
which the wretched Carey spews forth under the
pressure of a sickening anxiety to save his worth-
less life by gratifying hia captors with information
to suit their appetite In every system of justice
it is a recognised axiom that the uncorroborated aa-
serfcions of a criminal informer constitute the most
worthless of all evidence, and areonly to be received
with the extremest suspicion and utmost reserve.
Yet our would-be leaders of public opinion scorn
such discretion, and give unreserved credit to every
word uttered by Carey in his obvious desico to
diminish his own criminality by extending to the
utmost the radius of guilty participation. When
I sufficient time shall have elapsed forced imeiti-
gation of the informer s allegations, and tor silling
the true from the false, it will be possible to form
a sound judgment as to the compass of his credi-
oiiity a curious anomaly is presented by the
fact that the very j juruafs in Sydney which have
emphasized the fact that Mr. BarnELL is under
an uOIigation to explain his position wicU respect
to tue informer’s allegations, are those which
applaud the attempts made to prevent Mr. Red-
mond, who was anxious to explain, from being
heard at ail!
• • m
When Mr. Redmond’s deliverance is calmly
ex (.mined, it certainly contains nothing calculated
to irritate the susjeptiPilitios of tne people of this
colony. I here is no accusation against us. The
landlord proprietors or Ireland, and the plutocrats
who fill me British House of Commons and cer-
tainly do not represent the sentiments of the toil-
ing masses in Great Britain, are the parties
charged with misdeeds. i\ow south Wales is uot
populated by Dish landlords and members of the
House of Commons, and can listen to very harsh
attacks upon those individuals with disinterested
composure. 'J bat the classes who nave personally
profited by tbo spoliation of Ireland and the dis-
tresses of tfie people have succeeded in sowing
seeds of dislike to irishmen among the humbler
classes of Britons is true enough. But every day,
as intelligence awakens, the influence of artfully
inoculated disseution becomes diminished, and
already the more intelligent among the labour-
ing classes in England — skilled artizans and
so forth — have oast off these artificial and
spurious repugnances, and, under the stylo
of Radicals, openly express their shame for
the iniquities which have been perpetrated m the
name of the nation, and their abhorrence of the
violent measures—the perpetual Coercion Bills —
which drive their unfortunate brethren across fct
George s Channel to desperation. The settlers of
JNew South Wales are not less intelligent than the
artizans of Great Britain. They know they are
not accused, and they will pretend no irritation —
except they be persuaded that they are insulted,
and hounded on to violence by perniciiua prompt
inga-
Mr. Redmond scored an oratorical effect when
ho scornfully alluded to the unworthy suggestion
by a member of our legislature that he should be
authoritatively silenced. But he missed a point
when ha omitted to deduce the obvious moral from
the fact that the suggestion had been ineffectual.
He might, with crushing force, have contrasted
the freedom he enjoys in this appanage of the
British Crown, with the treatment which would
have been dealt out to him had he attempted to
speak with equal freedom in hia own country.
This is a home of freedom Ireland is not. If
the colony of New South Wales could be towed
from its foundations, and planted off the coast of
Great Britain it would be no thorn in England’s
side, as Ireland now is. Why should New South
Wales be loving and loyal, while Ireland is con-
vulsed with detestation of British rule? Thero
need be a tremendous reason for the difference.
Can anyone fail to see that the difference lies in
the treatment which has been meted out to each.
If the yeomanry of New South Wales were rack-
rented and insulted, outraged and plundered—
(remember that tbo outrages are historical and the
plundering admitted by reparative legislation)—
by a proprietary mostly absentee and almost in-
variably differing in race and religion, how long
would they remain loving and loyal? The colo-
nists of North America wore never subjected to
one hundredth part of the indignities and injuries
which have for centuries been showered upon the
Irish; yet they rose in rebellion. Only the dis-
tance which separated them from the mother
country, and the difficulties of transport at that
epoch, saved their revolt from being crushed in
the bud, and their chains re-riveted and doubled,
as attempted revolts by the people of Ireland
have been crushed and punished again and again.
Yet no reasonable Englishman to-day denies that
the Americana were justified in their revolt.
Surely, in the eternal name of Justice, it is not
success which justifies a revolt or an oppression!
And when one recalls the fact that the passion of
hate and misrepresentation with which the Ameri-
cans were regarded was nearly universal among
Englishmen at the time —the exceptions being
those in whose breasts the true sense of justice
triumphed over a blind and unreasoning national
sentiment, men will at this epoch scorn to permit
inflamed and passionate casuistry to obscure their
sense of what is true, just, and right.
• • •
There is a determined attempt here to identify
Mr. Redmond, as there has been in England to
identify Mr. Parnell, with the organizers of
assassination in Ireland. Beyond the mere bald
record that Mr. Parnell repudiated the charges,
and that his denials have not been acoeptedTn the
British House of Commons as sufficient, we are
without information, except the evidently partizan
cablegrams of the Herald’s London Corres-
pondent. But, luckily, Mr. Redmond’s presence,
and the fact that the attempts to gag him proved
ineffectual, enable the people of M.S. Wales to
judge what was the probable character of Mr.
Parnell’s protestations, as they were likely to
be analogous to those of Mr. Redmond. Let ns
consider how the evidence stands on each side.
A s against the leaders of the Land League it is
alleged, on the representations of certain landlord
organs, that there is a sum amounting to .£100,000
of L and League funds unaccounted for.
there are the statements of the caitiff Carey,
which, as they reach us, are that there existed
‘ an inner circle of assassins,” acting under the
direction of a mysterious person known only as
Number One, by whom they were supplied with
unlimited funds. These are positively all the
materials available for supporting a charge of
complicity against the public leaders of the Land
League. Now, as to the rebutting evidence.
First, it must be specially remarked that Carey’s
statement respecting an “inner circle,” filtered
though it comes through mediums which might
certainly be expected to give it the construction
most damaging to the cause of the Land League,
pn sents a remarkable indefiniteness in the essen-
tial particular. It does not allege that the “ inner
circle ” was part of the Land League organiza-
tion. Considering the strong anti-Irish colour
which cabled news from the special
correspondent has invariably borne, it is reason-
able to argue that had the connection between
the “ Assassin Committee” and the Land League
been specifically alleged, he would not have failed
to cable the fact in the most positive terms,
secondly, the evidence for the accusers itself
is distinct upon the point that the assassins
were not, to their own knowledge, sup-
ported or controlled by the leaders of the Land
League. They derived their inspiration and their
resources from a mysterious Mumber One, and
this figurative personage is, so far from being sup-
posed to be one of the open leaders of the League,
that a General Milne, formerly of the United
States army, is indicated as the man. There is
not yet a tittle of evidence to connect General
Milne, or Mumber One, with the Land League.
Then as to the money supplied, there is Mr. Red-
mond's categorical statement that just prior to
his departure from Europe the fundi of the League
had been audited by three men of character, and
the expenditure of every pound subscribed satis-
faoto.ily accounlel fi r. This might still leave an
unsatisfied doubt weie there no other known funds
from which the “Assassins Committee” could
have drawn their unstinted supplies. But as a
matter of fact, it was only the other day that com-
ment was made upon the circumstance that no
account had been given of a considerable propor-
tion of a fund entirely distinct from the League’s
collection, and not under the League’s control.

'Ihat is tho “Skirmishing Fund.” This is a
pignifi ;ant feature. Let us see how it runs. There
is no allegation except by unprincipled oommenta-
r >rs like tho Herald writers that the ' Inner
<’irole" was commoted with the Land League.
’< acre is an allegation that it was directed by an
/i meri , ;a. It is denied'that any portion of the
L ind Le iguo funds remains unaccounted for. _ It
1 , not (la-iied that largo amounts of the ‘ bkirmish-
3 ig Fund —a fund specially collected for purposes
«.f (1 iv--station —are unaccounted for in America.
(I'o d.-'lr the stronger presumption that the
‘ rikirioishing” funds supplied the assassins that
iu fact they got their money where they got their
iovier—and that they wore not indebted either for
1 ,>a lersiiip or pecuniary help to the Land League.
« • •
These considerations are ample to impress any
f.ir man wirh the propriety of at least suspend-
ing judgment respecting the responsibility of the
/.and League leaders. But their drift is amply
«: irrobmated by antecedent facts. It is inoontro-
v ;rtible that these leaders did from the formation
of the League publicly denounce violence of all
hind. This may have beeu a blind, but that snp-
j> isitiou is not endorsed by facts. It ia trne, that
until these leaders were imprisoned and their
organisation suppressed, crime and outrage ware
»>,fc a minimum, and that the suppression of their in-
ti 1 moa w as followed by overwhelming evidence that
rueic power had bean used to restrain, inasmuch
,u murder stalked through their unhappy country
tr im the day they were no longer able to exercise
c introl. it is true that they had no sooner come
to an understanding with Mr Gladstone’s Govern-
ment. and prepared to inaugurate a system of
mutual concessions and conciliations, than their
plans were shattered by theue assassinations. It
is true that they instantly denounced and lamented
the occurrence, and not only offered rewards for
the discovery of the assassins, but, in moving
terms, arraigned them as the worst enemies their
country had yet suffered from. Surely no news-
pviier reader can have so soon forgotten, that in
almist every quarter—certainly in every unpre-
judiced quirtar —the view was unhesitatingly
..dopted. f at there existed a party of irreoonoile-
abies. bitto ly hostile to the moderate counsels of
Mr. Parnell and hia associates, who had chosen
this desperate but effectual means to frustrate his
d«signa. J to make reconciliation between the
Hiitish P v liamemt and the Irish peopleimpossible.
it cannot urely be forgotten, that there wore cur-
rent as many rumours of Mr. Parnell’s life
being threatened by the desperate section, as there
were of Ir. Forster’s danger. When these
points ar duly weighed and deliberately pondered,
j-easonab!) people will perceive that they would be
untrue ti their manhood, were they to permit
themselv 3 to be hurried to premature conclusions

eeUors, iio have shown that they can neither

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Two Truants.
The ele ■ ors of Mudgea and of the Upper Hunter have
b fore them a peculiar task. They are, without their
ino inatiou being consulted, appointed referees ia a
most unusual combat. Mr. M'Elhone gave the chal-
lenge to this most senseless duel, and Mr. Taylor dis-
jilayed the chief defect iu his political character when
he accepted it. His constituency may, as suits itself,
elect either to be aggrieved by the uncalled for trouble
thrust upon it, or flattered oy Mr. Taylor's confidence
ia its aff ction. Wo should be exceedingly sorry to see
Mr. M’Elhone, who is chiefly culpable in this matter,
ns he cannot plead the excuse of youthful impetuosity,
succeed at Mudgee. Aud dfspite their errors of judg-
ment, it would be a pity to exclude either of the con-
testantfc from the House. The best thing the electors
could do under tho circumstances would be for those of
Mudgee to seal Mr. M'Elhone away, minus his £10
depo it, and for those of the Upper Hunter to give him
n plain hint thit ho may not trifio with impunity with
iheir oo \ddouce. Mr. M'Elhone's absence from the
House would be a positive misfortune. As to Mr.
Taylo : men of his uncompromising temper are sadly
‘wan e l iu tho House in larger proportion than they are
now to be found iu it. There are steady men in plenty
in the II >use, who are no use at all. There are men of
thorough “ propriety,” whose decency tabes the vicious
form of le’tlng any rascality pass sooner than appear
excited. It is for the electors of Mudgee to say
whether Mr. Taylor’s abilities outweigh his value as a
counterpoise to the monotonously respectable blinkers
at imposture and fraud who throng iu the Lcgislative
Assembly.

The bitterest curse to Ireland has been that class of
patriots who serve their country only by skulking be-
hind a hedge— or a curtain.
Rival Critics.
The Echo has thought proper to allot its Melbourne
correspondent place in its columns to discharge his
bile upon Mr. Alfred Mont, in reference to the
brutal assault made upon the latter gentleman by a
theatrical bully. Now, the Echo knew that its cor-
respondent, Dr. Neild— the man who in The Herald
metaphorically spat upon the coffin of Marcus Clarke
—is a rival dramatic critic, and hates Moul like poison.
The co doctors of the Argus and Australasian, for
which Dr. Neild writes, would not for a moment have
permitted him the indecent license of attacking his
rival in their columns, so he tries to find a rent for his
venom in the Echo, and—succeeds 1 The disclaimer of
agreement with Dr. Nbild’s ideas, which the editor of
the Echo appends as a footnote to the etfnsion, does
not greatly mend the matter. The jealous man got
the chance he wanted of vilifying his competitor. He
represents Moul as “ comparatively ” tall, and so
insinuates cowardice. This should be particularly
effective ia Sydney, where, of course, Mr. Mqjjl’s
appearance is not familiar as it is in Melbourne. But
we have ouee seen Moul ourselves, and we therefore
happen to know that the ascription of “ comparative "
tallness by his rival conceals a “ positive” lie. Moul
is a slight and distinctly delicate-looking man, of less
than mo inm height. But that is not his offence in
Dr Nrn.os eyes. The fact is that Moul is, beyond
comparison, the mere oompetr-nt musical critle. Ha
j i himself a musician and a composer, whereas the
Doctor, although a first-class dramatic eritlo—when
kw prejudices or inclinations do not sway his judgment
—just so much knowledge of music as he picked
tap dugoig the last few years. Originally, he did not
pretend to undertake musical criticism. The Argus and
Australasian used to employ a specialist for opera and
business. But since musical drama has almost
entirely supplanted the legitimate, Dr. Nkild’s occupa.
tlon, like Othlllo’s, was gone, had he not been inspired
with the conception that he could rah along very com-
fortably as a suddenly inspired musical judge, if he only
tried—just as Jimmy Williamson discovered that ho
was a competent basal vocalist, and that Maggie Moore
had been a regular Prima Donna without knowing it,
all tho time she was gabbling Yankee Dutch and dancing
Irish jigs, Possibly it is a feeling of fellowship in this
regard which helps to make Dr. Nbild so furious at
Moul for objecting to be beaten to a jelly for pronounc-
ing that Maggie ia not his ideal of a leading soprano,
or of the delicately gay Masootte. Anyhow, Dr. Neild
had better have kept his mouth shut about Moul, who,
as a critic, is surpassing him as distinctly as the Age
for which Moul writes has given the go-by in circula-
tion, influence, and everything else to the Argus, which
is Nexld’s shelter. Neild is perfectly well understood
—and loved—in his dual capacity of critic physician,
throughout the “perfesh.”

Judge Noel, of the Northern District Court ol
Queensland, U the jenngest; man on the Bench of the
sister colony- He is an able man, however, and has
probably not been long enough identiflsd with the law
to have had his sense of justice blunted. This point
we owe to a remark once dropped (probably after dinner)
by Judge Lutwyohe, answering District Court Judge
Hurst. The old roan said Hnrst knew very little law,
bpt his decisions gave less trouble than any other Solon
On tho Queensland Bench. If that isn’t a left.handed
way of saying law is not justice, give us a J.P..ship.

Sensational divorce case down South. “ The
unfortunate husband is of a confiding nature, and
while deluded with cant and hypocrisy, has been the
dupe of the man who has destroyed his domestic
happiness.”
Everyone remembers “ Mrs. Henderson,” the
“ lady” who travelled with Henderson, the clever scamp
whore floating store, the famous ship Ferret, was seized

the divorced wife of a certain gentleman who has just
been married with some 6clat.
O’Leary, the world’s champion 'athlete, called

Miss Clarke, who was one of the fair attendants
on Miss Ada Ryan, on the occasion of her being con-
verted into Lady Charles, is the young lady whose Pa
(Sir William Clarke) “declined the honour "—on her
behalf—of a matrimonial alliance with Viscount
Dupplin, eldest son of the Earl of Kinnoull. Dapplin
has gone tho pace; he married a daughter of the Earl
of Fyie; she bolted with Mr. Herbert Flower, who
married her after Dupplin got a divorce. Flower is a
son of a well-known merchant, formerly of (Sydney and
Melbourne. Cyril, the eldest son, manied Miss
Rothschild, sister of the Countess of Rosebery.
Thus a Melbourne correspondent :—Lord Charles
Soott, who has been conquered by a Melbourne lady,
isn’t bv any means a splendid young aristocrat, in the
first flash of youth and rolling in riches. On the other
hand, he’s nearly fifty and bald-headed, and—ahem—
this isn’t tho first time be has been married. Sir W. J.
Clarke, the newly-made Victorian baronet, who ia con-
nected by marriage with the (air bride, is credited with
the landing of the fish, who, as already indicated,
hasn’t many golden spots on him. Sir William, on the
other hand has, as all the world (of Australia) knows
ever so many thousands a year. Mere we again say—
ahem 1 It was for a good while understood that
Ghawles had “ backed out;” but after Sir W. J, and the
bride’s father, Mr. Ryan, a Melbourne stock agent, had
visited and returned from England, the high-toned
peop e of Melbourne became aware that it was “til
serene ” The A»ecs, wbich published a very elaborate
account of the smajt wadding, has apparently not seen
that his Lordship gave a very palpable snub to those
who at the breakfast referred to bis ancestry, when he
remarked that “all people had ancestors of some sort or
another." The remark was no doubt keenly felt by the
baronet, who naturally thought of the butcher’s shop
of his father in Tasmania. Oh! and one of the brides-
maids is said to be engaged to a member of Mr. Ivo
Biigh’s cricketing team. Sundry efforts have been made
to trap the hon. Ivo, but so far they don’t appear to
have been successful.
Our Gods.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
See the publio kiss the rod.
Bowing down before its god;
Grovelling low upon the ground.
Listen to that swelling sound
Which the crowd of grovellers raise
In their idol’s lofty praise.
Upward to the vaulted sky
Rolls the anthem loud and high ;
Over mountain, over saa,
Over valley, over lea;
Hallelujahs far and near
bmite upon the listening ear.
What is it which devotees
Worship thus on bended knees.
Hymning ever, day by day.
With enthusiastlo lay.
Weary never, never faint—
Is it martyr ? Is it saint P
Is it planet, sun, or star,
Soaring in tho Heavens afar P
Or the new moon’s orescent pale.
Milky-way, or comet's tail ?
No, ah! no, 'tis none of these
That they praise on bended knees.
What is this strange god they serve ?
Is it Beauty’s graceful curve,
la it literature or art
Which absorbs their mind and heart P
No, by snored camels’ humps I
'Tis a bat 1 a ball 11 and S tUMPS 111
Shades of Hamer, Cicero,
Horace, Virgil, here’s a go I
Ye whose nurse wac wont to hum
Lays of ancient heathendom ;
Saw ye ever jet a ‘chump"
Worshipping a ball and stump ?
Ye, who erstwhile bent your knees
To Olympian deities.
Ye who hymned the moon and stars —
Venus, Jupiter, and Mars —
Did ye ever see a flit
Bowing down before a bat ?
In the Bible we are told
How tho Israelites of old
Bsnt the knee to Aaron’s calf—
We havo long been used to laugh
At their bovine deity,
Aud re-veal ed theology.
Are we wiser much than they
In our wisdom of to-day ?
Reverencing (how passing odd I)
Spofforth as a demi-god ;
At Lord Byron’s pooms sniffin’,
Eulogising Boyle and Giffin P
At “high art ” we daily scoff—
Who ii Frith ’longsida of Spoil ?
Rosa Boaheur’s choicest “ bits ’’ —
What are they to Bonnot’s hits ?
Ruskin’a writings no one knows.
All have heard of Cooper's “ slows.”
Should Macaulay’s shade appear,
’Twould be little honoured here 5
Hang all literati, please.
From Tom Moore to Sophocles—
We know naught of Attic plays.
But we know all Garrett’s ways!
Literature aside is tossed,
“ Paradise Regained " and •' Lost ”
Moulders with (how very sad I)
Pope’s immortal Illi&d;
Milton’s smallest among *'spuds"
When compared with England's Btudda.
Wo don’t want poetic lore
While Bill Murdoch’s to the fore;
Give us but a bowling-green.
And the French can have Racine;
We don’t covet their Rousseau—
Of a Massie we can blow!
Perish memories of Voltaire,
Bourepauz, and Moliere ;
Why should men account them wise
When they knew not “ wides” from “ byes ?”
Nor (what wonder that we scoff)
“ Long field on ” from “ long field off ?”
What is literary lore
To a “ tally " or a " score ?”
Raise no queries, “ but ” no “ buts •
What are epigrams to “ outs ?”
Hurl down Wisdom’s sacred fanes.
Cherish muscles, perish brains I

Administered In a worm bath is the only method
by which every muscle, nerve, and bone, can be affected
at the same time. It removes chronic liver complaints,
congestion, tumours, rheumatism, &o., and rids the
iystem of all impurities ; even mercury is taken out of
the body.

The immediate effect of Moore’s Electric Bath is
more wonderful than Moore’s Household Remedy Oint-
ment, which removes all pain from a burn or scald in
three to 15 minutes. It is the only ointment that has
certificates of merit from the managers of all the
foundries in Sydney. It acts magically in wounds,
bruises, sores, sun-burns, corns, bunions, and has a
curative effect on lung complaints, when rubbed into
the chest. Every Householder should keep a pot.

Her Majesty is expecting an accession of grand-

The late General Chanzy was a brilliant soldier,
who came, however, to the front late in his career.
His military experiences were gamed in Algeria, his
advancement at Solferino and Magenta, and his death
was sudden. He rose from a game of whist, and re-
turned to his residence, looked in to his wife, and
retiring to his own room, died alone.
Mrs. Clara Morgan, some years ago one of the
best vocalists in Sydney, died recently in Qladesville
asylum. Her history is a melancholy one. She was a
charming girl, with a magnificent voice, and married a
man who, while her mind wan temporarily deranged,
wus killed by a fall from his horse in the streets of
Sydney. Now the gifted and brilliant little lady is
dead. She died in a lunatic asylum.

K&ve a children's party, and presented everyone there
with a "costly” gift. They also "devoted themselves
untiringly to tho entertainment of the little ones.”
When in Egypt they devoted themselves untiringly to
another pursuit. That was getting holes drilled through
the members of their family who stood between them
and the throne. They are practically exiled.
The blatant Ebenezer Cooke, who talks figures
glibly, has at last received his appointment of Audit
Commissioner at Adelaide. While in the House he did
not obtain universal credit for skill in financing. The
fact that every intelligent ratepayer is furnished with
tho opportunity of facetiously declaring that the ac-
counts will "now be Cooked," should alone have pra-
vented the appointment, on the part of a Ministry
having no basis but popularity—real or—a golden “ or”
—assumed.
Ministers of the Crown are in N.S.W. held in
high respect. The Hon. the Minister of Public Instruc-
tion was on Saturday last crossing Pitt-street to get
into a 'bns, and in doing so placed himself in the way of
a dray, the driver of which requested him to " Hat out
of the way, you (crimson) fool! ” The honourable gentle-
man at onoe complied with the request, and 11 glodo”

which has done so much in the way of endearing him
to the electors,
‘‘I met Oscar Wilde in London once,” said
Madame Christian Nilsaon-Kouzeaud the other day,
“ where we were both guests, and he was to taka me
down to dinner. He commenced to talk his nonsouso.
and pose to me, as we ware going to the dining room. I
said to him : • Look here, Mr. Wilde, I will put up with
no such stuff. That is all put on, and there is nothing
in it but nonsense.’ Mr. Wilde raid : ‘ Thank yon. Vou
are tho first sensible woman and true friend that I’ve
met ‘ After that he noted as a man should, and talked
sensibly.’'
As an instance of the ridiculous lengths to which
worship of "the grand old man,” Mr. Gladstone, is
carried in England, we may refer to the fact, that the
papers are siobbering their admiration of the fact that
' “a consumptive lady" sent him a book-mark, and ha
■« wrote a nice note acknowledging the donation. Despite
* the fatuousness of our daily papers, wo don’t think they
• have fallen to such a depth of silliness as this. Wo
can’t imagine any but the Daily Telegraph raptu-
rausly recording the circumstance, for example, that
Sir Henry Parkes had written a grateful note to the
donor, on receipt of a fan from a small-pox patient at
Little Bay.
Arabi Pasha, on being brought into the court to
receive his sentence, walked to the dook with a firm
step. He looked pale, and occasionally betrayed emo.
tion by the quivering of his lip. He was wonderfully
changed j almost, indeed, so as to be past recognition,
since seven months before, when he was at the zenith
of his power. He had lost much flesh, and had grown
a long gray board. After sentence had been pronounced
be walked back to his prison with an indifferent air,
receiving on the way a handsome bouquet of roses from
the wife of one of his counsel.
On the 13th February, Mr. M’Elhone said in the
Assembly that Mr. Edward Bebello, had not certain
documents been destroyed, would have been convicted
in Queensland of a criminal offence, and further, that
“ r kebello had been dismissed from the secretaryship
of the Reform Club. Mr, Eebello, in reply, observes
that if Mr. M’Eihone has a particle of manliness iu his
whole composition he will withdraw and apologise for
those statements, which are entirely untrue, or repeat
them outside the walls of the Assembly, in order that
the parson affected by his slander may have an oppor-

Even those who are most impatient of the hum-

tK u k 0 ads of Frenchmen generally measure less
than those of most other European peoples. Among
tue heaviest brains ever weighed were those of Cuvier
ana of Lord Byron, yet Byron wore an unusually small
aat, a characteristic which ho shared with Shelley and
Aeates. Leigh Hunt remark 0 , not without a touch of

It is not generally known that the Kaiser of
Germany and the Crown Prince are on cool terms.
William, it may be remarked, has a (food many of the
sunny social proclivities of George the First (of glorious
memory), and one morning the Bed Prince having im-
portant business with the Emperor, sought his apart-
ments without ceremony, by a private stair. On tne
landing ha mat a fat woman, with her hair in curl-
papers, and a dusky flannel gown. *' How, demanded
the Irince of an equerry who stood near— how is it
that the Palace sweepers are allowed on the Emperor s
staircase?" “That’s not a sweeper," your Highness,
was the reply, “that’s"——. Anyhow,
young William saw his dad, he perceived that he was
huffed. So, as wo have said, they are cool.
Commodore Vanderbilt’s widow is a prize, as
she is not much over 40, and has the interest on a
legacy o! £160,000, that is, about £200 a week. She was

tied, her This reminds ns of some other widows.
Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin all married

Bead Burly Johnson, the dictionary man and Howard,
the philanthropist, married widows. Nanoleon married
a widow. Josephine Beiaharnais Sir Wm. Heraohel,
after climbing up to 50 as a bachelor, married a widow.
It he hadn’t, wo’d still be looking for Sir John
Hcrsohel. Mahomet, at 25, married a widow of 40. And
the Eev. Peter Campbell married a widow. But the
Campbells aren’t coming. D’ye hear, Peter P
Lieutenant Colonel (3 A. Volunteers) Lovely
has departed for a visit to the old country, and suffered
banqueting. V ilunteer braves are always departing for
the old country. When this particular Lovely married,
some years ago. another particular Lovely, a well-known
carter on the stand, having been shunted by the Lieu-
tenant Colonel as an inconvenient relative, advertised
himself as being " the undo of that Mr. Lovely what
married Miss ," eto. This last Lovely feels proud
at present to flud his nephew so handsomely treated.
He had some pies and hot tripe with coffee from the pie-
stall in King William-street just about the time that
Msjah Jack Adam Fairgusson was bearing testimony to
the exalted merits of Lieutenant Colonel Lovely.
Moral: Always despise your lowly relations if you
happen to bea born proletarian, and you will prosper—in
South Australia, anyhow. It may be different in N.S.
Wales.
At Adelaide, Edward Lipsefct is going to sue
Dixon, M.P., lor libel. Edward was a draper’s assistant
a little time since, and is remarkable for his stature.
He has struggled rankly upward to an altitude of bit.
7in., and fancies now he is big enough for anything.
After coming to grief as a country storekeeper, Edward
removed to Adelaide, and made the acquaintance of
Dr Gorger, an uncouth but clever German sawbones,
who went through the Franoo-Prussian war, and to-day
does a large medical business. Giirger found Edward
some money and Edward went in for land speculation,
and came ofct very well But meanwhile he tried
oompany-mongering, and it is in respect to some impu-
tations cast on his conduct in this latter capacity by
Dixon that proceedings have been instituted. But the
lawyers will, as usual, have the oyster. Mora than one-
thitd of Lipsett’s income is spent in coat-tails. He is
so tall, and his coat-tails are so long, that, it is cal-
oulated, were he to use short sac coats, every poor
man. woman, and child in the colony might, out of
the difference iu coat, be supplied with three glasses
of beer and one nobbier daily. It is aggravating to
think that all this money will find its way into the
pockets of blear-eyod Symon, or Land-Loagning
Charley, or foozle-brained Bundey, or Chinaman
Downer, or meat-axa profiled Porter.
The news has come to na that George R. Sims
(“ Dagonet’’) is how a confirmed invalid. Here, now,
is another victim to the piling together of pieces.
There is something very sad in seeing a young man of
eo much promise broken up almost at the outset of ms
career. Sims suffers from weak eyes, and is now quite
unable to stand the London climate. But he is rich,
and he is writing another play far Wilson Barrett, so
will bo richer still. Then, like Trollope, he will die.
Let’s see 1 How long has Trollope been dead. Bay a
month. Well, people don’t talk about Trollope now
very much, and yet his work is as far above Sims’s as
the sun is above the corn-fields. How many of oar
dramatists will live, we wonder ? Look at Oxenford,
who was dramatic oritio of the Times for 20 years, and
wrote about 70 plays. Who ever hears of him now?
Edmund Falconer’s name has almost faded from our
remfembranoe ; and poor Planohd is known more as
Somerset Herald, in a court suit, than as a playwright.
Gilbert cannot live, for the simple reason that satirists
seldom do—a notable example being found in the
oblivion into which Churchhill has fallen. No one
remembers even the names of poor George
Bose’s comedies; and the works of Gilbert a Beckett
are in a similar predicament. Perhaps H. J. Byron has
the best chance of being remembered a hundred years
hence. Perhaps.
The hon. member who represents the electorate
of Hartley was twelve years ago an apprentice in the
Manning Biveb News printing office, then owned by
Dr. Horace Dean. Like Parkas, in his early manhood,
Walter was a poet, and published an epic poem, which
was considered by his intimate friends to bo equal, if
not superior, to the best efforts of Byron. After serving
his apprenticeship, rargett went away to Melbourne,
in which city he landed with the traditional half-crown
in his pooket. He obtained employment as a grass
hand at the Age office, from thence was promoted to a
full frame on a country paper, and shortly after ob.
tained a chance of starting a paper on his own account
at Castertou. His venture was successful. In twelve
months he sold out for a thousand pounds cash, and
returned to N.S.W. Since then ho has owned, edited,
and printed a paper in the electorate he now represents.
He learned a great deal from his old master. Dr. Dean,
who was returned for the Hastings electorate in the
general election of 1870, but was unseated on the peti-
tion of the brilliant B. B. Smith, the committee dis-
qualifying him because at the time of nomination he
held an office Of honour and profit under the Crown.
He was Postmaster with a salary of £10 a year. Dr.
Doan, however, again contested the election, and on
this occasion beat his opponent by a majority of 900
votes. B. B. Smith again petitioned, and the Dr. was
ousted because, although he had been living in the
colony fifteen years, and his children were ail born and
bred in the country, he had the misfortune to have been
born in America, and had not taken out papers of natura-
lisation. He was, therefore, disqualified, and the seat
given to E. B. Smith, Thus virtue triumphed.
Two sub-editors recently died in London —Mr.
John Allen, for 18 years sub-editor of the Moening
Post, and Mr. Stephen M’Konna, sub editor of the
Evening News It is a curious fact, by the way, that
two-thirds of the prominent English journalists have
been in the army. This, perhaps, accounts for the
cringing servilty with which nearly every newspaper
speaks of the “ hupper suckles." Puttin* aside Forbes
and Colonel Eichards. editor of the Moening Advee*
tisee, both of whom wo know to have been soldiers, it
is not difficult to perceive that the man who does en
passant for the Fiqaeo is an army man; that “ Euffler,”
in Vanity Pair, is in the Guards; that both Yates' and
Labouohere’s subs are military men; and that the
Whitehall Eeview slobbercrs are closely connected
either with the Admiralty or the Horae Guards.
Colonel Eichards. however, is a bit of a republican, in
his way. When Irving produced Wills’ *• Cnarles I.,”
at the Lyceum, by wht of taking the other aide of the
question, the gallant Colonel wrote a sonorous tragedy
m blank versa called “Oliver Cromwell," and Henri-
etta Hodson (Mrs. “Lahby”) produced it at the
Queen’s—her theatre in Long Acre. There was some
great writing in the piece, but it didn’t “catch on,”
somehow. And, talking of editors and their dramas, we
may mention that we get an exchange from America,
excellently got up, styled Mcsic and Drama; a paper
devoted to the professions its title implies, but vary
indifferently written. Music and Drama is edited by
one John G. Freund (himself a playwright), and you get
John C. Freund all through the paper until yon are
bored to death. Well, ten years ago, J.C.P, was in
London, and “a drama of intense interest,” by Sir
Charles L. Young, Bart, having proved a failure at the
Queen's, Mr. Freund persuaded Mrs. Labouohere to
produce his play in four acts, “ The Undergraduate.”
That representation was the noisest first night we were
ever present at. The piece was “ chi-acked *’ all
through, and the author having been called for and
hooted, the curtain descended amidst derisive boo-boos.
Yet, Mr. John C. Freund seems to be a big man in New
York, now. And, isn’t he just down on other dramatic
authors!
The coming richest man in America is likely to
bo Crocker, of the Californian Eailway Syndicate. The
company does not go by this name, but as its head-
quarters are in San Francisco, the name is handy. It
consists of four men—Crocker, Stanford, C. P. Hun-
nigtrn, and a shadow. They have the control of all the
lines connecting with the Eastern States, and have, so
far, successfully frozen out all other speculators who
have tried to run lines from the east into California.
Jay Gould is their only fear, and so far even he admits
that they have bluffed him. They have carried their
Southern Pacific line right down through Arizona and
Texas, and so on to New Orleans. While this was
being done, C. P. Hunnington quietly bought up a little
railway running from one of the beat harbours on the
Atlantic coast to nowhere. He got it for an old song,
as it had then nearly ruined its projectors. Everybody
thought him a madman with money and a taste for rail-
way management. By and by he bought another line
a little further south. As this also ran from no place
to nowhere, everybody thought him madder still. But
ho went on buying, until he bought up all the hues
between Newport and Now Orleans. And then, when
it became known that he was a partner in the firm of
Crocker, Stanford, and Co., and the engineers of the
firm were tssen surveying routes for lines to connect ail
the little roads he had bought up, and so run the
Southern Pacific railway right to the Atlantic seaboard,
the pabiic opened its eyes. This is the way that little
game was worked. The Syndicate have lately made a
bold bid for the carriage of Australian wool, and will
probably, before very long, complete y out out the sail-
ing ships in this traffic Stanford spends some of his
money on trotting-horses. He owns fifty or sixty.
Besides, he has a taste for art—or display. These
words are as nearly synonymous on the Pacino coast
of America as they are on that of Australia. But
Crocker has no taste for art, or, if he has, successfully
restrains it. Ha just sits up in his eyrie, and whenever
he sees some moan little railroad going begging, he
swoops down upon it and works it into his “ system.
That’s why he is likely to be in time to come the
richest man in America.
The statement that Mr. Parnell’s rents have
been reduced by the Land Commission is incorrect.
None of his tenants have applied to the Laud Court, all
of their rents being considerably below the Government
valuation. Mr. Henry Parnell, brother of the Irish
leader, is the gentleman whose estate has been proved
to be highly rented. With reference to Mr. C. 8.
Parnell's tenantry, Mr. Redmond, M.P., tells an amus-
ing aneodote. The hon. member for Now Ross formed
one of a shooting party last August to one of the grouse
mountains belonging to Mr. Parnell, in Wicklow, On a
portion of the mountain they found a flock of sheep. It
is unnecessary to say that the presence of sheep on a
grouse mountain during the breeding and shooting
season is most injurious to the game, and Mr. Parnell
was enraged at finding them there. He walked down
with his friends to a comfortable cot at tho base of the
hill, and said ho would let them see him exercising some
of the rights of a landlord. As the party approached
the house the tenant came out bareheaded to welcome
“the masther.” “ Whitty," said Mr. Parnell, “you
are a hardened old soonndiel. For the benefit of these
gentlemen (turning to tho shooting party) I will explain
what I have done tor you. Five years ago you were
evicted from a neighbouring estate. I found yourself,
your wife aud children on the ditch side. I brought
yon here, built this house, and gave you this farm at a
moderate rent, with permission to graze your cattle on
the mountain, free of charge, duritg the whale of the
year, except the breeding and shooting season, and you
promised me to see that your sheep did not interfere
with the game. From that day to this you have never
paid me one farthing rent, and I now find that you aie
not honourable enough to keep your promise about the
grazing." Whitty looked very much ashamed, and
begged the Irish leader's pardon. This is a specimen
instance of Mr. Parnell’s manner of treating his sonants.
A year ago, Parnell called together the entire body of
tenantry, and handed them clear receipts for all arrears
of rent to that day. So that although every landlord
in Ireland benefits to soma extent by the Arrears Act,
Mr. Parnell has not received one penny of the money
voted by the State towards liquidating the debts of tho
tenantry of Ireland.
Oscar Wilde was kind enough to inform the
Americans that their great detect is want of manners.
He said it is a problem the people will have to study,
that of cultivating more civilised manners. But most
people who read what Bill Nye said to him thought
Oscar would have been happier if he’d held his tongue
This is how Nye arraigned the Lank One:—“Yes,
Oscar, yon are, in a measure, correct. Oar manners
are a little decayed. So, also, were the eggs we gave
you in some of our cities when we found out what you
were. We don’t want to be harsh on foreigners who
come to this country in deshabille, and lecture to us
on the “ whence," and call our attention to tho con-
tiguity of the “ immediate." We westerners mav not
be as refined as you are. We may drink out of the
finger bowl in a moment of thoughtlessness, but we
greeted you, Oscar, with all our great wealth of earnest,
cordial hospitality, and put you in tho best bedroom
that opened oil the parlour, and we just turned you
loose among our brio-a-brao as though you had been a
cultivated gentleman, until we found you only an im-
ported ass. When you wiped your nose on a liver-
coloured handkerchief, or smiled and showed the
world your wealth of palate, did we laugh at you ? No,
we did not. Now, with your kniokerbocker pockets
full of American dollars, you go away and intimate that
tho American people use manners that are decayed.
You ought to be as named of yourself. You came to us
with a sun-flower and a glad smile, and you returned
with money enough to keep you from want as long as
your unprofitable life is spared. You came to us with
your teeth sticking out into the uncertain future aud
your shoulder-blades bathed in the glorious past, aud
you said to us: ‘I am the advance agent of true ait; 1
am the long-legged avant-courier of the blue butter-jar,
with the consumptive lily painted on it. I come to an-
nounce a great reform in decorations for the world.’
Was it strange then that wo initiated you, with ancient
eggs, into a crude style of decoration that was new to
you ? Can’t you see wo are a wild and barbaric people ?
How can you oxpeot us, with our isolated chances of
seeing people like you and learning the correct thing,
to know just how to act ? Because Providence planted
you in the midst of gospel privileges, and gave you the
advantages of early education, so that you can sign
your name in a way no living man can read it, you are
now going to hold us up to ridicule, are ycu, ycu white-
liverud cadaver witn moth-eaten lungs, just because, as
a nation, we pick our teeth at the table with the sugar-
tongs, and rob the home of tho setting hon, that we
may fill the bosom of the bogus lecturer with fragrant
memories of this free land ? That’s no way to treat a
healthy, growing people, Oscar; and you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.”

A a the year went out, Gambetta died. With
less passed away the most conspicuous figure in y.,
politics of Franco. Oa the last evening of last year
there was a sight in the Villa D'Avray in great Pani
that will bo long remembered. Under the Very roof

ot his greatest comedies, a tragedy wag being played to
Its end t L6on Cl .mbetta, the great republican leader

tor an effidal reception; only tho scared faces of e«r.
vants flitting to and fro, and the strange tkoitement of
harrying, whispering visitors, as they poured up tk«
carriage drive and thronged the entrance, suggested the
impending—the new certain—calamity. A memorable
scene was that of Gambetta surrounded on his last bed
by wonder stricken friends, and tended by the woman
to whom, the world says, he owed his death. There ii
little doubt cf this; bub equally little that It waa
th-oigh an accident, and her giief when compelled
flaaily lo leave the chamber of mourning was terrlbla
to witness. Little is positively known of “ Madame

was all for France, but his patriotism was not perspica-
cious His bias was often very strong, and in so siroag
a man it cou'd not bo d sregardtd. Commercial and
political negotiators often had to consider, not bo much
wbat actually was, but how Gimbetta would think It
was, for hie individuality of opinion was a ruling power.
He was identified indissolubly with the idea cf that
war of revenge for tho mutilation of France which It
supposed by many to ha inevitable sooner or later. Hu

nation by being blind lo what all other eyes could e«e,
that France wsb hopehssly beaten by Germany.
Whether or not he would ever have been able to enjoy
that retaliation he cherished, is bard t > say ; but it la
an open secret that Gombelta held the threads of an
elaborate intrigue with Russia, by which the two
Powers designed to attack Germany when the tima
came Of his fortune, rumour is vague. During hla
Presidency of the Chambers, his stipend was £2100a
year, yet part of the timu he only received the salary of
a simple deputy, £360 He was paid £960 as director
of tho Kepubliqde Fbancaisb. He was a bon vivant, if
not a winebihbcr, and spent money freely on'personal
luxury. He was a iravo and bold man, yet snperati-
tious Of course his death had been predicted by seeia
numberless times; but, of jourse, it is only afterbia
death that all those wonderful omens, presentiment!,
and prophecies of it first come to light. Its manner
probably will never be oleirly known, but the world ii
content to believe that in a struggle with Madams
Ldonide I dm, a revolver went off. He was sketched
when dead bv a great artUt, and bnried with the tri-
colour ronud him.
The Victorian general elections. Mr J. J.

makes his appearance in the Victorian Parliament as as
ind pendent member. He is a schoolmaster by pro-
fcation, and is a co-religionist of the pig-vote knight.
Mr. Madden was formerly somewhat celebrated aa as
athlete, and was an accomplished performer over
hurdles. Mr. John Murray, who had the temerity to
oopose Mr. J. G. Francis at Warrnamboo', is a yoang
Victorian, a fellow ot infinite jest, and decidedly demo-
cratic opinions. A clover speaker and brilliant con-
versationalist, he should have been either in Parliament
or at the Bar years ago. He made a very respectable
fight, and will no donbt air bis Johnsonian peri-tda in
the Assembly when the potato village has forgotten
Francis, and emerged from its present very respectable
condition of foggy fossilisation. Mr. Murray (who ii
of Scottish extraction and ostensibly a Presbyterian)

of Ireland—which outrageous avowal was altogath
too much for the local Jingoes, deacons, and elder

Miss Eloiae Juno advertises that her impersona-
tion of Jennie Deans-, "has been pronounced by Pro-
#!«or Rla-kie of the Edinburgh University, and the
entire English Frees (our italic*), to true tepresen-
totion of boott's immortal heroine Miss Juno is
wodesc enough to say no moro ; and for that we rather
like her We learn that tho play (which is an adapts-
tion dear Alfred, of the “ Heart g£ Midlothian") was
Written expressly for Miss Juno by “ Sefton Wald-
fra™, Etq ** Well, we never heard of Sefbon Wald-
erav,.’. Efq., before; and don't suppose we ever shall
again, for it is the biggest certainty m the world that
someone who has seen his drama has c’ubbed him into
eternity long ago.
• • •
Miss Juno evidently considered that to bring a
string of actors here, and to indulge iu plentiful
would b« sufficient to fill the Academy cf
Mnsio- Me. iBuoket, it will be remembered, said to
Mr Smallweed. on that worthy endeavouring to black-
mail bir Leicester Dadlock-" Do ywu know the reason
why the pig had his throat cut?” “No." snarled
Hmallweed. “ Well, I'll tell you," was the response;
“because he had too much chi ek " “ The bearings of
this observation lies in tho application on it" Asa
matter of fact, since M’sa Juno's advent here, there
have been, as a rule, almostas many people on the stage
as in tha hall. The only difference between the
two sets is that the cheetfni faces of tho actors
present a marked contrast to those of the audi-
ence On our arrival in Scotland, we discovered
the Laird of Dumbiedykes making love to Madge Wild-
fire and suggesting, we are sorry to chronicle giddy
things. Shortly after this Jennie interviewed her sister
in prison. The cloth that had been painted for Effie's
dungeon was peculiar. It looked line a skating rink
that had been made into a railway-tunnel, and then
metamorphosed into a fish-market. The interview was
most affecting It took place in Scotch —with the ob-
v ous object i t rendering what pased unintelligible to
the g, tour of the Tolbootr, wh > appeared to be an
Irishman In this scene Miss Nellie Greenlees was
effective, less on account of her Scotch than because of
her appearance. She is verypre.ty MissJnno was
effective, too; but the other actors are rather heavily
handicapped iu the scenes iu which she appears, as it
takes them such a deuce of a time to waltt round her
It must, however, have been gratifying toJeanies
lelations to perceive that even the agony of extreme
grief could not affect her physically.
• * «-
The trial scene reminded us of those days
before we had been taken to Jefferis* bosom and
visittd the judge and jury et the cider cellars The
judge, in particular, was excessively droll He was a
low comedy judge, and was rigged out in a robe made
of redparlour-curtain and a cat-skin wig. The counsel
for the prisoner asked all hia questions of the wit-
nesses with his arms upon the witness-box; Effie
appeared in the dock with her hair down ; her
poor circumstances po - - sibly rendering the provision of
a pocket-handkerchief impossible. The court itself
didn't quite resemble a dead-heuse so much as a wine-
cellar, and we commend heartily the five jurymen
present for their efforts in making themselves looa as
much like twelve as possible. Their skill in spreading
themselves out was surprising.
• • •
The acting was, what Mr. Weller would call
“ unekal" Mr. b'eftnn was good as the outlaw Geordie
Bobertson, and Mr E. B. Russell was effective, but too
broad There was an attenuated young man in boots
who seemed to be ubiquitous. This, we believe, but
are not sure, was Frana Levitt (Mr J. W. Wheeler).
This shadow flitted about so continuously, that in the
end his speeches were received derisively; and it is
only a wonder that the popular indignation did not, as
in the case of Mr Wopsle, “take the form of nuts."
Juno s Jeannie was a highly “substantial" perform-
ance, and some pathos was embodied in it. But we fail
to see what particular point Eloise makes iu dressing
the part as if she was just going out charring Miss
•heenlees made a charming Effie; her acting being
Effie-oient all through. The rest were feeble.
* * * *
The Sheridan drama season at the Gaiety pro-
mises to be productive of something more than tame
to Mr. Sheridan and something just less than immor-
tality to Mr. Frank Towers. The fact, is, that Mr.
Sheridan is already a favourite with the playgoing pub
ho of this city. We say already, advisedly. It is a i
surprise to see a man who has genuine histrionic ability
succeeding here in so short a time. What we most
appreciated, as a rule, is upholstery. Give us a leg
*ith frills and upholstery and we are happy. Parti-
coloured pageantry and carnivalesque ooatumery are
what our cult ured taste re vela in, They make no
strain upon tha intellect. However, this is an excep-
tion to tne rule.
• • •
The season opened with “ The Corsican
Brothers." This play has a peculiar charm for us. It
revives the tender memories of tho past. The illustri-
ous pait saw ns a revised member of an amateur dra-
osatic company which used to give performances to an
audience of enthusiastic relatives who used to come to
the lumber-room, which, by an understood etiquet'e
among ns, was always gravely alluded to as “the
"beayter,'* in full dress, and frequently with a pie in
o*e harm and a baby in the other. Wo well remember
Sitting on a log in the forest of Fontainebleau —paintod
oy a boy who was supposed to have mastered all tha
carets of art in running errands for a sign-painter—
“d retiring giaoeiully after the audience hud given ue
two or three hints with ginger-heer bottles. We thought
very meanly of the stage as a profession just then.
But we always considered that we would have revelu-
tionized the drama if we had got a chance. And very
likely we would. Bat we didn’t get a chance. We got
a raw egg mostly.
• # •
Mr. Sheridan doubles the parts of the twin
brothers very cleverly. His acting is excellent from
beginning to end He is herein different from eeveral
other actors whom we know, who would be vary popular
if they would end at the beginning. He is always 1m.
preesive, and never throws away a situation. W«
admit candidly, however, that we prefer to see him in
Shakspearian plays. He is above all things a man who
requires scope
• • •
Mias Davenport—bo still, 0 beating heart —has
not mnoh of an opportunity as Emilia de Lesparre.
But "he does well with it. She takes pains to please,
partly because she likes to. wo suppose, and partly be-
cause she loves her art. We wish we wore art.
• • •
Mr Frank Cates is a little more than his nsnal
self as Chateau Bemmd. There is this difference. He
looks like Chateau Benaud playing Oates. He makes
up very handsomely for the part, hut he lacks the
cynical nonchalance which is thedistlngn’sbing quality
of the character. For all that, however, he is not
ineffective.
• • •
Mr. L. St. Lawrence (Le Baron de Montgiron)
ia very bright, very clever, very John Jeremiah Lamb.
We are beginning to fear that he will never be any-
thing else. It would be to his disadvantage if he could
altogether forget having ever played such a part.
• # •
The Baron Giordano Martelli (Mr. A. L. Bur-
ton) has one point to make and he makes it. When
Louis dei Franchi remarks to Montgiron that he has
changed his mind and will come to enpper after all, the
Biron curled up with surprise, gasps out “indeed.”
This is a fine piece of acting.
* • *
Mr, Arthur Vivian, as Boisgeo, is very good,
although his assumption of senility does not deceive
the gallery. But Arthur plays quite nicely So does
Mr. Joseph Bayner asthe Judge We don't, however,
see why the “ Heads of two Corsican houses" should
be shock-heads But perhaps it is Corsican prejudice.
One of th»m looked like a mad costermonger, and the
other as if he had gone broke in the pie business early
in life, and only came to the surface occasionally to
blink at the sun. The ladies of course were all beauti-
ful as houtis. We can always say this of them when
we can't say anything else. Miss Harriet Tulloch made
a very pretty Marie. Mrs. Melville was stately enough
as Madame Lavilia dei Franchi, and the demoisel'es of
the ballet were too attractive for any virtuous man to
look at.
* * *
The duel scene ia very fine. It is one of the
best pieces of sword-play we have ever seen upon an
Australian stage. Mr. Sheridan, by the way, showed
ns the weapons which ate used. They are genuine
French duelling swords, wi‘h a clean curve and falanoe
that would make the heart of a fencing-master glad.
We were not glad, though, because ia t. bowing us a
lunge over guard, or carte under tierce, or something
with an equally frightful name, he nearly ran us
through. These swords used to belong to Feohter,
now in Hades, and were purchased, at the sale of his
effect?, by Mr. Sheridan.

“ The Corsican Brothers ” will draw good
houses for some time, we think. Equally popular
dramas are to follow.

“ Le Eoi 8’amu»e,” by Victor Hugo, was played
the llrst time in Pane, on the 22rd November. 1832.
Fifty years passed. On the 22nd November, 1882, it
was played the second tiu e. it was prohibited on its
tiret appearance, as seditious. Extreme excitement
reigned when it was produced again, and seats fetched
fabulous prices, two stalls selling at the last moment
for £621 Bat some were given away; that is, everyone
who had witnessed the play in 1832 was invited to see it
in 1882. One actor played in both performances. The
theatre was orammed with celebrities, and the piece

Miss Ada Campbell, of Melbourne, lectured at
the Academy of Music on Sundayl night. Mist
Campbell said she had been a tranoe speaker in privat*
for four years, but Sunday's was her first public lec
ture. It was ambitiously entitled, “ The March of the
Gods—the god Idea of past, present, and future,” was
heavily worded, and delivered in o manner somewhat
stagey. It an exposition of anything particu-
larly new, some of it was not particularly true, and It
was too long. Miss Campbell has a fine appearance,
blackest of hair and eyee, tall, graceful form, and was
well dressed Mr. E. Groville appealed on her behalf
for a considerate hearing, as it was the lady’s first public
speech, and she received it.

scribed in England, The Hon. W. Campbell ought to
be right for a harp anyhow, and a front stool in the
heavenly orchestra on the strength of such a subsorip.
tion. But Mr. Ormond will sit in front of him and play
on a silver-mounted barrel organ, because Mr. O. has
given bigger sums of money than this to the ohnroh.
This will be gall to the Hon. W. The subscribers in
England of course believe that the people for whose
spiritual comfort they are subscribing are the worst
kind of savages. The people of Riverina themselves
prefer spending money in dams to buying bletsings. It
is easy to guess what will become of them.
At a recent meeting of evangelical ministers,
the diecuision turned upon the literal interpretation of
the Scriptures. One of the assembled divines had been
ranking an impassioned appeal for taking the word oi
God exactly as it was written, without adding thereto
or taking therefrom. Said he: “ When God said
‘ streets of gold,' He meant streets of gold; when He
said • gates of pearl,' He meant gates of pearl 5 and
when Ho said ‘ sea of glass,* Ha meant sea of glass-* “
etc When he had made an end of his harangue, a
thin- piping-voiced member from the rural districts got
the floor. He said he was fully in accord with the sen-
timents of the eloquent brother who had just proceeded
him He, too was in favor of taking the Scriptures
literally, and believed God meant just what He said
every time. Of course, he said,there were somethings
that rather puzzled him, as, for instance, where it
speaks o-f the woman who 'was seated on seven hills
He could not understand how she could ever do it, but
he was willing to suppose that she was endowed with
extra large seating capacity.

domed for describing the Ballarat people as “heathen "
to the British public; for there was a time when C. E

“ Men of Ballarat and savages of Bungaree." In a
lata address, Henry Ward Beecher said: —"The God
depleted in orthodox creeds was an Infernal demon,
worse than any imagined by Dante, and every honest
man was called upon to say that be would not worship
such a God even if he were damned for it." Announce-

cleared off with Mr, T. to Dublin. Even then Sir
Francis emplored her to return, if only for the sake of
her children; but she said no ; and, like the Melbourne

him to send her her petticoats and stockings. Sir

Arabi. — Ahmed Ababx, the Egyptian, as ho
proudly style* himself—has written to Loudon Van it*
Fair, which, like Ike Bulletin, has throughout xtoug-
nised the logical fairness,of the Egyptian national move-
ment headed by him and most unhappily crushed by
the Gladstone Cabinet. He gives a condensed ac-
count of his career, and commences thusThis i*

village of Herriet Eazna, the Eat tern by birth, tho
Egyptian by nationality, the Moslem of the Shafri
sect by religion, and the descendant ofHoassein ''

Fatmth el Yahrah, a “ daughter of Mahomed, tho Pro.
phet of God." Ho was born in 1811, and alter a vihugo
education, he, following a strong natural inclination,
entered the army in 1855. By Baid Pasha he was pro-
moted and trusted, reaching a higher military rank Uiau
any Egyptian before him, as Kaimakam Bey. Arabi
speaks affectionately of Said Pasha, who, he says,often
expressed to him that ho would like nothing better tnau
to see Egypt governed by natives, like other civiiuod
countries. Said also, according to Arabi, "tried ail
efforts to educate the Egyptians, and to promote them
acceding to their merits, but death met him too scon."
When Ismail Pasha succeeded fcaid as Khedive, Egypt
owed only live millions. "But Ismail introduced his
extravagance and general maladministration, and treated
the inhabitants with injustice, and so continued till ho
was dethroned, alter having involved the country in debt
for a sum of *' one hundred thousand millions of pounds ”
(obviously a misprint for “one hundred million* of
pounds,’’) owing to Europeans, and seventeen a l ions
of pounds owing to the inhabitants. Arabi was iq" illy
beloved by the Egyptians, the officers, and the tOK.ere,
as he was hated by Circassians, Turks, and Grce.tr, be-
cause they found he abhorred injustice. Bo they ibhu
Circassians) got him out of service during th. \ urm
years at tho commencement of Israeli Pasha's rc.g •, m
order that they might have their own way in the .a ooy.
In 1867, Arabi entered the Civil Service, as inspect r m
the office of Public Works, and re entered the a, my iu
1871. When Ismail was dethroned and Tewflk succeeded
him, in 1880, Arabi was promoted to t® Lieutenant Colo-
nel. Many other Egyptians were simultaneously ;.r. mo-
led. These changes occasioned intrigues by Circus lau*
and others against Egyptians, and plots were laid to expel
every Egyptian from his poet, a design forth., rad by
the then Minister for War, Osman Pasha Kifki, who
was himself a Circassian. These injuries were nioru
than the native Egyptians, especially the officers of tho
army, oould endure, so they ad came to ths house of

classes should be established, and that the War Minis-
ter should be au Egyptian according to the ju t laws
which prevail In all civilised countries." This just re-
quest was found seditious and unreasonable. A ■ lonuoil

expoUed from our posts and imprisoned on th 1st of
February, 1881. The soldiers tnea rose iu a be iy. onu
got us out of prison ou thu tamo day. Then th j Minis-
ter of War was changed, Mahmoud Pasha B mi, au
Egyptian, being appointed, and orders were given to
those who had been dismissed to resume tht.i posts,
while at the tamo time new and just law lor tho
Army were proclaimed, promising equality for all; but
the orders were not tollowed out, and everything was
done as heretofore. Thus the local Govor or» weiu
still robbing the peasants of their property at u tbaorb-
ing all their gain." Arab! then thought that the time
had come to save the country from the yoke of slavery,
and ou the 9th of September, 1881, he asked thu Khudlvu
to change the Ministry, "because it was nnab.o to brini;
about any reforms in the country, and ask d for a
Council of Notables, to give every man his r gntti, and
propagate new laws, so that no one should violate time..
This request was made in the presence of all the soldiers
in Calm In front of Abdeeu Palace, and in the piesuuou
of more than two thousand Notables and Bheiks also.
These demands were communicated to the Khedive by
Mr. Cookson, U.B.M.'s Consul at Alexandria Thu
Khedive approved of Arabi's demands, and all thu
soldiers left greatly pleased, asking for His Highness
to live lor ever. Then the Egyptian nation tuougho
that tho» were going to have what they asked lor
through Arabi, who put himself in danger for tho Baku
of his country " Arabi was afterwards promoted to b j
Minister of War in December, 1881; ana when tu.i
Ministry of Cherif Pasha fell, owing to a disagreement
between the Ministers and thu Council of Notables.
Arabi became Minister of the Navy as well on the Had
February, 1882 Then he was promoted to be a Pash»
(General), which honour he did not accept, “knowing n.
I® be only a temporary one, as he sought the
perpetual title of one who loved his country
that would carry his nsCmo down to posterity."
Arabi never gave up working for the reform of the
oountry, and lor spreading liberty amongst the nation.
He formed the Council of Notables and established new
laws for the Army, and began to reform the state of thu
Courts of Justice, thus lotting them follow rules bind-
ing on the Judges and the judged. " When Arabi’s in-
tention became known to his enemies, and the progress
of the Egyptians was also clear to them, they began to
play tricks on tho Khedive, and instructed him to tell
the Consuls that their lives and the lives of all thu
Europeans were in danger. The Khedive did so, and
that was the cause of the evil that befel Egypt. Thu
men-ot-war came to the harbour of Alexandria; ill-
feeling broke out between the Europeans and Egyptians,
and tuo massacre of the 11th of June took place iu
Alexandria. The war alsa commenced between tho
English and the Egyptians by the order of the Khedive,
and it ended by the imprisoning of all the Egy pi lau
men of ability—military, civil, Ulemas, merchants.

A RARA AVIS.
Rejoice, for we have found at last,
A man who not a knave is I
Rejoice, he is a parson, and
a real ram avis 1
He lived at Port Maokay—a place
As hot as it’s unholy—
And there he gave himself up to
The saving of souls solely.
We don’t know what success he had
In “roping in" the sinning;
Not much, p'raps, for most souls up there
Are damned from the beginning.
Bat, this we know, that he did good.
Taught his own congregation
God’s word— and did not once consign
Bis rivals to damnation 1
And, more wo know, that when he left
His parish full of ninnies.
He took no testimonial, and
Refused a puree of guineas !
That's why we pay that we have found
A real mm avia—
One servant of the Lord who’s not
A clerical John Davies.
We sinners say this man is true
And faithful to his charges;
Wo leave the saints to think that be
A lunatic at large is,
Fuss— and Finance.

PEPPER AND SALT.
A queer census was taken lately in an English
town. In this town there are 25 church33 and 35 public
bouses. On a Sunday in November last the local Tem-
perance Society counted the paople who weut to wor-
ship God, and the number that want to pay their devoirs
to the devil. The devil haadel tha poll with 5691 to
5570. And only two hours' traffic was count-ad! The
moral of this seams to ba that people shiuld be allowed
to take their bottle of bear with then to ohuroh. It
would be an excellent aitidote agiinst dry sermons,
anyhow. But it is a fearful thing to think that there
should be people living whi love liquor mere than the
Lord. A very fearful thing. If we could withdraw
any ef our capital out of tha m ssionry busiaess, we
should go right home and buy up five hotelo at fire
good cash-corners in that town.
The ghost of Myles Joyce, who was hanged for
the Maamtrasna murders, is said to hang around the
scaffold every night. Wo should call this gluttony.
What might take a good deal of the supernatural awa
out of the thing is the fact that the ghost invariably
smells of whisky. But then it is whisky hot. This is
consistent, and probable. Wo should like to see
Myles’s ghost. Wo have one or two massages which
we want to send to some of our departed frieadi, and
the mail there is too irregular. On second thoughts,
however, we think we shall defer sanding them till the
next C.M G. dies.

—Mr. Redmond at tha Yicfcorieral.

And say, quite pat,
That you were skulking, while he apoko

It seems that the grave of old Hobson, who was
Governor of New Zealand shortly after tha dolnge, has
not been kept in that state of repair which was due to
the dignity of the bone-dust down below. This same
Hobson, by the way, has rich dsaoandants who are
living in England, and drawing the rents of the pro-
perty hs left them. They don’t seem to ba much con-
corned ab ut the condition of the old man’s tumulus.
But a number of sentimental patriots have been
writing harrowing letters to the 1 >cal papers about
it Toe only one concerned who koeps absolute silence
in the matter is the old man himself. And we, though
we mention the affair, agree with him absolutely. Wo
can see some reason for raising a manual sat to a dead
great man who has done great dteds, because, in such a
ease, the monument is raised to an idva; but we can see
no reason whatever for piling granite over a heap of
unheroio bones. We should say, if the people of N Z
want to appropriately and usefully commemorate this
deputed old Governor, they should exhume his bone 3
and make dice ©at of thim. Tiesj might ba placed in

VICTORIAN EDUCATION.
The Victorian State Schools seam to be lively
spots. Here’s an Aeods par. on the Education Com-
mission, metrically paraphrased:—
According to one lady—(she was just a slight bit ner-
vous, tire),
Who'd been for two decades (at least she said so) in the
service, sirs,
The masters very often, dipped their beaks in "Red
FalerniaE.’’
And girls davoured poetry of a nature most “ Swin-
burnian."
She'd seen a master Euclid teach—in truth, in no great
haste ho was—
For he was putting his big arm around the pupil’s
waist, ho was.
The girls are “ bold and turbulent," like ballat girls or
aotressc -,
And meet the boys cn starry nights, and also at choir
practices ; —
The pupil teachers, oh, they are so awfully ver-
tiginous*
(Puzzled for a rhyme).
Like hawks, they’re always trespassing around the poor
doves’ pigoon-’ous.

The Salvation Army don’t seem to be making a
splash. Beyond affording entertainment to the you‘h
of Kent and Sussex ‘streets, they may be said to bo
generally " out of it." Mrs. Sutherland’s principal
duties seem to be to haunt the unfortunate working
man in his hours of leisure, and entreat him, while ho
worries his oorned beef, to accept the Terewth. Some-
times he accepts it just to pacify her; —but generally
not. Mrs. S. indeed, is a kind of plebeiifn Mrs. Par-
diggle. That lady, it will be remembered said—“ I am
a School lady, I am a Visiting lady, I am a Reading
lady, I am a Distributing lady, and I am on the Local
Linen-box Committee." These functions necessitated
daily visits from Mrs. P. to the poor, who, it appears,
received that lady wilh much contumely. Who can
ever forget, when the want to the briokmaker’s cottage
to read the Bible to the assembled family, the manner
of her reception by the owner of the hovel. Anticipat
ingher usual questions immediately on her entrance!
he says “ 1 1 my daughter a washia’ ? Yes, she is a
washin’. Look at the water. Smell it. That’s wot we
drinks. How do you like it, end what do you think of
gin instead ? . . . Have I read the little book wot
you left ? No, I didn't read the little book wot yt u
left. There ain’t nobody here as knows how to
read it j and if there was, it wouldn’t be suitable
to me. It’s a book for a babby, and I’m not
a babby. If you was to leavo me a doll, I shouldn’t
nuss it. . . . Don’t, I never mean to go to church ?
No, I don’t never mean to go to church. I shouldn’t
be expected there if I did. The Beadle’s too gen teel
for mo." Mrs. Sutherland’s ministrations being very
much, as we have hinted in the style of those of Mrs.
Pardifgle, her advent is rooeived with growls and
anathema; bub while she is barely tolerated, the
den;z 3ns of the slums won’t have the men at any price.
The Captsin, himself, is a mere mark for saucepan lids,
while the lieutenant (the “example") is even pelted
with mud by youthful anti-Salvationists in the suburbs
There are now in Sydney the Harmy proper, the Red
Ribbon Army, and the Blue Ribbon Army, and yet the
city doen’t seam to get any more moral. We ore glad,
however, to see the members of all these forces looking
so sleek and well fed. This proves that their doctrines
agree with them, though they don’t seem to be swallowed
by their hearers.
The parishioners of a subarban church com.
plain that their pastor spenls most cf his time in edit-
ing a j aurnal devoted to damning—on paper —every-
body who doesn’t belong to his creed, that is to i>ay,
everybody who doesn’t drop the threepenny.bits into
his plate instead of into that of the man opposite. The
parishioners are unreasonable enough to think that,
while his r.vdrenoa is doing this, he ought to be minis-
tering to tbo r filleted, and comforting the poor and the
helpless Is there any gas out in that suburb? or
trams? or rum? or civilization of any kind? We
thought ws had done with the dark ages, but it seems
wa are mistaken To talk in these times of a pastor
visiting the 1 ick and ministerirg to the afflioted! Tne
thing is btrbarouj. A pastor of the present day is
simply an ecclesiastical lay-figure with a stomach. He
is intended to wear slippers worked by sentimental
piotn old maids, to till a good story after a good dinner,
to live on the best, to damn nearly everything but
principally the expense, and to receive illuminated
addresses and purses of sovereigns when he is going oil
to some fresh feeding-ground. This is what a modern
pastor is expected to be, and to want him to bo any-
thing eLa is tinply to be a darned fool.
Tho Mohnino Rum ia, aa several ’buamen
know, a little paper, imported from Melbourne, and
retailed here, f-,r the present, at one penny per copy.
It is someti nes bsliioaso, occasionally whimpering, in-
variably envious, aud always funny. It is, in fact, a
huge—or, rather, a small—j mnmlistic joke. The more
the Rum trios in its articles to be serious, the more
farcical do those productions turn out. What are
written to be bimb>, turn oat mere halivemes ; what
they consider satires, are tha mast ingenuous hSUses
In a recent article, the Rum professes to have several
correspondents wh > have forwarded communications of
an uncomplimentary nature. One of these, alluding to
the Irish question, says to the editor: “Don’t bo a
d d fool about it 1" a command which is, of course,
more easily attend than obeyed! Another oommuai-
cation, written, wa expect, oa the back of an unsatisfied
summons for a half-sole-aad-healing bill, considers tho
D T. is “edited by the devil;" an opinion which, by
reason of the eccentric manner in which the paper is
written aud “ read," is shared by many Jehus besides
himself. But if (ho Rom cannot turn out literature of
a more distinguished order than a shoe-shop proclama-
tion, itmust at least bo given credit for a noble and coura-
geous spirit. “ Wo shall not," loftily writes the editor,
referring to the facetious communications ho has re-
ceived, “we shall not be deterred by these silly exhibi-
tions from expressing our opinions in the freest and
fullest manner, and, in pursuance of that determination,
we now direct the attention of our readers to tha
following form of tha Fenian oath, as read by Mr.
Whilley in the House of Commons during tha discus-
sion on tha Oaths and Offl 303 Bill." In this oath, the
Rum makes thelpoor Penmans (even they can’t escape I)
swear to "root out every vestige of the adulteration
[I! I] and murders of Henry VIII, . . ." Adultera-
tion, of course, comes natural to the poor “devil" who
wrote this. It surrounds him. He takes kindly to
sand in his sugar, and smilas on the slugs in his salad.
But yet, for the nobleness of his nature, wo feel inclined
to forgive him his little etymological error. He will
not bo “deterred from expressing in the fullest
(and he might add “easiest’') manner his elevated
opinions. For this we think the devil ought to have a
testimonial. Something that would, even years hence,
recall to his racolleotion the estimation in which his
contributions were held by the publio. Hold on till we
get onr new boots.

Father Finnegan, of Gundagai, has had a buggy
and a set of harness preieatel to him. If we mistake
not, ha is the gentlsman who had a fight over a school
or something years ago at Grenfell, or Young, or some-
where. It is said that ho was much surprised at the
gift We have been there before. We remember
fainting with surprise when the public presented us
with a purse to pay tha Clontarf verdict. But we had
watched it growing f ir all that. Hour after hour we
stood on the watch-tower of the Jug seeing the sub-
scriptions coming in. Day after day we rehearsed a
little scene when we were presented with the coin, and
bent our heads gracefully down on our shirt-fronts and
wept tears of gratitude. Yes, we repeat wo have been
thsro before, and we allow no 10 but ourselves to at
press surprise at receiving a testimonial. At the sam#
time we should ourselves rather like to mike a pretea
tation to a clergyman. It is well to be on good term
with the next world. We think our testimonial wouij
take the form cf a tooth-brush.

An Arithmetical Alligator.
It was an alligator, and
A giant one at that,
Wnoee sole ambition was to get
On human ti-asue fat.
All other fish, or flesh, or fowl,
Ha reckoned little worth ;
Ha was the greatest gourmet in
The rivers of the North.
And, even as this same grew scarce.
Did ho grow gaunt and thin.
Until he hardly knew the taste
Of black boy or of gin.
Just then a little bank-clerk passed,
And joined the heav’nly ranks—
The alligator drew on him
Upon the river banks.
And red-Hned ledger, clerk, and all.
He swallowed then and there,
Li&ewitea pass-book, and also
A ready reckoner.
From that time forth he thought so hard.
He had no lime 10 smile;,
Till he developed into a
Most cult mod crocodile.3
He got the tables ell by heart,
Ho knew the rule of throe—
With equate Root be was easy, and
With Enolid he was tree.
His greatest pleasure was to lie
Beside the river ford.
And count the blacks that passed across—
Deducting one tor board.
Until he got so proud of his
Proficiency in i hie.
That he would fast » week if he
The count of one would miss.
But, on a luckless day, there came
A shrewd scribe run to seed.
Who was a-gomg np to run
The Northern Centipede.
The alligator swallowed him—
Great Scott, It was a spree I
The river for five nights and days
Ran rum into the sea.
And ev’ry settler from the ford
Unto ihe river mouth
Got so infernal drunk he did
Not know the North from South.
As for the poor old crocodile,
Ho got tao horrors, to
He thought be was a little hell
Where bulldog ants would go
When they wire dead, and so he kept
His jaws for ever wide.
And tiled to keep a tally of
i'Le ants that went inside.
But, finding ho lost count, he lost
Heart also. Let him slide—
Me stuck his head into the mud
And in the horrors died.

of it I) Association meeting in the
Temperance Hall, it is reported that
“one young man, who had deter-
mined to commit suicide before
meeting with the Bible woman, sent
a letter of gratitude and thanke for

This is from an obituary notice
in an English paper :—” The corpse
was elegantly clad by order of his

he had j us t left.” Passing over with
a smile the statement that the
corpse had a wife, we may freely re-
mark that this is just the kind of
treatment we wish to have when we
are dead. We are not fastidious
about the style of the coffin. An
ordinary cedar shell, lined with
velvet, so that we shall be able to
turn round when we want to without
hurting ourselves, and with the
usual silverfoi! cherub, and a tin
plate with our name, age, and num-
ber of convictions inscribed on it,
will do for us. But with regard to
the inside we are more particular.

greasy baby in one fist and a pro-
gramme and the bottle iu the other.
If Granny will look in at any one of

The editor off +he Mudgeb
Telegraph is evidently net a man
to be trifled with. Of the proprietor
of the Independent he says:—“Last
Sunday the dummy proprietor,

editor) published that be (the said
dummy) was drunk—we did not
know that he was drunk on that
day, neither do we now, we quote
hia own words—cn the above day
he would smash his head. We
would advise him—poor helpless
oreaturel—to leave that kind of
work alone for his own sake; but
tor ours, we invite him te oome and
try hia hand at it, and we will smash
over his back a guinea hunting whip,
whioh we have purchased for the
attack, should that pusillanimous
biped dare venture to make it.”

Mr. A. Q. Taylor, was in Sydney.

Life is not all rum and dog-fighting in the far
North. A Queensland paper, which we have just tent
to keep company with toe Howl in our dust-Iin, has a
paragraph about as long ts Ivo Bligh’s foot regarding a
raid that was made upon the township by certain
brecobless original owners of the soil, in which they
sprartd and carried off two cows, crawled with felonious
designs through a house towards the kitchen, and
cleared all the clothes-lines in the town. 1 his is
dreadful Bat when several blsckfdlows were shot in
sport by acme dashing young blades, the fact was cur-
sorily mentioned as an affair of small importance in
two or three lines. There is evidently personal preju-
dice about this. The editor resented the spearing of
the cows as a family insult, but dealt lightly with the
■hooting of the blacks because he was rather glad tl an
torry to behold the gradual < xtinction of the house of
his rival over the road. The bitterness about the
clothes-lines we oan undersiai d The e liter lost his

he forgot to add that the blacks came back next day
and mads him a present of two of the patron’s shirts.

so that ho might ea r u money to buy boots." He did
not go to the Bum office—be had been there. The foot-
less man he met was an Evknino News man who had

While King Henry V. was rolling his eyeballs

Squatters don’t always have it their own way

the lessee was only tco glad to sellout to the smart
selector for a nominal sum. This is good, but here is
t «tter:—A r quatter up North employed a freo-seleoting

sitting a good while, the hungry Tolmer took huff and
left. Having a shrewd suspicion that directly he
vanished they would start foiling oaks for their bul-
locks. he reckoned on getting even by catching them at
it. Going only a little way, he dismounted and sneaked
off to reconnoitre But they watched him, too, and as
soon as he was out of sight «f the horse, one of them
slipped the bridle off, and, tying a priokly bush to his

and refused all religions ministrations. Ho absolutely
revelled in the idea of death. The day before he was
bangtd he ate enormously, he made merry with every-
body that came near him j he danced alo.- g the verandah
when at exercise near the condemned cell, so far as his
irons would permit him; and throughout the night he
sang all his camp-faro songs, cursed and swore, went
through his western orgies one by one, and fought his
fights over again, making use of awful language, but
most awful at such a time. The hardest-hearted man
in the gaolatood aghast. He could not be stopped ; it
wae his last night on earth and he intended to put it in
as he chose. Ten minutes before he was executed he
asked for a steak. Half an hour afterwards the remains
of James Blsdale—the Eingtailed Roarer, were in a
shell on their way to the cemetery." Which shows
that there Is nothing which enables a man to die
happily so much as a clear conscience—except the
having no conscience at all.
A lot of funny people have signed a requisition
to the Mayor, 11 to convene a public meeting for the
purpose of protesting against the mission of the
Messrs. Eedmond Brothers, who have visited the
colony on behalf of the Irish National Lsaaue ” The
list of requisitionists is a yell by itself. Amongst a
number of unknowns who, though they are not “ uiter,"
are utterly, we perceive that of Henry Hicks, who
used to sell cheese, but who is now chief of the Orange-
men ; William Kippax, who does sell fowls, and who is
also great in Orangeism; the Only Itey (who has
probably gone in for a joke); Sammy Lees, the disin-
terested vessel who carries a sword round on Orange
Celebration Day, and does the printing for the Coffee
Palace ; and old Lutton, who prints tracts, and so on
To those who understand these things, this requisition
is a great lark; and we expect that Mr Harris has b*d
his tongue in his cheek ever since he received it. We
shall certainly go and see the fun ; the more especially
because we see by the list the requisitionists contem-
plate "having a Toose out.
There have been fine doings on the South coast,
when the senior-sergeant of police has been “ had up,"
for in vulgar terms, “ shaking" a shovel. The case was
dismissed, of course, but some cf tire evidence was very
instructive. One policeman said that when he and the
sergeant came across the shovel, the latter said—we
quote the local paper ;— •* That’s that Ferrigal
Hdghbrty’s, the fellow that gave evidence against you
it will serve him right to give him a touch lor it. . . -
I never spoke to Hegherty at all about the shovel; I
was afraid to do bo, from what I have seen the (senior-
sergeant do; I would not believe the sergeant on his
oath; I have been of that opinion since I have known
him, about eleven months ; I believe I can be believed
on oath." And another peeler (Ball) referring to his
superior officer, said . . . “ The reason I was afraid
was that from what I know and have heard of the ser-
geant I believe him capab e of saying or swearing any-
thing ; d-d not report it to any of my superior officers
because I wai a'raid ” W«, of course, can't believe the
sergeant “ shook” the shovel We have known police-
men to take many things at many times, but we never
knevof one descending so low as a shovel This is
evidently a libel ou the worthy sergeant, and, doubt-
less, Mr. Posbary will see that he is only oomp msated.

“ I dined,” says Lady Bloomfield in her
“ Reminiscences,” “ at Montagu House, and had the
pl-asuro of meeting the Bishop of Oxford (Samuel
Wilberforco ) I was told a funny story about him—
viz., that when he was dining with a large party, a
poor curate who was deploring i he large family he had
to educate with a small income, said: ‘ Do you know,
my lord, I have nineteen children?' Upon which a
very red-faced woman with a squeaky voice exclaimed:
• Only fourteen by me, Mr. Jones!’"
Here’s a line that has come out about the Queen
in the authoritative Memoirs of Sir Archibald Allison.
Her Majesty evinced great interest in the Scottish
battles, and, on being informed that both armies at
Bannockburn were commanded by her ancestors, she
remarked: “I am more proud of my Scottish descent
than of any other.” The conversation turning on Queen
Mary and Elizabeth, Her Majesty remarked: “I am
thankful I am descended from Mary. I have nothing to
do with Elizabeth."
The moat experienced woman of the age lives
over in Auckland, N,Z. Some years ago her husband
obtained a divorce from her. She immediately married
another man. They lived together four years and then
he packed up his swag and loft Whereupon she be-
came engaged to a third man. The first husband met
this daring individual and scared him off by a history
of her liendishness He also slid. But she was too
smart for him. He was caught and had to pay £300
damages for breach of promise. And then the first
husband stepped in and married her again. This is
what we call enterprise.
This is how M. Tarnier, a French scientist,
undertakes to pull down the high average of mortality
among newly born infants :—He has const ruoted a box,
modelled precisely after that used as a poultry incubator,
which is divided into two compartments, a first or
lower one as a reservoir for hot water, and an upper
one in which the infant is placed, and which is des-
cribed as well stuffed at tbe sides and fitted with a
sliding glass cover. Through the influence of the hot
water, the temperature is kept at eighty-six degrees
Fahrenheit M. Tarnier has proved that by keeping
infants in this incubating box from two to six weeks,
seventy five per cent, have been saved that would have,
otherwise, died. The experiments have actually bsen
conducted, and out of ill sickly and premature infants,
only two tters lost.
He did it once, but he won’t do it again. fi 0 .
slating an insinuation that he " wasn't game,” a gentle,
man last week went into a department not usually
invaded by men in a certain large house in town. On a
row of wooden legSi was a wondrous display of beauteous
hose that appeared to dance before his dazzled vision
like a phantom ballet. A score of bright-eyed oustomeig
seemed to stare through him, and he felt like a planet
processing through apace, when he heard the young
iady’s voice say, “ Do you wish anything P” He partly
recovered himself, and pointing to a pair of light bines,
stammered out, "W—what are the«e—these for?”
“ To wear," was the placid reply. “ Ah, bnt I mean,
when are they worn P ! ’ ‘‘Well, they’re not w- rn i n
bed, as a rale,” ehe said maliciously. “ Are they for
the street, or—or parties, and things P” he ventured.
“ Yes,” she said in a steely tone. She looked deiiantly
at him, tapped the buttons of her dress with a pencil,
and wore a general “ be-caretol sir” air, that oppressed
him and made him feel hot Hla eyes wandered np a
symmetrical calf covered in flesh pink silk that ran in
under an elastic garter and then abruptly ceased The
restless pencil went tap tapping on her button at about
eleven hundred to the minute. “ I want to buy a pair
of stockings," he said. “ Wha 1 - size ?” He grew faint
again, hut pulling himself together, ventured, “Oh,
number twelve.” “ We don’t keep that size," said the
young lady tartly. “ Well, I meant number three " “ I
guess yon want baby's socks,” ehe said audaciously.
•* You can be waited on at the next counter.” Then he

LANGTRY v. LABOUCHEEE.
Lily had a William goat.
Whose Christian name was Fred;
His strong point was his bank account
His weak point was his head
Thi» goat he followed Lily round
Wherever Lily went,
And bank-notes by the hundred for
Champagne and flowers he spent.
Then Henrietta, Lily’s friend.
In quite a passion flew.
Because the goat forgot to give
Her wine and flowers too.
But Lily only smole a smilo.
Half scornful, half sublime,
And said her goatie did not oara
For nannies past their prime.
" A yawning gulf divides us hence I”
Her friend, enraged, replied;
“ Well, let it yawn," the Lily said—
“ It cannot yawn too wide."
Then Henrietta went aboard
A transatlantic boat.
And, in high dudgeon, sailed away
From Lily and her goat.
A male stranger is never by any ohanoe allowed
into an Egyptian harem. Indeed, even to mention the
sultana, by hoping she is well, is a deadly oilenoe in a
visitor, though it is notorious that the Sultan goes
through a fresh wedding every Friday morning, and
that every now and then, when his seraglio gets trouble,
scmely full, he distributes his surplus wives among his
officers. But, though less notorious, yet not less true
is it, that, of late years, scarcely a harem of importance
in the East is without European girls in it. It is the
keeper’s highest ambition to have one or several hand-
some European—often English—girls in his possession.
Every year many girls are miesed from London, Paris,
and other towns, and it is never published what be-
comes of them. There are stories of their being
decoyed to Belgium ; but every day in the streets of
London, snaky-eyed Orientals oau be seen peering into
the faces of millinery girls and nursemaids who give
promiae of beauty. Passengers by P. and O. boats to
Alexandria have noticed bevies of rosy-cheeked damsels
being escorted eastward, without ever suspecting why.
These girls are tempted by the idea of a life of petted
ease and indolence They are dazzled by a show of
jewels and tine clothes, and allured by stories of the
gorgeous Eastern palaces; only to find too late that
they have entered a squalid prison, amid women as
heathen as any the world can show, and with whom
it is impossible to exchange a word to while away the
loneliness of a life which has lost its novelty. So long
as they keep the favour of their lord they are objects of
persecution and plots; when they lose it their lot is
unhappy beyond conception. Snob stray lambs are
seldom sought after, though to their relatives they are
as much lost as if they had plunged into the sea. The
harem rarely surrenders its prisoners, and, if it did,
they are too ashamed to return, poor and disillusioned.

it while jon are young. Your loving father." They
were botanising “ I wish I were a tern !'* he suddenly
exclaimed •* Why ?'* ehe aeked. “ Why—perhaps—
you—would press me, too " She evidently hated to do
it, but it is best to nip snob things in the bud ; so she
replied: “I’m afraid you’re too green, Charlie.” “I
wish you were a comet 1" “ And why ?" he asked, with
a look of tenderness that would have brought a seraphic
smile on Jack M'Elhone’s features “ Oh," ehe said,
with a brooding earuestnees that fell upon his soul like
a I arefoot upon a cold oil-oloth, “ because then you
would come round only once in 1500 years." One

white, rounded throat, and the shoulders',' in mould and
in colonring, would put to shame the most artistic form
over sculptured in marble" In Kentucky, two
sprightly young girls carry on branch agencies for an
Insurance Company. Business has increased very
much at those branches. Young men like to be asked
if they’re quite sound London youths now have
their minds pretty well relieved from perplexity as to

made up all ready in glass-topped boxes, containing
anything almost, from handkerchiefs, gloves, fans, bows,
even to silk stockings, and garters with jewelled clasps
A girl in Vienna went to a doctor to consult him

W« have an excellent illustration of the practice of
Ireland the shuttlecock of English parries, in

A great deal of interest attaches to the problem
u to now Zimmler, the celebrated ax-J P , of Uni gong,
will vote at the Mudgee election, the candidates being
Taylor, M’Elhome, and Boneo. Taylor said it served
Zimmler right, being removed from the bench {
M’Elhone slated him as "an ignorsnt and incompetent
man •" and Zimroler's apologists allege that the peti-
tion on which bo was removed was instigated by Rouse
We wouldn’t oare to be in a Zimmler dilemma.
Sir ’Enry said, at Tenterfleld, that ho was
"honourably defeated’’—he repeated it— ’• honourably
defeated," at East Sydney. Aid, in the next breath,
the ex Dictator stated that, bad be been elected as a
colleague of Mr. M'Elhone, he would net have taken his
■eat for Eoet Sydney. Thia is true Farkesian logic.
And it is Farkesmn gospel, also. There’s not a scintilla
of truth in it. No one who saw the painfully dejected
look of Sir ’Enry on East Sydney hustings when the
fatal news was known, could believe such a statement
Had he been elected by one vote (with M'Elhone at the
top of the poll) Sir ’Enry would have gloried in his
triumph, snd taken bis teat with thankfulness. Tot we
suppose Wearhat and his confederate chaw bacons will
gulp down and smack their lips over the romances of
the Great Dead Man.
The statement that Sultan Pasha received
£10,COO for delivering the Egyptian army at Tel el-Kebir
into the bands of Sir Garnet Woleeley, by causing the
outlying pickets to be withdrawn on the night prece-
ding the attack has created a great sensation in England.
Tbe Government organa explain, that, although Sultan
Pacha received £10,000, it was not as the price of his
treachery, but as compensation for destruction of his
property, presumably at Alexandria But the journal
which gave publicity to the transaction retorts that any
number of persona had their property destroyed, and
have received not a farthing of compensation. They
have to wait for the reporter a Commission investi-
gating the different claims Sultan Pasha was paid at
once without waiting for anything. The matter appears
really too transparent to require explanation. Sultan
Pasha was in high command at Tel el-Kebir. Hero
ceived £10 000 oompensat'on for property destroyed.
All his comrades were tried for their lives as rebels to
the Khedive, and their property bae been confiscated.
If Sultan Pasha did not play traitor to his eide, why is
so extraordinary an exception made in his favour?
Mr. Albert Elkin g ton, who very nearly lout
bis brown sugar in East Sydney election, gives as a
raison for interfering with tbe Redmond lecture his
deference to the loyalty of the Masonic body—whatever
that may mean Well, Redmond is a Mason. So is
Parnell. So is Harrington, tbe secretary of the Land
League. So is Biggar. The foot is that Albert Elking-
ten Pickles wants to become notorious. He has grown
too great for the rostrum of the auction mart, and bids
for a high sea* in the Senate. It wouldn’t matter if the
said Albert E'kington Piokles understood tbe great
agrarian question. It is, in itself, no more Irish or dis-
loyal than the cause of the Scotch crofters, or that of
English tenant-farmers—no more than that agrarian
revolution which gave France seven million of small
landlords—no more than the Victorian agitation for the
bursting up of big estates, or than the movement which
is destined at no distant date to convulse this oolonv to
its centres, it the accumulation of acres goes alotg as
it has been going on since Australia became a nation.
Did Albert E'kington F'ckles read tbe statements by
last mail that numbers of English gentlemen had shot
this season upwards of 50C0 or 6000' game on their pre-
serves-while outside tbe boundaries poor English
peasantry perished of cold and starvation. Has be resd
of a certain English "Juke" arranging to plant 600,000
trees annually on hie estate —instead of 60,000 free-born
Englishmen ? It will be well for this Balmain states-
man when he awakes to tbe fact that every man is born
with the eternal birthright of a claim to the soil. D’ye
hear, Albert? It’s not an Irish cry—it’s the giant voice
ef Democracy and Manhood that’s ringing in your ears.
„ The 8.M. Herald rarely deals in direct false-
hood. Perversions of truth by means of sophistical
argument are familiar enough to its readers, but its
grand hold is in suppressions. “ Want of space " is a
flue excuse for omitting any item which would be
inconvenient it published. Take, for example, its re-
port of Mr. Redmond’s speech at the Academy of
Masio, What there is reported is fair to superficial
observation. The fact that the paraphrasing and con-
densation have been so badly done as to kill all the
oratorical, effect of the address may be due to a matter-
of-fact disposition on the part of the reporters. The
report in the Freeman's Journal is pretty much to
the same purpose as the Herald’s, but preserves the
spirit and fire of the orator far bettor. But the sup-
pressions by the Herald are truly significant. What
does the leading journal mean ? Do its conductors
conceive that the people of N 8. Wales are children, to
be told only what they paternally choose to think will
m good for them to know? Want of space) The
Herald never found its spade too cramped to permit
of a whole page report of the maqnderinge of a crew of
senseless ecclesiastics of the Blble-bangiug order.
The exsuse can saaroely be available when for the
first time a representative man presente himself to
plead the cause of a nation In desperate travail,
v, w f nt °* B Psoe be the excuse, surely in the name of
charity any passage of Mr. Redmond’s speech might
have been suppressed in preference to this —tbe voicing
of « real distress; the cry of children and women lack-
mg food. Read it people of New South Wales The
wlsllea mu not to hear it. The Herald ! the
Lhristiaa Herald. The Protestant Herald. The

to meet the coming disaster? Sir—absolutely
none.”
Asd here’s another. Suppressed by the Herald, That
niEALD which has made quite a, feature of Inserting
from every source which tended to dis-
credit the cause of Agrarian reform in Ireland. Here’s
“Oppression, number two. You see, it might excite
J apathy, it was narrated by Mr. Redmond in the
course of his speech r ' *
, "Away in the far west of Ireland, an army
had assembled to carry out some evictions
among a number of poor people who were abac-
lately nnable to pay the accumulation of arrears
oi rack-rent which had been the result of a suc-
cession of bad harvests The people were
thoroughly hopeless and helpless; they would
not if they could, resist. Buta crowd, composed
Jf‘ nci P all T of women and children, collected
house of one of the tenants, and began
‘ w grooxi the pqjjoe and the soldiers. Now, I 1
admit that this was an outrage against law and
order—(loud laughter)—and the police cfiloer
ordered his men to fix bayonets. This not hav-
ing overawed thepeOple, a farther order was
given to charge. Well, at the first right of that
phalanx ot stieel advancing against them, tbe
crowd broke and ran ; bnt tbe faster they ran
the more fiercely charged the policemen. In
the confusion which ensued, a veuve girl stum-
bled and fell. She was about 18 or 19 years old.
She was tbe daughter of one ef the tenants
about to be evicted, and her name was Ellen
M'Donagh. The police eame up to her as she
lay face downwards on the ground. A err of
from the peoplb as they eaw these
ruffians lift their weapons and stab her fiercely
end madly until life was extinct. (Sensation).
Then they oarrUd ker back to her poor home,
where her mother wks waiting for the decree to
make them outcasts As they crossed the
tbre*hold, a yoong man with the fury of a
demon rprang acrots it and attacked the police.
He was knocked down. He was only the bro-
ther cf the poor murdered girl, and soon had
the gyves upon his wrist*. Picture that scene
to yourselves. The poor cabin half filled
with military and police] cn one side the
widowed mother walling ever her murdered
darling ; on the other, her only son about to be
led away as a criminal because be had proved
that he had the h«»rt ef a man within his
breast. (Cheers). Picture that scene to your-
selves, and tell me can yon wonder if that aged
mother lifted her bands to Heaven and curved
the Government which permitted an oh ouortni-
ties. (Tremendous cheering). Picture that
scene to yourselves, you stern moralists who
rail against Irish crime bnt know nothing of Its
provocation 1 Picture that scene to yourselves,
yotl fireside philosophers who would reform
humanity upon a theory, bnt make no allowance
for human nature and human passions—(cheers)
—and iell mo ean you wonder if the people of
that whole country-side—their blood driven to
flame by the sights they bad witneised, deprived
of the advice of their leaders, and stripped of
every hope—were driven to desperation, to
madness, to outrage, and to crime F” (Loud
cheers).
And tbe following comparison of part of tho seme
Knee#), as reported by the Hbbald and tbe pBEEMAN'a
.Touwnal respectively, will serve to show what the
Hbbald regards as fair condensation :—
8. If. Herald,
M He said the land ques-
tion in Ireland might be
said to really date beck to
the first confiscations by
the English. 1 he lands in
Ireland bad been confis-
cated three times, the laat
confiscation being that
carried ont by Cromwell.
The land was parcelled ont
for the benefit of the Bdg-
lish, and the stale of
things thus created was
continued to the present
generation, the result
being that to-day we were
faced by the fact that 740
men owned ooe-half of
Ireland, and 10,000 men
owned the whole of It."
Freemas’s Jotjrbal.
"The land question In
Ireland may be paid really
to date from the first incur-
sion of the English, binoe
then the land of Ireland
has keen confiscated three
times over. The last oon-
flpoation was that carried
ont by Cromwell. The
land of the eeuntry was
then parcelled ont amongst
his successful followers,
and it is an absolute fact
that two-thirds, at least,
of the present owners of
land in Ireland owe their
titles to their estates to
ancestors who earned them
as military marauders.
(Cheers ) By this means
a land system was created
in Ireland, so vicious in
principal and so brutal in
practice, that we look in
vain for its parallel li the
history of the' civilised
world. The native Irish
had, at one blow, been
si rack down from a posi-
tion which was practically
that of proprietor to the
position of serfs. Their
new lords, who, for the
most part had gained
their estates by rapine
and murder, were alien
in race and bitterly hos-
tile in religion. They
sought to retain all politi-
cal and social infl nance in
their hands, and they pos-
sessed absolute power over
the lives and properties of
their nnfortnnate tenants.
('Shame.') As time went
on, things did not improve.
If tenants were rich
enough to reclaim or im-
prove their land, they were
forthwith obliged to pay
over the fnll value of these
improvements in the shape
of rack-rent to their land-
lords. The latter, hating
and hated by the people,
began to live in large num-
bers abroad, merely sand-
ing to Ireland to collect to
the last farthing their ex-
orbitant rates. (Hear,
hear). A natural result
followed. Poverty, misery,
famine, discontent, and
unsuccessful rebellion fol-
lowed each other in dismal
sequence generation after
generation. Then the pro-
cess of consolidation of
estates began to creep in.
and it baa gone on so
steadily ever since that
to-day we have the astound-
ing fact that 740 man own
one half of Ireland, and
a little ever 10,000 men
own the whold of it.

Sir ’Enry at TenterfieldIf you como to me
personally, depend upon it at all times I will receive
you with the utmost courtesy. It will not matter to
me whether the man is in rags, or steps down from a
carriage, be will receive the same attention at my
bands." This is not only fanny, bnt it’s false. Sir
’Enry is the only man in the country who'd have the
Cheek to tell tree men that on public business, he being
a public h an, would receive them with courtesy. How
else should he receive them? But the statement ot
fiir 'Enry is false In office here—and part'ealarly since
his return from Europe—Sir ’Enry has been as arrogant
as a dictator. He has snubbed everybody from whom
he oould expert nothing j and «v<?n towards soma of his
<wn colleagues, his bearing was both vulgar and cffsn.

Dictator I
The Protection and Political Reform Associa-
tion passed a melntion at their meeting on Saturday
S gainst the vote of £150,000 for immigration The
onatman declined to put an adverse amendment,
though the meeting was public. This Protection and
Political Reform Asaoolatuoh is the '‘funniest institu-
tion in the country, sir.'* it’s not only consumptive,
but it’s landless, heartless, gutless i still more, it's
breadless and headless. When it wanted to get a pro-
cession In honour of Graham Berry, it hadn’t money
enough in its coffers to call a furniture van off the
stand } and when it went “ en masse *’ to the railway
station the other day to receive Mlrams, two tram
tickets brenght the whole crowd back to Sy dney. Ob,
and Peter Campbell was at the meeting, denouncing
Tun Bulletin. We areelad ot this, for he praises the
D.T. Peter goes for Paradise, we go for N.8.W,
Anybody can have our share of Paradise. We know it's
precious little.
Sir Henry Parkes, like Mr. Jingle, has the “ gift
of the gab worry gallopin']" but it seems rather oda he
did not, at the time ot the general election, make out as
Kod a ease tor himself as be did at Tenterfield. Per-
pa it was his modesty that prevented him: or the
consciousness that if he spoke out he would lacerate
the teeiisgs of his opponents I Wheroat’s speech was
also very delicious, out when he said —•• tie (Mr.
Whereat) could toil M'KIhone that if he possessed the
grand and noble countenance of tbe man who sat at this
table to-nigbt, instead of the bull-dog expression that
hnng about his own lips, he might well be pleased]"—
he was rather too snggeetive ot the youngest gentleman
at Todgcrs’s when speaking to that good lady cf the
tyrannical Jinkins. We are happy to learn that Mr.
Whereat is never going to ask Parkes for anything, and
that Parked will never request a favour of anybody.
This is good. Those subscriptions somehow didn't look
well. Of course, when a man never reads the papers he
can’t be expected to know that about twenty-live meet-
ings have been held at Aarons', and a furious system of
advertising indulged in, in a vain endeavour to rake in
tbe spons. Hut as soon as he does awaken to the fact
(not necessarily that no money is coming in), he, of
course, declines the testimonial on patriotic grounds.
It wouldn’t look well for a list to close, for instance, as
follows :—Smith, £1X0; Solomon, £100; Jamieson, £5?0;
One Who Knows Him, 5a —too bad. We forget,
almost, what all this is apropos of. Bat we have got a
chatty way of branching off

ment A. G. Taylor, on Monday night spoke for two
hours at Mudgee to over 1000 people. He denounced
M'EIhone as a pretended friend of free selectors, and as
a bully. Ho justified his motion to discontinue oondi-

fended Sir John itobertaon from being concerned in bis

vote of confidence The dailies stated that the *• wife
of Mr. Harrington, secretary of the Land League," bad
been arrested oa suspicion of having participated in the
assassination conspiracy, but bad been discharged.
Tb 4 s was an error. The tjlegram should have read:
“ TVisa, secretary of the Land League," etc The
Bible in btate Schools League has been as badly
whipped as the Catholic party in the Victorian elec-
tions Mr. A. G. Taylor announces that he has com-
menced business as a land agent. We thought Parlia-

from Pfahlert's Hotel. Here the manufacture of every
essential in tbe profession is carried on. At tha rear of
the surgery is a compact little factory where all the

(who.se only address is as above) are always pleased to
show their specimens of artificial tenth to those

Mr. H. H. Playford,- the well-known English
araatetir rowen Vice-President of the London Rowing
Club, died on New Year’s Dav, in the fiftv-third year of
his age With regard to his rowing, the FlEtfl says : —
“He was the most accomplished oarsman and soulier
that we have ever seen. His form was perfeotion, his
pluck indomitable, and his hack-work was a source of
admiration and wonder among all his contemporaries.
As a finished find sculler he had no superior—
nay. more, he has had no equal,- and the poetry of
motion was never more strikingly exemplified than in
his sculling whan at the zenith of his fame.”

On December 28, Joe Coburn and Sullivan had
a set-to at Madison Square Garden, N.Y , U S The
sparring was light, which did not suit the crowd who
bevan shouting. The M C. stepped forward and said
“ You will remember, gentlemen, that this is n friendly
exhibition with the gloves, and that Mr. Sullivan has
kindly come here to spar for Mr. Coburn’s benefit ”
There was a moment's pause, when Sullivan brushed
past the speaker, and cried. “ I came here to box with
Mr. Coburn in a friendly wind-up. This is no ksock-
out business. On some future occasion. I’ll kill a man
for you." This seemed to satisfy the audience, and the
subsequent proceedings were interrupted no more.

American Yachtsmen always remember the motto, ‘ In
time of pea8e yfepAte for war,’ and the promised
coming of these distinguished British visitors leads to
unwoiated activity here Although th« inclement
weather forbids actual yachting, the dry.ldnd work goes
bravely on. Architects, and designers, and bnildefs,
and fitters are all busy. Scores of new yachts are' fa
process of construction, and many owners are making
such alterations and improvements as have been sug-
gested by the season’s experience."

This ifi pretty straight. Jjf . Cortls, the oele-
brated champion amateur bicyclist of HfbglHod, vtho has
just settled down in this colony, wricerf of iffog and
tobacco :— •* I have simply to say of both that they a#e
to bo utterly avoided. * Touch not, taste not, handle
not ’ So much has been written on the evil offsets of
stimulants by leading men of tho profession, they have
all denounced thorn So utterly and completely, that
nothing remains to be said except that practical ex-
perienoe thoroughly endorses their view. Do not take
even a glass of beer at dinner: it does not tjueaoh the
thirst equally with water, and at this period wifi ngt
serve a single good purpose. As to tobaooo, it is a
deadly poison, somewhat similar in its notion to opium,
and quite as powerful. Twenty grains of ordinary
tobacco infused in boiling water, or a single drop of the
essential oil, would in most oases prove fatal.”
A new bioyoling society has just been estab-
lished in Italy, at Milan, under the name of Cerole
VclocU'fHique Milanaia. Tho environs of Milan are
said to contain many skilful riders, and it was from
i Ms part Of the Italian peninsula that M Sari hailed.
M 9 iri will be remembered in England for his perform-
ances at Brighton on a monooyolo of his own invention.
Ho also gave performances in Paris at the Kolias- Her-
gcre, and on one occasion consented to favour a circle
of amateur riders with a sample of his skill. The mret-
ing, strictly private, took place on the premises of a
fashionable bicycle builder, of the Avenue dd la Grande
Armde; and M Sari fairly the spectators by
his surprising feats. Since then, fired by his example,
several Parisian fitters have endeavoured to obtain a
mastery of the monooyole | but only one, I believe, has
succeeded in any marked degree, afld it is said there is
but one English rider who can assert similar elaims.
In Murdoch’s “ Chat about Cricket,” in Long-
man's Magazine, his theory and practice frequently
come into collision in the moat remarkable fashion.
Thus“ Styles of batting when formed are very hard
to alter.” One would scarcely care to nlace much reli-
ance on this assertion, seeing how Murdoch himself
has altered from a brilliant batsman into a “pottering
second-rater." “To practise long at one time is cer-
tainly injmlous." This idea has been faithfully carried
out by the Australians lately, with good results—to the
Englishmen ” Avoid bowling as much as possible; it
brings different muscles into play, and has a bad effect
upon a man’s batting." We feel impelled to add
“ Avoid Shooting also, more especially in long matches.
It deadens the muscles of the shoulders, and destroys
all power to bat.” If Murdoch would give a fow good
rules that he does not break as well as make, colts
might learn something from their perusal.
The celebrated schooner Cambria has been sold
by Sir A. B. Walker to Mr. Parbury. In 1868, the
Cambria won the International Match round the Isle of
Wight, beating the American vneht Sappho, besides tho
pick of English yachts. In 1870 the Sappho returned
with her beam “hipped” out 1ft. 6;n. and 70 tons of load
ballast. In three matches with the Cambria, she
was awarded the prize in each, although the whole series
was a sort of fiasco; still, the superiority of Sappho for
speed and weathsrlinsgs was uudisputable. The same
year the Cambria sailed a match across the Atlantic
against (he American yacht Dauntless, whioh she won
She aLo sailed many matches in America with varying
success the prevailing light winds and smooth water
generally giving tho American yachts tho advantage
Tho Cambria went to tho Mediterranean in 1868 and
1869. In the latter year the Suez Canal was opened,
and tho Cambria was the first sailing vessel whioh passed
through, and the third of any description.
Another mongrel raoa for open boats, 20 feet
and upwards, was sailed on Saturday under the auspices
of tho 8.A.S.C. for a trophy presented by Mr. T. Cadell,
and a second prize given bv the club. The conditions
were that both prizes could not go to one class, and the
crows were limited, 24-feet boats six hands, 22-feet
boats five hands, and under 22 feet four hands. The
course was from moorings in Farm Cove round flagboat
at Manly Baaoh, thence round Shark Island, finishing
between the judge’s flagboat, whioh was moored off
Port Macquarie, and the point The following were the
entries and handicaps, viz Lizzie, 4min; Rosetta,
7min; Minx, lOnain ; Syren. 7miu; Lottie, 2min ;
Haidee, 8nin; Adelphi, scratch; Dreamland, scratch,
'the raee was finished by the Eosetta. at 5h 2lmin 3seo;
Dreamland, 5h 22min SSseo; Adelphi, 5h 26min 42seo;
Lottie, 5h 26min 55sec; Syren, 5b 27min 2i>oo; Lizzie,
5h 28min 2iaeo; th.'' Haidee and Minx bsing about tea
minutes astern of the Lizzie. According to tho terms
of the race, the Eosetta was declared tho winner, the
second prize falling to the Droamland, as the Syren
belongs to the same class as tho Eosetta.
Honour amount American sou’lera is evidently
not considered the correct thing. In a raca between
Lee and Courtney, at Eiohfleld Springs, U.8., the affair
was all settled before the race, it being decided that
Lee was to win, but to make a race of it—Courtney
arranging to lead at some portion of the course. After
rounding the stake, Courtney reminded Lee of tho “ fix-
ing.” and ho was allowed to go ahead. Lee says: “ We
had bean rowing quite easy, and both of ns were quite
as fresh as when we started As soon as I let him go to
tho front, and while I wasn’t thinking of anything, he
rowed right away from me." At the professional
regatta at Saratoga, it was learned that Courtney’s
friends had paid Boss £200 not to beat the Union
Springs sculler. Boss’ friends, hearing of this, offered
him £400 to win, on condition that he placed £200 in
safe hands Ross declined the offer, but assured his
friends he would win, anyhow. In first accepting £200
Boss agreed to a “ cross,” and, in making the state-
ment last referred to, he gave his friends to understand
he would “double-cross" the Courtney crowd. A
double-cross is about the hist recipe we know of for
stirring up muddy water.

and in model is similar to the little Elephant. Five
tons of ballast are fitted inside. Under the cockpit are
the water tank and ice box. The cabin is entered by a
wide com panion way of mahogany. Thera are foar
berths in the cabin and twelve lockers, the doors of
which are of cane, made the same as the seats in old-
fashioned '.hairs. On the starboard side, forward of
the cabin, is the owner’s room, whioh oommnnioates
with a bath and retiring room, and forward of the cabin,
on the port sida, are ihe captain’s quarters. Htaineu
glass doors shut off the forecastle from the cabin, and
also the owner's room from his bath-room. Mirrors are
in place over tbe centreboud trunk. The cabin is
finished in oak, with mahogany trimmings. The sky-
light is of mahogany, as are all other dock trimmings.
The Sasqua’s mast above dsok is 38 het; her topmast,
28 feet; main boom, 37 feat; gaff, 23 feat, and bowsprit,
16 feet outboard.

A trip round the “block” last Thursday, al-
moat gave the idea of a public holiday, so many shutters
met the gaze. King-street was lifeless without its well-
dressed windows, and its crowds of ladles who stand
and peer thereinto during the sunny hours when bank
clerks and the young maa from the Lauds carry their
canes round. And Pitt-street parade was nnder a pall
of dullness. The diapers bad gone down the har-
bour for their jubilee. And it was a great gathering,
estimated at over three thousand, the largest respect-
able picnic wo believe ever held in Sydney. The whole
foren ion, targe steamers went to and fro, carrying their
freight down to the grounds, where every kind of sport
was kept going. A lovely day they had, and all about,
as the hours woie on, were seen groups with their
baskets and hampers, bottles and billies, camping under
the shades and in tho nooks and galliee of the big back
range, for the lunches, dinners, and “ snack i" of a'l
sorts, at all times that picnickers are wont to indulge
in. In the nature of things, most people knew each
other, and the general cordiality made the off Ur
pleasanter to all. Bat if anyone didn’t happen to know
some one, then would he flud some mutual friend who
did, and then would bo heird, “ Let me introduce Mr
Smith of the • shirts,’ ” or * Mr. Fitzrebinson, one of
Davy Jones's ‘slops,’ " and Mr. Jenkins, in Gardiner's
•fancy’ would gratify young Toispoons of the ‘Min-
Chester,’ by presenting him to “ Miss Da Vere, of
Hordern's show room," while Arabella Qhibelline of
Way’s ‘ mourning,’ would ba really charmed with Mr.
Smif kins, who hod j nst gone into the “ prints." Never
was there a more orderly picnic; there was not, so for
oa we could see, a sign of a single person having been
too ranch *• in the sun ’* Of course, many persons go
down the harbour who can’t see anything—Milesian
constables and missionary reporters, and so on—but it’s
different with us. Most unfortunately, the Isat time
there was anything to ba seen doing there, wa did aee it.
It need hardly be said Thursday’s scene was a gay one;
In the open centre were races, and ctf shore was a
regatta; dainty snmmer toilets, prints, zephyrs, and
Siotnreaqua sateens as unpretentious as they were pretty,
ottai ths plao i in every direction; quiet folks climbed
the hill in quest of terns, or fell into sentimental con-
verse “ out on tbs rooks, when the tide was low." Two
bands attended, and the pavilion was hot and crowded
all d ly : gold dancing was impossible on such a wretched
ff tor; the g iping boards o ivered with sand, the want of
Boats to rest on. and the choking sultriness of ths air
prevented any approximation to comfort. But oap«ring
is an essential at an Australian harbour picnic, and if it
cannot b» dine in comfort, its enthusiastic votaries will
do it in di ■‘comfort; so, in spite of the heat, the dust, and
the crowd, the racketing dance went on till the last
steamer left. Tae other structure was too small for
the junoheon party, so Compagnoni’s tnrkoys and torts
wtn served in a raarquAi. whe. e some 400 special ticket
holders eat down at 2 o’clock, Mr. M'Mhlan taking the
chair Tea toasts, wnioh means twenty speeches, were
propped and honored, the " Drapers’ Association"
by Mr. Pomeroy, being chief, representing as it
docs one of tho largest classes in the commercial com-
munity of the city, and having for its objects reasonable
hoars, fair play, sociability, and the welfare of both
employers and employed. Mr. Mason gave the "Em-
ployers," Mr, Shaw the " EmployAjs," and Mr. Poole
gave the "Committee” some of the praise they
deserve Mr. Sam Hordern neatly proposed ths "Whole-
sale Houses, *’ the “ Ladies ” were remembered, and Mr.
B. x. Price, the well-known School of Arts debater, on
the "Press," avoided the common platitudes, and
epoke sonnd sense in a few straight words. The speeches
ware rather long Miscellaneous mams are i Anthony
Hordern beat Davy Jones at cricket; refreshments were
buyable on the ground ; moat heads of houses wore pre-
sent ; eloaing of shops was nearly universal, though one of
the largest firms kept their whole staff at work through-
out the day. At the Circular Q lay a few of the old
habitats of Clontarf showed np, nnder the protection
of the Supreme Court, but they were not allowed to
the steamers. Indeed, Mr. Medlook’s manage-
went, sad the efforts of the committee were very credit-
able. Ba*b year, they will have to be mere careful still,
to prevent deterioration; for thp Sydney larrikin hears
the sounds of music afar off, and wherever there is
dancing he will go, if allowed. Now, we want to make
a remark au taste, for the benefit of whom it may con-
cern. There are yonng gentlemen of a certain close
who often go yachting on the waters of Port Jackson.
They wouldn’t be seen in a steamer going to a public
wienie—that would ba quite toe dreadful. Bat, when
there’s a picnic, and females are at it, they jnst happen
to there in their boats, and thsir not overoieon
olothes—without happening to have purchased tickets.
Some such young gentlemen were disconcerted on
Thursday by being requested to pay for their presence.
There's only one thing to prevent a person landing on
the shore, and intruding on a harbour picnic without
paying; and that is, a sense of the fact that he has no
business there If a youth lacks this sense and is
Uberajly endowed with “front,” ho oan picnic there
• ’ on the never ” to a (arse extent. Hauos arises the
question of taste. It's had tsate to go without paying ;
and it’s bad taste, anyhow, to go looking unclean and
uncouth, a gny among respectable people who are
neatly clad. » * »

dumb-bells opened the show, and a tng of war finished

The Protestant Hall never looked prettier than

crammed it, at Graham's Euphonic Concert Flags all
round, platform (lengthened right across the kail)
carpeted and edged with great globes of gold-fish, tiers
of seats covered in scarlet cloth, and filled with ladies,
who played violins, ’cellos, double bassos, cornets and
organ; while Miss Lena Mintey displayed her versa-
tility by performing on tympaui, kettledrum, brass
drum, cymbals, triangle and bells alternately, all by her-
telf It made us wonder why, after all, every mother’s
daughter in this progressive colony seams to regard it
as a solemn duty to persecute the helpless piano, when
there are so many other instruments she could be
equally unsuccessful with, at less cost to Pa.
Lord Charles Scott, youngest son of the Duke

Mr. A. C. Garrick, president, was honoured at
a picnic by the Trades Defence Association on Monday.
The banquet in the afternoon was exceptionally fine:
Sydney bonlfaoee will soon be noted for their liberal
dinners. Messrs. Dailey and Reid were guests, all the
other Ministers having seno apologies instead of them
selves. The Young Australian Bind was engaged.
Mr J P. Thompson, vioe-presideno of the Association,
presided. Mr. Dailey made a characteristically pointed
and ornate speech, and the toast of " Our Guest,"
given by the chairman, was well received, and olaverly
replied to by Garrick.
The employes of Messrs. Enoch Taylor and Co.,
who, with their wives and friends, numbered about 200,
proceeded by steamer to Tennyson on Saturday last, at
the invitation of Mr. Wilson, the Sydney partner of
the Arm, who is aboat to make a trip to Europe. The
afternoon was gloriously flue, though somewhat hot.
A programme of races afforded ample sport to many of
the picnickers, while a harp and violin in the pavilion
invited to the dance. A very excellent luncheon was
provided bv Oompagnoni. The principal toast was that
of "The Firm, ** everyone drinking* the health of Mr.

another, both wall attended, many visitors from other
colonies and naval officers being guests There was
great competition for the gallant glit-batten gentlemen,
for they had te be made the most of while there Naval
officers arc very important figures in the social circles
of the Australian colonies; they might almost be oal ed
the pillars on which society, at anyrate gay society,
rests. It would be easier to ask why than to answer
A lord is a very infrequent prize. They are, as a rule,
poor ; they know the girls are not after thorn, except
for temporary purposes, and a wide-awake society girl
seldom dreams of marrying one of them—and jet, w -.ile
they are there, the civilian youth only lives in an at wos-
phere of intense and ouier coldness. No one grudges
them having it pretty well their own way, unless perhaps
the aforeqiid civilian youth, for they arc mostly good
fallows. And mostly ploMant, for a varied and exten-
sive experience ia the art of dalliance with the fair has
rendered them irreds Uhls as gallants. They are such
artists in small talk that one wonders there is not a
general softening of the naval brain. Still, they bear
up well under the strain. They are so useful, too. It
is always safe to oak them ; because they are sure to
come. They are all dancing men, and evaa if they were
not, they look piotnrseqaa. In a ballroom, gilt battens,
*o , add variety ; while at dinner or tupper, their uni-
forms form a most effective yet inexpensive addition to
the i) iwcrs aqd other ornaments of the table.

The Colonial Sugar Company indulged in a large

items, a distribution of toys to children, and a drawing

silver watch and gold chain was found beside the bones,

An open verdict has been returned.
James Moore, a thickset young man, was found
guilty last week of criminally assaulting a girl of 14,
under circumstances of considerable brutality, and was
sentenced to ho banged. According to the evidence,
the girl was, immediately after the offence, taken to a
Dr. Jones, but he, " not wishing to be identified with
such a case,” declined to do more than cursorily ex.
amine her. Moore will not be hanged. How can we
hang him alter reprieving Plomer ?
A Chinaman, who was about to return,to the
Flowery Laud, lost one of his feet through washing it
In the Mossman River (N Q ), alter fifteen years’

what was causing all the mud, and, of course, took off

No one know? how the alligator feels.
The name of one of the men whom Bums,
recently tried and acquitted of the Stawell (headless
trunk) marder, is suspected ct having assassinated, was
Qninlivan. And now the decapitated bedy of another
man named Qninlivan has been fonnd in N.Z. One
John Davidson, in whose company the dead roan was
last seen, was, just prior to the discovery ot his mate’s
body, fonnd insensible on a road, with his throat out, a
raior being close by. The wonnd was not fatal, and
Lavidson was committed for attempted suicide.
Thomas Johnson, aged 55, while going through
a scrub near Adelaide with his daughter, tried to make
her smell chloroform. She refused to do so, whereupon
he went behind her and shot her between the shoulders.
At bis trial he detailed certain domestic grievances
which he said resulted from the girl’s conduct, and
alleged that she was wounded by carelessly handling his
pi-tol Judge Bonoant, after a verdict of guilty had
been returned, characterised the erime as a most dia-
bolical, cold-blooded, deliberate attempt to murder,
simply becacse the girl, who had been a good daughter,
had refused to remain at home. He sentenced prisoner
to imprisonment tor lifa.
Last January a man suicided In Elizabath-street
Sydney, by throwing himself nnder the tram. . His
mangled bo<*r »p ' ‘•’''ntiflad by a woman named Fowler
as that of h«» ‘ - i Before Mrs. Fowler hrfd quite
rec >vercd from «. * e*. the poor woman was fright*
oned oat of her wits ae her husband, Brill in the fleeh,
walking in the door The identification had been a mis-
take. That it was so is new made more clear by the
fact that last Saturday, at the Central Police Court,
John Fowler, the man who had n suicided," was bound
over to keep the peace towards his wife—and not to
ont her throat and tear her body limb from limb"—as
he had kindly promised to do.
The Melbourne correspondent of the AtrBTBA-
lasivn Medical Qazeete remarks that "the facts in
oouflrmatl m of the belief that the procuring of abor-
tion is reduced to a system here, and that those; jhho
practice it constitute a profession, are increasing. I
referred previously to the practice of this baunMs
among qualified practitioners, hat the oases now await-
ing investigation in the fcmpreme Court illustrate its
prevalence among midwivas, and it is expected there
will be some interesting revelations when the oases are
tried in the course of next week. It is said that seve-
ral ot these irregular practitioners, apprehensive of
the forthcoming disclosures compromising them, have
found it convenient to remove their business to another
colony, which probably is a prudent course." Yes, no
doubt they’ll arrive in Sydney, where there are already
lots of their kind. Everything just now is tending
towards federation.
Mr. Ernest Holdsworth, aged 21, eldest son of
the well-known Sydney solicitor, was drowned on Mon-
day morning while bafkins on *he oo an beach at
Manly. He swam out beyond the breakers, was caught
by a treacherous current, and found himself unable to
return. Mr, Frank Wrench pluokily went to his
rescue and conducted him in as far as the first sand-
bank, on which the two got temporary footing, but
from which they were almost instantly swept by a
roller. Then another huge wave eame, and when it
was past, Holdsworth had gone down and Wrench was
engaged in a desperate s ruggle to reach land. He was
completely exhausted when brought into shallower
water by Mr. K. S. Nyberg A pearl diver was
drowned later on Monday, while endeavouring to re-
cover the body ; nnd a water-policeman very narrowly
escaped a similar fate. Several other bathing accidents
also eoonired on the same day at the ocean beach, a
young man and a boy having been brought ashore un-
conscious.
Aldermanlo rows at Bnrwood. Mr. Archer, the
ex-Mayor, somehow or other became unpopular, and
was rejected at last election in favour of " young
blood; " but though no longer an alderman, he held his
seat pending the appointment of hie successor. Aider-
men Deakin and Bees were the candidates. Whethar
rightly or wrongly, the voting was declared even, and
the Mayor gave his casting vote for Alderman Bees.
"Some words’’—we quote a mild expression of the
Herald’s — thereupon ensued between Alderman
Deakin and Mr. Archer, and the former rose to take
forcible possession of the chair. Archer, however, was
too quick, whereupon the Alderman seised an American
chair, exclaiming, " Oh, all right, this will do as well."
But a seven-f; oter, Alderman Ryan, "Hr up,” and
seising the leg of the chair, disputed Deakin’s posses-
sion of the gimcrack article. A souffle ensued, in the
course of which the chair had two legs amputated and
its back broken. The fight meanwhile went on all
round the room, one set of aldermen telling another
set to "come outside.” At last, when there waq no
longer any ohair to sit on er fight for, the meeting was
adjourned by the Town Olerk. Mr. Alderman Deakin
is now Mayor. The Mayoralty of Bur wood is a position
of much dignity.

It will be seen at once from these sample
lints that the writer has the true aboriginal
Are We wonder what ha is! Wo always do
wonder what the writer is when we get snob verse as
this Jndgir-by the wild irregular rhythm and general
drunken mon ent of this poem wa should be inclined
to behove that \e writer was at one time court-poet to
hit now dofum Majesty, ling Thakombau. But
hit snlphurousn 's of epithet combined with, the ex.
tentivo knowleds he displays of the wheels within
wheals of Satanic —plomacy, convinces ns that he must
bo either a missionary or the devil in person. Perhaps
he is both. The pathos, however, ot soma of t he un-
gaoted lines, in whioh he mourns the downfall of
Levuka suggests 1 1 ns yet another theory, which is,
that he may be a water-rat. Water-rats are said to be
very emotional creatures, and those in the wharves at
Levuka must feel tha decrease in shipping very keenly.
Besides, the poem, taken as a whole, is just the sort of
thing whioh an emotional water-rat migh. write.
That’s why we have forwarded it to Alfred.
