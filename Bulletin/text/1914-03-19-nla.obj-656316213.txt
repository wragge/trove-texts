If we knew how to make a better preservative
paint we’d do so. We believe that P&B is the
best paint of its kind made. Its base is a
mineral that is practically indestructible, and
possesses great resistance to moisture, acids and
alkalies, while its solvent is one of the most
penetrating liquids known. P & B Paint does
not injure the -surface to which it is applied—
wood, metal or fibre.

The Country of the Damned
The Red Page
There is, on this earth, a Country of the
Damned, and a lost soul has just got back.
Singularly little has been known of this
country, owing to the fact that false reporls
a ® I “ variab |y sent out by the People Who
v Damned. But the lost soul spent six
thTSlft y tw S , t lere ’ made more dl> eadful by
5, Ct , that he was an Englishman “who
had the honor to be educated at one of the
laige public schools”; and he got out of his
The Pel h rwr k T g ° T r , losing any mon ey.
ho Are Damned are damned
*°7. eed ’ 1S no question that each gene-
nii de T at f physically and morally.
In that country financial crisis has followed
hnancial crisis with short intervals, and
millions of more men and hundreds of mil-
civnUi m f oney ,have to be expended before
vilised life and financial security are to be
really reached. The people are unique:
Jrfy are not even English. Englishmen
there are as much abroad as they would be
in Russia. They are horrified at finding the
daughters of well-to-do men, possessed of
comfortable homes, serving behind the
counters of shops, rubbing shoulders on an
equality with common shop assistants. And
the men have uncouth speech and manners.
In business they are dishonest: it does not
appear to them dishonorable to repudiate a
™i o{^°y\COnt ™ ct ' This nati <® d «es not
speak English. Englishmen landing there
find the greatest difficulty in making them-
selves understood, or indeed, comprehending
others with, any facility for the first few
days. This is not due to their extraordinary
pronunciation or their ungrammatical sen-
tences, but to their slang. This slang, un-
couth as thieves’ jargon, is peculiarly irri-
tating to English ears. The peculiar part—
to an Englishman where each county has a
jargon incomprehensible to inhabitants of
a 6 m all the Damned speak alike.
A girl brought up at the best ladies’ college
can comprehend perfectly and carry on a
conversation admirably with an uneducated
boot-black. Associating with this people
vitiates an Englishman’s speech terribly,
even though one had the honor to be edu-
cated at onegof the large English public
schools, and sometimes no little embarrass-
ment is caused by making a slip on returning
to more exacting society. There are posi-
tively not six good-looking men in that
Country of the Damned. It systematically
produces ugly men.
&
The women are worse. One reason is
that the men cruelly deny their wives ser-
vants, whereas the obvious remedy for this
domestic difficulty would be to import for-
eigners to do the work, preferably Chinese
or Indians. There are even Damned women
who actually prefer to do their own washing
rather than send it to a Chinese laundry.
House-work in the Country of the Damned
means decadence of the race. Decadence
after less than a century and a half’s exist-
ence! But such is the fact. Proof of the
rigor of the climate and the effect of the
women’s slavery in it is to be had in the
low birth-rate obtaining all over the Coun-
try of the Damned. The health of the
Damned nation is shocking now, and it can
only be brought back to virility by taking
care of the womenfolk. Few married Eng-
lishmen would bring out their wives if they
knew the conditions under which they would
be compelled to live in the Country of the
Damned.
Many Damned girls are very pretty in
their extreme youth, but not prettier than
English or French girls. But they age pre-
maturely. The fact remains that at 25 years
of age, or in many cases even earlier, the
Damned girl has said “good-bye” to her
youth and fresh looks for ever. There are
in all the Country of the Damned not six
cases in which the physical charm of the
girls remains beyond the early twenties.
Their teeth start to go almost as soon as the
second set appears; their hair suffers equal
ravages. In early youth a girl may have a
lovely crop of prettily-colored hair; but
within a few years the sun has bleached
away the individual tint, and the dry air
has thinned it out terribly. Complexions,
too, simply do not exist. It is impossible to
maintain a good skin in the Country of the
Damned, the desiccating north winds take
good care of that; whilst the constant glare
imparts a strained look to the eyes conse-
quent on ceaseless puckerings. The slim,
lissom, well-built English girl has no counter-
part in the Country of the Damned. Her
walk is a waddle. With hands glued tight
to their sides, and every muscle apparently
held tense, they pass down the street wob-
bling from side to side. As for their morals,
they go to theatres and other entertain-
ments, escorted by men acquaintances and
without any chaperone! However, though
it is always a very risky proceeding, one
would a hundred times rather see an Eng-
lishman married to a Damned woman, than
see an Englishwoman married to a Damned
man.
*
The children are still worse. They go
to State schools, and these schools are hot-
beds of vice; and it is safe to say that no
boy or girl attending one of them for a year
has anything to learn about the relation of
the sexes. The parents know perfectly well
what goes on in these schools, and yet one
hears of no protests.
Owing to the success of the Damned in
stamping out professional vice in their coun-
try, it falls to the married woman and the
unmarried girls living at home to supply the
deficiency. Damned married women are
courted ceaselessly from this point of view,
and it is small matter for wonder if many
of them prove unfaithful to their husbands.
As for the Damned girls, the great liberty
acceded to girls of all ages makesy seduction
per.ectly easy, and every opportunity is
eagerly availed of for promiscuous im-
morality. In the Country of the Damned
the men do not demand purity in the woman
they intend to marry. The number of
forced marriages, in which the guilty parties
have been found out, is simply stupendous.
\lhe Damned hold, if not actually express,
the opinion that the women should have the
same freedom as the men before marriage.
Hell, they get what they want, and that is
wives of far from spotless purity. Finally,
purity is much rarer in the Country of the
Damned, and much harder to retain, than in
many other countries. And those who do
retain it receive no help from either Damned
men or Damned legislators.
The manufactures of , the Country of the
Damned are vastly inferior to similar manu-
factures in other countries. Damned-made
pianos, furniture, cloth, boots, groceries,
tinned foods, biscuits and confectionery
would simply fail to get a market elsewhere.
Ihey are universally fifth-rate, and even in
the Country of the Damned, despite the high
protective tariff, hundreds of people refuse
to buy locally-made things if an imported
article can be procured. This is the fault
of the workmen. They are deficient as to
speed and strength, with the exception of
sheep-shearers and some axemen. They can-
not hold a candle to many black races, even
when it comes to heavy toil, either on the
S p°rr- wor h done or endurance. A gang
ot Kaffir and Zulu ship-coaling coolies will
do twice as much work per man as any set
of. Damned navvies. Even the much de-
spised Kanaka can give the Damned points
in mere heavy labor. And on the face of the
Damned workman there is an expression of
sullen resentment and confirmed boredom
due to his discontent.
In this .Country of the Damned there are
several things that Englishmen miss. The
beauty spots are absolutely ugly and com-
monplace. Also, there aren’t any. There is
no pretty landscape in the whole Damned
Country. Then there isn’t enough water
and even that isn’t 'nice. That is why the
Damned have the national habit of invete-
rate drinking. Most of the meat is tough
and flavorless And, finally, the People of
the Damned have no sense of humor—no
person in. the Country of the Damned can
see anything amusing in English Punch !
Jt
By the way, the Country of the Damned
is Australia, and the lost soul who has
escaped from it is C. E. Jacomb. He dedi-
cates his boob, God's Own Country (Max
Goshen), to all English Public School and
University Men; and every one of the in-
credible lies stated above is quoted accu-
rately from that publication. God’s Own
Country is the finest exposure yet vouch-
safed us of. the soul of the Englishman,
lo expose his falsehoods is needless here*
Jacomb never mentions statistics; but this
farrago of spleen and ignorance, circulating
among the still more ignorant English, can
do much harm. It happens, however, that
Australia possesses a Wide Commissioner
whose duty, between meals, is to represent
m England this Commonwealth of the
Damned. We put the matter before him.
. . Jacomb has insulted and vilified two
million Australian women. What is G H
Reid going to do about it? We would sug-
gest a duei, were it not that C. E. Jacomb
would havg a 2 to 1 advantage in targets.

Personality in Literature, by R. A Sorwt-
James (Seeker, per Sydney Book Club) is
an interesting book of literary discussion
and criticism The author writes lucfdTw
nf d rhfl S so “ etlnn £ to sa y- His appreciations
of the moderns are shrewd and intimate.
Of Shaw, as a speaker, he remarks • “He
never loses his thread like Chesterton • he
wlfls W f? der . s off “to y ague rhetoric ’like
wff h u ses hls enemie s and his sub-
ec u untH he has subdued the first and set
forth the second so that it shines with cry-
stal clearness. There is no man in England
who can state a case, on the platform or hr
the press, with, such perfect lucidity, such
logical order, with such brightness and force
as Bernard Shaw. He is the greatest de-
bater in England, the greatest pamphleteer
m °st observable personality in public
hfe.” Also: “As an organiser there is no
one who has more driving power He is
a first-rate business man. He knows as
much about the trade of
publisher He refuses to employ
agent, and personally transacts the business
of placing his work in the literary and
dramatic market all over the world.” - And
Scott-James has the phrase-making knack
as when he remarks that Arnold Bennett’s
subject is the tragi-comedy of growing old ”
This book is pleasant browsing for the lifera-
Since its inception the Melb. Repertory
Theatre has produced 33 plays, ranging from
Ibsen to William Moore. The following au-
thors were represented twice: Galsworthy,
Esson, Hankin and Ibsen. Of Shaw seven
plays were presented. Pour seasons of Aus-
tralian drama are announced for this year,
the plays to be presented being The Image
Breaker, by Alfred Buchanan; Quo Vadim-us,
Femin&f by M. E. Wilkinson; Mrs. Pretty
and the Premier , by Arthur H. Adams; John
Brandon, Scientist, by Celia Manning; and
plays, the titles of which are not yet given,
by Louis Esson, Ethel Turner, John Lada-
veze, Kathleen Watson Deardon, Ray Phil-
lips and others. Gregan McMahon is to be
congratulated on his pluck.
My Wander Year, by Ada A. Holman
(William Brookes, Sydney), is a facilely
written account of Mrs. Holman’s recent
trip to Europe. She had many opportuni-
ties of meeting, interesting personalities; of
them she furnishes neat and incisive pen-
pictures. Her comments are pleasantly Aus-
tralian. her descriptions acute and femininely
detailed. A readable introduction to London
and Europe. i-

February
Forty-three Februaries, and again a high
level of achievement. A salamander, a
witch, a scorpion, a gipsy, a nark—our
February is all these. B.M.N. requires 16
lines to say all she wants of the month, and
“Hopalong” and H.8.H., in their anger, for-
get all about the sonnet form. Fair sonnets
were submitted by Thos. V. Tierney, “Un-
dine,” L. J. Villiers, Mabel M. Nagle,
kS.J.M. and E.8.A., the two last spoiling
their efforts by a wrong rime-scheme.
/Ecnirp” introduces a trochaic line in an
interesting effort.
“Mick Much,” as usual, obliges with some-
thing Australian and neat, the word “plates”
being the technical term for rails.
The pick en’ shovel ain’t so soft a toill
I done me dash en’ ’ere I’m wiv a camp
Thet lays the plates through spinifex an’ swamp,
vV ere blokes ’ave guyver’d ’bout the lovely soil,
Wile all the breathin’ sky’s just on the boil.
It ain’t alright, en’, ’struth! some’s dead to tramp
The payday follerin’ w’en there’s bin some damp.
So s coots kin tell all liquid isn’t oil.
The seaside caper en’ the surf en’ sand,
Were tarts chuck off their duds to git the sun,
Is right per’aps, but thet game wuzn't plann’d
l ( er eny man escept a bloomin’ gun.
This job’s the start thet’s got to ring the land—
Its solid, but, my oath, it’s somethun’ done.
Mick Much.
. T.Y.T. provides something dramatic
in two acts, accompanied by a note that,
owing to pressure on this page’s floor space,
the hies are omitted from the dialogue:—
ACT I.
A shonnet—yesh, shi’U stry it, strike me pink 1
Hut shay, ol’ shap—whash blanky monchish thish?

Excellent sonnets —the difficulty of choice
grows with each succeeding competition—
are supplied by Mrs. 0. E. Moore (winner of
last months competition), L. A. Boylett,
Kurrajong,” Alexa Proudfoot, “Last Hope,”
Herbert Tracey, L. Sparrow (who splits the
int ? t™ o syllables), Leslie Lee,
M.D.K., Mary A. B. Bobb (two engaging
entries, one, however, with a false rime),
ai j ~ n , n (two entries, one humorous
and the other with a fine end to a weak
beginning) :
Thy scant and stormy tears
Fall less in sorrow than in hysteric rage.
Bemain five sonnets, all with something
to say. Syd. C. begins brilliantly, but tails
ott into vagueness.
The quivering plains lie breathless in the
glow
Of noontide’s keen, intolerable gold;
The glittering seas with warm, white arms
enfold
A slumb’rous land; from cloudy ranges flow
h amt, aromatic smoke wreaths, soft and
slow,
In filmy wefts of fantasy unrolled
To mask the day, and through the night to
hold
A sorcerer’s moon, ensanguined, large and
low.
The rich quintessence of a Summertide,
All passionately quickened with the pain
Of Time’s irrevocable mandate, lies
In February’s lapj yet drowsy eyed
She dreams of chill winds whistling flecked
with rain
’Neath skies o’ercast, and dreaming softly
sighs.
Victoria. s td . 0.
\ weak third line spoils the fine imagery
of A. Gore-Jones :
The turbid month is here with hot, grey
hours,
And ripe fruit rotting ’neath each empty
tree,
’Mid fleeting sun rays of intensity,
Or xvhirling gusts of sudden warm wet
showers.
A tattered drift, the frangipani flowers.
The sombre gums, a tossing, leafy sea
Imprisoned forces striving to be free;
While over all the threat’ning tempest lours.
Strange spirits of the pending storm infest
The humid atmosphere, and breed distrust,
Until grave doubts arise that chill the blood.
Oh! will dead Summer sink to quiet rest
Amid a rank green world; or, ruled by lust.
The wild month drown her corpse in roaring
flood?
QUEENSLAND. A. GORE-JONES.
The lesson of the final three sonnets is
the absolute necessity of technical correct-
ness. Nina Murdoch writes the finest sonnet
in this month’s competition, yet she is cast
out because her ear does not tell her that the
rune "ravines-intervenes” is no rime; and
her fault is the more glaring since these
rimes are placed in juxtaposition:—
The Rains are coming! February leans
Above the land, with slender hands em-
browned,
Curved to her joyous lips’ carnation round
And shouts the message to the parchei
ravines.
And though the blackened grass-tree inter
venes
On ravished heath and white-hot plain, the
sound
Quickens with vivid dreams the scorching
ground
And wakens dead desire of luscious greens.
Now swift like rushing brumbies come the
Rains,
Churning the creeks and bowing down the
grass.
The gypsy month laughs low as they draw
near
With flying feet and sweeping silver manes,
Then fearless-eyed she leaps before they pass
And rides upon the foremost down the year.
N.s.w. Nina Murdoch.
Duncan Brown, with a sonnet Australian
and finely patriotic, makes the same error in
taste. He rimes “pall” with “appal,” though
he lias done better in keeping the lines in
which these words occur well apart:—
Though February’s days the red fires sweep
A/irf drape the torrid sky with smoky pall;
Adown astonished Heaven seem to fall
The blood red sun and half seen moon, to
creep
Aghast from such an enemy. Sweet sleep
Is banished by the pregnant dreaded call,
J nat well may blanch, but never can appal
■I he men who fight their sweat-earned homes
to keep.
Undaunted sons of this great southern world,
Be yours the spirit that directs our fate,
And yours the strength that shall drive home
our blows
When in the northern sky we see unfurled
T1 ar’s bloody flag, and hear approach our
gate
The thunder of the marching of our foes.
VIC - Duncan Bbown.
Technicality, combined with an original
and arresting fancy, enables S. Elliott
.Napier (23 Queen-street, Mosman) to win,
and for the second time. His sonnet is dig-
ged and truthfully Australian; but his
concluding thought, though refreshing, has
not the pulse-quickening thrill of that of
Nina Murdoch’sand Syd C. comes a close
SftPBnn TOT* fho
FEBRUARY.
By S. Elliott Napier.
The scorpion summer — ev'ry burnish'd scale
Aflame with mortal agony and hate —
Grawls, blind and frenzied, to his venom’d
fate
And stabs his life out with his armed tail!
The sun is brazen and the shies are mail;
The airy argosies bear dusty freight;
And, see! The witches of the wind gyrate
O er that which, once so green, has grown so
pale!
But, ah! Though February, burnt and bare,
May claim- and take—his toll a little space,
Above his wailing western winds that parch
And through the haze that weights his sad-
den'd air,
There comes a whisper of autumnal grace:
There breathes a promise of the rains of
March!

.22 Caliber Cartridges
Different makes of cartridges look very
much alike but you don’t buy cart-
ridges for looks. What you want is
efficiency. That’s why you should
buy Winchester Cartridges. Win-
chester .22 Caliber Cartridges, either
black, “Lesmok *•* or smokeless pow-
der, are loaded by automatic machin-
ery. This insures uniform charges of
powder and properly seated bullets,
which are essential for accurate shoot-
ing. Winchester smokeless cartridges
are loaded with Greaseless bullets,
which are clean to handle and
prevent loss of powder strength.
It is easy to be a penny wise and
a pound foolish in buying cartridges.

A CORRECTLY
A WOMAN’S BIRTHRIGHT!
BUST!
Every woman can have a perfect figure. A deficiency in bust is
readily corrected by Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food treatment. The best
evidence is that of those who have used it. It is never-failing. See
what MRS. E. WINGROVE, of Gympie, Queensland, a skilled nurse,
says of its efficacy:—
“After leaving off your treatment I waited several months
lo see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
1 now wish to say that I think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Before adopting it I was only skin and bones,
but now I am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it and really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-
tations. My health and appearance have improved most
satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”
Wo haven’t room to give you more letters here like this one, but we will send you scores of
them upon request. We possess thousands of grateful testimonials.
Many cases gain as much as 51b. a week, and improvements up to as much as ten inches
have been made in the bust measurements. Guarantee given in every case.
Put up in tablet form, it is pleasant to take, and palatable. It leaves no unpleasant after-
effects, and the results are permanent and lasting. It can be taken secretly.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

VARIOUS VERSE
A Love Song of a Meat Strike.
The butcher is my dear;
He brings me pounds of steak,
And begs of me, you hear,
To eat it for his sake!
And so I do, for fear
His sheepish heart should break.
With beef and mutton too,
Wrapped up in snowy white,
The butcher comes to woo
His lady ev’ry night.
He kneels and sighs, “For you l" —•
A very grateful sight.
Last night he brought pig’s cheek
And trotters by the pound;
I gave a little shriek
And lightly danced around;
Although his mien was meek,
His joy was most profound.
He twiddled with his hat,
And smiled a greasy smile,’
While I admired the fat,
Pink pig got up in style.
In ecstasy he sat —
A Cupid done in “ile.”
The butcher is my dear;
But dearer are the things,
With many a loving leer,
He nightly me-ward brings.
Each parcel leaves a smear
That to his garments clings.
No chocolates or flow’rs
Weigh down my greasy boy’;
But through the loving hours
He brings me steak with joy,
And trotters fairly showers,
While with a chop I toy.
My love with steak is here!
He waves beef at my door! !. ...
The butcher is my dear —
And will be till it’s o’er!
N.S.W.
Anne Carnivora.
The Blessed Lambozel.
The blessed lambozel leaned out
From the hash house of Heaven ;
Her eyes were like the gravy of
Lamb cutlets cooked at even;
She had a large plate in her hand
And the chops on the plate were seven.
Ller robe, ungirt from clasp to hem
No cornflour did adorn,
But bottles of tomato sauce
Around her neck were worn;
Her hair that lay along her back
Put hare that’s jugged to scorn.
It was a gorgeous butcher’s shop
That she was standing on,
All hung with mutton, lamb and pork
And veal and venison :
Herseemed it scarce had been a day
Since meat strikes had begun.
To me it is two weeks of weeks,
Yet here, in this same place,
Surely she leaned o’er me —her chops
Fell all about my face;
I stayed not for politeness nor
Delayed to murmur grace.
Circlewise lay they on the plate—-
These lamb chops, garlanded
With sprigs of parsley freshly plucked
And crumbed with crumbs of bread :
She gazed and listened all the while
I ravenously fed.
She gazed and listened and then said,
Less sad of speech than mild:
“What will you take for second course?”
I ceased, for I was filled
With cutlets and a great content.
Her lips moved and she smiled.
(I saw her smile!) But soon her path
Was vague mid distant spheres,
And then she fled me like dream steak
Adown the meatless years.
I bought a jug of counter lunch .
And wept. (These are my tears!)

Dawn on the Murray.
Silver-tipped are the gum trees stately,
Shod with silver their mantles green,
Silver plumes in his crest, sedately
Murray rolls like a King, between ;
Silver-throated the bush birds’ chorus,
Silver-frosted the Plains before us,
Silver-tinted the Dawn steals o’er us
Shedding glory upon the scene.
* * * *
Carol sweet of a glad thanksgiving,
Pealing forth from a Kuba tree,
Kindles fires of the joy of living,
Thrills my breast with an ecstasy.
Soul of mine! he’s a songster clever —
Butcher bird by the Murray River;
I could list to his lay for ever,
Angel songs are his songs to me.
Dawn-Wind, dewy, with fragrance laden
Sweeping soft from the snow-capped peak;
Orchards many the Vagrant strayed in
■ Many the bends of the musk-fringed creek;
Scaling the mountain crest to gather
Breath of pine from his cloak of heather,
With musk and apple and pine together
He sprinkles Dawn on her dappling cheek.
* * * *
Hills and Oceans our Poets singing
Weave their hearts in their metric themes ;
Seed and breed of the plains, I’m bringing
Gift of song to the King of Streams.
Though little of love, and less of laughter
Lighten the life of the lone Bush Grafter,
A Murray bend, in the great hereafter
In a six by eight is mv dream of dreams.

THE HOLMAN GOVERNMENT’S
BUDGET.
The N.S.W. financial statement propounded
by the Holman Ministry is a remarkable
affair. In the first place, it is nearly nine
months late. It is presented when the
financial year is approaching its conclusion.
That is an amazing example of loafing and
lingering. There was an election half-way
through the financial year, and a Govern-
ment which reckoned its monetary methods
could stand inspection might reasonably have
got in early with a statement of how it pro-
posed to run the Treasury, so that the state-
ment would help it on polling day. On the
other hand, a Government which knew that
its methods were utterly incapable, might
reasonably leave its statement till after the
election, lest the thing should ruin it on poll-
ing day. The lloi.man Ministry, for one
reason or another, left its announcement till
after the contest was over. Consequently it
avoided certain awkward questions. Before
polling day the people were assured, by one
Minister or another, that the Sydney tram
fares would not be increased, and the assur-
ance was, presumably, supposed to be good
for a few votes, else it is difficult to see why
it should have been made. It now appears
that the fares are to be increased, and the
chances are that a lot of people who voted
tor this impudent combination of political
frauds are surprised. The absentee tax is a
prominent feature of the Labor policy, and
it was perhaps well to tell the public after —
not before—the election, that the one impost
which was to be abolished was an absentee
tax. This sort of thing is so cynical in its
lack of all semblance of political principle
that the Holman Government ought, at the
general election in 1910, to be dead as a mat-
ter of certainty, but it is quite seriously sus-
pected that it doesn’t intend to go to the
country and be dead in 1916, though, in the
ordinary course of events, the life of the
present Parliament will end then. A casual
remark by an affable but injudicious Labor
member, who said that it was fixed in its
billet for four years (not three), lends color
to the report that it proposes to add a year
to its duration by Act of Parliament. To
extend its life to 25 years, by postponing the
next election till 1938, might be overdoing
things, but the report of a year’s extension
cloesmt look entirely beyond belief. It would
be difficult to credit such a thing in the case
of any ordinary Ministry, but with this aggre-
gation wondrous things may befall. For
instance, it made little secret of the fact that
its famous bargain with Speaker Willis pro-
vided for an early dissolution, and that it
broke its pledge simply because a certain bye-
election gave it a new majority and put it in
a position to break its pledge with impunity.
Apparently it is short of the instincts which
make a promise valuable.
The work of completely overhauling the
Holman Government’s finance must be post-
poned until more information is available.
It is only possible now to deal with a few
points. In 1900, the last complete financial
year of the pre-Federation days, N.S.W. paid
its way on a revenue of about £10,000,000.
Lertainly it was a case of undue and cheese-
paring economy, for that was when the State
had to provide for its own military and naval
defence, its own postal and telegraph expen-
diture, and its own old-age pensions. Now
that all these outgoings and a few more are
met by the Federal authority, Premier and
1 reasurer llolman reckons that he will be
able to get through next year (1914-1915) if
he collects a little over £20,000,000. But for
PT eat re li e f he has experienced through
the C oramonwealth taking over so many of
his spending departments, he might possibly
have wanted £3o,ooo,ooo—he would almost
certainly have wanted £25,000,000. A great
deal of the increased expenditure is under-
stood to have gone in improving the condition
of the people. Yet, as strikes are more
numerous than they ever were before, and as
in B.W. has more of them now than all the
other States put together, and the discussion
about the increased cost of living and the
house famine and the high-rent misery has
become really intense, the people seemingly
fail to realise that Holman and Co. have
greatly improved their condition.
The financial policy to which the party now
in office was pledged, when it secured the
loaves and fishes, included reduction of
borrowing, sound finance, and the application
of loan moneys only to works which would
pay full interest and sinking fund. The sink-
ing fund idea was greatly emphasised by ex-
Premier McGowen in some of his more vigor-
ous moments. But, unfortunately, borrow-
ing hasn’t been reduced; rather it has been
multiplied by about three, and loan
expenditure now reaches the staggering total
of £8,500,000 per annum —a figure never
before heard or dreamt of in this country.
The new loan money, instead of paying inter-
est and sinking fund, is invested so'badly that
the big public works which used to show a
handsome profit, can now only be kept out
of insolvency by a heavy increase of the
charges made to the public. Instead of a
new sinking fund being established as
against the new debt, the paltry payments
which used to be made against the old debt
have been suspended. The trifling amount
that used to be paid out of revenue in aid of
public works, so that some small fragment of
the community’s assets might not be mort-
gaged quite up to the neck, has been sus-
pended also. The honest and capable finance
has degenerated—in these prosperous days
of good harvests, high prices, big loans, big
booms and a lavish transfer of State liabili-
ties to the Commonwealth—into the biggest
deficit in the State’s record. The position
is so bad that it is found necessary to put
on new taxes and charges to the extent of
nearly £1,900,000 per annum. The deficit
may be accounted for in one of two ways.
Either the McGowen-llolman Government
was so utterly imbecile or incompetent that
it failed to see where it was going, or else
it didn’t think it advisable to tell the com-
munity where it was going till after election
day. Holman’s wordy explanation of the
case is interesting. It boils down to a state-
ment that the balance-sheet went wrong be-
cause the money that went out was a lot
more than the money that came in. Which
is much the same as a medical verdict that
the deceased died through not living any
longer.
* * * *
There were some large and eloquent pro-
posals about decentralisation in the Govern-
ment’s programme, but the big landlords and
big, rich, congested interests of Sydney still
run the show, and nothing has been decen-
tralised. Incidentally N.S.W. has just had
the worst railway slaughter in its history,
and the worst, bar one. in Australian his-
tory, as a warning that the policy of driving
all the trains of a great State to one city
may lead to overcrowding. Then one train
gets on top of another. After that comes
chaos, and after the chaos come the funerals.
To a party which had less luck at the second
ballots all this combination of breakages
might look like irreparable disaster ahead.
But the folk now in office at Sydney seem
to have very great luck at the second ballots.
COMPULSORY AGRICULTURE.
The super-tax on land proposed by the
N.S.W. Government is a somewhat compli-
cated instrument which aims at forcing more
soil into cultivation. There are necessarily
a multitude of exceptions and exemptions in
a matter of this kind. The foundation of the
measure lies in the proposal to make the
surface of N.S.W., for 15 miles on each side
of a railway or navigable river, or for 15
miles beyond the terminus of a railway,
liable to pay a large special impost provided
the Government proclaims the district “land
locked.” There seems to be no fixed rule
for deciding that this place is “landlocked”
and that place isn’t. It is purely a matter
of the Government’s discretion. Counting
up the mileage of N.S.W. railways and of
navigable rivers, and making reasonable
deductions for places where railways are not
oO miles apart, or where a railway and a
navigable river are less than 30 miles apart,
so that the whole 15-mile area can’t be taxed
in each case without levying on the same
land twice, and throwing in a discount for
places where a railway runs within 15 miles
of the sea, so that one side of the tax would
fall overboard and be drowned, and allowing
further for the fact that in the case of one
navigable river—-the Murray—only the north
bank can be levied upon—making all these
reservations a very large area will come
under the Act. Possibly something like
60,000 square miles, or over 38,000,000
acres, will be affeeted, barring exceptions.
Exceptions include land in municipalities
and suburban areas, cow lands, mining
lands, holdings worth less than £5OOO, and
some other details. The landowner who
doesn’t escape through any of these holes
may be compelled to cultivate at least half
his ground or pay up. The paying-up de-
pends on whether his district is proclaimed
or not, and that depends on how
the Government feels about things. The
special tax runs as high as 9d. in
the £, which means practical confiscation.
On the surface of things, nobody can object
to that. The man who holds land and keeps
it lying idle while the community requires
the use of it deserves practical confiscation
—provided the community has given him a
fair show.
* * * *
Sometimes, as it happens, the community
hasn’t given him much of a show. Many
an individual holds an area of fertile land
of great speculative value (because even the
most congested community may recover its
senses some day)—land quite handy to a
good, deep water port, and adjacent to the
place where there ought to be a big city to
buy his produce, and yet he does little or
nothing with his property. There is no city
on the deep water port—nothing but crabs
and beaches and emptiness, and hopes for
the future. There is no railway to it, and
often no road worth mentioning—only the
path of expectation. There isn’t a wharf
or a ship, though there are dreams. Sydney
harbor is the only deep-water port in the
State which is pampered with abundance of
railways, wharves, docks, cranes and other
necessary appliances. Beside it is the one
great city site in N.S.W. which is allowed
to have a city upon it. And when Sydney
is 200 or 300 needless miles away, that pro-
prietor of many rich acres may have a lot
of. dignity but very little immediate profit.
His bullocks and sheep do a long, dreary
perish in the trucks on the long, congested
railways, and many of them die, and those
that reach their destination alive are depre-
ciated, and largely eaten up by expenses.
His wheat lingers and rots on the local rail-
way station because the interminable lines
that converge on the one port are blocked
at the converging point by innumerable
trains, and because the vehicle that has to
travel 300 miles there and 300 miles back
can only do a fraction of the duty it might
do if its run was only 100 miles. Quite
recently there were over 5,000.000 bags of
wheat stranded or bogged at N.S.W. country
railway stations. If this remote, outlying
person tries to send cabbages and other
things which the Yankees describe as
“garden truck” to the one big market, a faded
vegetable arrives largely devoured by freight
charges. It gets there behind time, and is
sold for less than was expected. Also, the
accounts are probably faked by a middleman
who is too far away to be carefully audited,
and the grower sometimes ends by finding
himself in debt. If compulsory agriculture
is only to make the trucked bullock deader,
and the cabbage later, and to cause
10,000,000 bags of wheat to be stranded by
the wayside instead of 5,000,000, and to
force the landowner to hunt round suddenly
for thousands of agricultural laborers who
don’t exist, there is little hope in it.
* * * *
The sort of individual described can’t be
driven to wholesale agriculture even by
being proclaimed a land-locked district and
smitten with a super-tax of 9d. in the £.
His oppressor is not only the Fat Man but
the Fat City. There is a land-tax and a
graduated land-tax already, and they have
done some good, but they can’t accomplish
impossibilities. The great essential is a
convenient market and the nearest possible
outlet for exports. And the man who is
located at the far end of things finds the
Fat City blocking his way at every turn.
THE MAN WHO WASN’T SMITH.
An atmosphere of weariness collects about
the dispute re the fairness or unfairness of
the last New South Wales State election —
the event which gave the Holman Govern-
ment a much-needed majority on the second
ballot. The Liberal party—the one which
didn’t win—hints at things, but doesn’t
hint very definitely. Its leader is a cum-
brous person without a really crushing hint
about him. The Government party—the
one which did win-—smites its chest hard
like the gorilla drumming on its tummy in
the African forest, and asks for solid proof.
It wants the personating person and the
fraudulent voter produced, so that they may
be slain to the last extremity of the law.
And they aren’t produced in any quantity
worth mentioning. The whole position is
unsatisfactory.
* * * *
At one time the individual who was suffi-
ciently energetic to worry about the public
affairs of the glorious Ma State put himself
on the register and received an elector’s
right. He produced this document when
he went to vote, and a stamp was put upon
it, thereby making it impossible that it
should be used again at the same election.
Unless the right was lost, lent, stolen, un-
lawfully pawned or unlawfully sold for
drink, personation was impossible and fraud
was out of the question. And, seeing that
the lost or stolen right could be reported
and “stopped,” like the lost or stolen cheque,
there were really no chances of deception
except with the elector’s connivance or by
reason of the elector’s mental shortage. In
course of time, however, an idea arose that
the job of taking care of the simple docu-
ment might be beyond the elector’s capacity.
It seemed to involve too much mental struggle
and wear and tear. Certain people held
that a man might be quite capable of help-
ing to guide the destinies of the country, yet
wholly unable to remember where an essen-
tial bit of paper was located. The document
wasn’t harder to keep track of than a
cheque, or a union ticket, or a tram ticket,
or a TAtteksalr.’s ticket, or a railroad or
steamboat ticket, or a theatre ticket, or a
pawn ticket, or a rent receipt. Yet it was
decided that the burden might be too great.
So a new system arose similar to the one
which would prevail if cheques were abol-
ished, as documents that were liable to be
mislaid, and a man simply went into a bank
and said that a certain customer had ordered
that the bank should pay him so much
money, whereupon he received the money
and left for parts unknown. A man may
go into a polling-booth and say he is Smith
when he isn’t Smith, or when he is a differ-
ent Smith. If he is a wise man he selects
a booth in an outlying part of Smith’s elec-
torate, where that person isn’t likely to be
known. There is very little chance that he
will be known himself, for, unless he is a
complete lunatic, he only does this sort of
game when far from his customary haunts.
Thus, for all political purposes, he can be
Smith. Likewise, he can go round the
various polling-booths, and, with similar
precautions, be Brown, Jones, Robinson,
Blenkinsop, Parker and Drinkwater.
Also, he can. be Borndrunk and Ciiollop.
When the real Brown arrives too late, and
finds his vote gone, he can only say things
about the sinfulness of the bogus Brown. On
the other hand, should the bogus Parker
be too late he covers his retreat by .express-
ing his horror at the wickedness of the real
Parker. Within certain limitations, any
vote belongs to the person who gets there
first. Of course, if the actual Ciiollop
votes at the polling-booth nearest his resi-
dence, and several dubious Ciiollops vote
at several other booths, an investigation
must lead to annoyance, but all the annoy-
ance in the world doesn’t clear up the mys-
terylf any party does its best, or if both
parties do their best, success is a matter of
organisation, enterprise and early rising.
Then the party which says it was de-
feated through fraud clamors for justice to
the party which, it alleges, won by fraud.
In reply, it is told to produce the offender —
the pretended Robinson —that it com-
plains .of, and when he is brought forward
hair-raising things will ha open to him. But
though it can bring forward the real, say,
Ferguson, carrying in his hand his unsup-
ported statement that his vote was stolen
from him, it isn’t one chance in 100 that it
can produce the bogus Ferguson who
allegedly stole the vote. That person may be
pawnbroking in Darlinghurst, or wharf-
lumping on the waterside, or importing in
York-street, or driving the Melbourne ex-
press ; or he may have gone to Maoriland,
or retired into hospital and had his appendix
cut out. To bid the complainant find a
person whose one qualification for his job is
his unfindableness is the sort of retort that
leads to nothing. Even if the defendant
tried honestly to bowl himself out by dis-
covering and punishing the individuals
whose swindles are said to have put him in
office, it is difficult to see that he could do
much better.
The bases of the present row are these:
When the first polling day was over at the
recent N.S.W. State elections, the parties
were practically equal so far as concerned
the seats which had been definitely won and
lost. But there were 12 electorates in which
a second ballot was necessary, because there
had been three or more candidates, and no
candidate had secured an absolute majority
of the votes polled. The Wade party was
leading—and sometimes leading by good
majorities—in so many of these shaky dis-
tricts that its opponents, the crowd which
was in office and was in charge of
things, had apparently just three chances
to avoid ruin. The first was to per-
suade a considerable number of the people
who voted Liberal at the first ballot to vote
Labor at the second. This apparently wasn’t
done, for the Wade vote showed very little
alteration one way or the other. As a rule
it seemed that the supporters of Liberal No.
2 simply transferred their votes to Liberal
No. 1. The second resource was to persuade
a'sufficient number of the people who didn’t
vote at the first ballot —a crowd which in-
cluded the dead, the sick, the temporarily
absent, the permanently removed, the lazy
and the indifferent —to vote Labor at the
second ballot. The third possibility was to
personate sufficient of these convenient
people by means of bogus voters. The
Government party won handsomely. It was
either a remarkable case of persuasion or a
remarkable case of the other thing.
It seems highly improbable that the Labor
organisation missed all these possible votes
at the first ballot. It seems equally im-
probable that so many people could be con-
verted to the Holman interest in the very
short interval between the two polling days,
considering the unattractive kind of poli-
tician Holman is. At the same time the
fact that so many people stuck to Wade
during the first and second ballots appears
quite wonderful considering the dreary kind
of politician that Wade is. The "whole
business is indefinite and miserable. In the
present condition of the law nothing can
be proved, for the job of tracing a bogus
voter who knows his business is akin to that
of tracking a fly all over Asia. Probably
the best idea would be to return to the simple
old electoral right. That might be forged,
as the bank note is forged, but it would
be a difficult business. For instance, if
Briggs’s electoral right is No. 1267538 it
would be necessary to get a knowledge of
that fact in order to put up a sham Briggs
who could stand inspection. The electoral
right idea is really a system of rigid audit,
and no honest person should object to being
audited.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Wreck at Exeter.
The lamentable railway accident which hap-
pened at Exeter on the night of * ™Jay>
13th, was the worst which Is. S. YVafes has
vet exDerienced. Also it was the worst
which Australia has yet experienced, barring
the Sunshine horror, in \ ictoria, a tew
years ago. The deaths, at time of writing,
number 14, and there may be additions to
the list The injured are numerous, and
probably a great many more people are
injured than the community is aware of, or
the people themselves are aware of. When
a man gets into middle age, and begins to
totter with the preliminary symptoms of
paralysis, he wanders to the den of the
specialist. And the specialist generally asks
him if, at any time in his life, he experi-
enced a great shock —a railway accident, or
something of the sort? Then he looks
down the old corridors of his memoi y,
and recalls that lie was among the
lucky few who climbed out of the luins
without visible injury when the Jones-
borougli express went to wreck against
a belated freight train, loaded with
manure and tombstones, at Briggs s biding,
quite a long while ago. He merely sultered
a little from “Shock,” and Shock has been
waiting for him ever since. There is no
more patient lier-in-wait than good old
Shock. Ivneesitaw, the highly capable
manager of the Sydney tramways (he was
“The Haven” of G. A. Jeffries’s “Hail and
Semaphore” stories), died the other day, at
the age of 53, through having been in two rail-
way accidents in his younger days. He wasn t
damaged, so far as the naked eye could dis-
cover, but the consequences sat on his door-
step and waited for him. The Exeter acci-
dent arose, so far as can be guessed on the
available evidence, in the usual way. The
line was overloaded with traffic, as always
happens when all the trade of a big State
is carried, regardless of distances, to one
city. It was a single line, but then when
everything has to go to one city regardless
of distances, haulage becomes expensive
that economy must be observed. The ponder-
ous old freight train was late, if a thing
which runs according to no definite schedule
can be accused of that sort of thing—but
then who ever heard of a freight train on a
long single line being otherwise? _ It was
poking itself thoughtfully into a siding when
the Temora mail came bursting through a
fog which possibly obscured the signals.
Perhaps the mail shouldn’t have burst so
violently under the circumstances, but trains
have to make an effort to keep time even on
long crowded single lines, else the man in
charge becomes unpopular. Probably there
would never be any accidents if the regula-
tions were observed, but on the other, hand,
it is a question whether, under the circum-
stances, any long distance train would arrive
within gunshot of its due date if all the
regulations were observed to the bitter end.
Nothing can be known with certainty until
the investigation takes place, and sometimes
the public knows a great deal less than it
should know even after the investigation.
Travelling on crowded single lines is a good
deal of a gamble, and the fact that the
gamble turns out so well as it does says a
great deal for the quality of the manage-
ment.
The Party that is Anti-Defence in its
Heart or Innards.
Liberalism suffered its first defeat, in the
Federal Parliament, on the Defence issue.
The facts that Andrew Fisher went
headed for what Liberalism called “Con-
scription,” and for an Australian as opposed
to a hired navy, gave him the Prime Minis-
tership in 1909. Liberalism’s apparently
ingrained hostility to anything in the shape
of genuine Defence promises shortly to bring
about a repetition of the history of five years
back. Millen, unlike his predecessor
Pearce, has no heart for his job. He wouldn’t
be a true Australian Liberal if he had. He
proposes during the coming military year to
effect a saving of £500,000, and, in order to
achieve this, all sorts of things that ought to
be done are going to be left undone. Take the
matter of aviation. The experts who were
imported by the Federal Government last
year, to tell Australia all it needed to know
on the subject of military flying, recom-
mended recently that more aeroplanes and
some hydroplanes should be acquired. It is
to be assumed that these men know their
job. But Millen considers, seemingly, that
he knows it better. Their scheme has been
turned down. The only biplane that is at
present available for instructional purposes
is notoriously unsafe. It refused to carry
General Gordon and its pilot, in any sort of
security, the other day ; and it put the pilot
in peril of his life when he took it up on his
own. The instructors have asked for
another machine, and their request has been
refused. The Government’s parsimonious-
ness in regard to the expenditure of Defence
money hasn’t even the merit of consistency.
The parade ground at Victoria Barracks,
Sydney, was grass covered, and hence admir-
ably suited for the operation of inexperi-
enced horsemen in charge of more or less
green remounts. If a man has to be put off a
horse, grass is one of the things which he
prefers to land on. The other day the
Government, for no discernible reason, tore
up the grass on the parade ground, and sub-
stituted for it asphalt, at a cost of £4OOO.
Incidentally, it has spent £29,000 in S.A. on
barracks which will not be used for years to
come, there being no soldiers available to
inhabit them; a further large sum on
equally superfluous barracks in W.A.;
while enough cash has just been blewed
on a pair of absurdly ornate stair-
cases at the Sydney barracks to fur-
nish an extra aeroplane or so by itself.
The Bulletin advocated, a year ago, the
inauguration of a reformed system of buying
and breaking in remounts. It urged that
the whole business should be put in the hands
of an experienced horse-master —as distin-
guished from an inexperienced soldier. The
equine w r astage that has occurred, of late
years, owing to the incompetents and
butchers who have had charge of Australia’s
remounts, is appalling, also scandalous. It
is a gratifying circumstance that the Cook
Government has made provision for this re-
form on the estimates. Here, too, however,
the blighting niggardliness of an Administra-
tion which disbelieves in the whole theory of
local Defence in its heart of hearts, is observ-
able. The danger in which every Defence
movement, everywhere, stands, arises from
the fact that many of the most vital—and
likewise costly—details in connection with it
are not the sort that bring in the richest
harvest of votes. There are scores of ven-
tures that are more likely to enthuse the
electors than, for example, the purchasing ot
a few flying machines, or the starting ot a
State haras in the Northern Territory. Yet
these are matters of national moment. J-hey
represent, as it were, the paying of the
country’s insurance premium—an unsensa-
tional, even dull, ceremony, and yet a neces-
sary one. One of the reasons why Liberal-
ism is a menace arises from its chronic habit
of dodging the job of paying the nation s
premium.
The Septuagenarian Judge.
Australia borrows a number _of its most
idiotic conventions from Britain, and chief
among them may be placed the superannu-
ated or semi-doddering Judge. There are
valid excuses for the presence of old men m
a dozen different branches of the Civil Ser-
vice. Many a mere clerk, or other mechani-
cal toiler in the great trade of pen and ink,
will clerk or what not as efficiently at <0 as
he ever did at 50 years of age. The quali-
ties which go first with advancing eld are men-
tal alertness; receptivity as regards new
ideas ; the power of concentrating the mind
for lengthy periods on involved problems;
and such physical assets as sight, hearing
and the ability to keep awake during busi-
ness hours. A civil servant, of the cheaper
sort, might be very fairly efficient even
though the eating years had robbed him of
much of the bodily and mental capital with
which he started life. At the worst—even
assuming, that is, that he developed into a
flagrant dodderer —he could never amount to
a public danger. Yet at 65 he is pushed off
his office stool, with the utmost punctuality,
and for ever. The Judge, on the other hand,
is suffered to stay on, apparently, for as long
as he pleases. Consider the ages of a hand-
ful of Australian Judges, whose names have
been taken at random, from a book of refer-
ence: Chief Justice Griffith, of the High
Court, 69; Chief Justice Way (S.A.), 78;
Chief Justice Madden, of Victoria, 70;
Arbitration Judge Heydon (N.S.W.), 69;
D.C.J.’s Docker and Murray (N.S.W.),
72. And there are many others. A Judge,
if he is to administer justice according to the
ideas of his period, must, in a manner of
speaking, belong to that period. Windeyer
scandalised his generation by his ferocity on
the Bench, for the reason that he belonged
intellectually to the chain-gang era. His
methods would not be endured for an hour
by the present generation. Yet in Judge
Docker, who last week sentenced some boys
to 12 months hard labor for stealing a few
sweets, N. S. Wales has one who follows,
however falteringly, in the footsteps of its
great exemplar in the way of mercilessness.
With Judge Docker it is a matter probably
of age. At 72 he cannot appreciate the way
in which such sentences as he is in the habit
of imposing, impress folks who were unborn
in his lusty youth and middle-age —brave
days when the sentencing of half-a-dozen
people to be hanged, and of a score more to
penal servitude for life, were accepted as
matters of course. But this represents only
one aspect of the case against aged Judges.
The Judge is there to weigh the evidence, and
either personally decide on it, out of hand,
or direct a jury in regard to it. In the
case of the average man of TO, and, to be
even more explicit, in the case of the average
Australian Judge of 70 or over, the task is
an impossible one. The septuagenarian
rarely hears as well as he might, and so he is
liable to miss essential details of the evi-
dence ; his brain tires easily, and so he is
liable to let his attention wander, even if he
doesn’t fall peacefully asleeo; the various
physical disabilities under which he is bound
to labor tend to irritate him, and the counsel
who first has the bad luck to annoy nun
suffers for it —or rather the latter’s client
does. In innumerable ways the presence of
the 70-year-older on the Bench tends to
defeat Justice. When one considers how
often Justice takes the full count, with all the
conditions favorable to a fair deal, the un-
wisdom of introducing a hdrseshoe into the
legal glove, so to speak, in the form-of physi-
cal or mental has-beens, becomes painfully
apparent.

The Cat anti Mouse Foolishness.
Thus “0.K.”: —
Sooner or later the ridiculous “Cat and Mouse
Act,” which enables the Pankhuiists, mere et /ille,
to keep their martyrdom in sensational evidence, will
place the British Government in a serious dilemma.
It is exceedingly probable, if not practically certain,
that one or more of the suffragettes will commit a
hanging offence—an offence so unpardonably mur-
derous that anything short of the last dread sentence
of the sorely-befooled Law will be out of the ques-
tion. A learned Judge will have to doom one or
more of the suffragette sistern to death within the
confines of the goal, in order to prevent an infuriated
populace from committing a lynch on the lady, or
ladies. .
And then the condemned party will refuse to take
food, and the voice of unreasoning humanitarianisin
will protest against the cruelty of forcible feeding
(as it successfully protested in the Pankhurst
case), and the gaol doctor will certify that the con-
demned must surely die of starvation and general
collapse unless she, or they, be released under the Cat
and Mouse. In short, any suffragette convicted of
wilful murder on behalf of Votes for Women will be
in the same position of martyrdom as Mrs. P., only
more so. The Law will .not know what the dickens
to do with the fanatical food-rejectress. Suffragette
madness in gaol will then have an even stronger
method in it than has actuated Mrs. Pankhurst up
to date. A condemned suffragette will take particu-
lar care to be never in a fit state for hanging. The
Law will look a bigger Hass than it ever looked
before.
Everybody knows that a party of male blokes, con-
victed of dangerous lawlessness —from window-break-
ing to incendiarism —in . the best of political causes,
couldn’t beat the Law by refusing their tucker
when they were “doin’ a stretch.” The martyrdom
of starvation would be denied to them if they wanted
it. That is how it would have been thought of by
everybody, ere now, if the. Law had stuck to its syringe
when the artfully-hysterical agitatresses were first
protesting against the cruelty of not permitting a
Pankhurst to starve herself to death. Had the
Government cynically waited for the public sense of
humor to come to its assistance there would have
been no Cat and Mouse farces at the present time.
Why was not the awful indignity and inhumanity
of forcible feeding treated as a joke by those fat-
headed authorities who continue to inflict the cat-o -
nine-tails upon unwilling prisoners? The punish-
ment at the triangles is twice cursed. It degradeth
him that gives and him that takes. But forcible
feeding is a humane act performed under medical
advice, and the only person who suffers indignity
thereby is the Pankhurst who invites it. She puts
herself on all fours with the drunk and disorderly
female that refuses to go quietly in a cab to the
watchhouse, and has to be spreadeagled into the
vehicle. Had the Government calmly and smilingly
presented this view of the matter to public intelli-
gence, Mrs. Pankhurst would months ago have been
buried morally, or physically, or both, under a heap
of forgotten ridicule.
Now that the mischief is done the Law shows
some disposition to bring the humor of indignity to
bear upon suffragettek**i. We hear of Sylvia Pank-
hurst being taken to prison on a butcher’s cart like
a sweetbread or a pound of chops, and of her in-
domitable mother being “grabbed” by the police
and “bundled” into captivity. But we have not yet
heard of a PANKHURST-ian meeting being extinguished
by the local fire brigade.
Dishonesty Made Easy.
A racecourse happening of last week goes
to show that the bookmaking system is liable
to work both ways, as a swindle —it may
be employed equally to welsh him that lays
and him that takes the odds. An owner in-
troduced to N. S. Wales a few days back —
and for the first time locally, so far as the
writer knows —a simple yet reliable old
ramp that has been doing service in England
for decades. He entered a horse at a small
country meeting. All and sundry were in-
formed on the course that the animal was
only out for a pipe-opener. Furthermore,
the owner and his friends backed another
horse in the same race, with just sufficient
ostentation to enable the pathetically gullible
“heads” of the district to find out what they
were doing. Meanwhile in Sydney, New-
castle, Bathurst, Orange, Armidale, Dubbo
and about 27 other places, their agents were
piling money on the alleged “dead-un” at
starting-price odds. So successful were the
manoeuvres of the conspirators on the course
that the starting-price turned out to be
four to one. At this figure the steed rolled
home an easy winner. Unutterable grief
and annoyance surged through the tents of
Israel, when the inhabitants realised the
dastardly stroke that had been put across
them. There was nothing to be done how-
ever, but pay up and decide to take it out
of the ordinary punter’s hide at the earliest
opportunity. Of course, under the book-
making system, it is always the ordinary or
fairly honest punter who pays in the end.
The writer watched this process in operation
only a week or so back. A trainer unearthed
a sort of third-rate champion—the class of
animal that is bound to win in poor com-
pany. He was permitted to try for the first
time at, say, Newcastle. He won. well
backed by the stable, at all sorts of figures
from 10 to one down to level money. His
next appearance was at a Sydney' suburban
course. On this occasion, the being
unsatisfactory, he was “dead” or “stiff.”
The unhappv public, recalling his original
effort, clamored to be allowed to back him.
He finished in the ruck, and repeated the
performance a fortniglit latei, . when he
carried a further wad of public money.
When he tries again the ordinary punter will
have grown weary of him, and the stable
will have the business to itself. The
Tote acts as an effective block on this
variety of criminality. Its institution
in N. S. Wales and Victoria must
sweep away, at one stroke, all such
abuses as starting-price swindles, stiffened
horses, trainers and jockeys, and a dozen
other similar conspiracies that are inevitable
wherever bookmaking prevails. It is the duty
of every Government to minimise the crim-
inal’s opportunities, as regards his chosen
profession, as much as possible; also to try
to protect the idiot from the consequences
of his folly. Both are reasons why
the Administration in N. S. Wales and v ic-
toria should not palter any longer with the
business of introducing the mechanical layer
and taker of odds —the bookie that can’t talk,
and has no cash available for purposes of
bribery and corruption.
-Nfc* * —
The Bulletin received (13/3/T4), the
statement of receipts and expenditure in cau-
nection with the Actors’ Day fSte, which
occurred at the White City ( Sydney) last
month. The actor never was a business
man, and the statement which the Actors
Association has just issued demonstrates the
truth of the old axiom yet again. The ad-
mirable object which inspired the inaugura-
tion of Actors’ Day was the amassing of
sufficient funds to keep the wolf of necessity
from the doors of indigent Romeos, aged and
stone-broke Juliets, and so forth. With
that end in view the organisers of the fund
went to the White City people and said, as
one philanthropist to another, “Will you
help?” or words to that effect. The follow-
ing arrangement was subsequently made. The
actors were to have the use of the White
City. Or, to put it otherwise, they were
to be allowed to attract the public to the
White City by masquerading there as fortune-
tellers, Aunt Sallies, auctioneers and the
like. The White City was to supply, in re-
turn, as much of its usual show as there
was room for, together with a few overtime
hands and bandsmen ; and charge half-a-crown
per head gate money, instead of its customary
6d. Of this sum, 50 per cent, was to go to
the hard-toiling Actors’ Association,
other 50 per cent, to the White City. In
other words, for every human unit that was
attracted to the White City by the Actors
Day revels, the shareholders of the said City
were to snare Is. 3d. —2| times as much as
they would have acquired had the Actors
gone elsewhere. And the White City was
to get the same sort of boom as though it
had done the whole thing in the name of
Charity. The whole scheme turned out splen-
didly—for the City. The total gate receipts
came to £G2B 4s. 6d„ and of this sum the
White City took half. The public was as
much edified at the City’s charitable conduct
in granting its hospitality to the actors as it
ever was when 11. D. Mclntosh (say)
handed the adjacent Stadium over to some
money-raising organisation, and not only
charged nothing for the same, and took not
one farthing of the receipts, but threw in the
cost of the band, lights and service free.
Also the City got a splendid gratis advt. In
fact, the Cicy scored all round. When the
Actors come to contrast the bargain that they
might have made with the White City
people, with the bargain which they actually
did make, the odds are that they will take
themselves privilv aside and project at them-
selves the dead vegetables of utter contempt.
The smash at Exeter last week is a declara-
tion that the N.S.W. railway machine is no
longer working smoothly. The thing is get-
ting out of hand. The question is why?
Till that reason is discovered and removed,
accidents will continue. The position at
Exeter is simple enough. The signalman
knew that he had given “clear line” to a
goods train approaching from one •direction.
He also knew that he had given “clear line”
to the Temora mail approaching from the
other direction, and that they had to cross at
Exeter. The goods is supposed to keep out
of the way of the mail. It had to be got
into the loop so that the mail could run
through. If the loop was not long enough
part of the train would have to be stowed
in the refuge siding. All this takes time.
The mail train had received “clear line” only
to the Exeter distant signal. If the driver
found that signal against him his duty was
to slow down and stop, whistle like the devil,
and then, at about four miles an hour, pro-
ceed to the home signal, or till all his train
was between the distant and the home
signals. And if the home signal still
stuck against him, he had to stop dead and
whistle like 10 devils. Supposing the
statement that the signals were against him
is true, the Temora mail driver did none of
these things, but dashed at high speed into
a station that was closed to him. It has
been said that he had lost himself in the fog,
and went past the signals. But the rail-
way system has provided for that contin-
gency. When he knew he had two trains
approaching, the signalman should have
noticed the state of the fog, and detonators
should have been placed on the rails inside
the distant signals at both ends of the sta-
tion. And that’s just where the trouble
comes in. Does the management keep its sta-
tions properlv supplied with detonators? Does
it keep a sufficient staff at Exeter to work
the traffic safelv, and take proper precautions
in fog-time? If it does, why were the deto-
nators not nut down? Why did the Temora
driver charge right in? These are the only
questions to be answered, and they’re
mighty simple when one comes to look at
them, but writer is prepared to wager a
week’s salary that it will take half a week
of solid cross-examination to get them
answered.
The Budget which the Holman Govern-
ment threw at N.S.W. last week embodied
new taxes to the amount of some £2,000,000
per annum, and the abolition of one old tax
—the impost on absentees, of all things in
the world. There is something abject in
this alleged Labor Government’s regard for
Fat —provided it is extraneous Fat. Some
time ago, when Dacey was Treasurer, it
tried to pass an Income-Tax Bill by which
any little Australian manufacturing com-
pany, which paid union rates, and observed
union conditions, and gave perhaps £oo each
on an average to a group of 10 Australian
shareholders, was to be taxed about twice as
hekvilv as the loafing absentee landlord who
had the same amount all to himself, and
spent his rents abroad. It bludgeoned the
disgracefully Tory measure through the
Assembly, and then it was shamed into a
backdown, and the thing was abandoned.
Apparently, however, the ment- : kink re-
mains. Holman’s excuse for the abolition
of the absentee-tax is that it doesn’t yield
enough to be worth collecting. 11 ell, when
Drought, Prayers, Rain and Gratitude.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Lord, send us rain!” the Farmer cried,
“Ere all my cows and pigs have died !
For very many days and weeks
There’s been no water in the creeks ;
The wells have failed, the springs are dry —
If no rain comes, my stock will die!”
“Lord, send us rain !” the fat Priest prayed,
“My flock are very much dismayed ;
I fear lest they lose faith in. The—
e what is worse, lose faith in ME;
Oh, heed Thy Church’s fervent calif
If no rain comes, its stock will fall.’
“Lord, send us rain !” the Parson moaned;
“Let our backslidings be condoned;
No rain for months have we received,
And my parishioners are grieved
None more so than Fluffstein and
THURN — , 7
If no rain comes, their stock will burn!
“Lord, send us rain !” the Premier wept;
“’Tis many nights since I have slept!
The country’s in a parlous state —
We really can’t afford to wait:
In Thee alone for loans we trust—
If no rain comes, our stock will bust.
The good Lord marked the Farmer’s cry,
And heard the fat Priest’s mournful sigh ;
He hearkened to the Parson’s groan,
And to the Premier’s piteous moan,
And He relented —as before —
And gave the prayers one chance more.
He summoned up the North-West Wind
From Ocean and from Farthest Ind ;
Who from his mighty wings besprent
An agonising Continent,
Whose flocks and herds and hopes had
waned.... . , ■ j
For days it rained —and rained —and rained.
The Lord does nothing (known) by halves..
The Farmer saved his pigs and calves,
But, when he sought the market road,
He swore —the creek had overflowed !
He sourly turned him home again,
And muttered: “Damn and blast the ram.
The Lord does nothing mean and small
The fat Priest got an urgent call; —
A wealthy member of his flock
Who died that night at eight o’clock
The floods were out; unshrived he went,
And never left the Church a cent!
The Lord, through wind and flood and
storm,
On earth great wonders doth perform
The very night the big rain came
It quenched the Tiiurn and Fluffstein
flame: , _ , . „
But did they bless the good Lord s rain/
They never went to church again!
Yet there was left one grateful heart:
The Premier gave a joyful start
When on his roof the monsoon plashed. .
“Thank God!” he said, while thunder
crashed. .
And rain fell fast, and storm-winds blew, —
“We’ll write another IOTJ!”

11. C. Hoyle, who was not long ago made a
member of the N. S. Wales Government,
has not wasted any time in telling the com-
munity what he thinks of it. A week or
two back he hurried out to a R.C. meeting
at Sydney to explain that:—
A well-known Protestant in the city had told
him that he sent Ins daughters to a convent to be
educated because they would know all that they
ought to know, and. at the same time, they would
be protected from what they ought not to know:
they would only know what was good and pure in
womanhood.
Next, Hoyle turned his cold eye of dis-
approval on the people who use the tram
services, and summed them up thus:
I have gone round in trams in the evening—l
will not mention the locality—and three-fourths of
thpir P Tr e ha^„ 8 ' 0t ou , t without being asked to pay
their lares. ihe conductor comes along and says
meekly : “Fares please! ” and passes on. I have
gone from Circular Quay to Darlinghurst and the
passengers have not been asked to pay their fares,
rhe tram was literally packed. [ feel sure we are
losing immense sums annually by this means.
A three-month-old Minister who can crowd
into that period an insinuation that at the
Mate schools girls learn more than is “good
fhl P f Ure ,. in womanhood” and that about
three-fourths , of tlle tram travellers he had
met in special investigatory excursions evade
paymg their tares—are thieves, in short—
is fairly sudden.

It was a kindly thought of Hugh Buckler
to revive the “celebrated” comedy,
Garrick,” at his Little Theatre, in Sydney.
YVe are so accustomed to the modern drama,
with all its perfections and imperfections
thick upon it, that we do not remember how
bad the old drama was. “David Garrick”
provides the awful example. It lias all the
faults and all the theatricalities from which
the modern drama, say in the hands of
merely a skilled craftsman like Pinero, has
triumphantly emancipated itself. “David
Garrick opens with three characters occupy-
ing the stage in turn, and each, as soon as
left alone, seizes the opportunity to indulge
in long soliloquy. Then the script is pep-
pered with the forgotten stage direction
(aside), lhe construction is clumsy. At the
end of what is, in this version, the third act,
a totally unnecessary and unconvincing duel
is announced in order to carry on the action
into an unnecessary fourth act. The humor
is of the most banal knock-about kind. As
an example of the sort of stuff that was good
enough for our fathers, and the sort of play
that made Tom Robertson famous, “David
•Garrick” is typical. Hugh Buckler has
discovered, what was painfully obvious to
the first-night audience at the Little Theatre,
that ‘David Garrick” is too short to fill a
full evening’s bill. Seventy minutes of drama
per evening isn’t a fair thing. Two of the
intervals on that night were longer than the
acts that followed. In London recently all
that is essential in “David Garrick” was
dones in 30 minutes. Now, however, Louis
N. Parker’s theatrical one-act play, “The
Man in the Street,” has been added to the
bill of fare.

“The Sacrifice,” a playlet by J. C. Wilson,

Sydney Tivoli on Saturday. The whole thing
is very well done, particularly by Styan, but
as a subject it contains little about the

From the picture shows’ Intelligence
Department (Sydney branch) :
Crystal Palace: “Daniel in the Lions’ Den,” a
revival of the most entertaining wild-animal turn in
history. Also, an exact reproduction of the pleasant
five minutes three Children of Israel spent in a fur-
nace.
Lyric : “The Mistake of Her Life,” wherein there
is no mention of the lady who aimed a worm at
Lloyd George, hit a curate, and got 24 hours.
Colonial: “The Shadow of Guilt,” in which a
partially-roasted millionaire is rescued from a burn-
ing building. (The printer will doubtless make this
read “burning bulldog.”) Said that Charles Lamb
was passing at the time, and went home and wrote
that yarn about the roast pig.
Empress: “The Question of Right,” which has
been worrying the City Council for a considerable
time.
Lyceum: “The Harper Mystery,” being the first
oi a series of shemale detective yarns.
West's Glaciarium and Olyi&pia : “The Black
Gang, something out of the ordinary in the way
of bandit-gang thrills.
The Land of Nod,” at Sydney Palace,
winch appears to hold the same place in the
theatrical world as the platypus does in
the realm of natural history, inasmuch as it
is a little of everything, is still an un-
dimmed dream. The Palace stage is a
ciamped place, and it takes a company
accustomed to more room in which to swing
its leg some time to get accustomed to these
narrow quarters. When beautiful damsels
are called upon to swing a quart of alluring
extremity in a pint and a half of accommo-
dation, the struggle becomes strenuous. But
the company is now accustomed to its lim-
ited space and has discovered that the beau-
tiful ways of displaying an alluring leg are
infinite. So the changes are rung with
charming reiteration, and the crowd that
loves to see beautiful girls at their best, and
hates to have to think with its pleasure,
should note the fact. So far there is no word
of change, but intending patrons should seize
time by the collar lest they miss the ’bus.

is the custom to bestow souvenirs on ladies
only. Bazaar managements being feminine,

ess gets a bouquet or something as a me-
mento of the opening of the show. Woman,
in any case, wants whatever is being given
away gratis, and both sexes have agreed to
recognise her weakness in this respect until
she comes into full possession of her rights.
Then it will be time to present every gentle-
man in the audience with half an ounce of

titled “Come Over Here” will occur on the
28th.

At the Rickards’ Melbourne Tivoli the
Tom Davis Trio of mid-air motorists were
due on Monday last, the old impolitic sys-
tem of bringing all new turns to light on
Saturdays having been somewhat departed
from. Five Merry Youngsters are the next-
to-newest turn just now. Two or three
members of the quintette seem to have grown
a good deal since they started to be juveniles,
and their performance for the most part is
feebly Hoboeic and familiarly ’Murkan.

barrel jumper are still there,_ also Josephine
Davis, whose latest costume is prettier than
her latest song. But Talleur Andrews is

Good talent gets a poor financial return
in the dramatic and musical entertainment
given by Marcus St. John and Irma Caron.
They had a small house for their opening
at Melb. Athenaeum Hall on a horribly hot
night last week. Apart from the weather
the combination of ultra-decorative names
was probably against them. The beautiful
names invited a suspicion that was ground-
less. Marcus St. John’s monologue render-
ing of Stephen Leacock’s “Behind the
Beyond” is well done. Leacock’s satire on
a so-called modern problem play is not
nearly so subtle as the performer seems t<
think it. All the same, the “skit” is humor
ous, and his acting of the characters and
descriptive by-play is consistently droll.
Irma Caron (the young daughter of the
late Leon) sings between the acts, and
throws in a violin solo. As a dramatic
soprano the clever little lady is an interest-
ing exponent of half-finished art. Her ring-
ing voice has been hardened where it needed
a little more sweetening, and her gestures
need further tuition, but she has the tem-
perament for a prima donna, and would be a
more satisfactory Carmen than any member
of the present Quinlan Co. Two extra per-
formances will be given on Thursday and
Saturday this week.

The most noticeable point about “The

“Jean Sibi” sends some more Melbourne
art: —
Artist Clara Southern is the latest to be found on
the premises of the Melbourne Athenaeum with intent
to commit a masterpiece. None of her pictures
achieve great distinction, but they have a pleasing,
homely flavor, and are so crowded with fowls that
one suspects she is a poultry-breeder in disguise.
“Speckles” is a nice fowl subject, and the presence
of yellow chooks in “The Old Stable” adds an attrac-
tive color-note to the depressing interior. “The
Fodder Patch,” priced at 75 guineas, is a large
color chant in green variations, while “A Legacy to
the Bush” is an inoffensive record of an aged
humpy with a magpie brooding on the battered
chimney. Time and the weather have eaten holes in
all the bush mansions that Clara depicts, and she
shows her leaning for ruin and decay by illustrating
unkempt gardens and moribund trees. A group of
kookaburras holding service on a water tub is the
most cheerful contribution in the show. Miss South-
ern’s one big gum canvas is labelled “Aristocrats,”
though her art isn’t strong enough to raise the tim-
ber to the peerage.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Henry Horsecollar”: Mrs. Potiphar of Egypt is
a lady of whom we know very little, and what little
we do know is supplied by Hebrew authorities who
were bound to make out the best possible case for
their countryman, Joseph the Vizier. I beg to
recommend as a fitting subject for Biblical drama
another character of whom we know still less —
namely Blastus, the King’s Chamberlain. He appears
just once in the Scripture, yet in two lines we
gather that he took bribes in return for his influ-
ence with the king; that he was honest enough, or
wise enough, to do the service for which he took
the bribes; and that he had sufficient pull to be
able to deliver the goods. I picture Blastus as a
tall, stout, handsome man of about 50. He had
courage and brains and tact —the man who would be
bear-leader to a Herod required all these qualities.
His wife —he had married very early—was hard and
energetic and clever and good-looking. She had
some money and some family influence, and young,
ambitious Blastus saw in her a woman who could
give him a shove, while she recognised in him a

man who could give her a lift. So they wedded,
and lived together in a polite sort of way, and were
fairly, happy. The three sons were already in the
public service when Blastus made his one Biblical
appearance, and they promised well. These things
Blastus had impressed on them when they were
young: to be courteous, to be silent, not to commit
themselves in writing, to make the accounts look
straight whether they were or not, and always to
invite the auditor to dinner. The daughter, who was
a replica of her mother, wore a split skirt, and was
married to a promising young officer with influence and
a good scent for plunder. Blastus had possessed an
elder brother of little account. At the age of 22
'"Blastus was then 20) he disappeared, the inheri-
tance not being enough for two. It was the one
crude act in a long and diplomatic career, but
everybody is crude to begin with. The King’s Cham-
berlain died at the age of 60, and all the best
families expressed their regret. There were many
rich chariots at his funeral. People also said
that for a man who had never been found out or even
seriously suspected, the fortune he left was simply
incredible. The Government was half-inclined to
overhaul his papers to find out how much of the
pile really belonged to the Treasury, but he hadn’t
left any papers.
“Monkbarns”: “OK.” ((26/2/’l4) touches on
Blondin. On a special night, during the run of a
Melbourne Opera House pantomime, under Lvster’s
management, he carried Edward Farley, attired as a
comic monarch, up from stage to gallery. This
looked risky enough for the crowded stalls and pit.
However, the house kept cool, and Blondin didn’t
drop Farley in its lap. Blondin was nearest a fall
in the Sydenham Crystal Palace, at an appalling
height. Something went wrong with the rope. He
used to wheel a lion cub across, and even a small
lion is bad company at a pinch. There used to be a
yarn about a man who followed Blondin round the
world in expectation of a drop. This story has been
told of many performers of risky feats. I haven’t
“the Wandering Jew” by me, but didn’t Eugene Sue
tell of a baleful and green-eyed Englishman who
haunted Morok, the lion-tamer ? And there is a
wicked tale of a man who always sat in the front
row of the stalls eating a lemon because the famous
flautist wouldn’t let him marry his daughter. At
every place Blondin carried a man across. When
nobody else would go, his agent, Harry Lyons, had
to take the job. Harry used to say this was the
cross of his life, in every sense. He was more
frightened every time.
Stanley, the new Vic. Governor, was reported
in the Argus, as saying that “He could not claim
any acquaintance with dramatic art, but his children
could claim descent from a family not unknown in
British dramatic history. While he had no relation-
ship with Kendall his children would have that
direct connection and relationship.” From which
one presumes that Mrs. Stanley is a direct descendant
of John Kemble or his sister Sarah Siddons. The
Gov.’s diction is somewhat cloudy, or a somewhat
deaf reporter had never heard of the Kembles, any-
how. So he concluded that his Ex.’s offspring claimed
descent from Mrs. Kendall, the still surviving “Mother
of the British drama.” The Argus indiscretion would
make out the Stanley lady to be related to Dorothy
Grimston (Mrs. Kendall’s daughter), late of Mel-
bourne divorce court.
London Referee has been clearing up the
old mystery of how “Queen of My Heart” got
dropped into “Dorothy.” On the evidence of Hayden
Coffin and others concerned, the facts seem to be:
(1) “Dorothy” was produced in London while com-
poser Cellier was away in Australia; (2) Coffin want-
ing another song, the music firm of Chappell’s dug
up an “Old Dreams,” which they had bought from
Cellier some time before, and B. C. Stephenson,
author of the play, wrote “at rehearsal” the lament-
able “Queen of My Heart” lines, which now stand
to the song; (3) Cellier, on returning, was furious,
and said almost a whole dictionary in his excitement.
“Chasuble” (a confused yarn with many capitals) :
A dark little beardy man named Ruth succeeds Pastor
Spurr in the Melbourne Collins-street Baptist Church.
If he were the Angel Gabriel, or the golden-mouthed
Chrysostom, he could not possibly come within Seven
League boots of Spurr. In Gil Bias there is the
popular mimic who imitates a pig squeaking under
his cloak. An imitator is hooted and booted.
“Why, you fools,” exclaims he, “This is a Real
Pig!” And he produces it. Kemble found himself
distanced in York by Cummins. Kean would not
be endured in the East End after Cobham and
Brayvo ’lcks. Waller is not a patch on Julius as
Beaucaire. Here’s the temper of the Collins-street
Baptists. They have been savaged. Now Spurr’s
in London, I will say he is a ninny. Like the
patient who wrote over his Hospital bed, “I was
well. I wanted to be better, and here I am.” Spurr|s
tape-measurement of the occiput increased. His
thought was (and he virtually said it), “To be sure
I am at the top of the Melbourne tree. The glass of
pulpit fashion. It only argues that I must not
waste my prime here, but hasten to London, and
Spurr burgeons into Spurgeon.” Mistake! Mistake!
The Village is bigger than he reckons. Only one
Spurr in barbarous Melbourne, but they are plentiful
as blackberries amid the Seven Millions. He will be
like Esau, not finding a place of penitence, though
seeking it with tears, and much hair.
“C. Ockney”: Re that par. (B. 12/3/’l4), on the
heroic boosting of perishing plays in London. The
Daily Herald rushed in a kindly spirit to the rescue
of “The Fortune Hunter” the other day. In passion-
ate terms it exhorted all playgoers worthy the name to
plank down their money and see the piece. However,
“The Fortune Hunter” had been taken off two nights
before the article appeared. Play-boosting is one of
those sports in which it is absolutely essential to get
in before the death.
“Haresfoot” : “David Garrick” is little more than a
translation by Tom Robertson from a French play
called “Sullivan.” The author of that fancied Barry
Sullivan to be a by-gone character, though he was
then acting. Robertson was hard up (that was before
he made his hit with “Society”) when “David Gar-
rick” chimed in with Sothern’s desire to get out of
the everlasting Dundreary. The play was first acted
in Australia by Lingard. Knight has done it, with
dainty Unie Russell (Mrs. Chia) as Ada Ingot. Fred
Leslie acted Garrick at a matinfie, wanting to escape
the denmition Gaiety grind, where, indeed, his genius
was wasted. Vezin' acted a one-act version, called
“Doctor Davy.” However, the foremost Garrick has
been Wyndham, with Mary Moore (Widow Albery) as
Ada. They acted the piece at Berlin in German.
Edwin Booth was rapturously welcomed as Hamlet
in Berlin. Yet he had to speak English, while all
the other performers spoke German. It did not seem
to matter. Rossi acted Hamlet and Romeo throughout
America in Italian, with an English-speaking com-
pany, and that succeeded, too. Salvini acted Othello
in Italian, with Booth’s lago in English. Bandmann
insisted on a polyglot he called English. Nay, he
was Rob Roy in Glasgow! “My food’s upon my
native he-ed, my name’s Makrekka !” shouted Daniel,
and the audience shouted also. I don’t mean that it
paid for the drinks.
A good run of “The Fortune Hunter” in London
is made the excuse for a change in prices; the
Yankee Hale Hamilton, producer and hero of the
play, has dropped the entrance-money for the fatted
ox in the stalls from a half-guinea to seven-and-six —
with sixpence extra for a programme. “The middle-
classes make the theatre,” says Hamilton in his defence,
and with seven-and-sixpenny stalls a man can “take
his wife to the theatre and almost manage supper”
out of the sovereign which he reckons is as much
as the middle-class man can afford for one evening's
spree.
Nena Lucas, whose pa is proprietor of various
Melbourne foodries, including the Paris and the
Vienna, has taken to the stage. She is the lithe
young female who performs a serpentine dance before
Pharaoh, in the third act of “Joseph and His
Brethren.” Another well-known local girl who is
“walking on” in “Joseph” is Leah Halinbourg, who
has been prominent in Repertory Theatre productions.
Something very French and candid in drama is
promised at Melbourne Royal for the 28th when the
“Within the Law” co. returns to town. “Madame
X,” translated from the French of Alex Bisson, holds
the mirror up to woman’s frailty, and shows bludger-
ism its own image. The getting of the audience’s
sympathy for the married woman who goes to the
deuce is Muriel Starr’s job.
“0.K.”. The mystery of Dolly Harmer’s Voice is
explained. When Dolly warbles of her introduction
to the parents of Percy, who had picked her up in
the park, she sounds like guns going off. The noise-
of one crying “Fish 0” in the wilderness is sotto
voce as compared with the roar of “Percy’s Mother,”
or “Percy’s Father” issuing from the lips of Miss
Harmer in the Williamson panto. Her abnormal
tones are due, it seems, to her having been dumb for
a whole year. For 12 months she couldn’t speak at
all. She had to express her thoughts by gestures
and writing on a slate. Then her lost voice returned
as suddenly as it had left her, with interest added
for the period during which it was dead to the
world. And now the lady is dissipating her accu-
mulation of sound in the song about Percy’s rela-
tives and the dog that went “bow-wow” on the mat.
“S.T.S.”: “There are lots of people to-day to
whom ‘Just Before the Battle, Mother,’ would come
as a novelty” (B. 20/l/’l4). There ARE. At a
garden party lately I was talking to a really musical
girl. She admired the air the band was
playing, and wondered what it was. “That?”
I said, “See, He Slumbers How Serenely.”
A politely blank gaze. “Out of ‘Maritana’—
same piece as ‘Let Me Like a Soldier Fall.’ ”
No good. The names of Wallace and “Maritana”
conveyed nothing whatever to her. Yet everything
modern, from Tschaikowsky to Irving Berlin, she
had at her finger-tips. We are too apt to think
that the tunes (or books, or manners, or pipes, or
collars) we were brought up on will be popular for
ever. They won’t. The young don’t care a hang
about them, any more than all the hangs we didn’t
care about those of the generation before. These
old-song revivals are merely festivals for the middle-
aged.
“Haresfoot”: The second part of “Faust” is being
acted with success in German theatres, and will find
its way to London, N’York and Australia. It is the
most extraordinary spectacle ever tumbled on the
boards. Everyone is familiar with the first part,
ending in Margaret being wafted by angels to
Heaven. When Mephisto says to Faust: “Hither
with me!” it doesn’t mean descending into Hades
with a pouf of red fire. No, they are off for more
adventure. At the Court of the impecunious German
Emperor, Faust, under Mephisto’s impulse, becomes
the Grand Financier, and there is a boom. Then
he gets up a masque, which includes all the wonders
of Christmas pantomime. Faust wrests Helena from
Menelaus, and they have a son, Euphorion. He goes
up on a celestial aeroplane, but comes to smash.
Faust is next the eminent generalissimo. Still that
does not satisfy him. He wants to be a General
Booth, and reclaim the Zuyder Zee. But Mephisto
says “Time’s up,” and flames burst out. Mephisto
urges the demons to grab him, but angels pelt them
off with roses, and Faust ascends to Heaven a la
Margaret, and you are left wondering if he wouldn’t
have found much more congenial^company if he had
taken the other turning.
“Vagabond” (from London) : I took in the show
at the Coliseum —one of the biggest and best of
London halls—the other night specially to see the
“Wild Australia” turn. The Wild Australians wore
red shirts mostly, and, barring a man who cracked a
stockwhip and flicked a cigarette from a boy s hand,
and a boxing kangaroo, the show was as wild as the
Strand on Sunday, and as Australian as Caractacus.
A girl yanked yards of torpid snakes out of boxes.
They were announced as “strong enough to crush an
ox,” though from the look of them they didn’t look
strong enough to inconvenience a poached egg. The
girl festooned them round her and posed, and that
was all. Another girl, dressed in the fringed hunt-
ing shirt which cowboy moving pictures have made
so familiar, is “the greatest shot, not only in Aus-
tralia, but in the world.” She potted white balls,
apparently about 2in. across, and set against a
blackboard, from a distance of about 6ft. She could
nearly have swiped the balls off with the butt-end of
a gun. Three woodchoppers gave an exhibition of
log-chopping which made the edge of the axe turn
in disgust. The worst chopper had his gash away
m the audience, but I could see the lovely fretsaw
work on the edge of his ragged cut. The bunch of
them in an average outback “chop” would be set to
split chins for firewood. The bills had promised
buck-jumping amongst the other “Fun of the Stock-
ade” (the “Stockade,” by the way, consisted of two
lots of three hurdles, placed to form a triangle and
containing respectively one donkey and one emu, both
looking sad). The buckjumping consisted of the
donkey flinging a string of boys, raked in off the
streets,' one by one as fast as they could be mounted.
He shifted each one with a single contemptuous
hitch of his hindquarters. Then a horse did likewise
with a squad of grown-up volunteer street-arabs. The
event was the Wild ’un, who trotted a buekjumper
twice round the stage. It bucked almost enough to
earn a job as a station hack. A brass band dressed
in red shirts and jack-boots marched on the stage
when the curtain rose, and after each item burst
forth in a weird wail that sounded something like
the wind in a knothole, and was meant to be a
coo-ee. It mostly fainted about the fourth row of
stalls, and the surviving remnant staggered on in a
thin squeak that would have disgraced a muzzled
mouse. Wild Australians! But there was one wild
Australian in the house that night. He was holding
down my tip-up seat.
The parting knell of the Tango is sounded bv
James Douglas, who writes: “New York tangoed itself
stiff a year ago, and now even London is ready for
some fresh thrill. The dear duchesses are slaying
the slain, for the Tango is too difficult to be dia-
bolical. too nondescript to be naughty. .. .The real
objection to the Tango is that it is too dreary to
be indecorous. For that reason the prudes who
desire to put down dancing ought to support the
Tango, for no other dance can clear the floor so
quickly at a ball. Not long ago I saw about 200
people merrily dancing the waltz and the one-step.
The band struck up a Tango, and three crippled
couples took the floor. They crawled round as though
their feet were frost-bitten, and they were treading
on worms. They looked as though they didn’t want
to do it, and were feeling very bad. It was certainly
not the brand of dancing that I would die for. . . .
Many a curate has gone to the Devil with a croquet
mallet in his hand, but I defy the most croquettish
curate to tango to the bad. If you desire something
really risky, I advise you to stand with your best
girl on a broken wall and be a housebreaker.”
“Henry Ilorsecollar” : The case of Charles
Bailey, the medium, with his “apports,” re-
calls an old book that is worth another read-
ing. An “apport” is some article which the
spirits are understood to have shot miracu-
lously over a great distance in an imper-
ceptible space of time, as a guarantee of
good faith. It is always small enough to be
hidden about the medium’s clothes —the de-
mand for an elephant or a ship has never
been responded to. And it is always some-
thing that bears no date, such as a bird’s
nest or a scrap of an old tombstone. So
in the end the medium’s word has to be
taken for it all. The cry of the unbeliever
is that the spirits should present, say in
London, the Bombay or Moscow or Mel-
bourne or San Francisco paper of that same
day, whereupon the spirits have sulked in
their tents and sent no paper along. This
is where the old book comes in. When the
late Walter Besant wrote “Herr Paulus”
his hero made a plausible pretence at the
long-expected marvel, and the writer gave a
moderately convincing explanation of how he
did it. Paulus burst up in the end, but he
didn’t burst so ignominiously as most me-
diums. The novel is cordially recommended
to all scoundrels, thieves, liars, frauds,
shams and impostors in the ghost-raising line
of industry, also to bogus Witches of Endor,
and those in general who pursue the higher
branches of the profession. For there really
are higher and lower branches in the busi-
ness —gradations of dignity such as exist
between a briefless barrister who is drunk
and a dishonest solicitor who isn’t sober.
But Besant’s work would be of no value to
the mere “bob” pretender who sits at a table
with her eyes closed and says in a hollow
voice that little Johnny is quite happy in
Heaven, and that Aunt Sarah hopes to meet
Jane in a better world. She wouldn’t even
begin to understand it.
A Melbourne man was arrested the other
Sunday morning early—l a.m, to be precise
—whilst in the act of carrying his wife home
on his back, as a butcher carries a sheep.
And he was fined 20s. for assault. A lot of
wives would take their unwilling husbands
home that way if they could, instead of pull-
ing, coaxing or pushing ’em, and the ladies
wouldn’t be fined for assault. But the man-
made Law persists in maintaining the in-
equality of the sexes. The bloke who carries
his wife, carcasewise, except for purposes of
rescue from a dangerous predicament is re-
garded as a brute, and punished accordingly.
The W.P.L. might make a note of this case.

SOCIETY
PENFOLD'S
WINES
“Bind”: There is nothing new. On a
recent hot afternoon, when the milk had gone
bad and there Avas a fly on the meat,
the cable announced that “a stir had
been made by Chicago’s latest effort to bring
a criminal to justice.” The message Avent
on: —
The police authorities have taken a photograph of
the eye of a girl who was recently clubbed to death
at St. Nicholas’s Cemetery.
Oculists assert that, the retina of the gill’s eye
will probably show the picture of the man who
committed the crime if he were visible to the girl
before she became unconscious.
This is a very old device. Twenty years
ago an extremely able short story Avriter,
who veiled his identity under the pen-name
“X.Y.Z.,” contributed a yarn to the Nine-
teenth Century, which was based on the
same idea. In “X.Y.Z.’s” story the detectiA’e
stood on the guillotine, close beside a doomed
criminal, and talked to him incessantly about
a murder of which he suspected the latter.
The detective was still talking Avhen the
knife fell. Seizing the head he hurried away
with it, and on the retina of the eye found a
photograph of the scene of blood, by means
of which he was enabled to clear an inno-
cent man of an accusation of murder, find
the missing will, restore the lost child to its
mother and adjust matters equitably all
round. I don’t know if “X.Y.Z.” had any
scientific backing for his theory. From the
fact that his other yarns (they were pub-
lished in book form under the heading
“Aut Diabolus Aut Nihil”) dealt with such
subjects as the raising of the Devil in a
Parisian flat and the appearance of a super-
naturally-gifted descendant of Judas Iscariot
in modern Constantinople, I should be in-
clined to think not.
“F.C.” writes: —
An old acquaintance of The Bulletin’s, one
Pelianegay Don Hendrik, turned up after a lapse of
much time in the' P’ran (Vic.) Court lately on a
charge of palmistry. It appeared that he had been
visited by an alleged Highlander named Donald
Gillies and a seeming Dago, who called himself
Antonio Boulizo. After he had told their fortunes
they arrested him—for, as. you will have already
diagnosed, gentle reader, they were cops. The State
got £25 out of Pehan, etc., but that is about all
there Avas to it. The impost won’t stop his fortune-
telling. And, anyhow, there are worse offences. The
community has to set against its £25, (1) Loss of
time, as regards two of its servants, occasioned by
their getting into fancy dress; rehearsing their parts
as Scot and Dago respectively ; and playing the same
to the undoing of Pehan, etc. (2) Probable loss of indi-
vidual sums of cash, portions of personal property and
so forth, due to the prolonged absence of the John
Dunns from their customary haunts. (3) Loss of
prestige on the part of the entire force, in the eyes
of the burgling community—assuming, that is, that
the Vic. force enjoys any prestige in the eyes of the
local burglars. The loss of prestige is the inevitable
outcome of the police associating themselves with
such foolishness as the above; and the menace of it
is that it is calculated to make the Vic. malefactor
more daring. A really daring malefactor is, notori-
ously, an unpleasantness in the home. A number of
other objections might be cited, but this paper’s
space won’t run to it. To sum-up, the harrying of
fortune-tellers, at a vast expense of time and money,
isn’t worth it, Avhen the fact is taken into, considera-
tion that there are herds of really dangerous crimi-
nals in Victoria who don’t seem to be harried worth
a cent.

Iconoclasm from “J.R.” :
Why does the Professor of Greek at Sydney Uni-
vers?ty c,am °r f °r the appointment of a Professor of
Ancient History? The present Professor of Modern
History might very well combine the two jobs and
blossom forth as Professor of History. I am aware
that the move would constitute an innovation, that
it isn’t done elsewhere, and so forth. But what
of that? [t is impossible for anyone to say definitely
where ancient history ends and modern history begins.
The p o p U ] ar v j ew , which was the scientific view a
century ago, is that history is a list of names of
kings, the dates of their reigns, and the dates of
battles. It is understood now that kings—barring
a few very unusual specimens—are not of so much
conse q U ence, and that what has always been im-
portant is the gradual progress of man as a reasoning
creature and a tool-, weapon- and fire-using animal
since he first can be shown to have existed on the
earth. History is the story of the progress of man
; slnee he first appeared as man. His advance has
been more or less constant. There have been fluctua-
tions, ag w hen the Spartans destroyed the Athenian
Empire, and, again, after Constantine made Chris-
tianity the state religion of the Roman Empire and
jerked the old Pagan civilisation out of the rut in
which it had been running since the Trojan War, and
perhaps long before. But the immediate change was
not very great for a long time. There was a much
greater change in the Roman world when Octavianus
Caesar assumed the title of Imperator. Did modern
history begin, as some people think, when the Goths
took Rome, and the Western Empire fell? Events
had long been leading up to the result, arid it cannot
be said with any truth that the taking of Rome
made such difference to anyone outside the city. All
history, from the very earliest times of which we
have any knowledge to our own day, is a continuous
series of events without any breaks. Everything
new . firew out of something older. The German

CLEARING THE LINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
iffoss Vale, Saturday.—A heavy fog, Avhich
descended upon the country surrounding Exeter last
night was responsible for a frightful collision between
two trains.
The Temora mail Avhich left Sydney at 8.10 p.m.,
crashed Avith terrific force into a goods train in the
loop close to the railway station, completely wreck-
ing both trains and killing 14 passengers, while 18
others were injured.
The wreckage, from the smash littered the line
with heaps of debris, Avhile the sufferings of the un-
fortunate people jammed among the broken Avood-
work AVere frightful.— Press telegram.
Lines!
Clear the lines !
Lift the bodies from the Avreckage, but we’ve got to
clear the lines !
Ev’ry train must go to Sydney, and they’re Avaiting
to get through,
While the injured by the lanterns Avait for doctors.
Ah ! the dew
Gems the blood-splashed rugs and blankets, and the
great wheels creak and Avhine,
As the fog-bound railway Avorkers toil to clear the
littered line.
There’s no pity in the Sy#tem—as the dead with
staring eye,
Mutely lying at attention, seem prepared to testify.
For the pomp and pride of Sydney do they nightly
overload
North and South and West the main-lines till There’s
Something in the Road.
Then Avith human sacrifices is the misty night defiled,
And the hypocrites of Sydney voice their grief in
accents mild,
Asking blandly what devices Avill prevent the gory
smash,
While the map Avith lines converging shows their
brains are mere bran-mash.
See the tentacles that westAvard stretch for half a
thousand miles ;
Trace the thin steel ribbons southAvard where the
rolling coastland smiles;
Then go north right to the border with the branch
lines pouring down
Trade and people—sheep and victims —into greedy
Sydney town.
From the parched, tormented stock train to the
smashed and splashed express,
Ilete is Avounded Reason crying to the stars for some
redfess.
From the pomp and pride of cities —from the glut-
tony that kills
Beasts and people and ambition shall Ave save our
native hills?
Let us open up the Closed Ports till the straight
clear metals shine.
Oh, the mail Avill get through safely Avhen there’s less
upon the line.

“J.G.”: The other day John Madden was
waited on by brother Frank, in all the glory
of a big wig, preceded by a potentate bear-
ing a lump of gilded wood on his shoulder,
and followed by a herd of M’s.L.A. and
M’s.L.C. It appeared that the procession had
turned up to ask John to put his signature
as Acting-Governor to a little Bill that the
State Parliament had passed authorising
someone to pay salaries, etc. Frank ap-
proached John in the approved fashion,
THE BORROWER OF CLOTHES.
THE MISTRESS: “ Mother insists she has seen
you three times in this dress, Susan."
THE MAID: “Oh, no, indeed, madam. I never
wear the same dress twice."
bobbing his head three times and making an
arch of his spine. He said they had ap-
proached his Excellency to ask him to sign
a Bill, so that it might have the punch of an
Act. John bowed impressively and said he
was greatly obliged to Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen of both Houses of Parliament,
and after a glance at the paper, signed his
name in the place marked with a pencilled
cross. Frank then arched his spine some
more, and said they were much obliged to
his Excellency. After which the M’s.P. and
Mr. Speaker backed out and the tremendous
business was , finished. If Frank had
dropped in on John and said, “Here, Jack,
sign this —-it’s a matter of form,” and John
had replied “Righto! where?” would the
whole Parliamentary machine have fallen to
pieces, I wonder.
At time of writing the little town of Yass
(N.S.W.) is suffering from an outbreak of
typhoid. It has been suffering in that way
for some time —in fact, it is always a town
of poor luck. The trouble,, like previous
troubles of the same sort, is charged up to
drought. “What we want,” says a local
doctor, as reported in last Friday’s Sydney
Telegraph, “is rain and good water for the
people to drink.” It is added that business
is entirely suspended” in the dry town.
Even the' hospital is dependent on water
carted from a distance by local volunteers;
but for this aid the patients would presum-
ably die off rapidly. The wonderful Federal
capital of Canberra lies in the triangle
bounded by Cooma, Queanbeyan and Yass.
Among all the meteorological stations within
150 miles of the coast Cooma is the most
permanently drought-stricken, and lias the
lowest rainfall. C ueanbeyan, within 10
miles of Canberra, is the second worst; and
Yass ranks very close up. As regards
Queanbeyan this is the latest:
Queanbeyan, Thursday.—At the monthly meeting
of the Yarrowlumla Shire Council a communication
was received from the Department of Health stating
that samples of water taken from the public school
at Michclago were found to so contaminated with
organic matter as to be unfit for human consumption.
Now, if there isn’t water enough to supply a
decent drink and wash to Yass (population
2243) or Queanbeyan (population 1408),
to say nothing of Cooma (2330), there must
be rather a dry, pestilence-stricken time
ahead for the vast metropolis of all Aus-
tralia which is to lie in between.
Little Mannum, on the Murray to the
east of Adelaide, has suddenly jumped into
notice as a kind of Greenwich for South
Australia. It is only a trifle north of the
city, but this brings it just on the same
parallel of latitude as Buenos Ayres; and,
as the river air is particularly clear, and
David Shearer, of the big machinery-making
firm there, runs a well-equipped observatory
of his own, State Astronomer Dodwell lias
arranged to go over to Mannum at intervals
—it has no railway yet, but people have
been known to get there —and correspond
with Argentina on variation-of-parallels,
whatever they may be and whatever good
they may do. Presumably a parallel is a
good thing to have about the house.
“M.” : The recently-issued Fantome report
on the shoaling off Bradley’s Head, Sydney
Harbor, made many a hardened salt wince or
blaspheme, or behave as the typical salt is
wont to in moments of intense emotion. The
said report arrived months late. By a
supreme bit of red-tapeism Australian sur-
vey reports have to be sent to London before
they are made public in Australia. Can
you beat it? It is as though Bathurst had
to let Sydney know by mule waggon that a
murder was transpiring in its (Bathurst’s)
main street, as a condition preliminary to
wading in and putting a period to the car-
nage. The shoaling off Bradley’s Head is,
by the way, very considerable. At a dis-
tance of 150 yards from the Head the depth
is now 24ft., where a few years back it was
42ft.
“Because it’s an immemorial
custom and gives dignity.” is
the invariable answer hurled at
the occasional Philistine who
wants to know why the insani-
tary old wig should not be
kicked out of the Courts. Even
if the wearing of horsehair
were an immemorial custom,
that would be no reason for
keeping it out of the dust bin.
But, as a fact, it is not three
centuries old. Some passing
idiotic fashion brought it into
general vogue a little over two
centuries ago, but by about the
period of the third George it
was in pretty general disuse
again. Only the clergy and
two or three of the professions
clung to it in a more or less
desultory sort of way. and in a very
short time the most conservative pro-
fession of them all alone donned it.
The Others decided that the ass who would
mistake a wisp of horse feathers for wisdom
wasn’t worth impressing.
Petronius Earbiter speaks :
That organ of light and leading, the Sydney Tele-
graph—the paper that thinks Captain Cook discov-
ered Australia, and that Lloyd George discovered
statesmanship, and that Cobden discovered the Mil-
lennium —has distinguished itself twice in one week
by discovering—or re-discovering—the Assyrians !
Personally, I believe that the D.T. could discover any-
thing it liked, but let that pass—as the brigand who
was giving up business observed to the house-agent.
The way in which the “great” Foreign-trading jour-
nal educates Ma’s public opinion is extremely edify-
ing ; also amusing, surprising and felicitous. The
fact that the Assyrians passed out of human ken
very, very long B.C> —passed out as completely as
the" Hittites, and the Hivites, and the .Tebusites, and
the Etolian League, and the tribe of Ephraim, and
the Piets, and the Carthaginians, and the Samnites —
is to the Sydney Telegraph no more than the fact
that Freetrade passed out 30 years ago. Likewise
the fact that Sydney D.T. Cellar “Liberalism” is
hopelessly dead is no more to the enterprising daily
than the fact that the Rapparees are no more, and
Rebecca’s Daughters have ceased to rage in Wales.
The paper pursues the uneven basso profundo of its
ignorance just the same.
The lamentable railway accident at
Exeter (N.S.W.) happened on Friday, the
13th. Incidentally there are 13 letters in
the name of Commissioner Thomas Johnson.
IMPOSSIBLE, ON THE FACE OF IT.
Residents of East Melbourne having reported thefts of milk in the early morning, the police made a
raid on the “dossers” in the Friendly Societies’ Gardens.
“ What’s he up fori"
“ Stealin' the milk, your Worship."
“The MILK! He's discharged without a stain on his character."
“10-2-4”: Last week someone distributed
several pieces of wood, studded with nails,
across a road leading out of Sydney. _ The
absurd idea of the Automobile Club is that
whoever did it wanted to destroy motor tyres.
But what a work of supererogation when one
recalls the fact that practically every road
around Sydney has been built, seemingly,
with the deliberate object of destroying tyres !
Who wants to waste money on boards and
nails and things with the Parramatta-road or
Upheaval available ; and likewise the scenic
disturbances which lead to Botany and La
A RISING MARKET.
“Yes, I'll settle £500 a year on my wife when
I marry."
“ Reggie, you're letting yourself go too cheap.
It's worth a thousand."
Perouse and Manly and so forth? The
Automobile Club is alleged to be pursuing
the proprietor of the boards and nails with
an axe. A better scheme, meseems, would be
to round up a couple of dozen suburban aider-
men and deal with them. Nothing would
appeal more powerfully to the writer than to
participate in a sort of pogrom of suburban
aldermen —preferably mayors. Once let
him (the scribe) get his fingers into the
weazand of the sort of mayor who is re-
sponsible for the sort of road that lies
(say) on the Sydney side of Ryde station,
and he won’t mind if it rains ink.
‘‘Carmine”:
Nearly 300 paint-
ings are in the
vaults of the Na-
tional Gallery, Mel-
bourne, with their
faces turned to the
wall. They cost
about £19,000; one
alone ran away
with £lOOO, and an-
other with £6OO.
There is also that
horrible statue of
the gorilla carrying
oft a woman. How-
ever, that cost
nothing: Fremiet
presented it to the
Trustees when they
bought his Joan of
Arc. It had been
a white elephant to
him. Paris jour-
nals had engraved
it at first and made
a sensation if it; but a fierce re-
vulsion set in. Possibly some mil-
lionaire of Caliban instinct may
buy it. As for the pictures,
transplant them to the Athenaeum,
freely show them and sell them by
auction if they fetch the reserves ;
the balance to remain for private
sale. Such is the variation of
artistic taste that it is absolutely
certain the Sydney, Adelaide, Bal-
larat, Bendigo, Geelong, Perth or
Hobart Public Gallery committees
would buy some, and none can be
so bad as to find no private buyers.
Many of Turner’s works, con-

THE MORAL OBLIGATION
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A higher and more valuable homage will be paid
by the wife when she enters into the marriage con-
tract unfettered by any obligation to obey her hus-
bund.—Women's Political Assoc, speaker.
Oh, husband mine, should it appear
That I am needlessly severe;
When with a flat-iron deftly spun
I dinge your forehead, darling one,
Bethink you, love, my hand would stay
Had I not promised to obey.
The tea I threw, likewise the pot
(Admit, my soul, that both were hot),
And through my eloquence this week
You’ve had no sleep of which to speak,
But things, my sweet, must go that way,
Since men have sworn me to obey.
T ,, . .
When I am scratching at your eyes,
Or feeding you on leather pies,
Remember in your miser-ee
My obligations fetter me.
->t , . . ,
Lour wounds assert my freedom—they
Assure the world I don’t obey!
My dear, were T not sworn to be
Obedient, you’d find in me
A doting wife who’d pay to you
The homage that’s a husband’s due;
But, love, you know I’m certain not to
Do any mortal thing I’ve got to.

SPEECH BY SENATOR McCOUU
“THE CANCER OF THE CAUCUS."
In supporting the adoption of a
report dealing generally with the
work of the Church, which was
presented to the Victoria and
Tasmania Afethodist Conference to-
day, the Rev. F. J, Nance, M.A.,
deplored the fact that there were
men and women in the Church who
had fallen victims to the week-
end habit—a habit which often
caused them to fall away from the
Church.

A member of a recent American Manufacturers’ Trade Commission said that they had nothing but the kindliest intentions towards Australia, but hoped latter

to bestow on a young and growing nation.

One Braham, a London journalist, is men-
tioned as the successor of Whiskers Ward,
of the Sydney Telegraph. Nobody seems
to know anything much about Braham, and
the reference books are dumb concerning
him. Associate-editor Courtney would have
got the job, if merit had been the only con-
sideration. lie labors under the handicap,
however, of being an R.C. —a fatal objection
from the viewpoint of the Telegraph direc-
torate. He has been editor, in all but name,
for months at a stretch; and he will neces-
sarily be editor in all but name for many
months after the new importation arrives.
It is not alleged that he made any attempt,
during the different periods that he has
controlled the ’Graph, to hand it over to the
Vatican. Still, its proprietors are taking
no chances. A number of the paper’s adver-
tisers are good Methodies, and they would
simply loathe to be presented to the Vatican.

One of the pillars of the Ulster move-
ment fell, or at the least, was severely
shaken, when a receiving order in bank-
ruptcy was made against Lord Templetown,
in London, last month. It is a humorous
circumstance that the only book he ever
wrote was called “Profitable Dairy-farming.”
He is the type of really earnest Protestant
who will ascribe his financial downfall en-
tirely to the Vatican.
Collins-street Baptist church can boast of
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
- T. Ruth being the name of its new im-
ported parson. By the way, he said, in
answer to a press interviewer:—
Why have I come to Australia ? It was under
the influence of an impelling force, a Divine guid-
ance, if you will, which there was no resisting.
It was not dependent on reason, it was above it.
Talking of “impelling forces,” the screw is
one of the most powerful known to
mechanics; and. while on the subject of
screws, that of the Collins-street church
above-mentioned is the biggest in the Bap-
tist world of Australia.
AN EYE TO BUSINESS.
Rev. J. E. Carruthers moved as an amend-
ment : “That a minister be appointed to
the Federal city, Canberra, and that it be
notified to the several annual conferences that
a ministerial appointment is being made, and that
the annual conferences be appealed to, for their co-
operation and support, in terms of the resolutions of
the General Conference of 1913.” The amendment
was carried.
“So, my deah brother, you are willing to
sacrifice yourself in that waterless waste.'

say, “ ’Ere comes that ’umbug, ’urnming ’is

__ Passed out, at the early age of 53, John
Kneeshaw, for a long time superintendent
of Sydney tramways. He was a native of
Ballarat (Victoria), but he spent most of
his days in Maoriland, and many of them
on the Maoriland railways. He is chiefly re-
membered there as a demon auditor, who saw
a missing “bob” farther off than the old man
saw the Prodigal Son. “The liaven,” who
figured in a number of C. A. Jeffries’s “Rail
and Semaphore” tales, was Kneeshaw in the
flesh. The inscription on his tombstone
should be that he was thorough. What-
ever he set out to do he did well —in fact,
he did it like thunder. And as already men-
tioned he was born at Ballarat. He wasn’t
imported.
The action of the late Mrs. R. L. Steven-
son, in leaving her daughter-in-law a sover-
eign in her will, and seizing the opportunity
to state in the crudest and most infuriated
language her opinion of the beneficiary’s
temper, disposition, etc., draws attention to
a very old abuse. It is a common thing for
a vindictive person to “cut someone off with
a shilling,” as an excuse for getting in a
razor-edged assault on the latter’s character.
In the writer's opinion the practice is grossly
inequitable. There is no more reason why
one should be held up to public opprobrium
from the grave than from a bar door or a
street corner. In fact, the former is less
justifiable, inasmuch as a corpse is one of
those things that nobody gets any joy out of
kicking or rebuking. Since the law can’t
touch the remains—though something might
be done in the way of a short Act invalidat-
ing any will which contained insulting lan-
guage—its best plan would be to leap upon
the remains’ aiders and abettors in the mat-
ter. Any solicitor who drew up, or helped
to draw up, a will which contained libelous
matter ought to be liable in the same way as
though he had been guilty of the libel him-
self, upon the same being made public. It
wouldn’t be a bad scheme if the witnesses
were joined as well. Let the Government
interfere sternly with the liberty of the
deceased subject, as regards the spilling of
venom on possibly inoffensive people, under
the lying guise of generosity. To a sporting
nation this trick of shooting from beneath
tombstones is repulsive.

“Who’s Who” for 1914 gives Ilume Cook
as “Prime Minister of the Commonwealth

are born Cook it is much better to get out
of the ruck by changing your name to Bottle-
washer or Dripping.
Last week Frederick Martin, the Yankee
millionaire “philanthropist” who published
books about the Idle Rich and Exalted Snobs
and so forth, died suddenly at a Piccadilly
(London) hotel “after dining with a peer.”
It was the penalty he paid for feeding luxu-
riously with a member of the class he affected
to despise. Had Martin shared a supper of
herbs with one of the Energetic Poor he
would probably have been feeling quite well
at the present moment.
From this paper’s Oldest Inhabitant: —
A recent S. M. Herald article on Waterloo stated
that in 1823 Governor Denison granted one Hutchin-
son 1400 acres of land south of Sydney. Two years
later Mr. Hutchinson sold his estate to Messrs.
Cooper and Levy, of George-street, for £2700, paid
in Spanish dollars of the value of ss. each.
This g-rant included the whole of the pre-
sent municipality of Waterloo, also a portion
of the borough of Alexandria, and an area
in ltedfern and Randwick. Cooper and Levy
decided to call the estate Waterloo. According
to the S. M. Herald, the Waterloo ground belongs
to the William Cooper who is now, or was recently, in
Sydney. It also alleges that the Daniel Cooper who be-
came a baronet was the son of the Daniel Cooper of
Cooper and Levy, owners of Waterloo warehouse and
Waterloo Estate. As a matter of fact, Daniel Cooper, of
Cooper and Levy, died childless and left his means
to his brother’s children, the present owner being
the grandson of that brother. Likewise, Sir William
Denison did l.ot come to Sydney as Governor until
the mid-fifties, 30 years after Cooper bought from
Hutchinson. This Hutchinson (William by name)
was a very early “colonist” and was on Norfolk
Island as a sort of overseer of convicts. He was
sent there for misconduct. When Norfolk Island
was abandoned he came—or was brought, rather—
back to Sydney, and was employed as an overseer of
convicts, and eventually succeeded Isaac Nichols in
the post of Chief Superintendent. He was known
as the “Convicts’ Banker.” It was his kindly hobby
to take care of their savings; sometimes he took
very great care indeed. He owned —and it is still in
the family—the S.-E. corner of King and Georgc-
streets, including the Arcade, and much town pro-
perty which he carefully hoarded up. He was one
of the founders of the Bank of N. S. Wales, though
he was not on the original board. Hutchinson’s name
was once almost in as constant use as Macquarie’s

Hildred Carlile, who was round Aus-
tralia witli the British Parliamentary party
last year, has handed a useful cheque for
£105.000 to the Bedford College (in London)
for the higher education of women. Pro-
bably he thinks he owes it them, for his
money comes out of Coats, Limited, of the
sewing-cotton Trust.
Joseph Cook complains that he cannot
“carry on with dignity” under existing cir-
cumstances. He has this paper’s sympathy.
It is a truly Herculean job to essay, with a
precarious majority of one, to call a poli-
tical adversary a “dingo” and his opinions
“tripe,” and at the same time remain really
dignified.

listening to nice things about himself.
In N.S.W. during 1911-12-13 employers
were fined £2895 for breakages of industrial
awards, while were fined £92 11s.
Of course if the law had been enforced, even
to the extent of 2s. per head against the
40,000-odd strikers who treated industrial
awards with great scoff in the single year
1913, the figures would have been different.
But nowadays there is such a fear of en-
forcing the law lest votes should be lost that
nobody is fined much and almo. t everybody
is fined nothing.
The short history of the Seaddan (W.A.)
Government’s futile contract for the supply
ot sleepers for the transcontinental railway
apP J e i l I rs *°, this: Seaddan was a
muddler who was six months late and never
delivered a single serviceable sleeper; and
Cook was a blatant Tory who was glad right
down to his boots that Seaddan had made
a mess of things and who would probably
have made a worse mess himself. They
parted with mutual disrespect. Seaddan
went to look at his rather unfortunate State
steamship line, and Cook to make a closer
inspection of his military flying machines
which would be all right if they would only
fly.
“HIS EXCELLENCYOF MAORILAND
(LORD LIVERPOOL).
By “0.K.” :
Canada acquired many strange and comic immi-
grants in the days when it reached out for all and
sundry that looked like human meat. It acquired
Muscovites and Slovaks and Slovenes, long-haired
folk, anti-washers, communists, Second Adventists,
Fifth Monarchy people, anti-marriage fanatics and
all manner of freaks. The latest trouble is with the
Muscovites —a pious and unwashen lot. According
to a recent cablegram, “Six thousand Russian peas-
ants in British Columbia threaten to march the
streets unclad as a protest against the levying for
penalties upon communal property for individual
offences.” Assuming that the aggrieved Muscovites
meditate this all-round display of nudity as a touch-
ing evidence of their hard-up condition, it is still
evident that they are one-eyed in their view of
things. They protest against the idea that com-
munal sharing of collective profits involves communal
responsibility for individual debts. They reckon, fo>
instance, that when a communist importer is fined
£2O for defrauding the Customs, the money ought
not to come out of the commune’s “pool.” Com-
munism wants educating in the ethics of joint-stock
business.
N.S.W. Education Minister Carmichael is
again requested to consider this recent utter-
ance of his :—-
In regard to decentralisation the Premier proposes,
on his return, to go into the matter as fully as
practicable. . . .There will, I think, be a pronounce-
ment before very long relative to the Government’s
decentralisation proposals. They have reached a
certain stage already. .. .A good deal of correspond-
dence has taken place. . . .Though no very active steps
have been taken and no definite pronouncement made
still a good deal of work is being done in gathering
the information. .. .something practical will be
attempted.
The opening up and making available of the
closed ports of N.S.W. is a definite feature
of the Government’s programme, unless the
Government is a liar and a fraud, while the
floating of big loans isn’t a feature. It
seems really a pity that it can’t find time to
attend to its very special principle while it
can find so much leisure for the thing that is
contrary to its alleged principles. Perhaps
now that Holman has returned, and has
announced his intention of borrowing
£8,500,000, he may find a moment to look at
the above matter.
VICE-REGAL DUTIES
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Wednesday.—Lady Galway, wife of Lieu-
tenant-General Sir Henry Galway, newly-appointed
Governor of South Australia, in the course of an in-
terview, said that she looked forward to the outdoor
life of Australia. Her daughter was a keen sports-
woman, while the Governor’s staff were enthusiastic
cricketers. Sir Henry, she said, was interested in
horse-racing.— Cable.
It is—it is a glorious thing
To he a gay, colonial king—
To open bazaars for lisping beauties,
And attend to various sporting duties.
A game of tennis the day begins ;
Then maybe a round of golf be wins.
An innings at cricket, if he be spry,
Then out where the galloping gee-gees fly,
And female visions the lawn are pacing.
(An Ex. is right if he’s fond of racing.)
For Africa you must know a bit;
In Canada only a duke can sit ;
Then India is a ticklish billet—
It takes an experienced man to fill it.
But any recruit in decent health
Can boss a slice of the Commonwealth,
And open bazaars and give a look
To the local Fisher and Joseph Cook.
But of all duties the first, of course,
Is backing the lean and speedy horse.
It is a boon, at any rate,
To be an office boy of State,
And have a proper reverence
For jobs that seem to you immense.
How nice to think your qualities
Fit you for jobs beyond the seas,
And that your duties you’ll not shirk
Because you know you'll love your work.
God bless his Ex. ! his place he graces.
He takes an interest in races!

*This includes “premiums purchasing paid-up poli-
cies allocated from cash bonuses not drawn.”
fThis includes “cash bonuses”—£l7,22l for 1911,
£19,512 for 1912 and £22,770 for 1913.
This office, which is full of ideas, and gets off the old,
beaten track the minute it is satisfied a new one is
better, adopts an unusual practice which makes the
foregoing footnote necessary. It shows its bonus
transactions in its Revenue and Expenditure account
—on the expenditure side “Cash bonus declared for
year” and on the revenue side the additions to poli-
cies paid for by bonuses not drawn in cash. Under
this system the office certainly sets out plainly the
aggregate of the bonus and the amount absorbed in
buying extra paid-up insurance; and this is at least
a partial set-off against the inflation of the figures
which is another result of the system. There is no
doubt that a policy-holder does pay for the extra
insurance. But he doesn’t pay twice." He pays once,
but because he over-pays he gets some additional bene-
fits later on. And since he pays only once it is
exceedingly doubtful whether the excess payments
devoted to the purchase of extra insurance should
appear twice on the Revenue side of the accounts. It
goes without saying that there is nothing wrong
with the thing itself, inasmuch as there are balancing
entries the other side. There is merely room for a
difference of opinion about the method of doing the
thing.
To further distinguish itself from most other offices
the City Mutual hasn’t for many years struggled for
big business totals. Any office can do £25,000 a year
of new business at comparatively small expense,
“working” people who have already come within the
society’s influence; to get the next £25,000 may
easily cost it three times as much, for new ground
and less promising ground may have to be broken to
get it. This society has been aiming at what it
could get at reasonable cost, relying, no doubt, on
the superior bonuses which that system should produce
to attract a bigger volume of business by-and-bye.
Still, in spite of this policy, expenses are not strik-
ingly low so far. though they are moving quickly in
the right direction. Deducting from the income the
amount received in single premiums, which are wholly
or almost wholly the cash bonuses before-mentioned,
these figures are produced:—
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1902 ..£23 3 2 p.c. 1908 ..£25 17 1 p.c.
1903 .. 22 3 9 „ 1909 .. 27 7 7 „

1905 .. 22 4 7 „ 1911 .. 20 13 10 „
1906 .. 24 5 6 „ 1912 .. 20 14 0 „
1907 .. 22 18 2 „ 1913 . . 18 17 3 „
That isn’t much of a method for ascertaining an
office’s expense rate, because an office which is get-
ting a lot of good, persistent business may be doing
better than a lazy office, though the latter may show
the better expense rate, since it spends so little
on the hunt for new policies. Following The
Bulletin’s plan of allowing 7 p.c. on the renewal
premiums for the cost of carrying on the old business
(including the care of investments and 3 p.c. on
the annuity business), it will be found that the new
business cost 91 p.c. of the first year’s premiums.
But with a comparatively small office like this, 7 p.c.
on old business is probably too little to allow.
And then there is another thing: this office doesn’t
despise the small, profitable loan, and its control of
investments costs much more p.c. than in most offices.
The result, however, is to give it a very remarkable
interest return. On its mean insurance funds last
year it got no less than £5 14s. 9d. p.c.; and on
top of that it claimed a profit of an even £5500 on
investments. But very wisely it set aside the whole
of this profit, transferring £4500 of the amount to
a contingency account (now £20,000) and writing
assets down with the balance. But it has such faith
in itself as an investor that, not content with hand-
ling its own funds, it now has £36,016 of deposits
at interest, as against £1259 12 months ago. The
management’s success with its investments is cheer-
fully admitted; yet this practice of risking the
policy-holders’ money by taking deposits and invest-
ing them (which means that Hie policy-holders’ money
must guarantee the repayment, the co. having no
share capital) is open to serious objection on prin-
ciple. The thing necessary in a life office is safety ;
the thing desirable is cheap net insurance, which in
a general way means big bonuses. To make money
by handling outsiders’ capital may produce the desir-
able thing; It can’t assist in securing the necessary
thing. While the present brains and energy are
available to the society things might go on all right
even if the loans were 10 times as great; but the
present brains and energy can’t be available for ever.

The drop in profits is very considerable, but, then, no

in other ways and directions things weren’t all that
they used to be. The reserves mentioned above are
made up as follows:
Reserve Fund .. ~ £4,501 18 1
Insurance Fund .... .... 20,908 19 3
Undivided Profit 8,347 17 4
£33,758 14 8
The insurance fund, which is really the value of
unexpired policies, can’t honestly be called a reserve.
An insurance fund of £20,908, Which stands against
some £600,000 worth of combustible property, is
more like a shortage than an accumulation. There is
also a fund for depreciation, repairs, contingencies,
renewals, superannuation, etc., which stands at
£30,507. At the end of 1912 it was £30,849, so
it has diminished somewhat. It certainly isn’t a
big fund considering the burden it has to carry.
Some other points are as follows:

The Anglian has been sold, the report says at a
satisfactory figure, and no one would be casting
undue aspersions at a very honest and respectable
ship, if he said it was a good old patriarch to get
rid of. It wasn’t new when the firm got it, and the
firm has had it quite a while. Presumably this
sale accounts for a good part of the diminution in
the ship property item, and the increase in the cash
item. But after setting one against the other, the
fact remains that the increase in liquid assets doesn’t
balance the decline in fixed assets, and the net result
is a drop in the total value of the co.’s property, as
well as in its profits, its dividends, the amount car-
ried to reserve and the amount held to provide for
replacements, pensions, etc. The position is still
strong by reason of the large amount of capital
invested in Government securities and the like, but
it is hardly so strong as it was. The year was a
stormy one for shipping companies, for the indus-
trial disturbance was on hand almost all the time.
And apart from that there is reason to suspect that
the boom is wandering into the sere and yellow leaf,
as all booms and bubbles and loan frenzies do.

The Bulletin puts it that way, but doesn’t like it.
Here are the facts. Hart’s business (goodwill) was
sold to the co. for £11,700, shown as the deficit with
which the table starts. Payment was made in
shares ; and payment in the same form was made for
most or all of the other assets. These other assets
included a George-strcet lease, or rather a sub-lease,
which the vendors valued at and sold to the co. for
no less than £7OO0 —which looks like a rather
undue reflection on the reputedly wideawake man who
let the sub-lease. This £7OOO, though a doubtful
asset, is reckoned as an asset in the table; and so is
£545 paid for a Pitt-street lease. Then there are
improvements on leaseholds —things that cost a lot
of money, but must be written off out of profits
during the currency of the leases. Excluding these
assets, this is the position:—
Cash and deposits £1,026
Stock 3,648
Sundry debtors 3,265
Plant, furniture, etc 39,265
Total £47,204
Less liabilities .. .. 14,098
Net tangible assets as above.. £33,106
The bulk of the tangible assets are thus plant, furni-
ture, crockery, etc. ; and they are all liable to heavy
depreciation. Whether enough has been provided out
of profits to. cover this depreciation, it is. impossible
to say. As far as can be seen, the only amount
provided in the past half-year is the £5OO shown
as written off, and this apparently has to cover
amortization of leases and leasehold improvements as
well. It seems to be totally inadequate for the pur-
pose, and the only thing that can be said in mitiga-
tion is that in the previous half-year £3OOO was
provided, which was probably more than enough.
As for the tremendous slump in gross profits during
the half-year, the directors say it was due to “the
falling-off of business during the small-pox scare.”
Why the small-pox scare should have singled out
Hart’s for this scurvy treatment, and allowed such
other providores as Sargent’s and the Hotel Metro-
pole to escape, isn’t plain. It is possible that the
directors are deceiving themselves; and in business
there is nothing much more disastrous than that.
If you have got a broken leg, and put splints on your
arm because you swear it’s your arm that’s broken,
it doesn’t do your leg much good; and, incidentally,
it doesn’t do your arm much good either. The
directors had better look round to see if there isn’t a
broken leg somewhere. If there isn’t, and if the
profits can’t be very much improved, the chances of
writing off enough to properly provide for the depre-
ciation of goodwill and leaseholds, etc., are bad. The
capital is £50,000, and, especially with profits so
erratic, there is far too much of that principal repre-
sented by goodwill and other intangible assets and
by assets of little value apart from the business.

The directors risk the unluckiness of 13 and push
the dividend up to that figure; and The Bulletin
isn’t prepared to throw abusive language at them
for doing it, inasmuch as 13 p.c. only just absorbs
the interest earned on investments, leaving practically
the whole of the underwriting profit to lay by. There
has been a very fine increase in the business, too;
and, better still, the getting of the new business
hasn’t involved any serious increase in the general
expense rate. Here are the figures:—

In ordinary circumstances a co. which had very
nearly doubled its premium income in eight years
might be expected to show rather poor funds in pro-
portion to risks taken, because in such cases the risks
generally outpace the accumulations; but the Stan-
dard’s position in that respect is still excellent.
Capital and reserves (after paying the dividend)
total £214,676, which is equal to 213 p.c. of the
year’s premiums, or about 40 p.c. more than the
English average; and the bigger the percentage of
funds the better, of course, is the policy-holder’s
security. And on top of that security the policy-
holder has £925,000 of uncalled capital to fall
back upon: only 15s. is paid on each share, and the
holder is liable for another £9 5s. —quite enough to
make him take a personal interest in seeing that no
Juggins gets on the Board, if there are any Jugginses
in Dunedin. And apart from that large uncalled
capital there is the comforting fact that out of the
current year’s surplus revenue, added to the funds in
hand, the co. could pay claims seven times greater
than the average losses of the past six years, or six
times greater than the losses in the most disastrous
year during that period. A policy-holder who wants
better security than that ought to put his property in
a safe deposit and swallow the key. The one doubt
that pushes itself into the matter is whether the co.
could raise any very large sum without sacrificing
some of its assets. For all ordinary purposes its
£43,799 of deposits and till money is no doubt
ample; for the rest £113,680 is in mortgages and
£50,630 in unspecified debentures, and this money
looks too tightly nailed down for a fire and marine
insurance co.’s purposes. In any case, it is desirable
that out of the fine interest return —an average of
about 5 p.c. on the investments —a contingency fund
should be provided for writing off the losses that
now and then are practically inevitable with tin's
class of security. The co. may have such a fund;
but if it has it keeps it up its sleeve.

Some details being unavailable, the figures for the
past 12 months are given in a lump instead of by
half-years. The disclosed profits are better than
usual, and allow of a larger _lay-by in spite or the
increased dividend—an increase which the very con-
servative directors only permitted themselves after
long consideration. The published accounts are a
mere skeleton, and possibly don’t give much idea
of how the co. is really doing. It is the easiest thing
in the world for shipping directors to either inflate
their profits or give them a pale, consumptive
appearance. By writinsr off either too little or too
much profit ostensiblv to cover depreciation they
can make the same accounts look like either George
Reid or Iceberg Irvine, The natural inclination of
the Newcastle and Hunter River directors is to pro-
duce something that looks like Irvine. Hence in the
past six years it appears that the surplus of profits
over dividends has been less than £3OOO altogether.
But dig deeper and get this:—
June, June, Dec., Dec.,
1909. 1912. 1912. 1913.
Ship property .. £85,350 £58,875 £56,551 £49,600
Freeholds, etc. .. 3,036 1,484 1,700 1,358
Plant, etc. .. 5,446 3,462 3,414 3,854
Liquid assets . . 24,624 61,260 69,491 76,344
So between June, 1909, and Dec., 1913—four and a
half years—liquid assets (mostly deposits) have in-
creased by £51,720 ; or, after providing for all lia-
bilities, by £46,903. Meantime no new capital has
been got in from shareholders. Certainly this
£46,903 piled up in years may not all be surplus
profit, or even profit set aside to cover depreciation.
Some of it may be the proceeds of other assets sold
or lost and paid for by the underwriters. But there
probably hasn’t been very much of that; anyway,
the assets that are left seem capable of earning
more than those which the co. held a few years ago.
Altogether, then, though the true position of the
co. can’t be stated with certainty, it looks highly
probable that the co. is earning its dividend very
comfortably after making the most ample provision
for depreciation ; and its finances are so strong that,
after providing for all liabilities (including the cur-
rent dividend), it has more than 10s. per share in
hard cash and another 2s. in liquid assets.

This is the concern with which AV. .T. Miles, re-
putedly the largest individual shareholder, has been
having a willing battle, which lasted right through
the courts up to the Privy Council. Miles lost, the
Judges laying down the dangerous doctrine that a
co. need not aim at making profits for the general
body of shareholders, but may disburse the money
which might otherwise be profits in the shape of sub-
sidies to certain shareholders who are also suppliers.
In this case, the money goes to pastoralists, some of
whom are shareholders. Miles’s misfortune is that
he isn’t a pastoralist, and, therefore, gets no benefits
at all, since the co. never pays and never has paid a
dividend. The position is weird. Generally speak-
ing, when the co. makes a profit it means that the
shareholders haven’t been doing very well, since the
co. has been able to buy stock at a comparatively
low price; and the whole purpose of the co. (now
declared to be quite legal) is to bump up the price
of stock, in the interest of the stock-owning and
stock-selling shareholders. This wouldn’t matter
much to the public, only, unfortunately, when this
co.’s representative at the sales bids £lO for a
beast, he has to pay only (say) £9 10s., the other
10s. being rebated; consequently, in order to get a
beast for which the co. can’t afford to pay more than
£9 10s., the public has to pay something in excess
of £lO. It is a beautifully ingenious scheme, which
does infinite credit to Alban Gee, who evolved it
nearly 50 years ago; and that Sydney has stood
it for so long shows that Sydney is either very dull
or very long-suffering. The one reasonable thing
ihat can be said in the co.’s defence is that it keeps
the grower of stock from being exploited by rings
of carcase-butchers, who might otherwise take things
into their own hands and agree to offer ruinously -
low prices for live meat without giving the 'public any of
the benefit of their bargains. Such an action would
justify a Government in going out with an axe and
killing the ring stone-dead; but it doesn’t justify
another combination in making the public, through
the butchers, bid always against a fictitious price—
for the bid of the S.M.P. Co. is fictitious. The
paid-up capital is £20,315; but, as no dividends
have been paid, and as it has sometimes been im-
possible to avoid making profits, reserves of £67,010
have been accumulated, and are invested in works
cr used for financing the business, which has a
turnover that varies a lot, but is generally some-
where between £400,000 and £500,000 a year.

Of the past year’s dividend 5 p.c. was paid for the
first half and 3 p.c. for the second half. The shrink-
age in the profits isn’t explained; possibly it was
due to Sydney’s record long dry spell in the last four
months of the year, coupled with the generally un-
favorable conditions of trade and higher manufactur-
ing and distributing costs. Conditions of trade for
this co. have improved, wet feet being now common
again ; but costs are not likely to be materially re-
duced —anyway, for some time to come. And the
chances are that in the bulk of their lines Perdriau’s
can’t pass the extra cost on in the offhand way that
the butcher or the baker or the coastal shipping
man can. You can’t import bread or fresh meat
with much success, and if you sent to London or
Belgium for a pound’s worth of Australian coastal
freight they would probably tell you that they didn’t
have any, but they could let you have a fine, cheap
line in goloshes, or rainproof overcoats or motor-car
tyres. Which suggests that in selecting industrials
the investor might do worse than distinguish, for one
thing, between those concerns which can conveni-
ently pass extra costs on and those which can’t, extra
costs being a tremendously important factor in Aus-
tralian industry at present.
The Perdriau Co. was formed in 1904 to take over
an old-established business which wanted capital for
expansion. The co.’s capital to start with was
£40,008 ; £30,000 of this was paid in shares to the
vendor, half of it being for the goodwill. Hence the
table starts with a deficit, that amount of capital
being unrepresented by tangible assets. The ex-
pected extension of trade came along, and as the
co. was paying out excellent divs., it had no diffi-
culty in getting in the requisite capital. This is
how that and other lines have moved
1908. 1911. 1912. 1913.

Other assets .. 2,740 552 833 904
Thus in five years £BO,OOO of new capital has been
got in and liabilities to the public have been in-
creased by £26,530. Of this £106,530, along with
nearly £20,000 of accumulated profits and share
premiums, extra stock represents approximately
£60,000 and extra plant and premises £ 57,000. For
the most part this has been the result of a fine manu-
facturing development. But the Protection that was
sufficient to encourage this development is not in
some cases sufficient to maintain it, owing to in-
creased local costs. Fortunately, however, the manu-
facturer is not now wholly at the mercy of Parlia-
ment, which from its very size and nature couldn’t
deal with such commercial details in a business-like
way. The Inter-State Commission can, and the Aus-
tralian manufacturer has a chance that he never had
before.

The extra 2 p.c. paid this half-year comes in the
form of a shilling-a-share bonus, following on an
exceptionally profitable half-year; and the directors
hold out no encouragement to shareholders to expect
it as a regular thing. The co. by careful manage-
ment has put itself into a much-improved financial
position. Take this 10-year comparison:—
1903. 1913.
Liquid assets .. .. .. £10,372 £29,160
Liabilities .. .. .. 31,879 20,518
Excess liabilities .. .. £21,507
Excess assets .. .. .. £8,642
Of the £20,518 of liabilities £20,000 consists of
4 p.c. debentures, which the directors propose to
further reduce during the current half-year; 10 years
ago they owed £30,000 on this account. Thus
during 10 years the co. has (1) paid off £lO,OOO of
debentures, (2) paid a regular dividend, (3) made
extensive renewals and repairs, amounting to some-
where about £2OOO a half-year and (4) added
£20,149 to its surplus of liquid assets—a perform-
ance that speaks volumes for the management. Not,
of course, that the management is entirely responsible.
Look at the growth- of traffic receipts, for six months
in each case: Dec., 1903, £6811; Dec., 1912,
£10,493; Dec., 1913, £15,301; and the working
expenses during the same period have increased only
from £5419 to £6200; which leaves £7709 more
to go to dividends, reserves, etc., for the past half-
year than there was for the corresponding half of
droughty 1903. But the co. can never hope to grow
to anything like Silverton Tramway proportions. It
depends almost entirely on the district’s wool and
stock and wheat, and with Fat Landlords and drought
—Deniliquin being out on the very far edge of the
wheat country—the traffic is not likely to increase
very rapidly. On the other hand, there is no visible
reason whatever why its average should diminish.

substitute electricity. Part of the revenue (and no
doubt also a fraction of the profit) will thus
presently be lost. What size the fraction is to be,
time must show. For the present all that can be
said is that it is not safe to take the co.’s perform-
ance in the past as a guide to what it is going to
do in the future. As to the financial strength ot
the co., liquid and semi-liquid assets stand at £2866
and liabilities at £486, a surplus of £2380 not a
very strong position for a co. that is threatened
with municipal competition. Gas sales, compared
with the figures for the corresponding half of 1912,
show an increase from £3540 to £3844. But, as
mentioned above, things are liable to show some
change directly in this respect.

The Broken Hill Prop, kept mum about
its ore reserves in its last half-yearly report, and,
for that matter, in the one before as well. Tak-
ing the last published figures as a bfasis, there
are about 1,750,000 tons available, which would last
only six years at the recent rate of extraction. And
diamond-drilling persistently refuses to show any
more bodies of any account. Last half-year the
drills bored 3418 ft., and caught nothing to speak
of—a 2ft. vein of 17 p.c. lead ore in the western
mineralised zone was the best if not only fish. The
co. is running so short of working faces to keep
up its present output that it is now going into the
1500 ft. level. This, of course, will be near the
Block 10 boundary. There are three blocks in the
mine—-11, 12 and 13, running from south to north.
In the northern half of block 12, nothing of value is
found below 400 ft. (this is up against Block 14) ;
in the southern half, the bottom of the ores is at
500 ft. In block 12 the ore, 500 ft. deep at most in
the north end, runs to about 850 ft. at the south
boundary. (Practically all the ore in these two
blocks is worked out.) Fortunately the ore doesn’t
flatten out so rapidly in block 11 ; if it did there
would have been none below 1200 ft. Still, even in
block 11, the shoot at every fresh level is getting
appreciably shorter.

“P.X.”: With a pocket full of money to
spend and a keen scent for a profit, how is it that
Rupert Clarke isn’t including a scientist in his
Papuan exploring party? The three men who are to
go with him on the long ramble are no doubt most
excellent in their way (as rough and ready pros-
pectors you can’t beat the Prykes), but they know
nothing except of the severely “practical” sort about
economic geology; and a scientific man who is an
•economic geologist might not only save the baronet
a heap of useless toil in impossible places, or direct
the thoughts of the party towards minerals that they
wouldn’t otherwise think of, but also (with the
baronet’s consent) do the public a big service. In
fact, it might well pay the Government to obtain
Clarke’s permission to attach a geologist to the
party and share the expense of the expedition, though
I suspect the boss would rather do the thing entirely
on his own.

A few figures from the records of the
Great Southern Consols, ltutherglen (Vic.): Cash
and calls, £62,910; gold, £348,416. These sug-
gest a long list of dividends. The other side is that,
while £411,326 has fallen into the co.’s coffers,
only £19,000 of profits have reached shareholders.
No. 1 shaft and its workings mopped up £363,817,
and NO. 2 £17,801. Labor was paid nearly
£270,000, and the balance went in plant and the
etceteras that suck up cash like a sponge when deep-
lead mining is started. The co. is now increasing
the call to 6d., to get fresh plant to try the new
run of wash W. J. Trevillyan believes he has walked
into west of a south intermediate drive. Even if
he proves its existence, more calls will be needed
before the puddlers can churn out profits.

Eighty years of battling haven’t turned
rugged John Cock away from his old love, the Chil-
tern Valley (Vic.). His co. now has the choice of
the countryside, so it has deepened the shaft, shifted
the plant, and set out to get under the gutter at a
spot where gold ought to be, and where water
is sure to be. Everything is going on under the
veteran in the most workmanlike way. The top
level is aimed at wash and will be carried right
across it if pluck has any say in the job. The co.
got in a financial fix lately, as first estimates didn’t
pan out right. This brought the underwriters on
the scene, and a bobbery has been kicked up. Quid-
nuncs shouted that a bit of a grab had been made.
Instead of that, shareholders should bless their
precious boots that a faithful few were ready to
stand shoulder to shoulder with old John Cock in
giving the claim another run.

Six months have been devoted by the
Champion Amalgamated, at Ten Mile, in the Moun-
tains (Vic.), to breaking into its big make of stone
in the northern ground. The people who shoulder
the Champion are still full of hope and confidence.
Their first disappointment has been the shrinkage of
the Champion lode where cut in the No. 2 inter-
mediate to 6in. of barren mineralised formation.
Bv driving north something may be got, but so far
this part has drawn a blank. The saving grace of
the other shoot is that it can he worked for next to
nothing.

While molybdenite was used only for
hardening steel cutting tools it was worth only
about £3O per ton. Then the military people began
to require it for hardening the tips of bullets, and
it soared up to £2OO per ton. The supply was
limited, and every bullet-maker in the world howled
loudly for more and could not get it. So the price
kept soaring till now it is worth £520 per ton.
And since that terrific bound the production has
dropped by about 50 per cent. The other day the
French chemists who have been studying how to
preserve cordite ammunition discovered that the
life of their explosive could be doubled by the use
of molybdenite, so another jump is expected any
day. The chief sources of supply are Norway,
Queensland and New South Wales. There are de-
posits in the Pontiac county of Quebec, Canada, and
also in Cumberland (England). The trouble is not
the rarity of molybdenite, but the fact that it is
rarely found in large quantities. In Australia it
occurs mostly in granite and quartz—in the latter it
is generally in nugget form. It is a disappointing
mineral. The best deposits give out quickest, and
the profit on the first discovery is swallowed up in
the effort to pick up the lode, which, mostly, doesn’t
exist.
The Australian miner who handles rare
metals has a hard row to hoe. One of him recently
sent a consignment of molybdenite to Germany for
treatment. Some time later he received a cable
saying that it was worthless and requesting him. to
remove it. Most men would have replied requesting
the works people to dump it somewhere out Of the
road, but this one didn’t. He cabled to some Eng-
lish people, and they acted With unusual velocity.
Their agent dropped in, collared the ore, shipped it
to England, and later on the works remitted nearly
£2700 for that consignment. All of which shows
how necessary it is that Australia should be in a
position to treat all and any of its own ores. No
doubt the German crowd hoped the mine would be
abandoned, and also, no doubt, it had someone on
the spot ready to take it up immediately the Aus-
tralian walked out.

Hope Extended, Beaufort (Vie.), had
spent about £5OOO on shaft sinking and surface
work when a strike happened. But it has got going
again, and with only 200 ft. to drive to get under
the Hope lead it won’t take long to find out pros-
pects there, as the gutter is dry. Then a shot will
be made at the deep lead that is supposed to be
the prime possession of the CO., but it will take a
long time to get there,
New Chum Goldfields, Bendigo (Vic.),
still shells out profits from the shoot of gold which
pitches into it from the cap of the saddle worked in
the North Bendigo next door at about 1030 ft. Divs,
are almost as frequent as with the Central Biufe
patch, though they stick at the shilling. There is
this difference between the two mines: The gold
shoots of the Central Blue had length and breadth
with richness. Goldfields shoot ik short and tapers
out on the pitch, When narrow shoots are being
broken into with eager hands the liability exists to
spread-eagle rapidly outside the pay zone, especially
if they narrow in width as followed down. Hence
the trouble of swallowing the' yarn that 1000 ft. of
good stuff is ahead. Co. has a nice cash balance, but
the divs. are too frequent.
Victoria in two months’ mining this year
has won 64,9880 z. gold. This is 19830 z. more than
in January and February of 1912, so a long record
of dwindling monthly returns has at last been
broken.

Westralian Mines Department is
ing a mania for reckless risks, Its handling of the
Mines Development vote makes onlookers occasionally
shudder, and it is now giving them the creeps by
pledging itself to an advance up to £l5OO on a
more or less job lot of machinery at Randeils and
the expenditure of £BOOO or thereabouts on a
plant to treat slimes at Wiluna. As regards Ran-
dells, its chances of ever being anything but a loss to
the Government are considered remote, while as for
Wiluna, the Gwalia Consolidated gave the field up
as hopeless after proving by costly experiments that
the sulphides there contained mostly everything that
stood in the way of successful gold extraction.

Edna May Central (W.A.) is alleged to
be crushing things. A mill has been ordered and
preparations are being made for its erection. But
what about ore supplies? If the yarn that has
reached this office be true, the plant will soon chew
up all that there is at grass and in sight.
Boulder Perseverances (W.A.) suddenly
jumped up Is. the other day, and caused the sur-
prised local scrippers to scratch their heads and
wonder. Nothing of any consequence has been found
lately, but as this is just about the time that the
annual report gets “ ’Ome,” possibly some optim-
istic word or two in it is responsible for the rise. As
a profit-earner, the mine, like most of its Golden
Mile neighbors, is shrinking day by day.
* * * *
“A few more years shall roll” solemnly
remarked the acting-manager at the Boulder annual
picnic the other day, “and then, unless someone can
perform the miracle of getting the lode which went
into the Horseshoe to twist back again, up will go
the shutters and down Will come the blind.” This
is the most candid official statement of the position
that has yet been given. The latest official estimate
or ore reserves gives the property a life of three
years, but as the management has still a bit up its
sleeve, this period may safely be extended another
two years at least. After that, or perhaps long
before, a gradual dwindling in the gold production
will set in.
* * * *
Associated Northern’s latest annual state-
ment shows that after deducting £54,348 working
expenses a credit balance of £72,995 remains. Ad-
ministration costs, outlay on plant, depreciation and
sundry charges reduce this to £38,452, and with
£20,414 left over from the previous year added, there
is a total credit of £58,867. Dividends mop up
£35,000, leaving a balance of £23,867. During
the year the co. treated 18,160 tons of ore, including
17,963 tons raised by tributers, 5922 tons of pur-
chased ore and 32,276 tons of residues at its Kal-
goorlie (Iron Duke) lease and 97,790 tons of ore at
its Ora Banda (Victorious) mine. Negotiations for
leasing the El Refugio Mexican property on a
royalty basis as hinted in the previous annual report
were concluded some time back, but the lessee is
too frightened to start operations over there for fear
that if he gets any gold he will be throttled and
have it taken from him.
* * * *
Siberia Consols (W.A.) is reported to be
looking brighter, and it is about time it did. At
the flotation, Adelaide was led to believe that divi-
dends were looming in the distance, but all the co.
seems to have done in the interim is to look for
water, and ask the vendors to wait a bit longer for
the balance of purchase money. A bit of crosscut-
ting is now being done, some rich ore and a new
lode are alleged to have been struck Gwalia
Central —a co. viewed with great suspicion in London
- —announces a soz. crushing valued at approxi-
mately £l5OO from its leases at Leonora (W.A.).
Management says it is difficult to estimate the ton-
nage in sight, as the leader which contains all the
gold is very thin. It reckons on getting at least
another 4000 oz. from development. The market re-
fuses, however, to believe this or the addendum
that the mine is looking better than ever.
Promoters of Whittaker’s gold mining co.
at Holden’s Find (W.A.) did a wise thing in with-
drawing the prospectus until further development is
done on the property. Too many Westralian ventures
with nothing to recommend them but the word of one
or two irresponsible optimists have lived and died
in the last two or three years, and so far the local-
ity in which Whittaker’s is situated has not estab-
lished its claim to permanency. The Benjamin
George at Coolgardie is another show that ought to
have been kept back a little longer. In a place like
Coolgardie the fact that so many hundreds or thou-
sands of ounces of gold have been taken out, down
to such and such a level, and that the latest sam-
pling “has been attended with good results” is no
recommendation at all. Many a mine there has
possessed a rich shoot or two, and no more. Or else
the cost of finding and taking out the gold has
proved to have bet'll considerably ihdre than it is
worth-.
■*■**■*•
The big British New Guinea Development
Go., which threatened three or four years ago to be
nothing but a gigantic hot-air bubble, has some
hopes ahead of it now. On both the trading and the
agricultural sides, the management has vastly im-
proved. One of the numerous Cowleys, with solid
Queensland plantation and commercial experience
behind him, is in charge. The co. is, of course,
over-capitalised, and an absurdly large amount went
in underwriting and in paying for leases, etc. ; but if
there are not the profits to pay dividends on the
million or more, there should be enough to give a
return on something within reason. The co. holds
112,000 acres, which is far more than it can manage ;
and as it certainly will not be able to carry out
the improvement conditions in the prescribed tihie, it
is in danger of finding a lot of the country forfeited.
With this in mind, the clearing of land is being
pushed on, ind As this job is done the managers are
shifted and the areas turned over to overseers, whose
principal work is to keep the undergrowth down.
Cocoanuts (for copra) are the main crop so far.
There is far less outcry nowadays about labor. The
small planter has most trouble; and the B.NG. Co.
makes more than a pound of two in “selling” re-
cruits to him. The potential supplies of Papuan
labor are now pretty geperally recognised to be much
greater than was thought a few years ago. Up where
the Sjtrifckland has its source, three hundred miles
inland, a lake—the biggest in Papua—was discov-
ered only a few months ago; and in that quite
unexplored district there are, it is reported, thou-
sands of natives who, though at present only dis-
posed to put spears through any intruding white
man, are expected to earn dividends for him later
on. That has been the experience right through
Papua—the more disposed the nigger is to puncture
the white man when they first meet, the better the
laborer he makes when they get to know one another.
The Papuan Government, by the way, recently
established an agency at Challis House, Sydney) and
put it in charge of J. T. Bensted, who Whs formerly
Government storekeeper, and has had 14 years’ Varied
experience of the Possession. Tlie agency, besides
transacting the Government’s business doWn sttuth,
is available as an information bureau.

Gre&t Fit'Zroy people, who haven’t by any
means painted developments at the Laloki mine
(Papua) in too bright colors, are trying to get a
Variation of their agreement with the syndicate (in
32 shares) which owns the property. The co. has
paid £5OOO in exercise of the option, and the syn-
cate is to further get 2s. per ton royalty on not less
than 25,000 tons a year and to retain an eighth in-
terest. The co. doesn’t like the royalty, probably
because it thinks that English investors, if approached
with a company prospectus, would turn it down on
this account. A straight-out purchase is now sought.
But the vendors will only talk big figures, for,
though the bodies are probably lenticular, there is
a very big tonnage assured, and big tonnage means
big royalties. A little copper ore is still being
shipped from the Astrolabe field ; but costs of cart-
age, handling and transport to smelters are so heavy
that nothing on a big scale will be done till there
is rail to Port Moresby; and that work will take a
couple of years to finish, though the distance is only
a few miles, and the track not difficult.
* * * *
It is a pity somebody with a bit of mOnhy
and a lot of organising poWet doesn’t take the
Kulamadau in hand. As far As exploration has gone
it is the best goldmine that Papua , has produced
(it is on Woodlark Island, just off the mainland).
But it has dong rtb gobd for anybody, except the
machinery merchants; and the machinery merchants
might eVeii now sell the co. a few things with advan-
tage. Long ago a slimes plant should have been
installed; but because there was no slimes plant
and no money to buy one, the slimes were allowed
to go down the river, and, though rich, are appar-
ently irrecoverable. A start has only just been
made to save the current production. There are very
fair ore-reserves in the mine, too. Apart from the
lack of money, the principal trouble has been the
constant chopping and changing of managers. The
mine takes some learning, especially as there are
no facilities for continual sampling; but it is very
rare that a manager has lasted long enough to know
the tricks of the property. The market value has
dwindled until the mine stands for far less money
than the equipment has cost, and there are poor
prospects of dividends in spite of the good ore
reserves. Charters Towers is the principal holder
of the shares.

“Machete” : Re my par about the Yodda
Valley Dredging co. (B. 5/3/T4), “a wire suspen-
sion bridge crossing the river” refers to the Kumusi
river and not the Mamba, as the context would lead
one to suppose.

“When in trouble blame the plant,” is evi-
dently what Mount Morgan works on, for the old
plant, now that it is to be abandoned for the new
one authorised by the present regime, regularly comes
in for a solid share of blame if things don’t go too
smoothly. But, after all, the plant is still compara-
tively new. However, until it finally goes out of
commission, more trouble is promised by the manage-
ment. And if trouble ends there, this paper will be
surprised. The first section of the new power plant
is expected to be running within a few weeks. The
last four-weekly output of ore was a paltry 17,089
tons from Mount Morgan, and 5421 tons from Many
Peaks, producing 499 tons of blister copper and
61660 z. of gold. As the flux-ore contained 63 tons
of copper, the Mount Morgan ore averaged about 21
p.c. copper (yield). This grade is an unpleasant, though
necessary, change from the high extractions of recent
years. After the heavy strain the mine apparently is
unable to oblige any longer, even for the short time
until the new plant gets going fully. When that hap-
pens the next question upon which an answer would
be welcomed is how much 24 p.c. copper ore there
would be to smelt. The last half-yearly report men-
tioned that ore exceeding 52 p.c. silica would not be
smelted while report from other sources does not
mention that the Mount Morgan ore is getting any
less siliceous as time goes on. Meanwhile, the usual
shilling dividend is being adhered to.
* * * *
St. Mungo Copper (Cloncurry, Q.) is the
first copper show in the Cloncurry district to return
in dividends the whole of the paid-up capital.
Charters Towers speculators took a rational view of
the mine when they started the little show with
a capital of £5OOO in 10,000 shares of 10s. each,
since converted into 40,000 of 2s. 6d. The total
amount paid in dividends is £BOOO, equal to 4s. per
2s. 6d. share. Sales on the Towers have ranged from
3s. 6d. to 4s. cum dividends, for although the mine
has done fairly well since it was floated in 1909, its
lateral ore-deposits in the shallow levels have been
depleted, and it will certainly take much development
to root out as much ore below No. 4 as was taken
out above it.
* * * *
Chillagoe asks for another 6d. call by
March 24, making shares paid to 10s—but the posi-
tion, with debenture interest coming due, and, the
smelting works closed down, will be precarious.,
* * * *
Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) passes the
quarterly dividend. The shadow of this was cast
over the last half-yearly report (B. 4/12/’l3), and
has gradually thickened with the droop in the price
of copper. Last month completed another half-year
and accounts should shortly make their appearance.
It is stated that the working profit was £85,690,
which is higher than before, but £20,000 worth of
debentures have to be redeemed shortly, rhe sticKy
stuff in the ointment, however, is principally the
capital ependiture that is being incurred in connec-
tion with the co.’s ambitious projects. The Macgregor
tramway has now run into £51,000, of which
£19,000 was spent in the past six months. Develop-
ment and equipment at the Hampden, Duchess, Treke-
lano, Answer, Pindora and Macgregor mines mopped
up another £26,000. And the end is not yet.
* * * *
That damp proposition, the Tasmanian
Gold, is wet enough to douse any glimmer of ordinary
optimism, but that sort of optimism apparently does
not belong to those local inhabitants who have
shares in the co. These people met at Launceston
and passed a resolution requesting tbb Loridori mrec-
tors not to close tlbwft the iniHe until, further expert
advice was 'obtained. They also warit local control ot
the management, and are prepared to take Steps, to
have their want supplied. Doubtless who nas
long tried to be as oblivious as possible to the de-
clining output and increased costs, would riot be
avetse tb discussing the matter of transference on
suitable terms.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, Mabch 16, 1914.
My Beak Arini,—
The Cornstalk who wanders through a
Victorian heat wave of two, on holiday bent,
is impressed by the reserve with which the
average Victorian receives hostile criticism
about a day that basks amid the glow of 103°
in the shade of an ice-chest. No one should
speak of f-ope to the man whose grand-
father was hanged, and when the Victorian
tveathet has been hhng extra high it is best
to change the subject. Still; if the . subject
must transpire, it is pleasing to find the
native in a hopeful mood. He is a lesson
in optimism, and meets the blaze of circum-
stances with a sunburnt nose, and a parched
tongue, and an undaunted belief in coolness
to come. Sydney, with its quick-change cli-
mate and generally breezy evenings, has
much to learn in the matter of less grumb-
ling, from Melbourne philosophy and
Micawber-like faith in the morrow.
Noted during a recent holiday at Queens-
cliff (Vic.) that it’s one of the neatest
towns of its size the average tourist is likely
to meet in a month’s travels. Any person
who would wilfully throw a tag of paper-
tin cold blood) on the main streets, which
are wide enough to strike awe into the
hearts of small children who amble across
them to the sands, would probably be ar-
rested for high treason. Some in-
visible housemaid must sweep these long,
white highways with a whirlwind, before
dawn, and whisk the rubbish (if any) into
the sea that breaks on miles of creamy
beaches.
Jtist hoW the air hereabouts throbs with
toWU-pianUing schemes. Queenscliff, with
its impressive esplanade, wide streets and
shady park that flirts With the sands, is a
tine sample of what Australians can do,
when they seriously lay out a seaside re-
sort This breezy seascape lives on fish and
tourists. The latter are out of season in
winter. The town suffers with Christian
fortitude the indignity of having its trim
park untidied by picnic parties from Mel-
bourne, once or twice a week in summer.
It collects much cash for hard and soft
drinks from the visitors. The excursion
steamer whisks them up the bay before
nightfall, and the park ranger collects their
paper ends before the sea-gulls have time to
gossip about the contents.
The anti-compulsory trainee, usually an
unwashed, lean-against-any-old-post type of
youth, when he arrives at Queenscliff, is
promptly marched off to Swan Island after
he has reported himself to the military
authorities. He. is comfortably housed in
good bell tents, is well fed, is compelled to
wash himself, and his religious convictions
(in the matter of clinging to his non-ablu-
tionary habits) are not treated seriously.
Some of the better type of lads have shirked
a few drills, as a schoolboy wags the three
IPs, and don’t like to face the area officer.
So they swell the percentage of anti-com-
pulse Victorians at Swan Island. Usually
the number is 60 —not a wildly
alarming percentage. Saw a squad of these
young Hopefuls drill, after a few weeks
detention at the fort. A brighter and more
biddable lot of boys would be hard to find.
The veteran ex-Senator Simon Fraser
(Vic.) is 82, not out. His brisk, active
figure, bustling along the Queenscliff esplan-
ade, was a kind of moral tonic to young
fellows of 60, who imagined they were grow-
ing stiff in the joints. He trips off to Eng-
land this month.
Artist Frances Hodgkins writes from
Capri that the rocks are pink, the sea is
blue, the grottoes are indescribable, and the
weather too mixed for much painting out of
doors. The Maorilander was packing up
her palette for Siena when she posted hex-
remarks.
Edgar Downes married the attractive
Braidwood girl, Isabel Maddrell, the other
day. He will settle down with bis bride at
Brownlow Hill estate, near Camden, after
the honeymoon in the Apple Isle. Brown-
low Hill homestead is one of the ancient roof-
trees in the old Cow-pasture district, and it
wears a deep verandah that looks like a
thoughtful eyebrow overhanging its shady
windows. Mixed farming in tbe old days
was an ax-duous task, when roads were rough
and ti-ansit subject to sudden accident. One
of the Macleay family, I fancy, had a lowing
herd on the Brownlow Hill when the world
was much younger. A friend asked him
how he got his butter to Sydney in the hot
weather. “Oh, Quite easily,” said he; “it
runs all the way.”
Mrs. W. A. Holman is farewelling Mrs.
Martin Donohoe and Mrs. Percy Hunter this
week. The dingy Macquarie-street political
pile will be the scene of this Pekoe party,
which occurs before you tear the present
missive open.
Miss Betty Waldron is packing up her
trousseau for East Africa, where large herds
of mosquitoes graze on swamps, and the nig-
ger obscures the view. Chaperoned by
mamma (who is a daughter of the late
George I)ibbs) the girl sets out early in
April. The groom-expectant is named Reich-
enbach.
A daughter of Justice Sly is alleged, on
good authority, to have plighted her word to
say “I will” (at some future date) to a son
of the late Dr. Caleb Terry. He was the
medico who made a pile in successful specu-
lation, and eventually became one of the
financial magnates of the Smith’s big print-
ing firm in this town. Miss Eileen’s papa,
Dr. Richard Sly, took the legal ermine about
six years ago.
Passed out, at a sound old age, the other
week, Mr. L. J. Paling, one of the directors
of the music firm of that name.
Dr. Odillo Maher is cooling his heels on
the showy pate of Kosciusko this week.
The Kenneth Smiths, of Mosman, will trip
up to the same airy summit on March 21.
G. T. Dawson, of Texas (Q.), and party
are going to angle in the waters up that
way towards the end of the present month,
ihe close season begins on April 30. After
that date the finny tribe will not be at
home to visitors, and it will be no use
leaving your card.
Business man McMahon and his Missis,
°* Carathool (N.S.W.), have bustled off to
sniff the sulphur crop at Rotorua, in Maori-
land. Thence they drift down the Wan-
ganui with an occasional bump over the
rapids, and pass on to Wellington. The
McMahons are going south, to have a look
at the West Coast, where the departed glit-
ter of Hokitika is full of memories of the
late Dick Seddon and other ancient notabili-
ties. The Maoriland West Coast made a
history in the roaring days, when the
old Welcome mine, at Boatman’s Creek,
roared as much as 20oz. to the ton in spots,
and other ancient giants were even louder.
It is a quiet place nowadays.
Robert McC. Anderson, who cultivates the
habit of growing younger, is packing up for
a trip through the United States with Mrs.
Me, who has a ’Varsity degree hidden about
her person. The Anderson home at Lind-
heJd, and the juveniles of the clan, will be
carefully tended by a discreet dame who
has come from Bananaland for the purpose.
Travelled over from Melbourne the other
day, in the same train as Mawson, of Ade-
laide and the Antarctic, and didn’t know it
till a cheering crowd surrounded the wand-
erer with impressive handshakes. Mawson
is a tall, youngish man, almost as lean as a
r eed. He sllo 'YS outward signs of the strain
of 30 days solitude on the ice, and the loss
of his companions, Ninnis and Mertz. He
turned a wan smiie on a stack of congratu-
lations, and drifted slowly along the Central
Station, like a man who had returned from
a comnrehensive funeral. I suppose the
Antarctic craze is worth the valuable lives
that are now wrapped in a soft mantle of
eternal snow ? I can only suppose so, as the
jiublic keeps on paying for this costly gamble
in ice-packs.
A Sydney person of journalistic import-
ance who refuses to have his name men-
tioned is holidaying in Maoriland with some
of his family. After tapping the thin
crust round Geyserland in the North
Island, they are going south, via the
Wanganui River, where nature is dressed
in a green frock of moss, and her
skirts of foliage and her corset of
rock are very high and perpendicular on
either shore. A possible feature of the
South Island campaign will be the notable
walk from the head of Te Anau to Milford
Sound.
This walk of 33 miles is so crowded with
scenery that the traveller is liable to arrive
at the last stage with a crick in his neck
and a severe squint. The scenery is piled
up in mountains on either side of the narrow
foot track. Hence the pedestrian who wants
to get his money’s worth of pinnacles has to
stare both ways at once. He is looking up-
stairs, as it were, all the time, so he ac-
quires a fractured or dislocated expression
about his frontispiece long before he reaches
the last gap in the journey. Before starting,
the traveller takes in a ballast of M.L. hare
soup at the Glade House. This steadies
any desire to climb an avalanche or fall off
a mountain peak. The trip is broken up
into three heats of about 11 miles each.
At the end of the tramp the traveller is
content to take a boat. The middle heat is
a high ridge, and when the snow is lying
heavily upon it the sinner totters in slippery
places. At the top one views a sort of Meeting
of the Waters. One stream starts out for El
Dorado. One leaves for the Back of the
South Wind. And another flows down to
Hy-Brasil, and the land of Prester John,
and Golconda, and the valley where the
1.0. U. grows.
The George Sly menage is booked for
flight to the other side, and rushes its lug-
gage aboard a mail-boat at an early date.
Alfred Cooper, who usually hangs up his
knighthood on some handy peg in Ossemsley
Manor (Hants, Eng.), stepped off the
Orama last week in this port. He is chair-
man of Ridgways Ltd., a big commercial
concern on the other side. He caught his
knighthood immediately after the South
African squabble, for financing a private
military hospital at Surbiton. The fact
that it was used as an understudy to the
then Princess of Wales’s hospital ship
brought the Surbiton affair into the glare of
royal limelight.
Artist B. S. Minns talks of coming to
Australia some time this year, D.V. and
other business permitting. If he carries out
this notion, he wants to land at Darwin, and
sketch the Northern Territory native in his
Sunday morning smile. Pictures of the
scenery at the top of the Australian map
would be included in the Minns’ itinerary.
Dorothy Whiting, who appeared here in a
minor part with the last Oscar. Asche team,
is now leaping or gliding to the front in
London vaudeville. She is a pretty Austra-
lian girl, which is greatly to her credit, of
course. Her people, who are more or less
rooted to Victorian soil, are in snug circum-
stances. This is also helpful to a damsel
with footlight aspirations. “A Ward Out of
Chancery” was the piece in which Australian
Dorothy was pushing herself to the front.
P. D. McCormick, who wrote the music,
‘Advance, Australia Fair,” had his 80th
the other day. A while ago the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment gave the veteran a keepsake in the
shape of £lOO. “Advance, Australia Fair”
threatens to live as a national lyric. It has
a catchy, melodious rhythm, though there’s a
whiff of the “Death of Nelson” somewhere
about its live body.
That fine, strapping young South Austra-
lian, Peter Dawson, whose voice resounded
through an Ada Crossley tour hereabouts, is
bringing out his own concert co. Peter,
who was growing a very juvenile moustache
when he was last here, must be about 30
summers young by this time. Eileen Boyd,
who was a child mummer with Australian
companies till she let the tuck out of her
frocks, is bringing home a large contralto
voice. She is in the Peter Dawson com-
bination.
Tenor Cecil Sherwood banked a fat cheque
as the profits of his farewell chirrup in the
Town Hall.
Tenor Paul Dufault, recently interviewed
in Maoriland, discoursed on the charms of
the simple life. Mostly, of course, it is the
people who are forced by stress of cash to
actually live the simple life on half-a-bean
a day, who want to live the purple and fine
linen and roast duck and champagne exist-
ence. Still, it’s a pity the French-Canadian
song-bird didn’t visit Sydney during the
meat strike. He could have set a beautiful
example by warbling a hymn of thanksgiv-
ing over the dish of green herbs which the
distracted housekeeper could have given him
in any palatial cot —that meal of boiled
grass which Solomon commended though he
didn t eat it himself. A pyramid of the
shells of last week’s eggs was another fancv
dish, served up with sauce a la chicken
bone, that no apostle of Plain Living should
have missed.
An Australian abroad writes from the
Thames village. He says: “I went to the
Coliseum to see a show labelled ‘Wild Aus-
tralia.’ The London papers had been giving
this turn melted-butter notices, and advised
everyone who could (time and cash permit-
ting) to start right away and see ‘a graphic
picture of life in Australia.’ So I went
with the rest. It was very wild, but it
wasn’t Australia, though the average Cock-
ney seemed to think it a very fine picture
of colonial life.’ Stockwhips that cracked
like rifles, and the lassooing of wild beasts,
etc., in the appropriate costume in which the
newchum of half a century ago used to be
caricatured, were the main features of the
show. There were no snakes climbing lamp-
posts and no dingoes tearing the Australian
settler, limb from limb. Otherwise nothing
but the facts of life in our sunny clime—•
was missing. Various members of my
boarding-house who went were greatly im-
When I told them that the average
Australian girl was fond of tennis, fancy
work or golf, my remarks were received with
incredulous silence. They preferred the
young lady who broke in buck-jumpers and
lassooed cattle as her daily recreation.”
• Mrs Slapoffski looks very fit (don’t make
it tat, tor heaven’s sake) and well since her
return to Sydney from the Fog. She is
engaged by the Tait firm for some concerts
in Melbourne.
Though young servants are a more up-to-
date topic than old masters, a Paris corres-
pondent remarks: “Old masters show us that
the picture hat was the correct thing to
6a orJTi th a low - cllt corsage, but the maid of
the 20th century prefers a tiny hat of black
velvet with a shaped crown—this hat closelv
resembles a man’s b0w1er.”.... The yash-
mak, a fearsome new style veil, is one of the
few things that no old master (except of the
Turkey species) has been accused of invent-
makes a small, lacey beard, and
climbs up to the wearer’s eyes. Fashion is
so crazy this season that the fashionable
dame is likely to look like a cross between an
aeroplane, a Turkish “Light of the Harem”
and a Persian ballet. The unfashionable
will be able to sniff their disapproval from
the altitudes of the penny tram.
A hurried glimpse of autumn millinery
prepares one for the worst. I have resolved
to retire to the back of the wilderness till
the storm is over. Hats appear to hover on
the aeroplane margin. Some of them are
eagles and the rest are condors. Trimmings
soar skyward, or flap out over one ear like
the wing of some half-grown bi-plane. They
are on the small side as to brim, hut the
Leamng-Tower-of-Pisa variety of feathers
that bobs a couple of feet over the heads of
the Truly Smart, are reminders of barbaric
woman when the killing season had been
good.
A recent number of the English Review
publishes some hair-raising details of the
terrors of forcible feeding as applied to
Suffragettes. That notable militant, Mary
Richardson, is amongst the fed who de-
nounces the violence of this method of coping
with the hunger-strikers.
Humanity is shocked at the cruelty in-
volved in the forcible-feeding scheme. Would
it be more shocked if the militants were
allowed to starve themselves to death in
Holloway? This is the acute question of the
hour. Up to a certain point, the Suffragette
earned a good deal of sympathy from politi-
cal opponents, as a sporting person who was
beating a big drum and attracting the world’s
attention to her cause in many quaint and
daring ways. To-day (he leaders of the mili-
tants have developed a frenzy of destruction,
and descended into an abyss of window-smash
that hurls the forcible-food torture into un-
pleasant; prominence. Suffragette Lenton ad-
mits that in the middle of her own stomach-
tube anguish, one of the doctors asked her
would she not take some food naturally. She
replied “Of course not!” and remarks, “They
went on with their game.” So the court of
public opinion has yet to decide should the
Suffragette be allowed to continue her game
and starve herself to death in her own way.
A press report of the Women’s “Liberal”
League council meeting the other day pal-
pitates with notices of resolutions which are
to_ be hurled at the august assembly that
will meet later in the year. It must be
particularly pleasing to Senators Millen,
Oakes, and Mining Gould, to know that the
Women’s Liberal League endorses their
election. After the dust of every election
has been laid and the combatants have
affixed sticking plaster to their bruises and
discolorations, the spectator who is fond of
arithmetic can try to solve the following
problem : How many voters are actually
captured by the average political female’s
league? Thousands of resolutions are fired
off annually. What do they hit, anyhow?
Yours sincerely,
VANDORIAN.
“Melb”: Fitzroy used to have the Mon-
tague and Capulet Cricket Clubs. More
serious are the Rats Push and Primrose
Push, in that suburb. They had a battle in
Webb-street on March 10. About 150 en-
gaged on each side, with pieces of iron pipe,
bicycle chains, sticks, stones, and every
weapon that could be devised. An
extraordinary collection of missiles was left
on the ground when the combatants de-
camped, at the approach of nine policemen,
hurriedly gathered. The capture of a few
enabled the police to issue about 50 sum-
monses, a number of them being for the
Children’s Courts! The Melbourne infant
had been out with his axe. The row origin-
ated through a girl, aged 14, of the Prim-
rose Push, going out walking with a boy of
the Rats. The news of this defection or
treason spread in Spats’ paper-bag factory
where she toils along with both Primroses
and Rats. All the girls struck and de-
manded that she should be sacked. The
manager threw her out in the interests of
peace. Her brother then summoned the
Primroses to meet in a de-licensed hotel, and
consider the full horror of the situation.
The Rats got the word, and were also
present. After that the whole conversation
consisted of bricks.
Sydney’s Royal Hotel, which has just been
sentenced to an unfermented and spiritless
existence for some time to come, is full of
the ghosts of N. S. Wales history. Here the
anti-transportation movement was hatched,
and, when Wentworth and the other red-
raggers of the period went out of one door,
the pastoral nabobs who wanted cheap labor
entered cursing by another. It was
here that meetings were held for the
erection of the monument to Governor
Bourke, and from this ancient drinkery
10,000 people, “the largest procession
so far held in Australia,” marched to the Do-
main to see the statue unveiled. The loosely-
attached rooms were the home of the early
drama. Globe-trotters of the time put in
print on their return to England stories of
the antics of actors on the stage and the
deftness of pickpockets among the audience.
It was at one time the place for welcomes
and farewells of a public sort. If all the
politicians, artists and beauty actors who
have got tight within its hospitable precincts
were laid in single file, head to heel, the line
would stretch from Manly Beach, to the North
Pole.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 16, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Explorer Mawson has been staying at the
Delprat home in South Yarra and endeavor-
ing to dodge interviews so as to get time to
gossip with fiancee Paquita. They have
heaps to say after 2$ years separation with-
out a daily post. Paquita is a handsome
amazon of a girl who was christened long
before her parents knew how big she in-
tehded to gloW. She has fi fine toite, which
She hses occasionally. An artist sistet iii
London has startled the old town with some
noticeably good work,, and another brilliant
sister is a pianiste in Vienna. The Delprat
drawing-room is full of banners, and cham-
pionship belts won by the piano genius, so
there is no room there for the dog dear
Douglas brought back from the Antarctic.
It is a cross between a lion and a sheep-dog,
with the merest dash of tiger, and it pants
distractedly on the lawn and tries to pass
itself off as a whale. I suppose the Maw-
sons will give an Antarctic dinner some
night and feed their guests on it.
Frank Carse and Eileen Brett were
married as threatened on March 4. The
proceedings, which were of the usual sort,
have been fully recorded elsewhere, so I con-
tent myself with merely mentioning the fact.
.Isidore Kosminsky, who possesses a store
of ciiHous knowledge, is iihnoyed by the
anachronisms perpetrated by the Theatre
Royal folk in “Joseph and His Brethren.”
Isidore wants to take the great crystal
mounted on the bronze snake’s neck away
from Ethsl Warwick and throw it into the
dustbox. The Egyptians of that date gazed
at a flat black disc before they told one
another lies. Then the interlaced triangles
are before their time, and the erudite modern
Hebrew critic scoffs at the elaborate branched
candlesticks which are introduced into the
Canaan shepherd’s shanty. That sort of
thing only began in the days of Exodus.
Florence Rodwav the tall, smiling girl-
artist who specialises in pastels, was in Mel-
bourne last week, but talked of returning to
Sydney, where, she does all her work. She
had been holidaying in Hobart —her birth-
place, She intends to Show some of hef firt
in Melbourne. during August; ffnd a few
charming specimens are already in town. A
portrait of Isidore Kosininsky’s son is a
cleyer bit of work, and Henry Lawson’s
children almost seem ready to step out of
theii* frames. Last year Florence came over
td ‘‘Jiang” fob,th.G Associated Artists at the
big barn in Carlton Gardens; but the Art
section of tbe show in the balcony was gener-
ally ignored when there were motor-cars and
lollies to look, at, and the only visitors were
a few lost beings. Her recollections of the
days in the neglected balcony are sad indeed.
She felt like a nurse sitting up all night in
charge of a case of sleeping sickness.
Judge Johnston and his son have been
Queensclifling along with the Judge’s sister,
Mrs. Walter. The Queenscliff tavern, now
30 years old, has always been run by the
two little dames Gosford, and almost the
same people have been summering there dur-
ing the whole term. Amongst recent con-
gregations were Mrs. Gardiner, of Geelong,
her daughter, Mrs. Bingley., and a tribe of
Bingley youngsters and maids, all of whom
motored down from the family sheep studio.
The squatter himself oils down whenever
he can spare the time from cleaning tbe
wethers’ teeth and tying the lambs’ wool up
in blue ribbon. Mrs. Eddie, from Winchel-
sea, was another who attended the seaside
devotions, which consist principally of bath-
ing and golf.
The Victorian Festival Choir, which used
to be conducted by the late E’red Beard, is
now waved into harmonious order by one
Bailey, who is large and bald, and conducts
in an open-armed manner as if he could
simply hug all the ladies taking part. Last
week the Choir gave a concert in the Masonic
Hall, with a full supply of vice-regal pomp
turned on. The white-robed singers sat aloft
in the balcohy like angels, and looked coldly
down on the audience sitting behind and
aroUnd food-heaped tables. The guests Were
welcomed by John Madden and Mrs. Bailey,
and passed along to their chairs. “When do
we eat all this?” asked one stout lady in a
large Whisper, after she had gazed oti some
grapes till her mouth watered. “The Gover-
nor’s not here yet,” remarked a frigid iady,
who had dined carefully in. three volumes
about half an hour previously. When
Governor Stanley blew in he was observed
to have lost his famous smile. But, by way
of recompense, he was covered with stars,
comets and ordinary fireworks, while his
pretty little lady looked as if she had just
come up from the depths of the sea in a
beautiful, skimpy, green dress and a green
and brown weedy shawl. Madden, with his
recently-shaved lip-whiskers sprouting again,
smiled them into their places. He was alone,
the Madden dame being too exhausted after
the wedding excitement. The Choir angels
got a beautiful lullaby off their chests, and
the. vice-regal gang sank into their special
chairs placed adjacent to their special tables.
A terrified waitress, temporarily paralysed
and suffocated with loyalty, dropped a heavy
metal tray, and the crashing echoes filled the
place. When they had died away and the
waitress had fled into exterior darkness
carrying the tray with her, the business of the
evening began. Everybody started eating
and talking at a great rate, and listened to
the singing when there, was nothing else to
do. Stead, of the Review of Etc., brought
his pretty auburn-haired wife, whose paddy-
green clothing was delightful to witness.
Pianist Goll and his wife looked soulful
while the music was on —but then it is their
business. The bare backs and shoulders
amounted to about three acres, and when all
wiis over the melted audience poured out and
the waiting cMuffehfs ladled the. right quan-
tities into their cars and drove off hofiiG.
Maggie Niall-Burnham, after a short cdfifi-
try honeymoon, raced back with her bride-
groom to get the mailboat for India, where
liis regiment awaits him. Mrs. Stewart Bal-
main gave a great luncheon party at the
Oriental in honor of the departing one. The
Barttelots were there, and the Caseys, who
had lent their house for the wedding, were
on hand with their teeth sharpened. The
Pursey Chirnsides sat round the delphiniums,
and Armytages and Millers and Landales
(Notice, dear, how I write about these people
in masses?) admired the cactus dahlias that
swamped their food. (Did you ever taste
food swamped by dahlias?) Mrs. Ruby-
Madden-Osborne displayed her engaging dim-
ples which have never shown a suspicion of
turning into lines or furrows. Mrs. J. M.
Niall followed oh the gqod work of feeding
by giving a dinner to the hofleymootlers at
the Savoy the same evening, and Mrs. E'red
Fairbairn asked all feet to a dance after the
dinner to further cheer up the newly-weds.
Spurr, the sensational leader of the Col-
lins-street Baptists, has obviously made way
for a more showy shepherd. A monster
placard outside the temple to attract the
attention of Saturday-nighters reads, “To-
morrow morning. New Parson. T : E-RTJTH.”
They all profe'ss to be deliverers of the
Terutii, as Mr. Chadband pronounced it.
Dr. Isabel Ormiston, of the Apple Isle, is
making tracks through here on her way to
England for holiday. On her Why thither
she will look in at Rome for the big Con-
gress of Women, where she will represent
Tffsmahid on the Standing Committee of
Public Health.
The Denman lady has roofed ih the Mag-
pie Ladies Orchestra with her patronage,
and no social rain will ever damp its hair,
The orchestra, which has been assembled by
Mrs. Summerliayes and daughter Gertrude,
is composed of pretty girls, all of whom are
good players (this is reassuring!) and they
look cute and daihty in their black and
white . dresses, Gertrude Shmmerhayes is
first violin. The Magpies played with success
at the Town Hall last week fof tbe Women’s
National League performance. Several
dames in the heavyweight division put up
their lorgnettes and murmured, “Are they
really local girls—they play so well!" I felt
like drawing out my telescope, levelling it at
them and droning, “Are they really local
fowls —they look so respectable .” Some day
I will rise and hurl my umbrella javelin-wise
at these demented old crows. The Magpies’
next large job is at the Austral Salon, at the
end of the week.
The genial Hossen-Loff, the autocrat of
the Savoy supper table, is about to start
on a European trip to collect ideas and
other things for a new caf<§, to be run on
Casino lines, which he intends opening on a
site near Prince’s Bridge, now occupied by
Spencer’s pictures and Wirth’s Park.
“Hossey” was farewelled the other night by
about 200 of the regular Savoy congregation.
A Tango, service, which lasted till far into
the morning, was conducted by young man
Salenger, of the Tivoli, assisted by Gwen
Burroughs. Before the gathering broke up
to get its morning cup of tea in its own
home, several farewell speeches were per-
petrated, and Jews and Gentiles joined in
singing “Auld Lang Hie.”
The wedding of Guy Madden and Dorry
McEvoy was as noisy as these quiet func-
tions usually are, and the exact details were
promptly published in the papers that attend
to these things. It is not expected that the
peace of Europe will be disturbed by the
alliance of the two houses—or boarding-
houses. Every soul—lost or otherwise—re-
siding in Cliveden Flats was bidden to the
reception. (The makeshift altar was erected
in the lounge, so something had to be done
to placate the lodgers). I think Guy wore
his Scotch ballet skirt for the ceremony, but
cannot be certain because he was hidden in
the sea of feminine millinery. Bride Dorry,
although only a little girl, carried a heavy
load of material and pearls. She had Mary
Stuart-Murray and small Geoff McEvoy to
carry her train, whilst Aileen McEvoy and
Grace Byron-Moore, the grown up attend-
ants, sailed along in pink clouds of tulle.
Mrs. McEvoy, in ivory white, and the Mad-
den dame, in pearl grey, hovered over a
raging ocean of fine feathers. The Frank
Maddens came in full splendor, and Lesly
Madden was all grey, like a British warship.
Mrs. Pat Osborne, bridegroom Guy’s favor-
ite sister, was a visioii iii blue. The related
Rowans were also on hand, and Gaud Mayor
Hennessy, likewise Chamberlain Nevill.
Mrs. Rubber Edwards prooelled a nice dress
through the crush, and Mrs. Tony Hordern
finished a poem in duds with a double rope
of magnificent pearls. The Grey-Smiths, the
Howard Smiths, the Isaacs and the Kellys
had their very best trappings on. (Nowa-
days very few people wear their gardening
clothes to a society function.)
The daughter of Somebody and Mrs. Some-
body lately went off t-> Maoriland for a trip.
She came back “engaged,” but without the
man. Inquisitive friends were informed that
he was a Scotchman of wealth and pedigree
(brilliant details supplied), who happened to
be touring Maoriland at the same time. He
had bolted off to the ancestral castle at Glen
Matchki.fi to smash the news to his father,
the aged Edfl of Haggis, and his Uncle, Sir
Andrew Brose, find make preparations for
the alliance. The fiancde collected a maim
moth trousseau, as well as plenty of con-
gratulations, and was pelted with many
hardware presents prior to her departure.
After the fuss was over, the sober facts came
to light. The girl’s relations had tried their
derndest to break the engagement, but, find-
ing her bent on having her own way, had
painted a poor, honest working man in
peacock’s colors, and invented Glen Mutchkin
and the ancient Earl of Haggis.
Max Pirani- —his 14-year-old eyes are
already in specs.—went up to Federal
Government House one morning last week
and played the piano to Lady Denman.
Chamberlain Nevill, Help Pollok and several
other people whose opinions about the youth’s
Compositions were worth as much as they
would fetch in the open market. Max’s
benefit concert will be made up of the best
local talent obtainable. Nan O’Hara, having
done all her bridesmaiding jobs, has joined
the secretary’s detachment, and is working
hard for the prodigy—a black-haired kid who
always turns up at concerts with a musical
tome under his arm and wanders through
the audience in intervals with the self-
conscious air of a pretty flapper.
The Overseas Club has sent out glorified
liand-painted invitation cards for a competi-
tive eUchre party, in the Training College
Hall, on Saturday, March 21st. Somehow
it sounds most instructive.
Explorer Mawson is to be married to
Paquita Delprat in Melbourne, on March
31. Paquita’s father is general-manager of
the Broken Hill Proprietary Mine, but it
doesn’t hurt him, and he isn’t expected to
forbid the banns.
The plumes of a young Social duchess
stood on end one night at the Palais de
Danse, when the son of a trusted menial
approached her with a threepenny bit and a
request to darnce with him.
From “Rosna,” in London :
At the Three Arts Club ball at Covent Garden the
other eVe several doughty souls indulged in Futurist
frocking. To carry out the idea, you must wear puce
hair, or, if you like it better, emerald green. One
sweet little thing wore a suit of brilliant vermilion,
with fur anklets, vermilion hair and a large purple
feather tethered to her futurist brow. Another sported
check trousers and jerkin, purple belt and hair worn
in a wild purple mop. Also, some were said to have
striped brains, but I have no sure evidence on this
point.
The Alawa Buchanans’ St. Kilda house
will be occupied during their absence by the
Edwin James matron, who, with her wid-
owed daughter, Mrs. Neill, is returning from
England. The elder daughter is married to
her cousin, Bob Molesworth, who squats
prosperously in the dear old Western Dis-
trict.
The clever Btisst boys keep on harvesting
laurels and cash and cabling home to mother
about it. Victor Bfisst has just been ap-
pointed sole solo pianist for life (it sounds
like a sentence, but I think I’ve got it right)
at Antwerp, in the place of Raoul Pugno,
who is now playing a celestial piano
amongst the stars.
Mrs. Flinn, who, for artistic purposes,
keeps her maiden name of Clara Southern,
is showing some canvas and paint in the
Athenaeum. Climbers who managed to get
up the stairs on opening day were well
rewarded, for the collection was cool and
restful, and eminently suitable for a hot
spell. The visitors flopped gratefully into
easy chairs set for them, and gazed at
wavy waterscapes and shadowy scenes among
the hills.
On the same afternoon, Bernard’s started
a show of paintings by English artists. Lady
Stanley, a white-muslin vision peeping from
under a cherry hat, strolled in, followed by
Help Wilson in tropical white duds and
carrying an immense parcel. The show people
hurriedly wondered if they could find a band
to blow a bar or so of “Gor’save,” and bowed
the vice-regal visitors toward the stairs.
However, her Ex. managed to escape grace-
fully from the reception committee and get
back to the everyday counter downstairs.
There the Help planked down the parcel and
said he wanted frames at two-and-fivepence-
ha’penny, or something, for pictures of the
Stanley youngsters.
Squatter Molesworth Green, of Grey-
stones, who is 88 years young, was tendered
a dinner the other night at the Melbourne
Club, of which institution he is now the
oldest member available. The brisk young
gentleman, in returning thanks, said he had
been tendered a dinner when he joined the
club ’way back in ’4B, because he was then
the youngest member admitted. He has out-
lasted every clubmate who had Jolly-Good-
Fellowed in mutton-chop whiskers on that
faraway night. But this survivor of a
bygone age does not call himself old. He
is still straight and spry, and dodges about his
Bacchus Marsh estate behind spirited horses
which he drives himself. He settled at
Bacchus Marsh in ’42. An uncle owned
Greystones first, and then squatter Moles-
worth carried it on. It is a pioneer squat-
tocratic palace. Most of the rich squatters
built country palaces on their runs to re-
place the original humble but
the Molesworth house is the old shack.
It is a huge bluestone building with walls
several feet thick, and the busiest part of it
is the old man’s “workshop,” as he calls hi.-
library-office.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
“Loyalty” on its mettle is a weirdly won
drous foolishness. Because the Labor-mem-
ber mayor of Richmond (Melb.) was knowr
to be averse to introducing “Gorsave” at
civic functions, one of the rate-collectors for
the council got up and sang the Hanthem
all on his own at a Richmond Schools Pic-
nic, where the “disloyal” mayor was making
himself pleasant, and, moreover, was paying
the fares of the kiddies. The poor rate-
collector fell in most absurdly. It had not
been the rule of late years to propose any
toasts at the annual picnic, consequently
when the “Gorsave” enthusiast called upon
the company to join him in the chorus the
reply was grim silence. A burst of astonish-
ment was all the response he got. However,
in consideration of his misplaced moral
pluck the delinquent deserves to have his
salary raised. A man who can sing the
Hanthem as a solo under the impression
that he is putting his boss to shame must
have the courage of his convictions strongly
developed. Such a rate-collector has all the
makings of a useful patriot when the guns
begin to play. Thinking of Australia as the
personal property of his Most Gracious
Majesty King George, he would gladly die
in its defence, singing Rule Britannia as he
foil.

“iEsculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diet} - . We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.
A BORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Avis”: The stone plover seems with us
to have the power of determining the color of its
eggs. It casually drops a couple in a slight depres-
sion of the ground. Yet it is difficult to see them,
because they conform to the color of the earth.
Most ground-building birds select a place like the
color of their eggs; the plover alone can paint the
eggs to look like the ground whereon they are to be
laid. If the ground plover were not a bird it
would be a politician, so apt it is in dropping
remarks that suit its surroundings.
* * * *
“Otto”: The waste of choice timbers in
the N.S.W. North Coast districts in the past has
been heavy. I have seen on the Dorrigo, outhouses,
cowsheds and bails of sound red cedar, and, in one
instance, a three-railed fence of rosewood post and
cedar rails, the latter in a good state of preserva-
tion after 20 years exposure. Even now many
of the houses are built of rosewood throughout. I
have wondered greatly that the hardwoods, which are
not valuable enough to stand the cost of transit to
the coast, are not cut for local requirements and
the pine and rosewood sent to market. Many of the
selections are cut clean; not even a shade-tree left.
Some day the cow cocky will tumble to the good
money he is sending up in smoke, whereupon he will
curse Socialism worse than ever for not looking
after things better.
AT TEE THE ACCIDENT.
THE AVIATOR: “ Looks as if I've just dropped
in in time for dinner!"
“Quidam”: Talk about luck! I was
working with a mate in an old mine on the N.S.W.
South Coast, rising from a drive towards some old
stopes. Our calculation showed that we had 4ft. at
least between us and the stopes, and when the drill
broke through at 2ft., we were so surprised that we
climbed up to investigate. Inspection showed that
the steel had butted up against an unexploded drill-
hole left by the former miners 10 years or so before,
and had pushed the charge, detonator and all, up the
orifice it had orig'inally been put down into. The
explosive and cap, moreover, were in good order, as
we proved later. The surprise we got was nothing
to the one we mightn’t have had time to get if
we had struck the other end of the charge.
“Pegasus”: Re the Papuan way of killing
hogs, as described by “X.P.D.” (B. 29/1/T4). The
Madras coolie, introduced into Fiji under the inden-
ture system, also believes in slaughtering the hog
without losing the animal’s blood. The method
adopted by the coolie is to pinch the windpipe
between the forefinger and thumb until the pig is
dead. Solomon Island “boys” also preserve the
blood in the body. These people bind a cord round
the snout very tightly, commencing at about an inch
above the nose, and finishing just short of the eyes.
Consequently the hog dies —not joyfully nor in hope
of a blessed resurrection, but he dies.
* * * *
“Hobbity Lee”: A good deal of outcry is
made about child-labor, but one doesn’t hear much
about the other extreme, old-age slavery. Heard of
a case the other day where a man who has a poultry
farm had employed an ancient pensioner and his
wife (also a pensioner) to assist him. The old man
was fonder of his liquor than any man should be, so
the farmer (who, by the way, is an ex-minister)
paid him for the service of himself and his wife
one bottle of beer per day! On one occasion the
old chap was sent to purchase some supplies. The
change was sixpence short, so next day he was de-
prived of his beer. And yet, when some little time
after, the pensioner left to take up another position
where he was to be paid 10s. per week, the farmer
murmured something in his whiskers and his Bible
about the ingratitude of some people.
* * » *
“Snell”: Leggo’s cockatoo was the most
ungainly biped I have ever seen. He was bald with
age and wicked living, and he walked on his knuckles.
His ingrowing beak gave him the aspect of a shriv-
elled Ahasuerus, whose “port and mien bore mark of
many years, and chronicles of untold ancientness were
visible within his blameless eye.” On his perch he
suggested a little demon Yid, an ole-clo’ dealer left
over from the day of Moses—one who in his lust for
business had sold even his own old clothes. When
Leggo was not talking to the cockatoo he was talk-
ing about him. Said he to me: “Yorter ’eard him
talk when he was younger. He’s addressed meetin’s,
he has—in the Labor interest. Many’s the good word
he’s put in fer Tim Lee at ’lectioneerin’ times: Give
you my word, he can talk a bit still. On’y the other
mornin’ he was prowlin’ round there ’mong the
chickens, givin’ ’em good advice, when a hawk
shot out of nowhere, ’n’ grabbed him. You’d ’ave
thought it was a meetin’ iv the Wimmen’s Lib’ral
League. Chatter! I c’u’d 'ear him at it when he
was a mile high. Course I thought he was a gonner,
’n’ was considerable broke up about it; but ’long
towards five o’clock who should come ’obblin’ down
the track but him! He’s an awful sight, clawed ’n’
pecked ’n’ dusty. But he pulls himself up on his
perch, ’n’ looks et me outer his good eye. ‘Well,’
sez he, ‘I torked the out of it!’ Then he went
to sleep.”
* * * •
“Ginger”: For an all-out “go” give me a
rough-up between two camels. Witnessed one between
a burly bull and a lighter-built variety of the four-
legged swagman at the back o’ Bourke, and came
away convinced that a man who wanted any more
excitement than a camel fight afforded was a glutton.
The little camel gripped the big fellow’s shinbone
in the first round and went for a fall, but the heavy-
weight dropped on his knees, and in the course of
kneeling chewed about six pounds of biltong from
his adversary’s shoulder. Then he
gripped him by the wither and
smote the ground with his hump.
His next move was to rise and
prepare to put the boot in. The
little fellow, however, proved too
nimble, and was on his feet again
before the pushite got going. In
the second round the lightweight
gripped the big chap by the heel
and scored second fall. It’s a
camel fight for raising the dust.
With feet and mouth the big
fellow fought with the furiosity
of 47 mad dervishes and an entire
consignment of insane mullahs, in-
flicting sundry nasty bites and
receiving some thumping body
blows that might be heard across
at Broken Hill. In the third and
final round the big fellow secured
the fall, and threw himself with
tremendous force on the fallen
bull, crushing him to death. When
Abdul saw the little camel down
and out, and had a look at the
plight the heavyweight was in,
he went home for his Winchester.
Result, two dead camels in the
camp.
“Leo Lear”: I hereby nominate duff as
the most prominent, prolific and popular pudding in
the camps and sheds that lie between the suburban
boundary and the Edge of Things. A cook is no cook
unless he or she can turn out a duff in one of its many
shapes and forms, and I’ve seen men leave a camp
because there was no duff on Sundays. Duff hot, cold
or lukewarm, is all the same to the leather-lining of
the old hand, but duff he must have, be the tempera-
ature at zero or 120 deg. Consider the many species of
the dainty. Plum duff, currant duff, plain duff, jam
duff, treacle duff, black, red and spotted duff,
fried, round, flat and rolled duff, etc.,. Aus-
tralia is said to be a hunting-ground for patent
digestive drugs, and what else can you expect when
you consider the population’s propensity for plain
and fancy and frilled and miscellaneous and dashed
duff?

“Silas Snell”: Spong takes his oath on it.
He went to stay at a favorite Melbourne week-ending
and holiday-resort in the Christmas season, and put
up at a rambling establishment devoted to similar
waifs and strays seeking rest and recreation, change
of scene, and variety of events. Spong’s trouble was
a touch of nerves, and he would have been happy
but for the canoodling of a couple under his window,
where there was a pepper tree. Spong was unable
to change his room, the house being over-loaded with
guests, and he was deterred from taking other action
for fear of involving the parties in a mess. of liti-
gation, the proceedings being illicit. The delinquents
were John Pope and Mrs. McCann, and Mrs. Pope
and Mr. McCann were on the premises. The couple
would gather under the pepper tree, and dribble soft,
silly talk, and make loud, affectionate noises till long
after midnight, while Spong writhed on his bed,
and wished death would come to them in a terrible
shape. Spong passed the point at which forbearance
ceases to be a virtue; then in sheer desperation he
carried his trouble to McCann, and broke the news
to that good man. His complaint was loud and em-
phatic. McCann was sympathetic but nervous. “Yes,
yes,” he said anxiously, “my wife is rather—er—-
injudicious. 7 wish you’d speak to her about it 1”

“Eddyson”: Holland’s new neighbor was
a silent, brooding type, a small, lean, wire-haired
terrier of a man who made no friendships and worked
like a spirit in torment, tearing the trees from
his 200-acre bit, with no apparent object but to
keep him from thinking of his grievances. Sonson
had been on the land six months, and had not ex-
changed two dozen words with Holland during the
whole time; but one afternoon, while Holland was
doctoring a bit of their dividing fence, Sonson drifted
up, and sat on a stump, watching, apathetically.
“Nice day,” said Holland. “Oh, I dunno,” said
Sonson. Silence. “Goin’ t’ stick a few fruit trees
in that bit o’ clearin’ ?” asked Holland. “Oh, I
donno,” said Sonson. More silence. “Speet you’ll
be runnin’ a bit iv a fence along yer front,” said
Holland. Sonson said, “Oh, I dunno.” A very list-
less man was Sonson. He sat through the subse-
quent burst of silence, and let the flies swarm on
him. “Will yeh be sinkin’ a well?” asked Holland.
Sonson said he didn’t know, and after a minute he
added: “It’s my opinion nothin’s worth while.”- Hol-
land thought it over. “S’pose yer right in the
main,” he said. “Iv course I am. We'll all be dead
afore long. Wish I was dead now.” “Go on!” “I
do. I’m sick iv this. Fact, I’m sick iv everythink.”
He thought a moment, and then added dully: “I’m
sick iv you.” “Go on!” said Holland; “that’s bad.”
More silence. “I’m goin’ t’ hang meself,’ said Son-
son. “Are yeh?” said Holland. Sustained silence.
“What ’ud you do if you was me,” said Sonson,
“hang or drownd?” “Think I’d drownd. But maybe
I’d hang. Hangin’s dryer.” He thought a moment,
and then added: “And warmer.” Silence. Sonson:
“Hangin’s awkwarder than drowndin’.” Holland ad-
mitted that. “But,” he said brightly, “you’re easier
found.” Sonson nodded. “Better hang, I think,” he
said. He thought for 10 minutes. “You’re right,”
he said; “hangin’s my favorite.” Both were silent
for a quarter of an hour, during which time Sonson
sat in profound gloom. Then he said: “But it is
awkward.” More silence extending over half an hour.
Holland had finished his job and gathered up his
tools. He went to Sonson, stood by him, and put a
kindly hand on his shoulder. “Don’t you go ’n’
worry,-” -he said sympathetically. “Come up to the
house to-night, and I’ll teach you some knots.”
“Swan”: Re “Pick’s” (B. 19/2/T4) query
as to how insects and small bush creatures learn of
the coming of a still distant bush fire, I fancy the
explanation is to be found in what I dub the con-
tagion of fear. Birds and fleet-footed creatures
ahead of the demonstration carry the alarm abroad
to their furred and feathered neighbors. These, in
turn, alarm other creatures whose cries of fear and
panicky movements scare even the smallest insects.
So the wild dog and the gohanna and the spider and
the ant and the bunyip and the crow and the germ
all get moving, and the crocodile runs in front and
the debbil-debbil runs behind.

SUMMER RAIN,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For three, warm, choking nights, the mist the peer-
ing moonlight bars,
And bandages the river’s face
As thought she were in some disgrace
For smiling at the stars.
The balconies are dull with damp, the grass is
beaded over,
A dew drip from the dark-trunked trees
Washes the gold trail of the bees
And sags the jaunty clover.
And then there dawns a morn of cloud, of smoke
that will not rise,
But hangs, a grey sash to the day,
And dips its fringes in the bay,
Rejected by the skies.
One raven caws in paddocks brown, the black ants
are house-moving;
The cineraria spreads its cup,
The distant range stands blackly up
With sharp, defiant grooving.
A ripple o’er all green things runs, through cloud
the bright drops strain,
And pit the mealy waves of dust
To write along the dry earth’s crust
The preface of the rain !

BEALE PIANOS.
The facff that to-day we are the largest piano firm doing business in the Commonwealth is due solely to the
quality of our instruments.
No effort has been spared in the manufacture of Beale Pianos to reach perfection of tone and ensure
durability. To-day our instruments stand absolutely unrivalled in those respects.
Beale Pianos are specially designed and made to meet all the exigencies of the Australian climate. They
embody every improvement known in piano construction, and are made under the direct supervision of an expeit who
has made scientific piano manufacture a life study. In addition, they possess special features which you cannot get in
other pianos ; such as our permanent steel tuning-system, hexagonal bass-strings, patent east-in liitch-pins, and our
patent method of building up the casework.
The Beale Permanent Steel Tuning System renders what was hitherto the weakest part of a piano the strongest.
In every Beale Piano the wrest-plank is made of solid iron. The wrest-plank is that part of the piano into which aie
driven the tuning pins to which are attached the wires (or “strings ). In every imported piano the wrest-plank is
made of wood, which has to bear the strain (about 20 tons) of all the wires when the piano is in tune. So that in eveiy
piano that has a wooden wrest-plank there is a probability of the wrest-plank splitting and the piano becoming untunable
in consequence. And in every piano but the Beale the wrest-plank is made of wood.
In all Beale Pianos the wrest-plank is solid iron, a part of the iron frame itself.
Write for our special booklets explaiuing this matter in detail.
We have recently put on the market the Beale Player-Piano. The Beale Player-Piano possesses the finest
mechanism it is possible to produce, fitted in a Beale high-grade piano of handsome appearance. Ihe artistic possi-
bilities of the interpretation of a roll on the Beale Player-Piano are limited only by the artistic temperament of the
performer. The mechanism is so delicately regulated and every control so perfect that it is easier to play than any othei
piano-player.
FREE LIFE INSURANCE : We supply, when requested, a Free Life Insurance Policy, without any charge
whatever, to buyers of Beale Pianos. This covers the life of the customer during the course of hire-purchase, and
insures a valuable and saleable asset to the family without further payment in case of bereavement. The Policy is a
purely free gift from Beale and Co., Etd., so that no other person may claim under it than the peison named by the
customer when accepted by us.
All Beale Pianos carry our written guarantee for Twenty-five Years.
A Beale Piano is lower in price, quality for quality, than any other piano you can buy, and in after cost it is
also cheaper, because it requires far less tuning and less frequent expert attention in every way.
PARTS : Should you by accident damage your Beale Piano we can always replace any injured or. broken
parts at a very low cost to you, because we are the actual makers, with our factory facilities here in Australia. But if
you buy an imported piano, and it gets damaged, you will find it expensive to repair, because the agents have no factory
facilities here and they do not carry stocks of spare parts.

A HOME-MADE HAIR GROWER, 1
THAT DOES MARVELS.
During the last few years announcements
have appeared occasionally telling how to
make a really good hair tonic that would
actually make the hair grow, and it gives us
gieat pleasure to learn that so many who
have tried it have obtained such remarkable
results. One lady writes that immediately
after reading the formula, she went to her
chemist and had him put up, as directed.
ir 011^. 06 ! La vona de Composee, i dram
Menthol Crystals, and 3 ounces Bay Rum
She took this home and, although her hair
had been falling out terribly, and she was
threatened with baldness, she was astonished
and dehghted to note that the falling out
ot the hair stopped immediately, and the
hail itself began to grow in an amazing
manner. In fact, she states that it has
already grown nearly 8 inches in a little over
two months. Moreover, her hair is now
brighter, glossier and more luxuriant than
ever, and is still growing. She rubbed the
tonic into the roots twice a day for the first
three weeks, but now applies it only once a
day. It is especially interesting to note
from this and other reports that this home-
made hair grower not only makes the hair
grow most marvellously, but it also destroys
the dandruff germ and keeps the hair roots
and scalp in a perfectly healthy and normal
condition.*
Edison s:.ys on account of the increasing cost of
wood all furniture is destined to be of steel. “Since
the steel for a given piece of furniture costs only
one-fifth as much as the wood. Steel furniture is
light, because only a little steel is required and it can
be polished in perfect imitation of mahogany, walnut,
or oak. Babies in the next generation will sit on
steel high chairs and eat from steel tables.”

“Ginger”: The bloke who waltzes Matilda
falls in with a varied assortment of track mates. I
have bivouacked with a diplomaed doctor, five chem-
ists, two medical students, an engineer, half a dozen
telegraph operators (there are two in the strike camp
where this is written), two of Australia’s foremost
poets, several ex-M’s.L.A., a disrated Salv’army per-
sonage and even a decayed importer. Absolutely the
whitest and most companionable mate I ever struck
was “Soldier” Woods, who once bumped Speaker
Abbott out of Henry Willis’s one-time seat (Upper
Hunter). And it wasn’t drink or two-up or wild cat
or fast women or slow horses that sent him on the
track. He went out of his old business on a point
of political conviction.
* * * *
“Clean Kid”: To make a shower bath outs
back, do this: Take a kerosene bucket with handle
on, and make a nice, neat, round, half-inch hole in
centre of bottom. Dig up a long, quarter-inch bolt
with nut attached, remove nut, put on a wide leather
or rubber washer next the head. Drop this (head and
washer inside) in the hole and screw on the nut
underneath, so j r ou can lift or drop your tap at
will. Weight it up underneath till it lifts and drops
nicely, and then fasten on a long string (inside the
tin) to manipulate. Cut the end off another tin,
leaving on about four inches of the sides, and per-
forate the bottom. Fasten it on below tap, fill your,
bucket with milk, water or beer, throw the plough
reins over one of the rafters, fix or tie to handle of
bucket, haul said bucket aloft, and, having removed
your clobber and put umbrella up, pull the tap
string, and let her go.

“Tiaki”: Hori Ereora was glim-digging in
the Bay of Islands (M.L.) when, happening to hear
an unusual sound at the upper side of the flax-bush
on the hillside where he was working, he looked up
and saw the Devil surveying him and his work.
Hori resorted to speed as a means of escape. Dan
and I happened to be in the Waikare pa when the
fugitive arrived. He told us between gasps: “I see
te taepo t’is time or-right. O Krise, he te pakeha
Tewil, sure’nuif. He te pi-i-ig ferra, ’pout ’is ’igh’s
t’at posh” (indicating a carved tekoteko on the
gable of the meeting-house). “I peen tiggin’ te
kum, an’, by Herra, he rook at me. By Cripe, I
te werry frighten’ ; I erear out, an’ py-an’-pye’ I
rook round an’ I see te Tewil tchump awfter me—
pi-i-g tchump ’ (indicating with his hand trajec-
tories of about 200yds.). “Oh Herra, he ca’ch me I
tink, an ten I ko rike prazes.” “You must have
been dreaming, Horo,” suggested Dan. “No fear!
I see te fire come out his eye an’ te smoke come
out his mout’. Te petter way, you come in te whare
an’ we rock te toor. S’pose we ket te gun
might we s’oot ’im.” We declined, in spite of
Hori s pleadings. Dan said he didn’t give a cuss
for the Devil. In a very short time every human
being, tame pig and dog were safe within doors,
and the pa had the appearance of Goldsmith’s
Deserted Village. Then, sure enough, came the
“Tewil.” He was scarcely as tall as Hori had
made him out; also, there was an utter absence
of fire and smoke about him. Likewise his jumps
were the usual hops of an ordinary kangaroo. Mr.
William’s escaped pet was, in short, as much like
Satan as a Wesleyan pulpit. All he wanted was
company, and he seemed quite sad because Hori
had declined to give it to him.
THE DIGNITY OF THE MODERN
DANCE.
MISS FAIRSPRITE: “ Don't, you think the
Tango delightful? I wonder why people
condemn it? ”
MR. PLAINSIGHT: “ Probably on account of
the fwightfully queer-looking people that
dance it, donckerknow. "
Pick”: Some weeks ago a family, includ-
ing the cat, left Bungendore (N.S.W.) by train, for
Summer Hill, 179 miles away. A fortnight later
the cat, very footsore and weary, limped into the
forsaken abode at Bungendore, and wanted to know
who had been shifting the furniture. The condition
of his feet explained that he returned per boot; but
earthquakes wouldn’t shift out of him the secret of
how he knew the road.
THE UNBIASSED JUDGE.
If I wish to speak about a fight I go to a fight and see for myself,” said Mr White to-day when
discussing his visit to the Opera House. “I like to know both sides of a case before I condemn I
visited many picture shows in Melbourne expressly for the purpose of seeing what the Tango was like,
and I came to the conclusion from what I saw that it was timmoral and a dinger."-Nows item.
FIRST WOWSER: “Disgraceful! Disgraceful! Let us go away! ”
SECOND DITTO: “ On the contrary, let us study it again and yet again. Only by constant
observation of its movements can we come to a -ust judgment of its iniquity .”
Nestor : Apropos recent par. concerning
James Squire and the first hop vine, the following
appeared in the Illustrated London News, August
3 ’ 1850: “ A vessel which has arrived in the Thames
Dock from Sydne y, New South Wales, has brought a
P arcel of h °P s > consigned as part of her cargo. This
is the flrst instanee of an importation of this article

ance’” * * *
<<T T „ . „ .' ,
■ L,e ° lj ‘ ear : Atter camping and tramping
along a few Australian rivers I conclude our water-
ways on the whole behave in a more sober,
decorous and stately way than the story-
writer alleges. When floods come along the
channels of romance, they rush in a face
miles wide and oceans deep, sweeping to per-
dition everything not anchored to the forma-
tions of permanency. Now, I’ve seen floods
rise in many streams, and it is the exception
for one to come down in a face. Some of
the small creeks certainly do, and they fall
again as quickly, but in the larger ones the
tide arrives sedately and soon eases off. It
goes to fill half-empty holes, and loses itself
in the wide reaches. Certainly, in the back
plains country, the rivers sometimes spread
out quickly enough to catch stock in low
land. But the wall-of-water yarn with a
dead coach in front and 3£ miles of railway
iron trailing behind, is a rare exception.
Still, along the coastal ranges, especially in
the North, it wouldn’t pay a traveller to bunk
in a dry creek bed when a storm is passing
along the mountains. The small creek with
the hills behind it is the little pot that is
soon hot. I’ve seen creeks of the bubbly sort
rise 30ft. in a couple of hours, much of the
water coming down en bloc from the catch-
ment areas of the upper hills. Was once
camped on a watercourse of this description
when eight inches of rain tumbled down in
six hours. From a quiet brook the gulch was
transferred into a raging devil in one act,
banks being ripped and trees uprooted. The
hardy ti-tree, that hangs on to rock crevices
in the bed, was the only thing that looked 1
none the worse at the finish. T reckon this
red-flowering, bottle-brushed vegetable is about the
toughest thing we have in this continent; and, con-
sidering the Peace Society and the C.S.R. Co., that
is. some, tough.
* *. * *
“McNorth”: I don’t know much about
White Slaving, but I’ve seen some of the black
variety as practised by Binghi. The old buck,
especially if he is a mamoose, or invested with the
duties of a policeman, is the worst offender. The
policy is to get hold of, or “marry,” as many
young gins as possible, prostitute them to lustful
strangers, and seize the profits. Many of these para-
sites do a roaring trade. In between times, when
immoral visitors are scarce, the ladies go out andi
dig yams or locate the wild bee, and so keep the'
pot simmering. Disease is prevalent, but that
doesn’t worry Binghi. The nigs in the police em-
ploy are frequent “carriers.” They are constantly
travelling, and many of them soon contract “a cer-
tain disease,” which they cheerfully pass on. By
virtue of their office and the red stripe on their
trousers, they are able to force their attentions on
gins who would otherwise have nothing to do with
them. In one tribe I saw five young gans, all
under 12 years of age, with sores on their legs
and under their eyes. Two could hardly walk In
answer to my query as to how they came to be
in such a state, they answered that the police boys
were the cause. I’m only a layman, and my ignor-
ance of medicine is enormous; but I’m game to
wager two drinks that those gins were suffering
from syphilis.
The TJ.S.A. National Conference on Race
Betterment talked straight the other day
Dr. Laugh]in urged sterilisation in order to pre-
vent the propagation of bad types of society. By
the sale of tobacco and liquors, he said, they encour-
aged mental deterioration, which resulted in crime.
Dr. Stephen Smith, president of the conference,
who is 92 years of age, urged that the normal limit
of human life was 100 years.
Presumably. Smith’s prescription for retain-
ing life (with maybe no interest in life be-
yond the sterilisation of the young who
smoke cigarettes) would be red flannel, a diet
of monkey nuts, and the chewing of every
mouthful 643 times, and the only beverage
four quarts daily of distilled water, with not
more than a two-millionth part of a gramme
of phosphate to the gallon. If the ancient
has lived the other way his doctrine would
be. mostly advice to vote early at all brew-
eries within the electorate. There used to
be a little, thin doctor in Melbourne who did
a lot of examination of assurance proponents.
He himself was an atom —a genius of famine.
He weighed about seven stone, which he in-
sisted was the actuarial weight for his
height according to the tables. When he
strinned a proponent and found him with
sufhcieut meat on his bones to indicate one
meal a day he would sav: “Yee’re too fat;
111 hae to lod ye.” His ideal proponent was
a man so emaciated that he looked as if he
had been rescued from crows after two days’
exposure. And of such is the kingdom of
cranks.
“The Pariah”: It’s the same old filth:
but. the Yankee Peace professor is here
again, whipping up the No-defence-whatever-
happens party, so let’s push it where they
must smell it again. Famine has been stalk-
ing in portion of Japan, and the “civilised”
Jap. seeks the way out that seems most
natural to him. “Thousands of girls are
arriving at Tokio from the famine district
and are being sold by their parents into
slavery.” Not domestic slavery! the girls
go into one or other of the big Government
brothels, and every tourist, unless lie makes
a request to the contrary, is taken to view
the quarter. Behind a grille are placed two
to 20 of the unfortunates, and the intending
customer walks leisurely along the street
making his choice. Few of the girls are
over 21, and some are certainly not 12.
The older ones often banter the onlooker, and
by voice and gesture invite his patronage.
Many of the younger ones shrink as far
from the street as possible. Near by are the
schools, where the brown kiddies are taught
that Australia is their natural heritage.
One of these days, when the big trouble
comes, a prominent Peace Society man will
flee to some tropic isle of quiet, and after a
year or two will return to Sydney or Mel-
bourne as a tourist. How pleased he will
be to see his favorite daughter shrinking or
brazen behind a grille, while a crowd of un-
moral Japs take stock of her and her com-
panions !

They left the flock to face the frown,
The grip of foemen strange,
They fled the fleshpots of the town

Old Bischoff saw their camp-fires pass,
Mount Lyell saw them glow,

From Emu Bay to Williamsford,
From Strahan unto Dundas,

Beneath, the drifted snow,
The men that tramped the button-grass—
Thirty years ago !
Where red their outpost camp-fires roared
To forest legions thinned,
The axe flung, like a levin sword,
Its challenge down the wind ;

The myrtle host lie low,
The men that tramped the button-grass—
Thirty years ago!—
From out their dreams the cities rose
As still from hill heads grey
The fii st red flush of morning grows
Into the lord of day.

Smith’s Reformation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LETTER of introduction to the Rev.
Cecil Baynes, M.A., procured me an
excellent tea and an hour’s unworldly
advice.
The old gentleman was sparring my hints
of a small loan, when the little, bedraggled
general rushed into the dining-room waving
a grubby hand : “Quick, sir, summun’s get-
ting yer pony.” With a clerical expletive
and a “Be careful, dear” from his wife, the
parson shuffled to the back door, and I fol-
lowed at his slippered heels. By a full
moon’s light we saw a well-dressed, portly
man hammering at the stable-door and loudly
demanding admission.
Whispering to me: “That’s Mr. Craven,
the wealthy draper,” the parson stepped
softly across the yard and put his hand on
the stout man’s shoulder. “My dear Mr.
Craven, this is not your home. Would you
like to lie down for a while?” Craven glared
at him and then at me. “Why the blazes
don’t you go for the police?” he shouted.
The parson held up a reproachful hand.
“Pray, let me understand.”
Craven explained in angry, disjointed sen-
tences how a brown bag, containing the
day’s takings of his shop, had been snatched
from his hand; how he had chased the thief
along various streets and how the “little
rat” had sought refuge in the parsonage
stable.
The parson pawed Craven’s arm impres-
sively. “My dear brother, I have had a life-
long experience with criminals. Allow me
to deal with him.”
Taking Craven’s grunt as an assent, he
knocked at the door. “My poor friend, I
am a minister. Let me come in.”
Surprised, we saw the door partly open
and the parson glide in sideways, with a
triumphant smile.
Craven was stamping with impatience
when the parson reappeared with the bag
in his hand, waving a little, careworn man
forward. “This poor man’s name is Smith.
He has been sorely tried, but on our knees
we have prayed for his redemption, and he is
genuinely repentant. Now go, Smith, and
may the Lord bless you.”
Deftly avoiding Craven’s uplifted foot,
Smith blessed us all, and scattered to the
street.
The parson handed the bag to Craven
with a persuasive smile. . “My dear brother,
now that l have regained your property,
don’t you think you could spare a mite for
the Church?”
Craven opened his bag reluctantly and
drew out some wet wash-leather alnd 'a
curry-comb.

The Bishop of Bath and Wells writes: “ The
value of Formamint as a preventive is
appreciated in this house.”
The Archdeacon of Bristol writes: “I habitually
carry Wulfing’s Formamint with me as a
preventive of Sore Throat.”
The Earl of Kilmorey writes : “lam glad to give
my testimony to the soothing and curative
effects of your potent remedy—Formamint,
with which lam so familiar. As is my
constant practice, I keep one of your brown
bottles on my dressing table.”
How to Avoid infectious Diseases.
Do you realise that most of the dangerous infectious
diseases, such as Diphtheria, Consumption, Influenza, Scarlet
hever, Measles and the like, are caused by germs which gain
entrance to the body through the mouth and throat ?
The minute living organisms which produce such diseases
grow and develop like the seeds of plants, and the mouth and
throat form an ideal hot-house for cultivating them.
The scientist, of course, can grow them outside the body,
artificially. For example, a test-tube culture of the germs
which cause Consumption is depicted here ; and also a bottle
of Wulfing’s Formamint—the means which Science has. found
to destroy such germs in the mouth and throat, and so protect
us against the diseases which they breed.

THE GERM-KILLING THROAT TABLET
These harmless and palatable tablets contain the most
powerful destroyer of disease germs known to Science. They
dissolve in the saliva, and the disinfectant is thus carried to
every little crevice, chink, or cranny in the mouth, gums,
tonsils and throat. Thus all germ growths are sought out and
destroyed, their spread is checked, their power to do harm is
entirely broken.
As a preventive of infectious disease, Formamint Tablets
should be used daily by everyone, in health or sickness, and
they are particularly recommended for school children, who
are so exposed to infection, especially at this time of the year.
Beware, however, of harmful imitations ; there is only one
genuine Formamint, viz. Wulfing’s, and all Chemists sell it at
2S. 6d. per bottle. The manufacturers, A. Wulfing & Co.,
i7> Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W., will gladly send you a Free
Sample and an interesting Booklet, if you write to them,
mentioning this paper, and enclose two penny stamps towards
postage.
The Shipping Combine and the Curse
that Binds Us to It.
Dr. John McCall, the Apple Speck’s
Agent-General in London, has been poking
an inquiring nose into the methods of the
shipping ring, alias Shipping Conference,
whose headquarters are in the land of Bull,
and whose hindquarters sit heavily on the
loyal “outposts of Empire.” During last
session of the Tasmanian Parliament,
Woods, M.H.A., urged Premier Solomon to
tell the House why sea freights from London
to Hobart were some ss. per ton higher
than from London to Maoriland, 1200 miles
further off; and why freights by the direct
route were not considerably lower than
when the goods were sent via Melbourne
and transhipped across Bass Strait.
Premier Solomon passed the query on to
the Agent-General, and has just received a
reply, from which the following is an ex-
tract :
The more one studies this shipping business the
more intricate one finds it, and it would appear that
the Shipping Conference controlling it is supreme.
No company trading to Australia would interfere with
traders to Hobart, and even charterers would have to
be quite certain that they were not going to meet
with the opposition of the Conference, otherwise it
would be an extremely risky business for them to
enter into a charter. I do not deny that you could
charter a ship, but, if you did so, and the Conference
were opposed to you, you could obtain practically no'
freight, as regular shippers would probably receive a
hint informing them that, if they used the chartered
steamer their rebate would be cancelled, and past
experience would tell them that they might be ham-
pered in other ways. In one case where a ship was
loaded ready to leave for Australia, the shippers had
all the goods unloaded rather than face the penalties
which they believed would be imposed. Indeed, if
one owned a steamer, it would not pay him to carry
his own goods in it free, if he were a regular shipper,
t.e.» What he would gain in one trip would be more
than lost in his future trading. What would have to
be done in such a case would be to allow someone
in the Conference to charter the steamer and then
pay the regular freight on one’s own goods as if he
had no interest as owner of the ship. This freight
might be nearly double ; certainly it would be 25 to
30 per cent, more than he would be receiving for
the Hire of his steamer. The fact is that the Confer-
ence are masters of the position.
After expressing the opinion that the
Government steamers would get no regular
freight unless shippers were indemnified
against a possible Conference boycott, or
unless the Government was prepared to
compete against the combine with a fleet
big enough to carry the whole trade,
Dr. McCall concludes: —
A private company starting in opposition to any line
whose owners are in the Conference would have to be
a very strong one indeed. The only hope I can see
for a reduction in Hobart freights is in any future
general reduction that may be made by the Conference,
or in the cost of transport from Melbourne to Tas-
mania.
Preference to unionists, when the unionists
are working men, is declared to be a vile
thing, and an encroachment on the liberty
of the subject, and generally to deserve
being suppressed; and in response to the
outcry of the Fatman and the Right-think-
ing Person the Jocook Government has
suppressed it in the public service. Yet
there is no labor preference to unionists in
the world equal in stringency to this pre-
ference which the Fat ship-owning unionists
so implacably insist upon. The situation
would be identical if labor-unionists, fairly
well paid at 12s. per day, insisted upon
being paid 205., the extra Ss. being refunded
if the employers abstained from employing
any but unionists and absolutely forfeited
if they hired a non-unionist for any job
whatever. The shipowners’ union in Britain
is so monstrously strong that Agent-General
McCall is probably right in saying that
even if the Commonwealth put on steamers
to carry the Australian trade it would get
no general trade unless it could assure the
traders of its ability to carry all their goods
and go on carrying them indefinitely. The
situation is a pretty hopeless one. And
Australia has itself to thank for being in
the power of the merciless combine. To a
self-contained country the machinations of
a shipping ring don’t mean anything. But
Australia has borrowed so many millions
that it must send steady ship-loads of goods
to pay the interest bill; and it goes on
borrowing and must pay whatever the com-
bine likes to ask for bringing the goods that
represent the loans. For, of course, Aus-
tralia never gets its loans in gold: they
come in goods, and mostly manufactured
goods at that.
♦
Australia is so saturated with the idea
that all a country’s trade should flow
through one capital city, that it naturally
reckons, when it ships butter to London, that
it has done everything in reason to supply all
England with the cow-fat. But England
declines to regard London as its one ship-
ping port; wherefore, when the Agents-
General were lately called upon to tell their
Governments what was wrong with the mar-
keting of Australian butter on the other side,
the Grocers’ Review said that common-
sense ought to supply the answer. “Austra-
lian produce should be shipped to the port
nearest the district wherein it is to be con-
sumed, so that the trade may buy it at the
minimum cost. Why should a grocer in the
Potteries district be compelled to buy Aus-
tralian butter in London?” Still the Gro-
cers’ Review isn’t at all certain that the
Agents-General will tell their Governments
this plain truth, since it alleges that, instead
of the Commission asking . provincial
traders what they thought of the matter, the
witnesses were mostly Government officials
and Tooley-street salesmen; and naturally
Tooley-street salesmen would find 97 reasons
why all the trade should go through London
-—just as the York-street merchant can find
97 reasons why the trade of all N. S. Wales
should pass through Sydney Heads.
The Watt Government is toying with a
scheme for the construction of a boulevard
along the Yarra, from Hawthorn up to
Heidelberg, also a bridge. Private
Enterprise, in the shape of the usual shind.v-
kit, is rushing Kew Council, as the body
chiefly concerned, with a philanthropic offer
to lay down and work an up-to-date electric
tramway through the area in return for
the franchise of the roads occupied for 25
years, the shindykit having got an option
of purchase over 1500 acres in the neigh-
borhood of the proposed bridge, and hav-
ing a mind to lay out a “garden city”
thereon. That is the way the large-souled
syndicate puts it. _ Another .way is. this : The.
State builds a bridge over the Yarra at one
of the prettiest spots around the metropolis
and constructs a drive from there to the
city. A tramway running through Kew and
the newly-opened district, returning via
Fairfield and Northcote, would be a pay-
able proposition from the start, and would
yield the municipalities handsome dividends
in less than a decade. So Private Enter-
prise lays its paw on nearly 2\ square miles
of the best-situated residential sites —which
will, of course, be sold at a profitable figure
—and then offers to run the tram-
way for its own profit, provided it
is granted a monopoly for a quarter
century. Also, as its 1500 acres in-
clude the land right down to the water’s
edge, it magnanimously offers to hand over
enough for the boulevard free. The boule-
vard is urgently necessary to improve the
syndicate’s property, so it really proposes to
allow the public to do some essential work
for it provided the said old public hands
it over a valuable monopoly. In short, it
proposes to charge the community 2d. for
allowing the community to give it 3d. Con-
sequently it will go away with a beaming
countenance and sd.
“A.P.F.,” his idea or notion: —
Years of hard work, and the employment of expen-
sive instructors and tons of apparatus that soon gets
out of date —all these are needed to produce even
passably efficient electricians, wireless operators,
aeroplane mechanics, mechanical engineers, signallers,
etc., for the nation’s use in war-time. Why can’t
part, at least, of this essential work be done in an-
other way? Already a rough attempt has been made
to produce soldier-engineers where civilian engineers
are thickest —in Queensland, for instance, engineer
detachments are located at the big ironworks of Ips-
wich and Maryborough. But the recruiting, at best,
is only amongst the ’prentice lads. The skilled
tradesmen of all sorts, with years of training in work
that is to a great extent identical with the military
duties performed by the “scientific corps,” have no
compulsion to serve, in fact, they’re ruled out by
age. A few days training a year would enable such
men to adapt their shop-acquired skill to military
requirements. The Morse code is the same, whether
the operator uses a telegraphists’ key or a helio-
graph. Gas-engines are run much the same for
searchlights as for printing-presses. The biggest of
all potential sources of supply for this extremely
precious kind of soldier is the Postal Department,
which employs hundreds of telegraphists, instrument-
fitters, linesmen, mounted letter-carriers (handy men
for mounted signalling units), etc. I reckon it is
up to some old Government to make employment
in the technical branches of the Postal Department
and Federal railways, in the pilot service, on
steamers subsidised to carry mails, etc., conditional
upon the applicants enlisting in whatever branch of
the military or naval service their daily training
will come handiest for. You may make any ordinary
young fellow into a passable infantryman inside a
year or two, at a pinch, but £lOOO a man can’t
buy, at short notice, the soldier-mechanics and sea-
men-gunners that can’t be done without in the
modern war-trade.

“Croson’s” valedictory:—
The time-honored “Goulburn Levees” —the alleged
banks that were supposed to keep the Goulburn
river to a straight course, and prevent its wander-
ing over the Commonwealth at large, and thus allow
of many thousands of rich alluvial flats being
reclaimed and cultivated, and so forth —are no more.
The Vic. State Government has decided to drop the
whole business, and, incidentally, £ 120,000 worth
of permanent and reproductive debt into the middle
of the stream or thereabouts. In the middle ’9o's
thc' Vrc. P.W; Department busted £90,000 on these
banks, but they didn’t avert the floods to any
extent; in fact, they aggravated them, because the
blessed water broke through, and, having done so,
couldn’t get back again as speedily as if there were
no banks. After that, various tinkerings and repairs
were effected, and, later on, the State Rivers and
Water Commission tackled the alleged problem. It
proposed to spend another £75,000, and it blewed
£25,000, and was thinking of levying a flat rate
of Bd. per acre per annum to meet the accumulated
bills when the landowners —of the usual Rodney and
surrounding districts —poured their lamentations into
the receptive ears of authority; and authority, being
full up of the Goulburn, its levees and its landownere,
decided to flee from the whole business and let
Nature take its course—and whatever else it had a
mind to. It is a disastrous, though possibly only tem-
porary. end to a bungled scheme, but it is soothing
to recollect that posterity will, as usual foot the
bill.
“Exempt” writes during bis watch below: —
The Merchant Service Guild of Australasia has
mast-headed what looks like a genuine grievance,
resulting, like so many other grievances in this coun-
try, from the virulent craze for the imported
article. Recently there was a vacancy in Ma’s pilot
service, and, naturally, instead of appointing an Aus-
tralian shipmaster who spends more or less of his life
conning vessels in and out of Port Jackson and other
local ports (what there are of them), the job was
presented to the captain of a deep-sea tramp. It is
true he holds a pilot’s exemption ticket, but being
skipper of a British registered steamer, he is not
allowed by Law to use it, and every time his vessel
arrives at or departs from a N.S.W. port he is com-
pelled to employ a local pilot. The appointment led
the Guild to tell Minister Hoyle that it was blowed
if it could understand why Australian seamen, in
every way competent, should be passed over in favor
of Britishers who while no doubt equally able, lack
the very quality that counts most in a pilot—actual
pilotage experience. Hoyle promised to have in-
quiries made, and if (as is the case) competent Aus-
tralian pilots are available, to give instructions that
they shall be appointed to the service as opportun-
ity arises, instead of utter strangers. It sounds all
so rational that the wonder is that there was ever
cause to make such a promise.

“Homestead” writes wearily:—
N.S.W. Full Court has put up another scrap with
the Crown Lands Acts, and the results are dubious.
In 1910 a selector down Wollongong way was run-
ning his stock on his own land. Part of it being
required for the town water supply, was presently
resumed, and the water supply inaugurated. Recently
some of his stock got loose, and, being unaware of
the change of ownership, pranced on to the catch-
ment area. The Crown thereupon sued the owner
for allowing his stock to prance contrary to the law
made and provided (Crown Lands Act 1884, sec.
133). The defendant admitted to owning the cows,
admitted that they trespassed, but refused to admit
that they were on Crown lands, claiming by expensive
counsel that Crown lands meant land owned by the
Crown from the beginning of things, and not land
purchased by the Government for public purposes.
The Full Court listened to this extraordinary pro-
posal, ran up and down the whole gamut of land
legislation since Margaret Catchpole, and unanimously
decided that the selector was quite right. The Court
quite failed to discover any definition of Crown
lands to cover the earth or dirt in dispute, and dis-
missed the case, with costs against the, as usual,
luckless Crown. The thing to do now, seeing that
nobody appears to be sure what Crown land reallv
consists of, would be to pass a short Act putting
the matter beyond argument; but I don’t suppose
that will be done. It’s too simple and sure. Besides,
there’s a whole avenue of courts still yawning for
Costs.

Healthy, Happy and Contented are the Babies
Fed on Albulactin with Diluted Cow’s Milk.
IT affords me great pleasure to send you a testimonial as to
the excellent and eminently satisfactory results obtained
from the use of your valuable preparation, Albulactin.
“ Our baby was suffering from a very weak digestion, and
unable to digest cow’s milk, however weakly diluted. Our doctor
recommended Albulactin, and brought us the first bottle along to
try. Within 24 hours a change was noted for the better; and
since then, a period of eight months, baby has never looked back,
and to-day, at 10 months’ old, weighs 24 lbs. without his clothes,
has eight teeth, and is almost walking.
“ We have recommended this valuable preparation to another
lady in this town whose baby is suffering froai an ulcerated
stomach, and have also passed on to her your invaluable booklet,
‘ King Baby.’ ” —Mr. CHAS. B. PEARSON, Featherstone Street,
Palmerston, N., New Zealand.
Albulactin
Lady Hardinge (wife of
the British Minister to

POLITICAL
POINTS
The hollowness of the anti-Irish Llome
Rule agitation of the scrap of Ulster which
always talks and foams at the mouth as if
it were the whole province, has been curi-
ously demonstrated. Asquith, the white-
haired British Premier, who is a lath painted
to look like iron, has suggested that the
militant and mouth-foaming section of
Ulster might be allowed to stand out. of
autonomous Ireland, if it expressed, by a
popular vote, a desire to do so. Whereupon
the Carson crowd demanded that the vote
should not be taken by electorates, because
if that was done, Londonderry—historic
’Derry on the Foyle—would probably accept
Home Rule and break away. It is actually
proposed to deprive “Protestant” Derry of
the blessings of liberty for which its an-
cestors fought—and to do this in order to
prevent it being ‘voluntarily “enslaved by
Rome.”
IN TOPHET.
BETTERHALFUS : “ Now then, what's the joke?"
TELEPHONEUS : “ The New South Wales tax-
payers are giving their opinion of Holman's
Budget proposals .”
The Englishman’s tub again. The chief
medical officer of the London County Council
has reported that 30 per cent, of the girls
attending the State schools in his district
are infested with vermin. It blows a lot of
the romance out of the British family novel.
“Public Servant” writes :
Premier Holman has flatly refused to try to pass
the Public Service Superannuation Bill this session
on the ground of lack of time. Last Parliament,
when time was even more precious, the Government
forced through a partially digested scheme which it
professed was sufficient for the needs of Ma’s public
servants. In actual fact, the measure was merely
an election placard, and now that it has served its
purpose, it is no secret that the Government is only
too pleased to remember that the Leg. Council biffed
the Bill out. With a big deficit the Public Service
is going to be very lucky if it gets a Superannuation
scheme through before 1917. This writer prophesies
that the measure will be again used as burley to catch
the Public Service fish in three years time. After
that, anything may happen, but I fear the worst.
By “0.K.” :
In striking contrast to the genteel vaporings of
lady-leagues in fashionable subbubs the Australasian
Women’s Asso. has been discussing the horrors of
syphilis. Representatives of the less horror-stricken
branches of the A.W.A. favored an amendment of the
Marriage Act by a clause making it compulsory on
would-be brides and bridegrooms to produce a medi-
cal certificate re their freedom from contagious disease
ere they got joined together in holy matrimony. A
matron from Footscray pointed out that maidenly
objections to receiving male medical advice as re-
gards the peril could be met by the employment of
women doctors. Other rational delegates spoke to
the same effect, and the conference decided to refer
its resolutions to the A.N.A., with a view to a joint
appeal to the Government re the enforcement of the
Contagious Diseases Act. Seeing that any public dis-
cussion of matters which were formerly dismissed
as “unmentionable,” promises to lead to good results,
it is hardly necessary to remark that the A.W.A.
mixed a little nonsense with its reasonable utter-
ances. Somebody protested that Parliament should
legislate against “those persons whose lives had been
steeped in vice,” as though syphilis radiated from a
centre of the blackest immorality. Unfortunately the
purification of all the courtesans in Christendom
would not stop the spread of venereal disease. As
for the most enthusiastic profligates of the other sex,
the “monsters” who are steeped in vice, it is not from
them that society has most to fear. A strictly en-
forced C.D. Act is as desirable as any other system
of street cleaning, but the main hope of the
humanitarian lies in the social movement towards
education of young men and maidens in a knowledge
of their danger. The dense ignorance of the ordinary
careless girl must be enlightened ; the average care-
less young man must be scared into a sense of the
risk lie runs in pursuing an easy amour to its con-
clusion.
PARTY GOVERNMENT.
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the
roost. (It also makes the cradle mighty un-
comfortable. )
One of the futilities of the hour was the
recent proposition of Dooley, M.L.A., that
N.S.W. badly wants a rent strike. Strikes
are a form of tumult or industrial civil war
whereby men endeavor to get justice when
the law fails to supply it. But Dooley and
co., being the crowd in power, should know
how to supply justice. Otherwise Dooley
is a fatted loafer, getting a liberal salary and
not giving value for it.
The Cook Government has seriously pro-
pounded the idea that £5,750,000 per annum
is too much to spend on the military and
naval defence of this continent, which is
about the size of Europe, and it proposes to
cheesepare £500,000 off it. If defence ex-
penditure goes by the amount of country to
be defended, the bill, according to European
ideas, would be a good many hundred mil-
lions. If it goes by population, the British
Isles are spending this year more per head
on naval defence alone than Australia is
doing on all its defences. And if it goes by
the amount of shed that the country is liable
to strike should its defences fail—well,
Britain’s worst immediate danger is that it
may be conquered by a highly civilised white
community which is its own brother by
descent, while Australia is up against races
alien in descent, color, religion and civilisa-
tion. The English nation, which is mostly
German itself, and is ruled by a German
royal family, might be improved by another
German conquest, which would merely turn
Smith into Schmidt. The Australian race
would be finished by Chinese or Jap con-
quest.
TOUJOURS TRIPE.
DAMNUISANCE VISITOR: "I s'pose you're glad the meat strike is over?"
OVERWORKED EDITOR : "Didn't affect us. The supply of tripe never fell off for an
instant! ”
It was a flabbergasted depu-
tation which waited on N.S.W.
Minister Hoyle to complain of
the increase in Sydney tram
fares. When the general elec-
tion was hanging in the balance,
an assurance was given that,
provided the Holman crowd was
returned to power, there would
be no such increase. The same
assurance had been given
earlier, but it was repeated.
Now that Holman and co. have
got back to power, and the in-
creased tramway fares are a
prominent feature on their pro-
gramme, some people, like the
man who called on young Bar-
nacle at the Circumlocution
Office, “want to know.” But
the beaming Government treats
the matter lightly, and dances
on the old promise with a light fantastic toe.
The work of enslaving Corn-
stalk posterity to the British
capitalist has resumed on
quite a large scale. The
N.S.W. public debt increased
between 1900 and 1912 from
£65,832,993 to £100,052,635,
which was an expansion of
£34,719,642, and might be
described as horrible enough.
Still there was a good point:
of the new borrowings
£22.254,987 were raised in
N.S.W., and only £12,464,655
in England. The one redeem-
ing feature about a public
debt is that it should be
locally owned and the interest
spent in the country, and the
fact that the proportion of
locally owned public debt in-
creased from £l5 14s. per cent,
in 1900 to £32 10s. per cent,
in 1912 was something to the
good. It was an attempt at
independence—in a small way.
But in 1913, the year of mad
finance New South Wales borrowed
£6,215,108 in England, while the amount of
debt held locally actually diminished. This
meant a huge addition to the tribute pay-
able by the slaves of the Ma State to their
owners in London. It seems hardly worth
while to fuss greatly about Botha deporting
a few South African strikers to England
when the Sydney Parliament is sending the
souls and prospects of its children there in
this heroic fashion. And if the alleged
platform of the N.S.W. Labor party has any
legal significance, then Louis Botha was
much the less conspicuous law-breaker of
the two.
“Dingbat” : There are no publichouses in
the King Country of Maoriland. Incident-
ally two men in all Maoriland drank them-
selves across the Jordan last year, and they
both did it in the King Country.
The strike of N.S.W. iron-workers was a
big affair, yet it attracted little attention
and passed away without causing an observ-
able ripple on the surface of events. Aus-
tralia’s iron-workers are not very well paid.
But then the tariff is low, and the imports
of cheap labor goods—including steel rails,
and dredges, and ships, and locomotives, and
trucks, and hairpins, and corkscrews, and
hobnails, and pens, and cranes, and tele-
graph wire, and galvanised iron, and fenders
and bedsteads —are enormous. So when the
Australian iron-worker wants better remu-
neration the boss simply lets him strike,
and turns importer, and cables to England
for another corkscrew and a fresh dredge
and a pint of hobnails.
THE GREAT DEADHEAD.
Mr. Holman, however, had one surprise, and that
was a remission of taxation to the extent of £7600,
the whole of which would be saved to the British
investor in New South Wales securities. In that
respect we think the remission was a wise one.

ORDINARY PAYING PASSEGER : "But who

CUT IT OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Senator M‘Coll, spouting at the Liberal Workers’
Institute (Melb.), said “he was afraid that model
Parliaments were going out of fashion. Yet 26
years ago Parliament was really a deliberative insti-
tution, and its work was well and faithfully done.
AVhen an Act was passed it generally stood. Now
the work is put through in a slipshod sort of way,
and it requires amendment after amendment. This
is all due to the cancer of the caucus.”
The Cancer of the Caucus was discovered by M'Coll,
Who fears the present Parliament must die,
The prospect of its mortal resurrection at the poll
Is not at all appealing to his eye.
The Cancer that he mentions stirs his soul with
apprehensions,
’Tis worse than kidney trouble or the gout.
Well, to meanings re that Cancer we have only got
one answer —•
Cut it out.
The Curse of Socialism seems an easy ill to bear:
Fat Tories do not dread it any more;
Taxation still has left them with a quid or two to
spare:
They ride around in motors a-s before.
A politician raucous, crying “Cancer of the
Caucus,”
May strike ’em with an unexpected clout;
At first the “gag” may funk ’em; but anon they’ll
murmur “Bunkum !
Cut it out.”
The Lady Leagues no longer speak of Labor as a
plot
To rob the naicest people of their gold.
They take the baby bonus, and have probably forgot
How they trembled for the Marriage Tie of old.
No fear of confiscation gives them further agitation ;
And thus will they reply without a doubt,
AVhen M'Coll is talking “Cancer” to a Toorak Tango
dancer—
“ Cut it out.”

Owing to the great popularity and increased out-
put of Continental tyres during the past season, the
Continental Rubber Co. announces another great price
reduction, particularly in regard to Oversize Tyres.
The company claims that Continental Oversizes" are
the only true Oversized tyres on the market, as not
only is the casing heavier, but the air space is also
bigger than any other tyre sold in Australasia. In
order to illustrate the faith that the company has
in the splendid qualities of oversizes, they undertake
that any claims on tyres showing a manufacturing
defect, will be adjusted by them on the basis of a
minimum of 4000 miles. The company assures motor-
ists that by fitting their tyres, they not only get
the best value for their money, but will have the
security of trading with a company whose reputa-
tion for fair-dealing is world-wide. Motorists de-

REGULARITY OF THE BOWELS.
THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE
AGAINST ILL-HEALTH.
When the bowels are clogged the waste
matter decays and ferments and enters the
blood and is carried to all parts of the body,
producing headaches, biliousness, sleepless-
ness, heartburn, loss of appetite, indigestion,
neuralgia, rheumatism and various other
ailments disturbing the heart and nervous sys-
tem ; and if continued is liable to cause in-
flammation of the bowels, liver and kidneys.
To maintain a healthy system the bowels
should operate at least once every 24 hours.
This is one of Nature’s wise provisions whicn
is too often ignored, and the result is untold
suffering. Women and children are
greatest offenders, but why such should be
the case is a problem to be solved. , a
family medicine I have found Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills very good indeed,” writes
Mrs. Mary Murphy, of 174 Beattie Street.
Balmain. “Personally, I have used Indian
Root Pills for indigestion and constipation,
and can say they came up to my expectations
in every sense, and I cannot speak to
highly of them. You have my consent t
use this testimony.”*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
The more Murray Aunger’s rush from
Melbourne to Adelaide is considered, the greater the
admiration it evokes. His dash across the Coorong
was wonderful. The ordinary motorist takes at
least six hours to get over the 92 miles between
Kingston and Meningie; but Aunger went through
like a whirlwind in two hours 42 minutes. He
had spied out the sand during the Dunlop Military
Relay contest in 1912, when he carried the despatch
from Adelaide to Kingston. He flew at top speed
on every patch of good road, and on one 10-mile
stretch of a dried-up lagoon he made 80 miles an
hour. In spite of his spurts of high speed he used
only 25 gallons of petrol, although his is a 25-h.p.
car. He had one very curious experience. He
was racing along at 70 miles an hour, and, turning
a corner, crashed into some loose, broken metal.
There was a terrific report from the front of the car,
and something flew past his head. When he got
down and examined his wheels the covers were
apparently all right, though one of them was flat.
A spare wheel was fitted and the run resumed.
When Aunger removed the deflated cover at Adelaide
he found that nine inches of the inside tube was
missing, but how it got out there was nothing to
show. Another motorist, passing, the spot where the
blow-out occurred, found nine inches of tube and sent
it along to Aunger. The only reasonable theory is
that the cover struck the metal sideways and the
impact forced the bead inwards. This allowed the
highly-inflated inside tube to protrude and blow up
balloon-like. The rebound of the cover-bead
into the clutch of the rim cut the tube,
which exploded and flew past Aunger’s head. If
anyone has a better theory let him fire it.

“0.K.”: The explanation of George Gray '3
defeat by Reece in the first heat for the Billiard
Championship is not the difference between ivory and
composition balls. The difference in the “take off”
of the ivories is considerable, but it is not so great
that Gray couldn’t adapt the strength of his stroke
to it. In fact, he had proved his mastery of the
ivories by making bigger breaks with them in
private practice than any English professional has
ever done. But he was nervous in his game with
Reece, as he had previously been nervous when he
failed to beat Newman in a match with bonzolines.
And the cause of young George Gray’s nervousness
should suggest itself to anyone who remembers how
the quiet, diligent boy practitioner had developed
into a dandified, pallid young man when he re-
appeared in Melbourne last year. His white silk
vest and superfine linen spoke eloquently. Said
Melbourne Inman, the man who achieved the
billiard championship not by superlative skill,
but by level-headed tactics: “During the cham-
pionship preliminary Gray struck the balls
with _ a greater or less jerk, compared with his
play in practice games. He had deteriorated 50 per
cent.” His nerves were unstrung. Well, he has a
full 12 months in which to get them braced up
again. George has missed the championship ’bus
for 1914.

The hold the trotting mania is
getting in Maoriland is shown by the fact
that at the Metropolitan Trotting Club’s
February meeting at Christchurch
£19,349 was rushed through the Tote in
the day ; while at the gallops run by the
C.J.C. at Riccarton the same week the
machine thaf Isaac Moses doesn’t love
took only £16,955. The meeting for light
harness horses was only a stop-gap, yet
the stakes amounted to £l5OO, and no
less than 111 trotters went to the post
for the eight races. The Metropolitan
Club, by the way, is the most important
in Maoriland, being the promoter of the
race, run every November, known as the
M.L. Trotting Cup, for which the stake
is £2OOO.

In the Orange Free State, rather
more than in other parts of S’Africa,
the name of the “gentleman amateurs” of
the M.C.C. cricket team is “Mud,” with a
capital M. Seems that the Mavor of
Bloemfontein and a crowd of 500 local
enthusiasts waited for more than an hour
at the railway station to give the Test
team a Conquering Heroes’ reception. But
Capt. Douglas and Bird, the other lead-
ing amateur light of the team, put on
arrogant airs of indifference as regards
th .® Worshipful Mayor and the reception-com-
mittee in general. After which, Bird, aggre-
gated the offence by knocking up 200 runs
against the O.F.S. bowling. AVhereupon a
local paper published somebody’s open letter
to Douglas and Bird, in which the writer quoted
what a recent article in the National Review had
raid about the “detestable manners” of certain Eng-
lish tourists, known as Thank Gods, because they
are eternally thanking the Almighty for their
nationality. Said the Nat. Review of the T.G.’s:
“A few of them are sufficient to turn a loyal'com-
munity into a community of Anglophobes—yes, even
'hough nine out of 10 members are English, or born
of English parents.” Apparently the awful insult
'o the Mayor was only one of many sins debited to
Douglas and Bird. The open-letter writer stated:
In the few weeks you have been in S’Africa your
manners off the field have been as bad, and vour
•elf-satisfied conceit as insufferable as the play of
'he gentlemen professionals who form the majority
of your team has been brilliant. Before you arrived
m Bloemfontein I had stories of some of your
pretensions to lord it over ‘the beastly colonial’-
but I did not believe all I heard. Now I am in-
clined to believe it all.”

Some queer cycle records have been dug
up in Fogland lately. Some years ago a cyclist
whose name has unfortunately been forgotten, under-
took to ride 100 miles every week-dav for a year, and
actually accomplished the feat. But a still more
remarkable record has been unearthed. It seems
that for the past 20 years a man well known in
the cycle industry. F. J. Lucas, of Coventry, has
been riding 50 miles a day. He has covered the
awful distance of 305,000 miles since September,
1893, when he first started to ride to Wolverhampton
and Northampton on alternate days. He should be
on intimate terms with every stone on those two
roads by this time.
The automatic aeroplane seems to be on
the way at last. Orville Wright announced re-
cently that he had perfected a fool-proof flier with
a mechanical stabiliser operated by electricity that
made reasonably safe flight possible for everybody.
Now a Dr. Robiola, of Turin, claims to have per-
fected an automatically controlled hydro-plane, con-
structed throughout of metal and weighing about a
ton, which he claims is fool-proof, uncapsizable, and
capable of hurling itself through the atmosphere at
over 150 miles an hour. There’ll certainly be some-
thing doing in the air shortly if these claims are
substantiated at the public trial to take place in
Italy soon. An all-metal aeroplane is a step in the
right direction, for, if the 200 miles an hour dreamed
of by present bird-men is to become an accomplished
fact, the machine that does it will have to be
much more substantial than the present flimsy affairs.
Also, the bird-man that rides the infernal thing at
200 miles an hour will have to be enclosed in some
manner. At 200 miles an hour he could not breathe.
If he opened his mouth he would be s> othered. This
is a fact worth mentioning to any inventor going
out on his 200 miles per hour contraption.

Adelaide is going to surprise itself by
encouraging Rugby football. The Soccer enthusiasts
have gained a good footing lately, but the other has
been seen only once every seven years or so, when a
game has been got up for some visiting warship.
Then the few onlookers derided the small playing-
space, describing the scrimmages as slow, and con-
demned tackling as brutality. However, there are
now so many residents who have played Rugby in
N.S.W. or Maoriland or England that a regular
start is being made. Humphreys and Sorensen are
perhaps the best-known men available, but there is
plenty of material. League, not Union, rules are to
be followed. There is at present no hope of attract-
ing gate money, unless perhaps when an English
team passes through.

his belt. McGoorty, though born in Wisconsin
(U.S.A.), wore the green harp of Erin and the
Stars and Stripes on the belt that held up his
Scott gives it to McGoorty , and the sports go sour
emerald-green disguise. There was a curious simi-
larity about the boxers. They were of the same
type. McGoorty appeared to be a larger, more fleshy
replica of Smith. And Smith looked like a Greek
god of the days when Greece had gods, which was
before it took to the fish-shop industry. There never
was a god in Greece who went by the name of Smith,
but that is a detail.
As Smith advanced he came to the crouch, and
seemed to lose range by doing so. McGoorty, wrapped
in calm assurance and some clothes, with a debonair
expression on his cheerful countenance, advanced in
the straight, standing, old Jem Mace style. Smith
led suddenly with the left, and like a flash over
came Eddie’s right. Smith danced away lightly, and
no one knew whether he was hit or not. Somebody
remarked it was only a feeler, but Smith’s blow had
left a faint mark. Then, as they came together
again, McGoorty smote hard and straight. Smith
bent down, the blows went wild, and Smith came
up inside and sent the right three times to the heart.
McGoorty -uished him off, and again Smith’s left
flashed out and flicked McGoorty on the cheekbone.
Eddie’s right arrived just here like a sledgehammer,
and caught Smith as he danced away. But he felt
it. McGoorty crowded in and sent his blows rapidly,
Smith dodged many, but he stopped some that hurt
—and it was McGoorty’s round. The second found
Smith elusive and clever to sensationalism. And he
had need to be. There was downfall in every second
blow McGoorty let fly. He seemed to tower over
Smith, and it looked unequal. Smith (the
writer hates to be always saying “Smith,”
but it can’t be helped) was a game fox-
terrier against a bull-dog, and in spite of all
his speed and cleverness he stopped blow after blow.
They were straight drives and when Smith dodged
them he would spring in and stab with the left.
But McGoorty would take those stabs like thistle-
down, and his right would come over and catch the
retreating Smith every time and send him spinning
like a top. Whether Smith was hurt no one could
say. His countenance never changed. The statue
was alive in every part barring the face —that was
as expressionless as marble. In the third round
McGoorty fled at Smith. Smith ducked and his
head went under McGoorty’s arm, and Eddie in the
heat of battle “rabbited” his opponent’s neck. The
population sprang to its feet with a snarl and a
curse, and the walls of the Stadium bent outwards
before the blast of hooting. The boxers never
heeded, but swirled round the ring each looking for
an opening. Suddenly McGoorty hooked, and as
Smith spun away he nearly lost his balance, and
men gasped as they saw his right eye puff and half
close. But he recovered himself in a flash and as
McGoorty came in with his gun loaded for bear
Smith ducked, drove three heavy ones to the heart,
and then tried to uppercut. But the man’s arc of
vision had been reduced by about one half, and
McGoorty set to work to close the left optic. Then
he suddenly changed and getting his left hook home
twice on the face of the flying Smith he closed the
damaged eye right up. Following up his advantage
he punished hard and frequently. Smith’s
career showed signs of an early close. People
thought he was going into liquidation, and that he
wouldn’t pay much in the £. That was the first
phase of the fight.
The second phase commenced when, by use of the
lancet and some astringent, Smith recaptured his right
eye, somewhere about the fifth round. After that he
began to coruscate. He evaded McGoorty’s rushes,
dodged his hooks, and had a habit of being absent
when the enemy wanted him. He would heave his
left into McGoorty’s face and then clinch, and
wrestling for an opportunity, send his right on to
the region of McGoorty’s heart, after which he would
swing his body to the right and send his left up
towards McGoorty’s chin. Slowly that battery began
to tell, and a lot of those sudden upward jerks knocked
Eddie’s head backwards, so that he acquired an up-
ward and prayerful expression. But in spite of his
many misses, he was always the attacking party,
and Smith’s cleverness was, after all, only the clever-
ness of defence. In the light of what happened that
is worth remembering. In the seventh McGoorty
tried to uppercut, but missing with his fist nearly
slew Smith’s nose with his forearm. The nose
wasn’t quite dead, but McGoorty was warned for
his carelessness. By this time it became
apparent that Smith was the popular
favorite. When he shook his head the
crowd cheered. When he hit it bel-
lowed with delight. When McGoorty
missed some of it howled derision and
made cat-calls, and tried to imitate the
sound of boiled ham in the distance. A
weariful person whom somebody had for-
gotten to kill laughed in a cracked fal-
setto all the time. He sounded like a tin
horn blowing in Hell. When McGoorty
presumed to hit Smith he was jeered and
had his legitimacy questioned. Between
the row and the shadowy elusiveness of
Smith, McGoorty had a bad time. In
the 10th round he failed to land a single
blow, while Smith scored repeatedly with
a beautiful left —but he always hung on
to McGoorty at the end of each contact.
In the 13th the Stadium authorities
endeavored to stop the hooting, and per-
sons wearing the outward semblance of
humanity were ordered to either behave
themselves or go out. The second phase
of the fight ended with the 13th.
The sound of the gong in the 14th
saw McGoorty come out and land two
heavy straight lefts that fairly staggered
Smith. He hung on. McGoorty punched
him off, and followed up with another
snappy left. Smith swung a heavy right
that drove McGoorty back, and then he
came in again, and, hitting quicker than
he had hitherto done, he slogged Smith
a left, a right and a left. In the 15th
McGoorty again cut loose, and, anticipat-
ing Smith’s dash, crossed with the right
to the nose, and followed up and bashed
on the body. Incidentally, a large block
of city property fell on his own nose and
hurt that organ. But his longer reach
seemed to be beating Smith badly. In
a clinch in the 16th Smith got in some
fierce uppercuts that gave McGoorty par
ticular annoyance. Then the Greek deity
would break away and take refuge in flight,
and McGoorty would set all sail in pursuit. In the
17th McGoorty seemed to go suddenly weak. He
appeared to lose his speed, and Smith continued to
hit and clinch amidst thunders of applause. And in
the clinches he let fly a whole series of uppercuts.
One of these caught McGoorty on the point. He
reeled against the ropes, stood apparently helpless,
and looked like a derelict on the high seas. The crowd
with what voice it had left, howled to Smith to go
in and finish him. McGoorty looked like a bullock
awaiting the final stroke. But Smith thought it
was all gammon, so he approached cautiously and
seemed afraid to go close. With a supreme effort
McGoorty gathered himself together, and lifting his
carcase with both hands, threw it bodily at his
enemy. The enemy evading, McGoorty careered on into
space. He recovered himself by catching hold of the
rope, and once more faced what should have been
his doom. And all the time he was recovering
rapidly, and he managed to evade till the gong went.
In the 18th he was still groggy, and resorted to the
straight left to keep Smith off. He hurled it in
with all his weight behind it, only to find Smith’s
head tucked under his arm. But some of his bashes
got home and shook the opposition badly. In the
19th he was practically himself again, and he fell
on the foe in magnificent style. He went baresark,
and every time Smith got home with the left
McGoorty caught him with the right, till in the end
the man with the short name hung on for sheer life.
It was easily McGoorty’s round. An odor of cham-
pagne preceded the 20th gong, and then McGoorty
once more cut loose. He strained every nerve for a
knock-out, and the other fellow hung on desperately
at times and dodged wonderfully at other times.
When Mac got home it sounded just like the great
meat strike. Then the gong went, and Scott, with-
out a moment of hesitation, placed his hand on
McGoorty’s head like a blessing on the day of Pente-
cost.
Then things happened. First, there was a ton of
silence, also miles and miles of calm. It might have
been a funeral. This peaceful arrangement was
broken when a weedy sort of man leaped from the
£2 seats to the ringside and howled epithets at
referee Scott. He was full of howl, and he emptied
himself. At last Scott glanced at him and made
through the ropes. That weed stood in danger of
being killed ; but the journalists seized Scott, while
others dragged the weed to safety. By this time
the Stadium was filled with an awful noise. Hun-
dreds started to kick the iron walls in fury. One of
Smith’s seconds swarmed over to where the press-
men stood round Scott—and was pushed back. From
far and near the white-coated ushers came streaming
to the storm centre. It was impossible for a man to
hear his own creditors. Up in the ring Jeff Smith
bowed and tried to make a speech, but the applause
of his admirers choked him. Heaven only knows
the whyness of all this fuss. The present writer
thought Smith won, but not by so expansive a
margin as has been widely credited to him.
The things that counted against him were the fact
that, for a majority of rounds, he fought a purely
defensive fight; he hung on to avoid punishment;
and when he had McGoorty apparently defeated and
badly rattled he would not or could not finish him.
The things that counted for him were the fact that
he scored a majority of blows; that he showed more
skill; that he fought the cleaner fight; that he
caused McGoorty to miss fully 65 per cent, of his
shotsand once had McGoorty all but done. No
doubt the thing that reckoned most against him in
the eyes of the referee was that he fought a
defensive fight all through. Which was true —but
it must not be forgotten it was effective defence.
Anyhow, it will be a long-remembered battle.
As it is considered unwise, in the face of such a
demonstration, to put Scott back in the Stadium
ring as referee, for some time, at any time, Harold
Baker will act. This writer extends him the sincere
and cordial sympathy of himself and the other pug-
reporters. It is a sorry billet. The most remarkable
feature of the upheaval is that it is the first time in
the memory of the Oldest Inhabitant that the sport-
ing or pug press has been unanimous. The Stadium
wishes it to be understood that in making the change
it is not reflecting in any way on the ability or
integrity of Mr. Scott—it merely says that his idea
of what constitutes a victory is so opposed to the
popular ideal that some change is necessary in the
interests of the Stadium and the public. In other
words, the howl was too much for the management


MY HEALTH EXERCISES
PERMANENTLY CURE INDIGESTION.
Indigestion is NOT caused by the food you
eat. It is purely the result of a stomach
that has been ill-used —that has been shame-
fully neglected—that has been allowed to
rust, through want of exercise.
Very few people overeat. If the muscles
of the stomach are of normal strength, your
food will give j ou every particle of its nour-
ishing qualities.
My Health Exercises, for banishing indi-
gestion, quickly build up and strengthen the
muscles which govern the stomach —make
them easily able to assimilate the food —give
nourishment to every part of the body. Be
guided by the experience of others who’ve
benefited.

I feel much stronger in every way, and get
better health. I used to suffer from indi-
gestion, but have not been troubled for some

The Beauty Experts
WHAT THE BEST OF THEM HAVE
TO SAY ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS
HOME RECIPES.
The Killing of
Superfluous Hair.
"Boudoir Gossip.”
To is easy to remove superfluous hair temporarily,
out to remove it permanently is quite another
matter. Not many women know that for this pur-
pose such a simple substance as powdered pheminol
may be used, applied directly to the hair. The
recommended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly remove the hair, hut also to eventually
kill the roots entirely. Almost any chemist could
supply an ounce of pheminol, which quantity should
he sufficient. * * * A simple way to quickly neutral-
ise disagreeable body odors is to dust the armpits
occasionally with powdered (white) pergol. * * *
The use of the natural allacite of orange blossoms
as a greaseless cream is becoming prevalent among
the smartest women. It holds the powder perfectly,
gives a delightful cool finish to the skin, and does
not encourage the growth of hair.
Oxygen as a
Complexion Remover.
“Things One Should Know.”
The latest scientific method of improving the com-
plexion is to “take from it instead of adding to it.”
The idea is to remove, by a gentle process of oxidisa-
tion all the stifling and half-dead accumulations which
adhere to the skin in the form of sallowness, moth
patches, liver spots, etc. The application of merco-
lised wax for a few nights in the same manner that
cold cream is applied, soon produces marked results.
In contact with the skin this wax releases free
oxygen, which destroys the waste matter but does
not affect the healthy tissue in the least. The re-
moval of the deadened and disfiguring waste matter
reveals the beautiful young complexion which every
woman has just underneath the stained outer one.
The mercolised wax, as supplied by chemist shops, is
perfectly harmless and very beneficial to the skin.
* * * To bring a natural red color to the lips rub
them with a soft stick of prolactum. * * * For
tired, hot or perspiring feet use a tcaspoonful of
powdered onalite in a foot bath.
The Magnetism of
Beautiful Hair.
“Applied Arts.”
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the personal mag-
netism of both men and women. Actresses and smart
women are ever on the lookout for any harmless thing
that will increase the natural beauty of their hair.
The latest method is to use pure stallax as a shampoo
on account of the peculiarly glossy, fluffy and wavy
effect which it leaves. As stallax has never been used
much for this purpose it comes to the chemist only
in sealed original packages, enough for 25 or 30
shampoos. A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax
granules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very beneficial
and stimulating to the hair, apart from its beautify-
ing effect. * * * For an actual hair-grower nothing
equals pure boranium. It is quite harmless, and sets
the hair roots tingling with new life. * *-* The use
of rouge is almost always obvious, but powdered
colliandum gives a perfectly natural color and defies
detection.
The Powder Puff Passes.
“Boudoir Talks.”
Every normal woman is always interested in any
plan by which she can quickly enhance her beauty,
provided the plan is perfectly safe and simple. Ever
since the discovery that ordinary cleminite, such as
any chemist can supply, is an instantaneous and
harmless beautifier, there has been a growing demand
for it from smart women everywhere. They usually
get about an ounce and add just enough water to
dissolve it. A little of this perfectly harmless lotion
gives a beautiful complexion to any face instantly.
It renders face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover,
its use cannot be detected. The skin is instantly
beautified, but appears perfectly natural under the
closest scrutiny. * * * To make the eyelashes
grow long, dark and curling, apply a little mennalinc
with the finger-tips occasionally. It is absolutely harm-
less and beautifies the eyebrows as well. * * *Pilenta
soap is the most satisfactory for all complexions. It
even works well in cold or hard water.

S. Australia’s Agricultural College at Roseworthy
announces the worst wheat harvest it has ever
handled. Though only 30 miles from Adelaide, the
college is in a tract that most rains somehow miss ;
and a Roseworthy-trained farmer is expected to make
things grow anywhere. Last year, however, the
normal 171 inches came down to 151, and even that
was badly timed—a dry winter, followed by an un-
usually wet spring, with red rust resulting. Says
Professor Perkins cheerfully: “If there was one thing
this visitation did well, it was to settle once for all
the credentials of many a so-called rust-resistant
variety. In the long run, there were few varieties
on the college farm that did not suffer more or less
severely from the attacks of the disease.” As for hay,
it dwindled down to a miserable lCcwt. to the acre.

“Garboard Strake” : A Sydney paper which doesn’t
know much about shipping says that the Shipping
Ring makes the Government “tremble.” The Ship-
ping Ring makes the traveller “tremble,” and by
the look of things it is going to do it some more,
presently. The fares from Ma’s congested City are
fairly high as things fall to-day. They will be
higher presently. A return ticket from Sydney to
Brisbane costs five guineas; from Sydney to'Adelaide
£7 75., and from Sydney to Fremantle £l5 15s.
What is wanted is a rate war, such as periodically
occurs in the Atlantic trade. In the last “war,”
which commenced in January, some of the “cuts”
were amazing, but they were nothing to the drop in
fares of the “wars” of 1907 and 1904. In this
latter war it was possible to travel from Liverpool to
New York, via Great Grimsby and Hamburg, for
£2, and to return, by the White Star Line to Lon-
don, via Liverpool, for £3. This meant a journey
of about 17,000 miles by land and sea, about 76
meals, and no fewer than 19 nights’ sleeping accom-
modation for £5! These “wars” are almost in-
variably started by the huge Hamburg-America Co.,
which boasts itself to be the largest Shipping Jonah
in the world, and in which the German Emperor is
a big shareholder, and, unofficially, a director. The
Co. is always bumping its great rival, the North
German Lloyd Co., which has mostly been inclined
to work in with the English cos. and leave the
“cutting” path for the “pooling” and profitable one.
“Lubber”: Is “Rangan” (B. 5/3/’l4) correct in
saying that pilots make only a fiver a week? I know
that when I was living in Williamstown (V.) we
all supposed the pilots to make not less than £6OO
a year. Who’s right?

Melbourne Argus lately tackled a subject larger
than it understood —the fertilising of worn-out lands.
It explained lengthily and more or less abstrusely
that there were four methods of . doing this, some
feasible, some otherwise, and was proceeding to
expatiate on one particular method which it favored
when a casual farmer up at Woodend briefly re-
marked that the four methods were in reality one—
the returning to the soil of the ingredients taken
from it, by passing them through stock instead of
selling the fodder off the farm. lie went on to
point out that by exporting annually some 300,000
tons of wheat, instead of first turning it into flour
by local manufacture, Victoria was sending away
yearly 60,000 tons of bran and pollard, which, when
fed to stock, had a fertiliser value of £3 per ton.
At this stage the Argus, which doesn’t care much
about local manufactures, dropped the subject.
According to a witness before the Inter-State Com-
mission the Melbourne Paper Merchants were pledged,
as business gentlemen, to charge the non-associated
printers 35 per cent, more than their associated
brethren. However, one paper-importing firm, being
compelled under the agreement to disclose its price
to Typothet* committee, got around its honorable
understanding by arranging that witness should order
and receive a large quantity, but should only be
charged for a small quantity. Thus do “honorable
understandings,” “gentlemen’s agreements,” etc., etc.,
operate in the realms of commerce to cause dog to
eat dog.
“8.J.”: He put in an appearance at the Lockjaw
post-office about 11 o’clock one morning, and desired
to know if there was a telegram for him. He said
his name was Palestein, and there was no outward
and visible reason why it shouldn’t be. He called
four times during the day on the off-chance of finding
a message for him. He looked in again in the even°-
mg, when it happened that there was a telegram.
He read it. “Goodt grathiouth !” he exclaimed, “thith
ith from my brother to thay that my houth hath been

Hamer : A horrible understanding, or whatever
the captains of industry like to call it, is a pleasant
and a beautiful thing. The pickle manufacturers
used to have one, and may have it now—l don’t know
because I lost whatever interest I had in pickles after
I relinquished my job as accountant, cashier, ledger-
keeper, etc., with a firm which, amongst other things,
made pickles. The price of pickles had been fixed
by the beastly understanding, and most of the manu-
facturer’s early hours at the office used to be spent
m listening to his travellers’ tales of how they had
secured orders from Bloggs and Co. or Sugar and
Sandy bv _ offering a special discount on that price.
But occasionally his serenity was disturbed—-as, for
example, when one of his travellers discovered that
the traveller of a rival pickle manufacturer had
bagged some trade by agreeing not to charge, or to
considerably reduce the charge, for packing. Then
did the telephone vibrate with indignation. The
horrified manufacturer rang up the delinquent firm
and talked hotly about “honorable” conduct and the
word of gentlemen ; and a meeting of the parties to
the horrible thing was hurriedly called. The manu-
facturer who owned my valuable services was the
president of the association which made the under-
standing, and consequently he could call a meeting
whenever he felt furious enough. If ever he was
bowled out himself he invariably put the blame on
his travellers, and said he would make the responsi-
ble paity sit up ; but, as far as I know, they were
always permitted to go on lying. Incidentally, when
he was bowled out he didn’t call a meeting.
WON’T YOU BUY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A desperate wail from the S. M. Herald :—-
YOUNG MAN, 24, artistic and intellectual tastes,
travelled, enterprising, manifold capabilities, urgently
needs Employment of any nature. Prepared even to
sell himself to any person for any occupation for
any period.—OMAß, G.P.0., Sydney.
Here’s a chap of twenty-four,
Hale and hearty to the core.
With a glint of youth and gladness in his eye;
He has mighty little treasure,
But he owns a lot of leisure,
And he’s up to-day for auction. Will you buy?
He is agile and artistic,
He can fight a battle fistic,
Coach the kiddies, shear the muttons w T et or dry;
And he stands beneath the hammer,
And he pines to hear the clamor
Of the “Going, going, going.” Will you buy?
If his style your eye engages,
’Twill be easy fixin’ wages ;
Thump his back and feel his biceps—don’t be shy ;
He is neither slouch nor sawney,
He is brainy—he is brawny—-
And the highest bidder takes him. Won't you buy?
Such a genius manifold
You but seldom may behold,
And he only waits employment. Will you try?
Work? Oh, that’s another thing.
Work! Is that the song you sing?
Why, he only wants employment. Will you buy?

A FEW FACTS ABOUT
r
A/sf
MftSltll:
’/2 Watt.
Mazda Half-Watt Lamps
(1) The “ Half=Watt ” Lamp is a new form of drawn wire tungsten lamp, developed and
perfected in the research laboratories of the General Electric Co. (U.S.A.) and its
associated Companies.
(2) It is not the result of a chance discovery, but the outcome of two years patient work.
(3) fIAZDA “ Half=Watt ” Lamps have an efficiency twice as high as that of the best
ordinary metal (tungsten) filament lamps.
(4) The intrinsic brilliancy of the MAZDA “ Half=Watt” Lamp is eight times that of
the ordinary tungsten filament lamp. The light is much whiter and approximates
very closely to daylight.
(5) MAZDA “ Half=Watt ” Lamps are adaptable to all voltages, either direct or
alternating current, and suited to any commercial frequency.
(6) The average useful life (before the lamp loses 20 per cent, of its initial candle
power) is 1,000 hours.

The only way to keep
cool and vigorous in the
hot weather is to keep
the system cleansed.
Kriischen Salts re-
move Uric Acid, brace
and stimulate the body
and remedy all liver and
kidney troubles, Gout,
Rheumatism and Lum-
bago.
The stomach and
kidneys are frequently
thrown out of gear by
the heat, and the first
symptoms of disorder
Keep cool!
must on no account be
ignored.
Take every morning,
on rising, a half-tea-
spoonful of Kriischen
Salts in a tumbler of hot
water.
Headache, undue
fatigue, loss of appetite,
indigestion, lack of
spirits, are put to rout
by Kriischen Salts, and
in their place will come
the clear vision, the
energy, the buoyant
vitality and the joyous
glow of radiant health.
Not a Fizzy Drink
Kriischen Salts are not
effervescent, and therefore do
not cause flatulence. They
can be taken with perfect
comfort by the vast number
of people whom gaseous and
aerated mixtures do not suit.
Krtischen Salts do not
spur the body to any un-
natural activity; they help
it to perform its natural
functions by supplying the
salts which are essential to
health.
The Case of Rheumatism or Gout
which Kriischen Salts cannot
benefit has yet to be discovered.
Doctors, at home and
abroad, prescribe Kriis-
chen Salts —and what is
more —use it them-
selves. When the sys-
tem’s balance is upset
by the heat of the
summer Kruschen Salts
will preserve and restore
the proper working of
all the organs. From
October to March,
Kruschen Salts keep the
blood cool, and the
whole human mechan-
ism tuned to the highest
pitch of efficiency.
The regular use of
these famous salts will
clear away depression
and worry and give you
a feeling of happiness
and vigour that makes
life worth living.
After all, health’s
everything.

Blind Justice.
One of those things which inspires the
public with a profound distrust, not to say
disrespect, of the law is the weird uncer-
tainty of it. A malefactor may rob a till
and get six months, or a fine, or he may
escape altogether as an alleged first offender.
Two persons may commit flagrant perjury,
and while one goes unassailed the other
may be prosecuted to such good purpose
that a scandalised judge hands him a stiff
term of penal servitude. The Law, though
it doesn’t admit it, hates one form of per-
jury like poison, while it condones, if it
doesn’t actually encourage, another form.
Abortionists are rarely proceeded against,
and vendors of adulterated milk are let
down lightly when they are detected; yet
other classes of murderers are assailed
mercilessly ; as are the proprietors of “two-
up” schools, fortune-tellers, motorists who
tarvel with their tail-lights out, and
dog-owners who omit to register their
animals. The student who examines closely
into the whole illogical situation will find
that the responsible factor is chiefly the
Law’s absurd respect for the rights of pro-
perty as distinguished from all other human
rights. It doesn’t object particularly to a
woman perjuring herself in defence of her
reputation for chastity; but it becomes sim-
ply infuriated if she does it for the purpose
of protecting her reputation for honesty.
Its emissaries will break into a den of sup-
posed coiners, and arrest everybody present
and impound their implements; yet no squad
of police ever raided the abode of a certain
Sydney doctor who notoriously earned his
entire living, for many years, by procuring
abortions. A few minutes before begin-
ning this article the writer had been looking
through aS. Australian daily paper. In it
were reported half a dozen cases of theft,
the perpetrators of which aggregated between
them the tidy total of 19 years penal ser-
vitude. In another part of the same paper
was set out the evidence in the matter of
Mrs. Eva Longbottom, of Brentwood
(S.A.), who was charged with ill-treating a
State child. An inspectress for the State
Children’s Department testified that she
examined Eva Le Raye, aged 14. and in the
employ of Mrs. Longbottom, and found
Over 36 bruises on her arms, legs and thighs. In
one place the bruises were so many and so close
together that she could not distinguish one from
the other.
The inspectress went on: —
I called Mrs. Longbottom (who was not present
when I examined the child) and ashed what she had
to say to this shameful illtreatment. When she
saw the state of the child she said, “Oh ! Eva, I had
no idea you were marked like that —there were no
bruises there when we went bathing on Sunday week.”
The child said, “You have done them since Sunday.”
Mrs. Longbottom told her that she did not think
she had given the girl as many as 80 strokes, but
she acknowledged that the number had been over 40,
and that she had punished the girl until she had
been unable to give her any more.
After some more evidence had been taken,
including the testimony of a head inspector
touching the discovery by him “of a per-
manent swelling on the girl’s right hand and
a considerable area of the scalp denuded of
hair,” the magistrates retired to consider
their verdict. The sentence was not six
months gaol without the option, nor even
three or one. It was a paltry £5 fine—a
penalty which is about as useful, regarded
as a deterrent, to the class of female who
employs State children, as the possibility of
a severe clerical chiding would be to a
habitual burglar. There may be all sorts of
extenuating circumstances in a case of theft
—hunger; sickness in the family; or immi-
nent bankruptcy, which may be warded off
by the acquisition of a few sovereigns. There
is no justification in the world for the. tor-
ture of a small child. Few are. ever injured
irreparably by having a portion of their
property torn from them. Eva Le Raye,
as a result of the treatment she has endured
at the hands of Mrs. Longbottom, will pro-
bably be prejudiced, as to her nerves, spirit
and character, for life. And Justice con-
siders that a £5 fine is sufficient to purge a
wanton crime of that magnitude. It is this
sort of thing that makes one realise that
Justice is indeed blind —perhaps blind drunk.
♦
In the old pre-Federal days each Australian
State thought it necessary to have a com-
plete astronomical observatory, just as it was
and still is thought necessary to have a sepa-
rate and exclusive Governor. Had the six
States pooled their money and installed one
first-class star-gazing foundry, with modern
equipment, at some inland station, observa-
tions might have been made which would
have caused the scientific world to sit up and
look interested. As it was, each State in-
sisted on its own tin-pot show, and stuck it
in the capital city—usually as near the main
streets as possible. Consequently the trams,
trains, dust and smoke all took a part in the
business and made it look worth about two
kangaroo tails. Now, the Commonwealth is
invited, in a tentative sort of way, to take
over the six star-gazing outfits. And this
hesitating or surreptitious invitation has
drawn its attention to the folly of the whole
complication. The stars won’t run away, so
there is no hurry about them. And there is
no reason why six men should look through
six inferior telescopes at one comet, when
one man, looking through one hig telescope
at one comet, might get a better view of the
same old comet, which is of no use to us in
any case, it being neither eatable, drinkable
nor saleable. A first-class observatory on the
Macdonnell Ranges, where the air is clear
and the passing tramcar doesn’t shake the
telescope to blazes, would satisfy everybody.

The elaborate arrangements on the part of
Maoriland’s “backbone” to break the water-
side crowd, recently on strike, appear to
have crumpled up. The M.L. Dairyman
breaks the news :
If any of our readers are now deluding themselves
that the farmers beat the strikers, we would like
them forever to banish this thought from their minds.
Every day some young farmer comes to us to say
that he has “chucked” it. No man can stand the
eternal and incessant pin-pricking, and the everlast-
ing use of the term “scab.” In a few more weeks
there will not be a farmer on any wharf in M.L.
After that things will be exactly as they were before
the strike, with this difference: The Red Feds and
the Ded Feds, and the various other brands of water-
side “shirkers” have their “knives into” all and
sundry connected with the land, and they are only
biding their time when they can pay back with in-
terest the injury that was done them in 1913 by the
farmers’ action in coming to town and breaking the
strike....As the truth is always sufficient for us, we
proclaim it now: The waterside is again in possession
of the old gang as it was before the strike.

IN BANANA LAND
“Rangan”: “Bishop” Barnes reiterates
Denham’s statements that he is not fright-
ened of the Meat Trust. Nobody wishes to
charge Bananaland’s Tory Government with
being frightened of the trusts. On the con-
trary, what everybody wants to know is, is
it friendly with them? In the last Parlia-
mentary session the Tories showed their so-
called democratic inclinations. Firstly, the
amended Companies Act, which gave big
concessions to the large P. Enterprise con-
cerns, was only amended after a very severe
fight by the Labor party. Again, the Bris-
bane Tramway Co. received an extension
without any definite basis of recompense
should the Local Authorities wish to take
over. Hence any old price can be charged
for goodwill, etc. Also, the Sugar Cane
Price Board’s Bill, which met with strong
opposition from the C.S.R., became the
hollowest of mockeries, and was suddenly
marooned. Then during the Ferricks libel
case, Denham received £2OOO, with word of
more to follow if it was wanted. With a
bland smile Denham declared that he had no
idea where it came from. Neither have I,
but it didn’t come from the Coal Lumpers’
Union or the Associated Cab-drivers.
“Thelma”: The Maryborough (Q.) City
Cou'ncil introduced several novelties into
the election of its Mayor this year. When
the council met after the annual elections in
accordance with the Act, a member of the
Labor party was proposed as fur wearer,
both his proposer and seconder stating in
their speeches that they would much prefer
the Mayor to be chosen by the ratepayers
rather than by the councillors. This pro-
position was eventually agreed to, with one
dissentient. The meeting then adjourned for
11 days after four candidates had been
nominated. As it was pointed out, there
was nothing to bind the aldermen to support
the candidate at the head of the poll, so a
motion was first carried, with the same one
dissentient, that the aldermen agree to abide
by the decision of the ratepayers’ ballot. The
poll was duly taken and resulted: Dunn,
443; White, 381; Blackley, 251; Holbutt,
22. When the council resumed its adjourned
meeting on the day following the poll, some
of the aldermen who were disappointed at
the result refused to acept the verdict and
keep their word pledged at the previous meet-
ing because the person at the head of the poll
IT IS A LONG WORM THAT
HAS NO TURNING.
MRS. COCKY: “There ain't one of 'em worth wot you're askin'. I haven't been buyin'
calicoes goin' on 40 year for nothin'."
STOREKEEPER (exasperated, but cold): “No, mum! But it ain't your fault if you 'aven't."
had not obtained an absolute majority of
votes cast, though it was pointed out that
the objecting aldermen had only the pre-
vious fortnight been themselves returned on
a minority vote, and that nothing had been
said at the previous meeting about an abso-
lute majority. However, after some bitter
speeches, Alderman Dunn was elected by
five to four.
“Caber”: Reference to Ebenezer Thorne
(B. 5/3/T4) brings the mind back to the
early ’Bo’s when Ebenezer was running the
Southern World. Arthur Morgan, who
was then running the Warwick Argus,
clipped a bit of something Ebenezer had
written in his lucid moments, and, as was
then the custom, omitted to acknowledge the
source. Thorne thereupon accused Morgan
of stealing other people’s brains, and Morgan
retorted that anyway he didn’t steal other
people’s calves. (Some time before a jury
had acquitted Ebenezer of having put his
brand on somebody else’s calf when he was
ruralising on the Logan.) The usual writ
for £lOOO or thereabouts followed, and
Morgan promptly apologised. But Isambert,
of the Zeitung, who had innocently copied
the calf joke, refused to climb down and
was cast into £5O damages and several hun-
dreds costs.
In Time of Drought.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is three years since I have seen a rose
And 1 am always dreaming of them now ;
The way the pleated petals will unclose
As when wide-skirted maidens make their
bow.
Blushing and dipping to the Queen of Day,
So the rose spreads, as crisply gowned as
they!
Brown are the paddocks, grassless, cracked
and bare.
Cloudless the sky, no storm-hint in the East,
But in the lambing paddock over there
The crows are gathering for their daily feast,
And tott’ring sheep reel in with sagging
flank
And fall along the trodden water tank.
The roof of iron is crackling with the heat;
Stench of dead cattle fills the brazen air,
And in my brain the fever-pulses beat
Whiles are the fever visions kind and fair.
Dreams of grey pastures where the faint
mist lies.
And falling rain... .above the buzzing flies.
I shut my eyes and turn the pillow o’er,
Across my room there breaks a hedge of May !
White, dewy blossoms laid to Spring’s wide
door
To lure Love's feet along the bridal way,
And in the shadow of the sighing trees
A lily lifts her cup.. . .a-spill with bees.
The white ants left no trace of green leaf
here
E’en had the drought curse spared it for
our eyes,
The shy bush birds forget their primal fear
And, swooning ’neath the sun-frown of the
skies,
Come flutt’ring weakly to the cistern’s brink
Daring the hlood feud that they may but
drink!
Ah, smell the May! Is it not fragrant, cool?
And hear the tinkling waters caught beyond,
Below the fallen tree there is a pool
Whose surface mirrors many a quivering
frond.
So deep and clean, and unforgot, it lies—
To bathe in that green pool were Paradise !
Beneath the ripple-rings are waving weeds.
And here and there a fish with silver scale.
That from some stealthy corner darts and
feeds,
Ilis wide fins vivid in his coat of mail,
While slipping lightly from a sly carouse
The crayfish saunters to his muddy house...
Along the edges of the little pool.
An ibis grooves a trident in the sand,
And for the reek of carcase-garnered wool
The wattle breaks in incense o’er the land.
This morn the kookaburras’ anthem rose
Above the raucous dirge of dreary crows.
The ringbarked trees are naked sentries
grim:
No leaf, no blade, as far as eye can see,
Brown, barren plain, and dancing on the
rim
The mirage laughs in glimmering mackery,
O! fever god, bring back those blossoming
trees,
And snowy May....a1l dew....and scent
.. . .and bees!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 14, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
Even the bustle and excitement of the
Goombungee annual Show failed to lure his
Ex. from the joys of the simple life he has
been leading since my last letter. Thus the
honor of declaring the Show a going concern
was thrust upon Minister for. Rail-
ways Paget. He accomplished the busi-
ness like a craftsman. The Macgregor
has promised to emerge from social
retirement on March 24, when, with
Lady and Miss Macgregor, he will be
present at an entertainment given by “The
Dandies” in aid of the Lady Lamington Hos-
pital. The programme is to include an exhi-
bition of the drawing-room version of the
Tango, when the social fate of the dance will
be for ever decided. The fate of nations
totters in the balance.
On Tuesday the sub-regal pair will be the
guests of St. Patrick, who holds his birthday
whirroo, and his potheen and his caubeen
and his girleen, also his shillalagh, at the
Exhibition Grounds.
We’ve had two glittering visitors this
week. One arrived on Sunday, with the
name of Captain the Hon. Hutton Taylor on
his cardboard. He was formerly a com-
mander on the East India Station, and now
goes as A.D.C. to George V.’s naval repre-
sentative at the opening of the Panama
Canal, which I understand from maybe reli-
able sources, will occur on January 1, 1915.
So Commander Hutton, having rolled on
again a few hours after reaching port,
should be in good time for the blow-out. The
other notable was Premier Scott, of Sas-
katchewan, Canada —a place that is 24 syl-
lables and a sneeze. As he also moved on
across-ocean for home, almost immediately
after he arrived, I suspect him of being about
to publish a book on Queensland and its
tree-dwelling inhabitants.
Warwick was the scene of another lauda-
tory wedding last week (there has been an
epidemic of weddings in Warwick of late),
when Ethel Coe, youngest daughter of Mrs.
Charles Ilighfield, and sister of Dr. Walter
Coe, of this city, agreed to take Norton
Hickson, of Park Head, Dalby, to husband.
The risk was accepted at St. Mark’s church,
which had been artistically decorated to put
the best possible aspect on the proceedings.
The bride wore a pretty frock of ivory
mousseline de soie, festooned with Brussels
lace (her priceless veil of Limerick material
has been in the family over a hundred years).
Florence and Alice Coe attended their sister
to see the business through properly, and a
herd of friends wished the newly-weds joy and
prosperity and other things polite and appro-
priate to such an occasion. The maids were
garbed alike in lace frocks over satin, but to
save confusion, as a distinguishing mark,
Miss Florence was underneath a rose pink
hat, while sister Alice wore blue. On leaving
for the South Mrs. Hickson wore a smartly-
tailored gown of navy blue cloth, and a hat
of Tango velvet with black osprey. This is
the last time I shall mention osprey as a
portion of women’s trappings. Next time,
Thargomindali, I shall say something like
this: “Mrs. Slacksby wore a straw bucket
trimmed with the remnants of a gentle Aus-
tralian mother bird.” I don’t suppose it will
have any effect on cold-blooded fashion fol-
lowers, but I’ll try it.
A wedding of interest to Queenslanders
took place at Hampstead Parish Church
(Eng.), on January Ist, w T hen Leonie Gore,
younger daughter of the late Ralph Gore, of
Brisbane, and Mrs. Withers, was married to
Walter Bentley (not related to Walter Bent-
ley, the Dunedin, M.L., Hamlet), of Avenue-
road, Regent’s Park. The bride wore white
charmeuse enriched with seed pearl em-
broidery. Her full court train, which was of
embossed velvet, was steered by two small
nieces, Barbara and Joan Grigg, who were
dressed in quaint old-fashioned frocks, and
carried early Victorian posies. The bride’s
going-away costume was of cobalt blue char-
meuse, with black hat and coat of mole and
sliunk fur.
The engagement is announced of Dora
Schmidt, daughter of .T. C. 11. Schmidt, of
Goolburra Station, to Dudley Pike, of Glen
dilla Station, Cunnamulla, and only son o''
Mr. and Mrs. E. H. Pike, of Eagle Junction,
Brisbane. The wedding will take place at an
early date at the station home of the bride’s
parents.
Another country wedding is scheduled at
Roma on April 9th, when Myrtle Ferrier,
of that town, will be married to Lionel
Harden, of Richmond Downs.
Mrs. William Collins, of Nindooimbah
Station, Beaudesert, is on a visit to Mount
Kosciusko. She is accompanied by Mrs.
Gordon Wesche and Miss Twynam. Mrs.
Collins is a much moneyed and handsome
society widow. She was presented at Court
last winter.
Two Brisbane society girls, Nellie Page
(sister of Dr. Page) and Vivian Seymour,,
left on Sunday on an extended trip to Eng-
land and the rest of Europe. In Paris they
will join Mrs. Page and two of the Page girls:
who preceded them. After some weeks in the-
place where the fashions come from, the'
wanderers will proceed to London, where-
they will be the guests of Lady des Voeux:
(Miss Seymour’s sister) for the season.
Another Brisbane girl, Mabel Brady, one-
of our beauties, is staying at Wengen, ini
Switzerland, for the winter sports. This is-,
the first real streak of luck that Switzerland!
has had since the battle of St. Jacobs.
On Wednesday of next week the resi-
dential College for Women will be opened at
Chiselhurst, Kangaroo Point. Already the
Principal, Miss F. Bage, M.Sc., has been
installed and every room (19) in the college
taken. Although there has been no extra-
vagance, everything in the college, which is
splendidly situated, is most convenient and
up to date. Yesterday the building was
thrown open to the public for inspection, and
attracted an interested crowd of subscribers
and others.
The prevailing “baggy” fashion has arrived
here, also the new figure. This is the day of
the “Little Mary,” and the very _ newest
corsets are specially cut away to give free
play (let me whisper it) to the digestive
organs. The most up-to-date sets of lingerie
are composed of black ninon. As one fashion
journal has it, a set ought to last a season.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Governor Macgregor obligingly informed
the public, at the unveiling of J. T. Bell’s
monument at Dalby, that had that politician
not fallen ill it was his to submit
the then Speaker’s name to the King “for a
mark of royal favor.” This sort of post-
humous knighting has the double advantage-
that it may be very comforting to
relatives, and can do no harm to the de-
parted.
During the hearing of a very
divorce suit in Brisbane, an appeal was.
made in deprecation of any undue spinning
out of proceedings, inasmuch as plaintiff was;
only a tramway man getting £3 a week, and*
the fees for an extended sitting with a,
special jury were £3 a day per juror! A.
man could buy a whole tramcar with the-
price of a week’s divorce.
“Rangan”: The big sugar growers of'
Queensland —who have formed themselves
into a Producers’ Ass. Ltd. —recently called!
on Acting-Premier Barnes. After many
mutual kind words they got to their say..
They were strenuous supporters of a white-
Australia. The sugar industry could and;
should be carried on by white labor only..
Barnes looked puzzled. This was new. He-
couldn’t catch the idea. They wished toi
suggest that Barnes was a little too free im
the matter of alien exemptions. In fact,
last year no alien application had been re-
fused. At present there were a large number
of black growers of sugar. They didn’t think
it was right. Barnes looked worried and
haggard. Then it was incidentally remarked
that there was a likelihood of the sugar tariff
being revised by the Commonwealth, and
nasty hints had got about that the black
labor was likely to cause a reduction of the
£6 impost duty. Then Barnes ceased to
totter on his basis. He saw the point, and
promised that the end of next year would
see the expiration of the alien exemption
clause, and sugar would then be as white as
possible.

NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD TABLETS
Are the scientific result of the research work of the
world’s greatest authorities and specialists. They
build up the nervous system by a process of natural
nutrition, and the benefit gained is lasting and perma-
nent. Antineurasthin as a NERVE FOOD gives
wonderful results in physical and mental overstrain
and exhaustion, and on account of its beneficial effect
upon THE BLOOD is invaluable in cases of Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc. Antineurasthin shows remarkable
effect upon THE PROCESS OF NUTRITION,
and marked and immediate benefit in complaints
arising from weak digestion, dyspepsia, and mal-
nutrition. Antineurasthin expedites growth, en-
riches the blood (by an increase of red corpuscles)
and restores it to a healthy condition. It increases
mental activity and generally strengthens the nervous
system as well as the physique. Its administration
produces wonderful results in weak children as well
as in those affected with Rickets.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
Thirty years of assiduous study of The Hair and its Treatment, and all
Capillary Diseases as they affect the Scalp and Hair, have given me the means
of Preserving the Hair, and producing a new growth, after all other preparations
have failed.
Mr. Fred Peakman, of Wairoa, New Zealand, is another wonderful case. His hairdresser tells me
he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations, he has
got a splendid growth of hair.
Mr. O’Rourke, Wee Waa, New South Wales, writes: “My head, which was nearly bald, has now
come back to its usual growth.”
Mr. Sutherland states: “I had only a little down on my head when I commenced to use your
SPECIAL PARASENE and COSMO LOTION ; now I have a beautiful head of hair.”
Gentlemen who are going bald should use Special Parasene find CosillO Lotion, one at
night and the other in the morning, and wash the head once a week with Shainpuna.
Price (with postage, two months’ treatment): Victoria, 12/-; four months, 22/6. Other
States, 12/6 and 23/6.
Ladies with hair falling out should apply Restorer at night, and Cosmo Lotion in the
morning, and wash the head as often as necessary with Shampuna.
Naturaline is a splendid preparation for coloring Grey Hair. It acts quickly, naturally
and effectively, and is perfectly harmless. Made in all colors. Get the right strength.

P. Pickle: You miss the point. The fact
that husbands lose money at “two-up,” and that,
in consequence, their wives and families suffer,
doesn’t mean that the game is unfair. It indicates
merely that those particular husbands are unlucky.
The Judge was right. Two-up is one of the fairest
games of chance in existence —ten times as fair as
stock-gambling and about 40 times more so than the
sport of kings G.H. (St. George): Bulletins of
eight or nine years ago are of no value to us. . . .
M.A.T. (Vic.): Particulars too meagre... .M.E.G..
On the weak side.... Matey: Ah! But the copy s
pulp by this time. Better write the par. again. .. .
E.A.T.: You might sell it somewhere else. Have
returned manuscript.... Anti-Poverty: If you mean
that Australia should adopt Freetrade, we
decline to argue with you. In this paper’s opinion,
the fact indicates that you are an ass, a galoot, a
moon-calf, a loon, or any other thing that is futile
and uninformed Exile: Yarn re rabbit-shooting
in England isn’t fantastic enough to be a good Abo.
lie. It is just a drab, ordinary lie, and few things
are drabber.... Palo: It is always worth while to
take a technical point when the case is going against
you. We don’t think much of your point, but you
never know what the law may do. For instance, a
one-legged man named Smith would probably get his
conviction quashed on the ground that the charge
should have been laid against part of a man named
Smith. ... H. Richards: Don’t know when your rela-
tives left off using the name Lapmotiere. It is this
sort of query that brings home to us the sickening
numerosity of the things which we don’t know. We
can’t even tell which lion ate most Christians in the
Gplisaium. . . .M.K.: Your handwriting is beautiful
and your grammar unimpeachable, but you lack the
light touch... .Steve: Do you mean to say that,
with all your travelling, you have just heard that
story? Go to Z.Y.X.. For the 150th and last
time—Ned Kelly was hanged in Melbourne Gaol on
November 11, 1880. If this date is wrong we can’t
help it... .F.M.C.: That old story hardly calls for
repetition. The person chiefly concerned wasn’t a
very attractive character anyhow, and his doings
were unpleasant... .J. Mclntosh: Sorry we can’t
publish your letter owing to its utter lack of detail
and interest. Probably that was why the Worker
turned it down.... Pelican: Your grievance is bogus.
Both advts. were drawn by Australians. The train-
motor-car one is by J. H. Chinner, of S.A., the
shooting-party picture by Harry Weston, for Jones
and Jardine, of Sydney. Why, by the way, aren’t
you game to supply your name and address? Are
you in an asylum or what?... .Yost: Webster’s dic-
tionary supplied an adequate definition of a Wowser
years ago. .. .Waverley Penn: You had better give
up contributing. You send a list of March birth-
days (rather late to be of interest), and among them
you include “N.S.W. Government Astronomer H. C.
Russell, 78 on the 17th.” Can’t remember how
many years it is since that gentleman retired or
how long it is since he died—but you had better
give up contributing. We have got the measure of
your unreliability.... Jonquil: Your arguments in
favor of peace and non-resistance duly to hand. By
the way, did you notice that it was a Quaker girl
who furiously assaulted a London policeman after
Mrs. Pankhurst’s latest arrest ? Incidentally, and
to go further back, a rousing Yankee war song of
the Civil War days with the refrain “We are Coming,
Father Abraham, Three Hundred Thousand Strong,”
was written by a Quaker. When a wholly un-
trained. member of the Society of Friends gets roused
to battle he |>angs ,things, about a lot in his undis-
ciplined way'. .. . W.H.A. (Barraba, N.S.W.) : In
answer to your query—Yes. .. .Edward H.: A broken
neck is not a likely theme. You can’t crack a
joke about it. . . .G.J.G.: Dry rhyme. . . .F.C.H.: “The
accompanying lines” will not be inserted in this
journal, which isn’t valuable, but tries to be worth
sixpence. .. .R.S.: As flicks they are not bad, but
we don’t care for flicks. .. .G.G. (M.L.) : Plenty of
vigor, but your punches don’t land often. .. .A.W.S.
(Perth): A long rhyme and a heavy one....Xeno:
“How moves the world ?” Don’t know, but the
bard moves off our doorstep. .. .Leon (V.): Blow
“the gentle swish of busy swallows sampling Nature’s
store.”. .. .D.L.D.: Idea is old now and your verses
are not worth a cuss. . . .Fi Arm: Sorrowful item. .. .
C.A.: “Tucker” doesn’t rhyme with “gutter,” and
“bands” won’t match “land.” Relinquish the hopeless
struggle to write verse... .Penwill: Drop 0ut....
A.Y.Z.: Not even here. . . .Jim B.: Artemus Ward
preceded you. And why should the versified sun-
downer be worried because “no woman weeps for
him.” Who wants to have a woman weeping for
him ?. . . .T.H.P.: Sorry no use for yarn. Panama-
Pacific News Co., Market-street, San Francisco. .. .
A.A.A. (Sydney): Unsuitable. .. .H.H.W.: Sincere
work but hardly enough force or finish. .. .A.W.S.:
Yes, and it needeth ever the utmost skill to con-
quer the seething manuscript overboard. .. .T.I.K.
(S.^O: Tame sort of yarn tamely t01d....
Reedbed. We will retaliate in your own tremendous
style: “Go and wander where you will, but never
darken our basket again.”.... Brother B.: You can
go into mourning for your poem. .. . Belasco N.: No
go. .. . J.D.W. (S.A.) : No bite in it.... Mick M.:
Another writer has worked the Ship of State. Don’t
sail in his wake and invite the comparison that
would be horrible for y0u.... Hugh S.: Topics die
young. The grass is green on the one you have
chosen. ... Emmie G.: Too late. .. .R.S.L.: Forced
humor.... Homo : Consider yourself cursed. Now, if
you have any human feeling at all, you will throw
yourself down on the mat and expire. .. .S.A.K.: Too
tender for print.... Agnes G.: Why should we be
merciful to a beginner if that beginner has caused
us great agony?... .W.L. (N.S.W.): Staggering
verse.... Bert G. F.: Another feeding-bottle author!
Well, you can’t wheel yourself round in your peram-
bulator here. . . .M.X.G.: If only it had been a little
better—or a little worse. ... Scratch Mark: Yes, you
may improve in time. If not, you will certainly
improve in Eternity.... Mark L.: There is a glim-
mer of promise in your work. (P.S. —The glimmer
is like the dancing glim of a candle seen at the
other end of a long tunnel; but it may be a bushfire
of fulfilment later on.) ... .C.J.C.: Of course, Mrs.
Hamfat let her husband in badly when she cut a
piece out 'of the centre of the measuring tape that
he used when he paid the men for clearing done by
the acre. But she had a wild idea that she was
swindling the men—not defrauding husband Hamfat.
Surely it wasn’t necessary to expound the point at
length. Something should be left to the reader’s
imagination or comprehension. A Soul grasps the
thing that is half-expressed. A Beadle wants it ex-
plained to the bitter end, with footnotes and mar-
ginal notes and an appendix. Sometimes he also
wants a dictionary and a balloon. Don’t be a Beadle.
Be a Soul. ...Shearer: The Bulletin did not express
those opinions about Tyson. They appeared in the
paper on January 22 last, and were plainly, legibly
and indelibly signed by a contributor. The fact
that they were accredited to The Bulletin as The
Bulletin by the Waterside Workers’ Gazette
doesn’t make much difference. It really makes no
difference, or even less.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Miss B.: The background is the best part of it....
J.G.: Stone Age drawing and joke....R.G. (South
Coast). Awful production. .. .W.G. (Tas.): Once
more the old gags and the scratchy drawing....
H.H.M.: Scratchy, muddy and distorted visions;
also, one gag is older than the Pyramids... .R.E.:
The jest isn’t discernible and the diagram doesn’t
matter L.W.: Give it up. You haven’t much to
give; but give it up.... I. Pim: Wretched sour little
figures. They would take the joy out of the most
sparkling retort.... Elway: There is no escape from
horrible art, and yours is very horrible. .. .S.T.:

These are “the big three” in the gramophone sales list.
They are, perhaps, the most widely popular of the many “His Master’s Voice”
instruments. The prices are within easy reach of most people, and the
instruments are superb in tone, mechanism and cabinet work.
Go to the nearest accredited “H.M.V.” dealer and ask him to show you these
instruments. If you do not know where to find him, write to us and we will
give you his name and address, and send also the complete instrument cata-

which would take four or five men hours of tedious work, and,
what is more important, the work done by the Comptometer
will be absolutely correct.
The Comptometer is to-day to the bookkeeper what the

to be without one if any figuring has to be done.
Adds —Multiplies—Subtracts—Divides

The superior speed and accuracy of the Comptometer in
adding is proved by its general use throughout the great
stores of the world. For adding sales checks 20,000 to 50,000 can be totalled
and. proved daily in half the time possible by any other means.

The Comptometer is the only machine
equipped with subtraction

use to-day on multiplication as all other makes of
adding machines put together.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/-. . Mention of Thb
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from J. P. Talty, 38S Sussex Street, Sydney.

Hair Fell Out, Itched Something
Terrible, Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment, No Trouble Since.
Sutton Forest, N. S. W.—“ About five
years ago my hair began to fall out and my
scalp was covered with dandruff. If I
scratched it you would see little bits of
dandruff fly out of it. The itching was
something terrible and I was always
scratch!.lg and would lay awake for hours
at night. I tried a lot of different so-called
remedies, but without success. At last a
friend (who had had the same thing and
had been cured by the Cuticura Remedies)
advised me to Use Cuticura Ointment,
which I did along with the Cuticura Soap,
and in a week there was a decided improve-
ment and in less than six weeks my head
was freer from irritation and dandruff than
it had ever been before and was covered
with long glossy hair. I used the Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment as directed
and have had no trouble since. If I had
only known about the Cuticura Remedies
before, it would have saved me a lot of
needless suffering.” (Signed) George An-
drews, October, 1912.
For pimples and blackheads the following
is a most effective and economical treat-
ment: Gently smear the affected parts with
Cuticura Ointment, on the end of the finger,
but do not rub. Wash off the Cuticura
Ointment in five minutes with Cuticura
Soap and hot water and continue bathing
for some minutes. This treatment is best
on rising and retiring. At other times use
Cuticura Soap freely for the toilet and bath,
to assist in preventing inflammation, irri-
tation and clogging of the pores. Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment are sold
throughout the world. Liberal sample of
each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

“Rob”: There have been 17 different kinds of rows
in a dozen Maoriland newspaper offices, and now the
haughty directors of the Maoriland Press Association
are prostrating themselves in the humblest way they
know of before the shipping firm of Burns, Philp
and 00. It all came about through a frisky cable-
man somewhere. The cable-man was transmitting a
Washington speech, in which an earnest Congress-
man, desiring to lay emphasis upon the unpleasant-
ness of Japanese immigration, said there were two
million immoral women in Japan. The frisky cable-
man, seized of the possibilities of the situation,
interpolated, on his own account: “Burns, Philp
arranging cheap excursions to Japan.” The solemn
Caledonian who received the message simply shook
his head at the thought of such awfu’ depravity, and
passed it on. The incredible cable subs, to whose
hands it came, smelt no rodent, and “sent it up,”
and it appeared in nearly all the Maoriland morning
newspapers. The estimable gentleman who manages
the Maoriland Press Association had a fit over his
bacon that morning, and for the rest of the day he
made the wires hot, and the libel was overtaken
and beheaded. But Burns, Philp and Co. had some-
thing to say, and the newspapers of February 26
contained some fine examples of longwinded apologies.
* * * *
M. L. Reading, who takes the editorial chair of
the Lyttelton Times (Christchurch, M.L.), in suc-
cession of Sam Saunders (one of Maoriland’s few
“big” editors), is a young man who has, as it were,
aeroplaned in the inky business. Like many good
pressmen he was a compositor in the days when the
world was young. Less than 12 years ago he attached
himself to the Wellington (M.L.) Times, under Fred
Kirby, who has trained a long string of smart men
(incidentally, Kirby joins Sydney Telegraph, which
seems to get most of its new men from Maoriland).
From assistant sub-editor on the Times, Reading
climbed steadily until he was, in fact if not in
name, editor of the paper. When Saunders retired
from the Lyttelton Times, leaving that paper much
the poorer for his departure, the Board breathed persua-
sively into the ear of the young writer on the Wellington
Times and said something of a honeyed nature about
salary. So, as the novelists say, a dark figure, pro-
bably carrying an umbrella, but otherwise showing
no signs of a desire to conceal its past, might have
been seen one day boarding the Lyttelton steamer.
It was Reading on his way to his new billet.
* * * *
C. P. Little, just dead under an appendicitis opera-
tion in London, was a journalist of the type Aus-
tralia doesn’t breed. The man who “will never go any-
where except as a guest,” and is “a supreme author-
ity on all questions of dress”—Little’s admitted
claims and qualities—is apt to be proprietor here, or
at least editor. He, however, was quite content to
be known as Society Reporter, and he society-
reported with the assured touch of one who knew
his job. He was present at all swagger entertain-
ments, and frequently lent an experienced hand in
getting them up. King Edward appreciated him
highly, and used to give instructions that the Mail
man should have special personal privileges when
royalty was about.
* * * *
“P.K.”: Sydney’s coming Labor daily has two
London examples to study—the Herald and the
Citizen, both infants. The Herald, which got a
few months start of the Citizen, tried to dispense
with a modern news service, with the result that
it is now little more than a pamphlet. The Citizen,
which started on a capital of under £lOO,OOO, had
a circulation of over 220,000 before it was three
months old, and would have had more had not the
directors decided to leave out racing news and tips.
Frank Dilnot is in charge, and has got together a
respectable staff, at least equal to that of any other
big daily. Its bosses, though they made one mistake,
at least didn’t risk the infant’s life by feeding it
entirely on union matters. But England is a long
way behind Germany in regard to Labor papers.
Every big German trades union has its weekly, the
total circulation being about 3,000,000 copies; while
the Socialist dailies have a circulation of over
1,500,000.
THOU SHALT NOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No wonder that the heathen rage and leap upon their
hats,
And prance like mad upon their heels and foam like
brewers’ vats,
Considering the rules and laws and barriers and
things—
The hundred thousand obstacles and chafing leading
strings
That human nature’s saddled with. God knows how
long ago
This endless craze to cramp desires was started here
below;
But, this is sure as debt and time and wind beyond
a hill,
The crampers haven’t ceased to cramp; they keep
on cramping still.
Wherever harried nature turns, hot, maddened
prophets shout:
“Get off the grass!” or “Woe and death!” Or else
“Look out for gout!”
Or some such warning to the flesh that aims to move
along
In peaceful contemplation of the gay and festive
throng.
They chase you from the cheery wine (all wine is
devil’s brew),
And from the girl (a tempter since that day when
Adam threw
A handspring out of Eden and took land up on his
ear).
They bellow forth, “All flesh is grass!” and that the
sinner’s tear
Is all that comes to him who seeks to prove it
cakes and ale
Or kisses. Nay, this life on earth is pain and much
travail —
Seek solace on the ashes in the cellar with the dog,
Be penitent and lowly-like, content to tend the hog.
Ambition makes for riches, yea, and riches ruin all;
Men hasten from their sanctity and in the pot-house
brawl.
Lo, in the dance they caper high, and at the race-
course they
Are godless ones who back the horse that loiters on
its way.
Some seek the noisome playhouse, where the bare-
backed women sit.
And laugh aloud and smack their knees at some poor
worldling’s wit,
Instead of, on their bones at homes within the coal
resort,
Preparing for the Better Land and singing “Hold
the Fort.”
Some dice for drink with publicans, some surf with
supple girls,
What time their souls are being lost in life’s in-
fevered swirls.
Some wreck the peace of God His day by sailing on
His sea,
Or laving in His cool lagoons, or drinking billy tea
Beneath the green palms that His hand has fashioned
for our joy—
All these are evils in His sight, they shock Him and
annoy.
“Thou shalt not,” is the message that the Holy Fools
display.
I wonder, if the Lord could hear, exactly what He’d
say?

DIGEST WHAT
YOU EAT.
K?
Do you enjoy what you eat? If you don’t, your food does not do you much good.
There is no way to maintain the health and strength of mind and body except by
nourishment. There is no way to nourish the body except through the stomach.
The stomach must be kept healthy, pure and sweet, or the strength will go down
and disease will result. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are the remedy that
everyone should take when there is anything wrong with the stomach.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are the only digestant or combinations of
digestants that will digest ALL classes of food. When you take Dr. Sheldon’s
Digestive Tabules everything you eat tastes good, and every bit of the nutriment
that it contains is assimilated and appropriated by the blood and tissues. Did you
ever hear of a man or woman being sick or weak who could eat heartily, and who
enjoyed their meals? Every man, woman, or child who is sick, puny, or weak, can
soon eat heartily and enjoy every meal if they use Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules.
Make Your Stomach Strong 8 Healthy
These TABULES are sold everywhere at 1/6 for a tin containing 36 TABULES, or 2/& for ai tin
containing 80 TABULES. Buy a tin, eat a good, square meal, and then take the TABULEo
according to directions, and note the result. You will forget all about it if you are not careful,
for there will be NO PAIN or disturbance, and the food will be DIGESTED just as it used to
be when your STOMACH was WELL and STRONG. Furthermore, your stomach will soon be
restored again if you keep on taking them, just as thousands upon thousands of other stomachs
have been by the sole and exclusive use of DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES.

Kephaldol, the new-found remedy for pain,
is the product of one of the Continent’s most
famous specialists.
Kephaldol is sure, quick-acting, and kills
pain without the risk of any harm to those
who use it. Unlike other remedies used for
Headache, Neubalgia, Neubitis, etc.,
Kephaldol does not affect or depress the
heart action. It is safe to use in large
or small doses. Doctors by the hundreds
have reported it to be unequalled for the
above troubles, as well as for Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Painful Menstruation and nerve
pains generally.
It is guaranteed under the Pure Food Act
1908 of N.S.W., and no other painkiller has
the endorsement of the medical profession
enjoyed by Kephaldol.

AZA?
What the British
Doctors have said:
“ I find Kephaldol a very useful
product. It acts well In my case
as an antineuralgic and antihid-
rotic.”
—Dr. J. Prentice, Birkenhead.
“ In one case of Neuralgia the
relief from pain was very rapid,
and the patient was highly pleased
with the treatment.”
—Dr. S. P. Hyam, Edinburgh.
“ Having used Kephaldol in
several cases of painful menstru-
ation, I am able to say that It
proves of service. In one case it
acted almost magically, as also in
one of Facial Neuralgia, where the
usual treatment had failed.”
—Dr. W. Look, Hull.

It seemed a very proper thing to spoon
When night and conversation grew a bore,
And as her pretty lips were most inciting
I kissed her to find some excuse for writing.
Damsels have various purposes on earth,
And one not all unknown to striving men
Is to supply in reason’s utter dearth
Material for a blunt, poetic pen ;
And, as I said, this lady was most useful
In finding rhyming copy by the Museful. •
Her lips, as I remarked, were red and sweet,
Her hair was black, with just a touch of
blue;
I reconstructed both her tiny feet
From one small portion of a shiny shoe;
Her waist was just about the dainty
measure
Of nothing multiplied by night and pleasure.
Her eyes were bright as inkwells in the sun,
And much the color of some new-made tar;
The corners of her mouth were curved for
fun;
Her nose was tilted like a pale, proud
star;
Her voice was like a wren’s, but somewhat
louder,
And all her make-up was a little powder.
Now no one seeing us would lightly dream
What tragic matters cunning fate had hid
Between that quiet moon’s untroubled beam
And the brown velvet of her eyes’ soft lid.
In fact, a long, good-night I might have bid
lier,
If I had stopped (sans grammar) to con-
sider.
I did not hurry matters up at all;
Of that one sin at least my soul is clear.
But, oh, her little fingers were so small
And both her pretty ears were pinkly dear.
If I had been the least bit apprehensive
I might have even thought these charms ex-
pensive.
To play with fire is dangerous at best,
And danger lurked in her sweet face and
form ;
It was as if a mocking god had drest
In some sheep’s clothing a large thunder-
storm,
And while the bolts of death within were
heating
Deceived all nature with a simple bleating.
Until the moment that the lightning sprang
Full-furnaced to her terrible dark eyes
It seemed our pleasant hearts together sang
And took top notes in somewhat frequent
sighs.
It did not seem as if our kisses mattered
Till that explosion all my quiet shattered.
The frightful things that I that night en-
dured
Still send a cold, bleak shudder down my
spine,
Naught worse could happen to the sad wight
lured
To terrible resorts of doctored wine.
I paid a price for dalliance and laughter
Like that the damned are feigned to pay
hereafter.
Exactly what occurred I must not tell
Because the time is hardly ripe as yet.
The moon and kitten cloudlets heard my yell,
My brow with sweat of agony was wet;
So just you wait until you really get a
Full statement in my epic “Henrietta.”

PAT O'MAORI.
My Advance Agent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was years and years ago, in the fine
days when everybody was young. One
could do almost anything then, and it
was looked upon as a joke. No doubt there
were serious business people at that time,
as there are now, but I had little to do with
them. I did most truly believe that the
things that, by harsh compulsion of circum-
stance, I have since been forced to regard
as the stern facts of existence were merry
jests in solemn disguise—dismal-looking, but
really light-hearted masquers in the joyous
Carnival of Life. It was an exhilarating
creed, though perhaps not one that would
have been approved of by strict moralists.
There were, however, no strict moralists in
that happy time, or, if there were any, I did
not meet them. The people I knew were
mostly persons who wanted to drink or go
fishing. Of course they did some sort of work
for a living, but I never saw them at it. I
also did some writing for the papers, now
and then, but not enough to seriously affect
their circulation or mine.
* * * *
In the midst of this gay, irresponsible
existence I received a sudden shock that —
like the stroke of sickness which made the
devil-may-care young soldier Loyola become
the founder of Jesuitism —caused me to take
a new view of my reason of being in the
world. To put it briefly, I became a Capi-
talist. The transition was as rapid as it
was unexpected. In the morning I was skil-
fully operating upon the cashier of this paper
—which was also young then, by the way—
for half-crowns in advance; in the evening
I was the proud possessor of a bank draft for
£3O, which came by post. The banks being
closed for the day I had to wait until next
morning to cash it. I had two or three of
the half-crowns left, however, and managed,
with the assistance of some friends, to get
through the heavy hours until it was time to
go to bed. I said nothing, as far as I was
aware, to any of my friends about my pro-
motion to the Plutocracy. I simply remarked
in a casual way that I had had a little stroke
of luck, and asked the waiter to set them
up again. The potentiality of wealth in my
pocket sobered me in a most astonishing
fashion. I went to bed that night too fuil
of thought to have room for much whisky.
* * * * *
I awoke in the morning to find Spruhan
pacing up and down the room like a pan-
ther, with a pipe in his mouth, walking to
and fro in a cage. It was one of Spruhan’s
many peculiarities that he could not com-
fortably rest in one place for two minutes
at a time. He saw that I was awake and
said: “I hope I didn’t disturb' you. I sat
down as long as I could. Then I had to
get up and walk about. But I tried to walk
quietly.”
I assured him that he had not disturbed
me in the least. He then seated himself on
the edge of the bed, and, fixing me with
his straight eye—for he had a crooked one
that roved all over the room —said in a low,
earnest voice, like the voice of conscience:
“What do you mean to do with all that
money ?”
“All what money?”
He seemed hurt for a moment, as if I had
withdrawn my confidence from him without
reason. Then he appeared to form another
theory to account for my behavior, and, ris-
ing up, put his slouch hat upon his head and
walked quickly out of the room. “Back in
five minutes,” he said, as he passed through
the door.
In less than the time mentioned I heard
his short, nervous steps on the landing. He
came in with a large glass in one hand, and
a bottle of soda in the other. He laid these
down on the dressing-table and produced a
flask of brandy from his pocket. “I’m going
to make you a stiff brandy-and-soda,” he ob-
served. I made no objection, and he per-
formed the operation with perfect gravity.
After I had swallowed the mixture he asked
me, with a twinkle in his normal eye, if I
felt better? I said that I did, chiefly to
humor him. Meanwhile I had ransacked
my memory to find out whether I had inad-
vertently—the least hint would have been
enough for him —let him know that I had
received money. I came to the conclusion
that I must have done so, and waited for
what would follow.
“Of course you remember, now?” he re-
marked. I nodded.
His face brightened immediately. “That’s
all right,” he exclaimed cheerfully. “I
know how a man wakes in the morning,
though you didn’t seem to have taken any-
thing to speak of last night.”
* * * #
He asked me if I would have another, and,
when I shook my head, mixed one for him-
self, drank it quickly, and spoke as follows,:
“I came here early, because I thought some
of the other fellows might have heard what
you told me in confidence. (I kicked myself
softly under the bedclothes.) I don’t think
they did, but there is nothing like being sure.
They are all of them as good as gold, but
they have no ideas of business. They think
that money—their money, your money, my
money, anybody’s money—is only made to be
spent. That might be all very well if you
had only a pound or two, or even a fiver.
In that case I myself might advise you to
have a flutter with it, while it lasted. But
when# it comes to an amount like thirty
pounds the case is entirely different. You
can do something better with thirty pounds
than chuck it away on draw-poker and
liquor. I take that for granted. The ques-
tion that then remains is: What is the
something better that you can do with the
coin? If it were mine I would know what
to do with it this morning.”
“What would that be?” I inquired.
“Never mind,” he replied with a wink.
“Start a chicken farm, or a chicken-hazard
school, perhaps. As, however, the money
isn’t mine, it remains to be seen how you
can use it to best advantage. You know
nothing of racing matters, or I might have
advised you to make a little book on the
coming races.” He paused in his speech and
looked at me wistfully for a moment. I
shook my head and laughed.
*** . *
“I thought not,” he said. “Well, it can’t
be helped. I have another idea, and prob-
ably a better one. Why not write a rattling
good lecture? —you can do it if you try.
There is money in the idea. Look at
Charles Clarke! Of course you could not
expect to make as much as he does at first
go-off, but you would soon gain confidence,
and that’s the main thing in lecturing, as it
is in everything else.”
“But I never made an original speech in
public in my life.”
He waved the objection away with the
stem of his pipe.
“That’s of no consequence,” he said.
“Everybody must make a start at some time
or other.”
“Then I don’t know what to lecture about.”
“That also matters little. I know some-
thing about audiences. They don’t care if
your subject is Fried Fish, as long as you
interest them. Why not lecture on Austra-
lian Literature?”
I replied that the subject did not seem to
me to be one of a particularly rousing
nature.
“Not as you look at it, perhaps,” he re-
sponded. “ You would probably tell them
what a fine thing it was to have a Native
Literature, and how every nation worth its
salt ought to be able to supply its own
authors and poets, and not let them starve
more than necessary. Then you would
quote pieces from Kendall and Gordon and
Marcus Clarke, and say what fine geniuses
they were, and what a shame it was that
Australia allowed them to die so early. I
know the patter; I’ve heard it before. A
little of it is all right, and proper to the
occasion. But the public won’t stand much
of it. The public wants to be amused, not
to be made melancholy. What you have to
do is to give your audiences character
sketches of these authors. Tell them, for
instance, all about Gordon’s steeplechasing,
and how he used to spend his time when he
wasn’t steeplechasing or writing poetry. You
might also mention his favorite brand of
liquor, and how many drinks a day he used
t'' take on an average.”
“But I know nothing about that.”
“Never mind,” Spruhan exclaimed im-
patiently; “who is there to contradict you?
Besides, these little details will not hurt
anybody, and will give pleasure to a number
of people. Your main concern is to make
your lecture picturesque and interesting.
You might, for instance, give a description
of a night in Melbourne, with Marcus
Clarke in the chair, and Walstab and Bun-
ster, and all the old Bohemian crowd in
the room smoking and cracking jokes and
drinking and telling yarns. Then recite
“Bill Jinks,” as Marcus' Clarke used
to give it. Also tell your audiences one
or two stories about Clarke’s adventures
with bailiffs. That’s what will fetch them.
A casual allusion to “His Natural Life”
will be sufficient. Always bear in mind that
it isn’t the writers’ works, but the writers
your audiences want to hear about. They
can read the works for themselves if they

KEEP YOUR KIDNEYS WELL, AND
THEY WILL KEEP YOU WELL”
There is not a drop of pure blood in the body until
it has passed through the kidneys.
For the kidneys are the blood-filters. From birth
to death the blood is constantly flowing through them
to be filtered. The heart pumps the blood, but the
KIDNEYS purify it. They strain out the uric acid
poison and waste water, and dispose of it through the
urinary system.
Every twenty-four hours the kidneys remove about
500 grains of urinous poison and three pints of
water from the blood. But when they are weakened
by a cold, overwork or excess of any kind they begin
to lose their power of separating the urine from the
blood.
Then the poisonous waste they leave in the blood
begins to make you feel heavy, dull and drowsy; you
suffer from headache, sick headache, dizziness or
rheumatic twinges. The water left in the system
collects under the skin and causes the swellings of
dropsy. There are urinary disorders and gravel.

ing, tonic, and strengthening effect upon weak
kidneys, gently leading them back to health and

Backache & Kidney
Trouble.
2 LASTING CURES.
2 YEARS CURED..
(i Mrs. W. P. Ritzau, 11 Myrtle Street, North Sydney, says:
“For years I have been a great sufferer from kidney disease.
I have been treated by doctors and in hospitals, and have
been_ tortured by operations. After 15 months in one
hospital I came out a thorough cripple. I was so ill I
was advised to go back into the hospital, but my husband
would not let me go. I was recommended by a friend to
use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and commenced using
them, carefully following the directions. These pills have
cured me. I can now get about and do my work, and the
pain has completely left me. My cure is wonderful, for
mine was really a very bad case. Since my cure my uncle
has used the remedy, and they have effected a complete cure
in his case also. Our two cures prove that Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are a positive cure for kidney trouble.”
Two years later Mrs. Ritzau says: “I am pleased to say
that I have been free of kiduey troubles since Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured me over two years ago.”
5 YEARS CURED.
Mrs. Horwitz, 75 Pitt Street Redfern, Sydney, says:
“My husband suffered with severe aching pains across the
small of his back, and his general health was bad. The
backache prevented him from getting about, and his rest at
night was broken. He could not get to sleep on account
of the constant ache, while to stoop was agony. He was
very bad, and seemed to be getting worse every day. Having
great faith in Doan’s Remedies, I sent for a bottle _of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills ; a few doses gave him relief,
and he went on taking them. After finishing the fourth
bottle the backache had quite left him. He also used Doan s
Dinner Pills with the Kidney Pills, and they proved excellent
for constipation.”
Mrs. Horwitz says, five years later: “My husband is
never troubled with backache now, his cure is permanent.
I need not enlarge on this, the facts speak for themselves.

wanj: to. }f they don t, they will not appre-
mate you? attempts at spoon-feeding. If
it wej*e possible it would be a good idea to
have thrown upon a screen limelight por-
traits, of your authors in the act of writing,
or drinking, or in any other characteristic
attitude. This would make your lectures
life-like and doubly interesting. When you
came to deal with Kendall you might tell
some, of his experiences when he was forest
ranging on the Hawkesbury—how he met
Perry, the Champion Porridge-Eater, for
instance, and how the people who kept the
Accommodation House at Berowra, or some-
where, put Perry in the place of honor at
the table, and Kendall at the bottom of the
groaning board. This would give you a
chance to be ironical, and make some bitter
remarks about literary taste in the rural
districts. Same with the other authors you
introduced in your lecture. Don’t pay so.
much attention to wliat they wrote as to how
they wrote it. The popular opinion is that
all authors—poets in particular—write under
the inspiration of liquor, and that the more
liquor they have in them—up to a certain
point—the better they write. It will be
waste of time if you try to uproot this
settled conviction. Besides, even if you
succeeded in the attempt, it would be bad
policy. People would hate to have to be-
lieve that a poet does his work in a common-
place, sober way like any other tradesman.
If that belief became general there would be
a bad time in store for the poets. They
would be treated just as if they were ordi-
nary citizens, and would be expected to con-
form to the laws of commercial morality.
No young man of genius would want to be
a poet if that happened, and only persons
with money—retired grocers, and militia
colonels, and aldermen with spare time on
their hands—could afford to write poetry.
This, I imagine, would hardly be a good
thing for Australian Literature. Then,
again, there are lots of people who believe
that if they were to give themselves up to
drink, and neglect their business, and let
their hair grow long, they could write as
good poetry as any professional bard in the

disclosure. The public are like, children

see the inside works, and to know what
makes the thing go.
Spruhan was pacing. nervously up and
down the room all the time he was talking,
“You seem to know so much about the sub-
ject—why not deliver the lecture yourself?”
I said.
“So I would,” he replied, “so I would—if
I could write. But my name has never
appeared in print over anything in the
shape of verse or prose. And the public
won’t allow you to talk about Literature
unless you are a Literary Person yourself,
You may lecture on Art without being an
Artist, Music without being a Musician,
Finance without being a Financier, Politics
without being a Politician: but you must
not presume to speak with authority upon
Literature unless you are a Literary Per-
son. So it comes to this, that as your

stamping his foot with annoyance. “If you

proposition—as I then looked at it, in the
days of wine and roses—captivated me.

“Then get up, and dress, and begin,” he
remarked.

lished himself as my Advance Agent. And

JJat day The task was not so areaf as it
would "have been in W these**
times. There was then no galloping Pat-
erson or Oilvie no sea-chanlv-sinaina
Brady, no mournful Boake, or deep, in-
scrutable Brennan, no tender and shadowy
Quinn . Farrell had just risen above the
horizon. I had therefore to deal with only
fbe Old Masters of Australian Literature,
Next day Spruhan called upon me. He was
wearing a new tie, but was in other re-
spects dressed in his ugual negligent, not
sa y SO mewhat shabby, style. “I think
we had better open at Newcastle, and then
g 0 up through New England towards Bris-
bane,” he said . “ Whe n do vou think you
w :i] have the lecture finished*?”
j to ld him that I thought I could mauage
to get it done in about two davs more.
“Very well. I’ll start for Newcastle this
evening and fix up the local papers and
arrange for the hall and bill the place.”
I said that I was agreeable, and gave him
the £lO which, he thought, would amply
cover his expenses till the returns from the
lecture commenced to roll in.
We had a parting drink, and I went to
work again.
On Saturday night I took the boat for
Newcastle. All that day I had been feeling
curiously ill. I did not know, until I re-
turned to Sydney, what was the matter
with me. It was what they call, in these
days of new names, Influenza. A nice be-
ginning for a lecturing tour! As I went
aboard the boat, paying little attention to
anything or anybody, I noticed, with a dull,
uninquisitive eye, something strangely,
grotesquely familiar —as one might appear
to recognise, when awake, a phantom seen
in a nightmare—about a furtive slouch-
hatted figure that lurched unsteadily up the
gangwmy and dived into the forward part of
the vessel.
■** •**
The passage was a rough one, and when
we arrived on Sunday morning, and I went
to my hotel, I was glad to go to bed. About
an hour or so afterwards my Advance
Agent came to see me.
He had a black eye—luckily the oblique
eye—but beamed with the other.
“I’ve fixed up everything splendidly,” he
said. “Billed the whole place. Advertised in
all the papers. Taken a hall. Yes. Every-
thing’s splendid and orright. But Pm not
quite orright. Sometimes it’s the duty of a
good advance agent not to be orright. But
I’ve got a big man to see —and I want two
pounds. Yes.”
I gave the money to him. What else could
I do? I was in his hands. But I asked
him to bring me up some whisky. This was
at about 11 in the morning. Twelve. One.
Two. Three.
No Spruhan.
The influenza, or whatever it might have
been, was getting a firmer grip upon me.
What the devil would I do? By a dead-lift-
effort I got out of bed, dressed myself, and
put on a long, grey overcoat which I had
brought with me to use in travelling over
New England and Southern Queens’and —
the nights were cold at that time of the year.
I went over the street to that famous old-
time Newcastle hostelry, the Ship Inn.
A familiar voice—a hearty, hospitable
Irish voice—was sounding in the parlor.
“No, sir—not much —’tis with me you will
drink, and at my expense, too.”
I beckoned to the barmaid.
“Who is that little, stout gentleman?” I
asked, nodding towards the man to whom my
agent—for, of course, it was Spruhan—was
talking.
“That’s the Mayor of Maitland,” she an-
swered with an air of vicarious pride.
“Pretty poor man, as Mayors go, I sup-
pose?”
“One of the richest men in the whole dis-
trict,” the barmaid replied.
_ But my agent appeared to be a much
richer man.
I suddenly appeared before him —looking,
or, rather, intending to look, like the statue
of the commandant in “Don Giovanni.”
Was Spruhan paralysed? Did he glare at
me with a look of conscious guilt in his
eyes? Not much. He greeted me with
enthusiasm.
“Look at him,” he exclaimed, slapping the
Mayor on the shoulder. “Look at him!
There lie is. No airs ; no arrogance about
tym. And yet when he likes to take the
trouble, he can talk like the Twelve Apostles
at Pentecost. It’s proud of him I am, and
it’s a whisky he’ll have now, or my name
isn’t Larry Spruhan.”
What could you say—especially if you
were feeling ill —to a man of such enormous
vitality and assuiance?
I could say nothing, but sat down grimly,
and drank my ordered whisky with my
agent, and the little barrel-stomached Mayor.
The latter informed me confidentially that
when he was a younger man he used to write
poetry, but later on he took seriously to the
drapery line, and in time became what I
saw. The moral was obvious.
The Mayor was a decent little fat soul, and
wished to set them up again. But for me it
was quite enough that a moral should be
obvious without being offensively so.
I left my agent and his august companion,
and went over to the Newcastle Morning
Herald office. A friend of mine was edit-
ing the paper at the time. I told him about
my lecture. “Never heard a word about it
before,” he said. “We’ve received no adver-
tisement, anyhow.” He sent a lad out to
inquire, who came back with the informa-
tion that no posters and no bills had been
put out. But a hall had been taken some-
where down on the wharf at the coalscuttle
mouth of Hunter-street.
I dined with my friend the editor, and, in
the evening, returned to my hotel just in time
to see a blue swag being violently flung out
of the door into the gutter. My agent stood
with unsteady legs astraddle over it.
“Does this man represent you?” said the
landlady.
“God forbid,” I replied.
An hour or so afterwards I met Spruhan
in Hunter-street, and said : “What the devil
do you mean by disgracing me in this
fashion? And what did you mean by carry-
ing around a swag? You an advance agent!
And common blue sundowner’s blankets,
too!”
“I thought we might need them before we
had finished the tour,” he remarked. He
looked so innocent, and so droll, and so
weirdly irresponsible that I gave him another
drink to straighten him, ar.c! enough silver—
he was dead-broke, of course —-to see him
through till the following day.
I met him again, by appointment, next
morning.
He was a compost of rum and coal-dust.
“Where did you stay last night?” I in-
quired.
“I slept in the cemetery,” he replied. And
this was the smart, vivid, acute man who
had a few days before posted me up in the
whole theory of up-to-date lecturing!
I paid his passage back to Sydney, and
saw his swag and himself on board the boat.
I was too sick to get drunk on my own
account. And, of course, that was the end
of the lecturing tour.
Yet, as I look back again at tliosp old
days, I would give all I can make in a year
to see once more Spruhan with his slouch
hat upon his head, and the droll twinkle in
his straight eye, and the blue swag upon his
back.

Every
Engineer
Knows
That to run a Steam Plant Economically
you must have Dry Steam. The only
efficient method to adopt to ensure your
steam being free from water is to lead
the water with the steam to a proper
collector, and discharge it through a
Steam Trap. But you must have a Trap
that is Reliable and does not Beak.
THE “SENTINEL”
High Pressure STEAM TRAP
Is Tested to 2501 b. Pressure, and is guaranteed
to remain tight even after much use.

Philips Pressed Steel Split Pulleys.
THeir Pleasing Design, Strength & Facility for Ereding
commend the Philips to all SRilled Engineers,
That noticeable feature—THEY ALWAYS RUN TRUE—is secured by careful methods of boring
the centres so that perfect concentricity is obtained. Wobbly pulleys are the results of inaccur-
acies in boring the centres and lack of care in the construction of the BUSHES. A Patent
Interchangeable Bushing System allows of their being utilised on various sizes of shafting—
and being split can be taken down and mounted without disturbing other equipment.
Allow us to demonstrate, as a power- and money-saving proposition, the adaptability of instal-
ling Philips Pulleys in your plant. Write for Price Lists and Discounts.
