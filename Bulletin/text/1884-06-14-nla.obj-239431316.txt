France and Australia.
Undbr the heading of “Political” we pub-
lish to-day a translation of an alleged con-
versation between Sir Henry Parkes and a
representative of Le Matin, a Parisian daily
newspaper. We need not concern ourselves
at all with the authenticity or accuracy of
the published report. The language which
either came out of the mouth of Sir Henry
Parkes, or was put into his mouth, is iden-
tical in effect with a good deal of what has
been said and published at this end of the
world. There was nothing said, in fact,
that was not equally spirited and appro-
priate. The disposition of the French Go.
vernment in relation to the interests of the
Australian colonists must be regarded as, in
the diplomatic sense, distinctly unfriendly.
The history of Australian development is
one unprecedented in history. An enor-
mous territory, for the most part capable of
being applied to productive uses, and the
discovery that it contained immeasurable
treasure of tho precious metal, imparted an
exceptional impulse to its settlement, and
precipitated it by bounds and leaps from the
condition of an Alsatia to that of a re-
putable and law-abiding community. It is
mainly to those combined attractions that
Australia emerged from the condition of a
penal settlement to that of a law-abiding
andgprogressive community. But for these,
the original element would not have been
swamped and dissipated amidst an over-
whelming access of reputable colonists. The
preponderance of the latter element enabled
the people of Australia, early in their his-
tory, to show such a front to the Imperial
authorities as peremptorily terminated the
flow of objectionable accessions to the popu-
lation. There are no grounds for supposing
that this history would be repeated in New
Caledonia. The requisite conditions appear
to be altogether lacking. The attractions
for free settlers do not at present exist, nor
is there any indication or reason to suppose
that they may develop later on. Any ex-
periment which the French Government
may make in that colony must be more or
less at the expense of Australia. There is
no manner of doubt about the danger to
which these colonies are exposed. And it is
of such a nature —involving a renewal, in
fact, of the infiltration of those bad elements
which the colonists long ago refused to
receive from their mother
there is no extremity of resistance which
Australians will not be justified and right
in opposing to it.
• *
In so serious a case,however, there is a special
necessity for the profoundest consideration
of every step which may be proposed, and for
the most sagacious foresight in all particulars
of the policy of resistance. Mere fretfulness
and excited clamour may be more hurtful
than helpful. The violent declamation and
precipitate swagger which characterise the
remonstrances and attitude of the Victorian
Government on the subject, strike us as
singularly maladroit. The position is so
thoroughly embarrassing, and so hedged
round with difficulties, that mere brawl-
ing can only deepen them. It is ex-
tremely foolish, in any dispute, to
threaten more than one can certainly per-
form. And that is precisely what is done,
when such intimations are made as that re;
ferred to by the correspondent of Le Matin
in his interview with Sir Henry Parkes. To
olose the ports of Australia against the
vessels of a great Power, betweon which and
Great Britain friendly relations and actual
treaties of commerce [subsist, would be a
step altogether too momentous to be accom-
plished without almost incalculable results.
In the first place, no enactment having that
effect could become law without first receiv-
ing the consent of the Queen--ui other words,
the endorsement of the Imperial Govern-
ment. Now, i t m ust be obvious, on very brief
reflection, that the relations of Great Britain
to France are governed by a multitude of
extremely involved considerations, among
which the state of matters in this quarter of
the globe is not necessarily the most im-
portant. Just as Great Britain sends hither
but a weak squadron of light vessels, and
maintains the real strength of her navy in
the Channel and in the Mediteranean, and
has actually stronger squadrons alike on the
Indian and China stations, so it may be con-
jectured that the weight of the departments
of foreign policy which bear in those direc-
tions may prevail in the Imperial Councils
over any question which may arise here.
The fate of the Empire still has its centre of
gravity in Europe, and depends upon nice
adjustments of alliances and mutual good
offices among the Great Powers. With the
future of Egypt trembling in the balance,
and Russia again advanced by a prodigious
stride towards one frontier of Hindostan,
while France has effected, in Tonquin, a
lodgement but slenderly partitioned off
from another frontier of “ the bright;
est jewel in the British Crown,” it
may be questioned whether there may
not be extreme reluctance on the part
of any British Ministry to pursue or coun-
tenance any course which would involve a
rupture—iu feeling even, if not in fact —
with France. The possibility must, indeed,
be taken into reckoning of the engagements
or complications of British foreign policy
being such that no consideration relating to
these dependencies would be of weight
sufficient to overbalance the objections to a
rupture at the present time.
• • •
Here, then, we have a very serious possi-
bility, apparently not at all reckoned for.
Local legislatures might in a heat pass laws
antagonistic to French trade, and hamper-
ing people of that nationality in the matter
of free access to Australia. And the Queen
might be advised to disallow such enact-
ments when passed by Australian Parlia-
ments. As a matter of ordinary reasoning,
it appears that any such measures most
certainly would be disallowed. Otherwise,
the entire theory upon which the affairs of
the Empire have, till now, been conducted
would be shattered. Dependencies would
be admitted to the exercise of supreme
functions, and colonial legislatures would be
recognised as entitled to hold the balance
between peace and war. If combined Aus-
tralian Legislatures could pass laws, and
have them assented to as a matter of right*
which are tantamount to a rupture of
friendly relations with a European power,
any Legislature in any colony possessing
constitutional institutions could do so; and
a grievance of the Cape colonists or the peo-
ple of British Columbia might precipitate
England into hostilities with Germany,
Italy, or Russia, at the same time that a
trouble in the Pacific had irritated an Aus-
tralian Legislature to bring about a war
with France or Spain.
• * •
It is, therefore, perfectly clear that there
may be too much vapouring about the Reoi-
diviste trouble, serious and really critical as
it undoubted is. There are two very impor-
tant questions to be solved. First, to what
lengths the Imperial Government will be
prepared to carry its interference on our
behalf; secondly, whether, in the event of
the home authorities declining to actively
follow our lead, it would restrain us from
taking our own part; and thirdly, whether
in oase.it were intimated that we must be
content to sacrifice the vital and moral
interest and future of Australia for the
benefit of the Empire in general, we will bo
prepared to resist by force the mother
country herself, or to separate from the
Empire and fight our own battles, unaided,
with the French nation. These are surely
alternatives startling enough to make
thoughtful Australians gasp, and to create a
distaste for the excited and superficial rant-
ings of Mr. Service and the Jingos of Vic-
toria. The tone which these persons wish
Europe to believe is the true ring of the
voice of Australia, is not really a manly one.
It is the expression of a bumptious small
boy, who threatens all who aggrieve him
with the wrath of his big brother. Let it be
considered that were a port of the United
Kingdom closed to French merchantmen, or
only kept open subject to insulting condi-
tions, the act would be equivalent almost to
a declaration of war. Is it likely that France
would tamely submit to be flouted by
a dependency in a fashion she would not
endure from the mother country ? And is it
likely that the mother country will (say),
sacrifice her grip of Egypt to satisfy Aus-
tralia, or will consent to a bouleversement of
her entire foreign policy for the same cause ?
Clearly the thing is more than doubtful. In
each instance it is unlikely. When a man
or a nation enters upon a dispute, ho or it
is unwise and likely to come off badly in the
end, unless the worst possibilities be taken
into account and prepared for. Before,
therefore, a rage is worked up with respect
to this reeidiviste trouble, it will be wise to
settle how far Australia is prepared to pro-
ceed in the matter, and whether the colo-
nists are ready to make the sacrifices which
a war—possibly without Great Britain for
backer—would demand. It may happen
that the eminently practical and commercial
spirit which has thus far predominated
amidst these bustling communities, may so
prevail over high moral and national senti-
ment, that when it came to the test tho
colonies would sooner put up with an influx
of blackguards than with the commercial
catastrophe and total suspension of gain-
making which a war would most assuredly
entail.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Challenged.
Among the brayings of the agitators In the Do-
main, there were occasional ringings out of
voicings clearly and significantly human. Ono
speaker, whose remarks appear to have been sup-
pressed by the reporter where they were most
significant, was, at least, allowed to appear in print
to the extent of an allegation that the members of
the Government let contracts to themselves
through a dummy contractor. We have heard
talk of this kind before, in connection with the
Parkes’ Government, as well as this Government,
and Members of Parliament generally. The evi-
dence in the ease of Watson v. Elkinoton, pointed
straight to an illustrative example. We do not
wish to give too easy credence to such
reports. When they related to men whose chief
was a person of notorious commercial immorality,
it was impossible to deny some belief in the possi-
ble truth of the rumours ; but every man, or set
of men, are entitled to the benefit of his or their
general reputation. If a man has obtained a ohar-

aoter for fair dealing and conscientious repugnance
to crooked ways, it is Just that there should be
long hesitation and demands for particular proof
before a rumour of corrupt practices on his part
Is allowed to influence people. The members of
the present Government are in that position. They
have certainly exhibited a deficiency of resolu-
tion and of nerve-power, but a disposition to
crooked ways and corrupt practices has not
been among their apparent defects up to
this time. They are in a position, there-
fore, to treat with contempt vague allegations
of malfeasance. On the other hand, however, a
particular charge has been formulated. A voice
from the crowd is not always a contemptible thing.
It has been publicly stated thac the omission to
enforce one penny of penalty on the contractors
for the Murrurundl railway, although the contract
was three years overdue, is attributable to members
of the Government being concerned in the contract.
This Is too definite a slander to be passed over in
Silence. The Government should prevent scandal
by at once answering this challenge from the
crowd. They should state publicly who is the
contractor for the Murrurundl railway; whether
this contract has exceeded the stipulated time;
whether any penalty has been enforced—and, if
not, why not.
So the Rev. Jefferis and others have talked
to such a tune that Mr. has ordered a
report from that world-wide authority, Inspector
Johnson, and he has recommended most of what
the men of noise have clamoured for. Scripture
lessons are once more to come into prominence in
the schools; and schoolmasters who smile over the
puerilities of Jewish history, are to be bribed by the
State by extra marks to relax their efforts in
teaching reading and the common sense teach-
ings of human fair play. That is, the feats of Sam-
son, and the movements of a primitive race of
wandering nomads, the witch of Endor and the
Lot business in salt, are to take the place of in-
struction in the constitution of star, and
fruit, and flower. The raids on Hittites and
Amorites, and the sites of Gilgal and
Gilboa, with their bloody memories, are to be
kept current, while Bull Run, Khartoum, and the
interests on which the sun shines to-day, are to be
kept out of sight for another generation, because
a few blindfold brawlers will not wake up and
see that right conduct and the knowledge of past
and present heroism are the only hopes of a vir-
tuous generation, and that the substitute that
they have been victorious in giving our children
is inoperative on children’s morals, destructive to
those of the teacher, and only an antiquated nos-
trum which every Intelligent child will have a
painful struggle to forget within a few years. A
people who permit this ecclesiastic reaction de-
serve it.
Ar’ y’ theer, Sandy Stooart? Weel, then,
jest catch hold on this, ma pauky skyte, an’ see
what yer driddle-waddle or deeplocmacy’s dooln
for the puir wurkin mahn oot westwards. Quite
recently the Government telegraphed to the
contractors for a certain line of railway
asking whether they could And employment
for 25 men at 5s. a day. The contractors
jumped with joy, and yelled, per wire, “ Yes. Send
them along immediately.” And it came to pass
that the men were sent along by rail at the
State’s expense-a matter of something like £35
at the very least. They arrived last Saturday
week, and immediately the shrewd contractors
discharged 25 men, who had been slaving at from
7s. to 7s. 8d. a day, and set the new men to work for
5s. Call ye this a backing of your friends, the
unemployed ? Go to 1 You simply pass the trouble
onwards, at a loss to the revenue, and to the cruel
injustice of honest, hardworking labourers who
never troubled you for assistance. Like Mr.
Mlcawber, and his promissory notes. Premier
Stuart writes a “ pass ” for the clamouring unem-
ployed, and then gleefully rubs his hands and
observes “ Thank God, that’s settled, and the poor
man is now fully provided for.”
Ah, ha! The time has come at last, and
the whole perfesh, from the coruscant star down
to the ten-bob-a-week-and-flnd-your-own-sooks
super, is now about to revel nightly In gastrono-
mioal delights thatwouid make the mouth of even
one of the mummied Pharoahs water. No more
wooden hams, canvas chickens, and glittering
goblets filled with tan-pit-water tea are to bt
tolerated on the mimic stage, but the real articles
themselves are to be placed on the festive board,
and you can gamble allyou hold that ample justice
will be done to them by the now no longer poor
players. In a Parisian play produced by Octavo
Feuillet at the Gymnase, one whole scene is taken
up by a sapper—and, ye godsl such a supper, too.
Everything laid on is the real thing. There are
twelve covers, and there are seven courses served,
each course with its ows wine of the rarest and
best vintage. The well-known restaurateur, Mar-
gery. furnished the meal. Besides tne Major-
Domo, or “ Butler,” who, of course, oversees
everything, and himself serves the wines, three
of Margery’s well trained gar<;ons, dressea in fine
livery, are on the stage and do the waiting. Cruci-
fied OtBsarl Think of that, ye Irvings, Tooles, and
Terrys of this fair land of ours! But this is not
all. The London Surrey is about to rejoice in a
new piece, called “ The King of Diamonds,” by Paul
Meritt, who, bearing in mind the glorious example
of Mr. Crummies when he ordered a tragedy to
be prepared solely for the purpose of introducing
a set of wash-tubs, has succeeded in obtaining the
use of a real Nordenteldt machine gun made by
the eminent Mr. Nordenfeldt himself. The breech-
loaders to be used in the piece have all been lent
by the Henry Rifled Barrel Company. The local
colouring is obtained in a great measure from a
book by Charles Du Yal, called “ With a Show
through Southern Africa;” and now, hare comes
the joy. The last scene (which is sure to be encored)
will represent an English camp laagared, with the
Dutch lines in the distance, and, just to preserve
the “ unities ” of the play, buckets of real lager
beer will be provided for the troops. All a supe.
will have to find will bo a good, reliable, Desert-of-
Sahara thirst and a quart-pot, and he can then sail
along to glory. If we can’t be an angel, and with
the angels sing, all we’ll ask for is to be a Surrey
super, and allowed to stand in the front rankq of
the lager-liokera in “ The King of Diamonds,”

The latest growl from woman is that she is
defrauded of her due rights in the matter of
pockets. While a man can safely stow away his
own (and his neighbour’s, if he’s not over consci-
entious) little indispensables in his army of
pouches, poor woman rightly grumbles that she is
limited mostly to one pocket, that it takes close on
half-an-hour to get at, and, when it is got at,
isn’t worth anything, as far as its carrying capa-
city is concerned. Woman should pocket this
affront no longer.
When I want to accomplish anything, says
a lady friend who sends us a sparkle now and then,
I always dress up. A woman’s success anywhere,
in public or private life, mainly depends upon her
get-up. She may have splendid brains, but if her
dress is shabby, no one stops to find out what her
qualifications may be. Yet, if a woman is a fool,
and has tact enough to garb herself in exquisite
attire, she takes the front seat every time, while
she of the brain-power sits back and smiles, if she
has sense. But if she has both brains and beauty—
why, then she can just roll this poor little globe of
ours under her omnipotent foot, and twenty mil-
lions of women will copy every tag she wears. For
myself, I despise the accent which is placed upon
dress, to the exclusion of womanly qualities ; but
since Mrs. Grundy will have it so, she rules. Never
fight the voice of criticism, especially among
women, for the sake of a few yards of stuff. Dress
well; above all, be Men gantee, and you may meet
your enemies in the gate.
As Artemus Ward says, there’s a good deal
of human nature in men and women,and the thirsty
desire of each sex to acquire a knowledge of the
other is one of its striking features. The “ model "
which was the original of a celebrated English
picture just sold was a girl of singular beauty,
and during its painting several young students
were studying under the artist. One day a curious
grating noise, from the passage in which the house
porter sat, attracted notice. Looking up, the
artist saw the point of a gimlet just appearing
through the wooden wall, and a sudden entry into
the passage disclosed the amiable porter with his
eye glued to the orifice he had just completed—
apparently, with artistic ideas of beauty, “study-
ing from the nude.” On being reproached for his
peeping-Tom proclivities, the virtuous gimlet-
twister averred that he only bored the holes “ to
watch the young gentlemen a-painting.”
Socialities on the Never Never. Half a
dozen lady visitors to a certain station, are having
a friendly after-dinner “mag” together, and
amongst the fair group is a leader of city fashions
and of very high tone indeed. The hostess, a real
rough diamond, in her way, enters, and being
desirous of paying the culchawed dame a compli-
ment, says “ Me and John hev just been having an
* argy ’ about the proper way to address a bishop.
Now, Mrs. , just decide it for us. You ought to
know, because you are certainly the very rankest
lady about the whole district.” Urgent business
called that oity lady home next day.
“Madge” writes the truth when she de-
clares that the extremity of some poor ladies is the
opportunity of their richer sisters. There are
pieces of old lace, fans, jewels, dinner services, and
many other things, that could tell thoir own tales
of unholy “bargains.” The “ beating-down ” pro-
cess is easy when poverty helps. She heard a woman
say once, when it was a question of buying some-
thing of an impoverished gentlewoman : Is she
veryvoorf' “Verypoor, indeed,” was the reply,
“ and in want of the ordinary necessaries of life.”
“Oh, then, I should think she would take ten
shillings, and be glad to get it. You may tell her
I shan’t give more.” This story of Madge’s re-
minds us of the yarn about the fat nu n who was
robbed of his hat. “ Why don’t you follow the
thief?” asked a bystander. “I’m so corpulent, I
can’t stir a step without losing my breath.” “ Not
a step?” repeated the interrogator. “Not a step
if my life depended on it.” “ Then here goes for
your wig ”—and the wig went after the hat.

Beach’s persistence had the desired effect
and on Monday evening a match was fixed up fora
race on the Champion Course, Parramatta River,

There is nothing new under the sun, and
for the truth of this dictum, wo have the authority
of the wisest of mortals. Custom and fashion but
repeat themsolves in the vaunted ideas and notlens
of modern times, and this fact is singularly well
exemplified In the odds and ends of our daily
dress. The crinoline of the present day is but a
reproduction of the hoop of Queen Anne’s and
later reigns ; the fashionable high-heeled boot is
only a doubtful improvement on the pattens and
clogs of our great-grandmothers; and we might
almost go so far as to say that the dainty attire of
the exquisite of the 19th century, is but a reason-
able modification of .the fig-leaf garments of our
first parents. Indeed, it is only because science
and knowledge have taught us to make West of
England tweeds and pearl buttons, that we are not
now “walking in the Zoo” in goat-skins, tied
together and fastened up with dear's sinews, and
artistically arranged fist-bones. We did think that
the old-fashionea shopkeeper, the vendor of every-
thing from “Bibles and bacon” to “godly books
and gimlets,” was extinct—at any rate, incur largo
cities Not a bit of it. The Magic Wand of Harle-
quin Time, has but turned him into “ The Univer-
sal Provider,” who utterly eclipses his humble an
cestorin excellence and usefulness; and, endowed
with the name and virtues of Anthony Hordern

gap in our social wants, and possessing a value not
easy to estimate.
Political Points
The New Queensland Land Bill will, if
Eassed into law, be the first attempt to give effect
y legislation to a large portion of the land theories
of George, Wallace, and Spencer.
General Roberts has ordered places to be
selected In every cantonment in the Madras dis-
trict, where works arc to be erected to bo held in
cases of emergency as “places of refuge.” Does
Fred smell a rat ?
At present, Bismarck’s policy is based
upon three political exigencies (1) A close and
Intimate alliance with Austria; (3) friendly rela-
tions with Russia; (3) the isolation of France from
all Continental alliances. So far he has succeeded;
and, during his lifetime, this policy will probably
maintain Prussia in her present commanding posi-
tion. After him, the deluge.
Mr. John Bright has been reminding his
political friends that in war the working-man pro-
vides most of the blood that is shed, and that upon
him chiefly fall the poverty and misery which war
occasions oy the increase of taxes and the damage
to industry. “ Household suffrage in boroughs
and counties will provide the means by which our
people may defend themselves against these enor-
mous evils.”
The World wails“ No one can complain
that our Court is unduly exclusive. At the last
the husband of a famous Court milliner was
presented; and at the drawing-room, the daughters
of a well-known tradesman.” It was something
like a Court when it only admitted a criminal
colonel of hussars, adulterous dukes, lecherous
lords; but when common people, who earn their
own living, get in, why, it’s shocking I
London magistrates committing to prison
miserable parents who cannot pay their fines under
the School Board Act, and whose furniture, if dis-
trained upon, is not of sufficient value to satisfy
the claims of some four or five shillings and the
cost of the man in possession, unless the beds,
tables, and chairs necessary for domestic use are
seized. That such poor souls should be fined at all
under such conditions is a scandal and a shame.
Under the heading “ The Imperial Link,”
the D.T. furnishes us with some lugubrious ex-
tracts from Parkes’ article in the Nineteenth
Century, from which it appears that the Austra-
lian in England still persists in playing the English-
man in Australia. Concerning all the vaticina-
tions of these returned Australians, and their
everlasting clack about Federation and “Links,”
we have nothing to say, but that we are full up of
having our relationship to the Imperial Link
stated by Missing Links.
If the hair of Victorians doesn’t grow
eurly from this day forward, it is not in unguents
or lotions that hopes of capillary loveliness can be
reposed. The Queen has placed her hand on the
head of Victoria. Mr. Murray-Smith writes to the
Premier telling, in words of wonder, that he for-
warded the original of Service's letter of condo-
lence to Her Majesty, and that Her Majesty-ha,
listen to this! —didn’t return it, “ which is a strong
mark of Her Majesty’s appreciation of the sym-
pathy ” of Victoria I
The Legislative Council has been giving
reasons for its disagreement with the Assembly’s
proposal to allow attorneys to appear in the
Divorce Court. By simply disagreeing.lt would
have proved its value as a drag (that is, would
have justified its existence to those who believe in
the necessity of obstruction). By giving reasons,
which are no reasons, it simply raises the question :
Of what use can be a Chamber that cannot read
the signs of the times, that is not in harmony with
the spirit of reform, that is Busbyish-Piddingto-
nian-Jacobian-Hazy ?
Mr. A. A. Tighe, who has just resigned his
seat in the Sydney Assembly, was what might be
called a still-born Minister. Anyway, he holds the
belt for being the shortest-lived portfolio holder
that ever held office in Australia. A dying Ministry
made him PMtnsaster-General in the morning, and
in the evening the whole crowd were bundled out
of office. This almost comes up to political life in
Spanish America. Over there, it is nothing unusual
to have two or three revolutions and half a dozen
changes in the Government between sunrise and
breakfast time.
The manager of the Holmhurst Estate,
Fiji, was recently fln«d £5 for improperly sending
“men” to the hospital, and mounting guard over
them with a loaded gun; and £1 for sending sick
"men” into the field to work—facts which will
prove, first, that slavery is practised in Fiji under
the nose of the Lord High Commissioner of the
Pacific; and, secondly, that the Government of
Fiji (i.e„ the aforesaid Lord High, ete.) is not averse
to indirectly benefiting by it; else, sending sick
men into the field to work would have rendered
the perpetrator thereof liable to a penalty really
proportionate to the black atrocity of the offence
—a penalty touemog the person and not the pocket
of the offender.
A return has just been laid on the table of
the Assembly containing copies of all pamphlets,
&c., issued by the Agent-General relating to immi-
gration. Amongst these is (to quote Samuel's own
words) “the copy of a handbook on New South
Wales, prepared and issued by the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge, the information
for which was furnished by me.” Chapter v. of
this handbook is headed “ Church and Religion,”
and, of course, only contains Anglican informa-
tion. There are two appendices to the work, that
headed “B” containing “Prayers for the use of
Emigrants.” Whether it be the duty of the Agent-
General to supply copy for a sectarian handbook
is a question pretty certain to be raised, more
especially as (save in those portions where it is
merely statistical) it is a very silly little book, ab-
solutely offensive in parts, through its asinine
goodygoodyness.
Phew ! Talk about rubbing the masses up
the wroug way, and propagating seditious lan-
guage, why, Pat Ford, O’Donovan Rossa, and even
old Smith, of “scent-bottle ” renown, are never in
it when placed by the side of the present Bishop
of Newcastle, England. Preaching at Newcastle-
on-Tyne, the other day, this pugnacious prelate
declared “ one of the characteristics of the age
was the increase of wealth and the concurrent
poverty side by side. The increasing luxury of
the rich was terribly multiplying the misery
amongst those from whom the wealth was with-
held. If England could not find a solution for
mis evil, one might possibly be forced upon her.
The land is the property of God, and must not be
sold, bought, rented, or mortgaged.” His Lord-
ship must have been rending George in bed, after
a supper of Spanish flics, gunpowder tea, and
devilled kidneys.
When bishops talk liberality it is time to
watch them closely, since one may be cocksure
something’s at the back of it. Bishop Barry has
just made a big profession of his anxiety for all-
round freedom. We trust ho means it. But there
is just a suspicion that he is plotting an attack
upon the object of his professed anxiety. The
Protestant denominations constitute a numerical
majority. If their ministers agree on a coprse of
-action, and can only keep their flocks in band,
what is to prevent them from making the secular
schools Protestant schools ? That is the ministe-
rial idea ; and, to secure that end, it is rumoured
that churchmen and dissenters are to be asked to
unite. We don’t believe for a moment that a
majority of laymen will follow their pastors to the
perpetration of such a great wickedness; but only
think of the injustice of the idea I If it be enter-
tained by the heads of the Protestant denomina-
tions (as there is reason to believe it is,) what a
commentary is the fact upon the recent words of
Dr. Barry : “ There is no tyranny half so absolute
as that ot the majority.”
Fifteen years ago, Ben. Butler, of Massa-
chusetts. then a Congressman, made war upon the
sinecures and quasi-pensions, which were leeches
upon the Federal body politic. He was met by the
whispered word, “patriotism.” But, finally. Gene-
ral Butler thus undermined even that word. Sap-
ping and mining one day in an almost forgotten
catacomb under the dreary building known as the
"Capitol,” at Washington, he encountered a spec-
tral-looking individua 1 , who seemed disposed to
escape observation. “ Who are you ?” queried the
investigating Congressman. “Keeper of the
General Washington crypt.” “ ButGeneral Wash-
ington was buried at Mount Vernon, twenty miles
from hero.” “Nevertheless, yonder is his crypt.”
" Are you paid a salary ?” "1 have fifteen hundred
dollars a year, and I succeeded my father in the
office,” This sent the investigator to the records,
who discovered that sixty-five years previously a
certain Congress, expecting to entomb General
Washington under the Capitol, had established a
crypt and a keeper ot it. Other Congresses forgot
the subject, but the salary survived, while the
“ patriotism ” of successive secretaries of ihe
Treasury forbade inquiry into the subject. Very
soon afterwards, upon narrating his tale to the
House—shouts of laughter drowning “ patriotism ”
—General Butler passed his Anti-Sinecure Bill.
The outpourings of the press have been
(says an English weekly) both mendacious and ex-
travagant—indeed, so ludicrously toadylsh, that
even the Queen herself seems annoyed and ashamed
by their flattery and fulsome flunkeyism. It was
asserted in the Times and some other journals
that, on hearing ot the death of her son, his
mother was so terribly overcome that she tumbled
to the ground head over heels. This statement,
the invention of some servile scribe, was, how-
ever, met by the following contradiction, pub-
lished by the Court Newsman :—“ The statements
which have appeared in several of the dally jour-
nals respecting the manner in which the Queen
received the news ot her son’s death are incorrect,
and the account of Her Majesty falling to the
ground Is without foundation.” The Queen has
awakened to the absurdity of the Royal Family so
frequently posing as the principals in acrobatic
performances. Some time ago we were told of the
Duke of Connaught tumbling out of a window at
Marlborough House, after dinner, and slightly
injuring himself. During the lifetime of the Duke
of Albany we heard of his constantly falling down
and Injuring his leg. Then the Queen, the news-
papers informed her subjects, lolled over after
lunch, and sprained her ankle. The deceased
Prince, it appears, rolled down a flight of steps
just previous to his death, and the newspapers
would have it that the Queen tumbled down on
hearing of her son’s exit from this world I This
was too much, and hence the contradiction by the
Court Newsman.
The experience of the London Board
Schools has revealed the appalling destitution of
thousands on thousands in the richest city of the
richest country in the world. Children subjected
to the educational process have fallen off their
seats, fainting from want of food, lips have turned
Sale, the thread of strength has given way, and it
as been discovered that at certain times of the
year a large large percentage of the children come
to school unfortified by food, and depart from it
with but a very poor prospect of any sustenance
before bed-time. These are not mere accidental
or sensational cases, they are only too common
and too prevalent. Certain kind and energetic
women came to know of this distress. They deter-
mined that if they could avoid it, the children
should starve no more. With the aid of the School
Board authorities and the teachers, they satisfied
themselves that the children were being starved
simply because the domestic cupboard was bare.
Collecting same small sums from the charitable, nt
the outset, they commenced a series of periodical
dinners for these poor waifs. Scarcely had this
excellent mission been started, when the pro-
moters of it were assailed with invective by the
philosophic philanthropists. This was a form of
out-door relief Intolerable to the mind of a certain
section of Bumbledom. The good women who
were feeding the hungry little children, were told
that they were pauperising and degrading the
people, they were encouraging the poor in idle
and vicious habits, and they were by this charity
opposing the first principles of modern organisa-
tion in connection with the poor. Never, for one
moment, was any alternative proposed.
In New Zealand, recently, two leaders of
public opinion have spoken, and it is worth while
to contrast their utterances. One of the speakers
is Sir George Grey and the other Sir William Pox.
The one is the advocate of reform in the Land-laws
and the other the N.Z. apostle of Total Abstinence
and defender of the Faith against the advancing
tide of Freethought. Sir George gives his hearers
a vivid description of the appalling misery exist-
ing at the present t ime in the great cities of Britain.
He stated that 41 per cent, of the population of
Glasgow lived indwellings and hovels of one room
for each family. In the parks and public gardens
of London he had seen hundreds of men and
women, who had no homes and no money, sleep-
ing under the trees in miserably cold weather. He
had seen poor young girls, in thin cotton dresses,
spending the night on seats and benches in the
open air under tbe shadow of Buckingham Palace.
The Ancient Britons had no such hardships to en-
dure. The very poorest of them had huts to sleep
in, and freedom to hunt and fish in the woods and
streams. He attributed the present misery and
distress to bad land-laws, and warned his hearers
against perpetuating the system in New Zealand.
Sir Wm. Fox, lecturing in defence of Christianity
against Freethought, described a horse of a differ-
ent colour altogether. Misery and crime, according
to Sir William, were to be found in Pagan lands, and
happiness and virtue in Christian England, Ho
Intended soon to take a trip to the old country,
and on landing he would be surrounded with
innumerable proofs of the advantages of Christi-
anity. Such had been its effect in humanising the
people of England, that in the great metropolis he
would find on every side of him hospitals, lunatic
asylums, charitable institutions, missionary socie-
ties, and even a house of refuge and hospital for
homeless dogs. This was enough to convince him
that Christianity was a better investment than
Freethought. Any misery there might be in the
old country Sir William attributed entirely to the
“accursed drink.” The two worthy knights of
Maoriland have the true remedy between them.
Break up the monoply of big estates and stop the
drink traffic, and the cure is effected. It matters
little whether men and Jwomoulare Christians or
Freethinkers so long as they benave themselves.
A good Christian and a good Freethinker will go
to the same place when they die. God cares for
them all. Sir William, although you may not be-
lieve it I—
“ Christian or Pagan, Turk or Jew,
Mormon or Anchorite-
Distinctions that seem vast to you,
Are nothing in His sight.”
A friend in Paris has sent us a copy of Le
Matin newspaper of March 7, containing an ac-
count of an interview by a representative of that
journal with Sir Henry Parkes, in Lendon. We
translate the principal passagesA correspondent
of Le Matin has had, to-day, an interview with
Sir Henry Parkes, ex-Premier Minister of New
South Wales. No statesman is better informed
respecting public opinion in Australia than Sir
Henry Parkes, and the main object of his voyage
to Europe is, it appears, to acquire for himself a
complete understanding of the intentions of the
French Government on the subject of the trans-
portation of convicts to the French possessions in
the Pacific. “ One has only to refer it is Sir
Henry who speaks—“to the deliberations of the
Intercolonial Conference held in Sydney last De-
cember, to be convinced that public opinion is
unanimous on this subject. Energetic resolutions
have been voted on that occasion. These invited
Her Majesty’s representatives te make serious
representations to the French Government.”
“ Have the colonials, then, already had cause
to complain of the sojourn of French diportis at
New Caledonia ?” “ Certainly, admitting that the
number may be limited, and that New Caledonia
contain, strictly speaking, only political offenders,
it has, nevertheless, come to pass that crimes have
been committed among us by convicts who have
managed to escape shortly after their arrival; and
the feeling occasioned by these deeds has been
more intense than would have been the case had
these been the deeds of our own countrymen. It
will be understood, then, that the prospect of a
large increase to the criminal population of New
Caledonia cannot bo contemplated without resent-
ment by {ne puixm laisser f raids) the inhabitants of
our colonies, and that of a surety every step will
bo taken, on our part, to prevent the landing on
our shores of these unpleasant guests.” “What
could you do in such case?” “Well, if the re-
presentations of the British Government were
ineffectual, the colonials would undertake to
protect themselves. They would adopt such
measures and they would make such sacri-
fices, »s might suit the situation. All rela-
tions with the French colonies, and even with
France itself, would be broken off, and life would
even be made very unpleasant to the French resi-
dents, who are numerous throughout our English
colonies.” {On fera memo la vie dure aux residents
Franeais.) Parkes then referred to the anti-
Chinese legislation, and continued“ And nothing
could prevent us from making similar disposi-
tions with respect to other nationalities
France couldn’t make war on us without attack-
ing Great Britain. The Australian Government is
about to propose, it is said, an Act to shut its ports
against the vessels of the Messageries line.” “ Is it,”
asked the reporter, “with the object of breaking
off communication with France. Is it an applica-
tion of the law of reprisals?” “I know nothing
of any such design,” replied Sir Henry, “ but I am
confident that the Australian Government would,
in self-protection, go to the length of breaking all
connection with France and her colonies, should it
be necessary.”
Talk about Saul being among the pro-
phets! Why, it isn't a patch on the circumstance
that Dan -the jaynyil apologist—is now among the
preachers. A tew days ago, the West Sydney
representative wrote a private letter (for publica-
tion) to his dear Father Finnegan, the mimber-
maker of Qundagai, and, with charming simplicity,
Father Finnegan handed this ponderous epistle
over to his dear little Bailey, “just to read and
pass the time away.” and, of course, the unsus-
pecting editor fell into the trap, and published the
whole concern in all its repulsive nakedness. .At
the first glance, Dan s artful bit of gush would
appear to be a “discoorse” on the “Edycashin”
question, as 't opens up in this style:—“ If we are
to preserve the noble type of our ancestors in this
colony, or in Australia, we shall have to retrace
onr steps on the Education question—to give up
the shadow, the pretence, for the substantial
teaching of Christianity, which can only be done
effectually during the time when the mind of
youth is plastic; there is not, and there cannot be,
any incongruity in a child, boy or girl, learning at
once the Rule of Three, and acquiring some
knowledge of the life of our Divine Lord. This
great and most desirable change will take place as
soon as the thousands of pious God-fearing
Protestants realise that they have nothing to fear
from Roman Catholics who are now here in the
great continent of Australia, making such efforts
to maintain in honour and glory the priceless
teaching of Jesus Christ; but they have Just
fears, as fathers and mothers, to dread the
horrid consequences flowing from the life-
lowering, soul-destroying system, Infidelity." So
far, that lot might have been clipped from one
of Archbishop Vaughan’s Education Sermons, but
a little farther on the cloven “fut” sticks out, and
the “infamous Stuart Government” is withered
up. “This Infamous Stuart Government,” says
the preacher Daniel, “ was founded on the express
and clearly defined plan of excluding men from
their ranks on account of their tellgion. It was
publicly stated so by those who had most to do in
arranging the offices of the various Ministers, and
I need only point out the shabby way in which Sir
Patrick Jennings was treated by men—some of
them, at least, his inferiors in everyway.” Of
coorso, the illusthryous o-ra-thur wasn't a bit mad
at losing his chance of a share of the Ministerial
loaves and fishes at all, and therefore his champion-
ing of the great Sir Patrick’s cause is all the more
honourable to him, especially in the eyes of those
who, to use Dan’s own words, are mere“ innocent,
baby politicians.” As it would be utterly impos-
sible for the “frind av Wintwlrth” to sayordo
any thing of importance without slobbering over
the “ raoighty dead ” we are quite prepared for
the following conundrum, which asks—“ What
Catholic in this country would desire to see one of
his own faith in office if eve had men of the intel-
lect and undaunted courage of Wentworth, the
unswerving justice of Deas-Thomson, the manful
abhorrence of chicanery as evidenced in the life
of the Hon. William Macleay, or the incorruptible
and never to be forgotten William Forster?” Our
private opinion is that a great deal would depend
on whether the Catholic in question wanted a
Post-office, or a Conditional Purchase Inspector’s
billet, and then he would most decidedly prefer to
see a Protestant in power, because bitter experi-
ence shows that with some Catholic politicians it is a
fixed rule to kick away the ladder which has helped
them up to the pinnacle of their ambition. Having
worried the “Kdycashin thrubble” to death, the
janil Dan rips the “Stooirt adminishtrashin ” up
over the Orange magistracy business, and, then,
after indulging in a general rally, he winds up by
saying, “And, now, my dear Father Finnegan, I
think you will agree with me that the members of
the Stuart Government have earned the just con-
tempt of every man in the colony, and their de-
struction is a sacred duty which every honest legis-
lator owes to this and the generations that are to
follow us.” All this, of course, is very natural and
lovely, but certain persons who can read between
the lines declare that although the recording angel
may mb an onion over his eyes in order to enable
him to drop a tear big enough to wipe out Dan’s
recent attack on Dallev, still, the Catholic electors
of West ‘-’ydney don’t approve of onions, and,
therefore, when the time tor another election ar-
rives, the “frind av Wlntwirth ’’will have to look
round for another electorate if he wishes to plant
his “fut ” on the “ flure” of the House again. This
being the case, what would be easier, or more de-
sirable than for “my dear Father Finnegan” to
persuade his protege . Mr. Watson, to risk being re-
jected by the electors of Young, and to then exert
his Influence with the free and independent Gun-
dageese, in order to secure the return of “ My dear
Misthur Dan O Connor.” This being properly
worked, who can say, but that the time will como
when a third party in the Mouse will bo formed,
and the country blessed with the ruling of an-
other unholy alliance, the foremost members of
which will be. Sir ’Bnry Parkes, Mr. James Wat-
son, and Mr. Dan O'Connor ? The epistle of Daniel
to the Gundageese, was a “moighty cuteoidcah,
indeed,” but, we fear it’s too thin.

•* has been expressed at the smallness of the late
Charles Reade's personal property. It does not
amount to more than £20,000. Mr. Reade was
known to have been very unfortunate in his
theatrical speculations but no one had supposed
that these latter had left him m very poor.” It is
not so long ago that a literary man possessed of
£20,000 would have been a Croesus in his profession.
“Mr. David Blair, a wealthy Scotchman,
baa joined the Benedictine monks at Inverness,
a id mace over to them an annual income of £6600.”
We are authorised, however, to state that this
drivelling old dodderil is not the David Blair of
Victorian Review notoriety. That particular
David doesn’t believe in Benedictine monks, and
says they were never designed for a pure purpose.
When he joins anything it will be the “ great
majority,” and then all he’ll leave the Benedictines
can be poked in their eyes with a brad-awl with-
out injuring their sight one iota.
Upjohn, the Victorian fiaggellator and
“ worker-off,” delights to be heroic. The other
Sunday morning he took the air in that locality
where his “ cases ” most do congregate, and
lemed against a lamp-post, with a sort of “come
one, come all ” kind of expression, in defiance of a
mob of “the boys,” who speedily assembled
round him. Hangmen, now-a-days, don’t appear
to be endued with the modesty of dear old Cal-
oraft, who, throughout his interesting career,
preserved, as far as possible, a strict incognito.
llpjohn’s peculiarities may have the result of find-
ing him a hero’s grave.
General Grant's $200,000 make him the
richest ex-President since Buchanan. Mr. Hayes
has, perhaps, $100,000. Neither Johnson nor Lin-
coln had over $50,000. Pierce went into the White
House poor, but had about $50,000 going out. Fill-
more and Taylor were never rich. Taylor wa* a
bankrupt when he was President, married a for-
tune afterwards, and lost all in the war. Polk was
worth $150,000. Andrew Jackson had nothing but
his “ Hermitage.” Adams was rich. Monroe died
jiB debt. Jefferson bad nothing to leave behind
him. Washington was very well oJf. Van Buren,
who died worth $800,000, was the richest President
America has had.
Coleridge, Lord Chief Justice of England,
must be a nasty, horrid, old brute of a man, in-
deed. When asked to adjourn the Court, out of
respect to the memory ■ Prince Leopold, this
Pyrmont-quarry-stone-i ' -'od monster flatly re-
fused to do so. and sa' i >a his perch and went
on with his biz., just tli - one as If nothing at all
had happened. Arid the uuiy reasan this miserable
nian could assign for his brutality, was that “ he
had a duty to perform—to administer justice to
the suitors who were thronging the courts, and
besides, he had some criminal appeals to be con-
sidered, which affected the liberty of men then
lying In gaol, and who, for aught he knew, might
be suffering innocently.” Bo he declined to shut
his shop, and the funeral had to joggle along with-
out him.
John Copeland, of Melbourne, doesn’t be-
lieve any more in hasty marriages. John, you
must know, entered into the holy bonds of matri-
mony with very considerable precipitancy. Borne
eight weeks ago ho first set eyes on the fair widow
Read. She was reading a book in a hotel whither
he had gone to fetch his supper beer, and John—
to use his own words—was “struck with her.”
The widow, presumably, reciprocated the “strike,”
for four weeks later they became man and wife.
Scarcely had a fortnight of their honeymoon
elapsed, when the newly-made Mrs. C presented
John with a pledge of some person’s affection, and
the happy husband took an early opportunity of
lifting his blushing bride across the street. For all
that, John has been let in for “ maintenance.”
Poor John I
Recent home advices say that that distin-
guished Victorian littirateur, Mr. Arthur Patchett
Martin, who used at one time to write for—and
occasionally ire—Australian jourrials, has been
elected a Fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute of
London, Mr. Lawrence Benjamin, Melbourne; the
Hon George Shonton, M L.C, J.P., Mayor of
Perth, Wedt Australia; Mr. Sigismund Sinauer,
Sydney; and Mr. William C. Beattie, Queensland,
have also been similarly sentenced. Strange to
say, however, nothing is said as to the nature of
the crimes these unfortunate persons must have
committed to deserve suchanignomi- ious punish-
irlent. Arthur slings ink for Vanity Fair, and by
Competent judges he is reckoned to be the equal
of Archie Forbes—so far, at least, as veracity on
Australian matters is concerned.
Our old straight-half-mile of a friend,
Chang, the Chinese giant, is pretty well, thank you,
still; but we regret to say, dyspepsia is playing the
fallen angel with the long-’un’s vitals. For an
ordinary lunch, all that his weak stomach can hold
now is four large plates of soup, forty-three fried
oysters, two rar** tenderloin steaks, with nineteen
baked potatoes and two dishes of stewed tomatoes,
a large roast chicken, three bunches of celery, two
custard pies, one mince pie, one apple pie, five
cream puffs, six bananas, a pound of figs, two
oranges, twenty-six ginger snaps, and eleven slices
of bread and butter. He also drinks eight goblets
of water and four cups of coffee. Mrs. Chang
(who hails from Maynooth, by the way) is fre-
quently late with the dinner in consequence, and
then her old man reels off the sacred sonars of Li-
Kung and Confucius in a style that would scare
the soul out of even a Solomon Islander's wooden
god.
Lars Olsen Smith, though a big Swede, is
no turnip-headed fellow. After having made a
fortune by the manufacture of very questionable
brandy, he is now spending it as—don’t laugh—a
social reformer. Did not Rebecca Crawley (n6e
Sharp), her questionable days being over, settle
down to a life occupied In works of piety. Was
not her name on all the charity lists ? Did not the
Destitute Orange Girl, the Neglected Washer-
woman, the Distressed Muffin-man find in her a
fast and generous friend ? And why should any-
one grudge Smith the satisfaction of spending the
coin be made out of the degradation ot one genera-
tion upon the moral molleycoddllng of the next?
The gold that the adulterator, the conniver at
dummyism, the invoice-saiter, or such-like fraud,
puts into the plate on a Sunday, is it not as yellow,
as hard, and as intensely respectable as the gold
put in by Mr. James Watson or Mr. William Neill ?
So here’s to Lars Olsen Smith, the social reformer I
When the beardless little stone-slmger of
Israel took Goliath in the os frontis with a rock on
the plain of Terebinth, the assembled hosts were
not more astonished at the Philistine slogger’s
knock-out than the members of the Legislative
Assembly were on last Friday night when Ninian
Mel/llle boldly faced the mighty “Giraffe” and
sent him clean over the ropes. Said the Mudgee
six-footer: “It Is one of the highest compliments
that could have been paid to me to hear the hon.
member for Northumberland pooh-poohing my
ideas. What does he know about the land law ?”
Said the Newcastle Tom Thumb: "What do you
know about it?” Mr. Taylor: “If I didn’t know
more about it than the hon. member for Northum-
berland, I’d—well, I’d make my own coffin.” Mr.
Melville: “That’s what you’ll have to do—for
you’ll never be able to pay for one.” Then the
long ’un rolled over and croaked on the spot, ex-
claiming as he fell, “ Tell my people 1 died with
my back to the field and my face to the foe.”
Fortune du Boisgobey is a sensation novel-
ist. Though over sixty, twenty years ago M. du
Boisgobey had not begun his career as a novelist.
He had been in the army; he bad served in Africa-
It was not until 1868 that It occurred to him to try
his hand at literature. He wrote a sensation novel
or twe which proved successful. He not unnatur-
ally persevered, and soon became exceedingly
popular. Ponson du Terrail and Gaboriau were
not “ in it ” with the author of “ Le Crime de
1 Omnibus.” The work he turns out is sensational
with a vengeance, but eminently readable. It is
only rarely tbat, as in the case of “L’Auberge de
la Noble Hose,” Boisgobey permits himself to be-
come tedious. As a rule, his romances are absorb-
ingly attractive. If they are not always as ingeni-
ous as some of Gaboriau’s, they are generally far
more easy reading. They have no psychological
purpose to serve, no philosophic lesson to teach.
They are simply fairy stories told of the Paris of
to-day, instead of the Bagdad of the Just Haroun
or the No-man’s-Land of the fabulists.
Sold again! And by a Scotchman, above
all others. Crown Prosecutor Mere wether seldom
lets slip a chance of endeavouring to up-end his
honorable, but not learned, friend.” Buchanan;
but, as a rule, the doughty Dawvld, having the
advantage ot his Parliamentary experience, gener-
ally manages to knock his adversary over the
ropes. Up at Forbes, th® other day, for instance,
Mr. Merewether, in replying to the Mudgee iunlor’s
defence of a prisoner, said that Mr. Buchanan was
either ignorant of the law or was wilfully mis-
leading the jury. Dawvid struck the floor at
once, and denied the allegation with the same ex-
cited fervour as he defied the allegator. His Honor
thereupon touched Mr, Merewether on the raw
for charging the stern and wild Caledonian with
misleading tno jury. Mr. Merewether then apolo-
gised, but, by way of a Parthian shot, said he
would now have to fall back upon Mr. Buchanan’s
ignorance. Instantly the bluid ava’ th’ Buchanans
rushed madly through the Insulted chieftain’s
veins as he yelled, “ Fa’ back on yersel’, then, for
ye’ll find plenty o’ it there.”
Yet another effort is being made for the
release of the romantic murderer of poor bank-
clerk Kinder—the once tashionable Wynyard-
square dentist, H. L. Bertrand; and this time his
friends are determined to make a long pulhia
strong pull, and a pull altogether in his favour.
Bertrand has been a model prisoner since bis
incarceration, and it is said has also become highly
proficient as a painter of sacred subjects. It is a
rather strange anomaly that Bertrand is still
under the sentence of death. So that if he is
liberated, he will probably be the only man in the
world, who, being at largo, could be arrested and
legally hanged without a trial. And. as he was
ever in search of novelties when he was at large,
this Damooles-sword-like feeling will no doubt
have its charms for Mons. Bertrand. The last we
heard of his fascinating accomplice, Mrs. Kinder,
was that she was starring it as a New Zealand bar-
maid, where her infamsus history had earned her
a sort of notoriety. Sir Alfred Stephen was always
very much in earnest whenever he spoke ot the
advisability of spraining the neck of Mons, Ber-
trand.
Thorold Rogers, M.P. for Southwark, is
a shocking example of intemperance in book-
learning. Gifted with parts which might have
made him a good usher or a successful sea-lawyer,
habits of early Indulgence in ardent prints, un-
checked by knowledge of men, have reduced him
(says “Jehu Junior”) to the condition of a con-
firmed Professor. He professes everything. He
once even professed Christianity, so far as was
necessary to enable him to take holy orders; but the
latal vice of knowing more tha .i was good for him,
added to the absence of the office of Pope in the
Church of England, caused him to relinquish the
character ot parson, and to turn for distinction to
the fray of Parties. He stood for Scarborough in
1874, and was beaten; but in 1880 Southwark re-
turned him to Parliament and gave him a right,
which he has used mercilessly, to lecture, birch in
hand, the House of Commons, the Queen's Minis-
ters, and the universal earth. He was born owe-
and-vixty years ago. Re knows everything. He
is quite a clever man. He tells broad stories, and
says smart things of his adversai ies. Some of them
are true.
One who knows Khedives and Pashas well
writes as under in a description of Nubar:—“If
you must talk politics, well, the blue spectacles
are put on, apparently to hide the closed
eyes, while the veteran assures you that the only
safety for Egypt lies in granting her the
maximum of progress with the minimum of
change. With a profusion of Mon Diem! and a
chuckling laugh, he will tell you that Egypt has
endured since the time of the pyramids, and, he
thinks, will last as many years longer; that
changes happen in all countries; that they don’t
do much good; that Egypt must change naturally,,
but not too quickly. Shifting in his chair as he
reiterates this final argument, pas troy vite, he wilt

able with a sigh, and listen with an appreciative

Clifford-Lloyd because that head strong fellow
wouldn’t take his cue from him.
The Rev. Dr. Begg, that bigoted old
Scotch divine, who, up to the day ot his death,
roared out against the iniquity of permitting
organs in churches, seems to have had one green
sput in his heart, after all. Though his son,
“ Walter Bontley,” had strayed so far out of the
narrow way as to become a “ hactor,” and a verit-
able child of Satan (according to Begg’s lights), the
old mau didn’t quite forget that the erring one was
his son, but bequeathed him, in his last will and
testament, the snug sum of thirty thousand
pounds. When you remember that such as
M’Eachern and the rest ot the crew that hunted
Charles Strong out of this country are secular-
minded men compared with poor old Begg, it be-
comes evident tbat even a 1'resbyterian minister
can sometimes sacrifice prejudice to a sense of
duty. Bentley, we suppose, will give his legacy a
chauce in some theatrical speculation, in which
case he certainly ought, under the circumstances,
to stick to the " legit.” and high class drama. Tho
worthy governor would turn in his grave, if the
bawbees were laid out in the production of leg
pieces, that he would. By the way, another
clergyman’s son is one of the lion comiques of the
London Music-halls. He’s a fat, flash, tuneless
cad, na.med Harry Rickards, who once paid
Australia a visit, and who many years ago
was brought up before the beak for pitching intq

Mary Anderson, the heavenly beautiful
and angelically virtuous American actress, who
has been gathering together the dollars at the
Lyceum Theatre, London, made an error of judg-
ment Just at the very last moment of her engage-
ment. Mary’s “ farewell performance ” was an-
nounced for that particular Saturday when the
Prince—“ whose death is an irremediable loss to
the nation he adorned,” etc. etc.—was to give his
farewell performance, at Windsor. On the pre-
vious day ail the London managers received a note
from the Lord Chamberlain (good, useful man)
informing them that, although no commands
would he given for the closing of tne theatres on
the occasion of the Duke of Albany's funeral, still
“ they could act as they might think right.” With
the exception of beautiful Mary and her business
man, all the managers muttered a big big D, and
decided to shut up shop; but the practical Yankee
actress didn’t quite like the notion of losing her
“ben.”, so taking It for granted that the poor,
dead Duke wouldn’t be offended, she announced
her show in defiance of the Lord Chomber-
lain However, at the last minute. Mary con-
sented to be * taken ill,” and the theatre was
closed. This was after haying it explained to her
that “ Wales ” and other royal admirers might
withdraw their patronage on her next engagement
if she courageously stuck to the original intention.
Mary, to ner credit be it said, hadn’t thought about
the amorous Wales at all in the matter.
Here is a word picture of Matthew Arnold
lecturing upon Emerson:—“ Bland, suave, and
icily critical, as is his wont, he surveyed his
audience for a good five minutes, took a deep
draught of the Pierian spring from the customary
water-croft, and suddenly, with out-shot lips,
started off, in a monotonous sing-song voice, in
hot pursuit of Emerson. He talked in the irrita-
ting up-and-down cadence of a typical Oxford
parson ; he slung his sarcasms against the kindly
and gentle American thinker, like some blast
David, who had grasped a boulder Instead of a
pebble wherewith to slay Boston’s Goliath. His
only gesture was a somewhat weak and deprecia-
tory fashion of closing his hands in front of him-
self, and then waving them backwards with a
feeble flap. The lecturer’s real estimate of Emer-
son. He was a modern Marcus Aurelius— ‘ the
friend of those who would walk in the spirit.’
Bound and round the metaphysical mulberry bush
went the good Matthew. He dogmatised on ‘ hope-
fulness,’ ‘serenity,’ ‘lucid freedom,” and revelled
in glorified adverbs. What he evidently wanted to
say was that Emerson was kindly, gentle, joyous,
and human, but such easily understood words
were impossible to him; and so we contented our-
selves with ‘delicacy,’ and ‘elevation,’ and made
the most we could out of them. The general
effect of the discourse of the teacher who has
succeeded in irritating an entire continent, was
that he preached a doctrine of Bumptiousness/’
Bartle Frere, G.C.B., G.C.S.I., D.C.L., &o.,
went to his own place last week. Nephew of
Hookham Frere (one of the founders of the
Quarterly), he was born in 1815; educated at
Haileybury ; entered Indian Civil Service ’34 ; in
’42 became secretary to Sir George Arthur,
Governor of Bombay, whose daughter Catherine
he married (Arthur had been Governor of Tas-
mania) ; from ’56 to ’60 Resident in Sclnde; from ’62
to ’67 Governor of Bombay ; he claimed as special
Commissioner to Zanzibar, in ’73, to have brought
about the abolition of the slave trade (which,
however, still flourishes, despite the fact that he
got the freedom of the city of London in a golden
box for his successful exertions on behalf of the
nigger). Afterjdoing India in “ Wales’s ” suite, he
was appointed, in ’77, to the last official post he
ever occupied—that of High Commissioner of
South Africa, in which billet he surpassed all his
previous efforts as an intolerant, hypocritical,
Pharisaic jingo. An impious and sanguinary
fanatic, taking the name of God in vaiu, adding
the fuel of national bigotry to the flames of colo-
nial cupidity and race-hatred, he expended million#
in the wanton destruction of Zulu lives. Every
hideous massacre he prompted was preceded by
despatches abounding in phrases of edification
about the obligations of England as a civilised and
Christian Government, about the national guilt in
sanctioning elements antagonistic to the national
religion. The Zulu war, of which Bartle Frere
was the main instigation, was one of the
most atrocious crimes ever perpetrated in the
national history. Infamiam qui meruit ferat!
That poor Duke of Connaught! Accord-
ing to a lap-dog (who writes from Meerut), H.K.H.
“gets very little leisure, his time is fully occupied:
there are inspections every day this week, and
also a week’s race meeting.” Perhaps it wouldn’t be
amiss were Connaught to have even a little less
leisure, seeing how he employs it. Fancy a Son of
England—of that nation which professes such
anxiety to raise Hlndostan to a higher level of
civilisation—attending with his wife and their
respective suites an elephant fight got up speci-
ally in their honour by that brutal sensualist, the
Maharajah of Bhurtpore. The very self-same
lickspittle who thus sorrows that H.R.H. of Con-
naught should be so overburdened with the re-
sponsibilities of his high command, gives the
following details (in his own inimitable way) of
poor dear Arthur’s method of wearing himself
out by his high heroic devotedness to duty:—“ On
Thursday H.R.H. inspected the 13th Hussars, and
on Friday a day’s pigsticking was arranged. The
Duke got a first spear after a very long gallop of
over three miles. The boar was quite beat, and
tried to shelter in a small nullah, where H.R.H.
most cleverly stuck him. The Duchess saw the
sport (the clever sticking of a quite beat perker)
from an elephant. The Maharajah of Bhurtpore
gave T.R.H. a grand ffite at his palace.” As a set-
off against this patronage of drunken elephant
fighting, T.R.H. will probably plead their patron-
age of holy Mother Church, since we read of the
Duke having recently presented a cross and pair
of candlesticks, and the Duchess a handsome altar
cloth worked by herself, to the parish church of
Bagshot (Eng.)
A few days ago the gates of Darlinghurst
Gaol opened and there stepped out a party by the
name of Dr. Pearson. Sixteen years before this
eventful morn, the self-same gates had closed on
tne Doctor’s stately form, and, during the course
01 a brief conversation he had previously enjoyed
with a venerable old joker in a black cap, he was
cheerfully informed that his neck would be
sprained at an early date, and, if he felt at all
anxious for his comfort in the next world, it would
ce a prudent thing to make all the necessary
arrangements with one of the clerical advance
agents who generally did the gaol business. This
happened during the rcuseabout days of the bush-
rangers, when it was nothing unusual for the
mail-coach passenger to wake up just in

Hanlans and Laycocks of his time to pull one-man
races over, or did he want him to cut it up into
strips and make flags, and banners, and table-
moths, and things for his temperance guilds to
slosh around with ? Did he want Timothy to
rub it on his saintly “ turn” like St. Jacobs Oil, and
expect him to be three times the man he was

Get out, Brother Booth, with your zoedone drivel,
and don’t play such a low down game on men
who died 1800 years ago, and are consequently
too sick just now to stand up and take their own
part, Paul distinctly said, “ Do not still drink
water; but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake
—[Query: Stomach ache?—Ed. B.]—and thy fre-
quent infirmities;” and this clearly proves that St.
Paul didn’t gamble very much on the medicinal
properties of cold water. Like Brother Booth, we
too, are glad that Paul told Timothy to use a little
wine, because our inference is that the latter party
used to abuse it—get “ on the Heliogabalus ” (as
they used to call the “Jamberoo” in those days);
and we venture to think our deduction is far more
reasonable than that put forward by the flat-
catcher from the “goldarned carntlnint of Anau-
rikur.” And look here. Brother Booth, we want
no new-fangled readings of our Scriptural texts,
and, least of all, such readings as you can give us.
Go home, Brother Booth, go home.
After all, young Russell, the defaulting
assistant railway station-master at Orange, who is
now mixed up with the deepest-dyed roughs in
Berrlma gaol, appears to have been as much sinned
against as sinning. From the evidence of Mr,
Thompson, the accountant, it is clear that superior
railway officials have been allowed to wink at
little laches on the part of some of their subordi-
nates, and that a certain license is allowed to well-
connected young men placed in positions of trust,
provided they are able to make up their deficien-
cies when required. It is right here that young
Russell came to grief. He bad *• temporarily ap-
propriated” certain moneys belonging to the
Government, fully intending to repay the lot
when he was flush of funds. This, he was unable
to do when the critical moment arrived, simply
because his salary, which was sworn to be lawfully
due to him, had not been paid. Furthermore, it
appears from the evidence of the station-master
that sums of from £75,000 to £80,000 probably
passed through this unfortunate youth's hands
during the past seventeen months, and yet all he
received for his services was a paltry £96 per
annum, and—this is a true touch of departmental
meanness—“ the honour of being styled Deputy
Station-master of Orange.” Here was a young
man placed in a most Important office of trust, and
expected to keep up a good position and appear-
ance in one ©f our most important towns, on a
salary which can be easily earned by any of the
ragged little gutter-snipe hoodlums who peddle
the evening papers through the streets of Sydney.
The very “ honour of being styled Deputy Station-
master ” is enough to induce most young men to
‘overrun the constable,” and when this is done
on starvation wages—and the wages not even paid
up punctually—it is small wonder that the pro-
mising lives of so many unfortunate colonial
youths are blasted for ever by the hellish taint of
the cells of Berrima gaol. Why a Government
servant, who, whilst enjoying a salary of £600 a
year, embezzles £4000 should be placed under the
mild regime of Darlinghurst, and treated with
every consideration, and, at the same time, a
miserably paid lad is sent to herd with the time-
hardened scoundrels in Berrima for filching a few
paltry pounds, is more than we can very well
understand—unless, indeed, that what all the
world says must be true, and a good connection,
like charity, covereth a multitude of sins.
Our first impulse, on hearing of the death
of the Duke of Albany, was to rush out and either
invest in an inky cloak and a ten-guinea suit of
woe, or else perch on a edmmodious three-storey
dung-heap and scratch ourselves red with oyster-
shells and broken bottles, after the manner of the
fine old prophets of ancient times. Our second
impulse was to scoot round to the Telegraph office
and cable home our application for the vacant
billet. Our third was to do neither, but keep
on grinding away in the same old groove; and
now we’re downright glad we did so Somehow,
the life of a Duke of Albany does not seem to be a
particularly happy one, and we wonder why
parents can be found so hard-hearted as to bring
their eons up to the business. The title of Duke of
Albany has been adopted five times in Scotland,
and four times in England. In six cases, the title
became extinct with the life of the first recipient,
and four Dukes of Albany have died with their
boots on, which is the court way of saying' they
met with violent deaths. The title of this Duke-
dom haa never passed to a second generation.
This looks as if the second generations had rather
level heads, and a tendency to believe that it was
better to be a live flsh hawker even than a dead
Duke. Prince Leopold’s grand uncle, the Duke of
York and Albany, died at the age of 37, in a
strangely similar way to the late Duke, and about
thirty miles from the same spot. Fitzgerald, in his
‘ Lives of the Family of George III.,” says:—“ In
the month of September, 1767 (September 17), the
Duke of York and Albany, who was as usual tra-
velling abroad, was seized with a fatal Illness at
Monaco, and died. This gay aud interesting Prince
was not thirty years of age, and had made a favour-
able Impression on every one he encountered.”
The gay and interesting ” seems to have chalked
out the way for his successor to follow, as Fitz-
gerald continues” His Royal Highness hal
danced and eaten too much at the chateau of a
Serson of fashion, and this had not only fatigued
im, but occasioned a very strong perspiration.”
Strange to say, no historian ever mentions whether
the dunes drank too much or ever drank at ail. The
parallel goes further in some small items, the Cap-
tain Percivai of that day being Captain Wrottesley,
upon whom fell the unpleasant duty of breaking
the news to the Royal Family. All this is certainly
curious and interesting just now, the names of the
two Royal Dukes, their ages, the circumstances of
their deaths, and the locality all being so singularly
coincident. Even the dates (1767. 1881) have this
peculiarity: that if the numerals in each case be
added together they amount to the same sum.
Truth is stranger than fiction; and very much,
scarcer, too. That’s why we like to give it a show
occasionally.
Poor George Mizon, for whose murder
Cordlni will, in all probability, die the death, used,
at one time to keep the Buckeye Hotel out behind
the Big Hill, at Sandhurst (Vic.) Being in Sand-
hurst (Bendigo it was then, by the way), we used
(in common with a large and influential class), to
go out on the Sabbath for a drive. Looking back
from here at our career in those days, the conclu-
sion is forced upon us that we were awine-and-
spirit-bibber, and a scoffer at religion. For we
wouldn’t for the world drive out eight or ten miles
now on the Sawbath Just purposely to get filled with
Kangaroo Flat dust, in order that we might have
the fierce pleasure of afterwards laying it, in an
illicit manner, with Australian swipes. But we’ve
all got a skeleton in our back rooms, and the mem-
ory of those licentious goings on is our little fossil.
A terrible place was this same Big Hill before the
roads were made, when loading was £150 per ten
from Melbourne to Sandhurst, and you had to be
condemned gentlemanly to the carriers to get It
taken at that. It is on the main road between
Castlemaine and Bendigo, and in wot weather you
could always find a line of teams unyoked at the
bottom, waiting until their turn came to be hauled
up the hill by the com'-Ined horseflesh of
whole crowd. It was no uncommon sight to see
about two hundred horses crawling up this
ghastly height [Two hundred ! are you quite sure ?
—Bd.B.] with a waggon load of grocery behind
them. Very like a funeral procession this turn-
out looked, from a distance; but when you came
near enough (which wasn’t so very near) to
hear what the drivers were talking about,
you gave the funeral notion best, in a hurry,
and went in search of a cavern black
enough to hide your monstrous visage in,
Ye«, dear Kerristian readers, the teamster of those
days used either to blaspheme with his whole heart
and his whole soul, abetted by a focussed memory
and an active imagination, or let it alone alto-
gether. And we never knew one to let it alone
altogether-or even just a little. Later on, when
that irrepressible (we had nearly written “ redoubt-
able, but that belongs to Dick Thatcher) Scot,
J. V. A. Bruce—one of the wrought-lron figures
of early Victorian history, and the father of Cab-
bage-garden railways—was getting on towards Big
Hill with his cuttings, the locality became what is
known in religious circles as “dam hot.” At Big
Hill there is a heavy tunnel, and at the cutting of
this a vast horde of men were employed. And
lower down towards Harcourt (it was the ill-fated
Mizon who told us this) there was employed a huge
gang of Irish exiles—good and true •• Tips ” every
one—who had, even at that early period, some faint
beginnings of a notion that Ireland was being
knocked about, and that some day she would
arise, free and glorious, and trample the tyrannical
Saxon in the dust. Well, these boys struck work
one day, for some cause or another, and sent word
up to the Big Hill people that if (hep didn’t also
strike work, they (the Tips) would stroll up and
see about it, in the cool of the evening. But there
was no particular notice taken by the Big Hill
excavators of the mandate of Higgins’s party, and
they drilled and punched and blasted at the rocky
wall till “the sun dropped, and all the land was
dark.” Then the usual Saturnalia commenced,
and the young ’possums had their ears inexpres-
sibly shocked by ‘ sounds of Insult, rage, and
wrong” till midnight, when the silence of the
new great strange land came out of its hiding-
place and flopped down on the camp, and
everybody slept. Save one. That one, for
a marvel, was the only man in the camp who
had the “horrors” on that eventful night.
As he lay writhing among hideous phantoms in
his tent, something told him to rush out into the
? i £r t ?, and . m i a voice wild and awful as that which
told Qlamis to “Sleep no more” yell “ Higgins’s
men 1 Higgins’s men 1” which he at once did.
Most of the tents had the doors facing east, so the
camp kept on going in that direction till they were
pulled up in a trouserless and famishing condition
at Klama—where most of them died. It is said
that one aristocratic ganger, who had the only
night-shirt in the Australtas at that time, fled in
it, and is at the present time the real Kiama Ghost,
but we don’t know. Blankets and moleskins were
cheap along the line for the rest of the year, as not
one of them ever showed up again at the Big Hill
Camp, save thel man who had the horrors, and his
reward was great. The moral ofiwhich is—[There
is no moral.—Ed. B ]. Poor old Mizon I when he
told us these things how little could we dream
he was to die by the blow of a murderer, one day
far enough from there I By degrees the trade
withdrew from around Big Mill, and he went into
farming ; but it is poor granite soil, and the last
time we saw the Buckeye Hotel it was a mossed
old farm-house, gone about the elbows a good
d eal, and with a somewhat haunted expression
about it. And where once were waving crops :
“ The rabbit fondles his own harmless face,
The slow-worm creeps, and the thin weasel there
f ollows the mouse, and all is open field.”

George Street,
Just Opposite the Entrance to the Markets.
The Autophone Is a wonderful little instrument,
which, while It weighs less then three pounds, has
the lungs of a full-sized parlour organ, and exe-
cutes its.music with absolute precision and perfect
effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and
all the parts of most difficult music.
On it a child can correctly play, without instruc-
tion, any ot its music, which at present consists of
over 300 selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas.
Waltzes, Polkas, Marches, Popular Songs, &c. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, in which chords predominate, but also
has wonderful power in executing very lively
pieces.

cost less than £8 to £10.

“Forget Me Not.” That is the name of
the new attraction at the Theatre Royal. Gene-
vieve Ward, the American actress, plays in the
title role, and deserves the name, for none who
ever saw her in this very high-class comedy are
likely to forget her or her superb acting. Per-
haps you would like to know something about the
plot of the piece. Well, there isn’t much riot
about it. Stephanie, Marquise de Mohrivart (Miss
Ward), is the relict of a Parisian gambler, who was
Rilled in his own bed by a Corsican whom he had
ruined at the gaming table. Stephanie was also
marked for death, but the police rushed in just in
time to save her bacon from the dagger of the
assassin. She was a shrewd, unscrupulous woman,
with wonderful conversational powers, and drew
the rich young swells about her like flies around a
pot of honey. And she had a son, who. at toe age
of 22, married an English lady of position, named
Rose Varney. The young man died, for some
reason or other, a few months after his marriage,
and then his mother, the dashing Stephanie, set
about retrieving her fortune and social position.
She discovered that by the law cf France the mar-
riage was illegal (but would be made “ regular” if
she gave her consent to it before a year elapsed),
as toe bridegroom was not 25 years old on his
wedding day. With this knowledge in her posses-
sion she went to Rome, where the Varneys were
then sojourning, called upon them, told her story,
and compelled Alice Varney (Miss Maggie Knight)
not only to accept her as an Inmate of the house,
but to introduce her about as a very dear friend
of the family. At length, by the appearance of the
murderous Corsican in Rome, she is frightened into
leaving the Holy City, and that’s the last you see
of her until the next night, when she turns up
again, and goes through the same old game, just as
though nothing had happened the night before.

The play was written by F. C. Grove and
Herman Merivale, and, should it be the only one
they may ever write or have written, it will hand
them down to the posterity of the stage as
amongst the best playwrights of the century.
The character of Stephanie is a wonderfully
clever creation. She has all the audacity, all the wit,
all the beauty, and all the immoral courage that
has probably been compounded in one woman
since the time Old Nick himself wore petticoats
and used bis tall for an improver. She had the
beauty of Cleopatra, the audacity of Joan of Arc,
the moral stamina of Susana Wesley, and the wit
of Madame de Stael, as well as Margrave’s secret of
renewing his youth, all wrapped into one, and tied
with a bow-knot fore and aft.
• * •
The difference between physical and moral
courage is finely developed in this character.
Stephanie is so full of moral audacity that you
can’t help admiring her. She has the courage of
her opinions and wit, and uses them with “uch
effect on those about her that they don’t know
whether it is a hornet’s nest they are fooling with
or only the devil in disguise. She shows her intel-
lectual superiority over them in every utterance,
every act, and yet when physical danger threatens
she becomes a miserable, abject coward that you
can’t even pity. We have seen men of a similar
stamp in battle. They were always in the front,
where the bullets flew thickest, and were the first
to scale the bulwarks of the enemy. Many a time
have we lain behind a stump and seen them do
this. The next day, if some big bully threatened
to put a tin ear om them, they would grow white
in the face, and sneak out of the first loop-hole
that presented itself. In the very next engage-
ment you would see the soldier in the front again,
and the bully would be hunting us away from the
best-selected stump on the whole battle-field. We
once asi<ed an eminent General to explain
these phases of human nature to us, and he said:-
“ Moral courage isn’t afraid to die, and, therefore,
makes the best soldier : but it don t like to get its
eves blackened, and, therefore, runs from the
bully. The bully doesn’t care for a pounded
visage, and, therefore, courts a fisticuff ; but he
is afraid of death, and, consequently, when an en-
gagement is on, he hunts a stump. And that Is
the way it would be with Stephanie were she a
soldier. She would go right to the front with holy
enthusiasm, and plant her country s banner on
the bullet-SM ept rampants of the enemy ; and
then, if a mouse ran past her, she would hold up
both hands and scream like a Flute Indian at a
scaln dance. No-come to think of it—death was
exactly the thing Stephanie was afraid of, and she
cleared out of Rome t© avoid it. Somehow or
other we always get mixed when we go out be-
tween toe acts, and get to phllosophismg on
human nature. But we do know that there is
just as much difference in folks as there 18 In
butter, and on that ground, if on no other, the
character of Stephanie is as natural as the sun-
set glow on a toper’s nose.
* * •
Miss Ward’s acting has been praised so
much, and in so many different languages, that
there is nothing left for us to say about it. Her
voice is a little harsh at times, but she sings like
a nightingale, and, when she laughs, a miniature
cataract of melody leaps oyer her chin, and dies
away in distant ripples behind the further wings.
You hear the songs of birds mingled with the
murmurlngs of somo mountain stream ; or the
strains of an Eolian harp, hung where Heavens
sweetest winds may sweep its strings, to make a
tom-cat grin with envy because it can t sit up and
yowl like that. Genevieve reminds us forcibly of
Mary Anderson. Their acting in impassioned
parts is as much alike as two peas in a pod, but
Mary depends a great deal more on her statuesque-
ness of form, and makes you jealous of the man
who has to catch her when she faints.
* * *
Mr W H. Vernon takes the character of
Sir Horace Welby. It is an important r61e, and
yet it is so overshadowed by the brilliant concep-
tion ofStephanie, with which Sir Horace comes fn
constant contact, that you are apt to lose slght of
the finer points of acting in the minor part. Some-
how or other, knighthood is always associated
la our B ind with a tall, handsome, eagle-eyed,
commanding man—something us
that reason Sir Horace disappointed us justa Uttle.
He is scarcely as tall as Stephanie, and a1 .}u®
we had a suspicion that she could catch him by toe
hair and shake him until his teeth rattled. He
speaks his lines, however, with the skill of a finished
and experienced actor, and does remarkably well
under his heavy star-part handicap.

Mr. George I eitoh’s Prince Malleotti is as
good a piece of comedy acting as we have seen for
many a day. There is a subtleness in Mr. Leltch s
conception of this character that must be closely
looked for to be discovered and appreciated. It is
the class of comedy that depends more on the
polished rendition of the author s lines than in the
buffoonery thatimay usually be thrown with goed
effect between them. And yet we had expected to
see a Prince justa little more fondofd^ 8 P i^ h^ d
a little less yielding to the exactions of others.
However, that is the authors fault, not the
actor’s. *

Miss Maggie Knigbt, recently of the
Gaiety staff, has been specially engaged to play
the part of Alice Varney. Maggie is always get-
ting into trouble. We saw her shedding tears in
“Passion ” over the frailties of her father, in the
“ Squire ” she wept over Brio Thorndyke, t t
misfortunes he brought upon ber; in the Woman
la White” she went crazy and died, and, then
turned up in a mad-house, afterwards , and tot
“Money Spinner” she was swamped in more
misery than the little girl whose doll ahead tails
off and gets broken. Now, as Alice
system is wrenched to its foundations for fear that
the world may find out that there is a flaw in hr
sister’s marriage certificate, and that.she _herself
may become an illegitimate outcast. And she is al-
ways tu love. One time it is with one kind of a
character, and again with another. How it comes
that she can greet them, each and all, with the
same set of smiles, the same blushes and the same
tears, is one of those mysteries which are known
only to women who are well up in the business of
playing nine-pins with the hearts of men.

Miss Annie Taylor, as Mrs. Foley, was a
great favourite with the audience, but itstruckus
that she acted a good deal more like an old maid
than she did like a widow. A widow, you know,
is supposed to have some “ savee” about her when
she’s in the market, but Mrs. Foley went just the
wrong way about it to catch a second husband.
And then her voice had the sharp ring to it that
generally haunts the accents of the ancient spin-
ster. We don’t know why this should be so, unless
Mr. Foley might have died so soon after his mar-
riage that his wife hadn’t time to get her old-maid
voice thoroughly brokeninfor widowhood. ranoy
a widow showing jealousy because the man she
wants to captivate talks pleasantly to some other
woman. Oh, nol There isn’t a widow any where

present. It will run two weeks after this, and

procrastinate, or die. We are dying, ourselves—

The Federal Minstrels, at the Academy of
Music, continue to draw the largest crowds that
ever thronged into this bright little hall. We
went the other night again, and sat right behind
Genevieve Ward and Mr. Vernon. Those who
have only a partial knowledge of theatrical life
naturally Imagine that actors would take little
interest in performances of any kind, as they are
so much behind the scenes themselves, and know
how hollow are the speeches and the sentiments
expressed. But the fact is that good actors love
their profession as a rule, and on “ off ” nights you
will generally find them Improving the oppor-
tunity to attend a performance, if there is any on
! in town. Miss Ward attended the Gaiety the first
night she was in the city, and evinced the liveliest
interest in the acting of Grattan Biggs, Sam Boole,
and the others. But you should have seen her at
the Minstrels. The first time Sam Keenan showed
the chalk in his eyes, she nearly had to swallow her
cambric handkerchief to keep from screaming
right out; and when Horace Bent opened Are witn
some of his cayenne pepper jokes, we thought the
top of our head would come clean off watching
her. Carroll, too, was a puzzler, with his double
throat and duplex uvula.
♦ * *
Carroll is now thinking of playing two
engagements at once. He’s going to hire his
female throat out to sing babies to sleep in some
foundling hospital, while he sings baritone solos
with his male throat at the Minstrels. We don t
know whether Colonel Hisoocks has been con-
sulted in the matter or not, but we do know that
Carroll has the idea strongly impressed on his
mind. We know that it is strongly impressed, for
we put it teere ourselves. Thonextday we found
him at the Biverina singing a baritone solo in one
room, and a lullaby over Sam Keenan’s baby in
another. After a little more practice he hopes to
draw double salary, and if the Colonel objects he s
going to sell fish up one right-of-way, and green
iruit up another.

Alf. Moynham, the Girard, says that he is
not double-jointed. The London Medical Society
had him, under examination for about two hours
one time, and finally declared that his joints were
just like other people's, only Alf. had learned how
to use his better than they. We asked him the
other day what it was that ailed him, anyway, and
whether he lived on angle-worm soup, india-
rubber pie or the flexible statements of the Bum.
He replied that he was an ardent admirer of
corned beef and cabbage, and that his wonderful
suppleness was entirely due to constant practice
from the age of eight years up. We are only
telling this now because the attendance at the
Hospital has been falling off of late, and the daily
papers haven’t had anything, in lieu of accidents,
to write about. After this information gets
abroad, half the boys in Sydney will be hanging on
clothes-lines, getting into barrels, and trying to put
their feet wedged over their heads. It is an aw t u 1
thing for a boy to get stuck that way, as we know
by personal experience. We tried it once when we
were young, and our elder brother nearly warmod
the life out of us with a barrel stave before we
could get untied again. When we did get un-
tangled, however, you can bet we made it hotter
than Sam Hill for our mischievous relation. He
was always imposing on us. One time he wanted
to pull a tooth, and we volunteered to help ham.
While he was tying one end of a fish-line around
the tooth we were tying the other end to the
handle of a smoothing-iron. Then we threw the
Iron out at the door. The tooth followed the iron,
we followed the tooth, and our brother followed
us. About half-way up the hill he caught us and
sat down on us, and pounded us until we were so
black that a nigger wouldn’t have touched us for
fear of soiling his hands. Somebody was always
Imposing on us when we were little, and that is the
reason we treat everybody so fairly now that we vo
grown up. m ,
A very pleasant feature of the Federal s’
entertainment just now is the quartette composed
of Messrs. Braham. Beid, Porter, and Emery. We
had been wondering why the Colonel hadn t
brought that quartette out long ago, but on second
thoughts the reaEOn came to us. Hisoocks has found
out that the people are not going to let him go
away from Sydney for two or three months, and
so he has been saving up his novelties to have
something new in store for each succeeding week.
That is the way Christy has been doing in London
for about fourteen years, and Billy Emerson has
been doing in San Francisco for a couple of years
or so; and why shouldn’t Sydney support» stand-
ing Minstrel troupe? Oh, by the way, we had
almost forgotten to tell you that Col. Jack Haver-
ley, the great Minstrel manaaer of the States, has
gone to London and opened in Drury Lanelheatre
again with something over 100 performers, amongst
them being Billy Emerson, Charlie Bead, and a
number of other people who are well known in
Australia and America. Haverley s Hundred in-
vaded Drury Lane once before, if you remember,
and he got terribly frost-bitten for his daring
pluck. Haverley hasboen knocked to pieces more
times than any man in the show business, but he
always gets himself together again, and now owns
about a dozen of the largest theatres in the States.
Billy Emerson has sold nis San Francisco theatre,
and—but. there we go again: rambling, as usual,
and forgetting all about the subject in hand.
* * *
Next week, if you go to the Academy, you
will probably see the new farce, entitled “ Fun on
the Brighton, or a trip to Manly,” which Keenan
and Bent have been diligently engaged in getting
up for the last week or two. But we have stayed
long enough at the Minstrels for once, and are
going out for a fresh clove or two.
* * * *
We have often wondered if actors felt
themselves to be the characters they represent.
It is a matter of histrionic lore that John Wilkes
Booth, who shot President Lincoln, grew so in-
tensely in earnest in duel scenes that his opponent
had to use the utmost caution and skill to keep
awav from the vicious thrusts of the mad trage-
dian In fact, he wounded several actors with
whom he fenced. Pondering upon this thought,
the other night, we suddenly remembered that
Grattan Biggs had invited us to spend a while
between the acts in his dressing-room. We
dropped in on him just as he was making up for
Hans Seeilman, the German Glazier, in The Irish
Detective." The blue blouse didn’t seem to have
any effect when he put it on. but as he progressed
with the painting, and his nose grew red and his
face flushed, we could seeahunpy look come into
his eves. No sooner had the blonde wig been ad-
justed, and the moustache been fitted under his
nose than one hand reached convulsively forth
for a bottle of lager, and the other skirmished be-
tted the mirror for a link of Bologna sausage.
After he had eaten about four inches of the latter,
and drained the bottle to its dregs, he remarked :
“ Now, mien frent, I feel me besser, I mus go
oop.” After a while ho came down again, and
made-up as the aged negro clam-soup peddler.
How do you think the burnt-cork affected h.m.
Why, ho made a grab for a alice of kangaroo ham
with oae hand and a slice of watermelon with the
other. The darkies of America are especially
fond of watermelons, but it must have been toe
effect of the Australian climate that made Mr.
Riggs pine for kangaroo meat. Presently he bad
to make-up for Mrs. Muldoon, the fruit vendor.
Scarcely had he tied the strings of the bonnet
when he snatched a bottle of whisky from the
table, took a good stiff nobbier, and then cum bod
up on the back fence, and threw a stick oyer at
his neighbour’s chickens. Next we watched him
preparing to represent Ah Chat, the Chinese pie
vendor, and may we never tell a lie ag'ain if he
didn’t bite a chunk out of a roasted rat and swallo w
a cupful of cold tea. After that, we ceased to
wonder why Grattan played so naturally in the
different characters he had to assume.
* ♦ ♦
But we dropped into the Gaiety last Sa'ur-
day evening again, and found that “Shin Fane,
the well-known Irish drama, had taken the place
of the American production, " The Irish Detec-
tive.” The plot of “ Shin Fane ” Is as well-known
as we are, and twice as homely. In this piece, Mr.
Riggs assumes four different characters that
wouldn’t know each other if they met at a picnic.
There is Suil Gair, the Irish peasant; Con, the
simpleton; Mrs. Hanbury, a New York boarding-
house keeper; and Mr. Maguire, a ready-made
citizen. The audience did nothing but hold its
sides from the time the star went on until he went
off, for his characters were so irresistibly droll
that nobody could help laughing. The scene on
board the ship, where Mr. Riggs personates the
emigrant bound for America, was especially funny.
His family are about him in the forecastle, and he
gives the baby gruel with a spoon. Most of the
gruel, however, finds its way down the throat 01
the fond and self-indulgent parent. Presently a
suspicion of something wrong inside shows itself
in the expression of the emigrant’s face, and the
Gaiety seemed to rock and heave like a Now
Zealand coaster as he threw away the bowl and
made for the gunwale. We’ll wager a new hat
that Grattan hasn’t had such a ride since the time
some squatters up at Benalla persuaded him to
mount a buckjumper, assuring him, in the first
place, that it was a quiet and gentle lady s hack.
We shouldn’t speak lightly of this, however, tor
the amateur horseman was laid up for three
months as a result of the practical joke.
• • •
We found out, too, that Sam Poole has
more “act” in him than we had supposed. He
played Shaun Rhda, a tool of Martin .Doyle, the
returned convict, with so much naturalness that
you would have thought him born that way. Only
the night before we had seen him as Johnnie Lem-
mons, in the “ Irish Detective,” and the charac-
ters were so entirely different, both in make-up
and conception, that we searoly expected to see
the same actor in both. As Johnnie Lemmons
yon would know Sam Poole, but as Shaun Khda
he was as strange and pieturesque as a Maori hen
on a mud fence. Shaun is evidently Sam’s forte,
and he should stick to it like grim death to a dead
nigger, if he wants to scoop the Poole,
• • •
Michael Curran (Mr. Palmer), the well-to-
do farmer, is an up-hill part to play. Much
depends upon the character, and yet it is so
weakly drawn that it resembles our salary after
the landlady has trampled on it. However, Mr.
Palmer made the most of it, and as the ancestral
progenitor of Bl'en Curran (Miss Ethel Adele) he
was so benevolent-looking at times that we
wouldn’t mind having him for a father-in-law.
(No tinted notes, please; we are not in the market
this year, nor in shape for a duel either). D’Arcy
Stanfield’s Mackerel was fairly taken. After you
see D’Arcy in two or three roles and then meet
him face, to face in the street, you wonder where
in thunder he keeps all the foolishness that crops
out of him on the stage like pimples on a measle
patient. Really, on the street he is like other
folks, and you can tell he is a man ; but as be
appears on the siage he is a sort of left-handed
conundrum, and it would puzzle an antiquarian’s
brother-in-law to put the correct label on him.
* • •
Mollie Sullivan (Miss Maggie Oliver) the
Irish Diamond, was just to our liking. We always
were fond of “Irish Diamonds” when boiled in
the skin, or better still, when mashed in butterand
filled around a platter of Irish stew. But Maggie
isn’t exactly that kind of a diamond. She isn t
boiled nor mashed, that we know of, but she is as
pretty as any little pink-eye potatoe you ever saw,
and you Instinctively want to appropriate her
every time she comes near the foot-lights. Ah,
yes, and Miss Nita Steele played Betsy Koach, and
sang a captivating little ballad, for which she was
loudly applauded. Miss Steele is a stranger to
Sydney play-goers, but since her d<5but at the
Gaiety she has been steadily increasing in favour,
and as she really has some ability, as well as a fair
share of prettiness, we hope to see her succeed.
• • •
Mr. Appleton’s Pierce Curran is not the
worst thing we have seen him do. We honestly
believe that Mr. Appleton is learning to act a little,
and, if he would only put his voice under culture
at the hands of a good voice-builder he might yet
acquire a distinct articulation. He has a way of
gasping, when drawing in his breath to begin al-
most every sentence, that is painfully monotonous
at times. We don't believe that ho has ever
noticed this himself, and as it is one of those
“stage vices” that every actor should avoid,we
feel like pointing it out to him. It is said
that “ whom the gods love, die young.”
Mr. Appleton is an exception to this rule.
The gods, that is the gallery gods, seem to
love him, and they give him a “reception ” every
evening. We don’t like to bo hard on a man, nor
to blight aspiring genius in the bud, but it is only
by drawing attention to these little eccentricities
I that the public ever learned what an astute and
discerning critic we are. Moreover, it they
escaped unnoticed, the stage would soon be over-
run by a lot of amateurs that never could hope to
return a proper equivalent for the public’s money.
We don’t mean to say that Mr. Appleton Is an
amateur, for he is not. He is a notch or two above
that, certainly, but still there is room for improve-
ment, both in his voice and manner that nothing
but diligent and persistent study can effectually
accomplish.

On Wednesday night the programme at
the Gaiety was changed again to the " Shaugraun,”
with Mr. Riggs in the title role, but we didn’t have
time to attend. It is the bill for the remainder of
the present week, Mr. Riggs taking a benefit on
Friday evening. Next Monday evening “ Fun on
the Bristol” goes on at the Gaiety, with Mr.
Sheridan as the bright particular star. In the
meantime we are going out with Coleman to get
some “three-star’* hot, as it is so confoundedly
cold we have worn our molars all away chewing
on frozen cocktails.

The smoke nights of the Sydney Lieder-
tafel last week were as great crammers as Henni-
ker Heaton’s romance of the secret despatches
which he did not carry at the risk of his life. If
»ny one were to slander the singing members of the
Liedertafel to us, we shouldn t defend them. They
are quite capable of taking their own parts. We
don’t know which of their songs we liked best,
but we think-this is our sly way of putting It—
we liked the last one best. There was one false
note during the evening. The clarionet-player
sent It, and it was to the effect that he couldn't
come. A member of committee communicated
the lie to the audience—some of whom had the
happy inspiration of applauding the announce-
ment, and then blushing and pretending they had
only been trying to crush a black-beetle with their
boots. By and bye, the man with the cold turned
up. We don’t know how he managed it, but we
suspect an habitual drunkard must have passed
hla window and thawed him out with the glowing
tip of his—the habitual’s—nose. Anyway, he
came, and smiled at the audience as cheerfully

There comes a tale from the Western lands,
and it bears the stamp of truth In Job-type letters
on it. VoiU! A certain meenister was invited to
fill a vacant pulpit, and to preach a sample sermon
In anticipation of a rousing “ call.” He put up at
th® house of one of the leading lights of his
church, and as the worthy pair sat and sipped their
gingerbeer-wlth-a-dark-bottom, the host hoped
the new divine would avoid saying anything in his
sermon that would offend the Salvation Army
votaries, as there were many in the town who
really hollered in their tambourine tomfoolery.
Walking down the street soon after this, the parson
met another pillar of the church, who earnestly
implored him not to be rough on the Papists, as
the Irish element predominated in that district,
and had great Influence with the local member.
A little further along, another elder, who was
a publican as well, button-holed his reverence
and observed! “ ’Tween ourselves, now, I wouldn’t
drop on to the moderate drinkers too sultry—in
fact, I wouldn’t touch them at all. Y’ see, Dr
Barry’s with them; an’, besides, they’re not half
bad fellows, either. Come in t’ th’ back parlour
and try my new teetotal mixture.” Sunday
arrived, and the minister was about to enter the
pulpit when one of the deacons whispered, “Beg
pardon, Sir, but, for heaven’s sake, don’t say any-
thing against the land lotteries. Our Mayor is
deeply interested, an’ that’s ’im there—th’ stout,
red-nosed old man in th’ first pew, sir.” “ Look
here, my friend,” said the perplexed preacher,
“What on earth shall I preach about?” “Well,
lemme see, now,” replied the deacon, as he stroked
his chin; “ oh—ah-yes-look here (excitedly), give
It t’ th’ God-forsaken Jews—rub it into them hot;
giv’ ’em a real monkey and parrot ole time of it,
sir—they haven’t got a dam—beg pardon—not a
single friend in town, sir 1”

about it, let us try to approach the subject with
some circumspection—just to show our astuteness
like. Well, no names are to hand in the telegram
relating to this—er—what shall we say—this, yes
this affair. Consequently, if it should turn out
that the miner, who is an old man, knocked a
preacher through a door, the question arises
straight up on its very hindest legs, whether the
miner drove him through with dynamite, or a
cheap cartridge with a wet fizzling fuse, or
whether he got hojd of one of the preacher's most
eloquent sermons, held him back against the door,
and read it through from where Moses and Co.
rolled up their breeches to the knee and
waded off with the Egyptian’s Walthams, and
Oriental nose-rings, down to the period when
the same legislator mounted Mount Nebo, and, be-
holding the fertile valleys of Palestine, took pos-
session of it in virtue of a title endorsed by one
Abraham, who had some sort of a claim under an
old act. Whatever was the manner of this outra—
no, this dastar—no, this, er—in fact, it is evident
from the Evening News ana the Herald that a
theologian is more than suspected of having
suffered some slight inconvenience by having
passed through a door with a degree of speed that
might, in an unregenerate man, be regarded, as,
well, what shall we say ?—regarded as—[No. The

Some short time ago there was an outcry
raised about rabbits being scalped and turned
loose again, but it was partially discredited at the
time. That such a practice does exist is, however,
proved, by the fact that an aged, but otherwise
respectable, old party named Goobroy, from the
Billabong, has just written to say that as he was
out looking for clean-skinned calves the other day
he saw a rabbit trip up whilst running through the
scrub, and that the top of its head fell down a
hole and was lost. Upon going over he found the
rabbit—a full-grown doe—had had all the upper
storey of its skull sawed off, and something else
had then been glued on to keep the rain from the
animal’s brain pan. Unfortunately, however, the
doe died before old Goobrey could find the missing
cover. Similar incidents are recorded from
several portions of the Riverlna district, where, it
is said, artificial crowns are made out of greenhide
by the bushel, and fastened on to the scalped
rabbits by means of patent cement and sealing,
wax. This would be a wholesome and profitable
recreation for the natives up there, and would
occasion much innocent amusement amongst the
bob-tailed bunnies, also, were the latter not un-
happily prej udiced. Rabbits are very conservative
in their ways, and have a deep-rooted objection to
go scooting around with the butt-end of a calf’s
tail jabbed on their heads for a night-cap.

Some fellow on the Rum has been inter-
viewing Genevieve Ward, at Petty’s Hotel, and
the gifted Jane—her proper name, we know, is
Jane—loaded up the reporter to the muzzle with
information, and he fires off the whole thing in the
columns of ihe Rum aforesaid. We learn that
Miss Ward has a dog, and that she has lost all her
money In the Oriental Bank. Well, during the
last few days we have met 17,000 people we know,
and they all seem to be in the same predicament.
Still, for all that, there seems to be no diminution
of the amber beads In their moustaches; and, If
anything, since the failure, level boot-heels appear
rather to have increased. We have lost a few
thousands ourselves; but our name Is still (appar-
ently) good at the fish-shop, and we haven’t as yet
given a definite answer to a deputation professing
to organize a benefit. We don’t think we will take
it, anyhow—for there are so many pros, who seem
to have lost much more than we have I Besides*
we don’t arrogate to ourselves any prescriptive
right to monopolise the monkey-show and the cat"
circus even for on® consecutive night.

At the funeral of the late John Harris, of
Parramatta, the chief mourners were his two
little orphans, who each carried a cross of white
flowers. A local poet or poetess was so touched at
the spectacle, that he or she dropped into verse
which, for Della-Crusean limpidity of pure bathos,
bangs Banagher. Having made the poor little
kids ask, “ How can we go back to the desolate
home ?” h® or she makes answer to them in this
wise:—
“ Yes, babies, return, and think of the flowers
Laid in that ‘ vault,’ in sorrow’s sad hours;
They rebelled not, nor wept, when cut from the
‘stem,’
But submitted in meekness—go imitate them.”
For unadulterated Pecksniflian bosh, surely this
takes the cake. Why, it is almost SJadenic in its
pointless insipidity. The subject was susceptible
of poetic treatment, but then it wanted one with
some measure of poetic gift. Unfortunately, it
fell into the hands of one to whom poetry is an
unknown quantity. Our advice to him or her is—
“ Go, look at the local culturist’s crops,
Nary pumpkin of which into poetry drops;
They have ne’er sent to Fekguson lyrical gem,
But are stupid in prose—oh, pray, imitate them.”
The indignation of hon. members respect*
ing the young schoolmaster who “gotround” a
girl and subsequently married her, is calculated to
Impress upon those that are aware of the elevated
social proclivities of hon. members very consider-
ably. The delinquent ought, cry many of our
legislators, to be dismissed. Now, listen I—
O rulers so immaculate I
Each one of vice a scorner ;
Say, how many of you, of late,
Have “ mouched ” at that dark corner 7—
No harm, of course—the old, old song—
“ To send a teacher,” say, “ along.”
Beneath the shadow of that pile
We have seen you in droves, sirs ;
Oft waiting too, a long, long while.
Before you copped your loves, sirs I
But yet the boy who had the whim|
To wed—why, what’s too bad for him ?
AN ANTI-TEETOTAL HYMN.
Let us now in song extol
Every kind of gen’rous liquor—
Sing the praise of alcohol
Till the toper’s pulse beats quicker ;
Tell of all the sweet delight
Yielded by a deep potation—
How it lends a rosy light
To our nose and conversation.
Every Joy that man can know
Magnifies with wine’s assistance ;
When the port and sherry flow
Troubles vanish to a distance :
Never do our fancies float
To the fairy regions nearer,
Than when pouring down our throat
Half a pint of old madeira.
IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE LIBERALS MIGHT BE BEAT AT THE OPERA HOUSE ON SUNDAYS, BY SOMEWHAT ENLIVENING THE ORTHODOX SERVICES WITH

As the rum or whisky steals
To our brain in fragrant vapours,
Then it is.« M ow feels
In the cue for cutting capers ;
Men, when drunk, see certain sights
Never seen by mortals saner—
Visions haunt our beds o’nlghts
That never visit the abstainer.
After twelve or thirteen beers,
Just as sleep comes creeping o’er us,
Dead tea-totallers quit their biers,
Marching in review before us ;
Awe-struck, we behold them there—
Temperance ghosts and anti-smokers—
Warning us to never “ swear
Off,” like they did (poor old jokers 1),
[And we don’t.]


Society (London), like the offensively
snobbish rag It is, says:—“When the remains of
the young Duke of Albany were carried in solemn
procession through the streets of Windsor, it was
only here and there that a head was bared. As
Windsor is a Conservative and loyal borough, we
are considerably surprised at this exhibition of
bad taste. Au contraire, the guests invited from
London travelled bareheaded, and arrived so at
Windsor Station.” Talk about the knee-plush-
ultra of loyalty, what do you think of these syco-
phantic guests from London going in bald-headed
for influenza, out of respect to Albany’s memory.
Somehow, we don’t think that blessed memory hap
much to do with it. The Windsor folks, who had
nothing to gain by exposing themselves to the
risk of a cold, nor to lose by remaining tiled,
acted like sensible fellows; au contraire, the in-
vited guests, with whom sycophancy means pick-
i°gs. considered it biz. to run the risk of a cold in
the head. If it were the mode for a score or so
of / oun ? people of fashion to be burled alive with
& dead Royal Highness, families sufflcently snob-
bish to supply the victims, would be found in
galore. Scrape any of those people who trave led
bare-headed from London to Windsor, and be-
neath their professed Christianity and boasted
civilisation, you would find either the servile
heart of a votary or the selfish mind of a hiero-
phant of Mumbo Jumbo.
It was only a few short months ago that
soul was stirred when we read in the Noozk
that thrilling narrative of perils on the deep by
J. Henniker Heaton. In welrldly descriptive lan-
guage that gifted writer told how the terrific
oyclone lashed the ocean into wild fury; how the
wild wind whistled Jigs through the ratlines and
rl ffgings and things of the Messagerles steamer;
and how the seething waves threatened to enguli
the almost doomed ship and its living freight. In
fact, his word picture was go realist!* that our
mental vision could easily discern one manly form
on the deck of the vessel—an intrepid and fearless
sea-dog, who paced the planks with a firm step, and
calmly surveyed the raging elements, whilst his
fellow passengers, with blanched cheeks and
terror-stricken hearts, were lying under battened
hatches, expecting every minute to bo their next.
Need we say that this living type of t.he hardy
Norseman was none other than our own Henniker ?
(Scarcely.—Ed. B,] And, furthermore, were we
not bubbling over with enthusiasm when we learnt
that he imperilled his life and liberty in the cause
of his country, by running the blockade, so to
speak, with those famous despatches, and deliver-
ing them safely to the British Government, and
thereby constituting himself the saviour or the
nation. Not only did he do all this, but no grasped
his graphic pen and let an expectant world know
what manner of men his ship-mates were. We have
a vivid recollection of how the remaining hairs on
our venerable head stood ereot as we read the
terrible story of that cannibalistic young hero
who murdered his wife’s paramour, fried the liver
of the corpse, served it up on the half shell, com-
pelled his better half to banquet on the delicate
dish, and then artistically slit her jugular. Was it
any wonder, then, that we almost fell down and
worshipped this marvellous man, whose intrepi-
dity was only equalled br his genius as a story-
tell we mean a descriptive writer ? But. Just as
we were about to dip our pen in violet ink and
write his praises in blank verse. Captain Boyle, of
H.M.8. Tourmaline, clips in and knocks all the
stuffing out of the secret despatches in one round.
Here was a crusher, indeed; but It was followed
by another “belt” that completely floored our
Henniker. The “ Vagabond ” now openly charges
Mr. Heaton with deliberate plagiarism In the
matter of the pleasant cannibalistic anecdote, and
states that the yarn was spun by himself in a
Sydney paper ever so many years ago. If this
kind of thing goes on, we shall begin to grow
sceptical. We may, under mild pressure, be made
to oelleve that Hennlker’s services to his Queen
and country were not so valuable as the Nooze
would suggest; but, then, to think of him as being
guilty of literary (?) piracy—perish the thought!
Isn’t it just about time we gave the Duke
of Albany a rest? When alive, he was generally
as quiet as a knot on a log, and the bulk of tb’e
people took no interest in his doings. Now that
ne is dead, however, it is simply impossible to split
a homo exchange that doesn’t positively reek with
the Buke of Albany. All he did, and ail he didn’t;
all he said, and all he left unsaid, are duly chroni-
cled in a style calculated to make every reasonable
man mad. Here, for instance, is the London
Lickspittle and General Groveller, which
says:—“The late Prince Leopold, although not a
sporting man—he being too deiicete to engage in
the rougher pastimes—was very fond of watching
thoraces at Sandown Park. His Royal Highness
was a member of the Jockey club, but aid not
often attend the meetings.” By heavensi we’ve
caught the mania now ourselves. We, tco, will
recount his deeds and grovel, so here goes: “It is
not generally known that Prince Leopold was an
ardent lover of the chase, but, as the joggedly-
Joggedly action of a horse used to jolt his ‘innards,’
he was eompelled to sit on a rail and chew dande-
lion lozenges while the hunters and dogs ran
past.” Again: “ The Buke of Albany was passion-
ately fond of fishing, and used to be frequently
wheeled down to a little goose-pond in the park,
where he would sit for hours bobbing for eels
with a bit of fried beet on a bent pin. Occa-
sionally, John Brown used to dive down
and fasten a sardine on the hook, upon which
His Koyal Highness used to gleefully haul it
up and declare that angling was a sport
fit for the immortal gods themselves.” Once
more : “ Football will sustain a heavy loss in the
death of our beloved Prince. Not that he ever
even saw a game played in his life, but he used to
send Jars of arnica, and barrow-loads of splints to
the nearest hospital, whenever a friendly game
was played.” Still another: “ The late Prince
Leopold had all that wild, dare-devil love of the
sea, which was the chief characteristic of the old
Vikings, whose blood evidently coursed through
his regal veins. As he usually suffered very much
from the “Ob, Mys” and the Wha-hooo-ooons
whenever he was forced to skim the waves, he
generally contented himself by sitting on a
bathing-house step and reading Captain Marryat s
thrilling sea stories.” Striking off on a job lot of
otner remarkable traits in the Buke of Albany’s
character, we may also add that His Royal High-
ness translated the Bible into Chinese, and made
several valuable improvements on tne original
story. He was also the author of a set of copy
books, and when only three years of age could
read the inscriptions on Babylonian bricks as well
as he could when he was three-md-twenty. He
was the Inventor of the steam engine, the green
potato bug, and the yellow janders. He discovered
America 12 months before Kit Columbus was l orn;
he fought with Julius Caesar at Vinegar Hill and
Fontenoy ; he was the first Mormon elder that
ever married into a red-haired woman’s family; he
knocked Goliath out in three rounds, and then out
off his leg and threw it down a well. Ho was tne
co-respondent in the case of Potiphar v. Potlphar;
he shod Balaam’s ass on a Sunday, and was changed
into a pillarof Epsom salts oy way of punishment;
ho was the mother of the Gracchi; and he stole
Buchanan’s boots, fixed them up an wtieeis, and
then palmed them off on Minister Wright as a new
style of tramcars. He was the Man “in ihe Iron
Mask, and subsequently became the Siamese
Twins, and Margaret Catchpole He iTttilt the
Central Police Court and the Tower of Babel. He
made the world; and, mjiue, he said, did, thought,
and planned out everything that has ever hap-
pened. And now, having paid this slight tribute
to his memory, we trust all other Journals will let
up on His Kojal Highness for at least another
week. We can stand a Book for breakfast, and we
might even try another cut for dinner; but when
it comes to hashing the balance up for tea, and
then grilling the bones up for supper, we object,
and maniacally yell: “ Not any more Book on our
plate to-nignt, tnank you.”

as If he didn’t know they had wanted to
kill him only about ten miuutes before. -Ana
when he had doue smiling, he began coughing
through his instrument in a manner which would
have done no discredit to the heavenly choir dur-
ing a celestial influenza epidemic. During the
disturbance which followed, we ascertained tbat
the gifted performer’s name is Mr. Kore. Ihe
audience were almost unanimous in clamounuu
for someone to “hang Kore.” We think colds
must be conducive to effrontery, and infectious at
that; for. instead ef a plcketlt rom the committee
coming forward and respectfully hanging Kore,
that hardened offender trotted out and sarcasti-
cally bowed his acknowledgments. The next item
in the performance, which “took well and gave
pleasure to all,” was Herr Vogrich’s Grsaoo-
Koman wrestle with the piano-stool. Ihe talented
performer commenced the struggle by getting a
neck hold of the stool, and deliberately sitting
down upon it. Without any apparent effort, the
Stool promptly heaved him off, and stood looking
at him with a composed but defiant expression.
The composer dashed upon it again, and, getting a
grip, twisted its head round till its eyes stuck out,
and its squeals and laboured breathing could be
heard in the remotest part of the hall, then
Vogrich sat down upon it again, and an ex-
pression of pain and uncertainty settled up-
on his features. The stool, concentrating its
strength for a grand effort, bucked, and lifted
its antagonist clean off his feet. Several bouts
rapidly succeeded, with the same results. Ihe
stool seemed as fresh as when it started, while
Vogrich was evidently getting pumped. Suddenly
he made a supreme effort, sectlred R tremendous
hold around the waist of the stool, and, wrenching
it from its footing, lifted it high in air, and
dashed It behind him, whereupon its backers threw
up the sponge, and passed'in a chair for him to
worry. This was a very fine performance m the
leg-ato style, and was followed by a rally with the
pianoforte, in which Vogrich had all the best of it,
getting in his left with immense effect, and making
the instrument groan. The history of Mr. Halie-
well’s misfortunes In the Desert was another item
in the programme which afforded much enjoy-
ment. The worse his sufferings, the better the
audience seemed to like it, and there was great
enthusiasm when he intimated that a detachment
of vultures were about to have him for ih°®h.
He concluded with the well-known theme, |he
Camels are coming,” and escaped with his Rfe.
The remainder of the Circus was lost upon us. »s a
small dude took our seat, and we had to take a
place behind him, where our view of the stage was
entirely shut out by the meerschaum which had
brought him to the concert.

We went out to Botany last Sunday after-
noon to see what sort of an entertainment Mr. F.
Smith was offering to the public in the way of
Sunday concerts, and we were agreeably surprised.
An excellent orchestra, under the directorship of
Mr. Charles Austin, discoursed sweet music, which
floated out between the bents of the pavilion and
made the Muscovy ducks in the pond at the rear
turn their heads on one side and look at the sun.
Mr. J. Gordon was the first singer to appear on the
stage. He sang a solo called *• The Vidette ” away
down in his boots somewhere, and made the bass
cornet hide its head under a kettle for shame at its
insignificance. Then Miss Alice Johns came forth
and sang “It was a Dream ” in such a pretty go-as-
you-please style that the birds were fairly charmed
out of the bushes and swarmed down to pick up
the notes that fell all about the grounds like sugary
crumbs from a wedding breakfast. And then
Percy Shannon. T. H. Rainford, Signor Gustavo
Bellini, and Miss Reives came afterwards, and
warbled away until we went to sleep, because the
bar was closed with a sergeant of police on duty in
front. During part of the concert we took a stroll
through the beautiful gardens attached to the
pavilion, and felt our bachelor loneliness more
deeply than ever as we passed this little arbour and
that, and saw young gallants whispering the “oft-
told tale” into the ears ot listening maids. The
thought then struck us that if we were in love
with a girl, and were afraid to tell her so, we should
take her up to Botany some Sunday, and go on a
stroll through those gardens. With the orchestra
playing in the distance, and the voices of the
singers floating down to us like the soughing of a
summer wind through groves of orange and pome-
granate, we could muster up courage enough to
make a start in the right direction if our tongue
hasn’t altogether forgotten ail the cunning of by-
gone years. The crowd, which mostly came in
buggies and carriages, numbered about 10C0, and
was very orderly and quiet. Botany isn’t half a
bad place to spend a Sunday afternoon, you may
depend upon it.

The series of lectures given by Mrs. Dr.
Potts, at the Opera House, have during last week
and up to Wednesday night of the present week
been liberally patronised by all classes of the com-
munity. The talented lady has thrown out many
valuable hints, especially to the ladies; and her
pleasing style of speaking has been greatlj en-
joyed. We know that the ladies have received
some valuable hints from Mrs. Potts, because we
asked several who had been to hear her what they
had learned, and they refused to tell. That’s the
way with a woman. When she gets hold of any-
thing good—really good, and that a man would
en j 0 y_ 8 he won’t tell him a word about it. If it
were something bad—something he really wouldn’t
want to hear—you can lay odds that she never
would rest until she had told him all about it.
Anyway, we are satisfied that the lectures were
good, for we don’t believe that a man like Alec
Waugh would be found dead along in advance of
anything that wasn’t worth the public’s money, or
wouldn’t draw it, or something.

M’Lean’s Operatic Company, including Misses
Horan and Pox, and Messrs. Walton and James,

district The Stanley Juvenile Onera Company
were at Newcastle, recently, some of them wheezy
with colds. If there is anything that is calculated
to soothe the playgoer’s soul into restful repose, it
is a Juvenile Opera Company with a bad cold. The

Dunning Opera Company in Melbourne for rent,

business will stand over for a month—The Mon-
tague-Turner Opera Company have been singing
to holiday houses at Albury. They sang it. the
Mechanics’ Institute Hall, and the Border Post
says that the audience remained in the Hall simply
on suflrance. This was not owing to the singing,
however, but to the coldness of the place, the
acoustic defects, and a lot of other things. As the
hall is a new one, the local architect will probably
call the editor of the Border Post out, and put a
Mansard roof over his left eye —Chlarini’s Royal
Italian Circus and Menagerie is still at Adelaide,
and is having a most successful season.... Ben-
hamo’s Engllsn Circus is also in Adelaide gather-

will be few coppers dropped in the Sunday School
plate at Adelaide for some time to come, if the
youngster of to-day is anything like the young-
ster of twenty years ago — King's Mammoth

Dramatic Company are in Melbourne after a suc-
cessful up-country trip with Miss Lillian Russell
as "Little Jo.” Professor Baldwin has been de-
luding the people of Townsville. He will be in
Sydney before long to renew old acquaintances
and revive their “spirits.” — Mr. George Leitch
Walker, now playing with Genevieve Ward at the
Theatre Royal, is the author of “ Coming Home, or
Sichors to Grind.” Before we knew who the
author of this piece was, we thought he ought to
write another one and then die. Come to think
of it, we are pretty much of the same opinion still.
The Blayney Advocate seems annoyed
because the Bathurst Times people—Dowse and
Macdougal—have started a paper called the Blay-
ney Argus. D. and M., who, it seems, run that
vivacious organ, the Bathurst Times, announce
that in their new venture they have “ high alms
independent of pecuniary gaino.” The Advocate
denounces this as “ bunkum,” and proudly ex-
claims—“ We have helped to make Blayney what
it is.” We thoroughly believe this; and therefore
we have too much delicacy to state that we have
been several times up in search of Blayney, but
have never been able to find itl Carcoar Mary,
by the way, has a sub-title as the Blayney some-
thing ; and we are anxious to hear what she has to
say about the matter. We have an idea, though,
that the Advocate boys won’t tackle Mary. They
know how we writhed when we felt the weight of
her editorial foot—we mean the castigation of her
illy hand.
This is, of course, another gem coruscating
in the crown of Alfred the Great. Read it: —“ He
ought to have remembered how like it is to Bul-
lamy’s (sic) introduction of Mr. Montague Tegg
(sic), * By your leave; by your leave there I Room
for the chairman of the board. By your leave.’ ”
it is supposed to be a synonym for that little
judicial creature in Adelaide who ordered the Court
stand up and salute the Chief Justice. Unfortun-
ately for Alfred and his strain after the euphemis-
tic, there was no “ Bullamy ” in the “ Anglo-Ben-
galee,” and equally there was no “ Mr. Montague
Tegg.” We are sorry to have to say this, because
we have respected Alfred ever since we last saw
him at lunch I A man who has his fowl and mush-
rooms hoisted up in a soup-tur Well, there!
But, for all that, there is no “ Bullamy,” and there
is no “ Montague Tegg,” either: unless Alfred—
which wouldn’t surprise us—has written a “ Martin
Chuzzlewit” of his own
One of the meu who had the Tamworth
News has taken a pub. up there. He says the
people will invariably swallow what he edits now,
but formerly they were inclined to be sceptical.
The News is now owned by Jews, and also managed
by a prominent descendant of the seven tribes of
Judah. He is at issue—his name is Joseph—with the
other editor, whose name Is Hooke. The latter has
put in the window of his bookshop a frame con-
taining specimens of the writing of all the Hooke
family, and also a fac-simlle of Joseph’s alleged
letter to the editor of this journal, a sample of ms
illustrious pothooks also appearing. This seems
to interest the Tamworth people a good deal-a
circumstance which demonstrates, perhaps, that
they are easily interested. The plant of the other
paper—the Independent— is “ mouldering in its
grave,” and things journalistic up Tamworth way
are not effusively gay. About the most exciting
place we know for a paper is Singleton. The
editor there is a charming fellow ; but ho ad-
mitted, in confidence to us, that if he were sot
stirred up by a stipendiary boy occasionally, he
would assuredly get mouldy.
Up in Maitland, the other Sunday, a ceiv
taln Wesleyan minister expressed the hope that
the contribution, which was to be for missionary
purposes, would be particularly liberal. He hoped*
in fact, that everyone present would put the
largest coin they had on them in the box. The
Wal Times says that immediately a great many
people began feeling for their pennies. We didn’t
know before that so many Scotch people were in
the habit of attending the Wesleyan Church, and
are inclined to take tho Times’ statement for sar-
c ism. We do remember, however, once hearing a
conversation between an Irishman and a Scotch-
man. They were “barneying” each other, as a
matter of course, when finally tho Irishman said:
“ It’s a dlvll av a pity, anyway, that the farthin’ is
no longer a circulating coin av the realm.” “ Why
is it a pity ?’ enquired the Scot. “ Share, now that
it s no longer circulatin’, the Scotch haven’t any-
thing to put on tho plate av a Sunday mornln’.”
Mr. Summers, inspector of singing masters
in Victoria, has been drawn into a controversy
about musical criticism, and has pleaded for the
right of professional men to write criticisms for
the newspapers when he himself no longer has to
compete with his brethren. “ It is agreed by all,”
says tho Melbourne letter to the Brisbane
Courier, “ that a capable amatour is the best sort
of critic to have.” With this we agree; for, of all
the men in the world, the musical man Is the most
touchy when it comes to criticism. Everybody
read how the Age critic, Moule, got thrashed for
saying that Signor What's-his-name’s Mass was
poor. Or, was it the other man who got thrashed ?
It’s tho same thing, for both were professional
musicians. Anyhow, a “ capable ” amateur is cer-
tainly the most reliable man, but how many ama-
teurs are capable? We have known men, who
have no more ear than a goat, criticise Ketten,
and Madame Goddard, and fill long columns with
their rot. And we have seen a similar thing
attempted about pictures by men who cannot dis-
tinguish between green and blue. Let us have
capable amateurs, by all means, but let them he
capable.

The Herald youth, alludes,"re the initial

Here is a legal point, which the lover of

much as running a chicken hazard.
A Mrs. Sturgess, in Melbourne, has recently
palmed off a strange kid on her hub. After some

as we can gather, upon scientific grounds. Huxley

Because we will have the most stirring
topics of the day In our columns, and because we
have narrowly escaped colonial disruption through

not keep a vigilant eye on new developments in
that seditious province. Says the Star, cautiously:
“ Rumour says that shortly a police station is to be

A foolish, Goulburnite objects to
bo-irded-ouc children being admitted to the public
schools, on the ground that most of them are the
progeny of very depraved parents. Now, the
felluw who entertains such a notion as that, is the
very one who, the opportunity being afforded him,
would kootoo to a royal bastard. Wo wonder if
he would go the length of advocating the removal
from high place—from the Supreme Court Bench,
from the Legislative Council, from the Commis-
sion of the Peace, etc.—of that tidy long list of
men who are notoriously the progeny of very de-
praved parents.
The Corporation of St. Peter’s (Adelaide
S.A.), in the prosecution of a crusade against
brothels, discovered that a certain demi-mondalne
establishment, which was conducted on a very
grand scale, was regularly frequented by pro-

do ? Expose the prominent citizens or prosecute
the keeper of the house they froq uented ? Not so;
Simply asked them to shift the scene of their im-

When an Evening News man heard that
in New Zealand seven people had been poisoned by
whisky, he sm.led sardonically. He went round to
Ihinah's, and told Deeble he didn’t believe it. He
pointed out that the rumour was a libel on a whole-
some spirit, and suggested that he should refute It
first by practical experience, and next through the
medium of his valuable columns. Deeble sa’d he
would consult Punch; and, probably, when their
joint decision Is known, we shall publish a second
edition. The chief suspense, however, neither is
with us nor our readers. It is centred, of course,
in the man who Is anxious to make the experi-
ment.
It is satisfactory to learn that the detec-

No passenger, we understand, brought ashore a
package even labelled “ uitro-glycerine, with

however ; so revelations of a startling character
may shortly be expected. It took about 5000
police to catch three dynamiters at home; but we
have no doubt our little lot here will show a better
record. They have got p'enty of confidence, any-
how. And they look pretty standing outside the
theatre.
When Dean Faithful heard Genevieve
Ward In “ Forget Me Not,” he said to her, You

blood-thirsty who had put a lump of orange-
peel In his milk-jug, the Dean would perhaps have

The Liberal congratulates Mr. Cyril Havi
land that his efforts In the direction of the abolition
of barmaids are already bearing fruit, even though
in another colony. The little touch of mutual
admiration ” is a clear case of shouting before
being out of the wood. Barmaids are not yet
abolished. The Melbourne Royal Commission on
Employes in Shops, who suggest their abolition,
never even heard of Cyril Haviland. To credit
him, therefore, with effecting what hasn t yet been
effected, and with having exerted influence on
people who have never so much as heard of either
him or his opinions, is (not to put too tine a point
of it) a whole lot too thin. Cyril is an authority on

winds up, after giving ade

addition to the above Mr
Edwards has several medals
and carries the finest assorted
wardrobe of any pedestrian
in the country. He has al

Giddy Edwards! He has evi-

Ladies proverbially go
by contraries, and the Manly
fair ones were no exception
to the rule when they decided
the Fairllght cricket match,
which eventuated Inst Satur-
day, should be held during
the “ Off ” season. Teams
were picked consisting of
he’s and she’s mixed up pro-
miscuous like, the sterner sex
agieeing to bar left-handed
only. The game progressed
pretty equally until one
gentleman started to bat
right-handed, when he was
at once ordered to change.
This he did; but as he hap-
pened to be left-handed, he
didn’t lose much by the
change, as he followed the
suit of the Permanent Artil-
lery, and bombarded the
Quarantine Station with the
first ball he received. The
hit fairly galvanised the op-
posing side, and the fair part
of it—If we were ungahant
we might say unfair—insisted
on the much-talked of cricket
match being called a draw.
Thus ended the match of the
Manly eeason, but not the
festivities, which were kept
up till chanticleer—but, we

Dr. Carver recently wagered he could
shoot 1000 bats in 80 minutes; and more than ac-
complished the task by dropping 1003in71 minutes.
The bats were thrown into the air two at a time by
a negro attendant, the doctor standing at a dis-
tance of eighteen yards. He used two guns, in-
cluding a favourite weapon, which he calls the
•’Old Widow,”
A writer from Rockhampton suggests that
Tom White, who is stated to be somewhere out
Port Douglas way, should be retained as coach for
the local rowing clubs. White was certainly a
good man in his day, and made his mark in the
archives of English aquatics. Besides winning
Doggetfs coat and badge, he formed one of the
champion four at the Tnames National Regatta, in
1858. In ’59 he was beaten on the Tyne, by
Robert Chambers.
We have received a copy of the “ English,
American, and Australian Sporting Calendar,”
edited by James B, Tonkin, of Bathurst. Mr,
Tonkin touches on every class of sport from horse-
racing to cocking and ratting, and gives tables of
records which cannot but prove of interest to
sporting men of every description. That th®
records are well up to date is proved by the fact
that the colonial pugilistic list winds up with the
recent, unfortunate affair between Lawson and
Agar.

The return match between the New Zea"
land and New South Wales footballers, played on
the Association Ground on Saturday last, resulted
m another easy win for the visitors. The Sydney
men made a fair show up to half-time, but after
that the Maoris ran over them, and at the finish
had scored 21 points to the home team’s 2. Fllgg
and Oxley, who were for some unexplained reason
left out of the first match, made by far the best
show for their side on Saturday last.

open to wager on anything, from a horse-race to a.

traps together, and win the Steeplechase at Wynd-

within bounda-and duly won the Steeplechase.

Sixteen members of the Sydney Bicycle
Club rode to Manly on Saturday, and found the
roads in fine condition. Even the hills up from
tne North Shore Ferry were negotiable by most of
the riders. At the top, the Tricycle Club was left
behind, while a few Wanderers went on ahead,

In common with most Victorian papers,
the Melbourne Herald evidently cherishes the
sweet delusion that the race for the “ Cup ’ is the
most imposing spectacle on earth. Discussing the
probability of “Our Boys” running down to the
Derby, the Herald remarks; “It is well known
taat most of them have seen the Derby before, and
were not Impressed with the sight.” It’s just this
sort of rot which misleads the native Melbour-
nean into enquiring superciliously whether the
Derby is anything like our Cup,” and helps to
engender a certain amount of prejudice between
the otherfor^bfowfflg.’’ 1 eaCh getS annoyed with

It has been found out in Fngland by Sir
George Chetwynd, the second husband of the
Marchioness of Hastings, that there is collusion
between jockeys and trainers. “ Fancy! ”
They are pretty smart at home, anyhow. And
Kngland is the freer country. If anybody even
said, out here, there was collusion between the
bookmakers and scullers, what an extraordinary
storm of indignation there would be! When we
see the result of a boat-race, now, we never hint
at anything about collusion. All we do is to
whistle, ejaculate “Funny,” and wait until an-
other honest man says “ Very,”
At the New York Athletic Club Gymna-
sium, March 23, M. W, Ford made a successful
attempt to establish a new record at one-hand
f ? D r ce-vaulting. He cleared 5ft. 3%in., and failed
at oft. 5%ln. At the annual Indoor entertainment
of the American Athletic Club, on March 19, the
same athlete, at standing hop, step, and jump,
without weights, covered 27ft. 41n„ 28ft. 51n., and
-3ft. 2(4jn., beating the previous amateur record,
28ft., Sj-fcin., made by himself on January 20,1884.
On March 22, at Brooklyn, L.I., on a board floor, in
a htty-yard handicap run, Ford won his first trial
heat in 5 5-8 sec., his second trlaJ in 5} sec., and ran
the final, which he did not win, in 5 5-8 sec. The
finest previous record was 5 7-8 sec.
In his letter to the Australasian, Hanlan
attempts to pose as the injured party; but, as a
matter of fact, the boot is on the other foot.
Beach challenged him no less than four times to a
match; and, on the occasion of a meeting held by
Beach's friends, Hanlan’s representative put in an
appearance, without invitation, and tried a bit of
bluff by stating that he was ready there and then
to make a match, but, when he afterwards found
the Beach party meant business, he shuffled—yes,
that’s the word-shuffled out of if, and raised the
figure to £1000. Why Beach should allow the
visitor two-thirds of the steamer money is beyond
us. When Hanlan pulls Layoook just off a sick-
bed, rows in front of Bob Edwards, baa a flutter
with an eight-oar crew, or goes through any such

Says the London (Eng.)
Of recent date:
With the Immense number
of bicyclists now existing,
any new Invention tending to
lessen the dangers arising
from a fall on the present
style of machine will no doubt
be hailed with satisfaction
and considerable interest. If
a rider takes a header off the
ordinary two-wheeler, what-
ever injury he may sustain is
chiefly due to the fact of the
handle of the machine pre-
venting, his legs getting free,
and this has caused many
good riders to forsake the
bicycle for the tricycle. On
Saturday last we inspected
a new invention by Messrs.
Thompson and Spence, of
London, which entirely does
away with the danger above
referred to, the handles being
fixed on prolongations of the
lower extremity of the fork,
which passes downward, so
as to clear the pedals, then
upward on either side to the
same height as in an ordinary
machine. This leaves a per-
fectly open front, so that in
the event of the rider being
thrown forward he would be
able, with a fall of about 18
inches, to alight on his feet
without being in the slightest
degree impeded by the
machine. This important im-
provement will, no doubt, be
hailed with satisfaction by a
large number of bicyclists.
That a good pace may be got
on the new bicycle can T be
5athered from the fact of
ohn Keen on Saturday riding
one of 46 inches on the Crystal
Palace track a mile in 3m. 35s.
The firm has also patented
a tricycle on the same lines."
The Galveston (Tex.) News of 25th Febru-
ary, says:—‘‘Miss Nellie Burke, the champion
long-distance lady rider, yesterday afternoon ful*
filled her promise to ride 100 miles in five hours at
Beach Park. There was a large audience in at-
tendance, the number being estimated at 3000. The
lady accomplished the arduous feat, and actually
rode 102 miles and 1073ft. in 4h. 40min. 35sec..
making 361 turns of the track and 54 changes of
horses, using 13 animals in the run. Mias Burke,
at the close of the race against time, did not ap-
pear to be in any sense exhausted, and last night
was refreshed to the extent that she was enabled
to attend the performance at the Opera House.
It is said that the record made by Miss Burke sur-
passes anything of the klpd that has ever been
attempted. It was a subject of general comment
after the race and during the evening!”
Says the British Medical, Journal : “ The
result, one day recently, of four football fights—
It is a gross misuse of language to call them
• games ’ — was that two young men lost their
lives, and two sustained fractures of the leg, in
one instance apparently a severe compound frac-
ture; one of the deaths was said to have been due
to heart disease, the other was clearly caused by
fracture of the spine in the neck.” Coming nearer

H Eit SPEECH RESTOKED.
Clair View, Inverell, December 10,1883.
Messrs. Publishers Bulletin.
Dear Sirs.—I beg to acquaint you of a marvellous
cure following on the use of St. Jacobs Oil, which
has taken place In my own family. I am a poor
man with eight children, and for years have been
a great sufferer from sciatica. My wife was ad-
vised to try St. Jacobs Oil. She procured a bottle,
and I have been using it of late with good results;
but it is of my eldest daughter, 13 years of age,
that I wish to tell you. She retired one night
about four months ago in her usual good health,
but the next morning she could not speak. My
wife took her to Inverell to see Dr. , who said
her throat was ulcerated low down, aud he pro-
scribed cod liver oil and other medicines: and also
advised her to Inhale the fumes of Stockholm tar,
saying she might never recover her speech again.
At the expiration of a fortnight, the medicine
having been finished, another visit to the Dr. was
made, who again prescribed for her, but told my
wife he had no hope of her ever being able to
speak again. We began to despair, but the day I
used the oil—about three months after she was
taken ill—I persuaded my wife, after we had
retired, to use the oil. She got up and
gave the girl two drops in water, and rubbed
It on her throat. Next morning we were
delighted to find that she could talk as well as ever,
and has been able to do so ever since.

With regard to recent aquatic events in
England, an anonymous correspondent wrote the
following to a New York paperThe match was
* P r P-" ra °iied affair, to catch the friends and
Pn?nMi.H° m“ b u ar ' By losing his race to the
Putney lad, Elliott made the English champion’s
onancGS with Ross appear a hundredfold stronger.
It Bubear can play with Elliott, who won three or
,Vi r T? 00c i race a lnst year in the States, what show
will Ross have of catching Bubear with ten seconds
start ? Right you are, says the young sculler’s
friends, and now they are laying odds on their
man. It may be that I am wrong, and that Bubear
will beat Ross; but if your man Is, as you say, ten
seconds better than George W. Lee, whom Bubear
once refused to row on even terms, then am I jus-
tlfled in staking my all on Ross being able to down
the Putney boy, and thereby empty the pockets of
his supporters.’ Ross and Elliott are warm friends,
and .taking into consideration Elliott’s perform-
ances in the States, it is not at all improbable that
jt was arranged Elliott was to lose to Bubear.
Now, we are going to give you a conun-
drum that occurred to us while at the football
match. Here it is: What is the hardest thing on
earth ? That is what we asked the man who sat
next to us; and what do you think he said ? Per-
haps you think he might have suggested a rook, or
a piece of iron, or the hearts of cruel parents.
Well, he didn’t. He turned round and quickly
said: “ Do you see that Maori who is playing with
the New Zealand team? You do? Well, if he
should ever bunt you in the bread-basket with
that head of his, you’d begin to think that about
the hardest thing you knew of was to catch your
breath again. I played against that devil once,
and was just stooping down to collar the ball when
he came up behind me with his head down, and
knocked me 33 feet and sent the ball after me
through the goal-posts.” “Did you ever play
with him again ?” we enquired, “ Play with him
again I Did you ever see a man play twice with
the same mad bull ? I’ll give you the straight tip,
stranger. I didn’t. I’m one of those men who
know jolly well when I’ve got enough of a dam
good thing.”
The big six days’ go-as-you-please, at
Madison-squara Garden, New York, came to a con-
clusion on May 8, Patrick Fitzgerald taking the
cake with 610 miles; and Charles Rowell proving
runner up with 603 miles, both men beating
Hazael’s previous best on record of 600 miles. The
winner walked on till 9 o’clock, but Peter Duryea,
Rowell’s backer, gave up the contest at 7 o’clock.
He attributed Rowell’s defeat to a badly sprained
left ankle, from which his man had been suffering
two days, and wanted to make another match with
Fitzgerald. He offered to let Fitzgerald name the
time, the amount to be over £1000 a side. At the
finish, the scores of the other men were: Panchot
566 miles, Noremao 545 miles, Herty 539 miles. Bison
525 miles. Patrick Fitzgerald, the winner, was
born at Hill o’ Llgtuff, County Longford, Ireland,
December 5, 1846, stands 5fft. IfiMin., and weighs
about list. 111b. His best six-day performance
was 583 miles 55 yards, made in N.Y. City, Decem-
ber 36 to 31, 1881, Charles Rowell was born in
Chesterton, Eng., August 13,1853, stands 5ft. 6in,ln
height, and weighs about 10 st. His best six-
day performance was 666 miles 63 yards, London,

Donald Dinnie has given the Victorians a
surfeit of “skite” with regard to the perform-
ances of Scotch athletes, and has drawn upon
himself the wrath of several correspondents in
the Melbourne Sportsman. One letter is well to
the point, and worth retailing, so we give it in
extenso “ Sib, Some weeks nave now elapsed
since Donald Dinnie stated in a letter which ap-
peared in your paper that Scotchmen could
always beat Englishmen at go-as-you-please
fighting, and anything, la fact, in the way of
athletics. I have been expecting some abler pen
than mine to champion the Englishmen. As to
Dinnle’s quarrel with Blackburn, I have nothing
to say, only that the Cumberland style of wrest-
ling must have some good points when it brings a
man of Dinnle’s enormous strength and advan-
tage of three or four stone in weight, and six
inches in height, down to a man of Blackburn’s
calibre. Now, about go-as-you-please contests.
There are no Scotchmen to be found who can beat
Rowell, the champion of the world. Where is the
Scotchman that ever came near the feats of long-
endurance walking performed by Gale, the ancient
Briton ? There is no Scotchman to be found who
can come up to Hutchens, the champion sprinter of
the world; and George, the amateur long-distance
runner, whose performances are the best ever re-
corded, is an Englishman. Scotland never pro-
duced a Renforth, a Chambers, nor a Kelly. It
never sent forth a man who could come within
cpo-ee of them in a boat. Was it ever recorded
that a Scotchman swam across the Channel as Cap-
tain Webb did? Brooks, of Oxford, cleared 6rt.
2m., and Davin 6ft. 3%in. in a high jump, both
Englishmen, and the above are the two Highest
Jumps recorded. Where is the Scotchman who had
the pluck to tackle Tom Sayers ? They have never
produced the men that could come up to Tom
Spring, King, or Mace. They have a slogger over

A brilliaait banquet was in the Town
Hall vestibule on Monday evening by the Mayor
and Mayoress of Sydney, and it was, in one way,
a departure from the usual rule, inasmuch aa
it was graced by the presence of ladles. Guests
began to arrive very early, and after being pre-
sented to Mr. and Mrs. Hardie In the Mayors
room, they dispersed about the upstairs part of
the building, where the newly completed apart-
ments and offices were thrown open for inspection.
A constant stream of persons, the fairer ones
being in full evening toilette, passed up and down
the grand staircase. The new Council Chambers-
very similar in style to the Parliament chamber—
were greatly admired tor their fine finish and
ornature, and ladies seemed to take a special
pleasure in occupying, for a few brief stolen mo-
ments, the cushioned seats on which henceforth
the city fathers will sit. while they hatch the
improvements of the city. There may be words
of wisdom, and floods of earnest, even If aitchless,
eloquence poured out there in years to come; but,
there will never be such gentle talk again in that
Doric-columned hall as there was on Monday night;
never again on those cushioned benches will such
forms of beauty rest. The suite of offices were of
secondary interest, but the Mayor’s new room was
thought very handsome. After a time spent in
inspection, while the late comers were gathering
together, the company passed into the banquet at
half-past 7, filling both sides of three long tables
and a cross head, at which sat the Mayor and
Mayoress, Sir Alfred Stephen, Sir John Robertson,
the Hons. W. J. Trickett, Alexander Stuart and
Mrs. Stuart, G. K. Dibbs, H. B. Cohen, and others.
The banquet was served hot by the Compagnoni
Catering Co., under the supervision of the manager,
Mr. E. D. Tollemacho: the tables being laid with a
centre piece of crimson velvet edged with gold
border and ferns down the entire length. The
menu* were elaborate productions of illuminated
nrlnting. bearing in the centre a picture of the
5’own Hall by moonlight, and, among other de-
the Municipal motto. “I teke, but I sur-
render.” The Young Australian band played and
sang from an up-stairs corridor while the banquet
proceeded, grac; having been duly pronounced
by a voice which seemed to come from nobody
knew where, though the Town Clerk was strongly
suspected. All the dishes were edhergood or
wonderful, from the unassuming oysters on their
native plates, to the Tutti Frutti Ice which made
teeth chatter which never chattered before. About
n o’clock, the toastmaster’s trumpetous voice was
heard, and the loyal toasts were successively pro-
posed by the Mayor. Mr. W. M Millau gave The
Ministry,” replied to by the Premier : and Mr. S. E.
Lees gave “ The Parliament, but did not seem
comfortable, and after a rather nieffcctive en-
deavour to impress upon everyone the great
utility of that important body, he made
a fresh start by addressing himself to the
“ladles and gentlemen who are not yet members
of Parliamentbut whether this was a satire
or a slip is an open point. No on® laughed. The
Hon. Alex. Stuart proposed the Corporation of
Sydney and Municipal Institutions, hoping that
ladies as well as their lords would appreciate the
improvements made in the streets. Even the
minds of Premiers are not always taenupwith
the things of the State, and no doubt the honor-
able Alexander has stood on the kerb like an
ordinary being, sometimes, and watched the
dainty boots ol Sydney maidenhood blously
wading through seas; of mud. To tins toast, a
whole forest of aldermen stood up in their frilled
shirt-fronts and laco neckties, and the Mayors of
Sydney and Newtown replied. Then a toast, not
on the programme, came—of course, the Mayor,
given byolr Alfred Stephen. For some time pre-
vious, that hon. gentleman, weighted with new
honours and the burden of years, had shown signs
of somnolency. It is alleged by those who record
thft history of great and good men that Homer
nodded and Nestor napped; “oment
arrived, it was discovered that the Lieut.-Gover-
nor of New South Wales and its dependencies was
-asleep! Having been awakened, however, by
Mrs. Roberts, Sir Allred rose to the occasion, and
with a facility gained by long experience, grace-
fully toasted tne host of the night. Mr. D. O Con-
nor championed the “Ladies; and the Press,
honoured by the desultory clinking: of some forty
remaining glasses, closed the mayoral banquet at
11 p.m. AO to the company—it included members
of Parliament, civil officials, professionals, consuls,
and others; and fully half was of what the gallant
Sir Alfred designates “the graceful and better
sex.”

Complete arrangements are being made
for the comfort and convenience of guests at the
Mercantile Rowing Club Ball on the 3rd July.
Sale and Dare will decorate the Exhibition; and
the catering has been undertaken by Mr. Thomas
Cripps. The popular Young Australian Band will
play for the dancers, and as the whole of the floor
was recently renovated and thoroughly smoothed,
dancers will find it a great improvement on pre-
vious years. The Mayor of Sydney and a large
number of influential city men have promised to
attend. Secretaries Murray and Blaokstoae again
desire to remind Intending guests that the ball is
to be an evening dress one only ibis year. Tickets
will be Issued for spectators to view the brilliant
scene from the gallery.

The annual “ ehivoo ” held by the drivers
and firemen in Goulburn came off on Saturday
night at Mandelson’s Hotel, where this solemn rite
has been celebrated for years past. The affair was
very well got up, and the enginemen proved real,
genuine, jovial fellows, and hospitable hosts. Pro-
ceedings commenced with grace, and though the
spread was, as Burns said, * T weel worth a grace as
lang’s my airm,” that preliminary was out rather
short, and the dinner soon disposed of- Toasts
followed, and they, too, were mostly short, and
allowed time for a few songs. Mr. T. Spence was
chairman, and Messrs. Ingleton and Salmon were
vice-chairmen.
* * *
At the Royal Assembly Rooms, Cooma,
the bachelors of the district recently gave their
annual ball, fully 100 guests attending. Among
the strange faces were those of a young lady from
Melbourne, and of a young visitor from Sydney,
both of whom attracted much attention. There
were a few gentlemen more than ladles, and conse-
quently no wallflowers. Dancing began at 8.30, for
a programme of 21 dances and a few extras, and
finished about 6 a.m. The local string band gave
their best music- Decorations were set reund the
ball-room, and a splendid supper served by Mr.
Gracie, of the Royal Hotel. For the belle, a choice
I was hard between two “ sweet slxteens” from the
country* who have just made their debut, while a
young lady from the Snowy River, and the petite
daughter of a leading townsman, were also much
admired. Dresses were noted for neatness, rather
than costliness; and that worn by the wife of a
Jindabyne squatter, entirely covered with pearl
beads, was extremely pretty. The toilet of a sister
from Billyllngra was also attractive, and the dress
of a Cooma lass, costly pink silk, was adorned with
birds (dead ones). The palm for d moing was car-
ried off by the younger of two sisters from Kai-
kite. On the following evening a chosen few were
invited to Coobrlngdon by Mr. Ryrle, when a Plea-
sant evening was spent, and dancing kept up till
early morning. A Benedicts Bail is now immi-
nent.

Mrs. M‘Williams recently gave a ball to
some eighty guests at her residence, Ormsby, Mar-
rickville. The ballroom was tastefully hung with
dags and evergreens, and dancing to excellent
music commenced at 8.30 p.m. A programme of
twenty-four dances, to which dve were added, was
gone through. Some very handsome toilettes were
worn. The dress of the hostess was of rich seal-
brown brocaded velvet and striped amber and
brown surah; her niece, a vivacious brunette from
Goulburn, was becomingly attired lr. pink satin
and brochA Two fair sisters from Upper tort-
street danced admirably, and looked charming-
one in white velvet and flame-coloured silk, deco-
rated with tiny birds, the other in blue velvet body
with marabout feathers and cream lace skirt. A
local belle was admired in amber silk and Spanish
lace. A good dancer from Forbes-street wore car-
dinal plush and cream satin. A bewitching young
matron from Darlinghurst looked well in cream
corded silk and ostrich feathers. The stately sister
of a young doctor wore black tulle, profusely de-
corated with geraniums. A favourite partner from
Parramatta wore a skirt of Ardolse tulle of im-
mense circumference, with satin bodice of same
colour. These are only some flowers culled from
the bouquet gathered together by Mrs. M Wil-
liams. * • •
When Madame Charbonnet-Kellermann
gave her concert on Saturday afternoon, the Pro-
testant Hall was filled by as many people as could
get into it, and ladies formed by far the larger
proportion. Rich dresses were seen, but they were
mostly dark, and of velvet, satin, or other winter
stuffs, the light dresses of the young lady pupils

showing up in pleasant relief. Numbers of well-
known musical people were present. Including
most leading pianists. The programme was very
long, and it was therefore rather a pity it was not
commeneed a little earlier than three o’clock. The
overture from “Figaro” was played by Madame
Kellermann and three of her pupils; then followed
waltz pieces, duets, concertos, &o., by various
pupils, till No. 10 was reached. This was the Hop
Hop Galop, composed by Madame Kellermann
and played on four pianos. It is lively, and likely
to be liked. Three very small fairies, named Mary
Gullfovle, Elsie Stanley-Hall, and Bertha Russell,
each played rather ambitious classical selections in
a way creditable to their own years and their
teacher s tuition. Miss Rose Samper (silver medal-
list, 1888) gave a splendid rendering of Chopin’s
Grand Polonaise, op. 53. Madame Merz, Herr
Kuster. Mdlle. Gouet, and Miss James also assisted;
and although encores were specially tabooed, they
were deserved, and frequent applause was given
to the performers. It was half-past five when the
matinee ended, and the fashionable gathering dis-
persed.

The Mayor of Sydney has been warmly
praised for the innovation at his banquet last
Monday—the presence of ladies. It might have
been the thought of their bright presence that
induced the two namesakes to end their feud. At
any rate, it is to their gentle and refining influence
man owes so much, and to their society and com-
panionship any polish or manner he may possess
is largely due. The Mayoress, who was attired In
black velvet and pink, received her guests in one
of the ante-rooms. There were numerous beauti-
ful toilettes to be seen, but space will only allow
of a few specially noticeable being mentioned.
Mrs. John Smith wore plain black velvet, set off
with white lace and a canary feather headdress;
Mrs. Sydney Buraekin, whose up-piled hair gave
her a bright and coquettish charm, pale mauve
broohe; Mrs. C. J. Roberts, a striped cream dress;
Mrs. J. Devlin, a magnificent salmon pink broche
costume, with regal train; a tall, dark lady
looked well in cerise and cream satin, and her
lately married sister appeared in ivory embossed
ilk and maize roses. Miss Sophie Frank wore a
pretty pale-pink sleeveless silk, covered with lace
flounces; Miss Q. Eagar looked nice in black net
skirts enlivened with cardinal pompons on tho
upper one; Mis* Burdett Smith was well suited in
pale blue brocho with Elizabethan collar; Mrs.
Angus Cameron, palest blue broche, with straw
colour underskirt; Mrs. A. Stuart, black satin,
with white lace c ip and collar; Mrs. Evans, a bril-
liant cardinal satin costume. Most of the matrons
wore their hair dressed high on the top of the head,
but the juniors, as a rule, adhered to the classic
and becoming Greek knot. A blonde lady in blue
and silver was admired, and her sister in a gorgeous
robe of cardinal and old gold attracted many eyes.
Two young damsels from Burwood wore respec-
tively pink net, and blue nun’s veiling, each dress
being a triumph of art. Black was greatly favoured
by both dowagers and their daughters: several
splendid flowered or embossed velvets were very
effective on tall and stately figures. Trained
dresses appear to be coming into vogue again;
several were seen on Monday evening.
Some of the Americans In this city are
“ not speaking.” We don’t know fully why, and
don’t care to, and don’t want to take sides ; bat
we think it’s a nlty they should have any little
differences-especially when their country is so
much bigger and better than any other country
created up to date. Our only business is with their
little social outbreak on the Fourth ; for it seems
they are to have more festivities than usual.
There is to be a Pionio at the Sir Joseph Banks like
there was last year, for which Mr. C. G. Jones is
the secretary. There will also be the usual
Annual Ball, glorified by the presence of the
Consul and Vice-Consul, which is to be held at the
new Masonic Hall. Mr. M. S. Hill is hon. secretary,
and tickets will be carefully circulated to ensure a
nice company. Finally, there is a Masquerade Ball
arranged for in the Exhibition Building; and
although there is a prevalent idea that naughty
people sometimes go to mask balls, we understand
it will be quite the other way in this case. The
committee not only reserve the right to identify
any masker and relieve the ball of nis company if
they think fit, but have fixed the price of double
tickets at 30s., and firmly determined to make the
thing above cavil.

The second gathering of the Orange Mer-
cantile Quadrille Assembly was a greater suoeess
than the previous ooe, between 50 and 60 couples
being present. The music was a decided improve-
ment on the last, the dresses of the ladies were
stylish and costly, and the floor rather too slippery,
causing several spills. Break-up at one o'clock,
after about eighteen dances. Two sisters from
Lord-street, one in pink and the other in blue,
divided the honour of belle; while two ladies in
claret looked charmingly conspicuous; a fair one
from Sale street, in black enlivened with cardinal,
was much in demand : and two friends, one in
pink and the other in black, from the same street,
looked nice. The wife of a local brewer, in white,
and her two city guests, seemed to enjoy them-
selves thoroughly. The wife of a solicitor was
agreeable, as usual. The two daughters of leading
merchants—one from Duntryleague, in a hand-
some costume of white satin trimmed with crushed
strawberry; the other in a neat dress of black
satin—caused a flutter. A brunette la white llama,
and a stately fair one in white and satin bodice,
both from March-street, looked charming, and
their dancing was Al. A very neat and stylish
dress was of lavender, worn by a stranger; and a
fair one from Anson-street, also a stately brunette,
in white relieved with pink, appeared to advantage.
A vivacious one in blue, with her taller com-
panion in a handsome dress of the same colour,
evidently tried to outshine their companion, a
brunette in white with black velvet bodice, battle-
mented finish, which looked very tasty. A pair
looked nice in cream; as did also a blonde from
March-street, in pink tulle.

Seldom have there been so many interested
ladies at a football match as gathered at tho Asso-
ciation Ground on Saturday. They might have
been better pleased had the N.S.W. men won, but
that did not prevent many a gentle voice from
giving admiring comments on the skiliul play of
the N.Z. victors. Once or twice there was a brief
exodus from the Stand, but most of the time the
fair onlookers remained in their seats, and there
was little to chronicle in the way of toilettes. But
a fine sunny afternoon was pleasantly passed; foot-
ball is livelier than cricket, at any rate, and the
Naval Brigade Band played popular airs. On Mon-
day next the New Zealand team are to be enter-
tained at a complimentary dinner by the Southern
Rugby Football Union at the Metropolitan Hotel. •
The fifth a fUfKxal fancy dress ball in connec-
tion with t tcailway Cricket Club took place at
the Glebe Town Hall on Friday evening last, and
must be pronounced a decided success, everything
combining to make itsuch—viz., a flno night, good
music, and excellent catering. Some of the dresses
of the ladies were really pretty and effective, and
none more so than Maritana and a Gipsy Queen.
Dancing ended about 3 a m. Messrs. Hoyle and
Neate, president and secretary of the club, ex-
erted themselves to make all pleasant.
• • •
This (Thursday) night the Owl ball in the
Town Hall is expected to be the best affair the
society has yet held. Both plain and fancy dresses
are permissible. Callaghan caters; and Mr, C.
Huenerbein, the Owls’ director, will see that there
is good music. The sale of tickets has already
ensured an attendance large enough to make the
thing a success. Dancing opens at 9 o’clock.
* * * *
The Narrandera ladies’ first hop of the
season took place on 3rd June, and was a big
success, about forty couples accepting their hos-
pitality. Belleshlp was divided between charmers
from Little Billabong and Billah respectively, who
caused no small flutter among the visiting back-
blockers But, as usual in country towns, the
bank mashers did more "cutting out” than the
stockmen To-morrow (Friday), the fourth
Bachelors’ Assembly at Nithsdale will bo hold,
closing the first series. The reunions have, thanks
to careful management, been successful in every
way. A second series commences in July An-
other social at Tattersall’s comes off also oh Friday,
when a capital programme is furnished, and the
last trams can be caught....The Mayor of Mel-
bourne convened a meeting to devise a farewell
benefit concert to Miss Alice Bees.... A fortnightly
dance in Ballarat is that of the “ Old Fogies’ So-
ciety.” Chance for the glr ! s who would rather be
an old man’s darling than a young man's “ mash.”
....The Sydney Thistle Club are cogitating over
the idea of a ball— Young men of Balmain form-
ing a society to improve themselves. Time ..
At the Royal Society’s conversazione, on the 17th
June, the decision is not to admit ladies, as it is
impossible to find room for them. The scientific
gentleman, after a careful study of the develop-
ment of ladies’ en-wire-onments, do not see their
way to any other decision until the fashions
change A recent wedding of much interest at
Bega, was that of Miss Ellen Kirby to Mr. Tom
Bateman, both of well-known families n the dis-
trict, and there was a big social gathering On
30th May the Bachelor’s Winter Party Association
gave their first < inderella at Newcastle. About
100 present in the Protestant Hall, Hardy’s band,
and plenty of pleasure—Lawn tennis flourishes
at Corowa, but the locals were beaten lately by
both Beeohworth and Bohemian teams At Mur-
rurundi, too, the lo< al silver-tails struggle with
this genteel game till they shed their buttons;
and yet they were beaten by a Gunnedah quartette
in the presence of a large gathering of their
best girls. It was very bitter Haydonton
bachelors recently gave the ladies a ball in their
School of Hearts At Appin, the young nen
break the winter with quadrille parties, but the
local editor, who always gets Invited, never dares
to say who is “ the belle,” because all the girls
have big brothers, and he might "get hurt.” As
every gentleman on the committee is descended
from either Brian Boru or the great O'Neil, the
editor’s prudence is, perhaps, natural. Something
might’Appin to him A grand charity ball was
held at Coonabarabran, when about 100 locals and
visitors merged in the Mechanics’ Institute. Mid-
night supper vanished, as few people out of Coona-
baraorau could make it go. The ladies provided
it. Dancers dispersed at daylight. The Con-
valescent Home ball was held at Brisbane a few
nights ago, very successfully A ball at Nyngan
last week in Dalton’s building netted about two
score pounds for the local Convent On Juno
2nd the Bowral Club was opened with a supper,
graced by the presence of iauics. A comfortable
room with fire, newspapers, and games, available
for 6d. a week Carlton Bicycle Club (V.) will
hold a plain and fancy dress ball on Independence
Day Both Inverell and Glen Innes have decided
not to invite Members of Parliament, other than
the district representatives, to the railway opening
festivities Last week, Dr. Beaney, famous for
his diamonds and in other ways, and president of
th* Fitzroy Bowling Club, gave a banquet to
uwftly 200 gentlemen in the Athemeum, Mel-
bourne. Mr. E. Hanlan was present, and of course
toasted. Prizes were then presented. Toasts of
“Ladies” and “Press” were promoted to the
middle of the list.... Ballarat Liedertafel had a big
ball, about 400 there, the Society providing its own
music, and rlso giving some vocal'dance airs—
Last Thursday Miss A. A. Mountain was married
at Petersham to Mr. D. M. Klrkaldie of the Rail-
way Department. The bride looked nice in a fine
ivory white dress trimmed with chlnelle, and
six bridesmaids followed her, viz., Misses Mountain,
Hogg, Howard and Walker, in pink and cream
respectively. Wedding breakfast served by Bau-
mann in a marquee at “ Ingleside,” and the newly
joined pair left in the express for Melbourne.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“ Squib Have written to you.
“Fred”: Very good, but contributors of social
items must give names.
Lad ”; Brief as you can, please.
‘‘W.A.L. We cannot enter into the little teapot
tempests of country townships’ society.
“Maude”: Many thanks. It will be obvious to
you why we had to curtail; to avoid repeti-
tion.
How’s the intelligent comp, getting on?
Oh, he's nice and hunky, thank you. and just at
the present date appears to be dreaming the' happy
hours away, and occasionally uncorking bottles up
at Dal by, for, in a recent Heuald from that
favoured city, we read:—“Lady Colin Campbell
was one of the loveliest bridges of the year when
she was married in July, 1881.” That was making
the bride ‘gee ” along with a venganoe.
Last week, we received the following
telegram from Georgetown:—“Sam the Tracker
will pull Hanlan, the champion, for five
hundred a side and the championship of the
world. In dug-outs, on the Etheridge River; the
race to be three miles with a turn, under the rules
of the right of the road. Will allow hundred ex-
penses. Man and money ready Kelly’s Hotel George-
town. Early reply will oblige. Please give this pub-
licity. Tracker’s backers anxious. — William
Kelly, Kelly’s Hotel.” We at once communicated
with Hanlan’srepresentative,who promised to wire
the champion and let us fcnowhis decision at the first
possible moment. Hanlan may urge that the dug-
out is not a best and best boat, and so give his
sable challenger the go-by; but, should he see fit
to measure propellers with Sammy the Tracker,
who can foresee but that the Etheridge may prove
a dangerous rival to the Nepean for the proud dis-
tinction of champion course of Australia. Wo at
once despatched our special artist to the proposed
scone of action, with the result of the masterly
sketch in this issue.
Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,— The question on Saturday
was “ Where shall we go ?” To the football match,
the Charbonnet-Kellerman Audit, or to the Gar-
dens, to hear the band from the Nelson ? For
various reasons we chose the latter, though we
had to pacify Edith, for not going to the Audit, by
premising to go with her to the second one, whicti
was to take place on Tuesday night. So Ned took
us te Baumann's, and got us some cream kisses,
and all sorts of nice things. He (Ned) declared
the cream kisses were nearly as delicious as the
real article Itself, and when he said it he looked
straight at Edith, as if she would be more inter-
ested in the remark than anyone else. Poor
Edith blushed furiously, so we drew our own con-
clusions ; so, perhaps, you will he able to draw
yours. And, oh ! it’s quite true that Linda Fitz-
S s is engaged to Mr. P e, and won't they
make a handsome pair ? What a combination of
wealth and beauty, to be sure 1 But, about the
Gardens and the band. It was really lovely to sit
on the soft grassy slopes and listen to the “Poet
and Peasant,” and “Dream Faces.” Eye and ear
were alike gratified, for some of the costumes were
very nice indeed. A stylish pair, the one in ruby
velvet and the other in dark green, promenaded
past us time after time. The crinolines might have
been a little less, but they weren’t. Another ruby
velvet was elaborately trimmed with deep cream
lace; but I thought it almost a pity to cover so
much of the beautiful velvet, which to my mind
looks best with but little trimming. There were
dozens of black fur tippets, which I never can per-
suade myself to admire. Black fur always looks
so depressingly sombre. But a golden brown one,
worn with a brown cloth dress, was lovely. It was
that shade of brown which glistens in tnesun, and
is wonderfully rich looking. And 1 saw through the
trees a charming russet brown—the bodice of
velvet and jupe of ottoman cloth—brown straw
hat, and a mass of pale brown feathers. A green
cloth costume had the skirt completely covered
with narrow bands of velvet, which were put on
crosswise. It looked heavy but decidedly stylish.
Jabots are being worn larger than ever, and when
made to form a nice contrast to the dress material,
are very dressy. For instance, on Saturday there
was a rich claret ottoman silk dress with plain
skirt, and a jabot of old gold brocaded satin.
Bather light material for the season, was it not ?
but the effect was very striking. Tho bonnet
was claret straw with old gold tips. Sweetly
pretty was a real old-fashioned royal blue
cashmere dress. It was plainly but fashiona-
bly made, and without any trimming. A
coquettish white straw jockey bonnet, trimmed
with velvet to match tho dress, and long blue
gloves completed the costume. Conspicuous was
a myrtle-green costume with very long pale prim-
rose gloves reaching past the elbow. It looked so
comical in the distance, almost like a short-sleeved
dress with bare arms of a sallow complexion.
When it came nearer to us, however, we saw the
wearer was very pretty, and you know, dear, a
pretty girl can wear almost anything and be for-
given. When we left the Gardens, we sauntered
round to the Art Gallery, but could get no further
that the “ Widower;” lor, somehow, alter looking
at that picture, we couldn’t see the others very
clearly. In broad daylight it is touching enough,
but in the gloaming it is inexpressively sad. It is
altogether too real.
We went to see Miss Genevieve Ward in “Forgot
Me Not” on Monday night, and there is no mis-
take—she can act. bhe has also a tine figure and
pretty arms and hands, and some of her Worth
costumes were very fine. At first she appears in a
dinner dress, tho skirt being of crimson satin
richly studded with bugles; bodice ol black satin
and lace, from which is taken a handsome lace
train. Long yellow gloves meet the short sleeves,
and crimson roses are on the left shoulder. A
walking costume of olive green and pale blue
was very effective. The upper dress was of
green satin, and the skirt of pale blue. The
large collar of rich biscuit-coloured lace was
fastened by a tasteful bunch of white flowers,
dark hat with pale blue flumes. But her evening
dress was best of all, and almost baffles my weak
powers of description. As far as 1 could make out
the skirt was a beautiful salmon-coloured merveil-
leux satin. Each pleat was trimmed with spark-
ling gold passementerie. The corsage of red
brown velvet was cut low and sleeveless, and fitted
perfectly to the figure, A small plastron of the
salmon satin was a happy contrast to the velvet.
The train was simply a wonder. A blue white
ground, most handsomely embossed with velvet in
a large pine-like pattern, the colour of the velvet
varying from the deep brown of the bodice to
paler tints. The folds of this train fell with a
charming grace, which was admired by us all. Miss
Maggie Knight looked her best in a trained dress
of black lace and satin, with just a pure white
camellia at the termination of the V-shaped
bodice. Whether it was that it stood out in strong
relief against Miss Ward's gorgeous costumes, or
whether the perfect simplicity just happened to
suit Miss Knight’s style of beauty, 1 could not
make out. I only know that it was very charming.
The circle at the Royal looks ever so gay, lately
A magnificent pearl satin dress had garlands of
pink roses completely covering the front width,
and the same round tne low bodice. Pearls in the
hair and round the neck, harmonised with the
dress wonderfully well. Feathers are much in
vogue for dress trimmings, but awfully ex-
pensive. There was a pale blue satin and broche
and beautiful blue tips were used for forming a
kind of bertha, and also tor looping up the side
drapery. A deep rose-coloured brochd admirably
became a dark lady, who wore her hair very high
and fastened with silver ornaments. Now, tbis
dress I know you will like. A pale heliotrope
satin jupe and low-necked sleeveless black velvet
bodice; on the left shoulder a lovely mass of helio-
trope feathers sweeping slightly towards the front
The feathers, being the sole ornament, were most
effective ; but 1 lelt sorry for them when the
wearer threw over her shoulders a heavy quilted
opera cloak. Just imagine how it must have
crushed them! Two sisters in black velvet Swiss
bodices over soft white muslin, and handsomely
trimmed with gold lace, looked quite uncommon.
I wonder if Rad cliff e, the flautist, is ever coming
to Sydney I Mouths back, enormous posters were
to be seen everywhere, announcing his approach,
and our hearts rejoiced. But now they are
smeared and torn (the posters, 1 mean), and have
had to take a back seat (dreadfully vulgar, isn’t It
dear?) in favour of Mrs. Anna Potts, Riggs, Genel
vieve Ward, and others—and yet he comcth not.
Ah. well I life is full of disappointments, and my
faith in posters is dreadfully shaken,
y 0 ! 1 will not scold very much for writing you
a short letter this time, I will give you a long
account of the Owl Club Ball in my next. This
pleasurable affair is to be held in the Town Hall
to-morrow night, bo now good-bye.

BULGING BUSTLES.

Woman's fickle—always changing,
Loveliness must have its way;
In the field of fashions ranging,
Fancies change her every day.
Nothing now must be closeflttiag;
On a bouncing wiry cage
Every beauty now is sitting,
Crlnolette is all the rage.
Next we’ll have them fiat as pancakes,
Nature’s contour only show
To the man who put a scan takes,
And seeks not to further know.
Ladies, drop the horrid fashion.
Do a cynic’s whim Indulge,
Something else pray spend your cash on,
Don’t put on such awful bulge.
What the female form divine is
Best is shown in Grecian dress,
That will show where beauty’s line 18,

Don’t expend your guineas two—
Avoid the one with restless rustle.
And see if a threepenny bus’ll do.

establish the seeds of Consumption in the system,
converting what was originally a simple, curable
affection, into one generally fatal. While ordinary
prudence therefore, makes it the business of every
one to take care of a cold until it is got rid of.
Intelligent experience presents a remedy in Dr.
Jayne’s Expectorant, thoroughly adapted to re-
move speedily all Coughs and Colds, and equally
effective in the primary stages of Consumption,
Asthma and Bronchitis. To be had of all Druggists
and Store-keepers; and wholesale by Elliott

Here’s that horrid, disgusting poah man

Is in London; and at a monster meeting held over
there to devise some scheme for the relief of the
Bast-end purlieus, the audacious working man, on
being told that emigration was the sole panacea
f ir all his ills, flatly replied that he didn’t want to
omigrate, and, what was more, he’d see the aristo-
cracy “domn’d” before he would. The State-
directed Emigration Association bossed the meet-
ing. and proposed that the State should undertake
to find work for the unemployed in cultivating the
land in the British colonies. And yet one ot the
London journals, speaking of the crowds assem-
bled, says “ they were an emaciated and sickly lot
of human beings, totally unfitted for fa rough
colonial life, and who, very likely, if they had work
offered them, would prefer to lead an easy, indolent
kind of life, picking up here and there j ust sufficient
to keep them alive.” During the progress of this
meeting a Mr. Boyd observed “There are 300,000.000
•acres of vacant land in Canada.” “ Millions of ice-
bergs, y’mean,” yelled the ungrateful and grum-
bling fifteen hundred present. “ What about the
land here?” and then one of the most daring of the
lot scrambled up on the platform and declared
that “if gentlemen of sporting proclivities would
give up tne land of which they were ‘fraudulently
Possessed,’ work could be found for a large num-
ber of the unemployed at homo.” There was just
ti eoupfon of truth about this statement, too, for
ft h a Henry George statistical fact that, “in Eng-
land. there is more land lying idle in sporting
grounds, game preserves, and landlords’ parks,
than the old kingdom of Belgium, which supports
in happiness and prosperity 6,000,000 people, and
sends large food exports to London. An income of
$175,000,000 a-year is received by 8142 landlords as
rent on 45,500,000 acres of land.” However, this
speaker’s chat was received !with tumultuous ap-
plause, and, emboldened by the cheers, the speaker
continued, that “ in view of the industrial depres-
sion now prevailing in the United States, in Aus-
tralia, and in New Zealand, the meeting declared
against State-aided emigration as no remedy for
the depression amongst the unemployed at the
East-end of London, and called for some reason-
able scheme of home colonisation and State em-
ployment of labour at home, which should at once
be set on foot, so that the unemployed, who were
ready and willing to work, might not, with their
wives and children, be left destitute or forced into
pauperism.” This looks as if the Australian
colonics do not monopolise exactly all the “ work-
ing-man trouble ” just at present, and clearly
shows that British statesmen must devise some
other means of relief for their starving poor than
exile—for “these be parlous times,” and once
Hodge takes the bis teeth there is no
telling how far he will bolt, or what damage he
will do whilst on his frantic journey.
But a lew short yeirs ago the greatest liv-
ing persecutor of the human race was universally
acknowledged to be the Assurance Company fiend,
who button-holed his victim at every turn and
insisted on assuring his life under table B., in order
that he. the victim, might soon be enabled to die
and leave his delighted spouse a few thousand
pounds, to facilitate her chances of catching on
to a new husband. Now, however, the champion
torturer is admitted to be the patent-medicine
almanac compiler, and as a specimen of his devilry,
we quote the following tale. A few days ago, a
certain Wesleyan clergyman was taken suddenly
ill, and before night it was seriously feared that
every moment would bo his next. Shortly before
12 o’clock the sick man’s watchers were horror-
stricken to find a rope with half a brick attached,
coming down the chimney, and in a few seconds
after, a tall gaunt - looking wild - eyed man de-
scended by the help oi this rope, and walking over
to the dying man’s bedside, said—“Ex-cuse the
abruptness of my intrusion, sir, but hearing you
were pretty far along on the road to glory, I
thought it vould bo extremely injudicious, even
cruel, on my part to postpone this visit any longer.
My name is Dodger Rufus Autilochus Dodger, and
I am the sole editor and publisher of those charm-
ing little volumes which so truthfully, and I flatter
myself 1 may also say eloquently, put forward the
undoubted efficacy of that world-renowned, life-
restoring mixture, Professor Hugo von Schlager’s
Concentrated Essence of Gemmatious Gee-
bung, 2s. 6d. per bottle, and be surd that you
get the genuine article.” Here the new comer
took a chair and hoisted his heels on the sick-
man’s pillow, and lighting a ten-for-a-shilling cigar,
continued ; “Now, why I called on you to-night,
oldman, is this. Try a weed? No. That’s O.K. Then.
Y’see th’ fact is, our almanac game has been done
t’ rags. We want t’ strike a totally new patch
altogether, and I rather guess I’ve roped th’ right
idea. Here it *s. You’re about to scoot off t’th’
Golden Shoah, an’ join th’ Hallerberlooyue
band, and wear wings instead of flannel-
shirts, an’ all that. Very well. My notion
is for you to give me the order to publish a hand-
some 13mo. book of your life and labours, and on
every second page I could work in some regular
ring-tail old snorts of testimonials from the count-
less millions who have been dragged from the
howling abvss of hell’s own despair by the miracu-
lous efficacy of Professor Hugo von Schlager’s
Concentrated Essence of Gemmatious Geebung,
2s. 6d. per bottle, and do not be imposed upon by
the spurious Imitations of any mean, despicable,
low-down imitators. Ain’t y’ got a spittoon?
Never mind. Don’t rise. Now, y’ see, we’ll
work it this way.- I’ll write your life
to start with. Of course, I don’t know
anything at ail about it, except that you
were apparently born, and died, but I’ve got
a lot of old trash at home, such as ‘Lives of
celebrated Highwaymen,’ ‘Pox’s Book of the
Early Martyrs,” ‘ Diary of a Drunkard,’ ‘Mar-
garet Catohpole,’ and such stuff, and I’ll chip a
page out of ono, and a funny yarn out of another,
and draw on the martyrs for the drivel, and then
we ll stick gobs of advertisements in the daily
papers, such as ‘Life of a Lover of the Loard !
Startling disclosures 1 He is tempted by Satan, but
cutsoff the Serpent’s Tail !' Take it home to your

Never mind, I’ll charge the widow for professional
services rendered.” Then the long man skipped,
and even the corpse seemed relieved.
Here we are again. Same old drunk as
usual. This time, however, there are a couple of
incidents in connection with the recent “ tear ”
which are well worth recording. Last Sunday
night week, the sylph-like form of Lady Munro
was seen sailing down to the Temperance Hall,
Melbourne, to attend a meeting of prayer and
praise which was held by the gallant Salvation
Army. It appears that the last time this giddy
young representative of the Dudley family toed
the Police Court scratch in order to explain why
she went hallooing and raising Cain around town,
and subsequently wound up her amusement by
splitting a policeman’s things from Dan to Beer-
sheeba, the P.M., Mr. Call, was so touched by the
sight of helpless beauty in distress, that he im-
ploringly asked, “ Cannot something be done for
this poor young woman ?" Something was done.
First of ail, her ladyship “done” the court
officials to the extent of a guinea, and for the rest
of the day jov reigned supreme, and the star of
the Dudleys shone out as bright and clear as a
brass tack in an old hair trunk. Next morning
brought repentance, and the customary longing
for soda-with-a-dark-bottom. Then a Salvation
Capting came along with both, and made a con-
quest. The hitherto untameable Dudley was
touched at last, and, when she mounted the plat-
form at the Temperance Hall on the following
Sunday night, the members of the Harmy were
jubilant; the now convert’s case was pointed out
as evidence of the good work the tambourine-
thumpers were doing, and the hallorlooyers that
rent the air wore as loud asaLlmburger cheese or a
whole park of field artillery, On the Tuesday fol-
lowing, however, the frail beauty met a man who
was not a Gospel-grinder by a long way, and the
result was that when she got to the Temperance
powwow that night she wanted to sit on the Chair-
man's knee and sing “ You may kiss me and caress
me, and I won’t tell my Ma,” upon which the dis-
gusted Maiah shouted “Git orf, you wicked wo-
man, or I’ll hit you over the head with something
and then he pushed her away, and was about to
start “The gate’s ajar,” when the infuriated Dud-
ley gave him a jar with the chair that knocked the
Salvation hero clean over the ropes and out on the
top of the big drum. After this her ladyship
grabbed the water-bottle and went for the celestial
choir in a style that ruffled a great deal of the
angelic soprano’s religious fervour and calico
skirts; but order was at last restored, and the fair
Munro was carted off to the exterior darkness,
where there was much gnashing of teeth and ex-
cited language. Shortly after this, a well-known
Scottish divine came along, and seeing how the cat
jumped, thoughtfully handed her ladyship a tract,
and then gave her a blood-curdling lecture. When
the reverend divine was through, the great Munro
quietly told him to keep his tract, and then per-
tinently enquired how it was possible to be vir-
tuous on an empty stomach. The worthy parson,
who is evidently not a bad sort, admitted the force
of this reasoning, and taking the New Magdalen
into a popular restaurant, he treated her to the
best of everything. Just as the worthy pair
had settled down to work on the poultry, however,
her ladyship, having rapped a passing waiter over
the ear with her gingham to attract nls attention,
leant over and whispered something into his capa-
cious ear-hole. A few seconds after this, the
gar 9 on returned, smiling all over his face like a
baked pig, and carefully rubbing the seal-dust
off the mouth of a splendid pint bottle of Moet
and Chandon’s Gold-top fizz. This was coming it
just a trifle too strong for the meenister, and he
flatly declared he would not pay for “ gold-top ”
liquors, no matter what consequences might
folio iv. That, of course, was playing right into
the Dudley’s hands, as the place was now
full, and, so standing up, her ladyship asked the
assembled crowd what they thought of a masher
who asked a lady to dine with him, and then tried
to shirk out of paying for what she ordered.
“Look at him,” screamed the Munro, “isn’t he a
nice old rooster to go doing the lah-di-dah, and
then try to run me off on a three-bob tuck-out,
and a bottle of ginger ale to wash it down with
Isn’t he k jammy old .” That closed the case
for the Crown. The distracted meenister clutched
his hat, gave the waiter two sovs., and without
waiting for his change dashed out and had a
vapour bath, fully determined to let all titled
Magdalens go to the d —1 their own way for the
future. Her ladyship polished off the parson’s
dinner and her own, drank up the fizz, and is now
prepared to stand another conversion on the same
liberal terms as she received from the Scotch
parson.
This is the truthful tale of Smith, Brown,
Jones, and Robinson. The first three-named
jokers wore “ damping the enemy ” round at Dick
Thatcher's whisky-mill, the other day, when Smith
observed, ‘K)h, by the Holy Frog, Brown, old man,
our friend Jones here said one of the smartest
things the other day that I have ever heard, and
I’m a remarkably early riser, too, Y’ see, Jones
had been out to a lodge-night shlvoo, and himself
and the boys had a high old time, you bet. Goln’
home, however, Jones tripped over the back of
his head, and fell down a cellar; and when they
picked him up, he looked like a bill-sticker’s wall
after a heavy thunder-storm had played upon it.
Next morning, I met him on the fram, and when
he told me all about how the battle raged on the
previous night, I said, * Blow it all, Jones, how did
y’come to fall down the cellar?’ And then sez
Jones, sez he, ‘ Notwithstanding.' See th’ joke,
Brown? The reason he fell down was certainly
* not with standing.’ Wasn’t it bully ? By thunderl
I think I'll stick it in th’ Boolyteen.” Then the
worthy trio hoisted in some more cold pizun, and
skipped away to business. Next day, Brown,
Jones, and Robinson ran together at Bass Hodge’s
Academy of Aquafortis, and as they blew the
creamy froth all over their clothes, Brown ex-
claimed. “ Jumpin’ Jezabel, Robinson 1 Smith
told me a yarn yesterday about this hoary
headed old vagabond, Jones, here, that id make an
oyster laugh at its own funeral. Lemme see-
how’s this it went? Oh, ah, got it now. Jones
was on the Jamberoo the other night, and as he
was going home he landed on his back bosom at
the bottom of a six-foot cellar. Next day, Smith
met the old ’un on the cars, and sez he-sez Smith,
you know—* Hang it all, Jones, how did you come
to fall over that way ?' And what d’ye think this
old gorilla said? Why he yelled out ‘Notwith-
standing.’ Wasn’t that good for Jones ? The rea-
son he fell down was, of course, not with standing ”
“Crucified CiBsarl” roared Robinson, “that lays
over anything I ever heard before. Why, jam it
all, Jones, you’re a born humourist. All you want
is a red cover and a couple of gross of libel writs
against you to be the boss comic paper of the
colony. Set ’em up again, my bloomin' saxophone
splutterer, an’ we’ll drink t’ Jones, th’ Artemus
Ward of all Australia.” The following day, Mrs.
Jones noticed that her old man wore on extremely
pensive look, and seemed to be completely off his
kadoova balance. At breakfast he emptied the
milk jug over his steak in mistake for the ket-
chup; at dinner he put the mustard in his tea;
and at night he spent ten minutes trying to light
the bath-room tap which he fully believed was the
gas jet, and in short he carried on so absurdly al-
together that Mrs. Jones slipped out and slept with
the servant girl for safety. Next morning, how-
ever, Jones was found dancing round the house
like a Cooktown Kanaka with six inches of rum
behind his “pinny,” and catching sight of his
terror-stricken wife he grabbed her round the
neck and screamed, “ Hoo-ray, ole girl! I’ve got it
now —wasn’t it damn strange I couldn’t see th’
thing before. It’s all round th’ town! Fellers
yelling about it at every corner 1 Bulletin
people looking for me everywhere. Wanter gi'
me fifty pouns a week to sling jokes for ’em.
Why don’t you laugh, too ? ” “Git away; you bald-
headed old ass,” shouted Mrs. Jones “ if anybody s
lookin’ for you, it’s th’ perleece, or the lunatic
asylum people.” “No, taint my love,” said Jones.
“ Hold on till y’ hear th’ yarn. Remember th’ ether
night that I fell down th’ cellar an’ mashed all my
face about ? Well, next day, Smith and me were
goln’ into town, an’ sez Smith t’ me when I told
him about th’ spill.” “ How the mischief did y’
manage t’ fall down a cellar, anyway?” And d ye
know what I said t' Smith,then? Why,! said ‘N eveh-
theless ” —that’s the joke: ain’t it a hummer ?
Don’t it make y’ feel fit t’ run outside and kick
yerself with laughing?” “No, it don’t,” replied
the disgusted wife; “I don’t see any joke in the
thing at all.” “Of course y’don’t,” yelled Jones,
as he did a fandango round the room once more:
“ of course y’ don’t see it now. It'll take three
days before y’ can. I didn’t see it myself when I
said it, and I didn’t when Smith told Brown, or
Brown told Robinson either, although we all
screamed again over it, but the three days are up
this morning, an’ now I’ve just struck the Joe
Miller in all its glory. Don’t forget what I said—
the reason 1 fell down the cellar was Nevertheless —
fimme me boots, quick ; there goes old
[‘Gogerty—I’ll dash right out an' tell him the fun,
toe. And you come to the front gate and see him
split into chips when I say it was Nevertheless that
did the deed.” But M’Gogerty didn’t split any
more than a bowl of soup would, and now Jones is
worrying round to find Smith and ask if the word
shouldn’t be Now-a-days, or None-such. And as
yet Jones is absent from the Boolytken.


A PRETTY FACE.
What Is more to be desired by a yoang lady than

which will fit her to be an ornament to society
but if she have a sallow countenance, and her face

The dead man opened .hys ohapless jaws,
And groaned three eldritch groans,
As from out of hys mou th, to the northe and the

He spat out hys own tlugh-bones.
We don’t know that fc,he above poetry has
„ sort of especial connection with, or relevance
*o what we’re going to tell you, but we found it
in'lngoldsby, and thought it s uch singularly felici-
tous verse to come from a clergyman's pen that it
would more fitly serve to introduce a solemn story
of death than the more trivial, not to say giddy,
rhvmes of Watts and Wesley. ‘.There is a breadth
«nd grandeur of conception-a B ULLETixish grasp
—about this, that we regret to i ay is deplorably
absent from the work of many of the other religi-
ous poets. These singers of the h arp and crown
-foreshow no higher hope than a mystic spiritual
deathlessness—a state of winged »md enduring
pcstacy—an immortal Intensity of bliss, before
which the human mind cowers appalled and
blinded. The seers of the Church sing* of a shining
eternity of Life in crystal mansions-t >f waltzing
round the Lamb tor ever on strictly tt anperance
drinks-of singing Hosannahs in the high est all day
and all night (but there’s no nlglrt there)*
for ever and ever, with no chance of any-
thing with a body in it. The joy of such a
Paradise is too strong-it is as going up from the
midnight to a bright room. No one would stay
there who had been much about New South Wales
-particularly Hay or Albury way. The o hange
wouldn’t be gradual enough. They would l>e for
getting back: they would choose rather ana ihila-
tlon than a beerless futurity with no visible off-
end to it: they would lift up their voices, and .sing
with Longfellow—
“Rest—rest! O give me rest and peace
The thought of joy that cannot cease
Has something in it like despair,
A weight I am too weak to bear.
They would be for ever trying to get at Peter, to
“send the billy out somewhere, for God’s sake/’
They would continually worrit him by offering to
swap new grease-proof crowns for his old one, if
he'd go; they would offer to take the gate, and be
very "careful about Mudgee people while he was

singers of Moody and Sankey, is not the place for
a p >ople already goaded to insanity by the Sunday,
closing clause. We are descendants of the British
nation, and as angels we wouldn’t go back on ou r
traditions, nor strike one blooming harp without
stimulants at regular intervals. The glory o
England was built up on a foundation of Beer_
The Spanish Armada was defied by soldiers who
habitually drank Beer in large quantities. Shak
speare lived on (and died of) Sack, and who would
like to meet Mm and not be able to say “ got a
mouth on you. Bill ? ” How happily did poor old
Gordon hit off the Briton in “ Ashtaroth.” This is
the quatrain he puts in Lucifer’s mouth when
speaking of the English soldier, Thurston:—

drinks, . :
In Hell he would hardly go thirsty, if given
An inkling of any good liquors in Heaven.

In 1856 there lived at Yackandandah—but
hold on. We’ll come to that directly; but j ust now
we’ve struck a lead of speculation, suggested by
lngoldsby’8 beautiful lines, that we’re going to
follow until it dips. Admitting (which, of course*
everyone will do,) that Heaven, as sung by the
Christian poets, is too vast and far-advanced,
and generally thin, to be ever much used
by colonials; and admitting (which, of course,
everyone will do) that the dead must pass the
time somehow, what a splendid opening for in-
dulging in wholesome fun, do the lines above
quoted disclose ! While the prophets and
dreamers have been away exploring the skies for
likely-looking country for the soul, Ingoldsby has
supplied a long-felt want by pointing out a cheer,
f ul and exhilarating game tor the body, which in
these athletic days will probably be largely availed
of. What could be much nicer for a lot of corpses,
than to sit up in their graves and fraternise with
each other, and back their different fancies at
bone-blowing ? Imagine an olden churchyard at
midnight, with the moon low in the west, and the
screech-owl and bat abroad I Twelve would toll
from the mossed belfry, and the hilarious Remains
would shake themselves together and toe the mark.
Of course, politicians, from the peculiar formation
of their mouths, and their long earthly practice at
giving vent to opinions and things, would be
placed at scratch. The thigh bones would be care-
fully chosen, and those of Press men always prefer,
red on account of their thinness and peculiar value
as projectiles. Thus things would come square, and
reporters could win a handsome competence
through hiring out their femurs to the competi-
tors at so much a blow, they being debarred by
their profession when in the flesh, from competing.
Bush-missionaries’ femurs would be at a discount,
owing to abnormal enlargement at the lower ends,
caused t.y persistent “flopping;” Chief Secre-
taries’ thigh-bones would be considered too
spongy and unreliable ; and Bishops’ wouldn’t
bo considered for a moment on account
of their excessive bulk and solidity. There
would be no reason, that we are aware ol, to con-
fine the spitting to the “ northe and southe,” as in
the case Ingoldsby mentions, but there would need
to be well-defined rules, and a watchful longstop
appointed lest any of the bones should bo lost.
The bookmaking, also, should be under strict dis-
cipline. No totalisator or Fancy Fayre distribu-
tion should be allowed within the graveyard under
any pretext, and no corpse should be allowed to
bet its head on any event. The betting should be
confined strictly to the game, and no wagers as to
the result of the General Judgment should be
allowed. At the conclusion of each match, every
bone should be returned to its proper skeleton,
and all wagers paid, and everything put square
and tidy, in case Gabriel should blow before next
meet. Any skeleton found fighting, or in other
than a sober condition should be turhed out into
the street, and — [Say! What are you giving us ?
The story, man, the story!—Ed. B.j
• ' 9 9
In the year 1*54, there lived in the vaults
of St. Denis [Hold on, there: you said Yack-
andandah!— Ed. B.] Ah—yes! an elderly man from
foreign parts, called O’Donahoo. (We’re not sure,
now, whether it was in Yackandandah or Wo-
donga, but it was in Victoria somewhere.) O’Don-
ahoo was a very big man, and lived in a bark hut
up the hill side with his wife, Bridget, who
will cut an important figure in this narrative.
Gold was to be got pretty handy in those
days, and O’Donahoo got plenty of it, but
continued to live in the old hut up on
the hill-side, in an apparent state of gaunt and
baggarej peed, Neither he nor Bridget ever had
enough clothing on to render an Egyptian Mummy
presentable, and O’Donahoo never went out save
to fossick by himself, or bring home a bit of tucker
from the township. He was a puzzle to every-
body. He had been heard to say “ Nabookllsh,”
also “ the curse o’ Jarses an ye,” and he was con-
sequently half-suspected of being Irish. But then
he never attended the sacrifice of the Mass, so
people couldn’t make up their minds. But they
found out this way O’Doaohoo was suffering from
toothache, and in that there came upon him a dim
recollection that he'd somewhere heard that it
wasn’t a bad line to keep the teeth clean, so after
much consideration (for, barring a religious editor,
he was the meanest cuss on earth) he sallied forth
to buy a tooth-brush. He went into the chemist’s
shop—there was one just started a canvas affair—
and, in his barbarous jargon, asked for one, right
in frent of all the boys. But tho unhappy youth
behi nd the counter thought he said fiatr-brush so he
he asked briskly and jocularly, “ Certainly, sir,
will you have a soft one, or one that’ll take all the
hair off V’ There was a roar and a rush, and, as
Swinburne sayeth, “ Rent flesh fell every way, and
blood flew, and fierce fragments of no more a
man! ” Then the boys saw what part of tho world
O'Donahoo was from. It is singular how these
little national traits are perpetuated and In our
opinion.—[Are you going to tell this yarn or not ?
Ed, B.]
♦ • •
Well, one day Bridget fell ill, and dread-
ing the trouble of an inquest more than for any
other reason, O’Donahoo got a doctor for her,
under whose care she promptly died. Then the
old boy deoi ’ed to save money on the funeral. He
was too poor, he said, to have an undertaker with
a black suit on, and hearses, and plumes, and
things, so he set to, after getting the doctor’s cer-
tificate, to bury her out behind the hut. For a
coffin he got the beef-barrel out of the hut, and
having carefully put the two last pieces of
salt junk out on a slab to dry, he jammed Bridget
into it clown fashion, and with her head and feet
sticking out, put it on a wheelbarrow and started
along the hillside to the grave. But the night was
dark, and he tripped over a rock, and Bridget went
down the hill at the rate of twelve thousand re-
volutions per minute into the river. O’Donahoo
was puzzled—he would have given it best at once,
but ha was afraid the Inspector of Nuisances would
be after him to burn the body next day. [An In-
spector of Nuisances in ttusse times! Preposter-
ous I- Ed. B.] Who’s telling this yarn, anyway?
So ke went down and groped about for a while,
and then decided it was tb.e will of the Lord, and
gave It up. In the meantime, the exercise in the
fresh uir had revived Bridget, who wasn’t dead at
all, amd she drifted down the Murray towards
Adelaide. But. in attempting to pass Albury, she
was seized by Bingwood on behalf of the N.S.W.
Customs as foreign goods; but after apologising
and explaining the peculiarities of the case, and
promising never to offend again in a similar
manner, she was sent back to Donahoo, who re-
ceived her with joy, as he had saved four shillings’
worth of tucker by her absence and gained a beef-
cask by her return (for she pulled up the river in
it again). And they all lived happily for ever
afterwards, and O’Donahoo is now Mayor of—
somewhere in Victoria. [We are disappointed in
this story—there’s no moral whatever to it, and we
oon’t think it has even the negative merit of truth.

The Bad and Worthless
are nwer imitated or counterfeited. This is es
pecially true of a family medicine, and it is positive
proof that the remedy imitated is of the highest
value. As soon as it had been tested and proved
by the whole world that Hop Bitters was the pur-
est, befit and most valuable family medicine on
earth, many imitations sprung up and began to
steal the notices in which the press and the people
of the country had expressed the merits of H. B.
and in every way trying to induce suffering in-
valids to use their stuff instead, expecting to make
money on the credit and good name of H. B.
Many others started nostrums put up in similar
style to H. B., with variously devised names in
which the word “ Hop ” or “ Hops ” were used in a
way to induce peeple to believe they were the
same as Hop Bitters. All such pretended remedies
or cures, no matter what their style or name is,
and especially those with the word “Hop” or
“ Hops ” in their name or in any way connected
with them or their name, are imitations or
counterfeits. Beware of them. Touch none of
them. Use nothing but genuine American Hop
Bitters, with a bunch or cluster of green Hops on
the white label, and Dr. Soule’s name blown in the
glass. Trust nothing else. Druggists and Chem-
ists are warned against dealing in imitation or
counterfeits.
The reporter of the Melbourne D.T. was in
the right spot for news lately. He was up near
the head of Collins-street, and must have had his
eyes open, for he noticed a man stagger and fall
heavily off the footway. He acted the good
Samaritan, of course, and then went down to his
office and wrote up the incident. This was a
genuine, first-hand incident. It had not appeared
“elsewhere,” and he laid himself out to do it in
irreproachable English. He therefore says that
“the individual foil on his face in tho water
channel.” That is graphically described. One
almost sees the individual achieving tho incident.
Thus: He comes down Celline -street, staggers on
the footway, reels over the water channel, sees his
face down there looking up at him, and forthwith
“falls on to it.” Must have been that way. Can’t
see how else he could do it.
What troubles Ballarat now is that its
straight-legged young women can’t get the young
men to dance. Ballarat has got excessively high-
toned since Bishop Thornton brought out the
charitable offerings which the episcopal purring
drew from soft-hearted strangers. It has quitted
begging for a while, and pressure is being em-
ployed to drive the energy from tho hollowed
palms down into the legs. It is well to observe a
change to anything, and the mammas in low
drosses, who go about sighing because the young
men don’t cotton to this particular change, merit a
little sympathy. But, still, the young men who
decline to dance are not to be too severely cen-
sured. As a rule, their legs are very thin and
crooked, and except they were really fond of a
girl, they wouldn’t be expected to spend as much
time dressing and padding as would remove the
risk of an accident in the ball-room. Now, if the
mammas would start praying, their daughters
would get on better. Men don’t want shapely legs
for praying. All they want for praying is plenty
of mouth. That’s Just into the hands of the young
men of Ballarat. Wny not try that for a change ?
As it is, mammas, in their indignation, threaten
that they will not buy expensive ball-drosses for
the incoming season. Which makes it appear that
the young men referred to are drapers. But this
is hardly fair. Before adopting so extreme a
course they ought to try how praying would take
as a social amusement.
This is what a slaughterman told a Balla-
rat scribe, the other day:—“There is not much
harm in a flukey sheep, but the pneumonia must
be bad for the customers, I should think. We
have got used to a little fluke in sheep, and it don’t
make much difference in it. You should see the
cattle with the pneumonia, though. I have seen a
warm carcase, when the cow has dropped dead
from pleuro in the yard, dragged on to the
slaughtering floor and dressed. Of course the
lungs are not allowed to lie round; they could be
notic. a by the inspector. Not much. We rip
them up, tear out the skin lining the inside of the
chest, wipe it over with a damp rag, and I tell you
it wants a smart man to see then that the animal
had the pneumonia. Why, I have known a couple
of buckets of matter taken out of the lungs of one
animal which was slaughtered and sent into the
market. We don’t fool round with the stuff, I can
tell you, and it soon goes out of sight. Pneumonia
isn’t much, though; the Cumberland disease,
blackleg, is the thing to make meat look nasty. It
makes the animals’ blood look like tar, the flesh
dark, but they say all the ‘badness ’ in It comes out
in the cooking. If people want to know some-
thing of how much pneumonia and blackleg there
is among cattle, they have only to go to the abat-
toirs at the right time. The inspector is there,
perhaps, half a day, but he don't see anything
wrong going on, of course. When he goes away
and, perhaps, is snug in bed, the ‘sick ’uns’ are
attended to, and no time lost about it, either ?”
Splendid legend: splendid lie. This im-
mortal phrase of Samuel Clemens applies particu-
larly to a story wo got from America, the land of
fearless fictions, of a West Virginia mountaineer
who came down the other week to the old city of
Staunton to “replenish his empty pocket-book by
selling two of his best slaves. He had never
heard of the abolitionists, never heard of Daniel
Webster or Henry Clay, or Wendell Phillips, never
heard of the war of Secession; never heard of
anything about anything except hoe-cakes and
tobacco, in fact. When he found that the face of
things had changed since his last descent from the
mountains, he turned his back on the city and
made for home, taking his two slaves with him.
And yet this story, marvellous as it is, might not
be a lie. We have met men in the bush who have
lived a still more secluded life, and were im-
measurably more ignorant of the outside world
than the West Virginia mountaineer. There is,
for instance, a poundkeeper in Queanbeyan who
has never seen a (railway—at least, he had never
seen a railway when we saw him last—and thinks
it a sort of shoot down which passengers are fired
by a steam catapult. And yet ne is happy. Then,
we know hundreds who have never seen the sea,
and refuse to believe that it is bigger than the
Darling at flood time. We have known men who
had no idea who God is, and others—but these
lived in the very remote bush—who had never
even hoard of Henniker Heaton. So that we are
pot going to give in to America, even in ignorance.
Talking of brotherly love, oy the way, wo

and give the culprit a clean sheet to start on.
Down South, there hangs out a certain member of
the Fourth Estate, who is the proud possessor of a
small potato patch, a brlndle cow, and a rough but
honest sort or a brother. We mention the brother
last—that being the position ho holds in the affec-
tions of his oulchawed, high-toned relation. This
Orson-like brother also rejoices in the possession
of a cow called Poley, and he is furthermore
blessed by enjoying the privilege of Jiving next
door to the bloated pressman, unfortunately for
Orson, however, his particular cow seems to have
but a very shady resp?ot for the principles of
ineum and tuum, and in the silent hours, when all
Nature is steeped in slumber sweet, Rosy kicks a
?ap in the editor’s fence, and then trots into hi*
avourite spuds, and has quite a rosy old time
until morning. This, of course, makes the potato
proprietor as mad as a bob-tall bull in the fly
season; and for the past three months he hag en-
deavoured to scare the soul out of the beggar next
door and his cow, by printing scathing philippics
about “ ruffianly miscreants who recognise neither
the sacred laws of God, nor man,” and throwing out
fierce, blood-curdling threats of the avenger’s
flashing steel, and the local “pound," all of which
had about as much effect on Foley’s innocent
owner and herself, as a bread pill would have on
one of the mummied Pharoahs. Last Saturday
morning, however, our Indignant knight of the
paste-pot and shears determined to put an end to
this kind of thing for ever, and summoning the
whole staff, set to work, and before night dug a
pit about 4ft. wide and 10ft. deep, Just inside his
potato-patch enclosure. Then he retired to roost,
chuckling as he went over the fun he was about to
have with Poley. Next morning, sure enough,
there was a broken-legged cow flopping around In
the ditch, and bellowing like a double-barrelled
fog-horn in a young typhoon. Five minutes later,
the delighted journalist was pounding away at his
neighbour's door like a Crusader crank at the gates
of Ascalon. “ Your sanguinary cow’s broke Its
neck in my yard,” shouted the gleeful editor
“ Hell I ” roared the other fellow. And these were
the first words the brothers had spoken to each
other for thirteen years. Round ran the worthy
pair to the pit, and it was then discovered that ft
was the cunning journalist’s own cow that had
fallen in, and Poley was as safe and sound as the
Bank of England. It took the editor and all bis
staff ten hours to haul the brute out, and now the
two brothers love one another worse than over.
“Oh, j cannot bear to think of thoss
dreadful things,” said one woman in her delicate,
gauzy laces. “What others have to endure, you
might at least bear to think of,” said the other
softly. Before us is a little book written by
Ellice Hopkins, London, 1884, containing some of
these dreadful things. They are so dreadful that
we are sure all right-thinking persons and respect-
able journals would never dream of dragging
them to sight. With pious propriety would they
cover them up—suppress even the mention of
them—for they are things that comfortable society
cares not for its thoughts to dwell upon. Just so.
That is the reason Eliloe Hopkins has written ;
because, what others have to bear, “ respectable ”
people might at least endure to think of. It is
through the unctuous purism that deliberately
shuts out of sight everything vulgar and disagree-
able that “God’s England (as Milton called her) is
in danger of becoming tho land of child-harlots."
This is new and startling. But it is a deduction
from the evidence of the police specially gleaned
for a committee of Parliament. Ten thousand
children are reckoned to be growing up in brothel
houses ; and it is an indicative fact that a London
penitentiary which, 20 years ago, was only for bad
women, was opened 10 years ago to grown girls,
and the admissions have since bad to be extended
to girls as young as 0 and 10. In one week, throe
child-girls were dealt with who had reached the
depths of physical vice; one at 13, another 9.
and the third, at the age of nine, was a mother!
This latter case was the subject of special cor-
respondence between the Home Secretary and
district police. The streets of ©very large town
are never void of “ the strange woman ” at night;
but never before has attention been so pointedly
directed to the way thousands of children go, even
before reaching their teens. Living amid vice,
bearing, seeing, talking, almost breathing it, is It
any wonder which way they go ? The law against
seduction in England scops at the age of 13, while
It is a physiological fact that 16 is the most danger-
ous age of girlhood, and more girls go wrong at
that time than any other. Girls on the Continent
are protected by the law up to 31; but In England
beyond 13, only when possessed of property. The
working girl is supposed to take care of herself.
Hence It Is that children live, year after year, In
the one single room, where grown women carry
on woman’s lowest trade. This is unchecked by
State interference, and G. R. Sims has broadly
asserted that there can be no evil surer to spread
crime than this utter destruction of innocence in
the young. This, then, is why Ellice Hopkins
writes, with a barbarous disregard of the feelings
of right-thinking people, on the groat moral ques-
tion. It is the ignoring of these things, by “ a sky-
high Christianity, with its bead in the clouds, and
its feet in the intolerable mud,” that has really
caused their spread. And if any are answerable
for the lost young lives, it is those who cultivate
a determined ignorance of every subject that isn’t
“ nice.” Ecclesiastical organizations have been so
busy “saving souls, that they have inadvertently
overlooked men and women I

The use of this valuable mouth wash Insures
entire freedom from toothache and decay of the
teeth. There are three kinds, distinguished by a
Yellow, Green, and Red Silk Thread attached to
the bottles. That with the Yellow stops instantly
the most Violent Toothache. That witn the Green
is invaluable to persons who suffer periodically
from toothache, sensitiveness of the teeth and
gums,decay and offensive breath, for by using a few
drops in a little water to rinse the mouth daily,
they will not only never suff er again, but will pre-
serve their teeth sound and white to the end. That
with the Bed is for children’s use.

The monkeys are gradually wcrki> g their

A smart man down South did a shrewd
deal in the dog-line the other day. He sold a
mongrel he had to a traveller at a good figure, on
the guarantee that he was one of the best carrying
dogs this side of the lino Alter the bargain was
struck and the coin planked down, the buyer inci-
dentally remarked, ”Oh, by liio way. whatd' es he
carry best?” The seller grinned as h® drily re-
plied, " Faith, then. I think about the test and
only thing he can carry is a moighty big pack of
fleas.” And then he dodged a junk of road-metal,
and scooted with his dog-money to the nearest

An English paper asserts that belief in
witchcraft has by mo raenna died out In England.
It constantly receives letters, mainly from Somer-
setshire, from parties averring that they are
“witched,” and that, though they have tried all
sorts of charms, such as t urning herbs in i heir
bedroom, nailing a nail In the footprint of the
person who is supposed to havu witched taem,
drawing the blood of the witch with a pin, &o.,
they can’t exorcise the “ crittur.” Hence, tney
seek advice from the omniscient editor, who ap-
peals to the parsons to tackle the evil. As, how-
ever, they’ll only shift them from one style of
demonology into another, we don’t see this advice
will achieve much good.
Another injustice to the worrukin’ mahn.
The other morning, Mrs. William Parks, of PJatts-
burg, Wallsend, gladdened the heart of her lord
by presenting him with three small Parks (two
boys and one girl). All are very much alive, and
three new perambulator manufactories are now
being erected in that thriving township. We
venture to think that a few more patriotic ladles
like Mrs. P. would do more to reduce that
Immigration vote than the mouthlngs of ail the
Hyde Park howlers put together. When Sir
Hercules reigned, an event like that of Plattsburg
generally eased his purse of a “tenner.” Gussy,
however, would bo more interested in a two-
headed chick, or a clutch of thirty-six long eared,
bob-tailed Brahma-Pootras. Every man has his
cwn particular taste.
We don’t know more of Mr. Prendergast
than what we have read about him in the papers,
but if his only fault be that of anxiety to sow
dissatisfaction in the hearts ot bis fellow men—
whether they be immigrants at the Barracks or
Darling Pointers simmering in iheir own grease -
why, then, we would bid him go on and prosper as
a preacher of dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction is
the mother of reform, just a* scepticism is the
mother of progress, J ust as scepticism is an
abomination to the ignorant, because it disturbs
their lazy and complacent minds, because it trou-
bles their cherished superstitions, because it im-
poses on them the tatigue of inquiry, so dissatis-
faction is an abomination to those who batten on
the social inequalities of the status quo, and for the
same reasons If dissatisfaction-sower Prender-
gast is to be kept out of the hiring-room, fair plav
demands that Messrs. Pangloss and Candide should

The Rev. A. J. Wade sawed air in the
Coburg (Vic.) Public Hall, and among a lot of
declarations of the splendidly assertive kind, as-
sured the audience of his competence to pose as
an authority on tho Drink question, in the follow-
ing words: “ 1 nave never known the taste ot in-
toxicating drink, and I'll never stop while I have
breath waging war against it.” The construction
here is not very happy. If the first sentence be a
statement of iact, it indicates that the Kev. Wade
js inordinately rash In undertaking to wage war
while he has breath. It is evident that ho doesn’t
know wh«t he is waging about. When rdormed
drunkards inveigh against liquor the objec-
tion that they took too much of it naturally
enough suggests itself. But when men who
don’t know anything at all about it inveigh
against it, a still more fatal objection is
evoked. The only apostle who dtesrves the ear of

This is a tale from the far North, that
happy land of explorers, alligators, snalk-juice
and push apostles, and it concerns a popular
Native Police official who, on being removed to
another district had his [esthetic soul blasted with
the usual illuminated address and n “puss” of
thirty soverigns. That night, a crowd of his boon
companions and well-wishers in general, gathered
together in the best room of the “Sundowner’s
Best,” and the grog doings that followed hive
never been equalled since the night that King
Balthazar “gif a barty.” Asa natural sequence,
the caboodle of the revelleis (including the testi-
monial recipient) were sprawled on the floor
before midnight, and there they slept the sleep of
the just and properly corned till morning. The
grey-eyed morn was smiling on the frowning
ight, checkering the eastern clouds with streaks
of light, and th“ refreshing soda, with a stick in it,
vns at a premium, when the company awoke, not
only to the beauties of the coming day, but also
to the solemn fact that some one bad run the rule
over the lot and cased them of everything worth
nhitting. The " Native ” himself, not only lost his
presentation bag and its contents, but £20 of his
*»lary besides, and the only thing left, to console
him for his loss was the shattered wreck of thj
“loominaytid testimonial.”
' few days ago a fine fat wild turkey took
a stroll slong the Narrabri recreation ground, and
was quietly admiring the surrounding scenery
when the alarm was given, and a gallant band of
the town sports started off to resist the bold in-
truder. Nineteen shots were fired at a range of
about 20 yards, and after each shot, the stranger
gracefully bowed his acknowledgments, and
begun to hump himself around in a style that
plainly showed he mistook these hostile proceed-
ings lor a spontaneous ovation, got up in honour
of his visit. \ council of war was then hell. and
It was finally decided to telegraph to a neighbour-
ing township lor a loan of its brass band, to scare
The feathered desperado off; but as the musicians
refused to risk thoir lives, another firing party was
organised, and sallied out to shift the enemy.
v orty rounds were then fired, and it was seriously
feared that if the deadly warfare were carried on
much longer, a new sky would soon be required
for the whole of the Northern district. More am-
munition was sent for, and the sickening carnage
was about to begin again, when a one-armed
Irishman, who swears he carried a pike in ’98,
walked up and broke the biped’s hind leg with a
bneb-bat, alter which it was run down and lodged
an the local look-up. We expect great things from
our Northern sharp-shooters, when the cannons
boom, and the sabres clash, and the trumpet calls
“to arms.” Especially if the enemy stands half a
tnlKi to the right or left of the spot where the
sharp-shooters aim at.
“ What are we doing for our black brud-
ders ?” Is a Htatc conundrum which receives som«*
extremely miscellaneous sorts of answers. In this
colony, we give our blacking-bottle relative a
gorgeous blanket once a year, and this blanket;
generally meets all his requirements for about,
half-an-hour, after which the Government brand
is hacked out, the two untarnished pieces sewn
together, and the whole traded off for a ginger-
beer bottle of three-star snaik-Juice. Up North,
the nigger affords a pleasing change to the mono-
tony of potting kangaroos and alligators, and the
news of a darkles’ camp being pitched near a
sporting town produces as much excitement as
the suddon arrival of a buffalo herd would cause
to a tribe of half-starved Comanche Indian braves.
They do quite a deal for their black brudders up
there—at a range of 500 yards. Down South, it
would appear that the most strenuous efforts are
now being made to prevent the ink-bottle blood
of the lords of the soil from drying up altogether;
for, from recent official returns, we find that out
of 85 inmates of the Lake Hiudmarsh co-called
“Aboriginal ” Mission Station, no less than 70 are
half-castes. Various scientific theories, such as
the Java earthquake dust, the unusual number of
snots on the sun, the return of thegresn potato
bug plague, &o., have been put forward to account
for this unseemly bleaching on the part of the de-
scendants of Chanaan; but the most probable ex-
planation is that of a young Croajingolong gio,
who, on being asked why her latest addition to the
census was a sort of mealey-brown, replied, “Oh,
me bln eat it too much ptlour long a Mass’r Char-
ley’s station." And now Berry, across the border.
Is getting full up of this “ pflour’’-eating business,
and in his latest official utterance he says that
in the future none but pure undiluted blacks,
warranted not to fade, will be received on these
Mission runs, and he will at once take steps to
work the half-castes now on them out into the
world, and provide employment for them. “ Out
into the world ” is good, but, so far as past experi-
ence goes, all we have ever done for our saddle-
coloured.andcharcoal>rudders is to work them out
of the world, which is quite a different style of pro-
ceeding altogether.
“Low sensationalism, by tap-room touts,”
is the awfully blasphemous stylo in which tne
Orange Liberal, alludes to the tea-graph t-ues
and “our own correspondents ” ot the kvfig
Ooze, and the cause of the trouble Is simply this.
A few evenings back, a startling “wire” in the
veracious journal alluded to announced that a dis-
graceful street fight took place in Orange between
two beastly-intoxicated young girls, and “the
origin ofthefight was that one o f the gi rls charged
the other with having kept company with a police-
man to whom the girl was engaged to be married.”
As this was the first intimation of the battle that
the people of Orange received, the whole town-
ship was at once thrown into a state of intense
excitement, and there was some talk of decorating
the numbers av th’ foorce with fowls’ plumage
and tar, and riding them round the town on a rail
amidst a gorgeous display of Celestial fireworks.
It was soon discovered, however, that the whole
story was an Infamous and filthy fabrication,
started by one of those brilliant geniuses who are
ever willing to do gratuitous we k for the enter-
prising proprietors of the Nooze, in the hopes of
one day being honoured with the glorious title of
“our own correspondent.” When the truth of
this was established, it was suggested that the
attentions of the men w'th the tar and feathers
be turned to the gutter-raker who sent the “wire;”
but the good sense of the majority of the insulted
pointed out that nothing could make the origi-
nator of the libel more dsspicable than he
naturally was. and no they agreed with the
Libeual, that “after all, this was about the exact
style ot information that might be expected from
a person who finds it easier to hover about tap-
rooms for inspiration as to current events, rather
than to take a tour through the district for the
purpose of reporting upon the evidences of mate-
rial advancement in every direction apparent,
whether in agricultural, mining, or commercial
pursuits.” And so the matter ended with a part-
ing shot, which said, “ It is a poor travelling re-
porter that cannot afford to pay for what he eats
and drinks in any district which he may have to
visit, and a poor journal that has to resort to such
services.” Such a scathing rebuke would cause
even a Damley Island mummy to squirm, and
could only be deserved by one journal, and by
one scribbler—the Even Ooze and its Orange cor-
respondent.
Whatever may be said about the proceed-
ings of our representatives in the Council Cham-
bers, we are pleased to hear that their “ carryings-
on ” in the refreshment-room are such as we have
a right to ex pect from an Intelligent and decorous
body of gentlemen. We remember the days when
the doings in the stomach-solacing department of
our Legislative Assembly would bring a blush of
?A ame b r °nzed cheek of a Kent-street
forty ’or a tinned sardine. At the time we
speak of, one of the most irrepressible members of
the House was a lineal descendant of “ a rale owid
King av Munster,” and for the present we’ll
suppose his name was Fogarty. Fogarty, by the
way, had an unbounded respect and admiration
for Fogarty, and whenever he let off one of his
bombastic orations, he would shake hands with
himself for the rest of the sitting, and go hopping
around on the fish for compliments. One Eight,
he made a terrific two-hour speech on the Land
Bill, during the course of which he ripped into the
reigning Government of the time in a style calcu-
lated to up-end thufsoul of every member present.
Then he skipped off to the refresh, and took his
seat by the side of Senator Noseblossom, who had
been very much x’ th’ sun that day, and who was
sobering up on a plate of oysters. “ Tryer plashe
f utters, Fogarty ?” said the tired politician. “No,”
replied Fogarty; “but I’ll jine ye in a cup av
kartee. So the one supped and the other scooped,
until finally the compliment-fisher enquired, “Oi
say, Misthur Noseblossom, did y’ hear that oi jhist
made wan av th’ gratest spaches thathez iver been
made since th’ days av Wmtwirth?” “Well, I
dunno ’bout zhat,” said the oyster-punisher, “ but
I heard a f’ler uo ’ere jes now shav you wash mat-
in' er b fool ’f yerself as u&hil.” “ O, oi thank
y ,f u I y er Impertlnts, y dhirty, low basthe,”
yelled Fogarty; “shure it sarves me roight fur
demamin’ meself be tarkin’ t’ th’ loikes av you.
so it does.” And then the insulted patriot tur ed
his back to old Noseblossom, and started a brisk
conversation with another member who was
sampling a plate of “sandwidges.” All this time
the hon. member for Rumjungie was falling asleep
over his bivalvular victims, and muttering away
to himself, “Y'know, Fogarty, yer too hot—too
fernally hot allergether. F’ler mush keep cool, ’f
wantsh (hie) shucksheed Parl’mlnt.” And so he
gabbled on, until at last he so thoroughly con-
vinced himself that Fogarty required cooling that
he got; hold of a large chili-vinegar bottle, and,
Staggering to his feet, poured the whole contents
over the bald head of Fogarty, just as that gentle-
man was in the middle of a glowing description of
how the country would boom IE he was only
elected Premier. Head, beard, shirt, and every
other visible part of the gifted senator were
drenched, as hs sprang to his feet, and, putting
himself in a Slogger Sullivan attitude, yelled;
Put up yer hands, y’ dhrunkia son av a brewery,
or Oi’li athrike y’ whare y’ are. Howiy St.
Path rick 1 t’think Oi’d live f see th’ dav Oi’d be
pickled loike a sanguinary ister by a feller wid a
nose loi’ko a biled lobstir. vvmhoooo! take him
away, some wan, or, be Jabers, Oi’ll—Oi’ll-Oi’ll
ate ’im /” So they took him away, and, next nignt
the insulted and insulter were found quietly plav*
ing a friendly game of “ Nap.” together for three-
penny pools. It is, indeed, a matter for congratu-
lation to find that such scenes as the above are
never—well, hardly ever—to be seen in these days
VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Lament for the Victorian Bar-loafers.
The word has gone forth, and the restaurant’s
glory
Must fade, by and bye, to a decorous gloom,
When, no more shall lovers—both youthful and
hoary—
By Hebe’s soft glances be lured to their doom.
The coy, charming creatures, who smile as they
serve- us.
Or blush in response to an amorous leer.
Must go, giving place to stern barmen (preserve
us I).
Wno’ll grunt a reply as we order our boor.
Those fairies that held us enthralled with their
beauty.
The while whisky bottle and bitters they passed.
And weaned married men from the missus and
duty.
Will soon be but visions and dreams of the past.
Instead of gold tresses, and trinkets, and rustle
Of flounces and skirts, at the back of the ba**,
Busby whiskers, and waistcoats, and shirt-sleeves,
and bustle,
Will loom through the smoke of our soothing
cigar.
Alas for the cUrks ! bringing roses in bunches,
To gladden the hearts ot the maids they admire.
And whisp’ring false vows as they swallow their
lunches—
Too soon will the days of bar-courtship expire ;
The limp Civil servant, whoso figure so slender
Is wont for support on the counter to lean,
Wtrle he pesters poor Hebe with jokes that offend
her,
Will die when “the deaha” disappear from the
scene.
The bald city swell who now drops in sedately
Through snug private door, for a “sherry ” and
spoon,
Will miss the last p irt of the business—oh,greatly I—
The barmaid to him is a blessing and boon :
For, pressing her palm as he tenders his shilling.
He lives, for the moment, his youth o’er again—
While she, like a good-hearted damsel’s unwilling
His dream to dispel, be it never so vain.
The flash, florid “bookie”.(“ fly ” bird of ill omen)
The “hactor”—clean - shaved, and with big
bottled nose —
Who love to give barmaids some fancy cognomen.
And pass rude remarks on their figures and
clothes,
Will find themselves robbed of such pet recrea-
tions
When Hebe returns to her pa and her ma—
(Still the pros , you can bet, won’t decline invita-
tions
To drink though there be but a man at the bar).
Yes, the word has gone forth from the Royal Com-
mission,
That Hebe, dear girl I must be banished for aye.
So, ’spite of our sorrow, we ll bow in submission,
And strive to bestifle our sobs as we say—
“Good-bye to the old happy hours that have seen
us
Fall weak, Trilling victims to Cupid's keen
darts —
When the worship of Bacchus was worship of
Venus.
And taking our “lotion” meant losing our
hearts.”
OLD GENTLEMAN: “AND WHO REIGNED AFTER SAUL?”
GOOD BOY: “ DAVID.”
O. O.: “AND WHO CAME AFTER DAVID?”
O. B.: “SOLOMON”
O. G.: “AND WHO CAME AFTER SOLOMON?”
SHARP LITTLE GIRL: “OH, PLEASE, SIR, THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.”

AYER’S PILLS
A large proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange*
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes:
“Ayer’s Pills are invaluable to me, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physic
I have ever found. It is a pleasure to me to
speak in their praise, and I always do so
when occasion offers.
W. L. Page, of W. L. Page & Bro.”
Franklin St., Richmond,Va., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine.
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. HAYES.”
Mexia, Texas, June 17,1882.
The Rev. Francis B. Harlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Ga., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
Inconvenience, until some months ago I
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health.”
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

PIG-HUNTING.
A REMEMBRANCE.
The other day a man was attacked and
killed by wild pigs at Walroa, New Zealand. And
this just reminds us of the first time we ever went
pig-bunting. It was near Blenheim, N.Z., and
amongst the party of four was an explorer, a
bushman, and the wildest tame Irishman that had
ever been sent out from home. “ Pwhat the dlvil
do yees want wld the guns an’ dogs ? ” Of course
we told him that they were quite necessary for the
business of catching and killing wild pigs. “ Be-
forra,” said Pat, “ I can catch and howld any
loomin’ pig that ever wore brusseis. Pat had
never seen a wild pig, and so the rest of the party
exchanged winks all round, and said nothing.
Finally we reached a patch of the tl-tree through
which the pigs had worn trails large enough to
admit of their passage. It was a dead moral cer-
tainty—20 to 1 offered, with no takers-that there
were pigs in that patch of scrub. So we stationed
Fat at one of the holes and sent the dog's in at the
other side. Pat’s last remark was “ Bejaysus, I U
howld any bloomin’ pig that pokes his nose out av
this hole. There he st od, like a wicket-keeper
waiting for a ball. He hadn’t long to wait. Out
rushed an old boar with tusks on him six inches
long, and, dashing between the Irishman s legs,
threw him twenty feet away. Quicker than a cat
Pat was on his feet again and shinning up a gum-
tree like a ’possum with a boy after It. Of course
the pig didn’t climb up after Patrick, but when
it had gone far enough away and been killed,
Pat come down. “Why dldn t you hold him,
Pat?” we asked. “Howld the dlvil 1' said Pat.
•• Shure It’s not a pig at all; it’s a rhinoceros. It
was our time to laugh then, but Pat’s turn oame
in the course of the day. We had wandered half a
mile away from the rest of the party, botanlslng,
or because the flask was too small to share ail
round, or something, when a hog about the size ox
an elephant hove in sight. We seized our rifle,
took deliberate aim, and fired in one time and two
motions. Down dropped the monster of the
Jungle, and, dropping our smoking rifle where wo
stood, we rushed up to stab him in the gills and
let the claret out of him. We were just bending
over to get in our bloody work, when the con-
founded pig opened its left eye and winked at us
just once. Then he got up on his feet, and the
next thing we knew we were at the bottom of the
hill bruised and bleeding, and altogether out of
sorts with our paternal ancestors for bringing us
into the world at all if they hadn’t any more brains
to spare than they had put into our head. When
we regained our feet, to our consternation we
found that the ferocious brute had gone and laid
down beside our gun. Then we scolded our parents
still more; and even the thought that there must
bo one fool In every family didn’t console us for
the thought that in our haste and excitement we
had neglected to re-load our rifle and take it with
us. We waited around there until dusk for that pig
to die. The boys kept “ oooeing ” for us every
once In a while, but we said nothing. Yes we did,
too. We said a prayer for the repose of that pig s
sou 1 , and hoped that it would soon go to it. But
the contrary scamp wouldn’t do it. Night came
on, and we knew our friends were getting anxious.
What if they should go home and leave us alone in
the wilderness with that pig. Still we wouldn t
“ cooey ” back. Not for a bucketful of champagne.
By ana bye, a little sense came to us. We dou t
know whore we got It from, but suspect we must
have absorbed it from the pig. At any rate, he
knew more than we did In the outset, and had held
his own remarkably well. But, as we were saying,
a little sense oame to us, and we went and out a
bundle of flax. Then we tied the stalks together
and made a rope about sixty feet long. New Zea-
land flax, you know, is stronger than the lye that
some of our exchanges are in the habit of washing
their rollers with. Anyway, we made a slip nooze
on one end of this rope and crawled cautiously up
behind the sleeping pig. It was a moment such as
we had not experienced since we one time asked a
parson for his daughter. We dldn t get the
daughter, but if you’ll wait a little you’ll find out
that we got the pig. By means of a long forked
stick, that we had sense enough by this time to out,
we managed to slip that noose over one of the
pig’s hind legs. Then we went back to a fern tree
about twenty yards away, and began yanking on
the rope. At first the pig only grunted and shook
his tall, as much as to say, “Goway, fly, don t
bodder me.” Pretty soon he got annoyed and
turned round to see what was the matter
with himself, anyhow. Naturally his eye fol-
lowed down along the line until he saw us.
Then he began telling us that*? we dldn t let go of
bis leg and climb that tree tfc’d see about ft, or
words to that effect. HeJ|Sed so fast that he
frothed at the mouth. Andvlo he came upon us.
Hastily drawing home the nne for about twenty
feet wo made a lightning half-hitch, and lit out.
Our enemy followed, until he got away past the
tree, and all at once came to a halt. That s what
they call stringhalt in pigs, we believe. At any
rate, he came to a halt, and we made a wide detour
to get our gun. We knew that the pig couldn t
get within twenty feet of us, and chuckled at the
thought that we would leisurely load the weapon
and fill him so full of bullets that his hide would
look like a sieve for cleaning corn. To our dis-
may, when wo arot back to about the place we had
left our rifle, there lay another pig, with our rifle
In front of him. Now. we’ll leave it you if that
wasn’t discouraging. However, we went baokto
the flax patch and cut a fresh lot of flax. We
made another rope, and a longer one, for we bad
to utllize'a tree In a different direction from the
other one. and it stood further away. As we were
making the second rope, we began to think that
we’d have to chain up all the pigs in Blenheim be-
fore we could get at that gun. We managed to
fasten the noose around this monster’s leg without
accident, and hurriedly slipped away for fear the
savage barking of the other brute would wake
him up. Finally, we began to pull on the line. Not
a sound. We braced ourself against the tree, and
yanked until we bit the end of our liver off be-
tween our front teeth. Then a night-mare thought
flashed across us. The pig was dead. He was the
one we had shot at, and wo had tied his brother up
in mistake. A little investigation showed that our
suspicions were corroet. Then we walked boldly
up, loaded our rifle, and murdered the brother in
cold blood. The boys were around us in a few
seconds, and then Pat had his revenge._ *‘ Bejaysus,
Misther,” said he, “ ye musht be a foine marks-
man, when ye have to l ie a pig up to a three before
ye can shoot him at all.”
In referring to a second edition of the
Woolloomooloo outrage, brought off in a suburb
of the “Queen Cfty of the South,” the Melbourne
D.T. specially deplores the fact that it happened on
a Sunday. Says the Presbyterian organ “ But
three weeks before, the Day of Rest had been
desecrated by the brutal murder of a woman in
the same neighbourhood. Last Sunday saw the
inhabitants horror-stricken over an even more re-
volting occurrence.” That par. gives one the im-
pression that the D.T. regards murder as playing
quite a second fiddle to “desecration of the Saw-
bawth,” and that the man who picks on the first
day of the week for disposing of his missus throws
away his last chance of redemption. A popular
" nigger ” ditty used to tell us
“ Never get born on a Friday—
Choose some other day if you can.”
And we remember being deeply impressed with
the advice. We weuld, in our turn, like to warn
ruffians in general against the danger of allowing
their victims to be killed on a Sunday, and suggest
to them the propriety of “choosing some other
day if they can.’ —
8AWBAWTH DESECRATION.
If murder and outrage must needs be committed,
At least there is certainly one day
When crimes of that nature should not be per-
mltted , A _ , .
(Of course, we’re referring to Sunday)—
So whoa rascals fall foul of some creature ill-
fa te^i»
They will please bear in mind Mrs. Grundy,
And take oare that the Sawbawth Is not desecrated
(Let them put off the murder till Monday)*
For a neat little send-off in the way of an
obituary notice, a recent ad. la the Tamwortii
Nitwr takes the lead. Full t araculars of the de-
ceased are first given, and then the trouble burets
forth as follows:—” Blessed are the dead which die
In the Lord. What Majesty is there In the Chris-
tian’s death! What a glory in her hope! As the
rivers roll the smoothest the nearer they approach
the ocean; as the rose smells the sweetest when
dying; as the sun appears the most glorious when
setting; so it is with the Christian. Armidale,
Gunnedab, and Inverell papers please copy.” Bar-
ring the time-honoured, but for all that,
bad grammar of the “ which,” we venture to think
the above knocks Alfred’s charnel-house poet
completely over the ropes in the first round, but
we fail to see why Armidal®, Qunnedah. and ln-
verell should receive special mention. There are
Christians (of a certain kind) even at Bourke, and
Burra-burramatugery. Not many, we admit, but
still there are some; and it seems hard that they
are not invited to roll as smooth and smell as
sweet, and set as glorious as those on the M Intyre
and Namol.
The Rum must have kissed the baby with
a little extra emotion prior to inditing that famous
par. anent “the infamous system of employing
barmaids,” “It is so frightfully destructive of
human virtue, so desolating, even when existing
in the smallest dimensions, th«t it must be totally
abolished.” It is this kind of excited tomfoolery,
clamouring for legislative paternalism, that does
such a lot of harm. Human virtue wouldn’t be
appreciably increased by legal enactments com-
pelling publicans to employ ugly-mugged old
men in lieu of fascinating Hebes. The reform
that is needed must come from within, not from
without. Parliament these next ten years or
more would be far more wisely employed in re-
pealing old laws than in enacting new ones. JV.oie
than half the evils that threaten human virtue are
the direct result of hypocritical legis atlon.
Pale-blue silk is employed for this youthful
toilette, the skirt being ornamented with flowers
made by the sewing-machine, and sewn on a
long plain robing, cut out in long Vandy ke points
below, and patterned with the flowers just men-
tioned, completed by a kilting set under and
rising on one side to the skirt-band gives _ the
skirt trimming. The scarf drapery is joined
below by plain pleated breadths extending to
the hem of the skirt; a flehu bertha, crossed in
front, of stuff and lace, four inches wide, finishes
the bodice, with lace sleeves.
A dark-red satin petticoat shines through the
airy Chantilly lace of which this charming toi-
lette is made. The flounces are about fourteen
inches deep, the skirt being finished below with
a silk balayeuse. For the hind drapery, falling
down in a short draped point, a lace scarf is
employed. An apron trimming, composed of a
pleated satin stripe, and caught together, as seen,
with bows and feathers, ornaments the front of
the skirt from the peak to the lowest flounce, the
bodice being finished to correspond.
