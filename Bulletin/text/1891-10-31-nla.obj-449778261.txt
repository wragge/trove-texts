large—from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tenuis Lawns,

the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three

Dr. Perry’s Pamphlet on Nervous Diseases:
Their a usb, Symptoms, and Treatment.
This pamphlet is specially written to show a method of
counteracting the ill effects of indiscretions in early life,
over-work, mental worry, &c., and contains a fund of use-
ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz : —Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS
DEBILITY, Pains in the Back, Defective Memory, Specks
before the Eyes, Excessive Nervousness, Premature
Decay, Bashfulness, Excessive Heart Palpitation, Des-
pondency, Impure Blood, Liver and Kidney Complaints,
Contagious Diseases, and various other symptoms experi-
enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guarantee a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
f invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
become perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful ihethods of affecting their cure.
ALL CONSULTATIONS, either by letter or in person, FREE. Hours of Consultation—From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
daily; Saturdays, 10 to 12 a.m.; and from 7to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Address all letters —

The Cheapest Freetrader on Earth.
The Freetrade system is admittedly a system
of Free Competition. So f<ar, in reality,
there is no Freetrade and no absolutely Free
Competition in any civilised land, but it is
the boast of England and its servile imitator,
New South Wales, that they approach as
near to it as circumstances will admit. They
are both in an embryotic state, so far as
their fiscal arrangements are concerned, but
in the latter country, at all events, the
fanatics of political economy see, or profess to
see, a financial millennium ahead—a halcyon
period when the products of all countries
will be admitted free of duty to Australian
ports, and all the world will compete with
this nation on equal terms. Then the wine
industry must go and the vines be rooted up
unless the New South Wales vigneron will
be content to toil as cheaply as the labourers
of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Brazil, for the
consumer always buys the cheapest article,
and cheapness of production depends almost
entirely upon cheapness of labour. Then
tobacco cultivation will be suspended, and
the hitherto protected dairying industry will
die and be buried, and all the other trades
at present supported by tariffs levied in an
alleged Freetrade land must either work on
a cheaper basis than their competitors—or
else close up. The one absolutely reliable
fact about the Freetrade system is that the
cheapest producer must come uppermost
and the rest must go to the wall. It is this
cheapness which is the stock argument of all
Freetraders. The farmer is always told of a
golden age when he will get cheap machinery
from Europe, ana thus ruin the local imple-
ment-maker ; and the implement-maker is
told of a glorious time approaching when he
will get an abundance of cheap foreign grain
from India, and thus wipe out the farmer.
The tailor hears that the local bootmaker is
his enemy, because his boots are dearer than
the imported article, and the bootmaker is
warned of the evils of the other man because
his products are more costly than the
shoddy of Manchester. To every separate
individual the ta e is told of how he can get
cheap, slave-made goods from abroad, and
thereby avoid the extortions of —and thus
practically abolish —some other local indivi-
dual, and as the other individual has to
make his profit in like manner by abolishing
him, Freetrade —as applied to Australia—is
practically the doctrine of universal aboli-
tion. For only the cheapest man can
survive under the regime of the Freetrade
prophet, and as the Australian is about the
most expensive worker on earth he must go,
no matter who stays.
» * #
The Australian is about the most expen-
sive labourer on earth —the Chinaman is
probably the most inexpensive. The two
men occuny the extieme ends of the
industrial scale. . , So far, the struggle.
between the Mongol and the Freetrader of
New South Wales has not even commenced,
for the former has been busily employed
wiping out competitors nearer home. The
cheap Englishman gained a hold upon his
country forty years ago, in the days when
the son of Confucius knew practically
nothing of commerce, manufactures, or
arts, and the Chinaman had to extinguish
this intruder in his own land before he could
compete to much advantage in mote distant
regions. At present the work is proceeding
gaily. The Buddhist has learned only the
rudiments of industrial science, but already,
by virtue of the great Freetrade axiom by
which the dearest is taken and the cheapest
is left, the Briton is going fast. The model
English mercantile man in Shanghai—the
one who knows three or four languages and
is competent to take complete charge of a
large trading business—demands some £6OO
per annum ; the Chinese merchant has an
equally capable and equally intelligent
manager who receives £3O a year, his rice,
and the privilege of a shake-down in the
warehouse. The Chinese clerk and store-
man receives food, clothes, and the use of a
hard bunk, but wages, in his case, are
altogether omitted. The wealthy Chinese
merchant—the boss of the establishment —
lives anyhow, after the fashion of a pig.
“ This process is going on all over China,”
writes an American trader who once did an
immense business in Shanghai. “White
men employed and taught the Chinese and
the Chinese drove them out. We could no
more compete with them than we could over-
come death and fate.” The British Free-
trader in the Mongolian ports is just be-
ginning to realise the meaning of his own
doctrine of Free Competition, and the result
is about the most surprising thing that ever
happened to him.
» • •
The real merits of the Asiatic whom —in
the alleged Freetrade millennium—thepeople
of New South Wales must undersell if they
wish to save their industries from utter ex-
tinction, are only beginning to be under-
stood. He is a strange, untiring individual,
who seldom rests, and hardly ever sleeps,
and to whom recreation is an unknown
quantity. In the Chinese laundries of New
York and San Francisco work is never sus-
pended. Night and day the Mongol pursues
his ceaseless toil of, “ washee-washee-wash.”
For twenty hours per diem the same tireless
heathen labours at the tub, and for the
remaining four he sleeps among the soiled
linen, so that he may save the rent of sleep-
ing accommodation and the wear and tear of
bedding. In the underground haunts of
Chicago he turns his leprous kinsmen into
cash, and there night and day the diseased
wretches make cheap cigars which are after-
wards labelled as Havannahs and Manillas,
and sold in all parts of the world—in the
fashionable clubs and hotels of Sydney among
the rest. There is much solid economy
about the men who will make their dying
relatives toil for sixteen hours or more per
day, in exchange for rice and the shelter of
a subterranean cavern, and the New South
Wales citizen must learn to chain up his
consumptive friends and his crippled rela-
tions in a cell, and turn them into similar
sources of revenue, if he hopes to compete on
a Freetrade basis. For there are no out-
ward evidences to show that there have been
dead bodies among the choice Havannahs,
and that a noisome corpse got mixed some-
how with the fragrant Manillas ; and anyhow
the question is one of cheapness, not of
corpses, and on a solid Freetrade system the
manufacturer who runs a staff of unpaid
lepers in a dungeon can easily keep ahead.
• • «
In fifty years, at the present rate of pro-
gress, China can manufacture for the whole
world. There is nothing extravagant in
this assertion. With modern machinery—
to say nothing of the machinery that will
exist in another half-century—a nation which
now numbers, say, 350,000,000, and which
is willing to work for 16 hours per diem, can
manufacture everything which can possibly
be wanted by the world’s population, and
much more besides. Therefore, whbrever
the Freetrade system prevails, the China-
man, as the cheapest worker on earth, can
wipe out and utterly extinguish every com-
petitor, and leave whole nations unem-
ployed. What he will be as a manufacturer
in the future can be guessed by what he is,
as an agriculturist, in the present. There is
no such patient* and laborious toiler on the
surface of the globe.
In China the owner of land who should not cultivate it
would he deprived of it. Fertilizers undreamed of in
Europe are used there, and the nostrils of a European or
an American are assailed with all sorts of odours at
every turn in city and country. All ordure is penuriously
hoarded and used. Every stalk of rice is planted as
seed, and replanted in water by human hands, and to
add one handful to a crop would not be thought un-
worthy of effort. Rain water is everywhere stored in
ponds or in water-holes for irrigation, anil in all casts
fish are grown in these reservoirs. Human hands do all
the work ; human backs bear most of the land burdens ;
human animals are the beasts that drag most of the loads,
where they cannot be transported on canal or river.
Horses, cows anil sheep are crowded out; they would
cost more than they would produce. Why should a
horse or an ass be called to bear a burden when there are
poor human beasts to bo. hail, in number sulticient to
build the pyramids or to drag mountains from their
bases, if the poorest of wages to recompense such a task
were forthcoming? There are practically no plant weeds
to be seen in the most thickly populated parts of China.
There is no room for them, anil they are completely extir-
pated in a land where agriculture is so minute that the
roots of plants are examined to expel or to kill any insect
or grub that would date to dispute a living with the
hungry lord of creation. Seeds are steeped in liquid
manure to force them to rapid and luxuriant growth.
Fertilizers are applied directly to the roots of plants, and
not placed on the surface of the land as with us, for in
the latter process is evaporation and waste. Man is (he
only weed tolerated in China, and he teems everywhere.
A population of S(K) to the square mile is not uncommon
in the best agricultural districts there.
When the biography of some individual,
who has built up a fortune by his own
unaided efforts, is written as a bright and
shining example for the coming generations,
the story of his rise is almost always the
same. He got ahead of his fellow-men at
the outset by abject economy—by living in
squalor and discomfort—by incessant toil,
and by abandoning almost everything which
makes life pleasant. But all these things
are comparative terms ; he was simply more
toilsome, more economical, and more squalid
than the rest of his kind, and if they had
unanimously discovered and resorted to a
still lower depth of meanness and economy,
then he must have i/escended to *a lower
level even than they—«or else have lived and
died a poor man, and a failure. The mil-
lionaire who made his first rise by wearing
old clothes would have been left behind in
the scramble for wealth by a race of compe-
titors as energetic as himself who wore no
clothes at all; the individual who earned
the first beginnings of his capital by
selling old horse-shoes picked up on the
highway and hoarding up the proceeds,
would have been regarded as an ex-
travagant spendthrift in a community
where his fellows all devoted themselves to
scraping up fertiliser from the gutters, and
turning it into cash; and he would have
gone the way of spendthrifts in general and
been a shocking example to all posterity.
The Chinaman is the model economist of the
earth, and the only reason why he has not
yet grown rich is that he is surrounded by
350,000,000 human beings as hideously
economical as himself. The successful
economist is a person who trades on the
extravagances of others, and in all China
there is no extravagant individual or class
to trade upon. But if the Mongol comes
fairly into competition with any white
nation, as he only can do under Freetrade
principles, then he will inevitably suck the
life-blood of his rivals. For as the most
grasping of Hebrew money-lenders is to the
most lavish member of the “juggins” order,
so is the educated Chinaman to the Hebrew
money-lender himself. It is a problem of
simple proportion, and the answer is easy.
* * *
The race that works most incessantly,
that does without most “necessaries,'’ and
that hangs on hardest to the proceeds, must
ultimately come uppermost on a Freetrade
basis, and the man from the shores of the
Yellow Sea fills the bill in all three in-
stances. He can dispense with light, air,
rest, and recreation, and almost with clothes
as well. He can sleep standing, or doubled
up in a cask, or crammed into a packing-case
with his naked feet propped against a nail.
He can travel in a fetid junk, piled up in a
heap, like dead meat. In California he is
ousting the white farmer and fruitgrower by
the simple process of paying from
two up to ten times as much for
the land as they can afford to offer, and
even then he realises larger profits than the
Aryan ever did. He is absorbing the fruit-
preserving industry by the same effective
methods, and the trail of the leper is over
the tinned peaches and pines and other
luxuries which the American mail-steamers
land so abundantly on these shores. He is
starting innumerable manufactures in his
own land, and already many of his products
are sold in New South Wales disguised under
English names. “As an industrial sup-
planter and trade absorber no nation of the
earth can equal his.” China has done more
in a quarter of a century to annex the
commerce and industries of the world
than any other land has accomplished
in a hundred years. And so long as
her products come in free it matters
nothing whether the Chinaman himself is
excluded or not ; the results are the same
whether the Mongol undersells his com-
petitors by goods manufactured on the spot,
or bv goods manufactured in his own Flowery
Land, and then exported. He can only be
dealt witli by two alternatives ; either he
must be shut out by protective tariffs, or he
must be competed with on even terms —
which means that his rival must become as
cheap, as squalid, as laborious, and as
miserably penurious as himself. The China-
man is an argument in favour of Protection
that cannot be overcome, even if all the
paper on earth is covered with Freetrade
logic, and all the shelves of all the libraries
in the globe groan under the burden of
tomes of Cobden’s philosophy.
“One Mighty Nation.”
Great is Diana of the Ephesians ! Greater is
the Allah of Anglo-Saxondorn, and the Times is
his prophet ! Listen, ye nations, for one speaks
as having authority, and not as the Jews ! ’Tis
the voice of the Cable that is heard in the land,
and he maunders dulcetly in this wise, and the
hearts of the Jingoes are glad, and the Anglo-
asses gather together at the street-corners of
Australian cities, and look exceeding wise and
are comforted: —“The Times, in a leading
article this morning, says that England and
Australia, no matter what reforms may result
from the piesent labour or other movements,
will always be part of the same mighty nation.”
Heigho ! and Alas ! but here tlni wish is father
to the thought, and there is no truth in either,
but much bunkum.
# # #
The mighty wheel of Time goes whirling
through Eternity in altogether different fashion
than, that affording prospect of “ everlasting-
ness ” to any nation or congeries of nations ;
and every dog, and every worm, and every
microbe, and every empire has its day—
and are not The great ocean of nothing-
ness is for ever dotted with transient
islands of apparent permanence for a brief
season, but the dissolving views of change
preserve not even a remembrance of their
shades. Nothing can die, says Lord Al-
mighty Tennyson, but lie answers his own
assertion in another poem in which he declares
that nothing can live ; and the musty annals of
history record only the mutations of empires,
and indicate but the possibility of remem-
brances of kingdoms age-long forgotten. The
tramp of the armies of Cyrus and Alexander
are mingled with those of Genghis Khan and
Hannibal and Caesar and Buonaparte, and
the last war between Turkey and Russia echoes
only the distant roar of eternal strife, and the
thunder of Plevna is only a little foam on the
crest of a time-wave in a mighty ocean which
stretches abroad into the farness of the un-
known. This Empire of England ! What is
it but a bulb-growth in a forest of mighty trees
whose forebears are now historical carbon
furnishing a little gas for present consumption.
Till the stars grow old, and the sun grows cold,
and the leaves of the judgment-book unfold, is
a point of time prophetic of the continuance of
only one empire—the empire of constant muta-
tion and unchangeable change.
* •
That which is born shall surely die ; and the
'Taw''holds"good both of empires and babies, and
ephemerae and apple-trees. In the great vast-
ness of eternity there is nothing good and noth-
ing evil ; for all good and all evil are merely
relative, and Nature only is. This little
England which so boastfully claims the God-
given dominion of the earth is herself but a sea-
dissevered bit of Europe. The Godwin Sands
mark a sunken earldom. The walls of the
Reculvers are eaten away, even within the
memory of man, by the salt brine of ocean, and
the fat earth of graveyards furnishes food of the
richest to the oysters that batten on the dead.
During the recent severe gales the sea ran high
along the coast, and Sandgate, a maritime town
in Kent, was well nigh inundated, the waves
encroaching upon the mainland, destroying the
alignment of streets and submerging the dwell-
ings. Canute’s empire was threatened in the
almost mythic days by this other conqueror
men call Neptune, and Victoria’s petty island
is a smaller realm by many a noble league.
But to the English mind, the infinitesimal
fraction of an infinite fraction of English soil
is vaster altogether than God’s great universe,
and the British half many million times greater
than the outlying eternal whole.
# # #
Men and nations endure just for so long as
they can endure ; just for so long as there is a
vital spark of endurance within them, and no
longer. All this hugger - mugging anent
grandeur and greatness and “everlasting”
empire syonymises a mighty fear, and heralds
to men the fact that the courage which is silent
because it is self-reliant has long fled, and a
base terror has taken its place in the national
heart. Editor Stead wrote recently in a ful-
some panegyric of Parkes, Rhodes, and Mac-
donald —(entitled, “ Three Empire Builders ”)
—that if Canada, Australia, and Africa set up
national house-keeping for themselves, then was
there an end for ever to the British Empire ; and
we answer yea, it is so. But, says Stead, and
the other fearsome Jingoes, this cannot be:
One speech ; one nation ; one destiny ! They
try to cheer themselves with the reiteration of
a possibility that looks not too probable. The
boy whistles with apparent bravery in the
dark—but it is only because he is shaking in
his shoes. Take up any recent English book
of biography, of fiction, of poetry —always
the same old song, always the same dreary,
wearying fetich— Nelson, the Goo-given hero
of England ; Wellington, a modern Alex-
ander, and what-not, and what-not, and what-
not. The challenge has become a scream, and
the courage of the true man is lost in the brag-
gart claims to courage of the shivering pol-
troon. Not thus Germany, not thus France,
not thus Russia—tor their day is not yet
come, nor the fruit ripe for plucking. But
England ?
# # #
It is a huge order, this “ eternal ” demand of
the Times for allegiance on our part. And
what good could we do England either, save to
serve as a cemetery for her effete sons when her
final hour has struck ? We are not, and cannot
be, England. As America is America, so are
we Australia, despite apparent similarity in a
few directions. There is no real identity
between us. We are rude, ignorant, barbarous,
uncultivated, unrefined, strong, self-resourceful,
standing erect in our own shoes. We know
nothing, and brutishly desire to know less. We
have no art, no literature, no architecture, no
traditions, no history, no social beauties or
amenities, no culture. England, on the contrary,
is polished, polite, learned, cultured, refined,
wealthy, weak, dubious, spineless and elegantly
decrepit. The English are versed in all know-
ledge—and all knavery. They know everything,
both of good and of evil, and life tb/them em-
braces every experience from organised philan-
thropy to the nameless abominations of Cleve-
land-street and Dublin castle, including the
charming peccadilloes of Tranby Croft. England
is the home of art and literature ; her glorious
land is filled with the achievements of Gothic
architect and slum-tenement builder ; her noble
history is stuffed with high-born outrage and
blue-blooded brutality ; her traditions glitter
with the sheen of swords in battle play ,-and are
sonorous with the clash of arms her social
manners and her social culture are of so high a
standard that men, when they consecrate their
lives to these elegant pursuits, have no time left
to be either human or honest; her women are
so beautiful and so delicately nurtured that only
American millionaires can afford to buy them ;
and she is, moreover, ruled by an aged lady
pre-eminent in grief, who has upwards of e'.evm
millions of money and whose offspring are so
numerous that hardly any high walk of life is
destitute of a right royal ornament and exemplar
for the encouragement and edification of a de-
voted following. Australia is so cursed and
England is so blessed, that any lasting (let
alone “everlasting”) union is impossible be-
tween them. Can you conceive Paradise chang-
ing locations with the Hall of Eblis ?
« « «
No! It cannot be —this eternal union
between England and Australia ! The former


country may be washed away by the sea, or
eaten piecemeal by Polish Jews and German
sweaters; she will disappear doubtless in a
blaze of many-tailed glory, consonant with her
high traditions, and her memories of Alfred
the Great, and Nelson, and other heroes, from
Henry V. to Albert Wettin ; but let her not
attempt to link her fate with that of a convict
colony whose grandfather wore a leg-chain and
whose highest intellectual effort to-day is
represented by the daily and w'eekly journalist,
of whom an English writer justly states his
nation’s opinion in these words : “ The pseudo-
intellectualism of the journalists (Australian)
with its harmful ignorance, or even more harm-
ful superficiality, is the wdll-o’-the-wisp offered
to the callow Australian intelligence as spiritual
companion and guide.” And further along the
same writer remarks that “culture” at
the Antipodes is in as bad a way as
“society,” and no good could possibly come
out of this Southern Nazareth. To all of
which we meekly bow our heads. We are
callow, and ignorant, and uncultured, very
aggressive and abominably arrogant, with
strength in our limbs and sap in our bodies, and
we yearn for neither part nor lot with the
superior person over the ocean, who has grown
so old and so weak-minded that she begins to
think that she is immortal. Youth and age are
bad yoke-fellows. One knows too much, and
the other may, perchance, ask too much. We
do not believe in the eternity of anything, least
of all in the permanence of the doddering grand-
motherly Empire upon which the sun is too tired
to set, and upon which he consequently never
rises. Until the stars grow old, and the sun
grows cold, and the leaves of the judgment
book unfold, and the fish of the ocean gnaw the
tombstones of British kings, and oysters wax
fat on the culture of the United Kingdom, and
the gentle crustacean meanders about the
traditions of England’s mighty past, and ghosts
and goblins gibber in the streets of Sydney ;
then, and not till then—if we live so long a
national life—will Australia worry about being
apart of the same “mighty nation” as the
little bit of land separated from Europe by the
“encroaching sea,” and coloured red on maps
of English manufacture.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Labour and Imperialism.
The proposition recently advanced by the
New South Wales Labour Party that a Labour
candidate should be run in opposition to Premier
Dibbs at the Murrumbidgee is another striking
evidence that the third section of the Assembly
badly wants a competent leader —or even an
incompetent one. For no leader, however
foolish, could well make so many mistakes as
can be accomplished by a caucus, and the
scheme of ousting the head of the new Ministry
is unspeakably bad in every way- —bad if it
fails, even worse if it succeeds. A few months
ago the object of the party was to obtain certain
democratic concessions from Parkes, and then
after many weeks of weary labour it gave way
to a sudden burst of irrational anger, and
cut down that ancient political plant just
as the crop was about ripe. It was a very
scanty crop and of exceedingly little use,
but still its exact value had been apparent
almost from the beginning, and with this
knowledge at command the party had toiled
manfully to cultivate Parkes, and water him,
and bring him to maturity. After Parkes’
fall the Labour delegates wanted to obtain the
same concessions from Dibbs, and if it suc-
ceeded in abolishing him—as it apparently
hoped to do—at the Murrumbidgee election
that chance would also be wiped out by its own
act—to say nothing of the chance that the
party would be wiped out also. The fact that
such an idea could be entertained showed a
woeful want of calculation and intelligence.
The first object of the democratic section of the
House should now be to get the principle of
One-man-one-vote passed into law at the earliest
possible opportunity, so that, should a dissolu-
tion come at some unexpected moment, it will
get a fair field in the scramble that will ensue.
It has already thrown away whatever chance it
had of obtaining this concession from the old
Parkes Cabinet; if it succeeds by any chance
in stranding the Dibbs Cabinet at the very
beginning of its career the dissolution may
arrive at any time. Then the battle will be
fought over again at the polls on the old pro-
perty basis ; the “ National Association,” with
its elaborate machinery, will raise a more solid
vote in the interests of monopoly than ever was
raised before ; and the Labour members will
appear before their dispirited supporters
as a body of politicians who have done
nothing and elaborately fooled away every
chance that presented itself. A new party
which goes to the country without a single
success to its credit stands a fair show of never
coming back; and it is absolutely essential that
the Labour representatives should effect at least
one amongst their long list of reforms by way of
giving a reason for their existence. The party
has drifted into a strange and anomalous situa-
tion. If, after having backed Parkes, the
bigoted Imperialist, so long and so unquestion-
ingly, it sacks Dibbs, the avowed Republican,
without a trial, it thereby appears before the
country as the tool of the monopolist and
K.C.M.G. section of the nation. If, after
professing to be indifferent alike to Free-
trade and Protection and supporting- Parkes’s
Foreign-trade policy—avowedly out of sheer
indifference, it fails to support in turn his
successor’s Protectionist policy—also out of
indifference, then it will have to go before the
country as the agent of Calico-Jimmyism,
and the enemy of local industry. The only
remedy for this state of things is to start
the party on an entirely new basis. Let every
member of it vote on the fiscal issue according
to his own convictions—it has already been
used too long to prop up the great York-street
importing monopoly, and has gained nothing
by it. Let it bring in its own One-man-one-
vote Bill as a private measure which will stand
on its own merits instead of hanging on to the
tail of M'Millan’s cheap imported slop coats ;
and then if the scheme js placed in a practic-
able form the party w’U at least have the
credit of it, and if it fails, the responsibility
will rest, not on the Labour members,
but on their opponents; and the country
will fully appreciate the fact. Hitherto
the third party has placed itself in such
a position that it had to choose between
supporting a foolish and almost abortive measure
or else voting against its own principles, which
was little better than choosing between two
forms of suicide. Further, let it introduce, on
its own sole responsibility, Bills providing for
the abolition of party government and for the
introduction of the Referendum—two schemes
which are of more importance than even the
One-man-onc-vote policy—and if it fails the
country will send it back some day with a
majority that will command success. And,
lastly, let it avoid gaining a ruinous notoriety
by needlessly standing forth as the enemy of
the first Republican Premier of Australia, and
thus becoming a cheap advertisement for Im-
perialism and grovel. G. R. Dibbs may or may
not be an ideal Republican—time alone can
show ; but any kind of a Republican is better
than none.

The Queen’s Health.
A correspondent writes to The Bulletin in a
jubilant strain, to point out that sundry Labour
members of the New South Wales Assembly
have publicly declined to rise up when the
Queen’s health was drunk at various banquets,
and have thus trodden heavily on the rich and
loyal section of the company, and made them
feel bad. Possibly this paper should feel jubi-
lant over the matter also, but it doesn’t. The
alleged Republican who goes to a banquet
where he knows this ancient ceremony will be
gone through, with a view to objecting to it,
presumably goes for the sake of personal adver-
tisement ; if he only wants to adhere to his
democratic principles he would do it better by
staying away (if he can’t get the promoters to
omit the toast) and leaving out the advertise-
ment. The Protestant who can’t express his
sentiments except by going to a Catholic
church and there publicly cursing the Pope, or
the alleged Christian who feels it incumbent on
him to obtrusively exhibit his New Testament
in a synagogue so that he may know he is a
Christian, is generally hollow. If a demo-
crat finds the weary doggerel of “God Save
the Queen ” thrust on him in theatres and
public places where it has no connection
whatever with the business on hand, he
has every right to protest; when he goes to
haunts where that same doggerel is the prin-
cipal and only real business of the evening, he
has no more right to raise objection than he has
to visit General Booth, and then jerk mud at
him, as a testimony against the Salvation drum.
The man who objects to another man’s fad
when it is thrust upon him is distinctly justi-
fied ; the one who goes in pursuit of the other
man’s fad for the express purpose of firing
bricks at the clay idol is not justified. Even
the Chinaman has a right to his own Joss—in
China. Moreover, the world is trodden hard
with alleged reformers who do nothing for their
cause except level petty insults at the other
side, and it is all time and energy wasted. The
republic is not one whit nearer though 100,000
republicans go to superfluous loyal feeds, and
refuse to drink Queen Victoria’s health.
And if 100,000 republicans refuse to take the
formal and absolutely meaningless “oath of
allegiance ” the result is generally just the
same—it is a big advertisement at the moment,
and the advertiser talks of it for the rest of his
life and does no other good whatever. The
men who will bring along the Australian
Republic will be too busy with the great work
to stop and argue about miserable trivialities
like the Queen’s “health;” they will sooner
drink the utterly insignificant thing than argue
about it. They won’t trouble about oaths and
similar fooleries until the time comes to act;
every man means to be loyal to the sovereign
till the great commonwealth starts, and he may
as well take the oath —till then. The difference
between the two kinds of patriot is just the differ-
ence between Luther and the small, excited
Protestant who lets off squibs on the sth of
November ; between Washington and the boy
who threw mud at King George’s statue. If
Luther had been busy letting off fireworks
he wouldn’t have had time for a Reformation,
and if Washington had devoted himself to
firing mud at the brass eye of royalty he would
have had no leisure to revolushe. And for
these reasons The Bulletin doesn’t care
whether any particular democrat has drunk
the Queen’s health or not. We all drink the
Queen’s health—with one eye on the approach-
ing Republic.

Ways That Are Dark.
The case of Edward Bell, lately lagged in
Melbourne, is a curious instance of the pig-
headedness of the police-force, and the lack of
horse-sense among the administrators of the
law in general. Some time ago one Larck was
awakened by a burglar, and from that incident
Bell’s troubles originated. Larck, according
to his own showing, straightway rushed upon
the midnight prowler, and a fearful conflict
ensued. The visitor was a huge and brawny
ruffian, and they clutched each other with blind
ferocity, and hung on to each other, and ground
the furniture beneath their feet as they dragged
each other frantically about, and wiped the roof
with each other, and otherwise distinguished
themselves. But finally the invader tore him-
self away, leaving one of his coat-tails behind
him, and vanished like the reserve fund of a
land-bank. These facts, and the coat-tail, and
an elaborate account of the size and strength and
awful ferocity of his adversary, were duly
supplied by the prosecutor, and on the strength
of them the police arrested Edward Bell, a
miserable, weedy, stunted little vagrant, a
trifle over five feet high, and partially imbecile
as well. But his pants and waistcoat were of
the same material as the coat-tail herein before-
mentioned, and this fact gave him away.
According to the newspaper reports, the police
simply asked the prosecutor to identify Bell,
and he did it unanimously. The prisoner was
about 12 inches shorter than the perpetrator
of the outrage as described in the original
statement; he had no strength worth speak-
ing of; he was just about as ferocious
as a dishcloth at a maximum estimate ;
he hadn’t got the coat with the missing
tail, and though his pants were of the same
material, that could hardly be called evidence,
for there was no proof that the burglar’s pants
and coat corresponded. Also, the prosecutor
was near-sighted and wore glasses, and the row
took place in the dark when it was almost im-
possible to swear to anybody. Nevertheless,
he swore to the very first man shown him by
the police, and though the man was absolutely
and utterly unlike the person he described, his
statement was cheerfully accepted. The police
swallowed it; the jury took it in; the judge
bolted it whole; and the meek, stunted, little
man of five feet and a few inches is now doing
four years’ hard for being the huge, bulky
ruffian who burst into the heroic Mr. Larck’s
residence and fought like a tiger all over the
premises. Truly the law is a bigger fool even
than it looks.
♦
The Plight of Capital.
The Age rises on its ear once more to complain
that the proceedings of the democratic party of
New South Wales will “drive capital out of
the colony.” We have heard this wail very,
very often till the wail itself has grown old and
haggard with much repetition, but the one
thing that is never explained is how or by what
process capital leaves a “colony.” According to
a recent estimate, the private wealth of New
South Wales is about £410,000,000, and of that
only £9,000,000 is moveable cash. The cash
may quit the country if the capitalist can get
hold of it, though much of it is in the hands of
Hebrews, old maids, preachers, and others
whose capacity for hanging on is simply
unlimited; but, granting that the foreign
money-lender could go round and scoop every-
thing down to the penny in the baby’s money-
box, there would be only £9,000,000 gone and
£401,000,000 would be left. He ean’t tear up
the roads and breakwaters and cathedrals and
things with his claws, and take them along with
him ; he can’t sling the lakes over his back, and
trail the railways and tramways behind him ;
nor can he dig up the mortgaged land, and bag
it, and hump it in a ship to England. These
things are the alien money-lender’s capital; if
he wants to take them out of the country he is
welcome—we want to see him do it. As to the
money, he can’t get half of it—it is too much
scattered ; and if he got the whole of it, it is
only about 2i per cent, of what we owe him,
and when he shifted it there would be a com-
mercial crisis, in which the other per cent,
would be lost. But it couldn’t be done, any-
how—it is a physical impossibility. Only the
other day we came across an alarming article
in a Maoriland paper about the awful manner
in which capital was quitting that country, and
we thought we had found the missing phenome-
non at last—but we hadn’t. It was a gruesome
account of how an imported British speculator
who owned a block of business property at
Auckland, being scared at the property-tax
proposals of the Ballance Cabinet, had sold
out and fled. We imagined for one dreadful
moment that he had taken the buildings along
with him—but it seems he didn’t. The capital
was too heavy to lift, and it is still standing at
the old corner to this day. It was only the
original owner who was gone, after all.
Slab from Bruce Smith’s speech on the Coal-
mines Bill;
Mr. Bruce Smith regretted that from the tone of the
majority of remarks made, it should appear that there
was only one class of men who were concerned in the bill
at all, and he would like to remind the committee that
there were others interested in coalmining besides the
men engaged below ground. There were.shareholders in
the companies working the mines, people who were not
always of the capitalistic class, but were often widows
and orphans, and it was their interests as well as the in-
terests of the miners which should be considered.
The Bulletin hereby informs Mr. Bruce
Smith that this widow and orphan racket
is too aged. We have looked through a good
many lists of shareholders in coal-mining com-
panies, and the widows are very scarce, and the
orphans are mostly old, wily, full-grown
orphans with a desperately keen eye for the
main chance. The genuine bona fide orphan
isn’t in it, probably because his trustee
took the shares, or else because he got
frozen out in some stock-exchange swindle
worked by somebody who got private informa-
tion from those “in the know.” As for the
widow, if her shares are worth anything at all
she got rushed into a second marriage almost
before her late husband was quite dead, and she
isn’t a widow any longer. Moreover, The
Bulletin never noticed Bruce Smith, in his
capacity as a director, taking any special in-
terest in widows and orphans : they arc only
trotted out when some Tory scheme wants to
be propped up. Therefore, it is our firm con-
viction that Bruce Smith himself is the widow
alluded to in the present case, that being the
only kind of widow that he ever seemed to take
much trouble about; and the or plum is also
Bruce Smith, there being no reason to imagine
that he is harassed over the troubles of any
other brand or variety of orphan whatsoever.
So often has the unsupported assertion of a girl
dragged a man to ruin that the ordinary mind
places little reliance on female evidence. The
case of Edwin Hickey, now doing eight years
in Armidale (N.S.W.) gaol, is one in point.
Hickey was a State-school master of apparently
good character. His accuser was a girl pupil,
whom, he alleged, he often had to admonish for
impropriety and forwardness. The trial fur-
nished ample evidence that what the girl didn’t
know in the miry byways of knowledge was
hardly ivorth mentioning. She was a precocious
person with* an ancient optic and an amazing
power of expression. Her story was that she
owed all Her evil knowledge to Hickey. The
defence was that she had trumped up the
charges as a matter of revenge. Hickey’s wife
stood by her husband to the last, a tolerably
certain sign that he was either a decent fellow
or a consummate hypocrite. There was a great
want of corroborative evidence on either
side ; the girl declared that she had been
seduced by Hickey, and Hickey denied the
accusation ; and that was virtually the whole
case. A verdict of guilty was returned, and
the prisoner was sentenced to eight years penrl
servitude. If Hickey had been in the witness-
box and the girl in the dock, the chances are
that she would have got the eight years instead
for perjury, for the bench which gave Hickey
eight years on a dubious-looking girl’s unsup-
ported testimony would as cheerfully have given
her the same sentence on his testimony. The
only visible difference between them was that
she got her case in first, and the average cow-
headed jury always believes the first story,
provided the accused isn’t a person of high
social position, and then it never believes any-
thing. Some day, perhaps, it may dawn on
somebody in power that no person should be
sent to gaol on the mere unsupported assertion
of any other person, but, so far, this idea seems
to have occurred to nobody.
Now that fresh confirmation has been received
from the Privy Council over the McLeod
bigamy case (though none was needed) to the
contention that the New South Wales Supreme
Court had no jurisdiction when bigamy was
committed in a foreign country, The Bulletin
asks Sir Alfred Stephen where was his
authority for hanging Black Peter, the
aboriginal, who inflicted wounds upon his lubra
on the Sydney side of the Murray, though she
did not die till she reached the Victorian side ?
According to strict law the crime was one of
unlawful wounding on this side of the Murray,
or of murder on the other. A murder is not
consummated until the death of the victim, and
the victim did not die within the jurisdiction of
the New South Wales Supreme Court. Yet
Black Peter was tried for murder and hanged.
And, by-and-by, The Bulletin will ask Sir
Alfred one or two other questions of an
analogous nature ; and will also inquire of the
Hon. the N.S.W. Attorney-General when he
proposes, by a short enactment, to repeal the
pertinent sections of Sir Alfred Stephen’s
Criminal Law Amendment Act. Purthermore,
it will seek to obtain a return of all decisions,
since the passing of that Act, which directly or
by implication have been pronounced, by the
Privy Council judgment in McLeod’s matter,
to have been illegal.
The following extracts from recent leaders in
the Sydney Daily Telegraph are interesting
reading :
The only way in which it is possible to form a stronsi or
permanent Government in the present House is by a
coalition on the basis of the fiscal Hiatus qtio. The policy
which the defeated Government went to the country
upon was endorsed by a substantial majority. ... In
the present House he (Mr. Dibbs) can only derive any
such power from shameless political conspiracy and by
occupying a position in regard to the labor party winch
will bring the Government of the country into contempt.
... . If he attempts to introduce a straight-out
protectionist policy, he will do so with the knowledge
that he has to face a House which, on repeatedly avowed
principle, is distinctly hostile.
“The policy which the defeated Government
went to the country upon was endorsed by a
substantial majority.” Yet, in the Daily
Telegraph of 4th July, there is a regretful
acknowledgment that the House consisted of 74
Protectionists, 64 Foreign-traders, and three
doubtful or unspecified politicians, leaving
Parkes and his policy in a minority of at least
seven. Therefore, by the unreliable and
wobblesome print’s own showing, Parkes’
policy was not endorsed at all, but unequivocally
condemned; and it was Parkes who hung on
by “shameless political conspiracy;” and it
was that same hairy philosopher who occupied
a position that was calculated to bring him and
his Government into contempt. It did bring him
there, too, in a most successful manner. In
fact he is there now.
Now t that the vessels of the Australian Tribute
fleet have survived the dangers of their trial
trips and of the vasty deep beyond the limits of
the measured mile, and their captains have got
over the volcanic disturbances in what the
sainted Sairey termed “the innards,” and the
luffs and mids are turning their optics in the
direction of the female offspring of the Tallow-
fats and the Woolbales, and the stokers have
ceased to pray for a speedy removal to Gehenna
in order to escape the infernallcr stokeholes, it
is about time these blawsted kawlinies were
favoured with some “ naval manoeuvres.” We
want something for our money, and we want to
see the torpedo-boats let go and miss every
aim, and the torpedo-catchers make a magnifi-
cent attempt at collaring the torpedo-boats and
getting a firm grip of nothing, and then finding
that Bradley’s Head has delicately insinuated
its rocky edges into the powder-magazine, and
the stewards’ pantry, and the lockers where the
first lieutenant keeps his mother’s Bible and his
best Darling Point girl’s photo, and outpour-
ings. And we want to hear the roar of our 29-
ton guns, and to compare their deep diapason
with the sound of heaven’s artillery, and Dan
O’Connor’s voice when he practises in his back-
yard the opening oration of his forthcoming
series of lectures on “Me and Other Irish
Pathriots,” and to know at what particular
round the average big gun of that calibre ex-
plodes into multitudinous atoms, so that we
may plant Parkes and Booth and the Echo
editor, and the errant William-goat, and other
perennial nuisances, in the neighbourhood of the
next that’s a-goin’ on the bust. We are hungering
to be informed on these points, and also at
what degree the tangent-sight travels to the
deuce, and whether it takes 45 hours or only
45 seconds for the concussion of a monster gun
to shatter the platform and to cause the
armoured plates to dissolve as rapidly as
Parkes’ assets, and whether it is three weeks
or a month before a cruiser roasts every
available stoker till he crackles and is done
brown. And we do not object to being in-
formed, furthermore, of the commanders’
capacity to make Port Jackson when South
Head Light is doused, as it would be in war,
and whether they would not one and all try
and come overland by way of the Gap ; and, in
short, we w r ant to know when Ad. Scott pro-
poses toblaze away a few thousand pounds’worth
of powder and blow up a few guns and a dozen
or two of seamen, to make a Sydney holiday,
and irretrievably to shake the hulls of the fleet
into the fathomless abysses of the rolling wave,
and to generally demonstrate his capacity to
fill at short notice the wards of all local
hospitals with shattered ruins, and every avail-
able dead-house with unassorted fragments of
corpse.

Q«N«n »t, M
Premier Dibbs’ Manifesto.
Premier Dibbs, of New South Wales, has pub-
lished his political programme, and if he lives
up to that document, his Ministry will be about
the only democratic Government which has yet
existed iu Australia. The measures which he
hopes to carry in the fag-end of the present
wasted session are protection to local industry,
the abolition of plural voting, and the establish-
ment of courts of conciliation, and if these three
items of policy are pushed through, the results
achieved w ill be of more use to the country
than all the schemes propounded by Parkes since
the day when there was a Parkes for the first
time iu history. So far, too, the Protectionist sec-
tion has given some proof of its sincerity. It was
that party which first introduced the One-mau-
one-vote Bill before even the Labour-party came
into existence, and it was only by the most
vigorous exertions on the part of Parkes that
the measure was strangled and crowded out.
Then in after days Parkes borrowed this
scheme, and spoiled it in borrowing, and there-
after the House gave him credit for it, and the
Foreign-trade press blandly assumed that the
Protectionist-party was the natural and here-
ditary enemy of the project which it was the
first to advocate iu the House. And now,
strangely enough, this item of the old Protec-
tionist policy is shaken as a weapon at the
head of the party, and it is ordered to accept
its own scheme or stand the consequences.
Beyond this the Government proposes next
session to tackle the vexed question of law
reform, to push through the Local Government
Bill which Parkes has promised in vain for a
quarter of a century, to amend the laws
relating to masters and servants, and the
ancient-tyrannical statutes enacted for the sup-
pression of trades-unionism ; also to bring in a
Goal-mines Bill, and to do something of a
vigorous character for the regulation of the
bogus bank which takes iu the workman’s
savings on fixed deposit, and keeps them for
ever afterwards. Further, it undertakes to dig
up and amend the scheme of Australian
Federation, which Parkes so mysteriously
dropped, and then to submit it to the deci-
sion of the whole community, on a strictly
One-mau-one-vote basis. Consequently the
Dibbs Government is pledged up to the hilt to
democratic reform, and so long as it acts up to
its published programme it deserves the earnest
support of every democrat in New South Wales.
Unluckily, few Governments do live up to their
programme ; but still it is impossible to dis-
charge without a trial a Cabinet which under-
takes a great liberal policy, on the assumption
that it may not live up to its policy, else the
mere fact of a Cabinet promising reform would
be a sufficient reason for abolishing it, and the
only Cabinet which could be allowed to endure
Mould he the one which refused to promise
any reform at all. If the Dibbs Ministry
goes back on its programme in the
days to come then the same grave which
yawned for Parkes is ready for it. At present,
however, the one objection which is raised is
that Protection comes first on the list, and the
other items of reform afterwards, and the
Foreign-trade organs are already whooping up
the Labour-party on this pretext, iu the hope
that that section of the House M ill declare open
Mar, and thus do the dirty work of the great
importing monopoly. As it happens, however,
the country demands Protection quite as
urgently as it does electoral reform, and, more-
over—after a long and disastrous spell of
Foreign-trade—there is a £3,000,000 shortage
close at hand, and if Protection doesn’t come
M-ith exceeding great rapidity New South Wales
goes broke.
In the remote, outlying parts of Australia, the
cheap nigger and the cheap Chinaman are in
their glory. At Palmerston, the Chinaman
owns creation; at Thursday Island the
imported nigger runs the contract, but the
results to the white Australian are the same
either way. On the Island a white man is
getting to be a curiosity. In the principal
stores there are, on a steady average, some ten
low-priced Asiatics to each Australian em-
ployed. The ginger-beer factory is run by
Cingalese. The “cullnd pusson ” humps the
bales and hags on the wharf, and mans
the coal hulks. The drayman employs
a cheap black individual to drive his
cart. The fishing industry is run chiefly by
the same unobtrusive nigger. As for the white
population, it chiefly loafs about looking for a
job, and never finds it. Judging by present
appearances it never will find it. But as at
least one of the capitalists who employ nigger
labour in the seclusion of Thursday Island is a
Queensland M.L.A., and whoops more or less
in the House for the cause of national progress,
The Bulletin hereby invites the local Labour-
party to look him up, and make him reform, or
else cast him out ignomimously on his moral
and political ear.

Item from David Christie Murray :—■
Australia was built up by British enterprise and British
money. It is a British possession still, and without
British protection, British gold, and the trade which
exists between it and Britain, would be in a bad way.
The Bulletin hereby invites Murray to look
at the other side of the problem. Australia was
built up by British enterprise and British
money —by the enterprise and money of those
Britons who settled in Australia, and who,
with their sons, became the Australian
nation, and who now object to the in-
sufferable gall of the other Briton who
lid nothing for the country, but who now
passes himself off as the founder of it. As for
the gold alluded to, Australia has paid for it
all at a high rate, and if Britain isn’t grateful
for the interest, Australia declines to be grate-
ful for the principal. Up to now, Britain isn’t
grateful, so far as we have noticed—in fact, it
is the most ungrateful country we know of.
Also the trade comes under the same heading;
it is a mutual affair, and if Britain isn’t thank-
ful for its end of the trade, then Australia
declines to be thankful for the other end.
Some day we intend to write a pamphlet on
Britain’s awful want of thankfulness for the
profits of the Australian trade and the interest
on the money invested in this country, hut
meanwhile we respectfully draw Mr. I). C.
Murray’s attention to a side of the subject
which he seems to have entirely overlooked.
[?]
846 Macquarie-slrcet North, Sydney, Oct. 28, 1891.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
N.S.W. Horticultural Society blossomed like a rose on
22nd inst.—the festive date on which it held its big
Spring show in the Centennial Hall—rather too gloomy a
place, let me object, to display the flowers to the best
advantage, for under the galleries especially - you had
really to peer to see what it was all about. There were
lots of specimens unrelieved by orchard produce, save and
except a branch of green oranges which gave one a colicky
sensation only to look at them—and the roses were utterly
utter. But what ugly names they give the pretty things 1
A really beautiful, deep-red rose was called the “R. A.
Williams,” and another, equally scenty and dainty, was
dubbed the “Dr. Hogg.” If ever I discover a rose I
intend to call it the “ Thomas Smith.” The decorated
tables—largely placarded “amateur division” in a quite
unnecessary - fashion—left more room for elbows and
plates, and were sometimes pretty - . One of them, with
small flowers, pansies, primroses, and so on, had aetinotus
mixed in, to the indignation of an old lady, who said she
couldn’t “ a-bcar to see wild flowers mixed up with
tame.”
As the Rose Show was the only event of importance in
a dull and dreary week, quite a gang turned up on two-
and-sixpenny- day. Lady Jersey, who set it all a-moving,
backed up by a blonde-haired aide (whom a wicked wag
has christened the “lemonade,” on account of his color-
ing), wore a figured pink silk, not precisely in the fashion,
trimmed with bands of black lace insertion and a narrow
black lace sash ; bonnet in black and gold, black fall,
cream parasol, and presented bouquet of lovely roses of
every colour. Mrs. A. J. Riley was in ccpper silk and
black lace and bonnet of white ostrich tips. Mrs. Calvert
(just from “ home ”) loomed up in black, and Miss Ethel
Calvert rose on the horizon in lavender-spotted white and
a pretty Paris hat. Their fellow-voyageuse, Miss Dick,
was in electric-blue trimmed with guipure lace. Mercury
hat in cream ; Mrs. Burnell, in cream and heliotrope*,
bonnet en suite ; Mrs. Broomfield in pink floral, black
crinoline hat trimmed with pink carnations; Miss M.
Windeyer, in sage-green, checked green straw hat
trimmed with light-green feathers ; the prettiest frock
there was a yellow mousseleine-de-soie embroidered on
the yoke and in a border round the hem with silk sun-
flowers and brown leaves, leaf-trimmed hat with knots of
brown velvet and a wreath of saffron roses. Marie Fraser
was there, chaperoned by one of the family of “ profes-
sional ” hunters, and wore a cream lustre cloak with a
light design of violets and leaves, with yoke of high collar
lined with pink satin, hat covered with white feathers. A
white corduroy gown, lined about with gold, rather sug-
gested breakfast china.
Heat and dust are almost come to stay now, so some-
body ought to let hot and gritty shoppers know that the
Country Milk Co.’s lounge, “The Cascade,” Elizabeth-
street, near King-street, serves very dainty, little after-
noon teas in its cool ladies’ room, with necessary
“toilette” attached, all shrouded from the main shop
with art curtains. Also, the “Cascade” strawberries and
Devonshire clotted cream are just exquisite, and a
“ hygienic ” item, not obtainable elsewhere, is any sort
of stewed fruit and rice—a favourite summer luncheon
order, as the manageress, Miss Saunders, informed
me. The shop is cool, large, and very ship-shape,
with a novelty in the form of a receptacle for parcels,
which can be left till called for—a most convenient thing
for all town travellers, who can send their packages there,
and so dodge the physical wear-and-tear of staggering
round the block weighed down with shopping results.
Mr. Harvey is the presiding genius of this convenient
resort.
A dinner-party to a rather heterogeneous mob, and a
daylight frisk to the members of the ’Varsity Women’s
Society and their hangers-on, comprised Government
House festivities for the last week, after which the Jerseys
had to fly to Moss Vale for a few days to recuperate. At
the Sydney ’Varsity entertainment were Lady Charles
Scott and her sister, Lady Barley, the three graces from
Bishopcourt, Mrs. C. B. Fairfax, &c. Lady Manning
(presidentess of the society) was not en evidence on
account of an attack of influenza. This complaint either
seeks to expend itself on society—at present largely
steeped in gruel and hot flannels and sneezing under the
Louis Quatorze bed-hangings—or else one doesn’t hear so
much about the other people, who have it and are out of
society. By the way, it’s amusing to see how some trades-
folk push their wares on the strength of “ La Gripe,” as a
well-known lady pronounces it. So-and-So’s biscuits are
a sure “ remedy;” a toy-seller says that his toys are the
salvation of convalescent kids; and, lastly, a veterinary
surgeon rises in print to point out that his latest horse-
lotion is a certain preventive, if you rub it in hard
enough. In spite of which you can’t enter into any public
place without being surrounded by most doleful sounding
“ a—a—tish—ows.”
Here is a fresh caught sample of the bright Australian
from Sydney
"VITANTED, young Girl, keep house and as com-
’ ’ panion to young Man. State age, &c., Angus.
Herald Oflice.
No beating about the bush, no sickly “ view matrimony ”
as a screen. “Angus” yearned for a sweeter self to fix
his neckties and read poetry to him in the gloaming, and
he said so,/and there’s the end (or beginning?) of it.
And the moralizing daily, that is so dreadfully shocked at
the number of debatable ladies figured forth in the police
statistics, calmly inserts this promising “ wanted ” and
goes on its anomalous way rejoicing!
What does this snip from the D.T. mean?
/TjENTLEMAN, about 35, stranger, with some
means, would like to correspond with some
good Lady . Object mutual improvement. Address
A. 8., this Office.
Probably' he wants a housekeeper - —not over 20. \et I
would like to sec that “ improving correspondence,”
wouldn't you ? Any odds you like that it would com-
mence with stilted homilies on “ deep” subjects, and end
comfortably with “ My ownest little Duckey ” after all.
Also from the D.T.:
LADY, ill embarrassed circumstances, would like
some Gentleman to LEND her £l3; security.
11., William-st. P.O.
Why this (pecuniarily) embarrassed Being should advertise
for a philanthropist, it she lias security, is one of the
things you can’t understand. Any money-lender will
advance her cash on these teims—and if her “security
isn't firm enough for him, what use would it he to
“ gentleman ?” Unless her reasonable assets are simply
a winning expression and a quantity of dyed hair, and
then, of course .
I hear that it was cynically interesting to see on a dais,
set up for Soul hern vice-regality, a frisky married lady
and her gentleman “friend,” \ieing as to who should
show Lady Blank most attention. The query is—Would
not Lady Blank have dismissed them both with chilly
politeness, if she had known all the particulars of the
story that was hushed up so mysteriously in the wild
day« of a sinful past ?
From Adelaide I have news of the engagement of Miss
Yiolet Brown, eldest daughter of J. A. Brown, Esq., of
Thebarton, S.A., to Mr. 11. C. Graham, squatter, of Black-
rood Park Estate, Strathalbyn, S.A.
“ The Dancing Girl,” at Her Majesty’s (which— the
theatre, not the girl—smells overpowerjngly of paint and
turps—it’s just had its spring coat of kalsomine laid on),
is one of those plays which try to insinuate that man—at
heart—is always a highly moral character yearning to do
good and only wanting a ghostly female in white to occur
at intervals to show him the way-even though he may
seem to be a wicked dook who can’t see the seamy side of
his vices until he has no more money to carry on with.
But I like the D.G. even though it was Miss Villiers—a
mature lady who talked like Harry Hoyte's “ Slender”
and walked like a Marionette—who put her up. Gwen-
dolyn Floyd made a pretty pathetic Sybil Crake and wore
a soft wh’ti clinging frock all through, but though there
wasn’t scope for much toggery in “The Dancing Girl,”
the company seems to let all the opportunity there is go.
Miss A’illiers dressed the 2nd and 3rd acts in rags literally,
even to a pair of soiled Suede gloves which she could
better have left off —and, as for the guests at Guise’s wed-
ding levee Before they'turned up the Duke soliloquised
something about “ My - friends will come dressed in expen-
sive clothing,” &c., and when the draggle-tailed gang
turned up, no self-respecting pawnbroker would have
given a florin for the whole bilin’lot of ’em.
On dit that the feature of a certain Australian city just
now is to see a professional man—a walking miracle of
how to cut a dash 011 nothing a year—tearing round in a
spiff turn-out, a pair of nags, with a cocky-looking Tiger
behind, and a charming girl on the front seat, whom he
is endeavouring to fascinate per means of the trap, the
trotters, and the Tiger. But the cream of it all is that
the entire high-flying panorama is put up by aspeculative
Israelite, who won’t present his little bill until the gilded
prize is hooked 1 What a happy bride she ought to be—
rushed into matrimony on a time-payment turn-out, laid
on by Moses Solomon Cohen !
What I want to enter into is the feelings of the Gaiety
lady in tights when she gets a note calling herself a lovely
creature (with all her paint and gold wiggery on), and
begging her to accord her fond worshipper a daylight
interview. If she does so, painted and wigged as ho
adored her, what a ghastly - spectacle the cream and
carmine will look in the sunlight! And if she takes off
the wig and the paint and comes out in her own mouse-
coloured hair and paint-worn visage, why, she must feel
what a how ling disappointment on two feet she is to her
moon-struck Johnnie, and no woman in the wide world
likes to feel like that. When you seriously come to think
of it, it must be rather awful to have people hurling
bouquets and adoration at you as a radiant blonde with
padded extremities, when behind the horsehair and the
pink dye you know that you are a black-haired, yellow-
faced croppy with limbs like knotted string. The sensa-
tion must be something like lending your soul to some-
body else, I should think.
Talking of things V.R., one Australian Governor is—er
—a little near, and so are his odd-sized suite to the last
man. At a bazaar held in Barataria recently his Excel-
lency - ordered “ sixpence-worth of sugar-plums,” which is
the vice-regal English way of asking for “ ’arf-a-pound of
toothache’’—tendering a shilling in payment, which mass
of capital the horse-leech’s daughter in charge slipped
into tier pocket on the bazaar principle of “no change
given.” But his Ex. waited humbly for that sixpence
until the mob began to whisper loudly “What’s he wait-
ing for?” upon which He (large-capital) mournfully moved
on. Beautiful example of thrift! It is at times like these
one reverently acknow ledges how - well the Queen is some-
times represented!
I am glad to hear that at a recent ball held at Adelaide
Government House, Lady Kintore requested that none of
her guests should wear black gowns—l am only surprised
any of ’em wanted to. The black ball-frock is a blot on
our social life that ought to be put down with a strong
hand, and hit hard when it is down, and why any woman
(I except, of course, elderly - parties) who can afford
sprightlier tints ever gets herself up like Hamlet’s aunt I
am at a loss to understand. Black is supposed to whiten
the skin, but it aiso accentuates every hollow in face or
neck and piles age onto the wearer like Father Time run
mad. Also, if your maid doesn’t sponge the bodice
now - and then, people are constantly reminded that
you’ve worn the dress before- a suspicion that the strong-
smelling black dye further confirms. And, further, to
catalogue its drawbacks the black evening dress being a
great “stay - er” is always the dismal covering of the
woman who hacks after society even though she can’t
afford it—who always plumes herself as she looks in the
glass that after all she is dressed deoollette and in lace
like the rest of the world, hut who seems to have written
all over her that she replaces the Y-shaped bodice for long
sleeves, and promenades in her decent black skirt during
the day-time ! Now I wonder if these are a few of the
reasons why Her Ladyship of South Australia objects to
receive black gowns?
I hear a harrowing tale of two hivin’ ’arts which beat as
one, but which unwisely put in a couple of days at a
relative’s house, with the result that the rosy fetters are
broken and love a blighted quantity. Really and truly,
the best possible plan for a fianeb to follow - if she wants to
be sure that she and Oussie are the right connubial
height, is to put up for a week in the most monotonous
house available, and calmly await symptoms. I knew a
young person who stayed ten days in the same house as
her fianed, and she came back (as I expected) a disengaged
wreck. She said ; “ There he was from sunrise to sunset
ogling me at breakfast, dinner and tea. I daren’t walk an
inch with anybody but him, and when jaunts were arranged
he was monotonously apportioned to me ! Tt was right of
the hostess, of course, but I felt so sheepish that I believe
nated him in 48 hours. It w - as a sort of dress-rehearsal
for the honeymoon, I felt, only one another all the time !
If brides feel as desperately anxious to get away from
proprietorial airs and graces on the part of a man who
has two plates of porridge for breakfast and a pound of
chops, and whom one hears scolding the housemaid about
his shaving-w ator, I don’t want to he one, that’s all
‘•And did ho ever chance to see you with your hair out
of curl?” said I, just to give the other side a show—but
echo had to answer me that question, of course.
But it's queer how monotonously engaged couples
disengage when one of the parties go away— especially on
a long sea trip. Absence makes the ’art grow fonder (on
paper), hut in real life this pretty fiction has to right
about face, judging by results. So fatal is sea-air to vows
of undying constancy that I know one or two men who
have accompanied their inamoratas “home” in prefer-
ence to risking a brief epistolatory snub from the other
side of tiie world, assuring “Dear Mr}' Jones” that her
feelings have undergone a change. Now, why is this
thus? Are the gold buttons on the steamer’s officers
wholly responsible? or is it that, with the average
woman, its “out of hug, out of mind,” if one may so
pervert it ?
A ring of tip top Duehesses lias formed in London to
keep out of proper society some of the weirdilics who get
“asked’ by Wales, an invitation from whom doesn’t by
any means confer the catchet of good form, dontoher-
know ; and, in a tin-pot way, we have the same sort of
thing in Australia. People who are cordially bidden to
the various Government Houses are not invited by a ring
of exclusive families—the sort of folks who grow high
trees round their wall and don't dine with their windows
open onto the street whom you can count on your
fingers comfortably. “Are you going to Government
House?” is socially equivalent to asking “Were 3on at
the Mayor’s ball?” and the reason is obvious ; Governor's
wives must entertain for State reasons, a great deal of
social flotsam, while private hostesses receive according to
their tastes and inclinations—savee?
There promises to be a large Cornstalk growth on the
Fleiningtoii lawn this race-meeting, judging by how
many dozens of people one meets who mean to take a
flight into Egypt with their very best clothes in a brand
new Gladstone-bag. All the new Pullman cars—the
excitement of the route this year—were filled up at an
early date, and would have been crowded over and over
again ; and the frenzy on the part of the Hot Tong to
strike Melbawne in time for the “ Darby ” (31st) supports
the well-known theory that the Cup isn’t in it for stylo
beside the better-dressed first day. Your Sappho has
packed up a few clean collars and a sharp pencil, and
hastens along with the great majority to shed the light of
her speaking countenance on the lawn and birdcage. I
mention this merely to explain why Sydney is going to
feel so desolate by and bye.
Yours affectionately,
SIPPHO SMITH.
A Newcastle correspondent states that
a very successful dental operation was per-
formed upon a leading local resident by Mr.
Charles 1. Harris, surgeon-dentist, of St. Janies’
Chambers, King and Macquarie streets, Sydney,
on Thursday last —the implantation of an a; tificial
tooth into the natural root being cleverly per-
formed. Dr. John Harris and Ur. W. Nixon
were present during the operation, and warmly
congratulated Mr. Harris on his success. Mr.
Harris, it will be remembered, was a partner of
Dr. Slate, of Macqnarie-street, but, on his separa-
tion from that gentleman, took rooms in the above
chambers, and lias furnished them throughout in
a most luxuriant manner, and fitted them
with all the modern improvements and require-
ments essential in the dental art for the higher
grades of his profession.
The latest publican dodge is to get at the
sinful brewer by planing the interior of the beer-
barrels before having them refilled, thus gaining a
gallon or two in eaeli ca c k, equivalent to hundreds
of gallons a year per pub.
Berry is going to get t lie old photo, of
himse'f— taken in his shirt-sleeves as he stood at
the door of his little Prahran grocery shop— done-
up, and have it stuck on the Collingwood dead
walls as a 24-sheet election poster.
Our tile of the San Francisco Argonaut
was mislaid this mail, and when it came to hand
the contents seemed strangely familiar. Then we
remembered that we had read it all in the Sydney
Echo—except only the paragraph about Princess
Louise drinking brandy, and smoking cigars, and
dancing and whooping on the balcony of a hotel,
and things like that. The Echo had borrowed all
the rest, and reprinted it bodily.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea. or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade - ’
SO and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place ; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
Lord Hopetoun seems to be labouring
heavily under an impression that he is the inventor
of ensilage, and a sort of angel messenger to the
agricultural interests of Victoria. Anyway, he
invited a herd of farmers, fat politicians, free
lunchers and other representative persons to
Government House last week, to witness the con-
version into silage of a few oats and other vice-
regal green stuff. It was a ghastly exhibition of
pampered stupidity from first to last, aggravated
by the grovelling conduct of a lot of amateurs who
chucked their services about gratis, and fought
pitched battles in the background for the privi-
lege of forking tares atop of a waggon. But
nothing that transpired at the time was so naus-
eating as the Age report of next morning. The
free and independent radical journal rubbed its
nose in the dust and piped forth these glad
tidings—“A noteworthy incident of the proceed-
ings was that of Lord Hopetoun feeding the chaff-
cutter with his own hands.” Pagh ! Hopetoun
has been feeding The Bulletin chaff-cutter ever
since he made his triumphal entry into Melbourne
behind four dropsical steeds.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Criterion “ Society.”
Theatre Royal “Robbery Under Arms.”
Her Majesty’s “The Dancing Girl."
Garrick “The Librarian.”
“ The Librarian,” George Leitch’s version
of Von Moser’s “Der Bibliotheka,” differs very
considerably in situation and incident from “The
Private Secretary,” though it is run on almost the
same lines. It is, however, more chaotic and
somewhat more improbable than the better-known
version. George Leiteh’s Robert Sparerib does
not suffer so badly from “ idfluedza ” as did
Thornton’s Spalding. His chief weakness is an
inordinate appetite for buns which he stores away
in a hat-box, and a womanish dread of dogs who
hunt him over walls and bite large slices of con-
fectionery out of his pockets. He walks as if on
stilts, and snorts mildly when pursued by the
malacca-cane of his peppery and alleged uncle.
This liver-cursed autocrat, noisy and not very
funny, in the hands of George Chalmers,
has considerably less to do than in Haw-
tree’s version ; nearly all his fat in the
“blot-yourself -out-scene” with the landlady
has been rendered down, till “ Uncle ” is
but a shadow of the athletic bully impersonated
by Harwood. Other characters have, however,
much the same value as in Hawtree’s version.
The spiritualistic aunt, played by Constance
Deorwyn, has a little more to do, and mesmerises
Leitch until he bursts forth into song. H. Diver
plays Gibson, _ the tailor, with a fine cockney
accent, but he is quite out of his element, and far
from inspiriting. The two voung ladies are
lumpishly dealt with by Nellie Lyons and L.
Clitherow ; Charles Holloway is all right as the
Squire, and Frank Cates is at home in his old
part. George Leitch’s version of Rudyard
Kipling’s novel, “The Light that Failed,” is in
active preparation.
** * *
Tom Robertson’s “Society” is possibly
new to Sydney because it contains eight scenes
and twenty-two characters, and gives an amount
of trouble in production that after-results scarcely
compensate for. To stage such a play at the
little Criterion, with its small stage and poor
storage-room, has been an experiment that only
very smart stage-management could have made
successful. “ Society ”is the tale of two wealthy
snobs, father and son, who want to become
fashionably known and imagine everything can be
done with a cheque-book, and a high-minded
nobleman, forced by his unhereditary generosity
to become a journalist. How the poor peer
eclipses the “brassy” boor, marries his girl, and
robs him of a seat in Parliament, need not be
recapitulated; is not the story known to every
reader of the London Journal? Illness having
taken Titheradge and Shine out of the bill after
Saturday night, Cosgrove has been playing Tom
Stylus, the impecunious pressman, fairly well on
short notice, though he might just as weil bo given
to understand that the ordinary pressman is not
likely to walk a drawing-room as if he’d just
stepped out of a stable-yard, and may be informed
that “ proofs ” are by no means narrow and abbre-
viated scraps of paper. Poulton successfully doubles
as Moses Aaron, the bailiff, and O'Sullivan, the
parliamentarian, made up to resemble Dan O’Con-
nor. Replacing Cosgrove, Brian England’s Smiffel
Lamb is about the best thing we’ve had from
him in Sydney. As Chodd, senior, Arthur Law-
rence is all right, and as the Ohoddy junior,
Boucicault scores heavily. Lyndal’s scribbling
scion of a noble house is, if anything, too lovely
and too good. Clitherow as the sleepy lord is not
particularly gratifying, nor does Marie Fraser
call for eulogy as the poor relation expected to
marry money, but Jenny Watt-Tanner’s Lady
Ptarmigant is a finished performance. So far,
“Society” has not knocked the public, and the
Criterion’s auditorium has usually a very gappy
appearance.
** * *
“The Daifcing Girl” is growing steadily
in favour at Sydney Her Majesty’s, but business
everywhere is dull and the treasury is never
apoplectically inclined. Viewed again one is in-
clined to think that this play is a good deal padded
out and that a heap of the allegory, like the bull-
dog, might be cut off without interfering Avith the
story. The manner in which Gooseberry plasters
his hair down on his forehead is aggravating, and
we are filled with an insane desire to heave bricks
at everyone who styles him “Your Grace.” As
that happens every two minutes and as we don’t
own a brickyard, this contract will never be
entered on.

Nellie Farren, who came out for her
benefit in “ Cinder-Ellen ” to be covered with
flowers, has retired again to nurse her ankle. Her
under-study, Missßlenheim, has enough confidence
for a circus advance-agent, dances well, but can’t
sing, and is otherwise a caricature of the star.
I red. Leslie took his benefit in presence of a big
house, on Wednesday evening. Business has been
consistently good throughout the season, though
it dropped slightly in the d.c. when Nellie Farren
was out of the bill. As previously announced on
multifarious occasions Mme. Warskitt’s pupils
dance this (Thursday) evening, and Rolf Boldre-
wood gets a bold advertisement from Alfred
Dampier on Saturday night.
** * *
Up to date we have little news from Bondi,
except that last Sunday’s concert placed Alf.
Wyburd on a pinnacle up to which rival showmen
gaze, aided by telescopes, in goggle-eyed con-
fusion.

Last week Signor Guido Majeroni, actor,
started for a land where a few good men such as
he are doubtless much wanted. For, by its
own showing, the Salvation Band is going there,
and so is the Methodist Conference, and the
vacuous and vociferous street preacher on the keg,
and if they get there, then Majeroni’s pleasant
voice and noble countenance will do good service
by lending a little grace to the congregation. The
deceased Italian was a well - known figure on
Australian stage. He appeared first along
with Madame Ristori many years ago, and from
that time onwards he played a multitude of
characters. “ The Old Corporal ” was a part that
he made his own ; he was a brilliant success as
Rssex in “Queen Elizabeth,” and the other dramas
in which he scored heavily were legion. Financially,
hovVever, he was not much of a success. He never
appealed to the leg-show interest; he was too
refined for the great mass of the gallery crowd;
and the dress circle audiences praised him
rapturously—and stayed away because there was a
scarcity of tights in his dramas. The bald-headed
community passed on Majeroni : he was only a
cultured gentleman and a genius, and it wanted
songs and extremities. Majeroni died slowly of
consumption, and he was fast being forgotten
when his obituary notice in the daily papers
suddenly resurrected his memory. His remains
lie in the cemetery at Waverley (Sydney)—that
sandy waste which looks out on the sea—and as
he died poor, Daniel O’Connor made no speech
over his dust.
** * *
J. C. Williamson’s first appearance at
Melbourne Princess’ last Saturday caused a boom
house—the circle being very full indeed. J.C.’s
Kerry and Rip are just as fresh as on the day
they were made, and the double bill was from
start to finish an unmitigated triumph, in so far
as the star was concerned. The audience was
mostly that kind which goes into frantic mirth
over the presentment of a dull, fat man, who says
“Damn!” and mentions that he would like a
drink. Consequently, when Rip is very dry, the
circle howls with delight, and the stalls are one
great shriek. To us, however, there is nothing
so pathetic as the man who wants a drink. Last
Saturday we were almost moved to tears. What
fine, loveable old boozers are the sacred three —
Rip, Nick Vedder and Jacob Stein always
drunk if they can buy or cadge the where-
withal, and always content to allow their
wives to keep the pot boiling. Von Slaus in the
hands of Edwin Kelly is passable, and Nephew
Hector was fairly played by Charles Brown. Old
Harry Daniels represented Nick Vedder, and
C. Anderson, Jacob Stein. The parts of the
children, Hendrick Vedder and Meenie, were
nicely played by those two most tolerable speci-
mens of that awful infliction, the infant stage
prodigy, May Renno and Violet Ashton. Cautley
was the Hendrick Vedder of the third act, and
being only required to shiver his timbers and
wear his coat half way down his spine, was
extremely satisfactory. Maggie Knight as the
grown-up Meenie of the third act is anything but
pleasing, even though there is small scope for
acting in the part. As for Mrs. Edouin Bryer,
the Gretchen of the piece, she is absolutely
painful. There is no congruity in her representa-
tion of the shrewish vrow, and when she makes
three or four cat-jumps, in an endeavour to throw
herself into the arms of the newly-recognised Rip,
the people groan, and a cold shudder breaks out
all over the house. Her faint is built on entirely
original plans and specifications. She rises
majestically into the air to a height of quite six
inches from the ground, and having shot her-
self two feet forward, she goes astern, and
falls in a moaning heap. Her faint was
timed on Saturday, and it todk quite two
minutes by a fast watch. And under all
these circumstances, one wonders why Maggie
Moore (who was more the draw in “Struck Oil”
rr! all himself) did not enact the Gretchen.
Ihe bill runs until to-morrow (Friday), and on
Saturday “The Old Guard” and the girl in the
purple tights return to worry the bald-heads.
** * *
“ New Men and Old Acres” runs to fair
houses at the Bijou, but is to be withdrawn on
(this) Derby Saturday in favour of “A Night
** * *
The Italians at the Alexandra have signified
their intention of scooting at an early date, and
consequently the houses are improving. Thursday
and Friday, “ Lucrezia,” with Guidotti in the
name part, was put up with no small amount of
success. “ Traviata ” was repeated on Saturday,
and will again be played to-night (Thursday);
Melossi benefited on Tuesday with “Rigoletto,”
and had to hire two drays to carry his share of the
profits.
** * *
The music-halls fill to the doors when the
legitimate at the other houses is being played to
hard, unappreciative chairs. Snazelle opens next
Saturday at the Athenaeum with his nreviously-
mentioned version of “Enoch Arden.” Miss
Snazelle (says the advt.) will strike the piano keys
very hard several times, and Langdale, a gentle-
man who breathes gently into 12 feet of bamboo,
misnamed a bassoon, will likewise (lend the light
of his countenance to the show.
** * *
Geo. Rignold, at the Royal, continues to
fall into the tank with cheerful equanimity, and
the gallery begins to regard him as an obese seal
who may be expected to sit up and bark presently.
There is no mention of a change just yet, and it
is likely that the “Lights” will play over the Cup.
** * #
“The Yeomen of the Guard,” which was
staged for three nights at the Adelaide Royal, has
concluded the most prosperous comic opera season
ever held in that city, and the dollars of the devout
are consequently in the pocket of J. C. William-
son. Before leaving the city of godliness Elsie
Cameron recovered from influenza and was able to
warble successfully. Bracy also got back his voice.
Billy Elton suffered from hoarseness, but struggled
gamely on. Ryley, Vernon, Rosevear, Violet
Varley, Flora Graupner, and others have been in
rare voice. “The Jonquille,” by Guy Boothby,
a local author, will be revived for three nights for
his benefit prior to his departure for England,
where he goes in search of fame as a play-writer.
Maud Williamson plays the principal part in
Adelaide. Fitzgerald’s Circus has been attracting
enormous crowds within their spacious tent, and
Brofessor Anderson has likewise been doing well
at Garner’s Rooms.

Miss Myra Kemble and Co. knocked out
“Jane” in three rounds at the Brisbane Royal
last week. Inside and outside the prospect has
been cheerless. The descendant of the Kembles
filled the title part, and the others hung about
anyhow, like the ghost of a vanished beer, or the
memory of the cigar that was smoked in the long
ago. The piece floundered heavily from act to
act and seemed to Vish it was dead, and among
the minor members of the company there was
visible a weary longing to throw the whole con-
tract up. Whatever fun cropped out was mostly
due to the authors of the play, although Miss
Kemble and Mr. Lester did their best to give the
S reduction a show. In the same bill, “ The Cape
fail,” a one-act play by Clement Scott, was
perpetrated.
At Poverty Point.
A Melbourne paper says: ‘‘Madame Melba has had a
singular adventure at Paris. She had been engaged to
take part in the musical portion of a fashionable wedding,
but the Archbishop objected to ladies singing in churches.
Tnen the lady in charge of the proceedings induced
Madame Melba to hide behind the organ, and put a
lad, missal in hand, to stand up in the choir and pretend
to sing, while the prima donna poured forth her wealth of
voice. The Bulletin here draws a fancy picture of a
piuua donna hidden in a doubled-up condition in some
dusty recess among the rats, and lying low till her time
ca , , . ne .. t 9 Wouldn t it have been a good deal brighter
a he if it had been pointed put that the boy was Melba in
disguise, and that she had arrived carrying her clothes in
a bundle, and dressed herself secretly under a seat ?
Atjatest dates Bland Holt was playing “Master and
™ Jp good business at Christchurch, Maoriland.
Walter Howe and “Beelzebub ” are the popular favourites,
and Jack Walton is frantically besought by an excited
and chivalrous pit to “ stouch ” Humphrey Logan while
he has him down.
One drawback to belonging to the stage must be having
your tea so early-about five p.m. It looks really
sheepish when you pass the suburban dwelling-place of
that sparkling comedy company to see the heroes and
heroines of theevening’shighfalutin’sittinground the table
sipping tea, with the sun in the heavens and a few brats
looking through the palings. It doesn’t chime in at all
with one’s pre-conoeived. notions of the whirling, riotous,
Bohemian existence the glittering actor-man is supposed
to lead, when you see him carving the mutton at 4.30,
while the juvenile lead with the wicked eyes takes a
second cup of tea—it looks from the outside as if the
whole gang had been sent back to the nursery. Of course
histrions must let their victuals shake down before the
curtain rises or else their utterances would sound fat
and over-fed, and the jeune premier would probably
hiccough during his declaration of love—but there is no
occasion to make your modest meals with doors and
windows wide open to the public gaze. And when people
look in upon this inntcent spectacle in the afternoon and
then go and see the play at night, they can’t forget the
happy family aspect the company presented strung round
the early teapot, and the glamour of the show grows plain
and ordinary, and coldly material in consequence.
It is related that a London comic actor dismissed hi 8
valet for going to see him act. Also, that Mrs Seymour,
who kept house for Charles Reade, threatened to dismiss
a servant girl for reading one of Mr. Reade’s novels, the
printed book.
General and Mrs. Mite, the pair who look like our
esteemed grandparents viewed through the wrong end of
a telescope, are doing the West Coast of Maoriland, but
will be back in time for the Melbourne Cup. Why they
will be back for the Cup isn’t stated, unless the Mites are
going to plunge on Correze.
In one of Rider Haggard’s stories a shipw'recked mil-
lionaire, dying on an island where paper and ink are non-
existent, has his will executed on a girl’s back with a fish-
bone. It nearly kills the girl, but the will holds water.
A play based on this tale is to be produced shortly in New
York, and now the trouble is that there is an awful
amount of writing to go on the heroine’s shoulders, and
the lady who takes the part is so small that there isn’t
room for it.
British theatre-goers never take to plays on Joan of
Arc because J. Bull’s instinct scouts the idea of Divine
agencies interfering to promote the defeat and humilia-
tion of England.
An illness prevented the Mikado of Japan from patron-
ising Airs. Potter at Yokohama ; however, he gave her a
Japanese dog.
The Nizam of Hyderabad gave Mrs. Potter a nest
woven of pure gold, containing three black pearls for
eggs over which hovered a bird constructed of diamonds.
A toadying London rag contradicts the rumour that
Patti will entertain Battenberg’s Beaty at Craig-y-Nos,
saying that “ the same reason which prevents the queen
of song from appearing at State concerts would naturally
militate a Princess of the Blood Royal honourim' our
greatest songstress.” Patti’s affair with Nicolini saves
her a lot of bother. Royalty, of course, can’t forget her
desertion of that wretched pimp and loafer, de Caux.
Fifteen years ago, under the name of Harley, Frank
Cates made his English amateur debut in Hamlet, sup-
ported by many who have become famous, including
Beerbohm Tree as Polonius and Gravedigger, and Herbert
Flemming as Laertes.
Stanley, the old-established family brigand, late of
Central Africa, will open at the Alelbourne Opera House.
The other day the Argus cableman announced the
appearance in Manchester of Mr. R. F. Cunningham in
the “ Bohemian Girl.” This is a brother of “ Brains ” of
the Argus. Hence the Victorian public’s thirst for news
of the gentleman.
Great excitement in Chicago over a drama, produced,
on the life of Abraham Lincoln, culminating with Wilkes
Booth shooting him in the stage-box.
Theatrical business at Hobart is dreadfully handicapped
by the only theatre being situated right away in the
suburbs. Alanagers who know the value of casual “ biz.”
will understand what a serious thing this must be. In
consequence of the recent bank smash land could be pur-
chased at reasonable rates almost anywhere in Hobart.
The old Bank of V.D.L. itself could be converted into an
opera house for a song.
Charles Jamrach, the lately-deceased London naturalist
and showman, was thrice married, and the last of his
wives survives him. On the death of the second a friend
came to condole with him. “ Yes,” said Jamrach, “ she
was a good wife, but she never took kindly to the animals,
and even in the winter she would never let the snakes
sleep under the bed.”
A doctor says: “When the stage hero tries to lay his
hand on his heart he almost always hits himself a foot
away from the right place. Yet if he struck the correct
spot the audience would probably howl at him in derision.”
Farjeon and Lestocq have dramatised “Grif”—it will
be produced soon at London Surrey. Didn't Dampier
play a version of Farjeon’s novel by Garnet Walch ?
Hamilton Magee, B. and B.’s Sydney manager, is now
wrestling with the influenza. He’s got ‘’em bad, but hopes
to be in front again shortly.
An exquisitely-figured Jewess, enveloped in a skin-
tight, flesh-coloured, woyen-sflk garment from neck lo
toe-tip, and veiled with diaphanous drapery, is dancing at
Pans, allegedly after the fashion of Herodias when she
won the head of John the Baptist.
In addition to the Cragge family of acrobats, George
Alusgrove has engaged for “ Forty Thieves,” at Sydney
Royal, Rose Bearing, as “ leading girl,” Amanda Noel as
premiere danseuse, Fred. Mason as leading comedian, the
Almonte pantomimists, the “ Fairy Four” quartette, and
probably Alarietta Nash, an American girl, as “ first boy ”
John Gourlay and Fred Shine are also on the list, and
Jenny Lee may join. Cellier and Plumpton are selecting
the songs, and all the dresses are being made in London
and Paris. Heaps of encouragement to native talent.
Paris Figaro speaks glowingly of Airs. Potter’s good
looks. Airs. P. tells the French critics that she acts in
their language. That’s more than she can do in English.
Alinnie Palmer has been playing “ Aly Sweetheart ” at
the London Vaudeville. Permanent reconciliation seems
to have taken place between her and “ yours merrily,”
who has laid aside the carving-knife of matrimonial
warfare to nobble the critics once more.
When Henry Arthur Jones arrived in New York the
English actors resident there petitioned the mayor to
hoist the Union Jack on the City Hall, and fire a salute
in Central Park, but the mayor knew not Jones and he
didn’t.
Johnny L. Hall, son of the late lamented comedian,
gave up the professional stage some time back, but
occasionally buys a cheap stick of grease-paint for use
at amateur theatricals. His latest show was on Oct. 14,
at North Alelbourne, when he held up his own end of the
log and most of the middle as the low comedy man in
“ Daddy Hardacre,” and the bailiff in “In Possession.”
The young J.L. plainly shows his descent from the
inimitable Captain Gingah, although he has not got the
experience of stage and humans which the elder
possessed.
A lady was described as an actress in a A'elhourne
suburban court the other day, and the opposition lawyer
said; “Actress! She takes on the bone, and leads off
the dog.”
Air. Walter Bentley, who recently arrived from the old
country per Oroya, opens at the Theatre Roval Alel-
bourne, on the 14th prox. in “Rob Roy.”
The Achurch-Oharrington crowd has been playing at
Hobart to fair audiences. During one of the Ibsen plavs
a member of the company got “stuck ” for a moment :
“Oh, you brute of a man ! •” hissed Janet loud enough for
ost of the audience to hear.
Mrs. Palmer (Rosa Carandini) says that Signora Cut-
tica is the finest operatic soprano she has ever heard.
Majeroni s last Melbourne appearance was in a little
one-act comedy at the Royal, for somebody’s benefit. A
serious defect in the poor Signor’s management at the
r> U j . length of the waits, which were frequently
of Bernhard tian proportions* and became after a time the
means of keeping matter-o>f-fact people out of the theatre..
Chas. Hugo, of the Buffalo Minstrels, seems to have got
himself disliked in Maoriland for his rash behaviour in
bringing a charge of embezzlement against his manager,
young Harry Gribben. The alleged crime was only a
matter of twelve “bob” in all, and as the charge broke
down ignominiously at that, it certainly looks as though
Hugo must have been darned hard*up for a grievance
before making such an unamiahle exhibition of himself in
court. Gribben, by the way, has the reputation of being
a decent young fellow entireh r ..
Parkes is itot going to resign his seat in
Parliament just yet.
A Chinaman at Tarrawingee, Vic., was
snake-bitten on one of hia thumbs the other day.
Ihe poor snake died. The other reptile recovered.
Apropos of the Chicago Exhibition appoint-
ments by the moribund Parkes Government, it
has leaked out that Sir Henry Parkes actually
promised each billet to at least two persons.
Premier Griffith judiciously feeling his way
through the agency of a colleague, states by
Proxy :—“The public voice says distinctly it is
not wise to introduce into Queensland alien or
coloured labour.”
Dibbs’ Ministers, except Frank Suttor, of
Bathurst, may all be regarded as Sydney men,
although (leaving out Barton and the two in the
Upper House) they _ represent country ' consti-
tuencies. They live in the metropolitan district,
and have their interests in the city.
“The Times expresses doubt as to Mr.
Dibbs’ prospects of retaining office. ” This mes-
sage was mutilated in transmission; it should
have conveyed the idea that the English manufac-
turers and exporters are in a blue funk at the
prospects of the N.S.W. tariff being radically
amended.
Oscar Meyer is connected in a roundabout
way with Croesus Burdekin, hence he is an
Admirable Crichton in the eyes of Parkes. The
Burdekin influence has always commanded the
respectful attention of Sir Henry, from the days
when he used to handle pig-iron in old Burdekin’s
store.
Young Australia is the ruling element in
the Dibbs Administration. Dibbs, Barton,
Suttor, O’Connor, and Slattery are cornstalks;
Lyne is a Vandemonian; See of English birth ;
Kidd is a Scot; Salomons is an old Sydneyite ;
and Copeland is Yorkshireman enough to supply
backbone ad. lib. to the Government.
According to Molesworth Greene, a Border
squatter who owns stations in Q., N.S.W., and
S.A., the rabbits are like an innumerable be-
leaguering army trying to penetrate from N.S.W.
into Q. “They have made a broad, hard road
along the N.S.W. side of the (rabbit-proof) fence,
and on this they tramp up and down, trying to
get through. The country on the Queensland side
(of the fence) is luxuriant with vegetation after
this fine season, while on the New South Wales
side of the line it is a desert of red sand, relieved
only by rabbits and black stumps of dead bushes.”
Last week a vague report got somehow
into circulation in London that Queen Victoria
was dead. It was promptly contradicted, and
therefore it seems probable at the time of writing
that she is still alive. But if she had been dead
the statement would have been contradicted all
the same. For some inscrutable reason when a
royalty is taken seriously bad the one prevailing
idea is to keep the fact dark ; when a royalty
is dead the great objeet is to keep that dark
also. Albert the Good had become a remains
some time before the doctors gave up publishing
statements about his rapid recovery, and he
wasn’t an aggravated case of the kind by any
means. More than once in history a dead mon-
arch has run an empire for three weeks, and no
one ever noticed much difference, sometimes the
deceased potentate seemed to manage things a
little better than the live one, but that was all.
Joe Jinks alias Joseph Jackson the other
day escaped from two policemen while being con-
veyed to the Penrith (N.S.W.) lock-up, was
speedily recaptured, immediately taken back to
the courthouse, and given an additional three
months. For what offence ? He did not “ break
gaol; ”he simply scooted for liberty in the street
and ran an impromptu footrace with the police.
If two constables couldn’t keep him in safe
custody they should get three months and not (as
an Australian Judge once ruled) the prisoner, who
merely followed a natural inclination for freedom
as soon as an opportunity presented itself. It
would be interesting to know under what statute
the Penrith Bench gave Jinks the extra three
months? Or was it merely for “contempt” in
not obeying the previous judgment of their
Worships? The writer knew a man who escaped
from the Port Curtis lock-up, in Queensland,
years ago, by rushing out when the keeper
opened his cell-door. He, too, was speedily re-
captured—fell down a saw-pit, if memory serves
aright, with the hue-and-cry man scrunch atop
of him—and it was ruled that the police could
formulate no valid charge against him, since he
only ran out of an open door and did not legally
“ break out of gaol.”
Since embezzlement became the most
fashionable crime, the influenza has become the
most popular affliction, and eucalyptic remedies
are the most reliable specifics within easy reach of
the common sneezer who can’t afford to worry a
guinea-a-time doctor, but who must get well' on
the cheap, if at all. Among the various eucalyptic
oils, “ essences,” “ spirits,” &c., Nance’s Mia-Mia
Eucalypti Extract stands highly recommended, as
being pure, strong, and certainly curative. The
efficacy of the aromatic, volatile principle of the
Australian “ blue-gum ” (eucalyptus globulus) for
all ailments of the respiratory system has now
been established for more than a-qnarter of a
century. Nance’s Mia-Mia Extract is manufac-
tured in Sandhurst, Vic., the Sydney depot being
at 480 Oxford-street, Paddington.*

(Near Bathurst Street.)
POLITICAL
POINTS
Property has its duties, but they ought to
te made a good deal heavier.
There are seven Australians in the Dibb s
Ministry. The day of the cheap imported politi"
cian is about over.
You may sack, you may pension off Parkes a 8
you will,
But the hair of the old ’un will rise at you still.
Premier Ballance (Maoriland) : “ It is the
absolute duty of a Government to see that em
ployment is provided for every man willing anc
able to work.”
Fourteen years ago, when Parkes was de-
feated for a Sydney constituency, the old man
said : —“The door of my political life is closed for
ever.” He is now repeating the same old gag.
Hon. W. H. Reynolds, speaking on Sir
Geo. Grey’s Law Practitioners Bill, in the Maori-
land Upper House : “ If I had my way I would
hang one half the existing lawyers and quarter
the other half.”
It is going to be enacted in N.S. Wales
that for the future a camel is to be an animal.
This was rendered necessary through a Bourke
bench of magistrates deciding some time ago that
it wasn’t one.
G. D. Carter, M.P., Vic., says: “ If Mr.
Munro complains of himself for voting 25 times
at an election, why not bring in a Bill to dis-
qualify himself, instead of us, who only want to
vote twice ?”
That “sardine-tin,” the gunboat Tweed,
has been sunk at Hongkong. She was one of a
dozen failures, unable to steam, steer, sail, or
fight, built in 77. The balance are rusting out in
the dockyards.
Out of the ten members of tire incoming
N.S.W. Ministry four are lawyers. If G. R.
Dibbs means to be a success he will chuck three
of them out, and keep his eye on the other one.
Four lawyers is a ruinous percentage.
Morehead, M.L.A. (Q-), would like to
disfranchise the Civil Service. It helped to fling
him out of the Val'ey representation not long ago,
and Morehead has a long memory, and a fathom-
less smile, and a dark and vengeful soul.
Some iconoclast proposed in the Victorian
Upper House that in future a Judge should be
merely an ordinary bald-headed citizen, and that
his horse-hair top-knot should be abolished. The
ancient decoration was saved by only one vote.
Nearly a thousand unemployed registered
at the Queensland Government Labour Bureau in
six days. Yet the blind and crippled Coalition
spends £32,000 a year of the people’s cash to bring
in more immigrants and accelerate the public ruin.
“It is no new plan, this of ‘General’
Booth’s. Moses led forth the people of Israel
under God’s own guidance, in the days of old, to
try a new country ; but it was not a success. I
don’t say tiiat God couldn’t do it, but He didn’t.”
—Parson h Hirer.
The Northern Territory of S.A. is the only
part of Australia the local press of which has
invited Booth to send along his “Submerged
Tenth.” And there the invitation is evidently
based on the theory that the submerged tenth may
come in useful to eat the Chinamen.
The Parkes Government in its last
moments filled up with its friends, supporters,
and hangers-on, all the profitable billets it could
lay its hands on, and all it leaves to its successors
is the job of deciding what shall be done with two
individuals who are waiting to be hanged.
The London correspondent of a Melbourne
journal states that: “ From Malta Mr. Henniker-
Heaton wrote a letter tothe Times, paying a high
compliment to the late Mr. Raikes, and modestly
declining to become a candidate for the position of
Postmaster-General of Great Britain ! ”
According to latest advices, when Parkes
was beginning to slide into the abyss he tried to
square the Labour-party with the offer of two
billets on the Public Works Committee. The
bribe wasn’t big enough. If he had offered his
scalp it might have been a more solid inducement.
Parkes held office in N.S.W. nearly twice
as long as “ Slippery Charlie ” Cowper. Parkes
was in office 14 years, 5 months, (i days ; Cowper,
7 years, 8 months, 22 days ; and Martin, 5 years,
5 months, 25 days. Parkes drew £28,800 13s. 4d.
from the Treasury in official screw. Where is dot
monish now?
Mr. W. P. Crick is said to contemplate
retirihg from West Macquarie to oppose Mr.
Barton at East Sydney. Should he do so, he has
a fair chance of being left. The man who beats
Barton has a big contract. That politician’s
affable smile alone would carry him through, and
Crick can’t smile worth a hang.
A conservative newspaper is not a pro-
fitable spec, in Maoriland. One daily, run in this
interest, has shown a debit balance for the past 10
years averaging about £5OOO per annum. A big
firm of solicitors subsidise the company to the
extent of £lOOO a year, which is deducted pro rata
from the rents collected by them for about a dozen
absentee landlords.
“Oxley” Grimes, M.L.A., Queensland:
“I believe it would be to the advantage of hon.
members and of the good government of the
colony, if the bar in the parliamentary refresh-
ment room were closed while the House is sitting.
If hon, members do not come into the House
absolutely drunk, they are often talkatively
drunk. It is often the whisky, and not the man,
that speaks.”
A British voter got disqualified recently
as follows :—For six years he had been lodging in
a back room and had voted as an elector for
Chelsea. Some weeks ago he removed into the
front room and was knocked off the roll, because
it transpired that though the back room was in
Chelsea the front one—which opened off it —was
in Westminster. The question now arises—what
would happen if he lived in the doorway ?
The new Government of N.S.W, is built
up as follows : —Premier and Colonial Secretary,
Mr. Dibbs; Treasurer, Mr. See; Attorney-
General, Mr. Barton; Lands, Mr. Copeland ;
Works, Mr. Lyne; Public Instruction, Mr. F. B.
Suttor; Justice, Mr. R. E. O’Connor, M.L.C. ;
Mines and Agriculture, Mr. Slattery; Post-
master-General, Mr. Kidd ; Vice-President of the
Executive Council, Sir Julian Salomons, M.L.C.
“ AND BITTERS.”
HE (English, to his French wife); “Are you ready, cheie?"
SHE: “That is the very first time you have ever called me cherie since our marriage.”
HE : “ Ah, ray dear, you will never let me finish a sentence. I was about to say sherry—
and bitters.”
Sandford, newly elected labor-member for
Christchurch. Maoriland, is a comp, in the
Lyttelton Times Office. When the result of the
polling was announced, giving him a nearly 2 to 1
majority over the conservative candidate, Sand-
ford straightway bolted for the office and went
back to his frame. The enthusiastic crowd that
wanted to whoop with him and liquor him up
never thought of looking for him there, so it was a
lost celebration.
The people of Switzerland have decided by
a crushing majority for Protection, for a State
bank, and for making the issue of bank-notes
Government business only. This is solid demo-
cracy, and it has been accomplished without any
long-haired politician stumping the country and
getting up a “campaign;” without any crisis;
and with no speeches worth mentioning. The
Referendum works silently and without any fuss,
and it records the absolute will of the people as
nothing else can.
The reprobate who knocked a sky-pole
through the roof of the Victorian Constitution by
prigging the Speaker’s mace is still untracked.
Meanwhile, Parliament crowds through with an
old second-hand bauble, which had been stowed
away for years in a lumber-room. Sir Matt.
Davies has now, wo understand, ordered a new
mace, to be cut according to the latest fashion
decollete and pouffe, and he is going to sleep on top
of it for the future, and hold it in his hand when
he is under the shower-bath.
Is the Mr. Curnow, appointed to a
clerical position by the N.S.W. Chicago Com-
mission, a relation of Editor Curnow of the
S.M. Herald, and of ex-Minister Brunker? A
nephew of Mr. Brunker named Curnow was
appointed as a shorthand writer once to a royal
commission ; but it turned out that he did not
write shorthand —at all events not rapidly enough
to fill the billet. Editor Curnow is a brother-in-
law of ex-Minister Brunker. Which explains
many things.
Johnston, M.L.A., declares that the
Labour-party will require democratic concessions
from Premier Dibbs, and will not support Dibbs’
Protectionist policy in return. Therefore, suppos-
ing—as seems to be assumed —that Dibbs isn’t a
democrat by instinct any more than Parkes, and
is only giving concessions in return for support,
and considering that Johnston practically informs
him in advance that he won’t get the support
even after he has given the concessions—isn’t
there a fair chance that Dibbs may rise up and
state that the bargain is too one-sided altogether ?
Another Indian native journalist has got
into trouble. Like the editor of the Bangajsasi,
he had been easting reflections on his gracious
Sovereign, and was arrested. But as the charge
of sedition against the previous editor fell
through, and as this case was even weaker than
the other one, the second pressman wasn’t brought
to trial. He was simply kicked a little by the
police during his arrest, and judiciously knocked
against the wall, and as he died an hour after-
wards much beastly trouble was thereby saved.
Salomons, the Dibbs Government’s repre-
sentative in the Upper House, states —according
to the Sydney D.T.—that he wants “ to conserve
the freedom and liberty of the individual and
uphold the rights of property, in so far as they
were provided for and in accordance with that
political and social constitution which was one of
the greatest inheritances from the mother country,
and which had been slowly built up during hun-
dreds of years, by some of the greatest minds of
the various generations.” If Salomons is going to
fire off great slabs like this at short intervals he
will be a ghastly incubus on the new Cabinet.
J. Macfarlane, M.L.A. (Q.), in replying to
the debate on his motion to prohibit drinking at
the Parliamentary bar during session, graphically
described a scene that occurred ten years ago in the
Bananaland Assembly, when a dead-drunk mem-
ber was painted as a clown. Macfarlane’s yarn
recalls, an occasion on which the razzle-dazsdi
extended to the Press gallery and attacked the
sacred person of a city editor, who boasted the
possession of a magnificent carroty beard. Some
legislative joker, finding the Archimedean lever-
man asleep, deftly cut off one-half of his only
ornament.
Boyd Dunlop Morehead the other night
wasted 40 minutes of the Queensland Parliament’s
time in baiting Speaker Norton for having ordered
the closure of “ the main door in the new wing”
of Parliament House. B.D.M. ac-
cused Norton of assuming “a Balmaceda-like
dictatorship,” the grievance appearing to be that
hon. members couldn’t get at the hat-rack—they
don’t wear “ Andykellies ” that can be doubled up
and poked in a pocket up there—without “ walk-
ing half-way round the building.” This reminds
us of the time when Bent complained that the
fence round the Victorian Parliament House was
so high that he couldn’t get back after dinner.
It is a serious sign that the times are out
of joint when a London financial paper begins to
talk like this :
We very much doubt if Russia will get through the
coming winter without seeing the assassination of the
Czar and a Republic declared. And if so, Germany, ruled
to-day by a young prig, will follow suit. And let these
two countries decide for the new regime, and bang goes
the lot. Although we all seem to believe that England is
monarchical, do not let us hug the idea too closely to
our bosoms. The Queen has scandalised the nation with
the berths and salaries given to these German Tecks, or
Christians, or Battenbergs, and any fine day we may see
the whole system of government changed. Well, what
will it matter to the crowd? Victoria has “absorbed”
(good word, that) as much cash as she can ever spend,
and if the Prince of Wales has chosen to discount an
inheritance he may never get, it is his own look-out.
Inspired writers in the Queensland press
are endeavouring to reconcile the white workers to
the wholesale Italian immigration scheme tendered
by the Griffith Government as a sop to the sugar-
planters. These champions of mean whites assert
that the coming Italian is a desirable importation,
and that each of them will be required to produce,
in evidence of his hona-hdes and sterling value :
1, A certificate of good conduct (from whom?);
2, a certificate declaring him to be a hona fide
agricultural labourer (probably from a gaoler, or
gamekeeper, or wharf-loafer); 3, a police certifi-
cate of ignorance as to his character, or a certifi-
cate supposed to be from a policeman, more or
less; 4, a medical certificate (same old guinea
deception proving that twenty-four of him ran
past a doctor in ten seconds without showing
any disease); 5, a passport. All of which is very
comforting indeed.
Why didn’t Dibbs appoint Crick as
Government representative in the Upper House?
Dibbs has strong democratic tendencies, and—
unless his principles go the way MTlwraith’s did—
he must tackle the question of reforming the
Council some day or other. Unluckily, the Coun-
cil can’t be abolished off-hand in a legal way,
because it must pass the Bill for its own abolition,
and it won’t do that; and it is difficult to flood it
with a democratic majority, for the average demo-
crat goes to seed almost as soon as he gets into
that Chamber, and becomes petrified. Therefore,
the shortest wav would be to send Crick there and
let him talk the Council to death. Besides, a
Government is no good unless it has some humour
in it, and the spectacle of the excited little man
plunging round in that solemn assemblage, with
his hair standing up and his coat-tails flying in six
different directions, and his collar and tie bursting
from sheer frenzy, while the old fat men sat
around in horror, would be a gladsome thing and
calculated to elevate the soul.
The London Court Journal says :— “Mr.
Gladstone dines out with a regularity and daring
that could not be excelled by a man of half his
years. One who meets him often at these gas-
tronomic tournaments say that Mr. G.’s participa-
tion in their enjoyments is by no means per-
functory. Some men past (50, still dining out,
enjoy themselves under severe restrictions, daintily
picking their way through the menu. Mr. G.,
past 80, is apparently under no such restrictions.
He eats what comes, generally right thi’ough'the
menu, and can take his glass of port after his
libation of champagne, a test from which many an
ardent diner-out would shrink. His mental
activity is on a par with his physical vigor. His
conversation is a never flagging flood, brimful of
interest. If it were only possible to reproduce a
verbatim report of his conversation at a dinner-
party, where the personal surroundings are suf-
ficiently interesting to excite him to talk, there
would be produced a volume of interest, biographi-
cal, autobiographical, and historical. His memory
is marvellous, and his power of graphically recall-
ing an incident is the admiration of even the
gentlemen behind the chairs.” Mr. Gladstone is
to be congratulated on possessing a perfect liver,
not all men can say the same; the slightest over
indulgence in eating or drinking is sufficient with
some people to upset the liver and cause bilious
attacks ; these eventually lead to serious disease
and make the sufferer’s life one continual misery.
Timely use of Clements Tonic with an occasional
dose of Dr. Fletcher's pills will always cure the
most serious cases, as shown by the proofs vouch-
safed by Mr. W. Kelly, Albury, N.S.W., who
says: “For nearly twelve months I have been
subjected to such a most distressing disease, that
I thought my constitution was breaking up. I
had most acute pains in my chest, and my liver
was so enlarged that I could not lie on my right
side, there were also sharp pains around the
kidneys combined with severe headaches simply
unbearable, causing great physical weakness. I
was treated by doctors but only experienced
temporary relief from my complicated disorders.
When my condition was most critical I was per-
suaded to try Clements Tonic, which I took with
Dr. Fletcher’s pills, and after the use of the first
boctle of Clements Tonic my pains vanished like
magic. I used in all three bottles of Clements
Tonic and two boxes of Fletcher’s Fills, and the
swelling of my liver was removed. I have gained
greatly in weight and my chest and lungs are
stronger than over. lam well known as an old
resident and my recovery has excited much
interest here.”

the fire.
By the death of Mr, William Byrnes,
G. H. Cox becomes “father” of the N.S.W.
Legislative Council, having been appointed in
June 1863.
John Williams, for 32 years Crown-solicitor
of N.S. Wales, was buried at Rookwood on the
21st. Mr. Williams’ predecessor—Mr. W. W.
Billyard—is still living.
Harry Stockdale, of buffalo - syndicate
notoriety, is now busily engaged in chasing out-
side buffalo-hunters off his big lease of country
around Alligator River, N.T.
By the “ smash ” of an old-established
flour-mill down South, Hugh Murdoch, one of the
heaviest losers in the V.D.L. Bank, will be let in
to the tune of £13,000. It never rains but it
pours.
The “ father ” of the N.S.W, Legislative
Council, Mr. William Byrnes, a native of Sydney,
died at Parramatta, last Sunday, aged 84. He
was for 34 years a member of the somnolent
chamber.
If the late John Williams, Crown Solicitor,
had belonged to the horse-hair section of the law
he would have died Chief Justice of N.S. Wales.
The advantages of hair over brains are thus once
more demonstrated.
Jules Verne began life as a lawyer. He
couldn’t even defend a common drunk worth a
cent, however, so he gave it up. Some of the
people who got into gaol through being defended
by Verne are there yet.
The Melbourne Standard says that “ Mr.
Parnell is a remarkable judge of furniture.” The
way it says it seems to suggest that Parnell is
critically inspecting the great white throne to
make sure that sfpnmrp
ilie late uumi williams, had he lived)
would have celebrated the jubilee of his admis-
sion on a solicitor in May next. He served
articles with the late “ Bob ” Nicholls, as did
James Martin and “ Dick” Driver.
The oldest police-constable doing duty in
N.S.W. is “Neddy” Sooel, who for 35 years has
paraded the streets of Bathurst. Ned was “on
juty ” on the morning when the last public execu-
tion took place outside the old Bathurst gaol.
Sir Thos. M‘llwraith is now said to be a
£>..or man, and to be anxious to retire from politics
at the end of the year. Probably, Sir Thomas
has his fingers in so many pies that he doesn’t

Parkes says that he would be better
employed playing with a kitten than sitting in
such a Parliament as that of N.S. Wales now is.
The Bulletin rises to bet that whatever happens
Parkes will borrow the kitten, and get its milk
on tick.
Samples of remarks made on the Bench
by the frank and outspoken Pater, Police-Magis-
trate (S.A.):—“Go away and die.” “Go and
hang yourself—l don’t want to see you again.”
“I am ashamed of you—clear out.” “You are
not fit to live.” More to follow.
A plausible pieman named Thomas Skif-
fins has just been sentenced at Rockhampton, Q.,
to “ three years hard.” He had a balance of
6s. Id. way back in a Barcaldine bank, and passed
cheques to the extent of £lOl, pleading that he
had no idea he had “ overdrawn.”
“The sins of the father,” &c. There is
now no longer any reason to speculate as to the
cause of the Austrian Crown Prince’s suicide. He
had formed a liaison with a lady who was the
illegitimate daughter of his own Imperial father.
When the couple discovered this, they agreed to
die together.
Ebenezer Ward, M.L.C. (S.A.), who
a few days ago said he would “shoot the first
man who called him a Republican,” displayed his
true measure of pluck last week by piteously
claiming the protection of Parliament against a
fellow-member —Kirkpatrick—who attacked him
in the press !
Mrs, Dibbs, mother of Premier G. R.
Dibbs, of Mr, T. R. Dibbs of the Commercial
Bank, and of Mr. John 0. Dibbs, died at North
Sydney on the 21st, aged 82 years. She was a
very old colonist and a lady who was universally
esteemed. She leaves 20 grand-children and 12
great-grand-children.
Someone writes from England to the
daily papers that he is tearfully surprised to find
our gracious monarch such a small, thick and
dowdy person, in comparison with her Sydney
statue. The fact is, she would have been just
like the statue, only Providence used over much
of her material for circumference.
A Warrnambool (Vic.) man, being sued
for an account by a local chemist, swore in Court
that the plaintiff’s “ liver tonic ” was nothing but
pure whisky, sold almost openly over the counter.
He got verdicted against, and is to be prosecuted
for perjury. Thus happeneth it to the recreant
who roundeth on his private tap.
According to Pavkes, the doctor says that
all his organs are sound except his heart. Where
did that doctor look for Parkes’s heart ? If he
explored in the usual place then he might as well
have expected to find the old man’s liver in his
boots. Did it ever once dawn on him to hunt in
the patient’s pocket, for instance ?
Phil. May recently felt a longing to
draw Parkes once more for the sake of old associa-
tions, so he made a picture of the ancient one for
London Pick-me-up. And then the ignorant pro-
prietor labelled it “ Sir Henry Parker,” and Phil,
realised when he saw it that life was empty, and
everything was a hollow unreality.
Emperor William is said to have so far
recovered from the effects of his recent fall as to
be able to get about on his legs. This is fortunate
for him, for many of the German people are
getting into a state of mind which may result in
AN ILLUSTRATED PARAGRAPH.

Emperor can’t bolt fast enough on crutches.
Behold, this is Tummy :—Two Princes (of
Wales and of Saxony); three Dukes (of Cornwall,
of Rothesay, and of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha); three
Earls (of Chester, of Garrick, and of Dublin); one
Baron (of Renfrew); and Lord of the Isles of
Scotland; also two Privy Councillors, eight
Knights, and a tremendous variety of foreign
noblemen.
Poor old Frank Dunnett, well known in
old days in the Hobart Survey Office, had his
little all in the smashed-up Bank of V.D.L. The
crash killed him, for he quietly coiled up and died,
his last words being “ The Bank ! the Bank !
the Bank ! ” This is a pleasant reflection for some
people, and should lie heavy on many a moral
financier’s chest.
It is alleged that at Aix the Princess
Louise, Marchioness of Lome, was lately seen
imbibing brandy-and-soda and smoking cigars on
the balcony of the Casino. One evening recently
her highness executed a Highland dance, with all
its appropriate stamps and shouts, for the delecta-
tion of her own circle and incidentally for the joy
of many profane outsiders.
Mr. Pilcher, a'banker in Perth (W.A.),
has given up the overdraft business to join the
Church. We remember another bank-manager,
at Orange (N.S.W.), who became so godly that he
would not handle the money lodged by his
publican customers, but 'delegated the duty to an
assistant. He left the bank and went preaching,
but becoming “eccentric,” had to be sent to a
lunatic asylum.
Between 1835 and 1856 thirty-nine Angli-
can bishops died in possession of personal
property, exclusive of all real estate, varying in
amount from £12,000 to £140,000, the average
being about £54,000 each, and their total per-
sonalty over £2,000,000 sterling. The average
bishop doesn’t believe in a heaven evidently. If
he did he wouldn’t scramble so hard after the coin
of this brief earth.
Thus M. Leon Delbos, in his book
“ Pauvre Humanite,” on Salvationists and their
“ General ”;—
Vice and all the low instincts of the beast are written
on their countenances, which often have nothing human
about them. . . . Look at the head of their founder !
Have you ever seen anything more ignoble, more
diabolical ? The head is that of a bird of prey, the hands
are the claws of a vulture, the slender body that of a
s erpent, the eye is lewd and cruel.
Paul Kaye, a mining-expert sent up to
Cloncurry by a big Sydney shareholder in “ Last
Call ” gold-mine, to inspect and report on that
property, died at the Eddington Arms Hotel, on
the road between “Potter’s ” and Cloncurry.—
He wasn’t one of Booth’s elect.
So, where the dooce is Paul ?
He went the “ Last Call ” to inspect
And got his own last call.
Thistlewaite, prominent Melbournian, who
died last week, was Mayor of the model and
moral borough, Emerald Hill, when the Duke of
Edinburgh first visited Victoria, and it was he
who prayed that canny potentate to “bless” his
municipality with a visit. That so genuine a toady
was permitted to live for 24 years afterwards is a
strong argument for believing that the Archangels
don’t hanker after the society of flunkeys.
E. Cobcroft, aged 75 years, who retired
from the Forest Rangership of Singleton (N.S.W.)
District, on 19th December, ’9O, with a gratuity
of £125, has just been re-gazetted. He happens
to be father-in-law of Attorney-General Simpson.
The man who succeeded him in Singleton was
named John Smith and he happens to be brother
of the present Minister for Mines. Government
officials will somehow persist in being relatives of
prominent politicians.
A good old sport weighed out at Dubbo
(N.S.W.) on 20th Oct., when W. G. Orbell, host
of the Royal Hotel there, died. Those who were
travellers over the mountains in the early fifties
will remember him as a slashing driver, one of the
best and most daring whips that ever handled a
team. He left the roads in ’GO, and developed as
a publican in Hartley; afterwards ran another pub.
at Mount Victoria; and in 72 settled down in
Dubbo. He was about 55 years of age.
Mr, William Wilkin, formerly Under-
secretary for Public Instruction (N.S.W.), has
been appointed private secretary to the Executive
Commission to the Chicago Exhibition. This
gentleman has the good luck to bo pitchforked
into quite a lot of little billets ; but did not The
Bulletin understand that he retired from the
U.S.-ship because he had some incurable com-
plaint, which could only be alleviated by a large
pension. Where is that complaint now ?
Rudyard Kipling’s brother tills a fruit-
garden and makes jam (which he presents to the
neighbouring women), and lives the life of a
solitary bachelor in Northern Queensland. By
the way, an uncle of Kipling’s was a Methodist
lay-preacher and bootmaker in Melville-street,
Hobart Town in the fifties. His preaching wasn’t
very brilliant—whether his boots were brilliant or
not we haven’t heard. It is a tough contract to
be a great man’s relative, and there are few who
are equal to the job.
Mr. Tom Finney, of Brisbane—who was
incidentally alluded to in The BpLLKTiN as a
Roman Catholic —writes to state that he isn’t one,
but belongs to the Church of England. As a
rule, when The Bulletin says a man is a Roman
Catholic he has got to remain one, but, considering
all the circumstances of the case, Mr. Finney will
be let off this time. He may belong to the
Church of England, therefore, if he feels that
way. At the same time he is warned not to do
this sort of thing too frequently.
When the Irish collected £30,000 to free
Parnell’s estate from mortgage, the latter con-
sulted the O’Gorman Mahon as to whether he
should accept the money, adding that the O’G.
had better think over the matter for a day.
“Divil a think,” replied the O’Gorman Mahon.
“Oi decide at wanst that ye take the coin, so
that whin the Tipperary and Kilkenny people are
peltin’ yez wid shtones and mud a couple of years
from now ye can turn round and slap your pockets
at the blaggards.” The O’Gorman Mahon knew
mankind.
Sir Graham Berry seeks to excuse his
possession of the gewgaw of knighthood by the
assertion that he accepted the title “ as a public
dooty ” and an aid to the proper recognition of his
status among Australian Agents-General. A
hollow gag, this, which might be used to excuse
any defilement or grovelling. Doubtless, Berry
would accept a dukedom, or even the Imperial
Crown of Australia “as a public dooty.” Berry
is supposed to have his bright blue eye onColling-
wood, which seems to suggest that his title hasn’t
helped his intelligence much.
Governor Norman, cf Queensland, is a
modest, afternoon-tea sort of being, who looks
more like a meek and trodden-on curate than a
General. The Guv’mint ’Ouse crowd evidently
bores him, for he roams about the suburbs in a
solitary, unprotected way, or propels a canoe along
the river. He travels like an ordinary being in
an ordinary train, and does his best to offend no
one and to keep dark. But if he doesn’t stop
roaming about he’ll get lost one of these days, and
then some of the unemployed will find him and
claim a heavy reward for bringing him home.
Bananaland Legislative Assembly has
agreed to a vote of £2OOO, to be placed in trust
for the widow and family of the late J. M.
Macrossan, once the leader of the N.Q. Northern
Party and the legislative champion of miners. An
equal amount has already been raised by private
subscription. During his lifetime, Macrossan was
popularly credited with having feathered his nest
• —malicious people even went the length of hint-
ing at partnerships with public contractors, while
he was Minister for Works, but Jack successfully
lived down that scandal. Later on, when there
were many strange dealings with Mount Morgan
scrip in high quarters it was a popular fallacy that
Macrossan was “in it” and had made his pile.
But he was too honest to make his pile anywhere,
and he died poor.
M. Jules Gros, a composer of music-hall
songs, who died recently in Paris, once founded a
funny Republic—the Republic of Coumani—on a
tract of no-man’s-land, on the northern frontier of
Brazil, inhabited by Indians. He might have
founded a dynasty in those South American
forests, and lived and died President of Coumani,
but, sighing for fame, he established himself in
Paris and created a “Cabinet Council,” whose
chief business seemed to be to drink absinthe, and
to distribute the “ Order of the Star of Coumani ”
pretty promiscuously. France and Brazil repudi-
ated his claims, and the Government of British
Guiana politely advised him not to insist on
passing through its territory cn route to his
“republic.” So he returned to Paris and main-
tained himself by composing music and selling
“ the star ” till he died.
The Enfranchisement of Woman.
The leaders in office all over the world, and
especially in this continent, are proposing that
woman, or at least some of her, should have the
suffrage extended to her. Very well then. This
action is partly the inevitable answer that must
be made to the voice of the people, especially as
election times are approaching, and partly an
attempt to bolster up the iniquitous system of
plural voting which has received such a deatli blow
from the recent accession of workers’ represen-
tatives to Australian Parliaments. Whether or
not the departure will prove productive of gcod or
ill, whether the enfranchised woman will ncgleit
her house duties and vote for the ornamental
candidate with the curly golden beard to the
exclusion of the rugged Hampden, or the patriot
with odd eyes, is a matter that rests in the womb
of the future. Woman’s political enfranchise-
ment by the march of progress may be an umnixed
blessing or an undoubted curse. Woman’s dis-
enfranchisement from disease by the sterling
virtues of Warner's safe cure can be nothing but a
heaven-sent boon. The great number of com-
plaints from which our mothers, the past builders
of the world, and our wives and sisters, who are
to be the mothers of the next generation suffer,
vanish before the conquering remedies of H. H.
Warner & Co. Muscular weakness, tumors,
abscesses, and all the nameless ills known
generally as female complaints are evidences of
blood corruption, caused by the duties of
maternity, or the errors of dress, diet, and habits.
It is the special duty of the kidneys to keep the
blood pure and capable of doing its work, and
when tliis function is impaired only Warner’s
safe cure can restore it. Patients may reasonably
expect great results from the use of one or two
bottles, but four or six bottles are necessary in
some cases to produce permanent results. But
the results are so thorough that not one of the
thousands of Australian women thus restored to
the enjoyment of health would regret the use of
even ten times the quantity mentioned of the
famous safe cure were such a quantity necessary.

The monotony of Hobart life has just been
very much enlivened by an elopement, the
naughty ones being a scion of a bold clan,
formerly resident in the New Norfolk district,
and the dashing eldest daughter of a well-known
boarding-house proprietress in the solemn city.
The young lady had been locked up for a fort-
night on bread and water, quite in the old sweet
way, but managed to get out through the venti-
lator and join her tawny-moustached lover, who
was waiting on the ash-heap below, and, mounting
a parcels-delivery cart, they made for the steam-
boat and fled for Sydney, never more to part.

The marriage of Miss Annie Jeannette
Menzies, daughter of the late well-known hotel
proprietor in Melbourne, to Mr. Bertie Lyndsay
Hopkins, R.N., took place recently in London,
and was duly announced with a flourish of trum-
pets and a long list of guests in the pictorial
society papers. It was, in reality, a shoddy affair,
and the P. and O. and other merchant services
must have been raked up for men, judging by the
list of invited. The bride’s mother gave a big
blow-out, after the ceremony, at her house in
Devonshire Place. When the happy couple left
for the honeymoon they were accompanied to the
railway-station by nearly all the guests, who made
quite a sensation on the platform, throwing rice
and old shoes after the train. Someone tied an
old boot to the handle of the carriage, which
seemed to afford much amusement to the non-
descript crowd of idlers which collected to witness
the unwonted sight.

Something serious is going to come about.
A member of the Bulletin staff dreamt that
Queen Victoria was dead, and that the Sydney
D.T. published eight columns stating that it was
very glad she w'as gone.
Also, as a further sign of the times, we
dreamt last night that Parkes was deceased. It
was a weird and uncomfortable dream, for the old
man got square in his last moments by dying in
The Bulletin office, and his remains were in the
editor’s room. Then we called round on
Dan. O’Connor and Abigail and B. R.
Wise, and suggested that they should arrange
about the funeral, but they declined unani-
mously. Thereupon we decided to look
after it ourselves. We embezzled a cart some-
where and hired a lame black horse, and the
coffin was made in the dead of night in The
Bolletin cellar. The business manager disguised
himself in a slouch hat and a long murky cloak
and a dark lantern, and went out secretly at mid-
night with a muffled tread, and borrowed a big
tombstone from a stone-cutter’s yard in Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney. He nearly broke his back
getting it down as far as the Herald, and then
he hired a coffee-stall on wheels, and the granite
slab was put into it and run down to its destina-
tion. When it arrived there the coffee-stall man
was assassinated and buried in the cellar so
that he might not betray the secret, and his vehicle
was jerked into the harbour. These preliminaries
being completed, the deceased was conveyed into
the cart—he seemed to weigh as much as a
mountain of lead, and the whole staff was worn to
rags lifting him—and the coffin and the tombstone
were put in after him, and the black horse started
solemnly down a long black road that was lined
with poems and I O U’s. A skeleton man riding
on a skeleton mule went on in front, ringing a
dinner-bell, and in this order the procession
went straight ahead for eighteen years, through
a land where everything was black. Now
and then it stopped for refreshments, and
the refreshments were black also. Finally,
just as the funeral was getting well into its nine-
teenth year, and was still going, the horse sud-
denly turned round and asked if Parkes was
really dead. Being informed that he was, it
stated that it had nothing to live for now, and,
lying down solemnly in the roadway, it crumbled
into dust. Then the cart crumbled also, and the
coffin and the tombstone and Parkes all faded
away, and we started to walk back. And the last
thing we remembered was a milestone stating that
it was eighteen million leagues to Sydney, all up-

A Sandhurst (Vic.) bachelor—a women
and children hater also—while travelling to Mel-
bourne the other day, witnessed his fellow-
passenger, a young woman with a baby in her
arms, coolly strip the youngster, sponge it with
water from the train lavatory, powder-puff it all
over, and then put on it a nice, clean pinny.
Another horror is thus added to long railway
journeys.

Two advertisements from the Mittagong
(N.S.W.) Express :
Mr is not in my employ, or in any way connected
with me. £lO will be paid for every information of any
person obtaining work or money in my name, not legally
authorised.
The other man’s reply :
Mr. has no connection whatever with ——, and
wishes the public to take no notice of scandalising
him, as he is not answerable for what he says, and Mr.
considers that he ( )is not right in his head.

One of the Foreign-trade politicians of
N.S. Wales has a curious establishment in which
he lives after the manner of a large and copious
bear in a cave. The floors are washed about once
a year, and the carpets are a mass of rags caked
together by dirt. The grates are always blocked
up with yesterday’s ashes, and they are decorated
with great blots of ancient rust, as if the politician
habitually shot the slops out of his tea-cup at the
fireplace. The remains of the breakfast stand
about on the table till they get mixed up and
consolidated with lunch, and the latter meal
opens out like a telescope and elongates itself till
it hitches on to dinner. The water the politician
washed his hands in yesterday remains in the
basin in the bed-room till he wants to wash
his hands again to-day, and then he shoot
it out of the window, regardless of consequences.
The window-curtains are yellow and mangy, and
hang like a dead man on a gallows ; the window's
are mostly cracked ; the doors are all_ loose and
have a tendency to bang ; and the visitor gener-
ally enters a room head-first, because his feet get
hitched in the door-mat, which is a superannuated
dish-cloth and a man-trap. Things in general are
got rid of in that establishment by jerking them
out into the back-yard, and in the matter of
potato-skins and cobwebs the place stands alone.
And amid all this desolation the politician sits
around on a layer of dust, like an animal roosting
on an ash-heap, and seems quite content. His
children fall down-stairs promiscuously, for there
is always a bucket of water standing by accident ina
dark angle of the staircase, left there apparently by
somebody who was going to mop the house up, but
who abandoned the job in disgust and fled. His
clean shirt is usually in the cupboard on top of
the loaf, and his boots are in the dog-kennel. As
to his wife, she is either on top of the roof or down
in the cellar, for she is about the most casual
female going, and very hard to find when wanted.
A SUGGESTION.
MASHAM: “ I want some nice little thing for my wife— something that’ll please her. Perhaps
you could suggest something.”
SUE: “Yes, I think a telegram saying that a house had fallen on you, ought to please
her.”
Most of the work of the house is done by a little
girl, the daughter of an old, dead friend, whom
the politician took in when her father departed
this life —rumour has it that he shed tears by that
parent’s bedside, and told him that his_ child would
never, never want for a home and a lovin art so
long as he (the politician) was above ground. And
as that little girl has to wash up, and carry
buckets of water, and cook, and fly round on
errands, and make herself generally useful at all
hours of the day and night without salary, it is
evident that her adopted father kept his word.

Recently at Charters Towers (N.Q ) a
combination of dairymen issued a notice to the

We were invited to inspect a work of art
the other day. It was a costly thing, and purely
English, for the owner didn’t go in for Australian
art-lie explained that it lacked soul, and was
utterly deficient in that deep and ramifying com-
pleteness of expression and that profound yet sub-
dued consciousness which breathes in an ethereal
minor key through the masterpieces of the British
school. We suggested that perhaps the Austra-
lians didn’t slam on the paint hard enough, but he
said it wasn’t that—they lacked breadth of con-
sciousness. Then he showed us the picture and
struck a paralytic attitude in front of it. It was
a twilight-scene with a dark-green sea in it, and
dark-green clouds hurrying across a pale-green,
stormy sky. There was a greenish shore in the
foreground, and a blackish-green rock with mois-
ture and green slime on it. Beside it stood a tall,
vallerv-greenery female in corpse-coloured gar-
ments, and sadly -slowly-thoughtfully she
scraped her green face \ ith the nails of her green
hand, and looked out of her green eye at the sea
and the sky ; and everything was green and solemn
and very profound. And the owner looked at it
with profound joy on his face, and said that only
the genuine British artist knew how to put soul in
his work and to insert in it that deep and rever-
ent tenderness of expression of which true art is
composed.

Did you ever notice when a young widow
marries, it is always “widow,” and not “relict,”
that is in the marriage notice? Relict is too
much like relic.

“ Pentecost ” makes a suggestion :
When a human being is about to be born let him send
word to the State, and let the State appoint a commission
composed of one Republican and one Democratic political
ward boss, one monopolist, one trades-unionist, one
Malthusian, and one anti-Malthusian political economist,
and one representative of each religious sect, and let
them decide whether he may come into being or not.
What is the use of having a State unless we can make it
useful in guarding the exits and entrances to life ?

There was a fire one night recently in a
wooden house situated in a lonely locality some
miles from Auckland (M.L.), and the place blazed
joyously. By-and-bye the glare attracted the
attention of a man who was passing about a mile
away, and he ran like a racehorse for the scene of
action. As he got nearer he heard the screams of
a wild, distracted female, and, thinking that some
woman was being combusted, he ran still harder.
He took a bee-line across country, burst over
fences, and rushed right through gates because he
hadn’t time to open them. And when he got to
the spot ho found there a burning house already
more than half-consumed, and a female tearing
madly up and down the road, rending her hair
and crying in frantic accents “My child! my
child !” He took in the scene at a glance —the
heart-broken parent, the flaming house, and the
frizzled babe inside—and his manly heart rose
within him, and he took a header through the
window to save the offspring or perish in the
attempt.
Two other men came along after a while
and hauled him out. Most of his hair was gone,
and his only suit of clothes was wrecked, and his
preservers had to quench him by rolling him
violently in the dust. Then he sat up and
asked them to tell the heart-broken mother
gently that he hadn’t been able to find her
infant. They looked round for that shattered
parent, but couldn’t see any traces of her. Next
they started to search for her, and a crowd
gradually collected, and at last they learned that
she had been seen three-quarters of a mile away
walking contentedly towards home. She didn t
live in the burnt house at all, and she was an old
maid with no infant. She had simply been pass,
ing along the road, and had found a deserted
shanty on fire, and had there and then gone
into hysterics, and shouted for a lost child on
general principles. When she was tired yelling
she had recovered, and fixed up her hair, and
gone home, leaving the hero groping among the
ruins for a non-existent baby. These matters
were explained to him .as he sat by the roadside
and shook the ashes out of his hair, and he and
all the crowd took an oath that they would burst
into no more flaming buildings to look for any-
body’s offspring, unless the mother produced her
marriage certificate and the register of the infant s
birth in the first place, and supported her asser-
tions with an affidavit.

“Rolf Boldrewood’s ” new novel, “A
Sydney-Side Saxon,” is as readable and almost as
vigorous as his earlier works. It retains also
those anachronisms and those occasional incoher-
ences of stvle which are the characteristics of this
notable Australian writer. Four books in two
years, the whole of them published 10,000 miles
distant from the author’s home, and consequently
from the opportunity of revision, will account for
a good deal, but surely now that Mr. Browne has
established his reputation it is about time that he
should use the file upon his productions. W hen the
crudity disappears, the English critic cannot pos-
sibly find any other point to discuss, respecting
which his judgment would be worth a brass
farthing, and then he may give us a rest.
The Victorian Government has decided
that in future free railway passes shall be given
only to aboriginals, destitute persons, or charit-
able institutions. Therefore, the distinguished
globe-trotter will have to travel as a “destitute
person” or a “charitable institution,” or else
paint himself black and go partially naked.
In a northern railway-station not long
since a real live Judge was waiting for a train. A
crowd of school children were also present.
Having been provided with a chair, the public
functionary sat down and proceeded to pose in a
majestic attitude. Then suddenly he rose up and
spoke: “Station-master, come heah instantly.”
That official arrived at a run. “Lower those
blinds instantly ; there are some beastly boys out
there who had the impudence to lawf at me—at
me, sah, me, a Judge of the colony, sah! ”

There were several hitches in the proceed-
ings at Hobart when sports were held as an item
of welcome to the Auxiliary Squadron. One of
the worst was a cat’s-chorus competition between
the City Band and the Garrison Band. Both
bands had been lying low, and when the moment
arrived for Gov. Hamilton and Ad. Scott to para-
lyse the gathering, the old question of precedence
got up. So both bands tackled the Foreign
Anthem in separate keys, and the result sounded
like an earthquake in a pan-emporium, accom-
panied by dogs, yells, and fits.

The Victorian Sketching Club is a collec-
tion of about 22 enthusiasts, who have a rough
time of it in their pursuit of Art. They start
every Saturday at noon and travel into the wilder-
ness, and sit upon damp grass, and sketch cows,
and old boilers, and gasworks, and other features
of scenery. Last week the party arranged to visit
Black Rock, but the weather was bad and only
one sodden devotee turned up. He went to the
Rock alone and had just made his first pot-hook
when the blast arose and blew his sketch right out
of the world, and drove his coat-tail into his ear
and his ear into his pocket. He cursed a little
after that, and then the wind fell, and he got some
more paper out and was just about to knock spots
off Murillo when another hurricane buried his hat
and his paint and other materials under three feet
of mud. Then a bullock rushed him, and some-
body wanted to sue him for trespass, and he
started for home.

Lady Hamilton gave one of her dreadful
“ at homes ” in honour of the visit of the Auxiliary
Squadron to Hobart. These awful entertainments
are a superior class of tea-meeting in evening
dress. There is no recognised dancing, though
one or two waltzes are allowed after what is
facetiously called “ supper ”—a ghastly repast of
sugared buns and cruelly-weak negus. A high
intellectual tone is supposed to pervade these
entertainments; everybody looks intensely un-
comfortable, and nobody knows what on earth
to do, but, then, they are very “toney,” and the
proprieties are observed with agonising severity.
HIS PAINFUL HISTORY.
His heart was set on getting cash; lie late and
early sought it,
And cared not what the nature of the venture was
that brought it.
A miner at the start, ho delved among the
Northern ridges,
And afterwards he contracts took for mending
roads and bridges.
He next discovered that the town gave room for
more expansion,
And thither came and furnished out a fine subur-
ban mansion.
A bank one day he set afloat, a silver-mine the
morrow,
And bank and mine to all concerned brought joy
instead of sorrow.
He formed a syndicate and built a fleet of coastal
sailors,
And sent a company away to toil as South Sea
whalers.
He bought ramshackle cabins near the heart of
population
And turned them into dwellings for the people of
. high station.
And gold flowed out of everything on which he
operated,
Until he was the proudest man that ever specu-
lated.
’Twas then he took it in his head to start a great
diurnal,
A print that would show out ahead of every other
journal.
He nourished it upon his gold and afterwards he
fed it
With mortgages and lOU’s and every kind 6f
credit.
But people named the print “ a rag ” and called its
contents silly,
And now he’s back again among the ridges with
his billy !

A few weeks ago, Providence, or the other
fellow, got level with a N.S.W. Judge in a really
commendable way. He was on circuit in the
back-blocks, and was working at high pressure
to' get back to Sydney in time for a pompous
gubernatorial feed. The last day of the circuit he
kept the court going for 15 hours at a stretch,
and it was past midnight when the business was
disposed of. There were four young children
.among the witnesses to be examined ; it was a
cold day and raining incessantly, and for six
mortal hours those damp infants were kept hang-
ing about the steps of the courthouse, weary,
miserable, dejected, and full of coughs, snuffles,
and influenza. Then in the small hours of the
morning the prisoner was acquitted, or sent to gaol,
or sentenced to be hanged for 15 years with hard
labour and two floggings, or something, and the
next day the Judge started back by coach. On the
road Providence—or the other fellow—got square
with him, as already mentioned. The roads
were fearful, and the night came on black, murky,
and utterly impenetrable. The coach got bogged
11 times, and the judge got out and hauled and
shoved like a demon in a hundred sloughs and
mud-holes. Then a horse fell, and the Judge
helped to get it up again, and the animal kicked
a quart of mud into his eye. Next the harness
burst, and it was necessary to walk a mile and a
half and steal a clothes-line to repair it with.
Last of all, in the deepest bog of the lot, a wheel
gave out. At this stage the Judge said he would
take thh only horse of the team that wasn’t
utterly collapsed, and go on by himself, but the
driver told him briefly that he would see him
further first, and climbing on the animal himself
he cantered off into the slush and darkness.
Then the man of law gritted his teeth
together, and started to walk. It was 16 miles
to the railway ; the slush was two feet deep; the
rain came down _with a dull, monotonous persis-
tence, and the wind was moaning like a weeping
ghost among the hills. Two miles from the town
the driver—coming back with afresh vehicle—met
a spectre that was caked all over with mud and
using awful language on the highway, and conveyed
it into town in the gloaming of the early morning.
The gubernatorial feed was over—it had taken
place while the Judge was ploughing through the
dank morasses and dragging his legs out of in-
numerable bogs and ditches. There had been
champagne and burgundy, and rich choice soups,
and boned turkey, and luscious fruits, and much
grovel; and he had been thinking of them while
he crawled along with his clothes sodden, and his
boots in a state of pulp, and his bat soaked into
ruins, and his collar feeling like a damp halter,
and pints of slush in every pocket. And when,
about 4 a.m., he was thrown out on the doorstep
of a country public-house, he probably felt that
things were about level at last.

Governor Hopetouu attended the private
inspection of Melbourne Zoo. and said a few
things, some of which created a favourable im-
pression, while others didn’t. First he remarked
that the Zoo. was a credit to the “province.”
This shows that he has been reading The Bulle-
tin, as that paper abolished the term “colony ” and
put “province” in its stead ; but it excited the
politicians present, for, according to the Victorian
standard, “ colony ” is the only genuine word, as
may be seen by the wrapper on the bottle, all
others being false and seditious. Secondly, Hopc-
toun tried to whistle a Scotch tune, and his voice
has an awful tendency to fly off the handle, in a
manner of speaking. 'Thirdly, he tried to feel the
macaw’s teeth, and that amiable bird swallowed
the viceroy’s arm right up to the elbow and had
to be beaten off with a sapling, else it would have
swallowed the viceroy altogether. Taking it all
round, Hopetoun had a good time.

Some unknown person who doesn’t sign
his letter writes as follows from London :
Mr. J. Troubridge Critchell presents his compliments to
the Editor of the Sydney Bulletin, and begs to forward
for his inspection a letter which has first appeared in the
Times written by Mr. Critchell. As a communication
addressed to the English press last May, giving the views
of the Rev. Charles Clark on the Australian Labour Ques-
tion, was submitted by the editor to the delicate and
refined criticism for which Tub Bulletin has become cele-
brated, Mr. Critchell thinks it possible that the present
innocent effort of an old Australian to benefit his colony
may merit the censure of the editor. Acting on his belief
that the abuse of the Sydney Bulletin is praise indeed,
Mr. Critchell hastens to afford to the editor the oppor-
tunity to express once again his dislike to all colonists
who venture to hope that Australasia has nobler aims
than those preached in the columns of the Svdnev
Bulletin. j
We have inspected the letter which “first appeared
in the Times,” and find it to be a wild woosh of
figures about the number of cows in Queensland.
It presents the general appearance of a multiplica-
tion table struck by lightning, but otherwise it is
quite harmless. Therefore, we will let it pass,
and Mr. Critchell can exist a while longer. At
the same time that person is hereby admonished
to walk a chalk-line in future, else The Bulletin
may rise up and abolish him.

The Salvation frenzy is spreading. The
other day a bleary old gin was to be seen wander-
ing down Queen-street, Brisbane, in full Salva-
tion costume, with her ancient, weather-worn nose
shaded by her poke bonnet, and her capacious feet
flopping along in the narrow way that leads unto
the bright and shining gate. She was saved, and
had sworn off, as could be seen by the awful look
of thirst in her haggard eye, and the hungry way
she stopped and sniffed at the door of each bar
she came to. Also there was a sort of uneasy hop
in her walk, which had evidently been acquired
by dancing through the mud in pursuit of the
tambourine. She was a dejected old black wreck,
)ufc she was still recognisable. Years ago she
belonged to a fragment of a tribe that camped on
the river-bank near Hamilton, and in these days
she was a fighting female, and it was a refreshing
spectacle to see her knock her husband out on the
highway. Then when the old man had enough of
it she would swear copiously, and dash road-metal
through the hotel windows, and curse through the
broken panes, and when the barman came out to
remonstrate she would leap high in the air with a
yeii, and kick his ear with the soles of her feet.
And now she plods humbly tl'rough theslush behind
the drum, with her poke bonnet put on hind side
in iront, and her military days are over. What
a fail is there for the daughter of the soil.

A c 6i'tain bloated landlord of Fitzroy
{Victoria) is hereby invited to come outside and
shy mud and ignominy at his own degraded horse-
carcase. A young married woman, deserted by
hei husband, had rented a room in his house for
some months. When her confinement arrived she
was almost starving. She got over her trouble
somehow (Providence only knows how), but before
the child was two weeks old the mother and infant
were both reduced to utter destitution. Then the
woman, who had been honest so long as she had
n0 , 01 !® to s h ar e her misery, stole the blankets
and pillows from the bed and pawned them for
food and medicine, and her landlord promptly ran
her in, 1 here are seven different Parliaments in
Australasia, and they all peg in making laws for
about nine months in the year, but among them
all there isn’t even a single law, so far as we know
to authorise tying a preacher to that landlord and
shoving him head first into an active volcano.
Put if a large, solid, whole-souled curse can pene-
trate his moral hide he has it unanimously.

THE N.S.W. POLITICAL CRISIS AND THE MELBOURNE CUP.
SMITH: “Well, what do you think of the crisis?”
JONES: “Crisis? Didn’t know he was in the Cup, but I should think you can get about
100 to 1."
the gilded denizens of “ onr village ” has set up an
Bft. Gin. snake, and when he wanders about on
the shore with the reptile hanging out of his
pocket he is a pleasing sight. Sometimes he has
it suspended round his neck for a change, and at
other times he carries it in his hand, and then for
variety he will throw it over his shoulder and let
the end of it trail behind him, and the rest of the
time he carries it anyhow. When he sits down any-
where the snake coils up beside him, and his dog
hangs round and licks it; or sometimes the snake
licks the dog for a change and makes that animal
somewhat damp and slimy. At night, we pre-
sume, the reptile hangs itself up on its owner’s
bed-post, or else throws itself loosely over the
towel-rail, but this is mere conjecture.

The English commercial papers report
that Indian tea is rapidly superseding the Chinese
article in the markets of Europe. We are glad to
hear this. There was something that looked like
a fragment of Joss floating in our cup the other
morning; it wasn’t very distinguishable, but it
certainly seemed to be a bit of a Chinese god of
some description ; and we object to drinking gods
out of an Asiatic pantheon. When the Chow
begins to drop his deities into the tea, he is
treading on the finer feelings of the white race,
and something is going to happen.

According to an English paper there is a
girl in one of the London workhouses who speaks
a language that nobody can understand except
herself. It is presumed that she does understand it,
but even this point is not certain. She looks like
an English female, but the parish has lost the run
of her, in a manner of speaking, and nobody is
quite certain where she came from. All the pro-
fessors within reach have tried to locate her, but
without success. Some of them think she invented
the language herself, and others imagine that she
is the last girl of some lost nation which every-
body has forgotten, but nobody gets any nearer a
solution of the mystery.

According to one of a series of sketches
now running in Paris Figaro, Napoleon the
Small, notoriously catholic in his love for the sex,
was crossing one of the salons in the Tuilleries ere
the lamps were lit, and, attracted by a shapely
ankle that protruded from a mass of drapery on a
sofa, pinched the limb appended. The head that
emerged thereupon was that of the Bishop of
Nancy.

Mudgee (N.S.W.) Hospital Committee

pone dying ! The doctor broke this rule recently,
and now the committee want him to pay the

Fifteen thousand pounds worth of old
man was lying on his death-bed, and his wife was
in an interesting condition. He called for a
lawyer and dictated a will destined, as he thought,
to meet any emergency. If the child was a boy,
the mother was to get £5OOO for herself, while
£lO,OOO was to be invested on trust for the son
and heir. If the new-comer was a girl, the
mother was to get £lO,OOO, while only £5OOO went
to a trust fund. Then the old man died happy.
The widow shortly afterwards gave birth to twins
—a boy and a girl. And now there is much riot
among the lawyers as to whether the boy-half of
the twins is not entitled to £lO,OOO and the girl-
half to £5OOO, and the mother to —the balance, it
being argued that her legacy was purely a con-
tingent one. Ihe Court informs the widow that
she has placed herself outside the will by an act
of contributory negligence, but the widow wants
to know what the Court thinks she should have
done about it, and the Court can’t tell her. Just
where the exact division comes in isn’t at all clear,
but by the time the lawyers have fixed it up,
there’ll be nothing to divide.

The Tasmanian customs authorities have—
or one of them has—prohibited the introduction
of “ Robert Elsmere ” as a book that is unfit for

microscope grows wearisome—but the official ass
who would pile up his anathema on it as an offen-
sive publication hasn’t intelligence enough to get
out of bed without legal assistance.

fear of being included in a census paper, and the

Old, sunburnt Bananalanders know how
to observe their democratic points. When Gover-
nor and Lady Norman visited a seaside resort of
that province recently, a veteran drove his Ex.
round in one vehicle, while a bright young damsel

a pretty place,” remarked General Norman,
pointing to a picturesque residence. “ Who lives
there?” “ The mother of the lady who is driving

“ A Housekeeper ” writes to a London
editor, growlingly, that, if he wants to persuade
people to be teetotallers, he ought also to suggest
some way of making either provisions cheaper or
incomes larger. Says the hash-mistress :
I can feed a man on ten shillings a week, with plain
wholesome food and a quart of beer a day, but a teeto-
taller eats such an immense quantity that he cannot be
fed at the same price. They say “ A Christian has the
privilege of self-denial,” and denies himself the pleasure
of drinking. Yea, verily ; but you should see him eat!

The people of Cairns (Q.) are troubled
because they got up an expensive printed and
illuminated grovel to the captain of the ironclad
Ringarooma, and he left the document lying in a
corner of the hotel when he went away. At latest
a teetotal lecturer had got the publication and
was showing it off as a picture of the inflamed
stomach of a drunkard.
The S.M. Herald declares that it can
possess what it calls its soul in patience anent the
intentions of the Dibbs Ministry on “ the subjects
of electoral reform, courts of conciliation, and
other similar ones.” Then it adds with the grate-
fulness of a corn-fed stomach :
We may be sure that when anxiety is expressed as to
what the Government policy will be no reference is in-
tended to second-rate matters such as these.
What, then, is the S.M. Herald’s idea of a
first-rate” matter? The “Bone-Idler,” we pre-
sume, and the Echo’s solitary joke, and the con-
gregational tea-meeting, and the ponderous review
of the ponderous scientific book upon the hind legs
of microbes, and things like these. And it will
worry drearily over these leaden topics till some
day it falls over a second-rate matter and breaks
its back and dies in some hospital for decrepit and
incurable literature.
It is most convenient to have a lirst-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
According to the D.T report, Johnston,
M.L.A., declares that if Dibbs tries “to tinker
with the tariff, ’ the Labour party will say “ out
you go.” The Bulletin hereby tells Johnston
that he is putting both feet in it. The country
elected most of the Labour members as protec-
tionists. By doing so it demonstrated that the
two things it wanted were Protection and Demo-
cratic Reform, and if it is compelled by the foolish-
ness of its own representatives to do without
one of them, it may rise and throw out
Johnston and get some more efficient democrat in
his stead. Moreover, the party claims to have
sunk the fiscal issue,” yet it voted for Foreign-
trade in return for Parkes’s promised concessions.
Therefore, if Dibbs will offer similar concessions it
must now vote for Protection in return, otherwise
it hasn’t sunk the fiscal issue at all, but is going
bald-headed for cheap Chinese goods and imported
British shoddy and the extinction of local indus-
try in general.
Now that Carruthers has vamoosed Into
the vasty oblivion which sooner or later swallows
up every hanger-on to Parkes’ coat-tails, what is
going to become of that wretched School History ’
The first thing the new Minister for Education
should do is to knock the whole thing on the head,
although the procedure would have pretty much
the character of sticking a knife into the dead.
We are not referring to Lusk’s association with
the book, -but to the twaddleful, petticoated
creatures of the Department, when we say that
the thing has been tinkered at till it is a mere
hash of Barrington’s, Braim’s, Lang’s and Suther-
land’s histories with a strong dose of Freetrade
essence extracted from Parkes’s speeches and
Carruthers’ Young Men’s Society essays. If the
thing wanted incessant patching" up, why was the
prize-money paid over, and if it wanted nothing
of the kind, why was it tinkered, and why has it
not been published ?

Safe democratic motto ; “ Where you see
a crowned head, hit it.”
The Queensland Patriotic League is a
body built on the same lines as the N.S. W. bogus
“ National ’’ Association. It has also exactly the
same programme, one of its objects being “to
uphold a just balance of electoral representation.”
It is now upholding the said balance. The
members of the League are all bulgy money-
lenders, bankers, merchants, squatters, and the
like, and almost all the J.sP. belong to it. These
individuals are now revising the electoral roll, and
are knocking off the names of working men by
hundreds. The process is very simple. The
revising justices call no evidence, ask no questions,
give no reasons, and offer no chance of explana-
tion. They simply say that they have “cause to
believe ” that about two or ten consecutive pages
of names are wrongfully on the roll because the
owners have “changed their residence,” or some-
thing of the sort, and what is the “cause” that
led them to believe that circumstance isn’t ex-
plained. Then they knock off six or eight streets
of working men in one act, and the job is
finished.
A new penny weekly has been started in
Melbourne for the benefit of those quaint
fogies who are fond of bartering old socks for
Limburger cheeses and bustles for cheap
oleographs. It is called the Exchange and
Mart, and some of its advertisements read
humorously:—One joker wants “a fender and
hearth-rug ” for “ an odd lot of carpenter’s tools
a matron asks for “ a portable copper and peram-
bulator ” for a sewing-machine; an artist offers a
“tin box of oil paints” for a “violin bow;”
another musical aspirant would give a carpet for
a “ second-hand violin a chap who must have
lost his vocation demands a “cedar sideboard and
four chairs ” for an “ incubator ” with “ 200 eggs,
good order ’’—which means probably half-hatched
or half-addled ; a sport offers a “ young talking
magpie” for a “Newfoundland pup a come-
downer is willing to give a “bowl of goldfish in
exchange for six antimaccars ” (sic); and —grisly
terror of all!—an afflicted cuss offers a “second-
hand set of false teeth and plait of golden hair ”
for “a cork leg!” There are lots of less
interesting offers of barter. The writer will be
glad to exchange an impediment in his speech and
a Revised Version for a squint and a good, whole-
some, reliable, whisky breath.
Parkes’ last official act was to find profit"
able jobs at the public expense for about eleven of
his broken - down friends, hangers - on, and
acquaintances. Some of the gang were unknown
to the public, and why they should have billets is
incomprehensible; the rest are too w r ell-known,
and why they shouldn’t have billets is obvious to
the naked eye. The jobs have mostly good
salaries attached, and no visible hard work.
About six nondescript cripples—one of them over
seventy years of age—are to do some unspecified
gyration in connection with the Chicago Exhibi-
tion. Somebody else is to fool round in connec-
tion with an alleged Exhibition in Tasmania—
which Exhibition Parkes formerly denounced as
being too small a show to be worth official notice.
The eternal Oscar Meyer—who seems to live to a
great extent on exhibitions —is to look after some-
thing. The still more eternal John Davies—the
public apparition with the three old hats—is to be
some kind of an official Bumble about the
National Park. All of them are to send in the
bill to their bleeding country, and all these
appointments were made by Parkes after he had
resigned office, and when he had ceased to have
any moral right to appoint anybody. Whether
he had or had not any legal right is an open
question, and one that is worth a good deal of
inspection.
An 18-ffc. alligator got impounded in a
Chinaman’s fish-trap up at Cairns, N.Q., the other
day, and most of the local population turned
out to try and effect its death or capture. Vain
attempts were made by daring hunters to spear
the saurian, to waddy it into insensibility, or to
boathook it hors de combat. Then an enterprising
torpedo enthusiast laid a mine of dynamite under
its off-hind wing, and started the fuse going, while
everybody retired to a safe distance. Nothing
came of it, however, and, after a half-hour’s
anxious waiting, the assemblage returned to
reconnoitre and found that the reptile had
swallowed dynamite, fuse and all. A combined
attack was now made to capture the scaly one
alive, according to the rules of “ Baste the Bear,”
the’gator being “bear.” The ironclad varmint
proved excellent in this rdle and after chasing the
bipeds all over the trap for a diverting hour or so,
during which he gorged four pairs of pants, nine
pairs of shoes and an odd Wellington boot, a
gaiter and a half, three spurs, 17 stockwhips, two
dogs, square yards of wire netting, half a
Mongolian leg, and a few pounds weight of
various explosives, he suddenly steeplechased over
all barriers and took a header into the deep.
These old ways of killing the alligator are no good.
The only sure thing is to blast the animal with
electricity or else induce him to take shares in a
building society.
A second edition of that most successful
book, The Bulletin’s Illustrated “ History of
Botany Bay,” is now ready. A copy wih be
mailed to any Australian address for Is, 4d. in
stamps.
Hundreds of persons suffer from boils, car-
buncles, and other eruptive diseases. These are
evidences that the system is trying to purge itself
of impurities, and that it needs the powerful aid
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

SPORTING NOTIONS
With Carbine, Melos, Vengeance, Dreadnought,
Bungebah, and such olddehisive identities as Tradition and
U hakawai already.scratched for the Melbourne Cup, the
public are watching the belting-market with a dull, lishy
eye, and vaguely wondering what to morrow may bring
forth. Their faith in legs is shaken. Their best idols lie
Baaltered ip (he dust. A good d ea l of their annual en-
tluisiiin is, for the moment, gone bung.
* # #
It is a pity that Carbine’s ligament couldn’t
ha\ e hung together for another two or three weeks,
because the old hero would, in the opinion of hi? trainer
and jockey, have shown the fleld his tail and pulled the
punters through once again. Anyway, he would have
spared his early supporters the grief and pain of trying to
recover the money that has gone down the sink.
* * #
Before Tirailleur came over, the Maoriland
people sent word that he was another Carbine, only more
bo. At Flemington he doesn’t seem to please anybody
though ; he doesn’t look as first-class as his performances,
and the . proverbial screw is probably loose in this good
horse. So with his relative, Cuirassier, apparently, and
with several others too mediocre to he worth mentioning.
Among horses that are being backed .for more or less
money, at time of writing, it is easy to name .several that
no prophet could show reasonable cause for .selecting as
winners. Pigeontoe, Forty Winks, Forest King, Whim-
hrel, Glenlpth, Oxide, G’Naroo, Sir William, The Tyler,
and Stromboli are none of them good enough, on paper,
ti win this Melbourne Cup. Either they have given no
sort of evidence of ability to win a fast-run race over two
miles, or else they have never shown the form necessary
to give a fair “paper” chance of victory under their
weights. Granted, that there may be no real first-
class horses in this year’s race—what has Whimbrel done
to mike him a very likely horse to get home with only
a pound less than Bravo carried? Or do Sir William’s
recent performances suggest that he can repeat the
B avo record? G’Naroo hasn’t a fifty to one chance of
winning under Bst. 1 libs., nor do any of those that
(unshed behind him in the Caulfield Cup catch the eye as
possible good things for the big handicap.
# * *
This is a year for a three-year-old to repeat the
Martiui-llenry trick, provided that a youngster within
coo-ee of Mr. White’s brilliant animal is included
amongst the entries. At present the stable companions,
Zahnski and Strathmore, look like the best of their year,
and if either or both of them start next Tuesday they will
certainly beat two-thirds of the Held. Zalinskicommands
respect as the half-brother to Trenton, but the weight;
to he carried by this fine colt and good recent per-
former is pounds more than any three-year-old has yet
put on the record. Strathmore, on the other hand, is
nicely weighted. By Nordenfeldt out of Correze’s dam.
he is handicapped at five pounds less than Correze carried
into third place last year. A Derby victory, of course
would mean a heavy penalty for Strathmore, but common
sense points to the probability of Zalinski being the stable
horse for the Derby, inasmuch as a win in Saturday’s
event would not increase the latter’s weight for the Clip
Should Strathmore go for the Derby the public may take
it for granted that Zalinski is a stone better colt, or else
that Mr Wilson despairs of getting a 6st. 121bs. boy to
ride Correze’s brother in the two mile race, and is there-
fore indifferent about incurring the penalty which
attaches to the classic blue riband. But it must not be
forgotten that only a phenomenal three-year-old can pull
off the Melbourne Cup under any weight, and nothin"-
short of a four lengths win in the Derby would justify
punters in pinning their entire faith to a youngster for
the £lO,OOO handicap.
*# # ,
To the writer’s way of thinking, Highborn ought
to beat all the horses that finished behind him last
Kovembev save Correze. Muriel is a mare likely to run
well, yet on the Sydney Cup form she has decidedly the
worst of it with Highborn. However, when one comes to
think of it, very few of last year’s competitors will turn
up again this journey. Between Highborn and Grevgown
it is difficult to choose ; probably most students of the
weight-for-age scale will make .out the mysterious grey
horse to be “ better in ” than the trusty Highborn. Cer-
tainly his performances indicate that he has a more
brilliant dash than the older horse, and it is a fact that
the astute Maitland swears Grevgown has a soft thin" on
at Flemington. The Bulletin will take Correze to beat
Greygown, nevertheless. Looking through the book it
appears that Correze has twice won from him, givino-
him nine pounds on one occasion. On the score of looks’
Correze has the advantage, too. He is a sweet
little horse, another Mentor in make and shape
and about his ganreness there can be no question at all.’
VVith good health and a good run Correze will not finish
behmd more than one or two horses at most, and he
should be the best “place” spec, in the race. Of which
there is no manner of doubt, no possible doubt whatever.
Megaphone, although bound to be up amongst them at
the finish, cannot be regarded as a dead bird. He ran
like a moderate animal behind Marvel at Caulfield while
to win with 9st. odd in the saddle he would need to be a
clinker, anyway. Cobham’s form is very difficult to
arrive at, and his second to Marvel, at Randwick, is an
unknown quantity. Marvel might perchance have been
equal to giving him another two stone. At Flemington
however, Cobham is well liked, his breeding is unexcep-
tionable, and it would be a rash tipster who said this fine
horse had no chance for the Cup. Au contraire, as the
Chinamen say, there are no substantial grounds for nut-
ting one’s boots on him. *
* * *
At time of writing Malvolio and Paris are
equal first favourites. Malvolio has one noteworthy per-
formance to his credit, viz., a defeat of Highborn in a
email race and when in receipt of ten pounds. The son
of Malua is a handsome horse, and is alleged to be
capable of staying two miles, but there is absolutely
no reason for supposing that he is better qualified
to win a Melbourne Cup than the overrated Benzon.
trained in the same stable, has been for the past two
years. On paper, Malvolio is not good enough to back at
a short price, let him win the Cup or not. Paris strikes
one as a quadruped of quite another colour. His last
three tries have been wins, and his Doncaster Handicap
race stamped him as a flyer. In the Rous Handicap,
again, he beat Correze easily at seven pounds, the weight
he receives from the chestnut in the Cup. Finally Paris
comes from the dangerous Marvel crowd, has been tried
equal to winning a Melbourne Cup, and goes like a little
steam-engine on the track. All going well, he will start a
warm first favourite, and The Bulletin expects him to
win. Back Paris and die. Should he break down before
ine race, you can retire into a corner and meditate over
the glorious uncertainty of the turf.
* • #
TheTyl®., after he was so badly beaten at Rose-
niil, had a go with Cobham at Randwick, when Cobham
had to cry second best. The Tyler party were much cut
ip over the defeat at Rosehill, as they supported him at
le ' el money and expected almost a walk over The
greatest knock, however, is the fact that they have the
horse backed to win £40,000 in the Melbourne Cup -it
Hundreds to one or two, and, had he won at Rosehill, his
price would now be hundreds to five or thereabouts, and

—“What will destroy silver-fish and moths?”
ihe idea that camphor or pepper will suffice to
keep these small fiends at bay is exploded long
since, as thousands of housekeepers know to their
sorrow. Ladies will, therefore, rejoice to know
that one Matusa Komo, of Tokio, Japan, has
discovered a certain destroyer of these pests, and
has named it “No-mi-yc-kee.” It has been proved
to be most efficacious in destroying insect-life, and
should be of great value to every householder.

that popular malady, influenza, find that every
now and then they are attacked by such fits of
utter prostration, consequent upon the suffering
they have undergone, that life is but a burden to
them. 1 his shows they need a strong brain and
nerve tonic, and no better can be recommended
than Halliday’s Celery, Beef, and Iron Tonic.
Celery as a nerve tonic is simply marvellous,
whilst the extract of beef is well-known as a
strength-giver, and iron as an enricher and purifier
of the blood has no rival. By the scientific com-
bination of these three grand properties the'very
best and most palatable Tonic of the day is

The infant who plays at hanging is one of
the pleasant results of the modern social system.
The other day sundry children at fronton (Ohio,
U.S.) organised a court, and three youngsters —-
two brothers and a sister —were solemnly tried
and sentenced to death. Then they were locked
up in a tool-chest —presumed to be the condemned
cell—and the others forgot to hang them —in fact
they forgot all about them and went home. Result
arrived at a day or so later—three dead infants in
a chest.
I Sixteen years ago, near Clermont, a
| Queensland police officer whipped one of his
black troopers to death with a split-leather saddle-
girth. The mates of the dead boy reported the
matter, and the officer was arrested on the charge
of murder, and committed—bail, of course, being
refused. However, the trial hung fire from term
to term, and in the meantime the prisoner’s wife
came into a fortune. The oracle was worked in
some way, and the officer was released on bail—
£soo in his own recognisances, and £5OO from a
friend. Of course, the bail was jumped, and from
that day to this Queensland has known him no
more. The legend now runs that he is still alive
and prosperous, and can be found any day, if the
Griffith Government wants him. Possibly, how-
ever, the Griffith Government doesn’t want him.
THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
lit. It is in one word a cure ; it is not merely
a relief, and in no sense a cure-all; it is the pro-
duct of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is superadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently ; search-
mgly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
• >th. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
lor rheumatism, neuralgia, sprains, bruises,
stiff joints, swellings, and similar ailments St.
■lacobs Oil has positively no equal if used accord-
t° the directions which accompany each bottle.
Aches and pains succumb in a truly marvellous
manner to the potent influence of this world-famed
remedy. thousands of testimonials have from
tune to time been published in the Australian
press—- testimonials from all ranks and conditions
of men—from salesmen, judges, eminent divines,
barristers, the medical profession, merchants,
athletes, &c. ; and although a large standing
reward has been offered to any one who could
produce proof that any one of these was not
strictly genuine, none have dared to question their
authenticity. Under these circumstances is it to
be wondered at that the sale of St. Jacobs Oil
greatly exceeds the combined sales of all other
advertised lotions, liniments, embrocations, &c.,
in the world ? No home can afford to be without
a bottle of it always handy, and purchasers would
do well to observe that they get the genuine
article, and not one of the many spurious prepara-
tions made up to trade upon the enormous reputa-
tion which St. Jacobs Oil has built up for itself
upon the solid foundation of merit.

THE ENTERPRISING YANKEE.
I lo produce a watch so simple in construction'
I that it could be sold cheaper than any other, and
I still be a reliable timekeeper, has been the problem
for watchmakers the world over. The Swiss
| developed the making of watches by hand to the
I highest point, at the same time cheapening hand
labor to the utmost possible extent. The
I Americans sought a solution in a different
direction by making the parts of their watches by
machinery, and interchange. However, the cost
of manufacture still remained too great for the
watch of the million. An enterprising Yankee
company finally solved the problem by dispensing
with the greater number of parts of a watch
(reducing the number from 160 to 57!), making all
of them by machinery, and so easy of adjustment
that expert labor was not needed to put them to-
[ gether. This crowning achievement in the history
of watchmaking was accomplished by the Water-
bary Watch Company in their Waterbury Watch
which, though cheap, is as perfect in its parts and
as reliable in its time-keeping as any watch made.

The Melbourne beaks the other day fined
one woman twenty shillings for being drunk, and
another one ten shillings for a murderous assault.
Which goes to show that the average beak should
be assaulted himself to give him a more general
idea of things.
We have received—presumably for review
—a wierd-looking publication, on the cover of
which is a picture of a lady with her head in the
fire. Another lady is holding her down, and in
retaliation she is taking a huge mouthful out of
the other lady and tearing her hair. There are
sundry broken chairs and shattered gin-bottles
about the room, and a gaunt black cat is cater-
wauling on the table. The contents of the volume
are well up, in a general way, to the standard of
the frontispiece, and are suggestive of a moral
ghoul stirring up an ancient slop-barrel with a
dead snake.
Charters Towers (according to the local
Evening News) is a suicidal maze of unprotected
shafts, unfenced lakes, ragged masses of broken
machinery, heaps of rubbish, tailings, holes, bogs,
pitfalls, ravines, ruts, gutter-ways, stinks, Chinese,
goats, dogs, aldermen and other frightful var-
mints. Says the paper: “ There never was a
town on the face of the globe where suicide is less
necessary, and where it is easier to make a decent
thing out of life-insurance, whether as an agent or
policy-holder.” Good—
Time was, at Broken Hill, when a rever-
ential worshipper of a putty-footed idol presented
the then Municipal Council with a portrait of
Parkes. At that time, hanging space for works
of art was not available, so the mayor lugged
the portrait home and stuck it in his dining-room.
The Broken Hill town hall was built in due
course, and when the old mayor resigned his seat
he also handed over the portrait to be hung in the
official premises. Strangely enough, the Council
cursed when they -saw it, and seemed to take the
thing as a personal injury. In fact, the burninsr
question now in Broken Hill is : “ Where shall
we hang this ’ere Parkes?” The new mayor
won’t have him in his parlour ; the aldermen look
coldly on the painted apparition; the librarian
says his premises are crowded up; the fire brigade
regret their space is limited ; and the town-clerk
has taken the portrait in temporarily and under
protest, and wants it shifted at once. Some day
Parke’s portrait will be dashed down an aban-
doned shaft, to judge from present appearances.
Two negroes, breaking gaol at Raleigh,
U.S.A., weVe awarded 39 lashes, and it was
suggested that the sentences should be inflicted in
public, an admission of 25 cents being charged.
The prisoners agreed to the arrangement on con-
dition they should receive the gate-money. There
are a few tons of suggestiveness in this item, and
poor, hard-up Treasurer MTlwraith ought to wel-
come it as a means of filling the State coffers.
By the way, what are the State coffers ? The
Treasury of one Australian province once con-
sisted of an old portmanteau. Bromley, the naval
officer, lost the thing, and the “ colony ” set an
example—which has been followed times without
number since, by other colonies —of going bung.

Brisbane Observer came out the other
day with headings in the following sequence—
ROCKHAMPTON RECORDS.
Good Sign.
Death of a Solicitor.
The Observer need not have expressed its
jubilation as brusquely as all that.
N.S. Wales is threatened with a new
curse. Parkes’ latest big portrait is to be repro-
duced as an oleograph. When this is done the
coming Protectionist Government will order a
large supply, and stick one up in every State
school throughout the land as an awful warning
to the coming generation, and as the surest means
of keeping Parkes out of office for all futurity.
The other day a man aged 70 was brought
up before Chief Justice Darley, charged with a
serious assault. The only defence was insanity,
and when this plea broke down the Chief Justice
congratulated the prisoner, in a friendly way, on
his narrow escape from lifelong confinement in an
asylum. Then, with a beaming smile, he sent
him to break stones and live in a whitewashed
cell for ten years, and seemed to expect that the
old wreck would look glad over it.
A Queensland paper tells an unfinished
story about a bush man who went round Brisbane
for several days drinking and swearing in company
with an affable stranger, whom he afterwards dis-
covered to be a lord. The story —like all such
stories —ends abruptly just when the lord revealed
himself. We presume that it is intended to con-
vey by this that the bushman fell paralysed into a
plate-glass window when he discovered that he
had been drinking with a peer—at all events the
climax seems to be taken for granted somehow.
The Triad (secret Chinese) society in the
Northern Territory of S.A. has at least 400
members, who pay annually a fee of from 10s. to
£2, according to their social status. It is the
refuge of criminals of all types. The Triad
defends its own members whenever accused in the
courts, and has spent as much as £4OO in defending
a criminal, while it has often, by manufactured
evidence, sent innocent people to gaol. It has
three known places of meeting—Palmerston, The
Union and Yam Creek. Its meetings are con-
vened by the sign of a certain flag, and it has
secret signals and pass-words.
The courteous American editor once more
goes for the man who runs the rival paper :
He is a squint-eyed, consumptive liar with the breath
of a buzzard and the record of a convict—a poor, sallow,
slimy lizard—a mildewed, corpse-faced creature—a red-
nosed scavenger with blue mould and the dropsy. We
have looked at him long and earnestly and recognised in
him the features of a razor-backed, lop-eared, sag-bellied,
corner-toed wolf-whelp. He is a fiendish atrocity, a
twisted, warped, livid, glass-eyed, greasy freak who com-
bines a two-weeks-old corpse in the river with a cross-
section of a morgue on a busy day.
This sort of thing would almost seem to imply
that he doesn’t like the other man.
Directly any sect of devout believers
emerges from thd chrysalis state of contempt or
persecution, and basks in the sun of popularity, it
begins to be implacable, remorseless, and per-
secuting. The latest exemplification of humility
grown respectable and aggressive was given at
North Shore (Sydney) not long ago, when a
“ capting ” gave one Gallagher, a mere boy, into
custody for demonstrative conduct within the
barracks, and, not content with incarcerating the
offender for 30 hours, pressed for his committal to
Quarter Sessions. Somebody suggested that the
captain’s conduct was unchristian-like ; but that’s
just where he was wrong. It was desperately and
horribly Christian.
The Melbourne Standard reports that
gold is so plentiful at Murchison (W.A.) that the
sheep which graze around there have chunks of it
sticking to their teeth. This looks promising,
but on the Thames (M.L.), in the old days of the
Caledonia mine, things were even better. Sheep
were scarce there, but horses were abundant, and
almost every one of them had a bank deposit
receipt for a large amount in his mouth. The
gold used to accumulate on the animal’s teeth to
such an extent that he had to take it to the bank
to get rid of it before he could eat his breakfast.
One horse got lost there for six months, and when
he was found again he had accumulated a canital
of £4500 which he had fixed for 12 months at 5 per
cent.
A correspondent writes to point out that
Australia badly wants a national song “ similar to
‘Yankee Doodle,’ with a good lively air to it.”
He kindly sends along the song. We quote one
verse as a sample of what the weary newspaper
man has to put up with :
The bold kangaroo he is pumpkins a few
As he springs off his tail, as he springs off his tail;
And the nations he will chase
When he put on the pace
And springs off his tail, and springs off his tail.
A London paper, re Mrs. Besant and her
awful falling-off among the Mahatmas and the
philosophers of the Hidden Way :
Mrs. Besant’s unfortunate relapse should be a warning
to those who would advocate that women, even of the
higher intellectual grade, are fit and proper persons to be
eiitmsted with the management of State affairs. Sup-
pose, for example, that Mrs. Besant had been entrusted
with the post of Home Secretary, and were to advise the
Queen as to the remission or otherwise of sentences
according to instructions received—by the penny post—
from the Thcosophical Mrs. ’Arris’s who are called
Mahatmas.
Also suppose, for example, that Colonel Olcott
had been made Home Secretary, or the deceased
and lamented Joe Smith with his revelations and
Ids “golden book,” or suppose a Mahatma got the
billet, or Milner Stephen with his red flannel and
his healing breath, or say that the wildly erratic
George Francis Train had it —what then ? Do not
all these possibilities show just as clearly that a
man shouldn’t have the job either ? And then, if
a woman isn’t fit to have a hand in State affairs,
and if a man isn’t fit either for precisely the same
rea'On, who is to be Home Secretary? Barring
the Missing Link, there is nothing left.

diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy

“ So you will have nothing to say to me, Aline
“ Nothing.”
“ Think—it is best to be my friend.”
“It is useless, Monsieur Vimard —please leave
me.”
“ Ah, I know your reason. Rene Brujere has
been speaking to you.”
“ Well, and if he has?”
“ Only this —I hate Rene! Come, I will give
you one more chance. Will you hear me?”
But Aline _ had left the cafe before he had
finished. Vimard smiled gently, and ordered
another absinthe.
Vimard and Rene Brujere were both students
at the celebrated medical schools of Paris. The
first was a clever man—absorbed all day in his
studies and lectures, and reputed to have an un-
canny taste for toxology. He was a regular
frequenter of the Cafe Maria, where he used to
sit all the evening drinking absinthe and smiling
sweetly.
. He and Rene Brujere had for some time been
rivals for Aline; she had always been most im-
partial with her smiles, but latterly seemed to
favour Rene. A happy, sunny youth was he, well
liked by his fellows and professors—a man of
brilliant parts—though at present he frequented
one of the fastest sets of the University. A man
of some determination, too—with a weakness for a
pretty face—which is not a paradox.
Vimard said nothing—he was amiable and
affable as ever, and his smile seemed to have
grown sweeter.
In a few weeks the lectures closed and the
steady plodders set to work with a will to study
for the final examination to be held in a short
month’s time. The methodical ones mapped out
their work beforehand—so many hundred pages
of notes per day—-and these were generally the
most successful. Others, fired with a somewhat
tardy zeal, locked themselves in their rooms, and
threw boots and keys out of the window—drew
up provisions with a basket and line—worked
with tremendous energy, and, after a week of black
coffee and wet towels, gave it up in despair, and
returned to the old life of piquet, absinthe, and
“ les demoiselles.”
Rene had disappeared from his old haunts and
could not be found—some said he was at Meudon
—others at Corbeille—his rooms were to let, and
his trunks gone. Strangely enough Aline had
also disappeared—which augured badly for Rene’s
diploma.
Vimard did not change his life one jot—heard
the discussions and rumours at the cafe —listened
with his usual smile and only changed his drink
from absinthe to sugar and water with orange
flowers.
The month passed all too quickly for the
workers, all too slow for the idlers.
The examinations usually lasted ten days or a
fortnight—ten days of suspense, of agony, of
anxious hopes and fears during which the little
world of the Quartier Latin was more agitated
than by a barricade or a revolution in the city.
Then one by one the victims stood up before the
awful bench of professors. One poor fellow
against a host of tormentors, torturing him and
probing him to find his weak points. No wonder
that he should flounder sometimes, and one can
sympathise with the man who, asked to give an
example of expansion of bodies by heat, answered,
“In-summer the days are longer than in winter !”
Rene, who had re-appeared, passed this pre-
liminary ordeal well; indeed, Vimard only sur-
passed him—the finals were at the end of the
week.
The next day the University seemed filled with
a vague stench—undefinable, but present and
loathsome.
Towards the evening it grew stronger—those in
the same hall as Rene seemed to feel it most—
professors, public, and students were annoyed and
disgusted—it had been a warm day they said, and
drains were not perfection even in the Home of
Science. Rene went home with the stench in his
nostrils—it seemed to pervade the whole street—
the very meat and drink were nauseous. When
he awoke next day, at dawn, he felt as if he were
suffocating—his room was reeking with the vile,
detestable smell, and when he threw open his
window it seemed worse. He rushed into the
street—horror! People fled from him on every
side with loathing. God ! It was a horrible,
fearful, noisome stench ! the very horses and
dogs shrank from him, and where he passed they
sprinkled ammonia and disinfectants.
He thought the people must be mad. He felt
ms brain reeling with the over-powering vapours.
He shouted, and ran to speak to some men. They
paused ten paces away—then turned to flee with
their handkerchiefs to their noses. At last the
poor wretch realised that this pestilence, this
hell-stink, came from him—from him alone—it
was he who stank ! It was from his body that the
horrible stench came ! And he sat on the kerb
and groaned and loathed himself.
Pretty soon he heard a window open and felt
the impact of a hard object, whilst a voice cried :
Away, thou pestilence—away, thou leper, thou
walking corpse—go bury thyself again !”
Half-mad, with a nameless dread in his breast
and the stench of ton thousand carrions in his
mouth, he bent his head and fled away, through
streets and boulevards to the green fields and
trees. No one thought of stopping him—the sen-
tinels drew back horrified, and one raised his
me to shoot.
P antin ff> fetching with nausea, he
stumbled and fell in a coppice.
He must have lain some time fainting, for he
was aroused by a sharp nip, and found a hungry
Pig trying his calf—a pig—the only living thing
inat could approach him. Por three days and
iee nights he wandered in the woods, hiding at
day-time lest the keepers should find him, and
mg like some savage beast on roots and berries,
n the fourth day, one of the keepers, on going

his experiences.
Well, the “scent” left him in the same unac-
countable way it came—he obtained leave to pass
again, under his exceptional circumstances, and
passed well—his strange malady was the talk of
the town for a few days till a new sensation came
up.
Yimard? Well, he passed too, and gained a
ward in the Hospital for his able and remarkable
paper “on the effects of tellurium salts on the
human body.”
Aline? Oh —of course she found a consoler
after the first two days of Rene’s absence. No,
not Yimard.
The local doctor in a little town on one of
the rivers of N.S.W. has a wife, and the wife has
about eleven dogs. She is a lady of massive con-
struction, with a carnivorous expression and a
devouring eye, and when her husband starts on
his rounds she accompanies him. So do the dogs.
When the old man—a harmless individual with
an obliterated aspect—goes in to diagnose an
enlarged liver, or to fix a broken leg, she goes
along with him, and the dogs wait outside. She
also hustles round and looks at tumours and
scalds, and offers suggestions, and she discusses
the patient’s condition in an affable, unembarrassed
way that makes that sufferer long to attend her
funeral. Probably she means well, but a nervous
patient doesn’t want to be visited by one doctor,
a woman, and eleven dogs all in one act. It is
too overwhelming.
The solitary constable stationed at Ayton,
near Cooktown, N.Q., recently arrested an alleged
murderer and had him up before the local beaks.
The functionary stepped forward to sign his
depositions ; the prisoner rushed for the open
door. The functionary collared him on the
threshold, and the prisoner rounded on him, and
heaved him across the room. His nose made a
dent in the wall and gore incarnadined the
precincts, but he nobly re-collared the prisoner,
and both rolled over in the shambles, and
wallowed amid the ruins. The officer called upon
the Bench in the Queen’s name, and Dogberry—
two of him—fell upon the struggling heap of
policeman and prisoner, and secured the latter at
the cost of being tattooed all over with kicks and
disfigurements. One Dogberry wrote to the
Colonial Secretary narrating the above incidents
and asking for a second policeman at Ayton. The
Colonial Secretary pithily remarked that “there
appears to be a certain amount of justice ” in
the request. However, the Government has not
yet heard the prisoner’s opinion on the subject.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh

“ The Breaker ” : “ Love Outlasteth All ” in
print. We regret to say that the other two tore them-
selves twice and then rushed into a large basket before
w'e could stop them “J.J.H.” (Dunedin, M.L.); We
don’t care for imitations of the ancient humorist,
Jeremiah “Ignoramus”: The “ maund ” is 25lbs.
Tael (Chinese coin) is supposed to be worth 4s. 10|d., but
varies in different parts of China. The Chinese “kin,”
which we suppose you mean, is 1 jibs. Silver coin varies
in value simply because silver fluctuates violently in
price as tea might, or beef. In England gold—which
keeps very steady in price—is legal tender—in other
words, anybody can always get gold for his silver, and that
keeps the latter firm. But for that the English shilling
would vary between Bd. and 9d. according to the value of
silver, that being about its real worth. In countries where
silver fluctuates it is because gold is not obtainable in
exchange “James F. G.” (Melb.): Consult a good local
man...” Oxide”: Thanks. Glad to hear from you of tener...
“W. Shakespeare, junr.”: Forwarded to address given,
Sorry to say have lost sight of the clippings of which you
made us involuntary bailees ...“Wai Rimmerai ”(Bris-
bane): Too coarse. Besides, the New Testament
is a democratic and socialistic volume, and we never
throw bricks at it, even by implication, or allow any one
else to do it in our columns. The Old Testament is woe-
fully offensive in places, but if a dull race of bigots have
ohosen to hitch on the dirt of that ancient publication to
the new Gospel that isn’t our fault....” A Cliftonite”: Too
long. Musings of that sort takea dreadful lot of space and
are very tearful reading... “ P. W.”(Langlo, D.): To hand ~
“ Ourimbah ”: Too much of the W. T. Stead variety. We
don’t edit this paper with a horrible outrage in one hand
and a hymn in the other,...“ Whaler” (Cobar): Your
vision of nobles and swags received, with thanks...
“ Pakeha ”: The trick of including unsigned notes as cash
in hand has been done, nevertheless. You can’t argue
very well against a fact.... “J.H.C.” : It’s no use hitting
a religion w'hen it’s down. Hit something that’s up...
“Mildura”: The trouble is that more than half of the
co-operative enterprises come to grief tor want of some
one who can manage the financial part of the work,
When there is more education the thing will succeed,
The average individual, when he quits school, gives up
studying everything but football and the like, and what he
actually knows after a few years is precious little. ..
“Shaughraun”: You take “Dipso’s” guyver seriously,
which is the great and only joke in your screed. Yet,
after all, you only prove that you are as really biassed in
favour of the French as “Dipso” was pretendedly pre-
judiced in favour of the Germans ; and that women are
eminently adapted to fill some vocations in life. The
question of underselling labour, which, though a side-
issue and mixed up with other problems, is yet a more
imperious practicality to be dealt with, was not touched
upon by either you or “Dipso.” Anyway, your sermon
is too long and (pardon us !) too heavy for our columns,
....“Boomerang”: Reckoning serviceable iron-plated
vessels—the only ones worth counting nowadays—Britain,
at latest advices, had 76; France, 70 ; Russia, 40 ; Italy,

the strongest in the world ; it is concentrated while
Britain’s is spread all over the earth....“ Sairey ” : This
office—barring the char-lady and the night-watchman
votes unanimously that Dickens is the best of English
novelists, and miles ahead of Thackeray. Still it doesn’t
think much of Tom Pinch....“ Quitaquat ” (On the
Hills): We are busy ; six pages of yearnings and
musings and soulfulness is too large an order ...
“P.L.” (Mansfield): Of local interest only, we fear....
“ H. 8.” (Wentworth); “Price Waning” has written, but
we may as well add that it is hardly the thing to expect,
by asking, very special information, probably collected at
considerable cost. Why not make the search in the
usual way, through a solicitor? If P.W. took upon him-
self to afford information to parties interested in the
rectification of titles, he would have a long row to hoe
“ M.D.” (Taree): Did you get “Price Warning's” letter?
Ross, Foveaux, Geiis, Cuthbertson—here is a quartette of
w’oman-floggers “Rostra”; Thanks, for story. Will
use if possible “ Sir ’Enry”: Tale received, with
thanks “ D. Boraha”: We overlooked the envelope.
Address to Parliament House “Vide et Crcde”
(Thursday Island): Thanks “Surcingle”; “Kelly”
excellent.. “Yarran”; Thanks “Sans Souci ” :
Thanks “ Andys ” (Newcastle) : Joke all squashed to
rags by a mountain of ponderous metre. “Paradise
Lost” style doesn’t suit the case “Anthony M.”(Gld
49u): Will publish when subject comes up prominently,
as it will in a few weeks “ Don Quixote ”; Yes, we pay
for what we print. What was the name of it ? “ P.K.”
(Molong); It is purely a legal question, but we should say
that you would not succeed in attempts to dispossess him.
You’ve heard of adverse possession, haven’t you? .And
besides, the original grant was perfectly valid. It* was
only an alleged ’cute lawyer named Alfred Stephen (who
told Mrs. Bayley, wife of a subaltern in the 50th Regi-
ment, that Nature intended him for an upholsterer) who
declared all such grants invalid, and his opinion was
pretty soon knocked on the head by a validating proclama-
tion. ...“ J.M.P.” (Melb.): We agree with your remarks
re Wales, but then we have said it all before. We want
something new....“ Rappahannock ” : Your theories re
lawyers were simply our own published theories written
out and sent back to us. No man is grateful for the loan
of his own ideas “W. 0.” (Lower Tarcutta): Only a
bad imitation of Bret Harte “E. Evans ” : (1) The full
text of “Frank the Poet’s Tour Through Hell” will be
published with other verses by convict poets and poet-
asters, in an edition annotated by “ Price Waning”—to
subscribers only. (2) As regards the full text of the
“Convict’s Oath,” it is too obscene to publish in full, but
if you communicate direct with “ Price Waning,” care of
Bulletin, he may have no objection to hand you a copy.
... “Oikos”: An elaborate and hopeless scheme. You
say, for instance, that each electorate should return five
members representing respectively agriculture, pasture,
mining, commerce, and trades. How 7 much agriculture,
mining, or pasture wants to be represented in Balmain,
for instance. Besides, you don’t want to represent mines
and grass, but human beings.. “Marmion”: Thanks,

Anarchist being out of town “Cliftonian ” : Yes, cer-
tainly. .. .“Dan ” : Thanks... .“J.D.” (Zeehan): Thanks.
Will read “Medi-Cuss” (Bellingen); Received with

in the fleeting and transitory tip “E.R.C.”: Poems
about drunken females are not altogether in our line
“ D.X.” (Ryde): Nothing new or surprising in it, which is
a fatal objection....“ Fides Achates” (Armidale): Tiik
Bulletin has said it all over and o\er again, and Said it
much more forcibly.... “Sazerac”: The writer you
mention suffers from one incurable complaint—he thinks
that no one in earth or heaven knows anything
but himself. His superciliousness is simply appalling.,..
“ L.S.P.”(Cunnamulla); Sorry we can’t inform you on
the point... “ H.H.”: Thanks for letter “Insurgent
We presume Prince George of Wales is coming out here
in a naval capacity, partly to “cement’’the same old
“ bonds,” and partly because he wants the screw'attached
to the billet “ D.C.” (Coolabah): This thing is getting
stale. The Bulletin backed Parnell right to the last
because his country needed him. A brainy man comes

was successively a Roman province ; an independent
Frankish kingdom : a part of the old Frankish empire ;an
Austrian duchy ; a Polish principality ; and then a French
province once more till 1870 “ L.L.” : It was true, as
mentioned in Toe Bulletin last week, that Dibbs has
been seen a good deal of late in the Ministerial room
along with Parkes’ supporters, and on this fact the theory
of a coming coalition was based. The leading Foreign-
traders took to embracing Dibbs violently in the last days
of the Parkes Ministry, and they used, in a roundabout
way, to ask him to consider their premises as his own
and to drop in and have a good time whenever ho had an
hour to spare. They meant him to consider the place as
his own in his capacity as a member .of a Parkes-
Dibbs coalition, and he came and regarded it as
his own because he intended to fire them all. outrpre-
sently and own the Ministerial room himself ,
“Outsider”: Received with thanks “Andys” (New-
castle): Poem concerning rooster hardly suitable...
“H.J.W.” (Albury): Will look into it carefully. Why
didn’t you enclose newspaper cutting? Paper not to
hand “Frank Fynn”; Too long and not sufficiently
astonishing. A nice, gentlemanly tale with nothing un-
usual in it is a lost quantity in this office.... “ Pelican ”
(Melbourne): “Scratching for his Wife” declined with
thanks. Same remark applies to “God moves iii a
mysterious way.” We explained our feelings over the
latter in a previous issue, but it probably escaped your
gye ...“ A. Johnson ”; We never explain a joke. If a
man can’t understand it he had better give it up....
“J.A.C.”: We have no reason to believe the sweep in
question was drawn anywhere “0.T.L.”: We don’t
really believe there was ever any battle of Trafalgar at

A Frenchman, with a noble eye for artistic
effect, one night recently climbed half-way up the
Eiffel Tower, fixed the end of about 100 yards of
rope round his neck, made the other end fast to
the tower, and then fled through the air and the
darkness till the noose brought him up. He was
found there in the morning, and it was noticed,
when his remains were brought down, that he had
hung himself in correct evening costume. Even
in his last moments he had an eye to the eternal
fitness of things.
The S.M. Herald girds with especial
rancour at Edmund Barton for belonging to a
Ministry which proposes to postpone the “ great
question of Federation ” till next year. The
Herald didn’t mind Parkes postponing it, so long
as events didn’t postpone Parkes. But now the
Herald wants Federation for early breakfast
without fail. The Herald knows heavy legisla-
tion is a physical impossibility this year. The
election-writs are not finally returnable till 28th
November, though the House has been only
adjourned until the 18th. The Herald’s own
calculation is that there can only be nineteen
sittings before Christmas Eve. Yet, with the
estimates to be passed, and with several measures
of absolute necessity to be considered, the
Herald wants Federation jammed through
regardless of impossibilities. The fact is, the
question must be postponed. Under the circum-
stances, even a measure for the burning of the
Herald by a specially uncommon hangman, and
the execution of the editor, though it might be a
Bill of pressing public need, would have to be put
off for a,season.

Rev. Hugh Gihnour, an Adelaide demo-

died on 23rd October, aged 42 years. The orthodox
parson whose life is one generous fattening process

over the hardships and grievances of the poor,
dies old and worn Out in what should have been
his prime.
W. E. Abbott, the capitalist whose tale of
woe has slopped over daily for the last six months
in the correspondence columns of the Australian

fools and knaves”—for. the sake of office. Mr.
Abbott is hereby informed that he is a failure and
a grievous waste of ink. He is only a fly on the

and he isn't a large fly, either—only an ordinary,
middle-sized one.
General Giovamunnelli, a Mexican fire-
eater now in the French service, is the hero of a
gory narrative. In the thick of an engagement
and under a heavy fire he was explaining to his
comrades the details of some difficult military
mameuvre when —
Suddenly the officer on his right whom he was especi-
ally addressing fell dead with a bullet through his brain.
Without apparently noticing the incident, the General
turned to his left-hand neighbour and continued his ex-
planation. A minute later this second officer also
dropped, and Giovanninnelli, still imperturbable, was
turning to a third officer to complete his tactical lecture,
when this one also fell dead with a ball in his chest,
“ Whether the General ever completed his remarks,”
observes the officer who relates the anecdote, “ I cannot
say. All I know is that I did not, remain to listen any
longer.”
“ At a crisis like this,” said the Man with
the Piercing Orbs, “at the parting of thejways,”
as the. philosopher puts it, at the climax of con-
vulsion when even Parkes’ Hair cannot escape
the deadly clutch of the influenza, and when
Dibbs and Edmund Barton toss up for first cavort
in the coming Carmagnole, let the purblind mole
of the momentary now swear by his unchristened
(because unborn) fetiches and yell cacophonously
for free-trade or fritteration, as the case
may be ; let the mugmump lie stertorously
in his golgotha, pawing over the desic-
cated relics of his vanished victims; let the
geebung scintillate vainly out of his own embers ;
let earth howl for soup, and ocean mourn for dry-
hash ; but let me, as a calm, rational, and level-
beaded cornstalk, whoop with all my lungs for
that motherly oil of commerce known as John
Robertson’s whisky, or, more lovingly and
familiarly, as ‘ J.D.R.’—Johnny, the flower of
Dundee.

The Land of the Crocodile.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I hero is probably nothing which more
effectually induces tlie true citizen of this great
country to feel round for a tomahawk or an iron-
bark nulla than reading an account of a meeting
of “ representative Australians ”in London. The
infatuated mortal who made a fortune by acci-
dent in a rich reef, or held a tract of squatting
country as big as a European kinerdom under a
£lO license away back in the forties or fifties, still
cherishes a hazy delusion that lie represents Aus-
tralia and Australians in some way or other not
clearly defined, though his habits and thoughts
are about as much in accord with the Australian’s
as those of a clay-eating Indian or a blubber-
devouring Esquimo.
* * #
Prominent among these misguided fossil
relics of our early barbarous days, are some of the
“ °W squatters ” who wont “ home ” 30 or 40 years
ago to grow fat and useless on Australian money
while they gossip about the good old days and
continue to advise the Imperial Government how
Australia of the present should bo governed.
* * *
And this reminds me that when compiling
my coming history of the Darling Downs and the
6ciily sc]ujittors, there c.\me into my possession a
copy of a letter sent by Christopher Rolleslon,
the first Crown Lands Commissioner on the
Downs, to Arthur Hodgson, the present Sir
Arthur, one of our “representative colonists”
A his letter is dated on April !), 1845, from Cam-
booya, the then Border police-station.
therein informs Hodgson that lie has accepted 'his
tender for supplying rations to the Border police
at Is. per day, and forage at Gd. per ration of 41b.
of corn daily. Hodgson’s sureties, guaranteeing
that he would carryout his contract, were Dom-
viHe, Taylor, and David Forbes.
* * *
Hodgson was always in trouble with his
men, w.,0 were nearly all assigned convicts. He
was one of the most regular prosecutors at the
C.uubooya Police-court. The working free then
ami ex-convicts had a hard time in those days.
The, first had their wages forfeited and the others
got the lash. On the 17th Dec., 1844, a ticket-of-
leave man named Jas. Cannon, ex ship John, in
18311, was brought up at the Cambooya Police
Court, before Christopher Rolleston, David Forbes
and Arthur Hodgson, charged by Mark Halo, the
chief constable and overseer, with insolence and
disobedience of orders. There was no other
evidence. The offence would be punished to-day
by a fine of ss. The following is the verdict
“The Court sentence the prisoner to a hundred
lashes—7s on the back and 25 on the breech.” I
attach an exact copy of all three magistrates’
signatures, and that of Hale, signed on the verdict
in the original deposition-book, which is in my
possession, along with still more interesting manu-
scripts of the early days.

One of Burke and Wills’ camels came in
af ter ward s f rom Cooper’s Creek to Wyenbah stati on.
A mile from the homestead a blackfellow was
herding a mob of cattle. He was lying down
half asleep holding the bridle of his horse. A wild
rush among the cattle and a frenzied snort from
his steed suddenly brought the myall to an erect
position. The first sight he beheld was the camel
standmg; about five yards away gazing at him
with a mournful but amiable expression, which, in
plain language meant “dear mother, I’ve come
home to die.” The myall only gave one glance at
that awfijl and previously unheard-of apparition,
seen only in dreams begotten of a late supper of
roast bear, and then he struck out for the home-
stead, first flinging away his bridle under the im-
pression that his horse wouldn’t travel fast enough
for the occasion. Every 50 yards he looked round,
only to see the camel trotting peacefully along in
the rear, a close second, and then on each occasion
there was a louder yell and an increase in
the pace. When the myall reached the house he
dived through the window, carrying away the
glass and half the sash, and crawled under the
dining-room table, whence he took a scared peep
to see if the devil hadn’t followed him through
the keyhole. And then Mrs. Eazey, who chanced
to be at home, enquired what was the matter, and
eventually Billy came slowly and cautiously from
under the table to explain that out at the front
door there was something half horse and half
emu, but that nothing like it had ever been seen
before in Billy’s country. Billy never recovered
from the shock.

The Rev. J. G. Gribble, the originator of
the Warafigesda Mission in N.S.W., is at present
in Queensland on the look-out for a suitable site
for a mission-station among the blacks in the
Cairns district. Gribble is a thin, dark, sombre-
looking man whose gaunt framework offers no
temptation to even the most rabid cannibal,
except those specially addicted to eating bones.
He tells a good story of an incident on a journey
from Albnry to Sydney. The mail-train was
passing across some unoccupied country where
station accommodation was represented by a soli-
tary platform, where any lonely bushman anxious
to extricate himself from the surrounding soli-
tude could stop an ordinary train by wildly
waving a red tin-banner and executing a
war-dance. As the mail-train approached
this exciting locality a woman was observed
brandishing the tin ensign and making frantic
gesticulations to the driver to stop. The driver
and guard being under the impression that several
budges were down, or a mile of line was uprooted
by an earthquake, or a mountain had fallen over
the track, brought the tram to a standstill about
a hundred yards past the platform. Then the
excited lady, who had a red head and wore blucher
boots, rushed by the astonished guard and going
a grey-headed old fossil who was yelling
Hole, Martha ! from th© window, hand©d him
a live rooster and a bunch of flowers and fled ! The
rage of the guard and the driver, and the language
they employed to express their emotions, must be
left to those who have fraternised with the pioneer
bullock-drivers of the old days.

“Victor Second.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We were training two horses for the
Buckatowndown races. An old grey warrior
called Tricolor, whom the station boys insisted on
calling “The Trickier,” and a mare for .the hack
race, fetation horses don’t get trained quite like
Carbine : some days we had no time to give them
their gallops at all, so they had to gallop twice as
far the next day to make up. And one day the
boy we had looking after The Trickier fell in witli
a mob of sharps who told him we didn’t know
anything about training horses, and that what the
horse really wanted was “a twicer,” that is to
say, a gallop twice round the course, feo the boy
gave him “a twicer” on his own responsibility,
and when we found out about it wo gave the boy a
twicer with the strap, and he left and took out a
summons against us for assault. But somehow or
another we managed to get the old horse pretty
fit, and trying him against hacks of different
descriptions we persuaded ourselves that we had
the biggest certainty ever known on a race-course.
* * *
When the horses were galloping in the
morning the kangaroo-dog Victor used nearly
always go down to the course and run round with
them. It amused him apparently and didn’t hurt
anyone, so we used to let him race; in fact, we
rather encouraged him because it kept him in good
trim to hunt kangaroos. When we were starting
the horses away for the meeting someone said- we
had better tie up the dog or he would be getting
stolen at the races. We called and whistled but
he had made himself scarce, and we started off
and forgot all about him.
* * #
Buckatowndown Races. Red - hot day,
everything dusty, everybody drunk and blasphem-
ous. All the betting at Buckatowndown was
double-event. You had to win the money first,
and fight the man for it afterwards. The start
for our race, the Town Plate, was delayed for a
quarter of an hour, because the starter flatly
refused to leave a fight of which lie was an
interested spectator. Every horse, as he did his
preliminary gallop, had a string of dogs after him,
and the clerk of the course came full cry after the
dogs with a whip. By and by the horses strung
across to the start at the far side of the course.
They fiddled about for a bit, and then down went
the flag and they came sweeping along all bunched
up together, one moke holding a nice position on
the inside. All of a sudden we heard a wild
chorus of imprecations—“ Look at that dog!”
Our dog had made his appearance and had chipped
in with the racehorses and was running right in
front of the field. It looked a guinea to a
gooseberry that some of them would fall on him.
The owners danced and swore in awful style!
What did we mean by bringing a something
mongrel there to trip up and kill horses that were
worth a paddockfull of all the horses we had ever
owned, or ever would breed or own, even if wo
lived to be a thousand ? We were fairly in it and
no mistake. As the field came past the stand the
first time we could hear the riders swearing at the
dog, and a wild yell of execration arose from the
public. Ho had got right among the ruck by this
time, and was racing alongside his friend The
Trickier, thoroughly enjoying himself. After
passing the stand the pace became very merry
and the dog stretched out all ho knew, and when
they began to make it too hot for him he cut off
corners, and joined at odd intervals, and every
time he made a fresh appearance the people in the
stand lifted up their voices and “ swore cruel ”as
the boys phrased it. The horses were all at the
whip as they turned into the straight, and then
old tricolor and the publican’s mare singled out.
Wo could hear the “ chop, c]iop ! ” of the whips as
they came along together, but the mare could
suffer it as long as the old fellow could, and she
swerved off and he struggled home a winner by a
length or so. Just as they settled down to finish
the dog dashed up on the inside, and passed the
post at old Tricolor’s girths. The populace im-
mediately took to him with stones, bottles, and
other missiles, and he had to scratch gravel to
save his life. What was the amazement then of
the other owners to learn that the judge had
placed Tricolor first, Victor second, and the
publican’s mare third ?
* # #
The publican tried to argue it out with
him. He said you couldn’t place a kangaroo-dog
second in a horserace. The judge said that it
was his (hiccough) business what he placed, and
that those who (hiccough) interfered with him
would be sorry for it. Also he expressed the
opinion, garnished with a fusilade of curses and
hiccoughs, that the publican’s mare was no rotten
good, and that she was the right sort of mare for
a poor man to own, because she would keep him
poor. 1 hen the publican called the judge a cow,
and the judge being willing, a rip, tear, and chew
fight ensued, which lasted some time and the
judge won. There were 15 protests lodged against
our win, but we didn’t have any fear of these
going against us—we had laid the stewards a bit
.We got away with our horses at once
didn t w r ait for the hack race. Every second
man we met wanted to run us a mile for £lOO
aside, and there was a drunken shearer who was
spoiling for a fight, and he said he had heard we
were brimming over with science.” and he
had ridden forty miles to find whether it was a
fact or not. We folded our tents Tike the Arab
and stole away and left the point unsettled. But
i remains on the annals of Buckatowndown how a
kangaroo-dog ran second for the Town Plate.

The Digger’s Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scrape the bottom of the hole, gather up the stuff,
Fossick in the crannies, lest you leave a grain
behind,
Just another shovelful and that’ll be enough,
Now we’ll take it to the bank and see what wo
can find,
Give the dish a twirl around,
Let the water swirl around.
Gently let it circulate, there’s music in the swish,
And the twinkle of the gravel,
As the pebbles quickly travel
Around in merry circles on the bottom of the dish.
Ah, if man could wash his life, if he only could,
Panning off the evil deeds, keeping but the
good.
What a mighty lot of digger’s dishes would be
sold,
Tho’ I fear the lot of tailings would be greater
than the gold,
Give the dish a twirl around,
Let the water swirl around,
Man’s the sport of circumstance however he may
wish,
Fortune, are you there now ?
Answer to ray prayer now,
And drop a. half-ounce nugget in the bottom of
the dish.
Gently let the water lap, keep the corners dry,
That’s about the place thegold’ll generally stay,
What vvas that bright particle that just then
caught my eye ?
I fear me by the look of things ’twas only
yellow clay,
Just another twirl around,
Let the water swiil around,
That’s the way wo rob the river of its golden fish,
What’s that ? can’t we snare a one?
Don’t say that there’s ne’er a one,
Bah, there’s not a colour in the bottom of the
dish.
"SURCINGLE."
George Augustus Sala the other day
privately related that while waiting in the office
of a Yankee “Palace” hotel, where he intended
putting up, and watching the clerk entering his
pedigree, brands,- &c., he noticed some dark
objects moving across the ledger. Becoming sus-
picious, he asked, “What are those?” “Bugs,”
laconically replied the ledgerman. “ What are
they doing there?” “Guess they’re waiting to
see the number of your room !”
Mr. Newman, N.S. W. Frectrade politician,
has made of himself a finished and complete
public ass, and his ears stand up in bold relief
against the sky. He wanted a park for his con-
stituents at East Orange, and therefore he seems
to have requested his friends there to write a
letter abusing him, and threatening to throw him
out if he didn’t get it. Then he went to the
Minister of Lands and showed him the document,
and tearfully told him that when his constituents
had started to heave language like this, things
were desperate, and he must either get the park
or else join Dibbs and become a Protectionist.
Then he wrote to his constituents with a whoop of
joy, telling them that the thing had come off.
Lastly, some base miscreant got hold of the whole
story and published it. Finally, as already men-
tioned, Newman became an ass.
Speaking of the pious frenzy which has
arisen in Victoria the S.M. Herald wisely
observes: —
The fact that our friends in Victoria have been some"
times regarded as devotees to the varied mysteries of the
worship of Mammon is nothing at all against the pos-
sibility of their going in earnestly on this new line; for,
paradoxical though it may look, these two divergent and
dissimilar tendencies are not infrequently found together
in human nature.
True, O bulky and moral paper ! Salvation and
the accumulation of cash do go together, and
when the average sinner is “saved ” his cat gets
no fatter and his dog doesn’t get a square feed
any oftener, and his employes don’t got their
wages raised, and his miserable horse is galloped
off its four legs just as before. Therefore when
we meet an alleged Christian we always go round
to his back premises and ask his horse if he is
genuine, and if that animal reports unfavourably
upon him we accept its verdict as conclusive.
Two thousand six hundred per shent was
all a bashful Brisbane man, one Cohen, could
find it in his heart to ask from another pork-
avoider, for a nineteen-day loan of £250. When
time was called, the lender put the bailiffs on the
borrower, and the borrower put a head on the
lender in return. Then Papa Pinnock, P.M.,
listened to their tale of woe, and the Israelites
went up into the temple to pray, for it was the
festival of the “Ten Days of Atonement,” that
ushers in the Jewish year 5652. How they do
love each other!
When Israel of the Lord beloved
Prom onj the land of bandage went,
Emblazoned on their banners flew
This motto, “ shent per shent.”
The vanguard bore three brazen bails,
Aloft on poles, to represent
The Hebrew fiscal policy
And motto “ shent per shent.”
By night they snored the old refrain,
And flapped the fly and shook the lent;
By day they sang their song of praise
And chorussed “shent per shent.”
For forty years behind.their “ cofiks ”
They tramped and mused on shekels lent
To “shentellmen ” in Gentile lands
And copped their “ shent per shent.”
The cloudy guide was all my eye,
The fiery column only meant
To indicate a Promised Land
Of balmy “ shent per shent.”
A Promised Land of noses straight •
To feed the push with noses bent,
And cry, “ What price a little loan V”
“Veil, only ‘ shent per shent ’!”
A Promised Land of addled heads
To haunt the signs of “ money lent, '
Who pawn their souls to heaven or hell
At any price “per shent.”

A Sydney Salvationist convert lately said :
—“ I would have killed a man in a bar brawl,
but when I struck him on the head with a crow-
bar the Lord restrained the force of my arm, so I
only stunned him.” Now, the Deity did not
interfere, for most likely the Deity superintended
the formation of the man’s skull, and when it was
finished the Deity rested, remarking that it was a
lovely nut, dense as an anvil, and that nothing
less than a steam-hammer would crack it.
“There are three codes of morals — one
for women, one for men, and one for Royalty.
Women must be virtuous or be socially damned ;
men may do as they please, provided they pay
their club-bills and do not cheat at cards; Royalty
—well, there’s a divinity doth hedge a royal
person which makes of his orgies very proper tea-
parties. The one sympathetic link in these
several codes is that nobody—not even a woman —
loses caste unless found out.” —Amek.
THEY ROLLED ON THE FLOOR.
On Monday, November 24tb, 1890, the American
papers published the following news item : —
“Mrs. Sarah S. Hensler, of No. 873, East One
Hundred-and-Thirty-fourth-street, New York,
shot and* killed herself yesterday morning. She
was a lady of excellent character and high social
position, and a member of the Rev. Dr. Ramsay’s
Presbyterian Church. She was well-to-do and
very active in various public and private charities.
Since last July she had suffered fearfully from
indigestion and dyspepsia, which brought on
melancholia, and then a kind of insanity, under
the influence of which she took her own life.”
Here is another story, not so tragical, but with
the same moral. The narrator tells it of himself.
“Mostly,” he says, “we dread and fear death,
yet once I prayed to die, and the reason was in
this wise. Up to Christmas, 1888, I had been a
healthy man, but at that time (a period of rejoicing
with so many) I felt depressed, languid, and tired.
My appetite left me, and I was much distressed
after eating the lightest food. My skin and eyes
became tinged with a dark yellow colour, and the
kidney secretion was like blood. The pain in my
stomach was almost unbearable and often lasted
from 12 to 14 hours without intermission. Some-
times I was in pain night and day, and was so bad
that my wife had to sit up with me through the
night. I was constantly sick, and troubled with
a stomach cough, and expectorated a quantity of
green phlegm. f
“ In spite of warm clothing and every comfort,
I was always chilled ; the cold shivers running
through me as if my blood were thin and poor. I
could take uo solid food ; I lived on soups, milk,
puddings, &c., and after each meal I had empty,
gnawing, windy pains at the stomach, wliich
nothing relieved.
“ After a time an intolerable itching of the skin
spread all over me, as if my blood were poisoned.
Our family physician attended mo for about a
year. Acting upon his advice I went to Harro-
gate, where I consulted another doctor, and drank
the Waters, but feeling worse 1 returned home.
The bath attendant at Harrogate and others told
me I was suffering from blood poisoning, but this
the doctors never mentioned. The first doctor
said it was the passing of gallstones that gave me
such dreadful pain.
“ I now consulted an eminent specialist at Man-
chester, who confirmed what the other doctor had
told mo, but none of them afforded me any relief.
“In this miserable way I dragged on for six
months more, and became so much reduced I
could scarcqjy put one foot before the other, and
so thin thatJ/iC rings fell off my fingers and rolled
on the floor. I was in such pain that I prayed to
die, and one of the doctors told a friend of mine I
could not recover.
“ In August qf last year (1890), whilst my suffer-
ings were at the worst, a book was sent to me by
post, telling of a medicine called Mother Sejgel's
Curative Syrup. I determined to try it, and sent
to Mr. Evans, Chemist, Lymm, for a supply.
After taking the first bottle, I felt a little better,
and by persevering with the remedy I recovered
my appetite, and gradually gained strength. My
natural colour is now returned, and I feel as well
as I ever did in my life ; in fact, as well as I did
when a boy. I can eat any kind of food without
inconvenience, and Jrtive gained 30 pounds in
weight during the past three months. I may add
that previous to taking this medicine 1 was so
much altered that my friends, and even my pupils,
scarcely recognised me. I tell every one what
Seigel’s Syrup did for me. ”
The gentleman who makes the foregoing state-
ment is a person of position and known to all the
people of Lymm. He declines to permit the publi-
cation of his name, but the perfect truth of what
is here related is vouched for by Mr. J.'H. Evans,
the chemist above named.
The case was an aggravated one of indigestion
and dyspepsia and its natural consequence. The
whole system had been poisoned and disordered by
the acids engendered by the fermentation in the
stomach, and, had not Seigel’s Syrup come to the.
rescue just as it did a fatal result must have
followed in a brief time.

The Literary Friend.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Once I wrote a little poem which I thought was
very fine,
And I showed the printer’s copy to a critic friend
of mine,
1 irst he praised the thing a little, then he found a
little fault;
“The ideas are good,” he muttered, “but the
rhythm seems to halt.”
So I straighten’d up the rhythm where he marked
it with his pen,
And I copied it and showed it to my clever friend
again.
“You’ve improved the metre greatly, but the
rhymes are bad,” he, said,
As he read it slowly, scratching surplus wisdom
from his head.
So I worked as he suggested (I believe in taking
time),
And I burnt the “midnight taper” while I
straightened up the rhyme.
“It is better now,” he muttered, “you go on and
you’ll succeed,
It has got a ring about it—the ideas are what you
need. ”
So I worked for hours upon it (I go on when I
commence),
And I kept in view the rhythm and the jingle and
the sense,
And I copied it and took it to my solemn friend
once more,
But it ’minded him of something he had some-
where read before.
Now the people say I’d never pub such horrors into
print
If I wasn’t too conceited to accept a friendly hint,
And my dearest friends are certain that I’d profit
in the end
If I’d always show my copy to a literary friend.
Sydney, Oct., ’9l.
HENRY LAWSON.
Gertrude Atherton says that people in-
capable of caring for themselves and crippled
children should have their heads stuck in a barrel
of chloroform, out of pure Christian charity.
Melbourne Evening Standard, during
two and a-half years, was served with 50 writs of
libel, of which only two ever came into court,
and those two were breakdowns, without the
defence being troubled to reply. The ex.’s of the
threatening* totalled over £400, of which not a
penny is recoverable, because the pretended prose-
cutors were all men of straw, not jmssessed of the
spare price of a shave.
One Knitt, a temperance lecturer, has
been lulling forth at Napier (M.L.) on the
subject of drink, and how it undermines the con-
stitution, and ruins the nerves, and makes the
nose of the drinker huge and red and horrible.
Therefore, Gorman, the leading publican, an-
nounces in the local paper that he will run Knitt
100 yards for a reasonable wager, in order to show
that drink doesn’t undermine the constitution so
much as teetotalism ; or he will swim Knitt half-
a-inile, or row him five miles, or drive a four-in
hand against him, or, failing all these things, he
will ride a steeplechase with Knitt. Further, he
is willing to bet £50 that lie is a better teetotaller
than Knitt; and, in addition to all these things,
he offers to submit Jus-nose to the inspection
12 respectable citizens if Knitt will Produce his
nose also, and he guarantees that Kttitt’s nhse is
the redder and the more swollen' and disgusting
proboscis of the two, and the sort of thing that no
pure and innocent girl ought to look at. Last of
all, and apart from the nose, ho bets that Knitt
looks more like a bloated drunkard than he does—
that he is shakier, flabbier, more pimpled, and
more unwholesome generally; and he asks that
this question should also be submitted to the jury.
Up to date Knitt hasn’t answered. *
Dear Bulletin,— “ Clothes make the man
the want of.them the fellow.” How often do we
see this illustrated in our towns, when a dead-
broke but well-dressed man sails along beautifully,
while he in moles, who pays his way, is cold-
shouldered ! Anyone who doubt's that clothes
make the man, should travel the bakOlox Well-
dressed, and his doubts will soon disappear.
Many years ago I travelled by coach from Terowie
(b. A.) to the Barrier, attired in artistic corkscrew,
and on the road parted with a small fortune for
meals. Aboard that coach were several “bushies ”
who generally got a. feed for nothing. I had ’a
portmanteau, they had swags. I didn’t realise
the difference just then, but after working for a
tew months as a miner I did. A couple of our
contracting party took a trip to Furnamoota
attired m miner’s rig-out. Walking into the only

ot the pub.-keeper) pointed to a room where
the two could dine, and a little black girl
was told off to attend on them. When the
meal (a good square one) was completed, the
travellers walked into the bar. “What’s the
damage, miss ?” A prolonged look at the inquirer
and then the reply: “Gentlemen, half-a-crown ;

An American gentleman has just con-
fessed that he and six other miners murdered a
party of 24 Chinese in Oregon four years ago and
robbed them of 60,000 dol. in gold dust. Aus-

been legally found out, but he is in business all
the same, and many a Chow has lost the number
of his mess and his bag of stuff per medium of

A vigorous correspondent in the North
sends us a, series of, biographical sketches about
the principal politicians, Judges, and other public
men of Queensland. Looking over them
casually we find that one of the leading
members of the Upper House is an escaped
murderer who entered the ' country on
a stolen horse and carrying a-set of stolen
branding-irons. Another prominent member was
ehucker-oiit in an opium-den in l8f)G, and now
owns a lot of property, all of which is let to
Chinamen; and a friend of his /was wanted
by the years ago for a brutal outrage
but succeeded in squaring the case. A local judge
is said to run a harem, and pay the expenses
chiefly by taking cash insults ffofii wealthy
offenders, and a well-known M.L. A is accused of
having made his first rise by shooting diggers in
the Far North and plundering their mangled
remains. . The remainder of the two Houses con-

started life by coining had money and stealing

What folly it would bo to cut grass with a pair of scissors! Yet peo-
ple do equally silly things every day. Modern progress has grown up
from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn
mower. So don’t use scissors!
But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
ago as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps.
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap
in the toilet, another in the tub, one soap in the stables, and SAPOLIO
lor all scouring and house-cleaning.

Right and wrong are not fixed terms.
What was wrong 50 years ago is right and proper
to-day, and vice versa. Public opinion continually
readjusts her standards of comparison.
“The French nobility of a hundred years
ago,” remarked Carlyle, “said they could afford
to laugh at theories. Then came a man who wrote
a book called ‘The Social Contract.’ The man
was called Jean Jacques Rousseau, and his book
was a theory, and nothing but a theory. The
nobles could laugh at his theory, but their skins
went to bind the second edition of his book,”
W. C. Ranson, an old Herberton (N.Q.)
miner, now in Mashonaland, Africa, writes to the
Wild River Times from the Hartley Hills, 120
miles south of the Zambesi River : —“ Advise the
mining community not to come to this country.
The gold is not worth it, and the fever is a perfect
terror.” He also gives local prices current as
being :—Flour, 2s. 6d, per lb.; sugar, 5s. per lb. ;
tea, 10s. per lb. ; boots, 32s. a-pair; donkeys, £15
each ; horses, from £80 to £95 each. The rivers
are infested with crocodiles and hippopotami ;
the country abounds in lions, wolves, buffaloes,
wild pigs, ostriches, &c.
Kate Elizabeth Day, summoned in London
for neglecting her three little girls, the eldest
5 years and 10 months old, deposed that she had
been deserted by her husband and had since got
her living as a paper-bag maker. “ I am paid 4|d.
per 1000 for it, and have to find my own paste.”
She had had no work for a fortnight. The prose-
cuting officer asked the woman if she would give
up the children to his society. “No,” she replied,
“I love my children.” The magistrate advised
her to do her best, and decided to adjourn the
case for a month. The defendant took her chil-
dren and went away from the court crying, “ to do
her best!”
Pat. Perkins, the Queensland Jonah, and
the pig-headed opponent of Labour in the Queens-
land Parliament, is the son of a Tipperary
labourer. Pat. made his money out of the Vic-
torian mines, baffled the efforts of a few sea-cap-
tains to wreck him, took to brewing, made his
way into the Assembly on a flood of beer, and got
the post of Minister for Lands from MTlwraith.
At a general election some years back Pat. got
more votes than the number on the roll of his con-
stituency. He now hob-nobs with the Guv’nah.
Much money, many friends. If there is a
man who realises this it is Morris Collmann, of
Bendigo, one time a proprietor of the well-known
Collmann and Tacchi Mine, near Eaglehawk.
Then Morris could writ& his cheque for close on
six figures and have it honoured, too. He was
affectionately regarded by the miners, for was it
not he who said that men should, in his mine,
work no more than eight hours underground ? Ho
left for Germany years ago, and with a partner
entered into corn-speculation, after prudently
banking £10,000 in his own behalf “ against a
rainy day.” The firm’s speculations proved
disastrous ; every cent embarked in the business
was lost, and Morris discovered that his partner’s
actions had rendered him liable also for the
£10,000 ; so once more ho returned to Australia in
the hopes of retrieving his fortunes. On his
return his wealthy friends knew him not; but his
poorer ones, the miners, have not forgotten him.
There is a small stipend attached to the Mining
Board membership, and the miners, grateful for
Colhnann’s actions in the past, always return him
at the head of the poll. He is old now, and not
capable of the work he once could do.
Bathurst (N.S.W.) Advocate rises to
poetic yearnings on the subject of the small
infants who planted trees on Arbor Day, and
soars on the wings of the morning over the bright
land of song. This is the hunk ; —
And the best wish we can publish for the benefit of that
generation is that they may grow up from saplings to be
sturdy, upright men and women, with hearts brave as
oaks, ideas lofty as pines, minds fragrant as cedars, and
virtues manifold as the leaves through which CEolus
breathes his melodies. May their lives be as pure as the
lily, noble as the rose, sweet as the violet, lovable as the
forget-me-not, and yet humble as the daisy—the poets’
flower—the emblem of simplicity.
Also, may they be as enduring as the kitchen-
stove, and strong like the butter in our hash-
tower, and vigorous like Parkes’ I.O.U.’s, and
as swift as Dan. O’Connor rushing to welcome an
eminent visitor or to get out of the road of a dead
failure, or as the wild inroad of the Australian
gentry surging into the refreshment-room at
Gov’ment ’Ouse. The Advocate likewise con-
siders that a Minister of Education is no good
unless he possesses the “ rare exotic of ideality.’
This commendable vegetable has been neglected
a good deal, but now that attention has been
drawn to it, we trust steps will be taken to make
the herb whiz without delay.
The eminent Scottish J udge, Lord Presi-
dent luglis, whoso death was recently cabled,
defended Madeleine Smith, accused of murdering
by poison her lover, Emile L’Angelier, a genera-
tion ago. The prosecution, it may be remem-
bered, depended entirely on circumstantial evi-
dence, and it was to the danger of depending ex-
clusively upon testimony of that nature that lie
addressed himself in his peroration—which, re-
garded by competent critics as the most impres-
sive ever delivered in a British Court, secured the
acquittal of the accused. Inglis said :
I fear that this is no solitary case. The recollection or
the reading of any of us may recall occasions
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o’er her doom.
To rely upon your reason only is nothing less than im-
piously to refuse to call to your aid, in the performance
of a momentous duty, the noblest gifts that God has im-
planted in your breasts'. To determine guilt or
innocence by the light of intellect alone is the exclusive
prerogative of infallibility, and when man’s presumptuous
arrogance tempts him to usurp the attribute of Om-
niscience, he only exposes the weakness and frailty of bis
nature. Then, indeed,
Man, proud man
1 tressed in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant,of what he’s most assured,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high Heaven
As make the angels weep.
During her trial Madeleine Smith had seventeen
offers of marriage. She accepted the wealthiest
fool after it. We have always thought Mrs.
Maybrick took a cue from the sweet—and lucky -
Madeleine. By the way, Inglis’ defence showed
him to be an all-round man. During the trial
Madeleine sat in the dock. “ The girl has a nice
foot and ankle, he said t6 the attorney, “tell her
not to conceal them from the jury.”

telephoned to Adelaide for permission to put out
the fire. When he returned the house was burned
down.

Bishop Butt (R.C.), of England, has been
praying for fine weather that the English harvest
may be saved. Bishop Butt (who seeks, for tin-
pot human purposes, to interfere with arrange-
ments made at the beginning of all time) might
just as well stand in a big butcher’s basket and
pray to the Lord to send him strength enough to
lift himself by the handle.
Dear Bulletin,— Sir Alfred Stephen’s
first contribution to the Australian press was over
the nom-de-plume of “Common Sense,” and ap-
peared in the Hobart Town Gazette of 1824.
His latest contribution was the skilful bit of
special pleading which was published (in “ leaded”
type) by the S.M. Herald on 24th Sept, over the
signature of “Nostri Juris.” Every newspaper
article penned by Sir Alfred can be identified by
style, apart from any other datum of “internal
evidence,” which always sticks out a furlong from
his contributions. Curiously enough, the “Com-
mon Sense ” article was suggested by a question
of jurisdiction and the necessity of bolstering up
the judicial powers that were. So was the “Nostri
Juris” screed, and the motto which headed the
former : “I know my Q. without a prompter ”
might, with equal appropriateness, have intro-
duced the latter.— Price Warung.

In the Transvaal, the members of either
House receive £3 per diem while the Houses are
in session. The President gets a salary of £8o(lU
a year. He lives very quietly—never entertains;
indeed, he never gives a bite or sup to a soul.
He is reported to have amassed a large fortune.
N.S.W. Orangemen are .about to receive a

J. O. Wascoe, who kept the little inn on
Lapstouo HH1 long ere the railway crossed the
N.S.W. Blue Mountains, is dead. When the
iron horse got up the Zig-zag “ Wascoe was the
iirst station opened, but the name has been since
changed to “ Blaxland ’’-after the old-time
explorer. Wascoe was 73 years of age and a
nephew of the distinguished Indian General, bir
James Outran).
Bishop Tucker, of Maoriland, reportsthat
in Uganda (Africa) a man will readily do three
mouths’ work for a Testament. Now any, man
might say he would do three months work for a
Testament, but no one could know that he would
really do it save by actual experiment. Evi.
dently. therefore, some gospel-grinder does try
the experiment, and The Bulletin hereby
records its conviction that the expounder who
would thus trade on the ignorance of the sweated
heathen is a loathsome swindler, a base sneak-
thief, and the worst variety of mercenary
hypocrite. Strangely enough, Bishop Tucker
doesn’t seem to have denounced the low-grade
pirate who thus got three months’ work out of the
illiterate African by scaring him with stories
about Gehenna, and what gaol he is now in for
false pretences wasn’t even mentioned.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
At the depths with the animate world throbbing
o’er you in life and decay—
In the wry wrought cells where the curled dank
mists round the weak lights play —
You are hid from the rays of the sun through
aeons and aeons untold,
Ah, see what the ages have d.ne, with the force
that is new and is old !
That infinite force rebuilds, destroys—remcdels
anew,
In the light of the stars it fulfills ; in the darkness
invaded by you.
Down ’mid the works of time,
That the ages built sublime —
Built in the light of the past,
With the sun raying down to their deeps,
Base upon base in the vast
Sphered mould of the planet’s cast,
In the heart of the great earth sleeps !
Where the sunlight hath lived and ended, full
glad iii its passionate day,
The light of the toiler is blended one moment, O
Earth, in thine aye ;
For what are the days or the years when the
kindled small flame shall be dead ?
And the steel-hurling arm that appears with its
fire that empowers shall be shed.
But for you, O toiler, who pierce the great living
breast of the earth,
There is time to bo sad in the fierce beast-moil
that is thine from thy birth !
Down ’mid the works of time,
That the ages built sublime —
Built in the light of the past.
With the sun raying down to their deeps,
Base upon base in the vast
Sphered mffuld of the planet’s cast,
In the heart of the great earth sleeps !
