DESTINY.
We are what we imagine, and our deeds
Are born of dreaming. Europe acts to-day
Epics that little children in their play
Conjured, and statesmen murmured in their
creeds;
In barrack, court and school were sown those
seeds,
Like Dragon’s teeth, which ripen to affray
Their sowers. Dreams of slaughter rise to
slay,
And fate itself is stuff that fancy breeds.
Mock, then, no more at dreaming, lest our
own
Create for us a like reality!
Let not imagination’s soil be sown
With armed men, but justice, so that we
May for a world of tyranny atone
And dream from that despair — democracy.
DOUBT.
Bo thin, so frail the opalescent ice
Where yesterday, in lordly pageant, rose
The monumental nations —the repose
Of continents at peace! Realities
Solid as earth they seemed; yet in a trice
Their bastions crumbled in the surging floes
Of unconceivable, inhuman woes,
Gulfed in a mad, unmeaning sacrifice.
We, who survive that world-quake, quail
and start,
Searching our hidden souls ivith dark sur-
mise :
So thin, so frail —is reason? Patient art —
Is it all a mockery, and love-all lies?
Who sees the lurking Hun in childhood’s
eyes?
Is Hell so near to every human heartf
Fiction
Elizabeth is pleasantly remembered in her
German Garden, married to a dear German
husband, whom she loved and gently laughed
at. Here she is again, as The Pastor’s Wife
(Bell, per W. Dymock, Sydney), this time
married to another German, and settled in a
desolate little village in East Prussia. The
story, is the tragedy of being a bishop’s
daughter. Ingeborg was a bishop’s daughter,
and, naturally, when she was allowed to go
to London to see a dentist, she ran away
on a tourist trip to Europe. Here she met
the pastor, and, somewhat amazedly, found
herself betrothed to him. And she marries
him —not that she loves him —bishops’
daughters are too well brought up to permit
themselves anything so unrefined —but
simply for the usual reason for the majority
of marriages—a suppressed girl’s longing to
get away from the decorous restraints of the
home. She is carried off to Kokensee, in
East Prussia, by her unemotional husband,
and there fulfils the whole duty of the Ger-
man wife, by bearing six children at brief
intervals. Since only two survive, the doc-
tor advises her to stop. Whereupon she
stops, and had leisure to meet the fascinat-
ing artist, Ingram. Ingram, of course, runs
away with hqr to Italy; but Ingeborg is
more interested in Italy than in Ingram—
indeed, she is so much interested in Italy
that she forgets Ingram altogether and runs
away home to her phlegmatic pastor. She
had been so well brought up in her father’s
palace that she did not even know what
she was missing. And her husband has
hardly known that she had left him, being,
indeed, much more interested in manure
than in his wife. Even on his honeymoon
he talked about artificial manure; and he
had entered the Lutheran ministry simply
because it afforded him the leisure to ex-
periment in artificial manures.
The Pastor’s Wife is brilliantly written.
The bishop is a most delightful bishop in
recent fiction —a solemn warning against
anyone choosing a bishop for her father.
Ingeborg, however, strains the reader’s
credulity by her excessive innocence. It is
impossible for any woman to run away with
a man who loves her and not know that she
is being run away with. Even a bishop as
a father could not excuse such an embarrass-
ing lack of sex. And this after she had had
what she delightfully calls “a iwild career of
unbridled motherhood.” By the way, this
is the second recent book, by a woman
author, in which the theme of the book
is the necessity, through “unbridled mother-
hood,” of the husband and wife be-
coming strangers. Are these woman writers
—May Sinclair is the other- —unaware that
such a drastic remedy is not necessary? If
so, they know much less about life than their
works pretend to know. If not, they are
deliberately raising a false issue.
The chief, though accidental, interest in
the book, apart from its bubbling humor, lies
in the delineation of the little village in
East Prussia, and in the character of the
pastor and other typical East Prussians.
We are suddenly curious about the Prus-
sians. The pastor, though Prussian,
conforms to the conventional portrait
of the German school-master, simple,
absorbed, absent-minded, deaf to all
the finer emotions, interested solely in
watching his brain and its workings. He is
no hog. The treatment of the German wife
is interesting, too, especially as Ingeborg is
English. Such treatment would not suit an
Australian. Yet Ingeborg goes repentingly
back to her stolid pastor, and finds herself,
not forgiven, but forgotten. She deserves
her fate.
The Prussian Officer, and Other Stories,
by D. H. Lawrence (Duckworth, per Angus
and Robertson, Sydney), is not a topical war
book. Two of these stories happen to deal
with the brutality of the Prussian officer and
the horrors that the Prussian soldier has to
suffer if he displeases his superior; but
Lawrence is concerned solely for his art:
these stories were probably written long
before the war. The volume does not expose
to us any new facet of D. H. Lawrence’s
curious art. The stories are either minor
echoes of his earlier work, or, more probably,
a collection of early stories, out of which he
has developed his novels. One, certainly, is the
first draft, in short-story form, of a situation
out of which the author evolved his remark-
able play, The Widoiving of Mrs. Holroyd.
Lawrence is French in his frankness in
dealing with subjects that, in England, seem
to occur everywhere except in fiction. Many
of his stories are founded on sex-antagonism ;
others on the brutality of love. “Daughters
of the Vicar” is the story of two girls,
daughters of a hard-up vicar, one of whom
marries a painfully unpleasant man, whose
money could not gloss over —even to his
wife —the fact that his body was unde-
veloped, and his personality deficient in nor-
mal human qualities. The tragedy of this
marriage is a subject peculiarly suitable to
one form of Lawrence’s art. The other side
of his art, the almost brutal description of
passionate love, often in which is mixed,
strangely, the highest appreciation of beauty
and a fierce worship of Nature, is shown
in the love-affair of the other sister. She
falls, in love with the healthy animality of
a young miner, and, strong in her love, suc-
ceeds in winning him. In another story
Lawrence is equally concerned with the kill-
ing of a mole and the birth of a trivial love.
In a third a miner’s wife goes back to meet
her lover, after some years of happy married
life, and finds him a lunatic who does not
know her.
Sordid tragedies nearly all, yet saved from
their obnoxiousness by Lawrence’s art. His
knowledge of the miner and of the life of the
mine is evident in nearly every story. But
from this collection it is impossible to pre-
dict Lawrence’s future. He seems, and has
always seemed, an artist who is struggling
to express himself, but has so far failed.
What there can be no doubt about is that
D. H. Lawrence has something to express.
&
Frank Harris is invariably interesting.
He writes with knowledge of life, and he
belongs to a good school, .the European. But
he is but an echo of the great French and
Russian masters; he has their care for style,
their ingenuous frankness, but not their
genius. The Yellow Ticket, and Other
Stories (Richards, per Dymock’s Library)
provides varied fare. The title story has for
subject the theme that has lately been used
for a drama —the fact that a Jewess cannot
leave her village to go to Moscow, in this
case to study, unless she has for passport
the ticket of the certified prostitute. But
while the drama is mere IJ.S. melodrama,
Harris’s story is a raw slab of real life. “A
Daughter of Eve” is another fresh study in
realism, in which one young girl, by her
unconscious coquetry, works havoc in the
mind of every man in a trading schooner,
and brings tragedy to a married couple.
“Isaac and Rebecca” is one of two dramas
written as drama, but, owing to the fre-
quent changes of scene, almost impossible of
production on a stage. It deals with the
usual Frank Harris subject. “A Miracle
and No Wonder,” the other piece in quasi-
dramatic form, is a delightfully malicious
story of an English wife, who, in order
to have a child, visits a shrine where the
Catholic countrywomen were wont to go for
the same purpose. All you had to do was
to pray at the shrine and then confess to
one of the monks, and the miracle never
failed. But, though she visits the shrine,
there is no miracle for her. For the reason
you must consult Frank Harris. It was a
wise parent who named him Frank.
The Same Old Subject
The most interesting article in the current
issue of the quarterly Round Table (2s.
6d.) —an issue packed with authoritative
articles upon the incidence of the war upon
the Empire—is one dealing with “War and
Financial Exhaustion.”
This Avar will not be ended by the finan-
cial exhaustion of Hogmany. History
records few such endings of wars. “Nothing
could have been more wretched than the
financial affairs of France at the begin-
ning of the Revolutionary period. But
that did not stop her from conquering
Europe. The Balkan States, small, poor
and financially weak, conducted, without
difficulty, two violent campaigns lasting over
many months, and now Servia is fighting
a third war against a far more powerful
opponent. The Boers, even after the whole
framework of their States yvas shattered,
continued the struggle for two years So
long as a Government has a printing-press
it can always make ‘money.’ If an army
can find food, clothing and munitions of
war, it can continue to fight, so long as it
wants to.”
This war will cost the world
£4,000,000,000 per annum. How is that
enormous expense list made up? (1) In
wartime there is much less actual wealth
produced and wealth saved. If it is assumed
that each man produced £lOO of wealth a
year, it is necessary merely to multiply that
sum by the number of soldiers in the armies
engaged to get the total loss under this head.
But, of course, each soldier is not a pro-
ducer, and his place would be taken, to
some extent, by women. (2) There is a
vast reduction in the output of wealth due
to the dislocation of trade, and finance. The
wheels of the machine revolve more slowly
and some of them stop. (3) There is a
great creation of non-productive instead of
productive wealth, of wealth that is pro-
duced only to be immediately destroyed.
The energies of industry are devoted to
making ammunition, guns, etc. (4) In the
countries invaded, millions of pounds’ worth
of property are destroyed. The total result
of these factors is that the annual wealth
produced by any country is much smaller
and its consumption greater. “In a war of
this magnitude, therefore, every country
lives on its capital to some extent, and most
countries to a great extent... .The wealth
of the country diminishes. Nevertheless, a
country can live partly on its capital—just
as a private person can —for a very long
time. In fact, if the inhabitants of a coun-
try restrict their requirements to the essen-
tials of life and existence, and if they can
produce within their own borders enough
food and munitions of war for themselves
and their soldiers, and if they continue
to believe in the credit of their Government
sufficiently to take payment in paper money,
there is - nothing to prevent them continuing
the struggle indefinitely. It all depends
on whether they w r ant t0....1f the suffer-
ings of the non-combatant population are not
intolerable, if, in fact, the will to fight still
prevails, and all hope of ultimate victory
is not wholly extinguished, a country which
is self-supporting can go on almost indefi-
nitely, certainly as long as a European war
such as the present is likely for other rea-
sons to last.” Germany, as the author
shows, is not within sight of defeat yet.
The world cannot fling £4,000,000,000
away per annum without suffering a terrible
set-back. “It is possible that immediately
after the war there may be a short period
of seeming prosperity, a small boom for a
year or two while the absolute necessities
of civilisation are being replaced; but the
lack of capital on the one hand and the
greatly reduced purchasing power of the
world’s population on the other, must soon
tell, and there must inevitably be then a
more or less prolonged period of stagnation
and depression, while each country is build-
ing up its reserves of capital. The world
after the war will be just like an engine
whose fires have been allowed to die down.
It will be necessary to build them up and
heat the boilers up again, before there will
bo enough steam to enable the world to
move again at the pace it has been doing
in the last decade.... The country which
will recover the- quickest after the war will
be that one whose population devote them-
selves with the greatest energy to replacing
what has been lost.” Australia?
Meantime, it is well to remember that
the only way to defeat the Bruteonic Race
i 3 to defeat the Hogman army. Financial
or economic considerations will decide
this war. “Our business is to beat Ger-
many in the field.” And there is only one,
factor that will give Britain the victory—
command of the sea. And if the British
Navy is defeated: “Then 'Sreat Britain and
all her Dominions would lose everything:
empire, possession, shipping and commerce.
Their Colonies would be taken, their coaling
stations seized, • their ships sunk and their
commerce destroyed. All that would be an
easy task for a victorious fleet. Neither
Conventions nor Declarations, neither Hague
Tribunals nor Laws of Nations would pre-
vent our foes from employing every weapon
to their hand for our destruction.”
So our tremendous task is to smash the
Hogman fleet and drive the Hogmen out of
Belgium, not by throttling or bottling Hog-
many, but by the bayonet thrust and.
the good shooting of the 13.5 gun. “The
result of the war [quoting now another
Round Table article] up to the present has
been that Germany, though foiled in her
first plan, has still won a marked success.
She holds, and holds firmly, the very
strategic position it has been the chief end
of her rulers to retain. If peace were made
now on the terms that each party should
keep what it occupied, Germany would have
won the war.” So there is nothing else to
it. We have to bayonet the Bruteonic Race
back to the Rhine, “and there is no real sign
as yet that the German armies are in any
way unnerved, or that the courage and per-
sistence of the German people have
weakened.”
The most topically interesting of _ the
magazines is Cartoons Magazine, a Chicago
monthly. It consists almost entirely of war
cartoons, with war articles to fill the inter-
stices. For the cartoon expresses with the
utmost lucidity and the most extreme
economy of means the hidden psychology of
the nations. For us the chief value of this
magazine lies in its reproduction of Hog-
rflan cartoons and Hogman newspaper
articles. And in the cartooning business
the artists of Jtjgend and Simplicissimus
easily hold their own with the rest of the'
world. They have a brutal strength, some-
times equalled by the French cartoonists,
never by the English, except by Will Dyson,
and, too rarely, by Norman Lindsay. Two of
his cartoons are reproduced in the January
issue, though so little does Chicago know of
the Commonwealth that the cartoons are
acknowledged to “Sidney Bulletin.” The
French cartoonists show their traditional
elegance, and the British cartoons are —the
only word that fits them is gentlemanly.
From the Hogman cartoons, however, one
gets a glimpse into the depths of the Hogman
“soul” —if hogs have souls. The English
Tommy is invariably depicted as a High-
lander in kilts—the kilts seem to the Hog-
man the funniest thing on earth. And there
is a diabolical cleverness in the Hogman
pictures of Tommy’s face, the chief features
of which are its protruding teeth and its
enormous pipe. King George and the Czar
are caricatured with a clever malignity,
while the Prince of Wales is invariably
pictured as a weak child of ten years. The
only reply to the charge of Bruteonic barbari-
ties is to fling that charge at the Allies, A
cartoon, “Culture and Barbarism,” shows
the methods of the Allies —Hogmen tortured,
children slain, dum-dum bullets, Hogmen
killed under the red-cross flag; while the
Hogmen are shown succoring the wounded,
smilingly carrying Belgian children and
helping Belgian women to escape! Well
drawn, too. From the translated Hogman
articles we learn that after their first battle
“the English ran so quickly that our cavalry
was unable to keep up with them,” though
it is admitted that “Tommy as a soldier is
as brave as the soldier of any other coun-
try. Our “thorough defeat in Belgium and
France was not Tommy’s fault but that of
his officers, who though they do not lack per-
sonal bravery understand less of military
science than the officers of any other Euro-
pean State.” Yet the Hogman now admits,
with amazement, the world-wide hatred of
Hogmany. “For the first time it has come
to our consciousness how deep and bitter
is _ the hatred against Germany and every-
thing that is German, not only among our
enemies, but much further throughout the
world. Wells, the author who has been far
over-rated by us, has become almost mad with
gall. Bernard Shaw, whom Germany has
made celebrated and rich, foams with rage
at Prussian militarism.... We have heard
enough within the last three months to know
that our nation finds very little genuine
friendship in its struggle for existence. But
why are we so hated that we are to be pro-
scribed and excluded from the society of civi-
lised mankind ?” The reason is obvious—to
the Bruteon. “Not our shortcomings and
frailties —our good qualities are what they
cannot forgive us. They hate us because we
have this precious inner unrest, for we spoil
the easy-going world. Our technical and
business methods compel them to think
harder —even to work.” Also, the British
would rather play football. It is a staggered
and chastened Hogmany that concludes:
“We shall hereafter be less eager to strive
for the approbation of other countries, as
we have been doing heretofore freely and
even excessively.” Even Hogmany now sees
it is no use. The world has found the
Bruteon out
Why We Are at War (Clarendon Press,
Oxford; 2s. 9d. out here) is Great Britain’s
case presented by members of the Oxford
Faculty of Modern History. The authors
are not politicians, and belong to different
schools of thought. An admirable produc-
tion.
The authors rightly refer to Britain’s pas-
sivity in the face of the German naval
threat: “On German principles we should
long ago have adopted the ‘offensive-defen-
sive.’ We have been at least as seriously
menaced by Germany at sea as Germany has
been menaced by Russia on land. But we
can confidently say that in the period of
rivalry our fleet has never been used as a
threat, or turned to the purposes of an
aggressive colonial policy. Rightly or
wrongly, we have refused to make possible
intentions a case for an ultimatum.” In the
chapter upon “The New German Theory of
the State,” the authors point out that the
war is a struggle between two nations, one
of which claims a prerogative to act outside
and above the public law of Europe in order
to secure the “safety” of its own State,
while the other stands for the rule of public
law, and for the small nations which it pro-
tects. The appendices include the German
White-Lie Book and the Russian Orange
Book, and extracts from the Belgian Grey
Book.
From The Times (London) Literary
Supplement A. Clutton-Brock reprints his
charming essays, Thoughts on the War
(Methuen; Is.). There is no hatred nor
malice, no fury nor exhortation, in these
delightful little pieces of literature. Quiet
reading for minds that nowadays would be
quiet.
What is a german?
The world thought it knew the german—
it is hardly fair on an unoffending capital
letter to associate it any longer with this
word; but this war has shown that the
essential german is—what? It is evident
that we need a new definition for the ger-
man ; none of the older definitions will do.

Can be Developed to Normal.
It matters not if you have been thin and scYaggly for years, even if you
never were properly developed your measurements can be increased to normal
and your figure nicely rounded out to pleasing, plump proportions. It is
done every day for others —why not you ?
Manager. Fall i ere Co. Hekeia, N.z.
Dear Sir.—l am well pleased with the results from using Flesh-
Food and the general improvement in my condition, for which
I thank you very much indeed, for my husband and I are both
well pleased.
From the very beginning I improved wonderfully—the giddiness that had bothered
me for years disappeared, as did the rheumatism from my legs. Both of these
troubles bad caused me much severe suffering.
My limbs were thinnest, and they began to noticeably increase first of all, ending
in a nine-inch increase in my hip measurement. A general development now became
noticeable, and my chest and bust filled out.
_ I bad now sained all I needed—a full stone in weight. As I have lost neither
weight nor measurements since stopping the treatment, I consider the results per-
manent. Yours very truly, MRS. H. HODGES.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond question, and its
use is no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week,
and an increase in bust measurement up to eight and ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers
relief and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever
possessing a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment that adds weight and
permanent development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Soz. to lOoz. in
the week. It' is now 12 months since 1 last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the ieast desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

Next Door.
Whenever I’m moving my furniture in
Or shifting my furniture out —
Which is nearly as often and risky as Sin
In these days of shifting about —
There isn’t a stretcher, there isn't a stick,
Nor a mat that belongs to the floor;
There isn’t a pot ( Oh, my heart groweth
sick!)
That escapes from the glare of Next
1 )oor!
The Basilisk Glare of Next Door.
Be it morn, noon or night—be it early or
late;
Be it summer or winter or spring,
I cannot sneak down just to list at the gate
For the song that the bottle-o’s sing;
With some bottles to sell that shall bring
me a beer,
And lead up to one or two more ;
But I feel in my backbone the serpentine
sneer,
And the Basilisk Glare of Next Door.
The political women Next Door.
I really can’t say, being no one of note,
Why she glares at my odds and my ends,
Excepting, maybe, I’m a frivolous Pote,
With one or two frivolous friends,
Who help me to shift and to warm up the
house
For three, four or five hours or more,'
In a suburb that hasn’t the soul of a louse ;
And they’ve got no respect for Next Door!
They don’t core a straw for Next Boor.

HENRY LAWSON.
The Sluggards.
Bill Bushy, down to see the Show,
Sprang from his coffee-palace bed
When dawn her first rose-tinted glow
Beneath his window-curtain shed ;
And, dressing with accustomed haste,
Straight down the silent passage raced.
Soiled boots stood guard outside each room,
And, save for, now and then, a snore,
A silence deep as of the tomb
Enwrapped the empty corridor;
As restlessly he walked and long,
“I’m sure,” moaned Bill, “there’s somethin’
wrong!”
An hour he paced ; at six o’clock
There came a maid with pan and broom,
Who thumped the skirting-board. The shock
Roused Bill from broodings fraught with
gloom.
He spoke the girl: “I say, me dear,
When do they start th’ milkin’ ’ere?”

The World and I Got Drunk.
N.S.W.
I smiled upon tlie wide world,
Towards the bar I slunk,
And then —or some time after
The world and I got drunk!
Oh, gay was life and brimming;
Well wined and fed and girled;
And jollily my good friend,
The green old earthball, whirled.
And all things, gaily blithered,
Went staggering around ;
Where’er I trod I marched on
Inebriated ground.
The trams had all a stagger,
They leaped right cneerily ;
And as I tried to board one
It jumped away from me.
Still that w r as but good humor
And done in merry play ;
Am I a man to censure
A tram for going gay?
The lamps and posts kept dancing
And twisted in strange bends ;
Sometimes I held them steady
For they and I seemed friends.
The buildings joined, in with me
(Some very nearly fell),
And in my glad good-friendship
I rang them by the bell.
And staid and stolid persons
Seemed on the jag a-roam.
I linked my arm with many
And told them to go home.
For even when I’m mellow
’Tis somehow sad to me
To see a grey-beard lose his
Respectability.
A parson, grey but gladsome,
Came dickering to view;
“What ho! my gay sky-pilot!
What, are you shickered too?”
He staggered backward from me.
I saw he scarce Could stand ;
He was so blindly joyful
He could not see my hand.
With firm but quiet insistence
I took him on my way.
For in his ripe condition
I could not let him stay.
We met with merry sailors
And citizens full ripe:
With beer and wine and whisky
And cigarette and pipe;
And music it was flowing;
And laughter it ran free.
When we got drunk together.
The whole darned world and me!
The stars were in the revel.
They danced and spun and gleamed.
The very clouds above us
Of beery fulness seemed.
But how the gay night finished,
Or where I chanced to go
To bed I can’t remember.
And do not want to know.
Within my vague remembrance
The last that I could see,
Were laughter-lighted faces
On every side of me ;
Policemen, clowns and sailors,
Swells, writers, men who paint,
Grey-bearded men and beardless,
Five parsons and a saint!

It is the duty of a country which is free from
foreign debt to export sufficient to pay for
what it imports, else it will assuredly get
into debt and leave a burden on its chil-
dren. In the case of a country which is
already deeply indebted abroad, the least it
can do, if it proposes to be a man and not
a worm, is to either reduce its imports, or
increase its exports, or do a bit of each, till
the surplus of exports covers the whole
foreign interest bill. If it wants to be a
gentleman as well as a man, it will try to
make the surplus of exports a little more
than the amount of the interest bill, so as
to diminish the debt and reduce the burden
upon those who come after it. _ And by fol-
lowing the honest course it will have its
reward, for it will make profitable work for
the local inhabitant, and reduce his interest
bill, as well as doing a little to release his
offspring from slavery. It is no good for
Australia to quote the example of Britain in
this matter. Britain has vast sums of
money lent abroad, and the interest that
comes in enables it to buy more than it sells,
and still remain solvent. Australia has vast
sums owing abroad, and the interest that
goes out makes it necessary that it should
export much more than it imports, in order
to remain solvent.

Last year the Labor party in power delib-
erately ' deprived the people of some
£22 000,000 or £23,000,000 worth of work,
and the Labor majority which runs the party
concurred with enthusiasm. The UoveTn-
ment, by reason of its insane tariff, robbed
the people of over £6,000,000 worth of nob
by excess of imports over exports, in order
that our goods might be made by foreign
cheap labor instead of well-paid Australian
labor. It deliberately plundered the people
of another £16,000,000 worth of job by bor-
rowing the money with which to pay the
foreign interest bill instead of paying it
with local products. It deliberately pawned
the unfortunate suckling to the foreign
money-lender for more than £22.000,000 in
one year, so that the old man might be dis-
satisfied, unreliable, disgruntled, untrained
and out of employment. The charge which
is laid at the door of the Australian Laborite,
like the dead body which was laid at the
gate of the burgomaster of Leyden during
the siege, is that he would sooner starve his
wife and family than interfere with the
profits of that great capitalist the importer,
many specimens of whose tribe are foreign
enemies, and ought to be in gaol for at-
tempts to trade with the foreign enemy in
war-time. Another charge is that he would
sooner sell his descendants as bondsmen and
bondswomen to the foreign money-lender,
even until the one-hundredtli generation,
than learn to be a capable artisan and make
his own goods.
* * * *
Recently a strenuous little Labor paper,
the Navvy, set forth that it was the duty of
a Labor Government to find work for every
man who wanted work. The idea is excel-
lent, and if the Labor party ceased, to sink
the fiscal issue, and adhered to its non-
borrowing gospel, and insisted that this
country should export enough to pay for its
imports and to cover the interest on its
foreign debt, there would last year have
been £22,000.000 or £23,000,000 worth more
work than there was, and the disgrace of
pawning the baby to the European capi-
talist would have been avoided. Unfor-
tunately it is the Labor policy to regard the
local manufacturer who pays the highest
possible wages as an enemy, and the foreign
one, who pays half, or less than half, these
wages, as a friend. The local capitalist,
who probably owns £lO,OOO or so, is held to
be a curse, and the foreign multi-million-
aire is a blessing. When the doctrine is
laid down that it is the duty of the Govern-
ment to find work for everybody, it is never
intended that the work should consist ot the
manufacture, for local consumption, ot
boots, hats, clothes, shirts, feminine frills,
dredges, ships, miscellaneous ironware, or
anything else which can only pay wages
according to the value of the goods pro-
duced. The scheme is always that the
State should borrow money and charge the
principal and interest to our grandchildren.
That it should build new railways regard-
less of the fact that the old . railways are
mostly run at a loss. That it should pay
just as much wages as the borrowed money
will run to, even if it costs 20s. to construct
a bit of congested line which won’t pay
interest on 10s. This saves responsibility,
for the loss is left to future generations.
It saves the further responsibility of finding
out how to run industries on a remunera-
tive basis. And it saves a third responsi-
bility, because Labor is saved the unpleasant
job of speaking harshly to its capitalistic
god, the importer.
* * *
The Bulletin has read hundreds of
appeals by unemployed Laborites who
wanted work. But it can’t remember more
than one or two appeals for work of the
kind which supplies pants and shirts to
meet the local demand and tends to elim-
inate that most bumptious and Tory and
low-wage capitalist, the dealer in foreign
products. All the rest were based on the
theory that the country should wreck its
local industries, and sell its small boy and
baby girl to the pawnbroker, in order that
the old man may be moderately busy at high
wages in building the hopeless railway to
Brown’s Ruins or some town of the sort.
The loan and importing and public works
and capitalistic disease has got this country s
Labor party down.
POLITICAL TRUCE AND THE PARTY
SWINDLE.
Tiie Allies in the grim siege-war now
polluting France and Belgium appear to be
getting forward at the rate of inches per
day; yet such progress is rapid compared
with the advance of plain political common-
sense against the intrenched positions of
prejudice and do-as-we-always-did. It is
quite true that do-as-we-always-did is a
mythical proposition, and that the conser-
vatism of one age fights fiercely to uphold
the very things which the conservatism of a
previous age denounced as dangerous inno-
vations; hut that has no more to do with
the actual position in the political trenches
than the Belgian outrages have to do with
the German valor that hurls itself upon
bayonets in the name of the Fatherland.
The conservative mind, whether it calls itself
Liberal or Labor, is always blind in its
historical eye. If it could read the past
intelligently there would be few difficult
problems in the present.
There has been a revival of talk about the
nature of the political truce which, in spite
of Cook’s occasional uproar and other
interruptions, is supposed to be in operation.
The idea that because there is a smell ot
gunpowder in our nostrils our legislators
should be idle is as stupid as it is
mischievous. Australia has no use for such
a truce. What it wants and what it ought
to have is a permanent political peace. This
country has work to do—big work, earnest
work. Under ordinary circumstances it pays
an enormous number of politicians fixed
salaries to do that work, and doesn’t get it
done to any extent. Instead of honest work
for an honest wage politicians give us a dull
and unending party contest, which as a
show has long ceased to be interesting, and
as a means of helping the country forward
is as futile as the meowing of cats on the
house roof or the rage of fourponny beer-
patriots after a Zeppelin raid. The strife
of the ins and outs in the par „ absurdity
does not rise to the dignity of battle.
Imagine any sane person describing
Fitzpatrick’s angry chatter or Cook’s
impotent frothing as warfare! Would
anybody ever dream of paying these men
salaries merely for the scrap they could put
up with their tongues? What ehance in a
plain contest of abuse would all our
politicians put together have with Chippen-
dale Sue or Collingwood Sal or some other
ladies well known to the police, who get
nothing at all for outpourings of impassioned
eloquence, which differ only in subject matter
from the political efforts by which our
legislators earn nine-tenths of their salaries?
The thing called political truce offers no
remedy for the disease of party. It merely
means that the eternal wrangle about
nothing in particular is toned down or
altogether muzzled until such time as it
may be renewed without the enemy over-
hearing it; but the causes which make the
wrangle possible are to remain unchanged,
and it is understood that since politicians
have ceased to bleat, blither or fume, they
are to sit down and do nothing
except draw their salaries and nurse their
low-comedy party-wratli until the war is
over. As the war shows no sign of being
over, but is, in fact, lacing up its boots for
a fresh effort, the political truce would seem
to be an aggravation of the permanent
swindle of party government, and, as such, is
pretty rough on the average Australian who
is already beginning to count the coppers in
his trousers pocket and wonder what has
become of the threepenny bit he intended to
spend on the missus. A truce might be all
right if there were nothing to be done.
There were some small communities in the
Pacific that got on well enough with a
Government consisting of a white missionary
and a bi’own Sunday-school superintendent
because there was nothing to worry about
except the supply of cocoanuts arid bread-
fruit. But Australia isn’t exactly a country
of that kind. There is so much to be done
that at ordinary times the citizen is apt to
disarrange and strain his whiskers with
eager thought as to the possibility of the
people of this country ever catching up in
the race of nations ; and at the present hour,
with an out-size in wars blowing holes in
civilisation, the task is bigger than ever
before. Instead of sitting down and doing
nothing our legislators should be working
overtime, not with their jaws, but with every
ounce of brain they possess, to set crooked
matters straight and lift Australia past a
big crisis in its history. If we can afford
to allow our legislators to remain idle now
there is no reason why they should ever be
otherwise than idle; and if there is no work
for them ever to do, in the name of our
common objection to being regarded as
insane, why pay them for pretending to do
it? To pay them for unprofitable party
gabble is bad enough; to pay them for
nothing is a trifle worse.
* * * *
Of course, there are those who will argue
plausibly that the money spent on merely
keeping the average politician quiet is well
spent; but this argument only amounts to
saying that the democracy which chose the
politician to do its work was a fool, and
should not have had a vote at all. The
average Australian politician is certainly
not an outstanding genius, and the method
by which he secures his job or rest or screw
or whatever it is doesn’t exactly redound to
the credit of the public intelligence; but,
making all allowances, he ought to be
capable of doing some work, and he ought
to be kept at it. The trouble is that the
rope of party ties him hand and foot and
brain, and leaves nothing but his tongue
loose. Get rid of party and there is no need
for a political truce or other contrivance
for keeping the legislators of Australia from
doing Australia’s work. If they do the work
badly we can throw them on the scrap-heap
at next election and give their jobs to better
men; but let them have a reasonable
opportunity to show what they are made of
and whether with freedom from the absurd
party claims they cannot, after all, do a
reasonable day’s work for a reasonable wage.
* * * *
The method of securing the abolition of
the party insanity by the establishment of
elective Ministries is simple enough ; but as
this is a time of crisis something more
picturesque and sudden may be demanded.
If it is, the strict censorship of the press to
which we have become accustomed might
supply us with the idea. Political parties in
Australia are nothing more than names
and labels. To mark a. man Labor or
Liberal gives no idea of his contents. He
is not guaranteed under the Pure Food or
any other Act. He may be a Freetrader, a
Protectionist, a States Spiter, a Unificationist,
a fool, or merely some whisky and talk. Let
a short measure be framed making it a penal
offence on the part of either legislator or
ordinary citizen to use a political label or
speak of adherence to any party, group or
clique. Widen the wording of the enact-
ment to include every kind of political
combination inside and outside of Parlia-
ment, and make the conditions so stringent
that every citizen would be compelled to keep
his teeth locked lest the criminal word or
idea should escape his lips. Before three
months were over the trick would be done.
Then there could be no need for a political
truce, for Parliament would be actually at
work and the permanent political peace
would have arrived. Possibly it would be
sufficient to confine the great effort to
Federal politics and allow the old party idea
to run itself to death in the State Legis-
latures. It would not be long before the
public, noting the contrast in the two
spheres, got after the State animal with an
axe. Labor supporters might, violently
oppose this or any more prosaic way of
dealing with the great party nuisance on
the ground that Labor had in the past
fought all parties and . combinations of
parties, and that now in its day of victory
it intended to use the party idea for all it
was worth to hold what it had gained. The
answer to That is simple. Let any Labor
man light his pipe, sit down in a shady place
and think long and hard until he finds out
the things which Labor as a party organisa-
tion has gained for him personally which
labor votes in a non-party system would not
have gained for him earlier and more
effectively. Then let him think of the
things which Labor as a party has not gained
for him which might have been gained if
there had been no parties at all. If he
thinks long enough and hard enough he will
presently jump on his hat and declare that
he has no use for a political truce or for the
party swindle in any form*
PLAIN ENGLISH.
German Preference for Australians.
The curious and twice-repeated statement in
the cables that Australians are getting better
treatment in Germany and Belgium than the
people of the other countries mixed up in the
war seems to indicate that somebody has
been pitching strange yarns to the Kaiser
about this Commonwealth. The official notion
of us in the places behind the 17-inch
howitzers appears to be that we are on the
eve of rebellion, ready to draw up a Declara-
tion of Rights, to haul down the flag, to put
bombs under the Governor-General, to call
George Reid home and make him king or
emperor or chief banqueter, or something,
and generally to prove that we are a wildly
adventurous people worthy to sit on the re-
formed map of the world beside all-powerful
Germany, President Wilson and the ragged
remnant of the Turks. It is not very hard
to see how an idea of that sort was exported
to Kaiserland. The people of this continent
are about as loyal to every honest and pro-
gressive idea that Britain stands for (and to
many ideas that are neither particularly
honest nor overpoweringly progressive) as
any of the young nations that stick the
Union Jack in the top corner of their flag.
Perhaps underneath the upper part of our
waistcoats we are more loyal than most,
though as a nation we don’t show it so flag-
rantly. At the same time, there is no place
in the world where the flams and shams of
England get freer criticism by the man in
the pub, the street or the outback shearing-
shed. We have very little use for gold hats,
black rods and the wearisome routine or
mediaeval splendor or for that general atti-
tude of grovel which the ancient Briton loves
to assume before anything that calls ltselt
his better. But in spite of all this, and
under it all, England has still something that
holds a lot of our respect, and the Englisn-
man, when shaken up and ironed opt, is so
much the twin brother of the Australian tha
if he doesn’t get any worse we can tolerate
his partnership for a long time to come. Hv -
dently the people who reported on us to
Wilhelm must have heard some ot our ie-
marks about State Governors and other
gilded ornaments; and as it isn tin the Ge
man mind to understand that a ..
would throw a brick at a useless function-
ary might be perfectly willing t° get shot
defending what was worth while in the coun
try that bred that functionary, the reports
that reached Potsdam were ent i£- 7 tb t
able. Nobody whispered to the Ka ser that
six English cocked hats might produce only
Chant of Hate and Tripe and Onions.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A chant, a song, a “Hymn of Hate” for you,
camerados.
Something fierce, something more earnest
and sour than the chant of hate of
Ernest Lissatjer, sung before the
Kaiser, at Kiel, by the Submarine
Chorus;
Something plain and ungarnished ;
Something without mystery and rudder-
strokes and sausages in it.
Something about Tripe and Onions!
A Chant of Tripe and Onions !
One cannot indict a whole nation, but one
can feel d —d sorry for it.
Moreover, it can feel sorry for itself.
So let it be; so will it be with Germany—
against Stupidity the gods themselves
struggle in vain.
Unreflecting, unrelenting Hate is mere
Stupidity.
Chants of Hate are utter and supreme sense-
lessness.
This chant would be wholly fatuous were it
confined to hate, camerados.
It is redeemed by Tripe and Onions!
I hate wet feet, dirty linen, drunken persons,
corns and tight boots, unwiped glasses,
public boodlers, limp collars, foul air,
half-cooked food, stop-out cats, canine
tenors, cheap pianos, snobs, microscopic
print, tangled fishing-lines, bad oysters,
flat beer, unnecessary noises, fleas, un-
ripe fruit, influenza and *~any other
odious things.
But do I hate the Germans?
Do you?
I hate the brutal, pompous, criminal lunatics
who have led, or driven, the German
Empire to ruin.
I hate the posing militarists, the prosing
professors, the glozing officials, the nosing
spies of Germany.
But they are not the Germans.
If the German people had not been blind-
folded, they, themselves, could have
looked into the Abyss ; and they would
have shuddered and drawn back.
But their leaders, or guides, pushed them
forward with great shoutings. On! on!
to Glory!
On, on to Paris — Calais — London —Warsaw
— anywhere!
And their poets wrote premature Songs of
Triumph.
Now they are writing Chants of Hate!
Believe me, camerados, what Germany will
need in the end are hymns of Tripe and
Onions.
They “have one foe, and one alone,” and it
is not England.
It is Stupidity, Colossal Egoism.
Germany is going to be very poor and
hungry;
Chants of Hate will be cheaper than Iron
Crosses.
But a real poet will arise and make an
Ode to Black Bread, and a Song to
Sauerkraut, and Hymns to Blutwurst
and Leherwurst, and wiirst mit knoh-
lauch, and a Paean to Plain Food !
Why should you, or I, waste time and
expend good cerebral matter in answer-
ing absurd Chants of Hate?
The Kaiser, and the singing submariners of
Kiel, and the ennobled Ernest
Lissatjer declare that they will never
forego their hate, and never again look
upon us as Huns and brethren.
Who wants them to?
Let them have their Hate, camerados. Give
us the Tripe and Onions !
N.S.W.
O. C. CABOT.


mockery, while one of the German pattern
would provoke bullets. A cocked hat, or the
German equivalent, is such a sacred thing
where the Kaiser rules that mockery of it
could mean nothing short of rebellion. And
so we have come to be misunderstood to the
advantage of a few of our fellow citizens
who have strayed into Belgium or over the
Rhine.
A
A Juridical Outrage.
What is to be done about the scandalous
Eather case? The prime function of
Appeal Courts is to give form and symmetry
to the general body of jurisprudence. An
authoritative tribunal of the sort is abso-
lutely necessary in every civilised commu-
nity ; and since under our system the men
of talent are inevitably drawn into the
national arena and away from the service
of individual States, it is in the national
arena and by the High Court of Australia
that our code must be moulded, if at all.
With an integral part of that code the High
Court now declines to be bothered. Eather’s
case is one of a class which is based upon
the law of corroboration. The section
speaks of corroborative evidence “implicat-
ing the accused.” The judicial construction
of what it is that “implicates” is a matter
which goes to the root of the law upon
corroboration, and its interpretation exacts
the last word in legal skill. The High Court
is equipped to supply this skill, and the
State Courts are not. One of the most dis-
tinguished of the High Court judges has in
effect said so, and has not been specifically
contradicted by his colleagues. As there
are no means of ascertaining the law, it
becomes impossible for counsel in these cases
to conduct defences in a proper manner. Yet
Eather’s case is of a class which is recog-
nised by criminal lawyers the world over as
requiring the strictest investigation. Eatiier
may or may not be guilty ; but the position
at this moment is that he is in gaol in
respect of an offence which has not in any
legal sense been properly inquired into.
Indeed, Justice Isaacs has publicly said
that the interpretation of the law which put
him there is worse than erroneous. Never-
theless this interpretation is the only thing
which Bench and Bar have to go upon in
trying the Eatiiers of the future. It seems
incredible that a brand-new Constitution can
be publicly defaced by those who are partly
responsible for its custody, and that citizens
can be put in peril of having to face criminal
charges to which no known formal answer
exists; yet so it is. And until the High
Court either does, or is compelled to do, its
duty, so it will remain.

Maoriland Sticks to Massey.
The result of the re-contested election for
Dunedin East has been to remove previous
uncertainty about the strength of Maoriland
parties, the return of Statham in place of
Labor’s nominee, Munro, giving Massey a
majority of two. The WARD-ites, who for a
time thought they had the other side by the
throat, will therefore have the leisure they
earned, during their five years of spend-
thrift recklessness, for further rumination on
the cussedness of things. To add to their
old offence they went unrepentant to the
polls, and thus doubly deserved the vote of
want of confidence they got. The humilia-
tion of it to a party once so powerful and
effective is dire indeed; but unless Ward
and his friends have stomach for the truth
and are prepared even at this late hour to
learn the lessons of the ballot-box —to purge
themselves first of a childish vanity which
leads them to give ear only to the sycophant
with the adulatory word in his ready mouth
—nothing is more certain than that the
future is not for them. Judging by the
utterances of Ward and his lieutenants, they
do not even now realise that their policy of
borrow and boom, of petty sops and spine-
less evasions, is repugnant to the great mass
of the people; and they will not see that
many even of those who vote for them do so
in despair. The plight of Labor in the
Loanly Isles is unfortunate to the last
degree. Accustomed for so long to the role
of the poor relation, wasting power in
fatuously chasing round after false gods and
American “Professors,” it seems incapable
of either crystallising a policy or mobilising
its forces. Yet the pressure of circumstance
must inevitably cure this —and before long.
Then perhaps Maoriland, debt-ridden and
foot-sore through eternal pilgrimages to the
pawnshop, may see the birth of a party
prepared because of its sobriety to end the
long disreputable drunk of years. In the
meantime Massey can be depended on to
keep fillin’ ’em up again by furiously borrow-
ing from anybody with thruppence to spare,
while Ward rends the air with asseverations
that he’d do the same thing very much
better. The only redeeming features about
the whole business are that the Civil Service
is controlled rather more decently now than
by the Liberals, and that the crew in office
have reasonably sane ideas about defence —
which Ward hasn’t, and most likely never
will have.
_—
The Day of Extra Gloom.
The question of closing picture-shows on
the Sawbath is burning again in Melbourne.
At present they are all suppressed by order
of the various councils, and the Gaud Mayor
is receiving thanks on the one hand from
wowsers, and protests on the other hand
from other sorts of citizens. A deputation
from the Australian Theatrical Amusement
Employees’ Association waited on him the
other day to tell him that 2000 members
were strongly in favor of Sunday shows ; and
as a counterblast the Age has been shriek-
ing in his ear that “pictures” are not more
entitled to a Sunday license than the older
forms of entertainment. Drama, opera and
ballet have as much claim as the cinemato-
granh, says the Age logician. But the
A.T.A.E. Assoc, doesn’t ask for Sunday
licensing of theatrical performances. It
wants only the dumb entertainment which
has been prepared by the mummer before-
hand. Moreover, the police see a difference
between the two classes of entertainment,
wherefore they are in favor of the conces-
sion to picture shows, but are not in favor
of breaking down all the Sabbatarian
barriers. Speaking from experience, they
declare that picture-shows are good for
lawanorder and public morals inasmuch as
they lure the unemployed from liquor,
rowdyism and gross indiscretions in the
parks.. And the wowsers themselves know
there is a difference. True, they talk now
of the film as the frivolous forerunner of the
ballet; but they are quite well aware that
it is the acknowledged dissipation of those
wowsers who would never “set foot in a
theatre.” The Age logic is no good. Why
should the cine, be allowed to rush in where
the coryphee may not kick? it asks. Why,
The Bulletin asks in reply, should race-
course betting be permitted by the law which
forbids gambling hells? Technical incon-
sistency is the soul of good government. In
London the powerful Sunday League runs
orchestral concerts on Sunday by favor of
the authorities. In Melbourne picture show-
men have a claim to the same concession.
The working staffs are with them. The
police are with them. The weight of public
opinion is with them. Only a small Sab-
batarian section is against them; but owing
to. its organised method of snuffling, this
minority makes a great noise, like a German
band, and the peace-loving authorities often
pay it to go away.
Another Strike.
The medical profession of N. S. Wales is
again up in arms. This time its quarrel is
not with the friendly societies but with the
Government. The trouble is over the
recently-established venereal clinics. The
Holman Government lacked the nerve to
go the entire reform hog and make venereal
disease notifiable in the way that compara-
tively trivial complaints like diphtheria and
small-pox are. But it sensed the public
feeling on this question with sufficient
accuracy to know that something had to be
done. Hence the clinics, where afflicted
persons may be treated freely and privately,
and thus be saved, incidentally, from ruin-
ing other lives besides their own. The medical
profession,. which has mostly jeered at the
practicability of compulsory notification
(just as in another generation it jeered at
antisepsis, and anaesthetics, and as only last
year it jeered at Paulin’s wonderful
antalgesine, which has done so much for
the wounded in the great War), is equally
hostile to the clinics. Not, however, because
the clinics represent a rather feeble half
measure; not because they are a new idea;
but because they stand to lessen the doctors’
incomes to some small extent. On the lat-
ter ground the 8.M.A., despite the Health
Minister’s plea that the subject should be
discussed with him before any definite move
was taken, decided last week to go on strike
against the new institution. Consider what
it means. Commission after Commission,
both in the Commonwealth and in Maori-
land, have establised that Australasia, like
so many other regions where most of the
inhabitants live near great ports, is riddled
with venereal disease. It is the duty of
the politicians, in the interests of the race,
to grapple with this horror. The N. S. Wales
Government has taken such courage as it
possesses, if not in both hands, at least
between the thumb and finger-tips of one
hand, and has attempted something which
should palliate, even though it must fail to
destroy, the great curse. The doctors
don’t deny that the new arrangement will
benefit the public health. A truthful expert
would not question, if he were asked as man
to man, that it may save thousands of inno-
cent people from lives of shame and agony.
Their only objection is that it may interfere
with their wages. Speaking to this point
one big practitioner put the B.M.A. position
with hideous clearness by “complaining with
bitterness of the travelling ophthalmic hospi-
tal, which had started straight away to
inspect and treat school-children in every
populous town from Sydney to Albury.” It
was nothing to him, seemingly, that the
children needed treatment. It did not occur
to him that it may be as beneficial
for the community to have sound eyes
as sound drains. All he could see in the
matter was the problematical loss of a few
pounds a year to the eye-specialists. The
medical profession has enjoyed in the past
a high reputation for philanthropy and
public-spiritedness, and in very many cases
it has been well deserved. That reputation
has brought scores of very material advan-
tages-—advantages which are not accorded,
say, to the dock-laborer or wharf-lumper.
The tendency of the modern doctor is to
demand the respect and consideration which
were given to the best stamp of old-time
medico, together with the license to strike or
otherwise defy the law of the land, which
appears to be one of the established privileges
of the poorest variety of laborer. A cir-
cumstance which the profession should be
made to understand is that it can’t have
things both ways.
4
Victory and the Tariff.
When Andrew Fisher gets seriously to
work on his tariff, which he said was “to
give adequate protection to every branch of
Australian manufacturing industry,” it will
be necessary to take into serious considera-
tion the industrial state of the Teutonic
countries after the war. If the Allies win, as
of course they will, Germany and Austria
will be smitten with a terrific war indemnity
—it may be two thousand millions sterling.
To get that heap of coin together the Teutons
will have to sell an enormous quantity of
goods abroad and work long hours for
the least possible wage that will support
life. In fact, to the working masses of
Germans and Austrians defeat in this war
spells something like slavery for this genera-
tion at least. Their economic lords will seek
to flood the markets of the world with their
goods, and unless Andrew Fisher builds
his tariff wall high and strong—stronger and
higher than ever before —those German
goods will soar clean over it. The difference
between the wages paid and the working
conditions in Australia and Germany was
considerable before the war started ; but in
the evil davs to come, when the corpse of
a disastrous war roosts on the doorstep, they
will be far wider apart. Unless Andrew
Fisher builds the wall high and strong,
Australia will thus pay a considerable
amount of the Teutonic war indemnity, and
lose its manufacturing industries to boot.
A society has been formed to educate the
people to a wholesale boycott of German
goods. The trouble is that a boycott relies
for success on the earnestness of the indi-
vidual ; and the average citizen is usually
anything but earnest except at odd moments.
Also he is forgetful and more often indifferent.
But a heavy super tax is like the genii in
our blood —it works on silently all the
time, and toils hard in our interest while
we sleep. It is the boycott crystallised into
legislative enactment. Let us have it.
Building Covenants.
A recent decision of the English courts, in
which the London County Council got the
worst of things, has thrown grave doubts
upon the validity of the “building covenants”
by which buyers of suburban land are bound
to erect dwellings of a particular sort. The
idea of these agreements would seem to be
that the gent who wants a suburban cottage
with a stucco front, a plaster of Paris urn
and two dusty rose bushes is thereby pro-
tected from the bloke who might buy an
adjoining section and erect a bark humpy
with trimmings of discarded corn-sacks. Of
course, the covenant is no real protection.
To stipulate that buildings shall be of bricks
and tiles is nothing in the face of the awful
things that have been done in bricks and
tiles in almost every street. There are no
means by which the sanity of the architect
and the taste of the owner can be guaran-
teed. Material is no safeguard. A cottage
built of corrugated iron and timber might be
in excellent taste, while one faced with most
expensive slabs of marble might be a night-
mare. Sydney and Melbourne and Adelaide
all have model suburbs where little gim-
crack red and white cottages stand painfully
in rows. Those suburbs are the pride of the
landsalesman and the glory of the shopwalk-
ers who inhabit them; but judged by any
decent standards they are a disease and a
loathing. Yet the bricks are there all right,
and there can be no question about the
violent red of the tiles. They are the result
of a strict application of the building coven-
ant idea, and a convincing proof of its
failure. Now, however, that the law appears
to have said that the covenant doesn’t hold
to any great extent, we may look for a
change. Somebody will burst in with a soft
drinks shop or a produce store, and the
select street will escape from its awful
regularity to gradually fall into slum-like
decay and picturesque neglect; for it is
curious that the concrete urn begins to look
picturesque the moment it falls off its pedes-
tal. There is only one way in which the
builder of a suburban humpy or mansion
can be protected against the bad taste of his
neighbors—or the thing that in his opinion
is bad taste—and that is by securing a wider
frontage for his holding. No building
covenant can protect in the face of conges-
tion and narrow frontages. The present popu-
lation of Sydney ought to occupy practi-
cally all the space from the Hawkesbury
to George’s River and back pretty well to the
Nepean. If it were spread out in this fashion
there would be no need for talk of building
covenants or any other devise to save the
citizen from himself or his neighbors. The
bark humpy or the mansion of corn-sacks
wouldn’t matter in the least if it were well
beyond your own boundary. To create such
a city the requirements are roads —of which
at present there are practically none—fast
non-stop trains, a network of cheap trams,
a rating system under which you would pay
at least as much for a 20ft. frontage as for
one of 120 ft., and a huge extension of the
motor-’bus system. As there seems no reason-
able probability of getting any of these things
so far as Sydney is concerned, the hour
is nearing when the erection of any
new buildings in the County of Cumber-
land should be forbidden by law. The Mil-
lions Club would protest, but matters would
soon right themselves, and the Millions Club
could go away and hold a subdivision sale on
its well-known easy teims at Port Stephens
or Eden or Coff’s Harbor.
The Holman Government pawned about the
last of its Labor principles last week when
the Norton-Griffiths agreement was for-
mally signed. It is as amazing a piece of lunacy
as any Australian State was ever afflicted
with. The English middlemen don’t under-
take to find any specific sum of money what-
ever. All they agree to do is to assist in
underwriting certain loans—for a considera-
tion. This amounts to no service at all, since
the most.racketty Johnnie in Australia can
get his bills backed at a hundred places—for
a consideration. Further, these alleged capi-
talists, who don’t agree to put up any parti-
cular amount of capital, are also contractors
who don’t agree to carry out any contract
for any specific amount. They are to be
paid by commission, and if the work exceeds
their estimate they are to be paid a percentage
on the excess. In short, Australia is to raise
the money and the Norton-Griffiths mid-
dlemen are to spend it, and the more the
work costs the better it will be for Norton-
Griffitiis. N. S. Wales can supply one
illustration of a similar insane contract. The
Commonwealth Oil Corporation—a mad Eng-
lish co. —paid one of its officers a commission
on what was spent. Even Holman, though
he be one of the worst-informed men in the
world on practical affairs, probably knows
what happened to the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation.
The long series of gory battles in Poland
seems to be ending at last. Or at least the
British press cables, over which the Censor
hovers like a short-sighted guardian angel,
profess to see the end approaching through
smoke and mud. In particular, the Morn-
ing Post reckons that “the turning point on
the Russian side has now been reached,”
while the Daily News represefits llinden-
BHRG as “rushing army corps hither and
thither”—presumably in a last desperate
attempt to make the most of his remaining
men. It may be all true; still, it is worth
remembering that the hoorays of the care-
fully-supervised British press lately caused
the Russian General Staff to issue a warn-
ing. _ The unreasoning mannerf in which the
British papers have “surrounded” the far-
flung myriads of Hindenburg and sent the
Russians steam-rolling to Berlin, first
amazed the better-informed Russians and
then wearied them. They wondered why the
news-starved British journals couldn’t see
that the job was too big to be done in that
sudden way. If, they reasoned, the British,
French and Belgians could only progress by
yards when faced by one-third of the Ger-
man . army, how could they expect the
Russians to walk over the remaining two-
thirds of the Germans and three-fourths of
the Austrians? And when it became obvious
that the British papers, for some reason,
couldn’t measure the bigger row by the
smaller one just in front of them, the
Russian General Staff issued a warning—
really against the misleading policy of an
institution which has not managed to make
friends anywhere. At any rate, Russia has
been forced to officially label the British
press “Dangerous.” If that is the result of
the Censor’s exertions, what are the Censor’s
exertions worth?
From one of the best-known inter-State
manufacturers in Australia :
I do not know if you are aware that German
private-enterprise capitalists receive every encourage-
ment from the Government of the Fatherland, while
Australian private enterprisers are handicapped all
along the line by our Federal wire-pullers. Manu-
facturers here have goods, which they paid for last
June, in German steamers in Cape Town and else-
where. A business-like Federal Government would
have insisted upon the prompt delivery of these
goods, letting the lawyers argue its right to do so
afterwards. Having, however, placed the lawyers
in communication with the Navy, they have shown
these gentry a fine field of fees to work upon, and
owners of the goods must suffer inconvenience and
loss as the result of it. Times are bad enough here
now, our representatives know, but they do little
to help Australian industries. Where agents for
imported German goods are concerned, however, our
legislators appear to go out of their way to assist
them. I was recently shown a letter written by the
representative of a well-known Cologne firm, who
stated that the Federal (Australian) authorities
had given him permission to import his firm’s goods
from their New York factory, and that he would
shortly be able to fill all orders. While this privi-
lege is granted to agents for German goods, Austra-
lian manufacturers are asked to pay an increase in
duty upon Australian-made spirit which is required
in the preparation of similar goods. So we levy
high excise duties, in order that foreign articles,
made by cheap labor, may be sold here. Meanwhile
the Australian manufacturer spends his time fighting
the opposition favored by the Government, and just
how long he can continue I do not know.
The German who rose up in a theatre and
howled at the United States ambassador,
thereby giving the cue to the whole audience
to rise and do likewise, shows how much
popularity the United Shakes has gained in
Germany by President Wilson’s careful
rail-sitting. It is very hard for the mildest
rail-sitter to give satisfaction to both parties
—especially when both parties have a sus-
picion that he is only waiting like an eager
undertaker for the dollars of the corpse.
While there is still some shadow of doubt as
to which combatant is to be the corpse, the
unpopularity of the patient spectator isn’t
usually expressed in words by either princi-
pal. But when the row is finally settled the
confirmed waiter-on-events is made aware of
the hearty contempt of the victor and the
supernatural hatred of the vanquished. In
the present case, the President is at least
not kept in suspense. He is having the
fruits of his policy served up to him quick
and early.

From “The Old Soldier” :
Henry Lucy, writing to the S. M. Herald, mis-
takenly speaks of promotion from the ranks as a
novelty in the British army. The greatest of the
French rankers were before Napoleon, and promo-
tion from the ranks was quite a common thing in
Britain long before it was thought of in France. It
was adopted in France at the suggestion of Marie
Antoinette and as a popular measure, but on the
distinct understanding that the sergeants were never
to rise higher than lieutenants. The eternal desire
to get officers who would work was, of course, what
had induced the British War Office to take the step.
The trouble has been, not that the authorities would
not give commissions, but that sergeants would not
take them without the extra pay of adjutants or
quartermasters, or, latterly, of musketry-instructors
or riding-masters, for no one under the rank of cap-
tain could live on his pay. In the British army every
unmarried officer must be in mess, and all must sub-
scribe to certain funds. In the French army there is
no compulsory mess, and the Government provides for
regimental funds. If Britain means to do the fair
thing after this war it will have to do all that
France does, and also keep promotion flowing freely
by means of a system of liberal retiring allowances,
which will cost a great deal of money, but will save
the country from the reproach of making the officers
pay for the army.
Victorian timber-merchants and box-makers
have raised the price of fruit cases this
season to 10s. 6d. per dozen, and there is
much snorting in consequence. Of course,
there is no combine in the business, as any
case-manufacturer will tell you. It was only
a coincidence that all the makers elevated
the price at the same time from 7d. to
Most of the boxes turned out at the big Mel-
bourne timber-yards (and the bulk of them
come from there) are made up of odds and
ends of timber, sometimes as many as half a
dozen different kinds of wood being used in
one case. Australian hardwood is, however,
the best timber for the purpose, as it will
stand the most knocking about. Seeing, then,
that a lot of Vic. hardwood sawmills have
stopped or are working only half-time, what
is wrong with the Government taking posses-
sion of one or two, putting on some of the
unemployed wood-workers and cutting a few
thousand Government trees into a few
million cases, and selling them to the fruit
and vegetable growers at cost price? It
would be rank Socialism; but growers would
certainly get their boxes cheaper, and to
achieve that it is worth while swallowing the
tiger.
The latest Londoner to make a mild parsoni-
cal attack on the White Australia policy is
Dr. W. F. Adeney, who recently spent a
few months in the Commonwealth. He found
“some good Christian men who doubt Aus-
tralia’s right to appropriate so big a share
of God’s earth.” Then he went on to Java
and found “a country literally swarming
with children,” where men are paid fivepence
a day and women twopence. “Can Australia
keep white?” Adeney asks. But that,
though common enough, is a coward’s way
of putting it. Ought Australia to keep white,
or should it mix with a people whose stan-
dards of living can be judged by the fact that
men are paid fivepence and women twopence
a day? And, instead of merely asking if it
can keep its standards, isn’t Adeney game
to help it try?

Turkey, having come upon the story that it
took Israel 40 years to cross the wilderness,
is dispirited, and isn’t sure th..t it will in-
vade Egypt, after all. It had an idea that
when it reached the Canal it would be met
by a native Egyptian with the head of the
last British soldier in one hand and a bunch
of dates in the other; and the unpleasant
things that actually, were waiting were
a most unsatisfactory substitute. The
advance guard has therefore send word
back that the Indian and the Maorilander
and the Australian are no gentlemen; and
the Turk is understood to be sitting down at
a waterhole and thinking whether he ought
to meet them. Meanwhile the Australian
and Maoriland Expeditionaries are implor-
ing all the Pashas to get a move on, because
they have another little job to do in Europe.
As a matter of fact, the job waiting in
Europe is a big job. On the eastern field
the Russian is pounding away in the snow
and the slush, and the vast weight of his
numbers will bear the Gerhog down in time;
nevertheless, for the present the Gerhog
holds his positions. What he doesn’t hold
is his men, and to the Gerhog that means
•everything. Even if they should suffer
reverses the Allies need not worry
—they need only mourn the death of
brave men —so long as the Gerhog
loss is approximately equal; and gener-
ally it is far greater, owing to the Gerhog’s
massed formations. That Berlin paper had
a glimpse of this horrible truth when it
said that Germany knew how many troops
the Allies had sent —what it didn’t know
Avas how many they could still send. There
seems to be a more general Gerhog recogni-
tion of what Time is doing for Britain and
her Allies in another way. Vast Russia is
almost wholly self-contained; she can do
without imports of any consequence. Britain
still commands the sea, and can thus feed
not only herself but France and Belgium.
Germany, on the other hand, is not self-
contained and does not command the water-
ways of the world. Every day sees a crumb
less in her cupboard, an ingot less in her
metal works. To reduce Britain to her own
straits she must blockade Britain’s ports.
That is the meaning of the recent decision
that all British merchant shins would be
sunk on sivht, and that neutrals must stand
off the British coast. But the Gerhog Fleet
is still bottled up ; all the enemy, has loose
are a few raiding submarines —quite enough
to pick off a ship here and there, quite
enough to add to the Gerhog’s crimes against
civilisation and the rules of civilised war,
but utterly insufficient to interfere with the
flow of commerce.
When discharging a man who had com-
mitted a petty theft out of dire necessity,
Judge Wasley, of Victoria, threw another
brick at the present system of dealing with
temporarily submerged social derelicts. His
Honor said the man did not deserve severe
punishment, and had been already in gaol
long enough awaiting trial; yet if he were
discharged unconditionally he must almost
necessarily steal again in order to live.
There was no State fund that could be drawn
on to give him a start, which was a mistake,
because it would be cheaper for the Govern-
ment to keep men of that class out of gaol
than to have them convicted and then have
to keep them and their keepers as well.
Finally, a probation-officer offered to take
the case over, and that settled the matter
particularly in hand; but it didn’t settle
the underlying problem by many miles. Long
ago a Victorian Government established the
Leongatha labor colony, where men on the
rocks might go for a while; but as that con-
cern was lately offering work to Melbourne’s
unemployed at “3s. a week and their tucker”
—with no takers —it can hardly be held to
have solved the problem either.
It’s good to be in Australia sometimes,
anyhow. Commanding oihcer of training
camp to sentry found asleep: “If you were
in Egypt you’d be shot. As it is, you are
fined a shilling.” George Iteid, by the way,
only stayed in Egypt a few hours.
“Selex”: N.S-W. Health Minister Flowers
has been telling the Sydney newspapers,
apropos of his trouble with the B.M.A. over
the syohilis clinics, that he had not at any
time used the term “rich and poor.” “All
I have said is that I will not permit any
hospital to frighten people away with a sign,
as it were, of ‘only the poor need apply here.’ ”
This is exactly what is done, all the same.
Every letter of recommendation to the out-
patients’ department of Sydney Hospital
must state that the applicant is in “necessi-
tous circumstances.” The Minister, either
because of lack of courage or money or both,
has all alone: shown firm determination to
cling to the fiction that hospitals are chari-
ties. This attitude has always prevailed in
N.S.W., and the consequence is that unless
a man is absolutely “necessitous,” sickness
in his family may ruin him. There’s a lot
of trouble looming ahead in connection with
this matter, and it doesn’t look as if Flowers
has big enough hands for the job awaiting
him.

Niblomaniacs who thronged Sydney
Criterion on Saturday evening knew
exactly what to expect from “The Travelling
Salesman,” by James Forbes. The. name of
the dramatist doesn’t matter, since the
whole Niblo repertory consists of the same
play—with the delightful exception *of
“Seven Keys to Baldpate.” Fred Niblo,
they knew, would have a part in which he
had to make rapid and humorous love, to a
backblocks maiden, retrieve the maiden’s
chewing-gum factory or vacant allotment or
“pattent” from the rascally financier, and
save the maiden for himself. This time
Niblo is a drummer, stranded over Christmas
at a desolate railway junction with three
other “travelling salesmen” —a pathetic sight
even though whisky and poker are available.
As usual Niblo asks the girl—this time a
ticket-clerk —“Do you believe in love at first
sight?” and again the girl does. But the
villain causes the usual stage complications,
and, in order to carry the play into a fourth
act, she believes, on stage evidence, that Niblo
is a scoundrel. But tliat doesn’t worry the
audience much. It knows its Niblo. *
Commercial travellers are advised to avoid
the show: they won’t hear a single “new
one” for use on the road. However, they
might learn how poker is played, since
a demonstration of this game is given
—though why the five players should crowd
to three sides of the table, instead of one of
them occupying the vacant side, is known
only to the producer. And the dramatist
might be asked why, except to create some
amusing situations, four drummers should
be so anxious to conceal the fact from two
ladies that they actually drink whisky. But
the dialogue is brisk and humorously slangy.
As the drummer, Fred Niblo is almost the
whole show—which is all the Sydney public
requires in the way of an invitation. Marion
Marcus Clarke, as a kindly, commonplace,
and, occasionally, skittish widow, presents a
delightful piece of character-acting that sets
the seal upon this paper’s high appreciation
of her abilities. Sydney Stirling, as Niblo’s
rascally rival, acts with his usual sincerity
and with his usual mannerisms. The trio
of drummers, John de Lacey, Maurice Dud-
ley and E. L. Delaney, faithfully portray
cleverly differentiated traditional types of
this übiquitous profession. Fred Cambourne,
who has done many minor things and most
of them conscientiously, this time appears
as a nigger servant who gets his laughs in a
genuine and unobtrusive way. Among the
other characters Edwin Lester appears as a
delightful baggage clerk, and Enid Bennett
makes, a pretty but insignificant heroine.
“THE SIGN OF THE CROSS," AT
SYDNEY ROYAL.
Berenice (Irene Browne) wastes the “gad
eye ” on Marcus Superb us (Julius Knight).
“High .Jinks,” the newest J.G.W. musical
show, seems likely to have a long run at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Every press critic
has had a kind word to fling at it; and,
better still, the early customers are adver-
tising it gratis when the conversation flags
in the suburban drawing-rooms and all the
gramophone records have been played. That
is the sort, of ad. that is more grateful to
the theatrical manager than manna frpm the
skies.

preservation. But for a slight greyness about
the temples and a little more huskiness in
the voice, Julius might be the same radiant
Roman that conquered this country 20 years
ago. The religious melodrama itself has
lost its wonderful Bill Squires punch;
nevertheless on the opening night, the flagel-
lation of the reluctant Stephanus by a tall,
spindly soldier was still able to wring an
indignant “Oh, you brute!” from an
anguished woman in the gallery.
Lizette Parkes is a conspicuous success as
that study-in-still-life, Mercia. She looks so
much like a Sunday-school superintendent’s
whited ideal that one thoroughly sympathises
with the riotous pagans when they stream
out of the banqueting hall and try to cheer
her up with a perfectly respectable song
and dance. The careful and unobjectionable
stage revelry .of the pagans is offset by the
exaggerated gloom of the Early Christians
who refused to pay their taxes or get their
hair cut. In fact, the play, as produced, is
a fine apology for Early Paganism and the
severity of the intolerant Emperor. James
Hughes, as the shaky Nero, supplies an
admirable study of a tottering tyrant.
Eardley Turner (Glabrio) adds a humor-
ously wise drunk to his alcoholic collection;
Frank Harvey makes a picturesque Tigel-
linus ; and the consistent J. B. Atholwood
crawls and cringes in a natural manner as
the grimy informer Servilius. Irene Browne,
as Berenice, is in a part where it is expected
of her to sneer and lounge, and, needless to
say, she does it very gracefully. The fact
that Stephanus’s shapely legs are not spoilt
by her turn on the rack seems to be a
tribute to the skill and dexterity of the
official torturer.

The Adelphi (Sydney) gave up its prodi-
gal ways on Saturday last, and returned to
the straight and narrow path. In other
words, “The Babes in the Wood” were sent
on tour, and that familiar shocker, “The
Night Side of London,” was resuscitated.
Needless to say the house was packed. The
Jdelphi can always rely on a crowd when
there is an opportunity of seeing a poor,
lone girl dragged in the mud for 3£ acts
and then married to a beautiful hero in a
white suit in the last spasm. This paper
has no fault to find with the bellowdrama
as a bellowdrama; but it is after the man
who compiled the programme. For this:—
For every bad woman you can find a dozen bad
men. Ask yourself the question —Can a woman be
goodf
If echo answers “No!” things look bad for
man, with a 12 to one chance against him.
“The Nightie Side of London” introduces a
new cast, with Miss Gwen Dorise and
Ronald Conway as principal seconds for
Virtue, and Miss Muriel Dale and Rutland
Beckett in the opposite corner. The towel
will be thrown in to-morrow night. On
Saturday “£t Cripple Creek” will disturb the
calm of a usually peaceful neighborhood.
Rather than quarrel with the modest per-
son who has labelled Odiva’s Tivoli turn
“the most sensational act ever introduced,”
The Bulletin invites Sydney to see her
show- Incidentally, it may mention that
the turn is exceedingly damp and cool, that
the lady and her seals get Ljin. of pro-
gramme whereas the average turn gets
three-quarters of an inch, and that if any-
body disapproves of her it will be no use in
the world trying to drown her. Laura
Guerite, quick-change artist, connoisseur of
untidy hair, lady ragtimist and comedienne,
also threatens to do large things on behalf
of 11. D. Mclntosh. Dooley and Sayles, a
Yankee comedy couple, and Fields and Coco,
rag gymnasts, who would improve their turn
by cutting off the rag, are other strings
which are hauling money to the worthy
Scotch-Australian nobleman’s purse.

“Fighting the Flames” is still the star item
on the White City (Sydney) programme.
The burning of the skyscraper, the leaping
of nightied inmates from blazing windows,
and the arrival of the fire brigade are realis-
tic enough to rattle the nerves of an insur-
ance agent. Besides all the usual attrac-
tions a fireworks display is on the bill for to-
night (Thursday), and another carnival
corroboree is threatened for next week.

“Sunny Corner,” the new Australian
bloke-play at Melbourne King’s, has one
besetting sin which reduces its 19 faults
and failings to matters of minor importance.
The unfortunate comedy-drama is guilty of
dullness in the first degree. . When Templp
Harrison devised “The Winning Ticket” for
Anderson he showed a capacity for keeping
the audience awake; but in “Sunny Corner”
there is no joy of action, wealth of. incident
nor force of characterisation. Considered as
food for the popular intellect it is neither
“On Our Selection,” “Mrs. Wiggs,” nor good
red bellowdrama. It centres in an impos-
sible pub, built by a hairy Ben with a view
to supplying a visionary mining township
with beer; but the mines have still to
eventuate, and the pub’s only customers are
three drunks, presented as typical Austra-
lians. Author T. Harrison impersonates the
drunkest of the three, and whenever human
interest gets to its lowest ebb he falls off a
log and crawls away to sink another beer.
The two apologies for villains are a young
man from Sydney who shoots. Ben from
the rear, and his father, who is a mighty
mining magnate with a past. The magnate’s
past being known to Benjamin, that hairy
licensed victualler bounces the magnate into
putting up some stuff for mining purposes,
whereby “Sunny Corner” is supposed to
have found its belated future ere the curtain

young medico who comes to the. pub for a
holiday, and remains to adore Olive Wilton,
the explosively festive belle of the district.
She has grown up like a flower amidst the
prevailing bottles and bankruptcy. Like the
Belle of New York, she was simply created
for stage love, but incidentally she rejects
the matrimonial overtures of the johnnie
(G. Dawe) who shot Ben (J. 11. Nunn) in
the back. Vivian Edwards is the gloomy
magnate who buys silence with cheques for
large amounts; and Lillie Bryer, as a house-
keeper. is the weird, shrill voice of one cry-
ing “Dinner” in the wilderness. Cannam,
Vox, Franks, Temple Harrison aforesaid
and two ladies supply an assortment of
character sketches in which there is more
sketch than character. The ladies try to
make up in extravagance of mummery for
their lack of experience.

The ill-fated entertainment is in four
acts. Cutting and condensation will make
it less tedious, but the necessary opportu-
nities for dramatic effect are not there. On
the rare occasions when the pulse of the
comedy-drama beats fast, the. characters seem
unable to express their feelings by striking
attitudes and making a picture. Apparently
they have no feelings to express. The gallery
chaps betrayed more emotion on Saturday
night, with the result that the author, speak-
ing as an Australian to Australians, told
them they were a discredit to their, country.
That made matters about equal, since they
had signified much to the same effect regard-
ing Harrison’s play.

“Cinderella.” which has never lost its
financial punch, has reached the “last weeks”

Virginia complains, as before, of feeling very

Below the Cross
That marks his El Dorado.

“Married to the Wrong Man,” the old
Marlowdrama with the military flavor, is at
Melbourne Princess’s this week. .The
trouble commences with Captain Deering’s
drift into matrimony at the hoarse bidding
of his bottle-nosed parent, who professes to
have evidence of the gilded condition of the
bride. On finding proof to the contrary,
Deering treats his papa to bad language, and
sells his right, title and interest in the missus
to Private Jack Gladwin for fifteen pounds
sterling. After that the wicked officah appar-
ently gets mislaid and shot, thus leaving
Gladwin free to marry the girl and convert
his Conditional Purchase into Freehold. On
the wedding night, however, the grave gives
up its Deering, whereupon the twice-wedded
damsel is struck dumb with shock, and con-
tinues in a state of speechless bigamy almost
to the final curtain. Miss Pearl Smith is
cast for this painful character, and during
nearly two acts gives harrowing displays of
corked-up eloquence and boiling rage. The
scarlet-coated Gladwin, who buys a lot of
preliminary heartache with his 15 sovereigns,
is rendered by R. Inman with a soft, mushy
oratory that tastes like banana custard. R.
Bellairs is the sneering Deering, and the fer-
tile playwright always finds something dread-
ful for his hands to do. Ward Lyons as
Deering’s festive dad is raucous-voiced, and
Miss Jean Robertson appears as the color-
less Olive Manners, who decides to be gay
and blushes to find it shame. J. J. Ennis
is a grey-headed sergeant in Bob Inman’s
regiment, while others also belonging to the
Order of the Robin Red Breast include the
comic relief and two strenuous supers who
intermittently blow in, supported by patriotic
music and loud plaudits off stage, and try to
keep up the martial spirit of the piece. “Her
Forbidden Marriage” is the text for next
Saturday night’s discourse.

a fresh face in vaudeville, and Isabelle

disguises, and is well supported by the petite

toothed smile and much vivacity; but to this
commentator Wolf is merely one of the

girls is generally pleasing, and the burlesque
boxing item is a joke with nine laughs in it.

The War has cast our Stage into gloom.
—London dramatic review of 191 b.
I hear the actors foaming in the gloom ;
The limelight man for Europe has enlisted;
Like maddened ghosts that gibber in a tomb,
They curse the war, in language passion-twisted.
For that white beam that gave them life and vigor,
And made them swell was cut off with a snigger.
I hear some booming chest-notes; angry screams
Of darkened she-stars wake the playhouse murky;
Somewhere a diamond necklace brightly gleams;
The heavy father gobbles like a turkey.
The limelight man, while cold rain soaks and drenches,
Now lights much better actors in the trenches.
N.S.W. MONTAGUE BARNSTORMER, V.C.
“0.K.”: Lily Dampier’s death was a re-
minder of the long ago, when Alfred Dampier,
fondest of fathers, thought to run his daugh-
ter as a “brilliant young Australian actress,”
even as “Bill” Holloway had exploited his
step-daughter, Essie Jenyns. The successful
Miss Jenyns, having taken Mary Anderson
for her model, cultivated deep organ tones
and statuesque poses which came easy to
her. She had quick intelligence, a natur-
ally fine voice, a good ear for elocution, and
a tall, graceful figure. Moreover, she had a
pretty little headpiece; so taking one. con-
sideration with another, the success of “the
Australian Mary Anderson” was more easily
accounted for than the triumphs of the
American original in London a year or two
previously. But when Lily Dampier came
to imitate Essie Jenyns she could get no
further than the deep organ tones which her
model had borrowed from the Yankee lady.
She lacked the touch of genius of the
meteoric Essie, and in all physical respects
was rather heavier. Her voice, in particu-
lar, was a dull, monotonous contralto that
almost sang one to sleep. It should have
been toned up instead of being toned down.
Australia therefore resolutely refused to
accept Lily Dampier as a legitimate succes-
sor to Miss Jenyns, who had retired into
private life. Within his financial limitations
papa Dampier nevertheless strove bravely to
give his girl a chance. He presented her as
Rosalind, Portia, Ophelia and other famous
Shakspearian young persons, and she was a
highly-respectable Lady Macbeth in the sleep-
walking scene; but she never played to larger
or more enthusiastic audiences than when she
was a bellowdramatic heroine, on horseback,
in “Robbery Under Arms.”
Harry Plimmer and Winter Hall, who are
both Maorilanders, have mapped out a
scheme to augment the Patriotic Fund in
their own bit of the earth. They are getting
together a co. in Australia and are going to
tour the Shivery Islands, taking from
receipts bare working and travelling ex-
penses, and handing the balance over to the
Fund. An official treasurer is to be
appointed, and Premier Massey has thanked
the promoters and promised assistance.
Amongst the plays to be produced are “Lady
Windermere’s Fan” and “Peter’s Mother.”
Plimmer, who has been resting at St. Ivilda
(Vic.), expects to get together a first-class
team, although salaries will be on a low
scale.
“J.F.H.”: Australia’s recent
visitor, Matheson Lang, has scored
unmistakably with his Hotspur in
Tree’s “King Henry the Fourth”
at His Majesty’s here in London.
He threw his chief completely into
the shade. A. B. Walkley, the
Times critic, devotes half his
notice to a glowing eulogy of
Lang, and dismisses Tree at the
end with a couple of sentences.
The others all give unstinted praise
to Hotspur even if they don’t all
share Walkley’s poor opinion of
Falstaff. Tree, as usual, has taken
considerable liberties with his
author. He has split the play into
three acts and 16 scenes, and intro-
duced various bits of stage business
undreamt of by the better Bill.
But he has achieved a splendid
spectacular triumph which makes a
stirring dramatic appeal to the
martial fervor of the hour.
“Ami” : Alfred Dampier came into notice
as leading man in Manchester, filling the
position which had been held by Irving and
Neville, of “Ticket of Leave Man” fame.
He was likewise associated with manage-
ment in Guernsey, and had a letter from
Victor Hugo, complimenting him on “The
Yellow Passport,” a version of “Les Miser-
ables.” His wife was Miss Katherine Rus-
sell, who preserved her youth in a more
remarkable fashion than anybody save Nellie
Stewart. Really Mrs. Dampier looked
younger, in later years, than her daughter,
Lily, who had the misfortune, dreaded by
leading men as well as leading women, of
putting on weight. Mr. and Mrs. Dampier
came to Australia about 40 years ago,
engaged by Coppin. He opened at Mel-
bourne Royal as Mephistopheles. The
daughters Lily and Rose were then infants.
Lie returned with them as children in “The
Yellow Passport,” and delighted the audi-
ence immensely when he came before the
curtain leading Lily and carrying Rosey.
More years elapsed, and then he had a delu-
sion that he could travel Australia with
eight of Shakspeare’s plays, in which Lily
was Ophelia, Lady Macbeth, Desdomona,
Rosalind, Juliet, Viola, Portia and Beatrice.
The inevitable happened; he had to descend
to melodrama, with his superb technique
but deficient natural gifts. In private life,
after one false start, the result of a runaway
marriage at Eltharn, Lily married Alfred
Roker, professionally known as Rolfe, who
became Dampier’s indispensable right-hand
man. He had been one of the youngsters
educated by Holloway for the Essie Jenyns
co. Others were Atholwood, Greenaway,
Inman and Dick Stewart. All were ambi-
tious to be Romeo, but Essie’s mother
insisted on Holloway, who was only about
as good as Irving.
The Australasian Kinemapoem Film Co.
has got Auckland (M.L.) preening its
feathers. The co.’s scheme is to film and
screen suitable poems by local authors, as
well as to give a chance to bards like Shak-
speare and Mrs. ITemans. The promoter of
the project is an energetic gentleman named
Donald Cornwallis, and he is unreeling no
less than two films per week. Also, he has
formed an Auckland Cinema Dramatic
Society, with the object of “training ladies
and gentlemen with a talent for photo-play
acting.” Judging by the rush of clients,
Auckland suspects itself of being thoroughly
stocked with the goods required.

This was somewhere in

George Morgan, formerly of Branscombe’s
Dandies in Melbourne, who went to England
last year and has contrived to get engage-
ments, writes that he doesn’t wonder why
struggling mummers who have sampled Aus-
tralia are so anxious to get back there.
“H. 0.”: As many have observed, the
“intelligent brutality” of German civilisa-
tion is manifested in the Gerhog’s military
despotism, his treatment of horses, and so
on; but it seems to me that it is most mani-
fest in German music. What composer ever
treated his vocalists with such “intelligent
brutality” as did Wagner when he set therm
the task of making themselves heard above-
the orchestra in “Tristan and Isolde” and!
the “Ring” operas? Also, _ consider the-
brutal treatment of an audience which is;
kept in a theatre for five hours by huge,,
unwieldy music dramas like “Gotterdam-
merung” and “Siegfried.”
“J.F.H.” on the year’s drama in London :
Even Pinero’s new play has been held over by
George Alexander at St. James’s. That best illus-
trates the nervousness of managers. Henry Arthur
Jones has had nothing played here, but is rehearsing
a new piece in New York. Somerset Maughan
scored with “The Land of Promise,” which, in spite
of an unfavorable reception, had a long and profit-
able run. Granville Barker made a brave and
happily-successful experiment in his abbreviated
version of Thomas Hardy’s titanic play, “The
Dynasts.” That and “The Outcast” were perhaps
the most striking things of the year. Hitherto
Davies, the author of “The Outcast,” has been
associated with light comedies; he has now shown
his capacity to deal with vital problems. Edward
Knoblauch, the author of “Kismet,” also did some-
thing notable in his cinematographic play, “My
Lady’s Dress.” This broke entirely new ground.
John Galsworthy’s “The Mob,” and Stephen Phillips’s
“The Son of David,” were too much like literature,
and that was the fault also of Jerome’s “Great
Gamble” and Israel Zang well’s “Melting Pot.”
Finally, Bernard Shaw’s one play of the year,
“Pygmalion,” with its “bloody” adjective in the
mouth of Mrs. Pat Campbell, was a thing of no con-
sequence: it merely deepened the stamp of eccentric
which Shaw has chosen to put on himself.
The selection of a new Minister in N. S.
Wales has been postponed until after the
Castlereagh election, which takes place next
Saturday. The reason is that the choosing of
another Sydney representative to fill the
vacancy in the Ministry might prejudicially
affect the chances of the Labor candidate for
the Castlereagh; and as a Sydney man pro-
bably will be selected, the job has been held
over till danger is past. Of the 10 members
of the Ministry only two, Ashford and Hol-
man, sit for country electorates, excluding the
big mining centres, which have nothing in
common with the rural districts. What can
be expected but a policy of congestion and of
refusing to consider any other ports than
Sydney Harbor, when the only members of
the Cabinet who are in touch with the rural
parts of N. S. Wales are Holman, the fluent
young city barrister, and that enthusiastic
young lawn-tennis expert (who is understood
to be also “something in the pastoral line”),
William George Ashford?
“Callan Park” ends the trouble: —
It seems to me that the supreme value of the
surrender has not been sufficiently realised by my
brother tacticians in this war. According to Koch,
their best authority, the Germans are already short of
bread. There will be practically no meat in another
six months, and the potato supply, huge as it is,
will not feed 60,000,000 people for ever. This is
where the value of the surrender comes in. The
British Empire is full of able-bodied males who are
born surrenderers, and who have no intention of going
near the front. All our Peace Colonels belong to
this class; also, the youths who are joining ride-
clubs, not in the patriotic spirit of their elders, but
as a refuge from contempt on the one hand and
peril on the other; likewise hash-house bloods wno
won’t join the Australian forces because it would
mean associating with mere Australians, and who
don’t intend to enter the British army because it
would involve something else equally horrible. In
addition, there are unnumbered millions of non-war-
like niggers, simple children of nature who will go
anywhere and surrender to anyone for the price of a
handful of rice and a drop of water per diem. An
army of (say) five millions of these amiable crea-
tures, led by about 40 of our Peace Colonels, and
officered by youthful boarding-house habitues who
have shunned the war hitherto on the grounds of
sore feet, a tendency to warts, and so forth, would
embarrass Germany more than many bulldogs. .Imagine
their arrival at Ypres or in the Argonne. A
million snow-white pennons waving gaily in the
breeze. The same number of somewhat anxious faces
directed at the foe. . A stentorian yell of “We chuck
it! Don’t shoot! ” And Germany faced with the
job of supporting an army which has never done
any harder work than eat!
If this splendid corps is formed I shall be one of
the first to apply for a commission, and when my
various appliances are taken into consideration, I
shouldn’t be surprised if I got a brigade. First in
order of importance, come my white flags. They are
contained in a small satchel or pouch in the back of
the uniform jacket. Attached to each is a light,
expanding stick. At a pull from a string which runs
through a “quick release” buckle fastened to my
braces, the stick will extend to its full length behind
the head, with the flag flying plainly from the end
of it. If it is shot away, or hauled down by some
stickler for military etiquette or my own side, there
arc others available in its place. Another useful trifle
is the pocket gramophone. Many deaths occur, I feel
sure, owing to the victim’s inability—due to fear—-
to surrender in a sufficiently audible tone of voice.
My gramophone record is deafeningly loud. It con-
sists simply of a voice which says: “I yield ! Hoch
der Kaiser ! Deutschland fiber A lies ! Conspuez les
Anglais! A bas Joffre!” The instrument repeats
these phrases, roughly, 27 times to one wind—that is
to say, during a period of about four and a half
minutes. It should be sufficient. All else failing, I
have perfected an invention whereby at the crucial
moment my uniform and boots fall to the ground,
leaving me equipped with a complete running cos-
tume with a Red Cross on the small of the back.
I have not yet finally decided upon a motto for
this new army in the almost certain event of its
acceptance. For the present, I incline to that noble
sentiment attributed variously to Heine and Karls-
bad Saltz: “Better a Magdeburg concentration camp
however dry than a Belgian grave however wet.”

Paris and Tipperary and London and
Petrograd are not the only places it’s a long
way to. The great battle of Ypres, in
France, gives an idea of how far it is to
Berlin. On November 11 the struggle was
commenced by Sir Douglas Haig at Zonne-
beke; and although his army was small as
armies go nowadays, it contained the finest
fighting material and the best-trained lot of
men in the world. Also, it was splendidly
led by Haig and his officers and backed up
by superb organisation. The conflict raged
with fury until December 19. Then, when
the dust had cleared away and he got time
to take a deep breath, Haig found he had
reached Passchendaele, one mile along the
main road from Zonnebeke. It was the
most expensive and memorable mile in
history.

“Gentlemen of Ballarat,” said Mint sauce
Jones, when addressing his constituents on
a famous occasion—“ Gentlemen of Ballarat
and savages of Bungaree.” The name stuck
to the potato-farmers and seems to have
done them no good. Anyway, some Liberal
visitors from Ballarat were recently bom-
barded with empty beer bottles as they sat
in their car, and one of the bombs 311 st
missed the head of Mrs. Berry, a daughter-
in-law of the late Graham. During anothei
“argument” the same evening a Liberal
farmer named Bourke was knocked down,
and kicked in the face, and had six teeth
shifted. Thus famous old Bungaree still
struggles to live up to the reputation which
the lanky old humbug of a generation ago
gave it. # *
“Solomon Malaprop”: This is the time
for the great inventor, if any of the tribe
remain. Not the pottering inventor who
devises a gun which will shoot 2ft. further
than the previous gun, but the one with an
absolutely revolutionary machine. The need
of the moment is for an airship which will
go 10,000 ft. higher than any other airship,
and thus be immune from attack either by
guns or by its reptile contemporary of the
atmosphere. It must be bigger than any-
thing before it, and carry one shell weighing
at least 50,000 tons, and filled with such an
explosive as hasn’t been known before
partly melinite, partly the language that
John Robertson used to employ, and partly
the fate that befell Sodom and Gomorrah.
This event would only need to happen once.
The shell would be dropped on a clear day
from a height of 20,000 ft. or 30,000 ft. The
German who saw it coming would utter a
wild cry of “Iloch der Devil!” and then
vanish. The pace of the missile would be
terrific. The thud would be- unprecedented.
All the three duchies which Prussia took
from Denmark in the 60’s of last century
would fly up in the air. The free city of
Hamburg would fly up in the air. So would
Bremen and Lubeck. Neither the Kiel
Canal nor the German navy would ever be
heard of again. The allied armies would
then invade the stunned kingdom of Prussia
on its unprotected north coast and finish
everything in short order. The Baltic
entrance being blocked by debris, the sea
would rise and proceed to drown Russia and
Denmark, and the ruined German would be
compelled to pump it out as part of the
indemnity. The Kaiser would pump along
with the rest. I believe that one compara-
tively cheap bomb —as comparative cheap-
ness goes these days-—if it was dropped from
a sufficient height—as sufficient height goes
these days—through an atmosphere which
costs nothing, would not only end the war
in a week but would alter the face of Europe.
And in so doing it might alter the climate
of Europe and shift the future history of
the world on to a new basis. This is the
time when the big inventor is really wanted.
If the airship idea is impracticable, why
should not the Allies buy Denmark for cash,
and, using it as a basis, tunnel under the
Kiel Canal and the adjacent naval harbors,
and blow up the whole caboodle? Perhaps
the two ideas might be combined. If the
German fleet, as it flew up, met the record
bomb of all history coming down, I am
convinced that the spray of that fleet would
land as far away as Cairo.

Victoria’s police department, of which the
nominal head is John Murray, can be wide-
awake enough when it likes. The Depart-
ment buys and maintains the horses of
mounted constables, and as it takes a million-
aire to keep a horse nowadays, and will take
a billionaire to buy one presently, the chiefs
have begun to notify constables of a very
sensible decision that in future they must
use motor-bikes. They are to provide then-
own machines, and the Department will
allow £5 a year for upkeep. Five pounds a
year to run a motor-bike and allow for re-
pairs, wear and tear of tyres, etc., and depre-
ciation ! Surely five shillings was meant.
The dear old Marriage Tie that the Lib-
erals used to blither about in the not-so-long
ago is severed very casually by some people.
’Way back in ’94, one John McLachlan
married a lady in Queensland. They dwelt
together for 18 months, and then agreed to
cease their Double Bed Dialogues. They
were still peaceably parted when, in 1905,
McLachlan’s brother met him and told him
that his wife had divorced him by inserting
a brief ultimatum in a local paper to the
effect that, if John didn’t turn up within
three months, the undersigned _ intended to
marry again. John, having missed the ad-
vertisement and exceeded the time limit, re-
garded himself as a widower, and went his
way. Later, a young man told him that his
advertising wife was dead.. . John sighed
deeply, but made no inquiries. Maybe he
thought he was entitled to, the lady now
being a stranger to him. In March, 1914,
he met Alice Emma, and blithely went
through the same old ceremony of marriage
with her. Next thing this harmless
and trusting man, who steered his course
through life by rumor, was in the dry dock
at Darlinghurst on a charge of bigamy,
which is an absurd crime, anyhow. On find-
ing that nobody was really annoyed, and that
the second lady was a happy wife and
mother with a crowing baby, a sensible Judge
let John out of the cage with all possible
speed, after binding him over in a surety of
£SO to come up for sentence when called on.
But John will never be called upon if he can
break himself of the habit of believing every-
thing he is told at street corners. A lot of
the information that floats round street

Chief Secretary Bice, of South Aus., has
put in three weeks inspecting public insti-
tutions —mostly hospitals—in the eastern
States. “We are not doing nearly as much
here as they are over there,” he told inter-
viewers on his return. “We are going to
do a good deal more in the future.” The
places he most admired, and proposes to
borrow hints from, are Mount Park (Vic.),
Little Bay and Waterfall (N.S.W.), and
Goodna (Q.). Dr. Morris, S.A. Inspector-
General of Hospitals, is to visit these insti-
tutions and pick up details.

Australia’s first patriotic fund was raised
almost a century ago. On January 18, 181G,
the ship Fanny arrived from England, bring-
ing gazettes and newspapers announcing the
victory at Waterloo and the surrender of
Bonaparte. On January 20 Governor Mac-
quarie issued a Gazette Extraordinary
containing a proclamation and account of
the battle for public information, and he
directed William Gore, the Provost-Marshal,
to call a public meeting of citizens to raise
a fund for the relief and benefit of the fami-
lies of “our brave soldiers killed and
wounded.” The meeting was held in one of
the wards of the then-unfinished “rum” hos-
pital, on the site of the present Sydney Hos-
pital in Macquarie-street. The Provost-
Marshal was in the chair and every citizen
of note was present; loyal and patriotic reso-
lutions were passed, and a subscription list
was opened and headed by Macquarie with
£50. By the end of the month the Sydney
list reached £451 8s. 5M., the Hawkesbury
list £231'8s., and at Port Dalrymple, in Van
Diemen’s Land, they raised £151 15s. The
money was forwarded to England in specie
and Treasury bills by LI.M.S. Emu, which
sailed in March, and, by the way, took as a
passenger William Charles Wentworth, then
on the track to Cambridge.
RESPECTABILITY UBER ALLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Minister of Defence says strong action is to
be taken to deal with soldiers found drinking about
the city. The conduct of these men has given offence
to respectable citizens. They 'are unworthy of their
uniform, and will be weeded out.
’Tis true, the soldier boy should be
A very decent-living chap,
A pattern of propriety,
A clean and comely bloke to see,
And for a stronger drink than pap
No doubt he shouldn’t give a rap.
But ’tis a fact the soldier boy
Is often seen upon his ear;
He goes with ladies not too coy;
His misdemeanors much annoy
Those gentlemen who seem to fear
The ruthless German less than beer.
So that we may have comely nights
Good Mr. Pearce will make a fuss;
The man who doesn’t scorn delights
Is held unfit to win our fights.
War has unpleasant sides, but thus
They must not be brought home to us.
The little goodly men are right.
But standing on this cake of mud
Amazement fills me at the sight
Of citizens with terror white
To see the mild wine’s balmy flood
What time the world’s mad-drunk with blood !
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.

“Armes”: Now Bonar Law, leader of the
other great party in Britain, complains that
the details of the Battle of Ypres, rivalling
Borodino as the fiercest on record, and im-
measurably more extensive, have not been
given to the public, from an idea that they
would discourage recruiting, because of the
appalling slaughter. He contends that the
censors take a narrow-minded and un-British
view in supposing it politic to withhold
losses. Recruiting sergeants are confronted
by men who display the newspapers, and say,
“Why, the Germans are reduced to the old
men and boys!” Asquith, in excuse, says
he is restrained by the French view as to
communiques. Otherwise he would be freer.
On this it must be remarked that the com-
muniques too often amount to suggestion
of the false by suppression of the true. Yet
the truth comes out. An endeavor by some
members to get on with business in Parlia-
ment is met by Asquith’s stern refusal on the
ground that England is still in terrible
danger. This partly means that Antwerp
must be recovered. And we should have
been obliged to recover Calais, too, if the
British troops were no better than the Ger-
man, or, rather, if the British had put no
more heart into it than the Germans. It
was Waterloo on a tenfold scale. Welling-
ton’s squares held for eight hours against
Ney’s charges. At Ypres the holding had to
be for days. The Kaiser said, like Boney:
“How these English fight, but thev must give
way!” Must? Who says “must”?
THE VIRTUE OF
IGNORANCE.
G RANMA: “Dear me , you girls nowadays do
things we never dreamt of"
CISSY: “ Yes, aren’t we lucky to-think of
them?"
MEDIUM INSANITY.
WIFE ( sentimental): “ Egbert, what would you do if I were to die?”
EGBERT: “I should go mad, my dear.”
WIFE: "Would you marry again?”
EGBERT: “ Well, I don’t think I would go as mad as that.”
“Hamer”: I don’t know if the Unneces-
sary Commodities Commission is going to
consider the matter, but there was a riot
when our ninepenny feed-bin put up its
charge to lOd. People who go to places
where ninepenny meals are served mostly do
it because they don’t want to pay more than
9d., and they would
pay 6d. if they
could; and the
amount of indigna-
tion that was ex-
pressed over the
lOd. shows the
capacity for anger
that is possessed by
man, and in a way
explains the violence
of the Gerhog. Some
of the Germans who
took part in the bom-
bardment of defence-
less British towns, for
instance, may have
lived there once and
been ovei'charged a
ha’penny for a bloater.
The first I knew about
the trouble was when
a man at the cash-
desk demanded vio-
lently whether it was
possible for Such
Things to happen in
a British Community?
Otfier men called the
proprietor a robber
and the extra charge
an imposition and a
crime. The only man
who didn’t speak in a
loud voice was one
who suggested that,
as he had come in
with only 9d., and the
charge was 10d., he
had better owe the lot
and square it next
time. The dazed pro-
prietor—he was just
then busy on two
simultaneous arguments with a man
who waved an umbrella and another
who wanted to know what relation
he was to the German Emperor—
actually let him go, although it was fairly
obvious he didn’t mean any next time to
happen. Ever since, there has been a great
deal of emptiness about the food-bin, and
the waitresses are doing more waiting than
they have had time for since the last drought
happened and the usual loan-boom burst.
When a battleship clears for action every-
thing inflammable is thrown overboard.
Boats, bedding, tables, anything that can
possibly burn goes over the side. Yet every
ship that is smashed by gun fire is reported
as being in flames before the end. It was
so at Tsu-Shima; off Coronel the Good Hope
was seen to be on fire before she blew up ;
every German ship sunk off the Falklands
was burning furiously when she sank; and
men who were rescued from
the sinking Blucher declared
the ship to be a hell of
seething flame before the
torpedoes ended the agony.
The presumption is that the
frightful vibration of the
ship caused by the discharge
of heavy guns causes the
air to be filled with particles
of dust and oil fumes. Shells
bursting aboard generate
frightful heat; and mingled
dust and oil vapor catch
fire. The Blucher men say
they saw shells burst and
produce great haloes of
flame, while the compressed
air, striving to escape from
the force of the explosion,
roared and howled through
the smallest openings, and
twisted and bent steel
doors, and whirled men round
and round in their prisons.
and ground them, to death against steel
walls. Land fighting is bad enough, but a
German warship bombarded by British 13-
inch guns seems to be the most charming
place on earth to be out of.
* * * *
They’re not all patriotic only with their
mouth. For instance, the Nestle Co. pur-
sued one of its young men in the Expedi-
tionary Force now in Egypt with a letter
to say that in the hurried good-bye at
Sydney it had forgotten to mention that his
job would be at the old address on his
return. Meanwhile, full salary, irrespective
of military pay, would continue. And there
is a man who is or was a panjandrum of the
same co. and owned a thousand-pound motor-
car. He reckoned it wasn’t doing what it
ought to be doing so long as it only carted
him around Australia; so he sent it to a
body-builder’s to be turned into an ambu-
lance, and he proposes to offer it and himself
to the War Office when all is ready.
“Moana”: Maoriland once nearly captured
a Belgian community. In the early ’Bo’s
gay King Leopold conceived the idea of ex-
porting surplus population by annual drafts,
and accordingly sent a prominent business
man of Antwerp, Emil D’Haarven, to Maori-
land, charging him to investigate the pro-
spects for expatriated Belgians. Hercules
Robinson, Governor of Loan Land at that
time, was in favor of the scheme. The
Government of the day regarded it favor-
ably, and the Belgian emissary was handed
over to Edward Wakefield, a well-known
pressman at Timaru, who made a hobby of
plans of this kind. The two men drafted a
scheme, and together inspected many local-
ities in search of a suitable one for the
experiment. Eventually they decided upon
a tract of fertile land in the Hakataramea
Valley, and the Government consented to
this lump of country being handed over.
After spending a year in Maoriland D’Haar-
ven returned to Belgium to report to the
King. He was too late. Stanley had just per-
suaded the old man to devote all his surplus
cash and energy to the Congo Basin. So the
Belgian surplus was pushed out to the Congo
to earn dividends, and Maoriland just missed
some much needed settlers.

The immigration business has been inter-
rupted by the war; but the reports of a
recent case at Bathurst (N.S.W.) might
profitably engage the attention of a depart-
ment which must have a lot of time on its
hands. An immigrant of 22 was charged
with having robbed his farmer-boss of a
horse, saddle and bridle. The arresting con-
stable found the young stranger close by in
company with two horses (one stolen) and a
revolver. It isn’t stated what the young
man’s intentions were, but his equipment was
more like a bushranger’s than a dentist’s.
However, the bush constable persuaded him
to hand over the gun, and the Law took its
course. When, in due course, the farmer got
into the witness box, the fact was bared that
he was employing the youngster to clear
scrub at sixpence per acre! The amazed
police magistrate asked the tiller of the soil:
“Do you think that is a fair rate even for an
immigrant?” The tiller replied like a man:
“No.” Then the P.M.: “Did you ever hear
of anyone doing scrub-cutting at 6d. per
acre?” “No,” said the farmer. “Not even
a Chinaman?” “No.” The sixpence-an-acre
scrub-cutter was then formally committed for
trial, and the interesting proceedings termin-
ated. Now the Immigration Department:—-
which, as already stated, must have a lot of
spare time on its hands—might follow up the
case and make sure that the inexperienced
youngster is not turned into a very bad advt.
for the Department and Australia generally.
He may not have been a very valuable scrub-
cutter ; but it looks as if the hopelessness of
the contract he had entered into with his
extraordinary employer had persuaded him
that honest work in Australia was not worth
while. Well, it isn’t —when it is scrub-cut-
ting at sixpence an acre.
THE REPORT OF SEAMAN JONES.
"Now then, Jones, I want a report about this.
Who's yer pat?”
“Submarine XX7, sir. Shubmerged to the
(hie) periscope, sir.”
The experiment of billeting troops on the
civil population, recently carried out in
respect of 50 officers of the Light Horse
School of Instruction in the Liverpool
(N.S.W.) district, was the first of its kind
in Australian history. Billeting not being
compulsory in this country, the consent of
the proposed hosts had first to be obtained.
There wasn’t any trouble about this; in
fact, the people of both Campbelltown anc
Narellan, where the scheme was tried,
offered an enthusiastic welcome. In many
instances the Government allowance for
meals was declined, and this not always in
the most pretentious billets, either. From
every point of view the experiment was a
success.

The directors “regret that owing to the
increased cost of coal and other extra ex-
penditure they have not been able to make
sufficient provision for depreciation and
renewals of plant this half-year. They
regret also the necessity of recommending
a reduction in the rate of dividend on the
‘A’ and ‘B’ shares.” These are the shares
for which the standard dividend authorised
by the Act of 1912 is 10 p.c. The standard
price of gas fixed by the same law is 3s. 6d.
per 1000 ft. Up to the time the Act came
into force the co. had been charging 3s. 9d.
It gave the co. the right to exceed the stan-
dard charge by Id. for every J p.c. which
the dividend fell below 10 p.c. When the
co. paid 9 p.c. it accordingly put up the
price, to 3s. 10d., starting from August 28.
It was the co.’s bad luck that the war had
just started, and the Necessary Commodities
Commission promptly and prematurely
ordered the rate down again. This lasted
till November 14. For the past half-year
the 3s. 6d. rate thus ruled for 111 out of
184 days. , Had the present 3s. lOd. rate
ruled throughout the period the extra
revenue would have been about £23,000,
assuming that the extra price made no
difference in the consumption; and it isn’t
likely to make much. You can thus add (say)
£23.000 to the £52,696 in order to arrive at
the profit for the June-December half-year
under normal conditions with the charge
at the present 3s. lOd. This would give
(say) £75,500, which would be enough to
pay a 9 p.c. div. on “A” and “B” shares,
and the statutory 7 p.c. on “C’s,” and leave
£IO,OOO for reserves and additional writings-
off. The amount which the co. may put to
reserves is limited by law. The figure above-
mentioned would be about the limit. Pro-
vided that exes, don’t run up further, and
assuming that revenue is not affected by
bad times and the slightly higher price of
'gas, there seems, then, no reason why the
9 p.c. should not soon come again,
A point of much importance is ns to the
allowances for depreciation, etc. The direc-
tors say that the profits for the past half-
year were not sufficient to allow them to
write off enough. Let us compare the
amounts spent on repairs, etc., and struck
off profits to provide generally for deprecia-
tion :
Dec.,’l3, Dec.,’l4.
Repairs, etc., of plant.. . . £28,112 £24,360
Repairs of mains . . . . 17,360 22,533
Repairs of meters and stoves. , 22,200 13,389
Depreciation written off gross
profits .. . . .. 5,000 24,000
Total . . . . £72,672 £84,282
There was no apparent reason why the
directors should not have made very ample
allowances for depreciation as at December,
1913; anyway, things were then so good that
a 10 p.c. div. was paid for that half-year.
Yet the total amount charged against earn-
ings for the past half-year was much in
excess of that for the June-December half
of 1913. This suggests that the true net
profit for the past half-year was very little,
if any, less than the £52,696 shown in the
accounts, in spite of the directors’ remark
that they hadn’t been able to write off
enough. In other words, it doesn’t look as
though anything woith mentioning of the
increased profit to come from the higher
price of gas will be absorbed by providing
for extra depreciation. So, on present
figures, the 7 p.c. dividend looks quite a tem-
porary affair.
One other point. During the past six
months £278,763 has been spent on new
buildings, plant and mains, etc., and in the
previous six months £400,788. Practically
all this money has been provided by tem-
porary loans. Yet though such loans are
costly, the uncompleted works by which much
of the money is represented cannot have been
earning anything during a great part of the
time. Further, the cost of changing over
from old works and the abnormal cost of
operating new ones has been borne by the
recent two terms. The future will have the
benefit of these new works ; yet the interest
charge will probably be lighter, inasmuch
as the temporary loans have been by this
time almost wiped out by new 5 p.c. deben-
tures. Altogether, then, the. outlook seems
to this paper to be far better than the past
half-year’s accounts.

Again this paper takes its cover off to a co.
which pays £45,000 in dividends and puts by
as much as £64,538 although already its
reserves amount to £582,059. True, having
put its cover on again, this paper goes on to
remark that if the co. did anything else it
wouldn’t be doing strictly the proper thing;
nevertheless in a case like this lots of people
wouldn’t do it. The fact is the co. ought to
be, and evidently is, prepared to suffer tem-
porarily for its great success. Banks call
in more money from shareholders when
their business grows and they get more
deposits than the old capital can reasonably
carry. But insurance cos., once they get
over their teething, are much more profitable
things than banks, and with few exceptions
are expected to provide their own extra
capital. Whether they can do it rapidly
enough or not depends on (1) the modera-
tion of the directors in the matter of divi-
dends, and (2) the swiftness of the increase
of premiums and therefore of risks.
In the case of the New Zealand the busi-
ness has increased so fast that, though divi-
dends have been kept very reasonable, the
funds have never been quite as large as the
risks demanded. This shows the movement:

A co. with £450,000 of paid capital,
£1,050,000 of callable capital, and nearly
£600.000 of reserves is, of course, entitled to
the utmost confidence. Last year’s losses
were £435,397. The income in excess of
exes, was £544,859. Assuming that there
will be the same excess this current year
the co. will by the end of November have
£1,576,918 available to meet losses. That
is to say, it could this current year meet
losses 34 times greater than those of last
year without calling on the shareholders
for any capital. Nobody will therefore
worry about the payment of New Zealand
policies. Yet the table shows that the
capital and reserves are carrying a larger
risk than is generally regarded as a fair
thing ; and the proportion, even though it is
better now than it was, is still not as good
as the figures of the best English cos. The
moral of all of which is that shareholders
ought to be content to keep the dividends
down where they are for a good many years
to come.
There has been a shrinkage in the past
year’s premiums, but that needn’t be viewed
seriously:—

*General. fSan Francisco disaster.
The Australian drought, coupled with the
recent disarrangement of commerce, fully ex-
plains the shrinkage. In fact, the co. has
done most excellently to keep its figures up
so well. Really a more serious trouble so
far as these cos. are concerned is the rebel-
lion of the N. S. Wales and other manufac-
turers against the accident and workers’
compensation rates, and the launching of a
co-operative co. which has smashed the
tariff. The N.Z. Cos. got in early with acci-
dent business, buying out a friendly office
just on 10 years ago. It has been a gold
mine. But it seems to have got down to
tucker dirt now.
Interests and rents actually brought the
co. in more last year than it paid out in
divs. That, again, is a performance which
earns confidence. And, though the co. has
more in freeholds and mortgages (together,
£544,866) than The Bulletin cares for, the
bulk of the securities are gilt-edged—or
thereabouts. The qualification seems neces-
sary because in the £521,979 of “Govern-
ment securities and debentures” there are in-
cluded various small borough and gas co.
debentures. However, they are just as good
as many which a year ago looked 10 times
better. And we don’t complain either because
the Board has valued the investments at the
prices at which they stood prior to the out-
break of war. The important thing is that
the co. has over £200,000 in cash and agency
balances, and all its income is in cash, where-
fore it will not be compelled to realise any
of its securities unless it has infernal luck.

A shipping co. desiring to look less prosperous
than it really is can for a while hide the
facts by paying for all kinds of improve-
ments as though they were ordinary working
exes. Of course, since ships are not im-
mortal, such cos. must spend something. If
they don’t actually spend it in repairs and
renewals they must deduct the money from
profits and put it by to spend later on. And
ordinary repairs and renewals are not
sufficient either, because you can’t keep a
ship going for ever by patching it —you
must pay for anew one some day ; and since
you wore out the old one in earning revenue,
provision for buying anew one should be
made out of revenue, and the money put
aside for the purpose isn’t true profit. This,
then, is the thing that has to be investigated
in connection with every shipping co.’s
accounts: in addition to its declared profit,
what amount has been (1) spent on
repairs, (2) put by for future repairs, (3)
set aside for replacements? It may be too
much or too little, just as. the directors may
wish to show that the co. is doing worse or
better than it actually is. :
It isn’t always possible to ascertain any-
thing about the foregoing matter at all. But
it frequently, is possible to get an idea of
what a co. has done over a course of years.
As at December, 1904, steamers were valued
at £41,085 and freeholds and leaseholds at
£B3OO. Capital got in since then is £4335.
(Actually what happened was that some
interminable debenture holders swapped
their debt for half the face value in shares.)
To-day steamers are valued at £150,787 and
properties at £41,325. That shows an accu-
mulation of these non-liquid assets amount-
ing to £142,677. Moreover, whereas
10 years ago the assets other than steamers
and properties were less than the liabilities,
to-day they are £83,898 more than the
liabilities. This means that the co. has in
10 years paid for all new steamers and
bought over £30,000 worth of property and
plant, and has, moreover, improved its net
cash position by upwards of £BO.OOO.
Meantime a thumping dividend has been
paid, and actually no new capital has been
supplied by shareholders. It is a wonderful
record. That of the Sydney Ferries is dull
and drab by comparison.
The next table shows what the last two
terms have done :
Dec.,’l3. June,’l4. Dec.,’l4.
Assets other than steamers,

Liabilities .. . . . . 2,247 909 1,509
Surplus liquid assets. . £68,490 £78,188 £83,898
So in 12 months the co. has (1) paid its
dividend, (2) paid for current repairs and
renewals, and (3) put by £15,498, most of
it in hard cash. (The .co.’s hard cash
exceeds £80,000.) Whether the repairs
have been much or little we don’t know.
But anybody who knows the Manly ferries,
as well kept as any in the world, knows that
they haven’t been neglected.
The co. is in 500,000 shares of £1
authorised, of which 281,616 have been
issued and paid to 15s. There is thus plenty
of room for more watering.

The profit which some people in this line of
business make consists of what other people
in the same line of business waste. It seems
to be mostly a matter of close costing and
good buying. You’ll see a man with big
business ideas who will come a cropper here.
The trouble is he can’t sit down and go into
the petty detail that a business like this is
made of. There’s a man in Australia who
made an astonishing success of two big hotels
which had scarcely been a success at all
before his day. He didn’t know a thing
about running pubs, but he knew all about
keeping accounts. No doubt Sargents
people have ideas as well as method. If
they hadn’t they wouldn’t have reached out
till to-day they have close-on 40 branches in
Sydney. These have included during the
past 12 months the Sydney Railway Station
refreshment rooms, and there is such a nice
profit to be made there that the Department
has notoriously long coveted it for its own
treasury. The time will come when not
oaly this but all the other railway
refreshment places in N. S. Wales will be
taken over. Commissioner Johnson, coming
from England, where the railway cos. run
the rooms and often contiguous travellers’
hotels, wanted to do it while he was in
Australia.
Still, though Sargents must have got a
fine addition to profits from the Railway
lease, and though that can’t be depended on,
there are apparently no other branches simi-
larly situated. For all that, it is impossible
to regard either the profits or the capital of
the co. as being well assured. The profit is
assured in no business where management is
of such great importance. Sydney has seen
quite lately an instance of a co. which
started in this line under the most favorable
auspices and fell to pieces within a couple
of years when the management fell to pieces.
As to capital—well, this shows all the
assets: —
Goodwill . . . . . . £45,000
Freeholds .. .. 49,075
Leaseholds .. >, i 11,500
Furniture and plant ~ 55,200
Cash ~ ••» ~ 17,000
Stock and sundries •:, 16,200
Total .. ..£205,067
Deduct liabilities totalling £55,842> and you
have £149,225, of which goodwill-, leaseholds
and furniture and plant represent £121,790;
and those items wouldn’t have any large
value supposing anything bad happened to
the management. It is a wonderfully profit-
able business —so profitable that the 10 p.c.
div. could still be paid if the profit were only
half as great. But its risks have to be
remembered by investors.
Partly no doubt to provide an outlet for
profits without increasing the dividend beyond
10 p.c., and partly because, though not
urgently needed, extra capital wouldn’t be
a burden, the directors are offering 25,000
more shares to present holders at par. On
allotment ss. will be payable; then ss. at
intervals of three months or more, or 5 p.c.
will be allowed on payments made in advance
of calls.

This co. supplies electric light as well as
gas; but no energy is wasted in the electric
business. Its chief mission is evidently to
keep off competition. Being thus free from
outside interference, the co. some time ago
went to sleep. Then it woke with a start.
The auditors had refused to take the co.’s
valuation of its assets, particularly on the
electric light side. That was in 1903. The
long string of writings off is the result. As
the profits have been made and written off
they have been applied to wiping out liabili-
ties. But that job is about done now, as
this comparison will show :

Surplus assets .'. —■ • £ 759
A run of excellent seasons in the vast coun-
try behind Rockhampton, coupled with high
prices, has helped the co. out of its awkward
situation, for the gas hasn’t been turned
down low as often it would have been in
lean times. This is how sales have moved:
Gas—l9o9, £4766; 1914, £6766. Electric
light—l9o9, £624; 1914, £1332. And
Queensland can still look to the future cheer-
fully. Its sugar crop is finding a ready Aus-
tralian sale, and its meat is commanding an
eager market. But even assuming that bad
times struck the central part of the State,
there would need to be a big slump before
the present dividend would be endangered.

Mad Bill again, of course, complicated with
drought. The first-mentioned catastrophe
stopped the export of most Broken Hill ores,
which was no good for S. Australian trade,
and the other misfortune put the export of
wheat out of the question. The result is
that “wharf and other earnings”, fell away
from £8757 to £6214 in six months. And

“McNorth”: Mafulu, mentioned by
“Lagani-Namo” (B. 17/ 12/’l 4), is the farthest
inland mission station in Papua. It’s a little matter
of six days’ stroll from the sand beach, and the
tortuous road was constructed by the Mission of the
Sacred Heart. This road traverses some of the
wildest and roughest country in Papua, arc! is some-
thing of an engineering feat. Well-built rest-houses
are strewn along the track at intervals of a day’s
march. Dilava, 3800 ft. above the sea, and three
and a half days’ journey from it, is a sort of half-
way house. It is situated on the edge, of a shudder-
some precipice, amid a wealth of wildly'-beautiful
scenery. Mountains, gorges and chasms are jumbled
together like some gigantic slag-heap. It is in this
country that the plucky missionaries have estab-
lished stations. There’s a church bell at Dilava
weighing several hundredweights that puzzles me.
I want to know how it was got up from the coast.
Everything has to be carried by niggers; horse
traffic is out of the question. On Saturdays a horn
is blown at Dilava to intimate to the adjacent villages
that the following day is Sunday. Thereupon the nig.
who intends going to church collects bis camping-
gear and starts off. Our brown relations in those
regions, like most mountain tribes in Papua,
wear no clothes, so the missionaries give the women
dresses to wear while in church. Mafulu, the ter-
minus of the long road from the coast, is built on a
spur, from which rise Mount Albert Edward
(13,500 ft.), Mount St. Mary’s (12,000 ft.) and
Mount Yule (10,300 ft.). What was German Papua
is in the middle distance. Here, as at the other
stations, the buildings are the personal exertions
of the missionaries. They sawed the timber with
home-made, water-driven mills (the only imported
parts of the mills being the saws), built chuiches,
made roads, learnt native languages, explored the
country, and made themselves generally useful on
no wages, and, in many instances, a starvation diet.
They are a hardy, persevering lot, those members of
the Mission de La Sacre Coeur.
“Ibis”: After all, does it matter much
whether land is subsoiled or not? Some at Vanco
(N.S.W.) was torn up with a subsoiler tied to a
traction engine, and the tearing went 2ft. down
towards the seat of gravity. A year later a fence
had to be. built across the subsoiled block, and the
soil was then just as hard to chop out Ift. below the
surface as it was 3ft. below. This was the experi-
ence in every posthole. Most farmers like to
scratch up about 3in. for the virgin crop, and then
plough an inch deeper each season. The under soil
is thus gradually brought to the surface, where the
air can get at it and bring about the changes
which make it satisfying for plants. Young plants,
as a rule, will simply refuse, to chew the sour sub-
soil offered them; when they grow strong then-
roots can do all the breaking-up they need.
“Rimu” : As a firm believer in evolution
I cannot help seeing that the final lord and master
of this planet is likely to be the blackberry bramble.
True it is only a vegetable, but it has an astonishing
grip on the principles of
living. It is as fierce as
a Montenegrin, and as
ruthless as a German; it
multiplies by seeds, by
suckers and by cuttings;
it is as intelligent as
anything its own weight
and size, and for dogged
obstinacy, endu r i n g
pluck and low cunning
it beats the bulldog, fox-
terrier, dingo and all
other dogs. I recently
wrestled in prayer,
backed by a mattock
and otherwise, with a
patch of the herb, and
was knocked out in the
third round. I grubbed
it out and burned every
fragment I could find,
afterwards digging the
ground over and raking
it for particles of roots.
After the first warm rain
r counted and destroyed
78 blackberry plants,
and once more dug and
raked the ground. After
the second warm rain
the plants numbered 215. There are now about
2578, and the fruit crop promises to be very good,
thank you.
“Croson” : Mysterious fires on Australian
ships since the war started have set shipowners cogi-
tating. There have been outbreaks on the \\ illo-
chra, Bombala, Norfolk, Orteric, Wyandra and now
the Loongana. No certain cause could be assigned
in any case, and “alien enemies” are suspected.
And yet Listen ! A week ago, on a cool but
windy day, I was working in an isolated orchard
near Melbourne. There is only a shed on it, and
the owner's brother was the only person with me.
We were both at or near a -.clam in the N.W. cornet-
all the morning, and at noon he boiled a billy
there. Then we went 300yds. away to the shed, anti
then 50yds. further on under a double row of pines,
where we lunched. About 12.45 he said he smelt
snroke, and on investigating we found the top of a
very dry fence-post alight and burning nicely. Had
we not lunched just at that spot the pines must
certainly have gone—the garden is ringed with
them —and a lot of fruit trees would have been
ruined. He couldn't account for it; but, after a
while, I remembered knocking out the ashes of my
pipe on a post somewhere thereabouts as I cut across
a paddock on going to work, nearly five hours
before. Had the day been Saturday, when we
knocked off at noon, a bush fire would have started
somewhere between 3 and 6 p.m., and I would cer-
tainly never have suspected my early morning pipe
of having caused it.
“Flinderino”: While the giant clam is
fresh let me get to the front. Self and mate were
pulling a dinghy in shallow water near Fitzroy
Island (N.Q.), when we observed a great commo-
tion in the water. We drew up to the edge of the
churned circle, but for a few moments could see
nothing. Presently all was still, the foam cleared,
and, peering down, this is what we saw: A 10ft.
sea-lawyer had called upon Brother Clam to deliver
a subpoena or something, and had had the door
slammed on his nose. As it was no business of
ours, we passed on.

horse disease mentioned by “Paddy Melon (lb
28/l/’lo). The complaint is not confined to the
Diamantina country. History and symptoms cer-
tainlv vary somewhat in the different States. Never-
theless they correspond very closely throughout—-so
much so that the “walkabout” disease of the Northern
Territory, the Kimberley disease of Westraiia
and the Birdsville disease of Queensland have been
identified as one and the same. Moreover, it is said
by experts that these diseases are allied to what is
known as the “Winton” ailment of Maonland, and
to another in North America. The symptoms in
the Territory and Kimberley take the form of a desne
to travel, hence the name “walkabout.” In Kim-
berley I lost seven prads out of 20, some dying in
a few hours in much agony, while others lingem
for days An examination of one animal showed
the intestines to be perforated by an insect and the
liver much diseased. As soon as a beast is attacked
it becomes groggy on the legs, sad lies down, seem-
ingly in great pain. Post-mortems led the experts to
believe that the disease is due to perforation of the
intestinal tract by parasites taken in with fodder,
la West Kimberley the annual loss is about 50 per
cent. I was staying at one station where horses
used' to die five or six a day, just before the wet
season, in November. The disease is most prevalent
in what is known as hungry country. In the Terri-
tory it is particularly common about the Liimnen
River. One owner up there lost 300 horses. In
Kimberlev it is most prevalent on the Fitzroy River
and the Leopold Ranges, and is at its worst between
September and December. There is no cure.
“Mrs. Lance Lawson”: Few people ever
knew the true inwardness of the thick mat of hair
on top of their heads worn by some of the Kanaka
women. I was once cutting the wool of one of
my house-women, under severe protest, when I cairn
upon a unique collection of what appeared to be dried
leaves and short twigs neatly bound together with
hair. In all there were five of these small bundles.
The girl was a new-chum then, and could speak
only a few words of English, but, as I gathered that
she set great store by these bits of leaves and sticks,
I returned them to her. Later, we discovered thai
each of those small bundles contained a lingeiing
death to at least a dozen enemies. For Nar was a
medicine- or poison-woman, as we had good reason
to suspect some months later, when one of the
Magnolia plantation boys, two of our own (Kirk-
eubbin) boys, and one boy from each of two other
plantations,' all of one family or tribe, became ill
and died, after a few days of illness resembling
phthisis, or acute consumption. Post-mortems con-
ducted by two doctors showed the conditions to be
the same in each case, viz., a fibrous state of the
lungs which eventually choked the patients. Having
learned that these boys were avowedly Nar’s enemies
I questioned her, but she was not taking am lisks.
All she would say was: “Very good him die; he
belong man Bush,” meaning that they belonged to
an inland tribe. Nar was a particularly handsome
Tanna woman, standing 6ft. lin. on her bare soles.
Also, she was the best house-woman 1 ever had and
the most faithful.
“Spraggs” The gayest thing I’ve seen in
snakes was a yellow fellow near Heyfield, in Gipps-
land. He was the exact color of newly-made mus-
tard, and of fair size. I never saw one like him
before, and unless I can have him verified I’ll have
to reluctantly get back to a lemonade diet.

“J.F.H.”: The Australian bush mission-
ary has been having an innings in the London
papers. One of them prints three columns about
him, all from the pen of the Rev. Dr. Jones. 1 hat
hurried tourist describes the bush missionary as
having' < la big’ slice of .the. hero„ in him, ,11 nd t com
pares him to . St. Paul in the matter of perils and
journevings. ,Among the perils .the worst but ..one
seenis "to be that lie has to : eat his ,owq- cooking.
BOTH RIGHT.
OFFICER (suddenly desiring to test knowledge
of very raw recruit): “Eyes right!"
RAW RECRUIT (misunderstanding): “So’s I,
sur."
The very worst is that he has .to “face the jeers- and
opposition of evil men.” Which simply shows that
Jones doesn't know the first thing about the Aus-
tralian bushman. “I take off my hat to the Aus-
tralian bush missionary,” says this unctuous parson,
and doesn’t know that the same bush missionary
takes off his hat to the great-hearted bushman.
THE SPOILING SHADOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While the stars were in the skies,
■ Paling at the peep of (lay,
Someone said: “’Tis time to rise—
Up, and let. us on our way.
“Ease is sweet, but meat and bread
Not by ease, you know, are won.”
And we rose and breakfasted,
Ere the day had well begun.
Then we mounted —pipes alight—
Gathering in our bridles’ slack ;
And the East grew sudden bright
As we galloped down the track.
God above! How fine it was
Thus in silence pushing on,
While the salt-bush and the grass,
Set with jewelled dewdrops shone.
In the wholesome, thrilling air
Of that spacious, central plain,
Little space there seemed for Care,
Little housing-room for Pain.
There, instead, glowed golden hope.
Freedom, graced in all her charms,
And a world of ample scope
For a giant spread of arms.
Yet, while soul and body basked
In that bright and golden glow,
Fell a Shadow —and we asked:
“What is this that pains us so?”
Then the dark came rushing back,
Though the dawn seemed rosy red.
Toil upon Hint joyous track
Pointed to our daily bread.

Tooth Paste.
“I simply can’t account for this
trouble with my teeth —and I’ve
been so particular to keep them
immaculately clean always.” This
is the complaint of thousands.
It’s just this way, Madam.
You’ve spent your time watching
the highwaymen robbers of tooth-
health—Decay Germs —and for-
got all about their sly, insidious
accomplice, “Acid Mouth.” Acids
are constantly forming in the
mouth. They are constantly
“working.” But they work
“incognito.”
And here lies the danger.
These mouth-acids, unmolested,
unsuspected, gradually dissolve,
and break down the enamel. The
tooth then becomes easy prey to
decay germs.
Look out for “acid mouth,”
that filcher and falcon of healthy
tooth life. Pebeco Tooth Paste
users have a good chance to keep
their teeth for life.

Mouth.

“Wandi” : The pioneer women on northern
farms and selections could tell many a laughable
tale of their early experiences with a gun. The men
were much away from home, and, in their absence,
many occasions arose when it was necessary for the
women to arm themselves. The blacks were gener-
ally cheeky, and hard to get rid of if there were
no men about ; but a little demonstration with the
“shooting stick” altered their demeanor. It wasn’t
necessary for a woman to threaten them ; all she
had to do was to shoot a hawk or a crow in their
presence, or show them how she could hit a small
tree, and thereafter she was safe. But the use of
the gun was principally for protection against bird
and animal pests. A man would usually teach his
wife first to load and fire light blank charges, mainly
to frighten parrots and cockatoos from the crops and
crows and hawks from the poultry run. Gradually she
became accustomed to the weapon, and by degrees
learned to shoot well. A woman on the Orara River,
who had received no instruction at all, one day, when
alone, was horrified to discover a big snake stretched
along between the ridge-pole and the capping of her
house. She tried at first to poke it out with a
clotlies-prop, but could not get at it; and as it
shifted along the ridge she dreaded that it would
slide down and get under the floor, when she would
be terrified with the thoughts of it all night. Look-
ing about, her eye lit on the gun—a heavy, double-
barrelled muzzle-loader—banging on the wall. She
took it down and loaded it in the way she had seen
her husband do. Then, tremblingly, she held it
under her arm, and pointing it towards the roof,
shut her eyes and fired. When the smoke had
cleared away and she had got her breath back, she
looked eagerly for the result. The snake had not
moved, and there wasn’t the mark of a shot any-
where. This puzzled her. She was sure she could
not have missed the house, for the door was shut,
and she had stood near the centre of the room with
the windows directly behind her. However, she
loaded again, with a heavier charge, and this time
she put the gun to her shoulder. She aimed rs
carefully as her shaking hands would permit, then
shut her eyes tight and pulled the trigger. There
followed a thunderous report, a frantic scream, and
a heavy fall, mingled with the noise of breaking
glass. She had held the gun loosely, and with the
heavy charge of shot she had put in it the “kick”
had knocked her backwards. The snake, however,
was as complete as usual. However, she triumphed
in the end ; the snake slid down the wall outside,
when she dispatched it with a handy waddy. It
was only after her husband’s return, when he found
a charge of shot in one of the barrels, that the
mystery of her first effort as explained. She had
put the powder in one barrel and the shot in the
other.

“Bouragi” : The natives of Rossel Island,
off the coast of Papua, have a pleasant variant on
the custom of suttee, ascribed (B. 14/1/’l5) to New
Hebrideans and others. When a married man dies
■he is laid out under his house and covered with a
pile of mats. His best-beloved spouse has then to
creep under the mats and lie beside the corpse for
14 days. She is fed at intervals, but should she
abandon her place, or, indeed, show any signs of dis-
pleasure thereat, she is considered to be lacking in
true wifely feeling, and is ill-used, and finally
smothered. Execution is by smothering owing to
the fact that the tender-hearted Rossel Islanders
avoid the shedding of blood.
HEADLIGHTS.
THE SUNDOWNER: “Well, I’ve seen some
meteors in my time, but never one going
backwards before."
“A.M.H.” : Apart from his dreadful lank-
ness Mulga Mac’s sole claim to distinction was that
he was covered with freckles the size of threepenny-
bits. He and his mate had been arguing things in
their .camp under the mullock-dump. The mate got
tired first. “Oh, bung up, Mac,” lie said, “veh
lanky cow! Yeh couldn’t even hold together if yeh
wuzn’t copper-riveted.”
A BAD BREAK.
THE MEENISTER (colliding, with McTavish in the bottle entrance): “ Man, McTavish,
I'm surprised at ye. Do ye no ken ye've broken the Sawbath as wee[?] breakin'
the law? "
McTAVISH: “Damn it, man, ye've done far worse yersel ', YE’VE BROKEN THE BOTTLE."
“Rag”: Between Quartz Hill and the
Einasleigh (N.Q.), during the wet season, there’s a
five-mile stretch of chocolate soil and “pudding-
stone” boulders that would “bog a duck.” In hurry-
ing to the Oaks rush a few years back I had the
boots sucked clean off my feet. They’re there yet..
Wherever a step was taken, and unless on to a boul-
der, down one sank to the knee. After three hours’
floundering I reached three bogged-to-the-axle jinkers.
Each had a five-ton-load and the teamsters and 45
horses hadn’t been able to pull one of them out of
the mess after a fortnight’s hard swearing. When 1
arrived they were trying to skid one of the jinkers
over some “corduroy” they’d laid. It was a sight
for the gods and devils to see them, as, wearing
naught but a flannel and a whip,' they strove to
curse those caravans ahead. They got out a fort-
night later. At a store on the edge of the awfulness
there were half a dozen ancient battlers who made
a precarious living by piloting teams or pedestrians
across. If the boss of the teams I saw bogged had
sprung a few bob to one of these derelicts his outfit
wouldn’t have been in the soup.
* * * *
“Pick”: Here are the answers to
“W.S.N.’s” queries (B. 28/l/’l5) about the fresh-
water crayfish. (1) To cook him drop him alive
into boiling - water and forget him until he is lob-
ster red. (2) Grays live on water insects, worms
and soft-shell relatives as a usual thing; but when
a dead sheep or rabbit navigates their way a public
holiday is proclaimed. (3) The “insects” on their
coat are just the usual old encumbrances. (4)
Yabbying is done with a chunk of meat at the end
of a line, but a surer way of securing a feed is to
glove your hand and grope in his nibs’s burrow. A
kid glove is best if there is one in the camp.
“Chutah” : The inland lagoons of Victoria
are densely crowded with wildfowl owing to drought
conditions. In some places it is impossible for the
gathered flocks to all swim in the pools at the same
time, and they have to take their turn ; so pelicans
and dab chicks fraternise, and the lordly black swan
takes her brood to the bath when the canaille are
out of the way. Fish are dying in myriads in the
shallows of the lakes and billabongs. But fish breed
quickly. The feathered legion have much more to
contend with, and it was a wise move to declare
all-the-year-through a close season. One species of
vandal multiplies and grows fat despite the leanness
apparent everywhere, and that is the starling.
Immense flocks forage the earth in search of pro-
vender, and get it —generally at the expense of the
orchardist.
THE OPTIMIST.
THE CHEERFUL ONE: “ Well, there's one
thing I will say fer these muddy roads,
they does ’ide the ’oles in yer boots."
“J. 0.8.”: By order of the N. S. Wales
Govt, all larks, foreign and native, are now protected
until June 30, 1924. Altogether, 112 species of
birds are now more or less safe until that date.
The seagull is amongst them, and (this for the bush-
man’s information) so are the bustard, scrub turkey,
wonga pigeon, ibis, robin family, lyre-bird and king-
fisher. Others have protection for certain seasons.
They include pheasant, grouse, partridge, nightin-
gale and emu. There should be far more protection
of our bird-life than there is, but Ma deserves a
good word for so much as she has provided.
“Te Babarantiko”: The worst thunder-
storms do not occur in the Tropics, or (say) within
the Equatorial Belt (lOdeg. S. to 1 Odeg'. N. Lat.).
There the storms rage usually in the westerly, south-
westerly, or north-westerly season, according to
locality. Around the Southern Hemisphere, talcing
in the southern Halt' of Australia, portion of South
America, from (say) 23deg. to 40deg. of lat., and
varying on East and West Coasts, and all South
Africa from north of Delagoa Bay, runs a belt sub-
ject to electrical disturbances for violence and fre-
quency unparalleled. Incidentally, the winds in the
same belt, and south of it, blow with much greater
continuous violence than in the corresponding area
in the Northern Hemisphere. I have seen the break-
ing of the South-West monsoon in India, on land
as well as in the Indian Ocean north of the Line,
and an awe-inspiring spectacle it was. But not
more so than the electrical storms that crash
upon Sydney once every year or so. Of
such disturbances sampled during a sinful life
one stands out with great vividness. Some
120 miles off the mouth of Rio do la Plata (Argen-
tine), in the pampero season, I was on a cranky
steel clipper, in ballast from Rio de Janeiro around
the Horn to Iquique, under lowered topsails; wind
north, blowing gently over the starboard quarter.
In the afternoon immense volumes of intensely
black clouds, like smoke from bad Japanese coal,
and not much higher aloft than our trucks, began
to roll up from right ahead (S.S.W.), travelling at
immense speed. Almost immediately after dark the
fireworks began, .and all night, with very brief
spells, the lightning played with indescribable bril-
liance. Yet there was never a murmur of thunder.
With the dawn the lightning vanished, leaving a
grey day, with black cloud-masses hurrying up from
S.S.W., and the wind still blowing quietly from the
north; but, again, at sunset, the streams of light-
ning reappeared and flooded the night. Next day
saw tlie curijjus clouds skimming with hurricane
speed against the wind, which was blowing to us,
and the northerly freshened into a roaring sailing
breeze. I never heard what occurred to the west of
us, but have a pretty good notion.
"Billy Ballyooly”: For years 1 was
treasurer of the Amalgamated Out-o’-Works Association
of Australia (South-Western Branch). A while back,
however, when our president was fined ss. for setting’
fire to a haystack, we had to sell off the office furni-
ture to prevent him being thrown into gaol and
thereby disgracing the A.O.W.A. of A. The result
is I am now on tour collecting the names of the
various tanks at which I fill my billy. Here are
some of them: Brass Knocker, Stintin’ Tank, Dingo
Tank, Charcoal, Dead Man’s, Native Dog, Magpie,
Grecian Bend, Good Friday, Thirty Seven, Squeaky
Jack’s, The Pothole, Teller Tank, Pinnacle, Billy’s
Lookout, White Elephant, Pig Tank, Scrubby, Lost
lank, Thick’s, Clump Yard, Piccaninny, Hit or Miss,
Trottin’ Cob, Paradise and Horse Shoe. They're all
within easy crow-fly of the Lachlan.
“Bill Bowyang”: I’m willing to bet my
quarterly remittance that the aboriginal can knock
records off any other dusky race on this globe,
American redskins included, so far as handling a
canoe is concerned. I quote this incident that
occurred in Whitsunday Passage (N.Q.) some years
back, as a guarantee of good faith. The proprietor
of the sawmill on Whitsunday Island ran short of
meat, and sent two aboriginals in a bark canoe to
Molle Island to procure supplies—distance between
ihe two islands about 12 miles. On their arrival
at Molle the blacks obtained a large bag of meat
and a bag of salt, and set out again for home. In
the middle of the passage the canoe capsized. The
bag of salt was lost, of course, but not so the beef.
In some way one of the abos. managed to keep it
afloat while his companion baled and righted the
craft. Then they proceeded on their way. I have
admired Black Brother’s wonderful work in a canoe
whilst a cyclone was raging, and to see him fastened
to a harpooned turtle is a hair-raising experience.
A small craft handled by anyone else on such an
occasion would be swamped in a few seconds, and the
language of the old shellback towing it round for
the rest of his life would be a marine scandal.
GOOD ADVICE.

“Now don’t you be a blanky fool!’’
The white-haired veteran said.
“Don’t lose your blanky nut! Keep cool! 1 ’
The youngster bowed his head,
And in a tone, respectful, low,
Remarked: “That’s right—you orter know!”
“By blank, I do!” the old man said;
“There’s not a blanky point
That them there blanks” (His language bled
At ev’ry hinge and joint)
“Can teach this poor old blanker! So
You bet your blanky life, I know !
“If there’s a blanky thing goes wrong,
You blank well come to me!
Them blankers won’t hold you up long,
For into blankery
I’ll knock them all in one blanked swipe—
The blanky blanks! ” He lit his pipe.
The young man, comforted, elate,
Gave thanks unto the sage.
What guide so wise, so good, so great—
The marvel of the age?
For words of cheer he rendered thanks,
And never thought about the blanks.

It might be fear of the Gas Act, or perhaps
it was plain philanthropy ; whatever it was,
during the half-year a reduction was made
in the price of gas. Meanwhile, the Aus-
tralian (Sydney) Cos., which is infinitely
better placed, is complaining about
increased costs, and has pushed its price up.
In spite of the Albury Co.’s reduction, gas
sales have moved in this fashion: June-
December. 1913, £2221 ; June-December,
1914, £2329. The one doubtful spot in the
co.’s accounts is “mortgage £3005.” How-
ever, things might be worse, for a few years
back it was £SOOO. This 10-year comparison
further reports progress :
1904. 1913. 1914.
Liabilities .. ..£5148 £4025 £3259
Liquid assets .. .. 1146 3115 2'3/2
Excess liabilities.. £4002 £9lO ’£BB7
So the co. has in 10 years not only paid a
regular 10 p.c. dividend (in other words,
paid dividends totalling the whole capital)
and presumably made necessary repairs and
renewals, besides adding considerably to its
mains and plant, but it has also improved
its financial position by £3115. And its paid
capital is only £7500. After that no one
can call the directors unreasonable for
throwing the customers a morsel.
Barnet Glass pays an interim div. of 8 p.c.
all round.

Manager Creer, of the Adelaide Steam
Tug Cos., in defence, or, anyway, in extenua-
tion :—•
After stating the S<s resulting from our opera-
tions for last half-year, Tits Bulletin remarks:
“Feelings of sympathy evaporate when one. . . .
reaches this: ‘Arrangements have been made in
England for the building of anew tug.’ ” I cannot
complain of anything unfair, because the bald state-
ment of our intention to purchase a tug in England
would, on the face of it, imply that the claims of
Australian builders had been ignored. Such, how-
ever, is not the case. When the decision to build
a tug was reached, a specification outlining our
requirements was prepared, and submitted, inter-alia,
to two of the leading builders of these vessels in
Australia. One of them replied: “Cannot quote, ’
the other stated that their yards were so full that
they could not consider the matter then, but as soon
as possible they would give us a quotation. It was
not till five months after our inquiry that we re-
ceived a price. This' clearly shows a desire on
our part not “to rob Australia of its return job. ’
To render our position still clearer, it must be ex-
plained that the Commonwealth Government imposed
a duty of 25 p.c. on vessels of this description under
500 tons gross measurement imported here from
England, and as the tug in question comes under
this category it will mean a contribution to revenue
of approximately £3500. Naturally our desire was
to avoid this, and have the tug built here, but when
offers were considered it was found that the Aus-
tralian firm wanted more to build the vessel locally
than it would cost to build in England, deliver here
and pay the duty. Under these circumstances it is
not to be wondered at that our decision was to build
in England, and we consider that as Australia will
benefit to the tune of about £3500 we are entitled
to that sympathy which you refuse. This explana-
tion also refutes the statement that “Australia
wasn’t allowed to build the tug.” I must also state
that the order was placed in England before the
outbreak of hostilities, and consequently Australia’s
need was not then so apparent.
The Bulletin, in reply, merely draws the
Minister’s attention to the fact thus proven
that a 25 p.c. duty is not sufficient for its
purpose.
Helped along hy the spelter market, which
has touched the record price of £4O, B. H.
Prop. 6 p.c. debentures have gone back to
par—a recovery of no less than £l2 since
the dark days of the German rush on Paris.
Though this is an unusual recovery, prac-
tically every stock, both mining and invest-
meat, has put on something; and the
market is still on the up-grade.
* * * *
Butler’s Tin (N.S.W.) is sar; 'ne enough
to talk about dividends from 1 p.c. ore.
With the market at £l5O. 1 p.c. ere, suppos-
ing metal and not oxide is me:., t. is worth
30s. per ton, and all mining, milling and
smelting costs would have to be paid out of
that. There are estimated 1 >■ be 40,000
tons of ore. This contains 1- 0 tons of
pure tin if the assay averages 24 p.c., as
alleged, and 400 tons if the act; : 1 extraction
is 1 p.c. There can’t be anyth' j fat in it,
anyway.
Lloyd’s Copper, Burraga (K.3.W.), has
got further exemption for < ne month.
Armstrong, the late manager, lias gone to
Papua.
The Very Wild Cherry, Ardlathan, is out
of water again, after a six weeks’ run. and
is applying for total suspension. The White
Crystal battery is already calling for all
sorts of alterations, and the rest of the
plant is a joke. Druml'ish Hill has raised
another little lot of very fair ore —about 10
tons since the last crushing. Others have
gouged out a few tons. Apart from the
Carpathia, that’s the sort of field it is, and
that’s the sort of field it always looked as
though it would be.
Great Cobar’s manager, Hogan Taylor,
asked the A.M.A. officials if they would give
him an assurance that, in the event of the
copper mine restarting, they would not ask
for an advance of wages for at least 12
months. This was practically agreed to;
but when asked straight out if it was the
co.’s intention to restart. Hogan Taylor
side-stepped, though he said he had received
no instructions to apply for further suspen-
sions on the Cobar Gold and Chesney leases.
As the suspensions expire at the end of the
present month, this has been construed
locally to mean that operations will com-
mence in March. With wages more or less
fixed for 12 months, and with underground
mullocking caught up. Great Cobar should
be able to show a fair profit. If it can’t
pay under these conditions, and with copper
close up to £7O, the proposition had better
be turned down.
* * * *
G.S.A., Cobar, applied twice for labor
suspensions, which the Warden refused. The
co. was hurt and appealed to the District
Court. The appeal was heard a few days
ago, and the Warden had his decision upheld.
The co. may therefore now get a move on.
Manager McKenzie is leaving shortly.
* * * *
Westralia exported £177,017 worth of min-
erals other than gold in 1914, or £158,088
less than in 1913. The war caused the fall.
Principal decreases were : Copper, £104.212 ;
tin, £30.893: and silver-lead ore, £12,035.
Total production to end of December was
£3,022,078, of which copper represented
£1,293.103; tin, £1,107.700; silver, £330.293;
silver-lead ore, £517,301, and miscellaneous,
£314,275. The industry is still very sick.
The State batteries of Westralia last year
treated 59,014 tons of ore, attached residue
plants handled 52.000 tons of assorted
tailings, and a couple of tin-dressers dealt
with 0994 tons of dirt and rock for a total
revenue of £59,357. Expenditure was £0504
in excess of revenue. To date 32 gold mills
and cyaniders have recovered £4,303,372. and
two tin plants £84,027. or a total of
£4,387,999. As many of the plants have been
idle most of their time, the loss has, never-
theless, been considerable. Still the State
has benefited indirectly, so what it has lost
on the merry go-round it has picked up on
the swinging-boats. Besides providing gold
and tin treatment plants, the Government
rendered the following assistance to lease-
holders and prospectors last year: Advances
to work and equip shows with machinery,
£4015 ; ditto for erection of plants, and sub-
sidies on stone crushed for the public,
£7248; ditto in aid of boring, £24SB; ditto
in providing means of transport, £131; total,
£13.882. An additional £10,548 was mopped
up in the purchase of tailings.
A Melbourne syndicate, promoted by Syd.
Yeo. of Perth, and including Young Bill
Robinson and friends, has bought the Eclipse
lease at Pinnacles (W.A.), and taken an
option on the Aurora in the same locality.
Both blocks are near those on which the
Black Range Cos. is spending money with, it
is claimed, first-rate results. Altogether,
250 ft. of driving on stuff worth an oz. for a
width of 4ft. to sft. is said to have been
done, and at 220 ft. below the surface sul-
phides worth from 20dwt. to 30dwt. are
alleged to be visible. A further allegation
is that the shoot has been proved to within
30ft. of the Aurora boundary, and that an
outcrop showing gold runs through that pro-
pertyA
“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : Golden Butterfly’s
doom is apparently sealed. The shutters are
up, the manager has resigned, and the co.’s
cry for financial help seems to have fallen
on deaf ears. Meantime the few pub- and
store-keepers that still hang out in the
adjacent dull and dreary township of
Ivookynie are trying all they know to get the
mine going again. The Butterfly, alive,
meant about £I2OO a month towards the
support of Ivookynie, and as it means nothing
dead, the place, for want of other substantial
help, is on its uppers. Some of the badly-hit
have commissioned a local newspaper
spruiker to proclaim that with a further
£3OOO behind it the mine would have a good
chance. What it really is short of is gold
in its ore. The Bulletin remarked at the
time the show was floated that it would pro-
vide revenue from ore treatment for a time,
hut that there would be no profit for the co.
from the work. That opinion still stands.
Since David Melvin left Frenchman’s
Reef, Daylesford, it hasn’t had a mascot
worth a pound of figs, and six months’ work
only ended in 957 tons going to the battery
for £978 worth of gold. This won’t keep up
Board fees and pay petty cash, so parties of
tributors have been turned into the upper
levels. The terms were not over generous,
as the co. collars 25 p.c. of the gold. Still
things turned the right way, and the last
crushing averaged a good lUdwt. The co.
badly needed this, too, as the holders of
12.000 shares have jibbed at putting up
more stuff, so the co. is down to a regis-
ter of 20,000 live ones. For some reason
Mines Minister Brown refuses any grant-in-
aid, so the Frenchman’s must struggle along
as best it can. At No. 6 level it has a
quarry of quartz to shoot at, but the grade
isn’t there; and only an occasional patch of
rich ore shows in the vuggy stuff at No.
7. The co. should ask the Minister to send
a good geologist to trace the course of the
shoots, as there is a hope in other directions
than those into which the cash has gone.
The last yarn is that a good prospect has
been got at the surface near the shaft. If
so anew shaft might put the co. on its feet.
A late crushing of 15oz. from 133 tons told
that Golden Age, Bendigo, was as squibb.v
as ever. Other places might ask why road
metal went to the battery. Not so Bendigo,
because the one sampler trusted is the bat-
tery. The co. has now got the levels at
728 ft. and 853 ft. connected, and stopes
going out may or may not add to the sup-
plies of road metal. Off the north shaft
there is a chance of getting decent stone
over the fault, and a little flutter here isn’t
improbable, especially as Golden Tyke and
Constellation next door have had a profitable
experience of the kind. The third string to
the Golden Age’s bow is on the Paddy’s Gully
line, where, off the Shellback shaft, a nar-
row formation is being driven on the west
leg below 180 ft. A color or two of gold has
been got here, and any further improvement
would help things immensely, seeing the. im-
portance of the line. Still, that wouldn’t
alter the fact that Golden Age is squibby.
Ajax. Daylesford, spent £4OOO in wages
last half-year, and ended the term with the
poor credit balance of £4OO. This was on
4200 tons crushed for 12600 z. A lot of work
was done in the north end of the lease in
the hope of getting an extension of the shoot
which temporarily puffed North Ajax into the
belief that it was a mine. At No. 10 this
formation is sft. wide, but the occasional
prospects are oases in a wilderness. At. No.
9 a. little more gold shows, so there is a
hunt for the metal overhead and north off a
rise up 111 ft. Fair stone has been got, but
it is too narrow to be depended on. Most
of the stone going to the battery comes from
MacMillan’s line, but here, too, the tally
isn’t inspiring. The Ajax crowd has done
so well out of the old mine that it will give
it a chance by developing more of the reef
at Nos. 10 and 11 levels. Asa side show
the co. may thrust out to see if there are any
new makes off the North Ajax formation.
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers,
crushed 1240 tons for £3244, and cyanided
1200 tons of sands and slimes for £lOOl.
The profit for the month was £Bl5, which
follows £960 for the previous month. Costs
are much higher than they used to be. and
the bottom level (about 3000 ft. vertical)
doesn’t promise well at present. The Ex-
tended has lower levels than any other mine
on the Towers, though its neighbor, the
Deeps, is opening No. 8 below 2750 ft. In
the general depression Blocks have been
traded in to a small extent on the chance
of good stone being struck in a rise towards
the hanging wall reef, which carries fair
gold near the Deeps’ boundary.
Gympie made a more lively market for
No. 3 Columbia shares on the strength of
patches of specimen stone where the quartz
comes in contact with black slate. Twenty
head of stampers are kept going, and the
returns continue profitable. A 3d. dividend
w T as paid this month. Last year No. 3
crushed 6202 tons for 54380 z., and 3s. was
paid (£9600).

At Cloncurry (Q.) the Corella is
expected to commence smelting in March.
The mine is nine miles from the MacGregor
railway, so the matte will have to stand
transport costs to Hampden, where it is to
be converted into blister.
* * * *
Eyre’s Peninsula Petroleum Cos. (S.A.)
drilled one “dry,” though not deep, well, and
then called a meeting to ask its advice on
the suspension of work until Dr. Wade had
reported on “the possibility of oil being
struck.” The meeting wisely decided to
drill another well and not wait for Dr.
Wade’s say-so. The co. reports finds of
bitumen on its country, and oil seepages on
the cliffs have been often recorded. On the
evidence the only arbiter is the drill.
* * * *
“Mil”: Re par. (B. G/l/’ls) concerning
South Australian search licenses for oil.
The search license is liable to forfeiture if
active work is not started within three
months, and the longest exemption procur-
able is three months. The search license
gives the holder a preferential right to leas-
ing, and the leases must be manned with a
man to every 40 acres. So the Department
doesn’t lose control. The only “Yankees”
who are grabbing oil in the South-East are,
anyhow, attempting the grab with very
honest drilling plants and modest capitalisa-
tion. If they make l" ney. it’s plainly going
t.i be out of oil; and they can't do it without
also making Australia a lot richer.
Croydon (Q.) crushed 4958 tons last year
for 70290 z., worth £15,222, and 1508 tons
of tailings returned £7325. The best mines
were Cuthbert’s Content, 2297 tons for
£5307; Viles’s Block, 752 tons for £2983;
Golden Gate No. 8. 925 tons for £2610;
Richmond, 170 tons for £1598. The last
named produces a silver-gold alloy worth
30s. per oz.; and for the whole field the
bullion averaged only £2 3s. 3d. per oz.
* * * *
Roma still agitates for tin* development of
its suspected oil field. The Government,
after threatening for years to take action, has
now sent Hargreaves (hydraulic engineer) to
the United States to “look round,” and inci-
dentally to pick out an oil expert. When
Hargreaves returns with the Yankee
specialist something may be done —-or, on the
other hand, may not.

RITCHIE, S. Australia’s new Minister of
Public Works.
Luke Clough, the new M.L.A. for Bendigo
East, though an employer, is so ardent a
Laborite that some of the terrified Tories
about Bendigo class him as a red-ragger. He
is a bald-pated young man, a clear speaker
and a bootmaker. Years ago he gave Ben-
digo cold shivers by turning out in a local
Eight Hours Demonstration in a vehicle
decorated with the watchwords of the French
Revolution —Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.
It was looked upon as a dreadful thing to
do, since the spectacle would certainly tend
to drive capital out to Eaglehawk, or perhaps
Kangaroo Flat.
Died at Hawthorn (Vic.) the other day
Vernon Lawrence, Melbourne Uni-
versity’s first M.B. (1808). He was a native
of Tasmania.
Mrs. J. B. Watson, widow of Bendigo’s
first Quartz King (George Lansell being
the second), has passed out at 82. The old
lady was full of anecdotes about the early
days of the diggings. J. B. Watson pro-
duced 12 tons of gold from the Kent Quartz
Mine down to 4Uoft., and put about 10 tons
of it into Melbourne city property. lie
preferred mortgages to calls, and rents to
dividends. Once he went to Melbourne,
leaving his wife in a tent with 25000 z. of
gold and a double-barrelled pistol. She hid
the gold in the wood-heap, and when the
thieves burgled the tent, she fired about a
pound-weight of nails at them, without ever
learning the result. Malcolm McEacharn
married the eldest Miss Watson; Judge Pope
Cooper’s brother a second; “Billy” Mur-
doch, the cricketer, another; Paul Ivitz, the
Melbourne wine merchant, the fourth, and
one Hall captured the youngest.
THE HORNET'S NEST.
BILL: “ Mein Go ll! Idt vos loaded! ”
Bill Dyson’s London exhibition of car-
toons—“ War Satires,” he calls them—at
Leicester Galleries seems to have put the
coping-stone on his English reputation. The
Daily Mail hails him as the most virile of
British cartoonists, “a Sydney Bulletin
product suddenly become famous.” H. G.
Wells writes of having followed with in-
creasing admiration “the inexhaustible com-
ment of this extraordinary artist.” The
war cartoons have gone into a volume
published by John Lane, a much more pre-
tentious affair than Dyson’s previous books
of pictures. The originals were greedily
bought up at a time when eminent painters
couldn’t sell for the price of hoots in London.
“Billy Blue’s” epistle :
The appointment of James Mitchell as Inspector-
General of the N. S. Wales police recalls that the
first “chief” was Herbert Keeling, appointed by
Governor Phillip, August 7, 1789, under the title of
Inspector. His force consisted of 12 men. In 1797
Governor Hunter increased the force to 36 in Syd-
ney and 18 in Parramatta, but I can nowhere find a
record of the officer in charge. In 1810 Macquarie
thoroughly reorganised the service and made D’Arcy
Wentworth Principal Superintendent (salary £2OO
per annum). He held the position till 1825, when
Captain Francis N. Rossi arrived from England with
the appointment of principal superintendent. His
salary was £7OO, and he had an official residence —
on the site of St. Philip’s Church in York-street.
In August, 1533, Governor Bourke passed the Towns
Police Act, and placed the superintendence under the
control of the first 'principal magistrate (hence “Police
Magistrate”). Captain Rossi retired and Colonel 11. C.
Wilson was given his billet at £6OO a year. He
held the fort till 1839, when he was succeeded by
Charles Wind ever, grandfather of the late Judge,
who remained on till the Sydney Municipal Council
Incorporation Act of 1542 directed the appointment
of a Commissioner of Police. William ’Augustus
Miles was selected and paid £5OO annually. The
dual control by the Government and Council proved
a failure, and in 1850 the force was reorganised
some more, and William Spain took charge as the
first Inspector-General, with a seat in the Legislative
Council. In 1852 he retired to practise as a solici-
tor, and William Colburn Mayne took his place.
He was a Western pastoralist, and married Frank
Suttor’s sister. In 1856 Captain John McLerie,
formerly of the 58th Regiment, replaced him and
filled the bill through the stirring bushranging days,
till he died in 1874. Edmund Walcott Fosbery,
tlie next man, retained the position till 1904. Then
came Thomas Garvin, Ernest Chailes Day (dead the
other day), and now James Mitchell.
Major-Gen. Downes, who retired from the
command of the forces in Victoria 13 years
ago, is spending the dusk in V ictoria. He
had his 81st birthday last Wednesday, lhe
General was Victoria’s Commandant when
the five contingents were fitted out and
despatched to the Boer war.
Not long after the outbreak of war Colonel
lleay, Melbourne Herald’s old editor, was
appointed chief of a division of London {spe-
cial Constables. lie has just been made
Inspector-General of the whole 31,000.
Reay began life as a sailor, climbed up the
rungs of Australian journalism, and became
editor of the Melbourne Herald. Incidentally,
having got some military experience in
the militia, he went as Herald correspondent
to the Boer war, and wrote as “Jack Boot.’
A couple of years ago he handed the editor-
ship over to Davidson, and proceeded to
London as the regular correspondent of the
paper.
When George Black missed a portfolio by
a few votes various N.S.W. Labor Ministers
wrote telling him how much they regretted
he was not chosen. Then came Trefle’s death,
and Black hunted up those sad, regretful
epistles, and waited. Now', however, it looks
as if the Premier is anxious that Monish,
strong and influential union secretary for
many years, should have a portfolio. Be-
tween the ability and experience of Black and
Morrish respectively there is a great gulf
fixed, with Morrish on the dim and distant
shore. But Morrish regards Holman with
something like worship, and Black, a hard,
somewhat soured battler, does not worship
anybody that wears trousers, and, moreover,
he is one of those most inconvenient persons
w'ho think the first duty of a Labor Ministry
is to carry out the Labor platform.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant” :
Sydney can show as mixed a lot of Mayors as
Melbourne (B. 28/1/T5). The two cities were in-
corporated in the same year, 1843. (Strictly, Syd-
ney was then a city, having a bishop and a cathe-
dral, while Melbourne only reached the dignity
when Bishop Perry arrived in 1847.) In its chair
Sydney has had of builders and contractors, five
(Flood, 1849; G. Smith, 1859; Sutherland,
1861; Thos. Spence, 1863; .T. Sutton, 1866);
solicitors, four (G. Allen, 1845 ; J. F. Josephson—
afterwards a barrister and District Court Judge
—1848; W. Thurlow, 1851-2; Thos. Hughes,
1902-3-7 and -8) ; property owners, three (John
Harris, 1881-2-3-8 and -9; Sydney Burdekin, 1890-1;
Matt Harris, 1898-9-1900) ; publicans and ex-pub-
licans, four (Oatley, 1862; Merriman, 1873-7-8;
Palmer, 1875-6; C. ,T. Roberts, 1879); painters,
three (Walter Renny, 1870 ; M. Chapman, 1871-2 ;
S. S. Goold, 1874); wine dealers, three (H. McDer-
mott, 1846; Dan Egan, 1853; George Thornton,
1857) ; butchers, two (Geo. Hill, 1850 ; Thos. Play-
fair, 1885) ; agents, etc., two (W. P. Manning,
1891-2-3-4 ; G. T. Clarke, 1912) ; merchant, John
Hosking, 1843; Tanner, J. R. Wilshire, 1844; tailor,

PREPOS TEROUS!
THE INNOCENT: “ Well , even if you two
political blokes have agreed not to fight,
you needn't put on your coals. 'Ow about
doin' a bit o' work?"
Gerald E. Herring, who died last week,
came to N. S. Wales at the age of 20, and
sat on a stool in the Lands office. In 1874,
when the Mines Department was established,
he was appointed Chief Clerk, Ilarrie Woods
being the Under-Sec.; and, having seen
Broken Hill discovered and the mining
revival well on its feet, he retired and drew
his comfortable pension for 21 years.
Colonel Holmes, the officer who made the
doubtful bargain with the Germans at
Rabaul, is back in his chair as secretary of
the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage
in Sydney. Holmes is the son of a soldier.
His father was a non-com. in the 12tli Regi-
ment, who retired when the corps left Syd-
ney, and be am- chief clerk on the military
staff at Dawes Point.
THE INSPECTION.
The Kaiser is on a visit of inspection to his navy
at Wilhelmshaven. — Cable.
THE VOICE DOWN THE RAT-HOLE : “How
you vas?"
That amazing Victorian, Arthur Lynch,
poet, engineer, physician, French scholar,
war correspondent, Colonel, and Member of
the House of Commons, left off writing his
great thing on psychology to produce various
sonnets. Then he got up one morning
before breakfast and added to the collection
a learned Essay on the Sonnet as an Instru-
ment of Poetry. Incidentally, he has also
just finished “Ireland: Its Vital Hour.”
Writing to one of his numerous tribe in
Australia, Lynch says that in this book he
has remembered nothing except that he was
an engineer summing up the materials avail-
able for a big job—the big job being the
building of the new Irish nation.
R. G. V. Dulhunty, the best-known man
in the mid-west of N. S. Wales, is in April
to step out of his ancient job of stock
inspector. Born in 1848 he was the third
son of Robert V. Dulhunty, who was the
first settler on the Macquarie at Dubbo;
and the family has ever since been watching
sheep grow in the mid-Western District.
11. G. V. Dulhunty was badly hit in the
drought of 1875-7, and a year later subsided
into the billet of stock inspector. His grand-
father was that Dr. Dulhunty, an army sur-
geon, who in the very early days captured a
gang of bushrangers at Burwood—now a
suburb of Sydney. His other grandfather was
Colonel J. G. N. Gibbes, formerly Collector
of Customs, and nominee member of the old
Legislative Council.
A young man working on one of the Lake
Wanaka sheep stations in north-western
Otago (M.L.) —where the roar of the ava-
lanche mingles with the bleat of the fat lamb
—rolled up his blankets one morning and set
out to look for a khaki suit. Fourteen days
later he strolled into the recruiting camp at
Timaru, 400 miles from where he started,
and inquired the way to Tipperary. His
boots weren’t worth tuppence then, hut
they’d carried him over every yard of what
is known as the central route, the roughest
long track in all Maoriland. In view of the
growls—mostly from Fat importers, etc. —
that the young men are not coming forward,
The Bulletin is now waiting for someone
to report the case of a squatter who walked
as much even as 50 miles to put his little
contribution of cash on to the nation’s plate.
It was announced triumphantly during the
week that under the scheme of public works
just adopted by the Holman Government, the
Norton-Griffiths middlemen had agreed to
preference to unionists. Of course they
had agreed to preference. Why shouldn’t
they? If preference to unionists costs a
trifle, it is to Norton Griffiths’ immediate
advantage to agree to it. It is to their
immediate advantage to agree to every-
thing that adds to the cost, because the
greater the cost the greater the commission.
PEACE-TIME PATRIOTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Bompas was a merchant who was loyal to the
core,
Young Bowcher as a soldier was the same.
While Bompas sang Britannia with a fine britannic
roar,
The younger hero played the sterner game.
The loyalty of Bompas seemed forever to increase;
Its only fitting measure was in tons.
The bravery of Bowcher stood the fiercest tests of
peace,
His office was an armory of guns.
On royal birthdays Bompas joined in patriotic songs,
And called the Labor crowd disloyal brutes,
Whilst Bowcher with his sabre bared, and spurs with
giant prongs,
Stood sternly by the guns and fired salutes.
When Bompas saw at peace parades the flag that
rules the waves,
He shouted till lie very nearly burst.
Whilst marching past in uniform to military staves,
The lounger man looked fit to face the worst.
Then Britain found an enemy, who smote her, thigh
and flank;
The Empire wanted money—wanted men.
And Bompas was a merchant with a balance at the
bank,
And Bowcher had the skill and strength of ten.
The old man’s cash was just the thing most needed
on that day.
The young man’s age was absolutely right.
But Bompas would do anything on earth excepting
pay.
And Bowcher would do anything but fight.

TO THE SOLDIERS.
LORD KITCHENER’S MESSAGE.
The public of Sydney has been waiting
ever since the cables came through stating
that the British Expeditionary Forces had
proceeded to France, for the full text of
Lord Kitchener’s advice to each member of
that historic company. It has now been
cabled out; and one of the chief of all sen-
tences in it, and fraught with great mean-
ing, reads: “Your duty cannot be done
unless your health is sound.”
Health to the soldier fighting for his
country, or to the civilian fighting the great
trade battles at home, is essential. A
healthy army should be a successful army,
and Captain 11. E. U. Burke, formerly of
the “Third King’s African Rifles,” British
East Africa, states that Clements Tonic is
the ideal nerve medicine for the soldier on
active service, or recuperating after severe
illness or fever. It is the medicine that has
always been to the front throughout Aus-
tralia, and its effect upon weak or sorely-
tried nerves is little short of miraculous.
All chemists and stores sell it everywhere.*
Otard Brandy
15 YEARS OLD
IS A TRUE COGNAC BRANDY.
Otard Brandy is the pure distillation of the grape,
matured for years in the famous historic Chateau de
Cognac, where Francois 1. King of France, was born.
This Chateau now forms the cellars and premises of
THE MAISON OTARD-DUPUY. For sickness or
health, as a liqueur or as a beverage, there is no spirit
to equal.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 15, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
'February, the dead end of social frivols in
Sydney in peaceful seasons, is deader than
usual in this year of Wilhelm’s great crime.
Even the surf is taken more seriously. For
the moment the Smart Girl is sulking at
the official embargo on pleasure jaunts to
Egypt, and has collapsed like a closed con-
certina.
The mountains are catching a steady flow
of refugees from the vaporous coast. Medlow
Bath is sheltering a crowd of visitors.
Amongst those who sniff the early autumn
nip in the air up aloft are the Wilfred Met-
calfe pair. Mrs. Dangar and a couple of
daughters, Spencer Nolan and his wife, Mrs.
Gordon Marr, and ex-Justice George Simo-
son, and Dame Martha Simpson. The
golfing Bellingtons were at Medlow last
week, after a vigorous attack on the
Kosciusko links. Nellie Stewart was rest-
ing there, and the McCabes, a helping of
the Teece family, and Mrs. Edwin Geach
were viewing the knobby scenery thereabouts
a few days ago.
Man-o’-War steps surged with politicians
and others on Saturday afternoon, while
Mayor Richards waited for Archbishop
Cerretti, the Papal Delegate, to step ashore.
During this dull interval the photographer
was continuously hunted off the premises.
Anything in the shape of a camera is contra-
band, these days, by the Harbor shore. The
voice of authority, trembling with emotion,
pointed out to the more persistent snap-
shotters that Man-o’-War steps were in the
keeping of the Admiralty—and everybody
was supposed to know what that meant.
After many feigned retreats, harassed snap-
shotters tried to propitiate the bluejacket
who was the naval peri at the portal. He
was beefy in exterior, but granite under-
neath. Obviously somebody at Garden
Island unbent later, and the official landing
of the first Papal delegate in Australia was
snapped without smashing up the Empire.
The Italian Excellency has a soft smile
and a honeyed manner. He won’t scratch,
but will spill oil on many troubled waters
if his suavity and the silky texture of his
bright violet gloves be any criterion. Eccle-
siastic millinery is beyond the lay mind at
any time. But one noticed that the visitor
from Rome had silk drapery of an exquisite
shade, some intermediate tint between deep
rose and violet. Archbishops Kelly and
Carr, with a dignified tail of bishops, wore
gorgeous purple in their trimmings, and
jambed their best hats on top of small caps
of the same Tyrian hue.
Mayor Richards, having shaken the
stranger’s violet glove, presented a back-
ground of official frock-coat of various de-
nominations. John Meagher, M.L.C., with
an order of some papal significance dangling
from his shirt-front, and Town Clerk Nes-
bitt were in this throng. Horsemen who
had put their heads through much finery in
the shape of Hibernian collars, pranced
round the posy of Archbishops as the pro-
cession crawled uphill towards St. Alary’s
Cathedral. The picturesque building was
full to the doors. Portion of the crowd
inside already had its noses firmly glued to
the outer altar railing as the gorgeous
retinue marched up the main aisle. John
Lane Alullins, who had a front seat inside
this enclosure, with the veteran John
Ateagher, was regarded with spasms of envy
by lovely Woman. She was so taken with
the cut of Cerretti’s violet-i'ose sash that I
fancy she’ll try something of the kind on her
best Easter dress. The William Patrick
Alannings, Justice Heydon, a swarm of lesser
foreign Consuls with unspeakable names.
Senator Keating, Dr. Odillo Alaher and his
wife, and a serried array of local aldermen,
were glimpsed at the ceremony.
Governor Strickland will have given a
lunch to Papal Legate Cerretti at Cranbrook
before this reaches you. About 40 covers
will have been set in the vice-regal crib, and
sundry prominent citizens will have had the
opportunity to break oysters with the smiling
newcomer. The digestion of the prominent
citizen must either toughen or go to bits as
a result of the feasts which the props of
the State have to work through. A leading
Sydney doctor declares that the banquet is
chiefly responsible for the early death of
many Labor men. They give up outdoor
manual exercise and simple fare for seden-
tary office life studded with expensive baked
meats, and the enemy catches them in the
middle of the race.
Airs. Rodham, whose husband is private
secretary to Admiral Patey, is booked to
leave for London in a few weeks. She is
one of the backers of the naval at-homes to
seamen’s wives. The strong-minded Miss
Henderson, sister of the senior naval sprig
of that name, who has the quarter deck
demeanor of an Admiral, is First Lady at
these reunions. Mrs. Radcliffe, another
Tar’s wife, who has helped to keep the tea-
urn on the boil, is also winging north.
Major Forbes, the long Scot who was on
the staff of Governor Strickland for a while,
was invalided to England from the entangled
Front. A wounded arm was the trouble.
Now he is on his feet again, in camp, and
will go back to the carnage with Kitchener’s
newest army. The very lively, Mrs. Forbes
is also in England.
The agreeable personality of John Chris-
tian Watson, a one-time Prime Minister, will
be transferred to the other side of the globe
for a time. He is packing to leave on Feb.
20. Premier Holman and his team gave the
departing traveller a farewell snack at Par-
liament House the other noon. There is a
rumor that the popular Vvatson may be
induced to accept assistance on behalf of
the new Labor daily-to-be if it is pressed on
him during his walks abrbad.
Servia, which must be gnawing its last few
pork bones, is to get its wonderful wild-cat
resistance recognised by N. S. Wales. A
cash offering from well-to-do Australians
starts hereabouts with £IOOO from the Gov-
ernment ; and the Under-Sec. for Finance
and Trade, at the Treasury, will receive the
cheques of the affluent and the tuppences of
the poor, and see they go to the right spot.
Archdeacon Boyce, the cold-tea advocate
who was in Germany when the trouble
started, is on board the Orsova, bound for
this port.
Artist Ruby Winckler writes from Boston
(U.S.A.) that she is now working on the
illustrations for a book of Fairy Tales. This
should be right into the hand of the clever
Sydney girl, who has a style of her own, and
can turn out elves and gnomes of weird, fan-
tastic beauty. Miffin anu Cos. are the pub-
lishers. They follow the trail of Ginns, who
have an exhibit at the Panama Exhibition,
in which the “Arabian Nights,” with Ruby’s
pictorial pages, is likely to appear amongst
other editions de luxe. The N.S.W. artist
finds surfing, as they understand it in the
States, rather a poor substitute for the
creamy sands and curling white foam round
our Harbor City. “I tried several places
last summer,” she sighs, “including Nova
Scotia, which is awfully cold, with black
sand and no dressing accommodation; but
they don’t know what surf is in this
country!”
The Australian artists in London held
their annual corroboree in spite of so much
shouldering arms. George Lambert was in
charge of the dinner, which took place at
the Six Bells Hotel, Chelsea; and Will
Dyson, A. J. Daplyn, Fullwood, Longstaff,
Fred Leist and Tom Roberts were amongst
the party.
The Police and Fire Brigades’ Patriotic
Carnival occurs in the Agricultural Grounds
on February 27. Britannia, the strong meat
of these war-time festivals, will petrol on
the heels of the Mounted Troopers’ horses.
The Allies will wear their national drapery
in the procession; the Fire Brigades will
turn their biggest hose on imaginary conflag-
rations ; and a Roman Chariot race will
kick up the usual dust.
The well-known cleric and broth of a boy,
Father O’Reilly, late chief of St. Stanislaus
College, went off to Dublin via ’Frisco in the
Ventura.
Valentine’s Day, which, in the long ago,
added to the baggage of the letter carrier,
has this week materialised in cigars, jam,
’baccy and other comforts for Tommy Kan-
garoo. Instead of sending that strenuous
person hearts and Cupid’s darts on filagree
paner, the not-so-sentimental Red Cross
organisation has chased all likely contribu-
tors for edibles and smokeables. A few
enthusiasts have added revised editions of the
ancient valentine —with such mottoes as
“Keep a stiff upper lip.” Tommy will put
up with that for the sake of the cigarettes.
The hat threatens to be several sizes larger
than last autumn’s pill-box chapeau. For
some occult reason, the leading men-
milliners of Europe (I refer to those who
don’t happen to be in the trenches) are agin
the thimble style of female headgear. So
long as the wide brim doesn’t block his view
of the ballet. Man is inclined to hanker
after plumed hats of the cavalier shape for
his girl’s Sunday crowning. A mild under-
study—a mere pocket edition —of the early
Gainsborough models, is going to put in a
fluffy appearance at Easter. For this relief
from the military toque, many thanks.
Frank Brangwyn, the artist who gave a
lead to the modern revival of decorative fans,
has recently handed over about 200 engrav-
ings to the Luxembourg Museum in Paris.
This gift is regarded as a sentimental expres-
sion of Brangwyn’s mixed nationality. In the
present crisis the famous colorist has a
chameleon sense of belonging to every country
in the western arena of conflict. He is an
Englishman who was born in Belgium and
has spent a good deal of his life in France.
Ilis home is, or was a few months ago, in
Montreuil-sur-Mer —a village which fell
asleep in the 17th century, and has only
opened its eyes to modern innovations at
long intervals since.
Captain Gerald Wordsworth, a great
grandson of the meandering poet, was killed
in action a few weeks ago.
The new version of “David Copperfield,”
produced by Herbert Tree in London, is
notable because of the extinction of Dora,
the girl wife whose cookery rang the changes
between cinders and the raw material. Tree,
who plays Louis Parker’s version, not only
sends Micawber to Australia (there is a
mere allusion to it in the original) but brings
him back fat and affluent. This, indeed,
supplies the final “curtain.” Australia was
a good deal talked of in the Dickens house-
hold, and three sons came this way. Alfred
Tennyson, who settled in Victoria, died
recently; “Ted” (Edward Bulwer Lytton)
passed away some years back. Micawber
was, of course, Dickens senior—the grand-
father of Alfred and Ted; and, delightful
men both, they had many of the qualities of
Charles’s progenitor. Ted, sitting easily
on a. table, giving Micawber’s advice to
young David Copperfield, won the heart of
Wilcannia. That and the like of it really
sent him to the Assembly.
The cookery lectures under the patronage
of the Department of Public Instruction have
bounced against the ironclad prejudices of
some of the mothers of the flock. One
worthy dame sniffed at spending a three-
penny-bit or so on vegetables for soup, and
was deaf to the argument that the stock-pot
must be decently furnished if the family is
to be nourished. She would rather, it
seemed, continue the usual reckless expendi-
ture in tinned food. Angus and Robertson
publish the “Commonsense Cookery Book,”
which was compiled by the school marms
who are at present demonstrating the Right
Way to Feed Father.
Lady Emmett, the only dressy dame who
came this way with the Overseas’ Parlia-
mentary Commission, took much interest in
women’s ways hereabouts. Now she is keen
in helping to distribute Australian offerings
among Belgian refugees. She is chiefly re-
sponsible for the sorting of the garments.
Mr. Herbert Easton, one of the directors
of the Sydney Sun, who makes a hobby of
that rather nebulous institution, The
British Immigration League in N.S.W., was
to have returned this way in the Orsova.
He has been ill, and that and the general
uncertainty of travel have kept him and his
wife longer on the English side than they
expected. They had to cancel their passages
twice owing to the hurried way in which
the War Office has pounced on mail-boats
for transport work.
The Royal Colonial Institute is graciously
pleased to bestow a charter on the N.S.W.
branch. Hon. sec. Macfie is impatiently
waiting to seize this parchment, which may
arrive by any mail. The notion is to give
more freedom to a local executive in its
efforts to support the British Lion when he
roars. The War Office, which in time of
peace used to turn like a snail, has put on
a spurt since the lid blew off the Peace
Society’s saucepan, and in the midst of
seizing this and that, has collared portion
of the R.C.I. premises in Northumberland
Avenue. It was here that W. E. Gladstone
looked over the edge of his extensive collar
at the christening of the baby Institute in
1869; and the then Secretary of State for
the Colonies, Earl Granville, displayed his
profound ignorance of the rich young
“Colonies” at the same banquet. It is
interesting to remember that this feast was
stirred to its last whisky by the prophecy of
Hugh Childers that the Oversea Dominions
were going to be heard of in connection
with sea-power. Childers, who had been
Victoria’s first Minister for Customs, had
been well primed on this subject by Archi-
bald Michie, who, I believe, was the first
representative the London Times had in
Australia. He, by the way, once proposed
that British warships, since they had to do
something, should fill in time and incident-
ally get exercise carrying immigrants to
Australia and Canada. Five Lords of the
Admiralty fainted in their chairs.
The Women’s Liberal League is beating
up funds for more travelling kitchens for
our men at the front. Already it has
caught or cadged coin for five. Now the
highbrow ladies are after a sixth. Mrs.
Francis Cohen, hon. treasurer, is lying in
wait for anything you like to contribute.
Bank of New Zealand Chambers, Wynyard-
street, is her official lair.
The pretty Sheila Chisholm, who was one
of our most captivating buds a couple of
seasons ago, is staying with Mamma in
London.
Miss Dorothy Gurney, a daughter of G. A.
Gurney, of the Hutchins School, Hobart,
has said “Yes” to Ivan Firth, son of a
Gravesend (Eng.) doctor. Dorothy was
studying harmony at the Royal College of
Music, London, when she met and approved
of young Firth. As he has buckled on
harness as lieutenant in the Royal Field
Artillery, his baritone voice, which was for-
merly uplifted on the concert platform, will
be next heard in France.
Admiral Poore and his breezy lady no
longer keep their latch at Chatham on the
click for Australians; but the same hospi-
tality is likely to be offered in their new
abode in Wiltshire. Poore, though he could
not get himself to believe in an Australian
navy when he was Commander-in-Ohief on
this station, is likely to be a convert now
when history is making as fast as the lino-
type can handle it.
Mrs. Dick Steacy, who was Miss Elsie
Denham, of Bananaland, was honeymooning
at Bournemouth when the last mail left.
The Mcßobert family, of Sydney, were re-
cently at the same watering-place. They
had booked to leave England' in March.
Mrs. Murray Will, a sister of Australia’s
big George Reid, is still in the Thames ant-
heap. Dr. Will is also there for a while.
The bolero coat has been revived. The
autumn fashions indicate a return of the
waist to the region of the arm-pits in conse-
quence. The new bolero is longer at the
back than its predecessors, and is rounded
off behind like the dressy plumage of a
dandy cock sparrow.
Dalmatians in Maoriland—mostly workers
on the gum-fields—have sent to London over
£4OO for the Montenegrin Relief Fund. In
the booming days of peace we used to
hurriedly class all the Slav tribes who pull
on the gum-diggers’ boots in M.L. as “Aus-
trians.” We know better now. The dialects
a Maoriland Government agent has to
w T restle with, when he puts the immigrant
Slav through an education test in Sydney,
are said to number rather less than a score.
Hon. secretary H. Chisholm is looking
after the Blue Cross Fund to help wounded
horses: and GO Castlereagh-street will find
him. He announces a collection to date of
about £690. The Russian cavalrymen, by
the way, have a special prayer for their
chargers : “For these humble creatures which
support with us the burden of the day, and
offer their innocent lives for the country....
have pity, O Master!”
A German woman-doctor, Frau Elizabeth
Reinicke, has been officially declared a mili-
tary officer in the Red Cross business. She
is to wear an officer’s uniform, and non-coms,
and privates will have to salute her, while
sentries must present arms when she steps
their way. As the enemy is credited with
keeping the feminist movement under the
heel, this innovation is causing an indignant
tremor in the breast of Private Sauerkraut.
The League of Ancient Mariners had its
annual harbor cruise on Saturday. The shell-
backs had their speeches served up this year
with Continental sauce instead of the usual
helping of old-time “record” sailing-ship
trips—say, three months from London to
Sydney Cove.
Young Hoskins, a son of one of the Lith-
gow ironfounders, has gone in with Beau-
mont Smith in his venture. He is now in
Maoriland where “Seven Little Australians”
are capering round. Hoskins, senior, has
bought land at Ivillara, and,is going to erect
something extra in bricks and mortar. Kil-
lara, as you know, is the suburb where the
householder is supposed to sleep out of doors
with his lawn-mower so that he may pursue
his favorite hobby of grass-cutting before the
sun peeps through the grey dawn.
Dr. Isabel Ormiston, who used to inspect
the ears, eyes and toothache of school kiddies
in Tasmania, has gone to France after a
short spell of rest in England. She is doing
the same useful Red Cross labors there that
earlier in the uproar she accomplished in
Belgium.
At one of the early meetings of the sheep-
skin-waistcoat committee there was a mild
suggestion that coats would be handier for
the fighting man. It was pooh-poohed by
those who know Everything. But it now
appears that sheep or goatskin coats are It,
and Tommy Atkins, when he’s in luck, also
wears a fur- or goat-skin toque, like a flat
tea-cosy. A jumbuck vest is clumsy drapery
to tuck away under the ordinary service coat.
But you’d better not mention that to Dr.
Read, who still lies in wait for contribu-
tions at the Harbor Medical Officer’s quar-
ters at Circular Quay.
A Modern Languages rally at Sydney Uni.
is converting that building into a Tower of
Babel. Whether anyone who has the entree
has the right to hurl a foreign tongue at the
meeting I don't know. But it seems a good
occasion to secure from consuls and the like
a few samples of unknown tongues. For in-
stance, an oration in Slavonic from Mr.
Welch, who speaks up for Russia when our
big ally is too busy to pass the time of day
for himself, would probably illuminate the
eastern situation. At any rate, the French
Consul-General is to be one of the orators.
The Australian Voluntary Hospital at
Boulogne had a recent influx of N.S.W.
trained nurses. Several of these Nightin-
gales paid their own expenses to the scene,
amongst them Miss Mackenzie, of our
Prince Alfred’s. Army surgeons give the
nurses three months’ work at the hospitals
on the fringe of the carnage, and then pack
them off to recuperate. Conditions are so
strenuous, and the nerve strain so tense that
a relief staff has to be constantly maintained.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, February 15, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
At Caulfield ou Saturday the Falkiners
nearly bolted when Norman’s expensive new
animal, Land of Song (he paid £4OOO for it),
justified its high price by leading past the
post. Mrs. Norman exulted in a smart
white cloth suit. The newly-wed Mrs. Leigh
Falkiner accompanied her and duplicated her
smiles in a dove-grey rig, with white chiffon
roses in her hat. Mrs. (’arse (another of
the clan) showed what she could do with
purple, shot-gold and black, and a sister
heaped a cone of lilac on her hat and wore
white lace without doing any visible harm.
It was quite a Falkiner day.
State-Governor Stanley came out, and his
illustrious footsteps were dogged by a slender
Genthelp. There were no womenfolk in
the party, and his Ex. spent nearly all the
time in the bird-cage. Mrs. Woodford, wife
of the V.A.T.C. chairman, wore a tailored
suit of some white, woolly material with
black lines etched upon it, and a flat black
hat atop. Mrs. Casey, who was also in the
official pen, wore a sort of military badge
of gold and red on the lapel of her black silk
coat. The badge is the newest craze in the
dress world. Mrs. Everard Browne startled
even the Caulfield rabbits on the flat with
a muslin dress the color of mustard, and
enormous white muslin Toby neck-frills. She
looked like Queen Elizabeth in her most,
ru filed mood. Mrs. Jack Winter-Irvine
shrank along in her shadow in severe black
glace.
Are the men starting war fashions on their
own? Several smart male dressers wore
pale grey hats with heavy mourning bands
of black; yet their womenfolk walked in
cheerful garments. Stewart Brunton, in
particular, supported a very sad hat, but
his smart wife was untroubled in tussore.
Mrs. Roger Thompson had a lunch party
in the members’ new luncheon rooms. She ate
and drank ’midst frills of pinked-out black
glace, and the black feathers in her hat were
“shrunk” —the newest way of distorting the
clothes of the suffering ostrich. Mrs. Tom
Reynolds (she is the fascinating “Girl in the
Taxi” who married the owner of Swedish
Lad), wore an expensive shreds-and-patches
mixture of purple over gold, edged with lace.
Wool auctioneer Bert Pilley brought his wife
in most fetching black. Mrs. Leslie Mac-
donald was tailored within an inch of her
life, and defied the sun-glare in a pill-box hat.
You see it is absolutely necessary to be seen
abroad in your new autumn gear before the
other Fashion-nlate gets hers. If autumn
isn’t up to time, then so much the worse for
the calendar.
The Bundoura Park Smiths were there.
(Smith made a fortune with the famous Wal-
lace in the days gone by.) Little Miss Smith,
in tricky black and white, took the shady
nart of the terrace with her lately-attached
fiance,. Mr. Govett. The Ilagelthorns were
amongst those visible. Mrs. Hagelthorn
wore a nice frock and a sort of radiance, the
result of a recent visit to the vice-regal
people at Macedon.
The Miller clan was rejoicing over Mrs.
Sep’s new son and heir. Small groups of
people who had just struggled through the
Hobart-Launceston season yarned together,
and agreed that it was very pleasant—very
pleasant indeed!
Captain Harold Evans, a son of Sir
Samuel, who presides over the most fashion-
able court of justice in Britain —to wit. the
Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division —
has come in here to try to recover the health
he lost in the trenches at Mons, where he
was wounded. The captain, a beautiful,
bronzed young man. with a charming man-
nah, is due at the War Office in September.
Melba is back at Coombe Cottage, dally-
ing with roses and butterflies and dahlias,
and, in between times, planning more patri-
otic concerts. The war has compelled her
to alter her exalted plans for the time being,
and this very month both Ballarat and
Geelong will be given opportunities of listen-
ing to the Voice. On such occasions Bal-
larat and Geelong must feel that they afe
the equals of Covent Garden and the Paris
Opera House.
Lieutenant-Major (or should it be
Sergeant-General?) Horne, one of a Vic-
torian medical family, seems to be acting as
a sort of Gentleman Help to Lady Dudley
in her Australian Voluntary Hospital work.
The Major-Corporal took photographs from
every point of the hospital and ambulances
of the A.V.H., and fired them through the
post at his Victorian friends as Christmas
cards. The cards are as ornate, and nearly
as large, as theatrical souvenir programmes,
and local girls are consumed with envy
when they find a lucky sister in full posses-
sion of one of the beautiful advertisements.
The fire at the Pockley-Sargood wedding
in Sydney was fought over again by re-
turned relatives who attended the races.
On the wedding day the big marquee where
the breakfast was set, was burnt to a heap
of ashes through something going wrong
while a flashlight photograph was being
taken. The company, bride, groom, and
all, were toast-drinking at the moment.
They all managed to get out safely,
but the marquee was finished in five
minutes, the decorations helping the flames
to leap round. One or two men got their
hands burnt saving scared women and their
party frocks from the sudden furnace.
Everything else was burnt or boiled —wed-
ding bouquets, cloaks, champagne, food and
all. Fortunately the wedding was “quiet,”
so the handful of 80 or 90 select guests had
enough money in their clothes to buy some
plain food on their way home.
_ After its long vacation the Repertory
Theatre Club held a great rally, at the Salon,
on Friday evening. It was also the annual
meeting, and when the dry business had been
done, everything theatrical under the sun
was discussed in a sort of monkey-house
hubbub that made late wayfarers in the lane
below pause and wonder if something hadn’t
burst. Above all other theatrical topics, the
(flub argued about its war-clouded prospects.
Gregan McMahon and his players are
going to break out afresh in April. It will,
in fact, be a sort of overture to the European
campaign. They threaten “The Great Ad-
venture” as the principal item of their
syllabus. The rights of the piece have just
been secured from author Arnold Bennett.
The Fan Dango Maekays took two horses
over to the Apple Island hoping to see them
go faster than all the others. But the
creatures became violently seasick on the
journey, and ended by keeping to their
stables. (I really don’t know why this
should go in a girl’s letter, dear; but some-
one gave me the information and I had to
work it off somewhere.)
One of Rolf Boldrewood’s daughters, Mrs.
R S. Black, is visiting here from her
Westralian home. Unfortunately, the sport-
ing lady is only convalescing after a severe
illness, and is debarred from the excitements
of present race-meetings, being under doctor’s
orders to stay in the hills.
Unie Russell, of the tragic Cilia marriage,
is at present in England teaching English to
Belgian refugees on behalf of some duchess
or other. The duchess has befriended the
young Belgians and is giving them house
room, food and instruction free. Six months
ago Unie was with a theatrical co. that was
playing “The Rosary.” But the town they
were in was suddenly declared a thistle or
a military area or something, and that burst
up the show.
Unie’s poor little husband is still
struggling through the dull daily round.
Someone who is familiar with the' “inside”
tells me that the little Chinaman was given
gardening work to do; but he fainted over
the lawn mower and was then considerately
passed on to a clerical job.
George Seltli Coppin, the only grandson
of the famous old actor, has gone to the war
with a drayload of flags, flash-lamps, helio-
graphs and rockets. These are not
theatrical props for a forthcoming enter-
tainment, but merely signallers’ material.
He was working in Allan’s music warehouse
when the Call came, and the folk there gave
him a notable send-off.
Beatrice Day, who used to nurse before
she took to the stage, made good use of a
South African medal during her foraging
for patriotic pennies. The Day smile and
the medal combined simply stunned all she
attacked, and the result made a great jingle.
The medal was awarded for her devoted
nursing of smallpox. The nightmarish
disease broke out on a crowded troopship,
and she loyally helped the doctor to throw
it overboard.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
What the weather could do to wreck Tattersall’s
meeting it did. Wilting heat was followed on
Saturday by tearing wind and clouds of choking
dust. At lunch and afternoon tea what you ordered
was a detail—grit was the only perceptible flavoring.
And it was only at precious intervals that backers
were able to distinguish the jockeys’ colors. There
were no sensations, in racing or dividends or clothes.
The Martindale Club on Wednesday had better luck
—a good day and good racing, in spite of reduced
prize money, and an attendance that included many
of the squattocracy.
Petersburg, usually remarkable only for the fact
that it is a junction town of some importance on
the Great Northern line, made a bid for fame during
the week by a wholesale attack of ptomaine poisoning.
Of the hundred-odd who collapsed all had eaten a
certain brew of ice-cream, and some of the cases
were serious enough to make this Polar mystery
unpopular in that town for many a summer. The
Board of Health is turning its gimlet on to the
matter.
One of the Sandland clan from the Burra left by
th- Moldavia on Thursday to join King Edward’s
Horse. The Walter Hawkers’ eldest son was a
passenger by the same boat, inspired also by the
war. Meanwhile those of the community who can
only stay at home and knit socks are privileged to
feel the pinch of the times. Thus bread is up to sd.
a loaf, and seems inclined to go on. Rents are the
only things that are coming earthwards, possibly
because they’d climbed so high that they are collaps-
ing from exhaustion.
But London must be a still more drear place in
these days for the female worker. A recent letter
from an Adelaide woman says “thousands who have
never done anything- in their lives are now trying to
work —some because they must, a few because they
want the distraction. No one is calling out, the
tension is too great, but thousands of people are
very hard hit.” Elaborate dress is apparently right
“off,” and girls who have strained their eyes work-
ing at exquisite embroidery for model gowns are
doing plain sewing for hospitals and refugee camps.
Died on Saturday, at Victor Harbor, Mrs. O. 11.
Lindsay, widow of one of the State’s pioneer sur-
veyors. The family had lived in the South for years,
and had given a helping hand in most schemes for
local advancement.
Friday’s papers announced the marriage of Dr.
C. W. Hamilton to Mrs. Langhorne. The engage-
ment had only been made public at the beginning
of the week —a rare triumph of secrecy in a place
where most people know more of their neighbors’
business than they do of their own. Dr. and Mrs.
Hamilton leave for England this month.
Lady Doris Blackwood arrived by Friday’s Mel-
bourne express, and detrained at Aldgate for Marble
Hill, where she is to stay with the Galways.
The last Egyptian mail brought news of the
marriage, in Cairo, of Mr. P. Robin, of the South
Aus. Expeditionary Force, to Miss Nellie Honeywill
a South Australian who has been living in London.
Mrs. Warren Edwards and her nestlings leave for
London in March.
Mrs. C. H. Angas leaves for England in March.
She is taking with her two small grandchildren to
rejoin their mother, Mrs. R. D. Ryder, who returned
to the Land of Fogs in October. Captain Ryder has
been at the front since the early part of the war.
As the Pursey Chirnsides 18-year old son
and heir insists on being a soldier, his
parents have determined he shall do so in
style. They are bustling off to England
with him bv the Osterley, heedless of mines
and German threats.
Edytlie, of the Landale tribe is off to join
husband Cyril, who is rehearsing with King
Edward's Horse in England for the forth-
coming Storing rush to Berlin.
Parisian women are taking up and im-
proving on an old dodge of the experienced
Domain dosser. They are making news-
paper vests for their men in the trenches.
The news of the day is made into a water-
proof, cold-resisting lining with tar.
Eugenia Stone Doughty, widow of the
trawling knight and former Chatterer in
this column, has gone to. France with a
Melbourne girl who used to “flat” with her
in her journalistic days. The feminine
expeditionaries propose to give what help
they can, and, incidentally, gather war
‘ copy.”
I hope you have your own little Chant of
Hate for the Bernhardi man, my dear. The
very observant young lady who was a gover-
ness in the household of a German prince had
it from her employer’s wife that “women were
imt much higher than the four-footed animal
kingdom for Bernhardi; that he loudly con-
tradicted his wife at hotel tables when they
travelled together; that he always walked
ahead of her in the_ street, and pushed past her
or even other ladies, if they were strangers to
him, in order to go first through a doorway.”
Isn’t it disgusting to find a man doing what
the best-mannered of us women do to one
another at bargain-sale time?
From “Rosna,” now knitting socks in
London: —-
The Daily Mail has been busy proving to its
billion readers that there’s a place called Australia
on the map. Within three days it has published
(1) a full-page Bill Dyson cartoon, with sketch of
the artist’s career, (2) a long- dissertation on the
Australian troops in Egypt, (3) an article on the
Australian Voluntary Hospital in France. According
to No. 3 the A.V.H. had 147 cases on its hands
within 12 hours of its arrival in France, instead of
taking the full week allowed by the authorities to
get into order. In the first week 79 serious opera-
tions were performed. The writer explained,
with British astonishment, that, there being no men
available at the moment, three Australian nurses
scraped the operating-theatre walls and white-
washed them. Awful! What will these colonials
do next?
Heiress Marie Hall has brought with her
seven trunks full of glad rags and a maid to
fix or unfix them as occasion requires; for,
rich as she is, she can only wear one dress
at a time. She has a weakness for Oriental
drapes and colorings, consequently The Block
at tea-time gets a regular series of shocks.
Here is a sample: A cerise trouser-under-
skirt with a lavender lilac-purple, straight-
shirt over all like a smock frock dyed mad.
Do you get that?
Mrs. Ernest Keep and her daughter evi-
dently want to disguise the fact that they
are of Irish descent. They trundle round in
a special little runabout built in the shape
of a shamrock. It is enamelled green and
the cushions are of the good old emerald
line. Two leaves of the shamrock form the
tonneau seats, and a green chauffeur sits
on the third. When loaded the outfit re-
sembles a daintily-served salad.
Acquaintances of the wife of an imported
cleric are tickled at the lady’s open
and tactless denunciation of all and every-
thing Australian. It is a bold shopman who
tries to serve her with any article of local
manufacture. She has a list of uncompli-
mentary adjectives to fling at the pushing
young counter-hand who dares to commend
Australian goods in her presence, instead
of swearing to their foreignness and making
a sale. In fact, it is fairly evident that she
considers Australia supplies only one thing
worth taking—-clerical billets.
Mrs. Jeannie Langtree died at her Toorak
home on Thursday. Her death will be a
shocking blow to her daughter, Mrs. Algy
Landale, who was devoted to her youthful-
looking mother.
Mrs. Muriel Gumming Buchanan has
acquired a baby whose sex is the only dis-
appointing part of the matter at a time
when more men are wanted. Girls seem to
be a habit in the family. Neither sister
Hilda Robertson nor the Grey-Egerton lady
has a son.
Miss Pankhurst is fretting about the out-
of-work tea-girls in this city. The Gaud
Mayor lias promised her a heart-to-heart
talk on the subject, but he says in advance
that the advice he will give her will be
“Turn ’em into housemaids.” But then
Miss Pankhurst doesn’t hold a brief for the
young women who prefer domestic service
to Emancipation. No platform oratress
advocates improved cooking and cleaning
conditions in bachelor boarding-houses or
the homes of married men. Tea-rooms, on
the other hand, are mostly run by women
for women, consequently the anxious
reformer is much concerned about the rights
of the labor concerned therein.
Amy Castles is now convalescing at
Hampton, where the family has a small
cottage and a handy yacht. Amy spends
half her time in the sea and half out of it.
Her voice is “coming back” and there is
already talk of concerts.
The Johnny Dyer couple (she was the
daughter of f. £. Smith) arrived back on
Monday by the Medina after putting in 12
months on the Scottish lakes and on the
yacht of a person in the peerage named
Nairn.
I was much impressed by some verses
entitled “Woman” in a recent Fortnightly.
The first verse deserves quotation—
Her feet are on Time’s endless stair,
Rising from immemorial seas ;
The planets nestle in her hair —
And God lies on her knees.
And yet, mark you, this superb being often
has to do her own washing. No wonder she
is indignant about it.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

What is the Best Beauty Soap
for the Complexion?
There is at present a great controversy
going on in the English newspapers about
the best soap to use for the complexion.
Some advocate the use of one and some
another kind, but they are all satisfied on
one or two points, and those are that for a
soap to be beneficial to the skin, must be
one without coloring matter, and without a
lot of strong, coarse, irritating perfume being
added and also that the soap must be made
from good ingredients without a preponder-
ance of soda, which makes the skin hard.
\n English soapmaker has been able to
combine all the above good qualities in a
so'ip and at the same time to incorporate
some of the puritol wax, which is so much

its pores, keeps it in a healthy and pure

DIAMONDS Reduced Enormously.
Never before in the experience of Aus-
tralia were so many diamonds sold as
last year. Our sales were enormously
large.
WHY ?
Well, we, some two years ago, took on
a sole agency calling for an enormous
output, and to live up to it we
decided to offer diamonds at merely a
broker’s commission above cutters’
landed cost. The first year it did not
pan out too well, the second year the
very large output told, and so we are
continuing the experiment for another
year.
We only sell the higher grades of
diamonds, but our prices are lower
than those of London.

HJ. THOMSON, of Moruya, Auction-
• eer, has received instructions to
submit for sale by auction, at the Adelaide

ARY 27, 1915, at 2.30 p.m., the well-known

close to the I. and S. N. Company’s wharf.
Land comprises lots 1, 3 and 4 of section 1,
containing 1 acre 1 rood. This hotel busi-

nesses on the South Coast. The Auctioneer
strongly recommends this as a SPLENDID
OPPORTUNITY of securing a prosperous
business and the leading position of the town
for Tourist and Bar trade and general Hotel
accommodation. With the above will be
offered the GOODWILL of the business of
the late Thomas Charles Coxon in connec-
tion with the hotel, the FURNITURE at
present in the Hotel, the right to the UNEX-
PIRED PORTION of the LICENSE (ex-
piring 30th June next), and STOCK IA
TRADE, the latter at cost price on day of
sale. The whole will be submitted in one lot
as a going concern.
Certain other Town Lots will also be sub-
mitted on day of sale.
TERMS OF SALE : One-fourth on sign-
ing contract, balance on completion. Stock
in trade, cash.
For further particulars apply to the
Auctioneer, or E. A. H. SHEPHERD,
Solicitor, Morava.
POLITICAL
POINTS
THE TIME IS RIPE.
It only wants someone to start the ball rolling.—
Extract from letter from anybody to everyone.
“Tam” Mackenzie, Maoriland’s High Com-
missioner (who as a one-time supporter of
Massey, then of Ward, and next as leader of
the short-lived 1912 Ministry, has been the
political Vicar of Bray of the South Pacific),
has fallen in at last. In a letter to Winston
Churchill, referring to the work of the “gift”
battle cruiser New Zealand, which Uncle
Cohen shelled out for, Tam declared that the
“gift” was a “most farseeing act of states-
manship,” and that “Canada will undoubtedly
soon follow in the naval lead already given.”
At that time the then 'atest Maoriland elec-
tion figures showed lassey to be in an
almost certain minor.ty. But subsequent
things, including the Dunedin Central by-
election, hint that Massey is secure, and that
Joe Ward’s cake is dough, so Tam un-
fortunately poured his butter on the wrong-
party.
One deputation that interviewed the
Customs Minister in Sydney was from chair
importers. These people told Tudor that
the recent increase in duty would “completely
shut out all chairs up to a value of 78s. per
dozen,” and they urgently besought him to
return to the former tariff, which, “while
offering an ample margin for the protection
of the local industry, would afford an
increase in the revenue.” How the change
was to achieve this surprising feat the
speakers unfortunately omitted to say.
Tudor’s reply was an unnecessarily courteous
refusal. A chair is only a matter of a little
wood, a few nails and a pot of glue, and
Australia produces all these requisites in
abundance. Also men can be trained —if
there aren’t expert men already on hand —;
at short notice to make chairs by the
paddock full, plain and ornamental. Where
then the sense in carting cumbersome,
spacious things like chairs half across the
world when they can be made in the next
street by the unemployed workers who are
waiting to make them?
A QUESTION OF OWNERSHIP.
The Premier stated that he was awaiting a
cablegram from London on the subject of the
Norton-Griffiths agreement. The Government and the
company, he said, were now practically as one.
Holman: “ We're one now, dearie. You’re
mine, ain’t you ? ”
P.E. : “ No, William — you’re mine!”
Talk about a joy ride! Australia im-
ported £1538,583 worth of motor-cars and
bicycles last year, and not only owed for the
lot" but for £21,500,000 worth of mixed
drinks, fur coats, gloves, goggles and other
kinds of foreign comforts as well!
Victoria’s John Weary temporarily woke
up lately to remark that he “didn’t see the
necessity for doing any legislative work at
all at present; if Parliament were suspended
altogether for a while no one would be a
penny worse off.” That’s just it. But if
they don’t do any work, why shouldn’t John
and the other alleged legislators be several
pennies worse off —worse off, in fact, to the
'nil extent of their salaries?
Adelaide Chamber of Manufactures has
esolved to ask all “municipalities, district
councils, public and semi-public bodies, and
large private firms” to keep the State’s fac-
tories going by placing all possible orders
for supplies with local firms. They began
with 130 public bodies, which have nearly
all replied that they will, mostly adding that
they already do. Thebarton (an Adelaide
suburb) suggested that in return the
Chamber of Manufactures might “give favor-
able consideration to the matter of preference
to unionists, which this council upholds.”
S.A. is mostly known outside as a wheat,
wool and wine State ; but it has long enjoyed
a certain amount of Protection and has 1350
factories, with an annual wages-sheet of
three millions sterling.
In Adelaide L. A. Jessop, Arnold Davey,
and other solid commercial men have been
suggesting in the daily papers that the com-
ing elections shall be conducted on a “busi-
ness-like” basis. Each side, they suggest,
should publish its platform, and be allowed
one evening in the Adelaide Town Hall to
enlarge upon the situation. Then they
should simply wait and count votes, instead
of holding endless meetings and exchanging
the personalities which always result. But
the suggestion fell quite flat. And it was
the best way for it to fall. The present
system is quite rotten; but one which
assumes that all the men and women of the
country can be properly put into two groups,
and that if a man doesn’t vote for Jones he
must of necessity quite agree with Smith, is
equally corrupt.
WHAT OUT ADMIRATION AND
SYMPATHY BOILED DOWN TO.
The appeal recently made in N. S. Wales by Lady
Edeline Strickland, through the Chamber of Com-
merce, for special donations on behalf of the starving
Belgians, resulted in a totnf of £7555 12s. 6d.,
including Government subsidy.—Daily Telegraph.
Nowadays it is patriotism and not poverty
that makes the strange bedfellows. When
N.S.W. Upper House, in response to an
Imperial appeal, rushed through the sudden
legislation vesting all chops and beefsteak in
the Treasury, the bones of many good anti-
Socialists must have rattled in their coffins.
With the Dove of Peace cooing in its cage a
Labor Government would have had as much
chance of handing all the Ma State’s meat to
the Tiger as it would of paying off the accu-
mulated debts in a month. But at the Im-
perial call a Labor Government promptly re-
ceives the enthusiastic support of the House
which is supposed to see that the Tiger is
suppressed on every occasion. If there is
much more of this the Tiger may so swell
with pride that his stripes will fly off his
hide like hoop-iron.
The squeal of the squeezed Gerhog
has become quite articulate within the past
few days. Chancellor Von Somebody says
the Fatherland will not tamely submit to
starvation, and the Cologne Gazette talks
of the 000,000 prisoners of war, and the 11
million inhabitants of the parts of Belgium
and Northern France “which are in German
occupation,” all of whom “will have to starve
first.” But the Gerswine's threat of deny-
ing food to the people of the hostile countries
now in his occupation seems more humorous
than frightful. When the Allied armies
have captured the railways leading to the
occupied towns, how is the Gerswine to
prevent the inhabitants from getting away
to their friends? Is he going to spread him-
self all around the city, whilst the native
population sits and starves in the market
place?
A communication received at N.S.W. Pre-
mier Holman’s office last week from Nielsen,
the ex-Minister who draws four guineas a
day and expenses for living in San Francisco
as N.S.W. Trade Commissioner, suggests
that inquiry might be made with reference
to the lines this gentleman works on. It
might reasonably be supposed that a man
who went to California as Trade Commis-
sioner would at an early stage make himself
acquainted with the names and addresses of
trade and business organisations in the
country he hailed from. Yet it would appear
that until now the man who gets four guineas
a day for staying away hasn’t been in a posi-
tion to furnish an inquirer at his office with
a list of Australian Chambers of Commerce
or Chambers of Manufactures. However,
he seems at last to have thought that this
equipment might he useful, so he has written
to his friend Holman asking for it.
Granville State electorate (N.S.W.) is
advertising one of the charming aspects of
the Party system. For generations it was
represented by old John Nobbs, a Liberal.
In 1914 J. T. Lang won the seat for Labor,
much to everyone’s surprise. Ever since
there has been turmoil. Lang’s friends assert
that while no one helped him in the forlorn
hope of outing Nobbs, a scramble has
started to jockey him out of the party nomi-
nation for the election in 1916. Even the
central executive of the P.L.L. took a hand,
they say, and paraded those defeated
hacks who have a pull. The necessity of
providing for party deadbeats is one of the
127 drawbacks of the system. In the turmoil
the sudden boom of the Auburn Political
League Branch is significant. Before the
Branch election for office-bearers for 1915
the membership increased by hundreds, and
it was necessary to hire the town hall for
the meeting. The central executive deputed
Farrar. M.L.C.. a party prop of some import-
ance, to preside, which so angered Lang’s
friends that they broke up the meeting. The
unlovely row is to be ventilated at the
annual meeting of the P.L.L. in April,
Meanwhile, civil war in Labor circles is
spreading in the electorate, and is, naturally,
being fanned by Liberal organisers in their
party interests. In fact, Party and Party
interests are the first and last consideration.
To provide for
outlay on public
works and help
carry unemployed
over the difficult
times that lie
ahead, Victorian
municipal coun-
cils are borrowing
just on half a
million. The inter-
est on this —
£22,ooo—will be
a regular annual
°harge for Hea-
ven knows how
long, and the debt
itself will pass on
to poor old pos-
terity. All except
£12,000 o f it.
That much is
being lent to tw r o
moderately honest
councils. But even
they are not
going to repay in
any rash fashion.
They will do it
in 50 years —say,
25 years after the culvert has gone to wreck
and the spoon drain has been torn up and
the loan isn’t represented by anything. The
others don’t offer to repay in even 100 years..
Thus fat-stock salesman R. M. Pitt before
the N.S.W. Necessary Commodities Control
Commission last week in Sydney, where
mutton chops were then selling at lOd. and
lid. per lb.: —
In bis opinion there must be at least half a million
carcases of mutton stored in Sydney, Melbourne and
Queensland stores, which they could not ship away, as
there was no refrigerating space available. .. .If they
could not ship the meat away from Australia, it
would have to be boiled down and the price of stock
would go down in consequence. “It would pay the
growers to draft out the percentage which was above
the ordinary requirements of the markets, and drive
the surplus stock to North or South Head and drown
them!” he added.
And when they had driven the “surplus”
stock over South Head into the sea, would
there be any room down there for the food-
destroyers in case the people decided to exer-
cise the sacred right of revolution and drive
them after their stock?
PLANTED!
The common or garden Freetectionist bird
fluttered into Minister for Customs Tudor’s
office the other day disguised as the Tanners’
Union. The burden of its song was Free-
trade in regard to the things it requires,
Protection in relation to things it supplies.
The chirrup included a request that the duty
on wattle bark should be removed. These
same tanners would be horrified if a sugges-
tion were made that the duty on leather
should be obliterated. Yet bootmakers and
saddlers who use leather are just as much
entitled to consideration as tanners who use
bark.
MY ARMY, OH, MY ARMY!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My army, oh, my army! The time I dreamed of
comes!
1 want to see your colors; I want to hear your
drums !
I heard them in my boyhood when all men's hearts
seemed cold;
I heard them as a Young Man —and I am growing
old!
My army, oh, my army! The signs are manifold!
My army, oh, my army! My army and my Queen!
I used to sing your battle songs when I was seven
teen!
They came to me from ages, they came from far and
near;
They came to me from Paris, they came to me from
Here!—
They came when I was marching with the Army of
the Rear.
My Queen’s dark eyes were flashing (oh, she was
younger then !) ;
My Queen’s Red Gap was redder than the reddest
blood of men!
My Queen marched like an Amazon, her anger mani-
fest
By dark hair darkly matted from a knife gash in
her breast
(For blood will flow where milk will not —her sisters
knew the rest).
My legions ne’er were listed, they had no need to be;
My army ne’er was trained in arms—’twas trained
in misery!
It took long years to mould it, but war could never
drown
The shuffling of my army’s feet in the hunger-
haunted town —
A little child was murdered, and so Tyranny went
down.
My army kept no order, my army kept no time ;
My army dug no trenches, yet died in dust and
slime;
Its troops were fiercely ignorant, as to the manner
born ;
Its clothes were rags and tatters, or patches worn
and torn —
Ah, me! It wore a uniform that I have often worn!
The faces of my army were ghastly as the dead ;
My army’s cause was Hunger, my army’s cry was
“Bread! ”
It called on God and Mary and Christ of Nazareth ;
It cried to kings and courtesans that fainted at its
breath —-
Its women beat their poor, flat breasts where babes
had starved to death.
My army! My army—l hear the sound of drums
Above the roar of battles —and, lo! my army comes !
Nor creed of man may stay it —nor war, nor
nation’s law—
The pikes go through the firing lines as pitchforks
go through straw —
Like pitchforks through the litter, while empires
stand in awe.
N.s.w.

BILIOUSNESS
AND INDIGESTION KEPT AWAY BY
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
Mrs. E. A. Webb, of Bent Street,
Katoomba, N.S.W., writes“ For the past
10 years I have been taking Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills regularly, and find they
are splendid for keeping me free from incll '
gestion and biliousness. I usually take a
dose once a week. Prior to using these pit s
I tried other medicines, but none, or tnem
were as satisfactory as Dr. Morse s Indian
Root Pills. Mv husband and daughter also
take them; in fact, they are our family
medicine, and we are never without a p°
in the house. You have my full permission
to use this for advertising purposes.

used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root I ills for J ea »
and are still finding them benefits! as a
family remedy.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
Form was to the fore at Caulfield last
Saturday when Brattle, Philio and Amata filled the
places for the Oakleigh Plate sprint. In the absence
of Woorak all three of these slippery ones were
backed at anything between s’s and 10’s, and Brattle
(8-st. 111 b.) was the best handicapped of the trio. The
mare’s quick get-away and straight going disposition
will give her a good sporting chance in the New-
market at Flemington ; but a 101 b. penalty brings
her weight up to 9st. lib. The chances are that the
actual winner of the Newmarket will be found in
, the Futurity Stakes field this week.
Several of the Australian Cup possibles
ran in one or other event last Saturday. Nothing
else shaped nearly so promisingly as Lempriere, the
American-bred gelding that won the Bond Cup (12
furlongs) with the proverbial ton in hand. Lem-
priere is a 6-year-old, with a record that suggests
unsoundness in his limbs. He ran only twice as a
4-year-old in the company of jumpers ; last season he
raced not at all; but this season he won three
jumpers’ flat races before doing the Bond Cup trick.
If Sir Solo or any of the others that finished nowhere
to Lempriere on Saturday are going to beat him in
the Australian Cup. the reversal of form will be
very marked. The ’Murkan gee was let in at 6st.
111 b., and a half-stone penalty will make no differ-
ence to speak of.
Land of Song came to public light on Satur-
day and fully corroborated the allegations of rumor.
A smashing fine horse to look at, the imported
4-year-old (who is younger than those bred to Aus-
tralian time) proved too good for Mountain Knight,
Traquette and Jolly Beggar at w.f.a. And this when
he is still short of work. Seeing that he covered the
nine furlongs in record time, and is bound to be all
the better for his hard race and subsequent train-
ing gallops, he should have no trouble in beating all
the top weights for the Futurity Stakes. A 31b.
penalty brings his burden up to 9st. 101 b., which,
after all, is 81b. less than Maltine carried when she
nearly beat Comedy King (6st. 71b.) for the same
race. The most apparent of the other possibles for
the Futurity are Gigandra (9st. 81b.), Brattle (9st.
71b.), Woorak (9st. 41b.), Traquette (9st. 31b.) and
the light weights Baverstock (6st. 121 b.) and Clash
of Steel (6st. 71b.). If either of the last named can
beat Land of Song and wild Woorak in a fairly-
run race next Saturday, he will look a pretty good
thing for the Newmarket a week later. This scribe
fancies the two strangers, Song and Steel, with a
preference for the heavy weight. Ilis form is already
proved. Clash of Steel goes well on the track, and
is well-backed for the Newmarket, but to win the
Futurity he will need to be better than Comedy
King was five years ago, or Sir Foote was when
Wakeful -failed to give him 451 b.
Wakeful, who lias not proved a brilliant
success at the stud thus far, will be represented in
the autumn sprints by Baverstock, if the colt stands
his preparation. Baverstock is sired by Malster.
Blairgour, a previous son of Wakeful that threatened
to make a great name as a flier, was gotten by Wal-
lace. Blairgour was a popular idol for a fortnight. After
winning the Oakleigh Plate and the Futurity Stakes
he started as a dead cert, for the Newmarket and
appeared to be winning easily, then suddenly shut
up. After that he was always a quitter. Neither
Wakeful nor La Carabine, the two wonderful mares of
12 to 15 years ago, have transmitted their pluck and
stamina to their offspring. Their vital strength was
mostly exhausted on the turf. They remained too
long in training. Famous old racers make com-
paratively feeble parents, as a rule. Look at Trafal-
gar. After being put to the stud the tired champion
was sent back to Flemington with the idea of getting
some races out of him. Studding was not his forte.
S.A. Tattersall’s Club had a weird experi-
ence on renewing its racing at the “people's course”
on the Adelaide park lands —the Adelaide Racing
Club’s course. For years it raced there, but latterly
it has patronised the Jockey Club’s track at Mor-
T hettville. The Act that regulates racing dates from
1888, and limits the number of racing days on any
one track to 12 in the year. Each of the two big
metropolitan clubs takes seven only, and after keep-
ing one for the Hunt Club, ;he S.A.J.C. can give
Tattersall’s only four. As it already uses that num-
ber of days the first of some extra ones it has
planned had to be at Victoria Park. This is just as
good a course as Morphettville in a general way, but
has not had the same luck when bored for water. Also,
the free Flat it has to maintain under its lease from
the Citv Corporation naturally gets crowded ; and
as the Flat is due west of the enclosures, and as there
was a strong west wind blowdng that day, “it was
only at odd. times that the horses could be distin-
guished,’’ the newspapers say plaintively.
At its Easter meeting the A. J.C. will lavish
£30,450 ii' prize money snread over 24 events. The
winner of Sydney Cup will lift £5OOO.
January 31 concluded the first half of the
Australian racing season, and the list of winning
sires for that was headed by Malster with
46 winners of 99 races, representing stakes to the
value of £15,691. Wallace was second. His descend-
ants, though they won only 23 races, brought in
£11,248, a total very largely helped by Kings-
burgh’s Melbourne Cup. Lina ere, whose family
accounted for £10,367, was third. No other sire
was responsible for ten thousand.
A couple of racing records were recently
clipped. Haystoii’s* win in the Launceston Cup re-
duced the Tasmanian mile-and-a-half time to 2min.
34-Uec. ; while Musket King, in the Sandgate Cup,
cut down the Queensland nine-furlong record to lmin.
53sec. Neither is an Australian record, but both
show an approach to the best in the other States.
Onkaparinga Racing Club (S.A.) is this
year reducing the prize-monev for the Great Eastern
Steeplechase, but the race will still be worth £lOOO,
as in 1913. ■ Secretary Von Doussa is still deter-
mined, nevertheless, that it shall yet be a 2000sovs.
event. Half the net profit on this year’s meeting will
be handed over to Lady Galway’s Belgian Relief
Fund.
Spearmint. Carbine’s great son, finished
fourth o.i the winning sires' list for 1914 in the Cold
Country with £16.532. The best of his descendants
was The Curragh, who won £6745.
“Quill”: The most futile things in the
world are these daily-paper “Training Notes.” For
instance, one reads that Alwayslast ran six furlongs
at Caulfield in lmin. 21sec., that Chasem covered the
same distance in lmin. 19see., that Brokenwind accom-
plished the journey in lmin. 18sec., and One-Eye
beat Ilardmouth in lmin. 17sec—from which some
fatuous punter gathers that One-eye wiped out every-
thing on the track, and immediately rushes off to
Ikey. No mention of weights, nor method of starting,
nor the manner of riding. The facts may be that
One-eye was ridden by a light boy ; that Hardmouth
carried a welter; that Brokenwind ran the first two
furlongs quite leisurely ; and that Alwayslast did the
best gallop of the lot, since the unreliable moke was
taken from a standing start, was laden with a big
lad and heavy plates, and not shifted along in earnest
until a furlong and a half from home. It is the same
for all distances, times and horses prior to every big
race meeting. I had a long bet once about a prad at
Flemington. It became favorite. Three days before
the race the papers announced that Brassle (my nag)
had licked Rassle over a mile and a half. Great rush
of lunatics to support Brassle. As a matter of cold
truth, Brassle just beat Rassle in the gallop, but was
receiving 301 b. weight, and the latter ran in plates.
As Rassle was weighted in the race at 141 b. worse
than the other, and finished under a pull all the way
down the straight, the result of the flutter was all
in her favor. Of course she won three days 'after,
the ridiculous Brassle finished in the ruck, and
because the “training notes” were done by a tele-
graph post, we all fell in up to our necks.
* * * *
Another pellet to stir np the wowser and
make him leap at the end of his chain. Perth’s
Police Commissioner, in his annual report, declares
that the totalisator is the least harmful form of
betting patronised by the public. Believing that
betting cannot be entirely suppressed, he reckons its
best regulator is the machine. This is a mere piece
of common intelligence; but it will taste sour to
the wowser and the political (or private) grafter.
Joseph Bennett, who died at Stockton
(N.S.W.) the other day, was a younger brother
of John Bennett, well known in the old theatrical
world of Sydney and in connection with Rosehill and
Brush Farm racecourse. Joe Bennett was associated
with the Auckland Stud Co., which in the late ’7o's
imported Musket to Maoriland, and was interested in
the turf for manv years in N. S. Wales and Victoria.
T. J. THOMPSON ,
a promising young
bowler from Strath-
field (N.S.W.).
Sydney golfers last week dropped into line
with the other sporting bodies and decided on a
general lay-off while a head is being put on the
patron of the Almighty. Competitions will be
shelved, ditto the country carnival, and delegates to
the N.S.W. Council have instructions to vote for
cancellation of the Ma State championships. In
fact, golfers have locked the door and hung out the
sign: “Gone on urgent business. Return as soon as
possible.” Oarsmen are also getting on to this
urgent business, and the inter-State eight-oar race
and the sculling championship (set down for "deci-
sion at Brisbane in May) have been declared off
until May, 1916, at least.
In the Sheffield Shield matches Bardsley
headed the batting averages for the holders —N. S.
Wales. lie had eight strikes, was once not out, made
103 as his best score, and 334 as his total, and
finished with an average of 47. Following him were
11. Cranney (two matches), 33; L. Best (one match),
31. The other 16 men who played in the games tail
down to J. Flynn (one match), with an average of
3, which is not so much an average as an eclipse.
C. Kelleway (four matches) stands at 26; J. M.
Taylor (four matches), 24;. C. G. Macartney (two
matches), 22. In bowling F. M. Farrar (one match)
heads the list with two for 22, which doesn’t count.
R. B. Minnett (two matches) comes second with 13
for 157, an average of 12 ! then L. Best, one for 14 ;
L. A. Minnett (one match), five for 82 ; A. A. Mailey
(one), eight for 134. Kelleway took 13 for 318
(average, 24).
"Bails”: The Shield averages reflect the
low standard of the season's batting. In ' the
N.S.W. bunch Bardsley's average of 47 is moderate ;
that of the rest is painful. Ryder, Park and Baring,
for Victoria, each made over 200. Park made one
century, but the figures generally are uninspiring.
A couple of not-outs g-ave Ryder an average of 66 ;
the rest straggled down to Brown, at the bottom,
who made six in four attempts. S. Australians
Pellew and Steele each aggregated over 200, and
Steele made one century. There is one match yet
to go (S.A. v. Vic.), but the hope of seeing the
average improved isn’t rosy. * Altogether, the season
has been a dreary one.
Leading teams in N. S. Wales first-grade
cricket competition: North Sydney, with a count-up
of 66.6, first; Western Suburbs, 64.5, second;
Waverley, 62.5 third. The leaders were beaten on
Saturday for the first time this season. Western
Suburbs did the damage, through Murray (four for
21), and Dupain (four for 30). Seven of the men
from over the water made single-figure scores, of
which the highest was eight.
The most striking, even paralysing, feat in first-
grade cricket at Sydney on Saturday was Kelleway’s
eight wickets for seven runs. He was practically
unplayable for Glebe against Paddington, and the
rattle of falling timber was like the sound of shingles
being scattered by a cyclone. Not a Paddington man
could scrape together more than eight runs ; Sundries
was the only double-figure scorer. The match, which,
considering his great work with ball and bat (he
scored 138 on the previous Saturday), may be
termed “Kelleway’s match,” was won by Glebe by
an innings and 67 runs.
There were two three-figure scores in the first-
grade games at Sydne.v—l23 not out by Merchant
for Balmain against Middle Harbor, and 159 by
Macartney for Gordon against Waverley. The latter
innings was one of the best Macartney has ever
played. All bowling looked alike to him ; for 95
minutes he sent it on its way rejoicing. Five times
he walloped the ball over the six-run boundary mark.
Eventually he was caught. As a bright and shining
illustration of how a batsman can shake life into
the bones of cricket, Macartney’s innings at Chats-
wood Oval is marked “Exhibit A.” Merchant’s play
(110 minutes) was also an exhilarating sample of
an all-but lost art. He, too, had five sixers in his
collection.

With only two more rounds to be played
in Vic. pennant cricket, before the finals, the M.C.C.
looks to have a mortgage on the calico. It boasts
14 out of a possible 24 points; P’ran comes next
with 10 ; East owns eight, St. liilda five, and ’Wood,
North and ’Roy two each. The rest are minus. Of
its eight games M.C.C. won two outright, and five
on the first innings. It lost for the first time on
Saturday week ; but it had three inter-Staters away,
while P’ran, its conqueror, had only one.
“Rangan” : Bananaland’s cricket match
against Victoria developed into a farce. Finding
itself hopelessly outclassed the home team started to
play the fool. Even the scoring-board joined the
idiotic conspiracy, with the result that the mug
batsmen of the team figured as Trumper, Bardsley,
etc. The few keen followers of cricket in Brisbane
went away disgusted. Before Armstrong left,
Bananaland’s cricket bosses asked how it was they
were always shut out of the Sheffield Shield competi-
tion. Armstrong politely murmured something about
being “too far away.” Incidentally, Bananaland’s
team was,- as usual, chosen solely from metropolitan
clubs. And, as if to poke borak at that absurd
policy, it had to stand up against the bowling of
ex-Queenslander Ironmonger, the man who was never
fit for the Bananaland team because he didn’t happen
to live in Brisbane.
* * * *
The best; cricket in the recent contests in
Maoriland for the Plunket Shield was shown by a
i.w man—A. W. Thomas, of Canterbury. He isn’t
young, for he has been pounding on the door lead-
ing to rep. cricket for years, but the selectors have
been deaf. At the last minute he was thrown into a
vacancy in the Canterbury team that went to Auck-
land. Even then, although a good bowler, for some
unexplained reason he was not given a chance to
pancake Auckland’s first innings. But, with the bat,
going in eighth, he ran up 41 by beautiful cricket
when the score was a byword. Maybe it was for this
that, in Auckland’s second innings, he was handed
the ball and urged to do his worst. This is what he
did: 48 overs, 20 maidens, eight wickets for 99 runs.
In Canterbury’s second go with the wood, when the
team was set the task of making 291 on the last
day to save the Shield, Thomas again went in eighth
and made a useful 20.
Auckland (MX.) hopes it hns unearthed
a Trumper in a 16-year-old schoolboy named Dacre.
During the Christmas holidays he was given a place
in North Shore’s first-grade team, and smote the
best bowling in Auckland to the four winds. Hav-
ing nothing half so important to do he played for a
first-grade team in the mid-week competition and
continued to do surprising things. One week,
towards the end of January he banged up 196 (not
out) on the Wednesday, and followed that with
188 for North Shore on the Saturday. Tin's totalled
384 runs off one bat in first-grade cricket in a week,
which is a record for Maoriland. So far he has
made over 800 runs in first-grade cricket this year
and, with school matches added, has amassed over
1800 runs since the season opened. His average is
getting on towards 200. The boy didn’t get into
the Auckland reps., but that wasn’t his fault. He
tried hard enough.
F. S. Jackson, for many years captain of
the Yorkshire County Cricket Club and of the All-
England Eleven, has found a place in the House of
Commons. He was the other day elected unopposed,
in accordance with the British Parliamentary truce,
to a Unionist seat.
Ranji. has been given the rank of major at
the Front.
For the disturbance at Sydney Stadium
on Saturday night to decide the heavyweight cham-
pionship of the continent Ben Doyle, the challenger,
stepped into the ring at 14st. lib. with the grave
deliberation of an elderly merchant about to take his
morning tub. Dave Smith weighed in at list. 91b.
One was of middle age, with nice, comfortable layers
of fat on back, chest and loins and a very decided
bingy ; the other, young, lithe, athletic. The methods
of the men were wholly dissimilar, too. Doyle lum-
bered heavily round after an opponent who for the
greater part of the time was to him as elusive as a
shadow. Smith, after learning wisdom from several
hefty swipes in the- opening rounds, bounced like a
rubber ball upon the enemv, smote heavily at head
and jaw and leaped speedily away again before the
pile-driver fell. Such blows as Doyle, before com-
mencing to melt, actually did deliver were forceful
reminders to Smith of what awaited delay. One in
the fourth round shook the champion badly. But
from thence onward there was only one in it, and
that wasn’t Doyle.
Smith was really meeting a man who could neither
box him nor hit him, unless assisted by good luck.
But the possibility of devastation was there right up
to the last, and Smith never forgot it. Doyle showed
a grim, imperturbable courage all through. Over the
last half of the journey he received severe punishment.
He took it without a flinch. His hard, rock-like
countenance never altered in expression, and though
in the final half dozen rounds he was very, very tired,
with one eye out of sight and the other in mourning’
he went towards his man with a resolution undimmed.
Doyle’s grit and stamina would probably have carried
him a long way further, but the spectacle could have
no attractions. Before the end arrived he had become
a mere chopping block, and most of the onlookers
were relieved when Baker softly placed a hand tm
the head of Smith. There was perhaps as much
applause for the beaten man as for the winner, who
had given a fine display of fast, scientific work with
hands and feet.
The latest tracking of Jack Johnson locates
him at Buenos Ayres, allegedly getting ready to meet
Sam McVea (Silence!) and Jess Willard, the former
at Havana and the latter in Mexico, where the inhabi-
tants take turn about in being President. Two fights
with men of lesser tonnage in Buenos Ayres were also
on the bill. Willard’s backers (and they include good
judges like Jim Jeffries and Barney Oldfield) are so
anxious to get Johnson inside the ropes that they
have put up £2OOO as a wager on the result. They
argue that Johnson has never been up against a big
man (Willard is 6ft. 7in. in height), that he has fought
to the top over the bodies of small men like Ketchel,
Burns and Flynn (Jeffries doesn’t count), and that a
man of Willard’s build and power would put the
darkey out of the business. They don’t mention the
difference in age between the two. Johnson is 37,
Willard is 28. Anyhow, the fight looks a longer way
off than March, for which it is alleged to be booked.

Fanny Dnrack, of N. S. Wales, undercut
another record (for women) on Saturday, at New-
castle, when she went over the 200yds. course In
2min. 39lsec. The time was 17 7-10 sec. better than
the world’s previous best, recorded to Miss E,
Mackay, on September 11, 1907, at Burnley Baths,
England.

From Brisbane round the coast to Mel-
bourne the Hawaiian swimmer, Duke Kahanainoktl,
has now shown the consistency of his speed, Oil
Saturday at the Melbourne Swimming Club's annual
tests he won the 100yds. championship in lmirt.
1 3-ssec. —the exact time he took to throw 100
metres of Stockholm water behind him when he
established the world’s record for that distance in
1912. On Saturday he had nothing to speed him
up, or the time Would have been less. He also won
the 100 metres invitation race, in lmin. 1 3-ssec.,
after a great struggle with Hay, of N. S. Wales ; and
on Monday night he got away with the 220yds. invi-
tation race in 2min. 48sec., and, with Cunha, the
relay handicap. Kahanamoku and Cunha go on to
Maoriland, where a programme has been arranged for
them that might have been less strenuous. Pros,
couldn’t have been asked to work so hard.
Two challenges to swim in aid of patriotic
funds have ended in hot air. First, “Billy” Long-
worth, who was ill when the furlong championship
was decided at Sydney, invited Kahanamoku to a
flutter over 220yds., but the Duke and his party
were too busy or something. Then Beaurepaire
threw a defiance at Longworth, but the gage had to
lie unlifted because the Victorian is regarded as a
sort of semi-professional. The question of Beaure-
paire’s status was down for decision at the Inter-
national Swimming Conference at Budapest in May ;
but the war took precedence, and it looks as if the
Australasian ruling that Beaurepaire is a professional
will have to stand.

With one regatta yet to be decided
this season, Enterprise Rowing Club has estab-
lished such a lead in the pursuit of the N.S.W.
Senior Pennant that the destination of the bauble
is as fixed as the roots of sin. On Saturday, at the
clubs’ own regatta, its colors were brought home
first in the senior fours, maiden eights and handicap
sculls. In points for the Pennant Enterprise has
scored more than the other six clubs put together.
At an Auckland (M.L.) carnival recently
Miss D. Farquhar, a local girl, slipped through 100
yards of water in 83 4-ssee.. which is a Maoriland
record for the sex, and more than 17sec. behind
the Australian best.
A curious dispute has entered into Syd-
ney’s bowling competition. In a match between
Waverley and Chatswood the former was one up;
two rinks finished, and one to go. ■ When the 25th
head was being played the Waverley men found they
were heading the wrong way, i.e., the Jack was at
the end of the rink played to when the heads bore
even numbers. There were three possible explanations:
(1) The scorers had reckoned one head twice; (2)
they had omitted to record one played; (3) the
quality of the afternoon-tea. The umpire gave the
problem up and ordered another head, in which
Chatswood scored two and won. Waverley appealed
to the Pennant Committee, which body upheld the
appeal and gave the match against Chatswood.
Now, the argument rageth like the heathen and the
brotherhood of man abideth not.
* * -*- *
Dunedin (M.L.) indulged in what was
known as an “Elderly Bowlers’ Day” recently, when
ancient trundlers (all under 65 were barred as being
mere boys) gathered to play rink matches and
deplore the quality of whuskv as compared with that
of the good old days. In one rink the ages of the
four players totalled 330 years. The oldest bowler
present was 89, and he showed the youngsters a
surpisingly good game.
The accident to airman M. Marduel at
Centennial Park (Sydney) last week happened at a
most unfortunate time. A match from Sydney to
Penrith between Delfosse Badgery (Australia) and
Marduel (France) had reached the “fixing-up” stage ;
but the smash knocked it on the head. Another to
catch the flying “fever” again is “Billy” Hart, who
defeated Stone in the only flying race ever seen in
N.S.W. —from Svdney to Parramatta, a few years
back. Though he still suffers from his bad spill
Hart intends to join in if the flying matches_get any
further than “bluff” stage. #
“Coot” : One Melbourne club of athletes,
at any rate, has provided its quota of recruits. The
Brighton Scotchbyterian Lacrosse Club, which had
three teams playing last season, has been responsi-
ble for 24 volunteers, equal to two teams. It
has lost its captain, vice-captain, secretary and dele-
gates. With its depleted ranks it perhaps won’t be
able to scrape up a team for local play next season,
but it should be able to provide the champion
lacrosse team at the Pyramids.
One of the most strenuous motor-car con-
tests ever held was a recent 696 miles’ race from
Los Angeles to Phoenix (U.S.), over hills and dales,
wit l a desert or two thrown in, and rivers, precipices
and sundries as a side-line. Snow, sleet and heavy
rain were other parts of the scenery. That great and
fearless motorist, Barney Oldfield, aboard a Stutz car,
was the winner. He averaged 30 miles an hour.

“Kodak”: Almost anyone will be able to
write impressively about the war when I
bring out the work I am compiling. A few
extracts: —
USEFUL PHRASES FOR LEADER-WRITERS.
This is a war of attrition —exhaustion —petrol—
machines —any old thing you can think of.
Gallantly preserved the best traditions of the
race.
To the last breath of man and horse.
The silver bullet must win the final victory.
Germany's contempt for a scrap of paper will yet
cost it (Insert here what it will cost.)
The demon of Prussian militarism must be crushed
for ever. (Also, the dream of world dominion and
the Prussian military caste.)
We are not fighting the German people. We are
fighting (Insert here what we are fighting.)
The venerable Emperor Franz Joseph, at the end
of his long and stormy reign, sees (Insert here
what he sees.)
It has been wittily said that if Austria had not
existed it would have been necessary to invent her.
Bismarck dreaded a war on two fronts.
But Germany has rattled the sabre once too
often.
POINTS TO REMEMBER.
Kaiser William has a withered arm and a sore
ear. Cancer in the family. Allowable to hint that
he is insane.
The Crown Prince an ass. Made a bad mess of
things near Verdun. Always having rows with his
dad.
Von Kluck most advertised German general.
Kaiser told him to “walk over General French’s
contemptible little army.” Couldn’t.
German mothers frighten children when naughty
by telling them the Cossacks will get them. Cos-
sacks not cruel : quite a mistake.
Germans always routed with appalling slaughter.
Subsequently it makes British soldiers sick to look
at the heaps of dead. .
Adjectives to use in connection with German or
Austrian troops: Shaken, half-starved, mere boys, ill-
conditioned, shattered, broken, defeated.
Adjectives for Allies: Brilliant, dashing, cheerful,
eager, triumphant. They have also established a
moral ascendancy.

pose, be published in the spring. Everything

“Copy Boy” : One result of the invasion
of Belgium is that what was the oldest news-
paper in Europe lias disappeared. This was
the Nieuwe Typing hen, founded in Ant-
werp in 1605 and printed in Flemish up to
the time of the Hog's arrival. Belgium has
now but two papers left, and both are being
printed in London; before the war it had
2023.
According to latest statistics, the United
States are the most newspapered country in
the world. The dailies number 2472, the
weeklies 16,269, and the monthlies 6537.
The aggregate circulation —certified. no
doubt, by the most highly-qualified Yankee
canvasser —is 59 millions. The U.s. have
one newspaper for every 4100 of the popula-
tion ; England one for every 4700; France
one for every 5900; and Germany one for
every 7800.

“Mil”: Re “E.D.’s” par. (B. 28/1/T5)
that the parsons and other amateurs at the
“front” are undercutting the work of Cap-
tain Bean, the Commonwealth’s official
correspondent. Expense doesn’t come into
the question. The Commonwealth seeks no
profit, so that a first-class daily could get
all Bean’s work for £6O a year or there-
abouts. But the papers are not taking it
even at that figure, simply because even an
Australian daily doesn’t like to print the
“special correspondence” which is being
published also by its reptile contemporary.
Furthermore, Bean’s stuff so far is mere
reporter’s work, and no two papers in the
one city can afford to duplicate on that.
“P.X.” : In this campaign to induce Aus-
tralia to give preference to Australian goods,
what are the newspapers doing? I mean
on their business side. The foreign ad. is
mostly regarded as a stand-by in Australia,
and is often taken at a price which the boss
wouldn’t look at if offered by a local trades-
man. Further, after booming the foreign
goods at a lower price than that at which
they will consent to give home goods a lift,
country papers often use the “foreign” block
as a handy fill-up when matter is short.
They would explode with indignation if you
suggested that, matter being short, the local
tinsmith should get a free insertion of his ad.
THE DIRTY POET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Grimy as some Old Master, void of shame,
With linen black as Hell,
lie stood and smirked within the doorway’s frame,
For he had songs to sell.
Oh, he was dirty ! and the sweat ran down
And gemmed his stubbled chin;
His clothes held dust of all the dirty town;
He smelt hot—hot as sin.
He stood a moment framed within my door
Like some Old Master, then
Vanished ! 1 cursed his sweat-drops on the floor
And freely breathed again....
Next day again the singer ambled in,
His face was clean and bright!
Someone had found that human violin
And washed if overnight!
No more as some Old Master framed in oak
Did he appeal to me 1
He was a decent Ordinary Bloke!
I eyed him carelessly.
His songs somehow had lost their mellow tone
And seemed to rasp and squeak;
1 told him sadly, with an inward groan:
“Get dirty—call next week!”
So some near day, clothed in his singing grime,
Unsliaved, with greenish grin,
He’ll call on me, and I will buy his rhyme,
And he will smell like sin.

THE history of the piano industry in Australia is a record of
a long and continuous struggle against clever and unscrupulous
German methods. The strong anti-German feeling engendered
by the present war has not dictated the attitude of Australian piano
manufacturers, whose interests lie now, but no more than they have
always done, absolutely parallel with the advance of the British
Empire, and the victory of the Allies in Europe.
The production of pianos in Australia has afforded employment
to many hundreds of highly-skilled and highly-paid Australian
craftsmen; has assisted in the development of other Australian
industries, both primary and secondary, but has in no way contributed
to the building of German Dreadnoughts, the equipment of German
soldiers, nor the purchase of the shells and bullets to shoot down our
soldiers.
Beale & Co. Ltd. are the founders of piano manufacture in
Australia. The business was established over 18 years ago by its
present controlling Director, Mr. O. C. Beale (born at Mount Mellick,
Oueen County, Ireland) ; the Directors and Managers throughout
the business are also descendants of British families for many
generations; the whole of the capital employed is entirely Australian,
and the few necessary supplies for the factories are Australian or
from the countries of the Allies.
Your personal judgment of Beale Pianos and Beale Playei-
Pianos is sought, and we will demonstrate their superiority fully.

There’s No Humbug about
the “B0YPR00F” Watch.
This watch is sold for what it. is—a good, serviceable little
timekeeper at a very low price. We do not pretend that the
movement is equal to a watch costing thrice the price or
-more, but —we do say this: “If you or your boy need -a watch
- which will give many years of service—keep accurate time year
in, year out —and will not need patching up every week or so—
you cafinot go wrong with the “BOYPROOF.”
Sec Kow well tHe
Movement is protected
against prying fingers.
The simple, trustworthy movement is com-
pletely enclosed at the back, and. whilst
protecting against dust, also foils the
.attempts of a boy to “stir up the works
with a pin.” We have sold thousands of
these watches in Australia, and have
received many expressions of satisfaction
from purchasers.

THE BEST FOR OVER 200 YEARS,
We are aware of the large number of
makers that claim recognition for the
Australian musical public —but they are
either German or French Pianos,
A great revival has recently taken place
in England in favor of THE BRITISH-
MADE PIANO, of which The "Broad-
wood n holds the highest place for quality
of construction and tone.
For over 200 years “Broadwoods” have
been recognised as the finest British Pianos.
WE CAN HELP YOU TO PURCHASE
by allowing full value for your old piano
and the easiest of terms to pay off the balance
of the new one. Write for Catalogue,

Nemo : This is the beginning of your yarn
so far as we can decipher it: “During the shriek the
nursery commodious growl time been strolling in
the equitable pouch which has been grovelled every
day with the New Boy and his stalactites. The sur-
plus who wildcat in Asmodeus in the beanfeast have
wondered about the corridors, spitting, tearing, and
making infernal mullock of herself.” Here we give
it up.... Petra: The gentleman is dead. So far as
we know he had his leg bitten oft 1 by a lly and never
recovered. .. .Pig Island: No doubt an interesting
yarn ; but why didn’t you tell it to us in English ?
....Argument: The Defence Act provides that mem-
bers of the 0. M. Forces (including - Rifle Clubs, of
course) “shall not be required, unless they volun-
tarily' agree to do so, to serve beyond the limits of
the Commonwealth and those of any territory under
the authority of the Commonwealth.”. .. .Behellah:
All right; thanks. .. .Rangan: Showed it to the
Religious Editor, but he .knew it in its original
form. The o.f. had even more Worcester in it than
your version. ... Nadem: Try again, but don’t fake
so palpably... . Tiaki: Verses posted back January,
1915, to East Cape address. .. .B.D. (V.) : Almost
commonplace. Don’t tread on the heels of Brown-
ing.... E.B. (V.): “Oh, say what is that gentle
sound?” It is the sound of manuscript fluttering
into the basket.... F.W. (W.) : Poem only half-
manufactured.... Percy H.: Dead-level stuff. Have
shovelled out miles of verse just like it. .. .Pattie
S.: Not enough power or originality in your reply
to Lissauers “Hymn of Hate.” But what’s the
good of bothering about that sort of thing? When
a mad dog starts barking the only' effective reply is
to shoot the dog. . . .E.F.L.: “Kindly burn as usual.”
Why can’t you get it burnt nearer home? If the
Sydney City Council heard that Bananalanders were
sending stuff all the way to Sydney to be destroyed,
it would probably burst.... 8.W.C.: Vividly unin-
teresting- item....E.C. (M.L.) : It is original in a
wild, jagged way, but not good enough for print.
....P.P. (Q.): Too late. You spring like a drugged
snail when the dust of the express topic has settled
and the semaphore arm has swung back to the
horizontal. .. .Austin Biff: At any rate, in your quest
for love you seem to have got a deal of healthy
walking exercise.... Chris W.: You might have
called it “How She Got Out of Bed” instead of: —
Shack: Faint love-twitter. Take a lump of-
sugar and hop off the window-ledge. .. .E.M.W.:
Saved! We thought at first that your front name
was Edith, but a second glance reassured us —it was
Edwin. Well, Edwin can write indifferent verses
about housemaids’ beds if he wants to. But not
here J.I.M. : You have tied yourself up hopelessly
with a difficult metre... .William M.: Really don t
know where “The Outcast’’ is likely to get a bed. . . .
YV.II.McD.: A dull, unconvincing story, with an
unlikely corpse tied to its tail.... Gordon G.:
Please don’t re-write W. Shakspeare LL.
(V.) : Easy rhymes of no commercial value. Pre-
sume it is no use advising you to give it best or
make a serious effort to do better ?.... Thos. W.
(Q.) :We don’t want to hang on to the poem, but
where are the stamps for its return passage?....
Author of “Harbor Lights”: Yours is the most
devilishly illegible manuscript of the year. Bash!
....Errant: Your heart’s all right, but your verse
is rocky E.J.C. (Q.) : Dusty and worn-out idea.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CO I? RESPONDENTS.
H. Jones: No man named 11. Jones ever did a
good picture—at least, never in our experience. And
nothing you have done tends to upset the old con-
viction ... .K. Alexander: The picture of a horror
asking a public misery for a drink doesn’t appeal to
U5....G. I. Dane: The picture comes too late, and
it would have been no good even if it had come 20
years earlier. In fact, it would have been valueless
if Noah had drawn it. .. .Leonard Lely: Sketch
hardly up to the mark. As to your assurance that
the needle’s eye of Scripture wasn’t a real needle,
Low was perfectly cognisant of the fact. He was,
and still is, aware of that ancient gate of Jerusalem.
He also knows that the real Yankee doesn’t wear the
Stars and Stripes on his tall plug-hat, and that the
Englishman doesn’t invariably dress in two top-boots
and a bulldog. But an artist must be allowed some
“props,” as the theatrical manager calls them.....
.....John S.: Give it best. . . .F.A.C. : Old gag, and
it doesn’t apply. .. .Frank S.: It’s not sufficient to
wash and pray. You must also learn to draw....
E.J.S.: Too late. Better wait for the next war....
R.W.: It would not be fair to encourage y0u....
Woodicus: Did you do the wash-drawing with soup?
The outrage in line is, if anything, worse . than
the other A.W.8.: Hold on! By drawing for
the press you want, to earn a few shillings so that
you can learn how to draw. AVhy not be fair to
the press and earn the necessary shillings chopping
wood ?. .. . Racey S.: Gladly accept your assurance
that you are not a close relative of the Kaiser's.
The art ideas are not saleable, all the same. .. .
E.E. (Q.) : Labored jest and a dreadful drawing.
“The Old Soldier”
The system whereby officers on the regular-duty
roster get occasional intervals of five-days’ leave,
during which they are able to go home, is one of
the many innovations of this astonishing war. I
can remember Sebastopol and Delhi, and in neither
case could leave be given, not only on account of
distance, but on' account of the impossibility of
finding men to carry on the duty. In the British
army in the Crimea it was quite the usual thing
for infantry officers and men to be on duty two,
and sometimes three, nights running. They would
be on picquet or quarter-guard for the first day.
Coming off duty at sunrise, as soon as they got
back to camp they would be warned for a working party
in the trenches that night. When they got back to camp
next morning they would be lucky if they were not
turned out with the inlying picquets to repel a
sortie. With the armies now in the field it is all
different because, whatever else they are short of,
they have plenty of men, which means plenty of
reliefs. By the way, don’t let us talk so much of
the mud of this war. There never was a European
campaign without it. Trenches mean mud; and
happy the soldier who has plenty of it about him.
The Highlanders in the Crimea never got into the
trenches, and a terrible time they had in the winter
of ’54.
‘‘Yank’s” contribution :—-
The Women’s Suffrage movement is having mixed
history in Uncle Sam’s country. At the elections
held in November, 1914, a referendum on the ques-
tion was taken in Ohio, Missouri, Nebraska, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada and Montana. In
Montana, “equal suffrage’’ was gained by 1317
votes, and in Nevada by 3500. In all the other
States it was defeated. Women have the right
to vote for certain offices in 24 States, and there is
equal suffrage in 11 States. In Ohio, suffrage was de-
feated in 1912 by referendum. Another referendum,
taken at the 1914 elections, had the same result,
the voting being 719,061 against and 517,611 for.
Over 250,000 voters voted for or against the issue
just above or just below “Women’s Suffrage,’’ and
did not care sufficiently whether women voted or
not, to make one additional cross on the ballot.
Probably they were married men.
DAWN.
As I watched I seemed to see
Her eyelids drowsy flicker,
And a breezy sigh stole forth
As her bosom heaved the quicker;
White arms in misty drapery,
Out cast across her bed.
Withdrew with lingering motion
As she slowly raised her head.
Then were her eyes unveiled
Of tender and wondrous blue,
And the sigh had become a yawn
On a mouth of rosiest hue ;
With movement of purest delight
From fleecy covering she sprang,
And a simultaneous bird-song
From bushland trembled and rang ;
Warm flesh-tints flushing her o’er,
Poised for a moment she hung,
Then into her bath of gold
With an abandon of grace she flung.

Mr. J. Craven Burleigli,
My Dear Sir, —I thank you for your letter and offer.
I am very pleased to state that my hair has improved
wonderfully since I got the last supply of your
remedy. I am quite satisfied it is a True Hair
Grower. My scalp is now full of fine, silky hair and
I still have 2S boxes left, so I won’t need any more.
I am recommending your True Hair Grower to all

as I sent all the others to my friends and people, to
let them see how my hair has grown. You can
publish this if you please.—Yours truly,

I Was Bald
and Grew New Hair to its
present length in 40 Days.
MR. CRAVEN BURLEIGH .
(From a recent photograph.)
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business man.
My hair began to grow thin about the time I reached the
age of thirty. "When 1 had reached the age of thirty-five
•the top of my head was quite bald. I had considerable
pride, and sought for something to cause renewed growth.
I invested in every preparation that I could see or hear of,
and here let me say that not only did I try all the English
so-called restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many sover-
eigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came not. 1 had
given up the idea of ever growing hair again. One after-
noon, while enjoying a brief business respite by an Alpine
trip, I fell in with an old collegiate chemist, whose hair was
particularly plentiful. 1 jokingly remarked that 1 wished
he could spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led
him to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth, lie wrote out a for-
mula and suggested that I have a quantity of the compound
prepared. 1 did this a few days later. 1 was astonished
to see the hair coming forth after several applications, and
within six weeks my head was covered with a firm, yet
soft, growth of hair. Since then the hair on my head has
been as luxuriant as when in my school days. Having
arranged for the legal right to do so, I have for some time
been privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. 1 hold over one thousand letters from people who
have actually grown new hair through the medium of my
true hair-grower. I do not pretend to say it is the only
hair-grower in the world —1 am not interested in decrying
•others —but 1 do assert that it is the most reliable, and in
the end by far the cheapest.

John Craven Burleigh,
Dear Sir, —I have to thank you for (he grea
benefit I have received in using your True'Hair
Grower with great success. My hair has grown
splendid. I wish you could see it. I will have no
hesitation in recommending your True Hair Grower
to my friends and acquaintances. Thanking you
once again,—Yours truly, W. J. STOCKLEY,

Miss RITA IItJDSON (from a photo.).
Lintlesfarne, Burrawang, N. S. Wales
.Mr. .John Craven Burleigh,
Bear Sir, —I am enclosing herewith one of my
photographs, to give you some idea how my hair has
improved since using your True Hair Grower.
Before I commenced its use my hair was falling in
handfuls and I was also greatly troubled with
dandruff. However, I am glad to say that my hair
has now stopped falling, the dandruff has completely
been removed, and my hair has grown much thicker
and longer. My friends are astounded at the differ-
ence in my hair, so I have a splendid opportunity
of singing the praises of your wonderful preparation.
You can use this letter and my photograph in any
way you think fit, and you can rest assured that I
will do all I can to induce my friends and acquaint-
ances to give your treatment a trial.—Thanking you,
I am. yours truly, RITA HI'PSON.
New Preparation Causes Big Stir Among Hair Specialists.
Hair troubles, like many other diseases, have been wrongly diagnosed, and altogether misunderstood. The hair itself is not the thing to be treated, for the reason
that it is simply a product of the scalp, and wholly dependent upon its action. The scalp is the very soil in which the hair is produced, nurtured and grown, and it alone
should receive the attention if results are to be expected. It would do no earthly good to treat the stem of a plant with a view to making it grow and become more beautiful
—the soil in which the plant grows must be attended to. Therefore the scalp, in which the hair grows, must receive the attention if you are to expect it to grow and
become more beautiful.
Loss of hair is caused by the scalp drying up, or losing its supply of moisture or nutriment; when baldness occurs the scalp has simply lost all its nourishment, leaving-
nothing for the hair to feed upon (a plant, or even a tree, would die under similar conflations).
The natural thing to do in either case is to feed and replenish the soil or scalp, as the case may be, and your crop will grow and multiply as Nature intended it
should. '
My True Hair Grower has a most wonderful effect upon the hair glands and tissues of the scalp. It is the only remedy for the hair ever discovered that is simi-
lar to the natural foods or liquids of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and the hair soon shows the effects of its wonderfully exhilarating and life-p/roducing qualities.
My offer is a straightforward, honest proposition from a business man to sensible men and women. The merit of my TRITE HAIR GROWER is in the prepara-
tion itself, not in the advertising. If you will write to me I will send you a TRIAL BOX of the JOHN GRAVEN BURLEIGH TRUE HAIR GROWER. I make this
offer because I want YOU to know just what my True Hair Grower will do. I was bald ; it cured me, and it has cured thousands of others.

Cut out this coupon, send it with three; stamps to cover postage, and I will immediately post a trial box of my True Hair Grower.

It aids him in a hundred ways —for the cattle, for the sheep,
he finds Hycol indispensable. As a wash, as a preventive of
mange in the pens, the stalls, stables, everywhere. Hycol is the
“Vet” always to hand, and this accounts for its immense popularity
in the back blocks, where it is a friend indeed. Hycol should also be
used in the Farm House to prevent disease. Its wonderful properties
promote a perfect state of sanitation because it destroys all germ life.
Hycol is NON-POISONOUS, NON-IRRITANT, and is TWENTY TIMES
STRONGER as a germ-killer than Carbolic Acid.

"Deering" and "McCormick" Chain Grain Drive
—lt cannot change unless YOU change it.
MERE IT IS
—the much-talked-of Grain Sowing Device fitted to
all this season’s "Deering" and "McCormick" Drills.
It is the most simple, effective, and durable drive
ever made so simple that it cannot get out of order
so effective that it will sow the smallest quantity of
grain per acre with the utmost accuracy so durable
that it will last a lifetime.
Take a look at the accompanying cut and observe
the fewness of parts required to obtain the motion on
the grain shaft. The motion is obtained by means ot a
powerful chain, driven from a sprocket on the main axle to a sprocket on the
countershaft, thence by chain from the countershaft to
grain shaft. Simple and ample provision is made to enable the operator to at a
times keep the chains tight. Where a change in the quantity
is required, all that is necessary is to remove a cotter pin and replace the sprockets
on the grain and axle ends of the countershaft with the sprocke
greater or lesser quantity, as required.
It is a well-known fact that any turning inovement brought abootby_cham belt
absorbs the least amount of power, and further, that this drive positively eliminates
that tendency to slip, so common on spur gear wheel drives.
IIW- These features should prove of much interest to farmers, as they provide lighter draught, and
positively prevent any stoppage of feeding through the slipping of gears.
Not only does this new Grain Sowing Device sow the seed surely, but its simple construction sUll further
reduces the already tremendously low up-keep cost of " Peering" and "McCormick" Drills.

IN
BANANA LAND
“H.W.”: “ J.D.M.’s” yarn in a recent
Bulletin misstates “Bob” Philp’s early
experiences in Queensland. “Bob’s” father
had the first swimming baths here in Bris-
bane. In 1870 the lad was in Bright Bros.’
office (now Gibbs, Bright and Co.), and
remained there till James Burns invited him
up to Townsville. That was the start of
Burns, Philp and Co. —and incidentally also
of the Queensland Insurance Co. and three
or four island plantation and trading cos.
Passed in his checks a few days ago S. W.
Brooks, a Amteran journalist and old-time
Liberal politician of some tonnage. Origin-
ally a Fiji missioner, he came to Brisbane
in the early ’Bo’s, attached himself to the
Griffith party, and became a regular contri-
butor to the leading dailies. Bitterly opposed
to the Labor party, he drifted with his
leader Griffith into the ranks of Toryism
until his exit from political life. He was a
distinctly capable journalist and a man of
high personal integrity.
“Quill” thinks the climate of the South
must be terrible
One can hardly pick up a newspaper without
coming across a paragraph about a politician being
in urgent need of a holiday, or having already
rushed off somewhere to cool his aching brow.
Fisher has just come back from Maoriland, after
some vague, mysterious “mission,” and while there
loudly demanded the summoning of an Imperial Con-
ference at the most wildly inappropriate moment
for such a eorroboree that anyone could conceive.
Now Hughes has found the task of “investigating
cases of alleged trading with the enemy” so exhaust-
ing as to call for at least a month’s spell. As all
the investigating in these cases is done by police
and officers of the Crown Law Department, Hughes’s
labor has been to read the codified results of their
explorations and assent to the courts making further
investigation. State affairs in the South seem quite
as destructive to health as those of the Common-
wealth. Last year Carmichael was so run down by
having been Minister for Education in N. S. AVales
that he was compelled to tear himself away from
Australia completely and go to Europe. During the
last few months Holman, after arranging with Wade
to have “a truce,” found himself working so vio-
lently in connection with the scheme for erecting
calico humpies at Daceyville that he had to have
several rests from work of every kind except surf-
bathing and golf—especially rests from questions
about Norton Griffiths and Co. That he will find
another holiday needful before long is generally
believed certain. David Hall, having fallen over
himself 15 times while arranging the N.S.AV. wheat
seizure, confided to a reporter one morning that the
doctors had insisted on his going off for repairs, and
he forthwith hiked away to where Fisher had been.
Unfortunately for Davy, his days of furlough were
rudely interrupted by cable messages from Sydney
about Mr. Nick Mutton and Mr. Drew. Even the
Premier of little Tassy had to take a holiday lately
and go to Sydney to see if Holman could lend him
a cargo of wheat —a matter any other two wealthy
men would have fixed up by a short telegram. Also,
Bice, of S. Aus., has been up here finding out how
we run a hospital. I understand Bice was a country
blacksmith; and everybody knows the running of
hospitals is what country blacksmiths are specially
trained to. While Parliaments are in full blast the
politicians are continually whining about not having
time to attend to matters of administration. When
Parliaments are doing nothing, administrative detail,
proves so enervating that it has to be suddenly
dropped.
This must be near the record. Three men
at Brunette Downs (N.T.), where the
northern climate saps the energy, decided to
volunteer. They rode six days to Camoo-
weal, coached five more to .Cloncurry, trained
to Townsville, then caught the boat to Bris-
bane. The journey was over 2000 miles and
took about three weeks to complete.
No slouch of a litterateur is E. W. 11.
Fowles, Liberal M.L.C., of Brisbane. The
Queensland Department: of Public Instruc-
tion has just brought out a series of
Readers, and 17 specimens of English printed
in one number are signed boldly “E.W.H.F.”
In the same volume Walter Scott, Words-
worth, Longfellow and Henry Lawson are
represented by one specimen apiece. The
inference is obvious.
Two idyllic advts. from a Brisbane daily
which regards itself as quite respectable:—•
Advertiser, good income, desires meet young,
healthy, aboriginal half-caste girl, view matrimony.
, this office.
Advertiser, independent means, desires meet attrac-
tive colored girl, view marriage. , this office.
If these advts. mean what they probably do
mean, “this office” is being put to very base
uses.
ITEMS OF INTEREST.
ISAAC: “Der British scharged magnificently, and der Chermans paid dearly ”
SOLOMON (dreamily): “ Peautiful, peautiful !”
“A Field” : The recent gathering at Gossy-
pium Park of employers of aboriginal labor,
to protest against the Chief Protector’s order
that the blacks should receive more return
for their labor, leaves a queer taste. Were
an absolutely unbiassed person allowed to
investigate the employment of black labor in
the North, his finding must be that in 80
per cent, of cases the conditions savor very
strongly of slavery. One case in point. A
black, employed by certain timber-getters for
the past 16 years has from the beginning of
the term and up till now received no money
remuneration. He merely gets food and
clothes, yet he undoubtedly works far better
than any of those whose nigger he is. This
I emphatically state is not an isolated case.
There are many such. The present system
of “protecting” black brother is lamentable.
My own opinion is that he should be worked
on small State farms, under the control of
white (married) men in his home districts.
He would thereby become _ self-supporting
and probably revenue-producing. The com-
mon report re the uselessness of the abo. is a
canard. The black can and does do field work
wjiich, compares, favorably with that of the
average white. I myself employ no black
labor and don’t intend to, but I maintain
that those who do should be compelled to pay
a decent wagfe. Just now, when we’re all
bawling that Britons never shall be slaves, it
wouldn’t be a bad thing if we decided to
remove the taint of enslaving others.
African Daisies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is no peace where you are. When I
bought
Your scarlet tangle at the florist’s stall
It was a key to quiet ways I sought,
Some tranquil dreaming from your stems to
call.
And now the hush of humid vales you burn
And flout the vision wheresoe’er I turn!
You cling together in your passionate scorn
Of paler flowers, of blossoms gentler-eyed,
A hot unrest among your petals born.
All milder blooms, and sweeter, you deride;
A challenge from your orange heart is hurled,
Flaunting a fiercer love against the world !
I cannot think of pastures lush and green,
Of shady roads and misty, evening fields.
You conjure up a bare, sun-blistered scene —
A stony veldt your magic only yields.
Where one thin dole of shadow vainly tries
To hide a dead man’s baffled, bankrupt eyes!
A vulture swinging downwards to the plain
From quiv’ring sky-sweeps, scorched to
faded blue
By winds that have no memory of rain
To grasses that have long forgotten dew,
As o’er the far veldt edges, molten, dim,
The woman laughs.... who has forgotten
him !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 13, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The only thing that really stirred the
population this week was a warning from
the weather prognosticator, to the effect
that on Tuesday a cyclone would smite this
simple village. The announcement was
made in the midst of the wettest downpour
that has happened since the Oldest Inhabi-
tant settled here, and the townsfolk hurriedly
began to entrench themselves and erect
barricades. Fortunately the cyclone broke
its steering gear, and the meteorological
prophet issued a later communique to say
that it was agitating the ocean 150 miles
away, and as there wasn’t anyone on the
spot to deny it, we let it go at that.
In this State there are two separate sets
of patriotic funds. One, the Queensland
Patriotic Fund, is run by a public com-
mittee. The other is the Courier’s fund.
Both have done and are doing well, both are
serving the same charitable and patriotic
end, yet each eyes tlfe other in the same
loving way that two unintroduced dogs meet
over one bone.
In connection with the coming elections,
Lancelot Victor Wilkinson is causing some
asperity. Lancelot acceded to a hearty
request from himself that he should do
battle for the Liberal cause in North Bris-
bane, and, on the ground that he is first in
the field, refuses to come out and see if he
is the party’s desired champion. “Get your
blow in early” is Lancelot’s motto, so here
he is, blowing away, while other Liberal
candidates are merely scouting round to find
out what time the ’bus left.
The welcome-home to Mrs. Kingsbury was
a great success. The glad hand was extended
in the South Brisbane Town Hall, and its
heartiness was equalled only by its numer-
pusness. Amongst the gathering were
Mayoresses Allen (South Brisbane) and
Jenkinson (Brisbane), who made their last
official appearance. By the time this
appears in print, Thargomindah, Mrs. Kings-
bury will be preparing (Thursday evening)
to relate her experiences abroad, from the
platform of the Albert Hall, in aid of the
Belgian Fund.
When in England, Mrs. Kingsbury stayed
with her brother, Dr. Ham, who formerly
was Bananaland’s Health Commissioner, and
whp now is in charge of Netley Military
Hospital in England. Mrs. Kingsbury saw
many wounded soldiers there. Some of them
—fever patients mostly—made unprintable
remarks about the idiots who had sent them
home. They were “all right in the trenches,”
they said.
The mayoral furs have fallen upon Aid.
George Down (Brisbane) and Aid. Davey
(South Brisbane). As was the case last
year, neither of the new Mayoresses have
hitherto entered upon public life, so all
their joy is to come. Both have,, however,
worked hard for the Red Cross.
Dorothea Collins, last unmarried member
of the late Robert Collins family, was
quietly wedded to her cousin, Douglas
Fraser, at Tamrookum, last Wednesday.
Mrs. Simon Fraser, of Melbourne, is the
bridegroom’s mother. The Rev.. Mr. Max-
well, of Sandgate, 'secured the knot In the
drawing-room at Tamrookum., Evelyn
Taylor, of Belle Vue, all in pink, was the
solitary bridesmaid.. The newly-weds' are
likely to be a well-endowed pair, for Mun-
doolan, where Miss Jane Collins: rules at
present, goes to Douglas: Fraser later on,
under his uncle’s will.
Another wedding happened. on Wednes-
day in Toowoomba. The principals were
Carl Doyle, of The Corners, Nyngan
(N.S.W.), and Ivy Tate,, of Roma., Miss
Doyle, of Sydney, pretty Nell of
Roma, George Godsall, and one of. the
Toowoomba Wilcoxes helped the pair over
the hurdles.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Flinderino”: Add to the trophies: ini the
Quetta Memorial Church which Bishop
White is leaving (B. 11/2/’l5) a lifebuoy
and flag from the steamer Kanahooka, which
was lost in the Gulf of Carpentaria; a
couple of seats from the Volga, which came
to grief at Goode Island; and a marble
tablet bearing the names of the pearlers who
were drowned in March, 1899, when a
hurricane struck the North Queensland
pearling fleets and accounted for some 300
lives. It will, by the way, be 25 years; on
the 28th inst. since the Quetta struck Iter
big trouble.
A tribe whose gunyahs adorned the Russell
River had a queer method of trying
a supposed murderer. Some years ago>_ a
youthful binghi was accused of having
fatally speared an old man in the stomach.
To prove his innocence or guilt the body of
the departed blackfellow was disembowelled,
and his inwardness stretched between two
saplings. The wise men of the tribe then
put certain questions to the dreadful thing,
beseeching it to speak the truth and nothing
but the truth. They then retired to the bush
and did not return for one full hour. Had
the mush broken while they were away the
boy’s guilt would have been considered
proved. In this instance no breakaway
occurred, and the accused left the court
without a smudge on his escutcheon.
“D. Obo” (from Thursday Island) :
A beche-de-mer fisherman (white) reports that a
lot of the Yongala’s wreckage was washed up 200-odd
miles south of Thursday Island a few weeks hack
after a heavy blow. Japanese in his employ say
that the ship is in the vicinity of Townsville, and
that they have seen her masts at low tide. This
seems to he now an accepted fact amongst men
working round the coast after beche-de-mer. Further
inquiry ought to be made. We should know some-
thing more. All we know at present, in fact, is that
the vessel disappeared with all hands.
The lesson of how to smite the
Amalekites has borne a good crop of fruit
at the Methodist parsonage in Murgon. The
pilot there has three sons at the front (one
turning the other cheek to the adversary in
France and two looking for good deeds to do
in Egypt), two daughters with the Aus-
tralian Field Ambulance as nurses, and a
third who has volunteered. Also, if he can
get a license, the father threatens to himself
address some earnest bullets to William and
make a few pointed remarks with a bayonet.
“Bill Bowyang”: “J.C.M.” is glued to
the truth when he states (B. 7/1/T5) that
cocoanut-raising in North Queensland is
practically unexploited. Tens of thousands
of acres of suitable land is at present going
to waste. All the fringe of N.Q. is cocoanut
country, and the coastal islands offer ideal
conditions. The vegetable flourishes even in
beach sand, where very little else will grow.
It is a poor specimen of tree that yields less
than 50 nuts in a year; a good tree yields
a hundred or 4000 to the acre. Cultivated
trees, set wide apart, begin to yield as young
as four years of age. Crowded trees are
often 10 years old before they begin to
produce. Most of the South Sea cocoanuts
went to Europe before the war, and from
them was produced (among other things)
the “olive oil” that you are very liable to
buy if you don’t insist on having the Aus-
tralian article. Also, there was manu-
factured the grated and ground cocoanut
used for cooking purposes. I don't know
why we shouldn’t do the job of refining the
copra in Australia, but every importer in
the country could explain it off-hand.

The Danger of
CATARRH
The danger of breathing
ih germs is very real
and ever-present. The
peril is doubled if you
have Catarrh. The
moist, mucous - laden
surfaces most annoy-
ing in themselves—are
a most attractive breed-
ing place for the dan-
gerous, and often life-
destroying, germs of
Tonsilitis, Influenza and
Diphtheria, and, most
dreadful of all, CON-
SUMPTION !
Air-Passages of the Nose and Throat.
“ KAT-AP-AH ” Treatment helps Nature put
them in good working order, in which con-
dition it is impossible for Catarrh to exist.
You have Catarrh ! YOU can tell that by the
uncomfortable stuffiness in the nose, the constant
sniff, sniff, caused by mdist accumulations, the
difficulty of breathing, the persistent necessity of
clearing the throat by “hawking,” and the frequent
use of the handkerchief to blow the nose. Or
you may suffer from frontal headaches, your
hearing be affected, perhaps you have noises in
the head, sneeze frequently or awake with a
heavy, tired feeling. Do not live in danger
of Catarrh developing into something worse,
such as Deafness, Asthma, Catarrh of the
Stomach, or Consumption.
Free to Sufferers.
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to a sample bottle of
Kat-ar-ah ’ Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic com-
pound of certain valuable medicaments, and is supremely bene-
ficial in its influence on the mucous membrane. It has a
distinctly soothing, healing and aero-sanative effect, sufficient
to disintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous secretions.
"Kat-ar-ah ” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing
effects are simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement
immediately after beginning its use. It quickly takes up its
work of killing the disease germs, of' minimising, and eventually
stopping, the discomforting mucous discharges in the nose and
throat—mucous that is finding its way into your stomach and
poisoning your system.
You are invited to send at once for a FREE TRIAL BOTTLE
of ‘‘Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant and a copy of my new and wonder-
fally-interesting Booklet, telling how to get rid of this terrible
scourge. Write to-day. Give your name and address clearly,
state whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, be sure to mention this paper
and enclose 3d. in stamps to help pay postage, etc.
HERBERT HERDER, Daking House, Sydney.
HAVE YOU a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Per-
haps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored, the disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power t 6 walk. You may have attended
hospitals and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
not. Try the great British Remedy:—

“Norbell”: This is a cold, commercial
age. The Anglicans of Manilla t (N.S.W.),
regardless of the hallowed sentiment aureol-
ing the old church where father and mother
were married, and the twins were christened,
and Aunt Jane’s funeral sermon was
preached, and George Henry and Winnie
were confirmed, sold it to a picture show-
man and moved into new premises. Now
the gable ends of the once-sacred pile are
adorned with highly colored three-sheet
lithos, and irreverent small boys eat pea-
nuts and whistle “Tipperary” as they watch
the latest cowboy fight which is screened
where the altar once stood. Also, they
drink ginger beer where formerly “the kneel-
ing hamlet drained the chalice of the grapes
of God.”

“Hamer”: In swindling nothing exceeds
like success. Months ago several banks in
Sydney were rooked by a neat dodge for
considerable sums. Accounts were opened
and operated upon; and finally a cheque
was presented for eight pounds, that, of
course, being about the amount of the balance
at credit. After the cheque had been
initialled by the ledger-keeper it was altered
to appear as worth 80 pounds, and the bank
duly lost 72 sovereigns. This success
inspired another young man to effect a
trifling improvement in his cheque, making
it £215 instead of £l5; but a private mark
put on the document by a soulless ledger-
keeper gave the show away. And the ass
who couldn’t invent a kick of his own merely
got three years’ imprisonment.

“Gordon G.”: There’s this story of a
knowing old Victorian Gent. One who died
recently. He had a birthday which passed
unnoticed by friends, enemies and relatives
alike. Whilst pondering in the twilight he
remembered that he had two nephews, each
cousin to the other, and that each greatly
envied and tried to outdo the other. Where-
upon he got busy after this manner:—
My Dear Tom, —I hasten to write to thank you for
the very handsome smoker’s outfit which I have just
received from you on the occasion of my 65th birth-
day. I find, my dear boy, that it is difficult for me
to express my deep gratification at your very thought-
ful and kindly remembrance of your old uncle. I
may say, my dear nephew, that, except from you, I
have not received so much as one single letter from
anyone at all. Such is “friendship”; of such are
ones relatives! In these circumstances you may
imagine how very, very much your action was appre-
ciated. May I venture to make so bold as to hope
that on mv 66th birthday I shall be the recipient of
a whisky flask? Then, indeed, my happiness will be
complete. Sincerely thanking you once more.—l am
your affectionate uncle, William.
The same letter, was written to nephew No.
2., except that it began “My dear George”
and. that the “smoker’s outfit” and the
whisky flask”. were transplaced. Tom’s
letter was put in an envelope addressed to
Geoige, and vice versa. The old hoy drew
them both. Letters came to hand by the
first mail, one accompanied by the pipes and
too other by a flask. Each regretted the
oversight, but remarked that, anyhow, it
was better late than never, and it was hoped
that the recipient would take it in the
spirit in which it was sent, etc. That old
Gent. One chuckled for months. It was
horrible to hear him.
DIRE POSSIBILITIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I am afraid,” said Mr. Carmichael, N.S.W. Mini-
ster for Public Instruction, “that the war will affect
the Department’s building operations. We do not
realise the fearful possibilities behind this war.”
—S. M. Herald.
In the merry, merry springtim'e of our new Admini-
stration
We looked with hope and joy at tnfe financial situa-
tion ;
For the revenue was rising
In a manner most surprising,
And Ma was on good terms with her avuncular
relation.
Trades were booming, prices buoyant, and the seasons
were propitious;
Why, to hint at slump or drought was rightly
reckoned as seditious!
We had never been in power,
And it was our golden hour
With unbounded scope for spending. Oh, a feeling
most delicious!
The devotees who put us in were speedily instructed
To hold themselves in readiness for Heaven to be
inducted.
Long beers would be much longer,
And the beer itself much stronger;
The Millennium, in short, was coming—personally
conducted!
A Cabinet of geniuses the country’s fate directed ;
Unpleasant platform “planks,” of course, wer.e
dropped, or just neglected,
Or jettisoned full scornfully—
Ah, now we wonder, mournfully,
Why ever things one reckons on turn out so
unexpected.
A great and glorious time we had—a time beyond
supposing!
Four fat and gilded years sped by of feasting, fun
and dozing;
But, while we still were scattering
The cash, there came a shattering
Of all our golden dreams— we heard Ma’s Uncle’s
shutters closing!
Oh, dread was our awakening! The thing had never
dawned on us,
While revenue was rolling in and Uncle Cohen
fawned on us;
We wished, of course,' to remonstrate,
And, so, commenced to demonstrate
Our principles, but found that these had secretly
been pawned on us!
Now we confess—against our will—that all our old
facilities
For bringing in Millennia, and likewise our abilities,
Have fled, like some fair vision,
Through fatal indecision,
To recognise that, after all, Life’s packed with
possibilities 1
But though we howl “Peccavimus ’’ and plead for
exculpation, i
A horrid Fate looms over us with grim determina-
tion.
It’s not the war that worries, us,
But what’s behind that hurries us—
The possibility that we may lose our ’situation!

AGONY OF RHEUMATISM
DRIVEN AWAY AS IF BY MAGIC.
HOW TO PROVE IT.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious poison-
ous acid in the blood. This acid settles in the
joints and muscles, and causes that awful
agonising pain of backache, rheumatism,
gout, gravel, inflammation of the bladder, etc.
Weakened kidneys are at the bottom of it all.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the poison-
ous pain-causing acid right out of the sys-
tem. Every suffering reader of this paper
can prove for himself, with one or two doses,
that these pills do really touch the weak spot
• —the kidneys and bladder. When you see the
“blue” you know it’s true.
To, cure kidney trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the cause —the
poisonous uric acid. Remember, to do this,
a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder, and not through the boweis,
as _ most kidney pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy bluish color —a
feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills
from all others —you know beyond all doubt
that they have put their healing touch on
the right spot—the kidneys and the bladder.
A wonderful pill—straight to the kidneys
—that is the reason why De Witt’s give
such amazingly quick relief —every time.
A permanent cure follows in almost every
case.
DE WITT’S KIDNEY AND BLADDER PILLS
can be obtained at any of the branches of
Washington H. Soul Pattinson & Co., Ltd.,
Sydney; Longmore’s The Melbourne Phar-
macy, Bourke Street, Melbourne, and all
leading chemists at 2/9 and 5/6 per large
box. The 5/6 size is two and a half times
as large as the 2/9, and contains enough
doses to last you three weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills,
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above, and the
goods will be sent by return, post free.
Try the 2/9 size if you like —but start at
once, and you will then understand why
thousands upon thousands of sufferers, in
all parts of the world, praise De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills. But you must
be sure you get De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, in large blue and gold boxes.*

important body which looks after the welfare

Above photograph (taken on a French road) shows

farious duties that are needed to supply for the welfare
of an Army in being, and emphasises the yeoman
part played by Petrol in the present stupendous

Throughout the Commonwealth and New Zealand
Americans who saw a recent issue of the
New York Times chewed gum more furi-
ously than ever on reading a statement by
one Otto Gustav von Several Things. “Ger-
mans came to the United States,” proudly
blithered the inflated Hun, “for the same
reason that missionaries go to China —to
bestow the blessings of German civilisation.
We Germans didn’t come to be Americanised.
For American institutions and ideals we
have only contempt. We came to Ger-
manise America.” And Uncle Sam takes
off his hat and says, “Wal, I always thought
I was pretty good at that Fourth o’ July
stuff myself; but I pass you the pea-nut.”
An Australian at Oxford (Eng.) writes
his parents in Australia that if they will not
consent to his enrolment he must return
home because he can’t stand constant ques-
tioning by strange women any longer. Every
time he walks down the street he is accosted
and asked: “Are you physically unfit, or are
you a coward?” And what seems to most of
them the most interesting question is always
put first. This brand of recruiting has be-
come a sideshow for the suffragette, who
must bless the ineptitude that will not force
conscription even now —the conscription that
would utterly abolish her new job.


Very Sore, Suffered Three Weeks,
Used Cuticura Ointment, Hands
Healed in Fourteen Days,
Montague Rd., S. Brisbane, Queensland.
-“When working in my garden my hands
through being tender became blistered and
gh
then were poisoned by some
noxious weeds which I was
pulling up. They became
very sore and boils formed
and then burst and they just
looked like a child’s face does
covered with chickenpox. I
suffered for about three
weeks during which I could
only write with great difH-
culty and pain. I tried a lot of things with-
out avail until I was recommended to try
Cuticura Ointment which I did. I first
washed my hands clean and then thor-
oughly applied the Cuticura Ointment all
round the sores when going to bed at night
and washed the sores clean every morning.
I repeated daily the same process for four-
teen days and my hands healed up and got
quite well and have not troubled me since."
(Signed) George William Bunce, Feb. 26, 'l4.

TO-DAY, particular thought should be
given to one’s shoes. Definite purpose
and not caprice should rule their
choice, since Fashion recognises their diess
value and insists that they shall harmonise
with the rest of one’s attire. Thus, by
following the lead of Fashion, a very dis-
tinctive and pleasing note can be attained.
Bostocks are designed for wear with the

Died suddenly, at Melbourne, Henry
Lindgren, all-round athlete. For many years he
was a leading path-racing cyclist, and was still more
prominent as an oarsman. In the palmy days of the
Mercs, he formed one of their invincible eight.
Later, he joined the Albert Park Club, and, as
recently as 1912, was in the crew which won the
Grand Challenge Cup.
At the recent blood-stock sales in the
Cold Country the highest price was 2800 guineas
for Santa Quarale. a three-year-old filly by St.
Frusquin from Widgeon, bv Gallinule. R. Wootton’s
patron, E. Hulton, gave 1500 guineas for Black
Wings (in foal to Lemberg), a four-year-old mare
bv Santrv from Jewelled Wings. Hulton also parted
1000 guineas for liillulagh, a six-year-old Desmond
mare in foal to Polymelus. Six others ranged from
1000 guineas to 1050 guineas. A beggarly 35
guineas secured the five-year-old Lancaster, a half-
brother, by John o’ Gaunt, to Downshire, who died
in the Ma State last year. Among Lancaster’s per-
formances was the winning of the Hardwicke Stakes
( £2616) at Ascot in 1913. He was knocked down
to the British Bloodstock Agency, and may come
to Australia. Red Dennis (Tredennis-Rosey Head)
was bought by Lionel Robinson, for 500 guineas,
and will probably be sent out to the Randwick
stable of W. Kelso. The horse is a handsome four-
vear-old, and his latest good win was the Windsor
Handicap, of £535, last year. Among the year-
lings who went cheaply was a filly by Carbines
son. Spearmint, from Portrait. She fetched 160
guineas.

Walter Rutt, Germany’s champion cyclist,
well known to Australians, has been so badly knocked
about in the argument in North France that he has
been permanently invalided.

Chicago’s latest six-days’ bicycle race
stands distinguished by the fact that all dis-
tance records were broken. Up till this whirl,
2791 miles nine laps was the best on the
world’s books. It now stands at 2804 miles
eight laps. Oscar Egg, of Switzerland (who, in
1912 at Paris, unburdened himself of 50 kilornetres
—3lj miles—in lhr. 14 min. 47 2-ssee), and Fran-
cesco Verri, of Italy, were the winners. Australia
was, as usual, in these long-endurance races, well
to the front. R. McNamara, with Moran, of Bos-
ton. as partner, rode in second; and Frank Carey,
with Clarence Carum, of Jamaica, as aider and
abettor, rolled home third.

Rateliffe. who kept wickets for N. S.
Wales during its recent inter-State engagements,
is the first Australian-rules footballer born in the
Ma State to achieve success in big cricket. Burton,
who plaved the Australian-rules winter game in
Svdnev in the ’9o's, was also one of Ma’s crack
wicketkeepers, but, like Jim Kelly, who succeeded,
he was Victorian-born.
* * * *
Australian George Gray’s recent break
of 1046 (825 off the red) against Falkiner, in Eng-
land, is not an unusual item from him, but it shows
that the chance of a Zeppelin dropping a case of
dynamite into the middle pocket isn’t upsetting 1 his
nerves. His record break stands at 2196 (1944 off the
red), unfinished. This was at London in 1911. He made
his first break of over 1000 in November, 1910, at
London, and he has added a couple of dozen since.
His most prolific year was 1910-11; he made 16
breaks of over 1000 between November and March.
The highest-ever was made by W. J. Peall. That
was 3304 at London, in 1890 ; but 400 of the shots
were spot shots, the spot being then not barred.
* * * *
The Australian racing rules, which were
agreed to at the inter-State Conference last Novem-
ber, became operative throughout the Commonwealth
on Febuary 1. The four chief points are: (1)
Recognition of each other’s disqualifications: (2)
stopping the duplication of names,; (3) debarring
the carrying of more than 21b. in a flat race or
41b in a steeple or hurdle event over the weight
imposed or declared; (4) a fine up to £lOO on
any embittered or inebriated person who behaves
unrighteously to any racing official. This is ex-
pected to make the sport more like that of kings
and less like that of spielers.
ON THE DEGRADING INFLUENCE OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
British cavalry, playing water-polo in the Oise,
suddenly sighted a patrol of Uhlans. Naked, they
charged the enemy.
It was a gentle Quaker who
Was weeping by the way,
Oh, bitter, bitter were the tears
He shed that summer day.
“Oh, wherefore, wherefore dost thou weep
When all the world is gay?
Hast thou repelled thy neighbor's wife
Or is thine own astray?’’
“I do not weep for trivial things,’’
He said ; “my heart is sore
’That British troops should so demean
Themselves in brutal war.
“Thy cavalry was playing late
A foolish water game,
When sudden rose a wild alarm,
And up the Uhlans . came.
“A moment did they dare to wait,
And, while amazed they halted,
The water-sporting warriors sprang
And on their horses vaulted ;
“And heedless all of modesty,
Devoid of shirt and shelter,
They strove to ride those Uhlans down
In furious helter-skelter.
“Not one who bathed in gentle Oise
Took time to draw his breech on,
But rode away, alert and gay,
To fight without a stitch on.
“What is the use of victory
And blood that soaks and drenches,
If all our ancient decency
Is buried in the trenches?
“With every month of brutal strife
Our moral sense grows denser ;
I wonder how the news was passed
Unblotted by the censor.
“How will our Queen look down and sigh,
And likewise the princesses,
The moment that the blushing Times
The shameful tale confesses!
“Those Uhlans, too, a gallant crew,
Were forced to put a spurt on,
Because they blushed to have to face
A foe without a shirt on.
“What is the use of uniforms
If soldiers only scout them?
What is the use of pants at all
If men will fight without them?”
This was the tale of him I found
A mournful vigil keeping,
And when I left, oh bitterly
That gentle soul was weeping.

Another Wise Mother who keeps her Child Clean
and Healthy with REXONA SKIN 8 FACIAL SOAP
“I have used your Rexona Soap for myself and my little girl (four
years old) and I find it a great healer of Dandruff, as well as softening and
promoting growth of hair and keeping the most sensitive skin in healthy
and excellent condition,” writes Mrs. Jj. Blythe, 0 Marion Street, Caver-
sham, Dunedin, N.Z. “Under troublesome climate conditions, hot and
cold, it has far exceeded my greatest expectations, as I have used so many
varieties of similar articles, but I must honestly and faithfully admit
that your Rexona Soap stands unequalled above them all. I conscienti-
ously think any lady who reads these few lines of gratitude and gives
your Rexona Soap one trial will echo my praises of its virtues.”
NOTHING LIKE REXONA
for Baby’s Skin Trouble.
Try ono application of
Rexona on baby, and see the
poor little fellow jubilate
with his toes and chuckle.
If V.e could only talk he
would thank you for the re-
lief. Rexona stops itching
immediately, and for Rash,
Tetter and all skin tortures
that baby suffers Rexona is
unequalled.
For the skin troubles that
men and women suffer, for all
the itching, raw scorching
eczema, inflamed or reddened
skin, it has proved its aston-
ishing results in thousands of
cases. The immediate relief
it gives is almost marvellous.
Rexona is sold at 1/6 and

Novel Method for
Waving the Hair.
TOILET TALKS.
MANY a charming face is spoiled by
straight, lank, and excessively greasy
hair. Naturally curly hair gives a most
delightful effect even to a plain face, a fact
which has unfortunately been known for
many years. This knowledge alone has re-
sulted in the ruination of thousands of heads
of beautiful hair by slow torture from that
terrible instrument, the curling iron. Im-
agine, if you can, how the living hair squirms
and twists under such treatment. Yet this
is the very result you aim at. Well, I have
no doubt that each one individually is of the
opinion that the results justify
the meas, but let me tell you
that the reckoning will have to
be paid, and in a manner which
will be far from pleasant. The
twists and curls created by the
hot iron are the hairs’ dying con-
tortions, and it is only a question
of time when you will have no
hair left to torture. If it is
absolutely necessary to have,
wavy hair, then there is a far
more simple and harmless pro-
cess which any woman may
adopt without fear as to the
results. Get from your chemist
two ounces of silmerine, and
pour about two tablespoonfuls into a saucer.
With a clean toothbrush apply this to the
hair upon retiring. You will be quite
amazed at the result, and one application
will last for -many days. Damp weather
need have no terrors for you if you take
these simple precautions, and straight, wispy
tails will be converted into tight little curls,
giving a charming and pretty effect, even to
a plain facet
Note. —Silmerine has not been used to any
extent for this purpose, but most chemists
keep a small supply in stock.
"IV[ OW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
J3l ts expect that one particular make will
suit everybody V Certainly not.' Some
fgh
folks have dry and brittle hair, others have
tresses which are excessively greasy. Each
requires a different grade of shampoo, if one
is to obtain the best results. The writer's
notice was recently brought to a substance
called stallax, which can be obtained from
most chemists. It consists of small gran-
ules. which, when mixed with a cup of hot
water, make the most charming mixture
imaginable for shampooing the hair. Ac-
cording to the quantity used, so the strength
is graduated to suit all conditions. There
is one drawback, however, and that is stallax
can only be obtained in tins (
which cost about half-a-crown;
but as this quantity is sufficient
to make 25 to 3U (shampoos, it
is really very economical in the
end. It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some,
tastes, but this can always be
avoided by rubbing a little olive
oil on the scalp previous to its
application.
A FEW remarks on fa£e
creams may not be out of
place, and at the risk of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned, my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not
clog the pores with greasy concoctions
.which not only prevent the skin from
performing its proper functions. but
usually result in encouraging a growth
of hair on the face, and you knew
very well what that means —disfigure-
ment for the rest of your natural days
If it is necessary to use an emollient at
all, get some mercolised w r ax from your
chemist and apply in the usual way.
This remarkable substance seems to absorb
the worn and weatherbeaten outer cuticle,
and in a few days’ time the new, healthy
skin underneath peeps forth in all its
brilliance, and is, of course,, quite free from
imperfection or blemish. [3
Beyond the Rim.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE journeyed nit by Windy Hills,
and round by Shady Creek,
To seek the new and better lands
that all brave hearts should seek;
We left the homestead in our wake, and,
as we crossed the ridge,
I caught a glimpse of friendly fields beyond
the crazy bridge.
1 saw the old horse on the flat among the
blackwood trees;
I saw the red cow near the stack, with
grasses to her knees ;
1 saw the unkempt orchard trees that
straggled down the slope;
And heard the morning calls of birds like
messages of hope.
For out beyond the basin’s rim the splen-
did pastures lie —
There’s greener grass in distant lands, and
bluer vaults of sky ;
There’s richer fulness of the earth for those
that dare to roam
Beyond the humdrum ways of life that
strangle one at home.
And so we came to Stony Rise, and passed
the sleeping town.
We camped that night beneath the gums
that border on the down,
And, as I dozed beneath the stars, against
my saddle-gear,
The homestead sounds, across the night, came
drifting to my ear.
We rode across the days and nights, by
bracken slope and fen,
And many kinds of lands we saw, and many
sorts of men,
And barren tracts of sandy soil, and heavy
scraps of loam ;
But, though they won my thoughts by day,
each night I dreamt of home.
By sluggish rivers rolling wide; through
never-ending downs ;
By rutted roads that marred the earth be-
twixt the dreary towns ;
By forest tracks that lost themselves in
brakes of scrub and fern.
We sought the new and better lands, still
scorning to return.
And thus we chanced upon the plain aback
the redstone peaks—
It seemed to be the likely place for which
the brave heart seeks—
And found an old deserted hut beside a
brackish stream.
That night the cow-bells at the farm rang
clearly in my dream !
He came to us at break of day, the settler,
dried and old :
He told us of the cliffs beyond that almost
burst with gold :
Of grass knee-deep on rolling plains that
burgeoned all the year;
Of wondrous riches of the earth, and rivers
crystal-clear.
“Out there,” he said, “are better lands, where
plenty reigns supreme—
The emerald fields, the twelve-ounce stone,
and many a well-stocked stream.
And flocks and herds of every kind, and
many sorts of game,
And trees that fruit the livelong year, and
blooms that “glow like flame.
“I’d leave these poorer parts myself and
journey over yon,
But I grow weary of the march, for age is
coming on.
But ye are young and full o’ fire, and have
bold hearts, no doubt.
’Tis seemly when young spirits urge their
fortunes further out!”
Thence, as we went a-down the ridge and
crossed the arid dunes—
Which slept while hot Decembers passed,
nor woke to any Junes ;
Where nothing moved the whole day long
save vagrant birds and bees —
I heard the very ghosts of bells come tink-
ling down the breeze!
Then was it by the Outfrayed Track we
struck on that old mate
Who dwelt among the ironbarks, and moral-
ised on Fate ;
He told us of the lands beyond that teemed
with better fare ;
But that, through diffidence to ease, he
vegetated there.
“They’re rich enough, those far-off tracts —
I’ve known it from of old.
Their wealth is waiting men like you, whose
hearts are stout and bold ;
They lie well past the hills out there, all
smiling in the sun.
If I was young I’d prospect, but my days
are nearly done!”
We long had passed the purple range; we
camped in copse or shed —
By shearer’s hut, by splitter’s track, by
ruined poppet-head—
And, as I rede one summer night along the
moonlit plain.
A strange, familiar sense of things came
stealing to my brain.
The dawn was lifting in the east, the stars
were growing dim,
As we climbed up the stony rise and halted
on the rim ;
And from afar, distinct and clear, rung over
fields and streams,
I heard the self-same cattle-bells that
tinkled through my dreams !
And soon we saw the crazy bridge, and all
the homestead trees;
The unkempt orchard’s summer dress was
flaunting in the breeze ;
The old roan horse was on the flat, where
shady blackwoods grow ;
And, dark behind the three-railed fence, the
pines stood in a row.
Now. he who wills may choose the road that
lies heyond the rim—
The circle of his homestead hills. If luck
should favor him
He’ll make his journey in a ring, as mine
was made, to find
The lands for which he seeks in vain are
those he left behind !

Getting the Anchor Ready,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAVE just left my old friend Captain
Crosstree. He is a retired master
mariner, with a cynical outlook on life
in general, and a vocabulary that would
make a wharf-laborer, or even a Sydney cab-
man, take to drink through sheer envy.
Captain Crosstree had just arrived from
oversea by the R.M.S. Pumpkin, commanded
by Captain Jumperstay, R.N.R. Now Cap-
tain Jumperstay, although an extremely
capable and justly popular commander, is
well known to have many little peculiarities,
among them being a tendency to put on a
large * amount of “boiled dog,” otherwise
“frill.” Therefore, when I met Captain
Crosstree in the act of explaining to a taxi-
driver exactly what he thought of him (he
was suggesting that the taxi driver was a
lineal descendant of Barabbas, who was a
robber of note) I gathered that something
had recently happened to disturb the even
tenor of his* way. The day was a hot one,
so I suggested something with ice in it. W e
turned into an adjacent bar, and after gaz-
ing at the ceiling several times through the
bottom of a long glass, Captain Crosstree
poured out his grievance. This was the
burden of his plaint.
“It’s that Jumperstay, fool!
Let me tell you what happened. Coming up
towards the Heads this morning I was sit-
ting in his cabin talking to him. Presently
he sends a quartermaster with his compli-
ments, and will the chief-officer kindly
step along. You know his style. Compli-
ments. Huh! When 1 was at sea if I
wanted the mate I said so. And there
weren’t any compliments about it
either. Anyway, up comes Shortless the
chief-officer (you know him, good
man) and says, ‘You want me, sir?’
“ ‘Oli —er —yes,’ says Jumperstay. ‘I
wanted to see you about getting the anchor
ready. Er —Captain Crosstree and I have
been discussing this matter, and, after due
reflection, we have come to the conclusion
that perhaps it will be best to get the port
anchor ready, sir.’ ( lie. I never said
a word about it, and I was only a passenger.
anyhow, and knew well that it wasn’t
my place to speak). ‘When I say get the
anchor ready, sir, I mean just ease it out
of the pipe two or three links so as to
ensuah that it will be quite ready for letting-
go when I give the ordah, sir. You er
understand what I mean er—Mr. Short-
less. Just have the anchor all ready in case
we require it when we are approaching the
wharf. Of course, it is possible that we may
not require it at all. or, on the other hand,
we may need it. Er—and that will be all,
sir.’ , ,
“ ‘Very good, sir,’ says Shortless, and
away he goes. So help me Suffering Cats,
he had hardly got clear of the door when
Jumperstay called him back again.
“ ‘Oh —er —Mr. Shortless. Upon giving
the matter further consideration, Captain
Crosstree and I have decided —er —that is to
sav, we think, that, all things being con-
sidered, it will perhaps be as well to have
the starboard anchor ready.’ (By the Holy
Sailor, I never opened my mouth about the
anchor.) ‘You see, sir, with the wind
in this direction, and the flood tide, it will
most likely be necessary to drop the star-
board anchor when we are approaching
the wharf. Not, you will understand, with
the object of anchoring the ship, but merely
to assist her in swinging round. Of course,
sir. I do not say that we shall use the an-
chor, hut merely that we may. Therefore,
sir. will you kindly see that it is lowered
down a few links, so that there will be no
hitch should it be deemed expedient to drop
it. Er—that will be all just now, sirA
“ ‘Very good, sir,’ says Shortless, and away
he goes again. Just as he's going down the
bridge-deck ladder Jumperstay sings out to
him again.
“ ‘Oh —er —just one moment. Mr. Short-
less. Captain Crosstree and I have been giv-
ing just a little further thought to this
matter, and taking everything into considera-
tion he is quite of the same opinion as my-
self. that it would be better to have both
anchors ready. Er —you quite understand.
We may require one of them to check the
ship into the wharf. I may use one, or I
may use the other —er —I really cannot say
which. Or, again, it may not be necessary
to use either. However, you-will kindly see
that they are both ready for letting go im-
mediately I give the word. And that will be
all. sir.’ And away went Shortless, looking
as if he didn’t know whether he’d got to get siix
anchors ready, or to swab the cook’s
galley out.
“Did you ever hear anything like it?
What’s a anchor for. anyway? Doesn’t
the. mate know what a anchor is for?
Does he think it’s put into the ship for a
ornament, or to play leap-frog with?
When the skipper wants the mate to get the
anchor ready, doesn’t he call him along and
say: ‘Get the anchor ready?’ Does he
preach a sermon to him, or read him a chap-
ter out of the Book of Genesis? Does he
explain to him what the Lord put a
anchor into a ship for? Holy Cats! When
you tell the mate to get the anchor ready,
he doesn’t get it ready to lower down into
the engine-room, does he? He doesn’t polish
it up and take it aft into the saloon, and
give it to the stewardess to play with, does
he? When he gets the anchor ready he
doesn’t pull it up on the flagstaff, does
he? Ever since Noah first anchored the Ark
have you ever heard of an anchor being used
for any other purpose than anchoring a ship
with? And won’t an anchor be used for that
purpose till the Crack of Doom? Isn’t the
sole purpose of an anchor to drop into the
water? And when it drops into the water,
doesn’t it sink down through the water till
it gets into the mud! And when it
gets into the mud, isn’t it well
meant to well stick there till it’s
well pulled out again? Isn’t that what a
anchor’s meant for, eh?”
I admitted that to the best of my belief it
was.
“Then why,” he enquired wrathfully,
“why in the name of the Seven Ba-ldheaded
Geese, does that silly ■■■■»- Jumperstay
want to give the mate a oration, like
Mark Antony ordering steak and
onions in a Dago oyster.,joint?”

IF IT WERE BETTER KNOWN
that Backache, Dropsy, Rheumatism, Sediment, Dizziness and a Constant Sleepy
Feeling point to Kidney Disease, there would be fewer fatal cases than there are.
Thousands have kidney trouble and don’t
know it, because it comes on so quietly. To
all appearances the patient may be in good
health except for an occasional backache
and a heavy, drowsy feeling. But before
the disease is much farther advanced there
are sharp, shooting pains in the loins and
back; the water is cloudy and gravelly; the
patient may have to keep getting up in the
night to relieve the bladder, or there may bo
distress in seeking relief, and partial stop-
page; then the limbs begin to swell with
water (dropsy), the heart seems affected,
the hands and feet are chilly ; there may be
rheumatism ol- lumbago.
The only hope of successful treatment is
to commence before the kidneys become
seriously involved. A thorough course of
Doan s Backache Kidney Pills should be
taken to relieve inflammation and conges-
tion of the kidneys, and to restore the natural
action of the kidneys and bladder. This
medicine acts quickly and directly upon the
kidneys, promoting a free flow, by which the
poisonous impurities are flushed out of the
system.

TWO LASTING SYDNEY
CURES.
MARRICKVILLE.
Mr. W. H. Trott, 257 Victoria Road, Marrick-
ville, says : “Off and on for years I suffered a good
deal from backache and kidney trouble. Some-
times my back used to ache terribly, the pain being
particularly severe when I did any stooping. At
my work I have to stoop a lot, so it was very hard
on me, and handicapped me greatly. I took several
medicines, but none of them seemed to suit my
case. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were at last
recommended to me, and they, proved to be the
remedy I wanted, for, after taking a few doses. I
felt much better, so I continued with the Pills
until T had finished a thorough course, and I am
glad to say they drove the pain out of my back
and made me feel splendid. Two years have
elapsed since then, and I am still free of backache,
but I always keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
by me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a
little off color, and they never fail to do me good.”
CAMPERDOWN.
Mrs. G. Gavin. 57 Briggs Street, Camperdown,
Sydney, says: “For about four years I suffered a
good deal from backache and kidney trouble, and
only those who have been afflicted in this way will
have any idea what I went through. The pain in
my back was so severe that I could hardly move,
especially in the morning, when it was often
almost an impossibility for me to get out of bed
without assistance. Other symptoms of kidney
trouble were bad headaches and dizzy attacks, both
of which were very trying. I was treated by a
doctor for some time, and also tried different kidney
remedies I saw advertised, but nothing did me any
good. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were at last
brought under my notice, and they proved to be the
very thing I wanted. After taking one bottle I
felt ever so much better, and nine bottles of the
Pills cured me completely, and I have been free
from pain ever since. It is four years since I took
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so my cure has been
well tested.”

A Dream of Mixed Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
yellow day had ceased to Lurn,
| The light went out behind the trees,
It did the old world good to turn
Its shoulder to the evening breeze.
We sat upon a garden seat,
Three roses nodding overhead,
And Jane was very round and sweet
And very pleasant things she said.
Although those things were mostly sighs
I understood them very well,
Because my hot, faint soul was wise
To everything she had to tell.
The. chill wave splashed upon a rock
Six paces from our garden bower,
Yv e. heard the far post-office clock
Chime every quarter of an hour.
A ferry-boat with lashing tail
YY’ent by us moo-ing like a cow ;
Some little stars, like jewels pale,
YY’ere sitting on the night’s high brow.
All things considered, times were good,
For Jane, as I observed above,
Was in a soft and languid mood,
And all the night was rich with love.
Her kisses were so sweet to win,
And all so suited to my taste,
I gathered them like precious sin,
Holding her beauty by the waist.
Such pastimes would be hard to beat.
Our warm hearts throbbed the ancient
tune
Until right over Hoskins-street
YY r e saw the bright nose of the moon.
That instant from the rocks below,
Clear through the splashings of the tide,
I saw Amelia softly glow
All fresh and'blushing like a bride.
And from the bushes to the right
Came Sissy, with her golden hair.
A dainty damsel pink and white
And much surprised to see me there.
Kate tossed, a peach tree from her path
And, flaming through the moonlight clear,
Her dark eyes blazing jealous wrath,
Laid hold upon my hot left ear.
The whole wide night was filled with girl,
Tink girl that I had loved and kist;
About my soul it seemed to whirl
Grasping my foot and knee and wrist.
It clamored with unceasing tongue,
Upbraiding, pleading, weeping loud,
And all of it was bright and young—
I loved each unit of the crowd.
I loved it dark, I loved it fair,
I loved it round and plump and warm,
I loved it for its shining hair
And for its slim and timid arm.
I loved it when it knelt and wept,
I loved it when it stood and railed,
I loved its tender blush that crept
Up to its soft eyes velvet-veiled.
I loved it for the things it said
And for the things it did not say.
I wanted to caress‘its head
And lead its dimples out to play.
But lane was angry as a snake,
And fluttered like a moulting dove.
She said point blank that she would take
The whole or nothing of my love.
W hich caused a wrangle to ensue,
A bitter wrangle edged with scorn,
In which a pretty frock or two
YV ith wild, pink hands were rent and torn.
Thereafter, for my numerous sins,
The whole commotion round me stood,
And ordered me to gather pins
From houses in the neighborhood.
I went in haste. I did not turn.
Strange terrors urged my flying socks.
I felt my soul within me burn
Like opals in a hairpin box.
The last boat left at twelve o’clock.
I caught it with a yard to spare.
And then I knew that I could mock
At lip and eyebrow, throat and hair.
But as we passed the garden seat
Where Jane and I had kissed so well
There trailed behind us a long, sweet,
Remorseless and emphatic yell.
I saw a flutter as of mist
That into whirling female broke,
And as the moon its' tumult kist
The steamer whistled. . . .and I woke.

GEORGE STREET.
Why I Decided to Go to the
War.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I LOVE to lead a placid life. You might
not think so to look at me, perhaps.
Appearances are deceptive, and there
are times when I have been misjudged. It is
so easy to misjudge people ; so easy, that I will!
tell you a secret. lam a teetotaller. I wish
it to be remembered with as little ill-feeling
as possible that I am an inveterate teetotal-
ler. I am fond of warm milk, and drink an
immense quantity of water. Therefore, it is
not at all surprising that I should be essen-
tially a peaceable man with an extreme dis-
like for war.
The sound of a gun going off alarms me.
If I thought that it was being fired at me I
would run for my life and hide. If I couldn’t
find a hiding-place I would keep on running.
It would be hard to find a man more liable
to turn out a dead failure as a soldier, or to
be a dead soldier for failure.
If possible, one should always tell the
truth, even about oneself.
I like growing vegetables for a living.
There is nothing alarming about vegetable
culture —no element of violence. One can
handle cabbages without fear of an explo-
sion, and turn one’s back towards a radish
without running any risk of bitterly regret-
ting it. I have often seen cauliflowers fly
into terrible fits of rage because I covered
them with dirt; but they never attempt to be
revenged. In this respect they differ from
fowls, which are not only hostile but stupid,
self-willed, ungrateful and blasphemous. The
first Grand Inquisitor was a hen. These are
a few of the reasons why I do not keep
fowls. Another is that fowls talk too much.
They tire one with their complaints, their in-
sinuations concerning each other’s charac-
ter, their ceaseless repetition of inane
phrases. They seem unable to mind their
own business. I regard them as I regard
other smug utilitarians, with contumely.
They are vulgar.
And now that I have given some idea of
the kind of man I am, you will easily under-
stand what my feelings were when. I was
urged one day by Mr. Tupton, the green-
grocer, to go to the war. I immediately re-
fused. I said : “No, Mr. Tupton, I will show
my patriotism in another way. I will grow
vegetables for military purposes,” and I
carried my threat into execution that very
day by planting nineteen rows of French
beans. I greatly admire the French.
My family and relations, however, seemed
dissatisfied. They kept on urging me to go
to the war. It was no use my reminding
them that I was not the right kind of man.
They refused to see things from my point of
view. They wished me to become a hypo-
crite. When I told Thora (Thora is the
elder of my two maiden aunts —the one with
the moustache) that I was a Napoleon of
the vegetable garden, that vegetables were
my soldiers, and invited her to come out and
see them in review order, rank after rank,
not a cauliflower in deshabille, not a lollop-
ing cabbage nor a disorderly radish any-
where to be seen, she made a contemptuous
sound with the back of her larynx and said
that I was getting more and more like a
cauliflower myself every day. She meant
this to insult me. She hoped that I would
feel ashamed of myself and go to the war.
But I was not insulted. I felt no shame.
I am not that kind of man. I felt proud
instead that she should have chosen to
compare me to a cauliflower, a vegetable
worthy of the greatest possible respect (when
properly grown), and one that sets an
example, which, as I remarked at the time,
many people might with advantage follow.
A cauliflower is never insulting. It does not
argue. It is magnificently silent. I should
be the last to grumble if I woke some
morning to the discovery that during the
night I had changed into a cauliflower. It
was unwise of me, to say this out loud,
because my aunt overheard me.
“And a good job too if you did turn into
a cauliflower.” she remarked, curling her
lips up over her moustache, “and somebody
bought you for fourpence and boiled you for
half a day. It would do you good !”
To tell you the truth, I had not thought
of that and had no reply ready, but in order
to seem heroic, I said : “Nor would I mind
if I were boiled for half a day.”
From this out my life rapidly became
unbearable. “Why don’t you go to the war?
Why don’t you go to the war?” morning,
noon and night my intimates and fools of
relations would ask me. Sometimes they
w°ul d say it ns if struck with a sudden and
most biilliant idea, at others in a tone of
melancholy, a wheedling tone, asking and
persuading, as it were, at the same time;
more often, however, they would ask it in a
way which suggested that they were tired
ot me. But I knew it! I knew it long ago.
Ihey are tired of me! I am tired of them.
Ones feelings should always be reciprocal.
“Why don’t you go to the war?” The
parrot added it to his already extensive and
uninteresting repertoire. This is the final
nail in that particular bird’s coffin. This
time I have a stratagem which will succeed.
Ii begins with a feeling of giddiness and
ends m of epilepsy. One dose is
usually sufficient.
“Why don’t you go to the war?” I would
wake with a start in the night and swear
that shapes slunk away from the bed into
corners of the room with their question
unanswered. By-and-bye they would come
back all creep back, and bend themselves
into query marks, some standing on one leg
and some on another, waiting for an answer
They annoyed me. Everything began to
annoy me.
One night when I was busy adding up
my debts by candle light, the figure “12”
stood slowly up on the edge of mv notebook,
and asked me in a voice about the size of a
pin’s head why I didn’t go to the war. I
ran for my life and hid in the vegetable
garden. I felt that something must be
wrong.
For some time I lay quite still, bathed in
perspiration, afraid to move. Greedy snails
gnawed the cabbage leaves and grunted in
whispers. That was the only sound to be
heard, so by degrees my courage returned
and my pulse resumed its 791 beats per
minute.
I decided to venture from cover, and was
creeping on hands and knees cautiously past
my shadow, when all at once a turnip rose
slowly to its full height and coughed. In a
threatening voice it then demanded to know
why I didn’t go to the war.
Rushing down a steep declivity towards
the edge of a precipice the brakes refuse to
act. You know the sensation.
One after another all the different
vegetables in the garden rose slowly from a
crouching position, and standing on tip-root
they flapped their leaves and demanded to
know, mostly in a kind of shrill falsetto, why
I did not go to the war.
This was the last straw. The position
had to be faced. I was hemmed in on all
sides. My retreat was cut off. I decided to
capitulate. Rising unsteadily to my knees.
I lifted up a voice which shook like a cat in
an ice-chest. I faced my questioners, and
ungluing my tongue from the roof of my
mouth. I managed at last to speak.
“Friends and fellow vegetables.” I said,
“in response to numerous requests, I have
at last decided to go to the war.”
All the vegetables then sat down, with
the immediate result that I stopped
perspiring. I also seemed to hear a loud
hooray, which appeared to proceed from
somewhere inside me.
The following day I tried to enlist and
was rejected.

What a Father
Says:
“I like Pemlflgton-UMC Armi
and Ammunition because I want
my children to enjoy the benefits of knowledge
in the use of fire arms. Not only will this
afford them much sport and recreation, but,
should occasion demand, to defend their home
or their honour. Accidents in handling fire arms
come through ignorance of them and I want my
children to know how to use them. And for all
of the above reasons I want them to have arms
that are modern, that have a solid breech and
ammunition that I know is reliable and accurate.”
