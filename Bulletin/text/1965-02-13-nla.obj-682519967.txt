A SET
OF CINTURATOS*
IS AS GOOD
AS AN ENGINE
TUNE
Town or Country ...
Cinturato tyres stay with It
longer than conventional tyres.
They run cooler, generate less
heat at high speeds and
disperse heat more easily. Less
heat, less wasted engine power
mean economies in fuel con-
sumption.
Cinturato drivers marry safety-
first with safety-fast because
Cinturatos absorb less power,
turn the car into a manageable
motor. These tyres don’t play
fast and loose; you can take
the bend ahead with the con-
fidence of a train driver glued
to the rails. The grip is superb
because the tread is always
open to engage the road, wet
or dry.
High performance, maximum
efficiency, he travels fastest,
safest and surest who travels
by Cinturato. If you're still
waiting to try this fabulous
tyre . . . hasten the d.ay!

The latest International trucks to be introduced to
Australia,
INTERNATIONAL TRUCKS
Forerunner of a long line of “Robins”, the “Red Robin” inaugurated Broken Hill’s bus
services in August, 1922, when it was brought overland from Sydney by Mr. W. E.
Duffy. It was an International truck chassis fitted with a bus body, and had solid rubber
tyres and carbide lamps. The trip of 710 miles over mere tracks was completed in 61
hours ... a feat of endurance for both driver and vehicle.
In 1924, 1929, 1936 and 1938 further buses, all called "Robins”, w'ere added to the fleet . ..
and, in each case, the vehicle was an International chassis fitted with the latest bus body
style. The service was operated successfully under the most trying outback conditions for
twenty years before it was transferred to Whyalla. Over the years, the many smaller pri-
vately-owned bus services have amalgamated into two main companies; however; Interna-
tionals still operate in the streets of the “Silver City”! Engineered and built to withstand
the most rugged conditions the world over. International trucks are quality all the way
.. . the enduring quality that has made International “the most trusted name in trucks”!

The warm wool in the mittens II
of this non-yanishing Eskimo
came from Australia via C. Itoh
Woolen mittens may be a small item, but they
show the scope of C. Itoh activities. One of
Japan’s oldest and largest trading companies,
C. Itoh buys the wool in Australia, imports it
into Japan and exports the finished products
(all wool or blended with synthetic fibres) to
the world. And this is only one of over 20,000
items, handled by C. Itoh & Co. experts in
import, export, joint investment ventures and
triangular trade.
Whether you’re selling igloos to Eskimos or
selling or buying anything almost anywhere in
the world, it might be a good idea to get in touch,
with an experienced C. Itoh trader at any one
of C. Itoh’s 70 overseas branches or affiliates.
He’s probably solved your trading problem
before you’ve quite found out what it is, yourself.

Six good reasons why you
should own a Rover
1. Rover is a very lively machine. Driv-
ing in city traffic is deceptively smooth
and docile. But Rover has great re-
serves of power. Top speed is more
than 100 mph. The three-litre motor
develops 129 horsepower-you cruise
at 80 all day. Overdrive is standard
equipment. You may choose between
a fully automatic transmission or a
more sporting four-speed synchromesh
handshift.
2. Rover is exceedingly comfortable.
The lack of fatigue over long distances
is quite remarkable. You relax in fully
adjustable seats deeply upholstered in
hides of the finest English leather. The
spaciousness, thick pile carpeting and
luxury appointments add to your com-
fort and pleasure. Door arm-rests also
adjust to suit your fancy. Noise and
vibration rarely intrude, even at high
speeds.
3. Rover’s attention to finish is a mat-
ter of record. The paintwork, for in-
stance, is sprayed with five hand-
rubbed coats of special enamel. Hand-
polished African cherry is inlaid on
fascia and window trims. The simple
classic lines change very little from
year to year. (An international gold
medal has been awarded for coach-
work.)
4. Rover is also a very safe car. Big
servo-assisted disc and shoe brakes
need only a touch to dissolve even the
highest speeds. Safety padding, wind-
screen washers and tamper-proof locks
all add to your feeling of well-being.
Vision is excellent. A superbly engin-
eered suspension gives you the kind
of smooth road-holding and handling
you’d expect from the men who de-
signed and produced the gas-turbine
cars.
5. An air of quiet luxury is to be found
throughout the entire car. Heating and
demisting equipment is built-in. You’ll
also find a courtesy light above each
door. Two-level ventilation for each
person. There’s even a hidden nest of
tools. A reserve fuel supply. And a
switch to tell you the oil level in the
motor. Sound absorbing underlays,
rubber body mounts, and thick under-
body sealing keep out dust and ex-
traneous noise.
6. Parts and service are not expensive.
A network of specially chosen dealers
will do everything to keep you happy
with your Rover-long after you’ve
bought it. Rover has earned a reputa-
tion for being one of the best engin-
eered motor cars in the world. It is
designed to be driven and enjoyed
long after many ordinary cars have
been discarded. Your investment will
in fact cost less to maintain than most
others, regardless of price.
There are many more exciting aspects
to this fine car. If you would like
the pleasant experience of discovering
them for yourself, please write or tele-
phone. We’ll send a Rover to your door.

National Notebook
Layabouts
r | a he programme notes set everyone
(including one or two Sydney music
critics) right about where and when the
Proms began. “The idea of a ‘promen-
ade’ concert at which audience could
stand or stroll about in a cleared area
originated in Paris.” However, some-
where between Paris and the first Lon-
don Proms in 1838 and the first Sydney
Proms last week, audience had ceased
to stroll about. Some of the Sydney
promenaders openly preferred to lie
about.
As if to emphasise that this was really
just an ordinary series of concerts at
which you could sit on the floor instead
of seats, the doors were closed, as usual,
to prevent late arrivals walking in dur-
ing items.
ABC organisers who said they were
pleased with the public reaction to the
Proms were not quite so gratified by
the effect on the Town Hall acoustics
of the removal of all those seats. Critics
complained of “fuzziness”. Audience
experienced “unusual vibrations”. No
complaints, for once, were received from
members of the mostly young audience
who sat behind the numerous auditorium
pillars. At these Proms they were
sought-after positions, providing both
floor-level participation and something to
lean your back against.
Getting the Knack
T> ehearsing “1 he Knack” in the
Liverpool Street YWCA building at
midnight has its problems. “But wait
till we start on Act III!” said New York
director Eli Ask. Act 111 of “The
Knack” seems to consist mainly of yells
ot "Rape! 1 hey done me! Rape!” from
the girl in the play, Nancy.
Mr Ask’s midnight rehearsals are as
unconventional as were his auditions at
the Phillip Theatre. Actresses shed
their shoes and actors donned crash
helmets and dark glasses as they tried
out for the four parts in the play.
“Auditioning is a barbaric practice that
has turned into a ritual." Mr Ask told
us. "1 like to break down the ritual
and get actors to do things spontane-
ously.”
Ann Jellicoe’s comedy opens at the
Phillip on February 19 after a week of
public previews at reduced prices.
“We’re test-marketing it.” said Mr Ask.
“I’m surprised it’s not common practice
here. A play should be seen in its best
light at the official opening.”
Mr Ask was assistant director when
the New York production of “The
Knack” opened the new Establishment
Theatre Company. It is still running
there and will go on a national tour
when Mr Ask returns in about five
weeks’ time.
Will Sydney be seeing a rehash of the
American version? Mr Ask replied:
“I don’t suppose I should say this, be-
cause audiences here seem to want car-
bon copies, but carbon copies are im-
possible. It’s foolish for people to want
or expect one. There have to be changes
to adjust to the different actors and
different stage, of course.”
Mr Ask spoke enthusiastically of
“Talent 64”, which he directed on
Broadway last year. “This is a kind
of showcase where actors do scenes for
one night. All the agents and producers
go. The whole idea is to get the artists
jobs. There were 70 of them and almost
all got jobs from it. It's one of the
nice things that happen in theatre.”
“The World of Cleaver Bunton”, a
profile of Albury, NSW, by J. C.
Horsfall, is on page 53.
He also spoke of working on an
experimental film called “Chappaqua”,
which we may see in the Sydney Film
Festival. Jean-Louis Barrault was one
of the small cast. The very experienced
Hollywood cameraman was constantly
vexed trying to anticipate the unpre-
meditated movements and actions of the
actors. “It’s a Western where the In-
dian wins,” Mr Ask explained.
Mr Ask was once an actor. He opened
a scrap-book at a picture of himself in
a toga and with both eyes gouged.
“John Ringling-North. the circus man,
had a beautiful Italian Renaissance
Theatre transported piece by piece to his
estate in Florida,’' he said. “We opened
it with ‘Oedipus Rex’. But he ended
up having to show Wednesday night
movies.”
“Will they show movies in your
Opera House?” he asked.
The Lady in NZ
VTew Zealand begins 1965 with the
-*■ censorship position as muddy again
as ever it was —with a third authority on
book censorship emerging. For years
the clerks of the Customs Department
had it all to themselves. Then came the
Indecent Publications Tribunal to which
the Customs Department could refer
books, or to which publishers and private
individuals could appeal.
Now the New Zealand Cabinet, no
less, has got into the act. Late last
year Cabinet members took time off
from New Zealand's economic situation
and settled down to a good read. Their
choice was D. H. Lawrence’s “Lady
Chatterley's Lover’’ in hardback edition.
Cabinet approved of the lady, but left
a decision on the paperback edition to
the Indecent Publications Tribunal.
The reason for Cabinet intervention
is not clear. It could hardly have been
to relieve pressure on the tribunal, whose
decisions on authors such as Baldwin,
Nabokov and Burroughs have been re-
ceived quietly. One suggestion is that
Cabinet felt certain, in the light of
recent decisions, that there was no pos-
sibility of the tribunal judging the hard-
back edition indecent; it therefore took
upon itself the responsibility of judging
the book. However welcome the deci-
sion, it must surely undercut the author-
ity of the supposedly independent tribu-
nal. If the Cabinet itself is always to
give a verdict in tight spots, one wonders
what the point of the tribunal is at all.
It is a bad precedent.
Wines that Travel Well
'\js7hen the Matson Line resumed the
* * Australian run in 1957 with the
Mariposa and Monterey, the wine lists
of both ships included Australian wines.
However, since Mr Bill Meeske came to
Australia in 1961 as regional vice-
president of the company the selection
of Australian wines has grown more
representative.
Now Mr Meeske has gone even fur-
ther. He has got Australian wines on
board a ship which doesn’t even come

aura of South Seas openness is especially appealing. These liners completely air-conditioned and gyro-
stabilised are especially'designed for this tropic route. • each with private facilities are
unusually spacious. Tastefully furnished and decorated, they provide charming, gracious living. Cuisine is
lavish, epicurean. Meals are interspersed with snacks and buffets. Room service is available at any hour.
The liners’ wine cellars are tended as carefully as any on shore. As unique as Matson’s ships are the
enchanting ports of call; Noumea, Suva, Niuafo’ou (Tin Can Island), Pago Pago, Honolulu (almost two full
days here: a paradise for fun-lover, sight-seer or ardent shopper) and San Francisco. Return departure can
be made from either San Francisco or Los Angeles, then via Bora Bora, Tahiti and Rarotonga to Auckland
and Sydney. A Matson voyage, featuring American service, cuisine and exquisite comforts, is designed and
priced to please demanding travellers accustomed to the finest. Isn’t it time for you to enjoy this

Further Afield
A group of 20 Australians left Sydney
airport recently for a 63-day Round
South America trip. The 12 women and
eight men, mostly in their 50s, represent-
ed the first unsponsored group ot Aus-
tralians ever to tour that\part of the
world on such a scale. The tour was
organised by Neville Salisbury, who has
made it his business to show plane-loads
of tourists the Australian North, the
North-West and Centre as well as Portu-
guese Timor, Papua and New Guinea.
Mr Salisbury's business is based on
chartering planes. In 1958 as a part-
ner in the Walgett, NSW, stock-and-
station agency he conceived the idea of
taking graziers who wanted to see more
of their country by light aircraft to
wherever they wanted to go. He soon
found himself chartering DC3s. Three
flights in 1961 became five flights in
1962, eight in 1963 and ten in 1964.
In September, 1964, for the first time
Timor was included in the original
Kimberley trip.
This included a vast jig-saw puzzle
of charters, the getting of the best ac-
commodation. the organising of the most
interesting ground excursions, and the
finding of agents and interpreters.
Health and other regulations in the
multitude of South American countries
had to be complied with but eventually
the job was done.
The first batch was soon together
and recently 20 elated people with
a Spanish dictionary-toting Neville Salis-
bury jetted off into the evening sky.
New Approach
“Tjj'ROM the Tropics to the Snow” must
in the early stages have been a good
idea. It’s hard to make a. 30-minute
travel film showing the full range of
Australia's tourist attractions, so why not
make a film showing just how hard the
job is? Somehow News and Information
was talked into this, and instead of hiring
the usual mob of sheep and two tame
kangaroos, they hired Alexander Arch-
dale to play the producer with safe, ste-
reotyped views on travel films, Alister
Smart, the director with the Rothman’s
cigarette advertisement approach and
Reg Livermore the scriptwriter hanging
five from the New Wave.
A script, which was intermittently
funny and occasionally extremely point-
ed, was prepared. Then the whole idea
fell to pieces, simply because it was es-
sential that the photography should point
up with some wit the differences between
the conventional, the commercial and the
“artistic” approach. However, visually
there wasn't a pin to put between the
three sections of the film. The photo-
graphy all had the brightly colored, un-
subtle quality of Uncle Ted's holiday
snaps from Burleigh Heads.
Ageless Hero
CJays mine host, 54-year-old Perc
Hardy, licensee of Australia’s old-
est hotel, the Hero of Waterloo in
Sydney: “She’ll be standing for another
century.” The 160-year-old pub, on the
corner of Windmill and Lower Fort
Streets, Millers Point, was once bar-
racks for the Queen’s Own 50th Regi-
ment. Then the walls resounded to the
clamor of soldiers and the lash of the
cat-o'-nine-tails, and press gangs preyed
on the unwary who were thrown in the
barrack’s dungeons and later dumped
on ships to serve His Majesty.
“I’ll take you down and show you,”
Mr Hardy said. We walked down Wind-
mill Street a few paces to a large,
locked door. Mr Hardy opened it and
switched the light on. A musty smell
mingled with that of freshly brewed
hops. The dungeons now house the
hotel's beer cooling system while the
University of NSW Architecture Stu-
dents’ Club has taken over the convicts’
cookhouse as an art studio. Abstract
paintings, paints, brushes, canvases and
a piano in one corner make strange
contrast to the thick stone walls and
heavy steel bars.
“Mercifully,” Mr Hardy said, “the
Hero is just outside the Rocks redevelop-
ment area.”
Has the hotel ever been declared as
an historical inn, we asked Mr Hardy.
“No, but we have approached the Mari-
time Services Board (because it owns
the land) for this but they weren’t
interested. Three months ago we con-
tacted the National Trust but so far no
word.”
The pub has not always been called
the Hero of Waterloo. When the bar-
racks became a hotel it adopted the
demure title of The Little Princess. But
in 1815 the title was changed to the
present one to commemorate the Duke
of Wellington’s victory at the Battle of
Waterloo.
“See in here,” said Mr Hardy, point-
ing to a small room in a darkened cor-
ner, “those two wrist chains hanging
from the wall. You can just imagine
the poor beggars being chained in here
for days.” Mr Hardy moved over to
the wall. “Just here was a tunnel lead-
ing to Walsh Bay. The*-press gangs
used to drag their victims through there
and on to ships. According to historians
the authorities finally stopped this caper
by sealing the tunnel.”
THE GREAT NEW GUINEA RALLY
feuLLetisi
80 Years Ago: February 14, 1885
IT'HOSE who did not attend the New
Guinea annexation at the Sydney
Town Hall missed a treat. It was real
fun from start to finish. The prime
movers of the meeting were all either
missionaries, Orangemen or catspaws
of the Orange Lodges. The opposition
comprised supporters of the Stuart
Ministry, who were afraid Parkes was
about to be galvanised into public life
by the annexation movement; Secu-
larists, holding the views of the Eng-
lish radicals against extention of the
Empire; Irishmen and Irish-Austra-
lians, embittered against Hallelujah
Henry Parkes: Germans and Scandi-
navians (many of them wharf-labor-
ers), and philosophical supporters of
the right of Germany to occupy the
islands of the Pacific. The irrepressible
Tommy Walker, of trance-medium
fame, was there, and tabled a conun-
drum in the shape of an amendment
which no sane person has yet been
able to solve. Then came the irrepres-
sible David Buchanan, with his ever-
green proposition for the establish-
ment of an Australian Republic. This
was strangled In the most ruthless
manner by the chairman. Of course
the redoubtable E. W. O'Sullivan
bounded on to the platform and be-
gan an energetic oration in defence of
Gladstone and the Germans. The cli-
max arrived when he and Walker in-
vited the crowd to a meeting outside,
which was held, and where the Mayor
was denounced in language which was
forcible, if not polite.
The meeting should teach a lesson
to certain people. There are a lot of
purblind journalistic mannikins who
think that they know or can lead
public opinion by leaders in the Syd-
ney daily papers. There being no re-
sponse to their little puffings and blow-
ings, and they being laughed at for
their petty arrogance, this meeting of
monster excitement was got up to
show how the people were on their
side against German annexation of
New Guinea. And the meeting has
shown that the people never were, as
they never will be, on the side of these
fellows. But the lesson will be thrown
away. However, it was just as well that
it should be given.

PLAIN ENGLISH
“Beware the Ides of March”
T ast week Mr Tom Dougherty point-
ed out that, whenever a well-known
Communist is attacked in the Federal
Parliament, some ALP members
“break their ankles getting up there
to defend him”, but no Labor member
ever gets up to defend the Australian
Workers’ Union when it is attacked,
despite the fact that the AWU is one
of the ALP’s main sources of money
and equipment. It is no wonder that
Mr Dougherty has at last had enough
of the ALP’s Left wing and that the
AWU has withdrawn its support from
the Federal Parliamentary ALP.
This will have far more immediate
effects than some commentators admit
who point out that the ALP does not
now need AWU money since there
will be no Federal election for over two
years. For Mr A. Calwell, the leader
of the ALP, the portent reads: “Beware
the Ides of March”. On March 17,
Federal Caucus meets in Canberra for
the first time since a Senate election
which was even more disastrous for
the ALP than the 1963 election defeat,
and the most bitter public attack on the
ALP by the AWU since the 1930 s
will overshadow all other business. It
may result in a “spill” for the leader-
ship, with Mr Gough Whitlam strength-
ened by the AWU’s official and public
rejection of Mr Calwell.
The question now is: Will Mr Whit-
lam act? Will he launch the much talk-
ed-about purge of the ALP? The
doubts result from his past dilatoriness,
his combination of big talk and little
action. About a year ago Mr Whitlam
prepared his report on the ALP’s
electoral disaster of 1963 and it
seemed for a moment then that the
long - awaited move to purge the
pro - Communists might begin. Mr
Whitlam pointed out, what everyone
else had been saying for years, that
the party was controlled by a Leftist
extra-Parliamentary machine that re-
duced the Parliamentary party to either
impotence or to' parroting Left-wing
slogans, and that the Communists con-
trolled many of, the unions that com-
posed the party and therefore could
manipulate it. He made it clear that
without a purge the party could never
win an election. Yet when it came to
a showdown, Mr Whitlam retreated
and the tendencies that he attacked
grew in strength.
Just how dependent on the Leftists
the party’s leader, Mr Arthur Calwell,
has become in the past year is clear
from the series of pitifully self-deluding
signs of “leadership” he has shown
since the Whitlam report. Early in
1964 he led a large-scale parliamentary
assault on the Government designed to
throw suspicion on the ANZUS alli-
ance and the readiness of the United
States to defend Australia in the event
of attack. The move was largely in-
spired by Dr J. F. Cairns. Then came
his intervention in the Victorian State
Conference as a candidate for the
party executive, his support of Mr L.
Haylen in the pre-selection for the
third NSW Senate seat, and his recent
support of Liberal Senator Hannan
against the DLP’s Mr McManus. He
has never lifted a finger to reduce the
Communist influence on the ALP.
But, despite this confirmation of the
Whitlam line, is there any reason to
believe that Whitlam will be more prac-
tically aggressive today than he was
a year ago? Clearly if he is to be-
come party leader, then he must take
the initiative now or he will be handi-
capping himself for the 1966 elections.
He will certainly need the maximum
time to push through the party purge
that he rather lamely advocates. For
unlike Mr Harold Wilson, who had
the foundations of reform within the
party laid for him by the late Mr Hugh
Gaitskell’s modernisation programme
and his courageous onslaught on the
Left wing, Mr Whitlam will be starting
from crumbling bedrock.
Mr Whitlam can in theory do one of
three things. He can move immediately
for the leadership, forcing a Caucus
election to get rid of Mr Calwell; he
can wait for a year or two and hope
that the prospect of another election
failure in 1966 will cause enough Labor
parliamentarians to insist on his taking
over; or he can wait until Mr Calwell
becomes a foui-time loser and take
over as leader of a thoroughly demora-
lised party in 1967 never having
himself been in a government and not
looking like being in one for years to
come.
But of these choices only the first is
a practical one since delay can only
strengthen the Left wing and their
candidate, Dr J. F. Cairns. Mr Calwell
clearly will not voluntarily resign from
the leadership (he no doubt believes
the sad joke thought up by his Leftist
backers recently that he is “on the
threshold of greater things”) and the
only other way that he could be re-
moved would be for the reactionary
Left, on which he is totally dependent,
to withdraw the props holding him up.
The recent “testimonial” from the
Victorian Leftist unions, however,
shows how unlikely this is. They know
that the longer he remains as leader,
the stronger the Left wing becomes
and Dr J. F. Cairns, who already
dominates the Victorian ALP and is
greeted by cries of “Leader, Leader” at
party conferences.
The AWU has given Mr Whitlam
his opportunity. The trouble is that in
view of his failure to follow through
his attack a year ago and the
present predominance of the Left wing
in the Labor Party, he may well find
another excuse for delay. The ironical
result of all his brave words and delay-
ing tactics may well be that he finally
becomes a leader of the same sort as
Mr Calwell a prisoner of the Left
and a mere incident in Dr Cairns’ rise
to leadership.


THIS AUSTRALIA
SENATE
No Withering on the Vine
“I can’t lose ”
MELBOURNE —So confident were
DLP officials that Mr Frank McManus
would be elected to the Senate that they
went ahead with plans for a victory
celebration even before the final figures
were released. He is to be their guest
of honor at the big ball they are planning
in March to mark the 10th anniversary
of the Hobart Conference in 1955 —
when the Labor split became unmend-
able.
Mr McManus 'was just as confident.
At the end of the recount of primary
votes he said: “I do not see how I can
now lose the fifth Senate seat.” Support
came from Liberal Senator Hannan:
“Unfortunately from my point of view
the recount did not change the figures in
the manner hoped for.” At the time of
going to press, more than 60 days after
the election, with a High Court hearing
on the recount behind him and the dis-
tribution of preferences still to come, it
looked as though Frank McManus would
return to the Senate seat lost in the 1961
elections.
Holding a BA and Dip. Ed. from Mel-
bourne University, McManus is the in-
tellectual leader of the DLP and their
most able television personality. Before
going into politics professionally he was
a teacher for 20 years at State high and
technical schools. Perhaps more than
any other DLP leader in Victoria he
understands the ALP. He joined it in
1925 and became vice-president of the
State branch in 1948.
He was elected to the full-time job of
assistant secretary and was one of the
key organisers of the breakaway group,
later to become the DLP, which he rep-
resented in the Senate from 1956-62.
Out of the Senate he became the Federal
organising secretary and paid special at-
tention to the Party’s propaganda and
advertising, especially on television.
His own recent television campaign in
Victoria showed a switch in strategy
away from the regular attacks on the
ALP for their tacit support of unity
tickets which previously formed the
main theme of DLP programmes. In-
stead, the theme was “Vote Mac Back”.
When he appeared himself he stressed
the need for defence, attacking the
Government, mentioning the ALP and
Communist influence only occasionally
and seemingly coincidentally.
Although his election will mean that
technically the Government will lose its
majority in the Senate, the presence of
McManus in Canberra as well as Queens-
land’s Vince Gair will mean more for
the future of the Labor Party than for
the Government.
The recognition that the DLP will be
in Parliament, at least until 1970, and is
probably here to stay may mean that
some Labor politicians will make use of
McManus’ return to Canberra to open
negotiations on an alliance, or at least
an exchange of preferences. There is
clearly no point in the ALP expecting
the DLP to “wither on the vine”.
Iyi'EANWHILE there are red faces in the
Commonwealth Electoral Depart-
ment over the discovery of 6991
additional informal votes in the Vic-
torian Senate recount. This disturbing
total of errors could be considerably
increased if the number of votes pre-
viously classified informal, but de-
clared formal in the recount, were
added. It represents a lot of informals
to find in what is, in fact, the third
count.
The Electoral Office has always
claimed that it then conducts a second
meticulously careful count before dis-
tributing preferences and that the second
count weeds out practically every in-
formal. The Victorian recount proves
this claim to be untrue.
One reason is obviously the employ-
ment for the count of casual labor, some
of it engaged from unemployed regis-
tered with the Labor and National Ser-
vice authorities. The tedious task of
checking thousands of ballot papers was
obviously too much for some of these
temporary employees. Correct judg-
ments on formality or informality were
beyond many of them. In justice to
them, the job is one for trained and
highly competent personnel.
FRANK McMANUS
Not all the blame lies with electoral
authorities. The political parties have
dodged their responsibility to supply
scrutineers at the count, who would have
provided the additional check necessary
to ensure formality. In Victoria each
party has for years run away from the
job of supplying the 125 scrutineers for
two or three weeks, necessary to cover
the 33 voting centres. The recount
forced them to undertake the task, but
even then the DLP alone fully manned
the tables. The Liberals manned most
tables, the ALP about half. The new
informals discovered proved the need
for scrutineers to ensure a correct Sen-
ate count.
Undoubtedly, a probe of the Com-
monwealth electoral machinery must be
undertaken. The Victorian recount has
offered disquieting evidence of serious
error and, if Senator Cole obtains his
recount, Tasmania could supply more.
An obvious and essential reform would
be to repeal the provision for filling in
a number in every square. Some top
ALP men advocate that the voter be
required to vpte for only one more than
the number to be elected. There would
be a sigh of relief from electoral officers
is this were done. It would certainly
save days and would more than halve
informals.
ALP
Security Risks?
Revenge of the Peace Congress
SYDNEY —Mr John Forrester of
the New South Wales ALP Executive and
a secretary of the Flight Stewards’ Union
has been suspended for three months
after being accused by the Left-wing
Victorian ALP Executive of having told
students at the Melbourne University
that there were security risks in the
ALP. Forrester was never formally
charged with any breach of ALP ethics;
there was only an investigation into the
assertion by the Victorian Executive.
Forrester claims that he did not use
the alleged phrase and that his words
were reported inaccurately and out of
context —by someone sent there de-
liberately to distort what he said.
If the three months’ suspension was
due to an “indiscretion” by Forrester,
as stated, what will happen about Mr A.
A. Calwell’s reference to the “angel of
death” for example, Mr G. Whitlam's
alleged statement in New Zealand, and
Dr J. Cairns’ telegram of support to the
striking miners at Mt Isa?


Mr W. Colbourne possibly thought
Forrester’s suspension would placate the
Federal and Victorian Executives with-
out incurring the hostility of his allies.
However, the Victorian Executive and
some members of the Federal Executive
were savage that Forrester's punishment
was not greater. At the same time many
ALP members in NSW feel that he was
not penalised for the Victoria incident,
but his active opposition to the recent
Peace Congress in Sydney. (Forrester
appealed to the State Executive to re-
verse its decision to support the Con-
gress and was defeated. He then actively
campaigned against the Congress.)
The suspension is likely to give the
ALP officers an excuse to exclude For-
rester from the officers’ list of candidates
for the State Executive at the ALP Con-
ference in June.
WEST AUSTRALIA
The Benn Case
10,000 signatures for petition?
PERTH Disappointed but un-
daunted by the West Australian Govern-
ment's firm rejection last week of a
petition signed by 800 seeking Dr
Maurice Benn's early release from gaol,
the organisers are already planning
another—with a target of 10,000 signa-
tures. The organisers are heartened by
history. In the last WA mercy killing
in the 1930 s a pardon was granted after
three petitions had been presented and
this was not followed by a wave of
similar killings as the anti-release group
predicts would happen in the Benn case.
With the State on the brink of an elec-
tion the controversy has fortunately
shown no signs of becoming a political
issue.
Benn, the former head of the WA
University’s German Department, is
serving a 10-year term for the murder
of his mentally retarded son. He was
originally sentenced to death but this
was commuted after a nation-wide up-
roar. The State Parole Board has set
seven and a half years as the minimum
term he must serve before being eligible
for release, and as Premier D. Brand
said last week, he would not interfere
with this. It is most unlikely that the
Board will again review Benn's term.
Meanwhile, the former university
lecturer is engaged in clerical work in
the prison store and because the Fre-
mantle Gaol offers him more scope for
his studies he will not be moved to a
prison farm. The prison authorities
say he can be more readily supplied
with books and papers he wants at the
gaol. Benn has from 5 p.m. until
“lights-out” at 8 p.m. to himself and
his cell is equipped with a table, chair
and bookshelf.
ART
Kerfuffle of the Year
" Schoolboyish, not obscene ”
PERTH Brisbane artist Jon Mol-
vig caught Perth unawares when his
work of art, “A Short Order Portrait
of Our Little World No. 2” caused the
art kerfuffle of the year. Molvig emerges
victorious if his intention was to shock
Perth, although some Perthites maintain
he went about it in a tasteless way.
The painting - described by London
art critic John Russell as schoolboyish
depicts a backside with a daisy, an
eye, a bird, a snake and fish making
up its symbolism. It is similar to a
picture hanging in Sydney's Komon
Art Gallery except . that it carries a
number of cartoon-style bubbles with
typewritten phrases ridiculing Western
Australia's art tastes. One says: “In the
past, although my symbols have been
extremely simple, they have (particularly
in Western Australia) been misinter-
preted. So 1 feel it only right to indicate
to you the viewer some idea (no matter
how elementary) of my intention.”
The painting was shown because, as
gallery o\vner Mrs Rose Skinner
explained, “he was invited to compete
and his painting had to be hung”. Molvig
exploited that immunity. With him on
JON MOLVIG
the victory dais—no doubt unwillingly—
stand Tom Wardle (the cheap grocer),
sponsor of the £5OO art prize, and Mrs
Skinner. Mrs Skinner said the correct
things while the file of viewers length-
ened from 20 on the first day to 600
on the second. But within 24 hours two
senior detective-sergeants arrived and
the painting came down —presumably
because it was considered obscene.
The London art critic John Russell,
who called it schoolboyish, denied it
was obscene, and a few, like the festi-
val’s intense, bearded young executive
director, lan Channell, wailed that the
hysteria would make Perth “a laughing
stock”. The general view is that Molvig
had no right to be so crude but those
who might otherwise have provided
wiser counsel allowed the situation to
snowball into farce. The question is: has
Perth’s answer to Molvig’s childish ges-
ture revealed a childishness that was
Molvig’s original target?
LAW
Stalemate
Six to one
SYDNEY Following the High
Court’s decision last week on the NSW
airlines case —which left the stalemate
still unresolved —the acting Prime Min-
ister, Mr J. McEwen, announced that
the reallocation of air services in NSW
would be discussed between the Federal
and State Governments soon.
By a majority of six to one (the Chief
Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick dissenting)
the Court decided that the State’s licen-
sing legislation was not inconsistent with
Commonwealth law. The State Govern-
ment introduced this legislation to en-
able it to give the Sydney-Dubbo ser-
vice, formerly conducted by Airlines of
NSW, to East-West Airlines Ltd. It
licensed East-West Airlines for the ser-
vice and refused Airlines of NSW a
licence for the route. The Common-
wealth reacted by amending its Air
Navigation regulations to make a Com-
monwealth licence necessary for such
services. It then licensed Airlines of
NSW to conduct the Sydney-Dubbo ser-
vice and refused a similar licence to
East-West Airlines.
The Full Bench last week found most
of the Commonwealth licensing regu-
lations valid but not inconsistent with
the State law. This means that the
allocations of NSW air services was a
matter for agreement between the two
Governments.
Premier of NSW, Mr J. Renshaw,
admitted that the Commonwealth could
still prevent East-West Airlines flying
between Sydney and Dubbo, but as far
as his Government was concerned the
airline could go to Dubbo. He felt that
any difficulties could be resolved if the
Commonwealth recognised that there
were some aspects of intrastate airline
operations which were the sole province
of the States.
Meanwhile Airlines of NSW, a sub-
sidiary of Ansett Transport Industries
Ltd, will continue to operate a Dubbo-
Canberra service which links with Syd-
ney services and East-West Airlines hop-
ed for an immediate Commonwealth
licence to fly a direct Sydney-Dubbo
route.

NEW ZEALAND
No Common
Market
Fleet of 1.6 ships
AUCKLAND - One of the saddest
jokes of the new year was the reported
statement by the newly-appointed British
Trade Commissioner in Brisbane, Mr
Arthur Vine, who has just completed a
three-year term in Christchurch. Accord-
ing to Mr Vine, New Zealanders are
talking about the possibility of a com-
mon market between New Zealand and
Australia. ‘There is a lot of discussion
on it,” he said.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. Even the modest concept of a
limited free-trade area seems to be dying.
Tentative talks and reports on the subject
have apparently reached a dead end,
and there is no sign of rescue coming
from the top.
True, Australian agriculture can’t
compete with New Zealand’s, no more
than New Zealand industry can com-
pete with Australias. Yet in the last
trade year New Zealand bought nearly
£67 million (NZ) of Australian goods,
and ended with an adverse balance of
£5l million; and New Zealand finds it
difficult to negotiate easier entry for even
vegetables and forest products.
Even in defence where—with Malay-
sian problems so pressing—there might
be urgent thoughts, there has been little
but fitful and lukewarm talk about
greater co-operation. Indonesia’s de-
nunciation of New Zealand at—United
Nations —shortly before it withdrew
from that body—left this country vir-
tually unmoved: though predictable, it
had at least the virtue of clearing the
air; up to now Indonesia and New Zea-
land have exchanged only polite words
over Malaysia.
For an allegedly aggressor nation,
New Zealand is spectacularly under-
equipped. The Navy has an effective
fleet of 1.6 ships; the rest are literally
falling apart. Most of the aircraft in
use by the Air Force are more than
twelve years old. The country will not
have a full-strength Territorial Force
until 1968, and in the event of a war
involving New Zealand the Army would
need at least nine months to place a
fully trained brigade anywhere. The
New Zealand rate of spending on de-
fence —around £l4 a head —is one of
the lowest in the Western world.
But in one of the most remarkable
statements of 1964, Prime Minister
Holyoake told New Zealanders that the
country was obviously spending enough
on defence. “Otherwise,” he said, “we
should be spending more . .

Crime Conference
Rehabilitation without Rationality
HOBART The day after Sir Win-
ston Churchill died in London Mr Justice
McClemens of the NSW Supreme Court
launched the Third Triennial National
Conference of the Australian Prison
After-Care Council in Hobart (January
25th to 29th) with an apt quotation.
Speaking in the House of Commons in
1910 Churchill had said: “The mood and
temper of the public with regard to the
treatment of crime and criminals is one
of the most unfailing tests of the civili-
sation of any country.”
In the light of this criterion what
degree ot civilisation has been attained
in Australia today? Here as elsewhere
the general public displays variously
sentimentality, vindictiveness, and mor-
bid curiosity. But last week APAC
conference delegates including not only
judges, magistrates, prison administra-
tors, probation and parole officers and
academics, but also voluntary workers
from all States evinced a very different
set of altitudes, in session, not many
miles from Van Diemen’s Land’s in-
famous Richmond Gaol, where prison-
ers were once confined to dark cells
until they became blind or insane, they
spoke calmly, objectively and dispas-
sionately.
The objects of APAC are defined in
its consitution as being to assist and
promote after-care work for prisoners.
One might anticipate moral uplift and
philanthropic platitudes repeated until
the mind numbed. But in Hobart, as at
previous conferences (Adelaide 1959,
Sydney 1962), it was clear that, like
the American Correctional Association,
APAC is not just a congregation of
benevolent do-gooders, but a body
deeply interested in all matters relating
to the prevention of crime and the
treatment of offenders.
Thus one of the most interesting
papers was Dr W. S. Matsdorfs “Work
with Migrants in Prison After-Care”.
Matsdorf, who is a NSW parole officer,
dealt with the whole problem of
migrant crime. (Rightly, because
if American experience is any guide we
shall need to devise special preventive
and rehabilitative measures to deal with
groups of migrants who may be spe-
cially vulnerable.) But he had been
hampered from the start by his inability
to obtain facts and figures about the size
of the problem. His own impression,
and that of others in the field, was that
it had grown and was growing. But a
request to the Commonwealth Depart-
ment of Immigration for recent informa-
tion had been met with a copy of the
1957 “Report of the Committee estab-
lished to investigate the conduct of
migrants” which was based on statistics
relating to 1955.
Yet, since 1955 over one million new
settlers have been added to the Austra-
lian population, and many others have
passed from infancy to adolescence. It
will be interesting to see how much
longer the Department of Immigration
is able to get away with reassuring eva-
sions implying that the present position
is substantially the same as in 1955.
If it is, why not publish the figures?
Another contribution of major signi-
ficance was the proposal by Sir John
Barry of the Victorian Supreme Court
that an Australian Institute of Criminal
and Penal Science should be founded
and maintained by the Commonwealth.
His proposal was supported by guest
speaker V. N. Pillai [Director of the
United Nations Asia and Far East In-

One of the most revolutionary pro-
posals, that parole boards should be
independent quasi-judicial administrative
bodies with control over their own funds
and power to implement decisions, was
rejected. A minority recommendation
to the effect that decisions to release
prisoners before the completion of their
sentences and that control over such
persons should remain matters for the
Executive Government was adopted.
But there was general agreement that the
vast majority of long-term prisoners
should be released to conditional liberty
and that parole supervision should be
flexible.
In addition, a variety of resolutions,
dealing with matters ranging from the
employment of discharged prisoners in
Government undertakings to the difficul-
ties in which the families of prison in-
mates find themselves over hire-pur-
chase commitments, were discussed.
APAC has long argued that the fact
that released prisoners do not qualify
for unemployment benefit until three
weeks after discharge means that during
the immediate post-release period most
ex-prisoners are subjected to unneces-
sary stress. All the evidence suggests
that this is the most perversely false eco-
nomy. For this crucial period has been
shown many times and in many coun-
tries to be precisely when the risk of
reversion to crime is at its greatest and
when many of those destined to become
persistent offenders again fall foul of
the law. Sir John Barry’s complaint that
rationality and consistency are conspicu-
ously lacking in our approach to the
rehabilitation of offenders could not be
more strikingly illustrated.

AUSTRALIAN POST OFFICE
by Lord H. W. Bowden for a strong
re-orientation towards teaching and
research of science and technology as
befitting Mr Harold Wilson’s new Min-
ister of State for Science and Educa-
tion had the supporters of the humani-
ties struggling, they were still able to
raise their voices at the end.
Drawing on a wide international
experience and work as principal of the
Manchester College of Science and
Technology, Lord Bowden explained
fully why he was in the civant garde
of the Wilson Governnient’s silent
revolution in higher education. His main
message to the school was that Austra-
lia should follow suit,
A .
Australia should re-examine the func-
tlons of the universities and ask: “What
do we expect them to do for society?
It is not just a question of bigness,
though some of us believe that if we do
not have bigger universities, we shall
not be able to afford anything else. It
is largely a matter of adapting the
universities, along the line of American
and Russian experience, to serve the
needs of society, which means primarily
industrial society,” he said.
Australian universities were bogged
down by teaching undergraduates. This
was of course a vital function, but
universities themselves must have a deep
understanding of the unique obligations
they owe to the State. Thus the basic
question, he said, was how were Aus-
tralian universities to ensure that what
they teach was real, exciting, changing
and contemporary? His answer was that
the university world must be associated
as closely as possible with the worlds of
industry, of commerce and of manu-
facture.
The path then was clear, but com-
plicated. It might mean, as in the United
States, throwing the universities inextric-
ably into the arms of the Federal Gov-
ernment. “You may say,” Lord Bow-
den said, “that the Government has
taken over the American universities.
And at the same time the universities
have taken over the central Govern-
ment. This has happened in the last
decade and the whole nature and struc-
ture of government has been trans-
formed. Dons are everywhere in Wash-
ington.”
Australian dons had not yet begun an
assault on Government, the Public Ser-
vice Board was myopic toward the in-
dustrial and business expert, even the
representative business or industrial
delegation was regarded with suspicion
and only tolerated for public relations
purposes.
“The initiative has to come from the
Government, but the paucity of research
dons in Australian universities precludes
much being done. We are starved of
PhDs, the position here being worse,”
said Lord Bowden, “than in Britain,
where some of the blame rests on the
success of the UK Department of Scien-
tific Research and the great research
stations operated by Government depart-
ments. So in our case much of your
trouble may be due in turn to the
success of the CSIRO, which has fos-
tered pure research so successfully that
it almost dominates it. The CSIRO was
a quick and efficient way which might
yet prevent the full flowering of Aus-
tralian science. It is not too late to face
an alternative solution, so earnestly and
so slowly and so triumphantly adopted
by America and Russia,” he said.
He did not say it precisely, but warned
that Australia should not make a sacred
cow out of the CSIRO because pure
research in isolation to the universities
shut out graduate education. “It mustn’t
be forgotten that research programmes
produce men as well as techniques.”

Have Australian Films Any Future?
While the world industry shrinks. ..
By CHARLES HIGHAM
As this article goes to press, 20th
Century-Fox has started prepara-
tions for filming D’Arcy Niland’s
“Call Me When the Cross Turns Over”
with Diane Cilento and Sean . Connery,
on location at Broken Hill in May.
The studio has also acquired the rights
of Alan Seymour's “The Delinquents”,
from a novel by Criena Rohan, origi-
nally to have been made by Jack Lee
and Joseph Janni for a British company.
We might, perhaps, be" forgiven a gri-
mace of scepticism over both these
projects: during the past few years, we
have been visited by a round dozen film
makers, all equipped with scripts and
promises of stars; Michael Powell
(“They’re a Weird Mob”), Jack Lee,
Karel Reisz (“Ned Kelly”), Ted Willis
(“The Skedule”)—these are only a few,
and the King Brothers, Joshua Logan
(“Careful He Might Hear You”) and
Albert Zugsmith (a fishing story to be
set oft the coast of South Australia)
have all announced schemes without
setting foot on Australian soil. In a
way. this series of abandoned projects
is dishearteningly typical of the way
things have gone fot the industry here
over the past 30-odd years; the occa-
sional “Sundowners”, “Overlanders” or
“On the Beach” haven’t really done more
than give a temporary inoculation to a
business that seems, for one reason or
another, to be permanently on the edge
of extinction.
The nostalgic still point to the fact
that Australia made the first feature
film, “The Early Christian Martyrs”, on
a Melbourne tennis court in 1899, a
pre-DeMillean spectacle which, like its
successor the following year, “Soldiers
of the Cross”, was directed by a forgot-
ten genius of the Salvation Army, J. H.
Perry. Later, as the silent cinema began
to call for stories of outdoor adventure,
Australia launched into a series of films
about bushrangers or cattlemen;
“Thunderbolt” (1907), “Robbery Under
Arms” (1907), “The Wreck of Dunbar”
(1911), “Frank Gardiner, King of the
Road” (1912) —these are typicql titles
of the period.
By 1915, Australia was producing 21
films in a year; later, films like “The
Sentimental Bloke”, “On Our Selection”,
“The Kid Stakes” and Frank Hurley’s
famous documentaries were to become
the historical landmarks by which the
archivists abroad could measure the
country’s achievement in the period.
And at the very end of the era three
McDonagh sisters of Drummoyne made
a number of remarkable films; the Mc-
Donaghs, star, art director and director,
were offered a Hollywood contract.
With the sound period. things
changed sharply for the worse. The
cost of sound equipment, late, anyway,
in reaching an Australia that was still
a step behind in the 20th century, made
film making prohibitive and put, among
others, the McDonaghs, who had re-
fused Hollywood's offer in order to
battle on here, out of business. The
famous Hayseed comedies, made by
Beaumont Smith, and some of the “Dad
and Dave” series did well, but soon
Cinesound—the main producer of films
here, with its own releasing set-up—
found that film-making costs rose from
£12,000 to at least £20,000. Cheap by
world standards, perhaps, but still ex-
pensive by local ones, since the local
market could not recoup the costs of
making these films, and they stood little
or no chance overseas against competi-
tion from Hollywood.
Charles Chauvel (“Heritage”, “Un-
civilised”, “Jedda”) struggled gamely on
through the 19305. His films, none too
well directed, were still probably the
best of an Australian period in which
Hollywood was in its heyday, and the
brilliant Warner crime melodramas and
musicals, the M-G-M historical romances,
overpoweringly dominated the Austra-
lian market as they did in every other
English-speaking country. By the
19405, only two productions (on aver-
age) a year were being made; of these,
only the Englishman Harry Watt’s “The
Overlanders” —with a superb cattle
stampede still remembered from almost
20 years ago—really made an interna-
tional impression. In 1951 Fox made
the disastrous “Kangaroo”, in 1954
Hollywood's Byron Haskin made “Long
John Silver”, in 1956 Anthony Kimmins
made “Smiley”, in 1957 Jack Lee made
the excellent “Robbery Under Arms”,
and in 1959 Stanley Kramer's “On the
Beach” and the Hecht-Hill-Lancaster
fiasco “Summer of the 17th Doll" were
produced. All these were overseas pro-
jects; none was directed by Australians.
In the whole perod, only John Hcyer’s
beautiful “Back of Beyond” and Cecil
Holmes’ uneven but intermittently pro-
mising “Three in One” —based on three


short stories, including one by Henry
Lawson —seemed to suggest a real Aus-
tralian talent trying hard to get off the
ground.
Australians want Hollywood
jC'ROM the beginning, the American
film has been what Australians most
wanted to see; British films have often
had a rocky passage here. Fox started
up here as early as 1916; Paramount
had been releasing products for three
years before that. M-G-M started up
in the early 19205, dynamically led by
Bernard Freeman, who is still after 40
years head of the company here, an
astonishing endurance record in the ever-
fluctuating history of film companies
operated overseas by Hollywood. After
working in New York, Freeman was
sent by Arthur Loew of the parent com-
pany to get things going; starting
from an office in Sydney’s Manchester
Unity Building, he built up a thriving
business with pictures like “White Sis-
ter”, with Lillian Gish. He also
pioneered talkies here; he still remem-
bers the showing of “Madame X” at
the Theatre Royal, with sound records
of the dialogue being played on a
wooden floor rattled by the passers-by
while the players silently mouthed from
the screen. At one moment, during a
very tense sequence a needle stuck in the
groove and the dialogue was repeated
over and over again; it brought the house
down. (Later, M-G-M attracted notice
when Arthur Loew came to Australia and
made the first flight from Adelaide to
Alice Springs to deliver the morning
paper.) Freeman rebelled against the
Hoyts-Greater Union monopoly of the
distribution set-up in Australia in the
1930 s and pioneered independence by
taking a lease of the Cremorne Theatre
in Brisbane and gradually extending
M-G-M’s theatre activities into all
States.
Freeman’s office, with the Metro lion
prowling across his desk in bronze,
carried the old, confident Hollywood
stamp (and could give a point or two
to several offices I saw at the Cali-
fornian headquarters). Over at Para-
mount, Bob Graham, polished Ameri-
can comptroller of the local set-up,
occupies still larger and more sumptu-
ous quarters, with discreetly shaded
lamps and solid panelling; I saw no-
thing in Hollywood to match this de-
gree of elegance. Like Freeman, he is
conscious of the excellence of the Aus-
tralian market for American pictures;
even in a time of struggle for the in-
dustry, this has, he says, been one of its
best outlets abroad. And Paramount
has come up with brilliant publicity
campaigns to please the public it knows
it can rely on; most notably the occa-
sion when Glen Ascham, Sydney, was
taken over for a party in honor of
Alfred Hitchcock, hearses arrived at the
door, hostesses were dressed up like
witches, Death Adder Cocktails were
served, and the reception room was
dressed up like a funeral parlor, with
candles guttering Gothically, while the
Master lurked in a corner. Columbia
did well, too, holding a preview of “The
Old Dark House” in a coffin-laden Old
Dark House, tying up a nation-wide
vacuum-cleaner campaign for “Our
Man in Havana”, sending a local Gid-
get to Rome in a contest for “Gidget
Goes to Rome”, and, for “The Mouse
That Roared”, set in a kingdom depend-
ing on wine growing, staging previews
in wine cellars . . .
Australian showmen have frequently
won American awards for their displays
and campaigns and Bill Beecham’s “Film
Weekly”, the lively local trade maga-
zine, is full, issue after issue, with de-
tails of clever promotion stunts, pic-
tures of well - staged premieres, a
persistent glow of confidence in Holly-
wood and its products. No question,
then, despite the success of foreign
films released here by Sidney Blake,
Robert Kapferer and Nathan Schein-
wald in recent years, which country still
overwhelmingly dominates the Austra-
lian film scene.
All this makes the local screenwriters
and directors, foundering in a morass
of documentaries, sponsored films, and
commercials, bitter and jaded. There
has been a steady flow of talent to Eng-
land, where, rather forlornly, writers
and directors hope to break into an
international big time which in that
country is proving, even for the veteran,
sadly elusive.
A few writers, notably Peter Yeld-
ham, have succeeded in making a large
income in London. But the subjects
they are working on, in the dreary
wastes of BBC Television and quota
quickies, scarcely suggest a possible
artistic outlet.
Those left behind feel very strongly
that American and British interests, bent
on exploiting their own product through
their own theatre chains—Hoyts and
Greater Union —deliberately pushed out
the local product in the ’thirties. The
industry’s answer is that it did distribute
what was there. But quite obviously,
industry representatives point out, the
crudely made, simple-hearted, low-
budget Australian films of the early days
of sound didn’t stand a chance against
the huge spectacular DeMilles, the
Hollywood musicals and thrillers. Herb
Hayward, now assistant to Norman B.
Rydge of Greater Union and an indus-
try pioneer who was involved with
Cinesound in its producing heyday, told
me: “The facts are that as costs rose it
no longer became feasible to make pic-
tures purely for the local market. And
as Hollywood films grew in size and
proficiency the local production was un-
able to compete. BEF and other com-
panies did occasionally distribute Aus-
tralian films—at a loss. Today, of
course, the situation for Australian films
is quite hopeless. The public wants to
see big budget, American colored films
with leading stars. To compete, Aus-
tralian films would have to match up
to the best Hollywood standards of
production and presentation . . .” Other
industry men have pointed out that even
the best British “new wave” films sel-
dom did well here (or in America);
they were too grim, too cheap-looking;
the increasingly hedonist public, bent
on excitement and escape, wanted color
and stars and bright story, not gloom
and rain and sad broodings over Man-
chester backyards.
Obviously, Australia cannot hope to
produce films of the colorful kind that
is saving Hollywood today, which would
be at least on a two to four million dollar
budget. There are no directors or
producers in the country with an over-
seas name (except the British Jack Lee,
who seems to be retired temporarily
from features), no stars, and no inter-
nationally-known cameramen, art direc-
tors or editors. Then what about low
budget or medium budget black-and-
white pictures? Donald Wynne, a Bri-
tish director of B-pictures, has been
trying to set up production of low-
budget films here for release in England,
but he has been having a struggle: “The
problem is that there is no one in the
country whose name means anything
on a British marquee .• . . the local
banks and businessmen refuse to take
a gamble on local production, so I have
to set up finance through my British
contacts . . . but to get finance I'll have
to bring in a British ‘name’,” he says.
Government sponsorship
Lee Robinson, who made “Walk Into
Paradise”, and, recently, “The Dawn
Fraser Story”, does not feel that star
names are necessary to sell a picture
abroad; he believes that “a formula
story set against an unusual background,
the Red Centre, the Barrier Reef, cattle
and sheep properties . . would recoup
its costs. But this seems, on the evi-
dence, a rather forlorn hope; his “Walk

into Paradise” of a few years back did
do well (in easier times) in America but
most of the money went into the pockets
of its promoter, the now celebrated Joe
Levine. (Robinson’s long-time partner,
Chips Rafferty, the only Australian actor
who still lives here and is known over-
seas, says that if he fails to raise finance
for a new project from private investors
he will give up all attempt to get features
going in this country.)
Many film-makers believe that only
Government support can bring about
the renaissance of feature film-making
here. They recognise that, without
stars or glamor, Australian films are
not going to stand a chance internation-
ally, and (hat they must be subsidised.
(Presumably the local distributors would
have to be subsidised against loss as
well, and the international distributors,
of course, may refuse to distribute them
at all.) With any luck, in an assisted
low-budget industry, individual talents
may emerge and flourish. They point
to countries like Denmark, where the
overseas companies; are forced to plough
back profits into local production; to
Britain, where a National Film Finance
Corporation lends money to indepen-
dents; and to Italy and France, where the
State again makes loans to producers
(and, in Unifrance and Unitalia, has
organisations which maintain a satisfac-
tory image of the country’s film product
abroad). None of these countries’ govern-
ments interferes with policy, or compels
a film-maker to present a flattering image
of his own nation. The staggering prestige
gained by Italy and France since the
emergence of their new film directors —
Antonioni, Fellini, Visconti, Truffaut,
Godard, Demy, to name only a few—
has repaid a thousandfold the enlight-
ened government policies in these mat-
ters. But as a sobering footnote to this it
should be pointed out that both countries’
film industries have lately been in a state
of crisis; as “Sight and Sound” recently
pointed out, the public even in Paris
queues up for “The Longest Day”, not
“Jules et Jim.”
Implementing the Vincent Report
Rafferty and Lee Robinson have
made applications to the Government
for various systems of financing indi-
vidual producers. They were, once,
actually offered a loan from the Reserve
Bank but were unable to take it up
because they did not own 50 per cent
of their own company, which was in
the hands of individual shareholders
(50 per cent ownership was a require-
ment of the agreement). Since then,
they have not been able to strike a
satisfactory deal with the Government.
Recently, producers have tended to
apply not for assistance for features, but
for help in making television films,
which they believe would give them the
experience to develop talent at the fea-
ture level. In 1963 a Senate Select
Committee under the late Senator Vin-
cent recommended that there should be
Government loans of up to 50 per cent
of approved production budgets of Aus-
tralian film producers; that there should
be taxation concessions to encourage
investment in Australian filming; that
there should be other concessions to
attract overseas directors, technicians,
writers and stars; and that one million
pounds should be advanced from con-
solidated revenue to help the industry
get on its feet.
John Kingsford-Smith of Kingscroft
Productions, who, among others, gave
evidence before the Committee, has put
forward the most thoroughly worked out
individual plan for film production here
to date. He wants 5 per cent levied on
all imported TV films, which he esti-
mates would raise £400,000 per annum
after two years. Ten per cent of the
money would be put aside to train
writers and directors. £25,000 would
be put aside for a salary to a topline
American salesman to sell the product.
A permanent Australian director of the
fund would be paid £5OOO a year. £5OOO
a year would be set aside for office
rent, administration, secretary and travel
expenses. £5OOO would go to experi-
menters and the rest would go into
assistance to the existing industry.
An interesting scheme, but the main
imponderable still remains: how to sell
the material overseas? Mr Kingsford-
Smith suggests engaging an American
salesman to sell the product on the US
market, but the point is that, no matter
how professional and polished Austra-
lian films may become, they are still (on
the basis of his own scheme) only going
to be in that category known as the
medium or low-budget feature bracket
(say, £lOO,OOO - £400.000) —a bracket
increasingly shrinking internationally as
the appeal of this kind of film dwindles.
The fate of many of the British features
in this category in America should give
Mr Kingsford-Smith pause. Assuming
that in 10 years (as he suggests) we are
making films as good as those being
made in England today by, say, Karel
Reisz, Lindsay Anderson, Seth Holt, or
Sidney Furie, we would have little or
no chance of making profits with them
in America, the only English-speaking
market which counts. Outside the art
houses in that country, all save a tiny
handful of British medium-budget films
die the death. No matter how good
that £25,000 a year salesman might be,
he would be selling, commercially
speaking, a dud product. In a nutshell,
then, local film-makers are aiming at
the production of the very films which
have least chance of overseas (i.e.,
American) success.
No Australian film artists?
Mo doubt, with the kind of training
" Mr Kingsford-Smith advocates, local
directors, writers and technicians could
be enabled to produce films for local
TV. Richard Lane, a local writer who,
like so many of his colleagues has been
hit by the decline in locally produced
radio drama, believes that the TV sta-
tions should be compelled to allow a
quota of viewing time to local produc-
tions, even if these cost more than
overseas dramas to buy. But one can-
not help feeling that a plethora of TV
series or dramas, or of low-budget TV
films, is scarcely going to assist Austra-
lian prestige as an emergent culture
abroad; or get sufficiently good ratings
to justify the TV companies’ expendi-
ture here.
Only two kinds of film today find an
international audience; the blockbuster
and the “art” picture. It is clear that,
with our resources (and even with
Government help) the former type of
film is out of question. International
stars —without which no such film can
succeed—command gigantic sums, and
so do the directors who can handle
them, who can create the glossy cello-
phane packages in which they must be
exhibited to the public. Only overseas
countries can hope to set up such pic-
tures in Australia; no local company or
individual has the international con-
tacts to make such a film possible. The
art film, too, seems to be out here;
there may be Antonionis or Fellinis
struggling along making Bm.m. films in
back streets, but on the evidence of
those amateur films I have seen, they
have not yet shown their work in pub-
lic. There is a lack of creative pressure,
of artistic drive, which constantly dis-
turbs; it is worth remembering that the
young French film makers of the New
Wave began as fiercely partisan critics,
making pictures with their own. their
wives’ or parents’ or friends' money,
sacrificing everything to get their per-
sonal vision on film ... so, too, a good
many of the young people in England
who are now successful: Walter Las-
sally, who photographed “Tom Jones”,
is an heroic case in point; and one
has not forgotten the bitter struggle
Lindsay Anderson had to get his ideas

on to the screen. Sylvia Lawson and
others have vociferously, and quite
rightly, called for an Australian film
culture to emerge; but who, one won-
ders, are they pointing to as the frus-
trated artists, the local Antonionis or
Fellinis or even Jonas Mekases who but
for Government indifference would now
be startling the world?
The fact is, I suspect, that although
there is a good deal of technical ability
in the country, directors, cameramen,
good actors and writers, there is no
artist—and no really dynamic group of
young film people who want to set the
world on fire with their personal vision.
A magazine like the Melbourne “Film
Journal”, admirable, widely read inter-
nationally, would surely be the platform
for such people if they existed; a kind
of Australian Cahiers du Cinema . . .
There is a small nucleus of film enthu-
siasts in Australia, but they are either
running festivals, working in Govern-
ment offices, or in medicine or law.
Only Dick Brennan and Douglas White in
Sydney and Tim Burstall in Melbourne
seem to be making the effort to create
personal films; and one should not forget
the documentaries of Dahl and Geoffrey
Collins, which have been shown suc-
cessfully at the Venice Film Festival.
But despite their qualities, none of these
directors suggests a potential giant of
Antonioni or Fellini calibre.
No experiment
Xj’hLM making on the experimental,
wholly non-commercial level in which
Australia could yet make a mark, calls
for a dynamic imagination, in idiosyn-
cratic, difficult, artistic intelligence to
make its impact felt. In France, Italy,
America and Britain such men have
emerged; working at night or on week-
ends, spending their life’s savings, they
have —like a man writing a poem or a
novel —been prepared to sacrifice com-
fort for the pleasure of artistic release.
Perhaps in the comfortable society we
have made for ourselves, it is harder and
harder for people to leave their jobs and
go hungry to make films. It’s all too
easy to give up the uneven fight, to dash
off to the ABC, the BBC or the Theatre
Arts course at UCLA. But one
feels that only men of dedication staying
at home, working without Government or
television support, showing their films at
festivals abroad (where, today, talent
tends to be instantly recognised) will be
able to convince the reluctant that there
really are frustrated film artists in Austra-
lia, not simply technicians waiting for a
chance to make low-budget films which
will go into a rapidly decreasing
picture market in America.
ON THE MARGIN
On Having Half a Ball
largest English-speaking city in
the Southern Hemisphere.” This
boast is made about Sydney in a travel
folder. It sounds impressive enough till
you remember that most of the big Eng-
lish-speaking cities are in the Northern
Hemisphere.
It is the same when someone brags
of having the biggest hat factory or the
most valuable stamp collection in the
Southern Hemisphere. The other hat
factories and stamp collections south of
the equator do not offer first-class com-
petition. The biggest ones are probably
in Brazil but who knows or cares
what they have in Brazil?
Mind you, I don't want to run down
the Southern Hemisphere. I was born
there, and have resided there for most
of my life. A man has a natural sense
of loyalty to his home hemisphere. I
believe ours is as big as any
other hemisphere the world
has to offer. It is an old-
established one, and has an
assured future. Yet, fond as
we are of the old hemisphere,
we should not blind ourselves
to its shortcomings.
Chief of these is that so
much of it is water. The
Pacific Ocean, especially, is
bigger than we could wish.
When the land masses were handed out,
the Northern Hemisphere got more than
its fair share. That is one reason for
its attitude of superiority.
Our hemisphere has another handicap
the late start it made in the progress
business. The native inhabitants, such as
the Australian Aborigines and the Bantus,
were decent but conservative folk. The
hemisphere did not go ahead until visi-
tors from the North moved in. This has
encouraged Northerners to treat the
Southern Hemisphere as a country
branch office. They gave it contemptuous
names like “the Antipodes” and “the
flip side of the world”.
I would like to do some plain speak-
ing about the Northern Hemisphere. It
has admirable features, but it is too stuck-
up. Granted, it contains the biggest hat
factories, the most valuable stamp col-
lections, etc. These advantages are large-
ly the result of the Northern Hemi-
sphere's luck in getting in first.
Among other things, it had the ad-
vantage of drawing the first maps. It put
the Northern Hemisphere on top, and
ours at the bottom. That is why we have
to put up with being referred to patronis-
ingly as “down under”.
There is no reason, apart from custom,
why the Southern Hemisphere should
not be on top and London and New York
“down under”. An organisation should
perhaps be founded to manufacture maps
and globes of this upside-down kind. It
would remind Northerners that they have
no geographic right to consider them-
selves top people. The organisation could
be called Friends of the Southern Hemi-
sphere.
You notice one sign of their self-con-
fidence north of the Equator they
don’t restrict their boasting. Nobody
declares a hat factory (or atomic pile,
or Christmas pudding) to be the biggest
in the Northern Hemisphere. They call
it the biggest in the world. It is taken for
granted that the hillbillies of the South-
ern Hemisphere have nothing
like it to offer.
How feeble, by contrast, is
the Australian habit of claim-
ing that something is the big-
gest in the Southern Hemi-
sphere. It suffers from the
weakness of qualified super-
latives. It is like saying that
So-and-so is the greatest
mathematician in Woy Woy;
or that Mrs C. is the best
dressed woman in Broome.
I suggest that we give up hemis-
pherical boasting. We impress nobody by
going the half hog. We only remind
them that many things are bigger in
the Northern Hemisphere.
The Southern Hemisphere is still a
good place for the average family. I have
been to the Northern Hemisphere, so I
know what I’m talking about. It is
all right for a holiday, but you wouldn’t
want to live there.
Not that I hold with hemisphere pre-
judice. It is out of place in the demo-
cratic world of today. A man should be
judged on his merits, not asked what
hemisphere he comes from. After all, we
all belong to the same sphere.
I would go further and say that any
boasting about things being the biggest
or best, should be avoided. As a
journalist I have found that if you say
Mrs C. is the best dressed woman in
Broome, some nuisance is sure to write
to the editor: “Mrs D. is well-known to
be the best-dressed woman in Broome.”
It is safer, as well as more modest,
not to say your hat factory is the big-
gest in the Southern Hemisphere. Just
say you have a big hat factory (assum-
ing that you do have one).

Gracie in the Guitar Age
“A raggle-taggle lot of rag-bags"
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Most recent star visitors to Sydney
have come on very strong: Judy
Garland with her face-matching
white dress and war-w'ound smile, Ethel
Merman with her sequin eyes and sugar-
cube-sized garnets, Shirley Bassey with
her grey-chocolate skin, claw'ing fingers
and relentless chain-smoking after
breakfast. All these formidably got on
with the show': the bright or frenetic
image lingers. Yet Gracie Fields could
be almost anybody: raw, tough, brazenly
Rochdale on stage, 1 found her a grey
and subdued figure off it, her memory
hesitant, her conversation halting and
oddly introspective.
Expecting the apotheosis of Factory
Favorites, all coarse temper, bottom-
slapping jokes and warm, “lovable”
back-streets humor, one met the real
woman almost with a sense of shock.
In the lobby of her hotel—perhaps the
worst place, barring a railway station
platform, one could think of to inter-
view anybody she was slowly en-
croached on by bystanders: just behind
me a predatory-looking female edged
closer and closer, hanging on every
word, while facing us members of the
hotel staff. Gracie Fields' sister, the next
interview'er. a public relations man,
arriving and departing guests and
tradesmen coming in and out, all stared
more or less obviously in our direction.
Through this dumb-show Gracie Fields
remained impervious and modest about
the long career which had taken her
from the Rochdale slums to playing be-
fore crowned heads, Hollywood, and
world tours singing at cheering thou-
sands.
“1 still can’t believe I'm Gracie
Fields,” she said in a faint voice, and
one didn't doubt her. “I never did learn
music and I'm still not too good' at the
spelling or grammar.” She had, she
said, begun by singing—at the age of
seven —to a star on the stage of a thea-
tre; she had been “planted” in the gal-
lery, as a child who so admired the
actress she had learned her songs off
pat. “She would sing ‘what’ and I
would come back with ‘wot’ . . . finally
she’d put a big breath behind the ‘h‘ and
I'd learn to do it properly . . . after that
I joined a juvenile troupe on tour. My
mother took in laundry from the thea-
tres . . . We went all over England, ter-
rible theatres, grand theatres. Suddenly
I was a star. I was in ‘Mr Tower of
London' for six and a half years . . .
“I began as a mimic, taking off vari-
ous people of the time, Gertie Gitana,
Charlie Chaplin from his films . . . Years
later, I heard Gertie imitating me. I
cried for nine days. You see, I didn't
realise how far I’d come ...”
I asked her about 1940, the year she
was accused by a Labor MP in Parlia-
ment of leaving England with jewels and
money in excess of the amounts allowed
by the defence regulations, and of de-
serting England for America in an hour
of need, fleeing London just before the,
Luftwaffe’s bombings of London, i’ress
criticism of her—she had made national
headlines—had been bitter and fierce
and I wondered how she felt about that.
“Well, I always thought the Press
made a big fuss about me leaving Eng-
land to cover up the terrible things hap-
pening at Dunkirk. I took £2O out and
they made it £200,000, and I took
£lO,OOO worth of jewellery and they
made it £lOO,OOO worth. They said my
husband Monty Banks —he was Italian —
was a Fascist. I had to go to America
where he could get citizenship. I toured
Canada raising war funds, and I told
them in England, ‘you can have every-
thing I earn . . but the Press was still
hard on me.
“I knew I would have to go back to
England to do my part. So I said to
Monty, ‘l’m going. If they don’t like
me I’ll come straight back.’ And in
1941 I did go back and sang at the
factories. They told me, ‘You’d better
not, you'll get a raspberry’. But I didn’t
get one. You see, only the Press was
against me. Not the people. And
Churchill told the critics to shut up . .
Since the war, Gracie Fields had seen
a different England, and she grimaced
when I mentioned its post-war develop-
ment. What did she make of the new
trend in entertainment there? “I don’t
understand it or like it at all. These
new people all look a raggle-taggle lot
of rag-bags. They pull England down.
It makes me sad to see it. It all began
with Frank Sinatra . . .’’ She shuddered
slightly. For the first time, one sensed
a strong emotional reaction. Who
among modern entertainers, did she
like? “I don’t know ... I feel bewild-
ered by it all . . . lost ...” She frowned
heavily, adrift in a sea of long hair,
guitars and screams, an entertainer who
had lived past her time. One took a
wiid stab. Ella Fitzgerald? She re-
peated the name, stumbling over it
slightly. She said, vaguely, yes; but one
didn’t feel she cared very much. Then?
“Bruce Forsyte ...” Who? “Bruce
Forsyte . . . and a fellow named Brown
... he’s on a seaside show . . . fright-
fully refeened . . . Brown ... Oh what’s
his first name? Oh dear! I'll ask my
sister .. . oh, now 1 know! Harry
Worth, that’s it!”
The names meant nothing, but she
went on, talking about the few contem-
porary show business people she liked.
Had there, in her long career, been a
single moment that stood out, that she
would always remember? The eaves-

dropper behind leaned forward, her
breath hot on my neck, her mouth open.
For the first time in 40 minutes’ con-
versation, Gracie Fields didn't hesitate.
“Bougainville, 1945,” she said firmly.
“I was dressed up like any Australian
soldier. Little me all crumpled in an
Aussie hat. They asked me to sing.
Suddenly everyone was cheering and

The Maher Magistrate
“A most unenviable position ”
By HUGH CURNOW
The job was never a simple one. But
Mr A. E. Stonham told The
Bulletin on the eve of his retire-
ment as Sydney’s Chief Stipendiary
Magistrate that there were times during
the Maher case, for example, when he
felt that his role as CSM had never
seemed quite so tricky. It was the poli-
cal overtones of that case he found most
oppressive.
“Not only did I have to appear to
dispense justice but I also had to make it
quite clear that I was not any sort of
political puppet,” he said. “In fact, there
was never any possibility of my being
used politically but the public had to be
made fully aware of that. That was not
easy. Suppose, for instance, that I had de-
cided to discharge
Mr Maher before
the Crown sought to
reopen the case
with Miss McCau-
ley’s statement. If I
merely discharged
him and left it at
that everyone would
suspect my motives.
Yet it would have
been extremely diffi-
cult to announce my
reasons fully. The
Attorney - General
could always decide
to charge Mr Maher
in spite of my dis-
missal of him. Then my statements as to
why he should have been discharged, at
that stage, could have been prejudicial to
a jury ... If, on the other hand, I had
decided to commit Mr Maher for trial
(as I later did) I was not entitled to say
any more than just that. It was a most
unenviable position to be in, for any
magistrate.”
Mr Stonham first joined the Public
Service as a law clerk for a salary of £1
a week in 1916. Last week, seated at the
desk he was preparing to vacate in his
daylit room at the rear of Sydney's Cen-
tral Court of Petty Sessions, he said he
was very conscious of the antipathy that
used to exist between the Bar and the
Magistracy, but which he now claims is
disappearing. “Barristers seemed to scoff
at magistrates because they didn't con-
sider them qualified men. Lately there has
been a distinct improvement in this atti-
tude I am happy to say,” he smiled. Part
of that improvement Mr Stonham at-
tributes to the fact that now magistrates
must be either solicitors or barristers. But
more of it he believes is the result of
barristers mixing with magistrates at
functions arranged by the Magistrates’
Institute. “As president of the Institute I
made it my business to see that the Bar
met the Bench out of court. They never
used to mix much socially, you know.”
Mr Stonham, a mild-looking, silver-
haired man of medium height with clear
skin and youthful eyes, does not, at 65,
present an immediate picture of “Stun-
’em Stonham” (as he has been called).
While a magistrate he had, in his
time, advocated the introduction of com-
pulsory blood tests for drinking drivers in
NSW, deprecated “maudlin sympathy”
for errant motorists, declined to accept
some police evidence and said that, con-
trary to the then practice, if a police
officer committed an
offence he should be
immediately charged
“like anyone else”
instead of a senior
officer’s permission
being required.
“If I had any
doubt about a po-
liceman's evidence I
invariably dis-
charged the defend-
ant. I don't like the
idea of prima facie
cases. Unless I felt a
man could possibly
be proven guilty I
would discharge
him. Police witnesses are trained obser-
vers and should be treated as such,
but there was no ‘sacred cow’ aura
about their evidence as far as I was con-
cerned. It had to stand up under cross-
examination like any other man’s. If it
didn’t out! Truth stands up in court.
You get to recognise liars even when
they're in uniform,” he said. He added
that the bulk of police evidence he had
heard had been reliable and helpful.
Compulsory blood-tests were the best
way for a magistrate to be sure of evi-
dence as to a driver’s drinking, he went
on. “After all, a policeman can say a
driver’s eyes were bloodshot and his
breath smelt of liquor but a definite scien-
tific report can be a much more reliable
guide than any policeman.”
About rates of pay for magistrates, Mr
Stonham said that if they were paid on
the basis of seniority of position-rather
than service he would have been earning
£6OOO a year since his appointment as
CSM three years ago. “Actually I got
£4651 a year plus £52 expenses that were
supposed to cover even taxi fares!” Con-

THE PRINCELY HOLIDAY
ditions had improved over the years,
however. When, after 30 years’ public
service as various court clerks and
Chamber Magistrate (excluding two
years’ Army service in World War I) he
was appointed Police Magistrate at Mud-
gee in 1947, he had some 13 districts to
handle alone —from Penrith to Baradine.
“I used to leave home on a Sunday night
and not return until Wednesday. Travel-
ling all the time. It was too much alto-
gether so I got the system revised down
to workable areas.” One cumbersome
area of control still persists, though. Un-
til his retirement it was Mr Stonham’s
responsibility to supervise the so-called
“Metropolitan Magistrates”. These num-
ber 45 but only some are in the metro-
politan area. The rest are in Newcastle,
Wollongong, Katoomba, Gosford and
Wagga Wagga.
Shortly after his Mudgee appointment
the official phrase “Police Magistrate”
was changed to “Stipendiary Magistrate”
and the “Police Courts” became “Courts
of Petty Sessions”. Mr Stonham approved
those changes. “A stipendiary, or paid,
magistrate is what we are. We are not in
the police force. Our courts are not police
courts,” he told me with some of the
verve he usually reserved for court ver-
dicts.
Miss Shepherd’s reputation
T>efore he decided to hear the Maher
case himself, Mr Stonham, who
has survived two heart attacks, was
concerned more about the effects of any
possible repercussions it might have on
his Bench than his health. Now he is
concerned about the effects it has had on
Miss Elizabeth Shepherd's reputation.
“I feel very strongly about the rights
of a witness whose character has been
attacked. If there is an opportunity for
her character to be just as publicly
repaired then she should have it. I said
as much on the final day of the hear-
ing at the same time as I ruled that
parts of Miss McCauley’s written state-
ment were admissible. Miss Shepherd’s
good name had been damaged in a ser-
ies of front-page newspaper reports of
witnesses’ evidence against her.” He
thought it “regrettable” that his state-
ment that his committing Mr Maher for
trial had restored Miss Shepherd's credit
was not given similar front-page pub-
licity. “One of the sadder aspects of that
case was what happened to Miss Shep-
herd’s reputation,” he added.
Sympathy with both witnesses and
accused was part of Mr Stonham’s
reputation as a magistrate. The number
of men whom he has censured from the
Bench who later have called to see him
and thank him is regarded as no small
achievement by welfare workers.
One achievement he did not elaborate
on was his admission last year to the Bar.
Despite other demands on his time (he is
chairman of both the ABC Disciplinary
Appeals Board and the Official Visitors
to Psychiatric Hospitals), Mr Stonham
determined to pass the Bar examinations
before his retirement and today is both
a solicitor and a barrister. “I would like
to practise now and may do so. But
of course,” he added drily, “I am not
allowed to plead a case here at Central
Court —for obvious reasons.”

Who Am I?
Reviewing the Reviewers
By D. R. HORNE
After reading reviews of The Lucky
Country I find myself facing a
crisis in personal identity: Who am
I?
The most extreme views on this trivial
question came, as one might have expec-
ted, from Melbourne. Writing in the
Melbourne Guardian Judah Waten said
I was “one of Australia's extreme Right-
wing journalists”. Writing in the Mel-
bourne Age Gerald Mayhead said that I
was a typical . “working class, left-of-
centre journalist”. To support his view
Judah Waten produced what he said was
my history of “anti-Communist tirades”
and “vicious attacks” on the Labor
movement and “the democratic tradi-
tion in Australian literature”. To sup-
port his view Gerald Mayhead found
inferential evidence in The Lucky
Country of my “bigotry”—against “the
British influence, the monarchy, good
schools, Sir Robert Menzies, landed
families and old money”.
Another Melbourne reviewer made the
grossly false and defamatory statement
that “Donald Horne and his friends wear
pork pie titfers”.
In The Sydney Morning Herald H. G.
Kippax found it necessary to reveal that
“Mr Horne has long been leading an
active gadfly existence in Sydney”. It’s
one of those looney things that happen:
Because I had saiu in the prologue to
The Lucky Country that I decided to
write it after “I c?me back from a trip
to the Far East last year” Harry Kippax
spent one sixth of his review discussing
the possibility that readers might think
that by this I meant that I had been in the
Far East for years.
He also seemed determined to warn
the innocent reader that The Lucky
Country was old stuff, if brightly re-
phrased. He went so far as to point out
that I was not the first person to criticise
the “White Australia” policy and Austra-
lia's British connection.
In The Canberra Times Maurice Dun-
leavy was so concerned, like Harry Kip-
pax, with denying The Lucky Country
The Bulletin asked Donald Horne,
author of the best-selling Penguin The
Lucky Country, to give his reactions
to the reviews of his book.
any novelty that he said that I was the
Rip Van Winkle of my generation. (Ac-
cording to this term, P. R. Stephensen
and J. F. Archibald were the Rip Van
Winkles of their generations.) He then
mystified those who have remembered
their Washington Irving by saying that
“in every generation a Rip Van Winkle
has awakened in Australia and found the
rest of his country asleep”.
I might add here that if Rip Van
Winkles Archibald, Stephensen and
Horne all arose from their sleep and had
the same vision the first two gentlemen
must have shown great intuitive insight
into the future; as all the other reviewers
pointed out, one of the central points of
The Lucky Country was that Australia
can't get through on luck alone when
faced with an involvement in modern
Asia and with the demands of modern
technology.
My identity crisis collapsed into happy
schizophrenia when Peter Coleman re-
viewed The Lucky Country in The Bul-
letin. He found in The Lucky Country
a large cast consisting of Horne the Pro-
phet of Doom, Horne the Man of Confi-
dence, Horne the Puritanical Censor,
Horne the Hedonistic Pagan, Horne the
Tub Thumper, Horne the Patriot, Horne
the Journalist and Horne the Poet of the
People.
lan Turner (in The Australian) made
relevant use of personal detail. He ex-
plained that I held a Sydney intellec-
tual’s view of how life goes on. I was not
a bull (with a Right Horne and a Left
Horne) but a unicorn who does not see
society “through Melbourne class-tinted
spectacles”.
The point that interests me is this:
do personal details about the author mat-
ter when reviewing a book? If a view is
represented in a book that has some
history behind it (a “Sydney view”, for
example) a reviewer might quite properly
explain this. Otherwise he should forget
all about questions of personal identi-
fication and get on with reviewing the
book. Most readers are not likely to have
much interest in the effects of intellectual
in-fighting. They just want to read a book
review. And it might be worse for those
reviewers whose personal prejudices (as
opposed to their intellectual prejudices)
are very strong to choose not to review
a book that arouses their prejudices.
A controversy is developing in the
Communist press (no less) about this
very question of whether my background
matters when reviewing The Lucky
Country. Judah Waten came out at the
beginning of December with a dogmatic
denunciation. “It is hard to understand,”
he said, “why Penguins should think that
a book on Australia by Donald Horne
would hold any interest for the intelligent
Australian reader . . . The Lucky Country
... is not only reactionary, but full of
trivia. It shows not an ounce of under-
standing.” However, six weeks later Mal-
colm Salmon, a member of The Guard-
ian’s staff, gave a different estimate of
what Party approaches to the book might
be. He suggested that although “Horne’s
credentials as a man of monopoly are im-
pressive”, The Lucky Country should be
judged by Party members on its merits.
Revisionism has come a long way since
the beginning of December.
If we were playing the game of making
quotes from reviews for an advertise-
ment for The Lucky Country, along with
Harry Kippax's memorable hard sell (my
favorite quotation from the reviews):
“Here, for Bs. 6d., is a handy little book
. . . which summarises many of the views
and theories which have appeared in the
past few years": we could place side by
side: “Probably the most astute and re-
vealing analysis of Australia that has
ever been written.” — Newsweekly (Na-
tional Civic Council). “Much of the
brightness is real insight and many of the
opinions of real value.” The Guardian
(Communist Party, Victoria).
I do not want to appear churlish. Some
reviewers were very kind to The Lucky
Country and some of the criticisms they
made were of great interest. Besides, the
book is selling very well. But reviewers
should themselves sometimes be re-
viewed. I know. I’ve written a lot of
reviews myself.


“Freud” Patterson’s Comeback
Now for the detestable Cassius Clay
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
As I took my seat in the working
Press rows at Ringside in Madison
Square Garden I was surprised to
see U Thant and Ralph Bunche, Num-
ber One and Number Two in the United
Nations, seated immediately behind in
the first row of the paid “ringside” seats.
Beyond them I spotted that old ring war-
horse, Gene Tunney, and his pal Bernie
Gimbel, now a pair of industrial tycoons.
Gene and Bernie don’t come out to the
Garden fights the way they did before
the TV era. I had never seen Thant and
Bunche at any sporting event except the
tennis finals at Forest Hills, which is a
semi-diplomatic affair because of the'
international overtones. Obviously this
was an occasion with the capital O.
Norman Mailer came in and sat in
the Press row, as he always does when
Floyd Patterson is fighting. The novelist
qualifies as “working Press” because of
his affiliation with “Esquire”. All tickets
to the 19,000-seat arena had been sold
three days before and the hustlers and
hawkers were thick at the entrance, try-
ing to buy extra tickets, as I made my
way in from Eighth Avenue. The
mounted police were clopping about, try-
ing to create some order out of the chaos
of arriving taxis and limousines. The
fight mob, with their unerring instinct
for the true and the beautiful, had sensed
something more than met the eye in the
scheduled twelve-rounder between Floyd
Patterson and Chunky George Chuvalo,
a Croat from Toronto.
As it turned out, the bout provided
one of the more memorable nights in
the long history of the “sweet science”.
To put the Garden scene into per-
spective, it must be realised that former
world heavyweight champion Patterson,
a complex, inhibited albeit intelligent
Negro (an English boxing writer call-
ed him Freud Patterson), has been in
the process of making a comeback in
boxing after two shaming first-round
knockouts by bully-boy Sonny Liston. In
the course of the comeback Patterson
had conquered three opponents, two in
Sweden and one in Puerto Rico, and was
now taking on Chuvalo, a little-known
but durable journeyman, as a further
step toward his ultimate goal of fighting
either Cassius Clay, the current cham-
pion, dr his old tormentor, Liston, for
the title.
It must also be realised that profes-
sional boxing in this country, where it
once flourished, had fallen upon evil
days indeed. That electronic ogre, tele-
vision, had put minor fighting arenas out
of business and swallowed up talented
boxers so fast that the sport had wither-
ed to the point of starvation. Several
recent ring fatalities, notably the killing
of Benny Paret in this same Garden ring,
had been witnessed by millions of TV
viewers in the intimacy of their lounge-
rooms, and deeply shocked them. A cry
had gone up for the outlawing of the
“blood sport”. A legislative committee,
formed after the Paret death, had very
nearly recommended the legal prohibi-
tion of professional boxing in New York
State. Most important of all, the cur-
rent champion, a clownish, racist-minded
egoist christened Cassius Clay but now
insistent upon being called Muhammid
Ali, his Black Muslim pseudonym, had
offended the American public with his
antics since winning the title from an-
other equally abhorrent type. Sonny
Liston, a savage ex-convict with a per-
sistent habit of assaulting - police and
approaching women at night in lonely
places.
But, this night, in the nrightly-lit ring
of Madison Square Garden Floyd Pat-
terson found his greatest moment of
glory, even though he failed to put
Chuvalo down or out. The two men
fought twelve astonishingly fast-paced
rounds, the final three reaching a cres-
cendo of violence that had the mob on
its feet like some vast animal, shrieking
the ancient cries of the bear-pit and the
Roman Colosseum. “Let's go, Floyd!”
the crowd yelled as the former cham-
pion zeroed in with hooks and crosses to
the cheeks and eyes of the ever-advan-
cing Canadian, who in turn pounded
ceaselessly at Patterson’s bruised body.
The verdict of the judges was unani-
mously in favor of Floyd and the crowd
loudly agreed.
Standing in the middle of the ring
he turned and threw kisses with his
gloved hands to the cheering audience
—a gesture of extreme abandon for this
ordinarily withdrawn individual. In his
dressing-room afterward he told the
writers proudly: “I proved that I can
take a punch to those of you who wrote
I had a cheese chin.” Then came a
typically Patterson afterthought: “But I
feel my opponent came out of the fight
with more distinction than I did. He is
a very tough competitor.”
The crowd and the Press (represent-
ing nine foreign nations as well as the
American hinterlands) did not agree with
Patterson’s modest evaluation. They
greeted his skilful performance against
the burly Canadian as atonement for all
that had gone before. Suddenly Pat-
terson became the kind of folk hero he
never was as champion. He, of course,
had his own answer for that too: “It’s
not that they like me for what I’ve done,
so much as they dislike Clay and Liston
for the bad things they’ve done.”
Cassius Clay, who had sneered at
Patterson as “the rabbit” and taken car-
rots and lettuce-to his training camp,
admitted he had been wrong. “Floyd
deserves a shot at my title,” he yelled.
The fight had not been seen on tele-
vision in New York or in any homes
but on closed-circuit TV in scattered
theatres in the US and Canada, yet its
impact was widespread. The Press un-
animously hailed it as an upward turn
for the battered old sport. “Boxing up
off the floor,” headlined “The New York
World-Telegram” the following morning.
The bout was a financial as well as an
artistic success, with Chuvalo earning
£40,000- —more than he had garnered
in all his previous thirty bouts—and
Floyd adding twice that to his already
sizeable fortune.
But one swallow does not make a
summer and one good fight does not
revive a moribund sport. There will be
a tremendous upsurge of interest in
everything Patterson does from now on.
A confrontation with the hated Clay
would probably produce the greatest
“gate” in boxing history. But there is
no blinking the facts that there are only
2000 registered professional boxers in
this country today (compared to more
than 7000 in boxing’s heyday in the
nineteen-twenties), and only 28 func-
tioning boxing clubs and arenas, as com-
pared to 654 before television’s blight
struck the sport.

OVERSEAS
Getting Ho off the Fence
The Kosygin Mission to Hanoi
By EMERY BARCS
The Soviet delegation to be dis-
patched to North Vietnam is a
top-ranking multi-purpose team,
including some of the best talent the
Kremlin can muster for talking Ho Chi-
minh back on to the fence which he
abandoned for the Red Chinese side
about a year ago.
Besides Prime Minister Aleksei N.
Kosygin the three other outstanding
members of the mission are: Yury V.
Andropov, Secretary of the Central
Committee and chief expert in inter-
national party relations; Vasily V.
Kuznetsov, First Deputy Foreign Minis-
ter and an old hand in Far Eastern affairs
(he designed Red China's first Five Year
Plan); Air Chief Marshal and Deputy
Defence Minister, Konstantin A.
Vershinin in charge of foreign military
aid. Kosygin is a member of the party
Presidium, the other three are in the
Central Committee.
Officially the Kosygin mission has
been “invited” in return for the visit
of Le Duan (first secretary of the North
Vietnamese Lao Dong [Communist]
party) and three members of the Polit-
buro, to Moscow in February, 1964. On
their way this delegation stopped in
Peking for instructions and in Moscow
they opted for Peking.
What else could they do? Mr Khrush-
chev, fed up with watching Ho Chi-
minh’s balancing act between Peking
and Moscow, had previously cut down
Soviet military and economic assistance
to North Vietnam and recalled most of
the Russian technical experts. This was
intended as a warning but was under-
stood as a threat. Besides there were the
unalterable facts of geography: Red
China was near, Russia far away. And
the campaign in South Vietnam was
being fought with Chinese not with
Soviet support.
Although it is more likely
that the Russians have invited
themselves than that they were
asked, the North Vietnamese
are interested in what the
Kosygin mission wants to offer.
The war in South Vietnam is
proceeding favorably enough
for Hanoi, but the costs are
prohibitive. The economic
situation in the North has been
bad for years and is not getting
better. The vast majority of the 18 mil-
lion people lives on a starvation diet, and
industrialisation plans are bogged down
by lack of capital and know-how. The
main hope is the conquest or “neutralisa-
tion” of the South. Moscow’s arms and—
above all—economic aid would be more
than welcome, provided the price is ac-
ceptable by Peking which has certainly
the last say in the matter.
The Sino-Soviet dispute has divided
the Lao Dong into three groups. Ho
Chi-minh, 75, himself would prefer to
be friends with both Moscow and
Peking; Le Duan and Truong Chih, the
party’s chief theoreticians, are now firmly
on China's side; while General Giap
(the victor of Dien Bien Phu and the
main developer of the Vietcong's tac-
tics) leans towards the Soviets. But all
three groups would accept Moscow’s
helping hand if this were possible.
Kosygin is probably authorised to set
the price of Soviet aid at a minimum.
For the main scope of his mission is to
regain some ground for the Soviets
among the Communists of Asia who
have been increasingly turning towards
Peking. Aidit of Indonesia is Mao’s man.
So is Kenji Mijamoto, lea'der of the
majority Communist group of Japan.
The pro-Chinese Communist party is
the stronger one in Ceylon and it is
steadily gaining ground against the
Moscow-oriented Communists in India.
Help given to, and accepted by
North Vietnam from Russia
would prove that the Kremlin
(contrary to Chinese charges)
is not only interested in foster-
ing the “anti-imperialist” revo-
lution in Asia but is willing to
support it actively.
Kosygin will certainly try to
persuade Ho Chi-minh to send
some representatives to the
preparatory meeting of the
great conference of 90 Communist par-
ties. This preparatory meeting, to which
26 parties have been invited, has had
to be postponed several times. Origin-
ally it was planned for May, 1964, and
the World Council of 90 should have
opened at the end of last year. Last
August the preparatory meeting was
postponed to December 15 and the
big meeting was scheduled for the mid-
dle of this year. Now the preparatory
conference is supposed to start on
March 1 in Moscow. So far no date
has been suggested for the World
Council.
But about one-third of those who
have been invited for March 1 are un-
likely to attend because they follow
Peking which has remained adamant in
its opposition to the plan. It would be
a major breakthrough if Ho Chi-minh
could be persuaded to make an appear-
ance, if not personally so at least by
sending a representative. Practically any-
one would do. Some of the waverers
may then follow suit and Moscow could
refute the charge that its insistence on
the conference is bound to split the
international Communist movement.
It was the Hungarian Premier, Janos
Kadar, who offered peace to his anti-
Communist nation by proclaiming that
“those who are not against us are with
us.” In Hanoi, Kosygin is likely to make
a similar offer to Ho Chi-minh. And
comrades Andropov, Kuznetsov and
Vershinin will be at hand to tell Ho
Chi-minh exactly how much it would be
worth to him if he left the Chinese plot
and climbed back on to the fence from
where he could have an equally good
view of Peking and of Moscow.

No—Brambles haven’t
entered that form of movement
service—yet!
But we did get to the count-down stage
recently with another new service for the industry
leaders of Western Australia.
Months had been spent in studying Western Australian
needs for a complete crane hiring service; the trends in
local manufacture and fabrication which would dictate
maximum lifting capacity, and the number of mobile cranes
necessary to provide a “never fail” year-round service.
For Dixon Bros. —the Brambles team in Western Australia
—the Christmas holiday period was an ideal time to take
delivery of the first cranes of a brand new fleet being
introduced into that State.
With the equipment on hand, thoroughly inspected and
tested, and the “backroom” planning complete, the service
was ready to be launched in the New Year. The leaflets
illustrated were used to advise the industries of Western
Australia of the new service ... the latest crane fleet was
off the ground.

COUNTRY NEWS,
[BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.]
(from oub own correspondents.)
BENALLA, Thursday.
Information of a somewhat startling
character has oozed out to the effect that the
police have the Kellys almost under their eye
in the neighbourhood of the King River, but
that their capture could not be effected even
by a hundred armed men on account of the
almost unapproachable position occupied by
the gang. It is said that the outlaws can
command a view for miles around, and any
attempt to approach them would be highly
dangerous. It is said the police are holding
on expecting to starve their victims out.
The weather is showery and cold.

the contract to excavate for the prestige office block which

After removing thousands of tons of sandstone, Brambles
will alter the course of the Tank Stream, which passes

During the demolition work, Brambles found beneath some

A little bit of sunshine in Antarctica
Testing under load
1
i
Brambles invariably conduct extensive tests under normal
working conditions prior to commissioning any new equipment.
In this way, service failures arc reduced to a minimum.
Here a new heavy-duty low loader for the Brisbane Region of
Brambles Industrial Services undergoes tests with a full load
of Caterpillar earthmoving equipment prior to going into
service.
Sunshine, Victoria, is well
known as one of the leading
manufacturing centres in Aus-
tralia. At the recent Sunshine
Carnival procession a Brambles
extendable trailer carried equip-
ment for the 1965 Australian
Antarctic Expedition. An in-
genious item, built by Recar
Industries Pty. Ltd., displayed
on the float was a Mini-Minor
converted to run on snowtracks.
The Brambles trailer takes loads
up to 60 feet in length and with
its prime-mover, is over 70 feet
long on the road.
The float won first prize in the
Carnival, which was organised
to raise funds for a Spastic
Centre at Sunshine.


Each essential
to the other .
Brambles cannot operate without oil and
the other products provided by the
petroleum industry, but the oil industry
must rely on transport to supply them
with the equipment they need to pro-
duce their products. Before a Brambles
driver turns the ignition key of his
vehicle a vast amount of co-operation
between the transport industry, the oil
companies and fabricators is essential.
Each depends upon the other to manu-
facture, transport or produce the
petroleum products which are the life-
blood of the transport industry.
This co-operation was evident recently
when Brambles moved 2,000 tons of
pressure vessels, specialised pipe-work
and intricate parts of refinery plant
machinery, from Sydney to Brisbane.

The machinery was transported from

Brisbane.
The move involved more than 80 loads
by Brambles Transport Division vehicles,
each one presenting its own special
problems. Each piece of equipment had
to be handled with the care normally
accorded to fine crystal, despite the
size and weight of the loads.

No matter how unusual the shape, or

always manage to fit a load on to one
of their heavy haulage vehicles.
In Newcastle, this 85-ton crane girder
was trucked from the engineering
works of A. Goninan & Company
Limited to the B.H.P. steelworks.
The load was 22 feet 6 inches high
and measured 21 feet across. Lines-
men rode on the top of the load to
lift electricity wires. A set of boom
railway gates at a level crossing had to
be dismantled to allow the load to pass.


Letters to the Editor
“The Ordeal of Peter Thomson”
PETER THOMSON
The letters
below are some
of the reactions
to Patrick Ten-
nison’s article
on Peter Thom-
son (“The Bul-
letin”, January)
30).
SlR.—Thank God for someone like the
Rev. Peter Thomson in Australia (8.,
Jan. 30). At last we are seeking to find the
content of religion instead of passively
enduring the sterile Pharisaic form of our
present religious structure. We have been
confronted far too long with the dilemma
of either losing our spiritual roots or
our roots in secular society. The person
of Jesus, called Christ, has had a peren-
nial fascination for Western man. Each
age reflects another facet of his charac-
ter. And so our age presses on to dis-
cover the secular, wine-bibbing, warm,
imperious “man for others”.
, John B. Cox
Rostrevor (bA).
SIR. —With reference to Patrick Tenni-
son's article, “The Ordeal of Peter
Thomson”, 1 should like to consider
some of the impressions it conveys to
me, a private reader who does not see
himself attached to any religious estab-
lishment. Its most valuable contribu-
tion lies in the fact that it gives a
balanced summary of the factors lying
behind my colleague's statement on
ABV-2’s “People ’64” to the effect that
he was an atheist. For those who were
disturbed by it, here is something of its
rationale, albeit one of extremely diffi-
cult theological terminology. Its second
useful aspect is that the author has
obviously acquainted himself with the
theologians from whom Peter Thomson
has gleaned his ideas, namely Barth,
Tillich, Bultman, Bonhoeffer and others.
This means that the casual reader has
before him a brief resume of roughly
where the Church stands today.
However, what I should like to ques-
tion is what on earth is meant by the
title of the article, “The ORDEAL of
Peter Thomson"’. Although it is a nice
piece of bait for the reader, it is not
one which is at all considered in the
article itself! But, then, perhaps the
author did not himself coin the phrase?
So, then, may 1 enquire, “ordeal” over
what and with whom? 1 suspect that
the word is meant to point us to some
fierce tension between the “radical”
ideas of Peter Thomson and those of
the “religious establishment”. If that
suspicion is correct, then may I point
out that these ideas are very widely
held in varying degrees by a consider-
able number of churchmen on all levels
of the Church's power structure, even
here in Australia.
Here are just a few examples: At
his last Synod Charge, the Rev.
Dr F. Woods, Anglican Archbishop of
Melbourne, devoted half his time to a
favorable consideration of these new
“secular'’ insights. Again, only a month
ago, some 50 clergy and laity from
several denominations gathered under
the auspices of “Australian Frontier”
in Brisbane to seriously examine some
of their implications. Present were
several men holding key positions in
their respective churches. Furthermore,
recently, the Rev. Marius Gerson,
a well respected Presbyterian theo-
logian, spoke on HSV-7’s “Fighting
Words” in full agreement with Sir Mar-
cus Oliphant’s happy observation that
“religion is steadily decaying away”.
(Sir Marcus is himself an Anglican lay-
man.) To these, I would add the fact
that, ten years ago, as a university
undergraduate, I first came in contact
with this “radical thinking” in the
Student Christian Movement. Even
then these new insights were far from
being new.
Now the implication behind all this
is that, in fact, Peter Thomson has no
“ordeals” to face on a theological level,
and even if that were the case, then he
has a large number of friends in the
Church. This means, then, that any
existing tension for him, or for any-
body, lies not in the content of ideas
but over the means used to communi-
cate them to the general public. In-
deed there is tension, because it belongs
to the very nature of things. The
prophet will feel the need to speak out
and unsettle people, while the pastor
will work quietly alongside people, re-
cognising their limitations and lack of
insight—accepting them. So the ques-
tion becomes one of strategy, i.e., when
and where one chooses to debate these
issues with others.
The “ordeal” then lies, in this case,
not so much with the fearful reactionary
authorities but in having to live with
these new insights, discussing them only
when people appear capable of a
response and remaining silent when a
listener is mentally unable to cope with
their radical implications.
May I then conclude by questioning
the article’s a priori assumptions?
Firstly, that “no other Australian
churchman . . . has been willing to raise
these points”—because, in fact, many
people have been quietly doing so for
a long time. Secondly, that “to say
something, however inadequate, is bet-
ter than silence”, because there are times
when we ought to speak strongly, and
times when we ought to be gentle and
quiet.
The Rev. Peter Hollingworth
Brotherhood of St Laurence.
Fitzroy (Vic.).
SIR. —The “ordeal of Peter Thomson"
is the same ordeal that Bishop Robinson
experienced when he wrote “Honest to
God”—that is, how to explain in simple
language what must surely be the truth.
Like Huxley I experienced the same
enormous sense of spiritual relief which
came at the rejection of the idea of God
as a supernatural being, yet my faith
and belief in the Presence of God, such
as Thomson and Robinson understand,
became more vivid and understandable.
After reading Tillich, Bonhoeffer,
Robinson, etc. —all of them works diffi-
cult to comprehend at the first reading—
the most significant contribution to my
peace of mind was a non-Christian say-
ing found in passing through a paper-
back novel. It was, “the eye with which
I see God is the same eye with which
God sees me”. Here I think we have
the beginning of our understanding of
a God who is not “an old man in the
sky” but the Ground of all Being whose
manifestation is most evident in the pre-
sence of Love.
Whilst God is more real to me now
than at any former period in my life, I
find difficulty in attending Church ser-
vices which still persist with the old
idea of God. At this stage of my search,
Church has become a barrier because I
can’t understand its vocabulary. It is
like waking up one morning and finding
yourself thinking and speaking in French
whilst everyone else is still thinking and
speaking in English. What joy it is to
pick up The Bulletin from time to
time and see that there are other
Frenchmen around. A reformation is
coming like a gathering storm and
Christians everywhere must be ahead of
it preparing its course to answer that
total destruction of all we hold dear is
not the result.

SIR.—In the article on Peter Thomson,
you wrote about his “recent months of
worry over inward and outward argu-
ments”. May I humbly suggest that,
as he is “Cure of Souls” to the youths
whom he seeks to help, he try to resolve
his doubts on The Trinity and modify
his didactic views on “the pre-scientific
Creed”, as undermining faith may nul-
lify any good he may achieve. The
silence of the Australian clergy on the
rambling rodomontade of the Bishop
of Woolwich and his Australian echo is
apparently attributed to ulterior motives.
Instead of this, people could think that
there are times when “Silence is golden”.
I listened to Mr Thomson’s TV ses-
sion, and felt rather like a patron who
viewed an abstract painting, which had
inadvertently been put on exhibition
upside down: as far as understanding,
it didn’t seem to matter! For Mr Thom-
son said “only when you etch out the
god of supernaturalism can you discover
God”!

SIR.—It was refreshing to read of the
progressive views of the Rev. Peter
Thomson. What is amazing is that the
writer of the article, Patrick Tennison,
implies that there is something revolu-
tionary about this kind of thinking. My
hunch is that about 50 per cent of the
Australian clergy would hold similar
views to those of Mr Thomson. A con-
siderable number would probably be
even more radical in their thinking.
The weakness of the article lies, there-
fore, in a lack of perspective on the
issues involved. (Perhaps it takes a
little while longer in Melbourne for
generally well-known facts to reach the
public eye.)
What matters most of all in the Aus-
tralian Church is that we discover ways
of translating our theological discover-
ies into practical action. . It always
sounds wonderfully profound to hear
people talking about Bonhoeffer’s con-
cept of “the man for others”. And after
a while, hearing preachers quoting Til-
lich, Bultman, Barth and (invariably)
Kierkgaard becomes as wearisome as
listening to some fanatic quoting, with-
out discrimination, a string of Bible
texts. Not until, like Bonhoeffer him-
self, preachers cease verbalising and be-
come “men for others” will we see the
renewal of the Church. This will be
achieved only by forsaking the pathway
of dead institutions to venture, careless
as to the contempt of men, to work
among those who are in desperate need
of our ministries.

SIR.—As a former Methodist lay-
preacher I was intensely interested in
“The Ordeal of Peter Thomson”. I had
been accused of “blasphemy in the pulpit”
when preaching about Jesus. My ac-
cuser was a wealthy supporter of the
Church. “And what do you intend to
do about it? Throw me out of the
Church?” I asked the local minister.
“No. What you said about Jesus is
what this congregation needs to be told.
But I am too old to change to another
job; I have a family; I should be thrown
out of the Church; it would split the
Church in two; if I were to preach what
I believe about Jesus. But you laymen
can, and riuist, do this necessary job in
the Church.”
That was 30 years ago or more.
Apparently, an Anglican clergyman has
had the courage, and taken the risk, to
“do a necessary job”, about God.

Citizenship Convention
SIR. —As President of the Good Neigh-
bor Council of South Australia and
Chairman of the Good Neighbor ses-
sions of the recently held Citizenship
Convention in Canberra, I write to ex-
press my disgust at the cartoon by Tan-
ner (B., Jan. 30). The impression con-
veyed by the cartoon is of a gathering
of pompous and unpleasant individuals
condemning certain migrant groups in
Australia. Anyone present at the Con-
vention would agree with me that the
cartoon bears no relation to the tone of
the discussions, which were designed to
assist the integration of all newcomers
to Australia. This tasteless cartoon can
only do serious harm to the whole
migration programme and breed resent-
ment in those mentioned in the caption.

Topical Stage
SlR.—American “Variety” (5/2/64):
“This looks like being a useful contribu-
tion to Melbourne's meagre night-life,
and the present venture is good enough
to set a trend.”
Melbourne _“Sun” (27/1/64): “This is
the nearest we have ever come to the
type and quality of topical revue that
could succeed in Melbourne. It runs for
80 minutes of excellent entertainment.”
These quotes are from criticisms made
about the late-night intimate revue
“Every Child's Garden of Revue”, pro-
duced by Miss Barbara Angell, which
ran for four weeks at the Arts Theatre,
Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, and then,
because of its extreme popularity, was
transferred by Mr John Sumner to the
Russell Street Theatre for a season of a
further six weeks. All this took place be-
tween January and April, 1964 a year
during which your critic, in his round-up
of the year’s theatrical events in Mel-
bourne (8., Dec. 26), bemoaned the fact
that “topical stage is dead, intimate re-
vues non-existent.”
DAVID SALE
Woollahra {NSW).
The Skunk Hunters
SlR.—There are two minor errors in
“A Night with the Skunk Hunters”
(8., - Jan. 30) which are perhaps
of little consequence. 1. In the first
sentence of this article reference is
made to “Clifford’s Quay”. The author
obviously means either Clifford Pier or
Raffles Quay—both very close to each
other. 2. Reference is made in pass-
ing to tin mines in Penang (last para-
graph, centre column, page 21). There
are no tin mines in Penang.
These indicate a somewhat super-
ficial knowledge of Malaysia and make
the rest of the article slightly suspect.
This last feeling was, for me at least,
confirmed by the reference to Malacca:
“communities. of Parsees in spotless
whites; Jews and Arabs in dark, rich
silks; Bombay merchants in whites with
crimson girdles”. This is not Malacca,
but a bazaar in the Arabian Nights! It
paints an entirely false picture of Malay-
sia in 1965 and has no place in an article
depicting the state of semi-war existing
there today.

70 Miles from Hell
A refugee village of Queensland’s 1890s
By M. H. ELLIS
Any reader who wants to know where
Seventy Seven Mile (QCR) w'as in
the last years of the 19th century
need only put his finger on the map of
Queensland at the word “Dingo” and
move it eastward down the Central rail-
way to the word Tryphinia, which is its
modern name. The QCR part of it stood
for Queensland Central Railway and dis-
tinguished it from any other Seventy
Seven Miles there might have been about
the landscape. It w'as seventy seven miles
from Rockhampton. Its distance from
hell was probably less.
The Seventy Seven Mile, w'hen I knew
it, resembled a desolate beach towards
which the currerts of the Dawson River
tracks-flowed, carrying the human flotsam
and jetsam thrown loose from the after-
maths of the Great Shearers’ Strike and
the financial devastation of “ninety
three”. The population of the village
almost entirely consisted of the refugees
dislodged from the South-West in the
years 1894-7, and it had a hard time
getting there with its drays, or otherwise.
Not having fallen to pieces negotiating
the Expedition Range, and having left the
delusive Coomooboolaroo (which means
two W'ater holes) very thirsty, we, horse,
human, dog and dray, staggered into the
Seventy Seven Mile one hot summer’s
evening in a blaze of sheet lightning in
1896. It w'as the first railway station we
had seen for two years.
It consisted of a small siding, its
stationmistress's cottage bowered in the
usual covering of Central Queensland
railway buildings—a brilliant blaze of
bougainvillea. One or two goods trains
stopped there every day to drop mail or
meat, or pick up sleepers, and the mail
trains whistled through derisively.
Parallel with the railway was a long,
shallow, reedy lagoon or dam around
which at intervals were the residences of
Seventy Seven Mile —of assorted bark
or slab or derelict galvanised iron with a
mottled tent or a bough shade dotted
here and there. They scarcely had a
timbered floor between them, since ant-
bed and cow dung make a’ wonderful
foundation for a home.
Two lucky early arrivals had pre-
empted the sheltered side of the village's
two quandong trees, quandongs be-
ing compact vegetables that will not blow
down on your head and yet provide good
protection from the wind. Seeing that we
had a lady among us a bachelor gave up
one of these prize positions to us and,
what with the dray, tilt, a‘ bark hut and
a bough skillion for a kitchen, we were
very comfortable. Sanitary services were
provided by the wide open bush. There
were no water rates. If energetic, you
hauled the elixir of life out of a hole
called “the well'', scraped the bits of dead
possum and grasshoppers out of it. and
put it in a bucket with a shovel-full of
ashes overnight to clear. The result was
greenish, translucent and bitter. If you
were normally lazy, you dipped your

M. H. Ellis’s' reminiscences.

LETIN, January 9, 1965.
fluid out of the lagoon, sieved the tad-
poles out of it, and then applied the ashes
treatment. Either way, it was very
nourishing water.
The community at Seventy Seven Mile,
having arrived there the hard way, was
in itself pretty hard and experienced. Our
nearest neighbor on the left was a
whiskered, stocky old gentleman with a
large cattle dog named Bruiser and a
small daughter. When he took his dray
out to cart sleeper logs to the sawmill of
Jimmy Dido who had the railway con-
tract—he took his dog with him and left
his daughter behind chained to a sapling
—to prevent her wandering into the la-
goon to get drowned or swimming in the
altogether with the Ellis boys. These, in
any case, tired of getting her loose from
the sapling, after she had firmly refused
to allow them to shoot bows and arrows
at zamia fruits on her head, so that they
could prove that they were as good shots
as William Tell.
The bows and arrows were made from
the excellent lancewood round Seventy
Seven Mile which was manipulated with
technical skill by Old Mr Daniels who
claimed to have been a Forty Niner in
California and to have seen the Piutes
(or was it the Navajos?) scalp his mother,
a process which he was apt to describe
with lavish detail including reproduction
of the bloodthirsty screams of the
savages. There were those who cast
doubts on his tale, on the ground that
even the unsophisticated do not wait
around to gather local color when the
Piutes are tomahawking mothers; but, be
that as it may, he made very good bows

and arrows for which the recipients paid
in trapped parrots which the old back-
woodsman boiled lengthily for his dinner.
They used their weapons on the local
pleuro bull which was the only large, live
target they had a chance to assail. This
was unpleasant for the pleuro bull, but
did nobody else any harm in a region
where every male carried a lethal
weapon, usually a large-bore muzzle
loader ammunitioned with black powder,
pieces of the Rockhampton “Bulletin”,
and anything from glass marbles to bent
nails. Nothing furred or feathered and
larger than a sparrow was much of an
insurance risk in the Seventy Seven Mile.
Broad arrows
f|\tE trade of the dozen males of Seven-
A ty Seven Mile, as I have hinted,
was cutting logs for railway sleepers and
carting them to the sawmill of Mr Jimmy
Dido down near the eastern end of the
lagoon. The sawmill was a Heath Robin-
son affair which functioned according to
some system which nobody ever under-
stood, since it used a square, red
ship's tank for a boiler. All the timber
getters were supposed to have licences
and pay royalties on cut timber but they
were always away when the timber in-
spector called and he put broad arrows
on any logs he found lying about. After
he had gone, they came back and cut off
the government mark and delivered the
timber to Mr Dido to cut into sleepers,
he paying for it in promises, rations at
his own prices, and as much currency
mostly shinplasters —as was needed to
deter them from throwing him into the
lagoon.
The Seventy Seven Milers, of course,
were all English or Irish born, except a
couple of blackfellows who were acknow-
ledged to be Australian, one Swede, Mr
Dido who was Welsh, and Forty Niner
Daniels who was American and looked it.
Everybody would willingly have paid
royalties on timber if the Government
had been ready to give them unlimited
credit, which it wasn't. Thus, they were
grateful to the timber inspector for acting
up to the motto “Live and let live”.
Apart from his visits, the only other
regular incursions into the quiet of
Seventy Seven Mile were a trooper (who
never failed to cause consternation in
three or four camps, although he was
usually on the way to Tryphinia station to
investigate the latest cattle duffing for the
bank that had taken the property over)
and Mr Kidston and Mr Hardacre.
Mr Kidston was a newsagent who wore
a Scottish accent, a clean pointed beard,
a deerstalker and a black alpaca coat. He
took orders for the Rockhampton “Bul-
letin” from our two subscribers Mr
Dido and the community at large which


passed its copy round. He also carried in
a gladstone bag such cultural apparatus
as the community might need car-
penters’ pencils, penny bottles of ink and
threepenny writing pads. For the erudite,
he was prepared to take orders for W. T.
Stead's “Books for the Bairns*’, a comp-
rehensive library of penny literature in-
cluding everything from Burns’ Poems to
Macaulay's Essays. He took cash on the
nail, as befitted a future Treasurer of
Queensland, later Premier, founder of
Queensland University and its first
Honorary Doctor of Laws.
Mr Hardacre, our other regular visitor
(who also later became a Minister of the
Crown), was our local Labor member,
a sturdy squat man who had been born
in Dayton, Ohio, had lived in Springfield
(Ind.) when Lincoln was President, and
had'served in the Sudan War but only,
he insisted, being a democratic pacifist, as
a ship’s butcher.
Everybody in Seventy Seven Mile was
visible when Mr Hardacre came, because
everybody wanted something from him,
and rarely found him unforthcoming.
When one represents an electorate with
only 800 votes and thickly infested with
squatters and representatives of the banks,
one needs every vote one can collect.
Mr Hardacre was not only willing but in-
ventive in his devices to oblige us all.
One of his contrivances might be
termed the Great Agricultural Theory
which consisted of the premise that the
parched electorate of Leichhardt—Hard-
acre was a sound name for its MLA
consisted entirely of rich, fertile, black
loam watered perennially by the life-giv-
ing dews of Heaven. (In fact, even the
goannas were said to be in the hands of
the banks or pastoral supply companies.)
According to Mr Hardacre, all the elec-
torate needed to shame the Garden of
Eden with its fertility was for the Gov-
ernment to provide the natives with un-
limited quantities of the seed wheat, oats,
maize and beans (preferably dried).
So bags of wheat, maize and other
seeds, plus cowpeas, arrived in the
“Dingo goods” at intervals. They did not
produce waving fields of grain, but I can
testify that macerated with an axehead in
an oil drum they produced a most-
nourishing porridge. When flavored with
golden syrup and washed down with
goat's milk this was uncommonly good
for the digestion. That there were no
fields of waving corn was blamed on the
weather.
All the features of this story so far
would have been familiar to a hundred
rather desperate, half-starved little out-
back communities in the hard years be-
tween the disasters of “ninety-three” and
the “great drought of 1903”, when it was
a continual struggle to be fed and a lot
of people would not have been clothed
if they had not gone around wearing
garments which bore the label “Central
Milling Co., 251 b” or “Harper's Oat-
meal”.
One feature of the Seventy Seven Mile
not general, however, was its gallant
essay in education. This was due to the
conjunction of my mother, who was an
educated woman —of whom it w ; as com-
mon talk that she ow'ned a life of Mary
Queen of Scots in French, not to mention
Dr Arne's French Grammar with two
other persons. They both arrived on the
same evening. It was very wet and my
mother and I were camped about seven
miles from home on Bridgewater Creek
whence my father was carting a pile of
timber. About sundown it entered my
young mind that my mother was not her-
self, and just as it was getting dark, she
suddenly cried out to me to go for my
life up the line to find my father and any
woman I could find to bring back “except
Miss McClafferty” the station mistress. I
had not been brought up with black-
fellows and nature without having some
idea what was going on, and I burned up
seven miles of railway track as fast
as any seven-year-old boy ever did in
pelting rain, arriving at the Seventy Seven
Mile station house to find four fettlers
drinking tea with Miss McClafferty and a
dark stranger recently thrown off a train.
We all went back to Bridgewater on the
fettlers' trolley, with two brawny fettlers
working the handles and Miss McClaf-
ferty, whom wild horses would not have
kept from coming, cheering them on as,
she sat in the rain in her long, black
skirt and high net collar and pompadour.
There was a lot of noise and fuss, but on
arrival we found that my mother had pro-
duced a future sub-editor for the Mel-
bourne “Herald - ’ very neatly and without
bothering anybody.
This duty disposed of, she viewed the
dark stranger who had been waiting to
jump the Dingo rattler, complete with
torn tail coat and sugar bag luggage,
when news of her plight held him back.
And when he proudly announced that
he was an old boy of Lancing College
and his name proved to be connected with
the peerage my mother began to canvass
the idea that Seventy Seven Mile badly
needed a school, even if the infant popu-
lation of school age consisted only of
self and a young brother, two grand-
children of the Forty Niner, the en-
chained maiden and three small black
boys. (There was no color bar.)
It proved at once that the newcomer
was greatly in favor of the education of
the young and was willing to impart it in
return for rations and tobacco and a
camp, with the help of the First Royal
Reader, Hymns Ancient and Modern and
the Holy Bible. The only odd circum-
stance about the transaction was the
number of kerosene tins he needed to
prepare his cuisine.
The method of teaching which the Old
Boy of Lancing College practised was
original. His class sat on a form under a
tree beside his camp, moving round with
the shade, but allowing him to combine
culture with cookery in the kerosene tins
which he tended. He sampled these and
vvith a frequency that increased as the
day progressed, until, at its end, he
usually set us singing patriotic songs like
the one in which we said we loved our
native land the best, though no gold or
jewels here were found (fifty miles from
the world's greatest goldmine and from
Anakie sapphire field!). Also, the “Eton
Boat Song”.
Bush mead
his bubbling tins a sweet odor
emanated which squared with his ex-
planation that he was boiling “syrup”,
though tasting it seemed to produce a
slurring of his speech, which was ob-
viously infectious since nearly every male
inhabitant caught it from time to time.
It was not till my brother and I were
tempted to taste his syrup that the villain
was unmasked. Our arrival home tipsy
was only the culmination of a week in
which the Forty Niner had gone to the
railway and kissed Miss McClafferty who
slugged him with his own corned brisket
delivered in a sugar bag off the train,
and the Swede had fought his wife to a
standstill and two lusty citizens had
achieved their ambition and heaved Mr
Dido, the sawmiller, into the lagoon at
last. Mead made from bush honey and
lagoon water is a powerful potion.
It was disastrous, but fate hit the Ellis
family harder than anybody else. For in a
climactic calamity my father went out to
help a man cut down a tree and the
man did his part of the cutting on the
wrong side, having been one of the in-
vestigating committee up at the school-
teacher's camp that morning. The tree
naturally fell on my father. It broke only
a few ribs and split up his right hand, so
that the bone showed through on every
finger, and removed a bit of his scalp.
“Well, I didn't get my shirt torn,” he
announced when my mother w'ent out to
help' rescue him. So they tied him up as
best they could, cut a sheet of bark, and
carried him in it eight miles to the station
and my mother went with him down to
Rockhampton hospital. She came home
announcing that it was about time we got
a little nearer to civilisation of which she
had just had her first taste for many a
year.
So, packing our belongings into the
dray and harnessing our old seventeen-
hand mare and tying a few goats to the
tailboard we, as a novelist would say, set
our faces towards the sunrise. I suppose
everybody in Seventy Seven Mile has a
Holden now.


REVIEWS
TELEVISION
The Monster Business
By FRANK ROBERTS
The Addams Family. Channel 9, Sydney.
The Munsters. Channel 7, Sydney.
Beauty and the Beast. Channel 7, Sydney.
Grisly humor has been around a long
time in literature, drama, cartooning,
and in films which gave us monsters,
then had Abbott and Costello meet
them. It has now arrived in television
in most States, via “The Munsters” and
“The Addams Family”.
The Addamses of course owe their
general appearance, if little else, to
Charles Addams’ “New Yorker” draw-
ings. Addams makes his creatures funny,
in a way that has eluded Hannibal
Coons, the series’ writer. Perhaps the dif-
ference is that cartoonists try for a smile,
while television humorists seek to roll
’em in the aisles, adding taped laughter
to prompt the viewer.
The cartoon Addamses consisted of
an immaculately dressed, piggy-faced
little man, a gaunt woman in trailing
black, a Frankenstein’s monster butler,
two extraordinary children, a grey-haired
witch-type, and a bloodless, beady-eyed
male, every one of them medievally evil.
If Addams drew this crew in the act
of observing their child dressed for an
evening with the Boy Scouts, it was
ridiculous at a glance.
In television, “The Addams Family”
milked the same paradox for laughs over
the full 25-minute course and did little
better with it, even when helped by a
bemused child psychologist. John
Astin, as the embodiment of the piggy-
faced little man, plays it as Ernie Kovacs
might have, or Danny Thomas. He not
only looks harmless and jovial but finds
his most gruesome enjoyment in blowing
up toy trains. Carolyn Jones as the lady
in black has a conservatory full of
meat-eating plants but is otherwise only
abnormal in her acceptance of the
abnormal as normal. Jackie Coogan
plays the beady-eyed gent as though
vaudeville were still with us. And so
on.
The Addamses wring a certain amount
of humor from an abnormal outlook,
but sometimes it’s a pretty dry cloth
they're wringing, as when Miss Jones
mutters, “I should have bought black
curtains, they’re so much more cheer-
ful”. But then, as the song at the begin-
ning of each episode tells us, the
Addamses are not so much Spooky as
Ooky, an opinion with which I would
not quibble.
Personally, I could stand fewer
Addamses and more of their butler,
aptly named Lurch, whose great height,
long, sombre face, and deep echoing
voice make him a fine comic invention.
Oddly enough he is non-Addams, re-
placing the Boris Karloff-like butler of
the cartoons.
This true son of Frankenstein is the
husband, Herman, in the Munster
family. Herman is a gentle, sentimental
giant. His wife Lily, nee Dracula, is
also too weird to be evil. They have
one normal adult daughter, and a small'
son who is not sent to bed but to his
coffin each evening. Gran'pa Munster
does a little black magic, alchemy, were-
wolfing, and so forth. The Munsters
live in a forbidding mansion, but unlike
the Addamses have few props to lean
on. Much of their line or humor con-
sists of being perfectly honest and frank,
and surprised at other people’s surprise.
The Munsters’ humor, if that’s the
word, is more on the gruesome side than
the Addams’, with such quips as “the
only bank where Gran’pa has ever been
overdrawn is the blood bank”, and
“money? No, Gran’pa was one person
who managed to take it with him—but
he forgot to bring it back”.
Now that the invasion of funny mon-
sters has begun, we are left to wonder
how far it will go, or where it might end.
In a folksy series called the “Horse-
less Headsman of Creepy Holly”, a
western series titled “Bats Masterson”,
or a wildly funny crime series called
“The Unthinkables”? Or will the trend
become diluted, as in the series “Be-
witched”, on view in Melbourne, and
derived from the play, “Bell, Book and
Candle”?
Will Australia be able to produce such
a series? In truth, I thought it had,
when, during this investigation of
macabre hilarity in television, I chanced
on a local production called “Beauty
and the Beast”.
Here I saw five people seated in a
possibly cabbalistic arrangement of
desks, and apparently ready to examine
some wretch with the help of as yet
invisible torturers. It seemed a daring
enough notion, but as the show got
under way it gradually became clear that
the only person about to be tormented
was me. The Beast, it seemed, was
Eric Baume, who kept smiling straight
at me like my grocer when about to un-
load a new high profit item or suggest it
might be time to pay a little on account.
“Now here’s a question from ‘Besot-
ted’ of Queensland,” said Mr Baume,
beaming 150 watts of charm at me.
“She says: ‘I am an eau de cologne
addict. 'Can’t stop using lashings of the
stuff on my clothes, in the cooking, even
as polish on the furniture. My husband
threatens to leave me, in a hearse. What
can 1 do?’ ” Glaring bestially to his
left, Mr Baume said, "Don't laugh. This
is serious. You, Agatha?”

The Alvin Alley American Dance Theatre,
with Brother John Sellers. Second pro-
gramme. Tivoli Theatre. Sydney.
The new programme presented by the
Alvin Ailey Dance Co. included choreo-
grapher Anna Sokolow’s work “Rooms”.
This astringent foray into the realm of
human loneliness was acclaimed in 1955
when it was first produced in New York.
Unusual, stark, it penetrates beneath the
surface-consciousness of man. It re-
veals a state of mind which lonely city
dwellers experience. It is the supreme
aloneness of being in a crowded sub-
way at 5 p.m., or a tenement on a
stifling hot summer’s night. It ap-
proaches “non-dance” in that the tre-
mendous facility of technique possessed
by this group of dancers is never called
upon. It lies hidden while the mood-
thoughts in Miss Sokolow’s asymmetical
patterns are bared. “Rooms” has been
called a classic, and it is in the reper-
toire of a number of first-class com-
panies.
The first item on the programme was
a moodly lament of lyric beauty; plas-
tic patterns spiralled, curved, melted,
wept and softly made their exit. This
was the “Lament” of Louis Johnson.
Then followed Alvin Ailey’s solo
group to "his own work “Hermit Songs”.
These were subjective, in a solemn,
almost passive mood of concentrated
gentleness.

ART
Eyewash
David Blackburn. Watters Gallery. Sydney.
Mixed Show. Barry Stern Gallery. Sydney.
Whereas a good landscape gives us a
cleansed vision of nature, David Black-
burn, at the Watters Gallery, gives us
mostly eyewash. His luminous black
pastels are shot through with screeching
swathes of swirling white that dazzle the
viewer by playing ping-pong with his
eyeballs. To Blackburn, light is to his
picture as a good tenor is to a bad
opera; everything. On his attempts
accurately to note the watt instead of the
why of nature Blackburn functions as a
self-effacing secretary to the most im-
possible of dictators. Impossible, be-
cause light cannot exist in painting, only
in nature. Any attempt to portray it
must fail. At best it will result in a
description or imitation of a phenomena
outside the reach or need of painting.
For the artist there is only color, form
and space. And then not what they
look like but what they do. Though
sensitive, Blackburn’s documentations of
trees and shrubs amount to no more
than an interesting inventory. Every-
thing he paints has its exact equivalent
in the material world. But life is not
art and art is not life; it is a glimpse of
the miraculous hidden behind the ap-
pearance which life presents.
Barry Stern’s mixed show is another
of those routine withdrawals from the
stock-room blood bank designed to
boost anaemic sales. Thirteen dissi-
milar painters confront each other with
so wide a range of incompatible pre-
mises that their hits and misses tend to
cancel each other out. Some hits:
Elwyn Lynn's curious combination of
plug-ugly PVA and glittering gold leaf
successfully plays patina against paste,
heightening the special qualities of each;
Daryl Hill’s Hiroshimaesque mushroom
cloud discharging its crackling energies,
though unhelpfully titled “Fishing”, is an
example of “Action Painting” with water
color where there is as - much action as
painting; Andrew Sibley’s hard-boiled
city-scape of a blackened mass of shri-
velling hovels ruinously basted with a
viscous coat of sludge and varnish seems
cooked rather than painted in oils. Still,
the work represents a genuine vision of
urban decay and would have been more
effective if he had left the truth un-
varnished.
Some misses: Sheila McDonald's
stretched hessian and collage. She
handles her New Guinea portrait with
the same finesse one expects to find in
passport photos. Donald Friend’s feline-
looking male nudes languorously blended
into an androgynous unity that is neither
either/or.

MUSIC
Mixed Blessing
“Prom” Concerts. Town Hall. Sydney.
Judged by the first two of the new
“Prom” series, these concerts are not
wholly a blessing. The SSO, fresh after
their annual recess and now led by youth-
ful Donald Hazelwood, performed very
well under John Hopkins' enthusiastic
direction—even those sections which still
seemed weak in 1964 have reached quite
a decent standard. The programming,
generally in the London tradition, was
very conservative. In each programme
there was one new work - new to
Sydney at any rate —but the rest was
routine. Thus, in the first concert, there
was Webern’s Opus 6, “Six Pieces”, writ-
ten in 1909. Atonal, yet emotionally
highly-charged, these intricately orches-
trated miniatures are exceedingly attrac-
tive and were well presented despite their
difficulties. For the rest, there was
Dvorak's “New World” symphony in a
competent and rather unimaginative
reading and Mozart’s lovely Sinfonia
Concertante (introduced to Sydney audi-
ences by Thomas Matthews and William
Krasnik in 1944), with Ernest Llewellyn
and Robert Pikler as soloists. I am sure
that I have heard better performances of
this work from other orchestras, conduc-
tors and violinists, but never more poetic
and assured viola-playing than Pikler's.
The second concert proved the most
boring in a long time. The “new” work
was Alban Berg’s “Seven Early Songs”,
a romantic cycle written in the com-
poser’s youth and masterfully orchestra-

songs were lovely to listen to and it was
quite interesting to find more than traces
of Berlioz, Mahler, Debussy and Strauss

Music in the 18th century operated
largely on the principle of planned
obsolescence, though not necessarily to
the enrichment of the manufacturers.
The sheer quantity of concertos, cantatas
and sinfonias ground out by the late
baroque and rococo composers staggers
the imagination; it is almost as astonish-
ing that so much of it is so good—
that composers writing for an audience
that customarily expected to hear a
work only, once before passing on to
some new' thing should so often expend
such wit, invention and even passion
on their craft.
With the revival of interest in baroque
music, this rich repository has become
a source of joy to the recording com-
panies; and 23 concertos and similar
works listed above do not include all
those in recent lists. And no matter how
voracious or prolonged the demand for
baroque concertos may be the supply
will easily last it out.
The aristocrats of the present list are
without dispute the eight concerti grossi
of Handel (selected from the 12 of
Opus 6) recorded by Yehudi Menuhin
and his Bath players. They serve as a
reminder that w'e would be the losers
if in our search for forgotten master-
pieces by Stoelzel, Manfredini and Fux
we overlooked the supremacy of these
works that have never been forgotten.
In the context of the other records
(enjoyable though these are) Handel’s
strength, variety and sureness of touch
shows up all the more strongly.
The performances under Menuhin are
fine, up to a point. They combine tech-
nical precision with warmth and spon-
taneity to a rare degree. But as with
so much modern performance of baroque
music it is frustrating that these excellent
and sincere musicians should go so far
in the direction of scholarly and
authentic performance without going all
the way that having taken such care
to use the right instruments in the right
proportions they should not also study
and observe those details of baroque
practice which would bring the music
fully to life.
To take an example: in the opening
Larghetto-e afjettuoso movement of the
well known Concerto No. 6, the long
minums and semibreves in the solo
string parts, played as they are here
without any expressive ornamentation,
would have sounded anything but
“affettuoso” to Handel’s Italianate ears.
Much the same praise and strictures
can be applied to the other records.
Paillard’s players are, as always, nerv-
ously alive and technically brilliant, and
the recordings (from the French Erato
catalogue) are excellent. Scherchen’s per-
formances are full of gusto, as suits the
plangent brass music he directs, though
the high-flying trumpet parts sometimes
trouble his soloists.
The record with the highest proportion
of pleasant surprises is, for me, the
Pailiard disc entitled “Germanic Baroque
Music”. It includes a prophetically
rococo symphony by C. P. E. Bach
(written in 1733) with an exceedingly
beautiful slow movement, and an un-
expectedly jolly serenade by that formid-
able theoretician J. J. Fux, containing
a fine, roistering, Tom Jonesy jig.

THEATRE
Timidity
Critic’s Choice. Ira Levin. Pocket Play-
house. Sydney.
“It’s very modern, isn't it?” whispered
the lady in the seat behind me to her
friend. This Broadway equivalent of
the West End drawing-room comedy
does have some distinct marks of the
twentieth century about it. The apart-
ment setting, the tape recorder into
which the critic sneers his aphorisms, the
sophisticated mother-in-law, the pre-
cocious child, the dizzy first wife and
the wholesome second wife.
“Critic’s Choice” is that special
Broadway comedy mixture of Bob Hope
and Louisa M. Alcott of sophisti-
cated wisecracks and small-town whole-
someness.
Perhaps, in the interests of local in-
dustry, Australians should be urged to
write their own run-of-the-mill light
comedies. But, in the interests of local
drama, it seems a pity that all the care
and skill displayed in this brisk produc-
tion by Norman McVicker, a very
pleasant setting by Brendan Dunne and
a delightful performance by Dorothy
Duncombe, should not have been
devoted to a better play.
With a competent company and a
very charming theatre it seems unneces-
sarily timid for the “Pocket” to stick so
determinedly to the middlebrow diet
which its list of past productions reveals.

A Bad Time to Die
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Lost Generation. Reginald Pound.
Constable. 465.
“Come and die, it’ll be great fun,”
Rupert Brooke wrote to John Drink-
water in January, 1915. “On service
one has a great feeling of fellowship,
a fine thrill like nothing else in the
world ... Not a bad place to die,
Belgium, 1915?” Three months later
Brooke’s friends were heaping pieces
of marble over his grave in the lonely
valley on Skyros, far from the Flanders
battlefields. His death had not been
“great fun”. He had died from the
combined effects of dysentery, boils,
sunstroke and blood-poisoning. Fate
has a habit of cheating young paladins
of their glory. Byron also set out to
fight the Turks. His dreams of falling
in battle, sword in hand, ended on a
bed of fever at Missolonghi.
Still, Rupert Brooke’s death was no
more grotesquely unheroic than that of
thousands of other eager young Britons
in the first year or so of World War I.
How many other youthful subalterns
dreamt of falling at the head of their
men—only to drown in water-filled shell
craters, or drown more slowly in the
green froth that filled their lungs after
a gas attack? At least Brooke found
a grave in the clean Aegean soil, neigh-
bored by the bones of a Roman woman
and her unguent jars.
In the years between the wars the
name of Rupert Brooke came to evoke
more powerfully than any other the
“lost generation” of which Reginald
Pound writes. Critics might be divided
about the value of his poetry —some
then, as now, found him unbearably tri-
vial and affected —but .to most people he
personified all the budding talents, un-
fulfilled dreams and innocent enthusi-
asms so cruelly harvested by the scythe
of war. Even during the conflict
B'rooke’s name had a peculiar magic.
“Rupert Brooke is dead ... ”, Sir lan
Hamilton wrote in his diary. “Death
grins at my elbow . . . He is fed up with
the old and sick—only the flower of
the flock will serve him now.”
Drawing on letters, diaries and per-
sonal recollections, Pound tells the
stories of many others whom he has
rather arbitrarily culled from “the
flower of the flock”. His subject im-
poses a somewhat disjointed style on the
book, which descends now and then into
a mere catalogue of names, in memor-
iam. But the cumulative effect is som-
brely impressive.
There were other poets beside Rupert
Brooke —20-year-old Charles Hamilton
Sorley, shot through the head at Loos;
Isaac Rosenberg, poet and painter,' and
W. N. Hodgson, both killed on the
Somme. St George’s Day in 1915 was
a particularly black day; within hours
of Brooke’s death on Skyros two of
England’s most brilliant young scholars,
Robert Sterling and Erasmus Darwin
(grandson of Charles), were killed on the
Western Front. Denis Browne, brilliant
pianist, composer and critic for “The
Times” and “New Statesman”, was 27
when he died at Gallipoli.
It was not only cultural lamps that
were extinguished. Tennis lost Tony
Wilding, . 1913 Wimbledon champion
and Norman Brookes’ partner in the
Australasian Davis Cup team. Athletics
lost G. R. (“Twiggy”) Anderson, the
English Olympics hurdler and classical
scholar, of whom it was rapturously
said: “Nature runs riot in her gifts on
some occasions and, in an apparent
desire to produce a very king of men,
gives him beauty and health, grace,
athletic ability and intellect.” For years
after the war, county cricket clubs were
mourning the men who might have won
the Ashes from Australia.
One reason for the fearful drain on
England’s gentlemanpower was the
wastage of regular officers in the early
months of the war. By March, 1915,
only 150 original BEF officers were still
serving in the line. Oxford, Cambridge,
the Territorials and Public School OTCs
were pouring into Flanders a flood of
ardent young volunteers to whom war
was still “a terrific adventure . . . rather
awful, but rather exhilarating”. They
died in droves. In the first year 321
Old Etonians were killed. In 1915
Debrett recorded 800 deaths among
“members of the peerage, baronetage,
knightage and companionage”. Landed
families had been extinguished in the
male line after existing unbroken since
the Wars of the Roses.
Many officers of the New Army had
held their commissions for only a few
weeks when they went to France, and
military tailors scanned the casualty
lists with daily concern for unpaid bills.
Nevertheless the most callow young
subaltern inherited the old British army
tradition. “The men will go anywhere
like lambs as long as they’ve got an
officer with them,” one New Zealand
lieutenant reported with some surprise.
Probably only Britain could have pro-
duced units like the Artists’ Rifles and
the Honorable Artillery Company. Re-
cruits for the latter had to be socially
vetted and pay an entrance fee of two
guineas. “We know your lot,” said one
Cockney Tommy when the HAC re-
lieved his section of the line. “You
paid two quid each to get out here.
You must be bloody well mad!” Another
remarkable band was the Hood Batta-
lion of the Royal Naval Division which
fought at Gallipoli. Its subalterns, fami-
liarly known as the Latin Club, included
Rupert Brooke, Bernard Freyberg, the
diplomat Charles Lister, Patrick Shaw-
Stewart (one of Oxford’s most brilliant
classical scholars), Arthur Asquith and
the rich Australian sportsman F. S.
(“Cleg”) Kelly. Only Freyberg and
Asquith outlived the war.
However, we may justifiably wonder
whether Reginald Pound is not contri-
buting his little bit of nostalgic myth-
making to the 1914 scene. If there had
been no war how many of his slaugh-
tered young writers, artists, scholars and
potential statesmen would have broken
out of the gilded cocoon of post-
Edwardian England? Or, to quote
Pound’s own silly phrase, “would have
resisted the Satanic forces that have
invaded the arts” since World War I?
The loss of all the golden youth cata-
logued by Pound was tragic enough.
We can only speculate on its signifi-
cance.
In the vast army of the dead there
may have been many seminal geniuses—
new Stravinskys, Picassos and Joyces.
We shall never know. But I doubt
whether they would have been found
among the clear-eyed, patriotic young
patricians whose fates are chronicled by
Mr Pound.

A Religious Invasion
Quakers in Russia. Richenda C. Scott.
Michael Joseph. 30s.
Mrs Scott’s study of the Quakers in
Russia opens ominously with an intro-
ductory chapter giving the background
to Quakers, and the background to
Russia. It suggests a certain dogged
thoroughgoingness. But it forebodes
also something like the proverbial
account of Chinese Metaphysics made
by the man who read through the “Ency-
clopaedia Britannica” on Metaphysics,
and on China, and then combined the
two. And often Mrs Scott’s writing has a
comparable lack of literary inspiration.
“They were among the few who saw
the Balkan situation in its true colors . ..
Britain was drifting rapidly on to the
shoals of conflict. Sturge in great
suffering of mind and spirit. . . avert
the catastrophe at this eleventh hour.”
The tired phrases limp on (those were
all on one page) and Mrs Scott’s narra-
tive does not always have the impetus
to carry the reader past them.
Indeed there hardly is a narrative.
What we have is a series of inconse-
quential episodes involving Quakers and
Russians. The stories begin in the
earliest times. There is an anecdote
from George Fox about some Russian
Quakers who were brought before the
Czar as they refused “to put off their
hats nor bow to none but God”. And
as they refused again, the Czar “chopped
off three score of their heads upon one
block and they all died like lambs and
never a one relented”.
Though that story has never been
authenticated, Mrs Scott gives scores
that have. There was the Quaker doctor,
Thomas Dimsdale, who was experi-
menting with smallpox inoculation.
Catherine the Great became interested
and planned to introduce inoculation
to Russia, and decided to undergo the
first inoculation as an example to her
people. Dimsdale agreed to inoculate
her, and set out for Russia. As his life
was forfeit in case of Catherine’s death,
the story goes that a chain of post horses
was kept in readiness to allow him to
escape if necessary. But the inocula-
tion was successful.
Or there was Daniel Wheeler who one
day found the name St Petersburg
flashed into his vision; and some time
afterwards he was summoned to help
the Czar's agricultural reforms. He and
his family and other English Quakers
ran an experimental farm for fifteen
years, which they reclaimed from the
bogs of St Petersburg; some 100,000
acres of wasteland and marsh were
cultivated.
And so the accounts go on, from the
early nineteenth century and through
the Crimean War, as Quakers meet
Russians and Russians meet Quakers.
One interesting fact amongst it all is that
Tolstoy's novel, “Resurrection”, banned
by the Russian censor, was printed in
Britain by a Quaker firm —despite some
Quaker soul-searchings about its moral-
ity.
What is so odd about the book is the
pointlessness of all the activities it
describes. Everything seems very distant
from and irrelevant to the events of the
world around; and also very cranky.
After his Russian episode, Daniel
Wheeler went adventuring in the South
Seas. Stephen Grellet, another of the
Friends, wrote: “Yet sometimes it seems
to me as if I saw a plain path before me
in Norway, Sweden, Russia, towards
the Crimea, over the Black Sea...”
They all certainly seem to have been
admirably self-reliant, brave people, but
in terms of results it is hard to see much.
Continually Mrs Scott tells of Quakers
who obtained audiences with Czars, and
usually the Czar wept or repented or
embraced the Quaker, and carried on
afterwards exactly as before.
And Mrs Scott records it all with
complete impartiality. She gives the
material she has collected, and never
seems tempted to invent or gloss or even
evaluate. This can lead to what seems
an odd disproportion of emphasis—
there is far more concern about the
problem of digging a grave for Wheeler’s
wife, and the fate of the graves under
German shelling of Leningrad in World
War 11, than over the usefulness of the
farming project. Though the impartiality
has obvious virtues it is the sort that
allowed Daniel Wheeler to feed five
officers and 70 troops during the 1825
revolution, without asking which side
they were on—“his only care was to
relieve their distress”.
And the impartiality of Mrs Scott’s
account is very much to be praised in
her account of Quaker activities in
Soviet Russia, when they were involved
in helping war refugees, and in 1921
in famine relief.
Hoover had offered Russia aid on
condition hostilities within the country
should cease —but, as Mrs Scott points
out, there was no suggestion of with-
drawing foreign troops who were help-
ing the White Russians against the Bol-
sheviks. But the Quakers gave aid with-
out strings. The story of their part in
the relief work was worth telling; the
descriptions are moving—decisions had
to be made such as which child of a
large family to feed, which to let die of
hunger. Sickness spread wildly—3oo
people died of typhus in three trains
trapped in snow drifts. This last part of
Mrs Scott’s book is the most interesting.
Here the activities she describes seem
to be useful and purposeful. There is
still the strange erratic collection of
anecdotes, but the reasons for it all are
here, at least, clear.

The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Atomic
Radiation. Margot Bennett, Penguin
Books. ss. 6d.
To be a successful script writer of epi-
sodes for TV’s “Maigret” would seem to
be an unlikely training ground for some-
one who wants to write a book on atomic
radiation and its effects. But Margot
Bennett, in this modestly priced Penguin
Special, has shown that she can turn her
hand effectively to a description and dis-
cussion of this serious subject.
Radiation, to the man (or should I
say woman?) in the street, certainly is
mysterious. It cannot be seen, felt,
heard or smelled and highly sophistica-
ted equipment is needed to detect and
measure it.
Although Rontgen discovered X-radi-
ation 70 years ago it was not until the
last decade or so, with the arguments
about nuclear weapon testing, that peo-
ple began to learn about nuclear radia-
tion at all. And then the situation was
continually confused by claim and
counter-claim. The subject was one of
technical difficulty and it was easy for
the propagandist to supply partial, mis-
leading and, sometimes, downright false
information.
The truth is that man has always lived
with radiation. Penetrating particles
from outer space—the cosmic rays—
plough through our bodies day in and
day out; we eat food which contains
natural radioactive materials and we
live in an environment containing radio-
active substances. These are, in fact, the
sources of what is known as the back-
ground radiation to which everyone is
exposed. Early workers with X-rays
began to suffer burns, lose their hair and
die of cancer and this was the first evi-
dence that radiation, in large enough
doses, could be dangerous. To live
safely with it radiation and its biological
effects had to be understood. Mrs
Bennett’s book is dedicated to pro-
viding such understanding through an
up-to-date review of knowledge written
in simple language and with diagrams to
illustrate certain physical and biological
principles. But it was not X-radiation
which prompted this mother of four
children to learn her physics, biology
and genetics and apply herself to writing
a simple exposition: It was the develop-
ment of fission and fusion opening the
possibility of catastrophic wars in the
future.
She describes how atomic energy can
be used for the good of mankind
through the construction of nuclear
power stations, the uses of radio isotopes
in medicine and agriculture. And she
then goes on to describe the develop-
ment of nuclear bombs, fission and
fusion and, of course, the radioactive
fallout which results from testing such
weapons in the atmosphere. It is an
objective of the book to stay clear of
politics and to quote factual data from
publications of the United Nations
Radiation Committee and the British
Medical Research Council. Perspective
as to the relative importance of the
various forms of environmental radia-
tion mentioned above is obtained from
“the latest figures” for the annual dose
to the gonads in Britain which are
quoted on page 105. In millirads these
are: natural background 95, medical
applications 19, bomb-testing 2.4, mis-
cellaneous sources (e.g., X-ray shoe fit-
ting, luminous watches, etc.) 1.0 (or
less), and from occupational exposure
0.5.
Although it Is claimed on the frontis-
piece that the scientific material was
checked before publication a number of
mistakes have crept in. These range
from the misstatement that the Hiro-
shima bomb was dropped by parachute
to a misleading description of the way
a fast neutron causes ionisation in soft
tissue. But these are minor blemishes, and
do not detract from the real effectiveness
of the presentation of the material.
We may hope that intelligent women
everywhere will read the book. And
when they have finished it there would
be further value to be had by handing
it over to their intelligent husbands.

Two Ways of Considering the
Fog
Only on rare occasions
when the fog which renders
our lives soundless—muffling
footsteps, wadding us up softly
within its cottonwoolly folds
leaving Mum and good old
Dad where would we be
and Jim and Sue and
hello there’s our Auntie Ag all
tucked in comfy-cosy
—only on rare occasions when the fog
lifts without warning
like the curtain in some amateur
theatrical, do we wonder
about the farther view.
Surely, surely, we say,
straining to give meaning
to the middle-distance, there's a tree
a boulder and why yes
a man he’s waving to us, wave
back everybody, wave . . .
Nevertheless
some do not wave, believing
the fog is not our comfort, furthermore
what it conceals, now shambling
forward into our snug history
will prove on closer acquaintance not to
have
our welfare (yours and mine) at heart,
at all.

A Poet’s Correspondence
Ambrosia and Small Beer: The Record of
a Correspondence between Edward
Marsh and Christopher Hassall. Long-
mans. 565. 3d.
For the first half of the twentieth cen-
tury, Sir Edward Marsh occupied a,
central position in the cultural, social
and political scene of London and,
during his twenty-three years as the late
Sir Winston Churchill’s private secre-
tary, he became intimately acquainted
with most of the public figures of his
time and with many members of the
aristocracy. He was a scholar, a patron
of the arts, a Civil Servant, an inveterate
bachelor, a socialite and, on the evi-
dence of his letters, something of a snob.
Marsh was sixty-one and Christopher
Hassall twenty-two when they met in
1937 through a mutual friend (Ivor
Novello) and, within days, the older man
was writing to the young poet, “wooing”
him with praise and criticism of his
work. Their correspondence continued
until Marsh’s death in 1953. The early
letters, with their academic discussions
of poetic technique and the classics (“the
adventures of our souls among master-
pieces”), are by far the most rewarding.
The proportion of anecdotal small-talk
■ —much of which could only interest
personal friends—increases as the friend-
ship develops. Marsh was an un-
doubted authority on English poetry
(particularly the Georgians) and his
scholarly opinions, fragmentary though
they are, give the book its only valid
excuse for publication.
Whether Marsh had any idea that his
letters to Hassall would eventually be
published we cannot know and, in any
case, he can hardly be held responsible;
but, from the reader’s point of view, it
is a pity that he devoted*" so much of
them to name-dropping chit-chat. This
inconsequential, occasionally entertain-
ing, gossip may, in years to come, prove
a valuable supplement to the social his-
tory of his times, but it is tiresome
wading through garrulous accounts of
lunch with Lord This, dinner at Lady
That’s, a first night with Ivor [Novello]
or Noel [Coward], an art show with
Beverley [Nichols] and, when garnished
with such adjectives as ravishing, divine,
delicious, exquisite, gorgeous and ador-
able, “Ambrosia and Small Beer” be-
comes a repast liable to upset the
stomach. Apart from this effeminacy
of style, it must be admitted that, what-
ever his topic, his writing is a lesson in
English expression.
His literary achievements are des-
cribed in a letter of Phyllis Bottome’s:
“You freed a money-strangled voice of
Poetry for your generation—you recrea-
ted the greatest fables of all time [La
Fontaine’s] —you released Florace [his
translations of the Odes] and now you
have written the most satisfying,
thought-provoking memoirs of the cen-
tury”. “Willy” Maugham, in a dedica-
tory letter in his “Strictly Personal”,
wrote: “The future will discover that
many of the best writers of English of
our generation are indebted to you for
such proficiency as they have acquired
in the practice of writing our difficult
language.” Maugham’s testimonial re-
fers not only to his encouragement of
young writers but to his talent for what
Marsh called “diabolisation”, a peculiar
brand of minutely carping criticism
aiming at grammatical perfection and
“correct” choice of words. Most of
Churchill’s writings and speeches were
“diabolised” by Marsh. As the corre-
spondence with Hassall did not begin
until Marsh’s term with Churchill was
over, there are only occasional mentions
of his former boss, the quaintest being:
“He made it [bronchitis] an excuse for
wearing his romper suit all day, and
after dinner put military marches on the
gramophone and danced to them all by
himself”.
This self-appointed custodian of Eng-
lish aesthetic tradition displays an un-
expected taste for frivolity: apart from
his delighted reportage of the scandal of
the day, he peppers his letters with rather
old - fashioned jokes, unconscious
obscenities from literature, and quotes
from “Punch”.
Christopher Hassall, author of three
volumes of poetry, several verse plays
and biographies (including a widely-
acclaimed life of Marsh), died before the
present volume was ready for publica-
tion. He has set Marsh’s letters in a
commentary, giving explanatory notes
where necessary and limiting his own
letters to brief excerpts when required
for full understanding. The bulk of the
book consists of what amounts to a diary
written almost daily and sent to Hassall
during his five years in the Army.
Hassall says that, of the many hundreds
of letters received, only a relatively
small portion have been included and in
these many cuts have been made where
the small-talk became “too small to be
of lasting interest”. Had the editing
been twice as severe, a more readable
book would have resulted. There is far
too much of this type of thing: “Fancy,
a letter two days running! I like your
yellow envelopes, they shine out in the
heap on the dining-room sideboard like
primroses with happy expressions on a
mossy bank.” •
There is a fourteen-page index of all
the “dropped” names. If all those still
living buy a copy, the book should do
well.

Across the Mountains
Two Expeditions into New South Wales.
John Oxley. South Australian Public
Library.
The South Australian Public Library
continues its xerography by an invasion
into the territory of New South Wales
and the publication of a facsimile of
the Journals of John Oxley, Surveyor-
General of two New South Wales
explorations into the interior and then
to the coast at Port Macquarie in 1817
and 1818.
The expeditions followed the exten-
sion of the short traverse across the
Blue Mountains in 1813. Incidentally,
it is notable that in describing it, Oxley,
as Surveyor-General, names Lawson, not
Blaxland, first in the personnel of the
party who made it. a fact which seems
to support my belief that he, not Blax-
land, was the originator and leader of
the enterprise.
Oxley himself was poor stuff as an
explorer. Most of his fame seems to
me to rest on the work of others.
Macquarie had wished to entrust the
work of the 1817-8 expeditions to his
deputy, that bold and intrepid bushman,
G. W. Evans. Lord Bathurst, the
Colonial Secretary, however, thought
that ‘'he does not appear from the style
of his journal to be qualified by educa-
tion for the task”. So Oxley got the job
with Evans second in command, the
real operator, but without the power to
make crucial decisions or do more than
express his opinion.
The value of the expeditions accord-
ingly suffered seriously. Oxley found the
country south of the Lachlan below
Booligal neither safe nor desirable
grazing country, and almost within
sight of the junction of the Lachlan and
the Murrumbidgee, which he failed to
discover, he pronounced the adjacent
country (later part of the great proper-
ties of Tupra and Nap Nap) “for ever
uninhabitable, and useless for all pur-
poses of civilised man”.
His second expedition led him to the
edges of the Macquarie River marshes,
where to the west of Coonamble he
discovered proof that “the interior (of
the continent) was covered with water”,
but his traverse to the coast at Port
Macquarie via the Liverpool Plains was
more fruitful.
Oxley’s Journals in the original are
among the rarest works of Australiana
and the publication of a complete
facsimile at a price within the reach of
students is very valuable to historio-
graphers and teachers. Unlike most
early Australian books about Australia
it has an index.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Protecting the US Boom
President Johnson has been well schooled in psycholo-
gical warfare. Perhaps more than most people
realise, support for the dollar and the strength of the
US economy depends on the conviction of investors and
financial institutions all over the world that the US can
sustain its boom.
Latest psychological weapon in the US armory is Pre-
sident Johnson’s promise that the US can expect uninter-
rupted and vigorous expansion in the year ahead. If already
budgeted Federal plans aren’t enough to maintain the cur-
rent strong pace of expansion, additional fiscal action will
be used, the President promised. He is underwriting the
boom, in other words. No wonder the stock markets surged
forward.
The US Budget, in itself, was a remarkable piece of work
where everybody, apparently, was a winner. There were
tax cuts for the rich (notably a two billion dollars cut in
excise taxes) and more expenditure on health, education
and the unemployed. There is some reduction on defence,
but the Treasury’s policy is to generate increased expansion
(and thereby gain increased tax revenue). The economists
point out that it is ideally possible to do this in the US at
the moment because of the high rate of unemployment,
which permits expansion without the dangers of inflation.
A high percentage of young unemployed is another ar-
gument why the US can budget for continued expansion.
The reason is that these young people, most of whom do
not remain unemployed for more than six months, represent
a constant pool (with more coming on the market con-
tinuously) and do not represent the same sort of unemploy-
ment crisis which would occur if the hard core of family
breadwinners was thrown out of work.
Heartened by a situation where the Government can
spend heavily without competing too seriously for labor,
the US Administration is confident it can solve some of its
external problems this year, notably the chronic balance of
payments deficit.
Also, the US Government can impose a follow-up on
the interest equalisation tax to curb the flow of bank and
institutional loans abroad. Congress already permits the
Administration to impose a tax on foreign bank loans under
a standby authority which was introduced at the same time
as the interest equalisation tax on the purchase of foreign
stocks and bonds.
These indications to the outside world that the US is
determined to block the dollar drain are a warning that the
US will take strong measures if others follow France's move
to convert foreign exchange into gold.
American insistence that there will be no increase in the
price of gold, plus an indication that the US will support
an extension of credit to help bolster sterling, will be im-
portant psychological factors in holding sterling where it is.
It is all a matter of whether the European central
bankers and their Governments accept Uncle Sam’s sales
programme.
Strong Convictions Needed
Traced with a drifting share market and growing agitation
for reduced brokerage, Australian sharebrokers’
circulars tend to adopt the line that “generally favorable
half-yearly company reports will exert a bull influence on
the market.”
The depressive influences, when acknowledged, some-
times are dismissed as merely serving to contain the in-
built growth element in the economy. Presumably this
means that it is just as well to have these depressing factors
to offset what otherwise would be an inflationary spiral.
Several brokers have concentrated their arguments on
base metal stocks, concluding that the world demand should
sustain metal prices at around current levels and thus
ensure a continuance of profits based on negotiated pro-
ducer prices rather than day-to-day fluctuations of London
Metal Exchange prices.
One Melbourne-based broker a month ago had the
courage to come out and say that base metal shares should
be sold. But the word “sell” evidently is a dirty word
because it tends to undermine confidence.
A Sydney broker plaintively remarks that so few stocks
have been showing strength lately that technical news-
letters have not been worthwhile. Nevertheless, he observes
that share price changes have been issuing their own warn-
ings prior to good or bad interim reports, a point which
investors could heed.
Unless there are soundly reasoned arguments in a cir-
cular backed up with recent figures, investors could find
themselves confused. Not all investors are capable of inter-
preting investment recommendations, so it is pertinent
to cite the London Stock Exchange’s recent action in con-
tacting all broking and jobbing houses. It insisted that
circulars must be accurate in all details; that a circular
should state clearly if the conclusions are based on factual
information readily available to the public or on special
material dug up in a specific survey, or an opinion not
supported by factual information.
Investors are prepared to. accept any type of recom-
mendation if they are satisfied they will make money. They
would welcome a positive, well-reasoned, factual argument
that specifically plumps for one share (including a share
from the broking stable) which the broker, after exhaus-
tive research, is convinced is a good buying (or selling)
opportunity. But this means sticking your neck out.

HP for Higher Education
Private finance companies on the campus?
HPaking only the broadest view of the
availability of economic resources
and making no mention of the Federal
Treasurer’s stern recent warnings on the
rising claims of defence, proceedings at
last week’s summer school of the Aus-
tralian Institute of Political Science got
dangerously close to nestling in an aca-
demic vacuum. They were only barely
rescued by a paper on “Resources for
Tertiary Education”, by Dr A. H. Hall
of the Australian National University,
whose thesis was that a needed shift in
the use of resources for this purpose,
requiring a doubling of its present 1 p.c.
share of GNP by 1975, would be “pos-
sible” but not necessarily accomplished
painlessly. The rival claims of defence
were not mentioned specifically, though
elsewhere Hall has shown himself
strongly aware of them. It is a pity that
in failing to highlight them here he
missed the opportunity of putting the
persuasive arguments of other speakers
for a big lift in spending on education
into realistic perspective.
In short, Hall spent most of his paper
discussing ways and means of getting
more funds for higher education,
making only a cursory glance at the
larger and more fundamental problem
of fitting in education’s claims on re-
sources with those of rival uses and
overall availability.
In these circumstances, and because
he took his assumptions on the future
needs of tertiary education largely from
estimates made by Professor Karmel,
Dr Hall didn’t greatly advance under-
standing of the resources problem on
this occasion. Nor did he go very
deeply into the budgetary problems he
saw arising if the attempt was made to
increase expenditure on tertiary educa-
tion to the extent hypothesised.
His analysis of the “real” cost of edu-
cation was brief and to the point. One
aspect was the claim on other people’s
incomes that is necessary to provide in-
comes for educators and for part of the
student population. Another concerned
the claim on building resources. Third,
there is the income forgone because
students, staff and administrators in edu-
cation are not directly adding to the flow
of goods and services in extra-educa-
tional directions. Hall emphasised that
it is the combined effect of these which
makes the educational process a very
costly business.
He also sounded a warning to the
educationalists that at some point in-
creases in expenditure on education
could bring into operation the law of
diminishing returns from the expendi-
ture. For, judged simply in terms of the
best use of resources, there is a limit to
the proportion of resources which should
be devoted to education if the future
output of goods and services of the
economy is to be maximised. In the
first place, the higher proportion of the
population engaged in full-time educa-
tion, he explained, the greater will be the
loss of output which would otherwise
have been produced during the period
education is taking place. Again, given
a normal distribution of ability within
the community, for each given increase
in the proportion of an age group re-
ceiving full-time education in order to
achieve any given level of final attain-
ment, a proportionately larger input of
teaching resources will be required. The
input of educational resources per unit
Dr P. W. E. CURTIN
of output must therefore tend to rise and
beyond a certain point it will probably
rise very sharply.
Dr Hall postulated that for any given

rate of economic growth there would
in principle be an optimum demand for
and a supply of required skills. When
demand falls below the supply of such
skills the returns on educational invest-
ment would fall sharply and unemploy-
ment in the education industry (one
speaker at the school called it the
“knowledge industry”) would become a
significant problem. Because of the long
period required to produce educational
skills, this imbalance could not be
rapidly cured. In fact, he said, as has
often occurred with investment in
machines, investment in academics could
prove to be a very costly business.
It was not suggested that the educa-
tion industry in Australia is yet ap-
proaching such a position. But, clearly, it
could be argued that if defence demands,
say, required heavy cut-backs in spend-
ing on education, it is conceivable that
an over-supply of educators could well
emerge and they would have to take
other and possibly less congenial em-
ployments than at universities.
However, on the assumption that
spending on higher education is going
to expand, as suggested by Hall, by
9 p.c. a year at constant prices in the
context of a 5 p.c. annual growth rate
in GNP (3 p.c. from productivity and
2 p.c. population increase), it is more
likely that demand for educational skills
wtH continue to outstrip the supply. In
fact the main problem Hall sees in
inducing the necessary increase in re-
sources to the service of tertiary educa-
tion is not to do with either physical or
financial resources (given more ingenu-
ity, perhaps on some of the following
lines he suggested) but with the diffi-
culty of getting the necessary supply
of skills.
On the finance aspect, one avenue ex-
plored was the possibility of increasing
the share of university income obtained
from fees, which Hall favored but which
at least Dr P. W. E. Curtin, in the
discussion, apparently did not (Curtin
maintained that the erosion of Common-
wealth scholarships was putting the
universities more and more out of reach
of the masses and more into the laps of
the affluent members of the community).
In 1962 only 8.4 p.c. of university funds
came from students’ fees, compared with
26 p.c. in 1946. Hall thinks that we
should follow' the recommendations of
the Robbins (UK) Committee and in
future meet at least 20 p.c. of current
institutional expenditure from fees.
The direct effect of Hall’s suggestion
would, of course, be to lighten the
Government's share of the growing
burden, whereas Curtin’s would involve
higher Government allocations, to be
met presumably from taxation. It was
surprising how many speakers supported
the implications of Curtin’s view for
taxpayers. One student openly hoped
he would have to pay stiff taxes to
finance education when on completion
of his university course he enters the
work force. Professor Burton said he
had been advocating increased taxation
for education since the war. Nobody
apart from Hall seemed to have any
reservations on the score of the fiscal
burdens involved, of the competing
claims for Government revenue or of
their effect on the pattern of resources
used in a full employment economy
straining to opt more resources for de-
fence.
Then Dr Hall had a hard look at the
notion of students financing their higher
education on hire-purchase. In effect this
would mean a student mortgaging some
of his prospective income to be earned on
entering the work force. (One woman
advocating the cause of “the mature
woman” for adult education hand-outs
considered we were already taking too
much of a chance on immature teen-
agers!) No doubt there would be a
high demand for hire-purchase from the
student force, but the real question is
whether private finance companies would
enter the campus. It's hard to think of
any off-hand, though it's an idea Dr
Curtin might put to his masters at the
Reserve Bank.
Hall is certainly right in saying that
the provision of hire-purchase finance
facilities for students would increase the
demand for higher education and is on
safe ground in saying that they would
tap previously unavailable financial re-
sources for education. The use of hire-
purchase would also mean that the costs
of education financed by this method
would be borne by those who benefited
by it.
Perhaps less intriguing than his hire-
purchase kite, Hall also canvassed the
idea of educational bodies floating loans
on the capital market. He seemed to
think these would be a doubtful quantity
and would certainly have to be issued at
high rates of interest and possibly subsi-
dised by the Government. Maybe, but it
would be a sound test of public interest
in higher education to experiment with
one to see how it went (even if it failed
to find an underwriter).
Some of the off-the-cuff speakers at
the summer school suggested interest
in higher education was mainly persona-
lised and that general public interest in
it was at very low level. I his was also
the view of others about interest in adult
education, on which Professor Wilson
said we were only spending about Is. 3d.
per head of the population or a total of
£700,000 a year, compared with £124
million on all forms of education (of
which tertiary education takes £7O-
- million).


The World of Cleaver Bunton
Albury looks to a vision splendid
By J. C. HORSFALL
years in a row is a long
span to be mayor of an Australian
city. So when calling at the Albury Town
Hall to see Cleaver Bunton, who has held
the office there for that long, it is a little
surprising to see such a robust and
sprightly figure. Football runs in the
family. Cleaver himself, now on the
wrong side of sixty, has been a leading
player and official in the local Australian
Rules arena (the Murray and Ovens Val-
ley League) for more than a generation.
He is obviously still very much on his
toes, as you soon see at his office, which
is virtually wide open to the throbbing
traffic of Dean Street, the city's main
business thoroughfare, making him
easily the most accessible mayor one has
met. He sits, not unlike Mussolini used
to (and with certain facial resemblances
to II Duce), in a high chair at the broad-
est of desks at the far end of a long
room which seems semi-dark as you
come in from the street, giving him
ample time to sum you up. You find
him with hands palmed and elbows on
desk, eyeing you keenly in the process of
walking up until the telephone inter-
rupts and you are waved to a row of
chairs along the window wall to await
your audience and think of the many
burghers who have gone before you.
Telephone finished, he quickly puts
you at ease and is suggesting a cup of
tea, bobbing into the dry mayoral cup-
board to put the kettle on and serving it
with biscuits by his own hand. You
wonder on the ways of mayors, whether
the cupboard is totally dry and if this
is the answer to his mayoral longevity.
Bunton is pretty well a full-time
mayor these days. He retired from an
accountancy practice some years ago to
keep more of his fingers in the municipal
ar *d occupy himself more fully with
radio and television appearances, a
somewhat unusual diversion for such a
high local dignitary but one which he
sa Y s comes easily to him and he gets a
kick out of. Under a jacaranda tree now
fuh bloom beside his lofted home on
Memorial Hill he is clearly monarch of
all he surveys.
He quickly dispels any idea that
Albury was just a stopping place on the
main trunk routes linking Melbourne
and Sydney; somewhere people used to
alight unshaved at some unearthly morn-
ing hour to snatch “The Age” from a
very limited kiosk and drag themselves
aboard the Spirit of Progress for the last
long stretch of the train trip to Mel-
bourne; somewhere private motorists
hoped against hope that the endless
stream of interstate trucksters plaguing
them along the Hume Highway might
miraculously come to rest.
Taking a mere side glance at Wagga
and Holbrook, the Mayor warms to his
wealth of numbers and resources, to his
hegemony of Albury in the Riverina
hierarchy. The figures are at his finger-
tips and, if for most other purposes
sister border town Wodonga and the fer-
tile agricultural and pastoral Kiewa,
Mitta Mitta and Ovens valleys are in a
foreign land, their wealth and numbers
are eventually thrown in to swell the
totals.
So within a ten-mile radius of his
town hall, Bunton can smile on more
than 50,000 faces and, going out 100
miles all round, no less than 300,000.
Better still, within an arc swinging from
just north of Sydney to the south-eastern
corner of South Australia resides two-
thirds of Australia’s total population,
with Albury strategically located plumb
at the hub from which reach out five
main highways and integrated railway
routes to serve the whole area more
expeditiously than any other industrial
centre, State capitals included. As for
the city of Albury itself, outside Can-
berra it is the fastest-growing city in the
Commonwealth. Nearing 25,000 now, its
numbers have increased by 50 p.c. in the
l as t ten Y ears and by 6000 since 1961.
Recounting the wealth of rural re-
sources of the area using Albury as its
main trading centre, Mayor Bunton runs
out °f superlatives. The region boasts,
for instance, 10 million sheep (the Al-
bury saleyards handle about 350,000 a
year), 750,000 beef cattle (the main auc-
tion for these is at Wodonga, which sells
roughly 1000 a week), 50,000 pigs and
fowls are available each year for pro-
cessing, nearly five million bushels of
wheat and 14 million bushels of oats,
600,000 bushels of barley, 10,000 bushels
of rye and 8000 cwt of tobacco. An im-
pressive list.
For a moment Bunton gives the im


pression of being quite content to be
squire of such a magnificent domain,
willing to go on building around it all
the amenities of pleasant, cultured living
at the manor house, keeping the en-
croaching factory world at some re-
move. I was to hear more about that at
a later interview. He had work to do
and invited me to get acquainted with
the city’s industrial and commercial set-
up.
TI/Iy eyes on these fronts were opened
wide by the Albury Regional Promo-
tion Council, whose chairman, Mr J. D.
Phillips, and executive officer, Mr Les
McDonald, took me in hand for a couple
of days. This was the first time I’ve struck
a provincial promotional body which
was really getting down to business. Not
only does it have its own full-time
executive officer (appointed last May),
but as well pays a considerable fee to
one of the top PR firms in “Sydney to
work for it further afield. Clearly it
thinks the NSW Government's Depart-
ment of Decentralisation and its regional
officers are not doing enough; that Al-
bury, some 360 miles from Sydney, is
rather too remote from the State capital
to get the attention it deserves; that it
can get only so far with the Victorian
Government in obtaining decentralisa-
tion concessions, since it is “over the
border”.
The view was put to me that Albury
was in a sort of no-man’s-land, a Cinde-
rella in the industrial Commonwealth, no
State's baby. Too far away for Sydney
to bother abouLand divorced from much
help from Victoria by the existence of
the State boundary, it was said. Some
residents would like to join up with
Victoria and liked the proposal to hive
off the Riverina from NSW. However,
the city’s authorities have stopped think-
ing wishfully and have made a short cut.
They are promoting with their own
strong arm.
Yet, let us be quite frank about it, for
all its diversity, factory industry is still
in its infancy in the Albury area. The
most pervasive of it is in engineering and
assembling of farm machinery. Most of
the engineering shops are very small and
as a rule employ only a few hands. The
biggest, D. J. Delarue, which was re-
cently taken over by Viscount Holdings
(of which J. D. Phillips is chairman), em-
ploys less than 100 and, in a mixed
assembly and manufacturing operation,
turns out a variety of machinery, bulk
handling equipment and motor compo-
nents as well as doing a certain amount
of general processing. Its turnover has
been expanding at something up to 25
p.c. a year in the last three years and is
obviously destined to expand very much
more now it has linked with Viscount,
which, as a public company, has more
ready access to the necessary capital.
This could be Albury’s best hope for ex-
pansion in engineering.
The biggest drag on expansion in metal
working is the disproportionately high
cost of steel in Albury compared with
that in the metropolitan capitals. To
overcome this, Albury is trying to get a
steel franchise to put it on all fours with
the price to city firms of £4B a ton,
which is based on special freight rates
for direct railment of steel to the State
capitals. A franchise for direct railment
of steel to Albury may be difficult to
get, as other country centres would ob-
viously demand similar facilities. How-
ever, the local industry is pressing hard
for it. Local steel users also complain
that they miss out on the allocation of
odd lots of steel by city merchants, es-
pecially onerous, this, in the present
short supply position, simply because
CLEAVER BUNTON
they are not on the spot when such lots
become available.
Also militating against more vigorous
expansion in metal-working and engin-
eering industry is the shortage of sub-
contractors, at least those able to handle
sub-orders on any scale (there are two
small foundries in Albury and a bigger
one at Wodonga which has more work
than it can cope with from engineering
firms in the area). Metal-working firms
in the capital cities have only to reach
for the telephone to a local supplier to
get accommodated on most components
they need. As often as not such supplies
are not likely to be available in Albury.
This disadvantage is being overcome
even if slowly, but in the interim some
of the city’s engineering concerns have
had to turn down orders and so forgo
expansion on the basis of them.
Even so, I visited one small firm, Mon-
arch Products (about a dozen employ-
ees), making electric welders, which is
shortly to double its labor force and add
two new products, hacksaws and wire
benders. The owner told me his product
was fully competitive with the major
Australian suppliers and even in the
Japanese market. He said the market for
his product was wide open and he had
arranged Australia-wide franchises. Most
of his employees come straight from
local schools and are trained on the spot.
The working conditions in this and all
the other industrial establishments I visi-
ted were obviously very good indeed.
This helps to explain the entire absence
of industrial disputes. Apparently union
officials only rarely visit Albury. This is
a feature of industry there which should
greatly appeal to many city firms
plagued with industrial trouble. The
wonder is that more of them are not
attracted to the region.
The attractions were at any rate obvi-
ous enough to the big German firm
Gebr. Claas, which has established an
Australian subsidiary, Alfarm, at North
Albury to assemble and distribute agri-
cultural machinery, including the biggest
threshers I’ve seen to date. The Austra-
lian manager explained that all the com-
ponents were imported and sent by road
from Melbourne. The location is ideal
for distributing and servicing farm
machinery. This is one industry for
which Albury would seem to have
special advantages in several directions,
not least, according to the manager,
being the ease and speed at which every-
body at the plant can get to and from
work. This plant could well be expanded
in the near future after the recent visit
by the parent company’s managing
director and it could lead to other Euro-
pean firms being sold on the area’s in-
dustrial attractions.
So while engineering has no natural
advantages, such as a local supply of
raw materials, at Albury, it is making
quite good progress. Though, as might
be expected, most of Albury’s secondary
industry rests on the processing of local-
ly-grown raw material and products,
mainly agricultural. The main exceptions
are a handful of small textile establish-
ments, including an offshoot of Mac-
quarie Worsteds Ltd. It is surprising that
some of the bigger textile groups have
not come to the district, where there is
an ample supply of female labor which
would jump at the opportunity of such
employment. I understand at least one
other Sydney firm has shown some in-
terest in setting up a regional factory in
the area.
JFhe range of processing industries is
much as expected and quite extensive,
including bricks, concrete, dairy fac-
tories, fibrous plaster, aerated waters,
woodworking and flour milling. All the
establishments are fairly small, with the
exception of the one- flour and feeding
stuffs mill. This is owned by Bunge
(Australia) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the

huge South American group Bunge and
Born. It employs upwards of 100.
Albury would certainly get a shot in
its industrial arm if this group decided
to establish some other wide-ranging ac-
tivities in the city, but the managing
director failed to bite on that one when
I put it to him. Having secured a good
hold on bakeries in the Riverina (not
without local heart-burnings), activity
was pretty brisk at the mill when 1 was
there.
Calling next on local stockbroker Mr
Wilson-White, who with his partner, Mr
Kelso, runs an agency of lan Potter and
Co. in the city (J. B. Were and Son also
has an agent in the city), gave an inti-
mate picture of the ample capital avail-
able for investment in the area and also
of the limited extent to which this capi-
tal has yet been tapped for Albury’s own
advantage. Wilson-White told me that
far too much of it is left idle in local
stockings such as bank deposits and soli-
citors’ trust accounts. On the other hand,
the banks are generous in their accom-
modation to the private companies and
partnerships which rule most of the
enterprises in the area; and the two
listed public companies, Viscount Hold-
ings (formed in 1960) and Albury TV (of
more recent origin), with headquarters
in Albury have had excellent support
from local capital.
Finance-wise the city is oriented more
towards Melbourne than Sydney. No
Sydney stockbrokers have agents there.
It is much too early to be thinking of
establishing a stock exchange. The in-
vestment flow to the Melbourne ex-
change is steady if not spectacular, pro-
bably not more than a dozen or so
transactions a day passing through the
hands of the two agents’ firms.
Wilson-White, who, by the way, is a
retired local chemist, thought that farm
machinery, engineering, textiles and
automotive industries were possibly the
most suitable for industrial expansion in
the area. As chairman of the local
tourist authority he was even more im-
pressed with the possibilities in that
direction. Speaking against the back-
ground of the glowing tourist attractions
of the city and surrounding countryside,
he said this industry had made enormous
strides in recent years. Armed with eight
motels and sixteen hotels, accommoda-
tion in Albury has long had a high repu-
tation. It boasts about 1200 beds.
Several new motels are going up and
some of the old hotels, like the vener-
able Sodoms, are being refurbished.
Oo the city is in a strong position to en-
tice more and more of the average
of 2000 or so cars of non-locals coming
through the fruit-fly barrier daily to stay
overnight and for longer periods. Ap-
parently 262,000 visitors stayed more
than one night last year, a rise of 64,000
in five years. One of the biggest motels,
the Viscount, had an occupancy rate of
more than 90 p.c. last year. Others are
also said to be pretty well full for most
of the time.
With this conspectus under my belt
we rejoined the Mayor at the town hall
and soon got into an engrossing discus-
sion on how best to attract industry to
the area and in what directions. I re-
frained from mentioning that one of the
new proprietors to come to the area had
told me he considered the municipality
had done next to nothing to help his firm
in coming, on arrival or since. But a
new spirit of co-operation has swept
over the city in recent months and the
talk was not only of offering package
deals buttressed with concessions on
freights and the like from State authori-
ties but also of tackling the establish-
ment of new industry in a pioneering
spirit.
Referring to the promise country
towns and cities in NSW have given to
receive evacuees from Sydney in the
event of war, Mr Bunton saw no reason
why a start shouldn’t be made now as
part of a national programme to re-
distribute the population. This is an idea
the Civil Defence authorities should con-
sider seriously, though Bunton was not
very hopeful that they would. In the
meantime he was confident that if people
in the capitals could only sample how
good and “liveable” a place Albury was
they would come to live there like a
shot.
With more tea coming from the cup-
board, the Mayor was at his eloquent
best talking about the thickening of
social and cultural sophistication of this
border city. Perhaps it was still a little
provincially opaque as yet, but, pointing
to a sketch of the emerging Civic Square
on the wall, he was soon elaborating on
the Council's own contribution to the
vision splendid. The apple of his eye was
the new. Civic Theatre, opened by Mr
Renshaw in one of his first engagements
as NSW Premier in May last year (Al-
bury has long had a Liberal member in
the State Parliament, though locals are
now saying that a promising Labor
candidate could well turn the tables next
time round).
The go-getting industrialists in the
city, like Jim Phillips, pose some-
thing of a dilemma for Bunton. While
not denying them their head, he is
anxious that industrial expansion will not
take Albury out of the pastoral age into
a sordid nightmare of modern" metro-
politan industrialism and garish subur-
ban sprawl. There is already a noticeable
intrusion. Though industry is zoned in
Albury to keep it out of sight of the
cultural and social pastures, new dwell-
ings and shops are winding snakelike in
ugly succession ever further out along
the Hume Highway.
modern industrial age is certainly
catching up with Albury just as the
transport revolution already has and not
always to the full satisfaction or con-
venience of the industrialists. Mr Phil-
lips, who came to the place for Perme-
wan Wright many years ago after serv-
ing with the company from boyhood in
Melbourne and later ’back of Bourke,
told me over an unnecessarily large
steak at the Viscount Motel that the
the leisurely business trip by
train to Melbourne have gone. No
longer can you leave for Melbourne at
a respectable hour by the Spirit of Pro-
gress and after a full breakfast and a
quiet morning’s viewing of pleasant Vic-
torian countryside glide into Spencer
Street towards midday. You now have to
get up at five in the morning and on a
constricted seat rock it all the way to
Melbourne on the standard gauge to the
tune of an indifferent breakfast and your
coffee spilling all over the place. If you
elect to go by air, there is no trouble in
the morning, but in the afternoon there
is, at least in winter when ’planes can’t
land at the airport after dark, though
plans are laid to have this changed.
Whether Bunton is quite on their
wave or not, the likes of Jim Phillips,
who is chairman and managing- director
of two listed companies, are going to
win the industrialists’ day for Albury.
Bunton and they, who are not blind to
the attractions of cultural and social
sophistication, can only hope the
graceful living will still go on when
more and bigger factories go up.

Rejuvenating Small Grocers
Counter-attack on the chains
The revamping of the grocery busi-
ness, brought about mainly by
Woolworths’ and Coles’ introduc-
tion of the American-style supermarket,
is finally paying off for the small, inde-
pendent grocer. Three or four years ago
these small grocers were very worried
about the effect the chains’ bulk buying
powers might have on their businesses.
At first it hurt. Now, today, with
the grocery groups like Allfoods, Unity
and Four Square (in NSW), to name but
a few, the corner grocer is on a level
footing with his giant competitors
throughout Australia. Independent
grocers have achieved something similar
to the chains’ purchasing power by band-
ing themselves into flexible groups,
which are able to buy at virtually the
same price as the Woolworths and the
Coles, and their affiliated chains.
For some small grocers it has been a
hard road to hoe, especially for those
in close proximity to supermarkets.
Many of them countered that particular
influence by converting their stores to
self-service. By so doing they had a
distinct advantage over their big com-
petitors—if they could buy at the same
price. For a start, overheads remained
the same (there was no need to take on
extra staff) and, if the business was pro-
perly run and promoted, turnovers in-
creased.
Perhaps the independents’ biggest
drawcard was that they could still retain
the individual, personalised attention the
housewife likes when she shops. Super-
markets run on a grand scale have not
been able to give quite the same kind of
attention. They have not necessarily
suffered because of this. Yet the busi-
ness the independent grocers did not
keep is now returning, because they can
compete in price and still give individual
attention.
Today most small grocers operate on
a self-service system. Those that are not
purely self-service combine behind-the-
counter with help-yourself. An ironic
choice of words, for it seems that shop-
lifters are helping themselves to up to
2 p.c. of the industry’s turnover. Cal-
culated on 1963-64 Australian total
grocery sales of £465 million, shoplifters
served themselves to the tune of £9.6
million.
Two p.c. is only an approximation.
Several companies The Bulletin spoke
to agreed that it was not an unduly high
estimate.
Shoplifting is one problem. Under-
cost selling is another. The writer was
shown full-page advertisements in subur-
ban papers featuring dozens of lines at
undercost prices. Naturally the cus-
tomer might never really know whether
goods were being sold under or over
cost. But they’re not hard to pick.
Generally speaking, anything on which
a limit has been placed (limit of two
packets, limit of two bottles, etc.) is
under cost.
Most grocers, so The Bulletin dis-
covered, would like to see the last of
undercost selling. Later in this article
one leading grocer suggests a way it
could be done.
Another major problem the industry
will face shortly is decimal currency.
When D-day comes 12 months from
now, small grocers will share the pro-
blems that any other industry using cash
registers and accounting machines will
experience. Staff will have to be trained,
machines converted, price tickets writ-
ten in both £.s.d. and dollars and cents.
But the biggest problem is the half-
penny. It will disappear from our coin-
age when we get decimal currency and
the favorite weapon of the grocer’s re-
tail psychology will be lost to him. The
question of what will happen to the half-
penny is also discussed later on.
A spokesman for A. G. Campbell
Holdings Ltd, one of Sydney’s largest
wholesale grocers, said the independent
grocer had been put back on his feet
by the wholesalers’ and manufacturers’
interest in the proper merchandising of
the line he carries. This, coupled with his
ability to buy, through buying groups, at
virtually the same price as the super-
market chains has put the independent
grocer in a very sound position. We have
set up a group called Allfoods Grocery
Centre and supply 350 stores in Sydney
and the near country areas.
“Grocers who deal with us do not
have to buy all their groceries from us,
so it is a fairly flexible arrangement. We
supply them with promotional material,
dodgers and so on, and help them with
their merchandising displays. We have
eight bulk stores in the Sydney metro-
politan area. They are all self-service,
which means we can offer lines to
grocers at competitive prices.
“When supermarkets came to Aus-
tralia there was a period when the small
grocer suffered from very strong com-
petition. Now he is in a pretty good
position with his merchandising aids.
The small grocer today is keeping a
steady grip on his side of the trade. In
America he has even been gaining, so I
understand. This is because the super-
markets in America lack personal ser-
vice. They’re not really interested in
the customers, only what they spend.
The independent grocer looks after his
customers and gives them individual
attention. It’s paying off for him, both

in America and here. And here, of
course, we have an expanding popula-
tion which is giving him more business
every day.”
Mr L. C. Wood, managing director
.of Derrin Brothers Ltd which operates
72 retail grocery stores in the Sydney
metropolitan area, said grocery retail-
ing was “one of the most fiercely com-
petitive industries that I know. Com-
petition has developed over the past
three or four years, since Woolworths
and Coles first started to come into the
industry. This competition generally has
affected our earnings, but things are
starting to get back to normal. Business
has now reached the stage where the
independent grocer is on a par with his
bigger supermarket competitors. If he
is running only one or two shops, he is
more flexible than the chain can be.
He can meet competition in his own
area and quickly counter price cuts. He
has to meet it in only one spot—we
have to meet it in 72.
“Manufacturers are coming to the
party more and more with additional
discounts for volume buying, helping
both the chains and the independents.
“The big problem we all have to face
is decimal currency, which is going to
be a real headache for the trade. There's
going to be trouble with halfpennies.
There’s a lot of planning already being
done to take care of decimal currency
when it does come, but the grocery in-
dustry will not get together to fix prices.
We are trying to meet the problem
already by cutting out halfpennies on
prices wherever we can.
“However, there is no firm policy
throughout the trade on whether prices
including a halfpenny will go up or
come down. I think generally where a
line costs us, say, Is. 1 1 id. we'll call it
Is. lid. Where it costs us Is. llfd.
we’ll call it 2s. What’s going to happen
if it costs us Is. 11 Id? 1 don’t know.
It’s a strange thing, the halfpenny. If
you sell an article for Is. 1 fid. you'll
probably do twice the volume you'd do
if it was priced at 25.”
A spokesman for another chain ot
retail grocers said he would like to see
the end of undercost selling. “Unfor-
tunately, while it exists we must sell
some lines under cost, otherwise we
would not be in business. I think the
Government should take a firm stand to
ensure that goods are not sold below
their cost. Perhaps they could do what
the South Australian Government has
done and eliminate limits.
“By making it illegal to put a limit
on the number of cans or bottles of a
product that can be bought, no retailer
is going to sell under cost. If he did,
he’d be leaving himself wide open to big
purchases of one line. He obviously
couldn't afford to sell, say, a bottle of
tomato sauce at 6d. under cost because
people, even his competitors, would buy
from him in bulk and he’d stand to lose.
“We are hoping in the trade that there
will be some Government action soon to
eliminate undercost selling. If it can
be done away with, prices will stabilise
and there will be greater savings for the
customer, as prices will inevitably come
down.”
Another retailer said shoplifting was
a major worry in the grocery trade. “As
far as we can judge, shoplifters are
getting away with about 2 p.c. of our
turnover, and that’s not chicken feed.
You read of prosecutions in the paper
every day, but it doesn’t discourage
them. And the cases that get to court
represent only a hundredth part of the
goods that are stolen.
“Very little of the shoplifting is on
impulse. Shoplifters, mainly women,
plan their stealings. We had one woman
in one of our stores who announced she
was pregnant. A few months later she
came into the store really looking as if
she was. Actually she had a kitchen
colander under her clothes and when
she was arrested she’d filled it with
expensive cosmetic lines. Shoplifting is
premeditated, I think.”
A supermarket operator told The
Bulletin he believed the small grocer
was “never better off than he is now.
For two reasons: one, he has lower
overheads than the chains and two,
costs have never been better because of
Woolworths’ and Coles’ entry into the
grocery field. The little bloke is not
taken for a ride now as he was in the
past.
“The problem with the industry three
or four years ago was that the corner
grocer had no idea of costs, labor, over-
heads, and so on. Frequently he entered
the business when he was 14 and, with-
out the proper education just did not
know the economies of the trade. That's
all changed now and the business is
being run on much better lines.
“Frozen foods have given the industry
great impetus. In America frozen foods
claim 50 p.c. of the trade. Here it is
only 10 p.c. or 12 p.c., but it is catch-
ing up.”

Brickbats from Coventry
Votes on Stanhill Development Finance
VTow that the noteholders in Stanhill
•*"’ Development Finance have voted
against the directors’ reconstruction, the
company's chances of winning Supreme
Court approval for the scheme and of
defeating the Attorney-General’s wind-
up petition have come very close to
being completely obliterated. The man
behind the noteholder’s anti-vote was
Mr K. D. J. Coventry, who threw
several hard brickbats at the scheme a
few weeks ago in an effort to squash the
company once and for all (see The
Bulletin, Jan. 23, p. 50).
The company's receiver, Mr R. F.
Hughes, also opposed reconstruction on
the grounds that the proposed amend-
ments would take away a number of
safeguards incorporated in the original
scheme and create a “whole new host of
objections”. Despite this guidance from
the only expert sources outside the
board, unsecured creditors voted for the
scheme, while ordinary shareholders
postponed a full decision until February
18, by which time all those absent would
have knowledge of the amendments. Mr
Coventry said they should avoid any
decision until Court sanction was given.
With the Attorney-General, Mr
Coventry, Mr Hughes and now the note-
holders all fighting for liquidation, sanc-
tion will indeed be a hard thing to win.
Without it the battle will, of course,
be lost. One of the amendments in-
'Volved a cheque for £125,000 which
would be available as soon as Court
sanction was won. Mr C. Calderwood,
Court-appointed chairman of the meet-
ings, said this was not a bait but an
irrevocable undertaking between the
lenders and the bank. Although no one
saw the cheque, it was supposedly held
by someone present in the room at the
meeting.
Last week the hearing of the Attor-
ney-General’s petition to wind up SDF
was adjourned for a week. Mr R. L.
Gilbert, for the Attorney-General, op-
posed the adjournment, saying that he
could settle the whole business in just
20 minutes. In claiming that the. appli-
cation was part of a long drawn-out and
blatantly continued policy of delay, he
voiced for the first time an opinion
which has long been held by many
observers. He pointed out that the
group was hopelessly insolvent, with
liabilities of £2 million and assets of
only £200,000.
Dt eary Drugs
HThe permanent nature of the setback
suffered by Drug Houses of Austra-
lia last year has evidenced itself in the
recent interim report. The half-yearly
dividend has been reduced from 5 p.c.
to 43 p.c., despite increased sales in the
six months and~~a profit which was
described as “comparable” with that
earned in the same period of 1963-64.
Last year’s total dividend of 113 p.c.
was only covered sparsely by the earn-
ings of 12.8 p.c. It is likely that the
indicated payout of 9 p.c. or 10 p.c. for
the current year will see an even nar-
rower cover. Although the half-year’s
profit was “comparable”, there are some
doubts as to whether the full year's will
be.

interim report that reduced gross profit
margins and increased operating costs
had persisted during the December six
months. Second, last year’s tax provi-
sion saw substantial benefits from in-
vestment allowances, export promotion
and losses on fixed asset sales. To what
extent these will apply in the current
year is unknown.
Even if similar benefits apply again,
they cannot go on indefinitely. The toll
on profits must eventually be well
marked unless sales can be pushed
higher and costs controlled in the mean-
time.
Car Troubles
another motor vehicle distributor
-*• has reported lower profit due to
“keen competition”. This time it is
W. T. Coggins Holdings Ltd, Sydney Hol-
den car and Bedford truck distributor,
whose directors say profit for the
December half-year has fallen 40 p.c.
when compared with the previous cor-
responding period.
They say that “while turnover of the
half-year was slightly higher than the
corresponding period of the previous
year, due to keen competition it has not
been possible to maintain profit margins.
This decline is consistent with the chair-
man's forecast at the last annual general
meeting. We point out, however, that
these comparisons are made with what
was a near-record year”.
Where is this “keen competition”
coming from? Japan is making inroads
on the market, mainly in the under-
£looo bracket. Distributors most
severely affected seem to deal in the
over-£lOOO field. The Bulletin rang
several distributors and their general
comment was that the competition was
undeniably there, yet it was hard to trace
exactly where it was coming from. “It's
Holden against Holden,” one dealer said.
Another pointed out that Japanese
makes had captured almost 10 p.c. of
the new car market, almost as much as
Chrysler's Valiant. “Generally speak-
ing turnovers have not suffered, but
margins have,” he added.
Coggins' directors add that results for
the full year will be “satisfactory under
present competitive conditions’’. A
cautious market has left the company’s
ss. shares at 245. 3d., where they yield
5.2 p.c.

lie lists. Profit came out at only 4.3 p.c.
on capital. It was £24,000 after the
appropriate charges, including a write-
off of almost £13,000 for bad and
doubtful debts.
This news provides an extremely bit-
ter pill for the shareholders. Dividends
of 10 p.c. were predicted for the year
back in August, 1963. At the same
time a one-for-one issue was made, a
move considered dangerous and now
proven to be so.
Directors issued a “don’t sell” warn-
ing prior to the issue but now share-
holders must wonder if it would have
been better to ignore this advice. A
similar feeling pervades a warning of
the same nature which was is-sued at
balance date last year. At the time,
the board made the announcement be-
cause of “negotiations pending”.
At the time of going to press, more
than two months have passed and no
further news has come to hand. But
with the profit announcement last week
came a statement referring to the board’s
“optimism that an advantageous arrange-
ment with an organisation of strength
can be made in the near future”.
Such a statement of course means
nothing. It does serve to strengthen a
belief that, without takeover, Ready
Credit is destined for hard choices.
Out of the Groove
(Australia) Ltd, gramophone
record maker and maker of the
HMV range of electronic equipment, is
increasing its interim dividend from 6£
p.c. to 7 p.c., because of “a most satis-
factory” increase in profit in the half-
year to December 31.
If the dividend pattern is continued,
total payment for the year will be 15
p.c. The company has followed the
interim with a final 8 p.c. (which in-
cludes all p.c. bonus) for the last three
years. Directors say the profit increase
follows a 17 p.c. turnover increase,
though they also point out that the
company is usually more profitable in
the July-December half than in the
January-June period.

moment for around 255., where the
yield is 3 p.c.

Victorian-based Thomas Nationwide
Transport has acquired the Power group
of Wagga, thus establishing another link
in its chain of distributing centres. TNT’s
profit in the December six months
jumped from £131,000 to £179,000,
boosting earning rates on an annual basis
from 23 p.c. to 24.6 p.c. on capital
increased by a par issue a few months
ago.
Last year’s full profit was £240,000,
equalling 20.7 p.c. bn average capital.
The result broke all previous records.
Such will be the case in the current year
as well. The six months’ effort came after
a sales lift from £3.8 million to £4.5
million, a 77 p.c. lift in the depreciation
vote and a 36 p.c. lift in the tax pro-
vision. Interim dividend will be a steady
5 p.c., indicating another 10 p.c. for the
full year.
Berleis Change
T>erlei United Ltd, foundation gar-
'll ment maker, is keeping share-
holders happy by giving a 50 p.c. in-
crease in dividend. Payment has been
taken to 15 p.c. after 28 years on a 10
p.c. basis.
The increase follows record sales and
profits for the December half-year, say
directors. They expect the trading and
profit for the current year to be good.
While an actual 15 p.c. dividend has
not been established, the interim pay-
ment of 71 p.c. would indicate the
higher yearly rate. Although 10 p.c.
has been held since 1936, shareholders
have received two bonus issues and four
cash issues since 1947.
Directors say the increase in sales and
profits applied to both the English and
Australian companies. Combined results
showed a record for the group. Last full
year’s profit of £261,723 almost equalled
1960’s record £267,535. The company’s
10s. shares rose 3d. to 235. 9d. on the
interim announcement. Yield on the
expected higher dividend is 6.3 p.c.
Expected Issue
Tn its first issue to shareholders since
1955-56, Melbourne - based Ralph
McKay intends financing expansion plans
with a one-for-five distribution of ss.
shares at a ss. premium. Despite this
100 p.c. loading, there will still be plenty
left in the way of capital gains, as each
unit was fetching more than 20s. on the
market before the announcement was
made last week.
As a successful manufacturer of agri-
cultural and automotive components, the
company will use the cash to extend
buildings and make additions to plants
in both Adelaide and Melbourne and to
“finance the continuing growth of the
companies in the group”. This is good
news for the shareholders as, although a
premium issue was predicted, there was
nevertheless a good chance that expan-
sionary money would come from existing
sources or from a loan capital raising as
in 1961.
There will be no problem in main-
taining the well-established 12i p.c. divi-
dend on the higher capital. According to
the interim report released with the issue
announcement profits are rising. Last
year they equalled a booming 30.7 p.c.
on ordinary capital. In fact, the extra 2
p.c. tacked on to the normal payout last

Unfaltering FCA
Tn 1964-65, bank-backed Finance Cor-

it has scored every year since listing in
1959. Last week's interim report showed
a profit of £241,000 for the December
six months, compared with £222,000 in
the previous corresponding period. Full
profit in 1963-64 was £441,000.
Calculated on an annual basis, the
interim result was equal to 17.2 p.c.
on capital, down from 17.5 p.c. last
year, thanks to a slight capital increase
over the period. Interim dividend will be
a steady 5 p.c., indicating that the usual
10 p.c. full payout will grace share-
holders’ pockets, once again. This too
has not changed since listing.
Bright Bright
TI/lartin Bright Steels Ltd volume of
orders in hand indicates that turn-
over and profits for the current six
months should be maintained, directors
say in their interim report. Sales and pro-
fit for the December half-year were
higher than for the previous correspond-
ing period.
Interim dividend of 5 p.c. suggests
continuance of the 10 p.c. rate estab-
lished five years ago. The 10s. shares,
now selling for 255., yield 4 p.c.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Is Broking a Profession?
A case for some higher learning
Qome people measure the worth of an
institution by the cars parked out-
side it. These same people would have
been most impressed with the invest-
ment school at Armidale the other week.
The silver Rolls Royce representing
NSW stole the show, although Queens-
land put up a good performance with
a Mercedes and Victoria was not far
behind with a Pontiac.
These investment schools have been
going for some years and are a good
example of the more specialised ap-
proach that’s now being taken to invest-
ment analysis. Not that they are before
their time. For many years, stockbroking
has been quite erroneously referred to as
a profession. For anyone who cares to
pick up an Oxford Dictionary will find
that a profession “involves some branch
of learning”. Until a few years ago, that
was one thing that was not necessary
to become a broker.
Perhaps this rebellious attitude against
the “profession” is caused by my broker
asking me to cover the CSR and Captain
Products. Although a few pounds profit
was made on the CSR, I was disap-
pointed that the shares had not fallen
more. The world price of sugar has
receded even further to £stg23. Now
I will just have to sit on the sidelines
and watch the share price from there.
Captain Products was another story. By
buying back at 795. 6d., I managed to
clear £23.
That same service which so conveni-
ently shoved the price of Captain Pro-
ducts up to 84s. has now come out
with a declaration that R. and N. Sta-
tham is the buy of the moment. A few
months ago the shares were at 11s.
For a company supplying a cyclical
industry, this was probably a very fair
.price. Now the shares are touching 15s.
it is a very different story. To warrant
this price, last year’s earning rate of
27 p.c. will have to be at least main-
tained. Because of the increase in capital
this would mean almost a 40 p.c. in-
crease in profits.
By shorting R. and N. Statham shares
at 14s. 9d. I’m hoping to create a credit
to offset my two purchases this week
Treloar and ISAS (NSW). Neither is a
newcomer to the portfolio.
In fact, Treloar left the portfolio only
in December. Since then the shares rose
over the 20s. mark early in January,
only to fall back to 17s. this week. It
seems more a case of apathy on the
part of the market rather than an indica-
tion that there has been any faltering in
the strong rate of growth.
ISAS (NSW) has also come back a
few shillings without any apparent justi-
fication. A good interim report some
months ago and the announcement of
a l-for-4 par issue has been forgotten
by the market. Now that I’ve bought
400 at 235. I hope the market regains
its memory.
To complete the bevy of transactions
this week was the sale of 600 Pyrox at
3s. 9d., giving a neat little profit of
£l2. In time these shares should go over
45., but I’m quite satisfied with the trans-
action.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Long-term, Beneficial Link
Mutual Acceptance's contact with Chartered Bank
T\uring the financial year ending on
” June 30, 1965, Mutual Acceptance
Co. Ltd will have to renew or repay
£8.4 million of debentures, unsecured
notes and deposits. While it can be
assumed that the “Receivables” (to use
the terminology of Note 3 to the ac-
counts) will be more than sufficient to
meet this obligation, the feeling cannot
be escaped that this build-up of maturi-
ties must have caused the company some
concern. The link with the Chartered
Bank, therefore, seems to have come at
a most opportune time.
The actual cash provided by the share
issue to the Bank will in itself take care
of nearly 23 p.c. of the maturities due
during the current financial year and,
with the normal raisings by debentures,
the position is perhaps little different
from what it would have been in many
other years. The main problem is that
ordinary capital will be increased to
£3,203.725 and maintenance of the 15
p.c. dividend rate will take an annual
payment in the future of £480,559. So
far as it is possible to judge, Mutual
has never in its history earned more
than 87 p.c. of this figure.
Just recently, it was also announced
that Mutual had acquired R and G
Finances from A. G. Healing. It would
seem that this deal involved a payment
of £75,000 for the equity of R and G
Finances and the assumption of R and
G’s liabilities of about £2.7 million.
These liabilities were presumably to
A. G. Healing and are to be repaid over
two years. This will increase Mutual’s
liabilities due within two years to about
£13.6 million.
On the other hand, the fact that
£75,000 was paid for the equity pre-
sumes that R and G was profitable, al-
though the price suggests that the
profits are unlikely to exceed £lO,OOO.
It could be that R and G had some past
losses that have a value, so the prospec-
tive earnings may be much less than
£lO.OOO. If we can be guided by
Mutual’s earnings in relation to total
assets, the figure could be much higher,
for these would suggest that on total
assets of £2.7 million an amount of
£46,000 would be earned. But again,
the stock market would value the equity
entitled to such earnings (on the basis
of Mutual’s share price) at about
£450,000.
At this stage, it may be as well to
examine the trends in the type of busi-
ness that Mutual has been undertaking
over the last five years, so far as this
can be judged by the balance sheet
figures. Unfortunately, we can only use
fairly broad categories, though the
figures will indicate the extent to which
diversification has taken place into
leasing and property development, if not
into motor financing.
Year to June 30 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
(£'000)
Receivable (gross) 16435 18172 18233 19897 21431
Leasing (net) 1922 2442 2204 2734 3104
Real estate 182 338 543 286
These figures do not give any idea of
the extent to which the group has enter-
ed into the field of real estate financing.
In the 1962 annual report, the figure
for “property” mortgages was shown as
£6,183,727, out of total gross receive-
ables of £18,181,135. (“Other debtors”
of £52,201 must be added to this latter
figure to arrive at the amount shown in
the schedule.) Since that annual report,
this break-up has been replaced with one
that only gives an indication of the
“ageing” of the receivables.
Tt is interesting to note that property
development was not taken very far.
Another point of interest is that, al-
though the item “Unsold shares in com-
pleted home unit project—at net cost”
decreased by £256,835 during 1963-64,
the consolidated balance sheet shows a
new investment in “Income-producing
real property at cost less provision for
depreciation on plant (£583)” of
£261,608.
However, without details of the pro-
fits which emerge from each type of
financing, the proportions of the total
assets are only of academic interest. It
becomes necessary to look at the trends
in overall profitability. For this purpose
I have selected the ratio between aver-
age total assets (net of income to mature
and depreciation on leased equipment)
and net profit (after depreciation but
before income tax and interest on de-
bentures, unsecured notes and deposits).
The ratio for the four years to June 30,
1964, is as follows (this ratio cannot be
calculated prior to this period):
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964
Percentages 10.0 10.1 9.8 9.5
The declining trend is usually notice-
able in any finance company and is pro-
bably due to the intense competition
which exists. One answer to this pro-
blem lies in higher gearing so that,
although the downward trend may con-
tinue, the equity capital draws from a
larger base. Another is to reduce the
costs of borrowing, that is, the interest
rate.
The recent addition to the share-
holders’ funds from the capital issued
to the Chartered Bank means that bor-
rowings at at June 30, 1964, could be
increased by £17.5 million. Over the
last four years, the average cost of bor-
rowings has been about 7.8 p.c. It is
suggested that the backing of the Char-
tered Bank will enable Mutual to lower
the rates of interest that it will have to
offer to the public to obtain support for
its loan raisings. For the moment this
seems unlikely, as we seem to be in a
period of rising interest rates. This
could mean that the opportunity pre-
sented by the large renewals mentioned
early may have to be missed. If this
should be so, then it may take some
little time to make any noticeable re-
duction in the average rate.
Another problem would seem to be
one of obtaining profitable business.
That has frequently proved to be very
difficult in recent years, if the results of
some of the “credit” retailers are any
guide.
We are therefore left with the thought
that the link with the Bank will prove
to be beneficial in the long-term, for,
if the return on funds can be stabilised
at, say, 9 p.c. and the average borrowing
rate can be reduced to, say. 7 p.c.,
then there is the potential for Mutual to
earn approximately double the amount
that was earned in 1963-64. This
would mean about Is. 23d per share, so
that the prospective earnings yield based
on a price of about 10s. would be 12
p.c. While this is certain'y an attractive
return, at this stage it cannot be said
how long it is likely to take to achieve.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Well on the Mend
Gambling on a Pyrox dividend
TGV>r those with a streak of the gambler
in them, Pyrox Ltd’s ss. shares are
worth buying on the chance of a return
to dividends in the current year. The
chairman, Mr August Hoette, describes
the prospects as “reasonable”. The com-
pany has always been a generous payer
in relation to earning rates. A declaration
this year should take the shares back to
par or higher, depending on the size of
and the cover for the dividend. Current
prices are around 3s. 9d.
This price also makes the shares
worthy of consideration by the slightly
more conservative investor. He must be
prepared, however, to hang on until the
1965-66 year, when the recoveries in-
dicated later in this review will almost
definitely warrant a dividend, unless they
have already done so by the end of the
current year. Buying under these con-
ditions is made more attractive by the
net tangible asset backing of ss. 4d. a
share, on top of the fact that market
prices are well below par.
Registered in Victoria in September
1922 as Robert Bosch Supply and Service
Co. Pty Ltd, the company changed its
name to Pyrox Pty Ltd in August, 1930.
This company was eventually liquidated;
a new one with the same name was regis-
tered in June, 1937, and converted to a
public company ten years later. Today,
production comes from factories in Carl-
ton, Moorabbin and Thomastown.
Branch offices are maintained in Concord
(NSW), Brisbane, Adelaide and West
Perth.
Broadly, activities fall into five cate-
gories: sound and projection equipment
(including television), gas appliances and
radiant heaters, prestressed and precast
concrete products, scientific instruments
and cameras etc., and those deriving
from a frightening list of overseas
agencies. One of the largest of these was
with .he Fried. Krupp group of Germany.
However, representation will be termina-
ted at the end of the current financial
year because it has not been remunera-
tive for some time and future prospects
do not warrant retention.
The Krupp agency covers a gigantic
number of items ranging from conveyor
belt systems to cranes, blast furnaces and
bridges. As with most of its other agen-
cies, Pyrox secures local contracts on be-
half of the overseas principal. As far as
Krupp is concerned, one of the biggest
this year will be a 250 ton floating crane
ordered by the Melbourne Harbor Trust.
Apart from agencies for Askania (sur-
veying instruments and industrial control
equipment), Bauer (sound projectors),
Mannesmann (tubes, pipes and pressure
vessels), Reicherter (hardness and spring
testing equipment), Schlosser (machin-
ery for producing concrete blocks and
bricks), Siemens and Halske (television
stations and associated equipment),
Sovaco (process for production of metal-
lurgical coke), Voith (water turbines,
pulp and paper machinery) and Weiler-
Brauer K. G. (prestressing sliding
moulds), there are five other agencies
which hold particular interest.
With the Schwank organisation, the
group produces Pyrox Schwank radiant
heaters which have been seeing rapid in-
creases in popularity for both the home
and industry. Increased use in housing
projects, particularly in Victoria and SA,
indicate still higher sales in the current
year for the heaters as well as the Pyro-
Flo hot water units. Higher turnovers
are also expected for the products of the
Leitz agency with the establishment of
new universities and hospitals through-
out Australia. Leitz products cover
microscopes, measuring instruments,
cameras and projectors.
Orders for Fernsch television studio
equipment this year already exceed the
total turnover of last year. Further order
prospects are excellent, according to
directors. A number of offers are at
present being prepared for more tonnage
oxygen plants for industry from the
Linde agency. The steel industry is ex-
pected to place more orders in the current
year. Linde agency work covers the sup-
ply and erection of complete plants for
the production of oxygen, nitrogen and
liquefaction of gases new fields in in-
dustry are being investigated and, once
again, hold promise, according to direc-
tors. Finally, large orders have been
received and more are expected for
Zimmerman and Jansen control equip-
ment for blast furnaces.
Under its own name (apart from the
heaters already mentioned), the group
produces tape recorders, dictating
machines, sound projectors, gas heaters,
concrete products, meteorological and
hydrological recorders, electrical integra-
tors and knife sharpeners.
Unfulfilled orders for concrete pro-
ducts already exceed last year’s total
turnover. Several new products have
been introduced, in particular a flooring
system for which substantial orders are
on hand. The concrete division generally

is still waiting on the outcome of a num-
ber of contracts tendered for. If a reason-
able share of these are won, the division’s
profitability is assured, as the sales de-
partment has now been reorganised and
the factory is almost operating to capa-
city.
It was the establishment of this fac-
tory, together with a sharp fall in the'in-
come from contracts secured on behalf
of overseas principals, high expenses in-
volved in the development of a new tape
recorder and the liquidation and revalua-
tion of stocks, which brought about the
loss in the 1962-63 year (see accom-
panying table). The fall in contract in-
come was not 'unexpected, as results can
vary violently from year to year depend-
ing on local requirements. The recovery
in 1963-64 was due to the absence of
some of these expenses, plus a general
increase in all sales, wider demand for
concrete products and increased income
from overseas contracts.
So things are obviously on the mend.
The future is probably best summarised
by the directors, who said in their
annual report "there are clear indications
that the improving trend in the com-
pany's profits will continue and be acce-
lerated during the ensuing year. Re-
organisation of operations have been
effected to improve efficiency, resulting
in worthwhile economies. The estimated
results from sales already made and
those in sight show reasonable prospects
for the payment of a dividend in 1964-
65. Future trading years can therefore
be faced with justifiable optimism”.
The interim report, which usually
arrives in February, will be the best
indicator of the chances for a dividend
this year. There will not necessarily be
an interim payout if directors see virtue
in withholding any decision until the full
year's results are at hand. Generosity
should be the keynote if the relationship
shown between earnings p.c. and divi-
dends p.c. in the accompanying table is
any indication.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Wheat Sales and Foreign Policy
No harm to Australia’s external interests
By Dr H. D. ALBINSKI
some time many Australians have
evinced concern over their coun-
try’s heavy credit wheat sales to China.
Among the criticisms has been the
charge that these sales somehow con-
flicted with Australia's foreign policy
interests. As Dr T. B. Millar of the
ANU recently put it, Australia should
work toward “taking diplomacy away
from the Australian Wheat Board and
giving it to the Department of External
Affairs—or at least making sure that
External Affairs and Trade work to-
gether”. It would therefore seem appro-
priate to take a closer look at the
questions such charges imply. Has the
Wheat Board carried out its business
with China without or contrary to the
Government’s permission? Has the
Government been unwilling to intrude
into the wheat sales on behalf of foreign
policy interests? Have the Chinese
purchases been applied as a political
pressure point against Australia?
The Government’s legal right to inter-
vene in the Wheat Board's conduct of
business is perfectly clear. The 1963
wheat stabilisation legislation, which
recapitulates an established rule, states
flatly that “the Minister may give direc-
tions to the Board concerning the per-
formance of its functions and the exer-
cise of its powers, and the Board shall
comply with those directions”. But the
Board has chosen to acquaint itself with
Government thinking without waiting
for instructions. As early as 1954 it
made queries through official External
Affairs sources in Canberra about the
Government’s reactions if wheat were to
be sold to China, and was told there
was no objection. The substantial cash
sale in December, 1960, and the first
credit sale early in 1961 were made
with the Government's knowledge and
consent.
From 1961 onward the Government
has set down the general guideline that
sales would need to be made at prices
not substantially below world levels.
This injunction has been observed.
Allegations that the Chinese have been
sold wheat at artificially low prices are
entirely misleading. The Board has bar-
gained with China in the same way as
it has with others—to receive the best
price in the light of world supply con-
ditions and the quality of wheat being
sold. Since China has bought consider-
able second grade wheat, a false impres-
sion has been created that she was being
favored with unreasonably low prices.
At any rate, after the first credit sale
the Government asked the Board for
“an opportunity to comment” on any
future wheat sales on terms in excess
of six months. Since all subsequent
sales to China have been on terms longer
than six months, it is plain that there
has been routine consultation following
the first credit deal. From such con-
sultations emerged the only known in-
stance of a Governmental directive
being delivered to the Wheat Board
regarding sales to China.
In 1963, France and Canada extended
credit wheat sales to China on an 18-
month basis and the Chinese requested
comparable terms from Australia. When
the Australian Government learned of
this, it in effect instructed the Wheat
Board people to return to the confer-
ence table and not yield beyond the
established twelve-month practice. It is
impossible to say if the Government
would have allowed 18 months had the
Chinese, thrown down an ultimatum, but
they did not, and accepted 12 months.
Economic reasons were paramount in
the Government’s mind. Political con-
siderations also were involved. For the
present purpose, however, the foreign
policy factor must be noticed. The US
had already held discussions with Aus-
tralia about the China trade. It would
appear that these were discussions as
such, not protests or representations in
the ordinary sense of those words, but
they included contacts at the highest
levels—perhaps as high as Kennedy-
Menzles, definitely as high as Rusk-
Barwick.
America stressed the wheat on credit
aspect of Australia’s trade with China,
underscoring the dangers of over-
dependence on a Communist buying
source and likewise mentioning that
credit was really a form of foreign aid
to a near-enemy country. In 1963, inci-
dentally, while the Cuban missile crisis
was still fresh in mind, the Chinese paid
for a shipment of Australian wheat
which was shipped directly from Aus-
tralia to Cuba. Although the US does
not embargo food and medical sales to
Cuba, it was sensitive about the wheat
transaction, presumably because of its
Chinese auspices, and communicated
its feelings to Australia. Because of
Australia's traditional unwillingness to
strain her American alliance, and in
1963 her particular hope of attracting
America’s active and sympathetic inter-

est toward Canberra’s view of the deve-
loping Malaysian crisis, it is plausible
to reason that the decision not to permit
18 months of credit to China was in
part dictated by foreign policy con-
siderations.
Indeed, when in September of 1961
the Government advised the Wheat
Board that it was not prepared to insure
credit sales to China under the “national
interest” clause of the Export Payments
Insurance Corporation legislation, a
comparable set of circumstances applied.
There were strong economic and politi-
cal reasons not to proceed with insur-
ance w'hich would be underwritten with
Commonwealth funds, but the impact on
relations with America, whose support
on West Irian was then being feverishly
sought, should not be discounted.
At the time of the Sino-Indian border
conflict in 1962 the Government sup-
plied various forms of assistance to
India, yet did not curtail trade with
China. It saw the conflict as serious,
though not a genuine war between India
and China, noticing that Sino-Indian
diplomatic relations had not even been
broken off. Although the Indian High
Commissioner in Ottawa discussed Sino-
Canadian trade with the Canadian Ex-
ternal Affairs Minister, there apparently
were no comparable talks held in Can-
berra—certainly not with Sir Garfield
Barvvick. There are intimations that, if
the fighting had remained severe for a
longer time, Australia would have re-
appraised her permissive wheat credit
sale policy tow'ard China, though events
made this unnecessary. In other words,
while the Government did not find im-
mediate and compelling reasons to step
in, the possibility of doing so was under
consideration.
In the late ’fifties —before any signi-
ficant wheat sales were made to China
—there was a difference of opinion in
Cabinet regarding the wisdom of full
endorsement for encouraging trade with
China. Certain press reports of the time
grossly exaggerated the situation.
There w ; as no split, only differences in
degree. R. G. Casey, as he was then,
urged a gradual approach to the China
trade, and his position was designed to
avoid any undue shocks to America. I
am not aw'are that the and
lucrative wheat sales to China came
about onlv after some faction or other in
Cabinet, likewise sensitive about Ameri-
can opinion, w'as overruled. Volume
sales, even on credit, have not been
blocked.
What has been avoided, such as
Governmentally-sponsored insurance or
extremely lenient credit terms, would
probably have been blocked on purely
economic reasoning, and at all events
has not hindered the success of Chinese
wheat purchases in the least. Then, too,
the Government has certainly been
aware that its faithful support of many
American policies, or its circumspection
in expressing differences of view, have
placed Australia in high regard in
Washington. Such behavior helps to
serve as a shock absorber when Austra-
lia sells her wheat to China. Criticisms
from America are softer and more pri-
vate than they might be otherwise and
the chances of American backturning on
Australia’s self-perceived security inter-
ests decline.
When appropriate, the Government
can legitimately remind the US that
Australia’s economic viability depends
on her ability to sell abroad. America
should therefore not be surprised that
when she herself imposes quotas on Aus-
tralian lead and zinc, as she did in 1958,
or discriminates against Australian wool,
meat and cheese, or undercuts the
market for Australian wheat in India
because of the US surplus food pro-
gramme under Public Law 480, Aus-
tralia moves where she can to trade,
including selling her wheat to China.
What of Chinese behavior? Have the
huge Australian wheat sales to China —
which in 1963-64 represented over half
of the country's overseas wheat sales —
been exploited by China for political
leverage? The answer need not be un-
duly labored, because it is an unequi-
vocal “no”. There have been no
Chinese pronouncements to the effect
that the continuation of Chinese wheat-
or any other purchases from Australia
was in any way dependent on curbing
“hostile” conduct such as support for
Formosa, or voting against Peking’s
seating at the UN, or allowing the
North-West Cape station to be built, or
continuing in ANZUS and SEATO, or
aiding Malaysia, or anything else.
Chinese trade delegations visiting Aus-
tralia have not made pleas for diplo-
matic relations. Australians travelling
to China, on business or otherwise, have
had no hints that continuing trade would
depend on the gift of recognition or
anything else. Some business delega-
tions have been told that an exchange
of diplomatic representatives could im-
prove the efficiency of trade, but this
does not apply respecting wheat trans-
actions and at all events has carried no
connotation of threat.
There appear to be sound reasons
why, respecting Australia, China has not
used political leverage and probably will
not in the foreseeable future. First, to be
blunt, Australia is not as great a prize
as Japan, which has suffered Chinese
pressure. If China wishes to run the
various international risks, i.e., forfeiting
her commercial reputation, which would
result from political blackmail, she
would probably aim at a more signifi-
cant target than Australia. Secondly,
Australia’s political scene is such that


HELP
LEGACY
all the year
round
she is far less susceptible to pressure,
contrary to what the DLP and NCC
might say, than a country with Japan’s
politics. Not even an ALP Govern-
ment, both because of conviction and an
eye on public reaction, could be ex-
pected to surrender to political threats.
Thirdly, China continues to find Austra-
Ha’s goods useful. She has various
shortages of her own, despite recent
economic improvement. Her trade with
the Soviet bloc has declined substan-
tially and any conscious halting of pri-
mary products commerce with sellers
such as Australia or Canada would be
much like cutting off the nose to spite
the face.
Australia's wheat sales to China have
been attacked on a variety of grounds,
Whatever the validity of some of the
criticisms might be, it is wrong to assert
that the Government has given carte
blanche to the Wheat Board and has
not exercised its right to apply foreign
policy considerations to the transactions.
On balance, there is no visible evidence
that, to the degree that the Government
has been permissive, Australia’s external
interests have been harmed, or indeed
that there is prospect that Australia may
soon need to choose between surrender-
ing such sales or capitulating to Chinese
demands for a reorientation of her
foreign policy.
Shifting the Wheat Crop
What terminal for Southern Riverina?
Asa gambler the Australian farmer is
very definitely an eachway man.
Consider this Section 92 business.
The Australian Primary Producers’
Union is one of those farm organisations
which supports a move to have Section
92 of the Constitution amended so that
interstate price cutting of farm produce
can be abolished. Yet at the very same
time a section of the same APPU, in
the Southern Riverina, is using Section
92, as it stands now, as an argument
in favor of moving Southern Riverina
wheat permanently through Victoria to
the Geelong terminal for export.
This year, as an emergency measure,
a good part of the Southern Riverina
crop will go to Geelong. Many South-
ern Riverina wheat farmers say that
Geelong should logically be their ter-
minal in all seasons, emergency or other-
wise, because it is about half as distant
as Sydney or Newcastle in NSW. But as
things stand now, NSW wheat can move
to Geelong only if the Grain Elevators
Boards of both States come to a work-
ing agreement.
Both States have bumper crops this
year. Both railway systems are strained
to handle it. In many areas farmers are
putting up temporary on-farm storages.
In both States the current rail-lift is
concerned with the overflow wheat—
that is wheat which cannot be stored in
existing structures. These are chock-a-
block. It is, without any doubt, the
biggest wheat lift of all time in Australia.
Since 1956-57, wheat acreage has in-
creased from eight million to nearly
eighteen million acres. Over the last
five years the average harvest has been
more than 300 million bushels a year,
compared with the previous five-year
best of 194 million. This year’s harvest
may reach the all-time high of 360 mil-
Jion bushels.
The moving of the wheat is giving the
NSW and Victorian railways a head-
ache, but despite many difficulties—
naturally felt more keenly in localised
wheat districts —the job seems to be
going ahead on schedule. Perhaps sche-
dule is not the right word because the
schedule has, in fact, been disrupted
somewhat by the late harvest in the
southern part of the continent.
Trucks used for wheat over the
Christmas and New Year holiday periods
are now being required for industry.
Victoria/ has no special bulk wheat
trucks at all, and it is nearly all bulk
handling these days. NSW has some
specially constructed bulk trucks but
not enough.
It is an easy thing to say that con-
struction of special bulk carriers is
urgently required. Who will pay for
them, though? The trouble with the
special wheat truck is that it lies idle
most of the year. The normal type of
truck can be used for carrying anything
and everything.
The increasing use of bulk super-
phosphate may solve the problem of
making the special wheat trucks pay
their way. In theory the trucks could
be used to take wheat down to the
seaboard and bulk super back to the
country. But after the super is emptied
out the trucks must be cleaned
thoroughly for the wheat. Few country
sidings are properly equipped to do this
job.
The State Railways have problems all
right and these become magnified when
wheat is to be transported* from NSW
to the Geelong terminal in Victoria. In
previous years the NSW wheat has been
loaded on the Yarrawonga broad gauge
line which runs up into the Southern
Riverina. No unusual problem there.
If NSW wheat could come down the
standard gauge line to Melbourne and
then on to Geelong (only about 40
miles), the time factor could be halved.
Quicker turn-around would mean more
wheat moved.
The Southern Riverina section of the
APPU is trying to get a movement going
to have the standard gauge extended
from Melbourne to Geelong so that a
speedy run through could be brought
into existence. Politicians and railways
executives are not too enthusiastic about
this idea. It’s great in principle, but
what about the cost?
Yet the idea seems likely to bear
fruit, only in a different way. Multiple-
bogey trucks are the answer and Victoria
does have some of these (NSW has not,
unfortunately). If enough multiple-bogey
trucks can be provided the wheat could
come down the standard gauge to
Dynon (just outside Melbourne) and
these same trucks could then be ad-
justed to fit the broad gauge line down
to Geelong.
Those farmers (and there are plenty)
who believe that a Federal agency is
needed to control the lifting of the Aus-
tralian wheat harvest should at least be
a little patient and give the State authori-
ties a chance to work all this out.
Many a farmer has plenty of reason
to be dispirited about the lack of local
wheat storage, the long lines of motor
trucks waiting to disgorge wheat at the
rail sidings and the annoyance of having
to put up some kind of makeshift silo
on the farm. The time to ask for an
overall Federal control will be if, and
when, the State systems break down.
Despite the current difficulties there is
no evidence of anything like that hap-
pening at all.
Bigger country storages at the rail
sidings would help ease the problem and
permit the rail-lift to be spaced more
evenly throughout the year. All farm
organisations believe these are prefer-
able to on-farm silos because the on-
farm silo tends to deteriorate more
rapidly and, without special supervisory
staff, can become rat and weevil infested.
With or without a subsidy, the build-
ing of thousands of small on-farm silos
is still more expensive than building
million-bushel silos at the rail sidings.
Not unnaturally the Grain Elevators
Boards, and the State and Federal
Governments, are likely to be a bit
cautious about rushing in and subsi-
dising the building of dozens of new
million-bushel silos. Everyone would
like to see them. But first there is the
little problem of selling all those 360
(estimated) million bushels.

Omega Seamaster. the world’s favourite precision sports watch. Winds itself. Hermetically sealed against water. Note onyx inlay of solid
gold hour markers. 14et gold capped £95.0.0. Stainless steel £67.10.0.
The sturdy reliability of this Omega Seamaster
is proved in an atmospheric pressure chamber
Its accuracy and long life are assured by waterproofing tests in a
special simulator, unique to Omega
They take a watch. They plunge it a
hundred feet beneath the sea. Then they
suddenly catapult it to the height of
Mount Everest. And it still works
perfectly.
This happens every day with the Omega
Seamaster sports watch.
The drastic switch from a pressure of
three atmospheres to a partial vacuum
takes place in the Omega factory. In a
machine such as you will not find any-
where else in the whole watch industry.
A pressure simulator specially designed
by Omega.
Altogether, each Seamaster is “dived”
17 times. Through 17 different pressure
ranges. In the space of 45 minutes. The
tests ensure that the rugged Seamaster
case will withstand all the changes of
pressure that you can possibly encounter
in the air and beneath the sea.
And why does Omega indulge in this
costly and painstaking process? Because
the Seamaster movement is so accurate,
so finely built, that it deserves the best
protection watchmakers can give it.
Pressurizing conditions it for the rough,
tough life it has been designed to live.
For the life of a sportsman.
It will be a long life, too.
No wonder the sturdy accurate Sea-
master is praised wherever it goes by
parachutists, skin-divers, mountaineers,
racing motorists and countless other
sportsmen who lead a full, active life.
No wonder the Omega Seamaster is the
most sought-after precision watch in
the world.
Some day you, too, will own an Omega.
